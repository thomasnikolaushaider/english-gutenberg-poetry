   <p>THE</p>
   <p>POEMS OF PHILIP FRENEAU</p>
   <p>In February , 1790 , Freneau left the sea and settled down in the employ of the New York Daily Advertiser . During the next seven years he was successively editor of the National Gazette , The Jersey Chronicle , and The Time Piece and Literary Companion . The period ends late in 1797 when he left New York and went for a time to Charleston , South Carolina .</p>

     <l n="6">This rude , resounding shore —</l>
     <l n="7">These vales impervious to the wind ,</l>

     <l n="13">You saw him , last , retreat !</l>
     <l n="14">With towering crest , you first appear</l>
     <l n="15">The news of land to tell ;</l>
     <l n="16">To him that comes , fresh joys impart ,</l>
     <l n="17">To him that goes , a heavy heart ,</l>

     <l n="28">Your thousand springs of waters blue</l>

     <l n="33">Where forests round them rise ,</l>

     <l n="41">Let those who pant for wealth or fame</l>
     <l n="42">Pursue the watery road ;—</l>
     <l n="43">Soft sleep and ease , blest days and nights ,</l>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>The first trace I can find of this poem is in the Freeman 's Journal , February 2 , 1791 , where it is entitled “ Stanzas written on the Hills of Neversink near Sandy Hook , 1790 . ” In the republication of the poem in the National Gazette , November 28 , 1791 , the month “ July ” was added to the title . It was the poet 's valedictory to the ocean after his wanderings . He was married in May , 1790 , and he now evidently looked forward to a settled career . The poem has been placed slightly out of order as will be seen . It was republished only in the 1795 edition which the text follows . The first five lines of the original version were as follows :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ In early days and vanished years</l>
     <l n="2">To rougher toils resigned ,</l>

     <l n="4">And leave true bliss behind ;</l>

    <head>THE RISING EMPIRE<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span></head>
    <head>ON AMERICAN ANTIQUITY .<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span></head>
     <l n="1">America , to every climate known ,</l>
     <l n="2">Spreads her broad bosom to the burning zone ,</l>
     <l n="3">To either pole extends her vast domain</l>
     <l n="4">Where varying suns o'er different summers reign .</l>
     <l n="5">Wide wandering streams , vast plains , and pathless woods ,</l>
     <l n="6">Bold shores , confined by circumscribing floods ,</l>
     <l n="7">Denote this land , whose fertile , flowery breast</l>
     <l n="8">Teems with all life — and man , its nobler guest .</l>
     <l n="9">In days of old , from ocean 's deepest bed ,</l>
     <l n="10">Gulphs unexplored , and countries of the dead ,</l>
     <l n="11">Rous 'd by some voice , that shook all nature 's frame ,</l>
     <l n="12">From the vast depths this new creation came :</l>
     <l n="13">Perpetual change its varying nature feels ,</l>
     <l n="14">The wave once flow 'd that now with frost congeals ,</l>
     <l n="15">Suns on its breast have shed a feebler fire ,</l>
     <l n="16">Oceans have roll 'd where mountains now aspire .</l>
     <l n="17">The soil 's proud lord a changeful temper knows ,</l>
     <l n="18">From differing earths his various nature grows :</l>
     <l n="19">Long , long before the time that sophists plan</l>
     <l n="20">Existed in these woods the race of man ,</l>
     <l n="21">Warm 'd into life by some creating flame ,</l>
     <l n="22">All worlds pervading , and through all , the same !</l>
     <l n="23">Not from the west their swarthy tribes they brought ,</l>
     <l n="24">As Europe 's pride and Asia 's folly taught ;—</l>
     <l n="25">With the same ease the great disposing power</l>
     <l n="26">Produced a man , a reptile , or a flower :—</l>
     <l n="27">See the swift deer , in lonely wilds that strays ,</l>
     <l n="28">See the tall elk , that in the valley plays ,</l>
     <l n="29">See the fierce tiger 's raging , ravenous band ,</l>
     <l n="30">And wolves ( their race as ancient as the land )</l>
     <l n="31">Did these of old from bleak Kamschatka come ,</l>
     <l n="32">And traverse seas , to find a happier home ?—</l>
     <l n="33">No ?— from the dust , this common dust , they drew</l>
     <l n="34">Their different forms , proud man , that moulded you .</l>
     <l n="35">At first , half beasts , untaught to till the land ,</l>
     <l n="36">Careless , you fed from Nature 's fostering hand ;</l>
     <l n="37">In depths of deserts dream 'd your lives away ,</l>
     <l n="38">Sought no new worlds , nor look 'd beyond to-day :</l>
     <l n="39">The Almighty power , that lives and breathes through all ,</l>
     <l n="40">Bade some faint rays on these dark nations fall ;</l>
     <l n="41">Early , to them did reasoning souls impart ,</l>
     <l n="42">Inventive genius , and some dawn of art ;</l>
     <l n="43">Then left them here , with sense enough to win ,</l>
     <l n="44">Or cheat the bear , or panther of his skin ;</l>
     <l n="45">Mean huts to build , regardless of their form ,</l>
     <l n="46">Completely blest , if shelter 'd from the storm ;</l>
     <l n="47">To see the seasons change , day turn to night :</l>
     <l n="48">Bow to the lamps of heaven that gave them light ,</l>
     <l n="49">Beam 'd on the spring , or bade the summer glow ,</l>
     <l n="50">Their harvests ripen , and their gardens grow —</l>

    <head>A VIEW OF RHODE ISLAND<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span></head>
     <l n="1">Wash 'd by surrounding seas , and bold her coasts ,</l>
     <l n="2">A grateful soil the fair Rhode Island boasts .</l>
     <l n="3">The admiring eye no happier fields can trace ,</l>
     <l n="4">Here seas are crowned with the scaly race ,</l>
     <l n="5">Nature has strove to make her native blest</l>
     <l n="6">And owns no fairer Eden in the west :</l>
     <l n="7">Here lovliest dames in frequent circles seen ,</l>
     <l n="8">Catch the fine tint of health from beauty 's queen ,</l>
     <l n="9">No aid they want to seize the enraptur 'd view</l>
     <l n="10">Nor art 's false colours to improve the true ;</l>
     <l n="11">Here , love the traveller holds — loth to depart</l>
     <l n="12">Some charming creature slays his wandering heart ,</l>
     <l n="13">Bids him forget from clime to clime to rove ,</l>
     <l n="14">And even dull prudence — here — submits to love .</l>
     <l n="15">On grassy farms , their souls enslav 'd to gain ,</l>
     <l n="16">Reside the masters of the rural reign ;</l>
     <l n="17">Vast herds they feed , that glut the abundant pail ,</l>
     <l n="18">Break the stiff sod , or freight the adventurous sail ;</l>
     <l n="19">The nervous steed , the stanchest of the kind</l>
     <l n="20">Here walks his rounds in pastures unconfin 'd :—</l>
     <l n="21">Half that the lands produce or seas contain</l>
     <l n="22">To other shores transported o'er the main</l>
     <l n="23">Returns in coin , to cheer the miser 's eye ,</l>
     <l n="24">In foreign sweets , that fancied wants supply ,</l>
     <l n="25">Or tawdry stuffs , to deck the limbs of pride ,</l>
     <l n="26">That thus expends what avarice strove to hide .</l>
     <l n="27">But , hostile to themselves , this jarring race</l>
     <l n="28">In desperate interests , different plans embrace —</l>
     <l n="29">One , bold in wrong , his paper fabric rears</l>
     <l n="30">And steels his bosom to the orphan 's tears</l>
     <l n="31">To those he ruin 'd grants no late relief !</l>
     <l n="32">But leaves the wretched to subsist on grief !</l>
     <l n="33">In lost advice his days the gownsman spends ,</l>
     <l n="34">He gives his prayers and teachings to the winds ,—</l>

     <l n="37">Talk not of Laws !— where innocence must fall ,</l>
     <l n="38">One spark of honour more than damns them all ;</l>
     <l n="39">And vainly Science her assistance lends</l>
     <l n="40">Where knavery shapes it to the basest ends ,</l>
     <l n="41">Fraud walks at large ,— each selfish passion reigns ,</l>
     <l n="42">And cheats enforce what honesty disdains .</l>
     <l n="43">Hurt at the view , I leave the ungrateful shore</l>
     <l n="44">And thy rough soil , Connecticut , explore :</l>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>In the Charleston City Gazette or Daily Advertiser of February 2 , 1790 , appeared “ A Characteristic Sketch of the Long Island Dutch . From The Rising Empire : a Poem . ” Two days later the New York Daily Advertiser published “ A View of Rhode Island . [ Extracted from a new Poem , entitled The Rising Empire , not yet published . ] ” That Freneau for a time was actively engaged upon this projected volume is evident from the poems on the states which appeared in the Daily Advertiser , chiefly during the month of March , 1790 . The last of these poems , “ A Descriptive Sketch of Virginia , ” appeared June 11 , 1790 . On June 25 Freneau issued proposals for a new volume of poems , presumably to bear the title “ The Rising Empire , ” but the volume was never published . Many of the pieces that undoubtedly would have gone to make up the book appeared in the Daily Advertiser . Of those that came directly under the title ( and they are doubtless but a fragment of what the poet intended to write ) all but “ A View of Rhode Island ” appeared in a greatly changed form in the poet 's later volumes . I have followed in each case the edition of 1809 .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 25 ]</span>In the Daily Advertiser of June 12 , 1790 , there appeared from the pen of Freneau a long article entitled “ Description of New-York one Hundred years hence , By a Citizen of those Times : ” The following is an extract :</p>
   <p>“ At the South western part of this city formerly stood a strong fort , with stone walls , near thirty feet in height , upon which were mounted a considerable number of large pieces of cannon . This fortress was originally constructed by the Dutch possessors of the place to defend the town , then in its infancy , from the insults of pirates on the one side , and the aborigines of the country on the other . After this territory fell into the hands of the English nation , the fort was at different times enlarged , strengthened and repaired , and was the usual place of residence for the British Governors , who , in the true spirit of European royalty and despotism chose to live separate from their fellow-citizens , and in several instances treated them with a degree of contempt and disrespect proportionate to the confidence they had in the number of their cannon , and in the strength of the walls and ramparts that surrounded them .</p>
   <p>“ History mentions that in the year 1790 , fourteen years after this republic had shaken off its yoke of foreign bondage , this fort was totally demolished by an edict of the Senate , and the space it occupied employed to better purpose in making room for those elegant streets and buildings which now adorn this quarter of the city . ”</p>
   <p>The poem appeared in the issue of March 9 , 1790 , and was entitled “ On the proposed demolition of Fort George , in this City . ” The text of the 1809 edition has been followed .</p>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">On a fine Sunday morning I mounted my steed</l>
     <l n="3">And southward from Hartford had meant to proceed ;</l>
     <l n="4">My baggage was stow 'd in a cart very snug ,</l>
     <l n="5">Which Ranger , the gelding , was destined to lug ;</l>
     <l n="6">With his harness and buckles , he loom 'd very grand ,</l>
     <l n="7">And was drove by young Darby , a lad of the land —</l>
     <l n="8">On land , or on water , most handy was he ,</l>
     <l n="9">A jockey on shore , and a sailor at sea ,</l>
     <l n="10">He knew all the roads , he was so very keen</l>
     <l n="11">And the Bible by heart , at the age of fifteen .</l>
     <l n="12">As thus I jogg 'd on , to my saddle confined ,</l>
     <l n="13">With Ranger and Darby a distance behind ;</l>
     <l n="14">At last in full view of a steeple we came</l>
     <l n="15">With a cock on the spire ( I suppose he was game ;</l>
     <l n="16">A dove in the pulpit may suit your grave people ,</l>
     <l n="17">But always remember — a cock on the steeple )</l>
     <l n="18">Cries Darby — “ Dear master , I beg you to stay ;</l>
     <l n="19">Believe me , there 's danger in driving this way ;</l>
     <l n="20">Our deacons on Sundays have power to arrest</l>
     <l n="21">And lead us to church — if your honour thinks best —</l>
     <l n="22">Though still I must do them the justice to tell ,</l>
     <l n="23">They would choose you should pay them the fine — full as well . ”</l>
     <l n="24">The fine ( said I ) Darby , how much may it be —</l>
     <l n="25">A shilling or sixpence ?— why , now let me see ,</l>
     <l n="26">Three shillings are all the small pence that remain ,</l>
     <l n="27">And to change a half joe would be rather profane .</l>
     <l n="28">Is it more than three shillings , the fine that you speak on ;</l>
     <l n="29">What say you good Darby — will that serve the deacon .</l>
     <l n="30">“ Three shillings ( cried Darby ) why , master , you 're jesting !—</l>
     <l n="31">Let us luff while we can and make sure of our westing —</l>
     <l n="32">Forty shillings , excuse me , is too much to pay</l>
     <l n="33">It would take my month 's wages — that 's all I 've to say .</l>
     <l n="34">By taking this road that inclines to the right</l>
     <l n="35">The squire and the sexton may bid us good night ,</l>
     <l n="36">If once to old Ranger I give up the rein</l>
     <l n="37">The parson himself may pursue us in vain . ”</l>
     <l n="38">“ Not I , my good Darby ( I answer 'd the lad )</l>
     <l n="39">Leave the church on the left ! they would think we were mad ;</l>
     <l n="40">I would sooner rely on the heels of my steed ,</l>
     <l n="41">And pass by them all like a Jehu indeed :—</l>
     <l n="42">As long as I 'm able to lead in the race</l>
     <l n="43">Old Ranger , the gelding , will go a good pace ,</l>
     <l n="44">As the deacon pursues , he will fly like a swallow ,</l>
     <l n="45">And you in the cart must , undoubtedly , follow . ”</l>
     <l n="46">Then approaching the church , as we pass 'd by the door</l>
     <l n="47">The sexton peep 'd out , with a saint or two more ,</l>
     <l n="48">A deacon came forward and waved us his hat ,</l>
     <l n="49">A signal to drop him some money — mind that !—</l>
     <l n="50">“ Now , Darby ( I halloo 'd ) be ready to skip ,</l>
     <l n="51">Ease off the curb bridle — give Ranger the whip :</l>
     <l n="52">While you have the rear , and myself lead the way ,</l>
     <l n="53">No doctor or deacon shall catch us this day . ”</l>
     <l n="54">By this time the deacon had mounted his poney</l>
     <l n="55">And chaced for the sake of our souls and — our money :</l>
     <l n="56">The saint , as he followed , cried — “ Stop them , halloo ! ”</l>
     <l n="57">As swift as he followed , as swiftly we flew —</l>
     <l n="58">“ Ah master ! ( said Darby ) I very much fear</l>
     <l n="59">We must drop him some money to check his career ,</l>
     <l n="60">He is gaining upon us and waves with his hat</l>
     <l n="61">There 's nothing , dear master , will stop him but that .</l>
     <l n="62">Remember the Beaver ( you well know the fable )</l>
     <l n="63">Who flying the hunters as long as he 's able ,</l>
     <l n="64">When he finds that his efforts can nothing avail</l>
     <l n="65">But death and the puppies are close at his tail ,</l>
     <l n="66">Instead of desponding at such a dead lift</l>
     <l n="67">He bites off their object , and makes a free gift —</l>
     <l n="68">Since fortune all hope of escaping denies</l>
     <l n="69">Better give them a little , than lose the whole prize . ”</l>
     <l n="70">But scarce had he spoke , when we came to a place</l>
     <l n="71">Whose muddy condition concluded the chace ,</l>
     <l n="72">Down settled the cart — and old Ranger stuck fast</l>
     <l n="73">Aha ! ( said the Saint ) have I catch 'd ye at last ?</l>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 30 ]</span>Published in the Daily Advertiser , March 22 , 1790 , under the title “ On the Demolition of Dartmouth College . ” This earliest version was introduced thus ( italics ): “ On December the 31st last , the old College at Dartmouth in New-Hampshire , was entirely demolished by the Students , notwithstanding every endeavour of the Rev . President to persuade them to desist from their unwarrantable undertaking . It stood the shock of their united efforts about 20 minutes , and then fell to the ground . ” The facts as given by Freneau are in the main true . During the absence of the second Wheelock in Europe to secure funds for the college “ Professor Woodward , ” according to Chase 's History of Dartmouth College , “ acted as chief executive and Professor Ripley resided with the family in the presidential mansion . The students , it seems , took advantage of the opportunity to rid themselves and the faculty of the little log hut , ‘ the first sprout of the college , ’ that stood near the mansion house . Being remitted to the occupancy of servants , it was by this time in a deplorable state of neglect and decay , and obnoxious to everybody . On a December evening in 1782 or 1783 Professor Ripley in the President 's house happened to be entertaining a friend from Connecticut , and dilating with much satisfaction upon the orderly behaviour of the students and the freedom from noise and disturbance . In the midst of it they became aware of an unusual commotion without , and on going to see about it , discovered a body of students assailing the log house in such a manner that in a very short time little was left of it . The professor made an effort to stay the work but the noise overpowered his voice . ” In the edition of 1795 the title was “ On the Demolition of a Log-College , ” and in the index of the edition of 1809 , the text of which I have used , the title was given “ On the Demolition of an ancient New-England College . ”</p>

     <l n="27">Seven years , my dear Nanny , they 've been on the wing ;</l>
     <l n="28">My master would rather saw timber , or dig ,</l>
     <l n="29">Than see them removing to Conegocheague ,</l>

     <l n="2">Your men of the land , from the king to Jack Ketch ,</l>
     <l n="3">All join in supposing the sailor a wretch ,</l>
     <l n="4">That his life is a round of vexation and woe ,</l>
     <l n="5">With always too much or too little to do :</l>
     <l n="6">In the dead of the night , when other men sleep ,</l>
     <l n="7">He , starboard and larboard , his watches must keep ;</l>
     <l n="8">Imprisoned by Neptune , he lives like a dog ,</l>
     <l n="9">And to know where he is , must depend on a Log ,</l>
     <l n="10">Must fret in a calm , and be sad in a storm ;</l>
     <l n="11">In winter much trouble to keep himself warm :</l>
     <l n="12">Through the heat of the summer pursuing his trade ,</l>
     <l n="13">No trees , but his topmasts , to yield him a shade :</l>
     <l n="14">Then , add to the list of the mariner 's evils ,</l>
     <l n="15">The water corrupted , the bread full of weevils ,</l>
     <l n="16">Salt junk to be eat , be it better or worse ,</l>
     <l n="17">And , often bull beef of an Irishman 's horse :</l>
     <l n="18">Whosoever is free , he must still be a slave ,</l>
     <l n="19">( Despotic is always the rule on the wave ;)</l>
     <l n="20">Not relished on water , your lords of the main</l>
     <l n="21">Abhor the republican doctrines of Paine ,</l>
     <l n="22">And each , like the despot of Prussia , may say</l>
     <l n="23">That his crew has no right , but the right to obey .</l>

     <l n="25">But things are not so bad as their fancies persuade ‘ em :</l>
     <l n="26">There ne'er was a task but afforded some ease ,</l>
     <l n="27">Nor a calling in life , but had something to please .</l>
     <l n="28">If the sea has its storms , it has also its calms ,</l>
     <l n="29">A time to sing songs and a time to sing psalms .—</l>
     <l n="30">Yes — give me a vessel well timbered and sound ,</l>
     <l n="31">Her bottom good plank , and in rigging well found ,</l>
     <l n="32">If her spars are but staunch , and her oakham swelled tight ,</l>
     <l n="33">From tempests and storms I 'll extract some delight —</l>
     <l n="34">At sea I would rather have Neptune my jailor ,</l>
     <l n="35">Than a lubber on shore , that despises a sailor .</l>
     <l n="36">Do they ask me what pleasure I find on the sea ?—</l>
     <l n="37">Why , absence from land is a pleasure to me :</l>
     <l n="38">A hamper of porter , and plenty of grog ,</l>
     <l n="39">A friend , when too sleepy , to give me a jog ,</l>
     <l n="40">A coop that will always some poultry afford ,</l>
     <l n="41">Some bottles of gin , and no parson on board ,</l>
     <l n="42">A crew that is brisk when it happens to blow ,</l>
     <l n="43">One compass on deck and another below ,</l>
     <l n="44">A girl , with more sense than the girl at the head ,</l>
     <l n="45">To read me a novel , or make up my bed —</l>
     <l n="46">The man that has these , has a treasure in store</l>
     <l n="47">That millions possess not , who live upon shore :</l>
     <l n="48">But if it should happen that commerce grew dull ,</l>
     <l n="49">Or Neptune , ill-humoured , should batter our hull ,</l>
     <l n="50">Should damage my cargo , or heave me aground ,</l>
     <l n="51">Or pay me with farthings instead of a pound :</l>
     <l n="52">Should I always be left in the rear of the race ,</l>
     <l n="53">And this be forever — forever the case ;</l>
     <l n="54">Why then , if the honest plain truth I may tell ,</l>
     <l n="55">I would clew up my topsails , and bid him farewell .</l>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 50 ]</span>Published in the National Gazette for January 23 , 1792 , introduced by a short essay upon country taverns . The following is an extract :</p>
   <p>“ Happy would it be for every community if ardent spirits could be banished from amongst them .... I shall conclude these observations with some lines written last winter at a country tavern , where from the introduction of a single jug of rum , conviviality and good humour were changed into madness and brutality , and numbers of the guests , who came , perhaps , only to pass a social hour , went away maimed , muttering , and lastingly embittered against each other . ” The poem appeared in the edition of 1795 with the title “ The Jug of Rum . ” Text from the edition of 1809 .</p>

The poet here refers to the well-known passage in Burke 's Reflections on the Revolution in France , published October , 1790 , in which after describing the queen of France as he had seen her in 1774 and the “ prostrate homage ” which her nation had paid to her at that time , he dwells upon the contrast of 1789 : “ Oh , what a revolution ! and what a heart must I have , to contemplate without emotion that elevation and that fall ! Little did I dream when she added titles of veneration to those of enthusiastic , distant , respectful love , that she should ever be obliged to carry the sharp antidote against disgrace concealed in that bosom ; little did I dream that I should have lived to see such disasters fallen upon her in a nation of gallant men , in a nation of men of honour and of cavaliers . I thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from their scabbards to avenge even a look that threatened her with insult . But the age of chivalry is gone . That of sophisters , oeconomists , and calculators has succeeded ; and the glory of Europe is extinguished forever . ”</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 68 ]</span>This ode was sung at the Civic Feast given to Genet in Philadelphia by the French and Citizens , June 1 , 1793 . The affair is described in detail in Bache 's Aurora of June 4th . After three of the toasts the artillery fired salutes with two twelve pounders , fifteen rounds each . Freneau 's ode was sung after the seventh toast , “ with great effect . ” As to the date of composition of the ode I can find no reliable evidence . Conway , in his life of Paine , mentions that it was sung in 1791 at the November Festival of the London Revolution Society . It was published in the edition of 1795 , but was not reproduced in 1809 .</p>

   <p>Jay 's treaty with England was laid before the Senate in June , 1795 , and after two weeks of fierce discussion was ratified by a very small majority . The Senate , fearing popular criticism , forbade the publication of the treaty , a course which caused such widespread indignation that Mason on his own responsibility gave a perfect copy of the text to the Philadelphia Aurora for publication . The act was as much praised by one party as it was condemned by the other .</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Among a despicable mess of scurrility in one of Porcupine 's Gazettes of last week , he mentions that ‘ he was plagued with the Time-Piece for several months . ’ — It has also been a plague to some others of his brethren , and will go on to be so , till they are hustled into their native dog kennels .— At the commencement of the Time-Piece , by way of soliciting an exchange of papers , the Editor transmitted one copy to each printer of a newspaper in Philadelphia . The compliment was immediately returned by them all except Porcupine . The Editor of the Time-Piece was in no want of his dirty vehicle of ribaldry , for the purposes of compilation . The paper , however , continued to be sent for a few weeks , till finding the hoggishness of the fellow , in not consenting to an exchange , the transmission was discontinued . ”</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 130 ]</span>From the edition of 1815 . The yellow fever epidemic of 1797 created more than usual consternation . It was supposed to be of a more deadly type than that of 1793 . The medical profession was divided as to the treatment of the disease . “ Two hostile schools sprang up . At the head of one was William Currie . Benjamin Rush led the other . The Currie men declared the fever was imported and contagious . The Rush school maintained that it was not . Filthy streets , they held , and loathsome alleys had much to do with the sickness , and they urged the use of mercurial purges and the copious letting of blood . ” — McMaster .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 131 ]</span>These odes first appeared in the Time-Piece , where they were published in rapid succession between October 16 and November 13 , 1797 . Three of them — the fourth , sixth , and eleventh — were republished , greatly revised , in the edition of 1809 . The eighth , tenth , and thirteenth were used in revised form in the 1815 edition . The others are here republished for the first time .</p>
   <p>The first ode , which is manifestly an adaptation of Dr. Watts ’ well-known hymn , seems to have been objected to in some quarters , for in the Time-Piece for December 22 appeared the following :</p>
   <p>“ Some serious animadversions appear in the Connecticut Courant on the first number of the Book of Odes , published in the Time-Piece of the 14th ult . being a profane parody , as the writer insinuates , on the first Psalm of David — where the aristocrat corresponds with the saint in the psalm , and the democrat with the impenitent sinner . These gentlemen writers ought to consider that the parody in question ( as they choose to call it ) was not meant to be sung through a deacon 's nose , to the sound of the organ : nor yet to the timbrel of seven strings : it was merely intended to be harped upon out of doors , for the benefit of all good democrats , and the utter astoundment and confusion of the contrary character . In the name of common sense how did the printers of the Connecticut Courant dare to act so irreverantly as to place the parody before the psalm ? Are they trampling on all sanctity ; or what do they mean ? Let them beware — serious times are coming on , gentlemen :</p>

In the 1815 edition the title is “ The Heroine of the Revolution . To the men in power , ” with the note “ On December 23 , 1797 , Deborah Gannet presented a petition to congress for a pension , in consideration of services rendered during the whole of the American Revolutionary war , in the rank of a common soldier in the regular armies of the United States . The above lines were written on this occasion , at the request of the heroine . It is needless to say , she had a competency bestowed on her during her natural life . ” Freneau 's daughter has thus recounted the circumstances under which the affair became known to the poet :</p>
   <p>“ While editor of the Time-Piece his office was thronged with visitors mostly wanting favors of one kind or another . One day he came into dinner and told Mrs. Freneau that there had been rather an eccentric character in the office that morning , telling him that she had served through the Revolutionary War in man 's attire and had received several wounds and showed the scars . All he could do for her was to send her to Washington with a petition , which he did . Her name was Deborah Gannet . She went to Congress , presented her petition , and received her pension . Though he put not his name to it , it was immediately known , as many of the members were his correspondents , also Thomas Jefferson , the President . ”</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 144 ]</span>From the 1815 edition . A young Englishman , Thomas Twining , who visited Washington in 1796 , describes it as follows : “ Having crossed an extensive tract of level country somewhat resembling an English heath , I entered a large wood through which a very imperfect road had been made , principally by removing the trees or the upper parts of them in the usual manner . After some time this indistinct way assumed more the appearance of a regular avenue , the trees having been cut down in a straight line although no habitation of any kind was visible . I had no doubt but I was now riding along one of the streets of the metropolitan city . I continued in this spacious avenue for half a mile and then came out upon a large spot cleared of wood , in the center of which I saw two unfinished buildings and men at work on one of them . Advancing and speaking to these workmen , they informed me that I was in the center of the city and that the building was the Capitol . Looking from where I stood I saw on every side a thick wood pierced with avenues in a more or less perfect state . ”</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 153 ]</span>This period comprises the time between the poet 's abandonment of the Time-Piece in New York in 1798 , and his final farewell to the sea , which was , in reality , in 1807 . During this time Freneau lived in retirement at Mount Pleasant , making now and then voyages along the southern coast and to the Madeira Islands . The poems of the period dwell largely on the dangers of monarchy . He became more and more philosophical as he grew older . He delighted in his leisure hours to translate from the old Latin writers , and to make moralizing verses of a somewhat tedious nature . I have omitted all of the translations of this period and most of the moralizings .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 154 ]</span>Freneau sailed as passenger to Charleston , January 3 , 1798 , and arrived on February 3 , after a rough voyage . He sailed back from Charleston in the ship Maria , March 7 , arriving in New York one week later . Text from the 1815 edition .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 156 ]</span>Text from the 1815 edition . During the early part of the year 1798 America was full of rumors of a French invasion . Talleyrand was scattering obscure hints that an invading army was preparing ; that France well knew that America was divided ; that only the Federalists would support the administration . The Federalists , supported by President Adams and by Washington , took active measures at once . In July they formally abrogated the treaty between the two countries and authorized the President to grant letters to shipmen empowering them to seize French vessels . The army was put into readiness , and financial legislation was enacted to procure means for carrying on the war . All believed that war with France was inevitable .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 177 ]</span>The text is from the edition of 1815 . The interior of Nassau Hall was destroyed by fire March 6 , 1802 . The damage was promptly repaired by generous contributions from the alumni and friends of the institution . President Smith took an active part in the work of rebuilding and it was in no small measure due to his efforts that the edifice was so quickly restored .</p>
   <p>Nassau Hall , the oldest and because of its historical associations the most interesting of the Princeton buildings , was erected in 1756 from plans drawn by Robert Smith and Dr. Shippen of Philadelphia . It was for many years the handsomest and most commodious academic structure in the colonies and as such attracted no little attention . During the Revolution it served repeatedly as barracks and hospital for both armies and suffered considerable damage . From the 26th of June until the 4th of November , 1783 , it was the national capitol . Within its walls the Congress of the nation found a safe retreat and for more than four months held quiet session in the spacious library-room remote from the mutinous troops at Philadelphia . Here the Minister from the States General of Holland , the first ambassador accredited to America after the declaration of peace was received , and here the grateful acknowledgments of Congress were tendered Washington for his services in establishing the freedom and independence of the United States .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 182 ]</span>From the edition of 1815 . Freneau sailed from Charleston January 25 , 1804 , and on March 7 he arrived at Madeira . On April 15 he was at Santa Cruz , and on May 11 he sailed for home .</p>
   <p>GENERAL NOTE .</p>
   <p>From the best accounts that could be procured at Madeira , there perished in and near the city of Funchal , five hundred and fifty persons . The ravages were chiefly confined to the eastern parts of the town where the loss was immense in bridges , houses , streets and other property , public as well as private — there was one magnificent church totally destroyed , standing near the sea , and called in the portuguese tongue , Nossa Senyora da Caillou ( lady of the beach ) besides this , there were five handsome chapels carried away . Five very considerable streets with their immense stone buildings have entirely disappeared , or but some insignificant parts remaining . The water rose in a short space of time from 14 to 16 feet in the adjacent parts of the city , and bursting into the buildings , where it did not much injure the latter , it greatly damaged the merchantile property lodged therein . There were about two hundred persons supposed to be lost in other parts of the island , particularly in the villages , and small towns . The following circumstance it was asserted , added not a little to the devastations occasioned by the accumulation of water in the vallies . The governor , with several other considerable landholders in the mountains , had , for several years back , been in the practice of erecting stone dams across the vast and spacious valley above the city , at different intervals of distance for the purpose of watering the adjacent grounds , or leading off streams in a variety of directions — when the immense body of rain fell in October last , all this gave way , and carried death and destruction therewith .— Freneau 's note .</p>

O Fanny ! these envenom 'd states Have doom 'd our deaths among the rats , In one explosion , to the sky Our chaplain , rats , and sailors fly . “ To deal in such inhuman war Is more than English blood can bear ; It brings again the gothic age , Renews that period on the stage , When men against the gods rebell 'd , And Ossa was on Pelion piled : The trojan war , when Diomede In battle , made fair Venus bleed ; Or , when the giants of renown Attempted Jove 's imperial crown :— From such a foe , before we meet , The safest way , is to retreat , To leave this curst unlucky shore And come to trouble them no more . “ But , should it be my fate to-night Not to behold to-morrow 's light But mingle with the vulgar dead , With all my terrors on my head — Should such a fate be mine , I say , Dear Fanny , you must lead the way ;— You are the saint that will atone For what amiss I might have done : If such as you will intercede The chaplain may a furlow plead , While you and I in raptures go Where stormy winds no longer blow , Where guns are not , to shed our blood , Or if there be , are made of wood ; Where all is love , and no one hates ; No falling kings or rising states ; No colors that we must defend , If sick , or dead , or near our end ; Where yankees are admitted not To hatch their damn 'd torpedo plot : Where you will have no beds to make , Nor I be doom 'd to lie awake . ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 201 ]</span>It is a fact well ascertained that during a great part of the summer of 1814 the knight was under such serious apprehensions of being blown up by the Torpedo men , that he enjoyed no sleep or rest for many nights together . With such feelings , and under such impressions , he is supposed to begin his soliloquy abruptly , under all the emotions of horror , incident to such an occasion .— Freneau 's note . Sir Thomas Hardy was commander of the 74 gun ship Ramillies , the leader of the squadron which lay off New London during the summer of 1814 . The following in Niles ’ Register , May 7 , 1814 , is suggestive : “ It appears the British squadron off New London are yet disturbed by torpedoes . One of them lately exploded under the sprit-sail yard of the La Hoque , and threw up a volume of water near her fore top .

Haste away from town and farm : If we meet them , where 's the harm ? English power has lost its charm , England 's fame is tumbling down . Long she ruled the northern waste , Freedom is by her debased , Freedom is not to her taste ; All the world must wear her chain !!! “ Not a keel shall plough the wave , Not a sail , without her leave ; Not a fleet , the nations have , Safe from her , shall stem the main !!! Let this day 's heroic deeds Let the generous breast that bleeds , Let our chief who bravely leads Tell them that their reign is done : Soon to quit Columbia 's shore , Is their doom — we say no more ; General Brown , in the cannon 's roar Tells them how the field is won !<span type="note_anchor">[ 202 ]</span>Early in the year 1814 the British army obtained possession of Fort Niagara and thereupon determined to remove the seat of the war to the Niagara frontier . The American expedition intended to invade Canada was directed , under command of General Jacob Brown , to dislodge the British from this position . The first decisive action was the battle of Chippewa , fought July 5 , 1814 , on Canadian soil , opposite Niagara Falls . Three weeks later , July 25 , he again closed with the British at Bridgewater , or Lundy Lane , in the same vicinity . In both engagements the Americans were victorious . ON POLITICAL SERMONS When parsons preach on politics , pray why Should declamation cease , if you go by ? We heard a lecture , or a scold , And , doubtful which it might be call 'd , But senseless as the bell that toll 'd , And pleasing neither young nor old . We kept our seats amid the din , Then quit the field , with all our sin , Just as good as we went in . Tell me what the preacher said , Ye , who somewhat longer stay 'd Till the last address was made :— Why ,— he talk 'd of ruin 'd states , Demagogues and democrates , Falling stars , and Satan 's baits . Did he mention nothing more ?— Simply , what he said before — Repetitions , twenty score . His arguments could nothing prove , His text alarm 'd the sacred grove , His prayer displeased the powers above . He would not pray for those who rule , But hoped that in Bethesda 's pool They all might dip , to make them cool . He deprecated blood and war , Its many mischiefs did deplore Except when England mounts the car . At Congress he had such a fling , As plainly show 'd , he wish 'd a king , Might here arrive , on Vulture 's wing ; And that himself an horn might blow To shake our modern Jericho , And bring its ramparts very low . To english notes his psalm was sung , With politics the pulpit rung , And thrice was bellow 'd from his tongue , “ The president is always wrong ! “ He brought these evils on our land , And he must go — the time 's at hand — With Bonaparte to take his stand . ” — Must not the wheels of fate go on ? Must not the lion 's teeth be drawn , Because it suits not Prester John !— A Bishop 's Lawn is such a prize Such virtue in a mitre lies , Democracy before it flies . And these he hopes , if George prevails , In time may hoist his shorten 'd sails And waft him on , with fortune 's gales . To gain by preaching , nett and clear , Some twenty hundred pounds a year ; Which democrats would never bear . To England why so much a friend , Or why her cause with heat defend ?— There is , no doubt , some selfish end . Dear Momus come , and help me laugh — This England is the stay and staff Of true religion — more than half ! She is the prop of all that 's good , A bulwark , which for ages stood To guard the path and mark the road ! One proof of which can soon be brought , The temple rais 'd to Jaggernaut , [ A ] And India to his temple brought , [ A ] The temple of Jaggernaut , an idolatrous establishment in India , to the support of which the english government contributed largely . The unwieldy idol , to which the temple is dedicated , is , on certain days , carried about the streets on a huge carriage , under the wheels of which the superstitious multitude , it is said , suffer themselves to be trampled and crushed to pieces , by hundreds , from a superstitious motive . If this be not fiction , may the british government exert its influence to eradicate so barbarous and bloody a superstition from the minds of millions of idolatrous wretches .— Freneau 's note . To see her murder 'd , mangled sons , To worship idols , stocks , and stones , Or reliques of some scoundrel 's bones . And “ long may heaven on England smile — ( So says our preacher , all the while ) The world 's last hope , fast anchor 'd isle ! ” — Religion there is made no sport , State tailors there have deckt her out In a birth-day suit — to go to court !— LINES ON NAPOLEON BONAPARTE<span type="note_anchor">[ 203 ]</span>Napoleon , born for regal sway , With fortune in a smiling mood , To a foreign land explored his way , Where Cairo stands , or Memphis stood . And still he fought , and still she smiled , And urged him far , and spurr 'd him on , And on his march , at length beguiled , One thinking man to wear a crown . The crown attracted many a care , And war employ 'd him , day and night ; He by a princess had an heir Born to succeed him , or — who might . Through russian tribes he forced his way , To blast their hopes and hurl them down Whose valor might dispute his sway , Or dispossess him of a crown . At last arrived the fatal time , When powerful tyrants , jealous grown , Agreed to count it for a crime A commoner should fill a throne . European states , with England join 'd To keep unmixt the royal race , And let the famed Napoleon find A dotard might supply his place .<span type="note_anchor">[ 203 ]</span>This poem and the one following were written shortly after the news of Napoleon 's banishment to Elba , April 11 , 1814 , had reached America . ON THE DISMISSION OF BONAPARTE From the French Throne . Famed Bonaparte , in regal pride , Put slighted Josephine aside , And wedded an imperial bride , Of fortune sure . But when he droop 'd , and when he fell , ( I took my pen and mark 'd it well ) This jilt of jilts , this austrian belle , No longer styled him , Mon Amour ; Which means , I think , my dearest heart , My love !— but lovers often part When friendship does not point the dart , Nor fix the flame . And warning , hence , let others take , Nor love 's decree for interest break ; In marriage , too much lies at stake To slight its claim . Retreating to the tuscan coast , An empire , wife , and fortune lost , He found the throne a dangerous post , And wars a cheat ; Where all , who play their game too deep , Must hazard life , and discord reap , Or thrown from grandeur 's giddy steep , Lament their fate . Napoleon , with an empty chest ! An austrian princess must detest ; And yet , she wears upon her breast The painted toy ; [ A ] [ A ] A miniature picture of the late emperor Napoleon .— Freneau 's note . And often weeps , the story goes , That royal blood not wholly flows In every vein , from head to toes , Of her dear boy . To Elba 's isle she could not go — The royal orders said “ No , no ! On Elba 's island we bestow No royal throne : ” And thus Napoleon , shoved from power , Has many a lonely gloomy hour To walk on Elba 's sea-beat shore , Alone ! alone ! O save us from ambition 's sway , Ye powers , who tread the milky way ; It will deceive , it will betray Nine out of ten . Napoleon 's history let us read : In science he was great indeed — Ambition 's lantern did mislead This prince of men :— And yet , ambition had its use , It check 'd the royal game of goose , And many a flagrant vile abuse Fell at his frown . But , doom 'd to share immortal fame , Despotic powers will dread his name , Though he , perhaps , was much the same , Raised to a throne ! THE PRINCE REGENT 'S RESOLVE The regent prince , enraged to find The standard from his frigates torn , To a full court thus spoke his mind , With hand display 'd and soul of scorn , “ Since fate decreed Napoleon 's fall , Now , now 's the time to conquer all ! “ We at the head of all that 's great , Tis ours to hold the world in awe : Let Louis reign in regal state , And let his subjects own his law ; Their tide of power tis ours to stem — We 'll govern those who govern them . “ But here 's the rub , and here 's my grief ; My frigates from the seas are hurl 'd ! What shall we do ? how find relief ? How strike and stupefy the world ? Our flag , that long control 'd the main , Our standard must be raised again . “ A land there lies towards the west There must my royal will be done ; That land is an infernal nest Of reptiles , rul 'd by Madison : That nest I swear to humble down , There plant a king , and there a crown . “ Depart , my fleet , depart , my slaves , Invade that nest , attack and burn ; Where'er the ocean rolls his waves , Subdue , or dare not to return ; Subdue and plunder all you can , Who plunders most — shall be my man . “ To scatter death , by fire and sword , To prostrate all , where'er you go : That is the mandate , that the word , Though seas of blood around you flow : No more !— go , aid the indian yell : Be conquerors , and I 'll feed you well . So spoke the prince , but little knew His minions were for slaughter fed ; Nor did he guess , that vengeance , too , Would fall on his devoted head ; When all his plans and projects fail , And he ascends Belshazzar 's scale .

[ A ] This little ode , with the addition of two new stanzas is somewhat altered from one of Robert Burns ’ compositions , and applied to an american occasion : the original being Bruce 's supposed address to his army , a little before the battle of Bannockbourne .— Freneau 's note . Ye , whom Washington has led , Ye , who in his footsteps tread , Ye , who death nor danger dread , Haste to glorious victory . Now 's the day and now 's the hour ; See the British navy lour , See approach proud George 's power , England ! chains and slavery . Who would be a traitor knave ? Who would fill a coward 's grave ? Who so base to be a slave ? Traitor , coward , turn and flee . Meet the tyrants , one and all ; Freemen stand , or freemen fall — At Columbia 's patriot call , At her mandate , march away ! Former times have seen them yield , Seen them drove from every field , Routed , ruin 'd , and repell 'd — Seize the spirit of those times ! By oppression 's woes and pains — By our sons in servile chains We will bleed from all our veins But they shall be — shall be free . O'er the standard of their power Bid Columbia 's eagle tower , Give them hail in such a shower As shall blast them — horse and man ! Lay the proud invaders low , Tyrants fall in every foe ; Liberty 's in every blow , Forward ! let us do or die . THE BATTLE OF STONINGTON ON THE SEABOARD OF CONNECTICUT In an attack upon the town and a small fort of two guns , by the Ramillies , seventy-four gun ship , commanded by Sir Thomas Hardy ; the Pactolus , 38 gun ship , Despatch , brig of 22 guns , and a razee , or bomb ship .— August , 1814 . Four gallant ships from England came Freighted deep with fire and flame , And other things we need not name , To have a dash at Stonington . Now safely moor 'd , their work begun ; They thought to make the yankees run , And have a mighty deal of fun In stealing sheep at Stonington . A deacon , then popp 'd up his head And parson Jones 's sermon read , In which the reverend doctor said That they must fight for Stonington . A townsman bade them , next , attend To sundry resolutions penn 'd , By which they promised to defend With sword and gun , old Stonington . The ships advancing different ways , The britons soon began to blaze , And put th ’ old women in amaze , Who fear 'd the loss of Stonington . The yankees to their fort repair 'd , And made as though they little cared For all that came — though very hard The cannon play 'd on Stonington . The Ramillies began the attack , Despatch came forward — bold and black — And none can tell what kept them back From setting fire to Stonington . The bombardiers with bomb and ball , Soon made a farmer 's barrack fall , And did a cow-house sadly maul That stood a mile from Stonington . They kill 'd a goose , they kill 'd a hen , Three hogs they wounded in a pen — They dash 'd away , and pray what then ? This was not taking Stonington . The shells were thrown , the rockets flew , But not a shell , of all they threw , Though every house was full in view , Could burn a house at Stonington . To have their turn they thought but fair ;— The yankees brought two guns to bear , And , sir , it would have made you stare , This smoke of smokes at Stonington . They bored Pactolus through and through , And kill 'd and wounded of her crew So many , that she bade adieu T ’ the gallant boys of Stonington . The brig Despatch was hull 'd and torn — So crippled , riddled , so forlorn , No more she cast an eye of scorn On th ’ little fort at Stonington . The Ramillies gave up th ’ affray And , with her comrades , sneak 'd away — Such was the valor , on that day , Of british tars near Stonington . But some assert , on certain grounds , ( Besides the damage and the wounds ) It cost the king ten thousand pounds To have a dash at Stonington .

A curse on England 's frantic schemes ! Both mad and blind — her monarch dreams Of crowns and kingdoms in these climes Where kings have had their sentence . Though Washington has left our coast , Yet other Washingtons we boast , Who rise , instructed by his ghost , To punish all invaders . Go where they will , where'er they land , This pilfering , plundering , pirate band , They liberty will find at hand To hurl them to perdition : If in Virginia they appear , Their fate is fix 'd , their doom is near , Death in their front and hell their rear — So says the gallant buckskin . All Carolina is prepared , And Charleston doubly on her guard ; Where , once , sir Peter badly fared , So blasted by fort Moultrie .

ON THE ENGLISH DEVASTATIONS AT THE CITY OF WASHINGTON<span type="note_anchor">[ 205 ]</span>Their power abused ! that power may soon descend : Years , not remote , may see their glory end :— The british power , the avaricious crown , Pull 'd every flag , hurl 'd every standard down ; Columbian ships they seized on every sea , Condemn 'd those ships , nor left our sailors free .— So long a tyrant on the watery stage , They thought to tyrannize through every age ; They hoped all commerce to monopolize ; Europe , at sea , they affected to despise ; They laugh 'd at France contending for a share Of commerce , one would think , as free as air . They captured most , without remorse or plea , And grew as proud as arrogance could be . Stung by a thousand wrongs , at length arose The Western States , these tyrants to oppose ; With just resentment , met them on the main , And burnt , or sunk their ships , with hosts of slain . The blood ran black from every english heart To see their empire from the seas depart , To see their flag to thirteen stripes surrender , And many an english ship made fire and tinder ; They swore , they raged ; they saw , with patience spent , Each last engagement had the same event — What could they do ? revenge inspired their breasts , And hell 's sensations seized their swelling chests .— All to revenge , to Maryland they came , And costly works of art assail 'd with flame ; In Washington they left a dismal void ,— Poor compensation for their ships destroy 'd !— We burn , where guns their frigates poorly guard ; They burn , where scarce a gun is seen or heard !<span type="note_anchor">[ 205 ]</span>Washington was taken by the British , August 24 , 1814 . “ It was only the vandalism of the British soldiers and sailors , incited by Cockburn and ill restrained by Ross , that made this incursion at once memorable and infamous . To public edifices , having no immediate relation to the war , the torch was applied ; to the unfinished Capitol ( which contained the library of Congress ) ; the President 's house , the Treasury ,— to all the government buildings in fact , except the Patent Office , besides numerous private dwellings about Capitol Hill . ” — Schouler 's History of the United States . “ All this was the more shameful because done under strict orders from home . ” — Green 's History of the English People . ON THE CONFLAGRATIONS AT WASHINGTON August 24 , 1814 —— Jam deiphobi dedit ampla ruinam , Vulcano superante , domus ; jam proximus ardet Ucalegon .— Virgil . Now , George the third rules not alone , For George the vandal shares the throne , True flesh of flesh and bone of bone . God save us from the fangs of both ; Or , one a vandal , one a goth , May roast or boil us into froth . Like danes , of old , their fleet they man And rove from Beersheba to Dan , To burn , and beard us — where they can . They say , at George the fourth 's command This vagrant host were sent , to land And leave in every house — a brand . An idiot only would require Such war — the worst they could desire — The felon 's war — the war of fire . The warfare , now , th ’ invaders make Must surely keep us all awake , Or life is lost for freedom 's sake . They said to Cockburn , “ honest Cock ! To make a noise and give a shock Push off , and burn their navy dock : “ Their capitol shall be emblazed ! How will the buckskins stand amazed , And curse the day its walls were raised ! ” Six thousand heroes disembark — Each left at night his floating ark And Washington was made their mark . That few would fight them — few or none — Was by their leaders clearly shown — And “ down , ” they said , “ with Madison ! ” How close they crept along the shore ! As closely as if Rodgers saw her — A frigate to a seventy-four . A veteran host , by veterans led , With Ross and Cockburn at their head — They came — they saw — they burnt — and fled . But not unpunish 'd they retired ; They something paid , for all they fired , In soldiers kill 'd , and chiefs expired . Five hundred veterans bit the dust , Who came , inflamed with lucre 's lust — And so they waste — and so they must . They left our congress naked walls — Farewell to towers and capitols ! To lofty roofs and splendid halls ! To courtly domes and glittering things , To folly , that too near us clings , To courtiers who — tis well — had wings . Farewell to all but glorious war , Which yet shall guard Potomac 's shore , And honor lost , and fame restore . To conquer armies in the field Was , once , the surest method held To make a hostile country yield . The mode is this , now acted on ; In conflagrating Washington , They held our independence gone ! Supposing George 's house at Kew Were burnt , ( as we intend to do ,) Would that be burning England too ? Supposing , near the silver Thames We laid in ashes their saint James , Or Blenheim palace wrapt in flames ; Made Hampton Court to fire a prey , And meanly , then , to sneak away , And never ask them , what 's to pay ? Would that be conquering London town ? Would that subvert the english throne , Or bring the royal system down ? With all their glare of guards or guns , How would they look like simpletons , And not at all the lion 's sons ! Supposing , then , we take our turn And make it public law , to burn , Would not old english honor spurn At such a mean insidious plan Which only suits some savage clan — And surely not — the english man ! A doctrine has prevail 'd too long ; A king , they hold , can do no wrong — Merely a pitch-fork , without prong : But de'il may trust such doctrines , more ,— One king , that wrong 'd us , long before , Has wrongs , by hundreds , yet in store . He wrong 'd us forty years ago ; He wrongs us yet , we surely know ; He 'll wrong us till he gets a blow That , with a vengeance , will repay The mischiefs we lament this day , This burning , damn 'd , infernal play ; Will send one city to the sky , Its buildings low and buildings high , And buildings — built the lord knows why ; Will give him an eternal check That breaks his heart or breaks his neck , And plants our standard on Quebec .</note>

THE BATTLE OF LAKE CHAMPLAIN September 11 , 1814 Between the british squadron , of 93 guns and 1050 men , and the American fleet of 86 guns and 820 men . The Confiance , of 39 and the Saratoga , of 26 guns , were the flag ships of the two commanders , Downie and Macdonough . Parading near saint Peter 's flood Full fourteen thousand soldiers stood ; Allied with natives of the wood , With frigates , sloops , and galleys near ; Which southward , now , began to steer ; Their object was , Ticonderogue . Assembled at Missisqui bay A feast they held , to hail the day , When all should bend to british sway From Plattsburg to Ticonderogue . And who could tell , if reaching there They might not other laurels share And England 's flag in triumph bear To the capitol , at Albany !!! Sir George advanced , with fire and sword , The frigates were with vengeance stored , The strength of Mars was felt on board ,— When Downie gave the dreadful word , Huzza ! for death or victory ! Sir George beheld the prize at stake , And , with his veterans , made the attack , Macomb 's brave legions drove him back ; And England 's fleet approach 'd to meet A desperate combat , on the lake . With sulphurous clouds the heavens were black ; We saw advance the Confiance , Shall blood and carnage mark her track , To gain dominion on the lake . Then on our ships she pour 'd her flame , And many a tar did kill or maim , Who suffer 'd for their country 's fame , Her soil to save , her rights to guard . Macdonough , now , began his play , And soon his seamen heard him say , No Saratoga yields , this day , To all the force that Britain sends . “ Disperse , my lads , and man the waist , Be firm , and to your stations haste , And England from Champlain is chased , If you behave as you 'll see me . ” The fire began with awful roar ; At our first flash the artillery tore From his proud stand , their commodore , A presage of the victory . The skies were hid in flame and smoke , Such thunders from the cannon spoke , The contest such an aspect took As if all nature went to wreck ! From isle La Motte to Saranac [ A ] [ A ] A river which rises from several small lakes among the mountains to the westward of Lake Champlain , and after a north easterly course of near seventy-five miles , enters the grand lake in the vicinity of Plattsburg .— Freneau 's note . Amidst his decks , with slaughter strew 'd , Unmoved , the brave Macdonough stood , Or waded through a scene of blood , At every step that round him stream 'd : He stood amidst Columbia 's sons , He stood amidst dismounted guns , He fought amidst heart-rending groans , The tatter 'd sail , the tottering mast . Then , round about , his ship he wore , And charged his guns with vengeance sore , And more than Etna shook the shore — The foe confess 'd the contest vain . In vain they fought , in vain they sail 'd , That day ; for Britain 's fortune fail 'd , And their best efforts nought avail 'd To hold dominion on Champlain . So , down their colors to the deck The vanquish 'd struck — their ships a wreck — What dismal tidings for Quebec , What news for England and her prince ! For , in this fleet , from England won , A favorite project is undone : Her sorrows only are begun — And she may want , and very soon , Her armies for her own defence . A DIALOGUE AT WASHINGTON 'S TOMB Genius of Virginia — and — Virginia . Genius .

Or the sons of those of old Cast in nature 's rudest mould ,— Dear Virginia , can it be ? What a stain is laid on thee ! Virginia .

Dear Virginia ! tell me how ?— Tell me not , or tell me now , Can you wield the bolts of Jove , Seize the lightnings from above ? Tear the mountain from its base To confound this hated race , Who , with hostile step , presume To violate the honor 'd tomb Of my bravest , noblest son , Of th ’ immortal Washington ! Virginia . Not the artillery of the sky , Not the vengeance from on high Did I want , to guard my son , I have lightnings of my own ! But I wanted —— Genius . —— Wanted what ? Tell me now , or tell me not .

Genius . By the powers that guard this spot , Want them longer you shall not , I , the patron of your land , From this moment take command , Kindle flames in every breast , Thirst of vengeance for the past ; Vengeance , that from shore to shore Shall dye your bay with english gore , And see them leave their thousands slain , If they dare to land again : This is all I choose to say — Seize your armour — let 's away ! SIR PETER PETRIFIED On the Modern Sir Peter Parker 's<span type="note_anchor">[ 207 ]</span>Expedition to Kent Island in Chesapeake Bay . — 1814 — Sir Peter came , with bold intent , To persecute the men of Kent His flag aloft display 'd : He came to see their pleasant farms , But ventured not without his arms To talk with man or maid . And then the gallant colonel Reed Said , “ we must see the man indeed ; He comes perhaps in want — Who knows but that his stores are out : Tis hard to dine on mere sour krout , His water may be scant . ” He spoke — but soon the men of Kent Discover 'd what the errand meant , And some , discouraged , said , “ Sir Peter comes to petrify , He points his guns , his colors fly , His men for war array 'd ! ” Secure , as if they own 'd the land , Advanced this daring naval band , As if in days of peace ; Along the shore they , prowling , went , And often ask 'd some friends in Kent Where dwelt the fattest geese ? The farmers ’ geese were doom 'd to bleed ; But some there were , with colonel Reed , Who would not yield assent ; And said , before the geese they take , Sir Peter must a bargain make With us , the boys of Kent . The Britons march 'd along the shore , Two hundred men , or somewhat more ; Next , through the woods they stray 'd : The geese , still watchful , as they went , To save the capitol of Kent Their every step betray 'd . The british march 'd with loaded gun To seize the geese that gabbling run About the isle of Kent : But , what could hardly be believed , Sir Peter was of life bereaved Before he pitch 'd his tent . Some kentish lad , to save the geese , And make their noisy gabbling cease Had took a deadly aim : By kentish hands sir Peter fell , His men retreated , with a yell And lost both geese and game ! Now what I say , I say with grief , That such a knight , or such a chief On such an errand died !!! When men of worth their lives expose For little things , where little grows They make the very geese their foes ; The geese his fall deride : And , sure , they laugh , if laugh they can , To see a star and garter 'd man For life of goose expose his own , And bite the dust , with many a groan — Alas ! a gander cry 'd — “ Behold , ( said he ,) a man of fame Who all the way from England came No more than just to get the name Of Peter Petrified ! ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 207 ]</span>Sir Peter Parker , commander of the British Frigate Menelaus , was prominent for a month in the blockading squadron in Chesapeake Bay during the summer of 1814 . After the burning of Washington he was ordered down the bay “ but Sir Peter said he ‘ must have a frolic with the yankees before he left them ’ and on the 30th of August after dancing and drinking they proceeded to the sport and made a circuitous route to surprise Col. Read encamped in Moore 's fields not far from Georgetown X Roads on the eastern shore of Maryland . The Colonel was fully apprised of their proceedings .... The ground was obstinately contended for nearly an hour when the enemy retreated leaving thirteen killed and three wounded on the field . It is ascertained that they carried off seventeen others among whom was Sir Peter who , with several others , are since dead . ” — Niles ’ Register .

Give them the shadow of the cypress bough !

To kindle up your torch , ambition 's flame Heroic chief , had all its flames supplied ; A monarch 's smiles , a never-dying name , The historian 's subject , and the soldier 's pride ; Your native land with splendid trophies hung ; Joy sparkling in the eye , and praise from every tongue . Deceived how much ! a name alone remains , Not yet complete in fame , nor ripe in years ;— What is the applause such thirst of glory gains , Which not the grave regards or valor hears : In war 's wild tumult , for a name he died , He fell , the victim of a monarch 's pride . A country 's rights , or freedom to defend May sooth the anguish of a dying hour , A ravaged land to succor or befriend , To brave the efforts of a tyrant 's power : These may console , when mad ambition 's train Fade from the view , or sooth the soul in vain .<span type="note_anchor">[ 208 ]</span>General Robert Ross , who with Sir George Cockburn had burned Washington , was killed at North Point , Md ., Sept. 12 , 1814 .

The scenes to be acted were not very new , And when they approach 'd , with their rat-tat-too , As merry as times would allow , We ran up the colors to liberty true , And gave them a shot , with a tow-row-dow . By land and by water how many have fail 'd In attacking an enemy 's town , But britons they tell us , have always prevail 'd Wherever they march 'd , or wherever they sail 'd , To honor his majesty 's sceptre and crown : Wherever they went , with the trumpet and drum , And the dregs of the world , and the dirt , and the scum , As soon as the music begun , The colors were struck , and surrender 'd the town When the summons was given of down , down , down ! But fortune , so fickle , is turning her tide , And safe is old Baltimore town , Though Cockburn and Cochrane , with Ross at their side , The sons of Columbia despised and defy 'd , And determined to batter it down ; Rebuff 'd and repulsed in disgrace they withdrew , With their down , down , down , and their rat-tat-too , As well as the times would allow : And the sight , we expect , will be not very new When they meet us again , with our tow-row-dow .<span type="note_anchor">[ 209 ]</span>After the burning of Washington the British fleet and army concentrated upon Baltimore .

The real aboriginal name of this remarkable promontory was Navesink , since corrupted into Neversink .— Freneau 's note . Where from the deep his head he rears The din of war salutes his ears , That teazed him not for thirty years . He eastward looks toward the main To see a noisy naval train Invest his bay , our fleets detain . What can be done in such a case ?— His rugged heights the blast must face , The storm that menaces the place . With tents I see his mountain spread , The soldier to the summit led , And cannon planted on his head : From Shrewsbury beach to Sandy Hook The country has a martial look , And quakers skulk in every nook .— What shall be done in such a case ?— We ask again with woful face To save the trade and guard the place ? Where mounted guns the porte secure , The cannon at the embrasure , Will british fleets attempt to moor ? Perhaps they may — and make a dash , To fill their pockets with our cash — Their dealings now are rather harsh . They menace to assail the coast With such a fleet and such a host As may devour us — boil 'd or roast . Their feelings are alive and sore For what they got at Baltimore , When , with disgrace , they left the shore , And will revenge it , if they can , On town and country , maid and man — And all they fear is Fulton 's plan ; Torpedoes planted in the deep , Whose blast may put them all to sleep , Or ghostify them at a sweep . Another scheme , entirely new , Is hammering on his anvil too , That frightens christian , turk , and jew .

To make a brief of all I said — If to attack they change blockade Their godships will be well repaid With water , scalding from the pot , With melted lead and flaming shot , With vollies of — I know not what , The british lads will be so treated : Their wooden walls will be so heated , Their ruin will be soon completed . Our citizens shall stare and wonder — The Neversink repel their thunder And Cockburn miss a handsome plunder . ROYAL CONSULTATIONS Relative to the Disposal of Lord Wellington 's Army Said the goth to the vandal , the prince to the king , Let us do a mad action , to make the world ring : With Wellington 's army we now have the means To make a bold stroke and exhibit new scenes . A stroke at the states is my ardent desire , To waste , and harass them with famine and fire ; My vengeance to carry through village and town , And even to batter their capitol down . The vandal then answer 'd , and said to the goth , Dear George , with yourself I am equally wroth : Of Wellington 's army dispose as you please , It is best , I presume , they should go beyond seas ; For , should they come home , I can easily show The hangman will have too much duty to do . So , away came the bruisers , and when they came here Some mischief they did , where no army was near : They came to correct , and they came to chastise And to do all the evil their heads could devise . At Washington city , they burnt and destroy 'd Till among the big houses they made a huge void ; Then back to their shipping they flew like the wind , But left many more than five hundred behind Of wounded and dead , and others say , double ; And thus was the hangman excused from some trouble . Alexandria beheld them in battle array ; Alexandria they plunder 'd a night and a day . Then quickly retreated , with moderate loss , Their forces conducted by Cockburn and Ross . At Baltimore , next , was their place of attack ; But Baltimore drove them repeatedly back ; There Rodgers they saw , and their terror was such , They saw they were damn 'd when they saw him approach . The forts were assail 'd by the strength of their fleet , And the forts , in disorder beheld them retreat So shatter 'd and crippled , so mangled and sore , That the tide of Patapsco was red with their gore . Their legions by land no better succeeded — In vain they manoeuvered , in vain they paraded , Their hundreds on hundreds were strew 'd on the ground , Each shot from the rifles brought death or a wound . One shot from a buckskin completed their loss , And their legions no longer were headed by Ross ! Where they mean to go next , we can hardly devise , But home they would go if their master was wise . Yet folly so long has directed their course ; Such madness is seen in the waste of their force , Such weakness and folly , with malice combined , Such rancor , revenge , and derangement of mind , That , all things consider 'd , with truth we may say , Both Cochrane and Cockburn are running away . [ A ] [ A ] About this time , September , 1814 , the admirals Cochrane and Cockburn quitted the coast of the United States in their respective flag ships .— Freneau 's note . To their regent , the prince , to their master the king They are now on the way , they are now on the wing , To tell them the story of loss and disaster , One begging a pension , the other a plaister . Let them speed as they may , to us it is plain They will patch up their hulks for another campaign , Their valor to prove , and their havoc to spread When Wellington 's army is missing or dead . ON THE LOSS OF THE PRIVATEER BRIGANTINE GENERAL ARMSTRONG Captain Samuel C. Reid , of New-York , which sailed from Sandy Hook , on a cruise , the ninth of September , 1814 , and on the 26th came to anchor in the road of Fayal , one of the Azores , or Western Islands , a neutral port belonging to the crown of Portugal . She anchored in that port for the purpose of procuring a supply of fresh water , when she was attacked by the british ship of war Plantaganet , of 74 guns , capt . Lloyd ; the Rota frigate of 36 guns , and the armed national brig Carnation , of 18 guns , and many barges of considerable force , all of which she repulsed , with an immense slaughter , and was then scuttled and sunk by order of Captain Reid , to prevent her falling into the hands of the enemy . The Armstrong arrived in the port of Fayal , And her actions of valor we mean to recall ; Brave Reid , her commander , his valorous crew , The heroes that aided , his officers , too . Shall it fall to their lot To be basely forgot ? O no ! while a bard has a pen to command Their fame shall resound through american land . In the road of Fayal , when their anchors were cast , The british were watching to give them a blast ; Not far from the port , for destruction sharp set , Lay the Rota , Carnation , and Plantagenet : With a ship of the line Did a frigate combine , And a brig of great force , with her boats in the rear , To capture or burn one New-York privateer ! Four boats from the brig were despatch 'd in great haste , And onward they came , of the Armstrong to taste ; To taste of her powder , to taste of her ball , To taste of the death she must hurl on them all !— They came in great speed , And with courage , indeed , Well mann 'd and well arm 'd — so they got along side , Destruction their motto , damnation their guide . Now the Armstrong , with vengeance , had open 'd her fire , And gave them as much as they well could desire ; A score of them fell — full twenty fell dead — Then quarters ! they cried , and disgracefully fled :— To their ships they return 'd Half shatter 'd and burn 'd — Not quite in good humor , perhaps in a fret , And waited new orders from Plantagenet . Then the Armstrong haul 'd in , close abreast of the beach , So near , that a pistol the castle could reach ; And there she awaited the rest of their plan , And there they determined to die , to a man , Ere the lords of the waves With their sorrowful slaves , The tyrants , who claim the command of the main , With strength , though superior , their purpose should gain . And now the full moon had ascended the sky , Reid saw by her light that the british were nigh : The bell of Fayal told the hour — it was nine — When the foe was observed to advance in a line ; They manoeuvred a while With their brig , in great style , Till midnight approach 'd when they made their attack , Twelve boats , full of men , and the brig at their back ! They advanced to the conflict as near as they chose , When the Armstrong her cannon discharged on her foes — The town of Fayal stood aghast in amaze The Armstrong appear 'd like all hell in a blaze ! At the blast of Long Tom The foe was struck dumb : O lord ! are the sons of old England alarm 'd — With music like this they were formerly charm 'd ! Huzza for old England ! three cheers , and a damn ! And up to the conflict they manfully came ; On the bows and the quarters they grappled a hold , And board ! was the word in those barges so bold ; But board they could not — to no devil she strikes , So the Armstrong repell 'd them with pistols and pikes — From her musquetry fire They by dozens expire ! And soon was the work of destruction complete , And soon was determined their total defeat —! Three hundred brave fellows were wounded and kill 'd , Their boats and their barges with slaughter were fill 'd ; With shame they retreated , the few that remain 'd , To tell the event of the battle — not gain 'd : Their commander in chief Was astounded with grief !— Dont grieve , my good fellows — he hail 'd them — I beg I too have my wounds — “ an ox trod on my leg ! ” But to save the stout Armstrong — even Reid could not do — A ship of the line with a frigate in tow —! A brig of their navy accoutred for war —! All this was too much for e'en yankees to dare : So he scuttled his barque — Nor need we remark That she sunk on the sands by the beach of Fayal With her colors all flying — no colors could fall ! Of neutrals what nonsense some tell us each day ! Exists there a neutral where Britain has sway ? The rights of a neutral !— away with such stuff — What neutral remains that can England rebuff ?— To be safe from disgrace The deep seas are our place : The flag of no neutral our flag can defend , By ourselves we must fight , on ourselves must depend . Now in bumpers of reason , success to brave Reid ! Himself and his heroes are heroes indeed !— In conquests , like this , can an englishman glory , One traitor among us , one Halifax tory ? If they can — let them brag — Here 's success to our flag ! May it ever be ready , the britons to maul , As the Armstrong behaved in the road of Fayal .— ON THE BRIGANTINE PRIVATEER Prince de Neufchatel<span type="note_anchor">[ 210 ]</span>Ordonneaux , commander , which arrived at Boston some time since , from a cruise of three months , chiefly in the english and irish channels , in which she captured thirteen or fourteen valuable prizes , to the amount , it was said , of more than a million of dollars . Quid petis hic est .— Martial . What is wealth , that men will roam , Risque their all , and leave their home , Face the cannon , beat the drum , And their lives so cheaply sell ! Let them reason on the fact Who would rather think than act — Their brains were not with morals rack 'd Who mann 'd the prince of Neufchatel . Having play 'd a lucky game , Homeward , with her treasure , came This privateer of gallant fame , Call 'd the prince of Neufchatel . Are the english cruisers near ? Do they on the coast appear To molest this privateer ?— — She shall be defended well . Soon a frigate hove in sight :— As the wind was rather light , She , five barges , out of spite , Sent , to attack , with gun and blade . On our decks stood rugged men , Little more than three times ten ; And I tremble , while my pen Tells the havoc that was made . Up they came , with colors red , One a stern , and one a head — Shall I tell you what they said ?— Yankees ! strike the buntin rag ! Three were ranged on either side — Then the ports were open 'd wide , And the sea with blood was dyed ; Ruin to the english flag ! Now the angry cannons roar , Now they hurl the storm of war , Now in floods of human gore Swam the prince of Neufchatel ! Then the captain , Ordonneaux , Seconded the seaman 's blow , And the remnant of the foe Own 'd the brig defended well . For the million she contain 'd He contended , sword in hand , Follow 'd by as brave a band Of tars , as ever , trod a deck . In these bloody barges , five , Scarce a man was left alive , And about the seas they drive ; Some were sunk , and some a wreck . Every effort that they made With boarding pike , or carronade , Every effort was repaid , Scarcely with a parallel ! Fortune , thus , upon the wave , Crown 'd the valor of the brave :— Little lost , and much to save , Had the prince of Neufchatel .<span type="note_anchor">[ 210 ]</span>Of the numerous vessels fitted out during the war by private parties to prey on British commerce the Prince de Neufchatel was doubtless the most successful . THE PARADE AND SHAM-FIGHT A Pine Forest Picture — on a Training Day . —— Invictaque bello Dextera ! non illi se quisquam impune tulisset Obvius armato —— Virg . The drum was beat , the flag display 'd , The soldiers met upon parade , And all for action ready made With loud huzza ! When forth a stately figure strode , Of stature such , of such a mode , As those who lived before the flood , If stuff 'd with straw . His vigor seem 'd by years unbroke ; But then his phiz had such a look , As if preserved in Etna 's smoke For half an age . God help us all to look our best ! This man was captain of the rest , And valor seem 'd to fire his breast With martial rage . His horse was of an iron grey ; ( A prancing steed he rode that day ,) Not of the bold virginian breed , Nor yet remote from Quixote 's steed . This chief was of the bullet mould ; To meet the conflict , firm and bold , His coat was patch 'd , his boots new soal 'd , Ham stuff 'd his maw : Two pounds of powder fill 'd his horn , His pantaloons were old and worn , A cap and hat his head adorn — The chapeau bras . With vengeance heated , long in store , He sallied forth , a man of war ; And all that meet him , pray take care Of rusty pikes . He had no helmet for the head , But death and ruin near him tread , And slaughter , in a suit of red , That deadly strikes . A blanket from his shoulders hung , Three dollars in his pockets rung , And to his thigh a faulchion clung , That made us quake : A veteran in the fighting trade ! The owner of so keen a blade ! Do not provoke him , man or maid , For mercy 's sake . O could you but one furlong ride With such a faulchion at your side , Your bosom would for glory beat And show Napoleon all complete ! Two pistols , to his girdle tied , Foreboded vengeance , far and wide , To all that were not on our side , With heart and hand . Accoutred thus , with martial air , He gave the warning word , “ Take care ! ” And , in a moment , all was war , Sublime and grand . They march 'd , and march 'd , as thick as bees . Then march 'd towards a clump of trees ; And “ blaze away ! ” the leader says — “ Each take his aim ! “ Who wounds a tree can kill a man — “ If you but practise on that plan , “ The britons shall go home again With grief and shame ! ” Not Philip 's famed , unrivall 'd son , For Greece subdued , or India won , Not Cockburn , burning Washington , Look 'd so elate : Not Bonaparte , on Egypt 's sands With such importance gave commands , With such discretion train 'd his bands , Assumed such state ! Not Caesar , when he pass 'd the Rhine , Not Marlborough leading up his line , Not Perry , when he said , “ they 're mine ! ” Put on such airs ;— As now were shown to front and rear When victory seem 'd to hover near . Indeed not purchased very dear — No wounds nor scars . Departing from the norman shore , Not William such a feature wore When England hail 'd him conqueror , With loud acclaim : Not Fulton , when his steam he try 'd And Neptune 's car stemm 'd Hudson 's tide Felt such a generous glow of pride For well earn 'd fame . That day Cornwallis met his fate , Not Washington felt half so great When tow'rd him flew the gallic fleet To share his smile : Not conquest had for Gates such charms When , yielding to the victor 's arms , He bade Burgoyne resign his arms , In soldier 's style . Not Ajax ’ self , with such a grace Gave orders to attack a place ; Not Hannibal with bolder face Approach 'd old Rome ,— When marching for the Tiber shore , He yet his alpine jacket wore , And hoped to sweep the senate floor , And fix their doom : Not Parker , [ A ] when he cross 'd the bar Of Charleston with his men of war , Was , near fort Moultrie , half so sure Of victory gain 'd : [ A ] Sir Peter Parker , it is well remembered , attacked fort Moultrie , on Sullivan 's Island , in 1776 , and after a sanguinary action , was repulsed with great loss .— Freneau 's note . Not Parker , when departing thence So shatter 'd — at the king 's expense — Was so provoked at the defence , Felt so chagrined , As did our chief ( no captain Brag ) When he perceiv 'd some worthless wag Had stolen away the brandy keg — Ah ! loss indeed ! For this , he swore he would resign , All future trust in man decline ; Of whom , at least , there was one swine , They all agreed — And cry 'd “ like hell his heart is black — Pursue him , boys , and scent his track , If drunk or dead , we 'll have him back , This man of scum ! ” Each took his mark , and hit a tree ; The battle 's done !— all sober , we ; Huzza ! we have the victory ! Then scamper 'd home ! RETALIATION A Marine Ode — 1814 “ Ye powers who rule the western gale Not for the golden fleece we sail , Nor yet on wild ambition 's plan , But vengeance gathers man with man . For wrongs which wearied patience bore , For slighted rules of legal war , We rear our flag , our sails display , And east north east explore our way . Let some assert , ten thousand pounds Would place our fleet on british grounds , And urge us onward to saint James To wrap his palaces in flames . A motive of so mean a cast Allures no mind , excites no breast ; From such reward we loathing turn And would at such a proffer spurn . No — to retaliate on the foe , Free-will 'd , we independent go , Our ship well mann 'd , in war 's attire , To light the skies with english fire . November comes ! tis time to sail , The nights are long and brisk the gale , And England , soon , the odds may prove Between our hatred and our love . ” ON THE LAUNCHING Of the Seventy-four Gun Ship Independence ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 211 ]</span>at Charlestown , near Boston Our trade to restore as it stood once before We have launched a new ship from the stocks , Her rate is our first , and her force will , we trust , Be sufficient to humble the hawks ; The hawks of old England we mean , do n't mistake , Some harpies of England our prizes we 'll make . Independence her name , independent our minds , And prepared for the toils of the sea , We are ready to combat the waves and the winds , And fight till the ocean is free : Then , away to your stations , each man on our list Who , when danger approaches , will never be miss 'd . In asserting our rights we have rather been slow And patient till patience was tired ; We were plunder 'd and press 'd ere we ventur 'd a blow Till the world at our patience admired , And language was held , of contempt and disgrace , And Europe mis-call 'd us a pitiful race . Twas time to arise in the strength of our might When Madison publish 'd the war , And many have thought that he would have been right Had he published it three years before ; While France was unpester 'd with traitors and knaves , Nor Europe polluted with Wellington 's slaves . To arm for our country is never too late , No fetters are yet on our feet ; Our hands are more free , and our hearts are as great As the best in the enemy 's fleet : And look at the list of their navy , and think , How many are left , to burn , capture , and sink ! Let the nations of Europe surrender the sea , Or crouch at the foot of a throne ; In liberty 's soil we have planted her tree , And her rights will relinquish to none : Then stand to your arms , Then stand to your arms , Then stand to your arms — half the battle is done ! And bravely accomplish what valor begun . The day is approaching , a day not remote , A day with impatience we hail , When Decatur and Hull shall again be afloat , And Bainbridge commission 'd to sail ; To raise his blockades , will advance on the foe , And bulwark with Bull to the bottom shall go . On the waves of Lake Erie we show 'd the old brag We , too , could advance in a line , And batter their frigates and humble their flag ; “ I have met them , ” said Perry , “ they 're mine ! ” And so , my dear boys , we can meet them again On the waves of the sea , or the waves of Champlain . To the new Independence then , pour out a glass , And drink , with the sense of a man : She soon will be ready , this pride of her class , Sir Thomas [ A ] to meet on his plan : He hates our torpedoes — then teaze him no more , Let him venture his luck with our Seventy-four . Then stand to your arms , you shall ne'er be enslav 'd , Let the battle go on till the nation is saved ! [ A ] Sir Thomas Hardy , of the Ramillies 74 .— Freneau 's note .<span type="note_anchor">[ 211 ]</span>The Independence was one of the four 74-gun frigates authorized by Congress at the opening of the war . It was launched late in 1814 , too late to play any part in the war . THE BROOK OF THE VALLEY The world has wrangled half an age , And we again in war engage , While this sweet , sequester 'd rill Murmurs through the valley still . All pacific as you seem : Such a gay elysian stream ;— Were you always thus at rest How the valley would be blest . But , if always thus at rest ; This would not be for the best : In one summer you would die And leave the valley parch 'd and dry . Tell me , where your waters go , Purling as they downward flow ? Stagnant , now , and now a fall ?— To the gulph that swallows all . Flowing , peaceful , from your urn Are your waters to return ?— Though the same you may appear , You 're not the same we saw last year . Not a drop of that remains — Gone to visit other plains , Gone , to stray through other woods , Gone , to join the ocean floods ! Yes — they may return once more To visit scenes they knew before ;— Yonder sun , to cheer the vale From the ocean can exhale Vapors , that your waste supply , Turn 'd to rain from yonder sky ; Moisture , vapors , to revive And keep your margin all alive . But , with all your quiet flow , Do you not some quarrels know ! Lately , angry , how you ran ! All at war — and much like man . When the shower of waters fell , How you raged , and what a swell ! All your banks you overflow 'd , Scarcely knew your own abode ! How you battled with the rock ! Gave my willow such a shock As to menace , by its fall , Underwood and bushes , all : Now you are again at peace : Time will come when that will cease ; Such the human passions are ; — You again will war declare . Emblem , thou , of restless man ; What a sketch of nature 's plan ! Now at peace , and now at war , Now you murmur , now you roar ; Muddy now , and limpid next , Now with icy shackles vext — What a likeness here we find ! What a picture of mankind !</p>

    <p n="2">THE AMERICAN VILLAGE .<span type="note_anchor">[ 212 ]</span></p>
    <p n="3">WHERE yonder stream divides the fertile plain , Made fertile by the labours of the swain ; And hills and woods high tow'ring o'er the rest , Behold a village with fair plenty blest : Each year tall harvests crown the happy field ; Each year the meads their stores of fragrance yield , And ev'ry joy and ev'ry bliss is there , And healthful labour crowns the flowing year .</p>
    <p n="4">THOUGH Goldsmith weeps in melancholy strains , Deserted Auburn and forsaken plains , And mourns his village with a patriot sigh , And in that village sees Britannia die : Yet shall this land with rising pomp divine , In it 's own splendor and Britannia 's shine . O muse , forget to paint her ancient woes , Her Indian battles , or her Gallic foes ; Resume the pleasures of the rural scene , Describe the village rising on the green , It 's harmless people , born to small command , Lost in the bosom of this western land :</p>
    <p n="5">SO shall my verse run gentle as the floods , So answer all ye hills , and echo all ye woods ; So glide ye streams in hollow channels pent , Forever wasting , yet not ever spent . Ye clust'ring boughs by hoary thickets borne ! Ye fields high waving with eternal corn ! Ye woodland nymphs the tender tale rehearse , The fabled authors of immortal verse : Ye Dryads fair , attend the scene I love , And Heav'n shall centre in yon ’ blooming grove . What tho ’ thy woods , AMERICA , contain The howling forest , and the tiger 's den , The dang'rous serpent , and the beast of prey , Men are more fierce , more terrible than they . No monster with it 's vile contagious breath , No flying scorpion darting instant death ; No pois'nous adder , burning to engage , Has half the venom or has half the rage . What tho ’ the Turk protests to heav'n his ire , With lift up hand amidst his realms of fire ; And Russia 's Empress sends her fleets afar , To aid the havock of the burning war : Their rage dismays not , and their arms in vain , In dreadful fury bathe with blood the plain ; Their terrors harmless , tho ’ their story heard , How this one conquer 'd , or was nobly spar 'd : Vain is their rage , to us their anger vain , The deep Atlantic raves and roars between .</p>
    <p n="6">TO yonder village then will I descend , There spend my days , and there my ev'nings spend ; Sweet haunt of peace whose mud ’ wall 'd sides delight , The rural mind beyond the city bright : Their tops with hazles or with alders wove , Remurmur magic to the neighb'ring grove ; And each one lab'ring in his own employ , Comes weary home at night , but comes with joy : The soil which lay for many thousand years O'er run by woods , by thickets and by bears ; Now reft of trees , admits the chearful light , And leaves long prospects to the piercing sight ; Where once the lynx nocturnal sallies made , And the tall chestnut cast a dreadful shade : No more the panther stalks his bloody rounds , Nor bird of night her hateful note resounds ; Nor howling wolves roar to the rising moon , As pale arose she o'er yon eastern down . Some prune their trees , a larger load to bear Of fruits nectarine blooming once a year : See groaning waggons to the village come Fill 'd with the apple , apricot or plumb ; And heavy beams suspended from a tree , To press their juice against the winter 's day : Or see the plough torn through the new made field , Ordain 'd a harvest , yet unknown to yield . The rising barn whose spacious floor receives The welcome thousands of the wheaten sheaves , And spreads it 's arms to take the plenteous store , Sufficient for its master and the poor : For as Eumoeus us 'd his beggar guest The great Ulysses in his tatters drest : So here fair Charity puts forth her hand , And pours her blessings o'er the greatful land : No needy wretch the rage of winter fears , Secure he sits and spends his aged years , With thankful heart to gen'rous souls and kind , That save him from the winter and the wind .</p>
    <p n="7">A LOVELY island once adorn 'd the sea , Between New-Albion and the Mexic ’ Bay ; Whose sandy sides washed by the ocean wave , Scarce heard a murmur but what ocean gave : Small it 's circumference , nor high it 's coast , But shady woods the happy isle could boast ; On ev'ry side new prospects catch 'd the eye , There rose blue mountains to the arched sky : Here thunder 'd ocean in convulsive throws , And dash 'd the island as it 's waters rose : Yet peaceful all within , no tumults there , But fearless steps of the unhunted hare ; And nightly chauntings of the fearless dove , Or blackbird 's note , the harbinger of love . So peaceful was this haunt that nature gave , Still as the stars , and silent as the grave ; No loud applause there rais 'd the patriot breast , No shouting armies their mad joy confest , For battles gain 'd , or trophies nobly won , Or nations conquer 'd near the rising sun ; No clam'rous crews , or wild nocturnal cheer , Or murd'rous ruffians , for no men were here . On it 's east end a grove of oak was seen , And shrubby hazels fill 'd the space between ; Dry alders too , and aspin leaves that shook With ev'ry wind , conspired to shade a brook , Whose gentle stream just bubbling from the ground , Was quickly in the salter ocean drown 'd : Beyond whose fount , the center of the isle , Wild plumb trees flourish 'd on the shaded soil . In the dark bosom of this sacred wood , Secluded from the world , and all it 's own , Of other lands unknowing , and unknown . Here might the hunter have destroy 'd his prey , Transfix 'd the goat before the dawn of day ; And trudging homeward with his welcome load , The fruit of wand'rings thro ’ each by-way road : Thrown down his burthen with the needless sigh , And gladly feasted his small family . Small fields had then suffic 'd , and grateful they , The annual labours of his hands to pay ; And free his right to search the briny flood For fish , or slay the creatures of the wood .</p>
    <p n="8">THUS spent his days in labour 's pleasant pain , Had liv 'd and dy 'd the homely shepherd swain : Had seen his children and his children 's heirs , The fruit of love and memory of years To agriculture 's first fair service bent , The work of mortals , and their great intent . So had the Sire his days of pleasure known , And wish 'd to change no country for his own : So had he with his fair endearing wife , Pass 'd the slow circle of a harmless life ; With happy ignorance divinely blest , The path , the centre and the home of rest . Long might the sun have run his bright career , And long the moon her mantled visage rear ; And long the stars their nightly vigils kept , And spheres harmonious either sung or wept : He had not dream 'd of worlds besides his own , And thought them only stars , beyond the moon ; Enjoy 'd himself , nor hear 'd of future hell , Or heav'n , the recompence of doing well ; Had scarcely thought of an eternal state , And left his being in the hands of fate .— O had this isle such souls sublime contain 'd , And there for ages future sons remain 'd : But envious time conspiring with the sea , Wash 'd all it 's landscapes , and it 's groves away . It 's trees declining , stretch 'd upon the sand , No more their shadows throw across the land . It 's vines no more their clust'ring beauty show , Nor sturdy oaks embrace the mountain 's brow . Bare sands alone now overwhelm the coast , Lost in it 's grandeur , and it 's beauty lost .</p>
    <p n="9">THUS , tho ’ my fav'rite isle to ruin gone , Inspires my sorrow , and demands my moan ; Yet this wide land it 's place can well supply With landscapes , hills and grassy mountains high . O HUDSON ! thy fair flood shall be my theme , Thy winding river , or thy glassy stream ; On whose tall banks tremendous rocks I spy , Dread nature in primaeval majesty . Rocks , to whose summits clouds eternal cling , Or clust'ring birds in their wild wood notes sing . Hills , from whose sides the mountain echo roars , Rebounding dreadful from the distant shores ; Or vallies , where refreshing breezes blow , And rustic huts in fair confusion grow , Safe from the winds , secur 'd by mountains high , That seem to hide the concave of the sky ; To whose top oft ’ the curious hind ascends , And wonders where the arch 'd horizon bends ; Pleas 'd with the distant prospects rising new , And hills o'er hills , a never ending view . Through various paths with hasty step he scours , And breathes the odours of surrounding flow'rs , Caught from their bosoms by the fragrant breath , Of western breezes , or the gale of death . [ A ] Then low descending , seeks the humble dome , And centres all his pleasures in his home , ‘ Till day returning , brings the welcome toil , To clear the forest , or to tame the soil ; To burn the woods , or catch the tim'rous deer , To scour the thicket , or contrive the snare .</p>
    <p n="10">[ A ] South wind .— Freneau 's note .</p>
    <p n="11">SUCH was the life our great fore-fathers led , The golden season now from Britain fled , E'er since dread commerce stretch 'd the nimble sail , And sent her wealth with ev'ry foreign gale .— Strange fate , but yet to ev'ry country known , To love all other riches but it 's own . Thus fell the mistress of the conquer 'd earth , Great ROME , who owed to ROMULUS her birth . Fell to the monster Luxury , a prey , Who forc 'd a hundred nations to obey . She whom nor mighty CARTHAGE could withstand , Nor strong JUDEA 'S once thrice holy land : She all the west , and BRITAIN could subdue , While vict'ry with the ROMAN eagles flew ; She , she herself eternal years deny 'd , Like ROME she conquer 'd , but by ROME she dy 'd : But if AMERICA , by this decay , The world itself must fall as well as she . No other regions latent yet remain , This spacious globe has been research 'd in vain . Round it 's whole circle oft ’ have navies gone , And found but sea or lands already known . When she has seen her empires , cities , kings , Time must begin to flap his weary wings ; The earth itself to brighter days aspire , And wish to feel the purifying fire .</p>
    <p n="12">NOR think this mighty land of old contain 'd The plund'ring wretch , or man of bloody mind : Renowned SACHEMS once their empires rais 'd On wholesome laws ; and sacrifices blaz 'd . The gen'rous soul inspir 'd the honest breast , And to be free , was doubly to be blest : ‘ Till the east winds did here COLUMBUS blow , And wond'ring nations saw his canvas flow . ‘ Till here CABOT descended on the strand , And hail 'd the beauties of the unknown land ; And rav'nous nations with industrious toil , Conspir 'd to rob them of their native soil : Then bloody wars , and death and rage arose , And ev'ry tribe resolv 'd to be our foes . Full many a feat of them I could rehearse , And actions worthy of immortal verse : Deeds ever glorious to the INDIAN name , And fit to rival GREEK or ROMAN fame , But one sad story shall my Muse relate , Full of paternal love , and full of fate ; Which when ev'n yet the northern shepherd hears , It swells his breast , and bathes his face in tears , Prompts the deep groan , and lifts the heaving sigh , Or brings soft torrents from the female eye .</p>
    <p n="13">FAR in the arctic skies , where HUDSON 'S BAY Rolls it 's cold wave and combats with the sea , A dreary region lifts it 's dismal head , True sister to the regions of the dead . Here thund'ring storms continue half the year , Or deep-laid snows their joyless visage rear : Eternal rocks , from whose prodigious steep The angry tiger stuns the neighb'ring deep ; While through the wild wood , or the shrouded plain , The moose deer seeks his food , but often seeks in vain : Yet in this land , froze by inclement skies , The Indian huts in wild succession rise ; And daily hunting , when the short-liv 'd spring Shoots joyous forth , th ’ industrious people bring Their beaver spoils beneath another sky , PORT NELSON , and each BRITISH factory : In slender boats from distant lands they sail , Their small masts bending to the inland gale , On traffic sent to gain the little store , Which keeps them plenteous , tho ’ it keeps them poor . Hither CAFFRARO in his flighty boat , One hapless spring his furry riches brought ; And with him came , for sail 'd he not alone , His consort COLMA , and his little son . While yet from land o'er the deep wave he plough 'd , And tow'rds the shore with manly prowess row 'd . His barque unfaithful to it 's trusted freight , Sprung the large leak , the messenger of fate ; But no lament or female cry was heard , Each for their fate most manfully prepar 'd , From bubbling waves to send the parting breath To lands of shadows , and the shade of death . O FATE ! unworthy such a tender train , O day , lamented by the Indian swain ! Full oft ’ of it the strippling youth shall hear , And sadly mourn their fortune with a tear : The Indian maids full oft ’ the tale attend , And mourn their COLMA as they 'd mourn a friend .</p>
    <p n="14">NOW while in waves the barque demerg 'd , they strive , Dead with despair , tho ’ nature yet alive : Forth from the shore a friendly brother flew , In one small boat , to save the drowning crew . He came , but in his barque of trifling freight , Could save but two , and one must yield to fate . O dear CAFFRARO , said the hapless wife , O save our son , and save thy dearer life : ‘ Tis thou canst teach him how to hunt the doe , Transfix the buck , or tread the mountain snow , Let me the sentence of my fate receive , And to thy care my tender infant leave . He sigh 'd , nor answer 'd , but as firm as death , Resolv 'd to save her with his latest breath : And as suspended by the barque 's low side , He rais 'd the infant from the chilling tide , And plac 'd it safe ; he forc 'd his COLMA too To save herself , what more could mortal do ? But nobly scorning life , she rais 'd her head From the flush 'd wave , and thus divinely said :</p>
    <p n="15">OF life regardless , I to fate resign , But thou , CAFFRARO , art forever mine . O let thy arms no future bride embrace , Remember COLMA , and her beauteous face , Which won thee youthful in thy gayest pride , With captives , trophies , victors at thy side ; Now I shall quick to blooming regions fly , A spring eternal , and a nightless sky , Far to the west , where radiant Sol descends , And wonders where the arch 'd horizon ends : There shall my soul thy lov 'd idea keep , And ‘ till thy image comes , unceasing weep . There , tho ’ the tiger is but all a shade , And mighty panthers but the name they had ; And proudest hills , and lofty mountains there , Light as the wind , and yielding as the air ; Yet shall our souls their ancient feelings have , More strong , more noble than this side the grave . There lovely blossoms blow throughout the year , And airy harvests rise without our care : And all our sires and mighty ancestors , Renown 'd for battles and successful wars , Behold their sons in fair succession rise , And hail them happy to serener skies . There shall I see thee too , and see with joy Thy future charge , my much lov 'd Indian boy : The thoughtless infant , whom with tears I see , Once sought my breast , or hung upon my knee ; Tell him , ah tell him , when in manly years , His dauntless mind , nor death nor danger fears , Tell him , ah tell him , how thy COLMA dy 'd , His fondest mother , and thy youthful bride : Point to my tomb thro ’ yonder furzy glade , And show where thou thy much lov 'd COLMA laid . O may I soon thy blest resemblance see , And my sweet infant all reviv 'd in thee . ‘ Till then I 'll haunt the bow'r or lonely shade , Or airy hills for contemplation made , And think I see thee in each ghostly shoal , And think I clasp thee to my weary soul . Oft , oft thy form to my expecting eye , Shall come in dreams with gentle majesty ; Then shall I joy to find my bliss began To love an angel , whom I lov 'd a man ! She said , and downward in the hoary deep Plung 'd her fair form to everlasting sleep ; Her parting soul it 's latest struggle gave , And her last breath came bubbling thro ’ the wave .</p>
    <p n="16">THEN sad CAFFRARO all his grief declares , And swells the torrent of the gulph with tears ; And senseless stupid to the shore is borne In death-like slumbers , ‘ till the rising morn , Then sorrowing , to the sea his course he bent Full sad , but knew not for what cause he went , ‘ Till , sight distressing , from the lonely strand , He saw dead COLMA wafting to the land . Then in a stupid agony of pray'r , He rent his mantle , and he tore his hair ; Sigh 'd to the stars , and shook his honour 'd head , And only wish 'd a place among the dead ! O had the winds been sensible of grief , Or whisp'ring angels come to his relief ; Then had the rocks not echo 'd to his pain , Nor hollow mountains answer 'd him again : Then had the floods their peaceful courses kept , Nor the sad pine in all it 's murmurs wept ; Nor pensive deer stray 'd through the lonely grove , Nor sadly wept the sympathising dove .— Thus far 'd the sire through his long days of pain , Or with his offspring rov 'd the silent plain ; Till years approaching , bow 'd his sacred head Deep in the dust , and sent him to the dead : Where now perhaps in some strange fancy 'd land , He grasps the airy bow , and flies across the strand ; Or with his COLMA shares the fragrant grove , It 's vernal blessings , and the bliss of love .</p>
    <p n="17">FAREWELL lamented pair , and whate'er state Now clasps you round , and sinks you deep in fate ; Whether the firey kingdom of the sun , Or the slow wave of silent Acheron , Or Christian 's heaven , or planetary sphere , Or the third region of the cloudless air ; Or if return 'd to dread nihility , You 'll still be happy , for you will not be .</p>
    <p n="18">NOW fairest village of the fertile plain , Made fertile by the labours of the swain ; Who first my drowsy spirit did inspire , To sing of woods , and strike the rural lyre : Who last shou 'd see me wand'ring from thy cells , And groves of oak where contemplation dwells , Wou 'd fate but raise me o'er the smaller cares , Of Life unwelcome and distressful years , Pedantic labours and a hateful ease , Which scarce the hoary wrinkled sage cou 'd please . Hence springs each grief , each long reflective sigh , And not one comfort left but poetry . Long , long ago with her I could have stray 'd , To woods , to thickets or the mountain shade ; Unfit for cities and the noisy throng , The drunken revel and the midnight song ; The gilded beau and scenes of empty joy , Which please a moment and forever die . Here then shall center ev'ry wish , and all The tempting beauties of this spacious ball : No thought ambitious , and no bold design , But heaven born contemplation shall be mine . In yonder village shall my fancy stray , Nor rove beyond the confines of to-day ; The aged volumes of some plain divine , In broken order round my hut shou 'd shine ; Whose solemn lines should soften all my cares , And sound devotion to th ’ eternal stars : And if one sin my rigid breast did stain , Thou poetry shou'dst be the darling sin ; Which heav'n without repentance might forgive , And which an angel might commit and live : And where yon ’ wave of silent water falls , O'er the smooth rock or Adamantine walls : The summer morns and vernal eves should see , MILTON , immortal bard my company ; Or SHAKESPEARE , DRYDEN , each high sounding name , The pride of BRITAIN , and one half her fame : Or him who wak 'd the fairy muse of old , And pleasing tales of lands inchanted told . Still in my hand , he his soft verse shou 'd find His verse , the picture of the poets mind : Or heav'nly POPE , who now harmonious mourns , “ Like the rapt seraph that adores and burns . ” Then in sharp satire , with a giant 's might , Forbids the blockhead and the fool to write : And in the centre of the bards be shown The deathless lines of godlike ADDISON ; Who , bard thrice glorious , all delightful flows , And wrapt the soul of poetry in prose .</p>
    <p n="19">NOW cease , O muse , thy tender tale to chaunt , The smiling village , or the rural haunt ; New scenes invite me , and no more I rove , To tell of shepherds , or the vernal grove .</p>

    <p n="21">THE FARMER 'S WINTER EVENING</p>
    <p n="22">A POEM</p>
    <p n="23">To the NYMPH I never saw .</p>
    <p n="24">FAR be the pleasures of the day , And mirth and festive joy from me , When cold December nips the plains , Or frozen January reigns . Far he the hunts-man 's noisy horn , And coursers fleet thro ’ thickets borne , Swift as the wind , and far the sight , Of snowy mountains , sadly white ; But thou , O night , with sober charms , Shall clasp me in thy sable arms . For thee I love the winter eve , The noisy day for thee I leave . Beneath some mountain 's tow'ring height , In cottage low I hail the night , Where jovial swains , with heart sincere , And timely mirth dishearten care : Each tells his tale , or chaunts a song Of her for whom he sigh 'd so long ; Of CLARA fair , or FLORA coy , Disdaining still her shepherd boy , While near the hoary headed sage , Recalls the days of youthful age , Describes his course of manly years , His journey thro ’ this vale of tears ; How champion he with champions met , And fiercely did they combat it , ‘ Till envious night in ebon chair , Urg 'd faster on her chariotteer , And robb 'd him , O for shame , of glory And feats fit for renown in story .— Thus spent in tales the ev'ning hour , And quaffing juice of sober pow'r , Which handsome KATE with malt did steep , To lead on balmy visag 'd sleep , While her neat hand the milk pail strains , A sav'ry supper for the swains . And now the moon exalted high , Gives lustre to the earth and sky , And from the mighty ocean 's glass , Reflects the beauty of her face : About her orb you may behold , A thousand stars of burnish 'd gold , Which slowly to the west retire , And lose awhile their glitt'ring fire .</p>
    <p n="25">O COULD I here find my abode , And live within this fancy 'd wood , With thee the weeks and years to pass , My pretty rural shepherdess ; With thee the cooling spring to sip , Or live upon thy damask lip : Then sacred groves , and shades divine , And all ARCADIA should be mine . Steep me , steep me some poppies deep In beechen bowl , to bring on sleep ; Love hath my mind in shackles kept , Thrice the cock crew , nor once I slept . O gentle sleep , wrap me in dreams , Of fields and woods , and running streams ; Of rivers wide , and castles rare , And be my lovely FLORA there : A larger draught , a larger bowl To gratify my drowsy soul ; “ A larger draught is yet in store , Perhaps with this you wake no more . ” Then I my lovely maid shall see thee Drinking the deep streams of LETHE , Where now dame ARETHUSA scatters Her soft stream with ALPHEUS ’ waters , To forget her earthly cares , Lost in LETHE , lost in years ! And I too will quaff the water , Lest it should be said , O daughter Of my giddy , wand'ring brain , I sigh 'd for one I 've never seen .</p>
    <p n="26">THE MISERABLE LIFE OF A PEDAGOGUE<span type="note_anchor">[ 213 ]</span></p>
    <p n="27">TO form the manners of our youth , To guide them in the way of truth , To lead them through the jarring schools , Arts , sciences , and grammar rules ; Is certainly an arduous work , Enough to tire out Jew or Turk ; And make a christian bite his nails , For do his best , he surely fails ; And spite of all that some may say , His praise is trifling as his pay .</p>
    <p n="28">FOR My part I , tho ’ vers 'd in booking , Still sav 'd my carcase from such cooking ; And always slyly shunn 'd a trade , Too trifling as I thought and said ; But at a certain crazy season , When men have neither sense or reason ; By some confounded misadventure , I found myself just in it 's centre .</p>
    <p n="29">ODD 'S fish and blood , and noun and neuter , And tenses present , past and future : I utter 'd with a wicked sigh , Where are my brains , or where am I ? The dullest creature of the wood , Knows how to shun the distant flood ; Whales , dolphins , and a hundred more , Are not the fools to run ashore .</p>
    <p n="30">WELL , now contented I must be , Forc 'd by the dame Necessity , Who like the tribunal of Spain , Let 's you speak once , but not again ; And swift to execute the blow , Ne'er tells you why or whence it 's so .</p>
    <p n="31">NOW I am ask 'd a thousand questions , Of ALEXANDERS and EPHESTIONS ; With sly designs to know if I Am vers 'd in GRECIAN history ; And then again my time destroy , With aukward grace to tell of TROY : From that huge giant POLYPHEMUS , Quite down to ROMULUS and REMUS . Then I 'm oblig 'd to give them lectures , On quadrants , circles , squares and sectors ; Or in my wretched mem'ry bear , What weighs a cubic inch of air .</p>
    <p n="32">“ SIR , here 's my son , I beg you 'd mind , The graces have been very kind , And on him all their blessings shed , [ Except a genius and a head ] Teach him the doctrine of the sphere , The sliding circle and the square , And starry worlds , I know not where : And let him quickly learn to say , Those learned words Penna , Pennae ; Which late I heard our parson call As learning , knowledge all in all . ”</p>
    <p n="33">AND then a city dame approaches , Known by her horsemen , chairs and coaches : “ Sir , here 's my son , teach him to speak The Hebrew , Latin , and the Greek : And this I half forgot , pray teach My tender boy — the parts of speech — But never let this son of me , Learn that vile thing astronomy : Upon my word it 's all a sham , ” — O I 'm your humble servant ma'am . There certainly is something in it — “ Boy , drive the coach off in a minute . ” And thus I 'm left in street or road , A laughing stock to half the crowd , To argue with myself the case , And prove its being to my face .</p>
    <p n="34">A plague I say on such employment , Where 's neither pleasure nor enjoyment : Whoe'er to such a life is ty 'd , Was born the day he should have dy 'd ; Born in an hour when angry spheres Were tearing caps , or pulling ears : And Saturn slow ‘ gainst swift Mercurius , Was meditating battles furious ; Or comets with their blazing train , Decreed their life , a life of pain .</p>
    <p n="35"><span type="note_anchor">[ 213 ]</span>This poem was undoubtedly written while Freneau was conducting his school at Flatbush early in 1772 . See Vol . I , page xxi .</p>
    <p n="36">UPON A VERY ANCIENT DUTCH HOUSE ON LONG ISLAND .<span type="note_anchor">[ 214 ]</span></p>
    <p n="37">Behold this antique dome by envious time , Grown crazy , and in ev'ry part decay 'd ; Full well , alas , it claims my humble rhyme , For such lone haunts and contemplation made .</p>
    <p n="38">Ah see the hearth , where once the chearful fire Blaz 'd high , and warm 'd the winter trav'lers toes ; And see the walls , which once did high aspire , Admit the storms , and ev'ry wind that blows .</p>
    <p n="39">In yonder corner , now to ruin gone , The ancient housewife 's curtain 'd bed appear 'd , Where she and her man JOHN did sleep alone , Nor nightly robber , nor the screech owl fear 'd .</p>
    <p n="40">There did they snore full oft ’ the whole night out , Smoking the sable pipe , ‘ till that did fall , Reft from their jaws by Somnus ’ sleepy rout , And on their faces pour 'd its scorched gall .</p>
    <p n="41">And in the compass of yon ’ smaller gang , The swain BATAVIAN once his courtship made , To some DUTCH lass , as thick as she was long ; “ Come then , my angel , come , ” the shepherd said ,</p>
    <p n="42">“ And let us for the bridal bed prepare ; For you alone shall ease my future life , And you alone shall soften all my care , My strong , my hearty , and industrious wife . ”</p>
    <p n="43">Thus they — but eating ruin now hath spread Its wings destructive o'er the antique dome ; The mighty fabrick now is all a shed , Scarce fit to be the wand'ring beggar 's home .</p>
    <p n="44">And none but me it 's piteous fate lament , None , none but me o'er it 's sad ashes mourn , Sent by the fates , and by APOLLO sent , To shed their latest tears upon it 's silent urn .</p>
    <p n="45"><span type="note_anchor">[ 214 ]</span>This is the germ of the poem , “ The Deserted Farm-House , ” Vol . I , p. 40 , supra . A comparison of the two versions will illustrate the thorough way in which Freneau often revised his poems .</p>
    <p n="46">B . LIST OF OMITTED POEMS .</p>
    <p n="47">It has been found necessary for various reasons to omit some of the poems that appear in the various editions of Freneau . For the most part this omitted material has no historic or poetic significance . Nothing would be gained by resurrecting it . It is only just to the poet , however , to state that aside from a single piece , nothing has been omitted on account of coarseness alone . In each case the earliest known title is given in the list that follows . When a title was significantly changed in later editions , the variation has been given in a foot note , with date of edition .</p>
