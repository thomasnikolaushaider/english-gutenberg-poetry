    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">Having the satisfaction of introducing to the Public this very pleasing and characteristic POEM , the FARMER 'S BOY , I think it will be agreeable to preface it with a short Account of the manner in which it came into my hands : and , which will be much more interesting to every Reader , a little History of the Author , which has been communicated to me by his Brother , and which I shall very nearly transcribe as it lies before me .</p>
    <p n="2">In November last year [ Footnote : This was written in 1799 . ] I receiv 'd a MS. which I was requested to read , and to give my opinion of it . It had before been shewn to some persons in London : whose indifference toward it may probably be explain 'd when it is consider 'd that it came to their hands under no circumstances of adventitious recommendation . With some a person must be rich , or titled , or fashionable as a literary name , or at least fashionable in some respect , good or bad , before any thing which he can offer will be thought worthy of notice .</p>
    <p n="3">I had been a little accustom 'd to the effect of prejudices : and I was determin 'd to judge , in the only just and reasonable way , of the Work , by the Work itself .</p>
    <p n="4">At first I confess , seeing it divided into the four Seasons , I had to encounter a prepossession not very advantageous to any writer : that the Author was treading in a path already so admirably trod by THOMSON ; and might be adding one more to an attempt already so often , but so injudiciously and unhappily made , of transmuting that noble Poem from Blank Verse into Rhime ; ... from its own pure native Gold into an alloyed Metal of incomparably less splendor , permanence , and worth .</p>
    <p n="5">I had soon , however , the pleasure of finding myself reliev 'd from that apprehension : and of discovering , that , although the delineation of RURAL SCENERY naturally branches itself into these divisions , there was little else except the General Qualities of a musical ear , flowing numbers , Feeling , Piety , poetic Imagery and Animation , a taste for the picturesque , a true sense of the natural and pathetic , force of thought , and liveliness of imagination , which were in common between Thomson and this Author . And these are qualities which whoever has the eye , the heart , the awakened and surrounding intellect , and the diviner sense of the Poet , which alone can deserve the name , must possess .</p>
    <p n="6">But , with these general Characters of true Poetry , “ The Farmer 's Boy ” has , as I have said , a character of its own . It is discriminated as much as the circumstances and habits , and situation , and ideas consequently associated , which are so widely diverse in the two Authors , could make it different . Simplicity , sweetness , a natural tenderness , that molle atque facetum which HORACE celebrates in the Eclogues of VIRGIL , will be found to belong to it .</p>
    <p n="7">I intend some farther and more particular CRITICAL REMARKS on this charming Performance . But I now pass to the Account of the Author himself , as given me by his Brother :... a Man to whom also I was entirely a stranger :... but whose Candor , good Sense , and brotherly Affection , appear in this Narrative ; and of the justness of whose Understanding , and the Goodness of his Heart , I have had many Proofs , in consequence of a correspondence with him on different occasions which have since arisen , when this had made me acquainted with him , and interested me in his behalf .</p>
    <p n="8">In writing to me , Mr. GEORGE BLOOMFIELD , who is a Shoemaker also , as his Brother , and lives at BURY , thus expresses himself .</p>
    <p n="9">“ As I spent five years with the Author , from the time he was thirteen years and a half old [ Footnote : This by farther recollection has since been discover 'd and stated by Mr. G. and Mr. R. BLOOMFIELD not to be quite exact . See p. viii . C. L .] till he was turned of eighteen , the most interesting time of life ( I mean the time that instruction is acquir 'd , if acquir 'd at all ) , I think I am able to give a better account of him than any one can , or than he can of himself : for his Modesty would not let him speak of his Temper , Disposition , or Morals . ”</p>
    <p n="10">“ ROBERT was the younger Child of GEORGE BLOOMFIELD , a Taylor , at HONINGTON . [ Footnote : This Village is between Euston and Troston , and about eight miles N E. of Bury . L .] His Father died when he was an infant under a year old . [ Footnote : Our Author was born , as his Mother has obligingly informed me , 3 Dec. 1766 . L .] His Mother [ Footnote : ELIZABETH , Daughter of ROBERT MANBY . Vide Note at the end of this Preface . ] was a Schoolmistress , and instructed her own Children with the others . He thus learn 'd to read as soon as he learn 'd to speak . ”</p>
    <p n="11">“ Though the Mother was left a Widow with six small Children , yet with the help of Friends she manag 'd to give each of them a little schooling . ”</p>
    <p n="12">“ ROBERT was accordingly sent to Mr. RODWELL , [ Footnote : This respectable Man is senior Clerk to the Magistrates of the Hundred of BLACKBOURN , in which Honington is situated , and has conducted himself with great propriety in this and other public employments . L .] of Ixworth , to be improved in Writing : but he did not go to that School more than two or three months , nor was ever sent to any other ; his Mother again marrying when ROBERT was about seven years old . ”</p>
    <p n="13">“ By her second Husband , JOHN GLOVER , she had another Family . ”</p>
    <p n="14">“ When Robert was not above eleven years old , the late Mr. W. AUSTIN , of SAPISTON , [ Footnote : This little Village adjoins to HONINGTON . L .] took him . And though it is customary for Farmers to pay such Boys only 1s . 6d . per week , yet he generously took him into the house . This reliev 'd his Mother of any other expence than only of finding him a few things to wear : and this was more than she well knew how to do . ”</p>
    <p n="15">“ She wrote therefore , ” Mr. G. BLOOMFIELD continues , “ to me and my Brother NAT ( then in London ) , to assist her ; mentioning that he , ROBERT , was so small of his age that Mr. AUSTIN said he was not likely to be able to get his living by hard labour . ”</p>
    <p n="16">Mr. G. BLOOMFIELD on this inform 'd his Mother that , if she would let him take the Boy with him , he would take him , and teach him to make shoes : and NAT promis 'd to clothe him . The Mother , upon this offer , took coach and came to LONDON , to Mr. G. BLOOMFIELD , with the Boy : for she said , she never should have been happy if she had not put him herself into his hands .</p>
    <p n="17">“ She charg 'd me , ” he adds , “ as I valued a Mothers Blessing , to watch over him , to set good Examples for him , and never to forget that he had lost his Father . ” I religiously confine myself to Mr. G. BLOOMFIELD 'S own words ; and think I should wrong all the parties concern 'd if in mentioning this pathetic and successful Admonition , I were to use any other . He came from Mr. AUSTIN 'S 29 June 1781 . [ Footnote : This date of his coming to Town is added by Mr. BLOOMFIELD himself since the first Edition . ]</p>
    <p n="18">Mr. G. BLOOMFIELD then lived at Mr. Simm 's , No . 7 , Pitcher'shYpppHeNcourt , Bell-alley , Coleman-street . “ It is customary , ” he continues , “ in such houses as are let to poor people in London , to have light Garrets fit for Mechanics to work in . In the Garret , where we had two turn-up Beds , and five of us worked , I received little ROBERT . ”</p>
    <p n="19">“ As we were all single Men , Lodgers at a Shilling per week each , oar beds were coarse , and all things far from being clean and snug , like what Robert had left at SAPISTON . Robert was our man , to fetch all things to hand . At Noon he fetch 'd our Dinners from the Cook 's Shop : and any one of our fellow workmen that wanted to have any thing fetched in , would send him , and assist in his work and teach him , for a recompense for his trouble . ”</p>
    <p n="20">“ Every day when the Boy from the Public-house came for the pewter pots , and to hear what Porter was wanted , he always brought the yesterday 's Newspaper . [ Footnote : There was then , neither as a resource for the exigencies of finance , nor as a Principle of supposed Policy , that unhappy Check which prevails now on the circulation of Newspapers , and other means of popular Information . L .] The reading of the Paper we had been us 'd to take by turns ; but after Robert came , he mostly read for us ,... because his time was of least value . ”</p>
    <p n="21">“ He frequently met with words that he was unacquainted with : of this he often complain 'd . I one day happen 'd at a Book-stall to see a small Dictionary , which had been very ill us 'd . I bought it for him for 4d . By the help of this he in little time could read and comprehend the long and beautiful speeches of BURKE , FOX , or NORTH .</p>

    <docImprint>“ One Sunday , after an whole day 's stroll in the country , we by accident went into a dissenting Meeting-house in the Old Jewry , where a Gentleman was lecturing . This Man fill 'd Robert with astonishment . The House was amazingly crowded with the most genteel people ; and though we were forc 'd to stand still in the aisle , and were much press 'd , yet Robert always quicken 'd his steps to get into the Town on a Sunday evening soon enough to attend this Lecture . “ The Preacher lived somewhere at the West End of the Town ... his name was FAWCET . His language , ” says Mr. G. BLOOMFIELD , “ was just such as the Rambler is written in ; his Action like a person acting a Tragedy ; his Discourse rational , and free from the Cant of Methodism . “ Of him Robert learn 'd to accent what he call 'd hard words ; and otherwise improv 'd himself ; and gain 'd the most enlarg 'd notions of PROVIDENCE . “ He went sometimes with me to a Debating Society [ Footnote : It is another of the Constitutional Refinements of these times to have fetter 'd , and as to every valuable purpose , silenc 'd , these Debating Societies . They were at least , to say the lowest of them , far better amusements than drunkenness , gambling , or fighting . They were no useless Schools to some of our very celebrated Speakers at the Bar and in Parliament : and , what is of infinitely more importance , they contributed to the diffusion of Political Knowledge and Public Sentiment . L .] at Coachmaker'shYpppHeNhall , but not often ; and a few times to Covent-garden Theatre . These are all the opportunities he ever had to learn from Public Speakers . As to Books , he had to wade through two or three Folios : an History of<country>England</country>, British Traveller , and a Geography . But he always read them as a task , or to oblige us who bought them . And as they came in sixpenny numbers weekly , he had about as many hours to read as other boys spend in play . ” “ I at that time , ” proceeds his Brother , “ read the<settlement>London</settlement>Magazine ; and in that work about two sheets were set apart for a Review ... Robert seem 'd always eager to read this Review . Here he could see what the Literary Men were doing , and learn how to judge of the merits of the Works that came out . And I observ 'd that he always looked at the Poet 's Corner . And one day he repeated a Song which he compos 'd to an old tune . I was much surpris 'd that a boy of sixteen [ Footnote : He was probably 17 ; as appears on the statement from the Author himself . See N. to p . xvii . ] should make so smooth verses : so I persuaded him to try whether the Editor of our Paper would give them a place in Poet 's Corner . And he succeeded , and they were printed . And as I forget his other early productions , I shall copy this . ”</docImprint>

   <p>The Writer of this Preface doubts whether he has been successful in adding the last Stanza to this beautiful and simply expressive song . But he imagin 'd that some thought of this kind was in the mind of the Author : and he was willing to endeavour to express it . The Breast which has felt Love , justly shrinks from the idea of its total extinction , as from annihilation itself . And there is even an high social and moral use in that order of Providence which exalts Sensations into tender and benign Passions ; those Passions into habitual Affections yet more tender ; and raises from those Affections Virtues the most permanent , the most necessary and beneficent , and the most endearing : thus expanding the sentiment into all the Charities of domestic and social Life .</p>
   <p>“ I remember , ” says Mr. G. BLOOMFIELD , continuing his Narrative , “ a little piece which he called the Sailor 's Return : [ Footnote : It is much to be wished that this may be discovered . L .] in which he tried to describe the feelings of an honest Tar , who , after a long absence , saw his dear native Village first rising into view . This too obtain 'd a place in the Poet 's Corner . ”</p>
   <p>“ And as he was so young , ” his brother proceeds , “ it shews some Genius in him , and some Industry , to have acquir 'd so much knowledge of the use of words in so little time . Indeed at this time myself and my fellow workmen in the Garret began to get instructions from him , though not more than sixteen years old . ” [ Footnote : What simple magnanimity and benevolence in this Remark . L .]</p>
   <p>“ About this time there came a Man to lodge at our Lodgings that was troubled with fits . ROBERT was so much hurt to see this poor creature drawn into such frightful forms , and to hear his horrid screams , that I was forced to leave the Lodging . We went to Blue Hart-court , Bell-alley . In our new Garret we found a singular character , James Kay , a native of Dundee . He was a middle-aged man , of a good understanding , and yet a furious Calvinist . He had many Books , ... and some which he did not value : such as the SEASONS , PARADISE LOST , and some Novels . These Books he lent to ROBERT ; who spent all his leisure hours in reading the Seasons , which he was now capable of reading . I never heard him give so much praise to any Book as to that . ”</p>
   <p>“ I think it was in the year 1784 that the Question came to be decided between the journeymen Shoemakers ; whether those who had learn 'd without serving an Apprenticeship could follow the Trade . ”</p>
<note>Footnote : That is as journeymen : for there was no question that they could not as Masters on their own account . That a person may work as a journeyman without having served an apprenticeship , had already been determined , T. 9 . G. 3 . Beach v. Turner . Burr . Mansf . 2449 . A person also who has not served an Apprenticeship may be a partner , contributing money , or advice and attention to the accounts and general concerns of the Trade , provided that he does not actually exercise the Trade , and that the acting partner has served . Vide Reynolds v. Chase , M. 30 . G. 2 . Burr . Mansf . 2 . 1 Burn . J. P. Apprent . § 12 . L .</note>   <note xml:id="note" place="bottom" n="">That is as journeymen : for there was no question that they could not as Masters on their own account .

Vide Reynolds v. Chase , M. 30 . G. 2 . Burr . Mansf . 2 . 1 Burn . J. P. Apprent . § 12 . L .</note>
   <p>“ The Man by whom Robert and I were employ 'd , Mr. Chamberlayne , of Cheapside , took an active part against the lawful journeymen ; and even went so far as to pay off every man that worked for him that had joined their Clubs . This so exasperated the men , that their acting Committee soon looked for unlawful men ( as they called them ) among Chamberlayne 's workmen . ”</p>
   <p>They found out little Robert , and threatened to prosecute Chamlerlayne for employing him , and to prosecute his Brother , Mr. G. Bloomfield , for teaching him . Chamberlayne requested of the Brother to go on and bring it to a Trial ; for that he would defend it ; and that neither George nor Robert should be hurt .</p>
   <p>In the mean time George was much insulted for having refus 'd to join upon this occasion those who call 'd themselves , exclusively , the Lawful Crafts . George , who says he was never famed for patience , ( it is not indeed so much as might be sometimes wish 'd , very often the lot of strong and acute minds to possess largely of this virtue ,) took his pen , and address 'd a Letter to one of the most active of their Committee-men ( a man of very bad character ) . In this , after stating that he took Robert at his Mother 's request , he made free as well with the private character of this man as with the views of the Committee . “ This , ” says George , “ was very foolish ; for it made things worse : but I felt too much to refrain . ”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">What connects this episodical circumstance with the character of our</l>
     <l n="2">Author follows in his brother 's words .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ Robert naturally fond of Peace , and fearful for my personal safety ,</l>
     <l n="4">begg 'd to be suffer 'd to retire from the storm . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ He came home ; and Mr. AUSTIN kindly bade him take his house for his home till he could return to me . And here , with his mind glowing with the fine Descriptions of rural scenery which he found in THOMSON 'S SEASONS , he again retrac 'd the very fields where first he began to think . Here , free from the smoke , [ Footnote : But one word is altered in this Description ; which reminds one of the Omitte mirari beatae Fumum et opes Strepitumque Romae . L .] the noise , the contention of the city , he imbibed that Love of rural Simplicity and rural Innocence , which fitted him , in a great degree , to be the writer of such a thing as the Farmer 's Boy . ”</p>
   <p>“ Here he liv 'd two Months :... at length , as the dispute in the trade still remain 'd undecided , Mr. DUDBRIDGE offer 'd to take Robert Apprentice , to secure him , at all events , from any consequences of the Litigation . ”</p>
   <p>He was bound by Mr. Ingram , of Bell-alley , to Mr. John Dudbridge . His Brother George paid five shillings for Robert , by way of form , as a premium . Dudbridge was their Landlord , and a Freeman of the City of London . He acted most honourably , and took no advantage of the power which the Indentures gave him . George Bloomfield staid with Robert till he found he could work as expertly as his self .</p>
   <p>Mr. GEORGE BLOOMFIELD adds , “ When I left London he was turned of eighteen ; [ Footnote : This should seem to require correction by setting the Age forward according to the Dates above stated . C. L . ] and much of my happiness since has arisen from a constant correspondence which I have held with him . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ After I left him , he studied Music , and was a good player on the</l>
     <l n="2">Violin . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ But as my Brother Nat had married a Woolwich woman , it happen 'd that Robert took a fancy to MARY-ANNE CHURCH , a comely young woman of that town , whose Father is a boat-builder in the Government yard there . He married 12th Dec . 1790 . "[ Footnote : This Date from the Author . C. L . ] “ Soon after he married , Robert told me , in a Letter , that ‘ he had sold his Fiddle and got a Wife . ’ Like most poor men , he got a wife first , and had to get household-stuff afterward . It took him some years to get out of ready furnished Lodgings . At length , by hard working , &amp; c. he acquired a Bed of his own , and hired the room up one pair of stairs at 14 , Bell - alley , Coleman-street . The Landlord kindly gave him leave to sit and work in the light Garret , two pair of stairs higher . ”</p>
   <p>“ In this Garret , amid six or seven other workmen , his active Mind employ 'd itself in composing the Farmer 's Boy . ”</p>
   <p>“ In my correspondence I have seen several poetical effusions of his ; all of them of a good moral tendency ; but which he very likely would think do him little credit : on that account I have not preserv 'd them . ”</p>
   <p>“ ROBERT is a Ladies Shoemaker , and works for DAVIES , Lombard-street . He is of a slender make ; of about 5 F. 4 I. high ; very dark complexion .... His MOTHER , who is a very religions member of the Church of England , took all the pains she could in his infancy to make him pious : and as his Reason expanded , his love of God and Man increas 'd with it . I never knew his fellow for mildness of temper and Goodness of Disposition . And since I left him , universally is he prais 'd by those who know him best , for the best of Husbands , an indulgent Father , and quiet Neighbour . He is between thirty-three and four years old , [ Footnote : Corrected from the above Date , p. vi , to his present Age , May 1800 . C. L .] and has three Children ; ” two Daughters and a Son . [ Footnote : Added from the information of Mr. R. BLOOMFIELD . Hannah , born 25 Oct. 1791 . Mary Anne , 6 Sept. 1793 . Charles , 15 Sept . 1798 . ]</p>
   <p>Mr. GEORGE BLOOMFIELD concludes this clear , affectionate , and interesting Narrative , by a very kind Address to the Writer of this Preface . But , pleas 'd as I am with the good opinion of a Man like him , I must not take praise to myself for not having neglected or suppress 'd such a Work when it came into my hands . And I have no farther merit than that of seeing what it was impossible for an unprejudiced Mind not to see , and of doing what it was impossible not to do .</p>
   <p>But I join with him cordially in his prayer , “ that GOD , the Giver of thought , may , as mental light spreads , raise up many who will turn a listening ear , and will not despise</p>
   <p>“ The short and simple annals of the Poor . ”</p>
   <p>Very few words will complete what remains to be added .</p>
   <p>Struck with the Work , but not less struck with the remark , which is become a proverb , of the Roman Satirist , that “ it is not easy [ Footnote : Haud facile emergunt quorum virtutibus obstat Res angusta domi . ] for those to emerge to notice whose circumstances obscure the observation of their Merits , ” I sent it to a Friend , [ Footnote : This Friend , THOMAS HILL , Esq . I hope will forgive my mentioning him without asking his consent . ] whom I knew to be above these prejudices : and who has deserv 'd , and is deserving , well of the public , in many other instances , by his attention to Literature and the elegant Arts . He immediately express 'd an high satisfaction in it ; and communicated it to the Publishers . They adopted it upon terms honorable to themselves , and satisfactory to the Author , and to me in his behalf . They have publish 'd it in a manner which speaks abundantly for itself ; both as to the typographical accuracy and beauty , and the good taste and execution of the Ornaments in Wood .</p>
   <p>My part has been this , and it has been a very pleasing one : to revise the MS. making occasionally corrections with respect to Orthography , and sometimes in the grammatical construction . The corrections , in point of Grammar , reduce themselves almost wholly to a circumstance of provincial usage , which even well educated persons in Suffolk and Norfolk do not wholly avoid ; and which may be said , as to general custom , to have become in these Counties almost an established Dialect :... that of adopting the plural for the singular termination of verbs , so as to exclude the s. But not a line is added or substantially alter 'd through the whole poem . I have requested the MS. to be preserv 'd for the satisfaction of those who may wish to be satisfied on this head .</p>
   <p>The Proofs have gone through my hands . It has been printed slowly : because most carefully : as it deserv 'd to be printed .</p>
   <p>I have no doubt of its Reception with the Public : I have none of its going down to Posterity with honor ; which is not always the Fate of productions which are popular in their day .</p>
   <p>Thus much I know :... that the Author , with a spirit amiable at all times , and which would have been rever 'd by Antiquity , seems far less interested concerning any Fame or Advantage he may derive from it to himself , than in the pleasure of giving a printed Copy of it , as a tribute of duty and affection , to his MOTHER ; in whose pleasure , if it succeeds , his filial heart places the gratification of which it is most desirous . It is much to be a POET , such as he will be found :... it is more to be such a MAN .</p>

   <p>ELIZABETH MANBY , the Mother of the Author of this POEM , was sister to the wife of Mr. WILLIAM AUSTIN . I had written to Mr. GEORGE BLOOMFIELD to request the name , before Marriage , of his Mother . This gain 'd me an Answer , which I have great pleasure in adding .</p>
   <p>“ The late Mr. AUSTIN 'S wife was a Manby ( my Mother 's sister ) . And it may seem strange that , in the FARMER 'S BOY , Giles no where calls him Uncle , but Master .... The treatment that my Brother Robert experienced from Mr. Austin did not differ in any respect from the treatment that all the Servant Boys experienc 'd who lived with him . Mr. Austin was Father of fourteen Children by my Aunt ( he never had any other wife ) . He left a decent provision for the five Children that surviv 'd him : so that it could not be expected he should have any thing to give to poor Relations . And I do n't see a possibility of making a difference between GILES and the Boys that were not related to Mr. Austin : for he treated all his Servants exactly as he did his Sons . They all work 'd hard ; all liv 'd well . The DUKE had not a better Man Tenant to him than the late Mr. Austin . I saw numbers of the Husbandmen in tears when he was buried . He was beloved by all who knew him . But I imagine Robert thought that when he was speaking of Benevolence that was universal , he had no occasion to mention the accidental circumstance of his being related to the Good Man of whom he sung . ”</p>

    <head>I have mention 'd in the Preface “ THE SAILOR 'S RETURN ” , from an intimation by Mr. G. BLOOMFIELD . From the Author himself , Mr. ROBERT BLOOMFIELD , I am oblig 'd with what part he can recollect of this SONG , which I was desirous to recover . It was written shortly after the PEACE with AMERICA and FRANCE . Probably some time in the Spring of 1784 . The Author thinks the Title of it was “ THE SOLDIER 'S RETURN , ” and that it was occasion 'd by the arrival of some Regiments of British Soldiers from remote parts of the Globe .</head>

   <p>I think every Reader will be of opinion that it is indeed desirable the whole Song , of which this is a Fragment , should be recover 'd . It will probably be found ( according to the recollection of the Author ) either in the General Advertiser , Gazetteer , or Courant . From these specimens , and some I have since had the pleasure to see in MS. Mr. BLOOMFIELD appears fully to possess the simple , yet elegant , pathetic , and animated flow of Composition , the sweetness of Diction , Thought , and Numbers , which the SONG or BALLAD in their best character require .</p>
   <p>I now quote a little Fragment in blank verse from the same Letter : with a slight correction in a place or two where the distribution or mechanism of the lines was not exact .</p>
   <p>SUBJECT . An Harvest Scene : describing Gleaners return 'd from the Field .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">— Welcome the Cot 's</l>
     <l n="2">Warm walls !... thrice welcome Rest , by toil endear 'd ;</l>
     <l n="3">Each hard bed softening , healing every care .</l>
     <l n="4">Sleep on , ye gentle souls ...</l>
     <l n="5">Unapprehensive of the midnight thief !</l>
     <l n="6">Or if bereft of all with pain acquir 'd ,</l>
     <l n="7">Your fall , with theirs compar 'd who sink from affluence ,</l>
     <l n="8">With hands unus 'd to toil , and minds unus 'd</l>
     <l n="9">To bend , how little felt ! how soon repair 'd !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The ear of the Author seems as sweetly attun 'd to verse without as with Rhime : though his less practice has given him proportionally less exactness .</p>
   <p>It reminds one of the simple , tender , and flowing melody of the blank verse of ROWE : or of some of the affecting passages in the Paradise Regain 'd of MILTON .</p>
   <p>Sweetness , pastoral Content , the innocent and benevolent heart “ with a little pleas 'd , ” breathe indeed through the Poems , and in the manners and conversation , of the Author of THE FARMER 'S BOY .</p>
   <p>When the Spirit of CHRISTIANITY declares “ blessed are the meek , ” every heart which considers what meekness is , feels the truth of that blessedness . It may smooth the way , and prevent impediments , which a different temper raises to temporal felicity : it certainly assures that Heaven which is within : and is a pledge and anticipation of the Heaven hereafter .</p>
   <p>It is pleasing to think on a remark of Mr. GEO . BLOOMFIELD concerning his Brother when he first went to LONDON . “ I have him in my mind 's eye a little Boy ; not bigger than Boys generally are at twelve years old . When I met him and his Mother at the Inn , [ Footnote : In Bishopsgate-street . ] he strutted before us , dress 'd just as he came from keeping Sheep , Hogs , &amp; c .... his shoes fill 'd full of stumps in the heels . He looking about him , slip 'd up ... his nails were unus 'd to a flat pavement . I remember viewing him as he scamper 'd up ... how small he was . Little thought , that little fatherless Boy would be one day known and esteem 'd by the most learned , the most respected , the wisest and the best men of the Kingdom . ”</p>
   <p>The brotherly overflowing of the heart in this passage I felt when I read the Letter ( dated 27 March last ) , and cannot deny to others the pleasure of feeling it .</p>
   <p>And those who have shewn themselves the FRIENDS of the FARMER 'S BOY must excuse me if I mention some of them whose liberal and zealous attention had excited those feelings in the heart of his Brother , and have fill 'd his with sentiments of thankfulness . The Duke of GRAFTON has every way shewn himself attentive to the Genius , the Worth , of Mr. BLOOMFIELD . He has essentially added to his comforts . His R. H. the Duke of YORK , by Capt . BUNBURY , has made a liberal present , as an acknowledgment of the pleasure receiv 'd from the perusal of his excellent Poem . This attention of his R. H. liberal and amiable in itself , has been the cause of like liberality in others . It suggested to Dr. DRAKE , and other Gentlemen at HADLEIGH , the idea of a local subscription of a Guinea each in that Town and Neighbourhood . This has been carried into effect by himself and eleven other Friends , who may be said in this instance to sustain , in a manner , the honorable function of a kind of LITERARY JURY . The Names who have given this testimony of their high esteem to the character of Mr. BLOOMFIELD , and of the pleasure they have received from the perusal of his Poem , are :</p>
   <p>THOMAS SHERLOCKE GOOCH , Esq . Major POCKLINGTON , Dr. GIBBONS , M. D . The Rev . J. PLAMPIN , The Rev . T. KNOTTESFORD , The Rev . R. PRITCHETT , ABRAHAM REEVE , Esq . GEO . ARCHER , Esq . J . MILLS , Esq . Mrs . TRAIL , Mrs. LEAKE , NATHAN DRAKE , M. D .</p>
   <p>I have transcribed the names in the order in which they were transmitted to me . With a large proportion of those who have thus stood forth the Friends of Genius and Worth I have the pleasure of being acquainted . It gives me much satisfaction to mention this notice : welcome to the Author as a Gift ; and far more so as a testimony of good opinion unexpectedly offer 'd . Several instances of similar attention to the disproportion between the circumstances of the Author and the excellence of his poetical Talents and moral Qualities have spontaneously manifested themselves from different quarters . Those , as the separate act of individuals , I have not particularized otherwise than by this general acknowledgment : though many such have been mention 'd to me by the Author . This , as a collective act , I hope I may be allow 'd the gratification of thus noticing .</p>
   <p>Sir CHARLES BUNBURY has warmly expressed his approbation of the Poem ; as not only excellent for a Farmer 's Boy , but such as would do honour to any person , whatever his education : and he also has much contributed to make it early and advantageously known . Mr. GREEN of IPSWICH has spoken of it as a charming composition : reflecting , in a very natural and vivid manner , the series of interesting images which touch 'd the sensibility of a young , an artless , but a most intelligent observer of Nature ; plac 'd in a situation highly favourable to observation , though in fact not often productive of it . That Originality in such a subject is invaluable : and that this Poem appears to him ( I know few men so qualified to judge on such a point ) throughout original . And literary characters who have earnt to themselves much of true Praise by their own Productions , Mr. DYER and Dr. DRAKE of HADLEIGH , have given full and appropriate encomium to the excellence both in Plan and Execution , of this admirable RURAL PORM . My Friend Mr. BLACK of Woodbridge , has notic 'd it in a very pleasing and characteristic Letter address 'd to me in verse . I believe I shall not be just to the FARMER 's BOY if I omit to notice that the Taste and Genius of Mrs. OPIE , born to do honour to every department of the Fine Arts , have given her an high sentiment of its merits . And a LADY at BURY , whom I wish I were permitted to name , has most truly characteriz 'd it by remarking , that “ the descriptions of Country scenes , occupations , customs , and manners , are as natural as possible : and that the justness , virtue , and tenderness of the sentiments are to be equally admired . ” Were I to name all the Friends and Admirers of the POEM and of the simple and amiable manners and character of the AUTHOR , I should name , I believe , nearly every person in this Island whom I respect , esteem , and admire .</p>
   <p>It would be highly gratifying to me could I now transcribe those testimonies to which I have generally referr 'd :... but I abstain here from this : and the rather , as I believe Mr. DYER will probably soon express , in a Publication of his own , his sentiments on this Work ; and as Dr. DRAKE , I know , has been so struck with it as to intend to appropriate to an investigation of its peculiar merit the concluding part of an enlarg 'd Edition of his LITERARY HOURS . [ Footnote : This has been since excellently perform 'd by him . See the APPENDIX . ]</p>
   <p>The mention already made of the FARMER 'S BOY in the NEW LONDON REVIEW and in the MONTHLY MIRROR I have seen with pleasure . I rejoice in that Fame which is just to living Merit , and waits not for the Tomb to present the tardy and then unvalued Wreath : I rejoice in the sense express 'd not only of his Genius , but of his pure , benevolent , amiable Virtue , his affectionate Veneration to the DEITY , and his good Will to all .... Obscurity and Adversity have not broken ; Fame and Prosperity , I am persuaded , will not corrupt him .</p>
   <p>I cannot deny myself the satisfaction of mentioning that , after an absence of twelve years , the Author of the Farmer 's Boy has revisited his native Plains . That he has seen his Mother in health and spirits : seen her with a joy to both which even his own most expressive and pathetic language would imperfectly describe .... Seen other near , affectionate , and belov 'd Relatives : review 'd , with the feelings of a truly poetic and benevolent Mind , the haunts of his youth ; the Woods and Vales , the Cot , the Field and the Tree , which even recollected after so many years and at a distance , had awaken 'd in such a manner the energies of his Heart and Intellect , and had inspir 'd strains which will never cease to be repeated with pleasure and admiration . That he has been receiv 'd at BURY with an emulous desire of his society ; and certainly with the greatest reason . I rejoice that I at length have been made personally acquainted with him : that I have seen him here , and at his Mother 's , and at Bury : that I have discours 'd with him ; that we have made our rural walks together : that I have heard him read some of those Poems which are not yet printed ; but which when they shall be so , will support fully and extend the Fame he has acquir 'd . Though I have spent , occasionally , much of my life among persons worthy of Admiration and of Esteem , I can recollect few days so interesting and so valuable to me as these .</p>

      <l n="1">THE FARMER 'S life displays in every part</l>
      <l n="2">A moral lesson to the sensual heart .</l>
      <l n="3">Though in the lap of Plenty , thoughtful still ,</l>
      <l n="4">He looks beyond the present good or ill ;</l>
      <l n="5">Nor estimates alone one blessing 's worth ,</l>
      <l n="6">From changeful seasons , or capricious earth ;</l>
      <l n="7">But views the future with the present hours ,</l>
      <l n="8">And looks for failures as he looks for show'ers ;</l>
      <l n="9">For casual as for certain want prepares ,</l>
      <l n="10">And round his yard the reeking haystack rears ;</l>
      <l n="11">Or clover , blossom 'd lovely to the sight ,</l>
      <l n="12">His team 's rich store through many a wint'ry night .</l>
      <l n="13">What tho ’ abundance round his dwelling spreads ,</l>
      <l n="14">Though ever moist his self-improving meads</l>
      <l n="15">Supply his dairy with a copious flood ,</l>
      <l n="16">And seem to promise unexhausted food ;</l>
      <l n="17">That promise fails , when buried deep in snow ,</l>
      <l n="18">And vegetative juices cease to flow .</l>
      <l n="19">For this , his plough turns up the destin 'd lands ,</l>
      <l n="20">Whence stormy Winter draws its full demands ;</l>
      <l n="21">For this , the seed minutely small he sows ,</l>
      <l n="22">Whence , sound and sweet , the hardy turnip grows .</l>
      <l n="23">But how unlike to APRIL 'S closing days !</l>
      <l n="24">High climbs the Sun , and darts his pow'rful rays ;</l>
      <l n="25">Whitens the fresh-drawn mould , and pierces through</l>
      <l n="26">The cumb'rous clods that tumble round the plough .</l>
      <l n="27">O'er heaven 's bright azure hence with joyful eyes</l>
      <l n="28">The Farmer sees dark clouds assembling rise ;</l>
      <l n="29">Borne o'er his fields a heavy torrent falls ,</l>
      <l n="30">And strikes the earth in hasty driving squalls .</l>
      <l n="31">“ Right welcome down , ye precious drops , ” he cries ;</l>
      <l n="32">But soon , too soon , the partial blessing flies .</l>
      <l n="33">“ Boy , bring thy harrows , try how deep the rain</l>
      <l n="34">Has forc 'd its way . ” He comes , but comes in vain ;</l>
      <l n="35">Dry dust beneath the bubbling surface lurks ,</l>
      <l n="36">And mocks his pains the more , the more he works :</l>
      <l n="37">Still midst huge clods he plunges on forlorn ,</l>
      <l n="38">That laugh his harrows and the shower to scorn .</l>
      <l n="39">E'en thus the living clod , the stubborn fool ,</l>
      <l n="40">Resists the stormy lectures of the school ,</l>
      <l n="41">Till tried with gentler means , the dunce to please ,</l>
      <l n="42">His head imbibes right reason by degrees ;</l>
      <l n="43">As when from eve till morning 's wakeful hour ,</l>
      <l n="44">Light , constant rain , evinces secret pow'r ,</l>
      <l n="45">And ere the day resume its wonted smiles ,</l>
      <l n="46">Presents a cheerful easy task for Giles .</l>
      <l n="47">Down with a touch the mellow 'd soil is laid ,</l>
      <l n="48">And yon tall crop next claims his timely aid ;</l>
      <l n="49">Thither well pleas 'd he hies , assur 'd to find</l>
      <l n="50">Wild trackless haunts , and objects to his mind .</l>

      <l n="54">Ere yet the sun hath ting 'd its head with brown ;</l>
      <l n="55">Whilst thousands in a flock , for ever gay ,</l>
      <l n="56">Loud chirping sparrows welcome on the day ,</l>

      <l n="3">Invite my song ; that fain would boldly tell</l>
      <l n="4">Of upland coverts , and the echoing dell ,</l>
      <l n="5">By turns resounding loud , at eve and morn</l>
      <l n="6">The swineherd 's halloo , or the huntsman 's horn .</l>

      <l n="7">No more the fields with scatter 'd grain supply</l>
      <l n="8">The restless wand'ring tenants of the STY ;</l>
      <l n="9">From oak to oak they run with eager haste ,</l>
      <l n="10">And wrangling share the first delicious taste</l>
      <l n="11">Of fallen ACORNS ; yet but thinly found</l>
      <l n="12">Till the strong gale have shook them to the ground .</l>
      <l n="13">It comes ; and roaring woods obedient wave :</l>
      <l n="14">Their home well pleas 'd the joint adventurers leave :</l>
      <l n="15">The trudging sow leads forth her numerous young ,</l>
      <l n="16">Playful , and white , and clean , the briars among ,</l>

      <l n="21">Hot thirsty food ; whence doubly sweet and cool</l>
      <l n="22">The welcome margin of some rush-grown pool ,</l>
      <l n="23">The wild duck 's lonely haunt , whose jealous eye</l>
      <l n="24">Guards every point ; who sits prepar 'd to fly ,</l>

      <l n="31">The herd decamp with more than swinish speed ,</l>
      <l n="32">And snorting dash thro ’ sedge , and rush , and reed :</l>
      <l n="33">Through tangling thickets headlong on they go ,</l>
      <l n="34">Then stop , and listen for their fancied foe ;</l>
      <l n="35">The hindmost still the growing panic spreads ,</l>
      <l n="36">Repeated fright the first alarm succeeds ,</l>
      <l n="37">Till Folly 's wages , wounds and thorns , they reap :</l>
      <l n="38">Yet glorying in their fortunate escape ,</l>
      <l n="39">Their groundless terrors by degrees soon cease ,</l>
      <l n="40">And Night 's dark reign restores their wonted peace .</l>

      <l n="47">In vain may Giles , thro ’ gath'ring glooms that fall ,</l>
      <l n="48">And solemn silence , urge his piercing call :</l>
      <l n="49">Whole days and nights they tarry midst their store ,</l>

    <head>NOTES</head>
    <p n="1">A fav'rite morsel with the Rook , &amp; c. P. 9 , l. 104 .</p>
    <p n="2">In these verses , which have much of picturesque , there is a severe charge against Rooks and Crows , as very formidable depredators ; and their destruction , as such , seems to be recommended . Such was the prevalent opinion some years back . It is less general now : and I am sure the humanity of the Author , and his benevolence to Animals in general , will dispose him to rejoice in whatever plea can be offered in stay of execution of this sentence . And yet more so , if it shall appear that ROOKS , at least , deserve not only mercy , but protection and encouragement from the Farmer .</p>
    <p n="3">I shall quote a passage from BEWICK 'S interesting HISTORY of BIRDS : the narrative part of which is often as full of information as the embellishments cut in wood are beautiful .... It is this .</p>
    <p n="4">Speaking of Birds of the PIE-KIND in general , he says “ Birds of this kind [ Footnote : P. 63 ] are found in every part of the known world , from Greenland to the Cape of Good Hope . In many respects they may be said to be of singular benefit to mankind : principally by destroying great quantities of noxious insects , worms , and reptiles . ROOKS , in particular , are fond of the erucae of the hedge-chaffer , or chesnut brown beetle : for which they search with indefatigable pains . These insects , ” he adds in a note , “ appear in hot weather in formidable numbers : disrobing the fields and trees of their verdure , blossoms , and fruit ; spreading desolation and destruction wherever they go .... They appeared in great numbers in IRELAND during a hot summer , and committed great ravages . In the year 1747 whole meadows and corn-fields were destroyed by them in SUFFOLK . The decrease of Rookeries in that County was thought to be the occasion of it . The many Rookeries with us is in some measure the reason why we have so few of these destructive animals . "[ Footnote : Wallis 's History of Northumberland . ]</p>
    <p n="5">“ Rooks , ” he subjoins , “ are often accus 'd of feeding on the corn just after it has been sown , and various contrivances have been made both to kill and frighten them away ; but , in our estimation , the advantages deriv 'd from the destruction which they make among grubs , earth-worms , and noxious insects of various kinds , will greatly overpay the injury done to the future harvest by the small quantity of corn they may destroy in searching after their favourite food . ” [ Footnote : Mr. Bewick does not seem to have been quite aware that much of this mischief , as I have been informed by a sensible neighboring Farmer and Tenant , is done in the grub-state of the chaffer by biting through the roots of grass , &amp; c. A latent , and imperceptibly , but rapidly spreading mischief , against which the rooks and birds of similar instinct are , in a manner , the sole protection . C. L .]</p>
    <p n="6">“ In general they are sagacious , active , and faithful to each other . They live in pairs ; and their mutual attachment is constant . They are a clamorous race : mostly build in trees , and form a kind of society in which there appears something like a regular government . A Centinel watches for the general safety , and gives notice on the appearance of danger . ”</p>
    <p n="7">Under the Title , “ ROOKS , ” ( p. 71 ) Mr. BEWICK repeats his observations on the useful property of this Bird .</p>
    <p n="8">I confess myself solicitous for their safety and kind treatment . We have two which were lam 'd by being blown down in a storm ( a calamity which destroys great numbers almost every spring ) . One of them is perfectly domesticated . The other is yet more remarkable ; since although enjoying his natural liberty completely , he recognizes , even in his flights at a distance from the house , his adoptive home , his human friends , and early protectors .</p>
    <p n="9">The ROOK is certainly a very beautiful and very sensible Bird ; very confiding , and very much attach 'd . It will give me a pleasure , in which I doubt not that the Author of this delightful Poem will partake , if any thing here said shall avail them with the Farmer ; and especially with the SUFFOLK FARMER .</p>
    <p n="10">C. L .</p>
    <p n="11">Destroys life 's intercourse ; the social plan . P. 46 , l. 341 .</p>
    <p n="12">“ Allowing for the imperfect state of sublunary happiness , which is comparative at best , there are not , perhaps , many nations existing whose situation is so desirable ; where the means of subsistence are so easy , and the wants of the people so few . The evident distinction of ranks , which subsists at Otaheite , does not so materially affect the felicity of the nation as we might have supposed . The simplicity of their whole life contributes to soften the appearance of distinctions , and to reduce them to a level . Where the climate and the custom of the country do not absolutely require a perfec : garment ; where it is easy at every step to gather as many plants as form not only a decent , but likewise a customary covering ; and where all the necessaries of life are within the reach of every individual , at the expence of a trifling labour ; ambition and envy must in a great measure be unknown . It is true , the highest classes of people possess some dainty articles , such as pork , fish , fowl , and cloth , almost exclusively ; but the desire of indulging the appetite in a few trifling luxuries can at most render individuals , and not whole nations , unhappy . Absolute want occasions the miseries of the lower class in some civiliz 'd states , and is the result of the unbounded voluptuousness of their superiors . At Otaheite there is not , in general , that disparity between the highest and the meanest man , that subsists in England between a reputable tradesman and a labourer . The affection of the Otaheitans for their chiefs , which they never fail 'd to express upon all occasions , gave us great reason to suppose that they consider themselves as one family , and respect their eldest borm in the persons of their chiefs . The lowest man in the nation speaks as freely with his king as with his equal , and has the pleasure of seeing him as often as he likes . The king , at times , amuses himself with the occupations of his subjects ; and not yet deprav 'd by false notions of empty state , he often paddles his own canoe , without considering such an employment derogatory to his dignity . How long such an happy equality may last is uncertain : and how much the introduction of foreign luxuries may hasten its dissolution cannot be too frequently repeated to Europeans . If the knowledge of a few individuals can only be acquired at such a price as the happiness of nations , it were better for the discoverers and the discovered that the South Sea had still remain 'd unknown to Europe and its restless inhabitants . ”</p>

    <head>APPENDIX</head>
    <p n="14">When the FIRST EDITION of this POEM appear 'd in March last , I intimated a design of accompanying it with some CEITICAL REMARKS . With that design various Engagements have since greatly interfer 'd . From one of the most laborious and constant of those , that of the office of a Justice of the Peace for the County of Suffolk , I am now discharg 'd . Why those who are in power have done this , they have not explain 'd : and it being an office from which any one who holds it is removable at pleasure , they are not call 'd to explain . Had it been for Crime or Misconduct as a Magistrate , of course Trial and Conviction should have preceded my Removal . As it is , I feel , as I have publicly declar 'd , no shame in the removal . I have held an office honorable because extensively useful ; because unprofitable and burthensome to the individual ; because independently and conscientiously exercis 'd , with a devotion , such as it requir 'd , of my time , my thoughts , and my best faculties , daily to its discharge . My Collegues ,— and they are and have been , during a course of seventeen years , those of them who now act , and those who are dead or absent , men with whom to have acted was indeed satisfactory and pleasant ,— my late Collegues part with me , and I with them , regrettingly . Our reciprocal Esteem is not lessen 'd by this abruption of our official intercourse . And as every man who feels what Society is , ought to determine to be serviceable to the Public , my removal from this office neither weakens the determination , nor probably will be found to have impair 'd the means of effecting it . I am therefore well content ;— as I ought to be . I sought not the office . I have never sought any . It solicited my acceptance ; unask 'd and unexpected . I owe my appointment to the Duke of GRAFTON , very soon after I came to reside in this County . He was then Lord Lieutenant . I have not yielded that appointment to disgust ; though there were those who were not sparing in their endeavours to disgust me with it : I have not relinquished it to suit my convenience ; though in times like these an office of no little expence , and which shut me out from sources of professional emolument , was to me certainly not convenient : I have not consulted my ease or health by a voluntary retirement . I am remov 'd , I am superseded , I am struck out from an office of incredible and hourly increasing anxiety . Circumstances like this are not new . They have repeatedly taken place in relation to very high offices ; and the Public remembers men to whom they have happen 'd whose internal dignity and worth is above any official dignity . Had I felt that I merited to be remov 'd , I should not have thought myself a fit Editor of the FARMER 'S BOY ; a Poem which breathes every where modest independence , benevolence , innocence , and virtue . As it is , I think myself no way less fit than ever for any laudable and becoming employ . And I have accordingly announc 'd my intention of resuming my profession as a BARRISTER . In the mean time , the leisure which has thus been thrown to me may properly and usefully be devoted to the Remarks which I had before meditated ; and for which I had in some measure pledg 'd myself to the PUBLIC .</p>
    <p n="15">The FIRST of these will naturally be that which relates to the manner and circumstances of the Composition . There is such proof in it of Genius disregarding difficulty , and of powers of retention and arrangement , that it will be believ 'd I could not overpass it : and that it would have been stated at the first if it had been then in my power to state it .</p>
    <p n="16">I now lay it before the Public in the words of Mr. SWAN : who in a Letter address 'd to me in The Ladies Museum of this Month , after congratulating me on my “ successful efforts , ” ( and with such a Production to propose to public Attention how could they be unsuccessful ? ) “ in rescuing from oblivion a Poem , which for the harmony of its numbers , the beauty of its imagery , originality of thought , elegance and chasteness of diction , ( every circumstance consider 'd ,) stands unrivall 'd in the Annals of English Literature , and will descend to Posterity with increasing celebrity , ” states the motive on which he writes : ( a motive well meriting a Letter and a public statement :) “ to throw light upon the manner of the composition of the Farmer 's Boy ; which appears to him ( and most justly ) no inconsiderable addition to the well-earn 'd laurels of the Author . ”</p>
    <p n="17">For the pleasure of the view which it includes of the character and manners of Mr. BLOOMFIELD , I shall , with the Author of this interesting Letter , go beyond the mere fact ; and give his narration of the cause and manner of the Discovery , as well at the Discovery itself .</p>
    <p n="18">Mr. SWAN thus expresses himself :</p>
    <p n="19">“ From the pleasure I receiv 'd in reading the FARMER 'S BOY , and from some strange coincidences in the early part of Mr. Bloomfield 's life with my own , I was naturally enough anxious to become acquainted with the Author . For this purpose I obtain 'd his address , and found him ... the modest , the unambitious person you describe ; wondering at the praise and admiration with which his Poem has been receiv 'd ; whose utmost ambition was to have presented a fair copy to his aged Mother , as a pledge of filial affection , and a picture of his juvenile avocations . So unexpected was the fame of his production , that the whole of his good fortune appears to him as a dream . ” — ‘ I had no more idea , ’ says he , ‘ to be sent for by the Duke of Grafton , and be so kindly and generously treated , than of the hour I shall die . ’</p>
    <p n="20">“ I gave him , ” Mr. SWAN continues , “ my card of address , an invitation to my house , and a sincere profession of friendship ; if , among his numerous admirers , and noble and royal patrons , the latter was worthy of acceptance . ”</p>
    <p n="21">“ Last Sunday afternoon [ Footnote : The Letter is dated 12 July , 1800 . ] I was highly pleas 'd with his company , and gratified and entertain 'd with his conversation .— Sir , he is all ... nay , more than you have describ 'd . ”</p>
    <p n="22">“ Among other subjects of conversation respecting the Farmer 's Boy , I wish 'd to be inform 'd of his manner of composition . I enquir 'd , as he compos 'd it in a garret , amid the bustle and noise of six or seven fellow workmen , whether he us 'd a slate ; or wrote it on paper with a pencil , or pen and ink . But what was my surprize when told that he had us 'd neither .— My business , during the greatest part of my life having led me into the line of litterary pursuits , and made me acquainted with litterary men , I am , consequently , pretty well inform 'd of the methods us 'd by authors for the retention of their productions . We are told , if my recollection is just , that Milton took his Daughters as his amanuenses ; that Savage , when his poverty precluded him the conveniency of pen , ink , and paper , us 'd to study in the streets , and go into shops to record the productions of his fertile genius ; that Pope , when on visits at Lord Bolingbroke 's , us 'd to ring up the servants at any hour in the night for pen and ink , to write any thought that struck his lively and wakeful imagination ; that Dr. Blacklock , though blind , had the happy faculty of writing down , in a very legible hand , the chaste and elegant productions of his Muse . ”</p>
    <p n="23">“ With these and many other methods of composition we are acquainted ; but that of a great part of the Farmer 's Boy stands , in my opinion , first on the List of Litterary [ Footnote : I have ventur 'd to restore litterary to that mode of spelling , with the double t , which the Analogy of our language seems to require . L .] Phaenomena .— Sir , Mr. Bloomfield , either from the contracted state of his pecuniary resources to purchase Paper , or from other reasons , compos 'd the latter part of his Autumn and the whole of his Winter in his head , without committing one line to paper .— This cannot fail to surprize the Litterary World : who are well acquainted with the treacherousness of memory , and how soon the most happy ideas , for want of sufficient quickness in noting down , are lost in the rapidity of thought . ”</p>
    <p n="24">“ But this is not all .— He went still a step farther .— He not only compos 'd and committed that part of the work to his retentive memory , but he corrected it all in his head . And , as he said , when it was thus prepar 'd ,... I had nothing to do but to write it down . ”</p>
    <p n="25">“ By this new and wonderful mode of composition he studied and completed his Farmer 's Boy in a garret ; among six or seven workmen , without their ever suspecting any thing of the matter . ”</p>
    <p n="26">“ Sir , this to me was both new and wonderful : and induc 'd me rather to communicate the information to you through the medium of the Press than by writing ; that it may meet the eye of many , who will be equally struck and pleas 'd with the novelty of the idea as myself . ”</p>
    <p n="27">I have on this part of the subject , only , after quoting thus much at present from the Letter of Mr. SWAN , to add , that I entirely agree with him , I believe , as to the force , clearness , and comprehensiveness of intellect manifested by this experiment , and its success .</p>
    <p n="28">I now pass to part of what has been fully and excellently said by Dr. DRAKE of HADLEIGH , while investigating the merits of this astonishing Rural Poem .</p>
    <p n="29">In a Letter from HADLEIGH [ Footnote : 9 March , 1800 . ] Dr. DRAKE had given me this distinct and vivid representation of his general idea of the Poem .</p>
    <p n="30">“ I have read THE FARMER 'S BOY with a mixture of astonishment and delight . There is a pathetic simplicity in his sentiments and descriptions that does honour to his head and heart . ”</p>
    <p n="31">“ His copies from Nature are truly original and faithful , and are touched with the hand of a Master .... His versification occasionally displays an energy and harmony which might decorate even the pages of a DARWIN . ”</p>
    <p n="32">“ The general characteristics of his Style , however , are sweetness and ease . In short , I have no hesitation in declaring , that I think it , as a Rural and descriptive Poem , superior to any production since the days of THOMSON . ”</p>
    <p n="33">“ It wants no reference to its Author 's uneducated poverty to render its excellence the more striking ; they are such as would confer durable Fame on the first and most polish 'd Poet in the Kingdom . ”</p>
    <p n="34">I shall now take the liberty of extracting part of the CRITIQUE which Dr. DRAKE , agreeably to his intimation to me , has made of the FARMER 'S BOY in his LITTERARY HOURS . [ Footnote : Vol . II , Ess . xxxix , p . 444 . ]</p>
    <p n="35">“ From the pleasing duty of describing such a ‘ character ’ ( meaning the personal character of Mr. BLOOMFIELD ) let us now turn our attention to the species of composition of which his Poem is so perfect a specimen . It has been observ 'd in my sixteenth number that PASTORAL POETRY in this country , with very few exceptions , has exhibited a tame and servile adherence to classical imagery and costume ; at the same time totally overlooking that profusion of picturesque beauty , and that originality of manner and peculiarity of employment , which our climate and our rustics every where present . ”</p>
    <p n="36">“ A few Authors were mention 'd in that Essay as having judiciously deviated from the customary plan : to these may now be added the name of Boomfield ; the Farmers Boy , though not assuming the form of an Eclogue , being peculiarly and exclusively , throughout , a pastoral Composition ; not like the Poem of Thomson , taking a wide excursion through all the phenomena of the Seasons , but nearly limited to the rural occupation and business of the fields , the dairy , and the farm yard . ”</p>
    <p n="37">“ As with these employments , however , the vicissitudes of the Year are immediately and necessarily connected , Mr. Bloomfield has , with propriety , divided his Poem into Four Books , affixing to those Books the Titles of the Seasons . ”</p>
    <p n="38">“ Such indeed are the merits of this Work , that in true pastoral imagery and simplicity I do not think any production can be put in competition with it since the days of Theocritus . ” [ Footnote : I have heard that the opinion of no less a Judge than Dr. WATSON , Bishop of LLANDAFF , is by no means short of the encomium implied in this comparison , high and ample as it is . L .]</p>
    <p n="39">“ To that charming simplicity which particularizes the Grecian , are added the individuality , [ Footnote : Much of these qualities indeed is certainly in Theocritus also . L .] fidelity , and boldness of description , which render Thomson so interesting to the lovers of Nature . ”</p>
    <p n="40">“ GESNER possesses the most engaging sentiment , and the most refin 'd simplicity of manners ; but he wants that rustic wildness and naïveté in delineation characteristic of the Sicilian , and of the composition before us . ”</p>
    <p n="41">“ WARNER and DRAYTON have much to recommend them : but they are very unequal ; and are devoid of the sweet and pensive morality which pervade almost every page of the Farmers Boy ; nor can they establish any pretensions to that fecundity in painting the oeconomy of rural life , which this Poem , drawn from actual experience , so richly displays . ”</p>
    <p n="42">“ It is astonishing indeed what various and striking circumstances , peculiar to the occupation of the British Farmer , and which are adapted to all the purposes of the pastoral Muse , had escaped our Poets , previous to the publication of Mr. Bloomfield 's Work . ”</p>
    <p n="43">“ Those who are partial to the Country ;— and where is the man of Genius who feels not a delight approaching to ecstasy from the contemplation of its scenery , and the happiness which its cultivation diffuses ?— those who have paid attention to the process of husbandry , and who view its occurrences with interest ; who are at the same time alive to all the minutiae of the animal and vegetable creation ; who mark</p>
    <p n="44">‘ How Nature paints for colours , how the Bee Sits on the bloom , extracting liquid sweet , ’</p>
    <p n="45">will derive from the study of this Poem a gratification the most permanent and pure . ”</p>
    <p n="46">Though I have thus largely extracted I cannot omit transferring hither the ANALYSIS of the Poem , as given by Dr. Drake .</p>
    <p n="47">“ The first Book , intitled Spring , opens with an appropriate invocation . A transition is then made to the artless character of Giles , the Farmer 's Boy ; after which the scene near Euston in Suffolk is describ 'd , and an amiable portrait of Mr. Austin , immediately follows .</p>
    <p n="48">“ Seed-time , harrowing , the devastation of the rooks , [ Footnote : I will not say much : but I was glad to see since the second Edition of this Poem the cause of the Rooks had again been advocated , in the Newcastle Chronicle . L .] wood-scenery , the melody of birds , cows milking , and the operations of the dairy , occupy the chief part of this Season : which is clos 'd by a beautiful Personification of the Spring and her attendants , and an admirable delineation of the sportive pleasures of the young Lambs . ”</p>
    <p n="49">“ The second Book , or Summer , commences with a characteristic sketch of the prudent yet benevolent Farmer . The genial influence of the rain is then welcom 'd ; to which succeeds a most delicious picture of a green and woody covert with all its insect tribe . The ascension of the sky-lark , the peaceful repose of Giles , a view of the ripening harvest , with some moral reflections on Nature and her great Creator , are introduc 'd : follow 'd by animated descriptions of reaping , gleaning , the honest exultation of the Farmer , the beauty of the Country Girl , and the wholesome refreshment of the field . Animals teazed by insects , the cruelty of docking horses , the insolence of the gander , the apathy of the swine , are drawn in a striking manner : and the Book concludes with masterly pictures of a twilight repose , a midnight storm of thunder and lightning , and views of the ancient and present mode of celebrating Harvest-home . ”</p>
    <p n="50">“ The third Book , Autumn , is introduc 'd with a delineation of forest scenery , and pigs fattening on fallen acorns . Sketches of wild ducks and their haunts , of hogs settling to repose in a wood , and of wheat sowing , succeed . The sound of village bells suggests a most pleasing digression : of which the church and its pastor , the rustic amusements of a Sunday , the Village Maids , and a most pathetic description of a distracted Female , are the prominent features . Returning to rural business , Giles is drawn guarding the rising wheat from birds :— his little hut , with his preparation for the reception of his playmates , their treachery and his disappointment , are conceiv 'd and colour 'd in an exquisite style . Fox-hunting , the Fox-hound 's epitaph , the long autumnal evenings , a description of domestic fowl , and a welcome to the snowy nights of Winter , form the concluding topics of this Season . ”</p>
    <p n="51">“ The fourth Book , under the appellation of Winter , is usher 'd in by some humane injunctions for the treatment of storm-pinch 'd cattle . The frozen turnips are broken for them : and the cowyard at night is describ 'd . The conviviality of a Christmas evening , and the conversation round the fire , with the admonitions from the Master 's chair , are depicted in a manner truly pleasing . The Sea Boy and the Farmers Boy are contrasted with much effect : and the ploughman feeding his horses at night , with the comparison between the cart-horse and post-horse , have great merit . The mastiff turn 'd sheep-biter is next delineated ; succeeded by a description of a moon-light night , and the appearance of a spectre . ”</p>
    <p n="52">“ The counting of the Sheep in the fold , and the adopted Lambs , are beautiful paintings : and with the Triumph of GILES on the conclusion of the Year , and his Address to the DEITY , the Book and Poem close . ”</p>
    <p n="53">“ Such are the Materials of which THE FARMER 'S BOY is constructed . Several of the topics , it will be perceiv 'd , are new to Poetry ; and of those which are in their title familiar to the readers of our descriptive Bards , it will be found that the imagery and adjunctive circumstances are original , and the effort of a mind practis 'd in the rare art of selecting and combining the most striking and picturesque features of an object . ”</p>
    <p n="54">Dr. Drake after this well accounts for the poetic singularity that the Poetry of Thomson should have past through a mind so enthusiastically enamor 'd of it , without impairing the originality of its character , when exercis 'd on a subject so much leading to imitation . This he explains , and justly , by the vivid impressions on a most sensible and powerful imagination in his earliest youth , anterior to the study of any Poet .</p>
    <p n="55">Dr. Drake expresses his astonishment at the VERSIFICATION and DICTION of this Poem . And says most truly , “ I am well aware that smooth and flowing lines are of easy purchase , and the property of almost every poetaster of the day : but the versification of Mr. Bloomfield is of another character ; it displays beauties of the most positive kind , and those witcheries of expression which are only to be acquir 'd by the united efforts of Genius and Study . ”</p>
    <p n="56">“ The general characteristics of his versification are facility and sweetness ; that ease which is , in fact , the result of unremitted labour , and one of the most valuable acquisitions of litterature . It displays occasionally likewise a vigour and a brilliancy of polish that might endure comparison with the high-wrought texture of the Muse of DARWIN . From the nature of his subject , however , this splendid mode of decoration could be us 'd but with a sparing hand : and it is not one of his least merits that his diction and harmony should so admirably correspond with the scene which he has chosen . ”</p>
    <p n="57">“ To excel , ” Dr. DRAKE continues , “ in rural IMAGERY , it is necessary that the Poet should diligently study Nature for himself ; and not peruse her as is but too common , ‘ through the spectacles of Books ’ [ Footnote : The happy illustration of DRYDEN in his admirable character of SHAKESPERE . ] He should trace her in all her windings , in her deepest recesses , in all her varied forms . It was thus that LUCRETIUS and VIRGIL , that THOMSON and COWPER were enabled to unfold their scenery with such distinctness and truth : and on this plan , while wandering through his native fields , attentive to ‘ each rural sight , each rural sound , ’ has Mr. BLOOMFIELD built his charming Poem . ”</p>
    <p n="58">“ It is a Work which proves how inexhaustible the features of the World we inhabit : how from objects which the mass of mankind is daily accustom 'd to pass with indifference and neglect . GENIUS can still produce pictures the most fascinating , and of the most interesting tendency . For it is not to imagery alone , though such as here depicted might ensure the meed of Fame , that the Farmer 's Boy will owe its value with us and with posterity . A Morality the most pathetic and pure , the feelings of a heart alive to all the tenderest duties of humanity and religion , consecrate its glowing landscapes , and shed an interest over them , a spirit of devotion , that calm and rational delight which the goodness and greatness of the Creator ought ever to inspire . ”</p>
    <p n="59">Dr. DRAKE confirms , by copious and very judicious Extracts from the various parts of the Poem , as they offer themselves to critical selection , in accompanying the Farmer 's Boy through the Circle of his year , the Judgment which he has form 'd with so much ability , taste , and feeling , and has to agreeably express 'd , of the Merits of our ENGLISH GEORGIC . And he speaks in his third and last Essay on it thus :</p>
    <p n="60">“ From the review we have now taken of THE FARMER 'S BOY , it will be evident , I think , that owing to its harmony and sweetness of versification , its benevolence of sentiment , and originality of imagery , it is entitled to rank very high in the class of descriptive and pastoral Poetry . ”</p>
    <p n="61">He concludes with an highly animated and feeling anticipation of that public attention to the Poem and to its Author , merited in every view , and which already has manifested itself in such an extent .</p>
    <p n="62">I understand there is a Paper on “ The Farmer 's Boy ” in a Work lately publish 'd by Dr. ANDERSON ; and assuredly from its subject well entitled to attention , as well as from the abilities and public spirit of its Editor ;— AGRICULTURAL RECREATIONS . Where indeed with more appropriate Honor could such a Poem be notic 'd ?</p>
    <p n="63">In the Critical Remarks I intended I find myself so much agreeing in sentiment with Dr. Drake that I shall attempt little more than merely to offer some few observations . One of these relates to the coincidences of thought and manner in the Farmer 's Boy with other writings . These , as would previously be expected from what has been said , are extremely few indeed . And almost all that are particularly of moment in appreciating the poetical excellences of the Work are most truly coincidences , and cannot be otherwise consider 'd .</p>
    <p n="64">For the first of these which I shall mention I am indebted to WILLIAM SMITH , Esq . of BURY , who had largely his share of Public Admiration , when he sustain 'd for many years with great skill and judgment , and great natural advantages , almost every character of our Drama which had been eminently favor 'd by either Muse ; and who now enjoys retirement with honor and merited esteem .</p>
    <p n="65">He mention 'd to me in conversation , and since by Letter , a passage very closely resembling one in the IDYLLIA of AUSONIUS . It is this in Spring .</p>
    <p n="66">Like the torn flower the fair assemblage fly . Ah , fallen Rose ! sad emblem of their doom ; Frail as thyself , they perish while they bloom ! I. v . 388-40 .</p>
    <p n="67">The passage to which Mr. Smith referr 'd me is this . ( It is not in my Edition of Ausonius ; but he sent me a Copy . )</p>
    <p n="68">“ Conquerimur , Natura , brevis quod Gratia florum est ; Ostentara oculis illico dona rapis . Quam longa una dies aetas tarn longa rosarum , Ques pubescentes juncta senecta pressit . ”</p>
    <p n="69">ID . xiv .</p>
    <p n="70">I am favor 'd with a Translation made by Mr. SMITH in his very early days . And hope that as a brother Etonian he allows me to quote it .</p>
    <p n="71">Nature , we grieve that thou giv'st flowers so gay , Then snatchest Gifts thou shew'st so swift away . A Day 's a Rose 's Life .— How quickly meet , Sweet Flower , thy Blossom and thy Winding sheet !</p>
    <p n="72">In the Procession of SPRING there is a fine series of allegorical Images .</p>
    <p n="73">Advancing SPRING profusely spreads abroad Flowers of kinds , with sweetest fragrance stor 'd : Where she treads LOVE gladdens every plain ; Delight on tip-toe beats her lucid train ; Sweet Hope with conscious brow before her flies , Anticipating wealth from summer skies .</p>
    <p n="74">I. v. 271 — 6 .</p>
    <p n="75">Compare now this of LUCRETIUS .</p>
    <p n="76">It VER et VENUS et Veneris praenuntius ante Prunatus graditur Zephyrus vestigia propter . FLORA quibus mater praespergens , ante viai Cuncta coloribus egregiis et odoribus opplet .</p>
    <p n="77">DE NAT . RES . L. V. v. 736-9 . Ed . Brindley 1749 .</p>
    <p n="78">There SPRING , and VENUS , and her Harbinger , Near to her moves the winged Zephyrus , For whom maternal FLORA strews the way With Flowers of every charming scent and hue .</p>
    <p n="79">Or in the very words of BLOOMFIELD ,</p>
    <p n="80">Flowers of all hues with sweetest fragrance stor 'd .</p>
    <p n="81">Hope here occupies the place of Zephyrus . DELIGHT on tip-toe supporting the lucid train of Spring ,— the image and attitude so full of life and beauty ,— is our Poet 's own . And what Poet , what Painter , would not have been proud of it ?</p>
    <p n="82">In another passage ,</p>
    <p n="83">The splendid raiment of the Spring peeps forth Her universal Green —</p>
    <p n="84">This of Lucretius will be found to have much similitude :</p>
    <p n="85">Camposque per omnes Florida fulserunt viridami prata colore .</p>
    <p n="86">782 , 3 .</p>
    <p n="87">O'er every plain The flowery meadows beam with verdant hue .</p>
    <p n="88">And that exceedingly fine verse ,</p>
    <p n="89">All Nature feels her venorating sway ,</p>
    <p n="90">calls to mind the ever-memorable exordium of the Roman Poet .</p>
    <p n="91">If we admire the imitative force of this line in the epic majesty of Virgilian numbers ,</p>
    <p n="92">Quadrupedante putrem sonitu qualit ungula campum :</p>
    <p n="93">Shakes the resounding hoof the trembling plain :</p>
    <p n="94">shall we not admire the imitative harmony of this ; attun 'd certainly with not less felicity to the sweetness of the pastoral reed ,</p>
    <p n="95">The green turf trembling as they bound along .</p>
    <p n="96">The pause on the first syllable of the verse has been an admir 'd beauty in Homer and Milton .</p>
    <p n="97">[ Greek : Nux ech d'espchsen enchos . ] II .</p>
    <p n="98">And over them triumphant Death his dart Shook , but delay 'd to strike . P. L .</p>
    <p n="99">We have this beauty ,— coinciding with the best examples , though underiv 'd from them ,— in a cadence of most pathetic softness .</p>
    <p n="100">Joys which the gay companions of her prime Sip , as they drift along the stream of time .</p>
    <p n="101">III . v. 169 , 70 .</p>
    <p n="102">The beautiful Description of the Swine and Pigs feeding on fallen Acorns reminds me of a most picturesque one , not now at hand , in GILPIN on Forest Scenery .</p>
    <p n="103">The turn of this thought ,</p>
    <p n="104">Say not , I 'll come and cheer thy gloomy cell .</p>
    <p n="105">III . v. 241 , &amp; c .</p>
    <p n="106">I believe is from Scripture . Prov . iii . 28 . And so I think certainly is that ,</p>
    <p n="107">‘ Till Folly 's wages , wounds and thorns , they reap .</p>
    <p n="108">III . 37 .</p>
    <p n="109">But the most remarkable of all , and where I had no expectation of finding a similitude , is in near the close of the Winter .</p>
    <p n="110">Far yet above these wafted clouds are seen ( In a remoter sky yet more serene ) Others , detach 'd in ranges through the air , Spotless as snow , and countless as they 're fair ; Scatter 'd immensely wide from east to west , The beauteous semblance of a Flock at rest .</p>
    <p n="111">IV . 255 — 60 .</p>
    <p n="112">In HERCULES the LION-SLAYER there is this passage :</p>
    <p n="113">........

    <p n="116">........ On came the comely sheep , From feed returning to their pens and fold . And these the Kine , in multitudes , succeed ; One on the other rising to the eye ; As watery CLOUDS which in the Heavens are seen , Driven by the south or Thracian Boreas , And , numberless , along the sky they glide : Nor cease ; so many doth the powerful Blast Speed foremost , and so many , fleece on fleece , Successive rise , reflecting varied light So still the herds of Kine successive drew A far extended line : and fill 'd the plain , And all the pathways , with the coming troop .</p>
    <p n="117">I may possibly enlarge these Remarks in a future Edition . At present I am happy to be stopt here , by so good a cause as the urgency of the Publishers to complete a Third Edition ; they informing me that the second is entirely out of print . But it is pleasant to see these Coincidences with CLASSIC POETS of other days and Nations in a CLASSIC of our own , of the best School :</p>
