    <head>A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">By Clement C. Moore .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">Twas the night before Christmas , when all through the house</l>
     <l n="3">Not a creature was stirring , not even a mouse ;</l>
     <l n="4">The stockings were hung by the chimney with care ,</l>
     <l n="5">In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there ;</l>
     <l n="6">The children were nestled all snug in their beds ,</l>
     <l n="7">While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads ;</l>
     <l n="8">And mamma in her kerchief , and I in my cap ,</l>
     <l n="9">Had just settled our brains for a long winter 's nap —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="10">[ Illustration ]</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="11">When out on the lawn there rose such a clatter ,</l>
     <l n="12">I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter ,</l>
     <l n="13">Away to the window I flew like a flash ,</l>
     <l n="14">Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash .</l>
     <l n="15">The moon , on the breast of the new-fallen snow ,</l>
     <l n="16">Gave a lustre of mid-day to objects below ;</l>
     <l n="17">When , what to my wondering eyes should appear ,</l>
     <l n="18">But a miniature sleigh , and eight tiny rein-deer ,</l>
     <l n="19">With a little old driver , so lively and quick ,</l>
     <l n="20">I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick .</l>
     <l n="21">More rapid than eagles his coursers they came ,</l>
     <l n="22">And he whistled , and shouted , and called them by name ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="23">[ Illustration ]</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="24">“ Now , Dasher ! now , Dancer ! now , Prancer and Vixen !</l>
     <l n="25">On ! Comet , on ! Cupid , on ! Dunder and Blitzen —</l>
     <l n="26">To the top of the porch , to the top of the wall !</l>
     <l n="27">Now , dash away , dash away , dash away all ! ”</l>
     <l n="28">As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly ,</l>
     <l n="29">When they meet with an obstacle , mount to the sky ,</l>
     <l n="30">So , up to the house-top the coursers they flew ,</l>
     <l n="31">With a sleigh full of toys — and St. Nicholas too .</l>
     <l n="32">And then in a twinkling I heard on the roof ,</l>
     <l n="33">The prancing and pawing of each little hoof .</l>
     <l n="34">As I drew in my head , and was turning around ,</l>
     <l n="35">Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="36">He was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot ,</l>
     <l n="37">And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot ;</l>
     <l n="38">A bundle of toys he had flung on his back ,</l>
     <l n="39">And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack ;</l>
     <l n="40">His eyes how they twinkled ! his dimples how merry !</l>
     <l n="41">His cheeks were like roses , his nose like a cherry ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="42">[ Illustration ]</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="43">His droll little month was drawn up like a bow ,</l>
     <l n="44">And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow ;</l>
     <l n="45">The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth ,</l>
     <l n="46">And the smoke , it encircled his head like a wreath .</l>
     <l n="47">He had a broad face , and a little round belly</l>
     <l n="48">That shook when he laughed , like a bowl full of jelly .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="49">[ Illustration ]</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="50">He was chubby and plump — a right jolly old elf ;</l>
     <l n="51">And I laughed when I saw him in spite of myself .</l>
     <l n="52">A wink of his eye , and a twist of his head ,</l>
     <l n="53">Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread .</l>
     <l n="54">He spoke not a word , but went straight to his work ,</l>
     <l n="55">And filled all the stockings ; then turned with a jerk ,</l>
     <l n="56">And laying his finger aside of his nose ,</l>
     <l n="57">And giving a nod , up the chimney he rose .</l>
     <l n="58">He sprang to his sleigh , to his team gave a whistle ,</l>
     <l n="59">And away they all flew like the down of a thistle ;</l>
     <l n="60">But I heard him exclaim , ere he drove out of sight ,</l>
     <l n="61">“ Merry Christmas to all , and to all a good night ! ”</l>
