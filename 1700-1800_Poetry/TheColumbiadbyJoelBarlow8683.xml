    <head>Preface .</head>
    <p n="1">In preparing this work for publication it seems proper to offer some observations explanatory of its design . The classical reader will perceive the obstacles which necessarily presented themselves in reconciling the nature of the subject with such a manner of treating it as should appear the most poetical , and at the same time the most likely to arrive at that degree of dignity and usefulness to which it ought to aspire .</p>
    <p n="2">The Columbiad is a patriotic poem ; the subject is national and historical . Thus far it must be interesting to my countrymen . But most of the events were so recent , so important and so well known , as to render them inflexible to the hand of fiction . The poem therefore could not with propriety be modelled after that regular epic form which the more splendid works of this kind have taken , and on which their success is supposed in a great measure to depend . The attempt would have been highly injudicious ; it must have diminished and debased a series of actions which were really great in themselves , and could not be disfigured without losing their interest .</p>
    <p n="3">I shall enter into no discussion on the nature of the epopea , nor attempt to prove by any latitude of reasoning that I have written an Epic Poem . The subject indeed is vast ; far superior to any one of those on which the celebrated poems of this description have been constructed ; and I have no doubt but the form I have given to the work is the best that the subject would admit . It may be added that in no poem are the unities of time , place and action more rigidly observed : the action , in the technical sense of the word , consisting only of what takes place between Columbus and Hesper ; which must be supposed to occupy but few hours , and is confined to the prison and the mount of vision .</p>
    <p n="4">But these circumstances of classical regularity are of little consideration in estimating the real merit of any work of this nature . Its merit must depend on the importance of the action , the disposition of the parts , the invention and application of incidents , the propriety of the illustrations , the liveliness and chastity of the images , the suitable intervention of machinery , the moral tendency of the manners , the strength and sublimity of the sentiments ; the whole being clothed in language whose energy , harmony and elegance shall constitute a style every where suited to the matter they have to treat . It is impossible for me to determine how far I may have succeeded in any of these particulars . This must be decided by others , the result of whose decision I shall never know . But there is one point of view in which I wish the reader to place the character of my work , before he pronounces on its merit : I mean its political tendency . There are two distinct objects to be kept in view in the conduct of a narrative poem ; the poetical object and the moral object . The poetical is the fictitious design of the action ; the moral is the real design of the poem .</p>
    <p n="5">In the Iliad of Homer the poetical object is to kindle , nourish , sustain and allay the anger of Achilles . This end is constantly kept in view ; and the action proper to attain it is conducted with wonderful judgment thro a long series of incidents , which elevate the mind of the reader , and excite not only a veneration for the creative powers of the poet , but an ardent emulation of his heroes , a desire to imitate and rival some of the great actors in the splendid scene ; perhaps to endeavor to carry into real life the fictions with which we are so much enchanted .</p>
    <p n="6">Such a high degree of interest excited by the first object above mentioned , the fictitious design of the action , would make it extremely important that the second object , the real design of the poem , should be beneficial to society . But the real design in the Iliad was directly the reverse . Its obvious tendency was to inflame the minds of young readers with an enthusiastic ardor for military fame ; to inculcate the pernicious doctrine of the divine right of kings ; to teach both prince and people that military plunder was the most honorable mode of acquiring property ; and that conquest , violence and war were the best employment of nations , the most glorious prerogative of bodily strength and of cultivated mind .</p>
    <p n="7">How much of the fatal policy of states , and of the miseries and degradations of social man , have been occasioned by the false notions of honor inspired by the works of Homer , it is not easy to ascertain . The probability is , that however astonishing they are as monuments of human intellect , and how long soever they have been the subject of universal praise , they have unhappily done more harm than good . My veneration for his genius is equal to that of his most idolatrous readers ; but my reflections on the history of human errors have forced upon me the opinion that his existence has really proved one of the signal misfortunes of mankind .</p>
    <p n="8">The moral tendency of the Eneid of Virgil is nearly as pernicious as that of the works of Homer . Its poetical or fictitious design , the settlement of his hero in Italy , is well delineated and steadily pursued . This object must have been far more interesting to the Romans than the anger of Achilles could have been to the Greeks . Had Virgil written his poem one or two centuries earlier than he did , while his countrymen felt that they had a country and were not themselves the property of a master , they must have glowed with enthusiasm in reciting the fabulous labors of their ancestors , and adored the songster who could have thus elevated so endearing a subject ; who could have adorned it with such an interesting variety of incidents , such weight of pathos , such majesty of sentiment and harmony of verse . But Virgil wrote and felt like a subject , not like a citizen . The real design of his poem was to increase the veneration of the people for a master , whoever he might be , and to encourage like Homer the great system of military depredation .</p>
    <p n="9">Lucan is the only republican among the ancient epic poets . But the action of his rambling tho majestic poem is so badly arranged as to destroy , in a poetical sense , the life and interest of the great national subject on which it is founded ; at the same time that it abounds in the most exalted sentiments and original views of manners , highly favorable to the love of justice and the detestation of war . If a mind , formed like that of Lucan , as to its moral and political cast , and endowed with the creative energy of Homer , had sung to the early Greeks the fall of Troy or the labors of Hercules , his work ( taking the place which those of Homer have unfortunately occupied ) as a splendid model for all succeeding ages , would have given a very different turn to the pursuits of heroes and the policy of nations . Ambition might then have become a useful passion , instead of a destructive disease .</p>
    <p n="10">In the poem here presented to the public the objects , as in other works of the kind , are two , the fictitious object of the action and the real object of the poem . The first of these is to sooth and satisfy the desponding mind of Columbus ; to show him that his labors , tho ill rewarded by his cotemporaries , had not been performed in vain ; that he had opened the way to the most extensive career of civilization and public happiness ; and that he would one day be recognised as the author of the greatest benefits to the human race . This object is steadily kept in view ; and the actions , images and sentiments are so disposed as probably to attain the end . But the real object of the poem embraces a larger scope ; it is to inculcate the love of rational liberty , and to discountenance the deleterious passion for violence and war ; to show that on the basis of the republican principle all good morals , as well as good government and hopes of permanent peace , must be founded ; and to convince the student in political science , that the theoretical question of the future advancement of human society , till states as well as individuals arrive at universal civilization , is held in dispute and still unsettled only because we have had too little experience of organized liberty in the government of nations to have well considered its effects .</p>
    <p n="11">I cannot expect that every reader , nor even every republican reader , will join me in opinion with respect to the future progress of society and the civilization of states ; but there are two sentiments in which I think all men will agree : that the event is desirable , and that to believe it practicable is one step towards rendering it so . This being the case , they ought to pardon a writer , if not applaud him , for endeavoring to inculcate this belief .</p>
   </div>
   <titlePage>
    <docImprint>I have taken the liberty , notwithstanding the recency of the events , to make some changes in the order of several of the principal battles described in this poem . I have associated the actions of Starke , Herkimer , Brown and Francis in the battle of Saratoga , tho they happened at some distance from that battle , both as to time and place . A like circumstance will be noticed with respect to Sumter , Jackson of Georgia and some others in the battle of Eutaw . I have supposed a citadel mined and blown up in the siege of York , and two ships of war grappled and blown up in the naval battle of Degrasse and Graves . It is presumed that these circumstances require no apology ; as in the two latter cases the events are incidental to such situations , and they here serve the principal purpose , being meant to increase our natural horror for the havoc and miseries of war in general . And with regard to the two former cases we ought to consider that , in the epic field , the interest to be excited by the action cannot be sustained by following the gazette , as Lucan has done . The desultory parts of the historical action must be brought together and be made to elevate and strengthen each other , so as to press upon the mind with the full force of their symmetry and unity . Where the events are recent and the actors known , the only duty imposed by that circumstance on the poet is to do them historical justice , and not ascribe to one hero the actions of another . But the scales of justice in this case are not necessarily accompanied by the calendar and the map . It will occur to most of my readers that the modern modes of fighting , as likewise the instruments and terms now used in war , are not yet rendered familiar in poetical language . It is doubtless from an unwarrantable timidity , or want of confidence in their own powers of description , that modern poets have made so little use of this kind of riches that lay before them . I confess that I imbibed the common prejudice , and remained a long time in the error of supposing that the ancients had a poetical advantage over us in respect to the dignity of the names of the weapons used in war , if not in their number and variety . And when I published a sketch of the present poem , under the title of The Vision of Columbus , I labored under the embarrassment of that idea . I am now convinced that the advantage , at least as to the weapons , is on the side of the moderns . There are better sounding names and more variety in the instruments , works , stratagems and other artifices employed in our war system than in theirs . In short , the modern military dictionary is more copious than the ancient , and the words at least as poetical . As to the mode of fighting , we have , poetically speaking , lost something in one respect , but we have gained much in another . Our battles indeed admit but few single combats , or trials of individual prowess . They do admit them however ; and it is not impossible to describe them with as much detail and interest as the nature of the action requires ; as Voltaire has proved in the single combat of Aumale and Turenne in the Henriad . Had he managed his general descriptions and the other parts of the conduct of his poem as well , he would have made it a far more interesting work than he has . However , since our single combats must be insignificant in their consequences , not deciding any thing as to the result of the battle , it would be inconvenient and misplaced to make much use of them in our descriptions . And here lies our disadvantage , compared with the ancients . But in a general engagement , the shock of modern armies is , beyond comparison , more magnificent , more sonorous and more discoloring to the face of nature , than the ancient could have been ; and is consequently susceptible of more pomp and variety of description . Our heaven and earth are not only shaken and tormented with greater noise , but filled and suffocated with fire and smoke . If Homer , with his Grecian tongue and all its dialects , had had the battle of Blenheim to describe , the world would have possessed a picture and a piece of music which now it will never possess . The description would have astonished all ages , and enriched every language into which it might have been translated . With regard to naval battles the moderns have altogether the advantage . But there has been no naval battle described in modern poetry ; neither is there any remaining to us from the ancients , except that in the bay of Marseilles by Lucan , and that near Syracuse by Silius . It would seem strange indeed that Homer , whose wonderful powers of fiction were not embarrassed by historical realities , and who in other respects is so insatiable of variety , did not introduce a sea fight either in the defence of Troy , or in the disastrous voyages of Ulysses . But the want of this in Homer 's two poems amounts almost to a proof that in his time the nations had not yet adopted any method of fighting at sea ; so that the poet could have no such image in his mind . The business of war , with all its varieties , makes but a small part of the subject of my poem ; it ought therefore to occupy but a small portion of its scenery . This is the reason why I have not been more solicitous to vary and heighten the descriptions of battles and other military operations . I make this observation to satisfy those readers who being accustomed to see a long poem chiefly occupied with this sort of bustle conceive that the life and interest of such compositions depend upon it . How far the majesty or interest of epic song really depends upon the tumultuous conflicts of war I will not decide ; but I can assure the reader , so far as my experience goes , that these parts of the work are not the most difficult to write . They are scenes that exhibit those vigorous traits of human character which strike the beholder most forcibly and leave the deepest impression . They delight in violent attitudes ; and , painting themselves in the strongest colors on the poet 's fancy , they are easy at any time to recal . He varies them at pleasure , he adorns them readily with incidents , and imparts them with spirit to the reader . My object is altogether of a moral and political nature I wish to encourage and strengthen in the rising generation , a sense of the importance of republican institutions ; as being the great foundation of public and private happiness , the necessary aliment of future and permanent ameliorations in the condition of human nature . This is the moment in<country>America</country>to give such a direction to poetry , painting and the other fine arts , that true and useful ideas of glory may be implanted in the minds of men here , to take place of the false and destructive ones that have degraded the species in other countries ; impressions which have become so wrought into their most sacred institutions , that it is there thought impious to detect them and dangerous to root them out , tho acknowledged to be false . Wo be to the republican principle and to all the institutions it supports , when once the pernicious doctrine of the holiness of error shall creep into the creed of our schools and distort the intellect of our citizens !</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>The Columbiad , in its present form , is such as I shall probably leave it to its fate . Whether it be destined to survive its author , is a question that gives me no other concern than what arises from the most pure and ardent desire of doing good to my country .

    <head>Introduction .</head>
    <p n="12">Every circumstance relating to the discovery and settlement of America is an interesting object of inquiry , especially to the great and growing nations of this hemisphere , who owe their existence to those arduous labors . Yet it is presumed that many persons , who might be entertained with a poem on this subject , are but slightly acquainted with the life and character of the hero whose extraordinary genius led him to discover the continent , and whose singular sufferings , arising from that service , ought to excite the indignation of the world .</p>
    <p n="13">Christopher Columbus was born in Genoa about the year 1447 , when the navigation of Europe was scarcely extended beyond the limits of the Mediterranean and the other narrow seas that border the great ocean . The mariner 's compass had been invented and in common use for more than a century ; yet with the help of this sure guide , and prompted by a laudable spirit of discovery , the mariners of those days rarely ventured from the sight of land .</p>
    <p n="14">They acquired wonderful applause by sailing along the coast of Africa , and discovering some of the neighboring islands ; and after pushing their researches with great industry for half a century , the Portuguese , who were the most fortunate and enterprising , extended their voyages southward no farther than the equator .</p>
    <p n="15">The rich commodities of the East had , for several ages , been brought into Europe by the Red Sea and the Mediterranean ; and it had now become the object of the Portuguese to find a passage to India by sailing round the southern extremity of Africa , and then taking an eastern course . This great object engaged the general attention , and drew into the Portuguese service adventurers from the other maritime nations of Europe . Every year added to their experience in navigation , and seemed to promise some distant reward to their industry . The prospect however of arriving at India by that route was still by no means encouraging . Fifty years perseverance in the same track having brought them only to the equator , it was probable that as many more would elapse before they could accomplish their purpose .</p>
    <p n="16">But Columbus , by an uncommon exertion of genius , formed a design no less astonishing to the age in which he lived than beneficial to posterity . This design was to sail to India by taking a western direction . By the accounts of travellers who had visited that part of Asia , it seemed almost without limits on the east ; and by attending to the spherical figure of the earth Columbus drew the natural conclusion , that the Atlantic ocean must be bounded on the west either by India itself , or by some continent not far distant from it .</p>
    <p n="17">This illustrious navigator , who was then about twenty-seven years of age , appears to have possessed every talent requisite to form and execute the greatest enterprises . He was early educated in such of the useful sciences as were taught in that day . He had made great proficiency in geography , astronomy and drawing , as they were necessary to his favorite pursuit of navigation . He had been a number of years in the service of the Portuguese , and had acquired all the experience that their voyages and discoveries could afford . His courage had been put to the severest test ; and the exercise of every amiable as well as heroic virtue , the kindred qualities of a great mind , had secured him an extensive reputation . He had married a Portuguese lady , by whom he had two sons , Diego and Ferdinand ; the younger of these is the historian of his life .</p>
    <p n="18">Such was the situation of Columbus , when he formed and digested a plan , which , in its operation and consequences , has unfolded to the view of mankind one half of the globe , diffused wealth and industry over the other , and is extending commerce and civilization thro the whole . To corroborate the theory he had formed of the existence of a western continent , his discerning mind , which knew the application of every circumstance that fell in his way , had observed several facts which by others would have passed unnoticed . In his voyages to the African islands he had found , floating ashore after a long western storm , pieces of wood carved in a curious manner , canes of a size unknown in that quarter of the world , and human bodies with very singular features .</p>
    <p n="19">The opinion being well established in his mind that a considerable portion of the earth still remained to be discovered , his temper was too vigorous and persevering to suffer an idea of this importance to rest merely in speculation , as it had done with Plato and Seneca , who seem to have entertained conjectures of a similar nature . He determined therefore to bring his theory to the test of experiment . But an object of that magnitude required the patronage of a prince ; and a design so extraordinary met with all the obstructions that an age of superstition could invent , and personal jealousy enhance .</p>
    <p n="20">It is happy for mankind that , in this instance , a genius capable of devising the greatest undertakings associated in itself a degree of patience and enterprise , modesty and confidence , which rendered him superior to these misfortunes , and enabled him to meet with fortitude all the future calamities of his life . Excited by an ardent enthusiasm to become a discoverer of new countries , and fully sensible of the advantages that would result to mankind from such discoveries , he had the cruel mortification to wear away eighteen years of his life , after his system was well established in his own mind , before he could obtain the means of executing his projected voyage . The greatest part of this period was spent in successive solicitations in Genoa , Portugal and Spain .</p>
    <p n="21">As a duty to his native country he made his first proposal to the senate of Genoa , where it was soon rejected . Conscious of the truth of his theory , and of his own abilities to execute his plan , he retired without dejection from a body of men who were incapable of forming any just ideas upon the subject , and applied with fresh confidence to John Second , king of Portugal ; who had distinguished himself as the great patron of navigation , and in whose service Columbus had acquired a reputation which entitled him and his project to general confidence . But here he experienced a treatment much more insulting than a direct refusal . After referring the examination of his scheme to the council who had the direction of naval affairs , and drawing from him his general ideas of the length of the voyage and the course he meant to take , that splendid monarch had the meanness to conspire with this council to rob Columbus of the glory and advantage he expected to derive from his undertaking . While Columbus was amused with the negotiation , in hopes of having his scheme adopted , a vessel was secretly dispatched by order of the king to make the intended discovery . Want of skill or courage in the pilot rendered the plot unsuccessful ; and Columbus , on discovering the treachery , retired with an ingenuous indignation from a court which could be capable of such duplicity .</p>
    <p n="22">Having now performed what was due to the country that gave him birth , and to the one that had adopted him as a subject , he was at liberty to court the patronage of any other which should have the wisdom to accept his proposals . He had communicated his ideas to his brother Bartholomew , whom he sent to England to negotiate with Henry Seventh ; at the same time he went himself into Spain to apply in person to Ferdinand and Isabella , who governed the united kingdoms of Arragon and Castile .</p>
    <p n="23">The circumstances of his brother 's application in England , which appears to have been unsuccessful , are not to my purpose to relate ; and the limits prescribed to this biographical sketch will prevent the detail of particulars respecting his own negotiation in Spain . This occupied him eight years ; in which the various agitations of suspense , expectation and disappointment must have borne hard upon his patience . At length his scheme was adopted by Isabella ; who undertook , as queen of Castile , to defray the expenses of the expedition , and declared herself ever after the friend and patron of the hero who projected it .</p>
    <p n="24">Columbus , who during his ill success in the negotiation never abated any thing of the honors and emoluments which he expected to acquire in the expedition , obtained from Ferdinand and Isabella a stipulation of every article contained in his first proposals . He was constituted high admiral and viceroy of all the seas , islands and continents which he should discover ; with power to receive one tenth of the profits arising from their productions and commerce . Which offices and emoluments were to be made hereditary in his family .</p>
    <p n="25">These articles being adjusted , the preparations for the voyage were brought forward with rapidity ; but they were by no means adequate to the importance of the expedition . Three small vessels , scarcely sufficient in size to be employed in the coasting business , were appointed to traverse the vast Atlantic , and to encounter the storms and currents always to be expected in tropical climates , uncertain seasons and unknown seas . These vessels , as we must suppose them in the infancy of navigation , were ill constructed , in a poor condition , and manned by seamen unaccustomed to distant voyages . But the tedious length of time which Columbus had passed in solicitation and suspense , and the prospect of being able soon to obtain the object of his wishes , induced him to overlook what he could not easily remedy ; and led him to disregard those circumstances which would have intimidated any other mind . He accordingly equipped his small squadron with as much expedition as possible , manned with ninety men and victualled for one year . With these , on the third of August 1492 , amidst a vast crowd of spectators , he set sail on an enterprise which , if we consider the ill condition of his ships , the inexperience of his sailors , the length and precarious nature of his voyage , and the consequences that flowed from it , was the most daring and important that ever was undertaken . He touched at some of the Portuguese settlements in the Canary Isles ; where , altho he had been but a few days at sea , he found his vessels needed refitting . He soon made the necessary repairs , and took his departure from the westermost islands that had hitherto been discovered . Here he left the former track of navigation , and steered his course due west . Not many days after he laid this course he perceived the symptoms of a new scene of difficulty . The sailors now began to contemplate the dangers and uncertain issue of a voyage , the nature and length of which were left entirely open to conjecture . Besides the fickleness and timidity natural to men unaccustomed to the discipline of a seafaring life , several circumstances contributed to inspire an obstinate and mutinous disposition ; which required the most consummate art as well as fortitude in the admiral to control . Having been three weeks at sea , and experienced the uniform course of the trade winds , they contended that , should they continue the same course for a longer time , the same winds would never permit them to return to Spain . The magnetic needle began to vary its direction . This being the first time that this phenomenon was ever noticed , it was viewed by the sailors with astonishment ; they thought it an indication that nature itself had changed its laws , and that Providence was about to punish their audacity in venturing so far beyond the bounds of man . They declared that the commands of the government had been fully obeyed in their proceeding so many days in the same course , and so far surpassing all former navigators in quest of discoveries .</p>
    <p n="26">Every talent requisite for governing , soothing and tempering the passions of men is conspicuous in the conduct of Columbus on this occasion . The dignity and affability of his manners , his surprising knowledge and experience in naval affairs , his unwearied and minute attention to the duties of his command , gave him a great ascendency over the minds of his men , and inspired that degree of confidence which would have maintained his authority in almost any circumstances . But here , from the nature of the undertaking , every man had leisure to feed his imagination with the gloominess and uncertainty of the prospect . They found from day to day the same steady gales wafting them with rapidity from their native country , and indeed from all countries of which they had any knowledge .</p>
    <p n="27">He addressed himself to their passions with all the variety of management that the situation would admit , sometimes by soothing them with the prognostics of approaching land , sometimes by flattering their ambition and feasting their avarice with the glory and wealth they would acquire from discovering the rich countries beyond the Atlantic , and sometimes by threatening them with the displeasure of their king , should their disobedience defeat so great an object . But every argument soon lost its effect ; and their uneasiness still increased . From secret whisperings it arose to open mutiny and dangerous conspiracy . At length they determined to rid themselves of the remonstrances of Columbus by throwing him into the sea . The infection spread from ship to ship , and involved officers as well as sailors . They finally lost all sense of subordination and addressed their commander in an insolent manner , demanding to be conducted immediately back to Spain ; or , they assured him , they would seek their own safety by taking away his life .</p>
    <p n="28">Columbus , whose sagacity had discerned every symptom of the disorder , was prepared for this last stage of it ; and was sufficiently apprized of the danger that awaited him . He found it vain to contend with passions he could no longer control . He therefore proposed that they should obey his orders for three days longer ; and should they not discover land in that time , he would then direct his course for Spain . They complied with his proposal ; and , happily for mankind , in three days they discovered land . This was a small island , to which he gave the name of San Salvador . His first interview with the natives was a scene of compassion on the one part and astonishment on the other , but highly interesting to both . The natives were entirely naked , simple and timorous ; and they viewed the Spaniards as a superior order of beings descended from the sun ; which , in that island and in most parts of America , was worshipped as a Deity . By this it was easy for Columbus to perceive the line of conduct proper to be observed toward that simple and inoffensive people . Had his companions and successors of the Spanish nation possessed the wisdom and humanity of this great discoverer , the benevolent mind would have had to experience no sensations of regret in contemplating the extensive advantages arising to mankind from the discovery of America .</p>
    <p n="29">In this voyage Columbus discovered the islands of Cuba and Hispaniola , on the latter of which he erected a small fort ; and having left a garrison of thirty-eight men he set sail for Spain . Returning across the Atlantic , he was overtaken by a violent storm , which lasted several days , and increased to such a degree as baffled his naval skill and threatened immediate destruction . In this situation when all were in a state of despair , and it was expected that every sea would swallow up the crazy vessel , he manifested a serenity and presence of mind seldom equalled in cases of like extremity . He wrote a short account of his voyage and of the discoveries he had made ; this he hastily wrapt in an oiled cloth , then enclosed it in a cake of wax and put it into an empty cask , which he threw overboard , in hopes that some fortunate accident might preserve a deposit of so much importance to the world .</p>
    <p n="30">The storm however abated , and he at length arrived in Spain , after having been driven by stress of weather into the port of Lisbon ; where he had opportunity , in an interview with the king of Portugal , to prove the truth of his system by arguments more convincing than those he had before advanced in the character of a bold projector but humble suitor . He was received every where in Spain with royal honors ; his family was ennobled , and his former stipulation respecting his offices and emoluments was ratified in the most solemn manner by Ferdinand and Isabella ; while all Europe resounded his praises , and reciprocated their joy and congratulations on the discovery of what they called a new world .</p>
    <p n="31">The immediate consequence was a second voyage , in which Columbus took charge of a squadron of seventeen ships of considerable burden . Volunteers of all ranks solicited to be employed in this expedition . He carried over fifteen hundred persons , with the necessaries for establishing a colony and extending his discoveries . In this voyage he explored most of the West India islands ; but on his arrival at Hispaniola he found that the garrison he had left there had been all destroyed by the natives , and the fort demolished . He proceeded however in the planting of his colony ; and by his prudent and humane conduct towards the natives he effectually established the Spanish authority in that island . But while he was thus laying the foundation of European dominion in America , some discontented persons , who had returned to Spain , uniting with his former opponents and powerful enemies at court , conspired to accomplish his ruin .</p>
    <p n="32">They represented his conduct in such a light as to create uneasiness in the jealous mind of Ferdinand , and make it necessary for Columbus again to return to Spain , to counteract their machinations and obtain such farther supplies as were necessary to his great political and beneficent purposes . On his arriving at court , and stating with his usual dignity and confidence the whole history of his transactions abroad , every thing wore a favorable appearance . He was received with the same honors as before , and solicited to take charge of another squadron , to carry out farther supplies , to pursue his discoveries , and in every respect to use his discretion in extending the Spanish empire in the new world .</p>
    <p n="33">In this third voyage he discovered the continent of America at the mouth of the river Orinoco . He rectified many disorders in his government of Hispaniola , which had happened in his absence ; and every thing was going on in a prosperous train , when an event was announced to him , which completed his own ruin and gave a fatal turn to the Spanish policy and conduct in America . This was the arrival of Francis de Bovadilla , with a commission to supersede Columbus in his government , to arraign him as a criminal , and pronounce judgment on all his former administration .</p>
    <p n="34">It seems that by this time the enemies of Columbus , despairing to complete his overthrow by groundless insinuations of malconduct , had taken the more effectual method of exciting the jealousy of their sovereigns . From the promising samples of gold and other valuable commodities brought from America , they took occasion to represent to the king and queen that the prodigious wealth and extent of the countries he had discovered would soon throw such power into the hands of the viceroy , that he would trample on the royal authority and bid defiance to the Spanish power . These arguments were well calculated for the cold and suspicious temper of Ferdinand ; and they must have had some effect upon the mind of Isabella . The consequence was the appointment of Bovadilla , the inveterate enemy of Columbus , to take the government from his hands . This first tyrant of the Spanish nation in America began his administration by ordering Columbus to be put in chains on board of a ship , and sending him prisoner to Spain . By relaxing all discipline he introduced disorder and licentiousness thro the colony . He subjected the unhappy natives to a most miserable servitude , and apportioned them out in large numbers among his adherents . Under this severe treatment perished in a short time many thousands of those innocent people .</p>
    <p n="35">Columbus was carried in his fetters to the Spanish court , where the king and queen either feigned or felt a sufficient regret at the conduct of Bovadilla towards their illustrious prisoner . He was not only released from confinement ; he was treated with all imaginable respect . But , altho the king endeavored to expiate the offence by censuring and recalling Bovadilla , yet we may judge of his sincerity from his appointing Nicholas de Ovando , another well known enemy of Columbus , to succeed in the government ; and from his ever after refusing to reinstate Columbus , or to fulfil any of the conditions on which the discoveries had been undertaken .</p>
    <p n="36">After two years of solicitation for this or some other employment , he at length obtained a squadron of four small vessels to attempt new discoveries . He then set out , with the enthusiasm of a young adventurer , in quest of what was always his favorite object , a passage into the South Sea , by which he might sail to India . He touched at Hispaniola , where Ovando the governor refused him admittance on shore , even to take shelter during a hurricane , the prognostics of which his experience had taught him to discern . By putting into a creek he rode out the storm , and then bore away for the continent . He spent several months , the most boisterous of the year , in exploring the coast round the gulph of Mexico , in hopes of finding the intended navigation to India . At length he was shipwrecked , and driven ashore on the island of Jamaica .</p>
    <p n="37">His cup of calamities seemed now to be full . He was cast upon an island of savages , without provisions , without a vessel , and thirty leagues from any Spanish settlement . But the greatest physical misfortunes are capable of being embittered by the insults of our fellow creatures . A few of his companions generously offered , in two Indian canoes , to attempt a voyage to Hispaniola , in hopes of obtaining a vessel for the relief of the unhappy crew . After suffering every extremity of danger and fatigue , they arrived at the Spanish colony in ten days . Ovando , excited by personal malice against Columbus , detained these messengers for eight months , and then despatched a vessel to Jamaica to spy out the condition of Columbus and his crew , with positive instructions to the captain not to afford them any relief . This order was punctually executed . The captain approached the shore , delivered a letter of empty compliment from Ovando to the admiral , received his answer and returned . About four months afterwards a vessel came to their relief ; and Columbus , worn out with fatigues and broken by misfortunes , returned for the last time to Spain . Here a new distress awaited him , which he considered as one of the greatest of his whole life : this was the death of queen Isabella , his last and most powerful friend .</p>
    <p n="38">He did not suddenly abandon himself to despair . He called upon the gratitude and justice of the king ; and in terms of dignity demanded the fulfilment of his former contract . Notwithstanding his age and infirmities , he even solicited to be farther employed in extending the career of discovery , without a prospect of any other reward than the pleasure of doing good to mankind . But Ferdinand , cold ungrateful and timid , dared not comply with any proposal of this kind , lest he should increase his own obligations to a man , whose services he thought it dangerous to reward . He therefore delayed and avoided any decision on these subjects , in hopes that the declining health of Columbus would soon rid the court of the remonstrances of a suitor , whose unexampled merit was , in their opinion , a sufficient reason for destroying him . In this they were not disappointed . Columbus languished a short time , and gladly resigned a life which had been worn out in the most signal services perhaps that have been rendered by any one man to an ungrateful world .</p>
    <p n="39">Posterity is sometimes more just to the memory of great men than contemporaries were to their persons . But even this consolation , if it be one , has been wanting to the discoverer of our hemisphere . The continent , instead of bearing his name , has been called after one of his followers , a man of no particular merit . And in the modern city of Mexico there is instituted and perpetuated , by order of government , an annual festival in honour of Hernando Cortez , the perfidious butcher of its ancient race ; while no public honors have been decreed to Christopher Columbus , one of the wisest and best among the benefactors of mankind .</p>
    <p n="40">After his last return from America he seems to have past the short remainder of his life at Valladolid , the capital of Old Castile , and then the seat of the Spanish government . He died in that city on the twentieth of August 1506 , and was buried in one of its churches . Over his body is a plain stone inscribed simply with his name , as it is written in Spanish , CHRISTOVAL COLON .</p>
    <p n="41">His son , who wrote his life , has left us a particular description of his person , manners and private character ; all of which were agreeable and interesting . His portrait is in possession of the author of this poem . It is painted in oil , half length and the size of life , copied from an original picture in the gallery of Florence .</p>

   <p>[ Note : Atlas and Hesper were of the race of Titans . They were sons of Uranus , or of Japetus , according as the fable is traced to different countries , whose supreme God ( originally the sun ) was called by different names . Atlas , from being king of Mauritania , became a mountain to support the heavens , and gave his name to the western ocean . Hesper frequented that mountain in the study of astronomy ; till one evening he disappeared , and returned no more . He was then placed in the western heaven ; and , having been a beautiful young man , he became a beautiful planet , called the evening star . This circumstance gave his name to the western regions of the earth indefinitely . Italy was called Hesperia by the Greeks , because it lay west from them , and seemed under the influence of the star of evening ; Spain was called Hesperia by the Romans , for the same reason .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">If the nations which adopted this fable had known of a country west of the</l>
     <l n="2">Atlantic , that country must have been Hesperia to them all ; and pursuing</l>
     <l n="3">this analogy I have so named it , in several instances , in the course of</l>
     <l n="4">this poem . Considering Hesper as the guardian Genius , and Columbus as the</l>
     <l n="5">Discoverer , of the western continent , it may derive its name , in poetical</l>
     <l n="6">language , from either of theirs indifferently , and be called Hesperia or</l>
     <l n="7">Columbia .</l>

   <p>Natives of America appear in vision . Their manners and characters . Columbus demands the cause of the dissimilarity of men in different countries , Hesper replies , That the human body is composed of a due proportion of the elements suited to the place of its first formation ; that these elements , differently proportioned , produce all the changes of health , sickness , growth and decay ; and may likewise produce any other changes which occasion the diversity of men ; that these elemental proportions are varied , not more by climate than temperature and other local circumstances ; that the mind is likewise in a state of change , and will take its physical character from the body and from external objects : examples . Inquiry concerning the first peopling of America . View of Mexico . Its destruction by Cortez . View of Cusco and Quito , cities of Peru .

He traces their progress from the birth of the universe to the present state of the earth and its inhabitants ; asserts the future advancement of society , till perpetual peace shall be established . Columbus proposes his doubts ; alleges in support of them the successive rise and downfal of ancient nations ; and infers future and periodical convulsions . Hesper , in answer , exhibits the great distinction between the ancient and modern state of the arts and of society . Crusades . Commerce . Hanseatic League . Copernicus . Kepler . Newton , Galileo . Herschel . Descartes . Bacon . Printing Press . Magnetic Needle . Geographical discoveries . Federal system in America . A similar system to be extended over the whole earth .

    <head>Notes .</head>
    <p n="1">Tho it would be more convenient to the reader to find some of these notes , especially the shorter ones , at the bottom of the pages to which they refer , yet most of them are of such a length as would render that mode of placing them disadvantageous to the symmetry of the pages and the general appearance of the work . It seemed necessary that these should be collected at the end of the Poem ; and it was thought proper that the others should not be separated from them .</p>
    <p n="2">The notes will probably be found too voluminous for the taste of some readers ; but others would doubtless be better pleased to see them still augmented , as several of the philosophical subjects and historical references are left unexplained . Were I to offer apologies in this case , I should hardly know on which side to begin . I will therefore only say that in this appendage , as in the body of the work , I have aimed , as well as I was able , at blending in due proportions the useful with the agreeable .</p>
    <p n="3">No . 1 .</p>
    <p n="4">One gentle guardian once could shield the brave ; But now that guardian slumbers in the grave .</p>
    <p n="5">Book I . Line 105 .</p>
    <p n="6">The death of queen Isabella , which happened before the last return of Columbus from America , was a subject of great sorrow to him . In her he lost his only powerful friend in Spain , on whose influence he was accustomed to rely in counteracting the perpetual intrigues of a host of enemies , whose rank and fortune gave them a high standing at the court of Valladolid . Their situation and connexions must havee commanded a weight of authority not easily resisted by an individual foreigner , however illustrious from his merit .</p>
    <p n="7">It was a grievous reflection for Columbus that his services , tho great in themselves and unequalled in their consequences to the world , had been performed in an age and for a nation which knew not their value , as well as for an ungrateful monarch who chose to disregard them .</p>
    <p n="8">No . 2 .</p>

    <p n="10">Book I . Line 243 .</p>
    <p n="11">The original inhabitants of Hispaniola were worshippers of the sun . The Europeans , when they first landed there , were supposed by them to be gods , and consequently descended from the sun . See the subject of solar worship treated more at large in a subsequent note .</p>

    <p n="15">The White Mountain of Newhampshire , tho eighty miles from the sea , is the first land to be discovered in approaching that part of the coast of North America . It serves as a landmark for a considerable length of coast , of difficult navigation .</p>
    <p n="16">No . 4 .</p>
    <p n="17">Whirl 'd from the monstrous Andes ’ bursting sides , Maragnon leads his congregating tides ;</p>
    <p n="18">Book I . Line 365 .</p>
    <p n="19">This river , from different circumstances , has obtained several different names . It has been called Amazon , from an idea that some part of the neighboring country was inhabited by a race of warlike women , resembling what Herodotus relates of the Amazons of Scythia . It has been called Orellana , from its having been discovered by a Spanish officer of that name , who , on a certain expedition , deserted from the younger Pizarro on one of the sources of this river , and navigated it from thence to the ocean . Maragnon is the original name given it by the natives ; which name I choose to follow .</p>
    <p n="20">If we estimate its magnitude by the length of its course and the quantity of water it throws into the sea , it is much the greatest river that has hitherto come to our knowledge . Its navigation is said by Condamine and others to be uninterrupted for four thousand miles from the sea . Its breadth , within the banks , is sixty geographical miles ; it receives in its course a variety of great rivers , besides those described in the text . Many of these descend from elevated countries and mountains covered with snow , the melting of which annually swells the Maragnon above its banks ; when it overflows and fertilizes a vast extent of territory .</p>

    <p n="23">Book I . Line 435 .</p>
    <p n="24">Some of the richest diamond mines are found on the banks of the lake Xaraya . The river Paraguay is remarkable for the quantities of gold dust found in its channel . The Rio de la Plata , properly so called , has its source in the mountains of Potosi ; and it was probably from this circumstance that it received its name , which signifies River of Silver . This river , after having joined the Paraguay , which is larger than itself , retains its own name till it reaches the sea . Near the mouth , it is one hundred and fifty miles wide ; but in other respects it is far inferior to the Maragnon .</p>

    <p n="27">Book I . Line 449 .</p>
    <p n="28">The great object of Columbus , in most of his voyages , was to discover a western passage to India . He navigated the Gulph of Mexico with particular attention to this object , and was much disappointed in not finding a pass into the South Sea . The view he is here supposed to have of that ocean would therefore naturally recal his former desire of sailing to India .</p>

    <p n="34">Say , Palfrey , brave good man , was this thy doom ? Dwells here the secret of thy midsea tomb ?</p>
    <p n="35">Book I . Line 627 .</p>
    <p n="36">Colonel Palfrey of Boston was an officer of distinction in the American army during the war of independence . Soon after the war he proposed to visit Europe , and embarked for England ; but never more was heard of . The ship probably perished in the ice .

    <p n="40">The color of animals is acquired partly from the food they eat , thro successive generations , and partly from the objects with which they are usually surrounded . Dr. Darwin has a curious note on this subject , in which he remarks on the advantages that insects and other small animals derive from their color , as a means of rendering them invisible to their more powerful enemies ; who thus find it difficult to distinguish them from other objects where they reside . Some animals which inhabit cold countries turn white in winter , when the earth is covered with snow ; such as the snowbird of the Alps . Others in snowy regions are habitually white ; such as the white bear of Russia .</p>

    <p n="44">Paria is a fertile country near the river Orinoco ; the only part of the continent of America that Columbus had seen . Tombut , in the same latitude , is the most sterile part of Africa . America embraces a greater compass of latitude by many degrees than the other continent ; and yet its inhabitants present a much less variety in their physical and moral character .

    <p n="48">Without entering into any discussion on the theory of heat and cold ( a point not yet settled in our academies ) I would just observe , in vindication of the expression in the text , that some solid matter , such for instance as the surface of the earth , seems absolutely necessary to the production of heat . At least it must be a matter more compact than that of the sun 's rays ; and perhaps its power of producing heat is in proportion to its solidity .</p>
    <p n="49">The warmth communicated to the atmosphere is doubtless produced by the combined causes of the earth and the sun ; but the agency of the former is probably more powerful in this operation than that of the latter , and its presence more indispensable . For masses of matter will produce heat by friction , without the aid of the sun ; but no experiment has yet proved that the rays of the sun are capable of producing heat without the aid of other and more solid matter . The air is temperate in those cavities of the earth where the sun is the most effectually excluded ; whereas the coldest regions yet known to us are the tops of the Andes , where the sun 's rays have the most direct operation , being the most vertical and the least obstructed by vapors . Those regions are deprived of heat by being so far removed from the broad surface of the earth ; a body that appears requisite to warm the surrounding atmosphere by its cooperation with the action of the sun .</p>
    <p n="50">From these principles we may conclude that cultivation , in a woody country , tends to warm the atmosphere and ameliorate a cold climate ; as , by removing the forests and marshes , it opens the earth to the sun , and allows them to act in conjunction upon the air .</p>
    <p n="51">According to the descriptions given of the middle parts of Europe by Cesar and Tacitus , it appears that those countries were much colder in their days than they are at present ; cultivation seems to have softened that climate to a great degree . The same effect begins to be perceived in North America . Possibly it may in time become as apparent as the present difference in the temperature of the two continents .</p>

    <p n="58">Book II . Line 287 .</p>
    <p n="59">We may reckon three stages of improvement in the graphic art , or the art of communicating our thoughts to absent persons and to posterity by visible signs . First , The invention of painting ideas , or representing actions , dates and other circumstances of historical fact , by the images of material things , drawn usually on a flat surface , or sometimes carved or moulded in a more solid form . This was the state at which the art had arrived in Egypt before the introduction of letters , and in Mexico before the arrival of the Spaniards . The Greeks in Egypt called it hieroglyphic .</p>
    <p n="60">Second , The invention of painting sounds , which we do by the use of letters , or the alphabet , and which we call writing . This was a vast improvement ; as it simplified in a wonderful degree the communication of thought . For ideas are infinite in number and variety ; while the simple sounds we use to convey them to the ear are few , distinct and easy to be understood . It would indeed be impossible to express all our ideas by distinct and visible images . And even if the writer were able to do this , not many readers could be made to understand him ; since it would be necessary that every new idea should have a new image invented and agreed upon between the writer and the reader , before it could be used . Which preliminary could not be settled without the writer should see and converse with the reader . And he might as well , in this case , convey his ideas by oral speech ; so that his writing could be of little use beyond a certain routine of established signs .</p>
    <p n="61">The number of simple sounds in human language , used in discourse , is not above eighteen or twenty ; and these are so varied in the succession in which they are uttered , as to express an inconceivable and endless variety of thought and sentiment . Then , by the help of an alphabet of about twenty-six letters or visible signs , these sounds are translated from the ear to the eye ; and we are able , by thus painting the sound , to arrest its fleeting nature , render it permanent , and talk with distant nations and future ages , without any previous convention whatever , even supposing them to be ignorant of the language in which we write . This is the present state of the art , as commonly practised in all the countries where an alphabet is used . It is called the art of writing ; and to understand it is called reading .</p>
    <p n="62">Third , Another invention , which is still in its infancy , is the art of painting phrases , or sentences ; commonly called shorthand writing . This is yet but little used , and only by a few dexterous persons , who make it a particular study . Probably the true principles on which it ought to be founded are yet to be discovered . But it may be presumed , that in this part of the graphic art there remains to the ingenuity of future generations a course of improvements totally inconceivable to the present ; by which the whole train of impressions now made upon the mind by reading a long and well written treatise may be conveyed by a few strokes of the pen , and be received at a glance of the eye . This desideratum would be an abridgment of labor in our mental acquisitions , of which we cannot determine the consequences . It might make , in the progress of human knowledge , an epoch as remarkable as that which was made by the invention of alphabetical writing , and produce as great a change in the mode of transmitting the history of events .</p>
    <p n="63">One consequence of the invention of alphabetical writing seems to have been to throw into oblivion all previous historical facts ; and it has thus left an immense void , which the imagination knows not how to fill , in contemplating the progress of our race . How many important discoveries , which still remain to our use , must have taken their origin in that space of time which is thus left a void to us ! A vast succession of ages , and ages of improvement , must have preceded ( for example ) the invention of the wheel . The wheel must have been in common use , we know not how long , before alphabetical writing ; because we find its image employed in painting ideas , during the first stage of the graphic art above described . The wheel was likewise in use before the mysteries of Ceres or those of Isis were established ; as is evident from its being imagined as an instrument of punishment in hell , in the case of Ixion , as represented in those mysteries . The taming of the ox and the horse , the use of the sickle and the bow and arrow , a considerable knowledge of astronomy , and its application to the purposes of agriculture and navigation , with many other circumstances , which show a prodigious improvement , must evidently have preceded the date of the zodiac ; a date fixed by Dupuis , with a great degree of probability , at about seventeen thousand years from our time . This epoch would doubtless carry us back many thousand years beyond that of the alphabet ; the invention of which was sufficient of itself to obliterate the details of previous history , as the event has proved .</p>
    <p n="64">How far the loss of these historical details is to be regretted , as an impediment to our progress in useful knowledge , I will not decide ; but in one view , which I am going to state , it may be justly considered as a misfortune .</p>
    <p n="65">The art of painting ideas , being arrested in the state in which the use of the alphabet found it , went into general disuse for common purposes ; and the works then extant , as well as the knowledge of writing in that mode , being no longer intelligible to the people , became objects of deep and laborious study , and known only to the learned ; that is , to the men of leisure and contemplation . These men consequently ran it into mystery ; making it a holy object , above the reach of vulgar inquiry . On this ground they established , in the course of ages , a profitable function or profession , in the practice of which a certain portion of men of the brightest talents could make a reputable living ; taking care not to initiate more than a limited number of professors ; no more than the people could maintain as priests . This mode of writing then assumed the name of hieroglyphic , or sacred painting , to distinguish it from that which had now become the vulgar mode of writing , by the use of the alphabet . This is perhaps the source of that ancient , vast and variegated system of false religion , with all its host of errors and miseries , which has so long and so grievously weighed upon the character of human nature .</p>
    <p n="66">In noticing the distinction of the three stages in the graphic art above described , I have not mentioned the wonderful powers we derive from it in the language of the mathematics and the language of music . In each of these , though its effects are already astonishing , there is no doubt but great improvements are still to be made . Our present mode of writing in these , as in literature , belongs to the second or alphabetical stage of the graphic art . The ten ciphers , and the other signs used in the mathematical sciences , form the alphabet in which the language of those sciences is written . The few musical notes , and the other signs which accompany them , furnish an alphabet for writing the language of music .</p>
    <p n="67">The mode of writing in China is still different from any of those I have mentioned . The Chinese neither paint ideas nor sounds : but they make a character for every word ; which character must vary according to the different inflections and uses of that word . The characters must therefore be insupportably numerous , and be still increasing as the language is enriched with new words by the augmentation and correction of ideas .</p>
    <p n="68">The English language is supposed to contain about twelve thousand distinct words , and the Italian about seventeen thousand , in the present state of our sciences . I know not how many the Chinese may contain ; but if we were to write our languages in the Chinese method , it would be the business of a whole life for a man to learn his mother tongue , so as to read and write it for his ordinary purposes .</p>
    <p n="69">As the Chinese have not adopted an alphabet , but have adhered to an invariable state of the graphic art , which is probably more ancient by several thousand years than our present method , may we not venture to conjecture that the traces of their very ancient history have been , for that reason , better preserved ? and that their pretensions to a very high antiquity , which we have been used to think extravagant and ridiculous , are really not without foundation ? If so , we might then allow a little more latitude to ourselves , and conclude that we are in fact as old as they , and might have been as sensible of it , if we had adhered to our ancient method of writing ; and not changed it for a new one which , while it has facilitated the progress of our science , has humbled our pride of antiquity , by obliterating the dates of those labors and improvements of our early progenitors , to which we are indebted for more of the rudiments of our sciences and our arts than we usually imagine .</p>
    <p n="70">It is much to be regretted , that the Spanish devastation in Mexico and Peru was so universal as to leave us but few monuments of the history of the human mind in those countries , which presented a state of manners so remarkably different from what can be found in any other part of the world . The pictorial writing of the Mexicans , tho sometimes called hieroglyphic , does not appear to merit that name , as it was not exclusively appropriated by the priests to sacred purposes . Indeed it could not be so appropriated till a more convenient method could be discovered and adopted for common purposes . For a thing cannot become sacred , in this sense of the word , until it ceases to be common .</p>

He constructed a fort , in which the iron and the rigging were preserved .</p>

    <p n="82">Book II . Line 421 .</p>
    <p n="83">It is worthy of remark , that the countries where the worship of the sun has made the greatest figure are Egypt and Peru ; the two regions of the earth the most habitually deprived of rain , and probably of clouds , which in other countries so frequently obstruct his rays and seem to dispute his influence . Tho in the rude ages of society it is certainly natural in all countries to pay adoration to the sun , as one of the visible agents of those changes in the atmosphere which most affect the people 's happiness , yet it is reasonable to suppose that this adoration would be more unmixed , and consequently more durable , in climates where the agency of the sun appears unrivalled and supreme .</p>
    <p n="84">On the supposition that Greece and Western Asia , regions whose early traditions are best known to us , derived their first theological ideas from Egypt , it is curious to observe how the pure heliosebia of Egypt degenerated in those climates in proportion as other visible agents seemed to exert their influence in human affairs . Greece is a mountainous country , subject to a great deal of lightning and other meteors , whose effects are tremendous and make stronger impressions on rude savages than the gentle energies of the sun .</p>
    <p n="85">The Greeks therefore , having forgotten the source of their religious system , ceased to consider the sun as their supreme god ; his agency being , in their opinion , subject to a more potent divinity , the Power of the air or Jupiter , whom they styled the Thunderer . So that Apollo , the god of light , became , in their mythology , the subject and offspring of the supreme god of the atmosphere . This religion became extremely confused and complicated with new fables , according to the temperature and other accidents of the different climates thro which it passed . The god of thunder obtained the supreme veneration generally in Europe : known in the south by the name of Jupiter or Zeus and in the north by that of Thor .</p>
    <p n="86">Europe in general has an uneven surface and a vapory sky , liable to great concussions in the lower regions of the atmosphere which border the habitation of man . There is no wonder that in such a region the god of the air should appear more powerful than the god of light . This disposition of the elements has given a gloomy cast to the mind , and in the north more than in the south . The Thor of the Celtic nations was more tremendous , more feared and less beloved , than the Jupiter of the Greeks and Romans ; he was worshipped accordingly with more bloody sacrifices . But in all Europe , Western Asia and the northwestern coast of Africa , where the earth is uneven and the climate variable , their religion was more gloomy and their gods more ferocious than among the ancient Egyptians .</p>
    <p n="87">A like difference is observed in the religions of the two countries in America where civilization was most advanced before the arrival of the Spaniards . Peru enjoyed a climate of great serenity and regularity . Of all the sensible agents that operated on the earth and air , the sun was apparently the most uniform and energetic . The worship of the sun was therefore the most predominant and durable ; and it inspired a mildness of manners analogous to his mild and beneficent influence . In Mexico and other uneven countries , where storms and earthquakes were frequent , the sun , altho he was reckoned among their deities , was not considered so powerful as those of a more boisterous and maleficent nature . The Mexican worship was therefore addressed chiefly to ferocious beings , enemies to human happiness , who delighted in the tears and blood of their votaries . The difference in the moral cast of religion in Peru and Mexico , as well as in Egypt and Greece , must have been greatly owing to climate . Indeed in what else should it be found ? since the origin of religious ideas must have been in the energies of those visible agents which form the distinctive character of climates .</p>

    <p n="89">Long is the tale ; but tho their labors rest By years obscured , in flowery fiction drest ,</p>
    <p n="90">Book II . Line 455 .</p>
    <p n="91">The traditions respecting these founders of the Peruvian empire are indeed obscure ; but they excite in us the same sort of veneration that we feel for the most amiable and distinguished characters of remote antiquity . The honest zeal of Garcilasso de la Vega in collecting these traditions into one body of history , as a probable series of facts , is to be applauded ; since he has there presented us with one of the most striking examples of the beau ideal in political character , that can be found in the whole range of literature . He treats his subject with more natural simplicity , tho with less talent , than Plutarch or Xenophon , when they undertake a similar task , that of drawing traditional characters to fill up the middle space between fable and history .</p>
    <p n="92">With regard to the true position that the portrait of Manco Capac ought to hold in this middle space , how near it should stand to history and how near to fable , we should find it difficult to say , and perhaps useless to inquire . Plutarch has gravely given us the lives and actions of several heroes who are evidently more fabulous than Capac , and of others who should be placed on the same line with him . The existence of Theseus , Romulus and Numa is more doubtful and their actions less probable than his . The character of Capac , in regard to its reality , stands on a parallel with that of the Lycurgus of Plutarch and the Cyrus of Xenophon ; not purely historical nor purely fabulous , but presented to us as a compendium of those talents and labors which might possibly be crowded into the capacity of one mind , and be achieved in one life , but which more probably belong to several generations ; the talents and labors that could reduce a great number of ferocious tribes into one peaceable and industrious state .</p>
    <p n="93">Garcilasso was himself an Inca by maternal descent , born and educated at Cusco after the Spanish conquest . He writes apparently with the most scrupulous regard to truth , with little judgment and no ornament . He discovers a credulous zeal to throw a lustre on his remote ancestor Manco Capac , not by inventing new incidents , but by collecting with great industry all that had been recorded in the annals of the family . And their manner of recording events , tho not so perfect as that of writing , was not so liable to error as traditions merely oral , like those of the Caledonian and other Celtic bards , with respect to the ancient heroes of their countries .</p>
    <p n="94">His account states , that about four centuries previous to the discovery of that country by the Spaniards , the natives of Peru were as rude savages as any in America . They had no fixed habitations , no ideas of permanent property ; they wandered naked like the beasts , and like them depended on the events of each day for a subsistence . At this period Manco Capac and his wife Mauna Oella appeared on a small island in the lake Titiaca , near which the city of Cusco was afterwards built . These persons , to establish a belief of their divinity in the minds of the people , were clothed in white garments of cotton , and declared themselves descended from the sun , who was their father and the god of that country . They affirmed that he was offended at their cruel and perpetual wars , their barbarous modes of worship , and their neglecting to make the best use of the blessings he was constantly bestowing , in fertilizing the earth and producing vegetation ; that he pitied their wretched state , and had sent his own children to instruct them and to establish a number of wise regulations , by which they might be rendered happy .</p>
    <p n="95">By some uncommon method of persuasion , these persons drew together a few of the savage tribes , laid the foundation of the city of Cusco , and established what is called the kingdom of the Sun , or the Peruvian empire . In the reign of Manco Capac , the dominion was extended about eight leagues from the city ; and at the end of four centuries it was established fifteen hundred miles on the coast of the Pacific ocean , and from that ocean to the Andes . During this period , thro a succession of twelve monarchs , the original constitution , established by the first Inca , remained unaltered ; and this constitution , with the empire itself , was at last overturned by an accident which no human wisdom could foresee or prevent .</p>
    <p n="96">For a more particular detail of the character and institutions of this extraordinary personage the reader is referred to a subsequent note , in which he will find a dissertation on that subject .</p>
    <p n="97">In the passage preceding this reference , I have alluded to the fabulous traditions relating to these children of the sun . In the remainder of the second and thro the whole of the third book , I have given what may be supposed a probable narrative of their real origin and actions . The space allowed to this episode may appear too considerable in a poem whose principal object is so different . But it may be useful to exhibit in action the manners and sentiments of savage tribes , whose aliment is war ; that the contrast may show more forcibly the advantages of civilized life , whose aliment is peace .</p>

    <p n="101">As the art of spinning is said to have been invented by Oella , it is no improbable fiction to imagine that they first assumed these white garments of cotton as an emblem of the sun , in order to inspire that reverence for their persons which was necessary to their success .

    <p n="103">DISSERTATION ON THE INSTITUTIONS OF MANCO CAPAC .</p>
    <p n="104">For the end of Book II .</p>
    <p n="105">Altho the original inhabitants of America in general deserve to be classed among the most unimproved savages that had been , discovered before those of New Holland , yet the Mexican and Peruvian governments exhibited remarkable exceptions , and seemed to be fast approaching to a state of civilization . In the difference of national character between the people of these two empires we may discern the influence of political systems on the human mind , and infer the importance of the task which a legislator undertakes , in attempting to reduce a barbarous people under the control of government and laws .</p>
    <p n="106">The Mexican constitution was formed to render its subjects brave and powerful ; but , while it succeeded in this object , it kept them far removed from the real blessings of society . According to the Spanish accounts ( which for an obvious reason may however be suspected of exaggeration ) the manners of the Mexicans were uncommonly ferocious , and their religion gloomy , sanguinary , and unrelenting . But the establishments of Manco Capac , if we may follow Garcilasso in attributing the whole of the Peruvian constitution to that wonderful personage , present the aspect of a most benevolent and pacific system ; they tended to humanize the world and render his people happy ; while his ideas of deity were so elevated as to bear a comparison with the sublime doctrines of Socrates or Plato .</p>
    <p n="107">The characters , whether real or fabulous , who are the most distinguished as lawgivers among barbarous nations , are Moses , Lycurgus , Solon , Numa , Mahomet , and Peter of Russia . Of these , only the two former and the two latter appear really to deserve the character of lawgivers . Solon and Numa possessed not the opportunity of showing their talents in the work of original legislation . Athens and Rome were considerably civilized before these persons arose . The most they could do was to correct and amend constitutions already formed . Solon may be considered as a wise politician , but by no means as the founder of a nation . The Athenians were too far advanced in society to admit any radical change in their form of government ; unless recourse could have been had to the representative system , by establishing an equality of rank , and instructing all the people in their duties and their rights ; a system which was never understood by any ancient legislator .</p>
    <p n="108">The institutions of Numa ( if such a person as Numa really existed ) were more effective and durable . His religious ceremonies were , for many ages , the most powerful check on the licentious and turbulent Romans , the greater part of whom were ignorant slaves . By inculcating a remarkable reverence for the gods , and making it necessary to consult the auspices when any thing important was to be transacted , his object was to render the popular superstition subservient to the views of policy , and thus to give the senate a steady check upon the plebeians . But the constitutions of Rome and Athens , notwithstanding the abundant applause that has been bestowed upon them , were never fixed on any permanent principles ; tho the wisdom of some of their rulers , and the spirit of liberty that inspired the citizens , may justly demand our admiration .</p>
    <p n="109">Each of the other legislators above mentioned deserves a particular consideration , as having acted in stations somewhat similar to that of the Peruvian patriarch . Three objects are to be attended to by the legislator of a barbarous people : First , That his system be such as is capable of reducing the greatest number of men under one jurisdiction : Second , That it apply to such principles in human nature for its support as are universal and permanent , in order to insure the duration of the government : Third , That it admit of improvements correspondent to any advancement in knowledge or variation of circumstances that may happen to its subjects , without endangering the principle of government by such innovations . So far as the systems of such legislators agree with these fundamental principles ; they are worthy of respect ; and so far as they deviate , they may be considered as defective .</p>
    <p n="110">To begin with Moses and Lycurgus : It is proper to observe that , in order to judge of the merit of any institutions , we must take into view the peculiar character of the people for whom they were framed . For want of this attention , many of the laws of Moses and some of those of Lycurgus have been ridiculed and censured . The Jews , when led by Moses out of Egypt , were not only uncivilized , but having just risen to independence from a state of servitude they united the manners of servants and savages ; and their national character was a compound of servility , ignorance , filthiness and cruelty . Of their cruelty as a people we need no other proof than the account of their avengers of blood , and the readiness with which the whole congregation turned executioners , and stoned to death the devoted offenders . The leprosy , a disease now scarcely known , was undoubtedly produced by a want of cleanliness continued for successive generations . In this view , their frequent ablutions , their peculiar modes of trial and several other institutions , may be vindicated from ridicule and proved to be wise regulations .</p>
    <p n="111">The Spartan lawgiver has been censured for the toleration of theft and adultery . Among that race of barbarians these habits were too general to admit of total prevention or universal punishment . By vesting all property in the commonwealth , instead of encouraging theft , he removed the possibility of the crime ; and , in a nation where licentiousness was generally indulged , it was a great step towards introducing a purity of manners , to punish adultery in all cases wherein it was committed without the consent of all parties interested in its consequences .</p>
    <p n="112">Until the institution of representative republics , which are of recent date , it was found that those constitutions of government were best calculated for immediate energy and duration , which were interwoven with some religious system . The legislator who appears in the character of an inspired person renders his political institutions sacred , and interests the conscience as well as the judgment in their support . The Jewish lawgiver had this advantage over the Spartan : he appeared not in the character of a mere earthly governor , but as an interpreter of the divine will . By enjoining a religious observance of certain rites he formed his people to habitual obedience ; by directing their cruelty against the breakers of the laws he at least mitigated the rancor of private hatred ; by directing that real property should return to the original families in the year of Jubilee he prevented too great an equality of wealth ; and by selecting a single tribe to be the interpreters of religion he prevented its mysteries from being the subject of profane and vulgar investigation . With a view of securing the permanence of his institutions , he prohibited intercourse with foreigners by severe restrictions , and formed his people to habits and a character disagreeable to other nations ; so that any foreign intercourse was prevented by the mutual hatred of both parties .</p>
    <p n="113">To these institutions the laws of Lycurgus bear a striking resemblance . The features of his constitution were severe and forbidding ; it was however calculated to inspire the most enthusiastic love of liberty and martial honor . In no country was the patriotic passion more energetic than in Sparta ; no laws ever excluded the idea of separate property in an equal degree , or inspired a greater contempt for the manners of other nations . The prohibition of money , commerce and almost every thing desirable to effeminate nations , excluded foreigners from Sparta ; and while it inspired the people with contempt for strangers it made them agreeable to each other . By these means Lycurgus rendered the nation warlike ; and to insure the duration of the government he endeavored to interest the consciences of his people by the aid of oracles , and by the oath he is said to have exacted from them to obey his laws till his return , when he went into perpetual exile .</p>
    <p n="114">From this view of the Jewish and Spartan institutions , applied to the principles before stated , they appear in the two first articles considerably imperfect , and in the last totally defective . Neither of them was calculated to bring any considerable territory or number of men under one jurisdiction : from this circumstance alone they could not be rendered permanent , as nations so restricted in their means of extension must be constantly exposed to their more powerful neighbors . But the third object of legislation , that of providing for the future progress of society , which as it regards the happiness of mankind is the most important of the three , was in both instances entirely neglected . These symptoms appear to have been formed with an express design to prevent future improvement in knowledge or enlargement of the human mind , and to fix those nations in a state of ignorance and barbarism . To vindicate their authors from an imputation of weakness or inattention in this particular , it may be urged that they were each of them surrounded by nations more powerful than their own ; it was therefore perhaps impossible for them to commence an establishment upon any other plan .</p>
    <p n="115">The institutions of Mahomet are next to be considered . The first object of legislation appears to have been better understood by him than by either of the preceding sages ; his jurisdiction was capable of being enlarged to any extent of territory , and governing any number of nations that might be subjugated by his enthusiastic armies ; and his system of religion was admirably calculated to attain this object . Like Moses , he convinced his people that he acted as the vicegerent of God ; but with this advantage , adapting his religion to the natural feelings and propensities of mankind , he multiplied his followers by the allurements of pleasure and the promise of a sensual paradise . These circumstances were likewise sure to render his constitution durable . His religious system was so easy to be understood , so splendid and so inviting , there could be no danger that the people would lose sight of its principles , and no necessity of future prophets to explain its doctrines or reform the nation . To these advantages if we add the exact and rigid military discipline , the splendor and sacredness of the monarch , and that total ignorance among the people which such a system will produce and perpetuate , the establishment must have been evidently calculated for a considerable extent and duration . But the last and most important end of government , that of mental improvement and social happiness , was deplorably lost in the institution . There was probably more learning and cultivated genius in Arabia , in the days of this extraordinary man , than can now be found in all the Mahometan dominions .</p>
    <p n="116">On the contrary , the enterprising mind of the Russian monarch appears to have been wholly bent on the arts of civilization and the improvement of society among his subjects . Established in a legal title to a throne which already commanded a prodigious extent of country , he found the first object of government already secured ; and by applying himself with great sagacity to the third object , that of improving his people , it was reasonable to suppose that the second , the durability of his system , would become a necessary consequence . He effected his purposes , important as they were , merely by the introduction of the arts and the encouragement of politer manners . The greatness of his character appears not so much in his institutions , which he copied from other nations , as in the extraordinary measures he followed to introduce them , the judgment he showed in selecting and adapting them to the genius of his subjects , and the surprising assiduity by which he raised a savage people to an elevated rank among European nations .</p>
    <p n="117">To the nature and operation of the several forms of government above mentioned I will compare that of the Peruvian lawgiver . I have observed in a preceding note that the knowledge we have of Manco Capac is necessarily imperfect and obscure , derived thro traditions and family registers ( without the aid of writing ) for four hundred years ; from the time he is supposed to have lived , till that of his historian and descendant , Inca Garcilasso de la Vega . About an equal interval elapsed from the supposed epoch of the first kings of Rome to that of their first historians ; a longer space from Lycurgus to Herodotus ; probably not a shorter one from the time of the great Cyrus to that of Xenophon , author of the elegant romance on the actions of that hero .</p>
    <p n="118">I recal the reader 's attention to these comparisons , not with a view of contending that our accounts of the actions ascribed to Capac are derived from authentic records , and that he is a subject of real history , like Mahomet or Peter ; but to show that , our channels of information with regard to him being equally respectable with those that have brought us acquainted with the classical and venerable names of Lycurgus , Romulus , Numa and Cyrus , we may be as correct in our reasonings from the modern as from the ancient source of reference , and fancy ourselves treading a ground as sacred on the tomb of the western patriarch , as on those more frequented and less scrutinized in the east , consecrated to the demigods of Sparta , Rome and Persia .</p>
    <p n="119">It is probable that the savages of Peru before the time of Capac , among other objects of adoration , paid homage to the sun . By availing himself of this popular sentiment he appeared , like Moses and Mahomet , in the character of a divine legislator endowed with supernatural powers . After impressing these ideas on the minds of the people , drawing together a number of the tribes and rendering them subservient to his benevolent purposes , he applied himself to forming the outlines of a plan of policy capable of founding and regulating an extensive empire , wisely calculated for long duration , and well adapted to improve the knowledge , peace and happiness of a considerable portion of mankind . In the allotment of the lands as private property he invented a mode somewhat resembling the feudal system of Europe : yet this system was checked in its operation by a law similar to that of Moses which regulated landed possessions in the year of Jubilee . He divided the lands into three parts ; the first was consecrated to the uses of religion , as it was from the sacerdotal part of his system that he doubtless expected its most powerful support . The second portion was set apart for the Inca and his family , to enable him to defray the expenses of government and appear in the style of a monarch . The third and largest portion was allotted to the people ; which allotment was repeated every year , and varied according to the number and exigences of each family .</p>
    <p n="120">As the Incan race appeared in the character of divinities , it seemed necessary that a subordination of rank should be established , to render the distinction between the monarch and his people more perceptible . With this view he created a band of nobles , who were distinguished by personal and hereditary honors . These were united to the monarch by the strongest ties of interest ; in peace they acted as judges and superintended the police of the empire ; in war they commanded in the armies . The next order of men were the respectable landholders and cultivators , who composed the principal strength of the nation . Below these was a class of men who were the servants of the public and cultivated the public lands . They possessed no property , and their security depended on their regular industry and peaceable demeanor . Above all these orders were the Inca and his family . He possessed absolute and uncontrolable power ; his mandates were regarded as the word of heaven , and the double guilt of impiety and rebellion attended on disobedience .</p>
    <p n="121">To impress the utmost veneration for the Incan family , it was a fundamental principle that the royal blood should never be contaminated by any foreign alliance . The mysteries of religion were preserved sacred by the high priest of the royal family under the control of the king , and celebrated with rites capable of making the deepest impression on the multitude . The annual distribution of the lands , while it provided for the varying circumstances of each family , was designed to strengthen the bands of society by perpetuating that distinction of rank among the orders which is supposed necessary to a monarchical government ; the peasants could not vie with their superiors , and the nobles could not be subjected by misfortune to a subordinate station . A constant habit of industry was inculcated upon all ranks by the force of example . The cultivation of the soil , which in most other countries is considered as one of the lowest employments , was here regarded as a divine art . Having had no knowledge of it before , and being taught it by the children of their god , the people viewed it as a sacred privilege , a national honor , to assist the sun in opening the bosom of the earth to produce vegetation . That the government might be able to exercise the endearing acts of beneficence , the produce of the public lands was reserved in magazines , to supply the wants of the unfortunate and as a resource in case of scarcity or invasion .</p>
    <p n="122">These are the outlines of a government the most simple and energetic , and at least as capable as any monarchy within our knowledge of reducing great and populous countries under one jurisdiction ; at the same time , accommodating its principle of action to every stage of improvement , by a singular and happy application to the passions of the human mind , it encouraged the advancement of knowledge without being endangered by success .</p>
    <p n="123">In the traits of character which distinguish this institution we may discern all the great principles of each of the legislators above mentioned . The pretensions of Capac to divine authority were as artfully contrived and as effectual in their consequences as those of Mahomet ; his exploding the worship of evil beings and objects of terror , forbidding human sacrifices and accommodating the rites of worship to a god of justice and benevolence , produced a greater change in the national character of his people than the laws of Moses did in his ; like Peter he provided for the future improvement of society , while his actions were never measured on the contracted scale which limited the genius of Lycurgus .</p>
    <p n="124">Thus far we find that altho the political system of Capac did not embrace that extensive scope of human nature which is necessary in forming republican institutions , and which can be drawn only from long and well recorded experience of the passions and tendencies of social man , yet it must be pronounced at least equal to those of the most celebrated monarchical law-givers , whether ancient or modern . But in some things his mind seems to have attained an elevation with which few of theirs will bear a comparison ; I mean in his religious institutions , and the exalted ideas he had formed of the agency and attributes of supernatural beings .</p>
    <p n="125">From what source he could have drawn these ideas it is difficult to form a satisfactory conjecture . The worship of the sun is so natural to an early state of society , in a mild climate with a clear atmosphere , that it may be as reasonable to suppose it would originate in Peru as in Egypt or Persia ; where we find that a similar worship did originate and was wrought into a splendid system ; whence it was probably extended , with various modifications , over most of the ancient world .</p>
    <p n="126">Or if we reject this theory , and suppose that only one nation , from some circumstance peculiar to itself , could create the materials of such a system , and has consequently had the privilege of giving its religion to the human race ; we may in this case imagine that the Phenicians ( who colonized Cadiz and other places in the west of Europe , at the time when they possessed the solar worship in all its glory ) must have had a vessel driven across the Atlantic ; and thus conveyed a stock of inhabitants , with their own religious ideas , to the western continent .</p>
    <p n="127">The first theory is doubtless the most plausible . And the mild regions of Peru , for the reasons mentioned in a former note , became , like Egypt , the seat of an institution so congenial to its climate . But in more boisterous climates , where storms and other violent agents prevail , many different fables have wrought themselves into the system , as remarked in the same note ; and the solar religion in such countries has generally lost its name and the more beneficent parts of its influence . Being thus corrupted , religion in almost every part of the earth assumed a gloomy and sanguinary character .</p>
    <p n="128">Savage nations create their gods from such materials as they have at hand , the most striking to their senses . And these are in general an assemblage of destructive attributes . They usually form no idea of a general superintending providence ; they consider not their god as the author of their beings , the creator of the world and the dispenser of the happiness they enjoy ; they discern him not in the usual course of nature , in the sunshine and in the shower , the productions of the earth and the blessing of society ; they find a deity only in the storm , the earthquake and the whirlwind , or ascribe to him the evils of pestilence and famine ; they consider him as interposing in wrath to change the course of nature and exercise the attributes of rage and revenge . They adore him with rites suited to these attributes , with horror , with penance and with sacrifice ; they imagine him pleased with the severity of their mortifications , with the oblations of blood and the cries of human victims ; and they hope to compound for greater judgments by voluntary sufferings and horrid sacrifices , suited to the relish of his taste .</p>
    <p n="129">Perhaps no single criterion can be given which will determine more accurately the state of society in any age or nation than their general ideas concerning the nature and attributes of deity . In the most enlightened periods of antiquity , only a few of their philosophers , a Socrates , Tully or Confucius , ever formed a rational idea on the subject , or described a god of purity , justice and benevolence . But Capac , erecting his institutions in a country where the visible agents of nature inspired more satisfactory feelings , adopted a milder system . As the sun , with its undisturbed influence , seemed to point itself out as the supreme controller and vital principle of nature , he formed the idea , as the Egyptians had done before , of constituting that luminary the chief object of adoration . He taught the nation to consider the sun as the parent of the universe , the god of order and regularity ; ascribing to his influence the rotation of the seasons , the productions of the earth and the blessings of health ; especially attributing to his inspiration the wisdom of their laws , and that happy constitution which was the delight and veneration of the people .</p>
    <p n="130">A system so just and benevolent , as might be expected , was attended with success . In about four centuries the dominion of the Incas had extended fifteen hundred miles in length , and had introduced peace and prosperity thro the whole region . The arts of society had been carried to a considerable degree of improvement , and the authority of the Incan race universally acknowledged , when an event happened which disturbed the tranquillity of the empire . Huana Capac , the twelfth monarch , had reduced the powerful kingdom of Quito and annexed it to his dominions . To conciliate the affections of his new subjects , he married a daughter of the ancient king of Quito , who was not of the race of Incas . Thus , by violating a fundamental law of the empire , he left at his death a disputed succession to the throne . Atabalipa , the son of Huana by the heiress of Quito , being in possession of the principal force of the Peruvian armies , left at that place on the death of his father , gave battle to his brother Huascar , who was the elder son of Huana by a lawful wife , and legal heir to the crown .</p>
    <p n="131">After a long and destructive civil war the former was victorious ; and thus was that flourishing kingdom left a prey to regal dissensions and to the few soldiers of Pizarro , who happened at that juncture to make a descent upon the coast . In this manner he effected an easy conquest and an utter destruction of a numerous , brave , unfortunate people .</p>
    <p n="132">It is however obvious that this deplorable event is not to be charged on Capac , as the consequence of any defect in his institution . It is impossible that an original legislator should effectually guard against the folly of all future sovereigns . Capac had not only removed every temptation that could induce a wise prince to wish for a change in the constitution , but had connected the ruin of his authority with the change ; for he who disregards any part of institutions deemed sacred teaches his people to consider the whole as an imposture . Had he made a law ordaining that the Peruvians should be absolved from their allegiance to a prince who should violate the laws , it would have implied possible error and imperfection in those persons whom the people were ordered to regard as divinities ; the reverence due to characters who made such high pretensions would have been weakened ; and instead of rendering the constitution perfect , such a law would have been its greatest defect . Besides , it is probable the rupture might have been healed and the suecession settled , with as little difficulty as frequently happens with partial revolutions in other kingdoms , had not the descent of the Spaniards prevented it . And this event , for that age and country , must have been beyond the possibility of human foresight . But viewing the concurrence of these fatal accidents , which reduced this flourishing empire to a level with many other ruined and departed kingdoms , it only furnishes an additional proof that no political system has yet had the privilege to be perfect .</p>
    <p n="133">On the whole it is evident that the system of Capac ( if the Peruvian constitution may be so called ) is one of the greatest exertions of genius to be found in the history of mankind . When , we consider him as an individual emerging from the midst of a barbarous people , having seen no example of the operation of laws in any country , originating a plan of religion and policy never equalled by the sages of antiquity , civilizing an extensive empire and rendering religion and government subservient to the general happiness of a great people , there is no danger that we grow too warm in his praise , or pronounce too high an eulogiurn on his character .</p>

    <p n="141">The high priest of the sun was always one of the royal family ; and in every generation after the first , was brother to the king . This office probably began with Rocha ; as he was the first who was capable of receiving it , and as it was necessary , in the education of the prince , that he should be initiated in the sacred mysteries .</p>

    <p n="144">Book III . Line 135 .</p>
    <p n="145">The lautu was a cotton band , twisted and worn on the head of the Incas as a badge of royalty . It made several turns round the head ; and , according to the description of Garcilasso , it must have resembled the Turkish turban .</p>
    <p n="146">It is possible that both the lautu and the turban had their remote origin in the ancient astronomical religion , whose principal god was the sun and usually represented under the figure of a man with the horns of the ram ; that is , the sun in the sign of aries . The form of the lautu and of the turban ( which I suppose to be the same ) seems to indicate that they were originally designed as emblems or badges ; and when properly twisted and wound round the head , as Turks of distinction usually wear the turban , they resemble the horns of the ram as represented in those figures of Jupiter Ammon where the horns curl close to the head .</p>
    <p n="147">There is an engraving in Garcilasso representing the first Inca and his wife , Capac and Oella ; and the heads of both are ornamented with rams ’ horns projecting out from the lautu . Whether the figures of these personages were usually so represented in Peru previous to the Spanish devastation , would be difficult at this day to ascertain . If it could be ascertained that they were usually so represented there , we might esteem it a remarkable circumstance in proof of the unity of the origin of their religion with that of the ancient Egyptians ; from which all the early theological systems of Asia and Europe , as far as they have come to our knowledge , were evidently derived .</p>

    <p n="154">Book III . Line 273 .</p>
    <p n="155">The historian of the Incas relates that , by the laws of the empire , none but sacred fire could be used in sacrifices ; and that there were three modes in which it might be procured . First , the most sacred fire was that which was drawn immediately from the sun himself by means of a concave mirror , which was usually made of gold or silver highly polished . Second , in case of cloudy weather or other accident , the fire might be taken from the temple , where it was preserved by the holy virgins ; whose functions and discipline resembled those of the vestals of Rome . Third , when the sacrifice was to be made in the provinces at an inconvenient distance from the temple , and when the weather was such as to prevent drawing the fire immediately from the sun , it was permitted to procure it by the friction of two pieces of dry wood .</p>
    <p n="156">The two latter modes were resorted to only in cases of necessity . Not to be able to obtain fire by means of the mirror was a bad omen , a sign of displeasure in the god ; it cast a gloom over the whole ceremony and threw the people into lamentations , fearing their offering would not be well received .</p>
    <p n="157">This method of procuring fire directly from the sun , to burn a sacrifice , must have appeared so miraculous to the savages who could not understand it , that it doubtless had a powerful effect in converting them to the solar religion and to the Incan government .</p>

    <p n="175">Las Casas . Valverde . Gasca .</p>
    <p n="176">Book IV . Line 17-27 .</p>
    <p n="177">Bartholomew de las Casas was a Dominican priest of a most amiable and heroic character . He first went to Hispaniola with Columbus in his second voyage , where he manifested an ardent but honest zeal , first in attempting to instruct the natives in the principles of the catholic faith , and afterwards in defending them against the insufferable cruelties exercised by the Spanish tyrants who succeeded Columbus in the discoveries and settlements in South America . He early declared himself Protector of the Indians ; a title which seems to have been acknowledged by the Spanish government . He devoted himself ever after to the most indefatigable labors in the service of that unhappy people . He made several voyages to Spain , to solicit , first from Ferdinand , then from cardinal Ximenes , and finalty from Charles V , some effectual restrictions against the horrid career of depopulation which every where attended the Spanish arms . He followed these monsters of cruelty into all the conquered countries ; where , by the power of his eloquence and that purity of morals which commands respect even from the worst of men , he doubtless saved the lives of many thousands of innocent people . His life was a continued struggle agaiust that deplorable system of tyranny , of which he gives a description in a treatise addressed to Philip prince of Spain , entitled Brevissima Relacion de la Destruycion de las Yndias .</p>
    <p n="178">It is said by the Spanish writers that the inhabitants of Hispaniola , when first discovered by the Spaniards , amounted to more than one million . This incredible population was reduced , in fifteen years , to sixty thousand souls .</p>
    <p n="179">Vincent Valverde was a fanatical priest who accompanied Pizarro in his destructive expedition to Peru . If we were to search the history of mankind , we should not find another such example of the united efforts of ecclesiastical hypocrisy and military ferocity , of unresisted murder and insatiable plunder , as we meet with in the account of this expedition .</p>
    <p n="180">Father Valverde , in a formal manner , gave the sanction of the church to the treacherous murder of Atabalipa and his relations ; which was immediately followed by the destruction and almost entire depopulation of a flourishing empire .</p>
    <p n="181">Pedro de la Gasca was one of the few men whose virtues form a singular contrast with the vices which disgraced the age in which he lived and the country in which he acquired his glory . He was sent over to Peru by Charles V without any military force , to quell the rebellion of the younger Pizarro and to prevent a second depopulation , by a civil war , of that country which had just been drenched in the blood of its original inhabitants . He effected this great purpose by the weight only of his personal authority and the veneration inspired by his virtues . As soon as he had suppressed the rebellion and established the government of the colony he hastened to resign his authority into the hands of his master . And tho his victories had been obtained in the richest country on earth he returned to Spain as poor as Cincinnatus ; having resisted every temptation to plunder , and refused to receive any emolument for his services .</p>

    <p n="194">The British colonies in all their early struggles for existence complained , and with reason , of the uniform indifference and discouragement which they experienced from the government of the mother country . But it was probably to that very indifference that they owed the remarkable spirit of liberty and self-dependence which created their prosperity , by inducing them uniformly to adopt republican institutions . These circumstances prepared the way for that mutual confidence and federal union which have finally formed them into a flourishing nation .</p>
    <p n="195">Ministers who feel their power over a distant colony to be uncontrolled are so naturally inclined to govern too much , that it may be a fortunate circumstance for the colony to be neglected altogether . This neglect was indeed fatal to the first Virginia settlers sent out by Sir Walter Raleigh ; and the companies who afterwards succeeded in their establishments at Jamestown in Virginia and at Plymouth in Massachusetts were very near sharing the fate of their predecessors . But after these settlements had acquired so much consistence as to assure their own continuance , it may be assumed as an historical fact , that the want of encouragement from government was rather beneficial than detrimental to the British colonies in general .</p>
    <p n="196">These establishments were in the nature of private adventures , undertaken by a few individuals at their own expense , rather than organised colonies sent abroad for a public purpose . They were companies incorporated for plantation and trade . All they asked of the mother country ( after obtaining acts of incorporation enabling them to acquire property and exercise other civil functions , such as incorporated companies at home could exercise ) was to give them charters of political franchise , ascertaining the extent and limits of their rights and duties as subjects of the British crown forming nations in parts of the earth that had been found in an uncultivated state , and far removed from the mother country .</p>
    <p n="197">As they could not in this situation be represented in the parliament of England , these charters stipulated their right of having parliaments or legislative assemblies of their own , with executive and judiciary institutions established within their territories .</p>
    <p n="198">The acknowledgment of these rights placed them on a different footing from any other modern colonies ; and the restricting clause , by which their trade was confined to the mother country , rendered their situation unlike that of the colonies of ancient Greece . Indeed the British system of colonization in America differed essentially from every other , whether ancient or modern ; if that may properly be called a system , which was rather the result of early indifference to the cries of needy adventurers , and subsequent attempts to seize upon their earnings when they became objects of rapacity . This singular train of difficulties must be considered as one of the causes of our ancient prosperity and present freedom .</p>

    <p n="202">The author of this poem will not be suspected of laying any stress on the mere circumstance of lineage or birth , as relating either to families or nations . The phrase however in the text is not without its meaning . Among the colonies derived from the several nations of Europe in modern times , those from the English have flourished far better than the others , under a parity of circumstances , such as climate , soil and productions . The reason of this undeniable fact deserves to be explained .</p>
    <p n="203">Colonies naturally carry with them the civil , political and religious institutions of their mother countries . These institutions in England are much more favorable to liberty and the development of industry than in any other part of Europe which has sent colonies abroad . But this is not all : when men for several generations have been bred up in the habit of feeling and exercising such a portion of liberty as the English nation has enjoyed , their minds are prepared to open and expand themselves as occasion may offer . They are able to embrace new circumstances , to perceive the improvements that may be drawn from them , and not only make a temperate use of that portion of self-control to which they are accustomed , but devise the means of extending it to other objects of their political relations , till they become familiar with all the interests of men in society .</p>
    <p n="204">The habitual use of the liberty of the press , of trial by jury in open court , of the accountability of public agents and of some voice in the election of legislators , must create , in a man or a nation , a character quite different from what it could be under the habitual disuse of these advantages . And when these habits are transplanted with a young colony to a distant region of the earth , enjoying a good soil and climate , with an unlimited and unoccupied country , the difference will necessarily be more remarkable .</p>
    <p n="205">A most striking illustration of this principle is exhibited in the colonies of North America . This coast , from the St. Laurence to the Missisippi , was colonized by the French and English , ( I make no account of the Dutch establishment on the Hudson nor of the Swedish on the Delaware ; they being of little importance , and early absorbed in the English settlements . ) If we look back only one hundred years from the present time , we find the French and English dominions here about equally important in point of extent and population . The French Canada , Acadia , Cape Breton , Newfoundland , Florida and Louisiana were then as far advanced in improvement as the English settlements which they flanked on each side . And the French had greatly the advantage in point of soil , interior navigation and capability of extension . They commanded and possessed the two great rivers which almost met together on the English frontier . And the space between the waters of those rivers on the west was planted with French military posts , so as to complete the investment .</p>
    <p n="206">New Orleans was begun before Philadelphia , and was much better situated to become a great commercial capital . Quebec and Montreal were older , and had the advantage of most of our other cities . Add to this that the French nation at home was about twice as populous as the English nation at home ; and as that part of the increase of colonial population which comes from emigration must naturally be derived from their respective mother countries , it might have been expected that the comparative rapidity of increase would have been in favor of the French at least two to one .</p>
    <p n="207">But the French colonists had not been habituated to the use of liberty before their emigration ; and they were not prepared nor permitted to enjoy it in any degree afterwards . Their laws were made for them in their mother country , by men who could not know their wants and who fell no interest in their prosperity ; and then they were administered by a set of agents as ignorant as their masters ; men who , from the nature of their employment and accountability , must in general be oppressive and rapacious .</p>
    <p n="208">The result has solved a great problem in political combination . One of these clusters of colonies has grown to a powerful empire , giving examples to the universe in most of the great objects which constitute the dignity of nations . The other , after having been a constant expense to the mother country , and serving for barter and exchange in the capricious vicissitudes of European despotism , presents altogether at this day a mass of population and wealth scarcely equal to one of our provinces .</p>
    <p n="209">This note is written at the moment when Louisiana , one of the most extensive but least peopled of the French colonies , is ceded to the United States . The world will see how far the above theory will now be confirmed by the rapid increase of population and improvement in that interesting portion of our continent .</p>

    <p n="219">Ultima ratio regum ; a device of Louis XIV engraved on his ordnance , and afterwards adopted by other powers . When we consider men as reasonable beings and endowed with the qualities requisite for living together in society , this device looks like a satire upon the species ; but in reality it only proves the imperfect state to which their own principles of society have yet advanced them in the long and perhaps interminable progress of which they are susceptible . This ultima ratio being already taken out of the hands of individuals and confided only to the chiefs of nations is as clear a proof of a great progress already made , as its remaining in the hands of those chiefs is a proof that we still remain far short of that degree of wisdom and experience which will enable all the nations to live at peace one with another .</p>
    <p n="220">There certainly was a time when the same device might have been written on the hatchet or club or fist of every man ; and the best weapon of destruction that he could wield against his neighbour might have been called ultima ratio virarum , meaning that human reason could go no farther . But the wisdom we have drawn from experience has taught us to restrain the use of mortal weapons , making it unlawful and showing it to be unreasonable to use them in private disputes . The principles of social intercourse and the advantages of peace are so far understood as to enable men to form great societies , and to submit their personal misunderstandings to common judges ; thus removing the ultima ratio from their own private hands to the hands of their government .</p>
    <p n="221">Hitherto there has usually been a government to every nation ; but the nations are increasing in size and diminishing in number ; so that the hands which now hold the ultima ratio by delegation are few , compared with what they have been . I mean this observation to apply only to those extensions of nationality which have been formed on the true principles of society and acquiesced in from a sense of their utility . I mean not to apply it to those unnatural and unwieldy stretches of power , whose overthrow is often and erroneously cited as an argument against the progress of civilization ; such as the conquests of Alexander , the Roman generals , Omar , Gengis Khan and others of that brilliant description . These are but meteors of compulsive force , which pass away and discourage , rather than promote , the spirit of national extension of which I speak .</p>
    <p n="222">This spirit operates constantly and kindly ; nor is its progress so slow but that it is easily perceived . Even within the short memorials of modern history we find a heptarchy in England . Ossian informs us that in his time there was a great number of warlike states in Ireland and as many more in Scotland . Without going back to the writings of Julius Cesar to discover the comparative condition of France , we may almost remember when she counted within her limits six or seven different governments , generally at war among themselves and inviting foreign enemies to come and help them destroy each other . Every province in Spain is still called a kingdom ; and it is not long since they were really so in fact , with the ultima ratio in the hands of every king .</p>
    <p n="223">The publicist who in any of those modern heroic ages could have imagined that all the hundred nations who inhabited the western borders of Europe , from the Orknies to Gibraltar , might one day become so far united in manners and interests as to form but three great nations , would certainly have passed for a madman . Had he been a minister of Phararnond or of Fingal he could no more have kept his place than Turgot could keep his after pointing out the means of promoting industry and preventing wars . He would have been told that the inhabitants of each side of the Humber were natural enemies one to the other ; that if their chiefs were even disposed to live in peace they could not do it ; their subjects would demand war and could not live without it . The same would have been said of the Seine , the Loire and every other dividing line between their petty communities . It would have been insisted on that such rivers were the natural boundaries of states and never could be otherwise .</p>
    <p n="224">But now since the people of those districts find themselves no longer on the frontiers of little warlike states , but in the centre of great industrious nations , they have lost their relish for war , and consider it as a terrible calamity ; they cherish the minister who gives them peace , and abhor the one who drives them into unnecessary wars . Their local disputes , which used to be settled by the sword , are now referred to the tribunals of the country . They have substituted a moral to a physical force . They have changed the habits of plunder for those of industry ; and they find themselves richer and happier for the change .</p>
    <p n="225">Who will say that the progress of society will stop short in the present stage of its career ? that great communities will not discover a mode of arbitrating their disputes , as little ones have done ? that nations will not lay aside their present ideas of independence and rivalship , and find themselves more happy and more secure in one great universal society , which shall contain within itself its own principles of defence , its own permanent security ? It is evident that national security , in order to be permanent , must be founded on the moral force of society at large , and not on the physical force of each nation independently exerted . The ultima ratio must not be a cannon , but a reference to some rational mode of decision worthy of rational beings .</p>

    <p n="228">Book V. Line 767 .</p>
    <p n="229">General Arnold , the leader of this detachment , had acquired by this and many other brilliant achievements a degree of military fame almost unequalled among the American generals . His shameful defection afterwards , by the foulest of treason , should be lamented as a national dishonor ; it has not only obliterated his own glory , but it seems in some sort to have cast a shade on that of others whose brave actions had been associated with his in the acquisition of their common and unadulterated fame .</p>
    <p n="230">The action here alluded to , the march thro the wilderness from Casco to Quebec , was compared in the gazettes of that day to the passage of the Alps by Hannibal . And really , considered as a scene of true military valor , patient suffering and heroic exertion ( detached from the idea of subsequent success in the ulterior expedition ) the comparison did not disgrace the Carthaginian . Yet since the defection of Arnold , which happened five years afterwards , this audacious and once celebrated exploit is scarcely mentioned in our annals . And Meigs , Dearborn , Morgan and other distinguished officers in the expedition , whom that alone might have immortalized , have been indebted to their subsequent exertions of patriotic valor for the share of celebrity their names now enjoy .</p>

    <p n="235">The systematic and inflexible course of cruelties exercised by the British armies on American prisoners during the three first years of the war were doubtless unexampled among civilized nations . Considering it as a war against rebels , neither their officers nor soldiers conceived themselves bound by the ordinary laws of war .</p>
    <p n="236">The detail of facts on this subject , especially in what concerned the prison ships , has not been sufficiently noticed in our annals ; at least not so much noticed as the interest of public morals would seem to require . Mr. Boudinot , who was the American commissary of prisoners at the time , has since informed the author of this poem that in one prison ship alone , called the Jersey , which was anchored near Newyork , eleven thousand American prisoners died in eighteen months ; almost the whole of them from the barbarous treatment of being stifled in a crowded hold with infected air , and poisoned with unwholesome food .</p>
    <p n="237">There were several other prison ships , as well as the sugar-house prison in the city , whose histories ought to be better known than they are . I say this not from any sort of enmity to the British nation , for I have none . I respect the British nation ; as will be evident from the views I have given of her genius and institutions in the course of this work . I would at all times render that nation every service consistent with my duty to my own ; and surely it is worthy of her magnanimity to consider as a real service every true information given her relative to the crimes of her agents in distant countries . These crimes are as contrary to the spirit of the nation at home as they are to the temper of her laws .</p>

    <p n="248">Book VI . Line 389 .</p>
    <p n="249">This was general sir John Johnson , an American royalist in the British service . He was the son of sir William Johnson , who had been a rich proprietor and inhabitant in the Mohawk country , in the colony of New York , and had been employed by the king as superintendant of Indian affairs . Sir William had married a Mohawk savage wife ; and it was supposed that the great influence which he had long exercised over that and the neighboring tribes must have descended to his son . It was on this account that he was employed on the expedition of Burgoyne ; in which he had the rank of brigadier general , and the special direction of the savages .</p>
    <p n="250">No . 41 .</p>
    <p n="251">Are these thy trophies , Carleton ! these the swords Thy hand unsheath 'd and gave the savage hordes ,</p>
    <p n="252">Book VI . Line 685 .</p>
    <p n="253">General sir Guy Carleton , afterwards lord Dorchester , was the British governor of Canada and superintendant of Indian affairs at the time of Burgoyne 's campaign . Having great influence with the warlike tribes who inhabited the west of Canada and the borders of the Lakes , he was ordered by the minister to adopt the barbarous and unjustifiable measure of arming and bringing them into the king 's service in aid of this expedition .</p>
    <p n="254">This was doubtless done with the consent of Burgoyne , tho he seems to have been apprehensive of the difficulty of managing a race of men whose manners were so ferocious , and whose motives to action must have been so different from those of the principal parties in the war . Burgoyne , in his narrative of this campaign , informs us that he took precautions to discourage that inhuman mode of warfare which had been customary among those savages . He ordered them to kill none but such persons as they should find in arms fighting against the king 's troops ; to spare old men , women , children and prisoners ; and not to scalp any but such as they should kill in open war . He intimated to them that he should not pay for any scalps but those thus taken from enemies killed in arms .</p>
    <p n="255">It is unfortunate for the reputation of the general and of his government , that they did not reflect on the futility of such an order and the improbability of its being executed . A certain price was offered for scalps ; the savages must know that in a bag of scalps , packed and dried and brought into camp and counted out before the commissary to receive payment , it would be impossible to distinguish the political opinions or the occupation , age or sex of the heads to which they had belonged ; it could not be ascertained whether they had been taken from Americans or British , whigs or tories , soldiers killed in arms or killed after they had resigned their arms , militia men or peasants , old or young , male or female .</p>
    <p n="256">The event proved the deplorable policy of employing such auxiliaries , especially in such multitudes as were brought together on this occasion . No sooner did hostilities begin between the two armies than these people , who could have no knowledge of the cause nor affection for either party , and whose only object was plunder and pay , began their indiscriminate and ungovernable ravages on both sides . They robbed and murdered peasants , whether royalists or others ; men , women , children , straggling and wounded soldiers of both armies . The tragical catastrophe of a young lady of the name of Macrea , whose story is almost literally detailed in the foregoing paragraphs of the text , is well known . It made a great impression on the public mind at the time , both in England and America .</p>
    <p n="257">General Carleton , in the preceding campaigns , when the war was carried into Canada , had been applauded for his humanity in the treatment of prisoners . But the part he took in this measure of associating the savages in the operations of the British army was a stain upon his character ; and the measure was highly detrimental to the royal cause , on account of the general indignation it excited thro the country .</p>

    <p n="259">That no proud privilege from birth can spring , No right divine , nor compact form a king ;</p>
    <p n="260">Book VII . Line 39 .</p>
    <p n="261">The assumed right of kings , or that supreme authority which one man exercises over a nation , and for which he is not held accountable , has been contended for on various grounds . It has been sometimes called the right of conquest ; in which is involved the absolute disposal of the lives and labors of the conquered nation , in favor of the victorious chief and his descendants to perpetuity . Sometimes it is called the divine right ; in which case kings are considered as the vicegerents of God .</p>
    <p n="262">This notion is very ancient , and it is almost universal among modern nations . Homer is full of it ; and from his unaffected recurrence to the same idea every where in his poems , it is evident that in his day it was not called in question . The manner in which the Jews were set at work to constitute their first king proves that they were convinced that , if they must have a king , he must be given them from God , and receive that solemn consecration which should establish his authority on the same divine right which was common to other nations , from whom they borrowed the principle .</p>
    <p n="263">There are some few instances in history wherein this divine right has been set aside ; but it has generally been owing rather to the violence of circumstances , which sometimes drive men to act contrary to their prejudices , tho they still retain them , than to any effort of reasoning by which they convinced themselves that this was a prejudice , and that no divine right existed in reality . For it does not violate this supposed right , to change one king for another , or one race of kings for another , tho done in a manner the most unjust and inhuman . In this case the same divine right remains , and only changes , with the diadem , from one head to another . And tho this change should happen six times in one day ( as in one instance it has done in Algiers by the murder of six successive kings ) they would still say it was God who did it all ; and the action would only tend to prove to the credulous people , that God was made after their own image , as changeable as themselves .</p>
    <p n="264">It is only in the case of Tarquin and a few others ( whose overthrow has been followed by a more popular form of government ) that it can be said that the principle of the divine right has been disregarded , laid aside and forgotten for any length of time .</p>
    <p n="265">The English are perhaps the first and only people that ever overturned this doctrine of the divinity of kings , without changing their form of government . This was brought on by circumstances , and took effect in the expulsion of James II . Books were then written to prove that the divine right of kings did not exist ; at least , not in the sense in which it had been understood . And these writings completely silenced the old doctrine in England . This indeed was gaining an immense advantage in favor of liberty ; tho the effort of reason , to arrive at it , seems to be so small .</p>
    <p n="266">But while the English were discarding the old principle they set up a new one ; which indeed is not so pernicious because it cannot become so extensive , but which is scarcely more reasonable : it is the right of kings by compact ; that is , a compact , whether written or understood , by which the representatives of a nation are supposed to bind their constituents and their descendants to be the subjects of a certain prince and of his descendants to perpetuity . This singular doctrine is developed with perspicuity , but ill supported by argument , in Burke 's Reflections on the French Revolution .</p>
    <p n="267">The principle of the American government denies the right of any representatives to make such a compact , and the right of any prince to carry it into execution if it were made . Whatever varieties or mixtures there may be in the forms of government , there are but two distinct principles on which government is founded . One supposes the source of power to be out of the people , and that the governor is not accountable to them for the manner of using it ; the other supposes the source of power to be in the people , and that the governor is accountable to them for the manner of using it . The latter is our principle . In this sense no right divine nor compact can form a king ; that is , a person , exercising underived and unreverting power .</p>

    <p n="278">Book VIII . Line 587 .</p>
    <p n="279">Benjamin West , president of the Royal Academy in London , was born and educated in Pennsylvania . At the age of twenty-three he went to Italy to perfect his taste in the art to which his genius irresistibly impelled him ; in which he was destined to cast a splendor upon the age in which he lives , and probably to excel all his cotemporaries , so far at least as we can judge from the present state of their works . After passing two years in that country of models , where canvass and marble seem to contribute their full proportion of the population , he went to London .</p>
    <p n="280">Here he soon rendered himself conspicuous for the boldness of his designs , in daring to shake off the trammels of the art so far as to paint modern history in modern dress . He had already staggered the connoisseurs in Italy while he was there , by his picture of The Savage Chief taking leave of his family on going to war . This extraordinary effort of the American pencil on an American subject excited great admiration at Venice . The picture was engraved in that city by Bartolozzi , before either he or West went to England . The artists were surprised to find that the expression of the passions of men did not depend on the robes they wore . And his early works in London , The Death of Wolfe , The Battles of the Boyne , Lahogue , &amp; c ., engraved by Woollett and others , not only established his reputation , but produced a revolution in the Art . So that modern dress has now become as familiar in fictitious as in real life ; it being justly considered essential in painting modern history .</p>
    <p n="281">The engraving from his Wolfe has been often copied in France , Italy and Germany ; and it may be said that in this picture the revolution in painting really originated . It would now be reckoned as preposterous in an artist to dress modern personages in Grecian or Roman habits , as it was before to give them the garb of the age and country to which they belonged .</p>
    <p n="282">The merit of Mr. West was early noticed and encouraged by the king ; who took him into pay with a convenient salary , and the title of historical painter to his majesty . In this situation he has decorated the king 's palaces , chapels and churches with most of those great pictures from the English history and from the Old and New Testament , which compose so considerable a portion of his works .</p>
    <p n="283">The following catalogue of his pictures was furnished me by Mr. West himself in the year 1802 . It comprises only his principal productions in historical painting , and only his finished pictures ; without mentioning his numerous portraits , or his more numerous sketches and drawings .</p>

    <p n="321">Besides the two hundred and ninety-nine large finished pictures here mentioned , Mr. West has done about one hundred portraits , and upwards of two hundred drawings with the pen ; which last , for sublimity of conception , are among the finest of his works . So that the whole of his pieces amount to above six hundred . Some of them are larger in size than any in the national gallery of France ; and he has not been assisted by any other painter .</p>
    <p n="322">Mr. West is now about sixty-eight years of age . He discovers no abatement in the activity of his genius , nor in the laborious exercise of his talents . He has painted several fine pictures since the above catalogue was made . Three of which I have particularly noticed in his painting room : Tobet and Tobias with the fish ; Abraham sending away Hagar with her child ; Achilles receiving from Thetis the new armor ; and we hear that he has lately painted the Death of Nelson . He may yet produce many more original works ; tho it is presumed he has already exceeded all other historical painters , except Rubens , in the number and variety of his productions . With regard to the merit of his pictures , I cannot pretend to form a judgment that would be of any use in directing that of others . He is doubtless the most classical painter , except Raphael , whose works are known to us .</p>
    <p n="323">The critics find fault with the coloring of Mr. West . But in his works , as in those of Raphael , we do not look for coloring . It is dignity of character , fine expression , delicate design , correct drawing and beautiful disposition of drapery which fix the suffrage of the real judge . All which qualities can only spring from an elevated mind .</p>

    <p n="330">Tis to correct their fatal faults of old , When , caught by tinsel , they forgot the gold .</p>
    <p n="331">Book IX . Line 499 .</p>
    <p n="332">The state of the arts and sciences among the ancients , viewed with reference to the event of universal civilization , was faulty in two respects . First , In their comparative estimation : Second , In their flourishing only in one nation at a time . These circumstances might be favorable to the exertions of individual genius ; and they may be assigned both as causes of the universal destruction of the arts and sciences by the Gothic conquest , and as reasons why we should not greatly lament that destruction .</p>
    <p n="333">From the political state of mankind in the days of their ancient splendor it was natural that those arts which depend on the imagination , such as Architecture , Statuary , Painting , Eloquence and Poetry , should claim the highest rank in the estimation of a people . In several , perhaps all of these , the ancients remain unrivalled . But these are not the arts which tend the most to the general improvement of society . A man in those days would have rendered more service to the world by ascertaining the true figure and movements of the earth , than by originating a heaven and filling it with all the gods of Homer ; and had the expenses of the Egyptian pyramids been employed in furnishing ships of discovery and sending them out of the Mediterranean , the nations called civilized would not have been afterwards overrun by Barbarians .</p>
    <p n="334">But the sciences of Geography , Navigation and Commerce , with their consequent improvements in Natural Philosophy and Humanity , could not , from the nature of things at that time , become objects of great encouragement or enterprise . Talent was therefore confined to the cultivation of arts more striking to the senses . As these arts were adapted to gratify the vanity of princes , to help carry on the sacred frauds of priests , to fire the ambition of heroes , or to gain causes in popular assemblies , they were brought to a degree of perfection which prevented their being relished or understood by barbarous neighbors .</p>
    <p n="335">The improvements of the world therefore , whether in literature , sciences or arts , descended with the line of conquest from one nation to another , till the whole were concentred in the Roman empire . Their tendency there was to inspire a contempt for nations less civilized , and to teach the Romans to consider all mankind as the proper objects of their military despotism . These circumstances prepared , thro a course of ages , and finally opened a scene of wretchedness at which the human mind has been taught to shudder . But some such convulsion seemed necessary to reduce the nations to a position capable of commencing regular improvements . And , however novel the sentiment may appear , I will venture to say that , as to the prospect of universal civilization , mankind were in a better situation in the time of Charlemagne than they were in the days of Augustus .</p>
    <p n="336">The final destruction of the Roman empire left the nations of Europe in circumstances similar to each other ; and their consequent rivalship prevented any disproportionate refinement from appearing in any particular region . The principles of government , firmly rooted in the Feudal System , unsocial and unphilosophical as they were , laid the foundation of that balance of power which discourages the Cesars and Alexanders of modern ages from attempting the conquest of the world .</p>
    <p n="337">It seems necessary that the arrangement of events in civilizing the world should be in the following order : first , all parts of it must be considerably peopled ; second , the different nations must be known to each other ; third , their wants must be increased , in order to inspire a passion for commerce . The first of these objects was not probably accomplished till a late period . The second for three centuries past has been greatly accelerated . The third is a necessary consequence of the two former . The spirit of commerce is happily calculated to open an amicable intercourse between all countries , to soften the horrors of war , to enlarge the field of science , and to assimilate the manners , feelings and languages of all nations . This leading principle , in its remoter consequences , will produce advantages in favor of free government , give patriotism the character of philanthropy , induce all men to regard each other as brethren and friends , and teach them the benefits of peace and harmony among the nations .</p>
    <p n="338">I conceive it no objection to this theory that the progress has hitherto been slow ; when we consider the magnitude of the object , the obstructions that were to be removed , and the length of time taken to accomplish it . The future progress will probably be more rapid than the past . Since the invention of printing , the application of the properties of the magnet , and the knowledge of the structure of the solar system , it is difficult to conceive of a cause that can produce a new state of barbarism ; unless it be some great convulsion in the physical world , so extensive as to change the face of the earth or a considerable part of it . This indeed may have been the case already more than once , since the earth was first peopled with men , and antecedent to our histories . But such events have nothing to do with the present argument .</p>

    <p n="340">Herschel ascends himself with venturous wain , And joins and flanks thy planetary train ,</p>
    <p n="341">Book IX . Line 601 .</p>
    <p n="342">The planet discovered by Herschel was called by him Georgium Sidus ; but in all countries except England it is named Herschel , and probably will be so named there after his death and that of the patron to whom his gratitude led him to make this extraordinary dedication .</p>
    <p n="343">I would observe that , besides the impropriety of giving it another name than that of the discoverer , it is inconvenient to use a double name , or a name composed of two words . Let it be either George or Herschel .</p>
    <p n="344">The passage referred to in this note was written before the discovery of the three other planets which are now added to our catalogue . Could my voice have weight in deciding on the names to be given to these new children of the sun , I would call them by the names of their respective discoverers , Piazzi , Gibers and Harding , instead of the senseless and absurd appellations of Ceres , Pallas and Juno . The former method would at least assist us in preserving the history of science ; the latter will only tend farther to confuse a very ancient mythology which is already extremely confused , and increase the difficulty of following the faint traces of real knowledge that seems couched under the mass of that mythology ; traces which may one day lead to many useful truths in philosophy and morals .</p>
    <p n="345">No . 49 .</p>
    <p n="346">To build on ruin 'd realms the shrine of fame , And load his numbers with a tyrant 's name .</p>
    <p n="347">Book X . Line 261 .</p>
    <p n="348">A most useful book might be written on this subject . It should be a Review of Poets and Historians , as to the moral and political tendency of their works . It should likewise treat of the importance of the task assigned to these two classes of writers . It might attempt to point out the true object they ought to have in view ; perhaps do this with such clearness and energy as to gain the attention of writers as well as readers , and thus serve in some measure as a guide to future historians and poets . At least it would prove a guide to readers ; and by teaching them how to judge , and what to praise or blame in the accounts of human actions , whether real or fictitious , the public taste would be reformed by degrees . In this case the recorders of heroic actions , as well as the authors of them , would find it necessary to follow this reform , or they must necessarily fail of obtaining the celebrity to which they all aspire .</p>
    <p n="349">I think every person who will give himself the trouble to form an opinion on the manner in which actions , called heroic , have been recorded , must find it faulty ; and must lament , as one of the misfortunes of society , that writers of these two classes almost universally , from Homer down to Gibbon , have led astray the moral sense of man . In this view we may say in general of poets and historians , as we do of their heroes , that they have injured the cause of humanity almost in proportion to the fame they have acquired .</p>
    <p n="350">I would not be understood by this observation to mean that such writers have done no good . Even the works of Homer , which have caused more mischief to mankind than those of any other , have likewise been a fruitful source of a certain species of benefits . They elevate the mind of every reader ; they have called forth great exertions of genius in poets , artists , philosophers and heroes , thro a long succession of ages . But it remains to be considered what a fruitful source they have likewise been of those false notions of honor and erroneous systems of policy which have governed the actions of men from his day to ours .</p>
    <p n="351">If , instead of the Iliad , he had given us a work of equal splendor founded on an opposite principle ; whose object should have been to celebrate the useful arts of agriculture and navigation ; to build the immortal fame of his heroes , and occupy his whole hierarchy of gods , on actions that contribute to the real advancement of society , instead of striking away every foundation on which society ought to be established or can be greatly advanced ; mankind , enriched with such a work at that early period , would have given a useful turn to their ambition thro all succeeding ages .</p>
    <p n="352">It is not easy to conceive how different the state of nations would have been at this day from what we now find it , had such a bent been given to the pursuits of genius , and such glory cast upon actions truly worthy of imitation . I have treated this subject more at large in the third chapter of Advise to the Privileged Orders .</p>
    <p n="353">But it will be asked how this kind of censure can attach to the writers of history , whose business is to invent nothing , to confine themselves to the simple narration of facts , and relate the actions of men , not as they should be , but as they are . This is indeed a part of the duty of the historian ; but it is not his whole duty . His narrative should be clear and simple ; but he should likewise develop the political and moral tendency of the transactions he details .</p>
    <p n="354">In reviewing actions or doctrines which favor despotism , injustice , false morals or political errors , he should not suffer them to pass without an open and well supported censure . He should show how the authors of such actions might have conducted themselves and succeeded in gaining the celebrity which they sought , by doing good instead of harm to the age and country where they acquired their fame .</p>
    <p n="355">The history of human actions , in a political view , has generally been the history of human errors . The writers who have given it to us do not appear to have been sensible of this . How then are young readers to be sensible of it ? Their minds are still to be formed ; and those who are destined for public life must in a great measure take their bias from the study of history . But history in general , to answer the purpose of sound instruction to the future guides of nations , must be rewritten . For example : among the hundred historians who have treated of what is called the Roman Republic I know not one who has told us this important fact , that Rome never had a republic . The same may be said of Athens , and of several other turbulent associations of men in former ages . And it is for want of this attention or this knowledge in the writers of their histories , that the republican principle of government is so generally associated , even at this day , with the idea of insurrection , anarchy and the desire of conquest . Whereas it is in fact the want of the republican principle , not the practice of it , which has occasioned all the insurrections , anarchy and desire of conquest , that have disturbed the order of society both in ancient and modern times .</p>
    <p n="356">Again : in relating the destruction of Carthage , a measure which the zealous patriots , both before and after , considered so essential to the glory of the Roman state , and which has immortalized so many heroes as the authors and projectors of that destruction , I believe no historian has told us that the disease , decay and downfall of Rome itself were occasioned by that measure , and must be dated from that epoch ; and that the actions of Regulus and Scipio , the themes of universal applause , were really more injurious to their country than those of Marias and Sylla , the objects ( and justly so ) of universal detestation .</p>
    <p n="357">If these principles had been understood by Polybius and his successors in the brilliant heritage of history , and had been properly impressed on the minds of their readers , we should not have heard old Cato 's vociferation delenda est Carthago applied to the American states by an orator of the British parliament , as we did during the war ; because every member of that parliament must have understood that the prosperity of these states would be highly advantageous to Britain , from the extensive commercial intercourse that the relative situation of the two countries required . Neither should we see at this day the French English nations seeking to impoverish and extirpate each other ; each of them entertaining the erroneous and absurd opinion that its own prosperity is to be increased by the adversity of its neighbor . We should have learned long ago from the plain dictates of reason , instead of having it beat into us some ages hence by costly experience , that the true dignity of a state is in the happiness of its members ; and that their happiness is best promoted by the pursuit of industry at home and the free exchange of their productions abroad .</p>
    <p n="358">We should have perceived the real and constant interest that every nation has in the prosperity of its neighbors , instead of their destruction . France would have perceived that the wealth of the English would be beneficial to her , by enabling them to receive and pay for more of her produce . England would have seen the same thing with regard to the French ; and such would have been the sentiments of other nations reciprocally and universally .</p>
    <p n="359">I know I must be called an extravagant theorist if I insinuate that all these good things would have resulted from having history well written and poetry well conceived . No man will doubt however that such would have been the tendency ; nor can we deny that the contrary has resulted , at least in some degree , from the manner in which such writings have been composed . And why should we write at all , if not to benefit mankind ? The public mind , as well as the individual mind , receives its propensities ; it is equally the creature of habit . Nations are educated , like a single child . They only require a longer time and a greater number of teachers .</p>
    <p n="360">No . 50 .</p>
    <p n="361">For that fine apologue , in mystic strain , Gave like the rest a golden age to man ,</p>
    <p n="362">Book X . Line 393 .</p>
    <p n="363">Absurdities in speculative opinion are commonly considered as innocent things ; and we are told every day that they are not worth refuting . So far as opinions are sure to rest merely in speculation , and cannot in any degree become practical , this is doubtless the proper way of treating them . But there are few opinions of this dormant and indifferent kind , especially among those that become general and classical among the nations .</p>
    <p n="364">The activity of such , tho imperceptible , is extensive . They get wrought into our intellectual existence , and govern our modes of acting as well as thinking . The interest of society therefore requires that they should be scrutinized , and that such as are erroneous should be exposed , in order to be rejected ; when their place may be supplied by truth and reason , which nourish the mind and accelerate the progress of improvement .</p>
    <p n="365">Among the absurd notions which early turned the heads of the teachers of mankind , and which are so ridiculous as generally to escape our censure , is that of a Golden Age ; or the idea that men were more perfect , more moral and more happy in some early stage of their intercourse , before they cultivated the earth and formed great societies .</p>
    <p n="366">The author of Don Quixote has played his artillery upon this doctrine to very good effect ; he has summoned against it all the force of our contempt by making it the text of one of the gravest discourses of his hero . But my sensibility is such on moral and political errors , as rarely to be satisfied with the weapon of ridicule ; tho I know it to be one of the most mortal of intellectual weapons .</p>
    <p n="367">The notion that the social state of men cannot ameliorate , that they have formerly been better than they now are , and that they are continually growing worse , is pregnant with infinite mischief . I know no doctrine in the whole labyrinth of imposture that has a more immoral tendency . It discourages the efforts of all political virtue ; it is a constant and practical apology for oppression , tyranny , despotism , in every shape , in every corner of society , as well as from the throne , the pulpit , the tribunal and the camp . It inculcates the belief that ignorance is better than knowledge ; that war and violence are more natural than industry and peace ; that deserts and tombs are more glorious than joyful cities and cultivated fields .</p>
    <p n="368">One of the most operative means of bringing forward our improvements and of making mankind wiser and better than they are , is to convince them that they are capable of becoming so . Without this conviction they may indeed improve slowly , unsteadily and almost imperceptibly , as they have done within the period in which our histories are able to trace them . But this conviction , impressed on the minds of the chiefs and teachers of nations , and inculcated in their schools , would greatly expedite our advancement in public happiness and virtue . Perhaps it would in a great measure insure the world against any future shocks and retrograde steps , such as heretofore it has often , experienced .</p>
    <p n="369">Postscript .</p>
    <p n="370">I am well aware that some readers will be dissatisfied in certain instances with my orthography . Their judgments are respectable ; and as it is not a wanton deviation from ancient usage on my part , the subject may justify a moment 's retrospect from this place . Since we have arrived at the end of a work that has given me more pleasure in the composition than it probably will in its reception by the public , they must pardon me if I thus linger awhile in taking leave . It is a favorite object of amusement as well as labor , which I cannot hope to replace .</p>
    <p n="371">Our language is constantly and rapidly improving . The unexampled progress of the sciences and arts for the last thirty years has enriched it with a great number of new words , which are now become as necessary to the writer as his ancient mother tongue . The same progress which leads to farther extensions of ideas will still extend the vocabulary ; and our neology must and will keep pace with the advancement of our knowledge . Hence will follow a closer definition and more accurate use of words , with a stricter attention to their orthography .</p>
    <p n="372">Such innovations ought undoubtedly to be admitted with caution ; and they will of course be severely scrutinized by men of letters . A language is public property , in the most extensive sense of the word ; and readers as well as writers arc its guardians . But they ought to have no objection to improving the estate as it passes thro their hands , by making a liberal tho rigid estimate of what may be offered as ameliorations . Some respectable philologists have proposed a total and immediate reform of our orthography and even of our alphabet ; but the great body of proprietors in this heritage are of opinion that the attempt would be less advantageous than the slow and certain improvements which are going forward , and which will necessarily continue to attend the active state of our literature .</p>
    <p n="373">We have long since laid aside the Latin diphthongs æ and oe in common English words , and in some proper names tho not in all . Uniformity in this respect is desirable and will prevail . Names of that description which occur in this work I have therefore written with the simple vowel , as Cesar , Phenicia , Etna , Medea .</p>
    <p n="374">Another class of our words are in a gradual state of reform . They are those Latin nouns ending in or , which having past thro France on their way from Rome , changed their o into eu . The Norman English writers restored the Latin o , but retained the French u ; and tho the latter has been since rejected in most of these words , yet in others it is still retained by many writers . It is quite useless in pronunciation ; and propriety as well as analogy requires that the reform should be carried thro . No writer at this day retains the u in actor , author , emperor and the far greater part , perhaps nine tenths , of this class of nouns ; why then should it be continued in the few that remain , such as labor , honor ? The most accurate authors reject it in all these , and I have followed the example .</p>
    <p n="375">I have also respectable authorities in prose as well as poetry for expunging the three last letters in though and through ; they being totally disregarded in pronunciation and awkward in appearance . The long sound of o in many words , as go , fro , puts it out of doubt with respect to tho ; and its sound of oo , which , frequently occurs , as in prove , move , is an equal justification of thro . All the British poets , from Pope downwards , and several eminent prose writers , including Shaftsbury and Staunton , have by their practice supported this orthography .</p>
    <p n="376">Some verbs in the past tense , where the usual ending in ed is harsh and uncouth , hare long ago changed it for t , as fixt , capt , meant , past , blest . Poetry has extended this innovation to many other verbs which are necessarily uttered with the sound of t , tho in prose they may still retain for a while their ancient ed . I consider this reform as a valuable improvement in the language , because it brings a numerous class of words to be written as they are spoken ; and the proportion of the reformed ones is already so considerable that analogy , or regularity of conjugation , requires us to complete the list . I have not carried this reform much farther than other poets have done before me . Examples might perhaps be found for nearly all the instances in which I have indulged it , such as perisht , astonisht , tho I have not been solicitous to seek them . The correction might well be extended to several remaining verbs of the same class ; but it is difficult in this particular case to fix the proper limit .</p>
    <p n="377">With regard to the apostrophe , as employed to mark the elision in the past tense of verbs , I have followed the example of the most accurate poets ; who use it where the verb in the present tense does not end in e , as furl 'd , because the ed would add a syllable and destroy the measure . But where the present tense ends in e , it is retained in the past with the d , as robed , because it does not add a syllable .</p>
    <p n="378">The letter k we borrowed from the Greek , and the c from the Latin . The power of each of these letters at the end of a word is precisely the same ; and the power of one is the same as that of both . Yet our early writers placed them both at the end of certain words , with the c before the k , as musick , publick , why they did not put the k first , as being the most ancient character , does not appear . Modern authors have rejected the k sit the end of this class of words ; and no correct writer will think of replacing such an inconvenient appendage .</p>
    <p n="379">The idea of putting a stop to innovation in a living language is absurd , unless we put a stop to thinking . When a language becomes fixt it becomes a dead language . Men must leave it for a living one , in which they can express their ideas with all their changes , extensions and corrections . The duty of the critic in this case is only to keep a steady watch over the innovations that are offered , and require a rigid conformity to the general principles of the idiom . Noah Webster , to whose philological labors our language will be much indebted for its purity and regularity , has pointed out the advantages of a steady course of improvement , and how it ought to be conducted . The Preface to his new Dictionary is an able performance . He might advantageously give it more development , with some correction , and publish it as a Prospectus to the great work he now has in hand .</p>
    <p n="380">The uniform tendency of our language is towards simplicity as well as regularity . With this view the final e , in words where it is quite silent and useless , is dropping off , and will soon disappear . Having long since resigned the place it held in the greater part of these words , as joye , ruine , and more recently in some others , it must finally quit the remainder where it is still found a superfluous letter , as active , decisive , determine .</p>
    <p n="381">We may even hazard a prediction that our whole class of adjectives ending in ous will be reformed and brought nearer to their pronunciation by rejecting the o . A similar change may be expected in words ending in ss . These words have already undergone one reform ; they were formerly written with a final e , as wildernesse . They have lost the e because it was useless ; and as the final s has now become equally useless , it might be dismissed with as little violence to the language . But these two projected innovations have not yet been ventured upon in any degree ; and it is not desirable to be the first in so daring an enterprise , when it is not immediately important .</p>
