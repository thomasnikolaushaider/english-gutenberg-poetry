     <l n="5">This feeling creature form 'd to love ,</l>
     <l n="6">To watch , and to defend ,</l>
     <l n="7">Was given to man by powers above ,</l>
     <l n="8">A guardian , and a friend !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">I sing , of all e'er known to live</l>

     <l n="12">Brave Fido ! it is thine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">A dog of many a sportive trick ,</l>
     <l n="14">Tho ’ rough and large of limb .</l>
     <l n="15">Fido would chase the floating stick</l>
     <l n="16">When Lucy cried , “ go swim . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">And what command could Lucy give ,</l>

     <l n="19">For her it seemed his pride to live ,</l>
     <l n="20">Blest in her gentle sway !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">For conscious of her every care</l>
     <l n="22">He strain 'd each feeling nerve ,</l>
     <l n="23">To please that friend , his lady fair</l>
     <l n="24">Commanded him to serve .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">Of many friends to Lucy dear ,</l>
     <l n="26">One rose above the rest ;</l>
     <l n="27">Proclaim 'd , in glory 's bright career .</l>

     <l n="33">The farewell rack 'd poor Lucy 's heart ,</l>

     <l n="52">A lesson to the earth !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="53">Not in the battle 's gory tide ,</l>
     <l n="54">Nor in the stormy seas ,</l>
     <l n="55">No ! Fido 's noble faith was tried</l>
     <l n="56">In scenes of sportive ease .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="57">Often in India 's sultry soil</l>
     <l n="58">To brace the languid limb ,</l>
     <l n="59">‘ Twas Edward 's pleasure , after toil ,</l>
     <l n="60">To take a fearless swim .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="61">Bold in a flood he lov 'd to leap .</l>
     <l n="62">When full the current flow 'd ;</l>
     <l n="63">Nor dreamt the water , dark , and deep .</l>
     <l n="64">The crocodile 's abode .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="65">And fearless he and Fido oft ,</l>
     <l n="66">Along the stream would glide ;</l>
     <l n="67">Their custom from the bank aloft</l>
     <l n="68">To vault into the tide !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="69">But once , when Edward had begun</l>
     <l n="70">To cast his clothes aside ,</l>
     <l n="71">Round him his dog would anxious run ,</l>
     <l n="72">And much to check him tried .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="73">So much , that had dumb Fido said</l>
     <l n="74">“ Avoid the stream to day ! ”</l>
     <l n="75">Those words could scarce have plainer made</l>
     <l n="76">What duty wish 'd to say .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="77">Edward , too eager to enjoy</l>
     <l n="78">The sport , where danger lay ,</l>
     <l n="79">Scolds him for gestures , that annoy ,</l>
     <l n="80">And beats his guard away :</l>

     <l n="89">Heaven ! how the heart of Edward swell 'd</l>
     <l n="90">Upon the river 's brink ,</l>
