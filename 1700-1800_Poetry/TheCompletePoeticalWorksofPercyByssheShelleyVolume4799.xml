     <l n="2">Sing , Muse , the son of Maia and of Jove ,</l>
     <l n="3">The Herald-child , king of Arcadia</l>
     <l n="4">And all its pastoral hills , whom in sweet love</l>
     <l n="5">Having been interwoven , modest May</l>
     <l n="6">Bore Heaven 's dread Supreme . An antique grove 5</l>
     <l n="7">Shadowed the cavern where the lovers lay</l>
     <l n="8">In the deep night , unseen by Gods or Men ,</l>
     <l n="9">And white-armed Juno slumbered sweetly then .</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="10">2 .</l>
     <l n="11">Now , when the joy of Jove had its fulfilling ,</l>
     <l n="12">And Heaven 's tenth moon chronicled her relief , 10</l>
     <l n="13">She gave to light a babe all babes excelling ,</l>
     <l n="14">A schemer subtle beyond all belief ;</l>
     <l n="15">A shepherd of thin dreams , a cow-stealing ,</l>
     <l n="16">A night-watching , and door-waylaying thief ,</l>
     <l n="17">Who ‘ mongst the Gods was soon about to thieve , 15</l>
     <l n="18">And other glorious actions to achieve .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="19">3 .</l>
     <l n="20">The babe was born at the first peep of day ;</l>
     <l n="21">He began playing on the lyre at noon ,</l>
     <l n="22">And the same evening did he steal away</l>
     <l n="23">Apollo 's herds ;— the fourth day of the moon 20</l>
     <l n="24">On which him bore the venerable May ,</l>
     <l n="25">From her immortal limbs he leaped full soon ,</l>
     <l n="26">Nor long could in the sacred cradle keep ,</l>
     <l n="27">But out to seek Apollo 's herds would creep .</l>

     <l n="28">4 .</l>
     <l n="29">Out of the lofty cavern wandering 25</l>
     <l n="30">He found a tortoise , and cried out — ‘ A treasure ! ’</l>
     <l n="31">( For Mercury first made the tortoise sing )</l>
     <l n="32">The beast before the portal at his leisure</l>
     <l n="33">The flowery herbage was depasturing ,</l>
     <l n="34">Moving his feet in a deliberate measure 30</l>
     <l n="35">Over the turf . Jove 's profitable son</l>
     <l n="36">Eying him laughed , and laughing thus begun :—</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="37">5 .</l>
     <l n="38">‘ A useful godsend are you to me now ,</l>
     <l n="39">King of the dance , companion of the feast ,</l>
     <l n="40">Lovely in all your nature ! Welcome , you 35</l>
     <l n="41">Excellent plaything ! Where , sweet mountain-beast ,</l>
     <l n="42">Got you that speckled shell ? Thus much I know ,</l>
     <l n="43">You must come home with me and be my guest ;</l>
     <l n="44">You will give joy to me , and I will do</l>
     <l n="45">All that is in my power to honour you . 40</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="46">6 .</l>
     <l n="47">‘ Better to be at home than out of door ,</l>
     <l n="48">So come with me ; and though it has been said</l>
     <l n="49">That you alive defend from magic power ,</l>
     <l n="50">I know you will sing sweetly when you 're dead . ’</l>
     <l n="51">Thus having spoken , the quaint infant bore , 45</l>
     <l n="52">Lifting it from the grass on which it fed</l>
     <l n="53">And grasping it in his delighted hold ,</l>
     <l n="54">His treasured prize into the cavern old .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="55">7 .</l>
     <l n="56">Then scooping with a chisel of gray steel ,</l>
     <l n="57">He bored the life and soul out of the beast .— 50</l>
     <l n="58">Not swifter a swift thought of woe or weal</l>
     <l n="59">Darts through the tumult of a human breast</l>
     <l n="60">Which thronging cares annoy — not swifter wheel</l>
     <l n="61">The flashes of its torture and unrest</l>
     <l n="62">Out of the dizzy eyes — than Maia 's son 55</l>
     <l n="63">All that he did devise hath featly done .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="64">8 .</l>
     <l n="65">...</l>
     <l n="66">And through the tortoise 's hard stony skin</l>
     <l n="67">At proper distances small holes he made ,</l>
     <l n="68">And fastened the cut stems of reeds within ,</l>
     <l n="69">And with a piece of leather overlaid 60</l>
     <l n="70">The open space and fixed the cubits in ,</l>
     <l n="71">Fitting the bridge to both , and stretched o'er all</l>
     <l n="72">Symphonious cords of sheep-gut rhythmical .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="73">9 .</l>
     <l n="74">When he had wrought the lovely instrument ,</l>
     <l n="75">He tried the chords , and made division meet , 65</l>
     <l n="76">Preluding with the plectrum , and there went</l>
     <l n="77">Up from beneath his hand a tumult sweet</l>
     <l n="78">Of mighty sounds , and from his lips he sent</l>
     <l n="79">A strain of unpremeditated wit</l>
     <l n="80">Joyous and wild and wanton — such you may 70</l>
     <l n="81">Hear among revellers on a holiday .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="82">10 .</l>
     <l n="83">He sung how Jove and May of the bright sandal</l>
     <l n="84">Dallied in love not quite legitimate ;</l>
     <l n="85">And his own birth , still scoffing at the scandal ,</l>
     <l n="86">And naming his own name , did celebrate ; 75</l>
     <l n="87">His mother 's cave and servant maids he planned all</l>
     <l n="88">In plastic verse , her household stuff and state ,</l>
     <l n="89">Perennial pot , trippet , and brazen pan ,—</l>
     <l n="90">But singing , he conceived another plan .</l>

     <l n="91">11 .</l>
     <l n="92">...</l>
     <l n="93">Seized with a sudden fancy for fresh meat , 80</l>
     <l n="94">He in his sacred crib deposited</l>
     <l n="95">The hollow lyre , and from the cavern sweet</l>
     <l n="96">Rushed with great leaps up to the mountain 's head ,</l>
     <l n="97">Revolving in his mind some subtle feat</l>
     <l n="98">Of thievish craft , such as a swindler might 85</l>
     <l n="99">Devise in the lone season of dun night .</l>

     <l n="102">Driven steeds and chariot — the child meanwhile strode</l>
     <l n="103">O'er the Pierian mountains clothed in shadows ,</l>
     <l n="104">Where the immortal oxen of the God 90</l>
     <l n="105">Are pastured in the flowering unmown meadows ,</l>
     <l n="106">And safely stalled in a remote abode .—</l>
     <l n="107">The archer Argicide , elate and proud ,</l>

     <l n="111">But , being ever mindful of his craft ,</l>
     <l n="112">Backward and forward drove he them astray ,</l>
     <l n="113">So that the tracks which seemed before , were aft ;</l>
     <l n="114">His sandals then he threw to the ocean spray ,</l>
     <l n="115">And for each foot he wrought a kind of raft 100</l>
     <l n="116">Of tamarisk , and tamarisk-like sprigs ,</l>
     <l n="117">And bound them in a lump with withy twigs .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="118">14 .</l>

     <l n="121">His track ; and then , a self-sufficing wight , 105</l>
     <l n="122">Like a man hastening on some distant way ,</l>
     <l n="123">He from Pieria 's mountain bent his flight ;</l>
     <l n="124">But an old man perceived the infant pass</l>
     <l n="125">Down green Onchestus heaped like beds with grass .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="126">15 .</l>

     <l n="142">Sea-strewn , the Pallantean Moon sublime</l>
     <l n="143">Into her watch-tower just began to climb . 125</l>

   <p>THE CYCLOPS .</p>
   <p>A SATYRIC DRAMA TRANSLATED FROM THE GREEK OF EURIPIDES .</p>
   <note>Published by Mrs. Shelley , “ Posthumous Poems ” , 1824 ; dated 1819 . Amongst the Shelley manuscripts at the Bodleian there is a copy , ‘ practically complete , ’ which has been collated by Mr. C. D . Locock . See “ Examination ” , etc ., 1903 , pages 64-70 . ‘ Though legible throughout , and comparatively free from corrections , it has the appearance of being a first draft ’ ( Locock ) .</note>
   <p>SILENUS . ULYSSES . CHORUS OF SATYRS . THE CYCLOPS .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : O Bacchus , what a world of toil , both now And ere these limbs were overworn with age , Have I endured for thee ! First , when thou fled'st The mountain-nymphs who nursed thee , driven afar By the strange madness Juno sent upon thee ; 5 Then in the battle of the Sons of Earth , When I stood foot by foot close to thy side , No unpropitious fellow-combatant , And , driving through his shield my winged spear , Slew vast Enceladus . Consider now , 10 Is it a dream of which I speak to thee ? By Jove it is not , for you have the trophies ! And now I suffer more than all before . For when I heard that Juno had devised A tedious voyage for you , I put to sea 15 With all my children quaint in search of you , And I myself stood on the beaked prow And fixed the naked mast ; and all my boys Leaning upon their oars , with splash and strain Made white with foam the green and purple sea ,— 20 And so we sought you , king . We were sailing Near Malea , when an eastern wind arose , And drove us to this waste Aetnean rock ; The one-eyed children of the Ocean God , The man-destroying Cyclopses , inhabit , 25 On this wild shore , their solitary caves , And one of these , named Polypheme . has caught us To be his slaves ; and so , for all delight Of Bacchic sports , sweet dance and melody , We keep this lawless giant 's wandering flocks . 30 My sons indeed on far declivities , Young things themselves , tend on the youngling sheep , But I remain to fill the water-casks , Or sweeping the hard floor , or ministering Some impious and abominable meal 35 To the fell Cyclops . I am wearied of it ! And now I must scrape up the littered floor With this great iron rake , so to receive My absent master and his evening sheep In a cave neat and clean . Even now I see 40 My children tending the flocks hitherward . Ha ! what is this ? are your Sicinnian measures Even now the same , as when with dance and song You brought young Bacchus to Althaea 's halls ?</p>
   <p>NOTE : 23 waste B .; wild 1824 ; ‘ cf . 26 , where waste is cancelled for wild ’ ( Locock ) .</p>
   <p>CHORUS OF SATYRS :</p>
   <p>STROPHE : Where has he of race divine 45 Wandered in the winding rocks ? Here the air is calm and fine For the father of the flocks ;— Here the grass is soft and sweet , And the river-eddies meet 50 In the trough beside the cave , Bright as in their fountain wave .— Neither here , nor on the dew Of the lawny uplands feeding ? Oh , you come !— a stone at you 55 Will I throw to mend your breeding ;— Get along , you horned thing , Wild , seditious , rambling !</p>
   <p>EPODE : An Iacchic melody To the golden Aphrodite 60 Will I lift , as erst did I Seeking her and her delight With the Maenads , whose white feet To the music glance and fleet . Bacchus , O beloved , where , 65 Shaking wide thy yellow hair , Wanderest thou alone , afar ? To the one-eyed Cyclops , we , Who by right thy servants are , Minister in misery , 70 In these wretched goat-skins clad , Far from thy delights and thee .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Be silent , sons ; command the slaves to drive The gathered flocks into the rock-roofed cave .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Go ! But what needs this serious haste , O father ? 75</p>
   <p>SILENUS : I see a Grecian vessel on the coast , And thence the rowers with some general Approaching to this cave .— About their necks Hang empty vessels , as they wanted food , And water-flasks .— Oh , miserable strangers ! 80 Whence come they , that they know not what and who My master is , approaching in ill hour The inhospitable roof of Polypheme , And the Cyclopian jaw-bone , man-destroying ? Be silent , Satyrs , while I ask and hear 85 Whence coming , they arrive the Aetnean hill .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Friends , can you show me some clear water-spring , The remedy of our thirst ? Will any one Furnish with food seamen in want of it ? Ha ! what is this ? We seem to be arrived 90 At the blithe court of Bacchus . I observe This sportive band of Satyrs near the caves . First let me greet the elder .— Hail !</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Hail thou , O Stranger ! tell thy country and thy race .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : The Ithacan Ulysses and the king 95 Of Cephalonia .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Oh ! I know the man , Wordy and shrewd , the son of Sisyphus .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : I am the same , but do not rail upon me .—</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Whence sailing do you come to Sicily ?</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : From Ilion , and from the Trojan toils . 100</p>
   <p>SILENUS : How , touched you not at your paternal shore ?</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : The strength of tempests bore me here by force .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : The self-same accident occurred to me .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Were you then driven here by stress of weather ?</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Following the Pirates who had kidnapped Bacchus . 105</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : What land is this , and who inhabit it ?—</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Aetna , the loftiest peak in Sicily .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : And are there walls , and tower-surrounded towns ?</p>
   <p>SILENUS : There are not .— These lone rocks are bare of men .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : And who possess the land ? the race of beasts ? 110</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Cyclops , who live in caverns , not in houses .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Obeying whom ? Or is the state popular ?</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Shepherds : no one obeys any in aught .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : How live they ? do they sow the corn of Ceres ?</p>
   <p>SILENUS : On milk and cheese , and on the flesh of sheep . 115</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Have they the Bromian drink from the vine 's stream ?</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Ah ! no ; they live in an ungracious land .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : And are they just to strangers ?— hospitable ?</p>
   <p>SILENUS : They think the sweetest thing a stranger brings Is his own flesh .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : What ! do they eat man 's flesh ? 120</p>
   <p>SILENUS : No one comes here who is not eaten up .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : The Cyclops now — where is he ? Not at home ?</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Absent on Aetna , hunting with his dogs .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Know'st thou what thou must do to aid us hence ?</p>
   <p>SILENUS : I know not : we will help you all we can . 125</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Provide us food , of which we are in want .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Here is not anything , as I said , but meat .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : But meat is a sweet remedy for hunger .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Cow 's milk there is , and store of curdled cheese .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Bring out :— I would see all before I bargain . 130</p>
   <p>SILENUS : But how much gold will you engage to give ?</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : I bring no gold , but Bacchic juice .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Oh , joy ! Tis long since these dry lips were wet with wine .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Maron , the son of the God , gave it me .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Whom I have nursed a baby in my arms . 135</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : The son of Bacchus , for your clearer knowledge .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Have you it now ?— or is it in the ship ?</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Old man , this skin contains it , which you see .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Why , this would hardly be a mouthful for me .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Nay , twice as much as you can draw from thence . 140</p>
   <p>SILENUS : You speak of a fair fountain , sweet to me .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Would you first taste of the unmingled wine ?</p>
   <p>SILENUS : ‘ Tis just — tasting invites the purchaser .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Here is the cup , together with the skin .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Pour : that the draught may fillip my remembrance .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : See ! 145</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Papaiapax ! what a sweet smell it has !</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : You see it then ?—</p>
   <p>SILENUS : By Jove , no ! but I smell it .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Taste , that you may not praise it in words only .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Babai ! Great Bacchus calls me forth to dance ! Joy ! joy !</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Did it flow sweetly down your throat ? 150</p>
   <p>SILENUS : So that it tingled to my very nails .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : And in addition I will give you gold .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Let gold alone ! only unlock the cask .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Bring out some cheeses now , or a young goat .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : That will I do , despising any master . 155 Yes , let me drink one cup , and I will give All that the Cyclops feed upon their mountains .</p>
   <p>...</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Ye have taken Troy and laid your hands on Helen ?</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : And utterly destroyed the race of Priam .</p>
   <p>...</p>
   <p>SILENUS : The wanton wretch ! she was bewitched to see 160 The many-coloured anklets and the chain Of woven gold which girt the neck of Paris , And so she left that good man Menelaus . There should be no more women in the world But such as are reserved for me alone .— 165 See , here are sheep , and here are goats , Ulysses , Here are unsparing cheeses of pressed milk ; Take them ; depart with what good speed ye may ; First leaving my reward , the Bacchic dew Of joy-inspiring grapes .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Ah me ! Alas ! 170 What shall we do ? the Cyclops is at hand ! Old man , we perish ! whither can we fly ?</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Hide yourselves quick within that hollow rock .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : ‘ Twere perilous to fly into the net .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : The cavern has recesses numberless ; 175 Hide yourselves quick .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : That will I never do ! The mighty Troy would be indeed disgraced If I should fly one man . How many times Have I withstood , with shield immovable . Ten thousand Phrygians !— if I needs must die , 180 Yet will I die with glory ;— if I live , The praise which I have gained will yet remain .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : What , ho ! assistance , comrades , haste , assistance !</p>
   <p>[ THE CYCLOPS , SILENUS , ULYSSES ; CHORUS . ]</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : What is this tumult ? Bacchus is not here , Nor tympanies nor brazen castanets . 185 How are my young lambs in the cavern ? Milking Their dams or playing by their sides ? And is The new cheese pressed into the bulrush baskets ? Speak ! I 'll beat some of you till you rain tears — Look up , not downwards when I speak to you . 190</p>
   <p>SILENUS : See ! I now gape at Jupiter himself ; I stare upon Orion and the stars .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Well , is the dinner fitly cooked and laid ?</p>
   <p>SILENUS : All ready , if your throat is ready too .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Are the bowls full of milk besides ?</p>
   <p>SILENUS : O'erhYpppHeNbrimming ; 195 So you may drink a tunful if you will .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Is it ewe 's milk or cow 's milk , or both mixed ?—</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Both , either ; only pray do n't swallow me .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : By no means .— ... What is this crowd I see beside the stalls ? 200 Outlaws or thieves ? for near my cavern-home I see my young lambs coupled two by two With willow bands ; mixed with my cheeses lie Their implements ; and this old fellow here Has his bald head broken with stripes .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Ah me ! 205 I have been beaten till I burn with fever .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : By whom ? Who laid his fist upon your head ?</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Those men , because I would not suffer them To steal your goods .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Did not the rascals know I am a God , sprung from the race of Heaven ? 210</p>
   <p>SILENUS : I told them so , but they bore off your things , And ate the cheese in spite of all I said , And carried out the lambs — and said , moreover , They 'd pin you down with a three-cubit collar , And pull your vitals out through your one eye , 215 Furrow your back with stripes , then , binding you , Throw you as ballast into the ship 's hold , And then deliver you , a slave , to move Enormous rocks , or found a vestibule .</p>
   <p>NOTE : 216 Furrow B .; Torture ( evidently misread for Furrow ) 1824 .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : In truth ? Nay , haste , and place in order quickly The cooking-knives , and heap upon the hearth , 221 And kindle it , a great faggot of wood .— As soon as they are slaughtered , they shall fill My belly , broiling warm from the live coals , Or boiled and seethed within the bubbling caldron . 225 I am quite sick of the wild mountain game ; Of stags and lions I have gorged enough , And I grow hungry for the flesh of men .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Nay , master , something new is very pleasant After one thing forever , and of late 230 Very few strangers have approached our cave .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Hear , Cyclops , a plain tale on the other side . We , wanting to buy food , came from our ship Into the neighbourhood of your cave , and here This old Silenus gave us in exchange 235 These lambs for wine , the which he took and drank , And all by mutual compact , without force . There is no word of truth in what he says , For slyly he was selling all your store .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : I ? May you perish , wretch —</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : If I speak false ! 240</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Cyclops , I swear by Neptune who begot thee , By mighty Triton and by Nereus old , Calypso and the glaucous Ocean Nymphs , The sacred waves and all the race of fishes — Be these the witnesses , my dear sweet master , 245 My darling little Cyclops , that I never Gave any of your stores to these false strangers ;— If I speak false may those whom most I love , My children , perish wretchedly !</p>
   <p>CHORUS : There stop ! I saw him giving these things to the strangers . 250 If I speak false , then may my father perish , But do not thou wrong hospitality .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : You lie ! I swear that he is juster far Than Rhadamanthus — I trust more in him . But let me ask , whence have ye sailed , O strangers ? 255 Who are you ? And what city nourished ye ?</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Our race is Ithacan — having destroyed The town of Troy , the tempests of the sea Have driven us on thy land , O Polypheme .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : What , have ye shared in the unenvied spoil 260 Of the false Helen , near Scamander 's stream ?</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : The same , having endured a woful toil .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Oh , basest expedition ! sailed ye not From Greece to Phrygia for one woman 's sake ?</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : ‘ Twas the Gods ’ work — no mortal was in fault . 265 But , O great Offspring of the Ocean-King , We pray thee and admonish thee with freedom , That thou dost spare thy friends who visit thee , And place no impious food within thy jaws . For in the depths of Greece we have upreared 270 Temples to thy great Father , which are all His homes . The sacred bay of Taenarus Remains inviolate , and each dim recess Scooped high on the Malean promontory , And aery Sunium 's silver-veined crag , 275 Which divine Pallas keeps unprofaned ever , The Gerastian asylums , and whate'er Within wide Greece our enterprise has kept From Phrygian contumely ; and in which You have a common care , for you inhabit 280 The skirts of Grecian land , under the roots Of Aetna and its crags , spotted with fire . Turn then to converse under human laws , Receive us shipwrecked suppliants , and provide Food , clothes , and fire , and hospitable gifts ; 285 Nor fixing upon oxen-piercing spits Our limbs , so fill your belly and your jaws . Priam 's wide land has widowed Greece enough ; And weapon-winged murder leaped together Enough of dead , and wives are husbandless , 290 And ancient women and gray fathers wail Their childless age ;— if you should roast the rest — And ‘ tis a bitter feast that you prepare — Where then would any turn ? Yet be persuaded ; Forgo the lust of your jaw-bone ; prefer 295 Pious humanity to wicked will : Many have bought too dear their evil joys .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Let me advise you , do not spare a morsel Of all his flesh . If you should eat his tongue You would become most eloquent , O Cyclops . 300</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Wealth , my good fellow , is the wise man 's God , All other things are a pretence and boast . What are my father 's ocean promontories , The sacred rocks whereon he dwells , to me ? Stranger , I laugh to scorn Jove 's thunderbolt , 305 I know not that his strength is more than mine . As to the rest I care not .— When he pours Rain from above , I have a close pavilion Under this rock , in which I lie supine , Feasting on a roast calf or some wild beast , 310 And drinking pans of milk , and gloriously Emulating the thunder of high Heaven . And when the Thracian wind pours down the snow , I wrap my body in the skins of beasts , Kindle a fire , and bid the snow whirl on . 315 The earth , by force , whether it will or no , Bringing forth grass , fattens my flocks and herds , Which , to what other God but to myself And this great belly , first of deities , Should I be bound to sacrifice ? I well know 320 The wise man 's only Jupiter is this , To eat and drink during his little day , And give himself no care . And as for those Who complicate with laws the life of man , I freely give them tears for their reward . 325 I will not cheat my soul of its delight , Or hesitate in dining upon you :— And that I may be quit of all demands , These are my hospitable gifts ;— fierce fire And yon ancestral caldron , which o'erhYpppHeNbubbling 330 Shall finely cook your miserable flesh . Creep in !—</p>
   <p>...</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Ai ! ai ! I have escaped the Trojan toils , I have escaped the sea , and now I fall Under the cruel grasp of one impious man . 335 O Pallas , Mistress , Goddess , sprung from Jove , Now , now , assist me ! Mightier toils than Troy Are these ;— I totter on the chasms of peril ;— And thou who inhabitest the thrones Of the bright stars , look , hospitable Jove , 340 Upon this outrage of thy deity , Otherwise be considered as no God !</p>
   <p>CHORUS ( ALONE ): For your gaping gulf and your gullet wide , The ravin is ready on every side , The limbs of the strangers are cooked and done ; 345 There is boiled meat , and roast meat , and meat from the coal , You may chop it , and tear it , and gnash it for fun , An hairy goat'shYpppHeNskin contains the whole . Let me but escape , and ferry me o'er The stream of your wrath to a safer shore . 350 The Cyclops Aetnean is cruel and bold , He murders the strangers That sit on his hearth , And dreads no avengers To rise from the earth . 355 He roasts the men before they are cold , He snatches them broiling from the coal , And from the caldron pulls them whole , And minces their flesh and gnaws their bone With his cursed teeth , till all be gone . 360 Farewell , foul pavilion : Farewell , rites of dread ! The Cyclops vermilion , With slaughter uncloying , Now feasts on the dead , 365 In the flesh of strangers joying !</p>

   <p>ULYSSES : O Jupiter ! I saw within the cave Horrible things ; deeds to be feigned in words , But not to be believed as being done .</p>
   <p>NOTE : 369 not to be believed B .; not believed 1824 .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : What ! sawest thou the impious Polypheme 370 Feasting upon your loved companions now ?</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Selecting two , the plumpest of the crowd , He grasped them in his hands .—</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Unhappy man !</p>
   <p>...</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Soon as we came into this craggy place , Kindling a fire , he cast on the broad hearth 375 The knotty limbs of an enormous oak , Three waggon-loads at least , and then he strewed Upon the ground , beside the red firelight , His couch of pine-leaves ; and he milked the cows , And pouring forth the white milk , filled a bowl 380 Three cubits wide and four in depth , as much As would contain ten amphorae , and bound it With ivy wreaths ; then placed upon the fire A brazen pot to boil , and made red hot The points of spits , not sharpened with the sickle 385 But with a fruit tree bough , and with the jaws Of axes for Aetnean slaughterings . And when this God-abandoned Cook of Hell Had made all ready , he seized two of us And killed them in a kind of measured manner ; 390 For he flung one against the brazen rivets Of the huge caldron , and seized the other By the foot 's tendon , and knocked out his brains Upon the sharp edge of the craggy stone : Then peeled his flesh with a great cooking-knife 395 And put him down to roast . The other 's limbs He chopped into the caldron to be boiled . And I , with the tears raining from my eyes , Stood near the Cyclops , ministering to him ; The rest , in the recesses of the cave , 400 Clung to the rock like bats , bloodless with fear . When he was filled with my companions ’ flesh , He threw himself upon the ground and sent A loathsome exhalation from his maw . Then a divine thought came to me . I filled 405 The cup of Maron , and I offered him To taste , and said :— ‘ Child of the Ocean God , Behold what drink the vines of Greece produce , The exultation and the joy of Bacchus . ’ He , satiated with his unnatural food , 410 Received it , and at one draught drank it off , And taking my hand , praised me :— ‘ Thou hast given A sweet draught after a sweet meal , dear guest . ’ And I , perceiving that it pleased him , filled Another cup , well knowing that the wine 415 Would wound him soon and take a sure revenge . And the charm fascinated him , and I Plied him cup after cup , until the drink Had warmed his entrails , and he sang aloud In concert with my wailing fellow-seamen 420 A hideous discord — and the cavern rung . I have stolen out , so that if you will You may achieve my safety and your own . But say , do you desire , or not , to fly This uncompanionable man , and dwell 425 As was your wont among the Grecian Nymphs Within the fanes of your beloved God ? Your father there within agrees to it , But he is weak and overcome with wine , And caught as if with bird-lime by the cup , 430 He claps his wings and crows in doting joy . You who are young escape with me , and find Bacchus your ancient friend ; unsuited he To this rude Cyclops .</p>

   <p>CHORUS : Oh my dearest friend , That I could see that day , and leave for ever 435 The impious Cyclops .</p>
   <p>...</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Listen then what a punishment I have For this fell monster , how secure a flight From your hard servitude .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : O sweeter far Than is the music of an Asian lyre 440 Would be the news of Polypheme destroyed .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Delighted with the Bacchic drink he goes To call his brother Cyclops — who inhabit A village upon Aetna not far off .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : I understand , catching him when alone 445 You think by some measure to dispatch him , Or thrust him from the precipice .</p>
   <p>NOTE : 446 by some measure 1824 ; with some measures B .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Oh no ; Nothing of that kind ; my device is subtle .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : How then ? I heard of old that thou wert wise .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : I will dissuade him from this plan , by saying 450 It were unwise to give the Cyclopses This precious drink , which if enjoyed alone Would make life sweeter for a longer time . When , vanquished by the Bacchic power , he sleeps , There is a trunk of olive wood within , 455 Whose point having made sharp with this good sword I will conceal in fire , and when I see It is alight , will fix it , burning yet , Within the socket of the Cyclops ’ eye And melt it out with fire — as when a man 460 Turns by its handle a great auger round , Fitting the framework of a ship with beams , So will I , in the Cyclops ’ fiery eye Turn round the brand and dry the pupil up .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Joy ! I am mad with joy at your device . 465</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : And then with you , my friends , and the old man , We 'll load the hollow depth of our black ship , And row with double strokes from this dread shore .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : May I , as in libations to a God , Share in the blinding him with the red brand ? 470 I would have some communion in his death .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Doubtless : the brand is a great brand to hold .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Oh ! I would lift an hundred waggon-loads , If like a wasp 's nest I could scoop the eye out Of the detested Cyclops .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Silence now ! 475 Ye know the close device — and when I call , Look ye obey the masters of the craft . I will not save myself and leave behind My comrades in the cave : I might escape , Having got clear from that obscure recess , 480 But ‘ twere unjust to leave in jeopardy The dear companions who sailed here with me .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Come ! who is first , that with his hand Will urge down the burning brand Through the lids , and quench and pierce 485 The Cyclops ’ eye so fiery fierce ?</p>
   <p>SEMICHORUS 1 [ SONG WITHIN ]: Listen ! listen ! he is coming , A most hideous discord humming . Drunken , museless , awkward , yelling , Far along his rocky dwelling ; 490 Let us with some comic spell Teach the yet unteachable . By all means he must be blinded , If my counsel be but minded .</p>
   <p>SEMICHORUS 2 : Happy thou made odorous 495 With the dew which sweet grapes weep , To the village hastening thus , Seek the vines that soothe to sleep ; Having first embraced thy friend , Thou in luxury without end , 500 With the strings of yellow hair , Of thy voluptuous leman fair , Shalt sit playing on a bed !— Speak ! what door is opened ?</p>

   <p>CYCLOPS : Ha ! ha ! ha ! I 'm full of wine , 505 Heavy with the joy divine , With the young feast oversated ; Like a merchant 's vessel freighted To the water 's edge , my crop Is laden to the gullet 's top . 510 The fresh meadow grass of spring Tempts me forth thus wandering To my brothers on the mountains , Who shall share the wine 's sweet fountains . Bring the cask , O stranger , bring ! 515</p>
   <p>NOTE : 508 merchant 's 1824 ; merchant B .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : One with eyes the fairest Cometh from his dwelling ; Some one loves thee , rarest Bright beyond my telling . In thy grace thou shinest 520 Like some nymph divinest In her caverns dewy :— All delights pursue thee , Soon pied flowers , sweet-breathing , Shall thy head be wreathing . 525</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Listen , O Cyclops , for I am well skilled In Bacchus , whom I gave thee of to drink .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : What sort of God is Bacchus then accounted ?</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : The greatest among men for joy of life .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : I gulped him down with very great delight . 530</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : This is a God who never injures men .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : How does the God like living in a skin ?</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : He is content wherever he is put .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Gods should not have their body in a skin .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : If he gives joy , what is his skin to you ? 535</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : I hate the skin , but love the wine within .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Stay here now : drink , and make your spirit glad .</p>
   <p>NOTE : 537 Stay here now , drink B .; stay here , now drink 1824 .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Should I not share this liquor with my brothers ?</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Keep it yourself , and be more honoured so .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : I were more useful , giving to my friends . 540</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : But village mirth breeds contests , broils , and blows .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : When I am drunk none shall lay hands on me .—</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : A drunken man is better within doors .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : He is a fool , who drinking , loves not mirth .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : But he is wise , who drunk , remains at home . 545</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : What shall I do , Silenus ? Shall I stay ?</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Stay — for what need have you of pot companions ?</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Indeed this place is closely carpeted With flowers and grass .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : And in the sun-warm noon ‘ Tis sweet to drink . Lie down beside me now , 550 Placing your mighty sides upon the ground .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : What do you put the cup behind me for ?</p>
   <p>SILENUS : That no one here may touch it .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Thievish One ! You want to drink ;— here place it in the midst . And thou , O stranger , tell how art thou called ? 555</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : My name is Nobody . What favour now Shall I receive to praise you at your hands ?</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : I 'll feast on you the last of your companions .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : You grant your guest a fair reward , O Cyclops .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Ha ! what is this ? Stealing the wine , you rogue ! 560</p>
   <p>SILENUS : It was this stranger kissing me because I looked so beautiful .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : You shall repent For kissing the coy wine that loves you not .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : By Jupiter ! you said that I am fair .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Pour out , and only give me the cup full . 565</p>
   <p>SILENUS : How is it mixed ? let me observe .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Curse you ! Give it me so .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Not till I see you wear That coronal , and taste the cup to you .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Thou wily traitor !</p>
   <p>SILENUS : But the wine is sweet . Ay , you will roar if you are caught in drinking . 570</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : See now , my lip is clean and all my beard .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Now put your elbow right and drink again . As you see me drink —...</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : How now ?</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Ye Gods , what a delicious gulp !</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Guest , take it ;— you pour out the wine for me . 575</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : The wine is well accustomed to my hand .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Pour out the wine !</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : I pour ; only be silent .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Silence is a hard task to him who drinks .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Take it and drink it off ; leave not a dreg . Oh that the drinker died with his own draught ! 580</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Papai ! the vine must be a sapient plant .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : If you drink much after a mighty feast , Moistening your thirsty maw , you will sleep well ; If you leave aught , Bacchus will dry you up .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Ho ! ho ! I can scarce rise . What pure delight ! 585 The heavens and earth appear to whirl about Confusedly . I see the throne of Jove And the clear congregation of the Gods . Now if the Graces tempted me to kiss I would not — for the loveliest of them all 590 I would not leave this Ganymede .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Polypheme , I am the Ganymede of Jupiter .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : By Jove , you are ; I bore you off from Dardanus .</p>
   <p>...</p>
   <p>[ ULYSSES AND THE CHORUS . ]</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Come , boys of Bacchus , children of high race , This man within is folded up in sleep , 595 And soon will vomit flesh from his fell maw ; The brand under the shed thrusts out its smoke , No preparation needs , but to burn out The monster 's eye ;— but bear yourselves like men .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : We will have courage like the adamant rock , 600 All things are ready for you here ; go in , Before our father shall perceive the noise .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Vulcan , Aetnean king ! burn out with fire The shining eye of this thy neighbouring monster ! And thou , O Sleep , nursling of gloomy Night , 605 Descend unmixed on this God-hated beast , And suffer not Ulysses and his comrades , Returning from their famous Trojan toils , To perish by this man , who cares not either For God or mortal ; or I needs must think 610 That Chance is a supreme divinity , And things divine are subject to her power .</p>
   <p>NOTE : 606 God-hated 1824 ; God-hating ( as an alternative ) B .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Soon a crab the throat will seize Of him who feeds upon his guest , Fire will burn his lamp-like eyes 615 In revenge of such a feast ! A great oak stump now is lying In the ashes yet undying . Come , Maron , come ! Raging let him fix the doom , 620 Let him tear the eyelid up Of the Cyclops — that his cup May be evil ! Oh ! I long to dance and revel With sweet Bromian , long desired , 625 In loved ivy wreaths attired ; Leaving this abandoned home — Will the moment ever come ?</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Be silent , ye wild things ! Nay , hold your peace , And keep your lips quite close ; dare not to breathe , 630 Or spit , or e'en wink , lest ye wake the monster , Until his eye be tortured out with fire .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Nay , we are silent , and we chaw the air .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Come now , and lend a hand to the great stake Within — it is delightfully red hot . 635</p>
   <p>CHORUS : You then command who first should seize the stake To burn the Cyclops ’ eye , that all may share In the great enterprise .</p>
   <p>SEMICHORUS 1 : We are too far ; We cannot at this distance from the door Thrust fire into his eye .</p>
   <p>SEMICHORUS 2 : And we just now 640 Have become lame ! cannot move hand or foot .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : The same thing has occurred to us ,— our ankles Are sprained with standing here , I know not how .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : What , sprained with standing still ?</p>
   <p>CHORUS : And there is dust Or ashes in our eyes , I know not whence . 645</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Cowardly dogs ! ye will not aid me then ?</p>
   <p>CHORUS : With pitying my own back and my back-bone , And with not wishing all my teeth knocked out , This cowardice comes of itself — but stay , I know a famous Orphic incantation 650 To make the brand stick of its own accord Into the skull of this one-eyed son of Earth .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Of old I knew ye thus by nature ; now I know ye better .— I will use the aid Of my own comrades . Yet though weak of hand 655 Speak cheerfully , that so ye may awaken The courage of my friends with your blithe words .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : This I will do with peril of my life , And blind you with my exhortations , Cyclops . Hasten and thrust , 660 And parch up to dust , The eye of the beast Who feeds on his guest . Burn and blind The Aetnean hind ! 665 Scoop and draw , But beware lest he claw Your limbs near his maw .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Ah me ! my eyesight is parched up to cinders .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : What a sweet paean ! sing me that again ! 670</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Ah me ! indeed , what woe has fallen upon me ! But , wretched nothings , think ye not to flee Out of this rock ; I , standing at the outlet , Will bar the way and catch you as you pass .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : What are you roaring out , Cyclops ?</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : I perish ! 675</p>
   <p>CHORUS : For you are wicked .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : And besides miserable .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : What , did you fall into the fire when drunk ?</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : ‘ Twas Nobody destroyed me .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Why then no one Can be to blame .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : I say ‘ twas Nobody Who blinded me .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Why then you are not blind . 680</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : I wish you were as blind as I am .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Nay , It cannot be that no one made you blind .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : You jeer me ; where , I ask , is Nobody ?</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Nowhere , O Cyclops .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : It was that stranger ruined me :— the wretch 685 First gave me wine and then burned out my eye , For wine is strong and hard to struggle with . Have they escaped , or are they yet within ?</p>
   <p>CHORUS : They stand under the darkness of the rock And cling to it .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : At my right hand or left ? 690</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Close on your right .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Where ?</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Near the rock itself . You have them .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Oh , misfortune on misfortune ! I 've cracked my skull .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Now they escape you — there .</p>
   <p>NOTE : 693 So B .; Now they escape you there 1824 .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Not there , although you say so .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Not on that side .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Where then ?</p>
   <p>CHORUS : They creep about you on your left . 695</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Ah ! I am mocked ! They jeer me in my ills .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Not there ! he is a little there beyond you .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Detested wretch ! where are you ?</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Far from you I keep with care this body of Ulysses .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : What do you say ? You proffer a new name . 700</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : My father named me so ; and I have taken A full revenge for your unnatural feast ; I should have done ill to have burned down Troy And not revenged the murder of my comrades .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Ai ! ai ! the ancient oracle is accomplished ; 705 It said that I should have my eyesight blinded By your coming from Troy , yet it foretold That you should pay the penalty for this By wandering long over the homeless sea .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : I bid thee weep — consider what I say ; 710 I go towards the shore to drive my ship To mine own land , o'er the Sicilian wave .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Not so , if , whelming you with this huge stone , I can crush you and all your men together ; I will descend upon the shore , though blind , 715 Groping my way adown the steep ravine .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : And we , the shipmates of Ulysses now , Will serve our Bacchus all our happy lives .</p>

   <p>SCENES FROM THE MAGICO PRODIGIOSO .</p>
   <p>FROM THE SPANISH OF CALDERON .</p>

    <head>SCENE 1 :</head>
     <l n="1">ENTER CYPRIAN , DRESSED AS A STUDENT ;</l>
     <l n="2">CLARIN AND MOSCON AS POOR SCHOLARS , WITH BOOKS .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>CYPRIAN : In the sweet solitude of this calm place , This intricate wild wilderness of trees And flowers and undergrowth of odorous plants , Leave me ; the books you brought out of the house To me are ever best society . 5 And while with glorious festival and song , Antioch now celebrates the consecration Of a proud temple to great Jupiter , And bears his image in loud jubilee To its new shrine , I would consume what still 10 Lives of the dying day in studious thought , Far from the throng and turmoil . You , my friends , Go , and enjoy the festival ; it will Be worth your pains . You may return for me When the sun seeks its grave among the billows 15 Which , among dim gray clouds on the horizon , Dance like white plumes upon a hearse ;— and here I shall expect you .</p>
   <p>NOTES : 14 So transcr . ; Be worth the labour , and return for me 1824 . 16 , 17 So 1824 ; Hid among dim gray clouds on the horizon Which dance like plumes — transcr ., Forman .</p>
   <p>MOSCON : I cannot bring my mind , Great as my haste to see the festival Certainly is , to leave you , Sir , without 20 Just saying some three or four thousand words . How is it possible that on a day Of such festivity , you can be content To come forth to a solitary country With three or four old books , and turn your back 25 On all this mirth ?</p>
   <p>NOTES : 21 thousand transcr . ; hundred 1824 . 23 be content transcr . ; bring your mind 1824 .</p>
   <p>CLARIN : My master 's in the right ; There is not anything more tiresome Than a procession day , with troops , and priests , And dances , and all that .</p>
   <p>NOTE : 28 and priests transcr . ; of men 1824 .</p>
   <p>MOSCON : From first to last , Clarin , you are a temporizing flatterer ; 30 You praise not what you feel but what he does ;— Toadeater !</p>
   <p>CLARIN : You lie — under a mistake — For this is the most civil sort of lie That can be given to a man 's face . I now Say what I think .</p>
   <p>CYPRIAN : Enough , you foolish fellows ! 35 Puffed up with your own doting ignorance , You always take the two sides of one question . Now go ; and as I said , return for me When night falls , veiling in its shadows wide This glorious fabric of the universe . 40</p>
   <p>NOTE : 36 doting ignorance transcr . ; ignorance and pride 1824 .</p>
   <p>MOSCON : How happens it , although you can maintain The folly of enjoying festivals , That yet you go there ?</p>
   <p>CLARIN : Nay , the consequence Is clear :— who ever did what he advises Others to do ?—</p>
   <p>MOSCON : Would that my feet were wings , 45 So would I fly to Livia .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>[ EXIT . ]</head>
    <head>CLARIN : To speak truth , Livia is she who has surprised my heart ; But he is more than half-way there .— Soho ! Livia , I come ; good sport , Livia , soho !</head>
    <head>[ EXIT . ]</head>
    <head>CYPRIAN : Now , since I am alone , let me examine 50 The question which has long disturbed my mind With doubt , since first I read in Plinius The words of mystic import and deep sense In which he defines God . My intellect Can find no God with whom these marks and signs 55 Fitly agree . It is a hidden truth Which I must fathom .</head>

   </lg>
   <p>NOTE : 57 Stage Direction : So transcr . Reads . Enter the Devil as a fine gentleman 1824 .</p>
   <p>DAEMON : Search even as thou wilt , But thou shalt never find what I can hide .</p>
   <p>CYPRIAN : What noise is that among the boughs ? Who moves ? What art thou ?—</p>
   <p>DAEMON : ‘ Tis a foreign gentleman . 60 Even from this morning I have lost my way In this wild place ; and my poor horse at last , Quite overcome , has stretched himself upon The enamelled tapestry of this mossy mountain , And feeds and rests at the same time . I was 65 Upon my way to Antioch upon business Of some importance , but wrapped up in cares ( Who is exempt from this inheritance ? ) I parted from my company , and lost My way , and lost my servants and my comrades . 70</p>
   <p>CYPRIAN : ‘ Tis singular that even within the sight Of the high towers of Antioch you could lose Your way . Of all the avenues and green paths Of this wild wood there is not one but leads , As to its centre , to the walls of Antioch ; 75 Take which you will , you cannot miss your road .</p>
   <p>DAEMON : And such is ignorance ! Even in the sight Of knowledge , it can draw no profit from it . But as it still is early , and as I Have no acquaintances in Antioch , 80 Being a stranger there , I will even wait The few surviving hours of the day , Until the night shall conquer it . I see Both by your dress and by the books in which You find delight and company , that you 85 Are a great student ;— for my part , I feel Much sympathy in such pursuits .</p>
   <p>NOTE : 87 in transcr . ; with 1824 .</p>
   <p>CYPRIAN : Have you Studied much ?</p>
   <p>DAEMON : No ,— and yet I know enough Not to be wholly ignorant .</p>
   <p>CYPRIAN : Pray , Sir , What science may you know ?—</p>
   <p>DAEMON : Many .</p>
   <p>CYPRIAN : Alas ! 90 Much pains must we expend on one alone , And even then attain it not ;— but you Have the presumption to assert that you Know many without study .</p>
   <p>DAEMON : And with truth . For in the country whence I come the sciences 95 Require no learning ,— they are known .</p>
   <p>NOTE : 95 come the sciences ] come sciences 1824 .</p>
   <p>CYPRIAN : Oh , would I were of that bright country ! for in this The more we study , we the more discover Our ignorance .</p>
   <p>DAEMON : It is so true , that I Had so much arrogance as to oppose 100 The chair of the most high Professorship , And obtained many votes , and , though I lost , The attempt was still more glorious , than the failure Could be dishonourable . If you believe not , Let us refer it to dispute respecting 105 That which you know the best , and although I Know not the opinion you maintain , and though It be the true one , I will take the contrary .</p>
   <p>NOTE : 106 the transcr . ; wanting , 1824 .</p>
   <p>CYPRIAN : The offer gives me pleasure . I am now Debating with myself upon a passage 110 Of Plinius , and my mind is racked with doubt To understand and know who is the God Of whom he speaks .</p>
   <p>DAEMON : It is a passage , if I recollect it right , couched in these words ‘ God is one supreme goodness , one pure essence , 115 One substance , and one sense , all sight , all hands . ’</p>
   <p>CYPRIAN : ‘ Tis true .</p>
   <p>DAEMON : What difficulty find you here ?</p>
   <p>CYPRIAN : I do not recognize among the Gods The God defined by Plinius ; if he must Be supreme goodness , even Jupiter 120 Is not supremely good ; because we see His deeds are evil , and his attributes Tainted with mortal weakness ; in what manner Can supreme goodness be consistent with The passions of humanity ?</p>
   <p>DAEMON : The wisdom 125 Of the old world masked with the names of Gods The attributes of Nature and of Man ; A sort of popular philosophy .</p>
   <p>CYPRIAN : This reply will not satisfy me , for Such awe is due to the high name of God 130 That ill should never be imputed . Then , Examining the question with more care , It follows , that the Gods would always will That which is best , were they supremely good . How then does one will one thing , one another ? 135 And that you may not say that I allege Poetical or philosophic learning :— Consider the ambiguous responses Of their oracular statues ; from two shrines Two armies shall obtain the assurance of 140 One victory . Is it not indisputable That two contending wills can never lead To the same end ? And , being opposite , If one be good , is not the other evil ? Evil in God is inconceivable ; 145 But supreme goodness fails among the Gods Without their union .</p>

   <p>CYPRIAN : That I admit ; and yet that God should not ( Falsehood is incompatible with deity ) Assure the victory ; it would be enough 155 To have permitted the defeat . If God Be all sight ,— God , who had beheld the truth , Would not have given assurance of an end Never to be accomplished : thus , although The Deity may according to his attributes 160 Be well distinguished into persons , yet Even in the minutest circumstance His essence must be one .</p>

   <p>CYPRIAN : What is this ? ye heavens for ever pure , At once intensely radiant and obscure ! Athwart the aethereal halls 25 The lightning 's arrow and the thunder-balls The day affright , As from the horizon round , Burst with earthquake sound , In mighty torrents the electric fountains ;— 30 Clouds quench the sun , and thunder-smoke Strangles the air , and fire eclipses Heaven . Philosophy , thou canst not even Compel their causes underneath thy yoke : From yonder clouds even to the waves below 35 The fragments of a single ruin choke Imagination 's flight ; For , on flakes of surge , like feathers light , The ashes of the desolation , cast Upon the gloomy blast , 40 Tell of the footsteps of the storm ; And nearer , see , the melancholy form Of a great ship , the outcast of the sea , Drives miserably ! And it must fly the pity of the port , 45 Or perish , and its last and sole resort Is its own raging enemy . The terror of the thrilling cry Was a fatal prophecy Of coming death , who hovers now 50 Upon that shattered prow , That they who die not may be dying still . And not alone the insane elements Are populous with wild portents , But that sad ship is as a miracle 55 Of sudden ruin , for it drives so fast It seems as if it had arrayed its form With the headlong storm . It strikes — I almost feel the shock ,— It stumbles on a jagged rock ,— 60 Sparkles of blood on the white foam are cast .</p>

   <p>[ THE DAEMON ENTERS , AS ESCAPED FROM THE SEA . ]</p>
   <p>DAEMON [ ASIDE ]: It was essential to my purposes To wake a tumult on the sapphire ocean , That in this unknown form I might at length Wipe out the blot of the discomfiture Sustained upon the mountain , and assail 75 With a new war the soul of Cyprian , Forging the instruments of his destruction Even from his love and from his wisdom .— O Beloved earth , dear mother , in thy bosom I seek a refuge from the monster who 80 Precipitates itself upon me .</p>
   <p>CYPRIAN : Friend , Collect thyself ; and be the memory Of thy late suffering , and thy greatest sorrow But as a shadow of the past ,— for nothing Beneath the circle of the moon , but flows 85 And changes , and can never know repose .</p>
   <p>DAEMON : And who art thou , before whose feet my fate Has prostrated me ?</p>
   <p>CYPRIAN : One who , moved with pity , Would soothe its stings .</p>
   <p>DAEMON : Oh , that can never be ! No solace can my lasting sorrows find . 90</p>
   <p>CYPRIAN : Wherefore ?</p>
   <p>DAEMON : Because my happiness is lost . Yet I lament what has long ceased to be The object of desire or memory , And my life is not life .</p>
   <p>CYPRIAN : Now , since the fury Of this earthquaking hurricane is still , 95 And the crystalline Heaven has reassumed Its windless calm so quickly , that it seems As if its heavy wrath had been awakened Only to overwhelm that vessel ,— speak , Who art thou , and whence comest thou ?</p>
   <p>DAEMON : Far more 100 My coming hither cost , than thou hast seen Or I can tell . Among my misadventures This shipwreck is the least . Wilt thou hear ?</p>
   <p>CYPRIAN : Speak .</p>
   <p>DAEMON : Since thou desirest , I will then unveil Myself to thee ;— for in myself I am 105 A world of happiness and misery ; This I have lost , and that I must lament Forever . In my attributes I stood So high and so heroically great , In lineage so supreme , and with a genius 110 Which penetrated with a glance the world Beneath my feet , that , won by my high merit , A king — whom I may call the King of kings , Because all others tremble in their pride Before the terrors of His countenance , 115 In His high palace roofed with brightest gems Of living light — call them the stars of Heaven — Named me His counsellor . But the high praise Stung me with pride and envy , and I rose In mighty competition , to ascend 120 His seat and place my foot triumphantly Upon His subject thrones . Chastised , I know The depth to which ambition falls ; too mad Was the attempt , and yet more mad were now Repentance of the irrevocable deed :— 125 Therefore I chose this ruin , with the glory Of not to be subdued , before the shame Of reconciling me with Him who reigns By coward cession .— Nor was I alone , Nor am I now , nor shall I be alone ; 130 And there was hope , and there may still be hope , For many suffrages among His vassals Hailed me their lord and king , and many still Are mine , and many more , perchance shall be . Thus vanquished , though in fact victorious , 135 I left His seat of empire , from mine eye Shooting forth poisonous lightning , while my words With inauspicious thunderings shook Heaven , Proclaiming vengeance , public as my wrong , And imprecating on His prostrate slaves 140 Rapine , and death , and outrage . Then I sailed Over the mighty fabric of the world ,— A pirate ambushed in its pathless sands , A lynx crouched watchfully among its caves And craggy shores ; and I have wandered over 145 The expanse of these wide wildernesses In this great ship , whose bulk is now dissolved In the light breathings of the invisible wind , And which the sea has made a dustless ruin , Seeking ever a mountain , through whose forests 150 I seek a man , whom I must now compel To keep his word with me . I came arrayed In tempest , and although my power could well Bridle the forest winds in their career , For other causes I forbore to soothe 155 Their fury to Favonian gentleness ; I could and would not ; [ ASIDE . ] ( thus I wake in him A love of magic art ) . Let not this tempest , Nor the succeeding calm excite thy wonder ; For by my art the sun would turn as pale 160 As his weak sister with unwonted fear ; And in my wisdom are the orbs of Heaven Written as in a record ; I have pierced The flaming circles of their wondrous spheres And know them as thou knowest every corner 165 Of this dim spot . Let it not seem to thee That I boast vainly ; wouldst thou that I work A charm over this waste and savage wood , This Babylon of crags and aged trees , Filling its leafy coverts with a horror 170 Thrilling and strange ? I am the friendless guest Of these wild oaks and pines — and as from thee I have received the hospitality Of this rude place , I offer thee the fruit Of years of toil in recompense ; whate'er 175 Thy wildest dream presented to thy thought As object of desire , that shall be thine .</p>

Let nothing meet her eyes But signs of Love 's soft victories ; 15 Let nothing meet her ear But sounds of Love 's sweet sorrow , So that from faith no succour she may borrow , But , guided by my spirit blind And in a magic snare entwined , 20 She may now seek Cyprian .

   <p>SCENE 1 .— PROLOGUE IN HEAVEN .</p>
   <p>THE LORD AND THE HOST OF HEAVEN .</p>
   <p>ENTER THREE ARCHANGELS .</p>
   <p>RAPHAEL : The sun makes music as of old Amid the rival spheres of Heaven , On its predestined circle rolled With thunder speed : the Angels even Draw strength from gazing on its glance , 5 Though none its meaning fathom may :— The world 's unwithered countenance Is bright as at Creation 's day .</p>
   <p>GABRIEL : And swift and swift , with rapid lightness , The adorned Earth spins silently , 10 Alternating Elysian brightness With deep and dreadful night ; the sea Foams in broad billows from the deep Up to the rocks , and rocks and Ocean , Onward , with spheres which never sleep , 15 Are hurried in eternal motion .</p>
   <p>MICHAEL : And tempests in contention roar From land to sea , from sea to land ; And , raging , weave a chain of power , Which girds the earth , as with a band .— 20 A flashing desolation there , Flames before the thunder 's way ; But Thy servants , Lord , revere The gentle changes of Thy day .</p>
   <p>CHORUS OF THE THREE : The Angels draw strength from Thy glance , 25 Though no one comprehend Thee may ;— Thy world 's unwithered countenance Is bright as on Creation 's day .</p>
   <p>NOTE : 28 ( RAPHAEL : The sun sounds , according to ancient custom , In the song of emulation of his brother-spheres . And its fore-written circle Fulfils with a step of thunder . Its countenance gives the Angels strength Though no one can fathom it . The incredible high works Are excellent as at the first day .</p>
   <p>GABRIEL : And swift , and inconceivably swift The adornment of earth winds itself round , And exchanges Paradise-clearness With deep dreadful night . The sea foams in broad waves From its deep bottom , up to the rocks , And rocks and sea are torn on together In the eternal swift course of the spheres .</p>
   <p>MICHAEL : And storms roar in emulation From sea to land , from land to sea , And make , raging , a chain Of deepest operation round about . There flames a flashing destruction Before the path of the thunderbolt . But Thy servants , Lord , revere The gentle alternations of Thy day .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Thy countenance gives the Angels strength , Though none can comprehend Thee : And all Thy lofty works Are excellent as at the first day .</p>
   <p>Such is a literal translation of this astonishing chorus ; it is impossible to represent in another language the melody of the versification ; even the volatile strength and delicacy of the ideas escape in the crucible of translation , and the reader is surprised to find a caput mortuum .— [ SHELLEY 'S NOTE . ])</p>
   <p>[ ENTER MEPHISTOPHELES . ]</p>
   <p>MEPHISTOPHELES : As thou , O Lord , once more art kind enough To interest Thyself in our affairs , 30 And ask , ‘ How goes it with you there below ? ’ And as indulgently at other times Thou tookest not my visits in ill part , Thou seest me here once more among Thy household . Though I should scandalize this company , 35 You will excuse me if I do not talk In the high style which they think fashionable ; My pathos certainly would make You laugh too , Had You not long since given over laughing . Nothing know I to say of suns and worlds ; 40 I observe only how men plague themselves ;— The little god o ’ the world keeps the same stamp , As wonderful as on creation 's day :— A little better would he live , hadst Thou Not given him a glimpse of Heaven 's light 45 Which he calls reason , and employs it only To live more beastlily than any beast . With reverence to Your Lordship be it spoken , He 's like one of those long-legged grasshoppers , Who flits and jumps about , and sings for ever 50 The same old song i ’ the grass . There let him lie , Burying his nose in every heap of dung .</p>
   <p>NOTES : 38 certainly would editions 1839 ; would certainly 1824 . 47 beastlily 1824 ; beastily editions 1839 .</p>
   <p>THE LORD : Have you no more to say ? Do you come here Always to scold , and cavil , and complain ? Seems nothing ever right to you on earth ? 55</p>
   <p>MEPHISTOPHELES : No , Lord ! I find all there , as ever , bad at best . Even I am sorry for man 's days of sorrow ; I could myself almost give up the pleasure Of plaguing the poor things .</p>
   <p>THE LORD : Knowest thou Faust ?</p>
   <p>MEPHISTOPHELES : The Doctor ?</p>
   <p>THE LORD : Ay ; My servant Faust .</p>
   <p>MEPHISTOPHELES : In truth 60 He serves You in a fashion quite his own ; And the fool 's meat and drink are not of earth . His aspirations bear him on so far That he is half aware of his own folly , For he demands from Heaven its fairest star , 65 And from the earth the highest joy it bears , Yet all things far , and all things near , are vain To calm the deep emotions of his breast .</p>
   <p>THE LORD : Though he now serves Me in a cloud of error , I will soon lead him forth to the clear day . 70 When trees look green , full well the gardener knows That fruits and blooms will deck the coming year .</p>
   <p>MEPHISTOPHELES : What will You bet ?— now am sure of winning — Only , observe You give me full permission To lead him softly on my path .</p>
   <p>THE LORD : As long 75 As he shall live upon the earth , so long Is nothing unto thee forbidden — Man Must err till he has ceased to struggle .</p>
   <p>MEPHISTOPHELES : Thanks . And that is all I ask ; for willingly I never make acquaintance with the dead . 80 The full fresh cheeks of youth are food for me , And if a corpse knocks , I am not at home . For I am like a cat — I like to play A little with the mouse before I eat it .</p>
   <p>THE LORD : Well , well ! it is permitted thee . Draw thou 85 His spirit from its springs ; as thou find'st power Seize him and lead him on thy downward path ; And stand ashamed when failure teaches thee That a good man , even in his darkest longings , Is well aware of the right way .</p>
   <p>MEPHISTOPHELES : Well and good . 90 I am not in much doubt about my bet , And if I lose , then ‘ tis Your turn to crow ; Enjoy Your triumph then with a full breast . Ay ; dust shall he devour , and that with pleasure , Like my old paramour , the famous Snake . 95</p>
   <p>THE LORD : Pray come here when it suits you ; for I never Had much dislike for people of your sort . And , among all the Spirits who rebelled , The knave was ever the least tedious to Me . The active spirit of man soon sleeps , and soon 100 He seeks unbroken quiet ; therefore I Have given him the Devil for a companion , Who may provoke him to some sort of work , And must create forever .— But ye , pure Children of God , enjoy eternal beauty ;— 105 Let that which ever operates and lives Clasp you within the limits of its love ; And seize with sweet and melancholy thoughts The floating phantoms of its loveliness .</p>
   <p>[ HEAVEN CLOSES ; THE ARCHANGELS EXEUNT . ]</p>
   <p>MEPHISTOPHELES : From time to time I visit the old fellow , 110 And I take care to keep on good terms with Him . Civil enough is the same God Almighty , To talk so freely with the Devil himself .</p>
   <p>SCENE 2 .— MAY-DAY NIGHT .</p>
   <p>THE HARTZ MOUNTAIN , A DESOLATE COUNTRY .</p>
   <p>FAUST , MEPHISTOPHELES .</p>
   <p>MEPHISTOPHELES : Would you not like a broomstick ? As for me I wish I had a good stout ram to ride ; For we are still far from the appointed place .</p>
   <p>FAUST : This knotted staff is help enough for me , Whilst I feel fresh upon my legs . What good 5 Is there in making short a pleasant way ? To creep along the labyrinths of the vales , And climb those rocks , where ever-babbling springs , Precipitate themselves in waterfalls , Is the true sport that seasons such a path . 10 Already Spring kindles the birchen spray , And the hoar pines already feel her breath : Shall she not work also within our limbs ?</p>
   <p>MEPHISTOPHELES : Nothing of such an influence do I feel . My body is all wintry , and I wish 15 The flowers upon our path were frost and snow . But see how melancholy rises now , Dimly uplifting her belated beam , The blank unwelcome round of the red moon , And gives so bad a light , that every step 20 One stumbles ‘ gainst some crag . With your permission , I 'll call on Ignis-fatuus to our aid : I see one yonder burning jollily . Halloo , my friend ! may I request that you Would favour us with your bright company ? 25 Why should you blaze away there to no purpose ? Pray be so good as light us up this way .</p>
   <p>IGNIS-FATUUS : With reverence be it spoken , I will try To overcome the lightness of my nature ; Our course , you know , is generally zigzag . 30</p>
   <p>MEPHISTOPHELES : Ha , ha ! your worship thinks you have to deal With men . Go straight on , in the Devil 's name , Or I shall puff your flickering life out .</p>
   <p>NOTE : 33 shall puff 1824 ; will blow 1822 .</p>
   <p>IGNIS-FATUUS : Well , I see you are the master of the house ; I will accommodate myself to you . 35 Only consider that to-night this mountain Is all enchanted , and if Jack-a-lantern Shows you his way , though you should miss your own , You ought not to be too exact with him .</p>
   <p>FAUST , MEPHISTOPHELES , AND IGNIS-FATUUS , IN ALTERNATE CHORUS : The limits of the sphere of dream , 40 The bounds of true and false , are past . Lead us on , thou wandering Gleam , Lead us onward , far and fast , To the wide , the desert waste .</p>

   <p>MEPHISTOPHELES : Now vigorously seize my skirt , and gain This pinnacle of isolated crag . One may observe with wonder from this point , 95 How Mammon glows among the mountains .</p>
   <p>FAUST : Ay — And strangely through the solid depth below A melancholy light , like the red dawn , Shoots from the lowest gorge of the abyss Of mountains , lightning hitherward : there rise 100 Pillars of smoke , here clouds float gently by ; Here the light burns soft as the enkindled air , Or the illumined dust of golden flowers ; And now it glides like tender colours spreading ; And now bursts forth in fountains from the earth ; 105 And now it winds , one torrent of broad light , Through the far valley with a hundred veins ; And now once more within that narrow corner Masses itself into intensest splendour . And near us , see , sparks spring out of the ground , 110 Like golden sand scattered upon the darkness ; The pinnacles of that black wall of mountains That hems us in are kindled .</p>
   <p>MEPHISTOPHELES : Rare : in faith ! Does not Sir Mammon gloriously illuminate His palace for this festival ?— it is 115 A pleasure which you had not known before . I spy the boisterous guests already .</p>
   <p>FAUST : How The children of the wind rage in the air ! With what fierce strokes they fall upon my neck !</p>
   <p>NOTE : 117 How 1824 ; Now 1822 .</p>
   <p>MEPHISTOPHELES : Cling tightly to the old ribs of the crag . 120 Beware ! for if with them thou warrest In their fierce flight towards the wilderness , Their breath will sweep thee into dust , and drag Thy body to a grave in the abyss . A cloud thickens the night . 125 Hark ! how the tempest crashes through the forest ! The owls fly out in strange affright ; The columns of the evergreen palaces Are split and shattered ; The roots creak , and stretch , and groan ; 130 And ruinously overthrown , The trunks are crushed and shattered By the fierce blast 's unconquerable stress . Over each other crack and crash they all In terrible and intertangled fall ; 135 And through the ruins of the shaken mountain The airs hiss and howl — It is not the voice of the fountain , Nor the wolf in his midnight prowl . Dost thou not hear ? 140 Strange accents are ringing Aloft , afar , anear ? The witches are singing ! The torrent of a raging wizard song Streams the whole mountain along . 145</p>
   <p>NOTE : 132 shattered ] scattered Rossetti .</p>
   <p>CHORUS OF WITCHES : The stubble is yellow , the corn is green , Now to the Brocken the witches go ; The mighty multitude here may be seen Gathering , wizard and witch , below .

   <p>CHORUS : Honour her , to whom honour is due , Old mother Baubo , honour to you ! An able sow , with old Baubo upon her , Is worthy of glory , and worthy of honour ! The legion of witches is coming behind , 160 Darkening the night , and outspeeding the wind —</p>
   <p>A VOICE : Which way comest thou ?</p>
   <p>A VOICE : Over Ilsenstein ; The owl was awake in the white moonshine ; I saw her at rest in her downy nest , And she stared at me with her broad , bright eyne . 165</p>

   <p>VOICES : And you may now as well take your course on to Hell , Since you ride by so fast on the headlong blast .</p>
   <p>A VOICE : She dropped poison upon me as I passed . Here are the wounds —</p>
   <p>CHORUS OF WITCHES : Come away ! come along ! The way is wide , the way is long , 170 But what is that for a Bedlam throng ? Stick with the prong , and scratch with the broom . The child in the cradle lies strangled at home , And the mother is clapping her hands .—</p>
   <p>SEMICHORUS OF WIZARDS 1 : We glide in Like snails when the women are all away ; 175 And from a house once given over to sin Woman has a thousand steps to stray .</p>

   <p>VOICES BELOW : Stay , Oh , stay !</p>
   <p>VOICES ABOVE : Out of the crannies of the rocks 190 Who calls ?</p>
   <p>VOICES BELOW : Oh , let me join your flocks ! I , three hundred years have striven To catch your skirt and mount to Heaven ,— And still in vain . Oh , might I be With company akin to me ! 195</p>
   <p>BOTH CHORUSES : Some on a ram and some on a prong , On poles and on broomsticks we flutter along ; Forlorn is the wight who can rise not to-night .</p>
   <p>A HALF-WITCH BELOW : I have been tripping this many an hour : Are the others already so far before ? 200 No quiet at home , and no peace abroad ! And less methinks is found by the road .</p>
   <p>CHORUS OF WITCHES : Come onward , away ! aroint thee , aroint ! A witch to be strong must anoint — anoint — Then every trough will be boat enough ; 205 With a rag for a sail we can sweep through the sky , Who flies not to-night , when means he to fly ?</p>
   <p>BOTH CHORUSES : We cling to the skirt , and we strike on the ground ; Witch-legions thicken around and around ; Wizard-swarms cover the heath all over . 210</p>

   <p>MEPHISTOPHELES : What ! I must exert my authority in the house . Place for young Voland ! pray make way , good people . Take hold on me , doctor , an with one step 220 Let us escape from this unpleasant crowd : They are too mad for people of my sort . Just there shines a peculiar kind of light — Something attracts me in those bushes . Come This way : we shall slip down there in a minute . 225</p>
   <p>FAUST : Spirit of Contradiction ! Well , lead on — ‘ Twere a wise feat indeed to wander out Into the Brocken upon May-day night , And then to isolate oneself in scorn , Disgusted with the humours of the time . 230</p>
   <p>MEPHISTOPHELES : See yonder , round a many-coloured flame A merry club is huddled altogether : Even with such little people as sit there One would not be alone .</p>
   <p>FAUST : Would that I were Up yonder in the glow and whirling smoke , 235 Where the blind million rush impetuously To meet the evil ones ; there might I solve Many a riddle that torments me .</p>
   <p>MEPHISTOPHELES : Yet Many a riddle there is tied anew Inextricably . Let the great world rage ! 240 We will stay here safe in the quiet dwellings . ‘ Tis an old custom . Men have ever built Their own small world in the great world of all . I see young witches naked there , and old ones Wisely attired with greater decency . 245 Be guided now by me , and you shall buy A pound of pleasure with a dram of trouble . I hear them tune their instruments — one must Get used to this damned scraping . Come , I 'll lead you Among them ; and what there you do and see , 250 As a fresh compact ‘ twixt us two shall be . How say you now ? this space is wide enough — Look forth , you cannot see the end of it — An hundred bonfires burn in rows , and they Who throng around them seem innumerable : 255 Dancing and drinking , jabbering , making love , And cooking , are at work .

I have no ribbon at my knee ; but here At home , the cloven foot is honourable . 265 See you that snail there ?— she comes creeping up , And with her feeling eyes hath smelt out something .

   <p>MINISTER : Nowadays People assert their rights : they go too far ; 280 But as for me , the good old times I praise ; Then we were all in all — ‘ twas something worth One 's while to be in place and wear a star ; That was indeed the golden age on earth .</p>
   <p>PARVENU : We too are active , and we did and do 285 What we ought not , perhaps ; and yet we now Will seize , whilst all things are whirled round and round , A spoke of Fortune 's wheel , and keep our ground .</p>
   <p>NOTE : 285 Parvenu : ( Note ) A sort of fundholder 1822 , editions 1824 , 1839 .</p>
   <p>AUTHOR : Who now can taste a treatise of deep sense And ponderous volume ? ‘ tis impertinence 290 To write what none will read , therefore will I To please the young and thoughtless people try .</p>
   <p>NOTE : 290 ponderous 1824 ; wonderous 1822 .</p>
   <p>MEPHISTOPHELES [ WHO AT ONCE APPEARS TO HAVE GROWN VERY OLD ]: I find the people ripe for the last day , Since I last came up to the wizard mountain ; And as my little cask runs turbid now , 295 So is the world drained to the dregs .</p>
   <p>PEDLAR-WITCH : Look here , Gentlemen ; do not hurry on so fast ; And lose the chance of a good pennyworth . I have a pack full of the choicest wares Of every sort , and yet in all my bundle 300 Is nothing like what may be found on earth ; Nothing that in a moment will make rich Men and the world with fine malicious mischief — There is no dagger drunk with blood ; no bowl From which consuming poison may be drained 305 By innocent and healthy lips ; no jewel , The price of an abandoned maiden 's shame ; No sword which cuts the bond it cannot loose , Or stabs the wearer 's enemy in the back ; No —</p>
   <p>MEPHISTOPHELES : Gossip , you know little of these times . 310 What has been , has been ; what is done , is past , They shape themselves into the innovations They breed , and innovation drags us with it . The torrent of the crowd sweeps over us : You think to impel , and are yourself impelled . 315</p>
   <p>FAUST : What is that yonder ?</p>
   <p>MEPHISTOPHELES : Mark her well . It is Lilith .</p>
   <p>FAUST : Who ?</p>
   <p>MEPHISTOPHELES : Lilith , the first wife of Adam . Beware of her fair hair , for she excels All women in the magic of her locks ; And when she winds them round a young man 's neck , 320 She will not ever set him free again .</p>
   <p>FAUST : There sit a girl and an old woman — they Seem to be tired with pleasure and with play .</p>
   <p>MEPHISTOPHELES : There is no rest to-night for any one : When one dance ends another is begun ; 325 Come , let us to it . We shall have rare fun .</p>
   <note>FAUST DANCES AND SINGS WITH A GIRL , AND MEPHISTOPHELES WITH AN OLD WOMAN .</note>
   <p>FAUST : I had once a lovely dream In which I saw an apple-tree , Where two fair apples with their gleam To climb and taste attracted me . 330</p>
   <p>NOTES : 327-334 So Boscombe manuscript ( “ Westminster Review ” , July , 1870 ) ; wanting , 1822 , 1824 , 1839 .</p>
   <p>THE GIRL : She with apples you desired From Paradise came long ago : With you I feel that if required , Such still within my garden grow .</p>
   <p>...</p>
   <p>PROCTO-PHANTASMIST : What is this cursed multitude about ? 335 Have we not long since proved to demonstration That ghosts move not on ordinary feet ? But these are dancing just like men and women .</p>
   <p>NOTE : 335 Procto-Phantasmist ] Brocto-Phantasmist editions 1824 , 1839 .</p>
   <p>THE GIRL : What does he want then at our ball ?</p>
   <p>FAUST : Oh ! he Is far above us all in his conceit : 340 Whilst we enjoy , he reasons of enjoyment ; And any step which in our dance we tread , If it be left out of his reckoning , Is not to be considered as a step . There are few things that scandalize him not : 345 And when you whirl round in the circle now , As he went round the wheel in his old mill , He says that you go wrong in all respects , Especially if you congratulate him Upon the strength of the resemblance .</p>
   <p>PROCTO-PHANTASMIST : Fly ! 350 Vanish ! Unheard-of impudence ! What , still there ! In this enlightened age too , since you have been Proved not to exist !— But this infernal brood Will hear no reason and endure no rule . Are we so wise , and is the POND still haunted ? 355 How long have I been sweeping out this rubbish Of superstition , and the world will not Come clean with all my pains !— it is a case Unheard of !</p>
   <p>NOTE : 355 pond wanting in Boscombe manuscript .</p>
   <p>THE GIRL : Then leave off teasing us so .</p>
   <p>PROCTO-PHANTASMIST : I tell you , spirits , to your faces now , 360 That I should not regret this despotism Of spirits , but that mine can wield it not . To-night I shall make poor work of it , Yet I will take a round with you , and hope Before my last step in the living dance 365 To beat the poet and the devil together .</p>
   <p>MEPHISTOPHELES : At last he will sit down in some foul puddle ; That is his way of solacing himself ; Until some leech , diverted with his gravity , Cures him of spirits and the spirit together . 370 [ TO FAUST , WHO HAS SECEDED FROM THE DANCE . ] Why do you let that fair girl pass from you , Who sung so sweetly to you in the dance ?</p>
   <p>FAUST : A red mouse in the middle of her singing Sprung from her mouth .</p>
   <p>MEPHISTOPHELES : That was all right , my friend : Be it enough that the mouse was not gray . 375 Do not disturb your hour of happiness With close consideration of such trifles .</p>
   <p>FAUST : Then saw I —</p>
   <p>MEPHISTOPHELES : What ?</p>
   <p>FAUST : Seest thou not a pale , Fair girl , standing alone , far , far away ? She drags herself now forward with slow steps , 380 And seems as if she moved with shackled feet : I cannot overcome the thought that she Is like poor Margaret .</p>
   <p>MEPHISTOPHELES : Let it be — pass on — No good can come of it — it is not well To meet it — it is an enchanted phantom , 385 A lifeless idol ; with its numbing look , It freezes up the blood of man ; and they Who meet its ghastly stare are turned to stone , Like those who saw Medusa .</p>
   <p>FAUST : Oh , too true ! Her eyes are like the eyes of a fresh corpse 390 Which no beloved hand has closed , alas ! That is the breast which Margaret yielded to me — Those are the lovely limbs which I enjoyed !</p>
   <p>NOTE : 392 breast editions 1839 ; heart 1822 , 1824 .</p>
   <p>MEPHISTOPHELES : It is all magic , poor deluded fool ! She looks to every one like his first love . 395</p>
   <p>FAUST : Oh , what delight ! what woe ! I cannot turn My looks from her sweet piteous countenance . How strangely does a single blood-red line , Not broader than the sharp edge of a knife , Adorn her lovely neck !</p>
   <p>MEPHISTOPHELES : Ay , she can carry 400 Her head under her arm upon occasion ; Perseus has cut it off for her . These pleasures End in delusion .— Gain this rising ground , It is as airy here as in a ... And if I am not mightily deceived , 405 I see a theatre .— What may this mean ?</p>
   <p>ATTENDANT : Quite a new piece , the last of seven , for ‘ tis The custom now to represent that number . ‘ Tis written by a Dilettante , and The actors who perform are Dilettanti ; 410 Excuse me , gentlemen ; but I must vanish . I am a Dilettante curtain-lifter .</p>
   <p>JUVENILIA .</p>
   <p>QUEEN MAB .</p>
   <p>A PHILOSOPHICAL POEM , WITH NOTES .</p>
   <p>[ An edition ( 250 copies ) of “ Queen Mab ” was printed at London in the summer of 1813 by Shelley himself , whose name , as author and printer , appears on the title-page ( see “ Bibliographical List ” ) . Of this edition about seventy copies were privately distributed . Sections 1 , 2 , 8 , and 9 were afterwards rehandled , and the intermediate sections here and there revised and altered ; and of this new text sections 1 and 2 were published by Shelley in the “ Alastor ” volume of 1816 , under the title , “ The Daemon of the World ” . The remainder lay unpublished till 1876 , when sections 8 and 9 were printed by Mr. H. Buxton Forman , C. B ., from a printed copy of “ Queen Mab ” with Shelley 's manuscript corrections . See “ The Shelley Library ” , pages 36-44 , for a description of this copy , which is in Mr. Forman 's possession . Sources of the text are ( 1 ) the editio princeps of 1813 ; ( 2 ) text ( with some omissions ) in the “ Poetical Works ” of 1839 , edited by Mrs. Shelley ; ( 3 ) text ( one line only wanting ) in the 2nd edition of the “ Poetical Works ” , 1839 ( same editor ) .</p>
   <p>“ Queen Mab ” was probably written during the year 1812 — it is first heard of at Lynmouth , August 18 , 1812 ( “ Shelley Memorials ” , page 39 ) — but the text may be assumed to include earlier material . ]</p>

   <p>KING : ‘ No cessation ! Oh ! must this last for ever ? Awful Death , 65 I wish , yet fear to clasp thee !— Not one moment Of dreamless sleep ! O dear and blessed peace ! Why dost thou shroud thy vestal purity In penury and dungeons ? wherefore lurkest With danger , death , and solitude ; yet shunn'st 70 The palace I have built thee ? Sacred peace ! Oh visit me but once , but pitying shed One drop of balm upon my withered soul . ’</p>

Hark ! yet he mutters ; His slumbers are but varied agonies , They prey like scorpions on the springs of life . There needeth not the hell that bigots frame To punish those who err : earth in itself 80 Contains at once the evil and the cure ; And all-sufficing Nature can chastise Those who transgress her law ,— she only knows How justly to proportion to the fault The punishment it merits . Is it strange 85 That this poor wretch should pride him in his woe ? Take pleasure in his abjectness , and hug The scorpion that consumes him ? Is it strange That , placed on a conspicuous throne of thorns , Grasping an iron sceptre , and immured 90 Within a splendid prison , whose stern bounds Shut him from all that 's good or dear on earth , His soul asserts not its humanity ? That man 's mild nature rises not in war Against a king 's employ ? No — ‘ tis not strange . 95 He , like the vulgar , thinks , feels , acts and lives Just as his father did ; the unconquered powers Of precedent and custom interpose Between a KING and virtue . Stranger yet , To those who know not Nature , nor deduce 100 The future from the present , it may seem , That not one slave , who suffers from the crimes Of this unnatural being ; not one wretch , Whose children famish , and whose nuptial bed Is earth 's unpitying bosom , rears an arm To dash him from his throne ! 105 Those gilded flies That , basking in the sunshine of a court , Fatten on its corruption !— what are they ? — The drones of the community ; they feed On the mechanic 's labour : the starved hind 110 For them compels the stubborn glebe to yield Its unshared harvests ; and yon squalid form , Leaner than fleshless misery , that wastes A sunless life in the unwholesome mine , Drags out in labour a protracted death , 115 To glut their grandeur ; many faint with toil , That few may know the cares and woe of sloth .</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Beyond our atmosphere the sun would appear a rayless orb of fire in the midst of a black concave . The equal diffusion of its light on earth is owing to the refraction of the rays by the atmosphere , and their reflection from other bodies . Light consists either of vibrations propagated through a subtle medium , or of numerous minute particles repelled in all directions from the luminous body . Its velocity greatly exceeds that of any substance with which we are acquainted : observations on the eclipses of Jupiter 's satellites have demonstrated that light takes up no more than 8 minutes 7 seconds in passing from the sun to the earth , a distance of 95 , 000 , 000 miles .— Some idea may be gained of the immense distance of the fixed stars when it is computed that many years would elapse before light could reach this earth from the nearest of them ; yet in one year light travels 5 , 422 , 400 , 000 , 000 miles , which is a distance 5 , 707 , 600 times greater than that of the sun from the earth .</p>

   <p>The plurality of worlds ,— the indefinite immensity of the universe , is a most awful subject of contemplation . He who rightly feels its mystery and grandeur is in no danger of seduction from the falsehoods of religious systems , or of deifying the principle of the universe . It is impossible to believe that the Spirit that pervades this infinite machine begat a son upon the body of a Jewish woman ; or is angered at the consequences of that necessity , which is a synonym of itself . All that miserable tale of the Devil , and Eve , and an Intercessor , with the childish mummeries of the God of the Jews , is irreconcilable with the knowledge of the stars . The works of His fingers have borne witness against Him .</p>
   <p>The nearest of the fixed stars is inconceivably distant from the earth , and they are probably proportionably distant from each other . By a calculation of the velocity of light , Sirius is supposed to be at least 54 , 224 , 000 , 000 , 000 miles from the earth . ( See Nicholson 's “ Encyclopedia ” , article Light . ) That which appears only like a thin and silvery cloud streaking the heaven is in effect composed of innumerable clusters of suns , each shining with its own light , and illuminating numbers of planets that revolve around them . Millions and millions of suns are ranged around us , all attended by innumerable worlds , yet calm , regular , and harmonious , all keeping the paths of immutable necessity .</p>

   <p>To employ murder as a means of justice is an idea which a man of an enlightened mind will not dwell upon with pleasure . To march forth in rank and file , and all the pomp of streamers and trumpets , for the purpose of shooting at our fellow-men as a mark ; to inflict upon them all the variety of wound and anguish ; to leave them weltering in their blood ; to wander over the field of desolation , and count the number of the dying and the dead ,— are employments which in thesis we may maintain to be necessary , but which no good man will contemplate with gratulation and delight . A battle we suppose is won :— thus truth is established , thus the cause of justice is confirmed ! It surely requires no common sagacity to discern the connexion between this immense heap of calamities and the assertion of truth or the maintenance of justice .</p>
   <p>‘ Kings , and ministers of state , the real authors of the calamity , sit unmolested in their cabinet , while those against whom the fury of the storm is directed are , for the most part , persons who have been trepanned into the service , or who are dragged unwillingly from their peaceful homes into the field of battle . A soldier is a man whose business it is to kill those who never offended him , and who are the innocent martyrs of other men 's iniquities . Whatever may become of the abstract question of the justifiableness of war , it seems impossible that the soldier should not be a depraved and unnatural being .</p>
   <p>To these more serious and momentous considerations it may be proper to add a recollection of the ridiculousness of the military character . Its first constituent is obedience : a soldier is , of all descriptions of men , the most completely a machine ; yet his profession inevitably teaches him something of dogmatism , swaggering , and sell-consequence : he is like the puppet of a showman , who , at the very time he is made to strut and swell and display the most farcical airs , we perfectly know cannot assume the most insignificant gesture , advance either to the right or the left , but as he is moved by his exhibitor . ’ — Godwin 's “ Enquirer ” , Essay 5 .</p>

   <p>FALSEHOOD : Brother ! arise from the dainty fare , Which thousands have toiled and bled to bestow ; A finer feast for thy hungry ear Is the news that I bring of human woe .</p>
   <p>VICE : And , secret one , what hast thou done , To compare , in thy tumid pride , with me ? I , whose career , through the blasted year , Has been tracked by despair and agony .</p>
   <p>FALSEHOOD : What have I done !— I have torn the robe From baby Truth 's unsheltered form , And round the desolated globe Borne safely the bewildering charm : My tyrant-slaves to a dungeon-floor Have bound the fearless innocent , And streams of fertilizing gore Flow from her bosom 's hideous rent , Which this unfailing dagger gave ... I dread that blood !— no more — this day Is ours , though her eternal ray Must shine upon our grave . Yet know , proud Vice , had I not given To thee the robe I stole from Heaven , Thy shape of ugliness and fear Had never gained admission here .</p>
   <p>VICE : And know , that had I disdained to toil , But sate in my loathsome cave the while , And ne'er to these hateful sons of Heaven , GOLD , MONARCHY , and MURDER , given ; Hadst thou with all thine art essayed One of thy games then to have played , With all thine overweening boast , Falsehood ! I tell thee thou hadst lost !— Yet wherefore this dispute ?— we tend , Fraternal , to one common end ; In this cold grave beneath my feet , Will our hopes , our fears , and our labours , meet .</p>
   <p>FALSEHOOD : I brought my daughter , RELIGION , on earth : She smothered Reason 's babes in their birth ; But dreaded their mother 's eye severe ,— So the crocodile slunk off slily in fear , And loosed her bloodhounds from the den .... They started from dreams of slaughtered men , And , by the light of her poison eye , Did her work o'er the wide earth frightfully : The dreadful stench of her torches ’ flare , Fed with human fat , polluted the air : The curses , the shrieks , the ceaseless cries Of the many-mingling miseries , As on she trod , ascended high And trumpeted my victory !— Brother , tell what thou hast done .</p>
   <p>VICE : I have extinguished the noonday sun , In the carnage-smoke of battles won : Famine , Murder , Hell and Power Were glutted in that glorious hour Which searchless fate had stamped for me With the seal of her security ... For the bloated wretch on yonder throne Commanded the bloody fray to rise . Like me he joyed at the stifled moan Wrung from a nation 's miseries ; While the snakes , whose slime even him DEFILED , In ecstasies of malice smiled : They thought ‘ twas theirs ,— but mine the deed ! Theirs is the toil , but mine the meed — Ten thousand victims madly bleed . They dream that tyrants goad them there With poisonous war to taint the air : These tyrants , on their beds of thorn , Swell with the thoughts of murderous fame , And with their gains to lift my name Restless they plan from night to morn : I — I do all ; without my aid Thy daughter , that relentless maid , Could never o'er a death-bed urge The fury of her venomed scourge .</p>
   <p>FALSEHOOD : Brother , well :— the world is ours ; And whether thou or I have won , The pestilence expectant lowers On all beneath yon blasted sun . Our joys , our toils , our honours meet In the milk-white and wormy winding-sheet : A short-lived hope , unceasing care , Some heartless scraps of godly prayer , A moody curse , and a frenzied sleep Ere gapes the grave 's unclosing deep , A tyrant 's dream , a coward 's start , The ice that clings to a priestly heart , A judge 's frown , a courtier 's smile , Make the great whole for which we toil ; And , brother , whether thou or I Have done the work of misery , It little boots : thy toil and pain , Without my aid , were more than vain ; And but for thee I ne'er had sate The guardian of Heaven 's palace gate .</p>

     <l n="28">Of wealth !</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>There is no real wealth but the labour of man . Were the mountains of gold and the valleys of silver , the world would not be one grain of corn the richer ; no one comfort would be added to the human race . In consequence of our consideration for the precious metals , one man is enabled to heap to himself luxuries at the expense of the necessaries of his neighbour ; a system admirably fitted to produce all the varieties of disease and crime , which never fail to characterize the two extremes of opulence and penury . A speculator takes pride to himself as the promoter of his country 's prosperity , who employs a number of hands in the manufacture of articles avowedly destitute of use , or subservient only to the unhallowed cravings of luxury and ostentation . The nobleman , who employs the peasants of his neighbourhood in building his palaces , until ‘ jam pauca aratro jugera regiae moles relinquunt , ’ flatters himself that he has gained the title of a patriot by yielding to the impulses of vanity . The show and pomp of courts adduce the same apology for its continuance ; and many a fete has been given , many a woman has eclipsed her beauty by her dress , to benefit the labouring poor and to encourage trade . Who does not see that this is a remedy which aggravates whilst it palliates the countless diseases of society ? The poor are set to labour ,— for what ? Not the food for which they famish : not the blankets for want of which their babes are frozen by the cold of their miserable hovels : not those comforts of civilization without which civilized man is far more miserable than the meanest savage ; oppressed as he is by all its insidious evils , within the daily and taunting prospect of its innumerable benefits assiduously exhibited before him :— no ; for the pride of power , for the miserable isolation of pride , for the false pleasures of the hundredth part of society . No greater evidence is afforded of the wide extended and radical mistakes of civilized man than this fact : those arts which are essential to his very being are held in the greatest contempt ; employments are lucrative in an inverse ratio to their usefulness ( See Rousseau , “ De l'Inegalite parmi les Hommes ” , note 7 . ): the jeweller , the toyman , the actor gains fame and wealth by the exercise of his useless and ridiculous art ; whilst the cultivator of the earth , he without whom society must cease to subsist , struggles through contempt and penury , and perishes by that famine which but for his unceasing exertions would annihilate the rest of mankind .</p>
   <p>I will not insult common sense by insisting on the doctrine of the natural equality of man . The question is not concerning its desirableness , but its practicability : so far as it is practicable , it is desirable . That state of human society which approaches nearer to an equal partition of its benefits and evils should , caeteris paribus , be preferred : but so long as we conceive that a wanton expenditure of human labour , not for the necessities , not even for the luxuries of the mass of society , but for the egotism and ostentation of a few of its members , is defensible on the ground of public justice , so long we neglect to approximate to the redemption of the human race .</p>
   <p>Labour is required for physical , and leisure for moral improvement : from the former of these advantages the rich , and from the latter the poor , by the inevitable conditions of their respective situations , are precluded . A state which should combine the advantages of both would be subjected to the evils of neither . He that is deficient in firm health , or vigorous intellect , is but half a man : hence it follows that to subject the labouring classes to unnecessary labour is wantonly depriving them of any opportunities of intellectual improvement ; and that the rich are heaping up for their own mischief the disease , lassitude , and ennui by which their existence is rendered an intolerable burthen .</p>
   <p>English reformers exclaim against sinecures ,— but the true pension list is the rent-roll of the landed proprietors : wealth is a power usurped by the few , to compel the many to labour for their benefit . The laws which support this system derive their force from the ignorance and credulity of its victims : they are the result of a conspiracy of the few against the many , who are themselves obliged to purchase this pre-eminence by the loss of all real comfort .</p>
   <p>‘ The commodities that substantially contribute to the subsistence of the human species form a very short catalogue : they demand from us but a slender portion of industry . If these only were produced , and sufficiently produced , the species of man would be continued . If the labour necessarily required to produce them were equitably divided among the poor , and , still more , if it were equitably divided among all , each man 's share of labour would be light , and his portion of leisure would be ample . There was a time when this leisure would have been of small comparative value : it is to be hoped that the time will come when it will be applied to the most important purposes . Those hours which are not required for the production of the necessaries of life may be devoted to the cultivation of the understanding , the enlarging our stock of knowledge , the refining our taste , and thus opening to us new and more exquisite sources of enjoyment .</p>
   <p>...</p>
   <p>‘ It was perhaps necessary that a period of monopoly and oppression should subsist , before a period of cultivated equality could subsist . Savages perhaps would never have been excited to the discovery of truth and the invention of art but by the narrow motives which such a period affords . But surely , after the savage state has ceased , and men have set out in the glorious career of discovery and invention , monopoly and oppression cannot be necessary to prevent them from returning to a state of barbarism . ’ — Godwin 's “ Enquirer ” , Essay 2 . See also “ Pol . Jus . ” , book 8 , chapter 2 .</p>
   <p>It is a calculation of this admirable author , that all the conveniences of civilized life might be produced , if society would divide the labour equally among its members , by each individual being employed in labour two hours during the day .</p>

     <l n="4">Even love is sold .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Not even the intercourse of the sexes is exempt from the despotism of positive institution . Law pretends even to govern the indisciplinable wanderings of passion , to put fetters on the clearest deductions of reason , and , by appeals to the will , to subdue the involuntary affections of our nature . Love is inevitably consequent upon the perception of loveliness . Love withers under constraint : its very essence is liberty : it is compatible neither with obedience , jealousy , nor fear : it is there most pure , perfect , and unlimited , where its votaries live in confidence , equality , and unreserve .</p>
   <p>How long then ought the sexual connection to last ? what law ought to specify the extent of the grievances which should limit its duration ? A husband and wife ought to continue so long united as they love each other : any law which should bind them to cohabitation for one moment after the decay of their affection would be a most intolerable tyranny , and the most unworthy of toleration . How odious an usurpation of the right of private judgement should that law be considered which should make the ties of friendship indissoluble , in spite of the caprices , the inconstancy , the fallibility , and capacity for improvement of the human mind . And by so much would the fetters of love be heavier and more unendurable than those of friendship , as love is more vehement and capricious , more dependent on those delicate peculiarities of imagination , and less capable of reduction to the ostensible merits of the object .</p>
   <p>The state of society in which we exist is a mixture of feudal savageness and imperfect civilization . The narrow and unenlightened morality of the Christian religion is an aggravation of these evils . It is not even until lately that mankind have admitted that happiness is the sole end of the science of ethics , as of all other sciences ; and that the fanatical idea of mortifying the flesh for the love of God has been discarded . I have heard , indeed , an ignorant collegian adduce , in favour of Christianity , its hostility to every worldly feeling ! ( The first Christian emperor made a law by which seduction was punished with death ; if the female pleaded her own consent , she also was punished with death ; if the parents endeavoured to screen the criminals , they were banished and their estates were confiscated ; the slaves who might be accessory were burned alive , or forced to swallow melted lead . The very offspring of an illegal love were involved in the consequences of the sentence .— Gibbon 's “ Decline and Fall ” , etc ., volume 2 , page 210 . See also , for the hatred of the primitive Christians to love and even marriage , page 269 . )</p>
   <p>But if happiness be the object of morality , of all human unions and disunions ; if the worthiness of every action is to be estimated by the quantity of pleasurable sensation it is calculated to produce , then the connection of the sexes is so long sacred as it contributes to the comfort of the parties , and is naturally dissolved when its evils are greater than its benefits . There is nothing immoral in this separation . Constancy has nothing virtuous in itself , independently of the pleasure it confers , and partakes of the temporizing spirit of vice in proportion as it endures tamely moral defects of magnitude in the object of its indiscreet choice . Love is free : to promise for ever to love the same woman is not less absurd than to promise to believe the same creed : such a vow , in both cases , excludes us from all inquiry . The language of the votarist is this : The woman I now love may be infinitely inferior to many others ; the creed I now profess may be a mass of errors and absurdities ; but I exclude myself from all future information as to the amiability of the one and the truth of the other , resolving blindly , and in spite of conviction , to adhere to them . Is this the language of delicacy and reason ? Is the love of such a frigid heart of more worth than its belief ?</p>
   <p>The present system of constraint does no more , in the majority of instances , than make hypocrites or open enemies . Persons of delicacy and virtue , unhappily united to one whom they find it impossible to love , spend the loveliest season of their life in unproductive efforts to appear otherwise than they are , for the sake of the feelings of their partner or the welfare of their mutual offspring : those of less generosity and refinement openly avow their disappointment , and linger out the remnant of that union , which only death can dissolve , in a state of incurable bickering and hostility . The early education of their children takes its colour from the squabbles of the parents ; they are nursed in a systematic school of ill-humour , violence , and falsehood . Had they been suffered to part at the moment when indifference rendered their union irksome , they would have been spared many years of misery : they would have connected themselves more suitably , and would have found that happiness in the society of more congenial partners which is for ever denied them by the despotism of marriage . They would have been separately useful and happy members of society , who , whilst united , were miserable and rendered misanthropical by misery . The conviction that wedlock is indissoluble holds out the strongest of all temptations to the perverse : they indulge without restraint in acrimony , and all the little tyrannies of domestic life , when they know that their victim is without appeal . If this connection were put on a rational basis , each would be assured that habitual ill-temper would terminate in separation , and would check this vicious and dangerous propensity .</p>
   <p>Prostitution is the legitimate offspring of marriage and its accompanying errors . Women , for no other crime than having followed the dictates of a natural appetite , are driven with fury from the comforts and sympathies of society . It is less venial than murder ; and the punishment which is inflicted on her who destroys her child to escape reproach is lighter than the life of agony and disease to which the prostitute is irrecoverably doomed . Has a woman obeyed the impulse of unerring nature ;— society declares war against her , pitiless and eternal war : she must be the tame slave , she must make no reprisals ; theirs is the right of persecution , hers the duty of endurance . She lives a life of infamy : the loud and bitter laugh of scorn scares her from all return . She dies of long and lingering disease : yet SHE is in fault , SHE is the criminal , SHE the froward and untamable child ,— and society , forsooth , the pure and virtuous matron , who casts her as an abortion from her undefiled bosom ! Society avenges herself on the criminals of her own creation ; she is employed in anathematizing the vice to-day , which yesterday she was the most zealous to teach . Thus is formed one-tenth of the population of London : meanwhile the evil is twofold . Young men , excluded by the fanatical idea of chastity from the society of modest and accomplished women , associate with these vicious and miserable beings , destroying thereby all those exquisite and delicate sensibilities whose existence cold-hearted worldlings have denied ; annihilating all genuine passion , and debasing that to a selfish feeling which is the excess of generosity and devotedness . Their body and mind alike crumble into a hideous wreck of humanity ; idiocy and disease become perpetuated in their miserable offspring , and distant generations suffer for the bigoted morality of their forefathers . Chastity is a monkish and evangelical superstition , a greater foe to natural temperance even than unintellectual sensuality ; it strikes at the root of all domestic happiness , and consigns more than half of the human race to misery , that some few may monopolize according to law . A system could not well have been devised more studiously hostile to human happiness than marriage .</p>
   <p>I conceive that from the abolition of marriage , the fit and natural arrangement of sexual connection would result . I by no means assert that the intercourse would be promiscuous : on the contrary , it appears , from the relation of parent to child , that this union is generally of long duration , and marked above all others with generosity and self-devotion . But this is a subject which it is perhaps premature to discuss . That which will result from the abolition of marriage will be natural and right ; because choice and change will be exempted from restraint .</p>
   <p>In fact , religion and morality , as they now stand , compose a practical code of misery and servitude : the genius of human happiness must tear every leaf from the accursed book of God ere man can read the inscription on his heart . How would morality , dressed up in stiff stays and finery , start from her own disgusting image should she look in the mirror of nature !—</p>

   <p>The north polar star , to which the axis of the earth , in its present state of obliquity , points . It is exceedingly probable , from many considerations , that this obliquity will gradually diminish , until the equator coincides with the ecliptic : the nights and days will then become equal on the earth throughout the year , and probably the seasons also . There is no great extravagance in presuming that the progress of the perpendicularity of the poles may be as rapid as the progress of intellect ; or that there should be a perfect identity between the moral and physical improvement of the human species . It is certain that wisdom is not compatible with disease , and that , in the present state of the climates of the earth , health , in the true and comprehensive sense of the word , is out of the reach of civilized man . Astronomy teaches us that the earth is now in its progress , and that the poles are every year becoming more and more perpendicular to the ecliptic . The strong evidence afforded by the history of mythology , and geological researches , that some event of this nature has taken place already , affords a strong presumption that this progress is not merely an oscillation , as has been surmised by some late astronomers . ( Laplace , “ Systeme du Monde ” . )</p>
   <p>Bones of animals peculiar to the torrid zone have been found in the north of Siberia , and on the banks of the river Ohio .

( Cabanis , “ Rapports du Physique et du Moral de l'Homme ” , volume 2 page 406 . ) The researches of M. Bailly establish the existence of a people who inhabited a tract in Tartary 49 degrees north latitude , of greater antiquity than either the Indians , the Chinese , or the Chaldeans , from whom these nations derived their sciences and theology . ( Bailly , “ Lettres sur les Sciences , a Voltaire ” . ) We find , from the testimony of ancient writers , that Britain , Germany , and France were much colder than at present , and that their great rivers were annually frozen over . Astronomy teaches us also that since this period the obliquity of the earth 's position has been considerably diminished .</p>

The idea of necessity is obtained by our experience of the connection between objects , the uniformity of the operations of nature , the constant conjunction of similar events , and the consequent inference of one from the other . Mankind are therefore agreed in the admission of necessity , if they admit that these two circumstances take place in voluntary action . Motive is to voluntary action in the human mind what cause is to effect in the material universe . The word liberty , as applied to mind , is analogous to the word chance as applied to matter : they spring from an ignorance of the certainty of the conjunction of antecedents and consequents .</p>
   <p>Every human being is irresistibly impelled to act precisely as he does act : in the eternity which preceded his birth a chain of causes was generated , which , operating under the name of motives , make it impossible that any thought of his mind , or any action of his life , should be otherwise than it is . Were the doctrine of Necessity false , the human mind would no longer be a legitimate object of science ; from like causes it would be in vain that we should expect like effects ; the strongest motive would no longer be paramount over the conduct ; all knowledge would be vague and undeterminate ; we could not predict with any certainty that we might not meet as an enemy to-morrow him with whom we have parted in friendship to-night ; the most probable inducements and the clearest reasonings would lose the invariable influence they possess . The contrary of this is demonstrably the fact . Similar circumstances produce the same unvariable effects . The precise character and motives of any man on any occasion being given , the moral philosopher could predict his actions with as much certainty as the natural philosopher could predict the effects of the mixture of any particular chemical substances . Why is the aged husbandman more experienced than the young beginner ? Because there is a uniform , undeniable necessity in the operations of the material universe . Why is the old statesman more skilful than the raw politician ) Because , relying on the necessary conjunction of motive and action , he proceeds to produce moral effects , by the application of those moral causes which experience has shown to be effectual . Some actions may be found to which we can attach no motives , but these are the effects of causes with which we are unacquainted . Hence the relation which motive bears to voluntary action is that of cause to effect ; nor , placed in this point of view , is it , or ever has it been , the subject of popular or philosophical dispute . None but the few fanatics who are engaged in the herculean task of reconciling the justice of their God with the misery of man , will longer outrage common sense by the supposition of an event without a cause , a voluntary action without a motive . History , politics , morals , criticism , all grounds of reasonings , all principles of science , alike assume the truth of the doctrine of Necessity . No farmer carrying his corn to market doubts the sale of it at the market price . The master of a manufactory no more doubts that he can purchase the human labour necessary for his purposes than that his machinery will act as they have been accustomed to act .</p>
   <p>But , whilst none have scrupled to admit necessity as influencing matter , many have disputed its dominion over mind . Independently of its militating with the received ideas of the justice of God , it is by no means obvious to a superficial inquiry . When the mind observes its own operations , it feels no connection of motive and action : but as we know ‘ nothing more of causation than the constant conjunction of objects and the consequent inference of one from the other , as we find that these two circumstances are universally allowed to have place in voluntary action , we may be easily led to own that they are subjected to the necessity common to all causes . ’ The actions of the will have a regular conjunction with circumstances and characters ; motive is to voluntary action what cause is to effect . But the only idea we can form of causation is a constant conjunction of similar objects , and the consequent inference of one from the other : wherever this is the case necessity is clearly established .</p>
   <p>The idea of liberty , applied metaphorically to the will , has sprung from a misconception of the meaning of the word power . What is power ?— id quod potest , that which can produce any given effect . To deny power is to say that nothing can or has the power to be or act . In the only true sense of the word power , it applies with equal force to the lodestone as to the human will . Do you think these motives , which I shall present , are powerful enough to rouse him ? is a question just as common as , Do you think this lever has the power of raising this weight ? The advocates of free-will assert that the will has the power of refusing to be determined by the strongest motive ; but the strongest motive is that which , overcoming all others , ultimately prevails ; this assertion therefore amounts to a denial of the will being ultimately determined by that motive which does determine it , which is absurd . But it is equally certain that a man cannot resist the strongest motive as that he cannot overcome a physical impossibility .</p>
   <p>The doctrine of Necessity tends to introduce a great change into the established notions of morality , and utterly to destroy religion . Reward and punishment must be considered , by the Necessarian , merely as motives which he would employ in order to procure the adoption or abandonment of any given line of conduct . Desert , in the present sense of the word , would no longer have any meaning ; and he who should inflict pain upon another for no better reason than that he deserved it , would only gratify his revenge under pretence of satisfying justice ? It is not enough , says the advocate of free-will , that a criminal should be prevented from a repetition of his crime : he should feel pain , and his torments , when justly inflicted , ought precisely to be proportioned to his fault . But utility is morality ; that which is incapable of producing happiness is useless ; and though the crime of Damiens must be condemned , yet the frightful torments which revenge , under the name of justice , inflicted on this unhappy man cannot be supposed to have augmented , even at the long run , the stock of pleasurable sensation in the world . At the same time , the doctrine of Necessity does not in the least diminish our disapprobation of vice . The conviction which all feel that a viper is a poisonous animal , and that a tiger is constrained , by the inevitable condition of his existence , to devour men , does not induce us to avoid them lass sedulously , or , even more , to hesitate in destroying them : but he would surely be of a hard heart who , meeting with a serpent on a desert island , or in a situation where it was incapable of injury , should wantonly deprive it of existence . A Necessarian is inconsequent to his own principles if he indulges in hatred or contempt ; the compassion which he feels for the criminal is unmixed with a desire of injuring him : he looks with an elevated and dreadless composure upon the links of the universal chain as they pass before his eyes ; whilst cowardice , curiosity , and inconsistency only assail him in proportion to the feebleness and indistinctness with which he has perceived and rejected the delusions of free-will .</p>
   <p>Religion is the perception of the relation in which we stand to the principle of the universe . But if the principle of the universe be not an organic being , the model and prototype of man , the relation between it and human beings is absolutely none . Without some insight into its will respecting our actions religion is nugatory and vain . But will is only a mode of animal mind ; moral qualities also are such as only a human being can possess ; to attribute them to the principle of the universe is to annex to it properties incompatible with any possible definition of its nature . It is probable that the word God was originally only an expression denoting the unknown cause of the known events which men perceived in the universe . By the vulgar mistake of a metaphor for a real being , of a word for a thing , it became a man , endowed with human qualities and governing the universe as an earthly monarch governs his kingdom . Their addresses to this imaginary being , indeed , are much in the same style as those of subjects to a king . They acknowledge his benevolence , deprecate his anger , and supplicate his favour .</p>
   <p>But the doctrine of Necessity teaches us that in no case could any event have happened otherwise than it did happen , and that , if God is the author of good , He is also the author of evil ; that , if He is entitled to our gratitude for the one , He is entitled to our hatred for the other ; that , admitting the existence of this hypothetic being , He is also subjected to the dominion of an immutable necessity . It is plain that the same arguments which prove that God is the author of food , light , and life , prove Him also to be the author of poison , darkness , and death . The wide-wasting earthquake , the storm , the battle , and the tyranny , are attributable to this hypothetic being in the same degree as the fairest forms of nature , sunshine , liberty , and peace .</p>
   <p>But we are taught , by the doctrine of Necessity , that there is neither good nor evil in the universe , otherwise than as the events to which we apply these epithets have relation to our own peculiar mode of being . Still less than with the hypothesis of a God will the doctrine of Necessity accord with the belief of a future state of punishment . God made man such as he is , and than damned him for being so : for to say that God was the author of all good , and man the author of all evil , is to say that one man made a straight line and a crooked one , and another man made the incongruity .</p>
   <p>A Mahometan story , much to the present purpose , is recorded , wherein Adam and Moses are introduced disputing before God in the following manner . Thou , says Moses , art Adam , whom God created , and animated with the breath of life , and caused to be worshipped by the angels , and placed in Paradise , from whence mankind have been expelled for thy fault . Whereto Adam answered , Thou art Moses , whom God chose for His apostle , and entrusted with His word , by giving thee the tables of the law , and whom He vouchsafed to admit to discourse with Himself . How many years dost thou find the law was written before I was created ? Says Moses , Forty . And dost thou not find , replied Adam , these words therein , And Adam rebelled against his Lord and transgressed ? Which Moses confessing , Dost thou therefore blame me , continued he , for doing that which God wrote of me that I should do , forty years before I was created , nay , for what was decreed concerning me fifty thousand years before the creation of heaven and earth ?— Sale 's “ Prelim . Disc . to the Koran ” , page 164 .</p>
   <p>7 . 13 :—</p>
   <p>There is no God .</p>
   <p>This negation must be understood solely to affect a creative Deity . The hypothesis of a pervading Spirit co-eternal with the universe remains unshaken .</p>
   <p>A close examination of the validity of the proofs adduced to support any proposition is the only secure way of attaining truth , on the advantages of which it is unnecessary to descant : our knowledge of the existence of a Deity is a subject of such importance that it cannot be too minutely investigated ; in consequence of this conviction we proceed briefly and impartially to examine the proofs which have been adduced . It is necessary first to consider the nature of belief .</p>
   <p>When a proposition is offered to the mind , it perceives the agreement or disagreement of the ideas of which it is composed . A perception of their agreement is termed BELIEF . Many obstacles frequently prevent this perception from being immediate ; these the mind attempts to remove in order that the perception may be distinct . The mind is active in the investigation in order to perfect the state of perception of the relation which the component ideas of the proposition bear to each , which is passive : the investigation being confused with the perception has induced many falsely to imagine that the mind is active in belief ,— that belief is an act of volition ,— in consequence of which it may be regulated by the mind . Pursuing , continuing this mistake , they have attached a degree of criminality to disbelief ; of which , in its nature , it is incapable : it is equally incapable of merit .</p>
   <p>Belief , then , is a passion , the strength of which , like every other passion , is in precise proportion to the degrees of excitement .</p>
   <p>The degrees of excitement are three .</p>
   <p>The senses are the sources of all knowledge to the mind ; consequently their evidence claims the strongest assent .</p>
   <p>The decision of the mind , founded upon our own experience , derived from these sources , claims the next degree .</p>
   <p>The experience of others , which addresses itself to the former one , occupies the lowest degree .</p>
   <p>( A graduated scale , on which should be marked the capabilities of propositions to approach to the test of the senses , would be a just barometer of the belief which ought to be attached to them . )</p>
   <p>Consequently no testimony can be admitted which is contrary to reason ; reason is founded on the evidence of our senses .</p>
   <p>Every proof may be referred to one of these three divisions : it is to be considered what arguments we receive from each of them , which should convince us of the existence of a Deity .</p>
   <p>1st , The evidence of the senses . If the Deity should appear to us , if He should convince our senses of His existence , this revelation would necessarily command belief . Those to whom the Deity has thus appeared have the strongest possible conviction of His existence . But the God of Theologians is incapable of local visibility .</p>
   <p>2d , Reason . It is urged that man knows that whatever is must either have had a beginning , or have existed from all eternity : he also knows that whatever is not eternal must have had a cause . When this reasoning is applied to the universe , it is necessary to prove that it was created : until that is clearly demonstrated we may reasonably suppose that it has endured from all eternity . We must prove design before we can infer a designer . The only idea which we can form of causation is derivable from the constant conjunction of objects , and the consequent inference of one from the other . In a case where two propositions are diametrically opposite , the mind believes that which is least incomprehensible ;— it is easier to suppose that the universe has existed from all eternity than to conceive a being beyond its limits capable of creating it : if the mind sinks beneath the weight of one , is it an alleviation to increase the intolerability of the burthen ?</p>
   <p>The other argument , which is founded on a man 's knowledge of his own existence , stands thus . A man knows not only that he now is , but that once he was not ; consequently there must have been a cause . But our idea of causation is alone derivable from the constant conjunction of objects and the consequent inference of one from the other ; and , reasoning experimentally , we can only infer from effects causes exactly adequate to those effects . But there certainly is a generative power which is effected by certain instruments : we cannot prove that it is inherent in these instruments ; nor is the contrary hypothesis capable of demonstration : we admit that the generative power is incomprehensible ; but to suppose that the same effect is produced by an eternal , omniscient , omnipotent being leaves the cause in the same obscurity , but renders it more incomprehensible .</p>
   <p>3d , Testimony . It is required that testimony should not be contrary to reason . The testimony that the Deity convinces the senses of men of His existence can only be admitted by us if our mind considers it less probable that these men should have been deceived than that the Deity should have appeared to them . Our reason can never admit the testimony of men , who not only declare that they were eye-witnesses of miracles , but that the Deity was irrational ; for He commanded that He should be believed , He proposed the highest rewards for faith , eternal punishments for disbelief . We can only command voluntary actions ; belief is not an act of volition ; the mind is even passive , or involuntarily active ; from this it is evident that we have no sufficient testimony , or rather that testimony is insufficient to prove the being of a God . It has been before shown that it cannot be deduced from reason . They alone , then , who have been convinced by the evidence of the senses can believe it .</p>
   <p>Hence it is evident that , having no proofs from either of the three sources of conviction , the mind CANNOT believe the existence of a creative God : it is also evident that , as belief is a passion of the mind , no degree of criminality is attachable to disbelief ; and that they only are reprehensible who neglect to remove the false medium through which their mind views any subject of discussion . Every reflecting mind must acknowledge that there is no proof of the existence of a Deity .</p>
   <p>God is an hypothesis , and , as such , stands in need of proof : the onus probandi rests on the theist . Sir Isaac Newton says : Hypotheses non fingo , quicquid enim ex phaenomenis non deducitur hypothesis vocanda est , et hypothesis vel metaphysicae , vel physicae , vel qualitatum occultarum , seu mechanicae , in philosophia locum non habent . To all proofs of the existence of a creative God apply this valuable rule . We see a variety of bodies possessing a variety of powers : we merely know their effects ; we are in a state of ignorance with respect to their essences and causes . These Newton calls the phenomena of things ; but the pride of philosophy is unwilling to admit its ignorance of their causes . From the phenomena , which are the objects of our senses , we attempt to infer a cause , which we call God , and gratuitously endow it with all negative and contradictory qualities . From this hypothesis we invent this general name , to conceal our ignorance of causes and essences . The being called God by no means answers with the conditions prescribed by Newton ; it bears every mark of a veil woven by philosophical conceit , to hide the ignorance of philosophers even from themselves . They borrow the threads of its texture from the anthropomorphism of the vulgar . Words have been used by sophists for the same purposes , from the occult qualities of the peripatetics to the effluvium of Boyle and the crinities or nebulae of Herschel . God is represented as infinite , eternal , incomprehensible ; He is contained under every predicate in non that the logic of ignorance could fabricate . Even His worshippers allow that it is impossible to form any idea of Him : they exclaim with the French poet ,</p>
   <p>Pour dire ce qu'il est , il faut etre lui-meme .</p>
   <p>Lord Bacon says that atheism leaves to man reason , philosophy , natural piety , laws , reputation , and everything that can serve to conduct him to virtue ; but superstition destroys all these , and erects itself into a tyranny over the understandings of men : hence atheism never disturbs the government , but renders man more clear-sighted , since he seas nothing beyond the boundaries of the present life .— Bacon 's “ Moral Essays ” .</p>
   <p>La premiere theologie de l'homme lui fit d'abord craindre at adorer les elements meme , des objets materiels at grossiers ; il randit ensuite ses hommages a des agents presidant aux elements , a des genies inferieurs , a des heros , ou a des hommes doues de grandes qualites . A force de reflechir il crut simplifier les choses en soumettant la nature entiere a un seul agent , a un esprit , a una ame universelle , qui mettait cette nature et ses parties en mouvement . En remontant de causes en causes , les mortels ont fini par ne rien voir ; at c'est dans cette obscurite qu'ils ont place leur Dieu ; c'est dans cat abime tenebreux que leur imagination inquiete travaille toujours a se fabriquer des chimeres , qui les affligeront jusqu'a ce que la connaissance da la nature les detrompe des fantomes qu'ils ont toujours si vainement adores .</p>
   <p>Si nous voulons nous rendre compte de nos idees sur la Divinite , nous serons obliges de convanir que , par le mot “ Dieu ” , les hommes n'ont jamais pu designer que la cause la plus cachee , la plus eloignee , la plus inconnue des effets qu'ils voyaient : ils ne font usage de ce mot , que lorsque le jeu des causes naturelles at connues cesse d'etre visible pour eux ; des qu'ils perdent le fil de ces causes , on des que leur esprit ne peut plus en suivre la chaine , ils tranchent leur difficulte , at terminent leurs recherches en appellant Dieu la derniere des causes , c'esthYpppHeNahYpppHeNdire celle qui est au-dela de toutes les causes qu'ils connaissent ; ainsi ils ne font qu'assigner une denomination vague a une cause ignoree , a laquelle leur paresse ou les bornes de leurs connaissances les forcent de s'arreter . Toutes les fois qu'on nous dit que Dieu est l'auteur de quelque phenomene , cela signifie qu'on ignore comment un tel phenomene a pu s'operer par le secours des forces ou des causes que nous connaissons dans la nature . C'est ainsi que le commun des hommes , dont l'ignorance est la partage , attribue a la Divinite non seulement les effets inusites qui las frappent , mais encore les evenemens les plus simples , dont les causes sont les plus faciles a connaitre pour quiconque a pu les mediter . En un mot , l'homme a toujours respecte les causes inconnues des effets surprenans , que son ignorance l'empechait de demeler . Ce fut sur les debris de la nature que les hommes eleverent le colosse imaginaire de la Divinite .</p>
   <p>Si l'ignorance de la nature donna la naissance aux dieux , la connaissance de la nature est faite pour les detruire . A mesure que l'homme s'instruit , ses forces at ses ressources augmentent avec ses lumieres ; les sciences , les arts conservateurs , l'industrie , lui fournissent des secours ; l'experience le rassure ou lui procure des moyens de resister aux efforts de bien des causes qui cessent de l'alarmer des qu'il les a connues . En un mot , ses terreurs se dissipent dans la meme proportion que son esprit s'eclaire . L'homnme instruit cesse d'etre superstitieux .</p>
   <p>Ce n'est jamais que sur parole que des peuples entiers adorent le Dieu de leurs peres at de leurs pretres : l'autorite , la confiance , la soumission , et l'habitude leur tiennent lieu de conviction et de preuves ; ils se prosternent et prient , parce que leurs peres leur out appris a se prosterner at prier : mais pourquoi ceux-ci se sont-ils mis a genoux ? C'est que dans les temps eloignes leurs legislateurs et leurs guides leur en ont fait un devoir . ‘ Adorez at croyez , ’ ont-ils dit , ‘ des dieux que vous ne pouvez comprendre ; rapportez-vous-en a notre sagesse profonde ; nous en savons plus que vous sur la divinite . ’ Mais pourquoi m'en rapporteraishYpppHeNje a vous ? C'est que Dieu le veut ainsi , c'est que Dieu vous punira si vous osez resister . Mais ce Dieu n'esthYpppHeNil donc pas la chose en question ? Cependant las hommes se sont toujours payes de ce cercle vicieux ; la paresse de leur esprit leur fit trouver plus court de s'en rapporter au jugament des autres . Toutes las notions religieuses sent fondees uniquement sur l'autorite ; toutes les religions du monde defendent l'examen et ne veulent pas que l'on raisonne ; c'est l'autorite qui veut qu'on croie en Dieu ; ce Dieu n'est luihYpppHeNmeme fonde que sur l'autorite de quelques hommes qui pretendent le connaitre , et venir de sa part pour l'annoncer a la terre . Un Dieu fait par les hommes a sans doute bosom des hommes pour se faire connaitre aux hommes .</p>
   <p>Ne serait-ce donc que pour des pretres , des inspires , des metaphysiciens que serait reservee la conviction de l'existence d'un Dieu , que l'on dit neanmoins si necessaire a tout le genre humain ? Mais trouvons-nous de l'harmonie entre les opinions theologiques des differens inspires , ou des penseurs repandus sur la terre ? Ceux meme qui font profession d'adorer le meme Dieu , sent-ils d'accord sur son compte ? Sont-ils contents des preuves que leurs collegues apportent de son existence ? Souscrivent-ils unanimement aux idees qu'ils presentent sur sa nature , sur sa conduite , sur la facon d'entendre ses pretandus oracles ? Est-il une centree sur la terre ou la science de Dieu se soit reellement parfectionnee ? A-t-elle pris quelqne part la consistance et l'uniformite que nous voyons prendre aux connaissances humaines , aux arts les plus futiles , aux metiers les plus meprises ? Ces mots d'esprit , d'immaterialite , de creation , de predestination , de grace ; cette foule de distinctions subtiles dont la theologie s'est parteut remplie dans quelques pays , ces inventions si ingenieuses , imaginees par des penseurs qui se sont succedes depuis taut de siecles , n'ont fait , helas ! qu'embrouiller les choses , et jamais la science la plus necassaire aux hommes n'a jusqu'ici pu acquerir la moindre fixite . Depuis des milliers d'annees ces reveurs oisifs se sont perpetuellement relayes pour mediter la Divinite , pour deviner ses voies cachees , pour inventer des hypotheses propres a developper cette enigme importante . Leur peu de succes n'a point decourage la vanite theologique ; toujours on a parle de Dieu : on s'est egorge pour lui , et cet etre sublime demeure toujours le plus ignore et le plus discute .</p>
   <p>Les hommes auraient ete trop heureux , si , se bornant aux objets visibles qui les interessent , ils eussent employe a perfectionner leurs sciences reelles , leurs lois , leur morale , leur education , la moitie des efforts qu'ils ont mis dans leurs recherches sur la Divinite . Ils auraiant ete bien plus sages encore , et plus fortunes , s'ils eussent pu consentir a laisser leurs guides desoeuvres se quereller entre eux , et sonder des profondeurs capables de les etourdir , sans se meler de leurs disputes insensees . Mais il est de l'essence de l'ignorance d'attacher de l'importance a ce qu'elle ne comprend pas . La vanite humaine fait que l'esprit se roidit contra des difficultes . Plus un objet se derobe a nos yeux , plus nous faisons d'efforts pour le saisir , parce que des-lors il aiguillonne notre orgueil , il excite notre curiosite , il nous parait interessant . En combattant pour son Dieu chacun ne combattit en effet que pour les interets de sa propra vanite , qui de toutes les passions produites par la mal-organisation de la societe est la plus prompte a s'alarmer , et la plus propre a produire de tres grandes folies .</p>
   <p>Si ecartant pour un moment les idees facheuses que la theologie nous donne d'un Dieu capriciaux , dont les decrets partiaux et despotiques decident du sort des humains , nous ne voulons fixer nos yeux que sur la bonte pretendue , que tous les hommes , meme en tramblant devant ce Dieu , s'accordent a lui donner ; si nous lui supposons le projet qu'on lui prete de n'avoir travaille que pour sa propre gloire , d'exiger les hommages des etres intelligens ; de ne chercher dans ses oeuvres que le bien-etre du genre humain : comment concilier ces vues et ces dispositions avec l'ignorance vraiment invincible dans laquelle ce Dieu , si glorieux et si bon , laisse la plupart des hommes sur son compte ? Si Dieu veut etre connu , cheri , remercie , que ne se montre-t-il sous des traits favorables a tous ces etres intelligens dont il veut etre aime et adore ? Pourquoi ne point se manifester a toute la terre dune facon non equivoque , bien plus capable de nous convaincre que ces revelations particulieres qui semblent accuser la Divinite d'une partialite facheuse pour quelques-unes de ses creatures ? La tout-puissant n'auroithYpppHeNil donc pas des moyens plus convainquans de se montrer aux hommas que ces metamorphoses ridicules , cas incarnations pretendues , qui nous sont attestees par des ecrivains si peu d'accord entre eux dans les recits qu'ils en font ? Au lieu de tant de miracles , inventes pour prouver la mission divine de tant de legislateurs reveres par les differens peuples du monde , le souverain des esprits ne pouvait-il pas convaincre tout d'un coup l'esprit humain des choses qu'il a voulu lui faire connaitre ? Au lieu de suspendre un soleil dans la voute du firmament ; au lieu de repandre sans ordre les etoiles et les constellations qui remplissent l'espace , n'euthYpppHeNil pas ete plus conforme aux vues d'un Dieu si jaloux de sa gloire et si bien-intentionne pour l'homme d'ecrire , d'une facon non sujette a dispute , son nom , ses attributs , ses volontes permanentes en caracteres ineffacables , et lisibles egalement pour tous les habitants de la terre ? Personne alors n'aurait pu douter de l'existence d'un Dieu , de ses volontes claires , de ses intentions visibles . Sous les yeux de ce Dieu si terrible , personne n'aurait eu l'audace de violer ses ordonnances ; nul mortel n'eut ose se mettre dans le cas d'attirer sa colere : enfin nul homme n'eut eu le front d'en imposer en son nom , ou d'interpreter ses volontes suivant ses propres fantaisies .</p>
   <p>En effet , quand meme on admettrait l'existence du Dieu theologique et la realite des attributs si discordans qu'on lui donne , l'on n'en peut rien conclure , pour autoriser la conduite ou les cultes qu'on prescrit de lui rendre . La theologie est vraiment “ le tonneau des Danaides ” . A force de qualites contradictoires et d'assartions hasardees , ella a , pour ainsi dire , tellement garrotte son Dieu qu'elle l'a mis dans l'impossibilite d'agir . S'il est infiniment bon , quelle raison aurions-nous de le craindre ? S'il est infiniment sage , de quoi nous inquieter sur notre sort ? S'il sait tout , pourquoi l'avertir de nos besoins , et le fatiguer de nos prieres ? S'il est partout , pourquoi lui elever des temples ? S'il est maitre de tout , pourquoi lui faire des sacrifices et des offrandes ? S'il est juste , comment croire qu'il punisse des creatures qu'il a rempli de faiblesses ? Si la grace fait tout en elles , quelle raison aurait-il de les recompenser ? S'il est tout-puissant , comment l'offenser , comment lui resister ? S'il est raisonnable , comment se mattrait-il en colere contre des aveugles , a qui il a laisse la liberte de deraisonner ? S'il est immuable , de quel droit pretendrions-nous faire changer ses decrets ? S'il est inconcevable , pourquoi nous en occuper ? S'IL A PARLE , POURQUOI L'UNIVERS N'ESThYpppHeNIL PAS CONVAINCU ? Si la connaissance d'un Dieu est la plus necessaire , pourquoi n'esthYpppHeNelle pas la plus evidente et a plus claire ?— “ Systeme de la Nature ” , London , 1781 .</p>
   <p>The enlightened and benevolent Pliny thus publicly professes himself an atheist :— Quapropter effigiem Dei formamque quaerere imbecillitatis humanae reor . Quisquis est Deus ( si modo est alius ) et quacunque in parte , totus est sensus , totus est visus , totus auditus , totus animae , totus animi , totus sui ... Imperfectae vero in homine naturae praecipua solatia ne deum quidem posse omnia . Namque nec sibi potest mortem consciscere , si velit , quad homini dedit optimum in tantis vitae poenis : nec mortales aeternitata donare , aut revocare defunctos ; nec facere ut qui vixit non vixerit , qui honores gessit non gessarit , nullumque habere in praeteritum ius , praeterquam oblivionis , atque ( ut facetis quoque argumentis societas haec cum deo copuletur ) ut bis dena viginti non sint , et multa similiter efficere non posse .— Per quae declaratur haud dubie naturae potentiam id quoque esse quad Deum vocamus .— Plin . “ Nat . Hist . ” cap . de Deo .</p>
   <p>The consistent Newtonian is necessarily an atheist . See Sir W. Drummond 's “ Academical Questions ” , chapter 3 .— Sir W. seems to consider the atheism to which it leads as a sufficient presumption of the falsehood of the system of gravitation ; but surely it is more consistent with the good faith of philosophy to admit a deduction from facts than an hypothesis incapable of proof , although it might militate with the obstinate preconceptions of the mob . Had this author , instead of inveighing against the guilt and absurdity of atheism , demonstrated its falsehood , his conduct would have been more suited to the modesty of the sceptic and the toleration of the philosopher .</p>
   <p>Omnia enim per Dei potentiam facta sunt : imo quia naturae potentia nulla est nisi ipsa Dei potentia .

   <p>Ahasuerus , rise !</p>
   <p>‘ Ahasuerus the Jew crept forth from the dark cave of Mount Carmel . Near two thousand years have elapsed since he was first goaded by never-ending restlessness to rove the globe from pole to pole . When our Lord was wearied with the burthen of His ponderous cross , and wanted to rest before the door of Ahasuerus , the unfeeling wretch drove Him away with brutality . The Saviour of mankind staggered , sinking under the heavy load , but uttered no complaint . An angel of death appeared before Ahasuerus , and exclaimed indignantly , “ Barbarian ! thou hast denied rest to the Son of man : be it denied thee also , until He comes to judge the world . ”</p>
   <p>‘ A black demon , let loose from hell upon Ahasuerus , goads him now from country to country ; he is denied the consolation which death affords , and precluded from the rest of the peaceful grave .</p>
   <p>‘ Ahasuerus crept forth from the dark cave of Mount Carmel — he shook the dust from his beard — and taking up one of the skulls heaped there , hurled it down the eminence : it rebounded from the earth in shivered atoms . “ This was my father ! ” roared Ahasuerus . Seven more skulls rolled down from rock to rock ; while the infuriate Jew , following them with ghastly looks , exclaimed — “ And these were my wives ! ” He still continued to hurl down skull after skull , roaring in dreadful accents — “ And these , and these , and these were my children ! They COULD DIE ; but I ! reprobate wretch ! alas ! I cannot die ! Dreadful beyond conception is the judgement that hangs over me . Jerusalem fell — I crushed the sucking babe , and precipitated myself into the destructive flames . I cursed the Romans — but , alas ! alas ! the restless curse held me by the hair ,— and I could not die !</p>
   <p>‘ " Rome the giantess fell — I placed myself before the falling statue — she fell and did not crush me . Nations sprang up and disappeared before me ;— but I remained and did not die . From cloud-encircled cliffs did I precipitate myself into the ocean ; but the foaming billows cast me upon the shore , and the burning arrow of existence pierced my cold heart again . I leaped into Etna 's flaming abyss , and roared with the giants for ten long months , polluting with my groans the Mount 's sulphureous mouth — ah ! ten long months . The volcano fermented , and in a fiery stream of lava cast me up . I lay torn by the torture-snakes of hell amid the glowing cinders , and yet continued to exist .— A forest was on fire : I darted on wings of fury and despair into the crackling wood . Fire dropped upon me from the trees , but the flames only singed my limbs ; alas ! it could not consume them .— I now mixed with the butchers of mankind , and plunged in the tempest of the raging battle . I roared defiance to the infuriate Gaul , defiance to the victorious German ; but arrows and spears rebounded in shivers from my body . The Saracen 's flaming sword broke upon my skull : balls in vain hissed upon me : the lightnings of battle glared harmless around my loins : in vain did the elephant trample on me , in vain the iron hoof of the wrathful steed ! The mine , big with destructive power , burst upon me , and hurled me high in the air — I fell on heaps of smoking limbs , but was only singed . The giant 's steel club rebounded from my body ; the executioner 's hand could not strangle me , the tiger 's tooth could not pierce me , nor would the hungry lion in the circus devour me . I cohabited with poisonous snakes , and pinched the red crest of the dragon .— The serpent stung , but could not destroy me . The dragon tormented , but dared not to devour me .— I now provoked the fury of tyrants : I said to Nero , ‘ Thou art a bloodhound ! ’ I said to Christiern , ‘ Thou art a bloodhound !, I said to Muley Ismail , ‘ Thou art a bloodhound ! ’ — The tyrants invented cruel torments , but did not kill me . Ha ! not to be able to die — not to be able to die — not to be permitted to rest after the toils of life — to be doomed to be imprisoned for ever in the clay-formed dungeon — to be for ever clogged with this worthless body , its lead of diseases and infirmities — to be condemned to [ be ] hold for millenniums that yawning monster Sameness , and Time , that hungry hyaena , ever bearing children , and ever devouring again her offspring !— Ha ! not to be permitted to die ! Awful Avenger in Heaven , hast Thou in Thine armoury of wrath a punishment more dreadful ? then let it thunder upon me , command a hurricane to sweep me down to the foot of Carmel , that I there may lie extended ; may pant , and writhe , and die .!

   <p>A book is put into our hands when children , called the Bible , the purport of whose history is briefly this : That God made the earth in six days , and there planted a delightful garden , in which He placed the first pair of human beings . In the midst of the garden He planted a tree , whose fruit , although within their reach , they were forbidden to touch . That the Devil , in the shape of a snake , persuaded them to eat of this fruit ; in consequence of which God condemned both them and their posterity yet unborn to satisfy His justice by their eternal misery . That , four thousand years after these events ( the human race in the meanwhile having gone unredeemed to perdition ) , God engendered with the betrothed wife of a carpenter in Judea ( whose virginity was nevertheless uninjured ) , and begat a son , whose name was Jesus Christ ; and who was crucified and died , in order that no more men might be devoted to hell-fire , He bearing the burthen of His Father 's displeasure by proxy . The book states , in addition , that the soul of whoever disbelieves this sacrifice will be burned with everlasting fire .</p>
   <p>During many ages of misery and darkness this story gained implicit belief ; but at length men arose who suspected that it was a fable and imposture , and that Jesus Christ , so far from being a God , was only a man like themselves . But a numerous set of men , who derived and still derive immense emoluments from this opinion , in the shape of a popular belief , told the vulgar that if they did not believe in the Bible they would be damned to all eternity ; and burned , imprisoned , and poisoned all the unbiassed and unconnected inquirers who occasionally arose . They still oppress them , so far as the people , now become more enlightened , will allow .</p>
   <p>The belief in all that the Bible contains is called Christianity . A Roman governor of Judea , at the instance of a priest-led mob , crucified a man called Jesus eighteen centuries ago . He was a man of pure life , who desired to rescue his countrymen from the tyranny of their barbarous and degrading superstitions . The common fate of all who desire to benefit mankind awaited him . The rabble , at the instigation of the priests , demanded his death , although his very judge made public acknowledgement of his innocence . Jesus was sacrificed to the honour of that God with whom he was afterwards confounded . It is of importance , therefore , to distinguish between the pretended character of this being as the Son of God and the Saviour of the world , and his real character as a man , who , for a vain attempt to reform the world , paid the forfeit of his life to that overbearing tyranny which has since so long desolated the universe in his name . Whilst the one is a hypocritical Daemon , who announces Himself as the God of compassion and peace , even whilst He stretches forth His blood-red hand with the sword of discord to waste the earth , having confessedly devised this scheme of desolation from eternity ; the other stands in the foremost list of those true heroes who have died in the glorious martyrdom of liberty , and have braved torture , contempt , and poverty in the cause of suffering humanity . ( Since writing this note I have some reason to suspect that Jesus was an ambitious man , who aspired to the throne of Judea .</p>
   <p>The vulgar , ever in extremes , became persuaded that the crucifixion of Jesus was a supernatural event . Testimonies of miracles , so frequent in unenlightened ages , were not wanting to prove that he was something divine . This belief , rolling through the lapse of ages , met with the reveries of Plato and the reasonings of Aristotle , and acquired force and extent , until the divinity of Jesus became a dogma , which to dispute was death , which to doubt was infamy .</p>
   <p>CHRISTIANITY is now the established religion : he who attempts to impugn it must be contented to behold murderers and traitors take precedence of him in public opinion ; though , if his genius be equal to his courage , and assisted by a peculiar coalition of circumstances , future ages may exalt him to a divinity , and persecute others in his name , as he was persecuted in the name of his predecessor in the homage of the world .</p>
   <p>The same means that have supported every other popular belief have supported Christianity . War , imprisonment , assassination , and falsehood ; deeds of unexampled and incomparable atrocity have made it what it is . The blood shed by the votaries of the God of mercy and peace , since the establishment of His religion , would probably suffice to drown all other sectaries now on the habitable globe . We derive from our ancestors a faith thus fostered and supported : we quarrel , persecute , and hate for its maintenance . Even under a government which , whilst it infringes the very right of thought and speech , boasts of permitting the liberty of the press , a man is pilloried and imprisoned because he is a deist , and no one raises his voice in the indignation of outraged humanity . But it is ever a proof that the falsehood of a proposition is felt by those who use coercion , not reasoning , to procure its admission ; and a dispassionate observer would feel himself more powerfully interested in favour of a man who , depending on the truth of his opinions , simply stated his reasons for entertaining them , than in that of his aggressor who , daringly avowing his unwillingness or incapacity to answer them by argument , proceeded to repress the energies and break the spirit of their promulgator by that torture and imprisonment whose infliction he could command .</p>
   <p>Analogy seems to favour the opinion that as , like other systems , Christianity has arisen and augmented , so like them it will decay and perish ; that as violence , darkness , and deceit , not reasoning and persuasion , have procured its admission among mankind , so , when enthusiasm has subsided , and time , that infallible controverter of false opinions , has involved its pretended evidences in the darkness of antiquity , it will become obsolete ; that Milton 's poem alone will give permanency to the remembrance of its absurdities ; and that men will laugh as heartily at grace , faith , redemption , and original sin , as they now do at the metamorphoses of Jupiter , the miracles of Romish saints , the efficacy of witchcraft , and the appearance of departed spirits .</p>
   <p>Had the Christian religion commenced and continued by the mere force of reasoning and persuasion , the preceding analogy would be inadmissible . We should never speculate on the future obsoleteness of a system perfectly conformable to nature and reason : it would endure so long as they endured ; it would be a truth as indisputable as the light of the sun , the criminality of murder , and other facts , whose evidence , depending on our organization and relative situations , must remain acknowledged as satisfactory so long as man is man . It is an incontrovertible fact , the consideration of which ought to repress the hasty conclusions of credulity , or moderate its obstinacy in maintaining them , that , had the Jews not been a fanatical race of men , had even the resolution of Pontius Pilate been equal to his candour , the Christian religion never could have prevailed , it could not even have existed : on so feeble a thread hangs the most cherished opinion of a sixth of the human race ! When will the vulgar learn humility ? When will the pride of ignorance blush at having believed before it could comprehend ?</p>
   <p>Either the Christian religion is true , or it is false : if true , it comes from God , and its authenticity can admit of doubt and dispute no further than its omnipotent author is willing to allow . Either the power or the goodness of God is called in question , if He leaves those doctrines most essential to the well-being of man in doubt and dispute ; the only ones which , since their promulgation , have been the subject of unceasing cavil , the cause of irreconcilable hatred . IF GOD HAS SPOKEN , WHY IS THE UNIVERSE NOT CONVINCED ?</p>
   <p>There is this passage in the Christian Scriptures : ‘ Those who obey not God , and believe not the Gospel of his Son , shall be punished with everlasting destruction . ’ This is the pivot upon which all religions turn :— they all assume that it is in our power to believe or not to believe ; whereas the mind can only believe that which it thinks true . A human being can only be supposed accountable for those actions which are influenced by his will . But belief is utterly distinct from and unconnected with volition : it is the apprehension of the agreement or disagreement of the ideas that compose any preposition . Belief is a passion , or involuntary operation of the mind , and , like other passions , its intensity is precisely proportionate to the degrees of excitement . Volition is essential to merit or demerit . But the Christian religion attaches the highest possible degrees of merit and demerit to that which is worthy of neither , and which is totally unconnected with the peculiar faculty of the mind , whose presence is essential to their being .</p>
   <p>Christianity was intended to reform the world : had an all-wise Being planned it , nothing is more improbable than that it should have failed : omniscience would infallibly have foreseen the inutility of a scheme which experience demonstrates , to this age , to have been utterly unsuccessful .</p>
   <p>Christianity inculcates the necessity of supplicating the Deity . Prayer may be considered under two points of view ;— as an endeavour to change the intentions of God , or as a formal testimony of our obedience . But the former case supposes that the caprices of a limited intelligence can occasionally instruct the Creator of the world how to regulate the universe ; and the latter , a certain degree of servility analogous to the loyalty demanded by earthly tyrants . Obedience indeed is only the pitiful and cowardly egotism of him who thinks that he can do something better than reason .</p>
   <p>Christianity , like all other religions , rests upon miracles , prophecies , and martyrdoms . No religion ever existed which had not its prophets , its attested miracles , and , above all , crowds of devotees who would bear patiently the most horrible tortures to prove its authenticity . It should appear that in no case can a discriminating mind subscribe to the genuineness of a miracle . A miracle is an infraction of nature 's law , by a supernatural cause ; by a cause acting beyond that eternal circle within which all things are included . God breaks through the law of nature , that He may convince mankind of the truth of that revelation which , in spite of His precautions , has been , since its introduction , the subject of unceasing schism and cavil .</p>
   <p>Miracles resolve themselves into the following question ( See Hume 's Essay , volume 2 page 121 . ):— Whether it is more probable the laws of nature , hitherto so immutably harmonious , should have undergone violation , or that a man should have told a lie ? Whether it is more probable that we are ignorant of the natural cause of an event , or that we know the supernatural one ? That , in old times , when the powers of nature were less known than at present , a certain set of men were themselves deceived , or had some hidden motive for deceiving others ; or that God begat a Son , who , in His legislation , measuring merit by belief , evidenced Himself to be totally ignorant of the powers of the human mind — of what is voluntary , and what is the contrary ?</p>
   <p>We have many instances of men telling lies ;— none of an infraction of nature 's laws , those laws of whose government alone we have any knowledge or experience . The records of all nations afford innumerable instances of men deceiving others either from vanity or interest , or themselves being deceived by the limitedness of their views and their ignorance of natural causes : but where is the accredited case of God having come upon earth , to give the lie to His own creations ? There would be something truly wonderful in the appearance of a ghost ; but the assertion of a child that he saw one as he passed through the churchyard is universally admitted to be less miraculous .</p>
   <p>But even supposing that a man should raise a dead body to life before our eyes , and on this fact rest his claim to being considered the son of God ;— the Humane Society restores drowned persons , and because it makes no mystery of the method it employs , its members are not mistaken for the sons of God . All that we have a right to infer from our ignorance of the cause of any event is that we do not know it : had the Mexicans attended to this simple rule when they heard the cannon of the Spaniards , they would not have considered them as gods : the experiments of modern chemistry would have defied the wisest philosophers of ancient Greece and Rome to have accounted for them on natural principles . An author of strong common sense has observed that ‘ a miracle is no miracle at second-hand ’ ; he might have added that a miracle is no miracle in any case ; for until we are acquainted with all natural causes , we have no reason to imagine others .</p>
   <p>There remains to be considered another proof of Christianity — Prophecy . A book is written before a certain event , in which this event is foretold ; how could the prophet have foreknown it without inspiration ? how could he have been inspired without God ? The greatest stress is laid on the prophecies of Moses and Hosea on the dispersion of the Jews , and that of Isaiah concerning the coming of the Messiah . The prophecy of Moses is a collection of every possible cursing and blessing ; and it is so far from being marvellous that the one of dispersion should have been fulfilled , that it would have been more surprising if , out of all these , none should have taken effect . In Deuteronomy , chapter 28 , verse 64 , where Moses explicitly foretells the dispersion , he states that they shall there serve gods of wood and stone : ‘ And the Lord shall scatter thee among all people , from the one end of the earth even to the other ; AND THERE THOU SHALT SERVE OTHER GODS , WHICH NEITHER THOU NOR THY FATHERS HAVE KNOWN , EVEN GODS OF WOOD AND STONE . ’ The Jews are at this day remarkably tenacious of their religion . Moses also declares that they shall be subjected to these curses for disobedience to his ritual : ‘ And it shall come to pass , if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God , to observe to do all the commandments and statutes which I command thee this day ; that all these curses shall come upon thee , and overtake thee . ’ Is this the real reason ? The third , fourth , and fifth chapters of Hosea are a piece of immodest confession . The indelicate type might apply in a hundred senses to a hundred things . The fifty-third chapter of Isaiah is more explicit , yet it does not exceed in clearness the oracles of Delphos . The historical proof that Moses , Isaiah , and Hosea did write when they are said to have written is far from being clear and circumstantial .</p>
   <p>But prophecy requires proof in its character as a miracle ; we have no right to suppose that a man foreknew future events from God , until it is demonstrated that he neither could know them by his own exertions , nor that the writings which contain the prediction could possibly have been fabricated after the event pretended to be foretold . It is more probable that writings , pretending to divine inspiration , should have been fabricated after the fulfilment of their pretended prediction than that they should have really been divinely inspired , when we consider that the latter supposition makes God at once the creator of the human mind and ignorant of its primary powers , particularly as we have numberless instances of false religions , and forged prophecies of things long past , and no accredited case of God having conversed with men directly or indirectly . It is also possible that the description of an event might have foregone its occurrence ; but this is far from being a legitimate proof of a divine revelation , as many men , not pretending to the character of a prophet , have nevertheless , in this sense , prophesied .</p>
   <p>Lord Chesterfield was never yet taken for a prophet , even by a bishop , yet he uttered this remarkable prediction : ‘ The despotic government of France is screwed up to the highest pitch ; a revolution is fast approaching ; that revolution , I am convinced , will be radical and sanguinary . ’ This appeared in the letters of the prophet long before the accomplishment of this wonderful prediction . Now , have these particulars come to pass , or have they not ? If they have , how could the Earl have foreknown them without inspiration ? If we admit the truth of the Christian religion on testimony such as this , we must admit , on the same strength of evidence , that God has affixed the highest rewards to belief , and the eternal tortures of the never-dying worm to disbelief , both of which have been demonstrated to be involuntary .</p>
   <p>The last proof of the Christian religion depends on the influence of the Holy Ghost . Theologians divide the influence of the Holy Ghost into its ordinary and extraordinary modes of operation . The latter is supposed to be that which inspired the Prophets and Apostles ; and the former to be the grace of God , which summarily makes known the truth of His revelation to those whose mind is fitted for its reception by a submissive perusal of His word . Persons convinced in this manner can do anything but account for their conviction , describe the time at which it happened , or the manner in which it came upon them . It is supposed to enter the mind by other channels than those of the senses , and therefore professes to be superior to reason founded on their experience .</p>
   <p>Admitting , however , the usefulness or possibility of a divine revelation , unless we demolish the foundations of all human knowledge , it is requisite that our reason should previously demonstrate its genuineness ; for , before we extinguish the steady ray of reason and common sense , it is fit that we should discover whether we cannot do without their assistance , whether or no there be any other which may suffice to guide us through the labyrinth of life ( See Locke 's “ Essay on the Human Understanding ” , book 4 chapter 19 , on Enthusiasm . ): for , if a man is to be inspired upon all occasions , if he is to be sure of a thing because he is sure , if the ordinary operations of the Spirit are not to be considered very extraordinary modes of demonstration , if enthusiasm is to usurp the place of proof , and madness that of sanity , all reasoning is superfluous . The Mahometan dies fighting for his prophet , the Indian immolates himself at the chariot-wheels of Brahma , the Hottentot worships an insect , the Negro a bunch of feathers , the Mexican sacrifices human victims ! Their degree of conviction must certainly be very strong : it cannot arise from reasoning , it must from feelings , the reward of their prayers . If each of these should affirm , in opposition to the strongest possible arguments , that inspiration carried internal evidence , I fear their inspired brethren , the orthodox missionaries , would be so uncharitable as to pronounce them obstinate .</p>
   <p>Miracles cannot be received as testimonies of a disputed fact , because all human testimony has ever been insufficient to establish the possibility of miracles . That which is incapable of proof itself is no proof of anything else . Prophecy has also been rejected by the test of reason . Those , then , who have been actually inspired are the only true believers in the Christian religion .</p>

   <p>Time is our consciousness of the succession of ideas in our mind . Vivid sensation , of either pain or pleasure , makes the time seem long , as the common phrase is , because it renders us more acutely conscious of our ideas . If a mind be conscious of an hundred ideas during one minute , by the clock , and of two hundred during another , the latter of these spaces would actually occupy so much greater extent in the mind as two exceed one in quantity . If , therefore , the human mind , by any future improvement of its sensibility , should become conscious of an infinite number of ideas in a minute , that minute would be eternity . I do not hence infer that the actual space between the birth and death of a man will ever be prolonged ; but that his sensibility is perfectible , and that the number of ideas which his mind is capable of receiving is indefinite . One man is stretched on the rack during twelve hours ; another sleeps soundly in his bed : the difference of time perceived by these two persons is immense ; one hardly will believe that half an hour has elapsed , the other could credit that centuries had flown during his agony . Thus , the life of a man of virtue and talent , who should die in his thirtieth year , is , with regard to his own feelings , longer than that of a miserable priest-ridden slave , who dreams out a century of dulness . The one has perpetually cultivated his mental faculties , has rendered himself master of his thoughts , can abstract and generalize amid the lethargy of every-day business ;— the other can slumber over the brightest moments of his being , and is unable to remember the happiest hour of his life . Perhaps the perishing ephemeron enjoys a longer life than the tortoise .</p>

   <p>I hold that the depravity of the physical and moral nature of man originated in his unnatural habits of life . The origin of man , like that of the universe of which he is a part , is enveloped in impenetrable mystery . His generations either had a beginning , or they had not . The weight of evidence in favour of each of these suppositions seems tolerably equal ; and it is perfectly unimportant to the present argument which is assumed . The language spoken , however , by the mythology of nearly all religions seems to prove that at some distant period man forsook the path of nature , and sacrificed the purity and happiness of his being to unnatural appetites . The date of this event seems to have also been that of some great change in the climates of the earth , with which it has an obvious correspondence . The allegory of Adam and Eve eating of the tree of evil , and entailing upon their posterity the wrath of God and the loss of everlasting life , admits of no other explanation than the disease and crime that have flowed from unnatural diet . Milton was so well aware of this that he makes Raphael thus exhibit to Adam the consequence of his disobedience :—</p>

   <p>The story of Prometheus is one likewise which , although universally admitted to be allegorical , has never been satisfactorily explained . Prometheus stole fire from heaven , and was chained for this crime to Mount Caucasus , where a vulture continually devoured his liver , that grew to meet its hunger . Hesiod says that , before the time of Prometheus , mankind were exempt from suffering ; that they enjoyed a vigorous youth , and that death , when at length it came , approached like sleep , and gently closed their eyes . Again , so general was this opinion that Horace , a poet of the Augustan age , writes :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Audax omnia perpeti ,</l>
     <l n="2">Gens humana ruit per vetitum nefas ;</l>

   <p>How plain a language is spoken by all this ! Prometheus ( who represents the human race ) effected some great change in the condition of his nature , and applied fire to culinary purposes ; thus inventing an expedient for screening from his disgust the horrors of the shambles . From this moment his vitals were devoured by the vulture of disease . It consumed his being in every shape of its loathsome and infinite variety , inducing the soul-quelling sinkings of premature and violent death . All vice rose from the ruin of healthful innocence . Tyranny , superstition , commerce , and inequality were then first known , when reason vainly attempted to guide the wanderings of exacerbated passion . I conclude this part of the subject with an extract from Mr. Newton 's “ Defence of Vegetable Regimen ” , from whom I have borrowed this interpretation of the fable of Prometheus .</p>
   <p>‘ Making allowance for such transposition of the events of the allegory as time might produce after the important truths were forgotten , which this portion of the ancient mythology was intended to transmit , the drift of the fable seems to be this :— Man at his creation was endowed with the gift of perpetual youth ; that is , he was not formed to be a sickly suffering creature as we now see him , but to enjoy health , and to sink by slow degrees into the bosom of his parent earth without disease or pain . Prometheus first taught the use of animal food ( primus bovem occidit Prometheus ( Plin . “ Nat .

Jupiter , and the rest of the gods , foreseeing the consequences of these inventions , were amused or irritated at the short-sighted devices of the newly-formed creature , and left him to experience the sad effects of them . Thirst , the necessary concomitant of a flesh diet ’ ( perhaps of all diet vitiated by culinary preparation ) , ‘ ensued ; water was resorted to , and man forfeited the inestimable gift of health which he had received from heaven : he became diseased , the partaker of a precarious existence , and no longer descended slowly to his grave .

   <p>Man , and the animals whom he has infected with his society , or depraved by his dominion , are alone diseased . The wild hog , the mouflon , the bison , and the wolf ; are perfectly exempt from malady , and invariably die either from external violence or natural old age . But the domestic hog , the sheep , the cow , and the dog , are subject to an incredible variety of distempers ; and , like the corruptors of their nature , have physicians who thrive upon their miseries . The supereminence of man is like Satan 's , a supereminence of pain ; and the majority of his species , doomed to penury , disease , and crime , have reason to curse the untoward event that , by enabling him to communicate his sensations , raised him above the level of his fellow-animals . But the steps that have been taken are irrevocable . The whole of human science is comprised in one question :— How can the advantages of intellect and civilization be reconciled with the liberty and pure pleasures of natural life ? How can we take the benefits and reject the evils of the system , which is now interwoven with all the fibres of our being ?— I believe that abstinence from animal food and spirituous liquors would in a great measure capacitate us for the solution of this important question .</p>
   <p>It is true that mental and bodily derangement is attributable in part to other deviations from rectitude and nature than those which concern diet . The mistakes cherished by society respecting the connection of the sexes , whence the misery and diseases of unsatisfied celibacy , unenjoying prostitution , and the premature arrival of puberty , necessarily spring ; the putrid atmosphere of crowded cities ; the exhalations of chemical processes ; the muffling of our bodies in superfluous apparel ; the absurd treatment of infants :— all these and innumerable other causes contribute their mite to the mass of human evil .</p>
   <p>Comparative anatomy teaches us that man resembles frugivorous animals in everything , and carnivorous in nothing ; he has neither claws wherewith to seize his prey , nor distinct and pointed teeth to tear the living fibre . A Mandarin of the first class , with nails two inches long , would probably find them alone inefficient to hold even a hare . After every subterfuge of gluttony , the bull must be degraded into the ox , and the ram into the wether , by an unnatural and inhuman operation , that the flaccid fibre may offer a fainter resistance to rebellious nature . It is only by softening and disguising dead flesh by culinary preparation that it is rendered susceptible of mastication or digestion ; and that the sight of its bloody juices and raw horror does not excite intolerable loathing and disgust . Let the advocate of animal food force himself to a decisive experiment on its fitness , and , as Plutarch recommends , tear a living lamb with his teeth , and plunging his head into its vitals slake his thirst with the steaming blood ; when fresh from the deed of horror , let him revert to the irresistible instincts of nature that would rise in judgement against it , and say , ‘ Nature formed me for such work as this . ’ Then , and then only , would he be consistent .</p>
   <p>Man resembles no carnivorous animal . There is no exception , unless man be one , to the rule of herbivorous animals having cellulated colons .</p>
   <p>The orang-outang perfectly resembles man both in the order and number of his teeth . The orang-outang is the most anthropomorphous of the ape tribe , all of which are strictly frugivorous . There is no other species of animals , which live on different food , in which this analogy exists . ( Cuvier , “ Lecons d'Anat . Comp ” . tom . 3 , pages 169 , 373 , 448 , 465 , 480 . Rees 's “ Cyclopaedia ” , article Man . ) In many frugivorous animals , the canine teeth are more pointed and distinct than those of man . The resemblance also of the human stomach to that of the orang-outang is greater than to that of any other animal .</p>
   <p>The intestines are also identical with those of herbivorous animals , which present a larger surface for absorption and have ample and cellulated colons . The caecum also , though short , is larger than that of carnivorous animals ; and even here the orang-outang retains its accustomed similarity .</p>
   <p>The structure of the human frame , then , is that of one fitted to a pure vegetable diet , in every essential particular . It is true that the reluctance to abstain from animal food , in those who have been long accustomed to its stimulus , is so great in some persons of weak minds as to be scarcely overcome ; but this is far from bringing any argument in its favour . A lamb , which was fed for some time on flesh by a ship 's crew , refused its natural diet at the end of the voyage . There are numerous instances of horses , sheep , oxen , and even wood-pigeons , having been taught to live upon flesh , until they have loathed their natural aliment . Young children evidently prefer pastry , oranges , apples , and other fruit , to the flesh of animals ; until , by the gradual depravation of the digestive organs , the free use of vegetables has for a time produced serious inconveniences ; FOR A TIME , I say , since there never was an instance wherein a change from spirituous liquors and animal food to vegetables and pure water has failed ultimately to invigorate the body , by rendering its juices bland and consentaneous , and to restore to the mind that cheerfulness and elasticity which not one in fifty possesses on the present system . A love of strong liquors is also with difficulty taught to infants . Almost every one remembers the wry faces which the first glass of port produced . Unsophisticated instinct is invariably unerring ; but to decide on the fitness of animal food from the perverted appetites which its constrained adoption produces ; is to make the criminal a judge in his own cause : it is even worse , it is appealing to the infatuated drunkard in a question of the salubrity of brandy .</p>
   <p>What is the cause of morbid action in the animal system ? Not the air we breathe , for our fellow-denizens of nature breathe the same uninjured ; not the water we drink ( if remote from the pollutions of man and his inventions ( The necessity of resorting to some means of purifying water , and the disease which arises from its adulteration in civilized countries , is sufficiently apparent . See Dr. Lambe 's “ Reports on Cancer ” . I do not assert that the use of water is in itself unnatural , but that the unperverted palate would swallow no liquid capable of occasioning disease . )) , for the animals drink it too ; not the earth we tread upon ; not the unobscured sight of glorious nature , in the wood , the field , or the expanse of sky and ocean ; nothing that we are or do in common with the undiseased inhabitants of the forest . Something , then , wherein we differ from them : our habit of altering our food by fire , so that our appetite is no longer a just criterion for the fitness of its gratification . Except in children , there remain no traces of that instinct which determines , in all other animals , what aliment is natural or otherwise ; and so perfectly obliterated are they in the reasoning adults of our species , that it has become necessary to urge considerations drawn from comparative anatomy to prove that we are naturally frugivorous .</p>
   <p>Crime is madness . Madness is disease . Whenever the cause of disease shall be discovered , the root , from which all vice and misery have so long overshadowed the globe , will lie bare to the axe . All the exertions of man , from that moment , may be considered as tending to the clear profit of his species . No sane mind in a sane body resolves upon a real crime . It is a man of violent passions , bloodshot eyes , and swollen veins , that alone can grasp the knife of murder . The system of a simple diet promises no Utopian advantages . It is no mere reform of legislation , whilst the furious passions and evil propensities of the human heart , in which it had its origin , are still unassuaged . It strikes at the root of all evil , and is an experiment which may be tried with success , not alone by nations , but by small societies , families , and even individuals . In no cases has a return to vegetable diet produced the slightest injury ; in most it has been attended with changes undeniably beneficial . Should ever a physician be born with the genius of Locke , I am persuaded that he might trace all bodily and mental derangements to our unnatural habits , as clearly as that philosopher has traced all knowledge to sensation . What prolific sources of disease are not those mineral and vegetable poisons that have been introduced for its extirpation ! How many thousands have become murderers and robbers , bigots and domestic tyrants , dissolute and abandoned adventurers , from the use of fermented liquors ; who , had they slaked their thirst only with pure water , would have lived but to diffuse the happiness of their own unperverted feelings ! How many groundless opinions and absurd institutions have not received a general sanction from the sottishness and intemperance of individuals ! Who will assert that , had the populace of Paris satisfied their hunger at the ever-furnished table of vegetable nature , they would have lent their brutal suffrage to the proscription-list of Robespierre ? Could a set of men , whose passions were not perverted by unnatural stimuli , look with coolness on an auto da fe ? Is it to be believed that a being of gentle feelings , rising from his meal of roots , would take delight in sports of blood ? Was Nero a man of temperate life ? could you read calm health in his cheek , flushed with ungovernable propensities of hatred for the human race ? Did Muley Ismael 's pulse beat evenly , was his skin transparent , did his eyes beam with healthfulness , and its invariable concomitants , cheerfulness and benignity ? Though history has decided none of these questions , a child could not hesitate to answer in the negative . Surely the bile-suffused cheek of Buonaparte , his wrinkled brow , and yellow eye , the ceaseless inquietude of his nervous system , speak no less plainly the character of his unresting ambition than his murders and his victories . It is impossible , had Buonaparte descended from a race of vegetable feeders , that he could have had either the inclination or the power to ascend the throne of the Bourbons . The desire of tyranny could scarcely be excited in the individual , the power to tyrannize would certainly not be delegated by a society neither frenzied by inebriation nor rendered impotent and irrational by disease . Pregnant indeed with inexhaustible calamity is the renunciation of instinct , as it concerns our physical nature ; arithmetic cannot enumerate , nor reason perhaps suspect , the multitudinous sources of disease in civilized life . Even common water , that apparently innoxious pabulum , when corrupted by the filth of populous cities , is a deadly and insidious destroyer . ( Lambe 's “ Reports on Cancer ” . ) Who can wonder that all the inducements held out by God Himself in the Bible to virtue should have been vainer than a nurse 's tale ; and that those dogmas , by which He has there excited and justified the most ferocious propensities , should have alone been deemed essential ; whilst Christians are in the daily practice of all those habits which have infected with disease and crime , not only the reprobate sons , but those favoured children of the common Father 's love ? Omnipotence itself could not save them from the consequences of this original and universal sin .</p>
   <p>There is no disease , bodily or mental , which adoption of vegetable diet and pure water has not infallibly mitigated , wherever the experiment has been fairly tried . Debility is gradually converted into strength ; disease into healthfulness ; madness , in all its hideous variety , from the ravings of the fettered maniac to the unaccountable irrationalities of ill-temper , that make a hell of domestic life , into a calm and considerate evenness of temper , that alone might offer a certain pledge of the future moral reformation of society . On a natural system of diet , old age would be our last and our only malady ; the term of our existence would be protracted ; we should enjoy life , and no longer preclude others from the enjoyment of it ; all sensational delights would be infinitely more exquisite and perfect ; the very sense of being would then be a continued pleasure , such as we now feel it in some few and favoured moments of our youth . By all that is sacred in our hopes for the human race , I conjure those who love happiness and truth to give a fair trial to the vegetable system . Reasoning is surely superfluous on a subject whose merits an experience of six months would set for ever at rest . But it is only among the enlightened and benevolent that so great a sacrifice of appetite and prejudice can be expected , even though its ultimate excellence should not admit of dispute . It is found easier , by the short-sighted victims of disease , to palliate their torments by medicine than to prevent them by regimen . The vulgar of all ranks are invariably sensual and indocile ; yet I cannot but feel myself persuaded that when the benefits of vegetable diet are mathematically proved , when it is as clear that those who live naturally are exempt from premature death as that nine is not one , the most sottish of mankind will feel a preference towards a long and tranquil , contrasted with a short and painful , life . On the average , out of sixty persons four die in three years . Hopes are entertained that , in April , 1814 , a statement will be given that sixty persons , all having lived more than three years on vegetables and pure water , are then IN PERFECT HEALTH . More than two years have now elapsed ; NOT ONE OF THEM HAS DIED ; no such example will be found in any sixty persons taken at random . Seventeen persons of all ages ( the families of Dr. Lambe and Mr. Newton ) have lived for seven years on this diet without a death , and almost without the slightest illness . Surely , when we consider that some of those were infants , and one a martyr to asthma now nearly subdued , we may challenge any seventeen persons taken at random in this city to exhibit a parallel case . Those who may have been excited to question the rectitude of established habits of diet by these loose remarks , should consult Mr. Newton 's luminous and eloquent essay . ( “ Return to Nature , or Defence of Vegetable Regimen ” . Cadell , 1811 . )</p>
   <p>When these proofs come fairly before the world , and are clearly seen by all who understand arithmetic , it is scarcely possible that abstinence from aliments demonstrably pernicious should not become universal . In proportion to the number of proselytes , so will be the weight of evidence ; and when a thousand persons can be produced , living on vegetables and distilled water , who have to dread no disease but old age , the world will be compelled to regard animal flesh and fermented liquors as slow but certain poisons . The change which would be produced by simpler habits on political economy is sufficiently remarkable . The monopolizing eater of animal flesh would no longer destroy his constitution by devouring an acre at a meal , and many loaves of bread would cease to contribute to gout , madness and apoplexy , in the shape of a pint of porter , or a dram of gin , when appeasing the long-protracted famine of the hardworking peasant 's hungry babes . The quantity of nutritious vegetable matter , consumed in fattening the carcase of an ox , would afford ten times the sustenance , undepraving indeed , and incapable of generating disease , if gathered immediately from the bosom of the earth . The most fertile districts of the habitable globe are now actually cultivated by men for animals , at a delay and waste of aliment absolutely incapable of calculation . It is only the wealthy that can , to any great degree , even now , indulge the unnatural craving for dead flesh , and they pay for the greater licence of the privilege by subjection to supernumerary diseases . Again , the spirit of the nation that should take the lead in this great reform would insensibly become agricultural ; commerce , with all its vice , selfishness , and corruption , would gradually decline ; more natural habits would produce gentler manners , and the excessive complication of political relations would be so far simplified that every individual might feel and understand why he loved his country , and took a personal interest in its welfare . How would England , for example , depend on the caprices of foreign rulers if she contained within herself all the necessaries , and despised whatever they possessed of the luxuries , of life ? How could they starve her into compliance with their views ? Of what consequence would it be that they refused to take her woollen manufactures , when large and fertile tracts of the island ceased to be allotted to the waste of pasturage ? On a natural system of diet we should require no spices from India ; no wines from Portugal , Spain , France , or Madeira ; none of those multitudinous articles of luxury , for which every corner of the globe is rifled , and which are the causes of so much individual rivalship , such calamitous and sanguinary national disputes . In the history of modern times , the avarice of commercial monopoly , no less than the ambition of weak and wicked chiefs , seems to have fomented the universal discord , to have added stubbornness to the mistakes of cabinets , and indocility to the infatuation of the people . Let it ever be remembered that it is the direct influence of commerce to make the interval between the richest and the poorest man wider and more unconquerable . Let it be remembered that it is a foe to everything of real worth and excellence in the human character . The odious and disgusting aristocracy of wealth is built upon the ruins of all that is good in chivalry or republicanism ; and luxury is the forerunner of a barbarism scarce capable of cure . Is it impossible to realize a state of society , where all the energies of man shall be directed to the production of his solid happiness ? Certainly , if this advantage ( the object of all political speculation ) be in any degree attainable , it is attainable only by a community which holds out no factitious incentives to the avarice and ambition of the few , and which is internally organized for the liberty , security , and comfort of the many . None must be entrusted with power ( and money is the completest species of power ) who do not stand pledged to use it exclusively for the general benefit . But the use of animal flesh and fermented liquors directly militates with this equality of the rights of man . The peasant cannot gratify these fashionable cravings without leaving his family to starve . Without disease and war , those sweeping curtailers of population , pasturage would include a waste too great to be afforded . The labour requisite to support a family is far lighter ’ than is usually supposed . ( It has come under the author 's experience that some of the workmen on an embankment in North Wales , who , in consequence of the inability of the proprietor to pay them , seldom received their wages , have supported large families by cultivating small spots of sterile ground by moonlight . In the notes to Pratt 's poem , “ Bread , or the Poor ” , is an account of an industrious labourer who , by working in a small garden , before and after his day 's task , attained to an enviable state of independence . ) The peasantry work , not only for themselves , but for the aristocracy , the army , and the manufacturers .</p>
   <p>The advantage of a reform in diet is obviously greater than that of any other . It strikes at the root of the evil . To remedy the abuses of legislation , before we annihilate the propensities by which they are produced , is to suppose that by taking away the effect the cause will cease to operate . But the efficacy of this system depends entirely on the proselytism of individuals , and grounds its merits , as a benefit to the community , upon the total change of the dietetic habits in its members . It proceeds securely from a number of particular cases to one that is universal , and has this advantage over the contrary mode , that one error does not invalidate all that has gone before .</p>
   <p>Let not too much , however , be expected from this system . The healthiest among us is not exempt from hereditary disease . The most symmetrical , athletic , and longlived is a being inexpressibly inferior to what he would have been , had not the unnatural habits of his ancestors accumulated for him a certain portion of malady and deformity . In the most perfect specimen of civilized man , something is still found wanting by the physiological critic . Can a return to nature , then , instantaneously eradicate predispositions that have been slowly taking root in the silence of innumerable ages ?— Indubitably not . All that I contend for is , that from the moment of the relinquishing all unnatural habits no new disease is generated ; and that the predisposition to hereditary maladies gradually perishes , for want of its accustomed supply . In cases of consumption , cancer , gout , asthma , and scrofula , such is the invariable tendency of a diet of vegetables and pure water .</p>
   <p>Those who may be induced by these remarks to give the vegetable system a fair trial , should , in the first place , date the commencement of their practice from the moment of their conviction . All depends upon breaking through a pernicious habit resolutely and at once . Dr. Trotter asserts that no drunkard was ever reformed by gradually relinquishing his dram . ( See Trotter on the Nervous Temperament . ) Animal flesh , in its effects on the human stomach , is analogous to a dram . It is similar in the kind , though differing in the degree , of its operation . The proselyte to a pure diet must be warned to expect a temporary diminution of muscular strength . The subtraction of a powerful stimulus will suffice to account for this event . But it is only temporary , and is succeeded by an equable capability for exertion , far surpassing his former various and fluctuating strength . Above all , he will acquire an easiness of breathing , by which such exertion is performed , with a remarkable exemption from that painful and difficult panting now felt by almost every one after hastily climbing an ordinary mountain . He will be equally capable of bodily exertion , or mental application , after as before his simple meal . He will feel none of the narcotic effects of ordinary diet . Irritability , the direct consequence of exhausting stimuli , would yield to the power of natural and tranquil impulses . He will no longer pine under the lethargy of ennui , that unconquerable weariness of life , more to be dreaded than death itself . He will escape the epidemic madness , which broods over its own injurious notions of the Deity , and ‘ realizes the hell that priests and beldams feign . ’ Every man forms , as it were , his god from his own character ; to the divinity of one of simple habits no offering would be more acceptable than the happiness of his creatures . He would be incapable of hating or persecuting others for the love of God . He will find , moreover , a system of simple diet to be a system of perfect epicurism . He will no longer be incessantly occupied in blunting and destroying those organs from which he expects his gratification . The pleasures of taste to be derived from a dinner of potatoes , beans , peas , turnips , lettuces , with a dessert of apples , gooseberries , strawberries , currants , raspberries , and in winter , oranges , apples and pears , is far greater than is supposed . These who wait until they can eat this plain fare with the sauce of appetite will scarcely join with the hypocritical sensualist at a lord-mayor 's feast , who declaims against the pleasures of the table . Solomon kept a thousand concubines , and owned in despair that all was vanity . The man whose happiness is constituted by the society of one amiable woman would find some difficulty in sympathizing with the disappointment of this venerable debauchee .</p>
   <p>I address myself not only to the young enthusiast , the ardent devotee of truth and virtue , the pure and passionate moralist , yet unvitiated by the contagion of the world . He will embrace a pure system , from its abstract truth , its beauty , its simplicity , and its promise of wide-extended benefit ; unless custom has turned poison into food , he will hate the brutal pleasures of the chase by instinct ; it will be a contemplation full of horror , and disappointment to his mind , that beings capable of the gentlest and most admirable sympathies should take delight in the death-pangs and last convulsions of dying animals . The elderly man , whose youth has been poisoned by intemperance , or who has lived with apparent moderation , and is afflicted with a wide variety of painful maladies , would find his account in a beneficial change produced without the risk of poisonous medicines . The mother , to whom the perpetual restlessness of disease and unaccountable deaths incident to her children are the causes of incurable unhappiness , would on this diet experience the satisfaction of beholding their perpetual healths and natural playfulness . ( See Mr. Newton 's book . His children are the most beautiful and healthy creatures it is possible to conceive ; the girls are perfect models for a sculptor ; their dispositions are also the most gentle and conciliating ; the judicious treatment , which they experience in other points , may be a correlative cause of this . In the first five years of their life , of 18 , 000 children that are born , 7 , 500 die of various diseases ; and how many more of those that survive are not rendered miserable by maladies not immediately mortal ? The quality and quantity of a woman 's milk are materially injured by the use of dead flesh . In an island near Iceland , where no vegetables are to be got , the children invariably die of tetanus before they are three weeks old , and the population is supplied from the mainland .— Sir G. Mackenzie 's “ History of Iceland ” . See also “ Emile ” , chapter 1 , pages 53 , 54 , 56 . ) The most valuable lives are daily destroyed by diseases that it is dangerous to palliate and impossible to cure by medicine . How much longer will man continue to pimp for the gluttony of Death , his most insidious , implacable , and eternal foe ?</p>

   <p>NOTE ON QUEEN MAB , BY MRS. SHELLEY .</p>
   <p>Shelley was eighteen when he wrote “ Queen Mab ” ; he never published it . When it was written , he had come to the decision that he was too young to be a ‘ judge of controversies ’ ; and he was desirous of acquiring ‘ that sobriety of spirit which is the characteristic of true heroism . ’ But he never doubted the truth or utility of his opinions ; and , in printing and privately distributing “ Queen Mab ” , he believed that he should further their dissemination , without occasioning the mischief either to others or himself that might arise from publication . It is doubtful whether he would himself have admitted it into a collection of his works . His severe classical taste , refined by the constant study of the Greek poets , might have discovered defects that escape the ordinary reader ; and the change his opinions underwent in many points would have prevented him from putting forth the speculations of his boyish days . But the poem is too beautiful in itself , and far too remarkable as the production of a boy of eighteen , to allow of its being passed over : besides that , having been frequently reprinted , the omission would be vain . In the former edition certain portions were left out , as shocking the general reader from the violence of their attack on religion . I myself had a painful feeling that such erasures might be looked upon as a mark of disrespect towards the author , and am glad to have the opportunity of restoring them . The notes also are reprinted entire — not because they are models of reasoning or lessons of truth , but because Shelley wrote them , and that all that a man at once so distinguished and so excellent ever did deserves to be preserved . The alterations his opinions underwent ought to be recorded , for they form his history .</p>
   <p>A series of articles was published in the “ New Monthly Magazine ” during the autumn of the year 1832 , written by a man of great talent , a fellow-collegian and warm friend of Shelley : they describe admirably the state of his mind during his collegiate life . Inspired with ardour for the acquisition of knowledge , endowed with the keenest sensibility and with the fortitude of a martyr , Shelley came among his fellow-creatures , congregated for the purposes of education , like a spirit from another sphere ; too delicately organized for the rough treatment man uses towards man , especially in the season of youth , and too resolute in carrying out his own sense of good and justice , not to become a victim . To a devoted attachment to those he loved he added a determined resistance to oppression . Refusing to fag at Eton , he was treated with revolting cruelty by masters and boys : this roused instead of taming his spirit , and he rejected the duty of obedience when it was enforced by menaces and punishment . To aversion to the society of his fellow-creatures , such as he found them when collected together in societies , where one egged on the other to acts of tyranny , was joined the deepest sympathy and compassion ; while the attachment he felt for individuals , and the admiration with which he regarded their powers and their virtues , led him to entertain a high opinion of the perfectibility of human nature ; and he believed that all could reach the highest grade of moral improvement , did not the customs and prejudices of society foster evil passions and excuse evil actions .</p>
   <p>The oppression which , trembling at every nerve yet resolute to heroism , it was his ill-fortune to encounter at school and at college , led him to dissent in all things from those whose arguments were blows , whose faith appeared to engender blame and hatred . ‘ During my existence , ’ he wrote to a friend in 1812 , ‘ I have incessantly speculated , thought , and read . ’ His readings were not always well chosen ; among them were the works of the French philosophers : as far as metaphysical argument went , he temporarily became a convert . At the same time , it was the cardinal article of his faith that , if men were but taught and induced to treat their fellows with love , charity , and equal rights , this earth would realize paradise . He looked upon religion , as it is professed , and above all practised , as hostile instead of friendly to the cultivation of those virtues which would make men brothers .</p>
   <p>Can this be wondered at ? At the age of seventeen , fragile in health and frame , of the purest habits in morals , full of devoted generosity and universal kindness , glowing with ardour to attain wisdom , resolved at every personal sacrifice to do right , burning with a desire for affection and sympathy ,— he was treated as a reprobate , cast forth as a criminal .</p>
   <p>The cause was that he was sincere ; that he believed the opinions which he entertained to be true . And he loved truth with a martyr 's love ; he was ready to sacrifice station and fortune , and his dearest affections , at its shrine . The sacrifice was demanded from , and made by , a youth of seventeen . It is a singular fact in the history of society in the civilized nations of modern times that no false step is so irretrievable as one made in early youth . Older men , it is true , when they oppose their fellows and transgress ordinary rules , carry a certain prudence or hypocrisy as a shield along with them . But youth is rash ; nor can it imagine , while asserting what it believes to be true , and doing what it believes to be right , that it should be denounced as vicious , and pursued as a criminal .</p>
   <p>Shelley possessed a quality of mind which experience has shown me to be of the rarest occurrence among human beings : this was his UNWORLDLINESS . The usual motives that rule men , prospects of present or future advantage , the rank and fortune of those around , the taunts and censures , or the praise , of those who were hostile to him , had no influence whatever over his actions , and apparently none over his thoughts . It is difficult even to express the simplicity and directness of purpose that adorned him . Some few might be found in the history of mankind , and some one at least among his own friends , equally disinterested and scornful , even to severe personal sacrifices , of every baser motive . But no one , I believe , ever joined this noble but passive virtue to equal active endeavours for the benefit of his friends and mankind in general , and to equal power to produce the advantages he desired . The world 's brightest gauds and its most solid advantages were of no worth in his eyes , when compared to the cause of what he considered truth , and the good of his fellow-creatures . Born in a position which , to his inexperienced mind , afforded the greatest facilities to practise the tenets he espoused , he boldly declared the use he would make of fortune and station , and enjoyed the belief that he should materially benefit his fellow-creatures by his actions ; while , conscious of surpassing powers of reason and imagination , it is not strange that he should , even while so young , have believed that his written thoughts would tend to disseminate opinions which he believed conducive to the happiness of the human race .</p>
   <p>If man were a creature devoid of passion , he might have said and done all this with quietness . But he was too enthusiastic , and too full of hatred of all the ills he witnessed , not to scorn danger . Various disappointments tortured , but could not tame , his soul . The more enmity he met , the more earnestly he became attached to his peculiar views , and hostile to those of the men who persecuted him .</p>
   <p>He was animated to greater zeal by compassion for his fellow-creatures . His sympathy was excited by the misery with which the world is burning . He witnessed the sufferings of the poor , and was aware of the evils of ignorance . He desired to induce every rich man to despoil himself of superfluity , and to create a brotherhood of property and service , and was ready to be the first to lay down the advantages of his birth . He was of too uncompromising a disposition to join any party . He did not in his youth look forward to gradual improvement : nay , in those days of intolerance , now almost forgotten , it seemed as easy to look forward to the sort of millennium of freedom and brotherhood which he thought the proper state of mankind as to the present reign of moderation and improvement . Ill-health made him believe that his race would soon be run ; that a year or two was all he had of life . He desired that these years should be useful and illustrious . He saw , in a fervent call on his fellow-creatures to share alike the blessings of the creation , to love and serve each other , the noblest work that life and time permitted him . In this spirit he composed “ Queen Mab ” .</p>
   <p>He was a lover of the wonderful and wild in literature , but had not fostered these tastes at their genuine sources — the romances and chivalry of the middle ages — but in the perusal of such German works as were current in those days . Under the influence of these he , at the age of fifteen , wrote two short prose romances of slender merit . The sentiments and language were exaggerated , the composition imitative and poor . He wrote also a poem on the subject of Ahasuerus — being led to it by a German fragment he picked up , dirty and torn , in Lincoln 's Inn Fields . This fell afterwards into other hands , and was considerably altered before it was printed . Our earlier English poetry was almost unknown to him . The love and knowledge of Nature developed by Wordsworth — the lofty melody and mysterious beauty of Coleridge 's poetry — and the wild fantastic machinery and gorgeous scenery adopted by Southey — composed his favourite reading ; the rhythm of “ Queen Mab ” was founded on that of “ Thalaba ” , and the first few lines bear a striking resemblance in spirit , though not in idea , to the opening of that poem . His fertile imagination , and ear tuned to the finest sense of harmony , preserved him from imitation . Another of his favourite books was the poem of “ Gebir ” by Walter Savage Landor . From his boyhood he had a wonderful facility of versification , which he carried into another language ; and his Latin school-verses were composed with an ease and correctness that procured for him prizes , and caused him to be resorted to by all his friends for help . He was , at the period of writing “ Queen Mab ” , a great traveller within the limits of England , Scotland , and Ireland . His time was spent among the loveliest scenes of these countries . Mountain and lake and forest were his home ; the phenomena of Nature were his favourite study . He loved to inquire into their causes , and was addicted to pursuits of natural philosophy and chemistry , as far as they could be carried on as an amusement . These tastes gave truth and vivacity to his descriptions , and warmed his soul with that deep admiration for the wonders of Nature which constant association with her inspired .</p>
   <p>He never intended to publish “ Queen Mab ” as it stands ; but a few years after , when printing “ Alastor ” , he extracted a small portion which he entitled “ The Daemon of the World ” . In this he changed somewhat the versification , and made other alterations scarcely to be called improvements .</p>
   <p>Some years after , when in Italy , a bookseller published an edition of “ Queen Mab ” as it originally stood . Shelley was hastily written to by his friends , under the idea that , deeply injurious as the mere distribution of the poem had proved , the publication might awaken fresh persecutions . At the suggestion of these friends he wrote a letter on the subject , printed in the “ Examiner ” newspaper — with which I close this history of his earliest work .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>TO THE EDITOR OF THE ‘ EXAMINER . ’</head>
     <l n="1">‘ Sir ,</l>
   </lg>
   <p>‘ Having heard that a poem entitled “ Queen Mab ” has been surreptitiously published in London , and that legal proceedings have been instituted against the publisher , I request the favour of your insertion of the following explanation of the affair , as it relates to me .</p>
   <p>‘ A poem entitled “ Queen Mab ” was written by me at the age of eighteen , I daresay in a sufficiently intemperate spirit — but even then was not intended for publication , and a few copies only were struck off , to be distributed among my personal friends . I have not seen this production for several years . I doubt not but that it is perfectly worthless in point of literary composition ; and that , in all that concerns moral and political speculation , as well as in the subtler discriminations of metaphysical and religious doctrine , it is still more crude and immature . I am a devoted enemy to religious , political , and domestic oppression ; and I regret this publication , not so much from literary vanity , as because I fear it is better fitted to injure than to serve the sacred cause of freedom . I have directed my solicitor to apply to Chancery for an injunction to restrain the sale ; but , after the precedent of Mr. Southey 's “ Wat Tyler ” ( a poem written , I believe , at the same age , and with the same unreflecting enthusiasm ) , with little hope of success .</p>
   <p>‘ Whilst I exonerate myself from all share in having divulged opinions hostile to existing sanctions , under the form , whatever it may be , which they assume in this poem , it is scarcely necessary for me to protest against the system of inculcating the truth of Christianity or the excellence of Monarchy , however true or however excellent they may be , by such equivocal arguments as confiscation and imprisonment , and invective and slander , and the insolent violation of the most sacred ties of Nature and society .</p>

   <p>DEATH : For my dagger is bathed in the blood of the brave , I come , care-worn tenant of life , from the grave , Where Innocence sleeps ‘ neath the peace-giving sod , And the good cease to tremble at Tyranny 's nod ; I offer a calm habitation to thee ,— 5 Say , victim of grief , wilt thou slumber with me ? My mansion is damp , cold silence is there , But it lulls in oblivion the fiends of despair ; Not a groan of regret , not a sigh , not a breath , Dares dispute with grim Silence the empire of Death . 10 I offer a calm habitation to thee ,— Say , victim of grief , wilt thou slumber with me ?</p>
   <p>MORTAL : Mine eyelids are heavy ; my soul seeks repose , It longs in thy cells to embosom its woes , It longs in thy cells to deposit its load , 15 Where no longer the scorpions of Perfidy goad ,— Where the phantoms of Prejudice vanish away , And Bigotry 's bloodhounds lose scent of their prey . Yet tell me , dark Death , when thine empire is o'er , What awaits on Futurity 's mist-covered shore ? 20</p>
   <p>DEATH : Cease , cease , wayward Mortal ! I dare not unveil The shadows that float o'er Eternity 's vale ; Nought waits for the good but a spirit of Love , That will hail their blest advent to regions above . For Love , Mortal , gleams through the gloom of my sway , 25 And the shades which surround me fly fast at its ray . Hast thou loved ?— Then depart from these regions of hate , And in slumber with me blunt the arrows of fate . I offer a calm habitation to thee .— Say , victim of grief , wilt thou slumber with me ? 30</p>
   <p>MORTAL : Oh ! sweet is thy slumber ! oh ! sweet is the ray Which after thy night introduces the day ; How concealed , how persuasive , self-interest 's breath , Though it floats to mine ear from the bosom of Death ! I hoped that I quite was forgotten by all , 35 Yet a lingering friend might be grieved at my fall , And duty forbids , though I languish to die , When departure might heave Virtue 's breast with a sigh . O Death ! O my friend ! snatch this form to thy shrine , And I fear , dear destroyer , I shall not repine . 40</p>

    <p>TO THE MOONBEAM . [ Published by Hogg , “ Life of Shelley ” , 1858 : dated 1809 . Included in the Esdaile manuscript book . ] 1 . Moonbeam , leave the shadowy vale , To bathe this burning brow . Moonbeam , why art thou so pale , As thou walkest o'er the dewy dale , Where humble wild-flowers grow ? 5 Is it to mimic me ? But that can never be ; For thine orb is bright , And the clouds are light , That at intervals shadow the star-studded night . 10 2 . Now all is deathy still on earth ; Nature 's tired frame reposes ; And , ere the golden morning 's birth Its radiant hues discloses , Flies forth its balmy breath . 15 But mine is the midnight of Death , And Nature 's morn To my bosom forlorn Brings but a gloomier night , implants a deadlier thorn . 3 . Wretch ! Suppress the glare of madness 20 Struggling in thine haggard eye , For the keenest throb of sadness , Pale Despair 's most sickening sigh , Is but to mimic me ; And this must ever be , 25 When the twilight of care , And the night of despair , Seem in my breast but joys to the pangs that rankle there .</p>

    <p>TO DEATH . [ Published ( without title ) by Hogg , “ Life of Shelley ” , 1858 ; dated 1810 . Included ( under the title , “ To Death ” ) in the Esdaile manuscript book . ] Death ! where is thy victory ? To triumph whilst I die , To triumph whilst thine ebon wing Enfolds my shuddering soul ? O Death ! where is thy sting ? 5 Not when the tides of murder roll , When nations groan , that kings may bask in bliss , Death ! canst thou boast a victory such as this — When in his hour of pomp and power His blow the mightiest murderer gave , 10 Mid Nature 's cries the sacrifice Of millions to glut the grave ; When sunk the Tyrant Desolation 's slave ; Or Freedom 's life-blood streamed upon thy shrine ; Stern Tyrant , couldst thou boast a victory such as mine ? 15 To know in dissolution 's void That mortals ’ baubles sunk decay ; That everything , but Love , destroyed Must perish with its kindred clay ,— Perish Ambition 's crown , 20 Perish her sceptred sway : From Death 's pale front fades Pride 's fastidious frown . In Death 's damp vault the lurid fires decay , That Envy lights at heaven-born Virtue 's beam — That all the cares subside , 25 Which lurk beneath the tide Of life 's unquiet stream ;— Yes ! this is victory ! And on yon rock , whose dark form glooms the sky , To stretch these pale limbs , when the soul is fled ; 30 To baffle the lean passions of their prey , To sleep within the palace of the dead ! Oh ! not the King , around whose dazzling throne His countless courtiers mock the words they say , Triumphs amid the bud of glory blown , 35 As I in this cold bed , and faint expiring groan ! Tremble , ye proud , whose grandeur mocks the woe Which props the column of unnatural state ! You the plainings , faint and low , From Misery 's tortured soul that flow , 40 Shall usher to your fate . Tremble , ye conquerors , at whose fell command The war-fiend riots o'er a peaceful land ! You Desolation 's gory throng Shall bear from Victory along 45 To that mysterious strand .</p>

    <p n="18">A Person complained that whenever he began to write , he never could arrange his ideas in grammatical order . Which occasion suggested the idea of the following lines :</p>
    <p n="19">1 . Here I sit with my paper , my pen and my ink , First of this thing , and that thing , and t'other thing think ; Then my thoughts come so pell-mell all into my mind , That the sense or the subject I never can find : This word is wrong placed ,— no regard to the sense , The present and future , instead of past tense , Then my grammar I want ; O dear ! what a bore , I think I shall never attempt to write more , With patience I then my thoughts must arraign , Have them all in due order like mutes in a train , 10 Like them too must wait in due patience and thought , Or else my fine works will all come to nought . My wit too 's so copious , it flows like a river , But disperses its waters on black and white never ; Like smoke it appears independent and free , 15 But ah luckless smoke ! it all passes like thee — Then at length all my patience entirely lost , My paper and pens in the fire are tossed ; But come , try again — you must never despair , Our Murray 's or Entick 's are not all so rare , 20 Implore their assistance — they 'll come to your aid , Perform all your business without being paid , They 'll tell you the present tense , future and past , Which should come first , and which should come last , This Murray will do — then to Entick repair , 25 To find out the meaning of any word rare . This they friendly will tell , and ne'er make you blush , With a jeering look , taunt , or an O fie ! tush ! Then straight all your thoughts in black and white put , Not minding the if 's , the be 's , and the but , 30 Then read it all over , see how it will run , How answers the wit , the retort , and the pun , Your writings may then with old Socrates vie , May on the same shelf with Demosthenes lie , May as Junius be sharp , or as Plato be sage . 35 The pattern or satire to all of the age ; But stop — a mad author I mean not to turn , Nor with thirst of applause does my heated brain burn , Sufficient that sense , wit , and grammar combined , My letters may make some slight food for the mind ; 40 That my thoughts to my friends I may freely impart , In all the warm language that flows from the heart . Hark ! futurity calls ! it loudly complains , It bids me step forward and just hold the reins , My excuse shall be humble , and faithful , and true , 45 Such as I fear can be made but by few — Of writers this age has abundance and plenty , Three score and a thousand , two millions and twenty , Three score of them wits who all sharply vie , To try what odd creature they best can belie , 50 A thousand are prudes who for CHARITY write , And fill up their sheets with spleen , envy , and spite [,] One million are bards , who to Heaven aspire , And stuff their works full of bombast , rant , and fire , T'other million are wags who in Grubstreet attend , 55 And just like a cobbler the old writings mend , The twenty are those who for pulpits indite , And pore over sermons all Saturday night . And now my good friends — who come after I mean , As I ne'er wore a cassock , or dined with a dean . 60 Or like cobblers at mending I never did try , Nor with poets in lyrics attempted to vie ; As for prudes these good souls I both hate and detest , So here I believe the matter must rest .— I 've heard your complaint — my answer I 've made , 65 And since to your calls all the tribute I 've paid , Adieu my good friend ; pray never despair , But grammar and sense and everything dare , Attempt but to write dashing , easy , and free , Then take out your grammar and pay him his fee , 70 Be not a coward , shrink not to a tense , But read it all over and make it out sense . What a tiresome girl !— pray soon make an end , Else my limited patience you 'll quickly expend . Well adieu , I no longer your patience will try — 75 So swift to the post now the letter shall fly .</p>

    <p n="22">TO MISS — — [ HARRIET GROVE ] FROM MISS — — [ ELIZABETH SHELLEY ] .</p>
    <p n="23">For your letter , dear — [ Hattie ] , accept my best thanks , Rendered long and amusing by virtue of franks , Though concise they would please , yet the longer the better , The more news that 's crammed in , more amusing the letter , All excuses of etiquette nonsense I hate , 5 Which only are fit for the tardy and late , As when converse grows flat , of the weather they talk , How fair the sun shines — a fine day for a walk , Then to politics turn , of Burdett 's reformation , One declares it would hurt , t'other better the nation , 10 Will ministers keep ? sure they 've acted quite wrong , The burden this is of each morning-call song . So — is going to — you say , I hope that success her great efforts will pay [—] That [ the Colonel ] will see her , be dazzled outright , 15 And declare he can n't bear to be out of her sight . Write flaming epistles with love 's pointed dart , Whose sharp little arrow struck right on his heart , Scold poor innocent Cupid for mischievous ways , He knows not how much to laud forth her praise , 20 That he neither eats , drinks or sleeps for her sake , And hopes her hard heart some compassion will take , A refusal would kill him , so desperate his flame , But he fears , for he knows she is not common game , Then praises her sense , wit , discernment and grace , 25 He 's not one that 's caught by a sly looking face , Yet that 's TOO divine — such a black sparkling eye , At the bare glance of which near a thousand will die ; Thus runs he on meaning but one word in ten , More than is meant by most such kind of men , 30 For they 're all alike , take them one with another , Begging pardon — with the exception of my brother . Of the drawings you mention much praise I have heard , Most opinion 's the same , with the difference of word , Some get a good name by the voice of the crowd , 35 Whilst to poor humble merit small praise is allowed , As in parliament votes , so in pictures a name , Oft determines a fate at the altar of fame .— So on Friday this City 's gay vortex you quit , And no longer with Doctors and Johnny cats sit — 40 Now your parcel 's arrived — [ Bysshe 's ] letter shall go , I hope all your joy may n't be turned into woe , Experience will tell you that pleasure is vain , When it promises sunshine how often comes rain . So when to fond hope every blessing is nigh , 45 How oft when we smile it is checked with a sigh , When Hope , gay deceiver , in pleasure is dressed , How oft comes a stroke that may rob us of rest . When we think ourselves safe , and the goal near at hand , Like a vessel just landing , we 're wrecked near the strand , 50 And though memory forever the sharp pang must feel , ‘ Tis our duty to bear , and our hardship to steel — May misfortunes dear Girl , ne'er thy happiness cloy , May thy days glide in peace , love , comfort and joy , May thy tears with soft pity for other woes flow , 55 Woes , which thy tender heart never may know , For hardships our own , God has taught us to bear , Though sympathy 's soul to a friend drops a tear . Oh dear ! what sentimental stuff have I written , Only fit to tear up and play with a kitten . 60 What sober reflections in the midst of this letter ! Jocularity sure would have suited much better ; But there are exceptions to all common rules , For this is a truth by all boys learned at schools . Now adieu my dear — [ Hattie ] I 'm sure I must tire , 65 For if I do , you may throw it into the fire , So accept the best love of your cousin and friend , Which brings this nonsensical rhyme to an end .</p>

    <p n="27">Cold , cold is the blast when December is howling , Cold are the damps on a dying man 's brow ,— Stern are the seas when the wild waves are rolling , And sad is the grave where a loved one lies low ; But colder is scorn from the being who loved thee , 5 More stern is the sneer from the friend who has proved thee , More sad are the tears when their sorrows have moved thee , Which mixed with groans anguish and wild madness flow —</p>
    <p n="28">And ah ! poor — has felt all this horror , Full long the fallen victim contended with fate : 10 ‘ Till a destitute outcast abandoned to sorrow , She sought her babe 's food at her ruiner 's gate — Another had charmed the remorseless betrayer , He turned laughing aside from her moans and her prayer , She said nothing , but wringing the wet from her hair , 15 Crossed the dark mountain side , though the hour it was late . ‘ Twas on the wild height of the dark Penmanmawr , That the form of the wasted — reclined ; She shrieked to the ravens that croaked from afar , And she sighed to the gusts of the wild sweeping wind .— 20 I call not yon rocks where the thunder peals rattle , I call not yon clouds where the elements battle , But thee , cruel — I call thee unkind ! ’ —</p>
    <p n="29">Then she wreathed in her hair the wild flowers of the mountain , And deliriously laughing , a garland entwined , 25 She bedewed it with tears , then she hung o'er the fountain , And leaving it , cast it a prey to the wind . ‘ Ah ! go , ’ she exclaimed , ‘ when the tempest is yelling , ‘ Tis unkind to be cast on the sea that is swelling , But I left , a pitiless outcast , my dwelling , 30 My garments are torn , so they say is my mind — ’</p>
    <p n="30">Not long lived —, but over her grave Waved the desolate form of a storm-blasted yew , Around it no demons or ghosts dare to rave , But spirits of peace steep her slumbers in dew . 35 Then stay thy swift steps mid the dark mountain heather , Though chill blow the wind and severe is the weather , For perfidy , traveller ! cannot bereave her , Of the tears , to the tombs of the innocent due .—</p>

    <p n="42">Who looks around with fearful eye , And shuns all converse with man kind , 10 As though some one his griefs might spy , And soothe them with a kindred mind .</p>
    <p n="43">A friend or foe to him the same , He looks on each with equal eye ; The difference lies but in the name , 15 To none for comfort can he fly .—</p>

    <p n="50">To me this world 's a dreary blank , All hopes in life are gone and fled , My high strung energies are sank , And all my blissful hopes lie dead .—</p>
    <p n="51">The world once smiling to my view , 5 Showed scenes of endless bliss and joy ; The world I then but little knew , Ah ! little knew how pleasures cloy ;</p>
    <p n="52">All then was jocund , all was gay , No thought beyond the present hour , 10 I danced in pleasure 's fading ray , Fading alas ! as drooping flower .</p>

    <p n="54">The heart that bears deep sorrow 's trace , What earthly comfort can console , It drags a dull and lengthened pace , ‘ Till friendly death its woes enroll .— 20</p>
    <p n="55">The sunken cheek , the humid eyes , E'en better than the tongue can tell ; In whose sad breast deep sorrow lies , Where memory 's rankling traces dwell .—</p>
    <p n="56">The rising tear , the stifled sigh , 25 A mind but ill at ease display , Like blackening clouds in stormy sky , Where fiercely vivid lightnings play .</p>
    <p n="57">Thus when souls ’ energy is dead , When sorrow dims each earthly view , 30 When every fairy hope is fled , We bid ungrateful world adieu .</p>

    <p n="111">14 . SAINT EDMOND 'S EVE .</p>
    <p n="112">Oh ! did you observe the Black Canon pass , And did you observe his frown ? He goeth to say the midnight mass , In holy St. Edmond 's town .</p>
    <p n="113">He goeth to sing the burial chaunt , 5 And to lay the wandering sprite , Whose shadowy , restless form doth haunt , The Abbey 's drear aisle this night .</p>
    <p n="114">It saith it will not its wailing cease , ‘ Till that holy man come near , 10 ‘ Till he pour o'er its grave the prayer of peace , And sprinkle the hallowed tear .</p>
    <p n="115">The Canon 's horse is stout and strong The road is plain and fair , But the Canon slowly wends along , 15 And his brow is gloomed with care .</p>
    <p n="116">Who is it thus late at the Abbey-gate ? Sullen echoes the portal bell , It sounds like the whispering voice of fate , It sounds like a funeral knell . 20</p>
    <p n="117">The Canon his faltering knee thrice bowed , And his frame was convulsed with fear , When a voice was heard distinct and loud , ‘ Prepare ! for thy hour is near . ’</p>
    <p n="118">He crosses his breast , he mutters a prayer , 25 To Heaven he lifts his eye , He heeds not the Abbot 's gazing stare , Nor the dark Monks who murmured by .</p>
    <p n="119">Bare-headed he worships the sculptured saints That frown on the sacred walls , 30 His face it grows pale ,— he trembles , he faints , At the Abbot 's feet he falls .</p>
    <p n="120">And straight the father 's robe he kissed , Who cried , ‘ Grace dwells with thee , The spirit will fade like the morning mist , 35 At your benedicite .</p>
    <p n="121">‘ Now haste within ! the board is spread , Keen blows the air , and cold , The spectre sleeps in its earthy bed , ‘ Till St. Edmond 's bell hath tolled ,— 40</p>
    <p n="122">‘ Yet rest your wearied limbs to-night , You 've journeyed many a mile , To-morrow lay the wailing sprite , That shrieks in the moonlight aisle .</p>
    <p n="123">‘ Oh ! faint are my limbs and my bosom is cold , 45 Yet to-night must the sprite be laid , Yet to-night when the hour of horror 's told , Must I meet the wandering shade .</p>
    <p n="124">‘ Nor food , nor rest may now delay ,— For hark ! the echoing pile , 50 A bell loud shakes !— Oh haste away , O lead to the haunted aisle . ’</p>
    <p n="125">The torches slowly move before , The cross is raised on high , A smile of peace the Canon wore , 55 But horror dimmed his eye —</p>
    <p n="126">And now they climb the footworn stair , The chapel gates unclose , Now each breathed low a fervent prayer , And fear each bosom froze — 60</p>
    <p n="127">Now paused awhile the doubtful band And viewed the solemn scene ,— Full dark the clustered columns stand , The moon gleams pale between —</p>
    <p n="128">‘ Say father , say , what cloisters ’ gloom 65 Conceals the unquiet shade , Within what dark unhallowed tomb , The corse unblessed was laid . ’</p>
    <p n="129">‘ Through yonder drear aisle alone it walks , And murmurs a mournful plaint , 70 Of thee ! Black Canon , it wildly talks , And call on thy patron saint —</p>
    <p n="130">The pilgrim this night with wondering eyes , As he prayed at St. Edmond 's shrine , From a black marble tomb hath seen it rise , 75 And under yon arch recline . ’ —</p>
    <p n="131">‘ Oh ! say upon that black marble tomb , What memorial sad appears . ’ — ‘ Undistinguished it lies in the chancel 's gloom , No memorial sad it bears ’ — 80</p>
    <p n="132">The Canon his paternoster reads , His rosary hung by his side , Now swift to the chancel doors he leads , And untouched they open wide ,</p>
    <p n="133">Resistless , strange sounds his steps impel , 85 To approach to the black marble tomb , ‘ Oh ! enter , Black Canon , ’ a whisper fell , ‘ Oh ! enter , thy hour is come . ’</p>
    <p n="134">He paused , told his beads , and the threshold passed . Oh ! horror , the chancel doors close , 90 A loud yell was borne on the rising blast , And a deep , dying groan arose .</p>
    <p n="135">The Monks in amazement shuddering stand , They burst through the chancel 's gloom , From St. Edmond 's shrine , lo ! a skeleton 's hand , 95 Points to the black marble tomb .</p>
    <p n="136">Lo ! deeply engraved , an inscription blood red , In characters fresh and clear — ‘ The guilty Black Canon of Elmham 's dead , And his wife lies buried here ! ’ 100</p>
    <p n="137">In Elmham 's tower he wedded a Nun , To St. Edmond 's his bride he bore , On this eve her noviciate here was begun , And a Monk 's gray weeds she wore ;—</p>
    <p n="138">O ! deep was her conscience dyed with guilt , 105 Remorse she full oft revealed , Her blood by the ruthless Black Canon was spilt , And in death her lips he sealed ;</p>
    <p n="139">Her spirit to penance this night was doomed , ‘ Till the Canon atoned the deed , 110 Here together they now shall rest entombed , ‘ Till their bodies from dust are freed —</p>
    <p n="140">Hark ! a loud peal of thunder shakes the roof , Round the altar bright lightnings play , Speechless with horror the Monks stand aloof , 115 And the storm dies sudden away —</p>
    <p n="141">The inscription was gone ! a cross on the ground , And a rosary shone through the gloom , But never again was the Canon there found , Or the Ghost on the black marble tomb . 120</p>
    <p n="142">15 . REVENGE .</p>
    <p n="143">‘ Ah ! quit me not yet , for the wind whistles shrill , Its blast wanders mournfully over the hill , The thunder 's wild voice rattles madly above , You will not then , cannot then , leave me my love .— ’</p>
    <p n="144">I must dearest Agnes , the night is far gone — 5 I must wander this evening to Strasburg alone , I must seek the drear tomb of my ancestors ’ bones , And must dig their remains from beneath the cold stones .</p>
    <p n="145">‘ For the spirit of Conrad there meets me this night , And we quit not the tomb ‘ till dawn of the light , 10 And Conrad 's been dead just a month and a day ! So farewell dearest Agnes for I must away ,—</p>
    <p n="146">‘ He bid me bring with me what most I held dear , Or a month from that time should I lie on my bier , And I 'd sooner resign this false fluttering breath , 15 Than my Agnes should dread either danger or death ,</p>
    <p n="147">‘ And I love you to madness my Agnes I love , My constant affection this night will I prove , This night will I go to the sepulchre 's jaw Alone will I glut its all conquering maw ’ — 20</p>
    <p n="148">‘ No ! no loved Adolphus thy Agnes will share , In the tomb all the dangers that wait for you there , I fear not the spirit ,— I fear not the grave , My dearest Adolphus I 'd perish to save ’ —</p>
    <p n="149">‘ Nay seek not to say that thy love shall not go , 25 But spare me those ages of horror and woe , For I swear to thee here that I 'll perish ere day , If you go unattended by Agnes away ’ —</p>
    <p n="150">The night it was bleak the fierce storm raged around , The lightning 's blue fire-light flashed on the ground , 30 Strange forms seemed to flit ,— and howl tidings of fate , As Agnes advanced to the sepulchre gate .—</p>
    <p n="151">The youth struck the portal ,— the echoing sound Was fearfully rolled midst the tombstones around , The blue lightning gleamed o'er the dark chapel spire , 35 And tinged were the storm clouds with sulphurous fire .</p>
    <p n="152">Still they gazed on the tombstone where Conrad reclined , Yet they shrank at the cold chilling blast of the wind , When a strange silver brilliance pervaded the scene , And a figure advanced — tall in form — fierce in mien . 40</p>
    <p n="153">A mantle encircled his shadowy form , As light as a gossamer borne on the storm , Celestial terror sat throned in his gaze , Like the midnight pestiferous meteor 's blaze .—</p>
    <p n="154">SPIRIT : Thy father , Adolphus ! was false , false as hell , 45 And Conrad has cause to remember it well , He ruined my Mother , despised me his son , I quitted the world ere my vengeance was done .</p>
    <p n="155">I was nearly expiring — ‘ twas close of the day ,— A demon advanced to the bed where I lay , 50 He gave me the power from whence I was hurled , To return to revenge , to return to the world ,—</p>
    <p n="156">Now Adolphus I 'll seize thy best loved in my arms , I 'll drag her to Hades all blooming in charms , On the black whirlwind 's thundering pinion I 'll ride , 55 And fierce yelling fiends shall exult o'er thy bride —</p>
    <p n="157">He spoke , and extending his ghastly arms wide , Majestic advanced with a swift noiseless stride , He clasped the fair Agnes — he raised her on high , And cleaving the roof sped his way to the sky — 60</p>
    <p n="158">All was now silent ,— and over the tomb , Thicker , deeper , was swiftly extended a gloom , Adolphus in horror sank down on the stone , And his fleeting soul fled with a harrowing groan .</p>

    <p n="161">The idea of the following tale was taken from a few unconnected German Stanzas .— The principal Character is evidently the Wandering Jew , and although not mentioned by name , the burning Cross on his forehead undoubtedly alludes to that superstition , so prevalent in the part of Germany called the Black Forest , where this scene is supposed to lie .</p>
    <p n="162">Hark ! the owlet flaps her wing , In the pathless dell beneath , Hark ! night ravens loudly sing , Tidings of despair and death .—</p>
    <p n="163">Horror covers all the sky , 5 Clouds of darkness blot the moon , Prepare ! for mortal thou must die , Prepare to yield thy soul up soon —</p>
    <p n="164">Fierce the tempest raves around , Fierce the volleyed lightnings fly , 10 Crashing thunder shakes the ground , Fire and tumult fill the sky .—</p>
    <p n="165">Hark ! the tolling village bell , Tells the hour of midnight come , Now can blast the powers of Hell , 15 Fiend-like goblins now can roam —</p>
    <p n="166">See ! his crest all stained with rain , A warrior hastening speeds his way , He starts , looks round him , starts again , And sighs for the approach of day . 20</p>
    <p n="167">See ! his frantic steed he reins , See ! he lifts his hands on high , Implores a respite to his pains , From the powers of the sky .—</p>
    <p n="168">He seeks an Inn , for faint from toil , 25 Fatigue had bent his lofty form , To rest his wearied limbs awhile , Fatigued with wandering and the storm .</p>
    <p n="169">... ...</p>
    <p n="170">Slow the door is opened wide — With trackless tread a stranger came , 30 His form Majestic , slow his stride , He sate , nor spake ,— nor told his name —</p>
    <p n="171">Terror blanched the warrior 's cheek , Cold sweat from his forehead ran , In vain his tongue essayed to speak ,— 35 At last the stranger thus began :</p>
    <p n="172">‘ Mortal ! thou that saw'st the sprite , Tell me what I wish to know , Or come with me before ‘ tis light , Where cypress trees and mandrakes grow . 40</p>
    <p n="173">‘ Fierce the avenging Demon 's ire , Fiercer than the wintry blast , Fiercer than the lightning 's fire , When the hour of twilight 's past ’ —</p>
    <p n="174">The warrior raised his sunken eye . 45 It met the stranger 's sullen scowl , ‘ Mortal ! Mortal ! thou must die , ’ In burning letters chilled his soul .</p>
    <p n="175">WARRIOR : Stranger ! whoso'er you are , I feel impelled my tale to tell — 50 Horrors stranger shalt thou hear , Horrors drear as those of Hell .</p>
    <p n="176">O'er my Castle silence reigned , Late the night and drear the hour , When on the terrace I observed , 55 A fleeting shadowy mist to lower .—</p>
    <p n="177">Light the cloud as summer fog , Which transient shuns the morning beam ; Fleeting as the cloud on bog , That hangs or on the mountain stream .— 60</p>
    <p n="178">Horror seized my shuddering brain , Horror dimmed my starting eye . In vain I tried to speak ,— In vain My limbs essayed the spot to fly —</p>
    <p n="179">At last the thin and shadowy form , 65 With noiseless , trackless footsteps came ,— Its light robe floated on the storm , Its head was bound with lambent flame .</p>
    <p n="180">In chilling voice drear as the breeze Which sweeps along th ’ autumnal ground , 70 Which wanders through the leafless trees , Or the mandrake 's groan which floats around .</p>
    <p n="181">‘ Thou art mine and I am thine , ‘ Till the sinking of the world , I am thine and thou art mine , 75 ‘ Till in ruin death is hurled —</p>
    <p n="182">‘ Strong the power and dire the fate , Which drags me from the depths of Hell , Breaks the tomb 's eternal gate , Where fiendish shapes and dead men yell , 80</p>
    <p n="183">‘ Haply I might ne'er have shrank From flames that rack the guilty dead , Haply I might ne'er have sank On pleasure 's flowery , thorny bed —</p>
    <p n="184">— ‘ But stay ! no more I dare disclose , 85 Of the tale I wish to tell , On Earth relentless were my woes , But fiercer are my pangs in Hell —</p>
    <p n="185">‘ Now I claim thee as my love , Lay aside all chilling fear , 90 My affection will I prove , Where sheeted ghosts and spectres are !</p>
    <p n="186">‘ For thou art mine , and I am thine , ‘ Till the dreaded judgement day , I am thine , and thou art mine — 95 Night is past — I must away . ’</p>
    <p n="187">Still I gazed , and still the form Pressed upon my aching sight , Still I braved the howling storm , When the ghost dissolved in night .— 100</p>
    <p n="188">Restless , sleepless fled the night , Sleepless as a sick man 's bed , When he sighs for morning light , When he turns his aching head ,—</p>
    <p n="189">Slow and painful passed the day . 105 Melancholy seized my brain , Lingering fled the hours away , Lingering to a wretch in pain .—</p>
    <p n="190">At last came night , ah ! horrid hour , Ah ! chilling time that wakes the dead , 110 When demons ride the clouds that lower , — The phantom sat upon my bed .</p>
    <p n="191">In hollow voice , low as the sound Which in some charnel makes its moan , What floats along the burying ground , 115 The phantom claimed me as her own .</p>
    <p n="192">Her chilling finger on my head , With coldest touch congealed my soul — Cold as the finger of the dead , Or damps which round a tombstone roll — 120</p>
    <p n="193">Months are passed in lingering round , Every night the spectre comes , With thrilling step it shakes the ground , With thrilling step it round me roams —</p>
    <p n="194">Stranger ! I have told to thee , 125 All the tale I have to tell — Stranger ! canst thou tell to me , How to ‘ scape the powers of Hell ?—</p>
    <p n="195">STRANGER : Warrior ! I can ease thy woes , Wilt thou , wilt thou , come with me — 130 Warrior ! I can all disclose , Follow , follow , follow me .</p>
    <p n="196">Yet the tempest 's duskiest wing , Its mantle stretches o'er the sky , Yet the midnight ravens sing , 135 ‘ Mortal ! Mortal ! thou must die . ’</p>
    <p n="197">At last they saw a river clear , That crossed the heathy path they trod , The Stranger 's look was wild and drear , The firm Earth shook beneath his nod — 140</p>
    <p n="198">He raised a wand above his head , He traced a circle on the plain , In a wild verse he called the dead , The dead with silent footsteps came .</p>
    <p n="199">A burning brilliance on his head , 145 Flaming filled the stormy air , In a wild verse he called the dead , The dead in motley crowd were there .—</p>
    <p n="200">‘ Ghasta ! Ghasta ! come along , Bring thy fiendish crowd with thee , 150 Quickly raise th ’ avenging Song , Ghasta ! Ghasta ! come to me . ’</p>
    <p n="201">Horrid shapes in mantles gray , Flit athwart the stormy night , ‘ Ghasta ! Ghasta ! come away , 155 Come away before ‘ tis light . ’</p>
    <p n="202">See ! the sheeted Ghost they bring , Yelling dreadful o'er the heath , Hark ! the deadly verse they sing , Tidings of despair and death ! 160</p>
    <p n="203">The yelling Ghost before him stands , See ! she rolls her eyes around , Now she lifts her bony hands , Now her footsteps shake the ground .</p>
    <p n="204">STRANGER : Phantom of Theresa say , 165 Why to earth again you came , Quickly speak , I must away ! Or you must bleach for aye in flame ,—</p>
    <p n="205">PHANTOM : Mighty one I know thee now , Mightiest power of the sky , 170 Know thee by thy flaming brow , Know thee by thy sparkling eye .</p>
    <p n="206">That fire is scorching ! Oh ! I came , From the caverned depth of Hell , My fleeting false Rodolph to claim , 175 Mighty one ! I know thee well .—</p>
    <p n="207">STRANGER : Ghasta ! seize yon wandering sprite , Drag her to the depth beneath , Take her swift , before ‘ tis light , Take her to the cells of death ! 180</p>
    <p n="208">Thou that heardst the trackless dead , In the mouldering tomb must lie , Mortal ! look upon my head , Mortal ! Mortal ! thou must die .</p>
    <p n="209">Of glowing flame a cross was there , 185 Which threw a light around his form , Whilst his lank and raven hair , Floated wild upon the storm .—</p>
    <p n="210">The warrior upwards turned his eyes , Gazed upon the cross of fire , 190 There sat horror and surprise , There sat God 's eternal ire .—</p>
    <p n="211">A shivering through the Warrior flew , Colder than the nightly blast , Colder than the evening dew , 195 When the hour of twilight 's past .—</p>
    <p n="212">Thunder shakes th ’ expansive sky , Shakes the bosom of the heath , ‘ Mortal ! Mortal ! thou must die ’ — The warrior sank convulsed in death . 200</p>

    <p n="237">3 .— SISTER ROSA : A BALLAD .</p>
    <p n="238">1 . The death-bell beats !— The mountain repeats The echoing sound of the knell ; And the dark Monk now Wraps the cowl round his brow , 5 As he sits in his lonely cell .</p>
    <p n="239">2 . And the cold hand of death Chills his shuddering breath , As he lists to the fearful lay Which the ghosts of the sky , 10 As they sweep wildly by , Sing to departed day . And they sing of the hour When the stern fates had power To resolve Rosa 's form to its clay . 15</p>
    <p n="240">3 . But that hour is past ; And that hour was the last Of peace to the dark Monk 's brain . Bitter tears , from his eyes , gushed silent and fast ; And he strove to suppress them in vain . 20</p>
    <p n="241">4 . Then his fair cross of gold he dashed on the floor , When the death-knell struck on his ear .— ‘ Delight is in store For her evermore ; But for me is fate , horror , and fear . ’ 25</p>
    <p n="242">5 . Then his eyes wildly rolled , When the death-bell tolled , And he raged in terrific woe . And he stamped on the ground ,— But when ceased the sound , 30 Tears again began to flow .</p>
    <p n="243">6 . And the ice of despair Chilled the wild throb of care , And he sate in mute agony still ; Till the night-stars shone through the cloudless air , 35 And the pale moonbeam slept on the hill .</p>
    <p n="244">7 . Then he knelt in his cell :— And the horrors of hell Were delights to his agonized pain , And he prayed to God to dissolve the spell , 40 Which else must for ever remain .</p>
    <p n="245">8 . And in fervent pray'r he knelt on the ground , Till the abbey bell struck One : His feverish blood ran chill at the sound : A voice hollow and horrible murmured around — 45 ‘ The term of thy penance is done ! ’</p>
    <p n="246">9 . Grew dark the night ; The moonbeam bright Waxed faint on the mountain high ; And , from the black hill , 50 Went a voice cold and still ,— ‘ Monk ! thou art free to die . ’</p>
    <p n="247">10 . Then he rose on his feet , And his heart loud did beat , And his limbs they were palsied with dread ; 55 Whilst the grave 's clammy dew O'er his pale forehead grew ; And he shuddered to sleep with the dead .</p>
    <p n="248">11 . And the wild midnight storm Raved around his tall form , 60 As he sought the chapel 's gloom : And the sunk grass did sigh To the wind , bleak and high , As he searched for the new-made tomb .</p>
    <p n="249">12 . And forms , dark and high , 65 Seemed around him to fly , And mingle their yells with the blast : And on the dark wall Half-seen shadows did fall , As enhorrored he onward passed . 70</p>
    <p n="250">13 . And the storm-fiends wild rave O'er the new-made grave , And dread shadows linger around . The Monk called on God his soul to save , And , in horror , sank on the ground . 75</p>
    <p n="251">14 . Then despair nerved his arm To dispel the charm , And he burst Rosa 's coffin asunder . And the fierce storm did swell More terrific and fell , 80 And louder pealed the thunder .</p>
    <p n="252">15 . And laughed , in joy , the fiendish throng , Mixed with ghosts of the mouldering dead : And their grisly wings , as they floated along , Whistled in murmurs dread . 85</p>
    <p n="253">16 . And her skeleton form the dead Nun reared Which dripped with the chill dew of hell . In her half-eaten eyeballs two pale flames appeared , And triumphant their gleam on the dark Monk glared , As he stood within the cell . 90</p>
    <p n="254">17 . And her lank hand lay on his shuddering brain ; But each power was nerved by fear .— ‘ I never , henceforth , may breathe again ; Death now ends mine anguished pain .— The grave yawns ,— we meet there . ’ 95</p>
    <p n="255">18 . And her skeleton lungs did utter the sound , So deadly , so lone , and so fell , That in long vibrations shuddered the ground ; And as the stern notes floated around , A deep groan was answered from hell .</p>

    <p n="261">4 . But not alone on Irvyne 's tower , The silver moonbeam pours her ray ; It gleams upon the ivied bower , 15 It dances in the cascade 's spray .</p>

    <p n="266">1 . How stern are the woes of the desolate mourner , As he bends in still grief o'er the hallowed bier , As enanguished he turns from the laugh of the scorner , And drops , to Perfection 's remembrance , a tear ; When floods of despair down his pale cheek are streaming , 5 When no blissful hope on his bosom is beaming , Or , if lulled for awhile , soon he starts from his dreaming , And finds torn the soft ties to affection so dear .</p>
    <p n="267">2 . Ah ! when shall day dawn on the night of the grave , Or summer succeed to the winter of death ? 10 Rest awhile , hapless victim , and Heaven will save The spirit , that faded away with the breath . Eternity points in its amaranth bower , Where no clouds of fate o'er the sweet prospect lower , Unspeakable pleasure , of goodness the dower , 15 When woe fades away like the mist of the heath .</p>

    <p n="269">6 .— THE DROWNED LOVER .</p>
    <p n="270">1 . Ah ! faint are her limbs , and her footstep is weary , Yet far must the desolate wanderer roam ; Though the tempest is stern , and the mountain is dreary , She must quit at deep midnight her pitiless home . I see her swift foot dash the dew from the whortle , 5 As she rapidly hastes to the green grove of myrtle ; And I hear , as she wraps round her figure the kirtle , ‘ Stay thy boat on the lake ,— dearest Henry , I come . ’</p>
    <p n="271">2 . High swelled in her bosom the throb of affection , As lightly her form bounded over the lea , 10 And arose in her mind every dear recollection ; ‘ I come , dearest Henry , and wait but for thee . ’ How sad , when dear hope every sorrow is soothing , When sympathy 's swell the soft bosom is moving , And the mind the mild joys of affection is proving , 15 Is the stern voice of fate that bids happiness flee !</p>
    <p n="272">3 . Oh ! dark lowered the clouds on that horrible eve , And the moon dimly gleamed through the tempested air ; Oh ! how could fond visions such softness deceive ? Oh ! how could false hope rend , a bosom so fair ? 20 Thy love 's pallid corse the wild surges are laving , O'er his form the fierce swell of the tempest is raving ; But , fear not , parting spirit ; thy goodness is saving , In eternity 's bowers , a seat for thee there .</p>

    <p n="278">The energy and native genius of these Fragments must be the only apology which the Editor can make for thus intruding them on the public notice . The first I found with no title , and have left it so . It is intimately connected with the dearest interests of universal happiness ; and much as we may deplore the fatal and enthusiastic tendency which the ideas of this poor female had acquired , we cannot fail to pay the tribute of unequivocal regret to the departed memory of genius , which , had it been rightly organized , would have made that intellect , which has since become the victim of frenzy and despair , a most brilliant ornament to society .</p>
    <p n="279">In case the sale of these Fragments evinces that the public have any curiosity to be presented with a more copious collection of my unfortunate Aunt 's poems , I have other papers in my possession which shall , in that case , be subjected to their notice . It may be supposed they require much arrangement ; but I send the following to the press in the same state in which they came into my possession . J. F .</p>
    <p n="280">WAR .</p>
    <p n="281">Ambition , power , and avarice , now have hurled Death , fate , and ruin , on a bleeding world . See ! on yon heath what countless victims lie , Hark ! what loud shrieks ascend through yonder sky ; Tell then the cause , ‘ tis sure the avenger 's rage 5 Has swept these myriads from life 's crowded stage : Hark to that groan , an anguished hero dies , He shudders in death 's latest agonies ; Yet does a fleeting hectic flush his cheek , Yet does his parting breath essay to speak — 10 ‘ Oh God ! my wife , my children — Monarch thou For whose support this fainting frame lies low ; For whose support in distant lands I bleed , Let his friends ’ welfare be the warrior 's meed . He hears me not — ah ! no — kings cannot hear , 15 For passion 's voice has dulled their listless ear . To thee , then , mighty God , I lift my moan , Thou wilt not scorn a suppliant 's anguished groan . Oh ! now I die — but still is death 's fierce pain — God hears my prayer — we meet , we meet again . ’ 20 He spake , reclined him on death 's bloody bed , And with a parting groan his spirit fled . Oppressors of mankind to YOU we owe The baleful streams from whence these miseries flow ; For you how many a mother weeps her son , 25 Snatched from life 's course ere half his race was run ! For you how many a widow drops a tear , In silent anguish , on her husband 's bier ! ‘ Is it then Thine , Almighty Power , ’ she cries , ‘ Whence tears of endless sorrow dim these eyes ? 30 Is this the system which Thy powerful sway , Which else in shapeless chaos sleeping lay , Formed and approved ?— it cannot be — but oh ! Forgive me , Heaven , my brain is warped by woe . ’ ‘ Tis not — He never bade the war-note swell , 35 He never triumphed in the work of hell — Monarchs of earth ! thine is the baleful deed , Thine are the crimes for which thy subjects bleed . Ah ! when will come the sacred fated time , When man unsullied by his leaders ’ crime , 40 Despising wealth , ambition , pomp , and pride , Will stretch him fearless by his foe-men 's side ? Ah ! when will come the time , when o'er the plain No more shall death and desolation reign ? When will the sun smile on the bloodless field , 45 And the stern warrior 's arm the sickle wield ? Not whilst some King , in cold ambition 's dreams , Plans for the field of death his plodding schemes ; Not whilst for private pique the public fall , And one frail mortal 's mandate governs all . 50 Swelled with command and mad with dizzying sway ; Who sees unmoved his myriads fade away . Careless who lives or dies — so that he gains Some trivial point for which he took the pains . What then are Kings ?— I see the trembling crowd , 55 I hear their fulsome clamours echoed loud ; Their stern oppressor pleased appears awhile , But April 's sunshine is a Monarch 's smile — Kings are but dust — the last eventful day Will level all and make them lose their sway ; 60 Will dash the sceptre from the Monarch 's hand , And from the warrior 's grasp wrest the ensanguined brand . Oh ! Peace , soft Peace , art thou for ever gone , Is thy fair form indeed for ever flown ? And love and concord hast thou swept away , 65 As if incongruous with thy parted sway ? Alas , I fear thou hast , for none appear . Now o'er the palsied earth stalks giant Fear , With War , and Woe , and Terror , in his train ;— List'ning he pauses on the embattled plain , 70 Then speeding swiftly o'er the ensanguined heath , Has left the frightful work to Hell and Death . See ! gory Ruin yokes his blood-stained car , He scents the battle 's carnage from afar ; Hell and Destruction mark his mad career , 75 He tracks the rapid step of hurrying Fear ; Whilst ruined towns and smoking cities tell , That thy work , Monarch , is the work of Hell . ‘ It is thy work ! ’ I hear a voice repeat , Shakes the broad basis of thy bloodstained seat ; 80 And at the orphan 's sigh , the widow 's moan , Totters the fabric of thy guilt-stained throne — ‘ It is thy work , O Monarch ; ’ now the sound Fainter and fainter , yet is borne around , Yet to enthusiast ears the murmurs tell 85 That Heaven , indignant at the work of Hell , Will soon the cause , the hated cause remove , Which tears from earth peace , innocence , and love .</p>

    <p n="283">FRAGMENT : SUPPOSED TO BE AN EPITHALAMIUM OF FRANCIS RAVAILLAC AND CHARLOTTE CORDAY .</p>
    <p n="284">‘ Tis midnight now — athwart the murky air , Dank lurid meteors shoot a livid gleam ; From the dark storm-clouds flashes a fearful glare , It shows the bending oak , the roaring stream .</p>
    <p n="285">I pondered on the woes of lost mankind , 5 I pondered on the ceaseless rage of Kings ; My rapt soul dwelt upon the ties that bind The mazy volume of commingling things , When fell and wild misrule to man stern sorrow brings .</p>
    <p n="286">I heard a yell — it was not the knell , 10 When the blasts on the wild lake sleep , That floats on the pause of the summer gale 's swell , O'er the breast of the waveless deep .</p>
    <p n="287">I thought it had been death 's accents cold That bade me recline on the shore ; 15 I laid mine hot head on the surge-beaten mould , And thought to breathe no more .</p>
    <p n="288">But a heavenly sleep That did suddenly steep In balm my bosom 's pain , 20 Pervaded my soul , And free from control , Did mine intellect range again .</p>
    <p n="289">Methought enthroned upon a silvery cloud , Which floated mid a strange and brilliant light ; 25 My form upborne by viewless aether rode , And spurned the lessening realms of earthly night . What heavenly notes burst on my ravished ears , What beauteous spirits met my dazzled eye ! Hark ! louder swells the music of the spheres , 30 More clear the forms of speechless bliss float by , And heavenly gestures suit aethereal melody .</p>
    <p n="290">But fairer than the spirits of the air , More graceful than the Sylph of symmetry , Than the enthusiast 's fancied love more fair , 35 Were the bright forms that swept the azure sky . Enthroned in roseate light , a heavenly band Strewed flowers of bliss that never fade away ; They welcome virtue to its native land , And songs of triumph greet the joyous day 40 When endless bliss the woes of fleeting life repay .</p>
    <p n="291">Congenial minds will seek their kindred soul , E'en though the tide of time has rolled between ; They mock weak matter 's impotent control , And seek of endless life the eternal scene . 45 At death 's vain summons THIS will never die , In Nature 's chaos THIS will not decay — These are the bands which closely , warmly , tie Thy soul , O Charlotte , ‘ yond this chain of clay , To him who thine must be till time shall fade away . 50</p>
    <p n="292">Yes , Francis ! thine was the dear knife that tore A tyrant 's heart-strings from his guilty breast , Thine was the daring at a tyrant 's gore , To smile in triumph , to contemn the rest ; And thine , loved glory of thy sex ! to tear 55 From its base shrine a despot 's haughty soul , To laugh at sorrow in secure despair , To mock , with smiles , life 's lingering control , And triumph mid the griefs that round thy fate did roll .</p>
    <p n="293">Yes ! the fierce spirits of the avenging deep 60 With endless tortures goad their guilty shades . I see the lank and ghastly spectres sweep Along the burning length of yon arcades ; And I see Satan stalk athwart the plain ; He hastes along the burning soil of Hell . 65 ‘ Welcome , ye despots , to my dark domain , With maddening joy mine anguished senses swell To welcome to their home the friends I love so well . ’</p>
    <p n="294">...</p>
    <p n="295">Hark ! to those notes , how sweet , how thrilling sweet They echo to the sound of angels ’ feet . 70</p>
    <p n="296">...</p>
    <p n="297">Oh haste to the bower where roses are spread , For there is prepared thy nuptial bed . Oh haste — hark ! hark !— they 're gone .</p>
    <p n="298">...</p>
    <p n="299">CHORUS OF SPIRITS : Stay , ye days of contentment and joy , Whilst love every care is erasing , 75 Stay ye pleasures that never can cloy , And ye spirits that can never cease pleasing .</p>
    <p n="300">And if any soft passion be near , Which mortals , frail mortals , can know , Let love shed on the bosom a tear , 80 And dissolve the chill ice-drop of woe .</p>
    <p n="301">SYMPHONY .</p>
    <p n="302">FRANCIS : ‘ Soft , my dearest angel , stay , Oh ! you suck my soul away ; Suck on , suck on , I glow , I glow ! Tides of maddening passion roll , 85 And streams of rapture drown my soul . Now give me one more billing kiss , Let your lips now repeat the bliss , Endless kisses steal my breath , No life can equal such a death . ’ 90</p>
    <p n="303">CHARLOTTE : ‘ Oh ! yes I will kiss thine eyes so fair , And I will clasp thy form ; Serene is the breath of the balmy air , But I think , love , thou feelest me warm And I will recline on thy marble neck 95 Till I mingle into thee ; And I will kiss the rose on thy cheek , And thou shalt give kisses to me . For here is no morn to flout our delight , Oh ! dost thou not joy at this ? 100 And here we may lie an endless night , A long , long night of bliss . ’</p>
    <p n="304">Spirits ! when raptures move , Say what it is to love , When passion 's tear stands on the cheek , 105 When bursts the unconscious sigh ; And the tremulous lips dare not speak What is told by the soul-felt eye . But what is sweeter to revenge 's ear Than the fell tyrant 's last expiring yell ? 110 Yes ! than love 's sweetest blisses ‘ tis more dear To drink the floatings of a despot 's knell . I wake — ‘ tis done — ‘ tis over .</p>
    <p n="305">NOTE : 66 ye ] thou 1810 .</p>
    <p n="306">DESPAIR .</p>
    <p n="307">And canst thou mock mine agony , thus calm In cloudless radiance , Queen of silver night ? Can you , ye flow'rets , spread your perfumed balm Mid pearly gems of dew that shine so bright ? And you wild winds , thus can you sleep so still 5 Whilst throbs the tempest of my breast so high ? Can the fierce night-fiends rest on yonder hill , And , in the eternal mansions of the sky , Can the directors of the storm in powerless silence lie ?</p>
    <p n="308">Hark ! I hear music on the zephyr 's wing , 10 Louder it floats along the unruffled sky ; Some fairy sure has touched the viewless string — Now faint in distant air the murmurs die . Awhile it stills the tide of agony . Now — now it loftier swells — again stern woe 15 Arises with the awakening melody . Again fierce torments , such as demons know , In bitterer , feller tide , on this torn bosom flow .</p>
    <p n="309">Arise ye sightless spirits of the storm , Ye unseen minstrels of the aereal song , 20 Pour the fierce tide around this lonely form , And roll the tempest 's wildest swell along . Dart the red lightning , wing the forked flash , Pour from thy cloud-formed hills the thunder 's roar ; Arouse the whirlwind — and let ocean dash 25 In fiercest tumult on the rocking shore ,— Destroy this life or let earth 's fabric be no more .</p>
    <p n="310">Yes ! every tie that links me here is dead ; Mysterious Fate , thy mandate I obey , Since hope and peace , and joy , for aye are fled , 30 I come , terrific power , I come away . Then o'er this ruined soul let spirits of Hell , In triumph , laughing wildly , mock its pain ; And though with direst pangs mine heart-strings swell , I 'll echo back their deadly yells again , 35 Cursing the power that ne'er made aught in vain .</p>
    <p n="311">FRAGMENT .</p>
    <p n="312">Yes ! all is past — swift time has fled away , Yet its swell pauses on my sickening mind ; How long will horror nerve this frame of clay ? I 'm dead , and lingers yet my soul behind . Oh ! powerful Fate , revoke thy deadly spell , 5 And yet that may not ever , ever be , Heaven will not smile upon the work of Hell ; Ah ! no , for Heaven cannot smile on me ; Fate , envious Fate , has sealed my wayward destiny .</p>
    <p n="313">I sought the cold brink of the midnight surge , 10 I sighed beneath its wave to hide my woes , The rising tempest sung a funeral dirge , And on the blast a frightful yell arose . Wild flew the meteors o'er the maddened main , Wilder did grief athwart my bosom glare ; 15 Stilled was the unearthly howling , and a strain , Swelled mid the tumult of the battling air , ‘ Twas like a spirit 's song , but yet more soft and fair .</p>
    <p n="314">I met a maniac — like he was to me , I said — ‘ Poor victim , wherefore dost thou roam ? 20 And canst thou not contend with agony , That thus at midnight thou dost quit thine home ? ’ ‘ Ah there she sleeps : cold is her bloodless form , And I will go to slumber in her grave ; And then our ghosts , whilst raves the maddened storm , 25 Will sweep at midnight o'er the wildered wave ; Wilt thou our lowly beds with tears of pity lave ? ’</p>
    <p n="315">‘ Ah ! no , I cannot shed the pitying tear , This breast is cold , this heart can feel no more — But I can rest me on thy chilling bier , 30 Can shriek in horror to the tempest 's roar . ’</p>
    <p n="316">THE SPECTRAL HORSEMAN .</p>
    <p n="317">What was the shriek that struck Fancy 's ear As it sate on the ruins of time that is past ? Hark ! it floats on the fitful blast of the wind , And breathes to the pale moon a funeral sigh . It is the Benshie 's moan on the storm , 5 Or a shivering fiend that thirsting for sin , Seeks murder and guilt when virtue sleeps , Winged with the power of some ruthless king , And sweeps o'er the breast of the prostrate plain . It was not a fiend from the regions of Hell 10 That poured its low moan on the stillness of night : It was not a ghost of the guilty dead , Nor a yelling vampire reeking with gore ; But aye at the close of seven years ’ end , That voice is mixed with the swell of the storm , 15 And aye at the close of seven years ’ end , A shapeless shadow that sleeps on the hill Awakens and floats on the mist of the heath . It is not the shade of a murdered man , Who has rushed uncalled to the throne of his God , 20 And howls in the pause of the eddying storm . This voice is low , cold , hollow , and chill , ‘ Tis not heard by the ear , but is felt in the soul . ‘ Tis more frightful far than the death-daemon 's scream , Or the laughter of fiends when they howl o'er the corpse 25 Of a man who has sold his soul to Hell . It tells the approach of a mystic form , A white courser bears the shadowy sprite ; More thin they are than the mists of the mountain , When the clear moonlight sleeps on the waveless lake . 30 More pale HIS cheek than the snows of Nithona , When winter rides on the northern blast , And howls in the midst of the leafless wood . Yet when the fierce swell of the tempest is raving , And the whirlwinds howl in the caves of Inisfallen , 35 Still secure mid the wildest war of the sky , The phantom courser scours the waste , And his rider howls in the thunder 's roar . O'er him the fierce bolts of avenging Heaven Pause , as in fear , to strike his head . 40 The meteors of midnight recoil from his figure , Yet the ‘ wildered peasant , that oft passes by , With wonder beholds the blue flash through his form : And his voice , though faint as the sighs of the dead , The startled passenger shudders to hear , 45 More distinct than the thunder 's wildest roar . Then does the dragon , who , chained in the caverns To eternity , curses the champion of Erin , Moan and yell loud at the lone hour of midnight , And twine his vast wreaths round the forms of the daemons ; 50 Then in agony roll his death-swimming eyeballs , Though ‘ wildered by death , yet never to die ! Then he shakes from his skeleton folds the nightmares , Who , shrieking in agony , seek the couch Of some fevered wretch who courts sleep in vain ; 55 Then the tombless ghosts of the guilty dead In horror pause on the fitful gale . They float on the swell of the eddying tempest , And scared seek the caves of gigantic ... Where their thin forms pour unearthly sounds 60 On the blast that sweets the breast of the lake , And mingles its swell with the moonlight air .</p>
    <p n="318">MELODY TO A SCENE OF FORMER TIMES .</p>
    <p n="319">Art thou indeed forever gone , Forever , ever , lost to me ? Must this poor bosom beat alone , Or beat at all , if not for thee ? Ah ! why was love to mortals given , 5 To lift them to the height of Heaven , Or dash them to the depths of Hell ? Yet I do not reproach thee , dear ! Ah , no ! the agonies that swell This panting breast , this frenzied brain , 10 Might wake my — ‘ s slumb'ring tear . Oh ! Heaven is witness I did love , And Heaven does know I love thee still , Does know the fruitless sick'ning thrill , When reason 's judgement vainly strove 15 To blot thee from my memory ; But which might never , never be . Oh ! I appeal to that blest day When passion 's wildest ecstasy Was coldness to the joys I knew , 20 When every sorrow sunk away . Oh ! I had never lived before , But now those blisses are no more . And now I cease to live again , I do not blame thee , love ; ah , no ! 25 The breast that feels this anguished woe . Throbs for thy happiness alone . Two years of speechless bliss are gone , I thank thee , dearest , for the dream . ‘ Tis night — what faint and distant scream 30 Comes on the wild and fitful blast ? It moans for pleasures that are past , It moans for days that are gone by . Oh ! lagging hours , how slow you fly ! I see a dark and lengthened vale , 35 The black view closes with the tomb ; But darker is the lowering gloom That shades the intervening dale . In visioned slumber for awhile I seem again to share thy smile , 40 I seem to hang upon thy tone . Again you say , ‘ Confide in me , For I am thine , and thine alone , And thine must ever , ever be . ’ But oh ! awak'ning still anew , 45 Athwart my enanguished senses flew A fiercer , deadlier agony !</p>
