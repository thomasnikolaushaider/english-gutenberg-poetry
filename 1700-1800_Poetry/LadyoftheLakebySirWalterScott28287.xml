   <head>I . LIFE OF SCOTT</head>
    <head>I</head>
   <p>Walter Scott was born in Edinburgh , August 15 , 1771 , of an ancient Scotch clan numbering in its time many a hard rider and good fighter , and more than one of these petty chieftains , half-shepherd and half-robber , who made good the winter inroads into their stock of beeves by spring forays and cattle drives across the English Border . Scott 's great-grandfather was the famous “ Beardie ” of Harden , so called because after the exile of the Stuart sovereigns he swore never to cut his beard until they were reinstated ; and several degrees farther back he could point to a still more famous figure , “ Auld Wat of Harden , ” who with his fair dame , the “ Flower of Yarrow , ” is mentioned in The Lay of the Last Minstrel . The first member of the clan to abandon country life and take up a sedentary profession , was Scott 's father , who settled in Edinburgh as Writer to the Signet , a position corresponding in Scotland to that of attorney or solicitor in England . The character of this father , stern , scrupulous , Calvinistic , with a high sense of ceremonial dignity and a punctilious regard for the honorable conventions of life , united with the wilder ancestral strain to make Scott what he was . From “ Auld Wat ” and “ Beardie ” came his high spirit , his rugged manliness , his chivalric ideals ; from the Writer to the Signet came that power of methodical labor which made him a giant among the literary workers of his day , and that delicate sense of responsibility which gave his private life its remarkable sweetness and beauty .</p>
   <p>At the age of eighteen months , Scott was seized with a teething fever which settled in his right leg and retarded its growth to such an extent that he was slightly lame for the rest of his life . Possibly this affliction was a blessing in disguise , since it is not improbable that Scott 's love of active adventure would have led him into the army or the navy , if he had not been deterred by a bodily impediment ; in which case English history might have been a gainer , but English literature would certainly have been immeasurably a loser . In spite of his lameness , the child grew strong enough to be sent on a long visit to his grandfather 's farm at Sandyknowe ; and here , lying among the sheep on the windy downs , playing about the romantic ruins of Smailholm Tower ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>scampering through the heather on a tiny Shetland pony , or listening to stories of the thrilling past told by the old women of the farm , he drank in sensations which strengthened both the hardiness and the romanticism of his nature . A story is told of his being found in the fields during a thunder storm , clapping his hands at each flash of lightning , and shouting “ Bonny ! Bonny ! ” — a bit of infantile intrepidity which makes more acceptable a story of another sort illustrative of his mental precocity . A lady entering his mother 's room found him reading aloud a description of a shipwreck , accompanying the words with excited comments and gestures . “ There 's the mast gone , ” he cried , “ crash it goes ; they will all perish ! ” The lady entered into his agitation with tact , and on her departure , he told his mother that he liked their visitor , because “ she was a virtuoso , like himself . ” To her amused inquiry as to what a virtuoso might be , he replied : “ Do n't ye know ? why , ‘ tis one who wishes to and will know everything . ”</p>

   <p>As a boy at school in Edinburgh and in Kelso , and afterwards as a student at the University and apprentice in his father 's law office , Scott took his own way to become a “ virtuoso ” ; a rather queer way it must sometimes have seemed to his good preceptors . He refused point-blank to learn Greek , and cared little for Latin . His scholarship was so erratic that he glanced meteor-like from the head to the foot of his classes and back again , according as luck gave or withheld the question to which his highly selective memory had retained the answer . But outside of school hours he was intensely at work to “ know everything , ” so far as “ everything ” came within the bounds of his special tastes . Before he was ten years old he had begun to collect chap-books and ballads . As he grew older he read omnivorously in romance and history ; at school he learned French for the sole purpose of knowing at first hand the fascinating cycles of old French romance ; a little later he mastered Italian in order to read Dante and Ariosto , and to his schoolmaster 's indignation stoutly championed the claim of the latter poet to superiority over Homer ; a little later he acquired Spanish and read Don Quixote in the original . With such efforts , however , considerable as they were for a boy who passionately loved a “ bicker ” in the streets and who was famed among his comrades for bravery in climbing the perilous “ kittle nine stanes ” on Castle Rock , he was not content . Nothing more conclusively shows the genuineness of Scott 's romantic feeling than his willingness to undergo severe mental drudgery in pursuit of knowledge concerning the old storied days which had enthralled his imagination . It was no moonshine sentimentality which kept him hour after hour and day after day in the Advocate 's Library , poring over musty manuscripts , deciphering heraldic devices , tracing genealogies , and unraveling obscure points of Scottish history . By the time he was twenty-one he had made himself , almost unconsciously , an expert paleographer and antiquarian , whose assistance was sought by professional workers in those branches of knowledge . Carlyle has charged against Scott that he poured out his vast floods of poetry and romance without preparation or forethought ; that his production was always impromptu , and rooted in no sufficient past of acquisition . The charge cannot stand . From his earliest boyhood until his thirtieth year , when he began his brilliant career as poet and novelist , his life was one long preparation — very individual and erratic preparation , perhaps , but none the less earnest and fruitful .</p>
   <p>In 1792 , Scott , then twenty-one years old , was admitted a member of the faculty of advocates of Edinburgh . During the five years which elapsed between this date and his marriage , his life was full to overflowing of fun and adventure , rich with genial companionship , and with experience of human nature in all its wild and tame varieties . Ostensibly he was a student of law , and he did , indeed , devote some serious attention to the mastery of his profession . But the dry formalities of legal life his keen humor would not allow him to take quite seriously . On the day when he was called to the bar , while waiting his turn among the other young advocates , he turned to his friend , William Clark , who had been called with him , and whispered , mimicking the Highland lasses who used to stand at the Cross of Edinburgh to be hired for the harvest : “ We 've stood here an hour by the Tron , hinny , and deil a ane has speered<span corresp="#note2" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>our price . ” Though Scott never made a legal reputation , either as pleader at the bar or as an authority upon legal history and principles , it cannot be doubted that his experience in the Edinburgh courts was of immense benefit to him . In the first place , his study of the Scotch statutes , statutes which had taken form very gradually under the pressure of changing national conditions , gave him an insight into the politics and society of the past not otherwise to have been obtained . Of still more value , perhaps , was the association with his young companions in the profession , and daily contact with the racy personalities which traditionally haunt all courts of law , and particularly Scotch courts of law : the first association kept him from the affectation and sentimentality which is the bane of the youthful romanticist ; and the second enriched his memory with many an odd figure afterward to take its place , clothed in the colors of a great dramatic imagination , upon the stage of his stories .</p>
   <note xml:id="note2" place="bottom" n="2">Asked .</note>
   <p>Added to these experiences , there were others equally calculated to enlarge his conception of human nature . Not the least among these he found in the brilliant literary and artistic society of Edinburgh , to which his mother 's social position gave him entrance . Here , when only a lad , he met Robert Burns , then the pet and idol of the fashionable coteries of the capital . Here he heard Henry Mackenzie deliver a lecture on German literature which turned his attention to the romantic poetry of Germany and led directly to his first attempts at ballad-writing . But much more vital than any or all of these influences , were those endless walking-tours which alone or in company with a boon companion he took over the neighboring country-side — care-free , roystering expeditions , which he afterwards immortalized as Dandie Dinmont 's “ Liddesdale raids ” in Guy Mannering . Thirty miles across country as the crow flies , with no objective point and no errand , a village inn or a shepherd 's hut at night , with a crone to sing them an old ballad over the fire , or a group of hardy dalesmen to welcome them with stories and carousal — these were blithe adventurous days such as could not fail to ripen Scott 's already ardent nature , and store his memory with genial knowledge . The account of Dandie Dinmont given by Mr. Shortreed may be taken as a picture , only too true in some of its touches , of Scott in these youthful escapades : “ Eh me , ... sic an endless fund of humor and drollery as he had then wi ’ him . Never ten yards but we were either laughing or roaring and singing . Wherever we stopped how brawlie he suited himsel ’ to everybody ! He aye did as the lave did ; never made himsel ’ the great man or took ony airs in the company . I 've seen him in a ’ moods in these jaunts , grave and gay , daft and serious , sober and drunk — ( this , however , even in our wildest rambles , was but rare ) — but drunk or sober , he was aye the gentleman . He looked excessively heavy and stupid when he was fou , but he was never out o ’ gude humor . ” After this , we are not surprised to hear that Scott 's father told him disgustedly that he was better fitted to be a fiddling peddler , a “ gangrel scrape-gut , ” than a respectable attorney . As a matter of fact , however , behind the mad pranks and the occasional excesses there was a very serious purpose in all this scouring of the country-side . Scott was picking up here and there , from the old men and women with whom he hobnobbed , antiquarian material of an invaluable kind , bits of local history , immemorial traditions and superstitions , and , above all , precious ballads which had been handed down for generations among the peasantry . These ballads , thus precariously transmitted , it was Scott 's ambition to gather together and preserve , and he spared no pains or fatigue to come at any scrap of ballad literature of whose existence he had an inkling . Meanwhile , he was enriching heart and imagination for the work that was before him . So that here also , though in the hair-brained and heady way of youth , he was engaged in his task of preparation .</p>
   <p>Scott has told us that it was his reading of Don Quixote which determined him to be an author , but he was first actually excited to composition in another way . This was by hearing recited a ballad of the German poet Bürger , entitled Lenore , in which a skeleton lover carries off his bride to a wedding in the land of death . Mr. Hutton remarks upon the curiousness of the fact that a piece of “ raw supernaturalism ” like this should have appealed so strongly to a mind as healthy and sane as Scott 's . So it was , however . He could not rid himself of the fascination of the piece until he had translated it , and published it , together with another translation from the same author . One stanza at least of this first effort of Scott sounds a note characteristic of his poetry :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Tramp ! tramp ! along the land they rode ,</l>
     <l n="2">Splash ! splash ! along the sea ;</l>
     <l n="3">The scourge is red , the spur drops blood ,</l>
     <l n="4">The flashing pebbles flee .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Here we catch the trumpet-like clang and staccato tramp of verse which he was soon to use in a way to thrill his generation . This tiny pamphlet of verse , Scott 's earliest publication , appeared in 1796 . Soon after , he met Monk Lewis , then famous as a purveyor to English palates of the crude horrors which German romanticism had just ceased to revel in . Lewis was engaged in compiling a book of supernatural stories and poems under the title of Tales of Wonder , and asked Scott to contribute . Scott wrote for this book three long ballads — “ Glenfinlas , ” “ Cadyow Castle , ” and “ The Gray Brother . ” Though tainted with the conventional diction of eighteenth century verse , these ballads are not unimpressive pieces of work ; the second named , especially , shows a kind and degree of romantic imagination such as his later poetry rather substantiated than newly revealed .</p>
   <p>II</p>
   <p>In the following year , 1797 , Scott married a Miss Charpentier , daughter of a French refugee . She was not his first love , that place having been usurped by a Miss Stuart Belches , for whom Scott had felt perhaps the only deep passion of his life , and memory of whom was to come to the surface touchingly in his old age . Miss Charpentier , or Carpenter , as she was called , with her vivacity and quaint foreign speech “ caught his heart on the rebound ” ; there can be no doubt that , in spite of a certain shallowness of character , she made him a good wife , and that his affection for her deepened steadily to the end . The young couple went to live at Lasswade , a village near Edinburgh , on the Esk . Scott , in whom the proprietary instinct was always very strong , took great pride in the pretty little cottage . He made a dining-table for it with his own hands , planted saplings in the yard , and drew together two willow-trees at the gate into a kind of arch , surmounted by a cross made of two sticks . “ After I had constructed this , ” he says , “ mamma ( Mrs. Scott ) and I both of us thought it so fine that we turned out to see it by moonlight , and walked backwards from it to the cottage door , in admiration of our magnificence and its picturesque effect . ” It would have been well indeed for them both if their pleasures of proprietorship could always have remained so touchingly simple .</p>
   <p>Now that he was married , Scott was forced to look a little more sharply to his fortunes . He applied himself with more determination to the law . In 1799 he became deputy-sheriff of Selkirkshire , with a salary of three hundred pounds , which placed him at least beyond the reach of want . He began to look more and more to literature as a means of supplementing his income . His ballads in the Tales of Wonder had gained him some reputation ; this he increased in 1802 by the publication , under the title Border Minstrelsy , of the ballads which he had for several years been collecting , collating , and richly annotating . Meanwhile he was looking about for a congenial subject upon which to try his hand in a larger way than he had as yet adventured . Such a subject came to him at last in a manner calculated to enlist all his enthusiasm in its treatment , for it was given him by the Countess of Dalkeith , wife of the heir-apparent to the dukedom of Buccleugh . The ducal house of Buccleugh stood at the head of the clan Scott , and toward its representative the poet always held himself in an attitude of feudal reverence . The Duke of Buccleugh was his “ chief , ” entitled to demand from him both passive loyalty and active service ; so , at least , Scott loved to interpret their relationship , making effective in his own case a feudal sentiment which had elsewhere somewhat lapsed . He especially loved to think of himself as the bard of his clan , a modern representative of those rude poets whom the Scottish chiefs once kept as a part of their household to chant the exploits of the clan . Nothing could have pleased his fancy more , therefore , than a request on the part of the lady of his chief to treat a subject of her assigning — namely , the dark mischief-making of a dwarf or goblin who had strayed from his unearthly master and attached himself as page to a human household . The subject fell in with the poet 's reigning taste for strong supernaturalism . Gilpin Horner , the goblin page , though he proved in the sequel a difficult character to put to poetic use , was a figure grotesque and eerie enough to appeal even to Monk Lewis . At first Scott thought of treating the subject in ballad-form , but the scope of treatment was gradually enlarged by several circumstances . To begin with , he chanced upon a copy of Goethe 's Götz von Berlichingen , and the history of that robber baron suggested to him the feasibility of throwing the same vivid light upon the old Border life of his ancestors as Goethe had thrown upon that of the Rhine barons . This led him to subordinate the part played by the goblin page in the proposed story , which was now widened to include elaborate pictures of medieval life and manners , and to lay the scene in the castle of Branksome , formerly the stronghold of Scott 's and the Duke of Buccleugh 's ancestors . The verse form into which the story was thrown was due to a still more accidental circumstance , i. e ., Scott 's overhearing Sir John Stoddard recite a fragment of Coleridge 's unpublished poem “ Christabel . ” The placing of the story in the mouth of an old harper fallen upon evil days , was a happy afterthought ; besides making a beautiful framework for the main poem , it enabled the author to escape criticism for any violent innovations of style , since these could always be attributed to the rude and wild school of poetry to which the harper was supposed to belong . In these ways The Lay of the Last Minstrel gradually developed in its present form . Upon its publication in 1805 , it achieved an immediate success . The vividness of its descriptive passages , the buoyant rush of its meter , the deep romantic glow suffusing all its pages , took by storm a public familiar to weariness with the decorous abstractions of the eighteenth century poets . The first edition , a sumptuous quarto , was exhausted in a few weeks ; an octavo edition of fifteen hundred was sold out within the year ; and before 1830 , forty-four thousand copies were needed to supply the popular demand . Scott received in all something under eight hundred pounds for the Lay , a small amount when contrasted with his gains from subsequent poems , but a sum so unusual nevertheless that he determined forthwith to devote as much time to literature as he could spare from his legal duties ; those he still placed foremost , for until near the close of his life he clung to his adage that literature was “ a good staff , but a poor crutch . ”</p>
   <p>A year before the publication of the Lay , Scott had removed to the small country seat of Ashestiel , in Selkirkshire , seven miles from the nearest town , Selkirk , and several miles from any neighbor . In the introductions to the various cantos of Marmion he has given us a delightful picture of Ashestiel and its surroundings — the swift Glenkinnon dashing through the estate in a deep ravine , on its way to join the Tweed ; behind the house the rising hills beyond which lay the lovely scenery of the Yarrow . The eight years ( 1804-1812 ) at Ashestiel were the serenest , and probably the happiest , of Scott 's life . Here he wrote his two greatest poems , Marmion and The Lady of the Lake . His mornings he spent at his desk , always with a faithful hound at his feet watching the tireless hand as it threw off sheet after sheet of manuscript to make up the day 's stint . By one o'clock he was , as he said , “ his own man , ” free to spend the remaining hours of light with his children , his horses , and his dogs , or to indulge himself in his life-long passion for tree-planting . His robust and healthy nature made him excessively fond of all out-of-door sports , especially riding , in which he was daring to foolhardiness . It is a curious fact , noted by Lockhart , that many of Scott 's senses were blunt ; he could scarcely , for instance , tell one wine from another by the taste , and once sat quite unconscious at his table while his guests were manifesting extreme uneasiness over the approach of a too-long-kept haunch of venison , but his sight was unusually keen , as his hunting exploits proved . His little son once explained his father 's popularity by saying that “ it was him that commonly saw the hare sitting . ” What with hunting , fishing , salmon-spearing by torchlight , gallops over the hills into the Yarrow country , planting and transplanting of his beloved trees , Scott 's life at Ashestiel , during the hours when he was “ his own man , ” was a very full and happy one .</p>
   <p>Unfortunately , he had already embarked in an enterprise which was destined to overthrow his fortunes just when they seemed fairest . While at school in Kelso he had become intimate with a school fellow named James Ballantyne , and later , when Ballantyne set up a small printing house in Kelso , he had given him his earliest poems to print . After the issue of the Border Minstrelsy , the typographical excellence of which attracted attention even in London , he set Ballantyne up in business in Edinburgh , secretly entering the firm himself as silent partner . The good sale of the Lay had given the firm an excellent start ; but more matter was presently needed to feed the press . To supply it , Scott undertook and completed at Ashestiel four enormous tasks of editing — the complete works of Dryden and of Swift , the Somers ’ Tracts , and the Sadler State Papers . The success of these editions , and the subsequent enormous sale of Scott 's poems and novels , would have kept the concern solvent in spite of Ballantyne 's complete incapacity for business , but in 1809 Scott plunged recklessly into another and more serious venture . A dispute with Constable , the veteran publisher and bookseller , aggravated by the harsh criticism delivered upon Marmion by Francis Jeffrey , editor of the Edinburgh Review , Constable 's magazine , determined Scott to set up in connection with the Ballantyne press a rival bookselling concern , and a rival magazine , to be called the Quarterly Review . The project was a daring one , in view of Constable 's great ability and resources ; to make it foolhardy to madness Scott selected to manage the new business a brother of James Ballantyne , a dissipated little buffoon , with about as much business ability and general caliber of character as is connoted by the name which Scott coined for him , “ Rigdumfunnidos . ” The selection of such a man for such a place betrays in Scott 's eminently sane and balanced mind a curious strain of impracticality , to say the least ; indeed , we are almost constrained to feel with his harsher critics that it betrays something worse than defective judgment — defective character . His greatest failing , if failing it can be called , was pride . He could not endure even the mild dictations of a competent publisher , as is shown by his answer to a letter written by one of them proposing some salaried work ; he replied curtly that he was a “ black Hussar ” of literature , and not to be put to such tame service . Probably this haughty dislike of dictation , this imperious desire to patronize rather than be patronized , led him to choose inferior men with whom to enter into business relations . If so , he paid for the fault so dearly that it is hard for a biographer to press the issue against him .</p>
   <p>For the present , however , the wind of fortune was blowing fair , and all the storm clouds were below the horizon . In 1808 Marmion appeared , and was greeted with an enthusiasm which made the unprecedented reception of the Lay seem lukewarm in comparison . Marmion contains nothing which was not plainly foreshadowed in the Lay , but the hand of the poet has grown more sure , his descriptive effects are less crude and amateurish , the narrative proceeds with a steadier march , the music has gained in volume and in martial vigor . An anecdote is told by Mr. Hutton which will serve as a type of a hundred others illustrative of the extraordinary hold which this poetry took upon the minds of ordinary men . “ I have heard , ” he says , “ of two old men — complete strangers — passing each other on a dark London night , when one of them happened to be repeating to himself , just as Campbell did to the hackney coachman of the North Bridge of Edinburgh , the last lines of the account of Flodden Field in Marmion , ‘ Charge , Chester , charge , ’ when suddenly a reply came out of the darkness , ‘ On , Stanley , on , ’ whereupon they finished the death of Marmion between them , took off their hats to each other , and parted , laughing . ” The Lady of the Lake , which followed in little more than a year , was received with the same popular delight , and with even greater respect on the part of the critics . Even the formidable Jeffrey , who was supposed to dine off slaughtered authors as the Giant in “ Jack and the Beanstalk ” dined off young Englishmen , keyed his voice to unwonted praise . The influx of tourists into the Trossachs , where the scene of the poem was laid , was so great as seriously to embarrass the mail coaches , until at last the posting charges had to be raised in order to diminish the traffic . Far away in Spain , at a trying moment of the Peninsular campaign , Sir Adam Ferguson , posted on a point of ground exposed to the enemy 's fire , read to his men as they lay prostrate on the ground the passage from The Lady of the Lake describing the combat between Roderick Dhu 's Highlanders and the forces of the Earl of Mar ; and “ the listening soldiers only interrupted him by a joyous huzza when the French shot struck the bank close above them . ” Such tributes — and they were legion — to the power of his poetry to move adventurous and hardy men , must have been intoxicating to Scott ; there is small wonder that the success of his poems gave him , as he says , “ such a heeze as almost lifted him off his feet . ”</p>
   <p>III</p>
   <p>Scott 's modesty was not in danger , but so far as his prudence was concerned , his success did really lift him off his feet . In 1812 , still more encouraged thereto by entering upon the emoluments of the office of Clerk of Sessions , the duties of which he had performed for six years without pay , he purchased Abbotsford , an estate on the Tweed , adjoining that of the Duke of Buccleugh , his kinsman , and near the beautiful ruins of Melrose Abbey . Here he began to carry out the dream of his life , to found a territorial family which should augment the power and fame of his clan . Beginning with a modest farm house and a farm of a hundred acres , he gradually bought , planted , and built , until the farm became a manorial domain and the farm house a castle . He had not gone far in this work before he began to realize that the returns from his poetry would never suffice to meet such demands as would thus be made upon his purse . Byron 's star was in the ascendant , and before its baleful magnificence Scott 's milder and more genial light visibly paled . He was himself the first to declare , with characteristic generosity , that the younger poet had “ bet "[ 3 ] him at his own craft . As Carlyle says , “ he had held the sovereignty for some half-score of years , a comparatively long lease of it , and now the time seemed come for dethronement , for abdication . An unpleasant business ; which , however , he held himself ready , as a brave man will , to transact with composure and in silence . ”</p>
   <note xml:id="note3" place="bottom" n="3">Bested , got the better of .</note>
   <p>But , as it proved , there was no need for resignation . The reign of metrical romance , brilliant but brief , was past , or nearly so . But what of prose romance , which long ago , in picking out Don Quixote from the puzzling Spanish , he had promised himself he would one day attempt ? With some such questioning of the Fates , Scott drew from his desk the sheets of a story begun seven years before , and abandoned because of the success of The Lay of the Last Minstrel . This story he now completed , and published as Waverley in the spring of 1814 — an event “ memorable in the annals of British literature ; in the annals of British bookselling thrice and four times memorable . ” The popularity of the metrical romances dwindled to insignificance before the enthusiasm with which this prose romance was received . A moment before quietly resolved to give up his place in the world 's eye , and to live the life of an obscure country gentleman , Scott found himself launched once more on the tide of brave fortunes . The Ballantyne publishing and printing houses ceased to totter , and settled themselves on what seemed the firmest of foundations . At Abbotsford , buying , planting , and building began on a greater scale than had ever been planned in its owner 's most sanguine moments .</p>
   <p>The history of the next eleven years in Scott 's life is the history , on the one hand , of the rapidly-appearing novels , of a fame gradually spreading outward from Great Britain until it covered the civilized world — a fame increased rather than diminished by the incognito which the “ author of Waverley ” took great pains to preserve even after the secret had become an open one ; on the other hand , of the large-hearted , hospitable life at Abbotsford , where , in spite of the importunities of curious and ill-bred tourists , bent on getting a glimpse of the “ Wizard of the North , ” and in spite of the enormous mass of work , literary and official , which Scott took upon himself to perform , the atmosphere of country leisure and merriment was somehow miraculously preserved . This life of the hearty prosperous country laird was the one toward the realization of which all Scott 's efforts were directed ; it is worth while , therefore , to see as vividly as may be , what kind of life that was , that we may the better understand what kind of man he was who cared for it . The following extract from Lockhart 's Life of Scott gives us at least one very characteristic aspect of the Abbotsford world :</p>
   <p>“ It was a clear , bright September morning , with a sharpness in the air that doubled the animating influence of the sunshine ; and all was in readiness for a grand coursing-match on Newark Hill . The only guest who had chalked out other sport for himself was the staunchest of anglers , Mr. Rose ; but he , too , was there on his shelty , armed with his salmon-rod and landing-net .... This little group of Waltonians , bound for Lord Somerville 's preserve , remained lounging about , to witness the start of the main cavalcade . Sir Walter , mounted on Sibyl , was marshalling the order of procession with a huge hunting-whip ; and among a dozen frolicsome youths and maidens , who seemed disposed to laugh at all discipline , appeared , each on horseback , each as eager as the youngest sportsman in the troop , Sir Humphrey Davy , Dr. Wollaston , and the patriarch of Scottish belles-lettres , Henry Mackenzie .... Laidlow ( the steward of Abbotsford ) on a strong-tailed wiry Highlander , yclept Hoddin Grey , which carried him nimbly and stoutly , although his feet almost touched the ground , was the adjutant . But the most picturesque figure was the illustrious inventor of the safety-lamp ( Sir Humphrey Davy ) ... a brown hat with flexible brim , surrounded with line upon line of catgut , and innumerable fly-hooks ; jackboots worthy of a Dutch smuggler , and a fustian surtout dabbled with the blood of salmon , made a fine contrast with the smart jacket , white-cord breeches , and well-polished jockey-boots of the less distinguished cavaliers about him . Dr. Wollaston was in black ; and with his noble serene dignity of countenance might have passed for a sporting archbishop . Mr. Mackenzie , at this time in the seventy-sixth year of his age , with a hat turned up with green , green spectacles , green jacket , and long brown leathern gaiters buttoned upon his nether anatomy , wore a dog-whistle round his neck .... Tom Purdie ( one of Scott 's servants ) and his subalterns had preceded us by a few hours with all the grey-hounds that could be collected at Abbotsford , Darnick , and Melrose ; but the giant Maida had remained as his master 's orderly , and now gamboled about Sibyl Grey barking for mere joy like a spaniel puppy .</p>
   <p>“ The order of march had all been settled , when Scott 's daughter Anne broke from the line , screaming with laughter , and exclaimed , ‘ Papa , papa , I knew you could never think of going without your pet ! ’ Scott looked round , and I rather think there was a blush as well as a smile upon his face , when he perceived a little black pig frisking about his pony , evidently a self-elected addition to the party of the day . He tried to look stern , and cracked his whip at the creature , but was in a moment obliged to join in the general cheers . Poor piggy soon found a strap round its neck , and was dragged into the background ; Scott , watching the retreat , repeated with mock pathos , the first verse of an old pastoral song —</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">What will I do gin my hoggie die ?</l>
     <l n="2">My joy , my pride , my hoggie !</l>

     <l n="4">And wow , but I was vogie !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">— the cheers were redoubled — and the squadron moved on . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Let us supplement this with one more picture , from the same hand , showing Scott in a little more intimate light . The passage was written in 1821 , after Lockhart had married Scott 's eldest daughter , and gone to spend the summer at Chiefswood , a cottage on the Abbotsford estate :</p>
   <p>“ We were near enough Abbotsford to partake as often as we liked of its brilliant and constantly varying society ; yet could do so without being exposed to the worry and exhaustion of spirit which the daily reception of new-comers entailed upon all the family , except Scott himself . But in truth , even he was not always proof against the annoyances connected with such a style of open house-keeping .... When sore beset at home in this way , he would every now and then discover that he had some very particular business to attend to on an outlying part of his estate , and craving the indulgence of his guests overnight , appear at the cabin in the glen before its inhabitants were astir in the morning . The clatter of Sibyl Grey 's hoofs , the yelping of Mustard and Spice , and his own joyous shout of réveillée under our windows , were the signal that he had burst his toils , and meant for that day to ‘ take his ease in his inn . ’ On descending , he was found to be seated with all his dogs and ours about him , under a spreading ash that overshadowed half the bank between the cottage and the brook , pointing the edge of his woodman 's axe , and listening to Tom Purdie 's lecture touching the plantation that most needed thinning . After breakfast he would take possession of a dressing-room upstairs , and write a chapter of The Pirate ; and then , having made up and despatched his packet for Mr. Ballantyne , away to join Purdie wherever the foresters were at work ... until it was time to rejoin his own party at Abbotsford or the quiet circle of the cottage . When his guests were few and friendly , he often made them come over and meet him at Chiefswood in a body towards evening .... He was ready with all sorts of devices to supply the wants of a narrow establishment ; he used to delight particularly in sinking the wine in a well under the brae ere he went out , and hauling up the basket just before dinner was announced ,— this primitive device being , he said , what he had always practised when a young housekeeper , and in his opinion far superior in its results to any application of ice ; and in the same spirit , whenever the weather was sufficiently genial , he voted for dining out of doors altogether . ”</p>
   <p>Few events of importance except the successive appearances of “ our buiks ” as Tom Purdie called his master 's novels , and an occasional visit to London or the continent , intervened to break the busy monotony of this Abbotsford life . On one of these visits to London , Scott was invited to dine with the Prince Regent , and when the prince became King George IV , in 1820 , almost the first act of his reign was to create Scott a baronet . Scott accepted the honor gratefully , as coming , he said , “ from the original source of all honor . ” There can well be two opinions as to whether this least admirable of English kings constituted a very prime fountain of honor , judged by democratic standards ; but to Scott 's mind , such an imputation would have been next to sacrilege . The feudal bias of his mind , strong to start with , had been strengthened by his long sojourn among the visions of a feudal past ; the ideals of feudalism were living realities to him ; and he accepted knighthood from his king 's hand in exactly the same spirit which determined his attitude of humility towards his “ chief , ” the Duke of Buccleugh , and which impelled him to exhaust his genius in the effort to build up a great family estate .</p>
   <p>There were already signs that the enormous burden of work under which he seemed to move so lightly , was telling on him . The Bride of Lammermoor , The Legend of Montrose , and Ivanhoe , had all of them been dictated between screams of pain , wrung from his lips by a chronic cramp of the stomach . By the time he reached Redgauntlet and St. Ronan 's Well , there began to be heard faint murmurings of discontent from his public , hints that he was writing too fast , and that the noble wine he had poured them for so long was growing at last a trifle watery . To add to these causes of uneasiness , the commercial ventures in which he was interested drifted again into a precarious state . He had himself fallen into the bad habit of forestalling the gains from his novels by heavy drafts on his publishers , and the example thus set was followed faithfully by John Ballantyne . Scott 's good humor and his partner 's bad judgment saddled the concern with a lot of unsalable books . In 1818 the affairs of the book-selling business had to be closed up , Constable taking over the unsalable stock and assuming the outstanding liabilities in return for copyright privileges covering some of Scott 's novels . This so burdened the veteran publisher that when , in 1825 , a large London firm failed , it carried him down also — and with him James Ballantyne , with whom he had entered into close relations . Scott 's secret connection with Ballantyne had continued ; accordingly he woke up one fine day to find himself worse than beggared , being personally liable for one hundred and thirty thousand pounds .</p>
   <p>IV</p>
   <p>The years intervening between this calamity and Scott 's death form one of the saddest and at the same time most heroic chapters in the history of literature . The fragile health of Lady Scott succumbed almost immediately to the crushing blow , and she died in a few months . Scott surrendered Abbotsford to his creditors and took up humble lodgings in Edinburgh . Here , with a pride and stoical courage as quiet as it was splendid , he settled down to fill with the earnings of his pen the vast gulf of debt for which he was morally scarcely responsible at all . In three years he wrote Woodstock , three Chronicles of the Canongate , the Fair Maid of Perth , Anne of Geierstein , the first series of the Tales of a Grandfather , and a Life of Napoleon , equal to thirteen volumes of novel size , besides editing and annotating a complete edition of his own works . All these together netted his creditors £ 40 , 000 . Touched by the efforts he was making to settle their claims , they now presented him with Abbotsford , and thither he returned to spend the few years remaining to him . In 1830 he suffered a first stroke of paralysis ; refusing to give up , however , he made one more desperate rally to recapture his old power of story-telling . Count Robert of Paris and Castle Dangerous were the pathetic result ; they are not to be taken into account , in any estimate of his powers , for they are manifestly the work of a paralytic patient . The gloomy picture is darkened by an incident which illustrates strikingly one phase of Scott 's character .</p>
   <p>The great Reform Bill was being discussed throughout Scotland , menacing what were really abuses , but what Scott , with his intense conservatism , believed to be sacred and inviolable institutions . The dying man roused himself to make a stand against the abominable bill . In a speech which he made at Jedburgh , he was hissed and hooted by the crowd , and he left the town with the dastardly cry of “ Burk Sir Walter ! ” ringing in his ears .</p>
   <p>Nature now intervened to ease the intolerable strain . Scott 's anxiety concerning his debt gradually gave way to an hallucination that it had all been paid . His friends took advantage of the quietude which followed to induce him to make the journey to Italy , in the fear that the severe winter of Scotland would prove fatal . A ship of His Majesty 's fleet was put at his disposal , and he set sail for Malta . The youthful adventurousness of the man flared up again oddly for a moment , when he insisted on being set ashore upon a volcanic island in the Mediterranean which had appeared but a few days before and which sank beneath the surface shortly after . The climate of Malta at first appeared to benefit him ; but when he heard , one day , of the death of Goethe at Weimar , he seemed seized with a sudden apprehension of his own end , and insisted upon hurrying back through Europe , in order that he might look once more on Abbotsford . On the ride from Edinburgh he remained for the first two stages entirely unconscious . But as the carriage entered the valley of the Gala he opened his eyes and murmured the name of objects as they passed , “ Gala water , surely — Buckholm — Torwoodlee . ” When the towers of Abbotsford came in view , he was so filled with delight that he could scarcely be restrained from leaping out . At the gates he greeted faithful Laidlaw in a voice strong and hearty as of old : “ Why , man , how often I have thought of you ! ” and smiled and wept over the dogs who came rushing as in bygone times to lick his hand . He died a few days later , on the afternoon of a glorious autumn day , with all the windows open , so that he might catch to the last the whisper of the Tweed over its pebbles .</p>
   <p>“ And so , ” says Carlyle , “ the curtain falls ; and the strong Walter Scott is with us no more . A possession from him does remain ; widely scattered ; yet attainable ; not inconsiderable . It can be said of him , when he departed , he took a Man 's life along with him . No sounder piece of British manhood was put together in that eighteenth century of Time . Alas , his fine Scotch face , with its shaggy honesty , sagacity and goodness , when we saw it latterly on the Edinburgh streets , was all worn with care , the joy all fled from it — plowed deep with labor and sorrow . We shall never forget it ; we shall never see it again . Adieu , Sir Walter , pride of all Scotchmen , take our proud and sad farewell . ”</p>
   <p>II . SCOTT 'S PLACE IN THE ROMANTIC MOVEMENT</p>
   <p>In order rightly to appreciate the poetry of Scott it is necessary to understand something of that remarkable “ Romantic Movement ” which took place toward the end of the eighteenth century , and within a space of twenty-five years completely changed the face of English literature . Both the causes and the effects of this movement were much more than merely literary ; the “ romantic revival ” penetrated every crevice and ramification of life in those parts of Europe which it affected ; its social , political , and religious results were all deeply significant . But we must here confine ourselves to such aspects of the revival as showed themselves in English poetry .</p>
   <p>Eighteenth century poetry had been distinguished by its polish , its formal correctness , or — to use a term in much favor with critics of that day — its “ elegance . ” The various and wayward metrical effects of the Elizabethan and Jacobean poets had been discarded for a few well-recognized verse forms , which themselves in turn had become still further limited by the application to them of precise rules of structure . Hand in hand with this restricting process in meter , had gone a similar tendency in diction . The simple , concrete phrases of daily speech had given way to stately periphrases ; the rich and riotous vocabulary of earlier poetry had been replaced by one more decorous , measured , and high-sounding . A corresponding process of selection and exclusion was applied to the subject matter of poetry . Passion , lyric exaltation , delight in the concrete life of man and nature , passed out of fashion ; in their stead came social satire , criticism , generalized observation . While the classical influence , as it is usually called , was at its height , with such men as Dryden and Pope to exemplify it , it did a great work ; but toward the end of the eighth decade of the eighteenth century it had visibly run to seed . The feeble Hayley , the silly Della Crusca , the arid Erasmus Darwin , were its only exemplars . England was ripe for a literary revolution , a return to nature and to passion ; and such a revolution was not slow in coming .</p>
   <p>It announced itself first in George Crabbe , who turned to paint the life of the poor with patient realism ; in Burns , who poured out in his songs the passion of love , the passion of sorrow , the passion of conviviality ; in Blake , who tried to reach across the horizon of visible fact to mystical heavens of more enduring reality . Following close upon these men came the four poets destined to accomplish the revolution which the early comers had begun . They were born within four years of each other , Wordsworth in 1770 , Scott in 1771 , Coleridge in 1772 , Southey in 1774 . As we look at these four men now , and estimate their worth as poets , we see that Southey drops almost out of the account , and that Wordsworth and Coleridge stand , so far as the highest qualities of poetry go , far above Scott , as , indeed , Blake and Burns do also . But the contemporary judgment upon them was directly the reverse ; and Scott 's poetry exercised an influence over his age immeasurably greater than that of any of the other three . Let us attempt to discover what qualities this poetry possessed which gave it its astonishing hold upon the age when it was written . In so doing , we may discover indirectly some of the reasons why it still retains a large portion of its popularity , and perhaps arrive at some grounds of judgment by which we may test its right thereto .</p>
   <p>One reason why Scott 's poetry was immediately welcomed , while that of Wordsworth and of Coleridge lay neglected , is to be found in the fact that in the matter of diction Scott was much less revolutionary than they . By nature and education he was conservative ; he put The Lay of the Last Minstrel into the mouth of a rude harper of the North in order to shield himself from the charge of “ attempting to set up a new school in poetry , ” and he never throughout his life violated the conventions , literary or social , if he could possibly avoid doing so . This bias toward conservatism and conventionality shows itself particularly in the language of his poems . He was compelled , of course , to use much more concrete and vivid terms than the eighteenth century poets had used , because he was dealing with much more concrete and vivid matter ; but his language , nevertheless , has a prevailing stateliness , and at times an artificiality , which recommended it to readers tired of the inanities of Hayley and Mason , but unwilling to accept the startling simplicity and concreteness of diction exemplified by the Lake poets at their best .</p>
   <p>Another peculiarity of Scott 's poetry which made powerfully for its popularity , was its spirited meter . People were weary of the heroic couplet , and turned eagerly to these hurried verses , that went on their way with the sharp tramp of moss-troopers , and heated the blood like a drum . The meters of Coleridge , subtle , delicate , and poignant , had been passed by with indifference — had not been heard perhaps , for lack of ears trained to hear ; but Scott 's metrical effects were such as a child could appreciate , and a soldier could carry in his head .</p>
   <p>Analogous to this treatment of meter , though belonging to a less formal side of his art , was Scott 's treatment of nature , the landscape setting of his stories . Perhaps the most obvious feature of the romantic revival was a reawakening of interest in out-door nature . It was as if for a hundred years past people had been stricken blind as soon as they passed from the city streets into the country . A trim garden , an artfully placed country house , a well-kept preserve , they might see ; but for the great shaggy world of mountain and sea — it had been shut out of man 's elegant vision . Before Scott began to write there had been no lack of prophets of the new nature-worship , but none of them of a sort to catch the general ear . Wordsworth 's pantheism was too mystical , too delicate and intuitive , to recommend itself to any but chosen spirits ; Crabbe 's descriptions were too minute , Coleridge 's too intense , to please . Scott was the first to paint nature with a broad , free touch , without raptures or philosophizing , but with a healthy pleasure in its obvious beauties , such as appeal to average men . His “ scenery ” seldom exists for its own sake , but serves , as it should , for background and setting of his story . As his readers followed the fortunes of William of Deloraine or Roderick Dhu , they traversed by sunlight and by moonlight landscapes of wild romantic charm , and felt their beauty quite naturally , as a part of the excitement of that wild life . They felt it the more readily because of a touch of artificial stateliness in the handling , a slight theatrical heightening of effect — from an absolute point of view a defect , but highly congenial to the taste of the time . It was the scenic side of nature which Scott gave , and gave inimitably , while Burns was piercing to the inner heart of her tenderness in his lines “ To a Mountain Daisy ” and “ To a Mouse , ” while Wordsworth was mystically communing with her soul , in his “ Tintern Abbey . ” It was the scenic side of nature for which the perceptions of men were ripe ; so they left profounder poets to their musings , and followed after the poet who could give them a brilliant story set in a brilliant scene .</p>
   <p>Again , the emotional key to Scott 's poetry was on a comprehensible plane . The situations with which he deals , the passions , ambitions , satisfactions , which he portrays , belong , in one form or another , to all men , or at least are easily grasped by the imaginations of all men . It has often been said that Scott is the most Homeric of English poets ; so far as the claim rests on considerations of style , it is hardly to be granted , for nothing could be farther than the hurrying torrent of Scott 's verse from the “ long and refluent music ” of Homer . But in this other respect , that he deals in the rudimentary stuff of human character in a straightforward way , without a hint of modern complexities and super-subtleties , he is really akin to the master poet of antiquity . This , added to the crude wild life which he pictures , the vigorous sweep of his action , the sincere glow of romance which bathes his story — all so tonic in their effect upon minds long used to the stuffy decorum of didactic poetry , completed the triumph of The Lay of the Last Minstrel , Marmion , and The Lady of the Lake , over their age .</p>
   <p>As has been already suggested , Scott cannot be put in the first rank of poets . No compromise can be made on this point , because upon it the whole theory of poetry depends . Neither on the formal nor on the essential sides of his art is he among the small company of the supreme . And no one understood this better than himself . He touched the keynote of his own power , though with too great modesty , when he said , “ I am sensible that if there is anything good about my poetry ... it is a hurried frankness of composition which pleases soldiers , sailors , and young people of bold and active dispositions . ” The poet Campbell , who was so fascinated by Scott 's ballad of “ Cadyow Castle ” that he used to repeat it aloud on the North Bridge of Edinburgh until “ the whole fraternity of coachmen knew him by tongue as he passed , ” characterizes the predominant charm of Scott 's poetry as lying in a “ strong , pithy eloquence , ” which is perhaps only another name for “ hurried frankness of composition . ” If this is not the highest quality to which poetry can attain , it is a very admirable one ; and it will be a sad day for the English-speaking race when there shall not be found persons of every age and walk of life , to take the same delights in these stirring poems as their author loved to think was taken by “ soldiers , sailors , and young people of bold and active dispositions . ”</p>
   <p>III . THE LADY OF THE LAKE</p>
   <p>1 . HISTORICAL SETTING</p>
   <p>The Lady of the Lake deals with a distinct epoch in the life of King James V of Scotland , and has lying back of it a considerable amount of historical fact , an understanding of which will help in the appreciation of the poem . During his minority the King was under the tutelage of Archibald Douglas , sixth Earl of Angus , who had married the King 's mother . The young monarch chafed for a long time under this authority , but the Douglases were so powerful that he was unable to shake it off , in spite of several desperate attempts on the part of his sympathizers to rescue him . In 1528 the King , then sixteen years of age , escaped from his own castle of Falkland to Stirling Castle . The governor of Stirling , an enemy of the Douglas family , received him joyfully . There soon gathered about his standard a sufficient number of powerful peers to enable him to depose the Earl of Angus from the regency and to banish him and all his family to England . The Douglas who figures in the poem is an imaginary uncle of the banished regent , and himself under the ban , compelled to hide away in the shelter provided for him by Roderick Dhu on the lonely island in Loch Katrine . He is represented as having been loved and trusted by King James during the boyhood of the latter , before the enmity sprang up between the house of Angus and the throne . This enmity , to quote from the History of the House of Douglas , published at Edinburgh in 1743 , “ was so inveterate , that numerous as their allies were , their nearest friends , even in the most remote parts of Scotland , durst not entertain them , unless under the strictest and closest disguise . ”</p>
   <p>The outlawed border chieftain , Roderick Dhu , who gives shelter to the persecuted Douglas , is a fictitious character , but one entirely typical of the time and place . The expedition undertaken by the young King against the Border clans , under the guise of a hunting party , is in part , at least , historic . Pitscottie 's History says : “ In 1529 James V made a convention at Edinburgh for the purpose of considering the best mode of quelling the Border robbers , who , during the license of his minority and the troubles which followed , had committed many exorbitances . Accordingly , he assembled a flying army of ten thousand men , consisting of his principal nobility and their followers , who were directed to bring their hawks and dogs with them , that the monarch might refresh himself with sport during the intervals of military execution . With this array he swept through Ettrick forest , where he hanged over the gate of his own castle Piers Cockburn of Henderland , who had prepared , according to tradition , a feast for his reception . ”</p>

    <head>2 . GENERAL CRITICISM AND ANALYSIS</head>
    <head>The Lady of the Lake appeared in 1810 . Two years before , Marmion had vastly increased the popular enthusiasm aroused by The Lay of the Last Minstrel , and the success of his second long poem had so exhilarated Scott that , as he says , he “ felt equal to anything and everything . ” To one of his kinswomen , who urged him not to jeopardize his fame by another effort in the same kind , he gaily quoted the words of Montrose :</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">He either fears his fate too much</l>
     <l n="2">Or his deserts are small ,</l>
     <l n="3">Who dares not put it to the touch ,</l>
     <l n="4">To win or lose it all .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">The result justified his confidence ; for not only was The Lady of the</l>
     <l n="6">Lake as successful as its predecessors , but it remains the most</l>
     <l n="7">sterling of Scott 's poems . The somewhat cheap supernaturalism of the</l>
     <l n="8">Lay appears in it only for a moment ; both the story and the characters</l>
     <l n="9">are of a less theatrical type than in Marmion ; and it has a glow ,</l>
     <l n="10">animation , and onset , which was denied to the later poems , Rokeby and</l>
     <l n="11">The Lord of the Isles .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The following outline abridged from the excellent one given by Francis Jeffrey in the Edinburgh Review for August , 1810 , will be useful as a basis for criticism of the matter and style of the poem .</p>
   <p>“ The first canto begins with a description of a staghunt in the Highlands of Perthshire . As the chase lengthens , the sportsmen drop off ; till at last the foremost horseman is left alone ; and his horse , overcome with fatigue , stumbles and dies . The adventurer , climbing up a craggy eminence , discovers Loch Katrine spread out in evening glory before him . The huntsman winds his horn ; and sees , to his infinite surprise , a little skiff , guided by a lovely woman , glide from beneath the trees that overhang the water , and approach the shore at his feet . Upon the stranger 's approach , she pushes the shallop from the shore in alarm . After a short parley , however , she carries him to a woody island , where she leads him into a sort of silvan mansion , rudely constructed , and hung round with trophies of war and the chase . An elderly lady is introduced at supper ; and the stranger , after disclosing himself to be ‘ James Fitz-James , the knight of Snowdoun , ’ tries in vain to discover the name and history of the ladies .</p>
   <p>“ The second canto opens with a picture of the aged harper , Allan-bane , sitting on the island beach with the damsel , watching the skiff which carries the stranger back to land . A conversation ensues , from which the reader gathers that the lady is a daughter of the Douglas , who , being exiled by royal displeasure from court , had accepted this asylum from Sir Roderick Dhu , a Highland chieftain long outlawed for deeds of blood ; that this dark chief is in love with his fair protégée , but that her affections are engaged to Malcolm Graeme , a younger and more amiable mountaineer . The sound of distant music is heard on the lake ; and the barges of Sir Roderick are discovered , proceeding in triumph to the island . Ellen , hearing her father 's horn at that instant on the opposite shore , flies to meet him and Malcolm Graeme , who is received with cold and stately civility by the lord of the isle . Sir Roderick informs the Douglas that his retreat has been discovered , and that the King ( James V ) , under pretence of hunting , has assembled a large force in the neighborhood . He then proposes impetuously that they should unite their fortunes by his marriage with Ellen , and rouse the whole Western Highlands . The Douglas , intimating that his daughter has repugnances which she cannot overcome , declares that he will retire to a cave in the neighboring mountains until the issue of the King 's threat is seen . The heart of Roderick is wrung with agony at this rejection ; and when Malcolm advances to Ellen , he pushes him violently back — and a scuffle ensues , which is with difficulty appeased by the giant arm of Douglas . Malcolm then withdraws in proud resentment , plunges into the water , and swims over by moonlight to the mainland .</p>
   <p>“ The third canto opens with an account of the ceremonies employed in summoning the clan . This is accomplished by the consecration of a small wooden cross , which , with its points scorched and dipped in blood , is carried with incredible celerity through the whole territory of the chieftain . The eager fidelity with which this fatal signal is carried on , is represented with great spirit . A youth starts from the side of his father 's coffin , to bear it forward , and , having run his stage , delivers it to a young bridegroom returning from church , who instantly binds his plaid around him , and rushes onward . In the meantime Douglas and his daughter have taken refuge in the mountain cave ; and Sir Roderick , passing near their retreat on his way to the muster , hears Ellen 's voice singing her evening hymn to the Virgin . He does not obtrude on her devotions , but hurries to the place of rendezvous .</p>
   <p>“ The fourth canto begins with some ceremonies by a wild hermit of the clan , to ascertain the issue of the impending war ; and this oracle is obtained — that the party shall prevail which first sheds the blood of its adversary . The scene then shifts to the retreat of the Douglas , where the minstrel is trying to soothe Ellen in her alarm at the disappearance of her father by singing a fairy ballad to her . As the song ends , the knight of Snowdoun suddenly appears before her , declares his love , and urges her to put herself under his protection . Ellen throws herself on his generosity , confesses her attachment to Graeme , and prevails on him to seek his own safety by a speedy retreat from the territory of Roderick Dhu . Before he goes , the stranger presents her with a ring , which he says he has received from King James , with a promise to grant any boon asked by the person producing it . As he retreats , his suspicions are excited by the conduct of his guide , and confirmed by the warnings of a mad woman whom they encounter . His false guide discharges an arrow at him , which kills the maniac . The knight slays the murderer ; and learning from the expiring victim that her brain had been turned by the cruelty of Sir Roderick Dhu , he vows vengeance . When chilled with the midnight cold and exhausted with fatigue , he suddenly comes upon a chief reposing by a lonely watch-fire ; and being challenged in the name of Roderick Dhu , boldly avows himself his enemy . The clansman , however , disdains to take advantage of a worn-out wanderer ; and pledges him safe escort out of Sir Roderick 's territory , when he must answer his defiance with his sword . The stranger accepts these chivalrous terms ; and the warriors sup and sleep together . This ends the fourth canto .</p>
   <p>“ At dawn , the knight and the mountaineer proceed toward the Lowland frontier . A dispute arises concerning the character of Roderick Dhu , and the knight expresses his desire to meet in person and do vengeance upon the predatory chief . ‘ Have then thy wish ! ’ answers his guide ; and gives a loud whistle . A whole legion of armed men start up from their mountain ambush in the heath ; while the chief turns proudly and says , ‘ I am Roderick Dhu ! ’ Sir Roderick then by a signal dismisses his men to their concealment . Arrived at his frontier , the chief forces the knight to stand upon his defense . Roderick , after a hard combat is laid wounded on the ground ; Fitz-James , sounding his bugle , brings four squires to his side ; and , after giving the wounded chief into their charge , gallops rapidly on towards Stirling . As he ascends the hill to the castle , he descries approaching the same place the giant form of Douglas , who has come to deliver himself up to the King , in order to save Malcolm Graeme and Sir Roderick from the impending danger . Before entering the castle , Douglas is seized with the whim to engage in the holiday sports which are going forward outside ; he wins prize after prize , and receives his reward from the hand of the prince , who , however does not condescend to recognize his former favorite . Roused at last by an insult from one of the royal grooms , Douglas proclaims himself , and is ordered into custody by the King . At this instant a messenger arrives with tidings of an approaching battle between the clan of Roderick and the King 's lieutenant , the Earl of Mar ; and is ordered back to prevent the conflict , by announcing that both Sir Roderick and Lord Douglas are in the hands of their sovereign .</p>
   <p>“ The last canto opens in the guard room of the royal castle at Stirling , at dawn . While the mercenaries are quarreling and singing at the close of a night of debauch , the sentinels introduce Ellen and the minstrel Allan-bane — who are come in search of Douglas . Ellen awes the ruffian soldiery by her grace and liberality , and is at length conducted to a more seemly waiting place , until she may obtain audience with the King . While Allan-bane , in the cell of Sir Roderick , sings to the dying chieftain of the glorious battle which has just been waged by his clansmen against the forces of the Earl of Mar , Ellen , in another part of the palace , hears the voice of Malcolm Graeme lamenting his captivity from an adjoining turret . Before she recovers from her agitation she is startled by the appearance of Fitz-James , who comes to inform her that the court is assembled , and the King at leisure to receive her suit . He conducts her to the hall of presence , round which Ellen casts a timid and eager glance for the monarch . But all the glittering figures are uncovered , and James Fitz-James alone wears his cap and plume . The Knight of Snowdoun is the King of Scotland ! Struck with awe and terror , Ellen falls speechless at his feet , pointing to the ring which he has put upon her finger . The prince raises her with eager kindness , declares that her father is forgiven , and bids her ask for a boon for some other person . The name of Graeme trembles on her lips , but she cannot trust herself to utter it . The King , in playful vengeance , condemns Malcolm Graeme to fetters , takes a chain of gold from his own neck , and throwing it over that of the young chief , puts the clasp in the hand of Ellen . ”</p>
   <p>From this outline , it will be evident that Scott had gained greatly in narrative power since the production of The Lay of the Last Minstrel . Not only are the elements of the “ fable ” ( to use the word in its old-fashioned sense ) harmonious and probable , but the various incidents grow out of each other in a natural and necessary way . The Lay was at best a skillful bit of carpentering whereof the several parts were nicely juxtaposed ; The Lady of the Lake is an organism , and its several members partake of a common life . A few weaknesses may , it is true , be pointed out in it . The warning of Fitz-James by the mad woman 's song makes too large a draft upon our romantic credulity . Her appearance is at once so accidental and so opportune that it resembles those supernatural interventions employed by ancient tragedy to cut the knot of a difficult situation , which have given rise to the phrase deus ex machina . The improbability of the episode is further increased by the fact that she puts her warning in the form of a song . Scott 's love of romantic episode manifestly led him astray here . Further , the story as a whole shares with all stories which turn upon the revelation of a concealed identity , the disadvantage of being able to affect the reader powerfully but once , since on a second reading the element of suspense and surprise is lacking . In so far as The Lady of the Lake is a mere story , or as it has been called , a “ versified novelette , ” this is not a weakness ; but in so far as it is a poem , with the claim which poetry legitimately makes to be read and reread for its intrinsic beauty , it constitutes a real defect .</p>
   <p>Not only does this poem , with the slight exceptions just mentioned , show a gain over the earlier poems in narrative power , but it also marks an advance in character delineation . The characters of the Lay are , with one or two exceptions , mere lay-figures ; Lord Cranstoun and Margaret are the most conventional of lovers ; William of Deloraine is little more than an animated suit of armor , and the Lady of Branksome , except at one point , when from her walls she defies the English invaders , is nearly or quite featureless . With the characters of The Lady of the Lake the case is very different . The three rivals for Ellen 's hand are real men , with individualities which enhance and deepen the picturesqueness of each other by contrast . The easy grace and courtly chivalry , of the disguised King , the quick kindling of his fancy at sight of the mysterious maid of Loch Katrine , his quick generosity in relinquishing his suit when he finds that she loves another , make him one of the most life-like figures of romance . Roderick Dhu , nursing darkly his clannish hatreds , his hopeless love , and his bitter jealousy , with a delicate chivalry sending its bright thread through the tissue of his savage nature , is drawn with an equally convincing hand . Against his gloomy figure the boyish magnanimity of Malcolm Graeme , Ellen 's brave faithfulness , made human by a surface play of coquetry , and the quiet nobility of the exiled Douglas , stand out in varied relief . Judged in connection with the more conventional character types of Marmion , and with the draped automatons of the Lay , the characters of The Lady of the Lake show the gradual growth in Scott of that dramatic imagination which was later to fill the vast scene of his prose romances with unforgettable figures .</p>
   <p>But the most significant advance which this poem shows over earlier work is in the greater genuineness of the poetic effect . In the description , for example , of the approach of Roderick Dhu 's boats to the island , there is a singular depth of race feeling . There is borne in upon us , as we read , the realization of a wild and peculiar civilization ; we get a breath of poetry keen and strange , like the shrilling of the bag-pipes across the water . Again , in the speeding of the fiery cross there is a primitive depth of poetry which carries with it a sense of “ old , unhappy , far-off things ” ; it appeals to latent memories in us , which have been handed down from an ancestral past . There is nothing in either The Lay of the Last Minstrel or Marmion to compare for natural dramatic force with the situation in The Lady of the Lake when Roderick Dhu whistles for his clansmen to appear , and the astonished Fitz-James sees the lonely mountain side suddenly bristle with tartans and spears ; and the fight which follows at the ford is a real fight , in a sense not at all to be applied to the tournaments and other conventional encounters of the earlier poems . Even where Scott still clung to supernatural devices to help along his story , he handles them with much greater subtlety than he had done in his earlier efforts . The dropping of Douglas 's sword from its scabbard when his disguised enemy enters the room , arouses the imagination without burdening it . It has the same imaginative advantage over such an episode as that in the Lay , where the ghost of the wizard comes to bear off the goblin page , as suggestion always has over explicit statement . This gain in subtlety of treatment will be made still more apparent by comparing with any supernatural episode of the Lay , the account in The Lady of the Lake of the unearthly parentage of Brian the Hermit .</p>
   <p>The gain in style is less perceptible . Scott was never a great stylist ; he struck out at the very first a nervous , hurrying meter , and a strong though rather commonplace diction , upon which he never substantially improved . Abundant action , rapid transitions , stirring descriptions , common sentiments and ordinary language heightened by a dash of pomp and novelty , above all a pervading animation , spirit , intrepidity — these are the constant elements of Scott 's success , present here in their accustomed measure . In the broader sense of style , however , where the word is understood to include all the processes leading to a given poetical effect , The Lady of the Lake has some advantage , even over Marmion . It contains nothing , to be sure , so fine or so typical of Scott 's peculiar power , as the account of the Battle of Flodden in Marmion ; the minstrel 's recital of the battle of Beal ’ an Duine does not abide the comparison . The quieter parts of The Lady of the Lake , moreover , are sometimes disfigured by a sentimentality and “ prettiness ” happily unfrequent with Scott . But the description of the approach of Roderick Dhu 's war-boats , already mentioned , the superb landscape delineation in the fifth canto , and the beautiful twilight ending of canto third , can well stand as prime types of Scott 's stylistic power .</p>

      <l n="109">Then forth the noble Douglas sprung ,</l>
      <l n="110">And on his neck his daughter hung .</l>
      <l n="111">The Monarch drank , that happy hour , 775</l>
      <l n="112">The sweetest , holiest draught of Power —</l>
      <l n="113">When it can say , with godlike voice ,</l>
      <l n="114">Arise , sad Virtue , and rejoice !</l>
      <l n="115">Yet would not James the general eye</l>
      <l n="116">On Nature 's raptures long should pry ; 780</l>
      <l n="117">He stepped between — “ Nay , Douglas , nay ,</l>

      <l n="119">The riddle ‘ tis my right to read ,</l>

    <head>NOTES</head>
    <p n="1">CANTO FIRST</p>
    <p n="2">2 . = witch-elm that shades Saint Fillan 's spring .= The well or spring of St. Fillan is on the summit of a hill near Loch Earn , some miles northeast of the scene of the poem . The reason why Scott places the “ Harp of the North ” here is that St. Fillan was the favorite saint of Robert Bruce , and a relic of the saint had been borne in a shrine by a warlike abbot at the battle of Bannockburn . The word “ witch ” ( more properly spelled “ wych ” ) is connected with “ wicker ” and means “ bending , ” “ drooping . ”</p>
    <p n="3">10 . = Caledon .= Caledonia , poetic name for Scotland .</p>
    <p n="4">29 . = Monan 's rill .= Scott takes the liberty of assigning a “ rill ” to this Scottish martyr of the fourth century on his own authority , unless his editors have been at fault in failing to discover the stream indicated .</p>
    <p n="5">31 . = Glenartney 's .= Glen Artney or Valley of the Artney . The Artney is a small river northeast of the main scene of the poem .</p>
    <p n="6">33 . = Benvoirlich .= “ Ben ” is Scottish for mountain . Benvoirlich is near the western end of Glenartney .</p>
    <p n="7">53 . = Uam-Var .= A mountain between Glenartney and the Braes of Doune . The name signifies “ great den , ” and is derived from a rocky enclosure on the mountain-side , believed to have been used in primitive times as a toil or trap for deer . As told in Stanza IV a giant was fabled to have inhabited this den .</p>
    <p n="8">71 . = linn .= This word means either “ waterfall ” or “ steep ravine . ” The latter is probably the meaning here .</p>
    <p n="9">89 . = Menteith .= A village and district southeast of the line of lakes — Loch Katrine , Loch Achray , and Loch Vennachar — about which the main action of the poem moves .</p>
    <p n="10">93 . = Lochard .= Loch Ard , a small lake south of Loch Katrine . = Aberfoyle .= A village east of Loch Ard .</p>
    <p n="11">95 . = Loch-Achray .= See note on 89 .</p>
    <p n="12">97 . = Benvenue .= A mountain on the south bank of Loch Katrine .</p>
    <p n="13">103 . = Cambusmore .= An estate owned by Scott 's friends , the Buchanans , on the border of the Braes of Doune .</p>
    <p n="14">105 . = Benledi .= A majestic mountain shutting in the horizon to the north of Loch Vennachar .</p>
    <p n="15">106 . = Bochastle 's heath .= The plain between Loch Vennachar and the river Teith .</p>
    <p n="16">112 . = Brigg of Turk .= A romantic bridge , still in existence , between Loch Vennachar and Loch Achray .</p>
    <p n="17">120 . = dogs of black Saint Hubert 's breed .= A breed of dogs , usually black in color , very keen of scent and powerful in build , were kept by the abbots of St. Hubert in commemoration of their patron saint , who was a hunter .</p>
    <p n="18">138 . = whinyard .= Obsolete term for sword .</p>
    <p n="19">145 . = Trossachs .= A wild and beautiful defile between Loch Katrine and Loch Achray . The word signifies “ rough or bristled country . ”</p>
    <p n="20">166 . = Woe worth the chase .= “ Woe worth ” is an exclamation , equivalent to “ alack ! ”</p>
    <p n="21">178 . = Round and around the sounds were cast .= Notice the mimicry of the echo in the vowel sounds of the line .</p>
    <p n="22">196 . = tower ... on Shinar 's plain .= The Tower of Babel .</p>
    <p n="23">208 . = dewdrops sheen .= What part of speech is sheen ? Is this use of the word obsolete in prose ?</p>
    <p n="24">227 . = frequent flung .= “ Frequent ” is used in the original Latin sense ( Lat . frequens ) of “ crowded together , ” “ numerous . ”</p>
    <p n="25">256 . = Unless he climb , with footing nice .= Scott says : “ Until the present road was made through the romantic pass I have presumptuously attempted to describe , there was no mode of issuing out of the defile called the Trossachs , excepting by a sort of ladder , composed of the branches and roots of trees . ” What is the meaning of “ nice ” here ? What other meanings has the word had ?</p>
    <p n="26">313 . = Highland plunderers .= The clans inhabiting the region about Loch Katrine were in the habit of making incursions into the neighboring Lowlands to plunder and lay waste the country . Their warlike habits were fostered by the rugged and almost inaccessible character of the country , which prevented the Lowlanders from retaliating upon them , and enabled them also to resist the royal authority .</p>
    <p n="27">363 . = snood .= A ribbon worn by Scotch lassies and upon marriage replaced by the matron 's “ curch ” or cap . = plaid .= A rectangular shawl-like garment made of the checkered cloth called tartan .</p>
    <p n="28">438 . = couch was pulled .= Freshly pulled heather was the most luxurious bedding known to the Highlander .</p>
    <p n="29">440 . = ptarmigan and heath-cock .= These birds are a species of grouse , the one red , the other black .</p>
    <p n="30">460 . = on the visioned future bent .= The gift of second-sight was universally believed in at this period in the Highlands .</p>
    <p n="31">504 . = retreat in dangerous hour .= “ The Celtic chieftains , whose lives were continually exposed to peril , had usually , in the most retired spot of their domain , some place of retreat for the hour of necessity ... a tower , a cavern , or a rustic hut . ” ( Scott 's note in edition of 1830 . )</p>
    <p n="32">546 . = target .= What is the connection of this word with that used in archery and gun-practice ?</p>
    <p n="33">566 . = brook to wield .= “ Brook ” commonly means “ endure . ” What is its exact meaning here ?</p>
    <p n="34">573 . = Ferragus , or Ascabart .= Two giants whose names appear frequently in medieval romances of chivalry . The first is better known as Ferran , under which name he figures in the Orlando Furioso of Ariosto . Ascabart plays a part in the old English metrical romance of Sir Bevis of Hampton .</p>
    <p n="35">580 . = To whom , though more than kindred knew .= This is a very obscure expression for Scott , who is usually so careful to make himself clear . The meaning seems to be : Ellen regarded her as a mother , though that was more than the actual kinship of the two justified ( literally “ knew how to recognize ” ) .</p>
    <p n="36">591 . = Knight of Snowdoun , James Fitz-James .= As appears later in the poem , these were not his true name and title , though he was entitled to bear them .</p>
    <p n="37">622 . = a harp unseen .= In modern Scotland the bagpipe has altogether taken the place of the harp . A writer of the sixteenth century says : “ They ( the Highlanders ) take great delight to deck their harps with silver and precious stones ; the poor ones that cannot attain thereunto deck them with crystal . They sing verses prettily compounded ( i. e ., composed ) containing for the most part praises of valiant men . ”</p>
    <p n="38">638 . = pibroch .= ( Pronounced pee-brock . ) A wild tumultuous tune played on the bagpipes in the onset of battle .</p>
    <p n="39">642 . = bittern .= A wading bird , allied to the heron .</p>
    <p n="40">657 . = reveillé .= As the rhyme shows , this word is pronounced reh-vail'yah here . The common pronunciation in the United States is rev-a-lee ’ . It is the drum-beat or bugle-call at dawn to arouse soldiers .</p>
    <p n="41">CANTO SECOND</p>
    <p n="42">1 . = blackcock .= See note to I , 440 .</p>
    <p n="43">7 . = minstrel grey .= Until well on in the eighteenth century it was customary for Highland chieftains to keep in their service a bard , whose chief duty it was to sing the exploits of the ancestors of the line .</p>
    <p n="44">69 . = Lead forth his fleet .= What kind of figure is contained in the word fleet as applied to the flock of ducks ?</p>
    <p n="45">131 . = harp , which erst Saint Modan swayed .= St. Modan was not a harper , as Scott elsewhere ingenuously confesses , adding , however , that “ Saint Dunstan certainly did play upon that instrument . ”</p>
    <p n="46">141 . = Wailed loud through Bothwell 's bannered hall .= The minstrel tries to account for the strange way in which his harp gives back mournful sounds instead of the joyous ones he is trying to evoke , by calling to Ellen 's mind two other occasions when it behaved similarly . One of these was when it foreboded the death of Ellen 's mother ; the other when it foreboded the exile of the Douglasses during the minority of James V. For particulars , see the introduction on the historical setting of the poem . Bothwell Castle is on the Clyde , a few miles from Glasgow .</p>
    <p n="47">159 . = From Tweed to Spey .= The Tweed is in the extreme southern part , the Spey in the northern part , of Scotland .</p>
    <p n="48">200 . = Lady of the Bleeding Heart .= The minstrel calls Ellen so because a bleeding heart was the heraldic emblem of the Douglas family .</p>
    <p n="49">206 . = strathspey .= A dance , named from the district of Strath Spey , in the north of Scotland . It resembled the reel , but was slower .</p>
    <p n="50">213 . = Clan-Alpine 's pride .= Clan Alpine was the collective name of the followers of Roderick Dhu , who figures later in the poem as Ellen 's rejected suitor and the enemy of the mysterious “ Knight of Snowdoun ” who has just taken his departure from the island .</p>
    <p n="51">216 . = Lennox foray .= Lennox is the district south of Menteith , in the Lowlands . It was the scene of innumerable forays and “ cattle-drives . ”</p>
    <p n="52">221 . = In Holy-Rood a knight he slew .= Holyrood is the royal castle at Edinburgh , where the court usually was held . It was deemed a heinous and desperate offense to commit an act of blood in the royal residence or its immediate neighborhood , since such an act was an indirect violation of the majesty of the king , and a breaking of “ the king 's peace . ” It was for this offense that Roderick Dhu was exiled , and compelled to live like an outlaw in his mountain fastness .</p>
    <p n="53">227 . = Who else dared give .= Notice how skilfully Scott manages to give us the relations of the chief characters of the poem to each other , and to show that Ellen 's father , pursued by the hatred of James V , has been given the island shelter in Loch Katrine by Roderick Dhu who is about to make his appearance in the story .</p>
    <p n="54">236 . = Full soon may dispensation sought .= A papal dispensation was necessary , because Ellen and Roderick Dhu were cousins . See next note .</p>
    <p n="55">249 . = All that a mother could bestow .= Here again the poet takes the indirect way of making clear his point , namely that the matron introduced in the first canto is the mother of Roderick Dhu . The phrase “ an orphan in the wild , ” is in apposition with the following phrase “ her sister 's child ” — i. e ., Ellen herself . From this it appears that Lady Margaret is Ellen 's aunt , and that Roderick Dhu is , therefore , Ellen 's cousin .</p>
    <p n="56">260 . = Maronnan 's cell .= A chapel at the eastern extremity of Loch Lomond , dedicated to the rather obscure saint here named .</p>
    <p n="57">270 . = Bracklinn 's thundering wave .= The reference is to a cascade made by a mountain torrent at the Bridge of Bracklinn , near the village of Callender in Menteith . Notice how Scott 's numerous references to places in the region where the poem is laid tend gradually to give us an idea of the richness and diversity of the landscape .</p>
    <p n="58">274 . = claymore .= A large two-handed sword .</p>
    <p n="59">305 . = Thy father 's battle-brand .= Some swords , especially those which had been magically forged , were held to possess the property of drawing themselves from their scabbard at the approach of their owner 's deadly enemy . This is the first vague hint which Scott gives us as to the real identity of the “ Knight of Snowdoun . ” To throw a further glamor of romance about the prophetical weapon , he tells us that it was given by fairies to an ancestor of its present owner , namely , to Archibald , third Duke of Angus , called Tine-man ( Loseman ) because he always lost his men in battle , and that this gift was made while Archibald was in league with Harry Hotspur .</p>
    <p n="60">319 . = Beltane game .= The sports of May Day .</p>
    <p n="61">327 . = canna .= Cotton grass .</p>
    <p n="62">Stanza XVI . In this and the two following stanzas notice how skillfully description and narrative are woven together , and how the picture gains in detail and distinctness as the boats approach .</p>
    <p n="63">334 . = barges .= What change has occurred in the use of this word ?</p>
    <p n="64">335 . = Glengyle ... Brianchoil .= Why does the poet introduce these proper names ? Are they of any value as information ?</p>
    <p n="65">343 . = tartans .= See note to I , xix , 363 .</p>
    <p n="66">395 . = The chorus first could Allan know .= The chorus was the first part of the song which the harper , listening from the shore , could distinctly make out .</p>
    <p n="67">408 . = Roderigh Vich Alpine dhu .= The words vich and dhu are Gaelic , the first meaning “ descendant of , ” the second “ black or swarthy . ” King Alpine was the half-mythical ancestor from whom the clan of Alpine sprung . The line means , therefore , “ Black Roderick , descendant of Alpine . ” Compare II , xii , 220 , where Allan-bane calls the chieftain “ Black Sir Roderick . ”</p>
    <p n="68">410 . = Blooming at Beltane .= See note to II , 319 .</p>
    <p n="69">416 . = Breadalbane .= A large district in the western part of the county of Perth .</p>
    <p n="70">419-426 . = Glen Fruin , Bannochar , Glenn Luss , Ross-dhu , Leven-glen .= What , in simple language , should you say was the value of this array of obscure names in the song ?</p>
    <p n="71">431 . = the rose-bud that graces yon islands .= To whom do the singers metaphorically refer ?</p>
    <p n="72">497 . = Percy 's Norman pennon .= Captured by the Douglas in the raid which led to the battle of Otterburn , as celebrated in the old ballad of Chevy Chase . ( Sprague . )</p>
    <p n="73">504 . = The waned crescent .= This may be taken as referring to some victory over the Turkish armies in the East , or to the defeat of Scott 's ancestor , Sir Walter Scott of Buccleugh , who was defeated in an attempt to set the young king free from the Douglas . The shield of Sir Walter bore a crescent moon .</p>
    <p n="74">506 . = Blantyre .= A priory on the banks of the Clyde near Bothwell castle , of which ruins still remain .</p>
    <p n="75">574 . = Glenfinlas .= A valley to the northeast of Loch Katrine , between Ben-An and Ben-Ledi .</p>
    <p n="76">577 . = royal ward .= Malcolm , as a minor , was still under the king 's guardianship .</p>
    <p n="77">583 . = Strath-Endrick glen .= A valley on the southeast of Loch Lomond , presumably Malcolm 's home .</p>
    <p n="78">623-625 . = The Meggat =, the = Yarrow =, and the = Ettrick = are successive tributaries , the waters of which eventually reach the Tweed . The Teviot is also a tributary of the Tweed . All five rivers are in the southern part of Scotland .</p>
    <p n="79">678 . = Links of Forth .= Banks of the river Forth . In general the word “ links ” means flat or undulating stretches of sandy soil , partially covered with grass or heather .</p>
    <p n="80">692 . = There are who have .= How does this differ from the prose idiom ?</p>
    <p n="81">801 . = pity ‘ twere such cheek should feel the midnight air .= Was there anything in the Highland character and training which would make these words seem particularly cutting ? Notice how the insult is deepened later by the assumption on Rhoderick Dhu 's part that Malcolm is capable of treachery toward Douglas and the Clan of Alpine .</p>
    <p n="82">809 . = henchman .= This word is said to have been originally “ haunch-man ” because it was the duty of this retainer to stand beside his master 's chair ( at his haunches as it were ) at the feast , in readiness to do his bidding or to defend him if attacked .</p>
    <p n="83">831 . = Fiery Cross .= The signal for the gathering of the clan to war . The preparation and carrying abroad of this cross is described in the next canto .</p>
    <p n="84">CANTO THIRD</p>
    <p n="85">39 . = cushat dove .= Better known as the ringdove .</p>
    <p n="86">63 . = shivers .= “ Slivers ” is the more common word , but the verb “ to shiver , ” meaning to break in pieces , keeps the original meaning .</p>
    <p n="87">74 . = Benharrow .= This mountain is near the north end of Loch Lomond .</p>
    <p n="88">87 . = strath .= A wide open valley , distinguished from a glen , which is narrow .</p>
    <p n="89">104 . = fieldfare .= A species of thrush .</p>
    <p n="90">116 . = virgin snood .= See note to I , 363 .</p>
    <p n="91">154 . = River Demon .= Concerning this creature Scott gives the current observation : “ The River Demon , or River-horse , is an evil spirit , delighting to forebode and witness calamity .

    <p n="275">CLASSES OF POETRY</p>
    <p n="276">It is important for the student of poetry to know the principal classes into which poems are divided . The following brief explanations do not pretend to be exhaustive , but they should be of practical aid . It must be remembered that a long poem is sometimes not very definitely of any one class , but combines characteristics of different classes .</p>
    <p n="277">Narrative poetry , like narrative prose , aims primarily to tell a story .</p>
    <p n="278">The epic is the most pretentious kind of narrative poetry ; it tells in serious verse of the great deeds of a popular hero . The Iliad , the Aeneid , Beowulf , Paradise Lost are important epics . The Idylls of the King is in the main an epic poem .</p>
    <p n="279">The metrical romance is a rather long story in verse , of a less exalted and heroic character than the true epic . Scott 's Lady of the Lake is a familiar example .</p>
    <p n="280">The verse tale is shorter and likely to be less dignified and serious than the metrical romance . The stories in Chaucer 's Canterbury Tales , or Burns 's Tam O'Shanter , may serve as examples .</p>
    <p n="281">The ballad is a narrative poem , usually rather short and in such form as to be sung . It is distinguished from a song by the fact that it tells a story . Popular or folk ballads are ancient and of unknown authorship — handed down by word of mouth and varied by the transmitters . Artistic ballads are imitations , by known poets , of traditional ballads .</p>
