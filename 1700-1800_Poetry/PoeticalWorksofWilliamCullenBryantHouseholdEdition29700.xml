    <docTitle><titlePart>WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT . The ancestry of William Cullen Bryant might have been inferred from the character of his writings , which reflect whatever is best and noblest in the life and thought of New England . It was a tradition that the first Bryant of whom there is any account in the annals of the New World came over in the Mayflower , but the tradition is not authenticated . What is known of this gentleman , Mr. Stephen Bryant , is that he came over from England , and that he was at Plymouth , Massachusetts , as early as 1632 . He married Abigail Shaw , who had emigrated with her father , and who bore him several children between 1650 and 1665 , it is to be presumed at Plymouth , of which town he was chosen constable in 1663 . Stephen Bryant had a son named Ichabod , who was the father of Philip Bryant , who was born in 1732 . Philip Bryant married Silence Howard , the daughter of Dr. Abiel Howard , of West Bridgewater , whose profession he adopted , being a practitioner in medicine in North Bridgewater . He was the father of nine children , one of whom , Peter Bryant , born in 1767 , succeeded him in his profession . Young Dr. Bryant became enamored of Miss Sarah Snell , the daughter of Mr. Ebenezer Snell , of Bridgewater , who removed his family to Cummington , whither he was followed by his future son-in-law , who married the lady of his love in 1792 . Two years later , on the 3d of November , there was born to him a man-child , who was to win , and to leave ,</titlePart></docTitle>

    <docTitle><titlePart>Dr. Bryant was proud of his profession ; and in the hope , no doubt , that his son would become a shining light therein , he perpetuated at his christening the name of a great medical authority , who had departed this life four years before — William Cullen . Dr. Bryant was the last of his family to practise the healing art ; for Nature , wiser than he , early determined the future course of Master William Cullen Bryant . He was not to be a doctor , but a poet . A poet , that is , if he lived to be anything ; for the chances were against his living at all . The lad was exceedingly frail , and had a head the immensity of which troubled his anxious father . How to reduce it to the normal size was a puzzle which Dr. Bryant solved in a spring of clear , cold water , which burst out of the ground on or near his homestead , and into which the child was immersed every morning , head and all , by two of Dr. Bryant 's students — kicking lustily , we may be sure , at this matutinal dose of hydropathy . William Cullen Bryant came of Mayflower stock , his mother being a descendant of John Alden ; and the characteristics of his family included some of the sterner qualities of the Puritans . Grandfather Snell was a magistrate , and , without doubt a severe one , for the period was not one which favored leniency to criminals . The whipping-post was still extant in Massachusetts , and the poet remembered that it stood about a mile from his early home at Cummington , and that he once saw a young fellow of eighteen who had received forty lashes as a punishment for a theft he had committed . It was , he thought , the last example of corporal punishment inflicted by law in that neighborhood , though the whipping-post remained in its place for several years , a possible terror to future evildoers . “ Spare the rod , spoil the child , ” was the Draconian code then ; and the rod , in the shape of a little bundle of birchen twigs , bound together with a small cord , was generally suspended on a nail against the wall in the kitchen , and was as much a part of the necessary furniture as the crane that hung in the fireplace or the shovel and tongs . Magistrate Snell was a disciplinarian of the stricter sort ; and as he and his wife resided with Dr. Bryant and his family , the latter stood in awe of him , so much so that young William Cullen was prevented from feeling anything like affection for him . It was an age of repression , not to say oppression , for children , who had few rights that their elders were bound to respect . To the terrors of the secular arm were added the deeper terrors of the spiritual law , for the people of that primitive period were nothing if not religious . The minister was the great man , and his bodily presence was a restraint upon the unruly , and the ruly too , for that matter . The lines of our ancestors did not fall in pleasant places as far as recreations were concerned ; for they were few and far between , consisting , for the most part , of militia musters , “ raisings , ” corn-huskings , and singing-schools , diversified with the making of maple sugar and cider . Education was confined to the three R 's , though the children of wealthy parents were sent to colleges as they now are . It was not a genial social condition , it must be confessed , to which William Cullen Bryant was born , though it might have been worse but for his good father , who was in many respects superior to his rustic neighbors . A broad-shouldered , muscular gentleman , proud of his strength , his manners were gentle and reserved , his disposition was serene , and he was fond of society . He was not without political distinction , for he was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives for several terms , and afterward to the State Senate , and he associated with the cultivated circles of Boston both as a legislator and a physician . William Cullen Bryant was fortunate in his father , who , if he was disappointed when he found that his son was born to be a follower of Apollo and not of Æsculapius , kept his disappointment to himself , and encouraged the lad in his poetical attempts . We have the authority of the poet himself that his father taught his youth the art of verse , and that he offered him to the Muses in the bud of life . His first efforts were several clever “ Enigmas , ” in imitation of the Latin writers , a translation from Horace , and a copy of verses which were written in his twelfth year , to be recited at the close of the winter school , “ in the presence of the Master , the Minister of the parish , and a number of private gentlemen . ” They were printed on the 18th of March , 1807 , in the Hampshire Gazette , from which these particulars are derived , and which was favored with other contributions from the pen of “ C. B . ” The juvenile poems of William Cullen Bryant are as clever as those of Chatterton , Pope , and Cowley ; but they are in no sense original , and it would have been strange if they had been . There was no original writing in America at the time they were written ; and if there had been , it would hardly have commended itself to the old-fashioned taste of Dr. Bryant , to whom Pope was still a power in poetry , as Addison , no doubt , was in prose . It was natural , therefore , that he should offer his boy to the strait-laced Muses of Queen Anne 's time ; that the precocious boy should lisp in heroic couplets , and that he should endeavor to be satirical . Politics were running high in the first decade of the present century , and the favorite bug-bear in New England was President Jefferson , who in 1807 had laid an embargo on American shipping , in consequence of the decrees of Napoleon , and the British orders in council in relation thereto . This act was denounced , and by no one more warmly than by Master Bryant , who made it the subject of a satire , which was published in Boston in 1808 . It was entitled “ The Embargo ; or , Sketches of the Times , ” and was printed for the purchasers , who were found in sufficient numbers to exhaust the first edition . It is said to have been well received , but doubts were expressed as to whether the author was really a youth of thirteen . His friends came to his rescue in an “ Advertisement , ” which was prefixed to a second edition of his little brochure , published in the following year , and certified to his age from their personal knowledge of himself and his family . They also certified to his extraordinary talents , though they should prefer to have him judged by his works , without favor or affection . They concluded by stating that the printer was authorized to disclose their names and places of residence . The early poetical exercises of William Cullen Bryant , like those of all young poets , were colored by the books which he read . Among these were the works of Pope , as I have already intimated , and , no doubt , the works of Cowper and Thomson . The latter , if they were in the library of Dr. Bryant , do not appear to have impressed his son at this time ; nor , indeed , does any English poet except Pope , so far as we can judge from his contributions to the Hampshire Gazette , which were continued from time to time . They were bookish and patriotic ; one , which was written at Cummington on the 8th of January , 1810 , being “ The Genius of Columbia ; ” and another , “ An Ode for the Fourth of July , 1812 , ” to the tune of “ Ye Gentlemen of England . ” These productions are undeniably clever , but they are not characteristic of their writer , nor of the nature which surrounded his birthplace , with which he was familiar , and of which he was a close observer , as his poetry was soon to disclose .</titlePart></docTitle>

  <body>
   <p>He entered Williams College , in Williamstown , Mass ., in his sixteenth year , and remained there until 1812 , distinguishing himself for aptness and industry in classical learning and polite literature . At the end of two years he withdrew , and commenced the study of law , first with Judge Howe , of Worthington , and afterward with Mr. William Baylies , of Bridgewater . So far he had written nothing but clever amateur verse ; but now , in his eighteenth year , he wrote an imperishable poem . The circumstances under which it was composed have been variously stated , but they agree in the main particulars , and are thus given in “ The Bryant Homestead Book ” ( 1870 ) , apparently on authentic information : “ It was here at Cummington , while wandering in the primeval forests , over the floor of which were scattered the gigantic trunks of fallen trees , mouldering for long years , and suggesting an indefinitely remote antiquity , and where silent rivulets crept along through the carpet of dead leaves , the spoil of thousands of summers , that the poem entitled ‘ Thanatopsis ’ was composed . The young poet had read the poems of Kirke White , which , edited by Southey , were published about that time , and a small volume of Southey 's miscellaneous poems ; and some lines of those authors had kindled his imagination , which , going forth over the face of the inhabitants of the globe , sought to bring under one broad and comprehensive view the destinies of the human race in the present life , and the perpetual rising and passing away of generation after generation who are nourished by the fruits of its soil , and find a resting-place in its bosom . ” We should like to know what lines in Southey and Kirke White suggested “ Thanatopsis , ” that they might be printed in letters of gold hereafter .</p>
   <p>When the young poet quitted Cummington to begin his law studies , he left the manuscript of this incomparable poem among his papers in the house of his father , who found it after his departure . “ Here are some lines that our William has been writing , ” he said to a lady to whom he showed them . She read them , and , raising her eyes to the face of Dr. Bryant , burst into tears — a tribute to the genius of his son in which he was not ashamed to join . Blackstone bade his Muse a long adieu before he turned to wrangling courts and stubborn law ; and our young lawyer intended to do the same ( for poetry was starvation in America seventy years ago ) , but habit and nature were too strong for him . There is no difficulty in tracing the succession of his poems , and in a few instances the places where they were written , or with which they concerned themselves . “ Thanatopsis , ” for example , was followed by “ The Yellow Violet , ” which was followed by the “ Inscription for the Entrance to a Wood , ” and the song beginning “ Soon as the glazed and gleaming snow . ” The exquisite lines “ To a Waterfowl ” were written at Bridgewater , in his twentieth year , where he was still pursuing the study of law , which appears to have been distasteful to him . The concluding stanza sank deeply into a heart that needed its pious lesson :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ He who , from zone to zone ,</l>
     <l n="2">Guides through the boundless sky thy certain flight ,</l>
     <l n="3">In the long way that I must tread alone ,</l>
     <l n="4">Will lead my steps aright . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The lawyer-poet had a long way before him , but he did not tread it alone ; for , after being admitted to the bar in Plymouth , and practising for a time in Plainfield , near Cummington , he removed to Great Barrington , in Berkshire , where he saw the dwelling of the Genevieve of his chilly little “ Song , ” his Genevieve being Miss Frances Fairchild of that beautiful town , whom he married in his twenty-seventh year , and who was the light of his household for nearly half a century . It was to her , the reader may like to know , that he addressed the ideal poem beginning “ O fairest of the rural maids ” ( circa 1825 ) , “ The Future Life ” ( 1837 ) , and “ The Life that Is ” ( 1858 ) ; and her memory and her loss are tenderly embalmed in one of the most touching of his later poems , “ October , 1866 . ”</p>
   <p>“ Thanatopsis ” was sent to the North American Review ( whether by its author or his father we are not told ) , and with such a modest , not to say enigmatical , note of introduction , that its authorship was left in doubt . The Review was managed by a club of young literary gentlemen , who styled themselves “ The North American Club , ” two of whose members , Mr. Richard Henry Dana and Mr. Edward Tyrrel Channing , were considered its editors . Mr. Dana read the poem carefully , and was so surprised at its excellence that he doubted whether it was the production of an American , an opinion in which his associates are understood to have concurred . While they were hesitating about its acceptance , he was told that the writer was a member of the Massachusetts Senate ; and , the Senate being then in session , he started immediately from Cambridge for Boston . He reached the State House , and inquired for Senator Bryant . A tall , middle-aged man , with a business-like look , was pointed out to him . He was satisfied that he could not be the poet he sought , so he posted back to Cambridge without an introduction . The story ends here , and rather tamely ; for the original narrator forgot , or perhaps never knew , that Dr. Bryant was a member of the Senate , and that it was among the possibilities that he was the Senator with a similar name . American poetry may be said to have commenced in 1817 with the September number of the North American Review , which contained “ Thanatopsis ” and the “ Inscription for the Entrance of a Wood , ” the last being printed as a “ Fragment . ” Six months later , in March , 1818 , the impression which “ Thanatopsis ” created was strengthened by the appearance of the lines “ To a Waterfowl , ” and the “ Version of a Fragment of Simonides . ”</p>
   <p>Mr. Bryant 's literary life may now be said to have begun , though he depended upon the practice of his profession for his daily bread . He continued his contributions to the North American Review in the shape of prose papers on literary topics , and maintained the most friendly relations with its conductors ; notably so with Mr. Dana , who was seven years his elder , and who possessed , like himself , the accomplishment of verse . At the suggestion of this poetical and critical brother , he was invited to deliver a poem before the Phi Beta Kappa Society at Harvard College — an honor which is offered only to those who have already made a reputation , and are likely to reflect credit on the Society as well as on themselves . He accepted , and in 1821 wrote his first poem of any length , “ The Ages , ” which still remains the best poem of the kind that was ever recited before a college society either in this country or in England ; grave , stately , thoughtful , presenting in animated , picturesque stanzas a compact summary of the history of mankind . A young Englishman of twenty-one — Thomas Babington Macaulay — delivered in the same year a poem on “ Evening , ” before the students of Trinity College , Cambridge ; and it is instructive to compare his conventional heroics with the spirited Spenserian stanzas of William Cullen Bryant .</p>
   <p>The lines “ To a Waterfowl , ” which were written at Bridgewater in 1815 , were followed by “ Green River , ” “ A Winter Piece , ” “ The West Wind , ” “ The Burial-Place , ” “ Blessed are they that mourn , ” “ No man knoweth his Sepulchre , ” “ A Walk at Sunset , ” and “ The Hymn to Death . ”</p>
   <p>These poems , which cover a period of six busy years , are interesting to the poetic student as examples of the different styles of their writer , and of the changing elements of his thoughts and feelings . “ Green River , ” for example , is a momentary revealment of his shy temperament and his daily pursuits . Its glimpses of nature are charming , and his wish to be beside its waters is the most natural one in the world . The young lawyer is not complimentary to his clients , whom he styles “ the dregs of men , ” while his pen , which does its best to serve them , becomes “ a barbarous pen . ” He is dejected , but a visit to the river will restore his spirits ; for , as he gazes upon its lonely and lovely stream ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ An image of that calm life appears</l>
     <l n="2">That won my heart in my greener years . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ A Winter Piece ” is a gallery of woodland pictures which anything of the kind in the language . “ A Walk at Sunset ” is notable in that it is the first poem in which we see ( faintly , it must be confessed ) the aboriginal element , which was soon to become a prominent one in Mr. Bryant 's poetry . It was inseparable from the primeval forests of the New World , but he was the first to perceive its poetic value . The “ Hymn to Death ” — stately , majestic , consolatory — concludes with a touching tribute to the worth of his good father , who died while he was writing it , at the age of fifty-four . The year 1821 was an important one to Mr. Bryant , for it witnessed the publication of his first collection of verse , his marriage , and the death of his father .</p>
   <p>The next four years of Mr. Bryant 's life were more productive than any that had preceded them , for he wrote upward of thirty poems during that time . The aboriginal element was creative in “ The Indian Girl 's Lament , ” “ An Indian Story , ” “ An Indian at the Burial-Place of his Fathers , ” and , noblest of all , “ Monument Mountain ; ” the Hellenic element predominated in “ The Massacre at Scio ” and “ The Song of the Greek Amazon ; ” the Hebraic element touched him lightly in “ Rizpah ” and the “ Song of the Stars ; ” and the pure poetic element was manifest in “ March , ” “ The Rivulet ” ( which , by the way , ran through the grounds of the old homestead at Cummington ) , “ After a Tempest , ” “ The Murdered Traveler , ” “ Hymn to the North Star , ” “ A Forest Hymn , ” “ O fairest of the rural maids , ” and the exquisite and now most pathetic poem , “ June . ” These poems and others not specified here , if read continuously and in the order in which they were composed , show a wide range of sympathies , a perfect acquaintance with many measures , and a clear , capacious , ever-growing intellect . They are all distinctive of the genius of their author , but neither exhibits the full measure of his powers . We can say of none of them , “ The man who wrote this will never write any better . ”</p>
   <p>The publication of Mr. Bryant 's little volume of verse was indirectly the cause of his adopting literature as a profession . It was warmly commended , and by no one more so than by Mr. Gulian C. Verplanck , in the columns of the New York American . He was something of a literary authority at the time , a man of fortune and college-bred , known in a mild way as the author of an anniversary discourse delivered before the New York Historical Society in 1818 , of a political satire entitled “ The Bucktail Bards , ” and later of an “ Essay on the Doctrine of Contracts . ” Among his friends was Mr. Henry D. Sedgwick , a summer neighbor , so to speak , of Mr. Bryant 's , having a country-house at Stockbridge , a few miles from Great Barrington , and a house in town , which was frequented by the literati of the day , such as Verplanck , Halleck , Percival , Cooper , and others of less note . An admirer of Mr. Bryant , Mr. Sedgwick set to work , with the assistance of Mr. Verplanck , to procure him literary employment in New York , in order to enable him to escape his hated bondage to the law ; and he was appointed assistant editor of a projected periodical called the New York Review and Athenæum Magazine . The at last enfranchised lawyer dropped his barbarous pen , closed his law-books , and in the winter or spring of 1825 removed with his household to New York . The projected periodical was started , as these sanguine ventures always are , with fair hopes of success . It was well edited , and its contributors were men of acknowledged ability . The June number contained two poems which ought to have made a great hit . One was “ A Song of Pitcairn 's Island ; ” the other was “ Marco Bozzaris . ” There was no flourish of trumpets over them , as there would be now ; the writers merely prefixed their initials , “ B . ” and “ H . ” The reading public of New York were not ready for the Review , which had been projected for their mental enlightenment ; so , after about a year 's struggle , it was merged in the New York Literary Gazette , which began its mission about four years before . This magazine shared the fate of its companion in a few months , when it was consolidated with the United States Literary Gazette , which in two months was swallowed up in the United States Review . The honor of publishing and finishing the last was shared by Boston and New York . Profit in these publications there was none , though Bryant , Halleck , Willis , Dana , Bancroft , and Longfellow wrote for them . Too good , or not good enough , they lived and died prematurely . Mr. Bryant 's success as a metropolitan man of letters was not brilliant so far ; but there were other walks than those of pure literature open to him , as to others , and into one of the most bustling of these he entered in his thirty-second year . In other words , he became one of the editors of the Evening Post . Henceforth he was to live by journalism .</p>
   <p>Journalism , though an exacting pursuit , leaves its skillful followers a little leisure in which to cultivate literature . It the heyday of those ephemeral trifles , Annuals , and Mr. Bryant found time to edit one , with the assistance of his friend Mr. Verplanck , and his acquaintance Mr. Robert C. Sands ( who , by the way , was one of the editors of the Commercial Advertiser ) , and a very creditable work it was . His contributions to “ The Talisman ” included some of his best poems . Poetry was the natural expression of his genius — a fact which he could never understand , for it always seemed to him that prose was the natural expression of all mankind . His prose was , and always continued to be , masterly . Its earliest examples , outside of his critical papers in the North American Review and other periodicals ( and outside of the Evening Post , of course ) , are two stories entitled “ Medfield ” and “ The Skeleton 's Cave , ” contributed by him to “ Tales of the Glauber Spa ” ( 1832 ) — a collection of original stories by Mr. James K. Paulding , Mr. Verplanck , Mr. Sands , Mr. William Leggett , and Miss Catharine Sedgwick . Three years before ( 1828 ) he had become the chief editor of the Evening Post . Associated with him was Mr. Leggett , who had shown some talent as a writer of sketches and stories , and who had failed , like himself , in conducting a critical publication , for which his countrymen were not ready . He made a second collection of his poems at this time ( 1832 ) , a copy of which was sent by Mr. Verplanck to Mr. Washington Irving , who was then , what he had been for years , the idol of English readers , and not without weight with the Trade . Would he see if some English house would not reprint it ? No leading publisher nibbled at it , not even Murray , who was Mr. Irving 's publisher ; but an obscure bookseller named Andrews finally agreed to undertake it , if Mr. Irving would put his valuable name on the title-page as the editor . He was not acquainted with Mr. Bryant , but he was a kind-hearted , large-souled gentleman , who knew good poetry when he saw it , and he consented to “ edit ” the book . He was not a success in the estimation of Andrews , who came to him one day , by no means a merry Andrew , and declared that the book would ruin him unless one or more changes were made in the text . What was amiss in it ? He turned to the “ Song of Marion 's Men , ” and stumbled over an obnoxious couplet in the first stanza :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The British soldier trembles</l>
     <l n="2">When Marion 's name is told . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ That wo n't do at all , you know . ” The absurdity of the objection must have struck the humorist comically ; but as he wanted the volume republished , he good-naturedly saved the proverbial valor of the British soldier by changing the first line to</p>
   <p>“ The foeman trembles in his camp , ”</p>
   <p>and the tempest in a teapot was over , as far as England was concerned . Not as far as the United States was concerned , however ; for when the circumstance became known to Mr. Leggett , he excoriated Mr. Irving for his subserviency to a bloated aristocracy , and so forth . Mr. John Wilson reviewed the book in Blackwood 's Magazine in a half-hearted way , patronizing the writer with his praise .</p>
   <p>The poems that Mr. Bryant wrote during the first seven years of his residence in New York ( some forty in number , not including translations ) exhibited the qualities which distinguished his genius from the beginning , and were marked by characteristics which were rather acquired than inherited . In other words , they were somewhat different from those which were written at Great Barrington . The Hellenic element was still visible in “ The Greek Partisan ” and “ The Greek Boy , ” and the aboriginal element in “ The Disinterred Warrior . ” The large imagination of “ The Hymn to the North Star ” was radiant in “ The Firmament , ” and in “ The Past . ” Ardent love of nature found expressive utterance in “ Lines on Revisiting the Country , ” “ The Gladness of Nature , ” “ A Summer Ramble , ” “ A Scene on the Banks of the Hudson , ” and “ The Evening Wind . ” The little book of immortal dirges had a fresh leaf added to it in “ The Death of the Flowers , ” which was at once a pastoral of autumn and a monody over a beloved sister . A new element appeared in “ The Summer Wind , ” and was always present afterward in Mr. Bryant 's meditative poetry — the association of humanity with nature — a calm but sympathetic recognition of the ways of man and his presence on the earth . The power of suggestion and of rapid generalization , which was the key-note of “ The Ages , ” lived anew in every line of “ The Prairies , ” in which a series of poems present themselves to the imagination as a series of pictures in a gallery — pictures in which breadth and vigor of treatment and exquisite delicacy of detail are everywhere harmoniously blended , and the unity of pure Art is attained . It was worth going to the ends of the world to be able to write “ The Prairies . ”</p>
   <p>Confiding in the discretion of his associate Mr. Leggett , and anxious to escape from his daily editorial labors , Mr. Bryant sailed for Europe with his family in the summer of 1834 . It was his intention to perfect his literary studies while abroad , and to devote himself to the education of his children ; but his intention was frustrated , after a short course of travel in France , Germany , and Italy , by the illness of Mr. Leggett , whose mistaken zeal in the advocacy of unpopular measures had seriously injured the Evening Post . He returned in haste early in 1836 , and devoted his time and energies to restoring the prosperity of his paper . Nine years passed before he ventured to return to Europe , though he managed to visit certain portions of his own country . His readers tracked his journeys through the letters which he wrote to the Evening Post , and which were noticeable for justness of observation and clearness of expression . A selection from Mr. Bryant 's foreign and home letters was published in 1852 , under the title of “ Letters of a Traveler . ”</p>
   <p>The life of a man of letters is seldom eventful . There are , of course , exceptions to the rule ; for literature , like other polite professions , is never without its disorderly followers . It is instructive to trace their careers , which are usually short ones ; but the contemplation of the calm , well-regulated , self-respecting lives of the elder and wiser masters is much more satisfactory . We pity the Maginns , and Mangans , and Poes , whom we have always with us ; but we admire and reverence such writers as Wordsworth , and Thackeray , and Bryant , who dignify their high calling . The last thirty years of the life of Mr. Bryant were devoid of incidents , though one of them ( 1866 ) was not without the supreme sorrow — death . He devoted himself to journalism as conscientiously as if he still had his spurs to win , discussing all public questions with independence and fearlessness ; and from time to time , as the spirit moved him , he added to our treasures of song , contributing to the popular magazines of the period , and occasionally issuing these contributions in separate volumes . He published “ The Fountain and Other Poems ” in 1842 ; “ The White-Footed Deer and Other Poems ” in 1844 ; a collected edition of his poems , with illustrations by Leutze , in 1846 ; an edition in two volumes in 1855 ; “ Thirty Poems ” in 1866 ; and in 1876 a complete illustrated edition of his poetical writings . To the honors which these volumes brought him he added fresh laurels in 1870 and 1871 by the publication of his translation of the “ Iliad ” and the “ Odyssey ” — a translation which was highly praised both at home and abroad , and which , if not the best that the English language is capable of , is , in many respects , the best which any English-writing poet has yet produced .</p>
   <p>There comes a day in the intellectual lives of most poets when their powers cease to be progressive and productive , or are productive only in the forms to which they have accustomed themselves , and which have become mannerisms . It was not so with Mr. Bryant . He enjoyed the dangerous distinction of proving himself a great poet at an early age ; he preserved this distinction to the last , for the sixty-four years which elapsed between the writing of “ Thanatopsis ” and the writing of “ The Flood of Years ” witnessed no decay of his poetic capacities , but rather the growth and development of trains of thought and forms of verse of which there was no evidence in his early writings . His sympathies were enlarged as the years went on , and the crystal clearness of his mind was colored with human emotions .</p>
   <p>To Bryant , beyond all other modern poets , the earth was a theatre upon which the great drama of life was everlastingly played . The remembrance of this fact is his inspiration in “ The Fountain , ” “ An Evening Revery , ” “ The Antiquity of Freedom , ” “ The Crowded Street , ” “ The Planting of the Apple-Tree , ” “ The Night Journey of a River , ” “ The Sower , ” and “ The Flood of Years . ” The most poetical of Mr. Bryant 's poems are , perhaps , “ The Land of Dreams , ” “ The Burial of Love , ” “ The May Sun sheds an Amber Light , ” and “ The Voice of Autumn ; ” and they were written in a succession of happy hours , and in the order named . Next to these pieces , as examples of pure poetry , should be placed “ Sella ” and “ The Little People of the Snow , ” which are exquisite fairy fantasies . The qualities by which Mr. Bryant 's poetry are chiefly distinguished are serenity and gravity of thought ; an intense though repressed recognition of the mortality of mankind ; an ardent love for human freedom ; and unrivaled skill in painting the scenery of his native land . He had no superior in this walk of poetic art — it might almost be said no equal , for his descriptions of nature are never inaccurate or redundant . “ The Excursion ” is a tiresome poem , which contains several exquisite episodes . Mr. Bryant knew how to write exquisite episodes , and to omit the platitudes through which we reach them in other poets .</p>
   <p>It is not given to many poets to possess as many residences as Mr. Bryant , for he had three — a town-house in New York , a country-house , called “ Cedarmere , ” at Roslyn , Long Island , and the old homestead of the Bryant family at Cummington . He passed the winter months in New York , and the summer and early autumn months at his country-houses . No distinguished man in America was better known by sight than he .</p>
   <p>“ O good gray head that all men knew ”</p>
   <p>rose unbidden to one 's lips as he passed his fellow-pedestrians in the streets of the great city , active , alert , with a springing step and a buoyant gait . He was seen in all weathers , walking down to his office in the morning , and back to his house in the afternoon — an observant antiquity , with a majestic white beard , a pair of sharp eyes , and a face which , noticed closely , recalled the line of the poet :</p>
   <p>“ A million wrinkles carved his skin . ”</p>
   <p>Mr. Bryant had a peculiar talent , in which the French excel — the talent of delivering discourses upon the lives and writings of eminent men ; and he was always in request after the death of his contemporaries .</p>
   <p>Beginning with a eulogy on his friend Cole , the painter , who died in 1848 , he paid his well-considered tributes to the memory of Cooper and Irving , and assisted at the dedication in the Central Park of the Morse , Shakespeare , Scott , and Halleck monuments . His addresses on those occasions , and others that might be named , were models of justice of appreciation and felicity of expression . His last public appearance was at the Central Park , on the afternoon of May 29 , 1878 , at the unveiling of a statue to Mazzini . It was an unusually hot day , and after delivering his address , which was remarkable for its eloquence , he accompanied General James Grant Wilson , an acquaintance of some years ’ standing , to his residence in East Seventy-fourth street . General Wilson reached his door with Mr. Bryant leaning on his arm ; he took a step in advance to open the inner door , and while his back was turned the poet fell , striking his head on the stone platform of the front steps . It was his death-blow ; for , though he recovered his consciousness sufficiently to converse a little , and was able to ride to his own house with General Wilson , his fate was sealed . He lingered until the morning of the 12th of June , when his capacious spirit passed out into the Unknown . Two days later all that was mortal of him was buried beside the grave of his wife at Roslyn .</p>
   <p>Such was the life and such the life-work of William Cullen Bryant .</p>

     <l n="1">To him who in the love of Nature holds</l>
     <l n="2">Communion with her visible forms , she speaks</l>
     <l n="3">A various language ; for his gayer hours</l>
     <l n="4">She has a voice of gladness , and a smile</l>
     <l n="5">And eloquence of beauty , and she glides</l>
     <l n="6">Into his darker musings , with a mild</l>
     <l n="7">And healing sympathy , that steals away</l>
     <l n="8">Their sharpness , ere he is aware . When thoughts</l>
     <l n="9">Of the last bitter hour come like a blight</l>
     <l n="10">Over thy spirit , and sad images</l>
     <l n="11">Of the stern agony , and shroud , and pall ,</l>
     <l n="12">And breathless darkness , and the narrow house ,</l>
     <l n="13">Make thee to shudder , and grow sick at heart ;—</l>
     <l n="14">Go forth , under the open sky , and list</l>
     <l n="15">To Nature 's teachings , while from all around —</l>
     <l n="16">Earth and her waters , and the depths of air —</l>
     <l n="17">Comes a still voice — Yet a few days , and thee</l>
     <l n="18">The all-beholding sun shall see no more</l>
     <l n="19">In all his course ; nor yet in the cold ground ,</l>
     <l n="20">Where thy pale form was laid , with many tears ,</l>
     <l n="21">Nor in the embrace of ocean , shall exist</l>
     <l n="22">Thy image . Earth , that nourished thee , shall claim</l>
     <l n="23">Thy growth , to be resolved to earth again ,</l>
     <l n="24">And , lost each human trace , surrendering up</l>
     <l n="25">Thine individual being , shalt thou go</l>
     <l n="26">To mix for ever with the elements ,</l>
     <l n="27">To be a brother to the insensible rock</l>
     <l n="28">And to the sluggish clod , which the rude swain</l>
     <l n="29">Turns with his share , and treads upon . The oak</l>
     <l n="30">Shall send his roots abroad , and pierce thy mould .</l>

     <l n="33">Couch more magnificent . Thou shalt lie down</l>
     <l n="34">With patriarchs of the infant world — with kings ,</l>
     <l n="35">The powerful of the earth — the wise , the good ,</l>
     <l n="36">Fair forms , and hoary seers of ages past ,</l>
     <l n="37">All in one mighty sepulchre . The hills</l>
     <l n="38">Rock-ribbed and ancient as the sun ,— the vales</l>
     <l n="39">Stretching in pensive quietness between ;</l>
     <l n="40">The venerable woods — rivers that move</l>
     <l n="41">In majesty , and the complaining brooks</l>
     <l n="42">That make the meadows green ; and , poured round all ,</l>
     <l n="43">Old Ocean 's gray and melancholy waste ,—</l>
     <l n="44">Are but the solemn decorations all</l>
     <l n="45">Of the great tomb of man . The golden sun ,</l>
     <l n="46">The planets , all the infinite host of heaven ,</l>
     <l n="47">Are shining on the sad abodes of death ,</l>
     <l n="48">Through the still lapse of ages . All that tread</l>
     <l n="49">The globe are but a handful to the tribes</l>
     <l n="50">That slumber in its bosom .— -  Take the wings</l>
     <l n="51">Of morning , pierce the Barean wilderness ,</l>
     <l n="52">Or lose thyself in the continuous woods</l>
     <l n="53">Where rolls the Oregon , and hears no sound ,</l>
     <l n="54">Save his own dashings — yet the dead are there :</l>
     <l n="55">And millions in those solitudes , since first</l>
     <l n="56">The flight of years began , have laid them down</l>
     <l n="57">In their last sleep — the dead reign there alone ,</l>
     <l n="58">So shalt thou rest , and what if thou withdraw</l>
     <l n="59">In silence from the living , and no friend</l>
     <l n="60">Take note of thy departure ? All that breathe</l>
     <l n="61">Will share thy destiny . The gay will laugh</l>
     <l n="62">When thou art gone , the solemn brood of care</l>
     <l n="63">Plod on , and each one as before will chase</l>
     <l n="64">His favorite phantom ; yet all these shall leave</l>
     <l n="65">Their mirth and their employments , and shall come</l>
     <l n="66">And make their bed with thee . As the long train</l>
     <l n="67">Of ages glide away , the sons of men ,</l>
     <l n="68">The youth in life 's green spring , and he who goes</l>
     <l n="69">In the full strength of years , matron and maid ,</l>
     <l n="70">The speechless babe , and the gray-headed man —</l>
     <l n="71">Shall one by one be gathered to thy side ,</l>
     <l n="72">By those , who in their turn shall follow them .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="73">So live , that when thy summons comes to join</l>
     <l n="74">The innumerable caravan , which moves</l>
     <l n="75">To that mysterious realm , where each shall take</l>
     <l n="76">His chamber in the silent halls of death ,</l>
     <l n="77">Thou go not , like the quarry-slave at night ,</l>
     <l n="78">Scourged to his dungeon , but , sustained and soothed</l>
     <l n="79">By an unfaltering trust , approach thy grave ,</l>
     <l n="80">Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch</l>
     <l n="81">About him , and lies down to pleasant dreams .</l>

    <head>INSCRIPTION FOR THE ENTRANCE TO A WOOD .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Stranger , if thou hast learned a truth which needs</l>
     <l n="2">No school of long experience , that the world</l>
     <l n="3">Is full of guilt and misery , and hast seen</l>
     <l n="4">Enough of all its sorrows , crimes , and cares ,</l>
     <l n="5">To tire thee of it , enter this wild wood</l>
     <l n="6">And view the haunts of Nature . The calm shade</l>
     <l n="7">Shall bring a kindred calm , and the sweet breeze</l>
     <l n="8">That makes the green leaves dance , shall waft a balm</l>
     <l n="9">To thy sick heart . Thou wilt find nothing here</l>
     <l n="10">Of all that pained thee in the haunts of men ,</l>
     <l n="11">And made thee loathe thy life . The primal curse</l>
     <l n="12">Fell , it is true , upon the unsinning earth ,</l>
     <l n="13">But not in vengeance . God hath yoked to guilt</l>
     <l n="14">Her pale tormentor , misery . Hence , these shades</l>
     <l n="15">Are still the abodes of gladness ; the thick roof</l>
     <l n="16">Of green and stirring branches is alive</l>
     <l n="17">And musical with birds , that sing and sport</l>
     <l n="18">In wantonness of spirit ; while below</l>
     <l n="19">The squirrel , with raised paws and form erect ,</l>
     <l n="20">Chirps merrily . Throngs of insects in the shade</l>
     <l n="21">Try their thin wings and dance in the warm beam</l>
     <l n="22">That waked them into life . Even the green trees</l>
     <l n="23">Partake the deep contentment ; as they bend</l>
     <l n="24">To the soft winds , the sun from the blue sky</l>
     <l n="25">Looks in and sheds a blessing on the scene .</l>
     <l n="26">Scarce less the cleft-born wild-flower seems to enjoy</l>
     <l n="27">Existence , than the wingèd plunderer</l>
     <l n="28">That sucks its sweets . The mossy rocks themselves ,</l>
     <l n="29">And the old and ponderous trunks of prostrate trees</l>
     <l n="30">That lead from knoll to knoll a causey rude</l>
     <l n="31">Or bridge the sunken brook , and their dark roots ,</l>
     <l n="32">With all their earth upon them , twisting high ,</l>
     <l n="33">Breathe fixed tranquillity . The rivulet</l>
     <l n="34">Sends forth glad sounds , and tripping o'er its bed</l>
     <l n="35">Of pebbly sands , or leaping down the rocks ,</l>
     <l n="36">Seems , with continuous laughter , to rejoice</l>
     <l n="37">In its own being . Softly tread the marge ,</l>
     <l n="38">Lest from her midway perch thou scare the wren</l>
     <l n="39">That dips her bill in water . The cool wind ,</l>
     <l n="40">That stirs the stream in play , shall come to thee .</l>
     <l n="41">Like one that loves thee nor will let thee pass</l>

     <l n="14">The thoughts that broke my peace , and I began</l>
     <l n="15">To gather simples by the fountain 's brink ,</l>
     <l n="16">And lose myself in day-dreams . While I stood</l>
     <l n="17">In Nature 's loneliness , I was with one</l>
     <l n="18">With whom I early grew familiar , one</l>
     <l n="19">Who never had a frown for me , whose voice</l>
     <l n="20">Never rebuked me for the hours I stole</l>
     <l n="21">From cares I loved not , but of which the world</l>
     <l n="22">Deems highest , to converse with her . When shrieked</l>
     <l n="23">The bleak November winds , and smote the woods ,</l>
     <l n="24">And the brown fields were herbless , and the shades .</l>
     <l n="25">That met above the merry rivulet .</l>
     <l n="26">Were spoiled , I sought , I loved them still ; they seemed</l>
     <l n="27">Like old companions in adversity .</l>
     <l n="28">Still there was beauty in my walks ; the brook ,</l>
     <l n="29">Bordered with sparkling frost-work , was as gay</l>
     <l n="30">As with its fringe of summer flowers . Afar ,</l>
     <l n="31">The village with its spires , the path of streams</l>
     <l n="32">And dim receding valleys , hid before</l>
     <l n="33">By interposing trees , lay visible</l>
     <l n="34">Through the bare grove , and my familiar haunts</l>
     <l n="35">Seemed new to me . Nor was I slow to come</l>
     <l n="36">Among them , when the clouds , from their still skirts ,</l>
     <l n="37">Had shaken down on earth the feathery snow ,</l>
     <l n="38">And all was white . The pure keen air abroad ,</l>
     <l n="39">Albeit it breathed no scent of herb , nor heard</l>
     <l n="40">Love-call of bird nor merry hum of bee ,</l>
     <l n="41">Was not the air of death , Bright mosses crept</l>
     <l n="42">Over the spotted trunks , and the close buds ,</l>
     <l n="43">That lay along the boughs , instinct with life ,</l>
     <l n="44">Patient , and waiting the soft breath of Spring ,</l>
     <l n="45">Feared not the piercing spirit of the North .</l>
     <l n="46">The snow-bird twittered on the beechen bough ,</l>
     <l n="47">And ‘ neath the hemlock , whose thick branches bent</l>
     <l n="48">Beneath its bright cold burden , and kept dry</l>
     <l n="49">A circle , on the earth , of withered leaves ,</l>
     <l n="50">The partridge found a shelter . Through the snow</l>
     <l n="51">The rabbit sprang away . The lighter track</l>
     <l n="52">Of fox , and the raccoon 's broad path , were there ,</l>
     <l n="53">Crossing each other . From his hollow tree</l>
     <l n="54">The squirrel was abroad , gathering the nuts</l>
     <l n="55">Just fallen , that asked the winter cold and sway</l>
     <l n="56">Of winter blast , to shake them from their hold .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="57">But Winter has yet brighter scenes — he boasts</l>
     <l n="58">Splendors beyond what gorgeous Summer knows ;</l>
     <l n="59">Or Autumn with his many fruits , and woods</l>
     <l n="60">All flushed with many hues . Come when the rains</l>
     <l n="61">Have glazed the snow and clothed the trees with ice ,</l>
     <l n="62">While the slant sun of February pours</l>
     <l n="63">Into the bowers a flood of light . Approach !</l>
     <l n="64">The incrusted surface shall upbear thy steps ,</l>
     <l n="65">And the broad arching portals of the grove</l>
     <l n="66">Welcome thy entering . Look ! the massy trunks</l>
     <l n="67">Are cased in the pure crystal ; each light spray ,</l>
     <l n="68">Nodding and tinkling in the breath of heaven ,</l>
     <l n="69">Is studded with its trembling water-drops ,</l>
     <l n="70">That glimmer with an amethystine light .</l>
     <l n="71">But round the parent-stem the long low boughs</l>
     <l n="72">Bend , in a glittering ring , and arbors hide</l>
     <l n="73">The glassy floor . Oh ! you might deem the spot</l>
     <l n="74">The spacious cavern of some virgin mine ,</l>
     <l n="75">Deep in the womb of earth — where the gems grow ,</l>
     <l n="76">And diamonds put forth radiant rods and bud</l>
     <l n="77">With amethyst and topaz — and the place</l>
     <l n="78">Lit up , most royally , with the pure beam</l>
     <l n="79">That dwells in them . Or haply the vast hall</l>
     <l n="80">Of fairy palace , that outlasts the night ,</l>
     <l n="81">And fades not in the glory of the sun ;—</l>
     <l n="82">Where crystal columns send forth slender shafts</l>
     <l n="83">And crossing arches ; and fantastic aisles</l>
     <l n="84">Wind from the sight in brightness , and are lost</l>
     <l n="85">Among the crowded pillars . Raise thine eye ;</l>
     <l n="86">Thou seest no cavern roof , no palace vault ;</l>
     <l n="87">There the blue sky and the white drifting cloud</l>
     <l n="88">Look in . Again the wildered fancy dreams</l>
     <l n="89">Of spouting fountains , frozen as they rose ,</l>
     <l n="90">And fixed , with all their branching jets , in air ,</l>
     <l n="91">And all their sluices sealed . All , all is light ;</l>
     <l n="92">Light without shade . But all shall pass away</l>
     <l n="93">With the next sun . From numberless vast trunks</l>
     <l n="94">Loosened , the crashing ice shall make a sound</l>
     <l n="95">Like the far roar of rivers , and the eve</l>
     <l n="96">Shall close o'er the brown woods as it was wont .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="97">And it is pleasant , when the noisy streams</l>
     <l n="98">Are just set free , and milder suns melt off</l>
     <l n="99">The plashy snow , save only the firm drift</l>
     <l n="100">In the deep glen or the close shade of pines —</l>
     <l n="101">‘ Tis pleasant to behold the wreaths of smoke</l>
     <l n="102">Roll up among the maples of the hill ,</l>
     <l n="103">Where the shrill sound of youthful voices wakes</l>
     <l n="104">The shriller echo , as the clear pure lymph ,</l>
     <l n="105">That from the wounded trees , in twinkling drops ,</l>
     <l n="106">Falls , mid the golden brightness of the morn ,</l>
     <l n="107">Is gathered in with brimming pails , and oft ,</l>
     <l n="108">Wielded by sturdy hands , the stroke of axe</l>
     <l n="109">Makes the woods ring . Along the quiet air ,</l>
     <l n="110">Come and float calmly off the soft light clouds ,</l>
     <l n="111">Such as you see in summer , and the winds</l>
     <l n="112">Scarce stir the branches . Lodged in sunny cleft ,</l>
     <l n="113">Where the cold breezes come not , blooms alone</l>
     <l n="114">The little wind-flower , whose just opened eye</l>
     <l n="115">Is blue as the spring heaven it gazes at —</l>
     <l n="116">Startling the loiterer in the naked groves</l>
     <l n="117">With unexpected beauty , for the time</l>
     <l n="118">Of blossoms and green leaves is yet afar .</l>
     <l n="119">And ere it comes , the encountering winds shall oft</l>
     <l n="120">Muster their wrath again , and rapid clouds</l>
     <l n="121">Shade heaven , and bounding on the frozen earth</l>
     <l n="122">Shall fall their volleyed stores , rounded like hail</l>
     <l n="123">And white like snow , and the loud North again</l>

    <head>THE BURIAL-PLACE .</head>
    <head>A FRAGMENT .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Erewhile , on England 's pleasant shores , our sires</l>
     <l n="2">Left not their churchyards unadorned with shades</l>
     <l n="3">Or blossoms , but indulgent to the strong</l>
     <l n="4">And natural dread of man 's last home , the grave ,</l>
     <l n="5">Its frost and silence — they disposed around ,</l>
     <l n="6">To soothe the melancholy spirit that dwelt</l>
     <l n="7">Too sadly on life 's close , the forms and hues</l>
     <l n="8">Of vegetable beauty . There the yew ,</l>
     <l n="9">Green ever amid the snows of winter , told</l>
     <l n="10">Of immortality , and gracefully</l>
     <l n="11">The willow , a perpetual mourner , drooped ;</l>
     <l n="12">And there the gadding woodbine crept about ,</l>
     <l n="13">And there the ancient ivy . From the spot</l>
     <l n="14">Where the sweet maiden , in her blossoming years</l>
     <l n="15">Cut off , was laid with streaming eyes , and hands</l>
     <l n="16">That trembled as they placed her there , the rose</l>
     <l n="17">Sprung modest , on bowed stalk , and better spoke</l>
     <l n="18">Her graces , than the proudest monument .</l>
     <l n="19">There children set about their playmate 's grave</l>
     <l n="20">The pansy . On the infant 's little bed ,</l>
     <l n="21">Wet at its planting with maternal tears ,</l>
     <l n="22">Emblem of early sweetness , early death ,</l>
     <l n="23">Nestled the lowly primrose . Childless dames ,</l>
     <l n="24">And maids that would not raise the reddened eye —</l>
     <l n="25">Orphans , from whose young lids the light of joy</l>
     <l n="26">Fled early — silent lovers , who had given</l>
     <l n="27">All that they lived for to the arms of earth ,</l>
     <l n="28">Came often , o'er the recent graves to strew</l>

     <l n="33">Brought not these simple customs of the heart</l>
     <l n="34">With them . It might be , while they laid their dead</l>
     <l n="35">By the vast solemn skirts of the old groves ,</l>
     <l n="36">And the fresh virgin soil poured forth strange flowers</l>
     <l n="37">About their graves ; and the familiar shades</l>
     <l n="38">Of their own native isle , and wonted blooms ,</l>
     <l n="39">And herbs were wanting , which the pious hand</l>

     <l n="22">Meet is it that my voice should utter forth</l>

     <l n="84">Trembles , as , doubly terrible , at length ,</l>

     <l n="98">Of wolf and bear , the offerings of the tribe</l>
     <l n="99">Here made to the Great Spirit , for they deemed ,</l>

     <l n="119">Of him she loved with an unlawful love ,</l>
     <l n="120">And came to die for , a warm gush of tears</l>
     <l n="121">Ran from her eyes . But when the sun grew low</l>
     <l n="122">And the hill shadows long , she threw herself</l>
     <l n="123">From the steep rock and perished . There was scooped ,</l>
     <l n="124">Upon the mountain 's southern slope , a grave ;</l>
     <l n="125">And there they laid her , in the very garb</l>
     <l n="126">With which the maiden decked herself for death ,</l>
     <l n="127">With the same withering wild-flowers in her hair .</l>
     <l n="128">And o'er the mould that covered her , the tribe</l>
     <l n="129">Built up a simple monument , a cone</l>
     <l n="130">Of small loose stones . Thenceforward all who passed ,</l>
     <l n="131">Hunter , and dame , and virgin , laid a stone</l>
     <l n="132">In silence on the pile . It stands there yet .</l>
     <l n="133">And Indians from the distant West , who come</l>
     <l n="134">To visit where their fathers ’ bones are laid ,</l>
     <l n="135">Yet tell the sorrowful tale , and to this day</l>
     <l n="136">The mountain where the hapless maiden died</l>
     <l n="137">Is called the Mountain of the Monument .</l>

     <l n="4">They rustle to the eddying gust , and to the rabbit 's tread ;</l>
     <l n="5">The robin and the wren are flown , and from the shrubs the jay ,</l>

     <l n="9">Alas ! they all are in their graves , the gentle race of flowers</l>
     <l n="10">Are lying in their lowly beds , with the fair and good of ours .</l>
     <l n="11">The rain is falling where they lie , but the cold November rain</l>

     <l n="15">But on the hills the golden-rod , and the aster in the wood ,</l>
     <l n="16">And the yellow sun-flower by the brook in autumn beauty stood ,</l>
     <l n="17">Till fell the frost from the clear cold heaven , as falls the plague on men ,</l>
     <l n="18">And the brightness of their smile was gone , from upland , glade , and glen .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">And now , when comes the calm mild day , as still such days will come ,</l>

     <l n="21">When the sound of dropping nuts is heard ,</l>
     <l n="22">though all the trees ’ added are still ,</l>
     <l n="23">And twinkle in the smoky light the waters of the rill ,</l>
     <l n="24">The south wind searches for the flowers whose fragrance late he bore ,</l>

     <l n="26">And then I think of one who in her youthful beauty died ,</l>
     <l n="27">The fair meek blossom that grew up and faded by my side .</l>
     <l n="28">In the cold moist earth we laid her , when the forests cast the leaf ,</l>
     <l n="29">And we wept that one so lovely should have a life so brief :</l>
     <l n="30">Yet not unmeet it was that one , like that young friend of ours ,</l>
     <l n="31">So gentle and so beautiful , should perish with the flowers .</l>

     <l n="1">Where olive-leaves were twinkling in every wind that blew ,</l>
     <l n="2">There sat beneath the pleasant shade a damsel of Peru .</l>
     <l n="3">Betwixt the slender boughs , as they opened to the air ,</l>
     <l n="4">Came glimpses of her ivory neck and of her glossy hair ;</l>
     <l n="5">And sweetly rang her silver voice , within that shady nook ,</l>

     <l n="10">Had rushed the Christians like a flood , and swept away the foe .</l>
     <l n="11">Awhile that melody is still , and then breaks forth anew</l>

     <l n="23">For the noon is coming on , and the sunbeams fiercely beat ,</l>

     <l n="28">A ballad of a tender maid heart-broken long ago ,</l>
     <l n="29">Of him who died in battle , the youthful and the brave ,</l>
     <l n="30">And her who died of sorrow , upon his early grave .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="31">And see , along that mountain-slope , a fiery horseman ride ;</l>

     <l n="33">His spurs are buried rowel-deep , he rides with loosened rain ,</l>
     <l n="34">There 's blood upon his charger 's flank and foam upon the mane .</l>
     <l n="35">He speeds him toward the olive-grove , along that shaded hill !</l>
     <l n="36">God shield the helpless maiden there , if he should mean her ill !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="37">And suddenly that song has ceased , and suddenly I hear</l>
     <l n="38">A shriek sent up amid the shade , a shriek — but not of fear .</l>
     <l n="39">For tender accents follow , and tender pauses speak</l>
     <l n="40">The overflow of gladness , when words are all too weak ;</l>
     <l n="41">“ I lay my good sword at thy feet , for now Peru is free ,</l>
     <l n="42">And I am come to dwell beside the olive-grove with thee . ”</l>

     <l n="66">In the sounds that rise from the murmuring grass .</l>
     <l n="67">They sit where their humble cottage stood ,</l>

     <l n="70">Of the brook that wets the rocks below ,</l>

     <l n="1">These are the gardens of the Desert , these</l>
     <l n="2">The unshorn fields , boundless and beautiful ,</l>
     <l n="3">For which the speech of England has no name —</l>
     <l n="4">The Prairies . I behold them for the first ,</l>
     <l n="5">And my heart swells , while the dilated sight</l>
     <l n="6">Takes in the encircling vastness . Lo ! they stretch ,</l>
     <l n="7">In airy undulations , far away ,</l>
     <l n="8">As if the ocean , in his gentlest swell ,</l>
     <l n="9">Stood still , with all his rounded billows fixed ,</l>
     <l n="10">And motionless forever .— Motionless ?—</l>
     <l n="11">No — they are all unchained again . The clouds</l>

     <l n="13">The surface rolls and fluctuates to the eye ;</l>
     <l n="14">Dark hollows seem to glide along and chase</l>
     <l n="15">The sunny ridges . Breezes of the South !</l>

     <l n="24">Man hath no power in all this glorious work :</l>
     <l n="25">The hand that built the firmament hath heaved</l>
     <l n="26">And smoothed these verdant swells , and sown their slopes</l>
     <l n="27">With herbage , planted them with island groves ,</l>
     <l n="28">And hedged them round with forests . Fitting floor</l>
     <l n="29">For this magnificent temple of the sky —</l>
     <l n="30">With flowers whose glory and whose multitude</l>
     <l n="31">Rival the constellations ! The great heavens</l>
     <l n="32">Seem to stoop down upon the scene in love ,—</l>

     <l n="38">A sacrilegious sound . I think of those</l>
     <l n="39">Upon whose rest he tramples . Are they here —</l>
     <l n="40">The dead of other days ?— and did the dust</l>
     <l n="41">Of these fair solitudes once stir with life</l>

     <l n="45">Answer . A race , that long has passed away ,</l>
     <l n="46">Built them ;— a disciplined and populous race</l>
     <l n="47">Heaped , with long toil , the earth , while yet the Greek</l>
     <l n="48">Was hewing the Pentelicus to forms</l>
     <l n="49">Of symmetry , and rearing on its rock</l>
     <l n="50">The glittering Parthenon . These ample fields</l>
     <l n="51">Nourished their harvests , here their herds were fed ,</l>
     <l n="52">When haply by their stalls the bison lowed ,</l>
     <l n="53">And bowed his manèd shoulder to the yoke .</l>
     <l n="54">All day this desert murmured with their toils ,</l>
     <l n="55">Till twilight blushed , and lovers walked , and wooed</l>
     <l n="56">In a forgotten language , and old tunes ,</l>
     <l n="57">From instruments of unremembered form ,</l>
     <l n="58">Gave the soft winds a voice . The red man came —</l>
     <l n="59">The roaming hunter tribes , warlike and fierce ,</l>
     <l n="60">And the mound-builders vanished from the earth .</l>
     <l n="61">The solitude of centuries untold</l>
     <l n="62">Has settled where they dwelt . The prairie-wolf</l>
     <l n="63">Hunts in their meadows , and his fresh-dug den</l>
     <l n="64">Yawns by my path . The gopher mines the ground</l>
     <l n="65">Where stood their swarming cities . All is gone ;</l>
     <l n="66">All — save the piles of earth that hold their bones ,</l>
     <l n="67">The platforms where they worshipped unknown gods ,</l>
     <l n="68">The barriers which they builded from the soil</l>
     <l n="69">To keep the foe at bay — till o'er the walls</l>
     <l n="70">The wild beleaguerers broke , and , one by one ,</l>
     <l n="71">The strongholds of the plain were forced , and heaped</l>
     <l n="72">With corpses . The brown vultures of the wood</l>
     <l n="73">Flocked to those vast uncovered sepulchres ,</l>
     <l n="74">And sat unscared and silent at their feast .</l>
     <l n="75">Haply some solitary fugitive ,</l>
     <l n="76">Lurking in marsh and forest , till the sense</l>
     <l n="77">Of desolation and of fear became</l>
     <l n="78">Bitterer than death , yielded himself to die .</l>
     <l n="79">Man 's better nature triumphed then . Kind words</l>
     <l n="80">Welcomed and soothed him ; the rude conquerors</l>
     <l n="81">Seated the captive with their chiefs ; he chose</l>
     <l n="82">A bride among their maidens , and at length</l>
     <l n="83">Seemed to forget — yet ne'er forgot — the wife</l>
     <l n="84">Of his first love , and her sweet little ones ,</l>
     <l n="85">Butchered , amid their shrieks , with all his race .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="86">Thus change the forms of being . Thus arise</l>
     <l n="87">Races of living things , glorious in strength ,</l>
     <l n="88">And perish , as the quickening breath of God</l>
     <l n="89">Fills them , or is withdrawn . The red man , too ,</l>
     <l n="90">Has left the blooming wilds he ranged so long ,</l>
     <l n="91">And nearer to the Rocky Mountains , sought</l>
     <l n="92">A wilder hunting-ground . The beaver builds</l>
     <l n="93">No longer by these streams , but far away ,</l>
     <l n="94">On waters whose blue surface ne'er gave back</l>
     <l n="95">The white man 's face — among Missouri 's springs ,</l>
     <l n="96">And pools whose issues swell the Oregon —</l>
     <l n="97">He rears his little Venice . In these plains</l>
     <l n="98">The bison feeds no more . Twice twenty leagues</l>
     <l n="99">Beyond remotest smoke of hunter 's camp ,</l>
     <l n="100">Roams the majestic brute , in herds that shake</l>
     <l n="101">The earth with thundering steps — yet here I meet</l>

     <l n="106">And birds , that scarce have learned the fear of man ,</l>
     <l n="107">Are here , and sliding reptiles of the ground ,</l>
     <l n="108">Startlingly beautiful . The graceful deer</l>
     <l n="109">Bounds to the wood at my approach . The bee ,</l>
     <l n="110">A more adventurous colonist than man ,</l>
     <l n="111">With whom he came across the eastern deep ,</l>
     <l n="112">Fills the savannas with his murmurings ,</l>
     <l n="113">And hides his sweets , as in the golden age ,</l>
     <l n="114">Within the hollow oak . I listen long</l>
     <l n="115">To his domestic hum , and think I hear</l>
     <l n="116">The sound of that advancing multitude</l>
     <l n="117">Which soon shall fill these deserts . From the ground</l>
     <l n="118">Comes up the laugh of children , the soft voice</l>
     <l n="119">Of maidens , and the sweet and solemn hymn</l>
     <l n="120">Of Sabbath worshippers . The low of herds</l>
     <l n="121">Blends with the rustling of the heavy grain</l>
     <l n="122">Over the dark brown furrows . All at once</l>
     <l n="123">A fresher wind sweeps by , and breaks my dream ,</l>
     <l n="124">And I am in the wilderness alone .</l>

    <head>THE ALCAYDE OF MOLINA .</head>
    <head>FROM THE SPANISH .</head>
     <l n="1">To the town of Atienza , Molina 's brave Alcayde ,</l>
     <l n="2">The courteous and the valorous , led forth his bold brigade .</l>
     <l n="3">The Moor came back in triumph , he came without a wound ,</l>
     <l n="4">With many a Christian standard , and Christian captive bound .</l>
     <l n="5">He passed the city portals , with swelling heart and vain ,</l>
     <l n="6">And toward his lady 's dwelling he rode with slackened rein ;</l>
     <l n="7">Two circuits on his charger he took , and at the third ,</l>
     <l n="8">From the door of her balcony Zelinda 's voice was heard .</l>
     <l n="9">“ Now if thou wert not shameless , ” said the lady to the Moor ,</l>
     <l n="10">“ Thou wouldst neither pass my dwelling , nor stop before my door .</l>
     <l n="11">Alas for poor Zelinda , and for her wayward mood ,</l>
     <l n="12">That one in love with peace should have loved a man of blood !</l>
     <l n="13">Since not that thou wert noble I chose thee for my knight ,</l>
     <l n="14">But that thy sword was dreaded in tournay and in fight .</l>
     <l n="15">Ah , thoughtless and unhappy ! that I should fail to see</l>
     <l n="16">How ill the stubborn flint and the yielding wax agree .</l>
     <l n="17">Boast not thy love for me , while the shrieking of the fife</l>
     <l n="18">Can change thy mood of mildness to fury and to strife .</l>
     <l n="19">Say not my voice is magic — thy pleasure is to hear</l>
     <l n="20">The bursting of the carbine , and shivering of the spear .</l>
     <l n="21">Well , follow thou thy choice — to the battle-field away ,</l>
     <l n="22">To thy triumphs and thy trophies , since I am less than they .</l>
     <l n="23">Thrust thy arm into thy buckler , gird on thy crooked brand ,</l>
     <l n="24">And call upon thy trusty squire to bring thy spears in hand .</l>
     <l n="25">Lead forth thy band to skirmish , by mountain and by mead ,</l>
     <l n="26">On thy dappled Moorish barb , or thy fleeter border steed .</l>
     <l n="27">Go , waste the Christian hamlets , and sweep away their flocks ,</l>
     <l n="28">From Almazan 's broad meadows to Siguenza 's rocks .</l>
     <l n="29">Leave Zelinda altogether , whom thou leavest oft and long ,</l>
     <l n="30">And in the life thou lovest , forget whom thou dost wrong .</l>
     <l n="31">These eyes shall not recall thee , though they meet no more thine own ,</l>
     <l n="32">Though they weep that thou art absent , and that I am all alone . ”</l>
     <l n="33">She ceased , and turning from him her flushed and angry cheek ,</l>
     <l n="34">Shut the door of her balcony before the Moor could speak .</l>

     <l n="5">Rolled from the organ ! Underneath my feet</l>

     <l n="22">Exalted the mind 's faculties and strung</l>
     <l n="23">The body 's sinews . Brave he was in fight ,</l>
     <l n="24">Courteous in banquet , scornful of repose ,</l>
     <l n="25">And bountiful , and cruel , and devout ,</l>
     <l n="26">And quick to draw the sword in private feud ,</l>
     <l n="27">He pushed his quarrels to the death , yet prayed</l>
     <l n="28">The saints as fervently on bended knees</l>
     <l n="29">As ever shaven cenobite . He loved</l>

     <l n="31">The maid that pleased him from her bower by night</l>
     <l n="32">To his hill castle , as the eagle bears</l>
     <l n="33">His victim from the fold , and rolled the rocks</l>
     <l n="34">On his pursuers . He aspired to see</l>
     <l n="35">His native Pisa queen and arbitress</l>
     <l n="36">Of cities ; earnestly for her he raised</l>
     <l n="37">His voice in council , and affronted death</l>
     <l n="38">In battle-field , and climbed the galley 's deck ,</l>
     <l n="39">And brought the captured flag of Genoa back ,</l>
     <l n="40">Or piled upon the Arno 's crowded quay</l>
     <l n="41">The glittering spoils of the tamed Saracen .</l>
     <l n="42">He was not born to brook the stranger 's yoke ,</l>
     <l n="43">But would have joined the exiles that withdrew</l>
     <l n="44">Forever , when the Florentine broke in</l>
     <l n="45">The gates of Pisa , and bore off the bolts</l>
     <l n="46">For trophies — but he died before that day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="47">“ He lived , the impersonation of an age</l>
     <l n="48">That never shall return . His soul of fire</l>
     <l n="49">Was kindled by the breath of the rude time</l>
     <l n="50">He lived in . Now a gentler race succeeds ,</l>
     <l n="51">Shuddering at blood ; the effeminate cavalier ,</l>
     <l n="52">Turning his eyes from the reproachful past ,</l>
     <l n="53">And from the hopeless future , gives to ease ,</l>
     <l n="54">And love , and music , his inglorious life . ”</l>

     <l n="8">And withered ; seeds have fallen upon the soil ,</l>

    <head>A RAIN-DREAM .</head>
     <l n="1">These strifes , these tumults of the noisy world ,</l>
     <l n="2">Where Fraud , the coward , tracks his prey by stealth ,</l>
     <l n="3">And Strength , the ruffian , glories in his guilt ,</l>
     <l n="4">Oppress the heart with sadness . Oh , my friend ,</l>
     <l n="5">In what serener mood we look upon</l>
     <l n="6">The gloomiest aspects of the elements</l>
     <l n="7">Among the woods and fields ! Let us awhile ,</l>
     <l n="8">As the slow wind is rolling up the storm ,</l>
     <l n="9">In fancy leave this maze of dusty streets ,</l>
     <l n="10">Forever shaken by the importunate jar</l>
     <l n="11">Of commerce , and upon the darkening air</l>
     <l n="12">Look from the shelter of our rural home .</l>
     <l n="13">Who is not awed that listens to the Rain ,</l>
     <l n="14">Sending his voice before him ? Mighty Rain !</l>
     <l n="15">The upland steeps are shrouded by thy mists ;</l>
     <l n="16">Thy shadow fills the hollow vale ; the pools</l>
     <l n="17">No longer glimmer , and the silvery streams</l>
     <l n="18">Darken to veins of lead at thy approach .</l>
     <l n="19">O mighty Rain ! already thou art here ;</l>
     <l n="20">And every roof is beaten by thy streams ,</l>
     <l n="21">And , as thou passest , every glassy spring</l>
     <l n="22">Grows rough , and every leaf in all the woods</l>
     <l n="23">Is struck , and quivers . All the hill-tops slake</l>
     <l n="24">Their thirst from thee ; a thousand languishing fields ,</l>
     <l n="25">A thousand fainting gardens , are refreshed ;</l>
     <l n="26">A thousand idle rivulets start to speed ,</l>
     <l n="27">And with the graver murmur of the storm</l>
     <l n="28">Blend their light voices as they hurry on .</l>
     <l n="29">Thou fill'st the circle of the atmosphere</l>
     <l n="30">Alone ; there is no living thing abroad ,</l>
     <l n="31">No bird to wing the air nor beast to walk</l>
     <l n="32">The field ; the squirrel in the forest seeks</l>
     <l n="33">His hollow tree ; the marmot of the field</l>
     <l n="34">Has scampered to his den ; the butterfly</l>
     <l n="35">Hides under her broad leaf ; the insect crowds ,</l>
     <l n="36">That made the sunshine populous , lie close</l>
     <l n="37">In their mysterious shelters , whence the sun</l>
     <l n="38">Will summon them again . The mighty Rain</l>
     <l n="39">Holds the vast empire of the sky alone .</l>
     <l n="40">I shut my eyes , and see , as in a dream ,</l>
     <l n="41">The friendly clouds drop down spring violets</l>
     <l n="42">And summer columbines , and all the flowers</l>
     <l n="43">That tuft the woodland floor , or overarch</l>
     <l n="44">The streamlet :— spiky grass for genial June ,</l>
     <l n="45">Brown harvests for the waiting husbandman ,</l>
     <l n="46">And for the woods a deluge of fresh leaves .</l>
     <l n="47">I see these myriad drops that slake the dust ,</l>
     <l n="48">Gathered in glorious streams , or rolling blue</l>
     <l n="49">In billows on the lake or on the deep ,</l>
     <l n="50">And bearing navies . I behold them change</l>
     <l n="51">To threads of crystal as they sink in earth</l>
     <l n="52">And leave its stains behind , to rise again</l>
     <l n="53">In pleasant nooks of verdure , where the child ,</l>
     <l n="54">Thirsty with play , in both his little hands</l>
     <l n="55">Shall take the cool , clear water , raising it</l>
     <l n="56">To wet his pretty lips . To-morrow noon</l>
     <l n="57">How proudly will the water-lily ride</l>
     <l n="58">The brimming pool , o'erlooking , like a queen ,</l>
     <l n="59">Her circle of broad leaves ! In lonely wastes ,</l>
     <l n="60">When next the sunshine makes them beautiful ,</l>
     <l n="61">Gay troops of butterflies shall light to drink</l>
     <l n="62">At the replenished hollows of the rock .</l>
     <l n="63">Now slowly falls the dull blank night , and still ,</l>
     <l n="64">All through the starless hours , the mighty Rain</l>
     <l n="65">Smites with perpetual sound the forest-leaves ,</l>
     <l n="66">And beats the matted grass , and still the earth</l>
     <l n="67">Drinks the unstinted bounty of the clouds —</l>
     <l n="68">Drinks for her cottage wells , her woodland brooks —</l>
     <l n="69">Drinks for the springing trout , the toiling bee ,</l>
     <l n="70">And brooding bird — drinks for her tender flowers ,</l>
     <l n="71">Tall oaks , and all the herbage of her hills .</l>
     <l n="72">A melancholy sound is in the air ,</l>
     <l n="73">A deep sigh in the distance , a shrill wail</l>
     <l n="74">Around my dwelling . ‘ Tis the Wind of night ;</l>
     <l n="75">A lonely wanderer between earth and cloud ,</l>
     <l n="76">In the black shadow and the chilly mist ,</l>
     <l n="77">Along the streaming mountain-side , and through</l>
     <l n="78">The dripping woods , and o'er the plashy fields ,</l>
     <l n="79">Roaming and sorrowing still , like one who makes</l>
     <l n="80">The journey of life alone , and nowhere meets</l>
     <l n="81">A welcome or a friend , and still goes on</l>
     <l n="82">In darkness . Yet a while , a little while ,</l>
     <l n="83">And he shall toss the glittering leaves in play ,</l>
     <l n="84">And dally with the flowers , and gayly lift</l>
     <l n="85">The slender herbs , pressed low by weight of rain ,</l>
     <l n="86">And drive , in joyous triumph , through the sky ,</l>
     <l n="87">White clouds , the laggard remnants of the storm .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Oh , gentle one , thy birthday sun should rise</l>
     <l n="2">Amid a chorus of the merriest birds</l>
     <l n="3">That ever sang the stars out of the sky</l>
     <l n="4">In a June morning . Rivulets should send</l>
     <l n="5">A voice of gladness from their winding paths ,</l>
     <l n="6">Deep in o'erarching grass , where playful winds ,</l>
     <l n="7">Stirring the loaded stems , should shower the dew</l>
     <l n="8">Upon the grassy water . Newly-blown</l>
     <l n="9">Roses , by thousands , to the garden-walks</l>
     <l n="10">Should tempt the loitering moth and diligent bee .</l>
     <l n="11">The longest , brightest day in all the year</l>
     <l n="12">Should be the day on which thy cheerful eyes</l>
     <l n="13">First opened on the earth , to make thy haunts</l>
     <l n="14">Fairer and gladder for thy kindly looks .</l>
     <l n="15">Thus might a poet say ; but I must bring</l>
     <l n="16">A birthday offering of an humbler strain ,</l>
     <l n="17">And yet it may not please thee less . I hold</l>
     <l n="18">That ‘ twas the fitting season for thy birth</l>
     <l n="19">When March , just ready to depart , begins</l>
     <l n="20">To soften into April . Then we have</l>
     <l n="21">The delicatest and most welcome flowers ,</l>
     <l n="22">And yet they take least heed of bitter wind</l>
     <l n="23">And lowering sky . The periwinkle then ,</l>
     <l n="24">In an hour 's sunshine , lifts her azure blooms</l>
     <l n="25">Beside the cottage-door ; within the woods</l>
     <l n="26">Tufts of ground-laurel , creeping underneath</l>
     <l n="27">The leaves of the last summer , send their sweets</l>
     <l n="28">Up to the chilly air , and , by the oak ,</l>
     <l n="29">The squirrel-cups , a graceful company ,</l>
     <l n="30">Hide in their bells , a soft aërial blue —</l>
     <l n="31">Sweet flowers , that nestle in the humblest nooks</l>
     <l n="32">And yet within whose smallest bud is wrapped</l>
     <l n="33">A world of promise ! Still the north wind breathes</l>
     <l n="34">His frost , and still the sky sheds snow and sleet ;</l>
     <l n="35">Yet ever , when the sun looks forth again ,</l>
     <l n="36">The flowers smile up to him from their low seats .</l>
     <l n="37">Well hast thou borne the bleak March day of life .</l>
     <l n="38">Its storms and its keen winds to thee have been</l>
     <l n="39">Most kindly tempered , and through all its gloom</l>
     <l n="40">There has been warmth and sunshine in thy heart ;</l>
     <l n="41">The griefs of life to thee have been like snows ,</l>
     <l n="42">That light upon the fields in early spring ,</l>
     <l n="43">Making them greener . In its milder hours ,</l>
     <l n="44">The smile of this pale season , thou hast seen</l>
     <l n="45">The glorious bloom of June , and in the note</l>
     <l n="46">Of early bird , that comes a messenger</l>
     <l n="47">From climes of endless verdure , thou hast heard</l>
     <l n="48">The choir that fills the summer woods with song .</l>
     <l n="49">Now be the hours that yet remain to thee</l>
     <l n="50">Stormy or sunny , sympathy and love ,</l>
     <l n="51">That inextinguishably dwell within</l>
     <l n="52">Thy heart , shall give a beauty and a light</l>
     <l n="53">To the most desolate moments , like the glow</l>
     <l n="54">Of a bright fireside in the wildest day ;</l>
     <l n="55">And kindly words and offices of good</l>
     <l n="56">Shall wait upon thy steps , as thou goest on ,</l>
     <l n="57">Where God shall lead thee , till thou reach the gates</l>
     <l n="58">Of a more genial season , and thy path</l>
     <l n="59">Be lost to human eye among the bowers</l>

    <head>THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER .</head>
     <l n="1">Oh River , gentle River ! gliding on</l>
     <l n="2">In silence underneath the starless sky !</l>
     <l n="3">Thine is a ministry that never rests</l>
     <l n="4">Even while the living slumber . For a time</l>
     <l n="5">The meddler , man , hath left the elements</l>
     <l n="6">In peace ; the ploughman breaks the clods no more ;</l>
     <l n="7">The miner labors not , with steel and fire ,</l>
     <l n="8">To rend the rock , and he that hews the stone ,</l>
     <l n="9">And he that fells the forest , he that guides</l>
     <l n="10">The loaded wain , and the poor animal</l>
     <l n="11">That drags it , have forgotten , for a time ,</l>
     <l n="12">Their toils , and share the quiet of the earth .</l>
     <l n="13">Thou pausest not in thine allotted task ,</l>
     <l n="14">Oh darkling River ! Through the night I hear</l>
     <l n="15">Thy wavelets rippling on the pebbly beach ;</l>
     <l n="16">I hear thy current stir the rustling sedge ,</l>
     <l n="17">That skirts thy bed ; thou intermittest not</l>
     <l n="18">Thine everlasting journey , drawing on</l>
     <l n="19">A silvery train from many a woodland spring</l>
     <l n="20">And mountain-brook . The dweller by thy side ,</l>
     <l n="21">Who moored his little boat upon thy beach ,</l>
     <l n="22">Though all the waters that upbore it then</l>
     <l n="23">Have slid away o'er night , shall find , at morn ,</l>
     <l n="24">Thy channel filled with waters freshly drawn</l>
     <l n="25">From distant cliffs , and hollows where the rill</l>
     <l n="26">Comes up amid the water-flags . All night</l>
     <l n="27">Thou givest moisture to the thirsty roots</l>
     <l n="28">Of the lithe willow and o'erhanging plane ,</l>
     <l n="29">And cherishest the herbage of thy bank ,</l>
     <l n="30">Spotted with little flowers , and sendest up</l>
     <l n="31">Perpetually the vapors from thy face ,</l>
     <l n="32">To steep the hills with dew , or darken heaven</l>
     <l n="33">With drifting clouds , that trail the shadowy shower .</l>
     <l n="34">Oh River ! darkling River ! what a voice</l>
     <l n="35">Is that thou utterest while all else is still —</l>
     <l n="36">The ancient voice that , centuries ago ,</l>
     <l n="37">Sounded between thy hills , while Rome was yet</l>
     <l n="38">A weedy solitude by Tiber 's stream !</l>
     <l n="39">How many , at this hour , along thy course ,</l>
     <l n="40">Slumber to thine eternal murmurings ,</l>
     <l n="41">That mingle with the utterance of their dreams !</l>
     <l n="42">At dead of night the child awakes and hears</l>
     <l n="43">Thy soft , familiar dashings , and is soothed ,</l>
     <l n="44">And sleeps again . An airy multitude</l>
     <l n="45">Of little echoes , all unheard by day ,</l>
     <l n="46">Faintly repeat , till morning , after thee ,</l>
     <l n="47">The story of thine endless goings forth .</l>
     <l n="48">Yet there are those who lie beside thy bed</l>
     <l n="49">For whom thou once didst rear the bowers that screen</l>
     <l n="50">Thy margin , and didst water the green fields ;</l>
     <l n="51">And now there is no night so still that they</l>
     <l n="52">Can hear thy lapse ; their slumbers , were thy voice</l>
     <l n="53">Louder than Ocean 's , it could never break .</l>
     <l n="54">For them the early violet no more</l>
     <l n="55">Opens upon thy bank , nor , for their eyes ,</l>
     <l n="56">Glitter the crimson pictures of the clouds ,</l>
     <l n="57">Upon thy bosom , when the sun goes down .</l>
     <l n="58">Their memories are abroad , the memories</l>
     <l n="59">Of those who last were gathered to the earth ,</l>
     <l n="60">Lingering within the homes in which they sat ,</l>
     <l n="61">Hovering above the paths in which they walked ,</l>
     <l n="62">Haunting them like a presence . Even now</l>
     <l n="63">They visit many a dreamer in the forms</l>
     <l n="64">They walked in , ere at last they wore the shroud .</l>
     <l n="65">And eyes there are which will not close to dream ,</l>
     <l n="66">For weeping and for thinking of the grave ,</l>
     <l n="67">The new-made grave , and the pale one within .</l>
     <l n="68">These memories and these sorrows all shall fade ,</l>
     <l n="69">And pass away , and fresher memories</l>
     <l n="70">And newer sorrows come and dwell awhile</l>
     <l n="71">Beside thy borders , and , in turn , depart .</l>
     <l n="72">On glide thy waters , till at last they flow</l>
     <l n="73">Beneath the windows of the populous town ,</l>
     <l n="74">And all night long give back the gleam of lamps ,</l>
     <l n="75">And glimmer with the trains of light that stream</l>
     <l n="76">From halls where dancers whirl . A dimmer ray</l>
     <l n="77">Touches thy surface from the silent room</l>
     <l n="78">In which they tend the sick , or gather round</l>
     <l n="79">The dying ; and a slender , steady beam</l>
     <l n="80">Comes from the little chamber , in the roof</l>
     <l n="81">Where , with a feverous crimson on her cheek ,</l>
     <l n="82">The solitary damsel , dying , too ,</l>
     <l n="83">Plies the quick needle till the stars grow pale .</l>
     <l n="84">There , close beside the haunts of revel , stand</l>
     <l n="85">The blank , unlighted windows , where the poor ,</l>
     <l n="86">In hunger and in darkness , wake till morn .</l>
     <l n="87">There , drowsily , on the half-conscious ear</l>
     <l n="88">Of the dull watchman , pacing on the wharf ,</l>
     <l n="89">Falls the soft ripple of the waves that strike</l>
     <l n="90">On the moored bark ; but guiltier listeners</l>
     <l n="91">Are nigh , the prowlers of the night , who steal</l>
     <l n="92">From shadowy nook to shadowy nook , and start</l>
     <l n="93">If other sounds than thine are in the air .</l>
     <l n="94">Oh , glide away from those abodes , that bring</l>
     <l n="95">Pollution to thy channel and make foul</l>
     <l n="96">Thy once clear current ; summon thy quick waves</l>
     <l n="97">And dimpling eddies ; linger not , but haste ,</l>
     <l n="98">With all thy waters , haste thee to the deep ,</l>
     <l n="99">There to be tossed by shifting winds and rocked</l>
     <l n="100">By that mysterious force which lives within</l>
     <l n="101">The sea 's immensity , and wields the weight</l>
     <l n="102">Of its abysses , swaying to and fro</l>
     <l n="103">The billowy mass , until the stain , at length ,</l>
     <l n="104">Shall wholly pass away , and thou regain</l>

    <head>THE CLOUD ON THE WAY .</head>
     <l n="1">See , before us , in our journey , broods a mist upon the ground ;</l>
     <l n="2">Thither leads the path we walk in , blending with that gloomy bound .</l>
     <l n="3">Never eye hath pierced its shadows to the mystery they screen ;</l>
     <l n="4">Those who once have passed within it never more on earth are seen .</l>
     <l n="5">Now it seems to stoop beside us , now at seeming distance lowers ,</l>
     <l n="6">Leaving banks that tempt us onward bright with summer-green and flowers .</l>
     <l n="7">Yet it blots the way forever ; there our journey ends at last ;</l>
     <l n="8">Into that dark cloud we enter , and are gathered to the past .</l>
     <l n="9">Thou who , in this flinty pathway , leading through a stranger-land ,</l>
     <l n="10">Passest down the rocky valley , walking with me hand in hand ,</l>
     <l n="11">Which of us shall be the soonest folded to that dim Unknown ?</l>
     <l n="12">Which shall leave the other walking in this flinty path alone ?</l>
     <l n="13">Even now I see thee shudder , and thy cheek is white with fear ,</l>
     <l n="14">And thou clingest to my side as comes that darkness sweeping near .</l>
     <l n="15">“ Here , ” thou sayst , “ the path is rugged ,</l>
     <l n="16">sown with thorns that wound the feet ;</l>
     <l n="17">But the sheltered glens are lovely , and the rivulet 's song is sweet ;</l>
     <l n="18">Roses breathe from tangled thickets ; lilies bend from ledges brown ;</l>
     <l n="19">Pleasantly between the pelting showers the sunshine gushes down ;</l>
     <l n="20">Dear are those who walk beside us , they whose looks and voices make</l>
     <l n="21">All this rugged region cheerful , till I love it for their sake .</l>
     <l n="22">Far be yet the hour that takes me where that chilly shadow lies ,</l>
     <l n="23">From the things I know and love , and from the sight of loving eyes ! ”</l>
     <l n="24">So thou murmurest , fearful one ; but see , we tread a rougher way ;</l>
     <l n="25">Fainter glow the gleams of sunshine that upon the dark rocks play ;</l>
     <l n="26">Rude winds strew the faded flowers upon the crags o'er which we pass ;</l>
     <l n="27">Banks of verdure , when we reach them , hiss with tufts of withered grass .</l>
     <l n="28">One by one we miss the voices which we loved so well to hear ;</l>
     <l n="29">One by one the kindly faces in that shadow disappear .</l>
     <l n="30">Yet upon the mist before us fix thine eyes with closer view ;</l>
     <l n="31">See , beneath its sullen skirts , the rosy morning glimmers through .</l>
     <l n="32">One whose feet the thorns have wounded passed that barrier and came back ,</l>
     <l n="33">With a glory on His footsteps lighting yet the dreary track .</l>
     <l n="34">Boldly enter where He entered ; all that seems but darkness here ,</l>
     <l n="35">When thou once hast passed beyond it , haply shall be crystal-clear .</l>
     <l n="36">Viewed from that serener realm , the walks of human life may lie ,</l>
     <l n="37">Like the page of some familiar volume , open to thine eye ;</l>
     <l n="38">Haply , from the o'erhanging shadow , thou mayst stretch an unseen hand ,</l>
     <l n="39">To support the wavering steps that print with blood the rugged land .</l>
     <l n="40">Haply , leaning o'er the pilgrim , all unweeting thou art near ,</l>
     <l n="41">Thou mayst whisper words of warning or of comfort in his ear</l>
     <l n="42">Till , beyond the border where that brooding mystery bars the sight ,</l>
     <l n="43">Those whom thou hast fondly cherished stand with thee in peace and light .</l>

    <head>THE CONSTELLATIONS .</head>
     <l n="1">O Constellations of the early night ,</l>
     <l n="2">That sparkled brighter as the twilight died ,</l>
     <l n="3">And made the darkness glorious ! I have seen</l>
     <l n="4">Your rays grow dim upon the horizon 's edge ,</l>
     <l n="5">And sink behind the mountains . I have seen</l>
     <l n="6">The great Orion , with his jewelled belt ,</l>
     <l n="7">That large-limbed warrior of the skies , go down</l>
     <l n="8">Into the gloom . Beside him sank a crowd</l>
     <l n="9">Of shining ones . I look in vain to find</l>
     <l n="10">The group of sister-stars , which mothers love</l>
     <l n="11">To show their wondering babes , the gentle Seven .</l>
     <l n="12">Along the desert space mine eyes in vain</l>
     <l n="13">Seek the resplendent cressets which the Twins</l>
     <l n="14">Uplifted in their ever-youthful hands .</l>
     <l n="15">The streaming tresses of the Egyptian Queen</l>
     <l n="16">Spangle the heavens no more . The Virgin trails</l>
     <l n="17">No more her glittering garments through the blue .</l>
     <l n="18">Gone ! all are gone ! and the forsaken Night ,</l>
     <l n="19">With all her winds , in all her dreary wastes ,</l>
     <l n="20">Sighs that they shine upon her face no more</l>
     <l n="21">Now only here and there a little star</l>
     <l n="22">Looks forth alone . Ah me ! I know them not ,</l>
     <l n="23">Those dim successors of the numberless host</l>
     <l n="24">That filled the heavenly fields , and flung to earth</l>
     <l n="25">Their quivering fires . And now the middle watch</l>
     <l n="26">Betwixt the eve and morn is past , and still</l>
     <l n="27">The darkness gains upon the sky , and still</l>
     <l n="28">It closes round my way . Shall , then , the Night</l>
     <l n="29">Grow starless in her later hours ? Have these</l>
     <l n="30">No train of flaming watchers , that shall mark</l>
     <l n="31">Their coming and farewell ? O Sons of Light !</l>
     <l n="32">Have ye then left me ere the dawn of day</l>
     <l n="33">To grope along my journey sad and faint ?</l>
     <l n="34">Thus I complained , and from the darkness round</l>
     <l n="35">A voice replied — was it indeed a voice ,</l>
     <l n="36">Or seeming accents of a waking dream</l>
     <l n="37">Heard by the inner ear ? But thus it said :</l>
     <l n="38">O Traveller of the Night ! thine eyes are dim</l>
     <l n="39">With watching ; and the mists , that chill the vale</l>
     <l n="40">Down which thy feet are passing , hide from view</l>
     <l n="41">The ever-burning stars . It is thy sight</l>
     <l n="42">That is so dark , and not the heavens . Thine eyes ,</l>
     <l n="43">Were they but clear , would see a fiery host</l>
     <l n="44">Above thee ; Hercules , with flashing mace ,</l>
     <l n="45">The Lyre with silver chords , the Swan uppoised</l>
     <l n="46">On gleaming wings , the Dolphin gliding on</l>
     <l n="47">With glistening scales , and that poetic steed ,</l>
     <l n="48">With beamy mane , whose hoof struck out from earth</l>
     <l n="49">The fount of Hippocrene , and many more ,</l>
     <l n="50">Fair clustered splendors , with whose rays the Night</l>
     <l n="51">Shall close her march in glory , ere she yield ,</l>
     <l n="52">To the young Day , the great earth steeped in dew .</l>
     <l n="53">So spake the monitor , and I perceived</l>
     <l n="54">How vain were my repinings , and my thought</l>
     <l n="55">Went backward to the vanished years and all</l>
     <l n="56">The good and great who came and passed with them ,</l>
     <l n="57">And knew that ever would the years to come</l>
     <l n="58">Bring with them , in their course , the good and great ,</l>
     <l n="59">Lights of the world , though , to my clouded sight ,</l>
     <l n="60">Their rays might seem but dim , or reach me not .</l>

    <head>SELLA .</head>
     <l n="1">Hear now a legend of the days of old —</l>
     <l n="2">The days when there were goodly marvels yet ,</l>
     <l n="3">When man to man gave willing faith , and loved</l>
     <l n="4">A tale the better that ‘ twas wild and strange .</l>
     <l n="5">Beside a pleasant dwelling ran a brook</l>
     <l n="6">Scudding along a narrow channel , paved</l>
     <l n="7">With green and yellow pebbles ; yet full clear</l>
     <l n="8">Its waters were , and colorless and cool ,</l>
     <l n="9">As fresh from granite rocks . A maiden oft</l>
     <l n="10">Stood at the open window , leaning out ,</l>
     <l n="11">And listening to the sound the water made ,</l>
     <l n="12">A sweet , eternal murmur , still the same ,</l>
     <l n="13">And not the same ; and oft , as spring came on ,</l>
     <l n="14">She gathered violets from its fresh moist bank ,</l>
     <l n="15">To place within her bower , and when the herbs</l>
     <l n="16">Of summer drooped beneath the mid-day sun ,</l>
     <l n="17">She sat within the shade of a great rock ,</l>
     <l n="18">Dreamily listening to the streamlet 's song .</l>
     <l n="19">Ripe were the maiden 's years ; her stature showed</l>
     <l n="20">Womanly beauty , and her clear , calm eye</l>
     <l n="21">Was bright with venturous spirit , yet her face</l>
     <l n="22">Was passionless , like those by sculptor graved</l>
     <l n="23">For niches in a temple . Lovers oft</l>
     <l n="24">Had wooed her , but she only laughed at love ,</l>
     <l n="25">And wondered at the silly things they said .</l>
     <l n="26">‘ Twas her delight to wander where wild-vines</l>
     <l n="27">O'erhang the river 's brim , to climb the path</l>
     <l n="28">Of woodland streamlet to its mountain-springs ,</l>
     <l n="29">To sit by gleaming wells and mark below</l>
     <l n="30">The image of the rushes on its edge ,</l>
     <l n="31">And , deep beyond , the trailing clouds that slid</l>
     <l n="32">Across the fair blue space . No little fount</l>
     <l n="33">Stole forth from hanging rock , or in the side</l>
     <l n="34">Of hollow dell , or under roots of oak ;</l>
     <l n="35">No rill came trickling , with a stripe of green ,</l>
     <l n="36">Down the bare hill , that to this maiden 's eye</l>
     <l n="37">Was not familiar . Often did the banks</l>
     <l n="38">Of river or of sylvan lakelet hear</l>
     <l n="39">The dip of oars with which the maiden rowed</l>
     <l n="40">Her shallop , pushing ever from the prow</l>
     <l n="41">A crowd of long , light ripples toward the shore .</l>
     <l n="42">Two brothers had the maiden , and she thought ,</l>
     <l n="43">Within herself : “ I would I were like them ;</l>
     <l n="44">For then I might go forth alone , to trace</l>
     <l n="45">The mighty rivers downward to the sea ,</l>
     <l n="46">And upward to the brooks that , through the year ,</l>
     <l n="47">Prattle to the cool valleys . I would know</l>
     <l n="48">What races drink their waters ; how their chiefs</l>
     <l n="49">Bear rule , and how men worship there , and how</l>
     <l n="50">They build , and to what quaint device they frame ,</l>
     <l n="51">Where sea and river meet , their stately ships ;</l>
     <l n="52">What flowers are in their gardens , and what trees</l>
     <l n="53">Bear fruit within their orchards ; in what garb</l>
     <l n="54">Their bowmen meet on holidays , and how</l>
     <l n="55">Their maidens bind the waist and braid the hair .</l>
     <l n="56">Here , on these hills , my father 's house o'erlooks</l>
     <l n="57">Broad pastures grazed by flocks and herds , but there</l>
     <l n="58">I hear they sprinkle the great plains with corn</l>
     <l n="59">And watch its springing up , and when the green</l>
     <l n="60">Is changed to gold , they cut the stems and bring</l>
     <l n="61">The harvest in , and give the nations bread .</l>
     <l n="62">And there they hew the quarry into shafts ,</l>
     <l n="63">And pile up glorious temples from the rock ,</l>
     <l n="64">And chisel the rude stones to shapes of men .</l>
     <l n="65">All this I pine to see , and would have seen ,</l>
     <l n="66">But that I am a woman , long ago . ”</l>
     <l n="67">Thus in her wanderings did the maiden dream ,</l>
     <l n="68">Until , at length , one morn in early spring ,</l>
     <l n="69">When all the glistening fields lay white with frost ,</l>
     <l n="70">She came half breathless where her mother sat :</l>
     <l n="71">“ See , mother dear , ” she said , “ what I have found ,</l>
     <l n="72">Upon our rivulet 's bank ; two slippers , white</l>
     <l n="73">As the midwinter snow , and spangled o'er</l>
     <l n="74">With twinkling points , like stars , and on the edge</l>
     <l n="75">My name is wrought in silver ; read , I pray ,</l>
     <l n="76">Sella , the name thy mother , now in heaven ,</l>
     <l n="77">Gave at my birth ; and sure , they fit my feet ! ”</l>
     <l n="78">“ A dainty pair , ” the prudent matron said ,</l>
     <l n="79">“ But thine they are not . We must lay them by</l>
     <l n="80">For those whose careless hands have left them here ;</l>
     <l n="81">Or haply they were placed beside the brook</l>
     <l n="82">To be a snare . I cannot see thy name</l>
     <l n="83">Upon the border — only characters</l>
     <l n="84">Of mystic look and dim are there , like signs</l>
     <l n="85">Of some strange art ; nay , daughter , wear them not . ”</l>
     <l n="86">Then Sella hung the slippers in the porch</l>
     <l n="87">Of that broad rustic lodge , and all who passed</l>
     <l n="88">Admired their fair contexture , but none knew</l>
     <l n="89">Who left them by the brook . And now , at length ,</l>
     <l n="90">May , with her flowers and singing birds , had gone ,</l>
     <l n="91">And on bright streams and into deep wells shone</l>
     <l n="92">The high , midsummer sun . One day , at noon ,</l>
     <l n="93">Sella was missed from the accustomed meal .</l>
     <l n="94">They sought her in her favorite haunts , they looked</l>
     <l n="95">By the great rock and far along the stream ,</l>
     <l n="96">And shouted in the sounding woods her name .</l>
     <l n="97">Night came , and forth the sorrowing household went</l>
     <l n="98">With torches over the wide pasture-grounds ,</l>
     <l n="99">To pool and thicket , marsh and briery dell ,</l>
     <l n="100">And solitary valley far away .</l>
     <l n="101">The morning came , and Sella was not found .</l>
     <l n="102">The sun climbed high ; they sought her still ; the noon ,</l>
     <l n="103">The hot and silent noon , heard Sella 's name ,</l>
     <l n="104">Uttered with a despairing cry , to wastes</l>
     <l n="105">O'er which the eagle hovered . As the sun</l>
     <l n="106">Stooped toward the amber west to bring the close</l>
     <l n="107">Of that sad second day , and , with red eyes ,</l>
     <l n="108">The mother sat within her home alone ,</l>
     <l n="109">Sella was at her side . A shriek of joy</l>
     <l n="110">Broke the sad silence ; glad , warm tears were shed ,</l>
     <l n="111">And words of gladness uttered . “ Oh , forgive , ”</l>
     <l n="112">The maiden said , “ that I could e'er forget</l>
     <l n="113">Thy wishes for a moment . I just tried</l>
     <l n="114">The slippers on , amazed to see them shaped</l>
     <l n="115">So fairly to my feet , when , all at once ,</l>
     <l n="116">I felt my steps upborne and hurried on</l>
     <l n="117">Almost as if with wings . A strange delight ,</l>
     <l n="118">Blent with a thrill of fear , o'ermastered me ,</l>
     <l n="119">And , ere I knew , my splashing steps were set</l>
     <l n="120">Within the rivulet 's pebbly bed , and I</l>
     <l n="121">Was rushing down the current . By my side</l>
     <l n="122">Tripped one as beautiful as ever looked</l>
     <l n="123">From white clouds in a dream ; and , as we ran ,</l>
     <l n="124">She talked with musical voice and sweetly laughed .</l>
     <l n="125">Gayly we leaped the crag and swam the pool ,</l>
     <l n="126">And swept with dimpling eddies round the rock ,</l>
     <l n="127">And glided between shady meadow-banks .</l>
     <l n="128">The streamlet , broadening as we went , became</l>
     <l n="129">A swelling river , and we shot along</l>
     <l n="130">By stately towns , and under leaning masts</l>
     <l n="131">Of gallant barks , nor lingered by the shore</l>
     <l n="132">Of blooming gardens ; onward , onward still ,</l>
     <l n="133">The same strong impulse bore me , till , at last ,</l>
     <l n="134">We entered the great deep , and passed below</l>
     <l n="135">His billows , into boundless spaces , lit</l>
     <l n="136">With a green sunshine . Here were mighty groves</l>
     <l n="137">Far down the ocean-valleys , and between</l>
     <l n="138">Lay what might seem fair meadows , softly tinged</l>
     <l n="139">With orange and with crimson . Here arose</l>
     <l n="140">Tall stems , that , rooted in the depths below ,</l>
     <l n="141">Swung idly with the motions of the sea ;</l>
     <l n="142">And here were shrubberies in whose mazy screen</l>
     <l n="143">The creatures of the deep made haunt . My friend</l>
     <l n="144">Named the strange growths , the pretty coralline ,</l>
     <l n="145">The dulse with crimson leaves , and , streaming far ,</l>
     <l n="146">Sea-thong and sea-lace . Here the tangle spread</l>
     <l n="147">Its broad , thick fronds , with pleasant bowers beneath ;</l>
     <l n="148">And oft we trod a waste of pearly sands ,</l>
     <l n="149">Spotted with rosy shells , and thence looked in</l>
     <l n="150">At caverns of the sea whose rock-roofed halls</l>
     <l n="151">Lay in blue twilight . As we moved along ,</l>
     <l n="152">The dwellers of the deep , in mighty herds ,</l>
     <l n="153">Passed by us , reverently they passed us by ,</l>
     <l n="154">Long trains of dolphins rolling through the brine ,</l>
     <l n="155">Huge whales , that drew the waters after them ,</l>
     <l n="156">A torrent-stream , and hideous hammer-sharks ,</l>
     <l n="157">Chasing their prey . I shuddered as they came ;</l>
     <l n="158">Gently they turned aside and gave us room . ”</l>
     <l n="159">Hereat broke in the mother : “ Sella dear ,</l>
     <l n="160">This is a dream , the idlest , vainest dream . ”</l>
     <l n="161">“ Nay , mother , nay ; behold this sea-green scarf ,</l>
     <l n="162">Woven of such threads as never human hand</l>
     <l n="163">Twined from the distaff . She who led my way</l>
     <l n="164">Through the great waters , bade me wear it home ,</l>
     <l n="165">A token that my tale is true . ‘ And keep , ’</l>
     <l n="166">She said , ‘ the slippers thou hast found , for thou ,</l>
     <l n="167">When shod with them , shalt be like one of us ,</l>
     <l n="168">With power to walk at will the ocean-floor ,</l>
     <l n="169">Among its monstrous creatures , unafraid ,</l>
     <l n="170">And feel no longing for the air of heaven</l>
     <l n="171">To fill thy lungs , and send the warm , red blood</l>
     <l n="172">Along thy veins . But thou shalt pass the hours</l>
     <l n="173">In dances with the sea-nymphs , or go forth ,</l>
     <l n="174">To look into the mysteries of the abyss</l>
     <l n="175">Where never plummet reached . And thou shalt sleep</l>
     <l n="176">Thy weariness away on downy banks</l>
     <l n="177">Of sea-moss , where the pulses of the tide</l>
     <l n="178">Shall gently lift thy hair , or thou shalt float</l>
     <l n="179">On the soft currents that go forth and wind</l>
     <l n="180">From isle to isle , and wander through the sea . ’</l>
     <l n="181">“ So spake my fellow-voyager , her words</l>
     <l n="182">Sounding like wavelets on a summer shore ,</l>
     <l n="183">And then we stopped beside a hanging rock ,</l>
     <l n="184">With a smooth beach of white sands at its foot ,</l>
     <l n="185">Where three fair creatures like herself were set</l>
     <l n="186">At their sea-banquet , crisp and juicy stalks ,</l>
     <l n="187">Culled from the ocean 's meadows , and the sweet</l>
     <l n="188">Midrib of pleasant leaves , and golden fruits</l>
     <l n="189">Dropped from the trees that edge the southern isles ,</l>
     <l n="190">And gathered on the waves . Kindly they prayed</l>
     <l n="191">That I would share their meal , and I partook</l>
     <l n="192">With eager appetite , for long had been</l>
     <l n="193">My journey , and I left the spot refreshed .</l>
     <l n="194">“ And then we wandered off amid the groves</l>
     <l n="195">Of coral loftier than the growths of earth ;</l>
     <l n="196">The mightiest cedar lifts no trunk like theirs ,</l>
     <l n="197">So huge , so high toward heaven , nor overhangs</l>
     <l n="198">Alleys and bowers so dim . We moved between</l>
     <l n="199">Pinnacles of black rock , which , from beneath ,</l>
     <l n="200">Molten by inner fires , so said my guide ,</l>
     <l n="201">Gushed long ago into the hissing brine ,</l>
     <l n="202">That quenched and hardened them , and now they stand</l>
     <l n="203">Motionless in the currents of the sea</l>
     <l n="204">That part and flow around them . As we went ,</l>
     <l n="205">We looked into the hollows of the abyss ,</l>
     <l n="206">To which the never-resting waters sweep</l>
     <l n="207">The skeletons of sharks , the long white spines</l>
     <l n="208">Of narwhal and of dolphin , bones of men</l>
     <l n="209">Shipwrecked , and mighty ribs of foundered barks .</l>
     <l n="210">Down the blue pits we looked , and hastened on .</l>
     <l n="211">“ But beautiful the fountains of the sea</l>
     <l n="212">Sprang upward from its bed : the silvery jets</l>
     <l n="213">Shot branching far into the azure brine ,</l>
     <l n="214">And where they mingled with it , the great deep</l>
     <l n="215">Quivered and shook , as shakes the glimmering air</l>
     <l n="216">Ahove a furnace . So we wandered through</l>
     <l n="217">The mighty world of waters , till at length</l>
     <l n="218">I wearied of its wonders , and my heart</l>
     <l n="219">Began to yearn for my dear mountain-home .</l>
     <l n="220">I prayed my gentle guide to lead me back</l>
     <l n="221">To the upper air . ‘ A glorious realm , ’ I said ,</l>
     <l n="222">‘ Is this thou openest to me ; but I stray</l>
     <l n="223">Bewildered in its vastness ; these strange sights</l>
     <l n="224">And this strange light oppress me . I must see</l>
     <l n="225">The faces that I love , or I shall die . ’</l>
     <l n="226">“ She took my hand , and , darting through the waves</l>
     <l n="227">Brought me to where the stream , by which we came ,</l>
     <l n="228">Rushed into the main ocean . Then began</l>
     <l n="229">A slower journey upward . Wearily</l>
     <l n="230">We breasted the strong current , climbing through</l>
     <l n="231">The rapids , tossing high their foam . The night</l>
     <l n="232">Came down , and in the clear depth of a pool ,</l>
     <l n="233">Edged with o'erhanging rock , we took our rest</l>
     <l n="234">Till morning ; and I slept , and dreamed of home</l>
     <l n="235">And thee . A pleasant sight the morning showed ;</l>
     <l n="236">The green fields of this upper world , the herds</l>
     <l n="237">That grazed the bank , the light on the red clouds ,</l>
     <l n="238">The trees , with all their host of trembling leaves ,</l>
     <l n="239">Lifting and lowering to the restless wind</l>
     <l n="240">Their branches . As I woke , I saw them all</l>
     <l n="241">From the clear stream ; yet strangely was my heart</l>
     <l n="242">Parted between the watery world and this ,</l>
     <l n="243">And as we journeyed upward , oft I thought</l>
     <l n="244">Of marvels I had seen , and stopped and turned ,</l>
     <l n="245">And lingered , till I thought of thee again ;</l>
     <l n="246">And then again I turned and clambered up</l>
     <l n="247">The rivulet 's murmuring path , until we came</l>
     <l n="248">Beside the cottage-door . There tenderly</l>
     <l n="249">My fair conductor kissed me , and I saw</l>
     <l n="250">Her face no more . I took the slippers off .</l>
     <l n="251">Oh ! with what deep delight my lungs drew in</l>
     <l n="252">The air of heaven again , and with what joy</l>
     <l n="253">I felt my blood bound with its former glow ;</l>
     <l n="254">And now I never leave thy side again ! ”</l>
     <l n="255">So spoke the maiden Sella , with large tears</l>
     <l n="256">Standing in her mild eyes , and in the porch</l>
     <l n="257">Replaced the slippers . Autumn came and went ;</l>
     <l n="258">The winter passed ; another summer warmed</l>
     <l n="259">The quiet pools ; another autumn tinged</l>
     <l n="260">The grape with red , yet while it hung unplucked ,</l>
     <l n="261">The mother ere her time was carried forth</l>
     <l n="262">To sleep among the solitary hills .</l>
     <l n="263">A long , still sadness settled on that home</l>
     <l n="264">Among the mountains . The stern father there</l>
     <l n="265">Wept with his children , and grew soft of heart ,</l>
     <l n="266">And Sella , and the brothers twain , and one</l>
     <l n="267">Younger than they , a sister fair and shy ,</l>
     <l n="268">Strewed the new grave with flowers , and round it set</l>
     <l n="269">Shrubs that all winter held their lively green .</l>
     <l n="270">Time passed ; the grief with which their hearts were wrung</l>
     <l n="271">Waned to a gentle sorrow . Sella , now ,</l>
     <l n="272">Was often absent from the patriarch 's board ;</l>
     <l n="273">The slippers hung no longer in the porch ;</l>
     <l n="274">And sometimes after summer nights her couch</l>
     <l n="275">Was found unpressed at dawn , and well they knew</l>
     <l n="276">That she was wandering with the race who make</l>
     <l n="277">Their dwelling in the waters . Oft her looks</l>
     <l n="278">Fixed on blank space , and oft the ill-suited word</l>
     <l n="279">Told that her thoughts were far away . In vain</l>
     <l n="280">Her brothers reasoned with her tenderly :</l>
     <l n="281">“ Oh leave not thus thy kindred ! ” so they prayed ;</l>
     <l n="282">“ Dear Sella , now that she who gave us birth</l>
     <l n="283">Is in her grave , oh go not hence , to seek</l>
     <l n="284">Companions in that strange cold realm below ,</l>
     <l n="285">For which God made not us nor thee , but stay</l>
     <l n="286">To be the grace and glory of our home . ”</l>
     <l n="287">She looked at them with those mild eyes and wept ,</l>
     <l n="288">But said no word in answer , nor refrained</l>
     <l n="289">From those mysterious wanderings that filled</l>
     <l n="290">Their loving hearts with a perpetual pain .</l>
     <l n="291">And now the younger sister , fair and shy ,</l>
     <l n="292">Had grown to early womanhood , and one</l>
     <l n="293">Who loved her well had wooed her for his bride ,</l>
     <l n="294">And she had named the wedding-day . The herd</l>
     <l n="295">Had given its fatlings for the marriage-feast ;</l>
     <l n="296">The roadside garden and the secret glen</l>
     <l n="297">Were rifled of their sweetest flowers to twine</l>
     <l n="298">The door-posts , and to lie among the locks</l>
     <l n="299">Of maids , the wedding-guests , and from the boughs</l>
     <l n="300">Of mountain-orchards had the fairest fruit</l>
     <l n="301">Been plucked to glisten in the canisters .</l>
     <l n="302">Then , trooping over hill and valley , came</l>
     <l n="303">Matron and maid , grave men and smiling youths ,</l>
     <l n="304">Like swallows gathering for their autumn flight ,</l>
     <l n="305">In costumes of that simpler age they came ,</l>
     <l n="306">That gave the limbs large play , and wrapped the form</l>
     <l n="307">In easy folds , yet bright with glowing hues</l>
     <l n="308">As suited holidays . All hastened on</l>
     <l n="309">To that glad bridal . There already stood</l>
     <l n="310">The priest prepared to say the spousal rite ,</l>
     <l n="311">And there the harpers in due order sat ,</l>
     <l n="312">And there the singers . Sella , midst them all ,</l>
     <l n="313">Moved strangely and serenely beautiful ,</l>
     <l n="314">With clear blue eyes , fair locks , and brow and cheek</l>
     <l n="315">Colorless as the lily of the lakes ,</l>
     <l n="316">Yet moulded to such shape as artists give</l>
     <l n="317">To beings of immortal youth . Her hands</l>
     <l n="318">Had decked her sister for the bridal hour</l>
     <l n="319">With chosen flowers , and lawn whose delicate threads</l>
     <l n="320">Vied with the spider 's spinning . There she stood</l>
     <l n="321">With such a gentle pleasure in her looks</l>
     <l n="322">As might beseem a river-nymph 's soft eyes</l>
     <l n="323">Gracing a bridal of the race whose flocks</l>
     <l n="324">Were pastured on the borders of her stream .</l>
     <l n="325">She smiled , but from that calm sweet face the smile</l>
     <l n="326">Was soon to pass away . That very morn</l>
     <l n="327">The elder of the brothers , as he stood</l>
     <l n="328">Upon the hillside , had beheld the maid ,</l>
     <l n="329">Emerging from the channel of the brook ,</l>
     <l n="330">With three fresh water-lilies in her hand ,</l>
     <l n="331">Wring dry her dripping locks , and in a cleft</l>
     <l n="332">Of hanging rock , beside a screen of boughs ,</l>
     <l n="333">Bestow the spangled slippers . None before</l>
     <l n="334">Had known where Sella hid them . Then she laid</l>
     <l n="335">The light-brown tresses smooth , and in them twined</l>
     <l n="336">The lily-buds , and hastily drew forth</l>
     <l n="337">And threw across her shoulders a light robe</l>
     <l n="338">Wrought for the bridal , and with bounding steps</l>
     <l n="339">Ran toward the lodge . The youth beheld and marked</l>
     <l n="340">The spot and slowly followed from afar .</l>
     <l n="341">Now had the marriage-rite been said ; the bride</l>
     <l n="342">Stood in the blush that from her burning cheek</l>
     <l n="343">Glowed down the alabaster neck , as morn</l>
     <l n="344">Crimsons the pearly heaven half-way to the west .</l>
     <l n="345">At once the harpers struck their chords ; a gush</l>
     <l n="346">Of music broke upon the air ; the youths</l>
     <l n="347">All started to the dance . Among them moved</l>
     <l n="348">The queenly Sella with a grace that seemed</l>
     <l n="349">Caught from the swaying of the summer sea .</l>
     <l n="350">The young drew forth the elders to the dance ,</l>
     <l n="351">Who joined it half abashed , but when they felt</l>
     <l n="352">The joyous music tingling in their veins ,</l>
     <l n="353">They called for quaint old measures , which they trod</l>
     <l n="354">As gayly as in youth , and far abroad</l>
     <l n="355">Came through the open windows cheerful shouts</l>
     <l n="356">And bursts of laughter . They who heard the sound</l>
     <l n="357">Upon the mountain footpaths paused and said ,</l>
     <l n="358">“ A merry wedding . ” Lovers stole away</l>
     <l n="359">That sunny afternoon to bowers that edged</l>
     <l n="360">The garden-walks , and what was whispered there</l>
     <l n="361">The lovers of these later times can guess .</l>
     <l n="362">Meanwhile the brothers , when the merry din</l>
     <l n="363">Was loudest , stole to where the slippers lay ,</l>
     <l n="364">And took them thence , and followed down the brook</l>
     <l n="365">To where a little rapid rushed between</l>
     <l n="366">Its borders of smooth rock , and dropped them in .</l>
     <l n="367">The rivulet , as they touched its face , flung up</l>
     <l n="368">Its small bright waves like hands , and seemed to take</l>
     <l n="369">The prize with eagerness and draw it down .</l>
     <l n="370">They , gleaming through the waters as they went ,</l>
     <l n="371">And striking with light sound the shining stones ,</l>
     <l n="372">Slid down the stream . The brothers looked and watched ,</l>
     <l n="373">And listened with full beating hearts , till now</l>
     <l n="374">The sight and sound had passed , and silently</l>
     <l n="375">And half repentant hastened to the lodge .</l>
     <l n="376">The sun was near his set ; the music rang</l>
     <l n="377">Within the dwelling still , but the mirth waned ;</l>
     <l n="378">For groups of guests were sauntering toward their homes</l>
     <l n="379">Across the fields , and far , on hillside paths ,</l>
     <l n="380">Gleamed the white robes of maidens . Sella grew</l>
     <l n="381">Weary of the long merriment ; she thought</l>
     <l n="382">Of her still haunts beneath the soundless sea ,</l>
     <l n="383">And all unseen withdrew and sought the cleft</l>
     <l n="384">Where she had laid the slippers . They were gone !</l>
     <l n="385">She searched the brookside near , yet found them not .</l>
     <l n="386">Then her heart sank within her , and she ran</l>
     <l n="387">Wildly from place to place , and once again</l>
     <l n="388">She searched the secret cleft , and next she stooped</l>
     <l n="389">And with spread palms felt carefully beneath</l>
     <l n="390">The tufted herbs and bushes , and again ,</l>
     <l n="391">And yet again , she searched the rocky cleft .</l>
     <l n="392">“ Who could have taken them ? ” That question cleared</l>
     <l n="393">The mystery . She remembered suddenly</l>
     <l n="394">That when the dance was in its gayest whirl ,</l>
     <l n="395">Her brothers were not seen , and when , at length ,</l>
     <l n="396">They reappeared , the elder joined the sports</l>
     <l n="397">With shouts of boisterous mirth , and from her eye</l>
     <l n="398">The younger shrank in silence . “ Now , I know</l>
     <l n="399">The guilty ones , ” she said , and left the spot ,</l>
     <l n="400">And stood before the youths with such a look</l>
     <l n="401">Of anguish and reproach that well they knew</l>
     <l n="402">Her thought , and almost wished the deed undone .</l>
     <l n="403">Frankly they owned the charge : “ And pardon us ;</l>
     <l n="404">We did it all in love ; we could not bear</l>
     <l n="405">That the cold world of waters and the strange</l>
     <l n="406">Beings that dwell within it should beguile</l>
     <l n="407">Our sister from us . ” Then they told her all ;</l>
     <l n="408">How they had seen her stealthily bestow</l>
     <l n="409">The slippers in the cleft , and how by stealth</l>
     <l n="410">They took them thence and bore them down the brook ,</l>
     <l n="411">And dropped them in , and how the eager waves</l>
     <l n="412">Gathered and drew them down ; but at that word</l>
     <l n="413">The maiden shrieked — a broken-hearted shriek —</l>
     <l n="414">And all who heard it shuddered and turned pale</l>
     <l n="415">At the despairing cry , and “ They are gone , ”</l>
     <l n="416">She said , “ gone — gone forever ! Cruel ones !</l>
     <l n="417">‘ Tis you who shut me out eternally</l>
     <l n="418">From that serener world which I had learned</l>
     <l n="419">To love so well . Why took ye not my life ?</l>
     <l n="420">Ye cannot know what ye have done ! ” She spake</l>
     <l n="421">And hurried to her chamber , and the guests</l>
     <l n="422">Who yet had lingered silently withdrew .</l>
     <l n="423">The brothers followed to the maiden 's bower ,</l>
     <l n="424">But with a calm demeanor , as they came ,</l>
     <l n="425">She met them at the door . “ The wrong is great , ”</l>
     <l n="426">She said , “ that ye have done me , but no power</l>
     <l n="427">Have ye to make it less , nor yet to soothe</l>
     <l n="428">My sorrow ; I shall bear it as I may ,</l>
     <l n="429">The better for the hours that I have passed</l>
     <l n="430">In the calm region of the middle sea .</l>
     <l n="431">Go , then . I need you not . ” They , overawed ,</l>
     <l n="432">Withdrew from that grave presence . Then her tears</l>
     <l n="433">Broke forth a flood , as when the August cloud ,</l>
     <l n="434">Darkening beside the mountain , suddenly</l>
     <l n="435">Melts into streams of rain . That weary night</l>
     <l n="436">She paced her chamber , murmuring as she walked ,</l>
     <l n="437">“ O peaceful region of the middle sea !</l>
     <l n="438">O azure bowers and grots , in which I loved</l>
     <l n="439">To roam and rest ! Am I to long for you ,</l>
     <l n="440">And think how strangely beautiful ye are ,</l>
     <l n="441">Yet never see you more ? And dearer yet ,</l>
     <l n="442">Ye gentle ones in whose sweet company</l>
     <l n="443">I trod the shelly pavements of the deep ,</l>
     <l n="444">And swam its currents , creatures with calm eyes</l>
     <l n="445">Looking the tenderest love , and voices soft</l>
     <l n="446">As ripple of light waves along the shore ,</l>
     <l n="447">Uttering the tenderest words ! Oh ! ne'er again</l>
     <l n="448">Shall I , in your mild aspects , read the peace</l>
     <l n="449">That dwells within , and vainly shall I pine</l>
     <l n="450">To hear your sweet low voices . Haply now</l>
     <l n="451">Ye miss me in your deep-sea home , and think</l>
     <l n="452">Of me with pity , as of one condemned</l>
     <l n="453">To haunt this upper world , with its harsh sounds</l>
     <l n="454">And glaring lights , its withering heats , its frosts ,</l>
     <l n="455">Cruel and killing , its delirious strifes ,</l>
     <l n="456">And all its feverish passions , till I die . ”</l>
     <l n="457">So mourned she the long night , and when the morn</l>
     <l n="458">Brightened the mountains , from her lattice looked</l>
     <l n="459">The maiden on a world that was to her</l>
     <l n="460">A desolate and dreary waste . That day</l>
     <l n="461">She passed in wandering by the brook that oft</l>
     <l n="462">Had been her pathway to the sea , and still</l>
     <l n="463">Seemed , with its cheerful murmur , to invite</l>
     <l n="464">Her footsteps thither . “ Well mayst thou rejoice ,</l>
     <l n="465">Fortunate stream ! ” she said , “ and dance along</l>
     <l n="466">Thy bed , and make thy course one ceaseless strain</l>
     <l n="467">Of music , for thou journeyest toward the deep ,</l>
     <l n="468">To which I shall return no more . ” The night</l>
     <l n="469">Brought her to her lone chamber , and she knelt</l>
     <l n="470">And prayed , with many tears , to Him whose hand</l>
     <l n="471">Touches the wounded heart and it is healed .</l>
     <l n="472">With prayer there came new thoughts and new desires .</l>
     <l n="473">She asked for patience and a deeper love</l>
     <l n="474">For those with whom her lot was henceforth cast ,</l>
     <l n="475">And that in acts of mercy she might lose</l>
     <l n="476">The sense of her own sorrow . When she rose</l>
     <l n="477">A weight was lifted from her heart . She sought</l>
     <l n="478">Her couch , and slept a long and peaceful sleep .</l>
     <l n="479">At morn she woke to a new life . Her days</l>
     <l n="480">Henceforth were given to quiet tasks of good</l>
     <l n="481">In the great world . Men hearkened to her words ,</l>
     <l n="482">And wondered at their wisdom and obeyed ,</l>
     <l n="483">And saw how beautiful the law of love</l>
     <l n="484">Can make the cares and toils of daily life .</l>
     <l n="485">Still did she love to haunt the springs and brooks</l>
     <l n="486">As in her cheerful childhood , and she taught</l>
     <l n="487">The skill to pierce the soil and meet the veins</l>
     <l n="488">Of clear cold water winding underneath ,</l>
     <l n="489">And call them forth to daylight . From afar</l>
     <l n="490">She bade men bring the rivers on long rows</l>
     <l n="491">Of pillared arches to the sultry town ,</l>
     <l n="492">And on the hot air of the summer fling</l>
     <l n="493">The spray of dashing fountains . To relieve</l>
     <l n="494">Their weary hands , she showed them how to tame</l>
     <l n="495">The rushing stream , and make him drive the wheel</l>
     <l n="496">That whirls the humming millstone and that wields</l>
     <l n="497">The ponderous sledge . The waters of the cloud ,</l>
     <l n="498">That drench the hillside in the time of rains ,</l>
     <l n="499">Were gathered , at her bidding , into pools ,</l>
     <l n="500">And in the months of drought led forth again ,</l>
     <l n="501">In glimmering rivulets , to refresh the vales ,</l>
     <l n="502">Till the sky darkened with returning showers .</l>
     <l n="503">So passed her life , a long and blameless life ,</l>
     <l n="504">And far and near her name was named with love</l>
     <l n="505">And reverence . Still she kept , as age came on ,</l>
     <l n="506">Her stately presence ; still her eyes looked forth</l>
     <l n="507">From under their calm brows as brightly clear</l>
     <l n="508">As the transparent wells by which she sat</l>
     <l n="509">So oft in childhood . Still she kept her fair</l>
     <l n="510">Unwrinkled features , though her locks were white .</l>
     <l n="511">A hundred times had summer , since her birth ,</l>
     <l n="512">Opened the water-lily on the lakes ,</l>
     <l n="513">So old traditions tell , before she died .</l>
     <l n="514">A hundred cities mourned her , and her death</l>
     <l n="515">Saddened the pastoral valleys . By the brook ,</l>
     <l n="516">That bickering ran beside the cottage-door</l>
     <l n="517">Where she was born , they reared her monument .</l>
     <l n="518">Ere long the current parted and flowed round</l>
     <l n="519">The marble base , forming a little isle ,</l>
     <l n="520">And there the flowers that love the running stream ,</l>
     <l n="521">Iris and orchis , and the cardinal-flower ,</l>
     <l n="522">Crowded and hung caressingly around</l>
     <l n="523">The stone engraved with Sella 's honored name .</l>

    <head>THE FIFTH BOOK OF HOMER 'S ODYSSEY .</head>
    <head>TRANSLATED .</head>
     <l n="1">Aurora , rising from her couch beside</l>
     <l n="2">The famed Tithonus , brought the light of day</l>
     <l n="3">To men and to immortals . Then the gods</l>
     <l n="4">Came to their seats in council . With them came</l>
     <l n="5">High-thundering Jupiter , among them all</l>
     <l n="6">The mightiest . Pallas , mindful of the past ,</l>
     <l n="7">Spoke of Ulysses and his many woes ,</l>
     <l n="8">Grieved that he still was with the island-nymph .</l>
     <l n="9">“ Oh , father Jove , and all ye blessed ones</l>
     <l n="10">Who live forever ! let not sceptred king ,</l>
     <l n="11">Henceforth , be gracious , mild , and merciful ,</l>
     <l n="12">And righteous ; rather be he deaf to prayer ,</l>
     <l n="13">And prone to deeds of wrong , since no one now</l>
     <l n="14">Remembers the divine Ulysses more</l>
     <l n="15">Among the people over whom he ruled ,</l>
     <l n="16">Benignly , like a father . Still he lies ,</l>
     <l n="17">Weighed down by many sorrows , in the isle</l>
     <l n="18">And dwelling of Calypso , who so long</l>
     <l n="19">Constrains his stay . To his dear native land</l>
     <l n="20">Depart he cannot ; ship , arrayed with oars ,</l>
     <l n="21">And seamen has he none , to bear him o'er</l>
     <l n="22">The breast of the broad ocean . Nay , even now ,</l>
     <l n="23">Against his well-beloved son a plot</l>
     <l n="24">Is laid , to slay him as he journeys home</l>
     <l n="25">From Pylos the divine , and from the walls</l>
     <l n="26">Of famous Sparta , whither he had gone</l>
     <l n="27">To gather tidings of his father 's fate . ”</l>
     <l n="28">Then answered her the ruler of the storms :</l>
     <l n="29">“ My child , what words are these that pass thy lips ?</l>
     <l n="30">Was not thy long-determined counsel this ,</l>
     <l n="31">That , in good time , Ulysses should return ,</l>
     <l n="32">To be avenged ? Guide , then , Telemachus ,</l>
     <l n="33">Wisely , for thou canst , that , all unharmed ,</l>
     <l n="34">He reach his native land , and , in their barks ,</l>
     <l n="35">Homeward the suitor-train retrace their way . ”</l>
     <l n="36">He spake , and turned to Hermes , his dear son :</l>
     <l n="37">“ Hermes , for thou , in this , my messenger</l>
     <l n="38">Art , as in all things , to the bright-haired nymph</l>
     <l n="39">Make known my steadfast purpose , the return</l>
     <l n="40">Of suffering Ulysses . Neither gods</l>
     <l n="41">Nor men shall guide his voyage . On a raft ,</l>
     <l n="42">Made firm with bands , he shall depart and reach ,</l>
     <l n="43">After long hardships , on the twentieth day ,</l>
     <l n="44">The fertile shore of Scheria , on whose isle</l>
     <l n="45">Dwell the Pheacians , kinsmen of the gods .</l>
     <l n="46">They like a god shall honor him , and thence</l>
     <l n="47">Send him to his loved country in a ship ,</l>
     <l n="48">With ample gifts of brass and gold , and store</l>
     <l n="49">Of raiment — wealth like which he ne'er had brought</l>
     <l n="50">From conquered Ilion , had he reached his home</l>
     <l n="51">Safely , with all his portion of the spoil .</l>
     <l n="52">So is it preordained , that he behold</l>
     <l n="53">His friends again , and stand once more within</l>
     <l n="54">His high-roofed palace , on his native soil . ”</l>
     <l n="55">He spake ; the herald Argicide obeyed ,</l>
     <l n="56">And hastily beneath his feet he bound</l>
     <l n="57">The fair , ambrosial , golden sandals , worn</l>
     <l n="58">To bear him over ocean like the wind ,</l>
     <l n="59">And o'er the boundless land . His wand he took ,</l>
     <l n="60">Wherewith he softly seals the eyes of men ,</l>
     <l n="61">And opens them at will from sleep . With this</l>
     <l n="62">In hand , the mighty Argos-queller flew ,</l>
     <l n="63">And lighting on Pieria , from the sky</l>
     <l n="64">Plunged downward to the deep , and skimmed its face</l>
     <l n="65">Like hovering sea-mew , that on the broad gulfs</l>
     <l n="66">Of the unfruitful ocean seeks her prey ,</l>
     <l n="67">And often dips her pinions in the brine .</l>
     <l n="68">So Hermes flew along the waste of waves .</l>
     <l n="69">But when he reached that island , far away ,</l>
     <l n="70">Forth from the dark-blue ocean-swell he stepped</l>
     <l n="71">Upon the sea-beach , walking till he came</l>
     <l n="72">To the vast cave in which the bright-haired nymph</l>
     <l n="73">Made her abode . He found the nymph within .</l>
     <l n="74">A fire blazed brightly on the hearth , and far</l>
     <l n="75">Was wafted o'er the isle the fragrant smoke</l>
     <l n="76">Of cloven cedar , burning in the flame ,</l>
     <l n="77">And cypress-wood . Meanwhile , in her recess ,</l>
     <l n="78">She sweetly sang , as busily she threw</l>
     <l n="79">The golden shuttle through the web she wove .</l>
     <l n="80">And all about the grotto alders grew ,</l>
     <l n="81">And poplars , and sweet-smelling cypresses ,</l>
     <l n="82">In a green forest , high among whose boughs</l>
     <l n="83">Birds of broad wing , wood-owls and falcons , built</l>
     <l n="84">Their nests , and crows , with voices sounding far ,</l>
     <l n="85">All haunting for their food the ocean-side .</l>
     <l n="86">A vine , with downy leaves and clustering grapes ,</l>
     <l n="87">Crept over all the cavern-rock . Four springs</l>
     <l n="88">Poured forth their glittering waters in a row ,</l>
     <l n="89">And here and there went wandering side by side .</l>
     <l n="90">Around were meadows of soft green , o'ergrown</l>
     <l n="91">With violets and parsley . ‘ Twas a spot</l>
     <l n="92">Where even an Immortal might , awhile ,</l>
     <l n="93">Linger , and gaze with wonder and delight .</l>
     <l n="94">The herald Argos-queller stood , and saw ,</l>
     <l n="95">And marvelled : but as soon as he had viewed</l>
     <l n="96">The wonders of the place , he turned his steps ,</l>
     <l n="97">Entering the broad-roofed cave . Calypso there ,</l>
     <l n="98">The glorious goddess , saw him as he came ,</l>
     <l n="99">And knew him , for the ever-living gods</l>
     <l n="100">Are to each other known , though one may dwell</l>
     <l n="101">Far from the rest . Ulysses , large of heart ,</l>
     <l n="102">Was not within . Apart , upon the shore ,</l>
     <l n="103">He sat and sorrowed , where he oft , in tears</l>
     <l n="104">And sighs and vain repinings , passed the hours ,</l>
     <l n="105">Gazing with wet eyes on the barren deep .</l>
     <l n="106">Now , placing Hermes on a shining seat</l>
     <l n="107">Of state , Calypso , glorious goddess , said :</l>
     <l n="108">“ Thou of the golden wand , revered and loved ,</l>
     <l n="109">What , Hermes , brings thee hither ? Passing few</l>
     <l n="110">Have been thy visits . Make thy pleasure known ,</l>
     <l n="111">My heart enjoins me to obey , if aught</l>
     <l n="112">That thou commandest be within my power .</l>
     <l n="113">But first accept the offerings due a guest . ”</l>
     <l n="114">The goddess , speaking thus , before him placed</l>
     <l n="115">A table where the heaped ambrosia lay ,</l>
     <l n="116">And mingled the red nectar . Ate and drank</l>
     <l n="117">The herald Argos-queller , and , refreshed ,</l>
     <l n="118">Answered the nymph , and made his message known :</l>
     <l n="119">“ Art thou a goddess , and dost ask of me ,</l>
     <l n="120">A god , why came I hither ? Yet , since thou</l>
     <l n="121">Requirest , I will truly tell the cause .</l>
     <l n="122">I came unwillingly at Jove 's command ,</l>
     <l n="123">For who , of choice , would traverse the wide waste</l>
     <l n="124">Of the salt ocean , with no city near ,</l>
     <l n="125">Where men adore the gods with solemn rites</l>
     <l n="126">And chosen hecatombs ? No god has power</l>
     <l n="127">To elude or to resist the purposes</l>
     <l n="128">Of ægis-bearing Jove . With thee abides ,</l>
     <l n="129">He bids me say , the most unhappy man</l>
     <l n="130">Of all who round the city of Priam waged</l>
     <l n="131">The battle through nine years , and , in the tenth ,</l>
     <l n="132">Laying it waste , departed for their homes .</l>
     <l n="133">But in their voyage , they provoked the wrath</l>
     <l n="134">Of Pallas , who called up the furious winds</l>
     <l n="135">And angry waves against them . By his side</l>
     <l n="136">Sank all his gallant comrades in the deep .</l>
     <l n="137">Him did the winds and waves drive hither . Him</l>
     <l n="138">Jove bids thee send away with speed , for here</l>
     <l n="139">He must not perish , far from all he loves .</l>
     <l n="140">So is it preordained that he behold</l>
     <l n="141">His friends again , and stand once more within</l>
     <l n="142">His high-roofed palace , on his native soil . ”</l>
     <l n="143">He spoke ; Calypso , glorious goddess , heard ,</l>
     <l n="144">And shuddered , and with wingèd words replied :</l>
     <l n="145">“ Ye are unjust , ye gods , and , envious far</l>
     <l n="146">Beyond all other beings , cannot bear</l>
     <l n="147">That ever goddess openly should make</l>
     <l n="148">A mortal man her consort . Thus it was</l>
     <l n="149">When once Aurora , rosy-fingered , took</l>
     <l n="150">Orion for her husband ; ye were stung ,</l>
     <l n="151">Amid your blissful lives , with envious hate ,</l>
     <l n="152">Till chaste Diana , of the golden throne ,</l>
     <l n="153">Smote him with silent arrows from her bow ,</l>
     <l n="154">And slew him in Ortygia . Thus , again ,</l>
     <l n="155">When bright-haired Ceres , swayed by her own heart ,</l>
     <l n="156">In fields which bore three yearly harvests , met</l>
     <l n="157">Iasion as a lover , this was known</l>
     <l n="158">Ere long to Jupiter , who flung from high</l>
     <l n="159">A flaming thunderbolt , and laid him dead .</l>
     <l n="160">And now ye envy me , that with me dwells</l>
     <l n="161">A mortal man . I saved him , as he clung ,</l>
     <l n="162">Alone , upon his floating keel , for Jove</l>
     <l n="163">Had cloven , with a bolt of fire from heaven ,</l>
     <l n="164">His galley in the midst of the black sea ,</l>
     <l n="165">And all his gallant comrades perished there .</l>
     <l n="166">Him kindly I received ; I cherished him ,</l>
     <l n="167">And promised him a life that ne'er should know</l>
     <l n="168">Decay or death . But , since no god has power</l>
     <l n="169">To elude or to withstand the purposes</l>
     <l n="170">Of ægis-bearing Jove , let him depart ,</l>
     <l n="171">If so the sovereign moves him and commands ,</l>
     <l n="172">Over the barren deep . I send him not ;</l>
     <l n="173">For neither ship arrayed with oars have I ,</l>
     <l n="174">Nor seamen , o'er the boundless waste of waves</l>
     <l n="175">To bear him hence . My counsel I will give ,</l>
     <l n="176">And nothing will I hide that he should know ,</l>
     <l n="177">To place him safely on his native shore . ”</l>
     <l n="178">The herald Argos-queller answered her :</l>
     <l n="179">“ Dismiss him thus , and bear in mind the wrath</l>
     <l n="180">Of Jove , lest it be kindled against thee . ”</l>
     <l n="181">Thus having said , the mighty Argicide</l>
     <l n="182">Departed , and the nymph , who now had heard</l>
     <l n="183">The doom of Jove , sought the great-hearted man ,</l>
     <l n="184">Ulysses . Him she found beside the deep ,</l>
     <l n="185">Seated alone , with eyes from which the tears</l>
     <l n="186">Were never dried , for now no more the nymph</l>
     <l n="187">Delighted him ; he wasted his sweet life</l>
     <l n="188">In yearning for his home . Night after night</l>
     <l n="189">He slept constrained within the hollow cave ,</l>
     <l n="190">The unwilling by the fond , and , day by day ,</l>
     <l n="191">He sat upon the rocks that edged the shore ,</l>
     <l n="192">And in continual weeping and in sighs</l>
     <l n="193">And vain repinings , wore the hours away ,</l>
     <l n="194">Gazing through tears upon the barren deep .</l>
     <l n="195">The glorious goddess stood by him and spoke :</l>
     <l n="196">“ Unhappy ! sit no longer sorrowing here ,</l>
     <l n="197">Nor waste life thus . Lo ! I most willingly</l>
     <l n="198">Dismiss thee hence . Rise , hew down trees , and bind</l>
     <l n="199">Their trunks , with brazen clamps , into a raft ,</l>
     <l n="200">And fasten planks above , a lofty floor ,</l>
     <l n="201">That it may bear thee o'er the dark-blue deep .</l>
     <l n="202">Bread will I put on board , water , and wine ,</l>
     <l n="203">Red wine , that cheers the heart , and wrap thee well</l>
     <l n="204">In garments , and send after thee the wind ,</l>
     <l n="205">That safely thou attain thy native shore ;</l>
     <l n="206">If so the gods permit thee , who abide</l>
     <l n="207">In the broad heaven above , and better know</l>
     <l n="208">By far than I , and far more wisely judge . ”</l>
     <l n="209">Ulysses , the great sufferer , as she spoke ,</l>
     <l n="210">Shuddered , and thus with wingèd words replied :</l>
     <l n="211">“ Some other purpose than to send me home</l>
     <l n="212">Is in thy heart , oh goddess , bidding me</l>
     <l n="213">To cross this frightful sea upon a raft ,</l>
     <l n="214">This perilous sea , where never even ships</l>
     <l n="215">Pass with their rapid keels , though Jove bestow</l>
     <l n="216">The wind that glads the seamen . Nay , I climb</l>
     <l n="217">No raft , against thy wish , unless thou swear</l>
     <l n="218">The great oath of the gods , that thou , in this ,</l>
     <l n="219">Dost meditate no other harm to me . ”</l>
     <l n="220">He spake ; Calypso , glorious goddess , smiled ,</l>
     <l n="221">And smoothed his forehead with her hand , and said :</l>
     <l n="222">“ Perverse ! and slow to see where guile is not !</l>
     <l n="223">How could thy heart permit thee thus to speak ?</l>
     <l n="224">Now bear me witness , Earth , and ye broad Heavens</l>
     <l n="225">Above us , and ye waters of the Styx</l>
     <l n="226">That flow beneath us , mightiest oath of all ,</l>
     <l n="227">And most revered by all the blessed gods ,</l>
     <l n="228">That I design no other harm to thee ;</l>
     <l n="229">But that I plan for thee and counsel thee</l>
     <l n="230">What I would do were I in need like thine .</l>
     <l n="231">I bear a juster mind ; my bosom holds</l>
     <l n="232">A pitying heart , and not a heart of steel . ”</l>
     <l n="233">Thus having said , the glorious goddess moved</l>
     <l n="234">Away with hasty steps , and where she trod</l>
     <l n="235">He followed , till they reached the vaulted cave ,</l>
     <l n="236">The goddess and the hero . There he took</l>
     <l n="237">The seat whence Hermes had just risen . The nymph</l>
     <l n="238">Brought forth whatever mortals eat and drink</l>
     <l n="239">To set before him . She , right opposite</l>
     <l n="240">To that of Ulysses , took her seat ,</l>
     <l n="241">Ambrosia there her maidens laid , and there</l>
     <l n="242">Poured nectar . Both put forth their hands , and took</l>
     <l n="243">The ready viands , till at length the calls</l>
     <l n="244">Of hunger and of thirst were satisfied ;</l>
     <l n="245">Calypso , glorious goddess , then began :</l>
     <l n="246">“ Son of Laertes , man of many wiles ,</l>
     <l n="247">High-born Ulysses ! Thus wilt thou depart</l>
     <l n="248">Home to thy native country ? Then farewell ;</l>
     <l n="249">But , couldst thou know the sufferings Fate ordains</l>
     <l n="250">For thee ere yet thou landest on its shore ,</l>
     <l n="251">Thou wouldst remain to keep this home with me ,</l>
     <l n="252">And be immortal , strong as is thy wish</l>
     <l n="253">To see thy wife — a wish that , day by day ,</l>
     <l n="254">Possesses thee . I cannot deem myself</l>
     <l n="255">In form or face less beautiful than she ;</l>
     <l n="256">For never with immortals can the race</l>
     <l n="257">Of mortal dames in form or face compare . ”</l>
     <l n="258">Ulysses , the sagacious , answered her :</l>
     <l n="259">“ Bear with me , gracious goddess ; well I know</l>
     <l n="260">All thou couldst say . The sage Penelope</l>
     <l n="261">In feature and in stature comes not nigh</l>
     <l n="262">To thee ; for she is mortal , deathless thou</l>
     <l n="263">And ever young ; yet , day by day , I long</l>
     <l n="264">To be at home once more , and pine to see</l>
     <l n="265">The hour of my return . Even though some god</l>
     <l n="266">Smite me on the black ocean , I shall bear</l>
     <l n="267">The stroke , for in my bosom dwells a mind</l>
     <l n="268">Patient of suffering ; much have I endured ,</l>
     <l n="269">And much survived , in tempests on the deep ,</l>
     <l n="270">And in the battle ; let this happen too . ”</l>
     <l n="271">He spoke ; the sun went down ; the night came on ,</l>
     <l n="272">And now the twain withdrew to a recess</l>
     <l n="273">Deep in the vaulted cave , where , side by side ,</l>
     <l n="274">They took their rest . But when the child of dawn ,</l>
     <l n="275">Aurora , rosy-fingered , looked abroad ,</l>
     <l n="276">Ulysses put his vest and mantle on ;</l>
     <l n="277">The nymph too , in a robe of silver white ,</l>
     <l n="278">Ample , and delicate , and beautiful ,</l>
     <l n="279">Arrayed herself , and round about her loins</l>
     <l n="280">Wound a fair golden girdle , drew a veil</l>
     <l n="281">Over her head , and planned to send away</l>
     <l n="282">Magnanimous Ulysses . She bestowed</l>
     <l n="283">A heavy axe , of steel , and double-edged ,</l>
     <l n="284">Well fitted to the hand , the handle wrought</l>
     <l n="285">Of olive-wood , firm set and beautiful .</l>
     <l n="286">A polished adze she gave him next , and led</l>
     <l n="287">The way to a far corner of the isle ,</l>
     <l n="288">Where lofty trees , alders and poplars , stood ,</l>
     <l n="289">And firs that reach the clouds , sapless and dry</l>
     <l n="290">Long since , and fitter thus to ride the waves .</l>
     <l n="291">Then , having shown where grew the tallest trees ,</l>
     <l n="292">Calypso , glorious goddess , sought her home .</l>
     <l n="293">Trees then he felled , and soon the task was done .</l>
     <l n="294">Twenty in all he brought to earth , and squared</l>
     <l n="295">Their trunks with the sharp steel , and carefully</l>
     <l n="296">He smoothed their sides , and wrought them by a line .</l>
     <l n="297">Calypso , gracious goddess , having brought</l>
     <l n="298">Wimbles , he bored the beams , and , fitting them</l>
     <l n="299">Together , made them fast with nails and clamps .</l>
     <l n="300">As when some builder , skillful in his art ,</l>
     <l n="301">Frames , for a ship of burden , the broad keel ,</l>
     <l n="302">Such ample breadth Ulysses gave the raft .</l>
     <l n="303">Upon the massy beams he reared a deck ,</l>
     <l n="304">And floored it with long planks from end to end .</l>
     <l n="305">On this a mast he raised , and to the mast</l>
     <l n="306">Fitted a yard ; he shaped a rudder next ,</l>
     <l n="307">To guide the raft along her course , and round</l>
     <l n="308">With woven work of willow-boughs he fenced</l>
     <l n="309">Her sides against the dashings of the sea .</l>
     <l n="310">Calypso , gracious goddess , brought him store</l>
     <l n="311">Of canvas , which he fitly shaped to sails ,</l>
     <l n="312">And , rigging her with cords , and ropes , and stays ,</l>
     <l n="313">Heaved her with levers into the great deep .</l>
     <l n="314">‘ Twas the fourth day ; his labors now were done ,</l>
     <l n="315">And , on the fifth , the goddess from her isle</l>
     <l n="316">Dismissed him , newly from the bath , arrayed</l>
     <l n="317">In garments given by her , that shed perfumes .</l>
     <l n="318">A skin of dark-red wine she put on board ,</l>
     <l n="319">A larger one of water , and for food</l>
     <l n="320">A basket , stored with viands such as please</l>
     <l n="321">The appetite . A friendly wind and soft</l>
     <l n="322">She sent before . The great Ulysses spread</l>
     <l n="323">His canvas joyfully , to catch the breeze ,</l>
     <l n="324">And sat and guided with nice care the helm ,</l>
     <l n="325">Gazing with fixed eye on the Pleiades ,</l>
     <l n="326">Boötes setting late , and the Great Bear ,</l>
     <l n="327">By others called the Wain , which , wheeling round ,</l>
     <l n="328">Looks ever toward Orion , and alone</l>
     <l n="329">Dips not into the waters of the deep .</l>
     <l n="330">For so Calypso , glorious goddess , bade</l>
     <l n="331">That , on his ocean journey , he should keep</l>
     <l n="332">That constellation ever on his left .</l>
     <l n="333">Now seventeen days were in the voyage past ,</l>
     <l n="334">And on the eighteenth shadowy heights appeared ,</l>
     <l n="335">The nearest point of the Pheacian land ,</l>
     <l n="336">Lying on the dark ocean like a shield .</l>
     <l n="337">But mighty Neptune , coming from among</l>
     <l n="338">The Ethiopians , saw him . Far away</l>
     <l n="339">He saw , from mountain-heights of Solyma ,</l>
     <l n="340">The voyager , and burned with fiercer wrath ,</l>
     <l n="341">And shook his head , and said within himself :</l>
     <l n="342">“ Strange ! now I see the gods have new designs</l>
     <l n="343">For this Ulysses , formed while I was yet</l>
     <l n="344">In Ethiopia . He draws near the land</l>
     <l n="345">Of the Pheacians , where it is decreed</l>
     <l n="346">He shall o'erpass the boundary of his woes ;</l>
     <l n="347">But first , I think , he will have much to bear . ”</l>
     <l n="348">He spoke , and round about him called the clouds</l>
     <l n="349">And roused the ocean , wielding in his hand</l>
     <l n="350">The trident , summoned all the hurricanes</l>
     <l n="351">Of all the winds , and covered earth and sky</l>
     <l n="352">At once with mists , while from above , the night</l>
     <l n="353">Fell suddenly . The east wind and the south</l>
     <l n="354">Rushed forth at once , with the strong-blowing west ,</l>
     <l n="355">And the clear north rolled up his mighty waves .</l>
     <l n="356">Ulysses trembled in his knees and heart ,</l>
     <l n="357">And thus to his great soul , lamenting , said :</l>
     <l n="358">“ What will become of me ? unhappy man !</l>
     <l n="359">I fear that all the goddess said was true ,</l>
     <l n="360">Foretelling what disasters should o'ertake</l>
     <l n="361">My voyage , ere I reach my native land .</l>
     <l n="362">Now are her words fulfilled . Now Jupiter</l>
     <l n="363">Wraps the great heaven in clouds and stirs the deep</l>
     <l n="364">To tumult ! Wilder grow the hurricanes</l>
     <l n="365">Of all the winds , and now my fate is sure .</l>
     <l n="366">Thrice happy , four times happy they , who fell</l>
     <l n="367">On Troy 's wide field , warring for Atreus ’ sons :</l>
     <l n="368">O , had I met my fate and perished there ,</l>
     <l n="369">That very day on which the Trojan host ,</l>
     <l n="370">Around the dead Achilles , hurled at me</l>
     <l n="371">Their brazen javelins ! I had then received</l>
     <l n="372">Due burial and great glory with the Greeks ;</l>
     <l n="373">Now must I die a miserable death . ”</l>
     <l n="374">As thus he spoke , upon him , from on high ,</l>
     <l n="375">A huge and frightful billow broke ; it whirled</l>
     <l n="376">The raft around , and far from it he fell .</l>
     <l n="377">His hands let go the rudder ; a fierce rush</l>
     <l n="378">Of all the winds together snapped in twain</l>
     <l n="379">The mast ; far off the yard and canvas flew</l>
     <l n="380">Into the deep ; the billow held him long</l>
     <l n="381">Beneath the waters , and he strove in vain</l>
     <l n="382">Quickly to rise to air from that huge swell</l>
     <l n="383">Of ocean , for the garments weighed him down</l>
     <l n="384">Which fair Calypso gave him . But , at length ,</l>
     <l n="385">Emerging , he rejected from his throat</l>
     <l n="386">The bitter brine that down his forehead streamed .</l>
     <l n="387">Even then , though hopeless with dismay , his thought</l>
     <l n="388">Was on the raft , and , struggling through the waves ,</l>
     <l n="389">He seized it , sprang on board , and seated there</l>
     <l n="390">Escaped the threatened death . Still to and fro</l>
     <l n="391">The rolling billows drove it . As the wind</l>
     <l n="392">In autumn sweeps the thistles o'er the field ,</l>
     <l n="393">Clinging together , so the blasts of heaven</l>
     <l n="394">Hither and thither drove it o'er the sea .</l>
     <l n="395">And now the south wind flung it to the north</l>
     <l n="396">To buffet ; now the east wind to the west .</l>
     <l n="397">Ino Leucothea saw him clinging there ,</l>
     <l n="398">The delicate-footed child of Cadmus , once</l>
     <l n="399">A mortal , speaking with a mortal voice ;</l>
     <l n="400">Though now within the ocean-gulfs , she shares</l>
     <l n="401">The honors of the gods . With pity she</l>
     <l n="402">Beheld Ulysses struggling thus distressed ,</l>
     <l n="403">And , rising from the abyss below , in form</l>
     <l n="404">A cormorant , the sea-nymph took her perch</l>
     <l n="405">On the well-banded raft , and thus she said :</l>
     <l n="406">“ Ah , luckless man , how hast thou angered thus</l>
     <l n="407">Earth-shaking Neptune , that he visits thee</l>
     <l n="408">With these disasters ? Yet he cannot take ,</l>
     <l n="409">Although he seek it earnestly , thy life .</l>
     <l n="410">Now do my bidding , for thou seemest wise .</l>
     <l n="411">Laying aside thy garments , let the raft</l>
     <l n="412">Drift with the winds , while thou , by strength of arm ,</l>
     <l n="413">Makest thy way in swimming to the land</l>
     <l n="414">Of the Pheacians , where thy safety lies .</l>
     <l n="415">Receive this veil and bind its heavenly woof</l>
     <l n="416">Beneath thy breast , and have no further fear</l>
     <l n="417">Of hardship or of danger . But , as soon</l>
     <l n="418">As thou shalt touch the island , take it off ,</l>
     <l n="419">And turn away thy face , and fling it far</l>
     <l n="420">From where thou standest , into the black deep . ”</l>
     <l n="421">The goddess gave the veil as thus she spoke ,</l>
     <l n="422">And to the tossing deep went down , in form</l>
     <l n="423">A cormorant ; the black wave covered her .</l>
     <l n="424">But still Ulysses , mighty sufferer ,</l>
     <l n="425">Pondered , and thus to his great soul he said :</l>
     <l n="426">“ Ah me ! perhaps some god is planning here</l>
     <l n="427">Some other fraud against me , bidding me</l>
     <l n="428">Forsake my raft . I will not yet obey ,</l>
     <l n="429">For still far off I see the land in which</l>
     <l n="430">‘ Tis said my refuge lies . This will I do ,</l>
     <l n="431">For this seems wisest . While the fastenings last</l>
     <l n="432">That hold these timbers , I will keep my place</l>
     <l n="433">And bide the tempest here . But when the waves</l>
     <l n="434">Shall dash my raft in pieces , I will swim ,</l>
     <l n="435">For nothing better will remain to do . ”</l>
     <l n="436">As he revolved this purpose in his mind ,</l>
     <l n="437">Earth-shaking Neptune sent a mighty wave ,</l>
     <l n="438">Horrid , and huge , and high , and where he sat</l>
     <l n="439">It smote him . As a violent wind uplifts</l>
     <l n="440">The dry chaff heaped upon a threshing-floor ,</l>
     <l n="441">And sends it scattered through the air abroad ,</l>
     <l n="442">So did that wave fling loose the ponderous beams .</l>
     <l n="443">To one of these , Ulysses , clinging fast ,</l>
     <l n="444">Bestrode it , like a horseman on his steed ;</l>
     <l n="445">And now he took the garments off , bestowed</l>
     <l n="446">By fair Calypso , binding round his breast</l>
     <l n="447">The veil , and forward plunged into the deep ,</l>
     <l n="448">With palms outspread , prepared to swim . Meanwhile ,</l>
     <l n="449">Neptune beheld him , Neptune , mighty king ,</l>
     <l n="450">And shook his head , and said within himself :</l>
     <l n="451">“ Go thus , and , laden with mischances , roam</l>
     <l n="452">The waters , till thou come among the race</l>
     <l n="453">Cherished by Jupiter ; but well I deem</l>
     <l n="454">Thou wilt not find thy share of suffering light . ”</l>
     <l n="455">Thus having spoke , he urged his coursers on ,</l>
     <l n="456">With their fair-flowing manes , until he came</l>
     <l n="457">To Ægæ , where his glorious palace stands .</l>
     <l n="458">But Pallas , child of Jove , had other thoughts .</l>
     <l n="459">She stayed the course of every wind beside ,</l>
     <l n="460">And bade them rest , and lulled them into sleep ,</l>
     <l n="461">But summoned the swift north to break the waves ,</l>
     <l n="462">That so Ulysses , the high-born , escaped</l>
     <l n="463">From death and from the fates , might be the guest</l>
     <l n="464">Of the Pheacians , men who love the sea .</l>
     <l n="465">Two days and nights , among the mighty waves</l>
     <l n="466">He floated , oft his heart foreboding death ,</l>
     <l n="467">But when the bright-haired Eos had fulfilled</l>
     <l n="468">The third day 's course , and all the winds were laid ,</l>
     <l n="469">And calm was on the watery waste , he saw</l>
     <l n="470">The land was near , as , lifted on the crest</l>
     <l n="471">Of a huge swell , he looked with sharpened sight ;</l>
     <l n="472">And as a father 's life preserved makes glad</l>
     <l n="473">His children 's hearts , when long time he has lain</l>
     <l n="474">Sick , wrung with pain , and wasting by the power</l>
     <l n="475">Of some malignant genius , till , at length ,</l>
     <l n="476">The gracious gods bestow a welcome cure ;</l>
     <l n="477">So welcome to Ulysses was the sight</l>
     <l n="478">Of woods and fields . By swimming on he thought</l>
     <l n="479">To climb and tread the shore , but when he drew</l>
     <l n="480">So near that one who shouted could be heard</l>
     <l n="481">From land , the sound of ocean on the rocks</l>
     <l n="482">Came to his ear , for there huge breakers roared</l>
     <l n="483">And spouted fearfully , and all around</l>
     <l n="484">Was covered with the sea-foam . Haven here</l>
     <l n="485">Was none for ships , nor sheltering creek , but shores</l>
     <l n="486">Beetling from high , and crags and walls of rock .</l>
     <l n="487">Ulysses trembled both in knees and heart ,</l>
     <l n="488">And thus , to his great soul , lamenting , said :</l>
     <l n="489">“ Now woe is me ! as soon as Jove has shown</l>
     <l n="490">What I had little hoped to see , the land ,</l>
     <l n="491">And I through all these waves have ploughed my way ,</l>
     <l n="492">I find no issue from the hoary deep .</l>
     <l n="493">For sharp rocks border it , and all around</l>
     <l n="494">Roar the wild surges ; slippery cliffs arise</l>
     <l n="495">Close to deep gulfs , and footing there is none ,</l>
     <l n="496">Where I might plant my steps and thus escape .</l>
     <l n="497">All effort now were fruitless to resist</l>
     <l n="498">The mighty billow hurrying me away</l>
     <l n="499">To dash me on the pointed rocks . If yet</l>
     <l n="500">I strive , by swimming further , to descry</l>
     <l n="501">Some sloping shore or harbor of the isle ,</l>
     <l n="502">I fear the tempest , lest it hurl me back ,</l>
     <l n="503">Heavily groaning , to the fishy deep ,</l>
     <l n="504">Or huge sea-monster , from the multitude</l>
     <l n="505">Which sovereign Amphitrite feeds , be sent</l>
     <l n="506">Against me by some god , for well I know</l>
     <l n="507">The power who shakes the shores is wroth with me . ”</l>
     <l n="508">While he revolved these doubts within his mind ,</l>
     <l n="509">A huge wave hurled him toward the rugged coast .</l>
     <l n="510">Then had his limbs been flayed , and all his bones</l>
     <l n="511">Broken at once , had not the blue-eyed maid ,</l>
     <l n="512">Minerva , prompted him . Borne toward the rock ,</l>
     <l n="513">He clutched it instantly , with both his hands ,</l>
     <l n="514">And panting clung till that huge wave rolled by ,</l>
     <l n="515">And so escaped its fury . But it came ,</l>
     <l n="516">And smote him once again , and flung him far</l>
     <l n="517">Seaward . As to the claws of polypus ,</l>
     <l n="518">Plucked from its bed , the pebbles thickly cling ,</l>
     <l n="519">So flakes of skin , from off his powerful hands ,</l>
     <l n="520">Were left upon the rock . The mighty surge</l>
     <l n="521">O'erwhelmed him ; he had perished ere his time ,</l>
     <l n="522">Hapless Ulysses , but the blue-eyed maid ,</l>
     <l n="523">Pallas , informed his mind with forecast . Straight</l>
     <l n="524">Emerging from the wave that shoreward rolled ,</l>
     <l n="525">He swam along the coast and eyed it well ,</l>
     <l n="526">In hope of sloping beach or sheltered creek .</l>
     <l n="527">But when , in swimming , he had reached the mouth</l>
     <l n="528">Of a soft-flowing river , here appeared</l>
     <l n="529">The spot he wished for , smooth , without a rock ,</l>
     <l n="530">And here was shelter from the wind . He felt</l>
     <l n="531">The current 's flow , and thus devoutly prayed :</l>
     <l n="532">“ Hear me , oh sovereign power , whoe'er thou art !</l>
     <l n="533">To thee , the long-desired , I come . I seek</l>
     <l n="534">Escape from Neptune 's threatenings on the sea .</l>
     <l n="535">The deathless gods respect the prayer of him</l>
     <l n="536">Who looks to them for help , a fugitive ,</l>
     <l n="537">As I am now , when to thy stream I come ,</l>
     <l n="538">And to thy knees , from many a hardship past ,</l>
     <l n="539">Oh thou that here art ruler , I declare</l>
     <l n="540">Myself thy suppliant ; be thou merciful . ”</l>
     <l n="541">He spoke ; the river stayed his current , checked</l>
     <l n="542">The billows , smoothed them , to a calm , and gave</l>
     <l n="543">The swimmer a safe landing at his mouth .</l>
     <l n="544">Then dropped his knees and sinewy arms , at once</l>
     <l n="545">Unstrung , for faint with struggling was his heart .</l>
     <l n="546">His body was all swoln ; the brine gushed forth</l>
     <l n="547">From mouth and nostrils ; all unnerved he lay ,</l>
     <l n="548">Breathless and speechless ; utter weariness</l>
     <l n="549">O'ermastered him . But when he breathed again ,</l>
     <l n="550">And his flown senses had returned , he loosed</l>
     <l n="551">The veil that Ino gave him from his breast ,</l>
     <l n="552">And to the salt flood cast it . A great wave</l>
     <l n="553">Bore it far down the stream ; the goddess there</l>
     <l n="554">In her own hands received it . He , meanwhile ,</l>
     <l n="555">Withdrawing from the brink , lay down among</l>
     <l n="556">The reeds , and kissed the harvest-bearing earth ,</l>
     <l n="557">And thus to his great soul , lamenting , said :</l>
     <l n="558">“ Ah me ! what must I suffer more ! what yet</l>
     <l n="559">Will happen to me ? If , by the river 's side ,</l>
     <l n="560">I pass the unfriendly watches of the night ,</l>
     <l n="561">The cruel cold and dews that steep the bank</l>
     <l n="562">May , in this weakness , end me utterly ,</l>
     <l n="563">For chilly blows the river-air at dawn .</l>
     <l n="564">But should I climb this hill , to sleep within</l>
     <l n="565">The shadowy wood , among their shrubs , if cold</l>
     <l n="566">And weariness allow me , then I fear ,</l>
     <l n="567">That , while the pleasant slumbers o'er me steal ,</l>
     <l n="568">I may become the prey of savage beasts . ”</l>
     <l n="569">Yet , as he longer pondered , this seemed best .</l>
     <l n="570">He rose and sought the wood , and found it near</l>
     <l n="571">The water , on a height , o'erlooking far</l>
     <l n="572">The region round . Between two shrubs , that sprung</l>
     <l n="573">Both from one spot , he entered — olive-trees ,</l>
     <l n="574">One wild , one fruitful . The damp-blowing wind</l>
     <l n="575">Ne'er pierced their covert ; never blazing sun</l>
     <l n="576">Darted his beams within , nor pelting shower</l>
     <l n="577">Beat through , so closely intertwined they grew .</l>
     <l n="578">Here entering , Ulysses heaped a bed</l>
     <l n="579">Of leaves with his own hands ; he made it broad</l>
     <l n="580">And high , for thick the leaves had fallen around .</l>
     <l n="581">Two men and three , in that abundant store ,</l>
     <l n="582">Might bide the winter-storm , though keen the cold .</l>
     <l n="583">Ulysses , the great sufferer , on his couch</l>
     <l n="584">Looked and rejoiced , and placed himself within ,</l>
     <l n="585">And heaped the leaves high o'er him and around .</l>
     <l n="586">As one who , dwelling in the distant fields ,</l>
     <l n="587">Without a neighbor near him , hides a brand</l>
     <l n="588">In the dark ashes , keeping carefully</l>
     <l n="589">The seeds of fire alive , lest he , perforce ,</l>
     <l n="590">To light his hearth must bring them from afar ;</l>
     <l n="591">So did Ulysses , in that pile of leaves ,</l>
     <l n="592">Bury himself , while Pallas o'er his eyes</l>
     <l n="593">Poured sleep and closed his lids , that he might take ,</l>
     <l n="594">After his painful toils , the fitting rest .</l>

    <head>THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW .</head>
     <l n="1">Alice .— One of your old-world stories , Uncle John ,</l>
     <l n="2">Such as you tell us by the winter fire ,</l>
     <l n="3">Till we all wonder it is grown so late .</l>
     <l n="4">Uncle John .— The story of the witch that ground to death</l>
     <l n="5">Two children in her mill , or will you have</l>
     <l n="6">The tale of Goody Cutpurse ?</l>
     <l n="7">Alice .— Nay now , nay ;</l>
     <l n="8">Those stories are too childish , Uncle John ,</l>
     <l n="9">Too childish even for little Willy here ,</l>
     <l n="10">And I am older , two good years , than he ;</l>
     <l n="11">No , let us have a tale of elves that ride ,</l>
     <l n="12">By night , with jingling reins , or gnomes of the mine ,</l>
     <l n="13">Or water-fairies , such as you know how</l>
     <l n="14">To spin , till Willy 's eyes forget to wink ,</l>
     <l n="15">And good Aunt Mary , busy as she is ,</l>
     <l n="16">Lays down her knitting .</l>
     <l n="17">Uncle John .— Listen to me , then .</l>
     <l n="18">‘ Twas in the olden time , long , long ago ,</l>
     <l n="19">And long before the great oak at our door</l>
     <l n="20">Was yet an acorn , on a mountain 's side</l>
     <l n="21">Lived , with his wife , a cottager . They dwelt</l>
     <l n="22">Beside a glen and near a clashing brook ,</l>
     <l n="23">A pleasant spot in spring , where first the wren</l>
     <l n="24">Was heard to chatter , and , among the grass ,</l>
     <l n="25">Flowers opened earliest ; but when winter came ,</l>
     <l n="26">That little brook was fringed with other flowers ,—</l>
     <l n="27">White flowers , with crystal leaf and stem , that grew</l>
     <l n="28">In clear November nights . And , later still ,</l>
     <l n="29">That mountain-glen was filled with drifted snows</l>
     <l n="30">From side to side , that one might walk across ;</l>
     <l n="31">While , many a fathom deep , below , the brook</l>
     <l n="32">Sang to itself , and leaped and trotted on</l>
     <l n="33">Unfrozen , o'er its pebbles , toward the vale .</l>
     <l n="34">Alice .— A mountain-side , you said ; the Alps , perhaps ,</l>
     <l n="35">Or our own Alleghanies .</l>
     <l n="36">Uncle John .— Not so fast ,</l>
     <l n="37">My young geographer , for then the Alps ,</l>
     <l n="38">With their broad pastures , haply were untrod</l>
     <l n="39">Of herdsman 's foot , and never human voice</l>
     <l n="40">Had sounded in the woods that overhang</l>
     <l n="41">Our Alleghany 's streams . I think it was</l>
     <l n="42">Upon the slopes of the great Caucasus ,</l>
     <l n="43">Or where the rivulets of Ararat</l>
     <l n="44">Seek the Armenian vales . That mountain rose</l>
     <l n="45">So high , that , on its top , the winter-snow</l>
     <l n="46">Was never melted , and the cottagers</l>
     <l n="47">Among the summer-blossoms , far below ,</l>
     <l n="48">Saw its white peaks in August from their door .</l>
     <l n="49">One little maiden , in that cottage-home ,</l>
     <l n="50">Dwelt with her parents , light of heart and limb ,</l>
     <l n="51">Bright , restless , thoughtless , flitting here and there ,</l>
     <l n="52">Like sunshine on the uneasy ocean-waves ,</l>
     <l n="53">And sometimes she forgot what she was bid ,</l>
     <l n="54">As Alice does .</l>
     <l n="55">Alice .— Or Willy , quite as oft .</l>
     <l n="56">Uncle John .— But you are older , Alice , two good years ,</l>
     <l n="57">And should be wiser . Eva was the name</l>
     <l n="58">Of this young maiden , now twelve summers old .</l>
     <l n="59">Now you must know that , in those early times ,</l>
     <l n="60">When autumn days grew pale , there came a troop</l>
     <l n="61">Of childlike forms from that cold mountain-top ;</l>
     <l n="62">With trailing garments through the air they came ,</l>
     <l n="63">Or walked the ground with girded loins , and threw</l>
     <l n="64">Spangles of silvery frost upon the grass ,</l>
     <l n="65">And edged the brooks with glistening parapets ,</l>
     <l n="66">And built it crystal bridges , touched the pool ,</l>
     <l n="67">And turned its face to glass , or , rising thence ,</l>
     <l n="68">They shook from their full laps the soft , light snow ,</l>
     <l n="69">And buried the great earth , as autumn winds</l>
     <l n="70">Bury the forest-floor in heaps of leaves .</l>
     <l n="71">A beautiful race were they , with baby brows ,</l>
     <l n="72">And fair , bright locks , and voices like the sound</l>
     <l n="73">Of steps on the crisp snow , in which they talked</l>
     <l n="74">With man , as friend with friend . A merry sight</l>
     <l n="75">It was , when , crowding round the traveller ,</l>
     <l n="76">They smote him with their heaviest snow-flakes , flung</l>
     <l n="77">Needles of frost in handfuls at his cheeks ,</l>
     <l n="78">And , of the light wreaths of his smoking breath ,</l>
     <l n="79">Wove a white fringe for his brown beard , and laughed</l>
     <l n="80">Their slender laugh to see him wink and grin</l>
     <l n="81">And make grim faces as he floundered on .</l>
     <l n="82">But , when the spring came on , what terror reigned</l>
     <l n="83">Among these Little People of the Snow !</l>
     <l n="84">To them the sun 's warm beams were shafts of fire ,</l>
     <l n="85">And the soft south-wind was the wind of death .</l>
     <l n="86">Away they flew , all with a pretty scowl</l>
     <l n="87">Upon their childish faces , to the north ,</l>
     <l n="88">Or scampered upward to the mountain 's top ,</l>
     <l n="89">And there defied their enemy , the Spring ;</l>
     <l n="90">Skipping and dancing on the frozen peaks ,</l>
     <l n="91">And moulding little snow-balls in their palms ,</l>
     <l n="92">And rolling them , to crush her flowers below ,</l>
     <l n="93">Down the steep snow-fields .</l>
     <l n="94">Alice .— That , too , must have been</l>
     <l n="95">A merry sight to look at .</l>
     <l n="96">Uncle John .— You are right ,</l>
     <l n="97">But I must speak of graver matters now .</l>
     <l n="98">Midwinter was the time , and Eva stood ,</l>
     <l n="99">Within the cottage , all prepared to dare</l>
     <l n="100">The outer cold , with ample furry robe</l>
     <l n="101">Close-belted round her waist , and boots of fur ,</l>
     <l n="102">And a broad kerchief , which her mother 's hand</l>
     <l n="103">Had closely drawn about her ruddy cheek .</l>
     <l n="104">“ Now , stay not long abroad , ” said the good dame ,</l>
     <l n="105">“ For sharp is the outer air , and , mark me well ,</l>
     <l n="106">Go not upon the snow beyond the spot</l>
     <l n="107">Where the great linden bounds the neighboring field . ”</l>
     <l n="108">The little maiden promised , and went forth ,</l>
     <l n="109">And climbed the rounded snow-swells firm with frost</l>
     <l n="110">Beneath her feet , and slid , with balancing arms ,</l>
     <l n="111">Into the hollows . Once , as up a drift</l>
     <l n="112">She slowly rose , before her , in the way ,</l>
     <l n="113">She saw a little creature , lily-cheeked ,</l>
     <l n="114">With flowing flaxen locks , and faint blue eyes ,</l>
     <l n="115">That gleamed like ice , and robe that only seemed</l>
     <l n="116">Of a more shadowy whiteness than her cheek .</l>
     <l n="117">On a smooth bank she sat .</l>
     <l n="118">Alice .— She must have been</l>
     <l n="119">One of your Little People of the Snow .</l>
     <l n="120">Uncle John .— She was so , and , as Eva now drew near ,</l>
     <l n="121">The tiny creature bounded from her seat ;</l>
     <l n="122">“ And come , ” she said , “ my pretty friend ; to-day</l>
     <l n="123">We will be playmates . I have watched thee long ,</l>
     <l n="124">And seen how well thou lov'st to walk these drifts ,</l>
     <l n="125">And scoop their fair sides into little cells ,</l>
     <l n="126">And carve them with quaint figures , huge-limbed men ,</l>
     <l n="127">Lions , and griffins . We will have , to-day ,</l>
     <l n="128">A merry ramble over these bright fields ,</l>
     <l n="129">And thou shalt see what thou hast never seen . ”</l>
     <l n="130">On went the pair , until they reached the bound</l>
     <l n="131">Where the great linden stood , set deep in snow ,</l>
     <l n="132">Up to the lower branches . “ Here we stop , ”</l>
     <l n="133">Said Eva , “ for my mother has my word</l>
     <l n="134">That I will go no farther than this tree . ”</l>
     <l n="135">Then the snow-maiden laughed : “ And what is this ?</l>
     <l n="136">This fear of the pure snow , the innocent snow ,</l>
     <l n="137">That never harmed aught living ? Thou mayst roam</l>
     <l n="138">For leagues beyond this garden , and return</l>
     <l n="139">In safety ; here the grim wolf never prowls ,</l>
     <l n="140">And here the eagle of our mountain-crags</l>
     <l n="141">Preys not in winter . I will show the way ,</l>
     <l n="142">And bring thee safely home . Thy mother , sure ,</l>
     <l n="143">Counselled thee thus because thou hadst no guide . ”</l>
     <l n="144">By such smooth words was Eva won to break</l>
     <l n="145">Her promise , and went on with her new friend ,</l>
     <l n="146">Over the glistening snow and down a bank</l>
     <l n="147">Where a white shelf , wrought by the eddying wind ,</l>
     <l n="148">Like to a billow 's crest in the great sea ,</l>
     <l n="149">Curtained an opening . “ Look , we enter here . ”</l>
     <l n="150">And straight , beneath the fair o'erhanging fold ,</l>
     <l n="151">Entered the little pair that hill of snow ,</l>
     <l n="152">Walking along a passage with white walls ,</l>
     <l n="153">And a white vault above where snow-stars shed</l>
     <l n="154">A wintry twilight . Eva moved in awe ,</l>
     <l n="155">And held her peace , but the snow-maiden smiled ,</l>
     <l n="156">And talked and tripped along , as down the way ,</l>
     <l n="157">Deeper they went into that mountainous drift .</l>
     <l n="158">And now the white walls widened , and the vault</l>
     <l n="159">Swelled upward , like some vast cathedral-dome ,</l>
     <l n="160">Such as the Florentine , who bore the name</l>
     <l n="161">Of heaven 's most potent angel , reared , long since ,</l>
     <l n="162">Or the unknown builder of that wondrous fane ,</l>
     <l n="163">The glory of Burgos . Here a garden lay ,</l>
     <l n="164">In which the Little People of the Snow</l>
     <l n="165">Were wont to take their pastime when their tasks</l>
     <l n="166">Upon the mountain 's side and in the clouds</l>
     <l n="167">Were ended . Here they taught the silent frost</l>
     <l n="168">To mock , in stem and spray , and leaf and flower ,</l>
     <l n="169">The growths of summer . Here the palm upreared</l>
     <l n="170">Its white columnar trunk and spotless sheaf</l>
     <l n="171">Of plume-like leaves ; here cedars , huge as those</l>
     <l n="172">Of Lebanon , stretched far their level boughs ,</l>
     <l n="173">Yet pale and shadowless ; the sturdy oak</l>
     <l n="174">Stood , with its huge gnarled roots of seeming strength ,</l>
     <l n="175">Fast anchored in the glistening bank ; light sprays</l>
     <l n="176">Of myrtle , roses in their bud and bloom ,</l>
     <l n="177">Drooped by the winding walks ; yet all seemed wrought</l>
     <l n="178">Of stainless alabaster ; up the trees</l>
     <l n="179">Ran the lithe jessamine , with stalk and leaf</l>
     <l n="180">Colorless as her flowers . “ Go softly on , ”</l>
     <l n="181">Said the snow-maiden ; “ touch not , with thy hand ,</l>
     <l n="182">The frail creation round thee , and beware</l>
     <l n="183">To sweep it with thy skirts . Now look above .</l>
     <l n="184">How sumptuously these bowers are lighted up</l>
     <l n="185">With shifting gleams that softly come and go !</l>
     <l n="186">These are the northern lights , such as thou seest</l>
     <l n="187">In the midwinter nights , cold , wandering flames ,</l>
     <l n="188">That float with our processions , through the air ;</l>
     <l n="189">And here , within our winter palaces ,</l>
     <l n="190">Mimic the glorious daybreak . ” Then she told</l>
     <l n="191">How , when the wind , in the long winter nights ,</l>
     <l n="192">Swept the light snows into the hollow dell ,</l>
     <l n="193">She and her comrades guided to its place</l>
     <l n="194">Each wandering flake , and piled them quaintly up ,</l>
     <l n="195">In shapely colonnade and glistening arch ,</l>
     <l n="196">With shadowy aisles between , or bade them grow ,</l>
     <l n="197">Beneath their little hands , to bowery walks</l>
     <l n="198">In gardens such as these , and , o'er them all ,</l>
     <l n="199">Built the broad roof . “ But thou hast yet to see</l>
     <l n="200">A fairer sight , ” she said , and led the way</l>
     <l n="201">To where a window of pellucid ice</l>
     <l n="202">Stood in the wall of snow , beside their path .</l>
     <l n="203">“ Look , but thou mayst not enter . ” Eva looked ,</l>
     <l n="204">And lo ! a glorious hall , from whose high vault</l>
     <l n="205">Stripes of soft light , ruddy and delicate green ,</l>
     <l n="206">And tender blue , flowed downward to the floor</l>
     <l n="207">And far around , as if the aërial hosts ,</l>
     <l n="208">That march on high by night , with beamy spears ,</l>
     <l n="209">And streaming banners , to that place had brought</l>
     <l n="210">Their radiant flags to grace a festival .</l>
     <l n="211">And in that hall a joyous multitude</l>
     <l n="212">Of these by whom its glistening walls were reared ,</l>
     <l n="213">Whirled in a merry dance to silvery sounds ,</l>
     <l n="214">That rang from cymbals of transparent ice ,</l>
     <l n="215">And ice-cups , quivering to the skilful touch</l>
     <l n="216">Of little fingers . Round and round they flew ,</l>
     <l n="217">As when , in spring , about a chimney-top ,</l>
     <l n="218">A cloud of twittering swallows , just returned ,</l>
     <l n="219">Wheel round and round , and turn and wheel again ,</l>
     <l n="220">Unwinding their swift track . So rapidly</l>
     <l n="221">Flowed the meandering stream of that fair dance ,</l>
     <l n="222">Beneath that dome of light . Bright eyes that looked</l>
     <l n="223">From under lily-brows , and gauzy scarfs</l>
     <l n="224">Sparkling like snow-wreaths in the early sun ,</l>
     <l n="225">Shot by the window in their mazy whirl .</l>
     <l n="226">And there stood Eva , wondering at the sight</l>
     <l n="227">Of those bright revellers and that graceful sweep</l>
     <l n="228">Of motion as they passed her ;— long she gazed ,</l>
     <l n="229">And listened long to the sweet sounds that thrilled</l>
     <l n="230">The frosty air , till now the encroaching cold</l>
     <l n="231">Recalled her to herself . “ Too long , too long</l>
     <l n="232">I linger here , ” she said , and then she sprang</l>
     <l n="233">Into the path , and with a hurried step</l>
     <l n="234">Followed it upward . Ever by her side</l>
     <l n="235">Her little guide kept pace . As on they went ,</l>
     <l n="236">Eva bemoaned her fault : “ What must they think —</l>
     <l n="237">The dear ones in the cottage , while so long ,</l>
     <l n="238">Hour after hour , I stay without ? I know</l>
     <l n="239">That they will seek me far and near , and weep</l>
     <l n="240">To find me not . How could I , wickedly ,</l>
     <l n="241">Neglect the charge they gave me ? ” As she spoke ,</l>
     <l n="242">The hot tears started to her eyes ; she knelt</l>
     <l n="243">In the mid-path . “ Father ! forgive this sin ;</l>
     <l n="244">Forgive myself I cannot ” — thus she prayed ,</l>
     <l n="245">And rose and hastened onward . When , at last ,</l>
     <l n="246">They reached the outer air , the clear north breathed</l>
     <l n="247">A bitter cold , from which she shrank with dread ,</l>
     <l n="248">But the snow-maiden bounded as she felt</l>
     <l n="249">The cutting blast , and uttered shouts of joy ,</l>
     <l n="250">And skipped , with boundless glee , from drift to drift ,</l>
     <l n="251">And danced round Eva , as she labored up</l>
     <l n="252">The mounds of snow . “ Ah me ! I feel my eyes</l>
     <l n="253">Grow heavy , ” Eva said ; “ they swim with sleep ;</l>
     <l n="254">I cannot walk for utter weariness ,</l>
     <l n="255">And I must rest a moment on this bank ,</l>
     <l n="256">But let it not be long . ” As thus she spoke ,</l>
     <l n="257">In half formed words , she sank on the smooth snow ,</l>
     <l n="258">With closing lids . Her guide composed the robe</l>
     <l n="259">About her limbs , and said : “ A pleasant spot</l>
     <l n="260">Is this to slumber in ; on such a couch</l>
     <l n="261">Oft have I slept away the winter night ,</l>
     <l n="262">And had the sweetest dreams . ” So Eva slept ,</l>
     <l n="263">But slept in death ; for when the power of frost</l>
     <l n="264">Locks up the motions of the living frame ,</l>
     <l n="265">The victim passes to the realm of Death</l>
     <l n="266">Through the dim porch of Sleep . The little guide ,</l>
     <l n="267">Watching beside her , saw the hues of life</l>
     <l n="268">Fade from the fair smooth brow and rounded cheek ,</l>
     <l n="269">As fades the crimson from a morning cloud ,</l>
     <l n="270">Till they were white as marble , and the breath</l>
     <l n="271">Had ceased to come and go , yet knew she not</l>
     <l n="272">At first that this was death . But when she marked</l>
     <l n="273">How deep the paleness was , how motionless</l>
     <l n="274">That once lithe form , a fear came over her .</l>
     <l n="275">She strove to wake the sleeper , plucked her robe ,</l>
     <l n="276">And shouted in her ear , but all in vain ;</l>
     <l n="277">The life had passed away from those young limbs .</l>
     <l n="278">Then the snow-maiden raised a wailing cry ,</l>
     <l n="279">Such as the dweller in some lonely wild ,</l>
     <l n="280">Sleepless through all the long December night ,</l>
     <l n="281">Hears when the mournful East begins to blow .</l>
     <l n="282">But suddenly was heard the sound of steps ,</l>
     <l n="283">Grating on the crisp snow ; the cottagers</l>
     <l n="284">Were seeking Eva ; from afar they saw</l>
     <l n="285">The twain , and hurried toward them . As they came</l>
     <l n="286">With gentle chidings ready on their lips ,</l>
     <l n="287">And marked that deathlike sleep , and heard the tale</l>
     <l n="288">Of the snow-maiden , mortal anguish fell</l>
     <l n="289">Upon their hearts , and bitter words of grief</l>
     <l n="290">And blame were uttered : “ Cruel , cruel one ,</l>
     <l n="291">To tempt our daughter thus , and cruel we ,</l>
     <l n="292">Who suffered her to wander forth alone</l>
     <l n="293">In this fierce cold ! ” They lifted the dear child ,</l>
     <l n="294">And bore her home and chafed her tender limbs ,</l>
     <l n="295">And strove , by all the simple arts they knew ,</l>
     <l n="296">To make the chilled blood move , and win the breath</l>
     <l n="297">Back to her bosom ; fruitlessly they strove ;</l>
     <l n="298">The little maid was dead . In blank despair</l>
     <l n="299">They stood , and gazed at her who never more</l>
     <l n="300">Should look on them . “ Why die we not with her ? ”</l>
     <l n="301">They said ; “ without her , life is bitterness . ”</l>
     <l n="302">Now came the funeral-day ; the simple folk</l>
     <l n="303">Of all that pastoral region gathered round</l>
     <l n="304">To share the sorrow of the cottagers .</l>
     <l n="305">They carved a way into the mound of snow</l>
     <l n="306">To the glen 's side , and dug a little grave</l>
     <l n="307">In the smooth slope , and , following the bier ,</l>
     <l n="308">In long procession from the silent door ,</l>
     <l n="309">Chanted a sad and solemn melody :</l>
     <l n="310">“ Lay her away to rest within the ground .</l>
     <l n="311">Yea , lay her down whose pure and innocent life</l>
     <l n="312">Was spotless as these snows ; for she was reared</l>
     <l n="313">In love , and passed in love life 's pleasant spring ,</l>
     <l n="314">And all that now our tenderest love can do</l>
     <l n="315">Is to give burial to her lifeless limbs . ”</l>
     <l n="316">They paused . A thousand slender voices round ,</l>
     <l n="317">Like echoes softly flung from rock and hill ,</l>
     <l n="318">Took up the strain , and all the hollow air</l>
     <l n="319">Seemed mourning for the dead ; for , on that day ,</l>
     <l n="320">The Little People of the Snow had come ,</l>
     <l n="321">From mountain-peak , and cloud , and icy hall ,</l>
     <l n="322">To Eva 's burial . As the murmur died ,</l>
     <l n="323">The funeral-train renewed the solemn chant :</l>
     <l n="324">“ Thou , Lord , hast taken her to be with Eve ,</l>
     <l n="325">Whose gentle name was given her . Even so ,</l>
     <l n="326">For so Thy wisdom saw that it was best</l>
     <l n="327">For her and us . We bring our bleeding hearts ,</l>
     <l n="328">And ask the touch of healing from Thy hand ,</l>
     <l n="329">As , with submissive tears , we render back</l>
     <l n="330">The lovely and beloved to Him who gave . ”</l>
     <l n="331">They ceased . Again the plaintive murmur rose .</l>
     <l n="332">From shadowy skirts of low-hung cloud it came ,</l>
     <l n="333">And wide white fields , and fir-trees capped with snow ,</l>
     <l n="334">Shivering to the sad sounds . They sank away</l>
     <l n="335">To silence in the dim-seen distant woods .</l>
     <l n="336">The little grave was closed ; the funeral-train</l>
     <l n="337">Departed ; winter wore away ; the Spring</l>
     <l n="338">Steeped , with her quickening rains , the violet-tufts ,</l>
     <l n="339">By fond hands planted where the maiden slept .</l>
     <l n="340">But , after Eva 's burial , never more</l>
     <l n="341">The Little People of the Snow were seen</l>
     <l n="342">By human eye , nor ever human ear</l>
     <l n="343">Heard from their lips articulate speech again ;</l>
     <l n="344">For a decree went forth to cut them off ,</l>
     <l n="345">Forever , from communion with mankind .</l>
     <l n="346">The winter-clouds , along the mountain-side ,</l>
     <l n="347">Rolled downward toward the vale , but no fair form</l>
     <l n="348">Leaned from their folds , and , in the icy glens ,</l>
     <l n="349">And aged woods , under snow-loaded pines ,</l>
     <l n="350">Where once they made their haunt , was emptiness .</l>
     <l n="351">But ever , when the wintry days drew near ,</l>
     <l n="352">Around that little grave , in the long night ,</l>
     <l n="353">Frost-wreaths were laid and tufts of silvery rime</l>
     <l n="354">In shape like blades and blossoms of the field ,</l>
     <l n="355">As one would scatter flowers upon a bier .</l>

    <head>THE FLOOD OF YEARS .</head>
     <l n="1">A mighty Hand , from an exhaustless Urn ,</l>
     <l n="2">Pours forth the never-ending Flood of Years ,</l>
     <l n="3">Among the nations . How the rushing waves</l>
     <l n="4">Bear all before them ! On their foremost edge ,</l>
     <l n="5">And there alone , is Life . The Present there</l>
     <l n="6">Tosses and foams , and fills the air with roar</l>
     <l n="7">Of mingled noises . There are they who toil ,</l>
     <l n="8">And they who strive , and they who feast , and they</l>
     <l n="9">Who hurry to and fro . The sturdy swain —</l>
     <l n="10">Woodman and delver with the spade — is there ,</l>
     <l n="11">And busy artisan beside his bench ,</l>
     <l n="12">And pallid student with his written roll .</l>
     <l n="13">A moment on the mounting billow seen ,</l>
     <l n="14">The flood sweeps over them and they are gone .</l>
     <l n="15">There groups of revellers whose brows are twined</l>
     <l n="16">With roses , ride the topmost swell awhile ,</l>
     <l n="17">And as they raise their flowing cups and touch</l>
     <l n="18">The clinking brim to brim , are whirled beneath</l>
     <l n="19">The waves and disappear . I hear the jar</l>
     <l n="20">Of beaten drums , and thunders that break forth</l>
     <l n="21">From cannon , where the advancing billow sends</l>
     <l n="22">Up to the sight long files of armèd men ,</l>
     <l n="23">That hurry to the charge through flame and smoke .</l>
     <l n="24">The torrent bears them under , whelmed and hid</l>
     <l n="25">Slayer and slain , in heaps of bloody foam .</l>
     <l n="26">Down go the steed and rider , the plumed chief</l>
     <l n="27">Sinks with his followers ; the head that wears</l>
     <l n="28">The imperial diadem goes down beside</l>
     <l n="29">The felon 's with cropped ear and branded cheek .</l>
     <l n="30">A funeral-train — the torrent sweeps away</l>
     <l n="31">Bearers and bier and mourners . By the bed</l>
     <l n="32">Of one who dies men gather sorrowing ,</l>
     <l n="33">And women weep aloud ; the flood rolls on ;</l>
     <l n="34">The wail is stifled and the sobbing group</l>
     <l n="35">Borne under . Hark to that shrill , sudden shout ,</l>
     <l n="36">The cry of an applauding multitude ,</l>
     <l n="37">Swayed by some loud-voiced orator who wields</l>
     <l n="38">The living mass as if he were its soul !</l>
     <l n="39">The waters choke the shout and all is still .</l>
     <l n="40">Lo ! next a kneeling crowd , and one who spreads</l>
     <l n="41">The hands in prayer — the engulfing wave o'ertakes</l>
     <l n="42">And swallows them and him . A sculptor wields</l>
     <l n="43">The chisel , and the stricken marble grows</l>
     <l n="44">To beauty ; at his easel , eager-eyed ,</l>
     <l n="45">A painter stands , and sunshine at his touch</l>
     <l n="46">Gathers upon his canvas , and life glows ;</l>
     <l n="47">A poet , as he paces to and fro ,</l>
     <l n="48">Murmurs his sounding lines . Awhile they ride</l>
     <l n="49">The advancing billow , till its tossing crest</l>
     <l n="50">Strikes them and flings them under , while their tasks</l>
     <l n="51">Are yet unfinished . See a mother smile</l>
     <l n="52">On her young babe that smiles to her again ;</l>
     <l n="53">The torrent wrests it from her arms ; she shrieks</l>
     <l n="54">And weeps , and midst her tears is carried down .</l>
     <l n="55">A beam like that of moonlight turns the spray</l>
     <l n="56">To glistening pearls ; two lovers , hand in hand ,</l>
     <l n="57">Rise on the billowy swell and fondly look</l>
     <l n="58">Into each other 's eyes . The rushing flood</l>
     <l n="59">Flings them apart : the youth goes down ; the maid</l>
     <l n="60">With hands outstretched in vain , and streaming eyes ,</l>
     <l n="61">Waits for the next high wave to follow him .</l>
     <l n="62">An aged man succeeds ; his bending form</l>
     <l n="63">Sinks slowly . Mingling with the sullen stream</l>
     <l n="64">Gleam the white locks , and then are seen no more .</l>
     <l n="65">Lo ! wider grows the stream — a sea-like flood</l>
     <l n="66">Saps earth 's walled cities ; massive palaces</l>
     <l n="67">Crumble before it ; fortresses and towers</l>
     <l n="68">Dissolve in the swift waters ; populous realms</l>
     <l n="69">Swept by the torrent see their ancient tribes</l>
     <l n="70">Engulfed and lost ; their very languages</l>
     <l n="71">Stifled , and never to be uttered more .</l>
     <l n="72">I pause and turn my eyes , and looking back</l>
     <l n="73">Where that tumultuous flood has been , I see</l>
     <l n="74">The silent ocean of the Past , a waste</l>
     <l n="75">Of waters weltering over graves , its shores</l>
     <l n="76">Strewn with the wreck of fleets where mast and hull</l>
     <l n="77">Drop away piecemeal ; battlemented walls</l>
     <l n="78">Frown idly , green with moss , and temples stand</l>
     <l n="79">Unroofed , forsaken by the worshipper .</l>
     <l n="80">There lie memorial stones , whence time has gnawed</l>
     <l n="81">The graven legends , thrones of kings o'erturned ,</l>
     <l n="82">The broken altars of forgotten gods ,</l>
     <l n="83">Foundations of old cities and long streets</l>
     <l n="84">Where never fall of human foot is heard ,</l>
     <l n="85">On all the desolate pavement . I behold</l>
     <l n="86">Dim glimmerings of lost jewels , far within</l>
     <l n="87">The sleeping waters , diamond , sardonyx ,</l>
     <l n="88">Ruby and topaz , pearl and chrysolite ,</l>
     <l n="89">Once glittering at the banquet on fair brows</l>
     <l n="90">That long ago were dust , and all around</l>
     <l n="91">Strewn on the surface of that silent sea</l>
     <l n="92">Are withering bridal wreaths , and glossy locks</l>
     <l n="93">Shorn from dear brows , by loving hands , and scrolls</l>
     <l n="94">O'er written , haply with fond words of love</l>
     <l n="95">And vows of friendship , and fair pages flung</l>
     <l n="96">Fresh from the printer 's engine . There they lie</l>
     <l n="97">A moment , and then sink away from sight .</l>
     <l n="98">I look , and the quick tears are in my eyes ,</l>
     <l n="99">For I behold in every one of these</l>
     <l n="100">A blighted hope , a separate history</l>
     <l n="101">Of human sorrows , telling of dear ties</l>
     <l n="102">Suddenly broken , dreams of happiness</l>
     <l n="103">Dissolved in air , and happy days too brief</l>
     <l n="104">That sorrowfully ended , and I think</l>
     <l n="105">How painfully must the poor heart have beat</l>
     <l n="106">In bosoms without number , as the blow</l>
     <l n="107">Was struck that slew their hope and broke their peace .</l>
     <l n="108">Sadly I turn and look before , where yet</l>
     <l n="109">The Flood must pass , and I behold a mist</l>
     <l n="110">Where swarm dissolving forms , the brood of Hope ,</l>
     <l n="111">Divinely fair , that rest on banks of flowers ,</l>
     <l n="112">Or wander among rainbows , fading soon</l>
     <l n="113">And reappearing , haply giving place</l>
     <l n="114">To forms of grisly aspect such as Fear</l>
     <l n="115">Shapes from the idle air — where serpents lift</l>
     <l n="116">The head to strike , and skeletons stretch forth</l>
     <l n="117">The bony arm in menace . Further on</l>
     <l n="118">A belt of darkness seems to bar the way</l>
     <l n="119">Long , low , and distant , where the Life to come</l>
     <l n="120">Touches the Life that is . The Flood of Years</l>
     <l n="121">Rolls toward it near and nearer . It must pass</l>
     <l n="122">That dismal barrier . What is there beyond ?</l>
     <l n="123">Hear what the wise and good have said . Beyond</l>
     <l n="124">That belt of darkness , still the Years roll on</l>
     <l n="125">More gently , but with not less mighty sweep .</l>
     <l n="126">They gather up again and softly bear</l>
     <l n="127">All the sweet lives that late were overwhelmed</l>
     <l n="128">And lost to sight , all that in them was good ,</l>
     <l n="129">Noble , and truly great , and worthy of love —</l>
     <l n="130">The lives of infants and ingenuous youths ,</l>
     <l n="131">Sages and saintly women who have made</l>
     <l n="132">Their households happy ; all are raised and borne</l>
     <l n="133">By that great current in its onward sweep ,</l>
     <l n="134">Wandering and rippling with caressing waves</l>
     <l n="135">Around green islands with the breath</l>
     <l n="136">Of flowers that never wither . So they pass</l>
     <l n="137">From stage to stage along the shining course</l>
     <l n="138">Of that bright river , broadening like a sea .</l>
     <l n="139">As its smooth eddies curl along their way</l>
     <l n="140">They bring old friends together ; hands are clasped</l>
     <l n="141">In joy unspeakable ; the mother 's arms</l>
     <l n="142">Again are folded round the child she loved</l>
     <l n="143">And lost . Old sorrows are forgotten now ,</l>
     <l n="144">Or but remembered to make sweet the hour</l>
     <l n="145">That overpays them ; wounded hearts that bled</l>
     <l n="146">Or broke are healed forever . In the room</l>
     <l n="147">Of this grief-shadowed present , there shall be</l>
     <l n="148">A Present in whose reign no grief shall gnaw</l>
     <l n="149">The heart , and never shall a tender tie</l>
     <l n="150">Be broken ; in whose reign the eternal Change</l>
     <l n="151">That waits on growth and action shall proceed</l>
     <l n="152">With everlasting Concord hand in hand .</l>

    <p n="3">In this poem , written and first printed in the year 1821 , the author has endeavored , from a survey of the past ages of the world , and of the successive advances of mankind in knowledge , virtue , and happiness , to justify and confirm the hopes of the philanthropist for the future destinies of the human race .</p>

    <p n="5">THE BURIAL-PLACE .</p>
    <p n="6">The first half of this fragment may seem to the reader borrowed from the essay on Rural Funerals in the fourth number of “ The Sketch-book . ” The lines were , however , written more than a year before that number appeared . The poem , unfinished as it is , would hardly have been admitted into this collection , had not the author been unwilling to lose what had the honor of resembling so beautiful a composition .</p>

    <p n="8">THE MASSACRE AT SCIO .</p>
    <p n="9">This poem , written about the time of the horrible butchery of the Sciotes by the Turks , in 1824 , has been more fortunate than most poetical predictions . The independence of the Greek nation which it foretold , has come to pass , and the massacre , by inspiring a deeper detestation of their oppressors , did much to promote that event .</p>

    <p n="14">MONUMENT MOUNTAIN .</p>
    <p n="15">The mountain called by this name is a remarkable precipice in Great Barrington , overlooking the rich and picturesque valley of the Housatonic , in the western part of Massachusetts . At the southern extremity is , or was a few years since , a conical pile of small stones , erected , according to the tradition of the surrounding country , by the Indians , in memory of a woman of the Stockbridge tribe who killed herself by leaping from the edge of the precipice . Until within a few years past , small parties of that tribe used to arrive from their settlement in the western part of the State of New York , on visits to Stockbridge , the place of their nativity and former residence . A young woman belonging to one of these parties related , to a friend of the author , the story on which the poem of Monument Mountain is founded . An Indian girl had formed an attachment for her cousin , which , according to the customs of the tribe , was unlawful . She was , in consequence , seized with a deep melancholy , and resolved to destroy herself . In company with a female friend , she repaired to the mountain , decked out for the occasion in all her ornaments , and , after passing the day on the summit in singing with her companion the traditional songs of her nation , she threw herself headlong from the rock , and was killed .</p>

    <p n="17">THE MURDERED TRAVELLER .</p>
    <p n="18">Some years since , in the month of May , the remains of a human body , partly devoured by wild animals , were found in a woody ravine , near a solitary road passing between the mountains west of the village of Stockbridge . It was supposed that the person came to his death by violence , but no traces could be discovered of his murderers . It was only recollected that one evening , in the course of the previous winter , a traveller had stopped at an inn in the village of West Stockbridge : that he had inquired the way to Stockbridge ; and that , in paying the innkeeper for something he had ordered , it appeared that he had a considerable sum of money in his possession . Two ill-looking men were present , and went out about the same time that the traveller proceeded on his journey . During the winter , also , two men of shabby appearance , but plentifully supplied with money , had lingered for a while about the village of Stockbridge . Several years afterward , a criminal , about to be executed for a capital offence in Canada , confessed that he had been concerned in murdering a traveller in Stockbridge for the sake of his money . Nothing was ever discovered respecting the name or residence of the person murdered .</p>

    <p n="20">Chained in the market-place he stood , etc .</p>
    <p n="21">The story of the African chief , related in this ballad , may be found in the African Repository for April , 1825 . The subject of it was a warrior of majestic stature , the brother of Yarradee , king of the Solima nation . He had been taken in battle , and was brought in chains for sale to the Rio Pongas , where he was exhibited in the market-place , his ankles still adorned with massy rings of gold which he wore when captured . The refusal of his captors to listen to his offers of ransom drove him mad , and he died a maniac .</p>

    <p n="23">THE CONJUNCTION OF JUPITER AND VENUS .</p>
    <p n="24">This conjunction was said in the common calendars to have taken place on the 2d of August , 1826 . This , I believe , was an error , but the apparent approach of the planets was sufficiently near for poetical purposes .</p>

    <p n="32">The slim papaya ripens , etc .</p>
    <p n="33">Papaya — papaw , custard-apple . Flint , in his excellent work on the Geography and History of the Western States , thus describes this tree and its fruit :</p>
    <p n="34">“ A papaw-shrub hanging full of fruits , of a size and weight so disproportioned to the stem , and from under long and rich-looking leaves , of the same yellow with the ripened fruit , and of an African luxuriance of growth , is to us one of the richest spectacles that we have ever contemplated in the array of the woods . The fruit contains from two to six seeds like those of the tamarind , except that they are double the size . The pulp of the fruit resembles egg-custard in consistence and appearance . It has the same creamy feeling in the mouth , and unites the taste of eggs , cream , sugar , and spice . It is a natural custard , too luscious for the relish of most people . ”</p>
    <p n="35">Chateaubriand , in his Travels , speaks disparagingly of the fruit of the papaw ; but on the authority of Mr. Flint , who must know more of the matter , I have ventured to make my Western lover enumerate it among the delicacies of the wilderness .</p>

    <p n="37">The surface rolls and fluctuates to the eye .</p>
    <p n="38">The prairies of the West , with an undulating surface , rolling prairies , as they are called , present to the unaccustomed eye a singular spectacle when the shadows of the clouds are passing rapidly over them . The face of the ground seems to fluctuate and toss like billows of the sea .</p>

    <p n="49">SONG OF MARION 'S MEN .</p>
    <p n="50">The exploits of General Francis Marion , the famous partisan warrior of South Carolina , form an interesting chapter in the annals of the American Revolution . The British troops were so harassed by the irregular and successful warfare which he kept up at the head of a few daring followers , that they sent an officer to remonstrate with him for not coming into the open field and fighting “ like a gentleman and a Christian . ”</p>

    <p n="52">MARY MAGDALEN .</p>
    <p n="53">Several learned divines , with much appearance of reason , in particular Dr. Lardner , have maintained that the common notion respecting the dissolute life of Mary Magdalen is erroneous , and that she was always a person of excellent character . Charles Taylor , the editor of “ Calmet 's Dictionary of the Bible ” takes the same view of the subject .</p>
    <p n="54">The verses of the Spanish poet here translated refer to the “ woman who had been a sinner , ” mentioned in the seventh chapter of St. Luke 's Gospel , and who is commonly confounded with Mary Magdalen .</p>
    <p n="55">Page 142 .</p>
    <p n="56">FATIMA AND RADUAN .</p>
    <p n="57">This and the following poems belong to that class of ancient Spanish ballads , by unknown authors , called Romances Moriscos — Moriscan Romances or ballads . They were composed in the fourteenth century , some of them , probably , by the Moors , who then lived intermingled with the Christians ; and they relate the loves and achievements of the knights of Granada .</p>

    <p n="62">These eyes shall not recall thee , etc .</p>
    <p n="63">This is the very expression of the original — No te llamarán mis ojos , etc . The Spanish poets early adopted the practice of calling a lady by the name of the most expressive feature of her countenance , her eyes . The lover styled his mistress “ ojos bellos , ” beautiful eyes ; “ ojos serenos , ” serene eyes . Green eyes seem to have been anciently thought a great beauty in Spain , and there is a very pretty ballad by an absent lover , in which he addressed his lady by the title of “ green eyes ; ” supplicating that he may remain in her remembrance :</p>
    <p n="64">“ ¡ Ay ojuelos verdes ! Ay los mis ojuelos ! Ay , hagan los cielos Que de mi te acuerdes ! ”</p>
    <p n="65">Page 147 .</p>
    <p n="66">Say , Love — for didst thou see her tears , etc .</p>
    <p n="67">The stanza beginning with this line stands thus in the original :</p>
    <p n="68">“ Dilo tu , amor , si lo viste ; ¡ Mas ay ! que de lastimado Diste otro nudo a la venda , Para no ver lo que la pasado . ”</p>
    <p n="69">I am sorry to find so poor a conceit deforming so spirited a composition as this old ballad , but I have preserved it in the version . It is one of those extravagances which afterward became so common in Spanish poetry , when Gongora introduced the estilo culto , as it was called .</p>

Tous nostres cors vendran essuchs , come fa l'eska , Lous Aubres leyssaran lour verdour tendra e fresca , Lous Ausselets del bosc perdran lour kant subtyeu , E non s'auzira plus lou Rossignol gentyeu .

    <p n="81">EARTH .</p>
    <p n="82">The author began this poem in rhyme . The following is the first draught of it as far as he proceeded , in a stanza which he found it convenient to abandon :</p>
    <p n="83">A midnight black with clouds is on the sky ; A shadow like the first original night Folds in , and seems to press me as I lie ; No image meets the vainly wandering sight , And shot through rolling mists no starlight gleam Glances on glassy pool or rippling stream .</p>
    <p n="84">No ruddy blaze , from dwellings bright within , Tinges the flowering summits of the grass ; No sound of life is heard , no village din , Wings rustling overhead or steps that pass , While , on the breast of Earth at random thrown , I listen to her mighty voice alone .</p>
    <p n="85">A voice of many tones : deep murmurs sent From waters that in darkness glide away , From woods unseen by sweeping breezes bent , From rocky chasms where darkness dwells all day , And hollows of the invisible hills around , Blent in one ceaseless , melancholy sound .</p>
    <p n="86">O Earth ! dost thou , too , sorrow for the past ? Mourn'st thou thy childhood 's unreturning hours , Thy springs , that briefly bloomed and faded fast , The gentle generations of thy flowers , Thy forests of the elder time , decayed And gone with all the tribes that loved their shade ?</p>
    <p n="87">Mourn'st thou that first fair time so early lost , The golden age that lives in poets ’ strains , Ere hail or lightning , whirlwind , flood , or frost Scathed thy green breast , or earthquakes whelmed thy plains , Ere blood upon the shuddering ground was spilt , Or night was haunted by disease and guilt ?</p>
    <p n="88">Or haply dost thou grieve for those who die ? For living things that trod a while thy face , The love of thee and heaven , and now they lie Mixed with the shapeless dust the wild winds chase ? I , too , must grieve , for never on thy sphere Shall those bright forms and faces reappear .</p>
    <p n="89">Ha ! with a deeper and more thrilling tone , Rises that voice around me : ‘ tis the cry Of Earth for guilt and wrong , the eternal moan Sent to the listening and long-suffering sky , I hear and tremble , and my heart grows faint , As midst the night goes up that great complaint .</p>
    <p n="90">Page 174 .</p>
    <p n="91">Where Isar 's clay-white rivulets run Through the dark woods like frighted deer .</p>
    <p n="92">Close to the city of Munich , in Bavaria , lies the spacious and beautiful pleasure-ground , called the English Garden , in which these lines were written , originally projected and laid out by our countryman , Count Rumford , under the auspices of one of the sovereigns of the country . Winding walks , of great extent , pass through close thickets and groves interspersed with lawns ; and streams , diverted from the river Isar , traverse the grounds swiftly in various directions , the water of which , stained with the clay of the soil it has corroded in its descent from the upper country , is frequently of a turbid-white color .</p>

    <p n="97">THE CHILD 'S FUNERAL .</p>
    <p n="98">The incident on which this poem is founded was related to the author while in Europe , in a letter from an English lady . A child died in the south of Italy , and when they went to bury it they found it revived and playing with the flowers which , after the manner of that country , had been brought to grace his funeral .</p>

    <p n="101">Shortly before the death of Schiller , he was seized with a strong desire to travel in foreign countries , as if his spirit had a presentiment of its approaching enlargement , and already longed to expatiate in a wider and more varied sphere of existence .</p>

    <p n="107">The small tree , named by the botanists Aronia Botyrapium , is called , in some parts of our country , the shad-bush , from the circumstance that it flowers about the time that the shad ascend the rivers in early spring . Its delicate sprays , covered with white blossoms before the trees are yet in leaf , have a singularly beautiful appearance in the woods .</p>

    <p n="110">I remember hearing an aged man , in the country , compare the slow movement of time in early life , and its swift flight as it approaches old age , to the drumming of a partridge or ruffed grouse in the woods — the strokes falling slow and distinct at first , and following each other more and more rapidly , till they end at last in a whirring sound .</p>

This white extremity was divided , upon the sides of the foot , by the general color of the leg , which extends down near to the hoofs , leaving a white triangle in front , of which the point was elevated rather higher than the spurious hoofs . ” — GODMAN 'S Natural History , vol . ii ., p. 314 .</p>

    <p n="128">Readers who are acquainted with the Spanish language , may not be displeased at seeing the original of this little poem :</p>
    <p n="129">EL PÁJARO PERDIDO .</p>
    <p n="130">Huyó con vuelo incierto , Y de mis ojos ha desparecido . Mirad , si , á vuestro huerto , Mi pájaro querido , Niñas hermosas , por acaso ha huido .</p>
    <p n="131">Sus ojos relucientes Son como los del águila orgullosa ; Plumas resplandecientes , En la cabeza airosa , Lleva ; y su voz es tierna y armoniosa .</p>
    <p n="132">Mirad , si cuidadoso Junto á las flores se escondió en la grama . Ese laurel frondoso Mirad , rama por rama , Que él los laureles y los flores ama .</p>
    <p n="133">Si le halláis , por ventura , No os enamore su amoroso acento ; No os prende su hermosura ; Volvédmele al momento ; O dejadle , si no , libre en el viento .</p>
    <p n="134">Por que su pico de oro Solo en mi mano toma la semilla ; Y no enjugaré el lloro Que veis en mi mejilla , Hasta encontrar mi prófugo avecilla .</p>
    <p n="135">Mi vista se oscurece , Si sus ojos no ve , que son mi día Mi ánima desfallece Con la melancolía De no escucharle ya su melodía .</p>
    <p n="136">The literature of Spain at the present day has this peculiarity , that female writers have , in considerable number , entered into competition with the other sex . One of the most remarkable of these , as a writer of both prose and poetry , is Carolina Coronado de Perry , the author of the little poem here given . The poetical literature of Spain has felt the influence of the female mind in the infusion of a certain delicacy and tenderness , and the more frequent choice of subjects which interest the domestic affections . Concerning the verses of the lady already mentioned , Don Juan Eugenio Hartzenbusch , one of the most accomplished Spanish critics of the present day , and himself a successful dramatic writer , says :</p>
    <p n="137">“ If Carolina Coronado had , through modesty , sent her productions from Estremadura to Madrid under the name of a person of the other sex , it would still have been difficult for intelligent readers to persuade themselves that they were written by a man , or at least , considering their graceful sweetness , purity of tone , simplicity of conception , brevity of development , and delicate and particular choice of subject , we should be constrained to attribute them to one yet in his early youth , whom the imagination would represent as ingenuous , innocent , and gay , who had scarce ever wandered beyond the flowery grove or pleasant valley where his cradle was rocked , and where he has been lulled to sleep by the sweetest songs of Francisea de la Torre , Garcilaso , and Melendez . ”</p>
    <p n="138">The author of the Pájaro Perdido , according to a memoir of her by Angel Fernandez de los Rios , was born at Almendralejo , in Estremadura , in 1823 . At the age of nine years she began to steal from sleep , after a day passed in various lessons , and in domestic occupations , several hours every night to read the poets of her country , and other books belonging to the library of the household , among which are mentioned , as a proof of her vehement love of reading , the “ Critical History of Spain , ” by the Abbé Masuden , “ and other works equally dry and prolix . ” She was afterward sent to Badajoz , where she received the best education which the state of the country , then on fire with a civil war , would admit . Here the intensity of her application to her studies caused a severe malady , which has frequently recurred in after-life . At the age of thirteen years she wrote a poem entitled La Palma , which the author of her biography declares to be worthy of Herrera , and which led Espronceda , a poet of Estremadura , a man of genius , and the author of several translations from Byron , whom he resembled both in mental and personal characteristics , to address her an eulogistic sonnet . In 1843 , when she was but twenty years old , a volume of her poems was published at Madrid , in which were included both that entitled La Palma and the one I have given in this note . To this volume Hartzenbusch , in his admiration for her genius , prefaced an introduction .</p>
    <p n="139">The task of writing verses in Spanish is not difficult . Rhymes are readily found , and the language is easily moulded into metrical forms . Those who have distinguished themselves in this literature have generally made their first essays in verse . What is remarkable enough , the men who afterward figured in political life mostly began their career as the authors of madrigals . A poem introduces the future statesman to the public , as a speech at a popular meeting introduces the candidate for political distinctions in this country . I have heard of but one of the eminent Spanish politicians of the present time , who made a boast that he was innocent of poetry ; and if all that his enemies say of him be true , it would have been well both for his country and his own fame , if he had been equally innocent of corrupt practices . The compositions of Carolina Coronado , even her earliest , do not deserve to be classed with the productions of which I have spoken , and which are simply the effect of inclination and facility . They possess the mens divinior .</p>
    <p n="140">In 1852 a collection of poems of Carolina Coronado was brought out at Madrid , including those which were first published . The subjects are of larger variety than those which prompted her earlier productions ; some of them are of a religious cast , others refer to political matters . One of them , which appears among the “ Improvisations , ” is an energetic protest against erecting a new amphitheatre for bull-fights . The spirit in all her poetry is humane and friendly to the best interests of mankind .</p>
    <p n="141">Her writings in prose must not be overlooked . Among them is a novel entitled Sigea , founded on the adventures of Camoëns ; another entitled Jarilla , a beautiful story , full of pictures of rural life in Estremadura , which deserves , if it could find a competent translator , to be transferred to our language . Besides these there are two other novels from her pen , Paquita and La Luz del Tejo . A few years since appeared , in a Madrid periodical , the Semanario , a series of letters written by her , giving an account of the impressions received in a journey from the Tagus to the Rhine , including a visit to England . Among the subjects on which she has written , is the idea , still warmly cherished in Spain , of uniting the entire peninsula under one government . In an ably-conducted journal of Madrid , she has given accounts of the poetesses of Spain , her contemporaries , with extracts from their writings , and a kindly estimate of their respective merits .</p>
    <p n="142">Her biographer speaks of her activity and efficiency in charitable enterprises , her interest in the cause of education , her visits to the primary schools of Madrid , encouraging and rewarding the pupils , and her patronage of the escuela de parvules , or infant school at Badajoz , established by a society of that city , with the design of improving the education of the laboring class .</p>
    <p n="143">It must have been not long after the publication of her poems , in 1852 , that Carolina Coronado became the wife of an American gentleman , Mr. Horatio J. Perry , at one time our Secretary of Legation at the Court of Madrid , afterward our Chargé d'Affaires , and now , in 1863 , again Secretary of Legation . Amid the duties of a wife and mother , which she fulfils with exemplary fidelity and grace , she has neither forgotten nor forsaken the literary pursuits which have given her so high a reputation .</p>

    <p n="146">The poems of the Spanish author , Francisco de Rioja , who lived in the first half of the seventeenth century , are few in number , but much esteemed . His ode on the Ruins of Italica is one of the most admired of these , but in the only collection of his poems which I have seen , it is said that the concluding stanza , in the original copy , was deemed so little worthy of the rest that it was purposely omitted in the publication . Italica was a city founded by the Romans in the south of Spain , the remains of which are still an object of interest .</p>

    <p n="148">SELLA .</p>
    <p n="149">Sella is the name given by the Vulgate to one of the wives of Lamech , mentioned in the fourth chapter of the Book of Genesis , and called Zillah in the corn-won English version of the Bible .</p>

    <p n="151">HOMER 'S ODYSSEY , BOOK V ., TRANSLATED .</p>
    <p n="152">It may be esteemed presumptuous in the author of this volume to attempt a translation of any part of Homer in blank verse after that of Cowper . It has always seemed to him , however , that Cowper 's version had very great defects . The style of Homer is simple , and he has been praised for fire and rapidity of narrative . Does anybody find these qualities in Cowper 's Homer ? If Cowper had rendered him into such English as he employed in his “ Task , ” there would be no reason to complain ; but in translating Homer he seems to have thought it necessary to use a different style from that of his original work . Almost every sentence is stiffened by some clumsy inversion ; stately phrases are used when simpler ones were at hand , and would have rendered the meaning of the original better . The entire version has the appearance of being hammered out with great labor , and as a whole it is cold and constrained ; scarce any thing seems spontaneous ; it is only now and then that the translator has caught the fervor of his author . Homer , of course , wrote in idiomatic Greek , and , in order to produce either a true copy of the original , or an agreeable poem , should have been translated into idiomatic English .</p>
    <p n="153">I am almost ashamed , after this censure of an author whom , in the main , I admire as much as I do Cowper , to refer to my own translation of the Fifth Book of the Odyssey . I desire barely to say that I have endeavored to give the verses of the old Greek poet at least a simpler presentation in English , and one more conformable to the genius of our language .</p>

    <p n="155">The mock-grape 's blood-red banner , etc .</p>
    <p n="156">Ampelopis , mock-grape . I have here literally translated the botanical name of the Virginia creeper — an appellation too cumbrous for verse .</p>

    <p n="158">A BRIGHTER DAY .</p>
    <p n="159">This poem was written shortly after the author 's return from a visit to Spain , and more than a twelvemonth before the overthrow of the tyrannical government of Queen Isabella and the expulsion of the Bourbons . It is not “ from the Spanish ” in the ordinary sense of the phrase , but is an attempt to put into a poetic form sentiments and hopes which the author frequently heard , during his visit to Spain , from the lips of the natives . We are yet to see whether these expectations of an enlightened government and national liberty are to become a reality under the new order of things .</p>
