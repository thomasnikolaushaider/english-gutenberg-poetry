     <head>AUTHOR 'S PREFACE</head>
     <p>THE Lithuanian nation , formed out of the tribes of the Litwini , Prussians and Leti , not very numerous , settled in an inextensive country , not very fertile , long unknown to Europe , was called , about the thirteenth century , by the incursions of its neighbours , to a more active part . When the Prussians submitted to the swords of the Teutonic knights , the Lithuanians , issuing from their forests and marshes , annihilated with sword and fire the neighbouring empires , and soon became terrible in the north . History has not as yet satisfactorily explained by what means a nation so weak , and so long tributary to foreigners , was able all at once to oppose and threaten all its enemies — on one side , carrying on a constant and murderous war with the Teutonic Order ; on the other , plundering Poland , exacting tribute from Great Novgorod , and pushing itself as far as the borders of the Wolga and the Crimean peninsula . The brightest period of Lithuanian history occurs in the time of Olgierd and Witold , whose rule extended from the Baltic to the Black Sea . But this monstrous empire , having sprung up too quickly , could not create in itself internal strength , to unite and invigorate its differing portions . The Lithuanian nationality , spread over too large a surface of territory , lost its proper character . The Litwini subjugated many Russian tribes , and entered into political relations with Poland . The Slavs , long since Christians , stood in a higher degree of civilisation , and although conquered , or threatened by Lithuania , gained by gradual influence a moral preponderance over their strong , but barbarous tyrants , and absorbed them , as the Chinese their Tartar invaders . The Jagellons , and their more powerful vassals , became Poles ; many Lithuanian princes adopted the Russian religion , language , and nationality . By these means the Grand Duchy of Lithuania ceased to be Lithuanian ; the nation proper found itself within its former boundaries , its speech ceased to be the language of the court and nobility , and was only preserved among the common people . Litwa presents the singular spectacle of a people which disappeared in the immensity of its conquests , as a brook sinks after an excessive overflow , and flows in a narrower bed than before .</p>
     <p>The circumstances here mentioned are covered by some centuries . Both Lithuania , and her cruellest enemy , the Teutonic Order , have disappeared from the scene of political life ; the relations between neighbouring nations are entirely changed ; the interests and passions which kindled the wars of that time are now expired ; even popular song has not preserved their memory . Litwa is now entirely in the past : her history presents from this circumstance a happy theme for poetry ; so that a poet , in singing of the events of that time , objects only of historic interest , must occupy himself with searching into , and with artfully rendering the subject , without summoning to his aid the interests , passions , or fashions of his readers . For such subjects Schiller recommended poets to seek .</p>

      <head>TRANSLATOR 'S PREFACE</head>
      <head>THE Teutonic Order , originally , like the Knights Hospitallers , established in the Holy Land about 1199 , settled , after the cessation of the Crusades , in the country bordering upon the Baltic Sea , at the mouth of the Vistula , in the year 1225 . The possession of the Baltic shores , and of such lands as the Order should conquer from the pagan Prussians and Litwini , was assured to them by Konrad , Duke of Masowsze , brother to Leszek the White of Poland . The fatal error thus committed , in abandoning a hold on the sea-coast , had afterwards a disastrous effect on the history of Poland . The Order speedily made themselves masters of the whole country of Prussia , and were engaged in ceaseless war with the pagans of Lithuania , under pretext of their conversion ; more frequently , it is however to be feared , for purposes of raid and plunder . It is , in fact , upon record that a certain Lithuanian prince , who had offered to embrace Christianity for the purpose of recovering part of his territory conquered by the Order , upon finding that his conversion would produce no better disposition in them towards himself , declared his intention of abiding in paganism , with the remark that he saw it was no question of his faith , but of his possessions . The plundering expeditions of the Teutonic knights up country , in which many of the chivalry of all Europe frequently bore a part , were termed reyses . The English reader will remember how Chaucer 's knight had fought “ aboven alle nations in Pruce . ”</head>

     <p>After the conversion of Lithuania , and the union of that country with Poland , the Teutonic knights were frequently engaged in hostilities with both powers combined , sustaining in the year 1410 a terrible defeat at Tannenberg in E. Prussia , from the forces of Jagellon . In this battle it is worthy of note that the famous John Ziska was engaged . In 1466 Casimir Jagellon inflicted heavy losses on the Order . After its secularisation in 1521 , when the Grand-Master Albert embraced the reformed faith , the domains of E. Prussia were held as a fief from Poland . In 1657 Prussia became an independent state under Frederick William , the great Elector . It is curious to observe how the name of Prussia , originally that of a conquered , non-Germanic people , has become in our time that of the first German power in the world .</p>
     <p>The historical circumstances on which the poem of “ Konrad Wallenrod ” is founded are thus detailed at length by the author himself , in the following postscript to the work :—</p>
     <p>“ We have called our story historical , for the characters of the actors , and all the more important circumstances mentioned therein , are sketched according to history . The contemporary chronicles , in fragmentary and broken portions , must be filled out sometimes only by guesses and conjectures , in order to create some historic entirety from them . Although I have permitted myself conjectures in the history of Wallenrod , I hope to justify them by their likeness to truth . According to the chronicle , Konrad Wallenrod was not descended from the family of Wallenrod renowned in Germany , though he gave himself out as a member of it . He was said to have been born of some illicit connection . The royal chronicle says , ‘ Er war ein Pfaffenkind . ’ Concerning the character of this singular man , we read many and contradictory traditions . The greater number of the chroniclers reproach him with pride , cruelty , drunkenness , severity towards his subordinates , little zeal for religion , and even with hatred for ecclesiastics . ‘ Er war ein rechter Leuteschinder ( library of Wallenrod ) . Nach Krieg , Zank , und Hader hat sein Herz immer gestanden ; und ob er gleich ein Gott ergebener Mensch von wegen seines Ordens sein wollte , doch ist er allen frommen geistlichen Menschen Graueel gewesen . ( David Lucas ) . Er regierte nicht lange , denn Gott plagte ihn inwendig mit dem laufenden Feuer . ’ On the other hand , contemporary writers ascribe to him greatness of intellect , courage , nobility , and force of character ; since without rare qualities he could not have maintained his empire amid universal hatred and the disasters which he brought upon the Order . Let us now consider the proceedings of Wallenrod . When he assumed the rule of the Order , the season appeared favourable for war with Lithuania , for Witold had promised himself to lead the Germans to Wilna , and liberally repay them for their assistance . Wallenrod , however , delayed to go to war ; and , what was worse , offended Witold , and reposed such careless confidence in him , that this prince , having secretly become reconciled to Jagellon , not only departed from Prussia , but on the road , entering the German castles , burnt them as an enemy , and slaughtered the garrisons . In such an unimagined change of circumstances , it was needful to neglect the war , or undertake it with great prudence . The Grand-Master proclaimed a crusade , wasted the treasures of the Order in preparation — 5 , 000 , 000 marks — a sum at that time immeasurable , and marched towards Lithuania . He could have captured Wilna , if he had not wasted time in banquets and waiting for auxiliaries . Autumn came ; Wallenrod , leaving the camp without provisions , retired in the greatest disorder to Prussia . The chroniclers and later historians were not able to imagine the cause of this sudden departure , not finding in contemporary circumstances any cause therefor . Some have assigned the flight of Wallenrod to derangement of intellect . All the contradictions mentioned in the character and conduct of our hero may be reconciled with each other , if we suppose that he was a Lithuanian , and that he had entered the Order to take vengeance on it ; especially since his rule gave the severest shock to the power of the Order . We suppose that Wallenrod was Walter Stadion ( see note ) , shortening only by some years the time which passed between the departure of Walter from Lithuania , and the appearance of Konrad in Marienbourg . Wallenrod died suddenly in the year 1394 ; strange events were said to have accompanied his death . ‘ Er starb , ’ says the chronicle ; ‘ in Raserei ohne letzte Oehlung , ohne Priestersegen , kurz vor seinem Tode wuetheten Stuerme , Regensguesse , Wasserfluthen ; die Weichsel und die Nogat durchwuehlten ihre Daemme ; hingegen wuehlten die gewaesser sich eine neue Tiefe da , wo jetzt Pilau steht ! ’ Halban , or , as the chroniclers call him , Doctor Leander von Albanus , a monk , the solitary and inseparable companion of Wallenrod , though he assumed the appearance of piety , was according to the chroniclers a heretic , a pagan , and perhaps a wizard . Concerning Halban 's death , there are no certain accounts . Some write that he was drowned , others that he disappeared secretly , or was carried away by demons . I have drawn the chronicles chiefly from the works of Kotzebue , ‘ Preussens Geschichte , Belege und Erlaeuterungen . ’ Hartknoch , in calling Wallenrod ‘ unsinnig , ’ gives a very short account of him . ”</p>
     <p>As to the conditions under which the poem was written , it is perhaps needful to state that it was composed by Mickiewicz , during the term of his banishment into Russia , and was first published at St. Petersburg in the year 1828 . In the character of the hero of the story , and in various circumstances of the poem , it is impossible not to recognise the influence of Lord Byron 's poetry , which obtained so powerful an ascendency over the works and imaginations of the Continental romanticists , and had thus an influence over foreign literature not conceded in the poet 's own country . The Byronic character , however , presents a far nobler aspect in the hands of the present author than in those of its original creator ; for , instead of being the outcome of a mere morbid self-concentration , and brooding over personal wrongs , it is the result of a noble indignation for the sufferings of others , and is conjoined with a high purpose for good , even though such good be worked out by means in themselves doubtful or questionable .</p>
     <p>We cannot pass by the subject without saying a word as to the undercurrent of political meaning in “ Konrad Wallenrod , ” which fortunately escaped the rigid censorship of the Russian press . Lithuania , conquered and oppressed by the Teutonic Order , is Poland , subjugated by Russia ; and the numerous expressions of hatred for oppressors and love of an unhappy country woven into the substance of the narrative must be read as the utterances of a Pole against Russian tyranny . The underhand machinations of the concealed enemy against the state in which he is a powerful leader , may be held to figure that intricate web of intrigue and conspiracy which Russian liberalism is gradually weaving throughout the whole political system , and which is daily gaining influence and power . The character of Wallenrod is essentially the same as that of Cooper 's “ Spy ; ” but we cannot suppose that the author intended to hold up trickery and deceit as praiseworthy and honourable , even though it is the sad necessity of slaves to use treachery as their only weapon ; or that the Macchiavellian precept with which the story is headed is at all intended as one to be generally followed by seekers of political liberty against despotism . The end and aim of this , as of all the works of Mickiewicz , is to show us a great and noble soul , noble in spite of many errors and vices , striving to work out a high ideal , and the fulfilment of a noble purpose ; and to exhibit the heroism of renunciation of personal ease and enjoyment for the sake of the world 's or a nation 's good .</p>
     <p>In regard to the method used in the English version , it is only necessary to add that as far as possible verbal accuracy in rendering has been endeavoured after ; and an attempt , at least conscientious — whether or not partially successful must be left to the sentence of those qualified to form an opinion — has been made to reproduce as nearly as may be something of the original spirit In translating the main body of the narrative blank verse has been the medium employed , not as at all representing the beautiful and harmonious interchange of rhymes and play of rhythm so conspicuous in the Polish lines ; but as securing , by reason of freedom from the necessity for rhymes , a truer verbal rendering , and as being the measure par excellence best suited to English narrative verse . The “ Wajdelote 's Tale ” has for similar reasons been rendered into the same form , instead of being reproduced in the original hexameter stanza , as strange to the Polish as to the English tongue , wherein , despite the works of Longfellow and Clough , it can hardly be said to have yet become thoroughly naturalised . Most of the lyrics are translated into the same metres as the originals , with the sole exception of the ballad of Alpujara . This , as being upon a Spanish or Moorish subject , it was judged best to render into a form nearly resembling that of the ancient Spanish ballad , and employed by Bishop Percy in translation of the “ Rio Verde , ” and other poems from a like source . Moreover , the original “ Alpujara ” is couched in a metre which , though extremely well suited to the Polish tongue , is difficult of imitation in English ; or only to be imitated by great loss of accuracy in rendering .</p>
     <p>In concluding , the translator begs to express a hope that this humble effort to present , however feebly , to the reading public of Great Britain an image of the work of the greatest of Polish poets , may , not be wholly unacceptable . Any defects which the critical eye may note , must undoubtedly be laid rather to the charge of the copyist , than to the original of the great master . I dare , however , to trust , that the shadow of so great a name , and the sincere wish to contribute this slender homage to the memory of one of Europe 's most illustrious writers , may serve as an excuse for over-presumption .</p>

       <l n="4">Konrad invites the knights to festival .</l>

     <p>A hundred white cloaks wave around the board , On every mantle is the long black cross ,— These are the brethren , and behind them stand The young esquires to serve them , in a ring .</p>

       <l n="9">Silent sat Wallenrod , upon his elbow</l>

       <l n="12">Alternate here and there the cup 's light clash .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Whence come the Litwins ? From a nightly sally ;</l>
       <l n="2">From church and castle they have won rich spoils ,</l>
       <l n="3">And crowds of German slaves with fettered hands ,</l>
       <l n="4">Ropes on their necks , follow the victors ’ steeds .</l>
       <l n="5">They look towards Prussia and dissolve in tears ,</l>
       <l n="6">On Kowno look , commend their souls to God .</l>
       <l n="7">In midst of Kowno stretches Perun 's plain ;</l>
       <l n="8">The Litwin princes , there returned from conquest ,</l>
       <l n="9">Do burn the German knights in sacrifice. 12</l>
       <l n="10">Two captive knights untroubled ride to Kowno ,</l>
       <l n="11">One fair and young , the other bowed with years .</l>
       <l n="12">They in the battle left the German troops ,</l>
       <l n="13">Fled to the Litwins . Kiejstut did receive them ,</l>
       <l n="14">But led them to the castle under guard .</l>
       <l n="15">He asks their race , with what intent they come .</l>
       <l n="16">“ I know not , ” said the youth , “ my race or name ;</l>
       <l n="17">In childhood was I made the Germans ’ captive .</l>
       <l n="18">I recollect alone , somewhere in Litwa ,</l>
       <l n="19">Amid a great town stood my father 's house .</l>
       <l n="20">It was a wooden town on lofty hills ,</l>
       <l n="21">The house was of red brick . Around the hills</l>
       <l n="22">Murmured a wood of fir-trees on the plains ;</l>
       <l n="23">Among the woods a white lake gleamed afar .</l>
       <l n="24">One night a shout aroused us from our sleep ;</l>
       <l n="25">A fiery day dawned in the window , shook</l>
       <l n="26">The window-panes , and whirling wreaths of smoke</l>
       <l n="27">Burst forth within the house . We to the door .</l>
       <l n="28">Flames curled through all the streets , sparks fell like hail .</l>
       <l n="29">A horrid cry arose , ‘ To arms ! the Germans</l>
       <l n="30">Are in the town ! to arms ! ’ My father rushed</l>
       <l n="31">Forth with his sword ,— rushed forth — returned no more !</l>
       <l n="32">The Germans poured into the house . One seized me</l>
       <l n="33">And caught me to his saddle . What came further</l>
       <l n="34">I know not ; but long , long my mother 's shrieks</l>
       <l n="35">I heard ‘ mid clash of swords , ‘ mid fall of houses .</l>
       <l n="36">This cry long followed me , stayed in my ear ;</l>
       <l n="37">Even now when I view flames and falling houses ,</l>
       <l n="38">This cry wakes in my soul as echo wakes</l>
       <l n="39">In caverns after thunder 's voice . Behold</l>
       <l n="40">My memories all of Litwa and my parents .</l>
       <l n="41">Sometimes in dreams I view the honoured forms</l>
       <l n="42">Of mother , father , brethren ; but anew</l>
       <l n="43">Some cloud mysterious veils their features o'er ,</l>
       <l n="44">Thicker and darker growing evermore .</l>
       <l n="45">The years of childhood passed away . I lived</l>
       <l n="46">A German among Germans , and they gave me</l>
       <l n="47">The name of Walter , 13 Alf thereto as surname .</l>
       <l n="48">German the name , my soul remained Litvanian ;</l>
       <l n="49">Grief for my parents , for the strangers hatred</l>
       <l n="50">Remained . The Master Winrych in his palace</l>
       <l n="51">Reared me , himself did hold me to the font ,</l>
       <l n="52">Loved and caressed me as his very son .</l>
       <l n="53">But weary in his palace , from his knees</l>
       <l n="54">I fled unto the Wajdelote . That time</l>
       <l n="55">Among the Germans was a Litwin bard ,</l>
       <l n="56">Captive for many years ,— interpreter ,</l>
       <l n="57">He served the army . When he heard of me</l>
       <l n="58">That I was orphan and Litvanian ,</l>
       <l n="59">He told of Litwa , cheered my longing soul</l>
       <l n="60">With his caresses , song , and with the sound</l>
       <l n="61">Of the Litvanian speech . He often led me</l>
       <l n="62">To the grey Niemen 's shores ; from thence I joyed</l>
       <l n="63">To look upon my country 's well-loved mountains .</l>
       <l n="64">And when unto the castle we returned ,</l>
       <l n="65">He dried my tears to waken no suspicion :</l>
       <l n="66">He dried my tears , but kindled in me vengeance</l>
       <l n="67">Against the Germans . I remember well</l>
       <l n="68">How , when we came again into the castle ,</l>
       <l n="69">I sharpened secretly a knife , with what</l>
       <l n="70">Delight of vengeance cut I Winrych 's carpets ,</l>
       <l n="71">Or broke his mirrors , on his shining shield</l>
       <l n="72">Flung sand , or spit upon it . Later on ,</l>
       <l n="73">When grown near manhood , from Klajpedo 's port</l>
       <l n="74">I sailed with the old man to view the shores</l>
       <l n="75">Of Litwa . There I plucked my country 's flowers ;</l>
       <l n="76">Their magic fragrance woke within my soul</l>
       <l n="77">Some ancient , dark remembrance . With the fragrance</l>
       <l n="78">Intoxicated , seemed me that a child</l>
       <l n="79">Once more I grew , and in my parents ’ garden ,</l>
       <l n="80">Played with my little brothers . The old man</l>
       <l n="81">Assisted memory with his words , more lovely</l>
       <l n="82">Than herbs and flowers ,— painted the happy past ,</l>
       <l n="83">How sweet in native land ‘ mid friends and kin</l>
       <l n="84">To pass one 's youth , how many Litwin children</l>
       <l n="85">Knew not such bliss , in the Order 's fetters weeping .</l>
       <l n="86">I heard this on the plains , but on the beach ,</l>
       <l n="87">Where the white billows break with roaring breasts ,</l>
       <l n="88">And from their foamy throat cast streams of sand ,</l>
       <l n="89">‘ Thou seest , ’ the old man then was used to say ,</l>
       <l n="90">‘ The grassy carpet of this seaboard meadow .</l>
       <l n="91">The sand blows over it . These fragrant herbs ,</l>
       <l n="92">Thou seest , would pierce the deadly covering ,</l>
       <l n="93">By their brow 's strength . In vain , alas ! for now</l>
       <l n="94">Another hydra comes of gravel-dust ,</l>
       <l n="95">Spreads its white fins , subdues the living lands ,</l>
       <l n="96">Stretching its kingdom of wild desert round .</l>
       <l n="97">My son ! the gifts of spring are living cast</l>
       <l n="98">Into the grave . Behold ! they are conquered peoples ,</l>
       <l n="99">Our brothers the Litwini ! Son , this sand</l>
       <l n="100">Storm-driven from the sea , it is the Order . ’</l>
       <l n="101">My heart did pain me hearing , and I longed</l>
       <l n="102">To murder all Crusaders , or to fly</l>
       <l n="103">To Litwa ; but the old man checked my zeal .</l>
       <l n="104">‘ To free knights , ’ said he , ‘ it is free to choose ’</l>
       <l n="105">Their weapon , and with equal strength to fight</l>
       <l n="106">in open field . Thou art a slave ; the only</l>
       <l n="107">Weapon that slaves may use is treachery .</l>
       <l n="108">Remain awhile and learn the Germans ’ war-craft ;</l>
       <l n="109">Try thou to gain their confidence ; we later</l>
       <l n="110">Shall see what thing to do . ’ I was obedient</l>
       <l n="111">Unto the old man 's words — went with the Germans .</l>
       <l n="112">But in the first fight , scarce I viewed the standards ,</l>
       <l n="113">Scarce did I hear my , nation 's songs of war ,</l>
       <l n="114">I sprang unto our own ,— led the old man with me .</l>
       <l n="115">As the young falcon , severed from his nest ,</l>
       <l n="116">And nourished in a cage , although the fowlers</l>
       <l n="117">By cruel torments strip him of his reason ,</l>
       <l n="118">And send him forth to war on brother-falcons ;</l>
       <l n="119">Soon as he rises ‘ mid the clouds , soon as</l>
       <l n="120">His eyes o'erstretch the far unmeasured plains</l>
       <l n="121">Of his blue Fatherland , he breathes free air ,</l>
       <l n="122">And hears the rustle of his wings .— Return</l>
       <l n="123">Unto thy home , O fowler ! do not wait</l>
       <l n="124">To see the falcon in his narrow cage . ”</l>

       <l n="236">To think of Litwa 's future . “ Son , ” cries Kiejstut ,</l>
       <l n="237">“ Thou art an evil prophet ; thou hast reft</l>

       <l n="249">Even in happy moments some light shade</l>
       <l n="250">Of thought o'erhung his brow , but with Aldona</l>
       <l n="251">Serene was once his brow and visage tranquil ,</l>
       <l n="252">Aye welcoming her with smiles , with tender glance</l>
       <l n="253">Bidding farewell to her . Now , as it seemed ,</l>
       <l n="254">He was tormented by some hidden pain .</l>
       <l n="255">By morn , before the house , wringing his hands ,</l>
       <l n="256">He looked upon the smoke of towns and hamlets ,</l>
       <l n="257">Burning far off ; there gazed he with wild eyes .</l>
       <l n="258">By night he started out of sleep , and looked</l>
       <l n="259">Forth from the window on the blood-red blaze .</l>
       <l n="260">“ Husband , what ails thee ? ” asks with tears Aldona .</l>
       <l n="261">“ What ails me ? Shall I peaceful sleep till Germans</l>
       <l n="262">Shall give me sleeping , bound , to hangman 's hands ? ”</l>
       <l n="263">“ O husband ! Heaven forbid ! The sentries guard</l>

       <l n="265">I watch and grasp the sabre in my hand .</l>
       <l n="266">But when the sentries die the sword is broken .</l>
       <l n="267">List , if I live to old age , wretched age —— ”</l>
       <l n="268">“ But Heaven will give us comfort in our children . ”</l>
       <l n="269">“ The Germans will fall on us , slay the wife ,</l>
       <l n="270">The children tear away , and lead them far ,</l>
       <l n="271">Teach them to loose the arrow on their father .</l>
       <l n="272">Myself my father , brothers , might have slain ,</l>
       <l n="273">Unless the Wajdelote —— ” “ Dear Walter ! go we</l>
       <l n="274">Farther in Litwa ; hide we from the Germans</l>
       <l n="275">In mountains and in forests . ” “ Aye , we go ,</l>
       <l n="276">And other mothers , children leave behind .</l>
       <l n="277">Thus fled the Prussians ; Germans overtook them</l>
       <l n="278">In Litwa . If they trace us in the mountains —— ”</l>
       <l n="279">“ Let us again go farther . ” “ Farther ? farther ?</l>
       <l n="280">Unhappy one ! shall we go far from Litwa ,</l>
       <l n="281">Into the Tartar 's or the Rusin 's hands ? ”</l>
       <l n="282">Hushed was Aldona , troubled at this answer ,</l>
       <l n="283">For hitherto it had to her appeared</l>
       <l n="284">Her Fatherland were long as is the world ,</l>
       <l n="285">Wide without end ; and now for the first time</l>
       <l n="286">She heard there was no refuge in all Litwa .</l>
       <l n="287">Wringing her hands she asked , “ What may be done ? ”</l>

       <l n="308">The Germans harrying or by them attacked ,</l>

       <l n="319">But in the German tongue held he discourse</l>

       <l n="326">He fell before Aldona 's feet and pressed</l>
       <l n="327">Her hands unto his heart , and pardon begged</l>
       <l n="328">For all the things that she had suffered of him .</l>
       <l n="329">“ Woe ! ” cried he , “ unto women loving madmen ,</l>
       <l n="330">Whose hearts domestic happiness contents not .</l>
       <l n="331">Great hearts , Aldona , are like hives too large ;</l>
       <l n="332">Honey can fill them not , and they become</l>
       <l n="333">The lizard 's nest . Forgive me , dear Aldona !</l>
       <l n="334">To-day I would remain at home , to-day</l>

       <l n="338">She thought , unhappy , Walter would be changed ,</l>

       <l n="343">Spent Walter . Litwa , Teutons , and the war</l>
       <l n="344">He cast awhile into forgetfulness ;</l>
       <l n="345">Talked of those happy times when first he came</l>
       <l n="346">To Litwa , his first converse with Aldona ,</l>
       <l n="347">The first walk to the valley , and of all</l>
       <l n="348">Those childish things , but memorable to the heart ,</l>
       <l n="349">Of that first love . Wherefore such sweet discourse</l>
       <l n="350">Must he break off with that sad word — to-morrow ,</l>
       <l n="351">And plunge in thought , look long upon his wife ?</l>

       <l n="358">‘ Tis vain to ask . Aldona looks and waits ,</l>

       <l n="366">A lover 's eyes are vigilant . Aldona</l>
       <l n="367">Had guessed their flight ; she rushed into the valley .</l>

       <l n="405">Thus falls upon an unknown vessel 's mast .</l>
       <l n="406">And Walter understood Aldona . Silent</l>
       <l n="407">He followed her , and told her his design ,</l>
       <l n="408">Commanding secrecy before the world .</l>
       <l n="409">And at the doors — ah ! fearful was that parting !</l>
       <l n="410">Alf rode off with the Wajdelote . Till now</l>

       <l n="195">Twelve swords were raised aloft ; one aim was theirs —</l>
       <l n="196">Destined to Konrad 's heart . Then all departed</l>
       <l n="197">In gloomy silence , and the walls behind ,</l>

       <l n="42">Oh ! seeing these , a blessing all unknown ,</l>
       <l n="43">Foreshadowing of joy , revived my heart ;</l>

       <l n="54">And thee , O my beloved , to our valley ,</l>
       <l n="55">There will I lead thee , raise thee with my hand .</l>
       <l n="56">Or go we further still ? Litwa has deserts ;</l>
       <l n="57">There lie deep shades in woods of Bialowiez ,</l>
       <l n="58">Where never rings the clang of foreign swords ,</l>
       <l n="59">Nor sounds the haughty victor 's signal-word —</l>
       <l n="60">No , nor the groanings of our vanquished brothers .</l>

    <head>NOTES .</head>
    <p n="1">( 1 ) “ In towers of Marienbourg the bells are ringing . ”</p>
    <p n="2">Marienbourg , in Polish Malborg , a fortified town , formerly the capital of the Teutonic Order , under Kazimir Jagellon ( 1444-1492 ) united to the Polish Republic ; later on , given as a pledge to the Margraves of Brandenburgh . It came at last into the possession of the Kings of Prussia . In the vaults of the castle were the graves of the Grand-Masters , some of which are still preserved .</p>
    <p n="3">( 2 ) “ But foreign houses of his fame were full . ”</p>
    <p n="4">Houses — so were called the convents , or rather castles , scattered through various parts of Europe .</p>
    <p n="5">( 3 ) “ The strife of keen-edged swords ” = combattre a outrance .</p>
    <p n="6">( 4 ) The Archkomtur .</p>
    <p n="7">The Grosskomthur was the chief officer after the Grand-Master .</p>
    <p n="8">( 5 ) “ Some unknown pious woman from afar . ”</p>
    <p n="9">The chronicles of that time speak of a country girl , who , having come to Marienbourg , asked to be walled up in a solitary cell , and there ended her life . Her grave was famous for miracles .</p>
    <p n="10">( 6 ) “ Our master he . ”</p>
    <p n="11">In time of election , if opinions were divided or uncertain , similar occurrences were often taken as omens , and influenced the decisions of the chapter . Thus Winrych Kniprode gained all the voices , because some of the brothers heard , as though from the tombs of the Grand-Masters , a three-fold calling : “ Vinrice , ordo laborat . ”</p>
    <p n="12">( 7 ) “ A fire eternal burns in Swentorog 's halls . ”</p>
    <p n="13">The castle of Wilna , where formerly was maintained the Znicz ; that is , an ever-burning fire .</p>
    <p n="14">( 8 ) “ The place was Witold 's . ”</p>
    <p n="15">[ Witold , the son of Kiejstut , after rising over the heads of the other Lithuanian princes to the sovereignty of the whole country , was ultimately dispossessed by his cousin Jagellon , founder of the Jagellon dynasty , which reigned over Poland and Lithuania from 1386 to 1572 . ]</p>
    <p n="16">( 9 ) Song of the Wajdelote .</p>
    <p n="17">The Wajdelotes , Sigonoci , Lingustoni were priests whose office was to relate or sing to the people the acts of their forefathers at all festivals . That the old Lithuanians and Prussians loved and cultivated poetry is proved by the enormous number of ancient songs , still remaining among the common people , and by the testimony of chroniclers . We read that during a grand festival on the occasion of the election of the Grand-Master Winrych von Kniprode , a German Minnesinger , being honoured with applause and a gold cup , a Prussian named Rizelus , was so encouraged by this good reception of a poet , that he entreated for permission to sing in his native Lithuanian tongue , and celebrated the deeds of the first king of the Litwini , Wajdewut . The Grand-Master and the knights , not understanding and disliking the Lithuanian speech , ridiculed the poet , and gave him a present of a plate of empty nutshells . In Prussia the Crusaders forbade officials and all who approached the court to use the Lithuanian tongue , under penalty of death ; they banished from the country , together with the Jews and gipsies , the Wajdelotes , or Lithuanian bards , who alone knew and could relate the national annals . Again in Lithuania , after the introduction of the Christian faith and the Polish language , the ancient priests and the native speech fell into disrepute , and were forgotten ; thence the common people , changed to serfs , and attached to the soil , having abandoned the sword , also forgot those chivalric songs . Still something has remained of their ancient annals and heroic verse , long joined with superstition , communicated in secret to the people . Simon Grunau , in the sixteenth century , came by accident on the Prussians at a solemnity , and with difficulty saved his life , on promising the peasants , that he never would reveal to any one what he should see or hear ; then , after performing sacrifice , an old Wajdelote began to sing the deeds of the ancient Lithuanian heroes , mingling therewith prayers and moral instructions . Grunau , who well understood Lithuanian , confesses that he never expected to hear anything similar from the lips of a Lithuanian , such was the beauty of the theme and the phraseology .</p>
    <p n="18">( 10 ) “ Stands visibly the pestilential maid . ”</p>
    <p n="19">The common people in Lithuania figure pestilential air under the form of a maiden , whose appearance , here described according to the popular song , precedes a terrible sickness . I quote , in substance at least , a ballad I once heard in Lithuania : — “ In a village appeared the maiden of the pestilence ; and , after her custom , thrusting her hand through door or window , and waving a red cloth , scattered death through the houses . The inhabitants shut themselves up in a state of siege , but hunger and other necessities soon obliged them to neglect such means of safety ; all therefore awaited death . A certain gentleman , although well provided with victuals , and able to maintain a long while this strange siege , yet resolved to sacrifice himself for the good of his neighbours , took a sabre of the time of the Sigismonds , on which was the name of Jesus and the name of Mary , and thus armed , opened the window of the house . The gentleman , with one stroke , cut off the spectre 's hand , and got possession of the handkerchief . It is true he died , and all his family died ; but from that time the disease was never known in the village . ” This handkerchief was said to be preserved in the church , I do not recollect of what village . In the East , before the appearance of the plague , a phantom with bats ’ wings is said to appear , and to point with its fingers at those condemned to die . It appears as though popular imagination wished to present , by such images , that mysterious foreboding and strange anxiety which usually precedes great misfortune or destruction , and which often is shared , not by individuals only , but by whole nations . Thus in Greece were forebodings of the long duration and terrible results of the Peloponnesian war ; in the Roman Empire of the fall of monarchy ; in America of the coming of the Spaniards .</p>
    <p n="20">( 11 ) “ The trees of Bialowiez . ”</p>
    <p n="21">[ The trees here referred to are of an immense age and extra-ordinary height , challenging comparison with the giant trees of California . Many of them were venerated as divinities by the pagans of Lithuania , in whose religion tree and serpent worship formed a prominent feature . Oracles were supposed to be given from a peculiar species of oak , called Baublis , ever green both summer and winter . In the trunk of one of these , cut down about the year 1845 , there were counted 1417 rings . ]</p>
    <p n="22">( 12 ) “ Do burn the German knights in sacrifice . ”</p>
    <p n="23">The Lithuanians used to burn prisoners of war , especially Germans , as offerings to the gods . For this purpose was set aside the leader , or the most distinguished of the knights for high descent and bravery ; if several had become prisoners , the unfortunate victim was chosen by lot . For example , after the victory of the Lithuanians over the Crusaders , in the year 1315 , Stryjkowski says : “ And Litwa and Zmudz ( Samogitia ) after this victory , and after taking abundant spoil from their conquered and thunder-stricken foes , when they had paid to their gods sacrifices and the accustomed prayers , burnt alive a distinguished Crusader of the name of Gerard Rudde , the chief of the prisoners , with the horse on which he made war , and with the armour which he had worn , on a lofty pile of wood ; and with the smoke they sent his soul to heaven , and scattered his body to the winds with the ashes . ”</p>
    <p n="24">( 13 ) “ They gave me the name of Walter . ”</p>
    <p n="25">Walter von Stadion , a German knight , taken prisoner by the Lithuanians , married the daughter of Kiejstut , and with her secretly departed from Lithuania . It frequently occurred that Prussians and Lithuanians , carried off as children , and educated in Germany , returned to their country , and became the bitterest foes of the Germans . Thus the Prussian Herkus Monte was remarkable in the annals of the Order .</p>
    <p n="26">( 14 ) War .</p>
    <p n="27">The picture of this war is drawn from history . [ The circumstances of Napoleon 's retreat from Moscow , no doubt largely furnished the painful and realistic details in the text . ]</p>
    <p n="28">( 15 ) “ The secret tribunal descends to council . ”</p>
    <p n="29">In the Middle Ages , when powerful dukes and barons frequently permitted themselves great crimes , when the power of ordinary tribunals was too weak to humble them , secret brotherhoods were formed , whose members , unknown to one another , bound themselves by oath to punish the guilty , not pardoning even their own friends or relatives . As soon as the secret judges had pronounced the decree of death , the condemned man was made aware of it , by a voice calling under his windows , or somewhere in his presence , the word — Weh ! ( woe ! ) This word , three times repeated , was a warning that he who heard it should prepare for death , which he must infallibly and unexpectedly receive from an unknown hand . The secret court was called the fehm tribunal ( Vehmgericht ) or Westphalian . It is difficult to determine its origin ; according to some writers it was instituted by Charlemagne . At first necessary , it gave opportunity for many abuses later on , and governments were forced to exercise severity occasionally against the judges themselves , before this institution was completely overthrown . [ Scott 's graphic description in “ Anne of Geierstein ” of the court and procedure of the Vehmgericht will be instantly suggested . ]</p>
    <p n="30">( 16 ) “ A sudden cry . ”</p>
    <p n="31">— “ What cleaves the silent air , So madly shrill , so passing wild ? It was a woman 's shriek , and ne'er In madlier ascents rose despair ; And they who heard it as it passed , In mercy wished it were the last . ” — PARISINA .</p>
    <p n="32">[ The coincidence , or borrowing of ideas , is manifest , but the image has been amplified and beautified in the Polish poem . ]</p>
