    <docDate><date>1816</date>TO LADY BEDINGFELD . To whom ,— as Fancy , taking longer flight , With folded arms upon her heart 's high swell , Floating the while in circles of delight , And whispering to her wings a sweeter spell Than she has ever aim 'd or dar 'd before — Shall I address this theme of minstrel lore ? To whom but her who loves herself to roam Through tales of earlier times , and is at home With heroes and fair dames , forgotten long , But for romance , and lay , and lingering song ? To whom but her , whom , ere my judgment knew , Save but by intuition , false from true , Seem 'd to me wisdom , goodness , grace combin 'd ; The ardent heart ; the lively , active mind ? To whom but her whose friendship grows more dear , And more assur 'd , for every lapsing year ? One whom my inmost thought can worthy deem Of love , and admiration , and esteem !</docDate>

    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">As there is little , in all I have been able to collect respecting MARIE , which has any thing to do with the Poem , I have chosen to place such information at the end of the book , in form of an Appendix , rather than here ; where the only things necessary to state are , that she was an Anglo-Norman Minstrel of the thirteenth century ; and as she lived at the time of our losing Normandy , I have connected her history with that event : that the young king who sees her in his progress through his foreign possessions is our Henry III . ; and the Earl William who steps forward to speak in her favour is William Longsword , brother to Richard Coeur de Lion . Perhaps there is no record of minstrels being called upon to sing at a feast in celebration of a victory which involves their own greatest possible misfortune ; but such an incident is not of improbable occurrence . It is likely , also , that a woman , said to be more learned , accomplished , and pleasing , than was usually the case with those of her profession , might have a father , who , with the ardour , the disobedience , the remorse of his heroic master , had been , like him , a crusader and a captive ; and in the after solitude of self-inflicted penitence , full of romantic and mournful recollections , fostered in the mind of his daughter , by nature embued with a portion of his own impassioned feelings , every tendency to that wild and poetical turn of thought which qualified her for a minstrel ; and , after his death , induced her to become one .</p>
    <p n="2">The union of European and Eastern beauty , in the person of Marie , I have attempted to describe as lovely as possible . The consciousness of noble birth , of injurious depression , and the result of that education which absorbed the whole glowing mind of a highly gifted parent , a mind rich with adventures , with enthusiasm and tenderness , ought to be pourtrayed in her deportment ; while the elegance and delicacy which more particularly distinguish the gentlewoman , would naturally be imbibed from a constant early association with a model of what the chivalrous spirit of the age could form , with all its perfections and its faults ; in a situation , too , calculated still more to refine such a character ; especially with one who was the centre of his affections and regrets , and whom he was so soon to leave unprotected . That , possessing all these advantages , notwithstanding her low station , she should be beloved by , and , on the discovery of her birth , married to a young nobleman , whose high favour with his sovereign would lead him to hope such an offence against the then royal prerogative of directing choice would be deemed a venial one , is , I should think , an admissible supposition .</p>
    <p n="3">That a woman would not be able to sing under such afflicting circumstances might be objected ; but history shews us , scarcely any exertion of fortitude or despair is too great to be looked for in that total deprivation of all worldly interest consequent to such misfortunes . Whether that train of melancholy ideas which her own fate suggests is sufficiently removed from narration to be natural , or not near it enough to be clear , the judgment of others must determine . No wish or determination to have it one way or another , in sentiment , stile , or story , influenced its composition ; though , occasionally , lines previously written are interwoven ; and , in one instance , a few that have been published .</p>
    <p n="4">Her Twelve Lays are added in a second Appendix , as curious in themselves , and illustrative of the manners and morals of an age when they formed the amusement of the better orders .</p>

    <docTitle><titlePart>THE LAY OF MARIE . CANTO FIRST . The guests are met , the feast is near , But Marie does not yet appear ! And to her vacant seat on high Is lifted many an anxious eye . The splendid show , the sumptuous board , The long details which feuds afford , And discontent is prone to hold , Absorb the factious and the cold ;— Absorb dull minds , who , in despair , The standard grasp of worldly care , Which none can quit who once adore — They love , confide , and hope no more ; Seek not for truth , nor e'er aspire To nurse that immaterial fire , From whose most healthful warmth proceed Each real joy and generous deed ; Which , once extinct , no toil or pain Can kindle into life again , To light the then unvarying eye , To melt , in question or reply , Those tones , so subtil and so sweet , That none can look for , none repeat ; Which , self-impell 'd , defy controul ,— They bear the signet of the soul ; And , as attendants of their flight , Enforce persuasion and delight . Words that an instant have reclin 'd Upon the pillow of the mind , Or caught , upon their rapid way , The beams of intellectual day , Pour fresh upon the thirsty ear , O'erjoy ' d , and all awake to hear , Proof that in other hearts is known The secret language of our own . They to the way-worn pilgrim bring A draught from Rapture 's sparkling spring ; And , ever welcome , are , when given , Like some few scatter 'd flowers from heaven ; Could such in earthly garlands twine , To bloom by others less divine . Where does this idle Minstrel stay ? Proud are the guests , august the day ; And princes of the realm attend The triumph of their sovereign 's friend ;— Triumph of stratagem and fight Gain 'd o'er a young and gallant knight , Who , the last fort compell 'd to yield , Perish 'd , despairing , in the field . The Norman Chief , whose sudden blow Had laid fair England 's banner low ; Spite of resistance firm and bold Secur 'd the latest , surest hold Its sceptre touch 'd across the main , Important , difficult to gain , Easy against her to retain ;— Baron de Brehan — seem 'd to stand An alien in his native land ; One whom no social ties endear 'd Except his child ; and she appear 'd Unconsciously to prompt his toil ,— Unconsciously to take the spoil Of hate and treason ; and , ‘ twas said , The pillage of a kinsman dead , Whom , for his large domain , he slew : ‘ Twas whisper 'd only ,— no one knew . At tale of murderous deed , his ear No startling summons seem 'd to hear ; Yet should some sudden theme intrude Of friend betray 'd — ingratitude ;— Or treacherous counsel — follies nurs 'd In ardent minds , who , dying , curs 'd The guileful author of their woes ; His troubled look would then disclose Some secret anguish , inward care , Which mutely , sternly , said , Forbear ! He spake of policy and right , Of bold exploits in recent fight ,— Of interest , and the common weal , Of distant empire , slow appeal . Skill 'd to elicit thoughts unknown In other minds , and hide his own , His brighter eye , in darting round Their purposes and wishes found . Praises , and smiles , and promise play 'd Around his speech ; which yet convey 'd No meaning , when , the moment past , Memory retold her stores at last . Courtiers were there , the old and young , Of high and haughty lineage sprung ; And jewell 'd matrons : some had been , Erewhile , spectators of a scene Like this , with mien and manners gay ; Who now , their hearts consum 'd away , Held all the pageant in disdain , And seem 'd to smile and speak with pain . Of such were widows , who deplor 'd Husbands long lost , but still ador 'd ; To grace their children , fierce and proud , Like martyrs led into the crowd : Mothers , their sole remaining stay , In some dear son , late snatch 'd away ; Whose duty made them better brook Their lords ’ high tone and careless look ; Whose praises had awaken 'd pride In bosoms dead to all beside . Warriors , infirm with battles grown , Were there , in languid grandeur thrown On the low bench , who seem 'd to say , “ Our mortal vigour wanes away ; ” And gentle maid , with aspect meek , While cloud-like blushes cross her cheek , Restless awaits the Minstrel 's power To dispossess the present hour , And by a spirit-seizing charm , Her thoughts employ , her fancy warm , And snatch her from the mute distress Of conscious , breathless bashfulness . Young knights , who never tamely wait , Crowd in the porch , or near the gate , By quick return , and sudden throng , Announcing the expected song . The Minstrel comes , and , by command , Before the nobles of the land , In her poor order 's simple dress , Grac 'd only by the native tress , A flowing mass of yellow 'd light , Whose bold swells gleam with silver bright , And dove-like shadows sink from sight . Those long , soft locks , in many a wave Curv 'd with each turn her figure gave ; Thick , or if threatening to divide , They still by sunny meshes hide ; Eluding , by commingling lines , Whatever severs or defines . Amid the crowd of beauties there , None were so exquisitely fair ; And , with the tender , mellow 'd air , The taper , flexile , polish 'd limb , The form so perfect , yet so slim , And movement , only thought to grace The dark and yielding Eastern race ; As if on pure and brilliant day Repose , as soft as moonlight , lay . Reluctant still she seem 'd ,— her feet Sought slowly the appointed seat : Her hand , oft lifting to her head , She lightly o'er her forehead spread ; Then the unconscious motion check 'd , And , struggling with her own neglect , Seem 'd as she but by effort found The presence of an audience round . Meanwhile the murmurings died away Which spake impatience of delay : A pitying wonder , new and kind , Arose in each beholder 's mind : They saw no scorn to meet reproof , No arrogance to keep aloof ; Her air absorb 'd , her sadden 'd mien , Combin 'd the mourning , captive queen , With her who at the altar stands To raise aloft her spotless hands , In meek and persevering prayer , For such as falter in despair . All that was smiling , bright , and gay , Youth 's show of triumph during May , Its roseate crown , was snatch 'd away ! Yet sorrows , which had come so soon , Like tender morning dew repos 'd , O'er hope and joy as softly clos 'd As moist clouds on the light at noon . Opprest by some heart-withering pang , Upon her harp she seem 'd to hang Awhile o'erpower ' d — then faintly sang : “ Demand no lay of long-past times ; Of foreign loves , or foreign crimes ; Demand no visions which arise To Rapture 's eager , tearless eyes ! Those who can travel far , I ween , Whose strength can reach a distant scene , And measure o'er large space of ground , Have not , like me , a deadly wound ! Near home , perforce , alas , I stray , Perforce pursue my destin 'd way , Through scenes where all my trouble grows , And where alone remembrance flows . Like evening swallows , still my wings Float round in low , perpetual rings ; But never fold the plume for rest One moment in the tranquil nest ; And have no strength to reach the skies , No power , no hope , no wish to rise ! “ Blame me not , Fancy , if I now restrain Thy wandering footsteps , now thy wings confine ; Tis the decree of Fate ,— it is not mine ! For I would let thee free and widely stray — Would follow gladly , tend thee on thy way , And never of the devious track complain , Never thy wild and sportive flights disdain ! Though reasonless those graceful moods may be , They still , alas ! were passing sweet to me . “ Unhappy that I am , compell 'd to bind This murmuring captive ! one who ever strove By each endearing art to win my love ; Who , ever unoffending , ever bright , Danc 'd in my view , and pleas 'd me to delight ! She scatter 'd showers of lilies on my mind ; For , oh ! so fair , so fresh , and so refin 'd , Her child-like offerings , without thorns to pain , Without one canker 'd wound , or earthly stain . “ And , darling ! as my trembling fingers twine Those fetters round thee , they are wet with tears ! For the sweet playmate of my early years I cannot thus afflict , nor thus resign My equal liberty , and not repine ! For I had made thee , infant as thou art , Queen of my hopes , my leisure , and my heart ; Given thee its happiest laugh , its sweetest tear , And all I found or conquer 'd every year . “ I blame me now I let thy sports offend Old Time , and laid thy snare within his path To make him falter , as it often hath ; For he grew angry soon , and held his breath , And hurried on , in frightful league with Death , To make the way through which my footsteps bend , Late rich in all that social scenes attend , A desert ; and with thee I droop , I die , Beneath the look of his malignant eye . “ Me do triumphant heroes call To grace with harp their festal hall ? O ! must my voice awake the song ?— My skill the artful tale prolong ? Yes ! I am call 'd — it is my doom ! Unhappily , ye know not whom , Nor what , impatient ye demand ! How hostile now the fever 'd hand , Across these chords unwilling thrown , To echo plainings of my own ! Little indeed can ye divine What song ye ask who call for mine ! “ Till now , before the courtly crowd I humbly and I gaily bow 'd ; The blush was not to shame allied Which on my glowing cheek I wore ; No lowly seemings pain 'd nay pride , My heart was laughing at the core ; And sometimes , as the stream of song Bore me with eddying haste along , My father 's spirit would arise , And speak strange meaning from these eyes , At which a conscious cheek would quail , A stern and lofty bearing fail : Then could a chieftain condescend In me to recognize his friend ! Then could a warrior low incline His eye , when it encounter 'd mine ! A tone can make the guilty start ! A glance can pierce the conscious heart , Encountering memory in its flight , Most waywardly ! Such wounds are slight ; But I withdraw the painful light ! “ Fair lords and princes ! many a time For you I wove my pictur 'd rhyme ; Refin 'd new thoughts and fancies crude In deep and careful solitude ; ‘ And , when my task was finish 'd , came To seek the meed of praise or blame ; While , even then , untir 'd I strove To serve beneath the yoke of love . Whene'er I mark 'd a fearful look , When pride , or when resentment , spoke , I bent the tenor of my strain , And trembled lest it were in vain . By many an undiscover 'd wile I brought the pallid lip to smile , Clear 'd the maz 'd thought for ampler scope , Sustain 'd the flagging wings of hope ; And threw a mantle over care Such as the blooming Graces wear ! I made the friend resist his pride , Scarce aiming what he felt to hide From other eyes , his own implor 'd That kindness were again restor 'd . As generous themes engag 'd my tongue In pleadings for the fond and young : Towards his child the father leant , In fast-subsiding discontent : I made that father 's claims be felt , And saw the rash , the stubborn , melt ; Nay , once , subdued , a rebel knelt . “ Thus skill 'd , from pity 's warm excess , The aching spirit to caress ; Profuse of her ideal wealth , And rich in happiness and health , An alien , class 'd among the poor , Unheeded , from her precious store , Its best and dearest tribute brought ; The zeal of high , adventurous thought , The tender awe in yielding aid , E'en of its own soft hand afraid ! Stealing , through shadows , forth to bless , Her venturous service knew no bound ; Yet shrank , and trembled , when success Its earnest , fullest wishes crown 'd ! This alien sinks , opprest with woe , And have you nothing to bestow ? No language kind , to sooth or cheer ?— No soften 'd voice ,— no tender tear ?— No promise which may hope impart ? No fancy to beguile the heart ; To chace those dreary thoughts away , And waken from this deep dismay ! “ Is it that station , power , or pride , Can human sympathies divide ? Or is she deem 'd a thing of art , Form 'd only to enact a part , Whose nice perceptions all belong To modulated thought and song , And , in fictitious feeling thrown , Lie waste or callous in her own ? “ Is it from poverty of soul ; Or does some fear some doubt , controul ? So round the heart strong fibres strain , That it attempts to beat in vain ? Does palsy on your feelings hang , Deaden 'd by some severer pang ? If so , behold , my eyes o'erflow ! For , O ! that anguish well I know ! When once that fatal stroke is given ,— When once that finest nerve is riven , Our love , our pity , all are o'er ; We even sooth ourselves no more ! “ Back , hurrying feelings ! to the time I learnt to clothe my thoughts in rhyme ! When , climbing up my father 's knees , I gaily sang , secure to please ! Rounded his pale and wasted cheek , And won him , in his turn , to speak : When , for reward , I closer prest , And whisper 'd much , and much carest ; With timorous eye , and head aside , Half ask 'd , and laugh 'd , and then denied ; Ere I again petition made To hear the often-told crusade . How , knowing hardship but by name , Misled by friendship and by fame , His parents ’ wishes he disdain 'd , With zeal , nor real quite , nor feign 'd ; And fought on many a famous spot ;— The suffering of a captive 's lot ; My Georgian mother 's daring flight ; The day 's concealment , march by night ; Her death , when , touching Christian ground , They deem 'd repose and safety found : How , on his arm , by night and day , I , then a happy infant , lay , And taught him not to mourn , but pray . How , when , at length , he reach 'd his home , His heart foretold a gentle doom ; With tears of fondness in his eyes , Hoping to cause a glad surprize ; Full of submission , pondering o'er What he too lightly priz 'd before ; The curse with tenfold vengeance fell .— Those who had lov 'd him once so well , In whose indulgence perfect trust Had still been wise , though most unjust , Were in the grave !— Their hearts were cold ! His penitence might still be told — Told to the winds ! for few would hear , Or , hearing , deem that tale sincere His patrimony 's lord denied , Who , hardening in possession 's pride , Affirm 'd the rightful owner died . “ A victim from devouring strife , And slavery , return 'd with life ; Possessions , honours , parents gone , The very hand that urg 'd him on , Now , by its stern repelling , tore The veil that former falsehood wore ! “ When he first bar 'd his heart before thy view , Told all its inmost beatings — told them true ; Nay , e'en the pulse , the secret , trembling thrill , On which the slightest touch alone would trill [ Errata : kill ] ; While thou , with secret aim , collected art , Didst wind around that bold , confiding heart , And , in its warm and healthful breathings fling A subtle poison , and a deadly sting ! “ Where shall we else so fell a traitor find ? The wilful , hard misleader of the blind And what can be the soul-perverter 's meed , Plotting to lure his friend to such a deed , As made self-hatred on the conscience lay That heavy weight she never moves away ? O ! where the good man 's inner barriers close ‘ Gainst the world 's cruel judgments , and his foes Enfolding truth , and prayer , and soul 's repose , Thine is a mournful numbness , or a din , For many strong accusers lurk within ! “ And , since this fatal period , in thine eyes A shrewd and unrelaxing witness lies ; While , on the specious language of the tongue , Deceit has hateful , warning accents hung ; And outrag 'd nature , struggling with a smile , Announces nought but discontent and guile ; Each trace of fair , auspicious meaning flown , All that makes man by man belov 'd and known . Silence , indignant thought ! forego thy sway ! Silence ! and let me measure on my way ! “ Soul-struck , and yielding to his fate , My father left his castle gate . ‘ Thou , ’ he would cry , with flowing eyes , ‘ That moment wert the sacrifice ! Little , alas ! avails to thee Wealth , honours , titles , ancestry ; All lost by me ! I dar 'd to lift On high thy welfare , as a gift ! To save thee , dearest , dar 'd resign Thy worldly good ! it was not mine ! But , O ! I felt around thee twin 'd My very self ,— my heart and mind ! All that may chance is dead to me , Save only as it touches thee ! Could self-infliction but atone For one who lives in thee alone ; If my repentance and my tears Could spare thy future smiling years , The fatal curse should only rest Upon this firm , though guilty breast ? Yet , tendering from thy vessel 's freight Offerings of such exceeding weight , And free thee from one earthly chain ! Envy and over-weening hate Would on thy orphan greatness wait ; Folly that supple nature bend For parasites to scorn thy friend ; And pamper 'd vanity incline To wilful blindness such as mine ! “ ‘ Thee to the altar yet I bring ! Hear me , my Saviour and my King ! Again I for my child resign All worldly good ! but make her thine ! Let her soft footsteps gently move , Nor waken grief , nor injure love ; Carelessly trampling on the ground That priceless gem , so rarely found ; That treasure , which , should angels guard , Would all their vigilance reward ! “ ‘ My mind refuses still to fear She should be cold or insincere ; That aught like meanness should debase One of our rash and wayward race , No ! most I dread intemperate pride , Deaf ardour , reckless , and untried , With firm controul and skilful rein , Its hurrying fever to restrain ! “ ‘ Others might wish their soul 's delight Should be most lovely to the sight ; And beauty vainly I ador 'd , Serv 'd with my eye , my tongue , my sword ; Nay , let me not from truth depart ! Enshrin 'd and worship 'd it at heart . Oft , when her mother fix 'd my gaze , Enwrapt , on bright perfection 's blaze , Hopes the imperious spell beguil 'd , Transcendant thus to see my child : But now , for charms of form or face , Save only purity and grace ; Save sweetness , which all rage disarms , Would lure an infant to her arms In instantaneous love ; and make A heart , like mine , with fondness ache ; I little care , so she be free From such remorse as preys on me ! ’ “ My dearest father !— Yet he grew Profoundly anxious , as he knew More of the dangers lurking round ; But I was on enchanted ground ! Delighted with my minstrel art , I had a thousand lays by heart ; And while my yet unpractis 'd tongue Descanted on the strains I sung , Still seeking treasure , like a bee , I laugh 'd and caroll 'd , wild with glee ! “ Delicious moments then I knew , When the rough winds against me blew : When , from the top of mountain steep , I glanc 'd my eye along the deep ; Or , proud the keener air to breathe , Exulting saw the vale beneath . When , launch 'd in some lone boat , I sought A little kingdom for my thought , Within a river 's winding cove , Whose forests form a double grove , And , from the water 's silent flow , Appear more beautiful below ; While their large leaves the lilies lave , Or plash upon the shadow 'd wave ; While birds , with darken 'd pinions , fly Across that still intenser sky ; Fish , with cold plunge , with startling leap , Or arrow-flight across the deep ; And stilted insects , light-o-limb , Would dimple o'er the even brim ; If , with my hand , in play , I chose The cold , smooth current to oppose , As fine a spell my senses bound As vacant bosom ever found ! “ And when I took my proudest post , Near him on earth I valued most , ( No after-time could banish thence A father 's dear pre-eminence ,) And felt the kind , protecting charm , The clasp of a paternal arm ; Felt , as instinctively it prest , The sacred magnet of his breast , ‘ Gainst which I lean 'd , and seem 'd to grow , With that deep fondness none can know , Whom Providence does not assign A parent excellent as mine ! That faith beyond , above mistrust , That gratitude , so wholly just , Each several , crowding claim forgot , Whose source was light , without a blot ; No moment of unkindness shrouding , No speck of anger overclouding : An awful and a sweet controul , A rainbow arching o'er the soul ; A soothing , tender thrill , which clung Around the heart , while , all unstrung , The thought was still , and mute the tongue ! “ O ! in that morn of life is given To one so tun 'd , a sumptuous dower ! Joys , which have flown direct from heaven , And Graces , captive in her bower . “ Thoughts which can sail along the skies , Or poise upon the buoyant air ; And make a peasant 's soul arise A monarch 's mighty power to share . “ When all that we perceive below , By land or sea , by night or day , The past , the future , and the flow Of present times , their tribute pay . “ Each bird , from cleft , from brake , or bower , Bears her a blessing on its wings ; And every rich and precious flower Its fragrance on her spirit flings . “ There 's not a star that shines above But pours on her a partial ray ; Endearments , like maternal love , Her love to Nature 's self repay . “ Faith , Hope , and Joy about her heart , Close interlace the angel arm ; And with caresses heal the smart Of every care , and every harm . “ Amid the wealth , amid the blaze Of luxury and pomp around , How poor is all the eye surveys To what we know of fairy ground ! ” She ceases , and her tears flow fast — O ! can this fit of softness last , Which , so unlook 'd for , comes to share The sickly triumph of despair ? Upon the harp her head is thrown , All round is like a vision flown ; And o'er a billowy surge her mind Views lost delight left far behind . THE LAY OF MARIE .</titlePart></docTitle>

     <l n="1">The Lay of Marie .— Title .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The words roman , fabliau , and lai , are so often used indifferently by the old French writers , that it is difficult to lay down any positive rule for discriminating between them . But I believe the word roman particularly applies to such works as were to be supposed strictly historical : such are the romances of Arthur , Charlemagne , the Trojan War , &amp; c. The fabliaux were generally , stories supposed to have been invented for the purpose of illustrating some moral ; or real anecdotes , capable of being so applied . The lai , according to Le Grand , chiefly differed from the fabliau , in being interspersed with musical interludes ; but I suspect they were generally translations from the British . The word is said to be derived from leudus ; but laoi seems to be the general name of a class of Irish metrical compositions , as “ Laoi na Seilge ” and others , quoted by Mr. Walker ( Hist . Mem . of Irish Bards ) , and it may be doubted whether the word was not formerly common to the Welsh and American dialects .— Ellis 's Specimens .</p>

   <p>It is not to be supposed , what we now call metrical romances were always read . On the contrary , several of them bear internal evidence that they were occasionally chaunted to the harp . The Creseide of Chaucer , a long performance , is written expressly to be read , or else sung . It is evident that the minstrels could derive no advantage from these compositions , unless by reciting or singing them ; and later poems have been said to be composed to their tunes .— Notes to Sir Tristrem .</p>

   <p>The Anglo-Norman dynasty , with their martial nobility , down to the reign of Edward III . continued to use , almost exclusively , the Romance or ancient French language ; while the Saxon , although spoken chiefly by the vulgar , was gradually adopting , from the rival tongue , those improvements and changes , which fitted it for the use of Chaucer and Gower . In the introduction to the Metrical Romance of Arthur and Merlin , written during the minority of Edward V. it appears that the English language was then gaining ground .

Differing , perhaps , little in intrinsic value , but superior in beauty and permanence , and more consonant with the decorations of chivalry .

     <l n="1">Extracts from a Dissertation on the Life and Writings of Marie , an</l>
     <l n="2">Anglo-Norman Poetess of the thirteenth century . By Monsieur La Rue .</l>
     <l n="3">Archaelogia , vol . 13 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Mary must be regarded as the Sappho of her age ; she made so considerable a figure amongst the Anglo Norman Trouveurs , that she may very fairly lay claim to the minutest investigation of whatever concerns her memory . She informs us that she was born in France , but has neither mentioned the province that gave her birth , her family name , nor the reasons of her going to England . As she appears , however , to have resided in that country at the commencement of the 13th century , we may reasonably conclude that she was a native of Normandy . Philip Augustus having made himself master of that province in 1204 , many Norman families , whether from regard to affinity , from motive of adventure , or from attachment to the English government , went over to Great Britain , and there established themselves . If this opinion be not adopted , it will be impossible to fix upon any other province of France under the dominion of the English , as her birth-place , because her language is neither that of Gascony , nor of Poitou , &amp; c. She appears , however , to have been acquainted with the Bas-Breton , or Armoric tongue ; whence it may be inferred that she was born in Bretayne . The Duke of that province was then Earl of Richmond in England ; many of his subjects were in possession of knight 's fees in that honour , and Mary might have belonged to one of these families . She was , besides , extremely well versed in the literature of this province ; and we shall have occasion to remark , that she frequently borrowed much from the works of its writers in the composition of her own . If , however , a preference should be given to the first opinion , we must suppose that Mary got her knowledge , both of the Armoric and English languages , in Great Britain . She was , at the same time , equally mistress of the Latin ; and from her application to three several languages , we must take it for granted that she possessed a readiness , a capacity , and even a certain rank in life , that afforded time and means to attain them . It should seem that she was solicitous to be personally known only at the time she lived in . Hence we find in her works those general denominations , those vague expressions , which discourage the curious antiquary , or compel him to enter into dry and laborious discussions , the result of which , often turns out to be little more than conjecture . In short , the silence or the modesty of this lady , has contributed , in a great degree , to conceal from us the names of those illustrious persons whose patronage her talents obtained .</p>
   <p>The first poems of Mary are a collection of Lays , in French verse ; forming various histories and gallant adventures of our valiant knights : and , according to the usage of those times , they are generally remarkable for some singular , and often marvellous catastrophe . These Lays are in the British Museum , among the Harleian MSS . No . 978 . They constitute the largest , and , at the same time , most ancient specimen of Anglo-Norman poetry , of this kind , that has been handed down to us . The romances of chivalry , amongst the old Welsh and Armoric Britons , appear to have furnished the subjects of these various Lays ; not that the manuscripts of those people were continually before her when she composed them ; but , as she herself has told us , depending upon an excellent memory , she sometimes committed them to verse , after hearing them recited only : and , at others , composed her poems from what she had read in the Welsh and Armoric MSS .</p>

   <p>She confined herself to these subjects , and the event justifies her choice . To the singularity of such a measure was owing its celebrity . By treating of love and chivalry , she was certain of attuning her lyre to the feelings of the age ; and consequently of ensuring success . Upon this account her Lays were extremely well received by the people . Denis Pyramus , an Anglo-Norman poet , and the contemporary of Mary , informs us that they were heard with pleasure in all the castles of the English barons , but that they were particularly relished by the women of her time . He even praises them himself ; and this from the mouth of a rival , could not but have been sincere and well deserved , since our equals are always the best judges of our merit .<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>Insomuch as Mary was a foreigner , she expected to be criticised with severity , and therefore applied herself with great care to the due polishing of her works . Besides , she thought , as she says herself , that the chief reward of a poet , consists in perceiving the superiority of his own performance , and its claims to public esteem . Hence the repeated efforts to attain so honourable a distinction , and the constant apprehensions of that chagrin which results from disappointment , and which she has expressed with so much natural simplicity .</p>

   <p>But who is this monarch ? 1 . We may perceive in it her apprehension of the envy which her success might excite in a strange country : for this reason she could not have written in France . 2 . When at a loss for some single syllable , she sometimes intermixes in her verses words that are pure English , when the French word would not have suited the measure .— “ Fire et chaundelez alumez . ” It should seem , therefore , that she wrote for the English , since her lines contain words that essentially belong to their language , and not at all to the Romance . 3 . She dedicates her lays to a king who understood English , because she takes care to translate into that tongue all the Welsh and Armoric proper names that she was obliged to introduce . Thus in the Lay of Bisclaveret , she says , the English translate this name by that of Garwaf , ( Were-wolf ) ; in that of Laustic , that they call it Nihtgale ( Nightingale ) ; and in that of Chevrefeuille , Gotelef , ( Goatleaf ) &amp; c. It is certain , then , she composed for a king who understood English . 4 . She tells us that she had declined translating Latin histories into Romance ; because so many others having been thus occupied , her name would have been confounded with the multitude , and her labours unattended with honour . Now this circumstance perfectly corresponds with the reign of Henry III . when such a number of Normans and Anglo-Normans had , for more than half a century , translated from the Latin so many romances of chivalry ; and especially those of the Round Table , which we owe to the Kings of England . 5 . Fauchet and Pasquier inform us , that Mary lived about the middle of the 13th century , and this would exactly coincide with the reign of that prince .<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>6 . Denis Pyramu<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>, an Anglo-Norman poet , speaks of Mary as an author , whose person was as much beloved as her writings , and who therefore must have lived in his own time . Now it is known that this poet wrote under Henry III . and this opinion could only be confuted by maintaining that it was rather a King of France of whom she speaks , which king must have been Louis VIII . or St. Louis his son . But this alteration will not bear the slightest examination ; for how could it be necessary to explain Welsh and Armoric words to a French king in the English language ? How could the writer permit herself to make use of English words , in many parts of her work , which would most probably be unintelligible to that prince , and most certainly so to the greatest part of his subjects ? It is true that she sometimes explains them in Romance , but not always ; and when , upon the other hand , she makes a constant practice of translating them into English , she proves to what sort of readers she was principally addressing herself . The list of the lays of Mary is omitted here , as a translation follows .</p>
   <p>The smaller poems of Mary are , in general , of much importance , as to the knowledge of ancient chivalry . Their author has described manners with a pencil at once faithful and pleasing . She arrests the attention of her readers by the subjects of her stories , by the interest which she skilfully blends in them , and by the simple and natural language in which she relates them . In spite of her rapid and flowing style , nothing is forgotten in her details — nothing escapes her in her descriptions . With what grace has she depicted the charming deliverer of the unhappy Lanval ! Her beauty is equally impressive , engaging , and seductive ; an immense crowd follows but to admire her ; the while palfrey on which she rides seems proud of his fair burden ; the greyhound which follows her , and the falcon which she carries , announce her nobility . How splendid and commanding her appearance ; and with what accuracy is the costume of the age she lived in observed ! But Mary did not only possess a most refined taste , she had also to boast of a mind of sensibility . The English muse seems to have inspired her ; all her subjects are sad and melancholy ; she appears to have designed to melt the hearts of her readers , either by the unfortunate situation of her hero , or by some truly afflicting catastrophe . Thus she always speaks to the soul , calls forth all its feelings , and very frequently throws it into the utmost consternation .</p>
   <p>Fauchet was unacquainted with the Lays of Mary , for he only mentions her fables<span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span>. But , what is more astonishing , Monsieur le Grand , who published many of her lays , has not ascribed them all to her . He had probably never met with a complete collection like that in the British Museum ; but only some of those that had been separately transcribed ; and , in that case , he could not have seen the preface , in which Mary has named herself .</p>
   <p>The second work of our poetess consists of a collection of fables , generally called Aesopian , which she translated into French verse . In the prologue she informs her readers that she would not have engaged in it , but for the solicitation of a man who was “ the flower of chivalry and courtesy , ” and whom , at the conclusion of her work , she styles Earl William .</p>

   <p>M. le Grand , in his preface to some of Mary 's fables , which he has published in French prose , informs us that this person was Earl William de Dampierre . But William , Lord of Dampierre , in Champagne , had in himself no right whatever to the title of Earl . During the 13th century , this dignity was by no means assumed indiscriminately , and at pleasure , by French gentlemen ; it was generally borne by whoever was the owner of a province , and sometimes of a great city , constituting an earldom : such were the earldoms of Flanders , of Artois , of Anjou , of Paris , &amp; c. It was then , that these great vassals of the crown had a claim to the title of earl , and accordingly assumed it .<span type="note_anchor">[ 14 ]</span>Now , the territory of Dampierre was not in this predicament during the 13th century ; it was only a simple lordship belonging to the lords of that name .<span type="note_anchor">[ 15 ]</span></p>
   <p>Convinced , as I am , that Mary did not compose her fables in France , but in England , it is rather in England that the Earl William , alluded to by Mary , is to be sought for ; and luckily , the encomium she has left upon him is of such a nature , as to excite an opinion that he was William Longsword , natural son of Henry II . and created Earl of Salisbury and Romare by Richard Coeur de Lion . She calls him “ the flower of chivalry , the most valiant man in the kingdom , ” etc . ; and these features perfectly characterize William Longsword , so renowned for his prowess .<span type="note_anchor">[ 16 ]</span>The praise she bestows on him expresses , with great fidelity , the sentiments that were entertained by his contemporaries ; and which were become so general , that for the purpose of making his epitaph , it should seem that the simple eulogy of Mary would have sufficed .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>This earl died in 1226 ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 18 ]</span>so that Mary must have written her fables before that time . The brilliant reputation she had acquired by her lays , had no doubt determined William to solicit a similar translation of Aesopian Fables , which then existed in the English language . She , who in her lays had painted the manners of her age with so much nature and fidelity , would find no difficulty in succeeding in this kind of apologue . Both require that penetrating glance which can distinguish the different passions of mankind ; can seize upon the varied forms which they assume ; and marking the objects of their attention , discover , at the same moment , the means they employ to attain them . For this reason , her fables are written with all that acuteness of mind , that penetrates into the very inmost recesses of the human heart ; and , at the same time , with that beautiful simplicity so peculiar to the ancient romance language , and which causes me to doubt whether La Fontaine has not rather imitated our author , than the fabulists either of Rome , or of Athens . It most , at all events , be admitted that he could not find , in the two latter , the advantages which the former offered him . Mary wrote in French , and at a time when that language , yet in its infancy , could boast of nothing but simple expressions , artless and agreeable turns , and , on all occasions , a natural and unpremeditated phraseology .</p>
   <p>On the contrary , Aesop and Phaedrus , writing in Latin , could not supply the French fabulist with any thing more than subject matter and ideas ; whilst Mary , at the same time that she furnished him with both , might besides have hinted expression , manner , and even rhyme . Let me add , that through the works of La Fontaine will be found scattered an infinite number of words in our ancient language , which are at this day unintelligible without a commentary .</p>
   <p>There are , in the British Museum , three MS. copies of Mary 's fables . The first is in the Cotton library , Vesp . b. xiv . the second in the Harleian , No . 4333 ; and the third in the same collection , No . 978 . In the first , part of Mary 's prologue is wanting , and the transcriber has entirely suppressed the conclusion of her work . This MS. contains only sixty-one fables . The second has all the prologue , and the conclusion . It has 83 fables . The third is the completest of all , and contains 104 fables . M. le Grand says that he has seen four MSS . of these fables in the libraries of Paris , but all different as to the number . He cites one in the library of St. Germain des Prés , as containing 66 fables ; and another in the Royal Library , No . 7615 , with 102 .<span type="note_anchor">[ 19 ]</span>As he has said nothing about the other MSS . it is to be supposed that he has purposely mentioned that which had the greatest number of fables , and that which had the least . Under this idea , the Harleian MS. No . 978 , is the completest of all that have been yet cited .</p>
   <p>In examining the manner in which she speaks of herself , we shall perceive she does not call herself Marie de France , as he has stated , but says she is from France .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Al finement de cest escrit ,</l>
     <l n="2">Me nomerei par remembrance ,</l>
     <l n="3">Marie ai non si suis de France , &amp; c.<span type="note_anchor">[ 20 ]</span></l>
   </lg>
   <p>If we consider well the latter verse , there will be no difficulty in perceiving that Mary wrote in England . Indeed , it was formerly a very common thing for authors to say that they were of such a city , and even to assume the name of it . Or even , when writing in Latin , state themselves either natives of England , or of France . But when an author writes in France , and in the language of the country , he does not say that he is of France . Now this precaution , on the part of Mary , implies that she wrote in a foreign country , the greater part of whose inhabitants spoke her native language ; which was the case in England . She stated herself to be a native of France , that her works might be regarded as written in a purer and correcter style .</p>
   <p>Monsieur le Grand does not believe that Mary really translated from a collection that existed in her time in the English language , under the title of the Fables of Aesop ; but , if we examine the fables themselves , we shall discover in them internal evidence of their being translated from the English .</p>
   <p>Mention is made of counties and their judges , of the great assemblies held there for the administration of justice , the king 's writs , &amp; c. &amp; c. Now what other kingdom , besides England , was at that time divided into counties ? What other country possessed similar establishments ? But Mary has done more ; in her French translation she has preserved many expressions in the English original ; such as welke , in the fable of the Eagle , the Crow , and the Tortoise ; witecocs , in that of the Three Wishes ; grave , in that of the Sick Lion ; werbes and wibets , in that of the Battle of the Flies with other Animals ; worsel , in that of the Mouse and the Frog , &amp; c .</p>
   <p>The completest MS. of Mary 's translation , has but 104 fables ; out of which , 31 only are Aesop 's . So the English version that she had before her , was not a true and complete translation of that fabulist , but a compilation from different authors , in which some of his fables had been inserted . Nevertheless , Mary has intitled her work , “ Cy Commence li Aesope ; ” she repeats , also , that she had turned this fabulist into romance language . Mary , therefore , imagined that she was really translating Aesop ; but her original had the same title ; and I am the more convinced of this , because , in the Royal MS. before cited , which contains a collection of Aesopian fables , there are but 56 . According to the introduction , they had been already translated into Latin prose , and then into English prose ; and in this MS. as well as in Mary 's , there are many fables and fabliaux ascribed to Aesop , which never could have been composed by him .</p>
   <p>Again , if we compare the fables which generally pass for Aesop 's , with those written by Mary , we shall perceive that the translation of the latter could never have been regarded as a literal version of the former . She is a great deal more particular than Aesop ; her moralizations are not the same . In a word , I think she comes nearer to Phaedrus than to the Greek writer .</p>
   <p>It will , no doubt be answered , that the Works of Phaedrus have only been known since the end of the 16th century . This I admit ; but am not the less persuaded that Mary was better acquainted with Phaedrus than with Aesop . It will , moreover , be contended , that she has herself declared , that the English version , which served her as a model , was a translation from the Greek . To this I reply ; first , that Phaedrus 's fables may very properly be stiled Aesopian , as he has himself called them :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Aesopus auctor quam materiam reperit ,</l>
     <l n="2">Hanc ego polivi versibus senariis .<span type="note_anchor">[ 21 ]</span></l>
   </lg>
   <p>And , secondly , that although Mary possessed the fire , the imagination , and the genius of a poet , she nevertheless had not the criticism , or erudition , of a man of letters . For example ; she informs us , that before her fables were translated into English , they had already been turned from Greek into Latin by Aesop .<span type="note_anchor">[ 22 ]</span>She then gives the fable of an ox that assisted at mass , of a wolf that keeps Lent , of a monk disputing with a peasant , &amp; c .</p>
   <p>Amongst these compilers of fables , we find the names of Romulus , Accius , Bernardus , Talon , and many others anonymous . The first is the most celebrated ; he has addressed his fables to his son Tiberius ; they are written in Latin prose , sixty in number , and many of them are founded upon those of Aesop and Phaedrus . Rimilius published them at the end of the 15th century , and Frederic Nilant gave an edition in 1709 , at Leyden , with some curious and interesting notes . Fabricius , in his Bibliotheca Latina , says , that these sixty fables are more than five hundred years old .<span type="note_anchor">[ 23 ]</span>I have already mentioned that there is a MS. of them in the Royal Library in the British Museum , 15 A . VII ., which was written in the 13th century , and contains only fifty-six fables . They are said , in the preface , to have been translated out of Greek into Latin , by the Emperor Romulus . Mary likewise mentions this Romulus , and gives him the same title . After having remarked with how much advantage learned men might occupy themselves , in extracting from the works of the ancient philosophers , proverbs , fables , and the morals they contained , for the purpose of instructing men , and training them to virtuous actions , she adds , that the emperor had very successfully pursued the plan , in order to teach his son how to conduct himself with propriety through life<span type="note_anchor">[ 24 ]</span>.</p>
   <p>Vincent de Beauvois , a contemporary of Mary , speaks likewise of this Romulus and his fables<span type="note_anchor">[ 25 ]</span>; and lastly , Fabricius informs us that this author has very much imitated Phaedrus , and often preserved even his expressions .<span type="note_anchor">[ 26 ]</span>But , after all , it is uncertain who is this Romulus , thus invested with the title of emperor ; whether the last Roman emperor of that name , who is likewise called Augustulus or Romulus the grammarian . I should rather attribute them to some monk of the 11th or 12th century . The rites of the Roman Catholic worship are several times alluded to , and entire passages of the Vulgate very frequently inserted .</p>
   <p>It is , however , enough to know that in the time of Mary , there did actually exist a collection of fables called Aesopian , and published under the name of Romulus ; that this author , whether real or imaginary , had very much imitated Phaedrus ; that these Latin fables had been translated into English ; that , without doubt , those of some other unknown writers were added to them ; and , finally , that from this latter version Mary made her translation into French verse .</p>
   <p>In a MS. of the fables of Mary , it is said this English version was the work of King Mires .<span type="note_anchor">[ 27 ]</span>The Harleian MS. No . 978 , makes the translation to have been King Alurez . The MS. cited by Pasquier , calls him King Auvert .<span type="note_anchor">[ 28 ]</span>The MS. in the Royal Library , 15 A. VII . says the translation was made by the order of King Affrus ; and , lastly , the Harleian MS. No . 4333 , makes it the work of King Henry .</p>
   <p>With respect to King Alurez or Auvert , every one who has examined our ancient writers of romance , during the 12th and 13th centuries , must know that the name of Alfred was thus disfigured by them . Thus , two kings of England , Alfred and Henry , have a claim to that honour . But whence is it that the historian of Alfred , Asser , as well as William of Malmesbury , have mentioned the different translations of this prince , without having noticed that of Aesop ?<span type="note_anchor">[ 29 ]</span>Is it credible that an Anglo-Saxon version of the ninth century would have been intelligible to Mary , who had only learned the English of the thirteenth ? Had not the lapse of time , and the descents of the Danes and Normans in the eleventh century , contributed , in the first place , to alter the Anglo-Saxon ? and afterwards , during the twelfth , the rest of the people from the northern and western provinces of France , having become dependent upon England , did not they , likewise , by their commerce , and residence in that country , introduce a considerable change into its language ? The names of Seneschal , Justiciar , Viscount , Provost , Bailiff , Vassal , &amp; c. which occur in these fables , both in the Latin text and French translation by Mary , ought naturally to have been found in the English version . Now these several terms were all , according to Madox , introduced by the Normans ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 30 ]</span>and the morals to these fables , which make frequent allusion to the feudal system , prove more and more , that this English translation must have been posterior to the time of Alfred .</p>
   <p>In the last place , the Harleian MS. No . 4333 , ascribes the translation to King Henry . The Normans were acquainted with the fables of Aesop , or , at least , those which were attributed to him during the middle ages . The collateral heirs of Raoul de Vassy , who died in 1064 , when , after the death of William the Conqueror , they found means to establish their claims against Robert Courthose ; in asserting it , reproach his father with having made the lion 's partition in seizing Upon their inheritance .<span type="note_anchor">[ 31 ]</span></p>
   <p>This proverbial expression very clearly shews that the writings of the Greek fabulist , or at least of those who had followed him , were known to the Normans from the eleventh century . It is possible , therefore , that Henry I. might have studied and translated them into English . Again , all historians agree in giving this prince the title of Beauclerk , though no one has assigned any reason for a designation so honourable : and this opinion would justify history , which has given to Henry a name with which authors alone were dignified .</p>
   <p>Whether Mary followed the English version literally cannot be ascertained , as we do not even know whether it now exists ; and are therefore under the necessity of collating her fables with those of the middle ages : and it appears , she translated from the English 104 fables into French verse ; and of this number there are 65 , the subjects of which had already been treated of by Aesop , Phaedrus , Romulus , and the anonymous author of the Fabulae Antiquae , published by Niland .</p>
   <p>The English translation was not only compiled from these different authors , but from many other fabulists , whose names are unknown to us ; since , out of the 104 fables of Mary , there are 39 which are neither found in the before mentioned authors , nor in any other known to us .</p>
   <p>The English version contained a more ample assemblage of fables than that of Mary , since out of the 56 in the Royal MS. 15 A. VII , which made a part of the former , it appears that she made a selection of subjects that were pleasing to her , and rejected others . It is very singular , that England appears to have had fabulists during the ages of ignorance , whilst Athens and Rome possessed theirs only amidst the most refined periods of their literature .</p>
   <p>Some may , perhaps , be disposed to conclude that the 39 additional fables were actually composed by Mary ; but I believe , upon reflection , this opinion must be abandoned . She terms her work a translation , glories in the enterprize ; and , if it had been only in part the labours of her genius , would scarcely have passed over that circumstance in silence .</p>
   <p>Monsieur Le Grand has published 43 of Mary 's fables in prose . His translation , however , is not always literal ; and seems , in many places , to have departed from the original . He has likewise published many of the fabliaux , or little stories , which he has unadvisedly attributed to the transcribers of them , and which belong indisputably to her .</p>
   <p>I have examined La Fontaine , to ascertain whether he were acquainted with the fables of Mary , and had actually borrowed his subjects from the 39 fables which are wanting in all the writers of this kind with whom we are at present acquainted ; and have actually discovered , that he is indebted to them for those of the Drowning Woman , the Fox and the Cat , and the Fox and the Pigeon . From others he has only taken the subject , but changed the actors ; and , by retouching the whole in his peculiar manner , has enriched them with a new turn , and given them an appearance of originality .</p>
   <p>The third work of Mary consists of a history , or rather a tale , in French verse , of St. Patrick 's Purgatory . This performance was originally commenced in Latin , at the Abbey of Saltrey , and dedicated to the abbot of that monastery , and is to be found in MS. in many public libraries . There are two translations of it into French verse . The first of these is in the Cotton Library , Domit . A. IV . and the second in the Harleian , No . 273 , but they are not from the same pen : the former consists of near 1000 lines , and the latter of about 700 . M. Le Grand has given an analysis of one of these translations in his fabliaux , vol . V .; and it is upon the authority of this writer that I have ascribed it to Mary , as he maintains that she was the author of it , but without adducing the necessary proofs for this assertion . The Cotton MS. however , contains nothing that gives the least support to M. Le Grand 's opinion , or even screens it with probability . Neither is Mary 's name mentioned in the Harleian MS .; but as the translator , in his preface , entitles the work “ a lay , ” and professes he had rather engage in it than relate fables , it may afford a conjecture that Mary has sufficiently developed herself in speaking of her labours . This , however , is merely a conjecture . It is not impossible that the MS. which M. Le Grand consulted contained more particular details on this subject ; but he is certainly mistaken in one respect , and that is , in supposing Mary to have been the original author of this piece , whilst all the MSS . that exist attest that she could have been only the translator : and if the translation in the Harleian MS. actually be her performance , she there positively declares that she had been desired to translate the work from Latin into Romance .</p>
   <p>This poem was , at a very early period , translated into English verse . It is to be found in the Cotton library , Calig . A. II . under the title of Owayne Miles , on account , of Sir Owen being the hero of the piece , and whose descent into St. Patrick 's purgatory is related . Walter de Metz , author of the poem entitled Image du Monde , mentions also the wonders of St. Patrick 's purgatory , the various adventures of those who descended into it , and the condition of those who had the good fortune to return from it ; but I am uncertain whether he speaks from the original Latin of the monk of Saltrey , or from Mary 's French translation . In the latter case it should appear that Mary finished her translation before 1246 , the year in which Walter says he composed his work .<span type="note_anchor">[ 32 ]</span></p>
   <p>Whether Mary was the author of any other pieces I have not been able to ascertain : her taste , and the extreme facility with which she wrote poetry of the lighter kind , induce a presumption that she was ; but I know of none that have come down to us .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>It is reasonable to conclude , that writers flocked in greater numbers to the court where they were most in request , and were likely to be most liberally rewarded . Now it is evident that the Dukes of Normandy , when possessed of the crown of England , were incomparably more wealthy , though not in the same proportion more powerful , than the contemporary Kings of France ; and it may be presumed that the crowd of candidates for their patronage , was consequently , much more numerous . Our Henry the Second possessed , in right of his father , Maine , Anjou , and Touraine ; in right of his wife Eleanor , divorced by Louis le Jeune , the counties of Poictou and Guienne ; in right of his mother Matilda , Normandy and England ; and his power in the latter , the most valuable part of his dominions , was paramount and uncontrolled , while Louis was surrounded by powerful and rival vassals . We are , therefore , justified in suspecting that the courts of our Norman sovereigns , rather than those of the Kings of France , produced the birth of romance literature ; and this suspicion is confirmed by the testimony of three French writers , whose authority is the more conclusive , because they have formed their opinion from separate and independent premises .</p>
   <p>The first of these is M. de la Ravallere . In his Essay on the Revolutions of the French Language , a work of considerable learning , supported by original authorities , whose words he almost constantly quotes , he distinctly asserts that the pretended patronage of the French princes , anterior to Philippe Auguste , had no visible effect on their domestic literature ; that while so many poets were entertained at the courts of the Anglo-Norman princes , no one can be traced to that of Louis le Jeune ; that the chronicles of Britain and Normandy , the subjects chosen by Wace and his contemporaries , were not likely to interest the French , &amp; c .</p>
   <p>The second authority is M. le Comte de Tressan , a writer , perhaps , of no deep research , but whose good taste is conclusive on points of internal evidence . In his preface to the prose romance of “ La Fleur des Batailles , ” ( one of those relating to Charlemagne ) he says — The style and character of these romances lead us to think that they were composed at the court of the English kings , descended from William the Conqueror . We find in those of the Round Table , a marked affectation of dwelling on every thing which can contribute to the glory of the throne and court of England , whose princes and knights always play the chief and most brilliant part in the piece .</p>
   <p>Thirdly , the Abbé de la Rue may be considered as having proved the fact , by pointing out , in English history , the persons to whom the original romances were addressed . His three dissertations on the Anglo-Norman poets , in the twelfth and thirteenth volume of the Archaelogia , will convince the reader that no man has studied , with more attention , the early history and poetry of France ; and he has given it as his decided opinion , that “ it was from England and Normandy that the French received the first works which deserve to be cited in their language . ” — Ellis 's Specimens of Early English Metrical Romances .</p>

   <p>APPENDIX II .</p>
   <p>MARIE 'S LAYS .</p>
   <p>Versions of only two of the Lays can be given ; but it will be better to lay before the reader an abstract of the whole collection , which is in many respects interesting , because it was certainly written in this country , was never printed , and is known to exist only in one manuscript , viz . Harl . MSS . No . 978 .</p>
   <p>About 56 lines at the beginning of the work are intended as a general prologue ; and 26 more form the introduction to the first Lay . This prefatory matter is written in a style of considerable obscurity , which the author defends by the example of the ancients , and quotes Priscian as her authority . But the doctrine she means to inculcate is , that those who possess talents are bound to employ them ; and that study is always good as a preservative from vice and from affliction . She tells us , she had therefore form 'd a plan of translating , from Latin into romance , some good history , but found her project had been anticipated by others . She then thought of the numerous lays which she had heard , and carefully treasured in her memory . These , she was sure , must be new to the generality of her readers ; and , in this confidence , she offers to the king the fruits of her labours . After complaining she has met with envy and persecution where she deserved praise , she declares her intention to persevere , and relate , as briefly as possible , such stories as she knows to be true , and to have been formed into lays by the Britons .</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>A prince of Bretagne , so passionately attached to chivalrous amusements , that he cared neither for business nor gallantry . Nothing but the necessity of heading his troops could withdraw him from the pleasures of hunting and hawking ; and all affairs of state were managed by his steward , a man of equal loyalty and experience . Unfortunately this steward had a beautiful wife : the prince heard her much praised ; and insensibly began to think his sport most agreeable , when it conducted him , at the end of the day , to the steward 's castle ; where he had a natural opportunity of seeing and conversing with the lovely hostess . Overcome by his passion , almost before he was conscious of it , he began by reflecting on the baseness of the part he was preparing to act ; and ended , by determining not to endure the misery of privation and disappointment , if he could succeed in seducing her . Having devised , in the course of a sleepless night , as many arguments as were necessary to satisfy his own morality , and formed a plan for securing a long interview , he set off for the chase ; returning after a short time , under pretence of sudden indisposition , and retiring to bed , he sent to request a visit from the lady , who then received a very long and eloquent declaration of love . To this she replied , at first , by proper expostulations ; but when at length assured , with the utmost solemnity , that if her husband was dead she should become the partner of his throne , she suddenly gave way , and proposed , with his assistance , to destroy the steward , so artfully , that neither should incur the slightest suspicion . Equitan , far from being startled at this atrocious proposition , assured her of his concurrence , and she continued thus : “ Return , sir , for the present , to your court ; then come to pursue your diversion in this forest , and again take up your abode under our roof . You must once more pretend to be indisposed ; cause yourself to be blooded ; and on the third day order a bath , invite my husband to bathe and afterwards to dine with you . I will take care to prepare the bathing tubs : that which I destine for him shall be filled with boiling water , so that he will be instantly scalded to death ; after which you will call in your and his attendants , and explain to them how your affectionate steward had expired in the act of bathing . ” At the end of three months every thing was arranged for the execution of this diabolical plot ; but the steward , who had risen early for some purpose of business or amusement , happening to stay rather beyond the time , the lovers had met during his absence , forgetting that their guilty project was not yet accomplished . A maid was stationed at the door , near which stood the fatal bath ; but the husband returning with precipitation , suddenly forced it open , in spite of her feeble opposition , and discovered his wife in the arms of Equitan . The prince , under the first impulse of surprize and remorse , started from the bed , and , heedlessly plunging into the boiling bath , was instantly suffocated or scalded to death . The husband , almost at the same instant , seized on his guilty partner , and threw her headlong after her paramour . Thus were the wicked punished , by the means which they contrived for the destruction of another ; and such is the substance of the lay which was composed by the Bretons under the name of Equitan .</p>

     <l n="9">And some of joy and mirth also ;</l>
     <l n="10">And some of treachery and of guile ;</l>
     <l n="11">Of old aventures that fell while ;</l>

   <p>The Bretons never failed converting into lays all the anecdotes they thought worth consigning to memory ; and the following was thus composed , and called Lay le Fraine ( frêne ) , or “ The Aventure of the Ash . ”</p>
   <p>In the “ West countrie ” lived two knights , men of opulence , friends from their infancy , and married about the same time . One of the ladies having twins , her husband sent to announce the event to his friend .</p>

     <l n="1">The messenger goth , and hath nought forgete ,</l>

     <l n="12">“ Tway sones , sir , God hem save ! ”</l>
     <l n="13">The knight thereof was glad and blithe ,</l>
     <l n="14">And thonked Godes sonde swithe ,</l>
     <l n="15">And granted his errand in all thing ,</l>
     <l n="16">And gaf him a palfray for his tiding .</l>
     <l n="17">Then was the lady of the house</l>
     <l n="18">A proud dame , and malicious ,</l>
     <l n="19">Hoker-full , iche mis-segging ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 38 ]</span></l>
     <l n="20">Squeamous , and eke scorning ;</l>
     <l n="21">To iche woman she had envie ;</l>
     <l n="22">She spake these words of felonie :</l>
     <l n="23">“ Ich have wonder , thou messenger ,</l>
     <l n="24">Who was thy lordes conseillor ,</l>
     <l n="25">To teach him about to send ,</l>
     <l n="26">And tell shame in iche an end ! "[ 39 ]</l>
     <l n="27">“ That his wife hath tway children y-bore !</l>
     <l n="28">Well may iche man wite therfore</l>
     <l n="29">That tway men her han hodde in bower :</l>
     <l n="30">That is hir bothe dishonour ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The messenger was sorely abashed by these unexpected and unjust reflections ; the husband reprimanded his wife very severely for the intemperance of her tongue ; and all the women of the country , amongst whom the story rapidly circulated , united in prayer , that her calumny might receive some signal punishment . Accordingly , the lady shortly after brought into the world two daughters . She was now reduced to the alternative of avowing herself guilty of a calumny against her innocent neighbour , or of imputing to herself , in common with the other , a crime of which she had not been guilty ; unless she could contrive to remove one of the twins . The project of destroying her own child , was , at first , rejected with horror ; but after revolving the subject in her mind , and canvassing with great logical acuteness the objections to this atrocious measure , she determined to adopt it , because she could ultimately cleanse herself from the sin , by doing private penance , and obtaining absolution .</p>
   <p>Having thus removed her scruples , she called the midwife , and directed her to destroy one of the infants , and to declare that one only had been born . But she refused ; and the unnatural mother was reduced to seek for a more submissive and supple agent . She had a maid-servant , educated in the family , to whom she imparted her difficulties ; and this confidential counsellor at once proposed a contrivance for removing them : “ Give me the child , ” said she , “ and be assured that , without destroying , I will so remove it , that it shall never give you any further trouble . There are many religious houses in the neighbourhood , whose inhabitants cannot be better employed than in nursing and educating orphan children . I will take care your infant shall be discovered by some of these good people , under whose care , by the blessing of Providence , it will thrive and prosper ; and in the mean time I will take such means that its health shall not suffer . Dismiss your sorrow , therefore , and trust in my discretion . ” The lady was overjoyed , and accepted the offer with assurances of eternal gratitude .</p>
   <p>As it was her wish that those who should find the child might know it was born of noble parents ,</p>

   <p>The young rival of Le Frain was distinguished like her sister , by a sylvan appellation ; her name was Le Codre ( Corylus , the Hazel ) , and the knight 's tenants had sagaciously drawn a most favourable prognostic of his future happiness , from the superiority of nuts to vile ash-keys ; but neither he nor any of his household were disposed to augur favourably of a marriage which tended to deprive them of the amiable orphan . The feast was magnificent , but dull ; and never were apparent rejoicings more completely marred by a general feeling of constraint and formality . Le Frain alone , concealing the grief which preyed on her heart , was all zeal and activity ; and , by her unceasing attentions , conciliated the pity and esteem of the bride , and even of her mother , who had hitherto felt the utmost anxiety to procure her dismissal . At the conclusion of the banquet she employed herself in the decoration of the bridal chamber , and having observed that the covering of the bed was not sufficiently costly , spread over it the magnificent mantle she had received from the abbess , and had hitherto preserved with the utmost solicitude . She had scarcely left the room when the bride entered it accompanied by her mother , who casting her eyes on this splendid mantle , surveyed it with feelings of the most poignant remorse , and immediately recognized the testimony of her crime . She questioned the chamberlains , who were unable to explain the appearance of an ornament they had never before beheld ; she then interrogated Le Frain , and , at the end of a short examination , fell into a swoon , exclaiming , “ Fair child , thou art my daughter ! ” Her husband was then summoned , and she confessed to him with tears , and every expression of penitence , the sinful act she had committed , and the providential discovery of her daughter by means of the mantle and the ring , both of which were presents from himself . The knight embraced his child with the utmost tenderness , and prevailed on the bishop to dissolve the just solemnized marriage , and unite their son-in-law to the original object of his affections . The other sister was shortly after bestowed on a neighbouring lord , and the adventures of Le Frain and Le Codre were formed into a Lay , which received its name from the former .</p>

     <l n="46">No . IV .— BISCLAVERET .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>This is the Breton name for an animal , which the Normans call Garwolf ; into whose form men were often formerly metamorphosed ; and during such times were the most ferocious and destructive inhabitants of the forest .</p>
   <p>There lived formerly in Bretagne a baron , comely in his person , wise , courteous , adored by his neighbours , much beloved by his sovereign , and married to a noble and beautiful lady , for whom he felt the warmest affection , which she appeared to return . But she had observed , her husband was regularly absent during three days in the week ; and , suspecting there must be something mysterious in this periodical disappearance , resolved , if possible , to extort the secret . She redoubled her expressions of tenderness , bitterly lamented her frequent intervals of solitude , and , affecting to be persuaded that they were spent with a mistress , conjured him to calm her apprehensions by a disclosure of the truth . The good baron in his turn begged her to desist from an enquiry which would only lead to their permanent separation , and the extinction of all her fondness ; but her tears and blandishments prevailed , and he confessed that , during half the week , he became a Bisclaveret . The lady , though she felt a secret horror at finding herself the wife of a wolf , pursued her enquiry ;— Were his clothes also transformed at the same time ? the baron answered , that he was naked : where , then , did he leave his dress ? To this question he endeavoured to avoid giving an answer ; declaring , should that be discovered , he should be condemned to wear his brute form through life ; and observing that , if she loved him , she could have no wish to learn a secret , useless to her , and in its disclosure fatal to himself . But obstinacy is always an over-match for rational argument : she still insisted ; and the good-natured husband ultimately told that , “ by the side of an old chapel , situated on the road to the thickest part of the forest , was a bush , which overhang and concealed an excavated stone , in which he constantly deposited his garments . ” The wife , now mistress of his fate , quickly sent for a gallant , whose love she had hitherto rejected ; taught him the means of confirming the baron 's metamorphosis ; and , when their friends had renounced all hope of his return , married her new favourite , and conveyed to him a large inheritance , the fruit of their joint treachery . In about a year the king went to hunt in the forest , and after a chase which lasted the whole day , had nearly run down the unfortunate Bisclaveret , when the persecuted animal rushed from the thicket , and running straight up to him , seized his stirrup with his fore-paw , began to lick his feet , and with the most piteous whinings to implore his protection . The king was , at first dreadfully frightened , but his fear gave way to pity and admiration . He called his attendants to witness the miracle ; ordered the dogs to be whipped off , solemnly took the brute under his royal protection ; and returned to his palace , closely followed by his savage attendant . Bisclaveret became an universal favourite ; he was fed with the greatest care , slept in the royal apartments , and though indefatigable in attentions to his master , returned the caresses of the courtiers , who admired and esteemed , without envying his superior intelligence and accomplishments . At length , the king having summoned a plenar at court , his barons flocked from all quarters , and , among the rest the husband of the false lady . No one had thought of paying the least attention to Bisclaveret , whose gentleness was even more remarkable than his sagacity ; but no sooner did the knight make his appearance than the animal attacked him with the greatest fury , and was scarcely prevented , even by the interposition of the king himself , from tearing him to pieces . The same scene occurred a second time , and occasioned infinite surprise . Not long after this , the king went to hunt in the same forest , and the wicked wife , as lady of the manor , having sent before her a magnificent present , set forth to pay her court to her sovereign . Bisclaveret saw her approach , flew upon her , and instantly tore her nose from her face . This act of discourtesy to a lady excited universal indignation : even the king took part against his favourite , who would have been punished with instant death , but for the interference of an aged counsellor . “ This lady , Sir , ” said he to the king , “ is wife of that knight whom you so tenderly loved , and whose unaccountable disappearance you have so long regretted . ” The baron whom Bisclaveret first assaulted is her present husband . He becomes ferocious only on the appearance of these two ; there is some mystery in this , which the lady , if imprisoned and interrogated would probably discover . Britany is the country of wonders —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Mainte marveille avuns veu</l>
     <l n="2">Qui en Bretaigne est avenu .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In compliance with this advice the lady was put in close confinement , the whole secret extorted , and the clothes of Bisclaveret duly restored . But when they were brought before him the animal appeared to survey them with listlessness and inattention ; and the king had again recourse to his sapient counsellor , by whose advice they were transferred to the royal bed-chamber , where Bisclaveret was left , without witnesses , to effect , if possible , his metamorphosis . In due time the king , attended with two of his barons , repaired to the chamber , and found the knight in his natural form , asleep on the royal bed . His master immediately embraced him with the utmost affection , restored all his estates ; added more , and banished the wicked wife , together with her paramour , from the country . It is remarkable that afterwards she had several children , all of whom were females , and distinguished by the disagreeable singularity of being born without noses . Be assured that this adventure is strictly true , and that the Lay of Bisclaveret was composed for the purpose of making it known to the latest posterity .</p>
   <p>No . V .— The Lay of SIR LANVAL .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">It was the time of Pentecost the bless 'd ,</l>
     <l n="2">When royal Arthur held the accustom 'd feast ,</l>
     <l n="3">When Carduel 's walls contained the vast resort</l>
     <l n="4">That press 'd from every land to grace his plenar court .</l>
     <l n="5">There did the sovereign 's copious hand dispense</l>
     <l n="6">Large boons to all with free magnificence ,</l>
     <l n="7">To all but one ; from Bretany he came ,</l>
     <l n="8">A goodly knight , Sir Lanval was his name .</l>
     <l n="9">Long had the king , by partial temper sway 'd ,</l>
     <l n="10">His loyal zeal with cold neglect repaid ;</l>
     <l n="11">Yet from a throne Sir Lanval drew his birth ,</l>
     <l n="12">Nor could all England boast more comeliness and worth .</l>
     <l n="13">Whate'er the cause , no gift the monarch gave ,</l>
     <l n="14">The knight with honest pride forbore to crave ,</l>
     <l n="15">Till at the last , his substance all forespent ,</l>
     <l n="16">From his lord 's court the hopeless liegeman went .</l>
     <l n="17">No leave he took , he told no mortal wight ,</l>
     <l n="18">Scarce had he thought to guide his steps aright ,</l>
     <l n="19">But all at random , reckless of his way ,</l>
     <l n="20">He wander 'd on the better half of day .</l>
     <l n="21">Ere evening fell he reached a pleasant mead ,</l>
     <l n="22">And there he loos 'd his beast , at will to rest or feed ;</l>
     <l n="23">Then by a brook-side down his limbs he cast</l>
     <l n="24">And , pondering on the waters as they pass 'd ,</l>
     <l n="25">The while his cloak his bended arm sustain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="26">Sadly he sat , and much in thought complain 'd .</l>
     <l n="27">So mus 'd he long , till by the frequent tread</l>
     <l n="28">Of quickening feet constrain 'd , he turn 'd his head ;</l>
     <l n="29">Close by his side there stood a female pair ,</l>
     <l n="30">Both richly clad , and both enchanting fair ;</l>
     <l n="31">With courteous guise the wondering knight they greet</l>
     <l n="32">With winning speech , with invitation sweet</l>
     <l n="33">From their kind mistress , where at ease she lay ,</l>
     <l n="34">And in her tent beguil 'd the lingering day .</l>
     <l n="35">Awhile Sir Lanval reft of sense appear 'd ;</l>
     <l n="36">Then up at once his mailed limbs he rear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="37">And with his guides impatient to proceed ,</l>
     <l n="38">Though a true knight , for once forgot his steed .</l>
     <l n="39">And now with costliest silk superbly dight ,</l>
     <l n="40">A gay pavilion greets the warrior 's sight ;</l>
     <l n="41">Its taper spire a towering eagle crown 'd ,</l>
     <l n="42">In substance gold , of workmanship renown 'd .</l>
     <l n="43">Within , recumbent on a couch , was laid</l>
     <l n="44">A form more perfect than e'er man survey 'd :</l>
     <l n="45">The new-blown rose , the lily 's virgin prime ,</l>
     <l n="46">In the fresh hour of fragrant summer-time ,</l>
     <l n="47">Though of all flowers the fairest of the fair ,</l>
     <l n="48">With this sweet paragon might ill compare ;</l>
     <l n="49">And o'er her shoulders flow 'd with graceful pride ,</l>
     <l n="50">Though for the heat some little cast aside ,</l>
     <l n="51">A crimson pall of Alexandria 's dye ,</l>
     <l n="52">With snowy ermine lin 'd , befitting royalty ;</l>
     <l n="53">Yet was her skin , where chance bewray 'd the sight ,</l>
     <l n="54">Far purer than the snowy ermine 's white .</l>
     <l n="55">‘ Lanval ! ’ she cried , as in amazed mood ,</l>
     <l n="56">Of speech and motion void , the warrior stood ,</l>
     <l n="57">‘ Lanval ! ’ she cried , ‘'tis you I seek for here ;</l>
     <l n="58">Your worth has won me : knight , I love thee dear ;</l>
     <l n="59">And of my love such proof will soon impart ,</l>
     <l n="60">Shall wing with envy thy proud sovereign 's heart :</l>
     <l n="61">Then slighted merit shall be fully known ,</l>
     <l n="62">And kings repine at wealth beyond their own . ’</l>
     <l n="63">Words such as these arous 'd the astonish 'd knight ,</l>
     <l n="64">He felt love 's kindling flame inspire his spright ,</l>
     <l n="65">And , ‘ O pure paragon , ’ he straight replied ,</l>
     <l n="66">‘ Thy love is all ! I hold no wish beside !</l>
     <l n="67">If bliss so rare thy favouring lips decree ,</l>
     <l n="68">No deed shall foil thy champion 's chivalry ;</l>
     <l n="69">No toil shall wear , no danger shall dismay ,</l>
     <l n="70">Let my queen will , and Lanval must obey :</l>
     <l n="71">So may I thrive as , from this moment bless 'd ,</l>
     <l n="72">One hope I cherish , one sole boon request ,</l>
     <l n="73">Thy winning form , thy fostering smiles to see ,</l>
     <l n="74">And never , never more to part from thee . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="75">So speaking ceas 'd awhile the enraptur 'd knight ,</l>
     <l n="76">For now the two fair damsels met his sight ;</l>
     <l n="77">Each on her arm resplendent vestments brought ,</l>
     <l n="78">Fresh from the loom , magnificently wrought :</l>
     <l n="79">Enrob 'd in them , with added grace he mov 'd ,</l>
     <l n="80">As one by nature form 'd to be belov 'd ;</l>
     <l n="81">And , by the fairy to the banquet led ,</l>
     <l n="82">And placed beside her on one genial bed ,</l>
     <l n="83">Whiles the twain handmaids every want supplied ,</l>
     <l n="84">Cates were his fare to mortal man denied :</l>
     <l n="85">Yet was there one , the foremost of the feast ,</l>
     <l n="86">One food there was far sweeter than the rest ,</l>
     <l n="87">One food there was did feed the warriors flame ,</l>
     <l n="88">For from his lady 's lovely lips it came .</l>

     <l n="92">There dream the remnant of his life away :</l>
     <l n="93">But o'er their loves his dew still evening shed ,</l>
     <l n="94">Night gathered on amain , and thus the fairy said ;</l>
     <l n="95">‘ Rise , knight ! I may not longer keep thee here ;</l>
     <l n="96">Back to the court return and nothing fear ,</l>
     <l n="97">There , in all princely cost , profusely free ,</l>

     <l n="110">Nor wilt thou ever more behold thy friend : ’ —</l>
     <l n="111">Here , with a parting kiss , broke off the fay ,</l>
     <l n="112">‘ Farewell ! ’ she cried , and sudden pass 'd away .</l>
     <l n="113">The knight look 'd up , and just without the tent</l>

     <l n="116">And to the towers of Carduel turn 'd the rein ;</l>
     <l n="117">Yet ever and anon he look 'd behind</l>
     <l n="118">With strange amaz 'd uncertainty of mind ,</l>
     <l n="119">As one who hop 'd some further proofs to spy</l>
     <l n="120">If all were airy dream or just reality .</l>

   <p>Thomas Chestre translated this tale in the reign of Henry 6 , but the extracts published by Mr. Warton , differ in some particulars from the tale here given .</p>
   <p>No . VI .— LES DEUX AMANTS .</p>
   <p>In Neustria , now called Normandy is a single mountain of unusual height and verdure , railed the mountain “ of the two lovers , ” in consequence of an adventure to which it gave rise , and of which the Bretons have formed a lay . Close to it are the remains of a city , now reduced to a few houses , but formerly opulent , founded by the king of the Pistreins , whence it was called Depistreins , and the neighbouring valley Val de Pistre . This king had one only daughter , whom he loved so much that he could not bear to be separated from her . With a view to check the pursuits of the lovers , whom her beauty and accomplishments attracted , he published a decree , that her hand should never be granted but to a suitor who should be able to carry her , without resting , from the bottom to the top of the adjoining mountain . Many attempted the enterprise , for presumption is common ; none achieved it , because its execution was barely possible . The suitors disappeared , one by one , and the beautiful princess seemed doomed to eternal celibacy . There was one youth , the son of a neighbouring baron , who was a favourite with the king and the whole court , and whose assiduities , which were dictated by an unconquerable and sincere passion , ultimately gained the lady 's warmest affections . It was long a secret to all the world : but this discretion became , at length , almost intolerable ; and the youth , hopeless of fulfilling the condition which alone could obtain her hand , earnestly conjured her to fly from her father 's court . To this she would not consent , but suggested a mode of accomplishing their wishes more compatible with her filial piety : “ I have , ” said she , “ a rich aunt , who resides , and has studied during thirty years , at Salerno . In that celebrated school she has so completely acquired the art of medicine ; has learned so many salves and drugs ; has so studied herbs and roots , that she will be enabled to compose for you electuaries and drinks , capable of communicating the degree of vigour necessary to the accomplishment of the trial prescribed by my father . To her you shall bear a letter from me , and at your return shall demand me from the king , on the terms to which he has himself assented . ” The lover thanked her ; went home , provided the necessary assortment of rich clothes , and other merchandize , of palfreys , beasts of burthen and attendants , and set off for Salerno . His mission was successful : the good aunt 's electuaries rendered him much more athletic than before ; and he brought back , in a small vial , an elixir capable of instantly restoring strength at the moment of complete exhaustion . He therefore was full of confidence , and claimed the trial . The king having summoned all his principal vassals to behold the ceremony , conducted his daughter into the great plain on the banks of the Seine , and found the youth already stationed at the foot of the mountain . The lovely princess had scarcely tasted food since the departure of her lover ; she would gladly have wasted herself to the lightness of air for the purpose of diminishing his labour . She wore only a single robe which closely enveloped her . Her lover catching her up with one hand , and bearing the precious vial in the other , appeared perfectly unconscious of the burthen , and bore her , with the rapidity of lightning , more than half way up the mountain : but here she perceived his breath began to fail , and conjured him to have recourse to his medicine . He replied , that he was still full of vigour ; was too much within sight of the multitude below , that their cries on seeing him stop , even for an instant , would annoy and dishearten him ; and that , while able to proceed alone , he would not appeal to preternatural assistance . At two-thirds of the height she felt him totter under the weight , and again repeated her earnest entreaties . But he no longer heard or listened : exerting his whole remains of strength , he staggered with her to the top , still bearing the untasted vial in his hand , and dropped dead on the ground . His mistress , thinking he had only fainted , knelt down by his side , applied the elixir to his lips , but found that life had left him . She then dashed the vial on the ground , uttered a dreadful shriek , threw herself on the body , and instantly expired . The king and his attendants , much surprized at not seeing them return , ascended the mountain , and found the youth fast locked in the arms of the princess . By command of her father they were buried on the spot in a marble coffin , and the mountain still retains the name of “ The Two Lovers . ” Around their tomb the ground exhibits an unceasing verdure ; and hither the whole country resort for the most valuable herbs employed in medicine , which owe their origin to the contents of the marvellous vial .<span type="note_anchor">[ 77 ]</span></p>
   <p>No . VII .— YWONEC .</p>
   <p>There lived once in Britain a rich old knight , lord of Caerwent , a city situated on the river Duglas . He had married , when far advanced in years , a young wife of high birth , and transcendant beauty , in hopes of having an heir ; but when , at the end of seven years , this hope was frustrated , he locked her up in his strong castle , under the care of his sister , an aged widow lady , of great devotion and asperity of temper . His own amusements were confined to the chace ; those of his sister to thumbing the Psalter , and chanting its contents : the young lady had no solace but tears . One morning in April , when the birds began to sing the songs of love , the old gentleman had risen early , and awakened his sister , who carefully shut the doors after him , while he sallied forth for the woods , and his young wife began her usual lamentations . She execrated the hour when she was born , and the fatal avarice of her parents , for having united her to an old , jealous tyrant , afraid of his own shadow , who debarred her even from going to church . She had heard the country round her prison was once famed for adventures ; that young and gallant knights used to meet , without censure or impediment , beautiful and affectionate mistresses ; but her lot was endless misery ( for her tyrant was certainly immortal ) , unless the supreme Disposer of events should , by some miracle , suspend the listlessness of her existence . She had scarcely finished this ejaculation , when the shadow of a bird , which nearly intercepted all the light proceeding from the narrow window of her room , arrested her attention , and a falcon of the largest size flew into the chamber , and perched at the foot of her bed . While she gazed , it gradually assumed the figure of a young and handsome knight . She started , changed colour , and drew a veil over her face , but still gazed and listened , with some fear , much astonishment , but more pleasure . The knight soon broke silence . He begged her not to be alarmed ; confessed his mode of visiting was new , and rather mysterious ; but that a falcon was a gentle and noble bird , whose figure ought not to create suspicion . He was a neighbouring prince , who had long loved her , and wished to dedicate the remainder of his days to her service . The lady , gradually removing her veil , ingenuously told him , he was much handsomer , and apparently more amiable , than any man she had ever seen ; and she should be happy to accept him as a lover , if such a connection could be legitimate , and if he was orthodox . The prince entered at large into the articles of his creed ; and concluded by advising that she should feign herself sick , send for his chaplain , and direct him to bring the host ; “ when , ” said he , “ I will assume your appearance , and receive the Sacrament in your stead . ” The lady was satisfied with this proposal ; and , when the old woman came in , and summoned her to rise , she professed to be at the point of death , and entreated the immediate assistance of the chaplain . Such a request , in the absence of her lord , could not be regularly granted ; but a few screams , and a fainting fit , removed the old lady 's doubts , and she hobbled off in search of the chaplain , who immediately brought the host ; and Muldumaric ( the falcon-prince ) assuming the appearance of his mistress , went through the sacred ceremony with becoming devotion , which they both considered as a marriage contract . The lady 's supposed illness enabled the prince to protract his visit ; but at length the moment of separation came , and she expressed her wish for the frequent repetition of their interviews .— “ Nothing is so easy , ” said Muldumaric ; “ whenever you express an ardent wish to see me , I will instantly come . But beware of that old woman : she will probably discover our secret , and betray it to her brother ; and I announce to you , the moment of discovery will be that of my death . ” With these words he flew off . His mistress , with all her caution , was unable to conceal entirely the complete change in her sensations . Her solitude , formerly so irksome , became the source of her greatest delight ; her person , so long neglected , again was an object of solicitude ; and her artful and jealous husband , on his return from the chase , often discovered in her features the traces of a satisfaction his conscience told him he was not the author of . His vague suspicions were , after a time , communicated to his sister ; but being , as she thought , the young lady 's sole companion , and not able to reproach herself with any enlivening qualities , she could not account for this contented demeanour . At length she was commanded to conceal herself in his wife 's apartments during his absence , to watch indefatigably , and report whatever she could discover . The result was a full confirmation of all his suspicions . He now exerted himself in devising means of vengeance : he secretly prepared and placed before the fatal window a trap , composed of sharpened steel arrows , and , rising long before day , set off on his usual occupation . The old lady , carefully shutting the doors after him , returned to her bed till day break ; and his wife , awakened at this unusual hour , could not refrain from uttering an ardent wish for the company of her dear Muldumaric . He was instantly at her side ; but had received his death wound , and she found herself sprinkled with his blood . Overpowered by fear and surprize , she could scarcely hear him say he died for her , and that his prophecy was accomplished . She fainted in his arms ; but he conjured her to preserve her life , and announcing she would have a son , whom she must call Ywonec , and who was destined to be the avenger of both his parents . He then hastily departed through an open and unguarded window . His mistress , uttering a piteous scream , threw herself out of the same window , and pursued his flight by the trace of his blood , which the first beams of morning enabled her to distinguish . At length she arrived at a thick wood , where she was soon surrounded with darkness ; but pursued the beaten track , and emerged into a meadow , where , recovering the trace of blood , she pursued it to a large city of unexampled magnificence , which she entered , and proceeded to the palace . No one was visible in the streets . In the first apartment she found a knight asleep . She knew him not , and passed on to the next , where she found a second equally unknown to her . She entered the third room ; and on a bed , which almost dazzled her by the splendour of its ornaments , and which was surrounded by numerous torches blazing in golden candlesticks , she recognised her dear Muldumaric , and sunk almost lifeless with fatigue and terror by his side . Though very near his last moments , he was still able to comfort and instruct her . He adjured her to return instantly , while she could escape the notice of his subjects , to whom , as their story was known , she would be particularly obnoxious . He gave her a ring , in virtue of which he assured her she would in future escape the persecution , and even the jealousy of her husband . He then put into her hands his sword , with directions that it should never be touched by man till his son was dubbed a knight ; when it must be delivered to him with due solemnity , near the tomb of his father , at the moment he should learn the secret of his birth , and the miseries produced by it . She would then see the first use to which her boy would put it . The prince had nearly spent his last breath in the service of his beloved mistress ; he could only instruct her by signs to put on a magnificent robe which lay near him , and hasten her departure . She staggered through the town , arrived in the solitary fields , heard the distant knell announce her lover 's death , and sunk exhausted to the ground . At length the air revived her ; she slowly renewed her journey , and returned to her castle , which , by virtue of her ring , she entered undisturbed . Till the birth of her son , and from that time to the conclusion of his education , she lived in silent anguish , and in patient expectation of the day of vengeance . The young Ywonec , by his beauty and address , recalled to her mind the loved image of his father ; and at length she beheld him , with a throbbing heart , invested , amidst the applause of all the spectators , with the dignity of knighthood . The hour of retribution was now fast approaching . At the feast of St. Aaron , in the same year , the baron was summoned with his family to Caerleon , where the festival was held with great solemnity . In the course of their journey they stopped for the night in a spacious abbey , where they were received with the greatest hospitality . The good abbot , for the purpose of detaining his guests another day , exhibited to them the whole of the apartments , the dormitory , the refectory , and the chapter-house , in which they beheld a vast sepulchral monument , covered with a superb pall , fringed with gold , and surrounded by twenty waxen tapers in golden candlesticks , while a vast silver censer , constantly burning , filled the air with fumes of incense . The guests naturally inquired concerning the name and quality of the person who reposed in that splendid tomb ; and were told it was the late king of that country ; the best , the handsomest , the wisest , the most courteous and liberal of mankind ; that he was treacherously slain at Caerwent , for his love to the lady of that castle ; that since his death his subjects had respected his dying injunctions , and reserved the crown for a son , whose arrival they still expected with much anxiety . On hearing this story the lady cried aloud to Ywonec , “ Fair son , thou hast heard how Providence hath conducted us hither . Here lies thy father whom this old man slew with felony . I now put into thy hands the sword of thy sire ; I have kept it long enough . ” She then proceeded to tell him the sad adventure of his birth , and , having with much difficulty concluded the recital , fell dead on the tomb of her husband . Ywonec , almost frantic with grief and horror , instantly sacrificed his hoary stepfather to the manes of his parents , and having caused his mother to be interred with suitable honours , accepted from his subjects the crown they had reserved for the representative of a long line of royal ancestors .</p>

   <p>The author tells us , this lay is called , in the Breton tongue , Laustic ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 78 ]</span>and in “ right English , ” the Nihtegale ( Nightingale ) . It is very well written , and contains many picturesque descriptions ; in the district of St. Malos is the town of Bon , which derives its name from the goodness of two knights who formerly dwelt in it . One was married ; the other was in love with his neighbour 's wife , who returned his affection . The houses were so near , being only separated by a wall , that they could easily , from the windows of their respective bed chambers , interchange glances , talk without being overheard , and toss to each other little presents and symbols of attachment . For the purpose of enjoying this amusement , the lady , during the warm nights of spring and summer , used to rise , and throwing a mantle over her , repair to the window , and stay there till near the dawn of day . Her husband , much annoyed by this practice , roughly asked what was the object which so constantly allured her from her bed , and was told that it was the sweet voice of the Nightingale . Having heard this he set all his servants to work , spread on every twig of his hazels and chesnut trees a quantity of bird-lime , and set throughout the orchard so many traps and springs , that the nightingale was shortly caught . Immediately running to his wife , and twisting the bird 's neck , he tossed it into her bosom so hastily that she was sprinkled with the blood ; adding that her enemy was now dead , and she might in future sleep in quiet . The lady , who , it seems , was not fertile in expedients , submitted to the loss of her nightly conversations , and was contented with exculpating herself towards her lover by sending him the dead bird inclosed in a bag of white satin , on which she embroidered the history of its fate ; and her gallant paramour caused his mistress 's present to be inclosed in a golden box , richly studded with gems , which he constantly carried about his person .<span type="note_anchor">[ 79 ]</span></p>

     <l n="3">No . IX .— MILUN .<span type="note_anchor">[ 80 ]</span></l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Milun was a knight of South Wales . His strength and prowess were such , that he never met an adversary who was able to unhorse him . His reputation spread far beyond the borders of his own country , and he was known and admired in Ireland , Norway , Gothland , Loegria ( England ) , and Albany ( Scotland ) . At no great distance from his castle dwelt an opulent baron , who had an only daughter , courteous and beautiful . Hearing his praises from all quarters , she became enamoured , and sent a messenger to say , her heart was at his service if he thought it worth acceptance . Milun , whose affections were not pre-engaged , returned an answer expressive of gratitude , sent his gold ring as a symbol of inviolable constancy ; and , having fixed her messenger in his interests by magnificent presents , arranged with him a secure place of meeting . Their intercourse was managed so discreetly as to excite no suspicion ; till the young lady , sending for her lover , represented to him that longer concealment was impossible . By an ancient law she was subject , on discovery , at her father 's option , to be punished with instant death or sold as a slave ; and she saw no means of escaping this frightful alternative . Milun listened in silent horror , but could suggest no expedient , when her old nurse undertook to conceal the rest , if the child could be properly disposed of ; and for this the young lady found a ready contrivance . She had a sister richly married in Northumberland , to whom Milun might cause the child to be conveyed , with a letter explaining all , and his gold ring , by means of which it might , in due time , discover and make itself known to its parents . It proved to be a boy ; the ring was hung about its neck , with a purse containing the letter ; he was placed in a soft cradle , swathed in the finest linen , with an embroidered pillow under his head , and a rich coverlid edged with sable to protect him from the cold . Milun , in delivering him to the attendants , ordered that during the journey he should stop seven times in the day , for the purpose of being washed , fed , and put to sleep . The nurse , and all the servants who attended , had been selected with great care , and performed their charge with fidelity ; and the Northumbrian lady assured her sister , by a letter which they brought back , that she accepted the charge with pleasure . This being settled , Milun left his castle for a short time on some military business , and during his absence the young lady 's father resolved to bestow her in marriage on a neighbouring baron . She was now almost reduced to despair , her lover , to whom she was more than ever attached , was absent ; to avow to her new husband what had happened was impossible , and to conceal it extremely difficult . But she was compelled to submit . The marriage took place ; and Milun , on his return , was scarcely less distressed than his mistress , till he recollected she was still in the neighbourhood , and he might perhaps be able to devise some means of procuring an interview . He had a favourite swan , long accustomed to feed out of his hand . Having written and sealed a letter , he tied it round its neck , and finding it effectually concealed by the feathers , called a favourite servant , and directed him to repair to the lady 's habitation , devise some contrivance for gaining admission , and deliver the same into her own hands . The man executed his commission with great ingenuity . He represented himself to the porter of the castle as a poacher ; stated that he had just caught a fine swan close to Caerleon ; and much wished to conciliate the future intercession of the lady by presenting it to her . The porter , after some hesitation , went to explore the anti-chamber ; and , finding in it only two knights , intent on a game of chess , returned immediately , and conducted the man to his lady 's apartment , which , on his knocking , was opened to them . Having graciously accepted the present , she was going to recommend the swan to the care of one of her valets ; but the messenger observing “ it was a royal bird , who would only accept food from her own hand , ” and desiring her to caress it , she soon perceived the letter , and changed colour , but recovering herself , dismissed the messenger with a present , turned out her own attendants , excepting one maid , and proceeded to examine the mystery . It contained the warmest protestations of her lover 's unalterable attachment , expressed a hope that she might be able to point out a secure place of meeting ; and shewed her an easy method of continuing the correspondence . “ The swan , already tame , might , by good feeding , be easily attached to her ; after which , if debarred from meat during three days , he would , when set at liberty , fly back to his old master . ” After kissing the welcome letter till she had nearly obliterated its contents she proceeded to put in practice his injunctions ; and having by stealth procured some parchment and ink , made an equally tender reply , which , being tied round the swan 's neck , was rapidly and faithfully conveyed to Milun . During twenty years they kept up , by this means , a regular correspondence , and their frequent interviews were managed with a secresy which secured them against detection . In the mean time their son , after receiving an excellent education , had been dubbed a knight , and learned from his aunt the name of his father , and the mystery of his birth . Inflamed with a noble ambition , he resolved instantly to set off for foreign countries and to surpass his sire in military glory . The next day he communicated the project to his aunt , who gave him a number of instructions for his future conduct ; which , lest he should forget , she repeated more than once , and accompanied her admonitions with such liberal presents as would enable him to rival in splendour the richest of his competitors . He repaired to Southampton ; landed at Barbefluet ( Barfleur ) ; passed into Britany ; engaged , by his generosity , a numerous attendance of poor knights , eclipsed the proudest of his rivals by superior liberality ; vanquished the stoutest ; gained the prize in every tournament ; and , though he concealed his name , was quickly known through the country by the appellation of “ The Knight without a Peer . ” The fame of this youthful warrior at length reached the care of his father . From the first moment of his bestriding a horse , that father had never encountered an equal ; and as he trusted age had added to his address more than it had yet subtracted from his vigour , he hoped to prove , by the overthrow of this unknown , that his high renown was owing to the absence of Milun . After this exploit he meant to go in quest of his son , whose departure into foreign countries he had lately learnt , and having obtained the permission of his mistress , embarked for Normandy , and thence proceeded into Bretagne . The tournaments did not begin till the festival of Easter ; Milun , therefore , who arrived before the end of winter , spent the interval in travelling from place to place , in exercising hospitality , and searching out the most meritorious knights , whom he attached to himself by his liberality . At length the festival took place , at Mont St. Michel , and was attended by a crowd of French , Flemish , Norman and Breton , knights , though by very few English . Milun enquired minutely into the arms and devises of the unknown knight , and had no difficulty in procuring ample information . The tournament began : the two rivals separately acquired a manifest superiority , and bore down all who opposed them , but the opinions of the assembly were divided between the two . The strength and address of the veteran appeared invincible , yet the suppleness and activity of the youth attracted still more admiration . Even Milun himself beheld him with a mixture of wonder and delight , and summoned all his skill and strength when he rode to encounter this formidable adversary . His spear was too well-directed to miss its aim ; but it flew into a thousand splinters , while that of the youth remained entire , and threw him at some distance upon the ground . By the violence of the shock the ventail of his helmet was broken off , and displayed his beard and hair , gray with age ; when the youth , bringing back his horse , courteously requested him to remount , expressing his regret at having , by his accidental victory , sullied the fame of a respectable veteran . Milun , surveying him with increased admiration , discovered on his finger , while he held the rein , his own ring , and earnestly conjured him to relate his history , and the names of his parents . He obeyed , and was proceeding to tell all he knew , when the old knight again springing from his horse , and catching him by the skirts of his coat of mail , hailed him as his son , and received him in his arms as he dismounted to request the paternal benediction . The tournament being over , they retired amidst the tears and applauses of the assembly , and retreated to their inn , where Milun related the whole series of his adventures . The young man listened till the end with respectful attention ; and then exclaimed , “ In faith , fair sire , I will unite you to my mother . I will kill her present husband , and you shall marry her . ” This being arranged , they parted for the night . On the next day they arrived at the sea : embarked ; landed in Wales after a short and pleasant passage ; and were proceeding to Milun 's castle , when they were met by a messenger bearing a letter to Milun from his lady , in which she announced the death of her husband , and requested him to hasten his return . At this joyful news they hurried on to the lady 's castle ; and she had the satisfaction of being for ever united to her lover , at the same time that she embraced a son every way worthy of his accomplished parents . On this occasion says the author , “ the ancients made a lay which I have here set down in writing , and which I always relate with fresh pleasure . ”</p>

   <p>There lived formerly , at Nantes in Bretagne , a lady of such exquisite beauty that no one could behold her with impunity . All the young men of the town were rivals for her smiles ; but four , nearly of the same age , and of equal birth and accomplishments , soon eclipsed all the rest of the competitors . Each of these four deserved , and obtained , a place in her affections ; but their merits were so equal that she was unable to make a choice . At tournaments she sent to all some mark of distinction ; a ring , a scarf , a pennant , or other ornament ; and all ascribed to her , as mistress of their actions , the exploits they had the good fortune to perform . It happened once , that Nantes was appointed for the celebration of a tournament at the Easter festival . The four knights set out to meet the foreign ones , and proposed to joust with an equal number : the offer was accepted , and the contest ended to the advantage of the town . On the following day the four young lovers still further distinguished themselves ; but the spectacle at length degenerated , as was frequently the case , into a real combat , in which three out of the four were accidentally slain , and the fourth dangerously wounded . They were brought back to the lady , who caused the three to be magnificently interred , and summoned the best physicians of the town to assist her attendance on the survivor . Their joint efforts were at length successful . He became convalescent ; and , finding his passion revive with his returning health , daily importuned the lady for her hand , to which there now remained no other equal claimant . But she gave him to understand , that feeling herself singular in misfortune , by having lost in one day three admirers of superior merit , she would not consent to bear to the bridal ceremony a heart consumed by eternal regret ; and that , as a monument of her grief , she intended to compose a lay , the title of which should be “ Les quatre Dols , ” ( the four griefs ) . The lover , instead of attempting to argue her out of this resolution , only employs his eloquence in convincing her that the title of the new lay ought to be “ Le Chaitivel , ” ( the wretch ) , because his rivals had found in death the end of their disappointments , while he was doomed to a life of sorrow and privation . The lady having assented to this change , the story is abruptly brought to a conclusion .</p>
   <p>No . XI .— Translation of the Lai DEE CHEVREFOIL :</p>
   <p>( From Notes to Sir Tristrem , edited by Walter Scott , Esq . )</p>
   <p>I am much pleased with the lay which is called Chevrefoil . Let me relate to you truly on what occasion it was made , and by whom . Many persons have narrated the story to me ; and I have also found it in writing , in the work which treats of Tristrem , and of the Queen ; and of their constant love , from which they suffered a thousand sorrows ; and expired on the same day .<span type="note_anchor">[ 81 ]</span></p>
   <p>King Markes had been much offended with his nephew , Tristrem ; and had banished him on account of his attachment to the queen . The knight retired into the country where he was born ; spent there a whole year of affliction ; and , being still forbidden to return , became careless of life . Do not wonder at this ; for a true lover , where his wishes are crossed by insuperable obstacles , can set no bounds to his grief . Tristrem , therefore , thus driven to despair , left his home ; passed into Cornwall , the abode of the queen , and concealed himself in the thickest part of the forest ; from which he issued only at the close of the day , at which time he took up his lodgings among the peasants and the poorest of mankind . After frequent questions to these his hosts , concerning the public news of the court , he at length learned the king had convoked his barons , and summoned them to attend him at Pentecost , at the castle of Tintagel . Tristrem was rejoiced at this news ; because it was impossible the queen could arrive at the meeting without giving him an opportunity of getting sight of her during the journey . On the appointed day , therefore , be took his station , in that part of the wood through which the road passed , cut down a branch of codre ( hazel ) , smoothed it , wrote his name on it with the point of his knife , together with other characters , which the queen would well know how to decypher . He perceives her approaching ; he sees her examine with attention every object on her road . In former times they had recognized each other by means of a similar device ; and he trusts , that , should she cast her eyes on the stick , she will suspect it to belong to her lover . This was the purport of the characters traced on it : “ That he had long been waiting at a distance , in hopes of being favoured with some expedient which might procure him a meeting , without which he could no longer exist . It was with these two , as with the chevrefoil and the codre . When the honey-suckle has caught hold of the codre , and encircled it by its embraces , the two will live together and flourish ; but if any one resolves to sever them , the codre suddenly dies , and the honey-suckle with it . Sweet friend , so it is with us ; I cannot live without you , nor you without me . ”</p>
   <p>The queen slowly riding on , perceives the stick , and recognizes the well-known characters . She orders the knights who accompany her to stop . She is tired ; she will get off her horse for a short time , and take some repose . She calls to her only her maid , her faithful Brenguein ; quits the road , plunges into the thickest part of the forest , and finds him whom she loved more than all the world . Both were delighted beyond measure at this meeting , which gives them full leisure to concert their future projects . She tells him , that he may now be easily reconciled to his uncle . That the king has often regretted his absence , and attributes to the malicious accusations of their common enemies , the severe measure of his banishment . After a long conversation , the queen tears herself from him ; and they separate with mutual grief . Tristrem returned to South-Wales , from whence he was soon recalled by his uncle ; but , in the mean time , he had repeated to himself , over and over again , every word of his mistress 's late conversation ; and , while full of the joy he felt at having seen her , he composed ( being a perfect master of the lays ) a new lay , describing his stratagem , its success , his delight , and the very words uttered by the queen . I will tell you the name of this lay it is called Goat-leaf in English , and Chevre-foil in French . I have now told you the whole truth .<span type="note_anchor">[ 82 ]</span></p>

     <l n="4">No . XII .— ELIDUC .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>This is stated to be a very old Breton lay . Its original title was “ Guildeluec ha Gualadun , ” from the names of the two heroines ; but it was afterwards more commonly stiled , The Lay of Eliduc .</p>
   <p>Eliduc was a knight of Bretagne , much admired for military prowess , courtesy , and political sagacity ; in consequence of which , his sovereign , who loved and admired him , was in the habit of entrusting to his management the most important cares of government . Indeed , so great was his influence at court , that he enjoyed , almost as completely as the king , the privilege of the chace in the royal forests . But the favour of sovereigns is always precarious ; and so adroit were his enemies , that he was suddenly deprived of all his honours , and even banished the country , without being able to obtain from his once indulgent master , the privilege of knowing his crimes , or being confronted with his accusers . Fortunately he was in the prime of life , fond of adventure , and not of a temper to despond . He retired to his castle , convened his friends , and communicated to them the king 's injustice , and his own projects ; which were , to embark for England , and there enter into the pay of the first king who might want his assistance . But he had a wife , the fair and amiable Guildeluec , whom he tenderly loved ; and whom , as he was unwilling to carry her into exile , he earnestly recommended to their care and attentions . He then selected ten knights as his companions , and departed for the sea-coast , escorted by nearly all his friends and vassals , and accompanied by his wife , who was almost frantic with grief at this cruel separation , and whom he could scarcely reconcile to her fate , by repeating again and again the most solemn assurances of eternal and inviolable fidelity . At length he embarked with a fair wind , and landing at Totness , in Devonshire , proceeded towards Exeter . The king of this district had an only daughter , heiress of his dominions ; and , having refused to bestow her on a neighbouring prince , was at that time involved in a most distressful war , and besieged in his capital . Eliduc went no further : he sent a message to the distressed king , offering his assistance ; and requesting , should the proposal be rejected , a safe conduct through the country . The king most gladly accepted the offer , and ordered his constable to prepare a house for the reception of the welcome guests , and issue a suitable sum of money , with a supply of provisions for their monthly expenditure . Eliduc and his attendants were magnificently entertained . His inn was the house of the richest burgess in the town , and the grand tapestry room<span type="note_anchor">[ 83 ]</span>was surrendered to the knight by its proprietor . Eliduc on his part was equally liberal . He issued strict orders to his attendants , that during the first forty days , none of them should accept either pay or provisions from the court ; and during this time kept , at his own expence , a profuse table for the accommodation of such knights as were unprovided with other means of subsistence . On the third day , an alarm was spread that the enemy had again over-run the country , and might shortly be expected at the gates . Eliduc flew to arms ; and , having assembled his ten knights , was soon after joined by fourteen more from different parts of the city , who declared themselves ready to encounter , under his commands , any inequality of numbers . Eliduc praised their zeal ; but observed , that this intemperate valour was more fitted for the lists of a tournament than for useful service ; and requested that they , who knew the country , would shew him some defile in which he could hope to attack the enemy on equal terms . They pointed out a hollow way in the neighbouring forest , by which the invaders usually passed and returned ; and Eliduc , while hastening there , described the measures he meant to pursue , and exhorted them to follow him with vigour . All was so well planned and executed , that the foe were surprized laden with booty ; and their commander , with thirty principal officers , seized on his palfrey , and made prisoners almost without resistance . The squires and other attendants at the same time secured a large quantity of baggage , and the troop immediately hastened their return towards the city , where their appearance excited no small consternation . The king , having mounted a watch-tower , had descried his small garrison of knights engaged in a distant action with very superior numbers ; after which , seeing a large body in full march for the city , he concluded Eliduc had betrayed him ; caused the gates to be shut , the alarm to be sounded , and commanded the citizens to defend the walls . But being quickly undeceived , he welcomed his deliverer with transports of joy and gratitude ; and , after receiving his oath of allegiance for a year , invested him with the supreme military command , and assigned ample pensions to himself and all his attendants . The king 's daughter , the beautiful Guilliadun , became anxious in her turn to behold the extraordinary stranger , who had confirmed her father in his throne , by means of a troop of knights , who scarcely appeared competent to the defence of the walls . She invited him to an audience , to which he was formally introduced by one of her chamberlains ; seated him near her on a bed ; and entered into conversation on a variety of indifferent topics . But during the discourse , she could not help remarking that this consummate warrior and statesman was young and handsome ; and found her heart completely engaged . After sighing and turning pale , and making many reflections on the indelicacy of avowing her passion , she would probably have done it , if the knight had not , by respectfully taking leave , put an end to the interview . He , in the mean time , had not been blind to her perfections , her youth , beauty , simplicity and frankness of character , and , above all , those artless sighs which assured him of her affection , had made an indelible impression on his heart . At length the image of his wife , and his solemn assurances of fidelity , interrupted the dream of happiness in which he had involuntarily indulged ; but the interruption became painful ; and while he mentally repeated the promise of adhering to duty , he felt that promise disavowed by his inclination . Guilliadun , after a sleepless night , found it impossible to keep her secret , and having summoned a trusty chamberlain , confided to him her sudden , and , as she thought , inexplicable passion . After a long discussion , she at length , at his suggestion , dispatched him to the knight with the usual salutations of courtesy , and with the present of her ring and a rich girdle . Eliduc immediately replied by an equally courteous message ; put the ring on his finger ; bound the girdle round his loins ; offered a rich present to the chamberlain , who declined it ; but avoided all discussion on the subject of his message . The impatient princess was almost driven to despair by the report of her chamberlain , who , though convinced that Eliduc could not be insensible to the kindness of his mistress , was unable to satisfy her mind , or even his own , concerning the cause of such extreme discretion . Both , indeed , were ignorant of the conflicts by which he was agitated . To recall his former fondness for his wife , and to conciliate his duty and affection , was no longer possible : to betray and dishonour the amiable Guilliadun would be infamous ; and to encourage her passion and his own , without being hurried too far , was extremely difficult ; yet on this he ultimately resolved ; and , having mounted his horse , set off for the palace under pretence of paying his court to the king , but with the real view of obtaining an interview with his daughter . The monarch was at that moment in the apartment of the princess , to whom , while be played a game of chess with a foreign knight , he explained the moves . On the entrance of Eliduc he immediately introduced him to her , enjoining her to entertain and form an acquaintance with a knight , who had few equals in merit ; and the young lady , gladly obeying the injunction , retired with her lover to the farther end of the apartment . After a long silence equally painful to both , and which each ineffectually attempted more than once to interrupt , Eliduc luckily bethought himself of returning thanks for the ring and girdle ; which , as he assured her , he valued far beyond all his earthly possessions . This warmth of expression encouraging the princess , she frankly proceeded to make an avowal of her passion , declaring , if he should reject her hand , there was no other man on earth whom she would ever accept as a husband ; and , when he mysteriously replied , that , as far as his wishes were concerned , there could be no bar , but that it was his purpose , after the year of service for which he was pledged to her father , to return and establish himself in his own country , she told him she had full confidence in his honour , and was persuaded , when the time arrived , he would make all proper arrangements for her future destiny . Thus ended the interview to their mutual satisfaction . Eliduc , watchful , enterprizing , and indefatigable , soon recovered for her father all the lost provinces , and insured future tranquillity by the capture of his enemy ; but scarcely was the war concluded , when the knight received an embassy from his former master , whose ingratitude had been punished by the loss of half his kingdom , and the jeopardy of the rest , adjuring him to come with all speed to the rescue of a country which was now purged of the monsters whose false accusations had occasioned his exile . Such an embassy , a few months sooner would have been most welcome , but to part with Guilliadun now appeared the heaviest of misfortunes . He felt , however , that duty called him away , and determined to obey the summons . He went to the king ; read the letters he had received ; and earnestly requested leave to depart , though his stipulated term of service was not expired ; observing , at the same time , that the state of his majesty 's affairs no longer required his attendance ; and , promising at the first appearance of difficulty , he would return with a powerful body of knights . The king , after making the most splendid offers to detain him , unwillingly yielded ; but to obtain the consent of Guilliadun was far more difficult . Trusting that she possessed the whole heart of her lover , and perfectly unconscious that his hand had been previously given to another , she insisted on accompanying him , and threatened to destroy herself in case of his refusal . His remonstrances were accompanied by fainting fits , which terrified Eliduc into a solemn promise of unqualified submission to her will ; but he represented , that having sworn fealty to her father , she could not now go with him , without a breach of his oath ; whereas , after the expiration of his term of service , he could , without disgrace , comply with her wishes ; and he promised , on the honour of a knight , that if she would fix a day , he would return and carry her off . With this promise she was satisfied , and after many tears , and a mutual exchange of rings , ultimately permitted him to depart . The return of Eliduc gave infinite pleasure to his friends , to the king his master , and above all , to his excellent wife , who now hoped she should be indemnified , by his beloved society , for her long and dreary hours of widowhood . But she beheld , with surprise and consternation that he harboured some secret grief , and anxiously enquired if any thing in her conduct had given him displeasure . Eliduc assured her of the contrary , but told her , in apparent confidence , that he was forced by his oath to return to the king whom he had lately quitted , so soon as he should have settled the affairs of his own country ; that he had much to endure , much to accomplish ; and that , harassed as he was on all sides , he should never regain his former gaiety till he should have extricated himself from all his difficulties . In the mean time , his mere name had inspired the enemy with alarm ; his re-appearance at the head of the armies brought back victory to the royal standard ; he saw and seized the moment of making an advantageous peace ; and , having done so , prepared for the execution of a more pleasing enterprise . Taking with him only two nephews , a chamberlain and a trusty squire , all of whom he swore to secresy , he embarked for Loegria ; stationed his vessel at some distance from the harbour of Totness ; and landing his chamberlain alone , and in disguise , sent him , with secret instructions to the princess . The confidant executed his commission with address ; made his way unobserved to the chamber of Guilliadun , informed her of his master 's arrival , and explained the measures he had devised for her escape . They waited for the approach of night ; when Guilliadun , without any other attendant , having muffled herself in a short and warm mantle , which concealed the richness of her usual garments , followed him out of the town , to a small wood , where Eliduc , who had deferred his landing till evening , awaited her . The knight instantly placed her on a horse , springing on another , and taking her rein in his hand , hurried forward to the sea , and embarked without having excited the slightest suspicion of the enterprise , to which none were privy excepting those on board . Both wind and tide were favourable ; they arrived near the coast of Bretagne , and were on the point of entering the harbour , when a sudden squall from the shore split their mast , rent their sail , and exposed them for some hours to the most imminent danger . All exertions to guide the vessel being ineffectual , they had recourse to prayers , invoking St. Nicholas and St. Clement , and requesting the intercession of the blessed Virgin and her Son , that they might be permitted to land in safety . The storm continued ; when one of the sailors suddenly exclaimed , “ Sir knight , you carry with you the cause of our calamity . In defiance of God , religion , justice and honour , you are carrying off that lady , having already a beautiful and lawful wife in your own country . Permit us to throw your paramour into the sea , and we shall speedily find our prayers effectual . ” The princess was then lying , almost exhausted with fatigue , sickness , and fear , in the arms of her lover ; who , though bursting with rage , could only express it by execrations , which he vented as loudly as he could in the hope of drowning the hateful voice of the mariner , but the fatal assurance “ Eliduc was already married , ” had reached the ear , and sunk deeply into the heart of Guilliadun . She fainted , and though he and his friends employed all the means in their power for her recovery , they were unable to produce any symptom of returning animation , a general exclamation of grief pronounced her dead ; when the knight , starting from the body , seized an oar , felled at one blow the presumptuous seaman , threw him by the foot into the sea , took possession of the helm , and directed it so skilfully that the vessel reached the harbour in safety . They all landed , and in a very few hours might reach the castle of Eliduc , which was not far from the coast ; but where could he deposit the body of his mistress , how inter it with all the honours suitable to her rank and merit ? he at length recollected , that in the forest which surrounded his mansion , dwelt an aged hermit , at whose cell the corpse might remain till its interment : he could then enjoy the sad pleasure of visiting daily the object of all his solicitude , and he determined to found on the spot an abbey , in which a number of monks should pray for ever for the soul of the lovely and injured Guilliadun . He then mounted his palfrey , and , carrying the body in his arms , proceeded with his attendants to the hermitage . The door was shut ; and they discovered , after having at length procured an entrance , the grave of the holy man , who had expired a few days before . Eliduc caused a bed to be made within the chapel ; and placing on it his mistress , whose deadly paleness had not yet injured her beauty , burst into a flood of tears , kissed her lips and eyes , as if in the hopes of restoring their animation ; and solemnly pronounced a vow , that from the date of her interment he would never more exercise the functions of a knight ; but , after having erected an abbey on the spot , sanctified by her remains , would assume himself the monastic habit , and daily visit her tomb to express his love , his grief , and his remorse . He then , with difficulty tore himself from the body , and departed ; having first sent a messenger to his castle to announce that he was arrived , but so much fatigued and way-worn , as to require nothing but repose and solitude . His wife met him with her usual gentleness of affection ; but instantly saw in his haggard looks that his heart laboured with some misery which her tenderness was unable to remove . His manners were such as to awaken without satisfying her curiosity . He rose at day break , spent some hours at prayers , walked alone into the forest , proceeded instinctively to the fatal hermitage , and returned late in the evening , bearing with him , as it appeared , an additional load of misery . He saw with astonishment that death seemed to abstain from ravaging the beauties of Guilliadun ; he involuntarily gave way to the most flattering hopes ; and , after many long sad hours of tears and fruitless prayer , retired in anguish and disappointment . On the third day he gave notice he should go to court , and pass the evening with the king . His wife , in the mean time , by the promise of the most tempting rewards , had engaged one of her pages to follow his master at a distance , during his forest walk , and report what he should see and hear ; and the page , having on that morning executed his commission , she determined to take advantage of Eliduc 's absence to visit the hermitage , and discover , if possible , the cause of that excessive grief to which he gave way ; and of which the death of the old hermit , much as he might have loved him , was far from affording a satisfactory explanation . She set forth with the page , entered the chapel , beheld , with much surprize , a bed handsomely ornamented ; and , on lifting up the covering , saw , with still more astonishment , the young and blooming Guilliadun , “ qui resemblot rose nuvele . ” The faultless beauty of a living rival might have excited some indignation in the bosom of the most patient wife , but the eyes of the lovely object before her , appeared closed for ever ; and Guildeluec could find no place in her heart , for any sentiments but those of admiration and pity . After calling her page to survey the spectacle which fully explained and excused her husband 's immoderate grief , she sat down by the bed to reflect on the past , and decide on her own future conduct . During , the long absence of Eliduc she had devoted the greater part of her time to religious exercises , and now clearly saw that to them only could she look for comfort . Having convinced herself of this necessity , she turned , with tears in her eyes , to the fair object of her husband 's regret ; when a circumstance , apparently trifling , involuntarily arrested her attention . A weasel , creeping from under the altar , ran upon the bed , and passing several times over the face of the entranced Guilliadun , so far incensed the page , that with a blow of his stick he laid it dead at his feet , and then threw it on the floor . The animal had lain there only a few moments , when another weasel , coming from the same hole , ran up , and attempted awhile to sport with it , and then , after exhibiting every appearance of grief , suddenly ran off into the wood , and returned with a flower of a beautiful vermilion colour , which it carefully inserted into the mouth of the dead animal . The effect was sudden , the weasel instantaneously got upon its legs , and was preparing to escape ; when the lady exclaimed to the page , to strike it again , and he aimed a second blow , that caused the creature to drop the flower , which Guildeluec instantly seized , and carefully placed between the lips of Guilliadun . The plant had not lost its efficacy . The princess , awakening from her trance , expressed her surprise at having slept so long , and then gazed with astonishment at the bed on which she lay , at the walls of the chapel by which she was surrounded , and at the two unknown figures , of Guildeluec and the page ; who , kneeling by her side , loudly expressed their thanksgiving to the Almighty for what they thought her miraculous resurrection . At length the good lady , having finished her devotions , began to question the fair stranger respecting her birth and preceding adventures , which she related with the utmost candour and exactness , till the fatal moment when the discovery of Eliduc 's prior marriage had deprived her of sense and motion . The rest was better known to her hearers than herself ; and Guildeluec , more and more charmed with her innocence , and frankness , after avowing herself , lost no time in comforting her , by the assurance that all her hopes and wishes might now be speedily gratified . “ Your youthful beauty , ” said she , “ might captivate any heart , and your merit will fix for ever that of Eliduc , who is unalterably attached to you , and whose grief for your loss was such as to preclude all hopes of consolation . It is my intention to take the veil , and abandon all claim to those affections which are estranged from me for ever . In restoring you to the now wretched Eliduc , I shall promote , by the only means in my power , that happiness to which I have hitherto been the unintentional obstacle . ” Guilliadun consented , with silent gratitude , to accept the sacrifice so generously offered , and was united to her lover as soon as the solemn ceremony had taken place , by which Guildeluec consecrated the remainder of her days to heaven , in a nunnery erected and endowed by her husband , on the site of the ancient hermitage . Their union was followed by many years of happiness ; and they closed a life of charity and benevolence by following the pious example of Guildeluec , who received Guilliadun into her order , while Eliduc took the cowl in a monastery , to the endowment of which he dedicated the remainder of his worldly possessions . From the adventure of these three , “ the olde gentil Bretons ” ( li auncien Bretun curteis ) formed a lay to transmit to future ages .</p>
