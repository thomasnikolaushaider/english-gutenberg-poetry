     <p>THOMAS HOOD . ] BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION .</p>
    </figure>
    <docTitle><titlePart>There were scarcely any events in the life of Thomas Hood . One condition there was of too potent determining importance — life-long ill health ; and one circumstance of moment — a commercial failure , and consequent expatriation . Beyond this , little presents itself for record in the outward facts of this upright and beneficial career , bright with genius and coruscating with wit , dark with the lengthening and deepening shadow of death . The father of Thomas Hood was engaged in business as a publisher and bookseller in the Poultry , in the city of London ,— a member of the firm of Vernor , Hood , and Sharpe . He was a Scotchman , and had come up to the capital early in life , to make his way . His interest in books was not solely confined to their saleable quality . He reprinted various old works with success ; published Bloomfield 's poems , and dealt handsomely with him ; and was himself the author of two novels , which are stated to have had some success in their day . For the sake of the son rather than the father , one would like to see some account , with adequate specimens , of these long-forgotten tales ; for the queries which Thomas Hood asks concerning the piteous woman of his Bridge of Sighs interest us all concerning a man of genius , and interest us moreover with regard to the question of intellectual as well as natural affinity :— “ Who was his father , Who was his mother ? Had he a sister , Had he a brother ? ” Another line of work in which the elder Hood is recorded to have been active was the opening of the English book-trade with America . He married a sister of the engraver Mr. Sands , and had by her a large family ; two sons and four daughters survived the period of childhood . The elder brother , James , who died early of consumption , drew well , as did also one or two of the sisters . It would seem therefore , when we recall Thomas Hood 's aptitudes and frequent miscellaneous practice in the same line , that a certain tendency towards fine art , as well as towards literature , ran in the family . The consumption which killed James appears to have been inherited from his mother ; she , and two of her daughters , died of the same disease ; and a pulmonary affection of a somewhat different kind became , as we shall see , one of the poet 's most inveterate persecutors . The death of the father , which was sudden and unexpected , preceded that of the mother , but not of James , and left the survivors in rather straitened circumstances .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>Thomas , the second of the two sons , was born in the Poultry , on or about the 23d of May ,<date>1799</date>. He is stated to have been a retired child , with much quiet humor ; chuckling , we may guess , over his own quaint imaginings , which must have come in crowds , and of all conceivable or inconceivable sorts , to judge from the products of his after years ; keeping most of these fancies and surprises to himself , but every now and then letting some of them out , and giving homely or stolid bystanders an inkling of insight into the many-peopled crannies of his boyish brain . He received his education at Dr. Wanostrocht 's school at Clapham . It is not very clear how far this education extended :[ 1 ] I should infer that it was just about enough , and not more than enough , to enable Hood to shift for himself in the career of authorship , without serious disadvantage from inadequate early training , and also without much aid thence derived — without , at any rate , any such rousing and refining of the literary sense as would warrant us in attributing to educational influences either the inclination to become an author , or the manipulative power over language and style which Hood displayed in his serious poems , not to speak of those of a lighter kind . We seem to see him sliding , as it were , into the profession of letters , simply through capacity and liking , and the course of events — not because he had resolutely made up his mind to be an author , nor because his natural faculty had been steadily or studiously cultivated . As to details , it may be remarked that his schooling included some amount — perhaps a fair average amount — of Latin . We find it stated that he had a Latin prize at school , but was not apt at the language in later years . He had however one kind of aptitude at it — being addicted to the use of familiar Latin quotations or phrases , cited with humorous verbal perversions . [ Footnote 1 : The authority — I might almost say , the one authority — for the life of Hood , is the Memorials published by his son and daughter . Any point which is not clearly brought out in that affectionate and interesting record will naturally be equally or more indefinite in my brief summary , founded as it is on the Memorials . ]</docImprint>

  <body>
   <p>In all the relations of family life , and the forms of family affection , Hood was simply exemplary . The deaths of his elder brother and of his father left him the principal reliance of his mother , herself destined soon to follow them to the tomb : he was an excellent and devoted son . His affection for one of his sisters , Anne , who also died shortly afterwards , is attested in the beautiful lines named The Deathbed ,—</p>
   <p>“ We watched her breathing through the night . ”</p>
   <p>At a later date , the loves of a husband and a father seem to have absorbed by far the greater part of his nature and his thoughts : his letters to friends are steeped and drenched In “ Jane , ” “ Fanny , ” and “ Tom junior . ” These letters are mostly divided between perpetual family details and perennial jocularity : a succession of witticisms , or at lowest of puns and whimsicalities , mounts up like so many squibs and crackers , fizzing through , sparkling amid , or ultimately extinguished by , the inevitable shower — the steady rush and downpour — of the home-affections . It may easily be inferred from this account that there are letters which one is inclined to read more thoroughly , and in greater number consecutively , than Hood 's .</p>
   <p>The vocation first selected for Hood , towards the age of fifteen , was one which he did not follow up for long — that of an engraver . He was apprenticed to his uncle Mr. Sands , and afterwards to one of the Le Keux family . The occupation was ill-suited to his constantly ailing health , and this eventually conduced to his abandoning it . He then went to Scotland to recruit , remaining there among his relatives about five years .<span corresp="#note2" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>According to a statement made by himself , he was in a merchant 's office within this interval ; it is uncertain , however , whether this assertion is to be accepted as genuine , or as made for some purpose of fun . His first published writing appeared in the Dundee Advertiser in 1814 — his age being then , at the utmost , fifteen and a half ; this was succeeded by some contribution to a local magazine . But as yet he had no idea of authorship as a profession .</p>
   <note xml:id="note2" place="bottom" n="2">“ Two years , ” according to the Memorials ; but the dates for this portion of Hood 's life are not accurately given in that work . Hood completed the fifteenth year of his age in May , 1814 . It is certain , from the dates of his letters , that his sojourn in Scotland began not later than September , 1815 ; and the writer of the Memorials himself affirms that Hood “ returned to London about 1820 , ” in or before July . If so , he was in Scotland about five years ; and , from the fact that he had written in a Dundee newspaper in 1814 , one might even surmise that the term of six years was nearer the mark . At any rate , as he had reached Scotland by September , 1815 , he was there soon after completing his sixteenth year : yet Mr. Hessey ( Memorials , p. 23 ) says that he was articled to the engraving business “ at the age of fifteen or sixteen , ” and his apprenticeship , according to Mr . Hood , junior , lasted “ some years ” even before his transfer from Mr. Sands to Mr . Le Keux . The apprenticeship did not begin until after the father 's death ; but the year of that death is left unspecified , though the day and month are given . These dates , as the reader will readily perceive , are sometimes vague , and sometimes contradictory . In the text of my notice , I have endeavored to pick my way through their discrepancies .</note>
   <p>Towards the middle of the year 1820 , Hood was re-settled in London , improved in health , and just come of age . At first he continued practising as an engraver ; but in 1821 he began to act as a sort of sub-editor for the London Magazine after the death of the editor , Mr. Scott , in a duel . He concocted fictitious and humorous answers to correspondents — a humble yet appropriate introduction to the insatiable habit and faculty for out-of-the-way verbal jocosity which marked-off his after career from that of all other excellent poets .</p>
   <p>His first regular contribution to the magazine , in July , 1821 , was a little poem To Hope : even before this , as early at any rate as 1815 , he was in the frequent practice of writing correctly and at some length in verse , as witnessed by selections , now in print , from what he had composed for the amusement of his relatives . Soon afterwards , a private literary society was the recipient of other verses of the same order . The lines To Hope were followed , in the London Magazine , by the Ode to Dr. Kitchener and some further poems , including the important work , Lycus the Centaur — after the publication of which , there could not be much doubt of the genuine and uncommon powers of the new writer . The last contribution of Hood to this magazine was the Lines to a Cold Beauty . Another early work of his , and one which , like the verses To the Moon , affords marked evidence of the impression which he had received from Keats 's poetry , is the unfinished drama ( or , as he termed it , “ romance ” ) of Lamia : I do not find its precise date recorded . Its verse is lax , and its tone somewhat immature ; yet it shows a great deal of sparkling and diversified talent . Hood certainly takes a rather more rational view than Keats did of his subject as a moral invention , or a myth having some sort of meaning at its root . A serpent transformed into a woman , who beguiles a youth of the highest hopes into amorous languid self-abandonment , is clearly not , in morals , the sort of person that ought to be left uncontrolled to her own devices . Keats ostentatiously resents the action of the unimpassioned philosopher Appollonius in revealing the true nature of the woman-serpent , and dissolving her spell . An elderly pedant to interfere with the pretty whims of a viper when she wears the outer semblance of a fine woman ! Intolerable !</p>
   <p>( Such is the sentiment of Keats ; but such plainly is not altogether the conviction of Hood , although his story remains but partially developed . )</p>
   <p>By this time it may have become pretty clear to himself and others that his proper vocation and destined profession was literature . Through the London Magazine , he got to know John Hamilton Reynolds ( author of the Garden of Florence and other poems , and a contributor to this serial under the pseudonym of Edward Herbert ) , Charles Lamb , Allan Cunningham , De Quincey , and other writers of reputation . To Hood the most directly important of all these acquaintances was Mr. Reynolds ; this gentleman having a sister , Jane , to whom Hood was introduced . An attachment ensued , and shortly terminated in marriage , the wedding taking place on the 5th of May , 1824 . The father of Miss Reynolds was the head writing-master at Christ Hospital . She is stated to have had good manners , a cultivated mind , and literary tastes , though a high educational standard is not always traceable in her letters . At any rate the marriage was a happy one ; Mrs . Hood being a tender and attentive wife , unwearied in the cares which her husband 's precarious health demanded , and he being ( as I have said ) a mirror of marital constancy and devotion , distinguishable from a lover rather by his intense delight in all domestic relations and details than by any cooling-down in his fondness . It would appear that , in the later years of Hood 's life , he was not on entirely good terms with some members of his wife 's family , including his old friend John Hamilton Reynolds . What may have caused this I do not find specified : all that we know of the character of Hood justifies us in thinking that he was little or not at all to blame , for he appears throughout a man of just , honorable , and loving nature , and free besides from that sort of self-assertion which invites a collision . Every one , however , has his blemishes ; and we may perhaps discern in Hood a certain over-readiness to think himself imposed upon , and the fellow-creatures with whom he had immediately to do a generation of vipers — a state of feeling not characteristic of a mind exalted and magnanimous by habit , or “ gentle ” in the older and more significant meaning of the term .</p>
   <p>The time was now come for Hood to venture a volume upon the world . Conjointly with Reynolds , he wrote , and published in 1825 , his Odes and Addresses to Great People . The title-page bore no author 's name ; but the extraordinary talent and point of the work could hardly fail to be noticed , even apart from its appeal to immediate popularity , dealing as it did so continually with the uppermost topics of the day . It had what it deserved , a great success . This volume was followed , in 1826 , by the first series of Whims and Oddities , which also met with a good sale ; the second series appeared in 1827 . Next came two volumes of National Tales , somewhat after the manner of Boccaccio ( but how far different from his spirit may easily be surmised ) , which are now little known . The volume containing the Plea of the Midsummer Fairies , Hero and Leander , and some other of Hood 's most finished and noticeable poems , came out in 1827 . The Midsummer Fairies itself was one of the authors own favorite works , and certainly deserved to be so , as far as dainty elegance of motive and of execution is concerned : but the conception was a little too ingeniously remote for the public to ratify the author 's predilection . The Hero and Leander will be at once recognized as modelled on the style of Elizabethan narrative poems : indeed Marlow treated the very same subject , and his poem , left uncompleted , was finished by Chapman . Hood 's is a most astonishing example of revivalist poetry : it is reproductive and spontaneous at the same time . It resembles its models closely , not servilely — significantly , not mechanically ; and has the great merit of resembling them with comparative moderation . Elizabethan here both in spirit and in letter , Hood is nevertheless a little less extreme than his prototypes . Where they loaded , he does not find it needful to overload , which is the ready and almost the inevitable resource of revivalists , all but the fewest : on the contrary , he alleviates a little ,— but only a little .</p>
   <p>In 1829 appeared the most famous of all his poems of a narrative character — The Dream of Eugene Aram ; it was published in the Gem , an annual which the poet was then editing . Besides this amount of literary activity , Hood continued writing in periodicals , sometimes under the signature of “ Theodore M . ”</p>
   <p>His excessive and immeasurable addiction to rollicking fun , to the perpetual “ cracking of jokes ” ( for it amounts to that more definitely than to anything else in the domain of the Comic Muse ) , is a somewhat curious problem , taken in connection with his remarkable genius and accomplishment as a poet , and his personal character as a solid housekeeping citizen , bent chiefly upon rearing his family in respectability , and paying his way , or , as the Church Catechism has neatly and unimprovably expressed it , upon “ doing his duty in that state of life to which it had pleased God to call him . ” His almost constant ill-health , and , in a minor degree , the troubles which beset him in money-matters , make the problem all the more noticeable . The influence of Charles Lamb may have had something to do with it ,— probably not very much . Perhaps there was something in the literary atmosphere or the national tone of the time which gave comicality a turn of predominance after the subsiding of the great poetic wave which filled the last years of the eighteenth and the first quarter of the nineteenth century in our country , in Blake , Burns , Wordsworth , Scott , Coleridge , Landor , Byron , Keats , and , supreme among all , Shelley . Something of the same transition may be noticed in the art of design ; the multifarious illustrator in the prior generation is Stothard ,— in the later , Cruikshank . At any rate , in literature , Lamb , Hood , and then Dickens in his earliest works , the Sketches by Boz and Pickwick , are uncommonly characteristic and leading minds , and bent , with singular inveteracy , upon being “ funny , ” — though not funny and nothing else at all . But we should not force this consideration too far : Hood is a central figure in the group and the period , and the tendency of the time may be almost as much due to him as he to the tendency . Mainly , we have to fall back upon his own idiosyncrasy : he was born with a boundlessly whimsical perception , which he trained into an inimitable sleight-of-hand in the twisting of notions and of words ; circumstances favored his writing for fugitive publications and skimming readers , rather than under conditions of greater permanency ; and the result is as we find it in his works . His son expresses the opinion that part of Hood 's success in comic writing arose from his early reading of Humphrey Clinker , Tristram Shandy , Tom Jones , and other works of that period , and imbuing himself with their style : a remark , however , which applies to his prose rather than his poetical works . Certain it is that the appetite for all kinds of fun , verbal and other was a part of Hood 's nature . We see it in the practical jokes he was continually playing on his good-humored wife — such as altering into grotesque absurdity many of the words contained in her letters to friends : we see it — the mere animal love of jocularity , as it might be termed — in such a small point as his frequently addressing his friend Philip de Franck , in letters , by the words , “ Tim , says he , ” instead of any human appellative<span corresp="#note3" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>Hood reminds us very much of one of Shakespeare 's Fools ( to use the word in no invidious sense ) transported into the nineteenth century ,— the Fool in King Lear , or Touchstone . For the occasional sallies of coarseness or ribaldry , the spirit of the time has substituted a bourgeois good-humor which respects the family circle , and haunts the kitchen-stairs ; for the biting jeer , intended to make some victim uncomfortable , it gives the sarcastic or sprightly banter , not unconscious of an effort at moral amelioration ; for the sententious sagacity , and humorous enjoyment of the nature of man , it gives bright thoughts and a humanitarian sympathy . But , on the whole , the intellectual personality is nearly the same : seeking by natural affinity , and enjoying to the uttermost , whatever tends to lightness of heart and to ridicule — thus dwelling indeed in the region of the commonplace and the gross , but constantly informing it with some suggestion of poetry , somewise side-meaning , or some form of sweetness and grace . These observations relate of course to Hood 's humorous poems : into his grave and pathetic poems he can import qualities still loftier than these — though even here it is not often that he utterly forswears quaintness and oddity . The risible , the fantastic , was his beacon-light ; sometimes as delicate as a dell of glow-worms ; sometimes as uproarious as a bonfire ; sometimes , it must be said ( for he had to be perpetually writing whether the inspiration came or not , or his inspiration was too liable to come from the very platitudes and pettinesses of everyday life ) , not much more brilliant than a rush-light , and hardly more aromatic than the snuff of a tallow candle .</p>
   <note xml:id="note3" place="bottom" n="3">This “ Tim , says he , ” is a perfect gag in many of Hood 's letters . It is curious to learn what was the kind of joke which could assume so powerful an ascendant over the mind and associations of this great humorist . Here it is , as given in the Hood Memorials from Sir Jonah Barrington 's Memoirs :—</note>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ ‘ Tim , ’ says he —</l>
     <l n="2">‘ Sir , ’ says he —</l>
     <l n="3">‘ Fetch me my hat , says he ;</l>
     <l n="4">‘ That I may go , ’ says he ,</l>
     <l n="5">‘ To Timahoe , ’ says he ,</l>
     <l n="6">‘ And go to the fair , ’ says he ,</l>
     <l n="7">‘ And see all that 's there , ’ says he .—</l>
     <l n="8">‘ First pay what you owe , ’ says he ;</l>
     <l n="9">‘ And then you may go , ’ says he ,</l>
     <l n="10">‘ To Timahoe , ’ says he ,</l>
     <l n="11">‘ And go to the fair , ’ says he ,</l>
     <l n="12">‘ And see all that 's there , ’ says he .—</l>
     <l n="13">‘ Now by this and by that , ’ says he ,</l>
     <l n="14">‘ Tim , hang up my hat , ’ says he . ” ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>We must now glance again at Hood 's domestic affairs . His first child had no mundane existence worth calling such ; but has nevertheless lived longer than most human beings in the lines which Lamb wrote for the occasion , On an Infant dying as soon as born . A daughter followed , and in 1830 was born his son , the Tom Hood who became editor of the comic journal Fun , and died in 1874 . At the time of his birth , the family was living at Winchmore Hill : thence they removed about 1832 , to the Lake House , Wanstead , a highly picturesque dwelling , but scanty in domestic comforts . The first of the Comic Annual series was brought out at Christmas , 1830 . In the following couple of years , Hood did some theatrical work ; writing the libretto for an English opera which ( it is believed ) was performed at the Surrey Theatre . Its name is now unknown , but it had a good run in its day ; a similar fate has befallen an entertainment which he wrote for Mathews . He also composed a pantomime for the Adelphi ; and , along with Reynolds , dramatized Gil Blas . This play is understood to have been acted at Drury Lane . The novel of Tylney Hall , and the poem of the Epping Hunt , were written at Wanstead .</p>
   <p>Born in comfortable mediocrity , and early inured to narrow fortunes , Hood had no doubt entered upon the literary calling without expecting or caring to become rich . Hitherto , however , he seems to have prospered progressively , and to have had no reason to regret , even in a wordly sense , his choice of a profession . But towards the end of 1834 a disaster overtook him ; and thenceforth , to the end of his days , he had nothing but tedious struggling and uphill work . To a man of his buoyant temperament , and happy in his home , this might have been of no extreme consequence , if only sound health had blessed him : unfortunately , the very reverse was the case . Sickly hitherto , he was soon to become miserably and hopelessly diseased : he worked on through everything bravely and uncomplainingly , but no doubt with keen throbs of discomfort , and not without detriment at times to the quality of his writings . The disaster adverted to was the failure of a firm with which Hood was connected , entailing severe loss upon him . With his accustomed probity , he refused to avail himself of any legal immunities , and resolved to meet his engagements in full eventually ; but it became requisite that he should withdraw from England . He proposed to settle down in some one of the towns on the Rhine , and circumstances fixed his choice on Coblentz . A great storm which overtook him during the passage to Rotterdam told damagingly on his already feeble health . Coblentz , which he reached in March , 1835 , pleased him at first ; though it was not long before he found himself a good deal of an Englishman , and his surroundings vexatiously German . After a while he came to consider a German Jew and a Jew German nearly convertible terms ; and indulged at times in considerable acrimony of comment , such as a reader of cosmopolitan temper is not inclined to approve . He had , however , at least one very agreeable acquaintance at Coblentz — Lieutenant Philip de Franck , an officer in the Prussian service , of partly English parentage : the good-fellowship which he kept up with this amiable gentleman , both in personal intercourse and by letter , was ( as we have seen ) even boyishly vivacious and exuberant . In the first instance Hood lived at No . 372 Castor Hof , where his family joined him in the Spring of 1835 : about a year later , they removed to No . 752 Alten Graben .</p>
   <p>Spasms in the chest now began to be a trying and alarming symptom of his ill-health , which , towards the end of 1836 , took a turn for the worse ; he never afterwards rallied very effectually , though the fluctuations were numerous — ( in November , 1838 , for instance , he fancied that a radical improvement had suddenly taken place ) — and at times the danger was imminent . The unfavorable change in question was nearly simultaneous with a visit which he made to Berlin , accompanying Lieutenant de Franck and his regiment , on their transfer to Bromberg : the rate of travelling was from fifteen to twenty English miles per diem , for three days consecutively , and then one day of rest . Hood liked the simple unextortionate Saxon folk whom he encountered on the route , and contrasted them with the Coblentzers , much to the disadvantage of the latter . By the beginning of December he was back in his Rhineland home ; but finally quitted it towards May , 1837 . Several attacks of blood-spitting occurred in the interval ; at one time Hood proposed for himself the deadly-lively epitaph , “ Here lies one who spat more blood and made more puns than any other man . ”</p>
   <p>About this time he was engaged in writing Up the Rhine ; performing , as was his wont , the greater part of the work during the night-hours . The sojourn at Coblentz was succeeded by a sojourn at Ostend ; in which city — besides the sea , which Hood always supremely delighted in — he found at first more comfort in the ordinary mode of living , including the general readiness at speaking or understanding English . Gradually , however , the climate , extremely damp and often cold , proved highly unsuitable to him ; and , when he quitted Ostend in the Spring of 1840 , at the close of nearly three years ’ residence there , it was apparent that his stay had already lasted too long . Within this period the publication of Hood 's Own had occurred , and put to a severe trial even his unrivalled fertility in jest : one of his letters speaks of the difficulty of being perfectly original in the jocose vein , more especially with reference to the concurrent demands of Hood 's Own , and of the Comic Annual of the year . At the beginning of 1839 he paid a visit of about three weeks to his often-regretted England , staying with one of his oldest and most intimate friends , Mr. Dilke , then editor of the Athenæum . Another of his best friends — one indeed who continued to the end roost unwearied and affectionate in his professional and other attentions , Dr. Elliot — now made a medical examination of Hood 's condition . He pronounced the lungs to be organically sound ; the chief seat of disease being the liver , and the heart , which was placed lower down than usual . At a later stage of the disease , enlargement of the heart is mentioned , along with hæmorrhage from the lungs consequent on that malady , and recurring with terrible frequency : to these dropsy , arising from extreme weakness , was eventually superadded . Indeed , the catalogue of the illnesses of the unconquerably hilarious Hood , and the details of his sufferings , are painful to read . They have at least the merit of giving a touch of adventitious but intimate pathos even to some of his wildest extravagances of verbal fence ,— and of enhancing our sympathy and admiration for the force and beauty of his personal character , which could produce work such as this out of a torture of body and spirit such as that . During this visit to London , Hood scrutinized his publishing and other accounts , and found them sufficiently encouraging . The first edition of Up the Rhine , consisting of 1500 copies , sold off In a fortnight . Soon , however , some vexations with publishers ensued : Hood felt it requisite to take legal proceedings , and the action lingered on throughout and beyond the brief remainder of his life . Thus his prospects were again blighted , and his means crippled when most they needed to be unembarrassed .</p>
   <p>The poet was back in England from Ostend in April 1840 ; and , under medical advice , he determined to prolong his visit into a permanent re-settlement in his native London . Here therefore he remained and returned , no more to the Continent . He took a house , with his family , in Camberwell , not far from the Green ; removing afterwards to St. John 's Wood , and finally to another house in the same district , Devonshire Lodge , Finchley Road . He wrote in the New Monthly Magazine , then edited by Theodore Hook : his Rhymes for the Times , the celebrated Miss Kilmansegg , and other compositions , first appeared here . Hook dying in August 1841 , Hood was invited to succeed him as editor , and closed with the offer : this gave him an annual salary of £ 300 , besides the separate payments for any articles that he wrote . The Song of the Shirt , which it would be futile to praise or even to characterize , came out , anonymously of course , in the Christmas number of Punch for 1843 : it ran like wildfire , and rang like a tocsin , through the land . Immediately afterwards , in January 1844 , Hood 's connection with the New Monthly closed , and he started a publication of his own , Hood 's Magazine , which was a considerable success : more than half the first number was the actual handiwork of the editor . Many troubles and cross-purposes , however , beset the new periodical ; difficulties with which Hood was ill fitted , by his now rapidly and fatally worsening health , to cope . They pestered him when he was most in need of rest ; and he was in need of rest when most he was wanted to control the enterprise . The Haunted House , and various other excellent poems by Hood , were published in this magazine .</p>
   <p>His last days and final agonies were a little cheered by the granting of a Government pension of £ 100 , dating from June 1844 , which , with kindly but ominous foresight , was conferred upon Mrs . Hood , as likely to prove the survivor . This was during the ministry of Sir Robert Peel , whose courteous communications to the poet , and expressions of direct personal interest in his writings , made the boon all the more acceptable . Hood , indeed , had not been directly concerned in soliciting it . At a somewhat earlier date , January 1841 , the Literary Society had , similarly unasked , voted him a sum of £ 50 ; but this he returned , although his circumstances were such as might have made it by no means unwelcome . From Christmas 1844 he was compelled to take to his bed , and was fated never to leave his room again . The ensuing Spring , throughout which the poet lay seemingly almost at the last gasp day by day , was a lovely one . At times he was delirious ; but mostly quite clear in mind , and full of gentleness and resignation . “ Dying , dying , ” were his last words ; and shortly before , “ Lord , say ‘ Arise , take up thy cross , and follow me . ’ ” On the 3d of May 1845 he lay dead .</p>
   <p>Hood 's funeral took place in Kensal Green Cemetery : it was a quiet one , but many friends attended . His faithful and loving wife would not be long divided from him . Eighteen months later she was laid beside him , dying of an illness first contracted from her constant tendance on his sick-bed . In the closing period of his life , Hood could hardly bear her being out of his sight , or even write when she was away . Some years afterwards , a public subscription was got up , and a monument erected to mark the grave of the good man and true poet who “ sang the Song of the Shirt . ”</p>
   <p>The face of Hood is best known by two busts and an oil-portrait which have both been engraved from . It is a sort of face to which apparently a bust does more than justice , yet less than right . The features , being mostly by no means bad ones , look better , when thus reduced to the mere simple and abstract contour , than they probably showed in reality , for no one supposed Hood to be a fine-looking man ; on the other hand , the value of the face must have been in its shifting expression — keen , playful , or subtle — and this can be but barely suggested by the sculptor . The poet 's visage was pallid , his figure slight , his voice feeble ; he always dressed in black , and is spoken of as presenting a generally clerical aspect . He was remarkably deficient in ear for music — not certainly for the true chime and varied resources of verse . His aptitude for the art of design was probably greater than might be inferred from the many comic woodcut-drawings which he has left . These are irresistibly ludicrous — ( who would not laugh over “ The Spoiled Child ” — “ What next ? as the Frog said when his tail fell off ” — and a host of others ? ) — and all the more ludicrous and effective for being drawn more childishly and less artistically than was within Hood 's compass . One may occasionally see some water-color landscape-bit or the like from his hands pleasantly done ; and during his final residence in England he acted upon an idea he had long entertained , and produced some little in the way of oil-painting . He was also ingenious in any sort of light fancy-work — such , for instance , as carving the scenery for a child 's theatre which formed the delight of his little son and daughter . His religious faith was , according to the writers of the Memorials , deep and sincere , though his opposition to sectarian narrowness and spite of all sorts was vigorous , and caused him sometimes to be regarded as anti-religious . A letter of his to a tract-giving and piously censorious lady who had troubled him ( published in the same book ) is absolutely fierce , and indeed hardly to be reconciled with the courtesy due to a woman , as a mere question of sex . It would be convenient , I may observe , to know more plainly what the biographers mean by such expressions as “ religious faith , ” “ Christian gentleman , ” and the like . They are not explained , for instance , by adding that Hood honored the Bible too much to make it a task-book for his children . “ Religious faith ” covers many very serious differences of sentiment and conviction , between natural theology and historical Christianity ; and , on hearing that a man possessed religious faith , one would like to learn which of the two extremes this faith was more nearly conversant with . In respect of political or social opinion , Hood appears to have been rather humane and philanthropic than democratic , or “ liberal ” in the distinct technical sense . His favorite theory of government , as he said in a letter to Peel , was “ an angel from heaven , and a despotism . ” He loved neither whigs nor tories , but was on the side of a national policy : war was his abhorrence , and so were the wicked corn-laws — an oligarchical device which survived him , but not for long . His private generosity , not the less true or hearty for the limits which a precarious and very moderate income necessarily imposed on it , was in accordance with the general sentiments of kindness which he was wont to express both in public and private : if he preached , he did not forget to practise .</p>
   <p>It has been well said<span corresp="#note4" type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>that “ the predominant characteristics of his genius are humorous fancies grafted upon melancholy impressions . ” Yet the term “ grafted ” seems hardly strong enough . Hood appears , by natural bent and permanent habit of mind , to have seen and sought for ludicrousness under all conditions — it was the first thing that struck him as a matter of intellectual perception or choice . On the other hand , his nature being poetic , his sympathies acute , and the condition of his life morbid , he very frequently wrote in a tone of deep and indeed melancholy feeling , and was a master both of his own art and of the reader 's emotion ; but , even in work of this sort , the intellectual execration , when it takes precedence of the general feeling , is continually fantastic , grotesque , or positively mirthful . And so again with those of his works — including rude designs along with finished or off-hand writing — which are professedly comical : the funny twist of thought is the essential thing , and the most gloomy or horrible subject-matter is often selected as the occasion for the horse-laugh . In some of his works indeed ( we might cite the poems named The Dead Robbery , The Forge , and The Supper Superstition ) the horse-laugh almost passes into a nightmare laugh . A ghoul might seem to have set it going , and laughing hyenas to be chorusing it . A man of such a faculty and such a habit of work could scarcely , in all instances , keep himself within the bounds of good taste — a term which people are far too ready to introduce into serious discussions , for the purpose of casting disparagement upon some work which transcends the ordinary standards of appreciation , but a term nevertheless which has its important meaning and its true place . Hood is too often like a man grinning awry , or interlarding serious and beautiful discourse with a nod , a wink , or a leer , neither requisite nor convenient as auxiliaries to his speech : and to do either of these things is to fail in perfect taste . Sometimes , not very often , we are allowed to reach the close of a poem of his without having our attention jogged and called off by a single interpolation of this kind ; and then we feel unalloyed — what we constantly feel also even under the contrary conditions — how exquisite a poetic sense and how choice a cunning of hand were his . On the whole , we can pronounce Hood the finest English poet between the generation of Shelley and the generation of Tennyson .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Summer is gone on swallows ’ wings ,</l>

     <l n="3">No more the lark ,— the linnet — sings ,</l>

     <l n="7">There is in woods a solemn sound</l>
     <l n="8">Of hollow warnings whisper 'd round ,</l>
     <l n="9">As Echo in her deep recess</l>
     <l n="10">For once had turn 'd a prophetess .</l>

    <head>LYCUS THE CENTAUR .</head>
    <head>FROM AN UNROLLED MANUSCRIPT OF APOLLONIUS CURIUS .</head>
    <head>THE ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>Lycus , detained by Circe in her magical dominion , is beloved by a Water Nymph , who , desiring to render him immortal , has recourse to the Sorceress . Circe gives her an incantation to pronounce , which should turn Lycus into a horse ; but the horrible effect of the charm causing her to break off in the midst , he becomes a Centaur .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Who hath ever been lured and bound by a spell</l>

     <l n="3">Where Witchery works with her will like a god ,</l>
     <l n="4">Works more than the wonders of time at a nod ,—</l>
     <l n="5">At a word ,— at a touch ,— at a flash of the eye ,</l>
     <l n="6">But each form is a cheat , and each sound is a lie ,</l>
     <l n="7">Things born of a wish — to endure for a thought ,</l>
     <l n="8">Or last for long ages — to vanish to nought ,</l>
     <l n="9">Or put on new semblance ? O Jove , I had given</l>
     <l n="10">The throne of a kingdom to know if that heaven ,</l>
     <l n="11">And the earth and its streams were of Circe , or whether</l>
     <l n="12">They kept the world 's birthday and brighten 'd together !</l>
     <l n="13">For I loved them in terror , and constantly dreaded</l>
     <l n="14">That the earth where I trod , and the cave where I bedded ,</l>
     <l n="15">The face I might dote on , should live out the lease</l>
     <l n="16">Of the charm that created , and suddenly cease :</l>
     <l n="17">And I gave me to slumber , as if from one dream</l>
     <l n="18">To another — each horrid ,— and drank of the stream</l>
     <l n="19">Like a first taste of blood , lest as water I quaff 'd</l>
     <l n="20">Swift poison , and never should breathe from the draught ,—</l>
     <l n="21">Such drink as her own monarch husband drain 'd up</l>
     <l n="22">When he pledged her , and Fate closed his eyes in the cup .</l>
     <l n="23">And I pluck 'd of the fruit with held breath , and a fear</l>
     <l n="24">That the branch would start back and scream out in my ear ;</l>
     <l n="25">For once , at my suppering , I plucked in the dusk</l>
     <l n="26">An apple , juice-gushing and fragrant of musk ;</l>
     <l n="27">But by daylight my fingers were crimson 'd with gore ,</l>
     <l n="28">And the half-eaten fragment was flesh at the core ;</l>
     <l n="29">And once — only once — for the love of its blush ,</l>
     <l n="30">I broke a bloom bough , but there came such a gush</l>
     <l n="31">On my hand , that it fainted away in weak fright ,</l>
     <l n="32">While the leaf-hidden woodpecker shriek 'd at the sight ;</l>
     <l n="33">And oh ! such an agony thrill 'd in that note ,</l>
     <l n="34">That my soul , startling up , beat its wings in my throat ,</l>
     <l n="35">As it long 'd to be free of a body whose hand</l>

     <l n="37">There I stood without stir , yet how willing to flee ,</l>

     <l n="39">Oh ! for innocent death ,— and to suddenly win it ,</l>
     <l n="40">I drank of the stream , but no poison was in it ;</l>
     <l n="41">I plunged in its waters , but ere I could sink ,</l>
     <l n="42">Some invisible fate pull 'd me back to the brink ;</l>
     <l n="43">I sprang from the rock , from its pinnacle height ,</l>
     <l n="44">But fell on the grass with a grasshopper 's flight ;</l>
     <l n="45">I ran at my fears — they were fears and no more ,</l>
     <l n="46">For the bear would not mangle my limbs , nor the boar ,</l>
     <l n="47">But moan 'd — all their brutalized flesh could not smother</l>

     <l n="54">His innocent tusks stain 'd with mulberry gore ;</l>
     <l n="55">And the laughing hyena — but laughing no more ;</l>
     <l n="56">And the snake , not with magical orbs to devise</l>
     <l n="57">Strange death , but with woman 's attraction of eyes ;</l>
     <l n="58">The tall ugly ape , that still bore a dim shine</l>
     <l n="59">Through his hairy eclipse of a manhood divine ;</l>
     <l n="60">And the elephant stately , with more than its reason ,</l>
     <l n="61">How thoughtful in sadness ! but this is no season</l>
     <l n="62">To reckon them up from the lag-bellied toad</l>
     <l n="63">To the mammoth , whose sobs shook his ponderous load .</l>
     <l n="64">There were woes of all shapes , wretched forms , when I came ,</l>
     <l n="65">That hung down their heads with a human-like shame ;</l>
     <l n="66">The elephant hid in the boughs , and the bear</l>
     <l n="67">Shed over his eyes the dark veil of his hair ;</l>
     <l n="68">And the womanly soul turning sick with disgust ,</l>
     <l n="69">Tried to vomit herself from her serpentine crust ;</l>
     <l n="70">While all groan 'd their groans into one at their lot ,</l>
     <l n="71">As I brought them the image of what they were not .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="72">Then rose a wild sound of the human voice choking</l>
     <l n="73">Through vile brutal organs — low tremulous croaking :</l>
     <l n="74">Cries swallow 'd abruptly — deep animal tones</l>
     <l n="75">Attuned to strange passion , and full-utter 'd groans ;</l>
     <l n="76">All shuddering weaken , till hush 'd in a pause</l>
     <l n="77">Of tongues in mute motion and wide-yawning jaws ;</l>
     <l n="78">And I guessed that those horrors were meant to tell o'er</l>
     <l n="79">The tale of their woes ; but the silence told more ,</l>
     <l n="80">That writhed on their tongues ; and I knelt on the sod ,</l>
     <l n="81">And pray 'd with my voice to the cloud-stirring god ,</l>
     <l n="82">For the sad congregation of supplicants there ,</l>
     <l n="83">That upturn 'd to his heaven brute faces of prayer ;</l>
     <l n="84">And I ceased , and they utter 'd a moaning so deep ,</l>
     <l n="85">That I wept for my heart-ease ,— but they could not weep ,</l>
     <l n="86">And gazed with red eyeballs , all wistfully dry ,</l>
     <l n="87">At the comfort of tears in a stag 's human eye .</l>
     <l n="88">Then I motion 'd them round , and , to soothe their distress ,</l>
     <l n="89">I caress 'd , and they bent them to meet my caress ,</l>
     <l n="90">Their necks to my arm , and their heads to my palm ,</l>
     <l n="91">And with poor grateful eyes suffer 'd meekly and calm</l>
     <l n="92">Those tokens of kindness , withheld by hard fate</l>
     <l n="93">From returns that might chill the warm pity to hate ;</l>
     <l n="94">So they passively bow 'd — save the serpent , that leapt</l>
     <l n="95">To my breast like a sister , and pressingly crept</l>
     <l n="96">In embrace of my neck , and with close kisses blister 'd</l>
     <l n="97">My lips in rash love ,— then drew backward , and glister 'd</l>
     <l n="98">Her eyes in my face , and loud hissing affright ,</l>
     <l n="99">Dropt down , but swift started away from my sight !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="100">This sorrow was theirs , but thrice wretched my lot ,</l>

     <l n="103">That shrouded their woe in the shade of lone places ,</l>
     <l n="104">And dash 'd off bright tears , till their fingers were wet ,</l>

     <l n="112">Might translate me in flesh to a brute ; and I dreaded</l>
     <l n="113">To gaze on their charms , lest my faith should be wedded</l>
     <l n="114">With some pity ,— and love in that pity perchance —</l>
     <l n="115">To a thing not all lovely ; for once at glance ,</l>
     <l n="116">Methought , where one sat , I descried a bright wonder</l>
     <l n="117">That flow 'd like a long silver rivulet under</l>
     <l n="118">The long fenny grass ,— with so lovely a breast ,</l>
     <l n="119">Could it be a snake-tail made the charm of the rest ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="120">So I roamed in that circle of horrors , and Fear</l>
     <l n="121">Walk 'd with me , by hills , and in valleys , and near</l>
     <l n="122">Cluster 'd trees for their gloom — not to shelter from heat —</l>
     <l n="123">But lest a brute-shadow should grow at my feet ;</l>
     <l n="124">And besides that full oft in the sunshiny place</l>
     <l n="125">Dark shadows would gather like clouds on its face ,</l>
     <l n="126">In the horrible likeness of demons ( that none</l>
     <l n="127">Could see , like invisible flames in the sun ) ;</l>
     <l n="128">But grew to one monster that seized on the light ,</l>
     <l n="129">Like the dragon that strangles the moon in the night ;</l>
     <l n="130">Fierce sphinxes , long serpents , and asps of the south ;</l>
     <l n="131">Wild birds of huge beak , and all horrors that drouth</l>
     <l n="132">Engenders of slime in the land of the pest ,</l>
     <l n="133">Vile shapes without shape , and foul bats of the West ,</l>
     <l n="134">Bringing Night on their wings ; and the bodies wherein</l>
     <l n="135">Great Brahma imprisons the spirits of sin ,</l>
     <l n="136">Many-handed , that blent in one phantom of fight</l>
     <l n="137">Like a Titan , and threatfully warr 'd with the light ;</l>
     <l n="138">I have heard the wild shriek that gave signal to close ,</l>
     <l n="139">When they rushed on that shadowy Python of foes ,</l>
     <l n="140">That met with sharp beaks and wide gaping of jaws ,</l>
     <l n="141">With flappings of wings , and fierce grasping of claws ,</l>
     <l n="142">And whirls of long tails :— I have seen the quick flutter</l>
     <l n="143">Of fragments dissevered ,— and necks stretch 'd to utter</l>
     <l n="144">Long screamings of pain ,— the swift motion of blows ,</l>
     <l n="145">And wrestling of arms — to the flight at the close ,</l>
     <l n="146">When the dust of the earth startled upward in rings ,</l>
     <l n="147">And flew on the whirlwind that follow 'd their wings .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="148">Thus they fled — not forgotten — but often to grow</l>
     <l n="149">Like fears in my eyes , when I walk 'd to and fro</l>
     <l n="150">In the shadows , and felt from some beings unseen</l>
     <l n="151">The warm touch of kisses , but clean or unclean</l>
     <l n="152">I knew not , nor whether the love I had won</l>
     <l n="153">Was of heaven or hell — till one day in the sun ,</l>
     <l n="154">In its very noon-blaze , I could fancy a thing</l>
     <l n="155">Of beauty , but faint as the cloud-mirrors fling</l>
     <l n="156">On the gaze of the shepherd that watches the sky ,</l>
     <l n="157">Half-seen and half-dream 'd in the soul of his eye .</l>
     <l n="158">And when in my musings I gazed on the stream ,</l>
     <l n="159">In motionless trances of thought , there would seem</l>
     <l n="160">A face like that face , looking upward through mine :</l>
     <l n="161">With his eyes full of love , and the dim-drownd shine</l>
     <l n="162">Of limbs and fair garments , like clouds in that blue</l>
     <l n="163">Serene :— there I stood for long hours but to view</l>
     <l n="164">Those fond earnest eyes that were ever uplifted</l>
     <l n="165">Towards me , and wink 'd as the water-weed drifted</l>
     <l n="166">Between ; but the fish knew that presence , and plied</l>
     <l n="167">Their long curvy tails , and swift darted aside .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="168">There I gazed for lost time , and forgot all the things</l>
     <l n="169">That once had been wonders — the fishes with wings ,</l>
     <l n="170">And the glimmer of magnified eyes that look 'd up</l>
     <l n="171">From the glooms of the bottom like pearls in a cup ,</l>
     <l n="172">And the huge endless serpent of silvery gleam ,</l>
     <l n="173">Slow winding along like a tide in the stream .</l>
     <l n="174">Some maid of the waters , some Naiad , methought</l>
     <l n="175">Held me dear in the pearl of her eye — and I brought</l>
     <l n="176">My wish to that fancy ; and often I dash 'd</l>
     <l n="177">My limbs in the water , and suddenly splash 'd</l>
     <l n="178">The cool drops around me , yet clung to the brink ,</l>
     <l n="179">Chill 'd by watery fears , how that beauty might sink</l>
     <l n="180">With my life in her arms to her garden , and bind me</l>
     <l n="181">With its long tangled grasses , or cruelly wind me</l>
     <l n="182">In some eddy to hum out my life in her ear ,</l>
     <l n="183">Like a spider-caught bee ,— and in aid of that fear</l>
     <l n="184">Came the tardy remembrance — Oh falsest of men !</l>
     <l n="185">Why was not that beauty remember 'd till then ?</l>
     <l n="186">My love , my safe love , whose glad life would have run</l>
     <l n="187">Into mine — like a drop — that our fate might be one ,</l>
     <l n="188">That now , even now ,— may-be ,— clasp 'd in a dream ,</l>
     <l n="189">That form which I gave to some jilt of the stream ,</l>
     <l n="190">And gazed with fond eyes that her tears tried to smother</l>
     <l n="191">On a mock of those eyes that I gave to another !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="192">Then I rose from the stream , but the eyes of my mind ,</l>
     <l n="193">Still full of the tempter , kept gazing behind</l>
     <l n="194">On her crystalline face , while I painfully leapt</l>
     <l n="195">To the bank , and shook off the curst waters , and wept</l>
     <l n="196">With my brow in the reeds ; and the reeds to my ear</l>
     <l n="197">Bow 'd , bent by no wind , and in whispers of fear ,</l>
     <l n="198">Growing small with large secrets , foretold me of one</l>
     <l n="199">That loved me ,— but oh to fly from her , and shun</l>
     <l n="200">Her love like a pest — though her love was as true</l>
     <l n="201">To mine as her stream to the heavenly blue ;</l>
     <l n="202">For why should I love her with love that would bring</l>
     <l n="203">All misfortune , like hate , on so joyous a thing ?</l>
     <l n="204">Because of her rival ,— even Her whose witch-face</l>
     <l n="205">I had slighted , and therefore was doom 'd in that place</l>
     <l n="206">To roam , and had roam 'd , where all horrors grew rank ,</l>
     <l n="207">Nine days ere I wept with my brow on that bank ;</l>
     <l n="208">Her name be not named , but her spite would not fail</l>
     <l n="209">To our love like a blight ; and they told me the tale</l>
     <l n="210">Of Scylla ,— and Picus , imprison 'd to speak</l>
     <l n="211">His shrill-screaming woe through a woodpecker 's beak .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="212">Then they ceased — I had heard as the voice of my star</l>
     <l n="213">That told me the truth of my fortunes — thus far</l>
     <l n="214">I had read of my sorrow , and lay in the hush</l>
     <l n="215">Of deep meditation ,— when lo ! a light crush</l>
     <l n="216">Of the reeds , and I turn 'd and look 'd round in the night</l>
     <l n="217">Of new sunshine , and saw , as I sipp 'd of the light</l>
     <l n="218">Narrow-winking , the realized nymph of the stream ,</l>
     <l n="219">Rising up from the wave with the bend and the gleam</l>
     <l n="220">Of a fountain , and o'er her white arms she kept throwing</l>
     <l n="221">Bright torrents of hair , that went flowing and flowing</l>
     <l n="222">In falls to her feet , and the blue waters roll 'd</l>
     <l n="223">Down her limbs like a garment , in many a fold ,</l>
     <l n="224">Sun-spangled , gold-broider 'd , and fled far behind ,</l>
     <l n="225">Like an infinite train . So she came and reclined</l>
     <l n="226">In the reeds , and I hunger 'd to see her unseal</l>
     <l n="227">The buds of her eyes that would ope and reveal</l>
     <l n="228">The blue that was in them ;— they oped and she raised</l>
     <l n="229">Two orbs of pure crystal , and timidly gazed</l>
     <l n="230">With her eyes on my eyes ; but their color and shine</l>
     <l n="231">Was of that which they look 'd on , and mostly of mine —</l>
     <l n="232">For she loved me ,— except when she blush 'd , and they sank ,</l>
     <l n="233">Shame-humbled , to number the stones on the bank ,</l>
     <l n="234">Or her play-idle fingers , while lisping she told me</l>
     <l n="235">How she put on her veil , and in love to behold me</l>
     <l n="236">Would wing through the sun till she fainted away</l>
     <l n="237">Like a mist , and then flew to her waters and lay</l>
     <l n="238">In love-patience long hours , and sore dazzled her eyes</l>
     <l n="239">In watching for mine ‘ gainst the midsummer skies .</l>
     <l n="240">But now they were heal 'd ,— O my heart , it still dances</l>
     <l n="241">When I think of the charm of her changeable glances ,</l>
     <l n="242">And my image how small when it sank in the deep</l>
     <l n="243">Of her eyes where her soul was ,— Alas ! now they weep ,</l>
     <l n="244">And none knoweth where . In what stream do her eyes</l>
     <l n="245">Shed invisible tears ? Who beholds where her sighs</l>
     <l n="246">Flow in eddies , or sees the ascent of the leaf</l>
     <l n="247">She has pluck 'd with her tresses ? Who listens her grief</l>
     <l n="248">Like a far fall of waters , or hears where her feet</l>
     <l n="249">Grow emphatic among the loose pebbles , and beat</l>
     <l n="250">Them together ? Ah ! surely her flowers float adown</l>
     <l n="251">To the sea unaccepted , and little ones drown</l>
     <l n="252">For need of her mercy ,— even he whose twin-brother</l>
     <l n="253">Will miss him forever ; and the sorrowful mother</l>
     <l n="254">Imploreth in vain for his body to kiss</l>
     <l n="255">And cling to , all dripping and cold as it is ,</l>
     <l n="256">Because that soft pity is lost in hard pain</l>
     <l n="257">We loved ,— how we loved !— for I thought not again</l>
     <l n="258">Of the woes that were whisper 'd like fears in that place</l>
     <l n="259">If I gave me to beauty . Her face was the face ,</l>
     <l n="260">Far away , and her eyes were the eyes that were drown 'd</l>
     <l n="261">For my absence ,— her arms were the arms that sought round</l>
     <l n="262">And claspt me to nought ; for I gazed and became</l>
     <l n="263">Only true to my falsehood , and had but one name</l>
     <l n="264">For two loves , and call 'd ever on Ægle , sweet maid</l>
     <l n="265">Of the sky-loving waters ,— and was not afraid</l>
     <l n="266">Of the sight of her skin ;— for it never could be ;</l>
     <l n="267">Her beauty and love were misfortunes to me !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="268">Thus our bliss had endured for a time-shorten 'd space ,</l>
     <l n="269">Like a day made of three , and the smile of her face</l>
     <l n="270">Had been with me for joy ,— when she told me indeed</l>
     <l n="271">Her love was self-task 'd with a work that would need</l>
     <l n="272">Some short hours , for in truth ‘ twas the veriest pity</l>
     <l n="273">Our love should not last , and then sang me a ditty ,</l>
     <l n="274">Of one with warm lips that should love her , and love her</l>
     <l n="275">When suns were burnt dim and long ages past over .</l>
     <l n="276">So she fled with her voice , and I patiently nested</l>
     <l n="277">My limbs in the reeds , in still quiet , and rested</l>
     <l n="278">Till my thoughts grew extinct , and I sank in a sleep</l>
     <l n="279">Of dreams ,— but their meaning was hidden too deep</l>
     <l n="280">To be read what their woe was ;— but still it was woe</l>
     <l n="281">That was writ on all faces that swam to and fro</l>
     <l n="282">In that river of night ;— and the gaze of their eyes</l>
     <l n="283">Was sad ,— and the bend of their brows ,— and their cries</l>
     <l n="284">Were seen , but I heard not . The warm touch of tears</l>
     <l n="285">Travell 'd down my cold cheeks , and I shook till my fears</l>
     <l n="286">Awaked me , and lo ! I was couch 'd in a bower ,</l>
     <l n="287">The growth of long summers rear 'd up in an hour !</l>
     <l n="288">Then I said , in the fear of my dream , I will fly</l>
     <l n="289">From this magic , but could not , because that my eye</l>
     <l n="290">Grew love-idle among the rich blooms ; and the earth</l>
     <l n="291">Held me down with its coolness of touch , and the mirth</l>
     <l n="292">Of some bird was above me ,— who , even in fear ,</l>
     <l n="293">Would startle the thrush ? and methought there drew near</l>
     <l n="294">A form as of Ægle ,— but it was not the face</l>
     <l n="295">Hope made , and I knew the witch-Queen of that place ,</l>
     <l n="296">Even Circe the Cruel , that came like a Death ,</l>
     <l n="297">Which I fear 'd , and yet fled not , for want of my breath .</l>
     <l n="298">There was thought in her face , and her eyes were not raised</l>
     <l n="299">From the grass at her foot , but I saw , as I gazed ,</l>
     <l n="300">Her spite — and her countenance changed with her mind</l>
     <l n="301">As she plann 'd how to thrall me with beauty , and bind</l>
     <l n="302">My soul to her charms ,— and her long tresses play 'd</l>
     <l n="303">From shade into shine and from shine into shade ,</l>
     <l n="304">Like a day in mid-autumn ,— first fair , O how fair !</l>
     <l n="305">With long snaky locks of the adder-black hair</l>
     <l n="306">That clung round her neck ,— those dark locks that I prize ,</l>
     <l n="307">For the sake of a maid that once loved me with eyes</l>
     <l n="308">Of that fathomless hue ,— but they changed as they roll 'd ,</l>
     <l n="309">And brighten 'd , and suddenly blazed into gold</l>
     <l n="310">That she comb 'd into flames , and the locks that fell down</l>
     <l n="311">Turn 'd dark as they fell , but I slighted their brown ,</l>
     <l n="312">Nor loved , till I saw the light ringlets shed wild ,</l>
     <l n="313">That innocence wears when she is but a child ;</l>
     <l n="314">And her eyes ,— Oh I ne'er had been witched with their shine ,</l>
     <l n="315">Had they been any other , my Ægle , than thine !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="316">Then I gave me to magic , and gazed till I madden 'd</l>
     <l n="317">In the full of their light ,— but I sadden 'd and sadden 'd</l>
     <l n="318">The deeper I look 'd ,— till I sank on the snow</l>
     <l n="319">Of her bosom , a thing made of terror and woe ,</l>
     <l n="320">And answer 'd its throb with the shudder of fears ,</l>
     <l n="321">And hid my cold eyes from her eyes with my tears ,</l>
     <l n="322">And strain 'd her white arms with the still languid weight</l>
     <l n="323">Of a fainting distress . There she sat like the Fate</l>
     <l n="324">That is nurse unto Death , and bent over in shame</l>
     <l n="325">To hide me from her the true Ægle — that came</l>
     <l n="326">With the words on her lips the false witch had fore-given</l>
     <l n="327">To make me immortal — for now I was even</l>
     <l n="328">At the portals of Death , who but waited the hush</l>
     <l n="329">Of world-sounds in my ears to cry welcome , and rush</l>
     <l n="330">With my soul to the banks of his black-flowing river .</l>
     <l n="331">Oh , would it had flown from my body forever ,</l>
     <l n="332">Ere I listen 'd those words , when I felt with a start ,</l>
     <l n="333">The life-blood rush back in one throb to my heart ,</l>
     <l n="334">And saw the pale lips where the rest of that spell</l>
     <l n="335">Had perished in horror — and heard the farewell</l>
     <l n="336">Of that voice that was drown 'd in the dash of the stream !</l>
     <l n="337">How fain had I follow 'd , and plunged with that scream</l>
     <l n="338">Into death , but my being indignantly lagg 'd</l>
     <l n="339">Through the brutalized flesh that I painfully dragg 'd</l>
     <l n="340">Behind me :— O Circe ! O mother of spite !</l>
     <l n="341">Speak the last of that curse ! and imprison me quite</l>
     <l n="342">In the husk of a brute ,— that no pity may name</l>
     <l n="343">The man that I was ,— that no kindred may claim —</l>
     <l n="344">“ The monster I am ! Let me utterly be</l>
     <l n="345">Brute-buried , and Nature 's dishonor with me</l>
     <l n="346">Uninscribed ! ” — But she listen 'd my prayer , that was praise</l>
     <l n="347">To her malice , with smiles , and advised me to gaze</l>
     <l n="348">On the river for love ,— and perchance she would make</l>
     <l n="349">In pity a maid without eyes for my sake ,</l>
     <l n="350">And she left me like Scorn . Then I ask 'd of the wave ,</l>
     <l n="351">What monster I was , and it trembled and gave</l>
     <l n="352">The true shape of my grief , and I turn 'd with my face</l>
     <l n="353">From all waters forever , and fled through that place ,</l>
     <l n="354">Till with horror more strong than all magic I pass 'd</l>
     <l n="355">Its bounds , and the world was before me at last .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="356">There I wander 'd in sorrow , and shunned the abodes</l>
     <l n="357">Of men , that stood up in the likeness of Gods ,</l>
     <l n="358">But I saw from afar the warm shine of the sun</l>
     <l n="359">On the cities , where man was a million , not one ;</l>
     <l n="360">And I saw the white smoke of their altars ascending ,</l>
     <l n="361">That show 'd where the hearts of many were blending ,</l>
     <l n="362">And the wind in my face brought shrill voices that came</l>
     <l n="363">From the trumpets that gather 'd whole bands in one fame</l>
     <l n="364">As a chorus of man ,— and they stream 'd from the gates</l>
     <l n="365">Like a dusky libation poured out to the Fates .</l>
     <l n="366">But at times there were gentler processions of peace</l>
     <l n="367">That I watch 'd with my soul in my eyes till their cease ,</l>
     <l n="368">There were women ! there men ! but to me a third sex</l>

     <l n="370">And oft to assuage a sad yearning of eyes</l>
     <l n="371">I stole near the city , but stole covert-wise</l>
     <l n="372">Like a wild beast of love , and perchance to be smitten</l>
     <l n="373">By some hand that I rather had wept on than bitten !</l>
     <l n="374">Oh , I once had a haunt near a cot where a mother</l>
     <l n="375">Daily sat in the shade with her child , and would smother</l>
     <l n="376">Its eyelids in kisses , and then in its sleep</l>
     <l n="377">Sang dreams in its ear of its manhood , while deep</l>
     <l n="378">In a thicket of willows I gazed o'er the brooks</l>

     <l n="394">He came , with his face of bold wonder , to feel ,</l>

     <l n="408">That dissever 'd my ear ,— but I felt not , whose fate</l>

     <l n="413">Was self-shut against me ; for why should I come</l>
     <l n="414">Like an after-distress to my gray-bearded father ,</l>
     <l n="415">With a blight to the last of his sight ?— let him rather</l>

     <l n="417">Where I was not , and still in fond memory turn</l>
     <l n="418">To his son even such as he left him . Oh , how</l>
     <l n="419">Could I walk with the youth once my fellows , but now</l>
     <l n="420">Like Gods to my humbled estate ?— or how bear</l>
     <l n="421">The steeds once the pride of my eyes and the care</l>
     <l n="422">Of my hands ? Then I turn 'd me self-banish 'd , and came</l>
     <l n="423">Into Thessaly here , where I met with the same</l>
     <l n="424">As myself . I have heard how they met by a stream</l>
     <l n="425">In games , and were suddenly changed by a scream</l>
     <l n="426">That made wretches of many , as she roll 'd her wild eyes</l>
     <l n="427">Against heaven , and so vanish 'd .— The gentle and wise</l>

   <p>THE PLEA OF THE MIDSUMMER FAIRIES .<span corresp="#note8" type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span></p>
   <note xml:id="note8" place="bottom" n="8">The opening Poem in the volume published by Hood in 1827 , under the same title . The Poem was prefaced by the following letter to Charles Lamb :—</note>
   <p>“ My dear Friend , I thank my literary fortune that I am not reduced like many better wits to barter dedications , for the hope or promise of patronage , with some nominally great man ; but that where true affection points , and honest respect , I am free to gratify my head and heart by a sincere inscription . An intimacy and dearness , worthy of a much earlier date than our acquaintance can refer to , direct me at once to your name ; and with this acknowledgment of your ever kind feeling towards me , I desire to record a respect and admiration for you as a writer , which no one acquainted with our literature , save Elia himself , will think disproportionate or misplaced . If I had not these better reasons to govern me , I should be guided to the same selection by your intense yet critical relish for the works of the great Dramatist , and for that favorite play in particular which has furnished the subject of my verses .</p>
   <p>It is my design in the following poem to celebrate by an allegory that immortality which Shakspeare has conferred on the fairy mythology by his Midsummer Night 's Dream . But for him , those pretty children of our childhood would leave barely their names to our maturer years ; they belong , as the mites upon the plumb , to the bloom of fancy , a thing generally too frail and beautiful to withstand the rude handling of time : but the Poet has made this most perishable part of the mind 's creation equal to the most enduring ; he has so intertwined the Elfins with human sympathies , and linked them by so many delightful associations with the productions of nature , that they are as real to the mind 's eye , as their green magical circles to the outer sense . It would have been a pity for such a race to go extinct , even though they were but as the butterflies that hover about the leaves and blossoms of the visible world . I am , my dear friend , yours most truly , T. HOOD . ” ]</p>

   <p>THE DREAM OF EUGENE ARAM .<span corresp="#note9" type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span></p>
   <note xml:id="note9" place="bottom" n="9">Hood edited The Gem , one of the many annuals of that day , for the year 1829 . The volume is memorable for having contained his fine poem .</note>
   <p>“ The remarkable name of Eugene Aram , belonging to a man of unusual talents and acquirements , is unhappily associated with a deed of blood as extraordinary in its details as any recorded in our calendar of crime . In the year 1745 , being then an usher and deeply engaged in the study of Chaldee , Hebrew , Arabic , and the Celtic dialects , for the formation of a lexicon , he abruptly turned over a still darker page in human knowledge , and the brow that learning might have made illustrious was stamped ignominious forever with the brand of Cain . To obtain a trifling property he concerted with an accomplice , and with his own hand effected the violent death of one Daniel Clarke , a shoe-maker , of Knaresborough , in Yorkshire . For fourteen years nearly the secret slept with the victim in the earth of St. Robert 's Cave , and the manner of its discovery would appear a striking example of the divine justice even amongst those marvels narrated in that curious old volume alluded to in the Fortunes of Nigel , under its quaint title of ‘ God 's Revenge against Murther . ’</p>
   <p>“ The accidental digging up of a skeleton , and the unwary and emphatic declaration of Aram 's accomplice that it could not be that of Clarke , betraying a guilty knowledge of the true bones , he was wrought to a confession of their deposit . The learned homicide was seized and arraigned , and a trial of uncommon interest was wound up by a defence as memorable as the tragedy itself for eloquence and ingenuity — too ingenious for innocence , and eloquent enough to do credit even to that long premeditation which the interval between the deed and its discovery had afforded . That this dreary period had not passed without paroxysms of remorse may be inferred from a fact of affecting interest . The late Admiral Burney was a scholar at the school at Lynn in Norfolk when Aram was an usher , subsequent to his crime . The Admiral stated that Aram was beloved by the boys , and that he used to discourse to them of murder , not occasionally , as I have written elsewhere , but constantly , and in somewhat of the spirit ascribed to him in the poem .</p>
   <p>“ For the more imaginative part of the version I must refer back to one of those unaccountable visions which come upon us like frightful monsters thrown up by storms from the great black deeps of slumber . A lifeless body , in love and relationship the nearest and dearest , was imposed upon my back , with an overwhelming sense of obligation — not of filial piety merely , but some awful responsibility , equally vague and intense , and involving , as it seemed , inexpiable sin , horrors unutterable , torments intolerable — to bury my dead , like Abraham , out of my sight . In vain I attempted , again and again , to obey the mysterious mandate — by some dreadful process the burthen was replaced with a more stupendous weight of injunction , and an apalling conviction of the impossibility of its fulfilment . My mental anguish was indescribable ;— the mighty agonies of souls tortured on the supernatural racks of sleep are not to be penned — and if in sketching those that belong to blood-guiltiness I have been at all successful , I owe it mainly to the uninvoked inspiration of that terrible dream . ”</p>
   <p>The introduction of Admiral Burney 's name makes it likely that Hood may have owed his first interest in the story to Charles Lamb . The circumstance that the book over which the gentle boy was poring when questioned by the usher was called the Death of Abel , is by no means forced or unnatural . Salomon Gessner 's prose poem , Der Tod Abels , published in 1758 , attained an astonishing popularity throughout Europe , and appeared in an English version somewhere about the time of the discovery of Aram 's crime . ]</p>

    <head>THE DEATH-BED .<span corresp="#note10" type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span></head>
    <note xml:id="note10" place="bottom" n="10">The Englishman 's Magazine , August 1831 . This magazine was a venture of Edward Moxon , the publisher , but had a career of only seven months . It is memorable , however , for including , besides the above and various papers by Charles Lamb , poetical contributions from Tennyson and Arthur Hallam , and also for containing the review by the latter of Tennyson 's first volume of poems , published in 1830 . The beautiful stanzas of Hood 's appear here , as far as I have discovered , for the first time . The date of their composition remains unfixed . Hood 's son was under the impression that they were written on the death of one of his father 's sisters , but supplied no evidence bearing on the question .</note>

     <l n="6">Casting their shadows across sunny hours .</l>
     <l n="7">Oh , there was nothing sorrowful in flowers</l>
     <l n="8">Wooing the glances of an April sun ,</l>

     <l n="22">She raised it in the sun . All these were dear</l>
     <l n="23">To heart and eye — but an invisible fear</l>
     <l n="24">Shook in the trees and chilled upon the air ,</l>
     <l n="25">And if one spot was laughing brightest — there</l>
     <l n="26">My soul most sank and darkened in despair !—</l>
     <l n="27">As if the shadows of a curtained room</l>
     <l n="28">Haunted me in the sun — as if the bloom</l>
     <l n="29">Of early flow'rets had no sweets for me ,</l>
     <l n="30">Nor apple blossoms any blush to see —</l>
     <l n="31">As if the hour had brought too bright a day —</l>
     <l n="32">And little birds were all too gay !— too gay !—</l>
     <l n="33">As if the beauty of that Lovely One</l>
     <l n="34">Were all a fable .— Full before the sun</l>

   <p>ODE TO RAE WILSON , ESQ .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>TO THE EDITOR OF THE ATHENÆUM .</head>
    <head>MY DEAR SIR — The following Ode was written anticipating the tone of some strictures on my writings by the gentleman to whom it is addressed . I have not seen his book ; but I know by hearsay that some of my verses are characterized as “ profaneness and ribaldry ” — citing , in proof , the description of a certain sow , from whose jaw a cabbage sprout</head>
     <l n="1">“ Protruded , as the dove so staunch</l>
     <l n="2">For peace supports an olive branch . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>If the printed works of my Censor had not prepared me for any misapplication of types , I should have been surprised by this misapprehension of one of the commonest emblems . In some cases the dove unquestionably stands for the Divine Spirit ; but the same bird is also a lay representative of the peace of this world , and , as such , has figured time out of mind in allegorical pictures . The sense in which it was used by me is plain from the context ; at least , it would be plain to any one but a fisher for faults , predisposed to carp at some things , to dab at others , and to flounder in all . But I am possibly in error . It is the female swine , perhaps , that is profaned in the eyes of the Oriental tourist . Men find strange ways of marking their intolerance ; and the spirit is certainly strong enough , in Mr. W .' s works , to set up a creature as sacred , in sheer opposition to the Mussulman , with whom she is a beast of abomination . It would only be going the whole sow .— I am , dear Sir , yours very truly , THOS . HOOD .</p>

     <l n="2">In the very spring of her married life ,</l>
     <l n="3">To be chill 'd by its wintry weather —</l>
     <l n="4">But instead of sitting as Love-Birds do ,</l>
     <l n="5">On Hymen 's turtles that bill and coo —</l>

     <l n="3">And slips in his conversations —</l>
     <l n="4">Fears , which all her peace destroy 'd ,</l>
     <l n="5">That his title was null — his coffers were void —</l>
     <l n="6">And his French Château was in Spain , or enjoy 'd</l>

     <l n="3">And hold his affections in fetters —</l>
     <l n="4">Alas ! that hope , like a crazy ship ,</l>
     <l n="5">Was forced its anchor and cable to slip</l>
     <l n="6">When , seduced by her fears , she took a dip</l>

The likening of Dominie Sampson to Lamb 's friend , George Dyer and the comparison of Mause Headrigg to Rae Wilson on his travels , are admirable examples .</note>

     <l n="4">Mr. Scrub — Mr. Slop — or whoever you be !</l>
     <l n="5">The Cock of Steam Laundries ,— the head Patentee</l>
     <l n="6">Of Associate Cleansers ,— Chief founder and prime</l>
     <l n="7">Of the firm for the wholesale distilling of grime —</l>
     <l n="8">Co-partners and dealers , in linen 's propriety —</l>
     <l n="9">That make washing public — and wash in society —</l>
     <l n="10">O lend me your ear ! if that ear can forego ,</l>
     <l n="11">For a moment , the music that bubbles below ,—</l>
     <l n="12">From your new Surrey Geisers all foaming and hot ,—</l>
     <l n="13">That soft “ simmer 's sang ” so endear 'd to the Scot —</l>
     <l n="14">If your hands may stand still , or your steam without danger —</l>
     <l n="15">If your suds will not cool , and a mere simple stranger ,</l>
     <l n="16">Both to you and to washing , may put in a rub ,—</l>
     <l n="17">O wipe out your Amazon arms from the tub ,—</l>
     <l n="18">And lend me your ear ,— Let me modestly plead</l>
     <l n="19">For a race that your labors may soon supersede —</l>
     <l n="20">For a race that , now washing no living affords —</l>
     <l n="21">Like Grimaldi must leave their aquatic old boards ,</l>
     <l n="22">Not with pence in their pockets to keep them at ease ,</l>
     <l n="23">Not with bread in the funds — or investments of cheese ,—</l>
     <l n="24">But to droop like sad willows that liv 'd by a stream ,</l>
     <l n="25">Which the sun has suck 'd up into vapor and steam .</l>
     <l n="26">Ah , look at the laundress , before you begrudge —</l>
     <l n="27">Her hard daily bread to that laudable drudge —</l>
     <l n="28">When chanticleer singeth his earliest matins ,</l>
     <l n="29">She slips her amphibious feet in her pattens ,</l>
     <l n="30">And beginneth her toil while the morn is still gray ,</l>
     <l n="31">As if she was washing the night into day —</l>
     <l n="32">Not with sleeker or rosier fingers Aurora</l>
     <l n="33">Beginneth to scatter the dewdrops before her ;</l>
     <l n="34">Not Venus that rose from the billow so early ,</l>
     <l n="35">Look 'd down on the foam with a forehead more pearly —</l>
     <l n="36">Her head is involv 'd in an aërial mist ,</l>
     <l n="37">And a bright-beaded bracelet encircles her wrist ;</l>
     <l n="38">Her visage glows warm with the ardor of duty ;</l>
     <l n="39">She 's Industry 's moral — she 's all moral beauty !</l>
     <l n="40">Growing brighter and brighter at every rub —</l>
     <l n="41">Would any man ruin her ?— No , Mr. Scrub !</l>
     <l n="42">No man that is manly would work her mishap —</l>
     <l n="43">No man that is manly would covet her cap —</l>
     <l n="44">Nor her apron — her hose — nor her gown made of stuff —</l>
     <l n="45">Nor her gin — nor her tea — nor her wet pinch of snuff !</l>
     <l n="46">Alas ! so she thought — but that slippery hope</l>
     <l n="47">Has betrayed her — as tho ’ she had trod on her soap !</l>
     <l n="48">And she ,— whose support ,— like the fishes that fly ,</l>
     <l n="49">Was to have her fins wet , must now drop from her sky —</l>
     <l n="50">She whose living it was , and a part of her fare ,</l>
     <l n="51">To be damp 'd once a day , like the great white sea bear ,</l>
     <l n="52">With her hands like a sponge , and her head like a mop —</l>
     <l n="53">Quite a living absorbent that revell 'd in slop —</l>
     <l n="54">She that paddled in water , must walk upon sand ,</l>
     <l n="55">And sigh for her deeps like a turtle on land !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="56">Lo , then , the poor laundress , all wretched she stands ,</l>
     <l n="57">Instead of a counterpane wringing her hands !</l>
     <l n="58">All haggard and pinch 'd , going down in life 's vale ,</l>
     <l n="59">With no fagot for burning , like Allan-a-dale !</l>
     <l n="60">No smoke from her flue — and no steam from her pane ,</l>
     <l n="61">There once she watch 'd heaven , fearing God and the rain —</l>
     <l n="62">Or gaz 'd o'er her bleach-field so fairly engross 'd ,</l>
     <l n="63">Till the lines wander 'd idle from pillar to post !</l>
     <l n="64">Ah , where are the playful young pinners — ah , where</l>
     <l n="65">The harlequin quilts that cut capers in air —</l>
     <l n="66">The brisk waltzing stockings — the white and the black ,</l>
     <l n="67">That danced on the tight-rope , or swung on the slack —</l>
     <l n="68">The light sylph-like garments , so tenderly pinn 'd ,</l>
     <l n="69">That blew into shape , and embodied the wind !</l>
     <l n="70">There was white on the grass — there was white on the spray —</l>
     <l n="71">Her garden — it looked like a garden of May !</l>
     <l n="72">But now all is dark — not a shirt 's on a shrub —</l>
     <l n="73">You 've ruin 'd her prospects in life , Mr. Scrub !</l>
     <l n="74">You 've ruin 'd her custom — now families drop her —</l>
     <l n="75">From her silver reduc 'd — nay , reduc 'd from her copper !</l>
     <l n="76">The last of her washing is done at her eye ,</l>
     <l n="77">One poor little kerchief that never gets dry !</l>
     <l n="78">From mere lack of linen she can n't lay a cloth ,</l>
     <l n="79">And boils neither barley nor alkaline broth ,—</l>
     <l n="80">But her children come round her as victuals grow scant ,</l>
     <l n="81">And recall , with foul faces , the source of their want —</l>
     <l n="82">When she thinks of their poor little mouths to be fed ,</l>
     <l n="83">And then thinks of her trade that is utterly dead ,</l>
     <l n="84">And even its pearlashes laid in the grave —</l>
     <l n="85">Whilst her tub is a dry rotting , stave after stave ,</l>
     <l n="86">And the greatest of Coopers , ev'n he that they dub</l>
     <l n="87">Sir Astley , can n't bind up her heart or her tub ,—</l>
     <l n="88">Need you wonder she curses your bones , Mr. Scrub !</l>
     <l n="89">Need you wonder , when steam has depriv 'd her of bread ,</l>
     <l n="90">If she prays that the evil may visit your head —</l>
     <l n="91">Nay , scald all the heads of your Washing Committee ,—</l>
     <l n="92">If she wishes you all the soot blacks of the city —</l>
     <l n="93">In short , not to mention all plagues without number ,</l>
     <l n="94">If she wishes you all in the Wash at the Humber !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="95">Ah , perhaps , in some moment of drowth and despair ,</l>
     <l n="96">When her linen got scarce , and her washing grew rare —</l>
     <l n="97">When the sum of her suds might be summ 'd in a bowl ,</l>
     <l n="98">And the rusty cold iron quite enter 'd her soul —</l>
     <l n="99">When , perhaps , the last glance of her wandering eye</l>
     <l n="100">Had caught “ the Cock Laundresses ’ Coach ” going by ,</l>
     <l n="101">Or her lines that hung idle , to waste the fine weather ,</l>
     <l n="102">And she thought of her wrongs and her rights both together ,</l>
     <l n="103">In a lather of passion that froth 'd as it rose ,</l>
     <l n="104">Too angry for grammar , too lofty for prose ,</l>
     <l n="105">On her sheet — if a sheet were still left her — to write ,</l>
     <l n="106">Some remonstrance like this then , perchance , saw the light —</l>

     <l n="2">Jobs as is Woman 's right to do — and go about there Own —</l>
     <l n="3">Theirs Reforms enuff Alreddy without your new schools</l>
     <l n="4">For washing to sit Up ,— and push the Old Tubs from their stools !</l>
     <l n="5">But your just like the Raddicals ,— for upsetting of the Sudds</l>
     <l n="6">When the world wagged well enuff — and Wommen washed your old dirty duds ,</l>
     <l n="7">I 'm Certain sure Enuff your Ann Sisters had no steem Indians , that 's Flat ,—</l>
     <l n="8">But I warrant your Four Fathers went as Tidy and gentlemanny for all that —</l>
     <l n="9">I suppose your the Family as lived in the Great Kittle</l>
     <l n="10">I see on Clapham Commun , some times a very considerable period back when</l>
     <l n="11">I were little ,</l>
     <l n="12">And they Said it went with Steem ,— But that was a joke !</l>
     <l n="13">For I never see none come of it ,— that 's out of it — but only sum Smoak —</l>
     <l n="14">And for All your Power of Horses about your Indians you never had but Two</l>
     <l n="15">In my time to draw you About to Fairs — and hang you , you know that 's true !</l>
     <l n="16">And for All your fine Perspectuses ,— howsomever you bewhich ‘ em ,</l>
     <l n="17">Theirs as Pretty ones off Primerows Hill , as ever a one at Mitchum ,</l>
     <l n="18">Tho ’ I cant sea What Prospectives and washing has with one another to Do —</l>
     <l n="19">It aint as if a Bird'seye Hankicher could take a Birds-high view !</l>
     <l n="20">But Thats your look out — I 've not much to do with that — But pleas God to</l>

     <l n="24">Without going any Father off then Little Parodies Place ,</l>
     <l n="25">And Thats more than you Can — and I 'll say it behind your face —</l>
     <l n="26">But when Folks talks of washing , it aint for you to Speak ,—</l>
     <l n="27">As kept Dockter Pattyson out of his Shirt for a Weak !</l>
     <l n="28">Thinks I , when I heard it — Well there 's a pretty go !</l>
     <l n="29">That comes o ’ not marking of things or washing out the marks , and</l>
     <l n="30">Huddling ‘ em up so !</l>
     <l n="31">Till Their friends conies and owns them , like drownded corpeses in a Vault ,</l>
     <l n="32">But may Hap you havint Larn 'd to spel — and That aint your Fault ,</l>
     <l n="33">Only you ought to leafe the Linnins to them as has Larn 'd ,—</l>

   <p>FAITHLESS SALLY BROWN .<span corresp="#note26" type="note_anchor">[ 26 ]</span></p>
   <note xml:id="note26" place="bottom" n="26">These famous verses were first published as from an anonymous correspondent in the London Magazine . When Hood reprinted them , under his own name , in the first series of Whims and Oddities , he prefaced them with the following words :—</note>
   <p>“ I have never been vainer of any verses than of my part in the following Ballad . Dr. Watts , amongst evangelical nurses , has an enviable renown ; and Campbell 's Ballads enjoy a snug , genteel popularity . Sally Brown has been favored perhaps with as wide a patronage as the Moral Songs , though its circle may not have been of so select a class as the friends of ‘ Hohenlinden . ’ But I do not desire to see it amongst what are called Elegant Extracts . The lamented Emery , dressed as Tom Tug , sang it at his last mortal benefit at Covent Garden ; and ever since it has been a great favorite with the watermen of Thames , who time their oars to it , as the wherrymen of Venice time theirs to the lines of Tasso . With the watermen it went naturally to Vauxhall , and over land to Sadler 's Wells . The Guards — not the mail coach , but the Lifeguards — picked it out from a fluttering hundred of others , all going to one air , against the dead wall at Knightsbridge . Cheap printers of Shoe Lane and Cow Cross ( all pirates ! ) disputed about the copyrights , and published their own editions ; and in the meantime the authors , to have made bread of their song ( it was poor old Homer 's hard ancient case ! ) , must have sung it about the streets . Such is the lot of Literature ! the profits of ‘ Sally Brown ’ were divided by the Ballad Mongers ;— it has cost , but has never brought me , a halfpenny . ” ]</p>

   <note xml:id="note28" place="bottom" n="28">Originally published in 1830 in a thin duodecimo , with illustrations by George Cruikshank . It was while Hood was living at Winchmore Hill that he had the opportunity of noting the chief features of this once famous Civic Revel — the Easter Monday Hunt — even then in its decadence .</note>
   <p>ADVERTISEMENT .</p>
   <p>Striding in the Steps of Strutt — The historian of the old English ports — the author of the following pages has endeavored to record a yearly revel , already fast hastening to decay . The Easter phase will soon be numbered with the pastimes of past times : its dogs will have had their day , and its Deer will be Fallow . A few more seasons , and this City Common Hunt will become uncommon .</p>
   <p>In proof of this melancholy decadance , the ensuing epistle is inserted . It was penned by an underling at the Kells , a person more accustomed to riding than writing :—</p>
   <p>“ Sir ,— About the Hunt . In anser to your Innqueries , their as been a great falling off laterally , so muches this year that there was nobody allmost . We did smear nothing provisionally , hardly a Bottle extra , wich is a proof in Pint . In short our Hunt may be said to be in the last Stag of a decline . ”</p>

     <l n="51">Afore ever you was born , I was well used to things like these ;</l>
     <l n="52">I shall put it in the grate , and let it burn up by degrees .</l>
     <l n="53">So in it goes , and Bounce — O Lord ! it gives us such a rattle ,</l>
     <l n="54">I thought we both were cannonized , like Sogers in a battle !</l>
     <l n="55">Up goes the copper like a squib , and us on both our backs ,</l>
     <l n="56">And bless the tubs , they bundled off , and split all into cracks .</l>
     <l n="57">Well , there I fainted dead away , and might have been cut shorter ,</l>
     <l n="58">But Providence was kind , and brought me to with scalding water .</l>
     <l n="59">I first looks round for Mrs . Round , and sees her at a distance ,</l>
     <l n="60">As stiff as starch , and looked as dead as any thing in existence ;</l>
     <l n="61">All scorched and grimed , and more than that , I sees the copper slap</l>
     <l n="62">Right on her head , for all the world like a percussion copper cap .</l>
     <l n="63">Well , I crooks her little fingers , and crumps them well up together ,</l>
     <l n="64">As humanity pints out , and burnt her nostrums with a feather ;</l>
     <l n="65">But for all as I can do , to restore her to her mortality ,</l>
     <l n="66">She never gives a sign of a return to sensuality .</l>
     <l n="67">Thinks I , well there she lies , as dead as my own late departed mother ,</l>
     <l n="68">Well , she 'll wash no more in this world , whatever she does in t'other .</l>
     <l n="69">So I gives myself to scramble up the linens for a minute ,</l>
     <l n="70">Lawk , sich a shirt ! thinks I , it 's well my master was n't in it ;</l>
     <l n="71">Oh ! I never , never , never , never , never , see a sight so shockin ;</l>
     <l n="72">Here lays a leg , and there a leg — I mean , you know , a stocking —</l>
     <l n="73">Bodies all slit and torn to rags , and many a tattered skirt ,</l>
     <l n="74">And arms burnt off , and sides and backs all scotched and black with dirt ;</l>
     <l n="75">But as nobody was in ‘ em — none but — nobody was hurt !</l>
     <l n="76">Well , there I am , a-scrambling up the things , all in a lump ,</l>
     <l n="77">When , mercy on us ! such a groan as makes my heart to jump .</l>
     <l n="78">And there she is , a-lying with a crazy sort of eye ,</l>
     <l n="79">A-staring at the wash-house roof , laid open to the sky :</l>
     <l n="80">Then she beckons with a finger , and so down to her I reaches ,</l>
     <l n="81">And puts my ear agin her mouth to hear her dying speeches ,</l>
     <l n="82">For , poor soul ! she has a husband and young orphans , as I knew ;</l>
     <l n="83">Well , Ma'am , you wo n't believe it , but it 's Gospel fact and true ,</l>
     <l n="84">But these words is all she whispered — ‘ Why , where is the powder blew ? ’ ”</l>

     <l n="83">I wish you 'd seen him painting her , he hardly took his meals</l>
     <l n="84">Till she was painted on the board , correct from head to heels :</l>
     <l n="85">His heart and soul was in his Cow , and almost made him shabby ,</l>
     <l n="86">He hardly whipped the boys at all ,— or helped to nurse the babby ,</l>
     <l n="87">And when he had her all complete and painted over red ,</l>
     <l n="88">He got so grand , I really thought him going off his head .</l>
     <l n="89">Now hang it , Mr. Hilton , do just hang it anyhow ,</l>
     <l n="90">Poor David , he will hang himself , unless you hang his Cow .</l>
     <l n="91">And if it 's inconvenient and drawn too big by half —</l>

     <l n="6">half ;</l>
     <l n="7">It 's common to all and fed off by nineteen cows , six ponies , three</l>
     <l n="8">horses , five asses , two foals , seven pigs , and a calf !</l>
     <l n="9">Besides a pond in the middle , as is held by a similar sort of common law</l>

     <l n="18">pigsties , and poultry huts , and such-like sheds ,</l>
     <l n="19">With plenty of public-houses — two Foxes , one Green Man , three Bunch of</l>

     <l n="58">you may go and whistle ;</l>
     <l n="59">But the Tailor 's front garden grows two cabbages , a dock , a ha'porth</l>
     <l n="60">of pennyroyal , two dandelions , and a thistle !</l>
     <l n="61">There are three small orchards — Mr. Busby 's the school-master 's is the</l>
     <l n="62">chief —</l>
     <l n="63">With two pear trees that do n't bear ; one plum , and an apple that every</l>
     <l n="64">year is stripped by a thief .</l>
     <l n="65">There 's another small day-school too , kept by the respectable</l>
     <l n="66">Mrs. Gaby ,</l>
     <l n="67">A select establishment for six little boys , and one big , and four</l>

     <l n="69">There 's a rectory with pointed gables and strange odd chimneys that</l>
     <l n="70">never smokes ,</l>
     <l n="71">For the Rector do n't live on his living like other Christian sort of</l>

     <l n="153">For he 's my darlin of darlins , and if he do n't soon</l>
     <l n="154">come back , you 'll see me drop stone dead on the place .</l>
     <l n="155">I only wish I 'd got him safe in these two Motherly</l>
     <l n="156">arms , and would n't I hug him and kiss him !</l>
     <l n="157">Lauk ! I never knew what a precious he was —</l>

     <l n="73">to dance ,</l>
     <l n="74">And Jack in the Green will go in black like mourning for our mischance ;</l>
     <l n="75">If we live as long as May , that 's to say , through the hard winter</l>
     <l n="76">and pinching weather ,</l>
     <l n="77">For I do n't see how we 're to earn enough to keep body and soul together .</l>
     <l n="78">I only wish Mr. Wilberforce , or some of them that pities the niggers ,</l>
     <l n="79">Would take a peep down in our cellars , and look at our miserable starving</l>
     <l n="80">figures ,</l>
     <l n="81">A-sitting idle on our empty sacks , and all ready to eat each other ,</l>
     <l n="82">And a brood of little ones crying for bread to a heartbreaking Father</l>
     <l n="83">and Mother .</l>
     <l n="84">They hav n't a rag of clothes to mend , if their mothers had thread</l>
     <l n="85">and needles ,</l>
     <l n="86">But crawl naked about the cellars , poor things , like a swarm of common</l>
     <l n="87">black beadles .</l>
     <l n="88">If they 'd only inquired before passing the Act , and taken a few such</l>
     <l n="89">peeps ,</l>
     <l n="90">I do n't think that any real gentleman would have set his face against</l>
     <l n="91">sweeps .</l>
     <l n="92">Climbing 's an ancient respectable art , and if History 's of any vally ,</l>
     <l n="93">Was recommended by Queen Elizabeth to the great Sir Walter Raleigh ,</l>
     <l n="94">When he wrote on a pane of glass how I 'd climb , if the way I only knew ,</l>
     <l n="95">And she writ beneath , if your heart 's afeard , do n't venture up the flue .</l>
     <l n="96">As for me I was always loyal , and respected all powers that are higher ,</l>
     <l n="97">But how can I now say God save the King , if I ai n't to be a Cryer ?</l>
     <l n="98">There 's London milk , that 's one of the cries , even on Sunday the law allows ,</l>
     <l n="99">But ought black sweeps , that are human beasts , to be worser off than</l>
     <l n="100">black cows ?</l>
     <l n="101">Do we go calling about , when it 's church time , like the noisy Billingsgate</l>
     <l n="102">vermin ,</l>
     <l n="103">And disturb the parson with “ All alive O ! ” in the middle of a funeral</l>
     <l n="104">sermon ?</l>
     <l n="105">But the fish wo n't keep , not the mackerel wo n't , is the cry of the</l>
     <l n="106">Parliament elves ,</l>
     <l n="107">Everything , except the sweeps I think , is to be allowed to keep themselves !</l>
     <l n="108">Lord help us ! what 's to become of us if we must n't cry no more ?</l>
     <l n="109">We sha n't do for black mutes to go a standing at a death 's door .</l>
     <l n="110">And we sha n't do to emigrate , no not even to the Hottentot nations ,</l>
     <l n="111">For as time wears on , our black will wear off , and then think of our</l>
     <l n="112">situations !</l>
     <l n="113">And we should not do , in lieu of black-a-moor footmen , to serve ladies of</l>
     <l n="114">quality nimbly ,</l>
     <l n="115">For when we were drest in our sky-blue and silver , and large frills , all</l>
     <l n="116">clean and neat , and white silk stockings , if they pleased to desire</l>
     <l n="117">us to sweep the hearth , we could n't resist the chimbley .</l>

     <l n="1">“ Fly to the desert , fly with me . ” — LADY HESTER STANHOPE .</l>
   </lg>
   <note xml:id="note34" place="bottom" n="34">For the purposes of his pun on “ night-mare , ” Hood adroitly utilizes the story of the famous Lady Hester Stanhope , whom Kinglake , in his Eothen , first made familiar to so many of us . He there speaks of the “ quiet women in Somersetshire , ” and their surprise when they learned that “ the intrepid girl who used to break their vicious horses for them ” was reigning over the wandering tribes of Western Asia !</note>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ Twas in the wilds of Lebanon , amongst its barren hills ,—</l>
     <l n="2">To think upon it , even now , my very blood it chills !—</l>
     <l n="3">My sketch-book spread before me , and my pencil in my hand ,</l>
     <l n="4">I gazed upon the mountain range , the red tumultuous sand ,</l>
     <l n="5">The plumy palms , the sombre firs , the cedars tall and proud ,—</l>
     <l n="6">When lo ! a shadow pass 'd across the paper like a cloud ,</l>
     <l n="7">And looking up I saw a form , apt figure for the scene ,</l>
     <l n="8">Methought I stood in presence of some oriental queen !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">The turban on her head was white as any driven snow ;</l>
     <l n="10">A purple bandalette past o'er the lofty brow below ,</l>
     <l n="11">And thence upon her shoulders fell , by either jewell 'd ear ;</l>
     <l n="12">In yellow folds voluminous she wore her long cachemere ;</l>
     <l n="13">Whilst underneath , with ample sleeves , a turkish robe of silk</l>
     <l n="14">Enveloped her in drapery the color of new milk ;</l>
     <l n="15">Yet oft it floated wide in front , disclosing underneath</l>
     <l n="16">A gorgeous Persian tunic , rich with many a broider 'd wreath ,</l>
     <l n="17">Compelled by clasps of costly pearls around her neck to meet —</l>
     <l n="18">And yellow as the amber were the buskins on her feet !</l>
     <l n="19">Of course I bowed my lowest bow — of all the things on earth ,</l>
     <l n="20">The reverence due to loveliness , to rank , or ancient birth ,</l>
     <l n="21">To pow'r , to wealth , to genius , or to anything uncommon ,</l>
     <l n="22">A man should bend the lowest in a Desert to a Woman !</l>
     <l n="23">Yet some strange influence stronger still , though vague and undefin 'd ,</l>
     <l n="24">Compell 'd me , and with magic might subdued my soul and mind ;</l>
     <l n="25">There was a something in her air that drew the spirit nigh ,</l>
     <l n="26">Beyond the common witchery that dwells in woman 's eye !</l>
     <l n="27">With reverence deep , like any slave of that peculiar land ,</l>
     <l n="28">I bowed my forehead to the earth , and kissed the arid sand ;</l>
     <l n="29">And then I touched her garment 's hem , devoutly as a Dervise ,</l>
     <l n="30">Predestinated ( so I felt ) forever to her service .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="31">Nor was I wrong in auguring thus my fortune from her face ,</l>
     <l n="32">She knew me , seemingly , as well as any of her race ;</l>
     <l n="33">“ Welcome ! ” she cried , as I uprose submissive to my feet ;</l>
     <l n="34">“ It was ordained that you and I should in this desert meet !</l>
     <l n="35">Aye , ages since , before thy soul had burst its prison bars ,</l>
     <l n="36">This interview was promis 'd in the language of the stars ! ”</l>
     <l n="37">Then clapping , as the Easterns wont , her all-commanding hands ,</l>
     <l n="38">A score of mounted Arabs came fast spurring o'er the sands ,</l>
     <l n="39">Nor rein 'd they up their foaming steeds till in my very face</l>
     <l n="40">They blew the breath impetuous , and panting from the race .</l>
     <l n="41">“ Fear nought , ” exclaimed the radiant one , as I sprang off aloof ,</l>
     <l n="42">“ Thy precious frame need never fear a blow from horse 's hoof !</l>
     <l n="43">Thy natal star was fortunate as any orb of birth ,</l>
     <l n="44">And fate hath held in store for thee the rarest gift of earth . ”</l>
     <l n="45">Then turning to the dusky men , that humbly waited near ,</l>
     <l n="46">She cried , “ Go bring the BEAUTIFUL — for lo ! the MAN is here ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="47">Off went th ’ obsequious train as swift as Arab hoofs could flee ,</l>
     <l n="48">But Fancy fond outraced them all , with bridle loose and free ,</l>
     <l n="49">And brought me back , for love 's attack , some fair Circassian bride ,</l>
     <l n="50">Or Georgian girl , the Harem 's boast , and fit for sultan 's side ;</l>
     <l n="51">Methought I lifted up her veil , and saw dark eyes beneath ,</l>
     <l n="52">Mild as gazelle 's , a snowy brow , ripe lips , and pearly teeth ,</l>
     <l n="53">A swanlike neck , a shoulder round , full bosom , and a waist</l>
     <l n="54">Not too compact , and rounded limbs , to oriental taste .</l>
     <l n="55">Methought — but here , alas ! alas ! the airy dream to blight ,</l>
     <l n="56">Behold the Arabs leading up a mare of milky white !</l>
     <l n="57">To tell the truth , without reserve , evasion , or remorse ,</l>
     <l n="58">The last of creatures in my love or liking is a horse :</l>
     <l n="59">Whether in early youth some kick untimely laid me flat ,</l>
     <l n="60">Whether from born antipathy , as some dislike a cat ,</l>
     <l n="61">I never yet could bear the kind , from Meux 's giant steeds</l>
     <l n="62">Down to those little bearish cubs of Shetland 's shaggy breeds ;—</l>
     <l n="63">As for a warhorse , he that can bestride one is a hero ,</l>
     <l n="64">Merely to look at such a sight my courage sinks to zero .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="65">With lightning eyes , and thunder mane , and hurricanes of legs ,</l>
     <l n="66">Tempestuous tail — to picture him description vainly begs !</l>
     <l n="67">His fiery nostrils send forth clouds of smoke instead of breath —</l>
     <l n="68">Nay , was it not a Horse that bore the grisly Shape of Death ?</l>
     <l n="69">Judge then how cold an ague-fit of agony was mine</l>
     <l n="70">To see the mistress of my fate , imperious , make a sign</l>
     <l n="71">To which my own foreboding soul the cruel sense supplied :</l>
     <l n="72">“ Mount , happy man , and run away with your Arabian bride ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="73">Grim was the smile , and tremulous the voice with which I spoke ,</l>
     <l n="74">Like any one 's when jesting with a subject not a joke ,</l>
     <l n="75">So men have trifled with the axe before the fatal stroke .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="76">“ Lady , if mine had been the luck in Yorkshire to be born ,</l>
     <l n="77">Or any of its ridings , this would be a blessed morn ;</l>
     <l n="78">But , hapless one ! I cannot ride — there 's something in a horse</l>
     <l n="79">That I can always honor , but I never could endorse —</l>
     <l n="80">To speak still more commercially , in riding I am quite</l>
     <l n="81">Averse to running long , and apt to be paid off at sight :</l>
     <l n="82">In legal phrase , for every class to understand me still ,</l>
     <l n="83">I never was in stirrups yet a tenant but at will ;</l>

     <l n="85">On any horse without ‘ a want of keeping ’ in the saddle .</l>
     <l n="86">In short , ” and here I blush 'd , abash 'd and held my head full low ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="88">The lady smiled , as houris smile , adown from Turkish skies ,</l>
     <l n="89">And beams of cruel kindness shone within her hazel eyes ;</l>
     <l n="90">“ Stranger , ” she said , “ or rather say , my nearest , dearest friend ,</l>
     <l n="91">There 's something in your eyes , your air , and that high instep 's bend ,</l>
     <l n="92">That tells me you 're of Arab race ,— whatever spot of earth ,</l>
     <l n="93">Cheapside , or Bow , or Stepney , had the honor of your birth ,</l>
     <l n="94">The East it is your country ! Like an infant changed to nurse</l>
     <l n="95">By fairies , you have undergone a nurtureship perverse ;</l>
     <l n="96">But this — these desert sands — these palms , and cedars waving wild ,</l>
     <l n="97">All , all , adopt thee as their own — an oriental child —</l>
     <l n="98">The cloud may hide the sun awhile — but soon or late , no doubt ,</l>
     <l n="99">The spirit of your ancestry will burst and sparkle out !</l>
     <l n="100">I read the starry characters — and lo ! ‘ tis written there ,</l>
     <l n="101">Thou wert foredoom 'd of sons of men to ride upon this Mare ,</l>
     <l n="102">A Mare till now was never back 'd by one of mortal mould ,</l>
     <l n="103">Hark , how she neighs , as if for thee she knew that she was foal 'd ! ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="104">And truly — I devoutly wish 'd a blast of the simoom</l>
     <l n="105">Had stifled her !— the Mare herself appeared to mock my doom ;</l>
     <l n="106">With many a bound she caper 'd round and round me like a dance ,</l>
     <l n="107">I feared indeed some wild caress would end the fearful prance ,</l>
     <l n="108">And felt myself , and saw myself — the phantasy was horrid !—</l>
     <l n="109">Like old Redgauntlet , with a shoe imprinted on my forehead !</l>
     <l n="110">On bended knees , with bowing head , and hands uprais 'd in pray'r ,</l>
     <l n="111">I begg 'd the turban 'd Sultaness the issue to forbear ;</l>
     <l n="112">I painted weeping orphan babes , around a widow 'd wife ,</l>

    <head>THE GREEN MAN .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Tom Simpson was as nice a kind of man</l>
     <l n="2">As ever lived — at least at number Four ,</l>
     <l n="3">In Austin Friars , in Mrs. Brown 's first floor ,</l>
     <l n="4">At fifty pounds ,— or thereabouts ,— per ann .</l>
     <l n="5">The Lady reckon 'd him her best of lodgers ,</l>
     <l n="6">His rent so punctually paid each quarter ,—</l>
     <l n="7">He did not smoke like nasty foreign codgers —</l>
     <l n="8">Or play French horns like Mr. Rogers —</l>
     <l n="9">Or talk his flirting nonsense to her daughter .—</l>
     <l n="10">Not that the girl was light behaved or courtable —</l>
     <l n="11">Still on one failing tenderly to touch ,</l>
     <l n="12">The Gentleman did like a drop too much ,</l>
     <l n="13">( Tho ’ there are many such )</l>
     <l n="14">And took more Port than was exactly portable .</l>
     <l n="15">In fact ,— to put the cap upon the nipple ,</l>
     <l n="16">And try the charge ,— Tom certainly did tipple .</l>
     <l n="17">He thought the motto was but sorry stuff</l>
     <l n="18">On Cribb 's Prize Cup — Yes , wrong in ev'ry letter —</l>
     <l n="19">That “ D —— d be he who first cries Hold Enough ! ”</l>
     <l n="20">The more cups hold , and if enough , the better .</l>
     <l n="21">And so to set example in the eyes</l>
     <l n="22">Of Fancy 's lads , and give a broadish hint to them ,</l>
     <l n="23">All his cups were of such ample size</l>
     <l n="24">That he got into them .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="25">Once in the company of merry mates ,</l>
     <l n="26">In spite of Temperance 's if 's and buts ,</l>
     <l n="27">So sure as Eating is set off with plates ,</l>
     <l n="28">His Drinking always was bound up with cuts !</l>
     <l n="29">Howbeit , such Bacchanalian revels</l>
     <l n="30">Bring very sad catastrophes about ;</l>
     <l n="31">Palsy , Dyspepsy , Dropsy , and Blue Devils ,</l>
     <l n="32">Not to forget the Gout .</l>
     <l n="33">Sometimes the liver takes a spleenful whim</l>
     <l n="34">To grow to Strasburg 's regulation size ,</l>
     <l n="35">As if for those hepatical goose pies —</l>
     <l n="36">Or out of depth the head begins to swim —</l>
     <l n="37">Poor Simpson ! what a thing occurred to him !</l>
     <l n="38">‘ Twas Christmas — he had drunk the night before ,—</l>
     <l n="39">Like Baxter , who so “ went beyond his last ” —</l>
     <l n="40">One bottle more , and then one bottle more ,</l>
     <l n="41">Till oh ! the red-wine Ruby-con was pass 'd !</l>
     <l n="42">And homeward , by the short small chimes of day ,</l>
     <l n="43">With many a circumbendibus to spare ,</l>
     <l n="44">For instance , twice round Finsbury Square ,</l>
     <l n="45">To use a fitting phrase , he wound his way .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="46">Then comes the rising , with repentance bitter ,</l>
     <l n="47">And all the nerves — ( and sparrows ) — in a twitter ,</l>
     <l n="48">Till settled by the sober Chinese cup :</l>
     <l n="49">The hands , o'er all , are members that make motions ,</l>
     <l n="50">A sort of wavering , just like the ocean 's ,</l>
     <l n="51">Which has its swell , too , when it 's getting up —</l>
     <l n="52">An awkward circumstance enough for elves</l>
     <l n="53">Who shave themselves ;</l>
     <l n="54">And Simpson just was ready to go thro ’ it ,</l>
     <l n="55">When lo ! the first short glimpse within the glass —</l>
     <l n="56">He jump 'd — and who alive would fail to do it ?—</l>
     <l n="57">To see however it had come to pass ,</l>
     <l n="58">One section of his face as green as grass !</l>
     <l n="59">In vain each eager wipe ,</l>
     <l n="60">With soap — without — wet — hot or cold — or dry ,</l>
     <l n="61">Still , still , and still , to his astonished eye</l>
     <l n="62">One cheek was green , the other cherry ripe !</l>
     <l n="63">Plump in the nearest chair he sat him down ,</l>
     <l n="64">Quaking , and quite absorb 'd in a deep study ,—</l>
     <l n="65">But verdant and not brown ,—</l>
     <l n="66">What could have happened to a tint so ruddy ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="67">Indeed it was a very novel case ,</l>
     <l n="68">By way of penalty for being jolly ,</l>
     <l n="69">To have that evergreen stuck in his face ,</l>
     <l n="70">Just like the windows with their Christmas holly .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="71">“ All claret marks , ” — thought he — Tom knew his forte —</l>
     <l n="72">“ Are red — this color CANNOT come from Port ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="73">One thing was plain ; with such a face as his ,</l>
     <l n="74">‘ Twas quite impossible to ever greet</l>
     <l n="75">Good Mrs. Brown ; nay , any party meet ,</l>
     <l n="76">Altho ’ ‘ twas such a parti-colored phiz !</l>
     <l n="77">As for the public , fancy Sarcy Ned ,</l>
     <l n="78">The coachman , flying , dog-like , at his head ,</l>
     <l n="79">With “ Ax your pardon , Sir , but if you please —</l>
     <l n="80">Unless it comes too high —</l>
     <l n="81">Vere ought a feller , now , to go to buy</l>
     <l n="82">The t'other half , Sir , of that ‘ ere green cheese ? ”</l>
     <l n="83">His mind recoil 'd — so he tied up his head ,</l>
     <l n="84">As with a raging tooth , and took to bed ;</l>
     <l n="85">Of course with feelings far from the serene ,</l>
     <l n="86">For all his future prospects seemed to be ,</l>
     <l n="87">To match his customary tea ,</l>
     <l n="88">Black , mixt with green .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="89">Meanwhile , good Mrs. Brown</l>
     <l n="90">Wondered at Mr. S. not coming down ,</l>
     <l n="91">And sent the maid up-stairs to learn the why ;</l>
     <l n="92">To whom poor Simpson , half delirious ,</l>
     <l n="93">Returned an answer so mysterious</l>
     <l n="94">That curiosity began to fry ;</l>
     <l n="95">The more , as Betty , who had caught a snatch</l>
     <l n="96">By peeping in upon the patient 's bed ,</l>
     <l n="97">Reported a most bloody , tied-up head ,</l>
     <l n="98">Got over-night of course — “ Harm watch , harm catch , ”</l>
     <l n="99">From Watchmen in a boxing-match .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="100">So , liberty or not ,—</l>
     <l n="101">Good lodgers are too scarce to let them off in</l>
     <l n="102">A suicidal coffin —</l>
     <l n="103">The dame ran up as fast as she could trot ;</l>
     <l n="104">Appearance ,— “ fiddle-sticks ! ” should not deter</l>
     <l n="105">From going to the bed ,</l>
     <l n="106">And looking at the head :</l>
     <l n="107">“ La ! Mister S ——, he need not care for her !</l>
     <l n="108">A married woman that had had</l>
     <l n="109">Nine boys and gals , and none had turned out bad —</l>
     <l n="110">Her own dear late would come home late at night ,</l>
     <l n="111">And liquor always got him in a fight .</l>
     <l n="112">She 'd been in hospitals — she would n't faint</l>
     <l n="113">At gores and gashes fingers wide and deep ;</l>
     <l n="114">She knew what 's good for bruises and what ai n't —</l>
     <l n="115">Turlington 's Drops she made a pint to keep .</l>
     <l n="116">Cases she 'd seen beneath the surgent 's hand —</l>
     <l n="117">Such skulls japann 'd — she meant to say trepann 'd !</l>
     <l n="118">Poor wretches ! you would think they 'd been in battle ,</l>
     <l n="119">And had n't hours to live ,</l>
     <l n="120">From tearing horses ’ kicks or Smithfield cattle ,</l>
     <l n="121">Shamefully over-driv !—</l>
     <l n="122">Heads forced to have a silver plate atop ,</l>
     <l n="123">To get the brains to stop .</l>
     <l n="124">At imputations of the legs she 'd been ,</l>
     <l n="125">And neither screech 'd nor cried — ”</l>
     <l n="126">Hereat she pluck 'd the white cravat aside ,</l>
     <l n="127">And lo ! the whole phenomenon was seen —</l>
     <l n="128">“ Preserve us all ! He 's going to gangrene ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="129">Alas ! through Simpson 's brain</l>
     <l n="130">Shot the remark , like ball , with mortal pain ;</l>
     <l n="131">It tallied truly with his own misgiving ,</l>
     <l n="132">And brought a groan ,</l>
     <l n="133">To move a heart of stone —</l>
     <l n="134">A sort of farewell to the land of living !</l>
     <l n="135">And as the case was imminent and urgent ,</l>
     <l n="136">He did not make a shadow of objection</l>
     <l n="137">To Mrs . B . ' s proposal for a “ surgent , ”</l>
     <l n="138">But merely gave a sigh of deep dejection ,</l>
     <l n="139">While down the verdant cheek a tear of grief</l>
     <l n="140">Stole , like a dew-drop on a cabbage-leaf .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="141">Swift flew the summons ,— it was life or death !</l>
     <l n="142">And in as short a time as he could race it ,</l>
     <l n="143">Came Doctor Puddicome , as short of breath ,</l>
     <l n="144">To try his Latin charms against Hic Jacet .</l>
     <l n="145">He took a seat beside the patient 's bed ,</l>
     <l n="146">Saw tongue — felt pulse — examined the bad cheek ,—</l>
     <l n="147">Poked , strok 'd , pinch 'd , kneaded it — hemm 'd —</l>
     <l n="148">shook his head —</l>
     <l n="149">Took a long solemn pause the cause to seek ,</l>
     <l n="150">( Thinking , it seem 'd in Greek ,)</l>
     <l n="151">Then ask 'd — ‘ twas Christmas — “ Had he eaten grass ,</l>
     <l n="152">Or greens — and if the cook was so improper</l>
     <l n="153">To boil them up with copper ,</l>
     <l n="154">Or farthings made of brass ;</l>
     <l n="155">Or if he drank his Hock from dark green glass ,</l>
     <l n="156">Or dined at City Festivals , whereat</l>
     <l n="157">There 's turtle , and green fat ? ”</l>
     <l n="158">To all of which , with serious tone of woe ,</l>
     <l n="159">Poor Simpson answered “ No , ”</l>
     <l n="160">Indeed he might have said in form auricular ,</l>
     <l n="161">Supposing Puddicome had been a monk —</l>
     <l n="162">He had not eaten ( he had only drunk )</l>
     <l n="163">Of anything “ Particular . ”</l>
     <l n="164">The Doctor was at fault ;</l>
     <l n="165">A thing so new quite brought him to a halt .</l>
     <l n="166">Cases of other colors came in crowds ,</l>
     <l n="167">He could have found their remedy , and soon ;</l>
     <l n="168">But green — it sent him up among the clouds ,</l>

    <head>RURAL FELICITY .</head>
    <head>Well , the country 's a pleasant place , sure enough , for people that 's country born , And useful , no doubt , in a natural way , for growing our grass and our corn . It was kindly meant of my cousin Giles , to write and invite me down , Tho ’ as yet all I 've seen of a pastoral life only makes one more partial to town .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">At first I thought I was really come down into</l>
     <l n="2">all sorts of rural bliss ,</l>
     <l n="3">For Porkington Place , with its cows and its pigs ,</l>
     <l n="4">and its poultry , looks not much amiss ;</l>
     <l n="5">There 's something about a dairy farm , with its</l>
     <l n="6">different kinds of live stock ,</l>
     <l n="7">That puts one in mind of Paradise , and Adam</l>
     <l n="8">and his innocent flock ;</l>
     <l n="9">But somehow the good old Elysium fields have</l>
     <l n="10">not been well handed down ,</l>
     <l n="11">And as yet I have found no fields to prefer to dear</l>
     <l n="12">Leicester Fields up in town .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">To be sure it is pleasant to walk in the meads ,</l>
     <l n="14">and so I should like for miles ,</l>
     <l n="15">If it was n't for clodpoles of carpenters that put</l>
     <l n="16">up such crooked stiles ;</l>
     <l n="17">For the bars jut out , and you must jut out , till</l>
     <l n="18">you 're almost broken in two ,</l>
     <l n="19">If you clamber you 're certain sure of a fall , and</l>
     <l n="20">you stick if you try to creep through .</l>
     <l n="21">Of course , in the end , one learns how to climb</l>
     <l n="22">without constant tumbles down ,</l>
     <l n="23">But still as to walking so stylishly , it 's pleasanter</l>
     <l n="24">done about town .</l>
     <l n="25">There 's a way , I know , to avoid the stiles , and</l>
     <l n="26">that 's by a walk in a lane ,</l>
     <l n="27">And I did find a very nice shady one , but I never</l>
     <l n="28">dared go again ;</l>
     <l n="29">For who should I meet but a rampaging bull , that</l>
     <l n="30">would n't be kept in the pound ,</l>
     <l n="31">A trying to toss the whole world at once , by sticking</l>
     <l n="32">his horns in the ground ?</l>
     <l n="33">And that , by the bye , is another thing , that pulls</l>
     <l n="34">rural pleasures down ,</l>
     <l n="35">Ev'ry day in the country is cattle-day , and there 's</l>
     <l n="36">only two up in town .</l>
     <l n="37">Then I 've rose with the sun , to go brushing away</l>
     <l n="38">at the first early pearly dew ,</l>
     <l n="39">And to meet Aurory , or whatever 's her name , and</l>
     <l n="40">I always got wetted through ;</l>
     <l n="41">My shoes are like sops , and I caught a bad cold ,</l>
     <l n="42">and a nice draggle-tail to my gown ,</l>
     <l n="43">That 's not the way that we bathe our feet , or</l>

     <l n="51">One may walk long enough without hats branching</l>
     <l n="52">off , or losing one 's bows about town .</l>
     <l n="53">But worse than that , in a long rural walk , suppose</l>
     <l n="54">that it blows up for rain ,</l>
     <l n="55">And all at once you discover yourself in a real St .</l>
     <l n="56">Swithin 's Lane ;</l>
     <l n="57">And while you 're running all ducked and drown 'd ,</l>
     <l n="58">and pelted with sixpenny drops ,</l>

     <l n="68">return by the shortest cuts .</l>
     <l n="69">Short cuts , indeed ! But it 's nuts to them , to get</l>
     <l n="70">a poor lustyish aunt</l>
     <l n="71">To scramble through gaps or jump over a</l>
     <l n="72">ditch , when they 're morally certain she can n't ,—</l>
     <l n="73">For whenever I get in some awkward scrape , and</l>

     <l n="77">There 's the other day , for my sight is short , and</l>
     <l n="78">I saw what was green beyond ,</l>
     <l n="79">And thought it was all terry firmer and grass till</l>
     <l n="80">I walked in the duckweed pond :</l>
     <l n="81">Or perhaps when I 've pully-hauled up a bank</l>
     <l n="82">they see me come launching down ,</l>
     <l n="83">As none but a stout London female can do as is</l>
     <l n="84">come a first time out of town .</l>
     <l n="85">Then how sweet , some say , on a mossy bank a</l>
     <l n="86">verdurous seat to find ,</l>
     <l n="87">But for my part I always found it a joy that</l>
     <l n="88">brought a repentance behind ;</l>
     <l n="89">For the juicy grass with its nasty green has stained</l>
     <l n="90">a whole breadth of my gown —</l>
     <l n="91">And when gowns are dyed , I need n't say , it 's</l>
     <l n="92">much better done up in town .</l>
     <l n="93">As for country fare , the first morning I came I</l>
     <l n="94">heard such a shrill piece of work !</l>
     <l n="95">And ever since — and it 's ten days ago — we 've lived</l>
     <l n="96">upon nothing but pork ;</l>
     <l n="97">One Sunday except , and then I turn 'd sick , a</l>
     <l n="98">plague take all countrified cooks !</l>
     <l n="99">Why did n't they tell me , before I had dined , they</l>
     <l n="100">made pigeon pies of the rooks ?</l>
     <l n="101">Then the gooseberry wine , tho ’ it 's pleasant when</l>
     <l n="102">up , it does n't agree when it 's down ,</l>
     <l n="103">But it served me right like a gooseberry fool to</l>
     <l n="104">look for champagne out of town !</l>
     <l n="105">To be sure cousin G. meant it all for the best</l>
     <l n="106">when he started this pastoral plan ,</l>
     <l n="107">And his wife is a worthy domestical soul and she</l>
     <l n="108">teaches me all that she can ,</l>
     <l n="109">Such as making of cheese , and curing of hams ,</l>
     <l n="110">but I 'm sure that I never shall learn ,</l>
     <l n="111">And I 've fetched more back-ache than butter as</l>
     <l n="112">yet by chumping away at the churn ;</l>
     <l n="113">But in making hay , tho ’ it 's tanning work , I</l>
     <l n="114">found it more easy to make ,</l>
     <l n="115">But it tries one 's legs , and no great relief when</l>
     <l n="116">you 're tired to sit down on the rake .</l>
     <l n="117">I 'd a country dance too at harvest home , with a</l>
     <l n="118">regular country clown ,</l>
     <l n="119">But , Lord ! they do n't hug one round the waist</l>
     <l n="120">and give one such smacks in town !</l>
     <l n="121">Then I 've tried to make friends with the birds</l>
     <l n="122">and the beasts , but they take to such curious rigs ,</l>
     <l n="123">I 'm always at odds with the turkey-cock , and I</l>
     <l n="124">can n't even please the pigs .</l>
     <l n="125">The very hens pick holes in my hands when I</l>
     <l n="126">grope for the new-laid eggs ,</l>
     <l n="127">And the gander comes hissing out of the pond</l>
     <l n="128">on purpose to flap at my legs .</l>
     <l n="129">I 've been bump 'd in a ditch by the cow without</l>
     <l n="130">horns , and the old sow trampled me down ,</l>
     <l n="131">The beasts are as vicious as any wild beasts — but</l>
     <l n="132">they 're kept in cages in town !</l>
     <l n="133">Another thing is the nasty dogs — thro ’ the village</l>
     <l n="134">I hardly can stir</l>
     <l n="135">Since giving a bumpkin a pint of beer just to call</l>
     <l n="136">off a barking cur ;</l>
     <l n="137">And now you would swear all the dogs in the</l>
     <l n="138">place were set on to hunt me down ,</l>
     <l n="139">But neither the brutes nor the people I think are</l>
     <l n="140">as civilly bred as in town .</l>
     <l n="141">Last night about twelve I was scared broad awake ,</l>
     <l n="142">and all in a tremble of fright ,</l>
     <l n="143">But instead of a family murder it proved an owl</l>
     <l n="144">that flies screeching at night .</l>
     <l n="145">Then there 's plenty of ricks and stacks all</l>
     <l n="146">about , and I can n't help dreaming of Swing —</l>
     <l n="147">In short , I think that a plastoral life is not the</l>
     <l n="148">most happiest thing ;</l>
     <l n="149">For besides all the troubles I 've mentioned before</l>
     <l n="150">as endur 'd for rurality 's sake ,</l>
     <l n="151">I 've been stung by the bees , and I 've set among</l>
     <l n="152">ants , and once — ugh ! I trod on a snake !</l>
     <l n="153">And as to moskitoes they tortured me so , for I 've</l>
     <l n="154">got a particular skin ,</l>
     <l n="155">I do think it 's the gnats coming out of the ponds</l>
     <l n="156">that drives the poor suicides in !</l>
     <l n="157">And after all a n't there new-laid eggs to be had</l>
     <l n="158">upon Holborn Hill ?</l>
     <l n="159">And dairy-fed pork in Broad St. Giles 's , and fresh</l>
     <l n="160">butter wherever you will ?</l>
     <l n="161">And a covered cart that brings Cottage Bread</l>
     <l n="162">quite rustical-like and brown ?</l>
     <l n="163">So one is n't so very uncountrified in the very</l>
     <l n="164">heart of the town .</l>
     <l n="165">Howsomever my mind 's made up , and although</l>
     <l n="166">I 'm sure cousin Giles will be vext ,</l>
     <l n="167">I mean to book me an inside place up to town</l>
     <l n="168">upon Saturday next ,</l>
     <l n="169">And if nothing happens , soon after ten , I shall</l>
     <l n="170">be at the Old Bell and Crown ,</l>
     <l n="171">And perhaps I may come to the country again ,</l>
     <l n="172">when London is all burnt down !</l>

     <l n="1">On Hounslow Heath — and close beside the road ,</l>
     <l n="2">As western travellers may oft have seen ,—</l>
     <l n="3">A little house some years ago there stood ,</l>
     <l n="4">A minikin abode ;</l>
     <l n="5">And built like Mr. Birkbeck 's , all of wood :</l>
     <l n="6">The walls of white , the window-shutters green ,—</l>
     <l n="7">Four wheels it had at North , South , East , and West</l>
     <l n="8">( Though now at rest ) ,</l>
     <l n="9">On which it used to wander to and fro ,</l>
     <l n="10">Because its master ne'er maintained a rider ,</l>
     <l n="11">Like those who trade in Paternoster Row ;</l>
     <l n="12">But made his business travel for itself ,</l>
     <l n="13">Till he had made his pelf ,</l>
     <l n="14">And then retired — if one may call it so ,</l>
     <l n="15">Of a roadsider .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="16">Perchance , the very race and constant riot</l>

     <l n="18">Made him more relish the repose and quiet</l>
     <l n="19">Of his now sedentary caravan ;</l>

     <l n="46">And being easily melted in their dotage ,</l>
     <l n="47">Slobber 'd ,— and kept</l>

     <l n="84">Right o'er the page ,</l>

     <l n="114">There was no house — no villa there — no nothing !</l>
     <l n="115">No house !</l>
     <l n="116">The change was quite amazing ;</l>
     <l n="117">It made her senses stagger for a minute ,</l>
     <l n="118">The riddle 's explication seemed to harden ;</l>
     <l n="119">But soon her superannuated nous</l>
     <l n="120">Explain 'd the horrid mystery ;— and raising</l>
     <l n="121">Her hand to heaven , with the cabbage in it ,</l>

     <l n="2">Lord help my Lady !— what a smash !— if you had only heard her sob !</l>
     <l n="3">It was all through Mr. Lambert : but for certain he was winey ,</l>
     <l n="4">To think for to go to sit down on a table full of Chiney .</l>
     <l n="5">“ Deuce take your stupid head ! ” says my Lady to his very face ;</l>
     <l n="6">But politeness , you know , is nothing when there 's Chiney in the case ;</l>
     <l n="7">And if ever a woman was fond of Chiney to a passion ,</l>
     <l n="8">It 's my mistress , and all sorts of it , whether new or old fashion .</l>
     <l n="9">Her brother 's a sea-captain , and brings her home shiploads —</l>
     <l n="10">Such bronzes , and such dragons , and nasty squatting things like toads ;</l>
     <l n="11">And great nidnoddin ’ mandarins , with palsies in the head :</l>
     <l n="12">I declare I 've often dreamt of them , and had nightmares in my bed .</l>
     <l n="13">But the frightfuller they are — lawk ! she loves them all the better ,</l>
     <l n="14">She 'd have Old Nick himself made of Chiney if they 'd let her .</l>
     <l n="15">Lawk-a-mercy ! break her Chiney , and it 's breaking her very heart ;</l>
     <l n="16">If I touched it , she would very soon say , “ Mary , we must part . ”</l>
     <l n="17">To be sure she is unlucky : only Friday comes Master Randall ,</l>
     <l n="18">And breaks a broken spout , and fresh chips a tea-cup handle :</l>
     <l n="19">He 's a dear , sweet little child , but he will so finger and touch ,</l>
     <l n="20">And that 's why my Lady does n't take to children much .</l>

     <l n="22">Must go and sit down on the Dresd'n shepherdesses ’ laps ,</l>
     <l n="23">As if there was no such things as rosewood chairs in the room !</l>

     <l n="31">I 'm very much mistook if Mr. Lambert 's will be a catch ;</l>
     <l n="32">The breaking the Chiney will be the breaking-off of his own match .</l>

     <l n="35">Lawk ! I never saw a man in all my life in such a taking ;</l>
     <l n="36">I could find it in my heart to pity him for all his mischief-making .</l>
     <l n="37">To see him stand a-hammering and stammering like a zany ;</l>
     <l n="38">But what signifies apologies , if they wo n't mend old Chaney !</l>
     <l n="39">If he sent her up whole crates full , from Wedgwood 's and Mr. Spode 's ,</l>
     <l n="40">He could n't make amends for the crack 'd mandarins and smash 'd toads .</l>

     <l n="56">I 'll look in twice a day , just to see , like , how they mend .</l>
     <l n="57">To be sure it is a sight that might draw tears from dogs and cats ,</l>
     <l n="58">Here 's this pretty little pagoda , now , has lost four of its cocked hats .</l>
     <l n="59">Be particular with the pagoda : and then here 's this pretty bowl —</l>
     <l n="60">The Chinese Prince is making love to nothing because of this hole ;</l>
     <l n="61">And here 's another Chinese man , with a face just like a doll ,</l>
     <l n="62">Do stick his pigtail on again , and just mend his parasol .</l>
     <l n="63">But I need n't tell you what to do , only do it out of hand ,</l>
     <l n="64">And charge whatever you like to charge — my Lady wo n't make a stand .</l>
     <l n="65">Well ! good-morning , Mr. What-d'yehYpppHeNcall , for it 's time our gossip ended :</l>

   <note xml:id="note44" place="bottom" n="44">This Poem was doubtless one of the results of Hood 's residence in Germany . It is suggested apparently in about equal proportions by the Walpurgis-night in Faust , and Schiller 's Gang nach dem Eisenhammer . Possibly Hood had been stirred up to the attempt by Retzsch 's outlines . He has mixed up localities with the utmost freedom , the Harz , the Black Forest , and the Scene of Schiller 's Poem . The influence of the Ingoldsby Legends is obvious throughout .</note>

The candidates , it will be remembered , were Isaac Williams and Mr. ( afterwards Archdeacon ) Garbett . The struggle was the more intense that it was openly acknowledged to be a trial of strength between the adherents of the “ Oxford Movement ” and the Evangelical Party .</note>

     <l n="94">To agitate society and loosen all its screws ;</l>
     <l n="95">And which all may be agreeable and proper to their spheres ,—</l>
     <l n="96">But it 's not the thing for musicals to set us by the ears .</l>
     <l n="97">And as to College larning , my opinion for to broach ,</l>
     <l n="98">And I 've had it from my cousin , and he driv a college coach ,</l>
     <l n="99">And so knows the University , and all as there belongs ,</l>
     <l n="100">And he says that Oxford 's famouser for sausages than songs ,</l>
     <l n="101">And seldom turns a poet out like Hudson that can chant ,</l>
     <l n="102">As well as make such ditties as the Free and Easies want ,</l>
     <l n="103">Or other Tavern Melodists I can n't just call to mind —</l>
     <l n="104">But it 's not the classic system for to propagate the kind ,</l>
     <l n="105">Whereby it so may happen as that neither of them Scholars</l>
     <l n="106">May be the proper Chairman for the Glorious Apollers !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="107">For my part in the matter , if so be I had a voice ,</l>
     <l n="108">It 's the best among the vocalists I 'd honor with the choice ;</l>
     <l n="109">Or a Poet as could furnish a new Ballad to the bunch ;</l>
     <l n="110">Or at any rate the surest hand at mixing of the punch ;</l>
     <l n="111">‘ Cause why , the members meet for that and other tuneful frolics —</l>
     <l n="112">And not to say , like Muffincaps , their Catichiz and Collec 's .</l>
     <l n="113">But you see them there Itinerants that preach so long and loud ,</l>
     <l n="114">And always takes advantage like the prigs of any crowd ,</l>
     <l n="115">Have brought their jangling voices , and as far as they can compass ,</l>
     <l n="116">Have turn 'd a tavern shindy to a seriouser rumpus ,</l>
     <l n="117">And him as knows most hymns — altho ’ I can n't see how it follers —</l>
     <l n="118">They want to be the Chairman of the Glorious Apollers !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="119">Well , that 's the row — and who can guess the upshot after all ?</l>
     <l n="120">Whether Harmony will ever make the “ Arms ” her House of call ,</l>
     <l n="121">Or whether this here mobbing — as some longish heads foretell it ,</l>
     <l n="122">Will grow to such a riot that the Oxford Blues must quell it ,</l>
     <l n="123">Howsomever , for the present , there 's no sign of any peace ,</l>
     <l n="124">For the hubbub keeps a-growing , and defies the New Police ;—</l>
     <l n="125">But if I was in the Vestry , and a leading sort of Man ,</l>
     <l n="126">Or a Member of the Vocals , to get backers for my plan ,</l>
     <l n="127">Why , I 'd settle all the squabble in the twinkle of a needle ,</l>
     <l n="128">For I 'd have another candidate — and that 's the Parish Beadle ,</l>
     <l n="129">Who makes such lots of Poetry , himself , or else by proxy ,</l>
     <l n="130">And no one never has no doubts about his orthodoxy ;</l>
     <l n="131">Whereby — if folks was wise — instead of either of them Scholars ,</l>
     <l n="132">And straining their own lungs along of contradictious hollers ,</l>
     <l n="133">They 'll lend their ears to reason , and take my advice as follers ,</l>
     <l n="134">Namely — Bumble for the Chairman of the Glorious Apollers !</l>
