    <head>APPENDIX OF POEMS ETC . IN SCHILLER 'S DRAMATIC WORKS .</head>
    <p n="1">APPENDIX .</p>
    <p n="2">The following variations appear in the first two verses of Hector 's Farewell , as given in The Robbers , act ii . scene 2 .</p>
    <p n="3">ANDROMACHE . Wilt thou , Hector , leave me ?— leave me weeping , Where Achilles ’ murderous blade is heaping Bloody offerings on Patroclus ’ grave ? Who , alas , will teach thine infant truly Spears to hurl , the gods to honor duly , When thou'rt buried ‘ neath dark Xanthus ’ wave ?</p>
    <p n="4">HECTOR . Dearest wife , go ,— fetch my death-spear glancing , Let me join the battle-dance entrancing , For my shoulders bear the weight of Troy ! Heaven will be our Astyanax ’ protector ! Falling as his country 's savior , Hector Soon will greet thee in the realms of joy .</p>
    <p n="5">The following additional verse is found in Amalia 's Song , as sung in The Robbers , act iii . scene 1 . It is introduced between the first and second verses , as they appear in poems .</p>
    <p n="6">His embrace — what maddening rapture bound us ! Bosom throbbed ‘ gainst bosom with wild might ; Mouth and ear were chained — night reigned around us — And the spirit winged toward heaven its flight .</p>
    <p n="7">From The Robbers , act iv . scene 5 .</p>
    <p n="8">CHORUS OF ROBBERS . What so good for banishing sorrow As women , theft , and bloody affray ? We must dance in the air to-morrow , Therefore let 's be right merry to-day !</p>
    <p n="9">A free and jovial life we 've led , Ever since we began it . Beneath the tree we make our bed , We ply our task when the storm 's o'erhead And deem the moon our planet . The fellow we swear by is Mercury , A capital hand at our trade is he .</p>
    <p n="10">To-day we become the guests of a priest , A rich farmer to-morrow must feed us ; And as for the future , we care not the least , But leave it to heaven to heed us .</p>
    <p n="11">And when our throats with a vintage rare We 've long enough been supplying , Fresh courage and strength we drink in there , And with the evil one friendship swear , Who down in hell is frying .</p>
    <p n="12">The groans o'er fathers reft of breath , The sorrowing mothers ’ cry of death , Deserted brides ’ sad sobs and tears . Are sweetest music to our ears .</p>
    <p n="13">Ha ! when under the axe each one quivering lies , When they bellow like calves , and fall round us like flies , Naught gives such pleasure to our sight , It fills our ears with wild delight . And when arrives the fatal day The devil straight may fetch us ! Our fee we get without delay — They instantly Jack-Ketch us . One draught upon the road of liquor bright and clear , And hip ! hip ! hip ; hurrah ! we 're seen no longer here !</p>
    <p n="14">From The Robbers , act iv . scene 5 .</p>
    <p n="15">MOOR 'S SONG .</p>
    <p n="16">BRUTUS . Ye are welcome , peaceful realms of light ! Oh , receive Rome 's last-surviving son ! From Philippi , from the murderous fight , Come I now , my race of sorrow run .— Cassius , where art thou ?— Rome overthrown ! All my brethren 's loving band destroyed ! Safety find I at death 's door alone , And the world to Brutus is a void !</p>
    <p n="17">CAESAR . Who now , with the ne'erhYpppHeNsubduedhYpppHeNone ' s tread , Hither from yon rocks makes haste to come ?— Ha ! if by no vision I 'm misled , ‘ Tis the footstep of a child of Rome .— Son of Tiber — whence dost thou appear ? Stands the seven-hilled city as of yore Oft her orphaned lot awakes my tear , For alas , her Caesar is no more ?</p>
    <p n="18">BRUTUS . Ha ! thou with the three-and-twenty wounds ! Who hath , dead one , summoned thee to light ? Back to gaping Orcus ’ fearful bonds , Haughty mourner ! triumph not to-night ! On Philippi 's iron altar , lo ! Reeks now freedom 's final victim 's blood ; Rome o'er Brutus ’ bier feels her death-throe ,— He seeks Minos .— Back to thy dark flood !</p>
    <p n="19">CAESAR . Oh , the death-stroke Brutus ’ sword then hurled ! Thou , too — Brutus — thou ? Could this thing be ? Son ! It was thy father !— Son ! the world Would have fallen heritage to thee ! Go — ‘ mongst Romans thou art deemed immortal , For thy steel hath pierced thy father 's breast . Go — and shout it even to yon portal : “ Brutus is ‘ mongst Romans deemed immortal , For his steel hath pierced his father 's breast . ” Go — thou knowest now what on Lethe 's strand Made me a prisoner stand .— Now , grim steersman , push thy bark from land !</p>
    <p n="20">BRUTUS . Father , stay !— In all earth 's realms so fair , It hath been my lot to know but one , Who with mighty Caesar could compare ; And of yore thou called'st him thy son . None but Caesar could a Rome o'erthrow , Brutus only made great Caesar fear ; Where lives Brutus , Caesar 's blood must flow ; If thy path lies yonder , mine is here .</p>
    <p n="21">From Wallenstein 's Camp , scene 1 .</p>
    <p n="22">RECRUIT 'S SONG .</p>
    <p n="23">How sweet the wild sound Of drum and of fife ! To roam o'er earth 's round , Lead a wandering life , With steed trained aright , And bold for the fight , With a sword by the side , To rove far and wide ,— Quick , nimble , and free As the finch that we see On bushes and trees , Or braving the breeze ,— Huzza , then ! the Friedlander 's banner for me !</p>
    <p n="24">From Wallenstein 's Camp , scene the last .</p>
    <p n="25">SECOND CUIRASSIER sings . Up , up , my brave comrades ! to horse ! to horse ! Let us haste to the field and to freedom ! To the field , for ‘ tis there that is proved our hearts ’ force , ‘ Tis there that in earnest we need ‘ em ! None other can there our places supply , Each must stand alone ,— on himself must rely .</p>
    <p n="26">CHORUS . None other can there our places supply , Each must stand alone ,— on himself must rely .</p>
    <p n="27">DRAGOON . Now freedom appears from the world to have flown , None but lords and their vassals one traces ; While falsehood and cunning are ruling alone O'er the living cowardly races . The man who can look upon death without fear — The soldier ,— is now the sole freeman left here .</p>
    <p n="28">CHORUS . The man who can look upon death without fear — The soldier ,— is now the sole freeman left here .</p>
    <p n="29">FIRST YAGER . The cares of this life , he casts them away , Untroubled by fear or by sorrow ; He rides to his fate with a countenance gay , And finds it to-day or to-morrow ; And if ‘ tis to-morrow , to-day we 'll employ To drink full deep of the goblet of joy ,</p>
    <p n="30">CHORUS . And if ‘ tis to-morrow , to-day we 'll employ To drink full deep of the goblet of joy . [ They refill their glasses and drink .</p>
    <p n="31">CAVALRY SERGEANT . The skies o'er him shower his lot filled with mirth , He gains , without toil , its full measure ; The peasant , who grubs in the womb of the earth , Believes that he 'll find there the treasure , Through lifetime he shovels and digs like a slave , And digs — till at length he has dug his own grave .</p>
    <p n="32">CHORUS . Through lifetime he shovels and digs like a slave , And digs — till at length he has dug his own grave .</p>
    <p n="33">FIRST YAGER . The horseman , as well as his swift-footed beast , Are guests by whom all are affrighted , When glimmer the lamps at the wedding feast , In the banquet he joins uninvited ; He woos not long , and with gold he ne'er buys , But carries by storm love 's blissful prize .</p>
    <p n="34">CHORUS . He woos not long , and with gold he ne'er buys , But carries by storm love 's blissful prize .</p>
    <p n="35">SECOND CUIRASSIER . Why weeps the maiden ? Why sorrows she so ? Let me hence , let me hence , girl , I pray thee ? The soldier on earth no sure quarters can know , With true love he ne'er can repay thee . Fate hurries him onward with fury blind , His peace he never can leave behind .</p>
    <p n="36">CHORUS . Fate hurries him onward with fury blind , His peace he can never leave behind ,</p>
    <p n="37">FIRST YAGER . ( Taking his two neighbors by the hand . The rest do the same , forming a large semi-circle . ) Away , then , my comrades , our chargers let 's mount ! In the battle the bosom bounds lightly ! Youth boils , and life 's goblet still foams at the fount , Away ! while the spirit glows brightly ! Unless ye have courage your life to stake , That life ye never your own can make !</p>
    <p n="38">CHORUS . Unless ye have courage your life to stake , That life ye never your own can make !</p>
    <p n="39">From William Tell , act i. scene 1 .</p>
    <p n="40">SCENE — The high rocky shore of the Lake of Lucerne , opposite Schwytz .</p>
    <p n="41">The lake forms an inlet in the land ; a cottage is near the shore ; a fisher-boy is rowing in a boat . Beyond the lake are seen the green pastures , the villages and farms of Schwytz glowing in the sunshine . On the left of the spectator are the peaks of the Hacken , enveloped in clouds ; on his right , in the distance , are seen the glaciers . Before the curtain rises the RANZ DES VACHES , and the musical sound of the cattle-bells are heard , and continue also for some time after the scene opens .</p>
    <p n="42">FISHER-BOY ( sings in his boat ) . AIR — Ranz des Vaches .</p>
    <p n="43">Bright smiles the lake , as it woos to its deep ,— A boy on its margin of green lies asleep ; Then hears he a strain , Like the flute 's gentle note , Sweet as voices of angels In Eden that float . And when he awakens , with ecstasy blest , The waters are playing all over his breast , From the depths calls a voice “ Dearest child , with me go ! I lure down the sleeper , I draw him below . ”</p>
    <p n="44">HERDSMAN ( on the mountain ) . AIR — Variation of the Ranz des Vaches .</p>
    <p n="45">Ye meadows , farewell ! Ye pastures so glowing ! The herdsman is going , For summer has fled ! We depart to the mountain ; we 'll come back again , When the cuckoo is calling ,— when wakens the strain ,— When the earth is tricked out with her flowers so gay , When the stream sparkles bright in the sweet month of May . Ye meadows , farewell ! Ye pastures so glowing ! The herdsman is going , For summer has fled !</p>
    <p n="46">CHAMOIS-HUNTER ( appearing on the top of a rock ) . AIR — Second Variation of the Ranz des Vaches .</p>
    <p n="47">O'er the heights growls the thunder , while quivers the bridge , Yet no fear feels the hunter , though dizzy the ridge ; He strides on undaunted , O'er plains icy-bound , Where spring never blossoms , Nor verdure is found ; And , a broad sea of mist lying under his feet , Man 's dwellings his vision no longer can greet ; The world he but views When the clouds broken are — With its pastures so green , Through the vapor afar .</p>
    <p n="48">From William Tell , act iii . scene 1 .</p>
    <p n="49">WALTER sings .</p>
    <p n="50">Bow and arrow bearing , Over hills and streams Moves the hunter daring , Soon as daylight gleams .</p>
    <p n="51">As all flying creatures Own the eagle 's sway , So the hunter , Nature 's Mounts and crags obey .</p>
    <p n="52">Over space he reigneth , And he makes his prize All his bolt attaineth , All that creeps or flies .</p>
    <p n="53">From William Tell , act iv . scene 3 .</p>
    <p n="54">CHORUS OF BROTHERS OF MERCY .</p>
    <p n="55">Death comes to man with hasty stride , No respite is to him e'er given ; He 's stricken down in manhood 's pride , E'en in mid race from earth he 's driven . Prepared , or not , to go from here , Before his Judge he must appear !</p>
    <p n="56">From Turandot , act ii . scene 4 .</p>
    <p n="57">RIDDLE .</p>
    <p n="58">The tree whereon decay All those from mortals sprung ,— Full old , and yet whose spray Is ever green and young ; To catch the light , it rolls Each leaf upon one side ; The other , black as coals , The sun has ne'er descried .</p>
    <p n="59">It places on new rings As often as it blows ; The age , too , of all things To mortal gaze it shows . Upon its bark so green A name oft meets the eye , Yet ‘ tis no longer seen , When it grows old and dry . This tree — what can it mean ? I wait for thy reply .<span type="note_anchor">[ 70 ]</span></p>
    <p n="60">From Mary Stuart , act iii , scene 1 .</p>
    <p n="61">SCENE — A Park . MARY advances hastily from behind some trees . HANNAH KENNEDY follows her slowly .</p>
    <p n="62">MARY .</p>
    <p n="63">Let me my newly-won liberty taste ! Let me rejoice as a child once again ! And , as on pinions , with airy foot hast Over the tapestried green of the plain ! Have I escaped from my prison so drear ? Shall I no more in my sad dungeon pine ? Let me in long and in thirsty draughts here Drink in the breezes , so free , so divine</p>
    <p n="64">Thanks , thanks , ye trees , in smiling verdure dressed , In that ye veil my prison-walls from sight ! I 'll dream that I am free and blest Why should I waken from a dream so bright ? Do not the spacious heavens encompass me ? Behold ! my gaze , unshackled , free , Pierces with joy the trackless realms of light ! There , where the gray-tinged hills of mist project , My kingdom 's boundaries begin ; Yon clouds , that tow'rd the south their course direct , France 's far-distant ocean seek to win .</p>
    <p n="65">Swiftly-flying clouds , hardy sailors through air ! Mortal hath roamed with ye , sailed with ye , ne'er ! Greetings of love to my youthful home bear ! I am a prisoner , I am in chains , Ah , not a herald , save ye , now remains , Free through the air hath your path ever been , Ye are not subject to England 's proud queen !</p>
    <p n="66">Yonder 's a fisherman trimming his boat . E'en that frail skiff from all danger might tear me , And to the dwellings of friends it might bear me . Scarcely his earnings can keep life afloat . Richly with treasures his lap I 'd heap over ,— Oh ! what a draught should reward him to-day ! Fortune held fast in his nets he 'd discover , If in his bark he would take me away !</p>
    <p n="67">Hear'st thou the horn of the hunter resound , Wakening the echo through forest and plain ? Ah , on my spirited courser to bound ! Once more to join in the mirth-stirring train ! Hark ! how the dearly-loved tones come again ! Blissful , yet sad , the remembrance they wake ; Oft have they fallen with joy on mine ear , When in the highlands the bugle rang clear , Rousing the chase over mountain and brake .</p>
    <p n="68">From The Maid of Orleans , Prologue , scene 4 .</p>
    <p n="69">JOAN OF ARC ( soliloquizing ) .</p>
    <p n="70">Farewell , ye mountains , and ye pastures dear , Ye still and happy valleys , fare ye well ! No longer may Joan 's footsteps linger here , Joan bids ye now a long , a last farewell !</p>
    <p n="71">Ye meadows that I watered , and each bush Set by my hands , ne'er may your verdure fail ! Farewell , ye grots , ye springs that cooling gush Thou echo , blissful voice of this sweet vale , So wont to give me back an answering strain ,— Joan must depart , and ne'er return again !</p>
    <p n="72">Ye haunts of all my silent joys of old , I leave ye now behind forevermore ! Disperse , ye lambs , far o'er the trackless wold ! She now hath gone who tended you of yore ! I must away to guard another fold , On yonder field of danger , stained with gore . Thus am I bidden by a spirit 's tone ‘ Tis no vain earthly longing drives me on .</p>
    <p n="73">For He who erst to Moses on the height Of Horeb , in the fiery bush came down , And bade him stand in haughty Pharaoh 's sight , He who made choice of Jesse 's pious son , The shepherd , as his champion in the fight ,— He who to shepherds grace hath ever shown , He thus addressed me from this lofty tree : “ Go hence ! On earth my witness thou shalt be !</p>
    <p n="74">“ In rugged brass , then , clothe thy members now , In steel thy gentle bosom must be dressed ! No mortal love thy heart must e'er allow , With earthly passion 's sinful flame possessed . Ne'er will the bridal wreath adorn thy brow , No darling infant blossom on thy breast ; Yet thou with warlike honors shalt be laden , Raising thee high above each earthly maiden .</p>
    <p n="75">“ For when the bravest in the fight despair , When France appears to wait her final blow , Then thou my holy oriflamme must bear ; And , as the ripened corn the reapers mow , Hew down the conqueror as he triumphs there ; His fortune 's wheel thou thus wilt overthrow , To France 's hero-sons salvation bring , Deliver Rheims once more , and crown thy king ! ”</p>
    <p n="76">The Lord hath promised to send down a sign A helmet he hath sent , it comes from Him ,— His sword endows mine arm with strength divine , I feel the courage of the cherubim ; To join the battle-turmoil how I pine ! A raging tempest thrills through every limb ; The summons to the field bursts on mine ear , My charger paws the ground , the trump rings clear .</p>
    <p n="77">From The Maid of Orleans , act iv . scene 1 .</p>
    <p n="78">SCENE — A hall prepared for a festival . The pillars are covered with festoons of flowers ; flutes and hautboys are heard behind the scene .</p>
    <p n="79">JOAN OF ARC ( soliloquizing ) .</p>
    <p n="80">Each weapon rests , war 's tumults cease to sound , While dance and song succeed the bloody fray ; Through every street the merry footsteps bound , Altar and church are clad in bright array , And gates of branches green arise around , Over the columns twine the garlands gay ; Rheims cannot hold the ever-swelling train That seeks the nation-festival to gain .</p>
    <p n="81">All with one joyous feeling are elate , One single thought is thrilling every breast ; What , until now , was severed by fierce hate , Is by the general rapture truly blessed . By each who called this land his parent-state , The name of Frenchman proudly is confessed ; The glory is revived of olden days , And to her regal son France homage pays .</p>
    <p n="82">Yet I who have achieved this work of pride , I cannot share the rapture felt by all : My heart is changed , my heart is turned aside , It shuns the splendor of this festival ; ‘ Tis in the British camp it seeks to hide ,— ‘ Tis on the foe my yearning glances fall ; And from the joyous circle I must steal , My bosom 's crime o'erpowering to conceal .</p>
    <p n="83">Who ? I ? What ! in my bosom chaste Can mortal 's image have a seat ? This heart , by heavenly glory graced ,— Dares it with earthly love to beat ? The saviour of my country , I ,— The champion of the Lord Most High , Own for my country 's foe a flame — To the chaste sun my guilt proclaim , And not be crushed beneath my shame ?</p>
    <p n="84">( The music behind the scene changes into a soft , melting melody . )</p>
    <p n="85">Woe ! oh woe ! what strains enthralling ! How bewildering to mine ear Each his voice beloved recalling , Charming up his image dear !</p>
    <p n="86">Would that battle-tempests bound me ! Would that spears were whizzing round me In the hotly-raging strife ! Could my courage find fresh life !</p>
    <p n="87">How those tones , those voices blest Coil around my bosom burning All the strength within my breast Melting into tender yearning , Into tears of sadness turning !</p>
    <p n="88">( The flutes are again heard — she falls into a silent melancholy . )</p>
    <p n="89">Gentle crook ! oh that I never For the sword had bartered thee ! Sacred oak ! why didst thou ever From thy branches speak to me ? Would that thou to me in splendor , Queen of heaven , hadst ne'er come down ! Take — all claim I must surrender ,— Take , oh take away thy crown !</p>
    <p n="90">Ah , I open saw yon heaven , Saw the features of the blest ! Yet to earth my hopes are riven , In the skies they ne'er can rest ! Wherefore make me ply with ardor This vocation , terror-fraught ? Would this heart were rendered harder . That by heaven to feel was taught !</p>
    <p n="91">To proclaim Thy might sublime Those select , who , free from crime , In Thy lasting mansions stand ; Send Thou forth Thy spirit-band , The immortal , and the pure , Feelingless , from tears secure Never choose a maiden fair , Shepherdess ’ weak spirit ne'er !</p>
    <p n="92">Kings ’ dissensions wherefore dread I , Why the fortune of the fight ? Guilelessly my lambs once fed I On the silent mountain-height . Yet Thou into life didst bear me , To the halls where monarchs throne . In the toils of guilt to snare me — Ah , the choice was not mine own !</p>
