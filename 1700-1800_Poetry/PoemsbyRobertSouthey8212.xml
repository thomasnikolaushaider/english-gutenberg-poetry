    <docTitle><titlePart>POEMS by Robert Southey</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docDate><date>1797</date>GODDESS of the LYRE ! with thee comes Majestic TRUTH ; and where TRUTH deigns to come , Her sister LIBERTY will not be far . Akenside . SONNET . With wayworn feet a Pilgrim woe-begone Life 's upward road I journeyed many a day , And hymning many a sad yet soothing lay Beguil 'd my wandering with the charms of song . Lonely my heart and rugged was my way , Yet often pluck 'd I as I past along The wild and simple flowers of Poesy , And as beseem 'd the wayward Fancy 's child Entwin 'd each random weed that pleas 'd mine eye . Accept the wreath , BELOVED ! it is wild And rudely garlanded ; yet scorn not thou The humble offering , where the sad rue weaves ‘ Mid gayer flowers its intermingled leaves , And I have twin 'd the myrtle for thy brow . I have collected in this Volume the productions of very distant periods . The lyric pieces were written in earlier youth ; I now think the Ode the most worthless species of composition as well as the most difficult , and should never again attempt it , even if my future pursuits were such as allowed leisure for poetry . The poems addressed to the heart and the understanding are those of my maturer judgment . The Inscriptions will be found to differ from the Greek simplicity of Akenside 's in the point that generally concludes them . The Sonnets were written first , or I would have adopted a different title , and avoided the shackle of rhyme and the confinement to fourteen lines .</docDate>

       <l n="3">Mary ! of these the Poet sung , for these</l>

       <l n="5">View this degrading conquest . At that age</l>
       <l n="6">No MAID OF ARC had snatch 'd from coward man</l>
       <l n="7">The heaven-blest sword of Liberty ; thy sex</l>
       <l n="8">Could boast no female ROLAND 'S martyrdom ;</l>
       <l n="9">No CORDE 'S angel and avenging arm</l>
       <l n="10">Had sanctified again the Murderer 's name</l>
       <l n="11">As erst when Caesar perish 'd : yet some strains</l>

       <l n="4">Glad as the weary traveller tempest-tost</l>
       <l n="5">To reach secure at length his native coast ,</l>
       <l n="6">Who wandering long o'er distant lands has sped ,</l>
       <l n="7">The night-blast wildly howling round his head ,</l>
       <l n="8">Known all the woes of want , and felt the storm</l>
       <l n="9">Of the bleak winter parch his shivering form ;</l>
       <l n="10">The journey o'er and every peril past</l>
       <l n="11">Beholds his little cottage-home at last ,</l>
       <l n="12">And as he sees afar the smoke curl slow ,</l>
       <l n="13">Feels his full eyes with transport overflow :</l>
       <l n="14">So from the scene where Death and Anguish reign ,</l>
       <l n="15">And Vice and Folly drench with blood the plain ,</l>
       <l n="16">Joyful I turn , to sing how Woman 's praise</l>
       <l n="17">Avail 'd again Jerusalem to raise ,</l>
       <l n="18">Call 'd forth the sanction of the Despot 's nod ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="20">Darius gives the feast : to Persia 's court ,</l>
       <l n="21">Awed by his will , the obedient throng resort ,</l>
       <l n="22">Attending Satraps swell the Prince 's pride ,</l>
       <l n="23">And vanquish 'd Monarchs grace their Conqueror 's side .</l>
       <l n="24">No more the Warrior wears the garb of war ,</l>
       <l n="25">Sharps the strong steel , or mounts the scythed car ;</l>
       <l n="26">No more Judaea 's sons dejected go ,</l>
       <l n="27">And hang the head and heave the sigh of woe .</l>
       <l n="28">From Persia 's rugged hills descend the train .</l>
       <l n="29">From where Orontes foams along the plain ,</l>
       <l n="30">From where Choaspes rolls his royal waves ,</l>
       <l n="31">And India sends her sons , submissive slaves .</l>
       <l n="32">Thy daughters Babylon to grace the feast</l>
       <l n="33">Weave the loose robe , and paint the flowery vest ,</l>
       <l n="34">With roseate wreaths they braid the glossy hair .</l>
       <l n="35">They tinge the cheek which Nature form 'd so fair ,</l>
       <l n="36">Learn the soft step , the soul-subduing glance ,</l>
       <l n="37">Melt in the song , and swim adown the dance .</l>
       <l n="38">Exalted on the Monarch 's golden throne</l>
       <l n="39">In royal state the fair Apame shone ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="40">Her form of majesty , her eyes of fire</l>
       <l n="41">Chill with respect , or kindle with desire .</l>
       <l n="42">The admiring multitude her charms adore ,</l>
       <l n="43">And own her worthy of the crown she wore .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="44">Now on his couch reclin 'd Darius lay ,</l>
       <l n="45">Tir 'd with the toilsome pleasures of the day ;</l>
       <l n="46">Without Judaea 's watchful sons await</l>
       <l n="47">To guard the sleeping pageant of the state .</l>
       <l n="48">Three youths were these of Judah 's royal race ,</l>
       <l n="49">Three youths whom Nature dower 'd with every grace ,</l>
       <l n="50">To each the form of symmetry she gave ,</l>
       <l n="51">And haughty Genius curs 'd each favorite slave ;</l>
       <l n="52">These fill 'd the cup , around the Monarch kept ,</l>
       <l n="53">Serv 'd as he spake , and guarded whilst he slept .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="54">Yet oft for Salem 's hallowed towers laid low</l>
       <l n="55">The sigh would heave , the unbidden tear would flow ;</l>
       <l n="56">And when the dull and wearying round of Power</l>
       <l n="57">Allowed Zorobabel one vacant hour ,</l>
       <l n="58">He lov 'd on Babylon 's high wall to roam ,</l>
       <l n="59">And stretch the gaze towards his distant home ,</l>
       <l n="60">Or on Euphrates ’ willowy banks reclin 'd</l>
       <l n="61">Hear the sad harp moan fitful to the wind .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="62">As now the perfum 'd lamps stream wide their light ,</l>
       <l n="63">And social converse chears the livelong night ,</l>
       <l n="64">Thus spake Zorobabel , “ too long in vain</l>
       <l n="65">“ For Sion desolate her sons complain ;</l>
       <l n="66">“ In anguish worn the joyless years lag slow ,</l>
       <l n="67">“ And these proud conquerors mock their captive 's woe .</l>
       <l n="68">“ Whilst Cyrus triumph 'd here in victor state</l>
       <l n="69">“ A brighter prospect chear 'd our exil 'd fate ,</l>
       <l n="70">“ Our sacred walls again he bade us raise ,</l>
       <l n="71">“ And to Jehovah rear the pile of praise .</l>
       <l n="72">“ Quickly these fond hopes faded from our eyes ,</l>
       <l n="73">“ As the frail sun that gilds the wintry skies ,</l>
       <l n="74">“ And spreads a moment 's radiance o'er the plain ,</l>
       <l n="75">“ Soon hid by clouds that dim the scene again .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="76">“ Opprest by Artaxerxes ’ jealous reign</l>
       <l n="77">“ We vainly pleaded here , and wept in vain .</l>
       <l n="78">“ Now when Darius , chief of mild command ,</l>
       <l n="79">“ Bids joy and pleasure fill the festive land ,</l>
       <l n="80">“ Still shall we droop the head in sullen grief ,</l>
       <l n="81">“ And sternly silent shun to seek relief ?</l>
       <l n="82">“ What if amid the Monarch 's mirthful throng</l>
       <l n="83">“ Our harps should echo to the chearful song ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="84">“ Fair is the occasion , ” thus the one replied ,</l>
       <l n="85">“ And now let all our tuneful skill be tried .</l>
       <l n="86">“ Whilst the gay courtiers quaff the smiling bowl ,</l>
       <l n="87">“ And wine 's strong fumes inspire the madden 'd soul ,</l>
       <l n="88">“ Where all around is merriment , be mine</l>
       <l n="89">“ To strike the lute , and praise the power of Wine .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="90">“ And whilst ” his friend replied in state alone</l>
       <l n="91">“ Lord of the earth Darius fills the throne ,</l>
       <l n="92">“ Be yours the mighty power of Wine to sing ,</l>
       <l n="93">“ My lute shall sound the praise of Persia 's King . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="94">To them Zorobabel , on themes like these</l>
       <l n="95">“ Seek ye the Monarch of Mankind to please ;</l>
       <l n="96">“ To Wine superior or to Power 's strong arms ,</l>
       <l n="97">“ Be mine to sing resistless Woman 's charms .</l>
       <l n="98">“ To him victorious in the rival lays</l>
       <l n="99">“ Shall just Darius give the meed of praise ;</l>
       <l n="100">“ The purple robe his honor 'd frame shall fold ,</l>

       <l n="104">“ His the soft turban , his the car 's array</l>
       <l n="105">“ O'er Babylon 's high wall to wheel its way ;</l>
       <l n="106">“ And for his wisdom seated on the throne ,</l>
       <l n="107">“ For the KING 'S COUSIN shall the Bard be known . ”</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="108">Intent they meditate the future lay ,</l>
       <l n="109">And watch impatient for the dawn of day .</l>
       <l n="110">The morn rose clear , and shrill were heard the flute ,</l>
       <l n="111">The cornet , sackbut , dulcimer , and lute ;</l>
       <l n="112">To Babylon 's gay streets the throng resort ,</l>
       <l n="113">Swarm thro ’ the gates , and fill the festive court .</l>
       <l n="114">High on his throne Darius tower 'd in pride ,</l>
       <l n="115">The fair Apame grac 'd the Sovereign 's side ;</l>
       <l n="116">And now she smil 'd , and now with mimic frown</l>

      <docTitle><titlePart>POEMS on the SLAVE TRADE . I am Innocent of this Blood , SEE YE TO IT !</titlePart></docTitle>
     </titlePage>
     <div type="preface">
      <head>PREFACE .</head>
      <p>When first the Abolition of the SLAVE-TRADE was agitated in England , the friends of humanity endeavoured by two means to accomplish it .— To destroy the Trade immediately by the interference of Government or by the disuse of West-Indian productions : a slow but certain method . For a while Government held the language of justice , and individuals with enthusiasm banished sugar from their tables . This enthusiasm soon cooled ; the majority of those who had made this sacrifice ( I prostitute the word , but they thought it a sacrifice ) persuaded themselves that Parliament would do all , and that individual efforts were no longer necessary . Thus ended the one attempt ; and the duplicity with which Mr. Wilberforce has been amused , and the Slave-Merchants satisfied , has now effectually destroyed the other .</p>
      <p n="1">There are yet two other methods remaining , by which this traffic will probably be abolished . By the introduction of East-Indian or Maple Sugar , or by the just and general rebellion of the Negroes : by the vindictive justice of the Africans , or by the civilized Christians finding it their interest to be humane .</p>
      <p n="2">To these past and present prospects the following Poems occasionally allude : to the English custom of exciting wars upon the Slave Coast that they may purchase prisoners , and to the punishment sometimes inflicted upon a Negro for murder , of which Hector St. John was an eye-witness .</p>

       <l n="66">Curs 'd that ill hour when I became a soldier !</l>

     <note xml:id="note1_6" place="bottom" n="1">I extract the following picture of consummate horror , from the notes to a Poem written in twelve syllable verse upon the campaign of 1794 and 1795 ; it was during the retreat to Deventer . “ We could not proceed a hundred yards without perceiving the dead bodies of men , women , children and horses in every direction . One scene made an impression upon my memory which time will never be able to efface . Near another cart we perceived a stout looking man , and a beautiful young woman with an infant , about seven months old , at the breast , all three frozen and dead . The mother had most certainly expired in the act of suckling her child , as with one breast exposed , she lay upon the drifted snow , the milk to all appearance in a stream drawn from the nipple by the babe , and instantly congealed . The infant seemed as if its lips had but just then been disengaged , and it reposed its little head upon the mother 's bosom , with , an overflow of milk , frozen as it trickled from the mouth ; their countenances were perfectly composed and fresh , resembling those of persons in a sound and tranquil slumber . ”</note>

       <l n="24">The abundant earth , and blindly bow them down</l>
       <l n="25">Before the Moloch shrines of WEALTH and POWER ,</l>
       <l n="26">AUTHORS of EVIL . Oh it is most sweet</l>
       <l n="27">To medicine with thy wiles the wearied heart ,</l>
       <l n="28">Sick of reality . The little pile</l>
       <l n="29">That tops the summit of that craggy hill</l>
       <l n="30">Shall be my dwelling ; craggy is the hill</l>
       <l n="31">And steep , yet thro ’ yon hazels upward leads</l>
       <l n="32">The easy path , along whose winding way</l>

       <l n="35">Gleam thro ’ the thicket ; and ascending on</l>
       <l n="36">Now pause me to survey the goodly vale</l>
       <l n="37">That opens on my vision . Half way up</l>
       <l n="38">Pleasant it were upon some broad smooth rock</l>
       <l n="39">To sit and sun me , and look down below</l>
       <l n="40">And watch the goatherd down that high-bank 'd path</l>
       <l n="41">Urging his flock grotesque ; and bidding now</l>
       <l n="42">His lean rough dog from some near cliff to drive</l>
       <l n="43">The straggler ; while his barkings loud and quick</l>
       <l n="44">Amid their trembling bleat arising oft ,</l>
       <l n="45">Fainter and fainter from the hollow road</l>
       <l n="46">Send their far echoes , till the waterfall ,</l>
       <l n="47">Hoarse bursting from the cavern 'd cliff beneath ,</l>
       <l n="48">Their dying murmurs drown . A little yet</l>
       <l n="49">Onward , and I have gain 'd the upmost height .</l>
       <l n="50">Fair spreads the vale below : I see the stream</l>
       <l n="51">Stream radiant on beneath the noontide sky .</l>
       <l n="52">Where the town-spires behind the castle towers</l>
       <l n="53">Rise graceful ; brown the mountain in its shade ,</l>
       <l n="54">Whose circling grandeur , part by mists conceal 'd ,</l>
       <l n="55">Part with white rocks resplendant in the sun ,</l>
       <l n="56">Should bound mine eyes ; aye and my wishes too ,</l>
       <l n="57">For I would have no hope or fear beyond .</l>
       <l n="58">The empty turmoil of the worthless world ,</l>
       <l n="59">Its vanities and vices would not vex</l>
       <l n="60">My quiet heart . The traveller , who beheld</l>
       <l n="61">The low tower of the little pile , might deem</l>
       <l n="62">It were the house of GOD : nor would he err</l>
       <l n="63">So deeming , for that home would be the home</l>
       <l n="64">Of PEACE and LOVE , and they would hallow it</l>
       <l n="65">To HIM . Oh life of blessedness ! to reap</l>

       <l n="69">Ye leave her to reality awak 'd ,</l>
       <l n="70">Like the poor captive , from some fleeting dream</l>
       <l n="71">Of friends and liberty and home restor 'd ,</l>

     <p>In Finland there is a Castle which is called the New Rock , moated about with a river of unfounded depth , the water black and the fish therein very distateful to the palate . In this are spectres often seen , which foreshew either the death of the Governor , or some prime officer belonging to the place ; and most commonly it appeareth in the shape of an harper , sweetly singing and dallying and playing under the water .</p>
     <p>It is reported of one Donica , that after she was dead , the Devil walked in her body for the space of two years , so that none suspected but that she was still alive ; for she did both speak and eat , though very sparingly ; only she had a deep paleness on her countenance , which was the only sign of death . At length a Magician coming by where she was then in the company of many other virgins , as soon as he beheld her he said , “ fair Maids , why keep you company with the dead Virgin whom you suppose to be alive ? ” when taking away the magic charm which was tied under her arm , the body fell down lifeless and without motion .</p>
     <p>The following Ballad is founded on these stories . They are to be found in the notes to The Hierarchies of the blessed Angels ; a Poem by Thomas Heywood , printed in folio by Adam Islip , 1635 .</p>

     <p>Divers Princes and Noblemen being assembled in a beautiful and fair Palace , which was situate upon the river Rhine , they beheld a boat or small barge make toward the shore , drawn by a Swan in a silver chain , the one end fastened about her neck , the other to the vessel ; and in it an unknown soldier , a man of a comely personage and graceful presence , who stept upon the shore ; which done , the boat guided by the Swan left him , and floated down the river . This man fell afterward in league with a fair gentlewoman , married her , and by her had many children . After some years , the same Swan came with the same barge into the same place ; the soldier entering into it , was carried thence the way he came , left wife , children and family , and was never seen amongst them after .</p>
     <p>Now who can judge this to be other than one of those spirits that are named Incubi ? says Thomas Heywood . I have adopted his story , but not his solution , making the unknown soldier not an evil spirit , but one who had purchased happiness of a malevolent being , by the promised sacrifice of his first-born child .</p>
