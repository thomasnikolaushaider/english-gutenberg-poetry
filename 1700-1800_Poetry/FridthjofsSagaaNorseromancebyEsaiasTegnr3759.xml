   <head>NOTE BY THE TRANSLATORS</head>
   <p>Tegne'r ' s poem , “ Fridthjof 's Saga , ” has been printed in Sweden in many large editions and in almost every possible style . It has been illustrated , and it has been set to music . It has been translated into nearly all the modern European languages . Moreover it has been rendered into English by eighteen different translators , and has been twice reprinted in America . Bayard Taylor edited an American edition of a translation by Rev . William L. Blackley of Dublin , and published it about ten years ago . Professor R. B. Anderson has just published in his “ Viking Tales , ” a translation made by Professor George Stephens of Copenhagen , and which received the sanction of Bishop Tegne'r himself .</p>
   <p>And yet we venture to add another , and present here the firstcomplete American translation . Mr. Taylor said in his preface to Blackley 's version that there had never been an English Fridthjof 's Saga which was satisfactory to Swedes . This is probably owing to the fact that the Swedes have become so familiar with its original measures and so accustomed to its peculiar rhythm , that they cannot willingly dispense with any part of the form which Tegne'r gave it . Several of the metres employed by him were unknown to Swedish readers until they appeared in this poem . Tegne'r ' s experiment of introducing them was a successful one ; and they are now , in the minds of Swedes , as much a part of the work as the story itself . The feminine rhymes , occurring in fifteen of the twenty-four cantos , are so melodious that no one who had heard the original , even if he did not understand a word of it , could be quite satisfied with a version which does not reproduce them . The feminine rhymes and the alliteration of Canto XXI have presented obstacles which no single translation has hitherto overcome .</p>
   <p>The original measures the feminine rhymes and the alliteration of “ Ring 's Drapa , ” are , in our estimation , essential features of a good rendering of the poem , and if we have done our work well we do not fear that any one will think there are too many translations .</p>
   <p>For a fuller history of “ Fridthjof ‘ s Saga ” than can be given in this note , we refer the reader to Anderson 's “ Viking Tales , ” where the sagas on which this story is founded appear in full .</p>
   <p>The preparation of this translation has been a home work which has brightened for us the firelight of many a pleasant evening . We publish it in full faith that it will have a like happy effect in whatever home it may be read .</p>

     <l n="1">No , Helge is my father ,</l>
     <l n="2">Is in my father 's stead ; on his consent</l>
     <l n="3">My hand depends , and Ing'borg will not steal</l>
     <l n="4">Her happiness , however near it stands .</l>
     <l n="5">Ah ! what would woman be if she cut loose</l>
     <l n="6">The sacred band with which the Allfather binds</l>
     <l n="7">Unto the stronger power her gentle being ?</l>
     <l n="8">The water-lily pale resembles her ;</l>
     <l n="9">It rises with the wave and with it falls .</l>
     <l n="10">The sailor 's keel goes forward over it</l>
     <l n="11">And marks it not although it cut the stem .</l>
     <l n="12">Such is indeed her fate ! And yet the flower ,</l>
     <l n="13">As long as clings the root unto the sand ,</l>
     <l n="14">Its growth increases , borrowing color pure</l>
     <l n="15">From its pale sister stars which shine above ,—</l>
     <l n="16">Itself a star upon the waters blue .</l>
     <l n="17">But rudely broken loose , it ceaseless drives ,</l>
     <l n="18">A withered leaf along deserted waves .</l>
     <l n="19">Last night ,— that was indeed a fearful night ,</l>
     <l n="20">An unrewarded watch I kept for thee ,</l>
     <l n="21">And children of the night , the serious thoughts ,</l>
     <l n="22">With raven locks went thronging closely by</l>
     <l n="23">My ever watchful , burning , tearful eyes ;</l>
     <l n="24">And Balder too , the bloodless god looked down</l>
     <l n="25">On me with frowning glances full of threats .</l>
     <l n="26">Last night I pondered o'er my wretched fate .</l>
     <l n="27">My resolution 's taken ; I remain</l>
     <l n="28">Obedient victim at my brother 's altar .</l>
     <l n="29">Yet it is well I did not hear thee then ,</l>
     <l n="30">With fabled islands floating in the clouds</l>
     <l n="31">Where evening 's glowing twilights always show</l>
     <l n="32">A flowery world of peace and happy love .</l>
     <l n="33">Who knows how weak one is ? My childhood dreams</l>
     <l n="34">Though silent long , with joy rise up again ,</l>
     <l n="35">And whisper in my anxious ear with voice</l>
     <l n="36">Familiar as a sister 's kindly tones ,</l>
     <l n="37">As tender as a lover 's ardent praise .</l>
     <l n="38">I hear ye not ! ah , no , I hear ye not ,</l>
     <l n="39">Alluring accents once so fondly loved !</l>
     <l n="40">A child of Northland cannot elsewhere dwell ;</l>
     <l n="41">Too pale am I for those bright summer roses ; -</l>
     <l n="42">Too colorless my mind for that deep glow ;</l>
     <l n="43">The scorching sun would quite consume me there .</l>
     <l n="44">Of anxious longing full , my eyes would seek</l>
     <l n="45">The northern star which always watchful stands</l>
     <l n="46">A heavenly sentry o'er our fathers ’ graves .</l>
     <l n="47">My noble Fridthjof shall not now desert</l>
     <l n="48">The cherished hind that he was born to guard ;</l>
     <l n="49">He shall not fling away his honored name</l>
     <l n="50">To gain so poor a thing , a maiden 's love .</l>
     <l n="51">A life where spins the sun from year to year ,</l>
     <l n="52">And where each day is ever like the next —</l>
     <l n="53">A beauteous but unending sameness , is</l>
     <l n="54">For woman only , but for manly souls ,</l>
     <l n="55">And most for thine , it 's quiet , weary dullness .</l>
     <l n="56">Thou thrivest best where storms are raging round .</l>
     <l n="57">On foaming pacers o'er the heaving sea ,</l>
     <l n="58">And on thy tossing plank , come life or death ,</l>
     <l n="59">Thou mayest fight with peril for thine honor .</l>
     <l n="60">The beauteous desert thou dost paint , would be</l>
     <l n="61">A grave for high achievements , not yet born ;</l>
     <l n="62">And like thy shield , with rust would be dissolved ,</l>
     <l n="63">Thine independent mind . It shall not be !</l>
     <l n="64">I will not steal away my Fridthjof 's name</l>

      <l n="255">The VIKING CODE .</l>
     </lg>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Now he floated around on the desolate sea , like a prey-seeking falcon he rode , To the champions on board he gave justice and law ; wilt thou hear now the sea-viking 's code ?</p>
   <p>“ Make no tent on thy ship , never sleep in a house , for a foe within doors you may view ; On his shield sleeps the viking ; his sword in his hand , and his tent is the heavenly blue .</p>
   <p>See how short is the shaft of the hammer of Thor , but an ell 's length the sword blade of Frey ; ‘ Tis enough , for your weapon will ne'er be too short if you dare near the enemy stay .</p>
   <p>“ When the storm rageth fierce , hoist the sail to the top ,— O how merry the storm-king appears ; Let her drive ! let her drive ! better founder than strike , for who strikes is a slave to his fears .</p>
   <p>“ Never take on thy vessel the land-sheltered maid ; were she Freyja herself she 'd ensnare ; For the dimples she wears are but pitfalls for men , and a net is her free flowing hair .</p>
   <p>“ Wine is Allfather 's drink , and the cup is allowed if you only can use it with sense ; He who falls on the land may arise ,— who falls here he to Ran , the sleep-giving , goes hence .</p>
   <p>“ If a merchant sail by , you must shelter his ship , but the weak will not tribute withhold ; You are king of the waves , he a slave to his gains ; and your steel is as good as his gold .</p>
   <p>“ Let your goods he divided by lot or by dice , how it falls you may never complain ; But the sea-king himself takes no part in the lots ,— he considers the honor his gain .</p>
   <p>“ If a viking-ship come , there is grappling and strife , and the fight ‘ neath the shields will rejoice ; If you yield but a pace you are parted from us ; ‘ tis the law , you may act by your choice .</p>
   <p>“ If you win , be content ; he who praying for peace yields his sword , is no longer a foe ; “ Prayer 's a Valhalla-child , hear the suppliant voice ; he 's a coward who answereth no .</p>
   <p>“ Wounds are viking 's reward , and the pride of the man on whose breast or whose forehead they stand ; Let them bleed on unbound till the close of the day , if you wish to be one of our band . ”</p>
   <p>Thus his law was enrolled ,— and his name , every day , through all foreign coasts grew renowned ; For his like was not seen on the blue-rolling sea , nor the valor his champions crowned .</p>
   <p>Then he sat by the rudder and sullenly gazed in the depths of the blue rocking tide ; “ Thou art deep ; in thy depths thriveth peace , it may be , but it thriveth not here where we ride .</p>
   <p>“ Is the White God enraged ? Let him take up his sword , I will fall if it thus is designed ; But he sits in the skies , and the thoughts he sends down which forever are clouding my mind . ”</p>
   <p>When the conflict came on , then his spirit arose like an eagle refreshed for its flight ; And his brow it was clear , and his voice it rang high ,— like the thunderer first in the fight .</p>
   <p>So from conquest to conquest unbroken he went , and was safe o'er the high , foaming grave ;</p>
   <p>And he saw in the south many islands and rocks , till he came to the calm Grecian wave .</p>
   <p>When he saw the green groves that stand out from the waves , and the temple before him uprose , What he thought Freyja knows , and the poet knows too , and the lover , he knows , ah ! he knows !</p>
   <p>“ Here we ought to have dwelt , here 's the island and grove , here the fane as my father set forth . It was here , it was here I invited my love , but the cruel one staid in the North .</p>
   <p>“ Surely peace has its home in those blissful green dales ,— in the colonnades , memory 's words ; Like the whisper of love are the murmuring founts , and a bride-song the voice of the birds .</p>
   <p>“ Where is Ingeborg now ? Hath forgotten me quite for the gray-haired and withered old king ? I can never forget , but my life I would give , if one sight of my love it would bring .</p>
   <p>“ Now three years have passed by since the land I beheld where heroic achievement prevails ; Tower the honored mounts yet to the heavenly blue ? is it green in my forefathers ’ dales ?</p>
   <p>“ On the grave where my father is laid I once planted a tree ; can it be it lives now ? And who cares for the weakling ? Thou earth give it moisture , and dew , kindly heaven , give thou .</p>
   <p>“ But why linger I longer on far distant waves , taking tribute and striking men down ? For my soul but despises the glittering gold , and I 've gained quite enough of renown .</p>
   <p>“ There 's a flag on the mast and it points to the North , in the North is the land I hold dear ; I will follow the course of the heavenly winds , and back to the Northland I 'll steer . ”</p>

    <head>FRIDTHJOF COMES TO KING RING .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">King Ring in state was seated at Yule-time drinking mead .</l>
     <l n="2">And with him sat his consort , so white and rosy red ;</l>
     <l n="3">They seemed like Spring and Autumn . when both together seen ,—</l>
     <l n="4">The king was chilly Autumn , fresh Spring the fair young queen .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">A man , unknown , there entered within the spacious hall ,</l>
     <l n="6">From head to foot enveloped , a bear-skin covering all ;</l>
     <l n="7">And though by staff supported , and bent with age and care ,</l>
     <l n="8">He stood a head the taller than any champion there .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">He chose for seat to rest him a bench beside the door ,—</l>
     <l n="10">‘ Tis now the poor man 's station , as ‘ twas in days of yore ;</l>
     <l n="11">The courtiers all laughed loudly , with many a gibe and jest ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">The stranger 's eyes flashed lightning which made his anger felt ,</l>
     <l n="14">And quick a young man seizing with one hand , by the belt ,</l>
     <l n="15">Both up and down he turned him ; then ceased the gleeful din ,</l>
     <l n="16">For all the rest were silent ,— so you and I had been .</l>

     <l n="40">From off whose noble forehead , and round whose shoulders brave ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="50">Surprised , the queen 's cheeks quickly with changing color glow ,</l>

     <l n="53">Stand swinging on the billow , her bosom rose and fell .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="54">The horn a shrill blast sounded , then silence reigned throughout ;</l>
     <l n="55">The hour for vows was coming , and Frey 's boar now they brought ;</l>
     <l n="56">His mouth contained an apple , wreaths on his neck were laid ,</l>
     <l n="57">His four knees bent beneath him upon a silver cade .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="58">King Ring , his gray locks flowing , arose and straight-way now</l>
     <l n="59">The boar 's head gently touching , he thus declared his vow :</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="62">Then with a smile defiant uprose the stranger tall ,</l>
     <l n="63">A look of wrath heroic spread o'er his features all ,—</l>
     <l n="64">He smote with sword the table till through the hall it rang ;</l>

     <l n="1">Completed now was Balder 's temple . Not enclosed</l>
     <l n="2">As heretofore with fence of wood ; of hammered steel ,</l>
     <l n="3">With golden knobs upon each bar , was built the fence</l>
     <l n="4">Round Balder 's ground . Like steel-clad champions ranged for war ,</l>
     <l n="5">With halberds and with golden helms , there stood it now</l>
     <l n="6">On guard around the sanctuary of the god .</l>
     <l n="7">Of giant stones alone the massive wall was built ,</l>
     <l n="8">And joined with active skill , a noble giant work</l>
     <l n="9">For all eternity ( as is Upsala 's shrine ,)</l>
     <l n="10">Where Norseland saw its Valhal in an earthly mold .</l>
     <l n="11">It stood there in its grandeur on the mountain cliff ,</l>
     <l n="12">And mirrored in the ocean wave its lofty brow ,</l>
     <l n="13">While round about it , like a zone of beauteous flowers ,</l>
     <l n="14">Far stretched the dale of Balder with its sighing groves .</l>
     <l n="15">Its song of birds , a home where peace might reign supreme .</l>
     <l n="16">High rose the copper-bolted portal , and within</l>
     <l n="17">Two colonnades supported on strong omoplates</l>
     <l n="18">The vaulted canopy , and beautiful it hung</l>
     <l n="19">Above the temple , like a concave shield of gold .</l>
     <l n="20">At farthest end stood Balder 's altar . It was hewn</l>
     <l n="21">From one huge block of northern granite : round it coiled</l>
     <l n="22">A graven serpent , covered o'er with written runes , -</l>
     <l n="23">Profoundest thoughts from Vala and from Ha'vama ' l ;</l>
     <l n="24">But in the wall above was left an open space ,—</l>
     <l n="25">A dark blue ground all filled with golden stars ; and there</l>
     <l n="26">A silver image sat — the pious god — as calm</l>
     <l n="27">And mild as sits the silver moon in heaven 's blue .</l>
     <l n="28">Thus seemed the finished shrine . In couples entered now</l>
     <l n="29">Twelve temple virgins , clad in robes of silver gauze ,</l>
     <l n="30">With roses glowing on their cheeks , and roses in</l>
     <l n="31">Their guileless hearts . Before the image of the god ,</l>
     <l n="32">Around the altar newly consecrate they danced ,</l>
     <l n="33">As light spring winds above the flowing fountains flit ,</l>
     <l n="34">As dance the forest elves amid the waving grass .</l>
     <l n="35">While yet the morning dew . like pearls , lies glittering there .</l>
     <l n="36">And while they danced they joyful sang a sacred song</l>
     <l n="37">Of pious Balder , and how dearly he was loved</l>
     <l n="38">By every being ; how he fell ‘ neath Hoder 's dart ,</l>
     <l n="39">And earth and sea and heaven wept . Yet sounded not</l>
     <l n="40">The song as though ‘ twere uttered by a human voice ,</l>
     <l n="41">But as a tone from Breidablik , from Balder 's home ;</l>
     <l n="42">Or like the thought of lover to a lonely maid</l>
     <l n="43">When pipes the quail his deep notes in the hush of night ,</l>
     <l n="44">And over northern birches falls the moonlight soft .</l>
     <l n="45">Enraptured Fridthjof stood ; he leaned upon his sword ,</l>
     <l n="46">And gazed upon the dance . Sweet childhood 's memories thronged</l>
     <l n="47">His vision by ,— an innocent and pleasant folk ,</l>
     <l n="48">With smiling eyes reflecting heaven 's blue , with heads</l>
     <l n="49">Surrounded hy a halo of bright locks , they waved</l>
     <l n="50">A kindly salutation to their childhood 's friend .</l>
     <l n="51">Then sank the bloody shadow of his viking life ,</l>
     <l n="52">With all its conflicts , all its perilous exploits ,</l>
     <l n="53">Down into night , and in his fancy stood he forth</l>
     <l n="54">A flower-crowned monument above their grave .</l>
     <l n="55">And ever , as the song increased , his spirit soared</l>
     <l n="56">From earthly dales below to Valaskjalf above ;</l>
     <l n="57">Then melted human hate and human vengeance , too ,</l>
     <l n="58">As melts the icy coat of mail from off the cliff ,</l>
     <l n="59">When shines the sun in spring . A sea of quiet peace .</l>
     <l n="60">Of silent ecstasy , possessed his hero-soul ;</l>
     <l n="61">It was as if he felt the heart of nature beat</l>
     <l n="62">Against his own ; as if , deep moved , he fain would fold</l>
     <l n="63">Creation in his brotherly embrace , and be at peace</l>
     <l n="64">With every living creature seen of God .</l>
     <l n="65">Then came into the temple Balder 's priest most high ,</l>
     <l n="66">Not young and beauteous as the god , but tall in form ,</l>
     <l n="67">With heavenly mildness beaming in his noble face ,</l>
     <l n="68">While down about his girdle flowed his silver beard .</l>
     <l n="69">An unused reverence possessed proud Fridthjof 's heart ;</l>
     <l n="70">The eagle wings upon his helmet meekly drooped</l>
     <l n="71">Before the aged man , who thus spoke words of peace :</l>
     <l n="72">“ Son Fridthjof , welcome hither I 've expected thee ;</l>
     <l n="73">The strong man gladly roves around the earth and sea ,</l>
     <l n="74">A berserk-like , who pallid bites the shield 's hard edge ,</l>
     <l n="75">But weary grown , and thoughtful , wanders home at last .</l>
     <l n="76">The powerful Thor went many times to Jotunheim ,—</l>
     <l n="77">But spite his belt divine and gloves of finest steel ,</l>
     <l n="78">Still sits the Utgard-Loke on his lofty throne ;</l>
     <l n="79">For evil is itself a power , and will not yield ,— -</l>
     <l n="80">And piety not joined with power is children 's play :</l>
     <l n="81">‘ Tis like the sunbeams on the breast of AEger thrown ,—</l>
     <l n="82">An image faint , which falls and rises with the wave ,</l>
     <l n="83">Foundationless and insecure , devoid of trust .</l>
     <l n="84">But power not joined with virtue eats itself away ,</l>
     <l n="85">As rust the buried sword . ‘ Tis life 's unchecked carouse ;</l>
     <l n="86">The heron of oblivion hovers o'er the cup ,</l>
     <l n="87">And when the drinker wakes , he blushes for his deed .</l>
     <l n="88">All power is from the earth of Ymer 's body formed ;</l>
     <l n="89">Wild waves and flowing waters are the veins therein ,</l>
     <l n="90">From various metals are its tough strong sinews forged ,</l>
     <l n="91">And yet ‘ tis empty , desolate , unfruitful , till</l>
     <l n="92">The sun its light and warmth , heaven 's piety , sends down .</l>
     <l n="93">Then spring the grass and flowers a web of many hues ;</l>
     <l n="94">The tree lifts up its crown and knits its golden fruit ,—</l>
     <l n="95">And man and beast are nourished at the mother 's breast .</l>
     <l n="96">‘ Tis thus with every child of Ask . Opposing weights</l>
     <l n="97">Has Odin laid within the scales of human life ,—</l>
     <l n="98">And when they balance true , then even stands the beam ;</l>
     <l n="99">And heavenly piety and earthly power they 're called .</l>
     <l n="100">The power of Thor is great whene'er about his loins ,</l>
     <l n="101">Immovable , he girds the belt of strength and strikes .</l>
     <l n="102">Indeed is Odin wise , when Urd 's clear silver fount</l>
     <l n="103">He looketh down , and birds swift flying come to bring</l>
     <l n="104">The Asas ’ father tidings from the world 's extreme :</l>
     <l n="105">Yet both turned pale , the radiance of their starry crowns</l>
     <l n="106">Was half extinguished when the pious Balder fell ,—</l>
     <l n="107">The band was he of all the diadems of heaven .</l>
     <l n="108">Then withered on the tree of time its splendid crown ,</l>
     <l n="109">And Nidhug gnawed upon its root ; then were loosed</l>
     <l n="110">The powers of aged night . The Midgard serpent flung</l>
     <l n="111">Toward heaven its poison-swollen tail , and Fenris howled ,</l>
     <l n="112">And Surt 's swift fire-sword flashing gleamed from Muspelheim .</l>
     <l n="113">Since then wherever thou mayest look the strife goes on ,</l>
     <l n="114">A war throughout creation . In Valhal crows</l>
     <l n="115">The cock with goldcn comb . Upon and ‘ neath the earth</l>
     <l n="116">The blood-red cock to battle calls . There once was peace</l>
     <l n="117">Not only where gods dwell , but also on the earth ;</l>
     <l n="118">In man 's as in the high gods ’ thoughts was peace .</l>
     <l n="119">Whate'er has happened here below has also chanced</l>
     <l n="120">In greater measure there ; humanity is but</l>
     <l n="121">An image frail of heaven ; it is as Valhal 's light</l>
     <l n="122">Reflected in the shield of Saga writ with runes .</l>
     <l n="123">Its Balder hath each heart . Remember'st thou the time</l>
     <l n="124">When dwelt within thy breast sweet peace a guest , and life</l>
     <l n="125">As joyful seemed , as heavenly calm , as song bird 's dream</l>
     <l n="126">When summer night-winds to and fro so gently wave</l>
     <l n="127">Each fragrant blossom sleeping in its bed of green ?</l>
     <l n="128">Then holy Balder still abode in thy pure soul ,</l>
     <l n="129">Thou asa-son , thou wandering image of high heaven .</l>
     <l n="130">For childhood Balder is not dead , and Hela gives</l>
     <l n="131">Again her prey us often as a child is born .</l>
     <l n="132">With Balder also groweth up in every soul</l>
     <l n="133">His brother Hoder , blind , the child of night ; for blind</l>
     <l n="134">At birth is evil always , like the young of bears , and night</l>
     <l n="135">Its mantle , but the good of earth rejoice in light .</l>
     <l n="136">The tempter , busy Loke , always ready stands</l>
     <l n="137">To guide the blind one 's murderous hand . The missile oft</l>
     <l n="138">To Valhal 's love is sent , to Balder 's tender breast .</l>
     <l n="139">Then Hate awakes and Violence upon its prey</l>
     <l n="140">Springs forth ; the hungry sword-wolf prowls o'er hill and dale .</l>
     <l n="141">And fiercest dragons wild swim o'er the bloody waves .</l>
     <l n="142">For this meek Piety a powerless shadow sits</l>
     <l n="143">One dead among the dead , and with him pallid Hel ,</l>
     <l n="144">And in its ashes Baldur 's sanctuary lies .</l>
     <l n="145">So too the asa 's life on high prefigures that</l>
     <l n="146">Mere human life below , and both are but the thoughts ,</l>
     <l n="147">The silent thoughts of Odin which can never change .</l>
     <l n="148">What hath been , what shall be , that the song profound</l>
     <l n="149">Of Vala knows ,— Time 's lullaby , its drapa too .</l>
     <l n="150">Creation 's annals have a melody the sam .</l>
     <l n="151">And man may hear his own life 's history therein .</l>
     <l n="152">Dost comprehend or not ? ‘ Tis Vala asketh thee .</l>
     <l n="153">Thou seek'st atonement ; know'st thou what atonement is ?</l>
     <l n="154">Oh , Fridthjof , look me in the eye and turn not pale !</l>
     <l n="155">Round earth a mediator goes , his name is Death .</l>
     <l n="156">A spark translucent , from eternity , is time :</l>
     <l n="157">All earthly life is but the refuse from Allfather 's throne ;</l>
     <l n="158">Atonement is to there return all purified .</l>
     <l n="159">The lofty asas fall themselves , and Ragnarok</l>
     <l n="160">The day of their atonement is , a bloody day</l>
     <l n="161">On Vigrid 's hundred miles of plain ; there will they fall ,</l>
     <l n="162">But fall not unavenged , for there the evil die</l>
     <l n="163">Forever , but the fallen good arise again ,</l>
     <l n="164">Refined , from out the flaming pyre to higher life .</l>
     <l n="165">‘ Tis true the star-crown , pale and withered , falleth down</l>
     <l n="166">From heaven 's temple ; earth too , sinks beneath the sea ,</l>
     <l n="167">But brighter is it born again , and joyous lifts</l>
     <l n="168">Its flower crowned head from out the seething waves ,—</l>
     <l n="169">And new created stars pursue with god-like glance</l>
     <l n="170">Their silent pathway round about the new-born earth .</l>
     <l n="171">But on the green hill-slopes will Balder govern then</l>
     <l n="172">The new-born asas , and a human race renewed .</l>
     <l n="173">The golden tablets filled with runes , lost long ago ,</l>
     <l n="174">In Time 's fresh morning , then are found amid the grass</l>
     <l n="175">On Ida 's plain , by Valhal 's children reconciled .</l>
     <l n="176">The fallen good in death are only tried by fire ;</l>
     <l n="177">It is atonement made , a birth to higher life ,</l>
     <l n="178">Which , purified , flies back to him from whom it came ,</l>
     <l n="179">And plays a guileless child upon its father 's knee .</l>
     <l n="180">Alas ! that all the best is found beyond the grave ,—</l>
     <l n="181">That gate of green which Gimle opens ; vile is all ,</l>
     <l n="182">Contaminated all that dwells beneath the stars .</l>
     <l n="183">And yet there is atonement found in life itself ,—</l>
     <l n="184">A humble prelude to the peace of heaven above .</l>
     <l n="185">‘ Tis like the broken chords the minstrel strikes upon</l>
     <l n="186">The harp , when he with skillful fingers wakes the song ;</l>
     <l n="187">The tone attuning with a gentle hand , before</l>
     <l n="188">With firmer touch he grasps the golden strings ,—</l>
     <l n="189">Grand memories of old alluring from their grave ,</l>
     <l n="190">While Valhal 's splendor streameth on enraptured eyes .</l>
     <l n="191">For earth , indeed , is only heaven 's shadow , life</l>
     <l n="192">The grounds in front of Balder 's temple in the sky .</l>
     <l n="193">The people sacrifice unto the gods ; the steed</l>
     <l n="194">Bedecked with gold and purple is an offering made .</l>
     <l n="195">A token this with meaning most profound ,— for blood</l>
     <l n="196">Tints red the morning light of each atonement day .</l>
     <l n="197">But signs are not the substitute , they can not atone ,</l>
     <l n="198">Thine own transgressions no one can amend for thee .</l>
     <l n="199">In Odin 's breast divine the dead are reconciled ;</l>
     <l n="200">Atonement for the living lies in their own hearts .</l>
     <l n="201">One offering , I know , unto the gods more dear</l>
     <l n="202">Than smoke of victims . ‘ Tis the sacrifice of thine</l>
     <l n="203">Own vengeance , and thy heart 's untamed and bitter hate .</l>
     <l n="204">Canst thou not silence them , and canst thou not forgive ,</l>
     <l n="205">O youth ? What wilt thou then in Balder 's sacred house ?</l>
     <l n="206">With what intent hast thou this holy temple reared ?</l>
     <l n="207">With stones is Balder not appeased . Atonement dwells</l>
     <l n="208">Below , as up above , alone where dwelleth peace .</l>
     <l n="209">With all thy foes and with thyself be reconciled .</l>
     <l n="210">The light-haired god will then be reconciled with thee .</l>
     <l n="211">They have a Balder in the south — the virgin 's son ,</l>
     <l n="212">Who by the Allfather wise was sent to explain the runes</l>
     <l n="213">Upon the norns ’ black shield rand ,— unexplained before .</l>
     <l n="214">His battle-cry was peace , his conquering sword was love ;</l>
     <l n="215">And blameless sat the dove upon his silver helm .</l>
     <l n="216">He holy lived and taught , he died and he forgave ,—</l>
     <l n="217">And under distant palms his grave in sunlight lies .</l>
     <l n="218">From dale to dale his followers wander , it is said .</l>
     <l n="219">And melting hardened hearts , and laying hand in hand</l>
     <l n="220">Establish peace upon the reconciled earth .</l>
     <l n="221">I do not know the doctrine well , but dimly have I</l>
     <l n="222">In my better moments guessed what it may mean ,—</l>
     <l n="223">And every human heart at times divines as well .</l>
     <l n="224">I know the time will come when it will lightly wave</l>
     <l n="225">Its white dove-pinions over all our northern hills ;</l>
     <l n="226">But that day come , the North will be no more to us ;</l>
     <l n="227">The oaks will sigh above our long-forgotten graves .</l>
     <l n="228">Oh , fortunate and blessed race ! Ye who shall drink</l>
     <l n="229">The sparkling beaker of that light , I bid you hail !</l>
     <l n="230">It will be well if it can drive away the cloud</l>
     <l n="231">Whose humid covering hitherto has veiled life 's sun .</l>
     <l n="232">But scorn not us , who , in sincerity , have sought</l>
     <l n="233">With unaverted gaze to find the light divine .</l>
     <l n="234">The Allfather is but one , though many herald him .</l>

     <l n="235">“ Thou hatest Bele 's sons . And wherefore hatest thou ?</l>
     <l n="236">Because to thee , a yeoman 's son , they did not choose</l>

     <l n="238">The noble son of all-wise Odin . Their descent extends</l>

     <l n="257">“ Thou canst but know</l>
     <l n="258">That while thou here wert building , he was on the march</l>
     <l n="259">Among the Finnish mountains . On a lonely crag</l>
     <l n="260">There stood an ancient shrine . To Jumala ‘ twas built</l>
     <l n="261">Abandoned long ago ,— the door was now fast closed ;</l>
     <l n="262">But just above the portal still there stood a strange</l>
     <l n="263">Old image of the god , now tottering to its fall .</l>
     <l n="264">But no one dare approach , for there a saying rife</l>
     <l n="265">Among the people went from age to age , that he</l>
     <l n="266">Who first the temple sought should Jumala behold .</l>
     <l n="267">This Helge heard , and , blinded by his furious wrath ,</l>
     <l n="268">Went up the ruined steps against the hated god ,—</l>
     <l n="269">Intent to cast the temple down . When there arrived</l>
     <l n="270">The gate was closed ,— the key fast rusted in the lock .</l>
     <l n="271">Then grasping both the door-posts , hard and fierce he shook</l>
     <l n="272">The rotten pillars . All at once , with horrid crash ,</l>
     <l n="273">Down fell the ponderous image , crushing in its fall</l>
     <l n="274">The Valhal-son . And thus he Jumala beheld .</l>
     <l n="275">A messenger last night arrived the tidings bore .</l>
     <l n="276">Now Halfdan sits alone on Bele 's throne . To him</l>
