    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">The following Tale is principally taken from the admirable Work of Madame de Beaumont ( Le Magazin des Enfans ) , which formed almost the whole library and the delight of the children of the last generation , and has hardly been surpassed by the many excellent productions which supply the nurseries and school-rooms of the present .</p>
    <p n="2">The story is there told with the simplicity and sprightliness of which the French language is so peculiarly capable , but which a literal translation would render not only insipid but vulgar .</p>
    <p n="3">In a poetical dress it may possibly give to the young reader a part of that amusement , which it once afforded the infancy of the author .</p>

     <l n="2">The sun withdrew his last pale ray ,</l>
     <l n="3">And clos 'd the short and chearless day ;</l>
     <l n="4">Loud blew the wind , and rain and sleet</l>
     <l n="5">Against the cottage casement beat .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">The busy housewife trimm 'd her fire ,</l>
     <l n="7">And drew the oaken settle nigher ,</l>
     <l n="8">And welcom 'd home her own good man</l>
     <l n="9">To his clean hearth , his pipe , and can ;</l>
     <l n="10">For Homespun and his bustling wife</l>
     <l n="11">Were honest folks in humble life ,</l>
     <l n="12">Who liv 'd contented with their lot ,</l>
     <l n="13">And lov 'd the comforts of their cot .</l>
     <l n="14">With willing hand and chearful heart ,</l>
     <l n="15">Each of life 's burden bore their part ,</l>
     <l n="16">With patience all its ills withstood ,</l>
     <l n="17">And thankfully receiv 'd the good .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="18">Yet , they were not without their failings :</l>
     <l n="19">They lov 'd the harvest-home regalings ;</l>
     <l n="20">On summer evenings on the green</l>
     <l n="21">At cricket oft was Homespun seen ;</l>
     <l n="22">And sometimes , where the sign ensnares</l>
     <l n="23">The wearied swain to drown his cares ,</l>
     <l n="24">He lov 'd to quaff the foaming ale ,</l>
     <l n="25">And listen to a merry tale .</l>
     <l n="26">Was there within ten miles a fair —</l>
     <l n="27">He and his dame were surely there :</l>
     <l n="28">For she too lov 'd , in trim array ,</l>
     <l n="29">And scarlet cloak , a holiday .</l>
     <l n="30">Ah ! then within her pocket burn 'd</l>
     <l n="31">The long sav 'd crown so hardly earn 'd ,</l>
     <l n="32">While in the stall temptation spread</l>
     <l n="33">The printed gown or top-knot red ;</l>
     <l n="34">Nor did her little happy train</l>
     <l n="35">For drum or whistle sue in vain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="36">Will Rigour 's brow relentless lour ,</l>
     <l n="37">If pleasure steal from toil one hour ?</l>
     <l n="38">And shall the poor enjoy no ray</l>
     <l n="39">Of sunshine through their winter 's day ?</l>
     <l n="40">Nor pluck the few wild flowers , that bloom</l>
     <l n="41">‘ Midst poverty 's ungenial gloom ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="42">Now , seated in his wicker chair ,</l>
     <l n="43">The swain enjoys his homely fare :</l>
     <l n="44">His rosy children round him press ,</l>
     <l n="45">Eager to share the fond caress ;</l>
     <l n="46">And as his eyes delighted trace</l>
     <l n="47">Health and content in each dear face ,</l>
     <l n="48">He scarce desires a happier lot ,</l>
     <l n="49">His toils unfelt , his cares forgot .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="50">When supper ended ,— grace was said ,</l>
     <l n="51">The babes were bless 'd , and sent to bed ,</l>
     <l n="52">And o'er the fire the parents sat ,</l>
     <l n="53">Engag 'd in sober , social chat ,—</l>
     <l n="54">When suddenly a flash of light</l>
     <l n="55">Reveal 'd to their astonish 'd sight</l>
     <l n="56">A little form of lovely mien ,</l>
     <l n="57">Epitome of Beauty 's Queen .</l>
     <l n="58">Her zone was clasp 'd with jewels rare ,</l>
     <l n="59">And roses bound her auburn hair ,</l>
     <l n="60">White was her robe , and in her hand</l>
     <l n="61">Graceful she wav 'd an ivory wand .</l>

     <l n="66">What was her nature , or her name .</l>

     <l n="89">When winter stern in icy chains</l>
     <l n="90">Had bound the desolated plains ,</l>
     <l n="91">And withered every tender plant ,</l>
     <l n="92">A hare , compelled by urgent want ,</l>
     <l n="93">Ventured within your garden pale</l>
     <l n="94">To taste your parsley and your kale .</l>
     <l n="95">Soon of her steps you saw the trace ,</l>
     <l n="96">And whistled Fury to the chace .</l>
     <l n="97">The fatal scent her track reveals ,</l>
     <l n="98">And the fierce cur pursued her heels ;</l>
     <l n="99">Vain was her speed ! her failing breath</l>
     <l n="100">Left her within the jaws of death ,</l>
     <l n="101">When doubling quick , thus sorely prest ,</l>
     <l n="102">She sprang for shelter to your breast .</l>
     <l n="103">That breast , awake to pity 's plea ,</l>
     <l n="104">My kind protector ! rescued me :</l>

   <p>Nay , said her mate — it sha n't be so — I 'd sooner our last hope forego . Our third wish will your peace restore , We are but where we were before . I will my luckless wish revoke , Recall the words I rashly spoke , And to relieve you from this evil , I WISH THE PUDDING AT THE DEVIL !</p>

   <p>Quoth Homespun — To my mind , my dame , A tricking fairy is that same ! Why did she meddle thus about us ? To tempt us first , and then to flout us ?— But let us not complain , my Sue ; The fairy to her word was true , And if our schemes are overthrown , In faith , the fault is all our own . A wholesome lesson she has taught , Though it is somewhat dearly bought , And should she call another day , She 'll find it is not thrown away — For as we have regained our senses , We 'll lay aside our vain pretences , Temper our hopes with moderation , AND SUIT OUR WISHES TO OUR STATION .</p>
   <p>THE END .</p>
