    <p>TO HIS EXCELLENCY PRINCE ALEXANDER MAVROCORDATO LATE SECRETARY FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS TO THE HOSPODAR OF WALLACHIA THE DRAMA OF HELLAS IS INSCRIBED AS AN IMPERFECT TOKEN OF THE ADMIRATION , SYMPATHY , AND FRIENDSHIP OF THE AUTHOR .</p>

    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">The poem of “ Hellas ” , written at the suggestion of the events of the moment , is a mere improvise , and derives its interest ( should it be found to possess any ) solely from the intense sympathy which the Author feels with the cause he would celebrate .</p>
    <p n="2">The subject , in its present state , is insusceptible of being treated otherwise than lyrically , and if I have called this poem a drama from the circumstance of its being composed in dialogue , the licence is not greater than that which has been assumed by other poets who have called their productions epics , only because they have been divided into twelve or twenty-four books .</p>
    <p n="3">The “ Persae ” of Aeschylus afforded me the first model of my conception , although the decision of the glorious contest now waging in Greece being yet suspended forbids a catastrophe parallel to the return of Xerxes and the desolation of the Persians . I have , therefore , contented myself with exhibiting a series of lyric pictures , and with having wrought upon the curtain of futurity , which falls upon the unfinished scene , such figures of indistinct and visionary delineation as suggest the final triumph of the Greek cause as a portion of the cause of civilisation and social improvement .</p>
    <p n="4">The drama ( if drama it must be called ) is , however , so inartificial that I doubt whether , if recited on the Thespian waggon to an Athenian village at the Dionysiaca , it would have obtained the prize of the goat . I shall bear with equanimity any punishment , greater than the loss of such a reward , which the Aristarchi of the hour may think fit to inflict .</p>
    <p n="5">The only “ goat-song ” which I have yet attempted has , I confess , in spite of the unfavourable nature of the subject , received a greater and a more valuable portion of applause than I expected or than it deserved .</p>
    <p n="6">Common fame is the only authority which I can allege for the details which form the basis of the poem , and I must trespass upon the forgiveness of my readers for the display of newspaper erudition to which I have been reduced . Undoubtedly , until the conclusion of the war , it will be impossible to obtain an account of it sufficiently authentic for historical materials ; but poets have their privilege , and it is unquestionable that actions of the most exalted courage have been performed by the Greeks — that they have gained more than one naval victory , and that their defeat in Wallachia was signalized by circumstances of heroism more glorious even than victory .</p>
    <p n="7">The apathy of the rulers of the civilised world to the astonishing circumstance of the descendants of that nation to which they owe their civilisation , rising as it were from the ashes of their ruin , is something perfectly inexplicable to a mere spectator of the shows of this mortal scene . We are all Greeks . Our laws , our literature , our religion , our arts have their root in Greece . But for Greece — Rome , the instructor , the conqueror , or the metropolis of our ancestors , would have spread no illumination with her arms , and we might still have been savages and idolaters ; or , what is worse , might have arrived at such a stagnant and miserable state of social institution as China and Japan possess .</p>
    <p n="8">The human form and the human mind attained to a perfection in Greece which has impressed its image on those faultless productions , whose very fragments are the despair of modern art , and has propagated impulses which cannot cease , through a thousand channels of manifest or imperceptible operation , to ennoble and delight mankind until the extinction of the race .</p>
    <p n="9">The modern Greek is the descendant of those glorious beings whom the imagination almost refuses to figure to itself as belonging to our kind , and he inherits much of their sensibility , their rapidity of conception , their enthusiasm , and their courage . If in many instances he is degraded by moral and political slavery to the practice of the basest vices it engenders — and that below the level of ordinary degradation — let us reflect that the corruption of the best produces the worst , and that habits which subsist only in relation to a peculiar state of social institution may be expected to cease as soon as that relation is dissolved . In fact , the Greeks , since the admirable novel of Anastasius could have been a faithful picture of their manners , have undergone most important changes ; the flower of their youth , returning to their country from the universities of Italy , Germany , and France , have communicated to their fellow-citizens the latest results of that social perfection of which their ancestors were the original source . The University of Chios contained before the breaking out of the revolution eight hundred students , and among them several Germans and Americans . The munificence and energy of many of the Greek princes and merchants , directed to the renovation of their country with a spirit and a wisdom which has few examples , is above all praise .</p>
    <p n="10">The English permit their own oppressors to act according to their natural sympathy with the Turkish tyrant , and to brand upon their name the indelible blot of an alliance with the enemies of domestic happiness , of Christianity and civilisation .</p>
    <p n="11">Russia desires to possess , not to liberate Greece ; and is contented to see the Turks , its natural enemies , and the Greeks , its intended slaves , enfeeble each other until one or both fall into its net . The wise and generous policy of England would have consisted in establishing the independence of Greece , and in maintaining it both against Russia and the Turk ;— but when was the oppressor generous or just ?</p>
    <p n="12">[ Should the English people ever become free , they will reflect upon the part which those who presume to represent their will have played in the great drama of the revival of liberty , with feelings which it would become them to anticipate . This is the age of the war of the oppressed against the oppressors , and every one of those ringleaders of the privileged gangs of murderers and swindlers , called Sovereigns , look to each other for aid against the common enemy , and suspend their mutual jealousies in the presence of a mightier fear . Of this holy alliance all the despots of the earth are virtual members . But a new race has arisen throughout Europe , nursed in the abhorrence of the opinions which are its chains , and she will continue to produce fresh generations to accomplish that destiny which tyrants foresee and dread . ( This paragraph , suppressed in 1822 by Charles Ollier , was first restored in 1892 by Mr. Buxton Forman [ “ Poetical Works of P. B. S . ” , volume 4 pages 40-41 ] from a proof copy of Hellas in his possession . ]</p>
    <p n="13">The Spanish Peninsula is already free . France is tranquil in the enjoyment of a partial exemption from the abuses which its unnatural and feeble government are vainly attempting to revive . The seed of blood and misery has been sown in Italy , and a more vigorous race is arising to go forth to the harvest . The world waits only the news of a revolution of Germany to see the tyrants who have pinnacled themselves on its supineness precipitated into the ruin from which they shall never arise . Well do these destroyers of mankind know their enemy , when they impute the insurrection in Greece to the same spirit before which they tremble throughout the rest of Europe , and that enemy well knows the power and the cunning of its opponents , and watches the moment of their approaching weakness and inevitable division to wrest the bloody sceptres from their grasp .</p>

   <p>SATAN : Be as all things beneath the empyrean , 120 Mine ! Art thou eyeless like old Destiny , Thou mockery-king , crowned with a wreath of thorns ? Whose sceptre is a reed , the broken reed Which pierces thee ! whose throne a chair of scorn ; For seest thou not beneath this crystal floor 125 The innumerable worlds of golden light Which are my empire , and the least of them which thou wouldst redeem from me ? Know'st thou not them my portion ? Or wouldst rekindle the ... strife 130 Which our great Father then did arbitrate Which he assigned to his competing sons Each his apportioned realm ? Thou Destiny , Thou who art mailed in the omnipotence Of Him who tends thee forth , whate'er thy task , 135 Speed , spare not to accomplish , and be mine Thy trophies , whether Greece again become The fountain in the desert whence the earth Shall drink of freedom , which shall give it strength To suffer , or a gulf of hollow death 140 To swallow all delight , all life , all hope . Go , thou Vicegerent of my will , no less Than of the Father 's ; but lest thou shouldst faint , The winged hounds , Famine and Pestilence , Shall wait on thee , the hundred-forked snake 145 Insatiate Superstition still shall ... The earth behind thy steps , and War shall hover Above , and Fraud shall gape below , and Change Shall flit before thee on her dragon wings , Convulsing and consuming , and I add 150 Three vials of the tears which daemons weep When virtuous spirits through the gate of Death Pass triumphing over the thorns of life , Sceptres and crowns , mitres and swords and snares , Trampling in scorn , like Him and Socrates . 155 The first is Anarchy ; when Power and Pleasure , Glory and science and security , On Freedom hang like fruit on the green tree , Then pour it forth , and men shall gather ashes . The second Tyranny —</p>
   <p>CHRIST : Obdurate spirit ! 160 Thou seest but the Past in the To-come . Pride is thy error and thy punishment . Boast not thine empire , dream not that thy worlds Are more than furnace-sparks or rainbow-drops Before the Power that wields and kindles them . 165 True greatness asks not space , true excellence Lives in the Spirit of all things that live , Which lends it to the worlds thou callest thine .</p>
   <p>...</p>
   <p>MAHOMET : ... Haste thou and fill the waning crescent With beams as keen as those which pierced the shadow 170 Of Christian night rolled back upon the West , When the orient moon of Islam rode in triumph From Tmolus to the Acroceraunian snow .</p>

   <p>CHORUS OF GREEK CAPTIVE WOMEN : We strew these opiate flowers On thy restless pillow ,— They were stripped from Orient bowers , By the Indian billow . Be thy sleep 5 Calm and deep , Like theirs who fell — not ours who weep !</p>
   <p>INDIAN : Away , unlovely dreams ! Away , false shapes of sleep Be his , as Heaven seems , 10 Clear , and bright , and deep ! Soft as love , and calm as death , Sweet as a summer night without a breath .</p>

   <p>SEMICHORUS 1 : If Liberty Lent not life its soul of light , Hope its iris of delight , Truth its prophet 's robe to wear , Love its power to give and bear . 45</p>
   <p>CHORUS : In the great morning of the world , The Spirit of God with might unfurled The flag of Freedom over Chaos , And all its banded anarchs fled , Like vultures frighted from Imaus , 50 Before an earthquake 's tread .— So from Time 's tempestuous dawn Freedom 's splendour burst and shone :— Thermopylae and Marathon Caught like mountains beacon-lighted , 55 The springing Fire .— The winged glory On Philippi half-alighted , Like an eagle on a promontory . Its unwearied wings could fan The quenchless ashes of Milan . 60 From age to age , from man to man , It lived ; and lit from land to land Florence , Albion , Switzerland .</p>

   <p>MAHMUD [ STARTING FROM HIS SLEEP ]: Man the Seraglio-guard ! make fast the gate ! What ! from a cannonade of three short hours ? 115 ‘ Tis false ! that breach towards the Bosphorus Cannot be practicable yet — who stirs ? Stand to the match ; that when the foe prevails One spark may mix in reconciling ruin The conqueror and the conquered ! Heave the tower 120 Into the gap — wrench off the roof ! [ ENTER HASSAN . ] Ha ! what ! The truth of day lightens upon my dream And I am Mahmud still .</p>
   <p>HASSAN : Your Sublime Highness Is strangely moved .</p>
   <p>MAHMUD : The times do cast strange shadows On those who watch and who must rule their course , 125 Lest they , being first in peril as in glory , Be whelmed in the fierce ebb :— and these are of them . Thrice has a gloomy vision hunted me As thus from sleep into the troubled day ; It shakes me as the tempest shakes the sea , 130 Leaving no figure upon memory 's glass . Would that — no matter . Thou didst say thou knewest A Jew , whose spirit is a chronicle Of strange and secret and forgotten things . I bade thee summon him :— ‘ tis said his tribe 135 Dream , and are wise interpreters of dreams .</p>
   <p>HASSAN : The Jew of whom I spake is old ,— so old He seems to have outlived a world 's decay ; The hoary mountains and the wrinkled ocean Seem younger still than he ;— his hair and beard 140 Are whiter than the tempest-sifted snow ; His cold pale limbs and pulseless arteries Are like the fibres of a cloud instinct With light , and to the soul that quickens them Are as the atoms of the mountain-drift 145 To the winter wind :— but from his eye looks forth A life of unconsumed thought which pierces The Present , and the Past , and the To-come . Some say that this is he whom the great prophet Jesus , the son of Joseph , for his mockery , 150 Mocked with the curse of immortality . Some feign that he is Enoch : others dream He was pre-adamite and has survived Cycles of generation and of ruin . The sage , in truth , by dreadful abstinence 155 And conquering penance of the mutinous flesh , Deep contemplation , and unwearied study , In years outstretched beyond the date of man , May have attained to sovereignty and science Over those strong and secret things and thoughts 160 Which others fear and know not .</p>
   <p>MAHMUD : I would talk With this old Jew .</p>
   <p>HASSAN : Thy will is even now Made known to him , where he dwells in a sea-cavern ‘ Mid the Demonesi , less accessible Than thou or God ! He who would question him 165 Must sail alone at sunset , where the stream Of Ocean sleeps around those foamless isles , When the young moon is westering as now , And evening airs wander upon the wave ; And when the pines of that bee-pasturing isle , 170 Green Erebinthus , quench the fiery shadow Of his gilt prow within the sapphire water , Then must the lonely helmsman cry aloud ‘ Ahasuerus ! ’ and the caverns round Will answer ‘ Ahasuerus ! ’ If his prayer 175 Be granted , a faint meteor will arise Lighting him over Marmora , and a wind Will rush out of the sighing pine-forest , And with the wind a storm of harmony Unutterably sweet , and pilot him 180 Through the soft twilight to the Bosphorus : Thence at the hour and place and circumstance Fit for the matter of their conference The Jew appears . Few dare , and few who dare Win the desired communion — but that shout 185 Bodes —</p>

   <p>MAHMUD : More gold ? our ancestors bought gold with victory , And shall I sell it for defeat ?</p>
   <p>DAOOD : The Janizars 240 Clamour for pay .</p>
   <p>MAHMUD : Go ! bid them pay themselves With Christian blood ! Are there no Grecian virgins Whose shrieks and spasms and tears they may enjoy ? No infidel children to impale on spears ? No hoary priests after that Patriarch 245 Who bent the curse against his country 's heart , Which clove his own at last ? Go ! bid them kill , Blood is the seed of gold .</p>
   <p>DAOOD : It has been sown , And yet the harvest to the sicklemen Is as a grain to each .</p>
   <p>MAHMUD : Then , take this signet , 250 Unlock the seventh chamber in which lie The treasures of victorious Solyman ,— An empire 's spoil stored for a day of ruin . O spirit of my sires ! is it not come ? The prey-birds and the wolves are gorged and sleep ; 255 But these , who spread their feast on the red earth , Hunger for gold , which fills not .— See them fed ; Then , lead them to the rivers of fresh death . [ EXIT DAOOD . ] O miserable dawn , after a night More glorious than the day which it usurped ! 260 O faith in God ! O power on earth ! O word Of the great prophet , whose o'ershadowing wings Darkened the thrones and idols of the West , Now bright !— For thy sake cursed be the hour , Even as a father by an evil child , 265 When the orient moon of Islam rolled in triumph From Caucasus to White Ceraunia ! Ruin above , and anarchy below ; Terror without , and treachery within ; The Chalice of destruction full , and all 270 Thirsting to drink ; and who among us dares To dash it from his lips ? and where is Hope ?</p>
   <p>HASSAN : The lamp of our dominion still rides high ; One God is God — Mahomet is His prophet . Four hundred thousand Moslems , from the limits 275 Of utmost Asia , irresistibly Throng , like full clouds at the Sirocco 's cry ; But not like them to weep their strength in tears : They bear destroying lightning , and their step Wakes earthquake to consume and overwhelm , 280 And reign in ruin . Phrygian Olympus , Tmolus , and Latmos , and Mycale , roughen With horrent arms ; and lofty ships even now , Like vapours anchored to a mountain 's edge , Freighted with fire and whirlwind , wait at Scala 285 The convoy of the ever-veering wind . Samos is drunk with blood ;— the Greek has paid Brief victory with swift loss and long despair . The false Moldavian serfs fled fast and far When the fierce shout of ‘ Allah-illa-Allah ! ’ 290 Rose like the war-cry of the northern wind Which kills the sluggish clouds , and leaves a flock Of wild swans struggling with the naked storm . So were the lost Greeks on the Danube 's day ! If night is mute , yet the returning sun 295 Kindles the voices of the morning birds ; Nor at thy bidding less exultingly Than birds rejoicing in the golden day , The Anarchies of Africa unleash Their tempest-winged cities of the sea , 300 To speak in thunder to the rebel world . Like sulphurous clouds , half-shattered by the storm , They sweep the pale Aegean , while the Queen Of Ocean , bound upon her island-throne , Far in the West , sits mourning that her sons 305 Who frown on Freedom spare a smile for thee : Russia still hovers , as an eagle might Within a cloud , near which a kite and crane Hang tangled in inextricable fight , To stoop upon the victor ;— for she fears 310 The name of Freedom , even as she hates thine . But recreant Austria loves thee as the Grave Loves Pestilence , and her slow dogs of war Fleshed with the chase , come up from Italy , And howl upon their limits ; for they see 315 The panther , Freedom , fled to her old cover , Amid seas and mountains , and a mightier brood Crouch round . What Anarch wears a crown or mitre , Or bears the sword , or grasps the key of gold , Whose friends are not thy friends , whose foes thy foes ? 320 Our arsenals and our armouries are full ; Our forts defy assault ; ten thousand cannon Lie ranged upon the beach , and hour by hour Their earth-convulsing wheels affright the city ; The galloping of fiery steeds makes pale 325 The Christian merchant ; and the yellow Jew Hides his hoard deeper in the faithless earth . Like clouds , and like the shadows of the clouds , Over the hills of Anatolia , Swift in wide troops the Tartar chivalry 330 Sweep ;— the far flashing of their starry lances Reverberates the dying light of day . We have one God , one King , one Hope , one Law ; But many-headed Insurrection stands Divided in itself , and soon must fall . 335</p>

   <p>HASSAN : Even as that moon Renews itself —</p>
   <p>MAHMUD : Shall we be not renewed ! Far other bark than ours were needed now To stem the torrent of descending time : 350 The Spirit that lifts the slave before his lord Stalks through the capitals of armed kings , And spreads his ensign in the wilderness : Exults in chains ; and , when the rebel falls , Cries like the blood of Abel from the dust ; 355 And the inheritors of the earth , like beasts When earthquake is unleashed , with idiot fear Cower in their kingly dens — as I do now .

   <p>HASSAN : Ibrahim 's scimitar Drew with its gleam swift victory from Heaven , To burn before him in the night of battle — 365 A light and a destruction .</p>
   <p>MAHMUD : Ay ! the day Was ours : but how ?—</p>
   <p>HASSAN : The light Wallachians , The Arnaut , Servian , and Albanian allies Fled from the glance of our artillery Almost before the thunderstone alit . 370 One half the Grecian army made a bridge Of safe and slow retreat , with Moslem dead ; The other —</p>
   <p>MAHMUD : Speak — tremble not .—</p>
   <p>HASSAN : Islanded By victor myriads , formed in hollow square With rough and steadfast front , and thrice flung back 375 The deluge of our foaming cavalry ; Thrice their keen wedge of battle pierced our lines . Our baffled army trembled like one man Before a host , and gave them space ; but soon , From the surrounding hills , the batteries blazed , 380 Kneading them down with fire and iron rain : Yet none approached ; till , like a field of corn Under the hook of the swart sickleman , The band , intrenched in mounds of Turkish dead , Grew weak and few .— Then said the Pacha , ‘ Slaves , 385 Render yourselves — they have abandoned you — What hope of refuge , or retreat , or aid ? We grant your lives . ’ ‘ Grant that which is thine own ! ’ Cried one , and fell upon his sword and died ! Another — ‘ God , and man , and hope abandon me ; 390 But I to them , and to myself , remain Constant : ’ — he bowed his head , and his heart burst . A third exclaimed , ‘ There is a refuge , tyrant , Where thou darest not pursue , and canst not harm Shouldst thou pursue ; there we shall meet again . ’ 395 Then held his breath , and , after a brief spasm , The indignant spirit cast its mortal garment Among the slain — dead earth upon the earth ! So these survivors , each by different ways , Some strange , all sudden , none dishonourable , 400 Met in triumphant death ; and when our army Closed in , while yet wonder , and awe , and shame Held back the base hyaenas of the battle That feed upon the dead and fly the living , One rose out of the chaos of the slain : 405 And if it were a corpse which some dread spirit Of the old saviours of the land we rule Had lifted in its anger , wandering by ;— Or if there burned within the dying man Unquenchable disdain of death , and faith 410 Creating what it feigned ;— I cannot tell — But he cried , ‘ Phantoms of the free , we come ! Armies of the Eternal , ye who strike To dust the citadels of sanguine kings , And shake the souls throned on their stony hearts , 415 And thaw their frostwork diadems like dew ;— O ye who float around this clime , and weave The garment of the glory which it wears , Whose fame , though earth betray the dust it clasped , Lies sepulchred in monumental thought ;— 420 Progenitors of all that yet is great , Ascribe to your bright senate , O accept In your high ministrations , us , your sons — Us first , and the more glorious yet to come ! And ye , weak conquerors ! giants who look pale 425 When the crushed worm rebels beneath your tread , The vultures and the dogs , your pensioners tame , Are overgorged ; but , like oppressors , still They crave the relic of Destruction 's feast . The exhalations and the thirsty winds 430 Are sick with blood ; the dew is foul with death ; Heaven 's light is quenched in slaughter : thus , where'er Upon your camps , cities , or towers , or fleets , The obscene birds the reeking remnants cast Of these dead limbs ,— upon your streams and mountains , 435 Upon your fields , your gardens , and your housetops , Where'er the winds shall creep , or the clouds fly , Or the dews fall , or the angry sun look down With poisoned light — Famine , and Pestilence , And Panic , shall wage war upon our side ! 440 Nature from all her boundaries is moved Against ye : Time has found ye light as foam . The Earth rebels ; and Good and Evil stake Their empire o'er the unborn world of men On this one cast ;— but ere the die be thrown , 445 The renovated genius of our race , Proud umpire of the impious game , descends , A seraph-winged Victory , bestriding The tempest of the Omnipotence of God , Which sweeps all things to their appointed doom , 450 And you to oblivion ! ’ — More he would have said , But —</p>

   <p>HASSAN : My presence bore A part in that day 's shame . The Grecian fleet Bore down at daybreak from the North , and hung As multitudinous on the ocean line , As cranes upon the cloudless Thracian wind . 480 Our squadron , convoying ten thousand men , Was stretching towards Nauplia when the battle Was kindled .— First through the hail of our artillery The agile Hydriote barks with press of sail 485 Dashed :— ship to ship , cannon to cannon , man To man were grappled in the embrace of war , Inextricable but by death or victory . The tempest of the raging fight convulsed To its crystalline depths that stainless sea , 490 And shook Heaven 's roof of golden morning clouds , Poised on an hundred azure mountain-isles . In the brief trances of the artillery One cry from the destroyed and the destroyer Rose , and a cloud of desolation wrapped 495 The unforeseen event , till the north wind Sprung from the sea , lifting the heavy veil Of battle-smoke — then victory — victory ! For , as we thought , three frigates from Algiers Bore down from Naxos to our aid , but soon 500 The abhorred cross glimmered behind , before , Among , around us ; and that fatal sign Dried with its beams the strength in Moslem hearts , As the sun drinks the dew .— What more ? We fled !— Our noonday path over the sanguine foam 505 Was beaconed ,— and the glare struck the sun pale ,— By our consuming transports : the fierce light Made all the shadows of our sails blood-red , And every countenance blank . Some ships lay feeding The ravening fire , even to the water 's level ; 510 Some were blown up ; some , settling heavily , Sunk ; and the shrieks of our companions died Upon the wind , that bore us fast and far , Even after they were dead . Nine thousand perished ! We met the vultures legioned in the air 515 Stemming the torrent of the tainted wind ; They , screaming from their cloudy mountain-peaks , Stooped through the sulphurous battle-smoke and perched Each on the weltering carcase that we loved , Like its ill angel or its damned soul , 520 Riding upon the bosom of the sea . We saw the dog-fish hastening to their feast . Joy waked the voiceless people of the sea , And ravening Famine left his ocean cave To dwell with War , with us , and with Despair . 525 We met night three hours to the west of Patmos , And with night , tempest —</p>

The garrison of Patras 555 Has store but for ten days , nor is there hope But from the Briton : at once slave and tyrant , His wishes still are weaker than his fears , Or he would sell what faith may yet remain From the oaths broke in Genoa and in Norway ; 560 And if you buy him not , your treasury Is empty even of promises — his own coin . The freedman of a western poet-chief Holds Attica with seven thousand rebels , And has beat back the Pacha of Negropont : 565 The aged Ali sits in Yanina A crownless metaphor of empire : His name , that shadow of his withered might , Holds our besieging army like a spell In prey to famine , pest , and mutiny ; 570 He , bastioned in his citadel , looks forth Joyless upon the sapphire lake that mirrors The ruins of the city where he reigned Childless and sceptreless .

   <p>THIRD MESSENGER : The Christian tribes Of Lebanon and the Syrian wilderness Are in revolt ;— Damascus , Hems , Aleppo 580 Tremble ;— the Arab menaces Medina , The Aethiop has intrenched himself in Sennaar , And keeps the Egyptian rebel well employed , Who denies homage , claims investiture As price of tardy aid . Persia demands 585 The cities on the Tigris , and the Georgians Refuse their living tribute . Crete and Cyprus , Like mountain-twins that from each other 's veins Catch the volcano-fire and earthquake-spasm , Shake in the general fever . Through the city , 590 Like birds before a storm , the Santons shriek , And prophesyings horrible and new Are heard among the crowd : that sea of men Sleeps on the wrecks it made , breathless and still . A Dervise , learned in the Koran , preaches 595 That it is written how the sins of Islam Must raise up a destroyer even now . The Greeks expect a Saviour from the West , Who shall not come , men say , in clouds and glory , But in the omnipresence of that Spirit 600 In which all live and are . Ominous signs Are blazoned broadly on the noonday sky : One saw a red cross stamped upon the sun ; It has rained blood ; and monstrous births declare The secret wrath of Nature and her Lord . 605 The army encamped upon the Cydaris Was roused last night by the alarm of battle , And saw two hosts conflicting in the air , The shadows doubtless of the unborn time Cast on the mirror of the night . While yet 610 The fight hung balanced , there arose a storm Which swept the phantoms from among the stars . At the third watch the Spirit of the Plague Was heard abroad flapping among the tents ; Those who relieved watch found the sentinels dead . 615 The last news from the camp is , that a thousand Have sickened , and —</p>

   <p>FOURTH MESSENGER : One comes Fainting with toil , covered with foam and blood : He stood , he says , on Chelonites ’ 620 Promontory , which o'erlooks the isles that groan Under the Briton 's frown , and all their waters Then trembling in the splendour of the moon , When as the wandering clouds unveiled or hid Her boundless light , he saw two adverse fleets 625 Stalk through the night in the horizon 's glimmer , Mingling fierce thunders and sulphureous gleams , And smoke which strangled every infant wind That soothed the silver clouds through the deep air . At length the battle slept , but the Sirocco 630 Awoke , and drove his flock of thunder-clouds Over the sea-horizon , blotting out All objects — save that in the faint moon-glimpse He saw , or dreamed he saw , the Turkish admiral And two the loftiest of our ships of war , 635 With the bright image of that Queen of Heaven , Who hid , perhaps , her face for grief , reversed ; And the abhorred cross —</p>

I 'll hear no more ! too long 640 We gaze on danger through the mist of fear , And multiply upon our shattered hopes The images of ruin . Come what will ! To-morrow and to-morrow are as lamps Set in our path to light us to the edge 645 Through rough and smooth , nor can we suffer aught Which He inflicts not in whose hand we are .</p>

   <p>SEMICHORUS 1 : Where the rocks that gird th ’ Aegean 660 Echo to the battle paean Of the free — I would flee A tempestuous herald of victory ! My golden rain For the Grecian slain 665 Should mingle in tears with the bloody main , And my solemn thunder-knell Should ring to the world the passing-bell Of Tyranny ! 670</p>
   <p>SEMICHORUS 2 : Ah king ! wilt thou chain The rack and the rain ? Wilt thou fetter the lightning and hurricane ? The storms are free , But we — 675</p>
   <p>CHORUS : O Slavery ! thou frost of the world 's prime , Killing its flowers and leaving its thorns bare ! Thy touch has stamped these limbs with crime , These brows thy branding garland bear , But the free heart , the impassive soul 680 Scorn thy control !</p>
   <p>SEMICHORUS 1 : Let there be light ! said Liberty , And like sunrise from the sea , Athens arose !— Around her born , Shone like mountains in the morn 685 Glorious states ;— and are they now Ashes , wrecks , oblivion ?</p>
   <p>SEMICHORUS 2 : Go , Where Thermae and Asopus swallowed Persia , as the sand does foam : Deluge upon deluge followed , 690 Discord , Macedon , and Rome : And lastly thou !</p>
   <p>SEMICHORUS 1 : Temples and towers , Citadels and marts , and they Who live and die there , have been ours , And may be thine , and must decay ; 695 But Greece and her foundations are Built below the tide of war , Based on the crystalline sea Of thought and its eternity ; Her citizens , imperial spirits , 700 Rule the present from the past , On all this world of men inherits Their seal is set .</p>
   <p>SEMICHORUS 2 : Hear ye the blast , Whose Orphic thunder thrilling calls From ruin her Titanian walls ? 705 Whose spirit shakes the sapless bones Of Slavery ? Argos , Corinth , Crete Hear , and from their mountain thrones The daemons and the nymphs repeat The harmony .</p>
   <p>SEMICHORUS 1 : I hear ! I hear ! 710</p>
   <p>SEMICHORUS 2 : The world 's eyeless charioteer , Destiny , is hurrying by ! What faith is crushed , what empire bleeds Beneath her earthquake-footed steeds ? What eagle-winged victory sits 715 At her right hand ? what shadow flits Before ? what splendour rolls behind ? Ruin and renovation cry ‘ Who but We ? ’</p>
   <p>SEMICHORUS 1 : I hear ! I hear ! The hiss as of a rushing wind , 720 The roar as of an ocean foaming , The thunder as of earthquake coming . I hear ! I hear !

   <p>AHASUERUS : Thou sayest so . 740</p>
   <p>MAHMUD : Thou art an adept in the difficult lore Of Greek and Frank philosophy ; thou numberest The flowers , and thou measurest the stars ; Thou severest element from element ; Thy spirit is present in the Past , and sees 745 The birth of this old world through all its cycles Of desolation and of loveliness , And when man was not , and how man became The monarch and the slave of this low sphere , And all its narrow circles — it is much — 750 I honour thee , and would be what thou art Were I not what I am ; but the unborn hour , Cradled in fear and hope , conflicting storms , Who shall unveil ? Nor thou , nor I , nor any Mighty or wise . I apprehended not 755 What thou hast taught me , but I now perceive That thou art no interpreter of dreams ; Thou dost not own that art , device , or God , Can make the Future present — let it come ! Moreover thou disdainest us and ours ; 760 Thou art as God , whom thou contemplatest .</p>
   <p>AHASUERUS : Disdain thee ?— not the worm beneath thy feet ! The Fathomless has care for meaner things Than thou canst dream , and has made pride for those Who would be what they may not , or would seem 765 That which they are not . Sultan ! talk no more Of thee and me , the Future and the Past ; But look on that which cannot change — the One , The unborn and the undying . Earth and ocean , Space , and the isles of life or light that gem 770 The sapphire floods of interstellar air , This firmament pavilioned upon chaos , With all its cressets of immortal fire , Whose outwall , bastioned impregnably Against the escape of boldest thoughts , repels them 775 As Calpe the Atlantic clouds — this Whole Of suns , and worlds , and men , and beasts , and flowers , With all the silent or tempestuous workings By which they have been , are , or cease to be , Is but a vision ;— all that it inherits 780 Are motes of a sick eye , bubbles and dreams ; Thought is its cradle and its grave , nor less The Future and the Past are idle shadows Of thought 's eternal flight — they have no being : Nought is but that which feels itself to be . 785</p>
   <p>NOTE : 762 thy edition 1822 ; my editions 1839 .</p>
   <p>MAHMUD : What meanest thou ? Thy words stream like a tempest Of dazzling mist within my brain — they shake The earth on which I stand , and hang like night On Heaven above me . What can they avail ? They cast on all things surest , brightest , best , 790 Doubt , insecurity , astonishment .</p>
   <p>AHASUERUS : Mistake me not ! All is contained in each . Dodona 's forest to an acorn 's cup Is that which has been , or will be , to that Which is — the absent to the present . Thought 795 Alone , and its quick elements , Will , Passion , Reason , Imagination , cannot die ; They are , what that which they regard appears , The stuff whence mutability can weave All that it hath dominion o'er , worlds , worms , 800 Empires , and superstitions . What has thought To do with time , or place , or circumstance ? Wouldst thou behold the Future ?— ask and have ! Knock and it shall be opened — look , and lo ! The coming age is shadowed on the Past 805 As on a glass .</p>
   <p>MAHMUD : Wild , wilder thoughts convulse My spirit — Did not Mahomet the Second Win Stamboul ?</p>
   <p>AHASUERUS : Thou wouldst ask that giant spirit The written fortunes of thy house and faith . Thou wouldst cite one out of the grave to tell 810 How what was born in blood must die .</p>

   <p>AHASUERUS : What hearest thou ?</p>
   <p>MAHMUD : A far whisper — Terrible silence .</p>
   <p>AHASUERUS : What succeeds ?</p>
   <p>MAHMUD : The sound As of the assault of an imperial city , 815 The hiss of inextinguishable fire , The roar of giant cannon ; the earthquaking Fall of vast bastions and precipitous towers , The shock of crags shot from strange enginery , The clash of wheels , and clang of armed hoofs , 820 And crash of brazen mail as of the wreck Of adamantine mountains — the mad blast Of trumpets , and the neigh of raging steeds , The shrieks of women whose thrill jars the blood , And one sweet laugh , most horrible to hear , 825 As of a joyous infant waked and playing With its dead mother 's breast , and now more loud The mingled battle-cry ,— ha ! hear I not ‘ En touto nike ! ’ ‘ Allah-illa-Allah ! ’ ?</p>
   <p>AHASUERUS : The sulphurous mist is raised — thou seest —</p>
   <p>MAHMUD : A chasm , 830 As of two mountains in the wall of Stamboul ; And in that ghastly breach the Islamites , Like giants on the ruins of a world , Stand in the light of sunrise . In the dust Glimmers a kingless diadem , and one 835 Of regal port has cast himself beneath The stream of war . Another proudly clad In golden arms spurs a Tartarian barb Into the gap , and with his iron mace Directs the torrent of that tide of men , 840 And seems — he is — Mahomet !</p>
   <p>AHASUERUS : What thou seest Is but the ghost of thy forgotten dream . A dream itself , yet less , perhaps , than that Thou call'st reality . Thou mayst behold How cities , on which Empire sleeps enthroned , 845 Bow their towered crests to mutability . Poised by the flood , e'en on the height thou holdest , Thou mayst now learn how the full tide of power Ebbs to its depths .— Inheritor of glory , Conceived in darkness , born in blood , and nourished 850 With tears and toil , thou seest the mortal throes Of that whose birth was but the same . The Past Now stands before thee like an Incarnation Of the To-come ; yet wouldst thou commune with That portion of thyself which was ere thou 855 Didst start for this brief race whose crown is death , Dissolve with that strong faith and fervent passion Which called it from the uncreated deep , Yon cloud of war , with its tempestuous phantoms Of raging death ; and draw with mighty will 860 The imperial shade hither .</p>

   <p>PHANTOM : I come Thence whither thou must go ! The grave is fitter To take the living than give up the dead ; Yet has thy faith prevailed , and I am here . The heavy fragments of the power which fell 865 When I arose , like shapeless crags and clouds , Hang round my throne on the abyss , and voices Of strange lament soothe my supreme repose , Wailing for glory never to return .— A later Empire nods in its decay : 870 The autumn of a greener faith is come , And wolfish change , like winter , howls to strip The foliage in which Fame , the eagle , built Her aerie , while Dominion whelped below . The storm is in its branches , and the frost 875 Is on its leaves , and the blank deep expects Oblivion on oblivion , spoil on spoil , Ruin on ruin :— Thou art slow , my son ; The Anarchs of the world of darkness keep A throne for thee , round which thine empire lies 880 Boundless and mute ; and for thy subjects thou , Like us , shalt rule the ghosts of murdered life , The phantoms of the powers who rule thee now — Mutinous passions , and conflicting fears , And hopes that sate themselves on dust , and die !— 885 Stripped of their mortal strength , as thou of thine . Islam must fall , but we will reign together Over its ruins in the world of death :— And if the trunk be dry , yet shall the seed Unfold itself even in the shape of that 890 Which gathers birth in its decay . Woe ! woe ! To the weak people tangled in the grasp Of its last spasms .</p>
   <p>MAHMUD : Spirit , woe to all ! Woe to the wronged and the avenger ! Woe To the destroyer , woe to the destroyed ! 895 Woe to the dupe , and woe to the deceiver ! Woe to the oppressed , and woe to the oppressor ! Woe both to those that suffer and inflict ; Those who are born and those who die ! but say , Imperial shadow of the thing I am , 900 When , how , by whom , Destruction must accomplish Her consummation !</p>
   <p>PHANTOM : Ask the cold pale Hour , Rich in reversion of impending death , When HE shall fall upon whose ripe gray hairs Sit Care , and Sorrow , and Infirmity — 905 The weight which Crime , whose wings are plumed with years , Leaves in his flight from ravaged heart to heart Over the heads of men , under which burthen They bow themselves unto the grave : fond wretch !

Come what may , The Future must become the Past , and I As they were to whom once this present hour , 925 This gloomy crag of time to which I cling , Seemed an Elysian isle of peace and joy Never to be attained .— I must rebuke This drunkenness of triumph ere it die , And dying , bring despair .

If numbers , wealth , or unfulfilling years , Or fate , can quell the free ! 975 Alas ! for Virtue , when Torments , or contumely , or the sneers Of erring judging men Can break the heart where it abides . Alas ! if Love , whose smile makes this obscure world splendid , 980 Can change with its false times and tides , Like hope and terror ,— Alas for Love !

Guide us far , far away , To climes where now veiled by the ardour of day Thou art hidden From waves on which weary Noon 1045 Faints in her summer swoon , Between kingless continents sinless as Eden , Around mountains and islands inviolably Pranked on the sapphire sea .</p>

   <p>NOTES .</p>
   <p>( 1 ) THE QUENCHLESS ASHES OF MILAN [ L. 60 ] .</p>
   <p>Milan was the centre of the resistance of the Lombard league against the Austrian tyrant . Frederic Barbarossa burnt the city to the ground , but liberty lived in its ashes , and it rose like an exhalation from its ruin . See Sismondi 's “ Histoire des Republiques Italiennes ” , a book which has done much towards awakening the Italians to an imitation of their great ancestors .</p>
   <p>( 2 ) THE CHORUS [ L. 197 ] .</p>
   <p>The popular notions of Christianity are represented in this chorus as true in their relation to the worship they superseded , and that which in all probability they will supersede , without considering their merits in a relation more universal . The first stanza contrasts the immortality of the living and thinking beings which inhabit the planets , and to use a common and inadequate phrase , “ clothe themselves in matter ” , with the transience of the noblest manifestations of the external world .</p>
   <p>The concluding verses indicate a progressive state of more or loss exalted existence , according to the degree of perfection which every distinct intelligence may have attained . Let it not be supposed that I mean to dogmatise upon a subject , concerning which all men are equally ignorant , or that I think the Gordian knot of the origin of evil can be disentangled by that or any similar assertions . The received hypothesis of a Being resembling men in the moral attributes of His nature , having called us out of non-existence , and after inflicting on us the misery of the commission of error , should superadd that of the punishment and the privations consequent upon it , still would remain inexplicable and incredible . That there is a true solution of the riddle , and that in our present state that solution is unattainable by us , are propositions which may be regarded as equally certain : meanwhile , as it is the province of the poet to attach himself to those ideas which exalt and ennoble humanity , let him be permitted to have conjectured the condition of that futurity towards which we are all impelled by an inextinguishable thirst for immortality . Until better arguments can be produced than sophisms which disgrace the cause , this desire itself must remain the strongest and the only presumption that eternity is the inheritance of every thinking being .</p>

   <p>A Greek who had been Lord Byron 's servant commands the insurgents in Attica . This Greek , Lord Byron informs me , though a poet and an enthusiastic patriot , gave him rather the idea of a timid and unenterprising person . It appears that circumstances make men what they are , and that we all contain the germ of a degree of degradation or of greatness whose connection with our character is determined by events .</p>

   <p>The manner of the invocation of the spirit of Mahomet the Second will be censured as over subtle . I could easily have made the Jew a regular conjuror , and the Phantom an ordinary ghost . I have preferred to represent the Jew as disclaiming all pretension , or even belief , in supernatural agency , and as tempting Mahmud to that state of mind in which ideas may be supposed to assume the force of sensations through the confusion of thought with the objects of thought , and the excess of passion animating the creations of imagination .</p>

   <p>( 7 ) THE CHORUS [ L. 1060 ] .</p>
   <p>The final chorus is indistinct and obscure , as the event of the living drama whose arrival it foretells . Prophecies of wars , and rumours of wars , etc ., may safely be made by poet or prophet in any age , but to anticipate however darkly a period of regeneration and happiness is a more hazardous exercise of the faculty which bards possess or feign . It will remind the reader ‘ magno NEC proximus intervallo ’ of Isaiah and Virgil , whose ardent spirits overleaping the actual reign of evil which we endure and bewail , already saw the possible and perhaps approaching state of society in which the ‘ lion shall lie down with the lamb , ’ and ‘ omnis feret omnia tellus . ’ Let these great names be my authority and my excuse .</p>
   <p>( 8 ) SATURN AND LOVE THEIR LONG REPOSE SHALL BURST [ L. 1090 ] .</p>
   <p>Saturn and Love were among the deities of a real or imaginary state of innocence and happiness . ALL those WHO FELL , or the Gods of Greece , Asia , and Egypt ; the ONE WHO ROSE , or Jesus Christ , at whose appearance the idols of the Pagan World wore amerced of their worship ; and the MANY UNSUBDUED , or the monstrous objects of the idolatry of China , India , the Antarctic islands , and the native tribes of America , certainly have reigned over the understandings of men in conjunction or in succession , during periods in which all we know of evil has been in a state of portentous , and , until the revival of learning and the arts , perpetually increasing , activity . The Grecian gods seem indeed to have been personally more innocent , although it cannot be said , that as far as temperance and chastity are concerned , they gave so edifying an example as their successor . The sublime human character of Jesus Christ was deformed by an imputed identification with a Power , who tempted , betrayed , and punished the innocent beings who were called into existence by His sole will ; and for the period of a thousand years , the spirit of this most just , wise , and benevolent of men has been propitiated with myriads of hecatombs of those who approached the nearest to His innocence and wisdom , sacrificed under every aggravation of atrocity and variety of torture . The horrors of the Mexican , the Peruvian , and the Indian superstitions are well known .</p>
   <p>NOTE ON HELLAS , BY MRS. SHELLEY .</p>
   <p>The South of Europe was in a state of great political excitement at the beginning of the year 1821 . The Spanish Revolution had been a signal to Italy ; secrete societies were formed ; and , when Naples rose to declare the Constitution , the call was responded to from Brundusium to the foot of the Alps . To crush these attempts to obtain liberty , early in 1821 the Austrians poured their armies into the Peninsula : at first their coming rather seemed to add energy and resolution to a people long enslaved . The Piedmontese asserted their freedom ; Genoa threw off the yoke of the King of Sardinia ; and , as if in playful imitation , the people of the little state of Massa and Carrara gave the conge to their sovereign , and set up a republic .</p>
   <p>Tuscany alone was perfectly tranquil . It was said that the Austrian minister presented a list of sixty Carbonari to the Grand Duke , urging their imprisonment ; and the Grand Duke replied , ‘ I do not know whether these sixty men are Carbonari , but I know , if I imprison them , I shall directly have sixty thousand start up . ’ But , though the Tuscans had no desire to disturb the paternal government beneath whose shelter they slumbered , they regarded the progress of the various Italian revolutions with intense interest , and hatred for the Austrian was warm in every bosom . But they had slender hopes ; they knew that the Neapolitans would offer no fit resistance to the regular German troops , and that the overthrow of the constitution in Naples would act as a decisive blow against all struggles for liberty in Italy .</p>
   <p>We have seen the rise and progress of reform . But the Holy Alliance was alive and active in those days , and few could dream of the peaceful triumph of liberty . It seemed then that the armed assertion of freedom in the South of Europe was the only hope of the liberals , as , if it prevailed , the nations of the north would imitate the example . Happily the reverse has proved the fact . The countries accustomed to the exercise of the privileges of freemen , to a limited extent , have extended , and are extending , these limits . Freedom and knowledge have now a chance of proceeding hand in hand ; and , if it continue thus , we may hope for the durability of both . Then , as I have said — in 1821 — Shelley , as well as every other lover of liberty , looked upon the struggles in Spain and Italy as decisive of the destinies of the world , probably for centuries to come . The interest he took in the progress of affairs was intense . When Genoa declared itself free , his hopes were at their highest . Day after day he read the bulletins of the Austrian army , and sought eagerly to gather tokens of its defeat . He heard of the revolt of Genoa with emotions of transport . His whole heart and soul were in the triumph of the cause . We were living at Pisa at that time ; and several well-informed Italians , at the head of whom we may place the celebrated Vacca , were accustomed to seek for sympathy in their hopes from Shelley : they did not find such for the despair they too generally experienced , founded on contempt for their southern countrymen .</p>
   <p>While the fate of the progress of the Austrian armies then invading Naples was yet in suspense , the news of another revolution filled him with exultation . We had formed the acquaintance at Pisa of several Constantinopolitan Greeks , of the family of Prince Caradja , formerly Hospodar of Wallachia ; who , hearing that the bowstring , the accustomed finale of his viceroyalty , was on the road to him , escaped with his treasures , and took up his abode in Tuscany . Among these was the gentleman to whom the drama of “ Hellas ” is dedicated . Prince Mavrocordato was warmed by those aspirations for the independence of his country which filled the hearts of many of his countrymen . He often intimated the possibility of an insurrection in Greece ; but we had no idea of its being so near at hand , when , on the 1st of April 1821 , he called on Shelley , bringing the proclamation of his cousin , Prince Ypsilanti , and , radiant with exultation and delight , declared that henceforth Greece would be free .</p>
   <p>Shelley had hymned the dawn of liberty in Spain and Naples , in two odes dictated by the warmest enthusiasm ; he felt himself naturally impelled to decorate with poetry the uprise of the descendants of that people whose works he regarded with deep admiration , and to adopt the vaticinatory character in prophesying their success . “ Hellas ” was written in a moment of enthusiasm . It is curious to remark how well he overcomes the difficulty of forming a drama out of such scant materials . His prophecies , indeed , came true in their general , not their particular , purport . He did not foresee the death of Lord Londonderry , which was to be the epoch of a change in English politics , particularly as regarded foreign affairs ; nor that the navy of his country would fight for instead of against the Greeks , and by the battle of Navarino secure their enfranchisement from the Turks . Almost against reason , as it appeared to him , he resolved to believe that Greece would prove triumphant ; and in this spirit , auguring ultimate good , yet grieving over the vicissitudes to be endured in the interval , he composed his drama .</p>
   <p>“ Hellas ” was among the last of his compositions , and is among the most beautiful . The choruses are singularly imaginative , and melodious in their versification . There are some stanzas that beautifully exemplify Shelley 's peculiar style ; as , for instance , the assertion of the intellectual empire which must be for ever the inheritance of the country of Homer , Sophocles , and Plato :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ But Greece and her foundations are</l>
     <l n="2">Built below the tide of war ,</l>
     <l n="3">Based on the crystalline sea</l>
     <l n="4">Of thought and its eternity . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">And again , that philosophical truth felicitously imaged forth —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">‘ Revenge and Wrong bring forth their kind ,</l>
     <l n="7">The foul cubs like their parents are ,</l>
     <l n="8">Their den is in the guilty mind ,</l>
     <l n="9">And Conscience feeds them with despair . ’</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The conclusion of the last chorus is among the most beautiful of his lyrics . The imagery is distinct and majestic ; the prophecy , such as poets love to dwell upon , the Regeneration of Mankind — and that regeneration reflecting back splendour on the foregone time , from which it inherits so much of intellectual wealth , and memory of past virtuous deeds , as must render the possession of happiness and peace of tenfold value .</p>

   <p>The following fragments are part of a Drama undertaken for the amusement of the individuals who composed our intimate society , but left unfinished . I have preserved a sketch of the story as far as it had been shadowed in the poet 's mind .</p>
   <p>An Enchantress , living in one of the islands of the Indian Archipelago , saves the life of a Pirate , a man of savage but noble nature . She becomes enamoured of him ; and he , inconstant to his mortal love , for a while returns her passion ; but at length , recalling the memory of her whom he left , and who laments his loss , he escapes from the Enchanted Island , and returns to his lady . His mode of life makes him again go to sea , and the Enchantress seizes the opportunity to bring him , by a spirit-brewed tempest , back to her Island . — [ MRS. SHELLEY 'S NOTE , 1839 . ]</p>

   <p>SPIRIT : Within the silent centre of the earth 15 My mansion is ; where I have lived insphered From the beginning , and around my sleep Have woven all the wondrous imagery Of this dim spot , which mortals call the world ; Infinite depths of unknown elements 20 Massed into one impenetrable mask ; Sheets of immeasurable fire , and veins Of gold and stone , and adamantine iron . And as a veil in which I walk through Heaven I have wrought mountains , seas , and waves , and clouds , 25 And lastly light , whose interfusion dawns In the dark space of interstellar air .</p>

   <p>LADY : I offer only 30 That which I seek , some human sympathy In this mysterious island .</p>
   <p>INDIAN : Oh ! my friend , My sister , my beloved !— What do I say ? My brain is dizzy , and I scarce know whether I speak to thee or her .</p>
   <p>LADY : Peace , perturbed heart ! 35 I am to thee only as thou to mine , The passing wind which heals the brow at noon , And may strike cold into the breast at night , Yet cannot linger where it soothes the most , Or long soothe could it linger .</p>
   <p>INDIAN : But you said 40 You also loved ?</p>
   <p>NOTE : 32-41 Assigned to INDIAN , 1824 .</p>
   <p>LADY : Loved ! Oh , I love . Methinks This word of love is fit for all the world , And that for gentle hearts another name Would speak of gentler thoughts than the world owns . I have loved .</p>
   <p>INDIAN : And thou lovest not ? if so , 45 Young as thou art thou canst afford to weep .</p>
   <p>LADY : Oh ! would that I could claim exemption From all the bitterness of that sweet name . I loved , I love , and when I love no more Let joys and grief perish , and leave despair 50 To ring the knell of youth . He stood beside me , The embodied vision of the brightest dream , Which like a dawn heralds the day of life ; The shadow of his presence made my world A Paradise . All familiar things he touched , 55 All common words he spoke , became to me Like forms and sounds of a diviner world . He was as is the sun in his fierce youth , As terrible and lovely as a tempest ; He came , and went , and left me what I am . 60 Alas ! Why must I think how oft we two Have sate together near the river springs , Under the green pavilion which the willow Spreads on the floor of the unbroken fountain , Strewn , by the nurslings that linger there , 65 Over that islet paved with flowers and moss , While the musk-rose leaves , like flakes of crimson snow , Showered on us , and the dove mourned in the pine , Sad prophetess of sorrows not her own ? The crane returned to her unfrozen haunt , 70 And the false cuckoo bade the spray good morn ; And on a wintry bough the widowed bird , Hid in the deepest night of ivy-leaves , Renewed the vigils of a sleepless sorrow . I , left like her , and leaving one like her , 75 Alike abandoned and abandoning ( Oh ! unlike her in this ! ) the gentlest youth , Whose love had made my sorrows dear to him , Even as my sorrow made his love to me !</p>
   <p>NOTE : 71 spray Rossetti 1870 , Woodberry ; Spring Forman , Dowden .</p>
   <p>INDIAN : One curse of Nature stamps in the same mould 80 The features of the wretched ; and they are As like as violet to violet , When memory , the ghost , their odours keeps Mid the cold relics of abandoned joy .— Proceed .</p>
   <p>LADY : He was a simple innocent boy . 85 I loved him well , but not as he desired ; Yet even thus he was content to be :— A short content , for I was —</p>
   <p>INDIAN [ ASIDE ]: God of Heaven ! From such an islet , such a river-spring —! I dare not ask her if there stood upon it 90 A pleasure-dome surmounted by a crescent , With steps to the blue water . [ ALOUD . ] It may be That Nature masks in life several copies Of the same lot , so that the sufferers May feel another 's sorrow as their own , 95 And find in friendship what they lost in love . That cannot be : yet it is strange that we , From the same scene , by the same path to this Realm of abandonment — But speak ! your breath — Your breath is like soft music , your words are 100 The echoes of a voice which on my heart Sleeps like a melody of early days . But as you said —</p>
   <p>LADY : He was so awful , yet So beautiful in mystery and terror , Calming me as the loveliness of heaven 105 Soothes the unquiet sea :— and yet not so , For he seemed stormy , and would often seem A quenchless sun masked in portentous clouds ; For such his thoughts , and even his actions were ; But he was not of them , nor they of him , 110 But as they hid his splendour from the earth . Some said he was a man of blood and peril , And steeped in bitter infamy to the lips . More need was there I should be innocent , More need that I should be most true and kind , 115 And much more need that there should be found one To share remorse and scorn and solitude , And all the ills that wait on those who do The tasks of ruin in the world of life . He fled , and I have followed him .</p>
   <p>INDIAN : Such a one 120 Is he who was the winter of my peace . But , fairest stranger , when didst thou depart From the far hills where rise the springs of India ? How didst thou pass the intervening sea ?</p>
   <p>LADY : If I be sure I am not dreaming now , 125 I should not doubt to say it was a dream . Methought a star came down from heaven , And rested mid the plants of India , Which I had given a shelter from the frost Within my chamber . There the meteor lay , 130 Panting forth light among the leaves and flowers , As if it lived , and was outworn with speed ; Or that it loved , and passion made the pulse Of its bright life throb like an anxious heart , Till it diffused itself ; and all the chamber 135 And walls seemed melted into emerald fire That burned not ; in the midst of which appeared A spirit like a child , and laughed aloud A thrilling peal of such sweet merriment As made the blood tingle in my warm feet : 140 Then bent over a vase , and murmuring Low , unintelligible melodies , Placed something in the mould like melon-seeds , And slowly faded , and in place of it A soft hand issued from the veil of fire , 145 Holding a cup like a magnolia flower , And poured upon the earth within the vase The element with which it overflowed , Brighter than morning light , and purer than The water of the springs of Himalah . 150</p>
   <p>NOTE : 120-126 Such ... dream 1839 ; omitted 1824 .</p>
   <p>INDIAN : You waked not ?</p>
   <p>LADY : Not until my dream became Like a child 's legend on the tideless sand . Which the first foam erases half , and half Leaves legible . At length I rose , and went , Visiting my flowers from pot to pot , and thought 155 To set new cuttings in the empty urns , And when I came to that beside the lattice , I saw two little dark-green leaves Lifting the light mould at their birth , and then I half-remembered my forgotten dream . 160 And day by day , green as a gourd in June , The plant grew fresh and thick , yet no one knew What plant it was ; its stem and tendrils seemed Like emerald snakes , mottled and diamonded With azure mail and streaks of woven silver ; 165 And all the sheaths that folded the dark buds Rose like the crest of cobra-di-capel , Until the golden eye of the bright flower , Through the dark lashes of those veined lids , ... disencumbered of their silent sleep , 170 Gazed like a star into the morning light . Its leaves were delicate , you almost saw The pulses With which the purple velvet flower was fed To overflow , and like a poet 's heart 175 Changing bright fancy to sweet sentiment , Changed half the light to fragrance . It soon fell , And to a green and dewy embryo-fruit Left all its treasured beauty . Day by day I nursed the plant , and on the double flute 180 Played to it on the sunny winter days Soft melodies , as sweet as April rain On silent leaves , and sang those words in which Passion makes Echo taunt the sleeping strings ; And I would send tales of forgotten love 185 Late into the lone night , and sing wild songs Of maids deserted in the olden time , And weep like a soft cloud in April 's bosom Upon the sleeping eyelids of the plant , So that perhaps it dreamed that Spring was come , 190 And crept abroad into the moonlight air , And loosened all its limbs , as , noon by noon , The sun averted less his oblique beam .</p>
   <p>INDIAN : And the plant died not in the frost ?</p>
   <p>LADY : It grew ; And went out of the lattice which I left 195 Half open for it , trailing its quaint spires Along the garden and across the lawn , And down the slope of moss and through the tufts Of wild-flower roots , and stumps of trees o'ergrown With simple lichens , and old hoary stones , 200 On to the margin of the glassy pool , Even to a nook of unblown violets And lilies-of-the-valley yet unborn , Under a pine with ivy overgrown . And theme its fruit lay like a sleeping lizard 205 Under the shadows ; but when Spring indeed Came to unswathe her infants , and the lilies Peeped from their bright green masks to wonder at This shape of autumn couched in their recess , Then it dilated , and it grew until 210 One half lay floating on the fountain wave , Whose pulse , elapsed in unlike sympathies , Kept time Among the snowy water-lily buds . Its shape was such as summer melody 215 Of the south wind in spicy vales might give To some light cloud bound from the golden dawn To fairy isles of evening , and it seemed In hue and form that it had been a mirror Of all the hues and forms around it and 220 Upon it pictured by the sunny beams Which , from the bright vibrations of the pool , Were thrown upon the rafters and the roof Of boughs and leaves , and on the pillared stems Of the dark sylvan temple , and reflections 225 Of every infant flower and star of moss And veined leaf in the azure odorous air . And thus it lay in the Elysian calm Of its own beauty , floating on the line Which , like a film in purest space , divided 230 The heaven beneath the water from the heaven Above the clouds ; and every day I went Watching its growth and wondering ; And as the day grew hot , methought I saw A glassy vapour dancing on the pool , 235 And on it little quaint and filmy shapes . With dizzy motion , wheel and rise and fall , Like clouds of gnats with perfect lineaments .</p>

Canst thou discern The signs of seasons , yet perceive no hint Of change in that stage-scene in which thou art 35 Not a spectator but an actor ? or Art thou a puppet moved by [ enginery ] ? The day that dawns in fire will die in storms , Even though the noon be calm . My travel 's done ,— Before the whirlwind wakes I shall have found 40 My inn of lasting rest ; but thou must still Be journeying on in this inclement air . Wrap thy old cloak about thy back ; Nor leave the broad and plain and beaten road , Although no flowers smile on the trodden dust , 45 For the violet paths of pleasure . This Charles the First Rose like the equinoctial sun ,... By vapours , through whose threatening ominous veil Darting his altered influence he has gained This height of noon — from which he must decline 50 Amid the darkness of conflicting storms , To dank extinction and to latest night ... There goes The apostate Strafford ; he whose titles whispered aphorisms 55 From Machiavel and Bacon : and , if Judas Had been as brazen and as bold as he —</p>

   <p>SECOND CITIZEN : Rather say the Pope : London will be soon his Rome : he walks As if he trod upon the heads of men : 60 He looks elate , drunken with blood and gold ;— Beside him moves the Babylonian woman Invisibly , and with her as with his shadow , Mitred adulterer ! he is joined in sin , Which turns Heaven 's milk of mercy to revenge . 65</p>
   <p>THIRD CITIZEN [ LIFTING UP HIS EYES ]: Good Lord ! rain it down upon him !... Amid her ladies walks the papist queen , As if her nice feet scorned our English earth . The Canaanitish Jezebel ! I would be A dog if I might tear her with my teeth ! 70 There 's old Sir Henry Vane , the Earl of Pembroke , Lord Essex , and Lord Keeper Coventry , And others who make base their English breed By vile participation of their honours With papists , atheists , tyrants , and apostates . 75 When lawyers masque ‘ tis time for honest men To strip the vizor from their purposes . A seasonable time for masquers this ! When Englishmen and Protestants should sit dust on their dishonoured heads 80 To avert the wrath of Him whose scourge is felt For the great sins which have drawn down from Heaven and foreign overthrow . The remnant of the martyred saints in Rochefort Have been abandoned by their faithless allies 85 To that idolatrous and adulterous torturer Lewis of France ,— the Palatinate is lost — [ ENTER LEIGHTON ( WHO HAS BEEN BRANDED IN THE FACE ) AND BASTWICK . ] Canst thou be — art thou ?</p>

Here is the surfeit which to them who earn The niggard wages of the earth , scarce leaves 160 The tithe that will support them till they crawl Back to her cold hard bosom . Here is health Followed by grim disease , glory by shame , Waste by lame famine , wealth by squalid want , And England 's sin by England 's punishment . 165 And , as the effect pursues the cause foregone , Lo , giving substance to my words , behold At once the sign and the thing signified — A troop of cripples , beggars , and lean outcasts , Horsed upon stumbling jades , carted with dung , 170 Dragged for a day from cellars and low cabins And rotten hiding-holes , to point the moral Of this presentment , and bring up the rear Of painted pomp with misery !</p>

   <p>KING : Thanks , gentlemen . I heartily accept This token of your service : your gay masque Was performed gallantly . And it shows well When subjects twine such flowers of [ observance ? ] With the sharp thorns that deck the English crown . 5 A gentle heart enjoys what it confers , Even as it suffers that which it inflicts , Though Justice guides the stroke . Accept my hearty thanks .</p>

   <p>QUEEN : And gentlemen , Call your poor Queen your debtor . Your quaint pageant 10 Rose on me like the figures of past years , Treading their still path back to infancy , More beautiful and mild as they draw nearer The quiet cradle . I could have almost wept To think I was in Paris , where these shows 15 Are well devised — such as I was ere yet My young heart shared a portion of the burthen , The careful weight , of this great monarchy . There , gentlemen , between the sovereign 's pleasure And that which it regards , no clamour lifts 20 Its proud interposition . In Paris ribald censurers dare not move Their poisonous tongues against these sinless sports ; And HIS smile Warms those who bask in it , as ours would do 25 If ... Take my heart 's thanks : add them , gentlemen , To those good words which , were he King of France , My royal lord would turn to golden deeds .</p>
   <p>ST. JOHN : Madam , the love of Englishmen can make The lightest favour of their lawful king 30 Outweigh a despot 's .— We humbly take our leaves , Enriched by smiles which France can never buy .</p>

    <head>KING : My Lord Archbishop , Mark you what spirit sits in St. John 's eyes ? Methinks it is too saucy for this presence . 35</head>
    <head>ARCHY : Yes , pray your Grace look : for , like an unsophisticated [ eye ] sees everything upside down , you who are wise will discern the shadow of an idiot in lawn sleeves and a rochet setting springes to catch woodcocks in haymaking time . Poor Archy , whose owl-eyes are tempered to the error of his age , and because he is a fool , and by special ordinance of God forbidden ever to see himself as he is , sees now in that deep eye a blindfold devil sitting on the ball , and weighing words out between king and subjects . One scale is full of promises , and the other full of protestations : and then another devil creeps behind the first out of the dark windings [ of a ] pregnant lawyer 's brain , and takes the bandage from the other 's eyes , and throws a sword into the left-hand scale , for all the world like my Lord Essex 's there . 48</head>

   <p>STRAFFORD : Insolent ! You shall have your coat turned and be whipped out of the palace for this . 53</p>
   <p>ARCHY : When all the fools are whipped , and all the Protestant writers , while the knaves are whipping the fools ever since a thief was set to catch a thief . If all turncoats were whipped out of palaces , poor Archy would be disgraced in good company . Let the knaves whip the fools , and all the fools laugh at it . [ Let the ] wise and godly slit each other 's noses and ears ( having no need of any sense of discernment in their craft ) ; and the knaves , to marshal them , join in a procession to Bedlam , to entreat the madmen to omit their sublime Platonic contemplations , and manage the state of England . Let all the honest men who lie [ pinched ? ] up at the prisons or the pillories , in custody of the pursuivants of the High-Commission Court , marshal them . 65</p>

Do thou persist : for , faint but in resolve , And it were better thou hadst still remained 120 The slave of thine own slaves , who tear like curs The fugitive , and flee from the pursuer ; And Opportunity , that empty wolf , Flies at his throat who falls . Subdue thy actions Even to the disposition of thy purpose , 125 And be that tempered as the Ebro 's steel ; And banish weak-eyed Mercy to the weak , Whence she will greet thee with a gift of peace And not betray thee with a traitor 's kiss , As when she keeps the company of rebels , 130 Who think that she is Fear . This do , lest we Should fall as from a glorious pinnacle In a bright dream , and wake as from a dream Out of our worshipped state .</p>

   <p>KING : Beloved friend , God is my witness that this weight of power , 135 Which He sets me my earthly task to wield Under His law , is my delight and pride Only because thou lovest that and me . For a king bears the office of a God To all the under world ; and to his God 140 Alone he must deliver up his trust , Unshorn of its permitted attributes . [ It seems ] now as the baser elements Had mutinied against the golden sun That kindles them to harmony , and quells 145 Their self-destroying rapine . The wild million Strike at the eye that guides them ; like as humours Of the distempered body that conspire Against the spirit of life throned in the heart ,— And thus become the prey of one another , 150 And last of death —</p>
   <p>STRAFFORD : That which would be ambition in a subject Is duty in a sovereign ; for on him , As on a keystone , hangs the arch of life , Whose safety is its strength . Degree and form , 155 And all that makes the age of reasoning man More memorable than a beast 's , depend on this — That Right should fence itself inviolably With Power ; in which respect the state of England From usurpation by the insolent commons 160 Cries for reform . Get treason , and spare treasure . Fee with coin The loudest murmurers ; feed with jealousies Opposing factions ,— be thyself of none ; And borrow gold of many , for those who lend 165 Will serve thee till thou payest them ; and thus Keep the fierce spirit of the hour at bay , Till time , and its coming generations Of nights and days unborn , bring some one chance ,</p>

   <p>KING : Your words shall be my deeds : 190 You speak the image of my thought .

Be — as thou art within my heart and mind — Another self , here and in Ireland : Do what thou judgest well , take amplest licence , 200 And stick not even at questionable means . Hear me , Wentworth . My word is as a wall Between thee and this world thine enemy — That hates thee , for thou lovest me .</p>

   <p>KING : Peace , peace . Thou ow'st me nothing yet . [ TO LAUD . ] My lord , what say Those papers ?</p>
   <p>LAUD : Your Majesty has ever interposed , 210 In lenity towards your native soil , Between the heavy vengeance of the Church And Scotland . Mark the consequence of warming This brood of northern vipers in your bosom . The rabble , instructed no doubt 215 By London , Lindsay , Hume , and false Argyll ( For the waves never menace heaven until Scourged by the wind 's invisible tyranny ) , Have in the very temple of the Lord Done outrage to His chosen ministers . 220 They scorn the liturgy of the Holy Church , Refuse to obey her canons , and deny The apostolic power with which the Spirit Has filled its elect vessels , even from him Who held the keys with power to loose and bind , 225 To him who now pleads in this royal presence .— Let ample powers and new instructions be Sent to the High Commissioners in Scotland . To death , imprisonment , and confiscation , Add torture , add the ruin of the kindred 230 Of the offender , add the brand of infamy , Add mutilation : and if this suffice not , Unleash the sword and fire , that in their thirst They may lick up that scum of schismatics . I laugh at those weak rebels who , desiring 235 What we possess , still prate of Christian peace , As if those dreadful arbitrating messengers Which play the part of God ‘ twixt right and wrong , Should be let loose against the innocent sleep Of templed cities and the smiling fields , 240 For some poor argument of policy Which touches our own profit or our pride ( Where it indeed were Christian charity To turn the cheek even to the smiter 's hand ): And , when our great Redeemer , when our God , 245 When He who gave , accepted , and retained Himself in propitiation of our sins , Is scorned in His immediate ministry , With hazard of the inestimable loss Of all the truth and discipline which is 250 Salvation to the extremest generation Of men innumerable , they talk of peace ! Such peace as Canaan found , let Scotland now : For , by that Christ who came to bring a sword , Not peace , upon the earth , and gave command 255 To His disciples at the Passover That each should sell his robe and buy a sword , -  Once strip that minister of naked wrath , And it shall never sleep in peace again Till Scotland bend or break .</p>

   <p>KING : My Lord Archbishop , 260 Do what thou wilt and what thou canst in this . Thy earthly even as thy heavenly King Gives thee large power in his unquiet realm . But we want money , and my mind misgives me That for so great an enterprise , as yet , 265 We are unfurnished .</p>
   <p>STRAFFORD : Yet it may not long Rest on our wills .</p>
   <p>COTTINGTON : The expenses Of gathering shipmoney , and of distraining For every petty rate ( for we encounter A desperate opposition inch by inch 270 In every warehouse and on every farm ) , Have swallowed up the gross sum of the imposts ; So that , though felt as a most grievous scourge Upon the land , they stand us in small stead As touches the receipt .</p>
   <p>STRAFFORD : ‘ Tis a conclusion 275 Most arithmetical : and thence you infer Perhaps the assembling of a parliament . Now , if a man should call his dearest enemies T0 sit in licensed judgement on his life , His Majesty might wisely take that course . 280 [ ASIDE TO COTTINGTON . ] It is enough to expect from these lean imposts That they perform the office of a scourge , Without more profit . [ ALOUD . ] Fines and confiscations , And a forced loan from the refractory city , Will fill our coffers : and the golden love 285 Of loyal gentlemen and noble friends For the worshipped father of our common country , With contributions from the catholics , Will make Rebellion pale in our excess . Be these the expedients until time and wisdom 290 Shall frame a settled state of government .</p>
   <p>LAUD : And weak expedients they ! Have we not drained All , till the ... which seemed A mine exhaustless ?</p>
   <p>STRAFFORD : And the love which IS , If loyal hearts could turn their blood to gold . 295</p>
   <p>LAUD : Both now grow barren : and I speak it not As loving parliaments , which , as they have been In the right hand of bold bad mighty kings The scourges of the bleeding Church , I hate . Methinks they scarcely can deserve our fear . 300</p>
   <p>STRAFFORD : Oh ! my dear liege , take back the wealth thou gavest : With that , take all I held , but as in trust For thee , of mine inheritance : leave me but This unprovided body for thy service , And a mind dedicated to no care 305 Except thy safety :— but assemble not A parliament . Hundreds will bring , like me , Their fortunes , as they would their blood , before —</p>
   <p>KING : No ! thou who judgest them art but one . Alas ! We should be too much out of love with Heaven , 310 Did this vile world show many such as thee , Thou perfect , just , and honourable man ! Never shall it be said that Charles of England Stripped those he loved for fear of those he scorns ; Nor will he so much misbecome his throne 315 As to impoverish those who most adorn And best defend it . That you urge , dear Strafford , Inclines me rather —</p>
   <p>QUEEN : To a parliament ? Is this thy firmness ? and thou wilt preside Over a knot of ... censurers , 320 To the unswearing of thy best resolves , And choose the worst , when the worst comes too soon ? Plight not the worst before the worst must come . Oh , wilt thou smile whilst our ribald foes , Dressed in their own usurped authority , 325 Sharpen their tongues on Henrietta 's fame ? It is enough ! Thou lovest me no more ! [ WEEPS . ]</p>
   <p>KING : Oh , Henrietta !</p>
   <p>[ THEY TALK APART . ]</p>
   <p>COTTINGTON [ TO LAUD ]: Money we have none : And all the expedients of my Lord of Strafford Will scarcely meet the arrears .</p>
   <p>LAUD : Without delay 330 An army must be sent into the north ; Followed by a Commission of the Church , With amplest power to quench in fire and blood , And tears and terror , and the pity of hell , The intenser wrath of Heresy . God will give 335 Victory ; and victory over Scotland give The lion England tamed into our hands . That will lend power , and power bring gold .</p>
   <p>COTTINGTON : Meanwhile We must begin first where your Grace leaves off . Gold must give power , or —</p>
   <p>LAUD : I am not averse 340 From the assembling of a parliament . Strong actions and smooth words might teach them soon The lesson to obey . And are they not A bubble fashioned by the monarch 's mouth , The birth of one light breath ? If they serve no purpose , 345 A word dissolves them .</p>
   <p>STRAFFORD : The engine of parliaments Might be deferred until I can bring over The Irish regiments : they will serve to assure The issue of the war against the Scots . And , this game won — which if lost , all is lost — 350 Gather these chosen leaders of the rebels , And call them , if you will , a parliament .</p>
   <p>KING : Oh , be our feet still tardy to shed blood . Guilty though it may be ! I would still spare The stubborn country of my birth , and ward 355 From countenances which I loved in youth The wrathful Church 's lacerating hand . [ TO LAUD . ] Have you o'erlooked the other articles ?</p>

   <p>[ COTTINGTON ? ]: So please your Majesty to sign this order For their detention .</p>
   <p>ARCHY : If your Majesty were tormented night and day by fever , gout , rheumatism , and stone , and asthma , etc ., and you found these diseases had secretly entered into a conspiracy to abandon you , should you think it necessary to lay an embargo on the port by which they meant to dispeople your unquiet kingdom of man ? 383</p>
   <p>KING : If fear were made for kings , the Fool mocks wisely ; But in this case — [ WRITING ] . Here , my lord , take the warrant , And see it duly executed forthwith .— That imp of malice and mockery shall be punished . 387</p>

    <head>ARCHY : Ay , I am the physician of whom Plato prophesied , who was to be accused by the confectioner before a jury of children , who found him guilty without waiting for the summing-up , and hanged him without benefit of clergy . Thus Baby Charles , and the Twelfth-night Queen of Hearts , and the overgrown schoolboy Cottington , and that little urchin Laud — who would reduce a verdict of ‘ guilty , death , ’ by famine , if it were impregnable by composition — all impannelled against poor Archy for presenting them bitter physic the last day of the holidays . 397</head>

     <l n="2">Is the rain over , sirrah ?</l>

   <p>KING : When it rains And the sun shines , ‘ twill rain again to-morrow : And therefore never smile till you 've done crying . 400</p>
   <p>ARCHY : But ‘ tis all over now : like the April anger of woman , the gentle sky has wept itself serene .</p>
   <p>QUEEN : What news abroad ? how looks the world this morning ?</p>
   <p>ARCHY : Gloriously as a grave covered with virgin flowers . There 's a rainbow in the sky . Let your Majesty look at it , for</p>

     <l n="1">‘ A rainbow in the morning 407</l>
     <l n="2">Is the shepherd 's warning ; ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>and the flocks of which you are the pastor are scattered among the mountain-tops , where every drop of water is a flake of snow , and the breath of May pierces like a January blast . 411</p>
   <p>KING : The sheep have mistaken the wolf for their shepherd , my poor boy ; and the shepherd , the wolves for their watchdogs .</p>
   <p>QUEEN : But the rainbow was a good sign , Archy : it says that the waters of the deluge are gone , and can return no more .</p>
   <p>ARCHY : Ay , the salt-water one : but that of tears and blood must yet come down , and that of fire follow , if there be any truth in lies .— The rainbow hung over the city with all its shops ,... and churches , from north to south , like a bridge of congregated lightning pieced by the masonry of heaven — like a balance in which the angel that distributes the coming hour was weighing that heavy one whose poise is now felt in the lightest hearts , before it bows the proudest heads under the meanest feet . 424</p>
   <p>QUEEN : Who taught you this trash , sirrah ?</p>
   <p>ARCHY : A torn leaf out of an old book trampled in the dirt .— But for the rainbow . It moved as the sun moved , and ... until the top of the Tower ... of a cloud through its left-hand tip , and Lambeth Palace look as dark as a rock before the other . Methought I saw a crown figured upon one tip , and a mitre on the other . So , as I had heard treasures were found where the rainbow quenches its points upon the earth , I set off , and at the Tower — But I shall not tell your Majesty what I found close to the closet-window on which the rainbow had glimmered .</p>
   <p>KING : Speak : I will make my Fool my conscience . 435</p>
   <p>ARCHY : Then conscience is a fool .— I saw there a cat caught in a rat-trap . I heard the rats squeak behind the wainscots : it seemed to me that the very mice were consulting on the manner of her death .</p>
   <p>QUEEN : Archy is shrewd and bitter .</p>
   <p>ARCHY : Like the season , 440 So blow the winds .— But at the other end of the rainbow , where the gray rain was tempered along the grass and leaves by a tender interfusion of violet and gold in the meadows beyond Lambeth , what think you that I found instead of a mitre ?</p>
   <p>KING : Vane 's wits perhaps . 445</p>
   <p>ARCHY : Something as vain . I saw a gross vapour hovering in a stinking ditch over the carcass of a dead ass , some rotten rags , and broken dishes — the wrecks of what once administered to the stuffing-out and the ornament of a worm of worms . His Grace of Canterbury expects to enter the New Jerusalem some Palm Sunday in triumph on the ghost of this ass . 451</p>

   <p>KING : Oh , no ! 460 He is but Occasion 's pupil .

And you shall see A cradled miniature of yourself asleep , Stamped on the heart by never-erring love ; Liker than any Vandyke ever made , 480 A pattern to the unborn age of thee , Over whose sweet beauty I have wept for joy A thousand times , and now should weep for sorrow , Did I not think that after we were dead Our fortunes would spring high in him , and that 485 The cares we waste upon our heavy crown Would make it light and glorious as a wreath Of Heaven 's beams for his dear innocent brow .</p>

If , like the prelates , I 10 Were an invader of the royal power A public scorner of the word of God , Profane , idolatrous , popish , superstitious , Impious in heart and in tyrannic act , Void of wit , honesty , and temperance ; 15 If Satan were my lord , as theirs ,— our God Pattern of all I should avoid to do ; Were I an enemy of my God and King And of good men , as ye are ;— I should merit Your fearful state and gilt prosperity , 20 Which , when ye wake from the last sleep , shall turn To cowls and robes of everlasting fire . But , as I am , I bid ye grudge me not The only earthly favour ye can yield , Or I think worth acceptance at your hands ,— 25 Scorn , mutilation , and imprisonment . even as my Master did , Until Heaven 's kingdom shall descend on earth , Or earth be like a shadow in the light Of Heaven absorbed — some few tumultuous years 30 Will pass , and leave no wreck of what opposes His will whose will is power .</p>

Beyond the curses , calumnies , and [ lies ? ] Of atheist priests ! ... And thou Fair star , whose beam lies on the wide Atlantic , Athwart its zones of tempest and of calm , 20 Bright as the path to a beloved home Oh , light us to the isles of the evening land ! Like floating Edens cradled in the glimmer Of sunset , through the distant mist of years Touched by departing hope , they gleam ! lone regions , 25 Where Power 's poor dupes and victims yet have never Propitiated the savage fear of kings With purest blood of noblest hearts ; whose dew Is yet unstained with tears of those who wake To weep each day the wrongs on which it dawns ; 30 Whose sacred silent air owns yet no echo Of formal blasphemies ; nor impious rites Wrest man 's free worship , from the God who loves , To the poor worm who envies us His love ! Receive , thou young ... of Paradise . 35 These exiles from the old and sinful world !</p>

    <head>THE TRIUMPH OF LIFE .</head>
    <note>Composed at Lerici on the Gulf of Spezzia in the spring and early summer of 1822 — the poem on which Shelley was engaged at the time of his death . Published by Mrs. Shelley in the “ Posthumous Poems ” of 1824 , pages 73-95 . Several emendations , the result of Dr. Garnett 's examination of the Boscombe manuscript , were given to the world by Miss Mathilde Blind , “ Westminster Review ” , July , 1870 .

   <p>NOTE ON POEMS OF 1822 , BY MRS. SHELLEY .</p>
   <p>EARLY POEMS [ 1814 , 1815 ] .</p>
   <note>The poems which follow appeared , with a few exceptions , either in the volumes published from time to time by Shelley himself , or in the “ Posthumous Poems ” of 1824 , or in the “ Poetical Works ” of 1839 , of which a second and enlarged edition was published by Mrs. Shelley in the same year . A few made their first appearance in some fugitive publication — such as Leigh Hunt 's “ Literary Pocket-Book ” — and were subsequently incorporated in the collective editions . In every case the editio princeps and ( where this is possible ) the exact date of composition are indicated below the title .</note>

   <p>NOTE ON THE EARLY POEMS , BY MRS. SHELLEY .</p>
   <p>The remainder of Shelley 's Poems will be arranged in the order in which they were written . Of course , mistakes will occur in placing some of the shorter ones ; for , as I have said , many of these were thrown aside , and I never saw them till I had the misery of looking over his writings after the hand that traced them was dust ; and some were in the hands of others , and I never saw them till now . The subjects of the poems are often to me an unerring guide ; but on other occasions I can only guess , by finding them in the pages of the same manuscript book that contains poems with the date of whose composition I am fully conversant . In the present arrangement all his poetical translations will be placed together at the end .</p>
   <p>The loss of his early papers prevents my being able to give any of the poetry of his boyhood . Of the few I give as “ Early Poems ” , the greater part were published with “ Alastor ” ; some of them were written previously , some at the same period . The poem beginning ‘ Oh , there are spirits in the air ’ was addressed in idea to Coleridge , whom he never knew ; and at whose character he could only guess imperfectly , through his writings , and accounts he heard of him from some who knew him well . He regarded his change of opinions as rather an act of will than conviction , and believed that in his inner heart he would be haunted by what Shelley considered the better and holier aspirations of his youth . The summer evening that suggested to him the poem written in the churchyard of Lechlade occurred during his voyage up the Thames in 1815 . He had been advised by a physician to live as much as possible in the open air ; and a fortnight of a bright warm July was spent in tracing the Thames to its source . He never spent a season more tranquilly than the summer of 1815 . He had just recovered from a severe pulmonary attack ; the weather was warm and pleasant . He lived near Windsor Forest ; and his life was spent under its shades or on the water , meditating subjects for verse . Hitherto , he had chiefly aimed at extending his political doctrines , and attempted so to do by appeals in prose essays to the people , exhorting them to claim their rights ; but he had now begun to feel that the time for action was not ripe in England , and that the pen was the only instrument wherewith to prepare the way for better things .</p>
   <p>In the scanty journals kept during those years I find a record of the books that Shelley read during several years . During the years of 1814 and 1815 the list is extensive . It includes , in Greek , Homer , Hesiod , Theocritus , the histories of Thucydides and Herodotus , and Diogenes Laertius . In Latin , Petronius , Suetonius , some of the works of Cicero , a large proportion of those of Seneca and Livy . In English , Milton 's poems , Wordsworth 's “ Excursion ” , Southey 's “ Madoc ” and “ Thalaba ” , Locke “ On the Human Understanding ” , Bacon 's “ Novum Organum ” . In Italian , Ariosto , Tasso , and Alfieri . In French , the “ Reveries d'un Solitaire ” of Rousseau . To these may be added several modern books of travel . He read few novels .</p>

     <l n="12">First knew the unreserve of mingled being ,</l>
     <l n="13">He walked along the pathway of a field</l>
     <l n="14">Which to the east a hoar wood shadowed o'er , 10</l>

     <l n="16">There now the sun had sunk , but lines of gold</l>
     <l n="17">Hung on the ashen clouds , and on the points</l>
     <l n="18">Of the far level grass and nodding flowers</l>
     <l n="19">And the old dandelion 's hoary beard , 15</l>
     <l n="20">And , mingled with the shades of twilight , lay</l>
     <l n="21">On the brown massy woods — and in the east</l>
     <l n="22">The broad and burning moon lingeringly rose</l>
     <l n="23">Between the black trunks of the crowded trees ,</l>
     <l n="24">While the faint stars were gathering overhead .— 20</l>
     <l n="25">‘ Is it not strange , Isabel , ’ said the youth ,</l>
     <l n="26">‘ I never saw the sun ? We will walk here</l>
     <l n="27">To-morrow ; thou shalt look on it with me . ’</l>

     <l n="28">That night the youth and lady mingled lay</l>
     <l n="29">In love and sleep — but when the morning came 25</l>
     <l n="30">The lady found her lover dead and cold .</l>
     <l n="31">Let none believe that God in mercy gave</l>
     <l n="32">That stroke . The lady died not , nor grew wild ,</l>

     <l n="35">And that she did not die , but lived to tend</l>
     <l n="36">Her aged father , were a kind of madness ,</l>
     <l n="37">If madness ‘ tis to be unlike the world .</l>
     <l n="38">For but to see her were to read the tale</l>
     <l n="39">Woven by some subtlest bard , to make hard hearts 35</l>

     <l n="41">Her eyes were black and lustreless and wan :</l>
     <l n="42">Her eyelashes were worn away with tears ,</l>
     <l n="43">Her lips and cheeks were like things dead — so pale ;</l>
     <l n="44">Her hands were thin , and through their wandering veins 40</l>
     <l n="45">And weak articulations might be seen</l>
     <l n="46">Day 's ruddy light . The tomb of thy dead self</l>
     <l n="47">Which one vexed ghost inhabits , night and day ,</l>
     <l n="48">Is all , lost child , that now remains of thee !</l>

     <l n="39">My own , my human mind , which passively</l>

   <p>NOTE ON POEMS OF 1816 , BY MRS. SHELLEY .</p>
   <p>Shelley wrote little during this year . The poem entitled “ The Sunset ” was written in the spring of the year , while still residing at Bishopsgate . He spent the summer on the shores of the Lake of Geneva . The “ Hymn to Intellectual Beauty ” was conceived during his voyage round the lake with Lord Byron . He occupied himself during this voyage by reading the “ Nouvelle Heloise ” for the first time . The reading it on the very spot where the scenes are laid added to the interest ; and he was at once surprised and charmed by the passionate eloquence and earnest enthralling interest that pervade this work . There was something in the character of Saint-Preux , in his abnegation of self , and in the worship he paid to Love , that coincided with Shelley 's own disposition ; and , though differing in many of the views and shocked by others , yet the effect of the whole was fascinating and delightful .</p>
   <p>“ Mont Blanc ” was inspired by a view of that mountain and its surrounding peaks and valleys , as he lingered on the Bridge of Arve on his way through the Valley of Chamouni . Shelley makes the following mention of this poem in his publication of the “ History of a Six Weeks ’ Tour , and Letters from Switzerland ": ‘ The poem entitled “ Mont Blanc ” is written by the author of the two letters from Chamouni and Vevai . It was composed under the immediate impression of the deep and powerful feelings excited by the objects which it attempts to describe ; and , as an undisciplined overflowing of the soul , rests its claim to approbation on an attempt to imitate the untamable wildness and inaccessible solemnity from which those feelings sprang . ’</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">This was an eventful year , and less time was given to study than usual .</l>
     <l n="2">In the list of his reading I find , in Greek , Theocritus , the</l>
     <l n="3">“ Prometheus ” of Aeschylus , several of Plutarch 's “ Lives ” , and the works</l>
     <l n="4">of Lucian . In Latin , Lucretius , Pliny 's “ Letters ” , the “ Annals ” and</l>
     <l n="5">“ Germany ” of Tacitus . In French , the “ History of the French Revolution ”</l>
     <l n="6">by Lacretelle . He read for the first time , this year , Montaigne 's</l>
     <l n="7">“ Essays ” , and regarded them ever after as one of the most delightful</l>
     <l n="8">and instructive books in the world . The list is scanty in English</l>
     <l n="9">works : Locke 's “ Essay ” , “ Political Justice ” , and Coleridge 's “ Lay</l>
     <l n="10">Sermon ” , form nearly the whole . It was his frequent habit to read aloud</l>
     <l n="11">to me in the evening ; in this way we read , this year , the New</l>
     <l n="12">Testament , “ Paradise Lost ” , Spenser 's “ Faery Queen ” , and “ Don Quixote ” .</l>

     <l n="160">And through the chasm the flood did break</l>
     <l n="161">With an earth-uplifting cataract :</l>
     <l n="162">The statues gave a joyous scream ,</l>
     <l n="163">And on its wings the pale thin Dream</l>
     <l n="164">Lifted the Lady from the stream . 140</l>

     <l n="168">And she arose , while from the veil</l>
     <l n="169">Of her dark eyes the Dream did creep ,</l>
     <l n="170">And she walked about as one who knew 145</l>
     <l n="171">That sleep has sights as clear and true</l>
     <l n="172">As any waking eyes can view .</l>

    <head>TO CONSTANTIA , SINGING .</head>
    <note>Published by Mrs. Shelley in “ Posthumous Poems ” , 1824 . Amongst the Shelley manuscripts at the Bodleian is a chaotic first draft , from which Mr. Locock [ “ Examination ” , etc ., 1903 , pages 60-62 ] has , with patient ingenuity , disengaged a first and a second stanza consistent with the metrical scheme of stanzas 3 and 4 . The two stanzas thus recovered are printed here immediately below the poem as edited by Mrs. Shelley . It need hardly be added that Mr. Locock 's restored version cannot , any more than Mrs. Shelley 's obviously imperfect one , be regarded in the light of a final recension .</note>

   <p>NOTE ON POEMS OF 1817 , BY MRS. SHELLEY .</p>
   <p>The very illness that oppressed , and the aspect of death which had approached so near Shelley , appear to have kindled to yet keener life the Spirit of Poetry in his heart . The restless thoughts kept awake by pain clothed themselves in verse . Much was composed during this year . The “ Revolt of Islam ” , written and printed , was a great effort — “ Rosalind and Helen ” was begun — and the fragments and poems I can trace to the same period show how full of passion and reflection were his solitary hours .</p>
   <p>In addition to such poems as have an intelligible aim and shape , many a stray idea and transitory emotion found imperfect and abrupt expression , and then again lost themselves in silence . As he never wandered without a book and without implements of writing , I find many such , in his manuscript books , that scarcely bear record ; while some of them , broken and vague as they are , will appear valuable to those who love Shelley 's mind , and desire to trace its workings .</p>
   <p>He projected also translating the “ Hymns ” of Homer ; his version of several of the shorter ones remains , as well as that to Mercury already published in the “ Posthumous Poems ” . His readings this year were chiefly Greek . Besides the “ Hymns ” of Homer and the “ Iliad ” , he read the dramas of Aeschylus and Sophocles , the “ Symposium ” of Plato , and Arrian 's “ Historia Indica ” . In Latin , Apuleius alone is named . In English , the Bible was his constant study ; he read a great portion of it aloud in the evening . Among these evening readings I find also mentioned the “ Faerie Queen ” ; and other modern works , the production of his contemporaries , Coleridge , Wordsworth , Moore and Byron .</p>
   <p>His life was now spent more in thought than action — he had lost the eager spirit which believed it could achieve what it projected for the benefit of mankind . And yet in the converse of daily life Shelley was far from being a melancholy man . He was eloquent when philosophy or politics or taste were the subjects of conversation . He was playful ; and indulged in the wild spirit that mocked itself and others — not in bitterness , but in sport . The author of “ Nightmare Abbey ” seized on some points of his character and some habits of his life when he painted Scythrop . He was not addicted to ‘ port or madeira , ’ but in youth he had read of ‘ Illuminati and Eleutherarchs , ’ and believed that he possessed the power of operating an immediate change in the minds of men and the state of society . These wild dreams had faded ; sorrow and adversity had struck home ; but he struggled with despondency as he did with physical pain . There are few who remember him sailing paper boats , and watching the navigation of his tiny craft with eagerness — or repeating with wild energy “ The Ancient Mariner ” , and Southey 's “ Old Woman of Berkeley ” ; but those who do will recollect that it was in such , and in the creations of his own fancy when that was most daring and ideal , that he sheltered himself from the storms and disappointments , the pain and sorrow , that beset his life .</p>
   <p>No words can express the anguish he felt when his elder children were torn from him . In his first resentment against the Chancellor , on the passing of the decree , he had written a curse , in which there breathes , besides haughty indignation , all the tenderness of a father 's love , which could imagine and fondly dwell upon its loss and the consequences .</p>
   <p>At one time , while the question was still pending , the Chancellor had said some words that seemed to intimate that Shelley should not be permitted the care of any of his children , and for a moment he feared that our infant son would be torn from us . He did not hesitate to resolve , if such were menaced , to abandon country , fortune , everything , and to escape with his child ; and I find some unfinished stanzas addressed to this son , whom afterwards we lost at Rome , written under the idea that we might suddenly be forced to cross the sea , so to preserve him . This poem , as well as the one previously quoted , were not written to exhibit the pangs of distress to the public ; they were the spontaneous outbursts of a man who brooded over his wrongs and woes , and was impelled to shed the grace of his genius over the uncontrollable emotions of his heart . I ought to observe that the fourth verse of this effusion is introduced in “ Rosalind and Helen ” . When afterwards this child died at Rome , he wrote , a propos of the English burying-ground in that city : ‘ This spot is the repository of a sacred loss , of which the yearnings of a parent 's heart are now prophetic ; he is rendered immortal by love , as his memory is by death . My beloved child lies buried here . I envy death the body far less than the oppressors the minds of those whom they have torn from me . The one can only kill the body , the other crushes the affections . ’</p>

   <p>MADDALO , A COURTIER . MALPIGLIO , A POET . PIGNA , A MINISTER . ALBANO , AN USHER .</p>
   <p>MADDALO : No access to the Duke ! You have not said That the Count Maddalo would speak with him ?</p>
   <p>PIGNA : Did you inform his Grace that Signor Pigna Waits with state papers for his signature ?</p>
   <p>MALPIGLIO : The Lady Leonora cannot know 5 That I have written a sonnet to her fame , In which I ... Venus and Adonis . You should not take my gold and serve me not .</p>
   <p>ALBANO : In truth I told her , and she smiled and said , ‘ If I am Venus , thou , coy Poesy , 10 Art the Adonis whom I love , and he The Erymanthian boar that wounded him . ’ O trust to me , Signor Malpiglio , Those nods and smiles were favours worth the zechin .</p>
   <p>MALPIGLIO : The words are twisted in some double sense 15 That I reach not : the smiles fell not on me .</p>
   <p>PIGNA : How are the Duke and Duchess occupied ?</p>
   <p>ALBANO : Buried in some strange talk . The Duke was leaning , His finger on his brow , his lips unclosed . The Princess sate within the window-seat , 20 And so her face was hid ; but on her knee Her hands were clasped , veined , and pale as snow , And quivering — young Tasso , too , was there .</p>
   <p>MADDALO : Thou seest on whom from thine own worshipped heaven Thou drawest down smiles — they did not rain on thee . 25</p>
   <p>MALPIGLIO : Would they were parching lightnings for his sake On whom they fell !</p>

   <p>MARENGHI . ( This fragment refers to an event told in Sismondi 's “ Histoire des Republiques Italiennes ” , which occurred during the war when Florence finally subdued Pisa , and reduced it to a province .— [ MRS. SHELLEY 'S NOTE , 1824 . ])</p>
   <note>Published in part ( stanzas 7-15 . ) by Mrs. Shelley , “ Posthumous Poems ” , 1824 ; stanzas 1-28 by W. M . Rossetti , “ Complete Poetical Works of P. B. S . ” , 1870 . The Boscombe manuscript — evidently a first draft — from which ( through Dr. Garnett ) Rossetti derived the text of 1870 is now at the Bodleian , and has recently been collated by Mr. C. D . Locock , to whom the enlarged and amended text here printed is owing . The substitution , in title and text , of “ Marenghi ” for “ Mazenghi ” ( 1824 ) is due to Rossetti . Here as elsewhere in the footnotes B . = the Bodleian manuscript .</note>

   <p>NOTE ON POEMS OF 1818 , BY MRS. SHELLEY .</p>
   <p>We often hear of persons disappointed by a first visit to Italy . This was not Shelley 's case . The aspect of its nature , its sunny sky , its majestic storms , of the luxuriant vegetation of the country , and the noble marble-built cities , enchanted him . The sight of the works of art was full enjoyment and wonder . He had not studied pictures or statues before ; he now did so with the eye of taste , that referred not to the rules of schools , but to those of Nature and truth . The first entrance to Rome opened to him a scene of remains of antique grandeur that far surpassed his expectations ; and the unspeakable beauty of Naples and its environs added to the impression he received of the transcendent and glorious beauty of Italy .</p>
   <p>Our winter was spent at Naples . Here he wrote the fragments of “ Marenghi ” and “ The Woodman and the Nightingale ” , which he afterwards threw aside . At this time , Shelley suffered greatly in health . He put himself under the care of a medical man , who promised great things , and made him endure severe bodily pain , without any good results . Constant and poignant physical suffering exhausted him ; and though he preserved the appearance of cheerfulness , and often greatly enjoyed our wanderings in the environs of Naples , and our excursions on its sunny sea , yet many hours were passed when his thoughts , shadowed by illness , became gloomy ,— and then he escaped to solitude , and in verses , which he hid from fear of wounding me , poured forth morbid but too natural bursts of discontent and sadness . One looks back with unspeakable regret and gnawing remorse to such periods ; fancying that , had one been more alive to the nature of his feelings , and more attentive to soothe them , such would not have existed . And yet , enjoying as he appeared to do every sight or influence of earth or sky , it was difficult to imagine that any melancholy he showed was aught but the effect of the constant pain to which he was a martyr .</p>
   <p>We lived in utter solitude . And such is often not the nurse of cheerfulness ; for then , at least with those who have been exposed to adversity , the mind broods over its sorrows too intently ; while the society of the enlightened , the witty , and the wise , enables us to forget ourselves by making us the sharers of the thoughts of others , which is a portion of the philosophy of happiness . Shelley never liked society in numbers ,— it harassed and wearied him ; but neither did he like loneliness , and usually , when alone , sheltered himself against memory and reflection in a book . But , with one or two whom he loved , he gave way to wild and joyous spirits , or in more serious conversation expounded his opinions with vivacity and eloquence . If an argument arose , no man ever argued better . He was clear , logical , and earnest , in supporting his own views ; attentive , patient , and impartial , while listening to those on the adverse side . Had not a wall of prejudice been raised at this time between him and his countrymen , how many would have sought the acquaintance of one whom to know was to love and to revere ! How many of the more enlightened of his contemporaries have since regretted that they did not seek him ! how very few knew his worth while he lived ! and , of those few , several were withheld by timidity or envy from declaring their sense of it . But no man was ever more enthusiastically loved — more looked up to , as one superior to his fellows in intellectual endowments and moral worth , by the few who knew him well , and had sufficient nobleness of soul to appreciate his superiority . His excellence is now acknowledged ; but , even while admitted , not duly appreciated . For who , except those who were acquainted with him , can imagine his unwearied benevolence , his generosity , his systematic forbearance ? And still less is his vast superiority in intellectual attainments sufficiently understood — his sagacity , his clear understanding , his learning , his prodigious memory . All these as displayed in conversation , were known to few while he lived , and are now silent in the tomb :</p>

   <p>ODE TO THE WEST WIND .</p>
   <p>( This poem was conceived and chiefly written in a wood that skirts the Arno , near Florence , and on a day when that tempestuous wind , whose temperature is at once mild and animating , was collecting the vapours which pour down the autumnal rains . They began , as I foresaw , at sunset with a violent tempest of hail and rain , attended by that magnificent thunder and lightning peculiar to the Cisalpine regions .</p>
   <p>The phenomenon alluded to at the conclusion of the third stanza is well known to naturalists . The vegetation at the bottom of the sea , of rivers , and of lakes , sympathizes with that of the land in the change of seasons , and is consequently influenced by the winds which announce it .— [ SHELLEY 'S NOTE . ])</p>

   <p>NOTE ON POEMS OF 1819 , BY MRS. SHELLEY .</p>
   <p>Shelley loved the People ; and respected them as often more virtuous , as always more suffering , and therefore more deserving of sympathy , than the great . He believed that a clash between the two classes of society was inevitable , and he eagerly ranged himself on the people 's side . He had an idea of publishing a series of poems adapted expressly to commemorate their circumstances and wrongs . He wrote a few ; but , in those days of prosecution for libel , they could not be printed . They are not among the best of his productions , a writer being always shackled when he endeavours to write down to the comprehension of those who could not understand or feel a highly imaginative style ; but they show his earnestness , and with what heart-felt compassion he went home to the direct point of injury — that oppression is detestable as being the parent of starvation , nakedness , and ignorance . Besides these outpourings of compassion and indignation , he had meant to adorn the cause he loved with loftier poetry of glory and triumph : such is the scope of the “ Ode to the Assertors of Liberty ” . He sketched also a new version of our national anthem , as addressed to Liberty .</p>

     <l n="14">Of the wind-cloven wave to the chasm of the deep</l>
     <l n="15">It sinks , and the walls of the watery vale 15</l>

     <l n="17">Dim mirrors of ruin , hang gleaming about ;</l>
     <l n="18">While the surf , like a chaos of stars , like a rout</l>
     <l n="19">Of death-flames , like whirlpools of fire-flowing iron ,</l>
     <l n="20">With splendour and terror the black ship environ , 20</l>
     <l n="21">Or like sulphur-flakes hurled from a mine of pale fire</l>
     <l n="22">In fountains spout o'er it . In many a spire</l>
     <l n="23">The pyramid-billows with white points of brine</l>
     <l n="24">In the cope of the lightning inconstantly shine ,</l>
     <l n="25">As piercing the sky from the floor of the sea . 25</l>
     <l n="26">The great ship seems splitting ! it cracks as a tree ,</l>
     <l n="27">While an earthquake is splintering its root , ere the blast</l>
     <l n="28">Of the whirlwind that stripped it of branches has passed .</l>
     <l n="29">The intense thunder-balls which are raining from Heaven</l>
     <l n="30">Have shattered its mast , and it stands black and riven . 30</l>
     <l n="31">The chinks suck destruction . The heavy dead hulk</l>
     <l n="32">On the living sea rolls an inanimate bulk ,</l>
     <l n="33">Like a corpse on the clay which is hungering to fold</l>
     <l n="34">Its corruption around it . Meanwhile , from the hold ,</l>
     <l n="35">One deck is burst up by the waters below , 35</l>
     <l n="36">And it splits like the ice when the thaw-breezes blow</l>
     <l n="37">O'er the lakes of the desert ! Who sit on the other ?</l>
     <l n="38">Is that all the crew that lie burying each other ,</l>
     <l n="39">Like the dead in a breach , round the foremast ? Are those</l>
     <l n="40">Twin tigers , who burst , when the waters arose , 40</l>
     <l n="41">In the agony of terror , their chains in the hold ;</l>
     <l n="42">( What now makes them tame , is what then made them bold ;)</l>
     <l n="43">Who crouch , side by side , and have driven , like a crank ,</l>
     <l n="44">The deep grip of their claws through the vibrating plank</l>
     <l n="45">Are these all ? Nine weeks the tall vessel had lain 45</l>
     <l n="46">On the windless expanse of the watery plain ,</l>
     <l n="47">Where the death-darting sun cast no shadow at noon ,</l>
     <l n="48">And there seemed to be fire in the beams of the moon ,</l>
     <l n="49">Till a lead-coloured fog gathered up from the deep ,</l>
     <l n="50">Whose breath was quick pestilence ; then , the cold sleep 50</l>
     <l n="51">Crept , like blight through the ears of a thick field of corn ,</l>
     <l n="52">O'er the populous vessel . And even and morn ,</l>
     <l n="53">With their hammocks for coffins the seamen aghast</l>
     <l n="54">Like dead men the dead limbs of their comrades cast</l>
     <l n="55">Down the deep , which closed on them above and around , 55</l>
     <l n="56">And the sharks and the dogfish their grave-clothes unbound ,</l>
     <l n="57">And were glutted like Jews with this manna rained down</l>
     <l n="58">From God on their wilderness . One after one</l>
     <l n="59">The mariners died ; on the eve of this day ,</l>
     <l n="60">When the tempest was gathering in cloudy array , 60</l>
     <l n="61">But seven remained . Six the thunder has smitten ,</l>
     <l n="62">And they lie black as mummies on which Time has written</l>
     <l n="63">His scorn of the embalmer ; the seventh , from the deck</l>
     <l n="64">An oak-splinter pierced through his breast and his back ,</l>
     <l n="65">And hung out to the tempest , a wreck on the wreck . 65</l>
     <l n="66">No more ? At the helm sits a woman more fair</l>
     <l n="67">Than Heaven , when , unbinding its star-braided hair ,</l>
     <l n="68">It sinks with the sun on the earth and the sea .</l>
     <l n="69">She clasps a bright child on her upgathered knee ;</l>
     <l n="70">It laughs at the lightning , it mocks the mixed thunder 70</l>
     <l n="71">Of the air and the sea , with desire and with wonder</l>
     <l n="72">It is beckoning the tigers to rise and come near ,</l>
     <l n="73">It would play with those eyes where the radiance of fear</l>
     <l n="74">Is outshining the meteors ; its bosom beats high ,</l>
     <l n="75">The heart-fire of pleasure has kindled its eye , 75</l>
     <l n="76">While its mother 's is lustreless . ‘ Smile not , my child ,</l>
     <l n="77">But sleep deeply and sweetly , and so be beguiled</l>
     <l n="78">Of the pang that awaits us , whatever that be ,</l>
     <l n="79">So dreadful since thou must divide it with me !</l>
     <l n="80">Dream , sleep ! This pale bosom , thy cradle and bed , 80</l>
     <l n="81">Will it rock thee not , infant ? ‘ Tis beating with dread !</l>
     <l n="82">Alas ! what is life , what is death , what are we ,</l>
     <l n="83">That when the ship sinks we no longer may be ?</l>
     <l n="84">What ! to see thee no more , and to feel thee no more ?</l>
     <l n="85">To be after life what we have been before ? 85</l>
     <l n="86">Not to touch those sweet hands ? Not to look on those eyes ,</l>
     <l n="87">Those lips , and that hair ,— all the smiling disguise</l>
     <l n="88">Thou yet wearest , sweet Spirit , which I , day by day ,</l>
     <l n="89">Have so long called my child , but which now fades away</l>
     <l n="90">Like a rainbow , and I the fallen shower ? ’ — Lo ! the ship 90</l>
     <l n="91">Is settling , it topples , the leeward ports dip ;</l>
     <l n="92">The tigers leap up when they feel the slow brine</l>
     <l n="93">Crawling inch by inch on them ; hair , ears , limbs , and eyne ,</l>
     <l n="94">Stand rigid with horror ; a loud , long , hoarse cry</l>
     <l n="95">Bursts at once from their vitals tremendously , 95</l>
     <l n="96">And ‘ tis borne down the mountainous vale of the wave ,</l>
     <l n="97">Rebounding , like thunder , from crag to cave ,</l>
     <l n="98">Mixed with the clash of the lashing rain ,</l>
     <l n="99">Hurried on by the might of the hurricane :</l>
     <l n="100">The hurricane came from the west , and passed on 100</l>
     <l n="101">By the path of the gate of the eastern sun ,</l>
     <l n="102">Transversely dividing the stream of the storm ;</l>
     <l n="103">As an arrowy serpent , pursuing the form</l>
     <l n="104">Of an elephant , bursts through the brakes of the waste .</l>
     <l n="105">Black as a cormorant the screaming blast , 105</l>
     <l n="106">Between Ocean and Heaven , like an ocean , passed ,</l>
     <l n="107">Till it came to the clouds on the verge of the world</l>
     <l n="108">Which , based on the sea and to Heaven upcurled ,</l>
     <l n="109">Like columns and walls did surround and sustain</l>
     <l n="110">The dome of the tempest ; it rent them in twain , 110</l>
     <l n="111">As a flood rends its barriers of mountainous crag :</l>
     <l n="112">And the dense clouds in many a ruin and rag ,</l>
     <l n="113">Like the stones of a temple ere earthquake has passed ,</l>
     <l n="114">Like the dust of its fall . on the whirlwind are cast ;</l>
     <l n="115">They are scattered like foam on the torrent ; and where 115</l>
     <l n="116">The wind has burst out through the chasm , from the air</l>
     <l n="117">Of clear morning the beams of the sunrise flow in ,</l>
     <l n="118">Unimpeded , keen , golden , and crystalline ,</l>
     <l n="119">Banded armies of light and of air ; at one gate</l>
     <l n="120">They encounter , but interpenetrate . 120</l>
     <l n="121">And that breach in the tempest is widening away ,</l>
     <l n="122">And the caverns of cloud are torn up by the day ,</l>
     <l n="123">And the fierce winds are sinking with weary wings ,</l>
     <l n="124">Lulled by the motion and murmurings</l>
     <l n="125">And the long glassy heave of the rocking sea , 125</l>
     <l n="126">And overhead glorious , but dreadful to see ,</l>
     <l n="127">The wrecks of the tempest , like vapours of gold ,</l>
     <l n="128">Are consuming in sunrise . The heaped waves behold</l>
     <l n="129">The deep calm of blue Heaven dilating above ,</l>
     <l n="130">And , like passions made still by the presence of Love , 130</l>
     <l n="131">Beneath the clear surface reflecting it slide</l>
     <l n="132">Tremulous with soft influence ; extending its tide</l>
     <l n="133">From the Andes to Atlas , round mountain and isle ,</l>
     <l n="134">Round sea-birds and wrecks , paved with Heaven 's azure smile ,</l>
     <l n="135">The wide world of waters is vibrating . Where 135</l>
     <l n="136">Is the ship ? On the verge of the wave where it lay</l>
     <l n="137">One tiger is mingled in ghastly affray</l>
     <l n="138">With a sea-snake . The foam and the smoke of the battle</l>
     <l n="139">Stain the clear air with sunbows ; the jar , and the rattle</l>
     <l n="140">Of solid bones crushed by the infinite stress 140</l>
     <l n="141">Of the snake 's adamantine voluminousness ;</l>
     <l n="142">And the hum of the hot blood that spouts and rains</l>
     <l n="143">Where the gripe of the tiger has wounded the veins</l>
     <l n="144">Swollen with rage , strength , and effort ; the whirl and the splash</l>
     <l n="145">As of some hideous engine whose brazen teeth smash 145</l>
     <l n="146">The thin winds and soft waves into thunder ; the screams</l>
     <l n="147">And hissings crawl fast o'er the smooth ocean-streams ,</l>
     <l n="148">Each sound like a centipede . Near this commotion ,</l>
     <l n="149">A blue shark is hanging within the blue ocean ,</l>
     <l n="150">The fin-winged tomb of the victor . The other 150</l>
     <l n="151">Is winning his way from the fate of his brother</l>
     <l n="152">To his own with the speed of despair . Lo ! a boat</l>
     <l n="153">Advances ; twelve rowers with the impulse of thought</l>
     <l n="154">Urge on the keen keel ,— the brine foams . At the stern</l>
     <l n="155">Three marksmen stand levelling . Hot bullets burn 155</l>
     <l n="156">In the breast of the tiger , which yet bears him on</l>
     <l n="157">To his refuge and ruin . One fragment alone ,—</l>
     <l n="158">‘ Tis dwindling and sinking , ‘ tis now almost gone ,—</l>
     <l n="159">Of the wreck of the vessel peers out of the sea .</l>
     <l n="160">With her left hand she grasps it impetuously . 160</l>
     <l n="161">With her right she sustains her fair infant . Death , Fear ,</l>
     <l n="162">Love , Beauty , are mixed in the atmosphere ,</l>
     <l n="163">Which trembles and burns with the fervour of dread</l>
     <l n="164">Around her wild eyes , her bright hand , and her head ,</l>
     <l n="165">Like a meteor of light o'er the waters ! her child 165</l>
     <l n="166">Is yet smiling , and playing , and murmuring ; so smiled</l>
     <l n="167">The false deep ere the storm . Like a sister and brother</l>
     <l n="168">The child and the ocean still smile on each other ,</l>
     <l n="169">Whilst —</l>

    <head>THE TWO SPIRITS : AN ALLEGORY .</head>

   </lg>
   <p>FIRST SPIRIT : O thou , who plumed with strong desire Wouldst float above the earth , beware ! A Shadow tracks thy flight of fire — Night is coming ! Bright are the regions of the air , 5 And among the winds and beams It were delight to wander there — Night is coming !</p>
   <p>SECOND SPIRIT : The deathless stars are bright above ; If I would cross the shade of night , 10 Within my heart is the lamp of love , And that is day ! And the moon will smile with gentle light On my golden plumes where'er they move ; The meteors will linger round my flight , 15 And make night day .</p>
   <p>FIRST SPIRIT : But if the whirlwinds of darkness waken Hail , and lightning , and stormy rain ; See , the bounds of the air are shaken — Night is coming ! 20 The red swift clouds of the hurricane Yon declining sun have overtaken , The clash of the hail sweeps over the plain — Night is coming !</p>
   <p>SECOND SPIRIT : I see the light , and I hear the sound ; 25 I 'll sail on the flood of the tempest dark With the calm within and the light around Which makes night day : And thou , when the gloom is deep and stark , Look from thy dull earth , slumber-bound , 30 My moon-like flight thou then mayst mark On high , far away .</p>

   <p>ODE TO NAPLES .</p>
   <p>( The Author has connected many recollections of his visit to Pompeii and Baiae with the enthusiasm excited by the intelligence of the proclamation of a Constitutional Government at Naples . This has given a tinge of picturesque and descriptive imagery to the introductory Epodes which depicture these scenes , and some of the majestic feelings permanently connected with the scene of this animating event .— [ SHELLEY 'S NOTE . ])</p>
   <note>Composed at San Juliano di Pisa , August 17-25 , 1820 ; published in “ Posthumous Poems ” , 1824 . There is a copy , ‘ for the most part neat and legible , ’ amongst the Shelley manuscripts at the Bodleian Library . See Mr. C. D . Locock 's “ Examination ” , etc ., 1903 , pages 14-18 .</note>

   <p>A : Not far from hence . From yonder pointed hill , Crowned with a ring of oaks , you may behold A dark and barren field , through which there flows , Sluggish and black , a deep but narrow stream , Which the wind ripples not , and the fair moon 5 Gazes in vain , and finds no mirror there . Follow the herbless banks of that strange brook Until you pause beside a darksome pond , The fountain of this rivulet , whose gush Cannot be seen , hid by a rayless night 10 That lives beneath the overhanging rock That shades the pool — an endless spring of gloom , Upon whose edge hovers the tender light , Trembling to mingle with its paramour ,— But , as Syrinx fled Pan , so night flies day , 15 Or , with most sullen and regardless hate , Refuses stern her heaven-born embrace . On one side of this jagged and shapeless hill There is a cave , from which there eddies up A pale mist , like aereal gossamer , 20 Whose breath destroys all life — awhile it veils The rock — then , scattered by the wind , it flies Along the stream , or lingers on the clefts , Killing the sleepy worms , if aught bide there . Upon the beetling edge of that dark rock 25 There stands a group of cypresses ; not such As , with a graceful spire and stirring life , Pierce the pure heaven of your native vale , Whose branches the air plays among , but not Disturbs , fearing to spoil their solemn grace ; 30 But blasted and all wearily they stand , One to another clinging ; their weak boughs Sigh as the wind buffets them , and they shake Beneath its blasts — a weatherbeaten crew !</p>
   <p>CHORUS : What wondrous sound is that , mournful and faint , 35 But more melodious than the murmuring wind Which through the columns of a temple glides ?</p>
   <p>A : It is the wandering voice of Orpheus ’ lyre , Borne by the winds , who sigh that their rude king Hurries them fast from these air-feeding notes ; 40 But in their speed they bear along with them The waning sound , scattering it like dew Upon the startled sense .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Does he still sing ? Methought he rashly cast away his harp When he had lost Eurydice .</p>
   <p>A : Ah , no ! 45 Awhile he paused . As a poor hunted stag A moment shudders on the fearful brink Of a swift stream — the cruel hounds press on With deafening yell , the arrows glance and wound ,— He plunges in : so Orpheus , seized and torn 50 By the sharp fangs of an insatiate grief , Maenad-like waved his lyre in the bright air , And wildly shrieked ‘ Where she is , it is dark ! ’ And then he struck from forth the strings a sound Of deep and fearful melody . Alas ! 55 In times long past , when fair Eurydice With her bright eyes sat listening by his side , He gently sang of high and heavenly themes . As in a brook , fretted with little waves By the light airs of spring — each riplet makes 60 A many-sided mirror for the sun , While it flows musically through green banks , Ceaseless and pauseless , ever clear and fresh , So flowed his song , reflecting the deep joy And tender love that fed those sweetest notes , 65 The heavenly offspring of ambrosial food . But that is past . Returning from drear Hell , He chose a lonely seat of unhewn stone , Blackened with lichens , on a herbless plain . Then from the deep and overflowing spring 70 Of his eternal ever-moving grief There rose to Heaven a sound of angry song . ‘ Tis as a mighty cataract that parts Two sister rocks with waters swift and strong , 75 And casts itself with horrid roar and din Adown a steep ; from a perennial source It ever flows and falls , and breaks the air With loud and fierce , but most harmonious roar , And as it falls casts up a vaporous spray Which the sun clothes in hues of Iris light . 80 Thus the tempestuous torrent of his grief Is clothed in sweetest sounds and varying words Of poesy . Unlike all human works , It never slackens , and through every change Wisdom and beauty and the power divine 85 Of mighty poesy together dwell , Mingling in sweet accord . As I have seen A fierce south blast tear through the darkened sky , Driving along a rack of winged clouds , Which may not pause , but ever hurry on , 90 As their wild shepherd wills them , while the stars , Twinkling and dim , peep from between the plumes . Anon the sky is cleared , and the high dome Of serene Heaven , starred with fiery flowers , Shuts in the shaken earth ; or the still moon 95 Swiftly , yet gracefully , begins her walk , Rising all bright behind the eastern hills . I talk of moon , and wind , and stars , and not Of song ; but , would I echo his high song , Nature must lend me words ne'er used before , 100 Or I must borrow from her perfect works , To picture forth his perfect attributes . He does no longer sit upon his throne Of rock upon a desert herbless plain , For the evergreen and knotted ilexes , 105 And cypresses that seldom wave their boughs , And sea-green olives with their grateful fruit , And elms dragging along the twisted vines , Which drop their berries as they follow fast , And blackthorn bushes with their infant race 110 Of blushing rose-blooms ; beeches , to lovers dear , And weeping willow trees ; all swift or slow , As their huge boughs or lighter dress permit , Have circled in his throne , and Earth herself Has sent from her maternal breast a growth 115 Of starlike flowers and herbs of odour sweet , To pave the temple that his poesy Has framed , while near his feet grim lions couch , And kids , fearless from love , creep near his lair . Even the blind worms seem to feel the sound . 120 The birds are silent , hanging down their heads , Perched on the lowest branches of the trees ; Not even the nightingale intrudes a note In rivalry , but all entranced she listens .</p>

   <p>NOTE ON POEMS OF 1820 , BY MRS. SHELLEY .</p>
   <p>We spent the latter part of the year 1819 in Florence , where Shelley passed several hours daily in the Gallery , and made various notes on its ancient works of art . His thoughts were a good deal taken up also by the project of a steamboat , undertaken by a friend , an engineer , to ply between Leghorn and Marseilles , for which he supplied a sum of money . This was a sort of plan to delight Shelley , and he was greatly disappointed when it was thrown aside .</p>
   <p>There was something in Florence that disagreed excessively with his health , and he suffered far more pain than usual ; so much so that we left it sooner than we intended , and removed to Pisa , where we had some friends , and , above all , where we could consult the celebrated Vacca as to the cause of Shelley 's sufferings . He , like every other medical man , could only guess at that , and gave little hope of immediate relief ; he enjoined him to abstain from all physicians and medicine , and to leave his complaint to Nature . As he had vainly consulted medical men of the highest repute in England , he was easily persuaded to adopt this advice . Pain and ill-health followed him to the end ; but the residence at Pisa agreed with him better than any other , and there in consequence we remained .</p>
   <p>In the Spring we spent a week or two near Leghorn , borrowing the house of some friends who were absent on a journey to England . It was on a beautiful summer evening , while wandering among the lanes whose myrtle-hedges were the bowers of the fire-flies , that we heard the carolling of the skylark which inspired one of the most beautiful of his poems . He addressed the letter to Mrs. Gisborne from this house , which was hers : he had made his study of the workshop of her son , who was an engineer . Mrs. Gisborne had been a friend of my father in her younger days . She was a lady of great accomplishments , and charming from her frank and affectionate nature . She had the most intense love of knowledge , a delicate and trembling sensibility , and preserved freshness of mind after a life of considerable adversity . As a favourite friend of my father , we had sought her with eagerness ; and the most open and cordial friendship was established between us .</p>
   <p>Our stay at the Baths of San Giuliano was shortened by an accident . At the foot of our garden ran the canal that communicated between the Serchio and the Arno . The Serchio overflowed its banks , and , breaking its bounds , this canal also overflowed ; all this part of the country is below the level of its rivers , and the consequence was that it was speedily flooded . The rising waters filled the Square of the Baths , in the lower part of which our house was situated . The canal overflowed in the garden behind ; the rising waters on either side at last burst open the doors , and , meeting in the house , rose to the height of six feet . It was a picturesque sight at night to see the peasants driving the cattle from the plains below to the hills above the Baths . A fire was kept up to guide them across the ford ; and the forms of the men and the animals showed in dark relief against the red glare of the flame , which was reflected again in the waters that filled the Square .</p>
   <p>We then removed to Pisa , and took up our abode there for the winter . The extreme mildness of the climate suited Shelley , and his solitude was enlivened by an intercourse with several intimate friends . Chance cast us strangely enough on this quiet half-unpeopled town ; but its very peace suited Shelley . Its river , the near mountains , and not distant sea , added to its attractions , and were the objects of many delightful excursions . We feared the south of Italy , and a hotter climate , on account of our child ; our former bereavement inspiring us with terror . We seemed to take root here , and moved little afterwards ; often , indeed , entertaining projects for visiting other parts of Italy , but still delaying . But for our fears on account of our child , I believe we should have wandered over the world , both being passionately fond of travelling . But human life , besides its great unalterable necessities , is ruled by a thousand lilliputian ties that shackle at the time , although it is difficult to account afterwards for their influence over our destiny .</p>

     <l n="3">His name , they said , was Pleasure ,</l>
     <l n="4">And near him stood , glorious beyond measure</l>
     <l n="5">Four Ladies who possess all empery</l>
     <l n="6">In earth and air and sea , 5</l>
     <l n="7">Nothing that lives from their award is free .</l>
     <l n="8">Their names will I declare to thee ,</l>
     <l n="9">Love , Hope , Desire , and Fear ,</l>
     <l n="10">And they the regents are</l>
     <l n="11">Of the four elements that frame the heart , 10</l>
     <l n="12">And each diversely exercised her art</l>
     <l n="13">By force or circumstance or sleight</l>
     <l n="14">To prove her dreadful might</l>
     <l n="15">Upon that poor domain .</l>

     <l n="17">The spirit dwelling there</l>
     <l n="18">Was spellbound to embrace what seemed so fair</l>
     <l n="19">Within that magic mirror ,</l>
     <l n="20">And dazed by that bright error ,</l>
     <l n="21">It would have scorned the [ shafts ] of the avenger 20</l>
     <l n="22">And death , and penitence , and danger ,</l>
     <l n="23">Had not then silent Fear</l>
     <l n="24">Touched with her palsying spear ,</l>
     <l n="25">So that as if a frozen torrent</l>
     <l n="26">The blood was curdled in its current ; 25</l>
     <l n="27">It dared not speak , even in look or motion ,</l>
     <l n="28">But chained within itself its proud devotion .</l>
     <l n="29">Between Desire and Fear thou wert</l>
     <l n="30">A wretched thing , poor heart !</l>
     <l n="31">Sad was his life who bore thee in his breast , 30</l>
     <l n="32">Wild bird for that weak nest .</l>
     <l n="33">Till Love even from fierce Desire it bought ,</l>
     <l n="34">And from the very wound of tender thought</l>
     <l n="35">Drew solace , and the pity of sweet eyes</l>
     <l n="36">Gave strength to bear those gentle agonies , 35</l>
     <l n="37">Surmount the loss , the terror , and the sorrow .</l>
     <l n="38">Then Hope approached , she who can borrow</l>
     <l n="39">For poor to-day , from rich tomorrow ,</l>
     <l n="40">And Fear withdrew , as night when day</l>
     <l n="41">Descends upon the orient ray , 40</l>
     <l n="42">And after long and vain endurance</l>
     <l n="43">The poor heart woke to her assurance .</l>
     <l n="44">— At one birth these four were born</l>
     <l n="45">With the world 's forgotten morn ,</l>
     <l n="46">And from Pleasure still they hold 45</l>
     <l n="47">All it circles , as of old .</l>
     <l n="48">When , as summer lures the swallow ,</l>
     <l n="49">Pleasure lures the heart to follow —</l>
     <l n="50">O weak heart of little wit !</l>
     <l n="51">The fair hand that wounded it , 50</l>
     <l n="52">Seeking , like a panting hare ,</l>
     <l n="53">Refuge in the lynx 's lair ,</l>
     <l n="54">Love , Desire , Hope , and Fear ,</l>
     <l n="55">Ever will be near .</l>

     <l n="86">Had made her accents weaker and more weak ,</l>
     <l n="87">And quenched the crimson life upon her cheek , 85</l>
     <l n="88">And glazed her eyes , and spread an atmosphere</l>
     <l n="89">Round her , which chilled the burning noon with fear ,</l>
     <l n="90">Making her but an image of the thought</l>
     <l n="91">Which , like a prophet or a shadow , brought</l>
     <l n="92">News of the terrors of the coming time . 90</l>
     <l n="93">Like an accuser branded with the crime</l>
     <l n="94">He would have cast on a beloved friend ,</l>
     <l n="95">Whose dying eyes reproach not to the end</l>
     <l n="96">The pale betrayer — he then with vain repentance</l>
     <l n="97">Would share , he cannot now avert , the sentence — 95</l>
     <l n="98">Antonio stood and would have spoken , when</l>
     <l n="99">The compound voice of women and of men</l>
     <l n="100">Was heard approaching ; he retired , while she</l>
     <l n="101">Was led amid the admiring company</l>
     <l n="102">Back to the palace ,— and her maidens soon 100</l>
     <l n="103">Changed her attire for the afternoon ,</l>
     <l n="104">And left her at her own request to keep</l>
     <l n="105">An hour of quiet rest :— like one asleep</l>
     <l n="106">With open eyes and folded hands she lay ,</l>
     <l n="107">Pale in the light of the declining day . 105</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="108">Meanwhile the day sinks fast , the sun is set ,</l>
     <l n="109">And in the lighted hall the guests are met ;</l>

     <l n="111">Of love , and admiration , and delight</l>
     <l n="112">Reflected from a thousand hearts and eyes , 110</l>
     <l n="113">Kindling a momentary Paradise .</l>
     <l n="114">This crowd is safer than the silent wood ,</l>
     <l n="115">Where love 's own doubts disturb the solitude ;</l>
     <l n="116">On frozen hearts the fiery rain of wine</l>
     <l n="117">Falls , and the dew of music more divine 115</l>
     <l n="118">Tempers the deep emotions of the time</l>
     <l n="119">To spirits cradled in a sunny clime :—</l>
     <l n="120">How many meet , who never yet have met ,</l>
     <l n="121">To part too soon , but never to forget .</l>
     <l n="122">How many saw the beauty , power and wit 120</l>
     <l n="123">Of looks and words which ne'er enchanted yet ;</l>
     <l n="124">But life 's familiar veil was now withdrawn ,</l>
     <l n="125">As the world leaps before an earthquake 's dawn ,</l>
     <l n="126">And unprophetic of the coming hours ,</l>
     <l n="127">The matin winds from the expanded flowers 125</l>
     <l n="128">Scatter their hoarded incense , and awaken</l>
     <l n="129">The earth , until the dewy sleep is shaken</l>
     <l n="130">From every living heart which it possesses ,</l>
     <l n="131">Through seas and winds , cities and wildernesses ,</l>
     <l n="132">As if the future and the past were all 130</l>
     <l n="133">Treasured i ’ the instant ;— so Gherardi 's hall</l>
     <l n="134">Laughed in the mirth of its lord 's festival ,</l>
     <l n="135">Till some one asked — ‘ Where is the Bride ? ’ And then</l>
     <l n="136">A bridesmaid went ,— and ere she came again</l>
     <l n="137">A silence fell upon the guests — a pause 135</l>
     <l n="138">Of expectation , as when beauty awes</l>
     <l n="139">All hearts with its approach , though unbeheld ;</l>
     <l n="140">Then wonder , and then fear that wonder quelled ;—</l>
     <l n="141">For whispers passed from mouth to ear which drew</l>
     <l n="142">The colour from the hearer 's cheeks , and flew 140</l>
     <l n="143">Louder and swifter round the company ;</l>
     <l n="144">And then Gherardi entered with an eye</l>
     <l n="145">Of ostentatious trouble , and a crowd</l>
     <l n="146">Surrounded him , and some were weeping loud .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="147">They found Ginevra dead ! if it be death 145</l>
     <l n="148">To lie without motion , or pulse , or breath ,</l>
     <l n="149">With waxen cheeks , and limbs cold , stiff , and white ,</l>
     <l n="150">And open eyes , whose fixed and glassy light</l>
     <l n="151">Mocked at the speculation they had owned .</l>
     <l n="152">If it be death , when there is felt around 150</l>
     <l n="153">A smell of clay , a pale and icy glare ,</l>
     <l n="154">And silence , and a sense that lifts the hair</l>
     <l n="155">From the scalp to the ankles , as it were</l>
     <l n="156">Corruption from the spirit passing forth ,</l>
     <l n="157">And giving all it shrouded to the earth , 155</l>
     <l n="158">And leaving as swift lightning in its flight</l>
     <l n="159">Ashes , and smoke , and darkness : in our night</l>
     <l n="160">Of thought we know thus much of death ,— no more</l>
     <l n="161">Than the unborn dream of our life before</l>
     <l n="162">Their barks are wrecked on its inhospitable shore . 160</l>
     <l n="163">The marriage feast and its solemnity</l>
     <l n="164">Was turned to funeral pomp — the company ,</l>
     <l n="165">With heavy hearts and looks , broke up ; nor they</l>
     <l n="166">Who loved the dead went weeping on their way</l>
     <l n="167">Alone , but sorrow mixed with sad surprise 165</l>
     <l n="168">Loosened the springs of pity in all eyes ,</l>
     <l n="169">On which that form , whose fate they weep in vain ,</l>
     <l n="170">Will never , thought they , kindle smiles again .</l>
     <l n="171">The lamps which , half extinguished in their haste ,</l>
     <l n="172">Gleamed few and faint o'er the abandoned feast , 170</l>
     <l n="173">Showed as it were within the vaulted room</l>
     <l n="174">A cloud of sorrow hanging , as if gloom</l>
     <l n="175">Had passed out of men 's minds into the air .</l>
     <l n="176">Some few yet stood around Gherardi there ,</l>
     <l n="177">Friends and relations of the dead ,— and he , 175</l>
     <l n="178">A loveless man , accepted torpidly</l>
     <l n="179">The consolation that he wanted not ;</l>
     <l n="180">Awe in the place of grief within him wrought .</l>
     <l n="181">Their whispers made the solemn silence seem</l>
     <l n="182">More still — some wept ,... 180</l>
     <l n="183">Some melted into tears without a sob ,</l>
     <l n="184">And some with hearts that might be heard to throb</l>
     <l n="185">Leaned on the table and at intervals</l>
     <l n="186">Shuddered to hear through the deserted halls</l>
     <l n="187">And corridors the thrilling shrieks which came 185</l>
     <l n="188">Upon the breeze of night , that shook the flame</l>
     <l n="189">Of every torch and taper as it swept</l>
     <l n="190">From out the chamber where the women kept ;—</l>
     <l n="191">Their tears fell on the dear companion cold</l>
     <l n="192">Of pleasures now departed ; then was knolled 190</l>
     <l n="193">The bell of death , and soon the priests arrived ,</l>
     <l n="194">And finding Death their penitent had shrived ,</l>
     <l n="195">Returned like ravens from a corpse whereon</l>
     <l n="196">A vulture has just feasted to the bone .</l>
     <l n="197">And then the mourning women came .— 195</l>

    <head>NOTE ON POEMS OF 1821 , BY MRS. SHELLEY .</head>
    <head>My task becomes inexpressibly painful as the year draws near that which sealed our earthly fate , and each poem , and each event it records , has a real or mysterious connection with the fatal catastrophe . I feel that I am incapable of putting on paper the history of those times . The heart of the man , abhorred of the poet , who could</head>
     <l n="1">‘ peep and botanize</l>
     <l n="2">Upon his mother 's grave , ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>does not appear to me more inexplicably framed than that of one who can dissect and probe past woes , and repeat to the public ear the groans drawn from them in the throes of their agony .</p>
   <p>The year 1821 was spent in Pisa , or at the Baths of San Giuliano . We were not , as our wont had been , alone ; friends had gathered round us . Nearly all are dead , and , when Memory recurs to the past , she wanders among tombs . The genius , with all his blighting errors and mighty powers ; the companion of Shelley 's ocean-wanderings , and the sharer of his fate , than whom no man ever existed more gentle , generous , and fearless ; and others , who found in Shelley 's society , and in his great knowledge and warm sympathy , delight , instruction , and solace ; have joined him beyond the grave . A few survive who have felt life a desert since he left it . What misfortune can equal death ? Change can convert every other into a blessing , or heal its sting — death alone has no cure . It shakes the foundations of the earth on which we tread ; it destroys its beauty ; it casts down our shelter ; it exposes us bare to desolation . When those we love have passed into eternity , ‘ life is the desert and the solitude ’ in which we are forced to linger — but never find comfort more .</p>
   <p>There is much in the “ Adonais ” which seems now more applicable to Shelley himself than to the young and gifted poet whom he mourned . The poetic view he takes of death , and the lofty scorn he displays towards his calumniators , are as a prophecy on his own destiny when received among immortal names , and the poisonous breath of critics has vanished into emptiness before the fame he inherits .</p>
   <p>Shelley 's favourite taste was boating ; when living near the Thames or by the Lake of Geneva , much of his life was spent on the water . On the shore of every lake or stream or sea near which he dwelt , he had a boat moored . He had latterly enjoyed this pleasure again . There are no pleasure-boats on the Arno ; and the shallowness of its waters ( except in winter-time , when the stream is too turbid and impetuous for boating ) rendered it difficult to get any skiff light enough to float . Shelley , however , overcame the difficulty ; he , together with a friend , contrived a boat such as the huntsmen carry about with them in the Maremma , to cross the sluggish but deep streams that intersect the forests ,— a boat of laths and pitched canvas . It held three persons ; and he was often seen on the Arno in it , to the horror of the Italians , who remonstrated on the danger , and could not understand how anyone could take pleasure in an exercise that risked life . ‘ Ma va per la vita ! ’ they exclaimed . I little thought how true their words would prove . He once ventured , with a friend , on the glassy sea of a calm day , down the Arno and round the coast to Leghorn , which , by keeping close in shore , was very practicable . They returned to Pisa by the canal , when , missing the direct cut , they got entangled among weeds , and the boat upset ; a wetting was all the harm done , except that the intense cold of his drenched clothes made Shelley faint . Once I went down with him to the mouth of the Arno , where the stream , then high and swift , met the tideless sea , and disturbed its sluggish waters . It was a waste and dreary scene ; the desert sand stretched into a point surrounded by waves that broke idly though perpetually around ; it was a scene very similar to Lido , of which he had said —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ I love all waste</l>
     <l n="2">And solitary places ; where we taste</l>
     <l n="3">The pleasure of believing what we see</l>
     <l n="4">Is boundless , as we wish our souls to be :</l>
     <l n="5">And such was this wide ocean , and this shore</l>
     <l n="6">More barren than its billows . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Our little boat was of greater use , unaccompanied by any danger , when we removed to the Baths . Some friends lived at the village of Pugnano , four miles off , and we went to and fro to see them , in our boat , by the canal ; which , fed by the Serchio , was , though an artificial , a full and picturesque stream , making its way under verdant banks , sheltered by trees that dipped their boughs into the murmuring waters . By day , multitudes of Ephemera darted to and fro on the surface ; at night , the fireflies came out among the shrubs on the banks ; the cicale at noon-day kept up their hum ; the aziola cooed in the quiet evening . It was a pleasant summer , bright in all but Shelley 's health and inconstant spirits ; yet he enjoyed himself greatly , and became more and more attached to the part of the country were chance appeared to cast us . Sometimes he projected taking a farm situated on the height of one of the near hills , surrounded by chestnut and pine woods , and overlooking a wide extent of country : or settling still farther in the maritime Apennines , at Massa . Several of his slighter and unfinished poems were inspired by these scenes , and by the companions around us . It is the nature of that poetry , however , which overflows from the soul oftener to express sorrow and regret than joy ; for it is when oppressed by the weight of life , and away from those he loves , that the poet has recourse to the solace of expression in verse .</p>
   <p>Still , Shelley 's passion was the ocean ; and he wished that our summers , instead of being passed among the hills near Pisa , should be spent on the shores of the sea . It was very difficult to find a spot . We shrank from Naples from a fear that the heats would disagree with Percy : Leghorn had lost its only attraction , since our friends who had resided there were returned to England ; and , Monte Nero being the resort of many English , we did not wish to find ourselves in the midst of a colony of chance travellers . No one then thought it possible to reside at Via Reggio , which latterly has become a summer resort . The low lands and bad air of Maremma stretch the whole length of the western shores of the Mediterranean , till broken by the rocks and hills of Spezia . It was a vague idea , but Shelley suggested an excursion to Spezia , to see whether it would be feasible to spend a summer there . The beauty of the bay enchanted him . We saw no house to suit us ; but the notion took root , and many circumstances , enchained as by fatality , occurred to urge him to execute it .</p>
   <p>He looked forward this autumn with great pleasure to the prospect of a visit from Leigh Hunt . When Shelley visited Lord Byron at Ravenna , the latter had suggested his coming out , together with the plan of a periodical work in which they should all join . Shelley saw a prospect of good for the fortunes of his friend , and pleasure in his society ; and instantly exerted himself to have the plan executed . He did not intend himself joining in the work : partly from pride , not wishing to have the air of acquiring readers for his poetry by associating it with the compositions of more popular writers ; and also because he might feel shackled in the free expression of his opinions , if any friends were to be compromised . By those opinions , carried even to their outermost extent , he wished to live and die , as being in his conviction not only true , but such as alone would conduce to the moral improvement and happiness of mankind . The sale of the work might meanwhile , either really or supposedly , be injured by the free expression of his thoughts ; and this evil he resolved to avoid .</p>

     <l n="46">The woods were in their winter sleep ,</l>
     <l n="47">Rocked in that repose divine</l>
     <l n="48">On the wind-swept Apennine ;</l>
     <l n="49">And dreaming , some of Autumn past ,</l>
     <l n="50">And some of Spring approaching fast , 50</l>
     <l n="51">And some of April buds and showers ,</l>
     <l n="52">And some of songs in July bowers ,</l>
     <l n="53">And all of love ; and so this tree ,—</l>
     <l n="54">O that such our death may be !—</l>
     <l n="55">Died in sleep , and felt no pain , 55</l>
     <l n="56">To live in happier form again :</l>
     <l n="57">From which , beneath Heaven 's fairest star ,</l>

   <p>With this last year of the life of Shelley these Notes end . They are not what I intended them to be . I began with energy , and a burning desire to impart to the world , in worthy language , the sense I have of the virtues and genius of the beloved and the lost ; my strength has failed under the task . Recurrence to the past , full of its own deep and unforgotten joys and sorrows , contrasted with succeeding years of painful and solitary struggle , has shaken my health . Days of great suffering have followed my attempts to write , and these again produced a weakness and languor that spread their sinister influence over these notes . I dislike speaking of myself , but cannot help apologizing to the dead , and to the public , for not having executed in the manner I desired the history I engaged to give of Shelley 's writings . ( I at one time feared that the correction of the press might be less exact through my illness ; but I believe that it is nearly free from error . Some asterisks occur in a few pages , as they did in the volume of “ Posthumous Poems ” , either because they refer to private concerns , or because the original manuscript was left imperfect . Did any one see the papers from which I drew that volume , the wonder would be how any eyes or patience were capable of extracting it from so confused a mass , interlined and broken into fragments , so that the sense could only be deciphered and joined by guesses which might seem rather intuitive than founded on reasoning . Yet I believe no mistake was made . )</p>
   <p>The winter of 1822 was passed in Pisa , if we might call that season winter in which autumn merged into spring after the interval of but few days of bleaker weather . Spring sprang up early , and with extreme beauty . Shelley had conceived the idea of writing a tragedy on the subject of Charles I . It was one that he believed adapted for a drama ; full of intense interest , contrasted character , and busy passion . He had recommended it long before , when he encouraged me to attempt a play . Whether the subject proved more difficult than he anticipated , or whether in fact he could not bend his mind away from the broodings and wanderings of thought , divested from human interest , which he best loved , I cannot tell ; but he proceeded slowly , and threw it aside for one of the most mystical of his poems , the “ Triumph of Life ” , on which he was employed at the last .</p>
   <p>His passion for boating was fostered at this time by having among our friends several sailors . His favourite companion , Edward Ellerker Williams , of the 8th Light Dragoons , had begun his life in the navy , and had afterwards entered the army ; he had spent several years in India , and his love for adventure and manly exercises accorded with Shelley 's taste . It was their favourite plan to build a boat such as they could manage themselves , and , living on the sea-coast , to enjoy at every hour and season the pleasure they loved best . Captain Roberts , R. N ., undertook to build the boat at Genoa , where he was also occupied in building the “ Bolivar ” for Lord Byron . Ours was to be an open boat , on a model taken from one of the royal dockyards . I have since heard that there was a defect in this model , and that it was never seaworthy . In the month of February , Shelley and his friend went to Spezia to seek for houses for us . Only one was to be found at all suitable ; however , a trifle such as not finding a house could not stop Shelley ; the one found was to serve for all . It was unfurnished ; we sent our furniture by sea , and with a good deal of precipitation , arising from his impatience , made our removal . We left Pisa on the 26th of April .</p>
   <p>The Bay of Spezia is of considerable extent , and divided by a rocky promontory into a larger and smaller one . The town of Lerici is situated on the eastern point , and in the depth of the smaller bay , which bears the name of this town , is the village of San Terenzo . Our house , Casa Magni , was close to this village ; the sea came up to the door , a steep hill sheltered it behind . The proprietor of the estate on which it was situated was insane ; he had begun to erect a large house at the summit of the hill behind , but his malady prevented its being finished , and it was falling into ruin . He had ( and this to the Italians had seemed a glaring symptom of very decided madness ) rooted up the olives on the hillside , and planted forest trees . These were mostly young , but the plantation was more in English taste than I ever elsewhere saw in Italy ; some fine walnut and ilex trees intermingled their dark massy foliage , and formed groups which still haunt my memory , as then they satiated the eye with a sense of loveliness . The scene was indeed of unimaginable beauty . The blue extent of waters , the almost landlocked bay , the near castle of Lerici shutting it in to the east , and distant Porto Venere to the west ; the varied forms of the precipitous rocks that bound in the beach , over which there was only a winding rugged footpath towards Lerici , and none on the other side ; the tideless sea leaving no sands nor shingle , formed a picture such as one sees in Salvator Rosa 's landscapes only . Sometimes the sunshine vanished when the sirocco raged — the ‘ ponente ’ the wind was called on that shore . The gales and squalls that hailed our first arrival surrounded the bay with foam ; the howling wind swept round our exposed house , and the sea roared unremittingly , so that we almost fancied ourselves on board ship . At other times sunshine and calm invested sea and sky , and the rich tints of Italian heaven bathed the scene in bright and ever-varying tints .</p>
   <p>The natives were wilder than the place . Our near neighbours of San Terenzo were more like savages than any people I ever before lived among . Many a night they passed on the beach , singing , or rather howling ; the women dancing about among the waves that broke at their feet , the men leaning against the rocks and joining in their loud wild chorus . We could get no provisions nearer than Sarzana , at a distance of three miles and a half off , with the torrent of the Magra between ; and even there the supply was very deficient . Had we been wrecked on an island of the South Seas , we could scarcely have felt ourselves farther from civilisation and comfort ; but , where the sun shines , the latter becomes an unnecessary luxury , and we had enough society among ourselves . Yet I confess housekeeping became rather a toilsome task , especially as I was suffering in my health , and could not exert myself actively .</p>
   <p>At first the fatal boat had not arrived , and was expected with great impatience . On Monday , 12th May , it came . Williams records the long-wished-for fact in his journal : ‘ Cloudy and threatening weather . M. Maglian called ; and after dinner , and while walking with him on the terrace , we discovered a strange sail coming round the point of Porto Venere , which proved at length to be Shelley 's boat . She had left Genoa on Thursday last , but had been driven back by the prevailing bad winds . A Mr. Heslop and two English seamen brought her round , and they speak most highly of her performances . She does indeed excite my surprise and admiration . Shelley and I walked to Lerici , and made a stretch off the land to try her : and I find she fetches whatever she looks at . In short , we have now a perfect plaything for the summer . ’ — It was thus that short-sighted mortals welcomed Death , he having disguised his grim form in a pleasing mask ! The time of the friends was now spent on the sea ; the weather became fine , and our whole party often passed the evenings on the water when the wind promised pleasant sailing . Shelley and Williams made longer excursions ; they sailed several times to Massa . They had engaged one of the seamen who brought her round , a boy , by name Charles Vivian ; and they had not the slightest apprehension of danger . When the weather was unfavourable , they employed themselves with alterations in the rigging , and by building a boat of canvas and reeds , as light as possible , to have on board the other for the convenience of landing in waters too shallow for the larger vessel . When Shelley was on board , he had his papers with him ; and much of the “ Triumph of Life ” was written as he sailed or weltered on that sea which was soon to engulf him .</p>
   <p>The heats set in in the middle of June ; the days became excessively hot . But the sea-breeze cooled the air at noon , and extreme heat always put Shelley in spirits . A long drought had preceded the heat ; and prayers for rain were being put up in the churches , and processions of relics for the same effect took place in every town . At this time we received letters announcing the arrival of Leigh Hunt at Genoa . Shelley was very eager to see him . I was confined to my room by severe illness , and could not move ; it was agreed that Shelley and Williams should go to Leghorn in the boat . Strange that no fear of danger crossed our minds ! Living on the sea-shore , the ocean became as a plaything : as a child may sport with a lighted stick , till a spark inflames a forest , and spreads destruction over all , so did we fearlessly and blindly tamper with danger , and make a game of the terrors of the ocean . Our Italian neighbours , even , trusted themselves as far as Massa in the skiff ; and the running down the line of coast to Leghorn gave no more notion of peril than a fair-weather inland navigation would have done to those who had never seen the sea . Once , some months before , Trelawny had raised a warning voice as to the difference of our calm bay and the open sea beyond ; but Shelley and his friend , with their one sailor-boy , thought themselves a match for the storms of the Mediterranean , in a boat which they looked upon as equal to all it was put to do .</p>
   <p>On the 1st of July they left us . If ever shadow of future ill darkened the present hour , such was over my mind when they went . During the whole of our stay at Lerici , an intense presentiment of coming evil brooded over my mind , and covered this beautiful place and genial summer with the shadow of coming misery . I had vainly struggled with these emotions — they seemed accounted for by my illness ; but at this hour of separation they recurred with renewed violence . I did not anticipate danger for them , but a vague expectation of evil shook me to agony , and I could scarcely bring myself to let them go . The day was calm and clear ; and , a fine breeze rising at twelve , they weighed for Leghorn . They made the run of about fifty miles in seven hours and a half . The “ Bolivar ” was in port ; and , the regulations of the Health-office not permitting them to go on shore after sunset , they borrowed cushions from the larger vessel , and slept on board their boat .</p>
   <p>They spent a week at Pisa and Leghorn . The want of rain was severely felt in the country . The weather continued sultry and fine . I have heard that Shelley all this time was in brilliant spirits . Not long before , talking of presentiment , he had said the only one that he ever found infallible was the certain advent of some evil fortune when he felt peculiarly joyous . Yet , if ever fate whispered of coming disaster , such inaudible but not unfelt prognostics hovered around us . The beauty of the place seemed unearthly in its excess : the distance we were at from all signs of civilization , the sea at our feet , its murmurs or its roaring for ever in our ears ,— all these things led the mind to brood over strange thoughts , and , lifting it from everyday life , caused it to be familiar with the unreal . A sort of spell surrounded us ; and each day , as the voyagers did not return , we grew restless and disquieted , and yet , strange to say , we were not fearful of the most apparent danger .</p>
   <p>The spell snapped ; it was all over ; an interval of agonizing doubt — of days passed in miserable journeys to gain tidings , of hopes that took firmer root even as they were more baseless — was changed to the certainty of the death that eclipsed all happiness for the survivors for evermore .</p>
   <p>There was something in our fate peculiarly harrowing . The remains of those we lost were cast on shore ; but , by the quarantine-laws of the coast , we were not permitted to have possession of them — the law with respect to everything cast on land by the sea being that such should be burned , to prevent the possibility of any remnant bringing the plague into Italy ; and no representation could alter the law . At length , through the kind and unwearied exertions of Mr. Dawkins , our Charge d'Affaires at Florence , we gained permission to receive the ashes after the bodies were consumed . Nothing could equal the zeal of Trelawny in carrying our wishes into effect . He was indefatigable in his exertions , and full of forethought and sagacity in his arrangements . It was a fearful task ; he stood before us at last , his hands scorched and blistered by the flames of the funeral-pyre , and by touching the burnt relics as he placed them in the receptacles prepared for the purpose . And there , in compass of that small case , was gathered all that remained on earth of him whose genius and virtue were a crown of glory to the world — whose love had been the source of happiness , peace , and good ,— to be buried with him !</p>
   <p>The concluding stanzas of the “ Adonais ” pointed out where the remains ought to be deposited ; in addition to which our beloved child lay buried in the cemetery at Rome . Thither Shelley 's ashes were conveyed ; and they rest beneath one of the antique weed-grown towers that recur at intervals in the circuit of the massy ancient wall of Rome . He selected the hallowed place himself ; there is</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ the sepulchre ,</l>
     <l n="2">Oh , not of him , but of our joy !—</l>
     <l n="3">...</l>
     <l n="4">And gray walls moulder round , on which dull Time</l>
     <l n="5">Feeds , like slow fire upon a hoary brand ;</l>
     <l n="6">And one keen pyramid with wedge sublime ,</l>
     <l n="7">Pavilioning the dust of him who planned</l>
     <l n="8">This refuge for his memory , doth stand</l>
     <l n="9">Like flame transformed to marble ; and beneath ,</l>
     <l n="10">A field is spread , on which a newer band</l>
     <l n="11">Have pitched in Heaven 's smile their camp of death ,</l>
     <l n="12">Welcoming him we lose with scarce extinguished breath . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Could sorrow for the lost , and shuddering anguish at the vacancy left behind , be soothed by poetic imaginations , there was something in Shelley 's fate to mitigate pangs which yet , alas ! could not be so mitigated ; for hard reality brings too miserably home to the mourner all that is lost of happiness , all of lonely unsolaced struggle that remains . Still , though dreams and hues of poetry cannot blunt grief , it invests his fate with a sublime fitness , which those less nearly allied may regard with complacency . A year before he had poured into verse all such ideas about death as give it a glory of its own . He had , as it now seems , almost anticipated his own destiny ; and , when the mind figures his skiff wrapped from sight by the thunder-storm , as it was last seen upon the purple sea , and then , as the cloud of the tempest passed away , no sign remained of where it had been ( Captain Roberts watched the vessel with his glass from the top of the lighthouse of Leghorn , on its homeward track . They were off Via Reggio , at some distance from shore , when a storm was driven over the sea . It enveloped them and several larger vessels in darkness . When the cloud passed onwards , Roberts looked again , and saw every other vessel sailing on the ocean except their little schooner , which had vanished . From that time he could scarcely doubt the fatal truth ; yet we fancied that they might have been driven towards Elba or Corsica , and so be saved . The observation made as to the spot where the boat disappeared caused it to be found , through the exertions of Trelawny for that effect . It had gone down in ten fathom water ; it had not capsized , and , except such things as had floated from her , everything was found on board exactly as it had been placed when they sailed . The boat itself was uninjured . Roberts possessed himself of her , and decked her ; but she proved not seaworthy , and her shattered planks now lie rotting on the shore of one of the Ionian islands , on which she was wrecked . ) — who but will regard as a prophecy the last stanza of the “ Adonais ” ?</p>

   <p>THE CYCLOPS .</p>
   <p>A SATYRIC DRAMA TRANSLATED FROM THE GREEK OF EURIPIDES .</p>
   <note>Published by Mrs. Shelley , “ Posthumous Poems ” , 1824 ; dated 1819 . Amongst the Shelley manuscripts at the Bodleian there is a copy , ‘ practically complete , ’ which has been collated by Mr. C. D . Locock . See “ Examination ” , etc ., 1903 , pages 64-70 . ‘ Though legible throughout , and comparatively free from corrections , it has the appearance of being a first draft ’ ( Locock ) .</note>
   <p>SILENUS . ULYSSES . CHORUS OF SATYRS . THE CYCLOPS .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : O Bacchus , what a world of toil , both now And ere these limbs were overworn with age , Have I endured for thee ! First , when thou fled'st The mountain-nymphs who nursed thee , driven afar By the strange madness Juno sent upon thee ; 5 Then in the battle of the Sons of Earth , When I stood foot by foot close to thy side , No unpropitious fellow-combatant , And , driving through his shield my winged spear , Slew vast Enceladus . Consider now , 10 Is it a dream of which I speak to thee ? By Jove it is not , for you have the trophies ! And now I suffer more than all before . For when I heard that Juno had devised A tedious voyage for you , I put to sea 15 With all my children quaint in search of you , And I myself stood on the beaked prow And fixed the naked mast ; and all my boys Leaning upon their oars , with splash and strain Made white with foam the green and purple sea ,— 20 And so we sought you , king . We were sailing Near Malea , when an eastern wind arose , And drove us to this waste Aetnean rock ; The one-eyed children of the Ocean God , The man-destroying Cyclopses , inhabit , 25 On this wild shore , their solitary caves , And one of these , named Polypheme . has caught us To be his slaves ; and so , for all delight Of Bacchic sports , sweet dance and melody , We keep this lawless giant 's wandering flocks . 30 My sons indeed on far declivities , Young things themselves , tend on the youngling sheep , But I remain to fill the water-casks , Or sweeping the hard floor , or ministering Some impious and abominable meal 35 To the fell Cyclops . I am wearied of it ! And now I must scrape up the littered floor With this great iron rake , so to receive My absent master and his evening sheep In a cave neat and clean . Even now I see 40 My children tending the flocks hitherward . Ha ! what is this ? are your Sicinnian measures Even now the same , as when with dance and song You brought young Bacchus to Althaea 's halls ?</p>
   <p>NOTE : 23 waste B .; wild 1824 ; ‘ cf . 26 , where waste is cancelled for wild ’ ( Locock ) .</p>
   <p>CHORUS OF SATYRS :</p>
   <p>STROPHE : Where has he of race divine 45 Wandered in the winding rocks ? Here the air is calm and fine For the father of the flocks ;— Here the grass is soft and sweet , And the river-eddies meet 50 In the trough beside the cave , Bright as in their fountain wave .— Neither here , nor on the dew Of the lawny uplands feeding ? Oh , you come !— a stone at you 55 Will I throw to mend your breeding ;— Get along , you horned thing , Wild , seditious , rambling !</p>
   <p>EPODE : An Iacchic melody To the golden Aphrodite 60 Will I lift , as erst did I Seeking her and her delight With the Maenads , whose white feet To the music glance and fleet . Bacchus , O beloved , where , 65 Shaking wide thy yellow hair , Wanderest thou alone , afar ? To the one-eyed Cyclops , we , Who by right thy servants are , Minister in misery , 70 In these wretched goat-skins clad , Far from thy delights and thee .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Be silent , sons ; command the slaves to drive The gathered flocks into the rock-roofed cave .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Go ! But what needs this serious haste , O father ? 75</p>
   <p>SILENUS : I see a Grecian vessel on the coast , And thence the rowers with some general Approaching to this cave .— About their necks Hang empty vessels , as they wanted food , And water-flasks .— Oh , miserable strangers ! 80 Whence come they , that they know not what and who My master is , approaching in ill hour The inhospitable roof of Polypheme , And the Cyclopian jaw-bone , man-destroying ? Be silent , Satyrs , while I ask and hear 85 Whence coming , they arrive the Aetnean hill .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Friends , can you show me some clear water-spring , The remedy of our thirst ? Will any one Furnish with food seamen in want of it ? Ha ! what is this ? We seem to be arrived 90 At the blithe court of Bacchus . I observe This sportive band of Satyrs near the caves . First let me greet the elder .— Hail !</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Hail thou , O Stranger ! tell thy country and thy race .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : The Ithacan Ulysses and the king 95 Of Cephalonia .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Oh ! I know the man , Wordy and shrewd , the son of Sisyphus .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : I am the same , but do not rail upon me .—</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Whence sailing do you come to Sicily ?</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : From Ilion , and from the Trojan toils . 100</p>
   <p>SILENUS : How , touched you not at your paternal shore ?</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : The strength of tempests bore me here by force .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : The self-same accident occurred to me .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Were you then driven here by stress of weather ?</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Following the Pirates who had kidnapped Bacchus . 105</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : What land is this , and who inhabit it ?—</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Aetna , the loftiest peak in Sicily .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : And are there walls , and tower-surrounded towns ?</p>
   <p>SILENUS : There are not .— These lone rocks are bare of men .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : And who possess the land ? the race of beasts ? 110</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Cyclops , who live in caverns , not in houses .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Obeying whom ? Or is the state popular ?</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Shepherds : no one obeys any in aught .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : How live they ? do they sow the corn of Ceres ?</p>
   <p>SILENUS : On milk and cheese , and on the flesh of sheep . 115</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Have they the Bromian drink from the vine 's stream ?</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Ah ! no ; they live in an ungracious land .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : And are they just to strangers ?— hospitable ?</p>
   <p>SILENUS : They think the sweetest thing a stranger brings Is his own flesh .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : What ! do they eat man 's flesh ? 120</p>
   <p>SILENUS : No one comes here who is not eaten up .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : The Cyclops now — where is he ? Not at home ?</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Absent on Aetna , hunting with his dogs .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Know'st thou what thou must do to aid us hence ?</p>
   <p>SILENUS : I know not : we will help you all we can . 125</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Provide us food , of which we are in want .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Here is not anything , as I said , but meat .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : But meat is a sweet remedy for hunger .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Cow 's milk there is , and store of curdled cheese .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Bring out :— I would see all before I bargain . 130</p>
   <p>SILENUS : But how much gold will you engage to give ?</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : I bring no gold , but Bacchic juice .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Oh , joy ! Tis long since these dry lips were wet with wine .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Maron , the son of the God , gave it me .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Whom I have nursed a baby in my arms . 135</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : The son of Bacchus , for your clearer knowledge .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Have you it now ?— or is it in the ship ?</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Old man , this skin contains it , which you see .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Why , this would hardly be a mouthful for me .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Nay , twice as much as you can draw from thence . 140</p>
   <p>SILENUS : You speak of a fair fountain , sweet to me .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Would you first taste of the unmingled wine ?</p>
   <p>SILENUS : ‘ Tis just — tasting invites the purchaser .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Here is the cup , together with the skin .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Pour : that the draught may fillip my remembrance .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : See ! 145</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Papaiapax ! what a sweet smell it has !</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : You see it then ?—</p>
   <p>SILENUS : By Jove , no ! but I smell it .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Taste , that you may not praise it in words only .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Babai ! Great Bacchus calls me forth to dance ! Joy ! joy !</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Did it flow sweetly down your throat ? 150</p>
   <p>SILENUS : So that it tingled to my very nails .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : And in addition I will give you gold .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Let gold alone ! only unlock the cask .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Bring out some cheeses now , or a young goat .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : That will I do , despising any master . 155 Yes , let me drink one cup , and I will give All that the Cyclops feed upon their mountains .</p>
   <p>...</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Ye have taken Troy and laid your hands on Helen ?</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : And utterly destroyed the race of Priam .</p>
   <p>...</p>
   <p>SILENUS : The wanton wretch ! she was bewitched to see 160 The many-coloured anklets and the chain Of woven gold which girt the neck of Paris , And so she left that good man Menelaus . There should be no more women in the world But such as are reserved for me alone .— 165 See , here are sheep , and here are goats , Ulysses , Here are unsparing cheeses of pressed milk ; Take them ; depart with what good speed ye may ; First leaving my reward , the Bacchic dew Of joy-inspiring grapes .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Ah me ! Alas ! 170 What shall we do ? the Cyclops is at hand ! Old man , we perish ! whither can we fly ?</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Hide yourselves quick within that hollow rock .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : ‘ Twere perilous to fly into the net .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : The cavern has recesses numberless ; 175 Hide yourselves quick .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : That will I never do ! The mighty Troy would be indeed disgraced If I should fly one man . How many times Have I withstood , with shield immovable . Ten thousand Phrygians !— if I needs must die , 180 Yet will I die with glory ;— if I live , The praise which I have gained will yet remain .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : What , ho ! assistance , comrades , haste , assistance !</p>
   <p>[ THE CYCLOPS , SILENUS , ULYSSES ; CHORUS . ]</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : What is this tumult ? Bacchus is not here , Nor tympanies nor brazen castanets . 185 How are my young lambs in the cavern ? Milking Their dams or playing by their sides ? And is The new cheese pressed into the bulrush baskets ? Speak ! I 'll beat some of you till you rain tears — Look up , not downwards when I speak to you . 190</p>
   <p>SILENUS : See ! I now gape at Jupiter himself ; I stare upon Orion and the stars .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Well , is the dinner fitly cooked and laid ?</p>
   <p>SILENUS : All ready , if your throat is ready too .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Are the bowls full of milk besides ?</p>
   <p>SILENUS : O'erhYpppHeNbrimming ; 195 So you may drink a tunful if you will .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Is it ewe 's milk or cow 's milk , or both mixed ?—</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Both , either ; only pray do n't swallow me .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : By no means .— ... What is this crowd I see beside the stalls ? 200 Outlaws or thieves ? for near my cavern-home I see my young lambs coupled two by two With willow bands ; mixed with my cheeses lie Their implements ; and this old fellow here Has his bald head broken with stripes .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Ah me ! 205 I have been beaten till I burn with fever .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : By whom ? Who laid his fist upon your head ?</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Those men , because I would not suffer them To steal your goods .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Did not the rascals know I am a God , sprung from the race of Heaven ? 210</p>
   <p>SILENUS : I told them so , but they bore off your things , And ate the cheese in spite of all I said , And carried out the lambs — and said , moreover , They 'd pin you down with a three-cubit collar , And pull your vitals out through your one eye , 215 Furrow your back with stripes , then , binding you , Throw you as ballast into the ship 's hold , And then deliver you , a slave , to move Enormous rocks , or found a vestibule .</p>
   <p>NOTE : 216 Furrow B .; Torture ( evidently misread for Furrow ) 1824 .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : In truth ? Nay , haste , and place in order quickly The cooking-knives , and heap upon the hearth , 221 And kindle it , a great faggot of wood .— As soon as they are slaughtered , they shall fill My belly , broiling warm from the live coals , Or boiled and seethed within the bubbling caldron . 225 I am quite sick of the wild mountain game ; Of stags and lions I have gorged enough , And I grow hungry for the flesh of men .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Nay , master , something new is very pleasant After one thing forever , and of late 230 Very few strangers have approached our cave .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Hear , Cyclops , a plain tale on the other side . We , wanting to buy food , came from our ship Into the neighbourhood of your cave , and here This old Silenus gave us in exchange 235 These lambs for wine , the which he took and drank , And all by mutual compact , without force . There is no word of truth in what he says , For slyly he was selling all your store .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : I ? May you perish , wretch —</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : If I speak false ! 240</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Cyclops , I swear by Neptune who begot thee , By mighty Triton and by Nereus old , Calypso and the glaucous Ocean Nymphs , The sacred waves and all the race of fishes — Be these the witnesses , my dear sweet master , 245 My darling little Cyclops , that I never Gave any of your stores to these false strangers ;— If I speak false may those whom most I love , My children , perish wretchedly !</p>
   <p>CHORUS : There stop ! I saw him giving these things to the strangers . 250 If I speak false , then may my father perish , But do not thou wrong hospitality .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : You lie ! I swear that he is juster far Than Rhadamanthus — I trust more in him . But let me ask , whence have ye sailed , O strangers ? 255 Who are you ? And what city nourished ye ?</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Our race is Ithacan — having destroyed The town of Troy , the tempests of the sea Have driven us on thy land , O Polypheme .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : What , have ye shared in the unenvied spoil 260 Of the false Helen , near Scamander 's stream ?</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : The same , having endured a woful toil .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Oh , basest expedition ! sailed ye not From Greece to Phrygia for one woman 's sake ?</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : ‘ Twas the Gods ’ work — no mortal was in fault . 265 But , O great Offspring of the Ocean-King , We pray thee and admonish thee with freedom , That thou dost spare thy friends who visit thee , And place no impious food within thy jaws . For in the depths of Greece we have upreared 270 Temples to thy great Father , which are all His homes . The sacred bay of Taenarus Remains inviolate , and each dim recess Scooped high on the Malean promontory , And aery Sunium 's silver-veined crag , 275 Which divine Pallas keeps unprofaned ever , The Gerastian asylums , and whate'er Within wide Greece our enterprise has kept From Phrygian contumely ; and in which You have a common care , for you inhabit 280 The skirts of Grecian land , under the roots Of Aetna and its crags , spotted with fire . Turn then to converse under human laws , Receive us shipwrecked suppliants , and provide Food , clothes , and fire , and hospitable gifts ; 285 Nor fixing upon oxen-piercing spits Our limbs , so fill your belly and your jaws . Priam 's wide land has widowed Greece enough ; And weapon-winged murder leaped together Enough of dead , and wives are husbandless , 290 And ancient women and gray fathers wail Their childless age ;— if you should roast the rest — And ‘ tis a bitter feast that you prepare — Where then would any turn ? Yet be persuaded ; Forgo the lust of your jaw-bone ; prefer 295 Pious humanity to wicked will : Many have bought too dear their evil joys .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Let me advise you , do not spare a morsel Of all his flesh . If you should eat his tongue You would become most eloquent , O Cyclops . 300</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Wealth , my good fellow , is the wise man 's God , All other things are a pretence and boast . What are my father 's ocean promontories , The sacred rocks whereon he dwells , to me ? Stranger , I laugh to scorn Jove 's thunderbolt , 305 I know not that his strength is more than mine . As to the rest I care not .— When he pours Rain from above , I have a close pavilion Under this rock , in which I lie supine , Feasting on a roast calf or some wild beast , 310 And drinking pans of milk , and gloriously Emulating the thunder of high Heaven . And when the Thracian wind pours down the snow , I wrap my body in the skins of beasts , Kindle a fire , and bid the snow whirl on . 315 The earth , by force , whether it will or no , Bringing forth grass , fattens my flocks and herds , Which , to what other God but to myself And this great belly , first of deities , Should I be bound to sacrifice ? I well know 320 The wise man 's only Jupiter is this , To eat and drink during his little day , And give himself no care . And as for those Who complicate with laws the life of man , I freely give them tears for their reward . 325 I will not cheat my soul of its delight , Or hesitate in dining upon you :— And that I may be quit of all demands , These are my hospitable gifts ;— fierce fire And yon ancestral caldron , which o'erhYpppHeNbubbling 330 Shall finely cook your miserable flesh . Creep in !—</p>
   <p>...</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Ai ! ai ! I have escaped the Trojan toils , I have escaped the sea , and now I fall Under the cruel grasp of one impious man . 335 O Pallas , Mistress , Goddess , sprung from Jove , Now , now , assist me ! Mightier toils than Troy Are these ;— I totter on the chasms of peril ;— And thou who inhabitest the thrones Of the bright stars , look , hospitable Jove , 340 Upon this outrage of thy deity , Otherwise be considered as no God !</p>
   <p>CHORUS ( ALONE ): For your gaping gulf and your gullet wide , The ravin is ready on every side , The limbs of the strangers are cooked and done ; 345 There is boiled meat , and roast meat , and meat from the coal , You may chop it , and tear it , and gnash it for fun , An hairy goat'shYpppHeNskin contains the whole . Let me but escape , and ferry me o'er The stream of your wrath to a safer shore . 350 The Cyclops Aetnean is cruel and bold , He murders the strangers That sit on his hearth , And dreads no avengers To rise from the earth . 355 He roasts the men before they are cold , He snatches them broiling from the coal , And from the caldron pulls them whole , And minces their flesh and gnaws their bone With his cursed teeth , till all be gone . 360 Farewell , foul pavilion : Farewell , rites of dread ! The Cyclops vermilion , With slaughter uncloying , Now feasts on the dead , 365 In the flesh of strangers joying !</p>

   <p>ULYSSES : O Jupiter ! I saw within the cave Horrible things ; deeds to be feigned in words , But not to be believed as being done .</p>
   <p>NOTE : 369 not to be believed B .; not believed 1824 .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : What ! sawest thou the impious Polypheme 370 Feasting upon your loved companions now ?</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Selecting two , the plumpest of the crowd , He grasped them in his hands .—</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Unhappy man !</p>
   <p>...</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Soon as we came into this craggy place , Kindling a fire , he cast on the broad hearth 375 The knotty limbs of an enormous oak , Three waggon-loads at least , and then he strewed Upon the ground , beside the red firelight , His couch of pine-leaves ; and he milked the cows , And pouring forth the white milk , filled a bowl 380 Three cubits wide and four in depth , as much As would contain ten amphorae , and bound it With ivy wreaths ; then placed upon the fire A brazen pot to boil , and made red hot The points of spits , not sharpened with the sickle 385 But with a fruit tree bough , and with the jaws Of axes for Aetnean slaughterings . And when this God-abandoned Cook of Hell Had made all ready , he seized two of us And killed them in a kind of measured manner ; 390 For he flung one against the brazen rivets Of the huge caldron , and seized the other By the foot 's tendon , and knocked out his brains Upon the sharp edge of the craggy stone : Then peeled his flesh with a great cooking-knife 395 And put him down to roast . The other 's limbs He chopped into the caldron to be boiled . And I , with the tears raining from my eyes , Stood near the Cyclops , ministering to him ; The rest , in the recesses of the cave , 400 Clung to the rock like bats , bloodless with fear . When he was filled with my companions ’ flesh , He threw himself upon the ground and sent A loathsome exhalation from his maw . Then a divine thought came to me . I filled 405 The cup of Maron , and I offered him To taste , and said :— ‘ Child of the Ocean God , Behold what drink the vines of Greece produce , The exultation and the joy of Bacchus . ’ He , satiated with his unnatural food , 410 Received it , and at one draught drank it off , And taking my hand , praised me :— ‘ Thou hast given A sweet draught after a sweet meal , dear guest . ’ And I , perceiving that it pleased him , filled Another cup , well knowing that the wine 415 Would wound him soon and take a sure revenge . And the charm fascinated him , and I Plied him cup after cup , until the drink Had warmed his entrails , and he sang aloud In concert with my wailing fellow-seamen 420 A hideous discord — and the cavern rung . I have stolen out , so that if you will You may achieve my safety and your own . But say , do you desire , or not , to fly This uncompanionable man , and dwell 425 As was your wont among the Grecian Nymphs Within the fanes of your beloved God ? Your father there within agrees to it , But he is weak and overcome with wine , And caught as if with bird-lime by the cup , 430 He claps his wings and crows in doting joy . You who are young escape with me , and find Bacchus your ancient friend ; unsuited he To this rude Cyclops .</p>

   <p>CHORUS : Oh my dearest friend , That I could see that day , and leave for ever 435 The impious Cyclops .</p>
   <p>...</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Listen then what a punishment I have For this fell monster , how secure a flight From your hard servitude .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : O sweeter far Than is the music of an Asian lyre 440 Would be the news of Polypheme destroyed .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Delighted with the Bacchic drink he goes To call his brother Cyclops — who inhabit A village upon Aetna not far off .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : I understand , catching him when alone 445 You think by some measure to dispatch him , Or thrust him from the precipice .</p>
   <p>NOTE : 446 by some measure 1824 ; with some measures B .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Oh no ; Nothing of that kind ; my device is subtle .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : How then ? I heard of old that thou wert wise .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : I will dissuade him from this plan , by saying 450 It were unwise to give the Cyclopses This precious drink , which if enjoyed alone Would make life sweeter for a longer time . When , vanquished by the Bacchic power , he sleeps , There is a trunk of olive wood within , 455 Whose point having made sharp with this good sword I will conceal in fire , and when I see It is alight , will fix it , burning yet , Within the socket of the Cyclops ’ eye And melt it out with fire — as when a man 460 Turns by its handle a great auger round , Fitting the framework of a ship with beams , So will I , in the Cyclops ’ fiery eye Turn round the brand and dry the pupil up .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Joy ! I am mad with joy at your device . 465</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : And then with you , my friends , and the old man , We 'll load the hollow depth of our black ship , And row with double strokes from this dread shore .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : May I , as in libations to a God , Share in the blinding him with the red brand ? 470 I would have some communion in his death .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Doubtless : the brand is a great brand to hold .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Oh ! I would lift an hundred waggon-loads , If like a wasp 's nest I could scoop the eye out Of the detested Cyclops .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Silence now ! 475 Ye know the close device — and when I call , Look ye obey the masters of the craft . I will not save myself and leave behind My comrades in the cave : I might escape , Having got clear from that obscure recess , 480 But ‘ twere unjust to leave in jeopardy The dear companions who sailed here with me .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Come ! who is first , that with his hand Will urge down the burning brand Through the lids , and quench and pierce 485 The Cyclops ’ eye so fiery fierce ?</p>
   <p>SEMICHORUS 1 [ SONG WITHIN ]: Listen ! listen ! he is coming , A most hideous discord humming . Drunken , museless , awkward , yelling , Far along his rocky dwelling ; 490 Let us with some comic spell Teach the yet unteachable . By all means he must be blinded , If my counsel be but minded .</p>
   <p>SEMICHORUS 2 : Happy thou made odorous 495 With the dew which sweet grapes weep , To the village hastening thus , Seek the vines that soothe to sleep ; Having first embraced thy friend , Thou in luxury without end , 500 With the strings of yellow hair , Of thy voluptuous leman fair , Shalt sit playing on a bed !— Speak ! what door is opened ?</p>

   <p>CYCLOPS : Ha ! ha ! ha ! I 'm full of wine , 505 Heavy with the joy divine , With the young feast oversated ; Like a merchant 's vessel freighted To the water 's edge , my crop Is laden to the gullet 's top . 510 The fresh meadow grass of spring Tempts me forth thus wandering To my brothers on the mountains , Who shall share the wine 's sweet fountains . Bring the cask , O stranger , bring ! 515</p>
   <p>NOTE : 508 merchant 's 1824 ; merchant B .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : One with eyes the fairest Cometh from his dwelling ; Some one loves thee , rarest Bright beyond my telling . In thy grace thou shinest 520 Like some nymph divinest In her caverns dewy :— All delights pursue thee , Soon pied flowers , sweet-breathing , Shall thy head be wreathing . 525</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Listen , O Cyclops , for I am well skilled In Bacchus , whom I gave thee of to drink .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : What sort of God is Bacchus then accounted ?</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : The greatest among men for joy of life .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : I gulped him down with very great delight . 530</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : This is a God who never injures men .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : How does the God like living in a skin ?</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : He is content wherever he is put .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Gods should not have their body in a skin .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : If he gives joy , what is his skin to you ? 535</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : I hate the skin , but love the wine within .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Stay here now : drink , and make your spirit glad .</p>
   <p>NOTE : 537 Stay here now , drink B .; stay here , now drink 1824 .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Should I not share this liquor with my brothers ?</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Keep it yourself , and be more honoured so .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : I were more useful , giving to my friends . 540</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : But village mirth breeds contests , broils , and blows .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : When I am drunk none shall lay hands on me .—</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : A drunken man is better within doors .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : He is a fool , who drinking , loves not mirth .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : But he is wise , who drunk , remains at home . 545</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : What shall I do , Silenus ? Shall I stay ?</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Stay — for what need have you of pot companions ?</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Indeed this place is closely carpeted With flowers and grass .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : And in the sun-warm noon ‘ Tis sweet to drink . Lie down beside me now , 550 Placing your mighty sides upon the ground .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : What do you put the cup behind me for ?</p>
   <p>SILENUS : That no one here may touch it .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Thievish One ! You want to drink ;— here place it in the midst . And thou , O stranger , tell how art thou called ? 555</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : My name is Nobody . What favour now Shall I receive to praise you at your hands ?</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : I 'll feast on you the last of your companions .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : You grant your guest a fair reward , O Cyclops .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Ha ! what is this ? Stealing the wine , you rogue ! 560</p>
   <p>SILENUS : It was this stranger kissing me because I looked so beautiful .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : You shall repent For kissing the coy wine that loves you not .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : By Jupiter ! you said that I am fair .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Pour out , and only give me the cup full . 565</p>
   <p>SILENUS : How is it mixed ? let me observe .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Curse you ! Give it me so .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Not till I see you wear That coronal , and taste the cup to you .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Thou wily traitor !</p>
   <p>SILENUS : But the wine is sweet . Ay , you will roar if you are caught in drinking . 570</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : See now , my lip is clean and all my beard .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Now put your elbow right and drink again . As you see me drink —...</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : How now ?</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Ye Gods , what a delicious gulp !</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Guest , take it ;— you pour out the wine for me . 575</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : The wine is well accustomed to my hand .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Pour out the wine !</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : I pour ; only be silent .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Silence is a hard task to him who drinks .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Take it and drink it off ; leave not a dreg . Oh that the drinker died with his own draught ! 580</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Papai ! the vine must be a sapient plant .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : If you drink much after a mighty feast , Moistening your thirsty maw , you will sleep well ; If you leave aught , Bacchus will dry you up .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Ho ! ho ! I can scarce rise . What pure delight ! 585 The heavens and earth appear to whirl about Confusedly . I see the throne of Jove And the clear congregation of the Gods . Now if the Graces tempted me to kiss I would not — for the loveliest of them all 590 I would not leave this Ganymede .</p>
   <p>SILENUS : Polypheme , I am the Ganymede of Jupiter .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : By Jove , you are ; I bore you off from Dardanus .</p>
   <p>...</p>
   <p>[ ULYSSES AND THE CHORUS . ]</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Come , boys of Bacchus , children of high race , This man within is folded up in sleep , 595 And soon will vomit flesh from his fell maw ; The brand under the shed thrusts out its smoke , No preparation needs , but to burn out The monster 's eye ;— but bear yourselves like men .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : We will have courage like the adamant rock , 600 All things are ready for you here ; go in , Before our father shall perceive the noise .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Vulcan , Aetnean king ! burn out with fire The shining eye of this thy neighbouring monster ! And thou , O Sleep , nursling of gloomy Night , 605 Descend unmixed on this God-hated beast , And suffer not Ulysses and his comrades , Returning from their famous Trojan toils , To perish by this man , who cares not either For God or mortal ; or I needs must think 610 That Chance is a supreme divinity , And things divine are subject to her power .</p>
   <p>NOTE : 606 God-hated 1824 ; God-hating ( as an alternative ) B .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Soon a crab the throat will seize Of him who feeds upon his guest , Fire will burn his lamp-like eyes 615 In revenge of such a feast ! A great oak stump now is lying In the ashes yet undying . Come , Maron , come ! Raging let him fix the doom , 620 Let him tear the eyelid up Of the Cyclops — that his cup May be evil ! Oh ! I long to dance and revel With sweet Bromian , long desired , 625 In loved ivy wreaths attired ; Leaving this abandoned home — Will the moment ever come ?</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Be silent , ye wild things ! Nay , hold your peace , And keep your lips quite close ; dare not to breathe , 630 Or spit , or e'en wink , lest ye wake the monster , Until his eye be tortured out with fire .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Nay , we are silent , and we chaw the air .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Come now , and lend a hand to the great stake Within — it is delightfully red hot . 635</p>
   <p>CHORUS : You then command who first should seize the stake To burn the Cyclops ’ eye , that all may share In the great enterprise .</p>
   <p>SEMICHORUS 1 : We are too far ; We cannot at this distance from the door Thrust fire into his eye .</p>
   <p>SEMICHORUS 2 : And we just now 640 Have become lame ! cannot move hand or foot .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : The same thing has occurred to us ,— our ankles Are sprained with standing here , I know not how .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : What , sprained with standing still ?</p>
   <p>CHORUS : And there is dust Or ashes in our eyes , I know not whence . 645</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Cowardly dogs ! ye will not aid me then ?</p>
   <p>CHORUS : With pitying my own back and my back-bone , And with not wishing all my teeth knocked out , This cowardice comes of itself — but stay , I know a famous Orphic incantation 650 To make the brand stick of its own accord Into the skull of this one-eyed son of Earth .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Of old I knew ye thus by nature ; now I know ye better .— I will use the aid Of my own comrades . Yet though weak of hand 655 Speak cheerfully , that so ye may awaken The courage of my friends with your blithe words .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : This I will do with peril of my life , And blind you with my exhortations , Cyclops . Hasten and thrust , 660 And parch up to dust , The eye of the beast Who feeds on his guest . Burn and blind The Aetnean hind ! 665 Scoop and draw , But beware lest he claw Your limbs near his maw .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Ah me ! my eyesight is parched up to cinders .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : What a sweet paean ! sing me that again ! 670</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Ah me ! indeed , what woe has fallen upon me ! But , wretched nothings , think ye not to flee Out of this rock ; I , standing at the outlet , Will bar the way and catch you as you pass .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : What are you roaring out , Cyclops ?</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : I perish ! 675</p>
   <p>CHORUS : For you are wicked .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : And besides miserable .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : What , did you fall into the fire when drunk ?</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : ‘ Twas Nobody destroyed me .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Why then no one Can be to blame .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : I say ‘ twas Nobody Who blinded me .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Why then you are not blind . 680</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : I wish you were as blind as I am .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Nay , It cannot be that no one made you blind .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : You jeer me ; where , I ask , is Nobody ?</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Nowhere , O Cyclops .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : It was that stranger ruined me :— the wretch 685 First gave me wine and then burned out my eye , For wine is strong and hard to struggle with . Have they escaped , or are they yet within ?</p>
   <p>CHORUS : They stand under the darkness of the rock And cling to it .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : At my right hand or left ? 690</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Close on your right .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Where ?</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Near the rock itself . You have them .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Oh , misfortune on misfortune ! I 've cracked my skull .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Now they escape you — there .</p>
   <p>NOTE : 693 So B .; Now they escape you there 1824 .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Not there , although you say so .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Not on that side .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Where then ?</p>
   <p>CHORUS : They creep about you on your left . 695</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Ah ! I am mocked ! They jeer me in my ills .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Not there ! he is a little there beyond you .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Detested wretch ! where are you ?</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : Far from you I keep with care this body of Ulysses .</p>

   <p>ULYSSES : My father named me so ; and I have taken A full revenge for your unnatural feast ; I should have done ill to have burned down Troy And not revenged the murder of my comrades .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Ai ! ai ! the ancient oracle is accomplished ; 705 It said that I should have my eyesight blinded By your coming from Troy , yet it foretold That you should pay the penalty for this By wandering long over the homeless sea .</p>
   <p>ULYSSES : I bid thee weep — consider what I say ; 710 I go towards the shore to drive my ship To mine own land , o'er the Sicilian wave .</p>
   <p>CYCLOPS : Not so , if , whelming you with this huge stone , I can crush you and all your men together ; I will descend upon the shore , though blind , 715 Groping my way adown the steep ravine .</p>

   <p>SCENES FROM THE MAGICO PRODIGIOSO .</p>
   <p>FROM THE SPANISH OF CALDERON .</p>

    <head>SCENE 1 :</head>
     <l n="1">ENTER CYPRIAN , DRESSED AS A STUDENT ;</l>
     <l n="2">CLARIN AND MOSCON AS POOR SCHOLARS , WITH BOOKS .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>CYPRIAN : In the sweet solitude of this calm place , This intricate wild wilderness of trees And flowers and undergrowth of odorous plants , Leave me ; the books you brought out of the house To me are ever best society . 5 And while with glorious festival and song , Antioch now celebrates the consecration Of a proud temple to great Jupiter , And bears his image in loud jubilee To its new shrine , I would consume what still 10 Lives of the dying day in studious thought , Far from the throng and turmoil . You , my friends , Go , and enjoy the festival ; it will Be worth your pains . You may return for me When the sun seeks its grave among the billows 15 Which , among dim gray clouds on the horizon , Dance like white plumes upon a hearse ;— and here I shall expect you .</p>
   <p>NOTES : 14 So transcr . ; Be worth the labour , and return for me 1824 . 16 , 17 So 1824 ; Hid among dim gray clouds on the horizon Which dance like plumes — transcr ., Forman .</p>
   <p>MOSCON : I cannot bring my mind , Great as my haste to see the festival Certainly is , to leave you , Sir , without 20 Just saying some three or four thousand words . How is it possible that on a day Of such festivity , you can be content To come forth to a solitary country With three or four old books , and turn your back 25 On all this mirth ?</p>
   <p>NOTES : 21 thousand transcr . ; hundred 1824 . 23 be content transcr . ; bring your mind 1824 .</p>
   <p>CLARIN : My master 's in the right ; There is not anything more tiresome Than a procession day , with troops , and priests , And dances , and all that .</p>
   <p>NOTE : 28 and priests transcr . ; of men 1824 .</p>
   <p>MOSCON : From first to last , Clarin , you are a temporizing flatterer ; 30 You praise not what you feel but what he does ;— Toadeater !</p>

   <p>DAEMON : ‘ Tis a foreign gentleman . 60 Even from this morning I have lost my way In this wild place ; and my poor horse at last , Quite overcome , has stretched himself upon The enamelled tapestry of this mossy mountain , And feeds and rests at the same time . I was 65 Upon my way to Antioch upon business Of some importance , but wrapped up in cares ( Who is exempt from this inheritance ? ) I parted from my company , and lost My way , and lost my servants and my comrades . 70</p>
   <p>CYPRIAN : ‘ Tis singular that even within the sight Of the high towers of Antioch you could lose Your way . Of all the avenues and green paths Of this wild wood there is not one but leads , As to its centre , to the walls of Antioch ; 75 Take which you will , you cannot miss your road .</p>
   <p>DAEMON : And such is ignorance ! Even in the sight Of knowledge , it can draw no profit from it . But as it still is early , and as I Have no acquaintances in Antioch , 80 Being a stranger there , I will even wait The few surviving hours of the day , Until the night shall conquer it . I see Both by your dress and by the books in which You find delight and company , that you 85 Are a great student ;— for my part , I feel Much sympathy in such pursuits .</p>

   <p>CYPRIAN : Pray , Sir , What science may you know ?—</p>
   <p>DAEMON : Many .</p>
   <p>CYPRIAN : Alas ! 90 Much pains must we expend on one alone , And even then attain it not ;— but you Have the presumption to assert that you Know many without study .</p>
   <p>DAEMON : And with truth . For in the country whence I come the sciences 95 Require no learning ,— they are known .</p>

   <p>CYPRIAN : Oh , would I were of that bright country ! for in this The more we study , we the more discover Our ignorance .</p>
   <p>DAEMON : It is so true , that I Had so much arrogance as to oppose 100 The chair of the most high Professorship , And obtained many votes , and , though I lost , The attempt was still more glorious , than the failure Could be dishonourable . If you believe not , Let us refer it to dispute respecting 105 That which you know the best , and although I Know not the opinion you maintain , and though It be the true one , I will take the contrary .</p>
   <p>NOTE : 106 the transcr . ; wanting , 1824 .</p>
   <p>CYPRIAN : The offer gives me pleasure . I am now Debating with myself upon a passage 110 Of Plinius , and my mind is racked with doubt To understand and know who is the God Of whom he speaks .</p>
   <p>DAEMON : It is a passage , if I recollect it right , couched in these words ‘ God is one supreme goodness , one pure essence , 115 One substance , and one sense , all sight , all hands . ’</p>
   <p>CYPRIAN : ‘ Tis true .</p>
   <p>DAEMON : What difficulty find you here ?</p>
   <p>CYPRIAN : I do not recognize among the Gods The God defined by Plinius ; if he must Be supreme goodness , even Jupiter 120 Is not supremely good ; because we see His deeds are evil , and his attributes Tainted with mortal weakness ; in what manner Can supreme goodness be consistent with The passions of humanity ?</p>
   <p>DAEMON : The wisdom 125 Of the old world masked with the names of Gods The attributes of Nature and of Man ; A sort of popular philosophy .</p>
   <p>CYPRIAN : This reply will not satisfy me , for Such awe is due to the high name of God 130 That ill should never be imputed . Then , Examining the question with more care , It follows , that the Gods would always will That which is best , were they supremely good . How then does one will one thing , one another ? 135 And that you may not say that I allege Poetical or philosophic learning :— Consider the ambiguous responses Of their oracular statues ; from two shrines Two armies shall obtain the assurance of 140 One victory . Is it not indisputable That two contending wills can never lead To the same end ? And , being opposite , If one be good , is not the other evil ? Evil in God is inconceivable ; 145 But supreme goodness fails among the Gods Without their union .</p>
   <p>NOTE : 133 would transcr . ; should 1824 .</p>
   <p>DAEMON : I deny your major . These responses are means towards some end Unfathomed by our intellectual beam . They are the work of Providence , and more 150 The battle 's loss may profit those who lose , Than victory advantage those who win .</p>
   <p>CYPRIAN : That I admit ; and yet that God should not ( Falsehood is incompatible with deity ) Assure the victory ; it would be enough 155 To have permitted the defeat . If God Be all sight ,— God , who had beheld the truth , Would not have given assurance of an end Never to be accomplished : thus , although The Deity may according to his attributes 160 Be well distinguished into persons , yet Even in the minutest circumstance His essence must be one .</p>

   <p>DAEMON : To attain the end The affections of the actors in the scene Must have been thus influenced by his voice . 165</p>
   <p>CYPRIAN : But for a purpose thus subordinate He might have employed Genii , good or evil ,— A sort of spirits called so by the learned , Who roam about inspiring good or evil , And from whose influence and existence we 170 May well infer our immortality . Thus God might easily , without descent To a gross falsehood in his proper person , Have moved the affections by this mediation To the just point .</p>

   <p>DAEMON : These trifling contradictions 175 Do not suffice to impugn the unity Of the high Gods ; in things of great importance They still appear unanimous ; consider That glorious fabric , man ,— his workmanship Is stamped with one conception .</p>
   <p>CYPRIAN : Who made man 180 Must have , methinks , the advantage of the others . If they are equal , might they not have risen In opposition to the work , and being All hands , according to our author here , Have still destroyed even as the other made ? 185 If equal in their power , unequal only In opportunity , which of the two Will remain conqueror ?</p>

   <p>DAEMON : On impossible And false hypothesis there can be built No argument . Say , what do you infer 190 From this ?</p>
   <p>CYPRIAN : That there must be a mighty God Of supreme goodness and of highest grace , All sight , all hands , all truth , infallible , Without an equal and without a rival , The cause of all things and the effect of nothing , 195 One power , one will , one substance , and one essence .

By my birth I am Held no less than yourselves to know the limits 250 Of honour and of infamy , nor has study Quenched the free spirit which first ordered them ; And thus to me , as one well experienced In the false quicksands of the sea of honour , You may refer the merits of the case ; 255 And if I should perceive in your relation That either has the right to satisfaction From the other , I give you my word of honour To leave you .</p>

Athwart the aethereal halls 25 The lightning 's arrow and the thunder-balls The day affright , As from the horizon round , Burst with earthquake sound , In mighty torrents the electric fountains ;— 30 Clouds quench the sun , and thunder-smoke Strangles the air , and fire eclipses Heaven . Philosophy , thou canst not even Compel their causes underneath thy yoke : From yonder clouds even to the waves below 35 The fragments of a single ruin choke Imagination 's flight ; For , on flakes of surge , like feathers light , The ashes of the desolation , cast Upon the gloomy blast , 40 Tell of the footsteps of the storm ; And nearer , see , the melancholy form Of a great ship , the outcast of the sea , Drives miserably ! And it must fly the pity of the port , 45 Or perish , and its last and sole resort Is its own raging enemy . The terror of the thrilling cry Was a fatal prophecy Of coming death , who hovers now 50 Upon that shattered prow , That they who die not may be dying still . And not alone the insane elements Are populous with wild portents , But that sad ship is as a miracle 55 Of sudden ruin , for it drives so fast It seems as if it had arrayed its form With the headlong storm . It strikes — I almost feel the shock ,— It stumbles on a jagged rock ,— 60 Sparkles of blood on the white foam are cast .</p>

   <p>CYPRIAN : Friend , Collect thyself ; and be the memory Of thy late suffering , and thy greatest sorrow But as a shadow of the past ,— for nothing Beneath the circle of the moon , but flows 85 And changes , and can never know repose .</p>

   <p>DAEMON : Oh , that can never be ! No solace can my lasting sorrows find . 90</p>
   <p>CYPRIAN : Wherefore ?</p>
   <p>DAEMON : Because my happiness is lost . Yet I lament what has long ceased to be The object of desire or memory , And my life is not life .</p>
   <p>CYPRIAN : Now , since the fury Of this earthquaking hurricane is still , 95 And the crystalline Heaven has reassumed Its windless calm so quickly , that it seems As if its heavy wrath had been awakened Only to overwhelm that vessel ,— speak , Who art thou , and whence comest thou ?</p>
   <p>DAEMON : Far more 100 My coming hither cost , than thou hast seen Or I can tell . Among my misadventures This shipwreck is the least . Wilt thou hear ?</p>
   <p>CYPRIAN : Speak .</p>
   <p>DAEMON : Since thou desirest , I will then unveil Myself to thee ;— for in myself I am 105 A world of happiness and misery ; This I have lost , and that I must lament Forever . In my attributes I stood So high and so heroically great , In lineage so supreme , and with a genius 110 Which penetrated with a glance the world Beneath my feet , that , won by my high merit , A king — whom I may call the King of kings , Because all others tremble in their pride Before the terrors of His countenance , 115 In His high palace roofed with brightest gems Of living light — call them the stars of Heaven — Named me His counsellor . But the high praise Stung me with pride and envy , and I rose In mighty competition , to ascend 120 His seat and place my foot triumphantly Upon His subject thrones . Chastised , I know The depth to which ambition falls ; too mad Was the attempt , and yet more mad were now Repentance of the irrevocable deed :— 125 Therefore I chose this ruin , with the glory Of not to be subdued , before the shame Of reconciling me with Him who reigns By coward cession .— Nor was I alone , Nor am I now , nor shall I be alone ; 130 And there was hope , and there may still be hope , For many suffrages among His vassals Hailed me their lord and king , and many still Are mine , and many more , perchance shall be . Thus vanquished , though in fact victorious , 135 I left His seat of empire , from mine eye Shooting forth poisonous lightning , while my words With inauspicious thunderings shook Heaven , Proclaiming vengeance , public as my wrong , And imprecating on His prostrate slaves 140 Rapine , and death , and outrage . Then I sailed Over the mighty fabric of the world ,— A pirate ambushed in its pathless sands , A lynx crouched watchfully among its caves And craggy shores ; and I have wandered over 145 The expanse of these wide wildernesses In this great ship , whose bulk is now dissolved In the light breathings of the invisible wind , And which the sea has made a dustless ruin , Seeking ever a mountain , through whose forests 150 I seek a man , whom I must now compel To keep his word with me . I came arrayed In tempest , and although my power could well Bridle the forest winds in their career , For other causes I forbore to soothe 155 Their fury to Favonian gentleness ; I could and would not ; [ ASIDE . ] ( thus I wake in him A love of magic art ) . Let not this tempest , Nor the succeeding calm excite thy wonder ; For by my art the sun would turn as pale 160 As his weak sister with unwonted fear ; And in my wisdom are the orbs of Heaven Written as in a record ; I have pierced The flaming circles of their wondrous spheres And know them as thou knowest every corner 165 Of this dim spot . Let it not seem to thee That I boast vainly ; wouldst thou that I work A charm over this waste and savage wood , This Babylon of crags and aged trees , Filling its leafy coverts with a horror 170 Thrilling and strange ? I am the friendless guest Of these wild oaks and pines — and as from thee I have received the hospitality Of this rude place , I offer thee the fruit Of years of toil in recompense ; whate'er 175 Thy wildest dream presented to thy thought As object of desire , that shall be thine .</p>

    <p n="74">THE LORD AND THE HOST OF HEAVEN .</p>
    <p n="75">ENTER THREE ARCHANGELS .</p>
    <p n="76">RAPHAEL : The sun makes music as of old Amid the rival spheres of Heaven , On its predestined circle rolled With thunder speed : the Angels even Draw strength from gazing on its glance , 5 Though none its meaning fathom may :— The world 's unwithered countenance Is bright as at Creation 's day .</p>
    <p n="77">GABRIEL : And swift and swift , with rapid lightness , The adorned Earth spins silently , 10 Alternating Elysian brightness With deep and dreadful night ; the sea Foams in broad billows from the deep Up to the rocks , and rocks and Ocean , Onward , with spheres which never sleep , 15 Are hurried in eternal motion .</p>
    <p n="78">MICHAEL : And tempests in contention roar From land to sea , from sea to land ; And , raging , weave a chain of power , Which girds the earth , as with a band .— 20 A flashing desolation there , Flames before the thunder 's way ; But Thy servants , Lord , revere The gentle changes of Thy day .</p>
    <p n="79">CHORUS OF THE THREE : The Angels draw strength from Thy glance , 25 Though no one comprehend Thee may ;— Thy world 's unwithered countenance Is bright as on Creation 's day .</p>
    <p n="80">NOTE : 28 ( RAPHAEL : The sun sounds , according to ancient custom , In the song of emulation of his brother-spheres . And its fore-written circle Fulfils with a step of thunder . Its countenance gives the Angels strength Though no one can fathom it . The incredible high works Are excellent as at the first day .</p>
    <p n="81">GABRIEL : And swift , and inconceivably swift The adornment of earth winds itself round , And exchanges Paradise-clearness With deep dreadful night . The sea foams in broad waves From its deep bottom , up to the rocks , And rocks and sea are torn on together In the eternal swift course of the spheres .</p>
    <p n="82">MICHAEL : And storms roar in emulation From sea to land , from land to sea , And make , raging , a chain Of deepest operation round about . There flames a flashing destruction Before the path of the thunderbolt . But Thy servants , Lord , revere The gentle alternations of Thy day .</p>
    <p n="83">CHORUS : Thy countenance gives the Angels strength , Though none can comprehend Thee : And all Thy lofty works Are excellent as at the first day .</p>
    <p n="84">Such is a literal translation of this astonishing chorus ; it is impossible to represent in another language the melody of the versification ; even the volatile strength and delicacy of the ideas escape in the crucible of translation , and the reader is surprised to find a caput mortuum .— [ SHELLEY 'S NOTE . ])</p>

Though I should scandalize this company , 35 You will excuse me if I do not talk In the high style which they think fashionable ; My pathos certainly would make You laugh too , Had You not long since given over laughing . Nothing know I to say of suns and worlds ; 40 I observe only how men plague themselves ;— The little god o ’ the world keeps the same stamp , As wonderful as on creation 's day :— A little better would he live , hadst Thou Not given him a glimpse of Heaven 's light 45 Which he calls reason , and employs it only To live more beastlily than any beast . With reverence to Your Lordship be it spoken , He 's like one of those long-legged grasshoppers , Who flits and jumps about , and sings for ever 50 The same old song i ’ the grass . There let him lie , Burying his nose in every heap of dung .</p>

His aspirations bear him on so far That he is half aware of his own folly , For he demands from Heaven its fairest star , 65 And from the earth the highest joy it bears , Yet all things far , and all things near , are vain To calm the deep emotions of his breast .</p>
    <p n="94">THE LORD : Though he now serves Me in a cloud of error , I will soon lead him forth to the clear day . 70 When trees look green , full well the gardener knows That fruits and blooms will deck the coming year .</p>
    <p n="95">MEPHISTOPHELES : What will You bet ?— now am sure of winning — Only , observe You give me full permission To lead him softly on my path .</p>
    <p n="96">THE LORD : As long 75 As he shall live upon the earth , so long Is nothing unto thee forbidden — Man Must err till he has ceased to struggle .</p>
    <p n="97">MEPHISTOPHELES : Thanks . And that is all I ask ; for willingly I never make acquaintance with the dead . 80 The full fresh cheeks of youth are food for me , And if a corpse knocks , I am not at home . For I am like a cat — I like to play A little with the mouse before I eat it .</p>
    <p n="98">THE LORD : Well , well ! it is permitted thee . Draw thou 85 His spirit from its springs ; as thou find'st power Seize him and lead him on thy downward path ; And stand ashamed when failure teaches thee That a good man , even in his darkest longings , Is well aware of the right way .</p>
    <p n="99">MEPHISTOPHELES : Well and good . 90 I am not in much doubt about my bet , And if I lose , then ‘ tis Your turn to crow ; Enjoy Your triumph then with a full breast . Ay ; dust shall he devour , and that with pleasure , Like my old paramour , the famous Snake . 95</p>
    <p n="100">THE LORD : Pray come here when it suits you ; for I never Had much dislike for people of your sort . And , among all the Spirits who rebelled , The knave was ever the least tedious to Me . The active spirit of man soon sleeps , and soon 100 He seeks unbroken quiet ; therefore I Have given him the Devil for a companion , Who may provoke him to some sort of work , And must create forever .— But ye , pure Children of God , enjoy eternal beauty ;— 105 Let that which ever operates and lives Clasp you within the limits of its love ; And seize with sweet and melancholy thoughts The floating phantoms of its loveliness .</p>

To creep along the labyrinths of the vales , And climb those rocks , where ever-babbling springs , Precipitate themselves in waterfalls , Is the true sport that seasons such a path . 10 Already Spring kindles the birchen spray , And the hoar pines already feel her breath : Shall she not work also within our limbs ?</p>

Through the dazzling gloom The many-coloured mice , that thread The dewy turf beneath our tread , 80 In troops each other 's motions cross , Through the heath and through the moss ; And , in legions intertangled , The fire-flies flit , and swarm , and throng , Till all the mountain depths are spangled . 85</p>

The owls fly out in strange affright ; The columns of the evergreen palaces Are split and shattered ; The roots creak , and stretch , and groan ; 130 And ruinously overthrown , The trunks are crushed and shattered By the fierce blast 's unconquerable stress . Over each other crack and crash they all In terrible and intertangled fall ; 135 And through the ruins of the shaken mountain The airs hiss and howl — It is not the voice of the fountain , Nor the wolf in his midnight prowl .

    <p n="208">[ An edition ( 250 copies ) of “ Queen Mab ” was printed at London in the summer of 1813 by Shelley himself , whose name , as author and printer , appears on the title-page ( see “ Bibliographical List ” ) . Of this edition about seventy copies were privately distributed . Sections 1 , 2 , 8 , and 9 were afterwards rehandled , and the intermediate sections here and there revised and altered ; and of this new text sections 1 and 2 were published by Shelley in the “ Alastor ” volume of 1816 , under the title , “ The Daemon of the World ” . The remainder lay unpublished till 1876 , when sections 8 and 9 were printed by Mr. H. Buxton Forman , C. B ., from a printed copy of “ Queen Mab ” with Shelley 's manuscript corrections . See “ The Shelley Library ” , pages 36-44 , for a description of this copy , which is in Mr. Forman 's possession . Sources of the text are ( 1 ) the editio princeps of 1813 ; ( 2 ) text ( with some omissions ) in the “ Poetical Works ” of 1839 , edited by Mrs. Shelley ; ( 3 ) text ( one line only wanting ) in the 2nd edition of the “ Poetical Works ” , 1839 ( same editor ) .</p>
    <p n="209">“ Queen Mab ” was probably written during the year 1812 — it is first heard of at Lynmouth , August 18 , 1812 ( “ Shelley Memorials ” , page 39 ) — but the text may be assumed to include earlier material . ]</p>

    <p>TO HARRIET *****. Whose is the love that gleaming through the world , Wards off the poisonous arrow of its scorn ? Whose is the warm and partial praise , Virtue 's most sweet reward ? Beneath whose looks did my reviving soul 5 Riper in truth and virtuous daring grow ? Whose eyes have I gazed fondly on , And loved mankind the more ? HARRIET ! on thine :— thou wert my purer mind ; Thou wert the inspiration of my song ; 10 Thine are these early wilding flowers , Though garlanded by me . Then press into thy breast this pledge of love ; And know , though time may change and years may roll , Each floweret gathered in my heart 15 It consecrates to thine . QUEEN MAB . 1 . How wonderful is Death , Death and his brother Sleep ! One , pale as yonder waning moon With lips of lurid blue ; The other , rosy as the morn 5 When throned on ocean 's wave It blushes o'er the world : Yet both so passing wonderful ! Hath then the gloomy Power Whose reign is in the tainted sepulchres 10 Seized on her sinless soul ? Must then that peerless form Which love and admiration cannot view Without a beating heart , those azure veins Which steal like streams along a field of snow , 15 That lovely outline , which is fair As breathing marble , perish ? Must putrefaction 's breath Leave nothing of this heavenly sight But loathsomeness and ruin ? 20 Spare nothing but a gloomy theme , On which the lightest heart might moralize ? Or is it only a sweet slumber Stealing o'er sensation , Which the breath of roseate morning 25 Chaseth into darkness ? Will Ianthe wake again , And give that faithful bosom joy Whose sleepless spirit waits to catch Light , life and rapture from her smile ? 30 Yes ! she will wake again , Although her glowing limbs are motionless , And silent those sweet lips , Once breathing eloquence , That might have soothed a tiger 's rage , 35 Or thawed the cold heart of a conqueror . Her dewy eyes are closed , And on their lids , whose texture fine Scarce hides the dark blue orbs beneath , The baby Sleep is pillowed : 40 Her golden tresses shade The bosom 's stainless pride , Curling like tendrils of the parasite Around a marble column . Hark ! whence that rushing sound ? 45 ‘ Tis like the wondrous strain That round a lonely ruin swells , Which , wandering on the echoing shore , The enthusiast hears at evening : ‘ Tis softer than the west wind 's sigh ; 50 ‘ Tis wilder than the unmeasured notes Of that strange lyre whose strings The genii of the breezes sweep : Those lines of rainbow light Are like the moonbeams when they fall 55 Through some cathedral window , but the tints Are such as may not find Comparison on earth . Behold the chariot of the Fairy Queen ! Celestial coursers paw the unyielding air ; 60 Their filmy pennons at her word they furl , And stop obedient to the reins of light : These the Queen of Spells drew in , She spread a charm around the spot , And leaning graceful from the aethereal car , 65 Long did she gaze , and silently , Upon the slumbering maid . Oh ! not the visioned poet in his dreams , When silvery clouds float through the ‘ wildered brain , When every sight of lovely , wild and grand 70 Astonishes , enraptures , elevates , When fancy at a glance combines The wondrous and the beautiful ,— So bright , so fair , so wild a shape Hath ever yet beheld , 75 As that which reined the coursers of the air , And poured the magic of her gaze Upon the maiden 's sleep . The broad and yellow moon Shone dimly through her form — 80 That form of faultless symmetry ; The pearly and pellucid car Moved not the moonlight 's line : ‘ Twas not an earthly pageant : Those who had looked upon the sight , 85 Passing all human glory , Saw not the yellow moon , Saw not the mortal scene , Heard not the night-wind 's rush , Heard not an earthly sound , 90 Saw but the fairy pageant , Heard but the heavenly strains That filled the lonely dwelling . The Fairy 's frame was slight , yon fibrous cloud , That catches but the palest tinge of even , 95 And which the straining eye can hardly seize When melting into eastern twilight 's shadow , Were scarce so thin , so slight ; but the fair star That gems the glittering coronet of morn , Sheds not a light so mild , so powerful , 100 As that which , bursting from the Fairy 's form , Spread a purpureal halo round the scene , Yet with an undulating motion , Swayed to her outline gracefully . From her celestial car 105 The Fairy Queen descended , And thrice she waved her wand Circled with wreaths of amaranth : Her thin and misty form Moved with the moving air , 110 And the clear silver tones , As thus she spoke , were such As are unheard by all but gifted ear . FAIRY : ‘ Stars ! your balmiest influence shed ! Elements ! your wrath suspend ! 115 Sleep , Ocean , in the rocky bounds That circle thy domain ! Let not a breath be seen to stir Around yon grass-grown ruin 's height , Let even the restless gossamer 120 Sleep on the moveless air ! Soul of Ianthe ! thou , Judged alone worthy of the envied boon , That waits the good and the sincere ; that waits Those who have struggled , and with resolute will 125 Vanquished earth 's pride and meanness , burst the chains , The icy chains of custom , and have shone The day-stars of their age ;— Soul of Ianthe ! Awake ! arise ! ’ Sudden arose 130 Ianthe 's Soul ; it stood All beautiful in naked purity , The perfect semblance of its bodily frame . Instinct with inexpressible beauty and grace , Each stain of earthliness 135 Had passed away , it reassumed Its native dignity , and stood Immortal amid ruin . Upon the couch the body lay Wrapped in the depth of slumber : 140 Its features were fixed and meaningless , Yet animal life was there , And every organ yet performed Its natural functions : ‘ twas a sight Of wonder to behold the body and soul . 145 The self-same lineaments , the same Marks of identity were there : Yet , oh , how different ! One aspires to Heaven , Pants for its sempiternal heritage , And ever-changing , ever-rising still , 150 Wantons in endless being . The other , for a time the unwilling sport Of circumstance and passion , struggles on ; Fleets through its sad duration rapidly : Then , like an useless and worn-out machine , 155 Rots , perishes , and passes . FAIRY : ‘ Spirit ! who hast dived so deep ; Spirit ! who hast soared so high ; Thou the fearless , thou the mild , Accept the boon thy worth hath earned , 160 Ascend the car with me . ’ SPIRIT : ‘ Do I dream ? Is this new feeling But a visioned ghost of slumber ? If indeed I am a soul , A free , a disembodied soul , 165 Speak again to me . ’ FAIRY : ‘ I am the Fairy MAB : to me ‘ tis given The wonders of the human world to keep : The secrets of the immeasurable past , In the unfailing consciences of men , 170 Those stern , unflattering chroniclers , I find : The future , from the causes which arise In each event , I gather : not the sting Which retributive memory implants In the hard bosom of the selfish man ; 175 Nor that ecstatic and exulting throb Which virtue 's votary feels when he sums up The thoughts and actions of a well-spent day , Are unforeseen , unregistered by me : And it is yet permitted me , to rend 180 The veil of mortal frailty , that the spirit , Clothed in its changeless purity , may know How soonest to accomplish the great end For which it hath its being , and may taste That peace , which in the end all life will share . 185 This is the meed of virtue ; happy Soul , Ascend the car with me ! ’ The chains of earth 's immurement Fell from Ianthe 's spirit ; They shrank and brake like bandages of straw 190 Beneath a wakened giant 's strength . She knew her glorious change , And felt in apprehension uncontrolled New raptures opening round : Each day-dream of her mortal life , 195 Each frenzied vision of the slumbers That closed each well-spent day , Seemed now to meet reality . The Fairy and the Soul proceeded ; The silver clouds disparted ; 200 And as the car of magic they ascended , Again the speechless music swelled , Again the coursers of the air Unfurled their azure pennons , and the Queen Shaking the beamy reins 205 Bade them pursue their way . The magic car moved on . The night was fair , and countless stars Studded Heaven 's dark blue vault ,— Just o'er the eastern wave 210 Peeped the first faint smile of morn :— The magic car moved on — From the celestial hoofs The atmosphere in flaming sparkles flew , And where the burning wheels 215 Eddied above the mountain 's loftiest peak , Was traced a line of lightning . Now it flew far above a rock , The utmost verge of earth , The rival of the Andes , whose dark brow 220 Lowered o'er the silver sea . Far , far below the chariot 's path , Calm as a slumbering babe , Tremendous Ocean lay . The mirror of its stillness showed 225 The pale and waning stars , The chariot 's fiery track , And the gray light of morn Tinging those fleecy clouds That canopied the dawn . 230 Seemed it , that the chariot 's way Lay through the midst of an immense concave , Radiant with million constellations , tinged With shades of infinite colour , And semicircled with a belt 235 Flashing incessant meteors . The magic car moved on . As they approached their goal The coursers seemed to gather speed ; The sea no longer was distinguished ; earth 240 Appeared a vast and shadowy sphere ; The sun 's unclouded orb Rolled through the black concave ; Its rays of rapid light Parted around the chariot 's swifter course , 245 And fell , like ocean 's feathery spray Dashed from the boiling surge Before a vessel 's prow . The magic car moved on . Earth 's distant orb appeared 250 The smallest light that twinkles in the heaven ; Whilst round the chariot 's way Innumerable systems rolled , And countless spheres diffused An ever-varying glory . 255 It was a sight of wonder : some Were horned like the crescent moon ; Some shed a mild and silver beam Like Hesperus o'er the western sea ; Some dashed athwart with trains of flame , 260 Like worlds to death and ruin driven ; Some shone like suns , and , as the chariot passed , Eclipsed all other light . Spirit of Nature ! here ! In this interminable wilderness 265 Of worlds , at whose immensity Even soaring fancy staggers , Here is thy fitting temple . Yet not the lightest leaf That quivers to the passing breeze 270 Is less instinct with thee : Yet not the meanest worm That lurks in graves and fattens on the dead Less shares thy eternal breath . Spirit of Nature ! thou ! 275 Imperishable as this scene , Here is thy fitting temple . 2 . If solitude hath ever led thy steps To the wild Ocean 's echoing shore , And thou hast lingered there , Until the sun 's broad orb Seemed resting on the burnished wave , 5 Thou must have marked the lines Of purple gold , that motionless Hung o'er the sinking sphere : Thou must have marked the billowy clouds Edged with intolerable radiancy 10 Towering like rocks of jet Crowned with a diamond wreath . And yet there is a moment , When the sun 's highest point Peeps like a star o'er Ocean 's western edge , 15 When those far clouds of feathery gold , Shaded with deepest purple , gleam Like islands on a dark blue sea ; Then has thy fancy soared above the earth , And furled its wearied wing 20 Within the Fairy 's fane . Yet not the golden islands Gleaming in yon flood of light , Nor the feathery curtains Stretching o'er the sun 's bright couch , 25 Nor the burnished Ocean waves Paving that gorgeous dome , So fair , so wonderful a sight As Mab 's aethereal palace could afford . Yet likest evening 's vault , that faery Hall ! 30 As Heaven , low resting on the wave , it spread Its floors of flashing light , Its vast and azure dome , Its fertile golden islands Floating on a silver sea ; 35 Whilst suns their mingling beamings darted Through clouds of circumambient darkness , And pearly battlements around Looked o'er the immense of Heaven . The magic car no longer moved . 40 The Fairy and the Spirit Entered the Hall of Spells : Those golden clouds That rolled in glittering billows Beneath the azure canopy 45 With the aethereal footsteps trembled not : The light and crimson mists , Floating to strains of thrilling melody Through that unearthly dwelling , Yielded to every movement of the will . 50 Upon their passive swell the Spirit leaned , And , for the varied bliss that pressed around , Used not the glorious privilege Of virtue and of wisdom . ‘ Spirit ! ’ the Fairy said , 55 And pointed to the gorgeous dome , ‘ This is a wondrous sight And mocks all human grandeur ; But , were it virtue 's only meed , to dwell In a celestial palace , all resigned 60 To pleasurable impulses , immured Within the prison of itself , the will Of changeless Nature would be unfulfilled . Learn to make others happy . Spirit , come ! This is thine high reward :— the past shall rise ; 65 Thou shalt behold the present ; I will teach The secrets of the future . ’ The Fairy and the Spirit Approached the overhanging battlement .— Below lay stretched the universe ! 70 There , far as the remotest line That bounds imagination 's flight , Countless and unending orbs In mazy motion intermingled , Yet still fulfilled immutably 75 Eternal Nature 's law . Above , below , around , The circling systems formed A wilderness of harmony ; Each with undeviating aim , 80 In eloquent silence , through the depths of space Pursued its wondrous way . There was a little light That twinkled in the misty distance : None but a spirit 's eye 85 Might ken that rolling orb ; None but a spirit 's eye , And in no other place But that celestial dwelling , might behold Each action of this earth 's inhabitants . 90 But matter , space and time In those aereal mansions cease to act ; And all-prevailing wisdom , when it reaps The harvest of its excellence , o'erhYpppHeNbounds Those obstacles , of which an earthly soul 95 Fears to attempt the conquest . The Fairy pointed to the earth . The Spirit 's intellectual eye Its kindred beings recognized . The thronging thousands , to a passing view , 100 Seemed like an ant-hill 's citizens . How wonderful ! that even The passions , prejudices , interests , That sway the meanest being , the weak touch That moves the finest nerve , 105 And in one human brain Causes the faintest thought , becomes a link In the great chain of Nature . ‘ Behold , ’ the Fairy cried , ‘ Palmyra 's ruined palaces !— 110 Behold ! where grandeur frowned ; Behold ! where pleasure smiled ; What now remains ?— the memory Of senselessness and shame — What is immortal there ? 115 Nothing — it stands to tell A melancholy tale , to give An awful warning : soon Oblivion will steal silently The remnant of its fame . 120 Monarchs and conquerors there Proud o'er prostrate millions trod — The earthquakes of the human race ; Like them , forgotten when the ruin That marks their shock is past . 125 ‘ Beside the eternal Nile , The Pyramids have risen . Nile shall pursue his changeless way : Those Pyramids shall fall ; Yea ! not a stone shall stand to tell 130 The spot whereon they stood ! Their very site shall be forgotten , As is their builder 's name ! ‘ Behold yon sterile spot ; Where now the wandering Arab 's tent 135 Flaps in the desert-blast . There once old Salem 's haughty fane Reared high to Heaven its thousand golden domes , And in the blushing face of day Exposed its shameful glory . 140 Oh ! many a widow , many an orphan cursed The building of that fane ; and many a father ; Worn out with toil and slavery , implored The poor man 's God to sweep it from the earth , And spare his children the detested task 145 Of piling stone on stone , and poisoning The choicest days of life , To soothe a dotard 's vanity . There an inhuman and uncultured race Howled hideous praises to their Demon-God ; 150 They rushed to war , tore from the mother 's womb The unborn child ,— old age and infancy Promiscuous perished ; their victorious arms Left not a soul to breathe . Oh ! they were fiends : But what was he who taught them that the God 155 Of nature and benevolence hath given A special sanction to the trade of blood ? His name and theirs are fading , and the tales Of this barbarian nation , which imposture Recites till terror credits , are pursuing 160 Itself into forgetfulness . ‘ Where Athens , Rome , and Sparta stood , There is a moral desert now : The mean and miserable huts , The yet more wretched palaces , 165 Contrasted with those ancient fanes , Now crumbling to oblivion ; The long and lonely colonnades , Through which the ghost of Freedom stalks , Seem like a well-known tune , 170 Which in some dear scene we have loved to hear , Remembered now in sadness . But , oh ! how much more changed , How gloomier is the contrast Of human nature there ! 175 Where Socrates expired , a tyrant 's slave , A coward and a fool , spreads death around — Then , shuddering , meets his own . Where Cicero and Antoninus lived , A cowled and hypocritical monk 180 Prays , curses and deceives . ‘ Spirit , ten thousand years Have scarcely passed away , Since , in the waste where now the savage drinks His enemy 's blood , and aping Europe 's sons , 185 Wakes the unholy song of war , Arose a stately city , Metropolis of the western continent : There , now , the mossy column-stone , Indented by Time 's unrelaxing grasp , 190 Which once appeared to brave All , save its country 's ruin ; There the wide forest scene , Rude in the uncultivated loveliness Of gardens long run wild , 195 Seems , to the unwilling sojourner , whose steps Chance in that desert has delayed , Thus to have stood since earth was what it is . Yet once it was the busiest haunt , Whither , as to a common centre , flocked 200 Strangers , and ships , and merchandise : Once peace and freedom blessed The cultivated plain : But wealth , that curse of man , Blighted the bud of its prosperity : 205 Virtue and wisdom , truth and liberty , Fled , to return not , until man shall know That they alone can give the bliss Worthy a soul that claims Its kindred with eternity . 210 ‘ There 's not one atom of yon earth But once was living man ; Nor the minutest drop of rain , That hangeth in its thinnest cloud , But flowed in human veins : 215 And from the burning plains Where Libyan monsters yell , From the most gloomy glens Of Greenland 's sunless clime , To where the golden fields 220 Of fertile England spread Their harvest to the day , Thou canst not find one spot Whereon no city stood . ‘ How strange is human pride ! 225 I tell thee that those living things , To whom the fragile blade of grass , That springeth in the morn And perisheth ere noon , Is an unbounded world ; 230 I tell thee that those viewless beings , Whose mansion is the smallest particle Of the impassive atmosphere , Think , feel and live like man ; That their affections and antipathies , 235 Like his , produce the laws Ruling their moral state ; And the minutest throb That through their frame diffuses The slightest , faintest motion , 240 Is fixed and indispensable As the majestic laws That rule yon rolling orbs . ’ The Fairy paused . The Spirit , In ecstasy of admiration , felt 245 All knowledge of the past revived ; the events Of old and wondrous times , Which dim tradition interruptedly Teaches the credulous vulgar , were unfolded In just perspective to the view ; 250 Yet dim from their infinitude . The Spirit seemed to stand High on an isolated pinnacle ; The flood of ages combating below , The depth of the unbounded universe 255 Above , and all around Nature 's unchanging harmony . 3 . ‘ Fairy ! ’ the Spirit said , And on the Queen of Spells Fixed her aethereal eyes , ‘ I thank thee . Thou hast given A boon which I will not resign , and taught 5 A lesson not to be unlearned . I know The past , and thence I will essay to glean A warning for the future , so that man May profit by his errors , and derive Experience from his folly : 10 For , when the power of imparting joy Is equal to the will , the human soul Requires no other Heaven . ’ MAB : ‘ Turn thee , surpassing Spirit ! Much yet remains unscanned . 15 Thou knowest how great is man , Thou knowest his imbecility : Yet learn thou what he is : Yet learn the lofty destiny Which restless time prepares 20 For every living soul . ‘ Behold a gorgeous palace , that , amid Yon populous city rears its thousand towers And seems itself a city . Gloomy troops Of sentinels , in stern and silent ranks , 25 Encompass it around : the dweller there Cannot be free and happy ; hearest thou not The curses of the fatherless , the groans Of those who have no friend ? He passes on : The King , the wearer of a gilded chain 30 That binds his soul to abjectness , the fool Whom courtiers nickname monarch , whilst a slave Even to the basest appetites — that man Heeds not the shriek of penury ; he smiles At the deep curses which the destitute 35 Mutter in secret , and a sullen joy Pervades his bloodless heart when thousands groan But for those morsels which his wantonness Wastes in unjoyous revelry , to save All that they love from famine : when he hears 40 The tale of horror , to some ready-made face Of hypocritical assent he turns , Smothering the glow of shame , that , spite of him , Flushes his bloated cheek . Now to the meal Of silence , grandeur , and excess , he drags 45 His palled unwilling appetite . If gold , Gleaming around , and numerous viands culled From every clime , could force the loathing sense To overcome satiety ,— if wealth The spring it draws from poisons not ,— or vice , 50 Unfeeling , stubborn vice , converteth not Its food to deadliest venom ; then that king Is happy ; and the peasant who fulfils His unforced task , when he returns at even , And by the blazing faggot meets again 55 Her welcome for whom all his toil is sped , Tastes not a sweeter meal . Behold him now Stretched on the gorgeous couch ; his fevered brain Reels dizzily awhile : but ah ! too soon The slumber of intemperance subsides , 60 And conscience , that undying serpent , calls Her venomous brood to their nocturnal task . Listen ! he speaks ! oh ! mark that frenzied eye — Oh ! mark that deadly visage . ’ KING : ‘ No cessation ! Oh ! must this last for ever ? Awful Death , 65 I wish , yet fear to clasp thee !— Not one moment Of dreamless sleep ! O dear and blessed peace ! Why dost thou shroud thy vestal purity In penury and dungeons ? wherefore lurkest With danger , death , and solitude ; yet shunn'st 70 The palace I have built thee ? Sacred peace ! Oh visit me but once , but pitying shed One drop of balm upon my withered soul . ’ THE FAIRY : ‘ Vain man ! that palace is the virtuous heart , And Peace defileth not her snowy robes 75 In such a shed as thine . Hark ! yet he mutters ; His slumbers are but varied agonies , They prey like scorpions on the springs of life . There needeth not the hell that bigots frame To punish those who err : earth in itself 80 Contains at once the evil and the cure ; And all-sufficing Nature can chastise Those who transgress her law ,— she only knows How justly to proportion to the fault The punishment it merits . Is it strange 85 That this poor wretch should pride him in his woe ? Take pleasure in his abjectness , and hug The scorpion that consumes him ? Is it strange That , placed on a conspicuous throne of thorns , Grasping an iron sceptre , and immured 90 Within a splendid prison , whose stern bounds Shut him from all that 's good or dear on earth , His soul asserts not its humanity ? That man 's mild nature rises not in war Against a king 's employ ? No — ‘ tis not strange . 95 He , like the vulgar , thinks , feels , acts and lives Just as his father did ; the unconquered powers Of precedent and custom interpose Between a KING and virtue . Stranger yet , To those who know not Nature , nor deduce 100 The future from the present , it may seem , That not one slave , who suffers from the crimes Of this unnatural being ; not one wretch , Whose children famish , and whose nuptial bed Is earth 's unpitying bosom , rears an arm To dash him from his throne ! 105 Those gilded flies That , basking in the sunshine of a court , Fatten on its corruption !— what are they ? — The drones of the community ; they feed On the mechanic 's labour : the starved hind 110 For them compels the stubborn glebe to yield Its unshared harvests ; and yon squalid form , Leaner than fleshless misery , that wastes A sunless life in the unwholesome mine , Drags out in labour a protracted death , 115 To glut their grandeur ; many faint with toil , That few may know the cares and woe of sloth . ‘ Whence , think'st thou , kings and parasites arose ? Whence that unnatural line of drones , who heap Toil and unvanquishable penury 120 On those who build their palaces , and bring Their daily bread ?— From vice , black loathsome vice ; From rapine , madness , treachery , and wrong ; From all that ‘ genders misery , and makes Of earth this thorny wilderness ; from lust , 125 Revenge , and murder ... And when Reason 's voice , Loud as the voice of Nature , shall have waked The nations ; and mankind perceive that vice Is discord , war , and misery ; that virtue Is peace , and happiness and harmony ; 130 When man 's maturer nature shall disdain The playthings of its childhood ;— kingly glare Will lose its power to dazzle ; its authority Will silently pass by ; the gorgeous throne Shall stand unnoticed in the regal hall , 135 Fast falling to decay ; whilst falsehood 's trade Shall be as hateful and unprofitable As that of truth is now . Where is the fame Which the vainglorious mighty of the earth Seek to eternize ? Oh ! the faintest sound 140 From Time 's light footfall , the minutest wave That swells the flood of ages , whelms in nothing The unsubstantial bubble . Ay ! today Stern is the tyrant 's mandate , red the gaze That flashes desolation , strong the arm 145 That scatters multitudes . To-morrow comes ! That mandate is a thunder-peal that died In ages past ; that gaze , a transient flash On which the midnight closed , and on that arm The worm has made his meal . The virtuous man , 150 Who , great in his humility , as kings Are little in their grandeur ; he who leads Invincibly a life of resolute good , And stands amid the silent dungeon depths More free and fearless than the trembling judge , 155 Who , clothed in venal power , vainly strove To bind the impassive spirit ;— when he falls , His mild eye beams benevolence no more : Withered the hand outstretched but to relieve ; Sunk Reason 's simple eloquence , that rolled 160 But to appal the guilty . Yes ! the grave Hath quenched that eye , and Death 's relentless frost Withered that arm : but the unfading fame Which Virtue hangs upon its votary 's tomb ; The deathless memory of that man , whom kings 165 Call to their mind and tremble ; the remembrance With which the happy spirit contemplates Its well-spent pilgrimage on earth , Shall never pass away . ‘ Nature rejects the monarch , not the man ; 170 The subject , not the citizen : for kings And subjects , mutual foes , forever play A losing game into each other 's hands , Whose stakes are vice and misery . The man Of virtuous soul commands not , nor obeys . 175 Power , like a desolating pestilence , Pollutes whate'er it touches ; and obedience , Bane of all genius , virtue , freedom , truth , Makes slaves of men , and , of the human frame , A mechanized automaton . When Nero , 180 High over flaming Rome , with savage joy Lowered like a fiend , drank with enraptured ear The shrieks of agonizing death , beheld The frightful desolation spread , and felt A new-created sense within his soul 185 Thrill to the sight , and vibrate to the sound ; Think'st thou his grandeur had not overcome The force of human kindness ? and , when Rome , With one stern blow , hurled not the tyrant down , Crushed not the arm red with her dearest blood 190 Had not submissive abjectness destroyed Nature 's suggestions ? Look on yonder earth : The golden harvests spring ; the unfailing sun Sheds light and life ; the fruits , the flowers , the trees , Arise in due succession ; all things speak 195 Peace , harmony , and love . The universe , In Nature 's silent eloquence , declares That all fulfil the works of love and joy ,— All but the outcast , Man . He fabricates The sword which stabs his peace ; he cherisheth 200 The snakes that gnaw his heart ; he raiseth up The tyrant , whose delight is in his woe , Whose sport is in his agony . Yon sun , Lights it the great alone ? Yon silver beams , Sleep they less sweetly on the cottage thatch 205 Than on the dome of kings ? Is mother Earth A step-dame to her numerous sons , who earn Her unshared gifts with unremitting toil ; A mother only to those puling babes Who , nursed in ease and luxury , make men 210 The playthings of their babyhood , and mar , In self-important childishness , that peace Which men alone appreciate ? ‘ Spirit of Nature ! no . The pure diffusion of thy essence throbs 215 Alike in every human heart . Thou , aye , erectest there Thy throne of power unappealable : Thou art the judge beneath whose nod Man 's brief and frail authority 220 Is powerless as the wind That passeth idly by . Thine the tribunal which surpasseth The show of human justice , As God surpasses man . 225 ‘ Spirit of Nature ! thou Life of interminable multitudes ; Soul of those mighty spheres Whose changeless paths through Heaven 's deep silence lie ; Soul of that smallest being , 230 The dwelling of whose life Is one faint April sun-gleam ;— Man , like these passive things , Thy will unconsciously fulfilleth : Like theirs , his age of endless peace , 235 Which time is fast maturing , Will swiftly , surely come ; And the unbounded frame , which thou pervadest , Will be without a flaw Marring its perfect symmetry . 240 4 . ‘ How beautiful this night ! the balmiest sigh , Which vernal zephyrs breathe in evening 's ear , Were discord to the speaking quietude That wraps this moveless scene . Heaven 's ebon vault , Studded with stars unutterably bright , 5 Through which the moon 's unclouded grandeur rolls , Seems like a canopy which love had spread To curtain her sleeping world . Yon gentle hills , Robed in a garment of untrodden snow ; Yon darksome rocks , whence icicles depend , 10 So stainless , that their white and glittering spires Tinge not the moon 's pure beam ; yon castled steep , Whose banner hangeth o'er the time-worn tower So idly , that rapt fancy deemeth it A metaphor of peace ;— all form a scene 15 Where musing Solitude might love to lift Her soul above this sphere of earthliness ; Where Silence undisturbed might watch alone , So cold , so bright , so still . The orb of day , In southern climes , o'er ocean 's waveless field 20 Sinks sweetly smiling : not the faintest breath Steals o'er the unruffled deep ; the clouds of eve Reflect unmoved the lingering beam of day ; And vesper 's image on the western main Is beautifully still . To-morrow comes : 25 Cloud upon cloud , in dark and deepening mass , Roll o'er the blackened waters ; the deep roar Of distant thunder mutters awfully ; Tempest unfolds its pinion o'er the gloom That shrouds the boiling surge ; the pitiless fiend , 30 With all his winds and lightnings , tracks his prey ; The torn deep yawns ,— the vessel finds a grave Beneath its jagged gulf . Ah ! whence yon glare That fires the arch of Heaven !— that dark red smoke Blotting the silver moon ? The stars are quenched 35 In darkness , and the pure and spangling snow Gleams faintly through the gloom that gathers round ! Hark to that roar , whose swift and deaf'ning peals In countless echoes through the mountains ring , Startling pale Midnight on her starry throne ! 40 Now swells the intermingling din ; the jar Frequent and frightful of the bursting bomb ; The falling beam , the shriek , the groan , the shout , The ceaseless clangour , and the rush of men Inebriate with rage :— loud , and more loud 45 The discord grows ; till pale Death shuts the scene , And o'er the conqueror and the conquered draws His cold and bloody shroud .— Of all the men Whom day 's departing beam saw blooming there , In proud and vigorous health ; of all the hearts 50 That beat with anxious life at sunset there ; How few survive , how few are beating now ! All is deep silence , like the fearful calm That slumbers in the storm 's portentous pause ; Save when the frantic wail of widowed love 55 Comes shuddering on the blast , or the faint moan With which some soul bursts from the frame of clay Wrapped round its struggling powers . The gray morn Dawns on the mournful scene ; the sulphurous smoke Before the icy wind slow rolls away , 60 And the bright beams of frosty morning dance Along the spangling snow . There tracks of blood Even to the forest 's depth , and scattered arms , And lifeless warriors , whose hard lineaments 65 Death 's self could change not , mark the dreadful path Of the outsallying victors : far behind , Black ashes note where their proud city stood . Within yon forest is a gloomy glen — Each tree which guards its darkness from the day , Waves o'er a warrior 's tomb . I see thee shrink , 70 Surpassing Spirit !— wert thou human else ? I see a shade of doubt and horror fleet Across thy stainless features : yet fear not ; This is no unconnected misery , Nor stands uncaused , and irretrievable . 75 Man 's evil nature , that apology Which kings who rule , and cowards who crouch , set up For their unnumbered crimes , sheds not the blood Which desolates the discord-wasted land . From kings , and priests , and statesmen , war arose , 80 Whose safety is man 's deep unbettered woe , Whose grandeur his debasement . Let the axe Strike at the root , the poison-tree will fall ; And where its venomed exhalations spread Ruin , and death , and woe , where millions lay 85 Quenching the serpent 's famine , and their bones Bleaching unburied in the putrid blast , A garden shall arise , in loveliness Surpassing fabled Eden . Hath Nature 's soul , That formed this world so beautiful , that spread 90 Earth 's lap with plenty , and life 's smallest chord Strung to unchanging unison , that gave The happy birds their dwelling in the grove , That yielded to the wanderers of the deep The lovely silence of the unfathomed main , 95 And filled the meanest worm that crawls in dust With spirit , thought , and love ; on Man alone , Partial in causeless malice , wantonly Heaped ruin , vice , and slavery ; his soul Blasted with withering curses ; placed afar 100 The meteor-happiness , that shuns his grasp , But serving on the frightful gulf to glare , Rent wide beneath his footsteps ? Nature !— no ! Kings , priests , and statesmen , blast the human flower Even in its tender bud ; their influence darts 105 Like subtle poison through the bloodless veins Of desolate society . The child , Ere he can lisp his mother 's sacred name , Swells with the unnatural pride of crime , and lifts His baby-sword even in a hero 's mood . 110 This infant-arm becomes the bloodiest scourge Of devastated earth ; whilst specious names , Learned in soft childhood 's unsuspecting hour , Serve as the sophisms with which manhood dims Bright Reason 's ray , and sanctifies the sword 115 Upraised to shed a brother 's innocent blood . Let priest-led slaves cease to proclaim that man Inherits vice and misery , when Force And Falsehood hang even o'er the cradled babe Stifling with rudest grasp all natural good . 120 ‘ Ah ! to the stranger-soul , when first it peeps From its new tenement , and looks abroad For happiness and sympathy , how stern And desolate a tract is this wide world ! How withered all the buds of natural good ! 125 No shade , no shelter from the sweeping storms Of pitiless power ! On its wretched frame , Poisoned , perchance , by the disease and woe Heaped on the wretched parent whence it sprung By morals , law , and custom , the pure winds 130 Of Heaven , that renovate the insect tribes , May breathe not . The untainting light of day May visit not its longings . It is bound Ere it has life : yea , all the chains are forged Long ere its being : all liberty and love 135 And peace is torn from its defencelessness ; Cursed from its birth , even from its cradle doomed To abjectness and bondage ! ‘ Throughout this varied and eternal world Soul is the only element : the block 140 That for uncounted ages has remained The moveless pillar of a mountain 's weight Is active , living spirit . Every grain Is sentient both in unity and part , And the minutest atom comprehends 145 A world of loves and hatreds ; these beget Evil and good : hence truth and falsehood spring ; Hence will and thought and action , all the germs Of pain or pleasure , sympathy or hate , That variegate the eternal universe . 150 Soul is not more polluted than the beams Of Heaven 's pure orb , ere round their rapid lines The taint of earth-born atmospheres arise . ‘ Man is of soul and body , formed for deeds Of high resolve , on fancy 's boldest wing 155 To soar unwearied , fearlessly to turn The keenest pangs to peacefulness , and taste The joys which mingled sense and spirit yield . Or he is formed for abjectness and woe , To grovel on the dunghill of his fears , 160 To shrink at every sound , to quench the flame Of natural love in sensualism , to know That hour as blessed when on his worthless days The frozen hand of Death shall set its seal , Yet fear the cure , though hating the disease . 165 The one is man that shall hereafter be ; The other , man as vice has made him now . ‘ War is the statesman 's game , the priest 's delight , The lawyer 's jest , the hired assassin 's trade , And , to those royal murderers , whose mean thrones 170 Are bought by crimes of treachery and gore , The bread they eat , the staff on which they lean . Guards , garbed in blood-red livery , surround Their palaces , participate the crimes That force defends , and from a nation 's rage 175 Secure the crown , which all the curses reach That famine , frenzy , woe and penury breathe . These are the hired bravos who defend The tyrant 's throne — the bullies of his fear : These are the sinks and channels of worst vice , 180 The refuse of society , the dregs Of all that is most vile : their cold hearts blend Deceit with sternness , ignorance with pride , All that is mean and villanous , with rage Which hopelessness of good , and self-contempt , 185 Alone might kindle ; they are decked in wealth , Honour and power , then are sent abroad To do their work . The pestilence that stalks In gloomy triumph through some eastern land Is less destroying . They cajole with gold , 190 And promises of fame , the thoughtless youth Already crushed with servitude : he knows His wretchedness too late , and cherishes Repentance for his ruin , when his doom Is sealed in gold and blood ! 195 Those too the tyrant serve , who , skilled to snare The feet of Justice in the toils of law , Stand , ready to oppress the weaker still ; And right or wrong will vindicate for gold , Sneering at public virtue , which beneath 200 Their pitiless tread lies torn and trampled , where Honour sits smiling at the sale of truth . ‘ Then grave and hoary-headed hypocrites , Without a hope , a passion , or a love , Who , through a life of luxury and lies , 205 Have crept by flattery to the seats of power , Support the system whence their honours flow ... They have three words :— well tyrants know their use , Well pay them for the loan , with usury Torn from a bleeding world !— God , Hell , and Heaven . 210 A vengeful , pitiless , and almighty fiend , Whose mercy is a nickname for the rage Of tameless tigers hungering for blood . Hell , a red gulf of everlasting fire , Where poisonous and undying worms prolong 215 Eternal misery to those hapless slaves Whose life has been a penance for its crimes . And Heaven , a meed for those who dare belie Their human nature , quake , believe , and cringe Before the mockeries of earthly power . 220 ‘ These tools the tyrant tempers to his work , Wields in his wrath , and as he wills destroys , Omnipotent in wickedness : the while Youth springs , age moulders , manhood tamely does His bidding , bribed by short-lived joys to lend 225 Force to the weakness of his trembling arm . ‘ They rise , they fall ; one generation comes Yielding its harvest to destruction 's scythe . It fades , another blossoms : yet behold ! Red glows the tyrant 's stamp-mark on its bloom , 230 Withering and cankering deep its passive prime . He has invented lying words and modes , Empty and vain as his own coreless heart ; Evasive meanings , nothings of much sound , To lure the heedless victim to the toils 235 Spread round the valley of its paradise . ‘ Look to thyself , priest , conqueror , or prince ! Whether thy trade is falsehood , and thy lusts Deep wallow in the earnings of the poor , With whom thy Master was :— or thou delight'st 240 In numbering o'er the myriads of thy slain , All misery weighing nothing in the scale Against thy short-lived fame : or thou dost load With cowardice and crime the groaning land , A pomp-fed king . Look to thy wretched self ! 245 Ay , art thou not the veriest slave that e'er Crawled on the loathing earth ? Are not thy days Days of unsatisfying listlessness ? Dost thou not cry , ere night 's long rack is o'er , “ When will the morning come ? ” Is not thy youth 250 A vain and feverish dream of sensualism ? Thy manhood blighted with unripe disease ? Are not thy views of unregretted death Drear , comfortless , and horrible ? Thy mind , Is it not morbid as thy nerveless frame , 255 Incapable of judgement , hope , or love ? And dost thou wish the errors to survive That bar thee from all sympathies of good , After the miserable interest Thou hold'st in their protraction ? When the grave 260 Has swallowed up thy memory and thyself , Dost thou desire the bane that poisons earth To twine its roots around thy coffined clay , Spring from thy bones , and blossom on thy tomb , That of its fruit thy babes may eat and die ? 265</p>

    <p n="216">‘ Thus do the generations of the earth Go to the grave , and issue from the womb , Surviving still the imperishable change That renovates the world ; even as the leaves Which the keen frost-wind of the waning year 5 Has scattered on the forest soil , and heaped For many seasons there — though long they choke , Loading with loathsome rottenness the land , All germs of promise , yet when the tall trees From which they fell , shorn of their lovely shapes , 10 Lie level with the earth to moulder there , They fertilize the land they long deformed , Till from the breathing lawn a forest springs Of youth , integrity , and loveliness , Like that which gave it life , to spring and die . 15 Thus suicidal selfishness , that blights The fairest feelings of the opening heart , Is destined to decay , whilst from the soil Shall spring all virtue , all delight , all love , And judgement cease to wage unnatural war 20 With passion 's unsubduable array . Twin-sister of religion , selfishness ! Rival in crime and falsehood , aping all The wanton horrors of her bloody play ; Yet frozen , unimpassioned , spiritless , 25 Shunning the light , and owning not its name , Compelled , by its deformity , to screen , With flimsy veil of justice and of right , Its unattractive lineaments , that scare All , save the brood of ignorance : at once 30 The cause and the effect of tyranny ; Unblushing , hardened , sensual , and vile ; Dead to all love but of its abjectness , With heart impassive by more noble powers Than unshared pleasure , sordid gain , or fame ; 35 Despising its own miserable being , Which still it longs , yet fears to disenthrall .</p>
    <p n="217">‘ Hence commerce springs , the venal interchange Of all that human art or nature yield ; Which wealth should purchase not , but want demand , 40 And natural kindness hasten to supply From the full fountain of its boundless love , For ever stifled , drained , and tainted now . Commerce ! beneath whose poison-breathing shade No solitary virtue dares to spring , 45 But Poverty and Wealth with equal hand Scatter their withering curses , and unfold The doors of premature and violent death , To pining famine and full-fed disease , To all that shares the lot of human life , 50 Which poisoned , body and soul , scarce drags the chain , That lengthens as it goes and clanks behind .</p>
    <p n="218">‘ Commerce has set the mark of selfishness , The signet of its all-enslaving power Upon a shining ore , and called it gold : 55 Before whose image bow the vulgar great , The vainly rich , the miserable proud , The mob of peasants , nobles , priests , and kings , And with blind feelings reverence the power That grinds them to the dust of misery . 60 But in the temple of their hireling hearts Gold is a living god , and rules in scorn All earthly things but virtue .</p>
    <p n="219">‘ Since tyrants , by the sale of human life , Heap luxuries to their sensualism , and fame 65 To their wide-wasting and insatiate pride , Success has sanctioned to a credulous world The ruin , the disgrace , the woe of war . His hosts of blind and unresisting dupes The despot numbers ; from his cabinet 70 These puppets of his schemes he moves at will , Even as the slaves by force or famine driven , Beneath a vulgar master , to perform A task of cold and brutal drudgery ;— Hardened to hope , insensible to fear , 75 Scarce living pulleys of a dead machine , Mere wheels of work and articles of trade , That grace the proud and noisy pomp of wealth !</p>
    <p n="220">‘ The harmony and happiness of man Yields to the wealth of nations ; that which lifts 80 His nature to the heaven of its pride , Is bartered for the poison of his soul ; The weight that drags to earth his towering hopes , Blighting all prospect but of selfish gain , Withering all passion but of slavish fear , 85 Extinguishing all free and generous love Of enterprise and daring , even the pulse That fancy kindles in the beating heart To mingle with sensation , it destroys ,— Leaves nothing but the sordid lust of self , 90 The grovelling hope of interest and gold , Unqualified , unmingled , unredeemed Even by hypocrisy . And statesmen boast Of wealth ! The wordy eloquence , that lives After the ruin of their hearts , can gild 95 The bitter poison of a nation 's woe , Can turn the worship of the servile mob To their corrupt and glaring idol , Fame , From Virtue , trampled by its iron tread , Although its dazzling pedestal be raised 100 Amid the horrors of a limb-strewn field , With desolated dwellings smoking round . The man of ease , who , by his warm fireside , To deeds of charitable intercourse , And bare fulfilment of the common laws 105 Of decency and prejudice , confines The struggling nature of his human heart , Is duped by their cold sophistry ; he sheds A passing tear perchance upon the wreck Of earthly peace , when near his dwelling 's door 110 The frightful waves are driven ,— when his son Is murdered by the tyrant , or religion Drives his wife raving mad . But the poor man , Whose life is misery , and fear , and care ; Whom the morn wakens but to fruitless toil ; 115 Who ever hears his famished offspring 's scream , Whom their pale mother 's uncomplaining gaze For ever meets , and the proud rich man 's eye Flashing command , and the heart-breaking scene Of thousands like himself ;— he little heeds 120 The rhetoric of tyranny ; his hate Is quenchless as his wrongs ; he laughs to scorn The vain and bitter mockery of words , Feeling the horror of the tyrant 's deeds , And unrestrained but by the arm of power , 125 That knows and dreads his enmity .</p>
    <p n="221">‘ The iron rod of Penury still compels Her wretched slave to bow the knee to wealth , And poison , with unprofitable toil , A life too void of solace to confirm 130 The very chains that bind him to his doom . Nature , impartial in munificence , Has gifted man with all-subduing will . Matter , with all its transitory shapes , Lies subjected and plastic at his feet , 135 That , weak from bondage , tremble as they tread . How many a rustic Milton has passed by , Stifling the speechless longings of his heart , In unremitting drudgery and care ! How many a vulgar Cato has compelled 140 His energies , no longer tameless then , To mould a pin , or fabricate a nail ! How many a Newton , to whose passive ken Those mighty spheres that gem infinity Were only specks of tinsel , fixed in Heaven 145 To light the midnights of his native town !</p>
    <p n="222">‘ Yet every heart contains perfection 's germ : The wisest of the sages of the earth , That ever from the stores of reason drew Science and truth , and virtue 's dreadless tone , 150 Were but a weak and inexperienced boy , Proud , sensual , unimpassioned , unimbued With pure desire and universal love , Compared to that high being , of cloudless brain , Untainted passion , elevated will , 155 Which Death ( who even would linger long in awe Within his noble presence , and beneath His changeless eyebeam ) might alone subdue . Him , every slave now dragging through the filth Of some corrupted city his sad life , 160 Pining with famine , swoln with luxury , Blunting the keenness of his spiritual sense With narrow schemings and unworthy cares , Or madly rushing through all violent crime , To move the deep stagnation of his soul ,— 165 Might imitate and equal . But mean lust Has bound its chains so tight around the earth , That all within it but the virtuous man Is venal : gold or fame will surely reach The price prefixed by selfishness , to all 170 But him of resolute and unchanging will ; Whom , nor the plaudits of a servile crowd , Nor the vile joys of tainting luxury , Can bribe to yield his elevated soul To Tyranny or Falsehood , though they wield 175 With blood-red hand the sceptre of the world .</p>
    <p n="223">‘ All things are sold : the very light of Heaven Is venal ; earth 's unsparing gifts of love , The smallest and most despicable things That lurk in the abysses of the deep , 180 All objects of our life , even life itself , And the poor pittance which the laws allow Of liberty , the fellowship of man , Those duties which his heart of human love Should urge him to perform instinctively , 185 Are bought and sold as in a public mart Of undisguising selfishness , that sets On each its price , the stamp-mark of her reign . Even love is sold ; the solace of all woe Is turned to deadliest agony , old age 190 Shivers in selfish beauty 's loathing arms , And youth 's corrupted impulses prepare A life of horror from the blighting bane Of commerce ; whilst the pestilence that springs From unenjoying sensualism , has filled 195 All human life with hydra-headed woes .</p>
    <p n="224">‘ Falsehood demands but gold to pay the pangs Of outraged conscience ; for the slavish priest Sets no great value on his hireling faith : A little passing pomp , some servile souls , 200 Whom cowardice itself might safely chain , Or the spare mite of avarice could bribe To deck the triumph of their languid zeal , Can make him minister to tyranny . More daring crime requires a loftier meed : 205 Without a shudder , the slave-soldier lends His arm to murderous deeds , and steels his heart , When the dread eloquence of dying men , Low mingling on the lonely field of fame , Assails that nature , whose applause he sells 210 For the gross blessings of a patriot mob , For the vile gratitude of heartless kings , And for a cold world 's good word ,— viler still !</p>
    <p n="225">‘ There is a nobler glory , which survives Until our being fades , and , solacing 215 All human care , accompanies its change ; Deserts not virtue in the dungeon 's gloom , And , in the precincts of the palace , guides Its footsteps through that labyrinth of crime ; Imbues his lineaments with dauntlessness , 220 Even when , from Power 's avenging hand , he takes Its sweetest , last and noblest title — death ; — The consciousness of good , which neither gold , Nor sordid fame , nor hope of heavenly bliss Can purchase ; but a life of resolute good ,— 225 Unalterable will , quenchless desire Of universal happiness , the heart That beats with it in unison , the brain , Whose ever wakeful wisdom toils to change Reason 's rich stores for its eternal weal . 230</p>
    <p n="226">‘ This commerce of sincerest virtue needs No mediative signs of selfishness , No jealous intercourse of wretched gain , No balancings of prudence , cold and long ; In just and equal measure all is weighed , 235 One scale contains the sum of human weal , And one , the good man 's heart . How vainly seek The selfish for that happiness denied To aught but virtue ! Blind and hardened , they , Who hope for peace amid the storms of care , 240 Who covet power they know not how to use , And sigh for pleasure they refuse to give ,— Madly they frustrate still their own designs ; And , where they hope that quiet to enjoy Which virtue pictures , bitterness of soul , 245 Pining regrets , and vain repentances , Disease , disgust , and lassitude , pervade Their valueless and miserable lives .</p>
    <p n="227">‘ But hoary-headed Selfishness has felt Its death-blow , and is tottering to the grave : 250 A brighter morn awaits the human day , When every transfer of earth 's natural gifts Shall be a commerce of good words and works ; When poverty and wealth , the thirst of fame , The fear of infamy , disease and woe , 255 War with its million horrors , and fierce hell Shall live but in the memory of Time , Who , like a penitent libertine , shall start , Look back , and shudder at his younger years . ’</p>
    <p n="228">6 .</p>
    <p n="229">All touch , all eye , all ear , The Spirit felt the Fairy 's burning speech . O'er the thin texture of its frame , The varying periods painted changing glows , As on a summer even , 5 When soul-enfolding music floats around , The stainless mirror of the lake Re-images the eastern gloom , Mingling convulsively its purple hues With sunset 's burnished gold . 10</p>
    <p n="230">Then thus the Spirit spoke : ‘ It is a wild and miserable world ! Thorny , and full of care , Which every fiend can make his prey at will . O Fairy ! in the lapse of years , 15 Is there no hope in store ? Will yon vast suns roll on Interminably , still illuming The night of so many wretched souls , And see no hope for them ? 20 Will not the universal Spirit e'er Revivify this withered limb of Heaven ? ’</p>
    <p n="231">The Fairy calmly smiled In comfort , and a kindling gleam of hope Suffused the Spirit 's lineaments . 25 ‘ Oh ! rest thee tranquil ; chase those fearful doubts , Which ne'er could rack an everlasting soul , That sees the chains which bind it to its doom . Yes ! crime and misery are in yonder earth , Falsehood , mistake , and lust ; 30 But the eternal world Contains at once the evil and the cure . Some eminent in virtue shall start up , Even in perversest time : The truths of their pure lips , that never die , 35 Shall bind the scorpion falsehood with a wreath Of ever-living flame , Until the monster sting itself to death .</p>
    <p n="232">‘ How sweet a scene will earth become ! Of purest spirits a pure dwelling-place , 40 Symphonious with the planetary spheres ; When man , with changeless Nature coalescing , Will undertake regeneration 's work , When its ungenial poles no longer point To the red and baleful sun 45 That faintly twinkles there .</p>
    <p n="233">‘ Spirit ! on yonder earth , Falsehood now triumphs ; deadly power Has fixed its seal upon the lip of truth ! Madness and misery are there ! 50 The happiest is most wretched ! Yet confide , Until pure health-drops , from the cup of joy , Fall like a dew of balm upon the world . Now , to the scene I show , in silence turn , And read the blood-stained charter of all woe , 55 Which Nature soon , with re-creating hand , Will blot in mercy from the book of earth . How bold the flight of Passion 's wandering wing , How swift the step of Reason 's firmer tread , How calm and sweet the victories of life , 60 How terrorless the triumph of the grave ! How powerless were the mightiest monarch 's arm , Vain his loud threat , and impotent his frown ! How ludicrous the priest 's dogmatic roar ! The weight of his exterminating curse 65 How light ! and his affected charity , To suit the pressure of the changing times , What palpable deceit !— but for thy aid , Religion ! but for thee , prolific fiend , Who peoplest earth with demons , Hell with men , 70 And Heaven with slaves !</p>
    <p n="234">‘ Thou taintest all thou look'st upon !— the stars , Which on thy cradle beamed so brightly sweet , Were gods to the distempered playfulness Of thy untutored infancy : the trees , 75 The grass , the clouds , the mountains , and the sea , All living things that walk , swim , creep , or fly , Were gods : the sun had homage , and the moon Her worshipper . Then thou becam'st , a boy , More daring in thy frenzies : every shape , 80 Monstrous or vast , or beautifully wild , Which , from sensation 's relics , fancy culls The spirits of the air , the shuddering ghost , The genii of the elements , the powers That give a shape to Nature 's varied works , 85 Had life and place in the corrupt belief Of thy blind heart : yet still thy youthful hands Were pure of human blood . Then manhood gave Its strength and ardour to thy frenzied brain ; Thine eager gaze scanned the stupendous scene , 90 Whose wonders mocked the knowledge of thy pride : Their everlasting and unchanging laws Reproached thine ignorance . Awhile thou stoodst Baffled and gloomy ; then thou didst sum up The elements of all that thou didst know ; 95 The changing seasons , winter 's leafless reign , The budding of the Heaven-breathing trees , The eternal orbs that beautify the night , The sunrise , and the setting of the moon , Earthquakes and wars , and poisons and disease , 100 And all their causes , to an abstract point Converging , thou didst bend and called it God ! The self-sufficing , the omnipotent , The merciful , and the avenging God ! Who , prototype of human misrule , sits 105 High in Heaven 's realm , upon a golden throne , Even like an earthly king ; and whose dread work , Hell , gapes for ever for the unhappy slaves Of fate , whom He created , in his sport , To triumph in their torments when they fell ! 110 Earth heard the name ; Earth trembled , as the smoke Of His revenge ascended up to Heaven , Blotting the constellations ; and the cries Of millions , butchered in sweet confidence And unsuspecting peace , even when the bonds 115 Of safety were confirmed by wordy oaths Sworn in His dreadful name , rung through the land ; Whilst innocent babes writhed on thy stubborn spear , And thou didst laugh to hear the mother 's shriek Of maniac gladness , as the sacred steel 120 Felt cold in her torn entrails !</p>
    <p n="235">‘ Religion ! thou wert then in manhood 's prime : But age crept on : one God would not suffice For senile puerility ; thou framedst A tale to suit thy dotage , and to glut 125 Thy misery-thirsting soul , that the mad fiend Thy wickedness had pictured might afford A plea for sating the unnatural thirst For murder , rapine , violence , and crime , That still consumed thy being , even when 130 Thou heardst the step of Fate ;— that flames might light Thy funeral scene , and the shrill horrent shrieks Of parents dying on the pile that burned To light their children to thy paths , the roar Of the encircling flames , the exulting cries 135 Of thine apostles , loud commingling there , Might sate thine hungry ear Even on the bed of death !</p>
    <p n="236">‘ But now contempt is mocking thy gray hairs ; Thou art descending to the darksome grave , 140 Unhonoured and unpitied , but by those Whose pride is passing by like thine , and sheds , Like thine , a glare that fades before the sun Of truth , and shines but in the dreadful night That long has lowered above the ruined world . 145</p>
    <p n="237">‘ Throughout these infinite orbs of mingling light , Of which yon earth is one , is wide diffused A Spirit of activity and life , That knows no term , cessation , or decay ; That fades not when the lamp of earthly life , 150 Extinguished in the dampness of the grave , Awhile there slumbers , more than when the babe In the dim newness of its being feels The impulses of sublunary things , And all is wonder to unpractised sense : 155 But , active , steadfast , and eternal , still Guides the fierce whirlwind , in the tempest roars , Cheers in the day , breathes in the balmy groves , Strengthens in health , and poisons in disease ; And in the storm of change , that ceaselessly 160 Rolls round the eternal universe , and shakes Its undecaying battlement , presides , Apportioning with irresistible law The place each spring of its machine shall fill ; So that when waves on waves tumultuous heap 165 Confusion to the clouds , and fiercely driven Heaven 's lightnings scorch the uprooted ocean-fords , Whilst , to the eye of shipwrecked mariner , Lone sitting on the bare and shuddering rock , All seems unlinked contingency and chance : 170 No atom of this turbulence fulfils A vague and unnecessitated task , Or acts but as it must and ought to act . Even the minutest molecule of light , That in an April sunbeam 's fleeting glow 175 Fulfils its destined , though invisible work , The universal Spirit guides ; nor less , When merciless ambition , or mad zeal , Has led two hosts of dupes to battlefield , That , blind , they there may dig each other 's graves , 180 And call the sad work glory , does it rule All passions : not a thought , a will , an act , No working of the tyrant 's moody mind , Nor one misgiving of the slaves who boast Their servitude , to hide the shame they feel , 185 Nor the events enchaining every will , That from the depths of unrecorded time Have drawn all-influencing virtue , pass Unrecognized , or unforeseen by thee , Soul of the Universe ! eternal spring 190 Of life and death , of happiness and woe , Of all that chequers the phantasmal scene That floats before our eyes in wavering light , Which gleams but on the darkness of our prison , Whose chains and massy walls 195 We feel , but cannot see .</p>
    <p n="238">‘ Spirit of Nature ! all-sufficing Power , Necessity ! thou mother of the world ! Unlike the God of human error , thou Requir'st no prayers or praises ; the caprice 200 Of man 's weak will belongs no more to thee Than do the changeful passions of his breast To thy unvarying harmony : the slave , Whose horrible lusts spread misery o'er the world , And the good man , who lifts , with virtuous pride , 205 His being , in the sight of happiness , That springs from his own works ; the poison-tree Beneath whose shade all life is withered up , And the fair oak , whose leafy dome affords A temple where the vows of happy love 210 Are registered , are equal in thy sight : No love , no hate thou cherishest ; revenge And favouritism , and worst desire of fame Thou know'st not : all that the wide world contains Are but thy passive instruments , and thou 215 Regard'st them all with an impartial eye , Whose joy or pain thy nature cannot feel , Because thou hast not human sense , Because thou art not human mind .</p>
    <p n="239">‘ Yes ! when the sweeping storm of time 220 Has sung its death-dirge o'er the ruined fanes And broken altars of the almighty Fiend Whose name usurps thy honours , and the blood Through centuries clotted there , has floated down The tainted flood of ages , shalt thou live 225 Unchangeable ! A shrine is raised to thee , Which , nor the tempest-breath of time , Nor the interminable flood , Over earth 's slight pageant rolling , Availeth to destroy ,—. 230 The sensitive extension of the world . That wondrous and eternal fane , Where pain and pleasure , good and evil join , To do the will of strong necessity , And life , in multitudinous shapes , 235 Still pressing forward where no term can be , Like hungry and unresting flame Curls round the eternal columns of its strength . ’</p>

    <p n="241">SPIRIT : ‘ I was an infant when my mother went To see an atheist burned . She took me there : The dark-robed priests were met around the pile ; The multitude was gazing silently ; And as the culprit passed with dauntless mien , 5 Tempered disdain in his unaltering eye , Mixed with a quiet smile , shone calmly forth : The thirsty fire crept round his manly limbs ; His resolute eyes were scorched to blindness soon ; His death-pang rent my heart ! the insensate mob 10 Uttered a cry of triumph , and I wept . “ Weep not , child ! ” cried my mother , “ for that man Has said , There is no God . " ’</p>
    <p n="242">FAIRY : ‘ There is no God ! Nature confirms the faith his death-groan sealed : Let heaven and earth , let man 's revolving race , 15 His ceaseless generations tell their tale ; Let every part depending on the chain That links it to the whole , point to the hand That grasps its term ! let every seed that falls In silent eloquence unfold its store 20 Of argument ; infinity within , Infinity without , belie creation ; The exterminable spirit it contains Is nature 's only God ; but human pride Is skilful to invent most serious names 25 To hide its ignorance . The name of God Has fenced about all crime with holiness , Himself the creature of His worshippers , Whose names and attributes and passions change , Seeva , Buddh , Foh , Jehovah , God , or Lord , 30 Even with the human dupes who build His shrines , Still serving o'er the war-polluted world For desolation 's watchword ; whether hosts Stain His death-blushing chariot-wheels , as on Triumphantly they roll , whilst Brahmins raise 35 A sacred hymn to mingle with the groans ; Or countless partners of His power divide His tyranny to weakness ; or the smoke Of burning towns , the cries of female helplessness , Unarmed old age , and youth , and infancy , 40 Horribly massacred , ascend to Heaven In honour of His name ; or , last and worst , Earth groans beneath religion 's iron age , And priests dare babble of a God of peace , Even whilst their hands are red with guiltless blood , 45 Murdering the while , uprooting every germ Of truth , exterminating , spoiling all , Making the earth a slaughter-house !</p>
    <p n="243">‘ O Spirit ! through the sense By which thy inner nature was apprised 50 Of outward shows , vague dreams have rolled , And varied reminiscences have waked Tablets that never fade ; All things have been imprinted there , The stars , the sea , the earth , the sky , 55 Even the unshapeliest lineaments Of wild and fleeting visions Have left a record there To testify of earth .</p>
    <p n="244">‘ These are my empire , for to me is given 60 The wonders of the human world to keep , And Fancy 's thin creations to endow With manner , being , and reality ; Therefore a wondrous phantom , from the dreams Of human error 's dense and purblind faith , 65 I will evoke , to meet thy questioning . Ahasuerus , rise ! ’</p>
    <p n="245">A strange and woe-worn wight Arose beside the battlement , And stood unmoving there . 70 His inessential figure cast no shade Upon the golden floor ; His port and mien bore mark of many years , And chronicles of untold ancientness Were legible within his beamless eye : 75 Yet his cheek bore the mark of youth ; Freshness and vigour knit his manly frame ; The wisdom of old age was mingled there With youth 's primaeval dauntlessness ; And inexpressible woe , 80 Chastened by fearless resignation , gave An awful grace to his all-speaking brow .</p>
    <p n="246">SPIRIT : ‘ Is there a God ? ’</p>
    <p n="247">AHASUERUS : ‘ Is there a God !— ay , an almighty God , And vengeful as almighty ! Once His voice 85 Was heard on earth : earth shuddered at the sound ; The fiery-visaged firmament expressed Abhorrence , and the grave of Nature yawned To swallow all the dauntless and the good That dared to hurl defiance at His throne , 90 Girt as it was with power . None but slaves Survived ,— cold-blooded slaves , who did the work Of tyrannous omnipotence ; whose souls No honest indignation ever urged To elevated daring , to one deed 95 Which gross and sensual self did not pollute . These slaves built temples for the omnipotent Fiend , Gorgeous and vast : the costly altars smoked With human blood , and hideous paeans rung Through all the long-drawn aisles . A murderer heard 100 His voice in Egypt , one whose gifts and arts Had raised him to his eminence in power , Accomplice of omnipotence in crime , And confidant of the all-knowing one . These were Jehovah 's words :— 105</p>
    <p n="248">‘ From an eternity of idleness I , God , awoke ; in seven days ’ toil made earth From nothing ; rested , and created man : I placed him in a Paradise , and there Planted the tree of evil , so that he 110 Might eat and perish , and My soul procure Wherewith to sate its malice , and to turn , Even like a heartless conqueror of the earth , All misery to My fame . The race of men Chosen to My honour , with impunity 115 May sate the lusts I planted in their heart . Here I command thee hence to lead them on , Until , with hardened feet , their conquering troops Wade on the promised soil through woman 's blood , And make My name be dreaded through the land . 120 Yet ever-burning flame and ceaseless woe Shall be the doom of their eternal souls , With every soul on this ungrateful earth , Virtuous or vicious , weak or strong ,— even all Shall perish , to fulfil the blind revenge 125 ( Which you , to men , call justice ) of their God . ’</p>
    <p n="249">The murderer 's brow Quivered with horror . ‘ God omnipotent , Is there no mercy ? must our punishment Be endless ? will long ages roll away , 130 And see no term ? Oh ! wherefore hast Thou made In mockery and wrath this evil earth ? Mercy becomes the powerful — be but just : O God ! repent and save . ’</p>
    <p n="250">‘ One way remains : I will beget a Son , and He shall bear 135 The sins of all the world ; He shall arise In an unnoticed corner of the earth , And there shall die upon a cross , and purge The universal crime ; so that the few On whom My grace descends , those who are marked 140 As vessels to the honour of their God , May credit this strange sacrifice , and save Their souls alive : millions shall live and die , Who ne'er shall call upon their Saviour 's name , But , unredeemed , go to the gaping grave . 145 Thousands shall deem it an old woman 's tale , Such as the nurses frighten babes withal : These in a gulf of anguish and of flame Shall curse their reprobation endlessly , Yet tenfold pangs shall force them to avow , 150 Even on their beds of torment , where they howl , My honour , and the justice of their doom . What then avail their virtuous deeds , their thoughts Of purity , with radiant genius bright , Or lit with human reason 's earthly ray ? 155 Many are called , but few will I elect . Do thou My bidding , Moses ! ’ Even the murderer 's cheek Was blanched with horror , and his quivering lips Scarce faintly uttered — ‘ O almighty One , I tremble and obey ! ’ 160</p>
    <p n="251">‘ O Spirit ! centuries have set their seal On this heart of many wounds , and loaded brain , Since the Incarnate came : humbly He came , Veiling His horrible Godhead in the shape Of man , scorned by the world , His name unheard , 165 Save by the rabble of His native town , Even as a parish demagogue . He led The crowd ; He taught them justice , truth , and peace , In semblance ; but He lit within their souls The quenchless flames of zeal , and blessed the sword 170 He brought on earth to satiate with the blood Of truth and freedom His malignant soul . At length His mortal frame was led to death . I stood beside Him : on the torturing cross No pain assailed His unterrestrial sense ; 175 And yet He groaned . Indignantly I summed The massacres and miseries which His name Had sanctioned in my country , and I cried , “ Go ! Go ! ” in mockery . A smile of godlike malice reillumed 180 His fading lineaments .— “ I go , ” He cried , “ But thou shalt wander o'er the unquiet earth Eternally . ” — The dampness of the grave Bathed my imperishable front . I fell , And long lay tranced upon the charmed soil . 185 When I awoke Hell burned within my brain , Which staggered on its seat ; for all around The mouldering relics of my kindred lay , Even as the Almighty 's ire arrested them , And in their various attitudes of death 190 My murdered children 's mute and eyeless skulls Glared ghastily upon me . But my soul , From sight and sense of the polluting woe Of tyranny , had long learned to prefer Hell 's freedom to the servitude of Heaven . 195 Therefore I rose , and dauntlessly began My lonely and unending pilgrimage , Resolved to wage unweariable war With my almighty Tyrant , and to hurl Defiance at His impotence to harm 200 Beyond the curse I bore . The very hand That barred my passage to the peaceful grave Has crushed the earth to misery , and given Its empire to the chosen of His slaves . These have I seen , even from the earliest dawn 205 Of weak , unstable and precarious power , Then preaching peace , as now they practise war ; So , when they turned but from the massacre Of unoffending infidels , to quench Their thirst for ruin in the very blood 210 That flowed in their own veins , and pitiless zeal Froze every human feeling , as the wife Sheathed in her husband 's heart the sacred steel , Even whilst its hopes were dreaming of her love ; And friends to friends , brothers to brothers stood 215 Opposed in bloodiest battle-field , and war , Scarce satiable by fate 's last death-draught , waged , Drunk from the winepress of the Almighty 's wrath ; Whilst the red cross , in mockery of peace , Pointed to victory ! When the fray was done , 220 No remnant of the exterminated faith Survived to tell its ruin , but the flesh , With putrid smoke poisoning the atmosphere , That rotted on the half-extinguished pile .</p>
    <p n="252">‘ Yes ! I have seen God 's worshippers unsheathe 225 The sword of His revenge , when grace descended , Confirming all unnatural impulses , To sanctify their desolating deeds ; And frantic priests waved the ill-omened cross O'er the unhappy earth : then shone the sun 230 On showers of gore from the upflashing steel Of safe assassination , and all crime Made stingless by the Spirits of the Lord , And blood-red rainbows canopied the land . ‘ Spirit , no year of my eventful being 235 Has passed unstained by crime and misery , Which flows from God 's own faith . I 've marked His slaves With tongues whose lies are venomous , beguile The insensate mob , and , whilst one hand was red With murder , feign to stretch the other out 240 For brotherhood and peace ; and that they now Babble of love and mercy , whilst their deeds Are marked with all the narrowness and crime That Freedom 's young arm dare not yet chastise , Reason may claim our gratitude , who now 245 Establishing the imperishable throne Of truth , and stubborn virtue , maketh vain The unprevailing malice of my Foe , Whose bootless rage heaps torments for the brave , Adds impotent eternities to pain , 250 Whilst keenest disappointment racks His breast To see the smiles of peace around them play , To frustrate or to sanctify their doom .</p>
    <p n="253">‘ Thus have I stood ,— through a wild waste of years Struggling with whirlwinds of mad agony , 255 Yet peaceful , and serene , and self-enshrined , Mocking my powerless Tyrant 's horrible curse With stubborn and unalterable will , Even as a giant oak , which Heaven 's fierce flame Had scathed in the wilderness , to stand 260 A monument of fadeless ruin there ; Yet peacefully and movelessly it braves The midnight conflict of the wintry storm , As in the sunlight 's calm it spreads Its worn and withered arms on high 265 To meet the quiet of a summer 's noon . ’</p>
    <p n="254">The Fairy waved her wand : Ahasuerus fled Fast as the shapes of mingled shade and mist , That lurk in the glens of a twilight grove , 270 Flee from the morning beam : The matter of which dreams are made Not more endowed with actual life Than this phantasmal portraiture Of wandering human thought . 275</p>

    <p n="257">THE FAIRY : ‘ The Present and the Past thou hast beheld : It was a desolate sight . Now , Spirit , learn The secrets of the Future .— Time ! Unfold the brooding pinion of thy gloom , Render thou up thy half-devoured babes , 5 And from the cradles of eternity , Where millions lie lulled to their portioned sleep By the deep murmuring stream of passing things , Tear thou that gloomy shroud .— Spirit , behold Thy glorious destiny ! ’ 10</p>
    <p n="258">Joy to the Spirit came . Through the wide rent in Time 's eternal veil , Hope was seen beaming through the mists of fear : Earth was no longer Hell ; Love , freedom , health , had given 15 Their ripeness to the manhood of its prime , And all its pulses beat Symphonious to the planetary spheres : Then dulcet music swelled Concordant with the life-strings of the soul ; 20 It throbbed in sweet and languid beatings there , Catching new life from transitory death ,— Like the vague sighings of a wind at even , That wakes the wavelets of the slumbering sea And dies on the creation of its breath , 25 And sinks and rises , fails and swells by fits : Was the pure stream of feeling That sprung from these sweet notes , And o'er the Spirit 's human sympathies With mild and gentle motion calmly flowed . 30</p>
    <p n="259">Joy to the Spirit came ,— Such joy as when a lover sees The chosen of his soul in happiness , And witnesses her peace Whose woe to him were bitterer than death , 35 Sees her unfaded cheek Glow mantling in first luxury of health , Thrills with her lovely eyes , Which like two stars amid the heaving main Sparkle through liquid bliss . 40</p>
    <p n="260">Then in her triumph spoke the Fairy Queen : ‘ I will not call the ghost of ages gone To unfold the frightful secrets of its lore ; The present now is past , And those events that desolate the earth 45 Have faded from the memory of Time , Who dares not give reality to that Whose being I annul . To me is given The wonders of the human world to keep , Space , matter , time , and mind . Futurity 50 Exposes now its treasure ; let the sight Renew and strengthen all thy failing hope . O human Spirit ! spur thee to the goal Where virtue fixes universal peace , And midst the ebb and flow of human things , 55 Show somewhat stable , somewhat certain still , A lighthouse o'er the wild of dreary waves .</p>
    <p n="261">‘ The habitable earth is full of bliss ; Those wastes of frozen billows that were hurled By everlasting snowstorms round the poles , 60 Where matter dared not vegetate or live , But ceaseless frost round the vast solitude Bound its broad zone of stillness , are unloosed ; And fragrant zephyrs there from spicy isles Ruffle the placid ocean-deep , that rolls 65 Its broad , bright surges to the sloping sand , Whose roar is wakened into echoings sweet To murmur through the Heaven-breathing groves And melodize with man 's blest nature there .</p>
    <p n="262">‘ Those deserts of immeasurable sand , 70 Whose age-collected fervours scarce allowed A bird to live , a blade of grass to spring , Where the shrill chirp of the green lizard 's love Broke on the sultry silentness alone , Now teem with countless rills and shady woods , 75 Cornfields and pastures and white cottages ; And where the startled wilderness beheld A savage conqueror stained in kindred blood , A tigress sating with the flesh of lambs The unnatural famine of her toothless cubs , 80 Whilst shouts and howlings through the desert rang , Sloping and smooth the daisy-spangled lawn , Offering sweet incense to the sunrise , smiles To see a babe before his mother 's door , Sharing his morning 's meal 85 With the green and golden basilisk That comes to lick his feet .</p>
    <p n="263">‘ Those trackless deeps , where many a weary sail Has seen above the illimitable plain , Morning on night , and night on morning rise , 90 Whilst still no land to greet the wanderer spread Its shadowy mountains on the sun-bright sea , Where the loud roarings of the tempest-waves So long have mingled with the gusty wind In melancholy loneliness , and swept 95 The desert of those ocean solitudes , But vocal to the sea-bird 's harrowing shriek , The bellowing monster , and the rushing storm , Now to the sweet and many-mingling sounds Of kindliest human impulses respond . 100 Those lonely realms bright garden-isles begem , With lightsome clouds and shining seas between , And fertile valleys , resonant with bliss , Whilst green woods overcanopy the wave , Which like a toil-worn labourer leaps to shore , 105 To meet the kisses of the flow'rets there .</p>
    <p n="264">‘ All things are recreated , and the flame Of consentaneous love inspires all life : The fertile bosom of the earth gives suck To myriads , who still grow beneath her care , 110 Rewarding her with their pure perfectness : The balmy breathings of the wind inhale Her virtues , and diffuse them all abroad : Health floats amid the gentle atmosphere , Glows in the fruits , and mantles on the stream : 115 No storms deform the beaming brow of Heaven , Nor scatter in the freshness of its pride The foliage of the ever-verdant trees ; But fruits are ever ripe , flowers ever fair , And Autumn proudly bears her matron grace , 120 Kindling a flush on the fair cheek of Spring , Whose virgin bloom beneath the ruddy fruit Reflects its tint , and blushes into love .</p>
    <p n="265">‘ The lion now forgets to thirst for blood : There might you see him sporting in the sun 125 Beside the dreadless kid ; his claws are sheathed , His teeth are harmless , custom 's force has made His nature as the nature of a lamb . Like passion 's fruit , the nightshade 's tempting bane Poisons no more the pleasure it bestows : 130 All bitterness is past ; the cup of joy Unmingled mantles to the goblet 's brim , And courts the thirsty lips it fled before .</p>
    <p n="266">‘ But chief , ambiguous Man , he that can know More misery , and dream more joy than all ; 135 Whose keen sensations thrill within his breast To mingle with a loftier instinct there , Lending their power to pleasure and to pain , Yet raising , sharpening , and refining each ; Who stands amid the ever-varying world , 140 The burthen or the glory of the earth ; He chief perceives the change , his being notes The gradual renovation , and defines Each movement of its progress on his mind .</p>
    <p n="267">‘ Man , where the gloom of the long polar night 145 Lowers o'er the snow-clad rocks and frozen soil , Where scarce the hardiest herb that braves the frost Basks in the moonlight 's ineffectual glow , Shrank with the plants , and darkened with the night ; His chilled and narrow energies , his heart , 150 Insensible to courage , truth , or love , His stunted stature and imbecile frame , Marked him for some abortion of the earth , Fit compeer of the bears that roamed around , Whose habits and enjoyments were his own : 155 His life a feverish dream of stagnant woe , Whose meagre wants , but scantily fulfilled , Apprised him ever of the joyless length Which his short being 's wretchedness had reached ; His death a pang which famine , cold and toil 160 Long on the mind , whilst yet the vital spark Clung to the body stubbornly , had brought : All was inflicted here that Earth 's revenge Could wreak on the infringers of her law ; One curse alone was spared — the name of God . 165</p>
    <p n="268">‘ Nor where the tropics bound the realms of day With a broad belt of mingling cloud and flame , Where blue mists through the unmoving atmosphere Scattered the seeds of pestilence , and fed Unnatural vegetation , where the land 170 Teemed with all earthquake , tempest and disease , Was Man a nobler being ; slavery Had crushed him to his country 's bloodstained dust ; Or he was bartered for the fame of power , Which all internal impulses destroying , 175 Makes human will an article of trade ; Or he was changed with Christians for their gold , And dragged to distant isles , where to the sound Of the flesh-mangling scourge , he does the work Of all-polluting luxury and wealth , 180 Which doubly visits on the tyrants ’ heads The long-protracted fulness of their woe ; Or he was led to legal butchery , To turn to worms beneath that burning sun , Where kings first leagued against the rights of men , 185 And priests first traded with the name of God .</p>
    <p n="269">‘ Even where the milder zone afforded Man A seeming shelter , yet contagion there , Blighting his being with unnumbered ills , Spread like a quenchless fire ; nor truth till late 190 Availed to arrest its progress , or create That peace which first in bloodless victory waved Her snowy standard o'er this favoured clime : There man was long the train-bearer of slaves , The mimic of surrounding misery , 195 The jackal of ambition 's lion-rage , The bloodhound of religion 's hungry zeal . ‘ Here now the human being stands adorning This loveliest earth with taintless body and mind ; Blessed from his birth with all bland impulses , 200 Which gently in his noble bosom wake All kindly passions and all pure desires . Him , still from hope to hope the bliss pursuing Which from the exhaustless lore of human weal Dawns on the virtuous mind , the thoughts that rise 205 In time-destroying infiniteness , gift With self-enshrined eternity , that mocks The unprevailing hoariness of age , And man , once fleeting o'er the transient scene Swift as an unremembered vision , stands 210 Immortal upon earth : no longer now He slays the lamb that looks him in the face , And horribly devours his mangled flesh , Which , still avenging Nature 's broken law , Kindled all putrid humours in his frame , 215 All evil passions , and all vain belief , Hatred , despair , and loathing in his mind , The germs of misery , death , disease , and crime . No longer now the winged habitants , That in the woods their sweet lives sing away ,— 220 Flee from the form of man ; but gather round , And prune their sunny feathers on the hands Which little children stretch in friendly sport Towards these dreadless partners of their play . All things are void of terror : Man has lost 225 His terrible prerogative , and stands An equal amidst equals : happiness And science dawn though late upon the earth ; Peace cheers the mind , health renovates the frame ; Disease and pleasure cease to mingle here , 230 Reason and passion cease to combat there ; Whilst each unfettered o'er the earth extend Their all-subduing energies , and wield The sceptre of a vast dominion there ; Whilst every shape and mode of matter lends 235 Its force to the omnipotence of mind , Which from its dark mine drags the gem of truth To decorate its Paradise of peace . ’</p>

    <p n="272">‘ O happy Earth ! reality of Heaven ! To which those restless souls that ceaselessly Throng through the human universe , aspire ; Thou consummation of all mortal hope ! Thou glorious prize of blindly-working will ! 5 Whose rays , diffused throughout all space and time , Verge to one point and blend for ever there : Of purest spirits thou pure dwelling-place ! Where care and sorrow , impotence and crime , Languor , disease , and ignorance dare not come : 10 O happy Earth , reality of Heaven !</p>
    <p n="273">‘ Genius has seen thee in her passionate dreams , And dim forebodings of thy loveliness Haunting the human heart , have there entwined Those rooted hopes of some sweet place of bliss 15 Where friends and lovers meet to part no more . Thou art the end of all desire and will , The product of all action ; and the souls That by the paths of an aspiring change Have reached thy haven of perpetual peace , 20 There rest from the eternity of toil That framed the fabric of thy perfectness .</p>
    <p n="274">‘ Even Time , the conqueror , fled thee in his fear ; That hoary giant , who , in lonely pride , So long had ruled the world , that nations fell 25 Beneath his silent footstep . Pyramids , That for millenniums had withstood the tide Of human things , his storm-breath drove in sand Across that desert where their stones survived The name of him whose pride had heaped them there . 30 Yon monarch , in his solitary pomp , Was but the mushroom of a summer day , That his light-winged footstep pressed to dust : Time was the king of earth : all things gave way Before him , but the fixed and virtuous will , 35 The sacred sympathies of soul and sense , That mocked his fury and prepared his fall .</p>
    <p n="275">‘ Yet slow and gradual dawned the morn of love ; Long lay the clouds of darkness o'er the scene , Till from its native Heaven they rolled away : 40 First , Crime triumphant o'er all hope careered Unblushing , undisguising , bold and strong ; Whilst Falsehood , tricked in Virtue 's attributes , Long sanctified all deeds of vice and woe , Till done by her own venomous sting to death , 45 She left the moral world without a law , No longer fettering Passion 's fearless wing ,— Nor searing Reason with the brand of God . Then steadily the happy ferment worked ; Reason was free ; and wild though Passion went 50 Through tangled glens and wood-embosomed meads , Gathering a garland of the strangest flowers , Yet like the bee returning to her queen , She bound the sweetest on her sister 's brow , Who meek and sober kissed the sportive child , 55 No longer trembling at the broken rod .</p>
    <p n="276">‘ Mild was the slow necessity of death : The tranquil spirit failed beneath its grasp , Without a groan , almost without a fear , Calm as a voyager to some distant land , 60 And full of wonder , full of hope as he . The deadly germs of languor and disease Died in the human frame , and Purity Blessed with all gifts her earthly worshippers . How vigorous then the athletic form of age ! 65 How clear its open and unwrinkled brow ! Where neither avarice , cunning , pride , nor care , Had stamped the seal of gray deformity On all the mingling lineaments of time . How lovely the intrepid front of youth ! 70 Which meek-eyed courage decked with freshest grace ;— Courage of soul , that dreaded not a name , And elevated will , that journeyed on Through life 's phantasmal scene in fearlessness , With virtue , love , and pleasure , hand in hand . 75</p>
    <p n="277">‘ Then , that sweet bondage which is Freedom 's self , And rivets with sensation 's softest tie The kindred sympathies of human souls , Needed no fetters of tyrannic law : Those delicate and timid impulses 80 In Nature 's primal modesty arose , And with undoubted confidence disclosed The growing longings of its dawning love , Unchecked by dull and selfish chastity , That virtue of the cheaply virtuous , 85 Who pride themselves in senselessness and frost . No longer prostitution 's venomed bane Poisoned the springs of happiness and life ; Woman and man , in confidence and love , Equal and free and pure together trod 90 The mountain-paths of virtue , which no more Were stained with blood from many a pilgrim 's feet .</p>
    <p n="278">‘ Then , where , through distant ages , long in pride The palace of the monarch-slave had mocked Famine 's faint groan , and Penury 's silent tear , 95 A heap of crumbling ruins stood , and threw Year after year their stones upon the field , Wakening a lonely echo ; and the leaves Of the old thorn , that on the topmost tower Usurped the royal ensign 's grandeur , shook 100 In the stern storm that swayed the topmost tower And whispered strange tales in the Whirlwind 's ear . ‘ Low through the lone cathedral 's roofless aisles The melancholy winds a death-dirge sung : It were a sight of awfulness to see 105 The works of faith and slavery , so vast , So sumptuous , yet so perishing withal ! Even as the corpse that rests beneath its wall . A thousand mourners deck the pomp of death To-day , the breathing marble glows above 110 To decorate its memory , and tongues Are busy of its life : to-morrow , worms In silence and in darkness seize their prey .</p>
    <p n="279">‘ Within the massy prison 's mouldering courts , Fearless and free the ruddy children played , 115 Weaving gay chaplets for their innocent brows With the green ivy and the red wallflower , That mock the dungeon 's unavailing gloom ; The ponderous chains , and gratings of strong iron , There rusted amid heaps of broken stone 120 That mingled slowly with their native earth : There the broad beam of day , which feebly once Lighted the cheek of lean Captivity With a pale and sickly glare , then freely shone On the pure smiles of infant playfulness : 125 No more the shuddering voice of hoarse Despair Pealed through the echoing vaults , but soothing notes Of ivy-fingered winds and gladsome birds And merriment were resonant around .</p>
    <p n="280">‘ These ruins soon left not a wreck behind : 130 Their elements , wide scattered o'er the globe , To happier shapes were moulded , and became Ministrant to all blissful impulses : Thus human things were perfected , and earth , Even as a child beneath its mother 's love , 135 Was strengthened in all excellence , and grew Fairer and nobler with each passing year .</p>
    <p n="281">‘ Now Time his dusky pennons o'er the scene Closes in steadfast darkness , and the past Fades from our charmed sight . My task is done : 140 Thy lore is learned . Earth 's wonders are thine own , With all the fear and all the hope they bring . My spells are passed : the present now recurs . Ah me ! a pathless wilderness remains Yet unsubdued by man 's reclaiming hand . 145</p>
    <p n="282">‘ Yet , human Spirit , bravely hold thy course , Let virtue teach thee firmly to pursue The gradual paths of an aspiring change : For birth and life and death , and that strange state Before the naked soul has found its home , 150 All tend to perfect happiness , and urge The restless wheels of being on their way , Whose flashing spokes , instinct with infinite life , Bicker and burn to gain their destined goal : For birth but wakes the spirit to the sense 155 Of outward shows , whose unexperienced shape New modes of passion to its frame may lend ; Life is its state of action , and the store Of all events is aggregated there That variegate the eternal universe ; 160 Death is a gate of dreariness and gloom , That leads to azure isles and beaming skies And happy regions of eternal hope . Therefore , O Spirit ! fearlessly bear on : Though storms may break the primrose on its stalk , 165 Though frosts may blight the freshness of its bloom , Yet Spring 's awakening breath will woo the earth , To feed with kindliest dews its favourite flower , That blooms in mossy banks and darksome glens , Lighting the greenwood with its sunny smile . 170</p>
    <p n="283">‘ Fear not then , Spirit , Death 's disrobing hand , So welcome when the tyrant is awake , So welcome when the bigot 's hell-torch burns ; ‘ Tis but the voyage of a darksome hour , The transient gulf-dream of a startling sleep . 175 Death is no foe to Virtue : earth has seen Love 's brightest roses on the scaffold bloom , Mingling with Freedom 's fadeless laurels there , And presaging the truth of visioned bliss . Are there not hopes within thee , which this scene 180 Of linked and gradual being has confirmed ? Whose stingings bade thy heart look further still , When , to the moonlight walk by Henry led , Sweetly and sadly thou didst talk of death ? And wilt thou rudely tear them from thy breast , 185 Listening supinely to a bigot 's creed , Or tamely crouching to the tyrant 's rod , Whose iron thongs are red with human gore ? Never : but bravely bearing on , thy will Is destined an eternal war to wage 190 With tyranny and falsehood , and uproot The germs of misery from the human heart . Thine is the hand whose piety would soothe The thorny pillow of unhappy crime , Whose impotence an easy pardon gains , 195 Watching its wanderings as a friend 's disease : Thine is the brow whose mildness would defy Its fiercest rage , and brave its sternest will , When fenced by power and master of the world . Thou art sincere and good ; of resolute mind , 200 Free from heart-withering custom 's cold control , Of passion lofty , pure and unsubdued . Earth 's pride and meanness could not vanquish thee , And therefore art thou worthy of the boon Which thou hast now received : Virtue shall keep 205 Thy footsteps in the path that thou hast trod , And many days of beaming hope shall bless Thy spotless life of sweet and sacred love . Go , happy one , and give that bosom joy Whose sleepless spirit waits to catch 210 Light , life and rapture from thy smile . ’</p>
    <p n="284">The Fairy waves her wand of charm . Speechless with bliss the Spirit mounts the car , That rolled beside the battlement , Bending her beamy eyes in thankful ness . 215 Again the enchanted steeds were yoked , Again the burning wheels inflame The steep descent of Heaven 's untrodden way . Fast and far the chariot flew : The vast and fiery globes that rolled 220 Around the Fairy 's palace-gate Lessened by slow degrees and soon appeared Such tiny twinklers as the planet orbs That there attendant on the solar power With borrowed light pursued their narrower way . 225</p>
    <p n="285">Earth floated then below : The chariot paused a moment there ; The Spirit then descended : The restless coursers pawed the ungenial soil , Snuffed the gross air , and then , their errand done , 230 Unfurled their pinions to the winds of Heaven .</p>
    <p n="286">The Body and the Soul united then , A gentle start convulsed Ianthe 's frame : Her veiny eyelids quietly unclosed ; Moveless awhile the dark blue orbs remained : 235 She looked around in wonder and beheld Henry , who kneeled in silence by her couch , Watching her sleep with looks of speechless love , And the bright beaming stars That through the casement shone . 240</p>

    <p n="290">The sun 's unclouded orb Rolled through the black concave .</p>
    <p n="291">Beyond our atmosphere the sun would appear a rayless orb of fire in the midst of a black concave . The equal diffusion of its light on earth is owing to the refraction of the rays by the atmosphere , and their reflection from other bodies . Light consists either of vibrations propagated through a subtle medium , or of numerous minute particles repelled in all directions from the luminous body . Its velocity greatly exceeds that of any substance with which we are acquainted : observations on the eclipses of Jupiter 's satellites have demonstrated that light takes up no more than 8 minutes 7 seconds in passing from the sun to the earth , a distance of 95 , 000 , 000 miles .— Some idea may be gained of the immense distance of the fixed stars when it is computed that many years would elapse before light could reach this earth from the nearest of them ; yet in one year light travels 5 , 422 , 400 , 000 , 000 miles , which is a distance 5 , 707 , 600 times greater than that of the sun from the earth .</p>
    <p n="292">1 . 252 , 253 :—</p>
    <p n="293">Whilst round the chariot 's way Innumerable systems rolled .</p>
    <p n="294">The plurality of worlds ,— the indefinite immensity of the universe , is a most awful subject of contemplation . He who rightly feels its mystery and grandeur is in no danger of seduction from the falsehoods of religious systems , or of deifying the principle of the universe . It is impossible to believe that the Spirit that pervades this infinite machine begat a son upon the body of a Jewish woman ; or is angered at the consequences of that necessity , which is a synonym of itself . All that miserable tale of the Devil , and Eve , and an Intercessor , with the childish mummeries of the God of the Jews , is irreconcilable with the knowledge of the stars . The works of His fingers have borne witness against Him .</p>
    <p n="295">The nearest of the fixed stars is inconceivably distant from the earth , and they are probably proportionably distant from each other . By a calculation of the velocity of light , Sirius is supposed to be at least 54 , 224 , 000 , 000 , 000 miles from the earth . ( See Nicholson 's “ Encyclopedia ” , article Light . ) That which appears only like a thin and silvery cloud streaking the heaven is in effect composed of innumerable clusters of suns , each shining with its own light , and illuminating numbers of planets that revolve around them . Millions and millions of suns are ranged around us , all attended by innumerable worlds , yet calm , regular , and harmonious , all keeping the paths of immutable necessity .</p>
    <p n="296">4 . 178 , 179 :—</p>
    <p n="297">These are the hired bravos who defend The tyrant 's throne .</p>
    <p n="298">To employ murder as a means of justice is an idea which a man of an enlightened mind will not dwell upon with pleasure . To march forth in rank and file , and all the pomp of streamers and trumpets , for the purpose of shooting at our fellow-men as a mark ; to inflict upon them all the variety of wound and anguish ; to leave them weltering in their blood ; to wander over the field of desolation , and count the number of the dying and the dead ,— are employments which in thesis we may maintain to be necessary , but which no good man will contemplate with gratulation and delight . A battle we suppose is won :— thus truth is established , thus the cause of justice is confirmed ! It surely requires no common sagacity to discern the connexion between this immense heap of calamities and the assertion of truth or the maintenance of justice .</p>
    <p n="299">‘ Kings , and ministers of state , the real authors of the calamity , sit unmolested in their cabinet , while those against whom the fury of the storm is directed are , for the most part , persons who have been trepanned into the service , or who are dragged unwillingly from their peaceful homes into the field of battle . A soldier is a man whose business it is to kill those who never offended him , and who are the innocent martyrs of other men 's iniquities . Whatever may become of the abstract question of the justifiableness of war , it seems impossible that the soldier should not be a depraved and unnatural being .</p>
    <p n="300">To these more serious and momentous considerations it may be proper to add a recollection of the ridiculousness of the military character . Its first constituent is obedience : a soldier is , of all descriptions of men , the most completely a machine ; yet his profession inevitably teaches him something of dogmatism , swaggering , and sell-consequence : he is like the puppet of a showman , who , at the very time he is made to strut and swell and display the most farcical airs , we perfectly know cannot assume the most insignificant gesture , advance either to the right or the left , but as he is moved by his exhibitor . ’ — Godwin 's “ Enquirer ” , Essay 5 .</p>
    <p n="301">I will here subjoin a little poem , so strongly expressive of my abhorrence of despotism and falsehood , that I fear lest it never again may be depictured so vividly . This opportunity is perhaps the only one that ever will occur of rescuing it from oblivion .</p>
    <p n="302">FALSEHOOD AND VICE .</p>
    <p n="303">A DIALOGUE .</p>
    <p n="304">Whilst monarchs laughed upon their thrones To hear a famished nation 's groans , And hugged the wealth wrung from the woe That makes its eyes and veins o'erflow ,— Those thrones , high built upon the heaps Of bones where frenzied Famine sleeps , Where Slavery wields her scourge of iron , Red with mankind 's unheeded gore , And War 's mad fiends the scene environ , Mingling with shrieks a drunken roar , There Vice and Falsehood took their stand , High raised above the unhappy land .</p>
    <p n="305">FALSEHOOD : Brother ! arise from the dainty fare , Which thousands have toiled and bled to bestow ; A finer feast for thy hungry ear Is the news that I bring of human woe .</p>
    <p n="306">VICE : And , secret one , what hast thou done , To compare , in thy tumid pride , with me ? I , whose career , through the blasted year , Has been tracked by despair and agony .</p>
    <p n="307">FALSEHOOD : What have I done !— I have torn the robe From baby Truth 's unsheltered form , And round the desolated globe Borne safely the bewildering charm : My tyrant-slaves to a dungeon-floor Have bound the fearless innocent , And streams of fertilizing gore Flow from her bosom 's hideous rent , Which this unfailing dagger gave ... I dread that blood !— no more — this day Is ours , though her eternal ray Must shine upon our grave . Yet know , proud Vice , had I not given To thee the robe I stole from Heaven , Thy shape of ugliness and fear Had never gained admission here .</p>
    <p n="308">VICE : And know , that had I disdained to toil , But sate in my loathsome cave the while , And ne'er to these hateful sons of Heaven , GOLD , MONARCHY , and MURDER , given ; Hadst thou with all thine art essayed One of thy games then to have played , With all thine overweening boast , Falsehood ! I tell thee thou hadst lost !— Yet wherefore this dispute ?— we tend , Fraternal , to one common end ; In this cold grave beneath my feet , Will our hopes , our fears , and our labours , meet .</p>
    <p n="309">FALSEHOOD : I brought my daughter , RELIGION , on earth : She smothered Reason 's babes in their birth ; But dreaded their mother 's eye severe ,— So the crocodile slunk off slily in fear , And loosed her bloodhounds from the den .... They started from dreams of slaughtered men , And , by the light of her poison eye , Did her work o'er the wide earth frightfully : The dreadful stench of her torches ’ flare , Fed with human fat , polluted the air : The curses , the shrieks , the ceaseless cries Of the many-mingling miseries , As on she trod , ascended high And trumpeted my victory !— Brother , tell what thou hast done .</p>
    <p n="310">VICE : I have extinguished the noonday sun , In the carnage-smoke of battles won : Famine , Murder , Hell and Power Were glutted in that glorious hour Which searchless fate had stamped for me With the seal of her security ... For the bloated wretch on yonder throne Commanded the bloody fray to rise . Like me he joyed at the stifled moan Wrung from a nation 's miseries ; While the snakes , whose slime even him DEFILED , In ecstasies of malice smiled : They thought ‘ twas theirs ,— but mine the deed ! Theirs is the toil , but mine the meed — Ten thousand victims madly bleed . They dream that tyrants goad them there With poisonous war to taint the air : These tyrants , on their beds of thorn , Swell with the thoughts of murderous fame , And with their gains to lift my name Restless they plan from night to morn : I — I do all ; without my aid Thy daughter , that relentless maid , Could never o'er a death-bed urge The fury of her venomed scourge .</p>
    <p n="311">FALSEHOOD : Brother , well :— the world is ours ; And whether thou or I have won , The pestilence expectant lowers On all beneath yon blasted sun . Our joys , our toils , our honours meet In the milk-white and wormy winding-sheet : A short-lived hope , unceasing care , Some heartless scraps of godly prayer , A moody curse , and a frenzied sleep Ere gapes the grave 's unclosing deep , A tyrant 's dream , a coward 's start , The ice that clings to a priestly heart , A judge 's frown , a courtier 's smile , Make the great whole for which we toil ; And , brother , whether thou or I Have done the work of misery , It little boots : thy toil and pain , Without my aid , were more than vain ; And but for thee I ne'er had sate The guardian of Heaven 's palace gate .</p>

    <p n="323">And statesmen boast Of wealth !</p>
    <p n="324">There is no real wealth but the labour of man . Were the mountains of gold and the valleys of silver , the world would not be one grain of corn the richer ; no one comfort would be added to the human race . In consequence of our consideration for the precious metals , one man is enabled to heap to himself luxuries at the expense of the necessaries of his neighbour ; a system admirably fitted to produce all the varieties of disease and crime , which never fail to characterize the two extremes of opulence and penury . A speculator takes pride to himself as the promoter of his country 's prosperity , who employs a number of hands in the manufacture of articles avowedly destitute of use , or subservient only to the unhallowed cravings of luxury and ostentation . The nobleman , who employs the peasants of his neighbourhood in building his palaces , until ‘ jam pauca aratro jugera regiae moles relinquunt , ’ flatters himself that he has gained the title of a patriot by yielding to the impulses of vanity . The show and pomp of courts adduce the same apology for its continuance ; and many a fete has been given , many a woman has eclipsed her beauty by her dress , to benefit the labouring poor and to encourage trade . Who does not see that this is a remedy which aggravates whilst it palliates the countless diseases of society ? The poor are set to labour ,— for what ? Not the food for which they famish : not the blankets for want of which their babes are frozen by the cold of their miserable hovels : not those comforts of civilization without which civilized man is far more miserable than the meanest savage ; oppressed as he is by all its insidious evils , within the daily and taunting prospect of its innumerable benefits assiduously exhibited before him :— no ; for the pride of power , for the miserable isolation of pride , for the false pleasures of the hundredth part of society . No greater evidence is afforded of the wide extended and radical mistakes of civilized man than this fact : those arts which are essential to his very being are held in the greatest contempt ; employments are lucrative in an inverse ratio to their usefulness ( See Rousseau , “ De l'Inegalite parmi les Hommes ” , note 7 . ): the jeweller , the toyman , the actor gains fame and wealth by the exercise of his useless and ridiculous art ; whilst the cultivator of the earth , he without whom society must cease to subsist , struggles through contempt and penury , and perishes by that famine which but for his unceasing exertions would annihilate the rest of mankind .</p>
    <p n="325">I will not insult common sense by insisting on the doctrine of the natural equality of man . The question is not concerning its desirableness , but its practicability : so far as it is practicable , it is desirable . That state of human society which approaches nearer to an equal partition of its benefits and evils should , caeteris paribus , be preferred : but so long as we conceive that a wanton expenditure of human labour , not for the necessities , not even for the luxuries of the mass of society , but for the egotism and ostentation of a few of its members , is defensible on the ground of public justice , so long we neglect to approximate to the redemption of the human race .</p>
    <p n="326">Labour is required for physical , and leisure for moral improvement : from the former of these advantages the rich , and from the latter the poor , by the inevitable conditions of their respective situations , are precluded . A state which should combine the advantages of both would be subjected to the evils of neither . He that is deficient in firm health , or vigorous intellect , is but half a man : hence it follows that to subject the labouring classes to unnecessary labour is wantonly depriving them of any opportunities of intellectual improvement ; and that the rich are heaping up for their own mischief the disease , lassitude , and ennui by which their existence is rendered an intolerable burthen .</p>
    <p n="327">English reformers exclaim against sinecures ,— but the true pension list is the rent-roll of the landed proprietors : wealth is a power usurped by the few , to compel the many to labour for their benefit . The laws which support this system derive their force from the ignorance and credulity of its victims : they are the result of a conspiracy of the few against the many , who are themselves obliged to purchase this pre-eminence by the loss of all real comfort .</p>
    <p n="328">‘ The commodities that substantially contribute to the subsistence of the human species form a very short catalogue : they demand from us but a slender portion of industry . If these only were produced , and sufficiently produced , the species of man would be continued . If the labour necessarily required to produce them were equitably divided among the poor , and , still more , if it were equitably divided among all , each man 's share of labour would be light , and his portion of leisure would be ample . There was a time when this leisure would have been of small comparative value : it is to be hoped that the time will come when it will be applied to the most important purposes . Those hours which are not required for the production of the necessaries of life may be devoted to the cultivation of the understanding , the enlarging our stock of knowledge , the refining our taste , and thus opening to us new and more exquisite sources of enjoyment .</p>

    <p n="330">‘ It was perhaps necessary that a period of monopoly and oppression should subsist , before a period of cultivated equality could subsist .

    <p n="337">Even love is sold .</p>
    <p n="338">Not even the intercourse of the sexes is exempt from the despotism of positive institution . Law pretends even to govern the indisciplinable wanderings of passion , to put fetters on the clearest deductions of reason , and , by appeals to the will , to subdue the involuntary affections of our nature . Love is inevitably consequent upon the perception of loveliness . Love withers under constraint : its very essence is liberty : it is compatible neither with obedience , jealousy , nor fear : it is there most pure , perfect , and unlimited , where its votaries live in confidence , equality , and unreserve .</p>
    <p n="339">How long then ought the sexual connection to last ? what law ought to specify the extent of the grievances which should limit its duration ? A husband and wife ought to continue so long united as they love each other : any law which should bind them to cohabitation for one moment after the decay of their affection would be a most intolerable tyranny , and the most unworthy of toleration . How odious an usurpation of the right of private judgement should that law be considered which should make the ties of friendship indissoluble , in spite of the caprices , the inconstancy , the fallibility , and capacity for improvement of the human mind . And by so much would the fetters of love be heavier and more unendurable than those of friendship , as love is more vehement and capricious , more dependent on those delicate peculiarities of imagination , and less capable of reduction to the ostensible merits of the object .</p>
    <p n="340">The state of society in which we exist is a mixture of feudal savageness and imperfect civilization . The narrow and unenlightened morality of the Christian religion is an aggravation of these evils . It is not even until lately that mankind have admitted that happiness is the sole end of the science of ethics , as of all other sciences ; and that the fanatical idea of mortifying the flesh for the love of God has been discarded . I have heard , indeed , an ignorant collegian adduce , in favour of Christianity , its hostility to every worldly feeling ! ( The first Christian emperor made a law by which seduction was punished with death ; if the female pleaded her own consent , she also was punished with death ; if the parents endeavoured to screen the criminals , they were banished and their estates were confiscated ; the slaves who might be accessory were burned alive , or forced to swallow melted lead . The very offspring of an illegal love were involved in the consequences of the sentence .— Gibbon 's “ Decline and Fall ” , etc ., volume 2 , page 210 . See also , for the hatred of the primitive Christians to love and even marriage , page 269 . )</p>
    <p n="341">But if happiness be the object of morality , of all human unions and disunions ; if the worthiness of every action is to be estimated by the quantity of pleasurable sensation it is calculated to produce , then the connection of the sexes is so long sacred as it contributes to the comfort of the parties , and is naturally dissolved when its evils are greater than its benefits . There is nothing immoral in this separation . Constancy has nothing virtuous in itself , independently of the pleasure it confers , and partakes of the temporizing spirit of vice in proportion as it endures tamely moral defects of magnitude in the object of its indiscreet choice . Love is free : to promise for ever to love the same woman is not less absurd than to promise to believe the same creed : such a vow , in both cases , excludes us from all inquiry . The language of the votarist is this : The woman I now love may be infinitely inferior to many others ; the creed I now profess may be a mass of errors and absurdities ; but I exclude myself from all future information as to the amiability of the one and the truth of the other , resolving blindly , and in spite of conviction , to adhere to them . Is this the language of delicacy and reason ? Is the love of such a frigid heart of more worth than its belief ?</p>
    <p n="342">The present system of constraint does no more , in the majority of instances , than make hypocrites or open enemies . Persons of delicacy and virtue , unhappily united to one whom they find it impossible to love , spend the loveliest season of their life in unproductive efforts to appear otherwise than they are , for the sake of the feelings of their partner or the welfare of their mutual offspring : those of less generosity and refinement openly avow their disappointment , and linger out the remnant of that union , which only death can dissolve , in a state of incurable bickering and hostility . The early education of their children takes its colour from the squabbles of the parents ; they are nursed in a systematic school of ill-humour , violence , and falsehood . Had they been suffered to part at the moment when indifference rendered their union irksome , they would have been spared many years of misery : they would have connected themselves more suitably , and would have found that happiness in the society of more congenial partners which is for ever denied them by the despotism of marriage . They would have been separately useful and happy members of society , who , whilst united , were miserable and rendered misanthropical by misery . The conviction that wedlock is indissoluble holds out the strongest of all temptations to the perverse : they indulge without restraint in acrimony , and all the little tyrannies of domestic life , when they know that their victim is without appeal . If this connection were put on a rational basis , each would be assured that habitual ill-temper would terminate in separation , and would check this vicious and dangerous propensity .</p>
    <p n="343">Prostitution is the legitimate offspring of marriage and its accompanying errors . Women , for no other crime than having followed the dictates of a natural appetite , are driven with fury from the comforts and sympathies of society . It is less venial than murder ; and the punishment which is inflicted on her who destroys her child to escape reproach is lighter than the life of agony and disease to which the prostitute is irrecoverably doomed . Has a woman obeyed the impulse of unerring nature ;— society declares war against her , pitiless and eternal war : she must be the tame slave , she must make no reprisals ; theirs is the right of persecution , hers the duty of endurance . She lives a life of infamy : the loud and bitter laugh of scorn scares her from all return . She dies of long and lingering disease : yet SHE is in fault , SHE is the criminal , SHE the froward and untamable child ,— and society , forsooth , the pure and virtuous matron , who casts her as an abortion from her undefiled bosom ! Society avenges herself on the criminals of her own creation ; she is employed in anathematizing the vice to-day , which yesterday she was the most zealous to teach . Thus is formed one-tenth of the population of London : meanwhile the evil is twofold . Young men , excluded by the fanatical idea of chastity from the society of modest and accomplished women , associate with these vicious and miserable beings , destroying thereby all those exquisite and delicate sensibilities whose existence cold-hearted worldlings have denied ; annihilating all genuine passion , and debasing that to a selfish feeling which is the excess of generosity and devotedness . Their body and mind alike crumble into a hideous wreck of humanity ; idiocy and disease become perpetuated in their miserable offspring , and distant generations suffer for the bigoted morality of their forefathers . Chastity is a monkish and evangelical superstition , a greater foe to natural temperance even than unintellectual sensuality ; it strikes at the root of all domestic happiness , and consigns more than half of the human race to misery , that some few may monopolize according to law . A system could not well have been devised more studiously hostile to human happiness than marriage .</p>
    <p n="344">I conceive that from the abolition of marriage , the fit and natural arrangement of sexual connection would result . I by no means assert that the intercourse would be promiscuous : on the contrary , it appears , from the relation of parent to child , that this union is generally of long duration , and marked above all others with generosity and self-devotion . But this is a subject which it is perhaps premature to discuss . That which will result from the abolition of marriage will be natural and right ; because choice and change will be exempted from restraint .</p>
    <p n="345">In fact , religion and morality , as they now stand , compose a practical code of misery and servitude : the genius of human happiness must tear every leaf from the accursed book of God ere man can read the inscription on his heart . How would morality , dressed up in stiff stays and finery , start from her own disgusting image should she look in the mirror of nature !—</p>

It is exceedingly probable , from many considerations , that this obliquity will gradually diminish , until the equator coincides with the ecliptic : the nights and days will then become equal on the earth throughout the year , and probably the seasons also . There is no great extravagance in presuming that the progress of the perpendicularity of the poles may be as rapid as the progress of intellect ; or that there should be a perfect identity between the moral and physical improvement of the human species . It is certain that wisdom is not compatible with disease , and that , in the present state of the climates of the earth , health , in the true and comprehensive sense of the word , is out of the reach of civilized man . Astronomy teaches us that the earth is now in its progress , and that the poles are every year becoming more and more perpendicular to the ecliptic . The strong evidence afforded by the history of mythology , and geological researches , that some event of this nature has taken place already , affords a strong presumption that this progress is not merely an oscillation , as has been surmised by some late astronomers .

    <p n="355">Necessity ! thou mother of the world !</p>
    <p n="356">He who asserts the doctrine of Necessity means that , contemplating the events which compose the moral and material universe , he beholds only an immense and uninterrupted chain of causes and effects , no one of which could occupy any other place than it does occupy , or act in any other place than it does act . The idea of necessity is obtained by our experience of the connection between objects , the uniformity of the operations of nature , the constant conjunction of similar events , and the consequent inference of one from the other . Mankind are therefore agreed in the admission of necessity , if they admit that these two circumstances take place in voluntary action . Motive is to voluntary action in the human mind what cause is to effect in the material universe . The word liberty , as applied to mind , is analogous to the word chance as applied to matter : they spring from an ignorance of the certainty of the conjunction of antecedents and consequents .</p>
    <p n="357">Every human being is irresistibly impelled to act precisely as he does act : in the eternity which preceded his birth a chain of causes was generated , which , operating under the name of motives , make it impossible that any thought of his mind , or any action of his life , should be otherwise than it is . Were the doctrine of Necessity false , the human mind would no longer be a legitimate object of science ; from like causes it would be in vain that we should expect like effects ; the strongest motive would no longer be paramount over the conduct ; all knowledge would be vague and undeterminate ; we could not predict with any certainty that we might not meet as an enemy to-morrow him with whom we have parted in friendship to-night ; the most probable inducements and the clearest reasonings would lose the invariable influence they possess . The contrary of this is demonstrably the fact . Similar circumstances produce the same unvariable effects . The precise character and motives of any man on any occasion being given , the moral philosopher could predict his actions with as much certainty as the natural philosopher could predict the effects of the mixture of any particular chemical substances . Why is the aged husbandman more experienced than the young beginner ? Because there is a uniform , undeniable necessity in the operations of the material universe . Why is the old statesman more skilful than the raw politician ) Because , relying on the necessary conjunction of motive and action , he proceeds to produce moral effects , by the application of those moral causes which experience has shown to be effectual . Some actions may be found to which we can attach no motives , but these are the effects of causes with which we are unacquainted . Hence the relation which motive bears to voluntary action is that of cause to effect ; nor , placed in this point of view , is it , or ever has it been , the subject of popular or philosophical dispute . None but the few fanatics who are engaged in the herculean task of reconciling the justice of their God with the misery of man , will longer outrage common sense by the supposition of an event without a cause , a voluntary action without a motive . History , politics , morals , criticism , all grounds of reasonings , all principles of science , alike assume the truth of the doctrine of Necessity . No farmer carrying his corn to market doubts the sale of it at the market price . The master of a manufactory no more doubts that he can purchase the human labour necessary for his purposes than that his machinery will act as they have been accustomed to act .</p>
    <p n="358">But , whilst none have scrupled to admit necessity as influencing matter , many have disputed its dominion over mind . Independently of its militating with the received ideas of the justice of God , it is by no means obvious to a superficial inquiry . When the mind observes its own operations , it feels no connection of motive and action : but as we know ‘ nothing more of causation than the constant conjunction of objects and the consequent inference of one from the other , as we find that these two circumstances are universally allowed to have place in voluntary action , we may be easily led to own that they are subjected to the necessity common to all causes . ’ The actions of the will have a regular conjunction with circumstances and characters ; motive is to voluntary action what cause is to effect . But the only idea we can form of causation is a constant conjunction of similar objects , and the consequent inference of one from the other : wherever this is the case necessity is clearly established .</p>
    <p n="359">The idea of liberty , applied metaphorically to the will , has sprung from a misconception of the meaning of the word power . What is power ?— id quod potest , that which can produce any given effect . To deny power is to say that nothing can or has the power to be or act . In the only true sense of the word power , it applies with equal force to the lodestone as to the human will . Do you think these motives , which I shall present , are powerful enough to rouse him ? is a question just as common as , Do you think this lever has the power of raising this weight ? The advocates of free-will assert that the will has the power of refusing to be determined by the strongest motive ; but the strongest motive is that which , overcoming all others , ultimately prevails ; this assertion therefore amounts to a denial of the will being ultimately determined by that motive which does determine it , which is absurd . But it is equally certain that a man cannot resist the strongest motive as that he cannot overcome a physical impossibility .</p>
    <p n="360">The doctrine of Necessity tends to introduce a great change into the established notions of morality , and utterly to destroy religion . Reward and punishment must be considered , by the Necessarian , merely as motives which he would employ in order to procure the adoption or abandonment of any given line of conduct . Desert , in the present sense of the word , would no longer have any meaning ; and he who should inflict pain upon another for no better reason than that he deserved it , would only gratify his revenge under pretence of satisfying justice ? It is not enough , says the advocate of free-will , that a criminal should be prevented from a repetition of his crime : he should feel pain , and his torments , when justly inflicted , ought precisely to be proportioned to his fault . But utility is morality ; that which is incapable of producing happiness is useless ; and though the crime of Damiens must be condemned , yet the frightful torments which revenge , under the name of justice , inflicted on this unhappy man cannot be supposed to have augmented , even at the long run , the stock of pleasurable sensation in the world . At the same time , the doctrine of Necessity does not in the least diminish our disapprobation of vice . The conviction which all feel that a viper is a poisonous animal , and that a tiger is constrained , by the inevitable condition of his existence , to devour men , does not induce us to avoid them lass sedulously , or , even more , to hesitate in destroying them : but he would surely be of a hard heart who , meeting with a serpent on a desert island , or in a situation where it was incapable of injury , should wantonly deprive it of existence . A Necessarian is inconsequent to his own principles if he indulges in hatred or contempt ; the compassion which he feels for the criminal is unmixed with a desire of injuring him : he looks with an elevated and dreadless composure upon the links of the universal chain as they pass before his eyes ; whilst cowardice , curiosity , and inconsistency only assail him in proportion to the feebleness and indistinctness with which he has perceived and rejected the delusions of free-will .</p>
    <p n="361">Religion is the perception of the relation in which we stand to the principle of the universe . But if the principle of the universe be not an organic being , the model and prototype of man , the relation between it and human beings is absolutely none . Without some insight into its will respecting our actions religion is nugatory and vain . But will is only a mode of animal mind ; moral qualities also are such as only a human being can possess ; to attribute them to the principle of the universe is to annex to it properties incompatible with any possible definition of its nature . It is probable that the word God was originally only an expression denoting the unknown cause of the known events which men perceived in the universe . By the vulgar mistake of a metaphor for a real being , of a word for a thing , it became a man , endowed with human qualities and governing the universe as an earthly monarch governs his kingdom . Their addresses to this imaginary being , indeed , are much in the same style as those of subjects to a king . They acknowledge his benevolence , deprecate his anger , and supplicate his favour .</p>
    <p n="362">But the doctrine of Necessity teaches us that in no case could any event have happened otherwise than it did happen , and that , if God is the author of good , He is also the author of evil ; that , if He is entitled to our gratitude for the one , He is entitled to our hatred for the other ; that , admitting the existence of this hypothetic being , He is also subjected to the dominion of an immutable necessity . It is plain that the same arguments which prove that God is the author of food , light , and life , prove Him also to be the author of poison , darkness , and death . The wide-wasting earthquake , the storm , the battle , and the tyranny , are attributable to this hypothetic being in the same degree as the fairest forms of nature , sunshine , liberty , and peace .</p>
    <p n="363">But we are taught , by the doctrine of Necessity , that there is neither good nor evil in the universe , otherwise than as the events to which we apply these epithets have relation to our own peculiar mode of being . Still less than with the hypothesis of a God will the doctrine of Necessity accord with the belief of a future state of punishment . God made man such as he is , and than damned him for being so : for to say that God was the author of all good , and man the author of all evil , is to say that one man made a straight line and a crooked one , and another man made the incongruity .</p>
    <p n="364">A Mahometan story , much to the present purpose , is recorded , wherein Adam and Moses are introduced disputing before God in the following manner .

Whereto Adam answered , Thou art Moses , whom God chose for His apostle , and entrusted with His word , by giving thee the tables of the law , and whom He vouchsafed to admit to discourse with Himself . How many years dost thou find the law was written before I was created ? Says Moses , Forty . And dost thou not find , replied Adam , these words therein , And Adam rebelled against his Lord and transgressed ? Which Moses confessing , Dost thou therefore blame me , continued he , for doing that which God wrote of me that I should do , forty years before I was created , nay , for what was decreed concerning me fifty thousand years before the creation of heaven and earth ?— Sale 's “ Prelim .

    <p n="366">There is no God .</p>
    <p n="367">This negation must be understood solely to affect a creative Deity . The hypothesis of a pervading Spirit co-eternal with the universe remains unshaken .</p>
    <p n="368">A close examination of the validity of the proofs adduced to support any proposition is the only secure way of attaining truth , on the advantages of which it is unnecessary to descant : our knowledge of the existence of a Deity is a subject of such importance that it cannot be too minutely investigated ; in consequence of this conviction we proceed briefly and impartially to examine the proofs which have been adduced . It is necessary first to consider the nature of belief .</p>
    <p n="369">When a proposition is offered to the mind , it perceives the agreement or disagreement of the ideas of which it is composed . A perception of their agreement is termed BELIEF . Many obstacles frequently prevent this perception from being immediate ; these the mind attempts to remove in order that the perception may be distinct . The mind is active in the investigation in order to perfect the state of perception of the relation which the component ideas of the proposition bear to each , which is passive : the investigation being confused with the perception has induced many falsely to imagine that the mind is active in belief ,— that belief is an act of volition ,— in consequence of which it may be regulated by the mind . Pursuing , continuing this mistake , they have attached a degree of criminality to disbelief ; of which , in its nature , it is incapable : it is equally incapable of merit .</p>
    <p n="370">Belief , then , is a passion , the strength of which , like every other passion , is in precise proportion to the degrees of excitement .</p>
    <p n="371">The degrees of excitement are three .</p>
    <p n="372">The senses are the sources of all knowledge to the mind ; consequently their evidence claims the strongest assent .</p>
    <p n="373">The decision of the mind , founded upon our own experience , derived from these sources , claims the next degree .</p>
    <p n="374">The experience of others , which addresses itself to the former one , occupies the lowest degree .</p>
    <p n="375">( A graduated scale , on which should be marked the capabilities of propositions to approach to the test of the senses , would be a just barometer of the belief which ought to be attached to them . )</p>
    <p n="376">Consequently no testimony can be admitted which is contrary to reason ; reason is founded on the evidence of our senses .</p>
    <p n="377">Every proof may be referred to one of these three divisions : it is to be considered what arguments we receive from each of them , which should convince us of the existence of a Deity .</p>
    <p n="378">1st , The evidence of the senses . If the Deity should appear to us , if He should convince our senses of His existence , this revelation would necessarily command belief . Those to whom the Deity has thus appeared have the strongest possible conviction of His existence . But the God of Theologians is incapable of local visibility .</p>
    <p n="379">2d , Reason . It is urged that man knows that whatever is must either have had a beginning , or have existed from all eternity : he also knows that whatever is not eternal must have had a cause . When this reasoning is applied to the universe , it is necessary to prove that it was created : until that is clearly demonstrated we may reasonably suppose that it has endured from all eternity . We must prove design before we can infer a designer . The only idea which we can form of causation is derivable from the constant conjunction of objects , and the consequent inference of one from the other . In a case where two propositions are diametrically opposite , the mind believes that which is least incomprehensible ;— it is easier to suppose that the universe has existed from all eternity than to conceive a being beyond its limits capable of creating it : if the mind sinks beneath the weight of one , is it an alleviation to increase the intolerability of the burthen ?</p>
    <p n="380">The other argument , which is founded on a man 's knowledge of his own existence , stands thus . A man knows not only that he now is , but that once he was not ; consequently there must have been a cause . But our idea of causation is alone derivable from the constant conjunction of objects and the consequent inference of one from the other ; and , reasoning experimentally , we can only infer from effects causes exactly adequate to those effects . But there certainly is a generative power which is effected by certain instruments : we cannot prove that it is inherent in these instruments ; nor is the contrary hypothesis capable of demonstration : we admit that the generative power is incomprehensible ; but to suppose that the same effect is produced by an eternal , omniscient , omnipotent being leaves the cause in the same obscurity , but renders it more incomprehensible .</p>
    <p n="381">3d , Testimony . It is required that testimony should not be contrary to reason . The testimony that the Deity convinces the senses of men of His existence can only be admitted by us if our mind considers it less probable that these men should have been deceived than that the Deity should have appeared to them . Our reason can never admit the testimony of men , who not only declare that they were eye-witnesses of miracles , but that the Deity was irrational ; for He commanded that He should be believed , He proposed the highest rewards for faith , eternal punishments for disbelief . We can only command voluntary actions ; belief is not an act of volition ; the mind is even passive , or involuntarily active ; from this it is evident that we have no sufficient testimony , or rather that testimony is insufficient to prove the being of a God . It has been before shown that it cannot be deduced from reason . They alone , then , who have been convinced by the evidence of the senses can believe it .</p>
    <p n="382">Hence it is evident that , having no proofs from either of the three sources of conviction , the mind CANNOT believe the existence of a creative God : it is also evident that , as belief is a passion of the mind , no degree of criminality is attachable to disbelief ; and that they only are reprehensible who neglect to remove the false medium through which their mind views any subject of discussion . Every reflecting mind must acknowledge that there is no proof of the existence of a Deity .</p>
    <p n="383">God is an hypothesis , and , as such , stands in need of proof : the onus probandi rests on the theist . Sir Isaac Newton says : Hypotheses non fingo , quicquid enim ex phaenomenis non deducitur hypothesis vocanda est , et hypothesis vel metaphysicae , vel physicae , vel qualitatum occultarum , seu mechanicae , in philosophia locum non habent . To all proofs of the existence of a creative God apply this valuable rule . We see a variety of bodies possessing a variety of powers : we merely know their effects ; we are in a state of ignorance with respect to their essences and causes . These Newton calls the phenomena of things ; but the pride of philosophy is unwilling to admit its ignorance of their causes . From the phenomena , which are the objects of our senses , we attempt to infer a cause , which we call God , and gratuitously endow it with all negative and contradictory qualities . From this hypothesis we invent this general name , to conceal our ignorance of causes and essences . The being called God by no means answers with the conditions prescribed by Newton ; it bears every mark of a veil woven by philosophical conceit , to hide the ignorance of philosophers even from themselves . They borrow the threads of its texture from the anthropomorphism of the vulgar . Words have been used by sophists for the same purposes , from the occult qualities of the peripatetics to the effluvium of Boyle and the crinities or nebulae of Herschel . God is represented as infinite , eternal , incomprehensible ; He is contained under every predicate in non that the logic of ignorance could fabricate . Even His worshippers allow that it is impossible to form any idea of Him : they exclaim with the French poet ,</p>

    <p n="385">Lord Bacon says that atheism leaves to man reason , philosophy , natural piety , laws , reputation , and everything that can serve to conduct him to virtue ; but superstition destroys all these , and erects itself into a tyranny over the understandings of men : hence atheism never disturbs the government , but renders man more clear-sighted , since he seas nothing beyond the boundaries of the present life .— Bacon 's “ Moral Essays ” .</p>
    <p n="386">La premiere theologie de l'homme lui fit d'abord craindre at adorer les elements meme , des objets materiels at grossiers ; il randit ensuite ses hommages a des agents presidant aux elements , a des genies inferieurs , a des heros , ou a des hommes doues de grandes qualites . A force de reflechir il crut simplifier les choses en soumettant la nature entiere a un seul agent , a un esprit , a una ame universelle , qui mettait cette nature et ses parties en mouvement . En remontant de causes en causes , les mortels ont fini par ne rien voir ; at c'est dans cette obscurite qu'ils ont place leur Dieu ; c'est dans cat abime tenebreux que leur imagination inquiete travaille toujours a se fabriquer des chimeres , qui les affligeront jusqu'a ce que la connaissance da la nature les detrompe des fantomes qu'ils ont toujours si vainement adores .</p>
    <p n="387">Si nous voulons nous rendre compte de nos idees sur la Divinite , nous serons obliges de convanir que , par le mot “ Dieu ” , les hommes n'ont jamais pu designer que la cause la plus cachee , la plus eloignee , la plus inconnue des effets qu'ils voyaient : ils ne font usage de ce mot , que lorsque le jeu des causes naturelles at connues cesse d'etre visible pour eux ; des qu'ils perdent le fil de ces causes , on des que leur esprit ne peut plus en suivre la chaine , ils tranchent leur difficulte , at terminent leurs recherches en appellant Dieu la derniere des causes , c'esthYpppHeNahYpppHeNdire celle qui est au-dela de toutes les causes qu'ils connaissent ; ainsi ils ne font qu'assigner une denomination vague a une cause ignoree , a laquelle leur paresse ou les bornes de leurs connaissances les forcent de s'arreter . Toutes les fois qu'on nous dit que Dieu est l'auteur de quelque phenomene , cela signifie qu'on ignore comment un tel phenomene a pu s'operer par le secours des forces ou des causes que nous connaissons dans la nature . C'est ainsi que le commun des hommes , dont l'ignorance est la partage , attribue a la Divinite non seulement les effets inusites qui las frappent , mais encore les evenemens les plus simples , dont les causes sont les plus faciles a connaitre pour quiconque a pu les mediter . En un mot , l'homme a toujours respecte les causes inconnues des effets surprenans , que son ignorance l'empechait de demeler . Ce fut sur les debris de la nature que les hommes eleverent le colosse imaginaire de la Divinite .</p>
    <p n="388">Si l'ignorance de la nature donna la naissance aux dieux , la connaissance de la nature est faite pour les detruire . A mesure que l'homme s'instruit , ses forces at ses ressources augmentent avec ses lumieres ; les sciences , les arts conservateurs , l'industrie , lui fournissent des secours ; l'experience le rassure ou lui procure des moyens de resister aux efforts de bien des causes qui cessent de l'alarmer des qu'il les a connues . En un mot , ses terreurs se dissipent dans la meme proportion que son esprit s'eclaire . L'homnme instruit cesse d'etre superstitieux .</p>
    <p n="389">Ce n'est jamais que sur parole que des peuples entiers adorent le Dieu de leurs peres at de leurs pretres : l'autorite , la confiance , la soumission , et l'habitude leur tiennent lieu de conviction et de preuves ; ils se prosternent et prient , parce que leurs peres leur out appris a se prosterner at prier : mais pourquoi ceux-ci se sont-ils mis a genoux ? C'est que dans les temps eloignes leurs legislateurs et leurs guides leur en ont fait un devoir . ‘ Adorez at croyez , ’ ont-ils dit , ‘ des dieux que vous ne pouvez comprendre ; rapportez-vous-en a notre sagesse profonde ; nous en savons plus que vous sur la divinite . ’ Mais pourquoi m'en rapporteraishYpppHeNje a vous ? C'est que Dieu le veut ainsi , c'est que Dieu vous punira si vous osez resister . Mais ce Dieu n'esthYpppHeNil donc pas la chose en question ? Cependant las hommes se sont toujours payes de ce cercle vicieux ; la paresse de leur esprit leur fit trouver plus court de s'en rapporter au jugament des autres . Toutes las notions religieuses sent fondees uniquement sur l'autorite ; toutes les religions du monde defendent l'examen et ne veulent pas que l'on raisonne ; c'est l'autorite qui veut qu'on croie en Dieu ; ce Dieu n'est luihYpppHeNmeme fonde que sur l'autorite de quelques hommes qui pretendent le connaitre , et venir de sa part pour l'annoncer a la terre . Un Dieu fait par les hommes a sans doute bosom des hommes pour se faire connaitre aux hommes .</p>
    <p n="390">Ne serait-ce donc que pour des pretres , des inspires , des metaphysiciens que serait reservee la conviction de l'existence d'un Dieu , que l'on dit neanmoins si necessaire a tout le genre humain ? Mais trouvons-nous de l'harmonie entre les opinions theologiques des differens inspires , ou des penseurs repandus sur la terre ? Ceux meme qui font profession d'adorer le meme Dieu , sent-ils d'accord sur son compte ? Sont-ils contents des preuves que leurs collegues apportent de son existence ? Souscrivent-ils unanimement aux idees qu'ils presentent sur sa nature , sur sa conduite , sur la facon d'entendre ses pretandus oracles ? Est-il une centree sur la terre ou la science de Dieu se soit reellement parfectionnee ? A-t-elle pris quelqne part la consistance et l'uniformite que nous voyons prendre aux connaissances humaines , aux arts les plus futiles , aux metiers les plus meprises ? Ces mots d'esprit , d'immaterialite , de creation , de predestination , de grace ; cette foule de distinctions subtiles dont la theologie s'est parteut remplie dans quelques pays , ces inventions si ingenieuses , imaginees par des penseurs qui se sont succedes depuis taut de siecles , n'ont fait , helas ! qu'embrouiller les choses , et jamais la science la plus necassaire aux hommes n'a jusqu'ici pu acquerir la moindre fixite . Depuis des milliers d'annees ces reveurs oisifs se sont perpetuellement relayes pour mediter la Divinite , pour deviner ses voies cachees , pour inventer des hypotheses propres a developper cette enigme importante . Leur peu de succes n'a point decourage la vanite theologique ; toujours on a parle de Dieu : on s'est egorge pour lui , et cet etre sublime demeure toujours le plus ignore et le plus discute .</p>
    <p n="391">Les hommes auraient ete trop heureux , si , se bornant aux objets visibles qui les interessent , ils eussent employe a perfectionner leurs sciences reelles , leurs lois , leur morale , leur education , la moitie des efforts qu'ils ont mis dans leurs recherches sur la Divinite . Ils auraiant ete bien plus sages encore , et plus fortunes , s'ils eussent pu consentir a laisser leurs guides desoeuvres se quereller entre eux , et sonder des profondeurs capables de les etourdir , sans se meler de leurs disputes insensees . Mais il est de l'essence de l'ignorance d'attacher de l'importance a ce qu'elle ne comprend pas . La vanite humaine fait que l'esprit se roidit contra des difficultes . Plus un objet se derobe a nos yeux , plus nous faisons d'efforts pour le saisir , parce que des-lors il aiguillonne notre orgueil , il excite notre curiosite , il nous parait interessant . En combattant pour son Dieu chacun ne combattit en effet que pour les interets de sa propra vanite , qui de toutes les passions produites par la mal-organisation de la societe est la plus prompte a s'alarmer , et la plus propre a produire de tres grandes folies .</p>
    <p n="392">Si ecartant pour un moment les idees facheuses que la theologie nous donne d'un Dieu capriciaux , dont les decrets partiaux et despotiques decident du sort des humains , nous ne voulons fixer nos yeux que sur la bonte pretendue , que tous les hommes , meme en tramblant devant ce Dieu , s'accordent a lui donner ; si nous lui supposons le projet qu'on lui prete de n'avoir travaille que pour sa propre gloire , d'exiger les hommages des etres intelligens ; de ne chercher dans ses oeuvres que le bien-etre du genre humain : comment concilier ces vues et ces dispositions avec l'ignorance vraiment invincible dans laquelle ce Dieu , si glorieux et si bon , laisse la plupart des hommes sur son compte ? Si Dieu veut etre connu , cheri , remercie , que ne se montre-t-il sous des traits favorables a tous ces etres intelligens dont il veut etre aime et adore ? Pourquoi ne point se manifester a toute la terre dune facon non equivoque , bien plus capable de nous convaincre que ces revelations particulieres qui semblent accuser la Divinite d'une partialite facheuse pour quelques-unes de ses creatures ? La tout-puissant n'auroithYpppHeNil donc pas des moyens plus convainquans de se montrer aux hommas que ces metamorphoses ridicules , cas incarnations pretendues , qui nous sont attestees par des ecrivains si peu d'accord entre eux dans les recits qu'ils en font ? Au lieu de tant de miracles , inventes pour prouver la mission divine de tant de legislateurs reveres par les differens peuples du monde , le souverain des esprits ne pouvait-il pas convaincre tout d'un coup l'esprit humain des choses qu'il a voulu lui faire connaitre ? Au lieu de suspendre un soleil dans la voute du firmament ; au lieu de repandre sans ordre les etoiles et les constellations qui remplissent l'espace , n'euthYpppHeNil pas ete plus conforme aux vues d'un Dieu si jaloux de sa gloire et si bien-intentionne pour l'homme d'ecrire , d'une facon non sujette a dispute , son nom , ses attributs , ses volontes permanentes en caracteres ineffacables , et lisibles egalement pour tous les habitants de la terre ? Personne alors n'aurait pu douter de l'existence d'un Dieu , de ses volontes claires , de ses intentions visibles . Sous les yeux de ce Dieu si terrible , personne n'aurait eu l'audace de violer ses ordonnances ; nul mortel n'eut ose se mettre dans le cas d'attirer sa colere : enfin nul homme n'eut eu le front d'en imposer en son nom , ou d'interpreter ses volontes suivant ses propres fantaisies .</p>
    <p n="393">En effet , quand meme on admettrait l'existence du Dieu theologique et la realite des attributs si discordans qu'on lui donne , l'on n'en peut rien conclure , pour autoriser la conduite ou les cultes qu'on prescrit de lui rendre . La theologie est vraiment “ le tonneau des Danaides ” . A force de qualites contradictoires et d'assartions hasardees , ella a , pour ainsi dire , tellement garrotte son Dieu qu'elle l'a mis dans l'impossibilite d'agir . S'il est infiniment bon , quelle raison aurions-nous de le craindre ? S'il est infiniment sage , de quoi nous inquieter sur notre sort ? S'il sait tout , pourquoi l'avertir de nos besoins , et le fatiguer de nos prieres ? S'il est partout , pourquoi lui elever des temples ? S'il est maitre de tout , pourquoi lui faire des sacrifices et des offrandes ? S'il est juste , comment croire qu'il punisse des creatures qu'il a rempli de faiblesses ? Si la grace fait tout en elles , quelle raison aurait-il de les recompenser ? S'il est tout-puissant , comment l'offenser , comment lui resister ? S'il est raisonnable , comment se mattrait-il en colere contre des aveugles , a qui il a laisse la liberte de deraisonner ? S'il est immuable , de quel droit pretendrions-nous faire changer ses decrets ? S'il est inconcevable , pourquoi nous en occuper ? S'IL A PARLE , POURQUOI L'UNIVERS N'ESThYpppHeNIL PAS CONVAINCU ? Si la connaissance d'un Dieu est la plus necessaire , pourquoi n'esthYpppHeNelle pas la plus evidente et a plus claire ?— “ Systeme de la Nature ” , London , 1781 .</p>
    <p n="394">The enlightened and benevolent Pliny thus publicly professes himself an atheist :— Quapropter effigiem Dei formamque quaerere imbecillitatis humanae reor . Quisquis est Deus ( si modo est alius ) et quacunque in parte , totus est sensus , totus est visus , totus auditus , totus animae , totus animi , totus sui ... Imperfectae vero in homine naturae praecipua solatia ne deum quidem posse omnia . Namque nec sibi potest mortem consciscere , si velit , quad homini dedit optimum in tantis vitae poenis : nec mortales aeternitata donare , aut revocare defunctos ; nec facere ut qui vixit non vixerit , qui honores gessit non gessarit , nullumque habere in praeteritum ius , praeterquam oblivionis , atque ( ut facetis quoque argumentis societas haec cum deo copuletur ) ut bis dena viginti non sint , et multa similiter efficere non posse .— Per quae declaratur haud dubie naturae potentiam id quoque esse quad Deum vocamus .— Plin . “ Nat . Hist . ” cap . de Deo .</p>
    <p n="395">The consistent Newtonian is necessarily an atheist . See Sir W. Drummond 's “ Academical Questions ” , chapter 3 .— Sir W. seems to consider the atheism to which it leads as a sufficient presumption of the falsehood of the system of gravitation ; but surely it is more consistent with the good faith of philosophy to admit a deduction from facts than an hypothesis incapable of proof , although it might militate with the obstinate preconceptions of the mob . Had this author , instead of inveighing against the guilt and absurdity of atheism , demonstrated its falsehood , his conduct would have been more suited to the modesty of the sceptic and the toleration of the philosopher .</p>

    <p n="398">Ahasuerus , rise !</p>
    <p n="399">‘ Ahasuerus the Jew crept forth from the dark cave of Mount Carmel . Near two thousand years have elapsed since he was first goaded by never-ending restlessness to rove the globe from pole to pole . When our Lord was wearied with the burthen of His ponderous cross , and wanted to rest before the door of Ahasuerus , the unfeeling wretch drove Him away with brutality . The Saviour of mankind staggered , sinking under the heavy load , but uttered no complaint . An angel of death appeared before Ahasuerus , and exclaimed indignantly , “ Barbarian ! thou hast denied rest to the Son of man : be it denied thee also , until He comes to judge the world . ”</p>
    <p n="400">‘ A black demon , let loose from hell upon Ahasuerus , goads him now from country to country ; he is denied the consolation which death affords , and precluded from the rest of the peaceful grave .</p>
    <p n="401">‘ Ahasuerus crept forth from the dark cave of Mount Carmel — he shook the dust from his beard — and taking up one of the skulls heaped there , hurled it down the eminence : it rebounded from the earth in shivered atoms . “ This was my father ! ” roared Ahasuerus . Seven more skulls rolled down from rock to rock ; while the infuriate Jew , following them with ghastly looks , exclaimed — “ And these were my wives ! ” He still continued to hurl down skull after skull , roaring in dreadful accents — “ And these , and these , and these were my children ! They COULD DIE ; but I ! reprobate wretch ! alas ! I cannot die ! Dreadful beyond conception is the judgement that hangs over me . Jerusalem fell — I crushed the sucking babe , and precipitated myself into the destructive flames . I cursed the Romans — but , alas ! alas ! the restless curse held me by the hair ,— and I could not die !</p>
    <p n="402">‘ " Rome the giantess fell — I placed myself before the falling statue — she fell and did not crush me . Nations sprang up and disappeared before me ;— but I remained and did not die . From cloud-encircled cliffs did I precipitate myself into the ocean ; but the foaming billows cast me upon the shore , and the burning arrow of existence pierced my cold heart again . I leaped into Etna 's flaming abyss , and roared with the giants for ten long months , polluting with my groans the Mount 's sulphureous mouth — ah ! ten long months . The volcano fermented , and in a fiery stream of lava cast me up . I lay torn by the torture-snakes of hell amid the glowing cinders , and yet continued to exist .— A forest was on fire : I darted on wings of fury and despair into the crackling wood . Fire dropped upon me from the trees , but the flames only singed my limbs ; alas ! it could not consume them .— I now mixed with the butchers of mankind , and plunged in the tempest of the raging battle . I roared defiance to the infuriate Gaul , defiance to the victorious German ; but arrows and spears rebounded in shivers from my body . The Saracen 's flaming sword broke upon my skull : balls in vain hissed upon me : the lightnings of battle glared harmless around my loins : in vain did the elephant trample on me , in vain the iron hoof of the wrathful steed ! The mine , big with destructive power , burst upon me , and hurled me high in the air — I fell on heaps of smoking limbs , but was only singed . The giant 's steel club rebounded from my body ; the executioner 's hand could not strangle me , the tiger 's tooth could not pierce me , nor would the hungry lion in the circus devour me . I cohabited with poisonous snakes , and pinched the red crest of the dragon .— The serpent stung , but could not destroy me . The dragon tormented , but dared not to devour me .— I now provoked the fury of tyrants : I said to Nero , ‘ Thou art a bloodhound ! ’ I said to Christiern , ‘ Thou art a bloodhound !, I said to Muley Ismail , ‘ Thou art a bloodhound ! ’ — The tyrants invented cruel torments , but did not kill me . Ha ! not to be able to die — not to be able to die — not to be permitted to rest after the toils of life — to be doomed to be imprisoned for ever in the clay-formed dungeon — to be for ever clogged with this worthless body , its lead of diseases and infirmities — to be condemned to [ be ] hold for millenniums that yawning monster Sameness , and Time , that hungry hyaena , ever bearing children , and ever devouring again her offspring !— Ha ! not to be permitted to die ! Awful Avenger in Heaven , hast Thou in Thine armoury of wrath a punishment more dreadful ? then let it thunder upon me , command a hurricane to sweep me down to the foot of Carmel , that I there may lie extended ; may pant , and writhe , and die .! " ’</p>
    <p n="403">This fragment is the translation of part of some German work , whose title I have vainly endeavoured to discover . I picked it up , dirty and torn , some years ago , in Lincoln'shYpppHeNInn Fields .</p>
    <p n="404">7 . 135 , 136 :—</p>
    <p n="405">I will beget a Son , and He shall bear The sins of all the world .</p>
    <p n="406">A book is put into our hands when children , called the Bible , the purport of whose history is briefly this : That God made the earth in six days , and there planted a delightful garden , in which He placed the first pair of human beings . In the midst of the garden He planted a tree , whose fruit , although within their reach , they were forbidden to touch . That the Devil , in the shape of a snake , persuaded them to eat of this fruit ; in consequence of which God condemned both them and their posterity yet unborn to satisfy His justice by their eternal misery . That , four thousand years after these events ( the human race in the meanwhile having gone unredeemed to perdition ) , God engendered with the betrothed wife of a carpenter in Judea ( whose virginity was nevertheless uninjured ) , and begat a son , whose name was Jesus Christ ; and who was crucified and died , in order that no more men might be devoted to hell-fire , He bearing the burthen of His Father 's displeasure by proxy . The book states , in addition , that the soul of whoever disbelieves this sacrifice will be burned with everlasting fire .</p>
    <p n="407">During many ages of misery and darkness this story gained implicit belief ; but at length men arose who suspected that it was a fable and imposture , and that Jesus Christ , so far from being a God , was only a man like themselves . But a numerous set of men , who derived and still derive immense emoluments from this opinion , in the shape of a popular belief , told the vulgar that if they did not believe in the Bible they would be damned to all eternity ; and burned , imprisoned , and poisoned all the unbiassed and unconnected inquirers who occasionally arose . They still oppress them , so far as the people , now become more enlightened , will allow .</p>
    <p n="408">The belief in all that the Bible contains is called Christianity . A Roman governor of Judea , at the instance of a priest-led mob , crucified a man called Jesus eighteen centuries ago . He was a man of pure life , who desired to rescue his countrymen from the tyranny of their barbarous and degrading superstitions . The common fate of all who desire to benefit mankind awaited him . The rabble , at the instigation of the priests , demanded his death , although his very judge made public acknowledgement of his innocence . Jesus was sacrificed to the honour of that God with whom he was afterwards confounded . It is of importance , therefore , to distinguish between the pretended character of this being as the Son of God and the Saviour of the world , and his real character as a man , who , for a vain attempt to reform the world , paid the forfeit of his life to that overbearing tyranny which has since so long desolated the universe in his name . Whilst the one is a hypocritical Daemon , who announces Himself as the God of compassion and peace , even whilst He stretches forth His blood-red hand with the sword of discord to waste the earth , having confessedly devised this scheme of desolation from eternity ; the other stands in the foremost list of those true heroes who have died in the glorious martyrdom of liberty , and have braved torture , contempt , and poverty in the cause of suffering humanity . ( Since writing this note I have some reason to suspect that Jesus was an ambitious man , who aspired to the throne of Judea .</p>
    <p n="409">The vulgar , ever in extremes , became persuaded that the crucifixion of Jesus was a supernatural event . Testimonies of miracles , so frequent in unenlightened ages , were not wanting to prove that he was something divine . This belief , rolling through the lapse of ages , met with the reveries of Plato and the reasonings of Aristotle , and acquired force and extent , until the divinity of Jesus became a dogma , which to dispute was death , which to doubt was infamy .</p>
    <p n="410">CHRISTIANITY is now the established religion : he who attempts to impugn it must be contented to behold murderers and traitors take precedence of him in public opinion ; though , if his genius be equal to his courage , and assisted by a peculiar coalition of circumstances , future ages may exalt him to a divinity , and persecute others in his name , as he was persecuted in the name of his predecessor in the homage of the world .</p>
    <p n="411">The same means that have supported every other popular belief have supported Christianity . War , imprisonment , assassination , and falsehood ; deeds of unexampled and incomparable atrocity have made it what it is . The blood shed by the votaries of the God of mercy and peace , since the establishment of His religion , would probably suffice to drown all other sectaries now on the habitable globe . We derive from our ancestors a faith thus fostered and supported : we quarrel , persecute , and hate for its maintenance . Even under a government which , whilst it infringes the very right of thought and speech , boasts of permitting the liberty of the press , a man is pilloried and imprisoned because he is a deist , and no one raises his voice in the indignation of outraged humanity . But it is ever a proof that the falsehood of a proposition is felt by those who use coercion , not reasoning , to procure its admission ; and a dispassionate observer would feel himself more powerfully interested in favour of a man who , depending on the truth of his opinions , simply stated his reasons for entertaining them , than in that of his aggressor who , daringly avowing his unwillingness or incapacity to answer them by argument , proceeded to repress the energies and break the spirit of their promulgator by that torture and imprisonment whose infliction he could command .</p>
    <p n="412">Analogy seems to favour the opinion that as , like other systems , Christianity has arisen and augmented , so like them it will decay and perish ; that as violence , darkness , and deceit , not reasoning and persuasion , have procured its admission among mankind , so , when enthusiasm has subsided , and time , that infallible controverter of false opinions , has involved its pretended evidences in the darkness of antiquity , it will become obsolete ; that Milton 's poem alone will give permanency to the remembrance of its absurdities ; and that men will laugh as heartily at grace , faith , redemption , and original sin , as they now do at the metamorphoses of Jupiter , the miracles of Romish saints , the efficacy of witchcraft , and the appearance of departed spirits .</p>
    <p n="413">Had the Christian religion commenced and continued by the mere force of reasoning and persuasion , the preceding analogy would be inadmissible . We should never speculate on the future obsoleteness of a system perfectly conformable to nature and reason : it would endure so long as they endured ; it would be a truth as indisputable as the light of the sun , the criminality of murder , and other facts , whose evidence , depending on our organization and relative situations , must remain acknowledged as satisfactory so long as man is man . It is an incontrovertible fact , the consideration of which ought to repress the hasty conclusions of credulity , or moderate its obstinacy in maintaining them , that , had the Jews not been a fanatical race of men , had even the resolution of Pontius Pilate been equal to his candour , the Christian religion never could have prevailed , it could not even have existed : on so feeble a thread hangs the most cherished opinion of a sixth of the human race ! When will the vulgar learn humility ? When will the pride of ignorance blush at having believed before it could comprehend ?</p>
    <p n="414">Either the Christian religion is true , or it is false : if true , it comes from God , and its authenticity can admit of doubt and dispute no further than its omnipotent author is willing to allow . Either the power or the goodness of God is called in question , if He leaves those doctrines most essential to the well-being of man in doubt and dispute ; the only ones which , since their promulgation , have been the subject of unceasing cavil , the cause of irreconcilable hatred . IF GOD HAS SPOKEN , WHY IS THE UNIVERSE NOT CONVINCED ?</p>
    <p n="415">There is this passage in the Christian Scriptures : ‘ Those who obey not God , and believe not the Gospel of his Son , shall be punished with everlasting destruction . ’ This is the pivot upon which all religions turn :— they all assume that it is in our power to believe or not to believe ; whereas the mind can only believe that which it thinks true . A human being can only be supposed accountable for those actions which are influenced by his will . But belief is utterly distinct from and unconnected with volition : it is the apprehension of the agreement or disagreement of the ideas that compose any preposition . Belief is a passion , or involuntary operation of the mind , and , like other passions , its intensity is precisely proportionate to the degrees of excitement . Volition is essential to merit or demerit . But the Christian religion attaches the highest possible degrees of merit and demerit to that which is worthy of neither , and which is totally unconnected with the peculiar faculty of the mind , whose presence is essential to their being .</p>
    <p n="416">Christianity was intended to reform the world : had an all-wise Being planned it , nothing is more improbable than that it should have failed : omniscience would infallibly have foreseen the inutility of a scheme which experience demonstrates , to this age , to have been utterly unsuccessful .</p>
    <p n="417">Christianity inculcates the necessity of supplicating the Deity . Prayer may be considered under two points of view ;— as an endeavour to change the intentions of God , or as a formal testimony of our obedience . But the former case supposes that the caprices of a limited intelligence can occasionally instruct the Creator of the world how to regulate the universe ; and the latter , a certain degree of servility analogous to the loyalty demanded by earthly tyrants . Obedience indeed is only the pitiful and cowardly egotism of him who thinks that he can do something better than reason .</p>
    <p n="418">Christianity , like all other religions , rests upon miracles , prophecies , and martyrdoms . No religion ever existed which had not its prophets , its attested miracles , and , above all , crowds of devotees who would bear patiently the most horrible tortures to prove its authenticity . It should appear that in no case can a discriminating mind subscribe to the genuineness of a miracle . A miracle is an infraction of nature 's law , by a supernatural cause ; by a cause acting beyond that eternal circle within which all things are included . God breaks through the law of nature , that He may convince mankind of the truth of that revelation which , in spite of His precautions , has been , since its introduction , the subject of unceasing schism and cavil .</p>
    <p n="419">Miracles resolve themselves into the following question ( See Hume 's Essay , volume 2 page 121 . ):— Whether it is more probable the laws of nature , hitherto so immutably harmonious , should have undergone violation , or that a man should have told a lie ? Whether it is more probable that we are ignorant of the natural cause of an event , or that we know the supernatural one ? That , in old times , when the powers of nature were less known than at present , a certain set of men were themselves deceived , or had some hidden motive for deceiving others ; or that God begat a Son , who , in His legislation , measuring merit by belief , evidenced Himself to be totally ignorant of the powers of the human mind — of what is voluntary , and what is the contrary ?</p>
    <p n="420">We have many instances of men telling lies ;— none of an infraction of nature 's laws , those laws of whose government alone we have any knowledge or experience . The records of all nations afford innumerable instances of men deceiving others either from vanity or interest , or themselves being deceived by the limitedness of their views and their ignorance of natural causes : but where is the accredited case of God having come upon earth , to give the lie to His own creations ? There would be something truly wonderful in the appearance of a ghost ; but the assertion of a child that he saw one as he passed through the churchyard is universally admitted to be less miraculous .</p>
    <p n="421">But even supposing that a man should raise a dead body to life before our eyes , and on this fact rest his claim to being considered the son of God ;— the Humane Society restores drowned persons , and because it makes no mystery of the method it employs , its members are not mistaken for the sons of God . All that we have a right to infer from our ignorance of the cause of any event is that we do not know it : had the Mexicans attended to this simple rule when they heard the cannon of the Spaniards , they would not have considered them as gods : the experiments of modern chemistry would have defied the wisest philosophers of ancient Greece and Rome to have accounted for them on natural principles . An author of strong common sense has observed that ‘ a miracle is no miracle at second-hand ’ ; he might have added that a miracle is no miracle in any case ; for until we are acquainted with all natural causes , we have no reason to imagine others .</p>
    <p n="422">There remains to be considered another proof of Christianity — Prophecy . A book is written before a certain event , in which this event is foretold ; how could the prophet have foreknown it without inspiration ? how could he have been inspired without God ? The greatest stress is laid on the prophecies of Moses and Hosea on the dispersion of the Jews , and that of Isaiah concerning the coming of the Messiah . The prophecy of Moses is a collection of every possible cursing and blessing ; and it is so far from being marvellous that the one of dispersion should have been fulfilled , that it would have been more surprising if , out of all these , none should have taken effect . In Deuteronomy , chapter 28 , verse 64 , where Moses explicitly foretells the dispersion , he states that they shall there serve gods of wood and stone : ‘ And the Lord shall scatter thee among all people , from the one end of the earth even to the other ; AND THERE THOU SHALT SERVE OTHER GODS , WHICH NEITHER THOU NOR THY FATHERS HAVE KNOWN , EVEN GODS OF WOOD AND STONE . ’ The Jews are at this day remarkably tenacious of their religion . Moses also declares that they shall be subjected to these curses for disobedience to his ritual : ‘ And it shall come to pass , if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God , to observe to do all the commandments and statutes which I command thee this day ; that all these curses shall come upon thee , and overtake thee . ’ Is this the real reason ? The third , fourth , and fifth chapters of Hosea are a piece of immodest confession . The indelicate type might apply in a hundred senses to a hundred things . The fifty-third chapter of Isaiah is more explicit , yet it does not exceed in clearness the oracles of Delphos . The historical proof that Moses , Isaiah , and Hosea did write when they are said to have written is far from being clear and circumstantial .</p>
    <p n="423">But prophecy requires proof in its character as a miracle ; we have no right to suppose that a man foreknew future events from God , until it is demonstrated that he neither could know them by his own exertions , nor that the writings which contain the prediction could possibly have been fabricated after the event pretended to be foretold . It is more probable that writings , pretending to divine inspiration , should have been fabricated after the fulfilment of their pretended prediction than that they should have really been divinely inspired , when we consider that the latter supposition makes God at once the creator of the human mind and ignorant of its primary powers , particularly as we have numberless instances of false religions , and forged prophecies of things long past , and no accredited case of God having conversed with men directly or indirectly . It is also possible that the description of an event might have foregone its occurrence ; but this is far from being a legitimate proof of a divine revelation , as many men , not pretending to the character of a prophet , have nevertheless , in this sense , prophesied .</p>
    <p n="424">Lord Chesterfield was never yet taken for a prophet , even by a bishop , yet he uttered this remarkable prediction : ‘ The despotic government of France is screwed up to the highest pitch ; a revolution is fast approaching ; that revolution , I am convinced , will be radical and sanguinary . ’ This appeared in the letters of the prophet long before the accomplishment of this wonderful prediction . Now , have these particulars come to pass , or have they not ? If they have , how could the Earl have foreknown them without inspiration ? If we admit the truth of the Christian religion on testimony such as this , we must admit , on the same strength of evidence , that God has affixed the highest rewards to belief , and the eternal tortures of the never-dying worm to disbelief , both of which have been demonstrated to be involuntary .</p>
    <p n="425">The last proof of the Christian religion depends on the influence of the Holy Ghost . Theologians divide the influence of the Holy Ghost into its ordinary and extraordinary modes of operation . The latter is supposed to be that which inspired the Prophets and Apostles ; and the former to be the grace of God , which summarily makes known the truth of His revelation to those whose mind is fitted for its reception by a submissive perusal of His word . Persons convinced in this manner can do anything but account for their conviction , describe the time at which it happened , or the manner in which it came upon them . It is supposed to enter the mind by other channels than those of the senses , and therefore professes to be superior to reason founded on their experience .</p>
    <p n="426">Admitting , however , the usefulness or possibility of a divine revelation , unless we demolish the foundations of all human knowledge , it is requisite that our reason should previously demonstrate its genuineness ; for , before we extinguish the steady ray of reason and common sense , it is fit that we should discover whether we cannot do without their assistance , whether or no there be any other which may suffice to guide us through the labyrinth of life ( See Locke 's “ Essay on the Human Understanding ” , book 4 chapter 19 , on Enthusiasm . ): for , if a man is to be inspired upon all occasions , if he is to be sure of a thing because he is sure , if the ordinary operations of the Spirit are not to be considered very extraordinary modes of demonstration , if enthusiasm is to usurp the place of proof , and madness that of sanity , all reasoning is superfluous . The Mahometan dies fighting for his prophet , the Indian immolates himself at the chariot-wheels of Brahma , the Hottentot worships an insect , the Negro a bunch of feathers , the Mexican sacrifices human victims ! Their degree of conviction must certainly be very strong : it cannot arise from reasoning , it must from feelings , the reward of their prayers . If each of these should affirm , in opposition to the strongest possible arguments , that inspiration carried internal evidence , I fear their inspired brethren , the orthodox missionaries , would be so uncharitable as to pronounce them obstinate .</p>
    <p n="427">Miracles cannot be received as testimonies of a disputed fact , because all human testimony has ever been insufficient to establish the possibility of miracles . That which is incapable of proof itself is no proof of anything else . Prophecy has also been rejected by the test of reason . Those , then , who have been actually inspired are the only true believers in the Christian religion .</p>

    <p n="432">Time is our consciousness of the succession of ideas in our mind . Vivid sensation , of either pain or pleasure , makes the time seem long , as the common phrase is , because it renders us more acutely conscious of our ideas . If a mind be conscious of an hundred ideas during one minute , by the clock , and of two hundred during another , the latter of these spaces would actually occupy so much greater extent in the mind as two exceed one in quantity . If , therefore , the human mind , by any future improvement of its sensibility , should become conscious of an infinite number of ideas in a minute , that minute would be eternity . I do not hence infer that the actual space between the birth and death of a man will ever be prolonged ; but that his sensibility is perfectible , and that the number of ideas which his mind is capable of receiving is indefinite . One man is stretched on the rack during twelve hours ; another sleeps soundly in his bed : the difference of time perceived by these two persons is immense ; one hardly will believe that half an hour has elapsed , the other could credit that centuries had flown during his agony . Thus , the life of a man of virtue and talent , who should die in his thirtieth year , is , with regard to his own feelings , longer than that of a miserable priest-ridden slave , who dreams out a century of dulness . The one has perpetually cultivated his mental faculties , has rendered himself master of his thoughts , can abstract and generalize amid the lethargy of every-day business ;— the other can slumber over the brightest moments of his being , and is unable to remember the happiest hour of his life . Perhaps the perishing ephemeron enjoys a longer life than the tortoise .</p>

    <p n="437">I hold that the depravity of the physical and moral nature of man originated in his unnatural habits of life . The origin of man , like that of the universe of which he is a part , is enveloped in impenetrable mystery . His generations either had a beginning , or they had not . The weight of evidence in favour of each of these suppositions seems tolerably equal ; and it is perfectly unimportant to the present argument which is assumed . The language spoken , however , by the mythology of nearly all religions seems to prove that at some distant period man forsook the path of nature , and sacrificed the purity and happiness of his being to unnatural appetites . The date of this event seems to have also been that of some great change in the climates of the earth , with which it has an obvious correspondence . The allegory of Adam and Eve eating of the tree of evil , and entailing upon their posterity the wrath of God and the loss of everlasting life , admits of no other explanation than the disease and crime that have flowed from unnatural diet . Milton was so well aware of this that he makes Raphael thus exhibit to Adam the consequence of his disobedience :—</p>
    <p n="438">Immediately a place Before his eyes appeared , sad , noisome , dark ; A lazar-house it seemed ; wherein were laid Numbers of all diseased — all maladies Of ghastly spasm , or racking torture , qualms Of heart-sick agony , all feverous kinds , Convulsions , epilepsies , fierce catarrhs , Intestine stone and ulcer , colic pangs , Demoniac frenzy , moping melancholy , And moon-struck madness , pining atrophy , Marasmus , and wide-wasting pestilence , Dropsies and asthmas , and joint-racking rheums .</p>
    <p n="439">And how many thousands more might not be added to this frightful catalogue !</p>
    <p n="440">The story of Prometheus is one likewise which , although universally admitted to be allegorical , has never been satisfactorily explained . Prometheus stole fire from heaven , and was chained for this crime to Mount Caucasus , where a vulture continually devoured his liver , that grew to meet its hunger . Hesiod says that , before the time of Prometheus , mankind were exempt from suffering ; that they enjoyed a vigorous youth , and that death , when at length it came , approached like sleep , and gently closed their eyes . Again , so general was this opinion that Horace , a poet of the Augustan age , writes :—</p>
    <p n="441">Audax omnia perpeti , Gens humana ruit per vetitum nefas ; Audax Iapeti genus Ignem fraude mala gentibus intulit : Post ignem aetheria domo Subductum , macies et nova febrium Terris incubuit cohors , Semotique prius tarda necessitas Lethi corripuit gradum .</p>
    <p n="442">How plain a language is spoken by all this ! Prometheus ( who represents the human race ) effected some great change in the condition of his nature , and applied fire to culinary purposes ; thus inventing an expedient for screening from his disgust the horrors of the shambles . From this moment his vitals were devoured by the vulture of disease . It consumed his being in every shape of its loathsome and infinite variety , inducing the soul-quelling sinkings of premature and violent death . All vice rose from the ruin of healthful innocence . Tyranny , superstition , commerce , and inequality were then first known , when reason vainly attempted to guide the wanderings of exacerbated passion . I conclude this part of the subject with an extract from Mr. Newton 's “ Defence of Vegetable Regimen ” , from whom I have borrowed this interpretation of the fable of Prometheus .</p>
    <p n="443">‘ Making allowance for such transposition of the events of the allegory as time might produce after the important truths were forgotten , which this portion of the ancient mythology was intended to transmit , the drift of the fable seems to be this :— Man at his creation was endowed with the gift of perpetual youth ; that is , he was not formed to be a sickly suffering creature as we now see him , but to enjoy health , and to sink by slow degrees into the bosom of his parent earth without disease or pain . Prometheus first taught the use of animal food ( primus bovem occidit Prometheus ( Plin . “ Nat . Hist ” . lib . 7 sect . 57 . )) and of fire , with which to render it more digestible and pleasing to the taste . Jupiter , and the rest of the gods , foreseeing the consequences of these inventions , were amused or irritated at the short-sighted devices of the newly-formed creature , and left him to experience the sad effects of them . Thirst , the necessary concomitant of a flesh diet ’ ( perhaps of all diet vitiated by culinary preparation ) , ‘ ensued ; water was resorted to , and man forfeited the inestimable gift of health which he had received from heaven : he became diseased , the partaker of a precarious existence , and no longer descended slowly to his grave . ( “ Return to Nature ” . Cadell , 1811 . )</p>
    <p n="444">But just disease to luxury succeeds , And every death its own avenger breeds ; The fury passions from that blood began , And turned on man a fiercer savage — man .</p>
    <p n="445">Man , and the animals whom he has infected with his society , or depraved by his dominion , are alone diseased . The wild hog , the mouflon , the bison , and the wolf ; are perfectly exempt from malady , and invariably die either from external violence or natural old age . But the domestic hog , the sheep , the cow , and the dog , are subject to an incredible variety of distempers ; and , like the corruptors of their nature , have physicians who thrive upon their miseries . The supereminence of man is like Satan 's , a supereminence of pain ; and the majority of his species , doomed to penury , disease , and crime , have reason to curse the untoward event that , by enabling him to communicate his sensations , raised him above the level of his fellow-animals . But the steps that have been taken are irrevocable . The whole of human science is comprised in one question :— How can the advantages of intellect and civilization be reconciled with the liberty and pure pleasures of natural life ? How can we take the benefits and reject the evils of the system , which is now interwoven with all the fibres of our being ?— I believe that abstinence from animal food and spirituous liquors would in a great measure capacitate us for the solution of this important question .</p>
    <p n="446">It is true that mental and bodily derangement is attributable in part to other deviations from rectitude and nature than those which concern diet . The mistakes cherished by society respecting the connection of the sexes , whence the misery and diseases of unsatisfied celibacy , unenjoying prostitution , and the premature arrival of puberty , necessarily spring ; the putrid atmosphere of crowded cities ; the exhalations of chemical processes ; the muffling of our bodies in superfluous apparel ; the absurd treatment of infants :— all these and innumerable other causes contribute their mite to the mass of human evil .</p>
    <p n="447">Comparative anatomy teaches us that man resembles frugivorous animals in everything , and carnivorous in nothing ; he has neither claws wherewith to seize his prey , nor distinct and pointed teeth to tear the living fibre . A Mandarin of the first class , with nails two inches long , would probably find them alone inefficient to hold even a hare . After every subterfuge of gluttony , the bull must be degraded into the ox , and the ram into the wether , by an unnatural and inhuman operation , that the flaccid fibre may offer a fainter resistance to rebellious nature . It is only by softening and disguising dead flesh by culinary preparation that it is rendered susceptible of mastication or digestion ; and that the sight of its bloody juices and raw horror does not excite intolerable loathing and disgust . Let the advocate of animal food force himself to a decisive experiment on its fitness , and , as Plutarch recommends , tear a living lamb with his teeth , and plunging his head into its vitals slake his thirst with the steaming blood ; when fresh from the deed of horror , let him revert to the irresistible instincts of nature that would rise in judgement against it , and say , ‘ Nature formed me for such work as this . ’ Then , and then only , would he be consistent .</p>
    <p n="448">Man resembles no carnivorous animal . There is no exception , unless man be one , to the rule of herbivorous animals having cellulated colons .</p>
    <p n="449">The orang-outang perfectly resembles man both in the order and number of his teeth . The orang-outang is the most anthropomorphous of the ape tribe , all of which are strictly frugivorous . There is no other species of animals , which live on different food , in which this analogy exists . ( Cuvier , “ Lecons d'Anat . Comp ” . tom . 3 , pages 169 , 373 , 448 , 465 , 480 . Rees 's “ Cyclopaedia ” , article Man . ) In many frugivorous animals , the canine teeth are more pointed and distinct than those of man . The resemblance also of the human stomach to that of the orang-outang is greater than to that of any other animal .</p>
    <p n="450">The intestines are also identical with those of herbivorous animals , which present a larger surface for absorption and have ample and cellulated colons . The caecum also , though short , is larger than that of carnivorous animals ; and even here the orang-outang retains its accustomed similarity .</p>
    <p n="451">The structure of the human frame , then , is that of one fitted to a pure vegetable diet , in every essential particular . It is true that the reluctance to abstain from animal food , in those who have been long accustomed to its stimulus , is so great in some persons of weak minds as to be scarcely overcome ; but this is far from bringing any argument in its favour . A lamb , which was fed for some time on flesh by a ship 's crew , refused its natural diet at the end of the voyage . There are numerous instances of horses , sheep , oxen , and even wood-pigeons , having been taught to live upon flesh , until they have loathed their natural aliment . Young children evidently prefer pastry , oranges , apples , and other fruit , to the flesh of animals ; until , by the gradual depravation of the digestive organs , the free use of vegetables has for a time produced serious inconveniences ; FOR A TIME , I say , since there never was an instance wherein a change from spirituous liquors and animal food to vegetables and pure water has failed ultimately to invigorate the body , by rendering its juices bland and consentaneous , and to restore to the mind that cheerfulness and elasticity which not one in fifty possesses on the present system . A love of strong liquors is also with difficulty taught to infants . Almost every one remembers the wry faces which the first glass of port produced . Unsophisticated instinct is invariably unerring ; but to decide on the fitness of animal food from the perverted appetites which its constrained adoption produces ; is to make the criminal a judge in his own cause : it is even worse , it is appealing to the infatuated drunkard in a question of the salubrity of brandy .</p>
    <p n="452">What is the cause of morbid action in the animal system ? Not the air we breathe , for our fellow-denizens of nature breathe the same uninjured ; not the water we drink ( if remote from the pollutions of man and his inventions ( The necessity of resorting to some means of purifying water , and the disease which arises from its adulteration in civilized countries , is sufficiently apparent . See Dr. Lambe 's “ Reports on Cancer ” . I do not assert that the use of water is in itself unnatural , but that the unperverted palate would swallow no liquid capable of occasioning disease . )) , for the animals drink it too ; not the earth we tread upon ; not the unobscured sight of glorious nature , in the wood , the field , or the expanse of sky and ocean ; nothing that we are or do in common with the undiseased inhabitants of the forest . Something , then , wherein we differ from them : our habit of altering our food by fire , so that our appetite is no longer a just criterion for the fitness of its gratification . Except in children , there remain no traces of that instinct which determines , in all other animals , what aliment is natural or otherwise ; and so perfectly obliterated are they in the reasoning adults of our species , that it has become necessary to urge considerations drawn from comparative anatomy to prove that we are naturally frugivorous .</p>
    <p n="453">Crime is madness . Madness is disease . Whenever the cause of disease shall be discovered , the root , from which all vice and misery have so long overshadowed the globe , will lie bare to the axe . All the exertions of man , from that moment , may be considered as tending to the clear profit of his species . No sane mind in a sane body resolves upon a real crime . It is a man of violent passions , bloodshot eyes , and swollen veins , that alone can grasp the knife of murder . The system of a simple diet promises no Utopian advantages . It is no mere reform of legislation , whilst the furious passions and evil propensities of the human heart , in which it had its origin , are still unassuaged . It strikes at the root of all evil , and is an experiment which may be tried with success , not alone by nations , but by small societies , families , and even individuals . In no cases has a return to vegetable diet produced the slightest injury ; in most it has been attended with changes undeniably beneficial . Should ever a physician be born with the genius of Locke , I am persuaded that he might trace all bodily and mental derangements to our unnatural habits , as clearly as that philosopher has traced all knowledge to sensation . What prolific sources of disease are not those mineral and vegetable poisons that have been introduced for its extirpation ! How many thousands have become murderers and robbers , bigots and domestic tyrants , dissolute and abandoned adventurers , from the use of fermented liquors ; who , had they slaked their thirst only with pure water , would have lived but to diffuse the happiness of their own unperverted feelings ! How many groundless opinions and absurd institutions have not received a general sanction from the sottishness and intemperance of individuals ! Who will assert that , had the populace of Paris satisfied their hunger at the ever-furnished table of vegetable nature , they would have lent their brutal suffrage to the proscription-list of Robespierre ? Could a set of men , whose passions were not perverted by unnatural stimuli , look with coolness on an auto da fe ? Is it to be believed that a being of gentle feelings , rising from his meal of roots , would take delight in sports of blood ? Was Nero a man of temperate life ? could you read calm health in his cheek , flushed with ungovernable propensities of hatred for the human race ? Did Muley Ismael 's pulse beat evenly , was his skin transparent , did his eyes beam with healthfulness , and its invariable concomitants , cheerfulness and benignity ? Though history has decided none of these questions , a child could not hesitate to answer in the negative . Surely the bile-suffused cheek of Buonaparte , his wrinkled brow , and yellow eye , the ceaseless inquietude of his nervous system , speak no less plainly the character of his unresting ambition than his murders and his victories . It is impossible , had Buonaparte descended from a race of vegetable feeders , that he could have had either the inclination or the power to ascend the throne of the Bourbons . The desire of tyranny could scarcely be excited in the individual , the power to tyrannize would certainly not be delegated by a society neither frenzied by inebriation nor rendered impotent and irrational by disease . Pregnant indeed with inexhaustible calamity is the renunciation of instinct , as it concerns our physical nature ; arithmetic cannot enumerate , nor reason perhaps suspect , the multitudinous sources of disease in civilized life . Even common water , that apparently innoxious pabulum , when corrupted by the filth of populous cities , is a deadly and insidious destroyer . ( Lambe 's “ Reports on Cancer ” . ) Who can wonder that all the inducements held out by God Himself in the Bible to virtue should have been vainer than a nurse 's tale ; and that those dogmas , by which He has there excited and justified the most ferocious propensities , should have alone been deemed essential ; whilst Christians are in the daily practice of all those habits which have infected with disease and crime , not only the reprobate sons , but those favoured children of the common Father 's love ? Omnipotence itself could not save them from the consequences of this original and universal sin .</p>
    <p n="454">There is no disease , bodily or mental , which adoption of vegetable diet and pure water has not infallibly mitigated , wherever the experiment has been fairly tried . Debility is gradually converted into strength ; disease into healthfulness ; madness , in all its hideous variety , from the ravings of the fettered maniac to the unaccountable irrationalities of ill-temper , that make a hell of domestic life , into a calm and considerate evenness of temper , that alone might offer a certain pledge of the future moral reformation of society . On a natural system of diet , old age would be our last and our only malady ; the term of our existence would be protracted ; we should enjoy life , and no longer preclude others from the enjoyment of it ; all sensational delights would be infinitely more exquisite and perfect ; the very sense of being would then be a continued pleasure , such as we now feel it in some few and favoured moments of our youth . By all that is sacred in our hopes for the human race , I conjure those who love happiness and truth to give a fair trial to the vegetable system . Reasoning is surely superfluous on a subject whose merits an experience of six months would set for ever at rest . But it is only among the enlightened and benevolent that so great a sacrifice of appetite and prejudice can be expected , even though its ultimate excellence should not admit of dispute . It is found easier , by the short-sighted victims of disease , to palliate their torments by medicine than to prevent them by regimen . The vulgar of all ranks are invariably sensual and indocile ; yet I cannot but feel myself persuaded that when the benefits of vegetable diet are mathematically proved , when it is as clear that those who live naturally are exempt from premature death as that nine is not one , the most sottish of mankind will feel a preference towards a long and tranquil , contrasted with a short and painful , life . On the average , out of sixty persons four die in three years . Hopes are entertained that , in April , 1814 , a statement will be given that sixty persons , all having lived more than three years on vegetables and pure water , are then IN PERFECT HEALTH . More than two years have now elapsed ; NOT ONE OF THEM HAS DIED ; no such example will be found in any sixty persons taken at random . Seventeen persons of all ages ( the families of Dr. Lambe and Mr. Newton ) have lived for seven years on this diet without a death , and almost without the slightest illness . Surely , when we consider that some of those were infants , and one a martyr to asthma now nearly subdued , we may challenge any seventeen persons taken at random in this city to exhibit a parallel case . Those who may have been excited to question the rectitude of established habits of diet by these loose remarks , should consult Mr. Newton 's luminous and eloquent essay . ( “ Return to Nature , or Defence of Vegetable Regimen ” . Cadell , 1811 . )</p>
    <p n="455">When these proofs come fairly before the world , and are clearly seen by all who understand arithmetic , it is scarcely possible that abstinence from aliments demonstrably pernicious should not become universal . In proportion to the number of proselytes , so will be the weight of evidence ; and when a thousand persons can be produced , living on vegetables and distilled water , who have to dread no disease but old age , the world will be compelled to regard animal flesh and fermented liquors as slow but certain poisons . The change which would be produced by simpler habits on political economy is sufficiently remarkable . The monopolizing eater of animal flesh would no longer destroy his constitution by devouring an acre at a meal , and many loaves of bread would cease to contribute to gout , madness and apoplexy , in the shape of a pint of porter , or a dram of gin , when appeasing the long-protracted famine of the hardworking peasant 's hungry babes . The quantity of nutritious vegetable matter , consumed in fattening the carcase of an ox , would afford ten times the sustenance , undepraving indeed , and incapable of generating disease , if gathered immediately from the bosom of the earth . The most fertile districts of the habitable globe are now actually cultivated by men for animals , at a delay and waste of aliment absolutely incapable of calculation . It is only the wealthy that can , to any great degree , even now , indulge the unnatural craving for dead flesh , and they pay for the greater licence of the privilege by subjection to supernumerary diseases . Again , the spirit of the nation that should take the lead in this great reform would insensibly become agricultural ; commerce , with all its vice , selfishness , and corruption , would gradually decline ; more natural habits would produce gentler manners , and the excessive complication of political relations would be so far simplified that every individual might feel and understand why he loved his country , and took a personal interest in its welfare . How would England , for example , depend on the caprices of foreign rulers if she contained within herself all the necessaries , and despised whatever they possessed of the luxuries , of life ? How could they starve her into compliance with their views ? Of what consequence would it be that they refused to take her woollen manufactures , when large and fertile tracts of the island ceased to be allotted to the waste of pasturage ? On a natural system of diet we should require no spices from India ; no wines from Portugal , Spain , France , or Madeira ; none of those multitudinous articles of luxury , for which every corner of the globe is rifled , and which are the causes of so much individual rivalship , such calamitous and sanguinary national disputes . In the history of modern times , the avarice of commercial monopoly , no less than the ambition of weak and wicked chiefs , seems to have fomented the universal discord , to have added stubbornness to the mistakes of cabinets , and indocility to the infatuation of the people . Let it ever be remembered that it is the direct influence of commerce to make the interval between the richest and the poorest man wider and more unconquerable . Let it be remembered that it is a foe to everything of real worth and excellence in the human character . The odious and disgusting aristocracy of wealth is built upon the ruins of all that is good in chivalry or republicanism ; and luxury is the forerunner of a barbarism scarce capable of cure . Is it impossible to realize a state of society , where all the energies of man shall be directed to the production of his solid happiness ? Certainly , if this advantage ( the object of all political speculation ) be in any degree attainable , it is attainable only by a community which holds out no factitious incentives to the avarice and ambition of the few , and which is internally organized for the liberty , security , and comfort of the many . None must be entrusted with power ( and money is the completest species of power ) who do not stand pledged to use it exclusively for the general benefit . But the use of animal flesh and fermented liquors directly militates with this equality of the rights of man . The peasant cannot gratify these fashionable cravings without leaving his family to starve . Without disease and war , those sweeping curtailers of population , pasturage would include a waste too great to be afforded . The labour requisite to support a family is far lighter ’ than is usually supposed . ( It has come under the author 's experience that some of the workmen on an embankment in North Wales , who , in consequence of the inability of the proprietor to pay them , seldom received their wages , have supported large families by cultivating small spots of sterile ground by moonlight . In the notes to Pratt 's poem , “ Bread , or the Poor ” , is an account of an industrious labourer who , by working in a small garden , before and after his day 's task , attained to an enviable state of independence . ) The peasantry work , not only for themselves , but for the aristocracy , the army , and the manufacturers .</p>
    <p n="456">The advantage of a reform in diet is obviously greater than that of any other . It strikes at the root of the evil . To remedy the abuses of legislation , before we annihilate the propensities by which they are produced , is to suppose that by taking away the effect the cause will cease to operate . But the efficacy of this system depends entirely on the proselytism of individuals , and grounds its merits , as a benefit to the community , upon the total change of the dietetic habits in its members . It proceeds securely from a number of particular cases to one that is universal , and has this advantage over the contrary mode , that one error does not invalidate all that has gone before .</p>
    <p n="457">Let not too much , however , be expected from this system . The healthiest among us is not exempt from hereditary disease . The most symmetrical , athletic , and longlived is a being inexpressibly inferior to what he would have been , had not the unnatural habits of his ancestors accumulated for him a certain portion of malady and deformity . In the most perfect specimen of civilized man , something is still found wanting by the physiological critic . Can a return to nature , then , instantaneously eradicate predispositions that have been slowly taking root in the silence of innumerable ages ?— Indubitably not . All that I contend for is , that from the moment of the relinquishing all unnatural habits no new disease is generated ; and that the predisposition to hereditary maladies gradually perishes , for want of its accustomed supply . In cases of consumption , cancer , gout , asthma , and scrofula , such is the invariable tendency of a diet of vegetables and pure water .</p>
    <p n="458">Those who may be induced by these remarks to give the vegetable system a fair trial , should , in the first place , date the commencement of their practice from the moment of their conviction . All depends upon breaking through a pernicious habit resolutely and at once . Dr. Trotter asserts that no drunkard was ever reformed by gradually relinquishing his dram . ( See Trotter on the Nervous Temperament . ) Animal flesh , in its effects on the human stomach , is analogous to a dram . It is similar in the kind , though differing in the degree , of its operation . The proselyte to a pure diet must be warned to expect a temporary diminution of muscular strength . The subtraction of a powerful stimulus will suffice to account for this event . But it is only temporary , and is succeeded by an equable capability for exertion , far surpassing his former various and fluctuating strength . Above all , he will acquire an easiness of breathing , by which such exertion is performed , with a remarkable exemption from that painful and difficult panting now felt by almost every one after hastily climbing an ordinary mountain . He will be equally capable of bodily exertion , or mental application , after as before his simple meal . He will feel none of the narcotic effects of ordinary diet . Irritability , the direct consequence of exhausting stimuli , would yield to the power of natural and tranquil impulses . He will no longer pine under the lethargy of ennui , that unconquerable weariness of life , more to be dreaded than death itself . He will escape the epidemic madness , which broods over its own injurious notions of the Deity , and ‘ realizes the hell that priests and beldams feign . ’ Every man forms , as it were , his god from his own character ; to the divinity of one of simple habits no offering would be more acceptable than the happiness of his creatures . He would be incapable of hating or persecuting others for the love of God . He will find , moreover , a system of simple diet to be a system of perfect epicurism . He will no longer be incessantly occupied in blunting and destroying those organs from which he expects his gratification . The pleasures of taste to be derived from a dinner of potatoes , beans , peas , turnips , lettuces , with a dessert of apples , gooseberries , strawberries , currants , raspberries , and in winter , oranges , apples and pears , is far greater than is supposed . These who wait until they can eat this plain fare with the sauce of appetite will scarcely join with the hypocritical sensualist at a lord-mayor 's feast , who declaims against the pleasures of the table . Solomon kept a thousand concubines , and owned in despair that all was vanity . The man whose happiness is constituted by the society of one amiable woman would find some difficulty in sympathizing with the disappointment of this venerable debauchee .</p>
    <p n="459">I address myself not only to the young enthusiast , the ardent devotee of truth and virtue , the pure and passionate moralist , yet unvitiated by the contagion of the world . He will embrace a pure system , from its abstract truth , its beauty , its simplicity , and its promise of wide-extended benefit ; unless custom has turned poison into food , he will hate the brutal pleasures of the chase by instinct ; it will be a contemplation full of horror , and disappointment to his mind , that beings capable of the gentlest and most admirable sympathies should take delight in the death-pangs and last convulsions of dying animals . The elderly man , whose youth has been poisoned by intemperance , or who has lived with apparent moderation , and is afflicted with a wide variety of painful maladies , would find his account in a beneficial change produced without the risk of poisonous medicines . The mother , to whom the perpetual restlessness of disease and unaccountable deaths incident to her children are the causes of incurable unhappiness , would on this diet experience the satisfaction of beholding their perpetual healths and natural playfulness . ( See Mr. Newton 's book . His children are the most beautiful and healthy creatures it is possible to conceive ; the girls are perfect models for a sculptor ; their dispositions are also the most gentle and conciliating ; the judicious treatment , which they experience in other points , may be a correlative cause of this . In the first five years of their life , of 18 , 000 children that are born , 7 , 500 die of various diseases ; and how many more of those that survive are not rendered miserable by maladies not immediately mortal ? The quality and quantity of a woman 's milk are materially injured by the use of dead flesh . In an island near Iceland , where no vegetables are to be got , the children invariably die of tetanus before they are three weeks old , and the population is supplied from the mainland .— Sir G. Mackenzie 's “ History of Iceland ” . See also “ Emile ” , chapter 1 , pages 53 , 54 , 56 . ) The most valuable lives are daily destroyed by diseases that it is dangerous to palliate and impossible to cure by medicine . How much longer will man continue to pimp for the gluttony of Death , his most insidious , implacable , and eternal foe ?</p>

    <p n="461">NOTE ON QUEEN MAB , BY MRS. SHELLEY .</p>
    <p n="462">Shelley was eighteen when he wrote “ Queen Mab ” ; he never published it . When it was written , he had come to the decision that he was too young to be a ‘ judge of controversies ’ ; and he was desirous of acquiring ‘ that sobriety of spirit which is the characteristic of true heroism . ’ But he never doubted the truth or utility of his opinions ; and , in printing and privately distributing “ Queen Mab ” , he believed that he should further their dissemination , without occasioning the mischief either to others or himself that might arise from publication . It is doubtful whether he would himself have admitted it into a collection of his works . His severe classical taste , refined by the constant study of the Greek poets , might have discovered defects that escape the ordinary reader ; and the change his opinions underwent in many points would have prevented him from putting forth the speculations of his boyish days . But the poem is too beautiful in itself , and far too remarkable as the production of a boy of eighteen , to allow of its being passed over : besides that , having been frequently reprinted , the omission would be vain . In the former edition certain portions were left out , as shocking the general reader from the violence of their attack on religion . I myself had a painful feeling that such erasures might be looked upon as a mark of disrespect towards the author , and am glad to have the opportunity of restoring them . The notes also are reprinted entire — not because they are models of reasoning or lessons of truth , but because Shelley wrote them , and that all that a man at once so distinguished and so excellent ever did deserves to be preserved . The alterations his opinions underwent ought to be recorded , for they form his history .</p>
    <p n="463">A series of articles was published in the “ New Monthly Magazine ” during the autumn of the year 1832 , written by a man of great talent , a fellow-collegian and warm friend of Shelley : they describe admirably the state of his mind during his collegiate life . Inspired with ardour for the acquisition of knowledge , endowed with the keenest sensibility and with the fortitude of a martyr , Shelley came among his fellow-creatures , congregated for the purposes of education , like a spirit from another sphere ; too delicately organized for the rough treatment man uses towards man , especially in the season of youth , and too resolute in carrying out his own sense of good and justice , not to become a victim . To a devoted attachment to those he loved he added a determined resistance to oppression . Refusing to fag at Eton , he was treated with revolting cruelty by masters and boys : this roused instead of taming his spirit , and he rejected the duty of obedience when it was enforced by menaces and punishment . To aversion to the society of his fellow-creatures , such as he found them when collected together in societies , where one egged on the other to acts of tyranny , was joined the deepest sympathy and compassion ; while the attachment he felt for individuals , and the admiration with which he regarded their powers and their virtues , led him to entertain a high opinion of the perfectibility of human nature ; and he believed that all could reach the highest grade of moral improvement , did not the customs and prejudices of society foster evil passions and excuse evil actions .</p>
    <p n="464">The oppression which , trembling at every nerve yet resolute to heroism , it was his ill-fortune to encounter at school and at college , led him to dissent in all things from those whose arguments were blows , whose faith appeared to engender blame and hatred . ‘ During my existence , ’ he wrote to a friend in 1812 , ‘ I have incessantly speculated , thought , and read . ’ His readings were not always well chosen ; among them were the works of the French philosophers : as far as metaphysical argument went , he temporarily became a convert . At the same time , it was the cardinal article of his faith that , if men were but taught and induced to treat their fellows with love , charity , and equal rights , this earth would realize paradise . He looked upon religion , as it is professed , and above all practised , as hostile instead of friendly to the cultivation of those virtues which would make men brothers .</p>
    <p n="465">Can this be wondered at ? At the age of seventeen , fragile in health and frame , of the purest habits in morals , full of devoted generosity and universal kindness , glowing with ardour to attain wisdom , resolved at every personal sacrifice to do right , burning with a desire for affection and sympathy ,— he was treated as a reprobate , cast forth as a criminal .</p>
    <p n="466">The cause was that he was sincere ; that he believed the opinions which he entertained to be true . And he loved truth with a martyr 's love ; he was ready to sacrifice station and fortune , and his dearest affections , at its shrine . The sacrifice was demanded from , and made by , a youth of seventeen . It is a singular fact in the history of society in the civilized nations of modern times that no false step is so irretrievable as one made in early youth . Older men , it is true , when they oppose their fellows and transgress ordinary rules , carry a certain prudence or hypocrisy as a shield along with them . But youth is rash ; nor can it imagine , while asserting what it believes to be true , and doing what it believes to be right , that it should be denounced as vicious , and pursued as a criminal .</p>
    <p n="467">Shelley possessed a quality of mind which experience has shown me to be of the rarest occurrence among human beings : this was his UNWORLDLINESS . The usual motives that rule men , prospects of present or future advantage , the rank and fortune of those around , the taunts and censures , or the praise , of those who were hostile to him , had no influence whatever over his actions , and apparently none over his thoughts . It is difficult even to express the simplicity and directness of purpose that adorned him . Some few might be found in the history of mankind , and some one at least among his own friends , equally disinterested and scornful , even to severe personal sacrifices , of every baser motive . But no one , I believe , ever joined this noble but passive virtue to equal active endeavours for the benefit of his friends and mankind in general , and to equal power to produce the advantages he desired . The world 's brightest gauds and its most solid advantages were of no worth in his eyes , when compared to the cause of what he considered truth , and the good of his fellow-creatures . Born in a position which , to his inexperienced mind , afforded the greatest facilities to practise the tenets he espoused , he boldly declared the use he would make of fortune and station , and enjoyed the belief that he should materially benefit his fellow-creatures by his actions ; while , conscious of surpassing powers of reason and imagination , it is not strange that he should , even while so young , have believed that his written thoughts would tend to disseminate opinions which he believed conducive to the happiness of the human race .</p>
    <p n="468">If man were a creature devoid of passion , he might have said and done all this with quietness . But he was too enthusiastic , and too full of hatred of all the ills he witnessed , not to scorn danger . Various disappointments tortured , but could not tame , his soul . The more enmity he met , the more earnestly he became attached to his peculiar views , and hostile to those of the men who persecuted him .</p>
    <p n="469">He was animated to greater zeal by compassion for his fellow-creatures . His sympathy was excited by the misery with which the world is burning . He witnessed the sufferings of the poor , and was aware of the evils of ignorance . He desired to induce every rich man to despoil himself of superfluity , and to create a brotherhood of property and service , and was ready to be the first to lay down the advantages of his birth . He was of too uncompromising a disposition to join any party . He did not in his youth look forward to gradual improvement : nay , in those days of intolerance , now almost forgotten , it seemed as easy to look forward to the sort of millennium of freedom and brotherhood which he thought the proper state of mankind as to the present reign of moderation and improvement . Ill-health made him believe that his race would soon be run ; that a year or two was all he had of life . He desired that these years should be useful and illustrious . He saw , in a fervent call on his fellow-creatures to share alike the blessings of the creation , to love and serve each other , the noblest work that life and time permitted him . In this spirit he composed “ Queen Mab ” .</p>
    <p n="470">He was a lover of the wonderful and wild in literature , but had not fostered these tastes at their genuine sources — the romances and chivalry of the middle ages — but in the perusal of such German works as were current in those days . Under the influence of these he , at the age of fifteen , wrote two short prose romances of slender merit . The sentiments and language were exaggerated , the composition imitative and poor . He wrote also a poem on the subject of Ahasuerus — being led to it by a German fragment he picked up , dirty and torn , in Lincoln 's Inn Fields . This fell afterwards into other hands , and was considerably altered before it was printed . Our earlier English poetry was almost unknown to him . The love and knowledge of Nature developed by Wordsworth — the lofty melody and mysterious beauty of Coleridge 's poetry — and the wild fantastic machinery and gorgeous scenery adopted by Southey — composed his favourite reading ; the rhythm of “ Queen Mab ” was founded on that of “ Thalaba ” , and the first few lines bear a striking resemblance in spirit , though not in idea , to the opening of that poem . His fertile imagination , and ear tuned to the finest sense of harmony , preserved him from imitation . Another of his favourite books was the poem of “ Gebir ” by Walter Savage Landor . From his boyhood he had a wonderful facility of versification , which he carried into another language ; and his Latin school-verses were composed with an ease and correctness that procured for him prizes , and caused him to be resorted to by all his friends for help . He was , at the period of writing “ Queen Mab ” , a great traveller within the limits of England , Scotland , and Ireland . His time was spent among the loveliest scenes of these countries . Mountain and lake and forest were his home ; the phenomena of Nature were his favourite study . He loved to inquire into their causes , and was addicted to pursuits of natural philosophy and chemistry , as far as they could be carried on as an amusement . These tastes gave truth and vivacity to his descriptions , and warmed his soul with that deep admiration for the wonders of Nature which constant association with her inspired .</p>
    <p n="471">He never intended to publish “ Queen Mab ” as it stands ; but a few years after , when printing “ Alastor ” , he extracted a small portion which he entitled “ The Daemon of the World ” . In this he changed somewhat the versification , and made other alterations scarcely to be called improvements .</p>
    <p n="472">Some years after , when in Italy , a bookseller published an edition of “ Queen Mab ” as it originally stood . Shelley was hastily written to by his friends , under the idea that , deeply injurious as the mere distribution of the poem had proved , the publication might awaken fresh persecutions . At the suggestion of these friends he wrote a letter on the subject , printed in the “ Examiner ” newspaper — with which I close this history of his earliest work .</p>
    <p n="473">TO THE EDITOR OF THE ‘ EXAMINER . ’</p>
    <p n="474">‘ Sir ,</p>
    <p n="475">‘ Having heard that a poem entitled “ Queen Mab ” has been surreptitiously published in London , and that legal proceedings have been instituted against the publisher , I request the favour of your insertion of the following explanation of the affair , as it relates to me .</p>
    <p n="476">‘ A poem entitled “ Queen Mab ” was written by me at the age of eighteen , I daresay in a sufficiently intemperate spirit — but even then was not intended for publication , and a few copies only were struck off , to be distributed among my personal friends . I have not seen this production for several years . I doubt not but that it is perfectly worthless in point of literary composition ; and that , in all that concerns moral and political speculation , as well as in the subtler discriminations of metaphysical and religious doctrine , it is still more crude and immature . I am a devoted enemy to religious , political , and domestic oppression ; and I regret this publication , not so much from literary vanity , as because I fear it is better fitted to injure than to serve the sacred cause of freedom . I have directed my solicitor to apply to Chancery for an injunction to restrain the sale ; but , after the precedent of Mr. Southey 's “ Wat Tyler ” ( a poem written , I believe , at the same age , and with the same unreflecting enthusiasm ) , with little hope of success .</p>
    <p n="477">‘ Whilst I exonerate myself from all share in having divulged opinions hostile to existing sanctions , under the form , whatever it may be , which they assume in this poem , it is scarcely necessary for me to protest against the system of inculcating the truth of Christianity or the excellence of Monarchy , however true or however excellent they may be , by such equivocal arguments as confiscation and imprisonment , and invective and slander , and the insolent violation of the most sacred ties of Nature and society .</p>

    <p>TO DEATH . [ Published ( without title ) by Hogg , “ Life of Shelley ” , 1858 ; dated 1810 . Included ( under the title , “ To Death ” ) in the Esdaile manuscript book . ] Death ! where is thy victory ? To triumph whilst I die , To triumph whilst thine ebon wing Enfolds my shuddering soul ? O Death ! where is thy sting ? 5 Not when the tides of murder roll , When nations groan , that kings may bask in bliss , Death ! canst thou boast a victory such as this — When in his hour of pomp and power His blow the mightiest murderer gave , 10 Mid Nature 's cries the sacrifice Of millions to glut the grave ; When sunk the Tyrant Desolation 's slave ; Or Freedom 's life-blood streamed upon thy shrine ; Stern Tyrant , couldst thou boast a victory such as mine ? 15 To know in dissolution 's void That mortals ’ baubles sunk decay ; That everything , but Love , destroyed Must perish with its kindred clay ,— Perish Ambition 's crown , 20 Perish her sceptred sway : From Death 's pale front fades Pride 's fastidious frown . In Death 's damp vault the lurid fires decay , That Envy lights at heaven-born Virtue 's beam — That all the cares subside , 25 Which lurk beneath the tide Of life 's unquiet stream ;— Yes ! this is victory ! And on yon rock , whose dark form glooms the sky , To stretch these pale limbs , when the soul is fled ; 30 To baffle the lean passions of their prey , To sleep within the palace of the dead ! Oh ! not the King , around whose dazzling throne His countless courtiers mock the words they say , Triumphs amid the bud of glory blown , 35 As I in this cold bed , and faint expiring groan ! Tremble , ye proud , whose grandeur mocks the woe Which props the column of unnatural state ! You the plainings , faint and low , From Misery 's tortured soul that flow , 40 Shall usher to your fate . Tremble , ye conquerors , at whose fell command The war-fiend riots o'er a peaceful land ! You Desolation 's gory throng Shall bear from Victory along 45 To that mysterious strand .</p>

    <p n="519">1 . Hopes , that swell in youthful breasts , Live not through the waste of time ! Love 's rose a host of thorns invests ; Cold , ungenial is the clime , Where its honours blow . 5 Youth says , ‘ The purple flowers are mine , ’ Which die the while they glow .</p>
    <p n="520">2 . Dear the boon to Fancy given , Retracted whilst it 's granted : Sweet the rose which lives in Heaven , 10 Although on earth ‘ tis planted , Where its honours blow , While by earth 's slaves the leaves are riven Which die the while they glow .</p>
    <p n="521">3 . Age cannot Love destroy , 15 But perfidy can blast the flower , Even when in most unwary hour It blooms in Fancy 's bower . Age cannot Love destroy , But perfidy can rend the shrine 20 In which its vermeil splendours shine .</p>

    <p n="525">How eloquent are eyes ! Not the rapt poet 's frenzied lay When the soul 's wildest feelings stray Can speak so well as they . How eloquent are eyes ! 5 Not music 's most impassioned note On which Love 's warmest fervours float Like them bids rapture rise .</p>
    <p n="526">Love , look thus again ,— That your look may light a waste of years , 10 Darting the beam that conquers cares Through the cold shower of tears . Love , look thus again !</p>

    <p n="529">A Person complained that whenever he began to write , he never could arrange his ideas in grammatical order . Which occasion suggested the idea of the following lines :</p>
    <p n="530">1 . Here I sit with my paper , my pen and my ink , First of this thing , and that thing , and t'other thing think ; Then my thoughts come so pell-mell all into my mind , That the sense or the subject I never can find : This word is wrong placed ,— no regard to the sense , The present and future , instead of past tense , Then my grammar I want ; O dear ! what a bore , I think I shall never attempt to write more , With patience I then my thoughts must arraign , Have them all in due order like mutes in a train , 10 Like them too must wait in due patience and thought , Or else my fine works will all come to nought . My wit too 's so copious , it flows like a river , But disperses its waters on black and white never ; Like smoke it appears independent and free , 15 But ah luckless smoke ! it all passes like thee — Then at length all my patience entirely lost , My paper and pens in the fire are tossed ; But come , try again — you must never despair , Our Murray 's or Entick 's are not all so rare , 20 Implore their assistance — they 'll come to your aid , Perform all your business without being paid , They 'll tell you the present tense , future and past , Which should come first , and which should come last , This Murray will do — then to Entick repair , 25 To find out the meaning of any word rare . This they friendly will tell , and ne'er make you blush , With a jeering look , taunt , or an O fie ! tush ! Then straight all your thoughts in black and white put , Not minding the if 's , the be 's , and the but , 30 Then read it all over , see how it will run , How answers the wit , the retort , and the pun , Your writings may then with old Socrates vie , May on the same shelf with Demosthenes lie , May as Junius be sharp , or as Plato be sage . 35 The pattern or satire to all of the age ; But stop — a mad author I mean not to turn , Nor with thirst of applause does my heated brain burn , Sufficient that sense , wit , and grammar combined , My letters may make some slight food for the mind ; 40 That my thoughts to my friends I may freely impart , In all the warm language that flows from the heart . Hark ! futurity calls ! it loudly complains , It bids me step forward and just hold the reins , My excuse shall be humble , and faithful , and true , 45 Such as I fear can be made but by few — Of writers this age has abundance and plenty , Three score and a thousand , two millions and twenty , Three score of them wits who all sharply vie , To try what odd creature they best can belie , 50 A thousand are prudes who for CHARITY write , And fill up their sheets with spleen , envy , and spite [,] One million are bards , who to Heaven aspire , And stuff their works full of bombast , rant , and fire , T'other million are wags who in Grubstreet attend , 55 And just like a cobbler the old writings mend , The twenty are those who for pulpits indite , And pore over sermons all Saturday night . And now my good friends — who come after I mean , As I ne'er wore a cassock , or dined with a dean . 60 Or like cobblers at mending I never did try , Nor with poets in lyrics attempted to vie ; As for prudes these good souls I both hate and detest , So here I believe the matter must rest .— I 've heard your complaint — my answer I 've made , 65 And since to your calls all the tribute I 've paid , Adieu my good friend ; pray never despair , But grammar and sense and everything dare , Attempt but to write dashing , easy , and free , Then take out your grammar and pay him his fee , 70 Be not a coward , shrink not to a tense , But read it all over and make it out sense . What a tiresome girl !— pray soon make an end , Else my limited patience you 'll quickly expend . Well adieu , I no longer your patience will try — 75 So swift to the post now the letter shall fly .</p>

    <p n="533">TO MISS — — [ HARRIET GROVE ] FROM MISS — — [ ELIZABETH SHELLEY ] .</p>
    <p n="534">For your letter , dear — [ Hattie ] , accept my best thanks , Rendered long and amusing by virtue of franks , Though concise they would please , yet the longer the better , The more news that 's crammed in , more amusing the letter , All excuses of etiquette nonsense I hate , 5 Which only are fit for the tardy and late , As when converse grows flat , of the weather they talk , How fair the sun shines — a fine day for a walk , Then to politics turn , of Burdett 's reformation , One declares it would hurt , t'other better the nation , 10 Will ministers keep ? sure they 've acted quite wrong , The burden this is of each morning-call song . So — is going to — you say , I hope that success her great efforts will pay [—] That [ the Colonel ] will see her , be dazzled outright , 15 And declare he can n't bear to be out of her sight . Write flaming epistles with love 's pointed dart , Whose sharp little arrow struck right on his heart , Scold poor innocent Cupid for mischievous ways , He knows not how much to laud forth her praise , 20 That he neither eats , drinks or sleeps for her sake , And hopes her hard heart some compassion will take , A refusal would kill him , so desperate his flame , But he fears , for he knows she is not common game , Then praises her sense , wit , discernment and grace , 25 He 's not one that 's caught by a sly looking face , Yet that 's TOO divine — such a black sparkling eye , At the bare glance of which near a thousand will die ; Thus runs he on meaning but one word in ten , More than is meant by most such kind of men , 30 For they 're all alike , take them one with another , Begging pardon — with the exception of my brother . Of the drawings you mention much praise I have heard , Most opinion 's the same , with the difference of word , Some get a good name by the voice of the crowd , 35 Whilst to poor humble merit small praise is allowed , As in parliament votes , so in pictures a name , Oft determines a fate at the altar of fame .— So on Friday this City 's gay vortex you quit , And no longer with Doctors and Johnny cats sit — 40 Now your parcel 's arrived — [ Bysshe 's ] letter shall go , I hope all your joy may n't be turned into woe , Experience will tell you that pleasure is vain , When it promises sunshine how often comes rain . So when to fond hope every blessing is nigh , 45 How oft when we smile it is checked with a sigh , When Hope , gay deceiver , in pleasure is dressed , How oft comes a stroke that may rob us of rest . When we think ourselves safe , and the goal near at hand , Like a vessel just landing , we 're wrecked near the strand , 50 And though memory forever the sharp pang must feel , ‘ Tis our duty to bear , and our hardship to steel — May misfortunes dear Girl , ne'er thy happiness cloy , May thy days glide in peace , love , comfort and joy , May thy tears with soft pity for other woes flow , 55 Woes , which thy tender heart never may know , For hardships our own , God has taught us to bear , Though sympathy 's soul to a friend drops a tear . Oh dear ! what sentimental stuff have I written , Only fit to tear up and play with a kitten . 60 What sober reflections in the midst of this letter ! Jocularity sure would have suited much better ; But there are exceptions to all common rules , For this is a truth by all boys learned at schools . Now adieu my dear — [ Hattie ] I 'm sure I must tire , 65 For if I do , you may throw it into the fire , So accept the best love of your cousin and friend , Which brings this nonsensical rhyme to an end .</p>

    <p n="537">3 . SONG .</p>
    <p n="538">Cold , cold is the blast when December is howling , Cold are the damps on a dying man 's brow ,— Stern are the seas when the wild waves are rolling , And sad is the grave where a loved one lies low ; But colder is scorn from the being who loved thee , 5 More stern is the sneer from the friend who has proved thee , More sad are the tears when their sorrows have moved thee , Which mixed with groans anguish and wild madness flow —</p>
    <p n="539">And ah ! poor — has felt all this horror , Full long the fallen victim contended with fate : 10 ‘ Till a destitute outcast abandoned to sorrow , She sought her babe 's food at her ruiner 's gate — Another had charmed the remorseless betrayer , He turned laughing aside from her moans and her prayer , She said nothing , but wringing the wet from her hair , 15 Crossed the dark mountain side , though the hour it was late . ‘ Twas on the wild height of the dark Penmanmawr , That the form of the wasted — reclined ; She shrieked to the ravens that croaked from afar , And she sighed to the gusts of the wild sweeping wind .— 20 I call not yon rocks where the thunder peals rattle , I call not yon clouds where the elements battle , But thee , cruel — I call thee unkind ! ’ —</p>
    <p n="540">Then she wreathed in her hair the wild flowers of the mountain , And deliriously laughing , a garland entwined , 25 She bedewed it with tears , then she hung o'er the fountain , And leaving it , cast it a prey to the wind . ‘ Ah ! go , ’ she exclaimed , ‘ when the tempest is yelling , ‘ Tis unkind to be cast on the sea that is swelling , But I left , a pitiless outcast , my dwelling , 30 My garments are torn , so they say is my mind — ’</p>
    <p n="541">Not long lived —, but over her grave Waved the desolate form of a storm-blasted yew , Around it no demons or ghosts dare to rave , But spirits of peace steep her slumbers in dew . 35 Then stay thy swift steps mid the dark mountain heather , Though chill blow the wind and severe is the weather , For perfidy , traveller ! cannot bereave her , Of the tears , to the tombs of the innocent due .—</p>

    <p n="544">Come [ Harriet ] ! sweet is the hour , Soft Zephyrs breathe gently around , The anemone 's night-boding flower , Has sunk its pale head on the ground .</p>
    <p n="545">‘ Tis thus the world 's keenness hath torn , 5 Some mild heart that expands to its blast , ‘ Tis thus that the wretched forlorn , Sinks poor and neglected at last .—</p>
    <p n="546">The world with its keenness and woe , Has no charms or attraction for me , 10 Its unkindness with grief has laid low , The heart which is faithful to thee . The high trees that wave past the moon , As I walk in their umbrage with you , All declare I must part with you soon , 15 All bid you a tender adieu !—</p>
    <p n="547">Then [ Harriet ] ! dearest farewell , You and I love , may ne'er meet again ; These woods and these meadows can tell How soft and how sweet was the strain .— 20</p>

    <p n="551">Ask not the pallid stranger 's woe , With beating heart and throbbing breast , Whose step is faltering , weak , and slow , As though the body needed rest .—</p>
    <p n="552">Whose ‘ wildered eye no object meets , 5 Nor cares to ken a friendly glance , With silent grief his bosom beats ,— Now fixed , as in a deathlike trance .</p>
    <p n="553">Who looks around with fearful eye , And shuns all converse with man kind , 10 As though some one his griefs might spy , And soothe them with a kindred mind .</p>
    <p n="554">A friend or foe to him the same , He looks on each with equal eye ; The difference lies but in the name , 15 To none for comfort can he fly .—</p>
    <p n="555">‘ Twas deep despair , and sorrow 's trace , To him too keenly given , Whose memory , time could not efface — His peace was lodged in Heaven .— 20</p>
    <p n="556">He looks on all this world bestows , The pride and pomp of power , As trifles best for pageant shows Which vanish in an hour .</p>
    <p n="557">When torn is dear affection 's tie , 25 Sinks the soft heart full low ; It leaves without a parting sigh , All that these realms bestow .</p>

    <p n="560">SORROW .</p>
    <p n="561">To me this world 's a dreary blank , All hopes in life are gone and fled , My high strung energies are sank , And all my blissful hopes lie dead .—</p>
    <p n="562">The world once smiling to my view , 5 Showed scenes of endless bliss and joy ; The world I then but little knew , Ah ! little knew how pleasures cloy ;</p>
    <p n="563">All then was jocund , all was gay , No thought beyond the present hour , 10 I danced in pleasure 's fading ray , Fading alas ! as drooping flower .</p>
    <p n="564">Nor do the heedless in the throng , One thought beyond the morrow give [,] They court the feast , the dance , the song , 15 Nor think how short their time to live .</p>
    <p n="565">The heart that bears deep sorrow 's trace , What earthly comfort can console , It drags a dull and lengthened pace , ‘ Till friendly death its woes enroll .— 20</p>
    <p n="566">The sunken cheek , the humid eyes , E'en better than the tongue can tell ; In whose sad breast deep sorrow lies , Where memory 's rankling traces dwell .—</p>
    <p n="567">The rising tear , the stifled sigh , 25 A mind but ill at ease display , Like blackening clouds in stormy sky , Where fiercely vivid lightnings play .</p>
    <p n="568">Thus when souls ’ energy is dead , When sorrow dims each earthly view , 30 When every fairy hope is fled , We bid ungrateful world adieu .</p>

    <p n="572">And said I that all hope was fled , That sorrow and despair were mine , That each enthusiast wish was dead , Had sank beneath pale Misery 's shrine .—</p>
    <p n="573">Seest thou the sunbeam 's yellow glow , 5 That robes with liquid streams of light ; Yon distant Mountain 's craggy brow . And shows the rocks so fair ,— so bright —</p>
    <p n="574">Tis thus sweet expectation 's ray , In softer view shows distant hours , 10 And portrays each succeeding day , As dressed in fairer , brighter flowers ,—</p>
    <p n="575">The vermeil tinted flowers that blossom ; Are frozen but to bud anew , Then sweet deceiver calm my bosom , 15 Although thy visions be not true ,—</p>
    <p n="576">Yet true they are ,— and I 'll believe , Thy whisperings soft of love and peace , God never made thee to deceive , ‘ Tis sin that bade thy empire cease . 20</p>
    <p n="577">Yet though despair my life should gloom , Though horror should around me close , With those I love , beyond the tomb , Hope shows a balm for all my woes .</p>

    <p n="583">And may I support my husband 's years , May I soothe his dying pain , 10 And then may I dry my fast falling tears , And meet him in Heaven again .</p>

    <p n="587">Ah ! grasp the dire dagger and couch the fell spear , If vengeance and death to thy bosom be dear , The dastard shall perish , death 's torment shall prove , For fate and revenge are decreed from above .</p>
    <p n="588">Ah ! where is the hero , whose nerves strung by youth , 5 Will defend the firm cause of justice and truth ; With insatiate desire whose bosom shall swell , To give up the oppressor to judgement and Hell —</p>
    <p n="589">For him shall the fair one twine chaplets of bays , To him shall each warrior give merited praise , 10 And triumphant returned from the clangour of arms , He shall find his reward in his loved maiden 's charms .</p>
    <p n="590">In ecstatic confusion the warrior shall sip , The kisses that glow on his love 's dewy lip , And mutual , eternal , embraces shall prove , 15 The rewards of the brave are the transports of love .</p>

    <p n="594">See ! the wide wasting ruin extends all around , 5 Our ancestors ’ dwellings lie sunk on the ground , Our foes ride in triumph throughout our domains , And our mightiest heroes lie stretched on the plains .</p>
    <p n="595">Ah ! dead is the harp which was wont to give pleasure , Ah ! sunk is our sweet country 's rapturous measure , 10 But the war note is waked , and the clangour of spears , The dread yell of Sloghan yet sounds in our ears .</p>
    <p n="596">Ah ! where are the heroes ! triumphant in death , Convulsed they recline on the blood sprinkled heath , Or the yelling ghosts ride on the blast that sweeps by , 15 And ‘ my countrymen ! vengeance ! ’ incessantly cry .</p>

    <p n="619">Not so deep is his grief on his death couch reposing , When on the last vision his dim eyes are closing ! As the outcast whose love-raptured senses are losing , 15 The last tones of thy voice on the wild breeze that swell !</p>

    <p n="622">14 . SAINT EDMOND 'S EVE .</p>
    <p n="623">Oh ! did you observe the Black Canon pass , And did you observe his frown ? He goeth to say the midnight mass , In holy St. Edmond 's town .</p>
    <p n="624">He goeth to sing the burial chaunt , 5 And to lay the wandering sprite , Whose shadowy , restless form doth haunt , The Abbey 's drear aisle this night .</p>
    <p n="625">It saith it will not its wailing cease , ‘ Till that holy man come near , 10 ‘ Till he pour o'er its grave the prayer of peace , And sprinkle the hallowed tear .</p>
    <p n="626">The Canon 's horse is stout and strong The road is plain and fair , But the Canon slowly wends along , 15 And his brow is gloomed with care .</p>
    <p n="627">Who is it thus late at the Abbey-gate ? Sullen echoes the portal bell , It sounds like the whispering voice of fate , It sounds like a funeral knell . 20</p>
    <p n="628">The Canon his faltering knee thrice bowed , And his frame was convulsed with fear , When a voice was heard distinct and loud , ‘ Prepare ! for thy hour is near . ’</p>
    <p n="629">He crosses his breast , he mutters a prayer , 25 To Heaven he lifts his eye , He heeds not the Abbot 's gazing stare , Nor the dark Monks who murmured by .</p>
    <p n="630">Bare-headed he worships the sculptured saints That frown on the sacred walls , 30 His face it grows pale ,— he trembles , he faints , At the Abbot 's feet he falls .</p>
    <p n="631">And straight the father 's robe he kissed , Who cried , ‘ Grace dwells with thee , The spirit will fade like the morning mist , 35 At your benedicite .</p>
    <p n="632">‘ Now haste within ! the board is spread , Keen blows the air , and cold , The spectre sleeps in its earthy bed , ‘ Till St. Edmond 's bell hath tolled ,— 40</p>
    <p n="633">‘ Yet rest your wearied limbs to-night , You 've journeyed many a mile , To-morrow lay the wailing sprite , That shrieks in the moonlight aisle .</p>
    <p n="634">‘ Oh ! faint are my limbs and my bosom is cold , 45 Yet to-night must the sprite be laid , Yet to-night when the hour of horror 's told , Must I meet the wandering shade .</p>
    <p n="635">‘ Nor food , nor rest may now delay ,— For hark ! the echoing pile , 50 A bell loud shakes !— Oh haste away , O lead to the haunted aisle . ’</p>
    <p n="636">The torches slowly move before , The cross is raised on high , A smile of peace the Canon wore , 55 But horror dimmed his eye —</p>
    <p n="637">And now they climb the footworn stair , The chapel gates unclose , Now each breathed low a fervent prayer , And fear each bosom froze — 60</p>
    <p n="638">Now paused awhile the doubtful band And viewed the solemn scene ,— Full dark the clustered columns stand , The moon gleams pale between —</p>
    <p n="639">‘ Say father , say , what cloisters ’ gloom 65 Conceals the unquiet shade , Within what dark unhallowed tomb , The corse unblessed was laid . ’</p>
    <p n="640">‘ Through yonder drear aisle alone it walks , And murmurs a mournful plaint , 70 Of thee ! Black Canon , it wildly talks , And call on thy patron saint —</p>
    <p n="641">The pilgrim this night with wondering eyes , As he prayed at St. Edmond 's shrine , From a black marble tomb hath seen it rise , 75 And under yon arch recline . ’ —</p>
    <p n="642">‘ Oh ! say upon that black marble tomb , What memorial sad appears . ’ — ‘ Undistinguished it lies in the chancel 's gloom , No memorial sad it bears ’ — 80</p>
    <p n="643">The Canon his paternoster reads , His rosary hung by his side , Now swift to the chancel doors he leads , And untouched they open wide ,</p>
    <p n="644">Resistless , strange sounds his steps impel , 85 To approach to the black marble tomb , ‘ Oh ! enter , Black Canon , ’ a whisper fell , ‘ Oh ! enter , thy hour is come . ’</p>
    <p n="645">He paused , told his beads , and the threshold passed . Oh ! horror , the chancel doors close , 90 A loud yell was borne on the rising blast , And a deep , dying groan arose .</p>
    <p n="646">The Monks in amazement shuddering stand , They burst through the chancel 's gloom , From St. Edmond 's shrine , lo ! a skeleton 's hand , 95 Points to the black marble tomb .</p>
    <p n="647">Lo ! deeply engraved , an inscription blood red , In characters fresh and clear — ‘ The guilty Black Canon of Elmham 's dead , And his wife lies buried here ! ’ 100</p>
    <p n="648">In Elmham 's tower he wedded a Nun , To St. Edmond 's his bride he bore , On this eve her noviciate here was begun , And a Monk 's gray weeds she wore ;—</p>
    <p n="649">O ! deep was her conscience dyed with guilt , 105 Remorse she full oft revealed , Her blood by the ruthless Black Canon was spilt , And in death her lips he sealed ;</p>
    <p n="650">Her spirit to penance this night was doomed , ‘ Till the Canon atoned the deed , 110 Here together they now shall rest entombed , ‘ Till their bodies from dust are freed —</p>
    <p n="651">Hark ! a loud peal of thunder shakes the roof , Round the altar bright lightnings play , Speechless with horror the Monks stand aloof , 115 And the storm dies sudden away —</p>
    <p n="652">The inscription was gone ! a cross on the ground , And a rosary shone through the gloom , But never again was the Canon there found , Or the Ghost on the black marble tomb . 120</p>
    <p n="653">15 . REVENGE .</p>
    <p n="654">‘ Ah ! quit me not yet , for the wind whistles shrill , Its blast wanders mournfully over the hill , The thunder 's wild voice rattles madly above , You will not then , cannot then , leave me my love .— ’</p>
    <p n="655">I must dearest Agnes , the night is far gone — 5 I must wander this evening to Strasburg alone , I must seek the drear tomb of my ancestors ’ bones , And must dig their remains from beneath the cold stones .</p>
    <p n="656">‘ For the spirit of Conrad there meets me this night , And we quit not the tomb ‘ till dawn of the light , 10 And Conrad 's been dead just a month and a day ! So farewell dearest Agnes for I must away ,—</p>
    <p n="657">‘ He bid me bring with me what most I held dear , Or a month from that time should I lie on my bier , And I 'd sooner resign this false fluttering breath , 15 Than my Agnes should dread either danger or death ,</p>
    <p n="658">‘ And I love you to madness my Agnes I love , My constant affection this night will I prove , This night will I go to the sepulchre 's jaw Alone will I glut its all conquering maw ’ — 20</p>
    <p n="659">‘ No ! no loved Adolphus thy Agnes will share , In the tomb all the dangers that wait for you there , I fear not the spirit ,— I fear not the grave , My dearest Adolphus I 'd perish to save ’ —</p>
    <p n="660">‘ Nay seek not to say that thy love shall not go , 25 But spare me those ages of horror and woe , For I swear to thee here that I 'll perish ere day , If you go unattended by Agnes away ’ —</p>
    <p n="661">The night it was bleak the fierce storm raged around , The lightning 's blue fire-light flashed on the ground , 30 Strange forms seemed to flit ,— and howl tidings of fate , As Agnes advanced to the sepulchre gate .—</p>
    <p n="662">The youth struck the portal ,— the echoing sound Was fearfully rolled midst the tombstones around , The blue lightning gleamed o'er the dark chapel spire , 35 And tinged were the storm clouds with sulphurous fire .</p>
    <p n="663">Still they gazed on the tombstone where Conrad reclined , Yet they shrank at the cold chilling blast of the wind , When a strange silver brilliance pervaded the scene , And a figure advanced — tall in form — fierce in mien . 40</p>
    <p n="664">A mantle encircled his shadowy form , As light as a gossamer borne on the storm , Celestial terror sat throned in his gaze , Like the midnight pestiferous meteor 's blaze .—</p>
    <p n="665">SPIRIT : Thy father , Adolphus ! was false , false as hell , 45 And Conrad has cause to remember it well , He ruined my Mother , despised me his son , I quitted the world ere my vengeance was done .</p>
    <p n="666">I was nearly expiring — ‘ twas close of the day ,— A demon advanced to the bed where I lay , 50 He gave me the power from whence I was hurled , To return to revenge , to return to the world ,—</p>
    <p n="667">Now Adolphus I 'll seize thy best loved in my arms , I 'll drag her to Hades all blooming in charms , On the black whirlwind 's thundering pinion I 'll ride , 55 And fierce yelling fiends shall exult o'er thy bride —</p>
    <p n="668">He spoke , and extending his ghastly arms wide , Majestic advanced with a swift noiseless stride , He clasped the fair Agnes — he raised her on high , And cleaving the roof sped his way to the sky — 60</p>
    <p n="669">All was now silent ,— and over the tomb , Thicker , deeper , was swiftly extended a gloom , Adolphus in horror sank down on the stone , And his fleeting soul fled with a harrowing groan .</p>
    <p n="670">DECEMBER , 1809 .</p>
    <p n="671">16 . GHASTA OR , THE AVENGING DEMON !! !</p>
    <p n="672">The idea of the following tale was taken from a few unconnected German Stanzas .— The principal Character is evidently the Wandering Jew , and although not mentioned by name , the burning Cross on his forehead undoubtedly alludes to that superstition , so prevalent in the part of Germany called the Black Forest , where this scene is supposed to lie .</p>
    <p n="673">Hark ! the owlet flaps her wing , In the pathless dell beneath , Hark ! night ravens loudly sing , Tidings of despair and death .—</p>
    <p n="674">Horror covers all the sky , 5 Clouds of darkness blot the moon , Prepare ! for mortal thou must die , Prepare to yield thy soul up soon —</p>
    <p n="675">Fierce the tempest raves around , Fierce the volleyed lightnings fly , 10 Crashing thunder shakes the ground , Fire and tumult fill the sky .—</p>
    <p n="676">Hark ! the tolling village bell , Tells the hour of midnight come , Now can blast the powers of Hell , 15 Fiend-like goblins now can roam —</p>
    <p n="677">See ! his crest all stained with rain , A warrior hastening speeds his way , He starts , looks round him , starts again , And sighs for the approach of day . 20</p>
    <p n="678">See ! his frantic steed he reins , See ! he lifts his hands on high , Implores a respite to his pains , From the powers of the sky .—</p>
    <p n="679">He seeks an Inn , for faint from toil , 25 Fatigue had bent his lofty form , To rest his wearied limbs awhile , Fatigued with wandering and the storm .</p>
    <p n="680">... ...</p>
    <p n="681">Slow the door is opened wide — With trackless tread a stranger came , 30 His form Majestic , slow his stride , He sate , nor spake ,— nor told his name —</p>
    <p n="682">Terror blanched the warrior 's cheek , Cold sweat from his forehead ran , In vain his tongue essayed to speak ,— 35 At last the stranger thus began :</p>
    <p n="683">‘ Mortal ! thou that saw'st the sprite , Tell me what I wish to know , Or come with me before ‘ tis light , Where cypress trees and mandrakes grow . 40</p>
    <p n="684">‘ Fierce the avenging Demon 's ire , Fiercer than the wintry blast , Fiercer than the lightning 's fire , When the hour of twilight 's past ’ —</p>
    <p n="685">The warrior raised his sunken eye . 45 It met the stranger 's sullen scowl , ‘ Mortal ! Mortal ! thou must die , ’ In burning letters chilled his soul .</p>
    <p n="686">WARRIOR : Stranger ! whoso'er you are , I feel impelled my tale to tell — 50 Horrors stranger shalt thou hear , Horrors drear as those of Hell .</p>
    <p n="687">O'er my Castle silence reigned , Late the night and drear the hour , When on the terrace I observed , 55 A fleeting shadowy mist to lower .—</p>
    <p n="688">Light the cloud as summer fog , Which transient shuns the morning beam ; Fleeting as the cloud on bog , That hangs or on the mountain stream .— 60</p>
    <p n="689">Horror seized my shuddering brain , Horror dimmed my starting eye . In vain I tried to speak ,— In vain My limbs essayed the spot to fly —</p>
    <p n="690">At last the thin and shadowy form , 65 With noiseless , trackless footsteps came ,— Its light robe floated on the storm , Its head was bound with lambent flame .</p>
    <p n="691">In chilling voice drear as the breeze Which sweeps along th ’ autumnal ground , 70 Which wanders through the leafless trees , Or the mandrake 's groan which floats around .</p>
    <p n="692">‘ Thou art mine and I am thine , ‘ Till the sinking of the world , I am thine and thou art mine , 75 ‘ Till in ruin death is hurled —</p>
    <p n="693">‘ Strong the power and dire the fate , Which drags me from the depths of Hell , Breaks the tomb 's eternal gate , Where fiendish shapes and dead men yell , 80</p>
    <p n="694">‘ Haply I might ne'er have shrank From flames that rack the guilty dead , Haply I might ne'er have sank On pleasure 's flowery , thorny bed —</p>
    <p n="695">— ‘ But stay ! no more I dare disclose , 85 Of the tale I wish to tell , On Earth relentless were my woes , But fiercer are my pangs in Hell —</p>
    <p n="696">‘ Now I claim thee as my love , Lay aside all chilling fear , 90 My affection will I prove , Where sheeted ghosts and spectres are !</p>
    <p n="697">‘ For thou art mine , and I am thine , ‘ Till the dreaded judgement day , I am thine , and thou art mine — 95 Night is past — I must away . ’</p>
    <p n="698">Still I gazed , and still the form Pressed upon my aching sight , Still I braved the howling storm , When the ghost dissolved in night .— 100</p>
    <p n="699">Restless , sleepless fled the night , Sleepless as a sick man 's bed , When he sighs for morning light , When he turns his aching head ,—</p>
    <p n="700">Slow and painful passed the day . 105 Melancholy seized my brain , Lingering fled the hours away , Lingering to a wretch in pain .—</p>
    <p n="701">At last came night , ah ! horrid hour , Ah ! chilling time that wakes the dead , 110 When demons ride the clouds that lower , — The phantom sat upon my bed .</p>
    <p n="702">In hollow voice , low as the sound Which in some charnel makes its moan , What floats along the burying ground , 115 The phantom claimed me as her own .</p>
    <p n="703">Her chilling finger on my head , With coldest touch congealed my soul — Cold as the finger of the dead , Or damps which round a tombstone roll — 120</p>
    <p n="704">Months are passed in lingering round , Every night the spectre comes , With thrilling step it shakes the ground , With thrilling step it round me roams —</p>
    <p n="705">Stranger ! I have told to thee , 125 All the tale I have to tell — Stranger ! canst thou tell to me , How to ‘ scape the powers of Hell ?—</p>
    <p n="706">STRANGER : Warrior ! I can ease thy woes , Wilt thou , wilt thou , come with me — 130 Warrior ! I can all disclose , Follow , follow , follow me .</p>
    <p n="707">Yet the tempest 's duskiest wing , Its mantle stretches o'er the sky , Yet the midnight ravens sing , 135 ‘ Mortal ! Mortal ! thou must die . ’</p>
    <p n="708">At last they saw a river clear , That crossed the heathy path they trod , The Stranger 's look was wild and drear , The firm Earth shook beneath his nod — 140</p>
    <p n="709">He raised a wand above his head , He traced a circle on the plain , In a wild verse he called the dead , The dead with silent footsteps came .</p>
    <p n="710">A burning brilliance on his head , 145 Flaming filled the stormy air , In a wild verse he called the dead , The dead in motley crowd were there .—</p>
    <p n="711">‘ Ghasta ! Ghasta ! come along , Bring thy fiendish crowd with thee , 150 Quickly raise th ’ avenging Song , Ghasta ! Ghasta ! come to me . ’</p>
    <p n="712">Horrid shapes in mantles gray , Flit athwart the stormy night , ‘ Ghasta ! Ghasta ! come away , 155 Come away before ‘ tis light . ’</p>
    <p n="713">See ! the sheeted Ghost they bring , Yelling dreadful o'er the heath , Hark ! the deadly verse they sing , Tidings of despair and death ! 160</p>
    <p n="714">The yelling Ghost before him stands , See ! she rolls her eyes around , Now she lifts her bony hands , Now her footsteps shake the ground .</p>
    <p n="715">STRANGER : Phantom of Theresa say , 165 Why to earth again you came , Quickly speak , I must away ! Or you must bleach for aye in flame ,—</p>
    <p n="716">PHANTOM : Mighty one I know thee now , Mightiest power of the sky , 170 Know thee by thy flaming brow , Know thee by thy sparkling eye .</p>
    <p n="717">That fire is scorching ! Oh ! I came , From the caverned depth of Hell , My fleeting false Rodolph to claim , 175 Mighty one ! I know thee well .—</p>
    <p n="718">STRANGER : Ghasta ! seize yon wandering sprite , Drag her to the depth beneath , Take her swift , before ‘ tis light , Take her to the cells of death ! 180</p>
    <p n="719">Thou that heardst the trackless dead , In the mouldering tomb must lie , Mortal ! look upon my head , Mortal ! Mortal ! thou must die .</p>
    <p n="720">Of glowing flame a cross was there , 185 Which threw a light around his form , Whilst his lank and raven hair , Floated wild upon the storm .—</p>
    <p n="721">The warrior upwards turned his eyes , Gazed upon the cross of fire , 190 There sat horror and surprise , There sat God 's eternal ire .—</p>
    <p n="722">A shivering through the Warrior flew , Colder than the nightly blast , Colder than the evening dew , 195 When the hour of twilight 's past .—</p>
    <p n="723">Thunder shakes th ’ expansive sky , Shakes the bosom of the heath , ‘ Mortal ! Mortal ! thou must die ’ — The warrior sank convulsed in death . 200</p>

    <p n="748">3 .— SISTER ROSA : A BALLAD .</p>
    <p n="749">1 . The death-bell beats !— The mountain repeats The echoing sound of the knell ; And the dark Monk now Wraps the cowl round his brow , 5 As he sits in his lonely cell .</p>
    <p n="750">2 . And the cold hand of death Chills his shuddering breath , As he lists to the fearful lay Which the ghosts of the sky , 10 As they sweep wildly by , Sing to departed day . And they sing of the hour When the stern fates had power To resolve Rosa 's form to its clay . 15</p>
    <p n="751">3 . But that hour is past ; And that hour was the last Of peace to the dark Monk 's brain . Bitter tears , from his eyes , gushed silent and fast ; And he strove to suppress them in vain . 20</p>
    <p n="752">4 . Then his fair cross of gold he dashed on the floor , When the death-knell struck on his ear .— ‘ Delight is in store For her evermore ; But for me is fate , horror , and fear . ’ 25</p>
    <p n="753">5 . Then his eyes wildly rolled , When the death-bell tolled , And he raged in terrific woe . And he stamped on the ground ,— But when ceased the sound , 30 Tears again began to flow .</p>
    <p n="754">6 . And the ice of despair Chilled the wild throb of care , And he sate in mute agony still ; Till the night-stars shone through the cloudless air , 35 And the pale moonbeam slept on the hill .</p>
    <p n="755">7 . Then he knelt in his cell :— And the horrors of hell Were delights to his agonized pain , And he prayed to God to dissolve the spell , 40 Which else must for ever remain .</p>
    <p n="756">8 . And in fervent pray'r he knelt on the ground , Till the abbey bell struck One : His feverish blood ran chill at the sound : A voice hollow and horrible murmured around — 45 ‘ The term of thy penance is done ! ’</p>
    <p n="757">9 . Grew dark the night ; The moonbeam bright Waxed faint on the mountain high ; And , from the black hill , 50 Went a voice cold and still ,— ‘ Monk ! thou art free to die . ’</p>
    <p n="758">10 . Then he rose on his feet , And his heart loud did beat , And his limbs they were palsied with dread ; 55 Whilst the grave 's clammy dew O'er his pale forehead grew ; And he shuddered to sleep with the dead .</p>
    <p n="759">11 . And the wild midnight storm Raved around his tall form , 60 As he sought the chapel 's gloom : And the sunk grass did sigh To the wind , bleak and high , As he searched for the new-made tomb .</p>
    <p n="760">12 . And forms , dark and high , 65 Seemed around him to fly , And mingle their yells with the blast : And on the dark wall Half-seen shadows did fall , As enhorrored he onward passed . 70</p>
    <p n="761">13 . And the storm-fiends wild rave O'er the new-made grave , And dread shadows linger around . The Monk called on God his soul to save , And , in horror , sank on the ground . 75</p>
    <p n="762">14 . Then despair nerved his arm To dispel the charm , And he burst Rosa 's coffin asunder . And the fierce storm did swell More terrific and fell , 80 And louder pealed the thunder .</p>
    <p n="763">15 . And laughed , in joy , the fiendish throng , Mixed with ghosts of the mouldering dead : And their grisly wings , as they floated along , Whistled in murmurs dread . 85</p>
    <p n="764">16 . And her skeleton form the dead Nun reared Which dripped with the chill dew of hell . In her half-eaten eyeballs two pale flames appeared , And triumphant their gleam on the dark Monk glared , As he stood within the cell . 90</p>
    <p n="765">17 . And her lank hand lay on his shuddering brain ; But each power was nerved by fear .— ‘ I never , henceforth , may breathe again ; Death now ends mine anguished pain .— The grave yawns ,— we meet there . ’ 95</p>
    <p n="766">18 . And her skeleton lungs did utter the sound , So deadly , so lone , and so fell , That in long vibrations shuddered the ground ; And as the stern notes floated around , A deep groan was answered from hell .</p>

    <p n="770">2 . No cloud along the spangled air , 5 Is borne upon the evening breeze ; How solemn is the scene ! how fair The moonbeams rest upon the trees !</p>
    <p n="771">3 . Yon dark gray turret glimmers white , Upon it sits the mournful owl ; 10 Along the stillness of the night , Her melancholy shriekings roll .</p>
    <p n="772">4 . But not alone on Irvyne 's tower , The silver moonbeam pours her ray ; It gleams upon the ivied bower , 15 It dances in the cascade 's spray .</p>
    <p n="773">5 . ‘ Ah ! why do dark'ning shades conceal The hour , when man must cease to be ? Why may not human minds unveil The dim mists of futurity ?— 20</p>

    <p n="777">1 . How stern are the woes of the desolate mourner , As he bends in still grief o'er the hallowed bier , As enanguished he turns from the laugh of the scorner , And drops , to Perfection 's remembrance , a tear ; When floods of despair down his pale cheek are streaming , 5 When no blissful hope on his bosom is beaming , Or , if lulled for awhile , soon he starts from his dreaming , And finds torn the soft ties to affection so dear .</p>
    <p n="778">2 . Ah ! when shall day dawn on the night of the grave , Or summer succeed to the winter of death ? 10 Rest awhile , hapless victim , and Heaven will save The spirit , that faded away with the breath . Eternity points in its amaranth bower , Where no clouds of fate o'er the sweet prospect lower , Unspeakable pleasure , of goodness the dower , 15 When woe fades away like the mist of the heath .</p>

    <p n="780">6 .— THE DROWNED LOVER .</p>
    <p n="781">1 . Ah ! faint are her limbs , and her footstep is weary , Yet far must the desolate wanderer roam ; Though the tempest is stern , and the mountain is dreary , She must quit at deep midnight her pitiless home . I see her swift foot dash the dew from the whortle , 5 As she rapidly hastes to the green grove of myrtle ; And I hear , as she wraps round her figure the kirtle , ‘ Stay thy boat on the lake ,— dearest Henry , I come . ’</p>
    <p n="782">2 . High swelled in her bosom the throb of affection , As lightly her form bounded over the lea , 10 And arose in her mind every dear recollection ; ‘ I come , dearest Henry , and wait but for thee . ’ How sad , when dear hope every sorrow is soothing , When sympathy 's swell the soft bosom is moving , And the mind the mild joys of affection is proving , 15 Is the stern voice of fate that bids happiness flee !</p>
    <p n="783">3 . Oh ! dark lowered the clouds on that horrible eve , And the moon dimly gleamed through the tempested air ; Oh ! how could fond visions such softness deceive ? Oh ! how could false hope rend , a bosom so fair ? 20 Thy love 's pallid corse the wild surges are laving , O'er his form the fierce swell of the tempest is raving ; But , fear not , parting spirit ; thy goodness is saving , In eternity 's bowers , a seat for thee there .</p>

The first I found with no title , and have left it so . It is intimately connected with the dearest interests of universal happiness ; and much as we may deplore the fatal and enthusiastic tendency which the ideas of this poor female had acquired , we cannot fail to pay the tribute of unequivocal regret to the departed memory of genius , which , had it been rightly organized , would have made that intellect , which has since become the victim of frenzy and despair , a most brilliant ornament to society .</p>
    <p n="790">In case the sale of these Fragments evinces that the public have any curiosity to be presented with a more copious collection of my unfortunate Aunt 's poems , I have other papers in my possession which shall , in that case , be subjected to their notice . It may be supposed they require much arrangement ; but I send the following to the press in the same state in which they came into my possession . J. F .</p>
    <p n="791">WAR .</p>
    <p n="792">Ambition , power , and avarice , now have hurled Death , fate , and ruin , on a bleeding world . See ! on yon heath what countless victims lie , Hark ! what loud shrieks ascend through yonder sky ; Tell then the cause , ‘ tis sure the avenger 's rage 5 Has swept these myriads from life 's crowded stage : Hark to that groan , an anguished hero dies , He shudders in death 's latest agonies ; Yet does a fleeting hectic flush his cheek , Yet does his parting breath essay to speak — 10 ‘ Oh God ! my wife , my children — Monarch thou For whose support this fainting frame lies low ; For whose support in distant lands I bleed , Let his friends ’ welfare be the warrior 's meed . He hears me not — ah ! no — kings cannot hear , 15 For passion 's voice has dulled their listless ear . To thee , then , mighty God , I lift my moan , Thou wilt not scorn a suppliant 's anguished groan . Oh ! now I die — but still is death 's fierce pain — God hears my prayer — we meet , we meet again . ’ 20 He spake , reclined him on death 's bloody bed , And with a parting groan his spirit fled . Oppressors of mankind to YOU we owe The baleful streams from whence these miseries flow ; For you how many a mother weeps her son , 25 Snatched from life 's course ere half his race was run ! For you how many a widow drops a tear , In silent anguish , on her husband 's bier ! ‘ Is it then Thine , Almighty Power , ’ she cries , ‘ Whence tears of endless sorrow dim these eyes ? 30 Is this the system which Thy powerful sway , Which else in shapeless chaos sleeping lay , Formed and approved ?— it cannot be — but oh ! Forgive me , Heaven , my brain is warped by woe . ’ ‘ Tis not — He never bade the war-note swell , 35 He never triumphed in the work of hell — Monarchs of earth ! thine is the baleful deed , Thine are the crimes for which thy subjects bleed . Ah ! when will come the sacred fated time , When man unsullied by his leaders ’ crime , 40 Despising wealth , ambition , pomp , and pride , Will stretch him fearless by his foe-men 's side ? Ah ! when will come the time , when o'er the plain No more shall death and desolation reign ? When will the sun smile on the bloodless field , 45 And the stern warrior 's arm the sickle wield ? Not whilst some King , in cold ambition 's dreams , Plans for the field of death his plodding schemes ; Not whilst for private pique the public fall , And one frail mortal 's mandate governs all . 50 Swelled with command and mad with dizzying sway ; Who sees unmoved his myriads fade away . Careless who lives or dies — so that he gains Some trivial point for which he took the pains . What then are Kings ?— I see the trembling crowd , 55 I hear their fulsome clamours echoed loud ; Their stern oppressor pleased appears awhile , But April 's sunshine is a Monarch 's smile — Kings are but dust — the last eventful day Will level all and make them lose their sway ; 60 Will dash the sceptre from the Monarch 's hand , And from the warrior 's grasp wrest the ensanguined brand . Oh ! Peace , soft Peace , art thou for ever gone , Is thy fair form indeed for ever flown ? And love and concord hast thou swept away , 65 As if incongruous with thy parted sway ? Alas , I fear thou hast , for none appear . Now o'er the palsied earth stalks giant Fear , With War , and Woe , and Terror , in his train ;— List'ning he pauses on the embattled plain , 70 Then speeding swiftly o'er the ensanguined heath , Has left the frightful work to Hell and Death . See ! gory Ruin yokes his blood-stained car , He scents the battle 's carnage from afar ; Hell and Destruction mark his mad career , 75 He tracks the rapid step of hurrying Fear ; Whilst ruined towns and smoking cities tell , That thy work , Monarch , is the work of Hell . ‘ It is thy work ! ’ I hear a voice repeat , Shakes the broad basis of thy bloodstained seat ; 80 And at the orphan 's sigh , the widow 's moan , Totters the fabric of thy guilt-stained throne — ‘ It is thy work , O Monarch ; ’ now the sound Fainter and fainter , yet is borne around , Yet to enthusiast ears the murmurs tell 85 That Heaven , indignant at the work of Hell , Will soon the cause , the hated cause remove , Which tears from earth peace , innocence , and love .</p>

    <p n="794">FRAGMENT : SUPPOSED TO BE AN EPITHALAMIUM OF FRANCIS RAVAILLAC AND CHARLOTTE CORDAY .</p>
    <p n="795">‘ Tis midnight now — athwart the murky air , Dank lurid meteors shoot a livid gleam ; From the dark storm-clouds flashes a fearful glare , It shows the bending oak , the roaring stream .</p>
    <p n="796">I pondered on the woes of lost mankind , 5 I pondered on the ceaseless rage of Kings ; My rapt soul dwelt upon the ties that bind The mazy volume of commingling things , When fell and wild misrule to man stern sorrow brings .</p>
    <p n="797">I heard a yell — it was not the knell , 10 When the blasts on the wild lake sleep , That floats on the pause of the summer gale 's swell , O'er the breast of the waveless deep .</p>
    <p n="798">I thought it had been death 's accents cold That bade me recline on the shore ; 15 I laid mine hot head on the surge-beaten mould , And thought to breathe no more .</p>
    <p n="799">But a heavenly sleep That did suddenly steep In balm my bosom 's pain , 20 Pervaded my soul , And free from control , Did mine intellect range again .</p>
    <p n="800">Methought enthroned upon a silvery cloud , Which floated mid a strange and brilliant light ; 25 My form upborne by viewless aether rode , And spurned the lessening realms of earthly night . What heavenly notes burst on my ravished ears , What beauteous spirits met my dazzled eye ! Hark ! louder swells the music of the spheres , 30 More clear the forms of speechless bliss float by , And heavenly gestures suit aethereal melody .</p>
    <p n="801">But fairer than the spirits of the air , More graceful than the Sylph of symmetry , Than the enthusiast 's fancied love more fair , 35 Were the bright forms that swept the azure sky . Enthroned in roseate light , a heavenly band Strewed flowers of bliss that never fade away ; They welcome virtue to its native land , And songs of triumph greet the joyous day 40 When endless bliss the woes of fleeting life repay .</p>
    <p n="802">Congenial minds will seek their kindred soul , E'en though the tide of time has rolled between ; They mock weak matter 's impotent control , And seek of endless life the eternal scene . 45 At death 's vain summons THIS will never die , In Nature 's chaos THIS will not decay — These are the bands which closely , warmly , tie Thy soul , O Charlotte , ‘ yond this chain of clay , To him who thine must be till time shall fade away . 50</p>
    <p n="803">Yes , Francis ! thine was the dear knife that tore A tyrant 's heart-strings from his guilty breast , Thine was the daring at a tyrant 's gore , To smile in triumph , to contemn the rest ; And thine , loved glory of thy sex ! to tear 55 From its base shrine a despot 's haughty soul , To laugh at sorrow in secure despair , To mock , with smiles , life 's lingering control , And triumph mid the griefs that round thy fate did roll .</p>
    <p n="804">Yes ! the fierce spirits of the avenging deep 60 With endless tortures goad their guilty shades . I see the lank and ghastly spectres sweep Along the burning length of yon arcades ; And I see Satan stalk athwart the plain ; He hastes along the burning soil of Hell . 65 ‘ Welcome , ye despots , to my dark domain , With maddening joy mine anguished senses swell To welcome to their home the friends I love so well . ’</p>
    <p n="805">...</p>
    <p n="806">Hark ! to those notes , how sweet , how thrilling sweet They echo to the sound of angels ’ feet . 70</p>
    <p n="807">...</p>
    <p n="808">Oh haste to the bower where roses are spread , For there is prepared thy nuptial bed . Oh haste — hark ! hark !— they 're gone .</p>
    <p n="809">...</p>
    <p n="810">CHORUS OF SPIRITS : Stay , ye days of contentment and joy , Whilst love every care is erasing , 75 Stay ye pleasures that never can cloy , And ye spirits that can never cease pleasing .</p>
    <p n="811">And if any soft passion be near , Which mortals , frail mortals , can know , Let love shed on the bosom a tear , 80 And dissolve the chill ice-drop of woe .</p>
    <p n="812">SYMPHONY .</p>
    <p n="813">FRANCIS : ‘ Soft , my dearest angel , stay , Oh ! you suck my soul away ; Suck on , suck on , I glow , I glow ! Tides of maddening passion roll , 85 And streams of rapture drown my soul . Now give me one more billing kiss , Let your lips now repeat the bliss , Endless kisses steal my breath , No life can equal such a death . ’ 90</p>
    <p n="814">CHARLOTTE : ‘ Oh ! yes I will kiss thine eyes so fair , And I will clasp thy form ; Serene is the breath of the balmy air , But I think , love , thou feelest me warm And I will recline on thy marble neck 95 Till I mingle into thee ; And I will kiss the rose on thy cheek , And thou shalt give kisses to me . For here is no morn to flout our delight , Oh ! dost thou not joy at this ? 100 And here we may lie an endless night , A long , long night of bliss . ’</p>
    <p n="815">Spirits ! when raptures move , Say what it is to love , When passion 's tear stands on the cheek , 105 When bursts the unconscious sigh ; And the tremulous lips dare not speak What is told by the soul-felt eye . But what is sweeter to revenge 's ear Than the fell tyrant 's last expiring yell ? 110 Yes ! than love 's sweetest blisses ‘ tis more dear To drink the floatings of a despot 's knell . I wake — ‘ tis done — ‘ tis over .</p>
    <p n="816">NOTE : 66 ye ] thou 1810 .</p>
    <p n="817">DESPAIR .</p>
    <p n="818">And canst thou mock mine agony , thus calm In cloudless radiance , Queen of silver night ? Can you , ye flow'rets , spread your perfumed balm Mid pearly gems of dew that shine so bright ? And you wild winds , thus can you sleep so still 5 Whilst throbs the tempest of my breast so high ? Can the fierce night-fiends rest on yonder hill , And , in the eternal mansions of the sky , Can the directors of the storm in powerless silence lie ?</p>
    <p n="819">Hark ! I hear music on the zephyr 's wing , 10 Louder it floats along the unruffled sky ; Some fairy sure has touched the viewless string — Now faint in distant air the murmurs die . Awhile it stills the tide of agony . Now — now it loftier swells — again stern woe 15 Arises with the awakening melody . Again fierce torments , such as demons know , In bitterer , feller tide , on this torn bosom flow .</p>
    <p n="820">Arise ye sightless spirits of the storm , Ye unseen minstrels of the aereal song , 20 Pour the fierce tide around this lonely form , And roll the tempest 's wildest swell along . Dart the red lightning , wing the forked flash , Pour from thy cloud-formed hills the thunder 's roar ; Arouse the whirlwind — and let ocean dash 25 In fiercest tumult on the rocking shore ,— Destroy this life or let earth 's fabric be no more .</p>
    <p n="821">Yes ! every tie that links me here is dead ; Mysterious Fate , thy mandate I obey , Since hope and peace , and joy , for aye are fled , 30 I come , terrific power , I come away . Then o'er this ruined soul let spirits of Hell , In triumph , laughing wildly , mock its pain ; And though with direst pangs mine heart-strings swell , I 'll echo back their deadly yells again , 35 Cursing the power that ne'er made aught in vain .</p>
    <p n="822">FRAGMENT .</p>
    <p n="823">Yes ! all is past — swift time has fled away , Yet its swell pauses on my sickening mind ; How long will horror nerve this frame of clay ? I 'm dead , and lingers yet my soul behind . Oh ! powerful Fate , revoke thy deadly spell , 5 And yet that may not ever , ever be , Heaven will not smile upon the work of Hell ; Ah ! no , for Heaven cannot smile on me ; Fate , envious Fate , has sealed my wayward destiny .</p>
    <p n="824">I sought the cold brink of the midnight surge , 10 I sighed beneath its wave to hide my woes , The rising tempest sung a funeral dirge , And on the blast a frightful yell arose . Wild flew the meteors o'er the maddened main , Wilder did grief athwart my bosom glare ; 15 Stilled was the unearthly howling , and a strain , Swelled mid the tumult of the battling air , ‘ Twas like a spirit 's song , but yet more soft and fair .</p>
    <p n="825">I met a maniac — like he was to me , I said — ‘ Poor victim , wherefore dost thou roam ? 20 And canst thou not contend with agony , That thus at midnight thou dost quit thine home ? ’ ‘ Ah there she sleeps : cold is her bloodless form , And I will go to slumber in her grave ; And then our ghosts , whilst raves the maddened storm , 25 Will sweep at midnight o'er the wildered wave ; Wilt thou our lowly beds with tears of pity lave ? ’</p>
    <p n="826">‘ Ah ! no , I cannot shed the pitying tear , This breast is cold , this heart can feel no more — But I can rest me on thy chilling bier , 30 Can shriek in horror to the tempest 's roar . ’</p>
    <p n="827">THE SPECTRAL HORSEMAN .</p>
    <p n="828">What was the shriek that struck Fancy 's ear As it sate on the ruins of time that is past ? Hark ! it floats on the fitful blast of the wind , And breathes to the pale moon a funeral sigh . It is the Benshie 's moan on the storm , 5 Or a shivering fiend that thirsting for sin , Seeks murder and guilt when virtue sleeps , Winged with the power of some ruthless king , And sweeps o'er the breast of the prostrate plain . It was not a fiend from the regions of Hell 10 That poured its low moan on the stillness of night : It was not a ghost of the guilty dead , Nor a yelling vampire reeking with gore ; But aye at the close of seven years ’ end , That voice is mixed with the swell of the storm , 15 And aye at the close of seven years ’ end , A shapeless shadow that sleeps on the hill Awakens and floats on the mist of the heath . It is not the shade of a murdered man , Who has rushed uncalled to the throne of his God , 20 And howls in the pause of the eddying storm . This voice is low , cold , hollow , and chill , ‘ Tis not heard by the ear , but is felt in the soul . ‘ Tis more frightful far than the death-daemon 's scream , Or the laughter of fiends when they howl o'er the corpse 25 Of a man who has sold his soul to Hell . It tells the approach of a mystic form , A white courser bears the shadowy sprite ; More thin they are than the mists of the mountain , When the clear moonlight sleeps on the waveless lake . 30 More pale HIS cheek than the snows of Nithona , When winter rides on the northern blast , And howls in the midst of the leafless wood . Yet when the fierce swell of the tempest is raving , And the whirlwinds howl in the caves of Inisfallen , 35 Still secure mid the wildest war of the sky , The phantom courser scours the waste , And his rider howls in the thunder 's roar . O'er him the fierce bolts of avenging Heaven Pause , as in fear , to strike his head . 40 The meteors of midnight recoil from his figure , Yet the ‘ wildered peasant , that oft passes by , With wonder beholds the blue flash through his form : And his voice , though faint as the sighs of the dead , The startled passenger shudders to hear , 45 More distinct than the thunder 's wildest roar . Then does the dragon , who , chained in the caverns To eternity , curses the champion of Erin , Moan and yell loud at the lone hour of midnight , And twine his vast wreaths round the forms of the daemons ; 50 Then in agony roll his death-swimming eyeballs , Though ‘ wildered by death , yet never to die ! Then he shakes from his skeleton folds the nightmares , Who , shrieking in agony , seek the couch Of some fevered wretch who courts sleep in vain ; 55 Then the tombless ghosts of the guilty dead In horror pause on the fitful gale . They float on the swell of the eddying tempest , And scared seek the caves of gigantic ... Where their thin forms pour unearthly sounds 60 On the blast that sweets the breast of the lake , And mingles its swell with the moonlight air .</p>
    <p n="829">MELODY TO A SCENE OF FORMER TIMES .</p>
    <p n="830">Art thou indeed forever gone , Forever , ever , lost to me ? Must this poor bosom beat alone , Or beat at all , if not for thee ? Ah ! why was love to mortals given , 5 To lift them to the height of Heaven , Or dash them to the depths of Hell ? Yet I do not reproach thee , dear ! Ah , no ! the agonies that swell This panting breast , this frenzied brain , 10 Might wake my — ‘ s slumb'ring tear . Oh ! Heaven is witness I did love , And Heaven does know I love thee still , Does know the fruitless sick'ning thrill , When reason 's judgement vainly strove 15 To blot thee from my memory ; But which might never , never be . Oh ! I appeal to that blest day When passion 's wildest ecstasy Was coldness to the joys I knew , 20 When every sorrow sunk away . Oh ! I had never lived before , But now those blisses are no more . And now I cease to live again , I do not blame thee , love ; ah , no ! 25 The breast that feels this anguished woe . Throbs for thy happiness alone . Two years of speechless bliss are gone , I thank thee , dearest , for the dream . ‘ Tis night — what faint and distant scream 30 Comes on the wild and fitful blast ? It moans for pleasures that are past , It moans for days that are gone by . Oh ! lagging hours , how slow you fly ! I see a dark and lengthened vale , 35 The black view closes with the tomb ; But darker is the lowering gloom That shades the intervening dale . In visioned slumber for awhile I seem again to share thy smile , 40 I seem to hang upon thy tone . Again you say , ‘ Confide in me , For I am thine , and thine alone , And thine must ever , ever be . ’ But oh ! awak'ning still anew , 45 Athwart my enanguished senses flew A fiercer , deadlier agony !</p>
