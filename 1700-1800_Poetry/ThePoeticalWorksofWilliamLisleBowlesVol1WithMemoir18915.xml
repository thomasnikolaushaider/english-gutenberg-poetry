    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">A Ninth Edition of the following Poems having been called for by the public , the author is induced to say a few words , particularly concerning those which , under the name of Sonnets , describe his personal feelings .</p>
    <p n="2">They can be considered in no other light than as exhibiting occasional reflections which naturally arose in his mind , chiefly during various excursions , undertaken to relieve , at the time , depression of spirits . They were , therefore , in general , suggested by the scenes before them ; and wherever such scenes appeared to harmonise with his disposition at the moment , the sentiments were involuntarily prompted .</p>
   </div>
   <titlePage>
    <docImprint>Numberless poetical trifles of the same kind have occurred to him , when perhaps , in his solitary rambles , he has been “ chewing the cud of sweet and bitter fancy ; ” but they have been forgotten as he left the places which gave rise to them ; and the greater part of those originally committed to the press were written down , for the first time , from memory . This is nothing to the public ; but it may serve in some measure to obviate the common remark on melancholy poetry , that it has been very often gravely composed , when possibly the heart of the writer had very little share in the distress he chose to describe . But there is a great difference between natural and fabricated feelings , even in poetry . To which of these two characters the poems before the reader belong , the author leaves those who have felt sensations of sorrow to judge . They who know him , know the occasions of them to have been real ; to the public he might only mention the sudden death of a deserving young woman , with whom , ... Sperabat longos heu ! ducere soles , Et fido acclinis consenuisse sinu .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>DONHEAD , April<date>1805</date>.<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>The early editions of these Sonnets ,<date>1791</date>, were dedicated to the Reverend Newton Ogle , D. D ., Dean of Winchester .</docImprint>

   <div type="introduction">
    <head>INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837 .</head>
    <p n="3">To account for the variations which may be remarked in this last edition of my Sonnets , from that which was first published fifty years ago , it may be proper to state , that to the best of my recollection , they now appear nearly as they were originally composed in my solitary hours ; when , in youth a wanderer among distant scenes , I sought forgetfulness of the first disappointment in early affections .</p>
    <p n="4">Delicacy even now , though the grave has long closed over the beloved object , would forbid entering on a detail of the peculiar circumstances in early life , and the anguish which occasioned these poetical meditations . In fact , I never thought of writing them down at the time , and many had escaped my recollection ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>but three years after my return to England , on my way to the banks of Cherwell , where</p>
    <p n="5">“ I bade the pipe farewell , and that sad lay Whose music , on my melancholy way , I wooed , ”</p>
    <p n="6">passing through Bath , I wrote down all I could recollect of these effusions , most elaborately mending the versification from the natural flow of music in which they occurred to me , and having thus corrected and written them out , took them myself to the late Mr Cruttwell , with the name of “ Fourteen Sonnets , written chiefly on Picturesque Spots during a Journey . ”</p>
    <p n="7">I had three times knocked at this amiable printer 's door , whose kind smile I still recollect ; and at last , with much hesitation , ventured to unfold my message ; it was to inquire whether he would give any thing for “ Fourteen Sonnets , ” to be published with or without the name .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>He at once declined the purchase , and informed me he doubted very much whether the publication would repay the expense of printing , which would come to about five pounds . It was at last determined one hundred copies , in quarto , should be published as a kind of “ forlorn hope ; ” and these “ Fourteen Sonnets ” I left to their fate and thought no more of getting rich by poetry ! In fact , I owed the most I ever owed at Oxford , at this time , namely , seventy pounds ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>and knowing my father 's large family and trying circumstances , and those of my poor mother , I shrunk from asking more money when I left home , and went back with a heavy heart to Oxford , under the conscious weight , that my poetic scheme failing , I had no means of paying Parsons , the mercer 's , bill ! This was the origin of the publication .</p>
    <p n="8">As this plain account is so connected with whatever may be my name in criticism and poetry , it is hoped it will be pardoned .</p>
   </div>
   <titlePage>
    <docImprint>All thoughts of succeeding as a poet were now abandoned ; but , half a year afterwards , I received a letter from the printer informing me that the hundred copies were all sold , adding , that if I had published FIVE HUNDRED copies , he had no doubt they would have been sold also . This , in my then situation , my father now dead , and my mother a widow with seven children , and with a materially reduced income ( from the loss of the rectories of Uphill and Brean in Somerset ) , was gratifying indeed ; all my golden dreams of poetical success were renewed ;— the number of the sonnets first published was increased , and five hundred copies , by the congratulating printer , with whose family I have lived in kindest amity from that hour , were recommended to issue from the press of the editor of the Bath Chronicle . But this was not all , the five hundred copies were sold to great advantage , for it was against my will that five hundred copies should be printed , till the printer told me he would take the risk on himself , on the usual terms , at that time , of bookseller and author . Soon afterwards , it was agreed that seven hundred and fifty copies should be printed , in a smaller and elegant size . I had received Coleridge 's warm testimony ; but soon after this third edition came out , my friend , Mr Cruttwell , the printer , wrote a letter saying that two young gentlemen , strangers , one a particularly handsome and pleasing youth , lately from Westminster School , and both literary and intelligent , spoke in high commendation of my volume , and if I recollect right , expressed a desire to have some poems printed in the same type and form . Who these young men were I knew not at the time , but the communication of the circumstance was to me most gratifying ; and how much more gratifying , when , from one of them , after he himself had achieved the fame of one of the most virtuous and eloquent of the writers in his generation , I received a first visit at my parsonage in Wiltshire upwards of forty years afterwards ! It was ROBERT SOUTHEY . We parted in my garden last year , when stealing time and sorrow had marked his still manly , but most interesting countenance .<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>— Therefore , TO ROBERT SOUTHEY , WHO HAS EXHIBITED IN HIS PROSE WORKS , AS IN HIS LIFE , THE PURITY AND VIRTUES OF ADDISON AND LOCKE , AND IN HIS POETRY THE IMAGINATION AND SOUL OF SPENSER , THESE POEMS , WITH EVERY AFFECTIONATE PRAYER , ARE INSCRIBED BY HIS SINCERE FRIEND ,</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>WILLIAM LISLE BOWLES .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>I confined myself to fourteen lines , because fourteen lines seemed best adapted to unity of sentiment . I thought nothing about the strict Italian model ; the verses naturally flowed in unpremeditated harmony , as my ear directed , but the slightest inspection will prove they were far from being mere elegiac couplets . The subjects were chiefly from river scenery , and the reader will recollect what Sir Humphrey Davy has said on this subject so beautifully ; it will be recollected , also , that they were published ten years before those of Mr Wordsworth on the river Duddon , Yarrow , et cet . There have been many claimants , among modern poets , for the laurel of the sonnet , but , in picturesque description , sentiment , and harmony , I know none superior to those of my friend the Rev . Charles Hoyle , on scenery in Scotland , the mountains of Ben Nevis , Loch Lomond , et cet .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint><span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>To account for the present variations , some remained as originally with their natural pauses , others for the press I thought it best to correct into verse less broken , and now , after fifty years , they are recorrected , and restored , I believe , more nearly to the original shape in which they were first meditated .<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>I hoped by my Sonnets to pay this vast debt .<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>His companion , Mr Lovel , died in youth . SONNETS , ETC . AT TYNEMOUTH PRIORY ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>AFTER A TEMPESTUOUS VOYAGE . As slow I climb the cliff 's ascending side , Much musing on the track of terror past , When o'er the dark wave rode the howling blast , Pleased I look back , and view the tranquil tide That laves the pebbled shore : and now the beam Of evening smiles on the gray battlement , And yon forsaken tower that time has rent :— The lifted oar far off with transient gleam Is touched , and hushed is all the billowy deep ! Soothed by the scene , thus on tired Nature 's breast A stillness slowly steals , and kindred rest ; While sea-sounds lull her , as she sinks to sleep , Like melodies that mourn upon the lyre , Waked by the breeze , and , as they mourn , expire !<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>The remains of this monastery are situated on a lofty point , on the north side of the entrance into the river Tyne , about a mile and a half below North Shields . The rock on which the monastery stood rendered it visible at sea a long way off , in every direction , whence it presented itself as if exhorting the seamen in danger to make their vows , and promise masses and presents to the Virgin Mary and St Oswin for their deliverance . BAMBOROUGH CASTLE .<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>Ye holy Towers that shade the wave-worn steep , Long may ye rear your aged brows sublime , Though , hurrying silent by , relentless Time Assail you , and the winds of winter sweep Round your dark battlements ; for far from halls Of Pride , here Charity hath fixed her seat , Oft listening , tearful , when the tempests beat With hollow bodings round your ancient walls ; And Pity , at the dark and stormy hour Of midnight , when the moon is hid on high , Keeps her lone watch upon the topmost tower , And turns her ear to each expiring cry ; Blessed if her aid some fainting wretch may save , And snatch him cold and speechless from the wave .<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>This ancient castle , with its extensive domains , heretofore the property of the family of Forster , whose heiress married Lord Crewe , Bishop of Durham , is appropriated by the will of that pious prelate to many benevolent purposes ; particularly to that of administering instant relief to such shipwrecked mariners as may happen to be cast upon this dangerous coast ; for whose preservation and that of their vessels every possible assistance is contrived , and is at all times ready . The estate is in the hands of trustees appointed under the Bishop 's will . THE RIVER WAINSBECK .<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>While slowly wanders thy sequestered stream , WAINSBECK , the mossy-scattered rocks among , In fancy 's ear making a plaintive song To the dark woods above , that waving seem To bend o'er some enchanted spot , removed From life 's vain coil ; I listen to the wind , And think I hear meek Sorrow 's plaint , reclined O'er the forsaken tomb of him she loved !— Fair scenes , ye lend a pleasure , long unknown , To him who passes weary on his way ;— Yet recreated here he may delay A while to thank you ; and when years have flown , And haunts that charmed his youth he would renew , In the world 's crowd he will remember you .<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>The Wainsbeck is a sequestered river in Northumberland , having on its banks “ Our Lady 's Chapel , ” three-quarters of a mile west of Bothal . It has been commemorated by Akenside . THE TWEED VISITED . O Tweed ! a stranger , that with wandering feet O'er hill and dale has journeyed many a mile , ( If so his weary thoughts he might beguile ) , Delighted turns thy stranger-stream to greet . The waving branches that romantic bend O'er thy tall banks a soothing charm bestow ; The murmurs of thy wandering wave below Seem like the converse of some long-lost friend . Delightful stream ! though now along thy shore , When spring returns in all her wonted pride , The distant pastoral pipe is heard no more ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>Yet here while laverocks sing could I abide , Far from the stormy world 's contentious roar , To muse upon thy banks at eventide .<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>Alluding to the simple and affecting pastoral strains for which Scotland has been so long celebrated . I need not mention Lochaber , the Braes of Bellendine , Tweedside , et cet . ON LEAVING A VILLAGE IN SCOTLAND . Clysdale ! as thy romantic vales I leave , And bid farewell to each retiring hill , Where musing memory seems to linger still , Tracing the broad bright landscape ; much I grieve That , mingled with the toiling crowd , no more I may return your varied views to mark , Of rocks amid the sunshine towering dark , Of rivers winding wild ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>or mountains hoar , Or castle gleaming on the distant steep !— Yet many a look back on thy hills I cast , And many a softened image of the past Sadly combine , and bid remembrance keep , To soothe me with fair scenes , and fancies rude , When I pursue my path in solitude .<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>There is a wildness almost fantastic in the view of the river from Stirling Castle , the course of which is seen for many miles , making a thousand turnings . EVENING . Evening ! as slow thy placid shades descend , Veiling with gentlest hush the landscape still , The lonely , battlement , the farthest hill And wood , I think of those who have no friend ; Who now , perhaps , by melancholy led , From the broad blaze of day , where pleasure flaunts , Retiring , wander to the ring-dove 's haunts Unseen ; and watch the tints that o'er thy bed Hang lovely ; oft to musing Fancy 's eye Presenting fairy vales , where the tired mind Might rest beyond the murmurs of mankind , Nor hear the hourly moans of misery ! Alas for man ! that Hope 's fair views the while Should smile like you , and perish as they smile !</docImprint>

   <div type="dedication">
    <p>TO THE RIVER ITCHIN .<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>Itchin ! when I behold thy banks again , Thy crumbling margin , and thy silver breast , On which the self-same tints still seem to rest , Why feels my heart a shivering sense of pain ! Is it , that many a summer 's day has past Since , in life 's morn , I carolled on thy side ! Is it , that oft since then my heart has sighed , As Youth , and Hope 's delusive gleams , flew fast ! Is it , that those who gathered on thy shore , Companions of my youth , now meet no more ! Whate'er the cause , upon thy banks I bend , Sorrowing ; yet feel such solace at my heart , As at the meeting of some long-lost friend , From whom , in happier hours , we wept to part .</p>
   </div>
   <titlePage>
    <docImprint><span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>The Itchin is a river running from Winchester to Southampton , the banks of which have been the scene of many a holiday sport . The lines were composed on an evening in a journey from<settlement>Oxford</settlement>to Southampton , the first time I had seen the Itchin since I left school .</docImprint>

       <l n="5">Untimely sorrow marked his thoughtful mien !</l>

       <l n="19">Far from the murmuring crowd , unseen , he sought</l>
       <l n="20">Each charm congenial to his saddened thought . 20</l>
       <l n="21">When the gray morn illumed the mountain 's side ,</l>

       <l n="129">From realm to realm the hideous War-fiend hies</l>
       <l n="130">Wide o'er the wasted earth ; before him flies 130</l>
       <l n="131">Affright , on pinions fleeter than the wind ;</l>

       <l n="133">The havoc of his echoing march pursue :</l>
       <l n="134">Meantime his steps are bathed in the warm dew</l>
       <l n="135">Of bloodshed , and of tears ;— but his dread name</l>
       <l n="136">Shall perish — the loud clarion of his fame</l>
       <l n="137">One day shall cease , and , wrapt in hideous gloom ,</l>
       <l n="138">Forgetfulness bestride his shapeless tomb !</l>
       <l n="139">But bear thou fearless on ;— the God of all ,</l>
       <l n="140">To whom the afflicted kneel , the friendless call , 140</l>
       <l n="141">From His high throne of mercy shall approve</l>
       <l n="142">The holy deeds of Mercy and of Love :</l>
       <l n="143">For when the vanities of life 's brief day</l>
       <l n="144">Oblivion 's hurrying wing shall sweep away ,</l>
       <l n="145">Each act by Charity and Mercy done , 145</l>

       <l n="3">Who darkly speedest on thy destined way ,</l>

       <l n="5">Spirit ! behold thy victory ! Assume</l>
       <l n="6">A form more terrible , an ampler plume ;</l>
       <l n="7">For he , who wandered o'er the world alone ,</l>
       <l n="8">Listening to Misery 's universal moan ;</l>
       <l n="9">He who , sustained by Virtue 's arm sublime ,</l>
       <l n="10">Tended the sick and poor from clime to clime , 10</l>
       <l n="11">Low in the dust is laid , thy noblest spoil !</l>
       <l n="12">And Mercy ceases from her awful toil !</l>
       <l n="13">‘ Twas where the pestilence at thy command</l>

       <l n="15">When many a mingled cry and dying prayer</l>
       <l n="16">Resounded to the listening midnight air ,</l>
       <l n="17">When deep dismay heard not the frequent knell ,</l>

       <l n="20">Amid the sad sights of that fearful scene , 20</l>
       <l n="21">Calm he was found : the dews of death he dried ;</l>
       <l n="22">He spoke of comfort to the poor that cried ;</l>
       <l n="23">He watched the fading eye , the flagging breath ,</l>
       <l n="24">Ere yet the languid sense was lost in death ;</l>
       <l n="25">And with that look protecting angels wear ,</l>
       <l n="26">Hung o'er the dismal couch of pale Despair !</l>
       <l n="27">Friend of mankind ! thy righteous task is o'er ;</l>
       <l n="28">The heart that throbbed with pity beats no more .</l>
       <l n="29">Around the limits of this rolling sphere ,</l>
       <l n="30">Where'er the just and good thy tale shall hear , 30</l>
       <l n="31">A tear shall fall : alone , amidst the gloom</l>
       <l n="32">Of the still dungeon , his long sorrow 's tomb ,</l>
       <l n="33">The captive , mourning , o'er his chain shall bend ,</l>

       <l n="36">On the forsaken silent bed of death ,</l>
       <l n="37">Remembering thy last look and anxious eye ,</l>
       <l n="38">Shall gaze around , unvisited , and die .</l>
       <l n="39">Friend of mankind , farewell ! These tears we shed —</l>
       <l n="40">So nature dictates — o'er thy earthly bed ; 40</l>
       <l n="41">Yet we forget not , it was His high will ,</l>
       <l n="42">Who saw thee Virtue 's arduous task fulfil ,</l>
       <l n="43">Thy spirit from its toil at last should rest :—</l>
       <l n="44">So wills thy GOD , and what He wills is best !</l>
       <l n="45">Thou hast encountered dark Disease 's train ,</l>
       <l n="46">Thou hast conversed with Poverty and Pain ,</l>

       <l n="48">That through this mournful vale unfriended go ;</l>
       <l n="49">And , pale with sympathy , hast paused to hear</l>
       <l n="50">The saddest plaints e'er told to human ear . 50</l>

       <l n="57">The embattled clouds that hid the struggling day ,</l>
       <l n="58">Slow from his face retire in dark array ;</l>
       <l n="59">On the black waves , like promontories hung ,</l>
       <l n="60">A light , as of the orient morn , is flung , 60</l>
       <l n="61">Till blue and level heaves the silent brine ,</l>
       <l n="62">And the new-lighted rocks at distance shine ;</l>
       <l n="63">Ev'n so didst thou go forth with cheering eye —</l>
       <l n="64">Before thy glance the shades of misery fly ;</l>
       <l n="65">So didst thou hush the tempest , stilling wide</l>
       <l n="66">Of human woe the loud-lamenting tide .</l>
       <l n="67">Nor shall the spirit of those deeds expire ,</l>
       <l n="68">As fades the feeble spark of vital fire ,</l>
       <l n="69">But beam abroad , and cheer with lustre mild</l>
       <l n="70">Humanity 's remotest prospects wild , 70</l>
       <l n="71">Till this frail orb shall from its sphere be hurled ,</l>
       <l n="72">Till final ruin hush the murmuring world ,</l>
       <l n="73">And all its sorrows , at the awful blast</l>
       <l n="74">Of the archangel 's trump , be but as shadows past !</l>
       <l n="75">Relentless Time , that steals with silent tread ,</l>
       <l n="76">Shall tear away the trophies of the dead .</l>
       <l n="77">Fame , on the pyramid 's aspiring top ,</l>
       <l n="78">With sighs shall her recording trumpet drop ;</l>
       <l n="79">The feeble characters of Glory 's hand</l>
       <l n="80">Shall perish , like the tracks upon the sand ; 80</l>
       <l n="81">But not with these expire the sacred flame</l>
       <l n="82">Of Virtue , or the good man 's honoured name .</l>

       <l n="86">Thy steps were led through many a distant land .</l>

       <l n="93">The hoary chieftain , who thy tale shall hear ,</l>
       <l n="94">Pale on thy grave shall drop his faltering spear ;</l>
       <l n="95">The cold , unpitying Cossack thirst no more</l>
       <l n="96">To bathe his burning falchion deep in gore ;</l>
       <l n="97">Relentless to the cry of carnage speed ,</l>

       <l n="121">And the relenting Pagan turn aside</l>

       <l n="130">Where'er thy weary pilgrimage hath been , 130</l>
       <l n="131">There shalt thou pause ; and shutting from thy heart</l>

       <l n="18">The shores , the sound of these encircling seas ,</l>
       <l n="19">Heard from his infant days , and the piled heap</l>
       <l n="20">Of holy stones , where his forefathers sleep ! 20</l>
       <l n="21">Ah , me ! till sunk by sorrow , I shall dwell</l>
       <l n="22">With them forgetful in the narrow cell ,</l>
       <l n="23">Never shall time from my fond heart efface</l>
       <l n="24">His image ; oft his shadow I shall trace</l>
       <l n="25">Upon the glimmering waters , when on high</l>
       <l n="26">The white moon wanders through the cloudless sky .</l>
       <l n="27">Oft in my silent cave , when to its fire</l>
       <l n="28">From the night 's rushing tempest we retire ,</l>
       <l n="29">I shall behold his form , his aspect bland ;</l>
       <l n="30">I shall retrace his footsteps on the sand ; 30</l>
       <l n="31">And , when the hollow-sounding surges swell ,</l>
       <l n="32">Still think I listen to his echoing shell .</l>
       <l n="33">Would I had perished ere that hapless day ,</l>
       <l n="34">When the tall vessel , in its trim array ,</l>
       <l n="35">First rushed upon the sounding surge , and bore</l>
       <l n="36">My age 's comfort from this sheltering shore !</l>
       <l n="37">I saw it spread its white wings to the wind ,</l>
       <l n="38">Too soon it left these hills and woods behind ,</l>
       <l n="39">Gazing , its course I followed till mine eye</l>
       <l n="40">No longer could its distant track descry ; 40</l>
       <l n="41">Till on the confines of the billows hoar</l>
       <l n="42">A while it hung , and then was seen no more ,</l>
       <l n="43">And only the blue hollow cope I spied ,</l>
       <l n="44">And the long waste of waters tossing wide .</l>
       <l n="45">More mournful then each falling surge I heard ,</l>
       <l n="46">Then dropt the stagnant tear upon my beard .</l>
       <l n="47">Methought the wild waves said , amidst their roar</l>
       <l n="48">At midnight , Thou shalt see thy son no more !</l>
       <l n="49">Now thrice twelve moons through the mid heavens have rolled</l>
       <l n="50">And many a dawn , and slow night , have I told : 50</l>
       <l n="51">And still as every weary day goes by ,</l>
       <l n="52">A knot recording on my line I tie ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 31 ]</span></l>
       <l n="53">But never more , emerging from the main ,</l>
       <l n="54">I see the stranger 's bark approach again .</l>
       <l n="55">Has the fell storm o'erwhelmed him ! Has its sweep</l>
       <l n="56">Buried the bounding vessel in the deep !</l>
       <l n="57">Is he cast bleeding on some desert plain !</l>
       <l n="58">Upon his father did he call in vain !</l>
       <l n="59">Have pitiless and bloody tribes defiled</l>
       <l n="60">The cold limbs of my brave , my beauteous child ! 60</l>
       <l n="61">Oh ! I shall never , never hear his voice ;</l>
       <l n="62">The spring-time shall return , the isles rejoice ,</l>
       <l n="63">But faint and weary I shall meet the morn ,</l>
       <l n="64">And ‘ mid the cheering sunshine droop forlorn !</l>
       <l n="65">The joyous conch sounds in the high wood loud ,</l>
       <l n="66">O'er all the beach now stream the busy crowd ;</l>
       <l n="67">Fresh breezes stir the waving plantain grove ;</l>
       <l n="68">The fisher carols in the winding cove ;</l>
       <l n="69">And light canoes along the lucid tide</l>
       <l n="70">With painted shells and sparkling paddles glide . 70</l>
       <l n="71">I linger on the desert rock alone ,</l>
       <l n="72">Heartless , and cry for thee , my son , my son .</l>

     <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 31 ]</span>I find on referring to the narrative of Captain Wilson 's voyage to the Pelew Islands , that the knots were tied at the time of Prince Le Boo 's departure , and that one was untied every moon by the disconsolate father .</p>
     <p>The evening before the “ Oroolong ” sailed , the King asked Captain Wilson how long it might be before his return to Pelew ; and being told that it would probably be about thirty moons , or might chance to extend to six more , Abba Thule drew from his basket a piece of line , and after making thirty knots on it , a little distance from each other , left a long space , and then adding six others , carefully put it by .</p>

       <l n="18">Thy heart nor fears , nor feels the bitter shower ;</l>

       <l n="40">And the fair rose the sullied cheek forsake ! 40</l>
       <l n="41">As when still Autumn 's gradual gloom is laid</l>
       <l n="42">Far o'er the fading forest 's saddened shade ,</l>
       <l n="43">A mournful gleam illumines the cold hill ,</l>
       <l n="44">Yet palely wandering o'er the distant rill ;</l>
       <l n="45">But when the hollow gust , slow rising , raves ,</l>
       <l n="46">And high the pine on yon lone summit waves ,</l>
       <l n="47">Each milder charm , like pictures of a dream ,</l>
       <l n="48">Hath perished , mute the birds , and dark the stream !</l>
       <l n="49">Scuds the dreer sleet upon the whirlwind borne ,</l>

       <l n="62">The tints of loveliness , that shine no more ?</l>
       <l n="63">How then for thee , who pinest in life 's gloom ,</l>

       <l n="65">For thee , exposed amid the desert drear ,</l>
       <l n="66">Which no glad gales or vernal sunbeams cheer !</l>
       <l n="67">Though some there are , who lift their head sublime ,</l>
       <l n="68">Nor heed the transient storms of fate or time ;</l>
       <l n="69">Too oft , alas ! beneath unfriendly skies ,</l>
       <l n="70">The tender blossom shrinks its leaves , and dies ! 70</l>
       <l n="71">Go , struggle with thy fate , pursue thy way ;—</l>
       <l n="72">Though thou art poor , the world around is gay !</l>
       <l n="73">Thou hast no bread ; but on thy aching sight</l>
       <l n="74">Proud luxury 's pavilions glitter bright ;</l>
       <l n="75">In thy cold ear the song of gladness swells ,</l>
       <l n="76">Whilst vacant folly chimes her tinkling bells :</l>
       <l n="77">The careless crowd prolong their hollow glee ,</l>
       <l n="78">Nor one relenting bosom thinks of thee .</l>
       <l n="79">Will not the indignant spirit then rebel ,</l>
       <l n="80">And the dark tide of passions fearful swell ! 80</l>
       <l n="81">Will not despight , perhaps , or bitter need ,</l>
       <l n="82">Urge then thy temper to some direful deed !</l>
       <l n="83">Pale Guilt shall call thee to her ghastly band ,</l>
       <l n="84">Or Murder welcome thee with reeking hand !</l>
       <l n="85">O wretched state , where our best feelings lie</l>
       <l n="86">Deep sunk in sullen , hopeless apathy !</l>
       <l n="87">Or wakeful cares , or gloomy terrors start ,</l>
       <l n="88">And night and tempest mingle in the heart !</l>
       <l n="89">All mournful to the pensive sage 's eye ,</l>
       <l n="90">The monuments of human glory lie ; 90</l>
       <l n="91">Fall'n palaces , crushed by the ruthless haste</l>

       <l n="100">Amid the universe , ordained to climb 100</l>
       <l n="101">The arduous height where Virtue sits serene ;—</l>

      <head>THE DYING SLAVE .</head>
       <l n="1">Faint-gazing on the burning orb of day ,</l>
       <l n="2">When Afric 's injured son expiring lay ,</l>

       <l n="11">Swiftly the delights to share ,</l>

       <l n="15">Fleeter than the hurricane ,</l>

       <l n="19">Where thy infant brothers played</l>
       <l n="20">Beneath the fragrant citron shade ; 20</l>
       <l n="21">Where through green savannahs wide</l>
       <l n="22">Cooling rivers silent glide ,</l>
       <l n="23">Or the shrill cicalas sing</l>
       <l n="24">Ceaseless to their murmuring ;</l>
       <l n="25">Where the dance , the festive song ,</l>
       <l n="26">Of many a friend divided long ,</l>
       <l n="27">Doomed through stranger lands to roam ,</l>
       <l n="28">Shall bid thy spirit welcome home !</l>
       <l n="29">Fearless o'er the foaming tide</l>
       <l n="30">Again thy light canoe shall ride ; 30</l>
       <l n="31">Fearless on the embattled plain</l>
       <l n="32">Thou shalt lift thy lance again ;</l>
       <l n="33">Or , starting at the call of morn ,</l>
       <l n="34">Wake the wild woods with thy horn ;</l>

       <l n="38">On cool Andracte 's yellow sands ;</l>
       <l n="39">Or , in the embowering orange-grove ,</l>
       <l n="40">Tell to thy long-forsaken love 40</l>
       <l n="41">The wounds , the agony severe ,</l>
       <l n="42">Thy patient spirit suffered here !</l>
       <l n="43">Fear not now the tyrant 's power ,</l>
       <l n="44">Past is his insulting hour ;</l>

       <l n="48">Murmuring on the gales of morn !</l>
       <l n="49">Go in peace ; yet we remain</l>
       <l n="50">Far distant toiling on in pain ; 50</l>
       <l n="51">Ere the great Sun fire the skies</l>
       <l n="52">To our work of woe we rise ;</l>
       <l n="53">And see each night , without a friend ,</l>
       <l n="54">The world 's great comforter descend !</l>
       <l n="55">Tell our brethren , where ye meet ,</l>
       <l n="56">Thus we toil with weary feet ;</l>
       <l n="57">Yet tell them that Love 's generous flame ,</l>
       <l n="58">In joy , in wretchedness the same ,</l>
       <l n="59">In distant worlds was ne'er forgot ;</l>
       <l n="60">And tell them that we murmur not ; 60</l>
       <l n="61">Tell them , though the pang will start ,</l>
       <l n="62">And drain the life-blood from the heart ,—</l>
       <l n="63">Tell them , generous shame forbids</l>
       <l n="64">The tear to stain our burning lids !</l>
       <l n="65">Tell them , in weariness and want ,</l>
       <l n="66">For our native hills we pant ,</l>
       <l n="67">Where soon , from shame and sorrow free ,</l>
       <l n="68">We hope in death to follow thee !</l>

      <head>MONODY , WRITTEN AT MATLOCK .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Matlock ! amid thy hoary-hanging views ,</l>
       <l n="2">Thy glens that smile sequestered , and thy nooks</l>
       <l n="3">Which yon forsaken crag all dark o'erlooks ;</l>
       <l n="4">Once more I court the long neglected Muse ,</l>
       <l n="5">As erst when by the mossy brink and falls</l>
       <l n="6">Of solitary Wainsbeck , or the side</l>
       <l n="7">Of Clysdale 's cliffs , where first her voice she tried ,</l>
       <l n="8">I strayed a pensive boy . Since then , the thralls</l>
       <l n="9">That wait life 's upland road have chilled her breast ,</l>
       <l n="10">And much , as much they might , her wing depressed . 10</l>
       <l n="11">Wan Indolence , resigned , her deadening hand</l>
       <l n="12">Laid on her heart , and Fancy her cold wand</l>
       <l n="13">Dropped at the frown of fortune ; yet once more</l>
       <l n="14">I call her , and once more her converse sweet ,</l>
       <l n="15">‘ Mid the still limits of this wild retreat ,</l>
       <l n="16">I woo ;— if yet delightful as of yore</l>
       <l n="17">My heart she may revisit , nor deny</l>
       <l n="18">The soothing aid of some sweet melody !</l>
       <l n="19">I hail the rugged scene that bursts around ;</l>
       <l n="20">I mark the wreathed roots , the saplings gray , 20</l>
       <l n="21">That bend o'er the dark Derwent 's wandering way ;</l>
       <l n="22">I mark its stream with peace-persuading sound ,</l>
       <l n="23">That steals beneath the fading foliage pale ,</l>
       <l n="24">Or , at the foot of frowning crags upreared ,</l>
       <l n="25">Complains like one forsaken and unheard .</l>
       <l n="26">To me , it seems to tell the pensive tale</l>
       <l n="27">Of spring-time , and the summer days all flown ;</l>
       <l n="28">And while sad autumn 's voice ev'n now I hear</l>
       <l n="29">Along the umbrage of the high-wood moan ,</l>
       <l n="30">At intervals , whose shivering leaves fall sere ; 30</l>
       <l n="31">Whilst o'er the group of pendant groves I view</l>
       <l n="32">The slowly-spreading tints of pining hue ,</l>
       <l n="33">I think of poor Humanity 's brief day ,</l>
       <l n="34">How fast its blossoms fade , its summers speed away !</l>
       <l n="35">When first young Hope , a golden-tressed boy ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 39 ]</span></l>
       <l n="36">Most musical his early madrigal</l>
       <l n="37">Sings to the whispering waters as they fall ,</l>
       <l n="38">Breathing fresh airs of fragrance and of joy ,</l>
       <l n="39">The wild woods gently wave , the morning sheds</l>
       <l n="40">Her rising radiance on the mountain heads , 40</l>
       <l n="41">Strewed with green isles appears old ocean 's reign ,</l>
       <l n="42">And seen at distance rays of resting light</l>
       <l n="43">Silver the farthest promontory 's height :</l>
       <l n="44">Then hushed is the long murmur of the main ,</l>
       <l n="45">Whilst silent o'er the slowly-crisping tides ,</l>
       <l n="46">Bound to some beaming spot , the bark of pleasure glides .</l>
       <l n="47">Alas ! the scenes that smile in light arrayed</l>
       <l n="48">But catch the sense , and then in darkness fade .</l>
       <l n="49">We , poor adventurers , of peace bereft ,</l>
       <l n="50">Look back on the green hills that late we left , 50</l>
       <l n="51">Or turn , with beating breast and anxious eye ,</l>
       <l n="52">To some faint hope that glimmering meets our sight</l>
       <l n="53">( Like the lone watch-tower in the storm of night ) ,</l>
       <l n="54">Then on the dismal waste are driv'n despairing by !</l>
       <l n="55">Meantime , amid the landscape cold and mute ,</l>
       <l n="56">Hope , sweet enchanter , sighing drops his lute :</l>
       <l n="57">So sad decay and mortal change succeeds ,</l>
       <l n="58">And o'er the silent scene Time , like a giant , speeds !</l>
       <l n="59">Yet the bleak cliffs that lift their heads so high</l>
       <l n="60">( Around whose beetling crags , with ceaseless coil , 60</l>
       <l n="61">And still-returning flight , the ravens toil )</l>
       <l n="62">Heed not the changeful seasons as they fly ,</l>
       <l n="63">Nor spring , nor autumn : they their hoary brow</l>
       <l n="64">Uprear , and ages past , as in this now ,</l>
       <l n="65">The same deep trenches unsubdued have worn ,</l>
       <l n="66">The same majestic frown , and looks of lofty scorn .</l>
       <l n="67">So Fortitude , a mailed warrior old ,</l>
       <l n="68">Appears ; he lifts his scar-intrenched crest ;</l>
       <l n="69">The tempest gathers round his dauntless breast ;</l>
       <l n="70">He hears far off the storm of havoc rolled ; 70</l>
       <l n="71">The feeble fall around : their sound is past ;</l>
       <l n="72">Their sun is set , their place no more is known ;</l>
       <l n="73">Like the wan leaves before the winter 's blast</l>
       <l n="74">They perish :— He , unshaken and alone</l>
       <l n="75">Remains , his brow a sterner shade assumes ,</l>
       <l n="76">By age ennobled , whilst the hurricane ,</l>
       <l n="77">That raves resistless o'er the ravaged plain ,</l>
       <l n="78">But shakes unfelt his helmet 's quivering plume .</l>
       <l n="79">And so yon sovereign of the scene<span type="note_anchor">[ 40 ]</span>I mark</l>
       <l n="80">Above the woods rear his majestic head , 80</l>
       <l n="81">That soon all shattered at his feet shall shed</l>
       <l n="82">Their short-lived beauties : he the winter dark</l>
       <l n="83">Regardless , and the wasteful time that flies ,</l>
       <l n="84">Rejoicing in his lonely might , defies .</l>
       <l n="85">Thee , wandering in the deep and craggy dell ,</l>
       <l n="86">Sequestered stream , with other thoughts I view :</l>
       <l n="87">Thou dost in solitude thy course pursue ,</l>
       <l n="88">As thou hadst bid life 's busy scenes farewell ,</l>
       <l n="89">Yet making still such music as might cheer</l>
       <l n="90">The weary passenger that journeys near . 90</l>
       <l n="91">Such are the songs of Peace in Virtue 's shade ;</l>
       <l n="92">Unheard of Folly , or the vacant train</l>
       <l n="93">That pipe and dance upon the noontide plain ,</l>
       <l n="94">Till in the dust together they are laid !</l>
       <l n="95">But not unheard of Him , who sits sublime</l>
       <l n="96">Above the clouds of this tempestuous clime ,</l>
       <l n="97">Its stir and strife ; to whom more grateful rise</l>
       <l n="98">The humble incense , and the still small voice</l>
       <l n="99">Of those that on their pensive way rejoice ,</l>
       <l n="100">Than shouts of thousands echoing to the skies ; 100</l>
       <l n="101">Than songs of conquest pealing round the car</l>
       <l n="102">Of hard Ambition , or the Fiend of War ,</l>
       <l n="103">Sated with slaughter . Nor may I , sweet stream ,</l>
       <l n="104">From thy wild banks and still retreats depart ,</l>
       <l n="105">Where now I meditate my casual theme ,</l>
       <l n="106">Without some mild improvement on my heart</l>
       <l n="107">Poured sad , yet pleasing ! so may I forget</l>
       <l n="108">The crosses and the cares that sometimes fret</l>
       <l n="109">Life 's smoothest channel , and each wish prevent 109</l>
       <l n="110">That mars the silent current of content !</l>
       <l n="111">In such a spot , amidst these rugged views ,</l>
       <l n="112">The pensive poet in his drooping age</l>
       <l n="113">Might wish to place his reed-roofed hermitage ;</l>
       <l n="114">Where much on life 's vain shadows he might muse .</l>
       <l n="115">If fortune smiled not on his early way ,</l>
       <l n="116">If he were doomed to mourn a faithless friend ,</l>
       <l n="117">Here he might rest , and when his hairs were gray ,</l>
       <l n="118">Behold in peace the parting day descend .</l>
       <l n="119">If a hard world his errors scanned severe ,</l>
       <l n="120">When late the earth received his mouldering clay , 120</l>
       <l n="121">Perhaps some loved companion , wandering near ,</l>
       <l n="122">Plucking the gray moss from the stone , might say :</l>
       <l n="123">Him I remember , in our careless days ,</l>
       <l n="124">Vacant and glad , till many a loss severe</l>
       <l n="125">First hung his placid eyelids with a tear ;</l>
       <l n="126">Yet on such visions ardent would he gaze ,</l>
       <l n="127">As the Muse loved , that oft would smile and die ,</l>
       <l n="128">Like the faint bow that leaves the weeping sky ;</l>
       <l n="129">His heart unguarded , yet it proudly beat</l>
       <l n="130">Against hard wrong , or coward cold deceit ;— 130</l>
       <l n="131">Nor passed he e'er without a sigh the cell</l>
       <l n="132">Where wretchedness and her pale children dwell .</l>
       <l n="133">He never wished to win the world 's cold ear ,</l>
       <l n="134">Nor , prized by those he loved , its blame could fear ;</l>
       <l n="135">Its praise he left to those who , at their will ,</l>
       <l n="136">The ingenious strain of torturing art could trill !</l>
       <l n="137">Content , as random fancies might inspire ,</l>
       <l n="138">If his weak reed , at times , or plaintive lyre ,</l>
       <l n="139">He touched with desultory hand , and drew</l>
       <l n="140">Some softened tones , to Nature not untrue . 140</l>
       <l n="141">The leaves , O Derwent ! on thy bosom still</l>
       <l n="142">Oft with the gust now fall — the season pale</l>
       <l n="143">Hath smote with hand unseen the silent vale ,</l>
       <l n="144">And slowly steals the verdure from the hill ;</l>
       <l n="145">So the fair scene departs , yet wears a while</l>
       <l n="146">The lingering traces of its beauteous smile :</l>
       <l n="147">But we who by thy margin stray , or climb</l>
       <l n="148">The cliff 's aërial height , or join the song</l>
       <l n="149">Of hope and gladness amidst yonder throng ,</l>
       <l n="150">Losing the brief and fleeting hours of time , 150</l>

       <l n="159">Bright bursts the sun upon the shaggy scene !</l>
       <l n="160">The aged rocks their glittering summits gray 160</l>
       <l n="161">Hang beautiful amid the beams of day ;</l>
       <l n="162">And all the woods , with slowly-fading green ,</l>

       <l n="170">And wide below the brightening landscape glows ! 170</l>
       <l n="171">Though brief the time and short our course to run ,</l>
       <l n="172">Derwent ! amid the scenes that deck thy side ,</l>
       <l n="173">Ere yet the parting paths of life divide ,</l>

       <l n="176">Here may we , ere the sun of life goes down ,</l>
       <l n="177">A while regardless of the morrow , dwell ; 177</l>
       <l n="178">Then to our destined roads , and speed us well !</l>

      <head>THE RIGHT HONOURABLE EDMUND BURKE .</head>
       <l n="1">Why mourns the ingenuous Moralist , whose mind</l>
       <l n="2">Science has stored , and Piety refined ,</l>
       <l n="3">That fading Chivalry displays no more</l>
       <l n="4">Her pomp and stately tournaments of yore !</l>
       <l n="5">Lo ! when Philosophy and Truth advance ,</l>
       <l n="6">Scared at their frown , she drops her glittering lance ;</l>
       <l n="7">Round her reft castles the pale ivy crawls ,</l>
       <l n="8">And sunk and silent are her bannered halls !</l>
       <l n="9">As when far off the golden evening sails ,</l>
       <l n="10">And slowly sink the fancy-painted vales , 10</l>
       <l n="11">With rich pavilions spread in long array ;</l>
       <l n="12">So rolls the enchanter 's radiant realm away ;</l>
       <l n="13">So on the sight the parting glories fade ,</l>
       <l n="14">The gorgeous vision sets in endless shade .</l>
       <l n="15">But shall the musing mind for this lament ,</l>
       <l n="16">Or mourn the wizard 's Gothic fabric rent !</l>
       <l n="17">Shall he , with Fancy 's poor and pensive child ,</l>
       <l n="18">Gaze on his shadowy vales , and prospects wild ,</l>
       <l n="19">With lingering love , and sighing bid farewell</l>
       <l n="20">To the dim pictures of his parting spell ! 20</l>
       <l n="21">No , BURKE ! thy heart , by juster feelings led ,</l>
       <l n="22">Mourns for the spirit of high Honour fled ;</l>
       <l n="23">Mourns that Philosophy , abstract and cold ,</l>
       <l n="24">Withering should smite life 's fancy-flowered mould ;</l>
       <l n="25">And many a smiling sympathy depart ,</l>
       <l n="26">That graced the sternness of the manly heart .</l>
       <l n="27">Nor shall the wise and virtuous scan severe</l>
       <l n="28">These fair illusions , ev'n to nature dear .</l>
       <l n="29">Though now no more proud Chivalry recalls</l>
       <l n="30">Her tourneys bright , and pealing festivals ; 30</l>
       <l n="31">Though now on high her idle spear is hung ,</l>
       <l n="32">Though Time her mouldering harp has half unstrung ;</l>
       <l n="33">Her milder influence shall she still impart ,</l>
       <l n="34">To decorate , but not disguise , the heart ;</l>
       <l n="35">To nurse the tender sympathies that play</l>
       <l n="36">In the short sunshine of life 's early way ;</l>
       <l n="37">For female worth and meekness to inspire</l>
       <l n="38">Homage and love , and temper rude desire ;</l>
       <l n="39">Nor seldom with sweet dreams sad thoughts to cheer ,</l>
       <l n="40">And half beguile affliction of her tear ! 40</l>
       <l n="41">Lo ! this her boast ; and still , O BURKE ! be thine</l>
       <l n="42">Her glowing hues that warm , yet tempered shine ;</l>
       <l n="43">Whilst whispers bland , and fairest dreams , attend</l>
       <l n="44">Thy evening path , till the last shade descend !</l>
       <l n="45">So may she soothe , with loftier wisdom 's aid ,</l>
       <l n="46">Thy musing leisure in the silent shade ,</l>
       <l n="47">And bid poor Fancy , her cold pinions wet ,</l>
       <l n="48">Life 's cloudy skies and beating showers forget .</l>
       <l n="49">But can her fairest form , her sweetest song ,</l>
       <l n="50">Soothe thee , assailed by calumny and wrong ! 50</l>
       <l n="51">Ev'n now thy foes with louder accents cry :</l>
       <l n="52">Champion of unrelenting tyranny ,</l>
       <l n="53">At Freedom hast thou aimed the deadly blow ,</l>
       <l n="54">And striven with impious arm to lay her altars low !</l>
       <l n="55">No , BURKE ! indignant at the voice we start :</l>
       <l n="56">We trust thy liberal views , thy generous heart ;</l>
       <l n="57">We think of those who , naked , pale , and poor ,</l>
       <l n="58">Relieved and blessed , have wandered from thy door ;</l>
       <l n="59">We see thee with unwearied step explore</l>
       <l n="60">Each track of bloodshed on the farthest shore 60</l>
       <l n="61">Of injured Asia , and thy swelling breast</l>
       <l n="62">Harrowing the oppressor , mourning for the oppressed ,</l>
       <l n="63">No , BURKE ! where'er Injustice rears her head ,</l>
       <l n="64">Where'er with blood her idol grim is fed ;</l>
       <l n="65">Where'er fell Cruelty , at her command ,</l>
       <l n="66">With crimson banner marches through the land ,</l>
       <l n="67">And striding , like a giant , onward hies ,</l>
       <l n="68">Whilst man , a trodden worm , looks up , and dies ;</l>
       <l n="69">Where'er pale Murder in her train appears ,</l>
       <l n="70">With reeking axe , and garments wet with tears ; 70</l>
       <l n="71">Or , lowering Jealousy , unmoved as Fate ,</l>
       <l n="72">Bars fast the prison-cage 's iron gate</l>
       <l n="73">Upon the buried sorrows and the cries</l>
       <l n="74">Of him who there , lost and forgotten , lies ;—</l>
       <l n="75">When ministers like these , in fearful state ,</l>
       <l n="76">Upon a bloody tyrant 's bidding wait ,</l>
       <l n="77">Thou too shalt own ( and Justice lift her rod )</l>
       <l n="78">The cause of Freedom is the cause of GOD !</l>
       <l n="79">Fair spirit , who dost rise in beauteous pride ,</l>
       <l n="80">Where proud Oppression hath thine arm defied ! 80</l>
       <l n="81">When led by Virtue thou dost firm advance ,</l>
       <l n="82">And bathe in Guilt 's warm blood thy burning lance ;</l>
       <l n="83">When all thy form its awful port assumes ,</l>
       <l n="84">And in the tempest shake thy crimson plumes ,</l>
       <l n="85">I mark thy lofty mien , thy steady eye ,</l>
       <l n="86">So fall thy foes ! with tears of joy I cry .</l>
       <l n="87">But ne'er may Anarchy , with eyes a-flame ,</l>
       <l n="88">And mien distract , assume thy awful name ;</l>
       <l n="89">Her pale torch sheds afar its hideous glare ,</l>
       <l n="90">And shows the blood-drops in her dabbled hair ; 90</l>
       <l n="91">The fiends of discord hear her hollow voice ,</l>
       <l n="92">The spirits of the deathful storm rejoice :</l>
       <l n="93">As when the rising blast with muttering sweep</l>
       <l n="94">Sounds ‘ mid the branches of the forest deep ,</l>
       <l n="95">The sad horizon lowers , the parting sun</l>
       <l n="96">Is hid , strange murmurs through the high wood run ,</l>
       <l n="97">The falcon wheels away his mournful flight ,</l>
       <l n="98">And leaves the glens to solitude and night ;</l>
       <l n="99">Till soon the hurricane , in dismal shroud ,</l>
       <l n="100">Comes fearful forth , and sounds her conch aloud ; 100</l>
       <l n="101">The oak majestic bows his hoary head ,</l>
       <l n="102">And ruin round his ancient reign is spread :</l>
       <l n="103">So the dark fiend , rejoicing in her might ,</l>
       <l n="104">Pours desolation and the storm of night ;</l>
       <l n="105">Before her dread career the good and just</l>
       <l n="106">Fly far , or sink expiring in the dust ;</l>
       <l n="107">Wide wastes and mighty wrecks around her lie ,</l>
       <l n="108">And the earth trembles at her impious cry !</l>
       <l n="109">Whether her temple , wet with human gore ,</l>
       <l n="110">She thus may raise on Gallia 's ravaged shore , 110</l>
       <l n="111">Belongs to HIM alone , and His high will ,</l>

       <l n="131">Amidst whose hills one poor retreat I sought ,</l>
       <l n="132">Where I might sometimes hide a saddening thought ,</l>
       <l n="133">And having wandered far , and marked mankind</l>

       <l n="139">Whilst from thy calm abodes , and azure skies ,</l>
       <l n="140">Far off the fiend of Discord murmuring flies ! 140</l>
       <l n="141">To him who firm thy injured cause has fought ,</l>
       <l n="142">This humble offering , lo ! the Muse has brought ;</l>
       <l n="143">Nor heed thou , BURKE , if , with averted eye ,</l>

       <l n="148">And on the forehead show her seal impressed ,</l>
       <l n="149">Perhaps they mourn , in bleak Misfortune 's shade ,</l>
       <l n="150">Their age and cares with penury repaid ; 150</l>
       <l n="151">Their errors deeply scanned , their worth forgot ,</l>
       <l n="152">Or marked by hard injustice with a blot .</l>

      <head>ON LEAVING A PLACE OF RESIDENCE .</head>
       <l n="1">If I could bid thee , pleasant shade , farewell</l>
       <l n="2">Without a sigh , amidst whose circling bowers</l>
       <l n="3">My stripling prime was passed , and happiest hours ,</l>
       <l n="4">Dead were I to the sympathies that swell</l>
       <l n="5">The human breast ! These woods , that whispering wave ,</l>
       <l n="6">My father reared and nursed , now to the grave</l>
       <l n="7">Gone down ; he loved their peaceful shades , and said ,</l>
       <l n="8">Perhaps , as here he mused : Live , laurels green ;</l>
       <l n="9">Ye pines that shade the solitary scene ,</l>
       <l n="10">Live blooming and rejoice ! When I am dead 10</l>
       <l n="11">My son shall guard you , and amid your bowers ,</l>
       <l n="12">Like me , find shelter from life 's beating showers .</l>
       <l n="13">These thoughts , my father , every spot endear ;</l>
       <l n="14">And whilst I think , with self-accusing pain ,</l>
       <l n="15">A stranger shall possess the loved domain ,</l>
       <l n="16">In each low wind I seem thy voice to hear .</l>
       <l n="17">But these are shadows of the shaping brain</l>
       <l n="18">That now my heart , alas ! can ill sustain :</l>
       <l n="19">We must forget — the world is wide — the abode</l>
       <l n="20">Of peace may still be found , nor hard the road . 20</l>
       <l n="21">It boots not , so , to every chance resigned ,</l>
       <l n="22">Where'er the spot , we bear the unaltered mind .</l>
       <l n="23">Yet , oh ! poor cottage , and thou sylvan shade ,</l>
       <l n="24">Remember , ere I left your coverts green ,</l>
       <l n="25">Where in my youth I mused , in childhood played ,</l>
       <l n="26">I gazed , I paused , I dropped a tear unseen ,</l>
       <l n="27">That bitter from the font of memory fell ,</l>
       <l n="28">Thinking on him who reared you ; now , farewell !</l>

       <l n="9">That seems , as low it lessens from the eye ,</l>
       <l n="10">To steal away beneath the cloudless sky ! 10</l>
       <l n="11">But yesterday , the misty morn was spread</l>
       <l n="12">In dreariness on the bleak mountain 's head ;</l>
       <l n="13">No glittering prospect from the upland smiled ,</l>
       <l n="14">The driving squall came dark , the sea heaved wild ,</l>
       <l n="15">And , lost and lonely , the wayfarer sighed ,</l>
       <l n="16">Wet with the hoar spray of the flashing tide .</l>
       <l n="17">How changed is now the circling scene ! The deep</l>
       <l n="18">Stirs not ; the glancing roofs and white towers peep</l>
       <l n="19">Along the margin of the lucid bay ;</l>
       <l n="20">The sails , descried far in the offing gray , 20</l>
       <l n="21">Hang motionless , and the pale headland 's height</l>
       <l n="22">Is touched as with sweet gleams of fairy light !</l>
       <l n="23">Oh , lives there on earth 's busy-stirring scene ,</l>
       <l n="24">Whom Nature 's tranquil charms , her airs serene ,</l>
       <l n="25">Her seas , her skies , her sunbeams , fail to move</l>
       <l n="26">With stealing tenderness and grateful love !</l>
       <l n="27">Go , thankless man , to Misery 's cave — behold</l>
       <l n="28">Captivity , stretched in her dungeon cold !</l>
       <l n="29">Or think on those who , in yon dreary mine ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 54 ]</span></l>

       <l n="40">Here straggling sheep the scanty pasture glean , 40</l>
       <l n="41">Or , on the jutting fragments that impend ,</l>

       <l n="43">Mountain , no pomp of waving woods hast thou ,</l>

       <l n="46">No streamlets sparkle o'er their pebbly bed !</l>
       <l n="47">But thou canst boast thy beauties : ample views</l>

       <l n="49">Headlands around new-lighted ; sails , and seas ,</l>
       <l n="50">Now glassy-smooth , now wrinkling to the breeze ; 50</l>
       <l n="51">And when the drisly Winter , wrapped in sleet ,</l>
       <l n="52">Goes by , and winds and rain thy ramparts beat ,</l>

       <l n="59">And such is he , who , clad in watchet weeds ,</l>
       <l n="60">And boasting little more than nature needs , 60</l>
       <l n="61">Can wrap him in contentedness , and wear</l>
       <l n="62">A port unchanged , in seasons rude or fair .</l>
       <l n="63">His may be Fancy 's sunshine , and the Muse</l>
       <l n="64">May deck his visions with her fairest hues ;</l>
       <l n="65">And he may lift his honest front , and say</l>
       <l n="66">To the hard storm , that rends his locks of gray ,</l>
       <l n="67">I heed thee not ;— he unappalled may stand</l>

       <l n="70">Mad , impious Riot his loud wassail keeps , 70</l>

       <l n="83">The Earthquake 's Demon hies aloft ; he waits ,</l>

       <l n="281">Beyond the long curve of the lessening bay</l>
       <l n="282">The still Atlantic stretches its bright way ;</l>
       <l n="283">The tall ship moves not on the tranquil brine ;</l>
       <l n="284">Around , the solemn promontories shine ;</l>
       <l n="285">No sounds approach us , save , at times , the cry</l>
       <l n="286">Of the gray gull , that scarce is heard so high ;</l>
       <l n="287">The billows make no noise , and on the breast</l>

       <l n="295">Alas ! we think upon this seat of care ,</l>
       <l n="296">And ask , if peace , if harmony be there .</l>
       <l n="297">We hear the clangours and the cries that shake</l>

       <l n="313">And Massacre , by yelling furies led ,</l>
       <l n="314">With ghastly grin and eye-balls rolling red !</l>
       <l n="315">O'er a vast field , wide heaped with festering slain ,</l>
       <l n="316">Hark ! how the Demon Passions shout amain ,</l>
       <l n="317">And cry , exulting , while the death-storm lowers ,</l>
       <l n="318">Hurrah ! the kingdoms of the world are ours !</l>
       <l n="319">O GOD ! who madest man , I see these things ,</l>
       <l n="320">And wearied wish for a fleet angel 's wings , 320</l>
       <l n="321">That I might fly away , and hear no more</l>
       <l n="322">The surge that moans along this mortal shore !</l>
       <l n="323">But Joy 's unclouded sunshine may not be ,</l>
       <l n="324">Till , Father of all worlds , we rest with Thee !</l>
       <l n="325">Then Truth , uplifting from thy works the pall ,</l>

       <l n="329">The loud hosannah of eternal praise !</l>
       <l n="330">Here all is mixed with sorrow ; and the clouds 330</l>
       <l n="331">Hang awfully , whose shade the dim earth shrouds ;</l>
       <l n="332">Therefore I mourn for man , and sighing say ,</l>
       <l n="333">As down the steep I wind my homeward way ,</l>
       <l n="334">Oh , when will Earth 's long muttering tempests cease ,</l>
       <l n="335">And all be sunshine ( like this scene ) and peace !</l>

      <head>ON AN UNFORTUNATE AND BEAUTIFUL WOMAN .</head>
      <head>WRITTEN DECEMBER 1783 .</head>
       <l n="1">Oh , Mary , when distress and anguish came ,</l>
       <l n="2">And slow disease preyed on thy wasted frame ;</l>
       <l n="3">When every friend , ev'n like thy bloom , was fled ,</l>
       <l n="4">And Want bowed low thy unsupported head ;</l>
       <l n="5">Sure sad Humanity a tear might give ,</l>
       <l n="6">And Virtue say , Live , beauteous sufferer , live !</l>
       <l n="7">But should there one be found , ( amidst the few</l>
       <l n="8">Who with compassion thy last pangs might view ) ,</l>
       <l n="9">One who beheld thy errors with a tear ,</l>
       <l n="10">To whom the ruins of thy heart were dear , 10</l>
       <l n="11">Who fondly hoped , the ruthful season past ,</l>
       <l n="12">Thy faded virtues might revive at last ;</l>
       <l n="13">Should such be found — oh ! when he saw thee lie ,</l>
       <l n="14">Closing on every earthly hope thine eye ;</l>
       <l n="15">When he beheld despair , with rueful trace ,</l>
       <l n="16">Mark the strange features of thy altered face ;</l>
       <l n="17">When he beheld , as painful death drew nigh ,</l>
       <l n="18">Thy pale , pale cheek , thy feebly lifted eye ,</l>
       <l n="19">Thy chill , shrunk hand , hung down as in despair ,</l>
       <l n="20">Or slowly raised , with many a muttered prayer ;— 20</l>
       <l n="21">When thus , in early youth , he saw thee bend</l>
       <l n="22">Poor to the grave , and die without a friend ;</l>
       <l n="23">Some sadder feelings might unbidden start ,</l>
       <l n="24">And more than common pity touch his heart !</l>
       <l n="25">The eventful scene is closed ; with pausing dread</l>
       <l n="26">And sorrow I drew nigh the silent bed ;</l>
       <l n="27">Thy look was calm — thy heart was cold and still ,</l>
       <l n="28">As if the world had never used it ill ;</l>
       <l n="29">Methought the last faint smile , with traces weak ,</l>
       <l n="30">Still seemed to linger on thy faded cheek . 30</l>
       <l n="31">Poor Mary ! though most beauteous in thy face ,</l>
       <l n="32">Ere sorrow touched it , beamed each lovely grace ;</l>
       <l n="33">Yet , oh ! thy living features never wore</l>
       <l n="34">A look so sweet , so eloquent before ,</l>
       <l n="35">As this , which bids all human passions cease ,</l>
       <l n="36">And tells my pitying heart you died in peace !</l>

       <l n="29">Woden , in thy empire drear ,</l>

       <l n="37">Whilst Hela 's inmost caverns dread</l>
       <l n="38">Echo to their giant tread ,</l>
       <l n="39">And ten thousand thousand shields</l>
       <l n="40">Flash lightning o'er the glimmering fields ! 40</l>
       <l n="41">Hark ! the battle-shouts begin —</l>

       <l n="6">Through dark ravines ; and trees , whose wreathed roots</l>

       <l n="54">Upon the adverse bank , withered , and stripped</l>
       <l n="55">Of all its pleasant leaves , a scathed oak</l>

       <l n="69">They hear the cold rebuke , and then again</l>
       <l n="70">Turn to their sport , as likes them , and dance on ! 70</l>
       <l n="71">And let them dance ; so all their blooming prime</l>

       <l n="73">That wisdom and that virtue which shall best</l>

       <l n="75">And the brief blossoms of their spring-time fade .</l>
       <l n="76">Now wind we up the glen , and hear below</l>

       <l n="81">The time has been when no eye marked thy course ,</l>
       <l n="82">Save His who made the world ! Fancy might dream</l>

       <l n="101">Amidst the crags , and scarce discerned so high ,</l>
       <l n="102">Hangs here and there a sheep , by its faint bleat</l>
       <l n="103">Discovered , whilst the astonished eye looks up ,</l>
       <l n="104">And marks it on the precipice 's brink</l>
       <l n="105">Pick its scant food secure :— and fares it not</l>
       <l n="106">Ev'n so with you , poor orphans , ye who climb</l>
       <l n="107">The rugged path of life without a friend ;</l>
       <l n="108">And over broken crags bear hardly on ,</l>
       <l n="109">With pale imploring looks , that seem to say ,</l>
       <l n="110">My mother ! she is buried , and at rest , 110</l>
       <l n="111">Laid in her grave-clothes ; and the heart is still ,</l>
       <l n="112">The only heart that throughout all the world</l>
       <l n="113">Beat anxiously for you ! Oh , yet bear on ;</l>
       <l n="114">He who sustains the bleating lamb shall feed</l>
       <l n="115">And comfort you : meantime the heaven 's pure beam ,</l>
       <l n="116">That breaks above the sable mountain 's brow ,</l>
       <l n="117">Lighting , one after one , the sunless crags ,</l>
       <l n="118">Awakes the blissful confidence , that here ,</l>
       <l n="119">Or in a world where sorrow never comes ,</l>
       <l n="120">All shall be well . 120</l>
       <l n="121">Now through the whispering wood</l>
       <l n="122">We steal , and mark the old and mossy oaks</l>
       <l n="123">Imboss the mountain slope ; or the wild ash ,</l>
       <l n="124">With rich red clusters mantling ; or the birch ,</l>
       <l n="125">In lonely glens light-wavering ; till behold !</l>
       <l n="126">The rapid river shooting through the gloom</l>
       <l n="127">Its lucid line along ; and on its side</l>
       <l n="128">The bordering pastures green , where the swinked ox</l>
       <l n="129">Lies dreaming , heedless of the numerous flies</l>
       <l n="130">That , in the transitory sunshine , hum 130</l>
       <l n="131">Round his broad breast ; and further up the cot ,</l>
       <l n="132">With blue , light smoke ascending ; images</l>
       <l n="133">Of peace and comfort ! The wild rocks around</l>
       <l n="134">Endear your smile the more , and the full mind ,</l>
       <l n="135">Sliding from scenes of dread magnificence ,</l>
       <l n="136">Sinks on your charms reposing ; such repose</l>
       <l n="137">The sage may feel , when , filled and half-oppressed</l>
       <l n="138">With vast conceptions , smiling he returns</l>
       <l n="139">To life 's consoling sympathies , and hears ,</l>
       <l n="140">With heartfelt tenderness , the bells ring out ; 140</l>
       <l n="141">Or pipe upon the mountains ; or the low</l>
       <l n="142">Of herds slow winding down the cottaged vale ,</l>
       <l n="143">Where day 's last sunshine linger . Such repose</l>
       <l n="144">He feels , who , following where his SHAKSPEARE leads ,</l>
       <l n="145">As in a dream , through an enchanted land ,</l>
       <l n="146">Here , with Macbeth , in the dread cavern hails</l>
       <l n="147">The weird sisters , and the dismal deed</l>
       <l n="148">Without a name ; there sees the charmed isle ,</l>
       <l n="149">The lone domain of Prospero ; and , hark !</l>
       <l n="150">Wild music , such as earth scarce seems to own , 150</l>
       <l n="151">And Ariel o'er the slow-subsiding surge</l>
       <l n="152">Singing her smooth air quaintly ! Such repose</l>
       <l n="153">Steals o'er her spirits , when , through storms at sea ,</l>
       <l n="154">Fancy has followed some nigh-foundered bark</l>
       <l n="155">Full many a league , in ocean 's solitude</l>
       <l n="156">Tossed far beyond the Cape of utmost Horn ,</l>
       <l n="157">That stems the roaring deep ; her dreary track</l>
       <l n="158">Still Fancy follows , and at dead of night</l>
       <l n="159">Hears , with strange thunder , the huge fragments fall</l>
       <l n="160">Crashing , from mountains of high-drifting ice 160</l>
       <l n="161">That o'er her bows gleam fearful ; till at last</l>
       <l n="162">She hails the gallant ship in some still bay</l>
       <l n="163">Safe moored ; or of delightful Tinian ;</l>
       <l n="164">Smiling , like fairy isle , amid the waste ;</l>
       <l n="165">Or of New Zealand , where from sheltering rocks</l>
       <l n="166">The clear cascades gush beautiful , and high</l>
       <l n="167">The woodland scenery towers above the mast ,</l>
       <l n="168">Whose long and wavy ensign streams beneath .</l>
       <l n="169">Far inland , clad in snow , the mountains lift</l>
       <l n="170">Their spiry summits , and endear the more 170</l>
       <l n="171">The sylvan scene around ; the healing air</l>
       <l n="172">Breathes o'er green myrtles , and the poe-bird flits ,</l>
       <l n="173">Amid the shade of aromatic shrubs ,</l>
       <l n="174">With silver neck and blue enamelled wing .</l>
       <l n="175">Now cross the stream , and up the narrow track ,</l>
       <l n="176">That winds along the mountain 's edge , behold</l>
       <l n="177">The peasant girl ascend : cheerful her look ,</l>
       <l n="178">Beneath the umbrage of her broad black hat ,</l>
       <l n="179">And loose her dark-brown hair ; the plodding pad</l>
       <l n="180">That bears her panting climbs , and with sure step 180</l>
       <l n="181">Avoids the jutting fragments ; she , meantime ,</l>
       <l n="182">Sits unconcerned , till , lessening from the view ,</l>
       <l n="183">She gains the summit and is seen no more .</l>
       <l n="184">All day , along that mountain 's heathy waste ,</l>
       <l n="185">Booted and strapped , and in rough coat succinct ,</l>
       <l n="186">His small shrill whistle pendent at his breast ,</l>
       <l n="187">With dogs and gun , untired the sportsman roams ;</l>
       <l n="188">Nor quits his wildly-devious range , till eve ,</l>
       <l n="189">Upon the woods , the rocks , and mazy rills</l>
       <l n="190">Descending , warns him home : then he rejoins 190</l>
       <l n="191">The social circle , just as the clear moon ,</l>
       <l n="192">Emerging o'er the sable mountain , sails</l>
       <l n="193">Silent , and calm , and beautiful , and sheds</l>
       <l n="194">Its solemn grandeur on the shadowy scene .</l>
       <l n="195">To music then ; and let some chosen strain</l>
       <l n="196">Of HANDEL gently recreate the sense ,</l>
       <l n="197">And give the silent heart to tender joy .</l>
       <l n="198">Pass on to the hoar cataract ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 67 ]</span>that foams</l>
       <l n="199">Through the dark fissures of the riven rock ;</l>
       <l n="200">Prone-rushing it descends , and with white whirl , 200</l>
       <l n="201">Save where some silent shady pool receives</l>
       <l n="202">Its dash ; thence bursting , with collected sweep ,</l>
       <l n="203">And hollow sound , it hurries , till it falls</l>
       <l n="204">Foaming in the wild stream that winds below .</l>
       <l n="205">Dark trees , that to the mountain 's height ascend ,</l>
       <l n="206">O'ershade with pendent boughs its mossy course ,</l>
       <l n="207">And , looking up , the eye beholds it flash</l>
       <l n="208">Beneath the incumbent gloom , from ledge to ledge</l>
       <l n="209">Shooting its silvery foam , and far within</l>
       <l n="210">Wreathing its curve fantastic . If the harp 210</l>
       <l n="211">Of deep poetic inspiration , struck</l>
       <l n="212">At times by the pale minstrel , whilst a strange</l>
       <l n="213">And beauteous light filled his uplifted eye ,</l>
       <l n="214">Hath ever sounded into mortal ears ,</l>
       <l n="215">Here I might think I heard its tones , and saw ,</l>
       <l n="216">Sublime amidst the solitary scene ,</l>
       <l n="217">With dimly-gleaming harp , and snowy stole ,</l>
       <l n="218">And cheek in momentary frenzy flushed ,</l>
       <l n="219">The great musician stand . Hush , every wind</l>
       <l n="220">That shakes the murmuring branches ! and thou stream , 220</l>
       <l n="221">Descending still with hollow-sounding sweep ,</l>
       <l n="222">Hush ! ‘ Twas the bard struck the loud strings : Arise ,</l>
       <l n="223">Son of the magic song , arise !</l>

       <l n="258">Lest some enormous fragment should descend</l>
       <l n="259">With hideous sweep into the vale , and crush</l>
       <l n="260">The intruding visitant . No sound is here , 260</l>

       <l n="262">A cry as of faint wailing , when the kite</l>

       <l n="271">In harmony ; who filled the earth with joy ,</l>

       <l n="277">Tenfold upspringing , through the heavens ’ wide way</l>
       <l n="278">Held his untired career . These , in their course ,</l>
       <l n="279">As with one shout of acclamation , praise</l>

       <l n="289">The pausing mind ! we leave your awful gloom ,</l>
       <l n="290">And lo ! the footway plank , that leads across 290</l>
       <l n="291">The narrow torrent , foaming through the chasm</l>
       <l n="292">Below ; the rugged stones are washed and worn</l>

       <l n="295">Smooth , deep , and polished as the marble urn ,</l>
       <l n="296">In their hard forms . Here let us sit , and watch</l>
       <l n="297">The struggling current burst its headlong way ,</l>
       <l n="298">Hearing the noise it makes , and musing much</l>
       <l n="299">On the strange changes of this nether world .</l>
       <l n="300">How many ages must have swept to dust 300</l>
       <l n="301">The still succeeding multitudes , that “ fret</l>
       <l n="302">Their little hour ” upon this restless scene ,</l>
       <l n="303">Or ere the sweeping waters could have cut</l>
       <l n="304">The solid rock so deep ! As now its roar</l>
       <l n="305">Comes hollow from below , methinks we hear</l>
       <l n="306">The noise of generations , as they pass ,</l>
       <l n="307">O'er the frail arch of earthly vanity ,</l>
       <l n="308">To silence and oblivion . The loud coil</l>
       <l n="309">Ne'er ceases ; as the running river sounds</l>
       <l n="310">From age to age , though each particular wave 310</l>
       <l n="311">That made its brief noise , as it hurried on ,</l>
       <l n="312">Ev'n whilst we speak , is past , and heard no more ;</l>
       <l n="313">So ever to the ear of Heaven ascends</l>
       <l n="314">The long , loud murmur of the rolling globe ;</l>
       <l n="315">Its strife , its toils , its sighs , its shouts , the same !</l>
       <l n="316">But lo ! upon the hilly croft , and scarce</l>

       <l n="318">Forth peeping ; nor unwelcome is the sight .</l>
       <l n="319">It seems to say : Though solitude be sweet ,</l>
       <l n="320">And sweet are all the images that float 320</l>
       <l n="321">Like summer-clouds before the eye , and charm</l>

       <l n="323">To think that in this world a brother lives .</l>
       <l n="324">And lovelier smiles the scene , that , ‘ mid the wilds</l>
       <l n="325">Of rocks and mountains , the bemused thought</l>
       <l n="326">Remembers of humanity , and calls</l>
       <l n="327">The wildly-roving fancy back to life .</l>
       <l n="328">Here , then , I leave my harp , which I have touched</l>
       <l n="329">With careless hand , and here I bid farewell</l>
       <l n="330">To Fancy 's fading pictures , and farewell 330</l>
       <l n="331">The ideal spirit that abides unseen</l>
       <l n="332">‘ Mid rocks , and woods , and solitudes . I hail</l>
       <l n="333">Rather the steps of Culture , that ascend</l>

       <l n="345">Amidst the rocky scene , and wakes the thought ,</l>
       <l n="346">The tender thought , of all life 's charities .</l>

      <head>SUMMER EVENING AT HOME .</head>
       <l n="1">Come , lovely Evening ! with thy smile of peace</l>
       <l n="2">Visit my humble dwelling ; welcomed in ,</l>
       <l n="3">Not with loud shouts , and the thronged city 's din ,</l>
       <l n="4">But with such sounds as bid all tumult cease</l>
       <l n="5">Of the sick heart ; the grasshopper 's faint pipe</l>
       <l n="6">Beneath the blades of dewy grass unripe ,</l>
       <l n="7">The bleat of the lone lamb , the carol rude</l>
       <l n="8">Heard indistinctly from the village green ,</l>
       <l n="9">The bird 's last twitter , from the hedge-row seen ,</l>
       <l n="10">Where , just before , the scattered crumbs I strewed ,</l>
       <l n="11">To pay him for his farewell song ;— all these</l>
       <l n="12">Touch soothingly the troubled ear , and please</l>
       <l n="13">The stilly-stirring fancies . Though my hours</l>
       <l n="14">( For I have drooped beneath life 's early showers )</l>

       <l n="2">Of sharp December through my cottage pane</l>

       <l n="9">Sombrous and strange upon the darkening wall ,</l>

      <head>MONODY ON THE DEATH OF DR WARTON .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Oh ! I should ill thy generous cares requite</l>
       <l n="2">Thou who didst first inspire my timid Muse ,</l>
       <l n="3">Could I one tuneful tear to thee refuse ,</l>
       <l n="4">Now that thine aged eyes are closed in night ,</l>
       <l n="5">Kind Warton ! Thou hast stroked my stripling head ,</l>
       <l n="6">And sometimes , mingling soft reproof with praise ,</l>
       <l n="7">My path hast best directed through the maze</l>
       <l n="8">Of thorny life : by thee my steps were led</l>
       <l n="9">To that romantic valley , high o'erhung</l>
       <l n="10">With sable woods , where many a minstrel rung 10</l>
       <l n="11">His bold harp to the sweeping waterfall ;</l>
       <l n="12">Whilst Fancy loved around each form to call</l>
       <l n="13">That fill the poet 's dream : to this retreat</l>
       <l n="14">Of Fancy , ( won by whose enticing lay</l>
       <l n="15">I have forgot how sunk the summer 's day ) ,</l>
       <l n="16">Thou first did guide my not unwilling feet ;</l>
       <l n="17">Meantime inspiring the gay breast of youth</l>
       <l n="18">With love of taste , of science , and of truth .</l>
       <l n="19">The first inciting sounds of human praise ,</l>
       <l n="20">A parent 's love excepted , came from thee ; 20</l>
       <l n="21">And but for thee , perhaps , my boyish days</l>
       <l n="22">Had all passed idly , and whate'er in me</l>
       <l n="23">Now live of hope , been buried .</l>
       <l n="24">I was one ,</l>
       <l n="25">Long bound by cold dejection 's numbing chain ,</l>
       <l n="26">As in a torpid trance , that deemed it vain</l>
       <l n="27">To struggle ; nor my eyelids to the sun</l>
       <l n="28">Uplifted : but I heard thy cheering voice ;</l>
       <l n="29">I shook my deadly slumber off ; I gazed</l>
       <l n="30">Delighted ‘ round ; awaked , inspired , amazed , 30</l>
       <l n="31">I marked another world , and in my choice</l>
       <l n="32">Lovelier , and decked with light ! On fairy ground</l>
       <l n="33">Methought I buoyant trod , and heard the sound</l>
       <l n="34">As of enchanting melodies , that stole ,</l>
       <l n="35">Stole gently , and entranced my captive soul .</l>
       <l n="36">Then all was life and hope ! ‘ Twas thy first ray ,</l>
       <l n="37">Sweet Fancy , on the heart ; as when the day</l>
       <l n="38">Of Spring , along the melancholy tract</l>
       <l n="39">Of wintry Lapland , dawns ; the cataract ,</l>
       <l n="40">From ice dissolving on the silent side 40</l>
       <l n="41">Of some white precipice , with paly gleam</l>
       <l n="42">Descends , while the cold hills a slanting beam</l>
       <l n="43">Faint tinges : till , ascending in his pride ,</l>
       <l n="44">The great Sun from the red horizon looks ,</l>
       <l n="45">And wakes the tuneless birds , the stagnant brooks ,</l>
       <l n="46">And sleeping lakes ! So on my mind 's cold night</l>
       <l n="47">The ray of Fancy shone , and gave delight</l>
       <l n="48">And hope past utterance .</l>
       <l n="49">Thy cheering voice ,</l>
       <l n="50">O Warton ! bade my silent heart rejoice , 50</l>
       <l n="51">And wake to love of nature ; every breeze ,</l>
       <l n="52">On Itchin 's brink was melody ; the trees</l>
       <l n="53">Waved in fresh beauty ; and the wind and rain ,</l>
       <l n="54">That shook the battlements of Wykeham 's fane ,</l>
       <l n="55">Not less delighted , when , with random pace ,</l>
       <l n="56">I trod the cloistered aisles ; and witness thou ,</l>
       <l n="57">Catherine ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 79 ]</span>upon whose foss-encircled brow</l>
       <l n="58">We met the morning , how I loved to trace</l>
       <l n="59">The prospect spread around ; the rills below ,</l>
       <l n="60">That shone irriguous in the gleaming plain ; 60</l>
       <l n="61">The river 's bend , where the dark barge went slow ,</l>
       <l n="62">And the pale light on yonder time-worn fane !<span type="note_anchor">[ 80 ]</span></l>
       <l n="63">So passed my days with new delight ; mean time</l>
       <l n="64">To Learning 's tender eye thou didst unfold</l>
       <l n="65">The classic page , and what high bards of old ,</l>
       <l n="66">With solemn notes , and minstrelsy sublime ,</l>
       <l n="67">Have chanted , we together heard ; and thou ,</l>
       <l n="68">Warton ! wouldst bid me listen , till a tear</l>
       <l n="69">Sprang to mine eye : now the bold song we hear</l>
       <l n="70">Of Greece 's sightless master-bard :[ 81 ] the breast 70</l>
       <l n="71">Beats high ; with stern Pelides to the plain</l>
       <l n="72">We rush ; or o'er the corpse of Hector slain</l>
       <l n="73">Hang pitying ;— and lo ! where pale , oppressed</l>
       <l n="74">With age and grief , sad Priam comes ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 82 ]</span>with beard</l>
       <l n="75">All white he bows , kissing the hands besmeared</l>
       <l n="76">With his last hope 's best blood !</l>
       <l n="77">The oaten reed<span type="note_anchor">[ 83 ]</span></l>
       <l n="78">Now from the mountain sounds ; the sylvan Muse ,</l>
       <l n="79">Reclined by the clear stream of Arethuse ,</l>
       <l n="80">Wakes the Sicilian pipe ; the sunny mead 80</l>
       <l n="81">Swarms with the bees , whose drowsy lullaby</l>
       <l n="82">Soothes the reclining ox with half-closed eye ;</l>
       <l n="83">While in soft cadence to the madrigal ,</l>
       <l n="84">From rock to rock the whispering waters fall !</l>
       <l n="85">But who is he ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 84 ]</span>that , by yon gloomy cave ,</l>
       <l n="86">Bids heaven and earth bear witness to his woe !</l>
       <l n="87">And hark ! how hollowly the ocean-wave</l>
       <l n="88">Echoes his plaint , and murmurs deep below !</l>
       <l n="89">Haste , let the tall ship stem the tossing tide ,</l>
       <l n="90">That he may leave his cave , and hear no more 90</l>
       <l n="91">The Lemnian surges unrejoicing roar ;</l>
       <l n="92">And be great Fate through the dark world thy guide ,</l>
       <l n="93">Sad Philoctetes !<span type="note_anchor">[ 85 ]</span></l>
       <l n="94">So Instruction bland ,</l>
       <l n="95">With young-eyed Sympathy , went hand in hand</l>
       <l n="96">O'er classic fields ; and let my heart confess</l>
       <l n="97">Its holier joy , when I essayed to climb</l>
       <l n="98">The lonely heights where Shakspeare sat sublime ,</l>
       <l n="99">Lord of the mighty spell : around him press</l>
       <l n="100">Spirits and fairy-forms . He , ruling wide 100</l>
       <l n="101">His visionary world , bids terror fill</l>
       <l n="102">The shivering breast , or softer pity thrill</l>
       <l n="103">Ev'n to the inmost heart . Within me died</l>
       <l n="104">All thoughts of this low earth , and higher powers</l>
       <l n="105">Seemed in my soul to stir ; till , strained too long ,</l>
       <l n="106">The senses sunk .</l>
       <l n="107">Then , Ossian , thy wild song</l>
       <l n="108">Haply beguiled the unheeded midnight hours ,</l>
       <l n="109">And , like the blast that swept Berrathron 's towers ,</l>
       <l n="110">Came pleasant and yet mournful to my soul ! 110</l>
       <l n="111">See o'er the autumnal heath the gray mists roll !</l>
       <l n="112">Hark to the dim ghosts ’ faint and feeble cry ,</l>
       <l n="113">As on the cloudy tempest they pass by !</l>
       <l n="114">Saw ye huge Loda 's spectre-shape advance ,</l>
       <l n="115">Through which the stars look pale !</l>
       <l n="116">Nor ceased the trance</l>
       <l n="117">Which bound the erring fancy , till dark night</l>
       <l n="118">Flew silent by , and at my window-grate</l>
       <l n="119">The morning bird sang loud : nor less delight</l>
       <l n="120">The spirit felt , when still and charmed I sate 120</l>
       <l n="121">Great Milton 's solemn harmonies to hear ,</l>
       <l n="122">That swell from the full chord , and strong and clear ,</l>
       <l n="123">Beyond the tuneless couplets ’ weak control ,</l>
       <l n="124">Their long-commingling diapason roll ,</l>
       <l n="125">In varied sweetness .</l>
       <l n="126">Nor , amidst the choir</l>
       <l n="127">Of pealing minstrelsy , was thy own lyre ,</l>
       <l n="128">Warton , unheard ;— as Fancy poured the song ,</l>
       <l n="129">The measured music flowed along ,</l>
       <l n="130">Till all the heart and all the sense 130</l>
       <l n="131">Felt her divinest influence ,</l>
       <l n="132">In throbbing sympathy :— Prepare the car ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 86 ]</span></l>
       <l n="133">And whirl us , goddess , to the war ,</l>
       <l n="134">Where crimson banners fire the skies ,</l>
       <l n="135">Where the mingled shouts arise ,</l>
       <l n="136">Where the steed , with fetlock red ,</l>
       <l n="137">Tramples the dying and the dead ;</l>
       <l n="138">And amain , from side to side ,</l>
       <l n="139">Death his pale horse is seen to ride !</l>
       <l n="140">Or rather , sweet enthusiast , lead 140</l>
       <l n="141">Our footsteps to the cowslip mead ,</l>
       <l n="142">Where , as the magic spell is wound ,</l>
       <l n="143">Dying music floats around :—</l>
       <l n="144">Or seek we some gray ruin 's shade ,</l>
       <l n="145">And pity the cold beggar ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 87 ]</span>laid</l>
       <l n="146">Beneath the ivy-rustling tower ,</l>
       <l n="147">At the dreary midnight hour ,</l>
       <l n="148">Scarce sheltered from the drifting snow ;</l>
       <l n="149">While her dark locks the bleak winds blow</l>
       <l n="150">O'er her sleeping infant 's cheek ! 150</l>
       <l n="151">Then let the shrilling trumpet speak ,</l>
       <l n="152">And pierce in louder tones the ear ,</l>
       <l n="153">Till , while it peals , we seem to hear</l>
       <l n="154">The sounding march , as of the Theban 's song ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 88 ]</span></l>
       <l n="155">And varied numbers , in their course ,</l>
       <l n="156">With gathering fulness , and collected force ,</l>
       <l n="157">Like the broad cataract , swell and sweep along !</l>
       <l n="158">Struck by the sounds , what wonder that I laid ,</l>
       <l n="159">As thou , O Warton ! didst the theme inspire ,</l>
       <l n="160">My inexperienced hand upon the lyre , 160</l>
       <l n="161">And soon with transient touch faint music made ,</l>
       <l n="162">As soon forgotten !</l>
       <l n="163">So I loved to lie</l>
       <l n="164">By the wild streams of elfin poesy ,</l>
       <l n="165">Rapt in strange musings ; but when life began ,</l>
       <l n="166">I never roamed a visionary man ;</l>
       <l n="167">For , taught by thee , I learned with sober eyes</l>
       <l n="168">To look on life 's severe realities .</l>
       <l n="169">I never made ( a dream-distempered thing )</l>
       <l n="170">Poor Fiction 's realm my world ; but to cold Truth 170</l>
       <l n="171">Subdued the vivid shapings of my youth .</l>
       <l n="172">Save when the drisly woods were murmuring ,</l>
       <l n="173">Or some hard crosses had my spirit bowed ;</l>
       <l n="174">Then I have left , unseen , the careless crowd ,</l>
       <l n="175">And sought the dark sea roaring , or the steep</l>
       <l n="176">That braved the storm ; or in the forest deep ,</l>
       <l n="177">As all its gray leaves rustled , wooed the tone</l>
       <l n="178">Of the loved lyre , that , in my springtide gone ,</l>
       <l n="179">Waked me to transport .</l>
       <l n="180">Eighteen summers now 180</l>
       <l n="181">Have smiled on Itchin 's margin , since the time</l>
       <l n="182">When these delightful visions of our prime</l>
       <l n="183">Rose on my view in loveliness . And thou</l>
       <l n="184">Friend of my muse , in thy death-bed art cold ,</l>
       <l n="185">Who , with the tenderest touches , didst unfold</l>
       <l n="186">The shrinking leaves of Fancy , else unseen</l>
       <l n="187">And shelterless : therefore to thee are due</l>
       <l n="188">Whate'er their summer sweetness ; and I strew ,</l>
       <l n="189">Sadly , such flowerets as on hillocks green ,</l>
       <l n="190">Or mountain-slope , or hedge-row , yet my hand 190</l>
       <l n="191">May cull , with many a recollection bland ,</l>
       <l n="192">And mingled sorrow , Warton , on thy tomb ,</l>
       <l n="193">To whom , if bloom they boast , they owe their bloom !</l>

      <head>ON A LANDSCAPE BY RUBENS .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Nay , let us gaze , ev'n till the sense is full ,</l>
       <l n="2">Upon the rich creation , shadowed so</l>
       <l n="3">That not great Nature , in her loftiest pomp</l>
       <l n="4">Of living beauty , ever on the sight</l>
       <l n="5">Rose more magnificent ; nor aught so fair</l>
       <l n="6">Hath Fancy , in her wildest , brightest mood ,</l>
       <l n="7">Imaged of things most lovely , when the sounds</l>
       <l n="8">Of this cold cloudy world at distance sink ,</l>
       <l n="9">And all alone the warm idea lives</l>
       <l n="10">Of what is great , or beautiful , or good , 10</l>
       <l n="11">In Nature 's general plan .</l>
       <l n="12">So the vast scope ,</l>
       <l n="13">O Rubens ! of thy mighty mind , and such</l>
       <l n="14">The fervour of thy pencil , pouring wide</l>
       <l n="15">The still illumination , that the mind</l>
       <l n="16">Pauses , absorbed , and scarcely thinks what powers</l>
       <l n="17">Of mortal art the sweet enchantment wrought .</l>
       <l n="18">She sees the painter , with no human touch ,</l>
       <l n="19">Create , embellish , animate at will ,</l>
       <l n="20">The mimic scenes , from Nature 's ampler range 20</l>
       <l n="21">Caught as by inspiration ; while the clouds ,</l>
       <l n="22">High wandering , and the fairest form of things ,</l>
       <l n="23">Seem at his bidding to emerge , and burn</l>
       <l n="24">With radiance and with life !</l>
       <l n="25">Let us , subdued ,</l>
       <l n="26">Now to the magic of the moment lose</l>
       <l n="27">The thoughts of life , and mingle every sense</l>
       <l n="28">Ev'n in the scenes before us !</l>
       <l n="29">The fresh morn</l>
       <l n="30">Of summer shines ; the white clouds of the east 30</l>
       <l n="31">Are crisped ; beneath , the bright blue champaign steams ;</l>
       <l n="32">The banks , the meadows , and the flowers , send up</l>
       <l n="33">An incensed exhalation , like the meek</l>
       <l n="34">And holy praise of Him whose soul 's deep joy</l>
       <l n="35">The lone woods witness . Thou , whose heart is sick</l>
       <l n="36">Of vanities ; who , in the throng of men ,</l>
       <l n="37">Dost feel no lenient fellowship ; whose eye</l>
       <l n="38">Turns , with a languid carelessness , around</l>
       <l n="39">Upon the toiling crowd , still murmuring on ,</l>
       <l n="40">Restless ;— oh , think , in summer scenes like these , 40</l>
       <l n="41">How sweet the sense of quiet gladness is ,</l>
       <l n="42">That , like the silent breath of morning , steals</l>
       <l n="43">From lowly nooks , and feels itself expand</l>
       <l n="44">Amid the works of Nature , to the Power</l>
       <l n="45">That made them : to the awful thought of HIM</l>
       <l n="46">Who , when the morning stars shouted for joy ,</l>
       <l n="47">Bade the great sun from tenfold darkness burst ,</l>
       <l n="48">The green earth roll in light , and solitude</l>
       <l n="49">First hear the voice of man , whilst hills and woods</l>
       <l n="50">Stood eminent , in orient hues arrayed , 50</l>
       <l n="51">His dwelling ; and all living Nature smiled ,</l>
       <l n="52">As in this pictured semblance , beaming full</l>
       <l n="53">Before us !</l>
       <l n="54">Mark again the various view :</l>
       <l n="55">Some city 's far-off spires and domes appear ,</l>
       <l n="56">Breaking the long horizon , where the morn</l>
       <l n="57">Sits blue and soft : what glowing imagery</l>
       <l n="58">Is spread beneath !— Towns , villages , light smoke ,</l>
       <l n="59">And scarce-seen windmill-sails , and devious woods ,</l>
       <l n="60">Chequering ‘ mid sunshine the grass-level land , 60</l>
       <l n="61">That stretches from the sight .</l>
       <l n="62">Now nearer trace</l>
       <l n="63">The forms of trees distinct — the broad brown oak ;</l>
       <l n="64">The poplars , that , with silvery trunks , incline ,</l>
       <l n="65">Shading the lonely castle ; flakes of light</l>
       <l n="66">Are flung behind the massy groups , that , now</l>
       <l n="67">Enlarging and enlarging still , unfold</l>
       <l n="68">Their separate beauties . But awhile delay ;</l>
       <l n="69">Pass the foot-bridge , and listen ( for we hear ,</l>
       <l n="70">Or think we hear her ) , listen to the song 70</l>
       <l n="71">Of yonder milkmaid , as she brims her pail ;</l>
       <l n="72">Whilst , in the yellow pasture , pensive near ,</l>
       <l n="73">The red cows ruminate .</l>
       <l n="74">Break off , break off , for lo ! where , all alarmed ,</l>
       <l n="75">The small birds ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 89 ]</span>from the late resounding perch ,</l>
       <l n="76">Fly various , hushed their early song ; and mark ,</l>
       <l n="77">Beneath the darkness of the bramble-bank</l>
       <l n="78">That overhangs the half-seen brook , where nod</l>
       <l n="79">The flowing rushes , dew-besprent , with breast</l>
       <l n="80">Ruddy , and emerald wing , the kingfisher 80</l>
       <l n="81">Steals through the dripping sedge away . What shape</l>
       <l n="82">Of terrors scares the woodland habitants ,</l>
       <l n="83">Marring the music of the dawn ? Look round ;</l>
       <l n="84">See , where he creeps , beneath the willowy stump ,</l>
       <l n="85">Cowering and low , step silent after step ,</l>
       <l n="86">The booted fowler : keen his look , and fixed</l>
       <l n="87">Upon the adverse bank , while , with firm hand ,</l>
       <l n="88">He grasps the deadly tube ; his dog , with ears</l>
       <l n="89">Hung back , and still and steady eye of fire ,</l>
       <l n="90">Points to the prey ; the boor , intent , moves on 90</l>
       <l n="91">Panting , and creeping close beneath the leaves ,</l>
       <l n="92">And fears lest ev'n the rustling reeds betray</l>
       <l n="93">His footfall ; nearer yet , and yet more near ,</l>
       <l n="94">He stalks . Who now shall save the heedless group ,</l>
       <l n="95">The speckled partridges , that in the sun ,</l>
       <l n="96">On yonder hillock green , across the stream ,</l>
       <l n="97">Bask unalarmed beneath the hawthorn bush ,</l>
       <l n="98">Whose aged boughs the crawling blackberry</l>
       <l n="99">Entwines !</l>
       <l n="100">And thus , upon the sweetest scenes 100</l>
       <l n="101">Of human loveliness , and social peace</l>
       <l n="102">Domestic , when the full fond heart reclines</l>
       <l n="103">Upon its hopes , and almost mingles tears</l>
       <l n="104">Of joy , to think that in this hollow world</l>
       <l n="105">Such bliss should be its portion ; then ( alas ,</l>
       <l n="106">The bitter change ! ) , then , with his unheard step ,</l>
       <l n="107">In darkness shrouded , yet approaching fast ,</l>
       <l n="108">Death , from amidst the sunny flowers , lifts up</l>
       <l n="109">His giant dread anatomy , and smites ,</l>
       <l n="110">Smites the fair prospect once , whilst every bloom 110</l>
       <l n="111">Hangs shrivelled , and a sound of mourning fills</l>
       <l n="112">The lone and blasted valley : but no sound</l>
       <l n="113">Is here of sorrow or of death , though she ,</l>
       <l n="114">The country Kate , with shining morning cheek</l>
       <l n="115">( Who , in the tumbril , with her market-gear ,</l>
       <l n="116">Sits seated high ) , seems to expect the flash</l>
       <l n="117">Exploding , that shall lay the innocent</l>
       <l n="118">And feathered tenants of the landscape low .</l>
       <l n="119">Not so the clown , who , heedless whether life</l>
       <l n="120">Or death betide , across the plashy ford 120</l>
       <l n="121">Drives slow ; the beasts plod on , foot following foot ,</l>
       <l n="122">Aged and grave , with half-erected ears ,</l>
       <l n="123">As now his whip above their matted manes</l>
       <l n="124">Hangs tremulous , while the dark and shallow stream</l>
       <l n="125">Flashes beneath their fetlock : he , astride</l>
       <l n="126">On harness saddle , not a sidelong look</l>
       <l n="127">Deigns at the breathing landscape , or the maid</l>
       <l n="128">Smiling behind ; the cold and lifeless calf</l>
       <l n="129">Her sole companion : and so mated oft</l>
       <l n="130">Is some sweet maid , whose thrilling heart was formed 130</l>
       <l n="131">For dearer fellowship . But lift the eye ,</l>
       <l n="132">And hail the abode of rural ease . The man</l>
       <l n="133">Walks forth , from yonder antique hall , that looks</l>
       <l n="134">The mistress of the scene ; its turrets gleam</l>
       <l n="135">Amid the trees , and cheerful smoke is seen ,</l>
       <l n="136">As if no spectred shape ( though most retired</l>
       <l n="137">The spot ) there ever wandered , stoled in white ,</l>
       <l n="138">Along the midnight chambers ; but quaint Mab</l>
       <l n="139">Her tiny revels led , till the rare dawn</l>
       <l n="140">Peeped out , and chanticleer his shrill alarm 140</l>
       <l n="141">Beneath the window rang , then , with a wink ,</l>
       <l n="142">The shadowy rout have vanished !</l>
       <l n="143">As the morn</l>
       <l n="144">Jocund ascends , how lovely is the view</l>
       <l n="145">To him who owns the fair domain ! The friend</l>
       <l n="146">Of his still hours is near , to whom he vowed</l>
       <l n="147">His truth ; her eyes reflect his bliss ; his heart</l>
       <l n="148">Beats high with joy ; his little children play ,</l>
       <l n="149">Pleased , in his pathway ; one the scattered flowers</l>
       <l n="150">Straggling collects , the other spreads its arms , 150</l>
       <l n="151">In speechless blandishment , upon the neck</l>
       <l n="152">Of its caressing nurse .</l>
       <l n="153">Still let us gaze ,</l>
       <l n="154">And image every form of heartfelt joy</l>
       <l n="155">Which scenes like these bestow , that charm the sight ,</l>
       <l n="156">Yet soothe the spirit . All is quiet here ,</l>
       <l n="157">Yet cheerful as the green sea , when it shines</l>
       <l n="158">In some still bay , shines in its loneliness</l>
       <l n="159">Beneath the breeze , that moves , and hardly moves ,</l>
       <l n="160">The placid surface . 160</l>
       <l n="161">On the balustrade</l>
       <l n="162">Of the old bridge , that o'er the moat is thrown ,</l>
       <l n="163">The fisher with his angle leans intent ,</l>
       <l n="164">And turns , from the bright pomp of spreading plains ,</l>
       <l n="165">To watch the nimble fry , that glancing oft</l>
       <l n="166">Beneath the gray arch shoot ! Oh , happiest he</l>
       <l n="167">Who steals through life , untroubled as unseen !</l>
       <l n="168">The distant city , with its crowded spires ,</l>
       <l n="169">That dimly shines upon his view , awakes</l>
       <l n="170">No thought but that of pleasure more composed , 170</l>
       <l n="171">As the winds whisper him to sounder sleep .</l>
       <l n="172">He leans upon the faithful arm of her</l>
       <l n="173">For whom his youthful heart beat , fondly beat ,</l>
       <l n="174">When life was new : time steals away , yet health</l>
       <l n="175">And exercise are his ; and in these shades ,</l>
       <l n="176">Though sometimes he has mourned a proud world 's wrong ,</l>
       <l n="177">He feels an independence that all cares</l>
       <l n="178">Breasts with a carol of content ; he hears</l>
       <l n="179">The green leaves of his old paternal trees</l>
       <l n="180">Make music , soothing as they stir : the elm , 180</l>
       <l n="181">And poplar with its silvery trunk , that shades</l>
       <l n="182">The green sward of the bank before his porch ,</l>
       <l n="183">Are to him as companions ;— whilst he turns</l>
       <l n="184">With more endearment to the living smile</l>
       <l n="185">Of those his infants , who , when he is dead ,</l>
       <l n="186">Shall hear the music of the self-same trees</l>
       <l n="187">Waving , till years roll on , and their gray hairs</l>
       <l n="188">Go to the dust in peace .</l>
       <l n="189">Away , sad thought !</l>
       <l n="190">Lo ! where the morning light , through the dark wood , 190</l>
       <l n="191">Upon the window-pane is flung like fire ,</l>
       <l n="192">Hail , Life and Hope ; and thou , great work of art ,</l>
       <l n="193">That ‘ mid this populous and busy swarm</l>
       <l n="194">Of men dost smile serene , as with the hues</l>
       <l n="195">Of fairest , grandest Nature ; may'st thou speak</l>
       <l n="196">Not vainly of the endearments and best joys</l>
       <l n="197">That Nature yields . The manliest heart that swells</l>
       <l n="198">With honest English feelings ,— while the eye ,</l>
       <l n="199">Saddened , but not cast down , beholds far off</l>
       <l n="200">The darkness of the onward rolling storm ,— 200</l>
       <l n="201">Charmed for a moment by this mantling view ,</l>
       <l n="202">Its anxious tumults shall suspend : and such ,</l>
       <l n="203">The pensive patriot shall exclaim , thy scenes ,</l>
       <l n="204">My own beloved country , such the abode</l>
       <l n="205">Of rural peace ! and while the soul has warmth ,</l>
       <l n="206">And voice has energy , the brave arm strength ,</l>
       <l n="207">England , thou shalt not fall ! The day shall come ,</l>
       <l n="208">Yes , and now is , that thou shalt lift thyself ;</l>
       <l n="209">And woe to him who sets upon thy shores</l>
       <l n="210">His hostile foot ! Proud victor though he be , 210</l>
       <l n="211">His bloody march shall never soil a flower</l>
       <l n="212">That hangs its sweet head , in the morning dew ,</l>
       <l n="213">On thy green village banks ! His mustered hosts</l>
       <l n="214">Shall be rolled back in thousands , and the surge</l>
       <l n="215">Bury them ! Then , when peace illumes once more ,</l>
       <l n="216">My country , thy green nooks and inmost vales ,</l>
       <l n="217">It will be sweet amidst the forest glens</l>
       <l n="218">To stray , and think upon the distant storm</l>
       <l n="219">That howled , but injured not !</l>
       <l n="220">At thoughts like these , 220</l>
       <l n="221">What heart , what English heart , but shall beat high !</l>
       <l n="222">Meantime , its keen flash passed , thine eye intent ,</l>
       <l n="223">Beaumont , shall trace the master-strokes of art ,</l>
       <l n="224">And view the assemblage of the finished piece ,</l>
       <l n="225">As with his skill who formed it : ruder views ,</l>
       <l n="226">Savage , with solitary pines , hung high</l>
       <l n="227">Amid the broken crags ( where scowling wait</l>
       <l n="228">The fierce banditti ) , stern Salvator 's hand</l>
       <l n="229">Shall aptly shade : o'er Poussin 's clustering domes ,</l>
       <l n="230">With ampler umbrage , the black woods shall hang , 230</l>
       <l n="231">Beneath whose waving gloom the sudden flash</l>
       <l n="232">Of broken light upon the brawling stream</l>
       <l n="233">Is flung below .</l>
       <l n="234">Aërial Claude shall paint</l>
       <l n="235">The gray fane peering o'er the summer woods ,</l>
       <l n="236">The azure lake below , or distant seas ,</l>
       <l n="237">And sails , in the pellucid atmosphere ,</l>
       <l n="238">Soft gleaming to the morn . Dark on the rock ,</l>
       <l n="239">Where the red lightnings burst , shall Wilson stand ,</l>
       <l n="240">Like mighty Shakspeare , whom the imps of fire 240</l>
       <l n="241">Await . Nor oh , sweet Gainsborough ! shall thee</l>
       <l n="242">The Muse forget , whose simple landscape smiles</l>
       <l n="243">Attractive , whether we delight to view</l>
       <l n="244">The cottage chimney through the high wood peep ;</l>
       <l n="245">Or beggar beauty stretch her little hand ,</l>
       <l n="246">With look most innocent ; or homeward kine</l>
       <l n="247">Wind through the hollow road at eventide ,</l>
       <l n="248">Or browse the straggling branches .</l>
       <l n="249">Scenes like these</l>
       <l n="250">Shall charm all hearts , while truth and beauty live , 250</l>
       <l n="251">And Nature 's pictured loveliness shall own</l>
       <l n="252">Each master 's varied touch ; but chiefly thou ,</l>
       <l n="253">Great Rubens ! shalt the willing senses lead ,</l>
       <l n="254">Enamoured of the varied imagery ,</l>
       <l n="255">That fills the vivid canvas , swelling still</l>
       <l n="256">On the enraptured eye of taste , and still</l>
       <l n="257">New charms unfolding ; though minute , yet grand ,</l>
       <l n="258">Simple , yet most luxuriant ; every light</l>
       <l n="259">And every shade , greatly opposed , and all</l>
       <l n="260">Subserving to one magical effect 260</l>
       <l n="261">Of truth and harmony .</l>
       <l n="262">So glows the scene ;</l>
       <l n="263">And to the pensive thought refined displays</l>
       <l n="264">The richest rural poem . Oh , may views</l>
       <l n="265">So pictured animate thy classic mind ,</l>
       <l n="266">Beaumont , to wander ‘ mid Sicilian scenes ,</l>
       <l n="267">And catch the beauties of the pastoral bard ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 90 ]</span></l>
       <l n="268">Shadowing his wildest landscapes ! Ætna 's fires ,</l>
       <l n="269">Bebrycian rocks , Anapus ’ holy stream ,</l>
       <l n="270">And woods of ancient Pan ; the broken crag 270</l>
       <l n="271">And the old fisher here ; the purple vines</l>
       <l n="272">There bending ; and the smiling boy set down</l>
       <l n="273">To guard , who , innocent and happy , weaves ,</l>
       <l n="274">Intent , his rushy basket , to ensnare</l>
       <l n="275">The chirping grasshoppers , nor sees the while</l>
       <l n="276">The lean fox meditate her morning meal ,</l>
       <l n="277">Eyeing his scrip askance ; whilst further on</l>
       <l n="278">Another treads the purple grapes — he sits ,</l>
       <l n="279">Nor aught regards , but the green rush he weaves .</l>
       <l n="280">O Beaumont ! let this pomp of light and shade 280</l>
       <l n="281">Wake thee , to paint the woods that the sweet Muse</l>

       <l n="23">Fruitless the prayer — the night of deeper woes</l>
       <l n="24">Seems o'er the head even now to close ;</l>
       <l n="25">In vain the path of purity he trod ,</l>
       <l n="26">In vain , in vain ,</l>
       <l n="27">He poured from Fancy 's shell his sweetest hermit strain —</l>

       <l n="18">Who comes in soft and spicy vest ,</l>
       <l n="19">From the mild regions of the West ? 70</l>
       <l n="20">An azure veil bends waving o'er his head ,</l>
       <l n="21">And showers of violets from his hands are shed .</l>
       <l n="22">‘ Tis Zephyr , with a look as young and fair</l>
       <l n="23">As when his lucid wings conveyed</l>
       <l n="24">That beautiful and gentle maid</l>
       <l n="25">Psyche , transported through the air ,</l>
       <l n="26">The blissful couch of Love 's own god to share .</l>
       <l n="27">Winter , avaunt ! thy haggard eye</l>
       <l n="28">Will scare him , as he wanders by ,</l>
       <l n="29">Him and the timid butterfly . 80</l>
       <l n="30">He brings again the morn of May ;</l>
       <l n="31">The lark , amid the clear blue sky ,</l>
       <l n="32">Carols , but is not seen so high ,</l>
       <l n="33">And all the winter 's winds fly far away !</l>
       <l n="34">I cried : O Father of the world , whose might</l>
       <l n="35">The storm , the darkness , and the winds obey ,</l>
       <l n="36">Oh , when will thus the long tempestuous night</l>
       <l n="37">Of warfare and of woe be rolled away !</l>
       <l n="38">Oh , when will cease the uproar and the din ,</l>
       <l n="39">And Peace breathe soft , Summer is coming in ! 90</l>

      <head>ON WILLIAM SOMMERS OF BREMHILL .</head>
       <l n="1">When will the grave shelter thy few gray hairs ,</l>
       <l n="2">O aged man ! Thy sand is almost run ,</l>
       <l n="3">And many a year , in vain , to meet the sun ,</l>
       <l n="4">Thine eyes have rolled in darkness ; want and cares</l>
       <l n="5">Have been thy visitants from morn to morn .</l>
       <l n="6">While trembling on existence thou dost live ,</l>
       <l n="7">Accept what human charity can give ;</l>
       <l n="8">But standing thus , time-palsied , and forlorn ,</l>
       <l n="9">Like a scathed oak , of all its boughs bereft ,</l>
       <l n="10">God and the grave are thy best refuge left .</l>
       <l n="11">When the bells rung , and summer 's smiling ray</l>
       <l n="12">Welcomed again the merry Whitsuntide ,</l>
       <l n="13">And all my humble villagers were gay ;</l>
       <l n="14">I saw thee sitting on the highway side ,</l>
       <l n="15">To feel once more the warm sun 's blessed beam :</l>
       <l n="16">Didst thou then think upon thy own gay prime ,</l>
       <l n="17">On such a holiday , and the glad time</l>
       <l n="18">When thou wert young and happy , like a dream</l>
       <l n="19">Now perished ! No ; the murmured prayer alone</l>
       <l n="20">Rose from the trembling lips towards the Throne</l>
       <l n="21">Of Mercy ; that ere spring returned again ,</l>
       <l n="22">And the long winter blew its dreary blast ,</l>
       <l n="23">To sweep the verdure from the fading plain ,</l>
       <l n="24">Thy burden would be dropped , thy sorrows past !</l>
       <l n="25">O blind and aged man , bowed down with cares ,</l>
       <l n="26">When will the grave shelter thy few gray hairs !</l>

      <head>THE VISIONARY BOY .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Oh ! lend that lute , sweet Archimage , to me !</l>
       <l n="2">Enough of care and heaviness</l>
       <l n="3">The weary lids of life depress ,</l>
       <l n="4">And doubly blest that gentle heart shall be ,</l>
       <l n="5">That wooes of poesy the visions bland ,</l>
       <l n="6">And strays forgetful o'er enchanted land !</l>
       <l n="7">Oh ! lend that lute , sweet Archimage , to me !</l>
       <l n="8">So spoke , with ardent look , yet eyebrow sad ,</l>
       <l n="9">When he had passed o'er many a mountain rude ,</l>
       <l n="10">And many a wild and weary solitude , 10</l>
       <l n="11">‘ Mid a green vale , a wandering minstrel-lad .</l>
       <l n="12">With eyes that shone in softened flame ,</l>
       <l n="13">With wings and wand , young Fancy came ;</l>
       <l n="14">And as she touched a trembling lute ,</l>
       <l n="15">The lone enthusiast stood entranced and mute .</l>
       <l n="16">It was a sound that made his soul forego</l>
       <l n="17">All thoughts of sadness in a world of woe .</l>
       <l n="18">Oh , lend that lute ! he cried : Hope , Pity , Love ,</l>
       <l n="19">Shall listen ; and each valley , rock , and grove ,</l>
       <l n="20">Shall witness , as with deep delight , 20</l>
       <l n="21">From orient morn to dewy-stealing night .</l>
       <l n="22">My spirit , rapt in trance of sweetness high ,</l>
       <l n="23">Shall drink the heartfelt sound with tears of ecstasy !</l>
       <l n="24">As thus he spoke , soft voices seemed to say ,</l>
       <l n="25">Come away , come away ;</l>
       <l n="26">Where shall the heart-sick minstrel stray ,</l>
       <l n="27">But ( viewing all things like a dream )</l>
       <l n="28">By haunted wood , or wizard stream ?</l>
       <l n="29">That , like a hermit weeping ,</l>
       <l n="30">Amid the gray stones creeping ; 30</l>
       <l n="31">With voice distinct , yet faint ,</l>
       <l n="32">Calls on Repose herself to hear its soothing plaint .</l>
       <l n="33">For him , romantic Solitude</l>
       <l n="34">Shall pile sublime her mountains rude ;</l>
       <l n="35">For him , with shades more soft impressed ,</l>
       <l n="36">The lucid lake 's transparent breast</l>
       <l n="37">Shall show the banks , the woods , the hill ,</l>
       <l n="38">More clear , more beautiful , more still .</l>
       <l n="39">For him more musical shall wave</l>
       <l n="40">The pines o'er Echo 's moonlit cave ; 40</l>
       <l n="41">While sounds as of a fairy lyre</l>
       <l n="42">Amid the shadowy cliffs expire !</l>
       <l n="43">This valley where the raptured minstrel stood</l>
       <l n="44">Was shaded with a circling slope of wood ,</l>
       <l n="45">And rich in beauty , with that valley vied ,</l>
       <l n="46">Thessalian Tempe , crowned with verdant bay ,</l>
       <l n="47">Where smooth and clear Peneus winds his way ;</l>
       <l n="48">And Ossa and Olympus , on each side ,</l>
       <l n="49">Rise dark with woods ; or that Sicilian plain</l>
       <l n="50">Which Arethusa 's clearest waters lave , 50</l>
       <l n="51">By many a haunt of Pan , and wood-nymph 's cave ,</l>
       <l n="52">Lingering and listening to the Doric strain</l>
       <l n="53">Of him ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 100 ]</span>the bard whose music might succeed</l>
       <l n="54">To the wild melodies of Pan 's own reed !</l>
       <l n="55">This scene the mistress of the valley held ,</l>
       <l n="56">Fancy , a magic maid ; and at her will ,</l>
       <l n="57">Aërial castles crowned the gleaming hill ,</l>
       <l n="58">Or forests rose , or lapse of water welled .</l>
       <l n="59">Sometimes she sat with lifted eye ,</l>
       <l n="60">And marked the dark storm in the western sky ; 60</l>
       <l n="61">Sometimes she looked , and scarce her breath would draw ,</l>
       <l n="62">As fearful things , not to be told , she saw ;</l>
       <l n="63">And sometimes , like a vision of the air ,</l>
       <l n="64">On wings of shifting light she floated here and there .</l>
       <l n="65">In the breeze her garments flew ,</l>
       <l n="66">Of the brightest skiey blue ,</l>
       <l n="67">Lucid as the tints of morn ,</l>
       <l n="68">When Summer trills his pipe of corn :</l>
       <l n="69">Her tresses to each wing descending fall ,</l>
       <l n="70">Or , lifted by the wind , 70</l>
       <l n="71">Stream loose and unconfined ,</l>
       <l n="72">Like golden threads , beneath her myrtle coronal .</l>
       <l n="73">The listening passions stood aloof and mute ,</l>
       <l n="74">As oft the west wind touched her trembling lute .</l>
       <l n="75">But when its sounds the youthful minstrel heard ,</l>
       <l n="76">Strange mingled feelings , not to be expressed ,</l>
       <l n="77">Rose undefined , yet blissful , on his breast ,</l>
       <l n="78">And all the softened scene in sweeter light appeared .</l>
       <l n="79">Then Fancy waved her wand , and lo !</l>
       <l n="80">An airy troop went beckoning by : 80</l>
       <l n="81">Come , from toil and worldly woe ;</l>
       <l n="82">Come , live with us in vales remote ! they cry .</l>
       <l n="83">These are the flitting phantasies ; the dreams</l>
       <l n="84">That lead the heart through all that elfin land ,</l>
       <l n="85">Where half-seen shapes entice with whispers bland .</l>
       <l n="86">Meantime the clouds , impressed with livelier beams ,</l>
       <l n="87">Roll , in the lucid track of air ,</l>
       <l n="88">Arrayed in coloured brede , with semblances more fair .</l>
       <l n="89">The airy troop , as on they sail ,</l>
       <l n="90">Thus the pensive stranger hail : 90</l>
       <l n="91">In the pure and argent sky ,</l>
       <l n="92">There our distant chambers lie ;</l>
       <l n="93">The bed is strewed with blushing roses ,</l>
       <l n="94">When Quietude at eve reposes ,</l>
       <l n="95">Oft trembling lest her bowers should fade ,</l>
       <l n="96">In the cold earth 's humid shade .</l>
       <l n="97">Come , rest with us ! evanishing , they cried —</l>
       <l n="98">Come , rest with us ! the lonely vale replied .</l>
       <l n="99">Then Fancy beckoned , and with smiling mien ,</l>
       <l n="100">A radiant form arose , like the fair Queen 100</l>
       <l n="101">Of Beauty : from her eye divinely bright ,</l>
       <l n="102">A richer lustre shot , a more attractive light .</l>
       <l n="103">She said : With fairer tints I can adorn</l>
       <l n="104">The living landscape , fairer than the morn .</l>
       <l n="105">The summer clouds in shapes romantic rolled ,</l>
       <l n="106">And those they edge the fading west , like gold ;</l>
       <l n="107">The lake that sleeps in sunlight , yet impressed</l>
       <l n="108">With shades more sweet than real on its breast ;</l>
       <l n="109">‘ Mid baffling stones , beneath a partial ray ,</l>
       <l n="110">The small brook huddling its uneven way ; 110</l>
       <l n="111">The blue far distant hills , the silvery sea ,</l>
       <l n="112">And every scene of summer speaks of me :</l>
       <l n="113">But most I wake the sweetest wishes warm ,</l>
       <l n="114">Where the fond gaze is turned on woman 's breathing form .</l>
       <l n="115">So passing silent through a myrtle grove ,</l>
       <l n="116">Beauty first led him to the bower of Love .</l>
       <l n="117">A mellow light through the dim covert strayed ,</l>
       <l n="118">And opening roses canopied the shade .</l>
       <l n="119">Why does the hurrying pulse unbidden leap !</l>
       <l n="120">Behold , in yonder glade that nymph asleep ! 120</l>
       <l n="121">The heart-struck minstrel hangs , with lingering gaze ,</l>
       <l n="122">O'er every charm his eye impassioned strays !</l>
       <l n="123">An edge of white is seen , and scarcely seen ,</l>
       <l n="124">As soft she breathes , her coral lips between ;</l>
       <l n="125">A lambent ray steals from her half-closed eye ,</l>
       <l n="126">As her breast heaves a short imperfect sigh .</l>
       <l n="127">Sleep , winds of summer , o'er the leafy bower ,</l>
       <l n="128">Nor move the light bells of the nodding flower ;</l>
       <l n="129">Lest but a sound of stirring leaves might seem</l>
       <l n="130">To break the charm of her delicious dream ! 130</l>
       <l n="131">And ye , fond , rising , throbbing thoughts , away ,</l>
       <l n="132">Lest syren Pleasure all the soul betray !</l>
       <l n="133">Oh ! turn , and listen to the ditty</l>
       <l n="134">From the lowly cave of Pity .</l>
       <l n="135">On slaughter 's plain , while Valour grieves ,</l>
       <l n="136">There he sunk to rest ,</l>
       <l n="137">And the ring-dove scattered leaves</l>
       <l n="138">Upon his bleeding breast !</l>
       <l n="139">Her face was hid , while her pale arms enfold</l>
       <l n="140">What seemed an urn of alabaster cold ; 140</l>
       <l n="141">To this she pressed her heaving bosom bare :</l>
       <l n="142">The drops that gathered in the dank abode</l>
       <l n="143">Fell dripping , on her long dishevelled hair ;</l>
       <l n="144">And still her tears , renewed , and silent , flowed :</l>
       <l n="145">And when the winds of autumn ceased to swell ,</l>
       <l n="146">At times was heard a slow and melancholy knell !</l>
       <l n="147">‘ Twas in the twilight of the deepest wood ,</l>
       <l n="148">Beneath whose boughs like sad Cocytus , famed</l>
       <l n="149">Through fabling Greece , from lamentation named<span type="note_anchor">[ 101 ]</span></l>
       <l n="150">A river dark and silent flowed , there stood 150</l>
       <l n="151">A pale and melancholy man , intent</l>
       <l n="152">His look upon that drowsy stream he bent ,</l>
       <l n="153">As ever counting , when the fitful breeze</l>
       <l n="154">With strange and hollow sound sung through the trees ,</l>
       <l n="155">Counting the sallow leaves , that down the current went .</l>
       <l n="156">He saw them not :</l>
       <l n="157">Earth seemed to him one universal blot .</l>
       <l n="158">Sometimes , as most distempered , to and fro</l>
       <l n="159">He paced ; and sometimes fixed his chilling look</l>
       <l n="160">Upon a dreadful book , 160</l>
       <l n="161">Inscribed with secret characters of woe ;</l>
       <l n="162">While gibbering imps , as mocking him , appeared ,</l>
       <l n="163">And airy laughter ‘ mid the dusk was heard .</l>
       <l n="164">Then Fancy waved her wand again ,</l>
       <l n="165">And all that valley that so lovely smiled</l>
       <l n="166">Was changed to a bare champaign , waste and wild .</l>
       <l n="167">“ What pale and phantom-horseman rides amain ? ”</l>
       <l n="168">‘ Tis Terror ;— all the plain , far on , is spread</l>
       <l n="169">With skulls and bones , and relics of the dead !</l>
       <l n="170">From his black trump he blew a louder blast , 170</l>
       <l n="171">And earthquakes muttered as the giant passed .</l>
       <l n="172">Then said that magic maid , with aspect bland ,</l>
       <l n="173">‘ Tis thine to seize his phantom spear ,</l>
       <l n="174">‘ Tis thine his sable trumpet to command ,</l>
       <l n="175">And thrill the inmost heart with shuddering fear .</l>
       <l n="176">But hark ! to Music 's softer sound ,</l>
       <l n="177">New scenes and fairer views accordant rise :</l>
       <l n="178">Above , around ,</l>
       <l n="179">The mingled measure swells in air , and dies .</l>
       <l n="180">Music , in thy charmed shell , 180</l>
       <l n="181">What sounds of holy magic dwell !</l>
       <l n="182">Oft when that shell was to the ear applied ,</l>
       <l n="183">Confusion of rich harmonies ,</l>
       <l n="184">All swelling rose ,</l>
       <l n="185">That came , as with a gently-swelling tide :</l>
       <l n="186">Then at the close ,</l>
       <l n="187">Angelic voices seemed , aloft ,</l>
       <l n="188">To answer as it died the cadence soft .</l>
       <l n="189">Now , like the hum of distant ocean 's stream ,</l>
       <l n="190">The murmurs of the wond'rous concave seem ; 190</l>
       <l n="191">And now exultingly their tones prolong</l>
       <l n="192">The chorded pæans of the choral song ,</l>
       <l n="193">Then Music , with a voice more wildly sweet</l>
       <l n="194">Than winds that pipe on the forsaken shore ,</l>
       <l n="195">When the last rain-drops of the west are o'er ,</l>
       <l n="196">Warbled : Oh , welcome to my blest retreat ,</l>
       <l n="197">And give my sounds to the responsive lyre :</l>
       <l n="198">With me to these melodious groves retire ,</l>
       <l n="199">And such pure feelings share ,</l>
       <l n="200">As , far from noise and folly , soothe thee there . 200</l>
       <l n="201">Here Fancy , as the prize were won ,</l>
       <l n="202">And now she hailed her favourite son ,</l>
       <l n="203">With energy impatient cried :</l>
       <l n="204">The weary world is dark and wide ,</l>
       <l n="205">Lo ! I am with thee still to comfort and to guide .<span type="note_anchor">[ 102 ]</span></l>
       <l n="206">Nor fear , if , grim before thine eyes ,</l>
       <l n="207">Pale worldly Want , a spectre , lowers ;</l>
       <l n="208">What is a world of vanities</l>
       <l n="209">To a world as sweet as ours !</l>
       <l n="210">When thy heart is sad and lone , 210</l>
       <l n="211">And loves to dwell on pleasures flown ,</l>
       <l n="212">When that heart no more shall bound</l>

       <l n="26">Of the gray thistle , ere the autumnal shower</l>
       <l n="27">Steals soft , and mars his pastime ; to the King</l>

       <l n="30">Sylph of the Summer Gale , on thee I call ! 30</l>
       <l n="31">Oh , come , when now gay June is in her car ,</l>
       <l n="32">Wafting the breath of roses as she moves ;</l>
       <l n="33">Come to this garden bower , which I have hung</l>
       <l n="34">With tendrils , and the fragrant eglantine ,</l>
       <l n="35">And mandrake , rich with many mantling stars !</l>
       <l n="36">‘ Tis pleasant , when thy breath is on the leaves</l>
       <l n="37">Without , to rest in this embowering shade ,</l>
       <l n="38">And mark the green fly , circling to and fro ,</l>
       <l n="39">O'er the still water , with his dragon wings ,</l>
       <l n="40">Shooting from bank to bank , now in quick turns , 40</l>
       <l n="41">Then swift athwart , as is the gazer 's glance ,</l>
       <l n="42">Pursuing still his mate ; they , with delight ,</l>
       <l n="43">As if they moved in morris , to the sound</l>
       <l n="44">Harmonious of this ever-dripping rill ,</l>
       <l n="45">Now in advance , now in retreat , now round ,</l>

       <l n="48">But thou ,</l>
       <l n="49">Sylph of the Summer Gale , delay a while</l>
       <l n="50">Thy airy flight , whilst here Francesca leans , 50</l>
       <l n="51">And , charmed by Ossian 's harp , seems in the breeze</l>
       <l n="52">To hear Malvina 's plaint ; thou to her ear</l>
       <l n="53">Come unperceived , like music of the song</l>
       <l n="54">From Cona 's vale of streams ; then with the bee ,</l>
       <l n="55">That sounds his horn , busied from flower to flower ,</l>
       <l n="56">Speed o'er the yellow meadows , breathing ripe</l>
       <l n="57">Their summer incense ; or amid the furze ,</l>
       <l n="58">That paints with bloom intense the upland crofts ,</l>
       <l n="59">With momentary essence tinge thy wings ;</l>
       <l n="60">Or in the grassy lanes , one after one , 60</l>
       <l n="61">Lift light the nodding foxglove 's purple bell .</l>
       <l n="62">Thence , to the distant sea , and where the flag</l>
       <l n="63">Hangs idly down , without a wavy curl ,</l>
       <l n="64">Thou hoverest o'er the topmast , or dost raise</l>
       <l n="65">The full and flowing mainsail : Steadily ,</l>
       <l n="66">The helmsman cries , as now thy breath is heard</l>
       <l n="67">Among the stirring cordage o'er his head ;</l>
       <l n="68">So , steadily , he cries , as right he steers ,</l>
       <l n="69">Speeds our proud ship along the world of waves .</l>
       <l n="70">Sylph , may thy favouring breath more gently blow , 70</l>
       <l n="71">More gently round the temples and the cheek</l>
       <l n="72">Of him , who , leaving home and friends behind ,</l>
       <l n="73">In silence musing o'er the ocean leans ,</l>
       <l n="74">And watches every passing shade that marks</l>
       <l n="75">The southern Channel 's fast-retiring line ;</l>
       <l n="76">Then , as the ship rolls on , keeps a long look</l>

       <l n="78">Of that delightful country , where he left</l>
       <l n="79">All his fond hopes behind : it lessens still ;</l>
       <l n="80">Still , still it lessens , and now disappears ! 80</l>
       <l n="81">He turns , and only sees the waves that rock</l>
       <l n="82">Boundless . How many anxious morns shall rise ,</l>
       <l n="83">How many moons shall light the farthest seas ,</l>
       <l n="84">O'er what new scenes and regions shall he stray ,</l>
       <l n="85">A weary man , still thinking of his home ,</l>
       <l n="86">Ere he again that shore shall view , and greet</l>
       <l n="87">With blissful thronging hopes and starting tears ,</l>
       <l n="88">Of heartfelt welcome , and of warmest love !</l>

     <p>THE SPIRIT OF DISCOVERY BY SEA :</p>
     <p>A DESCRIPTIVE AND HISTORICAL POEM .</p>
     <p>INTRODUCTION .<span type="note_anchor">[ 152 ]</span></p>
     <p>I need not perhaps inform the reader , that I had before written a Canto on the subject of this poem ; but I was dissatisfied with the metre , and felt the necessity of some connecting idea that might give it a degree of unity and coherence .</p>
     <p>This difficulty I considered as almost inseparable from the subject ; I therefore relinquished the design of making an extended poem on events , which , though highly interesting and poetical , were too unconnected with each other to unite properly in one regular whole . But on being kindly permitted to peruse the sheets of Mr Clarke 's valuable work on the History of Navigation , I conceived ( without supposing historically with him that all ideas of navigation were derived from the ark of Noah ) that I might adopt the circumstance poetically , as capable of furnishing an unity of design ; besides which , it had the advantage of giving a more serious cast and character to the whole .</p>
     <p>To obviate such objections as might be made by those who , from an inattentive survey , might imagine there was any carelessness of arrangement , I shall lay before the reader a general analysis of the several books ; and , I trust , he will readily perceive a leading principle , on which the poem begins , proceeds , and ends .</p>
     <p>I feel almost a necessity for doing this in justice to myself , as some compositions have been certainly misunderstood , where the connexion might , by the least attention , have been perceived . In going over part of the same ground which I had taken before , I could not always avoid the use of similar expressions .</p>
     <p>I trust I need not apologise for having , in some instances , departed from strict historical facts . It is not true that Camoens sailed with De Gama , though , from the authority of Voltaire , it has been sometimes supposed that he did . There are other circumstances for which I may have less reason to expect pardon . The Egyptians were never , or but for a short time , a maritime nation . In answer to this , I must say , that history and poetry are two things ; and though the poet has no right to contradict the historian , yet , if he find two opinions upon points of history , he may certainly take that which is most susceptible of poetical ornament ; particularly if it have sufficient plausibility , and the sanction of respectable names .</p>
     <p>In deducing the first maritime attempts from Thebes , so called from Thebaoth , the Ark , founded by the sons of Cush , who first inhabited the caves on the granite mountains of Ethiopia , I have followed the idea of Bruce , which has many testimonies , particularly that of Herodotus , in its favour . In making the ships of Ammon first pass the straits of Babelmandel , and sail to Ophir , I have the authority of Sir Isaac Newton . But still these points must , from their nature , be obscure ; the poet , however , has a right to build upon them , whilst what he advances is not in direct contradiction to all historical admitted facts . He may take what is shadowy , if it be plausible , poetical , and coherent with his general plan . Having said ingenuously thus much , I hope I shall not be severely accused for having admitted , en passant , some ideas ( which may be thought visionary ) in the notes , respecting the allusion to the ark in Theocritus , the situation of Ophir , the temple of Solomon , and the algum-tree .</p>
     <p>I must also submit to the candour of the critic , the necessity I sometimes felt myself under of varying the verse , and admitting , when the subject seemed particularly to require it , a break into the measure . He will consider , as this poem is neither didactic , nor epic , that might lead on the mind by diversity of characters , and of prospects ; it was therefore necessary ( at least I thought myself at liberty so to do ) to break the uniformity of the subject by digression , contrast , occasional change of verse , et cet . But after all , at a time so unfavourable to long poems , I doubt whether the reader will have patience to accompany me to the end of my circumnavigation . If he do , and if this much larger poetical work than I have ever attempted should be as favourably received as what I have before published has been , I shall sincerely rejoice .</p>
     <p>At all events , in an age which I think has produced genuine poetry , if I cannot say “ Ed Io , anchi , sono pittore ; ” it will be a consolation to me to reflect , that I have no otherwise courted the muse , than as the consoler of sorrow , the painter of scenes romantic and interesting , the handmaid of good sense , unadulterated feelings , and religious hope .</p>
     <p>It was at first intended that the poem should consist of six books ; one book being assigned to De Gama , and another to Columbus . These have been compressed . I was the more inclined to this course , as the great subject of the DISCOVERY OF AMERICA is in the hands of such poets as Mr Southey and Mr Rogers .</p>

     <p>ANALYSIS .</p>
     <p>BOOK THE FIRST .</p>
     <p>The book opens with the resting of the Ark on the mountains of the great Indian Caucasus , considered by many authors as Ararat : the present state of the inhabited world , contrasted with its melancholy appearance immediately after the flood . The poem returns to the situation of our forefathers on leaving the ark ; beautiful evening described . The Angel of Destruction appears to Noah in a dream , and informs him that although he and his family alone have escaped , the VERY ARK , which was the means of his present preservation , shall be the cause of the future triumph of Destruction .</p>
     <p>In his dream , the evils in consequence of the discovery of America , the slave-trade , et cet ., are set before him . Noah , waking from disturbed sleep , ascends the summit of Caucasus . An angel appears to him ; tells him that the revelations in his dream were PERMITTED BY THE ALMIGHTY ; that he is commissioned to explain everything ; he presents to his view the shadow of the world as it exists ; regions are pointed out ; the dispersion of mankind ; the rise of superstition ; the birth of a SAVIOUR , and the triumph of Charity : that navigation shall be the means of extending the knowledge of GOD over the globe ; and though some evils must take place , happiness and love shall finally prevail upon the earth .</p>
     <p>BOOK THE SECOND</p>
     <p>Commences with an ardent wish , that as our forefather viewed the world clearly displayed before him in a vision , so we of these late days might be able , through the clouds of time , to look back upon the early ages of the globe ; we might then see , in their splendour , Thebes , Edom , et cet . ; but the early history of mankind is obscure , the only certain light is from the sacred writings . By these we are informed of the dispersion of earth 's first inhabitants , after the flood . The descendants of HAM , after this dispersion , according to Bruce , having first gained the summits of the Ethiopian mountains , there form subterraneous abodes . In process of time they descend , people Egypt , build Thebes ; obscure tradition of the Ark ; first make voyages .</p>
     <p>Ophir is not long afterwards discovered . This Bruce places , on most respectable authority , at Sofala ; I have ventured to place it otherwhere , but still admitting one general idea , that when the way to it overland was attended with difficulties , an easier course was at last opened by sea . As to Ammon 's exploits , I must shelter myself under the authority of Sir Isaac Newton . After a sacrifice by the Egyptians , the monsoon sets in . The ships follow its direction , as the mariners imagine a god leads them . Hence the discovery of so much of the world by sea . Reflection on commerce . The voyage of Solomon . A description of the glory of TYRE , the most commercial mart of the early world . Tyrian discoveries in the Mediterranean ; voyages to the coast of Italy and Spain , to the Straits , and from thence to Britain .</p>
     <p>Tyre is destroyed , and the thought naturally arises , that Britain , which , at the time of the splendour of the maritime Tyrians , was an obscure island , is now at the summit of maritime renown ; while TYRE is a place where only “ the fisherman dries his net . ” This leads to an EULOGIUM ON ENGLAND ; and the book concludes with the triumphs of her fleets and armies on that very shore , on which science , and art , and commerce , and MARITIME RENOWN , first arose .</p>
     <p>This digression , introducing the siege of Acre , appeared to the author not only natural , but in some measure necessary to break the uniformity of the subject .</p>
     <p>BOOK THE THIRD</p>
     <p>Commences with the feelings excited by the conclusion of the last , by a warm wish that England may for ages retain her present elevated rank . This leads to the consideration of her NAVAL OPULENCE , which carries us back to the subject we had left — THE FATE OF TYRE .</p>
     <p>The history of the empires succeeding Tyre is touched on : the fall of her destroyer , Babylon ; the succession of Cyrus ; the character of Cyrus , and his want of enlarged policy , having so many means of encouraging commerce ; and his ill-fated expedition to the East Indies .</p>
     <p>ALEXANDER THE GREAT first conceives the idea of establishing a vast MARITIME EMPIRE : in his march of conquest , he proceeds to the last river of the Punjab , the Hyphasis , which descends into the Indus , the sources of which are near the mountains of CAUCASUS , WHERE THE ARK RESTED .</p>
     <p>The Indian account of the Deluge , it is well known , resembles most wonderfully the history of Moses . When Alexander can proceed no further , poetical fiction introduces the person of a Brahmin , who relates the history of the Deluge : viz ., that one sacred man was , in this part of the world , miraculously preserved by an ark ; the further march of the conqueror towards the holy spot is deprecated : his best glory shall be derived from the sea , and from uniting either world in commerce . Alexander is animated with the idea ; and his fleet , under Nearchus , proceeds down the Indus to the sea . This forms a middle , connected with the account of the Deluge , book first .</p>
     <p>BOOK THE FOURTH .</p>
     <p>Nearchus ’ voyage being accomplished , and Alexandria now complete , Commerce is represented as standing on the Pharos , and calling to all nations . The tide of commerce would have flowed still in the track pointed out by the sagacity of Alexander , but that a wider scene , beyond THE ANCIENT WORLD , opens to the VIEW OF DISCOVERY . The use of the magnet is discovered ; and Henry of Portugal prosecutes the plan of opening a passage along the coast of Africa to the East . One of his ships on its return from the expedition has been driven from Cape Bojador ( the formidable boundary of Portuguese research ) by a storm at sea . The isle afterwards called Porto Santo is discovered . The circumstance related ; but the extraordinary appearance of a supernatural shade over the waters at a distance excites many fears and superstitions . The attempt , however , to penetrate the mystery , is resolved on . Zarco reaches the island of Madeira ; tomb found ; which introduces the episode . At the tomb of the first discoverer ( whether this be fanciful or not , is nothing to poetry ) the Spirit of Discovery casts her eyes over the globe ; she pursues De Gama to the East ; history of Camoens touched on ; Columbus ; sees with triumph the discovery of a new world , and from thence extends her ideas till the great globe is encompassed ; after which she returns to the “ tranquil bosom of the Thames , ” with Drake , the first circumnavigator , whose ship , after its various perils , being laid up in that river , gives rise to some brief concluding reflections .</p>
     <p>BOOK THE FIFTH .</p>
     <p>Hitherto we have described only the triumphs of Discovery ; but it appears necessary that many incidental evils , special and general , should be mentioned . Fate and miserable end of some great commanders ,— of our gallant and benevolent countryman , Cook . After the natural feelings of regret , the mind is led to contemplate the great advantages of his voyages : the health of seamen ; the accessions to geographical knowledge ; the spirit of humanity and science ; his exploring the east part of New-Holland ; and being the first to determine the proximity of America to Asia . This circumstance leads us back from the point whence we set out — THE ARK OF NOAH ; and hence we are partly enabled to solve , what has been for so many ages unknown , the difficulty { g } respecting the earth 's being peopled from one family .</p>
     <p>The poem having thus gained a middle and end , the conclusion of the whole is , that as this uncertainty in the physical world has been by DISCOVERY cleared up , so all the apparent contradictions in the moral world shall be reconciled . We have yet many existing evils to deplore ; but when the SUPREME DISPOSER 's plan shall have been completed , then the earth , which has been explored and enlightened by discovery and knowledge , shall be destroyed ; but the MIND OF MAN , rendered at last perfect , shall endure through all ages , and “ justify His ways from whom it sprung . ”</p>
     <p>Such is the outline and plan of the following poem . I have felt myself obliged to give this hasty analysis , thinking that self-defence almost required it , lest a careless reader might charge me with carelessness of arrangement .</p>
     <p>I must again beg it to be remembered , that History and Poetry are two things ; and that the poet has a right to build his system , not on what is exact truth , but on what is , at least , plausible ; what will form , in the clearest manner , a WHOLE ; and what is most susceptible of poetical ornament .</p>

       <l n="48">The ancient sceptre of his dread domain !</l>
       <l n="49">All was one waste of waves , that buried deep</l>
       <l n="50">Earth and its multitudes : the Ark alone , 50</l>
       <l n="51">High on the cloudy van of Ararat ,</l>
       <l n="52">Rested ; for now the death-commissioned storm</l>
       <l n="53">Sinks silent , and the eye of day looks out</l>
       <l n="54">Dim through the haze ; while short successive gleams</l>
       <l n="55">Flit o'er the weltering Deluge as it shrinks ,</l>
       <l n="56">Or the transparent rain-drops , falling few ,</l>

       <l n="80">Here let us pause . 80</l>
       <l n="81">No noise in the vast circuit of the globe</l>
       <l n="82">Is heard ; no sound of human stirring : none</l>
       <l n="83">Of pasturing herds , or wandering flocks ; nor song</l>
       <l n="84">Of birds that solace the forsaken woods</l>
       <l n="85">From morn till eve ; save in that spot that holds</l>

       <l n="88">The fleet horse bounds , high-neighing to the wind</l>

       <l n="90">Loud sings the lark amid the rainbow 's hues ; 90</l>
       <l n="91">The lion lifts him muttering ; MAN comes forth —</l>
       <l n="92">He kneels upon the earth — he kisses it ;</l>
       <l n="93">And to the GOD who stretched that radiant bow ,</l>
       <l n="94">He lifts his trembling transports .</l>
       <l n="95">From one spot</l>
       <l n="96">Alone of earth such sounds ascend . How changed</l>

       <l n="99">Flung to the stormy main , man 's murmuring race ,</l>
       <l n="100">Various and countless as the shells that strew 100</l>
       <l n="101">The ocean 's winding marge , are spread ; from shores</l>
       <l n="102">Sinensian , where the passing proas gleam</l>

       <l n="111">Dreariest of lands , and the poor Pecherais<span type="note_anchor">[ 155 ]</span></l>
       <l n="112">Shiver and moan along its waste of snows .</l>
       <l n="113">So stirs the earth ; and for the Ark that passed</l>
       <l n="114">Alone and darkling o'er the dread abyss ,</l>
       <l n="115">Ten thousand and ten thousand barks are seen</l>
       <l n="116">Fervent and glancing on the friths and sounds ;</l>
       <l n="117">From the Bermudian that , with masts inclined ,</l>
       <l n="118">Shoots like a dart along ; to the tall ship</l>
       <l n="119">That , like a stately swan , in conscious pride</l>
       <l n="120">Breasts beautiful the rising surge , and throws 120</l>
       <l n="121">The gathered waters back , and seems to move</l>
       <l n="122">A living thing , along her lucid way</l>
       <l n="123">Streaming in white-winged glory to the sun !</l>
       <l n="124">Some waft the treasures of the east ; some bear</l>
       <l n="125">Their country 's dark artillery o'er the surge</l>
       <l n="126">Frowning ; some in the southern solitudes ,</l>
       <l n="127">Bound on discovery of new regions , spread ,</l>
       <l n="128">‘ Mid rocks of driving ice , that crash around ,</l>
       <l n="129">Their weather-beaten mainsail ; or explore</l>
       <l n="130">Their perilous way from isle to isle , and wind 130</l>
       <l n="131">The tender social tie ; connecting man ,</l>
       <l n="132">Wherever scattered , with his fellow-man .</l>
       <l n="133">How many ages rolled away ere thus ,</l>
       <l n="134">From NATURE 'S GENERAL WRECK , the world 's great scene</l>
       <l n="135">Was tenanted ! See from their sad abode ,</l>
       <l n="136">At Heaven 's dread voice , heard from the solitude ,</l>
       <l n="137">As in the dayspring of created things ,</l>
       <l n="138">The sad survivors of a buried world</l>
       <l n="139">Come forth ; on them , though desolate their seat ,</l>
       <l n="140">The sky looks down with smiles ; for the broad sun , 140</l>
       <l n="141">That to the west slopes his untired career ,</l>

       <l n="143">Now rising from his evening sacrifice ,</l>
       <l n="144">Amid his offspring stands , and lifts his eyes ,</l>
       <l n="145">Moist with a tear , to the bright bow : the fire</l>
       <l n="146">Yet on the altar burns , whose trailing fume</l>
       <l n="147">Goes slowly up , and marks the lucid cope</l>
       <l n="148">Of the soft sky , where distant clouds hang still</l>
       <l n="149">And beautiful . So placid Evening steals</l>
       <l n="150">After the lurid storm , like a sweet form 150</l>
       <l n="151">Of fairy following a perturbed shape</l>
       <l n="152">Of giant terror , that in darkness strode .</l>
       <l n="153">Slow sinks the lord of day ; the clustering clouds</l>
       <l n="154">More ardent burn ; confusion of rich hues ,</l>
       <l n="155">Crimson , and gold , and purple , bright , inlay</l>
       <l n="156">Their varied edges ; till before the eye ,</l>
       <l n="157">As their last lustre fades , small silver stars</l>
       <l n="158">Succeed ; and twinkling each in its own sphere ,</l>
       <l n="159">Thick as the frost 's unnumbered spangles , strew</l>
       <l n="160">The slowly-paling heavens . Tired Nature seems 160</l>
       <l n="161">Like one who , struggling long for life , had beat</l>
       <l n="162">The billows , and scarce gained a desert crag ,</l>
       <l n="163">O'erhYpppHeNspent , to sink to rest : the tranquil airs</l>
       <l n="164">Whisper repose . Now sunk in sleep reclines</l>
       <l n="165">The Father of the world ; then the sole moon</l>
       <l n="166">Mounts high in shadowy beauty ; every cloud</l>
       <l n="167">Retires , as in the blue space she moves on</l>
       <l n="168">Amid the fulgent orbs supreme , and looks</l>
       <l n="169">The queen of heaven and earth . Stilly the streams</l>
       <l n="170">Retiring sound ; midnight 's high hollow vault 170</l>
       <l n="171">Faint echoes ; stilly sound the distant streams .</l>
       <l n="172">When , hark ! a strange and mingled wail , and cries</l>
       <l n="173">As of ten thousand thousand perishing !</l>
       <l n="174">A phantom , ‘ mid the shadows of the dead ,</l>
       <l n="175">Before the holy Patriarch , as he slept ,</l>
       <l n="176">Stood terrible :— Dark as a storm it stood</l>
       <l n="177">Of thunder and of winds , like hollow seas</l>
       <l n="178">Remote ; meantime a voice was heard : Behold ,</l>
       <l n="179">Noah , the foe of thy weak race ! my name</l>
       <l n="180">Destruction , whom thy sons in yonder plains 180</l>
       <l n="181">Shall worship , and all grim , with mooned horns</l>
       <l n="182">Paint fabling : when the flood from off the earth</l>
       <l n="183">Before it swept the living multitudes ,</l>
       <l n="184">I rode amid the hurricane ; I heard</l>
       <l n="185">The universal shriek of all that lived .</l>
       <l n="186">In vain they climbed the rocky heights : I struck</l>
       <l n="187">The adamantine mountains , and like dust</l>
       <l n="188">They crumbled in the billowy foam . My hall ,</l>
       <l n="189">Deep in the centre of the seas , received</l>
       <l n="190">The victims as they sank ! Then , with dark joy , 190</l>
       <l n="191">I sat amid ten thousand carcases ,</l>
       <l n="192">That weltered at my feet ! But THOU and THINE</l>
       <l n="193">Have braved my utmost fury : what remains</l>
       <l n="194">But vengeance , vengeance on thy hated race ;—</l>
       <l n="195">And be that sheltering shrine the instrument !</l>
       <l n="196">Thence , taught to stem the wild sea when it roars ,</l>
       <l n="197">In after-times to lands remote , where roamed</l>
       <l n="198">The naked man and his wan progeny ,</l>
       <l n="199">They , more instructed in the fatal use</l>
       <l n="200">Of arts and arms , shall ply their way ; and thou 200</l>
       <l n="201">Wouldst bid the great deep cover thee to see</l>
       <l n="202">The sorrows of thy miserable sons :</l>
       <l n="203">But turn , and view in part the truths I speak .</l>
       <l n="204">He said , and vanished with a dismal sound</l>
       <l n="205">Of lamentation from his grisly troop .</l>
       <l n="206">Then saw the just man in his dream what seemed</l>
       <l n="207">A new and savage land : huge forests stretched</l>
       <l n="208">Their world of wood , shading like night the banks</l>
       <l n="209">Of torrent-foaming rivers , many a league</l>
       <l n="210">Wandering and lost in solitudes ; green isles 210</l>
       <l n="211">Here shone , and scattered huts beneath the shade</l>
       <l n="212">Of branching palms were seen ; whilst in the sun</l>
       <l n="213">A naked infant playing , stretched his hand</l>

       <l n="259">Celestial , and with heavenly accent said :</l>

       <l n="400">The mercies they receive : that such , indeed , 400</l>
       <l n="401">On whom the light of clearer knowledge beams ,</l>

       <l n="303">Whose painted natives roamed their woody wilds ,</l>
       <l n="304">From all the world cut off , that wondering marked</l>
       <l n="305">Her stately sails approach , now in her turn</l>
       <l n="306">Rises a star of glory in the West —</l>
       <l n="307">Albion , the wonder of the illumined world !</l>
       <l n="308">See there a Newton wing the highest heavens ;</l>
       <l n="309">See there a Herschell 's daring hand withdraw</l>

      <head>BOOK THE THIRD .</head>
      <head>My heart has sighed in secret , when I thought That the dark tide of time might one day close , England , o'er thee , as long since it has closed On Egypt and on Tyre : that ages hence , From the Pacific 's billowy loneliness , Whose tract thy daring search revealed , some isle Might rise in green-haired beauty eminent , And like a goddess , glittering from the deep , Hereafter sway the sceptre of domain From pole to pole ; and such as now thou art , 10 Perhaps NEW-HOLLAND be . For who shall say What the OMNIPOTENT ETERNAL ONE , That made the world , hath purposed ! Thoughts like these , Though visionary , rise ; and sometimes move A moment 's sadness , when I think of thee , My country , of thy greatness , and thy name , Among the nations ; and thy character ,— Though some few spots be on thy flowing robe ,— Of loveliest beauty : I have never passed Through thy green hamlets on a summer 's morn , 20 Nor heard thy sweet bells ring , nor seen the youths And smiling maidens of thy villages , Gay in their Sunday tire , but I have said , With passing tenderness — Live , happy land , Where the poor peasant feels his shed , though small , An independence and a pride , that fill His honest heart with joy — joy such as they Who crowd the mart of men may never feel ! Such , England , is thy boast . When I have heard The roar of ocean bursting ‘ round thy rocks , 30 Or seen a thousand thronging masts aspire , Far as the eye could reach , from every port Of every nation , streaming with their flags O'er the still mirror of the conscious Thames ,— Yes , I have felt a proud emotion swell That I was British-born ; that I had lived A witness of thy glory , my most loved And honoured country ; and a silent prayer Would rise to Heaven , that Fame and Peace , and Love And Liberty , might walk thy vales , and sing 40 Their holy hymns , while thy brave arm repelled Hostility , even as thy guardian cliffs Repel the dash of that dread element Which calls me , lingering on the banks of Thames , On to my destined voyage , by the shores Of Asia , and the wreck of cities old , Ere yet we burst into the wilder deep With Gama ; or the huge Atlantic waste With bold Columbus stem ; or view the bounds Of field-ice , stretching to the southern pole , 50 With thee , benevolent , lamented Cook ! Tyre be no more ! said the ALMIGHTY voice : But thou too , Monarch of the world ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 173 ]</span>whose arm Rent the proud bulwarks of the golden queen Of cities , throned upon her subject seas , ART THOU TOO FALL'N ? The whole earth is at rest : “ They break forth into singing : ” Lebanon Waves all his hoary pines , and seems to say , No feller now comes here ; HELL from beneath 60 Is moved to meet thy coming ; it stirs up The DEAD for thee ; the CHIEF ONES of the earth , Tyre and the nations , they all speak and say — Art thou become like us ! Thy pomp brought down E'en to the dust ! The noise of viols ceased , The worm spread under thee , the crawling worm To cover thee ! How art thou fall'n from heaven , Son of the morning ! In thy heart thou saidst , I will ascend to Heaven ; I will exalt My throne above the stars of God ! Die — die , 70 Blasphemer ! As a carcase under foot , Defiled and trodden , so be thou cast out ! And SHE , the great , the guilty Babel — SHE Who smote the wasted cities , and the world Made as a wilderness — SHE , in her turn , Sinks to the gulf oblivious at the voice Of HIM who sits in judgment on her crimes ! Who , o'er her palaces and buried towers , Shall bid the owl hoot , and the bittern scream ; And on her pensile groves and pleasant shades 80 Pour the deep waters of forgetfulness . On that same night , when with a cry she fell , ( Like her own mighty idol dashed to earth ,) There was a strange eclipse , and long laments Were heard , and muttering thunders o'er the towers Of the high palace where his wassail loud Belshazzar kept , mocking the GOD OF HEAVEN , And flushed with impious mirth ; for BEL had left With sullen shriek his golden shrine , and sat , With many a gloomy apparition girt , 90 NISROCH and NEBO chief , in the dim sphere Of mooned ASTORETH , whose orb now rolled In darkness :— They their earthly empire mourned ; Meantime the host of Cyrus through the night Silent advanced more nigh ; and at that hour , In the torch-blazing hall of revelry , The fingers of a shadowy hand distinct Came forth , and unknown figures marked the wall , Searing the eye-balls of the starting king : Tyre is avenged ; Babel is fall'n , is fall'n ! 100 Bel and her gods are shattered ! PRINCE , to thee Called by the voice of God to execute His will on earth , and raised to Persia 's throne , CYRUS , all hearts pay homage . Touched with tints Most clear by the historian 's magic art , Thy features wear a gentleness and grace Unlike the stern cold aspect and the frown Of the dark chiefs of yore , the gloomy clan Of heroes , from humanity and love 110 Removed : To thee a brighter character Belongs — high dignity , unbending truth — Yet Nature ; not that lordly apathy Which confidence and human sympathy Represses , but a soul that bids all hearts Smiling approach . We almost burn in thought To kiss the hand that loosed Panthea 's chains , And bless him with a parent 's , husband 's tear , Who stood a guardian angel in distress To the unfriended , and the beautiful , 120 Consigned a helpless slave . Thy portrait , touched With tints of softest light , thus wins all hearts To love thee ; but severer policy , Cyrus , pronounces otherwise : she hears No stir of commerce on the sullen marge Of waters that along thy empire 's verge Beat cheerless ; no proud moles arise ; no ships , Freighted with Indian wealth , glide o'er the main From cape to cape . But on the desert sands Hurtles thy numerous host , seizing , in thought 130 Rapacious , the rich fields of Hindostan , As the poor savage fells the blooming tree To gain its tempting fruit ; but woe the while ! For in the wilderness the noise is lost Of all thy archers ;— they have ceased ;— the wind Blows o'er them , and the voice of judgment cries : So perish they who grasp with avarice Another 's blessed portion , and disdain That interchange of mutual good , that crowns The slow , sure toil of commerce . 140 It was thine , Immortal son of Macedon ! to hang In the high fane of maritime renown The fairest trophies of thy fame , and shine , THEN only like a god , when thy great mind Swayed in its master council the deep tide Of things , predestining th ’ eventful roll Of commerce , and uniting either world , Europe and Asia , in thy vast design . Twas when the victor , in his proud career , 150 O'er ravaged Hindostan , had now advanced Beyond Hydaspes ; on the flowery banks Of Hyphasis , with banners thronged , his camp Was spread . On high he bade the altars rise , The awful records to succeeding years Of his long march of glory , and to point The spot where , like the thunder rolled away , His army paused . Now shady eve came down ; The trumpet sounded to the setting sun , That looked from his illumed pavilion , calm 160 Upon the scene of arms , as if , all still , And lovely as his parting light , the world Beneath him spread ; nor clangours , nor deep groans , Were heard , nor victory 's shouts , nor sighs , nor shrieks , Were ever wafted from a bleeding land , After the havoc of a conqueror 's sword . So calm the sun declined ; when from the woods , That shone to his last beam , a Brahmin old Came forth . His streaming beard shone in the ray , That slanted o'er his feeble frame ; his front 170 Was furrowed . To the sun 's last light he cast A look of sorrow , then in silence bowed Before the conqueror of the world . At once All , as in death , was still . The victor chief Trembled , he knew not why ; the trumpet ceased Its clangor , and the crimson streamer waved No more in folds insulting to the Lord Of the reposing world . The pallid front Of the meek man seemed for a moment calm , Yet dark and thronging thoughts appeared to swell 180 His beating heart . He paused — and then abrupt : Victor , avaunt ! he cried , Hence ! and the banners of thy pride Bear to the deep ! Behold on high Yon range of mountains mingled with the sky ! It is the place Where the great Father of the human race Rested , when all the world and all its sounds Ceased ; and the ocean that surrounds The earth , leaped from its dark abode 190 Beneath the mountains , and enormous flowed , The green earth deluging ! List , soldier , list ! And dread His might no mortal may resist . Great Bramah rested , hushed in sleep , When Hayagraiva<span type="note_anchor">[ 174 ]</span>came , With mooned horns and eyes of flame , And bore the holy Vedas<span type="note_anchor">[ 175 ]</span>to the deep . Far from the sun 's rejoicing ray , Beneath the huge abyss , the buried treasures lay . Then foamed the billowy desert wide , 200 And all that breathed — they died , Sunk in the rolling waters : such the crime And violence of earth . But he above , Great Vishnu , moved with pitying love , Preserved the pious king , whose ark sublime Floated , in safety borne : For his stupendous horn , Blazing like gold , and many a rood Extended o'er the dismal flood , The precious freight sustained , till on the crest 210 Of Himakeel ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 176 ]</span>yon mountain high , That darkly mingles with the sky , Where many a griffin roams , the hallowed ark found rest . And Heaven decrees that here Shall cease thy slaughtering spear : Enough we bleed , enough we weep , Hence , victor , to the deep ! Ev'n now along the tide I see thy ships triumphant ride : I see the world of trade emerge 220 From ocean 's solitude ! What fury fires My breast ! The flood , the flood retires ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 177 ]</span>And owns its future sovereign ! Urge Thy destined way ; what countless pennants stream ! ( Or is it but the shadow of a dream ? ) Ev'n now old Indus hails Thy daring prows in long array , That o'er the lone seas gliding , Around the sea-gods riding , Speed to Euphrates ’ shores their destined way . 230 Fill high the bowl of mirth ! From west to east the earth Proclaims thee Lord ; shall the blue main Confine thy reign ? But tremble , tyrant ; hark in many a ring , With language dread Above thy head , The dark Assoors<span type="note_anchor">[ 178 ]</span>thy death-song sing . What mortal blow Hath laid the king of nations low ? 240 No hand : his own despair .— But shout , for the canvas shall swell to the air , Thy ships explore Unknown Persia 's winding shore , While the great dragon rolls his arms in vain . And see , uprising from the level main , A new and glorious city springs ;— Hither speed thy woven wings , That glance along the azure tide ; Asia and Europe own thy might ;— 250 The willing seas of either world unite : Thy name shall consecrate the sands , And glittering to the sky the mart of nations stands . He spoke , and rushed into the thickest wood . With flashing eyes the impatient monarch cried — Yes , by the Lybian Ammon and the gods Of Greece , thou bid'st me on , the self-same track My spirit pointed ; and , let death betide , My name shall live in glory ! At his word 260 The pines descend ; the thronging masts aspire ; The novel sails swell beauteous o'er the curves Of INDUS ; to the Moderators ’ song<span type="note_anchor">[ 179 ]</span>The oars keep time , while bold Nearchus guides Aloft the gallies . On the foremost prow The monarch from his golden goblet pours A full libation to the gods , and calls By name the mighty rivers , through whose course He seeks the sea . To Lybian Ammon loud The songs ascend ; the trumpets bray ; aloft 270 The streamers fly , whilst on the evening wave Majestic to the main the fleet descends .</head>

       <l n="1">Stand on the gleaming Pharos ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 180 ]</span>and aloud</l>
       <l n="2">Shout , Commerce , to the kingdoms of the earth ;</l>
       <l n="3">Shout , for thy golden portals are set wide ,</l>
       <l n="4">And all thy streamers o'er the surge , aloft ,</l>
       <l n="5">In pomp triumphant wave . The weary way</l>
       <l n="6">That pale Nearchus passed , from creek to creek</l>
       <l n="7">Advancing slow , no longer bounds the track</l>
       <l n="8">Of the adventurous mariner , who steers</l>
       <l n="9">Steady , with eye intent upon the stars ,</l>
       <l n="10">To Elam 's echoing port . Meantime , more high 10</l>
       <l n="11">Aspiring , o'er the Western main her towers</l>
       <l n="12">Th ’ imperial city lifts , the central mart</l>
       <l n="13">Of nations , and beneath the calm clear sky ,</l>
       <l n="14">At distance from the palmy marge , displays</l>
       <l n="15">Her clustering columns , whitening to the morn .</l>
       <l n="16">Damascus ’ fleece , Golconda 's gems , are there .</l>
       <l n="17">Murmurs the haven with one ceaseless hum ;</l>
       <l n="18">The hurrying camel 's bell , the driver 's song ,</l>
       <l n="19">Along the sands resound . Tyre , art thou fall'n ?</l>
       <l n="20">A prouder city crowns the inland sea , 20</l>
       <l n="21">Raised by his hand who smote thee ; as if thus</l>
       <l n="22">His mighty mind were swayed to recompense</l>
       <l n="23">The evil of his march through cities stormed ,</l>
       <l n="24">And regions wet with blood ! and still had flowed</l>
       <l n="25">The tide of commerce through the destined track ,</l>
       <l n="26">Traced by his mind sagacious , who surveyed</l>
       <l n="27">The world he conquered with a sage 's eye ,</l>
       <l n="28">As with a soldier 's spirit ; but a scene</l>
       <l n="29">More awful opens : ancient world , adieu !</l>
       <l n="30">Adieu , cloud-piercing pillars , erst its bounds ; 30</l>
       <l n="31">And thou , whose aged head once seemed to prop</l>
       <l n="32">The heavens , huge Atlas , sinking fast , adieu !</l>
       <l n="33">What though the seas with wilder fury rave ,</l>
       <l n="34">Through their deserted realm ; though the dread Cape ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 181 ]</span></l>
       <l n="35">Sole-frowning o'er the war of waves below ,</l>
       <l n="36">That bar the seaman 's search , horrid in air</l>
       <l n="37">Appear with giant amplitude ; his head</l>
       <l n="38">Shrouded in clouds , the tempest at his feet ,</l>
       <l n="39">And standing thus terrific , seem to say ,</l>
       <l n="40">Incensed — Approach who dare ! What though the fears 40</l>
       <l n="41">Of superstition people the vexed space</l>
       <l n="42">With spirits unblessed , that lamentations make</l>
       <l n="43">To the sad surge beyond — yet Enterprise ,</l>
       <l n="44">Not now a darkling Cyclop on the sands</l>
       <l n="45">Striding , but led by Science , and advanced</l>
       <l n="46">To a more awful height , on the wide scene</l>
       <l n="47">Looks down commanding .</l>
       <l n="48">Does a shuddering thought</l>
       <l n="49">Of danger start , as the tumultuous sea</l>
       <l n="50">Tosses below ! Calm Science , with a smile , 50</l>
       <l n="51">Displays the wondrous index , that still points ,</l>
       <l n="52">With nice vibration tremulous , to the Pole .</l>
       <l n="53">And such , she whispers , is the just man 's hope</l>
       <l n="54">In this tempestuous scene of human things ;</l>
       <l n="55">Even as the constant needle to the North</l>
       <l n="56">Still points ; so Piety and meek-eyed Faith</l>
       <l n="57">Direct , though trembling oft , their constant gaze</l>
       <l n="58">Heavenward , as to their lasting home , nor fear</l>
       <l n="59">The night , fast closing on their earthly way .</l>
       <l n="60">And guided by this index , thou shall pass 60</l>
       <l n="61">The world of seas secure . Far from all land ,</l>
       <l n="62">Where not a sea-bird wanders ; where nor star ,</l>
       <l n="63">Nor moon appears , nor the bright noonday sun ,</l>
       <l n="64">Safe in the wildering storm , as when the breeze</l>
       <l n="65">Of summer gently blows ; through day , through night ,</l>
       <l n="66">Where sink the well-known stars , and others rise</l>
       <l n="67">Slow from the South , the victor bark shall ride .</l>
       <l n="68">Henry ! thy ardent mind first pierced the gloom</l>
       <l n="69">Of dark disastrous ignorance , that sat</l>
       <l n="70">Upon the Southern wave , like the deep cloud 70</l>
       <l n="71">That lowered upon the woody skirts , and veiled</l>
       <l n="72">From mortal search , with umbrage ominous ,</l>
       <l n="73">Madeira 's unknown isle . But look ! the morn</l>
       <l n="74">Is kindled on the shadowy offing ; streaks</l>
       <l n="75">Of clear cold light on Sagres ’ battlements</l>
       <l n="76">Are cast , where Henry watches , listening still</l>
       <l n="77">To the unwearied surge ; and turning still</l>
       <l n="78">His anxious eyes to the horizon 's bounds .</l>
       <l n="79">A sail appears ; it swells , it shines : more high</l>
       <l n="80">Seen through the dusk it looms ; and now the hull 80</l>
       <l n="81">Is black upon the surge , whilst she rolls on</l>
       <l n="82">Aloft — the weather-beaten ship — and now</l>
       <l n="83">Streams by the watch-tower !</l>
       <l n="84">Zarco ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 182 ]</span>from the deep</l>
       <l n="85">What tidings ?</l>
       <l n="86">The loud storm of night prevailed ,</l>
       <l n="87">And swept our vessel from Bojador 's rocks</l>
       <l n="88">Far out to sea ; a sylvan isle<span type="note_anchor">[ 183 ]</span>received</l>
       <l n="89">Our sails ; so willed the ALMIGHTY — He who speaks ,</l>
       <l n="90">And all the waves are still ! 90</l>
       <l n="91">Hail , HENRY cried ,</l>
       <l n="92">The omen : we have burst the sole barrier ,</l>
       <l n="93">( Prosper our wishes , Father of the world ! )</l>
       <l n="94">We speed to Asia .</l>
       <l n="95">Soon upon the deep</l>
       <l n="96">The brave ship speeds again . Bojador 's rocks</l>
       <l n="97">Arise at distance , frowning o'er the surf ,</l>
       <l n="98">That boils for many a league without . Its course</l>
       <l n="99">The ship holds on ; till lo ! the beauteous isle ,</l>
       <l n="100">That shielded late the sufferers from the storm , 100</l>
       <l n="101">Springs o'er the wave again . Here they refresh</l>
       <l n="102">Their wasted strength , and lift their vows to Heaven ,</l>
       <l n="103">But Heaven denies their further search ; for ah !</l>
       <l n="104">What fearful apparition , palled in clouds ,</l>
       <l n="105">For ever sits upon the Western wave ,</l>
       <l n="106">Like night , and in its strange portentous gloom</l>
       <l n="107">Wrapping the lonely waters , seems the bounds</l>
       <l n="108">Of Nature ? Still it sits , day after day ,</l>
       <l n="109">The same mysterious vision . Holy saints !</l>
       <l n="110">Is it the dread abyss where all things cease ? 110</l>
       <l n="111">Or haply hid from mortal search , thine isle ,</l>
       <l n="112">Cipango , and that unapproached seat</l>
       <l n="113">Of peace , where rest the Christians whom the hate</l>
       <l n="114">Of Moorish pride pursued ? Whate'er it be ,</l>
       <l n="115">Zarco , thy holy courage bids thee on</l>
       <l n="116">To burst the gloom , though dragons guard the shore ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 184 ]</span></l>
       <l n="117">Or beings more than mortal pace the sands .</l>
       <l n="118">The favouring gales invite ; the bowsprit bears</l>
       <l n="119">Right onward to the fearful shade ; more black</l>
       <l n="120">The cloudy spectre towers ; already fear 120</l>
       <l n="121">Shrinks at the view aghast and breathless . Hark !</l>
       <l n="122">‘ Twas more than the deep murmur of the surge</l>
       <l n="123">That struck the ear ; whilst through the lurid gloom</l>
       <l n="124">Gigantic phantoms seem to lift in air</l>
       <l n="125">Their misty arms ; yet , yet — bear boldly on —</l>
       <l n="126">The mist dissolves ;— seen through the parting haze ,</l>
       <l n="127">Romantic rocks , like the depictured clouds ,</l>
       <l n="128">Shine out ; beneath a blooming wilderness</l>
       <l n="129">Of varied wood is spread , that scents the air ;</l>
       <l n="130">Where fruits of “ golden rind , ” thick interspersed 130</l>
       <l n="131">And pendent , through the mantling umbrage gleam</l>
       <l n="132">Inviting . Cypress here , and stateliest pine ,</l>
       <l n="133">Spire o'er the nether shades , as emulous</l>
       <l n="134">Of sole distinction where all nature smiles .</l>
       <l n="135">Some trees , in sunny glades alone their head</l>
       <l n="136">And graceful stem uplifting , mark below</l>
       <l n="137">The turf with shadow ; whilst in rich festoons</l>
       <l n="138">The flowery lianes braid their boughs ; meantime</l>
       <l n="139">Choirs of innumerous birds of liveliest song</l>
       <l n="140">And brightest plumage , flitting through the shades , 140</l>
       <l n="141">With nimble glance are seen ; they , unalarmed ,</l>
       <l n="142">Now near in airy circles sing , then speed</l>
       <l n="143">Their random flight back to their sheltering bowers ,</l>
       <l n="144">Whose silence , broken only by their song ,</l>
       <l n="145">From the foundation of this busy world ,</l>
       <l n="146">Perhaps had never echoed to the voice ,</l>
       <l n="147">Or heard the steps , of Man . What rapture fired</l>
       <l n="148">The strangers ’ bosoms , as from glade to glade</l>
       <l n="149">They passed , admiring all , and gazing still</l>
       <l n="150">With new delight ! ‘ Tis solitude around ; 150</l>
       <l n="151">Deep solitude , that on the gloom of woods</l>
       <l n="152">Primæval fearful hangs : a green recess</l>
       <l n="153">Now opens in the wilderness ; gay flowers</l>
       <l n="154">Of unknown name purple the yielding sward ;</l>
       <l n="155">The ring-dove murmurs o'er their head , like one</l>
       <l n="156">Attesting tenderest joy ; but mark the trees ,</l>
       <l n="157">Where , slanting through the gloom , the sunshine rests !</l>
       <l n="158">Beneath , a moss-grown monument appears ,</l>
       <l n="159">O'er which the green banana gently waves</l>
       <l n="160">Its long leaf ; and an aged cypress near 160</l>
       <l n="161">Leans , as if listening to the streamlet 's sound ,</l>
       <l n="162">That gushes from the adverse bank ; but pause —</l>
       <l n="163">Approach with reverence ! Maker of the world ,</l>
       <l n="164">There is a Christian 's cross ! and on the stone</l>
       <l n="165">A name , yet legible amid its moss ,—</l>
       <l n="166">Anna !</l>
       <l n="167">In that remote , sequestered spot ,</l>
       <l n="168">Shut as it seemed from all the world , and lost</l>
       <l n="169">In boundless seas , to trace a name , to mark</l>
       <l n="170">The emblems of their holy faith , from all 170</l>
       <l n="171">Drew tears ; while every voice faintly pronounced ,</l>
       <l n="172">Anna ! But thou , loved harp ! whose strings have rung</l>
       <l n="173">To louder tones , oh ! let my hand , awhile ,</l>
       <l n="174">The wires more softly touch , whilst I rehearse</l>
       <l n="175">Her name and fate , who in this desert deep ,</l>
       <l n="176">Far from the world , from friends , and kindred , found</l>
       <l n="177">Her long and last abode ; there where no eye</l>
       <l n="178">Might shed a tear on her remains ; no heart</l>
       <l n="179">Sigh in remembrance of her fate :—</l>
       <l n="180">She left 180</l>
       <l n="181">The Severn 's side , and fled with him she loved</l>
       <l n="182">O'er the wide main ; for he had told her tales</l>
       <l n="183">Of happiness in distant lands , where care</l>
       <l n="184">Comes not ; and pointing to the golden clouds</l>
       <l n="185">That shone above the waves , when evening came ,</l>
       <l n="186">Whispered — Oh , are there not sweet scenes of peace ,</l>
       <l n="187">Far from the murmurs of this cloudy mart ,—</l>
       <l n="188">Where gold alone bears sway ,— scenes of delight ,</l>
       <l n="189">Where love may lay his head upon the lap</l>
       <l n="190">Of innocence , and smile at all the toil 190</l>
       <l n="191">Of the low-thoughted throng , that place in wealth</l>
       <l n="192">Their only bliss ! Yes , there are scenes like these .</l>
       <l n="193">Leave the vain chidings of the world behind ,</l>
       <l n="194">Country , and hollow friends , and fly with me</l>
       <l n="195">Where love and peace in distant vales invite .</l>
       <l n="196">What wouldst thou here ! Oh , shall thy beauteous look</l>
       <l n="197">Of maiden innocence , thy smile of youth , thine eyes</l>
       <l n="198">Of tenderness and soft subdued desire ,</l>
       <l n="199">Thy form , thy limbs — oh , madness !— be the prey</l>
       <l n="200">Of a decrepit spoiler , and for gold ?— 200</l>
       <l n="201">Perish his treasure with him . Haste with me ;</l>
       <l n="202">We shall find out some sylvan nook , and then ,</l>
       <l n="203">If thou shouldst sometimes think upon these hills ,</l>
       <l n="204">When they are distant far , and drop a tear ,</l>
       <l n="205">Yes — I will kiss it from thy cheek , and clasp</l>
       <l n="206">Thy angel beauties closer to my breast ;</l>
       <l n="207">And whilst the winds blow o'er us , and the sun</l>
       <l n="208">Sinks beautifully down , and thy soft cheek</l>
       <l n="209">Reclines on mine , I will infold thee thus ,</l>
       <l n="210">And proudly cry , My friend — my love — my wife ! 210</l>
       <l n="211">So tempted he , and soon her heart approved ,</l>
       <l n="212">Nay wooed , the blissful dream ; and oft at eve ,</l>
       <l n="213">When the moon shone upon the wandering stream ,</l>
       <l n="214">She paced the castle 's battlements , that threw</l>
       <l n="215">Beneath their solemn shadow , and , resigned</l>
       <l n="216">To fancy and to tears , thought it most sweet</l>
       <l n="217">To wander o'er the world with him she loved .</l>
       <l n="218">Nor was his birth ignoble , for he shone</l>
       <l n="219">‘ Mid England 's gallant youth in Edward 's reign :</l>
       <l n="220">With countenance erect , and honest eye 220</l>
       <l n="221">Commanding ( yet suffused in tenderness</l>
       <l n="222">At times ) , and smiles that like the lightning played</l>
       <l n="223">On his brown cheek ,— so gently stern he stood ,</l>
       <l n="224">Accomplished , generous , gentle , brave , sincere ,—</l>
       <l n="225">Robert a Machin . But the sullen pride</l>
       <l n="226">Of haughty D'Arfet scorned all other claim</l>
       <l n="227">To his high heritage , save what the pomp</l>
       <l n="228">Of amplest wealth and loftier lineage gave .</l>
       <l n="229">Reckless of human tenderness , that seeks</l>
       <l n="230">One loved , one honoured object , wealth alone 230</l>
       <l n="231">He worshipped ; and for this he could consign</l>
       <l n="232">His only child , his aged hope , to loathed</l>
       <l n="233">Embraces , and a life of tears ! Nor here</l>
       <l n="234">His hard ambition ended ; for he sought ,</l>
       <l n="235">By secret whispers of conspiracies ,</l>
       <l n="236">His sovereign to abuse , bidding him lift</l>
       <l n="237">His arm avenging , and upon a youth</l>
       <l n="238">Of promise close the dark forgotten gates</l>
       <l n="239">Of living sepulture , and in the gloom</l>
       <l n="240">Inhume the slowly-wasting victim . 240</l>
       <l n="241">So</l>
       <l n="242">He purposed , but in vain ; the ardent youth</l>
       <l n="243">Rescued her — her whom more than life he loved ,</l>
       <l n="244">Ev'n when the horrid day of sacrifice</l>
       <l n="245">Drew nigh . He pointed to the distant bark ,</l>
       <l n="246">And while he kissed a stealing tear that fell</l>
       <l n="247">On her pale cheek , as trusting she reclined</l>
       <l n="248">Her head upon his breast , with ardour cried —</l>
       <l n="249">Be mine , be only mine ! the hour invites ;</l>
       <l n="250">Be mine , be only mine ! So won , she cast 250</l>
       <l n="251">A look of last affection on the towers</l>
       <l n="252">Where she had passed her infant days , that now</l>
       <l n="253">Shone to the setting sun . I follow thee ,</l>
       <l n="254">Her faint voice said ; and lo ! where in the air</l>
       <l n="255">A sail hangs tremulous , and soon her feet</l>
       <l n="256">Ascend the vessel 's side : The vessel glides</l>
       <l n="257">Down the smooth current , as the twilight fades ,</l>
       <l n="258">Till soon the woods of Severn , and the spot</l>
       <l n="259">Where D'Arfet ' s solitary turrets rose ,</l>
       <l n="260">Is lost ; a tear starts to her eye , she thinks 260</l>
       <l n="261">Of him whose gray head to the earth shall bend ,</l>
       <l n="262">When he speaks nothing — but be all , like death ,</l>
       <l n="263">Forgotten . Gently blows the placid breeze ,</l>
       <l n="264">And oh ! that now some fairy pinnace light</l>
       <l n="265">Might flit across the wave ( by no seen power</l>
       <l n="266">Directed , save when Love upon the prow</l>
       <l n="267">Gathered or spread with tender hand the sail ) ,</l>
       <l n="268">That now some fairy pinnace , o'er the surge</l>
       <l n="269">Silent , as in a summer 's dream , might waft</l>
       <l n="270">The passengers upon the conscious flood 270</l>
       <l n="271">To regions bright of undisturbed joy !</l>
       <l n="272">But hark !</l>
       <l n="273">The wind is in the shrouds ;— the cordage sings</l>
       <l n="274">With fitful violence ;— the blast now swells ,</l>
       <l n="275">Now sinks . Dread gloom invests the further wave ,</l>
       <l n="276">Whose foaming toss alone is seen , beneath</l>
       <l n="277">The veering bowsprit .</l>
       <l n="278">Oh , retire to rest ,</l>
       <l n="279">Maiden , whose tender heart would beat , whose cheek</l>
       <l n="280">Turn pale to see another thus exposed ! 280</l>
       <l n="281">Hark ! the deep thunder louder peals — Oh , save !—</l>
       <l n="282">The high mast crashes ; but the faithful arm</l>
       <l n="283">Of love is o'er thee , and thy anxious eye ,</l>
       <l n="284">Soon as the gray of morning peeps , shall view</l>
       <l n="285">Green Erin 's hills aspiring !</l>
       <l n="286">The sad morn</l>
       <l n="287">Comes forth ; but terror on the sunless wave</l>
       <l n="288">Still , like a sea-fiend , sits , and darkly smiles</l>
       <l n="289">Beneath the flash that through the struggling clouds</l>
       <l n="290">Bursts frequent , half revealing his scathed front , 290</l>
       <l n="291">Above the rocking of the waste that rolls</l>
       <l n="292">Boundless around .</l>
       <l n="293">No word through the long day</l>
       <l n="294">She spoke ;— another slowly came ;— no word</l>
       <l n="295">The beauteous drooping mourner spoke . The sun</l>
       <l n="296">Twelve times had sunk beneath the sullen surge ,</l>
       <l n="297">And cheerless rose again :— Ah , where are now</l>
       <l n="298">Thy havens , France ! But yet — resign not yet —</l>
       <l n="299">Ye lost seafarers — oh , resign not yet</l>
       <l n="300">All hope — the storm is passed ; the drenched sail 300</l>
       <l n="301">Shines in the passing beam ! Look up , and say —</l>
       <l n="302">Heaven , thou hast heard our prayers !</l>
       <l n="303">And lo ! scarce seen ,</l>
       <l n="304">A distant dusky spot appears ;— they reach</l>
       <l n="305">An unknown shore , and green and flowery vales ,</l>
       <l n="306">And azure hills , and silver-gushing streams ,</l>
       <l n="307">Shine forth ; a Paradise , which Heaven alone ,</l>
       <l n="308">Who saw the silent anguish of despair ,</l>
       <l n="309">Could raise in the waste wilderness of waves .</l>
       <l n="310">They gain the haven ; through untrodden scenes , 310</l>
       <l n="311">Perhaps untrodden by the foot of man</l>
       <l n="312">Since first the earth arose , they wind . The voice</l>
       <l n="313">Of Nature hails them here with music , sweet ,</l>
       <l n="314">As waving woods retired , or falling streams ,</l>
       <l n="315">Can make ; most soothing to the weary heart ,</l>
       <l n="316">Doubly to those who , struggling with their fate ,</l>
       <l n="317">And wearied long with watchings and with grief ,</l>
       <l n="318">Seek but a place of safety . All things here</l>
       <l n="319">Whisper repose and peace ; the very birds</l>
       <l n="320">That ‘ mid the golden fruitage glance their plumes , 320</l>
       <l n="321">The songsters of the lonely valley , sing —</l>
       <l n="322">Welcome from scenes of sorrow , live with us .</l>
       <l n="323">The wild wood opens , and a shady glen</l>
       <l n="324">Appears , embowered with mantling laurels high ,</l>
       <l n="325">That sloping shade the flowery valley 's side ;</l>
       <l n="326">A lucid stream , with gentle murmur , strays</l>
       <l n="327">Beneath the umbrageous multitude of leaves ,</l>
       <l n="328">Till gaining , with soft lapse , the nether plain ,</l>
       <l n="329">It glances light along its yellow bed ;—</l>
       <l n="330">The shaggy inmates of the forest lick 330</l>
       <l n="331">The feet of their new guests , and gazing stand .</l>
       <l n="332">A beauteous tree upshoots amid the glade</l>
       <l n="333">Its trembling top ; and there upon the bank</l>
       <l n="334">They rest them , while each heart o'erflows with joy .</l>
       <l n="335">Now evening , breathing richer odours sweet ,</l>
       <l n="336">Came down : a softer sound the circling seas ,</l>
       <l n="337">The ancient woods resounded , while the dove ,</l>
       <l n="338">Her murmurs interposing , tenderness</l>
       <l n="339">Awaked , yet more endearing , in the hearts</l>
       <l n="340">Of those who , severed wide from human kind , 340</l>
       <l n="341">Woman and man , by vows sincere betrothed ,</l>
       <l n="342">Heard but the voice of Nature . The still moon</l>
       <l n="343">Arose — they saw it not — cheek was to cheek</l>
       <l n="344">Inclined , and unawares a stealing tear</l>
       <l n="345">Witnessed how blissful was that hour , that seemed</l>
       <l n="346">Not of the hours that time could count . A kiss</l>
       <l n="347">Stole on the listening silence ; ne'er till now</l>
       <l n="348">Here heard ; they trembled , ev'n as if the Power</l>
       <l n="349">That made the world , that planted the first pair</l>
       <l n="350">In Paradise , amid the garden walked :— 350</l>
       <l n="351">This since the fairest garden that the world</l>
       <l n="352">Has witnessed , by the fabling sons of Greece</l>
       <l n="353">Hesperian named , who feigned the watchful guard</l>
       <l n="354">Of the scaled Dragon , and the Golden Fruit .</l>
       <l n="355">Such was this sylvan Paradise ; and here</l>
       <l n="356">The loveliest pair , from a hard world remote ,</l>
       <l n="357">Upon each other 's neck reclined ; their breath</l>
       <l n="358">Alone was heard , when the dove ceased on high</l>
       <l n="359">Her plaint ; and tenderly their faithful arms</l>
       <l n="360">Infolded each the other . 360</l>
       <l n="361">Thou , dim cloud ,</l>
       <l n="362">That from the search of men these beauteous vales</l>
       <l n="363">Hast closed , oh , doubly veil them ! But alas ,</l>
       <l n="364">How short the dream of human transport ! Here ,</l>
       <l n="365">In vain they built the leafy bower of love ,</l>
       <l n="366">Or culled the sweetest flowers and fairest fruit .</l>
       <l n="367">The hours unheeded stole ! but ah , not long —</l>
       <l n="368">Again the hollow tempest of the night</l>
       <l n="369">Sounds through the leaves ; the inmost woods resound ;</l>
       <l n="370">Slow comes the dawn , but neither ship nor sail 370</l>
       <l n="371">Along the rocking of the windy waste</l>
       <l n="372">Is seen : the dash of the dark-heaving wave</l>
       <l n="373">Alone is heard . Start from your bed of bliss ,</l>
       <l n="374">Poor victims ! never more shall ye behold</l>
       <l n="375">Your native vales again ; and thou , sweet child !</l>
       <l n="376">Who , listening to the voice of love , hast left</l>
       <l n="377">Thy friends , thy country ,— oh , may the wan hue</l>
       <l n="378">Of pining memory , the sunk cheek , the eye</l>
       <l n="379">Where tenderness yet dwells , atone ( if love</l>
       <l n="380">Atonement need , by cruelty and wrong 380</l>
       <l n="381">Beset ) , atone ev'n now thy rash resolves !</l>
       <l n="382">Ah , fruitless hope ! Day after day , thy bloom</l>
       <l n="383">Fades , and the tender lustre of thy eye</l>
       <l n="384">Is dimmed : thy form , amid creation , seems</l>
       <l n="385">The only drooping thing .</l>
       <l n="386">Thy look was soft ,</l>
       <l n="387">And yet most animated , and thy step</l>
       <l n="388">Light as the roe 's upon the mountains . Now ,</l>
       <l n="389">Thou sittest hopeless , pale , beneath the tree</l>
       <l n="390">That fanned its joyous leaves above thy head , 390</l>
       <l n="391">Where love had decked the blooming bower , and strewn</l>
       <l n="392">The sweets of summer : DEATH is on thy cheek ,</l>
       <l n="393">And thy chill hand the pressure scarce returns</l>
       <l n="394">Of him , who , agonised and hopeless , hangs</l>
       <l n="395">With tears and trembling o'er thee . Spare the sight ,—</l>
       <l n="396">She faints — she dies !—</l>
       <l n="397">He laid her in the earth ,</l>
       <l n="398">Himself scarce living , and upon her tomb</l>
       <l n="399">Beneath the beauteous tree where they reclined ,</l>
       <l n="400">Placed the last tribute of his earthly love . 400</l>

       <l n="2">He placed the rude inscription on her stone ,</l>
       <l n="3">Which he with faltering hands had graved , and soon</l>
       <l n="4">Himself beside it sunk — yet ere he died ,</l>
       <l n="5">Faintly he spoke : If ever ye shall hear ,</l>
       <l n="6">Companions of my few and evil days ,</l>
       <l n="7">Again the convent 's vesper bells , oh ! think</l>

       <l n="9">Of men should reach this far removed spot ,</l>
       <l n="10">Let sad remembrance raise an humble shrine ,</l>
       <l n="11">And virgin choirs chaunt duly o'er our grave : 430</l>
       <l n="12">Peace , peace ! His arm upon the mournful stone</l>
       <l n="13">He dropped ; his eyes , ere yet in death they closed ,</l>
       <l n="14">Turned to the name , till he could see no more</l>
       <l n="15">ANNA . His pale survivors , earth to earth ,</l>
       <l n="16">Weeping consigned his poor remains , and placed</l>
       <l n="17">Beneath the sod where all he loved was laid .</l>
       <l n="18">Then shaping a rude vessel from the woods ,</l>
       <l n="19">They sought their country o'er the waves , and left</l>
       <l n="20">Those scenes once more to deepest solitude .</l>
       <l n="21">The beauteous ponciana hung its head 440</l>
       <l n="22">O'er the gray stone ; but never human eye</l>
       <l n="23">Had mark 'd the spot , or gazed upon the grave</l>
       <l n="24">Of the unfortunate , but for the voice</l>
       <l n="25">Of ENTERPRISE , that spoke , from Sagre 's towers ,</l>
       <l n="26">Through ocean 's perils , storms , and unknown wastes —</l>

       <l n="28">Here , Discovery , pause !—</l>

       <l n="34">Shines in luxuriant beauty wide disclosed .</l>
       <l n="35">But cease thy song , presumptuous Muse !— a bard ,</l>
       <l n="36">In tones whose patriot sound shall never die ,</l>
       <l n="37">Has struck his deep shell , and the glorious theme</l>
       <l n="38">Recorded .</l>
       <l n="39">Say , what lofty meed awaits</l>
       <l n="40">The triumph of his victor conch , that swells</l>
       <l n="41">Its music on the yellow Tagus ’ side , 460</l>
       <l n="42">As when Arion , with his glittering harp</l>
       <l n="43">And golden hair , scarce sullied from the main ,</l>
       <l n="44">Bids all the high rocks listen to his voice</l>
       <l n="45">Again ! Alas , I see an aged form ,</l>
       <l n="46">An old man worn by penury , his hair</l>
       <l n="47">Blown white upon his haggard cheek , his hand</l>
       <l n="48">Emaciated , yet the strings with thrilling touch</l>
       <l n="49">Soliciting ; but the vain crowds pass by :</l>
       <l n="50">His very countrymen , whose fame his song</l>
       <l n="51">Has raised to heaven , in stately apathy 470</l>
       <l n="52">Wrapped up , and nursed in pride 's fastidious lap ,</l>
       <l n="53">Regard not . As he plays , a sable man</l>
       <l n="54">Looks up , but fears to speak , and when the song</l>
       <l n="55">Has ceased , kisses his master 's feeble hand .</l>
       <l n="56">Is that cold wasted hand , that haggard look ,</l>
       <l n="57">Thine , Camoens ? Oh , shame upon the world !</l>
       <l n="58">And is there none , none to sustain thee found ,</l>
       <l n="59">But he , himself unfriended , who so far</l>
       <l n="60">Has followed , severed from his native isles ,</l>
       <l n="61">To scenes of gorgeous cities , o'er the sea , 480</l>

       <l n="72">DISCOVERY , turn thine eyes !</l>
       <l n="73">COLUMBUS ’ toiling ship is on the deep ,</l>
       <l n="74">Stemming the mid Atlantic .</l>
       <l n="75">Waste and wild</l>
       <l n="76">The view ! On the same sunshine o'er the waves</l>
       <l n="77">The murmuring mariners , with languid eye ,</l>
       <l n="78">Ev'n till the heart is sick , gaze day by day !</l>
       <l n="79">At midnight in the wind sad voices sound !</l>
       <l n="80">When the slow morning o'er the offing dawns ,</l>
       <l n="81">Heartless they view the same drear weltering waste 500</l>
       <l n="82">Of seas : and when the sun again goes down</l>
       <l n="83">Silent , hope dies within them , and they think</l>
       <l n="84">Of parting friendship 's last despairing look !</l>
       <l n="85">See too , dread prodigy , the needle veers</l>
       <l n="86">Her trembling point — will Heaven forsake them too !</l>
       <l n="87">But lift thy sunk eye , and thy bloodless look ,</l>
       <l n="88">Despondence ! Milder airs at morning breathe :—</l>
       <l n="89">Below the slowly-parting prow the sea</l>
       <l n="90">Is dark with weeds ; and birds of land are seen</l>
       <l n="91">To wing the desert tract , as hasting on 510</l>
       <l n="92">To the green valleys of their distant home .</l>
       <l n="93">Yet morn succeeds to morn — and nought around</l>
       <l n="94">Is seen , but dark weeds floating many a league ,</l>
       <l n="95">The sun 's sole orb , and the pale hollowness</l>
       <l n="96">Of heaven 's high arch streaked with the early clouds .</l>
       <l n="97">Watchman , what from the giddy mast ?</l>
       <l n="98">A shade</l>
       <l n="99">Appears on the horizon 's hazy line .</l>
       <l n="100">Land ! land ! aloud is echoed ; but the spot</l>
       <l n="101">Fades as the shouting crew delighted gaze — 520</l>
       <l n="102">It fades , and there is nothing — nothing now</l>
       <l n="103">But the blue sky , the clouds , and surging seas !</l>
       <l n="104">As one who , in the desert , faint with thirst ,</l>
       <l n="105">Upon the trackless and forsaken sands</l>
       <l n="106">Sinks dying ; him the burning haze deceives ,</l>
       <l n="107">As mocking his last torments , while it seems ,</l>
       <l n="108">To his distempered vision , like th ’ expanse</l>
       <l n="109">Of lucid waters cool : so falsely smiles</l>
       <l n="110">Th ’ illusive land upon the water 's edge ,</l>
       <l n="111">To the long-straining eye showing what seems 530</l>
       <l n="112">Its headlands and its distant trending shores ;—</l>
       <l n="113">But all is false , and like the pensive dream</l>
       <l n="114">Of poor imagination , ‘ mid the waves</l>
       <l n="115">Of troubled life , decked with unreal hues ,</l>
       <l n="116">And ending soon in emptiness and tears .</l>
       <l n="117">‘ Tis midnight , and the thoughtful chief , retired</l>
       <l n="118">From the vexed crowd , in his still cabin hears</l>
       <l n="119">The surge that rolls below ; he lifts his eyes ,</l>
       <l n="120">And casts a silent anxious look without .</l>
       <l n="121">It is a light — great God — it is a light ! 540</l>
       <l n="122">It moves upon the shore !— Land — there is land !</l>
       <l n="123">He spoke in secret , and a tear of joy</l>
       <l n="124">Stole down his cheek , when on his knees he fell .</l>
       <l n="125">Thou , who hast been his guardian in wastes</l>
       <l n="126">Of the hoar deep , accept his tears , his prayers ;</l>
       <l n="127">While thus he fondly hopes the purer light</l>

       <l n="142">Now from the night of dark uncertainty</l>

       <l n="146">The roaming nations ? From that ancient race</l>
       <l n="147">That peopled Asia — Noah 's sons ? How , then ,</l>

       <l n="150">Cut off , and lost , for unknown ages , lost</l>

       <l n="1">Such are thy views , DISCOVERY ! The great world</l>

       <l n="3">Submits its awful empire ; Industry</l>
       <l n="4">Awakes , and Commerce to the echoing marts</l>
       <l n="5">From east to west unwearied pours her wealth .</l>
       <l n="6">Man walks sublimer ; and Humanity ,</l>
       <l n="7">Matured by social intercourse , more high ,</l>
       <l n="8">More animated , lifts her sovereign mien ,</l>
       <l n="9">And waves her golden sceptre . Yet the heart</l>
       <l n="10">Asks trembling , is no evil found ! Oh , turn , 10</l>
       <l n="11">Meek Charity , and drop a human tear</l>
       <l n="12">For the sad fate of Afric 's injured sons ,</l>
       <l n="13">And hide , for ever hide , the sight of chains ,</l>
       <l n="14">Anguish , and bondage ! Yes , the heart of man</l>
       <l n="15">Is sick , and Charity turns pale , to think</l>

       <l n="17">Dark crimes , that sullied the sweet day , pursued ,</l>
       <l n="18">Like vultures , the Discoverer 's ocean tract ,</l>

       <l n="21">The caverned mountains echoed , Gold more Gold !</l>
       <l n="22">Then see the fell-eyed , prowling buccaneer ,</l>
       <l n="23">Grim as a libbard ! He his jealous look</l>
       <l n="24">Turns to the dagger at his belt , his hand</l>
       <l n="25">By instinct grasps a bloody scymitar ,</l>
       <l n="26">And ghastly is his smile , as o'er the woods</l>
       <l n="27">He sees the smoke of burning villages</l>
       <l n="28">Ascend , and thinks ev'n now he counts his spoil .</l>
       <l n="29">See thousands destined to the lurid mine ,</l>

       <l n="39">The pale procession of the dead , from caves</l>

       <l n="41">Thy kingly sceptre , and proclaim thy might !</l>
       <l n="42">Lord of the Hurricane ! bid all thy winds</l>
       <l n="43">Swell , and destruction ride upon the surge ,</l>
       <l n="44">Where , after the red lightning flash that shows</l>
       <l n="45">The labouring ship , all is at once deep night</l>
       <l n="46">And long suspense , till the slow dawn of day</l>
       <l n="47">Gleams on the scattered corses of the dead ,</l>
       <l n="48">That strew the sounding shore !</l>
       <l n="49">Then think of him ,</l>
       <l n="50">Ye who rejoice with those you love , at eve , 50</l>
       <l n="51">When winds of winter shake the window-frame ,</l>
       <l n="52">And more endear your fire , oh , think of him ,</l>
       <l n="53">Who , saved alone from the destroying storm ,</l>
       <l n="54">Is cast on some deserted rock ; who sees</l>
       <l n="55">Sun after sun descend , and hopeless hears ;</l>
       <l n="56">At morn the long surge of the troubled main ,</l>
       <l n="57">That beats without his wretched cave ; meantime</l>
       <l n="58">He fears to wake the echoes with his voice ,</l>
       <l n="59">So dread the solitude !</l>
       <l n="60">Let Greenland 's snows 60</l>
       <l n="61">Then shine , and mark the melancholy train</l>
       <l n="62">There left to perish , whilst the cold pale day</l>
       <l n="63">Declines along the further ice , that binds</l>
       <l n="64">The ship , and leaves in night the sinking scene .</l>
       <l n="65">Sad winter closes on the deep ; the smoke</l>
       <l n="66">Of frost , that late amusive to the eye</l>
       <l n="67">Rose o'er the coast , is passed , and all is now</l>
       <l n="68">One torpid blank ; the freezing particles</l>
       <l n="69">Blown blistering , and the white bear seeks her cave .</l>
       <l n="70">Ill-fated outcasts , when the morn again 70</l>
       <l n="71">Shall streak with feeble beam the frozen waste ,</l>
       <l n="72">Your air-bleached and unburied carcases</l>
       <l n="73">Shall press the ground , and , as the stars fade off ,</l>
       <l n="74">Your stony eyes glare ‘ mid the desert snows !</l>
       <l n="75">These triumphs boast , fell Demon of the Deep !</l>
       <l n="76">Though never more the universal shriek</l>
       <l n="77">Of all that perish thou shalt hear , as when</l>
       <l n="78">The deep foundations of the guilty earth</l>
       <l n="79">Were shaken at the voice of God , and man</l>
       <l n="80">Ceased in his habitations ; yet the sea 80</l>
       <l n="81">Thy might tempestuous still , and joyless rule ,</l>
       <l n="82">Confesses . Ah ! what bloodless shadows throng</l>
       <l n="83">Ev'n now , slow rising from their oozy beds ,</l>
       <l n="84">From Mete ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 188 ]</span>and those gates of burial</l>
       <l n="85">That guard the Erythræan ; from the vast</l>
       <l n="86">Unfathomed caverns of the Western main</l>
       <l n="87">Or stormy Orcades ; whilst the sad shell</l>
       <l n="88">Of poor Arion ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 189 ]</span>to the hollow blast</l>
       <l n="89">Slow seems to pour its melancholy tones ,</l>
       <l n="90">And faintly vibrate , as the dead pass by . 90</l>
       <l n="91">I see the chiefs , who fell in distant lands ,</l>
       <l n="92">The prey of murderous savages , when yells ,</l>
       <l n="93">And shouts , and conch , resounded through the woods .</l>
       <l n="94">Magellan and De Solis seem to lead</l>
       <l n="95">The mournful train . Shade of Perouse ! oh , say</l>
       <l n="96">Where , in the tract of unknown seas , thy bones</l>
       <l n="97">Th ’ insulting surge has swept ?</l>
       <l n="98">But who is he ,</l>
       <l n="99">Whose look , though pale and bloody , wears the trace</l>
       <l n="100">Of pure philanthropy ? The pitying sigh 100</l>
       <l n="101">Forbid not ; he was dear to Britons , dear</l>
       <l n="102">To every beating heart , far as the world</l>
       <l n="103">Extends ; and my faint faltering touch ev'n now</l>
       <l n="104">Dies on the strings , when I pronounce thy name ,</l>
       <l n="105">Oh , lost , lamented , generous , hapless Cook !</l>
       <l n="106">But cease the vain complaint ; turn from the shores ,</l>
       <l n="107">Wet with his blood , Remembrance : cast thine eyes</l>
       <l n="108">Upon the long seas , and the wider world ,</l>
       <l n="109">Displayed from his research . Smile , glowing Health !</l>
       <l n="110">For now no more the wasted seaman sinks , 110</l>
       <l n="111">With haggard eye and feeble frame diseased ;</l>
       <l n="112">No more with tortured longings for the sight</l>
       <l n="113">Of fields and hillocks green , madly he calls</l>
       <l n="114">On Nature , when before his swimming eye</l>
       <l n="115">The liquid long expanse of cheerless seas</l>
       <l n="116">Seems all one flowery plain . Then frantic dreams</l>
       <l n="117">Arise ; his eye 's distemper 'd flash is seen</l>
       <l n="118">From the sunk socket , as a demon there</l>
       <l n="119">Sat mocking , till he plunges in the flood ,</l>
       <l n="120">And the dark wave goes o'er him . 120</l>

       <l n="213">More sacred , more endearing ; whilst the eye ,</l>
       <l n="214">Lifted beyond this earthly scene , beholds</l>
       <l n="215">A Father who looks down from heaven on all !</l>
       <l n="216">O Britain , my loved country ! dost thou rise</l>
       <l n="217">Most high among the nations ! Do thy fleets</l>
       <l n="218">Ride o'er the surge of ocean , that subdued</l>
       <l n="219">Rolls in long sweep beneath them ! Dost thou wear</l>
       <l n="220">Thy garb of gentler morals gracefully ! 220</l>
       <l n="221">Is widest science thine , and the fair train</l>
       <l n="222">Of lovelier arts ! While commerce throngs thy ports</l>
       <l n="223">With her ten thousand streamers , is the tract</l>
       <l n="224">Of the undeviating ploughshare white</l>
       <l n="225">That rips the reeking furrow , followed soon</l>
       <l n="226">By plenty , bidding all the scene rejoice ,</l>
       <l n="227">Even like a cultured garden ! Do the streams</l>
       <l n="228">That steal along thy peaceful vales , reflect</l>
       <l n="229">Temples , and Attic domes , and village towers !</l>
       <l n="230">Is beauty thine , fairest of earthly things , 230</l>
       <l n="231">Woman ; and doth she gain that liberal love</l>
       <l n="232">And homage , which the meekness of her voice ,</l>
       <l n="233">The rapture of her smile , commanding most</l>
       <l n="234">When she seems weakest , must demand from him ,</l>
       <l n="235">Her master ; whose stern strength at once submits</l>
       <l n="236">In manly , but endearing , confidence ,</l>
       <l n="237">Unlike his selfish tyranny who sits</l>
       <l n="238">The sultan of his harem !</l>
       <l n="239">Oh , then , think</l>
       <l n="240">How great the blessing , and how high thy rank 240</l>
       <l n="241">Amid the civilised and social world !</l>
       <l n="242">But hast thou no deep failings , that may turn</l>
       <l n="243">Thy thoughts within thyself ! Ask , for the sun</l>
       <l n="244">That shines in heaven hath seen it , hath thy power</l>
       <l n="245">Ne'er scattered sorrow over distant lands !</l>
       <l n="246">Ask of the East , have never thy proud sails</l>
       <l n="247">Borne plunder from dismembered provinces ,</l>
       <l n="248">Leaving the groans of miserable men</l>
       <l n="249">Behind ! And free thyself , and lifting high</l>
       <l n="250">The charter of thy freedom , bought with blood , 250</l>
       <l n="251">Hast thou not stood , in patient apathy ,</l>
       <l n="252">A witness of the tortures and the chains</l>
       <l n="253">That Afric 's injured sons have known ! Stand up ;</l>
       <l n="254">Yes , thou hast visited the caves , and cheered</l>
       <l n="255">The gloomy haunts of sorrow ; thou hast shed</l>
       <l n="256">A beam of comfort and of righteousness</l>
       <l n="257">On isles remote ; hast bid the bread-fruit shade</l>
       <l n="258">Th ’ Hesperian regions , and has softened much</l>
       <l n="259">With bland amelioration , and with charms</l>
       <l n="260">Of social sweetness , the hard lot of man . 260</l>
       <l n="261">But weighed in truth 's firm balance , ask , if all</l>
       <l n="262">Be even . Do not crimes of ranker growth</l>
       <l n="263">Batten amid thy cities , whose loud din ,</l>
       <l n="264">From flashing and contending cars , ascends ,</l>
       <l n="265">Till morn ! Enchanting , as if aught so sweet</l>
       <l n="266">Ne'er faded , do thy daughters wear the weeds</l>
       <l n="267">Of calm domestic peace and wedded love ;</l>
       <l n="268">Or turn , with beautiful disdain , to dash</l>
       <l n="269">Gay pleasure 's poisoned chalice from their lips</l>
       <l n="270">Untasted ! Hath not sullen atheism , 270</l>
       <l n="271">Weaving gay flowers of poesy , so sought</l>
       <l n="272">To hide the darkness of his withered brow</l>
       <l n="273">With faded and fantastic gallantry</l>
       <l n="274">Of roses , thus to win the thoughtless smile</l>
       <l n="275">Of youthful ignorance ! Hast thou with awe</l>
       <l n="276">Looked up to Him whose power is in the clouds ,</l>
       <l n="277">Who bids the storm rush , and it sweeps to earth</l>
       <l n="278">The nations that offend , and they are gone ,</l>
       <l n="279">Like Tyre and Babylon ! Well weigh thyself :</l>
       <l n="280">Then shalt thou rise undaunted in the might 280</l>
       <l n="281">Of thy Protector , and the gathered hate</l>
       <l n="282">Of hostile bands shall be but as the sand</l>
       <l n="283">Blown on the everlasting pyramid .</l>
       <l n="284">Hasten , O Love and Charity ! your work ,</l>
       <l n="285">Ev'n now whilst it is day ; far as the world</l>
       <l n="286">Extends may your divinest influence</l>
       <l n="287">Be felt , and more than felt , to teach mankind</l>
       <l n="288">They all are brothers , and to drown the cries</l>
       <l n="289">Of superstition , anarchy , or blood !</l>
       <l n="290">Not yet the hour is come : on Ganges ’ banks 290</l>
       <l n="291">Still superstition hails the flame of death ,</l>

      <head>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION .<span type="note_anchor">[ 192 ]</span></head>
       <l n="1">It is not necessary to relate the causes which induced me to publish</l>
       <l n="2">this poem without a name .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The favour with which it has been received may make me less diffident in avowing it ; and , as a second edition has been generally called for , I have endeavoured to make it , in every respect , less unworthy of the public eye .</p>
     <p>I have availed myself of every sensible objection , the most material of which was the circumstance , that the Indian maid , described in the first book , had not a part assigned to her of sufficient interest in the subsequent events of the poem , and that the character of the Missionary was not sufficiently professional .</p>
     <p>The single circumstance that a Spanish commander , with his army in South America , was destroyed by the Indians , in consequence of the treachery of his page , who was a native , and that only a priest was saved , is all that has been taken from history . The rest of this poem , the personages , father , daughter , wife , et cet . ( with the exception of the names of Indian warriors ) is imaginary . The time is two months . The first four books include as many days and nights . The rest of the time is occupied by the Spaniards ’ march , the assembly of warriors , et cet .</p>
     <p>The place in which the scene is laid , was selected because South America has of late years received additional interest , and because the ground was at once new , poetical , and picturesque .</p>
     <p>From old-fashioned feelings , perhaps , I have admitted some aërial agents , or what is called machinery . It is true that the spirits cannot be said to accelerate or retard the events ; but surely they may be allowed to show a sympathy with the fate of those , among whom poetical fancy has given them a prescriptive ideal existence . They may be further excused , as relieving the narrative , and adding to the imagery .</p>
     <p>The causes which induced me to publish this poem without a name , induced me also to attempt it in a versification to which I have been least accustomed , which , to my ear , is most uncongenial , and which is , in itself , most difficult . I mention this , in order that , if some passages should be found less harmonious than they might have been , the candour of the reader may pardon them .</p>
     <p>Scene — SOUTH AMERICA .</p>
     <p>Characters .— Valdivia , commander of the Spanish armies — Lautaro , his page , a native of Chili — Anselmo , the missionary — Indiana , his adopted daughter , wife of Lautaro — Zarinel , the wandering minstrel .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Indians .— Attacapac , father of Lautaro — Olola , his daughter , sister of</l>
       <l n="2">Lautaro — Caupolican , chief of the Indians — Indian warriors .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The chief event of the poem turns upon the conduct of Lautaro ; but as the Missionary acts so distinguished a part , and as the whole of the moral depends upon him , it was thought better to retain the title which was originally given to the poem .</p>

      <head>THE MISSIONARY .</head>
      <head>INTRODUCTION .</head>
       <l n="1">When o'er the Atlantic wild , rocked by the blast ,</l>
       <l n="2">Sad Lusitania 's exiled sovereign passed ,</l>
       <l n="3">Reft of her pomp , from her paternal throne</l>
       <l n="4">Cast forth , and wandering to a clime unknown ,</l>
       <l n="5">To seek a refuge on that distant shore ,</l>
       <l n="6">That once her country 's legions dyed with gore ;—</l>
       <l n="7">Sudden , methought , high towering o'er the flood ,</l>
       <l n="8">Hesperian world ! thy mighty genius stood ;</l>
       <l n="9">Where spread , from cape to cape , from bay to bay ,</l>
       <l n="10">Serenely blue , the vast Pacific lay ; 10</l>
       <l n="11">And the huge Cordilleras to the skies</l>
       <l n="12">With all their burning summits seemed to rise .</l>
       <l n="13">Then the stern spirit spoke , and to his voice</l>
       <l n="14">The waves and woods replied :— Mountains , rejoice !</l>
       <l n="15">Thou solitary sea , whose billows sweep</l>
       <l n="16">The margin of my forests , dark and deep ,</l>
       <l n="17">Rejoice ! the hour is come : the mortal blow ,</l>
       <l n="18">That smote the golden shrines of Mexico ,</l>
       <l n="19">In Europe is avenged ; and thou , proud Spain ,</l>
       <l n="20">Now hostile hosts insult thy own domain ; 20</l>
       <l n="21">Now Fate , vindictive , rolls , with refluent flood ,</l>
       <l n="22">Back on thy shores the tide of human blood ,</l>
       <l n="23">Think of my murdered millions ! of the cries</l>
       <l n="24">That once I heard from all my kingdoms rise ;</l>
       <l n="25">Of Famine 's feeble plaint , of Slavery 's tear ;—</l>
       <l n="26">Think , too , if Valour , Freedom , Fame , be dear ,</l>
       <l n="27">How my Antarctic sons , undaunted , stood ,</l>
       <l n="28">Exacting groan for groan , and blood for blood ;</l>
       <l n="29">And shouted , ( may the sounds be hailed by thee ! )</l>
       <l n="30">Tyrants , the virtuous and the brave are free ! 30</l>

       <l n="4">Beneath aërial cliffs , and glittering snows ,</l>
       <l n="5">The rush-roof of an aged warrior rose ,</l>
       <l n="6">Chief of the mountain tribes : high overhead ,</l>
       <l n="7">The Andes , wild and desolate , were spread ,</l>
       <l n="8">Where cold Sierras shot their icy spires ,</l>
       <l n="9">And Chillan<span type="note_anchor">[ 193 ]</span>trailed its smoke and smouldering fires .</l>
       <l n="10">A glen beneath , a lonely spot of rest ,</l>
       <l n="11">Hung , scarce discovered , like an eagle 's nest .</l>
       <l n="12">Summer was in its prime ;— the parrot-flocks</l>
       <l n="13">Darkened the passing sunshine on the rocks ; 10</l>
       <l n="14">The chrysomel<span type="note_anchor">[ 194 ]</span>and purple butterfly ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 195 ]</span></l>
       <l n="15">Amid the clear blue light , are wandering by ;</l>
       <l n="16">The humming-bird , along the myrtle bowers ,</l>
       <l n="17">With twinkling wing , is spinning o'er the flowers ,</l>
       <l n="18">The woodpecker is heard with busy bill ,</l>
       <l n="19">The mock-bird sings — and all beside is still ,</l>
       <l n="20">And look ! the cataract that bursts so high ,</l>
       <l n="21">As not to mar the deep tranquillity ,</l>
       <l n="22">The tumult of its dashing fall suspends ,</l>
       <l n="23">And , stealing drop by drop , in mist descends ; 20</l>
       <l n="24">Through whose illumined spray and sprinkling dews ,</l>
       <l n="25">Shine to the adverse sun the broken rainbow hues .</l>
       <l n="26">Chequering , with partial shade , the beams of noon ,</l>
       <l n="27">And arching the gray rock with wild festoon ,</l>
       <l n="28">Here its gay net-work , and fantastic twine ,</l>
       <l n="29">The purple cogul<span type="note_anchor">[ 196 ]</span>threads from pine to pine ,</l>
       <l n="30">And oft , as the fresh airs of morning breathe ,</l>
       <l n="31">Dips its long tendrils in the stream beneath .</l>
       <l n="32">There , through the trunks with moss and lichens white ,</l>
       <l n="33">The sunshine darts its interrupted light , 30</l>
       <l n="34">And , ‘ mid the cedar 's darksome boughs , illumes ,</l>
       <l n="35">With instant touch , the Lori 's scarlet plumes .</l>
       <l n="36">So smiles the scene ;— but can its smiles impart</l>
       <l n="37">Aught to console yon mourning warrior 's heart ?</l>
       <l n="38">He heeds not now , when beautifully bright ,</l>
       <l n="39">The humming-bird is circling in his sight ;</l>
       <l n="40">Nor ev'n , above his head , when air is still ,</l>
       <l n="41">Hears the green woodpecker 's resounding bill ;</l>
       <l n="42">But gazing on the rocks and mountains wild ,</l>
       <l n="43">Rock after rock , in glittering masses piled 40</l>
       <l n="44">To the volcano 's cone , that shoots so high</l>
       <l n="45">Gray smoke whose column stains the cloudless sky ,</l>
       <l n="46">He cries , Oh ! if thy spirit yet be fled</l>
       <l n="47">To the pale kingdoms of the shadowy dead ,—</l>
       <l n="48">In yonder tract of purest light above ,</l>
       <l n="49">Dear long-lost object of a father 's love ,</l>
       <l n="50">Dost thou abide ; or like a shadow come ,</l>
       <l n="51">Circling the scenes of thy remembered home ,</l>
       <l n="52">And passing with the breeze , or , in the beam</l>
       <l n="53">Of evening , light the desert mountain stream ! 50</l>
       <l n="54">Or at deep midnight are thine accents heard ,</l>
       <l n="55">In the sad notes of that melodious bird ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 197 ]</span></l>
       <l n="56">Which , as we listen with mysterious dread ,</l>
       <l n="57">Brings tidings from our friends and fathers dead ?</l>
       <l n="58">Perhaps , beyond those summits , far away ,</l>
       <l n="59">Thine eyes yet view the living light of day ;</l>
       <l n="60">Sad , in the stranger 's land , thou may'st sustain</l>
       <l n="61">A weary life of servitude and pain ,</l>
       <l n="62">With wasted eye gaze on the orient beam ,</l>
       <l n="63">And think of these white rocks and torrent stream , 60</l>
       <l n="64">Never to hear the summer cocoa wave ,</l>
       <l n="65">Or weep upon thy father 's distant grave .</l>
       <l n="66">Ye , who have waked , and listened with a tear ,</l>
       <l n="67">When cries confused , and clangours rolled more near ;</l>
       <l n="68">With murmured prayer , when Mercy stood aghast ,</l>
       <l n="69">As War 's black trump pealed its terrific blast ,</l>
       <l n="70">And o'er the withered earth the armed giant passed !</l>
       <l n="71">Ye , who his track with terror have pursued ,</l>
       <l n="72">When some delightful land , all blood-imbrued ,</l>
       <l n="73">He swept ; where silent is the champaign wide , 70</l>
       <l n="74">That echoed to the pipe of yester-tide ,</l>
       <l n="75">Save , when far off , the moonlight hills prolong</l>
       <l n="76">The last deep echoes of his parting gong ;</l>
       <l n="77">Nor aught is seen , in the deserted spot</l>
       <l n="78">Where trailed the smoke of many a peaceful cot ,</l>
       <l n="79">Save livid corses that unburied lie ,</l>
       <l n="80">And conflagrations , reeking to the sky ;—</l>
       <l n="81">Come listen , whilst the causes I relate</l>

       <l n="93">Fell , gently lifted , on her bosom bare ; 90</l>
       <l n="94">Her necklace shone , of sparkling insects made ,</l>
       <l n="95">That flit , like specks of fire , from sun to shade .</l>
       <l n="96">Light was her form ; a clasp of silver braced</l>
       <l n="97">The azure-dyed ichella<span type="note_anchor">[ 198 ]</span>round her waist ;</l>
       <l n="98">Her ancles rung with shells , as unconfined</l>
       <l n="99">She danced , and sung wild carols to the wind .</l>
       <l n="100">With snow-white teeth , and laughter in her eye ,</l>
       <l n="101">So beautiful in youth she bounded by .</l>
       <l n="102">Yet kindness sat upon her aspect bland ,—</l>
       <l n="103">The tame alpaca<span type="note_anchor">[ 199 ]</span>stood and licked her hand ; 100</l>
       <l n="104">She brought him gathered moss , and loved to deck</l>
       <l n="105">With flowery twine his tall and stately neck ,</l>
       <l n="106">Whilst he with silent gratitude replies ,</l>
       <l n="107">And bends to her caress his large blue eyes .</l>
       <l n="108">These children danced together in the shade ,</l>
       <l n="109">Or stretched their hands to see the rainbow fade ;</l>
       <l n="110">Or sat and mocked , with imitative glee ,</l>
       <l n="111">The paroquet , that laughed from tree to tree ;</l>
       <l n="112">Or through the forest 's wildest solitude ,</l>
       <l n="113">From glen to glen , the marmozet pursued ; 110</l>
       <l n="114">And thought the light of parting day too short ,</l>
       <l n="115">That called them , lingering , from their daily sport .</l>
       <l n="116">In that fair season of awakening life ,</l>
       <l n="117">When dawning youth and childhood are at strife ;</l>
       <l n="118">When on the verge of thought gay boyhood stands</l>
       <l n="119">Tiptoe , with glistening eye and outspread hands ;</l>
       <l n="120">With airy look , and form and footsteps light ,</l>
       <l n="121">And glossy locks , and features berry-bright ,</l>
       <l n="122">And eye like the young eaglet 's , to the ray</l>
       <l n="123">Of noon unblenching as he sails away ; 120</l>
       <l n="124">A brede of sea-shells on his bosom strung ,</l>
       <l n="125">A small stone-hatchet o'er his shoulder slung ,</l>
       <l n="126">With slender lance , and feathers blue and red ,</l>
       <l n="127">That , like the heron 's<span type="note_anchor">[ 200 ]</span>crest , waved on his head ,—</l>
       <l n="128">Buoyant with hope , and airiness , and joy ,</l>
       <l n="129">Lautaro was a graceful Indian boy :</l>
       <l n="130">Taught by his sire , ev'n now he drew the bow ,</l>
       <l n="131">Or tracked the jagguar on the morning snow ;</l>
       <l n="132">Startled the condor , on the craggy height ;</l>
       <l n="133">Then silent sat , and marked its upward flight , 130</l>
       <l n="134">Lessening in ether to a speck of white .</l>
       <l n="135">But when the impassioned chieftain spoke of war ,</l>
       <l n="136">Smote his broad breast , or pointed to a scar ,—</l>
       <l n="137">Spoke of the strangers of the distant main ,</l>
       <l n="138">And the proud banners of insulting Spain ,—</l>
       <l n="139">Of the barbed horse and iron horseman spoke ,</l>
       <l n="140">And his red gods , that , wrapped in rolling smoke ,</l>
       <l n="141">Roared from the guns ;— the boy , with still-drawn breath ,</l>
       <l n="142">Hung on the wondrous tale , as mute as death ;</l>
       <l n="143">Then raised his animated eyes , and cried , 140</l>
       <l n="144">Oh , let me perish by my father 's side !</l>
       <l n="145">Once , when the moon , o'er Chillan 's cloudless height ,</l>
       <l n="146">Poured , far and wide , its softest , mildest light ,</l>
       <l n="147">A predatory band of mailed men</l>
       <l n="148">Burst on the stillness of the sheltered glen :</l>
       <l n="149">They shouted , Death ! and shook their sabres high ,</l>
       <l n="150">That shone terrific to the moonlight sky ;</l>
       <l n="151">Where'er they rode , the valley and the hill</l>
       <l n="152">Echoed the shrieks of death , till all again was still .</l>
       <l n="153">The warrior , ere he sank in slumber deep , 150</l>
       <l n="154">Had kissed his son , soft-breathing in his sleep ,</l>
       <l n="155">Where on a Llama 's skin he lay , and said ,</l>
       <l n="156">Placing his hand , with tears , upon his head ,</l>
       <l n="157">Aërial nymphs !<span type="note_anchor">[ 201 ]</span>that in the moonlight stray ,</l>
       <l n="158">O gentle spirits ! here awhile delay ;</l>
       <l n="159">Bless , as ye pass unseen , my sleeping boy ,</l>
       <l n="160">Till blithe he wakes to daylight and to joy .</l>
       <l n="161">If the GREAT SPIRIT will , in future days ,</l>
       <l n="162">O'er the fall'n foe his hatchet he shall raise ,</l>
       <l n="163">And , ‘ mid a grateful nation 's high applause , 160</l>
       <l n="164">Avenge his violated country 's cause !</l>
       <l n="165">Now , nearer points of spears , and many a cone</l>
       <l n="166">Of moving helmets , in the moonlight shone ,</l>
       <l n="167">As , clanking through the pass , the band of blood</l>
       <l n="168">Sprang , like hyænas , from the secret wood .</l>
       <l n="169">They rush , they seize their unresisting prey ,</l>
       <l n="170">Ruthless they tear the shrieking boy away ;</l>
       <l n="171">But , not till gashed by many a sabre wound ,</l>
       <l n="172">The father sank , expiring , on the ground .</l>
       <l n="173">He waked from the dark trance to life and pain , 170</l>
       <l n="174">But never saw his darling child again .</l>
       <l n="175">Seven snows had fallen , and seven green summers passed ,</l>
       <l n="176">Since here he heard that son 's loved accents last .</l>
       <l n="177">Still his beloved daughter soothed his cares ,</l>
       <l n="178">Whilst time began to strew with white his hairs .</l>
       <l n="179">Oft as his painted feathers he unbound ,</l>
       <l n="180">Or gazed upon his hatchet on the ground ,</l>
       <l n="181">Musing with deep despair , nor strove to speak ,</l>
       <l n="182">Light she approached , and climbed to reach his cheek ,</l>
       <l n="183">Held with both hands his forehead , then her head 180</l>
       <l n="184">Drew smiling back , and kissed the tear he shed .</l>
       <l n="185">But late , to grief and hopeless love a prey ,</l>
       <l n="186">She left his side , and wandered far away .</l>
       <l n="187">Now in this still and shelter 'd glen , that smiled</l>
       <l n="188">Beneath the crags of precipices wild ,</l>
       <l n="189">Wrapt in a stern yet sorrowful repose ,</l>
       <l n="190">The warrior half forgot his country 's woes ;</l>
       <l n="191">Forgot how many , impotent to save ,</l>
       <l n="192">Shed their best blood upon a father 's grave ;</l>
       <l n="193">How many , torn from wife and children , pine 190</l>
       <l n="194">In the dark caverns of the hopeless mine ,</l>
       <l n="195">Never to see again the blessed morn ;—</l>
       <l n="196">Slaves in the lovely land where they were born ;</l>
       <l n="197">How many at sad sunset , with a tear ,</l>
       <l n="198">The distant roar of sullen cannons hear ,</l>
       <l n="199">Whilst evening seems , as dies the sound , to throw</l>
       <l n="200">A deadlier stillness on a nation 's woe !</l>
       <l n="201">So the dark warrior , day succeeding day ,</l>
       <l n="202">Wore in distempered thought the noons away ;</l>
       <l n="203">And still , when weary evening came , he sighed , 200</l>
       <l n="204">My son , my son ! or , with emotion , cried ,</l>
       <l n="205">When I descend to the cold grave alone ,</l>
       <l n="206">Who shall be there to mourn for me ?— Not one !<span type="note_anchor">[ 202 ]</span></l>
       <l n="207">The crimson orb of day now westering flung</l>
       <l n="208">His beams , and o'er the vast Pacific hung ;</l>
       <l n="209">When from afar a shrilling sound was heard ,</l>
       <l n="210">And , hurrying o'er the dews , a scout appeared .</l>
       <l n="211">The watchful warrior knew the piercing tones ,</l>
       <l n="212">The signal-call of war , from human bones ,—</l>
       <l n="213">What tidings ? with impatient look , he cried . 210</l>
       <l n="214">Tidings of war , the hurrying scout replied ;</l>
       <l n="215">Then the sharp pipe<span type="note_anchor">[ 203 ]</span>with shriller summons blew ,</l>
       <l n="216">And held the blood-red arrow high in view .<span type="note_anchor">[ 204 ]</span></l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="4">The night was still and clear , when , o'er the snows ,</l>
       <l n="5">Andes ! thy melancholy Spirit rose ,—</l>
       <l n="6">A shadow stern and sad : he stood alone ,</l>
       <l n="7">Upon the topmost mountain 's burning cone ;</l>
       <l n="8">And whilst his eyes shone dim , through surging smoke ,</l>
       <l n="9">Thus to the spirits of the fire he spoke :—</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="10">Ye , who tread the hidden deeps ,</l>
       <l n="11">Where the silent earthquake sleeps ;</l>
       <l n="12">Ye , who track the sulphurous tide ,</l>
       <l n="13">Or on hissing vapours ride ,— 10</l>
       <l n="14">Spirits , come !</l>
       <l n="15">From worlds of subterraneous night ;</l>
       <l n="16">From fiery realms of lurid light ;</l>
       <l n="17">From the ore 's unfathomed bed ;</l>
       <l n="18">From the lava 's whirlpools red ,—</l>
       <l n="19">Spirits , come !</l>
       <l n="20">On Chili 's foes rush with vindictive sway ,</l>
       <l n="21">And sweep them from the light of living day !</l>
       <l n="22">Heard ye not the ravenous brood ,</l>
       <l n="23">That flap their wings , and scream for blood ? 20</l>
       <l n="24">On Peru 's devoted shore</l>
       <l n="25">Their murderous beaks are red with gore ;</l>
       <l n="26">Yet here , impatient for new prey ,</l>
       <l n="27">The insatiate vultures track their way .</l>
       <l n="28">Let them perish ! they , whose bands</l>
       <l n="29">Swept remote and peaceful lands !</l>
       <l n="30">Let them perish !— on their head ,</l>
       <l n="31">Descend the darkness of the dead !</l>
       <l n="32">Spirits , now your caves forsake :</l>
       <l n="33">Hark ! ten thousand warriors wake !— 30</l>
       <l n="34">Spirits , their high cause defend !—</l>
       <l n="35">From your caves ascend ! ascend !</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="36">As thus the Genius of the Andes spoke ,</l>
       <l n="37">The trembling mountain heaved with darker smoke ;</l>
       <l n="38">Lightnings , and phantom-forms , by fits appeared ;</l>
       <l n="39">His mighty voice far off Osorno heard ;</l>
       <l n="40">The caverned deeps shook through their vast profound ,</l>
       <l n="41">And Chimborazzo 's height rolled back the sound .</l>
       <l n="42">With lifted arm , and towering stature high ,</l>
       <l n="43">And aspect frowning to the middle sky 40</l>
       <l n="44">( Its misty form dilated in the wind ) ,</l>
       <l n="45">The phantom stood ,— till , less and less defined ,</l>
       <l n="46">Into thin air it faded from the sight ,</l>
       <l n="47">Lost in the ambient haze of slow-returning light .</l>
       <l n="48">Its feathery-seeming crown , its giant spear ,</l>
       <l n="49">Its limbs of huge proportion , disappear ;</l>
       <l n="50">And the bare mountains to the dawn disclose</l>
       <l n="51">The same long line of solitary snows .</l>
       <l n="52">The morning shines , the military train</l>
       <l n="53">Streams far and wide along the tented plain ; 50</l>
       <l n="54">And plaited cuirasses , and helms of steel ,</l>
       <l n="55">Throw back the sunbeams , as the horsemen wheel :</l>
       <l n="56">Thus , with arms glancing to the eastern light ,</l>
       <l n="57">Pass , in review , proud steeds and cohorts bright ;</l>
       <l n="58">For all the host , by break of morrow 's gray ,</l>
       <l n="59">Wind back their march to Penco 's northern bay ,</l>
       <l n="60">Valdivia , fearful lest confederate foes ,</l>
       <l n="61">Ambushed and dark , his progress might oppose ,</l>
       <l n="62">Marshals to-day the whole collected force ,</l>
       <l n="63">File and artillery , cuirassier and horse : 60</l>
       <l n="64">Himself yet lingers ere he joins the train ,</l>
       <l n="65">That moves , in ordered march , along the plain ,</l>
       <l n="66">While troops , and Indian slaves beneath his eye ,</l>
       <l n="67">The labours of the rising city ply :[ 208 ]</l>
       <l n="68">Wide glows the general toil ; the mole extends ,</l>
       <l n="69">The watch-tower o'er the desert surge ascends ;</l>
       <l n="70">And battlements , and rising ramparts , shine</l>
       <l n="71">Above the ocean 's blue and level line .</l>
       <l n="72">The sun ascended to meridian height ,</l>
       <l n="73">And all the northern bastions shone in light ; 70</l>
       <l n="74">With hoarse acclaim , the gong and trumpet rung ,</l>
       <l n="75">The Moorish slaves aloft their cymbals swung ,</l>
       <l n="76">When the proud victor , in triumphant state ,</l>
       <l n="77">Rode forth , in arms , through the portcullis ’ gate .</l>
       <l n="78">With neck high-arching as he smote the ground ,</l>
       <l n="79">And restless pawing to the trumpet 's sound ,—</l>
       <l n="80">With mantling mane , o'er his broad shoulders spread ,</l>
       <l n="81">And nostrils blowing , and dilated red ,—</l>
       <l n="82">The coal-black steed , in rich caparison</l>
       <l n="83">Far trailing to the ground , went proudly on . 80</l>
       <l n="84">Proudly he tramped , as conscious of his charge ,</l>
       <l n="85">And turned around his eye-balls , bright and large ,</l>
       <l n="86">And shook the frothy boss , as in disdain ;</l>
       <l n="87">And tossed the flakes , indignant , off his mane ;</l>
       <l n="88">And , with high-swelling veins , exulting pressed</l>
       <l n="89">Proudly against the barb his heaving breast .</l>
       <l n="90">The fate of empires glowing in his thought ,</l>
       <l n="91">Thus armed , the tented field Valdivia sought .</l>
       <l n="92">On the left side his poised shield he bore ,</l>
       <l n="93">With quaint devices richly blazoned o'er ; 90</l>
       <l n="94">Above the plumes , upon his helmet 's cone ,</l>
       <l n="95">Castile 's imperial crest illustrious shone ;</l>
       <l n="96">Blue in the wind the escutcheoned mantle flowed ,</l>
       <l n="97">O'er the chained mail , which tinkled as he rode .</l>
       <l n="98">The barred vizor raised , you might discern</l>
       <l n="99">His clime-changed countenance ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 209 ]</span>though pale , yet stern ,</l>
       <l n="100">And resolute as death ,— whilst in his eye</l>
       <l n="101">Sat proud Assurance , Fame , and Victory .</l>
       <l n="102">Lautaro , now in manhood 's rising pride ,</l>
       <l n="103">Rode , with a lance , attendant at his side , 100</l>
       <l n="104">In Spanish mantle gracefully arrayed ;</l>
       <l n="105">Upon his brow a tuft of feathers played :</l>
       <l n="106">His glossy locks , with dark and mantling grace ,</l>
       <l n="107">Shaded the noonday sunbeams on his face .</l>
       <l n="108">Though passed in tears the dayspring of his youth ,</l>
       <l n="109">Valdivia loved his gratitude and truth :</l>
       <l n="110">He , in Valdivia , owned a nobler friend ;</l>
       <l n="111">Kind to protect , and mighty to defend .</l>
       <l n="112">So , on he rode ; upon his youthful mien</l>
       <l n="113">A mild but sad intelligence was seen ; 110</l>
       <l n="114">Courage was on his open brow , yet care</l>
       <l n="115">Seemed like a wandering shade to linger there ;</l>
       <l n="116">And though his eye shone , as the eagle 's , bright ,</l>
       <l n="117">It beamed with humid , melancholy light</l>
       <l n="118">When now Valdivia saw the embattled line ,</l>
       <l n="119">Helmets , and swords , and shields , and matchlocks , shine ;</l>
       <l n="120">Now the long phalanx still and steady stand ,</l>
       <l n="121">Fixed every eye , and motionless each hand ;</l>
       <l n="122">Then slowly clustering , into columns wheel ,</l>
       <l n="123">Each with the red-cross banners of Castile ; 120</l>
       <l n="124">While trumps , and drums , and cymbals , to his ear</l>
       <l n="125">Made music such as soldiers love to hear ;</l>
       <l n="126">While horsemen checked their steeds , or , bending low</l>
       <l n="127">With levelled lances , o'er the saddle-bow ,</l>
       <l n="128">Rode gallantly at tilt ; and thunders broke ,</l>
       <l n="129">Instant involving van and rear in smoke ,</l>
       <l n="130">Till winds the obscuring volume rolled away ,</l>
       <l n="131">And the red file , stretched out in long array ,</l>
       <l n="132">More radiant moved beneath the beams of day ;</l>
       <l n="133">While ensigns , arms , and crosses , glittered bright ,— 130</l>
       <l n="134">Philip !<span type="note_anchor">[ 210 ]</span>he cried , seest thou the glorious sight ?</l>
       <l n="135">And dost thou deem the tribes of this poor land</l>
       <l n="136">Can men , and arms , and steeds , like these , withstand ?</l>
       <l n="137">Forgive !— the youth replied , and checked a tear ,—</l>
       <l n="138">The land where my forefathers sleep is dear !—</l>
       <l n="139">My native land !— this spot of blessed earth ,</l>
       <l n="140">The scene where I , and all I love , had birth !</l>
       <l n="141">What gratitude fidelity can give</l>
       <l n="142">Is yours , my lord !— you shielded — bade me live ,</l>
       <l n="143">When , in the circuit of the world so wide , 140</l>
       <l n="144">I had but one , one only friend beside .</l>
       <l n="145">I bowed resigned to fate ; I kissed the hand ,</l>
       <l n="146">Red with the best blood of my father 's land !<span type="note_anchor">[ 211 ]</span></l>
       <l n="147">But mighty as thou art , Valdivia , know ,</l>
       <l n="148">Though Cortes ’ desolating march laid low</l>
       <l n="149">The shrines of rich , voluptuous Mexico ;</l>
       <l n="150">With carcases , though proud Pizarro strew</l>
       <l n="151">The Sun 's imperial temple in Peru ,</l>
       <l n="152">Yet the rude dwellers of this land are brave ,</l>
       <l n="153">And the last spot they lose will be their grave ! 150</l>
       <l n="154">A moment 's crimson crossed Valdivia 's cheek —</l>
       <l n="155">Then o'er the plain he spurred , nor deigned to speak ,</l>
       <l n="156">Waving the youth , at distance , to retire ;</l>
       <l n="157">None saw the eye that shot terrific fire .</l>
       <l n="158">As their commander sternly rode along ,</l>
       <l n="159">Troop after troop , halted the martial throng ;</l>
       <l n="160">And all the pennoned trumps a louder blast</l>
       <l n="161">Blew , as the Southern World 's great victor passed .</l>
       <l n="162">Lautaro turned , scarce heeding , from the view ,</l>
       <l n="163">And from the noise of trumps and drums withdrew ; 160</l>
       <l n="164">And now , while troubled thoughts his bosom swell ,</l>
       <l n="165">Seeks the gray Missionary 's humble cell .</l>
       <l n="166">Fronting the ocean , but beyond the ken</l>
       <l n="167">Of public view , and sounds of murmuring men ,</l>
       <l n="168">Of unhewn roots composed , and gnarled wood ,</l>
       <l n="169">A small and rustic oratory stood ;</l>
       <l n="170">Upon its roof of reeds appeared a cross ,</l>
       <l n="171">The porch within was lined with mantling moss ;</l>
       <l n="172">A crucifix and hour-glass , on each side —</l>
       <l n="173">One to admonish seemed , and one to guide ; 170</l>
       <l n="174">This , to impress how soon life 's race is o'er ;</l>
       <l n="175">And that , to lift our hopes where time shall be no more .</l>
       <l n="176">O'er the rude porch , with wild and gadding stray ,</l>
       <l n="177">The clustering copu weaved its trellis gay ;</l>
       <l n="178">Two mossy pines , high bending , interwove</l>
       <l n="179">Their aged and fantastic arms above .</l>
       <l n="180">In front , amid the gay surrounding flowers ,</l>
       <l n="181">A dial counted the departing hours ,</l>
       <l n="182">On which the sweetest light of summer shone ,—</l>
       <l n="183">A rude and brief inscription marked the stone : 180</l>
       <l n="184">To count , with passing shade , the hours ,</l>
       <l n="185">I placed the dial ‘ mid the flowers ;</l>
       <l n="186">That , one by one , came forth , and died ,</l>
       <l n="187">Blooming , and withering , round its side .</l>
       <l n="188">Mortal , let the sight impart</l>
       <l n="189">Its pensive moral to thy heart !</l>
       <l n="190">Just heard to trickle through a covert near ,</l>
       <l n="191">And soothing , with perpetual lapse , the ear ,</l>
       <l n="192">A fount , like rain-drops , filtered through the stone ,</l>
       <l n="193">And , bright as amber , on the shallows shone . 190</l>
       <l n="194">Intent his fairy pastime to pursue ,</l>
       <l n="195">And , gem-like , hovering o'er the violets blue ,</l>
       <l n="196">The humming-bird , here , its unceasing song</l>
       <l n="197">Heedlessly murmured , all the summer long ;</l>
       <l n="198">And when the winter came , retired to rest ,</l>
       <l n="199">And from the myrtles hung its trembling nest .</l>
       <l n="200">No sounds of a conflicting world were near ;</l>
       <l n="201">The noise of ocean faintly met the ear ,</l>
       <l n="202">That seemed , as sunk to rest the noontide blast ,</l>
       <l n="203">But dying sounds of passions that were past ; 200</l>
       <l n="204">Or closing anthems , when , far off , expire</l>
       <l n="205">The lessening echoes of the distant choir .</l>
       <l n="206">Here , every human sorrow hushed to rest ,</l>
       <l n="207">His pale hands meekly crossed upon his breast ,</l>
       <l n="208">Anselmo sat : the sun , with westering ray ,</l>
       <l n="209">Just touched his temples , and his locks of gray .</l>
       <l n="210">There was no worldly feeling in his eye ;</l>
       <l n="211">The world to him was “ as a thing gone by . ”</l>
       <l n="212">Now , all his features lit , he raised his look ,</l>
       <l n="213">Then bent it thoughtful , and unclasped the book ; 210</l>
       <l n="214">And whilst the hour-glass shed its silent sand ,</l>
       <l n="215">A tame opossum<span type="note_anchor">[ 212 ]</span>licked his withered hand .</l>
       <l n="216">That sweetest light of slow-declining day ,</l>
       <l n="217">Which through the trellis poured its slanting ray ,</l>
       <l n="218">Resting a moment on his few gray hairs ,</l>
       <l n="219">Seemed light from heaven sent down to bless his prayers .</l>
       <l n="220">When the trump echoed to the quiet spot ,</l>
       <l n="221">He thought upon the world , but mourned it not ;</l>
       <l n="222">Enough if his meek wisdom could control ,</l>
       <l n="223">And bend to mercy , one proud soldier 's soul ; 220</l>
       <l n="224">Enough , if , while these distant scenes he trod ,</l>
       <l n="225">He led one erring Indian to his God .</l>
       <l n="226">Whence comes my son ? with kind complacent look</l>
       <l n="227">He asked , and closed again the embossed book .</l>
       <l n="228">I come to thee for peace , the youth replied :</l>
       <l n="229">Oh , there is strife , and cruelty , and pride ,</l>
       <l n="230">In this sad Christian world ! My native land</l>
       <l n="231">Was happy , ere the soldier , with his band</l>
       <l n="232">Of fell destroyers , like a vulture , came ,</l>
       <l n="233">And gave its peaceful scenes to blood and flame . 230</l>
       <l n="234">When will the turmoil of earth 's tempests cease ?</l>
       <l n="235">Father , I come to thee for peace — for peace !</l>
       <l n="236">Seek peace , the father cried , with God above :</l>
       <l n="237">In His good time , all will be peace and love .</l>
       <l n="238">We mourn , indeed , mourn that all sounds of ill ,</l>
       <l n="239">Earth 's fairest scenes with one deep murmur fill ;</l>
       <l n="240">That yonder sun , when evening paints the sky ,</l>
       <l n="241">Sinks , beauteous , on a world of misery ;</l>
       <l n="242">The course of wide destruction to withstand ,</l>
       <l n="243">We lift our feeble voice — our trembling hand ; 240</l>
       <l n="244">But still , bowed low , or smitten to the dust ,</l>
       <l n="245">Father of mercy , still in Thee we trust !</l>
       <l n="246">Through good or ill , in poverty or wealth ,</l>
       <l n="247">In joy or woe , in sickness or in health ,</l>
       <l n="248">Meek Piety thy awful hand surveys ,</l>
       <l n="249">And the faint murmur turns to prayer and praise !</l>
       <l n="250">We know — whatever evils we deplore —</l>

       <l n="4">Come ,— for the sun yet hangs above the bay ,—</l>
       <l n="5">And whilst our time may brook a brief delay</l>
       <l n="6">With other thoughts , and , haply with a tear ,</l>
       <l n="7">An old man 's tale of sorrow thou shalt hear .</l>
       <l n="8">I wished not to reveal it ;— thoughts that dwell</l>
       <l n="9">Deep in the lonely bosom 's inmost cell</l>
       <l n="10">Unnoticed , and unknown , too painful wake ,</l>
       <l n="11">And , like a tempest , the dark spirit shake ,</l>
       <l n="12">When , starting from our slumberous apathy ,</l>
       <l n="13">We gaze upon the scenes of days gone by . 10</l>
       <l n="14">Yet , if a moment 's irritating flush ,</l>
       <l n="15">Darkens thy cheek ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 214 ]</span>as thoughts conflicting rush ,</l>
       <l n="16">When I disclose my hidden griefs , the tale</l>
       <l n="17">May more than wisdom or reproof prevail .</l>
       <l n="18">Oh , may it teach thee , till all trials cease ,</l>
       <l n="19">To hold thy course , though sorrowing , yet in peace ;</l>
       <l n="20">Still looking up to Him , the soul 's best stay ,</l>
       <l n="21">Who Faith and Hope shall crown , when worlds are swept away !</l>
       <l n="22">Where fair Seville 's Morisco<span type="note_anchor">[ 215 ]</span>turrets gleam</l>
       <l n="23">On Guadilquiver 's gently-stealing stream ; 20</l>
       <l n="24">Whose silent waters , seaward as they glide ,</l>
       <l n="25">Reflect the wild-rose thickets on its side ,</l>
       <l n="26">My youth was passed . Oh , days for ever gone !</l>
       <l n="27">How touched with Heaven 's own light your mornings shone</l>
       <l n="28">Even now , when lonely and forlorn I bend ,</l>
       <l n="29">My weary journey hastening to its end ,</l>
       <l n="30">A drooping exile on a distant shore ,</l>
       <l n="31">I mourn the hours of youth that are no more .</l>
       <l n="32">The tender thought amid my prayers has part ,</l>
       <l n="33">And steals , at times , from Heaven my aged heart . 30</l>
       <l n="34">Forgive the cause , O God !— forgive the tear ,</l>
       <l n="35">That flows , even now , o'er Leonora 's bier ;</l>
       <l n="36">For , ‘ midst the innocent and lovely , none</l>
       <l n="37">More beautiful than Leonora shone .</l>
       <l n="38">As by her widowed mother 's side she knelt ,</l>
       <l n="39">A sad and sacred sympathy I felt .</l>
       <l n="40">At Easter-tide , when the high mass was sung ,</l>
       <l n="41">And , fuming high , the silver censer swung ;</l>
       <l n="42">When rich-hued windows , from the arches ’ height ,</l>
       <l n="43">Poured o'er the shrines a soft and yellow light ; 40</l>
       <l n="44">From aisle to aisle , amid the service clear ,</l>
       <l n="45">When “ Adoremus ” swelled upon the ear .</l>
       <l n="46">( Such as to Heaven thy rapt attention drew</l>
       <l n="47">First in the Christian churches of Peru ) ,</l>
       <l n="48">She seemed , methought , some spirit of the sky ,</l>
       <l n="49">Descending to that holy harmony .</l>
       <l n="50">But wherefore tell , when life and hope were new ,</l>
       <l n="51">How by degrees the soul 's first passion grew !</l>
       <l n="52">I loved her , and I won her virgin heart ;</l>
       <l n="53">But fortune whispered , we a while must part . 50</l>
       <l n="54">The minster tolled the middle hour of night ,</l>
       <l n="55">When , waked to agony and wild affright ,</l>
       <l n="56">I heard those words , words of appalling dread —</l>
       <l n="57">“ The Holy Inquisition ! ” — from the bed</l>
       <l n="58">I started ; snatched my dagger , and my cloak —</l>
       <l n="59">Who dare accuse me !— none , in answer , spoke .</l>
       <l n="60">The demons seized , in silence , on their prey ,</l>
       <l n="61">And tore me from my dreams of bliss away .</l>
       <l n="62">How frightful was their silence , and their shade ,</l>
       <l n="63">In torch-light , as their victim they conveyed , 60</l>
       <l n="64">By dark-inscribed , and massy-windowed walls ,</l>
       <l n="65">Through the dim twilight of terrific halls ;</l>
       <l n="66">( For thou hast heard me speak of that foul stain</l>
       <l n="67">Of pure religion , and the rights of Spain ;)</l>
       <l n="68">Whilst the high windows shook to night 's cold blast ,</l>
       <l n="69">And echoed to the foot-fall as we passed !</l>
       <l n="70">They left me , faint and breathless with affright ,</l>
       <l n="71">In a cold cell , to solitude and night ;</l>
       <l n="72">Oh ! think , what horror through the heart must thrill</l>
       <l n="73">When the last bolt was barred , and all at once was still ! 70</l>
       <l n="74">Nor day nor night was here , but a deep gloom ,</l>
       <l n="75">Sadder than darkness , wrapped the living tomb .</l>
       <l n="76">Some bread and water , nature to sustain ,</l>
       <l n="77">Duly was brought when eve returned again ;</l>
       <l n="78">And thus I knew , hoping it were the last ,</l>
       <l n="79">Another day of lingering life was passed .</l>
       <l n="80">Five years immured in that deep den of night ,</l>
       <l n="81">I never saw the sweet sun 's blessed light .</l>
       <l n="82">Once as the grate , with sullen sound , was barred ,</l>
       <l n="83">And to the bolts the inmost cavern jarred , 80</l>
       <l n="84">Methought I heard , as clanged the iron door ,</l>
       <l n="85">A dull and hollow echo from the floor ;</l>
       <l n="86">I stamped ; the vault , and winding caves around ,</l>
       <l n="87">Returned a long and melancholy sound .</l>
       <l n="88">With patient toil I raised a massy stone ,</l>
       <l n="89">And looked into a depth of shade unknown ;</l>
       <l n="90">The murky twilight of the lurid place</l>
       <l n="91">Helped me , at length , a secret way to trace :</l>
       <l n="92">I entered ; step by step explored the road ,</l>
       <l n="93">In darkness , from my desolate abode ; 90</l>
       <l n="94">Till , winding through long passages of night ,</l>
       <l n="95">I saw , at distance , a dim streak of light :—</l>
       <l n="96">It was the sun — the bright , the blessed beam</l>
       <l n="97">Of day ! I knelt — I wept ;— the glittering stream</l>
       <l n="98">Rolled on beneath me , as I left the cave ,</l>
       <l n="99">Concealed in woods above the winding wave .</l>
       <l n="100">I rested on a verdant bank a while ,</l>
       <l n="101">I saw around the summer landscape smile ;</l>
       <l n="102">I gained a peasant 's hut ; nor dared to leave ,</l>
       <l n="103">Till , with slow step , advanced the glimmering eve . 100</l>
       <l n="104">Remembering still affection 's fondest hours ,</l>
       <l n="105">I turned my footsteps to the city towers ;</l>
       <l n="106">In pilgrim 's dress , I traced the streets unknown :</l>
       <l n="107">No light in Leonora 's lattice shone .</l>
       <l n="108">The morning came ; the busy tumult swells ;</l>
       <l n="109">Knolling to church , I heard the minster bells ;</l>
       <l n="110">Involuntary to that scene I strayed ,</l>
       <l n="111">Disguised , where first I saw my faithful maid .</l>
       <l n="112">I saw her , pallid , at the altar stand ,</l>
       <l n="113">And yield , half-shrinking , her reluctant hand ; 110</l>
       <l n="114">She turned her head ; she saw my hollow eyes ,</l>
       <l n="115">And knew me , wasted , wan , in my disguise ;</l>
       <l n="116">She shrieked , and fell ;— breathless , I left the fane</l>
       <l n="117">In agony — nor saw her form again ;</l>
       <l n="118">And from that day her voice , her look were given ,</l>
       <l n="119">Her name , her memory , to the winds of heaven .</l>
       <l n="120">Far off I bent my melancholy way ,</l>
       <l n="121">Heart-sick and faint , and , in this gown of gray ,</l>
       <l n="122">From every human eye my sorrows hid ,</l>
       <l n="123">Unknown , amidst the tumult of Madrid . 120</l>
       <l n="124">Grief in my heart , despair upon my look ,</l>
       <l n="125">With no companion save my beads and book ,</l>
       <l n="126">My morsel with Affliction 's sons to share ,</l>
       <l n="127">To tend the sick and poor , my only care ,</l>
       <l n="128">Forgotten , thus I lived ; till day by day</l>
       <l n="129">Had worn nigh thirteen years of grief away .</l>
       <l n="130">One winter 's night , when I had closed my cell ,</l>
       <l n="131">And bid the labours of the day farewell ,</l>
       <l n="132">An aged crone approached , with panting breath ,</l>
       <l n="133">And bade me hasten to the house of death . 130</l>
       <l n="134">I came . With moving lips intent to pray ,</l>
       <l n="135">A dying woman on a pallet lay ;</l>
       <l n="136">Her lifted hands were wasted to the bone ,</l>
       <l n="137">And ghastly on her look the lamp-light shone ;</l>
       <l n="138">Beside the bed a pious daughter stands</l>
       <l n="139">Silent , and , weeping , kisses her pale hands .</l>
       <l n="140">Feebly she spoke , and raised her languid head ,</l>
       <l n="141">Forgive , forgive !— they told me he was dead !—</l>
       <l n="142">But in the sunshine of that dreadful day ,</l>
       <l n="143">That gave me to another 's arms away , 140</l>
       <l n="144">I saw him , like a ghost , with deadly stare ;</l>
       <l n="145">I saw his wasted eye-balls ’ ghastly glare ;</l>
       <l n="146">I saw his lips ( oh , hide them , God of love ! )</l>
       <l n="147">I saw his livid lips , half-muttering , move ,</l>
       <l n="148">To curse the maid — forgetful of her vow :—</l>
       <l n="149">Perhaps he lives to curse — to curse me now !</l>
       <l n="150">He lives to bless ! I cried ; and , drawing nigh ,</l>
       <l n="151">Held up the crucifix ; her heavy eye</l>
       <l n="152">She raised , and scarce pronounced — Does he yet live ?</l>
       <l n="153">Can he his lost , his dying child forgive ? 150</l>
       <l n="154">Will God forgive — the Lord who bled — will He ?—</l>
       <l n="155">Ah , no , there is no mercy left for me !</l>
       <l n="156">Words were but vain , and colours all too faint ,</l>
       <l n="157">That awful moment of despair to paint .</l>
       <l n="158">She knew me ; her exhausted breath , with pain ,</l>
       <l n="159">Drawing , she pressed my hand , and spoke again :</l>
       <l n="160">By a false guardian 's cruel wiles deceived ,</l>
       <l n="161">The tale of fraudful falsehood I believed ,</l>
       <l n="162">And thought thee dead ; he gave the stern command ,</l>
       <l n="163">And bade me take the rich Antonio 's hand . 160</l>
       <l n="164">I knelt , implored , embraced my guardian 's knees ;</l>
       <l n="165">Ruthless inquisitor , he held the keys</l>
       <l n="166">Of the dark torture-house .<span type="note_anchor">[ 216 ]</span>Trembling for life ,</l>
       <l n="167">Yes , I became a sad , heart-broken wife !</l>
       <l n="168">Yet curse me not ; of every human care</l>
       <l n="169">Already my full heart has had its share :</l>
       <l n="170">Abandoned , left in youth to want and woe ,</l>
       <l n="171">Oh ! let these tears , that agonising flow ,</l>
       <l n="172">Witness how deep ev'n now my heart is rent !</l>
       <l n="173">Yet one is lovely — one is innocent ! 170</l>
       <l n="174">Protect , protect , ( and faint in death she smiled )</l>
       <l n="175">When I am dead , protect my orphan child !</l>
       <l n="176">The dreadful prison , that so long detained</l>
       <l n="177">My wasting life , her dying words explained .</l>
       <l n="178">The wretched priest , who wounded me by stealth ,</l>
       <l n="179">Bartered her love , her innocence for wealth !</l>
       <l n="180">I laid her bones in earth ; the chanted hymn</l>
       <l n="181">Echoed along the hollow cloister dim ;</l>
       <l n="182">I heard , far off , the bell funereal toll ,</l>
       <l n="183">And sorrowing said : Now peace be with her soul ! 180</l>
       <l n="184">Far o'er the Western Ocean I conveyed ,</l>
       <l n="185">And Indiana called the orphan maid ;</l>
       <l n="186">Beneath my eye she grew , and , day by day ,</l>
       <l n="187">Seemed , grateful , every kindness to repay .</l>
       <l n="188">Renouncing Spain , her cruelties and crimes ,</l>
       <l n="189">Amid untutored tribes , in distant climes ,</l>
       <l n="190">‘ Twas mine to spread the light of truth , or save</l>
       <l n="191">From stripes and torture the poor Indian slave .</l>
       <l n="192">I saw thee , young and innocent , alone ,</l>
       <l n="193">Cast on the mercies of a race unknown ; 190</l>
       <l n="194">I saw , in dark adversity 's cold hour ,</l>
       <l n="195">Thy virtues blooming , like a winter 's flower ;</l>
       <l n="196">From chains and slavery I redeemed thy youth ,</l>
       <l n="197">Poured on thy mental sight the beams of truth ;</l>
       <l n="198">By thy warm heart and mild demeanour won ,</l>
       <l n="199">Called thee my other child — my age 's son .</l>
       <l n="200">I need not tell the sequel ;— not unmoved</l>
       <l n="201">Poor Indiana heard thy tale , and loved ;</l>
       <l n="202">Some sympathy a kindred fate might claim ;</l>
       <l n="203">Your years , your fortunes , and your friend the same ;</l>
       <l n="204">Both early of a parent 's care bereft , 201</l>
       <l n="205">Both strangers in a world of sadness left ;</l>
       <l n="206">I marked each slowly-struggling thought ; I shed</l>
       <l n="207">A tear of love paternal on each head ;</l>
       <l n="208">And , while I saw her timid eyes incline ,</l>
       <l n="209">Blessed the affection that had made her thine !</l>
       <l n="210">Here let the murmurs of despondence cease :</l>
       <l n="211">There is a God — believe — and part in peace !</l>
       <l n="212">Rich hues illumed the track of dying day</l>
       <l n="213">As the great sun sank in the western bay , 210</l>
       <l n="214">And only its last light yet lingering shone ,</l>
       <l n="215">Upon the highest palm-tree 's feathery cone ;</l>
       <l n="216">When at a distance on the dewy plain ,</l>
       <l n="217">In mingled group appeared an Indian train ;</l>
       <l n="218">Men , women , children , round Anselmo press ,</l>
       <l n="219">Farewell ! they cried . He raised his hand to bless ,</l>
       <l n="220">And said : My children , may the God above</l>
       <l n="221">Still lead you in the paths of peace and love ;</l>
       <l n="222">To-morrow , we must part ;— when I am gone ,</l>
       <l n="223">Raise on this spot a cross , and place a stone , 220</l>
       <l n="224">That tribes unborn may some memorial have ,</l>
       <l n="225">When I far off am mouldering in the grave ,</l>
       <l n="226">Of that poor messenger , who tidings bore</l>
       <l n="227">Of Gospel-mercy to your distant shore .</l>
       <l n="228">The crowd retired ; along the twilight gray ,</l>
       <l n="229">The condor kept its solitary way ,</l>
       <l n="230">The fire-flies shone , when to the hermit 's cell</l>
       <l n="231">Who hastens but the minstrel Zarinel !</l>
       <l n="232">In foreign lands , far from his native home ,</l>
       <l n="233">‘ Twas his , a gay , romantic youth , to roam , 230</l>
       <l n="234">With a light cittern o'er his shoulders slung ,</l>
       <l n="235">Where'er he passed he played , and loved , and sung ;</l>
       <l n="236">And thus accomplished , late had joined the train</l>
       <l n="237">Of gallant soldiers on the southern plain .</l>
       <l n="238">Father , he cried , uncertain of the fate</l>
       <l n="239">That may to-morrow 's toilsome march await ,</l>
       <l n="240">For long will be the road , I would confess</l>
       <l n="241">Some secret thoughts that on my bosom press .</l>
       <l n="242">They are of one I left , an Indian maid ,</l>
       <l n="243">Whose trusting love my careless heart betrayed . 240</l>
       <l n="244">Say , may I speak ?</l>
       <l n="245">Say on , the father cried ,</l>
       <l n="246">Nor be to penitence all hope denied .</l>
       <l n="247">Then hear , Anselmo ! From a very child</l>
       <l n="248">I loved all fancies marvellous and wild ;</l>
       <l n="249">I turned from truth , to listen to the lore</l>
       <l n="250">Of many an old and fabling troubadour .</l>
       <l n="251">Thus , with impassioned heart , and wayward mind ,</l>
       <l n="252">To dreams and shapes of shadowy things resigned ,</l>
       <l n="253">I left my native vales and village home , 250</l>
       <l n="254">Wide o'er the world a minstrel boy to roam .</l>
       <l n="255">I never shall forget the day , the hour ,</l>
       <l n="256">When , all my soul resigned to Fancy 's power ,</l>
       <l n="257">First , from the snowy Pyrenees , I cast</l>
       <l n="258">My labouring vision o'er the landscape vast ,</l>
       <l n="259">And saw beneath my feet long vapours float ,</l>
       <l n="260">Streams , mountains , woods , and ocean 's mist remote .</l>
       <l n="261">There once I met a soldier , poor and old ,</l>
       <l n="262">Who tales of Cortes and Bilboa told ,</l>
       <l n="263">And this new world ; he spoke of Indian maids , 260</l>
       <l n="264">Rivers like seas , and forests whose deep shades</l>
       <l n="265">Had never yet been pierced by morning ray ,</l>
       <l n="266">And how the green bird mocked , and talked all day .</l>
       <l n="267">Imagination thus , in colours new ,</l>
       <l n="268">This distant world presented to my view ;</l>
       <l n="269">Young , and enchanted with the fancied scene ,</l>
       <l n="270">I crossed the toiling seas that roared between ,</l>
       <l n="271">And with ideal images impressed ,</l>
       <l n="272">Stood on these unknown shores a wondering guest .</l>
       <l n="273">Still to romantic phantasies resigned , 270</l>
       <l n="274">I left Callao 's crowded port behind ,</l>
       <l n="275">And climbed the mountains which their shadow threw</l>
       <l n="276">Upon the lessening summits of Peru .</l>
       <l n="277">Some sheep the armed peasants drove before ,</l>
       <l n="278">That all our food through the wild passes bore ,</l>
       <l n="279">Had wandered in the frost-smoke of the morn ,</l>
       <l n="280">Far from the track ; I blew the signal horn —</l>
       <l n="281">But echo only answered : ‘ mid the snows ,</l>
       <l n="282">Wildered and lost , I saw the evening close .</l>
       <l n="283">The sun was setting in the crimson west ; 280</l>
       <l n="284">In all the earth I had no home of rest ;</l>
       <l n="285">The last sad light upon the ice-hills shone ;</l>
       <l n="286">I seemed forsaken in a world unknown ;</l>
       <l n="287">How did my cold and sinking heart rejoice ,</l>
       <l n="288">When , hark ! methought I heard a human voice !</l>
       <l n="289">It might be some wild Indian 's roving troop ,</l>
       <l n="290">Or the dread echo of their distant whoop ;</l>
       <l n="291">Still it was human , and I seemed to find</l>
       <l n="292">Again some commerce with remote mankind .</l>
       <l n="293">The voice comes nearer , rising through the shade — 290</l>
       <l n="294">Is it the song of some rude mountain-maid ?</l>
       <l n="295">And now I heard the tread of hastening feet ,</l>
       <l n="296">And , in the western glen , a Llama bleat .</l>
       <l n="297">I listened — all is still ; but hark ! again</l>
       <l n="298">Near and more near is heard the welcome strain ;</l>
       <l n="299">It is a wild maid 's carolling , who seeks</l>
       <l n="300">Her wandering Llama ‘ midst the snowy peaks :</l>
       <l n="301">Truant , she cried , thy lurking place is found !</l>
       <l n="302">With languid touch I waked the cittern 's sound ,</l>
       <l n="303">And soon a maid , by the pale light , I saw 300</l>
       <l n="304">Gaze breathless with astonishment and awe :</l>
       <l n="305">What instant terrors to her fancy rose ,</l>
       <l n="306">Ha ! is it not the Spirit of the snows !</l>
       <l n="307">But when she saw me , weary , cold , and weak ,</l>
       <l n="308">Stretch forth my hand ( for now I could not speak ) ,</l>
       <l n="309">She pitied , raised me from the snows , and led</l>
       <l n="310">My faltering footsteps to her father 's shed ;</l>
       <l n="311">The Llama followed with her tinkling bell ;</l>
       <l n="312">The dwelling rose within a craggy dell ,</l>
       <l n="313">O'erhung with icy summits . To be brief , 310</l>
       <l n="314">She was the daughter of an aged chief ;</l>
       <l n="315">He , by her gentle voice to pity won ,</l>
       <l n="316">Showed mercy , for himself had lost a son .</l>
       <l n="317">The father spoke not ; by the pine-wood blaze ,</l>
       <l n="318">The daughter stood , and turned a cake of maize ;</l>
       <l n="319">And then , as sudden shone the light , I saw</l>
       <l n="320">Such features as no artist hand might draw .</l>
       <l n="321">Her form , her face , her symmetry , her air ,</l>
       <l n="322">Father ! thy age must such recital spare :—</l>
       <l n="323">She saved my life ; and kindness , if not love , 320</l>
       <l n="324">Might sure in time the coldest bosom move !</l>
       <l n="325">Mine was not cold ; she loved to hear me sing ,</l>
       <l n="326">And sometimes touched with playful hand the string ;</l>
       <l n="327">And when I waked some melancholy strain ,</l>
       <l n="328">She wept , and smiled , and bade me sing again .</l>
       <l n="329">So many a happy day , in this deep glen ,</l>
       <l n="330">Far from the noise of life , and sounds of men ,</l>
       <l n="331">Was passed ! Nay , father , the sad sequel hear :</l>
       <l n="332">‘ Twas now the leafy spring-time of the year —</l>
       <l n="333">Ambition called me : true , I knew to part 330</l>
       <l n="334">Would break her generous , warm , and trusting heart ;</l>
       <l n="335">True , I had vowed , but now estranged and cold ,</l>
       <l n="336">She saw my look , and shuddered to behold :—</l>
       <l n="337">She would go with me , leave the lonely glade</l>
       <l n="338">Where she grew up , but my stern voice forbade ;</l>
       <l n="339">She hid her face and wept : Go then away ,</l>
       <l n="340">( Father , methinks , ev'n now , I hear her say )</l>
       <l n="341">Go to thy distant land , forget this tear ,</l>
       <l n="342">Forget these rocks , forget I once was dear ;</l>
       <l n="343">Fly to the world , o'er the wide ocean fly , 340</l>
       <l n="344">And leave me unremembered here to die !</l>
       <l n="345">Yet to my father should I all relate ,</l>
       <l n="346">Death , instant death , would be a traitor 's fate !</l>
       <l n="347">Nor fear , nor pity moved my stubborn mind ,</l>
       <l n="348">I left her sorrows and the scene behind ;</l>
       <l n="349">I sought Valdivia on the southern plain ,</l>
       <l n="350">And joined the careless military train ;</l>
       <l n="351">Oh ! ere I sleep , thus , lowly on my knee ,</l>
       <l n="352">Father , I absolution crave from thee !</l>
       <l n="353">Anselmo spoke , with look and voice severe : 350</l>
       <l n="354">Yes , thoughtless youth , my absolution hear .</l>
       <l n="355">First , by deep penitence the wrong atone ,</l>
       <l n="356">Then absolution ask from God alone !</l>
       <l n="357">Yet stay , and to my warning voice attend ,</l>
       <l n="358">And hear me as a father , and a friend .</l>
       <l n="359">Let Truth severe be wayward Fancy 's guide ,</l>
       <l n="360">Let stern-eyed Conscience o'er each thought preside ;</l>
       <l n="361">The passions , that on noblest natures prey ,</l>
       <l n="362">Oh ! cast them , like corroding bonds , away !</l>
       <l n="363">Disdain to act mean falsehood 's coward part , 360</l>
       <l n="364">And let religion dignify thine art .</l>
       <l n="365">If , by thy bed , thou seest at midnight stand</l>
       <l n="366">Pale Conscience , pointing , with terrific hand ,</l>
       <l n="367">To deeds of darkness done , whilst , like a corse ,</l>
       <l n="368">To shake thy soul , uprises dire Remorse ;</l>
       <l n="369">Fly to God 's mercy , fly , ere yet too late —</l>
       <l n="370">Perhaps one hour marks thy eternal fate ;</l>
       <l n="371">Let the warm tear of deep contrition flow ,</l>
       <l n="372">The heart obdurate melt , like softening snow ,</l>
       <l n="373">The last vain follies of thy youth deplore , 370</l>
       <l n="374">Then go , in secret weep , and sin no more !</l>
       <l n="375">The stars innumerous in their watches shone —</l>
       <l n="376">Anselmo knelt before the cross alone .</l>
       <l n="377">Ten thousand glowing orbs their pomp displayed ,</l>
       <l n="378">Whilst , looking up , thus silently he prayed :—</l>
       <l n="379">Oh ! how oppressive to the aching sense ,</l>
       <l n="380">How fearful were this vast magnificence ,</l>
       <l n="381">This prodigality of glory , spread</l>
       <l n="382">Above a poor and dying emmet 's head ,</l>
       <l n="383">That toiled his transient hour upon the shore 380</l>
       <l n="384">Of mortal life , and then was seen no more ;</l>
       <l n="385">If man beheld , on his terrific throne ,</l>
       <l n="386">A dark , cold , distant Deity , alone !</l>
       <l n="387">Felt no relating , no endearing tie ,</l>
       <l n="388">That Hope might upwards raise her glistening eye ,</l>
       <l n="389">And think , with deep unutterable bliss ,</l>
       <l n="390">In yonder radiant realm my kingdom is !</l>
       <l n="391">More glorious than those orbs that silent roll ,</l>
       <l n="392">Shines Heaven 's redeeming mercy on the soul —</l>
       <l n="393">Oh , pure effulgence of unbounded love ! 390</l>
       <l n="394">In Thee , I think — I feel — I live — I move ;</l>
       <l n="395">Yet when , O Thou , whose name is Love and Light ,</l>
       <l n="396">When will thy Dayspring on these realms of night</l>
       <l n="397">Arise ! Oh ! when shall severed nations raise</l>
       <l n="398">One hallelujah of triumphant praise ,</l>
       <l n="399">Tibet on Fars , Andes on Atlas call ,</l>
       <l n="400">And “ roll the loud hosannah ” round the ball !</l>
       <l n="401">Soon may Thy kingdom come , that love , and peace ,</l>
       <l n="402">And charity , may bid earth 's chidings cease !</l>
       <l n="403">Meantime , in life or death , through good or ill , 400</l>
       <l n="404">Thy poor and feeble servant , I fulfil ,</l>
       <l n="405">As best I may , Thy high and holy will ,</l>
       <l n="406">Till , weary , on the world my eyelids close ,</l>
       <l n="407">And I enjoy my long and last repose !</l>

       <l n="1">Assembly of Indian warriors — Caupolican , Ongolmo , Teucapel ,</l>
       <l n="2">Mountain-chief — Song of the Indian Wizard — White woman and child .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">Far in the centre of the deepest wood ,</l>
       <l n="4">The assembled fathers of their country stood .</l>
       <l n="5">‘ Twas midnight now ; the pine-wood fire burned red ,</l>
       <l n="6">And to the leaves a shadowy glimmer spread ;</l>
       <l n="7">The struggling smoke , or flame with fitful glance ,</l>
       <l n="8">Obscured , or showed , some dreadful countenance ;</l>
       <l n="9">And every warrior , as his club he reared ,</l>
       <l n="10">With larger shadow , indistinct , appeared ;</l>
       <l n="11">While more terrific , his wild locks and mien ,</l>
       <l n="12">And fierce eye , through the quivering smoke , was seen . 10</l>
       <l n="13">In sea-wolf 's skin , here Mariantu stood ;</l>
       <l n="14">Gnashed his white teeth , impatient , and cried , blood !</l>
       <l n="15">His lofty brow , with crimson feathers bound ,</l>
       <l n="16">Here , brooding death , the huge Ongolmo frowned ;</l>
       <l n="17">And , like a giant of no earthly race ,</l>
       <l n="18">To his broad shoulders heaved his ponderous mace .</l>
       <l n="19">With lifted hatchet , as in act to fell ,</l>
       <l n="20">Here stood the young and ardent Teucapel .</l>
       <l n="21">Like a lone cypress , stately in decay ,</l>
       <l n="22">When time has worn its summer boughs away , 20</l>
       <l n="23">And hung its trunk with moss and lichens sere ,</l>
       <l n="24">The Mountain-warrior rested on his spear .</l>
       <l n="25">And thus , and at this hour , a hundred chiefs ,</l>
       <l n="26">Chosen avengers of their country 's griefs ;</l>
       <l n="27">Chiefs of the scattered tribes that roam the plain ,</l>
       <l n="28">That sweeps from Andes to the western main ,</l>
       <l n="29">Their country-gods , around the coiling smoke ,</l>
       <l n="30">With sacrifice , and silent prayers , invoke .</l>
       <l n="31">For all , at first , were silent as the dead ;</l>
       <l n="32">The pine was heard to whisper o'er their head , 30</l>
       <l n="33">So stood the stern assembly ; but apart ,</l>
       <l n="34">Wrapped in the spirit of his fearful art ,</l>
       <l n="35">Alone , to hollow sounds of hideous hum ,</l>
       <l n="36">The wizard-seer struck his prophetic drum .</l>
       <l n="37">Silent they stood , and watched with anxious eyes ,</l>
       <l n="38">What phantom-shape might from the ground arise ;</l>
       <l n="39">No voices came , no spectre-form appeared ;</l>
       <l n="40">A hollow sound , but not of winds , was heard</l>
       <l n="41">Among the leaves , and distant thunder low ,</l>
       <l n="42">Which seemed like moans of an expiring foe . 40</l>
       <l n="43">His crimson feathers quivering in the smoke ,</l>
       <l n="44">Then , with loud voice , first Mariantu spoke :</l>
       <l n="45">Hail we the omen ! Spirits of the slain ,</l>
       <l n="46">I hear your voices ! Mourn , devoted Spain !</l>
       <l n="47">Pale-visaged tyrants ! still , along our coasts ,</l>
       <l n="48">Shall we despairing mark your iron hosts !</l>
       <l n="49">Spirits of our brave fathers , curse the race</l>
       <l n="50">Who thus your name , your memory disgrace !</l>
       <l n="51">No ; though yon mountain 's everlasting snows</l>
       <l n="52">In vain Almagro 's<span type="note_anchor">[ 217 ]</span>toilsome march oppose ; 50</l>
       <l n="53">Though Atacama 's long and wasteful plain</l>
       <l n="54">Be heaped with blackening carcases in vain ;</l>
       <l n="55">Though still fresh hosts those snowy summits scale ,</l>
       <l n="56">And scare the Llamas with their glittering mail ;</l>
       <l n="57">Though sullen castles lour along our shore ;</l>
       <l n="58">Though our polluted soil be drenched with gore ;</l>
       <l n="59">Insolent tyrants ! we , prepared to die ,</l>
       <l n="60">Your arms , your horses , and your gods , defy !</l>
       <l n="61">He spoke : the warriors stamped upon the ground ,</l>
       <l n="62">And tore the feathers that their foreheads bound . 60</l>
       <l n="63">Insolent tyrants ! burst the general cry ,</l>
       <l n="64">We , met for vengeance — we , prepared to die ,</l>
       <l n="65">Your arms , your horses , and your gods , defy !</l>
       <l n="66">Then Teucapel , with warm emotion , cried :</l>
       <l n="67">This hatchet never yet in blood was dyed ;</l>
       <l n="68">May it be buried deep within my heart ,</l>
       <l n="69">If living from the conflict I depart ,</l>
       <l n="70">Till loud , from shore to shore , is heard one cry ,</l>
       <l n="71">See ! in their gore where the last tyrants lie !</l>
       <l n="72">The Mountain-warrior : Oh , that I could raise 70</l>
       <l n="73">The hatchet too , as in my better days ,</l>
       <l n="74">When victor on Maypocha 's banks I stood ;</l>
       <l n="75">And while the indignant river rolled in blood ,</l>
       <l n="76">And our swift arrows hissed like rushing rain ,</l>
       <l n="77">I cleft Almagro 's iron helm in twain !</l>
       <l n="78">My strength is well-nigh gone ! years marked with woe</l>
       <l n="79">Have o'er me passed , and bowed my spirit low !</l>
       <l n="80">Alas , I have no son ! Beloved boy ,</l>
       <l n="81">Thy father 's last , best hope , his pride , his joy !</l>
       <l n="82">Oh , hadst thou lived , sole object of my prayers , 80</l>
       <l n="83">To guard my waning life , and these gray hairs ,</l>
       <l n="84">How bravely hadst thou now , in manhood 's pride ,</l>
       <l n="85">Swung the uplifted war-club by my side !</l>
       <l n="86">But the Great Spirit willed not ! Thou art gone ;</l>
       <l n="87">And , weary , on this earth I walk alone ;</l>
       <l n="88">Thankful if I may yield my latest breath ,</l>
       <l n="89">And bless my country in the pangs of death !</l>
       <l n="90">With words deliberate , and uplifted hand ,</l>
       <l n="91">Mild to persuade , yet dauntless to command ,</l>
       <l n="92">Raising his hatchet high , Caupolican 90</l>
       <l n="93">Surveyed the assembled chiefs , and thus began :</l>
       <l n="94">Friends , fathers , brothers , dear and sacred names !</l>
       <l n="95">Your stern resolve each ardent look proclaims ;</l>
       <l n="96">On then to conquest ; let one hope inspire ,</l>
       <l n="97">One spirit animate , one vengeance fire !</l>
       <l n="98">Who doubts the glorious issue ! To our foes</l>
       <l n="99">A tenfold strength and spirit we oppose .</l>
       <l n="100">In them no god protects his mortal sons ,</l>
       <l n="101">Or speaks , in thunder , from their roaring guns .</l>
       <l n="102">Nor come they children of the radiant sky ; 100</l>
       <l n="103">But , like the wounded snake , to writhe and die .</l>
       <l n="104">Then , rush resistless on their prostrate bands ,</l>
       <l n="105">Snatch the red lightning from their feeble hands ,</l>

       <l n="35">Yet more , the impatient warrior cried ; yet more !</l>
       <l n="36">Say , shall I live , and drink the tyrant 's gore ?</l>
       <l n="37">‘ Twas silence . Speak ! he cried : none made reply .</l>
       <l n="38">At once strange thunder shook the distant sky ,</l>
       <l n="39">And all was o'er ; the grisly shapes are flown ,</l>
       <l n="40">And the grim warrior stands in the wild woods alone .</l>
       <l n="41">St Pedro 's church had rung its midnight chimes , 110</l>
       <l n="42">And the gray friars were chanting at their primes ,</l>
       <l n="43">When winds , as of a rushing hurricane ,</l>
       <l n="44">Shook the tall windows of the towered fane ;—</l>
       <l n="45">Sounds more than earthly with the storm arose ,</l>
       <l n="46">And a dire troop are passed to Andes ’ snows ,</l>
       <l n="47">Where mighty spirits in mysterious ring</l>
       <l n="48">Their dread prophetic incantations sing ,</l>
       <l n="49">Round Chillan 's crater-smoke , whose lurid light</l>
       <l n="50">Streams high against the hollow cope of night .</l>
       <l n="51">Thy genius , Andes , towering o'er the rest , 120</l>
       <l n="52">Rose vast , and thus a phantom-shape addressed :</l>
       <l n="53">Who comes so swift amid the storm ?</l>
       <l n="54">Ha ! I know thy bloodless form ,</l>
       <l n="55">I know thee , angel , who thou art ,</l>
       <l n="56">By the hissing of thy dart !</l>
       <l n="57">‘ Tis Death , the king ! the rocks around ,</l>
       <l n="58">Hark ! echo back the fearful sound ;—</l>
       <l n="59">‘ Tis Death , the king ! away , away !</l>
       <l n="60">The famished vulture scents its prey .</l>
       <l n="61">Spectre , hence ! we cannot die — 130</l>
       <l n="62">Thy withering weapons we defy ;</l>
       <l n="63">Dire and potent as thou art !</l>
       <l n="64">Then spoke the phantom of the uplifted dart :</l>
       <l n="65">Spirits who in darkness dwell ,</l>
       <l n="66">I heard far off your secret spell !</l>
       <l n="67">Enough , on yonder fatal shore ,</l>
       <l n="68">My fiends have drank your children 's gore ;</l>
       <l n="69">Lo ! I come , and doom to fate</l>
       <l n="70">The murderers , and the foe you hate !</l>
       <l n="71">Of all who shook their hostile spears , 140</l>
       <l n="72">And marked their way through blood and tears ,</l>
       <l n="73">( Now sleeping still on yonder plain )</l>
       <l n="74">But one — one only shall remain ,</l>
       <l n="75">Ere thrice the morn shall shine again .</l>
       <l n="76">Then sang the mighty spirits . Thee , they sing ,</l>
       <l n="77">Hail to thee , Death , all hail to Death , the king !</l>
       <l n="78">The penguin flaps her wings in gore ,</l>
       <l n="79">Devoted Spain , along the shore .</l>
       <l n="80">Whence that shriek ? with ghastly eyes ,</l>
       <l n="81">Thy victor-chief abandoned lies ! 150</l>
       <l n="82">Victor of the southern world ,</l>

       <l n="1">The City of Conception — The City of Penco — Castle — Lautaro — Wild</l>
       <l n="2">Indian Maid — Zarinel — Missionary .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">The second moon had now begun to wane ,</l>
       <l n="4">Since bold Valdivia left the southern plain ;</l>
       <l n="5">Goal of his labours , Penco 's port and bay ,</l>
       <l n="6">Far gleaming to the summer sunset lay .</l>
       <l n="7">The wayworn veteran , who had slowly passed</l>
       <l n="8">Through trackless woods , or o'er savannahs vast ,</l>
       <l n="9">With hope impatient sees the city spires</l>
       <l n="10">Gild the horizon , like ascending fires .</l>
       <l n="11">Now well-known sounds salute him , as more near</l>
       <l n="12">The citadel and battlements appear ; 10</l>
       <l n="13">The approaching trumpets ring at intervals ;</l>
       <l n="14">The trumpet answers from the rampart walls ,</l>
       <l n="15">Where many a maiden casts an anxious eye ,</l>
       <l n="16">Some long-lost object of her love to espy ,</l>
       <l n="17">Or watches , as the evening light illumes</l>
       <l n="18">The points of lances , or the passing plumes .</l>
       <l n="19">The grating drawbridge and the portal-arch ,</l>
       <l n="20">Now echo to the long battalion 's march ;</l>
       <l n="21">Whilst every eye some friend remembered greets ,</l>
       <l n="22">Amid the gazing crowd that throngs the streets . 20</l>
       <l n="23">As bending o'er his mule , amid the throng ,</l>
       <l n="24">Pensive and pale , Anselmo rode along ,</l>
       <l n="25">How sacred , ‘ mid the noise of arms , appeared</l>
       <l n="26">His venerable mien and snowy beard !</l>
       <l n="27">Whilst every heart a silent prayer bestowed ,</l>
       <l n="28">Slow to the convent 's massy gate he rode :</l>
       <l n="29">Around , the brothers , gratulating , stand ,</l>
       <l n="30">And ask for tidings of the southern land .</l>
       <l n="31">As from the turret tolls the vesper bell ,</l>
       <l n="32">He seeks , a weary man , his evening cell , 30</l>
       <l n="33">No sounds of social cheer , no beds of state ,</l>
       <l n="34">Nor gorgeous canopies his coming wait ;</l>
       <l n="35">But o'er a little bread , with folded hands ,</l>
       <l n="36">Thanking the God that gave , a while he stands ;</l>
       <l n="37">Then , while all thoughts of earthly sorrow cease ,</l>
       <l n="38">Upon his pallet lays him down in peace .</l>
       <l n="39">The scene how different , where the castle-hall</l>
       <l n="40">Rings to the loud triumphant festival :</l>
       <l n="41">A hundred torches blaze , and flame aloof ,</l>
       <l n="42">Long quivering shadows streak the vaulted roof ,— 40</l>
       <l n="43">Whilst , seen far off , the illumined windows throw</l>
       <l n="44">A splendour on the shore and seas below .</l>
       <l n="45">Amid his captains , in imperial state ,</l>
       <l n="46">Beneath a crimson canopy , elate ,</l>
       <l n="47">Valdivia sits — and , striking loud the strings ,</l>
       <l n="48">The wandering ministrel of Valentia sings .</l>
       <l n="49">For Chili conquered , fill the bowl again !</l>
       <l n="50">For Chili conquered , raise the heroic strain !</l>
       <l n="51">Lautaro left the hall of jubilee</l>
       <l n="52">Unmarked , and wandered by the moonlit sea : 50</l>
       <l n="53">He heard far off , in dissonant acclaim ,</l>
       <l n="54">The song , the shout , and his loved country 's name .</l>
       <l n="55">As swelled at times the trump 's insulting sound ,</l>
       <l n="56">He raised his eyes impatient from the ground ;</l>
       <l n="57">Then smote his breast indignantly , and cried ,</l>
       <l n="58">Chili ! my country ; would that I had died</l>
       <l n="59">On the sad night of that eventful day</l>
       <l n="60">When on the ground my murdered father lay !</l>
       <l n="61">I should not then , dejected and alone ,</l>
       <l n="62">Have thought I heard his injured spirit groan . 60</l>
       <l n="63">Ha ! was it not his form — his face — his hair ?</l>
       <l n="64">Hold , soldier ! stern , inhuman soldier , spare !</l>
       <l n="65">Ha ! is it not his blood ? Avenge , he cries ,</l>
       <l n="66">Avenge , my son , these wounds ! He faints — he dies !</l>
       <l n="67">Leave me , dread shadow ! Can I then forget</l>
       <l n="68">My father 's look — his voice ? He beckons yet !</l>
       <l n="69">Now on that glimmering rock I see him stand :</l>
       <l n="70">Avenge ! he cries , and waves his dim-seen hand !</l>
       <l n="71">Thus mused the youth , distempered and forlorn ,</l>
       <l n="72">When , hark ! the sound as of a distant horn 70</l>
       <l n="73">Swells o'er the surge ! he turned his look around ,</l>
       <l n="74">And still , with many a pause , he heard the sound :</l>
       <l n="75">It came from yonder rocks ; and , list ! what strain</l>
       <l n="76">Breaks on the silence of the sleeping main ?</l>
       <l n="77">I heard the song of gladness ;</l>
       <l n="78">It seemed but yesterday ,</l>
       <l n="79">But it turned my thoughts to madness ,</l>
       <l n="80">So soon it died away :</l>
       <l n="81">I sound my sea-shell ; but in vain I try</l>
       <l n="82">To bring back that enchanting harmony ! 80</l>
       <l n="83">Hark ! heard ye not the surges say ,</l>
       <l n="84">Oh ! heartless maid , what canst thou do ?</l>
       <l n="85">O'er the moon-gleaming ocean , I 'll wander away ,</l>
       <l n="86">And paddle to Spain in my light canoe !</l>
       <l n="87">The youth drew near , by the strange accents led ,</l>
       <l n="88">Where in a cave , wild sea-weeds round her head ,</l>
       <l n="89">And holding a large sea-conch in her hand ,</l>
       <l n="90">He saw , with wildering air , an Indian maiden stand . 90</l>
       <l n="91">A tattered poncho o'er her shoulders hung ;</l>
       <l n="92">On either side her long black locks were flung ;</l>
       <l n="93">And now by the moon 's glimmer , he espies</l>
       <l n="94">Her high cheek-bones , and bright but hollow eyes .</l>
       <l n="95">Lautaro spoke : Oh ! say what cruel wrong</l>
       <l n="96">Weighs on thy heart , maiden , what bodes thy song ?</l>
       <l n="97">She answered not , but blew her shell again ;</l>
       <l n="98">Then thus renewed the desultory strain :</l>
       <l n="99">Yes , yes , we must forget ! the world is wide ;</l>
       <l n="100">My music now shall be the dashing tide : 100</l>
       <l n="101">In the calm of the deep I will frolic and swim —</l>
       <l n="102">With the breath of the South o'er the sea-blossom<span type="note_anchor">[ 225 ]</span>skim .</l>
       <l n="103">If ever , stranger , on thy way ,</l>
       <l n="104">Sounds , more than earthly sweet , thy soul should move ,</l>
       <l n="105">It is the youth ! Oh ! do not say —</l>
       <l n="106">That poor Olola died for love .</l>
       <l n="107">Lautaro stretched his hand ; she said , Adieu !</l>
       <l n="108">And o'er the glimmering rocks like lightning flew .</l>
       <l n="109">He followed , and still heard at distance swell</l>
       <l n="110">The lessening echoes of that mournful shell . 110</l>
       <l n="111">It ceased at once ; and now he heard no more</l>
       <l n="112">Than the sea 's murmur dying on the shore .</l>
       <l n="113">Olola !— ha ! his sister had that name !</l>
       <l n="114">Oh , horrid fancies ! shake not thus his frame !</l>
       <l n="115">All night he wandered by the desert main ,</l>
       <l n="116">To catch the melancholy sounds again .</l>
       <l n="117">No torches blaze in Penco 's castled hall</l>
       <l n="118">That echoed to the midnight festival .</l>
       <l n="119">The weary soldiers by their toils oppressed ,</l>
       <l n="120">Had now retired to silence and to rest . 120</l>
       <l n="121">The minstrel only , who the song had sung</l>
       <l n="122">Of noble Cid , as o'er the strings he hung ,</l>
       <l n="123">Upon the instrument had fall'n asleep ,</l>
       <l n="124">Weary , and now was hushed in slumbers deep .</l>
       <l n="125">Tracing the scenes long past , in busy dreams</l>
       <l n="126">Again he wanders by his native streams ;</l>
       <l n="127">Or sits , his evening saraband to sing</l>
       <l n="128">To the clear Garonne 's gentle murmuring .</l>
       <l n="129">Cold o'er the fleckered clouds the morning broke</l>
       <l n="130">Aslant ere from his slumbers he awoke ; 130</l>
       <l n="131">Still as he sat , nor yet had left the place ,</l>
       <l n="132">The first dim light fell on his pallid face .</l>
       <l n="133">He wakes — he gazes round — the dawning day</l>
       <l n="134">Comes from the deep , in garb of cloudy gray .</l>
       <l n="135">The woods with crow of early turkeys ring ,</l>
       <l n="136">The glancing birds beneath the castle sing ,</l>
       <l n="137">And the sole sun his rising orb displays ,</l>
       <l n="138">Radiant and reddening , through the scattered haze .</l>
       <l n="139">To recreate the languid sense a while ,</l>
       <l n="140">When earth and ocean wore their sweetest smile , 140</l>
       <l n="141">He wandered to the beach : the early air</l>
       <l n="142">Blew soft , and lifted , as it blew , his hair ;</l>
       <l n="143">Flushed was his cheek ; his faded eye , more bright ,</l>
       <l n="144">Shone with a faint but animated light ,</l>
       <l n="145">While the soft morning ray seemed to bestow</l>
       <l n="146">On his tired mind a transient kindred glow .</l>
       <l n="147">As thus , with shadow stretching o'er the sand ,</l>
       <l n="148">He mused and wandered on the winding strand ,</l>
       <l n="149">At distance tossed upon the tumbling tide ,</l>
       <l n="150">A dark and floating substance he espied . 150</l>
       <l n="151">He stood , and where the eddying surges beat ,</l>
       <l n="152">An Indian corse was rolled beneath his feet :</l>
       <l n="153">The hollow wave retired with sullen sound ;</l>
       <l n="154">The face of that sad corse was to the ground ;</l>
       <l n="155">It seemed a female , by the slender form ;</l>
       <l n="156">He touched the hand — it was no longer warm ;</l>
       <l n="157">He turned its face — O God ! that eye , though dim ,</l>
       <l n="158">Seemed with its deadly glare as fixed on him !</l>
       <l n="159">How sunk his shuddering sense , how changed his hue ,</l>
       <l n="160">When poor Olola in that corse he knew ! 160</l>
       <l n="161">Lautaro , rushing from the rocks , advanced ;</l>
       <l n="162">His keen eye , like a startled eagle 's glanced :</l>
       <l n="163">‘ Tis she !— he knew her by a mark impressed</l>
       <l n="164">From earliest infancy beneath her breast .</l>
       <l n="165">Oh , my poor sister ! when all hopes were past</l>
       <l n="166">Of meeting , do we meet — thus meet — at last !</l>
       <l n="167">Then full on Zarinel , as one amazed ,</l>
       <l n="168">With rising wrath and stern suspicion gazed ;</l>
       <l n="169">For Zarinel still knelt upon the sand ,</l>
       <l n="170">And to his forehead pressed the dead maid 's hand . 170</l>
       <l n="171">Speak ! whence art thou ?</l>
       <l n="172">Pale Zarinel , his head</l>
       <l n="173">Upraising answered ,</l>
       <l n="174">Peace is with the dead !</l>
       <l n="175">Him dost thou seek who injured thine and thee ?</l>
       <l n="176">Here — strike the fell assassin — I am he !</l>
       <l n="177">Die ! he exclaimed , and with convulsive start</l>
       <l n="178">Instant had plunged the dagger in his heart ,</l>
       <l n="179">When the meek father , with his holy book ,</l>
       <l n="180">And placid aspect , met his frenzied look . 180</l>
       <l n="181">He trembled — struck his brow — and , turning round ,</l>
       <l n="182">Flung the uplifted dagger to the ground .</l>
       <l n="183">Then murmured : Father , Heaven has heard thy prayer —</l>
       <l n="184">But oh ! the sister of my soul lies there !</l>
       <l n="185">The Christian 's God has triumphed ! father , heap</l>
       <l n="186">Some earth upon her bones , whilst I go weep !</l>
       <l n="187">Anselmo with calm brow approached the place ,</l>
       <l n="188">And hastened with his staff his faltering pace :</l>
       <l n="189">Ho ! child of guilt and wretchedness , he cried ,</l>
       <l n="190">Speak !— Holy father , the sad youth replied , 190</l>
       <l n="191">God bade the seas the accusing victim roll</l>
       <l n="192">Dead at my feet , to teach my shuddering soul</l>
       <l n="193">Its guilt : Oh ! father , holy father , pray</l>
       <l n="194">That heaven may take the deep , dire curse away !</l>
       <l n="195">Oh ! yet , Anselmo cried , live and repent ,</l>
       <l n="196">For not in vain was this dread warning sent ;</l>
       <l n="197">The deep reproaches of thy soul I spare ,</l>
       <l n="198">Go ! seek Heaven 's peace by penitence and prayer .</l>
       <l n="199">The youth arose , yet trembling from the shock ,</l>
       <l n="200">And severed from the dead maid 's hair a lock ; 200</l>
       <l n="201">This to his heart with trembling hand he pressed ,</l>
       <l n="202">And dried the salt-sea moisture on his breast .</l>
       <l n="203">They laid her limbs within the sea-beat grave ,</l>
       <l n="204">And prayed : Her soul , O blessed Mary , save !</l>

       <l n="6">Smoke rolled , and thunder echoed o'er the wave ;</l>
       <l n="7">When , starting from his couch , Valdivia cried ,</l>
       <l n="8">What tidings ? Of the tribes ! a scout replied ;</l>
       <l n="9">Ev'n now , prepared thy bulwarks to assail ,</l>
       <l n="10">Their gathering numbers darken all the vale !</l>
       <l n="11">Valdivia called to the attendant youth ,</l>
       <l n="12">Philip , he cried , belike thy words have truth ; 10</l>
       <l n="13">The formidable host , by holy James ,</l>
       <l n="14">Might well appal our priests and city dames !</l>
       <l n="15">Dost thou not fear ? Nay — dost thou not reply ?</l>
       <l n="16">Now by the rood , and all the saints on high ,</l>
       <l n="17">I hold it sin that thou shouldst lift thy hand</l>
       <l n="18">Against thy brothers in thy native land !</l>
       <l n="19">But , as thou saidst , those mighty enemies</l>
       <l n="20">Me and my feeble legions would despise .</l>
       <l n="21">Yes , by our holy lady , thou shalt ride ,</l>
       <l n="22">Spectator of their prowess , by my side ! 20</l>
       <l n="23">Come life , come death , our battle shall display</l>
       <l n="24">Its ensigns to the earliest beam of day !</l>
       <l n="25">With louder summons ring the rampart-bell ,</l>
       <l n="26">And haste the shriving father from his cell ;</l>
       <l n="27">A soldier 's heart rejoices in alarms :</l>
       <l n="28">And let the trump at midnight sound to arms !</l>
       <l n="29">And now , obedient to the chief 's commands ,</l>
       <l n="30">The gray-haired priest before the soldier stands .</l>
       <l n="31">Father , Valdivia cried , fierce are our foes ,—</l>
       <l n="32">The last event of war GOD only knows ;— 30</l>
       <l n="33">Let mass be sung ; father , this very night</l>
       <l n="34">I would attend the high and holy rite .</l>
       <l n="35">Yet deem not that I doubt of victory ,</l>
       <l n="36">Or place defeat or death before mine eye ;</l>
       <l n="37">It blenches not ! But , whatsoe'er befall ,</l>
       <l n="38">Good father , I would part in peace with all .</l>
       <l n="39">So , tell Lautaro — his ingenuous mind</l>
       <l n="40">Perhaps may grieve , if late I seemed unkind :—</l>
       <l n="41">Hear my heart speak , though far from virtue 's way</l>
       <l n="42">Ambition 's lure hath led my steps astray , 40</l>
       <l n="43">No wanton exercise of barbarous power</l>
       <l n="44">Harrows my shrinking conscience at this hour .</l>
       <l n="45">If hasty passions oft my spirit fire ,</l>
       <l n="46">They flash a moment and the next expire ;</l>
       <l n="47">Lautaro knows it . There is somewhat more :</l>
       <l n="48">I would not , here — here , on this distant shore</l>
       <l n="49">( Should they , the Indian multitudes , prevail ,</l>
       <l n="50">And this good sword and these firm sinews fail )</l>

       <l n="52">“ Unhouseled , ananealed , ” upon the ground , 50</l>
       <l n="53">A dying man ;— thy look , thy reverend age ,</l>
       <l n="54">Might save my poor remains from barb'rous rage ;</l>
       <l n="55">And thou may'st pay the last sad obsequies ,</l>

       <l n="104">With watchful caution , on his fleetest steed ,</l>

       <l n="116">His features through the barred casque that glow ,</l>
       <l n="117">His pole-axe pendent from the saddle-bow ;</l>
       <l n="118">His dazzling armour , and the glitter bright</l>

       <l n="123">The attendant youth rode , pensive , by his side .</l>
       <l n="124">Their pennoned lances , waving in the wind ,</l>
       <l n="125">Two hundred clanking horsemen tramped behind ,</l>
       <l n="126">In iron harness clad . The bugles blew ,</l>

       <l n="128">The arbalasters { j } next , with cross-bows slung ,</l>
       <l n="129">Marched , whilst the plumed Moors their cymbals swung .</l>
       <l n="130">Auxiliar-Indians here , a various train .</l>
       <l n="131">With spears and bows , darkened the distant plain ;</l>
       <l n="132">Drums rolled , and fifes re-echoed shrill and clear , 130</l>
       <l n="133">At intervals , as near and yet more near ,</l>
       <l n="134">While flags and intermingled halberds shine ,</l>
       <l n="135">The long battalion drew its passing line .</l>
       <l n="136">Last rolled the heavy guns , a sable tier ,</l>
       <l n="137">By Indians drawn , with matchmen in the rear ;</l>
       <l n="138">And many a straggling mule and sumpter-train</l>
       <l n="139">Closed the embattled order on the plain ,</l>
       <l n="140">Till nought beneath the azure sky appears</l>
       <l n="141">But the projecting points of scarce-discovered spears ,</l>
       <l n="142">Slow up the hill , with floating vapours hoar , 140</l>
       <l n="143">Or by the blue lake 's long retiring shore ,</l>
       <l n="144">Now seen distinct , through the disparting haze ,</l>
       <l n="145">The glittering file its bannered length displays ;</l>
       <l n="146">Now winding from the woods , again appears</l>
       <l n="147">The moving line of matchlocks and of spears .</l>
       <l n="148">Part seen , part lost ; the long illustrious march</l>
       <l n="149">Circling the swamp , now draws its various arch ;</l>
       <l n="150">And seems , as on it moves , meandering slow ,</l>
       <l n="151">A radiant segment of a living bow .</l>
       <l n="152">Five days the Spaniards , trooping in array , 150</l>
       <l n="153">O'er plains and headlands , held their eastern way .</l>
       <l n="154">On the sixth early dawn , with shuddering awe</l>
       <l n="155">And horror , in the last defile they saw</l>
       <l n="156">Ten pendent heads , from which the gore still run ,</l>
       <l n="157">All gashed , and grim , and blackening in the sun .</l>
       <l n="158">These were the gallant troop that passed before ,</l>
       <l n="159">The Indians ’ vast encampment to explore ,</l>
       <l n="160">Led by Del Oro , now with many a wound</l>
       <l n="161">Pierced , and a headless trunk upon the ground .</l>
       <l n="162">The horses startled , as they tramped in blood ; 160</l>
       <l n="163">The troops a moment half-recoiling stood .</l>
       <l n="164">But boots not now to pause , or to retire ;</l>
       <l n="165">Valdivia 's eye flashed with indignant fire :</l>
       <l n="166">Follow ! he cried , brave comrades , to the hill !</l>
       <l n="167">And instant shouts the pealing valley fill .</l>
       <l n="168">And now , up to the hill 's ascending crest ,</l>
       <l n="169">With animated look and beating breast ,</l>
       <l n="170">He urged his steed ; when , wide beneath his eye ,</l>
       <l n="171">He saw , in long expanse , Arauco 's valley lie .</l>
       <l n="172">Far as the labouring sight could stretch its glance , 170</l>
       <l n="173">One undulating mass of club and lance ,</l>
       <l n="174">One animated surface seemed to fill</l>
       <l n="175">The many-stirring scene from hill to hill :</l>
       <l n="176">To the deep mass he pointed with his sword ,</l>
       <l n="177">Banner , advance ! give out “ Castile ! ” the word .</l>
       <l n="178">Instant the files advance , the trumpets bray ,</l>
       <l n="179">And now the host in terrible array ,</l>
       <l n="180">Ranged on the heights that overlook the plain ,</l>
       <l n="181">Has halted !</l>
       <l n="182">But the task were long and vain 180</l>
       <l n="183">To tell what nations , from the seas that roar</l>
       <l n="184">Round Patagonia 's melancholy shore ;</l>
       <l n="185">From forests , brown with everlasting shades ;</l>
       <l n="186">From rocks of sunshine , white with prone cascades ;</l>
       <l n="187">From snowy summits , where the Llama roams ,</l>
       <l n="188">Oft bending o'er the cataract as it foams ;</l>
       <l n="189">From streams whose bridges<span type="note_anchor">[ 229 ]</span>tremble from the steep ;</l>
       <l n="190">From lakes , in summer 's sweetest light asleep ;</l>
       <l n="191">Indians , of sullen brow and giant limb ,</l>
       <l n="192">With clubs terrific , and with aspects grim , 190</l>
       <l n="193">Flocked fearless .</l>
       <l n="194">When they saw the Spanish line</l>
       <l n="195">Arrayed , and front to front , descending shine ,</l>
       <l n="196">Burst , instant burst , the universal cry ,</l>
       <l n="197">( Ten thousand spears uplifted to the sky ) —</l>
       <l n="198">Tyrants , we come to conquer or to die !</l>
       <l n="199">Grim Mariantu led the Indian force</l>
       <l n="200">A-left ; and , rushing to the foremost horse ,</l>
       <l n="201">Hurled with unerring aim the involving thong ,</l>
       <l n="202">Then fearless sprang amidst the mailed throng . 200</l>
       <l n="203">Valdivia saw the horse , entangled , reel ,</l>
       <l n="204">And shouting , as he rode , Castile ! Castile !</l>
       <l n="205">Led on the charge : like a descending flood ,</l>
       <l n="206">It swept , till every spur was black with blood .</l>
       <l n="207">His force a-right , where Harratomac led ,</l>
       <l n="208">A thousand spears went hissing overhead ,</l>
       <l n="209">And feathered arrows , of each varying hue ,</l>
       <l n="210">In glancing arch , beneath the sunbeams flew .</l>
       <l n="211">Dire was the strife , when ardent Teucapel</l>
       <l n="212">Advancing in the front of carnage fell . 210</l>
       <l n="213">At once , Ongolmo , Elicura , rushed ,</l>
       <l n="214">And swaying their huge clubs together , crushed</l>
       <l n="215">Horseman and horse ; then bathed their hands in gore ,</l>
       <l n="216">And limb from limb the panting carcase tore .</l>
       <l n="217">Caupolican , where the main battle bleeds ,</l>
       <l n="218">Hosts and succeeding hosts undaunted leads ,</l>
       <l n="219">Till , torn and shattered by the ceaseless fire ,</l>
       <l n="220">Thousands , with gnashing teeth , and clenched spears , expire .</l>
       <l n="221">Pierced by a hundred wounds , Ongolmo lies ,</l>
       <l n="222">And grasps his club terrific as he dies . 220</l>
       <l n="223">With breathless expectation , on the height ,</l>
       <l n="224">Lautaro watched the long and dubious fight :</l>
       <l n="225">Pale and resigned the meek man stood , and pressed</l>
       <l n="226">More close the holy image to his breast .</l>
       <l n="227">Now nearer to the fight Lautaro drew ,</l>
       <l n="228">When on the ground a warrior met his view ,</l>
       <l n="229">Upon whose features memory seemed to trace</l>
       <l n="230">A faint resemblance of his father 's face ;</l>
       <l n="231">O'er him a horseman , with collected might ,</l>
       <l n="232">Raised his uplifted sword , in act to smite , 230</l>
       <l n="233">When the youth springing on , without a word ,</l>
       <l n="234">Snatched from a soldier 's wearied grasp his sword ,</l>
       <l n="235">And smote the horseman through the crest : a yell</l>
       <l n="236">Of triumph burst , as to the ground he fell .</l>
       <l n="237">Lautaro { k } shouted , On ! brave brothers , on !</l>
       <l n="238">Scatter them like the snow !— the day is won !</l>
       <l n="239">Lo , I ! Lautaro { k },— Attacapac 's son !</l>
       <l n="240">The Indians turn : again the battle bleeds ,</l>
       <l n="241">Cleft are the helms and crushed the struggling steeds .</l>
       <l n="242">The bugle sounds , and faint with toil and heat , 240</l>
       <l n="243">Some straggling horsemen to the hills retreat .</l>
       <l n="244">Stand , brave companions ! bold Valdivia cried ,</l>
       <l n="245">And shook his sword , in recent carnage dyed ;</l>
       <l n="246">Oh ! droop not — droop not yet — all is not o'er —</l>
       <l n="247">Brave , faithful friends , one glorious sally more .</l>
       <l n="248">Where is Lautaro ! leaps his willing sword</l>
       <l n="249">Now to avenge his long-indulgent lord !</l>
       <l n="250">He waited not for answer , but again</l>
       <l n="251">Spurred to the centre of the horrid plain .</l>
       <l n="252">Clubs , arrows , spears , the spot of death inclose , 250</l>
       <l n="253">And fainter now the Spanish shouts arose .</l>
       <l n="254">‘ Mid ghastly heaps of many a bleeding corse ,</l>
       <l n="255">Lies the caparisoned and dying horse .</l>
       <l n="256">While still the rushing multitudes assail ,</l>
       <l n="257">Vain is the fiery tube , the twisted mail !</l>
       <l n="258">The Spanish horsemen faint ; long yells resound ,</l>
       <l n="259">As the dragged ensign trails the gory ground :</l>
       <l n="260">Shout , for the chief is seized !— a thousand cries</l>
       <l n="261">Burst forth — Valdivia ! for the sacrifice !</l>
       <l n="262">And lo , in silent dignity resigned , 260</l>
       <l n="263">The meek Anselmo , led in bonds , behind !</l>
       <l n="264">His hand upon his breast , young Zarinel</l>
       <l n="265">Amidst a group of mangled Indians fell ;</l>
       <l n="266">The spear that to his heart a passage found</l>
       <l n="267">Left poor Olola 's hair within the wound .</l>
       <l n="268">Now all is hushed , save where , at times , alone ,</l>
       <l n="269">Deep midnight listens to a distant moan ;</l>
       <l n="270">Save where the condors clamour , overhead ,</l>
       <l n="271">And strike with sounding beaks the helmets of the dead .</l>

      <head>Indian festival for victory — Old Warrior brought in wounded — Recognises his long-lost son , and dies — Discovery — Conclusion with the Old Warrior 's funeral , and prophetic oration by the Missionary .</head>
       <l n="1">The morn returns , and , reddening , seems to shed</l>
       <l n="2">One ray of glory on the patriot-dead .</l>
       <l n="3">Round the dark stone , the victor-chiefs behold !</l>
       <l n="4">Still on their locks the gouts of gore hang cold !</l>
       <l n="5">There stands the brave Caupolican , the pride</l>
       <l n="6">Of Chili , young Lautaro , by his side !</l>
       <l n="7">Near the grim circle , pendent from the wood ,</l>
       <l n="8">Twelve hundred Spanish heads are dripping blood .</l>
       <l n="9">Shrill sound the notes of death : in festive dance ,</l>
       <l n="10">The Indian maids with myrtle boughs advance ; 10</l>
       <l n="11">The tinkling sea-shells on their ancles ring ,</l>
       <l n="12">As , hailing thus the victor-youth , they sing :—</l>

      <head>SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Oh , shout for Lautaro , the young and the brave !</l>
       <l n="2">The arm of whose strength was uplifted to save ,</l>
       <l n="3">When the steeds of the strangers came rushing amain ,</l>
       <l n="4">And the ghosts of our fathers looked down on the slain !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">‘ Twas eve , and the noise of the battle was o'er ,</l>
       <l n="6">Five thousand brave warriors were cold in their gore ;</l>
       <l n="7">When , in front , young Lautaro invincible stood ,</l>
       <l n="8">And the horses and iron-men rolled in their blood !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">As the snows of the mountain are swept by the blast ,</l>
       <l n="10">The earthquake of death o'er the white men has passed ;</l>
       <l n="11">Shout , Chili , in triumph ! the battle is won ,</l>
       <l n="12">And we dance round the heads that are black in the sun !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">Lautaro , as if wrapt in thought profound ,</l>
       <l n="14">Oft turned an anxious look inquiring round .</l>
       <l n="15">He is not here !— Say , does my father live ? 15</l>
       <l n="16">Ere eager voices could an answer give ,</l>
       <l n="17">With faltering footsteps and declining head ,</l>
       <l n="18">And slowly by an aged Indian led ,</l>
       <l n="19">Wounded and weak the mountain chief appears :</l>
       <l n="20">Live , live ! Lautaro cried , with bursting tears , 20</l>
       <l n="21">And fell upon his neck , and , kissing , pressed ,</l>
       <l n="22">With folding arms , his gray hairs to his breast .</l>
       <l n="23">Oh , live ! I am thy son — thy long-lost child !</l>
       <l n="24">The warrior raised his look , and faintly smiled ;</l>
       <l n="25">Chili , my country , is avenged ! he cried :</l>
       <l n="26">My son !— then sunk upon a shield — and died .</l>
       <l n="27">Lautaro knelt beside him , as he bowed ,</l>
       <l n="28">And kissed his bleeding breast , and wept aloud .</l>
       <l n="29">The sounds of sadness through the circle ran ,</l>
       <l n="30">When thus , with lifted axe , Caupolican : 30</l>
       <l n="31">What , for our fathers , brothers , children , slain ,</l>
       <l n="32">Canst thou repay , ruthless , inhuman Spain ?</l>
       <l n="33">Here , on the scene with recent slaughter red ,</l>
       <l n="34">To sooth the spirits of the brave who bled ,</l>
       <l n="35">Raise we , to-day , the war-feast of the dead .</l>
       <l n="36">Bring forth the chief in bonds ! Fathers , to-day</l>
       <l n="37">Devote we to our gods the noblest prey !</l>
       <l n="38">Lautaro turned his eyes , and , gazing round ,</l>
       <l n="39">Beheld Valdivia and Anselmo bound !</l>
       <l n="40">One stood in arms , as with a stern despair , 40</l>
       <l n="41">His helmet cleft in twain , his temples bare ,</l>
       <l n="42">Where streaks of blood that dropped upon his mail ,</l>
       <l n="43">Served but to show his face more deadly pale :</l>
       <l n="44">His eyebrows , dark and resolute , he bent ,</l>
       <l n="45">And stood , composed , to wait the dire event .</l>
       <l n="46">Still on the cross his looks Anselmo cast ,</l>
       <l n="47">As if all thought of this vain world was passed ,</l>
       <l n="48">And in a world of light , without a shade ,</l>
       <l n="49">Ev'n now his meek and guileless spirit strayed .</l>
       <l n="50">Where stood the Spanish chief , a muttering sound 50</l>
       <l n="51">Rose , and each club was lifted from the ground ;</l>
       <l n="52">When , starting from his father 's corse , his sword</l>
       <l n="53">Waving before his once-triumphant lord ,</l>
       <l n="54">Lautaro cried , My breast shall meet the blow :</l>
       <l n="55">But save — save him , to whom my life I owe !</l>
       <l n="56">Valdivia marked him with unmoving eye ,</l>
       <l n="57">Then looked upon his bonds , nor deigned reply ;</l>
       <l n="58">When Harratomac , stealing with slow pace ,</l>
       <l n="59">And lifting high his iron-jagged mace ,</l>
       <l n="60">Smote him to earth ; a thousand voices rose , 60</l>
       <l n="61">Mingled with shouts and yells , So fall our foes !</l>
       <l n="62">Lautaro gave to tears a moment 's space ,</l>
       <l n="63">As black in death he marked Valdivia 's face ,</l>
       <l n="64">Then cried — Chiefs , friends , and thou , Caupolican ,</l>
       <l n="65">Oh , spare this innocent and holy man !</l>
       <l n="66">He never sailed , rapacious , o'er the deep ,</l>
       <l n="67">The gold of blood-polluted lands to heap ;</l>
       <l n="68">He never gave the armed hosts his aid ,</l>
       <l n="69">But meekly to the Mighty Spirit prayed ,</l>
       <l n="70">That in all lands the sounds of woe might cease , 70</l>
       <l n="71">And brothers of the wide world dwell in peace !</l>
       <l n="72">The victor-youth saw generous sympathy</l>
       <l n="73">Already steal to every warrior 's eye ;</l>
       <l n="74">Then thus again : Oh , if this filial tear</l>
       <l n="75">Bear witness my own father was most dear ;</l>
       <l n="76">If this uplifted arm , this bleeding steel</l>
       <l n="77">Speak for my country what I felt and feel ;</l>
       <l n="78">If , at this hour , I meet her high applause ,</l>
       <l n="79">While my heart beats still ardent in her cause ;—</l>
       <l n="80">Hear , and forgive these tears that grateful flow , 80</l>
       <l n="81">Oh ! hear , how much to this poor man I owe !</l>
       <l n="82">I was a child — when to my sire 's abode ,</l>
       <l n="83">In Chillan 's vale , the armed horsemen rode :</l>
       <l n="84">Me , whilst my father cold and breathless lay ,</l>
       <l n="85">Far off the crested soldiers bore away ,</l>
       <l n="86">And for a captive sold . No friend was near ,</l>
       <l n="87">To mark a young and orphan stranger 's tear !</l>
       <l n="88">This humble man , with kind parental care ,</l>
       <l n="89">Snatched me from slavery — saved from dark despair ;</l>
       <l n="90">And as my years increased , protected , fed , 90</l>
       <l n="91">And breathed a father 's blessings on my head .</l>
       <l n="92">A Spanish maid was with him : need I speak ?</l>
       <l n="93">Behold , affection 's tear still wets my cheek !</l>
       <l n="94">Years , as they passed , matured in ripening grace</l>
       <l n="95">Her form unfolding , and her beauteous face :</l>
       <l n="96">She heard my orphan tale ; she loved to hear ,</l>
       <l n="97">And sometimes for my fortunes dropped a tear .</l>
       <l n="98">I could have bowed to direst ills resigned ,</l>
       <l n="99">But wept at looks so sweet , at words so kind .</l>
       <l n="100">Valdivia saw me , now in blooming age , 100</l>
       <l n="101">And claimed me from the father as his page ;</l>
       <l n="102">The chief too cherished me , yea , saved my life ,</l>
       <l n="103">When in Peru arose the civil strife .</l>
       <l n="104">Yet still remembering her I loved so well ,</l>
       <l n="105">Oft I returned to the gray father 's cell :</l>
       <l n="106">His voice instructed me ; recalled my youth</l>
       <l n="107">From rude idolatry to heavenly truth :</l>
       <l n="108">Of this hereafter ; he my darkling mind</l>
       <l n="109">Cleared , and from low and sensual thoughts refined .</l>
       <l n="110">Then first , with feelings new impressed , I strove 110</l>
       <l n="111">To hide the tear of tenderness and love :</l>
       <l n="112">Amid the fairest maidens of Peru ,</l>
       <l n="113">My eyes , my heart , one only object knew :</l>
       <l n="114">I lived that object 's love and faith to share ;</l>
       <l n="115">He saw , and blessed us with a father 's prayer .</l>
       <l n="116">Here , at Valdivia 's last and stern command ,</l>
       <l n="117">I came , a stranger in my native land !</l>
       <l n="118">Anselmo ( so him call — now most in need —</l>
       <l n="119">And standing here in bonds , for whom I plead )</l>
       <l n="120">Came , by our chief so summoned , and for aid 120</l>
       <l n="121">To the Great Spirit of the Christians prayed :</l>
       <l n="122">Here as a son I loved him , but I left</l>
       <l n="123">A wife , a child , of my fond cares bereft ,</l>
       <l n="124">Never to see again ; for death awaits</l>
       <l n="125">My entrance now in Lima 's jealous gates .</l>
       <l n="126">Caupolican , didst thou thy father love ?</l>
       <l n="127">Did his last dying look affection move ?</l>
       <l n="128">Pity this aged man ; unbend thy brow :</l>
       <l n="129">He was my father — is my father , now !</l>
       <l n="130">Consenting mercy marks each warrior 's mien . 130</l>
       <l n="131">But who is this , what pallid form is seen ,</l>
       <l n="132">As crushed already by the fatal blow ,</l>
       <l n="133">Bound , and with looks white as a wreath of snow ,</l>
       <l n="134">Her hands upon her breast , scarce drawn her breath ,</l>
       <l n="135">A Spanish woman knelt , expecting death ,</l>
       <l n="136">Whilst , borne by a dark warrior at her side ,</l>
       <l n="137">An infant shrunk from the red plumes , and cried !</l>
       <l n="138">Lautaro started :</l>
       <l n="139">Injured maid of Spain !</l>
       <l n="140">Me !— me ! oh , take me to thine arms again ! 140</l>
       <l n="141">She heard his voice , and , by the scene oppressed ,</l>
       <l n="142">With one faint sigh fell senseless on his breast .</l>
       <l n="143">Caupolican , with warm emotion , cried ,</l>
       <l n="144">Live , live ! Lautaro and his beauteous bride !</l>
       <l n="145">Live , aged father !— and forthwith commands</l>
       <l n="146">A warrior to unbind Anselmo 's hands .</l>
       <l n="147">She raised her head : his eyes first met her view ,</l>
       <l n="148">As round Lautaro 's neck her arms she threw ,</l>
       <l n="149">Ah , no ! she feebly spoke ; it is not true !</l>
       <l n="150">It is some form of the distempered brain ! 150</l>
       <l n="151">Then hid her face upon his breast again .</l>
       <l n="152">Dark flashing eyes , terrific , glared around :</l>
       <l n="153">Here , his brains scattered by the deadly wound ,</l>
       <l n="154">The Spanish chief lay on the gory ground .</l>
       <l n="155">With lowering brows , and mace yet drooping blood ,</l>
       <l n="156">And clotted hair , there Mariantu stood .</l>
       <l n="157">Anselmo here , sad , yet in sorrow mild ,</l>
       <l n="158">Appeared : she cried , A blessing on your child ,</l>
       <l n="159">And knelt , as slow revived her waking sense ,</l>
       <l n="160">And then , with looks aghast , Oh bear us hence ! 160</l>
       <l n="161">Now all the assembled chiefs , assenting , cried ,</l>
       <l n="162">Live , live ! Lautaro and his beauteous bride !</l>
       <l n="163">With eager arms Lautaro snatched his boy ,</l>
       <l n="164">And kissed him in an agony of joy ;</l>
       <l n="165">Then to Anselmo gave , who strove to speak ,</l>
       <l n="166">And felt the tear first burning on his cheek :</l>
       <l n="167">The infant held his neck with strict embrace ,</l>
       <l n="168">And kissed his pale emaciated face .</l>
       <l n="169">From the dread scene , wet with Valdivia 's gore ,</l>
       <l n="170">His wan and trembling charge Lautaro bore . 170</l>
       <l n="171">There was a bank , where slept the summer-light ,</l>
       <l n="172">A small stream whispering went in mazes bright ,</l>
       <l n="173">And stealing from the sea , the western wind</l>
       <l n="174">Waved the magnolias on the slope inclined :</l>
       <l n="175">The woodpecker , in glittering plumage green ,</l>
       <l n="176">And echoing bill , beneath the boughs was seen ;</l>
       <l n="177">And , arched with gay and pendent flowers above ,</l>
       <l n="178">The floripondio<span type="note_anchor">[ 230 ]</span>its rich trellis wove .</l>
       <l n="179">Lautaro bent , with looks of love and joy ,</l>
       <l n="180">O'er his yet trembling wife and beauteous boy : 180</l>
       <l n="181">Oh , by what miracle , beloved ! say ,</l>
       <l n="182">Hast thou escaped the perils of the way</l>
       <l n="183">From Lima , where our humble dwelling stood ,</l>
       <l n="184">To these tumultuous scenes , this vale of blood ?</l>
       <l n="185">Roused by his voice , as from the sleep of death ,</l>
       <l n="186">Faint she replied , with slow-recovering breath ,</l>
       <l n="187">Who shall express , when thou , best friend ! wert gone ,</l>
       <l n="188">How sunk my heart !— deserted and alone !</l>
       <l n="189">Would I were with thee ! oft I sat and sighed ,</l>
       <l n="190">When the pale moon shone on the silent tide — 190</l>
       <l n="191">At length resolved , I sought thee o'er the seas :</l>
       <l n="192">The brave bark cheer'ly went before the breeze ,</l>
       <l n="193">That arms and soldiers to Valdivia bore ,</l>
       <l n="194">From Lima bound to Chili 's southern shore :</l>
       <l n="195">I seized the fair occasion — ocean smiled ,</l>
       <l n="196">As to the sire I bore his lisping child .</l>
       <l n="197">The storm arose : with loud and sudden shock</l>
       <l n="198">The vessel sunk , disparting on a rock .</l>
       <l n="199">Some mariners , amidst the billows wild ,</l>
       <l n="200">Scarce saved , in one small boat , me and my child . 200</l>
       <l n="201">What I have borne , a captive since that day —</l>
       <l n="202">Forgive these tears — I scarce have heart to say !</l>
       <l n="203">None pitied , save one gentle Indian maid —</l>
       <l n="204">A wild maid — of her looks I was afraid ;</l>
       <l n="205">Her long black hair upon her shoulders fell ,</l>
       <l n="206">And in her hand she bore a wreathed shell .</l>
       <l n="207">Lautaro for a moment turned aside ,</l>
       <l n="208">And , Oh , my sister ! with faint voice he cried .</l>
       <l n="209">Already free from sorrow and alarms ,</l>
       <l n="210">I clasped in thought a husband in my arms , 210</l>
       <l n="211">When a dark warrior , stationed on the height ,</l>
       <l n="212">Who held his solitary watch by night ,</l>
       <l n="213">Before me stood , and lifting high his lance ,</l>
       <l n="214">Exclaimed : No further , on thy life , advance !</l>
       <l n="215">Faint , wearied , sinking to the earth with dread ,</l>
       <l n="216">Back to the dismal cave my steps he led .</l>
       <l n="217">Only at eve , within the craggy cleft ,</l>
       <l n="218">Some water , and a cake of maize , were left .</l>
       <l n="219">The thirteenth sun unseen went down the sky ;</l>
       <l n="220">When morning came , they brought me forth to die ;</l>
       <l n="221">But hushed be every sigh , each boding fear ,</l>
       <l n="222">Since all I sought on earth , and all I love , is here ! 220</l>
       <l n="223">Her infant raised his hands , with glistening eye ,</l>
       <l n="224">To reach a large and radiant butterfly ,</l>
       <l n="225">That fluttered near his face ; with looks of love ,</l>
       <l n="226">And truth and tenderness , Lautaro strove</l>
       <l n="227">To calm her wounded heart ; the holy sire ,</l>
       <l n="228">His eyes faint-lighted with a transient fire ,</l>
       <l n="229">Hung o'er them , and to Heaven his prayer addressed ,</l>
       <l n="230">While , with uplifted hands , he wept and blest . 230</l>
       <l n="231">An aged Indian came , with feathers crowned ,</l>
       <l n="232">And knelt before Lautaro on the ground .</l>
       <l n="233">What tidings , Indian ?</l>

      <head>INDIAN .</head>
       <l n="1">When I led thy sire ,</l>
       <l n="2">Whom late thou saw'st upon his shield expire ,</l>
       <l n="3">Son of our Ulmen , didst thou mark no trace ,</l>
       <l n="4">In these sad looks , of a remembered face ?</l>
       <l n="5">Dost thou remember Izdabel ? Look here !</l>
       <l n="6">It is thy father 's hatchet and his spear .</l>
       <l n="7">Friend of my infant days , how I rejoice , 240</l>
       <l n="8">Lautaro cried , once more to hear that voice !</l>
       <l n="9">Life like a dream , since last we met , has fled —</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">I come to guide thee through untrodden ways ,</l>
       <l n="2">To the lone valley , where thy father 's days</l>
       <l n="3">Were passed ; where every cave and every tree ,</l>
       <l n="4">From morn to morn , reminded him of thee !</l>
       <l n="5">Lautaro cried : Here , faithful Indian , stay ;</l>
       <l n="6">I have a last sad duty yet to pay .</l>
       <l n="7">A little while we part :— thou here remain . 250</l>
       <l n="8">He spake , and passed like lightning o'er the plain .</l>
       <l n="9">Ah , cease , Castilian maid , thy vain alarms !</l>
       <l n="10">See where he comes — his father in his arms !</l>
       <l n="11">Now lead , he cried . The Indian , sad and still ,</l>
       <l n="12">Paced on from wood to vale , from vale to hill ;</l>
       <l n="13">Her infant tired , and hushed a while to rest ,</l>
       <l n="14">Smiled , in a dream , upon its mother 's breast ;</l>
       <l n="15">The pensive mother gray Anselmo led ;</l>
       <l n="16">Behind , Lautaro bore his father dead .</l>
       <l n="17">Beneath the branching palms they slept at night ; 260</l>
       <l n="18">The small birds waked them ere the morning light .</l>
       <l n="19">Before their path , in distant view , appeared</l>
       <l n="20">The mountain-smoke , that its dark column reared</l>
       <l n="21">O'er Andes ’ summits , in the pale blue sky ,</l>
       <l n="22">Lifting their icy pinnacles so high .</l>
       <l n="23">Four days they onward held their eastern way ;</l>
       <l n="24">On the fifth rising morn , before them lay</l>
       <l n="25">Chillan 's lone glen , amid whose windings green ,</l>
       <l n="26">The Warrior 's loved and last abode was seen .</l>
       <l n="27">No smoke went up , a stillness reigned around , 270</l>
       <l n="28">Save where the waters fell with soothing sound ,</l>
       <l n="29">Save where the Thenca sang so loud and clear ,</l>
       <l n="30">And the bright humming-bird was spinning near .</l>
       <l n="31">Yet here all human tumults seemed to cease ,</l>
       <l n="32">And sunshine rested on the spot of peace ;</l>
       <l n="33">The myrtles bloomed as fragrant and as green</l>
       <l n="34">As if Lautaro scarce had left the scene ;</l>
       <l n="35">And in his ear the falling waters ’ spray</l>
       <l n="36">Seemed swelling with the sounds of yesterday .</l>
       <l n="37">Where yonder rock the aged cedars shade , 280</l>
       <l n="38">There shall my father 's bones in peace be laid .</l>
       <l n="39">Beneath the cedar 's shade they dug the ground ;</l>
       <l n="40">The small and sad communion gathered round .</l>
       <l n="41">Beside the grave stood aged Izdabel ,</l>
       <l n="42">And broke the spear , and cried : Farewell , farewell !</l>
       <l n="43">Lautaro hid his face , and sighed Adieu !</l>
       <l n="44">As the stone hatchet in the grave he threw .</l>
       <l n="45">The little child that to its mother clung ,</l>
       <l n="46">Stretched out its arm , then on her garment hung ,</l>
       <l n="47">With sidelong looks , half-shrinking , half-amazed , 290</l>
       <l n="48">And dropped its flowers , unconscious , as it gazed .</l>
       <l n="49">And now Anselmo , his pale brow inclined ,</l>
       <l n="50">The honoured relics , dust to dust , consigned</l>
       <l n="51">With Christian rites , and sung , on bending knee ,</l>
       <l n="52">“ Eternam pacem dona , Domine . ”</l>
       <l n="53">Then rising up he closed the holy book ;</l>
       <l n="54">And lifting in the beam his lighted look ,</l>
       <l n="55">( The cross , with meekness , folded on his breast ) ,</l>
       <l n="56">Here , too , he cried , my bones in peace shall rest !</l>
       <l n="57">Few years remain to me , and never more 300</l>
       <l n="58">Shall I behold , O Spain ! thy distant shore !</l>
       <l n="59">Here lay my bones , that the same tree may wave</l>
       <l n="60">O'er the poor Christian 's and the Indian 's grave .</l>
       <l n="61">Oh , may it ( when the sons of future days</l>
       <l n="62">Shall hear our tale and on the hillock gaze ) ,</l>
       <l n="63">Oh , may it teach , that charity should bind ,</l>
       <l n="64">Where'er they roam , the brothers of mankind !</l>
       <l n="65">The time shall come , when wildest tribes shall hear</l>
       <l n="66">Thy voice , O Christ ! and drop the slaughtering spear .</l>
       <l n="67">Yet we condemn not him who bravely stood , 310</l>
       <l n="68">To seal his country 's freedom with his blood ;</l>
       <l n="69">And if , in after-times , a ruthless band</l>
       <l n="70">Of fell invaders sweep my native land ,</l>
       <l n="71">May she , by Chili 's stern example led ,</l>
       <l n="72">Hurl back his thunder on the assailant 's head ;</l>
       <l n="73">Sustained by Freedom , strike the avenging blow ,</l>
       <l n="74">And learn one virtue from her ancient foe !</l>
