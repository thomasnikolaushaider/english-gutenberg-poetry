    <docTitle><titlePart>ONCE on a time a Rev'rend Dean There lived , ( and you know whom I mean ,) Keen as a hawk each fault to seize , And Swift to blame , as slow to please ; Swell 'd up with pride to height of tumour , Though all admired his dogged humour . But since our Pompey knew not how To speak , as ‘ twere , but in ‘ bow wow ! ’ The Muse invites me to rehearse His constant bark in doggrel verse : Keen irony can n't hope to chime Without some small relief from rhyme , Though where you 'd feel the sharpest tingle , You lose the smart amidst the jingle ! Doubtless ( like Swift ) we 've now-a-days Both lords and ladies shy of praise , Of errors , ills , for ever mumbling , Yet love ‘ em for the sake of grumbling . Had Swift known how to hold his dish up , I 'm told he might have been a Bishop . I 've tried to make him look more recent , And dock 'd him where he 's quite indecent . On one thing you may quite rely ,— I am no busy , base Paul Pry . My best advices really flow From what I really ‘ happ'n ’ to know , Nor could escape in any wise , Save shutting both my ears and eyes . My book may sell , or fall dead flat ,— Yet MEADOWS makes me safe from that ; Since , to inspire , I 've given him some Of Master 's truly ‘ precious rum , ’ Deeming him best of all the bunch — But mum ! for what relates to ‘ PUNCH ! ’ And may each critic 's ‘ ifs and buts ’ But vie with his good-humoured cuts : For I profess the constant aim Of yielding ev'ry one I name ( Thus pleasing all , e'en to the letter ) Either a laugh — or something better . Now if I 've well explained my plan , Why , farewell Master ! farewell Man ! And free from fuss , I make no bones To sign , Yours thoroughly , JOHN JONES .</titlePart></docTitle>

    <head>THE BUTLER .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">OF servants , whether best or worst ,</l>
     <l n="2">The Butler seems to rank the first ;</l>
     <l n="3">Whose sparkling aid calls up the Nine ,—</l>
     <l n="4">Such virtue dwells in rosy wine .</l>
     <l n="5">There 's none can draw a cork like you ,</l>
     <l n="6">You 're such a perfect ‘ thorough screw . ’</l>
     <l n="7">Who else can keep within the tether</l>
     <l n="8">Mirth and economy together ?</l>
     <l n="9">At home for ever to a shaving ,</l>
     <l n="10">In all the honest arts of saving .</l>
     <l n="11">Since those who dine at the same table</l>
     <l n="12">Are friends , why should n't you be able</l>
     <l n="13">To make one glass , or two at most ,</l>
     <l n="14">Serve for both company and host ?</l>
     <l n="15">Thus saving both fatigue and breaking ,</l>
     <l n="16">And , most of all , the wine they 're taking .</l>
     <l n="17">Serve not one guest amidst the feast ,</l>
     <l n="18">Till he has call 'd three times at least ;</l>
     <l n="19">Further his temp'rance you may fix</l>
     <l n="20">By sundry nasty little tricks ,</l>
     <l n="21">More fit , because your own invention ,</l>
     <l n="22">For you to use than me to mention .</l>
     <l n="23">On your behaviour stands confest</l>
     <l n="24">The pain or ease of ev'ry guest ;</l>
     <l n="25">You can ensure a hearty greeting ,</l>
     <l n="26">Or make it like a Quakers ’ meeting .</l>
     <l n="27">From what your Master seems to do ,</l>
     <l n="28">You and the footmen take your cue ;</l>
     <l n="29">At least your Lady 'll teem with praise ,</l>
     <l n="30">You 've got such ‘ shrewd , discerning ways . ’</l>
     <l n="31">Should any one desire small beer ,</l>
     <l n="32">The end of dinner somewhat near ,</l>
     <l n="33">Gather the droppings ( exc'lent fun )</l>
     <l n="34">Of all the glasses into one .</l>
     <l n="35">This you may do and none perceive ,</l>
     <l n="36">“ The eye do n't see , the heart wo n't grieve : ”</l>
     <l n="37">Thus you may make a mighty chatter</l>
     <l n="38">Of saving in the smallest matter .</l>
     <l n="39">But when they chance to call for ale ,</l>
     <l n="40">More bright the joke more brisk the tale ,</l>
     <l n="41">Down to the vaults , and if not filling</l>
     <l n="42">The largest tankard till o'erspilling ,</l>
     <l n="43">Then you 're not fit to hold your station ,</l>
     <l n="44">Not fit to fill — your situation :</l>
     <l n="45">The company just drink two glasses ,</l>
     <l n="46">And you the rest amongst the lasses .</l>
     <l n="47">The same thing with respect to wine ;</l>
     <l n="48">It 's only just the whilst it 's fine</l>
     <l n="49">It suits our masters : good , i'fegs !</l>
     <l n="50">So half the bottle goes for dregs ;</l>
     <l n="51">Ha ! ha ! we 're then , instead of napping ,</l>
     <l n="52">Like the woodpecker ,— always ‘ tapping . ’</l>
     <l n="53">Of course , occasion'ly you tell o'er</l>
     <l n="54">The true contents of all the cellar .</l>
     <l n="55">Again of course , the choicest bottle</l>
     <l n="56">Scarce greets at all your Master 's throttle .</l>
     <l n="57">The deuce a bit ( if you 've the tact )</l>
     <l n="58">You care , if he suspects the fact ;</l>
     <l n="59">Then , to ensure his constant favour ,</l>
     <l n="60">Treat him , sometimes , for good behaviour !</l>
     <l n="61">Wipe knives , rub tables , clean your plate ,—</l>
     <l n="62">What can be more appropriate ?</l>
     <l n="63">With table-cloths : ‘ tis bold , and dashing ,</l>
     <l n="64">But saves in dusters and in washing .</l>
     <l n="65">In cleaning plate some talk of ‘ tricks , ’</l>
     <l n="66">Leaving the whiting in the nicks ;</l>
     <l n="67">The same with things in brass and copper :</l>
     <l n="68">But I contend it 's right and proper ;</l>
     <l n="69">Shows that you never kept aloof o n't ,</l>
     <l n="70">But did the thing — and left a proof o n't !</l>
     <l n="71">I know no writer yet that handles</l>
     <l n="72">The saving article of candles ;</l>
     <l n="73">But whilst convinc 'd how much depends</l>
     <l n="74">On ev'ry mortal 's private ‘ ends ’</l>
     <l n="75">The subject , I 'll not wholly doff it ,</l>
     <l n="76">It yields us all such glaring profit .</l>
     <l n="77">Nor light them soon nor burn them low ,</l>
     <l n="78">And part upon the Cook bestow ;</l>
     <l n="79">No wretch alive would be that despot ,</l>
     <l n="80">To go to rob the woman 's grease-pot !</l>
     <l n="81">Though some may say you rob their pockets ,</l>
     <l n="82">By what is wasted in the sockets :</l>
     <l n="83">A plague on all such meanness ! scout it ,</l>
     <l n="84">And never vex your sconce about it .</l>
     <l n="85">The noblest task in all your line ,</l>
     <l n="86">Is bottling off a PIPE OF WINE ;</l>
     <l n="87">Not that you drink wine from the vat ,</l>
     <l n="88">You know a ‘ trick worth two of that , ’</l>
     <l n="89">But that it makes you ( yet no stealer )</l>
     <l n="90">A reputable private dealer .</l>
     <l n="91">Choosing small bottles ,— no large lumber ,</l>
     <l n="92">Your Master gets his proper number ;</l>
     <l n="93">Whilst , mod'rate in your views of pelf ,</l>
     <l n="94">You get six dozen for yourself ,—</l>
     <l n="95">Nay , were your Master quite a miser ,</l>
     <l n="96">Pray ‘ who 's to be a bit the wiser ? ’</l>
     <l n="97">Make from the cask your brethren cosey ,</l>
     <l n="98">Of course not drunk , yet vastly dozy :</l>
     <l n="99">If fault be found you drain his wealth ,</l>
     <l n="100">‘ Twas all with ‘ drinking Master 's health . ’</l>
     <l n="101">Put ‘ em to bed to sleep it off ,</l>
     <l n="102">Say they 've a cold — a shocking cough ;</l>
     <l n="103">‘ Tis ten to one your Mistress orders</l>
     <l n="104">What you think good for all disorders ,</l>
     <l n="105">At which , before , you 've often laugh 'd ,—</l>
     <l n="106">A more and more composing draught !</l>
     <l n="107">Follow all guests towards the door ,</l>
     <l n="108">If they have slept a night or more ;</l>
     <l n="109">‘ Tis ten to one you 've half-a-crown ,—</l>
     <l n="110">Else ‘ show ‘ em up , ’ instead of down .</l>
     <l n="111">If they rebel and still resist ,</l>
     <l n="112">Get all the servants to assist ;</l>
     <l n="113">Whilst other plans you yet may try ,</l>
     <l n="114">As I shall show you by and by .</l>
     <l n="115">Good Butlers always break their corkscrew ,</l>
     <l n="116">So that it wo n't the lignum work through ,</l>
     <l n="117">Or do the job for which intended ,</l>
     <l n="118">Yet ne'er have time to get it mended :</l>
     <l n="119">The jovial service never balk ,</l>
     <l n="120">Perform it with a silver fork !</l>
     <l n="121">Now for the Gent who often dines ,</l>
     <l n="122">And eats your meat and drinks your wines ,</l>
     <l n="123">Yet gives no vails ,— torment him thence</l>
     <l n="124">‘ No end of ways ’ for the offence .</l>
     <l n="125">He calls , but you seem not to hear ;</l>
     <l n="126">If asking wine , present him beer ,</l>
     <l n="127">And , to prolong the pleasing strife ,</l>
     <l n="128">A spoon when he desires a knife .</l>
     <l n="129">At last he 'll do what fits his station ,—</l>
     <l n="130">Or never more get invitation .</l>
     <l n="131">Whoe'er comes in , whoe'er goes out ,</l>
     <l n="132">Your game is sure for ball or rout .</l>
     <l n="133">To fortune straight you 'll make your way ,</l>
     <l n="134">If once your Lady takes to play ;</l>
     <l n="135">It pays beyond all formal dinners ,</l>
     <l n="136">Only pay homage to the winners ,</l>
     <l n="137">Which I 'll be bound you always do ,</l>
     <l n="138">At least I would if I were you .</l>
     <l n="139">Now if I 've told you e'er a thumper ,</l>
     <l n="140">Fine me , when next we meet , a bumper :</l>
     <l n="141">Yes , give us truth without a sting ,</l>
     <l n="142">A bottle of the old ‘ BEE 'S WING . ’</l>

    <head>THE COOK .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">ALTHOUGH French Cooks be much too common ,—</l>
     <l n="2">I speak now to an English woman ,—</l>
     <l n="3">You would not wish to learn from books ,</l>
     <l n="4">How you might stock the pastry-cooks ,</l>
     <l n="5">And make my Lord pay carriage hence ,</l>
     <l n="6">For gimcracks made at his expense !</l>
     <l n="7">Although , quite fearless of detection ,</l>
     <l n="8">Some have ‘ arrived ’ at this perfection ;</l>
     <l n="9">And yet , I fear , I must conclude</l>
     <l n="10">There 's nothing of the kind in UDE ,</l>
     <l n="11">And therefore you must farther look ,</l>
     <l n="12">If wanting a “ Complete French Cook ! ”</l>
     <l n="13">Be with the Butler always ‘ friends , ’</l>
     <l n="14">And so make sure of both your ‘ ends . ’</l>
     <l n="15">When all the rest are safe in bed ,</l>
     <l n="16">As silent as if all were dead ,</l>
     <l n="17">You find the Butler dainty prog ,</l>
     <l n="18">Repaid as sure with luscious grog ;</l>
     <l n="19">But still , if you outrun your tether ,</l>
     <l n="20">‘ Tis odds you ‘ bundle ’ both together .</l>
     <l n="21">Avoid it ,— treat him like a brother ,</l>
     <l n="22">For you may ‘ never like another . ’</l>
     <l n="23">You can make friends with every one ,</l>
     <l n="24">So mind how my instructions run :</l>
     <l n="25">My lessons suit both town and country ,</l>
     <l n="26">If you 've the requisite effrontery .</l>
     <l n="27">Be sure to send up nothing ‘ cold , ’</l>
     <l n="28">Unless particularly ‘ told ; ’</l>
     <l n="29">Get rid of it to some dear crony ,</l>
     <l n="30">No matter whether fowl or coney .</l>
     <l n="31">If miss 'd , then lay it to the rats ,</l>
     <l n="32">Strange greyhounds or domestic cats :</l>
     <l n="33">( Poor things ! ‘ tis hard that you should scout ‘ em ,)</l>
     <l n="34">But harder still to do without ‘ em .</l>
     <l n="35">Then talk of ‘ magpies ’ for blue moons ,</l>
     <l n="36">When ‘ maids ’ run short of forks and spoons :</l>
     <l n="37">I must confess how I do glory ,</l>
     <l n="38">In that most true , most ‘ moving story . ’</l>
     <l n="39">If there 's no paper for your use</l>
     <l n="40">To light a fire or singe a goose ,</l>
     <l n="41">Swear by the poker , tongs , and shovel ,</l>
     <l n="42">You 'll tear some from the ‘ last new Novel . ’</l>
     <l n="43">If forc 'd to own that you 're the thief ,</l>
     <l n="44">Say you 'll “ turn over a new leaf : ”</l>
     <l n="45">Nay , should you rob ( no new proceeding )</l>
     <l n="46">The very work your Master 's reading ,</l>
     <l n="47">Say that ‘ there 's more besides the Cook , ’</l>
     <l n="48">Should take a “ leaf from Master 's book . ”</l>
     <l n="49">If you should serve a family</l>
     <l n="50">So rich , they do n't live crammily ,</l>
     <l n="51">Broils you may have — nay , constant broiling ,</l>
     <l n="52">Yet free from common roasting , boiling :</l>
     <l n="53">But stews and hashes bring much bother ,—</l>
     <l n="54">Encourage neither one nor t'other ;</l>
     <l n="55">Good Cooks still hate all diddle-daddle ,</l>
     <l n="56">Constant , eternal fiddle-faddle .</l>
     <l n="57">But snipes and larks , that come as presents</l>
     <l n="58">( Instead of partridges and pheasants )</l>
     <l n="59">Placed in the pan , ( a sort of toasting ,)</l>
     <l n="60">Will cook themselves , whatever 's roasting :</l>
     <l n="61">‘ Plague o n't ! ’ you wish the paltry elves</l>
     <l n="62">Would ‘ keep their presents to themselves . ’</l>
     <l n="63">And so for once I catch you tripping ,—</l>
     <l n="64">You long again for joints and dripping .</l>
     <l n="65">Would I be called on of a sudden</l>
     <l n="66">To make a plaguy ‘ sparra ’ pudden ? ’</l>
     <l n="67">I say at once , then , downright “ No !</l>
     <l n="68">I 'd see'em all at Jericho ! ”</l>
     <l n="69">And if they grumble , then give warning ,</l>
     <l n="70">‘ As sure as eggs is eggs , ’ next morning ;</l>
     <l n="71">And beg they 'd please , in lieu of more freaks ,</l>
     <l n="72">To “ suit themselves as that day four weeks . ”</l>
     <l n="73">Who cares for their ‘ contempshus looks , ’</l>
     <l n="74">Their “ God sends meat , the devil cooks ; ”</l>
     <l n="75">They 're only better sort of ‘ varments , ’</l>
     <l n="76">I says , “ good Masters makes good Sarvants . ”</l>
     <l n="77">If you 're allow 'd the kitchen stuff ,</l>
     <l n="78">Be sure the meat 's done quite enough ;</l>
     <l n="79">But if your Mistress ‘ claps her paw , ’</l>
     <l n="80">Then serve it up downright ‘ red raw . ’</l>
     <l n="81">If fault be found , though , ‘ aither way , ’</l>
     <l n="82">“ It sha n't be so another day ; ”</l>
     <l n="83">And still , against each new desire ,</l>
     <l n="84">Keep up a brisk and roaring fire .</l>
     <l n="85">Let red hot coals the dripping savour ,</l>
     <l n="86">To give the meat a ‘ foreign flavour ; ’</l>
     <l n="87">And say , whatever falls upon it ,</l>
     <l n="88">“ The more there 's i n't , the more there 's on it . ”</l>
     <l n="89">When ‘ all behind , ’ and time the winner ,</l>
     <l n="90">‘ Regarding sending up the dinner , ’</l>
     <l n="91">Alter the clock when you begin it ,</l>
     <l n="92">And you 'll be ready to a minute .</l>
     <l n="93">One secret now I 'll not conceal ,—</l>
     <l n="94">Whene'er you roast a breast of veal ,</l>
     <l n="95">The sweetbread is the Butler 's luncheon ,</l>
     <l n="96">Whoever may go short of munching .</l>
     <l n="97">If it be ‘ asked for , ’ make excuses</l>
     <l n="98">For what so many sweets produces ;</l>
     <l n="99">Yet , O beware , his faith to prove ,</l>
     <l n="100">Beware , beware of cupboard love !</l>
     <l n="101">Sops in the pan but feed desire ,</l>
     <l n="102">Till “ all the fat is in the fire : ”</l>
     <l n="103">In Freedom 's cause both risk your peace</l>
     <l n="104">And , Byron-like ,— expire in GREASE !</l>

    <head>THE VALET .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">MY author is not merely blameful</l>
     <l n="2">To leave you out — ‘ tis downright shameful !</l>
     <l n="3">Affording you no condescension ,</l>
     <l n="4">Beyond an incidental mention ;</l>
     <l n="5">Since none like you , one must suppose ,</l>
     <l n="6">Can take a noble by the nose ;</l>
     <l n="7">Whilst lofty thoughts you well may harbour ,</l>
     <l n="8">Having been always ‘ quite the barber : ’</l>
     <l n="9">And rising thus , with perfect ease ,</l>
     <l n="10">To almost any thing you please .</l>
     <l n="11">If you 're with some good-natured Duke ,</l>
     <l n="12">Why , free of course from coarse rebuke ,</l>
     <l n="13">You take upon , and call about you ,</l>
     <l n="14">Knowing he can n't get on without you ;</l>
     <l n="15">So clever keeping out the duns ,</l>
     <l n="16">And ushering the ‘ priests and nuns ! ’</l>
     <l n="17">‘ Airs ’ may not suit his ‘ Grace 's ’ whim ,</l>
     <l n="18">And so you lord it over him !</l>
     <l n="19">If friends remonstrate , he will say ,</l>
     <l n="20">“ I fancy it 's the rascal 's way . ”</l>
     <l n="21">If he be deaf , you 'll keep him under</l>
     <l n="22">By making signs , else let him wonder :</l>
     <l n="23">If dim of sight , still all the better ,</l>
     <l n="24">You 'll more than peep in every letter ;</l>
     <l n="25">Nor will it be by you denied ,</l>
     <l n="26">Most Lords have more than one ‘ blind side . ’</l>
     <l n="27">To some good tune you 've owned this blessing ,</l>
     <l n="28">Whilst idolized for taste in dressing ,</l>
     <l n="29">Since the whole wardrobe 's varied range</l>
     <l n="30">Is yours , by turns , to ‘ sell or change ! ’</l>
     <l n="31">Urged by the winning approbation</l>
     <l n="32">Or of a Solomons or Nathan ,</l>
     <l n="33">You can estrange each ‘ chosen ’ waistcoat ,</l>
     <l n="34">And alienate his dearest dress-coat !</l>
     <l n="35">Or , by the use of ‘ fitting ’ phrases ,</l>
     <l n="36">Stock half the shops with ‘ misfit ’ jaseys .</l>
     <l n="37">You ‘ try it on : ’ howe'er becoming ,</l>
     <l n="38">If you begin just ‘ ha-ing , humming , ’</l>
     <l n="39">It puts him straight in such a fume ,</l>
     <l n="40">He kicks it up and down the room ;</l>
     <l n="41">Though you 've “ no wish to seem capricious ,</l>
     <l n="42">There 's something in it not judicious . ”</l>
     <l n="43">Then for new suits you feel his pulse ,</l>
     <l n="44">The measure answers ,— “ Send for Stultz ! ”</l>
     <l n="45">“ Our stock of boots is far from nobby : ”</l>
     <l n="46">“ Well ! where the d —— l , sir , is Hoby ? ”</l>
     <l n="47">Get but the measure of his foot ,</l>
     <l n="48">You 've clothes , wigs , jewels , all ‘ to boot ! ’</l>
     <l n="49">The more you crave the more he 's Frank for't ,</l>
     <l n="50">Though chiefly you 've yourself to thank for't .</l>
     <l n="51">Thus whilst whole cargoes you command ,</l>
     <l n="52">At once as ‘ good as ’ second-hand ,</l>
     <l n="53">Yet ( on the other hand ) ‘ tis true ,</l>
     <l n="54">They 're ‘ not inferior ’ to new .</l>
     <l n="55">Sweet interchange ! yourself so fervent ,</l>
     <l n="56">A sample of the ‘ perfect servant ; ’</l>
     <l n="57">Without one wish to take it ‘ cooler , ’</l>
     <l n="58">Having so ‘ Exquisite ’ a ruler !</l>
     <l n="59">If vastly nice in his amours ,</l>
     <l n="60">Still all goes nicely on all fours .</l>
     <l n="61">Large though your meed for nice attention ,</l>
     <l n="62">The gross amount one need not mention ;</l>
     <l n="63">Prove that he made you once a present ,</l>
     <l n="64">And help yourself all nice and pleasant !</l>
     <l n="65">Good Judges will applaud the fun ,</l>
     <l n="66">And own the thing was nicely done .</l>
     <l n="67">Now , as your mind acquires expansion ,</l>
     <l n="68">You 'll build yourself a tidy mansion ;</l>
     <l n="69">The tradesmen freely will afford ,—</l>
     <l n="70">By way of samples for your Lord ,</l>
     <l n="71">( Your delicacy not to shock it ,)</l>
     <l n="72">Both prog and furniture to stock it .</l>
     <l n="73">Thus some opine some odd disaster ,</l>
     <l n="74">So blends the Servant with the Master ,</l>
     <l n="75">That they might doubt , amidst the pother ,</l>
     <l n="76">Whether they dined with one or t'other !</l>
     <l n="77">Allow me now the leave to ask you ,—</l>
     <l n="78">Supposing I 'd the right to task you ,—</l>
     <l n="79">Would you be Clergyman or Doctor ,</l>
     <l n="80">Attorney , Barrister , or Proctor ?</l>
     <l n="81">Be famed in arms , or shine in arts ,</l>
     <l n="82">Upon the whole a man of parts</l>
     <l n="83">Rais 'd to high fortune by the palette ?</l>
     <l n="84">Before them all — a ‘ lying Valet ! ’</l>
     <l n="85">Joking apart , here be some traces ,</l>
     <l n="86">Of what are called ‘ good Valets ’ places . ’</l>
     <l n="87">And now , if these be fitting words</l>
     <l n="88">Pertaining but to Dukes and Lords ,</l>
     <l n="89">How shall the Muse presume to sing</l>
     <l n="90">Of those who serve a Prince or King ?</l>
     <l n="91">Sweet goddess ! bring th ’ event about ,</l>
     <l n="92">And ‘ place ’ thy ‘ servants ’ out of doubt !</l>
     <l n="93">We 'll say you may n't have had the gumption</l>
     <l n="94">To make this galloping consumption</l>
     <l n="95">Of half his wealth , without a rumpus ,—</l>
     <l n="96">Or say a quarter ( within compass ) ;</l>
     <l n="97">Still as to have , you 've still been known ,</l>
     <l n="98">The devil 's luck besides your own ,</l>
     <l n="99">The King or Prince a visit pays</l>
     <l n="100">To your grandee for some few days .</l>
     <l n="101">You 're introduced , somehow or other ,</l>
     <l n="102">And ‘ somehow ’ set aside your brother ,</l>
     <l n="103">Who , e'en unsafe in his own skin ,</l>
     <l n="104">Forced to jump out ,— why you jump in !</l>
     <l n="105">All your ‘ attentions ’ are so striking ,</l>
     <l n="106">At once they catch the royal liking .</l>
     <l n="107">Your Master feigns a ‘ deep regret , ’</l>
     <l n="108">Well knowing what himself shall get :</l>
     <l n="109">You ( bless your stars for such a barter )</l>
     <l n="110">Are bought and paid for with — the GARTER !</l>
     <l n="111">And having got just what you wish 'd for ,</l>
     <l n="112">No secret make of what you fish 'd for .</l>
     <l n="113">Fortune can go but one step higher ,</l>
     <l n="114">You 're made a Page , and dubb 'd Esquire ;</l>
     <l n="115">And then you 'll turn upon your heel ,</l>
     <l n="116">Prouder than Wellington or Peel ,</l>
     <l n="117">Since you yourself can hardly know</l>
     <l n="118">How far your influence may go .</l>
     <l n="119">And now your almost only care ,</l>
     <l n="120">Amidst the all-attractive glare ,</l>
     <l n="121">Is to ward off all applications</l>
     <l n="122">From seedy friends and poor relations ;</l>
     <l n="123">While you 've no end of fun and sport</l>
     <l n="124">When clumsy people come to Court .</l>
     <l n="125">The King will do whate'er you crave him ,</l>
     <l n="126">If you 'll but just agree to ‘ shave him ; ’</l>
     <l n="127">Which you most certainly will do</l>
     <l n="128">More ways than one , and closely too !</l>

     <l n="3">As now-a-days old clothes to barter</l>
     <l n="4">For china , trinkets , scented water ,</l>
     <l n="5">Or use them up for chairs and screens ,</l>
     <l n="6">Less'ning an honest servant 's means ;</l>

     <l n="8">The prevalence of locks and keys !</l>
     <l n="9">Making you live , all hugger-mugger ,</l>
     <l n="10">On bohea slops and coarse brown sugar .</l>
     <l n="11">There 's yet another ‘ plaguy way , ’</l>

     <l n="18">May like you better than his Lady ,</l>
     <l n="19">Though she 's an angel ,— vastly stupid !</l>
     <l n="20">But that 's a freak of Master Cupid ,</l>

     <l n="125">You drop the note ; your Lady 'll find it ,</l>
     <l n="126">Is angry ,— deuce a bit you mind it .</l>
     <l n="127">Then swear , to make the joke the better ,</l>
     <l n="128">You never knew you had the letter ;</l>

     <l n="137">Nay , howsoe'er she seem to frown ,</l>

     <l n="139">Follow this rig with each fresh man ,</l>
     <l n="140">As often as you safely can ;</l>

     <l n="142">More and more handsome than the rest .</l>
     <l n="143">Indignant seem , if you detect</l>

     <l n="75">That brother flunkeys die with spite ,</l>

     <l n="77">For why ? ‘ a fav'rite has no friend ! ’</l>
     <l n="78">The reason 's plain why so abusive ,</l>
     <l n="79">All hate an out-and-out exclusive !</l>
     <l n="80">When on a message you are sent ,</l>
     <l n="81">( On your own whim more strictly bent ,)</l>

     <l n="110">Where , for the present , while we leave them ,</l>
     <l n="111">May no curst tell-tale undeceive them !</l>
     <l n="112">To be in lodgings when your lot ,</l>
     <l n="113">And there 's no shoe-boy to be got ,</l>
     <l n="114">You 'll clean your Master 's , without hurting</l>
     <l n="115">At all — the bottom of the curtain ;</l>
     <l n="116">Or , if you have the exceeding nerve ,</l>
     <l n="117">Your Lady 's apron then may serve .</l>
     <l n="118">Scrape not your own , like vulgar mortals ,</l>
     <l n="119">Standing outside your Master 's portals ;</l>
     <l n="120">But of your cleanliness to vapour ,</l>
     <l n="121">Use the hearth-rug , and save the scraper !</l>
     <l n="122">Ask not for leave each rambling bout ,</l>
     <l n="123">The less your fear to be found ‘ out ; ’</l>
     <l n="124">Though p'raps you 've had a bout of kissing ,</l>
     <l n="125">And no one knows you 've e'er been missing :</l>
     <l n="126">All that your fellow-servants know ,</l>

     <l n="128">Snuff candles with your fingers ’ ends ;</l>
     <l n="129">And for the stench to make amends ,</l>
     <l n="130">Think that your Master scarcely suffers</l>
     <l n="131">The least expense for polished snuffers ;</l>
     <l n="132">Throw down the snuff upon the floor ,</l>
     <l n="133">And what can man , or Footman , more ?</l>
     <l n="134">It quite an easy thing to scoff is ,</l>
     <l n="135">But candle-snuffing 's quite an office !</l>
     <l n="136">Contrive it , when you know you 're wanted ,</l>
     <l n="137">To shun the room as if ‘ twere haunted ;</l>
     <l n="138">But when there 's private conversation ,</l>
     <l n="139">Rush in , a downright congregation !</l>
     <l n="140">If left unchid , then all is well ;</l>
     <l n="141">If not , then swear you heard the bell .</l>
     <l n="142">Secrets that ‘ drop ’ from gents and ladies ,</l>
     <l n="143">The best of all your stock in trade is ;</l>
     <l n="144">While you , a course more cautious steering ,</l>
     <l n="145">Let nothing ‘ fall ’ within their hearing .</l>
     <l n="146">Indiff'rent still to praise or blame ,</l>
     <l n="147">You soar above the sense of shame .</l>
     <l n="148">“ The tea is good , the coffee ai n't ; ”</l>
     <l n="149">Then give ‘ em ‘ grounds ’ for the complaint .</l>
     <l n="150">No matter if the pot boils over ,</l>
     <l n="151">Come what come may , you 're still in clover :</l>
     <l n="152">Swear you took pains , ‘ more than a little , ’</l>
     <l n="153">To please their palates to a tittle .</l>
     <l n="154">The march of blame begins to halt ,</l>
     <l n="155">They pardon beg for finding fault ,</l>
     <l n="156">And “ ne'er again will blame in haste ,</l>
     <l n="157">But all their mouths were out of taste ! ”</l>
     <l n="158">Thus you 're repaid for all your trouble ,</l>
     <l n="159">Enjoy the ‘ squeak , ’ nor burst the ‘ bubble . ’</l>
     <l n="160">You cry , “ Enough , then , for the present ; ”</l>
     <l n="161">Yet list to something still more pleasant .</l>
     <l n="162">I 'll tell you how , if you 're but willing ,</l>
     <l n="163">From deepest fob t ’ extract a shilling .</l>
     <l n="164">A present when desired to carry ,</l>
     <l n="165">If but a sorry pumpkin ,— marry ,</l>
     <l n="166">Make as much fuss ( or even greater )</l>
     <l n="167">Than if it were a gold repeater ;</l>
     <l n="168">Send up your Master 's strict commands</l>
     <l n="169">To give it safe with your own hands .</l>
     <l n="170">This to the purse-strings gives a shock ,</l>
     <l n="171">They can n't but find out what 's o'clock :</l>
     <l n="172">In other words , they 're wide awake ,</l>
     <l n="173">The money 's yours , and no mistake !</l>
     <l n="174">When your own Master gets the like ,</l>
     <l n="175">A brace of barbel , bream , or pike ,</l>
     <l n="176">Stir up his generosity</l>
     <l n="177">To tip your friend a double fee ;</l>
     <l n="178">Go snacks then with your liveried brother ,</l>

     <l n="187">Or Master 's nerves the slightest shocking :</l>

     <l n="189">Or swear black 's white ,— you 've ne'er been absent ;</l>
     <l n="190">Or , of belief to take a fresh hold ,</l>
     <l n="191">No , “ never stirr 'd from off the threshold ! ”</l>

     <l n="198">Share in their woes , it ne'er can fail ;</l>

     <l n="1">YOU 'VE more importance than the Housemaid ,</l>
     <l n="2">As living where there 's greater fuss made ,—</l>
     <l n="3">A vastly more important clatter</l>
     <l n="4">Than where they only keep the latter .</l>
     <l n="5">You 've nought to do but “ up stairs clamber ,</l>
     <l n="6">Down stairs , and in my lady 's chamber ; ”</l>
     <l n="7">Take vails of all the visitors ,</l>
     <l n="8">And chat with all inquisitors ;</l>
     <l n="9">And whilst a secret 's left remaining ,</l>
     <l n="10">You 're always vastly entertaining .</l>

     <l n="12">Till you can coax the Footman over ;</l>
     <l n="13">Who sometimes helps you in fatigue ,</l>
     <l n="14">But always in a nice intrigue .</l>
     <l n="15">The worst mishap that comes to pass</l>
     <l n="16">Is when you break a looking-glass ;</l>
     <l n="17">For could invention stretch like leather ,</l>
     <l n="18">You ne'er can ‘ jine the bits together . ’</l>
     <l n="19">But still excuses may be had ,—</l>
     <l n="20">I 'll tell you one that ‘ sha n't be bad ; ’</l>
     <l n="21">The girl , you 'll say , deserved a pension ,</l>
     <l n="22">Although it failed , for the invention .</l>
     <l n="23">The glass she smashes all to shivers ,</l>
     <l n="24">And frets and fumes , and quakes and quivers</l>
     <l n="25">To think — whichever way to view it —</l>
     <l n="26">How in the world should she ‘ git through it . ’</l>
     <l n="27">Th ’ emergency was sudden , dreadful ,</l>
     <l n="28">And needed brains more than a headfull :</l>
     <l n="29">‘ Howsever , ’ calling up her wits ,</l>
     <l n="30">( Instead of falling into fits ,)</l>
     <l n="31">She lock 'd the door ; then fetch 'd up straight</l>
     <l n="32">A stone of half-a-hundred weight ,</l>
     <l n="33">Quick as if followed by Old Scratch ,</l>
     <l n="34">And breaks a pane of glass ‘ to match . ’</l>
     <l n="35">The stone laid down beneath the shelf ,</l>
     <l n="36">( More softly than if down itself ,)</l>
     <l n="37">She goes , with just her general airs ,</l>
     <l n="38">About her general affairs .</l>
     <l n="39">It takes — precisely as she wish 'd ;</l>
     <l n="40">And yet at last the poor girl 's dish 'd .</l>
     <l n="41">When all seemed well ,— at least quite fairish ,</l>
     <l n="42">In pops the Parson of the parish ,—</l>
     <l n="43">Talks of the height , the situation ,</l>
     <l n="44">The weight , the laws of gravitation ;</l>
     <l n="45">Prates law like any Romilly ,</l>
     <l n="46">And ends with a fine homily ;</l>
     <l n="47">Until , at last , I grieve to say ,</l>

     <l n="49">Still ‘ tis not oft that female tactics</l>
     <l n="50">Are set aside by mathematics ;</l>
     <l n="51">Nor left to busy-bodies whether</l>
     <l n="52">A story fails or hangs together .</l>
     <l n="53">So then , as Kitchener would say ,</l>
     <l n="54">“ To devil it a diff'rent way , ”</l>
     <l n="55">Swear that , amidst a strange perfume ,</l>
     <l n="56">( Like brimstone , filling all the room ,)</l>
     <l n="57">You felt a flash of lightning burn you ,</l>
     <l n="58">And then , before you 'd time to turn you ,</l>
     <l n="59">Or wake at all from the surprise ,</l>
     <l n="60">You 'd lost the use of both your eyes !</l>
     <l n="61">And in that state , midst horrid clatters ,</l>
     <l n="62">Saw the glass lying all in shatters .</l>
     <l n="63">‘ Another way : ’ — it wanted dusting ,</l>
     <l n="64">And you to set it right were bursting ;</l>
     <l n="65">When lo ! the moisture of the ‘ hair ’</l>
     <l n="66">Had left the plate completely bare ,</l>
     <l n="67">So that it parted from the wall</l>
     <l n="68">Without the ‘ leastest ’ touch at all .</l>
     <l n="69">And that 's — though they may think it lame —</l>
     <l n="70">The best excuse that you can frame .</l>
     <l n="71">I can n't invent but one more bolsterer ,—</l>
     <l n="72">To cut the cord , and curse th ’ upholsterer :</l>
     <l n="73">But for a thumping taradiddle ,</l>
     <l n="74">To no one e'er play second fiddle .</l>
     <l n="75">Now , as for little trifling matters ,</l>
     <l n="76">As breaking ‘ chayney ’ cups and platters ,</l>
     <l n="77">Or letting a large punch-bowl fall ,—</l>
     <l n="78">Why never vex yourself at all .</l>
     <l n="79">“ You 're not surpris 'd , since it appears</l>
     <l n="80">As it 's been crack 'd for years and years ;</l>
     <l n="81">And as you took it off the shelf ,</l>
     <l n="82">It came in ‘ three halves ’ quite itself :</l>
     <l n="83">It 's no use going into fits ,</l>
     <l n="84">To prove the fact — you 've saved the bits ! ”</l>
     <l n="85">Lying is , doubtless , half the trade</l>
     <l n="86">Of ev'ry clever Chambermaid ;</l>
     <l n="87">Though yet it seems the chiefest sleight</l>

     <l n="14">But what I 'd show my gratitude !</l>
     <l n="15">Say that “ Miss Laura 's too precocious ;</l>
     <l n="16">Jane so inert , Ruth so ferocious ,</l>
     <l n="17">Rose quite an invalid ; Miss Liddy</l>
     <l n="18">So most abominably giddy ,—</l>
     <l n="19">You can make nothing — maugre raillery ,</l>
     <l n="20">Of any of ‘ em but — the salary ! ”</l>

    <head>A FEW RULES ,</head>
    <head>WHICH CONCERN ALL SERVANTS IN GENERAL .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">WHO comes when called for , all agree ,</l>
     <l n="2">Is ‘ servant ’ good as good can be ;</l>
     <l n="3">Therefore , to save a deal of bother ,</l>
     <l n="4">Speak for yourself , and for no other .</l>
     <l n="5">To put your Masters off their mettle ,</l>
     <l n="6">And all disputes the sooner settle ,</l>
     <l n="7">The only way is not to ‘ bend , ’</l>
     <l n="8">But ‘ give as good as they can send . ’</l>
     <l n="9">Never tell tales of one another ,</l>
     <l n="10">Except of some too favoured brother ;</l>
     <l n="11">But there it seems a rule confest</l>
     <l n="12">To heap the faults of all the rest :</l>
     <l n="13">I quite agree with Mister Gray ,</l>
     <l n="14">To get all favourites ‘ turn 'd away . ’</l>
     <l n="15">Bribe little masters and young misses</l>
     <l n="16">With sugar-plums and slobb'ring kisses .</l>
     <l n="17">Thus they will say , “ How good you are ! ”</l>
     <l n="18">And tell no tales to Pa or Mar .</l>
     <l n="19">Let every servant feel as great ,</l>
     <l n="20">As if his Master 's whole estate</l>
     <l n="21">Were meant to furnish prog and pelf</l>
     <l n="22">But for his individual self .</l>
     <l n="23">The Cook , for instance , thinks it queer</l>
     <l n="24">If twenty thousand pounds a-year</l>
     <l n="25">Wo n't make the household richly dine ,—</l>
     <l n="26">And so the Butler thinks of wine .</l>
     <l n="27">Groom , Coachman , all the rest ‘ run on , ’</l>
     <l n="28">Till sometimes all the money 's gone .</l>
     <l n="29">“ Fortune 's a jilt , ” and “ plague upon her ! ”</l>
     <l n="30">You did it all for “ Master 's honour ! ”</l>
     <l n="31">And though yourselves alone have brought it ,</l>
     <l n="32">You 're first to cry out “ Who 'd ha ’ thought it ? ”</l>
     <l n="33">Yet this may caution some on entry ,</l>
     <l n="34">Not to set up too soon for gentry .</l>
     <l n="35">When upon errands you are sent ,</l>
     <l n="36">( On something else , of course , intent )</l>
     <l n="37">And absent more than half the day ,</l>
     <l n="38">Come back ‘ not knowing what to say ; ’</l>
     <l n="39">Then is the time you 'll see the uses</l>
     <l n="40">Of a whole set of ‘ good excuses : ’</l>
     <l n="41">“ A near relation came a distance ,</l>
     <l n="42">And really needing your assistance ,—</l>
     <l n="43">An uncle whom you 'd never seen</l>
     <l n="44">From ‘ such times ’ you were seventeen ,</l>
     <l n="45">And all that you could raise ( alack ! )</l>
     <l n="46">Was scarce enough to take him back . ” —</l>
     <l n="47">“ Some one , to whom you 'd money lent ,</l>
     <l n="48">Was making for the Continent . ” —</l>
     <l n="49">Make out a story ,— cram it full :</l>
     <l n="50">The cock wo n't fight ?— then try the bull .</l>
     <l n="51">“ A ‘ peeler ’ had the nation gnous</l>
     <l n="52">To clap you in the station-house ,</l>
     <l n="53">Where you were ‘ kep ’ the morning ‘ through , ’</l>
     <l n="54">Quite ignorant of what to do ,</l>
     <l n="55">Although you 'd rather lie in jail ,</l>
     <l n="56">Than ask his honour to stand bail ;</l>
     <l n="57">And all because ( though past belief )</l>
     <l n="58">You bore some likeness to a thief !</l>
     <l n="59">A fifth , ‘ more betterer ’ than all ,</l>
     <l n="60">Was shipping off ‘ towards Bengal . ’</l>
     <l n="61">“ You went to try to use your tongue ,</l>
     <l n="62">To save a friend from being hung ;</l>
     <l n="63">You wrench 'd your foot ‘ aginst a stone , ’</l>
     <l n="64">And ‘ laid ’ your ancle to the bone ;</l>
     <l n="65">Which gave you such a horrid ‘ feel , ’</l>
     <l n="66">The Doctor thinks ‘ twill never heal .</l>
     <l n="67">But still you must submit to fate ,</l>
     <l n="68">And hope you 're not a deal — too late . ”</l>
     <l n="69">Yet if , not mending much the case ,</l>
     <l n="70">You swear till near ‘ black in the face ; ’</l>
     <l n="71">If each fresh story they despise ,</l>
     <l n="72">Though doing all that in you lies ;</l>
     <l n="73">Confess , and say from earliest youth</l>
     <l n="74">You 've thought it “ best to tell the truth . ”</l>
     <l n="75">Amongst the rest of my advices ,</l>
     <l n="76">Defend all tradesmen ‘ as to prices : ’</l>
     <l n="77">The very thought of an abatement</l>
     <l n="78">Was for the little , not the great meant .</l>
     <l n="79">And who 'd oppose a little tricking ,</l>
     <l n="80">Which brings yourself a deal of picking ?</l>
     <l n="81">And where ,— to use an honest course ,</l>
     <l n="82">The saddle 's put on the right horse ?</l>
     <l n="83">Keep , then , those shopkeepers in view ,</l>
     <l n="84">Who 'll more than wink at all you do ;—</l>
     <l n="85">In short , trust no one ( to save trouble ) ,</l>
     <l n="86">That wo n't make out a bill for double .</l>
     <l n="87">Mind nothing but your own affairs ,</l>
     <l n="88">And let the rest attend to theirs .</l>
     <l n="89">Thus if , for instance , you are told</l>
     <l n="90">To shut the stable-door : make bold</l>
     <l n="91">To say ( for that your only course is ) ,</l>
     <l n="92">You “ war n't brought up at all to horses . ”</l>
     <l n="93">The Footman 's ask 'd to drive a nail ,</l>
     <l n="94">And must adopt a sim'lar tale ;</l>
     <l n="95">He “ can n't in such a bus'ness stir ,</l>
     <l n="96">But Tom can fetch th ’ upholsterer ! ”</l>
     <l n="97">To put out candles there are ways</l>
     <l n="98">Demanding more than common praise .</l>
     <l n="99">Some of you make no ‘ bones ’ at all</l>
     <l n="100">Of dabbing it against the wall ;</l>
     <l n="101">Some twirl it round , and round , and round ;</l>
     <l n="102">Some tread it out upon the ground :</l>
     <l n="103">Others will give the spark release ,</l>
     <l n="104">By drowning it in its own grease !</l>
     <l n="105">But being mostly done in haste ,</l>
     <l n="106">Much must depend on your own taste ;</l>
     <l n="107">Only remember , aught prefer</l>
     <l n="108">To a downright extinguisher !</l>
     <l n="109">But candles , still , I 've not quite done with ,</l>
     <l n="110">They 're things to make such store of fun with .</l>
     <l n="111">‘ Put out the light , ’ and still there 's room</l>
     <l n="112">Its ‘ former ’ twinklings to ‘ relume . ’</l>
     <l n="113">If once they 're lighted , that 's enough ,—</l>
     <l n="114">All that is ‘ left ’ is kitchen-stuff :</l>
     <l n="115">But do not ( never for your soul )</l>
     <l n="116">‘ Go for to ’ cut up candles whole !</l>
     <l n="117">I knew a girl who cut her sticks ,</l>
     <l n="118">Because the chandler smoked the wicks ,</l>
     <l n="119">Convinced there must be something rotten</l>
     <l n="120">With such a deuced heap of cotton :</l>
     <l n="121">It did n't ( ‘ nor ought it to ’ ) succeed ,</l>
     <l n="122">Being a truly wicked deed !</l>
     <l n="123">Write both your own and sweetheart 's names</l>
     <l n="124">( To show the height of both your flames ,</l>
     <l n="125">Your love and learning both revealing )</l>
     <l n="126">With candle-smoke upon the ceiling ,</l>
     <l n="127">And never mind whoever laughs ,—</l>
     <l n="128">They 're extra ‘ curious autographs ! ’</l>
     <l n="129">To shut or open doors if loath ,</l>
     <l n="130">( And who 'd be bother 'd to do both ? )</l>
     <l n="131">To keep from quarrels about either ,</l>
     <l n="132">The shortest way is to do neither .</l>
     <l n="133">But if the ‘ shutting ’ ( quite a poser )</l>
     <l n="134">Brings a command , that 's quite a closer :</l>
     <l n="135">Do it , to cause their special wonder ,</l>
     <l n="136">To vie with any clap of thunder !</l>
     <l n="137">Thus while you prove you know your trade ,</l>
     <l n="138">They 'll be convinced that they 're obeyed .</l>
     <l n="139">Indulge yourself in bouncing airs ,</l>
     <l n="140">Go , mutt'ring all the way down stairs ,—</l>
     <l n="141">“ They 're people that you will not stop with ; ”</l>
     <l n="142">It 's “ rayther more than you 'll put up with . ”</l>
     <l n="143">If you find out they somehow like you ,</l>
     <l n="144">One thought will naturally strike you ;</l>
     <l n="145">Give warning — instantly , and say</l>
     <l n="146">Your work is hard , with slender pay ;</l>
     <l n="147">You really must have some advance ,</l>
     <l n="148">“ Service is no inheritance . ”</l>
     <l n="149">If they be not awake , the sages</l>
     <l n="150">Will ‘ bate your work and raise your wages :</l>
     <l n="151">But if you 're balk 'd , and time runs on ,</l>
     <l n="152">Inquiry 's made why you 're not gone ?</l>
     <l n="153">Your fellow-servants , you explain ,</l>
     <l n="154">Prevail 'd on you to ‘ stop again . ’</l>
     <l n="155">But when you do go ( you 're the judge</l>
     <l n="156">Whether it 's worth your while to budge ) ,</l>
     <l n="157">Say “ You have left so vile a race ,</l>
     <l n="158">That none will venture on the place . ”</l>
     <l n="159">Now take an honest friend 's advice ,—</l>
     <l n="160">Answer , when call 'd not less than thrice ;</l>
     <l n="161">“ Dogs only come at the first whistle , ”</l>
     <l n="162">And then in hopes of bone or gristle .</l>
     <l n="163">“ Who 's there ? ” when some wiseacres call ,</l>
     <l n="164">Who 's there ? is no one 's name at all :</l>
     <l n="165">Keep quiet ; let ‘ em ‘ make a page ’</l>
     <l n="166">One of exactly ‘ their own age , ’</l>
     <l n="167">And when you 're found , the helpless elves</l>
     <l n="168">Have done the mighty job themselves .</l>
     <l n="169">Whate'er you do , abhor a tell-tale ,</l>
     <l n="170">In all things else you scarce can well fail ;</l>
     <l n="171">But when a servant turns his back ,</l>
     <l n="172">Then all at once be at him smack ,</l>
     <l n="173">And ev'ry fault the rest have done</l>
     <l n="174">Ascribe to him , when once he 's gone .</l>
     <l n="175">First , then , ( though you are no detractor ,)</l>
     <l n="176">“ He got in with a false character ;</l>
     <l n="177">He was ungrateful ,— oh , most horrid !</l>
     <l n="178">Deceit itself ‘ rit in his forrid , ’</l>
     <l n="179">And one ‘ more wastefuller ’ of store ,</l>
     <l n="180">‘ Never set foot into a door ; ’</l>
     <l n="181">‘ Twas him that spoilt the street-door lock ,</l>
     <l n="182">‘ Twas him that broke the parlour clock ,</l>
     <l n="183">That did whatever he might please ,</l>
     <l n="184">That had a ‘ perfect set of keys ! ’</l>
     <l n="185">That nothing ‘ went ’ but he receiv 'd it ,</l>
     <l n="186">And ‘ shipp 'd it off ’ when once he 'd thiev 'd it . ”</l>
     <l n="187">If ask 'd ( which must be quite a bore ) ,</l>
     <l n="188">“ Pray why not tell all this before ? ”</l>
     <l n="189">Say that you thought it most judicious</l>
     <l n="190">Not to appear “ the least malicious : ”</l>
     <l n="191">And when you 're tired of blaming flunkey ,</l>
     <l n="192">Comes lap-dog , parrot , cat , and monkey .</l>
     <l n="193">‘ Twill vastly mend your situation ,</l>
     <l n="194">To meet with one false accusation ;</l>
     <l n="195">For ev'ry fault you thence commit ,</l>
     <l n="196">Of course you think it just and fit</l>
     <l n="197">To make to that some pert allusion ,</l>
     <l n="198">To all the family 's confusion :</l>
     <l n="199">In short , your triumph 's now so plain ,</l>
     <l n="200">They never dare find fault again .</l>
     <l n="201">Well , then : do n't go and be so hateful ,</l>
     <l n="202">As to turn round , and prove ungrateful ,</l>
     <l n="203">Drawing fresh pertness from my page ,</l>
     <l n="204">E'en should you reach Methus'lem ' s age ,</l>
     <l n="205">And whilst I 've plann 'd my whole endeavour ,</l>
     <l n="206">For you and for your ‘ AIRS ’ for ever !</l>
     <l n="207">Now then for conjuration tricks :</l>
     <l n="208">Turn bottles into candlesticks ,</l>
     <l n="209">And , unrestrained by vulgar rules ,</l>
     <l n="210">Good four-legg 'd chairs to three-legg 'd stools .</l>
     <l n="211">Make dusters out of fancy-works ,</l>
     <l n="212">Chew 'd paper into patent corks ,</l>
     <l n="213">With sundry excellent expedients ,</l>
     <l n="214">Form 'd from the most grotesque ingredients ,</l>
     <l n="215">Which can n't be quite politely spoken ,</l>
     <l n="216">When any thing is lost or broken .</l>
     <l n="217">The tongs or shovel serves the stoker</l>
     <l n="218">When once you 've broke the kitchen poker ,</l>
     <l n="219">( A hardish job , as some may view it ,</l>
     <l n="220">Yet some of you know how to do it ) ;</l>
     <l n="221">Or Master 's cane may go to wrack ,</l>
     <l n="222">To keep it off the stoker 's back !</l>
     <l n="223">Still ‘ one more word ': I do beseech you ,</l>
     <l n="224">If disapproving aught I teach you ,—</l>
     <l n="225">( Which I not only wo n't resent ,</l>
     <l n="226">But deem my highest compliment ,</l>
     <l n="227">The true intent ‘ no how ’ mistook ,</l>
     <l n="228">With which I really wrote this book ,)</l>
     <l n="229">Simply from EVERY LESSON vary ,</l>
     <l n="230">And ‘ take and do ’ the ‘ clean contrary ! ’</l>
     <l n="231">Your fellow-servants thus alarming ,</l>
     <l n="232">Say that “ variety is charming : ”</l>
     <l n="233">Let ‘ em keep mimicking and watching ,</l>
     <l n="234">And may they find that “ mocking 's catching ! ”</l>
     <l n="235">But one more rhyme I now can hitch in ,</l>
     <l n="236">To swell the ‘ GLORIES OF THE KITCHEN ; ’</l>
     <l n="237">Where you may romp and break the chairs ,</l>
     <l n="238">Discuss all family affairs ,</l>
     <l n="239">What to refuse , and what to grant ,</l>
     <l n="240">What you ‘ shall ’ do , and what you ‘ sha n't : ’</l>
     <l n="241">Laugh , sing , and squall , vote care a viper ,</l>
     <l n="242">Dancing while Master ‘ pays the piper , ’</l>
     <l n="243">And boast the jovial , endless cheer ,</l>
     <l n="244">Which makes it ‘ CHRISTMAS ALL THE YEAR ! ’</l>
