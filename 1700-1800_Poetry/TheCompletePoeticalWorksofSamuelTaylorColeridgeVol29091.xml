    <head>FROST AT MIDNIGHT [ 240 : 1 ]</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The Frost performs its secret ministry ,</l>
     <l n="2">Unhelped by any wind . The owlet 's cry</l>
     <l n="3">Came loud — and hark , again ! loud as before .</l>
     <l n="4">The inmates of my cottage , all at rest ,</l>
     <l n="5">Have left me to that solitude , which suits 5</l>
     <l n="6">Abstruser musings : save that at my side</l>
     <l n="7">My cradled infant slumbers peacefully .</l>
     <l n="8">‘ Tis calm indeed ! so calm that it disturbs</l>
     <l n="9">And vexes meditation with its strange</l>
     <l n="10">And extreme silentness . Sea , hill , and wood , 10</l>
     <l n="11">This populous village ! Sea , and hill , and wood ,</l>
     <l n="12">With all the numberless goings-on of life ,</l>
     <l n="13">Inaudible as dreams ! the thin blue flame</l>
     <l n="14">Lies on my low-burnt fire , and quivers not ;</l>
     <l n="15">Only that film , [ 240 : 2 ] which fluttered on the grate , 15</l>
     <l n="16">Still flutters there , the sole unquiet thing .</l>
     <l n="17">Methinks , its motion in this hush of nature</l>
     <l n="18">Gives it dim sympathies with me who live ,</l>
     <l n="19">Making it a companionable form ,</l>
     <l n="20">Whose puny flaps and freaks the idling Spirit 20</l>
     <l n="21">By its own moods interprets , every where</l>
     <l n="22">Echo or mirror seeking of itself ,</l>
     <l n="23">And makes a toy of Thought .</l>
     <l n="24">But O ! how oft ,</l>
     <l n="25">How oft , at school , with most believing mind ,</l>
     <l n="26">Presageful , have I gazed upon the bars , 25</l>
     <l n="27">To watch that fluttering stranger ! and as oft</l>
     <l n="28">With unclosed lids , already had I dreamt</l>
     <l n="29">Of my sweet birth-place , and the old church-tower ,</l>
     <l n="30">Whose bells , the poor man 's only music , rang</l>
     <l n="31">From morn to evening , all the hot Fair-day , 30</l>
     <l n="32">So sweetly , that they stirred and haunted me</l>
     <l n="33">With a wild pleasure , falling on mine ear</l>
     <l n="34">Most like articulate sounds of things to come !</l>
     <l n="35">So gazed I , till the soothing things , I dreamt ,</l>
     <l n="36">Lulled me to sleep , and sleep prolonged my dreams ! 35</l>
     <l n="37">And so I brooded all the following morn ,</l>
     <l n="38">Awed by the stern preceptor 's face , mine eye</l>
     <l n="39">Fixed with mock study on my swimming book :</l>
     <l n="40">Save if the door half opened , and I snatched</l>
     <l n="41">A hasty glance , and still my heart leaped up , 40</l>
     <l n="42">For still I hoped to see the stranger 's face ,</l>
     <l n="43">Townsman , or aunt , or sister more beloved ,</l>
     <l n="44">My play-mate when we both were clothed alike !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="45">Dear Babe , that sleepest cradled by my side ,</l>
     <l n="46">Whose gentle breathings , heard in this deep calm , 45</l>
     <l n="47">Fill up the intersperséd vacancies</l>
     <l n="48">And momentary pauses of the thought !</l>
     <l n="49">My babe so beautiful ! it thrills my heart</l>
     <l n="50">With tender gladness , thus to look at thee ,</l>
     <l n="51">And think that thou shalt learn far other lore , 50</l>
     <l n="52">And in far other scenes ! For I was reared</l>
     <l n="53">In the great city , pent ‘ mid cloisters dim ,</l>
     <l n="54">And saw nought lovely but the sky and stars .</l>
     <l n="55">But thou , my babe ! shalt wander like a breeze</l>
     <l n="56">By lakes and sandy shores , beneath the crags 55</l>
     <l n="57">Of ancient mountain , and beneath the clouds ,</l>

    <head>ORIGINAL POETRY .</head>
    <head>The following excellent Ode will be in unison with the feelings of every friend to Liberty and foe to Oppression ; of all who , admiring the French Revolution , detest and deplore the conduct of France towards Switzerland . It is very satisfactory to find so zealous and steady an advocate for Freedom as Mr. COLERIDGE concur with us in condemning the conduct of France towards the Swiss Cantons . Indeed his concurrence is not singular ; we know of no Friend to Liberty who is not of his opinion . What we most admire is the avowal of his sentiments , and public censure of the unprincipled and atrocious conduct of France . The Poem itself is written with great energy . The second , third , and fourth stanzas contain some of the most vigorous lines we have ever read . The lines in the fourth stanza :—</head>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The following ODE was first published in this paper ( in the beginning of the year 1798 ) in a less perfect state . The present state of France and Switzerland give it so peculiar an interest at the present time that we wished to re-publish it and accordingly have procured from the Author a corrected copy .</p>
   <p>ARGUMENT .</p>
   <p>‘ First Stanza . An invocation to those objects in Nature the contemplation of which had inspired the Poet with a devotional love of Liberty . Second Stanza . The exultation of the Poet at the commencement of the French Revolution , and his unqualified abhorrence of the Alliance against the Republic . Third Stanza . The blasphemies and horrors during the domination of the Terrorists regarded by the Poet as a transient storm , and as the natural consequence of the former despotism and of the foul superstition of Popery . Reason , indeed , began to suggest many apprehensions ; yet still the Poet struggled to retain the hope that France would make conquests by no other means than by presenting to the observation of Europe a people more happy and better instructed than under other forms of Government . Fourth Stanza . Switzerland , and the Poet 's recantation . Fifth Stanza . An address to Liberty , in which the Poet expresses his conviction that those feelings and that grand ideal of Freedom which the mind attains by its contemplation of its individual nature , and of the sublime surrounding objects ( see Stanza the First ) do not belong to men , as a society , nor can possibly be either gratified or realised , under any form of human government ; but belong to the individual man , so far as he is pure , and inflamed with the love and adoration of God in Nature . ’</p>

    <head>THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS [ 248 : 1 ]</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Stranger ! whose eyes a look of pity shew ,</l>
     <l n="2">Say , will you listen to a tale of woe ?</l>
     <l n="3">A tale in no unwonted horrors drest ;</l>
     <l n="4">But sweet is pity to an agéd breast .</l>
     <l n="5">This voice did falter with old age before ; 5</l>
     <l n="6">Sad recollections make it falter more .</l>
     <l n="7">Beside the torrent and beneath a wood ,</l>
     <l n="8">High in these Alps my summer cottage stood ;</l>
     <l n="9">One daughter still remain 'd to cheer my way ,</l>
     <l n="10">The evening-star of life 's declining day : 10</l>
     <l n="11">Duly she hied to fill her milking-pail ,</l>
     <l n="12">Ere shout of herdsmen rang from cliff or vale ;</l>
     <l n="13">When she return 'd , before the summer shiel ,</l>
     <l n="14">On the fresh grass she spread the dairy meal ;</l>
     <l n="15">Just as the snowy peaks began to lose 15</l>
     <l n="16">In glittering silver lights their rosy hues .</l>
     <l n="17">Singing in woods or bounding o'er the lawn ,</l>
     <l n="18">No blither creature hail 'd the early dawn ;</l>
     <l n="19">And if I spoke of hearts by pain oppress 'd .</l>
     <l n="20">When every friend is gone to them that rest ; 20</l>
     <l n="21">Or of old men that leave , when they expire ,</l>
     <l n="22">Daughters , that should have perish 'd with their sire —</l>
     <l n="23">Leave them to toil all day through paths unknown ,</l>
     <l n="24">And house at night behind some sheltering stone ;</l>
     <l n="25">Impatient of the thought , with lively cheer 25</l>
     <l n="26">She broke half-closed the tasteless tale severe .</l>
     <l n="27">She play 'd with fancies of a gayer hue ,</l>
     <l n="28">Enamour 'd of the scenes her wishes drew ;</l>
     <l n="29">And oft she prattled with an eager tongue</l>
     <l n="30">Of promised joys that would not loiter long , 30</l>
     <l n="31">Till with her tearless eyes so bright and fair ,</l>
     <l n="32">She seem 'd to see them realis 'd in air !</l>
     <l n="33">In fancy oft , within some sunny dell ,</l>
     <l n="34">Where never wolf should howl or tempest yell ,</l>
     <l n="35">She built a little home of joy and rest , 35</l>
     <l n="36">And fill 'd it with the friends whom she lov 'd best :</l>
     <l n="37">She named the inmates of her fancied cot ,</l>
     <l n="38">And gave to each his own peculiar lot ;</l>
     <l n="39">Which with our little herd abroad should roam ,</l>
     <l n="40">And which should tend the dairy 's toil at home , 40</l>
     <l n="41">And now the hour approach 'd which should restore</l>
     <l n="42">Her lover from the wars , to part no more .</l>
     <l n="43">Her whole frame fluttered with uneasy joy ;</l>
     <l n="44">I long 'd myself to clasp the valiant boy ;</l>
     <l n="45">And though I strove to calm her eager mood , 45</l>
     <l n="46">It was my own sole thought in solitude .</l>
     <l n="47">I told it to the Saints amid my hymns —</l>
     <l n="48">For O ! you know not , on an old man 's limbs</l>
     <l n="49">How thrillingly the pleasant sun-beams play ,</l>
     <l n="50">That shine upon his daughter 's wedding-day . 50</l>
     <l n="51">I hoped , that those fierce tempests , soon to rave</l>
     <l n="52">Unheard , unfelt , around my mountain grave ,</l>
     <l n="53">Not undelightfully would break her rest ,</l>
     <l n="54">While she lay pillow 'd on her lover 's breast ;</l>
     <l n="55">Or join 'd his pious prayer for pilgrims driven 55</l>
     <l n="56">Out to the mercy of the winds of heaven .</l>
     <l n="57">Yes ! now the hour approach 'd that should restore</l>
     <l n="58">Her lover from the wars to part no more .</l>
     <l n="59">Her thoughts were wild , her soul was in her eye ,</l>
     <l n="60">She wept and laugh 'd as if she knew not why ; 60</l>
     <l n="61">And she had made a song about the wars ,</l>
     <l n="62">And sang it to the sun and to the stars !</l>
     <l n="63">But while she look 'd and listen 'd , stood and ran ,</l>
     <l n="64">And saw him plain in every distant man ,</l>
     <l n="65">By treachery stabbed , on NANSY 'S murderous day , 65</l>
     <l n="66">A senseless corse th ’ expected husband lay .</l>
     <l n="67">A wounded man , who met us in the wood ,</l>
     <l n="68">Heavily ask 'd her where my cottage stood ,</l>
     <l n="69">And told us all : she cast her eyes around</l>
     <l n="70">As if his words had been but empty sound . 70</l>
     <l n="71">Then look 'd to Heav'n , like one that would deny</l>
     <l n="72">That such a thing could be beneath the sky .</l>
     <l n="73">Again he ask 'd her if she knew my name ,</l>
     <l n="74">And instantly an anguish wrench 'd her frame ,</l>
     <l n="75">And left her mind imperfect . No delight 75</l>
     <l n="76">Thenceforth she found in any cheerful sight ,</l>
     <l n="77">Not ev'n in those time-haunted wells and groves ,</l>
     <l n="78">Scenes of past joy , and birth-place of her loves .</l>
     <l n="79">If to her spirit any sound was dear ,</l>
     <l n="80">‘ Twas the deep moan that spoke the tempest near ; 80</l>
     <l n="81">Or sighs which chasms of icy vales outbreathe ,</l>
     <l n="82">Sent from the dark , imprison 'd floods beneath .</l>
     <l n="83">She wander 'd up the crag and down the slope ,</l>
     <l n="84">But not , as in her happy days of hope ,</l>
     <l n="85">To seek the churning-plant of sovereign power , 85</l>
     <l n="86">That grew in clefts and bore a scarlet flower !</l>
     <l n="87">She roam 'd , without a purpose , all alone ,</l>
     <l n="88">Thro ’ high grey vales unknowing and unknown .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="89">Kind-hearted stranger ! patiently you hear</l>
     <l n="90">A tedious tale : I thank you for that tear . 90</l>
     <l n="91">May never other tears o'ercloud your eye ,</l>
     <l n="92">Than those which gentle Pity can supply !</l>
     <l n="93">Did you not mark a towering convent hang ,</l>
     <l n="94">Where the huge rocks with sounds of torrents rang ?</l>
     <l n="95">Ev'n yet , methinks , its spiry turrets swim 95</l>
     <l n="96">Amid yon purple gloom ascending dim !</l>
     <l n="97">For thither oft would my poor child repair ,</l>
     <l n="98">To ease her soul by penitence and prayer .</l>
     <l n="99">I knew that peace at good men 's prayers returns</l>
     <l n="100">Home to the contrite heart of him that mourns , 100</l>
     <l n="101">And check 'd her not ; and often there she found</l>
     <l n="102">A timely pallet when the evening frown 'd .</l>
     <l n="103">And there I trusted that my child would light</l>
     <l n="104">On shelter and on food , one dreadful night ,</l>
     <l n="105">When there was uproar in the element , 105</l>
     <l n="106">And she was absent . To my rest I went :</l>
     <l n="107">I thought her safe , yet often did I wake</l>
     <l n="108">And felt my very heart within me ache .</l>
     <l n="109">No daughter near me , at this very door ,</l>
     <l n="110">Next morn I listen 'd to the dying roar . 110</l>
     <l n="111">Above , below , the prowling vulture wail 'd ,</l>
     <l n="112">And down the cliffs the heavy vapour sail 'd .</l>
     <l n="113">Up by the wide-spread waves in fury torn ,</l>
     <l n="114">Homestalls and pines along the vale were borne .</l>
     <l n="115">The Dalesmen in thick crowds appear 'd below 115</l>
     <l n="116">Clearing the road , o'erwhelm ' d with hills of snow .</l>
     <l n="117">At times to the proud gust 's ascending swell ,</l>
     <l n="118">A pack of blood-hounds flung their doleful yell :</l>
     <l n="119">For after nights of storm , that dismal train</l>
     <l n="120">The pious convent sends , with hope humane , 120</l>
     <l n="121">To find some out-stretch 'd man — perchance to save ,</l>
     <l n="122">Or give , at least , that last good gift , a grave !</l>
     <l n="123">But now a gathering crowd did I survey ,</l>
     <l n="124">That slowly up the pasture bent their way ;</l>
     <l n="125">Nor could I doubt but that their care had found 125</l>
     <l n="126">Some pilgrim in th ’ unchannel 'd torrent drown 'd .</l>
     <l n="127">And down the lawn I hasten 'd to implore</l>
     <l n="128">That they would bring the body to my door ;</l>
     <l n="129">But soon exclaim 'd a boy , who ran before ,</l>
     <l n="130">‘ Thrown by the last night 's waters from their bed , 130</l>
     <l n="131">Your daughter has been found , and she is dead ! ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="132">The old man paused — May he who , sternly just ,</l>
     <l n="133">Lays at his will his creatures in the dust ;</l>
     <l n="134">Some ere the earliest buds of hope be blown ,</l>
     <l n="135">And some , when every bloom of joy is flown ; 135</l>
     <l n="136">May he the parent to his child restore</l>

     <l n="1">At midnight by the stream I roved ,</l>

     <l n="3">Image of Lewti ! from my mind</l>
     <l n="4">Depart ; for Lewti is not kind .</l>
     <l n="5">The Moon was high , the moonlight gleam 5</l>
     <l n="6">And the shadow of a star</l>
     <l n="7">Heaved upon Tamaha 's stream ;</l>
     <l n="8">But the rock shone brighter far ,</l>
     <l n="9">The rock half sheltered from my view</l>
     <l n="10">By pendent boughs of tressy yew .— 10</l>
     <l n="11">So shines my Lewti 's forehead fair ,</l>
     <l n="12">Gleaming through her sable hair .</l>

     <l n="15">I saw a cloud of palest hue , 15</l>
     <l n="16">Onward to the moon it passed ;</l>
     <l n="17">Still brighter and more bright it grew ,</l>
     <l n="18">With floating colours not a few ,</l>
     <l n="19">Till it reached the moon at last :</l>
     <l n="20">Then the cloud was wholly bright , 20</l>
     <l n="21">With a rich and amber light !</l>
     <l n="22">And so with many a hope I seek ,</l>
     <l n="23">And with such joy I find my Lewti ;</l>
     <l n="24">And even so my pale wan cheek</l>
     <l n="25">Drinks in as deep a flush of beauty ! 25</l>

     <l n="31">Its hues are dim , its hues are grey —</l>
     <l n="32">Away it passes from the moon !</l>
     <l n="33">How mournfully it seems to fly ,</l>
     <l n="34">Ever fading more and more ,</l>
     <l n="35">To joyless regions of the sky — 35</l>
     <l n="36">And now ‘ tis whiter than before !</l>
     <l n="37">As white as my poor cheek will be ,</l>
     <l n="38">When , Lewti ! on my couch I lie ,</l>
     <l n="39">A dying man for love of thee .</l>

     <l n="71">And creep , like thee , with soundless tread ,</l>
     <l n="72">I then might view her bosom white</l>

    <head>FOOTNOTES :</head>
    <head>[ 253 : 1 ] First published in the Morning Post ( under the signature Nicias Erythraeus ) , April 18 , 1798 : included in the Annual Anthology , 1800 ; Sibylline Leaves , 1817 , 1828 , 1829 , and 1834 . For MS. versions vide Appendices . ‘ Lewti was to have been included in the Lyrical Ballads of 1798 , but at the last moment the sheets containing it were cancelled and The Nightingale substituted . ’ ( Note to reprint of L. B . ( 1898 ) , edited by T . Hutchinson . ) A copy which belonged to Southey , with the new Table of Contents and The Nightingale bound up with the text as at first printed , is in the British Museum . Another copy is extant which contains the first Table of Contents only , and Lewti without the addition of The Nightingale . In the M. P. the following note accompanies the poem :— ‘ It is not amongst the least pleasing of our recollections , that we have been the means of gratifying the public taste with some exquisite pieces of Original Poetry . For many of them we have been indebted to the author of the Circassian 's Love Chant . Amidst images of war and woe , amidst scenes of carnage and horror of devastation and dismay , it may afford the mind a temporary relief to wander to the magic haunts of the Muses , to bowers and fountains which the despoiling powers of war have never visited , and where the lover pours forth his complaint , or receives the recompense of his constancy . The whole of the subsequent Love Chant is in a warm and impassioned strain . The fifth and last stanzas are , we think , the best . ’</head>

    <head>FEARS IN SOLITUDE [ 256 : 1 ]</head>
    <head>WRITTEN IN APRIL 1798 , DURING THE ALARM OF AN INVASION</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A green and silent spot , amid the hills ,</l>
     <l n="2">A small and silent dell ! O'er stiller place</l>
     <l n="3">No singing sky-lark ever poised himself .</l>
     <l n="4">The hills are heathy , save that swelling slope ,</l>
     <l n="5">Which hath a gay and gorgeous covering on , 5</l>
     <l n="6">All golden with the never-bloomless furze ,</l>
     <l n="7">Which now blooms most profusely : but the dell ,</l>
     <l n="8">Bathed by the mist , is fresh and delicate</l>
     <l n="9">As vernal corn-field , or the unripe flax ,</l>
     <l n="10">When , through its half-transparent stalks , at eve , 10</l>
     <l n="11">The level sunshine glimmers with green light .</l>
     <l n="12">Oh ! ‘ tis a quiet spirit-healing nook !</l>
     <l n="13">Which all , methinks , would love ; but chiefly he ,</l>
     <l n="14">The humble man , who , in his youthful years ,</l>
     <l n="15">Knew just so much of folly , as had made 15</l>
     <l n="16">His early manhood more securely wise !</l>
     <l n="17">Here he might lie on fern or withered heath ,</l>
     <l n="18">While from the singing lark ( that sings unseen</l>
     <l n="19">The minstrelsy that solitude loves best ) ,</l>
     <l n="20">And from the sun , and from the breezy air , 20</l>
     <l n="21">Sweet influences trembled o'er his frame ;</l>
     <l n="22">And he , with many feelings , many thoughts ,</l>
     <l n="23">Made up a meditative joy , and found</l>
     <l n="24">Religious meanings in the forms of Nature !</l>
     <l n="25">And so , his senses gradually wrapt 25</l>
     <l n="26">In a half sleep , he dreams of better worlds ,</l>
     <l n="27">And dreaming hears thee still , O singing lark ,</l>
     <l n="28">That singest like an angel in the clouds !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="29">My God ! it is a melancholy thing</l>
     <l n="30">For such a man , who would full fain preserve 30</l>
     <l n="31">His soul in calmness , yet perforce must feel</l>
     <l n="32">For all his human brethren — O my God !</l>
     <l n="33">It weighs upon the heart , that he must think</l>
     <l n="34">What uproar and what strife may now be stirring</l>
     <l n="35">This way or that way o'er these silent hills — 35</l>
     <l n="36">Invasion , and the thunder and the shout ,</l>
     <l n="37">And all the crash of onset ; fear and rage ,</l>
     <l n="38">And undetermined conflict — even now ,</l>
     <l n="39">Even now , perchance , and in his native isle :</l>
     <l n="40">Carnage and groans beneath this blessed sun ! 40</l>
     <l n="41">We have offended , Oh ! my countrymen !</l>
     <l n="42">We have offended very grievously ,</l>
     <l n="43">And been most tyrannous . From east to west</l>
     <l n="44">A groan of accusation pierces Heaven !</l>
     <l n="45">The wretched plead against us ; multitudes 45</l>
     <l n="46">Countless and vehement , the sons of God ,</l>
     <l n="47">Our brethren ! Like a cloud that travels on .</l>
     <l n="48">Steamed up from Cairo 's swamps of pestilence ,</l>
     <l n="49">Even so , my countrymen ! have we gone forth</l>
     <l n="50">And borne to distant tribes slavery and pangs , 50</l>
     <l n="51">And , deadlier far , our vices , whose deep taint</l>
     <l n="52">With slow perdition murders the whole man ,</l>
     <l n="53">His body and his soul ! Meanwhile , at home ,</l>
     <l n="54">All individual dignity and power</l>
     <l n="55">Engulfed in Courts , Committees , Institutions , 55</l>
     <l n="56">Associations and Societies ,</l>
     <l n="57">A vain , speech-mouthing , speech-reporting Guild ,</l>
     <l n="58">One Benefit-Club for mutual flattery ,</l>
     <l n="59">We have drunk up , demure as at a grace ,</l>
     <l n="60">Pollutions from the brimming cup of wealth ; 60</l>
     <l n="61">Contemptuous of all honourable rule ,</l>
     <l n="62">Yet bartering freedom and the poor man 's life</l>
     <l n="63">For gold , as at a market ! The sweet words</l>
     <l n="64">Of Christian promise , words that even yet</l>
     <l n="65">Might stem destruction , were they wisely preached , 65</l>
     <l n="66">Are muttered o'er by men , whose tones proclaim</l>
     <l n="67">How flat and wearisome they feel their trade :</l>
     <l n="68">Rank scoffers some , but most too indolent</l>
     <l n="69">To deem them falsehoods or to know their truth .</l>
     <l n="70">Oh ! blasphemous ! the Book of Life is made 70</l>
     <l n="71">A superstitious instrument , on which</l>
     <l n="72">We gabble o'er the oaths we mean to break ;</l>
     <l n="73">For all must swear — all and in every place ,</l>
     <l n="74">College and wharf , council and justice-court ;</l>
     <l n="75">All , all must swear , the briber and the bribed , 75</l>
     <l n="76">Merchant and lawyer , senator and priest ,</l>
     <l n="77">The rich , the poor , the old man and the young ;</l>
     <l n="78">All , all make up one scheme of perjury ,</l>
     <l n="79">That faith doth reel ; the very name of God</l>
     <l n="80">Sounds like a juggler 's charm ; and , bold with joy , 80</l>
     <l n="81">Forth from his dark and lonely hiding-place ,</l>
     <l n="82">( Portentous sight ! ) the owlet Atheism ,</l>
     <l n="83">Sailing on obscene wings athwart the noon ,</l>

   <p>[ 256 : 1 ] First published in a quarto pamphlet ‘ printed by J. Johnson in S. Paul 's Churchyard , 1798 ': included in Poetical Register , 1808-9 ( 1812 ) , and , with the same text , in an octavo pamphlet printed by Law and Gilbert in (? ) 1812 : in Sibylline Leaves , 1817 , 1828 , 1829 , and 1834 . Lines 129-97 were reprinted in the Morning Post , Oct. 14 , 1802 . They follow the reprint of France : an Ode , and are thus prefaced :— ‘ The following extracts are made from a Poem by the same author , written in April 1798 during the alarm respecting the threatened invasion . They were included in The Friend , No . II ( June 8 , 1809 ) , as Fears of Solitude . ’ An autograph MS. ( in the possession of Professor Dowden ) , undated but initialled S. T. C ., is subscribed as follows :— ‘ N. B . The above is perhaps not Poetry ,— but rather a sort of middle thing between Poetry and Oratory — sermoni propriora .— Some parts are , I am conscious , too tame even for animated prose . ’ An autograph MS. dated ( as below 232 ) is in the possession of Mr. Gordon Wordsworth .</p>

   <p>THE THREE GRAVES [ 267 : 1 ]</p>
   <p>A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON 'S TALE</p>
   <p>‘ The Author has published the following humble fragment , encouraged by the decisive recommendation of more than one of our most celebrated living Poets . The language was intended to be dramatic ; that is , suited to the narrator ; and the metre corresponds to the homeliness of the diction . It is therefore presented as the fragment , not of a Poem , but of a common Ballad-tale . [ 268 : 1 ] Whether this is sufficient to justify the adoption of such a style , in any metrical composition not professedly ludicrous , the Author is himself in some doubt . At all events , it is not presented as poetry , and it is in no way connected with the Author 's judgment concerning poetic diction . Its merits , if any , are exclusively psychological . The story which must be supposed to have been narrated in the first and second parts is as follows :—</p>
   <p>‘ Edward , a young farmer , meets at the house of Ellen her bosom-friend Mary , and commences an acquaintance , which ends in a mutual attachment . With her consent , and by the advice of their common friend Ellen , he announces his hopes and intentions to Mary 's mother , a widow-woman bordering on her fortieth year , and from constant health , the possession of a competent property , and from having had no other children but Mary and another daughter ( the father died in their infancy ) , retaining for the greater part her personal attractions and comeliness of appearance ; but a woman of low education and violent temper . The answer which she at once returned to Edward 's application was remarkable — “ Well , Edward ! you are a handsome young fellow , and you shall have my daughter . ” From this time all their wooing passed under the mother 's eye ; and , in fine , she became herself enamoured of her future son-in-law , and practised every art , both of endearment and of calumny , to transfer his affections from her daughter to herself . ( The outlines of the Tale are positive facts , and of no very distant date , though the author has purposely altered the names and the scene of action , as well as invented the characters of the parties and the detail of the incidents . ) Edward , however , though perplexed by her strange detractions from her daughter 's good qualities , yet in the innocence of his own heart still mistook [ 268 : 2 ] her increasing fondness for motherly affection ; she at length , overcome by her miserable passion , after much abuse of Mary 's temper and moral tendencies , exclaimed with violent emotion — “ O Edward ! indeed , indeed , she is not fit for you — she has not a heart to love you as you deserve . It is I that love you ! Marry me , Edward ! and I will this very day settle all my property on you . ” The Lover 's eyes were now opened ; and thus taken by surprise , whether from the effect of the horror which he felt , acting as it were hysterically on his nervous system , or that at the first moment he lost the sense of the guilt of the proposal in the feeling of its strangeness and absurdity , he flung her from him and burst into a fit of laughter . Irritated by this almost to frenzy , the woman fell on her knees , and in a loud voice that approached to a scream , she prayed for a curse both on him and on her own child . Mary happened to be in the room directly above them , heard Edward 's laugh , and her mother 's blasphemous prayer , and fainted away . He , hearing the fall , ran upstairs , and taking her in his arms , carried her off to Ellen 's home ; and after some fruitless attempts on her part toward a reconciliation with her mother , she was married to him .— And here the third part of the Tale begins .</p>
   <p>‘ I was not led to choose this story from any partiality to tragic , much less to monstrous events ( though at the time that I composed the verses , somewhat more than twelve years ago , I was less averse to such subjects than at present ) , but from finding in it a striking proof of the possible effect on the imagination , from an idea violently and suddenly impressed on it . I had been reading Bryan Edwards 's account of the effects of the Oby witchcraft on the Negroes in the West Indies , and Hearne 's deeply interesting anecdotes of similar workings on the imagination of the Copper Indians ( those of my readers who have it in their power will be well repaid for the trouble of referring to those works for the passages alluded to ) ; and I conceived the design of shewing that instances of this kind are not peculiar to savage or barbarous tribes , and of illustrating the mode in which the mind is affected in these cases , and the progress and symptoms of the morbid action on the fancy from the beginning .</p>
   <p>‘ The Tale is supposed to be narrated by an old Sexton , in a country church-yard , to a traveller whose curiosity had been awakened by the appearance of three graves , close by each other , to two only of which there were grave-stones . On the first of these was the name , and dates , as usual : on the second , no name , but only a date , and the words , “ The Mercy of God is infinite . [ 269 : 1 ]" ’ S. L. 1817 , 1828 , 1829 .</p>

    <head>FOOTNOTES :</head>
    <head>[ 267 : 1 ] Parts III and IV of the Three Graves were first published in The Friend , No . VI , September 21 , 1809 . They were included in Sibylline Leaves , 1817 , 1828 , 1829 , and 1834 . Parts I and II , which were probably written in the spring of 1798 , at the same time as Parts III and IV , were first published , from an autograph MS. copy , in Poems , 1893 . [ For evidence of date compare ll . 255-8 with Dorothy Wordsworth 's Alfoxden Journal for March 20 , 24 , and April 6 , 8 . ] The original MS. of Parts III and IV is not forthcoming . The MS. of the poem as published in The Friend is in the handwriting of Miss Sarah Stoddart ( afterwards Mrs. Hazlitt ) , and is preserved with other ‘ copy ’ of The Friend ( of which the greater part is in the handwriting of Miss Sarah Hutchinson ) in the Forster Collection which forms part of the Victoria and Albert Museum , South Kensington . The preface and emendations are in the handwriting of S. T. C. The poem was reprinted in the British Minstrel , Glasgow , 1821 as ‘ a modern ballad of the very first rank ’ . In a marginal note in Mr. Samuel 's copy of Sibylline Leaves Coleridge writes :— ‘ This very poem was selected , notwithstanding the preface , as a proof of my judgment and poetic diction , and a fair specimen of the style of my poems generally ( see the Mirror ): nay ! the very words of the preface were used , omitting the not , ’ &amp; c. See for this and other critical matter , Lyrical Ballads , 1798 , edited by Thomas Hutchinson , 1898 . Notes , p. 257 .</head>

S. T. C .] parts of a Tale consisting of six . The two last parts may be given hereafter , if the present should appear to have afforded pleasure , and to have answered the purpose of a relief and amusement to my Readers . The story as it is contained in the first and second parts is as follows : Edward a young farmer , etc . ’</p>

   <p>THE WANDERINGS OF CAIN [ 285 : 1 ]</p>
   <p>PREFATORY NOTE</p>
   <p>A prose composition , one not in metre at least , seems primâ facie to require explanation or apology . It was written in the year 1798 , near Nether Stowey , in Somersetshire , at which place ( sanctum et amabile nomen ! rich by so many associations and recollections ) the author had taken up his residence in order to enjoy the society and close neighbourhood of a dear and honoured friend , T. Poole , Esq . The work was to have been written in concert with another [ Wordsworth ] , whose name is too venerable within the precincts of genius to be unnecessarily brought into connection with such a trifle , and who was then residing at a small distance from Nether Stowey . The title and subject were suggested by myself , who likewise drew out the scheme and the contents for each of the three books or cantos , of which the work was to consist , and which , the reader is to be informed , was to have been finished in one night ! My partner undertook the first canto : I the second : and which ever had done first , was to set about the third . Almost thirty years have passed by ; yet at this moment I cannot without something more than a smile moot the question which of the two things was the more impracticable , for a mind so eminently original to compose another man 's thoughts and fancies , or for a taste so austerely pure and simple to imitate the Death of Abel ? Methinks I see his grand and noble countenance as at the moment when having despatched my own portion of the task at full finger-speed , I hastened to him with my manuscript — that look of humourous despondency fixed on his almost blank sheet of paper , and then its silent mock-piteous admission of failure struggling with the sense of the exceeding ridiculousness of the whole scheme — which broke up in a laugh : and the Ancient Mariner was written instead .</p>
   <p>Years afterward , however , the draft of the plan and proposed incidents , and the portion executed , obtained favour in the eyes of more than one person , whose judgment on a poetic work could not but have weighed with me , even though no parental partiality had been thrown into the same scale , as a make-weight : and I determined on commencing anew , and composing the whole in stanzas , and made some progress in realising this intention , when adverse gales drove my bark off the ‘ Fortunate Isles ’ of the Muses : and then other and more momentous interests prompted a different voyage , to firmer anchorage and a securer port . I have in vain tried to recover the lines from the palimpsest tablet of my memory : and I can only offer the introductory stanza , which had been committed to writing for the purpose of procuring a friend 's judgment on the metre , as a specimen :—</p>

     <l n="6">The moon was bright , the air was free ,</l>
     <l n="7">And fruits and flowers together grew</l>
     <l n="8">On many a shrub and many a tree :</l>

     <l n="15">That beauteous Boy to linger here ?</l>
     <l n="16">Alone , by night , a little child ,</l>
     <l n="17">In place so silent and so wild —</l>
     <l n="18">Has he no friend , no loving mother near ?</l>

   <p>I have here given the birth , parentage , and premature decease of the ‘ Wanderings of Cain , a poem ’ ,— intreating , however , my Readers , not to think so meanly of my judgment as to suppose that I either regard or offer it as any excuse for the publication of the following fragment ( and I may add , of one or two others in its neighbourhood ) in its primitive crudity . But I should find still greater difficulty in forgiving myself were I to record pro taedio publico a set of petty mishaps and annoyances which I myself wish to forget . I must be content therefore with assuring the friendly Reader , that the less he attributes its appearance to the Author 's will , choice , or judgment , the nearer to the truth he will be .</p>
   <p>S. T. COLERIDGE ( 1828 ) .</p>
   <p>THE WANDERINGS OF CAIN</p>
    <p>CANTO II</p>
   <p>‘ A little further , O my father , yet a little further , and we shall come into the open moonlight . ’ Their road was through a forest of fir-trees ; at its entrance the trees stood at distances from each other , and the path was broad , and the moonlight and the moonlight shadows reposed upon it , 5 and appeared quietly to inhabit that solitude . But soon the path winded and became narrow ; the sun at high noon sometimes speckled , but never illumined it , and now it was dark as a cavern .</p>
   <p>‘ It is dark , O my father ! ’ said Enos , ‘ but the path under 10 our feet is smooth and soft , and we shall soon come out into the open moonlight . ’</p>
   <p>‘ Lead on , my child ! ’ said Cain ; ‘ guide me , little child ! ’ And the innocent little child clasped a finger of the hand which had murdered the righteous Abel , and he guided his 15 father . ‘ The fir branches drip upon thee , my son . ’ ‘ Yea , pleasantly , father , for I ran fast and eagerly to bring thee the pitcher and the cake , and my body is not yet cool . How happy the squirrels are that feed on these fir-trees ! they leap from bough to bough , and the old squirrels play round their 20 young ones in the nest . I clomb a tree yesterday at noon , O my father , that I might play with them , but they leaped away from the branches , even to the slender twigs did they leap , and in a moment I beheld them on another tree . Why , O my father , would they not play with me ? I would be good 25 to them as thou art good to me : and I groaned to them even as thou groanest when thou givest me to eat , and when thou coverest me at evening , and as often as I stand at thy knee and thine eyes look at me ? ’ Then Cain stopped , and stifling his groans he sank to the earth , and the child Enos 30 stood in the darkness beside him .</p>
   <p>And Cain lifted up his voice and cried bitterly , and said , ‘ The Mighty One that persecuteth me is on this side and on that ; he pursueth my soul like the wind , like the sand-blast he passeth through me ; he is around me even as the air ! 35 O that I might be utterly no more ! I desire to die — yea , the things that never had life , neither move they upon the earth — behold ! they seem precious to mine eyes . O that a man might live without the breath of his nostrils . So I might abide in darkness , and blackness , and an empty 40 space ! Yea , I would lie down , I would not rise , neither would I stir my limbs till I became as the rock in the den of the lion , on which the young lion resteth his head whilst he sleepeth . For the torrent that roareth far off hath a voice : and the clouds in heaven look terribly on me ; the Mighty One 45 who is against me speaketh in the wind of the cedar grove ; and in silence am I dried up . ’ Then Enos spake to his father , ‘ Arise , my father , arise , we are but a little way from the place where I found the cake and the pitcher . ’ And Cain said , ‘ How knowest thou ! ’ and the child answered :— ‘ Behold the 50 bare rocks are a few of thy strides distant from the forest ; and while even now thou wert lifting up thy voice , I heard the echo . ’ Then the child took hold of his father , as if he would raise him : and Cain being faint and feeble rose slowly on his knees and pressed himself against the trunk of a fir , 55 and stood upright and followed the child .</p>
   <p>The path was dark till within three strides ’ length of its termination , when it turned suddenly ; the thick black trees formed a low arch , and the moonlight appeared for a moment like a dazzling portal . Enos ran before and stood in the open 60 air ; and when Cain , his father , emerged from the darkness , the child was affrighted . For the mighty limbs of Cain were wasted as by fire ; his hair was as the matted curls on the bison 's forehead , and so glared his fierce and sullen eye beneath : and the black abundant locks on either side , a rank 65 and tangled mass , were stained and scorched , as though the grasp of a burning iron hand had striven to rend them ; and his countenance told in a strange and terrible language of agonies that had been , and were , and were still to continue to be .</p>
   <p>The scene around was desolate ; as far as the eye could 70 reach it was desolate : the bare rocks faced each other , and left a long and wide interval of thin white sand . You might wander on and look round and round , and peep into the crevices of the rocks and discover nothing that acknowledged the influence of the seasons . There was no spring , no summer , 75 no autumn : and the winter 's snow , that would have been lovely , fell not on these hot rocks and scorching sands . Never morning lark had poised himself over this desert ; but the huge serpent often hissed there beneath the talons of the vulture , and the vulture screamed , his wings imprisoned within the coils of 80 the serpent . The pointed and shattered summits of the ridges of the rocks made a rude mimicry of human concerns , and seemed to prophecy mutely of things that then were not ; steeples , and battlements , and ships with naked masts . As far from the wood as a boy might sling a pebble of the brook , there 85 was one rock by itself at a small distance from the main ridge . It had been precipitated there perhaps by the groan which the Earth uttered when our first father fell . Before you approached , it appeared to lie flat on the ground , but its base slanted from its point , and between its point and the sands a tall man might 90 stand upright . It was here that Enos had found the pitcher and cake , and to this place he led his father . But ere they had reached the rock they beheld a human shape : his back was towards them , and they were advancing unperceived , when they heard him smite his breast and cry aloud , ‘ Woe is me ! woe is 95 me ! I must never die again , and yet I am perishing with thirst and hunger . ’</p>
   <p>Pallid , as the reflection of the sheeted lightning on the heavy-sailing night-cloud , became the face of Cain ; but the child Enos took hold of the shaggy skin , his father 's robe , and 100 raised his eyes to his father , and listening whispered , ‘ Ere yet I could speak , I am sure , O my father , that I heard that voice . Have not I often said that I remembered a sweet voice ? O my father ! this is it ': and Cain trembled exceedingly . The voice was sweet indeed , but it was thin and querulous , 105 like that of a feeble slave in misery , who despairs altogether , yet can not refrain himself from weeping and lamentation . And , behold ! Enos glided forward , and creeping softly round the base of the rock , stood before the stranger , and looked up into his face . And the Shape shrieked , and turned round , 110 and Cain beheld him , that his limbs and his face were those of his brother Abel whom he had killed ! And Cain stood like one who struggles in his sleep because of the exceeding terribleness of a dream .</p>
   <p>Thus as he stood in silence and darkness of soul , the 115 Shape fell at his feet , and embraced his knees , and cried out with a bitter outcry , ‘ Thou eldest born of Adam , whom Eve , my mother , brought forth , cease to torment me ! I was feeding my flocks in green pastures by the side of quiet rivers , and thou killedst me ; and now I am in misery . ’ Then Cain 120 closed his eyes , and hid them with his hands ; and again he opened his eyes , and looked around him , and said to Enos , ‘ What beholdest thou ? Didst thou hear a voice , my son ? ’ ‘ Yes , my father , I beheld a man in unclean garments , and he uttered a sweet voice , full of lamentation . ’ Then Cain 125 raised up the Shape that was like Abel , and said :— ‘ The Creator of our father , who had respect unto thee , and unto thy offering , wherefore hath he forsaken thee ? ’ Then the Shape shrieked a second time , and rent his garment , and his naked skin was like the white sands beneath their feet ; 130 and he shrieked yet a third time , and threw himself on his face upon the sand that was black with the shadow of the rock , and Cain and Enos sate beside him ; the child by his right hand , and Cain by his left . They were all three under the rock , and within the shadow . The Shape that was like 135 Abel raised himself up , and spake to the child , ‘ I know where the cold waters are , but I may not drink , wherefore didst thou then take away my pitcher ? ’ But Cain said , ‘ Didst thou not find favour in the sight of the Lord thy God ? ’ The Shape answered , ‘ The Lord is God of the living only , 140 the dead have another God . ’ Then the child Enos lifted up his eyes and prayed ; but Cain rejoiced secretly in his heart . ‘ Wretched shall they be all the days of their mortal life , ’ exclaimed the Shape , ‘ who sacrifice worthy and acceptable sacrifices to the God of the dead ; but after death their toil 145 ceaseth . Woe is me , for I was well beloved by the God of the living , and cruel wert thou , O my brother , who didst snatch me away from his power and his dominion . ’ Having uttered these words , he rose suddenly , and fled over the sands : and Cain said in his heart , ‘ The curse of the Lord is on me ; 150 but who is the God of the dead ? ’ and he ran after the Shape , and the Shape fled shrieking over the sands , and the sands rose like white mists behind the steps of Cain , but the feet of him that was like Abel disturbed not the sands . He greatly outrun Cain , and turning short , he wheeled round , and came 155 again to the rock where they had been sitting , and where Enos still stood ; and the child caught hold of his garment as he passed by , and he fell upon the ground . And Cain stopped , and beholding him not , said , ‘ he has passed into the dark woods , ’ and he walked slowly back to the rocks ; and when he 160 reached it the child told him that he had caught hold of his garment as he passed by , and that the man had fallen upon the ground : and Cain once more sate beside him , and said , ‘ Abel , my brother , I would lament for thee , but that the spirit within me is withered , and burnt up with extreme agony . 165 Now , I pray thee , by thy flocks , and by thy pastures , and by the quiet rivers which thou lovedst , that thou tell me all that thou knowest . Who is the God of the dead ? where doth he make his dwelling ? what sacrifices are acceptable unto him ? for I have offered , but have not been received ; I have prayed , 170 and have not been heard ; and how can I be afflicted more than I already am ? ’ The Shape arose and answered , ‘ O that thou hadst had pity on me as I will have pity on thee . Follow me , Son of Adam ! and bring thy child with thee ! ’</p>
   <p>And they three passed over the white sands between the 175 rocks , silent as the shadows .</p>

    <head>FOOTNOTES :</head>
    <note>285 : 1 ] The Wanderings of Cain in its present shape was first published in 1828 : included in 1829 , and ( with the omission of that part of the Prefatory Note which follows the verses ) in 1834 . The verses ( ‘ Encinctured ’ , &amp; c .) were first published in the ‘ Conclusion ’ of Aids to Reflection , 1825 , p. 383 , with the following apologetic note :— ‘ Will the Reader forgive me if I attempt at once to illustrate and relieve the subject [ “ the enthusiastic Mystics ” ] by annexing the first stanza of the Poem , composed in the same year in which I wrote the Ancient Mariner and the first Book of Christabel . ’ The prose was first published without the verses or ‘ Prefatory Note ’ in the Bijou for 1828 . [ See Poems , 1893 , Notes , p. 600 .</note>
     <l n="1">A rough draft of a continuation or alternative version of the</l>
     <l n="2">Wanderings of Cain was found among Coleridge 's papers . The greater</l>
     <l n="3">portion of these fragmentary sheets was printed by the Editor , in the</l>
     <l n="4">Athenaeum of January 27 , 1894 , p. 114 . The introduction of</l>
     <l n="5">‘ alligators ’ and an ‘ immense meadow ’ help to fix the date of The</l>
     <l n="6">Wanderings of Cain . The imagery is derived from William Bartram 's</l>
     <l n="7">Travels in Florida and Carolina , which Coleridge and Wordsworth</l>
     <l n="8">studied in 1798 . Mr. Hutchinson , who reprints ( Lyrical Ballads of</l>
     <l n="9">1798 , Notes , pp . 259-60 ) a selected passage from the MS. fragment ,</l>
     <l n="10">points out ‘ that Coleridge had for a time thought of shaping the poem as</l>
     <l n="11">a narrative addressed by Cain to his wife ’ .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>‘ He falls down in a trance — when he awakes he sees a luminous body coming before him . It stands before him an orb of fire . It goes on , he moves not . It returns to him again , again retires as if wishing him to follow it . It then goes on and he follows : they are led to near the bottom of the wild woods , brooks , forests etc . etc . The Fire gradually shapes itself , retaining its luminous appearance , into the lineaments of a man . A dialogue between the fiery shape and Cain , in which the being presses upon him the enormity of his guilt and that he must make some expiation to the true deity , who is a severe God , and persuades him to burn out his eyes . Cain opposes this idea , and says that God himself who had inflicted this punishment upon him , had done it because he neglected to make a proper use of his senses , etc . The evil spirit answers him that God is indeed a God of mercy , and that an example must be given to mankind , that this end will be answered by his terrible appearance , at the same time he will be gratified with the most delicious sights and feelings . Cain , over-persuaded , consents to do it , but wishes to go to the top of the rocks to take a farewell of the earth . His farewell speech concluding with an abrupt address to the promised redeemer , and he abandons the idea on which the being had accompanied him , and turning round to declare this to the being he sees him dancing from rock to rock in his former shape down those interminable precipices .</p>
   <p>‘ Child affeared by his father 's ravings , goes out to pluck the fruits in the moonlight wildness . Cain 's soliloquy . Child returns with a pitcher of water and a cake . Cain wonders what kind of beings dwell in that place — whether any created since man or whether this world had any beings rescued from the Chaos , wandering like shipwrecked beings from another world etc .</p>
   <p>‘ Midnight on the Euphrates . Cedars , palms , pines . Cain discovered sitting on the upper part of the ragged rock , where is cavern overlooking the Euphrates , the moon rising on the horizon . His soliloquy . The Beasts are out on the ramp — he hears the screams of a woman and children surrounded by tigers . Cain makes a soliloquy debating whether he shall save the woman . Cain advances , wishing death , and the tigers rush off . It proves to be Cain 's wife with her two children , determined to follow her husband . She prevails upon him at last to tell his story . Cain 's wife tells him that her son Enoch was placed suddenly by her side . Cain addresses all the elements to cease for a while to persecute him , while he tells his story . He begins with telling her that he had first after his leaving her found out a dwelling in the desart under a juniper tree etc ., etc ., how he meets in the desart a young man whom upon a nearer approach he perceives to be Abel , on whose countenance appears marks of the greatest misery . . . of another being who had power after this life , greater than Jehovah . He is going to offer sacrifices to this being , and persuades Cain to follow him — he comes to an immense gulph filled with water , whither they descend followed by alligators etc . They go till they come to an immense meadow so surrounded as to be inaccessible , and from its depth so vast that you could not see it from above . Abel offers sacrifice from the blood of his arm . A gleam of light illumines the meadow — the countenance of Abel becomes more beautiful , and his arms glistering — he then persuades Cain to offer sacrifice , for himself and his son Enoch by cutting his child 's arm and letting the blood fall from it . Cain is about to do it when Abel himself in his angelic appearance , attended by Michael , is seen in the heavens , whence they sail slowly down . Abel addresses Cain with terror , warning him not to offer up his innocent child . The evil spirit throws off the countenance of Abel , assumes its own shape , flies off pursuing a flying battle with Michael . Abel carries off the child . ’</p>

In Chapter XIV of the Biographia Literaria , 1817 , ii . 3 Coleridge synchronizes the Dark Ladié ( a poem which he was ‘ preparing ’ with the Christabel ) . It would seem probable that it belongs to the spring or early summer of 1798 , and that it was anterior to Love , which was first published in the Morning Post , December 21 , 1799 , under the heading ‘ Introduction to the Tale of the Dark Ladié ’ . If the MS . List of Poems is the record of poems actually written , two-thirds of the Dark Ladié must have perished long before 1817 , when Sibylline Leaves was passing through the press , and it was found necessary to swell the Contents with ‘ two School-boy Poems ’ and ‘ with a song modernized with some additions from one of our elder poets ’ .</p>

   <p>KUBLA KHAN [ 295 : 1 ]:</p>
   <p>OR , A VISION IN A DREAM . A FRAGMENT .</p>
   <p>The following fragment is here published at the request of a poet of great and deserved celebrity [ Lord Byron ] , and , as far as the Author 's own opinions are concerned , rather as a psychological curiosity , than on the ground of any supposed poetic merits . 5</p>
   <p>In the summer of the year 1797 [ 295 : 2 ] , the Author , then in ill health , had retired to a lonely farm-house between Porlock and Linton , on the Exmoor confines of Somerset and Devonshire . In consequence of a slight indisposition , an anodyne had been prescribed , from the effects of which he fell asleep 10 in his chair at the moment that he was reading the following sentence , or words of the same substance , in ‘ Purchas 's Pilgrimage ': ‘ Here the Khan Kubla commanded a palace to be built , and a stately garden thereunto . And thus ten miles of fertile ground were inclosed with a wall . '[ 296 : 1 ] The Author continued for about three hours in a profound sleep , at least of the external senses , during which time he has the most vivid confidence , that he could not have composed less than from two to three hundred lines ; if that indeed can be called composition in which all the images rose up before 20 him as things , with a parallel production of the correspondent expressions , without any sensation or consciousness of effort . On awaking he appeared to himself to have a distinct recollection of the whole , and taking his pen , ink , and paper , instantly and eagerly wrote down the lines that are here preserved . At this moment he was unfortunately called out by a person on business from Porlock , and detained by him above an hour , and on his return to his room , found , to his no small surprise and mortification , that though he still retained some vague and dim recollection of the general purport of the vision , yet , 30 with the exception of some eight or ten scattered lines and images , all the rest had passed away like the images on the surface of a stream into which a stone has been cast , but , alas ! without the after restoration of the latter !</p>

   <p>Yet from the still surviving recollections in his mind , the Author has frequently purposed to finish for himself what had been originally , as it were , given to him . Σαμερον αδιον ασω [ 297 : 1 ] [ Αὔριον ἅδιον ἄσω 1834 ]: but the to-morrow is yet to come .</p>
   <p>As a contrast to this vision , I have annexed a fragment of a very different character , describing with equal fidelity the 50 dream of pain and disease . [ 297 : 2 ]</p>

   <p>[ 295 : 2 ] There can be little doubt that Coleridge should have written ‘ the summer of 1798 ’ . In an unpublished MS. note dated November 3 , 1810 , he connects the retirement between ‘ Linton and Porlock ’ and a recourse to opium with his quarrel with Charles Lloyd , and consequent distress of mind . That quarrel was at its height in May 1798 . He alludes to distress of mind arising from ‘ calumny and ingratitude from men who have been fostered in the bosom of my confidence ’ in a letter to J. P. Estlin , dated May 14 , 1798 ; and , in a letter to Charles Lamb , dated [ Spring ] 1798 , he enlarges on his quarrel with Lloyd and quotes from Lloyd 's novel of Edmund Oliver which was published in 1798 . See Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge , 1895 , i . 245 , note 1 . I discovered and read for the first time the unpublished note of November 3 , 1810 , whilst the edition of 1893 was in the press , and in a footnote to p. xlii of his Introduction the editor , J. D. Campbell , explains that it is too late to alter the position and date of Kubla Khan , but accepts the later date ( May , 1798 ) on the evidence of the MS. note .</p>

    <head>[ 299 : 1 ] First published in the Morning Post for July 30 , 1798 , with the following title and introduction :— ‘ ORIGINAL POETRY . A TALE . The following amusing Tale gives a very humourous description of the French Revolution , which is represented as an Ox ': included in Annual Anthology , 1800 , and Sibylline Leaves , 1817 ; reprinted in Essays on His Own Times , 1880 , iii 963-9 . First collected in P. and D. W ., 1877-80 . In a copy of the Annual Anthology of 1800 Coleridge writes over against the heading of this poem , ‘ Written when fears were entertained of an invasion , and Mr. Sheridan and Mr. Tierney were absurdly represented as having recanted because to [ The French Revolution (? )] in its origin they , [ having been favourable , changed their opinion when the Revolutionists became unfaithful to their principles (? )] . ’ See Note to P. W ., 1893 .</head>
     <l n="1">The text is that of Sibylline Leaves and Essays on his Own Times .</l>

   <p>[ 302 : 1 ] According to the common superstition there are two ways of fighting with the Devil . You may cut him in half with a straw , or he will vanish if you spit over his horns with a fasting spittle . Note by S. T. C. in M. P. According to the superstition of the West-Countries , if you meet the Devil , you may either cut him in half with a straw , or force him to disappear by spitting over his horns . An . Anth ., S.

     <l n="11">GOSPEL</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <note>This paraphrase , written about the time of Charlemagne , is by no means deficient in occasional passages of considerable poetic merit . There is a flow and a tender enthusiasm in the following lines which even in the translation will not , I flatter myself , fail to interest the reader . Ottfried is describing the circumstances immediately following the birth of our Lord . Most interesting is it to consider the effect when the feelings are wrought above the natural pitch by the belief of something mysterious , while all the images are purely natural . Then it is that religion and poetry strike deepest . Biog . Lit ., 1817 , i . 203-4 . [ 306 : 1</note>

    <head>[ 319 : 1 ] First published in the Morning Post , September 6 , 1799 : included in 1828 , 1829 , and 1834 . It is printed separately as the Devil 's Walk , a Poem , By Professor Porson , London , Marsh and Miller , &amp; c ., 1830 . In 1827 , by way of repudiating Porson 's alleged authorship of The Devil 's Thoughts , Southey expanded the Devil 's Thoughts of 1799 into a poem of fifty-seven stanzas entitled The Devil 's Walk . See P. W ., 1838 , iii . pp . 87-100 . In the Morning Post the poem numbered fourteen stanzas ; in 1828 , 1829 it is reduced to ten , and in 1834 enlarged to seventeen stanzas . Stanzas iii and xiv-xvi of the text are not in the M. P. Stanzas iv and v appeared as iii , iv ; stanza vi as ix ; stanza vii as v ; stanza viii as x ; stanza ix as viii ; stanza x as vi ; stanza xi as vii ; stanza xvii as xiv . In 1828 , 1829 , the poem consists of stanzas i-ix of the text , and of the concluding stanzas stanza xi ( ‘ Old Nicholas ’ , &amp; c .) of the M. P. version was not reprinted . Stanzas xiv-xvi of the text were first acknowledged by Coleridge in 1834 .</head>

   <p>[ 321 : 1 ] This anecdote is related by that most interesting of the Devil 's Biographers , Mr. John Milton , in his Paradise Lost , and we have here the Devil 's own testimony to the truth and accuracy of it . M. P .</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The allegory here is so apt , that in a catalogue of various readings obtained from collating the MSS . one might expect to find it noted , that for ‘ LIFE ’ Cod . quid . habent , ‘ TRADE . ’ Though indeed THE TRADE , i. e. the bibliopolic , so called κατ ’ ἐξοχήν , may be regarded as LIFE sensu eminentiori ; a suggestion , which I owe to a young retailer in the hosiery line , who on hearing a description of the net profits , dinner parties , country houses , etc ., of the trade , exclaimed , ‘ Ay ! that 's what I call LIFE now ! ’ — This ‘ Life , our Death , ’ is thus happily contrasted with the fruits of Authorship .— Sic nos non nobis mellificamus Apes .</p>
   <p>Of this poem , which with the ‘ Fire , Famine , and Slaughter ’ first appeared in the Morning Post [ 6th Sept. 1799 ] , the 1st , 2nd , 3rd , 9th , and 16th stanzas [ 321 : A ] were dictated by Mr. Southey . See Apologetic Preface [ to Fire , Famine and Slaughter ] . [ Between the ninth and the concluding stanza , two or three are omitted , as grounded on subjects which have lost their interest — and for better reasons . 1828 , 1829 . ]</p>
   <p>If any one should ask who General —— meant , the Author begs leave to inform him , that he did once see a red-faced person in a dream whom by the dress he took for a General ; but he might have been mistaken , and most certainly he did not hear any names mentioned . In simple verity , the author never meant any one , or indeed any thing but to put a concluding stanza to his doggerel .</p>
   <p>[ 321 : A ] The three first stanzas , which are worth all the rest , and the ninth 1828 , 1829 .</p>
   <p>[ 323 : 1 ] In a MS. copy in the B. M. and in some pirated versions the blank is filled up by the word ‘ Gascoigne 's ’ ; but in a MS. copy taken at Highgate , in June , 1820 , by Derwent Coleridge the line runs ‘ General Tarleton 's ’ , &amp; c .</p>

   <p>[ 324 : 1 ] First published in the Morning Post , September 24 , 1799 : included in Sibylline Leaves , 1817 , 1828 , 1829 , and 1834 . There is no evidence as to the date of composition . In a letter to Coleridge , dated July 5 , 1796 , Lamb writes ‘ Have a care , good Master Poet , of the Statute de Contumeliâ . What do you mean by calling Madame Mara harlots and naughty things ? The goodness of the verse would not save you in a Court of Justice ’ — but it is by no means certain that Lamb is referring to the Lines Composed in a Concert-Room , or that there is any allusion in line 3 to Madame Mara . If , as J. D. Campbell suggested , the poem as it appeared in the Morning Post is a recast of some earlier verses , it is possible that the scene is Ottery , and that ‘ Edmund ’ is the ‘ Friend who died dead of ’ a ‘ Frenzy Fever ’ ( vide ante , p. 76 ) . In this case a probable date would be the summer of 1793 . But the poem as a whole suggests a later date . Coleridge and Southey spent some weeks at Exeter in September 1799 . They visited Ottery St. Mary , and walked through Newton Abbot to Ashburton and Dartmouth . It is possible that the ‘ Concert-Room , ’ the ‘ pert Captain , ’ and ‘ primmer Priest ’ are reminiscences of Exeter , the ‘ heath-plant , ’ and the ‘ ocean caves ’ of Dartmoor and Torbay . If so , the ‘ shame and absolute rout ’ ( l. 49 of variant , p. 325 ) would refer to the victory of Suwaroff over Joubert at Novi , which took place August 15 , 1799 . See Letters of S. T. C ., 1895 , i . 307 .</p>

    <head>[ 327 : 1 ] First published in Friendship 's Offering , 1834 , pp . 165-7 , with other pieces , under the general heading :— Fragments from the Wreck of Memory : or Portions of Poems composed in Early Manhood : by S. T. Coleridge . A Note was prefixed :— ‘ It may not be without use or interest to youthful , and especially to intelligent female readers of poetry , to observe that in the attempt to adapt the Greek metres to the English language , we must begin by substituting quality of sound for quantity — that is , accentuated or comparatively emphasized syllables , for what in the Greek and Latin Verse , are named long , and of which the prosodial mark is ¯; and vice versâ , unaccented syllables for short marked ˘. Now the Hexameter verse consists of two sorts of feet , the spondee composed of two long syllables , and the dactyl , composed of one long syllable followed by two short . The following verse from the Psalms is a rare instance of a perfect hexameter ( i. e. line of six feet ) in the English language :—</head>
     <l n="1">Gōd cāme | ūp wĭth ă | shōut : oūr | Lōrd wĭth thĕ | sōund ŏf ă |</l>
     <l n="2">trūmpĕt .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But so few are the truly spondaic words in our language , such as Ēgȳpt , ūprŏar , tūrmoĭl , &amp; c ., that we are compelled to substitute , in most instances , the trochee ; or ¯ ˘, i. e. in such words as mērry ̆, līghtly ̆, &amp; c ., for the proper spondee . It need only be added , that in the hexameter the fifth foot must be a dactyl , and the sixth a spondee , or trochee . I will end this note with two hexameter lines , likewise from the Psalms :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Thēre ĭs ă | rīvĕr thĕ | flōwĭng whĕre | ōf shāll | glāddĕn thĕ | cīty ̆,</l>
     <l n="2">Hāllē | lūjăh thĕ | cīty ̆ | Gōd Jē | hōvăh hăth | blēst hĕr .</l>

   <p>S. T. C . ’</p>
   <p>On some proof-sheets , or loose pages of a copy of The Hymn as published in Friendship 's Offering for 1834 , which Coleridge annotated , no doubt with a view to his corrections being adopted in the forthcoming edition of his poems ( 1834 ) , he adds in MS. the following supplementary note :— ‘ To make any considerable number of Hexameters feasible in our monosyllabic trocheeo-iambic language , there must , I fear , be other licenses granted — in the first foot , at least — ex . gr . a superfluous ˘ prefixed in cases of particles such as ‘ of , ‘ and ’ , and the like : likewise ¯ ˘ ¯ where the stronger accent is on the first syllable .— S .

Freiligrath 's Biographical Memoirs prefixed to the Tauchnitz edition of the Poems published in 1852 . ) The translation exceeds the German original by two lines . The Hexameters ‘ from the Psalms ’ are taken from a metrical experiment which Coleridge sent to his brother George , in a letter dated September 29 , 1799 ( vide ante ) . First collected in 1834 . The acknowledgement that the Hymn to the Earth is imitated from Stolberg 's Hymne an die Erde was first prefixed by J. D. Campbell in 1893 .</p>

    <head>[ 330 : 1 ] First published ( with four preliminary and three concluding stanzas ) as the Introduction to the Tale of the Dark Ladie , in the Morning Post , Dec. 21 , 1799 ( for complete text with introductory letter vide Appendices ): included ( as Love ) in the Lyrical Ballads of 1800 , 1802 , 1805 : reprinted with the text of the Morning Post in English Minstrelsy , 1810 ( ii . 131-9 ) with the following prefatory note :— ‘ These exquisite stanzas appeared some years ago in a London Newspaper , and have since that time been republished in Mr. Wordsworth 's Lyrical Ballads , but with some alterations ; the Poet having apparently relinquished his intention of writing the Fate of the Dark Ladye ': included ( as Love ) in Sibylline Leaves , 1828 , 1829 , and 1834 . The four opening and three concluding stanzas with prefatory note were republished in Literary Remains , 1836 , pp . 50-2 , and were first collected in 1844 . For a facsimile of the MS. of Love as printed in the Lyrical Ballads , 1800 ( i . 138-44 ) , see Wordsworth and Coleridge MSS ., edited by W. Hale White , 1897 ( between pp . 34-5 ) .

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">It is probable that the greater part of the Introduction to the Tale of</l>
     <l n="2">the Dark Ladie was written either during or shortly after a visit which</l>
     <l n="3">Coleridge paid to the Wordsworths 's friends , George and Mary , and Sarah</l>
     <l n="4">Hutchinson , at Sockburn , a farm-house on the banks of the Tees , in</l>
     <l n="5">November , 1799 . In the first draft , ll . 13-16 , ‘ She leaned , &amp; c . ’ runs</l>
     <l n="6">thus :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">She lean 'd against a grey stone rudely carv 'd ,</l>
     <l n="8">The statue of an arméd Knight :</l>
     <l n="9">She lean 'd in melancholy mood</l>
     <l n="10">Amid the lingering light .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In the church at Sockburn there is a recumbent statue of an ‘ armed knight ’ ( of the Conyers family ) , and in a field near the farm-house there is a ‘ Grey-Stone ’ which is said to commemorate the slaying of a monstrous wyverne or ‘ worme ’ by the knight who is buried in the church . It is difficult to believe that the ‘ arméd knight ’ and the ‘ grey stone ’ of the first draft were not suggested by the statue in Sockburn Church , and the ‘ Grey-Stone ’ in the adjoining field . It has been argued that the Ballad of the Dark Ladié , of which only a fragment remains , was written after Coleridge returned from Germany , and that the Introduction to the Tale of the Dark Ladie , which embodies Love , was written at Stowey in 1797 or 1798 . But in referring to ‘ the plan ’ of the Lyrical Ballads of 1798 ( Biog . Lit ., 1817 , Cap . XIV , ii . 3 ) Coleridge says that he had written the Ancient Mariner , and was preparing the Dark Ladie and the Christabel ( both unpublished poems when this Chapter was written ) , but says nothing of so typical a poem as Love . By the Dark Ladié he must have meant the unfinished Ballad of the Dark Ladié , which , at one time , numbered 190 lines , not the Introduction to the Tale of the Dark Ladie , which later on he refers to as the ‘ poem entitled Love ’ ( Biog . Lit ., 1817 , Cap . XXIV , ii . 298 ) , and which had appeared under that title in the Lyrical Ballads of 1800 , 1802 , and 1805 .</p>
   <p>In Sibylline Leaves , 1828 , 1829 , and 1834 , Love , which was the first in order of a group of poems with the sub-title ‘ Love Poems ’ , was prefaced by the following motto :—</p>
   <p>Quas humilis tenero stylus olim effudit in aevo , Perlegis hic lacrymas , et quod pharetratus acuta Ille puer puero fecit mihi cuspide vulnus . Omnia paulatim consumit longior aetas , Vivendoque simul morimur , rapimurque manendo . Ipse mihi collatus enim non ille videbor : Frons alia est , moresque alii , nova mentis imago , Voxque aliud sonat — Pectore nunc gelido calidos miseremur amantes , Jamque arsisse pudet . Veteres tranquilla tumultus Mens horret , relegensque alium putat ista locutum . PETRARCH .</p>

   <p>MR. EDITOR ,— An unmetrical letter from Talleyrand to Lord Grenville has already appeared , and from an authority too high to be questioned : otherwise I could adduce some arguments for the exclusive authenticity of the following metrical epistle . The very epithet which the wise ancients used , ‘ aurea carmina , ’ might have been supposed likely to have determined the choice of the French minister in favour of verse ; and the rather when we recollect that this phrase of ‘ golden verses ’ is applied emphatically to the works of that philosopher who imposed silence on all with whom he had to deal . Besides is it not somewhat improbable that Talleyrand should have preferred prose to rhyme , when the latter alone has got the chink ? Is it not likewise curious that in our official answer no notice whatever is taken of the Chief Consul , Bonaparte , as if there had been no such person [ man Essays , &amp; c ., 1850 ] existing ; notwithstanding that his existence is pretty generally admitted , nay that some have been so rash as to believe that he has created as great a sensation in the world as Lord Grenville , or even the Duke of Portland ? But the Minister of Foreign Affairs , Talleyrand , is acknowledged , which , in our opinion , could not have happened had he written only that insignificant prose-letter , which seems to precede Bonaparte 's , as in old romances a dwarf always ran before to proclaim the advent or arrival of knight or giant . That Talleyrand 's character and practices more resemble those of some regular Governments than Bonaparte 's I admit ; but this of itself does not appear a satisfactory explanation . However , let the letter speak for itself . The second line is supererogative in syllables , whether from the oscitancy of the transcriber , or from the trepidation which might have overpowered the modest Frenchman , on finding himself in the act of writing to so great a man , I shall not dare to determine . A few Notes are added by Your servant , GNOME .</p>

    <head>[ 341 : 1 ] This sarcasm on the writings of moralists is , in general , extremely just ; but had Talleyrand continued long enough in England , he might have found an honourable exception in the second volume of Dr. Paley 's Moral Philosophy ; in which both Secret Influence , and all the other Established Forms , are justified and placed in their true light .</head>

   <p>[ 342 : 3 ] The word Initiations is borrowed from the new Constitution , and can only mean , in plain English , introductory matter . If the manuscript would bear us out , we should propose to read the line thus : ‘ What a plentiful Verbage , what Initiations ! ’ inasmuch as Vintage must necessarily refer to wine , really or figuratively ; and we cannot guess what species Lord Grenville 's eloquence may be supposed to resemble , unless , indeed , it be Cowslip wine . A slashing critic to whom we read the manuscript , proposed to read , ‘ What a plenty of Flowers — what initiations ! ’ and supposes it may allude indiscriminately to Poppy Flowers , or Flour of Brimstone . The most modest emendation , perhaps , would be this — for Vintage read Ventage .</p>
   <p>[ 343 : 1 ] We cannot sufficiently admire the accuracy of this simile . For as Lord Grenville , though short , is certainly not the shortest man in the House , even so is it with the days in November .</p>
   <p>[ 343 : 2 ] An evident plagiarism of the Ex-Bishop 's from Dr. Johnson :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Existence saw him spurn her bounded reign ,</l>
     <l n="2">And panting Time toil 'd after him in vain :</l>

   </lg>
   <p>[ 343 : 3 ] This line and the following are involved in an almost Lycophrontic tenebricosity . On repeating them , however , to an Illuminant , whose confidence I possess , he informed me ( and he ought to know , for he is a Tallow-chandler by trade ) that certain candles go by the name of sixteens . This explains the whole , the Scotch Peers are destined to burn out — and so are candles ! The English are perpetual , and are therefore styled Fixed Stars ! The word Geminies is , we confess , still obscure to us ; though we venture to suggest that it may perhaps be a metaphor ( daringly sublime ) for the two eyes which noble Lords do in general possess . It is certainly used by the poet Fletcher in this sense , in the 31st stanza of his Purple Island :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ What ! shall I then need seek a patron out ,</l>
     <l n="2">Or beg a favour from a mistress ’ eyes ,</l>

   <p>[ 347 : 1 ] First published in the Amulet , 1833 , reprinted in Friendship 's Offering , 1834 : included in Essays on His Own Times , 1850 , iii . 997 . First collected in P. and D. W ., 1877-80 . These lines are inserted in one of the Malta Notebooks , and appear from the context to have been written at Olevano in 1806 ; but it is almost certain that they belong to the autumn of 1800 when Coleridge made a first acquaintance of ‘ Blencathara 's rugged coves ’ . The first line is an adaptation of a line in a poem of Isaac Ritson , quoted in Hutchinson 's History of Cumberland , a work which supplied him with some of the place-names in the Second Part of Christabel . Compare , too , a sentence in a letter to Sir H. Davy of Oct. 18 , 1800 :— ‘ At the bottom of the Carrock Man . . . the wind became so fearful and tyrannous , etc . ’</p>

   <p>[ 353 : 2 ] First published in the Morning Post , December 4 , 1800 : reprinted in Fraser 's Magazine both in February and in May , 1833 , and in Payne Collier 's Old Man 's Diary , i . 35 . First collected in P. W ., 1834 , with the following Prefatory Note :— ‘ See the apology for the “ Fire , Famine , and Slaughter ” , in first volume . This is the first time the author ever published these lines . He would have been glad , had they perished ; but they have now been printed repeatedly in magazines , and he is told that the verses will not perish . Here , therefore , they are owned , with a hope that they will be taken — as assuredly they were composed — in mere sport . ’ These lines , which were directed against Sir James Mackintosh , were included in a letter to [ Sir ] Humphry Davy , dated October 9 , 1800 . There is a MS. version in the British Museum in the handwriting of R. Heber , presented by him to J. Mitford . Mr. Campbell questions the accuracy of Coleridge 's statement with regard to his never having published the poem on his own account . But it is possible that Davy may have sent the lines to the Press without Coleridge 's authority . Daniel Stuart , the Editor of the Morning Post , in the Gentleman 's Magazine for May , 1838 , says that ‘ Coleridge sent one [ poem ] attacking Mackintosh , too obviously for me not to understand it , and of course it was not published . Mackintosh had had one of his front teeth broken and the stump was black ’ . Stuart remembered that the lines attacking his brother-in-law had been suppressed , but forgot that he had inserted the rest of the poem . The poem as printed in 1893 , despite the heading , does not follow the text of the Morning Post .</p>

Sotheby , dated Keswick , July 19 , 1802 ( Letters of S. T. C ., 1895 , i . 379-84 ) . Two other MS. versions are preserved at Coleorton ( P. W. of W. Wordsworth , ed . by William Knight , 1896 , iii . App ., pp . 400 , 401 ) . Lines 37 , 38 were quoted by Coleridge in the Historie and Gests of Maxilian ( first published in Blackwood 's Edinburgh Magazine for January , 1822 , and reprinted in Miscellanies , &amp; c ., ed . by T. Ashe , 1885 , p. 282 ): l. 38 by Wordsworth in his pamphlet on The Convention of Cintra , 1809 , p. 135 : lines 47-75 , followed by lines 29-38 , were quoted by Coleridge in Essays on the Fine Arts , No . III ( which were first published in Felix Farley 's Bristol Journal , Sept. 10 , 1814 , and reprinted by Cottle , E. R ., 1837 , ii . 201-40 ) ; and lines 21-28 , ibid ., in illustration of the following Scholium :— ‘ We have sufficiently distinguished the beautiful from the agreeable , by the sure criterion , that when we find an object agreeable , the sensation of pleasure always precedes the judgment , and is its determining cause . We find it agreeable . But when we declare an object beautiful , the contemplation or intuition of its beauty precedes the feeling of complacency , in order of nature at least : nay in great depression of spirits may even exist without sensibly producing it . ’ Lines 76-93 are quoted in a letter to Southey of July 29 , 1802 ; lines 76-83 are quoted in a letter to Allsop , September 30 , 1819 , Letters , &amp; c ., 1836 , i . 17 . Lines 80 , 81 are quoted in the Biographia Literaria , 1817 , ii . 182 , and lines 87-93 in a letter to Josiah Wedgwood , dated October 20 , 1802 : see Cottle 's Rem ., 1848 , p. 44 , and Tom Wedgwood by R. B. Litchfield , 1903 , pp . 114 , 115 .</p>

O Edmund , friend of my devoutest choice , O rais 'd from anxious dread and busy care , By the immenseness of the good and fair Which thou see'st everywhere , 5 Joy lifts thy spirit , joy attunes thy voice , To thee do all things live from pole to pole , Their life the eddying of thy living soul ! O simple Spirit , guided from above , O lofty Poet , full of life and love , 10 Brother and Friend of my devoutest choice , Thus may'st thou ever , evermore rejoice ! ΕΣΤΗΣΕ .</p>

    <head>THE PICTURE [ 369 : 1 ]</head>
    <head>OR THE LOVER 'S RESOLUTION</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Through weeds and thorns , and matted underwood</l>
     <l n="2">I force my way ; now climb , and now descend</l>
     <l n="3">O'er rocks , or bare or mossy , with wild foot</l>
     <l n="4">Crushing the purple whorts ; [ 369 : 2 ] while oft unseen ,</l>
     <l n="5">Hurrying along the drifted forest-leaves , 5</l>
     <l n="6">The scared snake rustles . Onward still I toil ,</l>
     <l n="7">I know not , ask not whither ! A new joy ,</l>
     <l n="8">Lovely as light , sudden as summer gust ,</l>
     <l n="9">And gladsome as the first-born of the spring ,</l>
     <l n="10">Beckons me on , or follows from behind , 10</l>
     <l n="11">Playmate , or guide ! The master-passion quelled ,</l>
     <l n="12">I feel that I am free . With dun-red bark</l>
     <l n="13">The fir-trees , and the unfrequent slender oak ,</l>
     <l n="14">Forth from this tangle wild of bush and brake</l>
     <l n="15">Soar up , and form a melancholy vault 15</l>
     <l n="16">High o'er me , murmuring like a distant sea .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="17">Here Wisdom might resort , and here Remorse ;</l>
     <l n="18">Here too the love-lorn man , who , sick in soul ,</l>
     <l n="19">And of this busy human heart aweary ,</l>
     <l n="20">Worships the spirit of unconscious life 20</l>
     <l n="21">In tree or wild-flower .— Gentle lunatic !</l>
     <l n="22">If so he might not wholly cease to be ,</l>
     <l n="23">He would far rather not be that he is ;</l>
     <l n="24">But would be something that he knows not of ,</l>
     <l n="25">In winds or waters , or among the rocks ! 25</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="26">But hence , fond wretch ! breathe not contagion here !</l>
     <l n="27">No myrtle-walks are these : these are no groves</l>
     <l n="28">Where Love dare loiter ! If in sullen mood</l>
     <l n="29">He should stray hither , the low stumps shall gore</l>
     <l n="30">His dainty feet , the briar and the thorn 30</l>
     <l n="31">Make his plumes haggard . Like a wounded bird</l>
     <l n="32">Easily caught , ensnare him , O ye Nymphs ,</l>
     <l n="33">Ye Oreads chaste , ye dusky Dryades !</l>
     <l n="34">And you , ye Earth-winds ! you that make at morn</l>
     <l n="35">The dew-drops quiver on the spiders ’ webs ! 35</l>
     <l n="36">You , O ye wingless Airs ! that creep between</l>
     <l n="37">The rigid stems of heath and bitten furze ,</l>
     <l n="38">Within whose scanty shade , at summer-noon ,</l>
     <l n="39">The mother-sheep hath worn a hollow bed —</l>
     <l n="40">Ye , that now cool her fleece with dropless damp , 40</l>
     <l n="41">Now pant and murmur with her feeding lamb .</l>
     <l n="42">Chase , chase him , all ye Fays , and elfin Gnomes !</l>
     <l n="43">With prickles sharper than his darts bemock</l>
     <l n="44">His little Godship , making him perforce</l>
     <l n="45">Creep through a thorn-bush on yon hedgehog 's back . 45</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="46">This is my hour of triumph ! I can now</l>
     <l n="47">With my own fancies play the merry fool ,</l>
     <l n="48">And laugh away worse folly , being free .</l>
     <l n="49">Here will I seat myself , beside this old ,</l>
     <l n="50">Hollow , and weedy oak , which ivy-twine 50</l>
     <l n="51">Clothes as with net-work : here will I couch my limbs ,</l>
     <l n="52">Close by this river , in this silent shade ,</l>
     <l n="53">As safe and sacred from the step of man</l>
     <l n="54">As an invisible world — unheard , unseen ,</l>
     <l n="55">And listening only to the pebbly brook 55</l>
     <l n="56">That murmurs with a dead , yet tinkling sound ;</l>
     <l n="57">Or to the bees , that in the neighbouring trunk</l>
     <l n="58">Make honey-hoards . The breeze , that visits me ,</l>
     <l n="59">Was never Love 's accomplice , never raised</l>
     <l n="60">The tendril ringlets from the maiden 's brow , 60</l>
     <l n="61">And the blue , delicate veins above her cheek ;</l>
     <l n="62">Ne'er played the wanton — never half disclosed</l>
     <l n="63">The maiden 's snowy bosom , scattering thence</l>
     <l n="64">Eye-poisons for some love-distempered youth ,</l>
     <l n="65">Who ne'er henceforth may see an aspen-grove 65</l>
     <l n="66">Shiver in sunshine , but his feeble heart</l>
     <l n="67">Shall flow away like a dissolving thing .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="68">Sweet breeze ! thou only , if I guess aright ,</l>
     <l n="69">Liftest the feathers of the robin 's breast ,</l>
     <l n="70">That swells its little breast , so full of song , 70</l>
     <l n="71">Singing above me , on the mountain-ash .</l>
     <l n="72">And thou too , desert stream ! no pool of thine ,</l>
     <l n="73">Though clear as lake in latest summer-eve ,</l>
     <l n="74">Did e'er reflect the stately virgin 's robe ,</l>
     <l n="75">The face , the form divine , the downcast look 75</l>
     <l n="76">Contemplative ! Behold ! her open palm</l>
     <l n="77">Presses her cheek and brow ! her elbow rests</l>
     <l n="78">On the bare branch of half-uprooted tree ,</l>
     <l n="79">That leans towards its mirror ! Who erewhile</l>
     <l n="80">Had from her countenance turned , or looked by stealth ,</l>
     <l n="81">( For Fear is true-love 's cruel nurse ) , he now 81</l>
     <l n="82">With steadfast gaze and unoffending eye ,</l>
     <l n="83">Worships the watery idol , dreaming hopes</l>
     <l n="84">Delicious to the soul , but fleeting , vain ,</l>
     <l n="85">E'en as that phantom-world on which he gazed , 85</l>
     <l n="86">But not unheeded gazed : for see , ah ! see ,</l>
     <l n="87">The sportive tyrant with her left hand plucks</l>
     <l n="88">The heads of tall flowers that behind her grow ,</l>
     <l n="89">Lychnis , and willow-herb , and fox-glove bells :</l>
     <l n="90">And suddenly , as one that toys with time , 90</l>
     <l n="91">Scatters them on the pool ! Then all the charm</l>
     <l n="92">Is broken — all that phantom world so fair</l>
     <l n="93">Vanishes , and a thousand circlets spread ,</l>
     <l n="94">And each mis-shape the other . Stay awhile ,</l>
     <l n="95">Poor youth , who scarcely dar'st lift up thine eyes ! 95</l>
     <l n="96">The stream will soon renew its smoothness , soon</l>
     <l n="97">The visions will return ! And lo ! he stays :</l>
     <l n="98">And soon the fragments dim of lovely forms</l>
     <l n="99">Come trembling back , unite , and now once more</l>
     <l n="100">The pool becomes a mirror ; and behold 100</l>
     <l n="101">Each wildflower on the marge inverted there ,</l>
     <l n="102">And there the half-uprooted tree — but where ,</l>
     <l n="103">O where the virgin 's snowy arm , that leaned</l>
     <l n="104">On its bare branch ? He turns , and she is gone !</l>
     <l n="105">Homeward she steals through many a woodland maze 105</l>
     <l n="106">Which he shall seek in vain . Ill-fated youth !</l>
     <l n="107">Go , day by day , and waste thy manly prime</l>
     <l n="108">In mad love-yearning by the vacant brook ,</l>
     <l n="109">Till sickly thoughts bewitch thine eyes , and thou</l>
     <l n="110">Behold'st her shadow still abiding there , 110</l>
     <l n="111">The Naiad of the mirror !</l>
     <l n="112">Not to thee ,</l>
     <l n="113">O wild and desert stream ! belongs this tale :</l>
     <l n="114">Gloomy and dark art thou — the crowded firs</l>
     <l n="115">Spire from thy shores , and stretch across thy bed ,</l>
     <l n="116">Making thee doleful as a cavern-well : 115</l>
     <l n="117">Save when the shy king-fishers build their nest</l>
     <l n="118">On thy steep banks , no loves hast thou , wild stream !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="119">This be my chosen haunt — emancipate</l>
     <l n="120">From Passion 's dreams , a freeman , and alone ,</l>
     <l n="121">I rise and trace its devious course . O lead , 120</l>
     <l n="122">Lead me to deeper shades and lonelier glooms .</l>
     <l n="123">Lo ! stealing through the canopy of firs ,</l>
     <l n="124">How fair the sunshine spots that mossy rock ,</l>
     <l n="125">Isle of the river , whose disparted waves</l>
     <l n="126">Dart off asunder with an angry sound , 125</l>
     <l n="127">How soon to re-unite ! And see ! they meet ,</l>
     <l n="128">Each in the other lost and found : and see</l>
     <l n="129">Placeless , as spirits , one soft water-sun</l>
     <l n="130">Throbbing within them , heart at once and eye !</l>
     <l n="131">With its soft neighbourhood of filmy clouds , 130</l>
     <l n="132">The stains and shadings of forgotten tears ,</l>
     <l n="133">Dimness o'erswum with lustre ! Such the hour</l>
     <l n="134">Of deep enjoyment , following love 's brief feuds ;</l>
     <l n="135">And hark , the noise of a near waterfall !</l>
     <l n="136">I pass forth into light — I find myself 135</l>
     <l n="137">Beneath a weeping birch ( most beautiful</l>
     <l n="138">Of forest trees , the Lady of the Woods ) ,</l>
     <l n="139">Hard by the brink of a tall weedy rock</l>
     <l n="140">That overbrows the cataract . How bursts</l>
     <l n="141">The landscape on my sight ! Two crescent hills 140</l>
     <l n="142">Fold in behind each other , and so make</l>
     <l n="143">A circular vale , and land-locked , as might seem ,</l>
     <l n="144">With brook and bridge , and grey stone cottages ,</l>
     <l n="145">Half hid by rocks and fruit-trees . At my feet ,</l>
     <l n="146">The whortle-berries are bedewed with spray , 145</l>
     <l n="147">Dashed upwards by the furious waterfall .</l>
     <l n="148">How solemnly the pendent ivy-mass</l>
     <l n="149">Swings in its winnow : All the air is calm .</l>
     <l n="150">The smoke from cottage-chimneys , tinged with light ,</l>
     <l n="151">Rises in columns ; from this house alone , 150</l>
     <l n="152">Close by the water-fall , the column slants ,</l>
     <l n="153">And feels its ceaseless breeze . But what is this ?</l>
     <l n="154">That cottage , with its slanting chimney-smoke ,</l>
     <l n="155">And close beside its porch a sleeping child ,</l>
     <l n="156">His dear head pillowed on a sleeping dog — 155</l>
     <l n="157">One arm between its fore-legs , and the hand</l>
     <l n="158">Holds loosely its small handful of wild-flowers ,</l>
     <l n="159">Unfilletted , and of unequal lengths .</l>
     <l n="160">A curious picture , with a master 's haste</l>
     <l n="161">Sketched on a strip of pinky-silver skin , 160</l>
     <l n="162">Peeled from the birchen bark ! Divinest maid !</l>
     <l n="163">Yon bark her canvas , and those purple berries</l>
     <l n="164">Her pencil ! See , the juice is scarcely dried</l>
     <l n="165">On the fine skin ! She has been newly here ;</l>
     <l n="166">And lo ! yon patch of heath has been her couch — 165</l>
     <l n="167">The pressure still remains ! O blesséd couch !</l>
     <l n="168">For this may'st thou flower early , and the sun ,</l>
     <l n="169">Slanting at eve , rest bright , and linger long</l>
     <l n="170">Upon thy purple bells ! O Isabel !</l>
     <l n="171">Daughter of genius ! stateliest of our maids ! 170</l>
     <l n="172">More beautiful than whom Alcaeus wooed ,</l>
     <l n="173">The Lesbian woman of immortal song !</l>
     <l n="174">O child of genius ! stately , beautiful ,</l>
     <l n="175">And full of love to all , save only me ,</l>
     <l n="176">And not ungentle e'en to me ! My heart , 175</l>
     <l n="177">Why beats it thus ? Through yonder coppice-wood</l>
     <l n="178">Needs must the pathway turn , that leads straightway</l>
     <l n="179">On to her father 's house . She is alone !</l>
     <l n="180">The night draws on — such ways are hard to hit —</l>
     <l n="181">And fit it is I should restore this sketch , 180</l>
     <l n="182">Dropt unawares , no doubt . Why should I yearn</l>
     <l n="183">To keep the relique ? ‘ twill but idly feed</l>
     <l n="184">The passion that consumes me . Let me haste !</l>
     <l n="185">The picture in my hand which she has left ;</l>
     <l n="186">She cannot blame me that I followed her : 185</l>
     <l n="187">And I may be her guide the long wood through .</l>

    <head>TO MATILDA BETHAM FROM A STRANGER [ 374 : 1 ]</head>
    <note>‘ One of our most celebrated poets , who had , I was told , picked out and praised the little piece ‘ On a Cloud , ’ another had quoted ( saying it would have been faultless if I had not used the word Phoebus in it , which he thought inadmissible in modern poetry ) , sent me some verses inscribed “ To Matilda Betham , from a Stranger ” ; and dated “ Keswick , Sept. 9 , 1802 , S. T. C . ” I should have guessed whence they came , but dared not flatter myself so highly as satisfactorily to believe it , before I obtained the avowal of the lady who had transmitted them .

    <head>‘ CHAMOUNI , THE HOUR BEFORE SUNRISE .</head>
    <head>‘ [ Chamouni is one of the highest mountain valleys of the Barony of Faucigny in the Savoy Alps ; and exhibits a kind of fairy world , in which the wildest appearances ( I had almost said horrors ) of Nature alternate with the softest and most beautiful . The chain of Mont Blanc is its boundary ; and besides the Arve it is filled with sounds from the Arveiron , which rushes from the melted glaciers , like a giant , mad with joy , from a dungeon , and forms other torrents of snow-water , having their rise in the glaciers which slope down into the valley . The beautiful Gentiana major , or greater gentian , with blossoms of the brightest blue , grows in large companies a few steps from the never-melted ice of the glaciers . I thought it an affecting emblem of the boldness of human hope , venturing near , and , as it were , leaning over the brink of the grave . Indeed , the whole vale , its every light , its every sound , must needs impress every mind not utterly callous with the thought — Who would be , who could be an Atheist in this valley of wonders ! If any of the readers of the MORNING POST [ Those who have P. R .] have visited this vale in their journeys among the Alps , I am confident that they [ that they om . P.

   <p>[ 382 : 2 ] First published in the Morning Post (? ) , Oct. 7 , 1802 : included in Sibylline Leaves , 1817 : in Literary Remains , 1836 , i . 54-6 . First collected in 1844 . In Literary Remains the poem is dated 1809 , but in a letter to J. Wedgwood , Oct. 20 , 1802 , Coleridge seems to imply that the Ode to the Rain had appeared recently in the Morning Post . A MS. note of Mrs. H. N. Coleridge , included in other memoranda intended for publication in Essays on His Own Times , gives the date , ‘ Ode to Rain , October 7 ’ . The issue for October 7 is missing in the volume for 1802 preserved in the British Museum , and it may be presumed that it was in that number the Ode to the Rain first appeared . It is possible that the ‘ Ode ’ was written on the morning after the unexpected arrival of Charles and Mary Lamb at Greta Hall in August , 1802 .</p>

A note ( p. 384 ) , was affixed :— ‘ This little poem first appeared in the Morning Post in 1802 , but was doubtless composed in Germany . It seems to have been forgotten by its author , for this was the only occasion on which it saw the light through him . The Editors think that it will plead against parental neglect in the mind of most readers . ’ Internal evidence seems to point to 1801 or 1802 as the most probable date of composition .</p>

The first draft immediately follows the transcription of a series of Dante 's Canzoni begun at Malta in 1805 . If the Hexameters were composed at the same time , it is possible that they were inspired by a perusal or re-perusal of a MS. copy of Wordsworth 's unpublished poems which had been made for his use whilst he was abroad . As Mr. Campbell points out ( P. W ., p. 614 ) , Wordsworth himself was responsible for the Latinization of his name .

    <head>[ 393 : 1 ] These lines , without title or heading , are quoted ( ‘ vide . . . my lines ’ ) in an entry in one of Coleridge 's Malta Notebooks , dated Feb. 8 , 1805 , to illustrate the idea that the love-sense can be abstracted from the accidents of form or person ( see Anima Poetae , 1895 , p. 120 ) . It follows that they were written before that date . Phantom was first published in 1834 , immediately following ( ii . 71 ) Phantom or Fact . A dialogue in Verse , which was first published in 1828 , and was probably written about that time . Both poems are ‘ fragments from the life of dreams ’ ; but it was the reality which lay behind both ‘ phantom ’ and ‘ fact ’ of which the poet dreamt , having his eyes open . With lines 4 , 5 compare the following stanza of one of the MS. versions of the Dark Ladié :—</head>

   <p>THE BLOSSOMING OF THE SOLITARY DATE-TREE [ 395 : 1 ]</p>
   <p>A LAMENT</p>
   <p>I seem to have an indistinct recollection of having read either in one of the ponderous tomes of George of Venice , or in some other compilation from the uninspired Hebrew writers , an apologue or Rabbinical tradition to the following purpose :</p>
   <p>While our first parents stood before their offended Maker , and the last 5 words of the sentence were yet sounding in Adam 's ear , the guileful false serpent , a counterfeit and a usurper from the beginning , presumptuously took on himself the character of advocate or mediator , and pretending to intercede for Adam , exclaimed : ‘ Nay , Lord , in thy justice , not so ! for the man was the least in fault . Rather let the Woman return at once to 10 the dust , and let Adam remain in this thy Paradise . ’ And the word of the Most High answered Satan : ‘ The tender mercies of the wicked are cruel . Treacherous Fiend ! if with guilt like thine , it had been possible for thee to have the heart of a Man , and to feel the yearning of a human soul for its counterpart , the sentence , which thou now counsellest , should have 15 been inflicted on thyself . ’</p>
   <p>The title of the following poem was suggested by a fact mentioned by Linnaeus , of a date-tree in a nobleman 's garden which year after year had put forth a full show of blossoms , but never produced fruit , till a branch from another date-tree had been conveyed from a distance of 20 some hundred leagues . The first leaf of the MS. from which the poem has been transcribed , and which contained the two or three introductory stanzas , is wanting : and the author has in vain taxed his memory to repair the loss . But a rude draught of the poem contains the substance of the stanzas , and the reader is requested to receive it as the substitute . 25 It is not impossible , that some congenial spirit , whose years do not exceed those of the Author at the time the poem was written , may find a pleasure in restoring the Lament to its original integrity by a reduction of the thoughts to the requisite metre . S. T. C .</p>
   <p>1</p>
   <p>Beneath the blaze of a tropical sun the mountain peaks are 30 the Thrones of Frost , through the absence of objects to reflect the rays . ‘ What no one with us shares , seems scarce our own . ’ The presence of a ONE ,</p>
   <p>The best belov 'd , who loveth me the best ,</p>
   <p>is for the heart , what the supporting air from within is for the 35 hollow globe with its suspended car . Deprive it of this , and all without , that would have buoyed it aloft even to the seat of the gods , becomes a burthen and crushes it into flatness .</p>
   <p>2</p>
   <p>The finer the sense for the beautiful and the lovely , and the fairer and lovelier the object presented to the sense ; the more 40 exquisite the individual 's capacity of joy , and the more ample his means and opportunities of enjoyment , the more heavily will he feel the ache of solitariness , the more unsubstantial becomes the feast spread around him . What matters it , whether in fact the viands and the ministering graces are 45 shadowy or real , to him who has not hand to grasp nor arms to embrace them ?</p>

    <head>[ 399 : 1 ] Now first printed from one of Coleridge 's Notebooks . The last stanza — the Epilogue — was first published by H. N. Coleridge as part of an ‘ Uncomposed Poem ’ , in Literary Remains , 1836 , i . 52 : first collected in Appendix to P. and D. W ., 1877-80 , ii . 366 . There is no conclusive evidence as to the date of composition . The handwriting , and the contents of the Notebook might suggest a date between 1813 and 1816 . The verses are almost immediately preceded by a detached note printed at the close of an essay entitled ‘ Self-love in Religion ’ which is included among the ‘ Omniana of 1809 ’ , Literary Remains , 1834 , i . 354-6 : ‘ O magical , sympathetic , anima !

     <l n="3">Friend of the wise ! and Teacher of the Good !</l>
     <l n="4">Into my heart have I received that Lay</l>
     <l n="5">More than historic , that prophetic Lay</l>
     <l n="6">Wherein ( high theme by thee first sung aright )</l>
     <l n="7">Of the foundations and the building up 5</l>
     <l n="8">Of a Human Spirit thou hast dared to tell</l>
     <l n="9">What may be told , to the understanding mind</l>
     <l n="10">Revealable ; and what within the mind</l>
     <l n="11">By vital breathings secret as the soul</l>
     <l n="12">Of vernal growth , oft quickens in the heart 10</l>
     <l n="13">Thoughts all too deep for words !—</l>
     <l n="14">Theme hard as high !</l>

     <l n="17">Of tides obedient to external force ,</l>
     <l n="18">And currents self-determined , as might seem , 15</l>
     <l n="19">Or by some inner Power ; of moments awful ,</l>
     <l n="20">Now in thy inner life , and now abroad ,</l>
     <l n="21">When power streamed from thee , and thy soul received</l>
     <l n="22">The light reflected , as a light bestowed —</l>
     <l n="23">Of fancies fair , and milder hours of youth , 20</l>
     <l n="24">Hyblean murmurs of poetic thought</l>

     <l n="30">Of more than Fancy , of the Social Sense</l>

     <l n="33">Like some becalméd bark beneath the burst 30</l>

     <l n="48">Action and joy !— An Orphic song indeed , 45</l>
     <l n="49">A song divine of high and passionate thoughts</l>

This ‘ exquisite fragment . . . was probably composed as the opening of Recollections of Love , and abandoned on account of a change of metre . ’ — Editor 's Note , 1893 ( p. 635 ) . It is in no way a translation , but the thought or idea was suggested by one of the German stanzas which Coleridge selected and copied into one of his Notebooks as models or specimens of various metres .

   <p>[ 409 : 2 ] First published in Sibylline Leaves , 1817 : included in 1828 , 1829 , and 1834 . It is impossible to fix the date of composition , though internal evidence points to July , 1807 , when Coleridge revisited Stowey after a long absence . The first stanza , a variant of the preceding fragment , is introduced into a prose fancy , entitled ‘ Questions and Answers in the Court of Love ’ , of uncertain date , but perhaps written at Malta in 1805 ( vide Appendices of this edition ) . A first draft of stanzas 1-4 ( vide supra ) is included in the collection of metrical experiments and metrical schemes , modelled on German and Italian originals , which seems to have been begun in 1801 , with a view to a projected ‘ Essay on Metre ’ . Stanzas 5 , 6 are not contemporary with stanzas 1-4 , and , perhaps , date from 1814 , 1815 , when Sibylline Leaves were being prepared for the press .</p>

   <p>[ 414 : 2 ] Now published for the first time from one of Coleridge 's Notebooks . The use of the party catchword ‘ Citizen ’ and the allusion to ‘ Folks in France ’ would suggest 1796-7 as a probable date , but the point or interpretation of the ‘ Example ’ was certainly in Coleridge 's mind when he put together the first number of The Friend , published June 1 , 1809 :— ‘ Though all men are in error , they are not all in the same error , nor at the same time . . . each therefore may possibly heal the other . . . even as two or more physicians , all diseased in their general health , yet under the immediate action of the disease on different days , may remove or alleviate the complaints of each other . ’</p>

   <p>[ 419 : 2 ] First published in Sibylline Leaves , 1817 , in the preliminary matter , p. v : included in 1828 , 1829 , and 1834 . In the ‘ Preface ’ to Sibylline Leaves , p. iii , an apology is offered for its insertion on the plea that it was a ‘ school boy poem ’ added ‘ at the request of the friends of my youth ’ . The title is explained as follows :— ‘ By imaginary Time , I meant the state of a school boy 's mind when on his return to school he projects his being in his day dreams , and lives in his next holidays , six months hence ; and this I contrasted with real Time . ’ In a Notebook of (? ) 1811 there is an attempt to analyse and illustrate the ‘ sense of Time ’ , which appears to have been written before the lines as published in Sibylline Leaves took shape : ‘ How marked the contrast between troubled manhood and joyously-active youth in the sense of time ! To the former , time like the sun in an empty sky is never seen to move , but only to have moved . There , there it was , and now ‘ tis here , now distant ! yet all a blank between . To the latter it is as the full moon in a fine breezy October night , driving on amid clouds of all shapes and hues , and kindling shifting colours , like an ostrich in its speed , and yet seems not to have moved at all . This I feel to be a just image of time real and time as felt , in two different states of being . The title of the poem therefore ( for poem it ought to be ) should be time real and time felt ( in the sense of time ) in active youth , or activity with hope and fullness of aim in any period , and in despondent , objectless manhood — time objective and subjective . ’ Anima Poetae , 1895 , pp . 241-2 .</p>

The so-called ‘ Ne Plus Ultra ’ may have been intended to illustrate a similar paradox — the ‘ positivity of negation ’ . No date can be assigned to either of these metaphysical conceits , but there can be little doubt that they were ‘ written in later life ’ .</p>

    <head>[ 432 : 1 ] First published in P. W ., 1834 . Gillman ( Life , p. 276 ) says that the lines were composed ‘ as an experiment for a metre ’ , and repeated by the author to ‘ a mutual friend ’ , who ‘ spoke of his visit to Highgate ’ and repeated them to Scott on the following day . The last three lines , ‘ somewhat altered ’ , are quoted in Ivanhoe , chapter viii , and again in Castle Dangerous , chapter ix . They run thus :—</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The knights are dust ,</l>
     <l n="2">And their good swords are rust ;—</l>
     <l n="3">Their souls are with the saints , we trust .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">Gillman says that the Ivanhoe quotation convinced Coleridge that Scott</l>
     <l n="5">was the author of the Waverley Novels . In the Appendix to the ‘ Notes ’ to</l>
     <l n="6">Castle Dangerous ( 1834 ) , which was edited and partly drawn up by</l>
     <l n="7">Lockhart , the poem is quoted in full , with a prefatory note ( ‘ The author</l>
     <l n="8">has somewhat altered part of a beautiful unpublished fragment of</l>
     <l n="9">Coleridge ’ ) .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="10">Where is the grave of Sir Arthur Orellan ,—</l>
     <l n="11">Where may the grave of that good knight be ?</l>
     <l n="12">By the marge of a brook , on the slope of Helvellyn ,</l>
     <l n="13">Under the boughs of a young birch-tree .</l>
     <l n="14">The Oak that in summer was pleasant to hear ,</l>
     <l n="15">That rustled in autumn all wither 'd and sear ,</l>
     <l n="16">That whistled and groan 'd thro ’ the winter alone ,</l>
     <l n="17">He hath gone , and a birch in his place is grown .</l>
     <l n="18">The knight 's bones are dust ,</l>
     <l n="19">His good sword is rust ;</l>
     <l n="20">His spirit is with the saints , we trust .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>This version must have been transcribed from a MS. in Lockhart 's possession , and represents a first draft of the lines as published in 1834 . These lines are , no doubt , an ‘ experiment for a metre ’ . The upward movement ( ll . 1-7 ) is dactylic : the fall ( ll . 8-11 ) is almost , if not altogether , spondaic . The whole forms a complete stanza , or metrical scheme , which may be compared with ll . 264-78 of the First Part of Christabel . Mrs. H. N. Coleridge , who must have been familiar with Gillman 's story , dates the Knight 's Tomb 1802 .</p>

    <head>[ 439 : 1 ] First published in its present shape in 1834 . Lines 1-38 , with the heading ‘ Youth and Age ’ , were first published in the Literary Souvenir , 1828 , and also in the Bijou , 1828 : included in 1828 , 1829 . Lines 39-49 were first published in Blackwood 's Magazine for June 1832 , entitled ‘ An Old Man 's Sigh : a Sonnet ’ , as ‘ an out-slough or hypertrophic stanza of a certain poem called “ Youth and Age ” . ’ Of lines 1-43 three MSS . are extant . ( 1 ) A fair copy ( MS. 1 ) presented to Derwent Coleridge , and now in the Editor 's possession . In MS. 1 the poem is divided into three stanzas : ( i ) lines 1-17 ; ( ii ) lines 18-38 ; ( iii ) lines 39-43 . The watermark of this MS. on a quarto sheet of Bath Post letter-paper is 1822 . ( 2 ) A rough draft , in a notebook dated Sept. 10 , 1823 ; and ( 3 ) a corrected draft of forty-three lines ( vide for MSS . 2 , 3 Appendices of this edition ) . A MS. version of An Old Man 's Sigh , dated ‘ Grove , Highgate , April 1832 ’ , was contributed to Miss Rotha Quillinan 's Album ; and another version numbering only eight lines was inscribed in an album in 1828 when Coleridge was on his Rhine tour with Wordsworth . After line 42 this version continues :—</head>
     <l n="1">As we creep feebly down life 's slope ,</l>
     <l n="2">Yet courteous dame , accept this truth ,</l>
     <l n="3">Hope leaves us not , but we leave hope ,</l>
     <l n="4">And quench the inward light of youth .</l>
     <l n="5">T. Colley Grattan 's Beaten Paths ,</l>
     <l n="6">1862 , ii . 139 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>There can be little doubt that lines 1-43 were composed in 1823 , and that the last six lines of the text which form part of An Old Man 's Sigh were composed , as an afterthought , in 1832 .</p>

    <head>[ 448 : 1 ] First published in the Evening Standard , May 21 , 1827 . ‘ The poem signed ΕΣΤΗΣΕ appeared likewise in the St. James 's Chronicle . ’ See Letter of S. T. C. to J. Blanco White , dated Nov. 28 , 1827 . Life , 1845 , i . 439 , 440 . First collected in 1834 . I have amended the text of 1834 in lines 7 , 17 , 34 , 39 in accordance with a MS. in the possession of the poet 's granddaughter , Miss Edith Coleridge . The poem as published in 1834 and every subsequent edition ( except 1907 ) is meaningless . Southey 's Book of the Church , 1825 , was answered by Charles Butler 's Book of the Roman Catholic Church , 1825 , and in an anonymous pamphlet by the Vicar Apostolic , Dr. John Milner , entitled Merlin 's Strictures . Southey retaliated in his Vindiciae Ecclesiae Anglicanae , 1826 . In the latter work he addresses Butler as ‘ an honourable and courteous opponent ’ — and contrasts his ‘ habitual urbanity ’ with the malignant and scurrilous attacks of that ‘ ill-mannered man ’ , Dr. Milner . In the ‘ Dialogue ’ the poet reminds his ‘ Friend ’ Southey that Rome is Rome , a ‘ brazen serpent ’ , charm she never so wisely . In the Vindiciae Southey devotes pp . 470-506 to an excursus on ‘ The Rosary ’ — the invention of St. Dominic . Hence the title — ‘ Sancti Dominici Pallium ’ .</head>

    <head>A CHARACTER [ 451 : 1 ]</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A bird , who for his other sins</l>
     <l n="2">Had liv 'd amongst the Jacobins ;</l>
     <l n="3">Though like a kitten amid rats ,</l>
     <l n="4">Or callow tit in nest of bats ,</l>
     <l n="5">He much abhorr 'd all democrats ; 5</l>
     <l n="6">Yet nathless stood in ill report</l>
     <l n="7">Of wishing ill to Church and Court ,</l>
     <l n="8">Tho ’ he 'd nor claw , nor tooth , nor sting ,</l>
     <l n="9">And learnt to pipe God save the King ;</l>
     <l n="10">Tho ’ each day did new feathers bring , 10</l>
     <l n="11">All swore he had a leathern wing ;</l>
     <l n="12">Nor polish 'd wing , nor feather 'd tail ,</l>
     <l n="13">Nor down-clad thigh would aught avail ;</l>
     <l n="14">And tho ’ — his tongue devoid of gall —</l>
     <l n="15">He civilly assur 'd them all :— 15</l>
     <l n="16">‘ A bird am I of Phoebus ’ breed ,</l>
     <l n="17">And on the sunflower cling and feed ;</l>
     <l n="18">My name , good Sirs , is Thomas Tit ! ’</l>
     <l n="19">The bats would hail him Brother Cit ,</l>
     <l n="20">Or , at the furthest , cousin-german . 20</l>
     <l n="21">At length the matter to determine ,</l>
     <l n="22">He publicly denounced the vermin ;</l>
     <l n="23">He spared the mouse , he praised the owl ;</l>
     <l n="24">But bats were neither flesh nor fowl .</l>
     <l n="25">Blood-sucker , vampire , harpy , goul , 25</l>
     <l n="26">Came in full clatter from his throat ,</l>
     <l n="27">Till his old nest-mates chang 'd their note</l>
     <l n="28">To hireling , traitor , and turncoat ,—</l>
     <l n="29">A base apostate who had sold</l>
     <l n="30">His very teeth and claws for gold ;— 30</l>
     <l n="31">And then his feathers !— sharp the jest —</l>
     <l n="32">No doubt he feather 'd well his nest !</l>
     <l n="33">‘ A Tit indeed ! aye , tit for tat —</l>
     <l n="34">With place and title , brother Bat ,</l>
     <l n="35">We soon shall see how well he 'll play 35</l>
     <l n="36">Count Goldfinch , or Sir Joseph Jay ! ’</l>
     <l n="37">Alas , poor Bird ! and ill-bestarr 'd —</l>
     <l n="38">Or rather let us say , poor Bard !</l>
     <l n="39">And henceforth quit the allegoric ,</l>
     <l n="40">With metaphor and simile , 40</l>
     <l n="41">For simple facts and style historic :—</l>
     <l n="42">Alas , poor Bard ! no gold had he ;</l>
     <l n="43">Behind another 's team he stept ,</l>
     <l n="44">And plough 'd and sow 'd , while others reapt ;</l>
     <l n="45">The work was his , but theirs the glory , 45</l>
     <l n="46">Sic vos non vobis , his whole story .</l>
     <l n="47">Besides , whate'er he wrote or said</l>
     <l n="48">Came from his heart as well as head ;</l>
     <l n="49">And though he never left in lurch</l>
     <l n="50">His king , his country , or his church , 50</l>
     <l n="51">‘ Twas but to humour his own cynical</l>
     <l n="52">Contempt of doctrines Jacobinical ;</l>
     <l n="53">To his own conscience only hearty ,</l>
     <l n="54">‘ Twas but by chance he serv 'd the party ;—</l>
     <l n="55">The self-same things had said and writ , 55</l>
     <l n="56">Had Pitt been Fox , and Fox been Pitt ;</l>
     <l n="57">Content his own applause to win ,</l>
     <l n="58">Would never dash thro ’ thick and thin ,</l>
     <l n="59">And he can make , so say the wise ,</l>
     <l n="60">No claim who makes no sacrifice ;— 60</l>
     <l n="61">And bard still less :— what claim had he ,</l>
     <l n="62">Who swore it vex 'd his soul to see</l>
     <l n="63">So grand a cause , so proud a realm ,</l>
     <l n="64">With Goose and Goody at the helm ;</l>
     <l n="65">Who long ago had fall'n asunder 65</l>
     <l n="66">But for their rivals ’ baser blunder ,</l>
     <l n="67">The coward whine and Frenchified</l>
     <l n="68">Slaver and slang of the other side ?—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="69">Thus , his own whim his only bribe ,</l>
     <l n="70">Our Bard pursued his old A . B. C. 70</l>
     <l n="71">Contented if he could subscribe</l>
     <l n="72">In fullest sense his name Ἔστησε ;</l>
     <l n="73">( ‘ Tis Punic Greek for ‘ he hath stood ! ’ )</l>
     <l n="74">Whate'er the men , the cause was good ;</l>
     <l n="75">And therefore with a right good will , 75</l>
     <l n="76">Poor fool , he fights their battles still .</l>
     <l n="77">Tush ! squeak 'd the Bats ;— a mere bravado</l>
     <l n="78">To whitewash that base renegado ;</l>
     <l n="79">‘ Tis plain unless you 're blind or mad ,</l>
     <l n="80">His conscience for the bays he barters ;— 80</l>
     <l n="81">And true it is — as true as sad —</l>
     <l n="82">These circlets of green baize he had —</l>
     <l n="83">But then , alas ! they were his garters !</l>
     <l n="84">Ah ! silly Bard , unfed , untended ,</l>
     <l n="85">His lamp but glimmer 'd in its socket ; 85</l>
     <l n="86">He lived unhonour 'd and unfriended</l>
     <l n="87">With scarce a penny in his pocket ;—</l>
     <l n="88">Nay — tho ’ he hid it from the many —</l>
     <l n="89">With scarce a pocket for his penny !</l>

   <p>FOOTNOTES :</p>
   <p>[ 455 : 1 ] There is no evidence as to date of composition . J. D. Campbell ( 1893 , p. 635 ) believed that it ‘ was written at Malta ’ . Line 18 seems to imply that the poem was not written in England . On the other hand a comparison of ll . 9 , 10 with a passage in the Allegoric Vision , which was re-written with large additions , and first published in 1817 , suggests a much later date . The editors of 1852 include these lines among ‘ Poems written in Later Life ’ , but the date (? 1826 ) now assigned is purely conjectural . First published in 1828 : included in 1829 and 1834 .</p>
   <p>[ 456 : 1 ] With lines 9 , 10 J. D. Campbell compares , ‘ After a pause of silence : even thus , said he , like two strangers that have fled to the same shelter from the same storm , not seldom do Despair and Hope meet for the first time in the porch of Death . ’ Allegoric Vision ( 1798-1817 ) ; vide Appendices of this edition .</p>
   <p>[ 456 : 2 ] This phenomenon , which the Author has himself experienced , and of which the reader may find a description in one of the earlier volumes of the Manchester Philosophical Transactions , is applied figuratively to the following passage in the Aids to Reflection :—</p>
   <p>‘ Pindar 's fine remark respecting the different effects of Music , on different characters , holds equally true of Genius — as many as are not delighted by it are disturbed , perplexed , irritated . The beholder either recognises it as a projected form of his own Being , that moves before him with a Glory round its head , or recoils from it as a Spectre . ’ — Aids to Reflection<span type="note_anchor">[ 1825 ]</span>, p. 220 .</p>

   <p>[ 457 : 1 ] First published in 1834 . With lines 36-43 , and with the poem as a whole , compare the following fragments of uncertain date , which were first published in a note to the edition of 1893 . Both the poem as completed and these fragments of earlier drafts seem to belong to the last decade of the poet 's life . The water-mark of the scrap of paper on which these drafts are written is 1819 , but the tone and workmanship of the verse suggest a much later date , possibly 1826 .</p>

   <p>[ 459 : 1 ] First published in 1828 : included in 1829 and 1834 . The MS. of the first draft , dated Sept. 2 , 1826 , is preceded by the following introductory note :—</p>
   <p>‘ QUESTION , ANSWER , AND SOLILOQUY .</p>
   <p>And are you ( said Alia to Constantius , on whose head sickness and sorrow had antedated Winter , ere yet the time of Vintage had passed ) , Are you the happier for your Philosophy ? And the smile of Constantius was as the light from a purple cluster of the vine , gleaming through snowflakes , as he replied , The Boons of Philosophy are of higher worth , than what you , O Alia , mean by Happiness . But I will not seem to evade the question — Am I the happier for my Philosophy ? The calmer at least and the less unhappy , answered Constantius , for it has enabled me to find that selfless Reason is the best Comforter , and only sure friend of declining Life . At this moment the sounds of a carriage followed by the usual bravura executed on the brazen knocker announced a morning visit : and Alia hastened to receive the party . Meantime the grey-haired philosopher , left to his own musings , continued playing with the thoughts that Alia and Alia 's question had excited , till he murmured them to himself in half audible words , which at first casually , and then for the amusement of his ear , he punctuated with rhymes , without however conceiting that he had by these means changed them into poetry . ’</p>

   <p>The emendation ἐπιθανοῦς ( i. e. moribund ) was suggested by the Reader of Macmillan 's edition of 1893 . Other alternatives , e. g. ἐπιδευοῦς ( the lacking ) , to the word as misprinted in the Literary Souvenir have been suggested , but there can be no doubt that what Coleridge intended to imply was that he was near his end .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Eliza . Ask our friend , the Improvisatore ; here he comes . Kate has a favour to ask of you , Sir ; it is that you will repeat the ballad [ 463 : 1 ] that Mr. —— sang so sweetly .</p>
   <p>Friend . It is in Moore 's Irish Melodies ; but I do not recollect the words distinctly . The moral of them , however , I take to be this :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Love would remain the same if true ,</l>
     <l n="2">When we were neither young nor new ;</l>
     <l n="3">Yea , and in all within the will that came ,</l>
     <l n="4">By the same proofs would show itself the same .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Eliz . What are the lines you repeated from Beaumont and Fletcher , which my mother admired so much ? It begins with something about two vines so close that their tendrils intermingle .</p>

     <l n="9">Kath . A precious boon , that would go far to reconcile one to old</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="14">Fri. From a man turned of fifty , Katharine , I imagine , expects a less</l>
     <l n="15">confident answer .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="16">Kath . A more sincere one , perhaps .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="17">Fri . Even though he should have obtained the nick-name of</l>
     <l n="18">Improvisatore , by perpetrating charades and extempore verses at</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="20">Eliz . Nay , but be serious .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Fri. Serious ! Doubtless . A grave personage of my years giving a Love-lecture to two young ladies , cannot well be otherwise . The difficulty , I suspect , would be for them to remain so . It will be asked whether I am not the ‘ elderly gentleman ’ who sate ‘ despairing beside a clear stream ’ , with a willow for his wig-block .</p>
   <p>Eliz . Say another word , and we will call it downright affectation .</p>
   <p>Kath . No ! we will be affronted , drop a courtesy , and ask pardon for our presumption in expecting that Mr. —— would waste his sense on two insignificant girls .</p>
   <p>Fri. Well , well , I will be serious . Hem ! Now then commences the discourse ; Mr. Moore 's song being the text . Love , as distinguished from Friendship , on the one hand , and from the passion that too often usurps its name , on the other —</p>
   <p>Lucius ( Eliza 's brother , who had just joined the trio , in a whisper to the Friend ) . But is not Love the union of both ?</p>
   <p>Fri. ( aside to Lucius ) . He never loved who thinks so .</p>
   <p>Eliz . Brother , we do n't want you . There ! Mrs. H. cannot arrange the flower vase without you . Thank you , Mrs. Hartman .</p>
   <p>Luc . I 'll have my revenge ! I know what I will say !</p>
   <p>Eliz . Off ! Off ! Now , dear Sir ,— Love , you were saying —</p>
   <p>Fri. Hush ! Preaching , you mean , Eliza .</p>
   <p>Eliz . ( impatiently ) . Pshaw !</p>
   <p>Fri. Well then , I was saying that Love , truly such , is itself not the most common thing in the world : and mutual love still less so . But that enduring personal attachment , so beautifully delineated by Erin 's sweet melodist , and still more touchingly , perhaps , in the well-known ballad , ‘ John Anderson , my Jo , John , ’ in addition to a depth and constancy of character of no every-day occurrence , supposes a peculiar sensibility and tenderness of nature ; a constitutional communicativeness and utterancy of heart and soul ; a delight in the detail of sympathy , in the outward and visible signs of the sacrament within — to count , as it were , the pulses of the life of love . But above all , it supposes a soul which , even in the pride and summer-tide of life — even in the lustihood of health and strength , had felt oftenest and prized highest that which age cannot take away and which , in all our lovings , is the Love ;—</p>
   <p>Eliz . There is something here ( pointing to her heart ) that seems to understand you , but wants the word that would make it understand itself .</p>
   <p>Kath . I , too , seem to feel what you mean . Interpret the feeling for us .</p>
   <p>Fri. —— I mean that willing sense of the insufficingness of the self for itself , which predisposes a generous nature to see , in the total being of another , the supplement and completion of its own ;— that quiet perpetual seeking which the presence of the beloved object modulates , not suspends , where the heart momently finds , and , finding , again seeks on ;— lastly , when ‘ life 's changeful orb has pass 'd the full ’ , a confirmed faith in the nobleness of humanity , thus brought home and pressed , as it were , to the very bosom of hourly experience ; it supposes , I say , a heartfelt reverence for worth , not the less deep because divested of its solemnity by habit , by familiarity , by mutual infirmities , and even by a feeling of modesty which will arise in delicate minds , when they are conscious of possessing the same or the correspondent excellence in their own characters . In short , there must be a mind , which , while it feels the beautiful and the excellent in the beloved as its own , and by right of love appropriates it , can call Goodness its Playfellow ; and dares make sport of time and infirmity , while , in the person of a thousand-foldly endeared partner , we feel for aged Virtue the caressing fondness that belongs to the Innocence of childhood , and repeat the same attentions and tender courtesies which had been dictated by the same affection to the same object when attired in feminine loveliness or in manly beauty .</p>
   <p>Eliz . What a soothing — what an elevating idea !</p>
   <p>Kath . If it be not only an idea .</p>
   <p>Fri. At all events , these qualities which I have enumerated , are rarely found united in a single individual . How much more rare must it be , that two such individuals should meet together in this wide world under circumstances that admit of their union as Husband and Wife . A person may be highly estimable on the whole , nay , amiable as neighbour , friend , housemate — in short , in all the concentric circles of attachment save only the last and inmost ; and yet from how many causes be estranged from the highest perfection in this ! Pride , coldness , or fastidiousness of nature , worldly cares , an anxious or ambitious disposition , a passion for display , a sullen temper ,— one or the other — too often proves ‘ the dead fly in the compost of spices ’ , and any one is enough to unfit it for the precious balm of unction . For some mighty good sort of people , too , there is not seldom a sort of solemn saturnine , or , if you will , ursine vanity , that keeps itself alive by sucking the paws of its own self-importance . And as this high sense , or rather sensation of their own value is , for the most part , grounded on negative qualities , so they have no better means of preserving the same but by negatives — that is , by not doing or saying any thing , that might be put down for fond , silly , or nonsensical ;— or ( to use their own phrase ) by never forgetting themselves , which some of their acquaintance are uncharitable enough to think the most worthless object they could be employed in remembering .</p>
   <p>Eliz . ( in answer to a whisper from Katharine ) . To a hair ! He must have sate for it himself . Save me from such folks ! But they are out of the question .</p>
   <p>Fri . True ! but the same effect is produced in thousands by the too general insensibility to a very important truth ; this , namely , that the MISERY of human life is made up of large masses , each separated from the other by certain intervals . One year , the death of a child ; years after , a failure in trade ; after another longer or shorter interval , a daughter may have married unhappily ;— in all but the singularly unfortunate , the integral parts that compose the sum total of the unhappiness of a man 's life , are easily counted , and distinctly remembered . The HAPPINESS of life , on the contrary , is made up of minute fractions — the little , soon-forgotten charities of a kiss , a smile , a kind look , a heartfelt compliment in the disguise of playful raillery , and the countless other infinitesimals of pleasurable thought and genial feeling .</p>
   <p>Kath . Well , Sir ; you have said quite enough to make me despair of finding a ‘ John Anderson , my Jo , John ’ , with whom to totter down the hill of life .</p>
   <p>Fri. Not so ! Good men are not , I trust , so much scarcer than good women , but that what another would find in you , you may hope to find in another . But well , however , may that boon be rare , the possession of which would be more than an adequate reward for the rarest virtue .</p>
   <p>Eliz . Surely , he , who has described it so well , must have possessed it ?</p>
   <p>Fri . If he were worthy to have possessed it , and had believingly anticipated and not found it , how bitter the disappointment !</p>
   <p>( Then , after a pause of a few minutes ) .</p>
   <p>ANSWER , ex improviso</p>

     <l n="1">Yes , yes ! that boon , life 's richest treat</l>
     <l n="2">He had , or fancied that he had ;</l>
     <l n="3">Say , ‘ twas but in his own conceit —</l>

     <l n="7">The fair fulfilment of his poesy ,</l>
     <l n="8">When his young heart first yearn 'd for sympathy !</l>
     <l n="9">But e'en the meteor offspring of the brain</l>
     <l n="10">Unnourished wane ; 10</l>
     <l n="11">Faith asks her daily bread ,</l>
     <l n="12">And Fancy must be fed !</l>
     <l n="13">Now so it chanced — from wet or dry ,</l>
     <l n="14">It boots not how — I know not why —</l>
     <l n="15">She missed her wonted food ; and quickly 15</l>
     <l n="16">Poor Fancy stagger 'd and grew sickly .</l>
     <l n="17">Then came a restless state , ‘ twixt yea and nay ,</l>
     <l n="18">His faith was fix 'd , his heart all ebb and flow ;</l>

     <l n="21">That boon , which but to have possess 'd</l>

   <p>FOOTNOTES :</p>
   <p>[ 469 : 1 ] First published in 1834 . The date of composition cannot be ascertained . The MS ., an early if not a first draft , is certainly of late date . The water-marks of the paper ( Bath Post ) are 1822 and 1828 . There is a second draft ( MS. b ) of lines 97-112 . Line 37 , ‘ Dan Ovid 's mazy tale of loves , ’ may be compared with line 100 of The Garden of Boccaccio , ‘ Peers Ovid 's Holy Book of Love 's sweet smart , ’ and it is probable that Alice Du Clos was written about the same time , 1828-9 . In line 91 ‘ Ellen ’ is no doubt a slip of the pen for ‘ Alice ’ .</p>

Più nel uno is Francesco de Sallez ’ brief and happy definition of the beautiful , and the shorter the poem the more indispensable is it that the Più should not overlay the Uno , that the unity should be evident . But to sacrifice the gratification , the sting of pleasure , from a fine passage to the satisfaction , the sense of complacency arising from the contemplation of a symmetrical Whole is among the last conquests achieved by men of genial powers . ’</p>

   <p>From the letter to Mrs. Aders it appears that Coleridge did not contemplate the epitaph being inscribed on his tombstone , but that he intended it to be printed ‘ in letters of a distinctly visible and legible size ’ on the outline of a tomb-stone to be engraved as a vignette to be published in a magazine , or to illustrate the last page of his ‘ Miscellaneous Poems ’ in the second volume of his Poetical Works . It would seem that the artist , Miss Denman , had included in her sketch of the vignette the figure of a Muse , and to this Coleridge objects :— ‘ A rude old yew-tree , or a mountain ash , with a grave or two , or any other characteristic of a village church-yard ,— such a hint of a landscape was all I meant ; but if any figure rather that of an elderly man , thoughtful with quiet tears upon his cheek . ’ Letters of S. T. C ., 1895 , ii . 770 .</p>
