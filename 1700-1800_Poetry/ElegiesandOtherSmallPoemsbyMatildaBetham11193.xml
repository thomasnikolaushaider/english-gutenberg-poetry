    <docTitle><titlePart>ELEGIES AND OTHER SMALL POEMS BY MATILDA BETHAM . To the Hon . LADY JERNINGHAM . Madam , The many endearing instances of regard I have experienced since I had the honor of being known to your Ladyship , while they impress my mind with gratitude , flatter my hopes with a favourable reception of the following miscellanies , which , under your patronage , I venture to submit to the public . Considered as the first essays of an early period of life , and as the exercises of leisure , my wishes suggest , that they may not , perhaps , be found wholly unworthy of attention ; but whatever be their fate with others , I shall feel myself much gratified , if , in your Ladyship 's judgment , they may be allowed some merit . Though there cannot be a greater pleasure than dwelling on the excellencies of a distinguished and amiable character , I know not that it would be permitted me to indulge my present inclination with enumerating those virtues and endowments which confessedly distinguish your Ladyship , but my wishes I may offer , and that you may long , very long , continue to bless your family , to adorn your rank , and console the unhappy , is the sincere prayer of Your Ladyship 's most obliged humble servant , MATILDA BETHAM .</titlePart></docTitle>

    <head>TO THE READER .</head>
    <p n="1">If , in the following pages , there may be found any unacknowledged imitations , I hope I shall not be censured as an intentional plagiarist ; for it has been my wish , however I may be esteemed presumptuous , not to be unjust ; and I sometimes fear lest an imperfect recollection of another 's idea should have appeared to me as a dawning thought of my own . Wherever I could recollect a similar passage , although unnoticed at the time I wrote , it has been either altered or acknowledged .</p>

    <docImprint>I commit these trifles to the press with the anxiety necessarily resulting from a desire that they may not be deemed altogether worthless . Though the natural partiality of the writer may be somewhat strengthened by the commendations of friends and parents , I am well aware that no apology can give currency to imperfection . I have not vainly attempted to ascend to the steeps of Parnassus . If , wandering at its foot , I have mistaken perishable shrubs for never-dying flowers , the errors of a youthful mind , first viewing the fascinating regions of fancy , will not be rigidly condemned ; for wherever there is true taste , there will be genuine candour .</docImprint>

    <docDate><date>1794</date>. Ah ! if your eye should e'er these lines survey , Dismiss from thence its penetrating ray : Let Criticism then her distance keep , And dreaded Justice then be lull 'd to sleep ; For , let whatever sentence be their due , I feel I cannot censure bear from you . A British Maid awaits the arrival of her lover from the battle , on a hill , where , at its commencement , she had retired to make vows to heaven for his success .— Evening . ARTHUR and ALBINA . Ah me ! the yellow western sky turns pale , And leaves the cheerless sons of earth to mourn ; And yet I hear net in the silent vale , A sound to tell me Arthur does return . Ah , haste ye hours ! quick plume the loit'ring wing ! Bring back my hero , crown 'd with glorious spoils ! Let bards on lofty harps his triumphs sing , And loud applause repay successful toils ! Reward the flame , ye great celestial pow'rs , The noble flame that in his bosom glows ! Inspire him , Druids , from your holy bow'rs , With strength to conquer iron-breasted foes !<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>With heighten 'd vigour brace his nervous arm , And let his lance with ten-fold fury fly , Make him terrific by some potent charm , And add new lightening to his piercing eye ! Then may my lover gain unrivall 'd fame , The Roman banners may less proudly flow , Then he may humble their detested name , And their high plumes wave o'er ’ a British brow ! Then may his chariot ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>wheeling o'er the plain , Hurl death and desolation all around , While his intrepid front appals their train , And make our proud invaders bite the ground ! But yet I hear no lively foot advance ; No sound of triumph greets my list'ning ear ! ’ And I may carve this eagle-darting lance For one , whose voice I never more shall hear ! Perhaps my vows have never reach 'd the skies , Nor heav'n , propitious , smil 'd upon my pray'r ; And ah ! to morrow 's crimson dawn may rise To plunge me in the horrors of despair ! Yet well he knows the dreadful spear to wield — Alas ! their fearful limbs are fenc 'd with care : And , what can valour , when th'extended shield<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>May leave , so oft , his gen'rous bosom bare ? Say , reverend Druids , can you bless in vain ? Can you in vain extend your spotless hands ? Will not heav'n listen when its priests complain , And save its altars from unhallow 'd bands ? Oh yes ! I 'll fear no more ! The sacred groves ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>That rear their untouch 'd branches to the skies ; Beneath whose shade its chosen servant roves , Hidden from weak , unconsecrated eyes : Beneath whose shade the choral bards rehearse , Piercing , with uprais 'd eyes , each mist that shrouds , And , listening , catch the heav'nhYpppHeNdictated verse , By airs etherial wailed from the clouds : It ne'er can be — but hark ! I hear the sound Of some one 's step ; yet not the youth I love ; He would have flown , and scarcely touch 'd the ground , Not ling'ring thus , with weary caution , move . The heavy wanderer approaches nigh , But the drear darkness skreens him from my views Ah , gracious heav'n ! it was my Arthur 's sigh , Which the unwilling breeze so faintly blew . Oh speak ! inform me what I have to fear ! Speak , and relieve my doubting , trembling heart ! To thy Albina , with a tongue sincere , A portion of thy wretchedness impart ! ” “ Sweet maid , ” replied the wounded , dying youth , In accents mournful , tremulous and slow , “ Yes , I will ever answer thee with truth , While yet the feeble tide of life shall flow . We made the haughty Roman chiefs retire , The tow'ring , sacrilegious eagle<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>flew ; Our bosoms swell 'd with more than mortal fire , When from the field indignant they withdrew . But ill bespeaks my faint and languid tongue , The glowing beauties of that joyful sight ; Ill can my breast , with keenest torture wrung , Dwell on the charming terrors of the fight . To others then I leave the envied strain , Which shall for ages rend the British air ; Nor will thy partial ear expect , in vain , To find the humble name of Arthur there . I go , while now the victory is warm , The just reward of valour to obtain ; Soon I return , clad in a nobler form ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>Again to triumph , and again be slain . Ah ! then , my dear Albina , cease to grieve , Nor at thy lover 's glorious fate repine ; For , though my present favour 'd form I leave , This constant heart shall still be only thine .</docDate>
    <docImprint>Alas ! e'en now I feel the icy hand Of hasty death , press down my swelling heart ; E'en now I hear a sweet aerial band , Summon thy faithful Arthur to depart . Let not thy tears an absent lover mourn , Remember that he bravely , nobly died ; Remember that he quickly will return , And claim again his lov 'd , his destin 'd bride . ” As thus the warrior 's fainting spirits fled , And parting life streamed forth at every vein , His quivering lip , in whispers , softly said , “ Remember , Arthur dies to live again ! ” “ Oh stay , dear youth ! ” the hapless maiden cries , My best-lov 'd Arthur , but one moment stay ! And close not yet those all-enlivening eyes , So lately lighted at the torch of day . Ah ! yet once more , that look of tender love , Of fond regret , my Arthur , let me view ! Let one more effort thy affection , prove , And bid me once , once more , a long adieu . Now , ere the moon withdraws her feeble light , Ope yet again on me thy fading eye ! He hears not ! memory has ta'en her flight , And vanish 'd with that last convulsive sigh . Why did I variegated wreaths prepare , To pay the conqueror every honor due ? Or , why , with fillets , bind my flowing hair , And tinge my arms of the bright azure hue ?<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>Oh ! must this constant bosom beat no more ? This skilful hand no more direct the spear ? Must lost Albina still her fate deplore , And ever drop the unavailing tear ? Must I no more that lovely face review , Expressing each emotion of the mind ? No more repeat a sweetly sad adieu ? No more gay chaplets on his forehead bind ? His forehead , high and fair , with martial grace , And bold , free curls of glossy chesnut crown 'd ; The full , dark eye-brow which adorn 'd his face , O'erwhelming foes with terror as he frown 'd . His voice , though strong , harmoniously clear , No more shall fill Albina with delight ; No more shall sooth her still-attentive ear , And make her fancy every sorrow light . Farewell to love , to happiness , and joy ! Yet will I cull the summer 's choicest bloom ; Funereal chaplets shall my time employ , And wither daily on my Arthur 's tomb . ” As thus she mourn 'd , with bitterest woe opprest , A ray of light illumin 'd all the grove , And a consoling voice the fair addrest , In the soft accents of parental love . Though still she clasp 'd her hero 's valued corse , She slowly rais 'd her languid , streaming eyes , And own 'd astonishment 's resistless force , Viewing the stranger with a wild surprize . The form was clad in robes of purest white , That swept with solemn dignity the ground ; Contrasting with the blackest gloom of night , Which reign 'd in awful majesty around . The silver beard did reverence demand ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>And told her that a holy bard was there , Whose shrivell 'd fingers grasp 'd a flaming brand , Which threw a lustre on the waving hair . His eye possess 'd the brilliant fire of youth , United with the wisdom of the sage ; And speaking , with the simple voice of truth , He blended the solemnity of age . “ Arise ! thou loveliest of misfortune 's train , And cease these weak , desponding tears to shed ; The soft effusions of thy grief restrain , Which serve but to disturb the peaceful dead . The youth you mourn , far from these scenes of woe , To worlds of never-ending joy is flown ; Where his blest bosom with delight shall glow , And his fair temples wear a princely crown . Ah then , presumptuous ! question not the skies , Nor more with vain laments his loss deplore ; Attend to this , and cease your fruitless sighs , You soon shall meet where you can part no more . "[ 9 ] Awe-struck , his sacred wisdom she confest , Which pour 'd sweet consolation on her mind ; She cross 'd her blood-stain 'd hands upon her breast , And bow 'd her humble , grateful head , resign 'd .

THE FRATERNAL DUEL . ‘ Oh ! hide me from the sun ! I loath the sight ! I cannot bear his bright , obtrusive ray : Nought is so dreadful to my gloom as light ! Nothing so dismal as the blaze of day ! No more may I its sparkling glories view ! No more its piercing lustre meet my eye ! On night 's black wings my only comfort flew ; At breath of morn I sicken and I die . Where can I fly ? In what sequester 'd clime Does darkness ever hold her ebon reign ? Where woeful dirges measure out the time , And endless echoes breathe the sullen strain . Where dreary mountains rear their low'ring heads , To pierce the heavy and umbrageous clouds ; And where the cavern dewy moisture sheds , And night 's thick veil the guilty mourner shrouds . There , lost in horrors , I might vent my sighs ; To open misery myself resign ; Might snatch each torturing vision ere it flies , And feast on prospects desolate as mine . Oh ! let me thither quickly take my flight , And chuse a favourite and a final seat , In scenes which would each gentler mind affright , But for my guilt affords a fit retreat . There , where no ray , no gleam of light could come , There , and there only , could I find relief ; There might I ruminate on Edward 's doom , And lose myself in luxury of grief . And , as it is , though joys around me shine , Though pleasure here erects her dazzling brow , Wrapt in despondence , will I droop and pine , And tears of anguish shall for ever flow . Oh Edward ! could'st thou see this alter 'd frame , Which youthful graces lately did adorn ! Could'st thou behold , and think me still the same , Thy once gay friend , thus hapless and forlorn ? The cheek , so late by ruddy health embrown 'd , Now pale and faded with incessant tears ; The eye , which once elate , disdain 'd the ground , Now sunk and languid in its orb appears . Oh ! never , never will I cease to grieve ! And sure repentance pardon may obtain ! Can woe unfeign 'd incite heav'n to relieve A wretch opprest with agonizing pain ? Ah no ! my hands are stain 'd with brother 's blood ! A father 's curses load my sinking head ! I wish to die , but dare not pass the flood , For there , as well as here , my hopes are fled . Sleep , which was meant to chase away the thought , To lull the sound of dissonant despair , Appears to me with added terrors fraught , And my torn heart can find no refuge there . If , for a moment , I its fetters wear , And its soft pressure these pale eyes controul , I injur 'd Emma 's just reproaches hear , Or Edward 's form appals my shrinking soul . When in those transitory sleeps I lie , I oft his beauteous , bleeding form review ; A mild , benignant lustre lights his eye , As come to bid a friend a last adieu . I start , I shudder at his tuneful voice , When it , in soothing whispers , meets my ear ; That sound , which oft has made my heart rejoice , I now all-trembling and affrighted hear . Was it thy fault , dear , much-lamented youth If lovely Emma did thy suit prefer ? She saw thee form 'd of tenderness and truth , And kings might glory to be lov 'd by her . Thy native sweetness won her artless heart ; And well our different characters she knew ; Whilst thy mild looks did happiness impart , She saw the murderer in each glance I threw . Yet for this , meanly , did I thee upbraid , And basely urg 'd an elder brother 's right ; Then , calling impious passion to my aid , Forc 'd thee , unwilling , to the fatal fight . Oh ! ne'er shall I forget the dreadful hour , I sheath 'd my weapon in thy noble breast ; Thy dying hand clasp 'd mine , with feeble pow'r , And to thy mangled bosom fondly prest . Whilst o'er thee , I , in speechless anguish hung , Thou saw'st the wild distraction of my eye ; And , though the chills of death restrain 'd thy tongue Thy bosom heav 'd a sympathetic sigh . With cruel tenderness my friends contriv 'd , To bear me from the drear , polluted shore ; Of every joy , of peace itself depriv 'd , Which this despairing breast shall know no more . Since this what frenzy has inspir 'd my mind ! My tortur 'd mem'ry cannot it retrace ; No relique now of former days I find , But horrors , which e'en madness can n't efface . My dearest brother , and my tenderest friend , O come , and save me from this dark abyss ! Draw hence the darts which my rack 'd bosom rend ! And bear me with you to the realms of bliss ! Ah ! whence that pang which smote my shuddering heart ? Where now , for refuge , can lost Anselm fly ? ‘ Tis Death ! I know him by his crimson dart ! And , am I fit ? Oh heav'ns ! I cannot die ! My spirit is not form 'd for rapid flight ; It cannot cut the vast expanse of air , No , never can it reach the realms of light , For sin , a weight immoveable , lies there ! ’ Thus wretched Anselm rav 'd : unhappy youth ! Though passion hurried thee so far astray , Thy infant soul ador 'd the God of Truth , And virtue usher 'd in thy vernal day . Oh ! had he learn 'd his passions to restrain , And let cool reason in his breast preside , His op'ning wisdom had not bloom 'd in vain , Nor had he , ere the prime of manhood , died . Yet , if remorse could expiate his guilt , If the worst sufferings could the crime erase , If tears could wash away the blood he spilt , Then Anselm 's penitence obtain 'd him grace . AUGUST 20 ,<date>1794</date>. IN A LETTER to A. R. C . ON HER WISHING TO BE CALLED ANNA . Forgive me , if I wound your ear , By calling of you Nancy , Which is the name of my sweet friend , The other 's but her fancy . Ah , dearest girl ! how could your mind The strange distinction frame ? The whimsical , unjust caprice , Which robs you of your name . Nancy agrees with what we see , A being wild and airy ; Gay as a nymph of Flora 's train , Fantastic as a fairy . But Anna 's of a different kind , A melancholy maid ; Boasting a sentimental soul , In solemn pomp array 'd . Oh ne'er will I forsake the sound , So artless and so free ! Be what you will with all mankind . But Nancy still with me . THE LONELY WALK , To W. S. B . When the grey evening spreads a calm around , Tell me , has thy bewilder 'd fancy sought , Retir 'd in some sequestered spot of ground , Rest , from the labour of eternal thought ? When , wrapt in self , the soul enjoys repose , The wearied brain resigns its fervent heat , In dream-like musing every care we lose , And wind our way with slowly-moving feet . Oft , to indulge the thought-exploded sig , When , slowly wandering at the close of day , Light emanations from th'abstracted eye , With transient beauty in the sun-beams play , Thy sister seeks the solitary shade . Her mind inhaling the aerial gloom , Sees , not-observing , the fair landscape fade , And sullen mist usurping day-light 's room . Not her 's the feelings which regret inspires , When sorrows keen have made the spirits low ; Adversity has damp 'd the youthful fires , And all the tears that fall are tears of woe . Ah no ! possessing every social bliss , I cannot , will not at my fate repine ; Or ask for happiness excelling this , When such a world of treasures now are mine ! And , when the melancholy grove I seek , Scarce can my palpitating heart controul , While silent tears are trembling on my cheek , The flood of pleasure swelling in my soul . But soon my too-elated thoughts are calm , The tumults of the mental chaos cease ; A soft oblivion the rais 'd senses charm , And lull to a reflecting , soothing peace . Hail , sweet enhancements of the languid mind ! Whose calm reposes restless worldlings scorn ; But from whose aid recruited strength we find , And waken , lively as the bird of morn . And thou , lov 'd boy , in whose congenial breast , I doubt not but those sentiments reside ; For we , our thoughts , our actions have confest , As much in hearts as persons are allied ; Hail thou , my brother ! may thy steps be led By heav'nly wisdom through this world of care , And gain the realms for which our Saviour , bled ! Nor pain , nor lassitude await us there . OCTOBER 13 ,<date>1794</date>. The first Percy , who came over with William the Conqueror , married a Saxon lady , called Emma de Port , said to have been the daughter of the last Saxon Earl of Northumberland , whose possessions had been given to him ( Lord William de Percy ) for his services . I have taken the liberty of supposing this lady to have had a brother . THE OUTLAW . Before the fair Aurora spread Her azure mantle o'er the skies , While sleep its pleasing influence shed , On grateful mortals weary eyes , Emerg 'd from a surrounding wood , On a bleak mountain 's sullen brow , A solitary outlaw stood , And view 'd , through mist , the world below . With deep regret his bosom fraught , His arms were wreath 'd in sorrow 's knot<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>; Nor seem 'd he yet , by patience taught , To bear submissively his lot . Hidden was each enlivening grace ; Deprest by his untimely doom ; A hectic flush o'erspread his face , Instead of nature 's florid bloom . Untutor 'd in the school of grief , His pining spirit spoke in sighs ; Though almost hopeless of relief , He look 'd around with eager eyes ; And fondly bent an anxious ear , To the slow murmuring of the breeze , Essaying oft , in vain , to hear A friendly step beneath the trees . “ Delusive wish ! ” at last he cried , “ Why wilt thou fill my aching breast ? And thus my miseries deride , By telling how I might be blest . “ No kind consolers hither bend , By sympathy to ease my care ; Here comes no ever-faithful friend , Who yet might shield me from despair . “ The abbey 's well-known tow'r I seek , It fades from my impassion 'd eye ; The fancied outlines softly break , And melt into the distant sky . “ No pitying object now remains , That I may know those scenes are near , Where generous love and friendship reigns , And Alwin 's name may claim a tear . “ And you , my lov 'd paternal groves , Where I no more must shew my head ; In your fair walks a stranger roves , And treacherous Normans daily tread ! “ E'en now their presence may prophane The halls where Herbert did reside ! E'en now may joy and gladness reign , And Adelaide be Percy 's bride . “ Yet no ! her soul , the seat of truth , Would ne'er a second love receive ! The sacred vows of artless youth , Her Alwin ever shall believe ! “ They still shall comfort my sad heart , And sooth the anguish of my mind ; Shall still a cheering hope impart , And make me somewhat more resign 'd . “ Ah ! yet I hear her trembling hand , Withdraw the bolt to set me free ! Yet hear the hasty , kind command , My Alwin fly , and live for me ! “ No other can obtain my love ! I would for thee the world resign ! Then let thy prompt obedience prove That thou art truly , wholly mine . ” “ And ever to her promise true , No pleasure shall her soul elate , For , yet her constant thoughts pursue A wretched Outlaw 's hapless fate ! “ In vain proud Ranulph<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>shall upbraid , My Adelaide is still the same ! And , for thy sake , dear , lovely maid , I will not curse the Norman name ! “ Not , though my father 's large domains , Are plunder 'd by the murderous bands ; And my Northumbria 's fertile plains , Lie wasted by their cruel hands ; “ Though , as a son , I mourn the fate Of those , to whom my life I owe ; And hate the hearts that thus create The dimness of severest woe ; “ Though I behold no friendly steel , To give my Emma vengeance , drawn ; And though a brother 's pangs I feel , To know her destitute , forlorn ; “ Though , banish 'd from the sight of day , In dreary solitude I pine ; And , forc 'd to feel a tyrant 's sway , Each dear paternal right resign ; “ Yet will I seal my lips ; nor dare To extricate my haughty foes : The hateful , guilty root I spare , Which can produce so fair a rose . “ But thou , my heart , wilt thou be calm ? Oh ! tell me , can reflection cease ; And this fond bosom , now so warm , Be ever tranquilliz 'd to peace ! “ Ah , no ! a father 's scornful eye Is ever present to my view ; And tells me , Herbert dar 'd to die , Though Normans could his son subdue . “ Each feeble plea his soul disdains , They cannot for the fault atone ; Though , when I left Northumbria 's plains , I had not fifteen summers known . “ And hear me , Herbert , when I swear It was not fear that urg 'd my flight ; A worthless life was not my care , I thought but of a parent 's right . “ Then pardon that my youth comply 'd , To ease a mother 's anxious fears That , when I rather would have died , I yielded to a sister 's tears . “ Alas ! a peasant 's humble shed , Soon saw our sainted parents ’ death , Who , while our hearts in anguish bled , With pious hopes resign 'd her breath . “ When mists foretel the ev'ning near , And clouds of chilling dew arise , We sought the grave of her so dear , And offer 'd there our tears and sighs . “ ‘ Till mild reflection lent her aid , And bade our filial sorrows cease ; The fever of our souls allay 'd , We sunk into a mournful peace . “ My pensive bosom strove to keep A dying mother 's last request ; I let the thoughts of vengeance sleep , And studied to make Emma blest . “ No longer shunning of the dawn , Or seeking the sequester 'd shade , I call 'd my sister to the lawn , And trod with her the flow'ry glade . “ Submitting to our wayward fate , I talk 'd not of the treasures flown ; But still seem 'd easy and sedate , While pressing verdure not my own . “ Then all I wish 'd , and all I fear 'd , Was by fraternal love inspir 'd ; And one , by every tie endear 'd , The only friend my soul desir 'd . “ Yet soon that pleasing calmness fled , A Norman beauty won my heart , Imperious love my footsteps led , And bade all secrecy depart . “ I own 'd the splendour of my race , Altho ’ a peasant 's form I bore ; I fancied silence was disgrace , And hid my sentiments no more . “ Her father 's tongue my fate decreed , And doom 'd great Herbert 's son to shame ; For , tho ’ by love from prison freed , I bear an outlaw 's hateful name . “ My sister no fond friend can shield , No relative allay her grief ; For tyranny all hearts hath steel 'd , And nought can give her soul relief . “ With ev'ry quality to charm , A guardian will not heaven allow , To screen thy artless youth from harm , And , fair deserted ! help thee now ! “ No aid , no comfort , can be nigh ! And shall thy brother here remain ? Has he not fortitude to fly , And burst the heavy , servile chain ? “ Why should I linger here alone , Unseen by every human eye ? To live unfriended and unknown , And in this dreary desart die . “ For now the sun-beams gild the sky , And give the misty morning grace , Far from the light I 'm doom 'd to fly , Abandon 'd by the human race . “ But no ! I 'll bear suspense no more ! Too dear a price to purchase breath ; I 'll seek the scenes I yet deplore , And meet a welcome , wish'dhYpppHeNfor , death . ” Tortur 'd to frenzy , Alwin flew , And as he left his sad retreat , He , turning , look 'd a last adieu , And shook the dew-drops from his feet . His hurried steps nor press 'd the ground , Nor pointed out the path he came ; And , though so long the way he found , Despair buoy 'd up his fainting frame . The sun shot forth a feeble ray , But hid his glorious orb from sight , And the pale evening 's modest grey , Had soften 'd the too-glaring light , When Alwin reach 'd the humble cot , That once he did with Emma share , And , weeping , hail 'd the well-known spot , In vain , for Emma was not there . Repuls 'd , he turn 'd his languid eye , Where Ranulph 's lofty turrets rose ; And , heaving disappointment 's sigh , He sought the mansion of his foes . His faltering step , when there he came , A proud , disdainful air possest ; Memory recall 'd his former shame , And indignation fill 'd his breast . He enter 'd , in his wild attire , With hasty pace and haggard brow , Scorn fill 'd his azure eye with fire , And gave his cheeks a deeper glow . A graceful knight who met his view , Sat pleading by a lady 's side ; And Alwin 's jealous bosom knew Lord Percy , and his fated bride . Mistaken youth ! thy eyes have seen , The persons pictur 'd in thy mind ; But who is that , with pensive mien , And forehead on her hand reclin 'd ? O'er whom Lord Ranulph fondly bends , With sorrow seated on his brow ; While the regretting tear descends O'er his pale cheek , in silent woe . “ Ah ! is it thus ? ” sad Alwin said , The fancied bride the accents knew , Lord Percy rais 'd his drooping head , And lovely Emma met his view . Then rapture and surprize prevail 'd , Each bosom felt confus 'd delight ; While his return the mourner hail 'd , And thus his sorrows did requite . “ O , dearest Alwin , now no more My father disapproves our flame ; No longer we thy loss deplore , Or tremble to pronounce thy name . “ A noble friend has gain 'd our cause , And vanquish 'd all his former hate ; Who , ere he own 'd a lover 's laws , With generous tears had wept thy fate . ” “ Yes , injur 'd youth , ” Lord Ranulph cried , “ Thou art this day my chosen heir ; In Adelaide behold thy bride , Thy sister 's future husband , there . “ Lord Percy , to a candid mind , Unites a fervour like thy own ; And Emma , not to merit blind , Refers his cause to thee alone . “ If thou wilt grant his fond desire , ‘ Twill gain a brave , a noble friend ; And the possessions of thy sire , To his posterity descend . ” “ And did my Emma stay to hear , Her brother sanctify her choice ? Ah Percy ! now you need not fear From Alwin , a dissenting voice . “ Blest in my love , in Emma blest , My heart each cherish 'd wish obtains ; Northumbrians , now no more opprest , Shall own a son of Herbert reigns . “ May ye rebuild the peasant 's cot , Exalt the woe-depressed head , And o'er each desolated spot , The fostering calm of quiet spread ! “ May sterne reserve and caution cease ! With lenient hand dispense your sway ; Give them the healing balm of peace , Their wounded spirits will obey . “ Ah ! cheer their gloom ! dispel their care ! The smile will soon replace the tear ; And , wedded to a Saxon fair , The foreign lord no more appear . ”</docImprint>

Where cooling zephyrs faintly blow , Nor spread the cheering , healthful glow . That glides through each awaken 'd vein , As skimming o'er the spacious plain , We look around with joyous eye , And view no boundaries but the sky . Already April 's reign is o'er , Her evening tints delight no more ; No more the violet scents the gale , No more the mist o'erspreads the vale ; The lovely queen of smiles and tears , Who gave thee birth , no more appears ; But blushing May , with brow serene , And vestments of a livelier green , Commands the winged choir to sing , And with wild notes the meadows ring . O come ! ere all the train is gone , No more to hail thy twenty-one ; That age which higher honor shares , And well becomes the wreath it wears . From lassitude and cities flee , And breathe the air of heav'n , with me .</docDate>

    <docDate><date>1795</date>. At an open window sitting , On this day of mirth and glee , ‘ Cross a flow'ry vista flitting , Many passing forms I see . Ah ! lovely prospect , stay awhile ! And longer glad my doating eye , With poverty 's delighted smile , And lighten 'd step , as passing by ; With labour 's spruce and ruddy train , Deck 'd out in all their best array , Who , months of toil and care disdain , Paid by the pleasures of a day . The village girl still let me view , Hast'ning to the neighb'ring fair ; Her cap adorn 'd with pink or blue , And nicely smooth her glossy hair . With sparkling eye and smiling face , Ting 'd o'er with beauty 's warmest glow ; With timid air , and Rumble grace , With clear and undepressed brow . Go ! lovely girl , and share the day , To thy industrious merit due ; There join the dance , or choral lay ; Thou blooming , village rose , adieu ! And thou , O youth , so blythe and free , Bounding swiftly o'er the plain , Go , taste the joys of liberty , And cheer thy spirit , happy swain ! How different to the lonely hour , When slowly following the plough , Self-buoyant joy forgets the pow'r , Which warms thy gladden 'd bosom now . If some rural prize desiring , Or ambitious of applause , Loud huzzas thy wishes firing , Thy steady hand the furrow draws ; Ne'er a victor fam 'd in story , Greater praise and reverence drew , Than thou , attir 'd in humble glory , So , guiltless conqueror , adieu ! Oh , here a charming group appears ! A cottage family , so gay , Whose youthful hopes , uncheck 'd by fears , In smiles of thoughtless rapture play . Here , borne in fond , parental arms , The infant 's roving eye we view ; Boasting a thousand , thousand charms , Endearing innocents , adieu ! They go ! no more with beating heart , And lively , dancing step to tread ; Unwillingly will they depart , To seek again their homely shed . Ah ! Eve , I love thy veil of grey , Which will conceal them from my view , For , bending home their weary way , How sad would be our last adieu ! The following was suggested by reading a whimsical description , given by Scarron , of the deformity of his person , contrasted with its former elegance , in the Curiosities of Literature , vol . 2 , page 247 . PHILEMON . Ye blooming youth , possest of every grace , Which can delight the eye , or please the ear , Who boast a polish 'd mind and faultless face , Awhile the councils of Philemon hear ! Let not pride lift the thoughtless head too high , Temerity arch o'er the scornful brow , Contemptuous glances arm the sparkling eye , Or the high heart with self-complacence glow ! Alas ! full soon the eve of life arrives , Though pale Disease 's train approach not nigh ; Short is the summer of the happiest lives , If no rude storm disturbs the smiling sky . This wretched body , bending to the earth , Once , on the wings of health , alert and gay , Shone forth the foremost in the train of mirth , And cloudless skies announc 'd a beauteous day . My parents oft , with fond complacence view 'd , The elegance of my external form ; And thought my mind with excellence endued , Bright as my genius , as my fancy warm . There was a time , poor as I now appear , I admiration met in every look ; And , harsh as now my words may grate your ear , Each tongue was silent when Philemon spoke . Once could this voice make every bosom thrill , As it pour 'd forth the light or plaintive lay ; And once these fingers , with superior skill , Upon the lute could eloquently play .</docDate>
    <docTitle><titlePart>By partial friendship sooth 'd , by flattery fann 'd , I learnt with conscious grace the dance to lead , To guide the Phaeton with careless hand , And rule , with flowing rein , the prancing steed . Sick with the glory of a trifler 's fame , By folly nurtur 'd , I was proud and vain ; Till Chastisement in kindest mercy came , Though then her just decrees I dar 'd arraign . The form that sought so late the public view , That glow 'd with transport , as the world admir 'd , Fill 'd with false shame , from every eye withdrew , And to the shades of solitude retir 'd . Consum 'd by fevers , spiritless , forlorn , Blasted by apoplexy 's dreadful rage , My bleeding heart by keen remembrance torn , I past my prime in premature old age . I heard my parent 's ill-suppressed sighs , And wish 'd myself upon the peaceful bier ; I saw the anguish of their sleepless eyes , The smile dissembled , and the secret tear . Oft , with a kind of gratifying woe , I recollected every former charm , And , with the spleen of a malicious foe , Delighted still to keep my sorrows warm . “ Where is the lustre of the gladsome eye , The airy smile , the animated mien , The rounding lip of liveliest crimson dye , So lately envied , now no longer seen . “ I too have gloried in my waving hair , No ringlets now remain to raise my pride ; Nor can I now lay the white forehead bare , And push the too luxuriant locks aside . ” Thus , like a child , I sigh 'd for pleasures past , And lost my hours in a delusive dream ; But Reason op 'd my blinded eyes at last , And clear 'd each mist by her refulgent beam . I saw futurity before me spread , A scourge or sceptre offer 'd to my view , Alarm 'd , from Folly 's erring mazes fled , And to my God with humble rev'rence drew . I bow 'd , submissive , at the holy shrine , His mercy with warm gratitude confest , Which had reveal 'd the spark of life divine , That slumber 'd in my earth-enamoured breast . Had I , as friendship and self-love desir 'd , Still suck 'd delirium at the fane of praise , I might , my conscience lull 'd and passions fir 'd , Have lost my soul in the bewitching blaze . Dear rising train , let not my words offend ! Nor the pure dictates of my love despise ; To one , late like yourselves , attention lend , And , taught by his experience , be wise ! Ah ! banish from your eye the fiend Disdain ; Let fair simplicity supply its place ; Nor longer let conceit the bosom stain ; The child of weakness , follow 'd by disgrace . Should time from you each glowing beauty wrest , You will not then those self-reproaches feel , Which every eye awaken 'd in my breast , And twenty winters scarce suffic 'd to heel . Nor will your friends observe each faded charm , Since still your countenance its smile retains , And the same lov 'd companion , kind and warm , With unassuming manners , yet remains .</titlePart></docTitle>

Yon coward , with the streaming hair , And visage , madden 'd to despair , With step convuls 'd , unsettled eye , And bosom lab'ring with a sigh , Is Guilt !— Behold , he hears the name , And starts with horror , fear , and shame ! See ! slow Suspicion by his side , With winking , microscopic eye ! And Mystery , his muffled guide , With fearful speech , and head awry . See ! scowling Malice there attend , Bold Falsehood , an apparent friend ; Avarice , repining o'er his pelf , Mean Cunning , lover of himself ; Hatred , the son of conscious Fear , Impatient Envy , with a fiend-like sneer , And shades of blasted Hopes , which still are hovering near ! All other woes will find relief , And time alleviate every grief ; Memory , though slowly , will decay , And Sorrow 's empire pass away . Awhile Misfortune may controul , And Fain oppress the virtuous soul , Yet Innocence can still beguile The patient sufferer of a smile , The beams of Hope may still dispense A grateful feeling to the sense ; Friendship may cast her arms around , And with fond tears embalm the wound , Or Piety 's soft incense rise , And waft reflection to the skies ; But those fell pangs which he endures , Nor Time forgets , nor Kindness cures ; Like Ocean 's waves , they still return , Like Etna 's fires , forever burn . Hound him no genial zephyrs fly , No fair horizon glads his eye , No joys to him does Nature yield , The solemn grove , or laughing field ; Though both with loud rejoicings ring , No pleasure does the echo bring , Not bubbling waters as they roll , Can tranquillize his bursting soul , For Conscience still , with tingling smart , Asserts his empire o'er his heart , And even when his eye-lids close , With clamourous scream affrights repose . Oppress 'd with light , he seeks to shun The splendid glories of the sun ; The busy crowds that hover near , Torment his eye , distract his ear ; He hastens to the secret shades , Where not a ray the gloom pervades ; Where Contemplation may retreat , And Silence take his mossy seat ; Yet even there no peace he knows , His fev'rish blood , no calmer flows ; Some hid assassins ‘ vengeful knife , Is rais 'd to end his wretched life . He shudders , starts , and stares around , With breathless fright , to catch the fancied sound ; Seeks for the dagger in his breast , And gripes it ‘ neath his ruffled vest . Lo ! now he plunges in the flood , To cleanse his garments , stain 'd with blood , His sanguine arm , in terror , laves ; But ah ! its hue defies the waves . Deprest , bewildered , thence he flies , And , to avoid Detection , tries , Who , frowning , still before him stands , The sword of Justice in her hands ; Abhorrent Scorn , unpitying Shame , And Punishments without a name , Still on her sounding steps attend , And every added horror lend . He turns away , with dread and fear , But the fell spectres still are near . Though Falsehood 's mazes see him wind ! Yet Infamy is close behind , Lifting her horn , with horrors fraught , Whose hideous yell is frenzy to the thought . Now , maniac-like , he comes again , And mixes with the jocund train ; But still those eyes that wildly roll , Bespeak the tempest in his soul . In yon deep cave he strives to rest , But Mem'ry harrows up his breast ; He clasps the goblet , foe to Care , And lo ! Distraction hovers there . Ah , hapless wretch ! condemn 'd to know , The sad varieties of woe ; Where'er thy footsteps turn , to meet , An earthquake yawning at thy feet , While o'er thy head pale meteors glare , And boding tempests fill the air , In throbbing anguish doom 'd to roam , Yet never find a peaceful home . Haste ! to the shrine of Mercy hie , There lift the penitential eye , With breaking heart thy sins deplore , And wound Integrity no more ! Repentance then thy soul shall save , And snatch thee , ransom 'd , from the grave . JULY<date>1796</date>. The death of Selred , last King of the East-Saxons , reduced that part of the Heptarchy to dependance on Mercia . The rest is imaginary . CEN'LIN , PRINCE OF MERCIA . When Britain many chiefs obey 'd , And seven Saxon princes sway 'd , The Mercian monarch , fam 'd afar , In peace respected , fear 'd in war , Favour 'd by heav'n above the rest , In his brave son was fully blest ; For none like Cen'lin did arise , So virtuous , elegant , and wise . Of partial Mercian eyes the joy , His parents idoliz 'd the boy ; Saw with just pride each op'ning grace , His charms of mind , of form , and face . And as he oft , with modest air , His thoughts and feelings did declare , His father would delighted hear , Would fondly drop the grateful tear ; And proudly cast his eyes around , But not an equal could be found . Warm from each lip applauses broke , And every tongue his praises spoke ; The list'ning courtiers spread his fame , And blessings follow 'd Cen'lins name . Now twenty summer 's suns had flown , And Mercia 's hopes were fully blown ; When ah ! conceal 'd in coarse disguise , To Selred 's<span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span>court their darling flies . Selred , his father 's scorn and hate , Became the ruler of his fate . There flatter 'd , lov 'd , the youth remain 'd , Till Cenulph 's threats his heir regain 'd . But ah ! no more the son of mirth , His pensive eye now sought the earth ; No more within the dance to move , Or list to sages , did he love ; But from surrounding friends would fly , To pour in solitude the sigh . And soon again the youth withdrew , Again to th ’ Eastern-Saxons flew . His father heard , opprest with woe , His aged heart forgot to glow ; He learnt his foes an army led , With youthful Cen'lin at their head , He call 'd his warriors forth to meet , And stretch the rebel at hit feet : Tears from his eyes in anguish broke , As thus the aged monarch spoke : “ Ye Mercians , let your banners fly ! The graceless youth this day shall die ! For , since he dares an army bring Against his father and his king , Though dear as life , I will not spare , Nor listen to affection 's pray'r ! If all my people should implore , I 'll pardon the rash boy no more ! His harden 'd heart , to duty blind , No ties of gratitude can bind ; This hoary head would else have rest , And pleasure warm this aching breast . Ah , cruel youth ! thy wrongs I feel , More deep than wounds of pointed steel . For , if forlorn the parent 's doom , Who bears his offspring to the tomb , Some comfort still his breast may know , Some soothing thought may calm his woe , And when he gives a loose to pain , He feels not that he mourns in vain , But fancies still his darling nigh , And grateful for each bursting sigh , Still bending o'er , with list'ning ear , Each weeping , fond complaint to hear , The dear-lov 'd phantom hovers round , And pours a balm in every wound . “ How doubly poignant is my smart , Bereaved of my Cen'lin ' s heart ! Exil 'd from that deluded breast , Where I had fondly hop 'd to rest , With faith undoubting , sweet repose , Till Death should bid my eye-lids close . And sometimes yet will hope arise ; Till now he ever scorn 'd disguise ; Some cursed fiend might taint his youth , And warp a temper form 'd for truth . When late he humbly knelt for grace , And clasp 'd my knees in close embrace , Upon his lips a secret hung , But something seem 'd to stay his tongue ; I prest not , for my anger slept , And fondness only saw he wept ; Ah ! fatal haste ! then had I known The serpent , I had sav 'd my son ! Yet surely pardon frank as mine , A noble heart would more confine ! When leaguing with my bitter foe , To strike some grand , decisive blow ; Perhaps to rob me of my throne , And make it , ere the time , his own ; Or , should wan guilt a danger dread , To humble this devoted head , Each throbbing pang of conscience drown , And seize , with bloody hands , the crown . O'er this offence I cast a veil , And fondly hush 'd the whisper 'd tale . Ah fool ! deluded by the grace , Of that fine form , and perfect face ; I thought his bosom free from sin , Nor dreamt a demon lurk 'd within . His voice , which ever could controul , Each passion of the hearer 's soul , With ease my partial heart beguil 'd , Who knew no sorrows when he smil 'd . And ah ! my friends , your downcast eyes , Your pensive air , and smother 'd sighs , All tell me you lament the fate , Of him , whom yet you cannot hate . And shall I bear then to behold , That form inanimate and cold , His smiling lips depriv 'd of breath , His eyes for ever clos 'd in death ! Ah no ! my heart with anguish swells , And every throbbing vein rebels . Let sorrow weep , or anger thrill , Yet all the parent triumphs still . “ Oh Father ! who in mercy reigns , If thy all-ruling will ordains , That my unhappy Cen'lin dies , Remove the picture from my eyes ! At the same moment set us free , Both rebel sons , my God , to thee ! ” Thus did the king pour forth his pray'r , With all the wildness of despair ; Then , stilling every rising sigh , He calm 'd the anguish of his eye , And though within the burthen lay , He wip 'd the falling tears away . When lo ! there comes a youthful train , Descending swiftly to the plain , Drest like the fairest sons of day , In floating robes and colours gay ; No crested helmets there appear , No glittering shield or pointed spear , But youths with honey-suckles crown 'd , Or their fair locks with fillets bound , Whose circling ranks and varied dyes , Shew 'd like the bow , that gilds the skies . Whilst in the van a pair were seen , Of peerless charms and graceful mien ; One lovely form the Mercians knew , And gladden 'd at the pleasing view , Who , with the glow of youthful prime , Had all the majesty of time . And beauteous was the fair he led , As any fabled Grecian maid ; The nymphs who tend Aurora 's car , And usher in the morning star , Though made inhabitants of air , Were not more elegant and fair ; Nor Dian 's ever-healthful train , When skimming o'er the spacious plain . Had not more pure , more lively dyes , Or brighter lustre in their eyes . The king , so late by woe deprest , Felt hope reanimate his breast , And as his Cen'lin nearer drew , His waking hopes more vivid grew . “ My friends , ” he cried , “ will you believe , That open mien can e'er deceive ? That blooming , form can e'er unfold , A heart ungenerous and cold , That melting softness of the eye , Can harbour direst cruelty ? Ah no ! a poison 's baleful pow'r , Lurks not beneath so fair a flow'r . Nor are those youths with amber hair , Such as fell treason would prepare , An aged monarch to dethrone , And hear , unmov 'd , a father 's groan . Gay are their looks , no dark disguise , Dims the mild radiance of their eyes ; No murderous thoughts their souls employ , But , heralds of transporting joy , They come to bid suspicion cease , And sooth my sorrow into peace . ” Caution could scarce awhile controul The strong delights of Cenulph 's soul , When Cen'lin knelt , and by his side Half-kneeling , bent his lovely bride . But , when he first essay 'd to speak , A hasty blush pass 'd o'er his cheek , He hung awhile his graceful head , Till thus , with air confus 'd he said : “ I come , by love with honours crown 'd , Yet sorrow casts a shade around , That when my consort here I bring , The heiress of a potent king , The Mercians , clad in armour , come , To lead their princess to her home . No joyful hail our nuptial greets , No proof of love my Ela meets , But scarlet banners , waving high , The bridal knot and wreath supply . Alas ! I see mistrust has won E'en Cenulph 's fondness from his son ; Or could my ever-honour 'd sire , A proof of Cen'lin ' s faith require ? Can force so needful now appear , To aid a pow'r which I revere ? When eager beauty 's form to view , I first to Selred 's court withdrew , A single wish thy pow'r maintain 'd , A single wish thy son regain 'd . I left the maid whose matchless charms , Each rooted prejudice disarms , Who rul 'd my heart with sovereign sway , And taught a Mercian to obey Laws that East-Saxons can impart , When wit and beauty string the dart ; Left her when hope my doubts beguil 'd , And on our love her father smil 'd . Oft have I tried to win thine ear , The fond , romantic tale to hear , But when I found a lonely hour , My coward soul has lost the pow'r ; As on my lips the accents hung , Thy hate to Selred check 'd my tongue . Yet flattering hopes my passion fed , And from thy court again I fled ; I thought when you my fair beheld , And knew how greatly she excell 'd , In every charm , each art refin 'd , And virtue of the female mind , Thy judgment would approve my choice , And bless it with a cheerful voice . And ah ! though fortune did combine With love , in making Ela mine , I cannot from a grief refrain , Remembering that I gave thee pain . Yet if thy Cen'lin e'er could please , If e'er my cares could give thee ease , Let mild affection now arise , And beam forgiveness from thine eyes ! No more thy son shall make thee know A pain , or give thee cause of woe . No nights the Mercians have to fear , For all I love is center 'd here , ” He spoke , and o'er his father 's soul , A stream of healing comfort stole ; He rose , with slow , majestic grace , Tears of delight adorn 'd his face , His pious heart with rapture glow 'd , And joy a second youth bestow 'd . “ To meet thee thus , my son , ” he cried , “ This peerless maiden for your bride , Bids each distressing thought depart , And joy again possess my heart . Fair princess , thine the happy fate , To heal the wounds of mutual hate ; No longer shall this bosom know , An Eastern-Saxon as my foe ; And she , who bids that passion rest , Doubt not , shall be supremely blest ; The part is holy and benign , Befitting such a form as thine . This day , far dearer than before , Kind heav'n does twice my son restore , For by those speaking looks I see , Another valued child in thee . ” As then he raised them to his breast , Around the joyful Mercians prest , And made their shouts of triumph rise , To the fair concave of the skies .

Lo ! here a cloud comes sailing , richly clad In royal purple , which the parting beams Of bounteous Phoebus edge with tints of gold And lucid crimson . One might fancy it A noble bird , that laves its graceful form , And bathes its rosy bosom in the light . Look ! how it swells and rears its snowy crest With haughty grandeur ; while the blue expanse , In smiling patience lets the boaster pass , And swell his train with all the lazy vapours That hover in the air : an easy prey To the gigantic phantom , whose curl 'd wing , Sweeps in these worthless triflers of the sky , And wraps them in his bosom . Go , vain shadow ! Sick with the burthen of thy fancied greatness , A breath of zephyr wafts thee into nothing , Scatters thy spreading plumes , uncrowns thy front , And drives thee downward to thy mother earth , To mix with vapour and dissolve in dew . Such are the dreams of hope , which to the eye Of youthful inexperience , seem to touch The pure , unclouded sky of certainty . Buoy 'd up by the fond eloquence of thought , And nurtur 'd by the smile of vanity , Each hour the air-born vision gathers bulk , And Fancy decks it with a thousand hues , Varied and wild , till it abounds in charms Which sink the soul to sadness , when the breath Of gentle Reason breaks the beauteous bubble , And leaves us nought but vain regret behind .

There will , at some far-distant spot , A streak of light appear , Or , when the sullen vapours break , The ether will be clear . And if the sun illumes the east , And sheds his gladsome ray , Some boding mist , or passing cloud Will threat the rising day . The heart rejoicing in the view , And dancing with delight , Oft feels the touch of palsied fear , And sinks at thought of night . So Hope 's bright torch more clearly shines , Amidst surrounding gloom , And , beldame Fortune vainly throws Her mantle o'er the tomb . MARCH 15 ,<date>1797</date>. THE COMPLAINT OF FANCY . To A. R.

As , musing , late I sat reclin 'd , And waking dreams absorb 'd my mind , A damsel came , of various dyes , Like painted Iris from the skies ; A purfled saffron was her vest , And sweet gum-cistus form 'd her crest ; In many a playful ring , her hair Flew light and flossy in the air ; The mantle , blue and gold , she wore , A rose of opals held before , While , graceful in her fairy hand , Appear 'd a crimson-tufted wand , Whose shade on every object threw A glowing tint of roseate hue . “ Whence art thou , blooming nymph ? ” I cried , And thus a tuneful voice replied : “ Men call me Fancy ; at my shrine Myriads confess my power divine ; There painters bend the willing knee , And laurell 'd poets sue to me : For mine is every vivid ray , Which partial Nature gave the day ; And , to the music of my song , A thousand nameless charms belong . “ The friend of Happiness , I dwell Belov 'd alike in court or cell ; Where Glory lifts her ardent eye , With hasty , kindred zeal I fly , In sun-beams place the hero 's form , And bid his arm command the storm ; On swelling clouds an altar raise , And fan the tow'ring flame of praise . “ Oft , from the lorn enthusiast 's lyre , My fingers strike etherial fire , And give to sounds of piercing woe , Extatic rapture 's fervent glow . Oft sooth the maniac 's throbbing vein , And grace her simple , wilder 'd strain ; The tribe of Pain in fetters keep , Lull wounded Memory to sleep , And , in the mind of gloomy Care , Bid Thought an angel 's semblance wear . “ Dear to each blest aerial pow'r , E'en Wisdom calls me to her bow'r ; My songs her leisure hours beguile , And teach her holy lip to smile . And , when the Muse , with thoughtful care , Has woven chaplets for her hair , I let her , with her myrtles , twine , Full many a fragrant rose of mine . “ Then why , since all the wise and gay , To me a grateful homage pay , Since I to all my hand extend , And , liberal , every heart befriend , Does Nancy from the croud retire , And rend my blossoms from her lyre ? Though every string the loss bewail , And tones of mellow sweetness fail , Which us 'd to charm the pensive ear , When list'ning Friendship bent to hear . “ Tell her I wish not to intrude Upon her sacred solitude , Nor cast my undulating chain , Around her glowing heart again ; No ! every claim I now resign , Yet let some small regard be mine ; Let one , who nurs 'd her infant years , And wip 'd away some bitter tears , Still animate the scenes around , And make her tread on fairy ground ; Give playful sweetness to each lay , And decorate the passing day . “ Tell her , if now she scorns my strain , She may invoke my name in vain ; In vain my proffered aid implore , Contemn 'd , I hardly pardon more . ” She said , and springing from the earth , Attending found her suitor Mirth , Who caught her hand , with lively air , And plac 'd her in his silver chair , Which through the yielding ether flew , And quickly bore them from my view .</docImprint>
