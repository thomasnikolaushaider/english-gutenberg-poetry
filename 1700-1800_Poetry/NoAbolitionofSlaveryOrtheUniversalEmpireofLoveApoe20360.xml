   <note>FOOTNOTES : { 1 } Had he the command of thunder , there can be no doubt that he would long before now have cleared a troublesome quarter . { 2 } Sedet eternumque sedebit Infelix Theseus . VIRG . { 3 } If the abettors of the Slave trade Bill should think they are too harshly treated in this Poem , let them consider how they should feel if their estates were threatened by an agrarian law ; ( no unplausible measure ) and let them make allowances for the irritation which themselves have occasioned . { 4 } That the Africans are in a state of savage wretchedness , appears from the most authentic accounts . Such being the fact , an abolition of the slave trade would in truth be precluding them from the first step towards progressive civilization , and consequently of happiness , which it is proved by the most respectable evidence they enjoy in a great degree in our West-India islands , though under well-regulated restraint . The clamour which is raised against this change of their situation , reminds us of the following passage in one of the late Mr. Hall 's ‘ Fables for Grown Gentlemen . ’ “ ‘ Tis thus the Highlander complains , ‘ Tis thus the Union they abuse , For binding their backsides in chains , And shackling their feet in shoes ; For giving them both food and fuel , And comfortable cloaths , Instead of cruel oatmeal gruel , Instead of rags and heritable blows . ” { 5 } The question now agitated in the British Parliament concerning slavery , is illustrated with great information , able argument , and perspicuous expression , in a work entitled , “ Doubts on the Abolition of the Slave Trade , by an Old Member of Parliament ; ” printed for Stockdale , in Picadilly , 1790 . It is ascribed to John Ranby , Esq . That the evils of the Slave Trade should , like the evils incident to other departments of civil subordination , be humanely remedied as much as may be , every good man is convinced ; and accordingly we find that great advances have been gradually made in that respect , as may be seen in various publications , particularly the evidence taken before the Privy-Council . It must be admitted , that in the course of the present imprudent and dangerous attempt to bring about a total abolition , one essential advantage has been obtained , namely , a better mode of carrying the slaves from Africa to the West-Indies ; but surely this might have been had in a less violent manner . { 6 } Diogenes being discovered in the street in fond intercourse with one of those pretty misses whom Sir William Dolben dislikes , steadily said , “ { Greek : Phytenô Andras }— I plant men . ” { 7 } Manchester Petition . { 8 } Some of the Scottish Presbyteries petitioned . { 9 } Risum teneatis amici . HORAT . { 10 } When I forget HIM , may GOD forget me ! { 11 } Mira cano , Sol occubuit , nox nulla sequuta . See CAMDEN 'S REMAINS . { 12 } The state of slavery is acknowledged both in the Old Testament and the New . { 13 } The great Dr. Bentley was Mr. Cumberland 's grandfather . { 14 } Mr. Cumberland is a descendant of Bishop Cumberland , who wrote De legibus Naturæ . { 15 } Messieurs Carpmeal , Macmanus , Jealous , and Townshend , gentlemen of the Publick Office , in Bow-Street . { 16 } Sir William Young has a series of pictures , in which the negroes in our plantations are justly and pleasingly exhibited in various scenes . { 17 } The Angola blacks are the most ferocious . The author does not boast , like Abyssinian Yakoob , “ of no ungracious figure ": nor does he , like another beau garçon , Mr. Gibbon , prefix his pleasing countenance to captivate the ladies .</note>
