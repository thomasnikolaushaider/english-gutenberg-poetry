    <head>THE ARGUMENT . { 1 }</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Books afford Consolation to the troubled Mind by substituting a</l>
     <l n="2">lighter kind of Distress for its own — They are productive of other</l>
     <l n="3">Advantages — An Author 's Hope of being known in distant times —</l>
     <l n="4">Arrangement of the Library — Size and Form of the Volumes — The</l>
     <l n="5">ancient Folio , clasped and chained — Fashion prevalent even in this</l>
     <l n="6">Place — The Mode of publishing in Numbers , Pamphlets &amp; c .— Subjects of</l>
     <l n="7">the different Classes — Divinity — Controversy — The Friends of</l>
     <l n="8">Religion often more dangerous than her Foes — Sceptical Authors —</l>
     <l n="9">Reason too much rejected by the former Converts ; exclusively relied</l>
     <l n="10">upon by the latter — Philosophy ascending through the Scale of Being</l>
     <l n="11">to Moral Subjects — Books of Medicine : their Variety , Variance , and</l>
     <l n="12">Proneness to System : the Evil of this , and the Difficulty it</l>
     <l n="13">causes — Farewell to this Study — Law : the increasing Number of its</l>
     <l n="14">Volumes — Supposed happy State of Man without Laws — Progress of</l>
     <l n="15">Society — Historians : their Subjects — Dramatic Authors , Tragic and</l>
     <l n="16">Comic — Ancient Romances — The Captive Heroine — Happiness in the</l>
     <l n="17">perusal of such Books : why — Criticism — Apprehensions of the Author :</l>
     <l n="18">removed by the Appearance of the Genius of the Place ; whose</l>
     <l n="19">Reasoning and Admonition conclude the subject .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="20">When the sad soul , by care and grief oppress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="21">Looks round the world , but looks in vain for rest ;</l>
     <l n="22">When every object that appears in view</l>
     <l n="23">Partakes her gloom and seems dejected too ;</l>
     <l n="24">Where shall affliction from itself retire ?</l>
     <l n="25">Where fade away and placidly expire ?</l>
     <l n="26">Alas ! we fly to silent scenes in vain ;</l>
     <l n="27">Care blasts the honours of the flow'ry plain :</l>
     <l n="28">Care veils in clouds the sun 's meridian beam ,</l>
     <l n="29">Sighs through the grove , and murmurs in the stream ;</l>
     <l n="30">For when the soul is labouring in despair ,</l>
     <l n="31">In vain the body breathes a purer air :</l>
     <l n="32">No storm-tost sailor sighs for slumbering seas , -</l>
     <l n="33">He dreads the tempest , but invokes the breeze ;</l>
     <l n="34">On the smooth mirror of the deep resides</l>
     <l n="35">Reflected woe , and o'er unruffled tides</l>
     <l n="36">The ghost of every former danger glides .</l>
     <l n="37">Thus , in the calms of life , we only see</l>
     <l n="38">A steadier image of our misery ;</l>
     <l n="39">But lively gales and gently clouded skies</l>
     <l n="40">Disperse the sad reflections as they rise ;</l>
     <l n="41">And busy thoughts and little cares avail</l>
     <l n="42">To ease the mind , when rest and reason fail .</l>
     <l n="43">When the dull thought , by no designs employ 'd ,</l>
     <l n="44">Dwells on the past , or suffer 'd or enjoy 'd ,</l>
     <l n="45">We bleed anew in every former grief ,</l>
     <l n="46">And joys departed furnish no relief .</l>
     <l n="47">Not Hope herself , with all her flattering art ,</l>
     <l n="48">Can cure this stubborn sickness of the heart :</l>
     <l n="49">The soul disdains each comfort she prepares ,</l>
     <l n="50">And anxious searches for congenial cares ;</l>
     <l n="51">Those lenient cares , which with our own combined ,</l>
     <l n="52">By mix 'd sensations ease th ’ afflicted mind ,</l>
     <l n="53">And steal our grief away , and leave their own behind ;</l>
     <l n="54">A lighter grief ! which feeling hearts endure</l>
     <l n="55">Without regret , nor e'en demand a cure .</l>
     <l n="56">But what strange art , what magic can dispose</l>
     <l n="57">The troubled mind to change its native woes ?</l>
     <l n="58">Or lead us willing from ourselves , to see</l>
     <l n="59">Others more wretched , more undone than we ?</l>
     <l n="60">This BOOKS can do ;— nor this alone ; they give</l>
     <l n="61">New views to life , and teach us how to live ;</l>
     <l n="62">They soothe the grieved , the stubborn they chastise ,</l>
     <l n="63">Fools they admonish , and confirm the wise :</l>
     <l n="64">Their aid they yield to all : they never shun</l>
     <l n="65">The man of sorrow , nor the wretch undone :</l>
     <l n="66">Unlike the hard , the selfish , and the proud ,</l>
     <l n="67">They fly not sullen from the suppliant crowd ;</l>
     <l n="68">Nor tell to various people various things ,</l>
     <l n="69">But show to subjects what they show to kings .</l>
     <l n="70">Come , Child of Care ! to make thy soul serene ,</l>
     <l n="71">Approach the treasures of this tranquil scene ;</l>
     <l n="72">Survey the dome , and , as the doors unfold ,</l>
     <l n="73">The soul 's best cure , in all her cares , behold !</l>
     <l n="74">Where mental wealth the poor in thought may find ,</l>
     <l n="75">And mental physic the diseased in mind ;</l>
     <l n="76">See here the balms that passion 's wounds assuage ;</l>
     <l n="77">See coolers here , that damp the fire of rage ;</l>
     <l n="78">Here alt'ratives , by slow degrees control</l>
     <l n="79">The chronic habits of the sickly soul ;</l>
     <l n="80">And round the heart and o'er the aching head ,</l>
     <l n="81">Mild opiates here their sober influence shed .</l>
     <l n="82">Now bid thy soul man 's busy scenes exclude ,</l>
     <l n="83">And view composed this silent multitude : -</l>
     <l n="84">Silent they are — but though deprived of sound ,</l>
     <l n="85">Here all the living languages abound ;</l>
     <l n="86">Here all that live no more ; preserved they lie ,</l>
     <l n="87">In tombs that open to the curious eye .</l>
     <l n="88">Blest be the gracious Power , who taught mankind</l>
     <l n="89">To stamp a lasting image of the mind !</l>
     <l n="90">Beasts may convey , and tuneful birds may sing ,</l>
     <l n="91">Their mutual feelings , in the opening spring ;</l>
     <l n="92">But Man alone has skill and power to send</l>
     <l n="93">The heart 's warm dictates to the distant friend ;</l>
     <l n="94">‘ Tis his alone to please , instruct , advise</l>
     <l n="95">Ages remote , and nations yet to rise .</l>
     <l n="96">In sweet repose , when Labour 's children sleep ,</l>
     <l n="97">When Joy forgets to smile and Care to weep ,</l>
     <l n="98">When Passion slumbers in the lover 's breast ,</l>
     <l n="99">And Fear and Guilt partake the balm of rest ,</l>
     <l n="100">Why then denies the studious man to share</l>
     <l n="101">Man 's common good , who feels his common care ?</l>
     <l n="102">Because the hope is his , that bids him fly</l>
     <l n="103">Night 's soft repose , and sleep 's mild power defy ;</l>
     <l n="104">That after-ages may repeat his praise ,</l>
     <l n="105">And fame 's fair meed be his , for length of days .</l>
     <l n="106">Delightful prospect ! when we leave behind</l>
     <l n="107">A worthy offspring of the fruitful mind !</l>
     <l n="108">Which , born and nursed through many an anxious day ,</l>
     <l n="109">Shall all our labour , all our care repay .</l>
     <l n="110">Yet all are not these births of noble kind ,</l>
     <l n="111">Not all the children of a vigorous mind ;</l>
     <l n="112">But where the wisest should alone preside ,</l>
     <l n="113">The weak would rule us , and the blind would guide ;</l>
     <l n="114">Nay , man 's best efforts taste of man , and show</l>
     <l n="115">The poor and troubled source from which they flow ;</l>
     <l n="116">Where most he triumphs we his wants perceive ,</l>
     <l n="117">And for his weakness in his wisdom grieve .</l>
     <l n="118">But though imperfect all ; yet wisdom loves</l>
     <l n="119">This seat serene , and virtue 's self approves : -</l>
     <l n="120">Here come the grieved , a change of thought to find ;</l>
     <l n="121">The curious here to feed a craving mind ;</l>
     <l n="122">Here the devout their peaceful temple choose ;</l>
     <l n="123">And here the poet meets his favouring Muse .</l>
     <l n="124">With awe , around these silent walks I tread ;</l>
     <l n="125">These are the lasting mansions of the dead : -</l>
     <l n="126">“ The dead ! ” methinks a thousand tongues reply ;</l>
     <l n="127">“ These are the tombs of such as cannot die ! ”</l>
     <l n="128">Crown 'd with eternal fame , they sit sublime ,</l>
     <l n="129">“ And laugh at all the little strife of time . ”</l>
     <l n="130">Hail , then , immortals ! ye who shine above ,</l>
     <l n="131">Each , in his sphere , the literary Jove ;</l>
     <l n="132">And ye the common people of these skies ,</l>
     <l n="133">A humbler crowd of nameless deities ;</l>
     <l n="134">Whether ‘ tis yours to lead the willing mind</l>
     <l n="135">Through History 's mazes , and the turnings find ;</l>
     <l n="136">Or , whether led by Science , ye retire ,</l>
     <l n="137">Lost and bewilder 'd in the vast desire ;</l>
     <l n="138">Whether the Muse invites you to her bowers ,</l>
     <l n="139">And crowns your placid brows with living flowers ;</l>
     <l n="140">Or godlike Wisdom teaches you to show</l>
     <l n="141">The noblest road to happiness below ;</l>
     <l n="142">Or men and manners prompt the easy page</l>
     <l n="143">To mark the flying follies of the age :</l>
     <l n="144">Whatever good ye boast , that good impart ;</l>
     <l n="145">Inform the head and rectify the heart .</l>
     <l n="146">Lo , all in silence , all in order stand ,</l>
     <l n="147">And mighty folios first , a lordly band ;</l>
     <l n="148">Then quartos their well-order 'd ranks maintain ,</l>
     <l n="149">And light octavos fill a spacious plain :</l>
     <l n="150">See yonder , ranged in more frequented rows ,</l>
     <l n="151">A humbler band of duodecimos ;</l>
     <l n="152">While undistinguish 'd trifles swell the scene ,</l>
     <l n="153">The last new play and fritter 'd magazine .</l>
     <l n="154">Thus ‘ tis in life , where first the proud , the great ,</l>
     <l n="155">In leagued assembly keep their cumbrous state ;</l>
     <l n="156">Heavy and huge , they fill the world with dread ,</l>
     <l n="157">Are much admired , and are but little read :</l>
     <l n="158">The commons next , a middle rank , are found ;</l>
     <l n="159">Professions fruitful pour their offspring round ;</l>
     <l n="160">Reasoners and wits are next their place allowed ,</l>
     <l n="161">And last , of vulgar tribes a countless crowd .</l>
     <l n="162">First , let us view the form , the size , the dress ;</l>
     <l n="163">For these the manners , nay the mind , express :</l>
     <l n="164">That weight of wood , with leathern coat o'erlaid ;</l>
     <l n="165">Those ample clasps , of solid metal made ;</l>
     <l n="166">The close-press 'd leaves , unclosed for many an age ;</l>
     <l n="167">The dull red edging of the well-fill 'd page ;</l>
     <l n="168">On the broad back the stubborn ridges roll 'd ,</l>
     <l n="169">Where yet the title stands in tarnish 'd gold ;</l>
     <l n="170">These all a sage and labour 'd work proclaim ,</l>
     <l n="171">A painful candidate for lasting fame :</l>
     <l n="172">No idle wit , no trifling verse can lurk</l>
     <l n="173">In the deep bosom of that weighty work ;</l>
     <l n="174">No playful thoughts degrade the solemn style ,</l>
     <l n="175">Nor one light sentence claims a transient smile .</l>
     <l n="176">Hence , in these times , untouch 'd the pages lie ,</l>
     <l n="177">And slumber out their immortality :</l>
     <l n="178">They HAD their day , when , after after all his toil ,</l>
     <l n="179">His morning study , and his midnight oil ,</l>
     <l n="180">At length an author 's ONE great work appeared ,</l>
     <l n="181">By patient hope , and length of days , endear 'd :</l>
     <l n="182">Expecting nations hail 'd it from the press ;</l>
     <l n="183">Poetic friends prefix 'd each kind address ;</l>
     <l n="184">Princes and kings received the pond'rous gift ,</l>
     <l n="185">And ladies read the work they could not lift .</l>
     <l n="186">Fashion , though Folly 's child , and guide of fools ,</l>
     <l n="187">Rules e'en the wisest , and in learning rules ;</l>
     <l n="188">From crowds and courts to “ Wisdom 's seat she goes</l>
     <l n="189">And reigns triumphant o'er her mother 's foes .</l>
     <l n="190">For lo ! these fav'rites of the ancient mode</l>
     <l n="191">Lie all neglected like the Birthday Ode .</l>
     <l n="192">Ah ! needless now this weight of massy chain ; { 2 }</l>
     <l n="193">Safe in themselves , the once-loved works remain ;</l>
     <l n="194">No readers now invade their still retreat ,</l>
     <l n="195">None try to steal them from their parent-seat ;</l>
     <l n="196">Like ancient beauties , they may now discard</l>
     <l n="197">Chains , bolts , and locks , and lie without a guard .</l>
     <l n="198">Our patient fathers trifling themes laid by ,</l>
     <l n="199">And roll 'd , o'er labour 'd works , th ’ attentive eye :</l>
     <l n="200">Page after page the much-enduring men</l>
     <l n="201">Explored the deeps and shallows of the pen :</l>
     <l n="202">Till , every former note and comment known ,</l>
     <l n="203">They mark 'd the spacious margin with their own ;</l>
     <l n="204">Minute corrections proved their studious care ;</l>
     <l n="205">The little index , pointing , told us where ;</l>
     <l n="206">And many an emendation show 'd the age</l>
     <l n="207">Look 'd far beyond the rubric title-page .</l>
     <l n="208">Our nicer palates lighter labours seek ,</l>
     <l n="209">Cloy 'd with a folio-NUMBER once a week ;</l>
     <l n="210">Bibles , with cuts and comments , thus go down :</l>
     <l n="211">E'en light Voltaire is NUMBER 'D through the town :</l>
     <l n="212">Thus physic flies abroad , and thus the law ,</l>
     <l n="213">From men of study , and from men of straw ;</l>
     <l n="214">Abstracts , abridgments , please the fickle times ,</l>
     <l n="215">Pamphlets and plays , and politics and rhymes :</l>
     <l n="216">But though to write be now a task of ease ,</l>
     <l n="217">The task is hard by manly arts to please ,</l>
     <l n="218">When all our weakness is exposed to view ,</l>
     <l n="219">And half our judges are our rivals too .</l>
     <l n="220">Amid these works , on which the eager eye</l>
     <l n="221">Delights to fix , or glides reluctant by ,</l>
     <l n="222">When all combined , their decent pomp display ,</l>
     <l n="223">Where shall we first our early offering pay ?</l>
     <l n="224">To thee , DIVINITY ! to thee , the light</l>
     <l n="225">And guide of mortals , through their mental night ;</l>
     <l n="226">By whom we learn our hopes and fears to guide ;</l>
     <l n="227">To bear with pain , and to contend with pride ;</l>
     <l n="228">When grieved , to pray ; when injured , to forgive ;</l>
     <l n="229">And with the world in charity to live .</l>
     <l n="230">Not truths like these inspired that numerous race ,</l>
     <l n="231">Whose pious labours fill this ample space ;</l>
     <l n="232">But questions nice , where doubt on doubt arose ,</l>
     <l n="233">Awaked to war the long-contending foes .</l>
     <l n="234">For dubious meanings , learned polemics strove ,</l>
     <l n="235">And wars on faith prevented works of love ;</l>
     <l n="236">The brands of discord far around were hurl 'd ,</l>
     <l n="237">And holy wrath inflamed a sinful world : -</l>
     <l n="238">Dull though impatient , peevish though devout ,</l>
     <l n="239">With wit disgusting , and despised without ;</l>
     <l n="240">Saints in design , in execution men ,</l>
     <l n="241">Peace in their looks , and vengeance in their pen .</l>
     <l n="242">Methinks I see , and sicken at the sight ,</l>
     <l n="243">Spirits of spleen from yonder pile alight ;</l>
     <l n="244">Spirits who prompted every damning page ,</l>
     <l n="245">With pontiff pride and still-increasing rage :</l>
     <l n="246">Lo ! how they stretch their gloomy wings around ,</l>
     <l n="247">And lash with furious strokes the trembling ground !</l>
     <l n="248">They pray , they fight , they murder , and they weep , -</l>
     <l n="249">Wolves in their vengeance , in their manners sheep ;</l>
     <l n="250">Too well they act the prophet 's fatal part ,</l>
     <l n="251">Denouncing evil with a zealous heart ;</l>
     <l n="252">And each , like Jonah , is displeased if God</l>
     <l n="253">Repent his anger , or withhold his rod .</l>
     <l n="254">But here the dormant fury rests unsought ,</l>
     <l n="255">And Zeal sleeps soundly by the foes she fought ;</l>
     <l n="256">Here all the rage of controversy ends ,</l>
     <l n="257">And rival zealots rest like bosom-friends :</l>
     <l n="258">An Athanasian here , in deep repose ,</l>
     <l n="259">Sleeps with the fiercest of his Arian foes ;</l>
     <l n="260">Socinians here with Calvinists abide ,</l>

     <l n="333">Warm the glad heart or vex the labouring brain ;</l>
     <l n="334">But as the green blood moves along the blade ,</l>
     <l n="335">The bed of Flora on the branch is made ;</l>
     <l n="336">Where , without passion love instinctive lives ,</l>

     <l n="353">Without the cares and dangers of the great ,</l>

     <l n="359">Some , lured by vice , indulge the low desire ;</l>

     <l n="563">And greet — the ancient worthies of ROMANCE .</l>
     <l n="564">Hence , ye profane ! I feel a former dread ,</l>
     <l n="565">A thousand visions float around my head :</l>
     <l n="566">Hark ! hollow blasts through empty courts resound ,</l>
     <l n="567">And shadowy forms with staring eyes stalk round ;</l>
     <l n="568">See ! moats and bridges , walls and castles rise ,</l>
     <l n="569">Ghosts , fairies , demons , dance before our eyes ;</l>
     <l n="570">Lo ! magic verse inscribed on golden gate ,</l>
     <l n="571">And bloody hand that beckons on to fate : -</l>
     <l n="572">“ And who art thou , thou little page , unfold ?</l>
     <l n="573">Say , doth thy lord my Claribel withhold ?</l>
     <l n="574">Go tell him straight , Sir Knight , thou must resign</l>
     <l n="575">The captive queen ;— for Claribel is mine . ”</l>
     <l n="576">Away he flies ; and now for bloody deeds ,</l>
     <l n="577">Black suits of armour , masks , and foaming steeds ;</l>
     <l n="578">The giant falls ; his recreant throat I seize ,</l>
     <l n="579">And from his corslet take the massy keys : -</l>
     <l n="580">Dukes , lords , and knights , in long procession move ,</l>
     <l n="581">Released from bondage with my virgin love : -</l>
     <l n="582">She comes ! she comes ! in all the charms of youth ,</l>
     <l n="583">Unequall 'd love , and unsuspected truth !</l>
     <l n="584">Ah ! happy he who thus , in magic themes ,</l>
     <l n="585">O'er worlds bewitch 'd , in early rapture dreams ,</l>
     <l n="586">Where wild Enchantment waves her potent wand ,</l>
     <l n="587">And Fancy 's beauties fill her fairy land ;</l>
     <l n="588">Where doubtful objects strange desires excite ,</l>
     <l n="589">And Fear and Ignorance afford delight .</l>
     <l n="590">But lost , for ever lost , to me these joys ,</l>
     <l n="591">Which Reason scatters , and which Time destroys ;</l>
     <l n="592">Too dearly bought : maturer judgment calls</l>
     <l n="593">My busied mind from tales and madrigals ;</l>
     <l n="594">My doughty giants all are slain or fled ,</l>
     <l n="595">And all my knignts — blue , green , and yellow — dead !</l>
     <l n="596">No more the midnight fairy tribe I view ,</l>
     <l n="597">All in the merry moonshine tippling dew ;</l>
     <l n="598">E'en the last lingering fiction of the brain ,</l>
     <l n="599">The churchyard ghost , is now at rest again ;</l>
     <l n="600">And all these wayward wanderings of my youth</l>
     <l n="601">Fly Reason 's power , and shun the light of Truth .</l>
     <l n="602">With Fiction then does real joy reside ,</l>
     <l n="603">And is our reason the delusive guide ?</l>
     <l n="604">Is it then right to dream the syrens sing ?</l>
     <l n="605">Or mount enraptured on the dragon 's wing ?</l>
     <l n="606">No ; ‘ tis the infant mind , to care unknown ,</l>
     <l n="607">That makes th ’ imagined paradise its own ;</l>
     <l n="608">Soon as reflections in the bosom rise ,</l>
     <l n="609">Light slumbers vanish from the clouded eyes :</l>
     <l n="610">The tear and smile , that once together rose ,</l>
     <l n="611">Are then divorced ; the head and heart are foes :</l>
     <l n="612">Enchantment bows to Wisdom 's serious plan ,</l>
     <l n="613">And Pain and Prudence make and mar the man .</l>
     <l n="614">While thus , of power and fancied empire vain ,</l>
     <l n="615">With various thoughts my mind I entertain ;</l>
     <l n="616">While books , my slaves , with tyrant hand I seize ,</l>
     <l n="617">Pleased with the pride that will not let them please ,</l>
     <l n="618">Sudden I find terrific thoughts arise ,</l>
     <l n="619">And sympathetic sorrow fills my eyes ;</l>
     <l n="620">For , lo ! while yet my heart admits the wound ,</l>
     <l n="621">I see the CRITIC army ranged around .</l>
     <l n="622">Foes to our race ! if ever ye have known</l>
     <l n="623">A father 's fears for offspring of your own ;</l>
     <l n="624">If ever , smiling o'er a lucky line ,</l>
     <l n="625">Ye thought the sudden sentiment divine ,</l>
     <l n="626">Then paused and doubted , and then , tired of doubt ,</l>
     <l n="627">With rage as sudden dash 'd the stanza out ; -</l>
     <l n="628">If , after fearing much and pausing long ,</l>
     <l n="629">Ye ventured on the world your labour 'd song ,</l>
     <l n="630">And from the crusty critics of those days</l>
     <l n="631">Implored the feeble tribute of their praise ;</l>
     <l n="632">Remember now the fears that moved you then ,</l>
     <l n="633">And , spite of truth , let mercy guide your pen .</l>
     <l n="634">What vent'rous race are ours ! what mighty foes</l>
     <l n="635">Lie waiting all around them to oppose !</l>
     <l n="636">What treacherous friends betray them to the fight !</l>
     <l n="637">What dangers threaten them — yet still they write :</l>
     <l n="638">A hapless tribe ! to every evil born ,</l>
     <l n="639">Whom villains hate , and fools affect to scorn :</l>
     <l n="640">Strangers they come , amid a world of woe ,</l>
     <l n="641">And taste the largest portion ere they go .</l>
     <l n="642">Pensive I spoke , and cast mine eyes around ;</l>
     <l n="643">The roof , methought , return 'd a solemn sound ;</l>
     <l n="644">Each column seem 'd to shake , and clouds , like smoke ,</l>
     <l n="645">From dusty piles and ancient volumes broke ;</l>
     <l n="646">Gathering above , like mists condensed they seem ,</l>
     <l n="647">Exhaled in summer from the rushy stream ;</l>
     <l n="648">Like flowing robes they now appear , and twine</l>
     <l n="649">Round the large members of a form divine ;</l>
     <l n="650">His silver beard , that swept his aged breast ,</l>
     <l n="651">His piercing eye , that inward light express 'd ,</l>
     <l n="652">Were seen ,— but clouds and darkness veil 'd the rest .</l>
     <l n="653">Fear chill 'd my heart : to one of mortal race ,</l>
     <l n="654">How awful seem 'd the Genius of the place !</l>
     <l n="655">So in Cimmerian shores , Ulysses saw</l>
     <l n="656">His parent-shade , and shrunk in pious awe ;</l>
     <l n="657">Like him I stood , and wrapt in thought profound ,</l>
     <l n="658">When from the pitying power broke forth a solemn sound : -</l>
     <l n="659">“ Care lives with all ; no rules , no precepts save</l>
     <l n="660">The wise from woe , no fortitude the brave ;</l>
     <l n="661">Grief is to man as certain as the grave :</l>
     <l n="662">Tempests and storms in life 's whole progress rise ,</l>
     <l n="663">And hope shines dimly through o'erclouded skies .</l>
     <l n="664">Some drops of comfort on the favour 'd fall ,</l>
     <l n="665">But showers of sorrow are the lot of ALL :</l>
     <l n="666">Partial to talents , then , shall Heav'n withdraw</l>
     <l n="667">Th ’ afflicting rod , or break the general law ?</l>
     <l n="668">Shall he who soars , inspired by loftier views ,</l>
     <l n="669">Life 's little cares and little pains refuse ?</l>
     <l n="670">Shall he not rather feel a double share</l>
     <l n="671">Of mortal woe , when doubly arm 'd to bear ?</l>
     <l n="672">“ Hard is his fate who builds his peace of mind</l>
     <l n="673">On the precarious mercy of mankind ;</l>
     <l n="674">Who hopes for wild and visionary things ,</l>
     <l n="675">And mounts o'er unknown seas with vent'rous wings ;</l>
     <l n="676">But as , of various evils that befall</l>
     <l n="677">The human race , some portion goes to all ;</l>
     <l n="678">To him perhaps the milder lot 's assigned</l>
     <l n="679">Who feels his consolation in his mind ,</l>
     <l n="680">And , lock 'd within his bosom , bears about</l>
     <l n="681">A mental charm for every care without .</l>
     <l n="682">E'en in the pangs of each domestic grief ,</l>
     <l n="683">Or health or vigorous hope affords relief ;</l>
     <l n="684">And every wound the tortured bosom feels ,</l>
     <l n="685">Or virtue bears , or some preserver heals ;</l>
     <l n="686">Some generous friend of ample power possess 'd ;</l>
     <l n="687">Some feeling heart , that bleeds for the distress 'd ;</l>
     <l n="688">Some breast that glows with virtues all divine ;</l>
     <l n="689">Some noble RUTLAND , misery 's friend and thine .</l>
     <l n="690">“ Nor say , the Muse 's song , the Poet 's pen ,</l>
     <l n="691">Merit the scorn they meet from little men .</l>
     <l n="692">With cautious freedom if the numbers flow ,</l>
     <l n="693">Not wildly high , nor pitifully low ;</l>
     <l n="694">If vice alone their honest aims oppose ,</l>
     <l n="695">Why so ashamed their friends , so loud their foes ?</l>
     <l n="696">Happy for men in every age and clime ,</l>
     <l n="697">If all the sons of vision dealt in rhyme .</l>
     <l n="698">Go on , then , Son of Vision ! still pursue</l>
     <l n="699">Thy airy dreams ; the world is dreaming too .</l>
     <l n="700">Ambition 's lofty views , the pomp of state ,</l>
     <l n="701">The pride of wealth , the splendour of the great ,</l>
     <l n="702">Stripp 'd of their mask , their cares and troubles known ,</l>
     <l n="703">Are visions far less happy than thy own :</l>
     <l n="704">Go on ! and , while the sons of care complain ,</l>
     <l n="705">Be wisely gay and innocently vain ;</l>
     <l n="706">While serious souls are by their fears undone ,</l>
     <l n="707">Blow sportive bladders in the beamy sun ,</l>
     <l n="708">And call them worlds ! and bid the greatest show</l>
     <l n="709">More radiant colours in their worlds below :</l>
     <l n="710">Then , as they break , the slaves of care reprove ,</l>
     <l n="711">And tell them , Such are all the toys they love . ”</l>
