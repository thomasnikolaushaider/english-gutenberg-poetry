    <head>WORDSWORTH 'S POETICAL WORKS</head>
     <l n="1">1814</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The Excursion — to which the fifth volume of this edition is devoted — has been assigned to the year 1814 ; since it was finished , and first published , in that year ,— although commenced in 1795 . During the earlier stages of its composition , this poem was known , in the Wordsworth household , as “ The Pedlar ” ; and Dorothy Wordsworth tells us in one of her letters to the Beaumonts , preserved amongst the Coleorton MSS ., that “ The Pedlar ” was finished at Christmas 1804 . See also the Memoirs of Wordsworth , by his nephew ( vol . i. p. 304 , etc . ) , and Dorothy 's Grasmere Journal , passim . But The Excursion , as we have it now , was finished for press in 1814 . The poems more immediately belonging to that year are Laodamia , the Memorials of a Tour in Scotland , Dion , and two Sonnets .— ED .</p>
   <p>LAODAMIA</p>
   <p>Composed 1814 .— Published 1815 .</p>
   <note>Written at Rydal Mount . The incident of the trees growing and withering put the subject into my thoughts , and I wrote with the hope of giving it a loftier tone than , so far as I know , has been given to it by any of the Ancients who have treated of it . It cost me more trouble than almost anything of equal length I have ever written .— I. F .</note>
   <p>In 1815 and 1820 this poem was one of those “ founded on the Affections ” ; afterwards it was classed among the “ Poems of the Imagination . ” — ED .</p>

   <p>After meeting the Wordsworths at Charles Lamb 's , on the 9th May 1815 , Henry Crabb Robinson wrote in his Diary : “ It is the mere power which he is conscious of exerting in which he delights , not the production of a work in which men rejoice on account of the sympathies and sensibilities it excites in them . Hence , he does not much esteem his Laodamia , as it belongs to the inferior class of poems founded on the affections . ” ( See Diary , Reminiscences , and Correspondence , vol . i. p . 482 . )</p>
   <p>Wordsworth wrote thus to Walter Savage Landor , from Rydal Mount , on the 21st of January 1824 :—</p>
   <p>“ You have condescended to minute criticism upon the Laodamia . [ D ] I concur with you in the first stanza , and had several times attempted to alter it upon your grounds . I cannot , however , accede to your objection to the ‘ second birth , ’ merely because the expression has been degraded by Conventiclers . [ E ] I certainly meant nothing more by it than the eadem cura , and the largior æther , etc ., of Virgil 's Sixth Æneid . All religions owe their origin or acceptation to the wish of the human heart to supply in another state of existence the deficiencies of this , and to carry still nearer to perfection what we admire in our present condition , so that there must be many modes of expression arising out of this coincidence , or rather identity of feeling common to all Mythologies ; and under this observation I should shelter the phrase from your censure — but I may be wrong in the particular case , though certainly not in the general principle . This leads to a remark in your last — ‘ that you are disgusted with all books that treat of religion . ’ I am afraid it is a bad sign in me , that I have little relish for any other . Even in poetry it is the imaginative only , viz ., that which is conversant with or turns upon Infinity , that powerfully affects me . Perhaps I ought to explain : I mean to say that except in those passages , where things are lost in each other , and limits vanish , and aspirations are raised , I read with something too like indifference ; but all great Poets are in this view powerful Religionists . ”</p>
   <p>In 1815 Charles Lamb wrote to Wordsworth , “ Laodamia is a very original poem ; I mean original with reference to your own manner . You have nothing like it . I should have seen it in a strange place , and greatly admired it , but not suspected its derivation . ” ( The Letters of Charles Lamb , edited by Alfred Ainger , vol . i. p . 284 . )</p>
   <p>Mr. Hazlitt wrote of Laodamia : “ It breathes the pure spirit of the finest fragments of antiquity — the sweetness , the gravity , the strength , the beauty , and the languor of Death . Its glossy brilliancy arises from the perfection of the finishing , like that of careful sculpture , not from gaudy colouring — the texture of the thoughts has the smoothness and solidity of marble . It is a poem that might be read aloud in Elysium , and the spirits of departed heroes and sages would gather round to listen to it . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">I am indebted to the Headmaster of Fettes College , Edinburgh , the Rev .</l>
     <l n="2">W. A . Heard , for the following illustrative notes on Laodamia :—</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ This poem illustrates more completely than any other the sympathy of the poet with the spirit of antiquity in its purest and most exalted forms . The idea that underlies the poem is the same conception of ‘ pietas ’ which Virgil has embodied in the Æneid , and with which he has associated , especially in the sixth book , which Wordsworth in many passages recalls , great ethical and religious conceptions , derived in the main from the philosophy of Plato . ‘ Pietas ’ embraces all the duties of life that are based upon the affections — love of home and parents and children , love of the Gods of our Fathers , and a reverence for that great order of things in which man finds himself a part . The pious man believes in a destiny , or order transcending his own will : to exalt any passion , however innocent , above this , is a rebellion ; to intensify any passion , so as to disturb the appropriate calm of resignation , is to act irreverently against the gods . Lesser duties must give way to greater : love of wife must give way to love of country , and the sorrow of bereavement must not obscure the larger issues of life . Thus , not only did Laodamia 's yearning for the restoration of her husband to life show a failure to recognise the fixity of eternal laws , but her death was ‘ ὑπὲρ μόρον ’ and in reason 's spite ; it was , after all , self-will , and could not win the favour of heaven .</p>
   <p>Blending with this notion of ‘ pietas , ’ we find the Platonic repudiation of sensuous and material life . This life is only a discipline under imperfect conditions , and to be set free from the passion and fretfulness of existence is the choice and longing of the wise .</p>
   <p>The poem is thus notable , not so much for the assimilation of details , as for natural affinity to the spirituality of antiquity , of which Virgil is the purest exponent . Virgil 's seriousness , his tenderness , his conception of the inevitable , and yet moral , order of the world , his desire for purification , his sadness , and yet complete freedom from unmanliness , his love of nature and belief in the sympathy of nature with man — all these are points of contact between the ancient and modern poet .</p>

   <p>Offerings were made to the infernal deities in the interval between midnight and sunrise . See Virgil 's Æneid , vi . 242-258 . Sil . Ital ., xiii . 405 .</p>

   <p>To his nephew , John Wordsworth , the poet wrote in 1831 , explaining the alterations he had made in the last stanza of Laodamia : “ As at first written , the heroine was dismissed to happiness in Elysium . To what purpose then the mission of Protesilaus ? He exhorts her to moderate her passions ; the exhortation is fruitless , and no punishment follows . So it stood : at present she is placed among unhappy ghosts for disregard of the exhortation . Virgil also places her there , but compare the two passages , and give me your opinion . ” ( William Wordsworth , by Elizabeth Wordsworth , p . 131 . )</p>

   <p>MEMORIALS OF A TOUR IN SCOTLAND</p>
   <p>1814</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">On the 18th July 1814 , Wordsworth left Rydal , on a second visit to</l>
     <l n="2">Scotland , accompanied by his wife , and her sister , Sarah</l>
     <l n="3">Hutchinson .— ED .</l>
   </lg>
   <note>In this tour , my wife and her sister Sara were my companions . The account of the “ Brownie 's Cell ” and the Brownies was given me by a man we met with on the banks of Loch Lomond , a little above Tarbert , and in front of a huge mass of rock , by the side of which , we were told , preachings were often held in the open air . The place is quite a solitude , and the surrounding scenery very striking . How much is it to be regretted that , instead of writing such Poems as the Holy Fair and others , in which the religious observances of his country are treated with so much levity and too often with indecency , Burns had not employed his genius in describing religion under the serious and affecting aspects it must so frequently take .

   <p>The text of this poem was unaltered in the successive editions with a single exception , occurring in the first line . It was suggested by , and was a reminiscence of the tour in Scotland of 1814 ; but in 1803 Wordsworth visited the same spot alluded to in the Fenwick note , accompanied by his sister , who thus describes it : “ The most remarkable object we saw was a huge single stone , I believe three or four times the size of Bowder Stone . The top of it , which on one side was sloping like the roof of a house , was covered with heather .... The ferryman told us that a preaching was held there once in three months by a certain minister — I think of Arrochar — who engages , as a part of his office , to perform the service . The interesting feelings we had connected with the Highland Sabbath and Highland worship returned here with double force . The rock , though on one side a high perpendicular wall , in no place overhung so as to form a shelter , in no place could it be more than a screen from the elements . Why then had it been selected for such a purpose ? Was it merely from being a central situation and a conspicuous object ? Or did there belong to it some inheritance of superstition from old times ? It is impossible to look at the stone without asking , How came it hither ? Had then that obscurity and unaccountableness , that mystery of power which is about it , any influence over the first persons who resorted hither for worship ? Or have they now on those who continue to frequent it ? The lake is in front of the perpendicular wall , and behind , at some distance , and totally detached from it , is the continuation of the ridge of mountain which forms the Vale of Loch Lomond — a magnificent temple , of which this spot is a noble Sanctum Sanctorum . ” ( Recollections of a Tour made in Scotland , A. D. 1803 , pp . 225-6 . ) The late Rev . William Macintosh of Buchanan supplied me with the following information in reference to the Brownie 's Cell and the Pulpit Rock :— “ I have little doubt that the Brownie 's Cell is the name given by Wordsworth to a small vault , itself a ruin among the ruins of an old stronghold of the Macfarlanes in Eilan Vhow , an islet about three miles from the head of the Loch . The name of the islet is spelt in different ways ; sometimes as I have given it , sometimes Eilan Vow , or Eilan-a Vhu ; no one whom I consulted could tell me the right spelling . In the early part of this century , the vault was the headquarters of a pedlar of the name of Macfarlane . He may have been the Hermit ; and there is a story of his having been frightened by the sudden apparition of a negro , ( probably the first he had ever seen ) , who had been ordered by his master — an English officer — to swim across for that purpose : and it is said that he never again visited the cell .</p>
   <p>The Pulpit Rock , also called by a Gaelic name meaning the Bull Stone , is a very large boulder , or detached rock , which is likely to ‘ stand ’ as long as Ben Lomond . In the face of it , there is an artificial doorway and recess , which at one time the Parish Minister used to occupy as a Pulpit for occasional services . The audience sat on turf seats ranged round the foot of the Rock . The pulpit was reached by a few steps cut out , I suppose , in the Rock : but it has never been used for the last twenty years . The ‘ occasional ’ services are now held in a neighbouring schoolroom . ”</p>
   <p>Mr. Malcolm M'Farlane , a very intelligent sheep farmer in Buchanan parish , supplies the following additional information about the Cell and the Rock :— “ The ‘ Pulpit Rock ’ is a cell in the face of a large stone , blasted out with gunpowder . The proper appellation is , in Gaelic , ‘ Clach-nan-Tairbh , ’ literally translated the ‘ Stone of the Bulls . ’ It was formed about 50 or 60 years ago , the then minister of Arrochar , Mr. Proudfoot , had promised to preach in that part of his parish , on several occasions during the year , provided they would get up a place for his reception .... It was capable of containing three or four persons inside , was done up with wood work , an outer and inner door , with stone steps leading to the recess . They were not formed out of the rock , but other stones got up for the purpose , and turf seats laid out for the hearers , who were all exposed to the weather , except so far as they might be sheltered by the rock . The service has been discontinued at the rock for about twenty-five years , and is now held at a schoolhouse . The doors are gone , and no portion of the wood work remains . The cell is now used only as a nightly retreat for mendicants , tinkers , ” etc . Wordsworth 's reference , in the Fenwick note , to Burns 's Holy Fair induces me to quote what follows in Mr. M'Farlane ' s letter :— “ Open air preaching was then very general in the Highlands : the people came long distances , travelled over hills , even in inclement weather , to attend them . An individual who kept a small inn , on the loch side opposite Inversnaid , used regularly to attend the meetings with a supply of whisky ; but he remained behind the ‘ rock ’ till the services were over , when the people partook of his refreshments . Also , on the north side of Loch Katrine , the minister of Callander used to conduct services in the open air , on several occasions during the year , in that distant part of his parish . An old man , who lived near the Trossachs , whom I remember very well , regularly attended with a supply of whisky . Dr. Robertson , who was then minister , after concluding the sermon , had gone to an adjoining farm house . The people had indulged too freely , so that a fight commenced ( the same thing had happened on several occasions before ) . The Doctor had to leave his dinner in order to get them separated , and to put an end to the battle , but he never allowed any more whisky to be brought to the place afterwards .... These may be irrelevant matters , but they might illustrate a chapter in Lecky 's History of Morals , as there is more decorum now observed . Since writing the above , I have thought that if the pulpit-rock is mentioned in Miss Wordsworth 's Tour , Mr. M'Nicol , my informant , must have made a mistake in stating the time it was made , as about 50 or 60 years ago ; but it cannot have been much more than 80 years , as it is not very long since some of the people who were engaged in the operation died .</p>
   <p>“ Regarding the island near the head of Loch Lomond which is termed ‘ Eilan ( Island ) Vow ’ in Black 's Guide , and somewhat differently spelt in others , in the original Gaelic it is ‘ Eilan a Bhūth . ’ Būth is a Gaelic name for a shop , so that it is ‘ the island of the shop . ’ The English Vow has no connection whatever with the Gaelic , and is perfectly unintelligible . It is part of undoubted traditional history that the chiefs of the Clan M'Farlane , who owned a considerable portion of the adjoining lands , had their residence here . In these turbulent times islands were considered more secure , as surrounded with water . They kept a ‘ shop ’ in the island , from which they supplied the little wants of the surrounding population , so that it is perfectly clear how the Island derived its name . A good portion of the stronghold is still in good preservation . A part of the wall is about thirty feet high . It is a very old building . Mr. M'Nicol states that he had learned from his grandfather , by the tradition in the family , that it was erected between the eleventh and the twelfth century . The late Sir James Colquhoun , about twelve years ago , laid out some money for keeping the walls in preservation . At the bottom of the Fort , and below the level of the floor , is the ‘ Brownie 's Cell , ’ several steps leading down to it , and it is partly underground . It is about twelve feet wide , and sixteen feet long , with an arched roof , the mason work being still in good repair . There is some glimmering light emitted by two small apertures formed in the walls at each end . I have been unable to obtain any specific information what purpose it served in connection with the other building . Some said that it must have been a prison , and others a store for the shop . It might have been a prison at first , and afterwards , in more pacific times , used as a store .</p>
   <p>“ About the beginning of this century , the Island was occupied by a very eccentric individual , who led the life of a hermit , and took up his abode in this recess . He made frequent excursions out of it , but always returned to his Island-home before the end of the week . It was not then planted with wood , so that he cultivated a part of the ground , raised some crops , kept some poultry . He trained the poultry to fly on the approach of any stranger , so that they could not be got hold of , or taken away in his absence from the Island . He also kept a curious diary , in which local events , his own doings and opinions , were recorded in great detail , expressed in very quaint language . It was by the age of the moon , and not by the days of the month , that events were entered in the diary . He also cultivated astrology , and believed in the evil influence of some of the stars . He had a firm belief in ghosts ; but he never was so frightened as when the Black Man ( that is the negro ) , who he thought belonged to the invisible world , swam to the island . Of that adventure I have not been able to obtain a more detailed account , but his landing there very nearly put him out of his wits . The grandfather of the present Duke of Montrose had , on one occasion , visited the Island ; and , when landing , the Hermit addressed him , ‘ James Graham , the Duke of Montrose , you are welcome to come and see my Island . ’ ... ”</p>
   <p>There is no evidence that the ruin was once “ a consecrated Pile , ” as stated in the poem . Wordsworth had evidently heard of the Hermit 's writings , as mentioned by Mr. M'Farlane . See stanza vi ., “ guiding a pen unwearied . ”</p>
   <p>In the Diary , Reminiscences , and Correspondence of Henry Crabb Robinson , there is an entry , dated January 2 , 1820 :— “ Went to Lamb 's , where I found Mr. and Mrs. Wordsworth .... Not much was said about his ( W .' s ) new volume of Poems . He himself spoke of The Brownie 's Cell as his favourite ” ( vol . ii . p. 162 ) . In the following year Mr. Crabb Robinson himself visited Scotland , and wrote thus on the 16th September :— “ Being on the western side of Loch Lomond , opposite the Mill at Inversnaid , some women kindled a fire , the smoke of which was to be a signal for a ferryboat . No ferryman came ; and a feeble old man offering himself as a boatman , I intrusted myself to him . I asked the women who he was . They said , ‘ That 's old Andrew . ’ According to their account he lived a hermit 's life in a lone island on the lake ; the poor peasantry giving him meal , and what he wanted , and he picking up pence . On my asking him whether he would take me across the lake , he said , ‘ I wull , if you 'll gi'e me saxpence . ’ So I consented . But before I was half over I repented of my rashness , for I feared the oars would fall out of his hands . A breath of wind would have rendered half the voyage too much for him . There was some cunning mixed up with the fellow 's seeming imbecility , for when his strength was failing he rested , and entered into talk , manifestly to amuse me . He said he could see things before they happened . He saw the Radicals before they came , etc . He had picked up a few words of Spanish and German , which he uttered ridiculously , and laughed . But when I put troublesome questions he affected not to understand me ; and was quite astonished , as well as delighted , when I gave him two sixpences instead of the one he had bargained for . The simple-minded women , who affected to look down on him , seemed , however , to stand in awe of him , and no wonder . On my telling Wordsworth this history , he exclaimed , ‘ That 's my “ Brownie ! " ’ His Brownie 's Cell is by no means one of my favourite poems . My sight of old Andrew showed me the stuff out of which a poetical mind can weave such a web ” ( vol . ii . pp . 212 , 213 ) .</p>

   <p>“ The waterfall , by a loud roaring , warned us when we must expect it . We were first , however , conducted into a small apartment , where the Gardener desired us to look at a picture of Ossian , which , while he was telling the history of the young Artist who executed the work , disappeared , parting in the middle — flying asunder as by the touch of magic — and lo ! we are at the entrance of a splendid apartment , which was almost dizzy and alive with waterfalls , that tumbled in all directions ; the great cascade , opposite the window , which faced us , being reflected in innumerable mirrors upon the ceiling and against the walls . ” — Extract from the Journal of my Fellow-Traveller .

   <p>“ FROM THE DARK CHAMBERS OF DEJECTION FREED ”</p>
   <p>Composed 1814 .— Published 1815</p>
   <note>Composed in Edinburgh , during my Scotch tour with Mrs. Wordsworth and my sister , Miss Hutchinson , in the year 1814 . Poor Gillies never rose above that course of extravagance in which he was at that time living , and which soon reduced him to poverty and all its degrading shifts , mendicity being far from the worst . I grieve whenever I think of him , for he was far from being without genius , and had a generous heart , not always to be found in men given up to profusion . He was nephew of Lord Gillies , the Scotch judge , and also of the historian of Greece . He was cousin to Miss Margaret Gillies , who painted so many portraits with success in our house .— I.

   <p>I am indebted to Miss Margaret Gillies — the artist referred to in the Fenwick note — for information in reference to her cousin , the subject of this sonnet . Robert Pearce Gillies was a man of unquestionable talent , but eccentric and extravagant . He inherited a considerable fortune , some £ 1500 a year , from his father , which he lost . He was editor of the Foreign Quarterly Review , was very intimate with De Quincey , and knew Sir Walter Scott , Wordsworth , and Quillinan well . He translated several German poems and novels , of which Scott thought highly . He was the author of Memoirs of a Literary Veteran ( 1851 ) , in which ( vol . ii . pp . 137-173 ) there is a sketch of Wordsworth , and several letters from him . He was also an accomplished musician , playing the violin admirably . He lived near Hawthornden .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The expression “ faded ” or “ fading grove , ” which Wordsworth applies to</l>
     <l n="2">Roslin , may refer merely to the season of the year , viz . September .— ED .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>A sonnet written by Gillies , and addressed to Wordsworth , may be quoted in this note . It was transcribed by Mrs. Wordsworth into a copy of the 4to edition of The Excursion ( 1814 ) , which was presented by the Poet to his grandson .</p>

    <head>YARROW VISITED</head>
    <head>SEPTEMBER , 1814</head>
     <l n="1">Composed 1814 .— Published 1815</l>
   </lg>
   <note>As mentioned in my verses on the death of the Ettrick Shepherd , my first visit to Yarrow was in his company . We had lodged the night before at Traquair , where Hogg had joined us , and also Dr. Anderson , the Editor of the British Poets , who was on a visit at the Manse . Dr. A. walked with us till we came in view of the Vale of Yarrow , and , being advanced in life , he then turned back . The old man was passionately fond of poetry , though with not much of a discriminating judgment , as the Volumes he edited sufficiently shew . But I was much pleased to meet with him , and to acknowledge my obligation to his collection , which had been my brother John 's companion in more than one voyage to India , and which he gave me before his departure from Grasmere , never to return . Through these Volumes I became first familiar with Chaucer , and so little money had I then to spare for books , that , in all probability , but for this same work , I should have known little of Drayton , Daniel , and other distinguished poets of the Elizabethan age , and their immediate successors , till a much later period of my life . I am glad to record this , not from any importance of its own , but , as a tribute of gratitude to this simple-hearted old man , whom I never again had the pleasure of meeting . I seldom read or think of this poem without regretting that my dear Sister was not of the party , as she would have had so much delight in recalling the time , when , travelling together in Scotland , we declined going in search of this celebrated stream , not altogether , I will frankly confess , for the reasons assigned in the poem on the occasion .— I. F .</note>
   <p>In 1815 and 1820 this was one of the “ Poems of the Imagination . ” In 1827 it became one of the “ Memorials of a Tour in Scotland ” of 1814 .</p>

   <p>Compare Yarrow Unvisited , vol . ii . p. 411 ; also Yarrow Revisited , composed in 1831 ; and Principal Shairp 's Essay entitled “ The Three Yarrows , ” in his Aspects of Poetry . “ I meant to mention Yarrow Visited , with that stanza , ‘ But thou , that didst appear so fair ’ ; than which I think no lovelier stanza can be found in the wide world of poetry ;— yet the poem , on the whole , seems condemned to leave behind it a melancholy of imperfect satisfaction , as if you had wronged the feeling with which , in what preceded it , you had resolved never to visit it , and as if the Muse had determined , in the most delicate manner , to make you , and scarce make you , feel it . Else , it is far superior to the other , [ R ] which has but one exquisite verse in it , the last but one , or the last two : this is all fine , except perhaps that that of ‘ studious ease , and generous cares , ’ has a little tinge of the less romantic about it . ” Charles Lamb to Wordsworth , in 1815 .

   <p>from the Ode , the morning of the Day appointed for a General Thanksgiving , January 18 , 1816 , he gave to the former the date 1815 ; and it is possible that it was composed towards the close of that year . But it was originally published in 1816 as part of the Thanksgiving Ode ; and , although ( in conformity with the plan of adopting the Author 's latest view of his own text ) it is printed by itself ,— as finally approved by him ,— it is not placed in the year 1815 , but in 1816 . The chief reason for this is , that it is kindred in theme , structure , and tendency with the other Odes belonging to that year ; and it seems better — when there is a doubt as to the date — to bring together those poems that are kindred in character . It does not follow , however , that part of the Thanksgiving Ode itself may not have been written in 1815 . Wordsworth , writing to Southey in 1816 , said :— “ It is a poem composed , or supposed to be composed , on the morning of the thanksgiving . ” Those belonging to the year 1815 are , therefore , few in number .— ED .</p>

For having held the Scepter five years , hunting one day in the Forest of Calater , he chanc 'd to meet his deposed Brother , wandering in mean condition ; who had bin long in vain beyond the Seas , importuning Foren aides to his Restorement : and was now in a poor Habit , with only ten followers , privatly return 'd to find subsistence among his secret friends . At the unexpected sight of him , Elidure himself also then but thinly accompanied , runs to him with open Arms ; and after many dear and sincere welcomings , convaies him to the Citty Alclud ; there hides him in his own Bed-Chamber . Afterwards faining himself sick , summons all his Peers as about greatest affairs ; where admitting them one by one , as if his weakness endur 'd not the disturbance of more at once , causes them , willing or unwilling , once more to swear Allegiance to Archigallo . Whom after reconciliation made on all sides , he leads to York : and from his own Head , places the Crown on the Head of his Brother , who thenceforth , Vice itself dissolving in him , and forgetting her firmest hold with the admiration of a deed so Heroic , became a true converted man : rul 'd worthily 10 years ; dy 'd and was Buried in Caer-Leir . Thus was a Brother saved by a Brother , to whom love of a Crown , the thing that so often dazles , and vitiates mortal man , for which thousands of neerest blood have destroy 'd each other , was in respect of Brotherly dearness , a contemptible thing . ” ( Milton , History of England , book i . ) — ED . ]</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>This sonnet was first published in The Examiner ( March 31 , 1816 ) . It was composed in December 1815 . On November 27 , Haydon wrote to Wordsworth : “ I have benefited , and have been supported in the troubles of life by your poetry . I will bear want , pain , misery , and blindness , but I will never yield one step I have gained on the road I am determined to travel over . ” ( See his Correspondence and Table Talk , vol . ii . pp . 19 , 20 . ) To this Wordsworth replied in the following letter which is explanatory of the above sonnet , and of the two sonnets that follow it .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ RYDAL MOUNT , near AMBLESIDE ,</l>
     <l n="2">December 21st , 1815 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Now for the poems , which are sonnets : one composed the evening I received your letter ; the other the next day ; and the third the day following . I shall not transcribe them in the order in which they were written , but inversely .</p>
   <p>“ The last you will find was occasioned , I might say inspired , by your last letter , if there be any inspiration in it ; the second records a feeling excited in me by the object it describes in the month of October last ; and the first by a still earlier sensation , which the revolution of the year impressed me with last autumn . ”</p>
   <p>( Then follow the three sonnets transcribed in the following order —</p>
   <p>“ While not a leaf seems faded ; while the fields . ”</p>
   <p>“ How clear , how keen , how marvellously bright . ”</p>
   <p>“ High is our calling , Friend !— Creative Art . ” )</p>
   <p>“ With high respect , I am , my dear sir , most faithfully yours .</p>
   <p>“ WILLIAM WORDSWORTH . ”</p>
   <p>( See the Autobiography of B. R. Haydon , vol . i. chap . xvi . p . 325 . )</p>
   <p>Haydon replied to Wordsworth , December 29 ( see his Correspondence , vol . ii . pp . 20-23 ): “ I must say that I have felt melancholy ever since receiving your sonnets , as if I was elevated so exceedingly , with such a drunken humming in my brain , that my nature took refuge in quiet humbleness and gratitude to God . ”</p>
   <p>It will be observed that in his letter of December 21 , Wordsworth mentions the order in which these three sonnets were composed in three consecutive days . In his subsequent arrangement of the sonnets he altered this order , assigning “ While not a leaf seems faded ” to “ September , ” and “ How clear , how keen , ” to “ November 1 ” ( another instance of the inaccuracy of his dates ) . The detailed statement in this letter to Haydon must be trusted , however , in preference to the “ afterthought ” of the editions of 1820 and 1827 . It may not be superfluous to note the dates of the first publication of this trilogy of sonnets , all of which Wordsworth sent to The Examiner .</p>

   <p>This sonnet originally appeared in The Examiner , January 28 , 1816 . It is rare indeed , if ever , that the Langdale Pikes retain the first snows of November till spring ; although , as described in another poem , the cove on Helvellyn , in which Red Tarn lies — sheltered from the sun , and high up on the mountain — may</p>
   <p>Keep till June December 's snow .</p>

   <note>Suggested at Hackett , which is on the craggy ridge that rises between the two Langdales , and looks towards Windermere . The Cottage of Hackett was often visited by us , and at the time when this Sonnet was written , and long after , was occupied by the husband and wife described in The Excursion , where it is mentioned that she was in the habit of walking in the front of the dwelling with a light to guide her husband home at night . The same cottage is alluded to in the Epistle to Sir George Beaumont , as that from which the female peasant hailed us on our morning journey . The musician mentioned in the sonnet was the Rev . Samuel Tillbrook of Peter-house , Cambridge , who remodelled the Ivy Cottage at Rydal after he had purchased it .— I . F .</note>

   <p>The light of the “ Taper ” referred to shone from Allan Bank ; the “ black recess of mountains ” described the heights of Silver Howe , and Easdale , round to Helm Crag ; the “ lake below , ” which “ reflected it not ” ( because of the distance of Allan Bank from the side of the mere ) , was , of course , Grasmere . Wordsworth is looking at this “ lamp suddenly glaring through sepulchral damp , ” however , from the eastern side of the lake , perhaps from the neighbourhood of “ The Wishing Gate . ” I am indebted to the Rev . W. A. Harrison , Vicar of St. Anne 's , Lambeth , for the following note to this sonnet :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ In the Sonnet No . xxiv ., ‘ Poems of the Imagination , ’ [ i. e .</l>
     <l n="2">‘ Miscellaneous Sonnets ’ ] these lines occur :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">Even as a dragon 's eye that feels the stress</l>
     <l n="4">Of a bedimming sleep , or as a lamp</l>
     <l n="5">Suddenly glaring through sepulchral damp ,</l>
     <l n="6">So burns yon Taper ‘ mid a black recess</l>
     <l n="7">Of mountains , silent , dreary , motionless :</l>
     <l n="8">etc . etc . etc .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ In line 3 , all the later editions read ‘ Suddenly glaring . ’ But why ‘ suddenly ’ ? There is nothing in the imagery of the poem which is at all suggestive of suddenness or unexpectedness in the appearance of the burning taper . The idea is alien from the spirit of the context . The dragon is drowsy and overborne with sleep . The taper is ‘ dreary ’ and ‘ motionless . ’ Everything is suggestive of ‘ sluggish stillness , ’ not of rapid , flashing movement .</p>
   <p>“ Yet I find the reading ‘ suddenly ’ in the one vol . ed . of 1828 , which is said to be a reprint of the edition of 1827 in 5 vols . ; in that of 1836-7 ; in that of 1840 ; and in all the later editions .</p>
   <p>“ In the edition of 1815 , however , the reading given is one that is in strict keeping with the rest of the imagery , namely —</p>
   <p>‘ Sullenly glaring . ’</p>
   <p>“ Is it likely that ‘ sullenly ’ was deliberately altered by Wordsworth to ‘ suddenly , ’ or is ‘ suddenly ’ a misprint that has been perpetuated through successive editions ?</p>
   <p>“ The sonnet in question is not dated , but it was probably written after 1807 and before 1815 .</p>
   <p>“ Now , in a well-known and often-quoted passage in Wordsworth 's letter in answer to Mathetes ( Friend , vol . iii . 35 , etc . ) , he speaks of the ‘ sullen light ’ which survives the extinguished flame of the candle that the schoolboy has blown out . ‘ It continues , ’ he says , ‘ to shine with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery ; it protracts its existence so long ... that the observer who had lain down in his bed so easy-minded , becomes sad and melancholy , ’ etc . etc . etc .</p>
   <p>“ In the sonnet the same ideas occur , only the ‘ melancholy ’ is here predicated figuratively of the ‘ light ’ itself :—</p>

   <p>“ MARK THE CONCENTRED HAZELS THAT ENCLOSE ”</p>
   <p>Published 1815</p>
   <note>Suggested in the wild hazel wood at the foot of Helm-crag , where the stone still lies , with others of like form and character , though much of the wood that veiled it from the glare of day has been felled . This beautiful ground was lately purchased by our friend Mrs. Fletcher ; the ancient owners , most respected persons , being obliged to part with it in consequence of the imprudence of a son . It is gratifying to mention that , instead of murmuring and repining at this change of fortune , they offered their services to Mrs. Fletcher , the husband as an outdoor labourer , and the wife as a domestic servant . I have witnessed the pride and pleasure with which the man worked at improvements of the ground round the house . Indeed he expressed those feelings to me himself , and the countenance and manner of his wife always denoted feelings of the same character . I believe a similar disposition to contentment under change of fortune is common among the class to which these good people belong . Yet , in proof that to part with their patrimony is most painful to them , I may refer to those stanzas entitled Repentance , no inconsiderable part of which was taken verbatim from the language of the speaker herself .— I .

   <p>Most of the poems belonging to 1816 were suggested by the stirring political events of that year on the Continent of Europe . Four odes , and a number of sonnets ,— referring to the Fall of Napoleon , the French army in Russia , the battle of Waterloo , etc .,— a translation of part of Virgil 's Æneid , and one or two smaller fragments , make up the series . Wordsworth had not been so much inspired by the political events of his time , since the years 1809 and 1810 — when he wrote the Tyrolese Sonnets , and others , “ Dedicated to Liberty , ” etc .— but , both before and during the year 1816 , he spent some time in preparing his eldest son for the University . He read the Latin poets with him ; and very probably it was this that led him to translate into English verse , the three first books of the Æneid , which he did at this time . Some fragments of his Translations will be found in the Appendix to vol . viii .— ED .</p>

   <note>The first stanza of this Ode was composed almost extempore , in front of Rydal Mount , before church-time , and on such a morning and precisely with such objects before my eyes as are here described . The view taken of Napoleon 's character and proceedings is little in accordance with that taken by some historians and critical philosophers . I am glad and proud of the difference , and trust that this series of poems , infinitely below the subject as they are , will survive to counteract , in unsophisticated minds , the pernicious and degrading tendency of those views and doctrines that lead to the idolatry of power , as power , and , in that false splendour , to lose sight of its real nature and constitution as it often acts for the gratification of its possessor without reference to a beneficial end — an infirmity that has characterised men of all ages , classes , and employments , since Nimrod became a mighty hunter before the Lord .— I . F .</note>
   <p>“ It is not to bespeak favour or indulgence , but to guard against misapprehension , that the author presumes to state that the present publication owes its existence to a patriotism , anxious to exert itself in commemorating that course of action , by which Great Britain has , for some time past , distinguished herself above all other countries .</p>
   <p>“ Wholly unworthy of touching upon so momentous a subject would that Poet be , before whose eyes the present distresses under which this kingdom labours , could interpose a veil sufficiently thick to hide , or even to obscure , the splendour of this great moral triumph . If the author has given way to exultation , unchecked by these distresses , it might be sufficient to protect him from a charge of insensibility , should he state his own belief that these sufferings will be transitory . On the wisdom of a very large majority of the British nation , rested that generosity which poured out the treasures of this country for the deliverance of Europe : and in the same national wisdom , presiding in time of peace over an energy not inferior to that which has been displayed in war , they confide , who encourage a firm hope , that the cup of our wealth will be gradually replenished . There will , doubtless , be no few ready to indulge in regrets and repinings ; and to feed a morbid satisfaction , by aggravating these burthens in imagination , in order that calamity so confidently prophesied , as it has not taken the shape which their sagacity allotted to it , may appear as grievous as possible under another . But the body of the nation will not quarrel with the gain , because it might have been purchased at a less price : and acknowledging in these sufferings , which they feel to have been in a great degree unavoidable , a consecration of their noble efforts , they will vigorously apply themselves to remedy the evil .</p>
   <p>“ Nor is it at the expense of rational patriotism , or in disregard of sound philosophy , that the author hath given vent to feelings tending to encourage a martial spirit in the bosoms of his countrymen , at a time when there is a general outcry against the prevalence of these dispositions . The British army , both by its skill and valour in the field , and by the discipline which has rendered it much less formidable than the armies of other powers , to the inhabitants of the several countries where its operations were carried on , has performed services for humanity too important and too obvious to allow any one to recommend , that the language of gratitude and admiration be suppressed , or restrained ( whatever be the temper of the public mind ) , through a scrupulous dread , lest the tribute due to the past , should prove an injurious incentive for the future . Every man , deserving the name of Briton , adds his voice to the chorus which extols the exploits of his countrymen , with a consciousness , at times overpowering the effort , that they transcend all praise . But this particular sentiment , thus irresistibly excited , is not sufficient . The nation would err grievously , if she suffered the abuse which other states have made of military power , to prevent her from perceiving that no people ever was , or can be , independent , free , or secure , much less great , in any sane application of the word , without martial propensities , and an assiduous cultivation of military virtues [ AO ] . Nor let it be overlooked , that the benefits derivable from these sources , are placed within the reach of Great Britain , under conditions peculiarly favourable . The same insular position which , by rendering territorial incorporation impossible , utterly precludes the desire of conquest under the most seductive shape it can assume , enables her to rely , for her defence against foreign foes , chiefly upon a species of armed force from which her own liberties have nothing to fear . Such are the blessed privileges of her situation ; and , by permitting , they invite her to give way to the courageous instincts of human nature , and to strengthen and to refine them by culture .</p>
   <p>“ But some have more than insinuated , that a design exists to subvert the civil character of the English people by unconstitutional applications and unnecessary increase of military power . The advisers and abettors of such a design , were it possible that it should exist , would be guilty of the most heinous crime , which , upon this planet , can be committed . The author , trusting that this apprehension arises from the delusive influences of an honourable jealousy , hopes that the martial qualities , which he venerates , will be fostered by adhering to those good old usages which experience has sanctioned ; and by availing ourselves of new means of indisputable promise ; particularly by applying , in its utmost possible extent , that system of tuition , of which the master-spring is a habit of gradually enlightened subordination ; by imparting knowledge , civil , moral , and religious , in such measure that the mind , among all classes of the community , may love , admire , and be prepared and accomplished to defend that country , under whose protection its faculties have been unfolded , and its riches acquired ; by just dealing towards all orders of the state , so that no members of it being trampled upon , courage may everywhere continue to rest immoveably upon its ancient English foundation , personal self-respect ; by adequate rewards , and permanent honours , conferred upon the deserving ; by encouraging athletic exercises and manly sports among the peasantry of the country ; and by especial care to provide and support sufficient institutions , in which , during a time of peace , a reasonable proportion of the youth of the country may be instructed in military science .</p>
   <p>“ Bent upon instant savings , a member of the House of Commons lately recommended that the Military College should be suppressed as an unnecessary expense ; for , said he , ‘ our best officers have been formed in the field . ’ More unwise advice has rarely been given ! Admirable officers , indeed , have been formed in the field , but at how deplorable an expense of the lives of their surrounding brethren in arms , a history of the military operations in Spain , and particularly of the sieges , composed with thorough knowledge , and published without reserve , would irresistibly demonstrate . [ AP ]</p>
   <p>“ The author has only to add that he should feel little satisfaction in giving to the world these limited attempts to celebrate the virtues of his country , if he did not encourage a hope that a subject , which it has fallen within his province to treat only in the mass , will by other poets be illustrated in that detail which its importance calls for , and which will allow opportunities to give the merited applause to PERSONS as well as to THINGS . ”</p>

   <p>Replying to some criticism on this Ode by Southey , Wordsworth wrote to his friend as follows :— “ I am much of your mind in respect to my Ode . Had it been a hymn , uttering the sentiments of a multitude , a stanza would have been indispensable . But though I have called it a ‘ Thanksgiving Ode , ’ strictly speaking it is not so , but a poem , composed , or supposed to be composed , on the morning of the thanksgiving , uttering the sentiments of an individual upon that occasion . It is a dramatised ejaculation ; and this , if anything can , must excuse the irregular frame of the metre . In respect to a stanza for a grand subject designed to be treated comprehensively , there are great objections . If the stanza be short , it will scarcely allow of fervour and importunity , unless so short , as that the sense is run perpetually from one stanza to another , as in Horace 's Alcaics ; and if it be long , it will be as apt to generate diffuseness as to check it . Of this we have innumerable instances in Spenser and the Italian poets . The sense required cannot be included in one given stanza , so that another whole stanza is added , not infrequently , for the sake of matter which would naturally include itself in a very few lines .</p>
   <p>“ If Gray 's plan be adopted , there is not time to become acquainted with the arrangement , and to recognise with pleasure the recurrence of the movement .</p>
   <p>“ Be so good as let me know where you found most difficulty in following me . The passage which I most suspect of being misunderstood is</p>
   <p>And thus is missed the sole true glory ;</p>
   <p>and the passage where I doubt most about the reasonableness of expecting that the reader should follow me in the luxuriance of the imagery and the language , is the one that describes , under so many metaphors , the spreading of the news of the Waterloo victory over the globe . ”</p>

   <p>The date of the composition of this Ode is uncertain . Wordsworth himself gives no clue : but it seems to refer to the rise of the French Republic , with its illusive promises of Liberty : the freedom of the many being sacrificed to the despotism of one . The Republic passed “ through many a change of form . ” It became both tyrannous and aggressive . The “ Principalities ” of Europe “ melted ” before it . It stood forth “ an armèd creature , ” and “ a terror to the Earth . ” It in turn put down “ Justice , ” “ Faith , ” and “ Hope ” throughout Europe ; and the writer of the Ode says ,</p>
   <p>How long shall vengeance sleep ? Ye patient Heavens , how long ?</p>
   <p>The allusions in stanza iv . suggest that this Ode was written before Waterloo , and the final overthrow of the power of Napoleon , but it is difficult , if not impossible , to determine the point with exactness from internal evidence .</p>
   <p>The reference in the last stanza may be to the legend of Amphion moving stones , and building up the walls of Thebes , by the sound of his lyre ; the stones advancing to their places , and being fitted together , as he played his instrument . Compare Tennyson 's Amphion .— ED .</p>

On the night of 6th November , the temperature suddenly fell to that of the most rigorous winter . In that dreadful night thousands of men perished , and nearly all the horses , which compelled the abandonment of the greater part of the convoys . From this point the road began to be strewn with corpses , presenting the aspect of one continuous battlefield ....

   <p>See Filicaia 's Canzone , addressed to ( Sir ) John Sobieski , king of Poland , upon his raising the siege of Vienna . This , and his other poems on the same occasion , are superior perhaps to any lyrical pieces that contemporary events have ever given birth to , those of the Hebrew Scriptures only excepted .— W . W. ( 1816 and 1820 . )</p>
   <p>Vienna , besieged in 1683 by Mahomet IV ., was relieved by John Sobieski . The following is Dyer 's account of it in his Modern Europe ( vol . iii . p. 109 ):— “ At one time Vienna seemed beyond the reach of human aid . The Turks sat down before it on 14th July , and such were their numbers that their encampment is said to have contained more than 100 , 000 tents . It was the middle of August before John Sobieski could leave Cracow with 25 , 000 men , and by the end of that month the situation of Vienna had become extremely critical . Provisions and ammunition began to fail ; the garrison had lost 6000 men , and numbers died every day by pestilence , or at the hands of the enemy . It was not till 9th September that Sobieski and his Poles formed a junction on the plain of Tuln with the Austrian forces under the Duke of Lorraine , and the other German contingents . On 11th September , the allies reached the heights of Kahlenberg , within sight of Vienna , and announced their arrival to the beleaguered citizens by means of rockets . On the following day the Turks were attacked , and , after a few hours ’ resistance , completely routed .... The Turkish camp , with vast treasures in money , jewels , horses , arms , and ammunition , became the spoil of the victors . ”</p>
   <p>The Italian poet Filicaia referred to by Wordsworth ( Filicaja , Vincenzo ) , wrote six odes on the deliverance of Vienna by Sobieski . They were published in Florence in the following year , 1684 , and established the writer 's fame . Queen Christina of Sweden was much struck by them ; and , being a generous patroness and admirer of letters , she enabled Filicaja to devote himself to poetry exclusively as his life-work . He wrote numerous patriotic sonnets and heroic odes , in Italian and in Latin .— ED . ]</p>

   <p>The Duc d'Enghien , grandson of the Prince de Condé , and only son of the Duc de Bourbon , born at Chantilly in 1772 , commanded the corps of Emigrés gathered on the Rhine by his grandfather . After the peace of Luneville , he retired to Ettenheim , near Strasburg , in German territory . There he married the Princess Charlotte of Rohan-Rochefort , and lived peacefully as a private citizen . He was , though wholly innocent , suspected by Napoleon of complicity in the plot of Pichegru , Cadoudal ( one of the Chouans ) , Moreau , and others , to overthrow him as first Consul , and to restore the Bourbon dynasty . “ The Duke was residing at Ettenheim , in the neutral territory of Baden , when Bonaparte , in violation of international law and the rights of the German Empire , caused him to be seized on the night of 15th March by a party of French gens d'armes , and to be carried to the castle of Vincennes , where , after a sort of mock trial , he was shot in the fosse of the fortress , March 21st ” ( 1804 ) .— Dyer 's Modern Europe ( vol . iv . p. 378 ) . The whole of the proceedings against the Duc d'Enghien were illegal ( as was confessed by the presiding judge ) , and his execution was one of the blackest stains on the character of Napoleon . After the Restoration , in 1814 , his remains were disinterred by order of Louis XVIII ., and buried in the chapel of the castle at Vincennes , where the restored king erected a monument to his memory . The “ pit of vilest mould ” mentioned in the sonnet , is , of course , the moat of the castle , and the phrase “ to lodge among ancestral kings , ” refers to Vincennes having been a royal residence , where many princes died and were buried , e. g . Queen Jeanne ( wife of Philippe le Bel ) , Louis le Hutin , and Charles le Bel . Vincennes is close to Paris , the fortress being only about five miles south-east of the Louvre . The chapel , which has a fine Gothic front , was begun in 1248 , and was finished in 1552 . The monument to the Duc d'Enghien is in the old Sacristy . It consists of four figures in marble , representing the Duke , supported by Religion and bewailed by France , while Vengeance waits behind . It was executed by Deseine .— ED .</p>

   <note>This poem was first introduced by a stanza that I have since transferred to the Notes , for reasons there given , [ BZ ] and I cannot comply with the request expressed by some of my friends that the rejected stanza should be restored .

    <p>This poem began with the following stanza , which has been displaced on account of its detaining the reader too long from the subject , and as rather precluding , than preparing for , the due effect of the allusion to the genius of Plato :—</p>
     <l n="1">Fair is the Swan , whose majesty , prevailing</l>
     <l n="2">O'er breezeless water , on Locarno 's lake ,</l>
     <l n="3">Bears him on while proudly sailing</l>
     <l n="4">He leaves behind a moon-illumined wake :</l>
     <l n="5">Behold ! the mantling spirit of reserve</l>
     <l n="6">Fashions his neck into a goodly curve ;</l>
     <l n="7">An arch thrown back between luxuriant wings</l>
     <l n="8">Of whitest garniture , like fir-tree boughs</l>
     <l n="9">To which , on some unruffled morning , clings</l>
     <l n="10">A flaky weight of winter 's purest snows !</l>
     <l n="11">— Behold !— as with a gushing impulse heaves</l>
     <l n="12">That downy prow , and softly cleaves</l>
     <l n="13">The mirror of the crystal flood ,</l>
     <l n="14">Vanish inverted hill ,<span corresp="#note174" type="note_anchor">[ 174 ]</span>and shadowy wood ,</l>
     <l n="15">And pendent rocks , where'er , in gliding state ,</l>
     <l n="16">Winds the mute Creature without visible Mate</l>
     <l n="17">Or Rival , save the Queen of night</l>
     <l n="18">Showering down a silver light ,</l>
     <l n="19">From heaven , upon her chosen favourite !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In the Fenwick note to An Evening Walk , vol . i. p. 5 , after describing the two pairs of swans that frequented the lake of Esthwaite , Wordsworth says : “ It was from the remembrance of those noble creatures , I took , thirty years after , the picture of the swan which I have discarded from the poem of Dion . ” After quoting the note , which explains the discarding of the above stanza , Professor Henry Reed remarks , “ It is a remarkable instance of the comparative sacrifice of a passage of great beauty to the poet 's dutiful regard for the principles of his Art ” ( American edition of 1851 , p. 415 ) . Wordsworth 's reasons for withdrawing the stanza are obvious ; but it is perhaps not unworthy of mention that when I was editing a volume of Selections from Wordsworth , to which many members of “ The Wordsworth Society ” contributed , Robert Browning besought me , in the strongest terms , to restore that discarded stanza .— ED . ]</p>

   <p>Some years ago I was inclined to assign this poem to the year 1814 , because Wordsworth himself gave it that date in one of the notes which he dictated to Miss Fenwick in 1843 . I now assign it to the year 1816 . Wordsworth gave it that date in the year 1837 , and if written in 1814 , I think it would have been included in the edition of 1815 .</p>
   <p>Dion , the Ode to Lycoris , and the translation of part of Virgil 's Æneid , belong to a time when Wordsworth had reverted to the subjects of ancient classical literature while preparing his eldest son for the University .</p>
   <p>Charles Lamb wrote thus to Dorothy Wordsworth in 1820 :— “ The story of Dion is divine — the genius of Plato falling on him like moonlight — the finest thing ever expressed . ” ( The Letters of Charles Lamb , edited by Alfred Ainger , vol . ii . p . 56 . )</p>
   <p>I am indebted to the Headmaster of Fettes College , the Rev . W. A . Heard , for the following notes on the poem , with special reference to Plutarch . They reveal , as Mr. Heard remarks , “ Wordsworth 's method of work upon the authors he had read and studied , and show upon what a solid structure of fact he always wrote . ” It will be observed that he invariably appended to the title of this poem “ ( See Plutarch ) . ”</p>
   <p>“ When Dion , the pupil of Plato , became the autocrat of Syracuse , it seemed as if the moment had come for the rule of a philosopher . But the gardens of the Academy knew nothing of the methods by which alone intrigue could be met and unscrupulousness baffled . The murder of Heracleides became a political necessity ; but when this was conceded , the charm was once and for ever broken — the career was done . Plutarch 's biography deals mainly with the external conditions , and is overlaid with so much historical detail that the personality of Dion stands out in insufficient relief . Wordsworth gives us a study of the internal struggle , showing us the failure of an ideal , not in its external aspect , but as closing the aspirations , and desolating the conscience , of a truly noble mind . He accepts Plutarch 's general conception of the life , incorporating much of the details and adopting some of the language , but over and above the fresh emphasis he gives to critical moments , the imaginative insight with which all the detail is treated makes the poem an original presentation .</p>
   <p>... a swan-like grace Of haughtiness without pretence .</p>
   <p>ὑψηλὸς τῷ ἤθει καὶ μεγαλόφρων .— ‘ He was lofty in his disposition and large-minded . ’ Again , Plutarch speaks of the “ σεμνότης ” — the ‘ still magnificence ’ of his nature , coupled with “ τὸ γενναῖον καὶ ἁπλότης , ” nobility and simplicity .</p>
   <p>Softening their inbred dignity austere .</p>
   <p>βουλομένου τοῦ Πλάτωνος ὁμιλίᾳ χάριν ἐχούσῃ καὶ παιδιᾶς ἐμμελοῦς κατὰ καιρὸν ἁπτομένῃ κεραννύμενον ἀφηδύνεσθαι τοῦ Δίωνος τὸ ἦθος . Plato tried to soften the harshness of his disposition by the delights of intercourse , and the grace of seasonable wit .</p>

   <p>Perhaps the idea of Ilissus bending over the urn is taken from the western pediment of the Parthenon .

   <p>Dion was anxious to give Syracuse a constitution , but he found Heracleides an incessant opponent in spite of the long forbearance he had shown him . Feeling that the one obstacle to a settlement must at all costs be removed , he yielded to advisers whom he had long withstood , and allowed them to put Heracleides to death . He gave him , however , a public funeral , and persuaded the people that it was impossible for the State to have peace on any other conditions .</p>
   <p>But whence that sudden check ?...</p>
   <p>ἐτύγχανε μὲν γὰρ ὀψὲ τῆς ἡμέρας καθεζόμενος ἐν παστάδι τῆς οἰκίας μόνος ὢν πρὸς ἑαυτῷ τὴν διάνοιαν · ἐξαίφνης δὲ ψόφου γενομένου πρὸς θατέρῳ πέρατι τῆς στοᾶς , ἀποβλέψας ἔτι φωτὸς ὄντος εἶδε γυναῖκα μεγάλην στολῇ μὲν καὶ προσώπῳ μηδὲν Ἐριννύος τραγικῆς παραλλάττουσαν , σαίρουσαν δὲ καλλύντρῳ τινὶ τὴν οἰκίαν .— He happened to be sitting late in the evening in a corridor of the house in solitary meditation : suddenly a sound was heard in the further end of the portico , and looking up , he saw in the lingering light the form of a majestic woman , in dress and face like the Fury as she appears in tragedy — sweeping the house with a brush .</p>
   <p>In Plutarch , the apparition is simply ominous of coming evil , his son , a few days afterwards , throwing himself in a fit of petulance from the roof of the palace , and his own death shortly following : the moral significance assigned to it in the poem is Wordsworth 's own interpretation .</p>
   <p>And , in their anguish , bear what other minds have borne !</p>
   <p>In Plutarch , Dion calls his attendants , dreading to be left alone for fear the spectre should return ( παντάπασιν ἐκστατικῶς ἔχων καὶ δεδοικὼς μὴ πάλιν εἰς ὄψιν αὐτῷ μονωθέν τὸ τέρας ἀφίκηται ) . Wordsworth seems to have taken a hint from this passage , and to have added a tragic intensity by representing the horror as one which he could share with no one , a supernatural doom in which he must be absolutely solitary .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Ill-fated Chief ! there are whose hopes are built</l>
     <l n="2">Upon the ruins of thy glorious name .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Callippus , an early friend of Dion 's in Athens , and bound to him by a sacred association as he had initiated him into the mysteries , was now in Syracuse , and for selfish ends was plotting his friend 's ruin , ἐλπίσας Σικελίαν ἆθλον ἕξειν τῆς ξενοκτονίας , ‘ hoping to get Sicily as the prize of his treachery . ’</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">O matchless perfidy ! portentous lust</l>
     <l n="2">Of monstrous crime !...</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Not only was this Callippus his friend , not only had he initiated him into the mysteries at Athens , a bond of peculiar sanctity , but there was even a worse perfidy : to allay the suspicions of Dion 's household he had taken ‘ the awful oath ’ . Descending into the sacred enclosure of Demeter , he had put on the purple robe of the goddess , and taking a burning torch in his hand , had disowned upon oath any thought of treachery . Yet in spite of this awful oath , he chose the very festival of the goddess as the moment for perpetrating the crime .</p>
   <p>... The marble city wept .</p>
   <p>Syracuse was one of the most magnificent cities of the ancient world , and contained a large number of splendid buildings built from the quarries adjacent to the city . Perhaps the most famous was the great theatre , the seats of which were formed with slabs of white marble .</p>
   <p>... too just To his own native greatness to desire That wretched boon , days lengthened by mistrust .</p>
   <p>ὁ μὲν Δίων , ὡς ἔοικεν , ἐπὶ τοῖς κατὰ τὸν Ἡρακλείδην ἀχθόμενος καὶ τὸν φόνον ἐκεῖνον ὥς τινα τοῦ βίου καὶ τῶν πράξεων αὐτῷ κηλῖδα περικειμένην , δυσχεραίνων ἀεὶ καὶ βαρυνόμενος εἶπεν ὅτι πολλάκις ἤδη θνήσκειν ἕτοιμός ἐστι καὶ παρέχειν τῷ βουλομένῳ σφάττειν αὑτόν , εἰ ζῆν δεήσει μὴ μόνον τοὺς ἐχθρούς , ἀλλὰ καὶ τοὺς φίλους φυλαττόμενον . His relations had been cautioning him against Callippus ; but ‘ Dion , grieved at heart , it would seem , at the fate of Heracleides , and ever chafing at and brooding over the murder as a stain upon his life and conduct , was willing , he said , to die a thousand deaths and yield his neck to any who would strike the blow , if life was only to be had by guarding against friends as well as foes . ’ ” — ED .</p>

   <p>Composed 1816 .— Published 1820</p>
   <note>The complaint in my eyes , which gave occasion to this address to my daughter , first showed itself as a consequence of inflammation , caught at the top of Kirkstone , when I was over-heated by having carried up the ascent my eldest son , a lusty infant . Frequently has the disease recurred since , leaving my eyes in a state which has often prevented my reading for months , and makes me at this day incapable of bearing without injury any strong light by day or night . My acquaintance with books has therefore been far short of my wishes ; and on this account , to acknowledge the services daily and hourly done me by my family and friends , this note is written .— I .

   <p>This Vernal Ode was first published in the volume entitled “ The River Duddon , a series of Sonnets : Vaudracour and Julia : and other poems . To which is annexed , a Topographical Description of the Country of the Lakes , in the north of England . ” In that volume its title was Ode .— 1817 . In 1820 it was placed among the “ Poems of the Imagination . ” Its title was merely Ode , and in the table of contents it was called “ Beneath the Concave ” ; the page heading “ Vernal Ode ” being given to it on the last three of its six pages . In 1827 , and 1832 , it was transferred to the “ Poems of Sentiment and Reflection . ” In 1836 it was returned to the class of “ Poems of the Imagination . ” — ED .</p>

    <head>MAY , 1817</head>
     <l n="1">Composed 1817 .— Published 1820</l>

   <note>The discerning reader — who is aware that in the poem of Ellen Irwin I was desirous of throwing the reader at once out of the old ballad , so as if possible , to preclude a comparison between that mode of dealing with the subject and the mode I meant to adopt — may here perhaps perceive that this poem originated in the four last lines of the first stanza . Those specks of snow , reflected in the lake and so transferred , as it were , to the subaqueous sky , reminded me of the swans which the fancy of the ancient classic poets yoked to the car of Venus . Hence the tenor of the whole first stanza , and the name of Lycoris , which — with some readers who think my theology and classical allusion too far fetched and therefore more or less unnatural and affected — will tend to unrealise the sentiment that pervades these verses . But surely one who has written so much in verse as I have done may be allowed to retrace his steps in the regions of fancy which delighted him in his boyhood , when he first became acquainted with the Greek and Roman poets . Before I read Virgil I was so strongly attached to Ovid , whose Metamorphoses I read at school , that I was quite in a passion whenever I found him , in books of criticism , placed below Virgil . As to Homer , I was never weary of travelling over the scenes through which he led me . Classical literature affected me by its own beauty . But the truths of Scripture having been entrusted to the dead languages , and these fountains having recently been laid open at the Reformation , an importance and a sanctity were at that period attached to classical literature that extended , as is obvious in Milton 's Lycidas for example , both to its spirit and form in a degree that can never be revived . No doubt the hacknied and lifeless use into which mythology fell towards the close of the 17th century , and which continued through the 18th , disgusted the general reader with all allusion to it in modern verse ; and though , in deference to this disgust , and also in a measure participating in it , I abstained in my earlier writings from all introduction of pagan fable , surely , even in its humble form , it may ally itself with real sentiment , as I can truly affirm it did in the present case .— I . F .</note>
   <p>One of the “ Poems of Sentiment and Reflection . ” In 1847 Wordsworth wrote to Mr. Fletcher that this poem was “ suggested to him one day at Ullswater , in the year 1817 , by seeing two white , snowy clouds reflected in the lake . ‘ They looked ’ ( he said ) , ‘ like two swans . ’ ” — ED .</p>

   <note>This , as well as the preceding and the two that follow , [ CR ] were composed in front of Rydal Mount , and during my walks in the neighbourhood . Nine-tenths of my verses have been murmured out in the open air : and here let me repeat what I believe has already appeared in print . One day a stranger having walked round the garden and grounds of Rydal Mount asked one of the female servants , who happened to be at the door , permission to see her master 's study . “ This , ” said she , leading him forward , “ is my master 's library where he keeps his books , but his study is out of doors . ” After a long absence from home it has more than once happened that some one of my cottage neighbours has said — “ Well , there he is ; we are glad to hear him booing about again . ” Once more in excuse for so much egotism let me say , these notes are written for my familiar friends , and at their earnest request . Another time a gentleman whom James had conducted through the grounds asked him what kind of plants throve best there : after a little consideration he answered — “ Laurels . ” “ That is , ” said the stranger , “ as it should be ; do n't you know that the laurel is the emblem of poetry , and that poets used on public occasions to be crowned with it ? ” James stared when the question was first put , but was doubtless much pleased with the information .— I.

   <p>The spot described in this sequel to Lycoris is , I think , the bower in the rock on Nab Scar , alluded to in Dorothy Wordsworth 's Grasmere Journal ( see note to The Waterfall and the Eglantine , vol . ii . p. 172 ) . The description in that Journal , taken in connection with the text of this poem , warrants the suggestion that the “ Friend ” with whom he had “ known such happy hours together ” was his own sister Dorothy . The extreme probability that it was on Nab Scar that the snow patches lay , which were reflected in Rydal mere , and which his imagination transformed into the swans that carried Venus ’ car through heaven , adds to the likelihood of this conjecture . The following extracts from the Sister 's journal may be compared with passages in the poem :— “ We pushed on to the foot of the Scar . It was very grand when we looked up , very stony .... Coleridge went to search for something new . We saw him climbing up towards a rock . He called us , and we found him in a bower ,— the sweetest that was ever seen . The rock on one side is very high , and all covered with ivy , which hung loosely about , and bore bunches of brown berries . ” With this compare —</p>

   <p>Doubtless Wordsworth drew on his imagination , “ making a truth and beauty of his own , ” in this , as in every other description of place , which has a local colouring in it ; but to connect “ the dim cave ” of the Ode to Lycoris with these conversations between Coleridge and the Wordsworths — mentioned in the Grasmere Journal of the latter , and hinted at in the closing passage of the Ode — is certainly permissible .— ED .</p>

   <p>Still fewer than those of 1817 are the poems composed in 1818 . They comprise The Pilgrim 's Dream , The five Inscriptions , supposed to be found in and near a Hermit 's Cell , and the stanzas Composed upon an Evening of extraordinary Splendour and Beauty , etc . They were all written at or near Rydal Mount ; and their local allusions are all Rydalian .</p>

    <head>THE PILGRIM 'S DREAM ;</head>
    <head>OR , THE STAR AND THE GLOW-WORM</head>
     <l n="1">Composed 1818 .— Published 1820</l>
   </lg>
   <note>I distinctly recollect the evening when these verses were suggested in 1818 . It was on the road between Rydal and Grasmere , where Glow-worms abound . [ DB ] A Star was shining above the ridge of Loughrigg Fell , just opposite . I remember a critic , in some review or other , crying out against this piece . “ What so monstrous , ” said he , “ as to make a star talk to a glow-worm ! ” Poor fellow ! we know from this sage observation what the “ primrose on the river 's brim ” was to him .— I .

   <note>Felt , and in a great measure composed , upon the little mount in front of our abode at Rydal . In concluding my notices of this class of poems , it may be as well to observe that among the “ Miscellaneous Sonnets ” are a few alluding to morning impressions , which might be read with mutual benefit , in connection with these “ Evening Voluntaries . ” See , for example , that one on Westminster Bridge , that composed on a May Morning , the one on the Song of the Thrush , and that beginning — “ While beams of orient light shoot wide and high . ” — I.

   <p>The phrase “ men of genius ” includes Haydon . The first part of this note of 1820 , being one on Peter Bell , referring to Haydon 's Bible picture of Christ 's Entry into Jerusalem . ( See note to Peter Bell , l . 979 . )</p>
   <p>The American painter was Mr. Washington Allston . Wordsworth sent him a MS. copy of the poem , transcribed “ in gratitude for the pleasure he had received from the sight of Mr. Allston 's pictures , in particular ‘ Jacob 's Dream , ’ ” and at the end of the MS. of his poem , Wordsworth wrote , “ The Author does not know how far he was indebted to Mr. Allston for part of the 3rd stanza . The multiplication of ridges in a mountainous country , as Mr. A. has probably observed , arises from two causes , sunny or watery vapour — the former is here meant . When does Mr. A. return to England ? ” In a letter on “ Wordsworth and Allston , ” in The Athenæum , Mr. J. Dykes Campbell refers to “ something in the picture having given definite form to observations of natural phenomena the significance of which the poet had not immediately noted . ” “ Wordsworth , ” he adds , “ was a close and untiring rather than a quick or keen observer , and his mind was at all times stored with a wealth of notes which sometimes had to wait long before they could either be worked out or worked in . Sometimes — as in this instance , perhaps — they were revivified by the suggestions of some kindred observer who happened to anticipate the poet in giving them form . ” — See The Athenæum , August 7 , 1894 .— ED . ]</p>

   <p>With the exception of The Haunted Tree , and the lines entitled September 1819 , all the poems composed during the year 1819 were sonnets . Four of the latter were published along with Peter Bell , in the first edition of that poem ; and other twelve , along with The Waggoner , which was first published in the same year . One of the twelve refers to the Old Hall of Donnerdale , and belongs to the series of Sonnets on the River Duddon , where it will be found ( No . XXVII . ) It was first published , along with those referring to Rydal , in the volume of 1819 , and probably detached from the rest of the series , because originally it had no particular reference to the Old Hall in the Duddon Valley ; but was ( as Wordsworth indicates in the third of the Fenwick notes to the Duddon ) “ taken from a tradition belonging to Rydal Hall , which once stood , as is believed , upon a rocky and woody hill on the right hand as you go from Rydal to Ambleside , and was deserted from the superstitious fear here described , and the present site fortunately chosen instead . ” — ED .</p>
   <p>THIS , AND THE TWO FOLLOWING , WERE SUGGESTED<span corresp="#note347" type="note_anchor">[ 347 ]</span>BY MR. W. WESTALL 'S VIEWS OF THE CAVES , [ DJ ] ETC ., IN YORKSHIRE</p>
   <p>This , and the two following sonnets , were first published in Blackwood 's Magazine , vol . iv ., January 1819 , p. 471 . They were reprinted in The Poetical Album , edited by Alaric Watts , in 1829 ( Second Series , vol . i. pp . 332 , 333 ) under the title ,</p>
   <p>“ The Caves of Yorkshire . ” The same volume of the Album contains ( p. 43 ) the sonnet beginning —</p>
   <p>Not Love , not War , nor the tumultuous swell .</p>
   <p>In the 1819 edition of Peter Bell , p. 84 , a note , prefatory to the four following sonnets , occurs to this effect : “ The following Sonnets having lately appeared in Periodical Publications are here reprinted . ” — ED .</p>

   <p>Malham Cove is a noble amphitheatre of perpendicular limestone rock , lying in regular strata , the height being 300 feet in the centre . The Aire issues from the rock at the base of the cliff , a considerable stream . Possibly Westall 's picture of Malham Cove suggested to Wordsworth the Giant 's Causeway in Ireland , and its legend . They have the same columnar appearance ; although the former is limestone , and the latter basalt .— ED .</p>

   <p>There are many legendary stories connected with the Yorkshire caves , particularly in the Giggleswick district ; but I have been unable to trace any legend about the “ local Deity ” of Gordale . There is nothing in the letterpress of Westall 's views , or in the “ addenda ” to West 's Guide to the Lakes in Cumberland , about these legends . The chasm is a very remarkable cleft in the limestone rock , near Malham . Gray 's description of Gordale , in his Journal ( 1796 ) , may be referred to .— ED .</p>

   <note>I could write a treatise of lamentation upon the changes brought about among the cottages of Westmoreland by the silence of the spinning-wheel . [ DR ] During long winter nights and wet days , the wheel upon which wool was spun gave employment to a great part of a family . The old man , however infirm , was able to card the wool , as he sate in a corner by the fire-side ; and often , when a boy , have I admired the cylinders of carded wool which were softly laid upon each other by his side . Two wheels were often at work on the same floor ; and others of the family , chiefly little children , were occupied in teasing and cleaning the wool to fit it for the hand of the carder . So that all , except the smallest infants , were contributing to mutual support . Such was the employment that prevailed in the pastoral vales . Where wool was not at hand , in the small rural towns , the wheel for spinning flax was almost in as constant use , if knitting was not preferred ; which latter occupation has the advantage ( in some cases disadvantage ) that , not being of necessity stationary , it allowed of gossiping about from house to house , which good housewives reckoned an idle thing .— I .

   <p>Socrates to Simmias .— “ Will you not allow that I have as much of the spirit of prophecy in me as the swans ? For they , when they perceive that they must die , having sung all their life long , do then sing more than ever , rejoicing in the thought that they are about to go away to the God , whose ministers they are . But men , because they are themselves afraid of death , slanderously affirm of the swans , that they sing a lament at the last , not considering that no bird sings when cold , or hungry , or in pain , not even the nightingale , nor the swallow , nor yet the hoopoe , which are said indeed to tune a lay of sorrow , although I do not believe this to be true of them any more than of the swans . But because they are sacred to Apollo , they have the gift of prophecy , and anticipate the good things of another world ; wherefore they sing and rejoice in that day more than ever they did before . And I too , believing myself to be the consecrated servant of the same God , and the fellow-servant of the swans , and thinking that I have received from my master gifts of prophecy which are not inferior to theirs , would not go out of life less merrily than the swans . ” Phædo , 85 ( Jowett 's translation , vol . i. p. 462 ) .— ED .</p>

   <p>Where this Haunted Tree stood in Rydal Park , or whether it is still standing , cannot be determined . There are several “ time-dismantled oaks ” in the Park , but none with a heather couch beneath them , so far as I know . I have , however , heard stories of this tree from old residenters . The “ Lady , ” the “ lovely wanderer of the trackless hills , ” may have been the poet 's daughter , Dora , to whom ( probably ) this poem was inscribed .— ED .</p>

<note>Footnote EH : I have been unable to find any allusion to Simonides in Virgil .

   <p>Since the above was written , the late Professor William Sellar wrote to me :— “ I do not find any special reference to Simonides in Virgil . Besides the passages you refer to in Horace , there are two or three lines in the Odes , which he has translated from Simonides , e. g .</p>

     <l n="2">Merces : ( Carmina III . ii . 25 )</l>
   </lg>
   <p>but I think Wordsworth 's reference is quite vague . It is quite appropriate so far , that it was only in the Augustan age that the Romans got back to the great sources of Greek poetry , and one cause of the superiority of Virgil and Horace to all their contemporaries was that they did this much more thoroughly than the others , and appreciated the purest and oldest of these sources . Horace 's special study was of course the whole range of Greek lyric poetry . He no doubt acknowledges his relation to Sappho and Alcæus more than to Simonides , but he recognises him as well as Pindar among the Masters of lyrical poetry . So far as one can judge by the fragments of Simonides ’ lyrical poetry , I should say that his characteristics were tenderness , piety , and purity ; and , in these respects , he has a strong affinity with Virgil , which may explain their association together by Wordsworth . The passage quoted by you is very interesting , as showing how Wordsworth — the most essentially modern and least conventional of poets — regarded Virgil and Horace , who have often been disparaged as types of conventionalism .... It would be very interesting to bring together the various passages in which Wordsworth draws from the sources of classical poetry . His reminiscences of Latin poetry seem to me to have a peculiar freshness , different from the more direct reproduction of Milton , Gray , etc . ” — ED . ]</p>
   <p>1820</p>
   <p>The following poems may be assigned to the year 1820 . The River Duddon , a series of Sonnets , the Ode To Enterprise , some of the Memorials of a Tour on the Continent , and a number of Miscellaneous Sonnets . Several of the Duddon Sonnets were composed in previous years , and one of them was published as early as 1807 ; but , as the volume containing the entire series was published in 1820 — and the dedication was written on Christmas Eve of that year — the whole has been assigned to 1820 . In localising the allusions in these sonnets , I have been greatly indebted to Mr. Herbert Rix , whose paper contributed to the “ Transactions of the Wordsworth Society ” was only the first of a Series of admirable studies of the Duddon . I have also been greatly indebted to Canon Rawnsley . Most of the “ Memorials ” of the Continental Tour were written during the journey ; and , although they were not finished till 1822 — the year of publication — I think their chronological place should be in the year 1820 . In connection with these poems , I have had the advantage of perusing the two singularly interesting Journals of the Tour , written by Mrs. Wordsworth , and by the poet 's sister Dorothy . Both of these were written , in the form of notes or “ memoranda , ” during the journey . Miss Wordsworth 's was expanded from these earlier jottings , two months after her return to Rydal Mount ; and added to , as late as December 1821 . In the case of each poem , illustrative extracts are given from these two Journals ; and it will be seen that they cast much light on the incidents which gave rise to the Memorial Verses , and the circumstances under which they were composed . The poet 's wish that these journals should be published , at least in part , is expressed in the Fenwick note , which precedes the sonnet beginning , “ What lovelier home could gentle Fancy choose ? ” p. 294 ; and Mrs. Wordsworth , in a letter to Mr. John Kenyon — dated 28th December 1821 — after referring to her husband 's being “ busily engaged upon subjects connected with our Continental Journey , ” says , “ Miss W. is going on with her Journal , which will be ready to go to press interspersed with her brother 's Poems I hope before your return . ” She adds , however , “ I do not say this seriously , but we sometimes jestingly talk of raising a fund by such means , for a second and a farther trip into Italy . ” The diary and correspondence of Henry Crabb Robinson is also of use in determining some points connected with this Continental Journey , in which he accompanied the Wordsworths .— ED .</p>

   <p>Now that all hearts are glad , all faces bright .</p>
   <p>On the 2nd of February 1820 Wordsworth wrote to the Earl of Lonsdale : “ I sincerely condole with you on the lamented death of our most gracious and venerable Sovereign .... The best consolation for us all lies in the reflection that George the Third will be ranked by posterity among the best and wisest kings that ever sat upon the throne of England . ” — ED .</p>

   <p>The reference ( in lines 6-8 ) is probably to his sister Dorothy . Wordsworth , his wife , and sister were at Oxford on the 30th of May 1820 ; and they went on immediately afterwards to London : for H. C. Robinson tells us that , on the 2nd of June , he met the Wordsworths at Charles Lamb 's .— ED .</p>

They instantly halted — not a gun was fired — not a voice heard : but they stood gazing on the river with those feelings which the events of the last 15 years at once called up .

   <p>The only reference which Dorothy Wordsworth makes to Hockheim in her Journal of the Tour on the Continent ( 1820 ) is as follows :— July 25th .— “ We had a magnificent prospect down the Rhine into the Reingaw , stretching towards Bingen . Hockheim is on the right bank , nearly opposite to Mayence . The broad hills are enlivened by hamlets , villas , villages , and churches . ”</p>
   <p>Prince Schwartzenberg , referred to in Wordsworth 's own note , was Generalissimo of the allied armies of Austria , Prussia , Bavaria , and Russia , who were victors in the battle of Leipsic in 1813 . The retreat of the French towards the Rhine after that battle was almost as disastrous to them as the retreat from Moscow in the previous winter . The incident described in the sonnet doubtless occurred during this retreat , when the French were driven across the Rhine in November 1813 .— ED . ]</p>

    <head>THE RIVER DUDDON</head>
    <head>A SERIES OF SONNETS</head>
     <l n="1">Composed 1820 .— Published 1820</l>
   </lg>
   <p>[ It is with the little river Duddon as it is with most other rivers , Ganges and Nile not excepted ,— many springs might claim the honour of being its head . In my own fancy I have fixed its rise near the noted Shire-stones placed at the meeting-point of the counties , Westmoreland , Cumberland , and Lancashire . They stand by the way side on the top of the Wrynose Pass , and it used to be reckoned a proud thing to say that , by touching them at the same time with feet and hands , one had been in the three counties at once . At what point of its course the stream takes the name of Duddon I do not know . I first became acquainted with the Duddon , as I have good reason to remember , in early boyhood . Upon the banks of the Derwent I had learnt to be very fond of angling . Fish abound in that large river ; not so in the small streams in the neighbourhood of Hawkshead ; and I fell into the common delusion that the farther from home the better sport would be had . Accordingly , one day I attached myself to a person living in the neighbourhood of Hawkshead , who was going to try his fortune as an angler near the source of the Duddon . We fished a great part of the day with very sorry success , the rain pouring torrents , and long before we got home I was worn out with fatigue ; and , if the good man had not carried me on his back , I must have lain down under the best shelter I could find . Little did I think then it would be my lot to celebrate , in a strain of love and admiration , the stream which for many years I never thought of without recollections of disappointment and distress .</p>
   <p>During my college vacation , and two or three years afterwards , before taking my Bachelor 's degree , I was several times resident in the house of a near relative who lived in the small town of Broughton . I passed many delightful hours upon the banks of this river , which becomes an estuary about a mile from that place . The remembrances of that period are the subject of the 21st sonnet . The subject of the 27th is in fact taken from a tradition belonging to Rydal Hall , which once stood , as is believed , upon a rocky and woody hill on the right hand as you go from Rydal to Ambleside , and was deserted from the superstitious fear here described , and the present site fortunately chosen instead . The present hall was erected by Sir Michael le Fleming , and it may be hoped that at some future time there will be an edifice more worthy of so beautiful a position . With regard to the 30th sonnet it is odd enough that this imagination was realised in the year 1840 when I made a tour through that district with my wife and daughter , Miss Fenwick and her niece , and Mr. and Mrs. Quillinan . Before our return from Seathwaite Chapel the party separated . Mrs. Wordsworth , while most of us went further up the stream , chose an opposite direction , having told us that we should overtake her on our way to Ulpha . But she was tempted out of the main road to ascend a rocky eminence near it , thinking it impossible we should pass without seeing her . This , however , unfortunately happened , and then ensued vexation and distress , especially to me , which I should be ashamed to have recorded , for I lost my temper entirely . Neither I nor those that were with me saw her again till we reached the Inn at Broughton , seven miles . This may perhaps in some degree excuse my irritability on the occasion , for I could not but think she had been much to blame . It appeared , however , on explanation that she had remained on the rock , calling out and waving her handkerchief as we were passing , in order that we also might ascend and enjoy a prospect which had much charmed her . “ But on we went , her signals proving vain . ” How then could she reach Broughton before us ? When we found she had not gone on before to Ulpha Kirk , Mr. Quillinan went back in one of the carriages in search of her . He met her on the road , took her up , and by a shorter way conveyed her to Broughton , where we were all re-united and spent a happy evening .</p>
   <p>I have many affecting remembrances connected with this stream . Those I forbear to mention ; especially things that occurred on its banks during the later part of that visit to the sea-side , of which the former part is detailed in my Epistle to Sir George Beaumont .— I . F .]</p>

   <p>The Rev . Canon Rawnsley has also studied the Duddon Valley with great care , and I place his comments beside those of Mr. Rix , both when they are supplementary , and when they differ from the conclusions come to by Mr . Rix .— ED .</p>
   <p>“ The Duddon rises on Wrynose Fell , near to the ‘ Three-Shire Stone , ’ where Westmoreland , Cumberland , and Lancashire meet , though which of the rills descending from the heights above Wrynose Gap and uniting to form the streamlet which flows along the pass , is to be regarded as the ultimate source , or which of them the poet may have followed , it would perhaps be difficult to say . More than one takes its rise in just such a spot as we find described in the second and third sonnets , where the ‘ lofty waste ’ is haunted by the Spirit of ‘ Desolation , ’ where the ‘ whistling blast ’ sweeps bleakly by , and where ‘ naked stones , ’ such as the poet chose for his seat , are scattered all around . James Thorne , in his Rambles by Rivers ( London , 1844 , p. 10 ) , has given a rough woodcut of the source of the Duddon . ” ( Herbert Rix . )</p>
   <p>“ I was fortunate in seeking the ‘ birth-place of a native stream ’ after a very heavy fall of rain , and I followed the left hand branch to a basin , from which in winter time a full stream must pass with force , to judge by the deep channel-bed of white and bleached stones which the water has carved out of the peat-moss for itself . There was the clear height , and from it was seen quite distinctly Brathay Vale , and a glimpse of Duddon Vale at Cockley Beck , and of Windermere Lake below Lowwood , and the bare Yorkshire hills far away to the east-south-east . ” ( H. D . Rawnsley . ) ]</p>

Or , more likely , the ‘ sinuous lapse ’ is that which lies below the spectator , as he stands at this point of vantage , and looks down into Wrynose Bottom .

These similes are accurately descriptive of the river so seen , especially towards evening when the western light is on the water .

   <p>“ Wordsworth would probably have in his mind most of the few cots and farms in the upper reaches of the Duddon Vale as he wrote his Sonnet v. Half-a-mile south , the ‘ craggy mound ’ of the castle-like rock would rear out of mid-valley impressively enough . The larches that now sway and whisper about Cockley Beck , or on the little mound to the east of it , would then only be tiny trees . The birches may have risen in ‘ silver colonnade , ’ but now a few ashes , a few poplars , a few alders are the only trees near . Still , for the most part , the term ‘ unfruitful solitudes ’ characterises the spot ; and as the traveller at Cockley Beck looks north and east , these solitudes become impressively solemn from the dark desolation of craggy fell-side and utter treelessness . ” ( H.

   <p>These two lines are in a great measure taken from The Beauties of Spring , a Juvenile Poem , by the Rev . Joseph Sympson , author of The Vision of Alfred , etc . He was a native of Cumberland , and was educated in the vale of Grasmere , and at Hawkshead school : his poems are little known , but they contain passages of splendid description ; and the versification of his Vision of Alfred is harmonious and animated . The present severe season ,<span corresp="#note438" type="note_anchor">[ 438 ]</span>with its amusements , reminds me of some lines which I will transcribe as a favourable specimen . In describing the motions of the Sylphs , that constitute the strange machinery of his Vision of Alfred , he uses the following illustrative simile :—</p>

   <p>“ Wordsworth , from his Sonnet VI ., would seem to have been describing the Duddon in April ; and though by some misnomer ‘ the little speedwell 's darling blue ’ has by him been called the ‘ trembling eyebright , ’ to-day in July 1884 — though the time of the singing of birds who ‘ warble to their paramours ’ is over and gone — one can see by Duddon-side these ‘ old remains of hawthorn bowers . ’</p>
   <p>But I shall never forget the beauty or the size of the golden feathery spikes of sweet-scented Gallium ( lady 's bed straw ) , or the wonderful odour of the self-heal , and the glory of the harebells , as I saw them carpeting the meadows near Cockley Beck , this July day , 1884 ; and , as I plucked the very faintly scented euphrasia ( or eyebright ) , I wondered much which were the spring-flowers Wordsworth had in his mind that by their breath invited no caress . Would it be the buttercup , the daisy , or which ? He must have had some definite flower — scentless , but not less beautiful — in his eye as he wrote Sonnet VI . ” ( H. D . Rawnsley . )]</p>

   <p>The alternative view is that by the ‘ dark dell ’ no particular spot is indicated but the whole of the upper valley of the Duddon , which is of a savage and forbidding aspect , and quite of a character to have inspired the sonnet . It is almost treeless , and the ground on either side of the stream is covered with bracken and loose blocks of slate , while the fells rise steeply on either hand , and are capped by naked crags .</p>
   <p>As to the epithet ‘ blue ’ ( line 10 ) , the cerulean colour of the Duddon is one of its most exquisite characteristics , and is due , as Wordsworth has himself [ FH ] explained , to the hue of the rocks and gravel seen through the ‘ perfectly pellucid ’ water . ” ( Herbert Rix . )</p>
   <p>“ This sonnet puzzles me from the use of the words dark dell . I could find nothing at all hereabout that could possibly be described so , until I looked back at the rain-black solitudes north of Cockley Beck , and imagined the poet using the word dark in the sense of mysterious , when I can imagine he would have been helped to this thought of hideous usages , and rites accursed , by the large Druid-like-looking boulders , and the mounds of burial , suggested by the moraine-heaps in the neighbourhood . But I think the ‘ blue Streamlet ’ must have been suggested by the light blue grey colour of the slate pebbles over which Duddon slides so easily here . ” ( H. D . Rawnsley . ) ]</p>

<note>Footnote FI : “ There are four sets of stepping-stones across the Duddon . The first set is between Cockley Beck and Birks Brig , opposite to a farmhouse called Dale Head ; the second set , called by the natives of the district the ‘ Fiddle Steps , ’ is in a deep hollow between Birks Brig and Seathwaite , at a point where the footpath to Eskdale crosses the Duddon ; the third is opposite Seathwaite , and the fourth just above Ulpha .</note>   <note xml:id="noteFI" place="bottom" n="FI">“ There are four sets of stepping-stones across the Duddon .

   <p>Of these , the second and fourth may , I think , be disregarded . The question lies between the first and third , which we will call respectively the upper and the lower stones .</p>
   <p>James Thorne has fixed upon the upper stones as those of Wordsworth 's two sonnets , and has given a picture of them . His woodcut is very rude , but is sufficiently defined by the number of the stones , the gate on the right , and the distant cottage on the left . Mrs. Lynn Linton , too , in her Lake Country ( London , 1864 , p. 251 ) , claims the honour for the same set , and has given ( p. 252 ) , a very pretty picture of them . Miss Martineau , on the contrary , in her Survey of the Lake District ,<span corresp="#note441" type="note_anchor">[ 441 ]</span>appears to regard the stones opposite Seathwaite as the stones ; and the Rev . F. A. Malleson , in his article on ‘ Wordsworth and the Duddon ,'[ 442 ] takes the same view . This is the view which local tradition favours , for any inhabitant of Seathwaite or Ulpha , if asked for ‘ Wordsworth 's Stones , ’ would at once direct the stranger to the lower stones .</p>
   <p>There is something to be said for each of these opinions . The upper stones fit in with the order of the sonnets , coming after the sonnet about Cockley Beck , and before the sonnets about the Faëry Chasm , Seathwaite Chapel , and Ulpha Kirk . Moreover , the emphasis of the earlier sonnets in general , and of the opening lines of Sonnet IX . in particular , is on the growth of the ‘ struggling rill ’ — a thought which would be rather out of place if it came later in the series .</p>
   <p>On the other hand the ‘ zone chosen for ornament , ’ and the ‘ studied symmetry ’ are more applicable to the lower than to the upper stones ; they are of a bluish tint , are set at equal distances , and form a slight curve down stream , looking to a fanciful eye as though they were bending with the current . They are now ( 1894 ) disused , having been abandoned , on account of the frequent floods , in favour of a foot-bridge recently erected a little higher up the stream ; and already the path to the stepping-stones is overgrown and nearly obliterated .</p>
   <p>If the sonnets are taken to refer to the lower stones ‘ yon high rock ’ would probably mean Wallabarrow ; if to the upper stones , they would doubtless mean Castle How , a solitary and noticeable rock . ” ( Herbert Rix . )</p>
   <p>“ One cannot but believe that Wordsworth , as he wrote Sonnets IX ., X ., had in his mind the third series of stepping-stones opposite Seathwaite , and under Wallabarrow Crag .</p>
   <p>None of the others are fitly described as</p>
   <p>a zone chosen for ornament .</p>
   <p>Is it not possible that the word ‘ struggling , ’ as applied to rill ,— when viewed in connection with the words ‘ without restraint , ’ in line 8 of Sonnet IX .— points with great definiteness to the localising of the Sonnet at these Seathwaite stones ?</p>
   <p>Certainly the stream as it has descended through the ‘ deep chasm ’ of Sonnet XV . between the Pen and Wallabarrow , is well described as having grown after a struggle into a brook of loud and stately march at this point . There are no likelier spots for the children to have put</p>
   <p>Their budding courage to the proof</p>
   <p>than here , for there are several houses and farms on the wayside , whose younger inmates would have come down to these stepping-stones , in order to get to the village school , that ‘ Wonderful Walker ’ kept with so much honour at Seathwaite in olden time . ” ( H. D . Rawnsley . )]</p>

<note>Footnote FJ : “ Adopting the view that Sonnets IX . and X. refer to the stepping-stones at Dale Head , the position of the ‘ Faëry Chasm , ’ which has often caused perplexity , becomes clear .

It is , I believe , the rocky gorge which is crossed by Birks Brig .</note>
   <p>The stream is here precipitated down a series of falls , and at the same time is forced into a much narrower channel than it has hitherto occupied . In its downward course it is thrust from side to side in a series of rebounds , the effect being that the flood is churned into a mass of foam , while the rocks between which it is driven are scooped and chiselled into the most fantastic shapes — basins and niches , caverns and arches , and pillars with an odd spiral twist . Anything of a more elfin character could hardly be conceived .</p>
   <p>The turbulence of the water as it descends towards the bridge is very well expressed in the charming little sketch given at page 245 of Mrs. Lynn Linton 's Lake Country , but the cleft itself is not there represented . Of that , or a part of it , an illustration has been given by Mr. Chattock in his etchings of the River Duddon published in 1884 by the Fine Art Society .</p>
   <p>Neither Mr. Chattock nor Mrs. Lynn Linton has , however , identified the spot with the ‘ Faëry Chasm . ’ Mr. Chattock associates it with Sonnet XX ., though the imagery of that sonnet must , as he himself confesses , have been ‘ inspired by some scene farther down the river , ’ while Mrs. Lynn Linton ( p. 251 ) finds the ‘ Faëry Chasm ’ at Gowdrel Crag . This latter view , which is , apparently , that adopted also by Canon Rawnsley , is a very possible alternative , and is favoured by the fact that the bed of the stream is at that point strewn with blocks of sky-blue stone . In that case Sonnets XI . and XII . refer to the same chasm . Mr. Goodwin in Through the Wordsworth Country , illustrates a note on the Faëry Chasm by a picture of the chasm at Wallabarrow , and of all the ‘ clefts ’ this best fits with the epithet ‘ sunless ’ ; but is it not too vast for fairy scenes ?</p>
   <p>I could not learn that any faëry tradition was associated with either place . ” ( Herbert Rix . )</p>
   <p>“ I cannot rest satisfied that the Faëry Chasm of Sonnet XI . is to be looked for at Birks Brig . No sky-blue stone , above water or below , can be pointed out —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">As a smooth stage on which the tiny elves</l>
     <l n="2">Could leave their foot-prints as they danced in secret revels .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But if the wanderer by Duddon Vale rejoins the road till it passes these same farm buildings further down the valley , will strike into the field , and , attracted by the roar of the stream , search for the locality set forth in Sonnet XII ., he will find in mid-stream a huge blue-grey boulder that may have suggested Sonnet XI . to the poet . ” ( H.

<note>Footnote FL : “ In determining the spot to which this sonnet belongs two conditions have to be satisfied . In the first place , Seathwaite must be seen from it ; and , in the second , there must be an open prospect of fields . Now , from Cockley Beck to Ulpha there is no single spot upon the road satisfying these two conditions . Unless the line of the river is entirely abandoned , and some point of view high up on the fells is taken , there is , I believe , only one station in all the valley which supplies them , and that is the summit of a rock called in maps and guide-books ‘ Pen Crag , ’ but which the dalesmen always call simply ‘ The Pen ’ ( not to be confounded with the mountain of that name lower down the valley on the west ) . There is an additional reason for regarding the Pen as the station whence Wordsworth viewed his ‘ open prospect , ’ namely , that the point from which the ascent of the crag is most conveniently made is identical with the point where the Duddon makes his second plunge into a rocky abyss , which plunge is signalised in the very next sonnet ( XIV . ) . Thus , at the very spot where the poet is enabled to gain a view of ‘ the haunts of men , ’ ‘ some awful Spirit ’ impels the torrent ‘ utterly to desert ’ those haunts , and to make a second plunge into the wilderness . An increased significance is thus given to each of the sonnets ( XIII . and XIV . ) by the juxtaposition of the localities which they describe .</note>   <note xml:id="noteFL" place="bottom" n="FL">“ In determining the spot to which this sonnet belongs two conditions have to be satisfied .

Now , from Cockley Beck to Ulpha there is no single spot upon the road satisfying these two conditions . Unless the line of the river is entirely abandoned , and some point of view high up on the fells is taken , there is , I believe , only one station in all the valley which supplies them , and that is the summit of a rock called in maps and guide-books ‘ Pen Crag , ’ but which the dalesmen always call simply ‘ The Pen ’ ( not to be confounded with the mountain of that name lower down the valley on the west ) . There is an additional reason for regarding the Pen as the station whence Wordsworth viewed his ‘ open prospect , ’ namely , that the point from which the ascent of the crag is most conveniently made is identical with the point where the Duddon makes his second plunge into a rocky abyss , which plunge is signalised in the very next sonnet ( XIV . ) . Thus , at the very spot where the poet is enabled to gain a view of ‘ the haunts of men , ’ ‘ some awful Spirit ’ impels the torrent ‘ utterly to desert ’ those haunts , and to make a second plunge into the wilderness . An increased significance is thus given to each of the sonnets ( XIII . and XIV . ) by the juxtaposition of the localities which they describe .</note>
   <p>I should explain , in connection with this , that the Pen stands in the centre of the valley , a prominent and inviting look-out , and that the easy slope , by which it is on one side ascended , rises from the high-road , so that anybody who cares for views at all — and Wordsworth above all people — would not think of passing by without climbing to such an obvious point of vantage .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>The ‘ spouting mill ’ ( line 3 ) is now a ruin . In Wordsworth 's time it was in full work . Later ( in the autumn of 1842 ) , when it was visited by James Thorne , the wheel was broken , the machinery decaying , and the roof partly fallen in . At the present time , wheel , machinery , and roof have totally disappeared , and there is nothing to indicate that it ever was a mill . It was only by inquiring of the older inhabitants that I learnt these ruined walls standing by the Beck represent that ‘ mill for spinning yarn , ’ of which Wordsworth says that it calls to mind ‘ the momentous changes wrought by such inventions in the frame of society . ’ The ruin stands on the Tarn Beck , a few yards below Seathwaite Chapel , and on the other side of the stream .</p>
   <p>The last three lines of the sonnet ,</p>
   <p>While the warm hearth exalts the mantling ale , etc .,</p>
   <p>are probably an allusion to the Inn which , in Wordsworth 's time , was to be found here . This is now a farmstead . It is called Newfield , and is just below Seathwaite Chapel . In Wordsworth 's day it was inn and farm combined .</p>
   <p>Mr. Malleson , in the article quoted above , appears ( p. 576 ) to regard the green slope ascending towards Seathwaite Tarn , which opens on the left about a mile before the traveller reaches Seathwaite Chapel , as the ‘ Open Prospect ’ ; but , though the fields here are certainly ‘ sprinkled o'er with dwellings , ’ the juxtaposition of the ‘ hamlet , ’ the ‘ barn and byre , ’ and the ‘ spouting mill ’ is wanting , and the allusion to the inn loses its point . ” ( Herbert Rix . )</p>
   <p>“ It may be of interest to know that still the Newfield farm ( in Wordsworth 's time farm and inn combined ) keeps up the well-deserved description of the poet . It is still ‘ a generous household . ’ When the yeoman , who was the last innkeeper and farmer combined , was on his death-bed , he enjoined those to whom Newfield passed to remember that ‘ though the license was to drop , and it was to become a private house , yet no stranger in the valley who requested a night 's lodging was ever to be refused , ’ and the generous household are proud to keep up the tradition of hospitality . ” ( H. D . Rawnsley . )]</p>

   <p>Mr. Chattock identifies the ‘ chasm ’ with that at Gowdrel , higher up the river — a view which , besides breaking the order of the sonnets , would seem to be excluded by Wordsworth 's note on Sonnets XVII . and XVIII ., wherein he expressly states that the scenery ‘ which gave occasion to the sonnets from the 14th to the 20th inclusive , ’ lies about Seathwaite . Mr. Chattock 's remark that ‘ the rocks are columnar in character , ’ so that the fall of a fragment readily gives rise to the appearance of an elongated ‘ niche , ’ is worthy of note . It would probably apply to either chasm . ” ( Herbert Rix . )</p>

   <p>“ I cannot quit this first link ( the finding of a piece of gold ) of the mountains of Encaramada without recalling to mind a fact that was not unknown to Father Gili , and which was often mentioned to me during our abode in the Missions of the Orinoco . The natives of those countries have retained the belief that , ‘ at the time of the great waters , when their fathers were forced to have recourse to boats to escape the general inundation , the waves of the sea beat against the rocks of Encaramada . ’ This belief is not confined to one nation singly , the Tamanacs ; it makes part of a system of historical tradition , of which we find scattered notions among the Maypures of the great cataracts , among the Indians of the Rio Erevato , which runs into the Caura , and among almost all the tribes of the Upper Orinoco . When the Tamanacs are asked how the human race survived this great Deluge , the ‘ age of water ’ of the Mexicans , they say , ‘ a man and a woman saved themselves on a high mountain , called Tamanacu , situated on the banks of the Asiveru , and casting behind them , over their heads , the fruits of the Mauritia palm-tree , they saw the seeds contained in those fruits produce men and women , who re-peopled the earth . ’ Thus we find in all its simplicity , among nations now in a savage state , a tradition which the Greeks embellished with all the charms of imagination ! A few leagues from Encaramada , a rock , called Tepu-mereme , or ‘ the painted rock , ’ rises in the midst of the Savannah . Upon it are traced representations of animals , and symbolic figures resembling those we saw in going down the Orinoco , at a small distance below Encaramada , near the town Caycara . Similar rocks in Africa are called by travellers fetish-stones . I shall not make use of this term , because fetishism does not prevail among the natives of the Orinoco ; and the figures of stars , of the sun , of tigers , and of crocodiles , which we found traced upon the rocks in spots now uninhabited , appeared to me in no way to denote the objects of worship of those nations . Between the banks of the Cassiquiare and the Orinoco , between Encaramada , the Capuchino , and Caycara , these hieroglyphic figures are often seen at great heights , on rocky cliffs which could be accessible only by constructing very lofty scaffolds . When the natives are asked how those figures could have been sculptured , they answer with a smile , as if relating a fact of which only a white man could be ignorant , that ‘ at the period of the great waters , their fathers went to that height in boats . ’ ” Extract from Humboldt 's Travels , vol . ii . chap . iv . pp . 182-3 ( Bohn 's Edition . ) — ED .</p>
   <p>“ The weathering of the volcanic ash of the Pen and the cliff of Wallabarrow opposite would naturally have suggested this sonnet . Evidence of ice-marking and glacier-action are not wanting in the neighbourhood . ” ( H. D . Rawnsley . )]</p>

   <p>Hall Dunnerdale , sometimes shortened into Dunnerdale , is a hamlet on the high-road between Seathwaite and Ulpha . From a bridge just below this hamlet the characteristics of the stream at this part of its course as described in Sonnet XX . may best be noted . The banks are thickly wooded with oak , ash , beech , alder , sycamore , and larch ; the hills are lower and greener than the fells farther up the valley , and for the moment we might almost think we had been transported to the banks of the Wey , and were looking upon a Surrey landscape . The water above and below the bridge is comparatively still . But this , as the sonnet says , is not to last long ,— ‘ a rough course remains , rough as the past . ’ Before we reach Ulpha Bridge ‘ suspended animation is again succeeded by the clamorous war of stones and waters , which assail the ear of the traveller all the way to Duddon Bridge .

   <p>[ Concerning the limits of Dunnerdale , the Rev . S. R. M. Walker , Vicar of Seathwaite , in answer to a question on the subject , wrote to Mr. Rix as follows :—</p>
   <p>“ SEATHWAITE VICARAGE , June 21 , 1883 .</p>
   <p>DEAR SIR — I am not surprised at our topographical divisions giving a stranger difficulty . They belong to the cross kind . Thus , Dunnerdale ( as it is now here usually spelled ) forms an integral part of the civil division , or township , of Dunnerdale and Seathwaite , whilst ecclesiastically it is attached , not to Seathwaite , but to the ecclesiastical parish or district of Broughton-in-Furness ; Seathwaite , Broughton-in-Furness , and Woodland ( now all separate benefices ) , being so many outlying parts of the ancient ecclesiastical and civil parish of Kirkby-Ireleth . Dunnerdale itself is the name given to the district which lies on the east or Lancashire bank of the Duddon , from a point a few yards south of Ulpha bridge till it meets the boundary of Broughton proper , or the right bank of the Lickle , a small tributary of the Duddon , the main portion of it being enclosed in a little valley parallel to that of the Duddon . The fells bounding it do , on the more northern part , form a line of division from Seathwaite ....</p>

   <p>The scene of the tragedy is not , however , very difficult to identify . There are very few ‘ hidden pools ’ in this part of the stream ; it is mostly a shallow , brawling brook . I have carefully tracked the stream from Donnerdale Bridge to Ulpha Bridge , and can only find two places which at all answer to the description given in the sonnet . One of these is opposite the ‘ Traveller 's Rest ’ inn , the other , is a little higher up . This latter is a deep and placid pool , situated half way down a curious corridor , known as ‘ Long Dub , ’ where the stream flows for some distance in a straight line between walls of rough mountain slate , the strata having been tilted almost at right angles to their natural position . Here a little rill tumbles into the Duddon by a miniature cascade , and the pool is sheltered and darkened by oak and beech — a not unlikely spot to have inspired the sonnet . ” ( Herbert Rix . )]</p>

   <p>“ Sonnets XXIV . to XXVII . appear to have been written in one spot ,— some ‘ Nook — with woodbine hung and straggling weed . ’ If the poet has strictly retained in the sonnets the order in which the places lie upon the river-bank , this nook must be within a stone 's throw of the pool mentioned in the preceding note , for the scenes of Sonnets XXIX . and XXXI . are close at hand . But , though there are plenty of such ‘ grottos ’ or ‘ arbours ’ here , some difficulty arises from the fact that the Old Hall and ruined keep cannot be seen from this part of the stream , nor , indeed , can they be seen from Ulpha itself , nor from any part of the high road . The height upon which the ruin stands is certainly a prominent feature in the landscape , but the ruin itself is completely hidden by a shoulder of the hill , neither can the hill by any stretch of the imagination be called a ‘ cliff . ’</p>
   <p>The only point of view from which the castle appears to stand upon a ‘ cliff ’ is reached by a footpath near some copper works , about half way up Holehouse Ghyll . Here you see the ruin at the end ( or rather bend ) of the Ghyll high above your head , the sides of the ravine rising steeply to its walls . Holehouse Ghyll is thickly wooded , so that this may very possibly be the poet 's ‘ dim retreat , ’ the chief objection being that the Ghyll lies below Ulpha Kirk , and that the order of the sonnets would thus be broken .</p>
   <p>But wherever the poet 's ‘ nook ’ may have been , there can be little doubt that the fragment of masonry near the farmhouse called ‘ The Old Hall , ’ represents the ‘ embattled house ’ of Sonnet XXVII ., for Broughton Tower , the only other fortified house in the valley , is still some miles away , and the rising ground upon which it stands is no cliff , but a mere undulation in the centre of the nether valley . Of the Castle at the head of Holehouse Ghyll there is little enough remaining — less , even , than in Wordsworth 's day , for a woman living in a cottage close by it assured me that she could remember when there was much more of it standing than at the present time . The cause to which she assigned its rapid disappearance was not , however , the same as that assigned in the first two lines of the sonnet . According to her , natural decay had less to do with it than the destructive hands of the dalesmen , who pulled the stones down to mend the fell-walls with . A native of Ulpha added that a new barn was built for the adjoining farmhouse some little time since , and that a great part of the materials doubtless came from the old ruin .</p>
   <p>A ragged piece of wall three to four feet in thickness , with three small square windows splayed inwards , and a fireplace about 6 feet long by 12 feet high , with a wide chimney , is all that now remains in situ , of this seat of the Lords of Ulpha .</p>

     <l n="1">As to the ghostly tradition embodied in Sonnet XXVII . Wordsworth himself</l>
     <l n="2">has explained ( see the Fenwick note ) that it was borrowed from Rydal</l>
     <l n="3">Hall . But the ‘ Old Hall ’ has a weird tradition of its own , for in the</l>
     <l n="4">bottom of the Ghyll beneath the Castle walls , there is a pool , called</l>
     <l n="5">‘ The Lady 's Dub , ’ where in old times a lady was killed by one of the</l>
     <l n="6">numerous wolves which formerly infested the region . This is , in fact ,</l>
     <l n="7">the origin , according to some of the inhabitants , of the name ‘ Ulpha ’</l>

   <p>The enclosure , known to the country people as the Sepulchre , is an old burial-place of the Society of Friends , none having been interred there since 1755 , when a Friend from Birker , a small hamlet about four miles distant , was buried .<span corresp="#note464" type="note_anchor">[ 464 ]</span></p>
   <p>The following two lines literally describe the condition of the little burial-ground :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Yet , to the loyal and the brave , who lie</l>
     <l n="2">In the blank earth , neglected and forlorn ;—</l>
   </lg>
   <p>the earth is ‘ blank , ’ because there is not a single tombstone , and the graves are ( at any rate at the present time ) most literally ‘ neglected and forlorn , ’ for the place is a tangle of rank grass and untrimmed bushes .</p>
   <p>About the year 1842 it was planted with fruit-trees , but when Wordsworth saw it , it probably presented much the same appearance as at present .</p>
   <p>The opening lines —</p>
   <p>No record tells of lance opposed to lance , etc .,</p>
   <p>and indeed the whole sonnet obtains a new significance from the association of the spot which it describes with the men of peace . ” ( Herbert Rix . )</p>
   <p>“ There are few more touching scenes in the Duddon Valley than the little lonely hillside burial-place of the early Friends , spoken of in Sonnet XXIX . All round the inside of the rude wall enclosure are still to be seen the stone seats used by the followers of Fox , who were forbidden to hold their meetings under any lower roof than the canopy of Heaven . The Scotch firs have grown into stately shade since the Quakers sat in silent meditation high up , lifted above the life of the valley and the noise of Duddon and the tributary stream just opposite . But though the Friends lie here in unvisited graves , the earth is neither blank nor forlorn . Laurels glisten above their rest , and the Spiræa salicifolia waves its light wands of flower above their sleep , all evidences of care for the heroes of a cause that is not dead yet . ” ( H. D . Rawnsley . )]</p>

   <p>When I visited Ulpha in the summer of 1882 I found the carpenters at work restoring it , and since then a new belfry has been erected , and the tiny white porch has been replaced by a larger one of wood . But I saw it in 1881 , when the interior , as well as the exterior , still kept the appearance which it wore in Wordsworth 's day . The pulpit ( with sounding-board ) was in the middle of one side , and to the right hand thereof were a magnificent lion-and-unicorn , and ‘ G. III . R . ’ The font was up against the wall , with a ladder hung above it . There was no vestry ; the surplice was kept in a cupboard near the door , and the clergyman donned and doffed it behind a screen which only partially hid him . The pews were square and high , and the people sat all round them , with their backs to all four points of the compass ; but when the hymn was sung they all turned with their backs to the altar and their faces to the choir . ” ( Herbert Rix . )</p>
   <p>“ The last line of this sonnet is a good instance of Wordsworth 's very close observation . The little churchyard has lately had an addition made to it . Any one going into the new part of the churchyard will be less able to understand the accuracy of the last line . ” ( H. D . Rawnsley . )]</p>

   <p>The allusion to the Greek poet will be obvious to the classical reader .— W . W. 1820 .</p>
   <p>I was indebted to Professor Jebb , in 1883 , for the following note :—</p>
   <p>“ While we , the brave , the mighty , and the wise , ... ... must vanish , ...</p>
   <p>has been suggested by the well-known lines in the Ἐπιτάφιον Βίωνος , by the pastoral poet Moschus of Syracuse ( circ . 200 B. C . ):—</p>
   <p>αἴ , αἴ , ταὶ μαλάχαι μὲν ἐπὰν κατὰ κᾶπον ὄλωνται , ἢ τὰ χλωρὰ σέλινα , τό τ ’ εὐθαλὲς οὖλον ἄνηθον , ὕστερον αὖ ζώοντι καὶ εἰς ἔτος ἄλλο φύοντι · ἄμμες δ ’ , οἱ μεγάλοι καὶ καρτεροὶ ἢ σοφοὶ ἄνδρες , ὁππότε πρᾶτα θάνωμες , ἀνάκοοι ἐν χθονὶ κοίλᾳ εὕδομες εὖ μάλα μακρὸν ἀτέρμονα νήγρετον ὕπνον . ]</p>
   <p>( Vv . 103-108 . )</p>
   <p>You will see that Wordsworth has translated the Greek verse which I underline ( ‘ brave ’ representing μεγάλοι ) . The ‘ mallows , ’ ‘ parsley , ’ ‘ anise ’ of the Greek poet 's garden — which are to live again — are represented by Wordsworth 's stream which ‘ shall for ever glide . ’</p>

     <l n="2">To breakfast , and keep festival to-day .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>No one believes , or is desired to believe , that these Poems were actually composed within such limits of time ; nor was there any reason why a prose statement should acquaint the Reader with the plain fact , to the disturbance of poetic credibility . But , in the present case , I am compelled to mention , that the above series of Sonnets was the growth of many years ;— the one which stands the 14th was the first produced ; and others were added upon occasional visits to the Stream , or as recollections of the scenes upon its banks awakened a wish to describe them . In this manner I had proceeded insensibly , without perceiving that I was trespassing upon ground preoccupied , at least as far as intention went , by Mr. Coleridge ; who , more than twenty years ago , used to speak of writing a rural Poem , to be entitled “ The Brook , ” of which he has given a sketch in a recent publication . But a particular subject , cannot , I think , much interfere with a general one ; and I have been further kept from encroaching upon any right Mr. C. may still wish to exercise , by the restriction which the frame of the Sonnet imposed upon me , narrowing unavoidably the range of thought , and precluding , though not without its advantages , many graces to which a freer movement of verse would naturally have led .</p>
   <p>May I not venture , then , to hope , that instead of being a hindrance , by anticipation of any part of the subject , these Sonnets may remind Mr. Coleridge of his own more comprehensive design , and induce him to fulfil it ? [ GO ] —— There is a sympathy in streams ,— “ one calleth to another ” ; and , I would gladly believe , that “ The Brook ” will , ere long , murmur in concert with “ The Duddon . ” But , asking pardon for this fancy , I need not scruple to say , that those verses must indeed be ill-fated which can enter upon such pleasant walks of nature , without receiving and giving inspiration . The power of waters over the minds of Poets has been acknowledged from the earliest ages ;— through the “ Flumina amem sylvasque inglorius ” of Virgil , [ GP ] down to the sublime apostrophe to the great rivers of the earth , by Armstrong , [ GQ ] and the simple ejaculation of Burns , [ GR ] ( chosen , if I recollect right , by Mr. Coleridge , as a motto for his embryo “ Brook ” ) ,</p>

    <head>As an illustration of the extraordinary freaks of contemporary criticism — freaks which still tarnish much that issues from the press — an estimate of those Duddon Sonnets , which appeared in The Monthly Review in 1820 , may be referred to . All that posterity now admires in this exquisite series of descriptive poems is decried ; and those passages which posterity regards as blemishes , are held up to admiration ; e. g . the lines with which the tenth sonnet , in “ The Stepping-Stones , ” concludes , which are so frigid and affected , were hailed as “ a complete return into the regions of antiquity , ” and as a sign that “ Mr. Wordsworth is certainly improving ” ! They are the very feeble lines :—</head>

   <p>NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII</p>
   <p>The EAGLE requires a large domain for its support ; but several pairs , not many years ago , were constantly resident in this country , building their nests in the steeps of Borrowdale , Wastdale , Ennerdale , and on the eastern side of Helvellyn . Often have I heard anglers speak of the grandeur of their appearance , as they hovered over Red Tarn , in one of the coves of this mountain . The bird frequently returns , but is always destroyed . Not long since one visited Rydal Lake , and remained some hours near its banks ; the consternation which it occasioned among the different species of fowl , particularly the herons , was expressed by loud screams . The horse also is naturally afraid of the eagle .— There were several Roman stations among these mountains ; the most considerable seems to have been in a meadow at the head of Windermere , established , undoubtedly , as a check over the passes of Kirkstone , Dunmail-raise , and of Hardknot and Wrynose . On the margin of Rydal Lake , a coin of Trajan was discovered very lately .— The ROMAN FORT here alluded to , called by the country people “ Hardknot Castle , ” is most impressively situated half-way down the hill on the right of the road that descends from Hardknot into Eskdale . It has escaped the notice of most antiquarians , and is but slightly mentioned by Lysons .— The DRUIDICAL CIRCLE is about half a mile to the left of the road ascending Stone-side from the vale of Duddon : the country people call it “ Sunken Church . ”</p>
   <p>The reader who may have been interested in the foregoing Sonnets ( which together may be considered as a Poem ) will not be displeased to find in this place a prose account of the Duddon , extracted from Green 's comprehensive Guide to the Lakes , lately published . “ The road leading from Coniston to Broughton is over high ground , and commands a view of the river Duddon ; which at high water is a grand sight , having the beautiful and fertile lands of Lancashire and Cumberland stretching each way from its margin . In this extensive view , the face of nature is displayed in a wonderful variety of hill and dale ; wooded grounds and buildings ; amongst the latter , Broughton Tower , seated on the crown of a hill , rising elegantly from the valley , is an object of extraordinary interest . Fertility on each side is gradually diminished , and lost in the superior heights of Blackcomb , in Cumberland , and the high lands between Kirkby and Ulverstone .</p>
   <p>“ The road from Broughton to Seathwaite is on the banks of the Duddon , and on its Lancashire side it is of various elevations . The river is an amusing companion , one while brawling and tumbling over rocky precipices , until the agitated water becomes again calm by arriving at a smoother and less precipitous bed , but its course is soon again ruffled , and the current thrown into every variety of form which the rocky channel of a river can give to water . ” ( Vide Green 's Guide to the Lakes , vol . i. pp . 98-100 . )</p>
   <p>After all , the traveller would be most gratified who should approach this beautiful Stream , neither at its source , as is done in the Sonnets , nor from its termination ; but from Coniston over Walna Scar ; first descending into a little circular valley , a collateral compartment of the long winding vale through which flows the Duddon . This recess , towards the close of September , when the after-grass of the meadows is still of a fresh green , with the leaves of many of the trees faded , but perhaps none fallen , is truly enchanting . At a point elevated enough to show the various objects in the valley , and not so high as to diminish their importance , the stranger will instinctively halt . On the foreground , a little below the most favourable station , a rude foot-bridge is thrown over the bed of the noisy brook , foaming by the wayside . Russet and craggy hills , of bold and varied outline , surround the level valley which is besprinkled with grey rocks plumed with birch trees . A few homesteads are interspersed in some places , peeping out from among the rocks like hermitages , whose site has been chosen for the benefit of sunshine as well as shelter ; in other instances , the dwelling-house , barn , and byre , compose together a cruciform structure , which , with its embowering trees and the ivy clothing part of the walls and roof , like a fleece , call to mind the remains of an ancient abbey . Time , in most cases , and nature every where , have given a sanctity to the humble works of man , that are scattered over this peaceful retirement . Hence a harmony of tone and colour , a consummation and perfection of beauty , which would have been marred had aim or purpose interfered with the course of convenience , utility , or necessity . This unvitiated region stands in no need of the veil of twilight to soften or disguise its features . As it glistens in the morning sunshine , it would fill the spectator 's heart with gladsomeness . Looking from our chosen station , he would feel an impatience to rove among its pathways , to be greeted by the milkmaid , to wander from house to house , exchanging “ good-morrows ” as he passed the open doors ; but , at evening , when the sun is set , and a pearly light gleams from the western quarter of the sky , with an answering light from the smooth surface of the meadows ; when the trees are dusky , but each kind still distinguishable ; when the cool air has condensed the blue smoke rising from the cottage-chimneys ; when the dark mossy stones seem to sleep in the bed of the foaming Brook ; then , he would be unwilling to move forward , not less from a reluctance to relinquish what he beholds , than from an apprehension of disturbing , by his approach , the quietness beneath him . Issuing from the plain of this valley , the Brook descends in a rapid torrent , passing by the churchyard of Seathwaite . The traveller is thus conducted at once into the midst of the wild and beautiful scenery which gave occasion to the Sonnets from the 14th to the 20th inclusive . From the point where the Seathwaite Brook joins the Duddon , is a view upwards , into the pass through which the River makes its way into the Plain of Donnerdale . The perpendicular rock on the right bears the ancient British name of THE PEN ; the one opposite is called WALLA-BARROW CRAG , a name that occurs in several places to designate rocks of the same character . The chaotic aspect of the scene is well marked by the expression of a stranger , who strolled out while dinner was preparing , and , at his return , being asked by his host , “ What way he had been wandering ? ” replied , “ As far as it is finished ! ”</p>
   <p>The bed of the Duddon is here strewn with large fragments of rock fallen from aloft ; which , as Mr. Green truly says , “ are happily adapted to the many-shaped waterfalls , ” ( or rather water-breaks , for none of them are high ,) “ displayed in the short space of half a mile . ” That there is some hazard in frequenting these desolate places , I myself have had proof ; for one night an immense mass of rock fell upon the very spot where , with a friend , I had lingered the day before . “ The concussion , ” says Mr. Green , speaking of the event , ( for he also , in the practice of his art , on that day sat exposed for a still longer time to the same peril ,) “ was heard , not without alarm , by the neighbouring shepherds . ” But to return to Seathwaite Churchyard : it contains the following inscription :—</p>
   <p>“ In memory of the Reverend Robert Walker , who died the 25th of June , 1802 , in the 93d year of his age , and 67th of his curacy at Seathwaite .</p>
   <p>“ Also , of Anne his wife , who died the 28th of January , in the 93d year of her age . ”</p>
   <p>In the parish-register of Seathwaite Chapel , is this notice :</p>
   <p>“ Buried , June 28th , the Rev . Robert Walker . He was curate of Seathwaite sixty-six years . He was a man singular for his temperance , industry , and integrity . ”</p>

    <head>MEMOIR OF THE REV . ROBERT WALKER</head>
    <head>In the year 1709 , Robert Walker was born at Under-crag , in Seathwaite ; he was the youngest of twelve children . His eldest brother , who inherited the small family estate , died at Under-crag , aged ninety-four , being twenty-four years older than the subject of this Memoir , who was born of the same mother . Robert was a sickly infant ; and , through his boyhood and youth continuing to be of delicate frame and tender health , it was deemed best , according to the country phrase , to breed him a scholar ; for it was not likely that he would be able to earn a livelihood by bodily labour . At that period few of these dales were furnished with school-houses ; the children being taught to read and write in the chapel ; and in the same consecrated building , where he officiated for so many years both as preacher and schoolmaster , he himself received the rudiments of his education . In his youth he became schoolmaster at Loweswater ; not being called upon , probably , in that situation , to teach more than reading , writing , and arithmetic . But , by the assistance of a “ Gentleman ” in the neighbourhood , he acquired , at leisure hours , a knowledge of the classics , and became qualified for taking holy orders . Upon his ordination , he had the offer of two curacies : the one , Torver , in the vale of Coniston ,— the other , Seathwaite , in his native vale . The value of each was the same , viz . five pounds per annum : but the cure of Seathwaite having a cottage attached to it , as he wished to marry , he chose it in preference . The young person on whom his affections were fixed , though in the condition of a domestic servant , had given promise , by her serious and modest deportment , and by her virtuous dispositions , that she was worthy to become the helpmate of a man entering upon a plan of life such as he had marked out for himself . By her frugality she had stored up a small sum of money , with which they began housekeeping . In 1735 or 1736 , he entered upon his curacy ; and nineteen years afterwards , his situation is thus described , in some letters to be found in the Annual Register for 1760 , from which the following is extracted :</head>

    <head>“ SIR ,</head>
    <head>“ I was the other day upon a party of pleasure , about five or six miles from this place , where I met with a very striking object , and of a nature not very common . Going into a clergyman 's house ( of whom I had frequently heard ) , I found him sitting at the head of a long square table , such as is commonly used in this country by the lower class of people , dressed in a coarse blue frock , trimmed with black horn buttons ; a checked shirt , a leathern strap about his neck for a stock , a coarse apron , and a pair of great wooden-soled shoes plated with iron to preserve them ( what we call clogs in these parts ) , with a child upon his knee , eating his breakfast ; his wife , and the remainder of his children , were some of them employed in waiting upon each other , the rest in teazing and spinning wool , at which trade he is a great proficient ; and moreover , when it is made ready for sale , will lay it , by sixteen or thirty-two pounds ’ weight , upon his back , and on foot , seven or eight miles , will carry it to the market , even in the depth of winter . I was not much surprised at all this , as you may possibly be , having heard a great deal of it related before . But I must confess myself astonished with the alacrity and the good humour that appeared both in the clergyman and his wife , and more so at the sense and ingenuity of the clergyman himself . ” ...</head>
     <l n="1">Then follows a letter from another person , dated 1755 , from which an</l>
     <l n="2">extract shall be given .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ By his frugality and good management , he keeps the wolf from the door , as we say ; and if he advances a little in the world , it is owing more to his own care , than to anything else he has to rely upon . I do n't find his inclination is running after further preferment . He is settled among the people , that are happy among themselves ; and lives in the greatest unanimity and friendship with them ; and , I believe , the minister and people are exceedingly satisfied with each other ; and indeed how should they be dissatisfied when they have a person of so much worth and probity for their pastor ? A man who , for his candour and meekness , his sober , chaste , and virtuous conversation , his soundness in principle and practice , is an ornament to his profession , and an honour to the country he is in ; and bear with me if I say , the plainness of his dress , the sanctity of his manners , the simplicity of his doctrine , and the vehemence of his expression , have a sort of resemblance to the pure practice of primitive Christianity . ”</p>
   <p>We will now give his own account of himself , to be found in the same place .</p>
   <p>From the Rev . ROBERT WALKER .</p>
   <p>“ SIR ,— Yours of the 26th instant was communicated to me by Mr. C ——, and I should have returned an immediate answer , but the hand of Providence , then laying [ GT ] heavy upon an amiable pledge of conjugal endearment , hath since taken from me a promising girl , which the disconsolate mother too pensively laments the loss of ; though we have yet eight living , all healthful , hopeful children , whose names and ages are as follows :— Zaccheus , aged almost eighteen years ; Elizabeth , sixteen years and ten months ; Mary , fifteen ; Moses , thirteen years and three months ; Sarah , ten years and three months ; Mabel , eight years and three months ; William Tyson , three years and eight months ; and Anne Esther , one year and three months ; besides Anne , who died two years and six months ago , and was then aged between nine and ten ; and Eleanor , who died the 23d inst ., January , aged six years and ten months . Zaccheus , the eldest child , is now learning the trade of a tanner , and has two years and a half of his apprenticeship to serve . The annual income of my chapel at present , as near as I can compute it , may amount to about £ 17 , of which is paid in cash , viz ., £ 5 from the bounty of Queen Anne , and £ 5 from W. P ., Esq ., of P ——, out of the annual rents , he being lord of the manor , and £ 3 from the several inhabitants of L ——, settled upon the tenements as a rent-charge ; the house and gardens I value at £ 4 yearly , and not worth more ; and I believe the surplice fees and voluntary contributions , one year with another , may be worth £ 3 ; but as the inhabitants are few in number , and the fees very low , this last-mentioned sum consists merely in freewill offerings .</p>
   <p>“ I am situated greatly to my satisfaction with regard to the conduct and behaviour of my auditory , who not only live in the happy ignorance of the follies and vices of the age , but in mutual peace and goodwill with one another , and are seemingly ( I hope really too ) sincere Christians , and sound members of the Established Church , not one dissenter of any denomination being amongst them all . I got to the value of £ 40 for my wife 's fortune , but had no real estate of my own , being the youngest son of twelve children , born of obscure parents ; and , though my income has been but small , and my family large , yet , by a providential blessing upon my own diligent endeavours , the kindness of friends , and a cheap country to live in , we have always had the necessaries of life . By what I have written ( which is a true and exact account to the best of my knowledge ,) I hope you will not think your favour to me , out of the late worthy Dr. Stratford 's effects , quite misbestowed , for which I must ever gratefully own myself , Sir , your much obliged and most obedient humble Servant ,</p>
   <p>“ R. W ., Curate of S ——,</p>
   <p>“ To Mr. C ., of Lancaster . ”</p>
   <p>About the time when this letter was written , the Bishop of Chester recommended the scheme of joining the curacy of Ulpha to the contiguous one of Seathwaite , and the nomination was offered to Mr. Walker ; but an unexpected difficulty arising , Mr. W ., in a letter to the Bishop , ( a copy of which , in his own beautiful handwriting , now lies before me ,) thus expresses himself . “ If he , ” meaning the person in whom the difficulty originated , “ had suggested any such objection before , I should utterly have declined any attempt to the curacy of Ulpha : indeed , I was always apprehensive it might be disagreeable to my auditory at Seathwaite , as they have been always accustomed to double duty , and the inhabitants of Ulpha despair of being able to support a schoolmaster who is not curate there also ; which suppressed all thoughts in me of serving them both . ” And in a second letter to the Bishop he writes :—</p>
   <p>“ MY LORD ,— I have the favour of yours of the 1st instant , and am exceedingly obliged on account of the Ulpha affair : if that curacy should lapse into your Lordship 's hands , I would beg leave rather to decline than embrace it ; for the chapels of Seathwaite and Ulpha , annexed together , would be apt to cause a general discontent among the inhabitants of both places ; by either thinking themselves slighted , being only served alternately , or neglected in the duty , or attributing it to covetousness in me ; all which occasions of murmuring I would willingly avoid . ” And in concluding his former letter , he expresses a similar sentiment upon the same occasion , “ desiring , if it be possible , however , as much as in me lieth , to live peaceably with all men . ”</p>
   <p>The year following , the curacy of Seathwaite was again augmented ; and , to effect this augmentation , fifty pounds had been advanced by himself ; and , in 1760 , lands were purchased with eight hundred pounds . Scanty as was his income , the frequent offer of much better benefices could not tempt Mr. W. to quit a situation where he had been so long happy , with a consciousness of being useful . Among his papers I find the following copy of a letter , dated 1775 , twenty years after his refusal of the curacy of Ulpha , which will show what exertions had been made for one of his sons .</p>
   <p>“ MAY IT PLEASE YOUR GRACE ,— Our remote situation here makes it difficult to get the necessary information for transacting business regularly ; such is the reason of my giving your Grace the present trouble .</p>
   <p>“ The bearer ( my son ) is desirous of offering himself candidate for deacon 's orders at your Grace 's ensuing ordination ; the first , on the 25th instant , so that his papers could not be transmitted in due time . As he is now fully at age , and I have afforded him education to the utmost of my ability , it would give me great satisfaction ( if your Grace would take him , and find him qualified ) to have him ordained . His constitution has been tender for some years ; he entered the college of Dublin , but his health would not permit him to continue there , or I would have supported him much longer . He has been with me at home above a year , in which time he has gained great strength of body , sufficient , I hope , to enable him for performing the function . Divine Providence , assisted by liberal benefactors , has blest my endeavours , from a small income , to rear a numerous family ; and as my time of life renders me now unfit for much future expectancy from this world , I should be glad to see my son settled in a promising way to acquire an honest livelihood for himself . His behaviour , so far in life , has been irreproachable ; and I hope he will not degenerate , in principles or practice , from the precepts and pattern of an indulgent parent . Your Grace 's favourable reception of this , from a distant corner of the diocese , and an obscure hand , will excite filial gratitude , and a due use shall be made of the obligation vouchsafed thereby to Your Grace 's very dutiful and most obedient Son and Servant ,</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>ROBERT WALKER . ”</head>
    <head>The same man , who was thus liberal in the education of his numerous family , was even munificent in his hospitality as a parish priest . Every Sunday , were served , upon the long table , at which he has been described sitting with a child upon his knee , messes of broth , for the refreshment of those of his congregation who came from a distance , and usually took their seats as parts of his own household . It seems scarcely possible that this custom could have commenced before the augmentation of his cure ; and what would to many have been a high price of self-denial , was paid , by the pastor and his family , for this gratification ; as the treat could only be provided by dressing at one time the whole , perhaps , of their weekly allowance of fresh animal food ; consequently , for a succession of days , the table was covered with cold victuals only . His generosity in old age may be still further illustrated by a little circumstance relating to an orphan grandson , then ten years of age , which I find in a copy of a letter to one of his sons ; he requests that half-a-guinea may be left for “ little Robert 's pocket-money , ” who was then at school : intrusting it to the care of a lady , who , as he says , “ may sometimes frustrate his squandering it away foolishly , ” and promising to send him an equal allowance annually for the same purpose . The conclusion of the same letter is so characteristic , that I cannot forbear to transcribe it . “ We , ” meaning his wife and himself , “ are in our wonted state of health , allowing for the hasty strides of old age knocking daily at our door , and threateningly telling us , we are not only mortal , but must expect ere long to take our leave of our ancient cottage , and lie down in our last dormitory . Pray pardon my neglect to answer yours ; let us hear sooner from you , to augment the mirth of the Christmas holidays . Wishing you all the pleasures of the approaching season , I am , dear Son , with lasting sincerity , yours affectionately ,</head>
     <l n="1">“ ROBERT WALKER . ”</l>

   <p>He loved old customs and usages , and in some instances stuck to them to his own loss ; for , having had a sum of money lodged in the hands of a neighbouring tradesman , when long course of time had raised the rate of interest , and more was offered , he refused to accept it ; an act not difficult to one , who , while he was drawing seventeen pounds a year from his curacy , declined , as we have seen , to add the profits of another small benefice to his own , lest he should be suspected of cupidity . From this vice he was utterly free ; he made no charge for teaching school ; such as could afford to pay , gave him what they pleased . When very young , having kept a diary of his expenses , however trifling , the large amount , at the end of the year , surprised him ; and from that time the rule of his life was to be economical , not avaricious . At his decease he left behind him no less a sum than £ 2000 ; and such a sense of his various excellencies was prevalent in the country , that the epithet of WONDERFUL is to this day attached to his name .</p>
   <p>There is in the above sketch something so extraordinary as to require further explanatory details .— And to begin with his industry ; eight hours in each day , during five days in the week , and half of Saturday , except when the labours of husbandry were urgent , he was occupied in teaching . His seat was within the rails of the altar ; the communion-table was his desk ; and , like Shenstone 's schoolmistress , the master employed himself at the spinning-wheel , while the children were repeating their lessons by his side . Every evening , after school hours , if not more profitably engaged , he continued the same kind of labour , exchanging , for the benefit of exercise , the small wheel , at which he had sate , for the large one on which wool is spun , the spinner stepping to and fro . Thus , was the wheel constantly in readiness to prevent the waste of a moment 's time . Nor was his industry with the pen , when occasion called for it , less eager . Intrusted with extensive management of public and private affairs , he acted , in his rustic neighbourhood , as scrivener , writing out petitions , deeds of conveyance , wills , covenants , etc ., with pecuniary gain to himself , and to the great benefit of his employers . These labours ( at all times considerable ) at one period of the year , viz ., between Christmas and Candlemas , when money transactions are settled in this country , were often so intense , that he passed great part of the night , and sometimes whole nights , at his desk . His garden also was tilled by his own hand ; he had a right of pasturage upon the mountains for a few sheep and a couple of cows , which required his attendance ; with this pastoral occupation , he joined the labours of husbandry upon a small scale , renting two or three acres in addition to his own less than one acre of glebe ; and the humblest drudgery which the cultivation of these fields required was performed by himself .</p>
   <p>He also assisted his neighbours in haymaking and shearing their flocks , and in the performance of this latter service he was eminently dexterous . They , in their turn , complimented him with the present of a haycock , or a fleece ; less as a recompense for this particular service than as a general acknowledgment . The Sabbath was in a strict sense kept holy ; the Sunday evenings being devoted to reading the Scripture and family prayer . The principal festivals appointed by the Church were also duly observed ; but through every other day in the week , through every week in the year he was incessantly occupied in work of hand or mind ; not allowing a moment for recreation , except upon a Saturday afternoon , when he indulged himself with a Newspaper , or sometimes with a Magazine . The frugality and temperance established in his house , were as admirable as the industry . Nothing to which the name of luxury could be given was there known ; in the latter part of his life , indeed , when tea had been brought into almost general use , it was provided for visitors , and for such of his own family as returned occasionally to his roof , and had been accustomed to this refreshment elsewhere ; but neither he nor his wife ever partook of it . The raiment worn by his family was comely and decent , but as simple as their diet ; the home-spun materials were made up into apparel by their own hands . At the time of the decease of this thrifty pair , their cottage contained a large store of webs of woollen and linen cloth , woven from thread of their own spinning . And it is remarkable that the pew in the chapel in which the family used to sit , remains neatly lined with woollen cloth spun by the pastor 's own hands . It is the only pew in the chapel so distinguished ; and I know of no other instance of his conformity to the delicate accommodations of modern times . The fuel of the house , like that of their neighbours , consisted of peat , procured from the mosses by their own labour . The lights by which , in the winter evenings , their work was performed , were of their own manufacture , such as still continue to be used in these cottages ; they are made of the pith of rushes dipped in any unctuous substance that the house affords . White candles , as tallow candles are here called , were reserved to honour the Christmas festivals , and were perhaps produced upon no other occasions . Once a month , during the proper season , a sheep was drawn from their small mountain flock , and killed for the use of the family ; and a cow , towards the close of the year , was salted and dried for winter provision : the hide was tanned to furnish them with shoes .— By these various resources , this venerable clergyman reared a numerous family , not only preserving them , as he affectingly says , “ from wanting the necessaries of life ” ; but affording them an unstinted education , and the means of raising themselves in society . In this they were eminently assisted by the effects of their father 's example , his precepts , and injunctions : he was aware that truth-speaking , as a moral virtue , is best secured by inculcating attention to accuracy of report even on trivial occasions ; and so rigid were the rules of honesty by which he endeavoured to bring up his family , that if one of them had chanced to find in the lanes or fields anything of the least use or value without being able to ascertain to whom it belonged , he always insisted upon the child 's carrying it back to the place from which it had been brought . [ GU ]</p>
   <p>No one it might be thought could , as has been described , convert his body into a machine , as it were , of industry for the humblest uses , and keep his thoughts so frequently bent upon secular concerns , without grievous injury to the more precious parts of his nature . How could the powers of intellect thrive , or its graces be displayed , in the midst of circumstances apparently so unfavourable , and where , to the direct cultivation of the mind , so small a portion of time was allotted ? But , in this extraordinary man , things in their nature adverse were reconciled . His conversation was remarkable , not only for being chaste and pure , but for the degree in which it was fervent and eloquent ; his written style was correct , simple , and animated . Nor did his affections suffer more than his intellect ; he was tenderly alive to all the duties of his pastoral office : the poor and needy “ he never sent empty away , ” the stranger was fed and refreshed in passing that unfrequented vale ,— the sick were visited ; and the feelings of humanity found further exercise among the distresses and embarrassments in the worldly estate of his neighbours , with which his talents for business made him acquainted ; and the disinterestedness , impartiality , and uprightness which he maintained in the management of all affairs confided to him , were virtues seldom separated in his own conscience from religious obligation . Nor could such conduct fail to remind those who witnessed it of a spirit nobler than law or custom : they felt convictions which , but for such intercourse , could not have been afforded , that , as in the practice of their pastor , there was no guile , so in his faith there was nothing hollow ; and we are warranted in believing , that upon these occasions , selfishness , obstinacy , and discord would often give way before the breathings of his goodwill and saintly integrity . It may be presumed also — while his humble congregation were listening to the moral precepts which he delivered from the pulpit , and to the Christian exhortations that they should love their neighbours as themselves , and do as they would be done unto — that peculiar efficacy was given to the preacher 's labours by recollections in the minds of his congregation , that they were called upon to do no more than his own actions were daily setting before their eyes .</p>
   <p>The afternoon service in the chapel was less numerously attended than that of the morning , but by a more serious auditory ; the lesson from the New Testament , on those occasions , was accompanied by Burkitt 's Commentaries . These lessons he read with impassioned emphasis , frequently drawing tears from his hearers , and leaving a lasting impression upon their minds . His devotional feelings and the powers of his own mind were further exercised , along with those of his family , in perusing the Scriptures : not only on the Sunday evenings , but on every other evening , while the rest of the household were at work , some one of the children , and in her turn the servant , for the sake of practice in reading , or for instruction , read the Bible aloud ; and in this manner the whole was repeatedly gone through . That no common importance was attached to the observance of religious ordinances by his family , appears from the following memorandum by one of his descendants , which I am tempted to insert at length , as it is characteristic , and somewhat curious . “ There is a small chapel in the county palatine of Lancaster , where a certain clergyman has regularly officiated above sixty years , and a few months ago administered the sacrament of the Lord 's Supper in the same , to a decent number of devout communicants . After the clergyman had received himself , the first company out of the assembly who approached the altar , and kneeled down to be partakers of the sacred elements , consisted of the parson 's wife , to whom he had been married upwards of sixty years ; one son and his wife ; four daughters , each with her husband ; whose ages , all added together , amount to above 714 years . The several and respective distances from the place of each of their abodes , to the chapel where they all communicated , will measure more than 1000 English miles . Though the narration will appear surprising , it is without doubt a fact that the same persons , exactly four years before , met at the same place , and all joined in performance of the same venerable duty . ”</p>
   <p>He was indeed most zealously attached to the doctrine and frame of the Established Church . We have seen him congratulating himself that he had no dissenters in his cure of any denomination . Some allowance must be made for the state of opinion when his first religious impressions were received , before the reader will acquit him of bigotry , when I mention , that at the time of the augmentation of the cure , he refused to invest part of the money in the purchase of an estate offered to him upon advantageous terms , because the proprietor was a Quaker ;— whether from scrupulous apprehension that a blessing would not attend a contract framed for the benefit of the church between persons not in religious sympathy with each other ; or , as a seeker of peace , he was afraid of the uncomplying disposition which at one time was too frequently conspicuous in that sect . Of this an instance had fallen under his own notice ; for , while he taught school at Loweswater , certain persons of that denomination had refused to pay annual interest due [ GV ] under the title of Church-stock ; [ GW ] a great hardship upon the incumbent , for the curacy of Loweswater was then scarcely less poor than that of Seathwaite . To what degree this prejudice of his was blameable need not be determined ;— certain it is , that he was not only desirous , as he himself says , to live in peace , but in love , with all men . He was placable , and charitable in his judgments ; and , however correct in conduct and rigorous to himself , he was ever ready to forgive the trespasses of others , and to soften the censure that was cast upon their frailties .— It would be unpardonable to omit that , in the maintenance of his virtues , he received due support from the partner of his long life . She was equally strict , in attending to her share of their joint cares , nor less diligent in her appropriate occupations . A person who had been some time their servant in the latter part of their lives , concluded the panegyric of her mistress by saying to me , “ She was no less excellent than her husband ; she was good to the poor , she was good to every thing ! ” He survived for a short time this virtuous companion . When she died , he ordered that her body should be borne to the grave by three of her daughters and one grand-daughter ; and , when the corpse was lifted from the threshold , he insisted upon lending his aid , and feeling about , for he was then almost blind , took hold of a napkin fixed to the coffin ; and , as a bearer of the body , entered the chapel , a few steps from the lowly parsonage .</p>
   <p>What a contrast does the life of this obscurely-seated , and , in point of worldly wealth , poorly-repaid Churchman , present to that of a Cardinal Wolsey !</p>

   <p>We have been dwelling upon images of peace in the moral world , that have brought us again to the quiet enclosure of consecrated ground , in which this venerable pair lie interred . The sounding brook , that rolls close by the churchyard , without disturbing feeling or meditation , is now unfortunately laid bare ; but not long ago it participated , with the chapel , the shade of some stately ash-trees , which will not spring again . While the spectator from this spot is looking round upon the girdle of stony mountains that encompasses the vale ,— masses of rock , out of which monuments for all men that ever existed might have been hewn — it would surprise him to be told , as with truth he might be , that the plain blue slab dedicated to the memory of this aged pair is a production of a quarry in North Wales . It was sent as a mark of respect by one of their descendants from the vale of Festiniog , a region almost as beautiful as that in which it now lies !</p>
   <p>Upon the Seathwaite Brook , at a small distance from the parsonage , has been erected a mill for spinning yarn ; it is a mean and disagreeable object , though not unimportant to the spectator , as calling to mind the momentous changes wrought by such inventions in the frame of society — changes which have proved especially unfavourable to these mountain solitudes . So much had been effected by those new powers , before the subject of the preceding biographical sketch closed his life , that their operation could not escape his notice , and doubtless excited touching reflections upon the comparatively insignificant results of his own manual industry . But Robert Walker was not a man of times and circumstances : had he lived at a later period , the principle of duty would have produced application as unremitting ; the same energy of character would have been displayed , though in many instances with widely different effects .</p>
   <p>With pleasure I annex , as illustrative and confirmatory of the above account , extracts from a paper in the Christian Remembrancer , October 1819 : it bears an assumed signature , but is known to be the work of the Rev . Robert Bamford , vicar of Bishopton , in the county of Durham ; a great-grandson of Mr. Walker , whose worth it commemorates , by a record not the less valuable for being written in very early youth .</p>
   <p>“ His house was a nursery of virtue . All the inmates were industrious , and cleanly , and happy . Sobriety , neatness , quietness , characterised the whole family . No railings , no idleness , no indulgence of passion were permitted . Every child , however young , had its appointed engagements ; every hand was busy . Knitting , spinning , reading , writing , mending clothes , making shoes , were by the different children constantly performing . The father himself sitting amongst them , and guiding their thoughts , was engaged in the same occupations ....</p>
   <p>“ He sate up late , and rose early ; when the family were at rest , he retired to a little room which he had built on the roof of his house . He had slated it , and fitted it up with shelves for his books , his stock of cloth , wearing apparel , and his utensils . There many a cold winter 's night , without fire , while the roof was glazed with ice , did he remain reading or writing , till the day dawned . He taught the children in the chapel , for there was no schoolhouse . Yet in that cold , damp place he never had a fire . He used to send the children in parties either to his own fire at home , or make them run up the mountain side .</p>
   <p>“ It may be further mentioned , that he was a passionate admirer of Nature ; she was his mother , and he was a dutiful child . While engaged on the mountains , it was his greatest pleasure to view the rising sun ; and in tranquil evenings , as it slided behind the hills , he blessed its departure . He was skilled in fossils and plants ; a constant observer of the stars and winds : the atmosphere was his delight . He made many experiments on its nature and properties . In summer he used to gather a multitude of flies and insects , and , by his entertaining description , amuse and instruct his children . They shared all his daily employments , and derived many sentiments of love and benevolence from his observations on the works and productions of nature . Whether they were following him in the field , or surrounding him in school , he took every opportunity of storing their minds with useful information .— Nor was the circle of his influence confined to Seathwaite . Many a distant mother has told her child of Mr. Walker , and begged him to be as good a man .</p>
   <p>“ Once , when I was very young , I had the pleasure of seeing and hearing that venerable old man in his 90th year , and even then , the calmness , the force , the perspicuity of his sermon , sanctified and adorned by the wisdom of grey hairs , and the authority of virtue , had such an effect upon my mind , that I never see a hoary-headed clergyman , without thinking of Mr. Walker .... He allowed no dissenter or methodist to interfere in the instruction of the souls committed to his cure : and so successful were his exertions , that he had not one dissenter of any denomination whatever in the whole parish . Though he avoided all religious controversies , yet when age had silvered his head , and virtuous piety had secured to his appearance reverence and silent honour , no one , however determined in his hatred of apostolic descent , could have listened to his discourse on ecclesiastical history and ancient times , without thinking , that one of the beloved apostles had returned to mortality , and in that vale of peace had come to exemplify the beauty of holiness in the life and character of Mr. Walker .</p>
   <p>“ Until the sickness of his wife , a few months previous to her death , his health and spirits and faculties were unimpaired . But this misfortune gave him such a shock , that his constitution gradually decayed . His senses , except sight , still preserved their powers . He never preached with steadiness after his wife 's death . His voice faltered : he always looked at the seat she had used . He could not pass her tomb without tears . He became , when alone , sad and melancholy , though still among his friends kind and good-humoured . He went to bed about twelve o'clock the night before his death . As his custom was , he went , tottering and leaning upon his daughter 's arm , to examine the heavens , and meditate a few moments in the open air . ‘ How clear the moon shines to-night ! ’ He said these words , sighed , and laid down . At six next morning he was found a corpse . Many a tear , and many a heavy heart , and many a grateful blessing followed him to the grave . "[ GY ]</p>
   <p>Having mentioned in this narrative the vale of Loweswater as a place where Mr. Walker taught school , I will add a few memoranda from its parish register , respecting a person apparently of desires as moderate , with whom he must have been intimate during his residence there .</p>

   <p>“ This curacy was twice augmented by Queen Anne 's Bounty . The first payment , with great difficulty , was paid to Mr. John Curwen of London , on the 9th of May , 1724 , deposited by me , Henry Forest , curate of Loweswater . Yᵉ said 9th of May , yᵉ said Mr. Curwen went to the office , and saw my name registered there , etc . This , by the Providence of God , came by lot to this poor place .</p>
   <p>“ Hæc testor H. FOREST . ”</p>
   <p>In another place he records , that the sycamore trees were planted in the churchyard in 1710 .</p>
   <p>He died in 1741 , having been curate thirty-four years . It is not improbable that H. Forest was the gentleman who assisted Robert Walker in his classical studies at Loweswater .</p>

   <p>“ If in this Sonnet I should seem to have borne a little too hard upon the personal appearance of the worthy Poissardes of Calais , let me take shelter under the authority of my lamented friend , the late Sir George Beaumont . He , a most accurate observer , used to say of them , that their features and countenances seemed to have conformed to those of the creatures they dealt in ; at all events the resemblance was striking . ” — W. W. 1822 .</p>
   <p>In Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal of this Tour on the Continent ,— which , in a letter to her daughter Dorothy ( dated 20th February 1821 ) , she calls “ hasty notes made by snatches during our journey , ” — the following occurs :— “ Passing through the gates of the city , we had before us a line of white-capped Fish-women , with thin brown faces . The fish very foul , yet at dinner the same sort proved excellent . ”</p>
   <p>In Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal of the same Tour , the following occurs :— “ Tuesday , 11th July . Calais .— With one consent we stopped to gaze at a group — rather a line of women and girls , seated beside dirty fish baskets under the old gate-way and ramparts — their white night caps , brown and puckered faces , bright eyes , etc . etc ., very striking . The arrangements — how unlike those of a fish-market in the South of England !...</p>
   <p>“ Every one is struck with the excessive ugliness ( if I may apply the word to any human creatures ) of the fish-women of Calais , and that no one can forget . ” — ED .</p>
   <p>Henry Crabb Robinson wrote of this sonnet :— “ Of the sonnets there is one remarkable and unique ; the humour and naïveté , and the exquisitely refined sentiment of the Calais fish-women , are a combination of excellencies quite novel . ” ( Diary , etc ., vol . ii . p . 224 . ) — ED .</p>

   <p>W. W. 1822 .</p>
   <p>“ In this city are many vestiges of the splendour of the Burgundian Dukedom , and the long black mantle universally worn by the females is probably a remnant of the old Spanish connection , which , if I do not much deceive myself , is traceable in the grave deportment of its inhabitants . Bruges is comparatively little disturbed by that curious contest , or rather conflict , of Flemish with French propensities in matters of taste , so conspicuous through other parts of Flanders . The hotel to which we drove at Ghent furnished an odd instance . In the passages were paintings and statues , after the antique , of Hebe and Apollo ; and in the garden , a little pond , about a yard and a half in diameter , with a weeping willow bending over it , and under the shade of that tree , in the centre of the pond a wooden painted statue of a Dutch or Flemish boor , looking ineffably tender upon his mistress , and embracing her . A living duck , tethered at the feet of the sculptured lovers , alternately tormented a miserable eel and itself with endeavours to escape from its bonds and prison . Had we chanced to espy the hostess of the hotel in this quaint rural retreat , the exhibition would have been complete . She was a true Flemish figure , in the dress of the days of Holbein ; her symbol of office , a weighty bunch of keys , pendent from her portly waist . In Brussels , the modern taste in costume , architecture , etc ., has got the mastery ; in Ghent there is a struggle : but in Bruges old images are still paramount , and an air of monastic life among the quiet goings-on of a thinly-peopled city is inexpressibly soothing ; a pensive grace seems to be cast over all , even the very children . ” ( Extract from Journal . ) — W. W. 1822 .</p>
   <p>From Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal :— “ Thursday , 13th July ....— Bruges . What a place . D. and I walked out as soon as we could after our arrival .... Went into the old church . The nuns , the different worshippers , the pictures , the place , the quiet stately streets , grand buildings , graceful nun-like women in their long cloaks , treading with swan-like motions those silent avenues of majestic architecture , I must leave to D. to describe . My own mind was uplifted by a sort of devotional elevation as if striving to fit itself to become worthy of what these temples would lead to . ”</p>
   <p>“ ... Friday , 14th .— At Bruges all is silence , grace , and unmixed dignity .... You felt a sort of veneration for everything you looked upon . Nothing of this here ” [ i. e . at Ghent ] ; “ yet what a splendid place ! The evening too suited its character , for the sun went down in brightness . Yesterday was not a sunny day , and Bruges wanted no sunshine , its own outline in the gloom of evening needed no golden lustre . Yet this William witnessed , when D. and I were not with him , the great Tower of the Market House bathed in gold ! ”</p>
   <p>The following is from Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal :— “ Thursday , 13th July . Dunkirk .— We entered Bruges by a long gently-winding street , and were so animated with pleasure in our hasty course that it seemed we too soon reached the inn . W. and Mr. M. walked out immediately , eager to view the city in the warm light of the setting sun ....</p>
   <p>“ Continued to walk through the silent town till ten o'clock — no carts — no chaises — a cloistral silence felt in every corner and every open space , yet the large square was scattered over with groups of people ; or passengers walking to and fro , no lights in the houses ! ” — ED .</p>

   <p>See the note to the last sonnet . The following is from Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal :— “ Friday , 14th . Bruges .— Rose at five o'clock , paced the town again , and visited , but with disturbed mind ( for I had left William in bed hurting himself with a sonnet ) , the churches of St. Salvador and Notre Dame .... I joined W. in our carriage , and have here written down the sonnet , Jones ’ Parsonage , so I hope he will be at rest . ”</p>
   <p>The following is from Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal :— “ Friday , 14th July . Bruges .— The morning was bright , sunshine and shade falling upon the lines of houses , and the out-juttings of the more noble buildings . In the bright light of morning the same tender melancholy was over the city as in the sober time of twilight , yet with intervening images of rural life . A few peasants were now entering the town , and the rattling of a rustic cart , prettily laden with vegetables fresh from the soil , gave a gentle stirring to the fancy . Early as it was , people of all ages were abroad chiefly on their way to the churches : the figure , gait , and motions of the women in harmony with the collegiate air of the streets , and the processions and solemnities of Catholic worship . Such figures might have walked through these streets , two hundred years ago ; streets bearing no stamp of progress or of decay . One might fancy that as the city had been built so it had remained . We first went to the Church of St. Salvador , a venerable Gothic edifice . Within the Church , our walk between the lofty pillars was very solemn . We saw in perspective the marble floor scattered over , at irregular distances , with people of all ages — standing , or upon their knees , silent , yet making such motions as the order of their devotions prescribed , crossing themselves , beating their breasts , or telling their beads . Such the general appearance of the worshippers : but the gestures of some were more impassioned ....</p>
   <p>“ We spent some time in admiring the beauty of the choir , and every other part of this noble building , adorned as it is with statues ; and pictures not in the paltry style of the Churches at Calais and Fernes ; but works of art that would be interesting anywhere , and are much more so in these sacred places , where the wretched and the happy , the poor and the rich are alike invited to cast away worldly feelings , and may be elevated by the representations of Scripture history , or of the sufferings and glory of martyrs and saints . ”</p>
   <p>In the final arrangement of his poems , Wordsworth placed the one entitled Incident at Brugès — which belonged to the year 1828 — after the two sonnets on Brugès in these “ Memorials of a Tour on the Continent in 1820 . ” In the present edition the former poem is restored to its chronological place ( see vol . vii . ) , where it is associated with A Jewish Family . As a consequence the numbering of the poems differs slightly from that which Wordsworth finally adopted .— ED .</p>

   <p>“ Namur , Tuesday 18th .— Our ride yesterday , except for the intervention of Waterloo , and its interests , which were so melancholy that I do not like to touch upon them , was a dull one , though the road was pleasant through the forest of Soignies . Waterloo , its pretty chapel , the walls within covered with monuments , recording the fall of many of our brave countrymen , and some few others as brave , La Haye Sainte , La Belle Alliance , Quatre Bras . Dined at Genappe ; two bullet shots in the wainscot of the room , which , during the battle , had been heaped with dead and dying . ” ( From Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal . )</p>
   <p>“ Monday , 17th July , Brussels .— I could understand little till we got to the field of battle , where we stood upon an elevation ; and thence , looking round upon every memorable spot , by help of gesture and action , and the sounds ‘ les Anglois , les Francois , ’ etc . etc ., I gathered up a small portion of the story , helped out by a few monuments erected to the memory of the slain ; but all round , there was no other visible record of slaughter : the wide fields were covered with luxuriant crops , just as they had been before the battles , except that now the corn was nearly ripe , and then it was green . We stood upon grass , and corn fields where heaps of our countrymen lay buried beneath our feet . There was little to be seen , but much to be felt ; sorrow and sadness , and even something like horror breathed out of the ground as we stood upon it ! ” ( From Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal , vol . i . ) Compare the two sonnets Occasioned by the Battle of Waterloo , February , 1816 , also the Thanksgiving Ode .— ED .</p>

   <p>[ The scenery on the Meuse pleases me more , upon the whole , than that of the Rhine , though the river itself is much inferior in grandeur . The rocks , both in form and colour , especially between Namur and Liege , surpass any upon the Rhine , though they are in several places disfigured by quarries , whence stones were taken for the new fortifications . This is much to be regretted , for they are useless , and the scars will remain perhaps for thousands of years . A like injury to a still greater degree has been inflicted , in my memory , upon the beautiful rocks of Clifton , on the banks of the Avon . There is probably in existence a very long letter of mine to Sir Uvedale Price , in which was given a description of the landscapes on the Meuse as compared with those on the Rhine .</p>
   <p>Details in the spirit of these sonnets are given both in Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journals and my Sister 's , and the reperusal of them has strengthened a wish long entertained that somebody would put together , as in one work , the notices contained in them , omitting particulars that were written down merely to aid our memory , and bringing the whole into as small a compass as is consistent with the general interests belonging to the scenes , circumstances , and objects touched on by each writer .— I .

   <p>The following extract from Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal illustrates this sonnet , and explains the Fenwick note . The “ long entertained ” “ wish ” of the poet , expressed in that note , has never yet been accomplished . It may be realised in one of the volumes which follow , in this edition .</p>
   <p>“ July 18 . Departure from Namur , road out of the town beautiful , wide , disk-like valley , gardens , groves , town standing upon its two rivers . Ramparts towering above , very impressive to cast the eyes back upon . Market people flocking in in groups , variety of dresses , of all gay colours . Flowers seem to be the delight of the peasantry . They are worn in their hats , upon their breasts , carried in the mouth when their hands are at work sometimes , or stuck behind the ear . Road excellent all the way down the Meuse . Villages in all situations ,— among the rocks , now one peeps out of a recess , again another upon a knoll with its spire rising from among trees . More and more beautiful as you proceed down the river — rocks on the banks of the most fantastic forms , something like those on the Wye . Sometimes the valley reminded us of the trough of the Clyde . Huy . Church handsome , the high tower struck by lightning fourteen years ago ; new fortifications , most picturesque and romantic situation . Crossed the Meuse here , charming view from the bridge .... Road very delightful , rocks , woods , chateau , convent , vineyards , hanging gardens , orchards with profusion of fruit , shrubs , and flowers , and corn lands , all in the most luxuriant state . So beautiful a day 's journey I never before travelled . ”</p>
   <p>The following is from Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal , vol . i .:— “ Tuesday , July 18 . Namur .— Having traversed the Vale , we travel downwards , with the stately , though muddy , river to our left — pass under limestone rocks resembling abbeys or castles — the opening prospect still presenting something new . Backwards , a noble view of the vale , terminated by the city and fortifications of Namur at the distance of , perhaps , two miles or more — our last farewell view ! Still , as we go on , the rocks change their shapes , in prospect far off ; or as we roll swiftly away beneath them . Villages not to be numbered by the hasty traveller , rise up , with spires and towers ; cottages embowered in gardens and orchards , and sometimes an old chateau or modern villa . All these ( in succession or together ) vary the scene , while , the abundance of flowers , fruit , vegetables , and corn , interbedded and intermingled , give an image of plenty and happy industry . ” — ED .</p>

   <p>“ Let a wall of rocks be imagined from three to six hundred feet in height , and rising between France and Spain , so as physically to separate the two kingdoms — let us fancy this wall curved like a crescent with its convexity towards France . Lastly , let us suppose , that in the very middle of the wall a breach of 300 feet wide has been beaten down by the famous Roland , and we may have a good idea of what the mountaineers call the ‘ BRECHE DE ROLEND . ’ ” ( Raymond 's Pyrenees . ) — W.

   <p>“ Thursday , 20th July .—... Descend towards the town of Aix-la-Chapelle , a chapel on the opposite side of the vale upon a high knoll , overlooking the spires and towers .... Wm ., T. M ., and myself walked to the chapel we had seen on the heights , said to be built by Charlemagne : a very interesting view of the town , and over a large space of the country beyond , and into the country looking the other way . Wm . went higher to a monument recording that Buonaparte visited the spot with one attendant . We were too late to be satisfied here , the darkness only allowing us to form a notion of the outline , and to catch here and there a spire or a tower in the distance . The chapel here alluded to was not larger in appearance than the tiny rocky edifice at Buttermere . A Christ under the branches of a spreading oak , brought to my mind by contrast , a gay image of a brightly painted fox , on a sign board , among the branches of a flowing chestnut tree , which William and I saw gleaming in the setting sun , when walking through the village of Souldren . ” ( From Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal . )</p>
   <p>“ Thursday , 20th July . Aix-la-Chapelle .— I went to the Cathedral , a curious Building where are to be seen the chair of Charlemagne , on which the Emperors were formerly crowned , some marble pillars much older than his time ; and many pictures ; but I could not stay to examine any of these curiosities , and gladly made my way alone back to the inn to rest there . The market-place is a fine old square ; but at Aix-la-Chapelle there is always a mighty preponderance of poverty and dulness , except in a few of the showiest of the streets , and even there , a flashy meanness , a slight patchery of things falling to pieces is everywhere visible . ” ( From Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal , vol . i . ) — ED .</p>

   <p>“ Friday , July 21 . Cologne .—... The Cathedral , a most magnificent edifice . Tower unfinished ( this I perceived , but took it for a ruin at ten miles distance ) , built 700 years ago . The outside reminds you of Westminster Abbey in parts ; and , had the Projector 's wish been fulfilled , within and without , this would have been a much more sumptuous pile . It affectingly called to my mind William 's lines —</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Within the fluted Pillars are very grand ; the dimensions , 180 German feet high , 700 long , and 500 broad . A curious old picture , 450 years old . Subject , the 3 Kings of Cologne in the centre ( for it was divided into three parts , and kept shut up to protect it ) , and on the sides Ursula and the 11 , 000 virgins , by Ralfe ; mounted 250 steps to the top of the unfinished Tower , and had a fine prospect of the river winding its way towards Dusseldorf .... The cathedral — that august and solemnly impressive Temple .... William in his musing way .... ” ( From Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal . )</p>
   <p>“ Friday , 21st July . Cologne .— I cannot attempt to describe the Cathedral ; nor indeed could any skill of mine do justice to that august pile , even if I might have lingered half a day among its walls . At our entrance , the evening sunshine rested upon portions of some of the hundred massy columns ; while the shade and gloom , spread through the edifice , were deepened by those brilliant touches of golden light . Some of the painted windows were beautified by the melting together and the intermingling of colours , reflected upon the stone-work , colours and shapes , to the eye as unsubstantial as light itself , and visionary as the rainbow . The choir is hung with tapestry , designed by Rubens . It does , I think , to an unlearned eye somewhat resemble Henry the Seventh 's chapel at Westminster , but is much loftier and larger . The long lancet-shaped painted windows are beautiful . The pillars and arches through the aisles of this Cathedral are of grey stone , sober , solemn , of great size , yet exquisitely proportioned ; and no paltry images or tinselled altars disturb the one impression of awful magnificence , an impression received at once , and not to be overcome by regrets , that only the Choir and side aisles are finished . The nave , at half its destined height , is covered with a ceiling of boards . The exterior of this stupendous edifice is of massy , though most beautiful , architecture . Some of the lighter wreaths of stone-work ( if great things may be compared with small ) made me think of the Chapel of Roslin in its sequestered dell , where the adder 's tongue and fern are mingled with green-grown flowers , and leaves of stone that neither fall nor fade . Flowers and bushes here grow out of the gigantic ruins — yet ruins they are not ; for as the Builder 's hand left the unfinished work , so it appears to have remained in firmness and strength unshakable , while Nature has made her own of ornaments framed in imitation of her works , having overspread them with her colouring , and blended them with the treasures of her lonely places . ” ( From Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal , vol . i . ) — ED .</p>

   <p>“ Saturday 22nd .— We were anxious , at least Wm . was , to be in Switzerland , and we must follow our destiny . Leaving the rich plain , came to the fine range of mountains we saw yesterday , and to the side of the glorious river , by which we have since travelled . Magnificent heights on its banks . The most abrupt and fantastic outlines ; Convents ( what an exquisite one that first which pushed itself forward on the green shore , where the river bends in its course ) ; Ruined Castles , looking at each other from aloft , or down upon the convents , lurk in the woody clefts ; picturesque Villages with their spires , at every turn of this stately winding river ; beautiful road following its windings ; every variety of form given to the rocks ; and affecting intimations brought to mind , by the frequent oratories and crosses , here neither tawdry nor obtrusive . After changing horses at Remengen , lost sight for a while of our noble companion , which soon reappeared stretching along a more widely-spread vale ; the green hills softly retiring , vineyards climbing up their sides , and into every crevice ; corn yellow-green , the different crops richly filling the centre of the vale ; the fine road , bordered now by apple-trees laden with fruit , now open to the undivided plain . Again the hills approached , and never was beheld a grander display of Nature 's works and of human Art , than continued in succession to feast our eyes and imaginations . D. noted the objects individually , in one of the most beautiful passages ” ( of her journal ) . ( Mrs . Wordsworth . )</p>
   <p>“ Saturday , 22nd July . Cologne .— For some miles , the traveller goes through the magnificent plain , which from its great width appears almost circular . Though unseen the river Rhine , we never can forget that it is there ! When the vale becomes narrower , one of the most interesting and beautiful of prospects opens on the view from a gentle rising in the road . On an island stands a large grey convent , sadly pensive among its garden walls and embowering wood . The musket and cannon have spared that sanctuary , and we were told that , though the establishment is dissolved , a few of the nuns still remain there , attached to the spot ; or probably having neither friends or other home to repair to . On the right bank of the river , opposite to us , is a bold precipice , bearing on its summit a ruined fortress which looks down upon the convent ; and the warlike and religious Edifices are connected together by a chivalrous story of slighted or luckless love , which caused the withdrawing of a fair Damsel to the Island , where she founded the monastery . Another bold ruin stands upon an eminence adjoining , and all these monuments of former times combine with villages and churches , and dells ( between the steeps ) green or corn-clad , and with the majestic River ( here spread out like a lake ) to compose a most affectingly beautiful scene , whether viewed in prospect or in retrospect . Still we rolled along ( ah ! far too swiftly ! and often did I wish that I were a youthful traveller on foot ) , still we rolled along , meeting the flowing River , smooth as glass , yet so rapid that the stream of motion is always perceptible , even from a great distance . The riches of this region are not easily fancied ,— the pretty paths , the gardens among plots of vineyard and corn , cottages peeping from the shade , villages and spires , in never-ending variety . ” ( From Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal , vol . i . ) — ED .</p>

   <p>“ 26th July .— Reached Heidelberg .... We walked a while about the garden and ruins of the Castle . Looked down upon the grey-roofed Town , with its Cathedral running parallel with the river Neckar , over which , by a fine bridge , we had crossed on entering ; boats shooting curiously over the rapids ; vines , hanging gardens climbing up the hill , clothing the rocks , and creeping into their crevices , on every side of us , and up to the very point where we stood . The Town , with its squares and fountains , its narrow long streets , with arched gateways , towers , and spires , courts , and quaint flower gardens , fill the deep valley . The river disappears , winding away among the hills to the right . Before us it holds a direct course — through a widening tract of the same prolific country — to the Rhine , seen in the distance .... 27th ... The passage through the bridge being somewhat dangerous , those who accompany the rafts , as they approach , fall down upon their knees to pray , then raise their voices and sing an appropriate anthem till the peril is past . ” ( Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal . )</p>
   <p>“ Friday , 28th July . Heidelberg .— The River flows beside it calmly ( though with strong motion as all these large rivers do ) , but after that point , to the Bridge , the channel is rocky , and therefore the stream turbulent . While passing under the garden-wall , the peasant sailor , before he trusts his boat or timber-raft to the rocks and rapids , kneels down and prays for protection from danger , and a safe passage through the arches of the Bridge . An Image of Jesus on the cross is the visible object of his worship , which Mr. Pickford , when he rebuilt his garden-wall , replaced in its station , out of respect to the piety or superstition of past and present times . During the passage an appropriate hymn is chaunted — the thought touched our poet 's fancy , and he has since composed the following verses for the Heidelberg boatmen . ” ( From Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal , vol . i . )</p>
   <p>In the edition of 1822 a sonnet followed this Hymn , entitled The Jung-Frau — and the Rhine at Shauffhausen . In the edition of 1827 it was transferred to the series of “ Ecclesiastical Sonnets , ” under the title of its first line , “ Down a swift Stream , thus far , a bold design , ” which place it retained in all subsequent editions ( see Part III . No . xii . ) The following note accompanied the sonnet in the edition of 1822 :— “ This Sonnet belongs to another publication , but from its fitness for this place is inserted here also .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Before this quarter of the Black Forest was inhabited , the source of the Danube might have suggested some of those sublime images which Armstrong has so finely described ; at present the contrast is most striking . The Spring appears in a capacious Stone Basin upon the front of a Ducal palace , with a pleasure-ground opposite ; then , passing under the pavement , takes the form of a little , clear , bright , black , vigorous rill , barely wide enough to tempt the agility of a child five years old to leap over it ,— and , entering the Garden , it joins , after a course of a few hundred yards , a Stream much more considerable than itself . The copiousness of the Spring at Doneschingen must have procured for it the honour of being named the Source of the Danube .— W . W. 1822 .</p>
   <p>“ Monday , 31st July .—... We drew towards the town of Villingen , a foreign-looking place standing in the descent , and lifting up its metallic dome-like spires , without the accompaniment of a single tree .... The Church with its two-fold spire glittered in the hot sunshine , like pewter in a melting state . Our guide had told us that near this place the Danube took its rise ; but not so .... At Doneschingen changed horses again . Here we laved in the water which flowed from the source of the majestic Danube , a little , clear , bright , black rill , that issuing from a capacious stone fountain , into which it springs , crosses the road , and glides rapidly along the side of a beautiful pleasure-ground .... We washed , drank , and luxuriated in the cool and pure waters of this rill , unwilling to quit what we were not again to see — a reality very different from the stately Danube , so long an image to the imagination . ” ( Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal . )</p>
   <p>“ Tuesday , 1st August . Villingen .— The landlord seemed to entertain high ideas of this his native place — its modern improvements in gardens and its former grandeur — and told us that one of his servants should conduct us to the palace , the gardens , the baths , and last of all , though most the object of our curiosity , to the source of the DANUBE ....</p>
   <p>“ But I seem to have forgotten the source of the Danube , which truly was ‘ another '[ HL ] Danube after we had seen it ; or , more properly speaking , after we had seen the moor-land country surrounding the Town of Doneschingen , where we knew we should meet with the source of that famous river ; and it is not only there ( in that Hollow wild without grandeur ) , but actually within the walls of the Duke 's courts adjoining the trim flower garden . The bountiful spring is received by a large square stone basin , and thence flows through the gardens in a narrow stream like a vigorous mill-race . Had an active boy been by our side he would have over-leapt it . That streamlet , after the course of a few hundred yards , falls into the bed of the united rivers the P —— and the P —— which take their rise in the moorish hills seen on the right in the road from Villingen , and which we looked upon from the gardens at the same time that we saw the new-born streamlet ( called the source of the Danube ) gush into their channel . I suppose it must be the remarkable strength of the spring which has caused it to be dignified with its title ; for certainly those other two streams ( united a little above the gardens ) are the primary sources ( of this branch at least ) of the Danube . ” ( From Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal , vol . i . )</p>
   <p>What Dorothy Wordsworth mentions in reference to the Danube occurs in many other rivers ; e. g . the source of the Clyde , in Scotland , is a tiny burn in Lanarkshire , which , after a short moorland course , falls ( near Elvanfoot ) into the large stream of the Daur — the latter having come down for many miles from the Lead Hills district . The P —— and P —— is probably a mistake for B —— and B ——. The mountain torrent of the Bregé in the Schwartzwald is joined by the Bregach , and when the stream receives the waters from the spring in the Castle Garden of Doneschingen it becomes the Danube .— ED .</p>

   <p>The Staubbach is a narrow Stream , which , after a long course on the heights , comes to the sharp edge of a somewhat overhanging precipice , overleaps it with a bound , and , after a fall of 930 feet , forms again a rivulet . The vocal powers of these musical Beggars may seem to be exaggerated ; but this wild and savage air was utterly unlike any sounds I had ever heard ; the notes reached me from a distance , and on what occasion they were sung I could not guess , only they seemed to belong , in some way or other , to the Waterfall — and reminded me of religious services chaunted to Streams and Fountains in Pagan times .— W .

Mr. Southey has thus accurately characterised the peculiarity of this music : “ While we were at the Waterfall , some half-score peasants , chiefly women and girls , assembled just out of reach of the Spring , and set up — surely , the wildest chorus that ever was heard by human ears ,— a song not of articulate sounds , but in which the voice was used as a mere instrument of music , more flexible than any which art could produce ,— sweet , powerful , and thrilling beyond description . ” ( See Notes to A Tale of Paraguay . ) — W. W. 1837 .</p>
   <p>“ Thursday , 10th Aug ....— Walked to the Staubbach , the thin veil-like mist-besprinkled waterfall , that slips over the edge of an immensely high perpendicular rock — which , when we saw it by the morning light , was accompanied by a beautiful rainbow ; spanning , like the arch of a bridge , the vapour at the base of the rock . Singing Girls . But I must not neglect to speak of the beauty of the early morning , in the magnificent pass between Interlachen and Lauterbrunnen . The river from Jungfrau bounding down with great force , bringing a very cold air from the snowy regions . Cottages with their green summer plots climbing up in all directions , to the very skirts of these icy regions . Two that looked so beautiful in the sunshine . Women and children busy with their little lot of hay . Men mowing . ” ( Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal . )</p>
   <p>“ Thursday , 10th August . Interlachen .— The Staubbach is a narrow stream , which , after a long course on the heights , comes to the sharp edge of a somewhat overhanging precipice , overleaps it with a bound , and , after a fall of 930 feet , forms again a rivulet , that passing through a green sloping pasture crosses the road , and thence through the heaving grounds , takes its clear waters to the grey torrent of the Leutshen . When tracking with my young guide the rivulet to its momentary resting-place , a small basin at the foot of the cataract , two women appeared before me singing a shrill and savage air ; the tones were startling , and in connection with their wild yet quiet figures strangely combined with the sounds of dashing water and the silent aspect of the huge crag that seemed to reach the sky ! The morning sun falling on this side of the valley , a circular rainbow was seen when we were there , between the Fall and the Rock , the space being several yards , and you stand within that space in a bath of dew . I was close to the women when they began to sing , and hence , probably , it was that I perceived nothing of sweetness in their tones . I cannot answer for the impression on the rest of the party except my brother , who being behind , heard the carol from a distance ; and the description he gives of it is similar to Mr. Southey 's in his Journal . ” ( From Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal , vol . i . ) — ED .</p>

   <p>“ Saturday , Aug . 12 .— It is now half-past twelve o'clock , and I am sitting upon a sort of myrtle bed under a pine grove among the rocks , down which the headlong Aar cleaves its way , having dined in the cabin at Handeck , in close neighbourhood with our steeds . All that we have hitherto seen seemed at the moment but a faint preparation for the delights of this day . The beautiful valley we left behind us , the groves , the forest of oak and pine , the glades , the one particularly in which we met that ‘ Hoifer , ’ as we called him , with his heron 's crest proudly reared upon his head , a little page carrying his accoutrements . He with many others , but none like this Hero , there was repairing to shoot for a prize at Meyringen . Then , those lovely vales , that circular one , the pride of them all , which led us to the savage Pass and giant Pines , where lurks this King of Waterfalls . What delicious couches to rest upon . Here to linger out a long summer 's day would be a luxury . A more sober passage home — our spirits a little , but very little , damped by the stretch of enjoyment . ” ( Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal . )</p>
   <p>“ Saturday , 12th August . Meyringen .— Crossed the stream , and re-crossed it , and from a stony hollow , uninhabited , came into the gloom of a pine forest , which led us , by a steep ascent , to the rocks surrounding the Fall of the Aar . Long before our approach , we heard the roaring , while that sound was deadened by the intermediate rocks and trees ; but when standing on a bank , in front of the cataract , I could have believed at the first moment , that it was louder even than that of the Rhine at Schaffhausen . This impression , no doubt , was owing chiefly to its being confined within a narrow space . The pine-clad precipices , especially on the opposite side , are very lofty , rising from the rocks of the Pass , kept bare by continual wetting . The gloom of the forest-mountains , in harmony with the sombrous hue of the water , would , of itself , make this first view of this cataract much more impressive than that of the Reichenbach ; but again we looked in vain — not for delicate passages in the stream ;— those could not be thought of ;— but for some of those minute graces , and those overgrowings that detain us in admiration beside our own pellucid waterfalls . [ HN ] There is a grey furnace-like smoke of water , and a desperate motion and ferment , that make the head dizzy and stun the ears . ” ... “ We clambered upon other rocks ; and , at leisure , noticed the variety of shrubby plants and flowers , which here ( being higher than the stream ) grew securely , nursed by perpetual dews . Luxuriant tufts of a very large sedum were lodged on the ledges , or hung from dark crevices ; those tufts , in form and motion , as they waved and fluttered in the breeze of the cataract , resembling the plumes of a hearse , were an ornament well suited to the pine-clad steeps , and the heavenly beauty of the rainbow . ” ( From Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal , vol . i . ) — ED .</p>

   <p>“ Aug. 7th . We reached this place , Thun . Walked or sate in the groves at the foot of the Lake , then crossed the river by a boat , and wandered in delightful pleasure groves on the other side . Then , passing a gravelled path , which is carried round the woody hill , we found among many interesting objects , one that was very impressive , a plain oval slab , raised upon a stone seat , directly fronting the setting sun , which at that moment was shedding his latest rays upon it . It was this inscription which spoke more than an elaborate panegyric :—</p>
   <p>DEM ANDENKEN MEINES FREUNDES ALOYS REDING MDCCCXVIII . ”</p>
   <p>( Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal . )</p>
   <p>“ Monday , 7th August . Berne .— One of the inscriptions ( which I did not see ) was to the memory of Aloys Reding , a Friend of the possessor of these grounds . A happy chance led my Companions to the spot ; and here is the inscription copied by one of them :—</p>
   <p>DEM ANDENKEN MEINES FREUNDES ALOYS REDING MDCCCXVIII . ”</p>

   <p>The second stanza of this poem , entitled Composed in one of the Catholic Cantons , was in the original edition of 1822 , a part of the poem entitled The Church of San Salvador , seen from the Lake of Lugano . The other stanzas were first published in 1827 .</p>
   <p>Numerous references to “ the firm unmoving cross , ” and to</p>
   <p>the chapel far withdrawn , That lurks by lonely ways ,</p>
   <p>occur both in Mrs. Wordsworth 's and in Dorothy 's Journal . E. g . ( Crossing the St. Gotthard Pass ) “ Aug . 24 .—... Gained the top by a steep pull ; snow before and behind ; a crucifix , and oratories thicken upon our course as we draw near to the Hospice . ‘ Gales from Italy ’ blow fresh around . Snow on the roadside . Farther on a little cross under a rock .... We yesterday noticed five of these crosses , two placed under one rock , and three under another . ” “ Aug. 15 . ( Engelberg . ) —... Counted the wayside upright oratories ; found no less than sixteen before we reached the house , where we resumed our char-à-bancs . ” “ Aug. 8 . ( At Interlachen . ) —... The view that takes in the length of the Vale , following the snaky river with its islands , through those croft-like , woody , orchard meadows to Unterseen , with its weir , church , bridges , cottages , and that spiral edifice in the midst : Lake of Thun beyond , girt by mountains : Neissen , a pyramidal giant , predominant . Turning to the left towards Brientz , Ringenberg old Church tower rising from a high woody knoll . William and I came to it . ( I write on the spot . Wm . asleep . ) No entrance into the ruin , good view of Brientz Lake , and a little Loughrigg Tarn above , close under where we are seated among groves of limes , hazels , beeches , etc . ; clanking hammers , singing girl . ‘ Will no one tell me what she sings ? '[ HP ] A little further on , among those sylvan crofts , a scattered group of day or summer-deserted cabins ; plots of hemp spread in the sunshine tell us dwellers sometimes come here . Hence steps of rock led us to a temple of Nature 's own framing , roofed with ancient beech trees . Under one was firmly fixed in the ground a little upright stone , about a span in width , and three times that length . Upon it was roughly chisled a cross , not exactly a Christ-cross , but something like this .... I could not but feel that it might have been placed there by the Peasants , as a point to meet from their scattered sheds for worship . Natural seats , mossy or bare , like those in our own sylvan parlour ( upon Rydal Lake ) , all around in the rocks , kept up the idea ; and a more lovely and silent spot could not have been selected for a holy purpose : the little Tarn too in sight , in time of drought , ready to supply their rocky font with fresh water . ”</p>
   <p>“ Friday , 14th September . Martigny .— Passing the turn of the ascent , we come to another Cross , ( placed there to face the Traveller ascending from the other side ) , and , from the brow of the eminence , behold ! to our left , the huge Form of Mont Blanc — pikes , towers , needles , and wide wastes of everlasting snow in dazzling brightness . Below is the river Arve , a grey-white line , winding to the village of Chamouny , dimly seen in the distance . Our station , though on a height so commanding , was on the lowest point of the eminence ; and such as I have sketched ( but how imperfectly ! ) was the scene uplifted and outspread before us . The higher parts of the mountain in our neighbourhood are sprinkled with brown Chalets . So they were thirty years ago , as my Brother well remembered ; and he pointed out to us the very quarter from which a Boy greeted him and his companion with an Alpine cry —</p>

   <p>The only reference to a “ scene on the lake of Brientz ” in Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal which could have given rise to the preceding poem is the following :— “ William 's desires extended to a promontory , whence he hoped to see the termination of the lake , and thither he is gone to look out for the Boat , our friends being upon the water . I am left to rest under the shade of some beeches . A fine walk we have had ; bold immensely high limestone rocks above my head , grey hoary steeps , magnificent walnut trees , the favourite of the country ; Swiss figures gliding among the trees , with their deep bright baskets on their backs ; pines climbing up to the sky , fringing the rocks ; scarlet barberries glittering , and tipping the pendent boughs of the beech or walnut trees below , ” etc . etc .</p>
   <p>“ Wednesday , 9th August . Interlachen .— Our minstrel peasants passed us on the water , no longer singing plaintive ditties such as inspired the little poem , which I shall transcribe in the following page ; but with bursts of merriment they rowed lustily away . The poet has , however , transported the minstrels in their gentle mood from the Cottage door to the calm Lake . ” ( From Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal , vol . i . ) — ED .</p>

   <p>Engelberg , the Hill of Angels , as the name implies . The Convent whose site was pointed out , according to tradition , in this manner , is seated at its base . The Architecture of the Building is unimpressive , but the situation is worthy of the honour which the imagination of the Mountaineers has conferred upon it .— W . W. 1822 .</p>
   <p>“ Monday , August 14 .— At sunset we reached the edge of the flat green area , sublimely guarded ; from its head rose Engelberg ( whence the angels sang ) , Tittlesberg , [ HS ] the highest of these Alps . But between these two stood another more fantastically shaped rocky hill with a broken jagged crest , and without snow .... All around the Vale is completely enclosed by lofty barriers , piercing or supporting the clouds . From the eminence whence we first had a sight of the mists curling in the glowing sun upon the heights of Engelberg , the white convent with its own , and its lesser attendant chapels ; the pensive moving figures , in their gay attire , that as we approached saluted us ; and before we gained our harbour for the night , the convent bell calling to vespers , seemed to summon my ears to listen for the angels ’ voices from that celestial mount . All these impressions could not but excite in us thankfulness that we had been led to this Abyssinian Vale ( as D. appropriately termed it ) . ” ( Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal . )</p>
   <p>“ Monday , 14th August . Sarnen .— It was a little past seven o'clock when ( having passed round the neck of the hill , or promontory , as I may call it ) we perceived that the object of our delightful day 's journey could not be far distant . A stately mass of crag , a mountain composed of stone of a soft yellow hue irregularly piled up , and between pyramid and tower-shaped , appeared before us . It could be no other than the Hill of Engelberg , the Angel 's Hill , where , it is believed , the angels sang songs of approval , while holy men laid the foundation of the abbey . Others say that the Founders were led to choose that spot because the Rock of Engelberg was the place those happy spirits were accustomed to haunt , and that their melodies were heard while the work was going on . It is no wonder that such traditions are believed by some of the good Catholics even at this day ; for never was there on earth a more beautiful pinnacle for happy spirits than the Rock of Engelberg , as we first beheld it , gilded with the beams of the declining sun . Light clouds , as white as snow , yet melting into the thinnest substance , and tinged with heavenly light , were floating around and below its summit . We exclaimed , ‘ There you see the wings of the Angels ! ’ ——. Our recollections of that moment cannot be effaced ; and some time afterwards my Brother expressed his feelings in the following little Poem . ” ( From Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal , vol . i . ) — ED .</p>

   <p>“ August , Saturday 19th . Top of the Rigi .—... Eastern sky rich with golden streaks , clouds floating around in all directions below us : then driving eastwards , we expecting momently to be enveloped in the condensing mist , but the breezes again and again took it away , through the channel between the Rigi and the opposite mountains . At length the bright sun just showed itself , lighted up the tips of the Alps with a rosy splendour , silvered the edges of , and gave angels ’ wings to the neighbouring clouds for a moment , then shrouded himself up , and the glory faded away .... A tall cross is finely placed upon the top of this hill .... Set forward on our descent from this remarkable place . Pleasant green mountain track led us soon to the Parish Church of Rigiberg , dedicated to ‘ Our Lady of the Snow . ’ It was crammed with pictures of the Virgin and Child , in various situations , setting forth her miraculous powers , and how they had been exercised : small convent of Capuchins close by : easy and beautiful road down for some time ; high Crosses with pictures all the way ; Chapels with frightful figures , enough to terrify the Religious on their way to ‘ Our Lady of the Snow ': met several peasants before we reached the foot of the hill ; Houses for them to rest on their way : beautiful steep thin waterfalls ; lofty wooded and pine-clad crags accompanied us all the way on our descent .... ” ( From Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal . )</p>
   <p>“ Saturday , 19th August . Top of Rigi .— With hearts not less joyous than those of the young men with whom we had just parted , we began our journey . How delicious was the descent over the velvet turf , towards the Chapel of Our Lady of the Snow ! seen below within a narrow steep glen . The air still fresh and cool , we gradually find ourselves enclosed by the declivities of the glen , those rugged steeps are hung with pine trees , narrow cataracts come down the clefts in unbroken white lines — or over the facings of rock , in drops and stages . Side by side with the central rivulet , we go on still descending , though with far slower pace , and come to the Village of Rigi , and our Lady 's Chapel cradled in the slip of the dell , and , at this tranquil time , lulled by the voices of the streams . The interior of the Chapel is hung with hundreds of offerings — staffs , crutches , etc . etc ., and pictures representing marvellous escapes , with written records of vows performed — and dangers averted through the gracious protection of Our Lady of the Snow . Near the Chapel is a small religious House , where a few Monks reside , probably in attendance upon the chapel , which continues to draw together numerous worshippers from the distant Vales on days of penitence or of festival . ” ( From Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal , vol . i . ) — ED .</p>

   <p>In Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal the following occurs , under date August 21 .— “ Altorf .... Visited a Painter , who follows his Art , and instructs pupils in ‘ Tell 's Tower ': fine prospect from the Tower , and from the Church beautiful almost beyond description . The towers of Altorf , the Vale beyond , and Fluellin on the margin of the lake ; the pine-clad barriers , with here and there a fantastic marked rock , or a snowy forehead reared above all .... I have called this place a village , but I insult the capital of the canton of Uri by so doing : neither is it like a village . A small Town , with stately houses , Fountains — Tell 's Fountain , Church , a large Painted Tower , that gives Tell 's story , is built upon the very spot where the famous Tree grew . The tree is there represented , and under it the pretty little boy with the apple upon his head .... ”</p>
   <p>“ Monday , 20th August . Altorf .— We found our own comfortable Inn , THE OX , near the fountain of William Tell . The buildings here are fortunately disposed with a pleasing irregularity . Opposite to our Inn stands the Tower of the Arsenal , built upon the spot where grew the Linden-tree to which Tell 's son is reported to have been bound when the arrow was shot . This Tower was spared by the fire which consumed an adjoining building , happily spared , if only for the sake of the rude paintings on its walls . I studied them with infinite satisfaction , especially the face of the innocent little Boy with the apple on his head . After dinner we walked up the valley to the reputed birthplace of Tell : it is a small village at the foot of a glen , rich , yet very wild . A rude unroofed modern bridge crosses the boisterous river , and , beside the bridge is a fantastic mill-race , constructed in the same rustic style — uncramped by apprehensions of committing waste upon the woods . At the top of a steep rising directly from the river , stands a square tower of grey stone , partly covered with ivy , in itself rather a striking object from the bridge , even if not pointed out for notice as being built on the site of the dwelling where William Tell was born . Near it , upon the same eminence , stands the white church , and a small chapel called by Tell 's name , where we again found rough paintings of his exploits , mixed with symbols of the Roman Catholic faith . Our walk from Altorf to this romantic spot had been stifling ; along a narrow road between old stone walls — nothing to be seen above them but the tops of fruit trees , and the imprisoning hills . No doubt when those walls were built , the lands belonged to the churches and monasteries . Happy were we when we came to the glen and rushing river , and still happier when , having clomb the eminence , we sate beside the churchyard , where kindly breezes visited us — the warm breezes of Italy ! We had here a Volunteer guide , a ragged child , voluble with his story , trimmed up for the stranger . He could tell the history of the Hero of Uri , and declare the import of each memorial ;— while ( not neglecting the saints ) he proudly pointed out to our notice ( what indeed could not have escaped it ) a gigantic daubing of the figure of St. Christopher on the wall of the church steeple . But our smart young maiden was to introduce us to the interior of the ivied Tower , so romantic in its situation above the roaring stream , at the mouth of the glen , which , behind , is buried beneath overhanging woods . We ascended to the upper rooms by a blind staircase , that might have belonged to a turret of one of our ancient castles , which conducted us into a gothic room , where we found neither the ghost nor the armour of William Tell ; but an artist at work with the pencil ; with two or three young men , his pupils , from Altorf — no better introduction to the favour of one of those young men was required than that of our sprightly female attendant . From this little academy of the arts , drawings are dispersed , probably , to every country of the continent of Europe . ” ( From Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal , vol . ii . ) — ED .</p>

   <p>“ Seewen , Sunday , 20th August .—... Wm . and I walked the direct way to Brunnen ; the rest , viz . Mr. R ., T. M ., and Dorothy , by way of Schwytz . Our course lay along the brook that runs through , and I believe gives its name to the village of Seewen ; that by Schwytz forms two sides of the triangle , and carried them considerably above us on our left . We had a fine view all the way of the town of Schwytz , which is beautifully situated , and looked stately under its protecting screen of mountains , green and woody to the very top . They bend around and tower above it ; one rising higher than the rest , in the very centre of the crescent , and directly above the church spire , has a fine effect . I was sorry to pass without going into this important tower , which gives its name to the delightful country of which it is the capital , and its station is well worthy of that honour . The pastoral sylvan character of Switzerland is happily exemplified here , and the mountains and lakes lead you gently into the more solemn and awful scenes . Our path led us through soft verdant meadows , where we met and were overtaken by the peasants with their books and nosegays in their hands .... ” ( From Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal . )</p>
   <p>“ Sunday , 20th August . Sieven .—... If Berne , with its spacious survey of Alps , and widely-spreading Vales , and magnificent River , may be called the head , this Town [ Schwytz ] , intrenched among mountains , may be called the heart of Switzerland ; to which the Canton is worthy of giving its name . Of records or curiosities that may be shut up from view , I know nothing ; but in our half hour 's sauntering through the town , we were in a state of perpetual excitement — not that there is anything beautiful , or even picturesque , in the Buildings , but altogether something romantic — with gaiety ....</p>
   <p>“ Our way was down the Vale , toward the Lake Waldstädte , [ HY ] nearly at right angles to that by which we had come to Schwytz . We asked who were the owners of a handsome large house , on our right hand , and were told a Family of the name of Reding . There was no one to tell us whether it was the Birth-place , or had been the residence of Aloys Reding ; but have since had the satisfaction of learning from my Friend , Mr. Rogers , that it was , and that he had seen him there : but I will copy Mr. R .' s own words from a letter written by him to me some years ago . [ HZ ]</p>
   <p>“ ‘ When at Schwytz in 1802 , we paid him a visit , and at the gate were surprised by a little girl coming from school , who first took my hand , and then my sister 's — leading her upstairs , and supporting her by the elbow , into a large old-fashioned room , where we found him drinking coffee with his Family , after dinner , the clock striking two . There was a noble simplicity in his manners , and a courtesy , a cordiality in the reception they all gave us that sent us away enchanted . ’</p>
   <p>“ Leaving the high-road , we turned along one of those pretty paths that look as if they were only made for going to Church , and for Fetes and Festivals . Numerous were the companies who passed , or followed us on this path , through spacious , level , and mostly verdant fields — mountains on all sides , with craggy summits . Behind us was the Town of Schwytz at the foot of the forest steep , overtopped by the two naked Pikes ; and to our left what sublime dark clefts ! ” ( From Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal , vol . i . ) — ED .</p>

   <p>“ Thursday , Aug . 24 .—... On the banks of the infant Ticino , which has its source in the pools above , within a few hundred yards of that which gives birth to the Reuss , D. and I resolved to reject all political boundaries , and thenceforth consider ourselves in Italy . With the pure stream we descended ; but first were joined by Mr. R ., J. M ., and Wm ., with a young German , whom Mr. R. had picked up in the morning ; a Heidelberg student , travelling on foot to Rome . He sang and played to us upon the flute , airs from Rossini , the Swiss Cow Song , etc . Then on we went , wending our way over the grass between the paved road and the brook wherever we could . The Brook dashing down its stony channel , now over rocks , now under shelving snow , and its banks seen clothed with underwood and pines . Passed by its first wooden bridge , leading to the cottages , not unmindful of our own Duddon ; and presently did it grace such an assemblage of rocks , dells , and woods , forming waterfalls , pools , and all the various charms that a mountain stream can show . ” ( Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal . )</p>
   <p>“ Thursday , 23rd August . Hopital .— I found Mary sitting on the lowest of a long flight of steps . She had lost her companions ( my Brother and a young Swiss who had joined us on the road ) . We mounted the steps , and , from within , their voices answered our call . Went along a dark , stone , banditti passage , into a small chamber little less gloomy , where we found them seated with food before them , bread and cheese , with sour red wine — no milk . Hunger satisfied , Mary and I hastened to warm ourselves in the sunshine ; for the house was as cold as a dungeon . We straightway greeted with joy the infant TICINO which has its sources in the pools above . The gentlemen joined us , and we placed ourselves on a sunny bank , looking towards Italy ; and the Swiss took out his flute , and played , and afterwards sang , the Ranz des Vaches , and other airs of his country . We , and especially our sociable friend R. ( with his inexhaustible stock of kindness , and his German tongue ) found him a pleasant companion . He was from the University of Heidelberg , and bound for Rome , on a visit to a Brother , in the holidays ; and , our mode of travelling , for a short way , being the same , it was agreed we should go on together : but before we reached Airola he left us , and we saw no more of him . ” ( From Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal , vol . ii . ) — ED .</p>

    <head>FORT FUENTES<span corresp="#note516" type="note_anchor">[ 516 ]</span></head>
    <head>The Ruins of Fort Fuentes form the crest of a rocky eminence that rises from the plain at the head of the Lake of Como , commanding views up the Valteline , and toward the town of Chiavenna . The prospect in the latter direction is characterised by melancholy sublimity . We rejoiced at being favoured with a distinct view of those Alpine heights ; not , as we had expected from the breaking up of the storm , steeped in celestial glory , yet in communion with clouds floating or stationary — scatterings from heaven . The Ruin is interesting both in mass and in detail . An Inscription , upon elaborately-sculptured marble lying on the ground , records that the Fort had been erected by Count Fuentes in the year 1600 , during the reign of Philip the Third ; and the Chapel , about twenty years after , by one of his Descendants . Marble pillars of gateways are yet standing , and a considerable part of the Chapel walls : a smooth green turf has taken place of the pavement , and we could see no trace of altar or image ; but every where something to remind one of former splendour , and of devastation and tumult . In our ascent we had passed abundance of wild vines intermingled with bushes : near the ruins were some ill tended , but growing willingly ; and rock , turf , and fragments of the pile , are alike covered or adorned with a variety of flowers , among which the rose-coloured pink was growing in great beauty . While descending , we discovered on the ground , apart from the path , and at a considerable distance from the ruined Chapel , a statue of a Child in pure white marble , uninjured by the explosion that had driven it so far down the hill . “ How little , ” we exclaimed , “ are these things valued here ! Could we but transport this pretty Image to our own garden ! ” — Yet it seemed it would have been a pity any one should remove it from its couch in the wilderness , which may be its own for hundreds of years .

   <p>“ Wed ., Sept . 6 .—... Crossed the plain of Colico to FUENTES , a ruined Fort on the summit of a group of Rocks , abruptly rising from the plain , and overlooking the head of the Lake towards Chiavenna ; up the nearer and larger valley , whence comes the Adda , a river bearing the same name as that which flows out of the Lake at Lecco ; and into the clefts and recesses among the savage Rocks ; over the plain ; upon the Lake . Wm . had gone on before D. and myself , and had gained the top of this picturesque eminence , by a rough and difficult way . We had determined to be satisfied with what we had seen below , when two civil peasants joined us , and kindly led us by an easy path to Wm . on the summit . He pointed out to us where he had been lost , and separated from Jones ; we were enchanted by the mountain scenery . The whole spot excited the deepest interest ; and , from the very point where we were , this rocky station , with its ruined fort , church , dwellings , all desolated by those barbarians the French , it was very affecting to see vines — which no doubt had heretofore been carefully supported by trellises upon these terraces — now running wild , and gadding about among the underwood that clothed the banks . Lumps and masses of marble — architectural ravages — strewn about . Apart from the path , and at a considerable distance from the grassy glade where the church had stood , lay the beautiful statue of a Child , in pure white marble . It seemed strange that this had not been removed ; yet scarcely less strange than that , among the grass should be left an inscription upon marble , together with richly carved ornaments , expressing that the Fort had been erected by a Spanish Count Fuentes , in the time of Philip the third .... ” ( Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal . )</p>
   <p>“ Wednesday , 5th September . Cadenabbia .— Bent our course toward Fuentes — and after a wearisome walk through damp and breathless heat ( a full league or more ) over a perfect level , we reached the foot of the eminence , which from the lake had appeared to be at a small distance , but it seemed to have retreated as we advanced . We had left the high road , and trudged over the swampy plain , through which the road must have been made with great expense and labour , as it is raised considerably all the way . The picturesque ruins of the Castle of Fuentes are at the top of the eminence — wild vines , the bramble and the clematis cling to the bushes ; and beautiful flowers grow in the chinks of the rocks , and on every bed of grass . A tempting though rugged ascent — yet ( with the towers in sight above our heads , and two-thirds of the labour accomplished ) Mary and I ( Wm . having gone before to discover the nearest and least difficult way for us ) sate down determined not to go a step further . We had a grand prospect ; and , being exhausted by the damp heat , were willing for once to leave our final object unattained . However , while seated on the ground , two stout hard-laboured peasants chancing to come close to us on the path , invited us forward , and we could not resist — they led the way — two rough creatures .</p>
   <p>“ I said to Mary when we were climbing up among the rocks and bushes in that wild and lonely place , ‘ What , you have no fear of trusting yourself to a pair of Italian Banditti ? ’ I knew not their occupation , but an accurate description of their persons would have fitted a novel-writer with ready-made attendants for a tribe of robbers — good-natured and kind , however they were , nay , even polite in their rustic way as others tutored to city civility . Cultivated vines grew upon the top of the hill ; and they took pains to pluck for us the ripest grapes . We now had a complete view up the great vale of the Adda , to which , the road that we had left conducts the Traveller . Below us , on the other side , lay a wide green marshy plain , between the hill of Fuentes and the shores of the lake ; which plain , spreading upwards , divides the lake ; the upper small reach being called Chiavenna . The path which my Brother had travelled , when bewildered in the night thirty years ago , was traceable through some parts of the forest on the opposite side :— and the very passage through which he had gone down to the shore of the lake — then most dismal with thunder , lightning , and rain . I hardly can conceive a place of more solitary aspect than the lake of Chiavenna : and the whole of the prospect on that direction is characterized by melancholy sublimity . We rejoiced , after our toil , at being favoured with a distinct view of those sublime heights , not , it is true , steeped in celestial hues of sunny glory , yet in communion with clouds , floating or stationary :— scatterings from heaven . The Ruin itself is very interesting , both in the mass and in detail — an inscription is lying on the ground which records that the Castle was built by the Count of Fuentes in the year 1600 , and the Chapel about twenty years after by one of his descendants . Some of the gateways are yet standing with their marble pillars , and a considerable part of the walls of the Chapel . A smooth green turf has taken the place of the pavement ; and we could see no trace of altar or sacred image , but everywhere something to remind one of former grandeur and of destruction and tumult , while there was , in contrast with the imaginations so excited , a melancholy pleasure in contemplating the wild quietness of the present day . The vines , near the ruin , though ill tended , grow willingly , and rock , turf , and fragments of the stately pile are alike covered or adorned with a variety of flowers , among which the rose-coloured pink was in great beauty . In our descent we found a fair white cherub , uninjured by the explosion which had driven it a great way down the hill . It lay bedded like an infant in its cradle among low green bushes .— W . said to us , ‘ Could we but carry this pretty Image to our moss summer-house at Rydal Mount ! ’ yet it seemed as if it would have been a pity that any one should remove it from its couch in the wilderness , which may be its own for hundreds of years . ” ( From Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal , vol . ii . )</p>
   <p>The “ Extract from Journal , ” which Wordsworth prefixed to this poem in the edition of 1827 and subsequent ones , is , it will be observed , not an exact transcription from either of the two Journals written by his wife and his sister . It is a compilation from both of them ; and , as it was doubtless written by himself , it may illustrate the wish , expressed in the Fenwick note to the poem Between Namur and Liege , that “ some one would put together the notices contained in these Journals ,... bringing the whole into a small compass , ” etc . Most readers will be of opinion , however , that something has been lost by the condensation , and that the poet 's note of 1827 does not render the publication of the longer extracts from the two Journals superfluous . Another instance of Wordsworth 's use of the materials of these Journals , while rewriting the extract , will be found in the note to the poem Brugès .— ED .</p>

    <head>This Church was almost destroyed by lightning a few years ago , but the Altar and the Image of the Patron Saint were untouched . The Mount , upon the summit of which the Church is built , stands in the midst of the intricacies of the Lake of Lugano ; and is , from a hundred points of view , its principal ornament , rising to the height of 2000 feet , and , on one side , nearly perpendicular . The ascent is toilsome ; but the Traveller who performs it will be amply rewarded . Splendid fertility , rich woods and dazzling waters , seclusion and confinement of view contrasted with sea-like extent of plain fading into the sky ; and this again , in an opposite quarter , with an horizon of the loftiest and boldest Alps — unite in composing a prospect more diversified by magnificence , beauty , and sublimity , than perhaps any other point in Europe , of so inconsiderable an elevation , commands .— W.

   <p>“ Monday , 28th Aug . Lugano .— At half-past four o'clock , wishing it had been earlier , we started to see the sun rise from the top of San Salvador ; found , at that dewy hour , the Peasants busy in their vineyards , as we passed in our ascent . Wm . and T. M . reached the top in an hour and twenty minutes . Mr. R. kindly lingered with us . We ascended in about two hours , and much were we delighted . The Alps how glorious ! The Rosa ! the Simplon ! and ( as the guide told us ) Mont Blanc ! and I believe he was right . However , Mont Blanc , nor no other mount , could surpass the exquisite appearance of what belonged to earth , gleaming high up in the skies . This was the glory of our view — the majesty lay to the left of these . There , by the naked eye , we saw the River Po , drawn out in silver line , along the horizon ; and , with the telescope , towns and villages gleaming on its banks . Mountains , glens , and plains , the lake spreading at our feet this way and that , cutting off the portion of land upon which this favoured and favouring hill rises . A church and house upon the summit . Three years ago the sacred edifice was struck by lightning , and every part of it destroyed or greatly injured , except the altar . The holy place , containing the image of San Salvador , was left untouched . In that lofty chapel , now under repair , service is performed four times a year ; and at these festivals the same merriment goes forward upon the mountain as in the villages and towns upon like occasions . Offerings are then brought to the patron saint .... We returned highly delighted with this adventure , for which we are indebted to Mr. R .' s Book , that determined us to climb San Salvador , one of the grandest feats we have accomplished . ” ( Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal . )</p>
   <p>“ Sunday , 26th August . Locarno .— We had resolved to ascend St. Salvador before sunrise ; and , a contrary wind having sprung up , the Boatmen wished to persuade us to stay all night at a town upon a low point of land pushed far into the Lake , which conceals from our view that portion of it , where , at the head of a large basin or bay , stands the town of Lugano . They told us we might thence ascend the mountain with more ease than from Lugano , a wile to induce us to stay ; but we called upon them to push on . Having weathered this point , and left it some way behind , the place of our destination appears in view — ( like Locarno and Luvino ) within the semicircle of a bay — a wide basin of waters spread before it ; and the reach of the lake towards Porlezza winding away to our right . That reach appeared to be of more grave and solemn character than any we had passed through — grey steeps enclosing it on each side . We now coasted beneath bare precipices at the foot of St. Salvador — shouted to the echoes — and were answered by travellers from the Road far above our heads . Thence tended towards the middle of the basin ; and the town of Lugano appeared in front of us , low green woody hills rising above it . Mild lightning fluttered like the northern lights over the steeps of St. Salvador , yet without threatening clouds ; the wind had fallen ; and no apprehensions of a storm disturbed our pleasures . It was eight o'clock when we reached the inn , where all things were on a large scale-splendid yet shabby . ”</p>
   <p>“ Monday , 27th August . Lugano .— Roused from sleep at a quarter before four o'clock , the moon brightly shining . At a quarter past four set off on foot to ascend Mount St. Salvador . Though so early , people were stirring in the streets ; our walk was by the shore , round the fine bay — solemn yet cheerful in the morning twilight . At the beginning of the ascent , passed through gateways and sheds among picturesque old buildings with overhanging flat roofs — vines hanging from the walls , with the wildness of brambles or the untrained woodbine . The ascent from the beginning is exceedingly steep and without intermission to the very summit . Vines spreading from tree to tree , resting upon walls , or clinging to wooden poles , they creep up the steep sides of the hill , no boundary line between them and the wild growth of the mountain , with which , at last , they are blended till no trace of cultivation appears . The road is narrow ; but a path to the shrine of St. Salvador has been made with great pains , still trodden once in the year by crowds ( probably , at this day , chiefly of peasantry ) to keep the Festival of that Saint on the summit of the mount . It winds along the declivities of the rocks — and , all the way , the views are beautiful . To begin with , looking backward to the town of Lugano , surrounded by villas among trees — a rich vale beyond the Town , an ample tract bright with cultivation and fertility , scattered over with villages and spires — who could help pausing to look back on these enchanting scenes ? Yet a still more interesting spectacle travels with us , at our side ( but how far beneath us ! ) the Lake , winding at the base of the mountain , into which we looked from craggy forest precipices , apparently almost as steep as the walls of a castle , and a thousand times higher . We were bent on getting start of the rising sun , therefore none of the party rested longer than was sufficient to recover breath . I did so frequently , for a few minutes ; it being my plan at all times to climb up with my best speed for the sake of those rests , whereas Mary , I believe , never once sate down this morning , perseveringly mounting upward . Meanwhile , many a beautiful flower was plucked among the mossy stones . One , [ IC ] in particular , there was ( since found wherever we have been in Italy ) . I helped Miss Barker to plant that same flower in her garden brought from Mr. Clarke 's hot-house . In spite of all our efforts the sun was beforehand with us . We were two hours in ascending . W. and Mr. R. who had pushed on before , were one hour and forty minutes . When we stood on the crown of that glorious Mount , we seemed to have attained a spot which commanded pleasures equal to all that sight could give on this terrestrial world . We beheld the mountains of Simplon — two brilliant shapes on a throne of clouds — Mont Blanc ( as the guide told us [ ID ]) lifting his resplendent forehead above a vapoury sea — and the Monte Rosa , a bright pyramid , how high up in the sky ! The vision did not burst upon us suddenly ; but was revealed by slow degrees , while we felt so satisfied and delighted with what lay distinctly outspread around us , that we had hardly begun to look for objects less defined , in the far-distant horizon . I cannot describe the green hollows , hills , slopes , and woody plains — the towns , villages , and towers — the crowds of secondary mountains , substantial in form and outline , bounding the prospect in other quarters — nor the bewitching loveliness of the lake of Lugano lying at the base of Mount Salvador , and thence stretching out its arms between the bold steeps . My brother said he had never in his life seen so extensive a prospect at the expense only of two hours ’ climbing : but it must be remembered that the whole of the ascent is almost a precipice . Beyond the town of Lugano , the hills and wide vale are thickly sprinkled with towns and houses . Small lakes ( to us their names unknown ) were glittering among the woody steeps , and beneath lay the broad neck of the Peninsula of St. Salvador — a tract of hill and valley , woods and waters . Far in the distance on the other side , the towers of Milan might be descried . The river Po , a ghostly serpent-line , rested on the brown plains of Lombardy ; and there again we traced the Ticino , departed from his mountain solitudes , where we had been his happy companions .</p>
   <p>“ But I have yet only looked beyond the mount . There is a house beside the Chapel , probably in former times inhabited by persons devoted to religious services — or it might be only destined for the same use for which it serves at present , a shelter for them who flock from the vallies to the yearly Festival . Repairs are going on in the Chapel , which was struck by lightning a few years ago , and all but the altar and its holy things , with the image of the patron saint , destroyed . Their preservation is an established miracle , and the surrounding peasantry consider the memorials as sanctified anew by that visitation from heaven . ” ( From Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal , vol . ii . ) See note to stanzas Composed in one of the Catholic Cantons , p . 313 .— ED .</p>

   <p>Dorothy Wordsworth gives the following fuller account of the same person . “ Thursday , 6th September . Cadenabbia .— After a night of heavy rain , a bright morning . W ., M ., and I set off toward Menaggio along the terrace bordering the water , which led us to the bay at the foot of the rocky green hill of the Church of our Lady ; and there we came upon the track of the old road , the very same which my Brother had paced ! for there was no other , nor the possibility of one . That track , continued from the foot of the mountain , leads behind the town of Cadenabbia , cutting off the bending of the shore by which we had come to this point . From the bare precipice , we pass through shade and sunshine , among spreading vines , slips of green turf , or gardens of melons , gourds , maize , and fig-trees among the rocks ; it was but for a little space , yet enough to make our regret even more lively than before that it had not been in our power to coast one reach at least of the lake on foot . We had been overtaken by a fine tall man , who somewhat proudly addressed us in English . After twenty years ’ traffic in our country he had been settled near his native place on the Banks of Como , having purchased an estate near Cadenabbia with the large sum of two thousand pounds , acquired by selling barometers , looking-glasses , etc . He had been used to return to his wife every third year in the month of October . He made preparations during the winter for fresh travels in the spring , at the same time working with her on the small portion of land which they then possessed . Portsmouth and Plymouth were the grand marts for his wares . He amused us with recitals of adventures among the sailors who used to bully him with , ‘ Come , you rogue , you get your money easily enough ; spend it freely ! ’ and he did not care if he got rid of a guinea or two ; for he was sure to have it back again after one of the frolics — and much more . They would often clear away his whole stock of nick-nacks . This industrious trader used to travel on foot at the rate of from thirty to forty miles a day , and his expenses from London to Como were but three guineas , though it cost him one third of that sum to get to Calais . He said he liked England because the people were honest , and told us some stories illustrative of English honesty and Italian over-reaching in bargains . This amusing and , I must say , interesting companion , turned from us by a side-path before we reached Menaggio , saying he would meet us again , as our road would lead us near his cottage on the heights , and he should see us from the fields . He had another dwelling on his estate beside Cadenabbia , where the land produced excellent wine . The produce of his farm on the hills was chiefly hay , which they were then gathering in . ”</p>
   <p>The Swiss Goatherd was a boy met by the travellers at Brunnen . Mrs. Wordsworth thus wrote of him in her Journal :— “ 20th Aug .—... Mountains rising through vapour into the sky in front , and looking back , the two Mythen towering in great majesty . The Peasants , inhabitants of these paradisaical retreats , very civil , and seemed gratified by our eagerness in quest of the interests they live among . Young men , seated in one of these spacious sheds , making merry after having ended their diversions . The target seen everywhere . In one of the sheds as we ascended , found four goats chewing the cud , a little boy attending , all on the bench . He looked so pensive that we became much interested about him , but D. could not make him understand a single word . William gave him 1 / 2 a ——; for which unexpected and unsolicited gift the boy thanked him ‘ a hundred thousand times . ’ I afterwards gave him a second piece , and the same expression of thanks was repeated . The longer we looked at the subdued countenance of this little Boy , the more we felt for his solitary condition . Here , with those four mute companions , he had passed his day . The beauty of the scenery he was among was nothing to him ; and no doubt he knew of and had heard the sound of the merriment in the vales below . When we repassed the shed , it was empty . ” ( Journal , vol . ii . )</p>
   <p>In Dorothy Wordsworth 's briefer record of the same incident , the following occurs :— “ In one of these [ sheds ] we found four goats ( how bright in the cool shade ) beside their keeper , then sitting on the bench , an elegant-featured Boy — dark like an Italian , ragged , silent , pensive , and timid . We gave him a few rapps , still he was silent ; then a few more , and he pronounced in German four words intelligible to English ears , ‘ a hundred thousand thanks ’ ; but his pale cheek wanted the ready smile of the beggar 's . It seemed as if none of his pleasures were social , except what he might have with his dumb companions . ” ( Journal , vol . ii . )</p>

   <p>This picture of the Last Supper has not only been grievously injured by time , but the greatest part of it , if not the whole , is said to have been retouched , or painted over again . These niceties may be left to connoisseurs ,— I speak of it as I felt . The copy exhibited in London some years ago , and the engraving by Merghen , are both admirable ; but in the original is a power which neither of those works has attained , or even approached .— W . W. 1837 .</p>
   <p>“ Sunday , Sept. 3 . Milan .—... Thence we went again to the Cathedral , and to I know not how many different churches : St. Ambrose , very old and interesting , fine frescoes . St. Maria della Grazia , where , in the Refectory , is the exquisite picture of Leonardo da Vinci ; but how grievous that it should have been so injured by the brutality of the French soldiers ; yet , in its state of decay , what a Treasure ! and how little everything that we have seen of Pictures is to be compared to the truth , the chasteness , and the composure that you see , and not only see , but feel , when seated before that sublime work of human art . The countenance of our Saviour sinks into your soul . Happily this is uninjured , as are also the heads of several of the Apostles , but some are quite extinguished . ” ( From Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal . )</p>
   <p>“ Sunday , 2nd September . Milan .— Went also to the convent of Maria della Grazia to view that most famous picture of the Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci , painted on the wall at one end of the refectory , a very large hall , hung along the sides with smaller pictures , and , at the other end , that painting of the crucifixion of which we had seen a copy at Lugano . This Refectory was used , in the days of Buonaparte , as a military store-house , and the mark of a musket ball , fired in wantonness by a French Soldier , is to be seen in one part of the painting of Leonardo da Vinci . Fortunately the ball hit where the injury was as small as it could have been ; and it is only marvellous that this fine work was not wholly defaced during those times of military misrule and utter disregard of all sacred things . [ II ] Little conversant in pictures , I cannot take upon me to describe this , which impressed my feelings and imagination more than any picture I ever saw , though some of the figures are so injured by damp that they are only just traceable . The most important are , however , happily the least injured ; and that of our Saviour has only suffered from a general fading in the colours , yet , alas ! the fading and vanishing must go on year after year till , at length , the whole group must pass away . Through the cloisters of the monastery , which are shattered and defaced , pictures are found in all parts , and there are some curious monuments . ” ( From Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal , vol . ii . ) — ED .</p>

   <p>The Statues ranged round the Spire and along the roof of the Cathedral of Milan , have been found fault with by Persons whose exclusive taste is unfortunate for themselves . It is true that the same expense and labour judiciously directed to purposes more strictly architectural , might have much heightened the general effect of the building ; for , seen from the ground , the Statues appear diminutive . But the coup-d'œil , from the best point of view , which is half way up the Spire , must strike an unprejudiced Person with admiration ; and surely the selection and arrangement of the Figures is exquisitely fitted to support the religion of the Country in the imaginations and feelings of the Spectator . It was with great pleasure that I saw , during the two ascents which we made , several Children , of different ages , tripping up and down the slender spire , and pausing to look around them , with feelings much more animated than could have been derived from these , or the finest works of art , if placed within easy reach .— Remember also that you have the Alps on one side , and on the other the Apennines , with the Plain of Lombardy between !— W . W. 1822 .</p>
   <p>The starry zone of sovereign height .</p>
   <p>Above the highest circle of figures is a zone of metallic stars .— W . W. 1837 .</p>
   <p>“ Thursday , Sept. 7 . Cadenabbia .—... Nothing could be more lovely than the milder scenes this morning : the little lake Piano : the sunny glades , enlivened by groups of Peasants , gathering in their various harvests , or seated under the shade of some tree taking refreshment , their simple breakfast , a piece of bread and a little fruit ; then , the shadows of these trees upon green emerald lawns , between the little lake and that of Lugano , lay more softly than ever shadows rested before , cradled under those stupendous perpendicular barriers . Took boat at Porlezza . Eclipse of the Sun : could bear to look at the orb shorn of his beams , with the naked eye : the effect produced upon the scenery very fine , such a sombre greenness , like the effect of bright moonlight : only under a bright moon that very green colour generally diffused ( as if you had on a pair of green spectacles ) cannot be . On the right bank of the lake the woods were of a rich golden green , gloomy on the left shore , and looking back among the towering rocks , and black coves , the region was very solemn . The water , unillumined by sunshine , was of what I should call a sad green : the air cooler , indeed a coolish air gently agitated the lake , while the eclipse lasted . We congratulated ourselves in being undesignedly , and indeed unexpectedly , in so grand a situation to witness this phenomenon . ” ( Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal . )</p>
   <p>As reference is made in the poem to “ Milan 's loftiest spire , ” and its “ Figures human and divine , ” the following extracts from the two Journals may be given in illustration :— “ Sept. 2 . Milan . ” — “ The cathedral we have thoroughly seen this morning . It is a grand and imposing Edifice — we have been delighted both with the building , and with the material especially , all marble of the finest kind . 3000 statues of beautiful polished white marble are stationed upon this elegant Pile . We were upon the very top ; the pinnacle so light , yet notwithstanding the height , and its slender appearance , feeling yourself perfectly secure .... The view of the Cathedral itself from this station is extraordinary ; the pure graceful figures , streaming far before you , have a most interesting and curious effect ; and , from the lower roofs also , you have many fine combinations . ” ( Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal . )</p>
   <p>“ Saturday , 1st September . Milan .— Our object this morning was to ascend to the roof , where I remained alone , not venturing to follow the rest of the party to the top of the giddy , central spire , which is ascended by a narrow staircase twisted round the outside . Even W. was obliged to trust to a hand governed by a steadier head than his own . I wandered about , with space spread around me ( on the roof on which I trod ) , for streets and even squares of no very diminutive Town . The floor on which I trod was all of polished marble , intensely hot , and as dazzling as snow ; and instead of moving figures I was surrounded by groups and stationary processions of silent statues — saints , sages , and angels . It is impossible for me to describe the beautiful spectacle , or to give a notion of the delight I felt ; therefore I will copy a sketch in verse composed from my Brother 's recollections of the view from the central Spire . ” ( From Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal , vol . ii . )</p>
   <p>Henry Crabb Robinson wrote thus of these memorial stanzas :— “ Of the stanzas , I love most — loving all — ‘ The Eclipse of the Sun . ’ ” ( Diary , etc ., vol . ii . p . 224 . ) — ED .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>“ Lugano , Sept. 8 , Friday .—... The evening was uncommonly fine ; the road shady ; bells ringing from the neighbouring chapels , that crested many a steep rock ; birds too here , fitfully warbling from the groves ; waters gushing through some rocky cleft among the thickets ; and I , at my own pace and will , enjoyed a quiet and most refreshing walk . At every step up and down the well-made road , meeting something new , a different shaped mountain , or the same trees under different combinations , a tempting path winding to a village in a dell below , or to a nest of cottages gathered round a spire above , a tinkling stream , or a green glade without one ; and all the way through a region of stately trees .... Here an elegant-looking peasant Girl was putting on her gay ornaments before she entered the Town , where also was a festival . Her dress was so pretty I could not help noticing it , a scarlet chintz frock with a deep figured border , a wide muslin apron , nearly wrapping her round , also with a deep richly wrought border , and slung by white straps over the shoulders , a gold chain round the neck , earrings , etc . ; her hair , something like Dora 's , nicely braided . Her companions were assisting to put a very beautiful silk handkerchief upon her neck . One of them , from the interest she seemed to take in the arrangements , might be the mother of the Maiden ; the other , a younger Sister perhaps , who lent her aid more slackly , and would , I daresay , rather have been in the wild fields gathering flowers to deck a Mayday garland , or to wreath a coronal for Our Lady 's head , on this her day of Festival . ”</p>
   <p>The intrepid Nymph , on Uri 's steep , descried !</p>
   <p>is thus referred to by Mrs. Wordsworth :—</p>
   <p>“ Sunday , 20th Aug . Seewen .—... William and I returned later than the rest , having gone further . On reaching a knoll , before we descended into Brunnen , a pretty short-faced , bright-eyed Girl of eighteen or nineteen met us . We enquired the way . She answered ; and we bid her good night , and turned from her . Presently she whistled very softly , then sent forth an uncouth sound , more as from the voice of a man than a maiden . It was not a deep sound , but one that might be heard in the Vale and across the Lake , and made the hills about us ring . This was followed by a series of Swiss airs , which she warbled without pause , one after the other , in an impassioned manner , hurrying through as if she wished to reach the utmost limits of her powers , before we were out of hearing ; yet I cannot but think these modulated notes meant more than we could understand . They were probably addressed to some one at a distance . There she stood upon the naked rock ; and , as a waterfall , the sound grew as we listened , so that I even fancied she was following us , in sight of the villages below and around , and her voice must have been known to those nearer dwellings , in one of which she probably found her home . ”</p>

     <l n="1">The “ Sweet Highland Girl ! ” is thus described in Dorothy Wordsworth 's</l>
     <l n="2">Recollections of a Tour made in Scotland in 1803 :—</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Sunday , Aug. 28 , 1803 .— After long waiting , the girls , who had been on the look-out , informed us that the boat was coming . I went to the waterside , and saw a cluster of people on the opposite shore ; but being yet at a distance , they looked more like soldiers surrounding a carriage than a group of men and women ; red and green were the distinguishable colours . We hastened to get ourselves ready as soon as we saw the party approach , but had longer to wait than we expected , the lake being wider than it appears to be . As they drew near we could distinguish men in tartan plaids , women in scarlet cloaks , and green umbrellas by the half-dozen . The landing was as pretty a sight as ever I saw . The bay , which had been so quiet two days before , was all in motion with small waves , while the swollen waterfall roared in our ears . The boat came steadily up , being pressed almost to the water 's edge by the weight of its cargo ; perhaps twenty people landed , one after another . It did not rain much , but the women held up their umbrellas ; they were dressed in all the colours of the rainbow , and , with their scarlet cardinals , the tartan plaids of the men , and Scotch bonnets , made a gay appearance . There was a joyous bustle surrounding the boat , which even imparted something of the same character to the waterfall in its tumult , and the restless grey waves ; the young men laughed and shouted , the lasses laughed , and the elder folks seemed to be in a bustle to be away . I remember well with what haste the mistress of the house where we were ran up to seek after her child , and seeing us , how anxiously and kindly she inquired how we had fared , if we had had a good fire , had been well waited upon , etc . etc . All this in three minutes — for the boatman had another party to bring from the other side , and hurried us off .</p>
   <p>“ The hospitality we had met with at the two cottages and Mr. Macfarlane 's gave us very favourable impressions on this our first entrance into the Highlands , and at this day the innocent merriment of the girls , with their kindness to us , and the beautiful figure and face of the elder , come to my mind whenever I think of the ferry-house and waterfall of Loch Lomond , and I never think of the two girls but the whole image of that romantic spot is before me , a living image , as it will be to my dying day . ”</p>

   <p>Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal contains the following reference to this “ column ":— “ Sat ., 9th Sept. ( From Bavana to Domo d'Ossola . ) —... The fine column — Buonaparte 's — seen to-day , arrested here by the news of his overthrow , on its way to form a part of the triumphal arch at Milan ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Sunday , 9th September . Domo d'Ossola .— At a considerable height from the river 's bed an immense column of granite lies by the wayside , as if its course had been stopped there by tidings of Napoleon 's overthrow . It was intended by him for his unfinished triumphal arch at Milan ; and I wish it may remain prostrate on the mountain for ages to come . His bitterest foe could scarcely contrive a more impressive record of disappointed vanity and ambition . The sledge upon which it has been dragged from the quarry is rotted beneath it , while the pillar remains as fresh and sparkling as if hewn but yesterday . W ., who came after us , said he had named it the ‘ weary stone , ’ in memory of that immense stone in the wilds of Peru , so called by the Indians because after 20 , 000 of them had dragged it over heights and hollows , it tumbled down a precipice , and rested immovable at the bottom , where it must forever remain . Ere long we come to the first passage through the rocks , near the River 's bed , and ‘ Road and River '[ IO ] for some time fill the bottom of the valley . We miss the bright torrents that stream down the hills bordering the Tesino ; but here is no want of variety . We are in closer neighbourhood with the crags ; hence their shapes are continually changing , and their appearance is the more commanding ; and , wherever an old building is seen , it is overspread with the hues of the natural crags , and is in form of accordant irregularity . The very road itself , however boldly it may bestride the hills or pierce the rocks , is yet the slave of nature , its windings often being governed as imperiously as those of the Vedra within the chasm of the glen . ” ( Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal . )</p>
   <p>Another extract from Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal will farther illustrate this sonnet :—</p>
   <p>Milan , Sept . 20 .—... “ Been to see the Bibliotheca Ambrosia .... Petrarch 's Virgil delighted us more than all . It had been clawed by Buonaparte ; and he had had the audacity to new-bind this book , and place four odious N 's upon its back . When he revisited this library , as the animated old librarian related to us , he had this volume under his arm , saying , ‘ This is mine , ’ and walked off with it himself . It is well it did not remain in possession of so unworthy a master . ” — ED .</p>

   <p>Wordsworth and his friends did not visit any of the places mentioned in the first two stanzas , but recrossed the Alps by the Simplon route after their brief visit to the Italian Lakes . Mrs. Wordsworth writes thus of their walk from Domo d'Ossola to the Simplon Hospice :— “ Sunday , Sept . 20 .—... We had great pleasure in discovering traces of a more difficult ascent ( in one instance , with the remains of an oratory ) , down which William and Jones came thirty years ago . William pointed out to us an ancient , high , many windowed edifice , by the roadside , as the Hospital where they had lodged ; a wild and solemn harbour ! On the opposite side of the road , a neat little church , as clean as any English chapel , standing in its tiny enclosure of burial ground ; below , the Tusa ; but its murmur , or rather raving , could not be heard for the riotous din of a torrent , tumbling from the stupendous mountain above , a tumultuous sound , distinctly remembered by William , an unchangeable object ! Bonaparte 's words , ‘ Be thou fettered , ’ would have been of no avail here .... As we advance , Pines climbing up to the skies , in some places clothing the very pinnacles of the highest rocks . The road cut and carried through masses of the solid rock .... Symptoms of desolation as we advance . Mountains crumbling gradually , or brought down by force of waters . Blasted pines standing or torn up , and lying in a decaying state , in the torrent 's bed . In the midst of such scenes to come in view of one of those lovely green Prairies is an enlivening sight , with its little cottage .... Watching as we did all the way snatches of the old road , we traced it as we thought across the river and up the ascent on the other side ; and afterwards Wm . told us that there was the very point where he and Jones had committed the same mistake , had taken that road ( as recorded in his poem ) and had to retrace their steps — and bend downwards with the stream , under a sort of depression from the feeling that ‘ he had crossed the Alps . ’ ... ”</p>

   <p>They went up the Gemmi Pass from Leukerbad , passed the Dauben See and the Schwarenbach Inn , looked into the valley of Kandersteg , and returned to the baths of Leuk . Mrs. Wordsworth writes :— “ Wed ., 13th Sept. Baths of Leuk .—... On our right we looked down from an immense height into Gastern Thal , a huge cleft , between the snowy Giants , Altels and Blumlis Alp . The Kandor rises out of this rocky recess , makes a bend at the foot of our high station , and takes a direct course down the valley before us .... We were very loath to return , without measuring the tempting vale through which this river flows . Returned by the same path . On drawing towards the little mountain Inn , the mastiff , hearing our footsteps before we could see him , or hear his voice , raised such a tumult in the mountains as produced the effect of a large pack of well-toned hounds in full cry . It was a grand sound . And this reminds me of the fine echoes called forth by a traveller or his guide in the morning . They were before us , as we clomb the Gemmi . The voice was a universal one ; and the prolonged and re-echoed notes could not have been more harmonious had they proceeded from the sweetest instrument . ”</p>
   <p>“ Wednesday , 12th September . Baths of Leuk .— The total absence of all sound of living creature was very striking : silent moths in abundance flew about in the sunshine , and the muddy Lake weltered below us ; the only sound when we checked our voices to listen . Hence we continued to journey over rocky and barren ground till we suddenly looked down into a warm , green nook , into which we must descend . Twelve cattle were there enclosed by the crags , as in a field of their own choosing . We passed among them , giving no disturbance , and again came upon a tract as barren as before . After about two leagues from the top of the Gemmi crags , the summer Chalet , our promised resting-place , was seen facing us , reared against the stony mountain , and overlooking a desolate round hollow . Winding along the side of the hill ( that deep hollow beneath us to the right ) a long half-mile brought us to the platform before the door of the hut . It was a scene of wild gaiety . Half-a-score of youthful travellers ( military students from the College of Thun ) were there regaling themselves . Mr. Robinson became sociable ; and we , while the party stood round us talking with him , had our repast spread upon the same table where they had finished theirs . They departed ; and we saw them winding away towards the Gemmi on the side of the precipice above the dreary hollow — a long procession , not less interesting than the group at our approach . But every object connected with animated nature ( and human life especially ) is interesting on such a road as this ; we meet no one with a stranger 's heart ! I cannot forget with what pleasure , soon after leaving the hut , we greeted two young matrons , one with a child in her arms , the other with hers , a lusty babe , ruddy with mountain air , asleep in its wicker cradle on her back . Thus laden they were to descend the Gemmi Rocks , and seemed to think it no hardship , returning us chearful looks while we noticed the happy burthens which they carried . Those peasant travellers out of sight , we go on over the same rocky ground , snowy pikes and craggy eminences still bounding the prospect . But ere long we approach the neighbourhood of trees , and overlooking a long smooth level covered with poor yellowish grass , saw at a distance , in the centre of the level , a group of Travellers of a different kind — a party of gentry , male and female , on mules . On meeting I spoke to the two Ladies in English , by way of trying their nation , and was pleased at being answered in the same tongue . The lawn here was prettily embayed , like a lake , among little eminences covered with dwarf trees , aged or blighted ; thence , onward to another open space , where was an encampment of cattle sheds , the large plain spotted with heaps of stones at irregular distances .... The turf was very poor , yet so lavishly overspread with close-growing flowers it reminded us of a Persian Carpet . The silver thistle , as we then named it , had a singularly beautiful effect ; a glistering star lying on the ground , as if enwrought upon it . An avalanche had covered the surface with stones many years ago , and many more will it require for nature , aided by the mountaineers ’ industry , to restore the soil to its former fertility . On approaching the destined termination of our descent , we were led among thickets of Alpine Shrubs , a rich covering of berry-bearing plants over-spreading the ground . We followed the ridge of this wildly beautiful tract , and it brought us to the brink of a precipice . On our right , when we looked into the savage valley of Gastron — upwards toward its head , and downwards to the point where the Gastron joins the Kandor , their united streams thence continuing a tumultuous course to the Lake of Thun . The head of the Kandor Thal was concealed from us , to our left , by the ridge of the hill on which we stood . By going about a mile further along the ridge to the brow of its northern extremity , we might have seen the junction of the two rivers , but were fearful of being overtaken by darkness in descending the Gemmi , and were , indeed , satisfied with the prospect already gained . The river Gastron winds in tumult over a stony channel , through the apparently level area of a grassless Vale , buried beneath stupendous mountains — not a house or hut to be seen . A roaring sound ascended to us on the eminence so high above the Vale . How awful the tumult when the River carries along with it the spring tide of melted snow ! We had long viewed in our journey a snow-covered pike , in stateliness and height surpassing all the other eminences . The whole mass of the mountain now appeared before us , on the same side of the Gastron vale on which we were . It seemed very near to us , and as if a part of its base rose from that vale . We could hardly believe our Guide when he told us that pike was one of the summits of the Jungfrau , took out maps and books , and found it could be no other mountain . I never before had a conception of the space covered by the bases of these enormous piles . After lingering as long as time would allow , we began to remeasure our steps , thankful for the privilege of again feeling ourselves in the neighbourhood of the Jungfrau , and of looking upon those heights that border the Lake of Thun , at the feet of which we had first entered among the inner windings of Switzerland . Our journey back to the Chalet was not less pleasant than in the earlier part of the day . The Guide , hurrying on before us , roused the large house-dog to give us a welcoming bark , which echoed round the mountains like the tunable voices of a full pack of hounds — a heart-stirring concert in that silent place where no waters were heard at that time — no tinkling of cattle-bells ; indeed , the barren soil offers small temptation for wandering cattle to linger there . In a few weeks our rugged path would be closed up with snow , the hut untenanted for the winter , and not a living creature left to rouse the echoes — echoes which our Bard would not suffer to die with us . ” ( From Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal , vol . ii . ) — ED .</p>

   <p>This Procession is a part of the sacramental service performed once a month . In the valley of Engelberg we had the good fortune to be present at the Grand Festival of the Virgin — but the Procession on that day , though consisting of upwards of 1000 persons , assembled from all branches of the sequestered valley , was much less striking ( notwithstanding the sublimity of the surrounding scenery ): it wanted both the simplicity of the other and the accompaniment of the Glacier-columns , whose sisterly resemblance to the moving Figures gave it a most beautiful and solemn peculiarity .— W . W. 1837 .</p>
   <p>“ Sunday , Sept. 17 . Chamouny .—... As we passed one of the little clustering villages in the Vale of Chamouny , standing at the foot of one of the five glaciers ( the Argentière I believe ) , its pretty white Church at that moment was encircled by a most interesting procession — bare-headed men first carried the symbols or banners , who were followed by a train of females : two and two winding round the building ; white garments thrown over their heads and covering their shoulders , like so many nuns ; but in that romantic place , the situation of the Church , and the costume so peculiar , it was quite impossible not to connect the moving belt of white pyramids with the snowy ones immediately above them . We were afterwards told by a young priest , as we passed along the green meadows of Orsina , whither he was going to do duty , and with whom D. fell into conversation , that it was sacrament day , and that the ceremony we had seen occurs once a month in all the valleys , and that those pure vestments do not belong to the Church , but to the Individuals who wear them . Our genial companion told D. that he lived upon the Trient , in a village high above its banks , and where , had he been at home , he would have been glad to have received us as his guests .... ” ( Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal . )</p>
   <p>“ Sunday , 16th September . Chamouny .— There is no carriage-road further than to Argentière . When , having parted with our car and Guide , we were slowly pursuing our way to the footpath , between the mountains , which was to lead us to the VALORSINE , and thence , by the Tête-Noire , to Trientz , we heard from the churchyard of Argentière , on the opposite side of the river , a sound of voices chanting a hymn , or prayer , and turning round , saw in the green enclosure a lengthening Procession ,— the priest in his robes , the host , and banners uplifted , and men following two and two — and , last of all , a great number of females , in like order ; the head and body of each covered with a white garment . The stream continued to flow on for a long time , till all had paced slowly round the church , the men gathering close together , to leave unencumbered space for the women , the chanting continuing , while the voice of the Arve joined in accordant solemnity . The procession was grave and simple , agreeing with the simple decorations of a village church :— the banners made no glittering show ; the Females composed a moving girdle round the Church ; their figures , from head to foot , covered with one piece of white cloth , resembled the small pyramids of the Glacier , which were before our eyes , and it was impossible to look at one and the other without fancifully connecting them together . Imagine the moving figures , like a stream of pyramids , the white Church , the half-concealed Village , and the Glacier close behind among pine-trees , a pure sun shining over all ! and remember that these objects were seen at the base of those enormous mountains , and you may have some faint notion of the effect produced on us by that beautiful spectacle . It was a farewell to the Vale of Chamouny that can scarcely be less vividly remembered twenty years hence than when ( that wondrous Vale [ JD ] being just out of sight ) after ascending a little way between the mountains , through a grassy hollow , we came to a small hamlet under shade of trees in summer foliage . A very narrow clear rivulet , beside the cottages , was hastening with its tribute to the Arve . This simple scene transported us instantly to our valleys of Westmoreland . A few quiet children were near the doors , and we discovered a young woman in the darkest coolest nook of shade between two of the houses , seated on the ground , intent upon her prayer-book . The rest of the inhabitants were gone to join in the devotions at Argentière . The top of the ascent ( not a long one ) being gained , we had a second cheering companion in our downward way , another Westmoreland brook of larger size , as clear as crystal , open to the sun , and ( bustling but not angry ) it coursed by our side through a tract of craggy pastoral ground . I do not speak of the needles of Montanvert , behind ; nor of other pikes up-rising before us . Such sights belong not to Westmoreland , and I could fancy that I then paid them little regard , it being for the sake of Westmoreland alone that I like to dwell on this short passage of our journey , which brought us in view of one of the most interesting of the valleys of the Alps . We descended with our little stream , and saw its brief life in a moment cut off , when it reached the Berard , the river of Black Water , which is seen falling , not in black but grey cataracts within the cove of a mountain that well deserves the former epithet , though a bed of snow and glacier ice is seen among its piky and jagged ridges . Below those bare summits , pine forests and crags are piled together , with lawns and cottages between .</p>
   <p>“ We enter at the side of the valley , crossing a wooden bridge ; then , turning our backs on the scene just described , we bend our course downward with the River , that is hurrying away , fresh from its glacier fountains ; how different a fellow-traveller from that little rivulet we had just parted from , which we had seen , still bright as silver , drop into the grey stream ! The descending Vale before us beautiful , the high enclosing hills interspersed with woods , green pasturage , and cottages . The delight we had in journeying through the Valorsine is not to be imagined , sunshine and shade were alike cheering ; while the very numerousness of the brown wood cottages ( descried among trees , or outspread on the steep lawns ) , and the people enjoying their Sabbath leisure out of doors , seemed to make a quiet spot more quiet . ” ( From Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal , vol . ii . )</p>
   <p>The following account of the festival of the Virgin , which occurred during the Wordsworths ’ visit to Engelberg , may further illustrate this poem :— “ Knots of peasants going to and returning from church , all in holiday trim . We had learned the day to be a grand Festival — the Feast of the Virgin . After breakfast , the procession streamed out of church , a beautiful spectacle , as they begirt that and the monastery . Men , women , and children , Abbot , Monks , Priests , and Choristers , a thousand persons or upwards ; the women as gay as glitter and colours could make them . Flat white hats , with ribbons and flowers , embroidered stomachers , red girdles , and their short black petticoats , embroidered with red ribbon , large shining pins in their hair , and lockets suspended from their necks . The men too , mostly , had some ornament upon their hats : the young generally a coloured ribbon , the elders black ones , tied with a bow : all well and curiously dressed ; it was a festive scene , and the most important fête in the year . Seventeen monks belong to the convent of Engelberg , and the whole valley contains about 1700 inhabitants , ” etc . ( Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal . ) — ED .</p>

    <head>ELEGIAC STANZAS</head>
    <head>The lamented Youth whose untimely death gave occasion to these elegiac verses , was Frederick William Goddard , from Boston in North America . He was in his twentieth year , and had resided for some time with a clergyman in the neighbourhood of Geneva for the completion of his education . Accompanied by a fellow-pupil , a native of Scotland , he had just set out on a Swiss tour when it was his misfortune to fall in with a friend of mine who was hastening to join our party . The travellers , after spending a day together on the road from Berne and at Soleure , took leave of each other at night , the young men having intended to proceed directly to Zurich . But early in the morning my friend found his new acquaintances , who were informed of the object of his journey , and the friends he was in pursuit of , equipped to accompany him . We met at Lucerne the succeeding evening , and Mr. G. and his fellow-student became in consequence our travelling companions for a couple of days . We ascended the Righi together ; and , after contemplating the sunrise from that noble mountain , we separated at an hour and on a spot well suited to the parting of those who were to meet no more . Our party descended through the valley of our Lady of the Snow , and our late companions , to Arth . We had hoped to meet in a few weeks at Geneva ; but on the third succeeding day ( on the 21st of August ) Mr. Goddard perished , being overset in a boat while crossing the lake of Zurich . His companion saved himself by swimming , and was hospitably received in the mansion of a Swiss gentleman ( M. Keller ) situated on the eastern coast of the lake . The corpse of poor Goddard was cast ashore on the estate of the same gentleman , who generously performed all the rites of hospitality which could be rendered to the dead as well as to the living . He caused a handsome mural monument to be erected in the church of Küsnacht , which records the premature fate of the young American , and on the shores too of the lake the traveller may read an inscription pointing out the spot where the body was deposited by the waves .<span corresp="#note559" type="note_anchor">[ 559 ]</span></head>

W. 1837 .</p>
   <p>References to Young Goddard occur in Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal , as follows :— “ Lucerne , Aug . 16 .—... In bounded Henry Robinson , ... with two young men he has picked up on the road .... ” “ Aug . 17 .— The two young Gentlemen , Mr. R .' s companions , called upon us to walk at 7 o'clock ; and very pleasing youths we found them , one an American , the other a Scotsman , by birth , students from Geneva , come out on foot for a month 's excursion . ” “ Top of Righi , Sat . 19th .— Our pleasant ingenuous companions gone . We parted immediately after breakfast . ” “ Lausanne , Sept . 20 .— Our joy was damped by hearing from Mr. Mulloch , of the melancholy fate of that very interesting youth , Mr. Goddard , with whom we parted on the top of the Righi . He , with Mr. Trotter , descended to pursue their way to Zurich , in which lake he was unfortunately drowned two days afterwards ; we towards Lauritz , but all in the hope of meeting again at Altorf .... Mr. G .' s mother is in America .... Seldom have I seen so promising a youth . ” “ Sat . 23rd . Geneva .— Met Mr. Trotter . The loss of poor Goddard was occasioned by a sudden squall , which upset one of the worthless boats , made of thin planks , flat bottomed . Mr. T. being a good swimmer , and on the side nearest the shore , reached land , when looking for his companion , he had disappeared , had been sucked under the boat , and was never seen from the first moment . Great humanity was shown by the people in the neighbourhood on this melancholy occasion . The body was found , and afterwards buried in the churchyard at Küsnacht , a village on the east shore of the lake of Zurich . A discourse in German was delivered by an old Priest , after the interment , a copy of which Mr. T. showed us ; and which Mr. R. and W. were much pleased with , for the pathetic simplicity of the expression . It was intended to be sent to the poor mother of the deceased . ”</p>
   <p>The reference towards the close of the poem to the</p>
   <p>Flowers ‘ mid Goldau 's ruins bred ;</p>
   <p>and the concluding passage of the prefatory note to the edition of 1822 , suggest another passage in Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal . “ Aug . 19 .— Dined at Goldau . This cottage-inn is built , as several other houses are , on the side of the road surrounded by masses of fallen rock : chapel close by : all walked to the ruins : sate for a long time upon an immense mass of the fallen mountain . It is an awful and an affecting place . We were surprised at the extent of the desolation , especially when we looked up to the mountain whence it had proceeded . The rent , high above us , appeared so trifling that we could not but wonder how all those mighty blocks had ever been piled upon so narrow a space . Huge masses of rock on every side of us . It is aptly called “ the valley of Stones . ” A river had thridded this once lovely and still interesting valley ; but this , with the green meadows which it fertilized , is buried ; and the lake of Lawerz below driven into narrower compass .... Three villages , with their inhabitants , had been completely destroyed . ”</p>
   <p>“ Wednesday , 19th September . Lausanne .— We met with some pleasant Englishmen , from whom we heard particulars concerning the melancholy fate of our young Friend , the American , seen by us for the last time on the top of the Righi . The tidings of his death had been first communicated , but a few hours before , by Mr. Mulloch . We had the comfort of hearing that his friend had saved himself by swimming , and had paid the last duties to the stranger , so far from home and kindred , who lies quietly in the churchyard of Küsnacht on the shores of Zurich . ” ( From Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal , vol . ii . )</p>
   <p>On the 24th Nov. 1821 , Dorothy Wordsworth wrote to Henry Crabb Robinson :— ” ... Amongst the Poems ( the Tour on the Continent ) is one to the memory of poor Goddard , which probably never would have been written but for your suggestion . How often do I think of that night when you first introduced that interesting youth to us ! At this moment I see in my mind 's eye the lighted Salon , you in your great-coat , and the two slender tall figures following you ! ” — ED .</p>

   <p>The only allusion in Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal to any noteworthy “ sky-prospect from the plain of France , ” occurs when they rested at Fontainbleau . “ Sept . 30 .—... Seeing the forest rise at the end of a long vista of trees , our guide said that from that point we should have a fine view . Passed through the old-fashioned French flower garden , with its large sheet of water .... Surprised by the view from the hill , first towards the palace , and the expanse beyond , and immediately opposite this ( what we so little expected to see ) a rocky dell in that sandy region ; most curious , the bank before us scattered thickly with rocks , by that dim light appearing like a large village . Glorious crimson light in the west , all the rest of the sky a clear cloudless blue . The evening star very large , and alone . An impressive silence in the air , so that we heard the sounds from the distant town distinctly . ”</p>
   <p>“ Saturday , 29th September . Fontainbleau .— In the very heart of the Alps , I never saw a more wild and lonely spot , yet curious in the extreme , and even beautiful . Thousands of white bleached rocks , mostly in appearance not much larger than sheep , lay on the steep declivities of the dell among bushes and low trees , heather , bilberries , and other forest plants . The effect of loneliness and desert wildness was indescribably increased by the remembrance of the Palace we had left not an hour before . The spot on which we stood is said to have been frequented by Henry the IVth . when he wished to retire from his court and attendants . A few steps more brought us in view of fresh ranges of the forest , hills , plains , and distant lonely dells . The sunset was brilliant — light clouds in the west , and overhead a spotless blue dome . As we wind along the top of the Steep , the views are still changing — the plain expands eastward , and again appear the white buildings of Fontainbleau , with something of romantic brightness in the fading light ; for we had tarried till a star or two reminded us it was time to move away . In descending , we followed one of the long straight tracks that intersect the forest in all directions . Bewildered among those tracks , we were set right by a party of wood-cutters , going home from their labour . ” ( From Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal , vol . ii . ) — ED .</p>

   <p>Near the Town of Boulogne , and overhanging the Beach , are the remains of a Tower which bears the name of Caligula , who here terminated his western Expedition , of which these sea-shells were the boasted spoils . And , at no great distance from these Ruins , Buonaparte , standing upon a mound of earth , harangued his “ Army of England , ” reminding them of the exploits of Cæsar , and , pointing towards the white cliffs upon which their standards were to float . He recommended also a subscription to be raised among the Soldiery to erect on that Ground , in memory of the Foundation of the “ Legion of Honour , ” a Column ,— which was not completed at the time we were there .— W . W. 1822 .</p>
   <p>“ Embarked in a small vessel ; wind contrary . The vessel struck upon a sandbank . Then was driven with violence upon a rocky road in the harbour . Tide was ebbing very fast . ” ( Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal . )</p>
   <p>“ Monday , 29th October . Boulogne .— We walked to Buonaparte 's Pillar , which , on the day when he harangued his soldiers ( pointing to the shores of England whither he should lead them to conquest ) , he decreed should be erected in commemoration of the Legion of Honour then established . The pillar is seen far and wide , unfinished , as the intricate casing of a scaffolding loftier than itself , shows at whatever distance it is seen . It is said the Bourbons intend to complete the work , and give it a new name ; but I think it more probable that the scaffolding may be left to fall away , and the Pile of marble remain strewn round , as it is , with unfinished blocks , an undisputed Monument of the Founder 's vanity and arrogance ; and so it may stand as long as the brick towers of Caligula have done , a remnant of which yet appears on the cliffs . We walked on the ground which had been covered by the army that dreamt of conquering England , and were shown the very spot where their Leader made his boastful speech .</p>
   <p>“ On the day fixed for our departure from Boulogne , the weather being boisterous and wind contrary , the Packet could not sail , and we trusted ourselves to a small vessel , with only one effective sailor on board . Even Mary was daunted by the Breakers outside the Harbour , and I descended into the vessel as unwillingly as a criminal might go to execution , and hid myself in bed . Presently our little ship moved ; and before ten minutes were gone she struck upon the sands . I felt that something disastrous had happened ; but knew not what till poor Mary appeared in the cabin , having been thrown down from the top of the steps . There was again a frightful beating and grating of the bottom of the vessel , water rushing in very fast . A young man , an Italian , who had risen from a bed beside mine , as pale as ashes , groaned in agony , kneeling at his prayers . My condition was not much better than his ; but I was more quiet . Never shall I forget the kindness of a little Irish woman who , though she herself , as she afterwards said , was much frightened , assured me even chearfully that there was no danger . I cannot say that her words , as assurances of safety , had much effect upon me ; but the example of her courage made me become more collected ; and I felt her human kindness even at the moment when I believed that we might be all going to the bottom of the sea together ; and the agonizing thoughts of the distress at home were rushing on my mind . ” ( From Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal , vol . ii . ) — ED .</p>

   <p>Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal of this Continental Tour contains the modest entry , made at “ Paris , Monday , Oct . 2nd .—... I shall here close these very imperfect notices , commenced at D .' s request ; and with a notion , on my part , that they might be useful when she wrote her Journal : but soon finding that , with such a view , mine was a superfluous labour , I should not have had the resolution to go on , except at Wm . ' s desire , and from the feeling that my Daughter , and perhaps her brothers , might one day find pleasure , should they ever have the good fortune to trace our steps , in recognising objects their Mother had seen . ”</p>

   <p>Sarnen , one of the two Capitals of the Canton of Underwalden ; the spot here alluded to is close to the town , and is called the Landenberg , from the Tyrant of that name , whose chateau formerly stood there . On the 1st of Jan. 1308 , the great day which the confederated Heroes had chosen for the deliverance of their Country , all the Castles of the Governors were taken by force or stratagem ; and the Tyrants themselves conducted , with their Creatures , to the frontiers , after having witnessed the destruction of their Strong-holds . From that time the Landenberg has been the place where the Legislators of this division of the Canton assemble . The site , which is well described by Ebel , is one of the most beautiful in Switzerland .— W . W. 1822 .</p>
   <p>“ Sarnen , Aug . 14 .—... The buildings we have been to visit are Government Houses . There all business relating to the canton is transacted . The meetings are sometimes held in the open air : a green area is set apart , with steps around for this purpose . Marks to shoot at , bowls , etc ., are here ready , for the days of festival , ” etc . ( Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal . )]</p>

    <p n="4">N. B .— At Paris we left our carriage , which was sold some months afterwards for half its cost .

Set off from Paris at 8 o'clock on Saturday morning , and arrived at Boulogne at about 9 on Sunday night .</p>
    <p n="5">NOTE B</p>
    <p n="6">The following are extracts from Henry Crabb Robinson 's account of his “ Swiss Tour with the Wordsworths . ” ( See Diary , Correspondence , etc ., vol . ii . pp . 167-191 . ) — ED .</p>
    <p n="7">I left London on the 1st of August , and reached Lyons on the 9th .</p>
    <p n="8">On the 15th I went to Solothurn , and an acquaintance began out of which a catastrophe sprang . In the stage between Berne and Solothurn , which takes a circuit through an unpicturesque , flat country , were two very interesting young men , who I soon learned were residing with a Protestant clergyman at Geneva , and completing their education . The elder was an American , aged twenty-one , named Goddard . He had a sickly air , but was intelligent , and not ill-read in English poetry . The other was a fine handsome lad , aged sixteen , of the name of Trotter , son of the then , or late , Secretary to the Admiralty . He was of Scotch descent . They were both genteel and well-behaved young men , with the grace communicated by living in good company . We became at once acquainted ,— I being then , as now , young in the facility of forming acquaintance . We spent a very agreeable day and evening together , partly in a walk to a hermitage in the neighbourhood , and took leave of each other at night ,— I being bound for Lucerne , they for Zürich . But in the morning I saw , to my surprise , my young friends with their knapsacks in their hands ready to accompany me . Goddard said , with a very amiable modesty , “ If you will permit us , we wish to go with you . I am an admirer of Wordsworth 's poems , and I should be delighted merely to see him . Of course I expect no more . ” I was gratified by this proposal , and we had a second day of enjoyment , and this through a very beautiful country . My expectations were not disappointed . I had heard of the Wordsworth party from travellers with whom we met . I found my friends at the Cheval Blanc . From them I had a most cordial reception , and I was in high spirits . Mrs. Wordsworth wrote in her journal : “ H. C. R. was drunk with pleasure , and made us drunk too . ” My companions also were kindly received .</p>
    <p n="9">Wordsworth and I returned to dinner , and found my young friends already in great favour with the ladies . After dinner we walked through the town , which has no other remarkable feature than the body of water flowing through it , and the several covered wooden bridges . In the angles of the roof of these bridges there are paintings on historical and allegorical subjects . One series from the Bible , another from the Swiss war against Austria , a third called the Dance of Death . The last is improperly called , for Death does not force his partner to an involuntary waltz , as in the famous designs which go by Holbein 's name , but appears in all the pictures an unwelcome visitor . There are feeling and truth in many of the conceptions , but the expression is too often ludicrous , and too often coarsely didactic .</p>
    <p n="10">August 18th .— We sailed on the lake as far as Küsnacht , the two young men being still our companions ; and between two and three we began to ascend the Righi , an indispensable achievement in a Swiss tour . We engaged beds at the Staffel , and went on to see the sun set , but we were not fortunate in the weather . Once or twice there were gleams of light on some of the lakes , but there was little charm of colouring . After an early and comfortable supper we enjoyed the distant lightning ; but it soon became very severe , and some of the rooms of the hotel were flooded with rain . Our rest was disturbed by a noisy party , who , unable to obtain beds for themselves , resolved that no one else should enjoy his . The whole night was spent by them in an incessant din of laughing , singing , and shouting . We were called up between three and four A. M ., but had a very imperfect view from this “ dread summit of the Queen of Mountains ” — Regina montium . The most beautiful part of the scene was that which arose from the clouds below us . They rose in succession sometimes concealing the country , and then opening to our view dark lakes , and gleams of very brilliant green . They sometimes descended as if into an abyss beneath us . We saw a few of the snow-mountains illuminated by the first rays of the sun .</p>
    <p n="11">My journal simply says : “ After breakfast our young gentlemen left us . ” I afterwards wrote , “ We separated at a spot well suited to the parting of those who were to meet no more . Our party descended through the valley of our ‘ Lady of the Snow , ’ and our late companions went to Arth . We hoped to meet in a few weeks at Geneva . ”</p>
    <p n="12">I will leave the order of time , and relate now all that appertains to this sad history . The young men gave us their address , and we promised to inform them when we should be at Geneva , on our return . But on that return we found that poor Goddard had perished in the lake of Zürich , on the third day after our leave-taking on the Righi .</p>
    <p n="13">I heard the story from Trotter on the 23rd of September . They had put themselves in a crazy boat ; and a storm arising , the boat overset . It righted itself , but to no purpose . Trotter swam to the shore , but Goddard was not seen again . Trotter was most hospitably received by a Mr. Keller , near whose house the catastrophe took place . The body was cast ashore next day , and afterwards interred in the neighbouring churchyard of Küsnacht . An inscription was placed near the spot where the body was found , and a mural monument erected in the church . At the funeral a pathetic address was delivered by the Protestant clergyman , which I read in the Zürich paper . We were all deeply impressed by the event . Wordsworth , I knew , was not fond of drawing the subjects of his poems from occurrences in themselves interesting , and therefore , though I urged him to write on this tragic incident , I little expected he would . There is , however , a beautiful elegiac poem by him on this subject . [ To the later editions there is prefixed a prose introduction . This I wrote . Mr. Wordsworth wrote to me for information , and I drew up the account in the first person . ]</p>
    <p n="14">To go back to the 19th of August , after parting from our young companions we proceeded down the valley in which is the chapel dedicated to our Lady of the Snow , the subject of Wordsworth 's nineteenth Poem . The preceding eighteen have to do with objects which had been seen before I joined the party . The elegiac stanzas are placed near the end of the collection , I know not for what reason . The stanzas on the chapel express poetically the thoughts which a prosaic mind like mine might receive from the numerous votive offerings hung on the walls . There are pictures representing accidents ,— such as drowning , falling from a horse , and the Mother and the Child are in the clouds ,— it being understood that the escape proceeded from her aid . Some crutches with painted inscriptions bear witness to the miracles wrought on the lame .</p>
    <p n="15">We passed the same day through Goldau , a desolate spot , once a populous village , overwhelmed by the slip from the Rossberg .</p>
    <p n="16">On the 20th at Schwytz , which Wordsworth calls the “ heart ” of Switzerland , as Berne is the “ head . ” Passing through Brunnen , we reached Altorf on the 21st , the spot which suggested Wordsworth 's twentieth effusion . My prose remark on the people shows the sad difference between observation and fancy . I wrote : “ These patriotic recollections are delightful when genuine , but the physiognomy of the people does not speak in favour of their ancestors . The natives of the district have a feeble and melancholy character . The women are afflicted by goitre . The children beg , as in other Catholic cantons . The little children , with cross-bows in their hands , sing unintelligible songs . Probably Wilhelm Tell serves , like Henri Quatre , as a name to beg by . ”</p>
    <p n="17">We next crossed the St. Gotthard . Wordsworth thinks this pass more beautiful than the more celebrated [ a blank here ] . We slept successively at Amsteg on the 22nd , Hospenthal on the 23rd , and Airolo on the 24th . On the way we were overtaken by a pedestrian , a young Swiss , who had studied at Heidelberg , and was going to Rome . He had his flute , and played the Ranz des Vaches . Wordsworth begged me to ask him to do this , which I did on condition that he wrote a sonnet on it . It is XXII . of the collection . The young man was intelligent , and expressed pleasure in our company . We were sorry when he took French leave . We were English , and I have no doubt he feared the expense of having such costly companions . He gave a sad account of the German Universities , and said that Sand , the murderer of Kotzebue , had many apologists among the students .</p>
    <p n="18">We then proceeded on our half-walk and half-drive , and slept on the 25th at Bellinzona , the first decidedly Italian town .</p>
    <p n="19">On the 27th we had a row to Luino , on the Lago Maggiore , a walk to Ponte Tresa , and then a row to Lugano , where we went to an excellent hotel , kept by a man of the name of Rossi .</p>
    <p n="20">On the 28th we took an early walk up the mountain San Salvador , which produced No . XXIV . of Wordsworth 's Memorial Poems . Though the weather was by no means favourable , we enjoyed a much finer view than from the Righi . The mountains in the neighbourhood are beautiful , but the charm of the prospect lies in a glimpse of distant mountains . We saw a most elegant pyramid , literally in the sky , partly black , and partly shining like silver . It was the Simplon , Mont Blanc and Monte Rosa were seen in parts . Clouds concealed the bases , and too soon also the summits . This splendid vision lasted but a few minutes . The plains of Piedmont were hardly visible , owing to the black clouds which covered this part of the horizon . We could , however , see in the midst of a dark surface a narrow ribbon of white , which we were told was the Po . We were told the direction in which Milan lay , but could not see the cathedral .</p>
    <p n="21">The same day we went on to Menaggio , on the Lake Como . This , in Wordsworth 's estimation , is the most beautiful of the lakes . On the 29th and 30th we slept at Cadenabbia .</p>
    <p n="22">I wrote in my journal : “ This day has been spent on the lake , and so much exquisite pleasure I never had on water . The tour , or rather excursion , we have been making surpasses in scenery all that I have ever made ; and Wordsworth asserts the same . I write now from an inn where we have been served with all the promptitude of an English hotel , and with a neatness equal to that of Holland . But the pleasure can hardly be recorded . It consists in the contemplation of scenes absolutely indescribable by words , and in sensations for which no words have been even invented . We were lucky in meeting two honest fellows of watermen , who have been attentive and not extortionate . I will not enumerate the points of view and villas we visited . We saw nothing the guide-books do not speak of . ”</p>
    <p n="23">On the 31st we slept at Como , and next day went to Milan .</p>
    <p n="24">At the Ambrosian Library we inspected the famous copy of Virgil which belonged to Petrarch . It has in the poet 's own handwriting a note , stating when and where he first saw Laura . Wordsworth was deeply interested in this entry , and would certainly have requested a copy , if he had not been satisfied that he should find it in print . The custos told us that when Buonaparte came here first , and the book was shown him , he seized it , exclaiming , “ This is mine . ” He had it bound , and his own N. marked on it . It came back when the other plunder was restored . Another curiosity was a large book by Leonardo da Vinci , full of mechanical studies . Wordsworth was much struck with the fact that a man who had produced works of so great beauty and sublimity , had prepared himself by intense and laborious study of scientific and mathematical details . It was not till late that he ventured on beauty as exhibited in the human form .</p>
    <p n="25">But the great attraction of this neighbourhood is the celebrated picture of Leonardo da Vinci in the refectory of the Convent of Maria della Grazia . After sustaining every injury from Italian monks , French soldiers , wet , and the appropriation of the building to secular purposes , this picture is now protected by the public sense of its excellence from further injury . And more remains of the original than from Goethe 's dissertation I expected to see . The face of our Saviour appears to have suffered less than any other part . And the countenance has in it exquisite feeling ; it is all sweetness and dignity .</p>
    <p n="26">Some of the Apostles have a somewhat caricature expression , which has been far better preserved in the several copies existing , as well as in the engraving of Raphael Morgen . There is a sort of mawkish sentimentality in the copies of St. John , which always offended me . There is less of it in the original . That and St. Andrew are the best preserved next to the face of Christ .</p>
    <p n="27">On the 5th of September the Wordsworths went back to the lake of Como , in order to gratify Miss Wordsworth , who wished to see every spot which her brother saw in his first journey ,— a journey made when he was young .</p>
    <p n="28">We rejoined the Wordsworths at Baveno on the 8th . Then we crossed the Simplon , resting successively on the 9th at Domo d'Ossola , 10th Simplon , 11th Turtman , and the 12th and 13th at the baths of Leuk . From this place we walked up the Gemmi , by far the most wonderful of all the passes of Switzerland I had ever , or have now ever , crossed . The most striking part is a mountain wall 1600 feet in perpendicular height , and having up it a zigzag path broad enough to enable a horse to ascend . The road is hardly visible from below . A parapet in the more dangerous parts renders it safe . Here my journal mentions our seeing men employed in picking up bees in a torpid state from the cold . The bees had swarmed four days before . It does not mention what I well recollect , and Wordsworth has made the subject of a sonnet , the continued barking of a dog irritated by the echo of his own voice . In human life this is perpetually occurring . It is said that a dog has been known to contract an illness by the continued labour of barking at his own echo . In the present instance the barking lasted while we were on the spot .</p>
    <p n="29">I say nothing of Chamouni , where we slept two nights , the 15th and 16th ; nor of the roads to it , but that the Tête Noire , by which we returned , is still more interesting than the Col de Balme , by which we went . Again at Martigny on the 17th . I should not have omitted to mention that , to add to the sadness produced by the Valais , Wordsworth remarked that there the Alps themselves were in a state of decay — crumbling to pieces . His is the line :—</p>
    <p n="30">The human soul craves something that endures .</p>
    <p n="31">On the 18th we were at Villeneuve , and on the 19th and 20th at Lausanne .</p>
    <p n="32">At Paris I renewed my old acquaintances , and saw the old sights .</p>
    <p n="33">On the 8th I left the Wordsworths , who were intending to prolong their stay . On the 9th I slept at Amiens ; on the 10th was on the road ; on the 11th reached Dover ; and on the 12th of October slept in my own chambers .</p>
    <p n="34">“ And so , ” my journal says , “ I concluded my tour in excellent health and spirits , having travelled farther , and seen a greater number and a greater variety of sublime and beautiful objects , and in company better calculated to make me feel the worth of these objects , than any it has been my good fortune to enjoy . ”</p>
