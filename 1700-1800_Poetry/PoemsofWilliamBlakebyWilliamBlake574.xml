    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">Piping down the valleys wild , Piping songs of pleasant glee , On a cloud I saw a child , And he laughing said to me :</p>
    <p n="2">“ Pipe a song about a Lamb ! ” So I piped with merry cheer . “ Piper , pipe that song again ; ” So I piped : he wept to hear .</p>
    <p n="3">“ Drop thy pipe , thy happy pipe ; Sing thy songs of happy cheer ! ” So I sang the same again , While he wept with joy to hear .</p>
    <p n="4">“ Piper , sit thee down and write In a book , that all may read . ” So he vanish 'd from my sight ; And I pluck 'd a hollow reed ,</p>
    <p n="5">And I made a rural pen , And I stain 'd the water clear , And I wrote my happy songs Every child may joy to hear .</p>

    <head>THE LITTLE BLACK BOY</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">My mother bore me in the southern wild ,</l>
     <l n="2">And I am black , but oh my soul is white !</l>
     <l n="3">White as an angel is the English child ,</l>
     <l n="4">But I am black , as if bereaved of light .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">My mother taught me underneath a tree ,</l>
     <l n="6">And , sitting down before the heat of day ,</l>
     <l n="7">She took me on her lap and kissed me ,</l>
     <l n="8">And , pointed to the east , began to say :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">“ Look on the rising sun : there God does live ,</l>
     <l n="10">And gives His light , and gives His heat away ,</l>
     <l n="11">And flowers and trees and beasts and men receive</l>
     <l n="12">Comfort in morning , joy in the noonday .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">“ And we are put on earth a little space ,</l>
     <l n="14">That we may learn to bear the beams of love</l>

     <l n="16">Is but a cloud , and like a shady grove .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">“ For when our souls have learn 'd the heat to bear ,</l>
     <l n="18">The cloud will vanish , we shall hear His voice ,</l>
     <l n="19">Saying , ‘ Come out from the grove , my love and care</l>
     <l n="20">And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice ’ , ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">Thus did my mother say , and kissed me ;</l>
     <l n="22">And thus I say to little English boy .</l>
     <l n="23">When I from black and he from white cloud free ,</l>
     <l n="24">And round the tent of God like lambs we joy</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">I 'll shade him from the heat till he can bear</l>
     <l n="26">To lean in joy upon our Father 's knee ;</l>

    <head>THE BLOSSOM</head>
     <l n="1">Merry , merry sparrow !</l>
     <l n="2">Under leaves so green</l>
     <l n="3">A happy blossom</l>
     <l n="4">Sees you , swift as arrow ,</l>
     <l n="5">Seek your cradle narrow ,</l>
     <l n="6">Near my bosom .</l>
     <l n="7">Pretty , pretty robin !</l>
     <l n="8">Under leaves so green</l>
     <l n="9">A happy blossom</l>

    <head>THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">When my mother died I was very young ,</l>
     <l n="2">And my father sold me while yet my tongue</l>
     <l n="3">Could scarcely cry “ Weep ! weep ! weep ! weep ! ”</l>
     <l n="4">So your chimneys I sweep , and in soot I sleep .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">There 's little Tom Dacre , who cried when his head ,</l>
     <l n="6">That curled like a lamb 's back , was shaved ; so I said ,</l>
     <l n="7">“ Hush , Tom ! never mind it , for , when your head 's bare ,</l>
     <l n="8">You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">And so he was quiet , and that very night ,</l>
     <l n="10">As Tom was a-sleeping , he had such a sight !—</l>
     <l n="11">That thousands of sweepers , Dick , Joe , Ned , and Jack ,</l>
     <l n="12">Were all of them locked up in coffins of black .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">And by came an angel , who had a bright key ,</l>
     <l n="14">And he opened the coffins , and let them all free ;</l>
     <l n="15">Then down a green plain , leaping , laughing , they run ,</l>
     <l n="16">And wash in a river , and shine in the sun .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Then naked and white , all their bags left behind ,</l>
     <l n="18">They rise upon clouds , and sport in the wind ;</l>
     <l n="19">And the Angel told Tom , if he 'd be a good boy ,</l>
     <l n="20">He 'd have God for his father , and never want joy .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">And so Tom awoke , and we rose in the dark ,</l>
     <l n="22">And got with our bags and our brushes to work .</l>
     <l n="23">Though the morning was cold , Tom was happy and warm :</l>
     <l n="24">So , if all do their duty , they need not fear harm .</l>

     <l n="4">Or else I shall be lost . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">The night was dark , no father was there ,</l>
     <l n="6">The child was wet with dew ;</l>

     <l n="1">The little boy lost in the lonely fen ,</l>
     <l n="2">Led by the wandering light ,</l>
     <l n="3">Began to cry , but God , ever nigh ,</l>
     <l n="4">Appeared like his father , in white .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">He kissed the child , and by the hand led ,</l>

    <head>LAUGHING SONG</head>
     <l n="1">When the green woods laugh with the voice of joy ,</l>
     <l n="2">And the dimpling stream runs laughing by ;</l>
     <l n="3">When the air does laugh with our merry wit ,</l>
     <l n="4">And the green hill laughs with the noise of it ;</l>
   </lg>
   <p>when the meadows laugh with lively green , And the grasshopper laughs in the merry scene , When Mary and Susan and Emily With their sweet round mouths sing “ Ha , ha he ! ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">When the painted birds laugh in the shade ,</l>
     <l n="2">Where our table with cherries and nuts is spread :</l>
     <l n="3">Come live , and be merry , and join with me ,</l>
     <l n="4">To sing the sweet chorus of “ Ha , ha , he ! ”</l>

    <p n="10">The Author &amp; Printer Willm . Blake . 1780</p>
    <p n="11">THEL</p>
    <p n="12">I</p>
    <p n="13">The daughters of Mne Seraphim led round their sunny flocks , All but the youngest : she in paleness sought the secret air . To fade away like morning beauty from her mortal day : Down by the river of Adona her soft voice is heard ; And thus her gentle lamentation falls like morning dew .</p>
    <p n="14">O life of this our spring ! why fades the lotus of the water ? Why fade these children of the spring ? born but to smile &amp; fall . Ah ! Thel is like a watry bow , and like a parting cloud , Like a reflection in a glass : like shadows in the water Like dreams of infants , like a smile upon an infants face . Like the doves voice , like transient day , like music in the air : Ah ! gentle may I lay me down and gentle rest my head . And gentle sleep the sleep of death , and gently hear the voice Of him that walketh in the garden in the evening time .</p>
    <p n="15">The Lilly of the valley breathing in the humble grass Answerd the lovely maid and said : I am a watry weed , And I am very small and love to dwell in lowly vales : So weak the gilded butterfly scarce perches on my head Yet I am visited from heaven and he that smiles on all Walks in the valley , and each morn over me spreads his hand Saying , rejoice thou humble grass , thou new-born lily flower . Thou gentle maid of silent valleys and of modest brooks : For thou shall be clothed in light , and fed with morning manna : Till summers heat melts thee beside the fountains and the springs To flourish in eternal vales : they why should Thel complain . Why should the mistress of the vales of Har , utter a sigh .</p>
    <p n="16">She ceasd &amp; smild in tears , then sat down in her silver shrine .</p>
    <p n="17">Thel answerd , O thou little virgin of the peaceful valley . Giving to those that cannot crave , the voiceless , the o'er tired The breath doth nourish the innocent lamb , he smells the milky garments He crops thy flowers while thou sittest smiling in his face , Wiping his mild and meekin mouth from all contagious taints . Thy wine doth purify the golden honey ; thy perfume . Which thou dost scatter on every little blade of grass that springs Revives the milked cow , &amp; tames the fire-breathing steed . But Thel is like a faint cloud kindled at the rising sun : I vanish from my pearly throne , and who shall find my place .</p>
    <p n="18">Queen of the vales the Lily answered , ask the tender cloud , And it shall tell thee why it glitters in the morning sky . And why it scatters its bright beauty thro the humid air . Descend O little cloud &amp; hover before the eyes of Thel .</p>
    <p n="19">The Cloud descended and the Lily bowd her modest head : And went to mind her numerous charge among the verdant grass .</p>
    <p n="20">II .</p>
    <p n="21">O little Cloud the virgin said , I charge thee to tell me Why thou complainest now when in one hour thou fade away : Then we shall seek thee but not find : ah Thel is like to thee . I pass away , yet I complain , and no one hears my voice .</p>
    <p n="22">The Cloud then shewd his golden head &amp; his bright form emerg 'd . Hovering and glittering on the air before the face of Thel .</p>
    <p n="23">O virgin know'st thou not our steeds drink of the golden springs Where Luvah doth renew his horses : lookst thou on my youth . And fearest thou because I vanish and am seen no more . Nothing remains ; O maid I tell thee , when I pass away . It is to tenfold life , to love , to peace , and raptures holy : Unseen descending , weigh my light wings upon balmy flowers : And court the fair eyed dew , to take me to her shining tent The weeping virgin , trembling kneels before the risen sun . Till we arise link 'd in a golden band and never part : But walk united bearing food to all our tender flowers .</p>
    <p n="24">Dost thou O little cloud ? I fear that I am not like thee : For I walk through the vales of Har , and smell the sweetest flowers : But I feed not the little flowers : I hear the warbling birds , But I feed not the warbling birds , they fly and seek their food : But Thel delights in these no more because I fade away And all shall say , without a use this shining women liv 'd , Or did she only live to be at death the food of worms .</p>
    <p n="25">The Cloud reclind upon his airy throne and answerd thus .</p>
    <p n="26">Then if thou art the food of worms , O virgin of the skies , How great thy use , how great thy blessing , every thing that lives . Lives not alone nor or itself : fear not and I will call , The weak worm from its lowly bed , and thou shalt hear its voice . Come forth worm and the silent valley , to thy pensive queen .</p>
    <p n="27">The helpless worm arose and sat upon the Lillys leaf , And the bright Cloud saild on , to find his partner in the vale .</p>
    <p n="28">III .</p>
    <p n="29">Then Thel astonish 'd view 'd the Worm upon its dewy bed .</p>
    <p n="30">Art thou a Worm ? image of weakness , art thou but a Worm ? I see thee like an infant wrapped in the Lillys leaf ; Ah weep not little voice , thou can'st not speak , but thou can'st weep : Is this a Worm ? I see they lay helpless &amp; naked : weeping And none to answer , none to cherish thee with mothers smiles .</p>
    <p n="31">The Clod of Clay heard the Worms voice &amp; rais 'd her pitying head : She bowd over the weeping infant , and her life exhald In milky fondness , then on Thel she fix 'd her humble eyes ;</p>
    <p n="32">O beauty of the vales of Har , we live not for ourselves , Thou seest me the meanest thing , and so I am indeed : My bosom of itself is cold , and of itself is dark ,</p>
    <p n="33">But he that loves the lowly , pours his oil upon my head And kisses me , and binds his nuptial bands around my breast . And says ; Thou mother of my children , I have loved thee And I have given thee a crown that none can take away . But how this is sweet maid , I know not , and I cannot know I ponder , and I cannot ponder ; yet I live and love .</p>
    <p n="34">The daughter of beauty wip 'd her pitying tears with her white veil , And said , Alas ! I knew not this , and therefore did I weep : That God would love a Worm I knew , and punish the evil foot That wilful bruis 'd its helpless form : but that he cherish 'd it With milk and oil I never knew , and therefore did I weep , And I complaind in the mild air , because I fade away . And lay me down in thy cold bed , and leave my shining lot .</p>
    <p n="35">Queen of the vales , the matron Clay answered : I heard thy sighs . And all thy moans flew o'er my roof , but I have call 'd them down : Wilt thou O Queen enter my house , tis given thee to enter , And to return : fear nothing , enter with thy virgin feet .</p>
    <p n="36">IV .</p>
    <p n="37">The eternal gates terrific porter lifted the northern bar : Thel enter 'd in &amp; saw the secrets of the land unknown ; She saw the couches of the dead , &amp; where the fibrous roots Of every heart on earth infixes deep its restless twists : A land of sorrows &amp; of tears where never smile was seen .</p>
    <p n="38">She wandered in the land of clouds thro ’ valleys dark , listning Dolors &amp; lamentations : waiting oft beside the dewy grave She stood in silence , listning to the voices of the ground , Till to her own grave plot she came , &amp; there she sat down . And heard this voice of sorrow breathed from the hollow pit .</p>
    <p n="39">Why cannot the Ear be closed to its own destruction ? Or the glistening Eye to the poison of a smile ! Why are Eyelids stord with arrows ready drawn , Where a thousand fighting men in ambush lie ! Or an Eye of gifts &amp; graces showring fruits &amp; coined gold !</p>
    <p n="40">Why a Tongue impress 'd with honey from every wind ? Why an Ear , a whirlpool fierce to draw creations in ? Why a Nostril wide inhaling terror trembling &amp; affright Why a tender curb upon the youthful burning boy ? Why a little curtain of flesh on the bed of our desire ?</p>
    <p n="41">The Virgin started from her seat , &amp; with a shriek , Fled back unhinderd till she came into the vales of Har .</p>
