    <head>INTRODUCTION .</head>
    <p n="1">After the publication of his “ Table Talk ” and other poems in March , 1782 , William Cowper , in his quiet retirement at Olney , under Mrs. Unwin 's care , found a new friend in Lady Austen . She was a baronet 's widow who had a sister married to a clergyman near Olney , with whom Cowper was slightly acquainted . In the summer of 1781 , when his first volume was being printed , Cowper met Lady Austen and her sister in the street at Olney , and persuaded Mrs. Unwin to invite them to tea . Their coming was the beginning of a cordial friendship . Lady Austen , without being less earnest , had a liveliness that satisfied Cowper 's sense of fun to an extent that stirred at last some jealousy in Mrs. Unwin . “ She had lived much in France , ” Cowper said , “ was very sensible , and had infinite vivacity . ”</p>
    <p n="2">The Vicar of Olney was in difficulties , with his affairs in the hands of trustees . The duties of his office were entirely discharged by a curate , and the vicarage was to let . Lady Austen , in 1782 , rented it , to be near her new friends . There was only a wall between the garden of the house occupied by Cowper and Mrs. Unwin and the vicarage garden . A door was made in the wall , and there was a close companionship of three . When Lady Austen did not spend her evenings with Mrs. Unwin and Cowper , Mrs. Unwin and Cowper spent their evenings with Lady Austen . They read , talked , Lady Austen played and sang , and they all called one another by their Christian names , William , Mary ( Mrs. Unwin ) , and Anna ( Lady Austen ) . In a poetical epistle to Lady Austen , written in December , 1781 , Cowper closes a reference to the strength of their friendship with the evidence it gave ,—</p>
    <p n="3">“ That Solomon has wisely spoken ,— ‘ A threefold cord is not soon broken . ’ ”</p>
    <p n="4">One evening in the summer of 1782 , when Cowper was low-spirited , Lady Austen told him in lively fashion the story upon which he founded the ballad of “ John Gilpin . ” Its original hero is said to have been a Mr. Bayer , who had a draper 's shop in London , at the corner of Cheapside . Cowper was so much tickled by it , that he lay awake part of the night rhyming and laughing , and by the next evening the ballad was complete . It was sent to Mrs. Unwin 's son , who sent it to the Public Advertiser , where for the next two or three years it lay buried in the “ Poets ’ Corner , ” and attracted no particular attention .</p>
    <p n="5">In the summer of 1783 , when one of the three friends had been reading blank verse aloud to the other two , Lady Austen , from her seat upon the sofa , urged upon Cowper , as she had urged before , that blank verse was to be preferred to the rhymed couplets in which his first book had been written , and that he should write a poem in blank verse . “ I will , ” he said , “ if you will give me a subject . ” “ Oh , ” she answered , “ you can write upon anything . Write on this sofa . ” He playfully accepted that as “ the task ” set him , and began his poem called “ The Task , ” which was finished in the summer of the next year , 1784 . But before “ The Task ” was finished , Mrs. Unwin 's jealousy obliged Cowper to give up his new friend — whom he had made a point of calling upon every morning at eleven — and prevent her return to summer quarters in the vicarage .</p>
    <p n="6">Two miles from Olney was Weston Underwood with a park , to which its owner gave Cowper the use of a key . In 1782 a younger brother , John Throckmorton , came with his wife to live at Weston , and continued Cowper 's privilege . The Throckmortons were Roman Catholics , but in May , 1784 , Mr. Unwin was tempted by an invitation to see a balloon ascent from their park . Their kindness as hosts won upon Cowper ; they sought and had his more intimate friendship , till in his correspondence he playfully abused the first syllable of their name and called them Mr. and Mrs. Frog .</p>
    <p n="7">Cowper 's “ Task ” went to its publisher and printing was begun , when suddenly “ John Gilpin , ” after a long sleep in the Public Advertiser , rode triumphant through the town . A favourite actor of the day was giving recitations at Freemason 's Hall . A man of letters , Richard Sharp , who had read and liked “ John Gilpin , ” pointed out to the actor how well it would suit his purpose . The actor was John Henderson , whose Hamlet , Shylock , Richard III ., and Falstaff were the most popular of his day . He died suddenly in 1785 , at the age of thirty-eight , and it was thus in the last year of his life that his power of recitation drew “ John Gilpin ” from obscurity and made it the nine days ’ wonder of the town . Pictures of John Gilpin abounded in all forms . He figured on pocket-handkerchiefs . When the publisher asked for a few more pages to his volume of “ The Task , ” Cowper gave him as makeweights an “ Epistle to Joseph Hill , ” his “ Tirocinium , ” and , a little doubtfully , “ John Gilpin . ” So the book was published in June , 1785 ; was sought by many because it was by the author of “ John Gilpin , ” and at once won recognition . The preceding volume had not made Cowper famous . “ The Task ” at once gave him his place among the poets .</p>
    <p n="8">Cowper 's “ Task ” is to this day , except Wordsworth 's “ Excursion , ” the best purely didactic poem in the English language . The “ Sofa ” stands only as a point of departure :— it suits a gouty limb ; but as the poet is not gouty , he is up and off . He is off for a walk with Mrs. Unwin in the country about Olney . He dwells on the rural sights and rural sounds , taking first the inanimate sounds , then the animate . In muddy winter weather he walks alone , finds a solitary cottage , and draws from it comment upon the false sentiment of solitude . He describes the walk to the park at Weston Underwood , the prospect from the hilltop , touches upon his privilege in having a key of the gate , describes the avenues of trees , the wilderness , the grove , and the sound of the thresher 's flail then suggests to him that all live by energy , best ease is after toil . He compares the luxury of art with wholesomeness of Nature free to all , that brings health to the sick , joy to the returned seafarer . Spleen vexes votaries of artificial life . True gaiety is for the innocent . So thought flows on , and touches in its course the vital questions of a troubled time . “ The Task ” appeared four years before the outbreak of the French Revolution , and is in many passages not less significant of rising storms than the “ Excursion ” is significant of what came with the breaking of the clouds .</p>

    <head>THE SOFA .</head>
    <note>“ The history of the following production is briefly this :— A lady , fond of blank verse , demanded a poem of that kind from the author , and gave him the SOFA for a subject . He obeyed , and having much leisure , connected another subject with it ; and , pursuing the train of thought to which his situation and turn of mind led him , brought forth , at length , instead of the trifle which he at first intended , a serious affair — a volume .</note>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I sing the Sofa . I , who lately sang</l>
     <l n="2">Truth , Hope , and Charity , and touched with awe</l>
     <l n="3">The solemn chords , and with a trembling hand ,</l>
     <l n="4">Escaped with pain from that advent'rous flight ,</l>
     <l n="5">Now seek repose upon a humbler theme :</l>
     <l n="6">The theme though humble , yet august and proud</l>
     <l n="7">The occasion — for the Fair commands the song .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">Time was , when clothing sumptuous or for use ,</l>
     <l n="9">Save their own painted skins , our sires had none .</l>
     <l n="10">As yet black breeches were not ; satin smooth ,</l>
     <l n="11">Or velvet soft , or plush with shaggy pile :</l>
     <l n="12">The hardy chief upon the rugged rock</l>
     <l n="13">Washed by the sea , or on the gravelly bank</l>
     <l n="14">Thrown up by wintry torrents roaring loud ,</l>
     <l n="15">Fearless of wrong , reposed his weary strength .</l>
     <l n="16">Those barbarous ages past , succeeded next</l>
     <l n="17">The birthday of invention ; weak at first ,</l>
     <l n="18">Dull in design , and clumsy to perform .</l>
     <l n="19">Joint-stools were then created ; on three legs</l>
     <l n="20">Upborne they stood . Three legs upholding firm</l>
     <l n="21">A massy slab , in fashion square or round .</l>
     <l n="22">On such a stool immortal Alfred sat ,</l>
     <l n="23">And swayed the sceptre of his infant realms ;</l>
     <l n="24">And such in ancient halls and mansions drear</l>
     <l n="25">May still be seen , but perforated sore</l>
     <l n="26">And drilled in holes the solid oak is found ,</l>
     <l n="27">By worms voracious eating through and through .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="28">At length a generation more refined</l>
     <l n="29">Improved the simple plan , made three legs four ,</l>
     <l n="30">Gave them a twisted form vermicular ,</l>
     <l n="31">And o'er the seat , with plenteous wadding stuffed ,</l>
     <l n="32">Induced a splendid cover green and blue ,</l>
     <l n="33">Yellow and red , of tapestry richly wrought</l>
     <l n="34">And woven close , or needlework sublime .</l>
     <l n="35">There might ye see the peony spread wide ,</l>
     <l n="36">The full-blown rose , the shepherd and his lass ,</l>
     <l n="37">Lapdog and lambkin with black staring eyes ,</l>
     <l n="38">And parrots with twin cherries in their beak .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="39">Now came the cane from India , smooth and bright</l>
     <l n="40">With Nature 's varnish ; severed into stripes</l>
     <l n="41">That interlaced each other , these supplied ,</l>
     <l n="42">Of texture firm , a lattice-work that braced</l>
     <l n="43">The new machine , and it became a chair .</l>
     <l n="44">But restless was the chair ; the back erect</l>
     <l n="45">Distressed the weary loins that felt no ease ;</l>
     <l n="46">The slippery seat betrayed the sliding part</l>
     <l n="47">That pressed it , and the feet hung dangling down ,</l>
     <l n="48">Anxious in vain to find the distant floor .</l>
     <l n="49">These for the rich : the rest , whom fate had placed</l>
     <l n="50">In modest mediocrity , content</l>
     <l n="51">With base materials , sat on well-tanned hides</l>
     <l n="52">Obdurate and unyielding , glassy smooth ,</l>
     <l n="53">With here and there a tuft of crimson yarn ,</l>
     <l n="54">Or scarlet crewel in the cushion fixed :</l>
     <l n="55">If cushion might be called , what harder seemed</l>
     <l n="56">Than the firm oak of which the frame was formed .</l>
     <l n="57">No want of timber then was felt or feared</l>
     <l n="58">In Albion 's happy isle . The lumber stood</l>
     <l n="59">Ponderous , and fixed by its own massy weight .</l>
     <l n="60">But elbows still were wanting ; these , some say ,</l>
     <l n="61">An alderman of Cripplegate contrived ,</l>
     <l n="62">And some ascribe the invention to a priest</l>
     <l n="63">Burly and big , and studious of his ease .</l>
     <l n="64">But rude at first , and not with easy slope</l>
     <l n="65">Receding wide , they pressed against the ribs ,</l>
     <l n="66">And bruised the side , and elevated high</l>
     <l n="67">Taught the raised shoulders to invade the ears .</l>
     <l n="68">Long time elapsed or e'er our rugged sires</l>
     <l n="69">Complained , though incommodiously pent in ,</l>
     <l n="70">And ill at ease behind . The ladies first</l>
     <l n="71">Gan murmur , as became the softer sex .</l>
     <l n="72">Ingenious fancy , never better pleased</l>
     <l n="73">Than when employed to accommodate the fair ,</l>
     <l n="74">Heard the sweet moan with pity , and devised</l>
     <l n="75">The soft settee ; one elbow at each end ,</l>
     <l n="76">And in the midst an elbow , it received ,</l>
     <l n="77">United yet divided , twain at once .</l>
     <l n="78">So sit two kings of Brentford on one throne ;</l>
     <l n="79">And so two citizens who take the air ,</l>
     <l n="80">Close packed and smiling in a chaise and one .</l>
     <l n="81">But relaxation of the languid frame</l>
     <l n="82">By soft recumbency of outstretched limbs ,</l>
     <l n="83">Was bliss reserved for happier days ; so slow</l>
     <l n="84">The growth of what is excellent , so hard</l>
     <l n="85">To attain perfection in this nether world .</l>
     <l n="86">Thus first necessity invented stools ,</l>
     <l n="87">Convenience next suggested elbow-chairs ,</l>
     <l n="88">And luxury the accomplished Sofa last .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="89">The nurse sleeps sweetly , hired to watch the sick ,</l>
     <l n="90">Whom snoring she disturbs . As sweetly he</l>
     <l n="91">Who quits the coach-box at the midnight hour</l>
     <l n="92">To sleep within the carriage more secure ,</l>
     <l n="93">His legs depending at the open door .</l>
     <l n="94">Sweet sleep enjoys the curate in his desk ,</l>
     <l n="95">The tedious rector drawling o'er his head ,</l>
     <l n="96">And sweet the clerk below ; but neither sleep</l>
     <l n="97">Of lazy nurse , who snores the sick man dead ,</l>
     <l n="98">Nor his who quits the box at midnight hour</l>
     <l n="99">To slumber in the carriage more secure ,</l>
     <l n="100">Nor sleep enjoyed by curate in his desk ,</l>
     <l n="101">Nor yet the dozings of the clerk are sweet ,</l>
     <l n="102">Compared with the repose the Sofa yields .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="103">Oh , may I live exempted ( while I live</l>
     <l n="104">Guiltless of pampered appetite obscene )</l>
     <l n="105">From pangs arthritic that infest the toe</l>
     <l n="106">Of libertine excess . The Sofa suits</l>
     <l n="107">The gouty limb , ‘ tis true ; but gouty limb ,</l>
     <l n="108">Though on a Sofa , may I never feel :</l>
     <l n="109">For I have loved the rural walk through lanes</l>
     <l n="110">Of grassy swarth , close cropped by nibbling sheep ,</l>
     <l n="111">And skirted thick with intertexture firm</l>
     <l n="112">Of thorny boughs : have loved the rural walk</l>
     <l n="113">O'er hills , through valleys , and by river 's brink ,</l>
     <l n="114">E'er since a truant boy I passed my bounds</l>
     <l n="115">To enjoy a ramble on the banks of Thames .</l>
     <l n="116">And still remember , nor without regret</l>
     <l n="117">Of hours that sorrow since has much endeared ,</l>
     <l n="118">How oft , my slice of pocket store consumed ,</l>
     <l n="119">Still hungering penniless and far from home ,</l>
     <l n="120">I fed on scarlet hips and stony haws ,</l>
     <l n="121">Or blushing crabs , or berries that emboss</l>
     <l n="122">The bramble , black as jet , or sloes austere .</l>
     <l n="123">Hard fare ! but such as boyish appetite</l>
     <l n="124">Disdains not , nor the palate undepraved</l>
     <l n="125">By culinary arts unsavoury deems .</l>
     <l n="126">No Sofa then awaited my return ,</l>
     <l n="127">No Sofa then I needed . Youth repairs</l>
     <l n="128">His wasted spirits quickly , by long toil</l>
     <l n="129">Incurring short fatigue ; and though our years ,</l>
     <l n="130">As life declines , speed rapidly away ,</l>
     <l n="131">And not a year but pilfers as he goes</l>
     <l n="132">Some youthful grace that age would gladly keep ,</l>
     <l n="133">A tooth or auburn lock , and by degrees</l>
     <l n="134">Their length and colour from the locks they spare ;</l>
     <l n="135">The elastic spring of an unwearied foot</l>
     <l n="136">That mounts the stile with ease , or leaps the fence ,</l>
     <l n="137">That play of lungs inhaling and again</l>
     <l n="138">Respiring freely the fresh air , that makes</l>
     <l n="139">Swift pace or steep ascent no toil to me ,</l>
     <l n="140">Mine have not pilfered yet ; nor yet impaired</l>
     <l n="141">My relish of fair prospect ; scenes that soothed</l>
     <l n="142">Or charmed me young , no longer young , I find</l>
     <l n="143">Still soothing and of power to charm me still .</l>
     <l n="144">And witness , dear companion of my walks ,</l>
     <l n="145">Whose arm this twentieth winter I perceive</l>
     <l n="146">Fast locked in mine , with pleasure such as love ,</l>
     <l n="147">Confirmed by long experience of thy worth</l>
     <l n="148">And well-tried virtues , could alone inspire —</l>
     <l n="149">Witness a joy that thou hast doubled long .</l>
     <l n="150">Thou know'st my praise of Nature most sincere ,</l>
     <l n="151">And that my raptures are not conjured up</l>
     <l n="152">To serve occasions of poetic pomp ,</l>
     <l n="153">But genuine , and art partner of them all .</l>
     <l n="154">How oft upon yon eminence , our pace</l>
     <l n="155">Has slackened to a pause , and we have borne</l>
     <l n="156">The ruffling wind scarce conscious that it blew ,</l>
     <l n="157">While admiration feeding at the eye ,</l>
     <l n="158">And still unsated , dwelt upon the scene !</l>
     <l n="159">Thence with what pleasure have we just discerned</l>
     <l n="160">The distant plough slow-moving , and beside</l>
     <l n="161">His labouring team , that swerved not from the track ,</l>
     <l n="162">The sturdy swain diminished to a boy !</l>
     <l n="163">Here Ouse , slow winding through a level plain</l>
     <l n="164">Of spacious meads with cattle sprinkled o'er ,</l>
     <l n="165">Conducts the eye along his sinuous course</l>
     <l n="166">Delighted . There , fast rooted in his bank</l>
     <l n="167">Stand , never overlooked , our favourite elms</l>
     <l n="168">That screen the herdsman 's solitary hut ;</l>
     <l n="169">While far beyond and overthwart the stream</l>
     <l n="170">That , as with molten glass , inlays the vale ,</l>
     <l n="171">The sloping land recedes into the clouds ;</l>
     <l n="172">Displaying on its varied side the grace</l>
     <l n="173">Of hedgerow beauties numberless , square tower ,</l>
     <l n="174">Tall spire , from which the sound of cheerful bells</l>
     <l n="175">Just undulates upon the listening ear ;</l>
     <l n="176">Groves , heaths , and smoking villages remote .</l>
     <l n="177">Scenes must be beautiful which daily viewed</l>
     <l n="178">Please daily , and whose novelty survives</l>
     <l n="179">Long knowledge and the scrutiny of years :</l>
     <l n="180">Praise justly due to those that I describe .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="181">Nor rural sights alone , but rural sounds</l>
     <l n="182">Exhilarate the spirit , and restore</l>
     <l n="183">The tone of languid Nature . Mighty winds ,</l>
     <l n="184">That sweep the skirt of some far-spreading wood</l>
     <l n="185">Of ancient growth , make music not unlike</l>

     <l n="701">A lucid mirror , in which nature sees</l>
     <l n="702">All her reflected features . Bacon there</l>

     <l n="717">All distance , motion , magnitude , and now</l>

     <l n="743">The total ordinance and will of God ;</l>

     <l n="704">Bespoke him past the bounds of freakish youth ,</l>
     <l n="705">But strong for service still , and unimpaired .</l>
     <l n="706">His eye was meek and gentle , and a smile</l>
     <l n="707">Played on his lips , and in his speech was heard</l>
     <l n="708">Paternal sweetness , dignity , and love .</l>
     <l n="709">The occupation dearest to his heart</l>
     <l n="710">Was to encourage goodness . He would stroke</l>

     <l n="712">That blushed at its own praise , and press the youth</l>
     <l n="713">Close to his side that pleased him . Learning grew</l>
     <l n="714">Beneath his care , a thriving , vigorous plant ;</l>
     <l n="715">The mind was well informed , the passions held</l>
     <l n="716">Subordinate , and diligence was choice .</l>
     <l n="717">If e'er it chanced , as sometimes chance it must ,</l>
     <l n="718">That one among so many overleaped</l>
     <l n="719">The limits of control , his gentle eye</l>

     <l n="723">As left him not , till penitence had won</l>
     <l n="724">Lost favour back again , and closed the breach .</l>

     <l n="727">A palsy struck his arm , his sparkling eye</l>

     <l n="744">The curbs invented for the mulish mouth</l>

     <l n="756">And such expense as pinches parents blue</l>
     <l n="757">And mortifies the liberal hand of love ,</l>
     <l n="758">Is squandered in pursuit of idle sports</l>
     <l n="759">And vicious pleasures ; buys the boy a name ,</l>

     <l n="768">His folly , but to spoil him is a task</l>

     <l n="770">Of fashion , dissipation , taverns , stews .</l>
     <l n="771">Now , blame we most the nurselings , or the nurse ?</l>
     <l n="772">The children crooked and twisted and deformed</l>
     <l n="773">Through want of care , or her whose winking eye</l>
     <l n="774">And slumbering oscitancy mars the brood ?</l>
     <l n="775">The nurse no doubt . Regardless of her charge ,</l>
     <l n="776">She needs herself correction ; needs to learn</l>
     <l n="777">That it is dangerous sporting with the world ,</l>

     <l n="406">Servile employ — but such as may amuse ,</l>

     <l n="416">Impaired by age , his unrelenting hand</l>
     <l n="417">Dooms to the knife . Nor does he spare the soft</l>

     <l n="424">At measured distances , that air and sun</l>
     <l n="425">Admitted freely may afford their aid ,</l>
     <l n="426">And ventilate and warm the swelling buds .</l>
     <l n="427">Hence Summer has her riches , Autumn hence ,</l>

     <l n="682">By vicious custom raging uncontrolled</l>
     <l n="683">Abroad and desolating public life .</l>
     <l n="684">When fierce temptation , seconded within</l>
     <l n="685">By traitor appetite , and armed with darts</l>
     <l n="686">Tempered in hell , invades the throbbing breast ,</l>
     <l n="687">To combat may be glorious , and success</l>
     <l n="688">Perhaps may crown us , but to fly is safe .</l>
     <l n="689">Had I the choice of sublunary good ,</l>
     <l n="690">What could I wish that I possess not here ?</l>
     <l n="691">Health , leisure ; means to improve it , friendship , peace ,</l>
     <l n="692">No loose or wanton though a wandering muse ,</l>
     <l n="693">And constant occupation without care .</l>
     <l n="694">Thus blest , I draw a picture of that bliss ;</l>
     <l n="695">Hopeless , indeed , that dissipated minds</l>
     <l n="696">And profligate abusers of a world</l>
     <l n="697">Created fair so much in vain for them ,</l>
     <l n="698">Should seek the guiltless joys that I describe ,</l>
     <l n="699">Allured by my report ; but sure no less</l>
     <l n="700">That self-condemned they must neglect the prize ,</l>
     <l n="701">And what they will not taste , must yet approve .</l>
     <l n="702">What we admire we praise ; and when we praise</l>
     <l n="703">Advance it into notice , that , its worth</l>
     <l n="704">Acknowledged , others may admire it too .</l>
     <l n="705">I therefore recommend , though at the risk</l>
     <l n="706">Of popular disgust , yet boldly still ,</l>
     <l n="707">The cause of piety and sacred truth</l>
     <l n="708">And virtue , and those scenes which God ordained</l>
     <l n="709">Should best secure them and promote them most ;</l>
     <l n="710">Scenes that I love , and with regret perceive</l>
     <l n="711">Forsaken , or through folly not enjoyed .</l>
     <l n="712">Pure is the nymph , though liberal of her smiles ,</l>
     <l n="713">And chaste , though unconfined , whom I extol .</l>
     <l n="714">Not as the prince in Shushan , when he called ,</l>
     <l n="715">Vain-glorious of her charms , his Vashti forth ,</l>
     <l n="716">To grace the full pavilion . His design</l>
     <l n="717">Was but to boast his own peculiar good ,</l>
     <l n="718">Which all might view with envy , none partake .</l>
     <l n="719">My charmer is not mine alone ; my sweets ,</l>
     <l n="720">And she that sweetens all my bitters , too ,</l>
     <l n="721">Nature , enchanting Nature , in whose form</l>
     <l n="722">And lineaments divine I trace a hand</l>
     <l n="723">That errs not , and find raptures still renewed ,</l>
     <l n="724">Is free to all men — universal prize .</l>
     <l n="725">Strange that so fair a creature should yet want</l>
     <l n="726">Admirers , and be destined to divide</l>
     <l n="727">With meaner objects even the few she finds .</l>
     <l n="728">Stript of her ornaments , her leaves and flowers ,</l>
     <l n="729">She loses all her influence . Cities then</l>
     <l n="730">Attract us , and neglected Nature pines ,</l>
     <l n="731">Abandoned , as unworthy of our love .</l>
     <l n="732">But are not wholesome airs , though unperfumed</l>
     <l n="733">By roses , and clear suns , though scarcely felt ,</l>
     <l n="734">And groves , if unharmonious yet secure</l>
     <l n="735">From clamour and whose very silence charms ,</l>
     <l n="736">To be preferred to smoke — to the eclipse</l>
     <l n="737">That Metropolitan volcanoes make ,</l>
     <l n="738">Whose Stygian throats breathe darkness all day long ,</l>
     <l n="739">And to the stir of commerce , driving slow ,</l>
     <l n="740">And thundering loud with his ten thousand wheels ?</l>
     <l n="741">They would be , were not madness in the head</l>
     <l n="742">And folly in the heart ; were England now</l>
     <l n="743">What England was , plain , hospitable , kind ,</l>
     <l n="744">And undebauched . But we have bid farewell</l>
     <l n="745">To all the virtues of those better days ,</l>
     <l n="746">And all their honest pleasures . Mansions once</l>
     <l n="747">Knew their own masters , and laborious hands</l>
     <l n="748">That had survived the father , served the son .</l>
     <l n="749">Now the legitimate and rightful lord</l>
     <l n="750">Is but a transient guest , newly arrived</l>
     <l n="751">And soon to be supplanted . He that saw</l>
     <l n="752">His patrimonial timber cast its leaf ,</l>
     <l n="753">Sells the last scantling , and transfers the price</l>
     <l n="754">To some shrewd sharper , ere it buds again .</l>
     <l n="755">Estates are landscapes , gazed upon awhile ,</l>
     <l n="756">Then advertised , and auctioneered away .</l>
     <l n="757">The country starves , and they that feed the o'er-charged</l>
     <l n="758">And surfeited lewd town with her fair dues ,</l>
     <l n="759">By a just judgment strip and starve themselves .</l>
     <l n="760">The wings that waft our riches out of sight</l>
     <l n="761">Grow on the gamester 's elbows , and the alert</l>
     <l n="762">And nimble motion of those restless joints ,</l>
     <l n="763">That never tire , soon fans them all away .</l>
     <l n="764">Improvement too , the idol of the age ,</l>
     <l n="765">Is fed with many a victim . Lo ! he comes —</l>
     <l n="766">The omnipotent magician , Brown , appears .</l>
     <l n="767">Down falls the venerable pile , the abode</l>
     <l n="768">Of our forefathers , a grave whiskered race ,</l>
     <l n="769">But tasteless . Springs a palace in its stead ,</l>
     <l n="770">But in a distant spot ; where more exposed</l>
     <l n="771">It may enjoy the advantage of the North</l>
     <l n="772">And aguish East , till time shall have transformed</l>
     <l n="773">Those naked acres to a sheltering grove .</l>
     <l n="774">He speaks . The lake in front becomes a lawn ,</l>
     <l n="775">Woods vanish , hills subside , and valleys rise ,</l>
     <l n="776">And streams , as if created for his use ,</l>
     <l n="777">Pursue the track of his directed wand</l>
     <l n="778">Sinuous or straight , now rapid and now slow ,</l>
     <l n="779">Now murmuring soft , now roaring in cascades ,</l>
     <l n="780">Even as he bids . The enraptured owner smiles .</l>
     <l n="781">‘ Tis finished . And yet , finished as it seems ,</l>
     <l n="782">Still wants a grace , the loveliest it could show ,</l>
     <l n="783">A mine to satisfy the enormous cost .</l>
     <l n="784">Drained to the last poor item of his wealth ,</l>
     <l n="785">He sighs , departs , and leaves the accomplished plan</l>
     <l n="786">That he has touched and retouched , many a day</l>
     <l n="787">Laboured , and many a night pursued in dreams ,</l>
     <l n="788">Just when it meets his hopes , and proves the heaven</l>
     <l n="789">He wanted , for a wealthier to enjoy .</l>
     <l n="790">And now perhaps the glorious hour is come ,</l>
     <l n="791">When having no stake left , no pledge to endear</l>
     <l n="792">Her interests , or that gives her sacred cause</l>
     <l n="793">A moment 's operation on his love ,</l>
     <l n="794">He burns with most intense and flagrant zeal</l>
     <l n="795">To serve his country . Ministerial grace</l>
     <l n="796">Deals him out money from the public chest ,</l>
     <l n="797">Or , if that mine be shut , some private purse</l>
     <l n="798">Supplies his need with an usurious loan ,</l>
     <l n="799">To be refunded duly , when his vote ,</l>
     <l n="800">Well-managed , shall have earned its worthy price .</l>
     <l n="801">Oh , innocent compared with arts like these ,</l>
     <l n="802">Crape and cocked pistol and the whistling ball</l>
     <l n="803">Sent through the traveller 's temples ! He that finds</l>
     <l n="804">One drop of heaven 's sweet mercy in his cup ,</l>
     <l n="805">Can dig , beg , rot , and perish well-content ,</l>
     <l n="806">So he may wrap himself in honest rags</l>
     <l n="807">At his last gasp ; but could not for a world</l>
     <l n="808">Fish up his dirty and dependent bread</l>
     <l n="809">From pools and ditches of the commonwealth ,</l>
     <l n="810">Sordid and sickening at his own success .</l>

   <p>Ambition , avarice , penury incurred By endless riot , vanity , the lust Of pleasure and variety , despatch , As duly as the swallows disappear , The world of wandering knights and squires to town ; London engulfs them all . The shark is there , And the shark 's prey ; the spendthrift , and the leech That sucks him . There the sycophant , and he That with bare-headed and obsequious bows Begs a warm office , doomed to a cold jail And groat per diem if his patron frown . The levee swarms , as if in golden pomp Were charactered on every statesman 's door , ‘ BATTERED AND BANKRUPT FORTUNES MENDED HERE . ’ These are the charms that sully and eclipse The charms of nature . ‘ Tis the cruel gripe That lean hard-handed poverty inflicts , The hope of better things , the chance to win , The wish to shine , the thirst to be amused , That , at the sound of Winter 's hoary wing , Unpeople all our counties of such herds Of fluttering , loitering , cringing , begging , loose And wanton vagrants , as make London , vast And boundless as it is , a crowded coop .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Oh thou resort and mart of all the earth ,</l>
     <l n="2">Chequered with all complexions of mankind ,</l>
     <l n="3">And spotted with all crimes ; in whom I see</l>
     <l n="4">Much that I love , and more that I admire ,</l>
     <l n="5">And all that I abhor ; thou freckled fair</l>
     <l n="6">That pleases and yet shocks me , I can laugh</l>
     <l n="7">And I can weep , can hope , and can despond ,</l>
     <l n="8">Feel wrath and pity when I think on thee !</l>
     <l n="9">Ten righteous would have saved a city once ,</l>
     <l n="10">And thou hast many righteous .— Well for thee —</l>
     <l n="11">That salt preserves thee ; more corrupted else ,</l>
     <l n="12">And therefore more obnoxious at this hour</l>
     <l n="13">Than Sodom in her day had power to be ,</l>
     <l n="14">For whom God heard his Abram plead in vain .</l>

    <head>THE WINTER EVENING .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Hark ! ‘ tis the twanging horn o'er yonder bridge ,</l>
     <l n="2">That with its wearisome but needful length</l>
     <l n="3">Bestrides the wintry flood , in which the moon</l>
     <l n="4">Sees her unwrinkled face reflected bright ;—</l>
     <l n="5">He comes , the herald of a noisy world ,</l>
     <l n="6">With spattered boots , strapped waist , and frozen locks ,</l>
     <l n="7">News from all nations lumbering at his back .</l>
     <l n="8">True to his charge the close-packed load behind ,</l>
     <l n="9">Yet careless what he brings , his one concern</l>
     <l n="10">Is to conduct it to the destined inn ,</l>
     <l n="11">And , having dropped the expected bag — pass on .</l>
     <l n="12">He whistles as he goes , light-hearted wretch ,</l>
     <l n="13">Cold and yet cheerful : messenger of grief</l>
     <l n="14">Perhaps to thousands , and of joy to some ;</l>
     <l n="15">To him indifferent whether grief or joy .</l>
     <l n="16">Houses in ashes , and the fall of stocks ,</l>
     <l n="17">Births , deaths , and marriages , epistles wet</l>
     <l n="18">With tears that trickled down the writer 's cheeks ,</l>
     <l n="19">Fast as the periods from his fluent quill ,</l>
     <l n="20">Or charged with amorous sighs of absent swains ,</l>
     <l n="21">Or nymphs responsive , equally affect</l>
     <l n="22">His horse and him , unconscious of them all .</l>
     <l n="23">But oh , the important budget ! ushered in</l>
     <l n="24">With such heart-shaking music , who can say</l>
     <l n="25">What are its tidings ? have our troops awaked ?</l>
     <l n="26">Or do they still , as if with opium drugged ,</l>
     <l n="27">Snore to the murmurs of the Atlantic wave ?</l>
     <l n="28">Is India free ? and does she wear her plumed</l>
     <l n="29">And jewelled turban with a smile of peace ,</l>
     <l n="30">Or do we grind her still ? The grand debate ,</l>
     <l n="31">The popular harangue , the tart reply ,</l>
     <l n="32">The logic and the wisdom and the wit</l>
     <l n="33">And the loud laugh — I long to know them all ;</l>
     <l n="34">I burn to set the imprisoned wranglers free ,</l>
     <l n="35">And give them voice and utterance once again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="36">Now stir the fire , and close the shutters fast ,</l>
     <l n="37">Let fall the curtains , wheel the sofa round ,</l>
     <l n="38">And while the bubbling and loud-hissing urn</l>
     <l n="39">Throws up a steamy column , and the cups ,</l>
     <l n="40">That cheer but not inebriate , wait on each ,</l>
     <l n="41">So let us welcome peaceful evening in .</l>
     <l n="42">Not such his evening , who with shining face</l>
     <l n="43">Sweats in the crowded theatre , and squeezed</l>
     <l n="44">And bored with elbow-points through both his sides ,</l>
     <l n="45">Outscolds the ranting actor on the stage ;</l>
     <l n="46">Nor his , who patient stands till his feet throb</l>
     <l n="47">And his head thumps , to feed upon the breath</l>
     <l n="48">Of patriots bursting with heroic rage ,</l>
     <l n="49">Or placemen all tranquillity and smiles .</l>
     <l n="50">This folio of four pages , happy work !</l>
     <l n="51">Which not even critics criticise , that holds</l>
     <l n="52">Inquisitive attention while I read</l>
     <l n="53">Fast bound in chains of silence , which the fair ,</l>
     <l n="54">Though eloquent themselves , yet fear to break ,</l>
     <l n="55">What is it but a map of busy life ,</l>
     <l n="56">Its fluctuations and its vast concerns ?</l>
     <l n="57">Here runs the mountainous and craggy ridge</l>
     <l n="58">That tempts ambition . On the summit , see ,</l>
     <l n="59">The seals of office glitter in his eyes ;</l>
     <l n="60">He climbs , he pants , he grasps them . At his heels ,</l>
     <l n="61">Close at his heels , a demagogue ascends ,</l>
     <l n="62">And with a dextrous jerk soon twists him down</l>
     <l n="63">And wins them , but to lose them in his turn .</l>
     <l n="64">Here rills of oily eloquence , in soft</l>
     <l n="65">Meanders , lubricate the course they take ;</l>
     <l n="66">The modest speaker is ashamed and grieved</l>
     <l n="67">To engross a moment 's notice , and yet begs ,</l>
     <l n="68">Begs a propitious ear for his poor thoughts ,</l>
     <l n="69">However trivial all that he conceives .</l>
     <l n="70">Sweet bashfulness ! it claims , at least , this praise ,</l>
     <l n="71">The dearth of information and good sense</l>
     <l n="72">That it foretells us , always comes to pass .</l>
     <l n="73">Cataracts of declamation thunder here ,</l>
     <l n="74">There forests of no meaning spread the page</l>
     <l n="75">In which all comprehension wanders lost ;</l>
     <l n="76">While fields of pleasantry amuse us there ,</l>
     <l n="77">With merry descants on a nation 's woes .</l>
     <l n="78">The rest appears a wilderness of strange</l>
     <l n="79">But gay confusion ; roses for the cheeks</l>
     <l n="80">And lilies for the brows of faded age ,</l>
     <l n="81">Teeth for the toothless , ringlets for the bald ,</l>
     <l n="82">Heaven , earth , and ocean plundered of their sweets .</l>
     <l n="83">Nectareous essences , Olympian dews ,</l>
     <l n="84">Sermons and city feasts and favourite airs ,</l>
     <l n="85">Ethereal journeys , submarine exploits ,</l>
     <l n="86">And Katterfelto with his hair on end</l>
     <l n="87">At his own wonders , wondering for his bread .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="88">‘ Tis pleasant through the loopholes of retreat</l>
     <l n="89">To peep at such a world ; to see the stir</l>
     <l n="90">Of the great Babel and not feel the crowd ;</l>
     <l n="91">To hear the roar she sends through all her gates</l>
     <l n="92">At a safe distance , where the dying sound</l>
     <l n="93">Falls a soft murmur on the uninjured ear .</l>
     <l n="94">Thus sitting and surveying thus at ease</l>
     <l n="95">The globe and its concerns , I seem advanced</l>
     <l n="96">To some secure and more than mortal height ,</l>
     <l n="97">That liberates and exempts me from them all .</l>
     <l n="98">It turns submitted to my view , turns round</l>
     <l n="99">With all its generations ; I behold</l>
     <l n="100">The tumult and am still . The sound of war</l>
     <l n="101">Has lost its terrors ere it reaches me ;</l>
     <l n="102">Grieves , but alarms me not . I mourn the pride</l>
     <l n="103">And avarice that makes man a wolf to man ;</l>
     <l n="104">Hear the faint echo of those brazen throats</l>
     <l n="105">By which he speaks the language of his heart ,</l>
     <l n="106">And sigh , but never tremble at the sound .</l>
     <l n="107">He travels and expatiates , as the bee</l>
     <l n="108">From flower to flower so he from land to land ;</l>
     <l n="109">The manners , customs , policy of all</l>
     <l n="110">Pay contribution to the store he gleans ,</l>
     <l n="111">He sucks intelligence in every clime ,</l>
     <l n="112">And spreads the honey of his deep research</l>
     <l n="113">At his return — a rich repast for me .</l>
     <l n="114">He travels and I too . I tread his deck ,</l>
     <l n="115">Ascend his topmast , through his peering eyes</l>
     <l n="116">Discover countries , with a kindred heart</l>
     <l n="117">Suffer his woes and share in his escapes ;</l>
     <l n="118">While fancy , like the finger of a clock ,</l>
     <l n="119">Runs the great circuit , and is still at home .</l>

     <l n="120">Oh Winter , ruler of the inverted year ,</l>
     <l n="121">Thy scattered hair with sleet-like ashes filled ,</l>
     <l n="122">Thy breath congealed upon thy lips , thy cheeks</l>
     <l n="123">Fringed with a beard made white with other snows</l>
     <l n="124">Than those of age , thy forehead wrapped in clouds ,</l>
     <l n="125">A leafless branch thy sceptre , and thy throne</l>
     <l n="126">A sliding car indebted to no wheels ,</l>
     <l n="127">But urged by storms along its slippery way ,</l>
     <l n="128">I love thee , all unlovely as thou seem'st ,</l>
     <l n="129">And dreaded as thou art . Thou hold'st the sun</l>
     <l n="130">A prisoner in the yet undawning East ,</l>
     <l n="131">Shortening his journey between morn and noon ,</l>
     <l n="132">And hurrying him , impatient of his stay ,</l>
     <l n="133">Down to the rosy west ; but kindly still</l>
     <l n="134">Compensating his loss with added hours</l>
     <l n="135">Of social converse and instructive ease ,</l>
     <l n="136">And gathering at short notice in one group</l>
     <l n="137">The family dispersed , and fixing thought</l>
     <l n="138">Not less dispersed by daylight and its cares .</l>
     <l n="139">I crown thee king of intimate delights ,</l>
     <l n="140">Fire-side enjoyments , home-born happiness ,</l>
     <l n="141">And all the comforts that the lowly roof</l>
     <l n="142">Of undisturbed retirement , and the hours</l>
     <l n="143">Of long uninterrupted evening know .</l>
     <l n="144">No rattling wheels stop short before these gates ;</l>
     <l n="145">No powdered pert proficients in the art</l>
     <l n="146">Of sounding an alarm , assault these doors</l>
     <l n="147">Till the street rings ; no stationary steeds</l>
     <l n="148">Cough their own knell , while heedless of the sound</l>
     <l n="149">The silent circle fan themselves , and quake :</l>
     <l n="150">But here the needle plies its busy task ,</l>

     <l n="755">That soothe the rich possessor ; much consoled</l>
     <l n="756">That here and there some sprigs of mournful mint ,</l>
     <l n="757">Of nightshade , or valerian , grace the well</l>
     <l n="758">He cultivates . These serve him with a hint</l>
     <l n="759">That Nature lives ; that sight-refreshing green</l>
     <l n="760">Is still the livery she delights to wear ,</l>
     <l n="761">Though sickly samples of the exuberant whole .</l>
     <l n="762">What are the casements lined with creeping herbs ,</l>
     <l n="763">The prouder sashes fronted with a range</l>
     <l n="764">Of orange , myrtle , or the fragrant weed ,</l>
     <l n="765">The Frenchman 's darling ? are they not all proofs</l>
     <l n="766">That man , immured in cities , still retains</l>
     <l n="767">His inborn inextinguishable thirst</l>
     <l n="768">Of rural scenes , compensating his loss</l>
     <l n="769">By supplemental shifts , the best he may ?</l>
     <l n="770">The most unfurnished with the means of life ,</l>
     <l n="771">And they that never pass their brick-wall bounds</l>
     <l n="772">To range the fields , and treat their lungs with air ,</l>
     <l n="773">Yet feel the burning instinct : over-head</l>
     <l n="774">Suspend their crazy boxes planted thick</l>
     <l n="775">And watered duly . There the pitcher stands</l>
     <l n="776">A fragment , and the spoutless tea-pot there ;</l>
     <l n="777">Sad witnesses how close-pent man regrets</l>
     <l n="778">The country , with what ardour he contrives</l>
     <l n="779">A peep at nature , when he can no more .</l>

     <l n="793">To the deliverer of an injured land</l>
     <l n="794">He gives a tongue to enlarge upon , a heart</l>
     <l n="795">To feel , and courage to redress her wrongs ;</l>
     <l n="796">To monarchs dignity , to judges sense ;</l>
     <l n="797">To artists ingenuity and skill ;</l>
     <l n="798">To me an unambitious mind , content</l>
     <l n="799">In the low vale of life , that early felt</l>
     <l n="800">A wish for ease and leisure , and ere long</l>
     <l n="801">Found here that leisure and that ease I wished .</l>

    <head>THE WINTER MORNING WALK .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ Tis morning ; and the sun , with ruddy orb</l>
     <l n="2">Ascending , fires the horizon ; while the clouds ,</l>
     <l n="3">That crowd away before the driving wind ,</l>
     <l n="4">More ardent as the disk emerges more ,</l>
     <l n="5">Resemble most some city in a blaze ,</l>
     <l n="6">Seen through the leafless wood . His slanting ray</l>
     <l n="7">Slides ineffectual down the snowy vale ,</l>
     <l n="8">And , tingeing all with his own rosy hue ,</l>
     <l n="9">From every herb and every spiry blade</l>
     <l n="10">Stretches a length of shadow o'er the field ,</l>
     <l n="11">Mine , spindling into longitude immense ,</l>
     <l n="12">In spite of gravity , and sage remark</l>
     <l n="13">That I myself am but a fleeting shade ,</l>
     <l n="14">Provokes me to a smile . With eye askance</l>
     <l n="15">I view the muscular proportioned limb</l>
     <l n="16">Transformed to a lean shank ; the shapeless pair ,</l>
     <l n="17">As they designed to mock me , at my side</l>
     <l n="18">Take step for step , and , as I near approach</l>
     <l n="19">The cottage , walk along the plastered wall ,</l>
     <l n="20">Preposterous sight , the legs without the man .</l>
     <l n="21">The verdure of the plain lies buried deep</l>
     <l n="22">Beneath the dazzling deluge , and the bents</l>
     <l n="23">And coarser grass upspearing o'er the rest ,</l>
     <l n="24">Of late unsightly and unseen , now shine</l>
     <l n="25">Conspicuous , and , in bright apparel clad ,</l>
     <l n="26">And fledged with icy feathers , nod superb .</l>
     <l n="27">The cattle mourn in corners , where the fence</l>
     <l n="28">Screens them , and seem , half petrified , to sleep</l>
     <l n="29">In unrecumbent sadness . There they wait</l>
     <l n="30">Their wonted fodder , not , like hungering man ,</l>
     <l n="31">Fretful if unsupplied , but silent , meek ,</l>
     <l n="32">And patient of the slow-paced swain 's delay .</l>
     <l n="33">He from the stack carves out the accustomed load ,</l>
     <l n="34">Deep-plunging , and again deep-plunging oft</l>
     <l n="35">His broad keen knife into the solid mass :</l>
     <l n="36">Smooth as a wall the upright remnant stands ,</l>
     <l n="37">With such undeviating and even force</l>
     <l n="38">He severs it away : no needless care ,</l>
     <l n="39">Lest storms should overset the leaning pile</l>
     <l n="40">Deciduous , or its own unbalanced weight .</l>
     <l n="41">Forth goes the woodman , leaving unconcerned</l>
     <l n="42">The cheerful haunts of man , to wield the axe</l>
     <l n="43">And drive the wedge in yonder forest drear ,</l>
     <l n="44">From morn to eve his solitary task .</l>
     <l n="45">Shaggy and lean and shrewd , with pointed ears</l>
     <l n="46">And tail cropped short , half lurcher and half cur ,</l>
     <l n="47">His dog attends him . Close behind his heel</l>
     <l n="48">Now creeps he slow , and now with many a frisk ,</l>
     <l n="49">Wide-scampering , snatches up the drifted snow</l>
     <l n="50">With ivory teeth , or ploughs it with his snout ;</l>
     <l n="51">Then shakes his powdered coat and barks for joy .</l>
     <l n="52">Heedless of all his pranks the sturdy churl</l>
     <l n="53">Moves right toward the mark ; nor stops for aught ,</l>
     <l n="54">But now and then , with pressure of his thumb ,</l>
     <l n="55">To adjust the fragrant charge of a short tube ,</l>
     <l n="56">That fumes beneath his nose ; the trailing cloud</l>
     <l n="57">Streams far behind him , scenting all the air .</l>
     <l n="58">Now from the roost , or from the neighbouring pale ,</l>
     <l n="59">Where , diligent to catch the first faint gleam</l>
     <l n="60">Of smiling day , they gossiped side by side ,</l>
     <l n="61">Come trooping at the housewife 's well-known call</l>
     <l n="62">The feathered tribes domestic ; half on wing ,</l>
     <l n="63">And half on foot , they brush the fleecy flood ,</l>
     <l n="64">Conscious , and fearful of too deep a plunge .</l>
     <l n="65">The sparrows peep , and quit the sheltering eaves</l>
     <l n="66">To seize the fair occasion ; well they eye</l>
     <l n="67">The scattered grain , and , thievishly resolved</l>
     <l n="68">To escape the impending famine , often scared</l>
     <l n="69">As oft return , a pert , voracious kind .</l>
     <l n="70">Clean riddance quickly made , one only care</l>
     <l n="71">Remains to each , the search of sunny nook ,</l>
     <l n="72">Or shed impervious to the blast . Resigned</l>
     <l n="73">To sad necessity the cock foregoes</l>
     <l n="74">His wonted strut , and , wading at their head</l>
     <l n="75">With well-considered steps , seems to resent</l>
     <l n="76">His altered gait , and stateliness retrenched .</l>
     <l n="77">How find the myriads , that in summer cheer</l>
     <l n="78">The hills and valleys with their ceaseless songs ,</l>
     <l n="79">Due sustenance , or where subsist they now ?</l>
     <l n="80">Earth yields them naught : the imprisoned worm is safe</l>
     <l n="81">Beneath the frozen clod ; all seeds of herbs</l>
     <l n="82">Lie covered close , and berry-bearing thorns</l>
     <l n="83">That feed the thrush ( whatever some suppose ) ,</l>
     <l n="84">Afford the smaller minstrel no supply .</l>
     <l n="85">The long-protracted rigour of the year</l>
     <l n="86">Thins all their numerous flocks . In chinks and holes</l>
     <l n="87">Ten thousand seek an unmolested end ,</l>
     <l n="88">As instinct prompts , self-buried ere they die .</l>
     <l n="89">The very rooks and daws forsake the fields ,</l>
     <l n="90">Where neither grub nor root nor earth-nut now</l>
     <l n="91">Repays their labour more ; and perched aloft</l>
     <l n="92">By the way-side , or stalking in the path ,</l>
     <l n="93">Lean pensioners upon the traveller 's track ,</l>
     <l n="94">Pick up their nauseous dole , though sweet to them ,</l>
     <l n="95">Of voided pulse , or half-digested grain .</l>
     <l n="96">The streams are lost amid the splendid blank ,</l>
     <l n="97">O'erwhelming all distinction . On the flood</l>
     <l n="98">Indurated and fixed the snowy weight</l>
     <l n="99">Lies undissolved , while silently beneath</l>
     <l n="100">And unperceived the current steals away ;</l>
     <l n="101">Not so where , scornful of a check , it leaps</l>
     <l n="102">The mill-dam , dashes on the restless wheel ,</l>
     <l n="103">And wantons in the pebbly gulf below .</l>
     <l n="104">No frost can bind it there . Its utmost force</l>
     <l n="105">Can but arrest the light and smoky mist</l>
     <l n="106">That in its fall the liquid sheet throws wide .</l>
     <l n="107">And see where it has hung the embroidered banks</l>
     <l n="108">With forms so various , that no powers of art ,</l>
     <l n="109">The pencil , or the pen , may trace the scene !</l>
     <l n="110">Here glittering turrets rise , upbearing high</l>
     <l n="111">( Fantastic misarrangement ) on the roof</l>
     <l n="112">Large growth of what may seem the sparkling trees</l>
     <l n="113">And shrubs of fairy land . The crystal drops</l>
     <l n="114">That trickle down the branches , fast congealed ,</l>
     <l n="115">Shoot into pillars of pellucid length</l>
     <l n="116">And prop the pile they but adorned before .</l>
     <l n="117">Here grotto within grotto safe defies</l>
     <l n="118">The sunbeam . There imbossed and fretted wild ,</l>
     <l n="119">The growing wonder takes a thousand shapes</l>
     <l n="120">Capricious , in which fancy seeks in vain</l>
     <l n="121">The likeness of some object seen before .</l>
     <l n="122">Thus nature works as if to mock at art ,</l>
     <l n="123">And in defiance of her rival powers ;</l>
     <l n="124">By these fortuitous and random strokes</l>
     <l n="125">Performing such inimitable feats ,</l>
     <l n="126">As she with all her rules can never reach .</l>
     <l n="127">Less worthy of applause though more admired ,</l>
     <l n="128">Because a novelty , the work of man ,</l>
     <l n="129">Imperial mistress of the fur-clad Russ ,</l>
     <l n="130">Thy most magnificent and mighty freak ,</l>
     <l n="131">The wonder of the North . No forest fell</l>
     <l n="132">When thou wouldst build ; no quarry sent its stores</l>
     <l n="133">To enrich thy walls ; but thou didst hew the floods ,</l>
     <l n="134">And make thy marble of the glassy wave .</l>
     <l n="135">In such a palace Aristaeus found</l>
     <l n="136">Cyrene , when he bore the plaintive tale</l>
     <l n="137">Of his lost bees to her maternal ear .</l>
     <l n="138">In such a palace poetry might place</l>
     <l n="139">The armoury of winter , where his troops ,</l>
     <l n="140">The gloomy clouds , find weapons , arrowy sleet ,</l>
     <l n="141">Skin-piercing volley , blossom-bruising hail ,</l>
     <l n="142">And snow that often blinds the traveller 's course ,</l>
     <l n="143">And wraps him in an unexpected tomb .</l>
     <l n="144">Silently as a dream the fabric rose .</l>
     <l n="145">No sound of hammer or of saw was there .</l>
     <l n="146">Ice upon ice , the well-adjusted parts</l>
     <l n="147">Were soon conjoined , nor other cement asked</l>
     <l n="148">Than water interfused to make them one .</l>
     <l n="149">Lamps gracefully disposed , and of all hues ,</l>
     <l n="150">Illumined every side . A watery light</l>
     <l n="151">Gleamed through the clear transparency , that seemed</l>
     <l n="152">Another moon new-risen , or meteor fallen</l>
     <l n="153">From heaven to earth , of lambent flame serene .</l>
     <l n="154">So stood the brittle prodigy , though smooth</l>
     <l n="155">And slippery the materials , yet frost-bound</l>
     <l n="156">Firm as a rock . Nor wanted aught within</l>
     <l n="157">That royal residence might well befit ,</l>
     <l n="158">For grandeur or for use . Long wavy wreaths</l>
     <l n="159">Of flowers , that feared no enemy but warmth ,</l>
     <l n="160">Blushed on the panels . Mirror needed none</l>
     <l n="161">Where all was vitreous , but in order due</l>
     <l n="162">Convivial table and commodious seat</l>
     <l n="163">( What seemed at least commodious seat ) were there ,</l>
     <l n="164">Sofa and couch and high-built throne august .</l>
     <l n="165">The same lubricity was found in all ,</l>
     <l n="166">And all was moist to the warm touch ; a scene</l>
     <l n="167">Of evanescent glory , once a stream ,</l>
     <l n="168">And soon to slide into a stream again .</l>
     <l n="169">Alas , ‘ twas but a mortifying stroke</l>
     <l n="170">Of undesigned severity , that glanced</l>
     <l n="171">( Made by a monarch ) on her own estate ,</l>
     <l n="172">On human grandeur and the courts of kings</l>
     <l n="173">‘ Twas transient in its nature , as in show</l>
     <l n="174">‘ Twas durable ; as worthless , as it seemed</l>
     <l n="175">Intrinsically precious ; to the foot</l>
     <l n="176">Treacherous and false ; it smiled , and it was cold .</l>

     <l n="193">When Babel was confounded , and the great</l>
     <l n="194">Confederacy of projectors wild and vain</l>
     <l n="195">Was split into diversity of tongues ,</l>
     <l n="196">Then , as a shepherd separates his flock ,</l>
     <l n="197">These to the upland , to the valley those ,</l>
     <l n="198">God drave asunder and assigned their lot</l>
     <l n="199">To all the nations . Ample was the boon</l>
     <l n="200">He gave them , in its distribution fair</l>
     <l n="201">And equal , and he bade them dwell in peace .</l>
     <l n="202">Peace was a while their care . They ploughed and sowed ,</l>
     <l n="203">And reaped their plenty without grudge or strife ,</l>
     <l n="204">But violence can never longer sleep</l>
     <l n="205">Than human passions please . In every heart</l>
     <l n="206">Are sown the sparks that kindle fiery war ,</l>
     <l n="207">Occasion needs but fan them , and they blaze .</l>
     <l n="208">Cain had already shed a brother 's blood :</l>
     <l n="209">The Deluge washed it out ; but left unquenched</l>

     <l n="211">Soon , by a righteous judgment , in the line</l>
     <l n="212">Of his descending progeny was found</l>
     <l n="213">The first artificer of death ; the shrewd</l>
     <l n="214">Contriver who first sweated at the forge ,</l>
     <l n="215">And forced the blunt and yet unblooded steel</l>
     <l n="216">To a keen edge , and made it bright for war .</l>
     <l n="217">Him Tubal named , the Vulcan of old times ,</l>
     <l n="218">The sword and falchion their inventor claim ,</l>
     <l n="219">And the first smith was the first murderer 's son .</l>
     <l n="220">His art survived the waters ; and ere long ,</l>
     <l n="221">When man was multiplied and spread abroad</l>
     <l n="222">In tribes and clans , and had begun to call</l>
     <l n="223">These meadows and that range of hills his own ,</l>
     <l n="224">The tasted sweets of property begat</l>
     <l n="225">Desire of more ; and industry in some</l>
     <l n="226">To improve and cultivate their just demesne ,</l>
     <l n="227">Made others covet what they saw so fair .</l>
     <l n="228">Thus wars began on earth . These fought for spoil ,</l>
     <l n="229">And those in self-defence . Savage at first</l>

     <l n="237">As he , whose prowess had subdued their foes ?</l>
     <l n="238">Thus war , affording field for the display</l>

     <l n="248">And destitute of means to raise themselves ,</l>
     <l n="249">They sink and settle lower than they need .</l>
     <l n="250">They know not what it is to feel within</l>
     <l n="251">A comprehensive faculty , that grasps</l>
     <l n="252">Great purposes with ease , that turns and wields ,</l>
     <l n="253">Almost without an effort , plans too vast</l>
     <l n="254">For their conception , which they cannot move .</l>
     <l n="255">Conscious of impotence they soon grow drunk</l>
     <l n="256">With gazing , when they see an able man</l>

     <l n="486">The uninformed and heedless souls of men .</l>
     <l n="487">We give to chance , blind chance , ourselves as blind ,</l>
     <l n="488">The glory of Thy work , which yet appears</l>
     <l n="489">Perfect and unimpeachable of blame ,</l>
     <l n="490">Challenging human scrutiny , and proved</l>
     <l n="491">Then skilful most when most severely judged .</l>
     <l n="492">But chance is not ; or is not where Thou reign'st :</l>
     <l n="493">Thy providence forbids that fickle power</l>
     <l n="494">( If power she be that works but to confound )</l>
     <l n="495">To mix her wild vagaries with Thy laws .</l>
     <l n="496">Yet thus we dote , refusing , while we can ,</l>
     <l n="497">Instruction , and inventing to ourselves</l>
     <l n="498">Gods such as guilt makes welcome — gods that sleep ,</l>
     <l n="499">Or disregard our follies , or that sit</l>
     <l n="500">Amused spectators of this bustling stage .</l>
     <l n="501">Thee we reject , unable to abide</l>
     <l n="502">Thy purity , till pure as Thou art pure ,</l>
     <l n="503">Made such by Thee , we love Thee for that cause</l>
     <l n="504">For which we shunned and hated Thee before .</l>
     <l n="505">Then we are free : then liberty , like day ,</l>
     <l n="506">Breaks on the soul , and by a flash from heaven</l>
     <l n="507">Fires all the faculties with glorious joy .</l>
     <l n="508">A voice is heard that mortal ears hear not</l>
     <l n="509">Till Thou hast touched them ; ‘ tis the voice of song ,</l>
     <l n="510">A loud Hosanna sent from all Thy works ,</l>
     <l n="511">Which he that hears it with a shout repeats ,</l>
     <l n="512">And adds his rapture to the general praise .</l>
     <l n="513">In that blest moment , Nature , throwing wide</l>
     <l n="514">Her veil opaque , discloses with a smile</l>
     <l n="515">The Author of her beauties , who , retired</l>
     <l n="516">Behind His own creation , works unseen</l>
     <l n="517">By the impure , and hears His power denied .</l>
     <l n="518">Thou art the source and centre of all minds ,</l>
     <l n="519">Their only point of rest , eternal Word !</l>
     <l n="520">From Thee departing , they are lost and rove</l>
     <l n="521">At random , without honour , hope , or peace .</l>
     <l n="522">From Thee is all that soothes the life of man ,</l>
     <l n="523">His high endeavour , and his glad success ,</l>
     <l n="524">His strength to suffer , and his will to serve .</l>
     <l n="525">But , oh , Thou Bounteous Giver of all good ,</l>
     <l n="526">Thou art of all Thy gifts Thyself the crown !</l>
     <l n="527">Give what Thou canst , without Thee we are poor ,</l>
     <l n="528">And with Thee rich , take what Thou wilt away .</l>

    <head>THE WINTER WALK AT NOON .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">There is in souls a sympathy with sounds ,</l>
     <l n="2">And as the mind is pitched the ear is pleased</l>
     <l n="3">With melting airs or martial , brisk or grave ;</l>
     <l n="4">Some chord in unison with what we hear</l>
     <l n="5">Is touched within us , and the heart replies .</l>
     <l n="6">How soft the music of those village bells</l>
     <l n="7">Falling at intervals upon the ear</l>
     <l n="8">In cadence sweet , now dying all away ,</l>
     <l n="9">Now pealing loud again , and louder still ,</l>
     <l n="10">Clear and sonorous as the gale comes on .</l>
     <l n="11">With easy force it opens all the cells</l>
     <l n="12">Where memory slept . Wherever I have heard</l>
     <l n="13">A kindred melody , the scene recurs ,</l>
     <l n="14">And with it all its pleasures and its pains .</l>
     <l n="15">Such comprehensive views the spirit takes ,</l>
     <l n="16">That in a few short moments I retrace</l>
     <l n="17">( As in a map the voyager his course )</l>
     <l n="18">The windings of my way through many years .</l>
     <l n="19">Short as in retrospect the journey seems ,</l>
     <l n="20">It seemed not always short ; the rugged path ,</l>
     <l n="21">And prospect oft so dreary and forlorn ,</l>
     <l n="22">Moved many a sigh at its disheartening length .</l>
     <l n="23">Yet feeling present evils , while the past</l>
     <l n="24">Faintly impress the mind , or not at all ,</l>
     <l n="25">How readily we wish time spent revoked ,</l>
     <l n="26">That we might try the ground again , where once</l>
     <l n="27">( Through inexperience as we now perceive )</l>
     <l n="28">We missed that happiness we might have found .</l>
     <l n="29">Some friend is gone , perhaps his son 's best friend</l>
     <l n="30">A father , whose authority , in show</l>
     <l n="31">When most severe , and mustering all its force ,</l>
     <l n="32">Was but the graver countenance of love ;</l>
     <l n="33">Whose favour , like the clouds of spring , might lower ,</l>
     <l n="34">And utter now and then an awful voice ,</l>
     <l n="35">But had a blessing in its darkest frown ,</l>
     <l n="36">Threatening at once and nourishing the plant .</l>
     <l n="37">We loved , but not enough , the gentle hand</l>
     <l n="38">That reared us . At a thoughtless age allured</l>
     <l n="39">By every gilded folly , we renounced</l>
     <l n="40">His sheltering side , and wilfully forewent</l>
     <l n="41">That converse which we now in vain regret .</l>
     <l n="42">How gladly would the man recall to life</l>
     <l n="43">The boy 's neglected sire ! a mother too ,</l>
     <l n="44">That softer friend , perhaps more gladly still ,</l>
     <l n="45">Might he demand them at the gates of death .</l>
     <l n="46">Sorrow has since they went subdued and tamed</l>
     <l n="47">The playful humour ; he could now endure</l>
     <l n="48">( Himself grown sober in the vale of tears )</l>
     <l n="49">And feel a parent 's presence no restraint .</l>
     <l n="50">But not to understand a treasure 's worth</l>
     <l n="51">Till time has stolen away the slighted good ,</l>
     <l n="52">Is cause of half the poverty we feel ,</l>
     <l n="53">And makes the world the wilderness it is .</l>
     <l n="54">The few that pray at all , pray oft amiss ,</l>
     <l n="55">And , seeking grace to improve the prize they hold ,</l>
     <l n="56">Would urge a wiser suit than asking more .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="57">The night was winter in his roughest mood ,</l>
     <l n="58">The morning sharp and clear ; but now at noon</l>
     <l n="59">Upon the southern side of the slant hills ,</l>
     <l n="60">And where the woods fence off the northern blast ,</l>
     <l n="61">The season smiles , resigning all its rage ,</l>
     <l n="62">And has the warmth of May . The vault is blue</l>
     <l n="63">Without a cloud , and white without a speck</l>
     <l n="64">The dazzling splendour of the scene below .</l>
     <l n="65">Again the harmony comes o'er the vale ,</l>
     <l n="66">And through the trees I view the embattled tower</l>
     <l n="67">Whence all the music . I again perceive</l>
     <l n="68">The soothing influence of the wafted strains ,</l>
     <l n="69">And settle in soft musings , as I tread</l>
     <l n="70">The walk still verdant under oaks and elms ,</l>
     <l n="71">Whose outspread branches overarch the glade .</l>
     <l n="72">The roof , though movable through all its length ,</l>
     <l n="73">As the wind sways it , has yet well sufficed ,</l>
     <l n="74">And , intercepting in their silent fall</l>
     <l n="75">The frequent flakes , has kept a path for me .</l>
     <l n="76">No noise is here , or none that hinders thought :</l>
     <l n="77">The redbreast warbles still , but is content</l>
     <l n="78">With slender notes and more than half suppressed .</l>
     <l n="79">Pleased with his solitude , and flitting light</l>
     <l n="80">From spray to spray , where'er he rests he shakes</l>
     <l n="81">From many a twig the pendant drops of ice ,</l>
     <l n="82">That tinkle in the withered leaves below .</l>
     <l n="83">Stillness , accompanied with sounds so soft ,</l>
     <l n="84">Charms more than silence . Meditation here</l>
     <l n="85">May think down hours to moments . Here the heart</l>
     <l n="86">May give an useful lesson to the head ,</l>
     <l n="87">And learning wiser grow without his books .</l>
     <l n="88">Knowledge and wisdom , far from being one ,</l>
     <l n="89">Have ofttimes no connection . Knowledge dwells</l>
     <l n="90">In heads replete with thoughts of other men ;</l>
     <l n="91">Wisdom in minds attentive to their own .</l>
     <l n="92">Knowledge , a rude unprofitable mass ,</l>
     <l n="93">The mere materials with which wisdom builds ,</l>
     <l n="94">Till smoothed and squared and fitted to its place ,</l>
     <l n="95">Does but encumber whom it seems to enrich .</l>
     <l n="96">Knowledge is proud that he has learned so much ,</l>
     <l n="97">Wisdom is humble that he knows no more .</l>
     <l n="98">Books are not seldom talismans and spells</l>
     <l n="99">By which the magic art of shrewder wits</l>
     <l n="100">Holds an unthinking multitude enthralled .</l>
     <l n="101">Some to the fascination of a name</l>
     <l n="102">Surrender judgment hoodwinked . Some the style</l>
     <l n="103">Infatuates , and , through labyrinths and wilds</l>
     <l n="104">Of error , leads them by a tune entranced .</l>
     <l n="105">While sloth seduces more , too weak to bear</l>
     <l n="106">The insupportable fatigue of thought ,</l>
     <l n="107">And swallowing therefore without pause or choice</l>
     <l n="108">The total grist unsifted , husks and all .</l>
     <l n="109">But trees , and rivulets whose rapid course</l>
     <l n="110">Defies the check of winter , haunts of deer ,</l>
     <l n="111">And sheep-walks populous with bleating lambs ,</l>
     <l n="112">And lanes , in which the primrose ere her time</l>
     <l n="113">Peeps through the moss that clothes the hawthorn root ,</l>
     <l n="114">Deceive no student . Wisdom there , and truth ,</l>
     <l n="115">Not shy as in the world , and to be won</l>
     <l n="116">By slow solicitation , seize at once</l>
     <l n="117">The roving thought , and fix it on themselves .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="118">What prodigies can power divine perform</l>
     <l n="119">More grand than it produces year by year ,</l>
     <l n="120">And all in sight of inattentive man ?</l>
     <l n="121">Familiar with the effect we slight the cause ,</l>
     <l n="122">And in the constancy of Nature 's course ,</l>
     <l n="123">The regular return of genial months ,</l>
     <l n="124">And renovation of a faded world ,</l>
     <l n="125">See nought to wonder at . Should God again ,</l>
     <l n="126">As once in Gibeon , interrupt the race</l>
     <l n="127">Of the undeviating and punctual sun ,</l>
     <l n="128">How would the world admire ! but speaks it less</l>
     <l n="129">An agency divine , to make him know</l>
     <l n="130">His moment when to sink and when to rise</l>
     <l n="131">Age after age , than to arrest his course ?</l>
     <l n="132">All we behold is miracle : but , seen</l>
     <l n="133">So duly , all is miracle in vain .</l>
     <l n="134">Where now the vital energy that moved ,</l>
     <l n="135">While summer was , the pure and subtle lymph</l>
     <l n="136">Through the imperceptible meandering veins</l>
     <l n="137">Of leaf and flower ? It sleeps : and the icy touch</l>
     <l n="138">Of unprolific winter has impressed</l>
     <l n="139">A cold stagnation on the intestine tide .</l>
     <l n="140">But let the months go round , a few short months ,</l>
     <l n="141">And all shall be restored . These naked shoots ,</l>
     <l n="142">Barren as lances , among which the wind</l>
     <l n="143">Makes wintry music , sighing as it goes ,</l>
     <l n="144">Shall put their graceful foliage on again ,</l>
     <l n="145">And more aspiring and with ampler spread</l>
     <l n="146">Shall boast new charms , and more than they have lost .</l>
     <l n="147">Then , each in its peculiar honours clad ,</l>
     <l n="148">Shall publish even to the distant eye</l>
     <l n="149">Its family and tribe . Laburnum rich</l>
     <l n="150">In streaming gold ; syringa ivory pure ;</l>
     <l n="151">The scented and the scentless rose ; this red</l>
     <l n="152">And of a humbler growth , the other tall ,</l>
     <l n="153">And throwing up into the darkest gloom</l>
     <l n="154">Of neighbouring cypress , or more sable yew ,</l>
     <l n="155">Her silver globes , light as the foamy surf</l>
     <l n="156">That the wind severs from the broken wave ;</l>
     <l n="157">The lilac various in array , now white ,</l>
     <l n="158">Now sanguine , and her beauteous head now set</l>
     <l n="159">With purple spikes pyramidal , as if</l>
     <l n="160">Studious of ornament , yet unresolved</l>
     <l n="161">Which hue she most approved , she chose them all ;</l>
     <l n="162">Copious of flowers the woodbine , pale and wan ,</l>
     <l n="163">But well compensating their sickly looks</l>
     <l n="164">With never-cloying odours , early and late ;</l>
     <l n="165">Hypericum all bloom , so thick a swarm</l>
     <l n="166">Of flowers like flies , clothing her slender rods ,</l>
     <l n="167">That scarce a leaf appears ; mezereon too ,</l>
     <l n="168">Though leafless , well attired , and thick beset</l>
     <l n="169">With blushing wreaths investing every spray ;</l>
     <l n="170">Althaea with the purple eye ; the broom ,</l>
     <l n="171">Yellow and bright as bullion unalloyed</l>
     <l n="172">Her blossoms ; and luxuriant above all</l>
     <l n="173">The jasmine , throwing wide her elegant sweets ,</l>
     <l n="174">The deep dark green of whose unvarnished leaf</l>
     <l n="175">Makes more conspicuous , and illumines more</l>
     <l n="176">The bright profusion of her scattered stars .—</l>
     <l n="177">These have been , and these shall be in their day ,</l>
     <l n="178">And all this uniform uncoloured scene</l>
     <l n="179">Shall be dismantled of its fleecy load ,</l>
     <l n="180">And flush into variety again .</l>
     <l n="181">From dearth to plenty , and from death to life ,</l>
     <l n="182">Is Nature 's progress when she lectures man</l>
     <l n="183">In heavenly truth ; evincing , as she makes</l>
     <l n="184">The grand transition , that there lives and works</l>
     <l n="185">A soul in all things , and that soul is God .</l>
     <l n="186">The beauties of the wilderness are His ,</l>
     <l n="187">That make so gay the solitary place</l>
     <l n="188">Where no eye sees them . And the fairer forms</l>
     <l n="189">That cultivation glories in , are His .</l>
     <l n="190">He sets the bright procession on its way ,</l>
     <l n="191">And marshals all the order of the year .</l>
     <l n="192">He marks the bounds which Winter may not pass ,</l>
     <l n="193">And blunts his pointed fury . In its case ,</l>
     <l n="194">Russet and rude , folds up the tender germ</l>
     <l n="195">Uninjured , with inimitable art ,</l>
     <l n="196">And , ere one flowery season fades and dies ,</l>
     <l n="197">Designs the blooming wonders of the next .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="198">Some say that in the origin of things ,</l>
     <l n="199">When all creation started into birth ,</l>
     <l n="200">The infant elements received a law</l>
     <l n="201">From which they swerve not since ; that under force</l>
     <l n="202">Of that controlling ordinance they move ,</l>
     <l n="203">And need not His immediate hand , who first</l>
     <l n="204">Prescribed their course , to regulate it now .</l>
     <l n="205">Thus dream they , and contrive to save a God</l>
     <l n="206">The encumbrance of His own concerns , and spare</l>
     <l n="207">The great Artificer of all that moves</l>
     <l n="208">The stress of a continual act , the pain</l>
     <l n="209">Of unremitted vigilance and care ,</l>
     <l n="210">As too laborious and severe a task .</l>
     <l n="211">So man the moth is not afraid , it seems ,</l>

     <l n="222">Sustains and is the life of all that lives .</l>
     <l n="223">Nature is but a name for an effect</l>
     <l n="224">Whose cause is God . He feeds the secret fire</l>
     <l n="225">By which the mighty process is maintained ,</l>

     <l n="241">But shows some touch in freckle , streak , or stain ,</l>
     <l n="242">Of His unrivalled pencil . He inspires</l>
     <l n="243">Their balmy odours and imparts their hues ,</l>
     <l n="244">And bathes their eyes with nectar , and includes ,</l>
     <l n="245">In grains as countless as the sea-side sands ,</l>

     <l n="47">Thy saints proclaim Thee King ; and Thy delay</l>
     <l n="48">Gives courage to their foes , who , could they see</l>
     <l n="49">The dawn of Thy last advent , long-desired ,</l>
     <l n="50">Would creep into the bowels of the hills ,</l>
     <l n="51">And flee for safety to the falling rocks .</l>
     <l n="52">The very spirit of the world is tired</l>
     <l n="53">Of its own taunting question , asked so long ,</l>
     <l n="54">“ Where is the promise of your Lord 's approach ? ”</l>
     <l n="55">The infidel has shot his bolts away ,</l>
     <l n="56">Till , his exhausted quiver yielding none ,</l>
     <l n="57">He gleans the blunted shafts that have recoiled ,</l>
     <l n="58">And aims them at the shield of truth again .</l>
     <l n="59">The veil is rent , rent too by priestly hands ,</l>
     <l n="60">That hides divinity from mortal eyes ;</l>
     <l n="61">And all the mysteries to faith proposed ,</l>
     <l n="62">Insulted and traduced , are cast aside ,</l>
     <l n="63">As useless , to the moles and to the bats .</l>
     <l n="64">They now are deemed the faithful and are praised ,</l>
     <l n="65">Who , constant only in rejecting Thee ,</l>
     <l n="66">Deny Thy Godhead with a martyr 's zeal ,</l>
     <l n="67">And quit their office for their error 's sake .</l>
     <l n="68">Blind and in love with darkness ! yet even these</l>
     <l n="69">Worthy , compared with sycophants , who kneel ,</l>
     <l n="70">Thy Name adoring , and then preach Thee man !</l>
     <l n="71">So fares Thy Church . But how Thy Church may fare ,</l>
     <l n="72">The world takes little thought ; who will may preach ,</l>
     <l n="73">And what they will . All pastors are alike</l>
     <l n="74">To wandering sheep resolved to follow none .</l>
     <l n="75">Two gods divide them all , Pleasure and Gain ;</l>
     <l n="76">For these they live , they sacrifice to these ,</l>
     <l n="77">And in their service wage perpetual war</l>
     <l n="78">With conscience and with Thee . Lust in their hearts ,</l>
     <l n="79">And mischief in their hands , they roam the earth</l>
     <l n="80">To prey upon each other ; stubborn , fierce ,</l>
     <l n="81">High-minded , foaming out their own disgrace .</l>
     <l n="82">Thy prophets speak of such ; and noting down</l>
     <l n="83">The features of the last degenerate times ,</l>
     <l n="84">Exhibit every lineament of these .</l>
     <l n="85">Come then , and added to Thy many crowns</l>
     <l n="86">Receive yet one as radiant as the rest ,</l>
     <l n="87">Due to Thy last and most effectual work ,</l>
     <l n="88">Thy Word fulfilled , the conquest of a world .</l>

     <l n="89">He is the happy man , whose life even now</l>
     <l n="90">Shows somewhat of that happier life to come ;</l>
     <l n="91">Who , doomed to an obscure but tranquil state ,</l>
     <l n="92">Is pleased with it , and , were he free to choose ,</l>
     <l n="93">Would make his fate his choice ; whom peace , the fruit</l>

     <l n="95">Prepare for happiness ; bespeak him one</l>
     <l n="96">Content indeed to sojourn while he must</l>
     <l n="97">Below the skies , but having there his home .</l>
     <l n="98">The world o'erlooks him in her busy search</l>
     <l n="99">Of objects more illustrious in her view ;</l>
     <l n="100">And occupied as earnestly as she ,</l>
     <l n="101">Though more sublimely , he o'erlooks the world .</l>

     <l n="104">He cannot skim the ground like summer birds</l>

     <l n="106">Her honours , her emoluments , her joys ;</l>
     <l n="107">Therefore in contemplation is his bliss ,</l>
     <l n="108">Whose power is such , that whom she lifts from earth</l>
     <l n="109">She makes familiar with a heaven unseen ,</l>
     <l n="110">And shows him glories yet to be revealed .</l>
     <l n="111">Not slothful he , though seeming unemployed ,</l>
     <l n="112">And censured oft as useless . Stillest streams</l>
     <l n="113">Oft water fairest meadows ; and the bird</l>
     <l n="114">That flutters least is longest on the wing .</l>
     <l n="115">Ask him , indeed , what trophies he has raised ,</l>
     <l n="116">Or what achievements of immortal fame</l>
     <l n="117">He purposes , and he shall answer — None .</l>
     <l n="118">His warfare is within . There unfatigued</l>
     <l n="119">His fervent spirit labours . There he fights ,</l>
     <l n="120">And there obtains fresh triumphs o'er himself ,</l>
     <l n="121">And never-withering wreaths , compared with which</l>
     <l n="122">The laurels that a Caesar reaps are weeds .</l>
     <l n="123">Perhaps the self-approving haughty world ,</l>
     <l n="124">That , as she sweeps him with her whistling silks ,</l>
     <l n="125">Scarce deigns to notice him , or if she see ,</l>
     <l n="126">Deems him a cipher in the works of God ,</l>
     <l n="127">Receives advantage from his noiseless hours</l>
     <l n="128">Of which she little dreams . Perhaps she owes</l>
     <l n="129">Her sunshine and her rain , her blooming spring</l>
     <l n="130">And plenteous harvest , to the prayer he makes</l>
     <l n="131">When , Isaac-like , the solitary saint</l>
     <l n="132">Walks forth to meditate at eventide ,</l>
     <l n="133">And think on her who thinks not for herself .</l>
     <l n="134">Forgive him then , thou bustler in concerns</l>
     <l n="135">Of little worth , and idler in the best ,</l>
     <l n="136">If , author of no mischief and some good ,</l>
     <l n="137">He seeks his proper happiness by means</l>
     <l n="138">That may advance , but cannot hinder thine .</l>
     <l n="139">Nor , though he tread the secret path of life ,</l>
     <l n="140">Engage no notice , and enjoy much ease ,</l>
     <l n="141">Account him an encumbrance on the state ,</l>

     <l n="144">Shine with his fair example , and though small</l>
     <l n="145">His influence , if that influence all be spent</l>
     <l n="146">In soothing sorrow and in quenching strife ,</l>
     <l n="147">In aiding helpless indigence , in works</l>
     <l n="148">From which at least a grateful few derive</l>
     <l n="149">Some taste of comfort in a world of woe ,</l>
     <l n="150">Then let the supercilious great confess</l>
     <l n="151">He serves his country ; recompenses well</l>
     <l n="152">The state beneath the shadow of whose vine</l>
     <l n="153">He sits secure , and in the scale of life</l>
     <l n="154">Holds no ignoble , though a slighted place .</l>
     <l n="155">The man whose virtues are more felt than seen ,</l>
     <l n="156">Must drop , indeed , the hope of public praise ;</l>
     <l n="157">But he may boast , what few that win it can ,</l>
     <l n="158">That if his country stand not by his skill ,</l>
     <l n="159">At least his follies have not wrought her fall .</l>
     <l n="160">Polite refinement offers him in vain</l>
     <l n="161">Her golden tube , through which a sensual world</l>
     <l n="162">Draws gross impurity , and likes it well ,</l>
     <l n="163">The neat conveyance hiding all the offence .</l>
     <l n="164">Not that he peevishly rejects a mode</l>
     <l n="165">Because that world adopts it . If it bear</l>
     <l n="166">The stamp and clear impression of good sense ,</l>
     <l n="167">And be not costly more than of true worth ,</l>
     <l n="168">He puts it on , and for decorum sake</l>
     <l n="169">Can wear it e'en as gracefully as she .</l>
     <l n="170">She judges of refinement by the eye ,</l>
     <l n="171">He by the test of conscience , and a heart</l>
     <l n="172">Not soon deceived ; aware that what is base</l>
     <l n="173">No polish can make sterling , and that vice ,</l>
     <l n="174">Though well-perfumed and elegantly dressed ,</l>
     <l n="175">Like an unburied carcass tricked with flowers ,</l>
     <l n="176">Is but a garnished nuisance , fitter far</l>
     <l n="177">For cleanly riddance than for fair attire .</l>
     <l n="178">So life glides smoothly and by stealth away ,</l>
     <l n="179">More golden than that age of fabled gold</l>
     <l n="180">Renowned in ancient song ; not vexed with care ,</l>
     <l n="181">Or stained with guilt , beneficent , approved</l>

     <l n="183">So glide my life away ! and so at last ,</l>

     <l n="186">Its destined office , yet with gentle stroke ,</l>

     <l n="193">Whom flowers alone I knew would little please ,</l>
     <l n="194">Let fall the unfinished wreath , and roved for fruit ;</l>
     <l n="195">Roved far and gathered much ; some harsh , ‘ tis true ,</l>

     <l n="200">But all is in His hand whose praise I seek ,</l>
     <l n="201">In vain the poet sings , and the world hears ,</l>
     <l n="202">If He regard not , though divine the theme .</l>

     <l n="204">And idle tinkling of a minstrel 's lyre ,</l>
     <l n="205">To charm His ear , whose eye is on the heart ;</l>

    <head>THE DIVERTING HISTORY OF JOHN GILPIN ;</head>
    <head>SHOWING HOW HE WENT FARTHER THAN HE INTENDED , AND CAME SAFE HOME AGAIN .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">John Gilpin was a citizen</l>
     <l n="2">Of credit and renown ,</l>
     <l n="3">A train-band captain eke was he</l>
     <l n="4">Of famous London town .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">John Gilpin 's spouse said to her dear ,</l>
     <l n="6">“ Though wedded we have been</l>
     <l n="7">These twice ten tedious years , yet we</l>
     <l n="8">No holiday have seen .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">“ To-morrow is our wedding-day ,</l>
     <l n="10">And we will then repair</l>
     <l n="11">Unto ‘ The Bell ’ at Edmonton ,</l>
     <l n="12">All in a chaise and pair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">“ My sister and my sister 's child ,</l>
     <l n="14">Myself and children three ,</l>
     <l n="15">Will fill the chaise ; so you must ride</l>
     <l n="16">On horseback after we . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">He soon replied , “ I do admire</l>
     <l n="18">Of womankind but one ,</l>
     <l n="19">And you are she , my dearest dear ,</l>
     <l n="20">Therefore it shall be done .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">“ I am a linen-draper bold ,</l>
     <l n="22">As all the world doth know ,</l>
     <l n="23">And my good friend the Calender</l>
     <l n="24">Will lend his horse to go . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">Quoth Mistress Gilpin , “ That 's well said ;</l>
     <l n="26">And , for that wine is dear ,</l>
     <l n="27">We will be furnished with our own ,</l>
     <l n="28">Which is both bright and clear . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">John Gilpin kissed his loving wife ;</l>
     <l n="30">O'erjoyed was he to find</l>
     <l n="31">That though on pleasure she was bent ,</l>
     <l n="32">She had a frugal mind .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">The morning came , the chaise was brought ,</l>
     <l n="34">But yet was not allowed</l>
     <l n="35">To drive up to the door , lest all</l>
     <l n="36">Should say that she was proud .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">So three doors off the chaise was stayed ,</l>
     <l n="38">Where they did all get in ;</l>
     <l n="39">Six precious souls , and all agog</l>
     <l n="40">To dash through thick and thin .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="41">Smack went the whip , round went the wheels ,</l>
     <l n="42">Were never folk so glad ;</l>
     <l n="43">The stones did rattle underneath</l>
     <l n="44">As if Cheapside were mad .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="45">John Gilpin at his horse 's side</l>
     <l n="46">Seized fast the flowing mane ,</l>
     <l n="47">And up he got , in haste to ride ,</l>
     <l n="48">But soon came down again ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="49">For saddle-tree scarce reached had he ,</l>
     <l n="50">His journey to begin ,</l>
     <l n="51">When , turning round his head , he saw</l>
     <l n="52">Three customers come in .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="53">So down he came ; for loss of time ,</l>
     <l n="54">Although it grieved him sore ,</l>
     <l n="55">Yet loss of pence , full well he knew ,</l>
     <l n="56">Would trouble him much more .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="57">‘ Twas long before the customers</l>
     <l n="58">Were suited to their mind .</l>
     <l n="59">When Betty , screaming , came down stairs ,</l>
     <l n="60">“ The wine is left behind ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="61">“ Good lack ! ” quoth he ; “ yet bring it me ,</l>
     <l n="62">My leathern belt likewise ,</l>
     <l n="63">In which I bear my trusty sword ,</l>
     <l n="64">When I do exercise . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="65">Now Mistress Gilpin ( careful soul ! )</l>
     <l n="66">Had two stone bottles found ,</l>
     <l n="67">To hold the liquor that she loved ,</l>
     <l n="68">And keep it safe and sound .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="69">Each bottle had a curling ear ,</l>
     <l n="70">Through which the belt he drew ,</l>
     <l n="71">And hung a bottle on each side ,</l>
     <l n="72">To make his balance true .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="73">Then over all , that he might be</l>
     <l n="74">Equipped from top to toe ,</l>
     <l n="75">His long red cloak , well brushed and neat ,</l>
     <l n="76">He manfully did throw .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="77">Now see him mounted once again</l>
     <l n="78">Upon his nimble steed ,</l>
     <l n="79">Full slowly pacing o'er the stones</l>
     <l n="80">With caution and good heed !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="81">But , finding soon a smoother road</l>
     <l n="82">Beneath his well-shod feet ,</l>
     <l n="83">The snorting beast began to trot ,</l>
     <l n="84">Which galled him in his seat .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="85">So , “ Fair and softly , ” John he cried ,</l>
     <l n="86">But John he cried in vain ;</l>
     <l n="87">That trot became a gallop soon ,</l>
     <l n="88">In spite of curb and rein .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="89">So stooping down , as needs he must</l>
     <l n="90">Who cannot sit upright ,</l>
     <l n="91">He grasped the mane with both his hands ,</l>
     <l n="92">And eke with all his might .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="93">His horse , who never in that sort</l>
     <l n="94">Had handled been before ,</l>
     <l n="95">What thing upon his back had got</l>
     <l n="96">Did wonder more and more .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="97">Away went Gilpin , neck or naught ;</l>
     <l n="98">Away went hat and wig ;</l>
     <l n="99">He little dreamt , when he set out ,</l>
     <l n="100">Of running such a rig .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="101">The wind did blow , the cloak did fly ,</l>
     <l n="102">Like streamer long and gay ,</l>
     <l n="103">Till , loop and button failing both ,</l>
     <l n="104">At last it flew away .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="105">Then might all people well discern</l>
     <l n="106">The bottles he had slung ;</l>
     <l n="107">A bottle swinging at each side ,</l>
     <l n="108">As hath been said or sung .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="109">The dogs did bark , the children screamed ,</l>
     <l n="110">Up flew the windows all ;</l>
     <l n="111">And every soul cried out , “ Well done ! ”</l>
     <l n="112">As loud as he could bawl .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="113">Away went Gilpin — who but he ?</l>
     <l n="114">His fame soon spread around —</l>
     <l n="115">He carries weight ! he rides a race !</l>
     <l n="116">‘ Tis for a thousand pound !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="30">
     <l n="117">And still , as fast as he drew near ,</l>
     <l n="118">‘ Twas wonderful to view</l>
     <l n="119">How in a trice the turnpike men</l>
     <l n="120">Their gates wide open threw .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="31">
     <l n="121">And now , as he went bowing down</l>
     <l n="122">His reeking head full low ,</l>
     <l n="123">The bottles twain behind his back</l>
     <l n="124">Were shattered at a blow .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="32">
     <l n="125">Down ran the wine into the road ,</l>
     <l n="126">Most piteous to be seen ,</l>

     <l n="153">So like an arrow swift he flew ,</l>

    <head>AN EPISTLE TO JOSEPH HILL , ESQ .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">DEAR JOSEPH ,— five and twenty years ago —</l>
     <l n="2">Alas , how time escapes !— ‘ tis even so —</l>
     <l n="3">With frequent intercourse , and always sweet</l>
     <l n="4">And always friendly , we were wont to cheat</l>
     <l n="5">A tedious hour — and now we never meet .</l>
     <l n="6">As some grave gentleman in Terence says</l>
     <l n="7">( ‘ Twas therefore much the same in ancient days ) ,</l>
     <l n="8">“ Good lack , we know not what to-morrow brings —</l>
     <l n="9">Strange fluctuation of all human things ! ”</l>
     <l n="10">True . Changes will befall , and friends may part ,</l>
     <l n="11">But distance only cannot change the heart :</l>
     <l n="12">And were I called to prove the assertion true ,</l>
     <l n="13">One proof should serve — a reference to you .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="14">Whence comes it , then , that in the wane of life ,</l>
     <l n="15">Though nothing have occurred to kindle strife ,</l>
     <l n="16">We find the friends we fancied we had won ,</l>
     <l n="17">Though numerous once , reduced to few or none ?</l>
     <l n="18">Can gold grow worthless that has stood the touch ?</l>
     <l n="19">No . Gold they seemed , but they were never such .</l>
     <l n="20">Horatio 's servant once , with bow and cringe ,</l>
     <l n="21">Swinging the parlour-door upon its hinge ,</l>
     <l n="22">Dreading a negative , and overawed</l>
     <l n="23">Lest he should trespass , begged to go abroad .</l>
     <l n="24">“ Go , fellow !— whither ? ” — turning short about —</l>
     <l n="25">“ Nay . Stay at home ; you 're always going out . ” —</l>
     <l n="26">“ ‘ Tis but a step , sir ; just at the street 's end . ”</l>
     <l n="27">“ For what ? ” — “ An please you , sir , to see a friend . ”</l>
     <l n="28">“ A friend ! ” Horatio cried , and seemed to start ;</l>
     <l n="29">“ Yea , marry shalt thou , and with all my heart —</l>
     <l n="30">And fetch my cloak , for though the night be raw</l>

     <l n="35">Else he was seldom bitter or morose .</l>
     <l n="36">Perhaps , his confidence just then betrayed ,</l>
     <l n="37">His grief might prompt him with the speech he made ;</l>
     <l n="38">Perhaps ‘ twas mere good-humour gave it birth ,</l>
     <l n="39">The harmless play of pleasantry and mirth .</l>
     <l n="40">Howe'er it was , his language in my mind</l>

     <l n="45">One story more , dear Hill , and I have done .</l>
     <l n="46">Once on a time , an emperor , a wise man .</l>
     <l n="47">No matter where , in China or Japan ,</l>
     <l n="48">Decreed that whosoever should offend</l>
     <l n="49">Against the well-known duties of a friend ,</l>
     <l n="50">Convicted once , should ever after wear</l>
     <l n="51">But half a coat , and show his bosom bare ;</l>
     <l n="52">The punishment importing this , no doubt ,</l>
     <l n="53">That all was naught within and all found out .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="54">Oh happy Britain ! we have not to fear</l>
     <l n="55">Such hard and arbitrary measure here ;</l>
     <l n="56">Else could a law , like that which I relate ,</l>
     <l n="57">Once have the sanction of our triple state ,</l>
     <l n="58">Some few that I have known in days of old</l>
     <l n="59">Would run most dreadful risk of catching cold .</l>
     <l n="60">While you , my friend , whatever wind should blow ,</l>
     <l n="61">Might traverse England safely to and fro ,</l>
     <l n="62">An honest man , close buttoned to the chin ,</l>
