    <head>GEORGE THE THIRD 'S SOLILOQUY<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></head>
     <l n="1">What mean these dreams , and hideous forms that rise</l>
     <l n="2">Night after night , tormenting to my eyes —</l>
     <l n="3">No real foes these horrid shapes can be ,</l>
     <l n="4">But thrice as much they vex and torture me .</l>
     <l n="5">How cursed is he — how doubly cursed am I — 5</l>
     <l n="6">Who lives in pain , and yet who dares not die ;</l>
     <l n="7">To him no joy this world of Nature brings ,</l>
     <l n="8">In vain the wild rose blooms , the daisy springs .</l>
     <l n="9">Is this a prelude to some new disgrace ,</l>
     <l n="10">Some baleful omen to my name and race !— 10</l>
     <l n="11">It may be so — ere mighty Caesar died</l>
     <l n="12">Presaging Nature felt his doom , and sighed ;</l>
     <l n="13">A bellowing voice through midnight groves was heard ,</l>
     <l n="14">And threatening ghosts at dusk of eve appeared —</l>
     <l n="15">Ere Brutus fell , to adverse fates a prey , 15</l>
     <l n="16">His evil genius met him on the way ,</l>
     <l n="17">And so may mine !— but who would yield so soon</l>
     <l n="18">A prize , some luckier hour may make my own ?</l>
     <l n="19">Shame seize my crown ere such a deed be mine —</l>
     <l n="20">No — to the last my squadrons shall combine , 20</l>
     <l n="21">And slay my foes , while foes remain to slay ,</l>
     <l n="22">Or heaven shall grant me one successful day .</l>
     <l n="23">Is there a robber close in Newgate hemmed ,</l>
     <l n="24">Is there a cut-throat , fettered and condemned ?</l>
     <l n="25">Haste , loyal slaves , to George 's standard come , 25</l>
     <l n="26">Attend his lectures when you hear the drum ;</l>
     <l n="27">Your chains I break — for better days prepare ,</l>
     <l n="28">Come out , my friends , from prison and from care ,</l>
     <l n="29">Far to the west I plan your desperate sway ,</l>
     <l n="30">There ‘ tis no sin to ravage , burn , and slay , 30</l>
     <l n="31">There , without fear , your bloody aims pursue ,</l>
     <l n="32">And shew mankind what English thieves can do .</l>
     <l n="33">That day , when first I mounted to the throne ,</l>
     <l n="34">I swore to let all foreign foes alone .</l>
     <l n="35">Through love of peace to terms did I advance , 35</l>
     <l n="36">And made , they say , a shameful league with France .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span></l>
     <l n="37">But different scenes rise horrid to my view ,</l>
     <l n="38">I charged my hosts to plunder and subdue —</l>
     <l n="39">At first , indeed , I thought short wars to wage</l>
     <l n="40">And sent some jail-birds to be led by Gage ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>40</l>
     <l n="41">For ‘ twas but right , that those we marked for slaves</l>
     <l n="42">Should be reduced by cowards , fools , and knaves ;</l>
     <l n="43">Awhile directed by his feeble hand ,</l>
     <l n="44">Whose troops were kicked and pelted through the land ,</l>
     <l n="45">Or starved in Boston , cursed the unlucky hour 45</l>
     <l n="46">They left their dungeons for that fatal shore .</l>
     <l n="47">France aids them now , a desperate game I play ,</l>
     <l n="48">And hostile Spain will do the same , they say ;</l>
     <l n="49">My armies vanquished , and my heroes fled ,</l>
     <l n="50">My people murmuring , and my commerce dead , 50</l>
     <l n="51">My shattered navy pelted , bruised , and clubbed ,</l>
     <l n="52">By Dutchmen bullied , and by Frenchmen drubbed ,</l>
     <l n="53">My name abhorred , my nation in disgrace ,</l>
     <l n="54">How should I act in such a mournful case !</l>
     <l n="55">My hopes and joys are vanished with my coin , 55</l>
     <l n="56">My ruined army , and my lost Burgoyne !</l>
     <l n="57">What shall I do — confess my labours vain ,</l>
     <l n="58">Or whet my tusks , and to the charge again !</l>
     <l n="59">But where 's my force — my choicest troops are fled ,</l>
     <l n="60">Some thousands crippled , and a myriad dead — 60</l>
     <l n="61">If I were owned the boldest of mankind ,</l>
     <l n="62">And hell with all her flames inspired my mind ,</l>
     <l n="63">Could I at once with Spain and France contend ,</l>
     <l n="64">And fight the rebels on the world 's green end ?—</l>
     <l n="65">The pangs of parting I can ne'er endure , 65</l>
     <l n="66">Yet part we must , and part to meet no more !</l>
     <l n="67">Oh , blast this Congress , blast each upstart State ,</l>
     <l n="68">On whose commands ten thousand captains wait ;</l>
     <l n="69">From various climes that dire Assembly came ,</l>
     <l n="70">True to their trust , as hostile to my fame , 70</l>
     <l n="71">‘ Tis these , ah these , have ruined half my sway ,</l>
     <l n="72">Disgraced my arms , and led my slaves astray —</l>
     <l n="73">Cursed be the day when first I saw the sun ,</l>
     <l n="74">Cursed be the hour when I these wars begun :</l>
     <l n="75">The fiends of darkness then possessed my mind , 75</l>
     <l n="76">And powers unfriendly to the human kind .</l>
     <l n="77">To wasting grief , and sullen rage a prey ,</l>
     <l n="78">To Scotland 's utmost verge I 'll take my way ,</l>
     <l n="79">There with eternal storms due concert keep</l>
     <l n="80">And while the billows rage , as fiercely weep — 80</l>
     <l n="81">Ye highland lads , my rugged fate bemoan ,</l>
     <l n="82">Assist me with one sympathizing groan ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span></l>
     <l n="83">For late I find the nations are my foes ,</l>
     <l n="84">I must submit , and that with bloody nose ,</l>
     <l n="85">Or , like our James , fly basely from the state , 85</l>
     <l n="86">Or share , what still is worse — old Charles 's fate .</l>

   <p>“ Early in June , the French fleet of thirty-one ships of the line , yielding to Spanish importunities , put to sea from Brest ; and yet they were obliged to wait off the coast of Spain for the Spaniards . After a loss of two months in the best season of the year , a junction was effected with more than twenty ships of war under the command of ... Count Gaston ; and the combined fleet , the largest force that had ever been afloat , sailed for the British Channel .... The united fleet rode unmolested by the British .... On the 16th of August they appeared off Plymouth , but did not attack the town . After two idle days a strong wind drove them to the west ; when the gale had abated , the allies rallied , returned up the channel , and the British retreated before them . No harmony existed between the French and Spanish officers . A deadly malady ravaged the French ships and infected the Spanish . The combined fleet never had one chief . The French returned to port and remained there ; the Spaniards sailed for Cadiz , execrating their allies . ” — Bancroft .</p>

     <lg type="stanza" n="2">
      <l n="2">Amid these ills no tyrant dared refuse</l>
      <l n="3">My right to pen the dictates of the muse ,</l>
      <l n="4">To paint the terrors of the infernal place ,</l>
      <l n="5">And fiends from Europe , insolent as base .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="3">
      <l n="6">Assist me , Clio ! while in verse I tell</l>
      <l n="7">The dire misfortunes that a ship befell ,</l>
      <l n="8">Which outward bound , to St. Eustatia 's shore ,</l>
      <l n="9">Death and disaster through the billows bore .</l>
      <l n="10">From Philadelphia 's crowded port she came ;</l>
      <l n="11">For there the builder plann 'd her lofty frame ,</l>
      <l n="12">With wond'rous skill , and excellence of art</l>
      <l n="13">He form 'd , dispos 'd , and order 'd every part ,</l>
      <l n="14">With joy beheld the stately fabric rise</l>
      <l n="15">To a stout bulwark of stupendous size ,</l>
      <l n="16">‘ Till launch 'd at last , capacious of the freight ,</l>
      <l n="17">He left her to the Pilots , and her fate .</l>
      <l n="18">First from her depths the tapering masts ascend ,</l>
      <l n="19">On whose firm bulk the transverse yards depend ,</l>
      <l n="20">By shrouds and stays secur 'd from side to side</l>
      <l n="21">Trees grew on trees , suspended o'er the tide ,</l>
      <l n="22">Firm to the yards extended , broad and vast</l>
      <l n="23">They hung the sails susceptive of the blast ,</l>
      <l n="24">Far o'er the prow the lengthy bowsprit lay ,</l>
      <l n="25">Supporting on the extreme the taught Gib-stay ,</l>
      <l n="26">Twice ten six pounders at their port holes plac 'd</l>
      <l n="27">And rang 'd in rows , stood hostile in the waist :</l>
      <l n="28">Thus all prepar 'd , impatient for the seas ,</l>
      <l n="29">She left her station with an adverse breeze ,</l>
      <l n="30">This her first outset from her native shore ,</l>
      <l n="31">To seas a stranger , and untry 'd before .</l>
      <l n="32">From the bright radiance that his glories spread</l>
      <l n="33">Ere from the east gay Phoebus lifts his head ,</l>
      <l n="34">From the sweet morn , a kindred name she won ,</l>
      <l n="35">Aurora call 'd , the offspring of the sun ,</l>
      <l n="36">Whose form projecting , the broad prow displays ,</l>
      <l n="37">Far glittering o'er the wave , a mimic blaze .</l>
      <l n="38">The gay ship now , in all her pomp and pride ,</l>
      <l n="39">With sails expanded , flew along the tide ;</l>
      <l n="40">‘ Twas thy deep stream , O Delaware , that bore</l>
      <l n="41">This pile intended for a southern shore ,</l>
      <l n="42">Bound to those isles where endless summer reigns ,</l>
      <l n="43">Fair fruits , gay blossoms , and enamell 'd plains ;</l>
      <l n="44">Where sloping lawns the roving swain invite ,</l>
      <l n="45">And the cool morn succeeds the breezy night ,</l>
      <l n="46">Where each glad day a heaven unclouded brings</l>
      <l n="47">And sky-topt mountains teem with golden springs .</l>
      <l n="48">From Cape Henlopen , urg 'd by favouring gales ,</l>
      <l n="49">When morn emerg 'd , we sea-ward spread our sails ,</l>
      <l n="50">Then east-south-east explor 'd the briny way ,</l>
      <l n="51">Close to the wind , departing from the bay ;</l>
      <l n="52">No longer seen the hoarse resounding strand ,</l>
      <l n="53">With hearts elate we hurried from the land ,</l>
      <l n="54">Escap 'd the dangers of that shelvy ground ,</l>
      <l n="55">To sailors fatal , and for wrecks renown 'd .—</l>
      <l n="56">The gale increases as we stem the main ,</l>
      <l n="57">Now scarce the hills their sky-blue mist retain ,</l>
      <l n="58">At last they sink beneath the rolling wave</l>
      <l n="59">That seems their summits , as they sink , to lave ;</l>
      <l n="60">Abaft the beam the freshening breezes play ,</l>
      <l n="61">No mists advancing to deform the day ,</l>
      <l n="62">No tempests rising o'er the splendid scene ,</l>
      <l n="63">A sea unruffled , and a heaven serene .</l>
      <l n="64">Now Sol 's bright lamp , the heav'n born source of light ,</l>
      <l n="65">Had pass 'd the line of his meridian height ,</l>
      <l n="66">And westward hung — retreating from the view</l>
      <l n="67">Shores disappear 'd , and every hill withdrew ,</l>
      <l n="68">When , still suspicious of some neighbouring foe ,</l>
      <l n="69">Aloft the Master bade a Seaman go ,</l>
      <l n="70">To mark if , from the mast 's aspiring height</l>
      <l n="71">Through all the round a vessel came in sight .</l>
      <l n="72">Too soon the Seaman 's glance , extending wide ,</l>
      <l n="73">Far distant in the east a ship espy 'd ,</l>
      <l n="74">Her lofty masts stood bending to the gale ,</l>
      <l n="75">Close to the wind was brac 'd each shivering sail ;</l>
      <l n="76">Next from the deck we saw the approaching foe ,</l>
      <l n="77">Her spangled bottom seem 'd in flames to glow</l>
      <l n="78">When to the winds she bow 'd in dreadful haste</l>
      <l n="79">And her lee-guns lay delug 'd in the waste :</l>
      <l n="80">From her top-gallant flow 'd an English Jack ;</l>
      <l n="81">With all her might she strove to gain our track ,</l>
      <l n="82">Nor strove in vain — with pride and power elate ,</l>
      <l n="83">Wing 'd on by hell , she drove us to our fate ;</l>
      <l n="84">No stop no stay her bloody crew intends ,</l>
      <l n="85">( So flies a comet with its host of fiends )</l>
      <l n="86">Nor oaths , nor prayers arrest her swift career ,</l>
      <l n="87">Death in her front , and ruin in her rear .</l>
      <l n="88">Struck at the sight , the Master gave command</l>
      <l n="89">To change our course , and steer toward the land —</l>
      <l n="90">Swift to the task the ready sailors run ,</l>
      <l n="91">And while the word was utter 'd , half was done :</l>
      <l n="92">As from the south the fiercer breezes rise</l>
      <l n="93">Swift from her foe alarm 'd Aurora flies ,</l>
      <l n="94">With every sail extended to the wind</l>
      <l n="95">She fled the unequal foe that chac 'd behind ;</l>
      <l n="96">Along her decks dispos 'd in close array</l>
      <l n="97">Each at its port , the grim artillery lay ,</l>
      <l n="98">Soon on the foe with brazen throat to roar ;</l>
      <l n="99">But , small their size , and narrow was their bore ;</l>
      <l n="100">Yet faithful they their destin 'd station keep</l>
      <l n="101">To guard the barque that wafts them o'er the deep ,</l>
      <l n="102">Who now must bend to steer a homeward course</l>
      <l n="103">And trust her swiftness rather than her force ,</l>
      <l n="104">Unfit to combat with a powerful foe ;</l>
      <l n="105">Her decks too open , and her waist too low .</l>
      <l n="106">While o'er the wave with foaming prow she flies ,</l>
      <l n="107">Once more emerging , distant landscapes rise ;</l>
      <l n="108">High in the air the starry streamer plays ,</l>
      <l n="109">And every sail its various tribute pays :</l>
      <l n="110">To gain the land we bore the weighty blast ;</l>
      <l n="111">And now the wish 'd for cape appear 'd at last ;</l>
      <l n="112">But the vext foe , impatient of delay ,</l>
      <l n="113">Prepar 'd for ruin , press 'd upon her prey ;</l>
      <l n="114">Near , and more near , in aweful grandeur came</l>
      <l n="115">The frigate Iris , not unknown to fame ;</l>
      <l n="116">Iris her name , but Hancock once she bore ,</l>
      <l n="117">Fram 'd and completed on New Albion 's shore ,</l>
      <l n="118">By Manly lost , the swiftest of the train</l>
      <l n="119">That fly with wings of canvas o'er the main .</l>
      <l n="120">Now , while for combat some with zeal prepare ,</l>
      <l n="121">Thus to the heavens the Boatswain sent his prayer :</l>
      <l n="122">“ List , all ye powers that rule the skies and seas !</l>
      <l n="123">“ Shower down perdition on such thieves as these ,</l>
      <l n="124">“ Fate , strike their hearts with terror and dismay ,</l>
      <l n="125">“ And sprinkle on their powder salt-sea spray !</l>
      <l n="126">“ May bursting cannon , while his aim he tries ,</l>
      <l n="127">“ Destroy the Gunner , and be-damn his eyes —</l>
      <l n="128">“ The chief who awes the quarter-deck , may he ,</l>
      <l n="129">“ Tripp 'd from his stand , be tumbled in the sea .</l>
      <l n="130">“ May they who rule the round-top 's giddy height</l>
      <l n="131">“ Be canted headlong to perpetual night ;</l>
      <l n="132">“ May fiends torment them on a leeward coast ,</l>
      <l n="133">“ And help forsake them when they want it most —</l>
      <l n="134">“ From their wheel 'd engines torn be every gun —</l>
      <l n="135">“ And now , to sum up every curse in one ,</l>
      <l n="136">“ May latent flames , to save us , intervene ,</l>
      <l n="137">“ And hell-ward drive them from their magazine ! ” —</l>
      <l n="138">The Frigate now had every sail unfurl 'd ,</l>
      <l n="139">And rush 'd tremendous o'er the wat'ry world ;</l>
      <l n="140">Thus fierce Pelides , eager to destroy ,</l>
      <l n="141">Chac 'd the proud Trojan to the gates of Troy —</l>
      <l n="142">Swift o'er the waves while hostile they pursue</l>
      <l n="143">As swiftly from their fangs Aurora flew ,</l>
      <l n="144">At length Henlopen 's cape we gain 'd once more ,</l>
      <l n="145">And vainly strove to force the ship ashore ;</l>
      <l n="146">Stern fate forbade the barren shore to gain ,</l>
      <l n="147">Denial sad , and source of future pain !</l>
      <l n="148">For then the inspiring breezes ceas 'd to blow ,</l>
      <l n="149">Lost were they all , and smooth the seas below ;</l>
      <l n="150">By the broad cape becalm 'd , our lifeless sails</l>
      <l n="151">No longer swell 'd their bosoms to the gales ;</l>
      <l n="152">The ship , unable to pursue her way ,</l>
      <l n="153">Tumbling about , at her own guidance lay ,</l>
      <l n="154">No more the helm its wonted influence lends ,</l>
      <l n="155">No oars assist us , and no breeze befriends ;</l>
      <l n="156">Meantime the foe , advancing from the sea ,</l>
      <l n="157">Rang 'd her black cannon , pointed on our lee ,</l>
      <l n="158">Then up she luff 'd , and blaz 'd her entrails dire ,</l>
      <l n="159">Bearing destruction , terror , death and fire .</l>
      <l n="160">Vext at our fate , we prim 'd a piece , and then</l>
      <l n="161">Return 'd the shot , to shew them we were men .</l>
      <l n="162">Dull night at length her dusky pinions spread ,</l>
      <l n="163">And every hope to ‘ scape the foe was fled ;</l>
      <l n="164">Close to thy cape , Henlopen , though we press 'd ,</l>
      <l n="165">We could not gain thy desert , dreary breast ;</l>
      <l n="166">Though ruin 'd trees beshroud thy barren shore</l>
      <l n="167">With mounds of sand half hid , or cover 'd o'er ,</l>
      <l n="168">Though ruffian winds disturb thy summit bare ,</l>
      <l n="169">Yet every hope and every wish was there ;</l>
      <l n="170">In vain we sought to reach the joyless strand ,</l>
      <l n="171">Fate stood between , and barr 'd us from the land .</l>
      <l n="172">All dead becalm 'd , and helpless as we lay ,</l>
      <l n="173">The ebbing current forc 'd us back to sea ,</l>
      <l n="174">While vengeful Iris , thirsting for our blood ,</l>
      <l n="175">Flash 'd her red lightnings o'er the trembling flood ,</l>
      <l n="176">At every flash a storm of ruin came</l>
      <l n="177">‘ Till our shock 'd vessel shook through all her frame —</l>
      <l n="178">Mad for revenge , our breasts with fury glow</l>
      <l n="179">To wreak returns of vengeance on the foe ;</l>
      <l n="180">Full at his hull our pointed guns we rais 'd ,</l>
      <l n="181">His hull resounded as the cannon blaz 'd ;</l>
      <l n="182">Through his main top-sail one a passage tore ,</l>
      <l n="183">His sides re-echo 'd to the dreadful roar ,</l>
      <l n="184">Alternate fires dispell 'd the shades of night —</l>
      <l n="185">But how unequal was this daring fight !</l>
      <l n="186">Our stoutest guns threw but a six-pound ball ,</l>
      <l n="187">Twelve pounders from the foe our sides did maul ,</l>
      <l n="188">And , while no power to save him intervenes ,</l>
      <l n="189">A bullet struck our captain of Marines ;</l>
      <l n="190">Fierce , though he bid defiance to the foe</l>
      <l n="191">He felt his death and ruin in the blow ,</l>
      <l n="192">Headlong he fell , distracted with the wound ,</l>
      <l n="193">The deck distain 'd , and heart blood streaming round .</l>
      <l n="194">Another blast , as fatal in its aim ,</l>
      <l n="195">Wing 'd by destruction , through our rigging came ,</l>
      <l n="196">And , whistling tunes from hell upon its way ,</l>
      <l n="197">Shrouds , stays , and braces tore at once away ,</l>
      <l n="198">Sails , blocks , and oars in scatter 'd fragments fly —</l>
      <l n="199">Their softest language was — submit , or die !</l>
      <l n="200">Repeated cries throughout the ship resound ;</l>
      <l n="201">Now every bullet brought a different wound ;</l>
      <l n="202">‘ Twixt wind and water , one assail 'd the side ,</l>
      <l n="203">Through this aperture rush 'd the briny tide —</l>
      <l n="204">‘ Twas then the Master trembled for his crew ,</l>
      <l n="205">And bade thy shores , O Delaware , adieu !—</l>
      <l n="206">And must we yield to yon ’ destructive ball ,</l>
      <l n="207">And must our colours to these ruffians fall !—</l>
      <l n="208">They fall !— his thunders forc 'd our pride to bend ,</l>
      <l n="209">The lofty topsails with their yards descend ,</l>
      <l n="210">And the proud foe , such leagues of ocean pass 'd ,</l>
      <l n="211">His wish completed in our woe at last .</l>
      <l n="212">Convey 'd to York , we found , at length , too late ,</l>
      <l n="213">That Death was better than the prisoner 's fate ;</l>
      <l n="214">There doom 'd to famine , shackles and despair ,</l>
      <l n="215">Condemn 'd to breathe a foul , infected air</l>
      <l n="216">In sickly hulks , devoted while we lay ,</l>
      <l n="217">Successive funerals gloom 'd each dismal day —</l>

     <l n="1">On May 25 , 1780 , Freneau , in the ship Aurora , started from</l>
     <l n="2">Philadelphia as a passenger for Santa Cruz . The next day , while off Cape</l>
     <l n="3">Henlopen , the ship was captured by the British frigate Iris , Capt .</l>

   </lg>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 28 ]</span>“ The weather was very stormy and the river uncommonly rough . The ship rolled considerably , and the water gushed into some of the lower ports , which made some of the landsmen who slept in the cable tier imagine she was sinking . In a moment the alarm became general . ‘ The ship is sinking ! the ship is sinking ! ’ was echoed fore and aft . I expected every moment to feel myself afloat in the berth where I lay ; but at the same time considering it would be a folly to drown between decks when I perhaps might get on shore somehow , I jumped up and hurried toward the main hatchway , where a multitude was endeavouring to get out ; the sentries at the same time beating on their heads with their drawn swords and marquets without mercy .... Some lamented that they should never see their wives and children again ; others begged by the love of God to be let upon deck and they would bind themselves slaves forever on board a man-of-war , or any other service .... After some trouble we got a light , and examining the pump-well , found the ship dry and tight . ” — Freneau 's Journal .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 29 ]</span>“ One , Gauzoo , was steward of the ship — one of the most brutal of mankind , who abused us continually . It is impossible for words to give his character ; it seemed as though he could not give any of us a civil word upon the most indifferent occasion . When he was not cursing us , he kept in his cabin in gloomy reserve , the most vile and detestable of mortals . ” — Freneau 's Journal .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 30 ]</span>“ At sundown we were ordered down between the decks , to the number of nearly three hundred of us . The best lodgings I could procure this night was on a chest , almost suffocated with the heat and stench . I expected to die before morning , but human nature can bear more than one would at first suppose . ” — Freneau 's Journal .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 31 ]</span>“ The Hunter had been very newly put to the use of a hospital-ship . She was miserably dirty and cluttered . Her decks leaked to such a degree that the sick were deluged with every shower of rain . Between decks they lay along struggling in the agonies of death ; dying with putrid and bilious fevers ; lamenting their hard fate to die at such a fatal distance from their friends ; others totally insensible , and yielding their last breath in all the horrors of light-headed frenzy .... Our allowance in the Hunter , to those upon full diet , was one pound of bread and one pound of fresh beef per diem ; to those upon half diet , one pound of bread and one-half pound of beef or mutton per diem . Every other day we had a cask of spruce beer sent on board . Our fresh meat was generally heads or shanks , and would just answer to make soup . ” — Freneau 's Journal .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 32 ]</span>“ A German doctor attended every morning at eight o'clock and administered such remedies as were thought proper . Thus things went on , two or three dying every day , who were carried on shore and buried in the bank , till three of our crew , who had got pretty hearty , stole the boat one night and made their escape . This occasioned new trouble . The doctor refused to come on board , and as he rowed past us next morning to see somebody in the Jersey , which lay near us , some of the sick calling to him for blisters , he told them to put tar on their backs , which would serve as well as anything , and so rowed away . However , after two or three days his wrath was appeased , and he deigned to come on board again . ” — Freneau 's Journal .</p>

     <l n="4">ARNOLD , working in a garden .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Pasq . ( Throwing down his spade ) Faith , Jeffery , I am weary of toiling among these rocks and precipices . I must e'en give o'er . Our master should have fetched his soil along with him to these savage retreats . We may work till we are gray-headed ere we can produce a turnip or a cabbage for him on these barren , unthrifty rocks .</p>
   <p>Jeff . Be not discouraged , Pasquin , we shall have better soil to work in ere long .</p>
   <p>Pasq . How know you that ?</p>
   <p>Jeff . I overheard my master t'other day telling a friend of his , whom , by the by , the people of this country call a Tory , that he had planned matters so that in a little time the war would be over , and then he would purchase one of the most fertile tracts of land in America and entitle it a Manor ; that he would settle the same goodly possession with tenants and vassals , and so being master among them , spend the remainder of his days in quiet .</p>
   <p>Pasq . I pray for the speedy fulfilling of this design . Our master , I know , is an able general . Why , I suppose he intends to rout the enemy out of New York , retake Charleston , conquer the warships of Britain , kill the king , and so force the English nation to make peace with the Americans .</p>
   <p>Jeff . Heaven only knows in what manner he intends to act or what his plan may be , but this I am sure of , he keeps it very secret , and I believe there are not above one or two of his friends that know anything of it .</p>
   <p>Pasq . Well , the sooner he gets a new garden for us the better . I have worn out a dozen mattocks and as many spades on these cursed craggy rocks . One 's tools to work here should be made of adamant . But , Jeffery , do you not observe how gracious and intimate our master has been for these several months past with some who are called disaffected ?</p>
   <p>Jeff . I have had it in my mind to make the same observation to you , and do you not perceive that their intimacy daily increases ?</p>
   <p>Pasq . And then , when our master is at table with some of these chosen favorites , how he sneers and hints ludicrous things against the American officers and army . One would think he heartily despised them , by his behaviour .</p>
   <p>Jeff . And what was it he said of the French the other day ? Did he not say they were a perfidious nation of knaves , a herd of needy scoundrels who were endeavoring to conquer this country from the king of Britain , that they might add it to their own dominions and make the people here slaves ?</p>
   <p>Pasq . And when the general gives a dance or an entertainment or a ball , we see none of the true-heart Americans invited . His guests are a lukewarm , half-disaffected sort of people , who say more than for their own sakes I would choose to mention to everybody .</p>
   <p>Jeff . Well , this may all be true , and yet I cannot help thinking our master is a hearty friend to his country . He does these things for a feint , under a mask , as it were , to find out secrets from the enemy . In good faith , I am of opinion he will shortly drive every British soldier off the continent and then become possessed of his Lordship or Manor , or what-so you call it .</p>
   <p>Pasq . Amen , I say , and so let us work on in hopes of better times .</p>

     <l n="160">In tedious route through hyperborean wilds ,</l>

     <l n="181">Confer with me upon the fittest means</l>

     <l n="81">SCENE II .— MAJOR ANDRE , LUCINDA . Parlor .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Maj. Andre . I cannot leave this city , sweet Lucinda , without imparting to you that I am going a little way toward the American lines , at the request of his Excellency , upon some business of importance . I am come to chat a little with you ere I go . It may be some days before you see me again .</p>
   <p>Lucinda . If it be not too great a presumption in me , my dear Major , I would beg to know whether you depart on a peaceable or hostile errand . You must pardon a woman 's curiosity . I had a frightful dream about you a few nights ago , which I cannot banish from my mind ever since .</p>
   <p>Maj. Andre . I am happy , madam , in being the subject of your dreams . But dreams are delusions of the mind , mere vagaries and whimsies not to be attended to . You may remember that , prior to our Charlestown expedition , you discouraged me a good deal with a vision you had of a vessel shipwrecked , and myself with the other passengers drowned , and yet little or nothing was intimated thereby . We made our passage safe , conquered the place , and returned with victory and honor .</p>
   <p>Lucinda . True . But your fleet endured a terrible hurricane , in which many perished .</p>
   <p>Maj. Andre . O Lucinda , thou art a dreamer of dreams , thou thinkest , love .</p>
   <p>Lucinda . This last was represented to my mind in quite a different manner , in such lively colours that I cannot help thinking some evil is foreboded to you .</p>
   <p>Maj. Andre . Poh ! Let 's hear the extraordinary dream , then , that we may laugh a little at it .</p>
   <p>Lucinda . I imagined myself in a country where the skies were forever cloudy and gloomy , with frequent bursts of thunder and flashes of lightning . Among many other objects , all of which seemed disconsolate and melancholy , I saw you endeavouring to reach the summit of a sharp , craggy precipice . You leaped with surprising agility over dark gulfs and apertures therein , which no other man would have thought of passing . The spectators admired your activity and daring spirit . The continual obstacles in your way seemed nothing to you , and at length you bid fair to gain the summit , when , catching hold of a shrub , which was but slightly rooted in one of the crevices of the rock , it instantly gave way , and you tumbled to the bottom , dashed to pieces on the pointed crags and torn in a shocking manner . I shrieked out and waked .</p>
   <p>Maj. Andre . Your dream was frightful indeed ; but still it was nothing but a dream . Why , I have imagined before now in my sleep that I have tumbled down ten thousand fathoms in a perpendicular line ; but all this was owing to mere mechanical causes , the motion of the animal spirits or the veins being rather too replete with blood .</p>
   <p>Lucinda . Well , be it so . I hope my dream may be the forerunner of no mischief . But are you going out on a fighting expedition , sir , if I may be so bold to ask the question ?</p>
   <p>Maj. Andre . My dearest love , I will conceal nothing from you . I know you are the girl of a thousand for keeping a secret . It must not take air . I have corrupted General Arnold . He is to sell West Point fort to me , and this evening I am to set out and consult with him upon the fittest means to blind the eyes of the Samson and deliver up the place to Sir Henry without danger of failure .</p>
   <p>Lucinda . But could not some person be deputized for this purpose whose life is not of such value to Britain as yours ? You are a proud soul to Sir Henry Clinton . He enterprises nothing without first having your advice and direction . If you should be intercepted in your way by the Americans , would it not endanger your life , my dear Andre , to be found without some mission or any plausible excuse for being within an enemy 's lines ?</p>
   <p>Maj. Andre . You are too timorous , Lucinda . I shall go and come by water in an armed ship . I may perhaps just venture on shore in a ——<span type="note_anchor">[ 34 ]</span>of time , but shall take care not to expose myself to any danger . I well know how far to venture , but if the worst come to the worst , I can tell them I have deserted from the British . Then I shall be caressed among them till such times as I can find an opportunity to escape and join my countrymen .</p>
   <p>Lucinda . You venture all this , you say , at the request of Sir Henry ?</p>
   <p>Maj. Andre . Yes ; but chiefly to serve my country . Had I a thousand lives , I would lay them all down for Britain and my king . But I must go . You deject my spirits , my girl . A woman is destructive to the spirit of enterprise in a man . Poh ! I am growing melancholy too . You must cheer my drooping soul , Lucinda . I heard you humming a little song the other day . Do let 's have it . I think it begins thus : “ My native shades delight no more . ”</p>
   <p>Lucinda . Although I am in no humour for music , you shall hear it , my love . I suppose it was made by some British officer on his setting out for America , who was as great an idolater to his king and country as most English gentlemen .</p>

   <p>Maj. Andre . You sing charmingly , Lucinda . The poor fellow 's resolution pleases me . He engages to give his life , if necessary , for his king and country , and yet perhaps he feels the ingratitude of both every hour in the day . It must , however , be so . Nature has formed us with a principle of love to our native land . What say you , Lucinda ?</p>
   <p>Lucinda . It may be so , sir ; and yet that love need not carry us to such an idolatrous extravagance as is manifested in the little stanzas I had the pleasure of singing to you .</p>
   <p>Maj. Andre . Indeed you are in the right , but we are slaves to custom .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Pasquin . Sir , there is a traveller just alighted at Sergeant Jones 's quarters , who desires to know whether he can have a little private conference with you , and asked me whether you were alone or no .</p>
   <p>Arnold . A traveller ? How is he dressed ?</p>
   <p>Pasquin . He has on a plain suit of blue clothes , a cocked beaver hat and draw boots . He rides a common bay horse , and by his general appearance one would suppose him to be a commissary , or perhaps a quarter-master .</p>
   <p>Arnold . How came you to know all these particulars ; the night being so dark and stormy ?</p>
   <p>Pasquin . I had a glimpse of him by means of a lanthorn we carried out when he got off his horse . Over all , I forgot to mention , he had a fear-naught riding coat .</p>
   <p>Arnold . A plain blue suit , you say ?</p>
   <p>Pasquin . Yes .</p>
   <p>Arnold . And draw boots ?</p>
   <p>Pasquin . Yes .</p>
   <p>Arnold . And wore he sword ?</p>
   <p>Pasquin . No ; he had no sword , that I saw .</p>
   <p>Arnold . And what aspect is he ? Is he a well-looking man ?</p>
   <p>Pasquin . As handsome a man , please your honour , as ever the sun shone upon . It did me good to look upon him .</p>
   <p>Arnold ( aside ) . This must be him .</p>
   <p>[ To Pasquin ] Bid the sergeant show him the way to me immediately , and put up his horse in my own stable . He is from Philadelphia , a friend and relative of mine .</p>
   <p>[ Exit Pasquin</p>
   <p>Arnold ( solus ) . This is Major Andre , indeed . We have agreed in our correspondence that he shall pass here under the name of Captain Ashton , to prevent suspicion .</p>
   <p>[ Sergeant introduces Major Andre</p>
   <p>Arnold . Captain Ashton , my friend , how are you ? Please to draw near the fire and sit . How do our friends at Philadelphia ? [ Exit sergeant ] The booby is now gone , and we may talk freely without suspicion .</p>
   <p>Maj. Andre . I am happy at length to see General Arnold , with whom I have corresponded so long at a distance . I hope , my dear general , you are ready to perform your promise .</p>
   <p>Arnold . Undoubtedly the fort shall be yours within three days , upon the conditions I mentioned to you in my last letter . I hope you have apprised Sir Henry of them .</p>
   <p>Maj. Andre . Yes , sir . He is satisfied , and thinks your demand really moderate ; but now let us to the point . We must fall upon some plan by which we must act without much danger of miscarriage . Would it not be best that our troops should seem to take the fort by surprise , and thus prevent the world from having any suspicion of treachery in the case ?</p>
   <p>Arnold . I have had the same thought , my dear sir . Besides , if we can make this pass , I shall become a prisoner of war to you in appearance , be exchanged after a little time , and so be in a capacity to serve you again ; or , pretending the fort not tenable , I may make my escape during your attack , and all this without any suspicion on the part of the Americans .</p>
   <p>Maj. Andre . God grant your scheme may be successful .</p>
   <p>Arnold . Now hear what I have to propose further . When you are embarked with your army , suppose one or two thousand men or more sail up the river as far as you safely can , short of the fort , and endeavour to make the country believe you are on a plundering expedition . I shall have companies out who will give me notice of all your movements . Then land your men , march up to the fort , demand a surrender , which I will absolutely refuse . Upon which hang out your bloody flag and fire against the walls point blank , without mercy . In that part of the fortress where I shall be , you will see a small white flag flying . Do not fire to that quarter . The garrison shall discharge the artillery three times over your heads , after which I will surrender and open the gates to you . Then , by not putting one of the garrison to death , which would be your right , you having stormed it , you will have an excellent opportunity of giving the world a new instance of British humanity . Then you may pour your troops into the fort , take possession of it , and hoist the British flag . The prisoners may immediately be sent to the shipping and ordered to New York before the Continental forces will have a chance of hindering the embarkation . What say you ?</p>
   <p>Maj. Andre . Excellently well imagined . I hope it may succeed . The money shall be paid you on your arrival at York ; but there is another service Sir Henry would fain hope you could indulge him in , and your reward shall be double .</p>
   <p>Arnold . What may it be ?</p>
   <p>Maj. Andre . He is eager to be possessed of your Commander-in-Chief . Could you contrive no way to get him into our hands ? He is the soul of this obstinate rebellion . Were he a prisoner to us , America would soon be ours again .</p>
   <p>Arnold ( pausing ) . Why , true , it would greatly facilitate the recovery of the colonies . Let me see . I will endeavour to prevail upon him to spend a day or two at Robinson 's home . Nay , I am sure he will be here next Monday , and the garrison . There are a number of disaffected people not far from hence , whom I can engage to secure his person and convey him on board the Vulture ship of war .</p>
   <p>Maj. Andre . If we become by your means possessed of these two jewels , General Washington and this important fort , we shall never think the obligation sufficiently acknowledged . You will become the greatest man in the world . Britain will adore you . She will kiss the very ground you tread upon , besides lavishing wealth upon you by millions .</p>
   <p>Arnold . She is heartily welcome to such poor services as I can render her . What I do is from principle , from the consciousness of a rectitude of heart and love to my country .</p>
   <p>Maj. Andre . Sir , you were born to be a great man . Now , if you will be pleased to deliver me the plan of the fort , signals of recognizance and other papers of consequence in this affair , I will be going . I do not think myself safe till such times as I get within the British lines again .</p>
   <p>Arnold . The danger is trifling . With a passport from me , you may go anywhere in these colonies .</p>
   <p>Maj. Andre . Sir , I thank you . It may be of service indeed .</p>
   <p>Arnold . I will write it immediately . There , sir ; and here is the packet . I will not detain you , because I know the business requires dispatch . You will , however , sup with me , and take a glass of wine before you go .</p>
   <p>Maj. Andre . I shall hardly have time ; however , I will wait half an hour .</p>
   <p>Arnold . Walk with me into this other apartment ; we soldiers do not stand upon ceremony . But how do you carry these papers so as to conceal them in case you meet with any over-curious persons ?</p>
   <p>Maj. Andre . I have an expedient . I can carry them in the foot of my boot . Do you see how snug they lie ?</p>
   <p>[ Putting them on</p>
   <p>Arnold . Aye , faith , that was well thought of ; but do not put the passport in your boot .</p>
   <p>Maj. Andre . No , no . That goes into my pocket .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 52 ]</span>Cornwallis , in command of the British army in the South , was in the early part of 1781 working his way steadily northward from South Carolina . Benedict Arnold arrived in the Chesapeake , January 2 , 1781 , and , supported by the British navy there , committed extensive ravages on the rivers and unprotected coasts of Virginia . Arnold offered to spare Richmond if he were given its stores of tobacco . The offer being rejected , the city with its tobacco was burned .</p>
   <note>53 ] The American frigate Trumbull , 20 , Captain James Nicholson , was chased off the capes of the Delaware , August 8th , 1781 , by three British cruisers . As it was blowing heavily towards night , the fore-topmast of the Trumbull was carried away by a squall , bringing down with it , on deck , the main-topgallant mast . About ten o'clock at night , one of the British vessels , the Iris , 32 , came up and closed with her while still encumbered with the wreck . “ In the midst of rain and squalls , in a tempestuous night , with most of the forward hamper of the ship over her bows , or lying on the forecastle , with one of the arms of the fore-topsail yard run through her fore-sail , and the other jammed on deck , and with a disorganized crew , Captain Nicholson found himself compelled to go to quarters , or to strike without resistance . He preferred the first ; but the English volunteers , instead of obeying orders , went below , extinguished the lights , and secreted themselves . Near half of the remainder of the people imitated this example , and Captain Nicholson could not muster fifty of even the diminished crew he had , at the guns . The battle that followed might almost be said to have been fought by the officers . These brave men , sustained by a party of the petty officers and seamen , managed a few of the guns for more than an hour , when the General Monk , 18 , coming up and joining in the fire of the Iris , the Trumbull submitted . ” — Cooper 's Naval History .— [ Duyckinck 's note , ed . of 1865 .</note>

   <p>In the issue of the Freeman 's Journal of October 24 , 1781 , the editor voiced his joy by printing the following in huge letters , that covered more than half of the first page of the paper :</p>

   <p>That on the 17th day of October , 1781 , Lieut . General Charles Earl Cornwallis with above 5000 British troops surrendered themselves prisoners of war to his excellency Gen. George Washington , commander in chief of the allied forces of France and America .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 104 ]</span>First published in the Freeman 's Journal , November 21 , 1781 . The patriot army under Greene spent the summer of 1781 in the High Hills of Santee , in South Carolina . “ On the 22d of August , Greene broke up his camp very quietly and started out on the last of his sagacious campaigns .... By vigilant scouting parties , he so completely cut off the enemy 's means of information that Stuart remained ignorant of his approach until he was close at hand . The British commander then fell back on Eutaw Springs , about fifty miles from Charleston , where he waited in a strong position . The battle of Eutaw Springs may be resolved into two brief actions between sunrise and noon of the 8th of September , 1781 . In the first action the British line was broken and driven from the field . In the second , Stuart succeeded in forming a new line , supported by a brick house and palisaded garden , and from this position Greene was unable to drive him . It has therefore been set down as a British victory . If so , it was a victory followed the next evening by the hasty retreat of the victors , who were hotly pursued by Marion and Lee . ” — Fiske .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 120 ]</span>First published in the Freeman 's Journal , January 9 , 1782 , with the following introduction : “ On Wednesday evening , the 2d instant [ January 2 , 1782 ] Alex . Quesnay , Esq ., exhibited a most elegant entertainment at the playhouse , where were present his excellency Gen. Washington , the Minister of France , the President of the State , a number of officers of the army , and a brilliant assemblage of ladies and gentlemen of the city who were invited . After a prologue suitable to the occasion , EUGENIE , an elegant French comedy , was first presented ( written by the celebrated M. Beaumarchais ) , and in the opinion of several good judges was extremely well acted by the young gentlemen students in that polite language . After the comedy was acted the LYING VARLET , a farce ; to this succeeded several curious dances , followed by a brilliant illumination , consisting of thirteen pyramidal pillars , representing the thirteen States ,— on the middle column was seen a cupid , supporting a laurel crown over the motto , ‘ WASHINGTON , the pride of his Country and terror of Britain . ’ On the summit was the word Virginia , on the right Connecticut , with the names GREENE and LA FAYETTE , on the left the word Pennsylvania , with the names WAYNE and STEUBEN , and so on according to the birthplace and State proper to each general . The spectacle ended with an artificial illumination of the thirteen columns . ”</p>
   <p>The prologue , written at the request of Mr. Quesnay , is as above .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 121 ]</span>In the 1786 version , which was reprinted verbatim from the newspaper , this read “ Great Sir , ” with the foot-note , “ Addressed to His Excellency General Washington , ” and the rest of the poem was made to refer solely to him . In the later versions this was changed so as to read , “ Addressed to the Commander in Chief and several of the officers of the American army then present at the theatre in Southwark . ”</p>

He sailed in the Prince George of 98 guns to Gibralter , in the course of which cruise he saw some service under Rodney in conflict with the Spanish fleet ; and it was in this ship , accompanied by Admiral Digby , that he arrived at New York in September , 1781 . ” — Duyckinck . He was received with great enthusiasm and ceremony . In the Freeman 's Journal of January 25 , 1782 , was the following , doubtless from the pen of Freneau : “ It is observable that the arrival of Prince William Henry in New York filled the British with ‘ joy ineffable and universal . ’ The very chimney sweeps , smitten with the poetic flame , composed odes in his praise , some of which were inserted in The Royal Gazette . ” The 1809 edition was given a long French motto from Mirabeau , which Freneau translates as follows : “ The favourites of a throne bask in its sunshine , like butterflies in a fine day . Their very slaves at the foot of royalty partake of the delusion . They keep a nation under their feet , and their every folly influences and is followed by the multitude . They care not if their fathers and their nearest relatives are trampled into the dust , provided they can figure away in the circles of a court , etc . ”</p>

   <p>James Rivington , an Englishman , was a bookseller and printer in New York from 1761 until the close of the Revolution . In 1773 he published the first number of The New York Gazetteer , or the Connecticut , New Jersey , Hudson 's River and Quebec Weekly Advertiser . At the opening of the war he became a violent British partisan . His office was destroyed by the Whigs in 1775 . Two years later he established Rivington 's New York Loyal Gazette , which became the official British newspaper in America . On December 13 of the same year , he changed the name to the Royal Gazette . In the last years of the Revolution , when British success seemed more and more uncertain , Rivington began to lean toward the Whig side , but he was never trusted by the patriots , and he passed his last years in loneliness and poverty .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>“ Mr . Printer : The people of England at this time seem persuaded or rather deluded into the opinion that the American revolt will be quashed in the year 1786 , and under that idea it is likely will prosecute the war with vigour for some time to come . This infatuation chiefly owes its birth to a prophecy of one John Cosins , who lived in the reign of the Second Charles , importing that a certain transatlantic insurrection , and the Kirk of Scotland , will both fall to the ground in the year above mentioned . Cosins 's predictions are as follows , taken from the Royal Gazette of the 18th ult . :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ When a branch of the thistle gets over the Atlantic ,</l>
     <l n="2">And in a new world the root shall be planted ,</l>
     <l n="3">And when it doth arrive at a degree of perfection</l>
     <l n="4">It surely will breed a great insurrection .</l>
     <l n="5">In the year seventy and four the root will be polished ,</l>
     <l n="6">And in eighty and six it will be quite abolished .</l>
     <l n="7">The lily and the thistle in that year will unite ,</l>
     <l n="8">But the lion and the dun cow will put them to flight .</l>
     <l n="9">The eagle will eagerly join in the fray ,</l>
     <l n="10">But luna will clip both their wings in a day .</l>
     <l n="11">O thistle , O thistle , thy wounds will be sore .</l>
     <l n="12">Kirk and kirk government will be no more ,</l>
     <l n="13">And you 'll be abridg 'd of all civil power . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>To show that America has not been wholly destitute of oracular sages in past times , I send you the following choice words or prophetical hints of an illiterate fisherman , who died about thirty years ago at his habitation , a few miles above the mouth of the Susquehanna . I discovered the paper containing them by mere accident in tumbling over the leaves of an old book at an inn near that place . If you think the lines worth inserting in your paper , they are at your service . ”</p>
   <p>Reprinted without change in the edition of 1786 , the text of which I have followed above . In later editions the prophecy was changed somewhat to conform to historical facts .</p>

   <p>[ E ] It is hoped that such a sentiment may not be deemed wholly illiberal — Every candid person will certainly draw a line between a brave and magnanimous people , and a most vicious and vitiating government . Perhaps the following extract from a pamphlet lately published in London and republished at Baltimore ( June , 1809 ) by Mr. Bernard Dornin , will place the preceding sentiment in a fair point of view :</p>
   <p>“ A better spirit than exists in the English people , never existed in any people in the world ; it has been misdirected , and squandered upon party purposes in the most degrading and scandalous manner ; they have been led to believe that they were benefiting the commerce of England by destroying the commerce of America , that they were defending their sovereign by perpetuating the bigoted oppression of their fellow subjects ; their rulers and their guides have told them that they would equal the vigour of France by equalling her atrocity , and they have gone on , wasting that opulence , patience and courage , which if husbanded by prudent , and moderate counsels , might have proved the salvation of mankind . The same policy of turning the good qualities of Englishmen to their own destruction , which made Mr. Pitt omnipotent , continues his power to those who resemble him only in his vices ; advantage is taken of the loyalty of Englishmen , to make them meanly submissive ; their piety is turned into persecution ; their courage into useless and obstinate contention ; they are plundered because they are ready to pay , and soothed into assinine stupidity because they are full of virtuous patience . If England must perish at last , so let it be : that event is in the hands of God ; we must dry up our tears , and submit . But that England should perish swindling and stealing ; that it should perish waging war against lazar-houses and hospitals ; that it should perish persecuting with monastic bigotry ; that it should calmly give itself up to be ruined by the flashy arrogance of one man , and the narrow fanaticism of another : these events are within the power of human beings , but I did not think that the magnanimity of Englishmen would ever stoop to such degradations . ” — Freneau 's note .</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Yesterday the Hyder Ally , a vessel fitted out for the protection of this river and its trade , returned to Chester after a severe conflict with a vessel of superior force , which with great gallantry and good conduct on the part of Capt . Barney and his crew , has been captured and brought into port . The particulars of the action , as far as we have been able to collect them , are that a fleet of merchantmen , having proceeded down the bay , were met by an enemy 's frigate of forty guns , with the General Monk , Sloop of War , and Fair American , privateer ; the General Monk having eighteen nine pounders and one hundred and fifty men . The fleet endeavored to return , but were pursued by the frigate , sloop , and privateer . The Fair American being engaged with one of the fleet , and the frigate being at a considerable distance , gave the Hyder Ally an opportunity to attack the General Monk singly , which Capt . Barney embraced , and after a very close and brave attack of about thirty minutes , the General Monk surrendered to her inferior adversary . The General Monk had fifty-three men killed and wounded , among whom are most of the officers ; on board the Hyder Ally there were fifteen killed and wounded . A brig , one of the fleet , was taken , and the General Greene left engaged with the Fair American . The conduct of Capt . Barney has given the greatest satisfaction and shows him truly worthy of the trust committed to him . ”</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="85">On June 5 , 1782 , Freneau printed the following in the Journal :</l>

     <l n="86">“ Formidable , between Guadaloupe and Monpenat ,</l>
     <l n="87">April 14 , 1782 .</l>

   </lg>
   <p>“ Sir : I am this moment favoured with your excellency 's letter , and have the happiness to acquaint you that after having had a partial engagement with the enemy on the 9th , wherein 16 of my rear were prevented by calms from joining in the action , on the 12th I had the good fortune to bring them to a general action , which lasted from seven o'clock in the morning until half-past six in the afternoon , without a moment 's intermission . Count de Grasse , with the Ville de Paris and four other ships of the line and one sunk , graced the victory . The remainder of their fleet was so miserably shattered and their loss of men so very great from their having their whole army consisting of 5 , 500 men on board the ships of war , that I am convinced it will be almost impossible to put them in a condition for service for some considerable time .</p>
   <p>I am hastening with my whole fleet , etc . G. B. RODNEY . ”</p>
   <p>Freneau 's early doubts as to this victory , which was loudly proclaimed in the Royal Gazette , is evidenced not only by the poem , but by the following comment on Rodney 's letter :</p>
   <p>“ The unskilful forger of Sir George Rodney 's letter , which is pretended to have been wafted from Jamaica to Savannah and thence to Charleston , exhibits Sir George not as a British admiral , but as a saucy upstart .... To comment on this absurd forgery would be nugatory . ”</p>

The money was obtained of the Bank of North America upon the responsibility of sundry individuals ; the Hyder Ali was purchased of John W. Stanley and the command given to Capt . Barney ; a crew of volunteers , chiefly from the regular service , was engaged , and a commission of a letter of marque procured .

     <l n="77">Covered o'er his decks with dead .</l>
     <l n="78">When from their tops their dead men tumbled ,</l>

     <l n="85">Bade them quick for quarters call .</l>
     <l n="86">Then the Monk 's proud flag descended ,</l>

The essay , which might be entitled “ On the Irrationality of War , ” contained the following passage :</p>
   <p>“ They [ the Scandinavians ] imagined the chief pleasure of this immortality would be to drink beer out of bowls made of the skulls of the enemies they had slain in battle , according to the number of which every one was to be esteemed and honored in the mansions of another world . Their war songs were particularly horrible to the imagination , and full of those savage notions of valor and romantic heroism that is to this day observable in the North American Indians .... Is it possible that a being illuminated by the rays of that spiritual sun could in his senses write the following lines : they were composed ( with a great deal more ) by one of the warrior chiefs of the Scandinavians more than 800 years since , a few hours before he expired ? ”</p>

The Commander-in-chief having shown the great confidence he reposes in the Citizens of New York by trusting his Majesty 's interest there , to their Zeal , Loyalty , and Gallantry , I persuade myself that every citizen will with alacrity claim his title to a share of the Militia duty ; that none may be deprived of this , and that those whose zeal would lead them to appear whenever called for , may not be called for too often , I think proper to declare :</p>
   <p>“ That all persons are to perform the Militia duty , excepting the Ministers of God 's Word , his Majesty 's Counsellors and principal servants whose avocations to religious and civil , necessarily prevents their attendance on Military duties .</p>
   <p>“ All persons who from age or infirmity are unable to act , may do duty by substitutes , providing those they offer are judged sufficient by the Colonel of the regiment , or commanding officer of the corps to which they belong .</p>
   <p>“ If any of the Gentlemen of the learned professions find themselves so usefully employed as to be induced to avoid the honour of appearing in person , they are supposed to be judges of the importance of their own time , and may act by proper substitutes .</p>
   <p>“ As no person deserves protection in a place of which he refuses to contribute to the defence ; every person who refuses to appear when summoned to his Militia duty is to be confined in the Main-Guard by the Colonel or commanding Officer of the corps to which he belongs , where he is to be kept till further orders .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 184 ]</span>During the summer of 1782 the Freeman 's Journal waged a bitter warfare with the Independent Gazetteer , a paper which had been established in Philadelphia on April 13 , 1782 , by Eleazer Oswald . To such extremes did this quarrel go that Oswald , defeated by the more nimble pen of his adversary , at length challenged him to a duel . The above poem marks the beginning of the poetical phase of the battle . It appeared in the Journal on the 28th of August and was a reply to the following effusion published in the Gazetteer four days previously :</p>

      <l n="10">( As Clinton , Cornwallis , and Howe did before )</l>
      <l n="11">And take off the soldiers that serve for our guard ,</l>
      <l n="12">( A step that the Tories would think rather hard )</l>
      <l n="13">Yet still I surmise , for aught I can see ,</l>
      <l n="14">No Congress or Senates would meddle with me .</l>
      <l n="15">For what have I done , when we come to consider ,</l>
      <l n="16">But sold my commodities to the best bidder ?</l>
      <l n="17">If I offered to lie for the sake of a post ,</l>
      <l n="18">Was I to be blamed if the king offered most ?</l>
      <l n="19">The King 's Royal Printer !— Five hundred a year !</l>
      <l n="20">Between you and me , ‘ twas a handsome affair :</l>
      <l n="21">Who would not for that give matters a stretch ,</l>
      <l n="22">And lie back and forward , and carry and fetch ,</l>
      <l n="23">May have some pretensions to honour and fame —</l>
      <l n="24">But what are they both but the sound of a name ,</l>
      <l n="25">Mere words to deceive us , as I have found long since ,</l>
      <l n="26">Live on them a week , and you 'll find them but nonsense .</l>
      <l n="27">The late news from Charleston my mind has perplext ,</l>
      <l n="28">If that is abandoned ,— I know what goes next :</l>
      <l n="29">This city of York is a place of great note ,</l>
      <l n="30">And that we should hold it I now give my vote ;</l>
      <l n="31">But what are our votes against Shelburne 's<span type="note_anchor">[ 211 ]</span>decrees ?</l>
      <l n="32">These people at helm steer us just where they please ,</l>
      <l n="33">So often they 've had us all hands on the brink ,</l>
      <l n="34">They 'll steer us at last to the devil , I think :</l>
      <l n="35">And though in the danger themselves have a share ,</l>

      <l n="39">And gain to themselves an immortal renown</l>
      <l n="40">By all turning soldiers , and keeping the town :</l>
      <l n="41">Whoe'er was the Tory that struck out the plan ,</l>

      <l n="43">But our words on this subject need be very few —</l>
      <l n="44">Already I see that it never will do :</l>
      <l n="45">For , suppose a few ships should be left us by Britain ,</l>
      <l n="46">With Tories to man them , and other things fitting ,</l>
      <l n="47">In truth we should be in a very fine box ,</l>
      <l n="48">As well they might guard us with ships on the stocks ,</l>
      <l n="49">And when I beheld them aboard and afloat ,</l>
      <l n="50">I am sure I should think of the bear in the boat . [ A ]</l>

      <l n="53">Shall we quit our young princes and full blooded peers ,</l>
      <l n="54">And bow down to viscounts and French chevaliers ?</l>

      <l n="58">I 'll be boil 'd into soup before I 'll live there :</l>
      <l n="59">Is it thus that our monarch his subjects degrades ?—</l>

      <l n="61">Of all the vile countries that ever were known</l>

      <l n="66">To sing like the Jews at the river Euphrates ,</l>
      <l n="67">And , after surmounting the rage of the billows ,</l>
      <l n="68">Hang ourselves up at last with our harps on the willows ;</l>
      <l n="69">Ere I sail for that shore , may I take my last nap —</l>
      <l n="70">Why , it gives me the palsy to look on its map !</l>
      <l n="71">And he that goes there ( though I mean to be civil )</l>
      <l n="72">May fairly be said to have gone to the devil .</l>
      <l n="73">Shall I push for Old England , and whine at the throne ?</l>
      <l n="74">Indeed ! they have Jemmies enough of their own !</l>
      <l n="75">Besides , such a name I have got from my trade ,</l>

      <l n="77">Thus scheme as I will , or contrive as I may ,</l>
      <l n="78">Continual difficulties rise in the way :</l>

      <l n="80">What is it to Jemmy who stands at the helm ?</l>
      <l n="81">I 'll petition the rebels ( if York is forsaken )</l>
      <l n="82">For a place in their Zion which ne'er shall be shaken</l>

   <p>[ B ] “ On the 4th of November last , the clergy and select men of Boston paraded through the streets after a crucifix , and joined in a procession in praying for a departed soul out of Purgatory ; and for this they gave the example of Congress , and other American leaders , on a former occasion at Philadelphia , some of whom , in the height of their zeal , even went so far as to sprinkle themselves with what they call Holy water . ” — Royal Gazette , of December 11 inst .— Freneau 's note .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 209 ]</span>Published in the Freeman 's Journal , December , 1782 , in two installments and inserted without change in the edition of 1786 . The first installment bore the motto “ Inclusus poenam expectat .— Virg ., ” and the second the motto “ Incertus quo fata ferant , quo sistere detur .— Virg . ” Almost no change was made in the text for the later editions . Rivington bore this attack with coolness ; he calmly inserted the first installment of the poem in his Royal Gazette for December 14 , and gave to it the following introduction : “ Mr. Rivington , having been applied to by many gentlemen for a pleasant publication respecting himself , exhibited in the Philadelphia Freeman 's Journal , of December 4th , takes leave to copy it into this Day 's Gazette , and assures the Author that a Column shall at any time be most cheerfully reserved to convey that Gentleman 's lively Lucubrations to the Public . ”</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 211 ]</span>Shelburne was at the head of the British ministry but seven months , yet in that time , by his firmness and zeal , he accomplished a final settlement of the quarrel with the colonies . “ The treaty , ” says Bancroft , “ which ruled the fate of a hemisphere was mainly due to Lord Shelburne . ”</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 212 ]</span>The Freeman 's Journal of April 24 and May 1 , 1782 , gives full details of the Huddy affair . I can do no better than to quote Freneau 's own version of the episode contributed to the Journal for June 12 :</p>
   <p>“ Capt . Huddy , of the Jersey militia , was attacked in a small fort on Tom 's river , by a party of refugees in the British pay and service , was made prisoner , together with his company , carried to New York , and lodged in the provost of that city ; about three weeks after which , he was taken out of the provost down to the water side , put into a boat and brought again to the Jersey shore , and there , contrary to the practice of all nations but savages , was hung up on a tree [ April 8 , 1782 ] and left hanging until found by our people , who took him down and buried him .</p>
   <p>“ The inhabitants of that part of the country where the murder was committed , sent a deputation to general Washington , with a full and certified state of the fact . Struck as every human breast must be , with such outrage , and determined both to punish and prevent it for the future , the general represented the case to general Clinton , who then commanded , and demanded that the refugee officer who ordered and attended the execution , and whose name is Lippencut , should be delivered up as a murderer , and in case of refusal that the person of some British officer should suffer in his stead . The demand , though not refused , has not been complied with , and the melancholy lot ( not by selection , but by casting lots ) has fallen upon captain Asgil of the guards , who , as I have already mentioned , is on his way from Lancaster to camp , a martyr to the general wickedness of the cause he engaged in , and the ingratitude of those he has served . ”</p>
   <p>Asgill was finally released .</p>

     <l n="4">According to custom , once more I appear</l>
     <l n="5">With the verse you expect at the dawn of the year :</l>
     <l n="6">For at length we have got into Eighty and Three ;</l>
     <l n="7">And in spite of proud Britain , are happy and free .</l>
     <l n="8">If the times have been hard , and our commerce gone wrong ,</l>
     <l n="9">We still have been able to struggle along .</l>
     <l n="10">If some , through misfortunes , are slack in the purse ,</l>
     <l n="11">It is not so bad but it might have been worse .</l>
     <l n="12">Great things , the year past , were reveal 'd to our eyes :</l>
     <l n="13">The Dutch have confess 'd us their friends and allies ;</l>
     <l n="14">And humbled the pride of our haughty invaders ,</l>
     <l n="15">By fighting their fleets and destroying their traders ,</l>
     <l n="16">If the English succeeded in taking the Count ,</l>
     <l n="17">To what , in the end , did their conquest amount ?</l>
     <l n="18">With their boasts , and their brags , and their shouts of applause ,</l>
     <l n="19">It but sav 'd them from ruin — not ruin 'd our cause .</l>
     <l n="20">But leaving the weight of political cares</l>
     <l n="21">To those , who are plac 'd at the helm of affairs ,</l>
     <l n="22">To the humours of fortune in all things resign 'd ,</l>
     <l n="23">I mean by my visit to put you in mind ,</l>

     <l n="25">With the news of the day I have knock 'd at your gate ,</l>
     <l n="26">And gave you to know what the world was a doing ,</l>
     <l n="27">What Louis intended , or George was a brewing .</l>
     <l n="28">If sometimes the papers were trifling and flat ,</l>
     <l n="29">And the news went against us ,— I cou'dn ' t help that ;</l>
     <l n="30">If parties were angry , and vented their spite ,</l>
     <l n="31">I bro't you their wranglings — not help 'd them to write .</l>
     <l n="32">I therefore presume ( and not without reason )</l>
     <l n="33">You 'll remember your Newsman , and think of the season ;</l>
     <l n="34">The markets are high , and the weather is cold ;</l>
     <l n="35">No party I serve , and no pension I hold .</l>
     <l n="36">We Hawkers are men , and have children and wives</l>
     <l n="37">To comfort our hearts , and to solace our lives :</l>
     <l n="38">But if I say more , you 'll think it is stuff ;</l>

     <l n="15">Full early in youth , without basket or burden ,</l>
     <l n="16">With a staff in my hand , I passed over Jordan ,</l>
     <l n="17">( I remember my comrade was doctor Magraw , [ D ]</l>
     <l n="18">And many strange things on the waters we saw ,</l>
     <l n="19">Sharks , dolphins , and sea-dogs , bonettas , and whales ,</l>

     <l n="21">And came to your city and government seat ,</l>
     <l n="22">And found it was true you had something to eat ;</l>
     <l n="23">When thus I wrote home — “ The country is good ,</l>
     <l n="24">“ They have plenty of victuals and plenty of wood :</l>
     <l n="25">“ The people are kind , and , whatever they think ,</l>

     <l n="30">So said , and so acted — I put up a press ,</l>
     <l n="31">And printed away with amazing success ;</l>
     <l n="32">Neglected my person , and looked like a fright ,</l>

     <l n="38">Ned Weyman was printer , you know to the king ,</l>

     <l n="40">( Though riches not always attend on a throne )</l>
     <l n="41">So he swore I had found the philosopher 's stone ,</l>
     <l n="42">And called me a rogue , and a son of a bitch ,</l>
     <l n="43">Because I knew better than him to get rich .</l>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 214 ]</span>First published in the Freeman 's Journal in several installments , the first appearing Jan. 8 , 1783 . Hugh Gaine began as a printer in New York in 1750 , and two years later established the New York Mercury . His imprint for many years was “ Printed by Hugh Gaine , Printer , Bookseller , Stationer , at the Bible and Crown , in Hanover Square . ” Upon the beginning of hostilities with England he at first sided with the patriots . “ Gaine 's political creed it seems was to join the strongest party . When the British troops were about to take possession of New York in 1776 , he left the city and set up his press at Newark ; but soon after , in the belief that appearances were against the ultimate success of the United States , be privately withdrew from Newark and returned to New York . At the conclusion of the war , he petitioned the State legislature for leave to remain in the city and , having obtained permission , his press was employed in book printing , etc ., but his newspaper was discontinued when the British army left . ” — Thomas ’ History of Philadelphia .

   <p>Dark glooms the day that sees me leave this shore , To which fate whispers I must come no more : From civil broils what dire disasters flow — Those broils condemn me to a land of woe Where barren pine trees shade the dreary steep , Frown o'er the soil or murmur to the deep , Where sullen fogs their heavy wings expand , And nine months ’ winter chills the dismal land ! Could no kind stars have mark 'd a different way , Stars that presided on my natal day ?— Why is not man endued with power to know The ends and upshots of events below ? Why did not heaven ( some other gift deny 'd ) Teach me to take the true-born Buckskin side , Show me the balance of the wavering fates And fortune smiling on these new-born States ! Friend of my heart !— my refuge and relief , Who help 'd me on through seven long years of grief , Whose better genius taught you to remain In the soft quiet of your rural reign , Who still despised the Rebels and their cause , And , while you paid the taxes , damn 'd their laws , And wisely stood spectator of the fray , Nor trusted George , whate'er he chose to say ; Thrice happy thou , who wore a double face , And as the balance turn 'd could each embrace ; Too happy Janus ! had I shar 'd thy art , To speak a language foreign to my heart , And stoop 'd from pomp and dreams of regal state , To court the friendship of the men I hate , These strains of woe had not been penn 'd to-day , Nor I to foreign climes been forc 'd away : Ah ! George — that name provokes my keenest rage , Did he not swear , and promise , and engage His loyal sons to nurture and defend , To be their God , their father and their friend — Yet basely quits us on a hostile coast , And leaves us wretched where we need him most : His is the part to promise and deceive , By him we wander and by him we grieve ; Since the first day that these dissentions grew , When Gage to Boston brought his blackguard crew ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 239 ]</span>From place to place we urge our vagrant flight To follow still this vapour of the night , From town to town have run our various race , And acted all that 's mean and all that 's base — Yes — from that day until this hour we roam , Vagrants forever from our native home ! And yet , perhaps , fate sees the golden hour When happier hands shall crush rebellious power , When hostile tribes their plighted faith shall own And swear subjection to the British throne , When George the Fourth shall their petitions spurn , And banish 'd Tories to their fields return . From dreams of conquest , worlds and empires won Britain awaking , mourns her setting sun , No rays of joy her evening hour illume , ‘ Tis one sad chaos , one unmingled gloom ! Too soon she sinks unheeded to the grave , No eye to pity and no hand to save : What are her crimes that she alone must bend ? Where are her hosts to conquer and defend — Must she alone with these new regions part , These realms that lay the nearest to her heart , But soar 'd at once to independent power , Not sunk like Scotland in the trying hour ?— See slothful Spaniards golden empires keep , And rule vast realms beyond the Atlantic deep ; Must we alone surrender half our reign , And they their empires and their worlds retain ? Britannia , rise — send Johnstone to Peru , Seize thy bold thunders and the war renew , Conquest or ruin — one must be thy doom , Strike — and secure a triumph or a tomb ! But we , sad outcasts from our native reign , Driven from these shores , a poor deluded train , In distant wilds , conducted by despair , Seek , vainly seek , a hiding place from care ! Even now yon ’ tribes , the foremost of the band , Croud to the ships and cover all the strand : Forc 'd from their friends , their country , and their God , I see the unhappy miscreants leave the sod ! Matrons and men walk sorrowing side by side And virgin grief , and poverty , and pride , All , all with aching hearts prepare to sail And late repentance that has no avail ! While yet I stand on this forbidden ground I hear the death-bell of destruction sound , And threat'ning hosts with vengeance on their brow Cry , “ Where are Britain 's base adherents now ? ” These , hot for vengeance , by resentment led , Blame on our hearts the failings of the head ; To us no peace , no favours they extend , Their rage no bounds , their hatred knows no end ; In one firm league I see them all combin 'd , We , like the damn 'd , can no forgiveness find — As soon might Satan from perdition rise , And the lost angels gain their vanish 'd skies As malice cease in their dark souls to burn , Or we , once fled , be suffer 'd to return . Curs 'd be the union that was form 'd with France , I see their lillies and the stars advance ! Did they not turn our triumphs to retreats , And prove our conquests nothing but defeats ?— My heart misgives me as their chiefs draw near , I feel the influence of all potent fear , Henceforth must I , abandon 'd and distrest , Knock at the door of pride , a beggar guest , And learn from years of misery and pain Not to oppose fair Freedom 's cause again !— One truth is clear from changes such as these ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 240 ]</span>Kings cannot always conquer when they please , Nor are they rebels who mere freedom claim , Conquest alone can ratify the name — But great the task , their efforts to controul When genuine virtue fires the stubborn soul ; The warlike beast in Lybian deserts plac 'd To reign the master of the sun-burnt waste , Not tamely yields to bear a servile chain , Force may attempt it , and attempt in vain , Nervous and bold , by native valour led , His prowess strikes the proud invader dead , By force nor fraud from freedom 's charms beguil 'd He reigns secure the monarch of the wild .

     <l n="3">Here are no blazing brimstone lakes — ‘ tis true ;</l>

   <p>“ It is believed that Robert Bell , an Englishman or a Scotchman , who came to Philadelphia about 1772 or 1773 , was the first person who kept a circulating library in this city . He had his place of business in Third street below Walnut . He was also one of the first to establish book auctions here , in which effort he met very serious opposition from the booksellers . He published several works prior to the Revolutionary War , but during that struggle he seems to have left the city . He died in Richmond , Va ., Sept. 26 , 1784 . ” — Watson 's Annals .</p>

The year 1782 , in which Cavallo made his memorable experiments , may be taken as the initial date in the history of aerial navigation . In October , 1753 , Rozier ventured upon the first balloon ascension , though he ventured only fifty feet from the ground . On November 21st of the same year , with the Marquis d'Arlandes , he made the first aerial expedition , ascending from the castle la Muette in the presence of a vast multitude and remaining in the air twenty-five minutes .

   <p>“ On Saturday morning last [ March 5 ] departed this life in the forty-third year of his age , GENERAL JOSEPH REED , Esq ., formerly President of this State ; and on Sunday his remains were interred in the Presbyterian burying ground in Arch Street . His funeral was attended by his excellency the President and the Superior Executive Council , the Honourable the Speaker and the General Assembly , the Militia Officers and a greater number of citizens than we 've ever seen here on any similar occasion . ” Text follows the edition of 1809 .</p>
   <p>Reed was one of the leading figures of the Revolutionary era . As delegate to the Continental Congress , aide and secretary to Washington , Adjutant General , volunteer soldier , and Governor of Pennsylvania , he was an active and able man , and his early death was much regretted .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 320 ]</span>Freneau doubtless wrote this poem in Charleston , S. C ., in July , 1786 . It appeared first in the Freeman 's Journal , August 2 , 1786 , and was republished in the edition of 1788 , and in the later editions , almost without change . The poet probably refers to the Rhododendron Viscosum , or as some call it the Asalia viscosun since it is the only flower popularly known as the wild honeysuckle that is both white and fragrant . According to Chapman 's Southern Flora , it flowers in the latitude of Charleston in July and August . The text is from the edition of 1809 .</p>

     <l n="6">Truths long concealed , that now all climes shall know</l>
     <l n="7">Here , like the blaze of our material sun ,</l>

     <l n="13">And still subservient to the Almighty plan ,</l>

     <l n="26">Revolves the seasons , and sustains the year !—</l>
     <l n="27">Pure light of Truth ! where'er thy splendours shine ,</l>
     <l n="28">Thou art the image of the power divine ;</l>
     <l n="29">Nought else , in life , that full resemblance bears ,</l>

     <l n="40">Beneath whose view perpetual day-light shines ;</l>
     <l n="41">At whose command all worlds their circuits run ,</l>
     <l n="42">And night , retiring , dies before the sun !</l>
     <l n="43">Here , Man no more disgraced by Time appears ,</l>
     <l n="44">Lost in dull slumbers through ten thousand years ;</l>
     <l n="45">Plunged in that gulph , whose dark unfathomed wave</l>
     <l n="46">Men of all ages to perdition gave ;</l>
     <l n="47">An empty dream , or still more empty shade ,</l>
     <l n="48">The substance vanished , and the form decayed :—</l>
     <l n="49">Here Reason proves , that when this life decays ,</l>
     <l n="50">Instant , new life in the warm bosom plays ,</l>
     <l n="51">As that expiring , still its course repairs</l>
     <l n="52">Through endless ages , and unceasing years .</l>
     <l n="53">Where parted souls with kindred spirits meet ,</l>
     <l n="54">Wrapt to the bloom of beauty all complete ;</l>
     <l n="55">In that celestial , vast , unclouded sphere ,</l>
     <l n="56">Nought there exists but has its image here !</l>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 325 ]</span>The first trace I can find of this poem is in the initial number of Matthew Carey 's American Museum , Jan. 1 , 1787 , where it is placed among the selected poetry and assigned to P. Freneau . This testimony of Carey 's as to its genuineness carries with it considerable weight . Knapp , who in 1829 reviewed the poem as Freneau 's , doubtless had before him a copy of the Museum . The poem , however , is not included in any of the poet 's collections and I can find no earlier newspaper appearance , although my search has not been exhaustive . The authenticity of a poem suspected to be Freneau 's may always be gravely doubted if it is not found to be included in his collected works , for he hoarded his poetic product , especially in his earlier period , with miserly care .</p>
   <p>The poem appeared in 1806 among the poems of Mrs. John Hunter with the title “ The Death Song , written for and adapted to , an original Indian air . ” Several of Mrs. Hunter 's best poems had been long in circulation before she was induced to collect them . In 1822 Maria Edgeworth introduced the poem into her book “ Rosamond , ” ascribing it to her . She added the following note : “ The idea of this ballad was suggested several years ago by hearing a gentleman who resided many years among the tribe called the Cherokees , sing a wild air , which he assured me was customary for these people to chant with a barbarous jargon implying contempt for their enemies in the moments of torture and death . I have endeavored to give something of the characteristic spirit and sentiment of those brave savages . ”</p>

     <l n="55">Did Nature , there , a heaven of pleasure shew ,</l>
     <l n="56">Could they be welcome , if not shared with you ?—</l>
     <l n="57">Lost are my toils — my longing hopes are vain :</l>
     <l n="58">Yet , ‘ midst these ills , permit me to complain ,</l>
     <l n="59">And half regret , that , finding fortune fail ,</l>
     <l n="60">I left your cottage — to direct the sail :</l>
     <l n="61">Unmoved , amidst this elemental fray ,</l>
     <l n="62">Let me , once more , the muses ’ art essay ,</l>
     <l n="63">Once more — amidst these scenes of Nature 's strife ,</l>
     <l n="64">Catch at her forms and mould them into life ;</l>
     <l n="65">By Fancy 's aid , to unseen coasts repair ,</l>
     <l n="66">And fondly dwell on absent beauty there .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">While lost so long to his Arcadian shade ,</l>
     <l n="2">Careless of fortune and of fame he stray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="3">Philander to a barbarous region came</l>
     <l n="4">And found a partner in a colder shade ,</l>
     <l n="5">Fair as Amanda ; and perhaps might claim</l>
     <l n="6">With her the impassion 'd soul , and friendship 's holy flame ;</l>
     <l n="7">For sprightly loves upon her bosom play 'd ,</l>
     <l n="8">And youth was in her blush , and every shepherd said</l>
     <l n="9">She was a modest and accomplish 'd dame .</l>
     <l n="10">What have I done , ( the wandering shepherd cry 'd )</l>
     <l n="11">Thus to be banish 'd from a face so fair ,</l>
     <l n="12">( For now the frosts had spoil 'd the daisies ’ pride ,</l>
     <l n="13">And he once more for roving did prepare )</l>
     <l n="14">Ah , what have I to do with swelling seas</l>
     <l n="15">Who once could pipe upon the hollow reed ?—</l>
     <l n="16">I take no joy in such rude scenes as these ,</l>
     <l n="17">Nor look with pleasure on the vagrant weed</l>
     <l n="18">That gulphy streams from rugged caverns bore ,</l>
     <l n="19">Which floats thro ’ every clime , and never finds a shore !</l>
     <l n="20">But other fields and other flowers were mine ,</l>
     <l n="21">‘ Till wild disorder drove me from the plain .</l>
     <l n="22">And the black dogs of war were seen to join ,</l>
     <l n="23">Howl o'er the soil , and dispossess the swain :</l>
     <l n="24">Why must I leave these climes of frost and snow ?—</l>
     <l n="25">Were it not better in these glooms to stay ,</l>
     <l n="26">And , while on high the autumnal tempests blow ,</l>
     <l n="27">Let others o'er the wild seas take their way ,</l>
     <l n="28">And I with my Livinia 's tresses play ?—</l>
     <l n="29">Ah , no , no , no ! the imperious wave demands</l>
     <l n="30">That I must leave these shores , and lose these lands</l>
     <l n="31">And southward to the high equator stray :</l>
     <l n="32">But Fancy now has lost her vernal hue ;</l>
     <l n="33">See Nature in her wintry garb array 'd —</l>
     <l n="34">And where is that fine dream which once she drew</l>
     <l n="35">While yet by Cambria 's stream she fondly play 'd !</l>
     <l n="36">Lavinia heard his long complaint , and said ,</l>
     <l n="37">Wouldst thou , for me , detain the expecting sail —?</l>
     <l n="38">Go , wanderer , go — the trees have lost their shade ,</l>
     <l n="39">And my gay flowers are blasted by the gale ,</l>
     <l n="40">And the bright stream is chill 'd that wandered thro ’ the vale :</l>
     <l n="41">Ah , why , Philander , do you sigh , so sad !</l>
     <l n="42">Why all this change in such a jovial lad ?</l>
     <l n="43">Smooth seas shall be your guard , and , free from harms ,</l>
     <l n="44">Restore you , safely , to Lavinia 's arms !</l>
     <l n="45">Or should the eastern tempest rend your sail ,</l>
     <l n="46">Trust me , dear shepherd , should the seas prevail ,</l>
     <l n="47">And you be laid in Neptune 's cradle low ,</l>
     <l n="48">The winds will bring me back the woeful tale</l>
     <l n="49">When I must to the long shore weeping go ,</l>
     <l n="50">And while I see the ruffian surge aspire ,</l>
     <l n="51">Some consolation will it be to know</l>
     <l n="52">No pain or anguish can afflict the head</l>
     <l n="53">The limbs or stomach , when the heart is dead .</l>

     <l n="54">Thus long discoursing , on the bank they stood ,</l>

     <l n="56">While the broad topsails , from the yards unfurl 'd ,</l>
     <l n="57">Shook in the wind , and summon 'd him away ;</l>
     <l n="58">Brisk blew the gales , and curl 'd the yielding flood ,</l>
     <l n="59">Nor had he one excuse to urge his stay —</l>
     <l n="60">Be chang 'd ( he said ) ye winds that blow so fair ;</l>
     <l n="61">Why do not tempests harrow up the deep ,</l>

     <l n="63">To the bleak shore the parting lovers came ,</l>
     <l n="64">And while Philander did his sighs renew ,</l>
     <l n="65">So near the deep they bade their last farewell</l>
     <l n="66">That the rough surge , to quench the mutual flame</l>
     <l n="67">Burst in and broke the embrace , and o'er Lavinia flew ;</l>
     <l n="68">While a dark cloud hung lowering o'er the main ,</l>

     <l n="79">Then to a neighbouring hill the nymph withdrew ,</l>

     <l n="167">And , tho ’ it were hard that the sea-fish should tear him ,</l>
     <l n="168">I 'm fully convinc 'd that his brethren can spare him :</l>
     <l n="169">“ But were I to mention the very best way ,</l>
     <l n="170">And the quickest to boot ( for they go in a day )</l>
     <l n="171">I would sleep over night at the sign of the Queen , [ I ]</l>
     <l n="172">( Where the wine is so good , and the beds are so clean )</l>
     <l n="173">Then starting by day-break , and riding in state ,</l>
     <l n="174">Arriving in Bristol — we breakfast at eight ,</l>
     <l n="175">Then push on our way , with a rapid career ,</l>
     <l n="176">With nothing to hinder , and nothing to fear ,</l>
     <l n="177">Till Trenton , and Princeton , and Brunswick are pass 'd ,</l>
     <l n="178">And safe on the Hudson they drop us at last . ”</l>
     <l n="179">When the captain had finish 'd , the Frenchman arose ,</l>
     <l n="180">And smoothing his whiskers , and squaring his toes ,</l>
     <l n="181">With a bend of his back , and a swing of his head</l>
     <l n="182">Thus expressing his wish , with a flourish , he said :</l>
     <l n="183">“ Wherever pomatums are most in demand</l>
     <l n="184">That route has my vote , be it water or land :</l>
     <l n="185">Wherever I travel , through sun-shine or glooms ,</l>
     <l n="186">May fortune direct me to powders and plumes !—</l>
     <l n="187">So , gentlemen , choose , I beseech you , that road</l>
     <l n="188">Where ladies prefer to be dress 'd in the mode . ”</l>
     <l n="189">“ Hold , varlet , be still ” — said the Yankee attorney ,</l>
     <l n="190">“ Are you to decide on the route of our journey ?</l>
     <l n="191">These run-about fellows , I cannot but hate ‘ em ,</l>
     <l n="192">With their rings , and their ruffles , and rolls of pomatum :</l>
     <l n="193">But , gentlemen , ( if I may venture to speak</l>

     <l n="196">Who thought I was holy because I was black ;</l>
     <l n="197">Or , if you allow me a moral to draw</l>
     <l n="198">From some words that were frequent with Doctor Magraw ) ;—</l>
     <l n="199">“ We all have in view to arrive at one town ,</l>
     <l n="200">“ Yet each one would find out a way of his own ;</l>
     <l n="201">“ What a pity it is that we cannot agree</l>
     <l n="202">“ To march all together to Zion ” — said he —</l>
     <l n="203">But , since I 'm convinc 'd that it cannot be so ,</l>
     <l n="204">( For his journey resembles our journey below )</l>
     <l n="205">Like the sects in religion , I heartily pray</l>
     <l n="206">That each , as he pleases , may have his own way ,</l>
     <l n="207">Let Snip , and the captain , adventure by land ,</l>
     <l n="208">The sailor by sea — he can reef , steer , and hand ;</l>
     <l n="209">Let the Frenchman set out in a gaudy balloon ,</l>
     <l n="210">( He 'll either be there , or be dead , very soon ,)</l>
     <l n="211">For my own part , I 'm fond of the Burlington boat ,</l>
     <l n="212">But still , if you 're willing , I 'll put it to vote :</l>
     <l n="213">The hint was sufficient — he put it to vote ,</l>
     <l n="214">And fate bade us go with the Burlington boat .</l>

     <l n="218">The morning was fair , and the wind was at west ,</l>
     <l n="219">The flood coming in , and the ladies were drest ;</l>
     <l n="220">At the sign of the Billet we all were to meet ,</l>
     <l n="221">And Snip was the first that appear 'd in the street ;</l>
     <l n="222">He strutted along with a mighty brisk air ,</l>
     <l n="223">While Sam and Snipinda walked slow in the rear .</l>
     <l n="224">Dress 'd , booted , and button 'd , and “ cutting a shine ”</l>
     <l n="225">The captain came next , with his loaded carbine ;</l>

     <l n="227">The barber and ballad-man longer delay 'd</l>
     <l n="228">For one had his ballads to sing and to play ,</l>
     <l n="229">And the other some beards to take off by the way :</l>
     <l n="230">At last they arriv 'd , and the sailor along ,</l>
     <l n="231">( But he was besotted — his dram had been strong —)</l>
     <l n="232">The lawyer , Ezekiel , was last to appear ,</l>
     <l n="233">With a cane in his hand and a quill at his ear .</l>
     <l n="234">But , just as we all were prepar 'd to embark ,</l>

     <l n="271">Coop 'd up in a waggon , the curtains let down ,</l>
     <l n="272">At three in the morning we drove out of town :</l>
     <l n="273">A morning more dark I ne'er saw in my life ,</l>
     <l n="274">And the fog you might almost have cut with a knife ,</l>
     <l n="275">It was a fit season for murders and rapes ,</l>
     <l n="276">For drunken adventures and narrow escapes :—</l>
     <l n="277">So , with something to think of , but little to say ,</l>
     <l n="278">The driver drove on , looking out for the way ,</l>
     <l n="279">‘ Till we came to the brow of a horrible hill ,</l>
     <l n="280">Six miles on our road , when the cattle stood still —</l>
     <l n="281">“ Are you sure you have took the right road ? ” — queried Snip ;</l>
     <l n="282">“ I am ” — said the driver — and crack 'd with his whip .</l>
     <l n="283">Then away ran the horses , but took the wrong road ,</l>
     <l n="284">And away went the waggon , with all its full load ;</l>
     <l n="285">Down , deep in a valley , roll 'd over and over ,</l>
     <l n="286">Fell the flying-machine , with its curtains and cover ,</l>
     <l n="287">Where shatter 'd and shiver 'd — no glimpse yet of day ,</l>
     <l n="288">A mass of destruction , together we lay !</l>
     <l n="289">Then howlings were heard , that would frighten a stone ,</l>
     <l n="290">And screeching , and screaming , and many a groan ,</l>
     <l n="291">The bruising of heads , and the breaking of shins ,</l>
     <l n="292">Contrition of heart , and confession of sins .</l>
     <l n="293">First rose from his ruins tall captain O'Keef ,</l>
     <l n="294">And call 'd to Ezekiel , and begg 'd for his brief :[ J ]</l>
     <l n="295">A writ he demanded , as soon as ‘ twas day ,</l>
     <l n="296">And ask 'd his advice , if a suit would not lay ?</l>
     <l n="297">Then felt for his sword , but chanc 'd on a cane ,</l>
     <l n="298">And rush 'd at the stageman , to cleave him in twain .</l>
     <l n="299">As fortune would have it , the stageman had fled ,</l>
     <l n="300">And Snip the whole vengeance receiv 'd on his head ;</l>
     <l n="301">The staff had been whirl 'd with so deadly a sweep</l>
     <l n="302">Poor Will in a moment was all in a heap :</l>
     <l n="303">There was room to surmise that his senses were hurt ,</l>
     <l n="304">For , in spite of our bruises , he made us some sport :</l>
     <l n="305">His head , he conceited , was made of new cheese ;</l>
     <l n="306">And ask 'd , if the sexton would give up his fees ?—</l>
     <l n="307">Then , rolling away on the side of the hill ,</l>
     <l n="308">With his head in a horse-pond , he lay very still :</l>
     <l n="309">At last he bawl 'd out — “ I 'm sick at my heart !</l>
     <l n="310">Come hither , companions , and see me depart !</l>
     <l n="311">Snipinda , Snipinda !— alas , I must leave her —</l>
     <l n="312">And all , for the sake of this villainous weaver ,</l>
     <l n="313">Who never would give me a moment of rest</l>
     <l n="314">‘ Till I left my dear shop-board , and thus am distrest !</l>
     <l n="315">But a time will arrive ( if I deem not amiss )</l>
     <l n="316">When Slender , the weaver , will suffer for this —</l>
     <l n="317">May his breeches , be always too big for his wear ,</l>
     <l n="318">Or so narrow and scant as to torture his rear ;</l>
     <l n="319">May his waistcoat be ever too long or too short ,</l>
     <l n="320">And the skirts of his tunic not both of a sort ;—</l>
     <l n="321">And , when from this sorrowful jaunt you return ,</l>
     <l n="322">Tell Doctor Sangrado ‘ tis needless to mourn :</l>
     <l n="323">Ah ! tell him I firmly believ 'd I was going</l>
     <l n="324">Where people no longer are wed-ding and wooing ,</l>
     <l n="325">Where white linen stockings will ever be clean ,</l>
     <l n="326">And sky-men are clad in the best of nankeen ;</l>
     <l n="327">Where with old Continental our debts we can pay ,</l>
     <l n="328">And a suit of best broad-cloth will last but a day ;</l>
     <l n="329">Where with pretty brass thimbles the streets are all pav 'd ,</l>
     <l n="330">And a remnant — if not a whole piece — shall be sav 'd ,</l>
     <l n="331">Where cloth may be cabbag 'd — and that without fear —</l>
     <l n="332">And journeymen work — thirteen months to the year ! ”</l>
     <l n="333">Snipinda was mov 'd at so dismal a yell ,</l>
     <l n="334">And groping about to find where he fell ,</l>
     <l n="335">Exclaim 'd , “ I have got a sad bruise on one hip ,</l>
     <l n="336">But matters , I fear , are much worse with poor Snip . ”</l>
     <l n="337">“ Yes , yes ” — answer 'd Snip — “ I 'm preparing to go —</l>
     <l n="338">Be speedy , Snipinda , my pulse is so low ! ”</l>
     <l n="339">Then she went where he lay , and took hold of his head ,</l>
     <l n="340">And whisper 'd the captain , “ how much he has bled ! ”</l>
     <l n="341">( For she thought , as he lay with his nose in the puddle ,</l>
     <l n="342">That the water was blood , that had flow 'd from his noddle . )</l>
     <l n="343">“ Ah ! where is the doctor , to give him a pill ;</l>
     <l n="344">And where is the Lawyer , to write his last-will ?</l>
     <l n="345">Ezekiel ! Ezekiel ! attend to his words ;</l>
     <l n="346">If I am his widow , I must have my thirds !</l>
     <l n="347">But can you ” — and here she reclin 'd on his breast —</l>
     <l n="348">“ And can you resolve to forsake me distrest ,</l>
     <l n="349">Is it thus you would quit me , my joy and my love ,</l>
     <l n="350">And leave me alone for the shop-boards above :</l>
     <l n="351">Is it thus you consign me to trouble and woe ?—</l>
     <l n="352">When you are departed , ah ! where shall I go ?</l>
     <l n="353">I shall then be a widow — forsaken and sad —</l>
     <l n="354">And where shall I find such another sweet lad ?</l>
     <l n="355">Who then will afford me a mint-water dram ,</l>
     <l n="356">Gallant me to meeting — and who will flog Sam ? ”</l>
     <l n="357">By this time the story was currently spread ,</l>
     <l n="358">And most were convinc 'd that the taylor was dead ,—</l>
     <l n="359">“ The taylor is dead beyond all relief !</l>

     <l n="365">If life is a race , as the learned pretend ,</l>
     <l n="366">God help him ! his racing is soon at an end :</l>
     <l n="367">His anchor is cast , and his canvas is furl 'd ;</l>
     <l n="368">A creature he was , so attach 'd to the world ,</l>
     <l n="369">So eager for money — ( I say it with grief )</l>
     <l n="370">He never consider 'd the ‘ fall of the leaf . ’</l>
     <l n="371">He is come ( we may say ) to the end of his tether</l>
     <l n="372">Where the maid and her master shall lay down together .—</l>
     <l n="373">For the place where he 's gone may we also prepare ,</l>
     <l n="374">Where the Mind , when admitted , shall rest from her care ,</l>
     <l n="375">And fiddles — the finest that ever were seen ,</l>
     <l n="376">Shall play , for his comfort , a brisk Bonny Jean .</l>
     <l n="377">“ The taylor is dead ” ( said the company round )</l>
     <l n="378">“ The taylor is dead ” — the dark forests resound .—</l>
     <l n="379">“ He is dead ! ” — blubber 'd Sam , with a counterfeit sigh —</l>
     <l n="380">When the sailor bawl 'd out — “ By my soul it 's a lie !</l>
     <l n="381">The fellow has only a mind for some fun ,</l>
     <l n="382">His blood is not cold , and his race is not run .</l>
     <l n="383">His head , it is true , may have had a small shock :</l>
     <l n="384">I 'll bind it — ‘ twill only be strapping a block :</l>
     <l n="385">Here , hand me a neck-cloth , a napkin , a clout !</l>
     <l n="386">Now — heave up his noddle , and strap it about !</l>
     <l n="387">Success to the skull that can bear a good jirk —</l>
     <l n="388">They only have damag 'd his ginger-bread work . ”</l>

     <l n="394">When the morning appear 'd , it is horrid to tell</l>
     <l n="395">What mischiefs the most of our crew had befel :</l>
     <l n="396">A bundle lay here , and a budget lay there ;</l>
     <l n="397">The Frenchman was fretting and pulling his hair ,</l>
     <l n="398">The horses were feeding about on the hill ,</l>
     <l n="399">And Snip , with his head on a hassock lay still ,</l>
     <l n="400">The driver beseech 'd us the fault to excuse ,</l>
     <l n="401">The night had been dark — and “ he lost both his shoes ” —</l>
     <l n="402">Then he rais 'd up his waggon , rejoicing to find</l>
     <l n="403">That , by leaving the top and the curtains behind ,</l>
     <l n="404">We still might proceed — for the body was sound ,</l>
     <l n="405">And the wheels , upon searching , uninjur 'd all ‘ round .</l>
     <l n="406">But dull and dishearten 'd we travell 'd along ,</l>
     <l n="407">Our waggon dismantled , our harness all wrong :</l>
     <l n="408">The lawyer was vext that we went a snail 's pace ,</l>
     <l n="409">And Cynthia was sure she had lost half her lace ;</l>
     <l n="410">While Bryan O'Bluster , who Snip had restor 'd ,</l>
     <l n="411">Asserted , that Snip was the Jonas on board ,</l>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 360 ]</span>First published in pamphlet form by Bailey , April , 1787 , under the title , “ A Journey from Philadelphia to New-York by way of Burlington and South-Amboy . By Robert Slender , Stocking Weaver . ” The advertisement in the Freeman 's Journal of April 25 declares that “ Some truth in the occasion and a good deal of fancy in the colouring mark the character of the above performance . The style is smooth and easy and the pleasurable air that is diffused over the whole piece will certainly render the whole poem acceptable to such as choose to read it . ” The poem was republished in the editions of 1788 and 1795 , the text of the latter of which I have used . It was again republished in a twenty-four page pamphlet by Thomas Neversink , Philadelphia , Dec. 20 , 1809 , under the title “ A Laughable Poem ; or Robert Slender 's Journey from Philadelphia to New York . ” The earlier versions , of which the 1788 text was a reprint , had the poem divided into four cantos . In the 1795 edition the subdivision into sections was made . Freneau thoroughly revised the poem for the 1795 edition , making very many changes , all for the better . He cut out nearly all of the indelicate allusions and expressions of the earlier edition , including the coarse but highly picturesque dialogue between the skipper and the captain , and it has seemed best to me not to resurrect them . The 1809 edition was reprinted with little change from the 1795 version .</p>

    <head>A NEWSMAN 'S ADDRESS<span type="note_anchor">[ 374 ]</span></head>
     <l n="1">Though past events are hourly read ,</l>
     <l n="2">The various labours of the dead ,</l>
     <l n="3">In vain their story we recall ,</l>
     <l n="4">The rise of empires , or the fall ;</l>
     <l n="5">Our modern men , a busy crew ,</l>
     <l n="6">Must , in their turn , have something new .</l>
     <l n="7">By moralists we have been told</l>
     <l n="8">That “ Time himself in time grows old ;</l>
     <l n="9">“ The seasons change , the moons decay ,</l>
     <l n="10">“ The sun shines weaker every day ,</l>
     <l n="11">“ Justice is from the world withdrawn ,</l>
     <l n="12">“ Virtue and friendship almost gone ,</l>
     <l n="13">“ Religion fails ( the clergy shew )</l>
     <l n="14">“ And man , alas , must vanish too . ”</l>
     <l n="15">Let others such opinions hold ,</l>
     <l n="16">( Since grumbling has been always old ;)</l>
     <l n="17">All Nature must decay , ‘ tis true ,</l>
     <l n="18">But Nature shall her face renew ,</l>
     <l n="19">Her travels in a circle make ,</l>
     <l n="20">Freeze but to thaw , sleep but to wake .</l>
     <l n="21">Die but to live , and live to die ,</l>
     <l n="22">In summer smile , in autumn sigh ,</l>
     <l n="23">Resume the garb that once she wore ,</l>
     <l n="24">Repeat the words she said before ,</l>
     <l n="25">Bow down with age , or , fresh and gay ,</l>
     <l n="26">Change , only to prevent decay .</l>
     <l n="27">As up and down , with weary feet ,</l>
     <l n="28">I travel each fatiguing street ,</l>
     <l n="29">Meeting the frowns of party men ,</l>
     <l n="30">Foes to the freedom of the pen ,</l>
     <l n="31">And to your doors our sheets convey —</l>
     <l n="32">I sometimes think I hear you say ,</l>
     <l n="33">“ Ah , were it not for what he brings ,</l>
     <l n="34">( This messenger of many things )</l>
     <l n="35">We should be in a sorry plight ;</l>
     <l n="36">The wars of Europe out of sight ,</l>
     <l n="37">No paragraphs of home affairs</l>
     <l n="38">To tell us how the fabric wears</l>
     <l n="39">Which Freedom built on Virtue 's plan ,</l>
     <l n="40">And Virtue only can maintain . ”</l>
     <l n="41">But something further you pretend ,—</l>
     <l n="42">From want of money , heaven defend !</l>
     <l n="43">Leave that to those who sleep in sheds ,</l>
     <l n="44">Or on the pavement make their beds ,</l>
     <l n="45">Who clean the streets , or carry news ,</l>
     <l n="46">Repair old coats , or cobble shoes —</l>
     <l n="47">Of every ill with which we 're curs 'd</l>
     <l n="48">This want of money is the worst :</l>
     <l n="49">This was the curse that fell on Cain ,</l>
     <l n="50">The vengeance for a brother slain :</l>
     <l n="51">For this he quit his native sod ,</l>
     <l n="52">Retreated to the land of Nod ,</l>
     <l n="53">And , in the torture of despair ,</l>
     <l n="54">Turn 'd poet , pimp , or newsman there —</l>
     <l n="55">Divines have labour 'd in the dark</l>
     <l n="56">To find the meaning of his mark :</l>
     <l n="57">How many idle things they wrote —</l>
     <l n="58">‘ Twas nothing but a ragged coat .</l>
     <l n="59">Should money , now , be scarce with you ,</l>
     <l n="60">With me , alas , ‘ tis nothing new !</l>
     <l n="61">We news-men always are in need ,</l>
     <l n="62">( So Beer and Bacchus have decreed )</l>
     <l n="63">And still your bounty shall implore</l>
     <l n="64">Till — printing presses are no more !—</l>
     <l n="65">Did we not conjure up our strain</l>
     <l n="66">The year might come and go again ,</l>
     <l n="67">Seasons advance , and moons decay ,</l>
     <l n="68">And life itself make haste away ,</l>
     <l n="69">And news-men only vex their brains</l>
     <l n="70">To have their labour for their pains —</l>
     <l n="71">Such usage I may find , ‘ tis true ,</l>
     <l n="72">But then it would be — something new !</l>

    <p>TO A DOG<span type="note_anchor">[ 376 ]</span>Occasioned by putting him on shore at the Island of Sapola , for theft Since Nature taught you , Tray , to be a thief , What blame have you , for working at your trade ? What if you stole a handsome round of beef ; Theft , in your code of laws , no crime was made . The ten commandments you had never read , Nor did it ever enter in your head : But art and Nature , careful to conceal , Disclos 'd not even the Eighth — Thou shalt not steal . Then to the green wood , caitiff , haste away : There take your chance to live — for Truth must say , We have no right , for theft , to hang up Tray .<span type="note_anchor">[ 376 ]</span>First published in the National Gazette , Nov. 3 , 1791 . Sapola Island is one of the sea-islands of McIntosh County , Georgia , forty-two miles southwest of Savannah . The somewhat unusual proceeding of putting a worthless dog on shore , instead of the more common expedient of killing him at once , is only another evidence of the poet 's kindly heart . Text from the edition of 1809 . TO LYDIA<span type="note_anchor">[ 377 ]</span>“ Tu procul a patria , ah dura ! inculta deserta , Me sine , sola videbis —— VIRG . ECLOG . Thus , safe arrived , she greets the strand , And leaves her pilot for the land ; But Lydia , why to deserts roam , And thus forsake your floating home ! To what fond care shall I resign The bosom , that must ne'er be mine : With lips , that glow beyond all art , Oh ! how shall I consent to part !— Long may you live , secure from woes , Late dying , meet a calm repose , And flowers , that in profusion grow , Bloom round your steps , where'er you go . On you all eyes delight to gaze , All tongues are lavish in your praise ; With you no beauty can compare , Nor Georgia boast one flower so fair . Could I , fair girl , transmit this page , A present , to some future age , You should through every poem shine , You , be adored in every line : From Jersey coasts too loth to sail , Sighing , she left her native vale ; Borne on a stream that met the main , Homeward she looked , and looked again . The gales that blew from off the land Most wantonly her bosom fanned , And , while around that heaven they strove , Each whispering zephyr owned his love . As o'er the seas , with you I strayed , The hostile winds our course delayed , But , proud to waft a charge so fair , To me were kind — and held you there . I could not grieve , when you complained That adverse gales our barque detained Where foaming seas to mountains grow , From gulphs of death , concealed below . When travelling o'er that lonely wave To me your feverish hand you gave , And sighing , bade me tell you , true , What lands again would rise to view ! When night came on , with blustering gale , You feared the tempest would prevail , And anxious asked , if I was sure That on those depths we sailed secure ? Delighted with a face so fair , I half forgot my weight of care , The dangerous shoal , that seaward runs , Encircled moons , and shrouded suns . With timorous heart and tearful eyes , You saw the deep Atlantic rise , Saw wintry clouds their storms prepare , And wept , to find no safety there . Throughout the long December 's night , ( While still your lamp was burning bright ) To dawn of day from evening 's close My pensive girl found no repose . Then now , at length arrived from sea , Consent , fair nymph , to stay with me — The barque — still faithful to her freight , Shall still on your direction wait . Such charms as your 's all hearts engage ! Sweet subject of my glowing page , Consent , before my Argo roves To sun-burnt isles and savage groves . When sultry suns around us glare , Your poet , still , with fondest care , To cast a shade , some folds will spread Of his coarse topsails o'er your head . When round the barque the billowy wave And howling winds , tempestuous , rave , By caution ruled , the helm shall guide Safely , that Argo o'er the tide . Whene'er some female fears prevail , At your request we 'll reef the sail , Disarm the gales that rudely blow , And bring the loftiest canvas low . When rising to harass the main Old Boreas drives his blustering train , Still shall they see , as they pursue , Each tender care employed for you . To all your questions — every sigh ! I still will make a kind reply ; Give all you ask , each whim allow , And change my style to thee and thou . If verse can life to beauty give , For ages I can make you live ; Beyond the stars , triumphant , rise , While Cynthia 's tomb neglected lies : Upon that face of mortal clay I will such lively colours lay , That years to come shall join to seek All beauty from your modest cheek . Then , Lydia , why our bark forsake ; The road to western deserts take ? That lip — on which hung half my bliss , Some savage , now , will bend to kiss ; Some rustic soon , with fierce attack , May force his arms about that neck ; And you , perhaps , will weeping come To seek — in vain — your floating home !<span type="note_anchor">[ 377 ]</span>There is a discrepancy in the dates given to this poem . It was published in the Freeman 's Journal , Sept. 3 , 1788 , with the preliminary remarks : “ The following copy of verses came accidentally into my hands . I am told that it was written by Capt . Freneau and addressed to a young Quaker lady who went passenger in his vessel to Georgia to reside in the western parts of that State . From the New York Daily Advertiser . ” It was reprinted in the 1795 edition , and in the edition of 1809 , where it has the note : “ Miss Lydia Morris , a young quaker lady , on her landing from the sloop Industry , at Savannah , in Georgia , December 30th , 1806 . ” I have followed the 1809 text . TO CYNTHIA<span type="note_anchor">[ 378 ]</span>Through Jersey<span type="note_anchor">[ 379 ]</span>groves , a wandering stream That still its wonted music keeps , Inspires no more my evening dream , Where Cynthia , in retirement , sleeps . Sweet murmuring stream ! how blest art thou To kiss the bank where she resides , Where Nature decks the beechen bough That trembles o'er your shallow tides . The cypress-tree on Hermit 's height , Where Love his soft addresses paid By Luna 's pale reflected light — No longer charms me to its shade ! To me , alas ! so far removed , What raptures , once , that scenery gave , Ere wandering yet from all I loved , I sought a deeper , drearier wave . Your absent charms my thoughts employ : I sigh to think how sweet you sung , And half adore the painted toy That near my careless heart you hung . Now , fettered fast in icy fields , In vain we loose the sleeping sail ; The frozen wave no longer yields , And useless blows the favouring gale . Yet , still in hopes of vernal showers , And breezes , moist with morning dew , I pass the lingering , lazy hours , Reflecting on the spring — and you .<span type="note_anchor">[ 378 ]</span>This poem appeared in the Freeman 's Journal , Jan. 29 , 1789 , under the title : “ Stanzas written at Baltimore in Maryland , Jan. 1789 , by Capt . P. Freneau . ” It was republished in the Daily Advertiser , Jan. 5 , 1790 , under the title “ To Harriot . ” It was used in the editions of 1795 and 1809 . The text follows the latter edition .<span type="note_anchor">[ 379 ]</span>“ Monmouth 's . ” — Ed . 1789 . “ Morven 's vale . ” — Ed . 1790 . AMANDA 'S COMPLAINT<span type="note_anchor">[ 380 ]</span>“ In shades we live , in shades we die , Cool zephyrs breathe for our repose ; In shallow streams we love to play , But , cruel you , that praise deny Which you might give , and nothing lose , And then pursue your destined way . Ungrateful man ! when anchoring here , On shore you came to beg relief ; I shewed you where the fig trees grow , And wandering with you , free from fear , To hear the story of your grief I pointed where the cisterns are , And would have shewn , if streams did flow ! The Men that spurned your ragged crew , So long exposed to Neptune 's rage — I told them what your sufferings were : Told them that landsmen never knew The trade that hastens frozen age , The life that brings the brow of care . A lamb , the loveliest of the flock , To your disheartened crew I gave , Life to sustain on yonder deep — Sighing , I cast one sorrowing look When on the margin of the main You slew the loveliest of my sheep . Along your native northern shores , From cape to cape , where'er you stray , Of all the nymphs that catch the eye , They scarce can be excelled by our 's — Not in more fragrant shades they play ;— The summer suns come not so nigh . Confess your fault , mistaken swain , And own , at least , our equal charms — Have you no flowers of ruddy hue , That please your fancy on the plain ?— Would you not guard those flowers from harm , If Nature 's self each picture drew ! Vain are your sighs — in vain your tears , Your barque must still at anchor lay , And you remain a slave to care ; A thousand doubts , a thousand fears , ‘ Till what you said , you shall unsay , Bermudian damsels are not fair !<span type="note_anchor">[ 380 ]</span>First published in the New York Daily Advertiser , Sept. 7 , 1790 , under the title , “ Written at Cape Hatteras , ” and dated June , 1789 . The last line of this version reads , “ Hatteras maidens are not fair . ” It was republished in the National Gazette , March 19 , 1792 , under the title “ Tormentina 's Complaint , ” and dated “ Castle Island , Bermuda , Jan. 20 , 1789 . ” In the 1809 edition , the text of which I have followed , it was grouped with the Amanda poems . HATTERAS<span type="note_anchor">[ 381 ]</span>In fathoms five the anchor gone ; While here we furl the sail , No longer vainly labouring on Against the western gale : While here thy bare and barren cliffs , O Hatteras , I survey , And shallow grounds and broken reefs — What shall console my stay ! The dangerous shoal , that breaks the wave In columns to the sky ; The tempests black , that hourly rave , Portend all danger nigh : Sad are my dreams on ocean 's verge ! The Atlantic round me flows , Upon whose ancient angry surge No traveller finds repose ! The Pilot comes !— from yonder sands He shoves his barque , so frail , And hurrying on , with busy hands , Employs both oar and sail . Beneath this rude unsettled sky Condemn 'd to pass his years , No other shores delight his eye , No foe alarms his fears . In depths of woods his hut he builds , Devoted to repose , And , blooming , in the barren wilds His little garden grows : His wedded nymph , of sallow hue , No mingled colours grace — For her he toils — to her is true , The captive of her face . Kind Nature here , to make him blest , No quiet harbour plann 'd ; And poverty — his constant guest , Restrains the pirate band : His hopes are all in yonder flock , Or some few hives of bees , Except , when bound for Ocracock , [ A ] Some gliding barque he sees : [ A ] All vessels from the northward that pass within Hatteras Shoals , bound for Newbern and other places on Palmico Sound , commonly in favourable weather take a Hatteras pilot to conduct them over the dangerous bar of Ocracock , eleven leagues north southwest of the cape .— Freneau 's note . His Catharine then he quits with grief , And spreads his tottering sails , While , waving high her handkerchief , Her commodore she hails : She grieves , and fears to see no more The sail that now forsakes , From Hatteras ’ sands to banks of Core Such tedious journies takes ! Fond nymph ! your sighs are heav 'd in vain ; Restrain those idle fears : Can you — that should relieve his pain — Thus kill him with your tears ! Can absence , thus , beget regard , Or does it only seem ? He comes to meet a wandering bard That steers for Ashley 's stream . Though disappointed in his views , Not joyless will we part ; Nor shall the god of mirth refuse The Balsam of the Heart : No niggard key shall lock up Joy — I 'll give him half my store Will he but half his skill employ To guard us from your shore . Should eastern gales once more awake , No safety will be here :— Alack ! I see the billows break , Wild tempests hovering near : Before the bellowing seas begin Their conflict with the land , Go , pilot , go — your Catharine join , That waits on yonder sand .<span type="note_anchor">[ 381 ]</span>Text from the edition of 1795 . The poem seems to have appeared first in the Freeman 's Journal of Dec. 9 , 1789 , with the title “ The Pilot of Hatteras , by Capt . Philip Freneau . ” Affixed was the note : “ This celebrated genius , the Peter Pindar of America , is now a master of a packet which runs between New York , Philadelphia , and Charleston . His tuneful numbers during the war did much to soften the disagreeable sensations which a state of warfare so generally occasions . ” The poem was reprinted in the National Gazette of Jan. 16 , 1792 , with the note , “ Written off the Cape , July , 1789 , on a voyage to South Carolina , being delayed sixteen days with strong gales ahead . ” The poem was omitted from the edition of 1809 . ST. CATHARINE 'S [ A ][ 382 ] [ A ] An island on the sea-coast of Georgia .— Freneau 's note . He that would wish to rove a while In forests green and gay , From Charleston bar to Catharine 's isle Might sigh to find the way ! What scenes on every side appear , What pleasure strikes the mind , From Folly 's train , thus wandering far , To leave the world behind . The music of these savage groves In simple accents swells , And freely here , their sylvan loves The feather 'd nation tells ; The panting deer through mingled shades Of oaks forever green The vegetable world invades , That skirts the watery scene . Thou sailor , now exploring far The broad Atlantic wave , Crowd all your canvas , gallant tar , Since Neptune never gave On barren seas so fine a view As here allures the eye , Gay , verdant scenes that Nature drew In colours from the sky . Ye western winds ! awhile delay To swell the expecting sail — Who would not here , a hermit , stay In yonder fragrant vale , Could he engage what few can find , That coy , unwilling guest ( All avarice banish 'd from the mind ) Contentment , in the breast !<span type="note_anchor">[ 382 ]</span>Text from the edition of 1795 . The poem seems to have appeared first in the National Gazette of Feb. 16 , 1792 , under the title , “ Lines written at St. Catharine 's Island on the coast of Georgia , November , 1789 . ” The poem is not found in the 1809 edition . TO MR. CHURCHMAN<span type="note_anchor">[ 383 ]</span>On the rejection of his Petition to the Congress of the United States , to enable him to make a voyage to BAFFIN 'S BAY , to ascertain the truth of his Variation Chart Churchman ! methinks your scheme is rather wild Of travelling to the pole Where icy billows roll , And pork and pease Are said to freeze Even at the instant they are boil 'd . Rejected , now , your humble , ardent prayer For cash , to speed your way To Baffin 's frozen bay , ‘ Tis your own fault if you repine ! You should have mention 'd some rich golden mine — Not Variation Charts , that claim no care . Avarice , alone , would sooner bid you go Than all the inducements Art can shew : The men , whom you petition for some dollars , Tho ’ willing to be thought prodigious scholars , Yet care as much for variation charts As king of spades , and knave of hearts . Churchman ! ‘ tis best to quit this vain pursuit This Variation is a common thing ! Rather attach yourself to Caesar 's wing — You 'll find it better — better , sir , by half , To sooth Pomposo 's ear — or make him laugh : So shall you , mounted in a coach and six , Ride envoy to the country of the Creeks — So shall you visit Europe 's gaudy courts , And see the polish 'd world , at public charge ; Return — and spend your life in sports , Be air 'd in coach , and sail 'd in barge :— Pursue this track , thou man of curious soul , Nor , like a whale , go puffing to the pole .<span type="note_anchor">[ 383 ]</span>This poem is found only in the 1795 edition . The Journal of the House of Representatives , 1st Congress , 1st Session , April 20 , 1789 , notes the investigations of John Churchman in regard to the magnetic needle and the determination of longitude by his method and grants to Churchman the right of exclusive use of his invention . Unfavorable report on his petition for aid to enable him to make a voyage to Baffin 's Bay to pursue his investigations of the causes of the variation of the magnetic needle . THE PROCESSION TO SYLVANIA<span type="note_anchor">[ 384 ]</span>In Life 's dull round , how often folks are cross 'd , Their projects spoil 'd , their sayings misapplied ; Some friends in woods and some in oceans lost , Some doom 'd to walk on foot , while others ride . But , now , let preachers moralize in verse , While I to yonder caravan attend That all prepar 'd , like some slow moving herse Begins its journey to an Indian land ; Bound for Sylvania !— sad , disheartening town , When thou art nam 'd how many a nymph will sigh , Sigh , lest her sweet-heart should return a clown With grizly homespun coat , long beard , and pumpkin pye . This caravan with wondrous geer is stow 'd , All sorts of moveables — straw beds , and cradles , Old records , salted fish , make up their load , With kegs of brandy , frying pans , and ladles . A pensive Printer in a one-horse chair ( Dragg 'd slowly on by sullen sleepy steed , With some ill-fated squires ) brings up the rear , Contriving future news for folks to read . To guard the whole , a trusty knight appears , With chosen men , to keep the wolves at bay : They march — and lo ! Belinda all in tears That bears must hug instead of ladies gay .<span type="note_anchor">[ 384 ]</span>Published in the Daily Advertiser , Dec. 30 , 1789 , with this introduction : “ The seat of government in South Carolina is removed by act of Assembly from Charleston to Columbia , a dismal place in the centre of that state consisting of only four houses . This removal is by many in Carolina considered as premature and amongst other animadversions has occasioned the two following poetic pieces which from several circumstances we conclude to have been written by Mr. Freneau . ” The title of the poem was originally “ The Procession to Columbia . ” It was published only in the 1795 edition . THE PILGRIM 'S PROGRESS<span type="note_anchor">[ 385 ]</span>From his obscure abode , On many a tiresome road The pilgrim , musing , took his way : Through dark and dismal groves Where the sad turtle loves To pass the night , and kill the day . In an obscure retreat , I saw the pilgrim greet , A barren soil and dreary town ;— Thy streets be-gloomed with trees With pain the traveller sees , Sylvania , barren of renown .— What can console him there ?— Not even a house of prayer With glittering spire is seen to rise — No nymphs in gaudy trim Will there be seen by him ;— No music , sermons , balls , or pigeon pies . Dull , melancholy streams , Dutch politics and schemes , Owls screeching in the empty street — Wolves howling at the doors — Bears breaking into stores ; These make the picture of the town — complete .<span type="note_anchor">[ 385 ]</span>In the Daily Advertiser of Dec. 30 , 1789 , this bore the title , “ A View of Columbia , ” and the opening line was “ From Charleston 's gay abode . ” In the 1795 edition the title was changed to “ Lysander 's Retreat . ” Text from the edition of 1809 . SANGRADO 'S EXPEDITION TO SYLVANIA<span type="note_anchor">[ 386 ]</span>Tir 'd of his journey o'er a sandy waste , Sangrado to Sylvania<span type="note_anchor">[ 387 ]</span>came at last : A bear-skin coat was round his carcase roll 'd , Shivering with northern winds ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 388 ]</span>that blew so cold : Dark was the night — much for his shins he fear 'd , For not one lamp in all the town appear 'd , Twelve was the hour — the citizens , in bed , Slept sound — of bears and wolves no more in dread ; No city-guards , no watchmen hove in sight , No chyming bell sung out the time of night ; But foggy blasts their wintry music blew Through shabby trees that round the court-house<span type="note_anchor">[ 389 ]</span>grew ; At length , alighting at one scurvy dome , He knock 'd — and hop 'd the people were at home .— Ho !— ( cry 'd the man within ) ho ! who are you ?— What ! heigh !— from Cambria ?<span type="note_anchor">[ 390 ]</span>— have you nothing new ?— Sangrado Nothing at all — the times are shameful bad ; Money at ten per cent — hard to be had : With apples and potatoes , our dear cousins The northern men , are pouring in by dozens : The French , ‘ tis said , will soon discharge their king — This , friend , is all I know — and all I bring — Citizen What ! not some oysters , gather 'd near the coast , Such as in days of old we lov 'd to roast ? Sangrado No , not an oyster — faith , you 're in a dream , To think I 'd load my little nag with them : We both are weary ; let me in , I pray , Even though you turn us out at break of day . Citizen ‘ Tis midnight now — return from whence you come — High time all honest people were at home . Sangrado Brother , me thinks my toes are somewhat cold — Unbar your door — if one may be so bold : Wet to the skin , and travelling all the day , I want some rest — open the door , I say ! Citizen Open the door , forsooth ! the man is mad : Lodging is not so easy to be had ; It is an article we do not trade in , Nor shall my bed by all the world be laid in . Our very hay-loft is as full as can be — Push off , my friend , and try your luck at Granby .<span type="note_anchor">[ 386 ]</span>Published in the Daily Advertiser , Feb. 5 , 1790 , under the title “ A Columbian Dialogue from the Charleston Gazette , supposed to have been written by Capt . Freneau . ” Text from the 1795 edition .<span type="note_anchor">[ 387 ]</span>“ Columbia . ” — Ed . 1790 .<span type="note_anchor">[ 388 ]</span>“ Shivering with Hobaw winds . ” — Ib .<span type="note_anchor">[ 389 ]</span>“ The State house . ” — Ib .<span type="note_anchor">[ 390 ]</span>“ Charleston . ” — Ib . THE DISTREST THEATRE [ A ][ 391 ] [ A ] Harmony Hall , at Charleston , now demolished .— Freneau 's note . Health to the Muse !— and fill the glass , Heaven grant her soon some better place , Than earthen floor and fabric mean , Where disappointment shades the scene : There as I came , by rumour led , I sighed and almost wished her dead ; Her visage stained with many a tear , No Hallam and no Henry here ! But what could all their art attain ?— When pointed laws the stage restrain The prudent Muse obedience pays To sleepy squires , that damn all plays . Like thieves they hang beyond the town , They shove her off — to please the gown ;— Though Rome and Athens owned it true , The stage might mend our morals too . See , Mopsus all the evening sits O'er bottled beer , that drowns his wits ; Were Plays allowed , he might at least Blush — and no longer act the beast . See , Marcia , now from guardian free , Retailing scandal with her tea ;— Might she not come , nor danger fear From Hamlet 's sigh , or Juliet 's tear . The world but acts the player 's part [ B ] — ( So says the motto of their art ) — That world in vice great lengths is gone That fears to see its picture drawn . [ B ] Totus Mundus agit Histrionem .— Freneau 's note . Mere vulgar actors cannot please ; The streets supply enough of these ; And what can wit or beauty gain When sleepy dullness joins their train ? A State betrays a homely taste , By which the stage is thus disgraced , Where , drest in all the flowers of speech , Dame virtue might her precepts teach . Let but a dancing bear arrive , A pig , that counts you four , or five — And Cato , with his moral strain May strive to mend the world in vain .<span type="note_anchor">[ 391 ]</span>Published in the National Gazette , Nov. 21 , 1791 , with the following explanation : “ The amusements of the Theatre were some time since prohibited within the limits of the City of Charleston by an act of the Legislature of the State of South Carolina . In obedience to this act all subsequent dramatic exhibitions were removed to an obscure building in the City of liberties called Harmony Hall . The following stanzas owe their origin to the above edict . ” Text from the 1809 edition . TO MEMMIUS<span type="note_anchor">[ 392 ]</span>Whoe'er at Court would hope to cut a dash , He must go loaded with some useful trash , Something , sage Dullness , to prolong your reign ; All fancy — stuff — all ornament is vain ! Happy the man who plans , by force of steam To drive his boat twelve knots against the stream ; Still happier he , who , born to build a bridge , Schemes mighty matters on some river 's edge :— Such to the world the noblest light impart , The first in genius , and the first in art ! Hence , then , ye bards , from our wise court refrain ; Wiseacres have forestall 'd the present reign : “ No empty scribblings we endure at court ” ( Cries Publius , poring o'er a dull Report ;) “ Nothing but useful projects we require , ( Cries a new-fangled , self-important ‘ squire ) “ Even Churchman , with his chart , will just but do , “ Who to the pole will now all art pursue : “ For foreign courts have fail 'd our men of song , “ And trust me , bards , the Muses went along ; “ Since that bright morn they stept on board their brig , “ No Muses here — no Muses are with pig ; “ Nor ‘ till their barque shall heave in sight , once more , “ Shall one true Muse grow pregnant on this shore ! ” Now , had not wayward Fortune fix 'd me fast , Firm to a point , that never shall be pass 'd ; Did I the smiles of Fortune still pursue , And , Memmius , wish to rise in fame , like you , Were this my scheme , I 'd quit at once the sail , And haste to court with compasses and scale , Quit all the hopes the finer arts bestow , The flowers of fancy , and — no fruits that grow ; Indulge that powerful something in the scull That makes us wealthy while it keeps us dull , To the best place ensures a certain claim , The road to fortune , and the road to fame .<span type="note_anchor">[ 392 ]</span>This poem is unique , as far as I can discover , in the 1795 edition . The reference to steamboats alludes to Fitch , who at that time was experimenting with steam navigation . In 1790 he completed his fourth boat , which during the summer made regular trips from Philadelphia to Burlington , at the rate of eight miles per hour . END OF VOLUME II</p>
