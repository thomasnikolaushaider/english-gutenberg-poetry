    <head>BY MICHING MALLECHO , ESQ .</head>
     <l n="1">Is it a party in a parlour ,</l>
     <l n="2">Crammed just as they on earth were crammed ,</l>
     <l n="3">Some sipping punch — some sipping tea ;</l>
     <l n="4">But , as you by their faces see ,</l>
     <l n="5">All silent , and all — damned !</l>
     <l n="6">“ Peter Bell ” , by W. WORDSWORTH .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>OPHELIA .— What means this , my lord ? HAMLET .— Marry , this is Miching Mallecho ; it means mischief . SHAKESPEARE .</p>
   <p>DEDICATION .</p>
   <p>TO THOMAS BROWN , ESQ ., THE YOUNGER , H. F .</p>
   <p>DEAR TOM — Allow me to request you to introduce Mr. Peter Bell to the respectable family of the Fudges . Although he may fall short of those very considerable personages in the more active properties which characterize the Rat and the Apostate , I suspect that even you , their historian , will confess that he surpasses them in the more peculiarly legitimate qualification of intolerable dulness .</p>
   <p>You know Mr . Examiner Hunt ; well — it was he who presented me to two of the Mr. Bells . My intimacy with the younger Mr. Bell naturally sprung from this introduction to his brothers . And in presenting him to you , I have the satisfaction of being able to assure you that he is considerably the dullest of the three .</p>
   <p>There is this particular advantage in an acquaintance with any one of the Peter Bells , that if you know one Peter Bell , you know three Peter Bells ; they are not one , but three ; not three , but one . An awful mystery , which , after having caused torrents of blood , and having been hymned by groans enough to deafen the music of the spheres , is at length illustrated to the satisfaction of all parties in the theological world , by the nature of Mr. Peter Bell .</p>
   <p>Peter is a polyhedric Peter , or a Peter with many sides . He changes colours like a chameleon , and his coat like a snake . He is a Proteus of a Peter . He was at first sublime , pathetic , impressive , profound ; then dull ; then prosy and dull ; and now dull — oh so very dull ! it is an ultra-legitimate dulness .</p>
   <p>You will perceive that it is not necessary to consider Hell and the Devil as supernatural machinery . The whole scene of my epic is in ‘ this world which is ’ — so Peter informed us before his conversion to “ White Obi ” —</p>
   <p>‘ The world of all of us , AND WHERE WE FIND OUR HAPPINESS , OR NOT AT ALL . ’</p>
   <p>Let me observe that I have spent six or seven days in composing this sublime piece ; the orb of my moonlike genius has made the fourth part of its revolution round the dull earth which you inhabit , driving you mad , while it has retained its calmness and its splendour , and I have been fitting this its last phase ‘ to occupy a permanent station in the literature of my country . ’</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Your works , indeed , dear Tom , sell better ; but mine are far superior .</l>
     <l n="2">The public is no judge ; posterity sets all to rights .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Allow me to observe that so much has been written of Peter Bell , that the present history can be considered only , like the Iliad , as a continuation of that series of cyclic poems , which have already been candidates for bestowing immortality upon , at the same time that they receive it from , his character and adventures . In this point of view I have violated no rule of syntax in beginning my composition with a conjunction ; the full stop which closes the poem continued by me being , like the full stops at the end of the Iliad and Odyssey , a full stop of a very qualified import .</p>
   <p>Hoping that the immortality which you have given to the Fudges , you will receive from them ; and in the firm expectation , that when London shall be an habitation of bitterns ; when St. Paul 's and Westminster Abbey shall stand , shapeless and nameless ruins , in the midst of an unpeopled marsh ; when the piers of Waterloo Bridge shall become the nuclei of islets of reeds and osiers , and cast the jagged shadows of their broken arches on the solitary stream , some transatlantic commentator will be weighing in the scales of some new and now unimagined system of criticism , the respective merits of the Bells and the Fudges , and their historians . I remain , dear Tom , yours sincerely ,</p>

    <head>PROLOGUE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Peter Bells , one , two and three ,</l>
     <l n="2">O'er the wide world wandering be .—</l>
     <l n="3">First , the antenatal Peter ,</l>
     <l n="4">Wrapped in weeds of the same metre ,</l>
     <l n="5">The so-long-predestined raiment 5</l>
     <l n="6">Clothed in which to walk his way meant</l>
     <l n="7">The second Peter ; whose ambition</l>
     <l n="8">Is to link the proposition ,</l>
     <l n="9">As the mean of two extremes —</l>
     <l n="10">( This was learned from Aldric 's themes ) 10</l>
     <l n="11">Shielding from the guilt of schism</l>
     <l n="12">The orthodoxal syllogism ;</l>
     <l n="13">The First Peter — he who was</l>
     <l n="14">Like the shadow in the glass</l>
     <l n="15">Of the second , yet unripe , 15</l>
     <l n="16">His substantial antitype .—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="17">Then came Peter Bell the Second ,</l>
     <l n="18">Who henceforward must be reckoned</l>
     <l n="19">The body of a double soul ,</l>
     <l n="20">And that portion of the whole 20</l>
     <l n="21">Without which the rest would seem</l>
     <l n="22">Ends of a disjointed dream .—</l>
     <l n="23">And the Third is he who has</l>
     <l n="24">O'er the grave been forced to pass</l>
     <l n="25">To the other side , which is ,— 25</l>
     <l n="26">Go and try else ,— just like this .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="27">Peter Bell the First was Peter</l>
     <l n="28">Smugger , milder , softer , neater ,</l>
     <l n="29">Like the soul before it is</l>
     <l n="30">Born from THAT world into THIS . 30</l>
     <l n="31">The next Peter Bell was he ,</l>
     <l n="32">Predevote , like you and me ,</l>
     <l n="33">To good or evil as may come ;</l>
     <l n="34">His was the severer doom ,—</l>
     <l n="35">For he was an evil Cotter , 35</l>
     <l n="36">And a polygamic Potter .</l>
     <l n="37">And the last is Peter Bell ,</l>
     <l n="38">Damned since our first parents fell ,</l>
     <l n="39">Damned eternally to Hell —</l>
     <l n="40">Surely he deserves it well ! 40</l>

    <head>DEATH .</head>

     <l n="1">1 .</l>
     <l n="2">And Peter Bell , when he had been</l>
     <l n="3">With fresh-imported Hell-fire warmed ,</l>
     <l n="4">Grew serious — from his dress and mien</l>
     <l n="5">‘ Twas very plainly to be seen</l>
     <l n="6">Peter was quite reformed . 5</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">2 .</l>
     <l n="8">His eyes turned up , his mouth turned down ;</l>
     <l n="9">His accent caught a nasal twang ;</l>
     <l n="10">He oiled his hair ; there might be heard</l>
     <l n="11">The grace of God in every word</l>
     <l n="12">Which Peter said or sang . 10</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">3 .</l>
     <l n="14">But Peter now grew old , and had</l>
     <l n="15">An ill no doctor could unravel :</l>
     <l n="16">His torments almost drove him mad ;—</l>
     <l n="17">Some said it was a fever bad —</l>
     <l n="18">Some swore it was the gravel . 15</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">4 .</l>
     <l n="20">His holy friends then came about ,</l>
     <l n="21">And with long preaching and persuasion</l>
     <l n="22">Convinced the patient that , without</l>
     <l n="23">The smallest shadow of a doubt ,</l>
     <l n="24">He was predestined to damnation . 20</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">5 .</l>
     <l n="26">They said — ‘ Thy name is Peter Bell ;</l>
     <l n="27">Thy skin is of a brimstone hue ;</l>
     <l n="28">Alive or dead — ay , sick or well —</l>
     <l n="29">The one God made to rhyme with hell ;</l>
     <l n="30">The other , I think , rhymes with you . 25</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="31">6 .</l>
     <l n="32">Then Peter set up such a yell !—</l>
     <l n="33">The nurse , who with some water gruel</l>
     <l n="34">Was climbing up the stairs , as well</l>
     <l n="35">As her old legs could climb them — fell ,</l>
     <l n="36">And broke them both — the fall was cruel . 30</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="37">7 .</l>
     <l n="38">The Parson from the casement lept</l>
     <l n="39">Into the lake of Windermere —</l>
     <l n="40">And many an eel — though no adept</l>
     <l n="41">In God 's right reason for it — kept</l>
     <l n="42">Gnawing his kidneys half a year . 35</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="43">8 .</l>
     <l n="44">And all the rest rushed through the door</l>
     <l n="45">And tumbled over one another ,</l>
     <l n="46">And broke their skulls .— Upon the floor</l>
     <l n="47">Meanwhile sat Peter Bell , and swore ,</l>
     <l n="48">And cursed his father and his mother ; 40</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="49">9 .</l>
     <l n="50">And raved of God , and sin , and death ,</l>
     <l n="51">Blaspheming like an infidel ;</l>
     <l n="52">And said , that with his clenched teeth</l>
     <l n="53">He 'd seize the earth from underneath ,</l>
     <l n="54">And drag it with him down to hell . 45</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="55">10 .</l>
     <l n="56">As he was speaking came a spasm ,</l>
     <l n="57">And wrenched his gnashing teeth asunder ;</l>
     <l n="58">Like one who sees a strange phantasm</l>
     <l n="59">He lay ,— there was a silent chasm</l>
     <l n="60">Between his upper jaw and under . 50</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="61">11 .</l>
     <l n="62">And yellow death lay on his face ;</l>
     <l n="63">And a fixed smile that was not human</l>
     <l n="64">Told , as I understand the case ,</l>
     <l n="65">That he was gone to the wrong place :—</l>
     <l n="66">I heard all this from the old woman . 55</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="67">12 .</l>
     <l n="68">Then there came down from Langdale Pike</l>
     <l n="69">A cloud , with lightning , wind and hail ;</l>
     <l n="70">It swept over the mountains like</l>
     <l n="71">An ocean ,— and I heard it strike</l>
     <l n="72">The woods and crags of Grasmere vale . 60</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="73">13 .</l>
     <l n="74">And I saw the black storm come</l>
     <l n="75">Nearer , minute after minute ;</l>
     <l n="76">Its thunder made the cataracts dumb ;</l>
     <l n="77">With hiss , and clash , and hollow hum ,</l>
     <l n="78">It neared as if the Devil was in it . 65</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="79">14 .</l>
     <l n="80">The Devil WAS in it :— he had bought</l>
     <l n="81">Peter for half-a-crown ; and when</l>
     <l n="82">The storm which bore him vanished , nought</l>
     <l n="83">That in the house that storm had caught</l>
     <l n="84">Was ever seen again . 70</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="85">15 .</l>
     <l n="86">The gaping neighbours came next day —</l>
     <l n="87">They found all vanished from the shore :</l>
     <l n="88">The Bible , whence he used to pray ,</l>
     <l n="89">Half scorched under a hen-coop lay ;</l>
     <l n="90">Smashed glass — and nothing more ! 75</l>
