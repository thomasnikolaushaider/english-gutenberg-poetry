     <l n="1">Genius of the Forest Shades !</l>
     <l n="2">Lend thy pow'r , and lend thine ear !</l>
     <l n="3">A Stranger trod thy lonely glades ,</l>
     <l n="4">Amidst thy dark and bounding Deer ;</l>
     <l n="5">Inquiring Childhood claims the verse ,</l>
     <l n="6">O let them not inquire in vain ;</l>
     <l n="7">Be with me while I thus rehearse</l>
     <l n="8">The glories of thy Sylvan Reign .</l>

     <l n="9">Thy Dells by wint'ry currents worn ,</l>
     <l n="10">Secluded haunts , how dear to me !</l>
     <l n="11">From all but Nature 's converse borne ,</l>
     <l n="12">No ear to hear , no eye to see .</l>
     <l n="13">Their honour 'd leaves the green Oaks rear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="14">And crown 'd the upland 's graceful swell ;</l>
     <l n="15">While answering through the vale was heard</l>
     <l n="16">Each distant Heifer 's tinkling bell .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">Hail , Greenwood shades , that stretching far ,</l>
     <l n="18">Defy e'en Summer 's noontide pow'r ,</l>
     <l n="19">When August in his burning Car</l>
     <l n="20">Withholds the Cloud , withholds the Show'r .</l>
     <l n="21">The deep-ton 'd Low from either Hill ,</l>
     <l n="22">Down hazel aisles and arches green ,</l>
     <l n="23">( The Herd 's rude tracks from rill to rill )</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">From my charm 'd heart the numbers sprung ,</l>
     <l n="26">Though Birds had ceas 'd the choral lay :</l>
     <l n="27">I pour 'd wild raptures from my tongue ,</l>
     <l n="28">And gave delicious tears their way .</l>
     <l n="29">Then , darker shadows seeking still ,</l>
     <l n="30">Where human foot had seldom stray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="31">I read aloud to every Hill</l>
     <l n="32">Sweet Emma 's Love , ‘ the Nut-brown Maid . ’</l>

     <l n="33">Shaking his matted mane on high</l>
     <l n="34">The gazing Colt would raise his head ;</l>
     <l n="35">Or , tim'rous Doe would rushing fly ,</l>
     <l n="36">And leave to me her grassy bed :</l>
     <l n="37">Where , as the azure sky appear 'd</l>
     <l n="38">Through Bow'rs of every varying form ,</l>
     <l n="39">Midst the deep gloom methought I heard</l>
     <l n="40">The daring progress of the storm .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="41">How would each sweeping pond'rous bough</l>
     <l n="42">Resist , when straight the Whirlwind cleaves ,</l>
     <l n="43">Dashing in strength'ning eddies through</l>
     <l n="44">A roaring wilderness of leaves !</l>
     <l n="45">How would the prone descending show'r</l>
     <l n="46">From the green Canopy rebound !</l>
     <l n="47">How would the lowland torrents pour !</l>
     <l n="48">How deep the pealing thunder sound !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="49">But Peace was there : no lightnings blaz 'd :—</l>

     <l n="53">O tender minds ! in life 's gay morn</l>
     <l n="54">Some clouds must dim your coming day ;</l>
     <l n="55">Yet , bootless pride and falsehood scorn ,</l>

     <l n="60">My seat was destin 'd to the Main :</l>

     <l n="65">Perhaps they 'll many a conflict brave ,</l>

     <l n="68">Bring home the flag of victory .</l>
     <l n="69">Go , then , proud Oaks ; we meet no more !</l>
     <l n="70">Go , grace the scenes to me denied ,</l>
     <l n="71">The white Cliffs round my native shore ,</l>

     <l n="1">Now fare-thee-well , England ; no further I 'll roam ;</l>
     <l n="2">But follow my shadow that points the way home ;</l>
     <l n="3">Your gay southern Shores shall not tempt me to stay ;</l>
     <l n="4">For my Maggy 's at Home , and my Children at play !</l>
     <l n="5">Tis this makes my Bonnet set light on my brow ,</l>
     <l n="6">Gives my sinews their strength and my bosom its glow .</l>

     <l n="7">Farewell , Mountaineers ! my companions , adieu ;</l>
     <l n="8">Soon , many long miles when I 'm severed from you ,</l>
     <l n="9">I shall miss your white Horns on the brink of the Bourne ,</l>
     <l n="10">And o'er the rough Heaths , where you 'll never return :</l>
     <l n="11">But in brave English pastures you cannot complain ,</l>
     <l n="12">While your Drover speeds back to his Maggy again .</l>

     <l n="13">O Tweed ! gentle Tweed , as I pass your green vales ,</l>
     <l n="14">More than life , more than Love , my tir 'd Spirit inhales ;</l>
     <l n="15">There Scotland , my darling , lies full in my view ,</l>
     <l n="16">With her bare-footed Lasses and Mountains so blue :</l>
     <l n="17">To the Mountains away ; my heart bounds like the Hind ;</l>
     <l n="18">For home is so sweet , and my Maggy so kind .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">As day after day I still follow my course ,</l>
     <l n="20">And in fancy trace back every Stream to its source ,</l>
     <l n="21">Hope cheers me up hills , where the road lies before</l>
     <l n="22">O'er hills just as high , and o'er tracks of wild Moor ;</l>
     <l n="23">The keen polar Star nightly rising to view ;</l>
     <l n="24">But Maggy 's my Star , just as steady and true .</l>

     <l n="27">For the glory of Scotland reigns warm in my breast ,</l>
     <l n="28">And fortitude grows both from toil and from rest ;</l>
     <l n="29">May your deeds and your worth be for ever in view ,</l>
     <l n="30">And may Maggy bear sons not unworthy of you .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="31">Love , why do you urge me , so weary and poor ?</l>
     <l n="32">I cannot step faster , I cannot do more ;</l>
     <l n="33">I 've pass 'd silver Tweed ; e'en the Tay flows behind :</l>
     <l n="34">Yet fatigue I 'll disdain ;— my reward I shall find :</l>
     <l n="35">Thou , sweet smile of innocence , thou art my prize ;</l>
     <l n="36">And the joy that will sparkle in Maggy 's blue eyes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="37">She 'll watch to the southward ;— perhaps she will sigh ,</l>
     <l n="38">That the way is so long , and the Mountains so high ;</l>
     <l n="39">Perhaps some huge Rock in the dusk she may see ,</l>
     <l n="40">And will say in her fondness , ‘ That surely is he ! ’</l>
     <l n="41">Good Wife , you 're deceiv 'd ; I 'm still far from my home ;</l>
     <l n="42">Go , sleep , my dear Maggy ,— to-morrow I 'll come .</l>

   <p>Both the young Ladies had addressed to me a few complimentary lines , ( and I am sorry that those of the elder sister were never in my possession ;) in return for which I sent the above . It was received on the day on which the younger completed her ninth year . Surely it cannot be ascribed to vanity , if , in gratitude to a most amiable family , I here preserve verbatim an effort of a child nine years old . I hare the more pleasure in doing it , because I know them to be her own . R. B .</p>

     <l n="21">The fresh breeze bears its sweets along ;</l>
     <l n="22">The Lark but chides us while we stay :</l>
     <l n="23">Soon shall the Vale repeat my song ;</l>

     <l n="4">The morning breaks ; again rejoice ;</l>

     <l n="1">Dear Boy , throw that Icicle down ,</l>
     <l n="2">And sweep this deep Snow from the door :</l>
     <l n="3">Old Winter comes on with a frown ;</l>
     <l n="4">A terrible frown for the poor .</l>
     <l n="5">In a Season so rude and forlorn</l>
     <l n="6">How can age , how can infancy bear</l>
     <l n="7">The silent neglect and the scorn</l>
     <l n="8">Of those who have plenty to spare ?</l>

     <l n="13">While my Wife and I bask o'er the fire ,</l>

     <l n="22">And Hail down the chimney rebound ,</l>
