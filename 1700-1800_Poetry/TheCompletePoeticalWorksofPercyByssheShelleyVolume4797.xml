    <head>PREFACE BY MRS. SHELLEY</head>
    <p n="1">TO FIRST COLLECTED EDITION , 1839 .</p>
    <p n="2">Obstacles have long existed to my presenting the public with a perfect edition of Shelley 's Poems . These being at last happily removed , I hasten to fulfil an important duty ,— that of giving the productions of a sublime genius to the world , with all the correctness possible , and of , at the same time , detailing the history of those productions , as they sprang , living and warm , from his heart and brain . I abstain from any remark on the occurrences of his private life , except inasmuch as the passions which they engendered inspired his poetry . This is not the time to relate the truth ; and I should reject any colouring of the truth . No account of these events has ever been given at all approaching reality in their details , either as regards himself or others ; nor shall I further allude to them than to remark that the errors of action committed by a man as noble and generous as Shelley , may , as far as he only is concerned , be fearlessly avowed by those who loved him , in the firm conviction that , were they judged impartially , his character would stand in fairer and brighter light than that of any contemporary . Whatever faults he had ought to find extenuation among his fellows , since they prove him to be human ; without them , the exalted nature of his soul would have raised him into something divine .</p>
    <p n="3">The qualities that struck any one newly introduced to Shelley were ,— First , a gentle and cordial goodness that animated his intercourse with warm affection and helpful sympathy . The other , the eagerness and ardour with which he was attached to the cause of human happiness and improvement ; and the fervent eloquence with which he discussed such subjects . His conversation was marked by its happy abundance , and the beautiful language in which he clothed his poetic ideas and philosophical notions . To defecate life of its misery and its evil was the ruling passion of his soul ; he dedicated to it every power of his mind , every pulsation of his heart . He looked on political freedom as the direct agent to effect the happiness of mankind ; and thus any new-sprung hope of liberty inspired a joy and an exultation more intense and wild than he could have felt for any personal advantage . Those who have never experienced the workings of passion on general and unselfish subjects cannot understand this ; and it must be difficult of comprehension to the younger generation rising around , since they cannot remember the scorn and hatred with which the partisans of reform were regarded some few years ago , nor the persecutions to which they were exposed . He had been from youth the victim of the state of feeling inspired by the reaction of the French Revolution ; and believing firmly in the justice and excellence of his views , it cannot be wondered that a nature as sensitive , as impetuous , and as generous as his , should put its whole force into the attempt to alleviate for others the evils of those systems from which he had himself suffered . Many advantages attended his birth ; he spurned them all when balanced with what he considered his duties . He was generous to imprudence , devoted to heroism .</p>
    <p n="4">These characteristics breathe throughout his poetry . The struggle for human weal ; the resolution firm to martyrdom ; the impetuous pursuit , the glad triumph in good ; the determination not to despair ;— such were the features that marked those of his works which he regarded with most complacency , as sustained by a lofty subject and useful aim .</p>
    <p n="5">In addition to these , his poems may be divided into two classes ,— the purely imaginative , and those which sprang from the emotions of his heart . Among the former may be classed the “ Witch of Atlas ” , “ Adonais ” , and his latest composition , left imperfect , the “ Triumph of Life ” . In the first of these particularly he gave the reins to his fancy , and luxuriated in every idea as it rose ; in all there is that sense of mystery which formed an essential portion of his perception of life — a clinging to the subtler inner spirit , rather than to the outward form — a curious and metaphysical anatomy of human passion and perception .</p>
    <p n="6">The second class is , of course , the more popular , as appealing at once to emotions common to us all ; some of these rest on the passion of love ; others on grief and despondency ; others on the sentiments inspired by natural objects . Shelley 's conception of love was exalted , absorbing , allied to all that is purest and noblest in our nature , and warmed by earnest passion ; such it appears when he gave it a voice in verse . Yet he was usually averse to expressing these feelings , except when highly idealized ; and many of his more beautiful effusions he had cast aside unfinished , and they were never seen by me till after I had lost him . Others , as for instance “ Rosalind and Helen ” and “ Lines written among the Euganean Hills ” , I found among his papers by chance ; and with some difficulty urged him to complete them . There are others , such as the “ Ode to the Skylark and The Cloud ” , which , in the opinion of many critics , bear a purer poetical stamp than any other of his productions . They were written as his mind prompted : listening to the carolling of the bird , aloft in the azure sky of Italy ; or marking the cloud as it sped across the heavens , while he floated in his boat on the Thames .</p>
    <p n="7">No poet was ever warmed by a more genuine and unforced inspiration . His extreme sensibility gave the intensity of passion to his intellectual pursuits ; and rendered his mind keenly alive to every perception of outward objects , as well as to his internal sensations . Such a gift is , among the sad vicissitudes of human life , the disappointments we meet , and the galling sense of our own mistakes and errors , fraught with pain ; to escape from such , he delivered up his soul to poetry , and felt happy when he sheltered himself , from the influence of human sympathies , in the wildest regions of fancy . His imagination has been termed too brilliant , his thoughts too subtle . He loved to idealize reality ; and this is a taste shared by few . We are willing to have our passing whims exalted into passions , for this gratifies our vanity ; but few of us understand or sympathize with the endeavour to ally the love of abstract beauty , and adoration of abstract good , the to agathon kai to kalon of the Socratic philosophers , with our sympathies with our kind . In this , Shelley resembled Plato ; both taking more delight in the abstract and the ideal than in the special and tangible . This did not result from imitation ; for it was not till Shelley resided in Italy that he made Plato his study . He then translated his “ Symposium ” and his “ Ion ” ; and the English language boasts of no more brilliant composition than Plato 's Praise of Love translated by Shelley . To return to his own poetry . The luxury of imagination , which sought nothing beyond itself ( as a child burdens itself with spring flowers , thinking of no use beyond the enjoyment of gathering them ) , often showed itself in his verses : they will be only appreciated by minds which have resemblance to his own ; and the mystic subtlety of many of his thoughts will share the same fate . The metaphysical strain that characterizes much of what he has written was , indeed , the portion of his works to which , apart from those whose scope was to awaken mankind to aspirations for what he considered the true and good , he was himself particularly attached . There is much , however , that speaks to the many . When he would consent to dismiss these huntings after the obscure ( which , entwined with his nature as they were , he did with difficulty ) , no poet ever expressed in sweeter , more heart-reaching , or more passionate verse , the gentler or more forcible emotions of the soul .</p>
    <p n="8">A wise friend once wrote to Shelley : ‘ You are still very young , and in certain essential respects you do not yet sufficiently perceive that you are so . ’ It is seldom that the young know what youth is , till they have got beyond its period ; and time was not given him to attain this knowledge . It must be remembered that there is the stamp of such inexperience on all he wrote ; he had not completed his nine-and-twentieth year when he died . The calm of middle life did not add the seal of the virtues which adorn maturity to those generated by the vehement spirit of youth . Through life also he was a martyr to ill-health , and constant pain wound up his nerves to a pitch of susceptibility that rendered his views of life different from those of a man in the enjoyment of healthy sensations . Perfectly gentle and forbearing in manner , he suffered a good deal of internal irritability , or rather excitement , and his fortitude to bear was almost always on the stretch ; and thus , during a short life , he had gone through more experience of sensation than many whose existence is protracted . ‘ If I die to-morrow , ’ he said , on the eve of his unanticipated death , ‘ I have lived to be older than my father . ’ The weight of thought and feeling burdened him heavily ; you read his sufferings in his attenuated frame , while you perceived the mastery he held over them in his animated countenance and brilliant eyes .</p>
    <p n="9">He died , and the world showed no outward sign . But his influence over mankind , though slow in growth , is fast augmenting ; and , in the ameliorations that have taken place in the political state of his country , we may trace in part the operation of his arduous struggles . His spirit gathers peace in its new state from the sense that , though late , his exertions were not made in vain , and in the progress of the liberty he so fondly loved .</p>
    <p n="10">He died , and his place , among those who knew him intimately , has never been filled up . He walked beside them like a spirit of good to comfort and benefit — to enlighten the darkness of life with irradiations of genius , to cheer it with his sympathy and love . Any one , once attached to Shelley , must feel all other affections , however true and fond , as wasted on barren soil in comparison . It is our best consolation to know that such a pure-minded and exalted being was once among us , and now exists where we hope one day to join him ;— although the intolerant , in their blindness , poured down anathemas , the Spirit of Good , who can judge the heart , never rejected him .</p>
    <p n="11">In the notes appended to the poems I have endeavoured to narrate the origin and history of each . The loss of nearly all letters and papers which refer to his early life renders the execution more imperfect than it would otherwise have been . I have , however , the liveliest recollection of all that was done and said during the period of my knowing him . Every impression is as clear as if stamped yesterday , and I have no apprehension of any mistake in my statements as far as they go . In other respects I am indeed incompetent : but I feel the importance of the task , and regard it as my most sacred duty . I endeavour to fulfil it in a manner he would himself approve ; and hope , in this publication , to lay the first stone of a monument due to Shelley 's genius , his sufferings , and his virtues :—</p>

    <docImprint>POSTSCRIPT IN SECOND EDITION OF<date>1839</date>. In revising this new edition , and carefully consulting Shelley 's scattered and confused papers , I found a few fragments which had hitherto escaped me , and was enabled to complete a few poems hitherto left unfinished . What at one time escapes the searching eye , dimmed by its own earnestness , becomes clear at a future period . By the aid of a friend , I also present some poems complete and correct which hitherto have been defaced by various mistakes and omissions . It was suggested that the poem “ To the Queen of my Heart ” was falsely attributed to Shelley . I certainly find no trace of it among his papers ; and , as those of his intimate friends whom I have consulted never heard of it , I omit it . Two poems are added of some length , “ Swellfoot the Tyrant ” and “ Peter Bell the Third ” . I have mentioned the circumstances under which they were written in the notes ; and need only add that they are conceived in a very different spirit from Shelley 's usual compositions . They are specimens of the burlesque and fanciful ; but , although they adopt a familiar style and homely imagery , there shine through the radiance of the poet 's imagination the earnest views and opinions of the politician and the moralist . At my request the publisher has restored the omitted passages of “ Queen Mab ” . I now present this edition as a complete collection of my husband 's poetical works , and I do not foresee that I can hereafter add to or take away a word or line .

    <head>PREFACE BY MRS. SHELLEY .</head>
    <p n="13">TO THE VOLUME OF POSTHUMOUS POEMS PUBLISHED IN 1824 .</p>
    <p n="14">In nobil sangue vita umile e queta , Ed in alto intelletto un puro core Frutto senile in sul giovenil fibre , E in aspetto pensoso anima lieta .— PETRARCA .</p>
    <p n="15">It had been my wish , on presenting the public with the Posthumous Poems of Mr. Shelley , to have accompanied them by a biographical notice ; as it appeared to me that at this moment a narration of the events of my husband 's life would come more gracefully from other hands than mine , I applied to Mr. Leigh Hunt . The distinguished friendship that Mr. Shelley felt for him , and the enthusiastic affection with which Mr. Leigh Hunt clings to his friend 's memory , seemed to point him out as the person best calculated for such an undertaking . His absence from this country , which prevented our mutual explanation , has unfortunately rendered my scheme abortive . I do not doubt but that on some other occasion he will pay this tribute to his lost friend , and sincerely regret that the volume which I edit has not been honoured by its insertion .</p>
    <p n="16">The comparative solitude in which Mr. Shelley lived was the occasion that he was personally known to few ; and his fearless enthusiasm in the cause which he considered the most sacred upon earth , the improvement of the moral and physical state of mankind , was the chief reason why he , like other illustrious reformers , was pursued by hatred and calumny . No man was ever more devoted than he to the endeavour of making those around him happy ; no man ever possessed friends more unfeignedly attached to him . The ungrateful world did not feel his loss , and the gap it made seemed to close as quickly over his memory as the murderous sea above his living frame . Hereafter men will lament that his transcendent powers of intellect were extinguished before they had bestowed on them their choicest treasures . To his friends his loss is irremediable : the wise , the brave , the gentle , is gone for ever ! He is to them as a bright vision , whose radiant track , left behind in the memory , is worth all the realities that society can afford . Before the critics contradict me , let them appeal to any one who had ever known him . To see him was to love him : and his presence , like Ithuriel 's spear , was alone sufficient to disclose the falsehood of the tale which his enemies whispered in the ear of the ignorant world .</p>
    <p n="17">His life was spent in the contemplation of Nature , in arduous study , or in acts of kindness and affection . He was an elegant scholar and a profound metaphysician ; without possessing much scientific knowledge , he was unrivalled in the justness and extent of his observations on natural objects ; he knew every plant by its name , and was familiar with the history and habits of every production of the earth ; he could interpret without a fault each appearance in the sky ; and the varied phenomena of heaven and earth filled him with deep emotion . He made his study and reading-room of the shadowed copse , the stream , the lake , and the waterfall . Ill health and continual pain preyed upon his powers ; and the solitude in which we lived , particularly on our first arrival in Italy , although congenial to his feelings , must frequently have weighed upon his spirits ; those beautiful and affecting “ Lines written in Dejection near Naples ” were composed at such an interval ; but , when in health , his spirits were buoyant and youthful to an extraordinary degree .</p>
    <p n="18">Such was his love for Nature that every page of his poetry is associated , in the minds of his friends , with the loveliest scenes of the countries which he inhabited . In early life he visited the most beautiful parts of this country and Ireland . Afterwards the Alps of Switzerland became his inspirers . “ Prometheus Unbound ” was written among the deserted and flower-grown ruins of Rome ; and , when he made his home under the Pisan hills , their roofless recesses harboured him as he composed the “ Witch of Atlas ” , “ Adonais ” , and “ Hellas ” . In the wild but beautiful Bay of Spezzia , the winds and waves which he loved became his playmates . His days were chiefly spent on the water ; the management of his boat , its alterations and improvements , were his principal occupation . At night , when the unclouded moon shone on the calm sea , he often went alone in his little shallop to the rocky caves that bordered it , and , sitting beneath their shelter , wrote the “ Triumph of Life ” , the last of his productions . The beauty but strangeness of this lonely place , the refined pleasure which he felt in the companionship of a few selected friends , our entire sequestration from the rest of the world , all contributed to render this period of his life one of continued enjoyment . I am convinced that the two months we passed there were the happiest which he had ever known : his health even rapidly improved , and he was never better than when I last saw him , full of spirits and joy , embark for Leghorn , that he might there welcome Leigh Hunt to Italy . I was to have accompanied him ; but illness confined me to my room , and thus put the seal on my misfortune . His vessel bore out of sight with a favourable wind , and I remained awaiting his return by the breakers of that sea which was about to engulf him .</p>
    <p n="19">He spent a week at Pisa , employed in kind offices toward his friend , and enjoying with keen delight the renewal of their intercourse . He then embarked with Mr. Williams , the chosen and beloved sharer of his pleasures and of his fate , to return to us . We waited for them in vain ; the sea by its restless moaning seemed to desire to inform us of what we would not learn :— but a veil may well be drawn over such misery . The real anguish of those moments transcended all the fictions that the most glowing imagination ever portrayed ; our seclusion , the savage nature of the inhabitants of the surrounding villages , and our immediate vicinity to the troubled sea , combined to imbue with strange horror our days of uncertainty . The truth was at last known ,— a truth that made our loved and lovely Italy appear a tomb , its sky a pall . Every heart echoed the deep lament , and my only consolation was in the praise and earnest love that each voice bestowed and each countenance demonstrated for him we had lost ,— not , I fondly hope , for ever ; his unearthly and elevated nature is a pledge of the continuation of his being , although in an altered form . Rome received his ashes ; they are deposited beneath its weed-grown wall , and ‘ the world 's sole monument ’ is enriched by his remains .</p>
    <p n="20">I must add a few words concerning the contents of this volume . “ Julian and Maddalo ” , the “ Witch of Atlas ” , and most of the “ Translations ” , were written some years ago ; and , with the exception of the “ Cyclops ” , and the Scenes from the “ Magico Prodigioso ” , may be considered as having received the author 's ultimate corrections . The “ Triumph of Life ” was his last work , and was left in so unfinished a state that I arranged it in its present form with great difficulty . All his poems which were scattered in periodical works are collected in this volume , and I have added a reprint of “ Alastor , or the Spirit of Solitude ": the difficulty with which a copy can be obtained is the cause of its republication . Many of the Miscellaneous Poems , written on the spur of the occasion , and never retouched , I found among his manuscript books , and have carefully copied . I have subjoined , whenever I have been able , the date of their composition .</p>
    <p n="21">I do not know whether the critics will reprehend the insertion of some of the most imperfect among them ; but I frankly own that I have been more actuated by the fear lest any monument of his genius should escape me than the wish of presenting nothing but what was complete to the fastidious reader . I feel secure that the lovers of Shelley 's poetry ( who know how , more than any poet of the present day , every line and word he wrote is instinct with peculiar beauty ) will pardon and thank me : I consecrate this volume to them .</p>
    <p n="22">The size of this collection has prevented the insertion of any prose pieces . They will hereafter appear in a separate publication .</p>

   <p>PREFACE .</p>
   <p>The poem entitled “ Alastor ” may be considered as allegorical of one of the most interesting situations of the human mind . It represents a youth of uncorrupted feelings and adventurous genius led forth by an imagination inflamed and purified through familiarity with all that is excellent and majestic , to the contemplation of the universe . He drinks deep of the fountains of knowledge , and is still insatiate . The magnificence and beauty of the external world sinks profoundly into the frame of his conceptions , and affords to their modifications at variety not to be exhausted . so long as it is possible for his desires to point towards objects thus infinite and unmeasured , he is joyous , and tranquil , and self-possessed . But the period arrives when these objects cease to suffice . His mind is at length suddenly awakened and thirsts for intercourse with an intelligence similar to itself . He images to himself the Being whom he loves . Conversant with speculations of the sublimest and most perfect natures , the vision in which he embodies his own imaginations unites all of wonderful , or wise , or beautiful , which the poet , the philosopher , or the lover could depicture . The intellectual faculties , the imagination , the functions of sense , have their respective requisitions on the sympathy of corresponding powers in other human beings . The Poet is represented as uniting these requisitions , and attaching them to a single image . He seeks in vain for a prototype of his conception . Blasted by his disappointment , he descends to an untimely grave .</p>
   <p>The picture is not barren of instruction to actual men . The Poet 's self-centred seclusion was avenged by the furies of an irresistible passion pursuing him to speedy ruin . But that Power which strikes the luminaries of the world with sudden darkness and extinction , by awakening them to too exquisite a perception of its influences , dooms to a slow and poisonous decay those manner spirits that dare to abjure its dominion . Their destiny is more abject and inglorious as their delinquency is more contemptible and pernicious . They who , deluded by no generous error , instigated by no sacred thirst of doubtful knowledge , duped by no illustrious superstition , loving nothing on this earth , and cherishing no hopes beyond , yet keep aloof from sympathies with their kind , rejoicing neither in human joy nor mourning with human grief ; these , and such as they , have their apportioned curse . They languish , because none feel with them their common nature . They are morally dead . They are neither friends , nor lovers , nor fathers , nor citizens of the world , nor benefactors of their country . Among those who attempt to exist without human sympathy , the pure and tender-hearted perish through the intensity and passion of their search after its communities , when the vacancy of their spirit suddenly makes itself felt . All else , selfish , blind , and torpid , are those unforeseeing multitudes who constitute , together with their own , the lasting misery and loneliness of the world . Those who love not their fellow-beings live unfruitful lives , and prepare for their old age a miserable grave .</p>

     <l n="3">With aught of natural piety to feel</l>
     <l n="4">Your love , and recompense the boon with mine ;</l>
     <l n="5">If dewy morn , and odorous noon , and even , 5</l>
     <l n="6">With sunset and its gorgeous ministers ,</l>
     <l n="7">And solemn midnight 's tingling silentness ;</l>
     <l n="8">If autumn 's hollow sighs in the sere wood ,</l>
     <l n="9">And winter robing with pure snow and crowns</l>
     <l n="10">Of starry ice the grey grass and bare boughs ; 10</l>
     <l n="11">If spring 's voluptuous pantings when she breathes</l>
     <l n="12">Her first sweet kisses , have been dear to me ;</l>
     <l n="13">If no bright bird , insect , or gentle beast</l>
     <l n="14">I consciously have injured , but still loved</l>
     <l n="15">And cherished these my kindred ; then forgive 15</l>

     <l n="21">Thy shadow , and the darkness of thy steps ,</l>
     <l n="22">And my heart ever gazes on the depth</l>
     <l n="23">Of thy deep mysteries . I have made my bed</l>
     <l n="24">In charnels and on coffins , where black death</l>
     <l n="25">Keeps record of the trophies won from thee , 25</l>
     <l n="26">Hoping to still these obstinate questionings</l>
     <l n="27">Of thee and thine , by forcing some lone ghost ,</l>
     <l n="28">Thy messenger , to render up the tale</l>
     <l n="29">Of what we are . In lone and silent hours ,</l>
     <l n="30">When night makes a weird sound of its own stillness , 30</l>
     <l n="31">Like an inspired and desperate alchymist</l>
     <l n="32">Staking his very life on some dark hope ,</l>
     <l n="33">Have I mixed awful talk and asking looks</l>
     <l n="34">With my most innocent love , until strange tears ,</l>
     <l n="35">Uniting with those breathless kisses , made 35</l>
     <l n="36">Such magic as compels the charmed night</l>
     <l n="37">To render up thy charge :... and , though ne'er yet</l>
     <l n="38">Thou hast unveiled thy inmost sanctuary ,</l>
     <l n="39">Enough from incommunicable dream ,</l>
     <l n="40">And twilight phantasms , and deep noon-day thought , 40</l>
     <l n="41">Has shone within me , that serenely now</l>
     <l n="42">And moveless , as a long-forgotten lyre</l>
     <l n="43">Suspended in the solitary dome</l>
     <l n="44">Of some mysterious and deserted fane ,</l>
     <l n="45">I wait thy breath , Great Parent , that my strain 45</l>
     <l n="46">May modulate with murmurs of the air ,</l>
     <l n="47">And motions of the forests and the sea ,</l>
     <l n="48">And voice of living beings , and woven hymns</l>

     <l n="50">There was a Poet whose untimely tomb 50</l>
     <l n="51">No human hands with pious reverence reared ,</l>
     <l n="52">But the charmed eddies of autumnal winds</l>
     <l n="53">Built o'er his mouldering bones a pyramid</l>
     <l n="54">Of mouldering leaves in the waste wilderness :—</l>
     <l n="55">A lovely youth ,— no mourning maiden decked 55</l>
     <l n="56">With weeping flowers , or votive cypress wreath ,</l>
     <l n="57">The lone couch of his everlasting sleep :—</l>
     <l n="58">Gentle , and brave , and generous ,— no lorn bard</l>
     <l n="59">Breathed o'er his dark fate one melodious sigh :</l>
     <l n="60">He lived , he died , he sung in solitude . 60</l>
     <l n="61">Strangers have wept to hear his passionate notes ,</l>
     <l n="62">And virgins , as unknown he passed , have pined</l>
     <l n="63">And wasted for fond love of his wild eyes .</l>
     <l n="64">The fire of those soft orbs has ceased to burn ,</l>
     <l n="65">And Silence , too enamoured of that voice , 65</l>
     <l n="66">Locks its mute music in her rugged cell .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="67">By solemn vision , and bright silver dream</l>
     <l n="68">His infancy was nurtured . Every sight</l>
     <l n="69">And sound from the vast earth and ambient air ,</l>
     <l n="70">Sent to his heart its choicest impulses . 70</l>
     <l n="71">The fountains of divine philosophy</l>
     <l n="72">Fled not his thirsting lips , and all of great ,</l>
     <l n="73">Or good , or lovely , which the sacred past</l>
     <l n="74">In truth or fable consecrates , he felt</l>
     <l n="75">And knew . When early youth had passed , he left 75</l>
     <l n="76">His cold fireside and alienated home</l>
     <l n="77">To seek strange truths in undiscovered lands .</l>
     <l n="78">Many a wide waste and tangled wilderness</l>
     <l n="79">Has lured his fearless steps ; and he has bought</l>
     <l n="80">With his sweet voice and eyes , from savage men , 80</l>
     <l n="81">His rest and food . Nature 's most secret steps</l>
     <l n="82">He like her shadow has pursued , where'er</l>
     <l n="83">The red volcano overcanopies</l>
     <l n="84">Its fields of snow and pinnacles of ice</l>
     <l n="85">With burning smoke , or where bitumen lakes 85</l>
     <l n="86">On black bare pointed islets ever beat</l>
     <l n="87">With sluggish surge , or where the secret caves ,</l>
     <l n="88">Rugged and dark , winding among the springs</l>
     <l n="89">Of fire and poison , inaccessible</l>
     <l n="90">To avarice or pride , their starry domes 90</l>
     <l n="91">Of diamond and of gold expand above</l>
     <l n="92">Numberless and immeasurable halls ,</l>
     <l n="93">Frequent with crystal column , and clear shrines</l>
     <l n="94">Of pearl , and thrones radiant with chrysolite .</l>
     <l n="95">Nor had that scene of ampler majesty 95</l>
     <l n="96">Than gems or gold , the varying roof of heaven</l>
     <l n="97">And the green earth lost in his heart its claims</l>
     <l n="98">To love and wonder ; he would linger long</l>
     <l n="99">In lonesome vales , making the wild his home ,</l>
     <l n="100">Until the doves and squirrels would partake 100</l>
     <l n="101">From his innocuous hand his bloodless food ,</l>
     <l n="102">Lured by the gentle meaning of his looks ,</l>
     <l n="103">And the wild antelope , that starts whene'er</l>
     <l n="104">The dry leaf rustles in the brake , suspend</l>
     <l n="105">Her timid steps , to gaze upon a form</l>
     <l n="106">More graceful than her own . 105</l>
     <l n="107">His wandering step ,</l>
     <l n="108">Obedient to high thoughts , has visited</l>
     <l n="109">The awful ruins of the days of old :</l>
     <l n="110">Athens , and Tyre , and Balbec , and the waste</l>
     <l n="111">Where stood Jerusalem , the fallen towers 110</l>
     <l n="112">Of Babylon , the eternal pyramids ,</l>
     <l n="113">Memphis and Thebes , and whatsoe'er of strange ,</l>

     <l n="115">Or jasper tomb , or mutilated sphynx ,</l>
     <l n="116">Dark Aethiopia in her desert hills 115</l>
     <l n="117">Conceals . Among the ruined temples there ,</l>
     <l n="118">Stupendous columns , and wild images</l>
     <l n="119">Of more than man , where marble daemons watch</l>
     <l n="120">The Zodiac 's brazen mystery , and dead men</l>
     <l n="121">Hang their mute thoughts on the mute walls around , 120</l>
     <l n="122">He lingered , poring on memorials</l>
     <l n="123">Of the world 's youth : through the long burning day</l>
     <l n="124">Gazed on those speechless shapes ; nor , when the moon</l>
     <l n="125">Filled the mysterious halls with floating shades</l>
     <l n="126">Suspended he that task , but ever gazed 125</l>
     <l n="127">And gazed , till meaning on his vacant mind</l>
     <l n="128">Flashed like strong inspiration , and he saw</l>

     <l n="134">Enamoured , yet not daring for deep awe</l>
     <l n="135">To speak her love :— and watched his nightly sleep ,</l>

     <l n="141">The Poet , wandering on , through Arabie , 140</l>
     <l n="142">And Persia , and the wild Carmanian waste ,</l>
     <l n="143">And o'er the aerial mountains which pour down</l>
     <l n="144">Indus and Oxus from their icy caves ,</l>
     <l n="145">In joy and exultation held his way ;</l>
     <l n="146">Till in the vale of Cashmire , far within 145</l>
     <l n="147">Its loneliest dell , where odorous plants entwine</l>
     <l n="148">Beneath the hollow rocks a natural bower ,</l>
     <l n="149">Beside a sparkling rivulet he stretched</l>
     <l n="150">His languid limbs . A vision on his sleep</l>
     <l n="151">There came , a dream of hopes that never yet 150</l>
     <l n="152">Had flushed his cheek . He dreamed a veiled maid</l>
     <l n="153">Sate near him , talking in low solemn tones .</l>
     <l n="154">Her voice was like the voice of his own soul</l>
     <l n="155">Heard in the calm of thought ; its music long ,</l>
     <l n="156">Like woven sounds of streams and breezes , held 155</l>
     <l n="157">His inmost sense suspended in its web</l>
     <l n="158">Of many-coloured woof and shifting hues .</l>
     <l n="159">Knowledge and truth and virtue were her theme ,</l>
     <l n="160">And lofty hopes of divine liberty ,</l>
     <l n="161">Thoughts the most dear to him , and poesy , 160</l>
     <l n="162">Herself a poet . Soon the solemn mood</l>
     <l n="163">Of her pure mind kindled through all her frame</l>
     <l n="164">A permeating fire ; wild numbers then</l>
     <l n="165">She raised , with voice stifled in tremulous sobs</l>
     <l n="166">Subdued by its own pathos ; her fair hands 165</l>
     <l n="167">Were bare alone , sweeping from some strange harp</l>
     <l n="168">Strange symphony , and in their branching veins</l>
     <l n="169">The eloquent blood told an ineffable tale .</l>
     <l n="170">The beating of her heart was heard to fill</l>
     <l n="171">The pauses of her music , and her breath 170</l>
     <l n="172">Tumultuously accorded with those fits</l>
     <l n="173">Of intermitted song . Sudden she rose ,</l>
     <l n="174">As if her heart impatiently endured</l>
     <l n="175">Its bursting burthen : at the sound he turned ,</l>
     <l n="176">And saw by the warm light of their own life 175</l>
     <l n="177">Her glowing limbs beneath the sinuous veil</l>
     <l n="178">Of woven wind , her outspread arms now bare ,</l>
     <l n="179">Her dark locks floating in the breath of night ,</l>
     <l n="180">Her beamy bending eyes , her parted lips</l>
     <l n="181">Outstretched , and pale , and quivering eagerly . 180</l>
     <l n="182">His strong heart sunk and sickened with excess</l>
     <l n="183">Of love . He reared his shuddering limbs and quelled</l>
     <l n="184">His gasping breath , and spread his arms to meet</l>
     <l n="185">Her panting bosom :... she drew back a while ,</l>
     <l n="186">Then , yielding to the irresistible joy , 185</l>
     <l n="187">With frantic gesture and short breathless cry</l>
     <l n="188">Folded his frame in her dissolving arms .</l>
     <l n="189">Now blackness veiled his dizzy eyes , and night</l>
     <l n="190">Involved and swallowed up the vision ; sleep ,</l>
     <l n="191">Like a dark flood suspended in its course , 190</l>
     <l n="192">Rolled back its impulse on his vacant brain .</l>

     <l n="196">The distinct valley and the vacant woods , 195</l>
     <l n="197">Spread round him where he stood . Whither have fled</l>
     <l n="198">The hues of heaven that canopied his bower</l>
     <l n="199">Of yesternight ? The sounds that soothed his sleep ,</l>

     <l n="201">The joy , the exultation ? His wan eyes 200</l>

     <l n="205">A vision to the sleep of him who spurned</l>
     <l n="206">Her choicest gifts . He eagerly pursues 205</l>
     <l n="207">Beyond the realms of dream that fleeting shade ;</l>
     <l n="208">He overleaps the bounds . Alas ! Alas !</l>
     <l n="209">Were limbs , and breath , and being intertwined</l>
     <l n="210">Thus treacherously ? Lost , lost , for ever lost</l>
     <l n="211">In the wide pathless desert of dim sleep , 210</l>
     <l n="212">That beautiful shape ! Does the dark gate of death</l>
     <l n="213">Conduct to thy mysterious paradise ,</l>
     <l n="214">O Sleep ? Does the bright arch of rainbow clouds</l>
     <l n="215">And pendent mountains seen in the calm lake ,</l>
     <l n="216">Lead only to a black and watery depth , 215</l>
     <l n="217">While death 's blue vault , with loathliest vapours hung ,</l>
     <l n="218">Where every shade which the foul grave exhales</l>
     <l n="219">Hides its dead eye from the detested day ,</l>
     <l n="220">Conducts , O Sleep , to thy delightful realms ?</l>
     <l n="221">This doubt with sudden tide flowed on his heart ; 220</l>
     <l n="222">The insatiate hope which it awakened , stung</l>
     <l n="223">His brain even like despair .</l>
     <l n="224">While daylight held</l>
     <l n="225">The sky , the Poet kept mute conference</l>
     <l n="226">With his still soul . At night the passion came ,</l>
     <l n="227">Like the fierce fiend of a distempered dream , 225</l>
     <l n="228">And shook him from his rest , and led him forth</l>
     <l n="229">Into the darkness .— As an eagle , grasped</l>
     <l n="230">In folds of the green serpent , feels her breast</l>
     <l n="231">Burn with the poison , and precipitates</l>
     <l n="232">Through night and day , tempest , and calm , and cloud , 230</l>
     <l n="233">Frantic with dizzying anguish , her blind flight</l>
     <l n="234">O'er the wide aery wilderness : thus driven</l>
     <l n="235">By the bright shadow of that lovely dream ,</l>
     <l n="236">Beneath the cold glare of the desolate night ,</l>
     <l n="237">Through tangled swamps and deep precipitous dells , 235</l>
     <l n="238">Startling with careless step the moonlight snake ,</l>
     <l n="239">He fled . Red morning dawned upon his flight ,</l>
     <l n="240">Shedding the mockery of its vital hues</l>
     <l n="241">Upon his cheek of death . He wandered on</l>
     <l n="242">Till vast Aornos seen from Petra 's steep 240</l>
     <l n="243">Hung o'er the low horizon like a cloud ;</l>
     <l n="244">Through Balk , and where the desolated tombs</l>
     <l n="245">Of Parthian kings scatter to every wind</l>
     <l n="246">Their wasting dust , wildly he wandered on ,</l>
     <l n="247">Day after day a weary waste of hours , 245</l>
     <l n="248">Bearing within his life the brooding care</l>
     <l n="249">That ever fed on its decaying flame .</l>
     <l n="250">And now his limbs were lean ; his scattered hair ,</l>
     <l n="251">Sered by the autumn of strange suffering</l>
     <l n="252">Sung dirges in the wind ; his listless hand 250</l>
     <l n="253">Hung like dead bone within its withered skin ;</l>
     <l n="254">Life , and the lustre that consumed it , shone</l>
     <l n="255">As in a furnace burning secretly</l>
     <l n="256">From his dark eyes alone . The cottagers ,</l>
     <l n="257">Who ministered with human charity 255</l>
     <l n="258">His human wants , beheld with wondering awe</l>
     <l n="259">Their fleeting visitant . The mountaineer ,</l>
     <l n="260">Encountering on some dizzy precipice</l>
     <l n="261">That spectral form , deemed that the Spirit of wind</l>
     <l n="262">With lightning eyes , and eager breath , and feet 260</l>
     <l n="263">Disturbing not the drifted snow , had paused</l>
     <l n="264">In its career : the infant would conceal</l>

     <l n="275">He paused , a wide and melancholy waste</l>
     <l n="276">Of putrid marshes . A strong impulse urged</l>
     <l n="277">His steps to the sea-shore . A swan was there , 275</l>
     <l n="278">Beside a sluggish stream among the reeds .</l>
     <l n="279">It rose as he approached , and , with strong wings</l>
     <l n="280">Scaling the upward sky , bent its bright course</l>
     <l n="281">High over the immeasurable main .</l>
     <l n="282">His eyes pursued its flight :— ‘ Thou hast a home , 280</l>
     <l n="283">Beautiful bird ; thou voyagest to thine home ,</l>
     <l n="284">Where thy sweet mate will twine her downy neck</l>
     <l n="285">With thine , and welcome thy return with eyes</l>
     <l n="286">Bright in the lustre of their own fond joy .</l>
     <l n="287">And what am I that I should linger here , 285</l>
     <l n="288">With voice far sweeter than thy dying notes ,</l>
     <l n="289">Spirit more vast than thine , frame more attuned</l>
     <l n="290">To beauty , wasting these surpassing powers</l>
     <l n="291">In the deaf air , to the blind earth , and heaven</l>
     <l n="292">That echoes not my thoughts ? ’ A gloomy smile 290</l>
     <l n="293">Of desperate hope wrinkled his quivering lips .</l>
     <l n="294">For sleep , he knew , kept most relentlessly</l>
     <l n="295">Its precious charge , and silent death exposed ,</l>
     <l n="296">Faithless perhaps as sleep , a shadowy lure ,</l>
     <l n="297">With doubtful smile mocking its own strange charms . 295</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="298">Startled by his own thoughts he looked around .</l>

     <l n="300">Or sound of awe but in his own deep mind .</l>
     <l n="301">A little shallop floating near the shore</l>
     <l n="302">Caught the impatient wandering of his gaze . 300</l>
     <l n="303">It had been long abandoned , for its sides</l>
     <l n="304">Gaped wide with many a rift , and its frail joints</l>
     <l n="305">Swayed with the undulations of the tide .</l>
     <l n="306">A restless impulse urged him to embark</l>
     <l n="307">And meet lone Death on the drear ocean 's waste ; 305</l>
     <l n="308">For well he knew that mighty Shadow loves</l>

     <l n="310">The day was fair and sunny ; sea and sky</l>
     <l n="311">Drank its inspiring radiance , and the wind</l>

     <l n="313">Following his eager soul , the wanderer</l>
     <l n="314">Leaped in the boat , he spread his cloak aloft</l>
     <l n="315">On the bare mast , and took his lonely seat ,</l>
     <l n="316">And felt the boat speed o'er the tranquil sea</l>

     <l n="321">Along the dark and ruffled waters fled</l>
     <l n="322">The straining boat .— A whirlwind swept it on , 320</l>
     <l n="323">With fierce gusts and precipitating force ,</l>
     <l n="324">Through the white ridges of the chafed sea .</l>

     <l n="326">Their fierce necks writhed beneath the tempest 's scourge</l>
     <l n="327">Like serpents struggling in a vulture 's grasp . 325</l>
     <l n="328">Calm and rejoicing in the fearful war</l>

     <l n="335">Holding the steady helm . Evening came on ,</l>
     <l n="336">The beams of sunset hung their rainbow hues</l>
     <l n="337">High ‘ mid the shifting domes of sheeted spray 335</l>
     <l n="338">That canopied his path o'er the waste deep ;</l>
     <l n="339">Twilight , ascending slowly from the east ,</l>

     <l n="344">Of ocean 's mountainous waste to mutual war</l>
     <l n="345">Rushed in dark tumult thundering , as to mock</l>
     <l n="346">The calm and spangled sky . The little boat</l>
     <l n="347">Still fled before the storm ; still fled , like foam 345</l>
     <l n="348">Down the steep cataract of a wintry river ;</l>
     <l n="349">Now pausing on the edge of the riven wave ;</l>
     <l n="350">Now leaving far behind the bursting mass</l>
     <l n="351">That fell , convulsing ocean : safely fled —</l>

     <l n="354">At midnight</l>
     <l n="355">The moon arose ; and lo ! the ethereal cliffs</l>
     <l n="356">Of Caucasus , whose icy summits shone</l>
     <l n="357">Among the stars like sunlight , and around</l>

     <l n="365">Suspended on the sweep of the smooth wave ,</l>
     <l n="366">The little boat was driven . A cavern there</l>
     <l n="367">Yawned , and amid its slant and winding depths</l>
     <l n="368">Ingulfed the rushing sea . The boat fled on 365</l>

     <l n="383">Filled with one whirlpool all that ample chasm :</l>
     <l n="384">Stair above stair the eddying waters rose , 380</l>
     <l n="385">Circling immeasurably fast , and laved</l>
     <l n="386">With alternating dash the gnarled roots</l>

     <l n="390">A pool of treacherous and tremendous calm .</l>
     <l n="391">Seized by the sway of the ascending stream ,</l>
     <l n="392">With dizzy swiftness , round , and round , and round ,</l>
     <l n="393">Ridge after ridge the straining boat arose ,</l>

     <l n="395">Where , through an opening of the rocky bank ,</l>
     <l n="396">The waters overflow , and a smooth spot</l>
     <l n="397">Of glassy quiet mid those battling tides</l>

     <l n="399">Down the abyss ? Shall the reverting stress 395</l>
     <l n="400">Of that resistless gulf embosom it ?</l>
     <l n="401">Now shall it fall ?— A wandering stream of wind ,</l>
     <l n="402">Breathed from the west , has caught the expanded sail ,</l>
     <l n="403">And , lo ! with gentle motion , between banks</l>
     <l n="404">Of mossy slope , and on a placid stream , 400</l>
     <l n="405">Beneath a woven grove it sails , and , hark !</l>
     <l n="406">The ghastly torrent mingles its far roar ,</l>
     <l n="407">With the breeze murmuring in the musical woods .</l>
     <l n="408">Where the embowering trees recede , and leave</l>
     <l n="409">A little space of green expanse , the cove 405</l>
     <l n="410">Is closed by meeting banks , whose yellow flowers</l>
     <l n="411">For ever gaze on their own drooping eyes ,</l>
     <l n="412">Reflected in the crystal calm . The wave</l>
     <l n="413">Of the boat 's motion marred their pensive task ,</l>
     <l n="414">Which naught but vagrant bird , or wanton wind , 410</l>
     <l n="415">Or falling spear-grass , or their own decay</l>
     <l n="416">Had e'er disturbed before . The Poet longed</l>
     <l n="417">To deck with their bright hues his withered hair ,</l>
     <l n="418">But on his heart its solitude returned ,</l>
     <l n="419">And he forbore . Not the strong impulse hid 415</l>
     <l n="420">In those flushed cheeks , bent eyes , and shadowy frame</l>
     <l n="421">Had yet performed its ministry : it hung</l>
     <l n="422">Upon his life , as lightning in a cloud</l>
     <l n="423">Gleams , hovering ere it vanish , ere the floods</l>
     <l n="424">Of night close over it .</l>
     <l n="425">The noonday sun 420</l>
     <l n="426">Now shone upon the forest , one vast mass</l>
     <l n="427">Of mingling shade , whose brown magnificence</l>
     <l n="428">A narrow vale embosoms . There , huge caves ,</l>
     <l n="429">Scooped in the dark base of their aery rocks ,</l>
     <l n="430">Mocking its moans , respond and roar for ever . 425</l>
     <l n="431">The meeting boughs and implicated leaves</l>
     <l n="432">Wove twilight o'er the Poet 's path , as led</l>
     <l n="433">By love , or dream , or god , or mightier Death ,</l>
     <l n="434">He sought in Nature 's dearest haunt some bank ,</l>
     <l n="435">Her cradle , and his sepulchre . More dark 430</l>
     <l n="436">And dark the shades accumulate . The oak ,</l>
     <l n="437">Expanding its immense and knotty arms ,</l>
     <l n="438">Embraces the light beech . The pyramids</l>
     <l n="439">Of the tall cedar overarching frame</l>
     <l n="440">Most solemn domes within , and far below , 435</l>
     <l n="441">Like clouds suspended in an emerald sky ,</l>
     <l n="442">The ash and the acacia floating hang</l>
     <l n="443">Tremulous and pale . Like restless serpents , clothed</l>
     <l n="444">In rainbow and in fire , the parasites ,</l>
     <l n="445">Starred with ten thousand blossoms , flow around 440</l>
     <l n="446">The grey trunks , and , as gamesome infants ’ eyes ,</l>
     <l n="447">With gentle meanings , and most innocent wiles ,</l>
     <l n="448">Fold their beams round the hearts of those that love ,</l>
     <l n="449">These twine their tendrils with the wedded boughs</l>
     <l n="450">Uniting their close union ; the woven leaves 445</l>
     <l n="451">Make net-work of the dark blue light of day ,</l>
     <l n="452">And the night 's noontide clearness , mutable</l>
     <l n="453">As shapes in the weird clouds . Soft mossy lawns</l>
     <l n="454">Beneath these canopies extend their swells ,</l>
     <l n="455">Fragrant with perfumed herbs , and eyed with blooms 450</l>
     <l n="456">Minute yet beautiful . One darkest glen</l>
     <l n="457">Sends from its woods of musk-rose , twined with jasmine ,</l>
     <l n="458">A soul-dissolving odour to invite</l>
     <l n="459">To some more lovely mystery . Through the dell ,</l>
     <l n="460">Silence and Twilight here , twin-sisters , keep 455</l>
     <l n="461">Their noonday watch , and sail among the shades ,</l>
     <l n="462">Like vaporous shapes half-seen ; beyond , a well ,</l>
     <l n="463">Dark , gleaming , and of most translucent wave ,</l>
     <l n="464">Images all the woven boughs above ,</l>
     <l n="465">And each depending leaf , and every speck 460</l>
     <l n="466">Of azure sky , darting between their chasms ;</l>
     <l n="467">Nor aught else in the liquid mirror laves</l>
     <l n="468">Its portraiture , but some inconstant star</l>
     <l n="469">Between one foliaged lattice twinkling fair ,</l>
     <l n="470">Or painted bird , sleeping beneath the moon , 465</l>
     <l n="471">Or gorgeous insect floating motionless ,</l>
     <l n="472">Unconscious of the day , ere yet his wings</l>

     <l n="477">Of that still fountain ; as the human heart ,</l>
     <l n="478">Gazing in dreams over the gloomy grave ,</l>
     <l n="479">Sees its own treacherous likeness there . He heard</l>
     <l n="480">The motion of the leaves , the grass that sprung 475</l>
     <l n="481">Startled and glanced and trembled even to feel</l>
     <l n="482">An unaccustomed presence , and the sound</l>
     <l n="483">Of the sweet brook that from the secret springs</l>
     <l n="484">Of that dark fountain rose . A Spirit seemed</l>

     <l n="486">Of shadowy silver or enshrining light ,</l>
     <l n="487">Borrowed from aught the visible world affords</l>

     <l n="489">But , undulating woods , and silent well ,</l>
     <l n="490">And leaping rivulet , and evening gloom 485</l>
     <l n="491">Now deepening the dark shades , for speech assuming ,</l>
     <l n="492">Held commune with him , as if he and it</l>
     <l n="493">Were all that was ,— only ... when his regard</l>
     <l n="494">Was raised by intense pensiveness ,... two eyes ,</l>
     <l n="495">Two starry eyes , hung in the gloom of thought , 490</l>

     <l n="501">Wanton and wild , through many a green ravine 495</l>
     <l n="502">Beneath the forest flowed . Sometimes it fell</l>

     <l n="504">Dark and profound . Now on the polished stones</l>

     <l n="506">Then , through the plain in tranquil wanderings crept , 500</l>

     <l n="521">Beside the grassy shore</l>
     <l n="522">Of the small stream he went ; he did impress 515</l>
     <l n="523">On the green moss his tremulous step , that caught</l>
     <l n="524">Strong shuddering from his burning limbs . As one</l>
     <l n="525">Roused by some joyous madness from the couch</l>
     <l n="526">Of fever , he did move ; yet , not like him ,</l>
     <l n="527">Forgetful of the grave , where , when the flame 520</l>
     <l n="528">Of his frail exultation shall be spent ,</l>
     <l n="529">He must descend . With rapid steps he went</l>
     <l n="530">Beneath the shade of trees , beside the flow</l>
     <l n="531">Of the wild babbling rivulet ; and now</l>
     <l n="532">The forest 's solemn canopies were changed 525</l>
     <l n="533">For the uniform and lightsome evening sky .</l>
     <l n="534">Grey rocks did peep from the spare moss , and stemmed</l>
     <l n="535">The struggling brook ; tall spires of windlestrae</l>
     <l n="536">Threw their thin shadows down the rugged slope ,</l>
     <l n="537">And nought but gnarled roots of ancient pines 530</l>
     <l n="538">Branchless and blasted , clenched with grasping roots</l>
     <l n="539">The unwilling soil . A gradual change was here ,</l>

     <l n="546">And musical motions . Calm , he still pursued</l>
     <l n="547">The stream , that with a larger volume now 540</l>
     <l n="548">Rolled through the labyrinthine dell ; and there</l>
     <l n="549">Fretted a path through its descending curves</l>
     <l n="550">With its wintry speed . On every side now rose</l>
     <l n="551">Rocks , which , in unimaginable forms ,</l>
     <l n="552">Lifted their black and barren pinnacles 545</l>
     <l n="553">In the light of evening , and its precipice</l>
     <l n="554">Obscuring the ravine , disclosed above ,</l>
     <l n="555">Mid toppling stones , black gulfs and yawning caves ,</l>
     <l n="556">Whose windings gave ten thousand various tongues</l>
     <l n="557">To the loud stream . Lo ! where the pass expands 550</l>
     <l n="558">Its stony jaws , the abrupt mountain breaks ,</l>
     <l n="559">And seems , with its accumulated crags ,</l>
     <l n="560">To overhang the world : for wide expand</l>
     <l n="561">Beneath the wan stars and descending moon</l>
     <l n="562">Islanded seas , blue mountains , mighty streams , 555</l>
     <l n="563">Dim tracts and vast , robed in the lustrous gloom</l>

     <l n="567">In naked and severe simplicity , 560</l>
     <l n="568">Made contrast with the universe . A pine ,</l>
     <l n="569">Rock-rooted , stretched athwart the vacancy</l>
     <l n="570">Its swinging boughs , to each inconstant blast</l>
     <l n="571">Yielding one only response , at each pause</l>
     <l n="572">In most familiar cadence , with the howl 565</l>
     <l n="573">The thunder and the hiss of homeless streams</l>
     <l n="574">Mingling its solemn song , whilst the broad river</l>
     <l n="575">Foaming and hurrying o'er its rugged path ,</l>
     <l n="576">Fell into that immeasurable void</l>
     <l n="577">Scattering its waters to the passing winds . 570</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="578">Yet the grey precipice and solemn pine</l>
     <l n="579">And torrent were not all ;— one silent nook</l>
     <l n="580">Was there . Even on the edge of that vast mountain ,</l>
     <l n="581">Upheld by knotty roots and fallen rocks ,</l>
     <l n="582">It overlooked in its serenity 575</l>
     <l n="583">The dark earth , and the bending vault of stars .</l>
     <l n="584">It was a tranquil spot , that seemed to smile</l>
     <l n="585">Even in the lap of horror . Ivy clasped</l>
     <l n="586">The fissured stones with its entwining arms ,</l>
     <l n="587">And did embower with leaves for ever green , 580</l>
     <l n="588">And berries dark , the smooth and even space</l>

     <l n="590">The children of the autumnal whirlwind bore ,</l>
     <l n="591">In wanton sport , those bright leaves , whose decay ,</l>
     <l n="592">Red , yellow , or ethereally pale , 585</l>

     <l n="594">Of every gentle wind , whose breath can teach</l>
     <l n="595">The wilds to love tranquillity . One step ,</l>
     <l n="596">One human step alone , has ever broken</l>
     <l n="597">The stillness of its solitude :— one voice 590</l>
     <l n="598">Alone inspired its echoes ;— even that voice</l>
     <l n="599">Which hither came , floating among the winds ,</l>
     <l n="600">And led the loveliest among human forms</l>
     <l n="601">To make their wild haunts the depository</l>
     <l n="602">Of all the grace and beauty that endued 595</l>
     <l n="603">Its motions , render up its majesty ,</l>
     <l n="604">Scatter its music on the unfeeling storm ,</l>
     <l n="605">And to the damp leaves and blue cavern mould ,</l>
     <l n="606">Nurses of rainbow flowers and branching moss ,</l>
     <l n="607">Commit the colours of that varying cheek , 600</l>

   <p>NOTE ON ALASTOR , BY MRS. SHELLEY .</p>
   <p>“ Alastor ” is written in a very different tone from “ Queen Mab ” . In the latter , Shelley poured out all the cherished speculations of his youth — all the irrepressible emotions of sympathy , censure , and hope , to which the present suffering , and what he considers the proper destiny of his fellow-creatures , gave birth . “ Alastor ” , on the contrary , contains an individual interest only . A very few years , with their attendant events , had checked the ardour of Shelley 's hopes , though he still thought them well-grounded , and that to advance their fulfilment was the noblest task man could achieve .</p>
   <p>This is neither the time nor place to speak of the misfortunes that chequered his life . It will be sufficient to say that , in all he did , he at the time of doing it believed himself justified to his own conscience ; while the various ills of poverty and loss of friends brought home to him the sad realities of life . Physical suffering had also considerable influence in causing him to turn his eyes inward ; inclining him rather to brood over the thoughts and emotions of his own soul than to glance abroad , and to make , as in “ Queen Mab ” , the whole universe the object and subject of his song . In the Spring of 1815 , an eminent physician pronounced that he was dying rapidly of a consumption ; abscesses were formed on his lungs , and he suffered acute spasms . Suddenly a complete change took place ; and though through life he was a martyr to pain and debility , every symptom of pulmonary disease vanished . His nerves , which nature had formed sensitive to an unexampled degree , were rendered still more susceptible by the state of his health .</p>
   <p>As soon as the peace of 1814 had opened the Continent , he went abroad . He visited some of the more magnificent scenes of Switzerland , and returned to England from Lucerne , by the Reuss and the Rhine . This river-navigation enchanted him . In his favourite poem of “ Thalaba ” , his imagination had been excited by a description of such a voyage . In the summer of 1815 , after a tour along the southern coast of Devonshire and a visit to Clifton , he rented a house on Bishopgate Heath , on the borders of Windsor Forest , where he enjoyed several months of comparative health and tranquil happiness . The later summer months were warm and dry . Accompanied by a few friends , he visited the source of the Thames , making a voyage in a wherry from Windsor to Crichlade . His beautiful stanzas in the churchyard of Lechlade were written on that occasion . “ Alastor ” was composed on his return . He spent his days under the oak-shades of Windsor Great Park ; and the magnificent woodland was a fitting study to inspire the various descriptions of forest scenery we find in the poem .</p>
   <p>None of Shelley 's poems is more characteristic than this . The solemn spirit that reigns throughout , the worship of the majesty of nature , the broodings of a poet 's heart in solitude — the mingling of the exulting joy which the various aspects of the visible universe inspires with the sad and struggling pangs which human passion imparts — give a touching interest to the whole . The death which he had often contemplated during the last months as certain and near he here represented in such colours as had , in his lonely musings , soothed his soul to peace . The versification sustains the solemn spirit which breathes throughout : it is peculiarly melodious . The poem ought rather to be considered didactic than narrative : it was the outpouring of his own emotions , embodied in the purest form he could conceive , painted in the ideal hues which his brilliant imagination inspired , and softened by the recent anticipation of death .</p>

   <p>AUTHOR 'S PREFACE .</p>
   <p>The Poem which I now present to the world is an attempt from which I scarcely dare to expect success , and in which a writer of established fame might fail without disgrace . It is an experiment on the temper of the public mind , as to how far a thirst for a happier condition of moral and political society survives , among the enlightened and refined , the tempests which have shaken the age in which we live . I have sought to enlist the harmony of metrical language , the ethereal combinations of the fancy , the rapid and subtle transitions of human passion , all those elements which essentially compose a Poem , in the cause of a liberal and comprehensive morality ; and in the view of kindling within the bosoms of my readers a virtuous enthusiasm for those doctrines of liberty and justice , that faith and hope in something good , which neither violence nor misrepresentation nor prejudice can ever totally extinguish among mankind .</p>
   <p>For this purpose I have chosen a story of human passion in its most universal character , diversified with moving and romantic adventures , and appealing , in contempt of all artificial opinions or institutions , to the common sympathies of every human breast . I have made no attempt to recommend the motives which I would substitute for those at present governing mankind , by methodical and systematic argument . I would only awaken the feelings , so that the reader should see the beauty of true virtue , and be incited to those inquiries which have led to my moral and political creed , and that of some of the sublimest intellects in the world . The Poem therefore ( with the exception of the first canto , which is purely introductory ) is narrative , not didactic . It is a succession of pictures illustrating the growth and progress of individual mind aspiring after excellence , and devoted to the love of mankind ; its influence in refining and making pure the most daring and uncommon impulses of the imagination , the understanding , and the senses ; its impatience at ‘ all the oppressions which are done under the sun ; ’ its tendency to awaken public hope , and to enlighten and improve mankind ; the rapid effects of the application of that tendency ; the awakening of an immense nation from their slavery and degradation to a true sense of moral dignity and freedom ; the bloodless dethronement of their oppressors , and the unveiling of the religious frauds by which they had been deluded into submission ; the tranquillity of successful patriotism , and the universal toleration and benevolence of true philanthropy ; the treachery and barbarity of hired soldiers ; vice not the object of punishment and hatred , but kindness and pity ; the faithlessness of tyrants ; the confederacy of the Rulers of the World and the restoration of the expelled Dynasty by foreign arms ; the massacre and extermination of the Patriots , and the victory of established power ; the consequences of legitimate despotism ,— civil war , famine , plague , superstition , and an utter extinction of the domestic affections ; the judicial murder of the advocates of Liberty ; the temporary triumph of oppression , that secure earnest of its final and inevitable fall ; the transient nature of ignorance and error and the eternity of genius and virtue . Such is the series of delineations of which the Poem consists . And , if the lofty passions with which it has been my scope to distinguish this story shall not excite in the reader a generous impulse , an ardent thirst for excellence , an interest profound and strong such as belongs to no meaner desires , let not the failure be imputed to a natural unfitness for human sympathy in these sublime and animating themes . It is the business of the Poet to communicate to others the pleasure and the enthusiasm arising out of those images and feelings in the vivid presence of which within his own mind consists at once his inspiration and his reward .</p>
   <p>The panic which , like an epidemic transport , seized upon all classes of men during the excesses consequent upon the French Revolution , is gradually giving place to sanity . It has ceased to be believed that whole generations of mankind ought to consign themselves to a hopeless inheritance of ignorance and misery , because a nation of men who had been dupes and slaves for centuries were incapable of conducting themselves with the wisdom and tranquillity of freemen so soon as some of their fetters were partially loosened . That their conduct could not have been marked by any other characters than ferocity and thoughtlessness is the historical fact from which liberty derives all its recommendations , and falsehood the worst features of its deformity . There is a reflux in the tide of human things which bears the shipwrecked hopes of men into a secure haven after the storms are past . Methinks , those who now live have survived an age of despair .</p>
   <p>The French Revolution may be considered as one of those manifestations of a general state of feeling among civilised mankind produced by a defect of correspondence between the knowledge existing in society and the improvement or gradual abolition of political institutions . The year 1788 may be assumed as the epoch of one of the most important crises produced by this feeling . The sympathies connected with that event extended to every bosom . The most generous and amiable natures were those which participated the most extensively in these sympathies . But such a degree of unmingled good was expected as it was impossible to realise . If the Revolution had been in every respect prosperous , then misrule and superstition would lose half their claims to our abhorrence , as fetters which the captive can unlock with the slightest motion of his fingers , and which do not eat with poisonous rust into the soul . The revulsion occasioned by the atrocities of the demagogues , and the re-establishment of successive tyrannies in France , was terrible , and felt in the remotest corner of the civilised world . Could they listen to the plea of reason who had groaned under the calamities of a social state according to the provisions of which one man riots in luxury whilst another famishes for want of bread ? Can he who the day before was a trampled slave suddenly become liberal-minded , forbearing , and independent ? This is the consequence of the habits of a state of society to be produced by resolute perseverance and indefatigable hope , and long-suffering and long-believing courage , and the systematic efforts of generations of men of intellect and virtue . Such is the lesson which experience teaches now . But , on the first reverses of hope in the progress of French liberty , the sanguine eagerness for good overleaped the solution of these questions , and for a time extinguished itself in the unexpectedness of their result . Thus , many of the most ardent and tender-hearted of the worshippers of public good have been morally ruined by what a partial glimpse of the events they deplored appeared to show as the melancholy desolation of all their cherished hopes . Hence gloom and misanthropy have become the characteristics of the age in which we live , the solace of a disappointment that unconsciously finds relief only in the wilful exaggeration of its own despair . This influence has tainted the literature of the age with the hopelessness of the minds from which it flows . Metaphysics ( I ought to except sir W. Drummond 's “ Academical Questions ” ; a volume of very acute and powerful metaphysical criticism . ) , and inquiries into moral and political science , have become little else than vain attempts to revive exploded superstitions , or sophisms like those of Mr. Malthus ( It is remarkable , as a symptom of the revival of public hope , that Mr. Malthus has assigned , in the later editions of his work , an indefinite dominion to moral restraint over the principle of population . This concession answers all the inferences from his doctrine unfavourable to human improvement , and reduces the “ Essay on Population ” to a commentary illustrative of the unanswerableness of “ Political Justice ” . ) , calculated to lull the oppressors of mankind into a security of everlasting triumph . Our works of fiction and poetry have been overshadowed by the same infectious gloom . But mankind appear to me to be emerging from their trance . I am aware , methinks , of a slow , gradual , silent change . In that belief I have composed the following Poem .</p>
   <p>I do not presume to enter into competition with our greatest contemporary Poets . Yet I am unwilling to tread in the footsteps of any who have preceded me . I have sought to avoid the imitation of any style of language or versification peculiar to the original minds of which it is the character ; designing that , even if what I have produced be worthless , it should still be properly my own . Nor have I permitted any system relating to mere words to divert the attention of the reader , from whatever interest I may have succeeded in creating , to my own ingenuity in contriving to disgust them according to the rules of criticism . I have simply clothed my thoughts in what appeared to me the most obvious and appropriate language . A person familiar with nature , and with the most celebrated productions of the human mind , can scarcely err in following the instinct , with respect to selection of language , produced by that familiarity .</p>
   <p>There is an education peculiarly fitted for a Poet , without which genius and sensibility can hardly fill the circle of their capacities . No education , indeed , can entitle to this appellation a dull and unobservant mind , or one , though neither dull nor unobservant , in which the channels of communication between thought and expression have been obstructed or closed . How far it is my fortune to belong to either of the latter classes I cannot know . I aspire to be something better . The circumstances of my accidental education have been favourable to this ambition . I have been familiar from boyhood with mountains and lakes and the sea , and the solitude of forests : Danger , which sports upon the brink of precipices , has been my playmate . I have trodden the glaciers of the Alps , and lived under the eye of Mont Blanc . I have been a wanderer among distant fields . I have sailed down mighty rivers , and seen the sun rise and set , and the stars come forth , whilst I have sailed night and day down a rapid stream among mountains . I have seen populous cities , and have watched the passions which rise and spread , and sink and change , amongst assembled multitudes of men . I have seen the theatre of the more visible ravages of tyranny and war , cities and villages reduced to scattered groups of black and roofless houses , and the naked inhabitants sitting famished upon their desolated thresholds . I have conversed with living men of genius . The poetry of ancient Greece and Rome , and modern Italy , and our own country , has been to me , like external nature , a passion and an enjoyment . Such are the sources from which the materials for the imagery of my Poem have been drawn . I have considered Poetry in its most comprehensive sense ; and have read the Poets and the Historians and the Metaphysicians ( In this sense there may be such a thing as perfectibility in works of fiction , notwithstanding the concession often made by the advocates of human improvement , that perfectibility is a term applicable only to science . ) whose writings have been accessible to me , and have looked upon the beautiful and majestic scenery of the earth , as common sources of those elements which it is the province of the Poet to embody and combine . Yet the experience and the feelings to which I refer do not in themselves constitute men Poets , but only prepares them to be the auditors of those who are . How far I shall be found to possess that more essential attribute of Poetry , the power of awakening in others sensations like those which animate my own bosom , is that which , to speak sincerely , I know not ; and which , with an acquiescent and contented spirit , I expect to be taught by the effect which I shall produce upon those whom I now address .</p>
   <p>I have avoided , as I have said before , the imitation of any contemporary style . But there must be a resemblance , which does not depend upon their own will , between all the writers of any particular age . They cannot escape from subjection to a common influence which arises out of an infinite combination of circumstances belonging to the times in which they live ; though each is in a degree the author of the very influence by which his being is thus pervaded . Thus , the tragic poets of the age of Pericles ; the Italian revivers of ancient learning ; those mighty intellects of our own country that succeeded the Reformation , the translators of the Bible , Shakespeare , Spenser , the Dramatists of the reign of Elizabeth , and Lord Bacon ( Milton stands alone in the age which he illumined . ) ; the colder spirits of the interval that succeeded ;— all resemble each other , and differ from every other in their several classes . In this view of things , Ford can no more be called the imitator of Shakespeare than Shakespeare the imitator of Ford . There were perhaps few other points of resemblance between these two men than that which the universal and inevitable influence of their age produced . And this is an influence which neither the meanest scribbler nor the sublimest genius of any era can escape ; and which I have not attempted to escape .</p>
   <p>I have adopted the stanza of Spenser ( a measure inexpressibly beautiful ) , not because I consider it a finer model of poetical harmony than the blank verse of Shakespeare and Milton , but because in the latter there is no shelter for mediocrity ; you must either succeed or fail . This perhaps an aspiring spirit should desire . But I was enticed also by the brilliancy and magnificence of sound which a mind that has been nourished upon musical thoughts can produce by a just and harmonious arrangement of the pauses of this measure . Yet there will be found some instances where I have completely failed in this attempt , and one , which I here request the reader to consider as an erratum , where there is left , most inadvertently , an alexandrine in the middle of a stanza .</p>
   <p>But in this , as in every other respect , I have written fearlessly . It is the misfortune of this age that its Writers , too thoughtless of immortality , are exquisitely sensible to temporary praise or blame . They write with the fear of Reviews before their eyes . This system of criticism sprang up in that torpid interval when Poetry was not . Poetry , and the art which professes to regulate and limit its powers , cannot subsist together . Longinus could not have been the contemporary of Homer , nor Boileau of Horace . Yet this species of criticism never presumed to assert an understanding of its own ; it has always , unlike true science , followed , not preceded , the opinion of mankind , and would even now bribe with worthless adulation some of our greatest Poets to impose gratuitous fetters on their own imaginations , and become unconscious accomplices in the daily murder of all genius either not so aspiring or not so fortunate as their own . I have sought therefore to write , as I believe that Homer , Shakespeare , and Milton wrote , with an utter disregard of anonymous censure . I am certain that calumny and misrepresentation , though it may move me to compassion , cannot disturb my peace . I shall understand the expressive silence of those sagacious enemies who dare not trust themselves to speak . I shall endeavour to extract , from the midst of insult and contempt and maledictions , those admonitions which may tend to correct whatever imperfections such censurers may discover in this my first serious appeal to the Public . If certain Critics were as clear-sighted as they are malignant , how great would be the benefit to be derived from their virulent writings ! As it is , I fear I shall be malicious enough to be amused with their paltry tricks and lame invectives . Should the Public judge that my composition is worthless , I shall indeed bow before the tribunal from which Milton received his crown of immortality , and shall seek to gather , if I live , strength from that defeat , which may nerve me to some new enterprise of thought which may not be worthless . I cannot conceive that Lucretius , when he meditated that poem whose doctrines are yet the basis of our metaphysical knowledge , and whose eloquence has been the wonder of mankind , wrote in awe of such censure as the hired sophists of the impure and superstitious noblemen of Rome might affix to what he should produce . It was at the period when Greece was led captive and Asia made tributary to the Republic , fast verging itself to slavery and ruin , that a multitude of Syrian captives , bigoted to the worship of their obscene Ashtaroth , and the unworthy successors of Socrates and Zeno , found there a precarious subsistence by administering , under the name of freedmen , to the vices and vanities of the great . These wretched men were skilled to plead , with a superficial but plausible set of sophisms , in favour of that contempt for virtue which is the portion of slaves , and that faith in portents , the most fatal substitute for benevolence in the imaginations of men , which , arising from the enslaved communities of the East , then first began to overwhelm the western nations in its stream . Were these the kind of men whose disapprobation the wise and lofty-minded Lucretius should have regarded with a salutary awe ? The latest and perhaps the meanest of those who follow in his footsteps would disdain to hold life on such conditions .</p>
   <p>The Poem now presented to the Public occupied little more than six months in the composition . That period has been devoted to the task with unremitting ardour and enthusiasm . I have exercised a watchful and earnest criticism on my work as it grew under my hands . I would willingly have sent it forth to the world with that perfection which long labour and revision is said to bestow . But I found that , if I should gain something in exactness by this method , I might lose much of the newness and energy of imagery and language as it flowed fresh from my mind . And , although the mere composition occupied no more than six months , the thoughts thus arranged were slowly gathered in as many years .</p>
   <p>I trust that the reader will carefully distinguish between those opinions which have a dramatic propriety in reference to the characters which they are designed to elucidate , and such as are properly my own . The erroneous and degrading idea which men have conceived of a Supreme Being , for instance , is spoken against , but not the Supreme Being itself . The belief which some superstitious persons whom I have brought upon the stage entertain of the Deity , as injurious to the character of his benevolence , is widely different from my own . In recommending also a great and important change in the spirit which animates the social institutions of mankind , I have avoided all flattery to those violent and malignant passions of our nature which are ever on the watch to mingle with and to alloy the most beneficial innovations . There is no quarter given to Revenge , or Envy , or Prejudice . Love is celebrated everywhere as the sole law which should govern the moral world .</p>

     <l n="2">The old man took the oars , and soon the bark</l>
     <l n="3">Smote on the beach beside a tower of stone ; 1415</l>
     <l n="4">It was a crumbling heap , whose portal dark</l>
     <l n="5">With blooming ivy-trails was overgrown ;</l>
     <l n="6">Upon whose floor the spangling sands were strown ,</l>
     <l n="7">And rarest sea-shells , which the eternal flood ,</l>
     <l n="8">Slave to the mother of the months , had thrown 1420</l>
     <l n="9">Within the walls of that gray tower , which stood</l>
     <l n="10">A changeling of man 's art nursed amid Nature 's brood .</l>

     <l n="13">He wound me in his arms with tender care ,</l>
     <l n="14">And very few , but kindly words he said , 1425</l>
     <l n="15">And bore me through the tower adown a stair ,</l>
     <l n="16">Whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear</l>
     <l n="17">For many a year had fallen .— We came at last</l>
     <l n="18">To a small chamber , which with mosses rare</l>
     <l n="19">Was tapestried , where me his soft hands placed 1430</l>

     <l n="24">So warm , that to admit the dewy breeze ,</l>
     <l n="25">The old man opened them ; the moonlight lay 1435</l>
     <l n="26">Upon a lake whose waters wove their play</l>
     <l n="27">Even to the threshold of that lonely home :</l>
     <l n="28">Within was seen in the dim wavering ray</l>
     <l n="29">The antique sculptured roof , and many a tome</l>

     <l n="35">And snowy mountains :— did my spirit wake</l>
     <l n="36">From sleep as many-coloured as the snake 1445</l>
     <l n="37">That girds eternity ? in life and truth ,</l>
     <l n="38">Might not my heart its cravings ever slake ?</l>

     <l n="44">With supernatural shades of clinging sadness ;</l>
     <l n="45">That gentle Hermit , in my helpless woe ,</l>
     <l n="46">By my sick couch was busy to and fro ,</l>
     <l n="47">Like a strong spirit ministrant of good : 1455</l>
     <l n="48">When I was healed , he led me forth to show</l>
     <l n="49">The wonders of his sylvan solitude ,</l>

     <l n="55">That thrilling name had ceased to make me start ,</l>
     <l n="56">From his familiar lips — it was not art ,</l>
     <l n="57">Of wisdom and of justice when he spoke —</l>
     <l n="58">When mid soft looks of pity , there would dart 1465</l>

     <l n="97">Each heart was there a shield , and every tongue 1500</l>

   <p>NOTE ON THE “ REVOLT OF ISLAM ” , BY MRS. SHELLEY .</p>
   <p>Shelley possessed two remarkable qualities of intellect — a brilliant imagination , and a logical exactness of reason . His inclinations led him ( he fancied ) almost alike to poetry and metaphysical discussions . I say ‘ he fancied , ’ because I believe the former to have been paramount , and that it would have gained the mastery even had he struggled against it . However , he said that he deliberated at one time whether he should dedicate himself to poetry or metaphysics ; and , resolving on the former , he educated himself for it , discarding in a great measure his philosophical pursuits , and engaging himself in the study of the poets of Greece , Italy , and England . To these may be added a constant perusal of portions of the old Testament — the Psalms , the Book of Job , the Prophet Isaiah , and others , the sublime poetry of which filled him with delight .</p>
   <p>As a poet , his intellect and compositions were powerfully influenced by exterior circumstances , and especially by his place of abode . He was very fond of travelling , and ill-health increased this restlessness . The sufferings occasioned by a cold English winter made him pine , especially when our colder spring arrived , for a more genial climate . In 1816 he again visited Switzerland , and rented a house on the banks of the Lake of Geneva ; and many a day , in cloud or sunshine , was passed alone in his boat — sailing as the wind listed , or weltering on the calm waters . The majestic aspect of Nature ministered such thoughts as he afterwards enwove in verse . His lines on the Bridge of the Arve , and his “ Hymn to Intellectual Beauty ” , were written at this time . Perhaps during this summer his genius was checked by association with another poet whose nature was utterly dissimilar to his own , yet who , in the poem he wrote at that time , gave tokens that he shared for a period the more abstract and etherealised inspiration of Shelley . The saddest events awaited his return to England ; but such was his fear to wound the feelings of others that he never expressed the anguish he felt , and seldom gave vent to the indignation roused by the persecutions he underwent ; while the course of deep unexpressed passion , and the sense of injury , engendered the desire to embody themselves in forms defecated of all the weakness and evil which cling to real life .</p>
   <p>He chose therefore for his hero a youth nourished in dreams of liberty , some of whose actions are in direct opposition to the opinions of the world ; but who is animated throughout by an ardent love of virtue , and a resolution to confer the boons of political and intellectual freedom on his fellow-creatures . He created for this youth a woman such as he delighted to imagine — full of enthusiasm for the same objects ; and they both , with will unvanquished , and the deepest sense of the justice of their cause , met adversity and death . There exists in this poem a memorial of a friend of his youth . The character of the old man who liberates Laon from his tower prison , and tends on him in sickness , is founded on that of Doctor Lind , who , when Shelley was at Eton , had often stood by to befriend and support him , and whose name he never mentioned without love and veneration .</p>
   <p>During the year 1817 we were established at Marlow in Buckinghamshire . Shelley 's choice of abode was fixed chiefly by this town being at no great distance from London , and its neighbourhood to the Thames . The poem was written in his boat , as it floated under the beech groves of Bisham , or during wanderings in the neighbouring country , which is distinguished for peculiar beauty . The chalk hills break into cliffs that overhang the Thames , or form valleys clothed with beech ; the wilder portion of the country is rendered beautiful by exuberant vegetation ; and the cultivated part is peculiarly fertile . With all this wealth of Nature which , either in the form of gentlemen 's parks or soil dedicated to agriculture , flourishes around , Marlow was inhabited ( I hope it is altered now ) by a very poor population . The women are lacemakers , and lose their health by sedentary labour , for which they were very ill paid . The Poor-laws ground to the dust not only the paupers , but those who had risen just above that state , and were obliged to pay poor-rates . The changes produced by peace following a long war , and a bad harvest , brought with them the most heart-rending evils to the poor . Shelley afforded what alleviation he could . In the winter , while bringing out his poem , he had a severe attack of ophthalmia , caught while visiting the poor cottages . I mention these things ,— for this minute and active sympathy with his fellow-creatures gives a thousandfold interest to his speculations , and stamps with reality his pleadings for the human race .</p>
   <p>The poem , bold in its opinions and uncompromising in their expression , met with many censurers , not only among those who allow of no virtue but such as supports the cause they espouse , but even among those whose opinions were similar to his own . I extract a portion of a letter written in answer to one of these friends . It best details the impulses of Shelley 's mind , and his motives : it was written with entire unreserve ; and is therefore a precious monument of his own opinion of his powers , of the purity of his designs , and the ardour with which he clung , in adversity and through the valley of the shadow of death , to views from which he believed the permanent happiness of mankind must eventually spring .</p>
   <p>‘ Marlowe , December 11 , 1817 .</p>
   <p>‘ I have read and considered all that you say about my general powers , and the particular instance of the poem in which I have attempted to develop them . Nothing can be more satisfactory to me than the interest which your admonitions express . But I think you are mistaken in some points with regard to the peculiar nature of my powers , whatever be their amount . I listened with deference and self-suspicion to your censures of “ The Revolt of Islam ” ; but the productions of mine which you commend hold a very low place in my own esteem ; and this reassures me , in some degree at least . The poem was produced by a series of thoughts which filled my mind with unbounded and sustained enthusiasm . I felt the precariousness of my life , and I engaged in this task , resolved to leave some record of myself . Much of what the volume contains was written with the same feeling — as real , though not so prophetic — as the communications of a dying man . I never presumed indeed to consider it anything approaching to faultless ; but , when I consider contemporary productions of the same apparent pretensions , I own I was filled with confidence . I felt that it was in many respects a genuine picture of my own mind . I felt that the sentiments were true , not assumed . And in this have I long believed that my power consists ; in sympathy , and that part of the imagination which relates to sentiment and contemplation . I am formed , if for anything not in common with the herd of mankind , to apprehend minute and remote distinctions of feeling , whether relative to external nature or the living beings which surround us , and to communicate the conceptions which result from considering either the moral or the material universe as a whole . Of course , I believe these faculties , which perhaps comprehend all that is sublime in man , to exist very imperfectly in my own mind . But , when you advert to my Chancery-paper , a cold , forced , unimpassioned , insignificant piece of cramped and cautious argument , and to the little scrap about “ Mandeville ” , which expressed my feelings indeed , but cost scarcely two minutes ’ thought to express , as specimens of my powers more favourable than that which grew as it were from “ the agony and bloody sweat ” of intellectual travail ; surely I must feel that , in some manner , either I am mistaken in believing that I have any talent at all , or you in the selection of the specimens of it . Yet , after all , I cannot but be conscious , in much of what I write , of an absence of that tranquillity which is the attribute and accompaniment of power . This feeling alone would make your most kind and wise admonitions , on the subject of the economy of intellectual force , valuable to me . And , if I live , or if I see any trust in coming years , doubt not but that I shall do something , whatever it may be , which a serious and earnest estimate of my powers will suggest to me , and which will be in every respect accommodated to their utmost limits .</p>

   <p>PRINCE ATHANASE .</p>
   <p>A FRAGMENT .</p>
   <p>( The idea Shelley had formed of Prince Athanase was a good deal modelled on “ Alastor ” . In the first sketch of the poem , he named it “ Pandemos and Urania ” . Athanase seeks through the world the One whom he may love . He meets , in the ship in which he is embarked , a lady who appears to him to embody his ideal of love and beauty . But she proves to be Pandemos , or the earthly and unworthy Venus ; who , after disappointing his cherished dreams and hopes , deserts him . Athanase , crushed by sorrow , pines and dies . ‘ On his deathbed , the lady who can really reply to his soul comes and kisses his lips ’ ( “ The Deathbed of Athanase ” ) . The poet describes her [ in the words of the final fragment , page 164 ] . This slender note is all we have to aid our imagination in shaping out the form of the poem , such as its author imagined . [ Mrs. Shelley 's Note . ])</p>

     <l n="28">That from such toil he never found relief .</l>

   <p>ROSALIND AND HELEN .</p>
   <p>A MODERN ECLOGUE .</p>
   <note>Begun at Marlow , 1817 ( summer ) ; already in the press , March , 1818 ; finished at the Baths of Lucca , August , 1818 ; published with other poems , as the title-piece of a slender volume , by C. &amp; J. Ollier , London , 1819 ( spring ) . See “ Biographical List ” . Sources of the text are ( 1 ) editio princeps , 1819 ; ( 2 ) “ Poetical Works ” , edition Mrs. Shelley , 1839 , editions 1st and 2nd . A fragment of the text is amongst the Boscombe manuscripts . The poem is reprinted here from the editio princeps ; verbal alterations are recorded in the footnotes , punctual in the Editor 's Notes at the end of Volume 3 .</note>
   <p>ADVERTISEMENT .</p>
   <p>The story of “ Rosalind and Helen ” is , undoubtedly , not an attempt in the highest style of poetry . It is in no degree calculated to excite profound meditation ; and if , by interesting the affections and amusing the imagination , it awakens a certain ideal melancholy favourable to the reception of more important impressions , it will produce in the reader all that the writer experienced in the composition . I resigned myself , as I wrote , to the impulses of the feelings which moulded the conception of the story ; and this impulse determined the pauses of a measure , which only pretends to be regular inasmuch as it corresponds with , and expresses , the irregularity of the imaginations which inspired it .</p>
   <p>I do not know which of the few scattered poems I left in England will be selected by my bookseller to add to this collection . One ( “ Lines written among the Euganean Hills ” .— Editor . ) , which I sent from Italy , was written after a day 's excursion among those lovely mountains which surround what was once the retreat , and where is now the sepulchre , of Petrarch . If any one is inclined to condemn the insertion of the introductory lines , which image forth the sudden relief of a state of deep despondency by the radiant visions disclosed by the sudden burst of an Italian sunrise in autumn on the highest peak of those delightful mountains , I can only offer as my excuse , that they were not erased at the request of a dear friend , with whom added years of intercourse only add to my apprehension of its value , and who would have had more right than any one to complain , that she has not been able to extinguish in me the very power of delineating sadness .</p>
   <p>Naples , December 20 , 1818 .</p>
   <p>ROSALIND , HELEN , AND HER CHILD .</p>
   <p>SCENE . THE SHORE OF THE LAKE OF COMO .</p>
   <p>HELEN : Come hither , my sweet Rosalind . ‘ Tis long since thou and I have met ; And yet methinks it were unkind Those moments to forget . Come , sit by me . I see thee stand 5 By this lone lake , in this far land , Thy loose hair in the light wind flying , Thy sweet voice to each tone of even United , and thine eyes replying To the hues of yon fair heaven . 10 Come , gentle friend : wilt sit by me ? And be as thou wert wont to be Ere we were disunited ? None doth behold us now ; the power That led us forth at this lone hour 15 Will be but ill requited If thou depart in scorn : oh ! come , And talk of our abandoned home . Remember , this is Italy , And we are exiles . Talk with me 20 Of that our land , whose wilds and floods , Barren and dark although they be , Were dearer than these chestnut woods : Those heathy paths , that inland stream , And the blue mountains , shapes which seem 25 Like wrecks of childhood 's sunny dream : Which that we have abandoned now , Weighs on the heart like that remorse Which altered friendship leaves . I seek No more our youthful intercourse . 30 That cannot be ! Rosalind , speak . Speak to me . Leave me not .— When morn did come , When evening fell upon our common home , When for one hour we parted ,— do not frown : I would not chide thee , though thy faith is broken : 35 But turn to me . Oh ! by this cherished token , Of woven hair , which thou wilt not disown , Turn , as ‘ twere but the memory of me , And not my scorned self who prayed to thee .</p>
   <p>ROSALIND : Is it a dream , or do I see 40 And hear frail Helen ? I would flee Thy tainting touch ; but former years Arise , and bring forbidden tears ; And my o'erburthened memory Seeks yet its lost repose in thee . 45 I share thy crime . I cannot choose But weep for thee : mine own strange grief But seldom stoops to such relief : Nor ever did I love thee less , Though mourning o'er thy wickedness 50 Even with a sister 's woe . I knew What to the evil world is due , And therefore sternly did refuse To link me with the infamy Of one so lost as Helen . Now 55 Bewildered by my dire despair , Wondering I blush , and weep that thou Should'st love me still ,— thou only !— There , Let us sit on that gray stone Till our mournful talk be done . 60</p>
   <p>HELEN : Alas ! not there ; I cannot bear The murmur of this lake to hear . A sound from there , Rosalind dear , Which never yet I heard elsewhere But in our native land , recurs , 65 Even here where now we meet . It stirs Too much of suffocating sorrow ! In the dell of yon dark chestnutwood Is a stone seat , a solitude Less like our own . The ghost of Peace 70 Will not desert this spot . To-morrow , If thy kind feelings should not cease , We may sit here .</p>
   <p>ROSALIND : Thou lead , my sweet , And I will follow .</p>
   <p>HENRY : ‘ Tis Fenici 's seat Where you are going ? This is not the way , 75 Mamma ; it leads behind those trees that grow Close to the little river .</p>
   <p>HELEN : Yes : I know ; I was bewildered . Kiss me and be gay , Dear boy : why do you sob ?</p>
   <p>HENRY : I do not know : But it might break any one 's heart to see 80 You and the lady cry so bitterly .</p>
   <p>HELEN : It is a gentle child , my friend . Go home , Henry , and play with Lilla till I come . We only cried with joy to see each other ; We are quite merry now : Good-night .</p>

     <l n="1">The boy 85</l>
     <l n="2">Lifted a sudden look upon his mother ,</l>
     <l n="3">And in the gleam of forced and hollow joy</l>
     <l n="4">Which lightened o'er her face , laughed with the glee</l>
     <l n="5">Of light and unsuspecting infancy ,</l>
     <l n="6">And whispered in her ear , ‘ Bring home with you 90</l>
     <l n="7">That sweet strange lady-friend . ’ Then off he flew ,</l>
     <l n="8">But stopped , and beckoned with a meaning smile ,</l>
     <l n="9">Where the road turned . Pale Rosalind the while ,</l>
     <l n="10">Hiding her face , stood weeping silently .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">In silence then they took the way 95</l>
     <l n="12">Beneath the forest 's solitude .</l>
     <l n="13">It was a vast and antique wood ,</l>
     <l n="14">Thro ’ which they took their way ;</l>
     <l n="15">And the gray shades of evening</l>
     <l n="16">O'er that green wilderness did fling 100</l>
     <l n="17">Still deeper solitude .</l>
     <l n="18">Pursuing still the path that wound</l>
     <l n="19">The vast and knotted trees around</l>
     <l n="20">Through which slow shades were wandering ,</l>
     <l n="21">To a deep lawny dell they came , 105</l>
     <l n="22">To a stone seat beside a spring ,</l>
     <l n="23">O'er which the columned wood did frame</l>
     <l n="24">A roofless temple , like the fane</l>
     <l n="25">Where , ere new creeds could faith obtain ,</l>
     <l n="26">Man 's early race once knelt beneath 110</l>
     <l n="27">The overhanging deity .</l>
     <l n="28">O'er this fair fountain hung the sky ,</l>
     <l n="29">Now spangled with rare stars . The snake ,</l>
     <l n="30">The pale snake , that with eager breath</l>
     <l n="31">Creeps here his noontide thirst to slake , 115</l>
     <l n="32">Is beaming with many a mingled hue ,</l>
     <l n="33">Shed from yon dome 's eternal blue ,</l>
     <l n="34">When he floats on that dark and lucid flood</l>
     <l n="35">In the light of his own loveliness ;</l>
     <l n="36">And the birds that in the fountain dip 120</l>
     <l n="37">Their plumes , with fearless fellowship</l>
     <l n="38">Above and round him wheel and hover .</l>
     <l n="39">The fitful wind is heard to stir</l>
     <l n="40">One solitary leaf on high ;</l>
     <l n="41">The chirping of the grasshopper 125</l>
     <l n="42">Fills every pause . There is emotion</l>
     <l n="43">In all that dwells at noontide here ;</l>
     <l n="44">Then , through the intricate wild wood ,</l>
     <l n="45">A maze of life and light and motion</l>
     <l n="46">Is woven . But there is stillness now : 130</l>
     <l n="47">Gloom , and the trance of Nature now :</l>
     <l n="48">The snake is in his cave asleep ;</l>
     <l n="49">The birds are on the branches dreaming :</l>
     <l n="50">Only the shadows creep :</l>
     <l n="51">Only the glow-worm is gleaming : 135</l>
     <l n="52">Only the owls and the nightingales</l>
     <l n="53">Wake in this dell when daylight fails ,</l>
     <l n="54">And gray shades gather in the woods :</l>
     <l n="55">And the owls have all fled far away</l>
     <l n="56">In a merrier glen to hoot and play , 140</l>
     <l n="57">For the moon is veiled and sleeping now .</l>
     <l n="58">The accustomed nightingale still broods</l>
     <l n="59">On her accustomed bough ,</l>
     <l n="60">But she is mute ; for her false mate</l>
     <l n="61">Has fled and left her desolate . 145</l>

     <l n="67">The ghost of a youth with hoary hair ,</l>

   <p>ROSALIND : I saw the dark earth fall upon The coffin ; and I saw the stone 220 Laid over him whom this cold breast Had pillowed to his nightly rest ! Thou knowest not , thou canst not know My agony . Oh ! I could not weep : The sources whence such blessings flow 225 Were not to be approached by me ! But I could smile , and I could sleep , Though with a self-accusing heart . In morning 's light , in evening 's gloom , I watched ,— and would not thence depart — 230 My husband 's unlamented tomb . My children knew their sire was gone , But when I told them ,— ‘ He is dead , ’ — They laughed aloud in frantic glee , They clapped their hands and leaped about , 235 Answering each other 's ecstasy With many a prank and merry shout . But I sate silent and alone , Wrapped in the mock of mourning weed .</p>

     <l n="6">Till from that self-contention came 245</l>

     <l n="78">He smiled with such a woeful smile !</l>
     <l n="79">When he was in the churchyard lying</l>
     <l n="80">Among the worms , we grew quite poor ,</l>
     <l n="81">So that no one would give us bread : 320</l>
     <l n="82">My mother looked at me , and said</l>
     <l n="83">Faint words of cheer , which only meant</l>

   <p>HELEN : O speak not so , But come to me and pour thy woe 570 Into this heart , full though it be , Ay , overflowing with its own : I thought that grief had severed me From all beside who weep and groan ; Its likeness upon earth to be , 575 Its express image ; but thou art More wretched . Sweet ! we will not part Henceforth , if death be not division ; If so , the dead feel no contrition . But wilt thou hear since last we parted 580 All that has left me broken hearted ?</p>
   <p>ROSALIND : Yes , speak . The faintest stars are scarcely shorn Of their thin beams by that delusive morn Which sinks again in darkness , like the light Of early love , soon lost in total night . 585</p>
   <p>HELEN : Alas ! Italian winds are mild , But my bosom is cold — wintry cold — When the warm air weaves , among the fresh leaves , Soft music , my poor brain is wild , And I am weak like a nursling child , 590 Though my soul with grief is gray and old .</p>
   <p>ROSALIND : Weep not at thine own words , though they must make Me weep . What is thy tale ?</p>
   <p>HELEN : I fear ‘ twill shake Thy gentle heart with tears . Thou well Rememberest when we met no more , 595 And , though I dwelt with Lionel , That friendless caution pierced me sore With grief ; a wound my spirit bore Indignantly , but when he died , With him lay dead both hope and pride . 600 Alas ! all hope is buried now . But then men dreamed the aged earth Was labouring in that mighty birth , Which many a poet and a sage Has aye foreseen — the happy age 605 When truth and love shall dwell below Among the works and ways of men ; Which on this world not power but will Even now is wanting to fulfil .</p>

     <l n="199">They did become infectious : sweet</l>
     <l n="200">And subtle mists of sense and thought :</l>
     <l n="201">Which wrapped us soon , when we might meet , 810</l>
     <l n="202">Almost from our own looks and aught</l>
     <l n="203">The wild world holds . And so , his mind</l>
     <l n="204">Was healed , while mine grew sick with fear :</l>
     <l n="205">For ever now his health declined ,</l>
     <l n="206">Like some frail bark which cannot bear 815</l>
     <l n="207">The impulse of an altered wind ,</l>
     <l n="208">Though prosperous : and my heart grew full</l>
     <l n="209">‘ Mid its new joy of a new care :</l>
     <l n="210">For his cheek became , not pale , but fair ,</l>
     <l n="211">As rose-o'ershadowed lilies are ; 820</l>
     <l n="212">And soon his deep and sunny hair ,</l>
     <l n="213">In this alone less beautiful ,</l>
     <l n="214">Like grass in tombs grew wild and rare .</l>
     <l n="215">The blood in his translucent veins</l>
     <l n="216">Beat , not like animal life , but love 825</l>
     <l n="217">Seemed now its sullen springs to move ,</l>
     <l n="218">When life had failed , and all its pains :</l>
     <l n="219">And sudden sleep would seize him oft</l>
     <l n="220">Like death , so calm , but that a tear ,</l>
     <l n="221">His pointed eyelashes between , 830</l>
     <l n="222">Would gather in the light serene</l>
     <l n="223">Of smiles , whose lustre bright and soft</l>
     <l n="224">Beneath lay undulating there .</l>
     <l n="225">His breath was like inconstant flame ,</l>
     <l n="226">As eagerly it went and came ; 835</l>
     <l n="227">And I hung o'er him in his sleep ,</l>
     <l n="228">Till , like an image in the lake</l>
     <l n="229">Which rains disturb , my tears would break</l>
     <l n="230">The shadow of that slumber deep :</l>
     <l n="231">Then he would bid me not to weep , 840</l>
     <l n="232">And say , with flattery false , yet sweet ,</l>
     <l n="233">That death and he could never meet ,</l>
     <l n="234">If I would never part with him .</l>
     <l n="235">And so we loved , and did unite</l>
     <l n="236">All that in us was yet divided : 845</l>
     <l n="237">For when he said , that many a rite ,</l>
     <l n="238">By men to bind but once provided ,</l>
     <l n="239">Could not be shared by him and me ,</l>
     <l n="240">Or they would kill him in their glee ,</l>
     <l n="241">I shuddered , and then laughing said — 850</l>
     <l n="242">‘ We will have rites our faith to bind ,</l>
     <l n="243">But our church shall be the starry night ,</l>
     <l n="244">Our altar the grassy earth outspread ,</l>

     <l n="351">The fresh green leaves of the hedgerow briar , 960</l>

     <l n="354">A liquid element , whereon</l>

     <l n="370">One soul of interwoven flame ,</l>
     <l n="371">A life in life , a second birth 980</l>
     <l n="372">In worlds diviner far than earth ,</l>

     <l n="395">Death is dark , and foul , and dull ,</l>
     <l n="396">But he is — O how beautiful ! 1005</l>
     <l n="397">Yet day by day he grew more weak ,</l>
     <l n="398">And his sweet voice , when he might speak ,</l>
     <l n="399">Which ne'er was loud , became more low ;</l>
     <l n="400">And the light which flashed through his waxen cheek</l>
     <l n="401">Grew faint , as the rose-like hues which flow 1010</l>
     <l n="402">From sunset o'er the Alpine snow :</l>
     <l n="403">And death seemed not like death in him ,</l>
     <l n="404">For the spirit of life o'er every limb</l>
     <l n="405">Lingered , a mist of sense and thought .</l>
     <l n="406">When the summer wind faint odours brought 1015</l>
     <l n="407">From mountain flowers , even as it passed</l>
     <l n="408">His cheek would change , as the noonday sea</l>
     <l n="409">Which the dying breeze sweeps fitfully .</l>
     <l n="410">If but a cloud the sky o'ercast ,</l>
     <l n="411">You might see his colour come and go , 1020</l>
     <l n="412">And the softest strain of music made</l>
     <l n="413">Sweet smiles , yet sad , arise and fade</l>
     <l n="414">Amid the dew of his tender eyes ;</l>
     <l n="415">And the breath , with intermitting flow ,</l>
     <l n="416">Made his pale lips quiver and part . 1025</l>
     <l n="417">You might hear the beatings of his heart ,</l>
     <l n="418">Quick , but not strong ; and with my tresses</l>
     <l n="419">When oft he playfully would bind</l>
     <l n="420">In the bowers of mossy lonelinesses</l>
     <l n="421">His neck , and win me so to mingle 1030</l>
     <l n="422">In the sweet depth of woven caresses ,</l>
     <l n="423">And our faint limbs were intertwined ,</l>
     <l n="424">Alas ! the unquiet life did tingle</l>
     <l n="425">From mine own heart through every vein ,</l>
     <l n="426">Like a captive in dreams of liberty , 1035</l>
     <l n="427">Who beats the walls of his stony cell .</l>

     <l n="429">Like the shadow of fire surrounding me !</l>
     <l n="430">On my faint eyes and limbs did dwell</l>
     <l n="431">That spirit as it passed , till soon , 1040</l>
     <l n="432">As a frail cloud wandering o'er the moon ,</l>

     <l n="435">To alight on midnight 's dusky plain ,</l>

     <l n="503">We sate within that temple lone ,</l>
     <l n="504">Pavilioned round with Parian stone :</l>
     <l n="505">His mother 's harp stood near , and oft</l>
     <l n="506">I had awakened music soft 1115</l>
     <l n="507">Amid its wires : the nightingale</l>
     <l n="508">Was pausing in her heaven-taught tale :</l>
     <l n="509">‘ Now drain the cup , ’ said Lionel ,</l>
     <l n="510">‘ Which the poet-bird has crowned so well</l>
     <l n="511">With the wine of her bright and liquid song ! 1120</l>
     <l n="512">Heardst thou not sweet words among</l>
     <l n="513">That heaven-resounding minstrelsy ?</l>
     <l n="514">Heard'st thou not that those who die</l>
     <l n="515">Awake in a world of ecstasy ?</l>
     <l n="516">That love , when limbs are interwoven , 1125</l>
     <l n="517">And sleep , when the night of life is cloven ,</l>
     <l n="518">And thought , to the world 's dim boundaries clinging ,</l>
     <l n="519">And music , when one beloved is singing ,</l>
     <l n="520">Is death ? Let us drain right joyously</l>
     <l n="521">The cup which the sweet bird fills for me . ’ 1130</l>
     <l n="522">He paused , and to my lips he bent</l>
     <l n="523">His own : like spirit his words went</l>
     <l n="524">Through all my limbs with the speed of fire ;</l>
     <l n="525">And his keen eyes , glittering through mine ,</l>
     <l n="526">Filled me with the flame divine , 1135</l>
     <l n="527">Which in their orbs was burning far ,</l>
     <l n="528">Like the light of an unmeasured star ,</l>
     <l n="529">In the sky of midnight dark and deep :</l>
     <l n="530">Yes , ‘ twas his soul that did inspire</l>
     <l n="531">Sounds , which my skill could ne'er awaken ; 1140</l>
     <l n="532">And first , I felt my fingers sweep</l>
     <l n="533">The harp , and a long quivering cry</l>
     <l n="534">Burst from my lips in symphony :</l>
     <l n="535">The dusk and solid air was shaken ,</l>
     <l n="536">As swift and swifter the notes came 1145</l>
     <l n="537">From my touch , that wandered like quick flame ,</l>
     <l n="538">And from my bosom , labouring</l>
     <l n="539">With some unutterable thing :</l>
     <l n="540">The awful sound of my own voice made</l>
     <l n="541">My faint lips tremble ; in some mood 1150</l>
     <l n="542">Of wordless thought Lionel stood</l>
     <l n="543">So pale , that even beside his cheek</l>
     <l n="544">The snowy column from its shade</l>
     <l n="545">Caught whiteness : yet his countenance ,</l>
     <l n="546">Raised upward , burned with radiance 1155</l>
     <l n="547">Of spirit-piercing joy , whose light ,</l>
     <l n="548">Like the moon struggling through the night</l>
     <l n="549">Of whirlwind-rifted clouds , did break</l>
     <l n="550">With beams that might not be confined .</l>
     <l n="551">I paused , but soon his gestures kindled 1160</l>
     <l n="552">New power , as by the moving wind</l>
     <l n="553">The waves are lifted , and my song</l>
     <l n="554">To low soft notes now changed and dwindled ,</l>
     <l n="555">And from the twinkling wires among ,</l>
     <l n="556">My languid fingers drew and flung 1165</l>
     <l n="557">Circles of life-dissolving sound ,</l>
     <l n="558">Yet faint ; in aery rings they bound</l>
     <l n="559">My Lionel , who , as every strain</l>
     <l n="560">Grew fainter but more sweet , his mien</l>
     <l n="561">Sunk with the sound relaxedly ; 1170</l>
     <l n="562">And slowly now he turned to me ,</l>
     <l n="563">As slowly faded from his face</l>
     <l n="564">That awful joy : with looks serene</l>
     <l n="565">He was soon drawn to my embrace ,</l>
     <l n="566">And my wild song then died away 1175</l>
     <l n="567">In murmurs : words I dare not say</l>
     <l n="568">We mixed , and on his lips mine fed</l>
     <l n="569">Till they methought felt still and cold :</l>
     <l n="570">‘ What is it with thee , love ? ’ I said :</l>
     <l n="571">No word , no look , no motion ! yes , 1180</l>
     <l n="572">There was a change , but spare to guess ,</l>
     <l n="573">Nor let that moment 's hope be told .</l>
     <l n="574">I looked , and knew that he was dead ,</l>
     <l n="575">And fell , as the eagle on the plain</l>
     <l n="576">Falls when life deserts her brain , 1185</l>
     <l n="577">And the mortal lightning is veiled again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="578">O that I were now dead ! but such</l>
     <l n="579">( Did they not , love , demand too much ,</l>
     <l n="580">Those dying murmurs ? ) he forbade .</l>
     <l n="581">O that I once again were mad ! 1190</l>
     <l n="582">And yet , dear Rosalind , not so ,</l>
     <l n="583">For I would live to share thy woe .</l>
     <l n="584">Sweet boy ! did I forget thee too ?</l>
     <l n="585">Alas , we know not what we do</l>
     <l n="586">When we speak words .</l>
     <l n="587">No memory more 1195</l>
     <l n="588">Is in my mind of that sea shore .</l>
     <l n="589">Madness came on me , and a troop</l>
     <l n="590">Of misty shapes did seem to sit</l>
     <l n="591">Beside me , on a vessel 's poop ,</l>
     <l n="592">And the clear north wind was driving it . 1200</l>
     <l n="593">Then I heard strange tongues , and saw strange flowers ,</l>
     <l n="594">And the stars methought grew unlike ours ,</l>
     <l n="595">And the azure sky and the stormless sea</l>
     <l n="596">Made me believe that I had died ,</l>
     <l n="597">And waked in a world , which was to me 1205</l>
     <l n="598">Drear hell , though heaven to all beside :</l>
     <l n="599">Then a dead sleep fell on my mind ,</l>
     <l n="600">Whilst animal life many long years</l>
     <l n="601">Had rescued from a chasm of tears ;</l>
     <l n="602">And when I woke , I wept to find 1210</l>
     <l n="603">That the same lady , bright and wise ,</l>
     <l n="604">With silver locks and quick brown eyes ,</l>
     <l n="605">The mother of my Lionel ,</l>
     <l n="606">Had tended me in my distress ,</l>
     <l n="607">And died some months before . Nor less 1215</l>
     <l n="608">Wonder , but far more peace and joy ,</l>
     <l n="609">Brought in that hour my lovely boy ;</l>
     <l n="610">For through that trance my soul had well</l>
     <l n="611">The impress of thy being kept ;</l>
     <l n="612">And if I waked , or if I slept , 1220</l>
     <l n="613">No doubt , though memory faithless be ,</l>
     <l n="614">Thy image ever dwelt on me ;</l>
     <l n="615">And thus , O Lionel , like thee</l>
     <l n="616">Is our sweet child . ‘ Tis sure most strange</l>
     <l n="617">I knew not of so great a change , 1225</l>
     <l n="618">As that which gave him birth , who now</l>
     <l n="619">Is all the solace of my woe .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="620">That Lionel great wealth had left</l>
     <l n="621">By will to me , and that of all</l>
     <l n="622">The ready lies of law bereft 1230</l>
     <l n="623">My child and me , might well befall .</l>
     <l n="624">But let me think not of the scorn ,</l>
     <l n="625">Which from the meanest I have borne ,</l>
     <l n="626">When , for my child 's beloved sake ,</l>
     <l n="627">I mixed with slaves , to vindicate 1235</l>
     <l n="628">The very laws themselves do make :</l>
     <l n="629">Let me not say scorn is my fate ,</l>
     <l n="630">Lest I be proud , suffering the same</l>
     <l n="631">With those who live in deathless fame .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="632">She ceased .— ‘ Lo , where red morning thro ’ the woods 1240</l>
     <l n="633">Is burning o'er the dew ; ’ said Rosalind .</l>
     <l n="634">And with these words they rose , and towards the flood</l>
     <l n="635">Of the blue lake , beneath the leaves now wind</l>
     <l n="636">With equal steps and fingers intertwined :</l>
     <l n="637">Thence to a lonely dwelling , where the shore 1245</l>
     <l n="638">Is shadowed with steep rocks , and cypresses</l>
     <l n="639">Cleave with their dark green cones the silent skies ,</l>
     <l n="640">And with their shadows the clear depths below ,</l>
     <l n="641">And where a little terrace from its bowers ,</l>
     <l n="642">Of blooming myrtle and faint lemon-flowers , 1250</l>
     <l n="643">Scatters its sense-dissolving fragrance o'er</l>
     <l n="644">The liquid marble of the windless lake ;</l>
     <l n="645">And where the aged forest 's limbs look hoar ,</l>
     <l n="646">Under the leaves which their green garments make ,</l>
     <l n="647">They come : ‘ Tis Helen 's home , and clean and white , 1255</l>
     <l n="648">Like one which tyrants spare on our own land</l>
     <l n="649">In some such solitude , its casements bright</l>
     <l n="650">Shone through their vine-leaves in the morning sun ,</l>
     <l n="651">And even within ‘ twas scarce like Italy .</l>
     <l n="652">And when she saw how all things there were planned , 1260</l>
     <l n="653">As in an English home , dim memory</l>
     <l n="654">Disturbed poor Rosalind : she stood as one</l>
     <l n="655">Whose mind is where his body cannot be ,</l>
     <l n="656">Till Helen led her where her child yet slept ,</l>
     <l n="657">And said , ‘ Observe , that brow was Lionel 's , 1265</l>
     <l n="658">Those lips were his , and so he ever kept</l>
     <l n="659">One arm in sleep , pillowing his head with it .</l>
     <l n="660">You cannot see his eyes — they are two wells</l>
     <l n="661">Of liquid love : let us not wake him yet . ’</l>
     <l n="662">But Rosalind could bear no more , and wept 1270</l>
     <l n="663">A shower of burning tears , which fell upon</l>
     <l n="664">His face , and so his opening lashes shone</l>
     <l n="665">With tears unlike his own , as he did leap</l>
     <l n="666">In sudden wonder from his innocent sleep .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="667">So Rosalind and Helen lived together 1275</l>
     <l n="668">Thenceforth , changed in all else , yet friends again ,</l>
     <l n="669">Such as they were , when o'er the mountain heather</l>
     <l n="670">They wandered in their youth , through sun and rain .</l>
     <l n="671">And after many years , for human things</l>
     <l n="672">Change even like the ocean and the wind , 1280</l>
     <l n="673">Her daughter was restored to Rosalind ,</l>
     <l n="674">And in their circle thence some visitings</l>
     <l n="675">Of joy ‘ mid their new calm would intervene :</l>
     <l n="676">A lovely child she was , of looks serene ,</l>
     <l n="677">And motions which o'er things indifferent shed 1285</l>
     <l n="678">The grace and gentleness from whence they came .</l>
     <l n="679">And Helen 's boy grew with her , and they fed</l>
     <l n="680">From the same flowers of thought , until each mind</l>
     <l n="681">Like springs which mingle in one flood became ,</l>
     <l n="682">And in their union soon their parents saw 1290</l>
     <l n="683">The shadow of the peace denied to them .</l>
     <l n="684">And Rosalind , for when the living stem</l>
     <l n="685">Is cankered in its heart , the tree must fall ,</l>
     <l n="686">Died ere her time ; and with deep grief and awe</l>
     <l n="687">The pale survivors followed her remains 1295</l>
     <l n="688">Beyond the region of dissolving rains ,</l>
     <l n="689">Up the cold mountain she was wont to call</l>
     <l n="690">Her tomb ; and on Chiavenna 's precipice</l>
     <l n="691">They raised a pyramid of lasting ice ,</l>
     <l n="692">Whose polished sides , ere day had yet begun , 1300</l>
     <l n="693">Caught the first glow of the unrisen sun ,</l>
     <l n="694">The last , when it had sunk ; and thro ’ the night</l>
     <l n="695">The charioteers of Arctos wheeled round</l>
     <l n="696">Its glittering point , as seen from Helen 's home ,</l>
     <l n="697">Whose sad inhabitants each year would come , 1305</l>
     <l n="698">With willing steps climbing that rugged height ,</l>
     <l n="699">And hang long locks of hair , and garlands bound</l>
     <l n="700">With amaranth flowers , which , in the clime 's despite ,</l>
     <l n="701">Filled the frore air with unaccustomed light :</l>
     <l n="702">Such flowers , as in the wintry memory bloom 1310</l>
     <l n="703">Of one friend left , adorned that frozen tomb .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="704">Helen , whose spirit was of softer mould ,</l>

    <head>NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY .</head>
    <head>“ Rosalind and Helen ” was begun at Marlow , and thrown aside — till I found it ; and , at my request , it was completed . Shelley had no care for any of his poems that did not emanate from the depths of his mind , and develop some high or abstruse truth . When he does touch on human life and the human heart , no pictures can be more faithful , more delicate , more subtle , or more pathetic . He never mentioned Love but he shed a grace borrowed from his own nature , that scarcely any other poet has bestowed on that passion . When he spoke of it as the law of life , which inasmuch as we rebel against we err and injure ourselves and others , he promulgated that which he considered an irrefragable truth . In his eyes it was the essence of our being , and all woe and pain arose from the war made against it by selfishness , or insensibility , or mistake . By reverting in his mind to this first principle , he discovered the source of many emotions , and could disclose the secrets of all hearts , and his delineations of passion and emotion touch the finest chords of our nature .</head>
     <l n="1">“ Rosalind and Helen ” was finished during the summer of 1818 , while we</l>
     <l n="2">were at the Baths of Lucca .</l>

   <p>JULIAN AND MADDALO .</p>
   <p>A CONVERSATION .</p>
   <note>Composed at Este after Shelley 's first visit to Venice , 1818 ( Autumn ) ; first published in the “ Posthumous Poems ” , London , 1824 ( edition Mrs. Shelley ) . Shelley 's original intention had been to print the poem in Leigh Hunt 's “ Examiner ” ; but he changed his mind and , on August 15 , 1819 , sent the manuscript to Hunt to be published anonymously by Ollier . This manuscript , found by Mr. Townshend Mayer , and by him placed in the hands of Mr. H. Buxton Forman , C. B ., is described at length in Mr. Forman 's Library Edition of the poems ( volume 3 page 107 ) . The date , ‘ May , 1819 , ’ affixed to “ Julian and Maddalo ” in the “ Posthumous Poems ” , 1824 , indicates the time when the text was finally revised by Shelley . Sources of the text are ( 1 ) “ Posthumous Poems ” , 1824 ; ( 2 ) the Hunt manuscript ; ( 3 ) a fair draft of the poem amongst the Boscombe manuscripts ; ( 4 ) “ Poetical Works ” , 1839 , 1st and 2nd editions ( Mrs. Shelley ) . Our text is that of the Hunt manuscript , as printed in Forman 's Library Edition of the Poems , 1876 , volume 3 , pages 103-30 ; variants of 1824 are indicated in the footnotes ; questions of punctuation are dealt with in the notes at the end of the volume .</note>

    <head>PREFACE .</head>
     <l n="1">The meadows with fresh streams , the bees with thyme ,</l>
     <l n="2">The goats with the green leaves of budding Spring ,</l>
     <l n="3">Are saturated not — nor Love with tears .— VIRGIL 'S “ Gallus ” .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Count Maddalo is a Venetian nobleman of ancient family and of great fortune , who , without mixing much in the society of his countrymen , resides chiefly at his magnificent palace in that city . He is a person of the most consummate genius , and capable , if he would direct his energies to such an end , of becoming the redeemer of his degraded country . But it is his weakness to be proud : he derives , from a comparison of his own extraordinary mind with the dwarfish intellects that surround him , an intense apprehension of the nothingness of human life . His passions and his powers are incomparably greater than those of other men ; and , instead of the latter having been employed in curbing the former , they have mutually lent each other strength . His ambition preys upon itself , for want of objects which it can consider worthy of exertion . I say that Maddalo is proud , because I can find no other word to express the concentred and impatient feelings which consume him ; but it is on his own hopes and affections only that he seems to trample , for in social life no human being can be more gentle , patient and unassuming than Maddalo . He is cheerful , frank and witty . His more serious conversation is a sort of intoxication ; men are held by it as by a spell . He has travelled much ; and there is an inexpressible charm in his relation of his adventures in different countries .</p>
   <p>Julian is an Englishman of good family , passionately attached to those philosophical notions which assert the power of man over his own mind , and the immense improvements of which , by the extinction of certain moral superstitions , human society may be yet susceptible . Without concealing the evil in the world he is for ever speculating how good may be made superior . He is a complete infidel , and a scoffer at all things reputed holy ; and Maddalo takes a wicked pleasure in drawing out his taunts against religion . What Maddalo thinks on these matters is not exactly known . Julian , in spite of his heterodox opinions , is conjectured by his friends to possess some good qualities . How far this is possible the pious reader will determine . Julian is rather serious .</p>
   <p>Of the Maniac I can give no information . He seems , by his own account , to have been disappointed in love . He was evidently a very cultivated and amiable person when in his right senses . His story , told at length , might be like many other stories of the same kind : the unconnected exclamations of his agony will perhaps be found a sufficient comment for the text of every heart .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I rode one evening with Count Maddalo</l>
     <l n="2">Upon the bank of land which breaks the flow</l>
     <l n="3">Of Adria towards Venice : a bare strand</l>
     <l n="4">Of hillocks , heaped from ever-shifting sand ,</l>
     <l n="5">Matted with thistles and amphibious weeds , 5</l>
     <l n="6">Such as from earth 's embrace the salt ooze breeds ,</l>
     <l n="7">Is this ; an uninhabited sea-side ,</l>
     <l n="8">Which the lone fisher , when his nets are dried ,</l>
     <l n="9">Abandons ; and no other object breaks</l>
     <l n="10">The waste , but one dwarf tree and some few stakes 10</l>
     <l n="11">Broken and unrepaired , and the tide makes</l>
     <l n="12">A narrow space of level sand thereon ,</l>
     <l n="13">Where ‘ twas our wont to ride while day went down .</l>
     <l n="14">This ride was my delight . I love all waste</l>
     <l n="15">And solitary places ; where we taste 15</l>
     <l n="16">The pleasure of believing what we see</l>
     <l n="17">Is boundless , as we wish our souls to be :</l>
     <l n="18">And such was this wide ocean , and this shore</l>
     <l n="19">More barren than its billows ; and yet more</l>
     <l n="20">Than all , with a remembered friend I love 20</l>
     <l n="21">To ride as then I rode ;— for the winds drove</l>
     <l n="22">The living spray along the sunny air</l>
     <l n="23">Into our faces ; the blue heavens were bare ,</l>
     <l n="24">Stripped to their depths by the awakening north ;</l>
     <l n="25">And , from the waves , sound like delight broke forth 25</l>
     <l n="26">Harmonising with solitude , and sent</l>
     <l n="27">Into our hearts aereal merriment .</l>
     <l n="28">So , as we rode , we talked ; and the swift thought ,</l>
     <l n="29">Winging itself with laughter , lingered not ,</l>
     <l n="30">But flew from brain to brain ,— such glee was ours , 30</l>
     <l n="31">Charged with light memories of remembered hours ,</l>
     <l n="32">None slow enough for sadness : till we came</l>
     <l n="33">Homeward , which always makes the spirit tame .</l>
     <l n="34">This day had been cheerful but cold , and now</l>
     <l n="35">The sun was sinking , and the wind also . 35</l>
     <l n="36">Our talk grew somewhat serious , as may be</l>
     <l n="37">Talk interrupted with such raillery</l>
     <l n="38">As mocks itself , because it cannot scorn</l>
     <l n="39">The thoughts it would extinguish : — ‘ twas forlorn ,</l>
     <l n="40">Yet pleasing , such as once , so poets tell , 40</l>
     <l n="41">The devils held within the dales of Hell</l>
     <l n="42">Concerning God , freewill and destiny :</l>
     <l n="43">Of all that earth has been or yet may be ,</l>
     <l n="44">All that vain men imagine or believe ,</l>
     <l n="45">Or hope can paint or suffering may achieve , 45</l>
     <l n="46">We descanted ; and I ( for ever still</l>
     <l n="47">Is it not wise to make the best of ill ? )</l>
     <l n="48">Argued against despondency , but pride</l>
     <l n="49">Made my companion take the darker side .</l>
     <l n="50">The sense that he was greater than his kind 50</l>
     <l n="51">Had struck , methinks , his eagle spirit blind</l>
     <l n="52">By gazing on its own exceeding light .</l>
     <l n="53">Meanwhile the sun paused ere it should alight ,</l>
     <l n="54">Over the horizon of the mountains ;— Oh ,</l>
     <l n="55">How beautiful is sunset , when the glow 55</l>
     <l n="56">Of Heaven descends upon a land like thee ,</l>
     <l n="57">Thou Paradise of exiles , Italy !</l>
     <l n="58">Thy mountains , seas and vineyards , and the towers</l>
     <l n="59">Of cities they encircle !— it was ours</l>
     <l n="60">To stand on thee , beholding it : and then , 60</l>
     <l n="61">Just where we had dismounted , the Count 's men</l>
     <l n="62">Were waiting for us with the gondola .—</l>
     <l n="63">As those who pause on some delightful way</l>
     <l n="64">Though bent on pleasant pilgrimage , we stood</l>
     <l n="65">Looking upon the evening , and the flood 65</l>
     <l n="66">Which lay between the city and the shore ,</l>
     <l n="67">Paved with the image of the sky ... the hoar</l>
     <l n="68">And aery Alps towards the North appeared</l>
     <l n="69">Through mist , an heaven-sustaining bulwark reared</l>
     <l n="70">Between the East and West ; and half the sky 70</l>
     <l n="71">Was roofed with clouds of rich emblazonry</l>
     <l n="72">Dark purple at the zenith , which still grew</l>
     <l n="73">Down the steep West into a wondrous hue</l>
     <l n="74">Brighter than burning gold , even to the rent</l>
     <l n="75">Where the swift sun yet paused in his descent 75</l>
     <l n="76">Among the many-folded hills : they were</l>
     <l n="77">Those famous Euganean hills , which bear ,</l>
     <l n="78">As seen from Lido thro ’ the harbour piles ,</l>
     <l n="79">The likeness of a clump of peaked isles —</l>
     <l n="80">And then — as if the Earth and Sea had been 80</l>
     <l n="81">Dissolved into one lake of fire , were seen</l>
     <l n="82">Those mountains towering as from waves of flame</l>
     <l n="83">Around the vaporous sun , from which there came</l>
     <l n="84">The inmost purple spirit of light , and made</l>
     <l n="85">Their very peaks transparent . ‘ Ere it fade , ’ 85</l>
     <l n="86">Said my companion , ‘ I will show you soon</l>
     <l n="87">A better station ’ — so , o'er the lagune</l>
     <l n="88">We glided ; and from that funereal bark</l>
     <l n="89">I leaned , and saw the city , and could mark</l>
     <l n="90">How from their many isles , in evening 's gleam , 90</l>
     <l n="91">Its temples and its palaces did seem</l>
     <l n="92">Like fabrics of enchantment piled to Heaven .</l>
     <l n="93">I was about to speak , when — ‘ We are even</l>
     <l n="94">Now at the point I meant , ’ said Maddalo ,</l>
     <l n="95">And bade the gondolieri cease to row . 95</l>
     <l n="96">‘ Look , Julian , on the west , and listen well</l>
     <l n="97">If you hear not a deep and heavy bell . ’</l>
     <l n="98">I looked , and saw between us and the sun</l>
     <l n="99">A building on an island ; such a one</l>
     <l n="100">As age to age might add , for uses vile , 100</l>
     <l n="101">A windowless , deformed and dreary pile ;</l>
     <l n="102">And on the top an open tower , where hung</l>
     <l n="103">A bell , which in the radiance swayed and swung ;</l>
     <l n="104">We could just hear its hoarse and iron tongue :</l>
     <l n="105">The broad sun sunk behind it , and it tolled 105</l>
     <l n="106">In strong and black relief .— ‘ What we behold</l>
     <l n="107">Shall be the madhouse and its belfry tower , ’</l>
     <l n="108">Said Maddalo , ‘ and ever at this hour</l>
     <l n="109">Those who may cross the water , hear that bell</l>
     <l n="110">Which calls the maniacs , each one from his cell , 110</l>
     <l n="111">To vespers . ’ — ‘ As much skill as need to pray</l>
     <l n="112">In thanks or hope for their dark lot have they</l>
     <l n="113">To their stern maker , ’ I replied . ‘ O ho !</l>
     <l n="114">You talk as in years past , ’ said Maddalo .</l>
     <l n="115">‘'Tis strange men change not . You were ever still 115</l>
     <l n="116">Among Christ 's flock a perilous infidel ,</l>
     <l n="117">A wolf for the meek lambs — if you can n't swim</l>
     <l n="118">Beware of Providence . ’ I looked on him ,</l>
     <l n="119">But the gay smile had faded in his eye .</l>
     <l n="120">‘ And such , ’ — he cried , ‘ is our mortality , 120</l>
     <l n="121">And this must be the emblem and the sign</l>
     <l n="122">Of what should be eternal and divine !—</l>
     <l n="123">And like that black and dreary bell , the soul ,</l>
     <l n="124">Hung in a heaven-illumined tower , must toll</l>
     <l n="125">Our thoughts and our desires to meet below 125</l>
     <l n="126">Round the rent heart and pray — as madmen do</l>
     <l n="127">For what ? they know not ,— till the night of death</l>
     <l n="128">As sunset that strange vision , severeth</l>
     <l n="129">Our memory from itself , and us from all</l>
     <l n="130">We sought and yet were baffled . ’ I recall 130</l>
     <l n="131">The sense of what he said , although I mar</l>
     <l n="132">The force of his expressions . The broad star</l>
     <l n="133">Of day meanwhile had sunk behind the hill ,</l>
     <l n="134">And the black bell became invisible ,</l>
     <l n="135">And the red tower looked gray , and all between 135</l>
     <l n="136">The churches , ships and palaces were seen</l>
     <l n="137">Huddled in gloom ;— into the purple sea</l>
     <l n="138">The orange hues of heaven sunk silently .</l>
     <l n="139">We hardly spoke , and soon the gondola</l>
     <l n="140">Conveyed me to my lodging by the way . 140</l>
     <l n="141">The following morn was rainy , cold , and dim :</l>
     <l n="142">Ere Maddalo arose , I called on him ,</l>
     <l n="143">And whilst I waited with his child I played ;</l>
     <l n="144">A lovelier toy sweet Nature never made ;</l>
     <l n="145">A serious , subtle , wild , yet gentle being , 145</l>
     <l n="146">Graceful without design and unforeseeing ,</l>
     <l n="147">With eyes — Oh speak not of her eyes !— which seem</l>
     <l n="148">Twin mirrors of Italian Heaven , yet gleam</l>
     <l n="149">With such deep meaning , as we never see</l>
     <l n="150">But in the human countenance : with me 150</l>
     <l n="151">She was a special favourite : I had nursed</l>
     <l n="152">Her fine and feeble limbs when she came first</l>
     <l n="153">To this bleak world ; and she yet seemed to know</l>
     <l n="154">On second sight her ancient playfellow ,</l>
     <l n="155">Less changed than she was by six months or so ; 155</l>
     <l n="156">For after her first shyness was worn out</l>
     <l n="157">We sate there , rolling billiard balls about ,</l>
     <l n="158">When the Count entered . Salutations past —</l>
     <l n="159">‘ The word you spoke last night might well have cast</l>
     <l n="160">A darkness on my spirit — if man be 160</l>
     <l n="161">The passive thing you say , I should not see</l>
     <l n="162">Much harm in the religions and old saws</l>
     <l n="163">( Tho ’ I may never own such leaden laws )</l>
     <l n="164">Which break a teachless nature to the yoke :</l>
     <l n="165">Mine is another faith . ’ — thus much I spoke 165</l>
     <l n="166">And noting he replied not , added : ‘ See</l>
     <l n="167">This lovely child , blithe , innocent and free ;</l>
     <l n="168">She spends a happy time with little care ,</l>
     <l n="169">While we to such sick thoughts subjected are</l>
     <l n="170">As came on you last night . It is our will 170</l>
     <l n="171">That thus enchains us to permitted ill —</l>
     <l n="172">We might be otherwise — we might be all</l>
     <l n="173">We dream of happy , high , majestical .</l>
     <l n="174">Where is the love , beauty , and truth we seek ,</l>
     <l n="175">But in our mind ? and if we were not weak 175</l>
     <l n="176">Should we be less in deed than in desire ? ’</l>
     <l n="177">‘ Ay , if we were not weak — and we aspire</l>
     <l n="178">How vainly to be strong ! ’ said Maddalo :</l>
     <l n="179">‘ You talk Utopia . ’ ‘ It remains to know , ’</l>
     <l n="180">I then rejoined , ‘ and those who try may find 180</l>
     <l n="181">How strong the chains are which our spirit bind ;</l>
     <l n="182">Brittle perchance as straw ... We are assured</l>
     <l n="183">Much may be conquered , much may be endured ,</l>
     <l n="184">Of what degrades and crushes us . We know</l>
     <l n="185">That we have power over ourselves to do 185</l>
     <l n="186">And suffer — what , we know not till we try ;</l>
     <l n="187">But something nobler than to live and die —</l>
     <l n="188">So taught those kings of old philosophy</l>
     <l n="189">Who reigned , before Religion made men blind ;</l>
     <l n="190">And those who suffer with their suffering kind 190</l>
     <l n="191">Yet feel their faith , religion . ’ ‘ My dear friend , ’</l>
     <l n="192">Said Maddalo , ‘ my judgement will not bend</l>
     <l n="193">To your opinion , though I think you might</l>
     <l n="194">Make such a system refutation-tight</l>
     <l n="195">As far as words go . I knew one like you 195</l>
     <l n="196">Who to this city came some months ago ,</l>
     <l n="197">With whom I argued in this sort , and he</l>
     <l n="198">Is now gone mad ,— and so he answered me ,—</l>
     <l n="199">Poor fellow ! but if you would like to go ,</l>
     <l n="200">We 'll visit him , and his wild talk will show 200</l>
     <l n="201">How vain are such aspiring theories . ’</l>
     <l n="202">‘ I hope to prove the induction otherwise ,</l>
     <l n="203">And that a want of that true theory , still ,</l>
     <l n="204">Which seeks a “ soul of goodness ” in things ill</l>
     <l n="205">Or in himself or others , has thus bowed 205</l>
     <l n="206">His being — there are some by nature proud ,</l>
     <l n="207">Who patient in all else demand but this —</l>
     <l n="208">To love and be beloved with gentleness ;</l>
     <l n="209">And being scorned , what wonder if they die</l>
     <l n="210">Some living death ? this is not destiny 210</l>
     <l n="211">But man 's own wilful ill . ’</l>
     <l n="212">As thus I spoke</l>
     <l n="213">Servants announced the gondola , and we</l>
     <l n="214">Through the fast-falling rain and high-wrought sea</l>
     <l n="215">Sailed to the island where the madhouse stands .</l>
     <l n="216">We disembarked . The clap of tortured hands , 215</l>
     <l n="217">Fierce yells and howlings and lamentings keen ,</l>
     <l n="218">And laughter where complaint had merrier been ,</l>
     <l n="219">Moans , shrieks , and curses , and blaspheming prayers</l>
     <l n="220">Accosted us . We climbed the oozy stairs</l>
     <l n="221">Into an old courtyard . I heard on high , 220</l>
     <l n="222">Then , fragments of most touching melody ,</l>
     <l n="223">But looking up saw not the singer there —</l>
     <l n="224">Through the black bars in the tempestuous air</l>
     <l n="225">I saw , like weeds on a wrecked palace growing ,</l>
     <l n="226">Long tangled locks flung wildly forth , and flowing , 225</l>
     <l n="227">Of those who on a sudden were beguiled</l>
     <l n="228">Into strange silence , and looked forth and smiled</l>
     <l n="229">Hearing sweet sounds . Then I : ‘ Methinks there were</l>
     <l n="230">A cure of these with patience and kind care ,</l>
     <l n="231">If music can thus move ... but what is he 230</l>
     <l n="232">Whom we seek here ? ’ ‘ Of his sad history</l>
     <l n="233">I know but this , ’ said Maddalo : ‘ he came</l>
     <l n="234">To Venice a dejected man , and fame</l>
     <l n="235">Said he was wealthy , or he had been so ;</l>
     <l n="236">Some thought the loss of fortune wrought him woe ; 235</l>
     <l n="237">But he was ever talking in such sort</l>
     <l n="238">As you do — far more sadly — he seemed hurt ,</l>
     <l n="239">Even as a man with his peculiar wrong ,</l>
     <l n="240">To hear but of the oppression of the strong ,</l>
     <l n="241">Or those absurd deceits ( I think with you 240</l>
     <l n="242">In some respects , you know ) which carry through</l>
     <l n="243">The excellent impostors of this earth</l>
     <l n="244">When they outface detection — he had worth ,</l>
     <l n="245">Poor fellow ! but a humorist in his way ’ —</l>
     <l n="246">‘ Alas , what drove him mad ? ’ ‘ I cannot say : 245</l>
     <l n="247">A lady came with him from France , and when</l>
     <l n="248">She left him and returned , he wandered then</l>
     <l n="249">About yon lonely isles of desert sand</l>
     <l n="250">Till he grew wild — he had no cash or land</l>
     <l n="251">Remaining ,— the police had brought him here — 250</l>
     <l n="252">Some fancy took him and he would not bear</l>
     <l n="253">Removal ; so I fitted up for him</l>
     <l n="254">Those rooms beside the sea , to please his whim ,</l>
     <l n="255">And sent him busts and books and urns for flowers ,</l>
     <l n="256">Which had adorned his life in happier hours , 255</l>
     <l n="257">And instruments of music — you may guess</l>
     <l n="258">A stranger could do little more or less</l>
     <l n="259">For one so gentle and unfortunate :</l>
     <l n="260">And those are his sweet strains which charm the weight</l>
     <l n="261">From madmen 's chains , and make this Hell appear 260</l>
     <l n="262">A heaven of sacred silence , hushed to hear . ’ —</l>
     <l n="263">‘ Nay , this was kind of you — he had no claim ,</l>
     <l n="264">As the world says ’ — ‘ None — but the very same</l>
     <l n="265">Which I on all mankind were I as he</l>
     <l n="266">Fallen to such deep reverse ;— his melody 265</l>
     <l n="267">Is interrupted — now we hear the din</l>
     <l n="268">Of madmen , shriek on shriek , again begin ;</l>
     <l n="269">Let us now visit him ; after this strain</l>
     <l n="270">He ever communes with himself again ,</l>
     <l n="271">And sees nor hears not any . ’ Having said 270</l>
     <l n="272">These words , we called the keeper , and he led</l>
     <l n="273">To an apartment opening on the sea —</l>
     <l n="274">There the poor wretch was sitting mournfully</l>
     <l n="275">Near a piano , his pale fingers twined</l>
     <l n="276">One with the other , and the ooze and wind 275</l>
     <l n="277">Rushed through an open casement , and did sway</l>
     <l n="278">His hair , and starred it with the brackish spray ;</l>
     <l n="279">His head was leaning on a music book ,</l>
     <l n="280">And he was muttering , and his lean limbs shook ;</l>
     <l n="281">His lips were pressed against a folded leaf 280</l>
     <l n="282">In hue too beautiful for health , and grief</l>
     <l n="283">Smiled in their motions as they lay apart —</l>
     <l n="284">As one who wrought from his own fervid heart</l>
     <l n="285">The eloquence of passion , soon he raised</l>
     <l n="286">His sad meek face and eyes lustrous and glazed 285</l>
     <l n="287">And spoke — sometimes as one who wrote , and thought</l>
     <l n="288">His words might move some heart that heeded not ,</l>
     <l n="289">If sent to distant lands : and then as one</l>
     <l n="290">Reproaching deeds never to be undone</l>
     <l n="291">With wondering self-compassion ; then his speech 290</l>
     <l n="292">Was lost in grief , and then his words came each</l>
     <l n="293">Unmodulated , cold , expressionless ,—</l>
     <l n="294">But that from one jarred accent you might guess</l>
     <l n="295">It was despair made them so uniform :</l>
     <l n="296">And all the while the loud and gusty storm 295</l>
     <l n="297">Hissed through the window , and we stood behind</l>
     <l n="298">Stealing his accents from the envious wind</l>
     <l n="299">Unseen . I yet remember what he said</l>
     <l n="300">Distinctly : such impression his words made .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="301">‘ Month after month , ’ he cried , ‘ to bear this load 300</l>
     <l n="302">And as a jade urged by the whip and goad</l>
     <l n="303">To drag life on , which like a heavy chain</l>
     <l n="304">Lengthens behind with many a link of pain !—</l>
     <l n="305">And not to speak my grief — O , not to dare</l>
     <l n="306">To give a human voice to my despair , 305</l>
     <l n="307">But live , and move , and , wretched thing ! smile on</l>
     <l n="308">As if I never went aside to groan ,</l>
     <l n="309">And wear this mask of falsehood even to those</l>
     <l n="310">Who are most dear — not for my own repose —</l>
     <l n="311">Alas ! no scorn or pain or hate could be 310</l>
     <l n="312">So heavy as that falsehood is to me —</l>
     <l n="313">But that I cannot bear more altered faces</l>
     <l n="314">Than needs must be , more changed and cold embraces ,</l>

    <p n="1">NOTE BY MRS. SHELLEY .</p>
    <p n="2">From the Baths of Lucca , in 1818 , Shelley visited Venice ; and , circumstances rendering it eligible that we should remain a few weeks in the neighbourhood of that city , he accepted the offer of Lord Byron , who lent him the use of a villa he rented near Este ; and he sent for his family from Lucca to join him .</p>
    <p n="3">I Capuccini was a villa built on the site of a Capuchin convent , demolished when the French suppressed religious houses ; it was situated on the very overhanging brow of a low hill at the foot of a range of higher ones . The house was cheerful and pleasant ; a vine-trellised walk , a pergola , as it is called in Italian , led from the hall-door to a summer-house at the end of the garden , which Shelley made his study , and in which he began the “ Prometheus ” ; and here also , as he mentions in a letter , he wrote “ Julian and Maddalo ” . A slight ravine , with a road in its depth , divided the garden from the hill , on which stood the ruins of the ancient castle of Este , whose dark massive wall gave forth an echo , and from whose ruined crevices owls and bats flitted forth at night , as the crescent moon sunk behind the black and heavy battlements . We looked from the garden over the wide plain of Lombardy , bounded to the west by the far Apennines , while to the east the horizon was lost in misty distance . After the picturesque but limited view of mountain , ravine , and chestnut-wood , at the Baths of Lucca , there was something infinitely gratifying to the eye in the wide range of prospect commanded by our new abode .</p>
    <p n="4">Our first misfortune , of the kind from which we soon suffered even more severely , happened here . Our little girl , an infant in whose small features I fancied that I traced great resemblance to her father , showed symptoms of suffering from the heat of the climate . Teething increased her illness and danger . We were at Este , and when we became alarmed , hastened to Venice for the best advice . When we arrived at Fusina , we found that we had forgotten our passport , and the soldiers on duty attempted to prevent our crossing the laguna ; but they could not resist Shelley 's impetuosity at such a moment . We had scarcely arrived at Venice before life fled from the little sufferer , and we returned to Este to weep her loss .</p>
    <p n="5">After a few weeks spent in this retreat , which was interspersed by visits to Venice , we proceeded southward .</p>

    <p n="10">PREFACE .</p>
    <p n="11">The Greek tragic writers , in selecting as their subject any portion of their national history or mythology , employed in their treatment of it a certain arbitrary discretion . They by no means conceived themselves bound to adhere to the common interpretation or to imitate in story as in title their rivals and predecessors . Such a system would have amounted to a resignation of those claims to preference over their competitors which incited the composition . The Agamemnonian story was exhibited on the Athenian theatre with as many variations as dramas .</p>
    <p n="12">I have presumed to employ a similar license . The “ Prometheus Unbound ” of Aeschylus supposed the reconciliation of Jupiter with his victim as the price of the disclosure of the danger threatened to his empire by the consummation of his marriage with Thetis . Thetis , according to this view of the subject , was given in marriage to Peleus , and Prometheus , by the permission of Jupiter , delivered from his captivity by Hercules . Had I framed my story on this model , I should have done no more than have attempted to restore the lost drama of Aeschylus ; an ambition which , if my preference to this mode of treating the subject had incited me to cherish , the recollection of the high comparison such an attempt would challenge might well abate . But , in truth , I was averse from a catastrophe so feeble as that of reconciling the Champion with the Oppressor of mankind . The moral interest of the fable , which is so powerfully sustained by the sufferings and endurance of Prometheus , would be annihilated if we could conceive of him as unsaying his high language and quailing before his successful and perfidious adversary . The only imaginary being resembling in any degree Prometheus , is Satan ; and Prometheus is , in my judgement , a more poetical character than Satan , because , in addition to courage , and majesty , and firm and patient opposition to omnipotent force , he is susceptible of being described as exempt from the taints of ambition , envy , revenge , and a desire for personal aggrandisement , which , in the Hero of “ Paradise Lost ” , interfere with the interest . The character of Satan engenders in the mind a pernicious casuistry which leads us to weigh his faults with his wrongs , and to excuse the former because the latter exceed all measure . In the minds of those who consider that magnificent fiction with a religious feeling it engenders something worse . But Prometheus is , as it were , the type of the highest perfection of moral and intellectual nature , impelled by the purest and the truest motives to the best and noblest ends .</p>
    <p n="13">This Poem was chiefly written upon the mountainous ruins of the Baths of Caracalla , among the flowery glades , and thickets of odoriferous blossoming trees , which are extended in ever winding labyrinths upon its immense platforms and dizzy arches suspended in the air . The bright blue sky of Rome , and the effect of the vigorous awakening spring in that divinest climate , and the new life with which it drenches the spirits even to intoxication , were the inspiration of this drama .</p>
    <p n="14">The imagery which I have employed will be found , in many instances , to have been drawn from the operations of the human mind , or from those external actions by which they are expressed . This is unusual in modern poetry , although Dante and Shakespeare are full of instances of the same kind : Dante indeed more than any other poet , and with greater success . But the Greek poets , as writers to whom no resource of awakening the sympathy of their contemporaries was unknown , were in the habitual use of this power ; and it is the study of their works ( since a higher merit would probably be denied me ) to which I am willing that my readers should impute this singularity .</p>
    <p n="15">One word is due in candour to the degree in which the study of contemporary writings may have tinged my composition , for such has been a topic of censure with regard to poems far more popular , and indeed more deservedly popular , than mine . It is impossible that any one who inhabits the same age with such writers as those who stand in the foremost ranks of our own , can conscientiously assure himself that his language and tone of thought may not have been modified by the study of the productions of those extraordinary intellects . It is true , that , not the spirit of their genius , but the forms in which it has manifested itself , are due less to the peculiarities of their own minds than to the peculiarity of the moral and intellectual condition of the minds among which they have been produced . Thus a number of writers possess the form , whilst they want the spirit of those whom , it is alleged , they imitate ; because the former is the endowment of the age in which they live , and the latter must be the uncommunicated lightning of their own mind .</p>
    <p n="16">The peculiar style of intense and comprehensive imagery which distinguishes the modern literature of England has not been , as a general power , the product of the imitation of any particular writer . The mass of capabilities remains at every period materially the same ; the circumstances which awaken it to action perpetually change . If England were divided into forty republics , each equal in population and extent to Athens , there is no reason to suppose but that , under institutions not more perfect than those of Athens , each would produce philosophers and poets equal to those who ( if we except Shakespeare ) have never been surpassed . We owe the great writers of the golden age of our literature to that fervid awakening of the public mind which shook to dust the oldest and most oppressive form of the Christian religion . We owe Milton to the progress and development of the same spirit : the sacred Milton was , let it ever be remembered , a republican , and a bold inquirer into morals and religion . The great writers of our own age are , we have reason to suppose , the companions and forerunners of some unimagined change in our social condition or the opinions which cement it . The cloud of mind is discharging its collected lightning , and the equilibrium between institutions and opinions is now restoring , or is about to be restored .</p>
    <p n="17">As to imitation , poetry is a mimetic art . It creates , but it creates by combination and representation . Poetical abstractions are beautiful and new , not because the portions of which they are composed had no previous existence in the mind of man or in nature , but because the whole produced by their combination has some intelligible and beautiful analogy with those sources of emotion and thought , and with the contemporary condition of them : one great poet is a masterpiece of nature which another not only ought to study but must study . He might as wisely and as easily determine that his mind should no longer be the mirror of all that is lovely in the visible universe as exclude from his contemplation the beautiful which exists in the writings of a great contemporary . The pretence of doing it would be a presumption in any but the greatest ; the effect , even in him , would be strained , unnatural and ineffectual . A poet is the combined product of such internal powers as modify the nature of others ; and of such external influences as excite and sustain these powers ; he is not one , but both . Every man 's mind is , in this respect , modified by all the objects of nature and art ; by every word and every suggestion which he ever admitted to act upon his consciousness ; it is the mirror upon which all forms are reflected , and in which they compose one form . Poets , not otherwise than philosophers , painters , sculptors and musicians , are , in one sense , the creators , and , in another , the creations , of their age . From this subjection the loftiest do not escape . There is a similarity between Homer and Hesiod , between Aeschylus and Euripides , between Virgil and Horace , between Dante and Petrarch , between Shakespeare and Fletcher , between Dryden and Pope ; each has a generic resemblance under which their specific distinctions are arranged . If this similarity be the result of imitation , I am willing to confess that I have imitated .</p>
    <p n="18">Let this opportunity be conceded to me of acknowledging that I have , what a Scotch philosopher characteristically terms , ‘ a passion for reforming the world : ’ what passion incited him to write and publish his book , he omits to explain . For my part I had rather be damned with Plato and Lord Bacon , than go to Heaven with Paley and Malthus . But it is a mistake to suppose that I dedicate my poetical compositions solely to the direct enforcement of reform , or that I consider them in any degree as containing a reasoned system on the theory of human life . Didactic poetry is my abhorrence ; nothing can be equally well expressed in prose that is not tedious and supererogatory in verse . My purpose has hitherto been simply to familiarise the highly refined imagination of the more select classes of poetical readers with beautiful idealisms of moral excellence ; aware that until the mind can love , and admire , and trust , and hope , and endure , reasoned principles of moral conduct are seeds cast upon the highway of life which the unconscious passenger tramples into dust , although they would bear the harvest of his happiness . Should I live to accomplish what I purpose , that is , produce a systematical history of what appear to me to be the genuine elements of human society , let not the advocates of injustice and superstition flatter themselves that I should take Aeschylus rather than Plato as my model .</p>
    <p n="19">The having spoken of myself with unaffected freedom will need little apology with the candid ; and let the uncandid consider that they injure me less than their own hearts and minds by misrepresentation . Whatever talents a person may possess to amuse and instruct others , be they ever so inconsiderable , he is yet bound to exert them : if his attempt be ineffectual , let the punishment of an unaccomplished purpose have been sufficient ; let none trouble themselves to heap the dust of oblivion upon his efforts ; the pile they raise will betray his grave which might otherwise have been unknown .</p>

    <p n="23">SCENE : A RAVINE OF ICY ROCKS IN THE INDIAN CAUCASUS . PROMETHEUS IS DISCOVERED BOUND TO THE PRECIPICE . PANTEA AND IONE ARE SEATED AT HIS FEET . TIME , NIGHT . DURING , THE SCENE MORNING SLOWLY BREAKS .</p>
    <p n="24">PROMETHEUS : Monarch of Gods and DAEmons , and all Spirits But One , who throng those bright and rolling worlds Which Thou and I alone of living things Behold with sleepless eyes ! regard this Earth Made multitudinous with thy slaves , whom thou 5 Requitest for knee-worship , prayer , and praise , And toil , and hecatombs of broken hearts , With fear and self-contempt and barren hope . Whilst me , who am thy foe , eyeless in hate , Hast thou made reign and triumph , to thy scorn , 10 O'er mine own misery and thy vain revenge . Three thousand years of sleep-unsheltered hours , And moments aye divided by keen pangs Till they seemed years , torture and solitude , Scorn and despair ,— these are mine empire :— 15 More glorious far than that which thou surveyest From thine unenvied throne , O Mighty God ! Almighty , had I deigned to share the shame Of thine ill tyranny , and hung not here Nailed to this wall of eagle-baffling mountain , 20 Black , wintry , dead , unmeasured ; without herb , Insect , or beast , or shape or sound of life . Ah me ! alas , pain , pain ever , for ever !</p>
    <p n="25">No change , no pause , no hope ! Yet I endure . I ask the Earth , have not the mountains felt ? 25 I ask yon Heaven , the all-beholding Sun , Has it not seen ? The Sea , in storm or calm , Heaven 's ever-changing Shadow , spread below , Have its deaf waves not heard my agony ? Ah me ! alas , pain , pain ever , for ever ! 30</p>
    <p n="26">The crawling glaciers pierce me with the spears Of their moon-freezing crystals ; the bright chains Eat with their burning cold into my bones . Heaven 's winged hound , polluting from thy lips His beak in poison not his own , tears up 35 My heart ; and shapeless sights come wandering by , The ghastly people of the realm of dream , Mocking me : and the Earthquake-fiends are charged To wrench the rivets from my quivering wounds When the rocks split and close again behind : 40 While from their loud abysses howling throng The genii of the storm , urging the rage Of whirlwind , and afflict me with keen hail . And yet to me welcome is day and night , Whether one breaks the hoar-frost of the morn , 45 Or starry , dim , and slow , the other climbs The leaden-coloured east ; for then they lead The wingless , crawling hours , one among whom — As some dark Priest hales the reluctant victim — Shall drag thee , cruel King , to kiss the blood 50 From these pale feet , which then might trample thee If they disdained not such a prostrate slave . Disdain ! Ah , no ! I pity thee . What ruin Will hunt thee undefended through wide Heaven ! How will thy soul , cloven to its depth with terror , 55 Gape like a hell within ! I speak in grief , Not exultation , for I hate no more , As then ere misery made me wise . The curse Once breathed on thee I would recall . Ye Mountains , Whose many-voiced Echoes , through the mist 60 Of cataracts , flung the thunder of that spell ! Ye icy Springs , stagnant with wrinkling frost , Which vibrated to hear me , and then crept Shuddering through India ! Thou serenest Air , Through which the Sun walks burning without beams ! 65 And ye swift Whirlwinds , who on poised wings Hung mute and moveless o'er yon hushed abyss , As thunder , louder than your own , made rock The orbed world ! If then my words had power , Though I am changed so that aught evil wish 70 Is dead within ; although no memory be Of what is hate , let them not lose it now ! What was that curse ? for ye all heard me speak .</p>
    <p n="27">NOTE : 54 thro ’ wide B ; thro ’ the wide 1820 .</p>
    <p n="28">FIRST VOICE ( FROM THE MOUNTAINS ): Thrice three hundred thousand years O'er the Earthquake 's couch we stood : 75 Oft , as men convulsed with fears , We trembled in our multitude .</p>
    <p n="29">SECOND VOICE ( FROM THE SPRINGS ): Thunderbolts had parched our water , We had been stained with bitter blood , And had run mute , ‘ mid shrieks of slaughter , 80 Thro ’ a city and a solitude .</p>
    <p n="30">THIRD VOICE ( FROM THE AIR ): I had clothed , since Earth uprose , Its wastes in colours not their own , And oft had my serene repose Been cloven by many a rending groan . 85</p>
    <p n="31">FOURTH VOICE ( FROM THE WHIRLWINDS ): We had soared beneath these mountains Unresting ages ; nor had thunder , Nor yon volcano 's flaming fountains , Nor any power above or under Ever made us mute with wonder . 90</p>
    <p n="32">FIRST VOICE : But never bowed our snowy crest As at the voice of thine unrest .</p>
    <p n="33">SECOND VOICE : Never such a sound before To the Indian waves we bore . A pilot asleep on the howling sea 95 Leaped up from the deck in agony , And heard , and cried , ‘ Ah , woe is me ! ’ And died as mad as the wild waves be .</p>
    <p n="34">THIRD VOICE : By such dread words from Earth to Heaven My still realm was never riven : 100 When its wound was closed , there stood Darkness o'er the day like blood .</p>
    <p n="35">FOURTH VOICE : And we shrank back : for dreams of ruin To frozen caves our flight pursuing Made us keep silence — thus — and thus — 105 Though silence is a hell to us .</p>
    <p n="36">THE EARTH : The tongueless caverns of the craggy hills Cried , ‘ Misery ! ’ then ; the hollow Heaven replied , ‘ Misery ! ’ And the Ocean 's purple waves , Climbing the land , howled to the lashing winds , 110 And the pale nations heard it , ‘ Misery ! ’</p>
    <p n="37">NOTE : 106 as hell 1839 , B ; a hell 1820 .</p>
    <p n="38">PROMETHEUS : I hear a sound of voices : not the voice Which I gave forth . Mother , thy sons and thou Scorn him , without whose all-enduring will Beneath the fierce omnipotence of Jove , 115 Both they and thou had vanished , like thin mist Unrolled on the morning wind . Know ye not me , The Titan ? He who made his agony The barrier to your else all-conquering foe ? Oh , rock-embosomed lawns , and snow-fed streams , 120 Now seen athwart frore vapours , deep below , Through whose o'ershadowing woods I wandered once With Asia , drinking life from her loved eyes ; Why scorns the spirit which informs ye , now To commune with me ? me alone , who checked , 125 As one who checks a fiend-drawn charioteer , The falsehood and the force of him who reigns Supreme , and with the groans of pining slaves Fills your dim glens and liquid wildernesses : Why answer ye not , still ? Brethren !</p>
    <p n="39">THE EARTH : They dare not . 130</p>
    <p n="40">PROMETHEUS : Who dares ? for I would hear that curse again . Ha , what an awful whisper rises up ! ‘ Tis scarce like sound : it tingles through the frame As lightning tingles , hovering ere it strike . Speak , Spirit ! from thine inorganic voice 135 I only know that thou art moving near And love . How cursed I him ?</p>
    <p n="41">THE EARTH : How canst thou hear Who knowest not the language of the dead ?</p>
    <p n="42">PROMETHEUS : Thou art a living spirit ; speak as they .</p>
    <p n="43">THE EARTH : I dare not speak like life , lest Heaven 's fell King 140 Should hear , and link me to some wheel of pain More torturing than the one whereon I roll . Subtle thou art and good ; and though the Gods Hear not this voice , yet thou art more than God , Being wise and kind : earnestly hearken now . 145</p>
    <p n="44">PROMETHEUS : Obscurely through my brain , like shadows dim , Sweep awful thoughts , rapid and thick . I feel Faint , like one mingled in entwining love ; Yet ‘ tis not pleasure .</p>
    <p n="45">THE EARTH : No , thou canst not hear : Thou art immortal , and this tongue is known 150 Only to those who die .</p>
    <p n="46">PROMETHEUS : And what art thou , O , melancholy Voice ?</p>
    <p n="47">THE EARTH : I am the Earth , Thy mother ; she within whose stony veins , To the last fibre of the loftiest tree Whose thin leaves trembled in the frozen air , 155 Joy ran , as blood within a living frame , When thou didst from her bosom , like a cloud Of glory , arise , a spirit of keen joy ! And at thy voice her pining sons uplifted Their prostrate brows from the polluting dust , 160 And our almighty Tyrant with fierce dread Grew pale , until his thunder chained thee here . Then , see those million worlds which burn and roll Around us : their inhabitants beheld My sphered light wane in wide Heaven ; the sea 165 Was lifted by strange tempest , and new fire From earthquake-rifted mountains of bright snow Shook its portentous hair beneath Heaven 's frown ; Lightning and Inundation vexed the plains ; Blue thistles bloomed in cities ; foodless toads 170 Within voluptuous chambers panting crawled : When Plague had fallen on man , and beast , and worm , And Famine ; and black blight on herb and tree ; And in the corn , and vines , and meadow-grass , Teemed ineradicable poisonous weeds 175 Draining their growth , for my wan breast was dry With grief ; and the thin air , my breath , was stained With the contagion of a mother 's hate Breathed on her child 's destroyer ; ay , I heard Thy curse , the which , if thou rememberest not , 180 Yet my innumerable seas and streams , Mountains , and caves , and winds , and yon wide air , And the inarticulate people of the dead , Preserve , a treasured spell . We meditate In secret joy and hope those dreadful words , 185 But dare not speak them .</p>
    <p n="48">NOTE : 137 And love 1820 ; And lovest cj . Swinburne .</p>
    <p n="49">PROMETHEUS : Venerable mother ! All else who live and suffer take from thee Some comfort ; flowers , and fruits , and happy sounds , And love , though fleeting ; these may not be mine . But mine own words , I pray , deny me not . 190</p>
    <p n="50">THE EARTH : They shall be told . Ere Babylon was dust , The Magus Zoroaster , my dead child , Met his own image walking in the garden . That apparition , sole of men , he saw . For know there are two worlds of life and death : 195 One that which thou beholdest ; but the other Is underneath the grave , where do inhabit The shadows of all forms that think and live Till death unite them and they part no more ; Dreams and the light imaginings of men , 200 And all that faith creates or love desires , Terrible , strange , sublime and beauteous shapes . There thou art , and dost hang , a writhing shade , ‘ Mid whirlwind-peopled mountains ; all the gods Are there , and all the powers of nameless worlds , 205 Vast , sceptred phantoms ; heroes , men , and beasts ; And Demogorgon , a tremendous gloom ; And he , the supreme Tyrant , on his throne Of burning gold . Son , one of these shall utter The curse which all remember . Call at will 210 Thine own ghost , or the ghost of Jupiter , Hades or Typhon , or what mightier Gods From all-prolific Evil , since thy ruin , Have sprung , and trampled on my prostrate sons . Ask , and they must reply : so the revenge 215 Of the Supreme may sweep through vacant shades , As rainy wind through the abandoned gate Of a fallen palace .</p>
    <p n="51">PROMETHEUS : Mother , let not aught Of that which may be evil , pass again My lips , or those of aught resembling me . 220 Phantasm of Jupiter , arise , appear !</p>
    <p n="52">IONE : My wings are folded o'er mine ears : My wings are crossed o'er mine eyes : Yet through their silver shade appears , And through their lulling plumes arise , 225 A Shape , a throng of sounds ; May it be no ill to thee O thou of many wounds ! Near whom , for our sweet sister 's sake , Ever thus we watch and wake . 230</p>
    <p n="53">PANTHEA : The sound is of whirlwind underground , Earthquake , and fire , and mountains cloven ; The shape is awful like the sound , Clothed in dark purple , star-inwoven . A sceptre of pale gold 235 To stay steps proud , o'er the slow cloud His veined hand doth hold . Cruel he looks , but calm and strong , Like one who does , not suffers wrong .</p>
    <p n="54">PHANTASM OF JUPITER : Why have the secret powers of this strange world 240 Driven me , a frail and empty phantom , hither On direst storms ? What unaccustomed sounds Are hovering on my lips , unlike the voice With which our pallid race hold ghastly talk In darkness ? And , proud sufferer , who art thou ? 245</p>
    <p n="55">PROMETHEUS : Tremendous Image , as thou art must be He whom thou shadowest forth . I am his foe , The Titan . Speak the words which I would hear , Although no thought inform thine empty voice .</p>
    <p n="56">THE EARTH : Listen ! And though your echoes must be mute , 250 Grey mountains , and old woods , and haunted springs , Prophetic caves , and isle-surrounding streams , Rejoice to hear what yet ye cannot speak .</p>
    <p n="57">PHANTASM : A spirit seizes me and speaks within : It tears me as fire tears a thunder-cloud . 255</p>
    <p n="58">PANTHEA : See , how he lifts his mighty looks , the Heaven Darkens above .</p>
    <p n="59">IONE : He speaks ! O shelter me !</p>
    <p n="60">PROMETHEUS : I see the curse on gestures proud and cold , And looks of firm defiance , and calm hate , And such despair as mocks itself with smiles , 260 Written as on a scroll : yet speak ! Oh , speak !</p>
    <p n="61">PHANTASM : Fiend , I defy thee ! with a calm , fixed mind , All that thou canst inflict I bid thee do ; Foul Tyrant both of Gods and Humankind , One only being shalt thou not subdue . 265 Rain then thy plagues upon me here , Ghastly disease , and frenzying fear ; And let alternate frost and fire Eat into me , and be thine ire Lightning , and cutting hail , and legioned forms 270 Of furies , driving by upon the wounding storms .</p>
    <p n="62">Ay , do thy worst . Thou art omnipotent . O'er all things but thyself I gave thee power , And my own will . Be thy swift mischiefs sent To blast mankind , from yon ethereal tower . 275 Let thy malignant spirit move In darkness over those I love : On me and mine I imprecate The utmost torture of thy hate ; And thus devote to sleepless agony , 280 This undeclining head while thou must reign on high .</p>
    <p n="63">But thou , who art the God and Lord : O , thou , Who fillest with thy soul this world of woe , To whom all things of Earth and Heaven do bow In fear and worship : all-prevailing foe ! 285 I curse thee ! let a sufferer 's curse Clasp thee , his torturer , like remorse ; Till thine Infinity shall be A robe of envenomed agony ; And thine Omnipotence a crown of pain , 290 To cling like burning gold round thy dissolving brain .</p>
    <p n="64">Heap on thy soul , by virtue of this Curse , Ill deeds , then be thou damned , beholding good ; Both infinite as is the universe , And thou , and thy self-torturing solitude . 295 An awful image of calm power Though now thou sittest , let the hour Come , when thou must appear to be That which thou art internally ; And after many a false and fruitless crime 300 Scorn track thy lagging fall through boundless space and time .</p>
    <p n="65">PROMETHEUS : Were these my words , O Parent ?</p>
    <p n="66">THE EARTH : They were thine .</p>
    <p n="67">PROMETHEUS : It doth repent me : words are quick and vain ; Grief for awhile is blind , and so was mine . I wish no living thing to suffer pain . 305</p>
    <p n="68">THE EARTH : Misery , Oh misery to me , That Jove at length should vanquish thee . Wail , howl aloud , Land and Sea , The Earth 's rent heart shall answer ye . Howl , Spirits of the living and the dead , 310 Your refuge , your defence , lies fallen and vanquished .</p>
    <p n="69">FIRST ECHO : Lies fallen and vanquished !</p>
    <p n="70">SECOND ECHO : Fallen and vanquished !</p>
    <p n="71">IONE : Fear not : ‘ tis but some passing spasm , The Titan is unvanquished still . 315 But see , where through the azure chasm Of yon forked and snowy hill Trampling the slant winds on high With golden-sandalled feet , that glow Under plumes of purple dye , 320 Like rose-ensanguined ivory , A Shape comes now , Stretching on high from his right hand A serpent-cinctured wand .</p>
    <p n="72">PANTHEA : ‘ Tis Jove 's world-wandering herald , Mercury . 325</p>
    <p n="73">IONE : And who are those with hydra tresses And iron wings that climb the wind , Whom the frowning God represses Like vapours steaming up behind , Clanging loud , an endless crowd — 330</p>
    <p n="74">PANTHEA : These are Jove 's tempest-walking hounds , Whom he gluts with groans and blood , When charioted on sulphurous cloud He bursts Heaven 's bounds .</p>
    <p n="75">IONE : Are they now led , from the thin dead 335 On new pangs to be fed ?</p>
    <p n="76">PANTHEA : The Titan looks as ever , firm , not proud .</p>
    <p n="77">FIRST FURY : Ha ! I scent life !</p>
    <p n="78">SECOND FURY : Let me but look into his eyes !</p>
    <p n="79">THIRD FURY : The hope of torturing him smells like a heap Of corpses , to a death-bird after battle . 340</p>
    <p n="80">FIRST FURY : Darest thou delay , O Herald ! take cheer , Hounds Of Hell : what if the Son of Maia soon Should make us food and sport — who can please long The Omnipotent ?</p>
    <p n="81">MERCURY : Back to your towers of iron , And gnash , beside the streams of fire and wail , 345 Your foodless teeth . Geryon , arise ! and Gorgon , Chimaera , and thou Sphinx , subtlest of fiends Who ministered to Thebes Heaven 's poisoned wine , Unnatural love , and more unnatural hate : These shall perform your task .</p>
    <p n="82">FIRST FURY : Oh , mercy ! mercy ! 350 We die with our desire : drive us not back !</p>
    <p n="83">MERCURY : Crouch then in silence . Awful Sufferer ! To thee unwilling , most unwillingly I come , by the great Father 's will driven down , To execute a doom of new revenge . 355 Alas ! I pity thee , and hate myself That I can do no more : aye from thy sight Returning , for a season , Heaven seems Hell , So thy worn form pursues me night and day , Smiling reproach . Wise art thou , firm and good , 360 But vainly wouldst stand forth alone in strife Against the Omnipotent ; as yon clear lamps That measure and divide the weary years From which there is no refuge , long have taught And long must teach . Even now thy Torturer arms 365 With the strange might of unimagined pains The powers who scheme slow agonies in Hell , And my commission is to lead them here , Or what more subtle , foul , or savage fiends People the abyss , and leave them to their task . 370 Be it not so ! there is a secret known To thee , and to none else of living things , Which may transfer the sceptre of wide Heaven , The fear of which perplexes the Supreme : Clothe it in words , and bid it clasp his throne 375 In intercession ; bend thy soul in prayer , And like a suppliant in some gorgeous fane , Let the will kneel within thy haughty heart : For benefits and meek submission tame The fiercest and the mightiest .</p>
    <p n="84">PROMETHEUS : Evil minds 380 Change good to their own nature . I gave all He has ; and in return he chains me here Years , ages , night and day : whether the Sun Split my parched skin , or in the moony night The crystal-winged snow cling round my hair : 385 Whilst my beloved race is trampled down By his thought-executing ministers . Such is the tyrant 's recompense : ‘ tis just : He who is evil can receive no good ; And for a world bestowed , or a friend lost , 390 He can feel hate , fear , shame ; not gratitude : He but requites me for his own misdeed . Kindness to such is keen reproach , which breaks With bitter stings the light sleep of Revenge . Submission , thou dost know I cannot try : 395 For what submission but that fatal word , The death-seal of mankind 's captivity , Like the Sicilian 's hair-suspended sword , Which trembles o'er his crown , would he accept , Or could I yield ? Which yet I will not yield . 400 Let others flatter Crime , where it sits throned In brief Omnipotence : secure are they : For Justice , when triumphant , will weep down Pity , not punishment , on her own wrongs , Too much avenged by those who err . I wait , 405 Enduring thus , the retributive hour Which since we spake is even nearer now . But hark , the hell-hounds clamour : fear delay : Behold ! Heaven lowers under thy Father 's frown .</p>
    <p n="85">MERCURY : Oh , that we might be spared ; I to inflict 410 And thou to suffer ! Once more answer me : Thou knowest not the period of Jove 's power ?</p>
    <p n="86">PROMETHEUS : I know but this , that it must come .</p>
    <p n="87">MERCURY : Alas ! Thou canst not count thy years to come of pain ?</p>
    <p n="88">PROMETHEUS : They last while Jove must reign : nor more , nor less 415 Do I desire or fear .</p>
    <p n="89">MERCURY : Yet pause , and plunge Into Eternity , where recorded time , Even all that we imagine , age on age , Seems but a point , and the reluctant mind Flags wearily in its unending flight , 420 Till it sink , dizzy , blind , lost , shelterless ; Perchance it has not numbered the slow years Which thou must spend in torture , unreprieved ?</p>
    <p n="90">PROMETHEUS : Perchance no thought can count them , yet they pass .</p>
    <p n="91">MERCURY : If thou might'st dwell among the Gods the while Lapped in voluptuous joy ? 425</p>
    <p n="92">PROMETHEUS : I would not quit This bleak ravine , these unrepentant pains .</p>
    <p n="93">MERCURY : Alas ! I wonder at , yet pity thee .</p>
    <p n="94">PROMETHEUS : Pity the self-despising slaves of Heaven , Not me , within whose mind sits peace serene . 430 As light in the sun , throned : how vain is talk ! Call up the fiends .</p>
    <p n="95">IONE : O , sister , look ! White fire Has cloven to the roots yon huge snow-loaded cedar ; How fearfully God 's thunder howls behind !</p>
    <p n="96">MERCURY : I must obey his words and thine : alas ! 435 Most heavily remorse hangs at my heart !</p>
    <p n="97">PANTHEA : See where the child of Heaven , with winged feet , Runs down the slanted sunlight of the dawn .</p>
    <p n="98">IONE : Dear sister , close thy plumes over thine eyes Lest thou behold and die : they come : they come 440 Blackening the birth of day with countless wings , And hollow underneath , like death .</p>

    <p n="101">THIRD FURY : Champion of Heaven 's slaves !</p>
    <p n="102">PROMETHEUS : He whom some dreadful voice invokes is here , Prometheus , the chained Titan . Horrible forms , 445 What and who are ye ? Never yet there came Phantasms so foul through monster-teeming Hell From the all-miscreative brain of Jove ; Whilst I behold such execrable shapes , Methinks I grow like what I contemplate , 450 And laugh and stare in loathsome sympathy .</p>
    <p n="103">FIRST FURY : We are the ministers of pain , and fear , And disappointment , and mistrust , and hate , And clinging crime ; and as lean dogs pursue Through wood and lake some struck and sobbing fawn , 455 We track all things that weep , and bleed , and live , When the great King betrays them to our will .</p>
    <p n="104">PROMETHEUS : Oh ! many fearful natures in one name , I know ye ; and these lakes and echoes know The darkness and the clangour of your wings . 460 But why more hideous than your loathed selves Gather ye up in legions from the deep ?</p>

    <p n="106">PROMETHEUS : Can aught exult in its deformity ?</p>
    <p n="107">SECOND FURY : The beauty of delight makes lovers glad , 465 Gazing on one another : so are we . As from the rose which the pale priestess kneels To gather for her festal crown of flowers The aereal crimson falls , flushing her cheek , So from our victim 's destined agony 470 The shade which is our form invests us round , Else we are shapeless as our mother Night .</p>
    <p n="108">PROMETHEUS : I laugh your power , and his who sent you here , To lowest scorn . Pour forth the cup of pain .</p>
    <p n="109">FIRST FURY : Thou thinkest we will rend thee bone from bone , 475 And nerve from nerve , working like fire within ?</p>
    <p n="110">PROMETHEUS : Pain is my element , as hate is thine ; Ye rend me now ; I care not .</p>
    <p n="111">SECOND FURY : Dost imagine We will but laugh into thy lidless eyes ?</p>
    <p n="112">PROMETHEUS : I weigh not what ye do , but what ye suffer , 480 Being evil . Cruel was the power which called You , or aught else so wretched , into light .</p>
    <p n="113">THIRD FURY : Thou think'st we will live through thee , one by one , Like animal life , and though we can obscure not The soul which burns within , that we will dwell 485 Beside it , like a vain loud multitude Vexing the self-content of wisest men : That we will be dread thought beneath thy brain , And foul desire round thine astonished heart , And blood within thy labyrinthine veins 490 Crawling like agony ?</p>
    <p n="114">PROMETHEUS : Why , ye are thus now ; Yet am I king over myself , and rule The torturing and conflicting throngs within , As Jove rules you when Hell grows mutinous .</p>
    <p n="115">CHORUS OF FURIES : From the ends of the earth , from the ends of the earth , 495 Where the night has its grave and the morning its birth , Come , come , come ! Oh , ye who shake hills with the scream of your mirth , When cities sink howling in ruin ; and ye Who with wingless footsteps trample the sea , 500 And close upon Shipwreck and Famine 's track , Sit chattering with joy on the foodless wreck ; Come , come , come ! Leave the bed , low , cold , and red , Strewed beneath a nation dead ; 505 Leave the hatred , as in ashes Fire is left for future burning : It will burst in bloodier flashes When ye stir it , soon returning : Leave the self-contempt implanted 510 In young spirits , sense-enchanted , Misery 's yet unkindled fuel : Leave Hell 's secrets half unchanted To the maniac dreamer ; cruel More than ye can be with hate 515 Is he with fear . Come , come , come ! We are steaming up from Hell 's wide gate And we burthen the blast of the atmosphere , But vainly we toil till ye come here . 520</p>
    <p n="116">IONE : Sister , I hear the thunder of new wings .</p>

Dost thou boast the clear knowledge thou waken'dst for man ? Then was kindled within him a thirst which outran Those perishing waters ; a thirst of fierce fever , Hope , love , doubt , desire , which consume him for ever . 545 One came forth of gentle worth Smiling on the sanguine earth ; His words outlived him , like swift poison Withering up truth , peace , and pity . Look ! where round the wide horizon 550 Many a million-peopled city Vomits smoke in the bright air . Mark that outcry of despair ! ‘ Tis his mild and gentle ghost Wailing for the faith he kindled : 555 Look again , the flames almost To a glow-worm 's lamp have dwindled : The survivors round the embers Gather in dread . Joy , joy , joy ! 560 Past ages crowd on thee , but each one remembers , And the future is dark , and the present is spread Like a pillow of thorns for thy slumberless head .</p>

    <p n="132">PANTHEA : Alas ! I looked forth twice , but will no more .</p>
    <p n="133">IONE : What didst thou see ?</p>
    <p n="134">PANTHEA : A woful sight : a youth With patient looks nailed to a crucifix . 585</p>
    <p n="135">IONE : What next ?</p>
    <p n="136">PANTHEA : The heaven around , the earth below Was peopled with thick shapes of human death , All horrible , and wrought by human hands , And some appeared the work of human hearts , For men were slowly killed by frowns and smiles : 590 And other sights too foul to speak and live Were wandering by . Let us not tempt worse fear By looking forth : those groans are grief enough .</p>

    <p n="139">PROMETHEUS : Remit the anguish of that lighted stare ; Close those wan lips ; let that thorn-wounded brow Stream not with blood ; it mingles with thy tears ! Fix , fix those tortured orbs in peace and death , 600 So thy sick throes shake not that crucifix , So those pale fingers play not with thy gore . O , horrible ! Thy name I will not speak , It hath become a curse . I see , I see The wise , the mild , the lofty , and the just , 605 Whom thy slaves hate for being like to thee , Some hunted by foul lies from their heart 's home , An early-chosen , late-lamented home ; As hooded ounces cling to the driven hind ; Some linked to corpses in unwholesome cells : 610 Some — Hear I not the multitude laugh loud ?— Impaled in lingering fire : and mighty realms Float by my feet , like sea-uprooted isles , Whose sons are kneaded down in common blood By the red light of their own burning homes . 615</p>

The wise want love ; and those who love want wisdom ; And all best things are thus confused to ill . Many are strong and rich , and would be just , But live among their suffering fellow-men 630 As if none felt : they know not what they do .</p>

Peace is in the grave . The grave hides all things beautiful and good : I am a God and cannot find it there , 640 Nor would I seek it : for , though dread revenge , This is defeat , fierce king , not victory . The sights with which thou torturest gird my soul With new endurance , till the hour arrives When they shall be no types of things which are . 645</p>

    <p n="149">PROMETHEUS : There are two woes : To speak , and to behold ; thou spare me one . Names are there , Nature 's sacred watchwords , they Were borne aloft in bright emblazonry ; The nations thronged around , and cried aloud , 650 As with one voice , Truth , liberty , and love ! Suddenly fierce confusion fell from heaven Among them : there was strife , deceit , and fear : Tyrants rushed in , and did divide the spoil . This was the shadow of the truth I saw . 655</p>

To cheer thy state I bid ascend those subtle and fair spirits , Whose homes are the dim caves of human thought , And who inhabit , as birds wing the wind , 660 Its world-surrounding aether : they behold Beyond that twilight realm , as in a glass , The future : may they speak comfort to thee !</p>
    <p n="151">PANTHEA : Look , sister , where a troop of spirits gather , Like flocks of clouds in spring 's delightful weather , 665 Thronging in the blue air !</p>

    <p n="154">CHORUS OF SPIRITS : From unremembered ages we Gentle guides and guardians be Of heaven-oppressed mortality ; And we breathe , and sicken not , 675 The atmosphere of human thought : Be it dim , and dank , and gray , Like a storm-extinguished day , Travelled o'er by dying gleams ; Be it bright as all between 680 Cloudless skies and windless streams , Silent , liquid , and serene ; As the birds within the wind , As the fish within the wave , As the thoughts of man 's own mind 685 Float through all above the grave ; We make there our liquid lair , Voyaging cloudlike and unpent Through the boundless element : Thence we bear the prophecy 690 Which begins and ends in thee !</p>

    <p n="157">FIRST SPIRIT : On a battle-trumpet 's blast I fled hither , fast , fast , fast , 695 ‘ Mid the darkness upward cast . From the dust of creeds outworn , From the tyrant 's banner torn , Gathering ‘ round me , onward borne , There was mingled many a cry — 700 Freedom ! Hope ! Death ! Victory ! Till they faded through the sky ; And one sound , above , around , One sound beneath , around , above , Was moving ; ‘ twas the soul of Love ; 705 ‘ Twas the hope , the prophecy , Which begins and ends in thee .</p>
    <p n="158">SECOND SPIRIT : A rainbow 's arch stood on the sea , Which rocked beneath , immovably ; And the triumphant storm did flee , 710 Like a conqueror , swift and proud , Between , with many a captive cloud , A shapeless , dark and rapid crowd , Each by lightning riven in half : I heard the thunder hoarsely laugh : 715 Mighty fleets were strewn like chaff And spread beneath a hell of death O'er the white waters . I alit On a great ship lightning-split , And speeded hither on the sigh 720 Of one who gave an enemy His plank , then plunged aside to die .</p>
    <p n="159">THIRD SPIRIT : I sate beside a sage 's bed , And the lamp was burning red Near the book where he had fed , 725 When a Dream with plumes of flame , To his pillow hovering came , And I knew it was the same Which had kindled long ago Pity , eloquence , and woe ; 730 And the world awhile below Wore the shade , its lustre made . It has borne me here as fleet As Desire 's lightning feet : I must ride it back ere morrow , 735 Or the sage will wake in sorrow .</p>
    <p n="160">FOURTH SPIRIT : On a poet 's lips I slept Dreaming like a love-adept In the sound his breathing kept ; Nor seeks nor finds he mortal blisses , 740 But feeds on the aereal kisses Of shapes that haunt thought 's wildernesses . He will watch from dawn to gloom The lake-reflected sun illume The yellow bees in the ivy-bloom , 745 Nor heed nor see , what things they be ; But from these create he can Forms more real than living man , Nurslings of immortality ! One of these awakened me , 750 And I sped to succour thee .</p>
    <p n="161">IONE : Behold'st thou not two shapes from the east and west Come , as two doves to one beloved nest , Twin nurslings of the all-sustaining air On swift still wings glide down the atmosphere ? 755 And , hark ! their sweet sad voices ! ‘ tis despair Mingled with love and then dissolved in sound .</p>
    <p n="162">PANTHEA : Canst thou speak , sister ? all my words are drowned .</p>
    <p n="163">IONE : Their beauty gives me voice . See how they float On their sustaining wings of skiey grain , 760 Orange and azure deepening into gold : Their soft smiles light the air like a star 's fire .</p>
    <p n="164">CHORUS OF SPIRITS : Hast thou beheld the form of Love ?</p>
    <p n="165">FIFTH SPIRIT : As over wide dominions I sped , like some swift cloud that wings the wide air 's wildernesses , That planet-crested shape swept by on lightning-braided pinions , 765 Scattering the liquid joy of life from his ambrosial tresses : His footsteps paved the world with light ; but as I passed ‘ twas fading , And hollow Ruin yawned behind : great sages bound in madness , And headless patriots , and pale youths who perished , unupbraiding , Gleamed in the night . I wandered o'er , till thou , O King of sadness , 770 Turned by thy smile the worst I saw to recollected gladness .</p>
    <p n="166">SIXTH SPIRIT : Ah , sister ! Desolation is a delicate thing : It walks not on the earth , it floats not on the air , But treads with lulling footstep , and fans with silent wing The tender hopes which in their hearts the best and gentlest bear ; 775 Who , soothed to false repose by the fanning plumes above And the music-stirring motion of its soft and busy feet , Dream visions of aereal joy , and call the monster , Love , And wake , and find the shadow Pain , as he whom now we greet .</p>

    <p n="168">CHORUS : Though Ruin now Love 's shadow be , 780 Following him , destroyingly , On Death 's white and winged steed , Which the fleetest cannot flee , Trampling down both flower and weed , Man and beast , and foul and fair , 785 Like a tempest through the air ; Thou shalt quell this horseman grim , Woundless though in heart or limb .</p>
    <p n="169">PROMETHEUS : Spirits ! how know ye this shall be ?</p>
    <p n="170">CHORUS : In the atmosphere we breathe , 790 As buds grow red when the snow-storms flee , From Spring gathering up beneath , Whose mild winds shake the elder-brake , And the wandering herdsmen know That the white-thorn soon will blow : 795 Wisdom , Justice , Love , and Peace , When they struggle to increase , Are to us as soft winds be To shepherd boys , the prophecy Which begins and ends in thee . 800</p>
    <p n="171">IONE : Where are the Spirits fled ?</p>
    <p n="172">PANTHEA : Only a sense Remains of them , like the omnipotence Of music , when the inspired voice and lute Languish , ere yet the responses are mute , Which through the deep and labyrinthine soul , 805 Like echoes through long caverns , wind and roll .</p>
    <p n="173">PROMETHEUS : How fair these airborn shapes ! and yet I feel Most vain all hope but love ; and thou art far , Asia ! who , when my being overflowed , Wert like a golden chalice to bright wine 810 Which else had sunk into the thirsty dust . All things are still : alas ! how heavily This quiet morning weighs upon my heart ; Though I should dream I could even sleep with grief If slumber were denied not . I would fain 815 Be what it is my destiny to be , The saviour and the strength of suffering man , Or sink into the original gulf of things : There is no agony , and no solace left ; Earth can console , Heaven can torment no more . 820</p>
    <p n="174">PANTHEA : Hast thou forgotten one who watches thee The cold dark night , and never sleeps but when The shadow of thy spirit falls on her ?</p>
    <p n="175">PROMETHEUS : I said all hope was vain but love : thou lovest .</p>
    <p n="176">PANTHEA : Deeply in truth ; but the eastern star looks white , 825 And Asia waits in that far Indian vale , The scene of her sad exile ; rugged once And desolate and frozen , like this ravine ; But now invested with fair flowers and herbs , And haunted by sweet airs and sounds , which flow 830 Among the woods and waters , from the aether Of her transforming presence , which would fade If it were mingled not with thine . Farewell !</p>

    <p n="178">ACT 2 .</p>
    <p n="179">SCENE 2. 1 : MORNING . A LOVELY VALE IN THE INDIAN CAUCASUS . ASIA , ALONE .</p>
    <p n="180">ASIA : From all the blasts of heaven thou hast descended : Yes , like a spirit , like a thought , which makes Unwonted tears throng to the horny eyes , And beatings haunt the desolated heart , Which should have learnt repose : thou hast descended 5 Cradled in tempests ; thou dost wake , O Spring ! O child of many winds ! As suddenly Thou comest as the memory of a dream , Which now is sad because it hath been sweet ; Like genius , or like joy which riseth up 10 As from the earth , clothing with golden clouds The desert of our life . This is the season , this the day , the hour ; At sunrise thou shouldst come , sweet sister mine , Too long desired , too long delaying , come ! 15 How like death-worms the wingless moments crawl ! The point of one white star is quivering still Deep in the orange light of widening morn Beyond the purple mountains : through a chasm Of wind-divided mist the darker lake 20 Reflects it : now it wanes : it gleams again As the waves fade , and as the burning threads Of woven cloud unravel in pale air : ‘ Tis lost ! and through yon peaks of cloud-like snow The roseate sunlight quivers : hear I not 25 The Aeolian music of her sea-green plumes Winnowing the crimson dawn ?</p>
    <p n="181">PANTHEA [ ENTERS ]: I feel , I see Those eyes which burn through smiles that fade in tears , Like stars half quenched in mists of silver dew . Beloved and most beautiful , who wearest 30 The shadow of that soul by which I live , How late thou art ! the sphered sun had climbed The sea ; my heart was sick with hope , before The printless air felt thy belated plumes .</p>
    <p n="182">PANTHEA : Pardon , great Sister ! but my wings were faint 35 With the delight of a remembered dream , As are the noontide plumes of summer winds Satiate with sweet flowers . I was wont to sleep Peacefully , and awake refreshed and calm Before the sacred Titan 's fall , and thy 40 Unhappy love , had made , through use and pity , Both love and woe familiar to my heart As they had grown to thine : erewhile I slept Under the glaucous caverns of old Ocean Within dim bowers of green and purple moss , 45 Our young Ione 's soft and milky arms Locked then , as now , behind my dark , moist hair , While my shut eyes and cheek were pressed within The folded depth of her life-breathing bosom : But not as now , since I am made the wind 50 Which fails beneath the music that I bear Of thy most wordless converse ; since dissolved Into the sense with which love talks , my rest Was troubled and yet sweet ; my waking hours Too full of care and pain .</p>
    <p n="183">ASIA : Lift up thine eyes , 55 And let me read thy dream .</p>
    <p n="184">PANTHEA : As I have said With our sea-sister at his feet I slept . The mountain mists , condensing at our voice Under the moon , had spread their snowy flakes , From the keen ice shielding our linked sleep . 60 Then two dreams came . One , I remember not . But in the other his pale wound-worn limbs Fell from Prometheus , and the azure night Grew radiant with the glory of that form Which lives unchanged within , and his voice fell 65 Like music which makes giddy the dim brain , Faint with intoxication of keen joy : ‘ Sister of her whose footsteps pave the world With loveliness — more fair than aught but her , Whose shadow thou art — lift thine eyes on me . ’ 70 I lifted them : the overpowering light Of that immortal shape was shadowed o'er By love ; which , from his soft and flowing limbs , And passion-parted lips , and keen , faint eyes , Steamed forth like vaporous fire ; an atmosphere 75 Which wrapped me in its all-dissolving power , As the warm ether of the morning sun Wraps ere it drinks some cloud of wandering dew . I saw not , heard not , moved not , only felt His presence flow and mingle through my blood 80 Till it became his life , and his grew mine , And I was thus absorbed , until it passed , And like the vapours when the sun sinks down , Gathering again in drops upon the pines , And tremulous as they , in the deep night 85 My being was condensed ; and as the rays Of thought were slowly gathered , I could hear His voice , whose accents lingered ere they died Like footsteps of weak melody : thy name Among the many sounds alone I heard 90 Of what might be articulate ; though still I listened through the night when sound was none . Ione wakened then , and said to me : ‘ Canst thou divine what troubles me to-night ? I always knew , what I desired before , 95 Nor ever found delight to wish in vain . But now I cannot tell thee what I seek ; I know not ; something sweet , since it is sweet Even to desire ; it is thy sport , false sister ; Thou hast discovered some enchantment old , 100 Whose spells have stolen my spirit as I slept And mingled it with thine : for when just now We kissed , I felt within thy parted lips The sweet air that sustained me , and the warmth Of the life-blood , for loss of which I faint , 105 Quivered between our intertwining arms . ’ I answered not , for the Eastern star grew pale , But fled to thee .</p>
    <p n="185">ASIA : Thou speakest , but thy words Are as the air : I feel them not : Oh , lift Thine eyes , that I may read his written soul ! 110</p>
    <p n="186">PANTHEA : I lift them though they droop beneath the load Of that they would express : what canst thou see But thine own fairest shadow imaged there ?</p>
    <p n="187">ASIA : Thine eyes are like the deep , blue , boundless heaven Contracted to two circles underneath 115 Their long , fine lashes ; dark , far , measureless , Orb within orb , and line through line inwoven .</p>
    <p n="188">PANTHEA : Why lookest thou as if a spirit passed ?</p>
    <p n="189">ASIA : There is a change : beyond their inmost depth I see a shade , a shape : ‘ tis He , arrayed 120 In the soft light of his own smiles , which spread Like radiance from the cloud-surrounded moon . Prometheus , it is thine ! depart not yet ! Say not those smiles that we shall meet again Within that bright pavilion which their beams 125 Shall build o'er the waste world ? The dream is told . What shape is that between us ? Its rude hair Roughens the wind that lifts it , its regard Is wild and quick , yet ‘ tis a thing of air , For through its gray robe gleams the golden dew 130 Whose stars the noon has quenched not .</p>

    <p n="192">PANTHEA : It is mine other dream .</p>
    <p n="193">ASIA : It disappears .</p>
    <p n="194">PANTHEA : It passes now into my mind . Methought As we sate here , the flower-infolding buds Burst on yon lightning-blasted almond tree , 135 When swift from the white Scythian wilderness A wind swept forth wrinkling the Earth with frost : I looked , and all the blossoms were blown down ; But on each leaf was stamped , as the blue bells Of Hyacinth tell Apollo 's written grief , 140 O , FOLLOW , FOLLOW !</p>
    <p n="195">ASIA : As you speak , your words Fill , pause by pause , my own forgotten sleep With shapes . Methought among these lawns together We wandered , underneath the young gray dawn , And multitudes of dense white fleecy clouds 145 Were wandering in thick flocks along the mountains Shepherded by the slow , unwilling wind ; And the white dew on the new-bladed grass , Just piercing the dark earth , hung silently ; And there was more which I remember not : 150 But on the shadows of the morning clouds , Athwart the purple mountain slope , was written FOLLOW , O , FOLLOW ! as they vanished by ; And on each herb , from which Heaven 's dew had fallen , The like was stamped , as with a withering fire ; 155 A wind arose among the pines ; it shook The clinging music from their boughs , and then Low , sweet , faint sounds , like the farewell of ghosts , Were heard : O , FOLLOW , FOLLOW , FOLLOW ME ! And then I said , ‘ Panthea , look on me . ’ 160 But in the depth of those beloved eyes Still I saw , FOLLOW , FOLLOW !</p>
    <p n="196">NOTE : 143 these B ; the 1820 .</p>
    <p n="197">ECHO : Follow , follow !</p>
    <p n="198">PANTHEA : The crags , this clear spring morning , mock our voices As they were spirit-tongued .</p>
    <p n="199">ASIA : It is some being Around the crags . What fine clear sounds ! O , list ! 165</p>
    <p n="200">ECHOES , UNSEEN : Echoes we : listen ! We cannot stay : As dew-stars glisten Then fade away — Child of Ocean ! 170</p>
    <p n="201">ASIA : Hark ! Spirits speak . The liquid responses Of their aereal tongues yet sound .</p>
    <p n="202">PANTHEA : I hear .</p>
    <p n="203">ECHOES : Oh , follow , follow , As our voice recedeth Through the caverns hollow , 175 Where the forest spreadeth ; [ MORE DISTANT . ] Oh , follow , follow ! Through the caverns hollow , As the song floats thou pursue , Where the wild bee never flew , 180 Through the noontide darkness deep , By the odour-breathing sleep Of faint night-flowers , and the waves At the fountain-lighted caves , While our music , wild and sweet , 185 Mocks thy gently falling feet , Child of Ocean !</p>
    <p n="204">ASIA : Shall we pursue the sound ? It grows more faint And distant .</p>
    <p n="205">PANTHEA : List ! the strain floats nearer now .</p>
    <p n="206">ECHOES : In the world unknown 190 Sleeps a voice unspoken ; By thy step alone Can its rest be broken ; Child of Ocean !</p>
    <p n="207">ASIA : How the notes sink upon the ebbing wind ! 195</p>
    <p n="208">ECHOES : Oh , follow , follow ! Through the caverns hollow , As the song floats thou pursue , By the woodland noontide dew ; By the forests , lakes , and fountains , 200 Through the many-folded mountains ; To the rents , and gulfs , and chasms , Where the Earth reposed from spasms , On the day when He and thou Parted , to commingle now ; 205 Child of Ocean !</p>
    <p n="209">ASIA : Come , sweet Panthea , link thy hand in mine , And follow , ere the voices fade away .</p>
    <p n="210">SCENE 2. 2 : A FOREST , INTERMINGLED WITH ROCKS AND CAVERNS . ASIA AND PANTHEA PASS INTO IT . TWO YOUNG FAUNS ARE SITTING ON A ROCK LISTENING .</p>
    <p n="211">SEMICHORUS 1 OF SPIRITS : The path through which that lovely twain Have passed , by cedar , pine , and yew , And each dark tree that ever grew , Is curtained out from Heaven 's wide blue ; Nor sun , nor moon , nor wind , nor rain , 5 Can pierce its interwoven bowers , Nor aught , save where some cloud of dew , Drifted along the earth-creeping breeze , Between the trunks of the hoar trees , Hangs each a pearl in the pale flowers 10 Of the green laurel , blown anew , And bends , and then fades silently , One frail and fair anemone : Or when some star of many a one That climbs and wanders through steep night , 15 Has found the cleft through which alone Beams fall from high those depths upon Ere it is borne away , away , By the swift Heavens that cannot stay , It scatters drops of golden light , 20 Like lines of rain that ne'er unite : And the gloom divine is all around , And underneath is the mossy ground .</p>
    <p n="212">SEMICHORUS 2 : There the voluptuous nightingales , Are awake through all the broad noonday . 25 When one with bliss or sadness fails , And through the windless ivy-boughs , Sick with sweet love , droops dying away On its mate 's music-panting bosom ; Another from the swinging blossom , 30 Watching to catch the languid close Of the last strain , then lifts on high The wings of the weak melody , Till some new strain of feeling bear The song , and all the woods are mute ; 35 When there is heard through the dim air The rush of wings , and rising there Like many a lake-surrounded flute , Sounds overflow the listener 's brain So sweet , that joy is almost pain . 40</p>
    <p n="213">NOTE : 38 surrounded B , edition 1839 ; surrounding 1820 .</p>
    <p n="214">SEMICHORUS 1 : There those enchanted eddies play Of echoes , music-tongued , which draw , By Demogorgon 's mighty law , With melting rapture , or sweet awe , All spirits on that secret way ; 45 As inland boats are driven to Ocean Down streams made strong with mountain-thaw : And first there comes a gentle sound To those in talk or slumber bound , And wakes the destined soft emotion ,— 50 Attracts , impels them ; those who saw Say from the breathing earth behind There steams a plume-uplifting wind Which drives them on their path , while they Believe their own swift wings and feet 55 The sweet desires within obey : And so they float upon their way , Until , still sweet , but loud and strong , The storm of sound is driven along , Sucked up and hurrying : as they fleet 60 Behind , its gathering billows meet And to the fatal mountain bear Like clouds amid the yielding air .</p>
    <p n="215">NOTE : 50 destined ] destinied 1820 .</p>
    <p n="216">FIRST FAUN : Canst thou imagine where those spirits live Which make such delicate music in the woods ? 65 We haunt within the least frequented caves And closest coverts , and we know these wilds , Yet never meet them , though we hear them oft : Where may they hide themselves ?</p>
    <p n="217">SECOND FAUN : ‘ Tis hard to tell ; I have heard those more skilled in spirits say , 70 The bubbles , which the enchantment of the sun Sucks from the pale faint water-flowers that pave The oozy bottom of clear lakes and pools , Are the pavilions where such dwell and float Under the green and golden atmosphere 75 Which noontide kindles through the woven leaves ; And when these burst , and the thin fiery air , The which they breathed within those lucent domes , Ascends to flow like meteors through the night , They ride on them , and rein their headlong speed , 80 And bow their burning crests , and glide in fire Under the waters of the earth again .</p>
    <p n="218">FIRST FAUN : If such live thus , have others other lives , Under pink blossoms or within the bells Of meadow flowers , or folded violets deep , 85 Or on their dying odours , when they die , Or in the sunlight of the sphered dew ?</p>

    <p n="220">SECOND FAUN : Ay , many more which we may well divine . But should we stay to speak , noontide would come , And thwart Silenus find his goats undrawn , 90 And grudge to sing those wise and lovely songs Of Fate , and Chance , and God , and Chaos old , And Love , and the chained Titan 's woful doom , And how he shall be loosed , and make the earth One brotherhood : delightful strains which cheer 95 Our solitary twilights , and which charm To silence the unenvying nightingales .</p>

    <p n="222">SCENE 2. 3 : A PINNACLE OF ROCK AMONG MOUNTAINS . ASIA AND PANTHEA .</p>
    <p n="223">PANTHEA : Hither the sound has borne us — to the realm Of Demogorgon , and the mighty portal , Like a volcano 's meteor-breathing chasm , Whence the oracular vapour is hurled up Which lonely men drink wandering in their youth , 5 And call truth , virtue , love , genius , or joy , That maddening wine of life , whose dregs they drain To deep intoxication ; and uplift , Like Maenads who cry loud , Evoe ! Evoe ! The voice which is contagion to the world . 10</p>
    <p n="224">ASIA : Fit throne for such a Power ! Magnificent ! How glorious art thou , Earth ! And if thou be The shadow of some spirit lovelier still , Though evil stain its work , and it should be Like its creation , weak yet beautiful , 15 I could fall down and worship that and thee . Even now my heart adoreth : Wonderful ! Look , sister , ere the vapour dim thy brain : Beneath is a wide plain of billowy mist , As a lake , paving in the morning sky , 20 With azure waves which burst in silver light , Some Indian vale . Behold it , rolling on Under the curdling winds , and islanding The peak whereon we stand , midway , around , Encinctured by the dark and blooming forests , 25 Dim twilight-lawns , and stream-illumined caves , And wind-enchanted shapes of wandering mist ; And far on high the keen sky-cleaving mountains From icy spires of sun-like radiance fling The dawn , as lifted Ocean 's dazzling spray , 30 From some Atlantic islet scattered up , Spangles the wind with lamp-like water-drops . The vale is girdled with their walls , a howl Of cataracts from their thaw-cloven ravines , Satiates the listening wind , continuous , vast , 35 Awful as silence . Hark ! the rushing snow ! The sun-awakened avalanche ! whose mass , Thrice sifted by the storm , had gathered there Flake after flake , in heaven-defying minds As thought by thought is piled , till some great truth 40 Is loosened , and the nations echo round , Shaken to their roots , as do the mountains now .</p>

    <p n="227">ASIA : The fragments of the cloud are scattered up ; The wind that lifts them disentwines my hair ; Its billows now sweep o'er mine eyes ; my brain Grows dizzy ; see'st thou shapes within the mist ? 50</p>

    <p n="231">While the sound whirls around , Down , down ! As the fawn draws the hound , 65 As the lightning the vapour , As a weak moth the taper ; Death , despair ; love , sorrow ; Time both ; to-day , to-morrow ; As steel obeys the spirit of the stone , 70 Down , down !</p>
    <p n="232">Through the gray , void abysm , Down , down ! Where the air is no prism , And the moon and stars are not , 75 And the cavern-crags wear not The radiance of Heaven , Nor the gloom to Earth given , Where there is One pervading , One alone , Down , down ! 80</p>
    <p n="233">In the depth of the deep , Down , down ! Like veiled lightning asleep , Like the spark nursed in embers , The last look Love remembers , 85 Like a diamond , which shines On the dark wealth of mines , A spell is treasured but for thee alone . Down , down !</p>

    <p n="237">ASIA : The veil has fallen .</p>
    <p n="238">PANTHEA : I see a mighty darkness Filling the seat of power , and rays of gloom Dart round , as light from the meridian sun . — Ungazed upon and shapeless ; neither limb , 5 Nor form , nor outline ; yet we feel it is A living Spirit .</p>

    <p n="244">ASIA : Who made all That it contains ? thought , passion , reason , will , 10 Imagination ?</p>
    <p n="245">DEMOGORGON : God : Almighty God .</p>
    <p n="246">ASIA : Who made that sense which , when the winds of Spring In rarest visitation , or the voice Of one beloved heard in youth alone , Fills the faint eyes with falling tears which dim 15 The radiant looks of unbewailing flowers , And leaves this peopled earth a solitude When it returns no more ?</p>
    <p n="247">DEMOGORGON : Merciful God .</p>
    <p n="248">ASIA : And who made terror , madness , crime , remorse , Which from the links of the great chain of things , 20 To every thought within the mind of man Sway and drag heavily , and each one reels Under the load towards the pit of death ; Abandoned hope , and love that turns to hate ; And self-contempt , bitterer to drink than blood ; 25 Pain , whose unheeded and familiar speech Is howling , and keen shrieks , day after day ; And Hell , or the sharp fear of Hell ?</p>
    <p n="249">DEMOGORGON : He reigns .</p>
    <p n="250">ASIA : Utter his name : a world pining in pain Asks but his name : curses shall drag him down . 30</p>
    <p n="251">DEMOGORGON : He reigns .</p>
    <p n="252">ASIA : I feel , I know it : who ?</p>
    <p n="253">DEMOGORGON : He reigns .</p>
    <p n="254">ASIA : Who reigns ? There was the Heaven and Earth at first , And Light and Love ; then Saturn , from whose throne Time fell , an envious shadow : such the state Of the earth 's primal spirits beneath his sway , 35 As the calm joy of flowers and living leaves Before the wind or sun has withered them And semivital worms ; but he refused The birthright of their being , knowledge , power , The skill which wields the elements , the thought 40 Which pierces this dim universe like light , Self-empire , and the majesty of love ; For thirst of which they fainted . Then Prometheus Gave wisdom , which is strength , to Jupiter , And with this law alone , ‘ Let man be free , ’ 45 Clothed him with the dominion of wide Heaven . To know nor faith , nor love , nor law ; to be Omnipotent but friendless is to reign ; And Jove now reigned ; for on the race of man First famine , and then toil , and then disease , 50 Strife , wounds , and ghastly death unseen before , Fell ; and the unseasonable seasons drove With alternating shafts of frost and fire , Their shelterless , pale tribes to mountain caves : And in their desert hearts fierce wants he sent , 55 And mad disquietudes , and shadows idle Of unreal good , which levied mutual war , So ruining the lair wherein they raged . Prometheus saw , and waked the legioned hopes Which sleep within folded Elysian flowers , 60 Nepenthe , Moly , Amaranth , fadeless blooms , That they might hide with thin and rainbow wings The shape of Death ; and Love he sent to bind The disunited tendrils of that vine Which bears the wine of life , the human heart ; 65 And he tamed fire which , like some beast of prey , Most terrible , but lovely , played beneath The frown of man ; and tortured to his will Iron and gold , the slaves and signs of power , And gems and poisons , and all subtlest forms 70 Hidden beneath the mountains and the waves . He gave man speech , and speech created thought , Which is the measure of the universe ; And Science struck the thrones of earth and heaven , Which shook , but fell not ; and the harmonious mind 75 Poured itself forth in all-prophetic song ; And music lifted up the listening spirit Until it walked , exempt from mortal care , Godlike , o'er the clear billows of sweet sound ; And human hands first mimicked and then mocked , 80 With moulded limbs more lovely than its own , The human form , till marble grew divine ; And mothers , gazing , drank the love men see Reflected in their race , behold , and perish . He told the hidden power of herbs and springs , 85 And Disease drank and slept . Death grew like sleep . He taught the implicated orbits woven Of the wide-wandering stars ; and how the sun Changes his lair , and by what secret spell The pale moon is transformed , when her broad eye 90 Gazes not on the interlunar sea : He taught to rule , as life directs the limbs , The tempest-winged chariots of the Ocean , And the Celt knew the Indian . Cities then Were built , and through their snow-like columns flowed 95 The warm winds , and the azure ether shone , And the blue sea and shadowy hills were seen . Such , the alleviations of his state , Prometheus gave to man , for which he hangs Withering in destined pain : but who rains down 100 Evil , the immedicable plague , which , while Man looks on his creation like a God And sees that it is glorious , drives him on , The wreck of his own will , the scorn of earth , The outcast , the abandoned , the alone ? 105 Not Jove : while yet his frown shook Heaven ay , when His adversary from adamantine chains Cursed him , he trembled like a slave . Declare Who is his master ? Is he too a slave ?</p>

    <p n="256">DEMOGORGON : All spirits are enslaved which serve things evil : 110 Thou knowest if Jupiter be such or no .</p>

    <p n="260">DEMOGORGON : If the abysm Could vomit forth its secrets ... But a voice 115 Is wanting , the deep truth is imageless ; For what would it avail to bid thee gaze On the revolving world ?

    <p n="261">ASIA : So much I asked before , and my heart gave The response thou hast given ; and of such truths Each to itself must be the oracle .

Some look behind , as fiends pursued them there , And yet I see no shapes but the keen stars : Others , with burning eyes , lean forth , and drink 135 With eager lips the wind of their own speed , As if the thing they loved fled on before , And now , even now , they clasped it . Their bright locks Stream like a comet 's flashing hair ; they all Sweep onward .</p>
    <p n="264">DEMOGORGON : These are the immortal Hours , 140 Of whom thou didst demand . One waits for thee .</p>
    <p n="265">ASIA : A Spirit with a dreadful countenance Checks its dark chariot by the craggy gulf . Unlike thy brethren , ghastly charioteer , Who art thou ? Whither wouldst thou bear me ? Speak ! 145</p>
    <p n="266">SPIRIT : I am the shadow of a destiny More dread than is my aspect : ere yon planet Has set , the darkness which ascends with me Shall wrap in lasting night heaven 's kingless throne .</p>
    <p n="267">ASIA : What meanest thou ?</p>
    <p n="268">PANTHEA : That terrible shadow floats 150 Up from its throne , as may the lurid smoke Of earthquake-ruined cities o'er the sea . Lo ! it ascends the car ; the coursers fly Terrified : watch its path among the stars Blackening the night !</p>
    <p n="269">ASIA : Thus I am answered : strange ! 155</p>
    <p n="270">PANTHEA : See , near the verge , another chariot stays ; An ivory shell inlaid with crimson fire , Which comes and goes within its sculptured rim Of delicate strange tracery ; the young spirit That guides it has the dove-like eyes of hope ; 160 How its soft smiles attract the soul ! as light Lures winged insects through the lampless air .</p>
    <p n="271">SPIRIT : My coursers are fed with the lightning , They drink of the whirlwind 's stream , And when the red morning is bright'ning 165 They bathe in the fresh sunbeam ; They have strength for their swiftness I deem ; Then ascend with me , daughter of Ocean . I desire : and their speed makes night kindle ; I fear : they outstrip the Typhoon ; 170 Ere the cloud piled on Atlas can dwindle We encircle the earth and the moon : We shall rest from long labours at noon : Then ascend with me , daughter of Ocean .</p>
    <p n="272">SCENE 2. 5 : THE CAR PAUSES WITHIN A CLOUD ON THE TOP OF A SNOWY MOUNTAIN . ASIA , PANTHEA , AND THE SPIRIT OF THE HOUR .</p>
    <p n="273">SPIRIT : On the brink of the night and the morning My coursers are wont to respire ; But the Earth has just whispered a warning That their flight must be swifter than fire : They shall drink the hot speed of desire ! 5</p>
    <p n="274">ASIA : Thou breathest on their nostrils , but my breath Would give them swifter speed .</p>
    <p n="275">SPIRIT : Alas ! it could not .</p>
    <p n="276">PANTHEA : Oh Spirit ! pause , and tell whence is the light Which fills this cloud ? the sun is yet unrisen .</p>
    <p n="277">NOTE : 9 this B ; the 1820 .</p>
    <p n="278">SPIRIT : The sun will rise not until noon . Apollo 10 Is held in heaven by wonder ; and the light Which fills this vapour , as the aereal hue Of fountain-gazing roses fills the water , Flows from thy mighty sister .</p>
    <p n="279">PANTHEA : Yes , I feel —</p>
    <p n="280">ASIA : What is it with thee , sister ? Thou art pale . 15</p>
    <p n="281">PANTHEA : How thou art changed ! I dare not look on thee ; I feel but see thee not . I scarce endure The radiance of thy beauty . Some good change Is working in the elements , which suffer Thy presence thus unveiled . The Nereids tell 20 That on the day when the clear hyaline Was cloven at thine uprise , and thou didst stand Within a veined shell , which floated on Over the calm floor of the crystal sea , Among the Aegean isles , and by the shores 25 Which bear thy name ; love , like the atmosphere Of the sun 's fire filling the living world , Burst from thee , and illumined earth and heaven And the deep ocean and the sunless caves And all that dwells within them ; till grief cast 30 Eclipse upon the soul from which it came : Such art thou now ; nor is it I alone , Thy sister , thy companion , thine own chosen one , But the whole world which seeks thy sympathy . Hearest thou not sounds i ’ the air which speak the love 35 Of all articulate beings ? Feelest thou not The inanimate winds enamoured of thee ? List !</p>

    <p n="284">ASIA : Thy words are sweeter than aught else but his Whose echoes they are ; yet all love is sweet , Given or returned . Common as light is love , 40 And its familiar voice wearies not ever . Like the wide heaven , the all-sustaining air , It makes the reptile equal to the God : They who inspire it most are fortunate , As I am now ; but those who feel it most 45 Are happier still , after long sufferings , As I shall soon become .</p>

    <p n="286">VOICE IN THE AIR , SINGING : Life of Life ! thy lips enkindle With their love the breath between them ; And thy smiles before they dwindle 50 Make the cold air fire ; then screen them In those looks , where whoso gazes Faints , entangled in their mazes .</p>
    <p n="287">Child of Light ! thy limbs are burning Through the vest which seems to hide them ; 55 As the radiant lines of morning Through the clouds ere they divide them ; And this atmosphere divinest Shrouds thee wheresoe'er thou shinest .</p>
    <p n="288">Fair are others ; none beholds thee , 60 But thy voice sounds low and tender Like the fairest , for it folds thee From the sight , that liquid splendour , And all feel , yet see thee never , As I feel now , lost for ever ! 65</p>
    <p n="289">Lamp of Earth ! where'er thou movest Its dim shapes are clad with brightness , And the souls of whom thou lovest Walk upon the winds with lightness , Till they fail , as I am failing , 70 Dizzy , lost , yet unbewailing !</p>

    <p n="291">ASIA : My soul is an enchanted boat , Which , like a sleeping swan , doth float Upon the silver waves of thy sweet singing ; And thine doth like an angel sit 75 Beside a helm conducting it , Whilst all the winds with melody are ringing . It seems to float ever , for ever , Upon that many-winding river , Between mountains , woods , abysses , 80 A paradise of wildernesses ! Till , like one in slumber bound , Borne to the ocean , I float down , around , Into a sea profound , of ever-spreading sound :</p>
    <p n="292">Meanwhile thy spirit lifts its pinions 85 In music 's most serene dominions ; Catching the winds that fan that happy heaven . And we sail on , away , afar , Without a course , without a star , But , by the instinct of sweet music driven ; 90 Till through Elysian garden islets By thee most beautiful of pilots , Where never mortal pinnace glided , The boat of my desire is guided : Realms where the air we breathe is love , 95 Which in the winds on the waves doth move , Harmonizing this earth with what we feel above .</p>
    <p n="293">We have passed Age 's icy caves , And Manhood 's dark and tossing waves , And Youth 's smooth ocean , smiling to betray : 100 Beyond the glassy gulfs we flee Of shadow-peopled Infancy , Through Death and Birth , to a diviner day ; A paradise of vaulted bowers , Lit by downward-gazing flowers , 105 And watery paths that wind between Wildernesses calm and green , Peopled by shapes too bright to see , And rest , having beheld ; somewhat like thee ; Which walk upon the sea , and chant melodiously ! 110</p>

    <p n="298">JUPITER : Ye congregated powers of heaven , who share The glory and the strength of him ye serve , Rejoice ! henceforth I am omnipotent . All else had been subdued to me ; alone The soul of man , like unextinguished fire , 5 Yet burns towards heaven with fierce reproach , and doubt , And lamentation , and reluctant prayer , Hurling up insurrection , which might make Our antique empire insecure , though built On eldest faith , and hell 's coeval , fear ; 10 And though my curses through the pendulous air , Like snow on herbless peaks , fall flake by flake , And cling to it ; though under my wrath 's night It climbs the crags of life , step after step , Which wound it , as ice wounds unsandalled feet , 15 It yet remains supreme o'er misery , Aspiring , unrepressed , yet soon to fall : Even now have I begotten a strange wonder , That fatal child , the terror of the earth , Who waits but till the destined hour arrive , 20 Bearing from Demogorgon 's vacant throne The dreadful might of ever-living limbs Which clothed that awful spirit unbeheld , To redescend , and trample out the spark . Pour forth heaven 's wine , Idaean Ganymede , 25 And let it fill the Daedal cups like fire , And from the flower-inwoven soil divine Ye all-triumphant harmonies arise , As dew from earth under the twilight stars : Drink ! be the nectar circling through your veins 30 The soul of joy , ye ever-living Gods , Till exultation burst in one wide voice Like music from Elysian winds . And thou Ascend beside me , veiled in the light Of the desire which makes thee one with me , 35 Thetis , bright image of eternity ! When thou didst cry , ‘ Insufferable might ! God ! Spare me ! I sustain not the quick flames , The penetrating presence ; all my being , Like him whom the Numidian seps did thaw 40 Into a dew with poison , is dissolved , Sinking through its foundations : ’ even then Two mighty spirits , mingling , made a third Mightier than either , which , unbodied now , Between us floats , felt , although unbeheld , 45 Waiting the incarnation , which ascends , ( Hear ye the thunder of the fiery wheels Griding the winds ? ) from Demogorgon 's throne . Victory ! victory ! Feel'st thou not , O world , The earthquake of his chariot thundering up 50 Olympus ? [ THE CAR OF THE HOUR ARRIVES .

    <p n="315">HERCULES : Most glorious among Spirits , thus doth strength To wisdom , courage , and long-suffering love , And thee , who art the form they animate , Minister like a slave .</p>
    <p n="316">PROMETHEUS : Thy gentle words Are sweeter even than freedom long desired 5 And long delayed . Asia , thou light of life , Shadow of beauty unbeheld : and ye , Fair sister nymphs , who made long years of pain Sweet to remember , through your love and care : Henceforth we will not part . There is a cave , 10 All overgrown with trailing odorous plants , Which curtain out the day with leaves and flowers , And paved with veined emerald , and a fountain Leaps in the midst with an awakening sound . From its curved roof the mountain 's frozen tears 15 Like snow , or silver , or long diamond spires , Hang downward , raining forth a doubtful light : And there is heard the ever-moving air , Whispering without from tree to tree , and birds , And bees ; and all around are mossy seats , 20 And the rough walls are clothed with long soft grass ; A simple dwelling , which shall be our own ; Where we will sit and talk of time and change , As the world ebbs and flows , ourselves unchanged . What can hide man from mutability ? 25 And if ye sigh , then I will smile ; and thou , Ione , shalt chant fragments of sea-music , Until I weep , when ye shall smile away The tears she brought , which yet were sweet to shed . We will entangle buds and flowers and beams 30 Which twinkle on the fountain 's brim , and make Strange combinations out of common things , Like human babes in their brief innocence ; And we will search , with looks and words of love , For hidden thoughts , each lovelier than the last , 35 Our unexhausted spirits ; and like lutes Touched by the skill of the enamoured wind , Weave harmonies divine , yet ever new , From difference sweet where discord cannot be ; And hither come , sped on the charmed winds , 40 Which meet from all the points of heaven , as bees From every flower aereal Enna feeds , At their known island-homes in Himera , The echoes of the human world , which tell Of the low voice of love , almost unheard , 45 And dove-eyed pity 's murmured pain , and music , Itself the echo of the heart , and all That tempers or improves man 's life , now free ; And lovely apparitions ,— dim at first , Then radiant , as the mind , arising bright 50 From the embrace of beauty ( whence the forms Of which these are the phantoms ) casts on them The gathered rays which are reality — Shall visit us , the progeny immortal Of Painting , Sculpture , and rapt Poesy , 55 And arts , though unimagined , yet to be . The wandering voices and the shadows these Of all that man becomes , the mediators Of that best worship love , by him and us Given and returned ; swift shapes and sounds , which grow 60 More fair and soft as man grows wise and kind , And , veil by veil , evil and error fall : Such virtue has the cave and place around . [ TURNING TO THE SPIRIT OF THE HOUR . ] For thee , fair Spirit , one toil remains . Ione , Give her that curved shell , which Proteus old 65 Made Asia 's nuptial boon , breathing within it A voice to be accomplished , and which thou Didst hide in grass under the hollow rock .</p>
    <p n="317">IONE : Thou most desired Hour , more loved and lovely Than all thy sisters , this is the mystic shell ; 70 See the pale azure fading into silver Lining it with a soft yet glowing light : Looks it not like lulled music sleeping there ?</p>

Henceforth the many children fair 90 Folded in my sustaining arms ; all plants , And creeping forms , and insects rainbow-winged , And birds , and beasts , and fish , and human shapes , Which drew disease and pain from my wan bosom , Draining the poison of despair , shall take 95 And interchange sweet nutriment ; to me Shall they become like sister-antelopes By one fair dam , snow-white and swift as wind , Nursed among lilies near a brimming stream . The dew-mists of my sunless sleep shall float 100 Under the stars like balm : night-folded flowers Shall suck unwithering hues in their repose : And men and beasts in happy dreams shall gather Strength for the coming day , and all its joy : And death shall be the last embrace of her 105 Who takes the life she gave , even as a mother , Folding her child , says , ‘ Leave me not again . ’</p>

    <p n="323">THE EARTH : It would avail not to reply : 110 Thou art immortal , and this tongue is known But to the uncommunicating dead . Death is the veil which those who live call life : They sleep , and it is lifted : and meanwhile In mild variety the seasons mild 115 With rainbow-skirted showers , and odorous winds , And long blue meteors cleansing the dull night , And the life-kindling shafts of the keen sun 's All-piercing bow , and the dew-mingled rain Of the calm moonbeams , a soft influence mild , 120 Shall clothe the forests and the fields , ay , even The crag-built deserts of the barren deep , With ever-living leaves , and fruits , and flowers . And thou ! There is a cavern where my spirit Was panted forth in anguish whilst thy pain 125 Made my heart mad , and those who did inhale it Became mad too , and built a temple there , And spoke , and were oracular , and lured The erring nations round to mutual war , And faithless faith , such as Jove kept with thee ; 130 Which breath now rises , as amongst tall weeds A violet 's exhalation , and it fills With a serener light and crimson air Intense , yet soft , the rocks and woods around ; It feeds the quick growth of the serpent vine , 135 And the dark linked ivy tangling wild , And budding , blown , or odour-faded blooms Which star the winds with points of coloured light , As they rain through them , and bright golden globes Of fruit , suspended in their own green heaven , 140 And through their veined leaves and amber stems The flowers whose purple and translucid bowls Stand ever mantling with aereal dew , The drink of spirits : and it circles round , Like the soft waving wings of noonday dreams , 145 Inspiring calm and happy thoughts , like mine , Now thou art thus restored . This cave is thine . Arise ! Appear ! [ A SPIRIT RISES IN THE LIKENESS OF A WINGED CHILD . ] This is my torch-bearer ; Who let his lamp out in old time with gazing On eyes from which he kindled it anew 150 With love , which is as fire , sweet daughter mine , For such is that within thine own . Run , wayward , And guide this company beyond the peak Of Bacchic Nysa , Maenad-haunted mountain , And beyond Indus and its tribute rivers , 155 Trampling the torrent streams and glassy lakes With feet unwet , unwearied , undelaying , And up the green ravine , across the vale , Beside the windless and crystalline pool , Where ever lies , on unerasing waves , 160 The image of a temple , built above , Distinct with column , arch , and architrave , And palm-like capital , and over-wrought , And populous with most living imagery , Praxitelean shapes , whose marble smiles 165 Fill the hushed air with everlasting love . It is deserted now , but once it bore Thy name , Prometheus ; there the emulous youths Bore to thy honour through the divine gloom The lamp which was thine emblem ; even as those 170 Who bear the untransmitted torch of hope Into the grave , across the night of life , As thou hast borne it most triumphantly To this far goal of Time . Depart , farewell . Beside that temple is the destined cave . 175</p>

    <p n="326">IONE : Sister , it is not earthly : how it glides Under the leaves ! how on its head there burns A light , like a green star , whose emerald beams Are twined with its fair hair ! how , as it moves , The splendour drops in flakes upon the grass ! 5 Knowest thou it ?</p>
    <p n="327">PANTHEA : It is the delicate spirit That guides the earth through heaven . From afar The populous constellations call that light The loveliest of the planets ; and sometimes It floats along the spray of the salt sea , 10 Or makes its chariot of a foggy cloud , Or walks through fields or cities while men sleep , Or o'er the mountain tops , or down the rivers , Or through the green waste wilderness , as now , Wondering at all it sees . Before Jove reigned 15 It loved our sister Asia , and it came Each leisure hour to drink the liquid light Out of her eyes , for which it said it thirsted As one bit by a dipsas , and with her It made its childish confidence , and told her 20 All it had known or seen , for it saw much , Yet idly reasoned what it saw ; and called her — For whence it sprung it knew not , nor do I — Mother , dear mother .</p>
    <p n="328">THE SPIRIT OF THE EARTH [ RUNNING TO ASIA ]: Mother , dearest mother ; May I then talk with thee as I was wont ? 25 May I then hide my eyes in thy soft arms , After thy looks have made them tired of joy ? May I then play beside thee the long noons , When work is none in the bright silent air ?</p>
    <p n="329">ASIA : I love thee , gentlest being , and henceforth 30 Can cherish thee unenvied : speak , I pray : Thy simple talk once solaced , now delights .</p>
    <p n="330">SPIRIT OF THE EARTH : Mother , I am grown wiser , though a child Cannot be wise like thee , within this day ; And happier too ; happier and wiser both . 35 Thou knowest that toads , and snakes , and loathly worms , And venomous and malicious beasts , and boughs That bore ill berries in the woods , were ever An hindrance to my walks o'er the green world : And that , among the haunts of humankind , 40 Hard-featured men , or with proud , angry looks , Or cold , staid gait , or false and hollow smiles , Or the dull sneer of self-loved ignorance , Or other such foul masks , with which ill thoughts Hide that fair being whom we spirits call man ; 45 And women too , ugliest of all things evil , ( Though fair , even in a world where thou art fair , When good and kind , free and sincere like thee ) When false or frowning made me sick at heart To pass them , though they slept , and I unseen . 50 Well , my path lately lay through a great city Into the woody hills surrounding it : A sentinel was sleeping at the gate : When there was heard a sound , so loud , it shook The towers amid the moonlight , yet more sweet 55 Than any voice but thine , sweetest of all ; A long , long sound , as it would never end : And all the inhabitants leaped suddenly Out of their rest , and gathered in the streets , Looking in wonder up to Heaven , while yet 60 The music pealed along . I hid myself Within a fountain in the public square , Where I lay like the reflex of the moon Seen in a wave under green leaves ; and soon Those ugly human shapes and visages 65 Of which I spoke as having wrought me pain , Passed floating through the air , and fading still Into the winds that scattered them ; and those From whom they passed seemed mild and lovely forms After some foul disguise had fallen , and all 70 Were somewhat changed , and after brief surprise And greetings of delighted wonder , all Went to their sleep again : and when the dawn Came , wouldst thou think that toads , and snakes , and efts , Could e'er be beautiful ? yet so they were , 75 And that with little change of shape or hue : All things had put their evil nature off : I cannot tell my joy , when o'er a lake , Upon a drooping bough with nightshade twined , I saw two azure halcyons clinging downward 80 And thinning one bright bunch of amber berries , With quick long beaks , and in the deep there lay Those lovely forms imaged as in a sky ; So , with my thoughts full of these happy changes , We meet again , the happiest change of all . 85</p>
    <p n="331">ASIA : And never will we part , till thy chaste sister Who guides the frozen and inconstant moon Will look on thy more warm and equal light Till her heart thaw like flakes of April snow And love thee .</p>
    <p n="332">SPIRIT OF THE EARTH : What ! as Asia loves Prometheus ? 90</p>
    <p n="333">ASIA : Peace , wanton , thou art yet not old enough . Think ye by gazing on each other 's eyes To multiply your lovely selves , and fill With sphered fires the interlunar air ?</p>
    <p n="334">SPIRIT OF THE EARTH : Nay , mother , while my sister trims her lamp ‘ Tis hard I should go darkling . 95</p>

    <p n="336">[ THE SPIRIT OF THE HOUR ENTERS . ]</p>
    <p n="337">PROMETHEUS : We feel what thou hast heard and seen : yet speak .</p>
    <p n="338">SPIRIT OF THE HOUR : Soon as the sound had ceased whose thunder filled The abysses of the sky and the wide earth , There was a change : the impalpable thin air 100 And the all-circling sunlight were transformed , As if the sense of love dissolved in them Had folded itself round the sphered world . My vision then grew clear , and I could see Into the mysteries of the universe : 105 Dizzy as with delight I floated down , Winnowing the lightsome air with languid plumes , My coursers sought their birthplace in the sun , Where they henceforth will live exempt from toil , Pasturing flowers of vegetable fire ; 110 And where my moonlike car will stand within A temple , gazed upon by Phidian forms Of thee , and Asia , and the Earth , and me , And you fair nymphs looking the love we feel ,— In memory of the tidings it has borne ,— 115 Beneath a dome fretted with graven flowers , Poised on twelve columns of resplendent stone , And open to the bright and liquid sky . Yoked to it by an amphisbaenic snake The likeness of those winged steeds will mock 120 The flight from which they find repose . Alas , Whither has wandered now my partial tongue When all remains untold which ye would hear ? As I have said , I floated to the earth : It was , as it is still , the pain of bliss 125 To move , to breathe , to be . I wandering went Among the haunts and dwellings of mankind , And first was disappointed not to see Such mighty change as I had felt within Expressed in outward things ; but soon I looked , 130 And behold , thrones were kingless , and men walked One with the other even as spirits do , None fawned , none trampled ; hate , disdain , or fear , Self-love or self-contempt , on human brows No more inscribed , as o'er the gate of hell , 135 ‘ All hope abandon ye who enter here ; ’ None frowned , none trembled , none with eager fear Gazed on another 's eye of cold command , Until the subject of a tyrant 's will Became , worse fate , the abject of his own , 140 Which spurred him , like an outspent horse , to death . None wrought his lips in truth-entangling lines Which smiled the lie his tongue disdained to speak ; None , with firm sneer , trod out in his own heart The sparks of love and hope till there remained 145 Those bitter ashes , a soul self-consumed , And the wretch crept a vampire among men , Infecting all with his own hideous ill ; None talked that common , false , cold , hollow talk Which makes the heart deny the “ yes ” it breathes , 150 Yet question that unmeant hypocrisy With such a self-mistrust as has no name . And women , too , frank , beautiful , and kind As the free heaven which rains fresh light and dew On the wide earth , past ; gentle radiant forms , 155 From custom 's evil taint exempt and pure ; Speaking the wisdom once they could not think , Looking emotions once they feared to feel , And changed to all which once they dared not be , Yet being now , made earth like heaven ; nor pride , 160 Nor jealousy , nor envy , nor ill shame , The bitterest of those drops of treasured gall , Spoiled the sweet taste of the nepenthe , love .</p>
    <p n="339">Thrones , altars , judgement-seats , and prisons ; wherein , And beside which , by wretched men were borne 165 Sceptres , tiaras , swords , and chains , and tomes Of reasoned wrong , glozed on by ignorance , Were like those monstrous and barbaric shapes , The ghosts of a no-more-remembered fame , Which , from their unworn obelisks , look forth 170 In triumph o'er the palaces and tombs Of those who were their conquerors : mouldering round , These imaged to the pride of kings and priests A dark yet mighty faith , a power as wide As is the world it wasted , and are now 175 But an astonishment ; even so the tools And emblems of its last captivity , Amid the dwellings of the peopled earth , Stand , not o'erthrown , but unregarded now . And those foul shapes , abhorred by god and man ,— 180 Which , under many a name and many a form Strange , savage , ghastly , dark and execrable , Were Jupiter , the tyrant of the world ; And which the nations , panic-stricken , served With blood , and hearts broken by long hope , and love 185 Dragged to his altars soiled and garlandless , And slain among men 's unreclaiming tears , Flattering the thing they feared , which fear was hate ,— Frown , mouldering fast , o'er their abandoned shrines : The painted veil , by those who were , called life , 190 Which mimicked , as with colours idly spread , All men believed and hoped , is torn aside ; The loathsome mask has fallen , the man remains Sceptreless , free , uncircumscribed , but man Equal , unclassed , tribeless , and nationless , 195 Exempt from awe , worship , degree , the king Over himself ; just , gentle , wise ; but man Passionless ?— no , yet free from guilt or pain , Which were , for his will made or suffered them , Nor yet exempt , though ruling them like slaves , 200 From chance , and death , and mutability , The clogs of that which else might oversoar The loftiest star of unascended heaven , Pinnacled dim in the intense inane .</p>

    <p n="347">Strew , oh , strew 15 Hair , not yew ! Wet the dusty pall with tears , not dew ! Be the faded flowers Of Death 's bare bowers Spread on the corpse of the King of Hours ! 20</p>
    <p n="348">Haste , oh , haste ! As shades are chased , Trembling , by day , from heaven 's blue waste . We melt away , Like dissolving spray , 25 From the children of a diviner day , With the lullaby Of winds that die On the bosom of their own harmony !</p>
    <p n="349">IONE : What dark forms were they ? 30</p>
    <p n="350">PANTHEA : The past Hours weak and gray , With the spoil which their toil Raked together From the conquest but One could foil .</p>

    <p n="356">The pine boughs are singing Old songs with new gladness , The billows and fountains 50 Fresh music are flinging , Like the notes of a spirit from land and from sea ; The storms mock the mountains With the thunder of gladness . But where are ye ? 55</p>

    <p n="362">SEMICHORUS 1 : An hundred ages we had been kept Cradled in visions of hate and care , And each one who waked as his brother slept , Found the truth —</p>

    <p n="364">SEMICHORUS 1 : We have heard the lute of Hope in sleep ; 65 We have known the voice of Love in dreams ; We have felt the wand of Power , and leap —</p>
    <p n="365">SEMICHORUS 2 : As the billows leap in the morning beams !</p>
    <p n="366">CHORUS : Weave the dance on the floor of the breeze , Pierce with song heaven 's silent light , 70 Enchant the day that too swiftly flees , To check its flight ere the cave of Night .</p>
    <p n="367">Once the hungry Hours were hounds Which chased the day like a bleeding deer , And it limped and stumbled with many wounds 75 Through the nightly dells of the desert year .</p>

    <p n="370">PANTHEA : See , where the Spirits of the human mind Wrapped in sweet sounds , as in bright veils , approach .</p>
    <p n="371">CHORUS OF SPIRITS : We join the throng Of the dance and the song , By the whirlwind of gladness borne along ; 85 As the flying-fish leap From the Indian deep , And mix with the sea-birds , half-asleep .</p>
    <p n="372">CHORUS OF HOURS : Whence come ye , so wild and so fleet , For sandals of lightning are on your feet , 90 And your wings are soft and swift as thought , And your eyes are as love which is veiled not ?</p>
    <p n="373">CHORUS OF SPIRITS : We come from the mind Of human kind Which was late so dusk , and obscene , and blind , 95 Now ‘ tis an ocean Of clear emotion , A heaven of serene and mighty motion .</p>
    <p n="374">From that deep abyss Of wonder and bliss , 100 Whose caverns are crystal palaces ; From those skiey towers Where Thought 's crowned powers Sit watching your dance , ye happy Hours !</p>
    <p n="375">From the dim recesses 105 Of woven caresses , Where lovers catch ye by your loose tresses ; From the azure isles , Where sweet Wisdom smiles , Delaying your ships with her siren wiles . 110</p>
    <p n="376">From the temples high Of Man 's ear and eye , Roofed over Sculpture and Poesy ; From the murmurings Of the unsealed springs 115 Where Science bedews her Daedal wings .</p>
    <p n="377">Years after years , Through blood , and tears , And a thick hell of hatreds , and hopes , and fears ; We waded and flew , 120 And the islets were few Where the bud-blighted flowers of happiness grew .</p>
    <p n="378">Our feet now , every palm , Are sandalled with calm , And the dew of our wings is a rain of balm ; 125 And , beyond our eyes , The human love lies Which makes all it gazes on Paradise .</p>

    <p n="380">CHORUS OF SPIRITS AND HOURS : Then weave the web of the mystic measure ; From the depths of the sky and the ends of the earth , 130 Come , swift Spirits of might and of pleasure , Fill the dance and the music of mirth , As the waves of a thousand streams rush by To an ocean of splendour and harmony !</p>
    <p n="381">CHORUS OF SPIRITS : Our spoil is won , 135 Our task is done , We are free to dive , or soar , or run ; Beyond and around , Or within the bound Which clips the world with darkness round . 140</p>
    <p n="382">We 'll pass the eyes Of the starry skies Into the hoar deep to colonize ; Death , Chaos , and Night , From the sound of our flight , 145 Shall flee , like mist from a tempest 's might .</p>
    <p n="383">And Earth , Air , and Light , And the Spirit of Might , Which drives round the stars in their fiery flight ; And Love , Thought , and Breath , 150 The powers that quell Death , Wherever we soar shall assemble beneath .</p>

    <p n="392">CHORUS OF HOURS AND SPIRITS : Break the dance , and scatter the song ; 175 Let some depart , and some remain , Wherever we fly we lead along In leashes , like starbeams , soft yet strong , The clouds that are heavy with love 's sweet rain .</p>
    <p n="393">PANTHEA : Ha ! they are gone !</p>
    <p n="394">IONE : Yet feel you no delight 180 From the past sweetness ?</p>
    <p n="395">PANTHEA : As the bare green hill When some soft cloud vanishes into rain , Laughs with a thousand drops of sunny water To the unpavilioned sky !</p>
    <p n="396">IONE : Even whilst we speak New notes arise . What is that awful sound ? 185</p>
    <p n="397">PANTHEA : ‘ Tis the deep music of the rolling world Kindling within the strings of the waved air Aeolian modulations .</p>
    <p n="398">IONE : Listen too , How every pause is filled with under-notes , Clear , silver , icy , keen awakening tones , 190 Which pierce the sense , and live within the soul , As the sharp stars pierce winter 's crystal air And gaze upon themselves within the sea .</p>
    <p n="399">PANTHEA : But see where through two openings in the forest Which hanging branches overcanopy , 195 And where two runnels of a rivulet , Between the close moss violet-inwoven , Have made their path of melody , like sisters Who part with sighs that they may meet in smiles , Turning their dear disunion to an isle 200 Of lovely grief , a wood of sweet sad thoughts ; Two visions of strange radiance float upon The ocean-like enchantment of strong sound , Which flows intenser , keener , deeper yet Under the ground and through the windless air . 205</p>
    <p n="400">IONE : I see a chariot like that thinnest boat , In which the Mother of the Months is borne By ebbing light into her western cave , When she upsprings from interlunar dreams ; O'er which is curved an orblike canopy 210 Of gentle darkness , and the hills and woods , Distinctly seen through that dusk aery veil , Regard like shapes in an enchanter 's glass ; Its wheels are solid clouds , azure and gold , Such as the genii of the thunderstorm 215 Pile on the floor of the illumined sea When the sun rushes under it ; they roll And move and grow as with an inward wind ; Within it sits a winged infant , white Its countenance , like the whiteness of bright snow , 220 Its plumes are as feathers of sunny frost , Its limbs gleam white , through the wind-flowing folds Of its white robe , woof of ethereal pearl . Its hair is white , the brightness of white light Scattered in strings ; yet its two eyes are heavens 225 Of liquid darkness , which the Deity Within seems pouring , as a storm is poured From jagged clouds , out of their arrowy lashes , Tempering the cold and radiant air around , With fire that is not brightness ; in its hand 230 It sways a quivering moonbeam , from whose point A guiding power directs the chariot 's prow Over its wheeled clouds , which as they roll Over the grass , and flowers , and waves , wake sounds , Sweet as a singing rain of silver dew . 235</p>

    <p n="402">PANTHEA : And from the other opening in the wood Rushes , with loud and whirlwind harmony , A sphere , which is as many thousand spheres , Solid as crystal , yet through all its mass Flow , as through empty space , music and light : 240 Ten thousand orbs involving and involved , Purple and azure , white , and green , and golden , Sphere within sphere ; and every space between Peopled with unimaginable shapes , Such as ghosts dream dwell in the lampless deep , 245 Yet each inter-transpicuous , and they whirl Over each other with a thousand motions , Upon a thousand sightless axles spinning , And with the force of self-destroying swiftness , Intensely , slowly , solemnly , roll on , 250 Kindling with mingled sounds , and many tones , Intelligible words and music wild . With mighty whirl the multitudinous orb Grinds the bright brook into an azure mist Of elemental subtlety , like light ; 255 And the wild odour of the forest flowers , The music of the living grass and air , The emerald light of leaf-entangled beams Round its intense yet self-conflicting speed , Seem kneaded into one aereal mass 260 Which drowns the sense . Within the orb itself , Pillowed upon its alabaster arms , Like to a child o'erwearied with sweet toil , On its own folded wings , and wavy hair , The Spirit of the Earth is laid asleep , 265 And you can see its little lips are moving , Amid the changing light of their own smiles , Like one who talks of what he loves in dream .</p>

The beams flash on And make appear the melancholy ruins Of cancelled cycles ; anchors , beaks of ships ; Planks turned to marble ; quivers , helms , and spears , 290 And gorgon-headed targes , and the wheels Of scythed chariots , and the emblazonry Of trophies , standards , and armorial beasts , Round which death laughed , sepulchred emblems Of dead destruction , ruin within ruin ! 295 The wrecks beside of many a city vast , Whose population which the earth grew over Was mortal , but not human ; see , they lie , Their monstrous works , and uncouth skeletons , Their statues , homes and fanes ; prodigious shapes 300 Huddled in gray annihilation , split , Jammed in the hard , black deep ; and over these , The anatomies of unknown winged things , And fishes which were isles of living scale , And serpents , bony chains , twisted around 305 The iron crags , or within heaps of dust To which the tortuous strength of their last pangs Had crushed the iron crags ; and over these The jagged alligator , and the might Of earth-convulsing behemoth , which once 310 Were monarch beasts , and on the slimy shores , And weed-overgrown continents of earth , Increased and multiplied like summer worms On an abandoned corpse , till the blue globe Wrapped deluge round it like a cloak , and they 315 Yelled , gasped , and were abolished ; or some God Whose throne was in a comet , passed , and cried , ‘ Be not ! ’ And like my words they were no more .</p>

    <p n="412">How art thou sunk , withdrawn , covered , drunk up 350 By thirsty nothing , as the brackish cup Drained by a desert-troop , a little drop for all ; And from beneath , around , within , above , Filling thy void annihilation , love Bursts in like light on caves cloven by the thunder-ball . 355</p>

    <p n="415">Gazing on thee I feel , I know Green stalks burst forth , and bright flowers grow , And living shapes upon my bosom move : 365 Music is in the sea and air , Winged clouds soar here and there , Dark with the rain new buds are dreaming of : ‘ Tis love , all love !</p>
    <p n="416">THE EARTH : It interpenetrates my granite mass , 370 Through tangled roots and trodden clay doth pass Into the utmost leaves and delicatest flowers ; Upon the winds , among the clouds ‘ tis spread , It wakes a life in the forgotten dead , They breathe a spirit up from their obscurest bowers . 375</p>
    <p n="417">And like a storm bursting its cloudy prison With thunder , and with whirlwind , has arisen Out of the lampless caves of unimagined being : With earthquake shock and swiftness making shiver Thought 's stagnant chaos , unremoved for ever , 380 Till hate , and fear , and pain , light-vanquished shadows , fleeing ,</p>
    <p n="418">Leave Man , who was a many-sided mirror , Which could distort to many a shape of error , This true fair world of things , a sea reflecting love ; Which over all his kind , as the sun 's heaven 385 Gliding o'er ocean , smooth , serene , and even , Darting from starry depths radiance and life , doth move :</p>
    <p n="419">Leave Man , even as a leprous child is left , Who follows a sick beast to some warm cleft Of rocks , through which the might of healing springs is poured ; 390 Then when it wanders home with rosy smile , Unconscious , and its mother fears awhile It is a spirit , then , weeps on her child restored .</p>
    <p n="420">Man , oh , not men ! a chain of linked thought , Of love and might to be divided not , 395 Compelling the elements with adamantine stress ; As the sun rules , even with a tyrant 's gaze , The unquiet republic of the maze Of planets , struggling fierce towards heaven 's free wilderness .</p>
    <p n="421">Man , one harmonious soul of many a soul , 400 Whose nature is its own divine control , Where all things flow to all , as rivers to the sea ; Familiar acts are beautiful through love ; Labour , and pain , and grief , in life 's green grove Sport like tame beasts , none knew how gentle they could be ! 405</p>
    <p n="422">His will , with all mean passions , bad delights , And selfish cares , its trembling satellites , A spirit ill to guide , but mighty to obey , Is as a tempest-winged ship , whose helm Love rules , through waves which dare not overwhelm , 410 Forcing life 's wildest shores to own its sovereign sway .</p>
    <p n="423">All things confess his strength . Through the cold mass Of marble and of colour his dreams pass ; Bright threads whence mothers weave the robes their children wear ; Language is a perpetual Orphic song , 415 Which rules with Daedal harmony a throng Of thoughts and forms , which else senseless and shapeless were .</p>
    <p n="424">The lightning is his slave ; heaven 's utmost deep Gives up her stars , and like a flock of sheep They pass before his eye , are numbered , and roll on ! 420 The tempest is his steed , he strides the air ; And the abyss shouts from her depth laid bare , Heaven , hast thou secrets ? Man unveils me ; I have none .</p>

    <p n="427">THE EARTH : As the dissolving warmth of dawn may fold A half unfrozen dew-globe , green , and gold , And crystalline , till it becomes a winged mist , And wanders up the vault of the blue day , Outlives the noon , and on the sun 's last ray 435 Hangs o'er the sea , a fleece of fire and amethyst .</p>

    <p n="430">THE EARTH : I spin beneath my pyramid of night , Which points into the heavens dreaming delight , 445 Murmuring victorious joy in my enchanted sleep ; As a youth lulled in love-dreams faintly sighing , Under the shadow of his beauty lying , Which round his rest a watch of light and warmth doth keep .</p>
    <p n="431">THE MOON : As in the soft and sweet eclipse , 450 When soul meets soul on lovers ’ lips , High hearts are calm , and brightest eyes are dull ; So when thy shadow falls on me , Then am I mute and still , by thee Covered ; of thy love , Orb most beautiful , 455 Full , oh , too full !</p>

    <p n="436">PANTHEA : Peace ! peace ! a mighty Power , which is as darkness , 510 Is rising out of Earth , and from the sky Is showered like night , and from within the air Bursts , like eclipse which had been gathered up Into the pores of sunlight : the bright visions , Wherein the singing spirits rode and shone , 515 Gleam like pale meteors through a watery night .</p>

    <p n="477">NOTE ON “ PROMETHEUS UNBOUND ” , BY MRS. SHELLEY .</p>
    <p n="478">On the 12th of March , 1818 , Shelley quitted England , never to return . His principal motive was the hope that his health would be improved by a milder climate ; he suffered very much during the winter previous to his emigration , and this decided his vacillating purpose . In December , 1817 , he had written from Marlow to a friend , saying :</p>
    <p n="479">‘ My health has been materially worse . My feelings at intervals are of a deadly and torpid kind , or awakened to such a state of unnatural and keen excitement that , only to instance the organ of sight , I find the very blades of grass and the boughs of distant trees present themselves to me with microscopic distinctness . Towards evening I sink into a state of lethargy and inanimation , and often remain for hours on the sofa between sleep and waking , a prey to the most painful irritability of thought . Such , with little intermission , is my condition . The hours devoted to study are selected with vigilant caution from among these periods of endurance . It is not for this that I think of travelling to Italy , even if I knew that Italy would relieve me . But I have experienced a decisive pulmonary attack ; and although at present it has passed away without any considerable vestige of its existence , yet this symptom sufficiently shows the true nature of my disease to be consumptive . It is to my advantage that this malady is in its nature slow , and , if one is sufficiently alive to its advances , is susceptible of cure from a warm climate . In the event of its assuming any decided shape , IT WOULD BE MY DUTY to go to Italy without delay . It is not mere health , but life , that I should seek , and that not for my own sake — I feel I am capable of trampling on all such weakness ; but for the sake of those to whom my life may be a source of happiness , utility , security , and honour , and to some of whom my death might be all that is the reverse . ’</p>
    <p n="480">In almost every respect his journey to Italy was advantageous . He left behind friends to whom he was attached ; but cares of a thousand kinds , many springing from his lavish generosity , crowded round him in his native country , and , except the society of one or two friends , he had no compensation . The climate caused him to consume half his existence in helpless suffering . His dearest pleasure , the free enjoyment of the scenes of Nature , was marred by the same circumstance .</p>
    <p n="481">He went direct to Italy , avoiding even Paris , and did not make any pause till he arrived at Milan . The first aspect of Italy enchanted Shelley ; it seemed a garden of delight placed beneath a clearer and brighter heaven than any he had lived under before . He wrote long descriptive letters during the first year of his residence in Italy , which , as compositions , are the most beautiful in the world , and show how truly he appreciated and studied the wonders of Nature and Art in that divine land .</p>
    <p n="482">The poetical spirit within him speedily revived with all the power and with more than all the beauty of his first attempts . He meditated three subjects as the groundwork for lyrical dramas . One was the story of Tasso ; of this a slight fragment of a song of Tasso remains . The other was one founded on the Book of Job , which he never abandoned in idea , but of which no trace remains among his papers . The third was the “ Prometheus Unbound ” . The Greek tragedians were now his most familiar companions in his wanderings , and the sublime majesty of Aeschylus filled him with wonder and delight . The father of Greek tragedy does not possess the pathos of Sophocles , nor the variety and tenderness of Euripides ; the interest on which he founds his dramas is often elevated above human vicissitudes into the mighty passions and throes of gods and demi-gods : such fascinated the abstract imagination of Shelley .</p>
    <p n="483">We spent a month at Milan , visiting the Lake of Como during that interval . Thence we passed in succession to Pisa , Leghorn , the Baths of Lucca , Venice , Este , Rome , Naples , and back again to Rome , whither we returned early in March , 1819 . During all this time Shelley meditated the subject of his drama , and wrote portions of it . Other poems were composed during this interval , and while at the Bagni di Lucca he translated Plato 's “ Symposium ” . But , though he diversified his studies , his thoughts centred in the Prometheus . At last , when at Rome , during a bright and beautiful Spring , he gave up his whole time to the composition . The spot selected for his study was , as he mentions in his preface , the mountainous ruins of the Baths of Caracalla . These are little known to the ordinary visitor at Rome . He describes them in a letter , with that poetry and delicacy and truth of description which render his narrated impressions of scenery of unequalled beauty and interest .</p>
    <p n="484">At first he completed the drama in three acts . It was not till several months after , when at Florence , that he conceived that a fourth act , a sort of hymn of rejoicing in the fulfilment of the prophecies with regard to Prometheus , ought to be added to complete the composition .</p>
    <p n="485">The prominent feature of Shelley 's theory of the destiny of the human species was that evil is not inherent in the system of the creation , but an accident that might be expelled . This also forms a portion of Christianity : God made earth and man perfect , till he , by his fall ,</p>
    <p n="486">‘ Brought death into the world and all our woe . ’</p>
    <p n="487">Shelley believed that mankind had only to will that there should be no evil , and there would be none . It is not my part in these Notes to notice the arguments that have been urged against this opinion , but to mention the fact that he entertained it , and was indeed attached to it with fervent enthusiasm . That man could be so perfectionized as to be able to expel evil from his own nature , and from the greater part of the creation , was the cardinal point of his system . And the subject he loved best to dwell on was the image of One warring with the Evil Principle , oppressed not only by it , but by all — even the good , who were deluded into considering evil a necessary portion of humanity ; a victim full of fortitude and hope and the spirit of triumph emanating from a reliance in the ultimate omnipotence of Good . Such he had depicted in his last poem , when he made Laon the enemy and the victim of tyrants . He now took a more idealized image of the same subject . He followed certain classical authorities in figuring Saturn as the good principle , Jupiter the usurping evil one , and Prometheus as the regenerator , who , unable to bring mankind back to primitive innocence , used knowledge as a weapon to defeat evil , by leading mankind , beyond the state wherein they are sinless through ignorance , to that in which they are virtuous through wisdom . Jupiter punished the temerity of the Titan by chaining him to a rock of Caucasus , and causing a vulture to devour his still-renewed heart . There was a prophecy afloat in heaven portending the fall of Jove , the secret of averting which was known only to Prometheus ; and the god offered freedom from torture on condition of its being communicated to him . According to the mythological story , this referred to the offspring of Thetis , who was destined to be greater than his father . Prometheus at last bought pardon for his crime of enriching mankind with his gifts , by revealing the prophecy . Hercules killed the vulture , and set him free ; and Thetis was married to Peleus , the father of Achilles .</p>
    <p n="488">Shelley adapted the catastrophe of this story to his peculiar views . The son greater than his father , born of the nuptials of Jupiter and Thetis , was to dethrone Evil , and bring back a happier reign than that of Saturn . Prometheus defies the power of his enemy , and endures centuries of torture ; till the hour arrives when Jove , blind to the real event , but darkly guessing that some great good to himself will flow , espouses Thetis . At the moment , the Primal Power of the world drives him from his usurped throne , and Strength , in the person of Hercules , liberates Humanity , typified in Prometheus , from the tortures generated by evil done or suffered . Asia , one of the Oceanides , is the wife of Prometheus — she was , according to other mythological interpretations , the same as Venus and Nature . When the benefactor of mankind is liberated , Nature resumes the beauty of her prime , and is united to her husband , the emblem of the human race , in perfect and happy union . In the Fourth Act , the Poet gives further scope to his imagination , and idealizes the forms of creation — such as we know them , instead of such as they appeared to the Greeks . Maternal Earth , the mighty parent , is superseded by the Spirit of the Earth , the guide of our planet through the realms of sky ; while his fair and weaker companion and attendant , the Spirit of the Moon , receives bliss from the annihilation of Evil in the superior sphere .</p>
    <p n="489">Shelley develops , more particularly in the lyrics of this drama , his abstruse and imaginative theories with regard to the Creation . It requires a mind as subtle and penetrating as his own to understand the mystic meanings scattered throughout the poem . They elude the ordinary reader by their abstraction and delicacy of distinction , but they are far from vague . It was his design to write prose metaphysical essays on the nature of Man , which would have served to explain much of what is obscure in his poetry ; a few scattered fragments of observations and remarks alone remain . He considered these philosophical views of Mind and Nature to be instinct with the intensest spirit of poetry .</p>
    <p n="490">More popular poets clothe the ideal with familiar and sensible imagery . Shelley loved to idealize the real — to gift the mechanism of the material universe with a soul and a voice , and to bestow such also on the most delicate and abstract emotions and thoughts of the mind . Sophocles was his great master in this species of imagery .</p>
    <p n="491">I find in one of his manuscript books some remarks on a line in the “ Oedipus Tyrannus ” , which show at once the critical subtlety of Shelley 's mind , and explain his apprehension of those ‘ minute and remote distinctions of feeling , whether relative to external nature or the living beings which surround us , ’ which he pronounces , in the letter quoted in the note to the “ Revolt of Islam ” , to comprehend all that is sublime in man .</p>
    <p n="492">‘ In the Greek Shakespeare , Sophocles , we find the image ,</p>
    <p n="493">Pollas d ’ odous elthonta phrontidos planois :</p>
    <p n="494">a line of almost unfathomable depth of poetry ; yet how simple are the images in which it is arrayed !</p>
    <p n="495">“ Coming to many ways in the wanderings of careful thought . ”</p>
    <p n="496">If the words odous and planois had not been used , the line might have been explained in a metaphorical instead of an absolute sense , as we say “ WAYS and means , ” and “ wanderings ” for error and confusion . But they meant literally paths or roads , such as we tread with our feet ; and wanderings , such as a man makes when he loses himself in a desert , or roams from city to city — as Oedipus , the speaker of this verse , was destined to wander , blind and asking charity . What a picture does this line suggest of the mind as a wilderness of intricate paths , wide as the universe , which is here made its symbol ; a world within a world which he who seeks some knowledge with respect to what he ought to do searches throughout , as he would search the external universe for some valued thing which was hidden from him upon its surface . ’</p>
    <p n="497">In reading Shelley 's poetry , we often find similar verses , resembling , but not imitating the Greek in this species of imagery ; for , though he adopted the style , he gifted it with that originality of form and colouring which sprung from his own genius .</p>
    <p n="498">In the “ Prometheus Unbound ” , Shelley fulfils the promise quoted from a letter in the Note on the “ Revolt of Islam ” . ( While correcting the proof-sheets of that poem , it struck me that the poet had indulged in an exaggerated view of the evils of restored despotism ; which , however injurious and degrading , were less openly sanguinary than the triumph of anarchy , such as it appeared in France at the close of the last century . But at this time a book , “ Scenes of Spanish Life ” , translated by Lieutenant Crawford from the German of Dr. Huber , of Rostock , fell into my hands . The account of the triumph of the priests and the serviles , after the French invasion of Spain in 1823 , bears a strong and frightful resemblance to some of the descriptions of the massacre of the patriots in the “ Revolt of Islam ” . ) The tone of the composition is calmer and more majestic , the poetry more perfect as a whole , and the imagination displayed at once more pleasingly beautiful and more varied and daring . The description of the Hours , as they are seen in the cave of Demogorgon , is an instance of this — it fills the mind as the most charming picture — we long to see an artist at work to bring to our view the</p>
    <p n="499">‘ cars drawn by rainbow-winged steeds Which trample the dim winds : in each there stands A wild-eyed charioteer urging their flight . Some look behind , as fiends pursued them there , And yet I see no shapes but the keen stars : Others , with burning eyes , lean forth , and drink With eager lips the wind of their own speed , As if the thing they loved fled on before , And now , even now , they clasped it . Their bright locks Stream like a comet 's flashing hair : they all Sweep onward . ’</p>
    <p n="500">Through the whole poem there reigns a sort of calm and holy spirit of love ; it soothes the tortured , and is hope to the expectant , till the prophecy is fulfilled , and Love , untainted by any evil , becomes the law of the world .</p>
    <p n="501">England had been rendered a painful residence to Shelley , as much by the sort of persecution with which in those days all men of liberal opinions were visited , and by the injustice he had lately endured in the Court of Chancery , as by the symptoms of disease which made him regard a visit to Italy as necessary to prolong his life . An exile , and strongly impressed with the feeling that the majority of his countrymen regarded him with sentiments of aversion such as his own heart could experience towards none , he sheltered himself from such disgusting and painful thoughts in the calm retreats of poetry , and built up a world of his own — with the more pleasure , since he hoped to induce some one or two to believe that the earth might become such , did mankind themselves consent . The charm of the Roman climate helped to clothe his thoughts in greater beauty than they had ever worn before . And , as he wandered among the ruins made one with Nature in their decay , or gazed on the Praxitelean shapes that throng the Vatican , the Capitol , and the palaces of Rome , his soul imbibed forms of loveliness which became a portion of itself . There are many passages in the “ Prometheus ” which show the intense delight he received from such studies , and give back the impression with a beauty of poetical description peculiarly his own . He felt this , as a poet must feel when he satisfies himself by the result of his labours ; and he wrote from Rome , ‘ My “ Prometheus Unbound ” is just finished , and in a month or two I shall send it . It is a drama , with characters and mechanism of a kind yet unattempted ; and I think the execution is better than any of my former attempts . ’</p>
    <p n="502">I may mention , for the information of the more critical reader , that the verbal alterations in this edition of “ Prometheus ” are made from a list of errata written by Shelley himself .</p>
