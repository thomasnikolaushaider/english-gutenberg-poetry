    <docImprint>Feb. 3 ,<date>1809</date>. ADVERTISEMENT . Before this book was printed , I thoughtlessly concluded there must be a preface ; but , on consideration , see no particular purpose it would answer , and gladly decline a task I should have undertaken with much timidity and reluctance . All I feel necessary to premise , is , that the tale in the Old Shepherd 's Recollections is founded on an event which happened in Ireland ; and that last spring I suppressed the song ending in page 65 [ The Old Man 's Farewell ] , some time after it had been in the hands of the composer , from meeting accidentally with a quotation in a magazine that resembled it .</docImprint>

    <head>THE OLD FISHERMAN .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ My bosom is chill 'd with the cold ,</l>
     <l n="2">My limbs their lost vigour deplore !</l>
     <l n="3">Alas ! to the lonely and old ,</l>
     <l n="4">Hope warbles her promise no more !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">‘ Worn out with the length of my way ,</l>
     <l n="6">I must rest me awhile on the beach ,</l>
     <l n="7">To feel the salt dash of the spray ,</l>
     <l n="8">If haply so far it may reach .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">‘ As the white-foaming billows arise ,</l>
     <l n="10">I reflect on the days that are past ,</l>
     <l n="11">When the pride of my strength could despise</l>
     <l n="12">The keen-driving force of the blast .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">‘ Though the heavens might menace on high ,</l>
     <l n="14">I would still push my vessel from shore ;</l>
     <l n="15">At my calling undauntedly ply ,</l>
     <l n="16">And sing as I handled the oar .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">‘ When fortune rewarded my toil ,</l>
     <l n="18">And my nets , deeply-laden , I drew ,</l>
     <l n="19">I hurried me home with the spoil ,</l>
     <l n="20">And its inmates rejoic 'd at the view .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">‘ Though the winds and the waves were perverse ,</l>
     <l n="22">I was sure to be welcom 'd with glee ;</l>
     <l n="23">My presence the cares would disperse ,</l>
     <l n="24">That were only awaken 'd for me .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">‘ Whether weary , with toiling in vain ,</l>
     <l n="26">Or gay , from abundant success ,</l>
     <l n="27">I heard the same blessing again ,—</l>
     <l n="28">I met the same tender caress :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">‘ I fancied the perils repay 'd ,</l>
     <l n="30">That could such affection ensure ;</l>
     <l n="31">By fondness and gratitude sway 'd ,</l>
     <l n="32">I was eager to dare and endure .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">‘ My cot did each comfort contain ,</l>
     <l n="34">And that gave my bosom delight ;</l>
     <l n="35">When drench 'd by the winterly rain ,</l>
     <l n="36">I watch 'd in my vessel at night .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">‘ But , alas ! from the tyrant , Disease ,</l>
     <l n="38">What love or what caution can save !</l>
     <l n="39">A fever , more harsh than the seas ,</l>
     <l n="40">Consign 'd my poor wife to the grave .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="41">‘ My children , so tenderly rear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="42">And pining for want of her care ,</l>
     <l n="43">Though more by my sorrows endear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="44">Could not rescue my heart from despair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="45">‘ I tempted the dangers of night ,</l>
     <l n="46">And still labour 'd hard at the oar ,</l>
     <l n="47">My sufferings appear 'd to be light ,</l>
     <l n="48">But I suffer 'd with pleasure no more .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="49">‘ And yet , when some seasons had roll 'd ,</l>
     <l n="50">I seem 'd to awaken anew ;</l>
     <l n="51">My children I lov 'd to behold ,</l>
     <l n="52">How tall and how comely they grew .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="53">‘ My boy became hardy and bold ,</l>
     <l n="54">His spirit was buoyant and free ;</l>
     <l n="55">And , as I grew thoughtful and old ,</l>
     <l n="56">Was loud and oppressive to me .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="57">‘ But the girl , like a bird in the bower ,</l>
     <l n="58">Awaken 'd my hope and my pride ;</l>
     <l n="59">She won on my heart ev'ry hour ,</l>
     <l n="60">And I could not the preference hide .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="61">‘ I mark 'd the address and the care ,</l>
     <l n="62">The manner endearing and mild ,</l>
     <l n="63">Not dreaming those qualities rare</l>
     <l n="64">Were to murther the peace of my child :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="65">‘ That grandeur would ever descend</l>
     <l n="66">To seek for so lowly a bride ,</l>
     <l n="67">Or his fair one , a lover pretend ,</l>
     <l n="68">From all she held dear to divide :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="69">‘ That beauty was priz 'd like a gem ,</l>
     <l n="70">Expected to dazzle and shine ,</l>
     <l n="71">Whose value the world would contemn ,</l>
     <l n="72">Unless trac 'd to some Indian mine :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="73">‘ Alas ! hapless girl ! had I known</l>
     <l n="74">Thou hadst learnt to repine at thy lot ;</l>
     <l n="75">That splendour and rank were thy own ,</l>
     <l n="76">Thy home and thy father forgot :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="77">‘ That lore and ambition assail 'd ,</l>
     <l n="78">Thou hadst left us , whatever befel !</l>
     <l n="79">My pardon and prayers had prevail 'd ,</l>
     <l n="80">I had blest thee , and bade thee farewel !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="81">‘ With thy husband , from this happy clime ,</l>
     <l n="82">I had seen thee for ever depart !</l>
     <l n="83">Still hoping affection and time</l>
     <l n="84">Might soften the pride of his heart :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="85">‘ That a moment perhaps would arise ,</l>
     <l n="86">When , fondling a child on the knee ,</l>
     <l n="87">He might read , in its innocent eyes</l>
     <l n="88">A lesson of pity for me .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="89">‘ But lips , which till then never said</l>
     <l n="90">A word to cause any one pain ,</l>
     <l n="91">Inform 'd me , when reason had fled ,</l>
     <l n="92">Of a conflict it could not sustain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="93">‘ And he , who had wish 'd to conceal</l>
     <l n="94">That the woman he lov 'd had been poor ,</l>
     <l n="95">Began all his folly to feel ,</l>
     <l n="96">When the victim could hearken no more .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="97">‘ Yet still for himself did he mourn ,</l>
     <l n="98">And , indignant , I fled from the view :</l>
     <l n="99">For my wrongs were not easily borne ,</l>
     <l n="100">And my anger was hard to subdue .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="101">‘ One prop , one sole comfort , remain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="102">Who saw me o'erladen with grief ,</l>
     <l n="103">Who saw ( though I never complain 'd )</l>
     <l n="104">My heart was too sick for relief .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="105">‘ One , who always attentive and dear ,</l>
     <l n="106">Every effort exerted to please ,</l>
     <l n="107">My desolate prospect to cheer ,</l>
     <l n="108">To study my health and my ease .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="109">‘ For his was each toil and each care ,</l>
     <l n="110">The due observations to keep ;</l>
     <l n="111">To sit watching amid the night air ,</l>
     <l n="112">And fancy his father asleep .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="113">‘ Yet , dejected , and sadly forlorn ,</l>
     <l n="114">I dar 'd in my heart to repine ,—</l>
     <l n="115">To lament that I ever was born ,</l>
     <l n="116">Though such worth and affection were mine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="30">
     <l n="117">‘ Alas ! I was destin 'd to know ,</l>
     <l n="118">However intense my despair ,</l>
