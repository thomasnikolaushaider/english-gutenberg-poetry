    <head>Preface</head>
    <p n="1">When I first saw Mr. Osgood 's beautiful illustrated edition of The Lady of the Lake , I asked him to let me use some of the cuts in a cheaper annotated edition for school and household use ; and the present volume is the result .</p>
    <p n="2">The text of the poem has given me unexpected trouble . When I edited some of Gray 's poems several years ago , I found that they had not been correctly printed for more than half a century ; but in the case of Scott I supposed that the text of Black 's so-called “ Author 's Edition ” could be depended upon as accurate . Almost at the start , however , I detected sundry obvious misprints in one of the many forms in which this edition is issued , and an examination of others showed that they were as bad in their way . The “ Shilling ” issue was no worse than the costly illustrated one of 1853 , which had its own assortment of slips of the type . No two editions that I could obtain agreed exactly in their readings . I tried in vain to find a copy of the editio princeps ( 1810 ) in Cambridge and Boston , but succeeded in getting one through a London bookseller . This I compared , line by line , with the Edinburgh edition of 1821 ( from the Harvard Library ) , with Lockhart 's first edition , the “ Globe ” edition , and about a dozen others English and American . I found many misprints and corruptions in all except the edition of 1821 , and a few even in that . For instance in i . 217 Scott wrote “ Found in each cliff a narrow bower , ” and it is so printed in the first edition ; but in every other that I have seen “ cliff ” appears in place of clift ,, to the manifest injury of the passage . In ii . 685 , every edition that I have seen since that of 1821 has “ I meant not all my heart might say , ” which is worse than nonsense , the correct reading being “ my heat . ” In vi . 396 , the Scottish “ boune ” ( though it occurs twice in other parts of the poem ) has been changed to “ bound ” in all editions since 1821 ; and , eight lines below , the old word “ barded ” has become “ barbed . ” Scores of similar corruptions are recorded in my Notes , and need not be cited here .</p>
    <p n="3">I have restored the reading of the first edition , except in cases where I have no doubt that the later reading is the poet 's own correction or alteration . There are obvious misprints in the first edition which Scott himself overlooked ( see on ii . 115 , 217 ,, Vi . 527 , etc . ) , and it is sometimes difficult to decide whether a later reading — a change of a plural to a singular , or like trivial variation — is a misprint or the author 's correction of an earlier misprint . I have done the best I could , with the means at my command , to settle these questions , and am at least certain that the text as I give it is nearer right than in any edition since 1821 As all the variae lectiones are recorded in the Notes , the reader who does not approve of the one I adopt can substitute that which he prefers .</p>
    <p n="4">I have retained all Scott 's Notes ( a few of them have been somewhat abridged ) and all those added by Lockhart .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>My own I have made as concise as possible . There are , of course , many of them which many of my readers will not need , but I think there are none that may not be of service , or at least of interest , to some of them ; and I hope that no one will turn to them for help without finding it .</p>
    <p n="5">Scott is much given to the use of Elizabethan words and constructions , and I have quoted many “ parallelisms ” from Shakespeare and his contemporaries . I believe I have referred to my edition of Shakespeare in only a single instance ( on iii . 17 ) , but teachers and others who have that edition will find many additional illustrations in the Notes on the passages cited .</p>

    <docImprint>While correcting the errors of former editors , I may have overlooked some of my own . I am already indebted to the careful proofreaders of the University Press for the detection of occasional slips in quotations or references ; and I shall be very grateful to my readers for a memorandum of any others that they may discover .<settlement>Cambridge</settlement>, June 23 ,<date>1883</date>.. ARGUMENT . The scene of the following Poem is laid chiefly in the vicinity of Loch Katrine , in the Western Highlands of Perthshire . The time of Action includes Six Days , and the transactions of each Day occupy a Canto .</docImprint>

     <l n="17">Fair dames and crested chiefs attention bowed ;</l>

     <l n="24">Though harsh and faint , and soon to die away ,</l>

Yet , witness every quaking limb , My sunken pulse , mine eyeballs dim , My soul with harrowing anguish torn , This for my Chieftain have I borne !— The shapes that sought my fearful couch A human tongue may ne'er avouch ; No mortal man — save he , who , bred Between the living and the dead , Is gifted beyond nature 's law Had e'er survived to say he saw . At length the fateful answer came In characters of living flame ! Not spoke in word , nor blazed in scroll , But borne and branded on my soul :— WHICH SPILLS THE FOREMOST FOEMAN 'S LIFE , THAT PARTY CONQUERS IN THE STRIFE . ’</p>

    <head>NOTES .</head>
    <p n="1">Introduction .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="dedication">
    <p>The Lady of the Lake was first published in 1810 , when Scott was thirty-nine , and it was dedicated to “ the most noble John James , Marquis of Abercorn . ” Eight thousand copies were sold between June 2d and September 22d , 1810 , and repeated editions were subsequently called for . In 1830 , the following “ Introduction ” was prefixed to the poem by the author :— After the success of Marmion , I felt inclined to exclaim with Ulysses in the Odyssey : [ Greek Letters ] Odys . X . 5 . “ One venturous game my hand has won to-day — Another , gallants , yet remains to play . ” The ancient manners , the habits and customs of the aboriginal race by whom the Highlands of Scotland were inhabited , had always appeared to me peculiarly adapted to poetry . The change in their manners , too , had taken place almost within my own time , or at least I had learned many particulars concerning the ancient state of the Highlands from the old men of the last generation . I had always thought the old Scottish Gael highly adapted for poetical composition . The feuds and political dissensions which , half a century earlier , would have rendered the richer and wealthier part of the kingdom indisposed to countenance a poem , the scene of which was laid in the Highlands , were now sunk in the generous compassion which the English , more than any other nation , feel for the misfortunes of an honourable foe . The Poems of Ossian had by their popularity sufficiently shown that , if writings on Highland subjects were qualified to interest the reader , mere national prejudices were , in the present day , very unlikely to interfere with their success . I had also read a great deal , seen much , and heard more , of that romantic country where I was in the habit of spending some time every autumn ; and the scenery of Lock Katrine was connected with the recollection of many a dear friend and merry expedition of former days . This poem , the action of which lay among scenes so beautiful and so deeply imprinted on my recollections , was a labour of love , and it was no less so to recall the manners and incidents introduced . The frequent custom of James IV ., and particularly of James V ., to walk through their kingdom in disguise , afforded me the hint of an incident which never fails to be interesting if managed with the slightest address or dexterity . I may now confess , however , that the employment , though attended with great pleasure , was not without its doubts and anxieties . A lady , to whom I was nearly related , and with whom I lived , during her whole life , on the most brotherly terms of affection , was residing with me at the time when the work was in progress , and used to ask me , what I could possibly do to rise so early in the morning ( that happening to be the most convenient to me for composition ) . At last I told her the subject of my meditations ; and I can never forget the anxiety and affection expressed in her reply . “ Do not be so rash , ” she said , “ my dearest cousin .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>You are already popular ,— more so , perhaps , than you yourself will believe , or than even I , or other partial friends , can fairly allow to your merit . You stand high ,— do not rashly attempt to climb higher , and incur the risk of a fall ; for , depend upon it , a favourite will not be permitted even to stumble with impunity . ” I replied to this affectionate expostulation in the words of Montrose ,— “ ‘ He either fears his fate too much , Or his deserts are small , Who dares not put it to the touch To gain or lose it all . ’ “ If I fail , ” I said , for the dialogue is strong in my recollection , “ it is a sign that I ought never to have succeeded , and I will write prose for life : you shall see no change in my temper , nor will I eat a single meal the worse . But if I succeed , ‘ Up with the bonnie blue bonnet , The dirk , and the feather , and a ’ ! ' ” Afterwards I showed my affectionate and anxious critic the first canto of the poem , which reconciled her to my imprudence . Nevertheless , although I answered thus confidently , with the obstinacy often said to be proper to those who bear my surname , I acknowledge that my confidence was considerably shaken by the warning of her excellent taste and unbiased friendship . Nor was I much comforted by her retraction of the unfavourable judgment , when I recollected how likely a natural partiality was to effect that change of opinion . In such cases , affection rises like a light on the canvas , improves any favourable tints which it formerly exhibited , and throws its defects into the shade . I remember that about the same time a friend started in to “ heeze up my hope , ” like the “ sportsman with his cutty gun , ” in the old song . He was bred a farmer , but a man of powerful understanding , natural good taste , and warm poetical feeling , perfectly competent to supply the wants of an imperfect or irregular education . He was a passionate admirer of field-sports , which we often pursued together . As this friend happened to dine with me at Ashestiel one day , I took the opportunity of reading to him the first canto of The Lady of the Lake , in order to ascertain the effect the poem was likely to produce upon a person who was but too favourable a representative of readers at large . It is of course to be supposed that I determined rather to guide my opinion by what my friend might appear to feel , than by what he might think fit to say . His reception of my recitation , or prelection , was rather singular . He placed his hand across his brow , and listened with great attention through the whole account of the stag-hunt , till the dogs threw themselves into the lake to follow their master , who embarks with Ellen Douglas . He then started up with a sudden exclamation , struck his hand on the table , and declared , in a voice of censure calculated for the occasion , that the dogs must have been totally ruined by being permitted to take the water after such a severe chase . I own I was much encouraged by the species of revery which had possessed so zealous a follower of the sports of the ancient Nimrod , who had been completely surprised out of all doubts of the reality of the tale . Another of his remarks gave me less pleasure . He detected the identity of the King with the wandering knight , Fitz-James , when he winds his bugle to summon his attendants . He was probably thinking of the lively , but somewhat licentious , old ballad , in which the denouement of a royal intrigue takes place as follows : “ He took a bugle frae his side , He blew both loud and shrill , And four and twenty belted knights Came skipping over the hill ; Then he took out a little knife , Let a ’ his duddies fa ’ , And he was the brawest gentleman That was amang them a ’ . And we 'll go no more a roving , ” etc . This discovery , as Mr. Pepys says of the rent in his camlet cloak , was but a trifle , yet it troubled me ; and I was at a good deal of pains to efface any marks by which I thought my secret could be traced before the conclusion , when I relied on it with the same hope of producing effect , with which the Irish post-boy is said to reserve a “ trot for the avenue . ” I took uncommon pains to verify the accuracy of the local circumstances of this story . I recollect , in particular , that to ascertain whether I was telling a probable tale , I went into Perthshire , to see whether King James could actually have ridden from the banks of Loch Vennachar to Stirling Castle within the time supposed in the poem , and had the pleasure to satisfy myself that it was quite practicable . After a considerable delay , The Lady of the Lake appeared in June , 1810 ; and its success was certainly so extraordinary as to induce me for the moment to conclude that I had at last fixed a nail in the proverbially inconstant wheel of Fortune , whose stability in behalf of an individual who had so boldly courted her favours for three successive times had not as yet been shaken . I had attained , perhaps , that degree of reputation at which prudence , or certainly timidity , would have made a halt , and discontinued efforts by which I was far more likely to diminish my fame than to increase it . But , as the celebrated John Wilkes is said to have explained to his late Majesty , that he himself , amid his full tide of popularity , was never a Wilkite , so I can , with honest truth , exculpate myself from having been at any time a partisan of my own poetry , even when it was in the highest fashion with the million . It must not be supposed that I was either so ungrateful , or so superabundantly candid , as to despise or scorn the value of those whose voice had elevated me so much higher than my own opinion told me I deserved . I felt , on the contrary , the more grateful to the public , as receiving that from partiality to me , which I could not have claimed from merit ; and I endeavoured to deserve the partiality , by continuing such exertions as I was capable of for their amusement . It may be that I did not , in this continued course of scribbling , consult either the interest of the public or my own . But the former had effectual means of defending themselves , and could , by their coldness , sufficiently check any approach to intrusion ; and for myself , I had now for several years dedicated my hours so much to literary labour that I should have felt difficulty in employing myself otherwise ; and so , like Dogberry , I generously bestowed all my tediousness on the public , comforting myself with the reflection that , if posterity should think me undeserving of the favour with which I was regarded by my contemporaries , “ they could not but say I had the crown , ” and had enjoyed for a time that popularity which is so much coveted . I conceived , however , that I held the distinguished situation I had obtained , however unworthily , rather like the champion of pugilism ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>on the condition of being always ready to show proofs of my skill , than in the manner of the champion of chivalry , who performs his duties only on rare and solemn occasions . I was in any case conscious that I could not long hold a situation which the caprice , rather than the judgment , of the public , had bestowed upon me , and preferred being deprived of my precedence by some more worthy rival , to sinking into contempt for my indolence , and losing my reputation by what Scottish lawyers call the negative prescription . Accordingly , those who choose to look at the Introduction to Rokeby , will be able to trace the steps by which I declined as a poet to figure as a novelist ; as the ballad says , Queen Eleanor sunk at Charing Cross to rise again at Queenhithe . It only remains for me to say that , during my short pre-eminence of popularity , I faithfully observed the rules of moderation which I had resolved to follow before I began my course as a man of letters . If a man is determined to make a noise in the world , he is as sure to encounter abuse and ridicule , as he who gallops furiously through a village must reckon on being followed by the curs in full cry . Experienced persons know that in stretching to flog the latter , the rider is very apt to catch a bad fall ; nor is an attempt to chastise a malignant critic attended with less danger to the author . On this principle , I let parody , burlesque , and squibs find their own level ; and while the latter hissed most fiercely , I was cautious never to catch them up , as schoolboys do , to throw them back against the naughty boy who fired them off , wisely remembering that they are in such cases apt to explode in the handling . Let me add , that my reign<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>( since Byron has so called it ) was marked by some instances of good-nature as well as patience . I never refused a literary person of merit such services in smoothing his way to the public as were in my power ; and I had the advantage , rather an uncommon one with our irritable race , to enjoy general favour without incurring permanent ill-will , so far as is known to me , among any of my contemporaries . W. S . Abbotsford , April , 1830 . Our limits do not permit us to add any extended selections from the many critical notices of the poem . The verdict of Jeffrey , in the Edinburgh Review , on its first appearance , has been generally endorsed :— “ Upon the whole , we are inclined to think more highly of The Lady of the Lake than of either of its author 's former publications [ the Lay and Marmion ] . We are more sure , however , that it has fewer faults than that it has greater beauties ; and as its beauties bear a strong resemblance to those with which the public has been already made familiar in these celebrated works , we should not be surprised if its popularity were less splendid and remarkable . For our own parts , however , we are of opinion that it will be oftener read hereafter than either of them ; and that , if it had appeared first in the series , their reception would have been less favourable than that which it has experienced . It is more polished in its diction , and more regular in its versification ; the story is constructed with infinitely more skill and address ; there is a greater proportion of pleasing and tender passages , with much less antiquarian detail ; and , upon the whole , a larger variety of characters , more artfully and judiciously contrasted . There is nothing so fine , perhaps , as the battle in Marmion , or so picturesque as some of the scattered sketches in the Lay ; but there is a richness and a spirit in the whole piece which does not pervade either of those poems ,— a profusion of incident and a shifting brilliancy of colouring that reminds us of the witchery of Ariosto , and a constant elasticity and occasional energy which seem to belong more peculiarly to the author now before us . ” Canto First . Each canto is introduced by one or more Spenserian stanzas ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>forming a kind of prelude to it . Those prefixed to the first canto serve as an introduction to the whole poem , which is “ inspired by the spirit of the old Scottish minstrelsy . ” 2 . Witch-elm . The broad-leaved or wych elm ( Ulmus montana ) , indigenous to Scotland . Forked branches of the tree were used in the olden time as divining-rods , and riding switches from it were supposed to insure good luck on a journey . In the closing stanzas of the poem ( vi . 846 ) it is called the “ wizard elm . ” Tennyson ( In Memoriam , 89 ) refers to “ Witch-elms that counterchange the floor Of this flat lawn with dusk and bright . ” Saint Fillan was a Scotch abbot of the seventh century who became famous as a saint . He had two springs , which appear to be confounded by some editors of the poem . One was at the eastern end of Loch Earn , where the pretty modern village of St. Fillans now stands , under the shadow of Dun Fillan , or St. Fillan 's Hills , six hundred feet high , on the top of which the saint used to say his prayers , as the marks of his knees in the rock still testify to the credulous . The other spring is at another village called St. Fillans , nearly thirty miles to the westward , just outside the limits of our map , on the road to Tyndrum . In this Holy Pool , as it is called , insane folk were dipped with certain ceremonies , and then left bound all night in the open air . If they were found loose the next morning , they were supposed to have been cured . This treatment was practised as late as 1790 , according to Pennant , who adds that the patients were generally found in the morning relieved of their troubles — by death . Another writer , in 1843 , says that the pool is still visited , not by people of the vicinity , who have no faith in its virtue , but by those from distant places . Scott alludes to this spring in Marmion , i . 29 : “ Thence to Saint Fillan 's blessed well , Whose springs can frenzied dreams dispel , And the crazed brain restore . ” 3 . And down the fitful breeze , etc . The original MS. reads : “ And on the fitful breeze thy numbers flung , Till envious ivy , with her verdant ring , Mantled and muffled each melodious string ,— O Wizard Harp , still must thine accents sleep ? ” 10 . Caledon . Caledonia , the Roman name of Scotland . 14 . Each according pause . That is , each pause in the singing . In Marmion , ii . 11 , according is used of music that fills the intervals of other music : “ Soon as they neared his turrets strong , The maidens raised Saint Hilda 's song , And with the sea-wave and the wind Their voices , sweetly shrill , combined , And made harmonious close ; Then , answering from the sandy shore , Half-drowned amid the breakers ’ roar , According chorus rose . ” The MS. reads here : “ At each according pause thou spokest aloud Thine ardent sympathy sublime and high . ” 28 . The stag at eve had drunk his fill . The metre of the poem proper is iambic , that is , with the accent on the even syllables , and octosyllabic , or eight syllables to the line . 29 . Monan 's rill . St. Monan was a Scotch martyr of the fourth century . We can find no mention of any rill named for him . 31 . Glenartney . A valley to the north-east of Callander , with Benvoirlich ( which rises to the height of 3180 feet ) on the north , and Uam-Var ( see 53 below ) on the south , separating it from the valley of the Teith . It takes its name from the Artney , the stream flowing through it . 32 . His beacon red . The figure is an appropriate one in describing this region , where fires on the hill-tops were so often used as signals in the olden time . Cf . the Lay , iii . 379 : “ And soon a score of fires , I ween , From height , and hill , and cliff , were seen , Each with warlike tidings fraught ; Each from each the signal caught , ” etc . 34 . Deep-mouthed . Cf . Shakespeare , 1 Hen . VI . ii . 4 . 12 : “ Between two dogs , which hath the deeper mouth ; ” and T. of S. ind . 1 . 18 : “ the deep-mouthed brach ” ( that is , hound ) . The MS. reads : “ The bloodhound 's notes of heavy bass Resounded hoarsely up the pass . ” 35 . Resounded ... rocky . The poet often avails himself of “ apt alliteration 's artful aid , ” as here , and in the next two lines ; most frequently in pairs of words . 38 . As Chief , etc . Note here , as often , the simile put BEFORE that which it illustrates ,— an effective rhetorical , though not the logical , arrangement . 45 . Beamed frontlet . Antlered forehead . 46 . Adown . An instance of a purely poetical word , not admissible in prose . 49 . Chase . Here put for those engaged in the chase ; as in 101 and 171 , below . One of its regular meanings is the OBJECT of the chase , or the animal pursued . 53 . Uam-Var . “ Ua-Var , as the name is pronounced , or more properly Uaigh-mor , is a mountain to the north-east of the village of Callander , in Menteith , deriving its name , which signifies the great den , or cavern , from a sort of retreat among the rocks on the south side , said , by tradition , to have been the abode of a giant . In latter times , it was the refuge of robbers and banditti , who have been only extirpated within these forty or fifty years . Strictly speaking , this stronghold is not a cave , as the name would imply , but a sort of small enclosure , or recess , surrounded with large rocks and open above head . It may have been originally designed as a toil for deer , who might get in from the outside , but would find it difficult to return . This opinion prevails among the old sportsmen and deer-stalkers in the neighborhood ” ( Scott ) . 54 . Yelled . Note the emphatic force of the inversion , as in 59 below . Cf . 38 above . Opening . That is , barking on view or scent of the game ; a hunting term . Cf . Shakespeare , M. W. iv . 2 . 209 : “ If I bark out thus upon no trail never trust me when I open again . ” The description of the echo which follows is very spirited . 66 . Cairn . Literally , a heap of stones ; here put poetically for the rocky point which the falcon takes as a look-out . 69 . Hurricane . A metaphor for the wild rush of the hunt . 71 . Linn . Literally , a deep pool ; but often = cataract , as in Bracklinn , ii . 270 below ( cf . vi . 488 ) , and sometimes = precipice . 73 . On the lone wood . Note the musical variation in the measure here ; the 1st , 3d , and 4th syllables being accented instead of the 2d and 4th . It is occasionally introduced into iambic metre with admirable effect . Cf . 85 and 97 below . 76 . The cavern , etc . See on 53 above . 80 . Perforce . A poetical word . See on 46 above . 84 . Shrewdly . Severely , keenly ; a sense now obsolete . Shrewd originally meant evil , mischievous . Cf . Shakespeare , A. Y. L. v. 4 . 179 , where it is said that those “ That have endur 'd shrewd days and nights with us Shall share the good of our returned fortune . ” In Chaucer ( Tale of Melibocus ) we find , “ The prophete saith : Flee shrewdnesse , and do goodnesse ” ( referring to Ps . xxxiv . 14 ) . 89 . Menteith . The district in the southwestern part of Perthshire , watered by the Teith . 91 . Mountain and meadow , etc . See on 35 above . Moss is used in the North-of-England sense of a boggy or peaty district , like the famous Chat Moss between Liverpool and Manchester . 93 . Lochard . Loch Ard is a beautiful lakelet , about five miles south of Loch Katrine . On its eastern side is the scene of Helen Macgregor 's skirmish with the King 's troops in Rob Roy ; and near its head , on the northern side , is a waterfall , which is the original of Flora MacIvor 's favorite retreat in Waverley . Aberfoyle is a village about a mile and a half to the east of the lake . 95 . Loch Achray . A lake between Loch Katrine and Loch Vennachar , lying just beyond the pass of the Trosachs . 97 . Benvenue . A mountain , 2386 feet in height , on the southern side of Loch Katrine . 98 . With the hope . The MS. has “ with the THOUGHT , ” and “ flying HOOF ” in the next line . 102 . ‘ Twere . It would be . Cf . Shakespeare , Macb . ii . 2 . 73 : “ To know my deed , ‘ t were best not know myself . ” 103 . Cambusmore . The estate of a family named Buchanan , whom Scott frequently visited in his younger days . It is about two miles from Callander , on the wooded banks of the Keltie , a tributary of the Teith . 105 . Benledi . A mountain , 2882 feet high , northwest from Callander . The name is said to mean “ Mountain of God . ” 106 . Bochastle 's heath . A moor between the east end of Loch Vennachar and Callander . See also on v. 298 below . 107 . The flooded Teith . The Teith is formed by streams from Loch Voil and from Loch Katrine ( by way of Loch Achray and Loch Vennachar ) , which unite at Callander . It joins the Forth near Stirling . 111 . Vennachar . As the map shows , this “ Lake of the Fair Valley ” is the most eastern of the three lakes around which the scenery of the poem lies . It is about five miles long and a mile and a half wide . 112 . The Brigg of Turk . This brig , or bridge ( cf . Burns 's poem of The Brigs of Ayr ) , is over a stream that comes down from Glenfinlas and flows into the one connecting Lochs Achray and Vennachar . According to Graham , it is “ the scene of the death of a wild boar famous in Celtic tradition . ” 114 . Unbated . Cf . Shakespeare , M. of V. ii . 6 . 11 : “ Where is the horse that doth untread again His tedious measures with the unbated fire That he did pace them first ? ” 115 . Scourge and steel . Whip and spur . Steel is often used for the sword ( as in v. 239 below : “ foeman worthy of their steel ” ) , the figure being of the same sort as here — “ the material put for the thing made of it . ” Cf . v. 479 below . 117 . Embossed . An old hunting term . George Turbervile , in his Noble Art of Venerie or Hunting ( A. D. 1576 ) , says : “ When the hart is foamy at the mouth , we say , that he is emboss 'd . ” Cf . Shakespeare , T. of S. ind . 1 . 17 : “ Brach Merriman , the poor cur , is emboss 'd ; ” and A. and C. iv . 13 . 3 : “ the boar of Thessaly Was never so emboss 'd . ” 120 . Saint Hubert 's breed . Scott quotes Turbervile here : “ The hounds which we call Saint Hubert 's hounds are commonly all blacke , yet neuertheless , the race is so mingled at these days , that we find them of all colours . These are the hounds which the abbots of St. Hubert haue always kept some of their race or kind , in honour or remembrance of the saint , which was a hunter with S. Eustace . Whereupon we may conceiue that ( by the grace of God ) all good huntsmen shall follow them into paradise . ” 127 . Quarry . The animal hunted ; another technical term . Shakespeare uses it in the sense of a heap of slaughtered game ; as in Cor . i . 1 . 202 : “ Would the nobility lay aside their ruth , And let me use my sword , I 'd make a quarry With thousands of these quarter 'd slaves , ” etc . Cf . Longfellow , Hiawatha : “ Seldom stoops the soaring vulture O'er his quarry in the desert . ” 130 . Stock . Tree-stump . Cf . Job , xiv . 8 . 133 . Turn to bay . Like stand at bay , etc ., a term used when the stag , driven to extremity , turns round and faces his pursuers . Cf . Shakespeare , 1 . Hen . VI . iv . 2 . 52 , where it is used figuratively ( as in vi . 525 below ): “ Turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel , And make the cowards stand aloof at bay ; ” and T. of S. v. 2 . 56 : “ ‘ T is thought your deer does hold you at a bay , ” etc . 137 . For the death-wound , etc . Scott has the following note here : “ When the stag turned to bay , the ancient hunter had the perilous task of going in upon , and killing or disabling , the desperate animal . At certain times of the year this was held particularly dangerous , a wound received from a stag 's horn being then deemed poisonous , and more dangerous than one from the tusks of a boar , as the old rhyme testifies : ‘ If thou be hurt with hart , it bring thee to thy bier , But barber 's hand will boar 's hurt heal , therefore thou need'st not fear . ’ At all times , however , the task was dangerous , and to be adventured upon wisely and warily , either by getting behind the stag while he was gazing on the hounds , or by watching an opportunity to gallop roundly in upon him , and kill him with the sword . See many directions to this purpose in the Booke of Hunting , chap . 41 . Wilson , the historian , has recorded a providential escape which befell him in the hazardous sport , while a youth , and follower of the Earl of Essex : ‘ Sir Peter Lee , of Lime , in Cheshire , invited my lord one summer to hunt the stagg . And having a great stagg in chase , and many gentlemen in the pursuit , the stag took soyle . And divers , whereof I was one , alighted , and stood with swords drawne , to have a cut at him , at his coming out of the water . The staggs there being wonderfully fierce and dangerous , made us youths more eager to be at him . But he escaped us all . And it was my misfortune to be hindered of my coming nere him , the way being sliperie , by a falle ; which gave occasion to some , who did not know mee , to speak as if I had falne for feare . Which being told mee , I left the stagg , and followed the gentleman who [ first ] spake it . But I found him of that cold temper , that it seems his words made an escape from him ; as by his denial and repentance it appeared . But this made mee more violent in the pursuit of the stagg , to recover my reputation . And I happened to be the only horseman in , when the dogs sett him up at bay ; and approaching near him on horsebacke , he broke through the dogs , and run at mee , and tore my horse 's side with his hornes , close by my thigh . Then I quitted my horse , and grew more cunning ( for the dogs had sette him up againe ) , stealing behind him with my sword , and cut his hamstrings ; and then got upon his back , and cut his throate ; which , as I was doing , the company came in , and blamed my rashness for running such a hazard ’ ( Peck 's Desiderata Curiosa , ii . 464 ) . ” 138 . Whinyard . A short stout sword or knife ; the same as the whinger of the Lay of Last Minstrel , v. 7 : “ And whingers , now in friendship bare The social meal to part and share , Had found a bloody sheath . ” 142 . Turned him . In Elizabethan , and still more in earlier English , personal pronouns were often used reflexively ; and this , like many other old constructions , is still used in poetry . 145 . Trosachs . “ The rough or bristled territory ” ( Graham ) ; the wild district between Lochs Katrine and Vennachar . The name is now especially applied to the pass between Lochs Katrine and Achray . 147 . Close couched . That is , as he lay close couched , or hidden . Such ellipses are common in poetry . 150 . Amain . With main , or full force . We still say “ with might and main . ” 151 . Chiding . Not a mere figurative use of chide as we now understand it ( cf . 287 below ) , but an example of the old sense of the word as applied to any oft-repeated noise . Shakespeare uses it of the barking of dogs in M. N. D. iv . 1 . 120 : “ never did I hear Such gallant chiding ; ” of the wind , as in A. Y. L. ii . 1 . 7 : “ And churlish chiding of the winter 's wind ; ” and of the sea , as in 1 Hen . IV . iii . 1 . 45 : “ the sea That chides the banks of England ; ” and Hen . VIII . iii . 2 . 197 : “ the chiding flood . ” 163 . The banks of Seine . James visited France in 1536 , and sued for the hand of Magdalen , daughter of Francis I . He married her the following spring , but she died a few months later . He then married Mary of Guise , whom he had doubtless seen while in France . 166 . Woe worth the chase . That is , woe be to it . This worth is from the A. S. weorthan , to become . Cf . Spenser , F. Q. ii . 6 . 32 : “ Wo worth the man , That first did teach the cursed steele to bight In his owne flesh , and make way to the living spright ! ” See also Ezek . xxx . 2 . 180 . And on the hunter , etc . The MS. reads : “ And on the hunter hied his pace , To meet some comrades of the chase ; ” and the 1st ed . retains “ pace ” and “ chase . ” 184 . The western waves , etc . This description of the Trosachs was written amid the scenery it delineates , in the summer of 1809 . The Quarterly Review ( May , 1810 ) says of the poet : “ He sees everything with a painter 's eye . Whatever he represents has a character of individuality , and is drawn with an accuracy and minuteness of discrimination which we are not accustomed to expect from mere verbal description . It is because Mr. Scott usually delineates those objects with which he is perfectly familiar that his touch is so easy , correct , and animated . The rocks , the ravines , and the torrents which he exhibits are not the imperfect sketches of a hurried traveller , but the finished studies of a resident artist . ” See also on 278 below . Ruskin ( Modern Painters , iii . 278 ) refers to “ the love of color ” as a leading element in Scott 's love of beauty . He might have quoted the present passage among the illustrations he adds . 195 . The native bulwarks , etc . The MS. has “ The mimic castles of the pass . ” 196 . The tower , etc . Cf . Gen. xi . 1-9 . 198 . The rocky . The 1st ed . has “ Their rocky , ” etc . 204 . Nor were , etc . The MS. reads : “ Nor were these mighty bulwarks bare . ” 208 . Dewdrop sheen . Not “ dewdrops sheen , ” or “ dewdrops ’ sheen , ” as sometimes printed . Sheen = shining , bright ; as in v. 10 below . Cf . Spenser , F. Q. ii . 1 . 10 : “ So faire and sheene ; ” Id . iii . 4 . 51 : “ in top of heaven sheene , ” etc . See Wb . The MS. has here : “ Bright glistening with the dewdrop sheen . ” 212 . Boon . Bountiful . Cf . Milton , P. L. iv . 242 : “ Flowers worthy of Paradise , which not nice art In beds and curious knots , but nature boon Pour 'd forth profuse on hill , and dale , and plain . ” See also P. L. ix . 793 : “ jocund and boon . ” 217 . Bower . In the old sense of chamber , lodging-place ; as in iv . 413 and vi . 218 below . Cf . Spenser , F. Q. iii . 1 . 58 : “ Eftesoones long waxen torches weren light Unto their bowres to guyden every guest . ” For clift (= cleft ) , the reading of the 1st ed . and unquestionably what Scott wrote , every other edition that we have seen reads “ cliff . ” 219 . Emblems of punishment and pride . See on iii . 19 below . 222 , 223 . Note the imperfect rhyme in breath and beneath . Cf . 224-25 , 256-57 , 435-36 , 445-46 below . Such instances are comparatively rare in Scott 's poetry . Some rhymes that appear to be imperfect are to be explained by peculiarities of Scottish pronunciation . See on 363 below . 227 . Shaltered . The MS. has “ scathed ; ” also “ rugged arms athwart the sky ” in 229 , and “ twinkling ” for glistening in 231 . The 1st ed . has “ scattered ” for shattered ; corrected in the Errata . 231 . Streamers . Of ivy or other vines . 238 . Affording , etc . The MS. reads : “ Affording scarce such breadth of flood As served to float the wild-duck 's brood . ” 247 . Emerging , etc . The MS. has “ Emerging dry-shod from the wood . ” 254 . And now , to issue from the glen , etc . “ Until the present road was made through the romantic pass which I have presumptuously attempted to describe in the preceding stanzas , there was no mode of issuing out of the defile called the Trosachs , excepting by a sort of ladder , composed of the branches and roots of trees ” ( Scott ) . 263 . Loch Katrine . In a note to The Fair Maid of Perth , Scott derives the name from the Catterans , or Highland robbers , that once infested the shores of the lake . Others make it “ the Lake of the Battle , ” in memory of some prehistoric conflict . 267 . Livelier . Because in motion ; like living gold above . 270 . Benvenue . See on 97 above . 271 . Down to . Most editions misprint “ down on . ” 272 . Confusedly . A trisyllable ; as in ii . 161 below , and in the Lay , iii . 337 : “ And helms and plumes , confusedly tossed . ” 274 . Wildering . Bewildering . Cf . Dryden , Aurungzebe , i . 1 : “ wilder 'd in the way , ” etc . See also 434 and v. 22 below . 275 . His ruined sides , etc . The MS. reads : “ His ruined sides and fragments hoar , While on the north to middle air . ” 277 . Ben-an . This mountain , 1800 feet high , is north of the Trosachs , separating that pass from Glenfinlas . 278 . From the steep , etc . The MS. reads : “ From the high promontory gazed The stranger , awe-struck and amazed . ” The Critical Review ( Aug. 1820 ) remarks of this portion of the poem ( 184 fol . ): “ Perhaps the art of landscape-painting in poetry has never been displayed in higher perfection than in these stanzas , to which rigid criticism might possibly object that the picture is somewhat too minute , and that the contemplation of it detains the traveller somewhat too long from the main purpose of his pilgrimage , but which it would be an act of the greatest injustice to break into fragments and present by piecemeal . Not so the magnificent scene which bursts upon the bewildered hunter as he emerges at length from the dell , and commands at one view the beautiful expanse of Loch Katrine . ” 281 . Churchman . In its old sense of one holding high office in the church . Cf . Shakespeare , 2 Hen . VI . i . 3 . 72 , where Cardinal Beaufort is called “ the imperious churchman , ” etc . 285 . Cloister . Monastery ; originally , the covered walk around the inner court of the building . 287 . Chide . Here , figuratively , in the modern sense . See in 151 above . 290 . Should lave . The 1st ed . has “ did lave , ” which is perhaps to be preferred . 294 . While the deep peal 's . For the measure , see on 73 above . 300 . To friendly feast , etc . The MS. has “ To hospitable feast and hall . ” 302 . Beshrew . May evil befall ( see on shrewdly , 84 above ) ; a mild imprecation , often used playfully and even tenderly . Cf . Shakespeare , 2 Hen . IV . ii . 3 . 45 : “ Beshrew your heart , Fair daughter , you do draw my spirits from me With new lamenting ancient oversights ! ” 305 . Some mossy bank , etc . The MS. reads : “ And hollow trunk of some old tree My chamber for the night must be . ” 313 . Highland plunderers . “ The clans who inhabited the romantic regions in the neighborhood of Loch Katrine were , even until a late period , much addicted to predatory excursions upon their Lowland neighbors ” ( Scott ) . 317 . Fall the worst . If the worst befall that can happen . Cf . Shakespeare , M. of V. i . 2 . 96 : “ an the worst fall that ever fell , I hope I shall make shift to go without him . ” 319 . But scarce again , etc . The MS. reads : “ The bugle shrill again he wound , And lo ! forth starting at the sound ; ” and below : “ A little skiff shot to the bay . The hunter left his airy stand , And when the boat had touched the sand , Concealed he stood amid the brake , To view this Lady of the Lake . ” 336 . Strain . The 1st ed . has a comma after strain , and a period after art in 340 . The ed . of 1821 points as in the text . 342 . Naiad . Water nymph . 343 . And ne'er did Grecian chisel , etc . The MS. reads : “ A finer form , a fairer face , Had never marble Nymph or Grace , That boasts the Grecian chisel 's trace ; ” and in 359 below , “ a stranger tongue . ” 353 . Measured mood . The formal manner required by court etiquette . 360 . Dear . This is the reading of the 1st ed . and almost every other that we have seen . We are inclined , however , to believe that Scott wrote “ clear . ” The facsimiles of his handwriting show that his d 's and cl 's might easily be confounded by a compositor . 363 . Snood . The fillet or ribbon with which the Scotch maidens bound their hair . See on iii . 114 below . It is the rich materials of snood , plaid , and brooch that betray her birth . The rhyme of plaid with maid and betrayed is not imperfect , the Scottish pronunciation of plaid being like our played . 385 . One only . For the inversion , cf . Shakespeare , J. C. i . 2 . 157 : “ When there is in it but one only man ; ” Goldsmith , D. V. 39 : “ One only master grasps the whole domain , ” etc . 393 . Awhile she paused , etc . The MS. reads : “ A space she paused , no answer came ,— ‘ Alpine , was thine the blast ? ’ the name Less resolutely uttered fell , The echoes could not catch the swell . ‘ Nor foe nor friend , ’ the stranger said , Advancing from the hazel shade . The startled maid , with hasty oar , Pushed her light shallop from the shore . ” and just below : “ So o'er the lake the swan would spring , Then turn to prune its ruffled wing . ” 404 . Prune . Pick out damaged feathers and arrange the plumage with the bill . Cf . Shakespeare , Cymb . v. 4 . 118 : “ his royal bird Prunes the immortal wing , ” etc . 408 . Wont . Are wont , or accustomed ; now used only in the participle . The form here is the past tense of the obsolete won , or wone , to dwell . The present is found in Milton , P. L. vii . 457 : “ As from his lair the wild beast , where he wons In forest wild , in thicket , brake , or den . ” Cf . Spenser , Virgil 's Gnat : “ Of Poets Prince , whether we woon beside Faire Xanthus sprincled with Chimaeras blood , Or in the woods of Astery abide ; ” and Colin Clouts Come Home Againe : “ I weened sure he was out God alone , And only woond in fields and forests here . ” See also iv . 278 and 298 below . 409 . Middle age . As James died at the age of thirty ( in 1542 ) , this is not strictly true , but the portrait in other respects is quite accurate . He was fond of going about disguised , and some of his freaks of this kind are pleasantly related in Scott 's Tales of a Grandfather . See on vi . 740 below . 425 . Slighting , etc . “ Treating lightly his need of food and shelter . ” 432 . At length . The 1st ed . has “ at last . ” 433 . That Highland halls were , etc . The MS. has “ Her father 's hall was , ” etc . 434 . Wildered . See on 274 above . 438 . A couch . That is , the heather for it . Cf . 666 below . 441 . Mere . Lake ; as in Windermere , etc . 443 . Rood . Cross , or crucifix . By the rood was a common oath ; so by the holy rood , as in Shakespeare , Rich . III . iii . 2 . 77 , iv . 4 . 165 . Cf . the name of Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh . See ii . 221 below . 451 . Romantic . The MS. has “ enchanting . ” 457 . Yesternight . We have lost this word , though we retain yesterday . Cf . yester-morn in v. 104 below . As far = as far back as . 460 . Was on , etc . The MS. reads : “ Is often on the future bent . ” If force of evidence could authorize us to believe facts inconsistent with the general laws of nature , enough might be produced in favor of the existence of the second-sight . It is called in Gaelic Taishitaraugh , from Taish , an unreal or shadowy appearance ; and those possessed of the faculty are called Taishatrin , which may be aptly translated visionaries . Martin , a steady believer in the second-sight , gives the following account of it :— ‘ The second-sight is a singular faculty of seeing an otherwise invisible object without any previous means used by the person that uses if for that end : the vision makes such a lively impression upon the seers , that they neither see nor think of any thing else , except the vision , as long as it continues ; and then they appear pensive or jovial , according to the object that was represented to them . ‘ At the sight of a vision , the eyelids of the person are erected , and the eyes continue staring until the object vanish . This is obvious to others who are by when the persons happen to see a vision , and occurred more than once to my own observation , and to others that were with me .... ‘ If a woman is seen standing at a man 's left hand , it is a presage that she will be his wife , whether they be married to others , or unmarried at the time of the apparition . ‘ To see a spark of fire fall upon one 's arm or breast is a forerunner of a dead child to be seen in the arms of those persons ; of which there are several fresh instances .... ‘ To see a seat empty at the time of one 's sitting in it , is a presage of that person 's death soon after ’ ( Martin 's Description of the Western Islands , 1716 , 8vo , p. 300 , et seq . ) . “ To these particulars innumerable examples might be added , all attested by grave and credible authors . But , in despite of evidence which neither Bacon , Boyle , nor Johnson were able to resist , the Taish , with all its visionary properties , seems to be now universally abandoned to the use of poetry . The exquisitely beautiful poem of Lochiel will at once occur to the recollection of every reader ” ( Scott ) . 462 . Birchen . Shaded by birches . Cf . Milton 's “ cedarn alleys ” in Comus , 990 . 464 . Lincoln green . A cloth made in Lincoln , much worn by hunters . 467 . Heron . The early eds . have “ heron 's . ” 475 . Errant-knight . Knight-errant . 476 . Sooth . True . We find soothest in Milton , Comus , 823 . The noun sooth ( truth ) is more common , and still survives in soothsayer ( teller of hidden truth ) . Cf . v. 64 below . 478 . Emprise . Enterprise . Cf . Spenser , F. Q. ii . 7 . 39 : “ But give me leave to follow my emprise , ” etc . 485 . His noble hand . The MS. has “ This gentle hand ; ” and in the next line , “ the oars he drew . ” 490 . Frequent . Often ; one of the many instances of the adjective used adverbially in the poem . 492 . The rocky isle . It is still known as Ellen 's Isle . “ It is rather high , and irregularly pyramidal . It is mostly composed of dark-gray rocks , mottled with pale and gray lichens , peeping out here and there amid trees that mantle them ,— chiefly light , graceful birches , intermingled with red-berried mountain ashes and a few dark-green , spiry pines . The landing is beneath an aged oak ; and , as did the Lady and the Knight , the traveller now ascends ‘ a clambering unsuspected road , ’ by rude steps , to the small irregular summit of the island . A more poetic , romantic retreat could hardly be imagined : it is unique . It is completely hidden , not only by the trees , but also by an undergrowth of beautiful and abundant ferns and the loveliest of heather ” ( Hunnewell 's Lands of Scott ) . 500 . Winded . Wound ; used for the sake of the measure , as in v. 22 below . We find the participle winded in Much Ado , i . 1 . 243 ; but it is = blown . The verb in that sense is derived from the noun wind ( air in motion ) , and has no connection with wind , to turn . Cf . Wb . 504 . Here for retreat , etc . Scott has the following note here : “ The Celtic chieftains , whose lives were continually exposed to peril , had usually , in the most retired spot of their domains , some place of retreat for the hour of necessity , which , as circumstances would admit , was a tower , a cavern , or a rustic hut , in a strong and secluded situation . One of these last gave refuge to the unfortunate Charles Edward , in his perilous wanderings after the battle of Culloden . “ It was situated in the face of a very rough , high , and rocky mountain , called Letternilichk , still a part of Benalder , full of great stones and crevices , and some scattered wood interspersed . The habitation called the Cage , in the face of that mountain , was within a small thick bush of wood . There were first some rows of trees laid down , in order to level the floor for a habitation ; and as the place was steep , this raised the lower side to an equal height with the other : and these trees , in the way of joists or planks , were levelled with earth and gravel . There were betwixt the trees , growing naturally on their own roots , some stakes fixed in the earth , which , with the trees , were interwoven with ropes , made of heath and birch twigs , up to the top of the Cage , it being of a round or rather oval shape ; and the whole thatched and covered over with fog . The whole fabric hung , as it were , by a large tree , which reclined from the one end , all along the roof , to the other , and which gave it the name of the Cage ; and by chance there happened to be two stones at a small distance from one another , in the side next the precipice , resembling the pillars of a chimney , where the fire was placed . The smoke had its vent out here , all along the fall of the rock , which was so much of the same color , that one could discover no difference in the clearest day ’ ( Home 's History of the Rebellion , Lond . 1802 , 4to , p. 381 ) . ” 525 . Idoean vine . Some have taken this to refer to the “ red whortleberry , ” the botanical name of which is Vaccinium vitis Idoea ; but as that is not a climber , it is more probably that the common vine is here meant . Idoean is from Ida , a mountain near ancient Troy ( there was another in Crete ) , famous for its vines . 526 . Clematis . The Climatis vitalba , one of the popular English names of which is virgin-bower . 528 . And every favored plant could bear . That is , which could endure . This ellipsis of the relative was very common in Elizabethan English . Cf . Shakespeare , M. for M. ii . 2 . 23 : “ I have a brother is condemned to die ; ” Rich . II . ii . 2 . 128 : “ The hate of those love not the king , ” etc . See also John , iii . 11 , etc . 532 . On heaven and on thy lady call . This is said gayly , or sportively , as keeping up the idea of a knight-errant . Cf . 475 above . 542 . Careless . See on 490 above . 546 . Target . Buckler ; the targe of iii . 445 , etc . See Scott 's note on v. 380 below . 548 . Store . Stored , laid up ; an obsolete adjective . Cf . iii . 3 below , and see also on vi . 124 . 551 . And there the wild-cat 's , etc . The MS. reads : “ There hung the wild-cat 's brindled hide , Above the elk 's branched brow and skull , And frontlet of the forest bull . ” 559 . Garnish forth . Cf . furnish forth in 442 above . 566 . Brook . Bear , endure ; now seldom used except with reference to what is endured against one 's will or inclination . It seems to be a favorite word with Scott . 573 . Ferragus or Ascabart . “ These two sons of Anak flourished in romantic fable . The first is well known to the admirers of Ariosto by the name of Ferrau . He was an antagonist of Orlando , and was at length slain by him in single combat .... Ascapart , or Ascabart , makes a very material figure in the History of Bevis of Hampton , by whom he was conquered . His effigies may be seen guarding one side of the gate at Southampton , while the other is occupied by Bevis himself ” ( Scott ) . 580 . To whom , though more than kindred knew . The MS. reads : “ To whom , though more remote her claim , Young Ellen gave a mother 's name . ” She was the maternal aunt of Ellen , but was loved as a mother by her , or more than ( such ) kindred ( usually ) knew ( in way of affection ) . 585 . Though all unasked , etc . “ The Highlanders , who carried hospitality to a punctilious excess , are said to have considered it as churlish to ask a stranger his name or lineage before he had taken refreshment . Feuds were so frequent among them , that a contrary rule would in many cases have produced the discovery of some circumstance which might have excluded the guest from the benefit of the assistance he stood in need of ” ( Scott ) . 591 . Snowdoun . An old name of Stirling Castle . See vi . 789 below . 592 . Lord of a barren heritage . “ By the misfortunes of the earlier Jameses , and the internal feuds of the Scottish chiefs , the kingly power had become little more than a name . Each chief was a petty king in his own district , and gave just so much obedience to the king 's authority as suited his convenience ” ( Taylor ) . 596 . Wot . Knows ; the present of the obsolete wit ( the infinitive to wit is still use in legal forms ) , not of weet , as generally stated . See Matzner , Eng . Gram . i . 382 . Cf . Shakespeare , Rich . III . ii . 3 . 18 : “ No , no , good friends , God wot . ” He also uses wots ( as in Hen . V. iv . 1 . 299 ) and a participle wotting ( in W. T. iii . 2 . 77 ) . 602 . Require . Request , ask ; as in Elizanethan English . Cf . Shakespeare , Hen . VIII . ii . 4 . 144 : “ In humblest manner I require your highness , ” etc . 603 . The elder lady 's mien . The MS. has “ the mother 's easy mien . ” 606 . Ellen , though more , etc . The MS. reads : “ Ellen , though more her looks betrayed The simple heart of mountain maid , In speech and gesture , form and grace , Showed she was come of gentle race ; ‘ T was strange , in birth so rude , to find Such face , such manners , and such mind . Each anxious hint the stranger gave , The mother heard with silence grave . ” 616 . Weird women we , etc . See on 35 above . Weird here = skilled in witchcraft ; like the “ weird sisters ” of Macbeth . Down = hill ( the Gaelic dun ) . 622 . A harp unseen . Scott has the following note here : “ ‘ " They [ the Highlanders ] delight much in musicke , but chiefly in harps and clairschoes of their own fashion . The strings of the clairschoes are made of brasse wire , and the strings of the harps of sinews ; which strings they strike either with their nayles , growing long , or else with an instrument appointed for that use . They take great pleasure to decke their harps and clairschoes with silver and precious stones ; the poore ones that cannot attayne hereunto , decke them with christall . They sing verses prettily compound , contayning ( for the most part ) prayses of valiant men . There is not almost any other argument , whereof their rhymes intreat . They speak the ancient French language , altered a little . ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>“ The harp and chairschoes are now only heard of in the Highlands in ancient song . At what period these instruments ceased to be used , is not on record ; and tradition is silent on this head . But , as Irish harpers occasionally visited the Highlands and Western Isles till lately , the harp might have been extant so late as the middle of the present century . Thus far we know , that from remote times down to the present , harpers were received as welcome guests , particularly in the Highlands of Scotland ; and so late as the latter end of the sixteenth century , as appears by the above quotations , the harp was in common use among the natives of the Western Isles . How it happened that the noisy and inharmonious bagpipe banished the soft and expressive harp , we cannot say ; but certain it is , that the bagpipe is now the only instrument that obtains universally in the Highland districts ’ ( Campbell 's Journey through North Britain . London , 1808 , 4to , i . 175 ) . “ Mr. Gunn , of Edinburgh , has lately published a curious Essay upon the Harp and Harp Music of the Highlands of Scotland . That the instrument was once in common use there , is most certain . Cleland numbers an acquaintance with it among the few accomplishments which his satire allows to the Highlanders :— ‘ In nothing they 're accounted sharp , Except in bagpipe or in harm . ’ ” 624 . Soldier , rest ! etc . The metre of this song is trochaic ; that is , the accents fall regularly on the odd syllables . 631 . In slumber dewing . That is , bedewing . For the metaphor , cf . Shakespeare , Rich . III . iv . 1 . 84 : “ the golden dew of sleep ; ” and J. C. ii . 1 . 230 : “ the honey-heavy dew of slumber . ” 635 . Morn of toil , etc . The MS. has “ noon of hunger , night of waking ; ” and in the next line , “ rouse ” for reach . 638 . Pibroch . “ A Highland air , suited to the particular passion which the musician would either excite or assuage ; generally applied to those airs that are played on the bagpipe before the Highlanders when they go out to battle ” ( Jamieson ) . Here it is put for the bagpipe itself . See also on ii . 363 below . 642 . And the bittern sound his drum . Goldsmith ( D. V. 44 ) calls the bird “ the hollow-sounding bittern ; ” and in his Animated Nature , he says that of all the notes of waterfowl “ there is none so dismally hollow as the booming of the bittern . ” 648 . She paused , etc . The MS. has “ She paused — but waked again the lay . ” 655 . The MS. reads : “ Slumber sweet our spells shall deal ye ; ” and in 657 : “ Let our slumbrous spells | avail ye | beguile ye . ” 657 . Reveille . The call to rouse troops or huntsmen in the morning . 669 . Forest sports . The MS. has “ mountain chase . ” 672 . Not Ellens ’ spell . That is , not even Ellen 's spell . On the passage , cf . Rokeby , i . 2 : “ Sleep came at length , but with a train Of feelings true and fancies vain , Mingling , in wild disorder cast , The expected future with the past . ” 693 . Or is it all a vision now ? Lockhart quotes here Thomson 's Castle of Indolence : “ Ye guardian spirits , to whom man is dear , From these foul demons shield the midnight gloom : Angels of fancy and love , be near . And o'er the blank of sleep diffuse a bloom : Evoke the sacred shades of Greece and Rome , And let them virtue with a look impart ; But chief , awhile , O ! lend us from the tomb Those long-lost friends for whom in love we smart , and fill with pious awe and joy-mixt woe the heart . “ Or are you sportive ?— bid the morn of youth Rise to new light , and beam afresh the days Of innocence , simplicity , and truth ; To cares estranged , and manhood 's thorny ways . What transport , to retrace our boyish plays , Our easy bliss , when each thing joy supplied ; The woods , the mountains , and the warbling maze Of the wild books ! ” The Critical Review says of the following stanza ( xxxiv ): “ Such a strange and romantic dream as may be naturally expected to flow from the extraordinary events of the day . It might , perhaps , be quoted as one of Mr. Scott 's most successful efforts in descriptive poetry . Some few lines of it are indeed unrivalled for delicacy and melancholy tenderness . ” 704 . Grisly . Grim , horrible ; an obsolete word , much used in old poetry . Cf . Spenser , F. Q. i . 5 . 30 : “ her darke griesly looke ; ” Shakespeare , 1 Hen . VI . i . 4 . 47 : “ My grisly countenance made others fly , ” etc . See also iv . 322 , etc . below . 723 . Played , etc . The MS. reads : “ Played on / the bosoms of the lake , / Lock Katrine 's still expanse ; The birch , the wild rose , and the broom Wasted around their rich perfume ... The birch-trees wept in balmy dew ; The aspen slept on Benvenue ; Wild were the heart whose passions ’ power Defied the influence of the hour . ” 724 . Passion 's . The reading of the 1st ed . and that of 1821 ; some recent eds . have “ passions ’ . ” 738 . Orisons . The 1st ed . has “ orison ” both here and in 740 ( the ed . of 1821 only in the latter ) ; but the word is almost invariably plural , both in poetry and prose — always in Shakespeare and Milton . Canto Second . 7 . A minstrel gray . “ That Highland chieftains , to a late period , retained in their service the bard , as a family officer , admits of very easy proof . The author of the Letters from the North of Scotland , an officer of engineers , quartered at Inverness about 1720 , who certainly cannot be deemed a favorable witness , gives the following account of the office , and of a bard , whom he heard exercise his talent of recitation :— ‘ The bard is killed in the genealogy of all the Highland families , sometimes preceptor to the young laird , celebrates in Irish verse the original of the tribe , the famous warlike actions of the successive heads , and sings his own lyricks as an opiate to the chief , when indisposed for sleep ; but poets are not equally esteemed and honored in all countries . I happened to be a witness of the dishonour done to the muse , at the house of one of the chiefs , where two of these bards were set at a good distance , at the lower end of a long table , with a parcel of Highlanders of no extraordinary appearance , over a cup of ale . Poor inspiration ! They were not asked to drink a glass of wine at our table , though the whole company consisted only of the great man , one of his near relations , and myself . After some little time , the chief ordered one of them to sing me a Highland song . The bard readily obeyed , and with a hoarse voice , and in a tune of few various notes , began , as I was told , one of his own lyricks ; and when he had proceeded to the fourth of fifth stanza , I perceived , by the names of several persons , glens , and mountains , which I had known or heard of before , that it was an account of some clan battle . But in his going on , the chief ( who piques himself upon his school-learning ) at some particular passage , bid him cease , and cryed out , “ There 's nothing like that in Virgil or Homer . ” I bowed , and told him I believed so . This you may believe was very edifying and delightful ’ ” ( Scott ) . 15 . Than men , etc . “ It is evident that the old bard , with his second-sight , has a glimmering notion who the stranger is . He speaks below { 311 } of ‘ courtly spy , ’ and James 's speech had betrayed a knowledge of the Douglas ” ( Taylor ) . 20 . Battled . The reading of the 1st ed . and that of 1821 ; “ battle ” in most others . Cf . i . 626 above . 22 . Where beauty , etc . The MS. has “ At tourneys where the brave resort . ” The reference is to the tournaments , “ Where , ” as Milton says ( L'Allegro , 119 ) , “ throngs of knights and barons bold . In weeds of peace , high triumphs hold , With store of ladies , whose bright eyes Rain influence , and judge the prize Of wit or arms , while both contend To win her grace whom all commend . ” Cf . 87 below . 26 . Love 's . The reading of the 1st ed . and that of 1821 ; most eds . have “ love . ” 29 . Plaided . The plaid was properly the dress of a Highlander , though it was worn also in the Lowlands . 51 . The Harper on the islet beach . “ This picture is touched with the hand of the true poet ” ( Jeffrey ) . 56 . As from . As if from . Cf . 64 and 83 below . This ellipsis was common in Elizabethan English . Cf . Shakespeare , Macb . ii . 2 . 28 : “ One cried ‘ God bless us ! ’ and ‘ Amen ’ the other , As they had seen me with these hangman 's hands . ” 65 . In the last sound . For the measure , see on i . 73 above . 69 . His fleet . That is , of ducks . Cf . i . 239 above . 80 . Would scorn . Who would scorn . See on i . 528 above . 84 . Turned him . See on i . 142 above , and cf . 106 below . 86 . After . Afterwards ; as in Shakespeare , Temp . ii . 2 . 10 : “ And after bite me , ” etc . The word is not now used adverbially of time , though we may say “ he followed after , ” etc . The 1st ed . reads “ that knight . ” 94 . Parts . Departs ; as often in poetry and earlier English . Cf . Goldsmith , D. V. 171 : “ Beside the bed where parting life was laid ; ” Gray , Elegy , 1 : “ the knell of parting day , ” etc . On the other hand , depart was used in the sense of part . In the Marriage Service “ till death us do part ” is a corruption of “ till death us depart . ” Wiclif 's Bible , in Matt . xix . 6 , has “ therfor a man departe not that thing that God hath ioyned . ” 103 . Another step , etc . The MS. has “ The loveliest Lowland fair to spy ; ” and the 1st ed . reads “ The step of parting fair to spy . ” 109 . The Graeme . Scott has the following note here : “ The ancient and powerful family of Graham ( which , for metrical reasons , is here smelled after the Scottish pronunciation ) held extensive possessions in the counties of Dumbarton and Stirling . Few families can boast of more historical renown , having claim to three of the most remarkable characters in the Scottish annals . Sir John the Graeme , the faithful and undaunted partaker of the labors and patriotic warfare of Wallace , fell in the unfortunate field of Falkirk , in 1298 . The celebrated Marquis of Montrose , in whom De Retz saw realized his abstract idea of the heroes of antiquity , was the second of these worthies . And , not withstanding the severity of his temper , and the rigor with which he executed the oppressive mandates of the princes whom he served , I do not hesitate to name as the third , John Graeme , of Claverhouse , Viscount of Dundee , whose heroic death , in the arms of victory , may be allowed to cancel the memory of his cruelty to the non-conformists , during the reigns of Charles II . and James II . ” 112 . Bower . The word meant a chamber ( see on i . 217 above ) , and was often used of the ladies ’ apartments in a house . In hall and bower = among men and women . The words are often thus associated . Cf . Spenser , Astrophel , 28 : “ Merily masking both in bowre and hall , ” etc . 115 . Arose . The 1st ed . misprints “ Across ; ” not noted in the Errata . 126 . And the proud march . See on i . 73 above . 131 . Saint Modan . A Scotch abbot of the 7th century . Scott says here : “ I am not prepared to show that Saint Modan was a performer on the harp . It was , however , no unsaintly accomplishment ; for Saint Dunstan certainly did play upon that instrument , which retaining , as was natural , a portion of the sanctity attached to its master 's character , announced future events by its spontaneous sound . ‘ But labouring once in these mechanic arts for a devout matrone that had sett him on work , his violl , that hung by him on the wall , of its own accord , without anie man 's helpe , distinctly sounded this anthime : Gaudent in coelis animae sanctorum qui Christi vestigia sunt secuti ; et quia pro eius amore sanguinem suum fuderunt , ideo cum Christo gaudent aeternum . Whereat all the companie being much astonished , turned their eyes from beholding him working , to looke on that strange accident .... Not long after , manie of the court that hitherunto had born a kind of fayned friendship towards him , began now greatly to envie at his progresse and rising in goodness , using manie crooked , backbiting meanes to diffame his vertues with the black markes of hypocrisie . And the better to authorise their calumnie , they brought in this that happened in the violl , affirming it to have been done by art magick . What more ? this wicked rumour encreased , dayly , till the king and others of the nobilitie taking hould thereof , Dunstan grew odious in their sight . Therefore he resolued to leaue the court , and goe to Elphegus , surnamed the Bauld , then bishop of Winchester , who was his cozen . Which his enemies understanding , they layd wayte for him in the way , and hauing throwne him off his horse , beate him , and dragged him in the durt in the most miserable manner , meaning to have slaine him , had not a companie of mastiue dogges , that came unlookt uppon them , defended and redeemed him from their crueltie . When with sorrow he was ashamed to see dogges more humane than they . And giuing thankes to Almightie God , he sensibly againe perceaued that the tunes of his violl had giuen him a warning of future accidents ’ ( Flower of the Lives of the most renowned Sainets of England , Scotland , and Ireland , by the R. Father Hierome Porter . Doway , 1632 4to . tome i. p. 438 ) . “ The same supernatural circumstance is alluded to by the anonymous author of Grim , the Collier of Croydon : ‘ —— -  [ Dunstant 's harp sounds on the wall . ] ‘ Forrest . Hark , hark , my lord , the holy abbot 's harp Sounds by itself so hanging on the wall ! ‘ Dunstan . Unhallow 'd man , that scorn'st the sacred rede , Hark , how the testimony of my truth Sounds heavenly music with an angel 's hand , To testify Dunstan 's integrity , And prove thy active boast of no effect . ’ ” 141 . Bothwell 's bannered hall . The picturesque ruins of Bothwell Castle stand on the banks of the Clyde , about nine miles above Glasgow . Some parts of the walls are 14 feet thick , and 60 feet in height . They are covered with ivy , wild roses , and wall-flowers . “ The tufted grass lines Bothwell 's ancient hall , The fox peeps cautious from the creviced wall , Where once proud Murray , Clydesdale 's ancient lord , A mimic sovereign , held the festal board . ” 142 . Ere Douglases , to ruin driven . Scott says : “ The downfall of the Douglases of the house of Angus , during the reign of James V ., is the event alluded to in the text . The Earl of Angus , it will be remembered , had married the queen dowager , and availed himself of the right which he thus acquired , as well as of his extensive power , to retain the king in a sort of tutelage , which approached very near to captivity . Several open attempts were made to rescue James from this thraldom , with which he was well known to be deeply disgusted ; but the valor of the Douglases , and their allies , gave them the victory in every conflict . At length , the king , while residing at Falkland , contrived to escape by night out of his own court and palace , and rode full speed to Stirling Castle , where the governor , who was of the opposite faction , joyfully received him . Being thus at liberty , James speedily summoned around him such peers as he knew to be most inimical to the domination of Angus , and laid his complaint before them , says Pitscottie , ‘ with great lamentations : showing to them how he was holding in subjection , thir years bygone , by the Earl of Angus , and his kin and friends , who oppressed the whole country , and spoiled it , under the pretence of justice and his authority ; and had slain many of his lieges , kinsmen , and friends , because they would have had it mended at their hands , and put him at liberty , as he ought to have been , at the counsel of his whole lords , and not have been subjected and corrected with no particular men , by the rest of his nobles : Therefore , said he , I desire , my lords , that I may be satisfied of the said earl , his kin , and friends ; for I avow , that Scotland shall not hold us both , while [ i. e . till ] I be revenged on him and his . ‘ The lords hearing the king 's complaint and lamentation , and also the great rage , fury , and malice , that he bure toward the Earl of Angus , his kin and friends , they concluded all and thought it best , that he should be summoned to underly the law ; if he fand not caution , nor yet compear himself , that he should be put to the horn , with all his kin and friends , so many as were contained in the letters . And further , the lords ordained , by advice of his majesty , that his brother and friends should be summoned to find caution to underly the law within a certain day , or else be put to the horn . But the earl appeared not , nor none for him ; and so he was put to the horn , with all his kin and friends : so many as were contained in the summons , that compeared not , were banished , and holden traitors to the king . ’ ” 159 . From Tweed to Spey . From the Tweed , the southern boundary of Scotland , to the Spey , a river far to the north in Invernessshire ; that is , from one end of the land to the other . 170 . Reave . Tear away . The participle reft is still used , at least in poetry . Cf . Shakespeare , V. and A . 766 : “ Or butcher-sire that reaves his son of life ” ( that is , bereaves ) ; Spenser , F. Q. i . 3 . 36 : “ He to him lept , in minde to reave his life ; ” Id . ii . 8 . 15 : “ I will him reave of arms , ” etc . 178 . It drinks , etc . The MS. has “ No blither dewdrop cheers the rose . ” 195 , 196 . To see ... dance . This couplet is not in the MS. 200 . The Lady of the Bleeding Heart . The bleeding heart was the cognizance of the Douglas family . Robert Bruce , on his death-bed , bequeathed his heart to his friend , the good Lord James , to be borne in war against the Saracens . “ He joined Alphonso , King of Leon and Castile , then at war with the Moorish chief Osurga , of Granada , and in a keen contest with the Moslems he flung before him the casket containing the precious relic , crying out , ‘ Onward as thou wert wont , thou noble heart , Douglas will follow thee . ’ Douglas was slain , but his body was recovered , and also the precious casket , and in the end Douglas was laid with his ancestors , and the heart of Bruce deposited in the church of Melrose Abbey ” ( Burton 's Hist . of Scotland ) . 201 . Fair . The 1st ed . ( and probably the MS ., though not noted by Lockhart ) has “ Gay . ” 203 . Yet is this , etc . The MS. and 1st ed . read : “ This mossy rock , my friend , to me Is worth gay chair and canopy . ” 205 . Footstep . The reading of the 1st and other early eds . ; “ footsteps ” in recent ones . 206 . Strathspey . A Highland dance , which takes its name from the strath , or broad valley , of the Spey ( 159 above ) . 213 . Clan-Alpine 's pride . “ The Siol Alpine , or race of Alpine , includes several clans who claimed descent from Kenneth McAlpine , an ancient king . These are the Macgregors , the Grants , the Mackies , the Mackinnans , the MacNabs , the MacQuarries , and the Macaulays . Their common emblem was the pine , which is now confined to the Macgregors ” ( Taylor ) . 214 . Loch Lomond . This beautiful lake , “ the pride of Scottish lakes , ” is about 23 miles in length and 5 miles in its greatest breadth . At the southern end are many islands , one of which , Inch-Cailliach ( the Island of Women , so called from a nunnery that was once upon it ) , was the burial-place of Clan-Alpine . See iii . 191 below . 216 . A Lennox foray . That is , a raid in the lands of the Lennox family , bordering on the southern end of Loch Lomond . On the island of Inch-Murrin , the ruins of Lennox Castle , formerly a residence of the Earls of Lennox , are still to be seen . There was another of their strongholds on the shore of the lake near Balloch , where the modern Balloch Castle now stands .</p>
