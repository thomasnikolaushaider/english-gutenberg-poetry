   <head>HART-LEAP WELL</head>
   <p>Hart-Leap Well is a small spring of water , about five miles from Richmond in Yorkshire , and near the side of the road which leads from Richmond to Askrigg . Its name is derived from a remarkable chase , the memory of which is preserved by the monuments spoken of in the second Part of the following Poem , which monuments do now exist as I have there described them .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The Knight had ridden down from Wensley moor</l>
     <l n="2">With the slow motion of a summer 's cloud ;</l>
     <l n="3">He turn 'd aside towards a Vassal 's door ,</l>
     <l n="4">And , “ Bring another Horse ! ” he cried aloud .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">“ Another Horse ! ” — That shout the Vassal heard ,</l>
     <l n="6">And saddled his best steed , a comely Grey ;</l>
     <l n="7">Sir Walter mounted him ; he was the third</l>
     <l n="8">Which he had mounted on that glorious day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Joy sparkeled in the prancing Courser 's eyes ;</l>
     <l n="10">The horse and horsemen are a happy pair ;</l>
     <l n="11">But , though Sir Walter like a falcon flies ,</l>
     <l n="12">There is a doleful silence in the air .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">A rout this morning left Sir Walter 's Hall ,</l>
     <l n="14">That as they gallop 'd made the echoes roar ;</l>
     <l n="15">But horse and man are vanish 'd , one and all ;</l>
     <l n="16">Such race , I think , was never seen before .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Sir Walter , restless as a veering wind ,</l>
     <l n="18">Calls to the few tired dogs that yet remain :</l>
     <l n="19">Brach , Swift and Music , noblest of their kind ,</l>
     <l n="20">Follow , and weary up the mountain strain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">The Knight halloo 'd , he chid and cheer 'd them on</l>
     <l n="22">With suppliant gestures and upbraidings stern ;</l>
     <l n="23">But breath and eye-sight fail , and , one by one ,</l>
     <l n="24">The dogs are stretch 'd among the mountain fern .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">Where is the throng , the tumult of the chace ?</l>
     <l n="26">The bugles that so joyfully were blown ?</l>
     <l n="27">— This race it looks not like an earthly race ;</l>
     <l n="28">Sir Walter and the Hart are left alone .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">The poor Hart toils along the mountain side ;</l>
     <l n="30">I will not stop to tell how far he fled ,</l>
     <l n="31">Nor will I mention by what death he died ;</l>
     <l n="32">But now the Knight beholds him lying dead .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">Dismounting then , he lean 'd against a thorn ;</l>
     <l n="34">He had no follower , dog , nor man , nor boy :</l>
     <l n="35">He neither smack 'd his whip , nor blew his horn ,</l>
     <l n="36">But gaz 'd upon the spoil with silent joy .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">Close to the thorn on which Sir Walter lean 'd ,</l>
     <l n="38">Stood his dumb partner in this glorious act ;</l>
     <l n="39">Weak as a lamb the hour that it is yean 'd ,</l>
     <l n="40">And foaming like a mountain cataract .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="41">Upon his side the Hart was lying stretch 'd :</l>
     <l n="42">His nose half-touch 'd a spring beneath a hill ,</l>
     <l n="43">And with the last deep groan his breath had fetch 'd</l>
     <l n="44">The waters of the spring were trembling still .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="45">And now , too happy for repose or rest ,</l>
     <l n="46">Was never man in such a joyful case ,</l>
     <l n="47">Sir Walter walk 'd all round , north , south and west ,</l>
     <l n="48">And gaz 'd , and gaz 'd upon that darling place .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="49">And turning up the hill , it was at least</l>
     <l n="50">Nine roods of sheer ascent , Sir Walter found</l>
     <l n="51">Three several marks which with his hoofs the beast</l>
     <l n="52">Had left imprinted on the verdant ground .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="53">Sir Walter wiped his face , and cried , “ Till now</l>
     <l n="54">Such sight was never seen by living eyes :</l>
     <l n="55">Three leaps have borne him from this lofty brow ,</l>
     <l n="56">Down to the very fountain where he lies . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="57">I 'll build a Pleasure-house upon this spot ,</l>
     <l n="58">And a small Arbour , made for rural joy ;</l>
     <l n="59">Twill be the traveller 's shed , the pilgrim 's cot ,</l>
     <l n="60">A place of love for damsels that are coy .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="61">A cunning Artist will I have to frame</l>
     <l n="62">A bason for that fountain in the dell ;</l>
     <l n="63">And they , who do make mention of the same ,</l>
     <l n="64">From this day forth , shall call it Hart-leap Well .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="65">And , gallant brute ! to make thy praises known ,</l>
     <l n="66">Another monument shall here be rais 'd ;</l>
     <l n="67">Three several pillars , each a rough hewn stone ,</l>
     <l n="68">And planted where thy hoofs the turf have graz 'd .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="69">And in the summer-time when days are long ,</l>
     <l n="70">I will come hither with my paramour ,</l>
     <l n="71">And with the dancers , and the minstrel 's song ,</l>
     <l n="72">We will make merry in that pleasant bower .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="73">Till the foundations of the mountains fail</l>
     <l n="74">My mansion with its arbour shall endure ,</l>
     <l n="75">— The joy of them who till the fields of Swale ,</l>
     <l n="76">And them who dwell among the woods of Ure .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="77">Then home he went , and left the Hart , stone-dead ,</l>
     <l n="78">With breathless nostrils stretch 'd above the spring .</l>
     <l n="79">And soon the Knight perform 'd what he had said ,</l>
     <l n="80">The fame whereof through many a land did ring .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="81">Ere thrice the moon into her port had steer 'd ,</l>
     <l n="82">A cup of stone receiv 'd the living well ;</l>
     <l n="83">Three pillars of rude stone Sir Walter rear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="84">And built a house of pleasure in the dell .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="85">And near the fountain , flowers of stature tall</l>
     <l n="86">With trailing plants and trees were intertwin 'd ,</l>
     <l n="87">Which soon composed a little sylvan hall ,</l>
     <l n="88">A leafy shelter from the sun and wind .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="89">And thither , when the summer days were long ,</l>
     <l n="90">Sir Walter journey 'd with his paramour ;</l>
     <l n="91">And with the dancers and the minstrel 's song</l>
     <l n="92">Made merriment within that pleasant bower .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="93">The Knight , Sir Walter , died in course of time ,</l>
     <l n="94">And his bones lie in his paternal vale .—</l>
     <l n="95">But there is matter for a second rhyme ,</l>
     <l n="96">And I to this would add another tale .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>PART SECOND .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The moving accident is not my trade .</l>
     <l n="2">To curl the blood I have no ready arts ;</l>
     <l n="3">‘ Tis my delight , alone in summer shade ,</l>
     <l n="4">To pipe a simple song to thinking hearts ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">As I from Hawes to Richmond did repair ,</l>
     <l n="6">It chanc 'd that I saw standing in a dell</l>
     <l n="7">Three aspins at three corners of a square ,</l>
     <l n="8">And one , not four yards distant , near a well .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">What this imported I could ill divine ,</l>
     <l n="10">And , pulling now the rein my horse to stop ,</l>
     <l n="11">I saw three pillars standing in a line ,</l>
     <l n="12">The last stone pillar on a dark hill-top .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">The trees were grey , with neither arms nor head ;</l>
     <l n="14">Half-wasted the square mound of tawny green ;</l>
     <l n="15">So that you just might say , as then I said ,</l>
     <l n="16">“ Here in old time the hand of man has been . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">I look 'd upon the hills both far and near ;</l>
     <l n="18">More doleful place did never eye survey ;</l>
     <l n="19">It seem 'd as if the spring-time came not here ,</l>
     <l n="20">And Nature here were willing to decay .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">I stood in various thoughts and fancies lost ,</l>
     <l n="22">When one who was in Shepherd 's garb attir 'd ,</l>
     <l n="23">Came up the hollow . Him did I accost ,</l>
     <l n="24">And what this place might be I then inquir 'd .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">The Shepherd stopp 'd , and that same story told</l>
     <l n="26">Which in my former rhyme I have rehears 'd .</l>
     <l n="27">“ A jolly place , ” said he , “ in times of old ,</l>
     <l n="28">But something ails it now ; the spot is curs 'd . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">You see these lifeless stumps of aspin wood ,</l>
     <l n="30">Some say that they are beeches , others elms ,</l>
     <l n="31">These were the Bower ; and here a Mansion stood ,</l>
     <l n="32">The finest palace of a hundred realms .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">The arbour does its own condition tell ,</l>
     <l n="34">You see the stones , the fountain , and the stream ,</l>
     <l n="35">But as to the great Lodge , you might as well</l>
     <l n="36">Hunt half a day for a forgotten dream .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">There 's neither dog nor heifer , horse nor sheep ,</l>
     <l n="38">Will wet his lips within that cup of stone ;</l>
     <l n="39">And , oftentimes , when all are fast asleep ,</l>
     <l n="40">This water doth send forth a dolorous groan .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="41">Some say that here a murder has been done ,</l>
     <l n="42">And blood cries out for blood : but , for my part ,</l>
     <l n="43">I 've guess 'd , when I 've been sitting in the sun ,</l>
     <l n="44">That it was all for that unhappy Hart .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="45">What thoughts must through the creature 's brain have pass 'd !</l>
     <l n="46">To this place from the stone upon the steep</l>
     <l n="47">Are but three bounds , and look , Sir , at this last !</l>
     <l n="48">O Master ! it has been a cruel leap .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="49">For thirteen hours he ran a desperate race ;</l>
     <l n="50">And in my simple mind we cannot tell</l>
     <l n="51">What cause the Hart might have to love this place ,</l>
     <l n="52">And come and make his death-bed near the well .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="53">Here on the grass perhaps asleep he sank ,</l>
     <l n="54">Lull 'd by this fountain in the summer-tide ;</l>
     <l n="55">This water was perhaps the first he drank</l>
     <l n="56">When he had wander 'd from his mother 's side .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="57">In April here beneath the scented thorn</l>
     <l n="58">He heard the birds their morning carols sing ,</l>
     <l n="59">And he , perhaps , for aught we know , was born</l>
     <l n="60">Not half a furlong from that self-same spring .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="61">But now here 's neither grass nor pleasant shade ;</l>
     <l n="62">The sun on drearier hollow never shone :</l>
     <l n="63">So will it be , as I have often said ,</l>
     <l n="64">Till trees , and stones , and fountain all are gone .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="65">Grey-headed Shepherd , thou hast spoken well ;</l>
     <l n="66">Small difference lies between thy creed and mine ;</l>
     <l n="67">This beast not unobserv 'd by Nature fell ,</l>
     <l n="68">His death was mourn 'd by sympathy divine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="69">The Being , that is in the clouds and air ,</l>
     <l n="70">That is in the green leaves among the groves .</l>
     <l n="71">Maintains a deep and reverential care</l>
     <l n="72">For them the quiet creatures whom he loves .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="73">The Pleasure-house is dust :— behind , before ,</l>
     <l n="74">This , is no common waste , no common gloom ;</l>
     <l n="75">But Nature , in due course of time , once more</l>
     <l n="76">Shall here put on her beauty and her bloom .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="77">She leaves these objects to a slow decay</l>
     <l n="78">That what we are , and have been , may be known ;</l>
     <l n="79">But , at the coming of the milder day ,</l>
     <l n="80">These monuments shall all be overgrown .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="81">One lesson , Shepherd , let us two divide ,</l>
     <l n="82">Taught both by what she shews , and what conceals ,</l>
     <l n="83">Never to blend our pleasure or our pride</l>
     <l n="84">With sorrow of the meanest thing that feels .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="85">There was a Boy , ye knew him well , ye Cliffs</l>
     <l n="86">And Islands of Winander ! many a time ,</l>
     <l n="87">At evening , when the stars had just begun</l>
     <l n="88">To move along the edges of the hills ,</l>
     <l n="89">Rising or setting , would he stand alone ,</l>

     <l n="91">And there , with fingers interwoven , both hands</l>
     <l n="92">Press 'd closely palm to palm and to his mouth</l>
     <l n="93">Uplifted , he , as through an instrument ,</l>
     <l n="94">Blew mimic hootings to the silent owls</l>
     <l n="95">That they might answer him . And they would shout</l>
     <l n="96">Across the wat'ry vale and shout again</l>
     <l n="97">Responsive to his call , with quivering peals ,</l>
     <l n="98">And long halloos , and screams , and echoes loud</l>
     <l n="99">Redoubled and redoubled , a wild scene</l>

     <l n="100">Of mirth and jocund din . And , when it chanced</l>
     <l n="101">That pauses of deep silence mock 'd his skill ,</l>
     <l n="102">Then , sometimes , in that silence , while he hung</l>
     <l n="103">Listening , a gentle shock of mild surprize</l>
     <l n="104">Has carried far into his heart the voice</l>
     <l n="105">Of mountain torrents , or the visible scene</l>
     <l n="106">Would enter unawares into his mind</l>
     <l n="107">With all its solemn imagery , its rocks ,</l>
     <l n="108">Its woods , and that uncertain heaven , receiv 'd</l>
     <l n="109">Into the bosom of the steady lake .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="110">Fair are the woods , and beauteous is the spot ,</l>

     <l n="112">Upon a slope above the village school ,</l>
     <l n="113">And there along that bank when I have pass 'd</l>
     <l n="114">At evening , I believe , that near his grave</l>
     <l n="115">A full half-hour together I have stood ,</l>

     <l n="1">These Tourists , Heaven preserve us ! needs must live</l>
     <l n="2">A profitable life : some glance along</l>
     <l n="3">Rapid and gay , as if the earth were air .</l>
     <l n="4">And they were butterflies to wheel about</l>
     <l n="5">Long as their summer lasted ; some , as wise ,</l>
     <l n="6">Upon the forehead of a jutting crag</l>
     <l n="7">Sit perch 'd with book and pencil on their knee ,</l>
     <l n="8">And look and scribble , scribble on and look ,</l>
     <l n="9">Until a man might travel twelve stout miles ,</l>
     <l n="10">Or reap an acre of his neighbour 's corn .</l>
     <l n="11">But , for that moping son of Idleness</l>
     <l n="12">Why can he tarry yonder ?— In our church-yard</l>
     <l n="13">Is neither epitaph nor monument ,</l>
     <l n="14">Tomb-stone nor name , only the turf we tread .</l>
     <l n="15">And a few natural graves . To Jane , his Wife ,</l>
     <l n="16">Thus spake the homely Priest of Ennerdale .</l>
     <l n="17">It was a July evening , and he sate</l>
     <l n="18">Upon the long stone seat beneath the eaves</l>
     <l n="19">Of his old cottage , as it chanced that day ,</l>
     <l n="20">Employ 'd in winter 's work . Upon the stone</l>
     <l n="21">His Wife sate near him , teasing matted wool ,</l>
     <l n="22">While , from the twin cards tooth 'd with glittering wire ,</l>
     <l n="23">He fed the spindle of his youngest child ,</l>
     <l n="24">Who turn 'd her large round wheel in the open air</l>
     <l n="25">With back and forward steps . Towards the field</l>
     <l n="26">In which the parish chapel stood alone ,</l>
     <l n="27">Girt round with a bare ring of mossy wall ,</l>
     <l n="28">While half an hour went by , the Priest had sent</l>
     <l n="29">Many a long look of wonder , and at last ,</l>
     <l n="30">Risen from his seat , beside the snowy ridge</l>
     <l n="31">Of carded wool — which the old Man had piled</l>
     <l n="32">He laid his implements with gentle care ,</l>
     <l n="33">Each in the other lock 'd ; and , down the path</l>
     <l n="34">Which from his cottage to the church-yard led ,</l>
     <l n="35">He took his way , impatient to accost</l>
     <l n="36">The Stranger , whom he saw still lingering there .</l>

     <l n="37">‘ Twas one well known to him in former days ,</l>
     <l n="38">A Shepherd-lad : who ere his thirteenth year</l>
     <l n="39">Had chang 'd his calling , with the mariners</l>
     <l n="40">A fellow-mariner , and so had fared</l>
     <l n="41">Through twenty seasons ; but he had been rear 'd</l>
     <l n="42">Among the mountains , and he in his heart</l>
     <l n="43">Was half a Shepherd on the stormy seas .</l>
     <l n="44">Oft in the piping shrouds had Leonard heard</l>
     <l n="45">The tones of waterfalls , and inland sounds</l>
     <l n="46">Of caves and trees ; and when the regular wind</l>
     <l n="47">Between the tropics fill 'd the steady sail</l>
     <l n="48">And blew with the same breath through days and weeks ,</l>
     <l n="49">Lengthening invisibly its weary line</l>
     <l n="50">Along the cloudless main , he , in those hours</l>
     <l n="51">Of tiresome indolence would often hang</l>
     <l n="52">Over the vessel 's aide , and gaze and gaze ,</l>
     <l n="53">And , while the broad green wave and sparkling foam</l>
     <l n="54">Flash 'd round him images and hues , that wrought</l>
     <l n="55">In union with the employment of his heart ,</l>
     <l n="56">He , thus by feverish passion overcome ,</l>
     <l n="57">Even with the organs of his bodily eye ,</l>
     <l n="58">Below him , in the bosom of the deep</l>
     <l n="59">Saw mountains , saw the forms of sheep that graz 'd</l>
     <l n="60">On verdant hills , with dwellings among trees ,</l>
     <l n="61">And Shepherds clad in the same country grey</l>
     <l n="62">Which he himself had worn .<span corresp="#note2" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span></l>

     <l n="23">Such a confusion in his memory ,</l>

     <l n="26">That it was not another grave , but one ,</l>
     <l n="27">He had forgotten . He had lost his path ,</l>
     <l n="28">As up the vale he came that afternoon ,</l>
     <l n="29">Through fields which once had been well known to him .</l>
     <l n="30">And Oh ! what joy the recollection now</l>
     <l n="31">Sent to his heart ! he lifted up his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="32">And looking round he thought that he perceiv 'd</l>
     <l n="33">Strange alteration wrought on every side</l>
     <l n="34">Among the woods and fields , and that the rocks ,</l>
     <l n="35">And the eternal hills , themselves were chang 'd .</l>

     <l n="39">He scann 'd him with a gay complacency .</l>
     <l n="40">Aye , thought the Vicar , smiling to himself ;</l>
     <l n="41">‘ Tis one of those who needs must leave the path</l>
     <l n="42">Of the world 's business , to go wild alone :</l>
     <l n="43">His arms have a perpetual holiday ,</l>
     <l n="44">The happy man will creep about the fields</l>
     <l n="45">Following his fancies by the hour , to bring</l>
     <l n="46">Tears down his check , or solitary smiles</l>
     <l n="47">Into his face , until the setting sun</l>
     <l n="48">Write Fool upon his forehead . Planted thus</l>
     <l n="49">Beneath a shed that overarch 'd the gate</l>
     <l n="50">Of this rude church-yard , till the stars appear 'd</l>
     <l n="51">The good man might have commun 'd with himself</l>

     <l n="53">Approach 'd ; he recogniz 'd the Priest at once ,</l>
     <l n="54">And after greetings interchang 'd , and given</l>
     <l n="55">By Leonard to the Vicar as to one</l>

     <l n="11">The OLD CUMBERLAND BEGGAR ,</l>
     <l n="12">A DESCRIPTION .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The class of Beggars to which the old man here described belongs , will probably soon be extinct . It consisted of poor , and , mostly , old and infirm persons , who confined themselves to a stated round in their neighbourhood , and had certain fixed days , on which , at different houses , they regularly received charity ; sometimes in money , but mostly in provisions .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I saw an aged Beggar in my walk ,</l>
     <l n="2">And he was seated by the highway side</l>
     <l n="3">On a low structure of rude masonry</l>
     <l n="4">Built at the foot of a huge hill , that they</l>
     <l n="5">Who lead their horses down the steep rough road</l>
     <l n="6">May thence remount at ease . The aged man</l>
     <l n="7">Had placed his staff across the broad smooth stone</l>
     <l n="8">That overlays the pile , and from a bag</l>
     <l n="9">All white with flour the dole of village dames ,</l>
     <l n="10">He drew his scraps and fragments , one by one ,</l>
     <l n="11">And scann 'd them with a fix 'd and serious look</l>
     <l n="12">Of idle computation . In the sun ,</l>
     <l n="13">Upon the second step of that small pile ,</l>
     <l n="14">Surrounded by those wild unpeopled hills ,</l>
     <l n="15">He sate , and eat his food in solitude ;</l>
     <l n="16">And ever , scatter 'd from his palsied hand ,</l>
     <l n="17">That still attempting to prevent the waste ,</l>
     <l n="18">Was baffled still , the crumbs in little showers</l>
     <l n="19">Fell on the ground , and the small mountain birds ,</l>
     <l n="20">Not venturing yet to peck their destin 'd meal ,</l>
     <l n="21">Approached within the length of half his staff .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="22">Him from my childhood have I known , and then</l>
     <l n="23">He was so old , he seems not older now ;</l>

     <l n="25">So helpless in appearance , that for him</l>
     <l n="26">The sauntering horseman-traveller does not throw</l>
     <l n="27">With careless hand his alms upon the ground ,</l>
     <l n="28">But stops , that he may safely lodge the coin</l>
     <l n="29">Within the old Man 's hat ; nor quits him so ,</l>
     <l n="30">But still when he has given his horse the rein</l>
     <l n="31">Towards the aged Beggar turns a look ,</l>
     <l n="32">Sidelong and half-reverted . She who tends</l>
     <l n="33">The toll-gate , when in summer at her door</l>
     <l n="34">She turns her wheel , if on the road she sees</l>
     <l n="35">The aged Beggar coming , quits her work ,</l>
     <l n="36">And lifts the latch for him that he may pass .</l>
     <l n="37">The Post-boy when his rattling wheels o'ertake</l>
     <l n="38">The aged Beggar , in the woody lane ,</l>
     <l n="39">Shouts to him from behind , and , if perchance</l>
     <l n="40">The old Man does not change his course , the Boy</l>
     <l n="41">Turns with less noisy wheels to the road-side ,</l>
     <l n="42">And passes gently by , without a curse</l>
     <l n="43">Upon his lips , or anger at his heart .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="44">He travels on , a solitary Man ,</l>
     <l n="45">His age has no companion . On the ground</l>
     <l n="46">His eyes are turn 'd , and , as he moves along ,</l>
     <l n="47">They move along the ground ; and evermore ;</l>
     <l n="48">Instead of common and habitual sight</l>
     <l n="49">Of fields with rural works , of hill and dale ,</l>
     <l n="50">And the blue sky , one little span of earth</l>
     <l n="51">Is all his prospect . Thus , from day to day ,</l>
     <l n="52">Bowbent , his eyes for ever on the ground ,</l>
     <l n="53">He plies his weary journey , seeing still ,</l>
     <l n="54">And never knowing that he sees , some straw ,</l>
     <l n="55">Some scatter 'd leaf , or marks which , in one track ,</l>
     <l n="56">The nails of cart or chariot wheel have left</l>

    <head>NOTE .</head>
    <p n="1">In Cumberland and Westmoreland are several Inscriptions upon the native rock which from the wasting of Time and the rudeness of the Workmanship had been mistaken for Runic . They are without doubt Roman .</p>
    <p n="2">The Roths , mentioned in this poem , is the River which flowing through the Lakes of Grasmere and Rydole fells into Wyndermere . On Helm-Crag , that impressive single Mountain at the head of the Vale of Grasmere , is a Rock which from most points of view bears a striking resemblance to an Old Woman cowering . Close by this rock is one of those Fissures or Caverns , which in the language of the Country are called Dungeons . The other Mountains either immediately surround the Vale of Grasmere , or belong to the same Cluster .</p>
    <p n="3">III .</p>
    <p n="4">There is an Eminence ,— of these our hills The last that parleys with the setting sun . We can behold it from our Orchard seat . And , when at evening we pursue our walk Along the public way , this Cliff , so high Above us , and so distant in its height , Is visible , and often seems to send Its own deep quiet to restore our hearts . The meteors make of it a favorite haunt : The star of Jove , so beautiful and large In the mid heav'ns , is never half so fair As when he shines above it . ‘ Tis in truth The loneliest place we have among the clouds .</p>
    <p n="5">And She who dwells with me , whom I have lov 'd With such communion , that no place on earth Can ever be a solitude to me , Hath said , this lonesome Peak shall bear my Name .</p>
    <p n="6">IV .</p>
    <p n="7">A narrow girdle of rough stones and crags , A rude and natural causeway , interpos 'd Between the water and a winding slope Of copse and thicket , leaves the eastern shore Of Grasmere safe in its own privacy . And there , myself and two beloved Friends , One calm September morning , ere the mist Had altogether yielded to the sun , Saunter 'd on this retir 'd and difficult way . — Ill suits the road with one in haste , but we Play 'd with our time ; and , as we stroll 'd along ,</p>
    <p n="8">It was our occupation to observe Such objects as the waves had toss 'd ashore , Feather , or leaf , or weed , or wither 'd bough , Each on the other heap 'd along the line Of the dry wreck . And in our vacant mood , Not seldom did we stop to watch some tuft Of dandelion seed or thistle 's beard , Which , seeming lifeless half , and half impell 'd By some internal feeling , skimm 'd along Close to the surface of the lake that lay Asleep in a dead calm , ran closely on Along the dead calm lake , now here , now there , In all its sportive wanderings all the while Making report of an invisible breeze That was its wings , its chariot , and its horse , Its very playmate , and its moving soul .</p>
    <p n="9">— And often , trifling with a privilege Alike indulg 'd to all , we paus 'd , one now , And now the other , to point out , perchance To pluck , some flower or water-weed , too fair Either to be divided from the place On which it grew , or to be left alone To its own beauty . Many such there are , Fair ferns and flowers , and chiefly that tall plant So stately , of the Queen Osmunda nam 'd , Plant lovelier in its own retir 'd abode On Grasmere 's beach , than Naid by the side Of Grecian brook , or Lady of the Mere Sole-sitting by the shores of old Romance . — So fared we that sweet morning : from the fields Meanwhile , a noise was heard , the busy mirth Of Reapers , Men and Women , Boys and Girls .</p>
    <p n="10">Delighted much to listen to those sounds , And in the fashion which I have describ 'd , Feeding unthinking fancies , we advanc 'd Along the indented shore ; when suddenly , Through a thin veil of glittering haze , we saw Before us on a point of jutting land The tall and upright figure of a Man Attir 'd in peasant 's garb , who stood alone Angling beside the margin of the lake . That way we turn 'd our steps : nor was it long , Ere making ready comments on the sight Which then we saw , with one and the same voice We all cried out , that he must be indeed An idle man , who thus could lose a day Of the mid harvest , when the labourer 's hire Is ample , and some little might be stor 'd Wherewith to chear him in the winter time .</p>
    <p n="11">Thus talking of that Peasant we approach 'd Close to the spot where with his rod and line He stood alone ; whereat he turn 'd his head To greet us — and we saw a man worn down By sickness , gaunt and lean , with sunken cheeks And wasted limbs , his legs so long and lean That for my single self I look 'd at them , Forgetful of the body they sustain 'd .— Too weak to labour in the harvest field , The man was using his best skill to gain A pittance from the dead unfeeling lake That knew not of his wants . I will not say What thoughts immediately were ours , nor how The happy idleness of that sweet morn , With all its lovely images , was chang 'd To serious musing and to self-reproach .</p>
    <p n="12">Nor did we fail to see within ourselves What need there is to be reserv 'd in speech , And temper all our thoughts with charity . — Therefore , unwilling to forget that day , My Friend , Myself , and She who then receiv 'd The same admonishment , have call 'd the plate By a memorial name , uncouth indeed As e'er by Mariner was giv'n to Bay Or Foreland on a new-discover 'd coast , And , POINT RASH-JUDGMENT is the Name it bears .</p>
    <p n="13">V .</p>
    <p n="14">To M. H .</p>
    <p n="15">Our walk was far among the ancient trees : There was no road , nor any wood-man 's path , But the thick umbrage , checking the wild growth Of weed sapling , on the soft green turf Beneath the branches of itself had made A track which brought us to a slip of lawn , And a small bed of water in the woods .</p>
    <p n="16">All round this pool both flocks and herds might drink On its firm margin , even as from a well Or some stone-bason which the Herdsman 's hand Had shap 'd for their refreshment , nor did sun Or wind from any quarter ever come But as a blessing to this calm recess , This glade of water and this one green field . The spot was made by Nature for herself : The travellers know it not , and ‘ twill remain Unknown to them ; but it is beautiful , And if a man should plant his cottage near . Should sleep beneath the shelter of its tress , And blend its waters with his daily meal , He would so love it that in his death-hour Its image would survive among his thoughts , And , therefore , my sweet MARY , this still nook With all its beeches we have named from You .</p>
    <p n="17">MICHAEL , A PASTORAL POEM .</p>
    <p n="18">MICHAEL ,</p>
    <p n="19">A PASTORAL POEM</p>
    <p n="20">If from the public way you turn your steps Up the tumultuous brook of Green-head Gill , You will suppose that with an upright path Your feet must struggle ; in such bold ascent The pastoral Mountains front you , face to face . But , courage ! for beside that boisterous Brook The mountains have all open 'd out themselves , And made a hidden valley of their own .</p>
    <p n="21">No habitation there is seen ; but such As journey thither find themselves alone With a few sheep , with rocks and stones , and kites That overhead are sailing in the sky . It is in truth an utter solitude , Nor should I have made mention of this Dell But for one object which you might pass by , Might see and notice not . Beside the brook There is a straggling heap of unhewn stones ! And to that place a story appertains , Which , though it be ungarnish 'd with events , Is not unfit , I deem , for the fire-side , Or for the summer shade . It was the first , The earliest of those tales that spake to me Of Shepherds , dwellers in the vallies , men Whom I already lov 'd , not verily For their own sakes , but for the fields and hills Where was their occupation and abode .</p>
    <p n="22">And hence this Tale , while I was yet a boy Careless of books , yet having felt the power Of Nature , by the gentle agency Of natural objects led me on to feel For passions that were not my own , and think At random and imperfectly indeed On man ; the heart of man and human life . Therefore , although it be a history Homely and rude , I will relate the same For the delight of a few natural hearts , And with yet fonder feeling , for the sake Of youthful Poets , who among these Hills Will be my second self when I am gone .</p>
    <p n="23">Upon the Forest-side in Grasmere Vale There dwelt a Shepherd , Michael was his name . An old man , stout of heart , and strong of limb . His bodily frame had been from youth to age Of an unusual strength : his mind was keen Intense and frugal , apt for all affairs , And in his Shepherd 's calling he was prompt And watchful more than ordinary men .</p>
    <p n="24">Hence he had learn 'd the meaning of all winds , Of blasts of every tone , and often-times When others heeded not , He heard the South Make subterraneous music , like the noise Of Bagpipers on distant Highland hills ; The Shepherd , at such warning , of his flock Bethought him , and he to himself would say The winds are now devising work for me !</p>
    <p n="25">And truly at all times the storm , that drives The Traveller to a shelter , summon 'd him Up to the mountains : he had been alone Amid the heart of many thousand mists That came to him and left him on the heights . So liv 'd he till his eightieth year was pass 'd .</p>
    <p n="26">And grossly that man errs , who should suppose That the green Valleys , and the Streams and Rocks Were things indifferent to the Shepherd 's thoughts . Fields , where with chearful spirits he had breath 'd The common air ; the hills , which he so oft Had climb 'd with vigorous steps ; which had impress 'd So many incidents upon his mind Of hardship , skill or courage , joy or fear ; Which like a book preserv 'd the memory Of the dumb animals , whom he had sav 'd , Had fed or shelter 'd , linking to such acts , So grateful in themselves , the certainty Of honorable gains ; these fields , these hills Which were his living Being , even more Than his own Blood — what could they less ? had laid Strong hold on his affections , were to him A pleasurable feeling of blind love , The pleasure which there is in life itself .</p>
    <p n="27">He had not passed his days in singleness . He had a Wife , a comely Matron , old Though younger than himself full twenty years . She was a woman of a stirring life Whose heart was in her house : two wheels she had Of antique form , this large for spinning wool , That small for flax , and if one wheel had rest , It was because the other was at work . The Pair had but one Inmate in their house , An only Child , who had been born to them When Michael telling o'er his years began To deem that he was old , in Shepherd 's phrase , With one foot in the grave . This only son , With two brave sheep dogs tried in many a storm .</p>
    <p n="28">The one of an inestimable worth , Made all their Household . I may truly say , That they were as a proverb in the vale For endless industry . When day was gone , And from their occupations out of doors The Son and Father were come home , even then , Their labour did not cease , unless when all Turn 'd to their cleanly supper-board , and there Each with a mess of pottage and skimm 'd milk , Sate round their basket pil 'd with oaten cakes , And their plain home-made cheese . Yet when their meal Was ended , LUKE ( for so the Son was nam 'd ) And his old Father , both betook themselves To such convenient work , as might employ Their hands by the fire-side ; perhaps to card Wool for the House-wife 's spindle , or repair Some injury done to sickle , flail , or scythe , Or other implement of house or field .</p>
    <p n="29">Down from the cicling by the chimney 's edge , Which in our ancient uncouth country style Did with a huge projection overbrow Large space beneath , as duly as the light Of day grew dim , the House-wife hung a lamp ; An aged utensil , which had perform 'd Service beyond all others of its kind .</p>
    <p n="30">Early at evening did it burn and late , Surviving Comrade of uncounted Hours Which going by from year to year had found And left the Couple neither gay perhaps Nor chearful , yet with objects and with hopes Living a life of eager industry .</p>
    <p n="31">And now , when LUKE was in his eighteenth year , There by the light of this old lamp they sate , Father and Son , while late into the night The House-wife plied her own peculiar work , Making the cottage thro ’ the silent hours Murmur as with the sound of summer flies .</p>
    <p n="32">Not with a waste of words , but for the sake Of pleasure , which I know that I shall give To many living now , I of this Lamp Speak thus minutely : for there are no few Whose memories will bear witness to my tale , The Light was famous in its neighbourhood , And was a public Symbol of the life , The thrifty Pair had liv 'd . For , as it chanc 'd , Their Cottage on a plot of rising ground Stood single , with large prospect North and South , High into Easedale , up to Dunmal-Raise , And Westward to the village near the Lake . And from this constant light so regular And so far seen , the House itself by all Who dwelt within the limits of the vale , Both old and young , was nam 'd The Evening Star .</p>
    <p n="33">Thus living on through such a length of years , The Shepherd , if he lov 'd himself , must needs Have lov 'd his Help-mate ; but to Michael 's heart This Son of his old age was yet more dear — Effect which might perhaps have been produc 'd By that instinctive tenderness , the same Blind Spirit , which is in the blood of all , Or that a child , more than all other gifts , Brings hope with it , and forward-looking thoughts , And stirrings of inquietude , when they By tendency of nature needs must fail .</p>
    <p n="34">From such , and other causes , to the thoughts Of the old Man his only Son was now The dearest object that he knew on earth . Exceeding was the love he bare to him , His Heart and his Heart 's joy ! For oftentimes Old Michael , while he was a babe in arms , Had done him female service , not alone For dalliance and delight , as is the use Of Fathers , but with patient mind enforc 'd To acts of tenderness ; and he had rock 'd His cradle with a woman 's gentle hand .</p>
    <p n="35">And in a later time , ere yet the Boy Had put on Boy 's attire , did Michael love , Albeit of a stern unbending mind , To have the young one in his sight , when he Had work by his own door , or when he sate With sheep before him on his Shepherd 's stool , Beneath that large old Oak , which near their door Stood , and from it 's enormous breadth of shade Chosen for the Shearer 's covert from the sun , Thence in our rustic dialect was call 'd The CLIPPING TREE ,<span corresp="#note10" type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>a name which yet it bears .</p>
    <note xml:id="note10" place="bottom" n="10">Clipping is the word used in the North of England for shearing .</note>
    <p n="36">There , while they two were sitting in the shade , With others round them , earnest all and blithe , Would Michael exercise his heart with looks Of fond correction and reproof bestow 'd Upon the child , if he dislurb 'd the sheep By catching at their legs , or with his shouts Scar 'd them , while they lay still beneath the shears .</p>
    <p n="37">And when by Heaven 's good grace the Boy grew up A healthy Lad , and carried in his cheek Two steady roses that were five years old , Then Michael from a winter coppice cut With his own hand a sapling , which he hoop 'd With iron , making it throughout in all Due requisites a perfect Shepherd 's Staff , And gave it to the Boy ; wherewith equipp 'd He as a Watchman oftentimes was plac 'd At gate or gap , to stem or turn the flock , And to his office prematurely call 'd There stood the urchin , as you will divine , Something between a hindrance and a help , And for this cause not always , I believe , Receiving from his Father hire of praise .</p>
    <p n="38">While this good household thus were living on From day to day , to Michael 's ear there came Distressful tidings . Long before , the time Of which I speak , the Shepherd had been bound In surety for his Brother 's Son , a man Of an industrious life , and ample means , But unforeseen misfortunes suddenly Had press 'd upon him , and old Michael now Was summon 'd to discharge the forfeiture , A grievous penalty , but little less Than half his substance . This un-look'dhYpppHeNfor claim At the first hearing , for a moment took More hope out of his life than he supposed That any old man ever could have lost .</p>
    <p n="39">As soon as he had gather 'd so much strength That he could look his trouble in the face , It seem 'd that his sole refuge was to sell A portion of his patrimonial fields . Such was his first resolve ; he thought again , And his heart fail 'd him . “ Isabel , ” said he , Two evenings after he had heard the news , “ I have been toiling more than seventy years , And in the open sun-shine of God 's love Have we all liv 'd , yet if these fields of ours Should pass into a Stranger 's hand , I think That I could not lie quiet in my grave . ”</p>
    <p n="40">“ Our lot is a hard lot ; the Sun itself Has scarcely been more diligent than I , And I have liv 'd to be a fool at last To my own family . An evil Man That was , and made an evil choice , if he Were false to us ; and if he were not false , There are ten thousand to whom loss like this Had been no sorrow . I forgive him — but ‘ Twere better to be dumb than to talk thus . When I began , my purpose was to speak Of remedies and of a chearful hope . ”</p>
    <p n="41">“ Our Luke shall leave us , Isabel ; the land Shall not go from us , and it shall be free , He shall possess it , free as is the wind That passes over it . We have , thou knowest , Another Kinsman , he will be our friend In this distress . He is a prosperous man , Thriving in trade , and Luke to him shall go , And with his Kinsman 's help and his own thrift , He quickly will repair this loss , and then May come again to us . If here he stay , What can be done ? Where every one is poor What can be gain 'd ? ” At this , the old man paus 'd , And Isabel sate silent , for her mind Was busy , looking back into past times .</p>
    <p n="42">There 's Richard Bateman , thought she to herself , He was a parish-boy — at the church-door They made a gathering for him , shillings , pence , And halfpennies , wherewith the Neighbours bought A Basket , which they fill 'd with Pedlar 's wares , And with this Basket on his arm , the Lad Went up to London , found a Master there , Who out of many chose the trusty Boy To go and overlook his merchandise Beyond the seas , where he grew wond'rous rich , And left estates and monies to the poor , And at his birth-place built a Chapel , floor 'd With Marble , which he sent from foreign lands . These thoughts , and many others of like sort , Pass 'd quickly thro ’ the mind of Isabel , And her face brighten 'd . The Old Man was glad .</p>
    <p n="43">And thus resum 'd . “ Well I Isabel , this scheme These two days has been meat and drink to me . Far more than we have lost is left us yet . — We have enough — I wish indeed that I Were younger , but this hope is a good hope . — Make ready Luke 's best garments , of the best Buy for him more , and let us send him forth To-morrow , or the next day , or to-night : — If he could go , the Boy should go to-night . ” Here Michael ceas 'd , and to the fields went forth With a light heart . The House-wife for five days Was restless morn and night , and all day long Wrought on with her best fingers to prepare Things needful for the journey of her Son .</p>
    <p n="44">But Isabel was glad when Sunday came To stop her in her work ; for , when she lay By Michael 's side , she for the two last nights Heard him , how he was troubled in his sleep : And when they rose at morning she could see That all his hopes were gone . That day at noon She said to Luke , while they two by themselves Were sitting at the door , “ Thou must not go , We have no other Child but thee to lose , None to remember — do not go away , For if thou leave thy Father he will die . ” The Lad made answer with a jocund voice , And Isabel , when she had told her fears , Recover 'd heart . That evening her best fare Did she bring forth , and all together sate Like happy people round a Christmas fire .</p>
    <p n="45">Next morning Isabel resum 'd her work , And all the ensuing week the house appear 'd As cheerful as a grove in Spring : at length The expected letter from their Kinsman came , With kind assurances that he would do His utmost for the welfare of the Boy , To which requests were added that forthwith He might be sent to him . Ten times or more The letter was read over ; Isabel Went forth to shew it to the neighbours round : Nor was there at that time on English Land A prouder heart than Luke 's . When Isabel Had to her house return 'd , the Old Man said , “ He shall depart to-morrow . ” To this word The House — wife answered , talking much of things Which , if at such , short notice he should go , Would surely be forgotten . But at length She gave consent , and Michael was at ease .</p>
    <p n="46">Near the tumultuous brook of Green-head Gill , In that deep Valley , Michael had design 'd To build a Sheep-fold , and , before he heard The tidings of his melancholy loss , For this same purpose he had gathered up A heap of stones , which close to the brook side Lay thrown together , ready for the work . With Luke that evening thitherward he walk 'd ; And soon as they had reach 'd the place he stopp 'd , And thus the Old Man spake to him . “ My Son , To-morrow thou wilt leave me ; with full heart I look upon thee , for thou art the same That wert a promise to me ere thy birth , And all thy life hast been my daily joy . I will relate to thee some little part Of our two histories ; ‘ twill do thee good When thou art from me , even if I should speak Of things thou caust not know of .— After thou First cam'st into the world , as it befalls To new-born infants , thou didst sleep away Two days , and blessings from thy Father 's tongue Then fell upon thee . Day by day pass 'd on , And still I lov 'd thee with encreasing love . ”</p>
    <p n="47">Never to living ear came sweeter sounds Than when I heard thee by our own fire-side First uttering without words a natural tune , When thou , a feeding babe , didst in thy joy Sing at thy Mother 's breast . Month follow 'd month , And in the open fields my life was pass 'd And in the mountains , else I think that thou Hadst been brought up upon thy father 's knees . — But we were playmates , Luke ; among these hills , As well thou know'st , in us the old and young Have play 'd together , nor with me didst thou Lack any pleasure which a boy can know .</p>
    <p n="48">Luke had a manly heart ; but at these words He sobb 'd aloud ; the Old Man grasp 'd his hand , And said , “ Nay do not take it so — I see That these are things of which I need not speak . — Even to the utmost I have been to thee A kind and a good Father : and herein I but repay a gift which I myself Receiv 'd at others ’ hands , for , though now old Beyond the common life of man , I still Remember them who lov 'd me in my youth . ”</p>
    <p n="49">Both of them sleep together : here they liv 'd As all their Forefathers had done , and when At length their time was come , they were not loth To give their bodies to the family mold . I wish 'd that thou should'st live the life they liv 'd . But ‘ tis a long time to look back , my Son , And see so little gain from sixty years . These fields were burthen 'd when they came to me ; ‘ Till I was forty years of age , not more Than half of my inheritance was mine .</p>
    <p n="50">“ I toil 'd and toil 'd ; God bless 'd me in my work , And ‘ till these three weeks past the land was free . — It looks as if it never could endure Another Master . Heaven forgive me , Luke , If I judge ill for thee , but it seems good That thou should'st go . ” At this the Old Man paus 'd , Then , pointing to the Stones near which they stood , Thus , after a short silence , he resum 'd : “ This was a work for us , and now , my Son , It is a work for me . But , lay one Stone — Here , lay it for me , Luke , with thine own hands . I for the purpose brought thee to this place . ”</p>
    <p n="51">Nay , Boy , be of good hope :— we both may live To see a better day . At eighty-four I still am strong and stout ;— do thou thy part , I will do mine .— I will begin again With many tasks that were resign 'd to thee ; Up to the heights , and in among the storms , Will I without thee go again , and do All works which I was wont to do alone , Before I knew thy face .— Heaven bless thee , Boy ! Thy heart these two weeks has been beating fast With many hopes — it should be so — yes — yes — I knew that thou could'st never have a wish To leave me , Luke , thou hast been bound to me Only by links of love , when thou art gone What will be left to us !— But , I forget My purposes . Lay now the corner-stone , As I requested , and hereafter , Luke , When thou art gone away , should evil men Be thy companions , let this Sheep-fold be Thy anchor and thy shield ; amid all fear And all temptation , let it be to thee An emblem of the life thy Fathers liv 'd , Who , being innocent , did for that cause Bestir them in good deeds . Now , fare thee well — When thou return'st , thou in this place wilt see A work which is not here , a covenant ‘ Twill be between us — but whatever fate Befall thee , I shall love thee to the last , And bear thy memory with me to the grave .</p>
    <p n="52">The Shepherd ended here ; and Luke stoop 'd down , And as his Father had requested , laid The first stone of the Sheep-fold ; at the sight The Old Man 's grief broke from him , to his heart He press 'd his Son , he kissed him and wept ; And to the House together they return 'd .</p>
    <p n="53">Next morning , as had been resolv 'd , the Boy Began his journey , and when he had reach 'd The public Way , he put on a bold face ; And all the Neighbours as he pass 'd their doors Came forth , with wishes and with farewell pray'rs , That follow 'd him ‘ till he was out of sight .</p>
    <p n="54">A good report did from their Kinsman come , Of Luke and his well-doing ; and the Boy Wrote loving letters , full of wond'rous news , Which , as the House-wife phrased it , were throughout The prettiest letters that were ever seen .</p>
    <p n="55">Both parents read them with rejoicing hearts . So , many months pass 'd on : and once again The Shepherd went about his daily work With confident and cheerful thoughts ; and now Sometimes when he could find a leisure hour He to that valley took his way , and there Wrought at the Sheep-fold . Meantime Luke began To slacken in his duty , and at length He in the dissolute city gave himself To evil courses : ignominy and shame Fell on him , so that he was driven at last To seek a hiding-place beyond the seas .</p>
    <p n="56">There is a comfort in the strength of love ; ‘ Twill make a thing endurable , which else Would break the heart :— Old Michael found it so . I have convers 'd with more than one who well Remember the Old Man , and what he was Years after he had heard this heavy news . His bodily frame had been from youth to age Of an unusual strength . Among the rocks He went , and still look 'd up upon the sun . And listen 'd to the wind ; and as before Perform 'd all kinds of labour for his Sheep , And for the land his small inheritance .</p>
    <p n="57">And to that hollow Dell from time to time Did he repair , to build the Fold of which His flock had need . ‘ Tis not forgotten yet The pity which was then in every heart For the Old Man — ands ‘ tis believ 'd by all That many and many a day he thither went , And never lifted up a single stone .</p>
    <p n="58">There , by the Sheep-fold , sometimes was he seen Sitting alone , with that his faithful Dog , Then old , beside him , lying at his feet . The length of full seven years from time to time He at the building of this Sheep-fold wrought , And left the work unfinished when he died .</p>
    <p n="59">Three years , or little more , did Isabel , Survive her Husband : at her death the estate Was sold , and went into a Stranger 's hand . The Cottage which was nam 'd The Evening Star Is gone , the ploughshare has been through the ground On which it stood ; great changes have been wrought In all the neighbourhood , yet the Oak is left That grew beside their Door ; and the remains Of the unfinished Sheep-fold may be seen Beside the boisterous brook of Green-head Gill .</p>

    <p n="61">NOTE I .</p>
    <p n="62">Page 26 — line 20 “ There were two springs that bubbled side by side . ” The impressive circumstance here described , actually took place some years ago in this country , upon an eminence called Kidstow Pike , one of the highest of the mountains that surround Hawes-water . The summit of the pike was stricken by lightning ; and every trace of one of the fountains disappeared , while the other continued to flow as before .</p>
    <p n="63">NOTE II .</p>
    <p n="64">Page 29 — line 5 “ The thought of death sits easy on the man , ” &amp; c. There is not any thing more worthy of remark in the manners of the inhabitants of these mountains , than the tranquillity , I might say indifference , with which they think and talk upon the subject of death . Some of the country church-yards , as here described , do not contain a single tombstone , and most of them have a very small number .</p>

    <p n="66">NOTE I .</p>
    <p n="67">Page 213 — line 14 “ There 's Richard Bateman , ” &amp; c. This story alluded to here is well known in the country . The chapel is called Ings Chapel ; and is on the right hand side of the road leading from Kendal to Ambleside .</p>
    <p n="68">NOTE II .</p>
    <p n="69">Page 217 — line 4 “ — had design 'd to build a sheep-fold . ” etc . It may be proper to inform some readers , that a sheep-fold in these mountains is an unroofed building of stone walls , with different divisions . It is generally placed by the side of a brook , for the convenience of washing the sheep ; but it is also useful as a shelter for them , and as a place to drive them into , to enable the shepherds conveniently to single out one or more for any particular purpose .</p>
