    <head>DEDICATION</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Bob Southey ! You 're a poet , poet laureate ,</l>
     <l n="2">And representative of all the race .</l>
     <l n="3">Although ‘ tis true that you turned out a Tory at</l>
     <l n="4">Last , yours has lately been a common case .</l>
     <l n="5">And now my epic renegade , what are ye at</l>
     <l n="6">With all the lakers , in and out of place ?</l>
     <l n="7">A nest of tuneful persons , to my eye</l>
     <l n="8">Like four and twenty blackbirds in a pye ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Which pye being opened they began to sing ’</l>
     <l n="10">( This old song and new simile holds good ) ,</l>
     <l n="11">‘ A dainty dish to set before the King ’</l>
     <l n="12">Or Regent , who admires such kind of food .</l>
     <l n="13">And Coleridge too has lately taken wing ,</l>
     <l n="14">But like a hawk encumbered with his hood ,</l>
     <l n="15">Explaining metaphysics to the nation .</l>
     <l n="16">I wish he would explain his explanation .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">You , Bob , are rather insolent , you know ,</l>
     <l n="18">At being disappointed in your wish</l>
     <l n="19">To supersede all warblers here below ,</l>
     <l n="20">And be the only blackbird in the dish .</l>
     <l n="21">And then you overstrain yourself , or so ,</l>
     <l n="22">And tumble downward like the flying fish</l>
     <l n="23">Gasping on deck , because you soar too high ,</l>
     <l n="24">Bob , And fall for lack of moisture quite a dry Bob .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">And Wordsworth in a rather long Excursion</l>
     <l n="26">( I think the quarto holds five hundred pages )</l>
     <l n="27">Has given a sample from the vasty version</l>
     <l n="28">Of his new system to perplex the sages .</l>
     <l n="29">‘ Tis poetry , at least by his assertion ,</l>
     <l n="30">And may appear so when the Dog Star rages ,</l>
     <l n="31">And he who understands it would be able</l>
     <l n="32">To add a story to the tower of Babel .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">You gentlemen , by dint of long seclusion</l>
     <l n="34">From better company , have kept your own</l>
     <l n="35">At Keswick , and through still continued fusion</l>
     <l n="36">Of one another 's minds at last have grown</l>
     <l n="37">To deem , as a most logical conclusion ,</l>
     <l n="38">That poesy has wreaths for you alone .</l>
     <l n="39">There is a narrowness in such a notion ,</l>
     <l n="40">Which makes me wish you 'd change your lakes for ocean .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="41">I would not imitate the petty thought ,</l>
     <l n="42">Nor coin my self-love to so base a vice ,</l>
     <l n="43">For all the glory your conversion brought ,</l>
     <l n="44">Since gold alone should not have been its price .</l>
     <l n="45">You have your salary ; was't for that you wrought ?</l>
     <l n="46">And Wordsworth has his place in the Excise .</l>
     <l n="47">You 're shabby fellows — true — but poets still</l>
     <l n="48">And duly seated on the immortal hill .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="49">Your bays may hide the baldness of your brows ,</l>
     <l n="50">Perhaps some virtuous blushes ; let them go .</l>
     <l n="51">To you I envy neither fruit nor boughs ,</l>
     <l n="52">And for the fame you would engross below ,</l>
     <l n="53">The field is universal and allows</l>
     <l n="54">Scope to all such as feel the inherent glow .</l>
     <l n="55">Scott , Rogers , Campbell , Moore , and Crabbe will try</l>
     <l n="56">‘ Gainst you the question with posterity .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="57">For me , who , wandering with pedestrian Muses ,</l>
     <l n="58">Contend not with you on the winged ’ steed ,</l>
     <l n="59">I wish your fate may yield ye , when she chooses ,</l>
     <l n="60">The fame you envy and the skill you need .</l>
     <l n="61">And recollect a poet nothing loses</l>
     <l n="62">In giving to his brethren their full meed</l>
     <l n="63">Of merit , and complaint of present days</l>
     <l n="64">Is not the certain path to future praise .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="65">He that reserves his laurels for posterity</l>
     <l n="66">( Who does not often claim the bright reversion )</l>
     <l n="67">Has generally no great crop to spare it , he</l>
     <l n="68">Being only injured by his own assertion .</l>
     <l n="69">And although here and there some glorious rarity</l>
     <l n="70">Arise like Titan from the sea 's immersion ,</l>
     <l n="71">The major part of such appellants go</l>
     <l n="72">To — God knows where — for no one else can know .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="73">If fallen in evil days on evil tongues ,</l>
     <l n="74">Milton appealed to the avenger , Time ,</l>
     <l n="75">If Time , the avenger , execrates his wrongs</l>
     <l n="76">And makes the word Miltonic mean sublime ,</l>
     <l n="77">He deigned not to belie his soul in songs ,</l>
     <l n="78">Nor turn his very talent to a crime .</l>
     <l n="79">He did not loathe the sire to laud the son ,</l>
     <l n="80">But closed the tyrant-hater he begun .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="81">Think'st thou , could he , the blind old man , arise</l>
     <l n="82">Like Samuel from the grave to freeze once more</l>
     <l n="83">The blood of monarchs with his prophecies ,</l>
     <l n="84">Or be alive again — again all hoar</l>
     <l n="85">With time and trials , and those helpless eyes</l>
     <l n="86">And heartless daughters — worn and pale and poor ,</l>
     <l n="87">Would he adore a sultan ? He obey</l>
     <l n="88">The intellectual eunuch Castlereagh ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="89">Cold-blooded , smooth-faced , placid miscreant !</l>
     <l n="90">Dabbling its sleek young hands in Erin 's gore ,</l>
     <l n="91">And thus for wider carnage taught to pant ,</l>
     <l n="92">Transferred to gorge upon a sister shore ,</l>
     <l n="93">The vulgarest tool that tyranny could want ,</l>
     <l n="94">With just enough of talent and no more ,</l>
     <l n="95">To lengthen fetters by another fixed</l>
     <l n="96">And offer poison long already mixed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="97">An orator of such set trash of phrase ,</l>
     <l n="98">Ineffably , legitimately vile ,</l>
     <l n="99">That even its grossest flatterers dare not praise ,</l>
     <l n="100">Nor foes — all nations — condescend to smile .</l>
     <l n="101">Not even a sprightly blunder 's spark can blaze</l>
     <l n="102">From that Ixion grindstone 's ceaseless toil ,</l>
     <l n="103">That turns and turns to give the world a notion</l>
     <l n="104">Of endless torments and perpetual motion .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="105">A bungler even in its disgusting trade ,</l>
     <l n="106">And botching , patching , leaving still behind</l>
     <l n="107">Something of which its masters are afraid ,</l>
     <l n="108">States to be curbed and thoughts to be confined ,</l>
     <l n="109">Conspiracy or congress to be made ,</l>
     <l n="110">Cobbling at manacles for all mankind ,</l>
     <l n="111">A tinkering slave-maker , who mends old chains ,</l>
     <l n="112">With God and man 's abhorrence for its gains .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="113">If we may judge of matter by the mind ,</l>
     <l n="114">Emasculated to the marrow , it</l>
     <l n="115">Hath but two objects , how to serve and bind ,</l>
     <l n="116">Deeming the chain it wears even men may fit ,</l>
     <l n="117">Eutropius of its many masters , blind</l>
     <l n="118">To worth as freedom , wisdom as to wit ,</l>
     <l n="119">Fearless , because no feeling dwells in ice ;</l>
     <l n="120">Its very courage stagnates to a vice .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="121">Where shall I turn me not to view its bonds ,</l>
     <l n="122">For I will never feel them . Italy ,</l>
     <l n="123">Thy late reviving Roman soul desponds</l>
     <l n="124">Beneath the lie this state-thing breathed o'er thee .</l>
     <l n="125">Thy clanking chain and Erin 's yet green wounds</l>
     <l n="126">Have voices , tongues to cry aloud for me .</l>
     <l n="127">Europe has slaves , allies , kings , armies still ,</l>
     <l n="128">And Southey lives to sing them very ill .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="129">Meantime , Sir Laureate , I proceed to dedicate</l>
     <l n="130">In honest simple verse this song to you .</l>
     <l n="131">And if in flattering strains I do not predicate ,</l>
     <l n="132">‘ Tis that I still retain my buff and blue ;</l>
     <l n="133">My politics as yet are all to educate .</l>
     <l n="134">Apostasy 's so fashionable too ,</l>
     <l n="135">To keep one creed 's a task grown quite</l>
     <l n="136">Herculean Is it not so , my Tory , ultra-Julian ?</l>

     <head>CANTO THE FIRST</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="18">
      <l n="137">I want a hero : an uncommon want ,</l>
      <l n="138">When every year and month sends forth a new one ,</l>
      <l n="139">Till , after cloying the gazettes with cant ,</l>
      <l n="140">The age discovers he is not the true one ;</l>
      <l n="141">Of such as these I should not care to vaunt ,</l>
      <l n="142">I ‘ ll therefore take our ancient friend Don Juan —</l>
      <l n="143">We all have seen him , in the pantomime ,</l>
      <l n="144">Sent to the devil somewhat ere his time .</l>

     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="23">
      <l n="177">Most epic poets plunge ‘ in medias res ’</l>
      <l n="178">( Horace makes this the heroic turnpike road ) ,</l>
      <l n="179">And then your hero tells , whene'er you please ,</l>
