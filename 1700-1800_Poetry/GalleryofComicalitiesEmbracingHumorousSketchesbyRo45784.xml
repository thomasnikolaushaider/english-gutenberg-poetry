    <docImprint>Most of the “ COMICALITIES ” here re-produced in fac simile first appeared in the columns of BELL 'S LIFE IN<settlement>LONDON</settlement>AND SPORTING CHRONICLE during the years<date>1827-8</date>and 9 , and caused an unprecedented increase in the weekly sale of that journal . As a painter of LIFE and NATURE , in all their truth and eccentricity , GEORGE CRUIKSHANK may be truly said to stand unrivalled , and to be only equalled , even in former times by the inimitable HOGARTH . The present Series has been principally selected from “ CRUIKSHANK 'S Illustrations of TIME and PHRENOLOGY , ” and his Illustrations to Mr. Wright 's “ MORNINGS AT BOW STREET ” and the sequel entitled “ MORE MORNINGS AT BOW STREET ” — works which are replete with wit and humour .</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>ROBERT CRUIKSHANK , the elder brother of George Cruikshank , Illustrated many books , &amp; c ., including Pierce Egan 's , “ THE FINISH to the Adventures of TOM , JERRY , and LOGIC , in their pursuits through LIFE in and out of London , ” 1827 . Died March 13 , 1856 . Aged 65 years .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>ROBERT SEYMOUR , a graphic humourist was born in<settlement>London</settlement>, about the year<date>1800</date>. He was apprenticed to Mr. Thomas Vaughan , a pattern-drawer in Spitalfields , and his practice in that department of art appears to have given him the facility and accuracy of pencil for which he was afterwards so distinguished . Within a very short period of fulfilling his term of apprenticeship , he commenced , on his own account , as a painter in oils , and must have been tolerably expert at that early age , as already in the spring of<date>1822</date>, we find him exhibiting a picture of some pretensions at the Royal Academy . He executed various other oil paintings about this period , but the more pressing demand on his talents was for drawings on wood , a mode of book illustration then in great vogue . The various illustrated books and periodicals published for the next ten or twelve years bespeak his popularity and industry in that department . Although Seymour 's hands were full of commissions for drawing on wood , he was always desirous of practice in a more independent department of art , feeling that the engraver , however competent , frequently failed to communicate the full force of his drawing . He , therefore , determined — where possible , on etching or engraving his own designs on copper or steel . He was very successful in full length sketches of public characters , and has left us many life-like portraits of members of the Turf and Drama between<date>1830</date>and<date>1836</date>. But of all Seymour 's various works his “ Humorous Sketches ” were his prime favourites , and will best perpetuate his name . They were first published between the years<date>1834</date>and<date>1836</date>, in detached prints at 3d . each , by Mr. Richard Carlisle , of Fleet Street . The entire collection was subsequently engraved on steel , and published in<date>1838</date>, with letterpress description by Crowquill ( Alfred Henry Forrester ) , the popular humourist of the day . Figaro in<settlement>London</settlement>— the popular predecessor of Punch , edited and published by Gilbert A'Beckett from December<date>1831</date>to<date>1836</date>— contains nearly 300 woodcuts after Seymour . They were also published separately as “ Seymour 's Caricature Gallery , ” and after his death were all re-published on six large sheets , each containing 20 subjects , as “ Seymour 's Comic Scrap Sheets . ” Seymour 's connection with the publication and illustration of the now famous Pickwick Papers is well known to the reading world by the printed statement of Mrs. Seymour , and Charles Dickens ’ own account of the origin of the Pickwick Papers , to need repetition .</docImprint>

   <p>We frequently meet with the pieman in old prints ; and in Hogarth 's “ March to Finchley , ” there he stands in the very centre of the crowd , grinning with delight at the adroitness of one robbery , while he is himself the victim of another . We learn from this admirable figure by the greatest painter of English life , that the pieman of the last century perambulated the streets in professional costume ; and we gather further , from the burly dimensions of his wares that he kept his trade alive by the laudable practice of giving “ a good pennyworth for a penny . ” Justice compels us to observe that his successors of a later generation have not been very conscientious observers of this maxim .</p>

   <p>In 1836 , Mr. T. D. Rice , who had previously appeared at the Surrey Theatre , in “ Bone Squash Diablo , ” made his first appearance at the Adelphi , in a farcical Burletta , called “ A Flight to America ; or , Twelve Hours in New York ” . The sketch , written for him by Mr. Leman Rede , introduced Rice as a nigger , Yates as a Frenchman , and Mrs. Stirling as Sally Snow — a coloured belle , Miss Daly , John Reeve , and Buckstone strengthened the cast . “ Jump Jim Crow ” caught the fancy of the town at once , and the familiar tune was soon to be heard everywhere . Rice stayed through the whole season , playing an engagement of twenty one weeks , then considered something extraordinary . For a long period he performed at the Adelphi and the Pavilion Theatres the same evening , and it was calculated that in so doing he had travelled considerably more than a thousand miles , while being encored five times at each theatre for 126 nights , it was easy to set down the figure of 1 , 260 as representing the number of times he had sung “ Jim Crow , ” during that period . Rice cleared by this engagement eleven hundred pounds . A street-ballad of the day informed the public that it could have :—</p>

     <l n="9">The heartless shrug , the cut direct ,</l>
     <l n="10">And bitter scorn and cold neglect ?—</l>
     <l n="11">Those glittering hopes so fondly cherished ,</l>
     <l n="12">In one ill-omen 'd night have perish 'd .</l>
     <l n="13">And Fate , in midnight 's deepest gloom ,</l>
     <l n="14">Have veil 'd our wretched Hero 's doom —</l>
     <l n="15">While Suicide is hovering near ,</l>
     <l n="16">To put her seal on Pug 's career .—</l>
     <l n="17">Stay thy rash hand ! ere to that hour</l>
     <l n="18">From which no Traveller can return .</l>
     <l n="19">All stain 'd with sin , unfit to die ,</l>
     <l n="20">Unsummon 'd you presume to fly !—</l>
     <l n="21">The tube is rais 'd , the die is cast —</l>
     <l n="22">Another moment is the last .</l>
     <l n="23">But , ere the awful scene is clos 'd ,</l>
     <l n="24">A guardian hand hath interpos 'd ;</l>
     <l n="25">And in this time of utmost need ,</l>
     <l n="26">See Mentor rush to stay the deed ,</l>
     <l n="27">And eagerly his arm extend</l>
     <l n="28">To snatch from death his wretched friend ,</l>
     <l n="29">Mentor , this act shall well atone</l>
     <l n="30">For many an error of thine own .</l>
