    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">“ THE BIRD AND INSECTS ’ POST-OFFICE ” was projected and written by ROBERT BLOOMFIELD , author of the “ Farmer 's Boy , ” &amp; c ., excepting Letters VIII ., X ., XI ., and XVI . by his eldest son , Charles . It was the author 's intention to publish it uniformly with his other juvenile work , the “ HISTORY OF LITTLE DAVY 'S NEW HAT , ” but he did not live to do so , and it was therefore included in his literary Remains , published in 1824 — a year after the poet 's death — in two volumes , price twelve shillings . Its circulation , in consequence , has been extremely limited , its form of publication preventing its introduction to children ; for this reason , and because I think it would be a pity for it to be shut up for ever in a dusty old volume from the little ones , for whom it was written , I have sent it forth in the form originally intended for it to assume .</p>
    <p n="2">The original manuscript , in the author 's autograph , I recently presented to the Trustees of the British Museum .</p>

AUTHOR 'S PREFACE . We all know that AEsop has made his birds and beasts talk , and reason too ; and that so well as still to make the volume bearing his name a favourite with thousands . Perhaps , too , we all know that same French author has objected to this method of teaching , alleging that children should not be imposed upon ( or something to that effect ) , and led to believe in the reality of talking birds and beasts . To me it appears plainly that they do not , nor are they inclined to , believe in any such reality . Observe two or three children at play with a favourite kitten . When one of them , in mere wantonness , shall give the little animal a rap on the nose , or a squeeze by the tail , the owner of the cat will instantly exclaim , “ Poor little pussy ! she does not like that , she says . ” Now , the child knows very well that the cat did not say a word about the matter , but she looked and acted as if she had , and that was enough . In the following pages I have endeavoured to make my winged and creeping correspondents talk in their own characters , according to their well-known habits and pursuits . I have added a few notes , sometimes of illustration , and sometimes of inquiry ; for , as natural history is almost a boundless field , I may stand in need of correction myself . It will be obvious that I have taken only some of the plainest and simplest subjects , for the purpose of trying whether any interest can be awakened in young minds by such means . And as I like to write for children , and think a great deal of information might be blended with amusement in this way , I hold myself acquitted of the charge of trifling and puerility , and am the young reader 's friend and well-wisher , R [ OBERT ] B [ LOOMFIELD . ] THE BIRD AND INSECT 'S POST-OFFICE .</titlePart></docTitle>

    <head>LITTLE JABBERER ,</head>
     <l n="1">I have many times thought of addressing to you a few words of advice , as</l>
     <l n="2">you seem to stand in need of such a friend .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>You know that I do not stand much upon ceremony ; I am always ready for talking and for giving advice , and really wonder how other birds can keep themselves so quiet . Then you will pardon my frankness , since you know my character , when I inform you that I think you remarkably tame and spiritless : you have no enterprise in you . In an old farmyard , shuffling amongst the straw , there you may be found morning , noon and night ; and you are never seen in the woods and groves with me and my companions , where we have the blessing of free liberty , and fly where we please . You must often have heard me sing ; that cannot be doubted , because I am heard a great way . As to me , I never come down to your farm , unless I think I can find a hen 's egg or two amongst the nettles , or a chicken or duck just hatched .</p>
   <p>I earnestly advise you to change your manner of life and take a little free air , as I do . Stop no longer in your dull yard , feeding upon pigs ’ leavings , but come abroad with me . But I must have done till a better opportunity ; for the gamekeeper with his gun has just turned the corner . Take my advice , and you may be as well off , and learn to sing as well as I do .</p>
   <p>Yours , in great haste ,</p>

   <p>I was hopping along the top ridge of the house when I received your insolent and conceited epistle , which does you no credit , but is very much in your usual style . “ Little Jabberer ” indeed ! and pray , what is your letter of advice ? Nothing but jabber from beginning to end . You sing , you say . I have heard you often enough ; but if yours is singing , then I must be allowed to be no judge of the matter . You say you are afraid of the gamekeeper ; this , perhaps , allows some sense in you , for he is paid for killing all kinds of vermin .</p>

   <p>And so you come down to our farm when you think you can steal something ! Thus , if I did not hide my eggs and my young ones , in a hole too small for you to enter , I can see pretty plainly how I should come off with your thieving and your advice .</p>
   <p>Be advised in your turn ; keep away from our yard , for my master has a gun too ; and your chattering , which I suppose you call singing , he abominably hates . You will be in danger of catching what the gamekeeper threatens , and then where is the great difference between your station and mine ?</p>
   <p>From my lodging under the thatch of the stable , I am , as you may happen to behave yourself ,</p>

    <head>LETTER III .</head>
    <head>FROM A YOUNG GARDEN-SPIDER TO HER MOTHER .</head>
    <head>DEAR MOTHER ,</head>
    <head>I cannot exactly tell what happened before I came out of the shell ; but , from circumstances , I can give you some information . When I came to life , amongst some scores of other little merry yellow creatures , I found myself , and all of us , enclosed in a thing , through which we , with our eight eyes , could see very well , but could not instantly get out . I soon perceived that we , in the egg state , wrapped in a white bag , as you left us , had been put into a thing called a bottle , by one of those great creatures whom we always call striders ; but this was a particular one of that tribe , who wanted to play tricks with us — one whom they would perhaps call a philosopher .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Well , his own sense ( if he had any ) told him that we could not live without air ; so he left the cork out , and went about his business ; no doubt of much less consequence than the lives of all us prisoners — but that they do not mind . But how long were we prisoners ? Why , as soon as ever we were out of the shell we began to spin , and linked our webs so thick together that the philosopher 's bottle would hold us no longer . We climbed out in a crowd , and spread our webs over the room , up to the very ceiling . I shall never forget how the great booby stared when he saw us all climbing up our own rope-ladders ! I wonder if those great creatures are not sometimes caught in webs spun by their fellow-creatures , and whether they are not sometimes put by hundreds into a bottle without possessing any means of escape ? But I am but a child , and must live and learn before I talk more freely . Long life to you , dear mother , and plenty of flies .</head>

    <head>NEIGHBOUR ,</head>
    <head>When we last met you seemed very lively and agreeable , but you asked an abundance of questions , and particularly wanted to know whether we nightingales really do , as is said of us , cross the great water every year , and return in the spring to sing in your English groves . Now , as I am but young , I must be modest , and not prate about what I cannot as yet understand . I must say , nevertheless , that I never heard my parents talk of any particular long journey which they had performed to reach this country , or that they should return , and take me and the rest of the family with them , at this particular time or season . I know this , that I never saw my parents fly further at one flight than from one side of a field to another or from one grove to the next . Who are they who call us “ birds of passage ” ?<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>They certainly may know more of the extent of the GREAT WATERS than we can , neighbour Wren ; but have they considered our powers , and the probability of what they assert ? I am sure , if my parents should call on me to go with them , I shall be flurried out of my life . But it is my business to obey . I have so lately got my feathers , that I cannot be a proper judge of the matter . As to the swallows and many other birds going to a vast distance , there is no wonder in that , if you look at their wings ; but how would you , for instance , perform such a journey — you who , even when you sing , put yourself into a violent passion , as if you had not a minute to live ? We nightingales are the birds for song . This you will acknowledge , I dare say , though I have not begun yet . I will give you a specimen when I come back ( if I am really to go ) , and you will hear me in “ Home Wood ” when it is dark , and you have crept into your little nest in the hovel .</head>

   <p>LETTER V .</p>
   <p>FROM AN EARWIG , DEPLORING THE LOSS OF ALL HER CHILDREN .</p>
   <p>DEAR AUNT ,</p>
   <p>You cannot think how distressed I have been , and still am ; for , under the bark of a large elm , which , I dare say , has stood there a great while , I had placed my whole family , where they were dry , comfortable , and , as I foolishly thought , secure . But only mark what calamities may fall upon earwigs before they are aware of them ! I had just got my family about me , all white , clean , and promising children , when pounce came down that bird they call a woodpecker ; when , thrusting his huge beak under the bark where we lay , down went our whole sheltering roof ! and my children , poor things , running , as they thought , from danger , were devoured as fast as the destroyer could open his beak and shut it . For my own part , I crept into a crack in the solid tree , where I have thus far escaped ; but as this bird can make large holes into solid timber , I am by no means safe .</p>
   <p>This calamity is the more heavy , as it carries with it a great disappointment ; for very near our habitation was a high wall , the sunny side of which was covered with the most delicious fruits — peaches , apricots , nectarines , &amp; c .— all just then ripening ; and I thought of having such a feast with my children as I had never enjoyed in my life .</p>
   <p>I am surrounded by woodpeckers , jackdaws , magpies , and other devouring creatures , and think myself very unfortunate . Yet , perhaps , if I could know the situation of some larger creatures — I mean particularly such as would tread me to death if I crossed their path — they may have complaints to make as well as I .</p>
   <p>Take care of yourself , my good old aunt , and I shall keep in my hiding-place as long as starvation will permit , And , after all , perhaps the fruit was not so delicious as it looked — I am resolved to think so , just to comfort myself .</p>
   <p>Yours , with compliments , as usual .</p>

    <head>FROM THE WILD DUCK TO THE TAME DUCK .</head>
     <l n="1">Dated Lincoln and Ely Fens .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>DEAR COUSIN ,</head>
    <head>I suppose I must call you so , though I declare I know not how we are related . But , though I am thought so very wild and shy , I have still a kind of fellow-feeling for you ; and , if you have not gone to the spit before this comes to you , I should be glad of your reply in a friendly way . You know very well that you are intended to be eaten , and so are we — when they can catch us . I understand that you never fly and that you seldom waddle above a meadow 's length from your pond , where you keep puddling and groping from daylight till dark . This , I assure you , is not the life that I lead . We fly together in vast numbers in the night , for many miles over this flat , wet country ; so , as to water , we have an inexhaustible store : we may swim ourselves tired . But , I dare say , every station of our duck-lives is subject to some disadvantages and some calamities . Thus , with all our wildness , we are not secure ; for we are taken sometimes by hundreds in a kind of trap which is called a decoy .</head>
     <l n="1">[ Illustration : WILD DUCKS . ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Some of our tribe have been made tame like you ( but I hope you are not so false-hearted ) , and then their masters feed them plentifully , in a place contrived on purpose , with a narrow entrance , with which these traitor ducks are well acquainted , so that they can pass in and out at a place we strangers should never have thought of . They are sent out in the dusk of the evening , when they soon join with large companies of us strangers ; and knowing , as they do , their way home , and that they shall find food , they set off , close at each other 's tails , along a ditch , or watercourse , and we fools follow them .</p>
   <p>The entrance , as far as I could see of it , is very narrow ; for I have been twice within a hair 's breadth of being caught , and do not pretend to know all about it ; but I wish heartily that every duck and drake in the country — ay , and every one of our allies , the geese , too , could say as much — could say that “ they had twice been on the verge of destruction by keeping bad company , but had escaped . ”</p>
   <p>What becomes of my companions , when taken , I think I have heard pretty accurately ; for there is somewhere a very large assemblage of fellow-creatures to those who catch us , and whose demand seems never to be satisfied . Well , never mind , cousin ; I am determined to fly , and swim too , as long as I can , and I advise you to do the same , and make the most of your day .</p>
   <p>Hoping to hear from you , I am , affectionately , your wild cousin .</p>

    <head>LETTER VII .</head>
    <head>THE TAME DUCK 'S REPLY .</head>
    <head>COUSIN WILDING ,</head>
    <head>I confess I did not at all expect to hear from you ; for I always believed you to be one of those thoughtless young creatures which are to be found in other stations of life as well as in yours and mine , who , as soon as they get fledged and able to get abroad , care no more for their parents and those who brought them up than I care for a shower of rain . However , you have escaped danger twice , and you have reason to congratulate yourself . I have been sitting here upon ten eggs for three weeks past , and of course have another week to be confined ; but then the thoughts of the pleasure I shall have in hatching and guiding my young ones to the water , is ample payment for all my pains . They will look so clean and so delighted , and will do as they are bid by the smallest quack that I can utter , that I must be a bad mother indeed if I am not proud of them . Perhaps you will wonder when I tell you that we have a creature here — fledged indeed — which is called a hen ; a strange , cackling , flying , useless , noisy , silly creature , which is as much afraid of water as you are of your decoy . I have often known one of these birds to hatch nine or ten of my eggs ; and then , if you wanted to ridicule the lifted foot of conceit , and the dignity of assumed importance , you should see her lead her young , or more properly , see the young lead her to the nearest water they can find . In they go , and she begins to call and scold , and run round the edge to save them from drowning ! Now , what fools these hens must be compared to us ducks ! at least , I , for one , am determined to think so . I have seen this same hen with the brood about her scratching in our farmyard with all her might ; when , not considering who was behind her , or who under her feathers , she has tricked away one little yellow duck with one of her claws , and another with the other , till I wished I had her in a pond ; I would have given her a good sousing , depend upon it . But really , cousin , do n't you think that this way of contradicting our natures and propensities is very wrong ? Suppose , for instance , I should sit upon a dozen of that silly creature 's eggs which I mentioned above — for I will never consent to have them matched with us — I should then , to be sure , have a week 's holiday , as they sit but three weeks ; but what should I bring to light ? a parcel of little , useless , tip-toed , cowardly things , that would not follow me into the pond — I cannot bear to think of it . I have written you a long letter , and can think of no more but Quack ! quack ! quack ! and farewell .</head>

    <head>FROM THE DUNGHILL-COCK TO THE CHAFFINCH .</head>
    <head>I have often , during the spring and summer , heard you of a morning piping away in the hedges , sometimes as soon as I was up myself , and thought your singing pretty fair , and that you conducted yourself as you ought to do . But this I cannot say lately ; for it is quite overstepping the bounds of decency and good manners when you and your brother pilferers , now the winter is come , make it your daily practice to come by scores , as you do , into our yard , and , without any ceremony , eat up all the barley you can lay your beaks to . I suppose when the spring comes again , and you find more to satisfy you outside a farmyard than within , you will be off to the hedges again . I shall let you alone , unless the barley runs short , which is to support my wives and children ; when if you still venture to continue your pilferings , you must not be surprised should some of you feel the weight of my displeasure .</head>

    <head>( CHARLES BLOOMFIELD . )</head>
     <l n="1">Excuse , Mr. Bee , this epistle , to one</l>
     <l n="2">Whose time , from the earliest gleam of the sun</l>
     <l n="3">Till he sinks in the west , is so busily spent ,</l>
     <l n="4">That I fear I intrude ;— but I write with intent</l>
     <l n="5">To save your whole city from pillage and ruin ,</l>
     <l n="6">And to warn you in time of a plot that is brewing .</l>
     <l n="7">Last night , when , as usual , enjoying the hour</l>
     <l n="8">When the gloaming had spread , and a trickling shower</l>
     <l n="9">Was beading the grass as it silently fell ,</l>
     <l n="10">And day with reluctance was bidding farewell ;</l>
     <l n="11">When down by yon hedge , nearly opposite you ,</l>
     <l n="12">And your City of Honey , as proudly I threw</l>
     <l n="13">The rays from my lamp in a magical round ;</l>
     <l n="14">I listened , alarmed upon hearing the sound</l>
     <l n="15">Of human intruders approaching more near ;</l>
     <l n="16">But I presently found I had nothing to fear ,</l>
     <l n="17">For the hedge was between us , and I and my gleam</l>
     <l n="18">Lay hid from their view : when the following scheme</l>
     <l n="19">I heard , as they sheltered beneath the old tree ,</l>
     <l n="20">And send you each creature 's own words , Mr. Bee :—</l>
     <l n="21">“ See , Jack , there it is ; now suppose you and I ,</l>

     <l n="23">Some night , when we 're sure all the bees are at rest ,</l>
     <l n="24">To smother them all , and then dig out the nest . ”</l>
     <l n="25">“ I know we can do it , ” said Jack with delight ;</l>
     <l n="26">“ I can n't come to-morrow ; but s'pose the next night</l>
     <l n="27">We both set about it , if you are inclined ;</l>
     <l n="28">And then we will halve all the honey we find ? ”</l>
     <l n="29">“ Agreed , ” said the other , “ but let us be gone . ”</l>
     <l n="30">And they left me in thought until early this morn ;</l>
     <l n="31">When I certainly meant , if your worship had stay 'd</l>
     <l n="32">But a minute or two , till my speech I had made ,</l>
     <l n="33">To have saved you the reading , as well as the cost</l>
     <l n="34">Of a letter by post — but my words were all lost ;</l>
     <l n="35">For though they were lavished each time you came near ,</l>
     <l n="36">Or was close overhead , and I thought you should hear ,</l>
     <l n="37">Yet the buzz of importance , as onward you flew ,</l>
     <l n="38">Bobbing into each flower the whole meadow through ,</l>
     <l n="39">So baffled your brains that I let you alone ,</l>
     <l n="40">For I found that I might as well speak to a drone :</l>
     <l n="41">Yet , rather than quietly leave you to fate</l>
     <l n="42">( Such a villainous thought never entered my pate ) ,</l>
     <l n="43">I send you this letter , composed by the light</l>
     <l n="44">Of my silvery lamp in the dead of the night ,</l>
     <l n="45">And about the same time , and the very same place ,</l>
     <l n="46">That a few nights ago , when the moon hid her face ,</l>
     <l n="47">I beheld , nearly hid in the grass as I lay ,</l>
     <l n="48">And my lamp in full splendour reflecting its ray</l>
     <l n="49">In the eye of each dewdrop , the fairies unseen</l>
     <l n="50">To all human vision , trip here with their Queen ,</l>
     <l n="51">To pay me a visit , to dance and to feast ;</l>
     <l n="52">And their revels continued , till full in the east</l>
     <l n="53">The sun tinged the clouds for another bright day ,</l>
     <l n="54">When each took the warning and bounded away :</l>
     <l n="55">‘ Tis the same at this moment . Farewell , Mr. Hum ,</l>
     <l n="56">I 've extinguished my lamp , for the morning is come .</l>

    <head>LETTER XII .</head>
    <head>FROM THE PIGEON TO THE PARTRIDGE .</head>
    <head>What a long time it is since I received your kind letter about the ripening corn , and the dangers you were presently to be subject to with all your children !</head>
     <l n="1">[ Illustration : PIGEONS . ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>You will think me very idle , or very unfeeling , if I delay answering you any longer ; I will therefore tell you some of my own troubles , to convince you that I have had causes of delay , which you can have no notion of until I explain them . You must know , then , that we are subject to more than the random gun-shot in the field , for we are sometimes taken out of our house a hundred at a time , and put into a large basket to be placed in a meadow or spare plat of ground suiting the purpose , there to be murdered at leisure . This they call “ shooting from the trap ,"[ 3 ] and is done in this way :</p>
   <p>We being imprisoned , as I have said , as thick as we can stand in the basket , a man is placed by us to take us out singly , and carry us to a small box , at the distance of fifty or sixty yards ; this box has a lid , to which is attached a string , by means of which , he , the man ( if he is a man ) can draw up the lid and let us fly at a signal given . Every sensible pigeon of course flies for his life , for , ranged on each side , stand from two to four or six men with guns , who fire as the bird gets upon the wing ; and the cleverest fellows are those who can kill most ;— and this they call sport !</p>
   <figure>
    <p>PARTRIDGES .</p>
   </figure>
   <p>I have sad cause to know how this sport is conducted , for I have been in the trap myself . Only one man , or perhaps a boy , fired at me as I rose ; but I received two wounds , for one shot passed through my crop , but I was astonished to find how soon it got well ; the other broke my leg just below the feathers . Oh , what anguish I suffered for two months ! at the end of which time it withered and dropped off . So now , instead of running about amongst my red-legged brethren , as a pigeon ought , I am obliged to hop like a sparrow . But only consider what glory this stripling must have acquired , to have actually fired a gun and broke a pigeon 's leg ! Well , we both know , neighbour Partridge , what the Hawk is ; he stands for no law , nor no season , but eats us when he is hungry . He is a perfect gentleman compared to these “ Lords of the Creation , ” as I am told they call themselves ; and I declare to you upon the honour of a pigeon , that I had much rather be torn to pieces by the Hawk than be shut up in a box at a convenient distance to be shot at by a dastard . You partridges are protected during great part of the year by severe laws , but whether such laws are wise , merciful , or just , I cannot determine , but I know that they are strictly kept and enforced by those who make them . Take care of yourself , for the harvest is almost ripe .</p>

    <head>I write to you in the fulness of my heart , for I have been grossly insulted by the Magpie , in a letter received this morning ; in which I am abused for what my forefathers did long before I was born . I know of nothing more base , or more unjust , than thus raking up old quarrels<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>and reproaching those who had nothing to do with them . The letter must have come through your office , but I know you have not the authority to break open and examine letters passing between those who should be friends ; I therefore do not accuse you ; but sometimes the heart is relieved by stating its troubles even when no redress can be expected . I know that you cannot bring to punishment that slanderer , that babbler of the woods , any more than I can ; but I wish you would give me a word of comfort , if it is ever so short .</head>

   <p>THE OWL IN REPLY TO THE WOOD-PIGEON .</p>
   <p>DISTRESSED NEIGHBOUR ,</p>
   <p>I am sorry for your trouble , but cheer up your spirits , and though you are insulted , remember who it is that gives the affront , it is only the magpie ; and depend upon it that in general the best way to deal with impudent fools is to be silent and take no notice of them . I should have enough to do if I were to resent all her impertinences . She will come sometimes round the ivy where I lodge in the old elm , or into the tower on the top of the hill ; and there she will pimp and pry into my private concerns , and mob me , and call me “ Old Wigsby ” and “ Doctor Winkum , ” and such kind of names , and all for nothing . I assure you it is well for her that she is not a mouse , or she should not long escape my talons ; but who ever heard of such a thing as eating a magpie ? I live chiefly on mice ( when I am at liberty to catch them ) , but I have my complaints to make as well as you , for you know I hold a high situation in the Post-office , and I suppose you know , likewise , that the letters are brought in so very late that it often takes me half the night to sort them , and night is the very time when I ought to get my own food ! At this rate of going on , and if the cats are industrious as usual , there will not be a mouse left for me , if I do not give up my place .</p>
   <p>I have heard that my family are famed for wisdom ; but for my part I will not boast of any such thing : yet I am wise enough to know that other people in high offices expect either a good salary or perquisites , as a reward for their labour , or what is easier still , somebody to do all the work for them . If I hold in my present mind until next quarter , I will certainly send in my resignation . Thus you see what an important thing it is to suit the person to the office , or the office to the person on whom it is conferred ; for had the magpie , for instance , been secretary , every one of the letters would have been peeped into , for a certainty , for nothing can escape her curiosity . I will try to bear with my situation a little longer , and believe me to be</p>

    <head>DEAR LITTLE BOB ,</head>
    <head>I remember your peaceful singing on the top of your shed , near my late dwelling , and I remember also that I promised to write you some account of my journey . You may recollect that , at the close of your summer , when flies became scarce , we all assembled on a sunny morning , on the roof of the highest building in the village , and talked loudly of the flight we intended to take . At last came the day appointed , and we mounted up in a vast body and steered southward .</head>
     <l n="1">[ Illustration : SWALLOWS . ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Being hatched in England , I had thought your valleys and streams matchless in beauty ; and for anything I know to the contrary they certainly are ; but I am now a traveller , and have a traveller 's privilege to say what I like . When we reached the great water I was astonished at its width , but more still to see many travelling houses going at a prodigious rate , and sending forth from iron chimneys columns of black smoke over the face of the water , reaching further than you ever flew in your life ; they have a contrivance on each side which puts the waves all in commotion , but they are not wings . My mother says that in old times , when swallows came to England , there were no such things to be seen . We crossed this water , and a fine sunny country beyond it , until I was tired , and we now found flies more abundant , though the oldest amongst us assure me that we must travel further still , over another wide water , into a country where men 's faces are of the same colour as my feathers , black and tawny ; but travellers see strange things . When I come to England again I will endeavour to find out your village .<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>I hope , for your sake , you may have a mild winter and good lodgings . This is all the news worth sending , and I must catch flies for myself now , you know .</p>

     <l n="3">To welcome a season so lovely and gay —</l>
     <l n="4">But a scene the most sweet was the close of May-day .</l>
     <l n="5">For the air was serene , and the moon was out bright ,</l>
     <l n="6">And Philomel boldly exerted her might</l>
     <l n="7">In her swellings and trillings , to rival the sound</l>
     <l n="8">Of the distant defiance of nightingales round .</l>
     <l n="9">While the cuckoo as proudly was heard to prolong ,</l>
     <l n="10">Though daylight was over , her own mellow song ,</l>
     <l n="11">And appeared to exult ; and at intervals , too ,</l>
     <l n="12">The owl in the distance joined in with “ Too-whoo ! ”</l>
     <l n="13">Unceasing , unwearied , each , proud of his power ,</l>
     <l n="14">Continued the contest from hour to hour ;</l>
     <l n="15">The nightingale vaunting — the owl in reply —</l>
     <l n="16">With the cuckoo 's response — till the moon from the sky</l>
     <l n="17">Was hastening down to the west , and the dawn</l>
     <l n="18">Was spreading the east ; and the owl in the morn</l>
     <l n="19">Sat silently winking his eyes at the sight ;</l>
     <l n="20">And the nightingale also had bidden “ good-night . ”</l>
     <l n="21">The cuckoo , left solus , continued with glee ,</l>
     <l n="22">His notes of defeat from his favourite tree ;</l>
     <l n="23">At length he departed ; but still as he flew ,</l>
     <l n="24">Was heard his last notes of defiance , “ Cuckoo ! ”</l>

    <head>NOTES :</head>
    <p n="1"><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>This part of the letter is very difficult of translation , as the plain word , in spiders ’ language , means merely “ a deep one . ” — R. B .</p>
    <p n="2"><span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Cowper , that excellent man and poet , and close observer of nature , writes as follows to his friend , on the 11th of March , 1792 :—</p>
    <p n="3">“ TO JOHN JOHNSON , ESQ .</p>
    <p n="4">“ You talk of primroses that you pulled on Candlemas Day , but what think you of me , who heard a nightingale on New Year 's Day ? Perhaps I am the only man in England who can boast of such good fortune . Good indeed ! for if was at all an omen , it could not be an unfavourable one . The winter , however , is now making himself amends , and seems the more peevish for having been encroached on at so undue a season . Nothing less than a large slice out of the spring will satisfy him . ”</p>
    <p n="5">He adds the following lines on the occasion :—</p>
    <p n="6">“ TO THE NIGHTINGALE , WHICH THE AUTHOR HEARD SING ON NEW YEAR 'S DAY , 1792 .</p>
    <p n="7">“ Whence is it that amazed I hear From yonder wither 'd spray , This foremost morn of all the year , The melody of May ?</p>
    <p n="8">“ And why , since thousands would be proud Of such a favour shown , Am I selected from the crowd , To witness it alone ?</p>
    <p n="9">“ Sing'st thou , sweet Philomel , to me , For that I also long Have practised in the groves like thee , Though not like thee in song ?</p>
    <p n="10">“ Or , sing'st thou rather under force Of some divine command , Commissioned to presage a course Of happier days at hand ?</p>
    <p n="11">“ Thrice welcome then ! for many a long And joyless year have I , As thou to-day , put forth my song Beneath a wintry sky .</p>
    <p n="12">“ But thee no wintry skies can harm , Who only need'st to sing To make e'en January charm , And every season spring .</p>
    <p n="13">R. B . ”</p>
    <p n="14"><span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>I once witnessed this silly and barbarous sport , and saw at least a score of maimed and wounded birds upon the barns , and stables , and outhouses of the village . I was utterly disgusted , and it required a strong effort of the mind to avoid wishing that one of the gunners at least had hobbled off the ground with a dangling leg , which might for one half-year have reminded him of the cowardly practice of “ shooting from the trap . ” — R.

    <p n="15"><span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>The poor pigeon , I think , must here allude to the old well-known quarrel between the two families about building their nests . The magpie once undertook to teach the pigeon how to build a more substantial and commodious dwelling , and certainly it would have become the learner to have observed her progress , and not interrupt the teacher ; but the pigeon kept on her usual cry , “ Take two , Taffy , take two ” ( for thus it is translated in Suffolk ) , but Mag insisted this was wrong , and that one stick at a time was quite enough ; still the pigeon kept on her cry , “ Take two , take two , ” until the teacher in a violent passion gave up the undertaking , exclaiming , “ I say that one at a time is plenty , and if you think otherwise , you may act about the work yourself , for I will have no more to do with it . ” Since that time the wood-pigeon has built a wretched nest , sure enough , so thin that you may frequently see her two eggs through it , and if not placed near the body of a tree , or on strong branches , it is often thrown down by the wind , or the eggs rolled out ; yet the young of this bird , before they are half grown , will defend themselves against any intruder , at which time the parent bird will dash herself down amongst the standing corn or high grass , and behave as though her wings were broken , and she was utterly disabled ; and this she does to draw off the enemy from her young ; so that this bird is not so foolish as Mag would make us believe .— R .

It has been said that , instead of flying to southern countries , where they can find food and a congenial climate , they dive into the waters of a bog , and lie in a torpid state , through the winter , round the roots of flags and weeds .— R .
