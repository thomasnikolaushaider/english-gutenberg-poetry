    <docTitle><titlePart>THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS ( A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS ) By Clement Clarke Moore</titlePart></docTitle>
   </titlePage>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>‘ Twas the night before Christmas , when all through the house Not a creature was stirring , not even a mouse ; The stockings were hung by the chimney with care , In hopes that ST. NICHOLAS soon would be there ; The children were nestled all snug in their beds , While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads ; And mamma in her ‘ kerchief , and I in my cap , Had just settled down for a long winter 's nap , When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter , I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter . Away to the window I flew like a flash , Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash . The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below , When , what to my wondering eyes should appear , But a miniature sleigh , and eight tiny reindeer , With a little old driver , so lively and quick , I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick . More rapid than eagles his coursers they came , And he whistled , and shouted , and called them by name ; “ Now , DASHER ! now , DANCER ! now , PRANCER and VIXEN ! On , COMET ! on CUPID ! on , DONDER and BLITZEN ! To the top of the porch ! to the top of the wall ! Now dash away ! dash away ! dash away all ! ” As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly , When they meet with an obstacle , mount to the sky , So up to the house-top the coursers they flew , With the sleigh full of toys , and St. Nicholas too . And then , in a twinkling , I heard on the roof The prancing and pawing of each little hoof . As I drew in my hand , and was turning around , Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound . He was dressed all in fur , from his head to his foot , And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot ; A bundle of toys he had flung on his back , And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack . His eyes — how they twinkled ! his dimples how merry ! His cheeks were like roses , his nose like a cherry ! His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow , And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow ; The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth , And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath ; He had a broad face and a little round belly , That shook , when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly . He was chubby and plump , a right jolly old elf , And I laughed when I saw him , in spite of myself ; A wink of his eye and a twist of his head , Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread ; He spoke not a word , but went straight to his work , And filled all the stockings ; then turned with a jerk , And laying his finger aside of his nose , And giving a nod , up the chimney he rose ; He sprang to his sleigh , to his team gave a whistle , And away they all flew like the down of a thistle . But I heard him exclaim , ere he drove out of sight , “ HAPPY CHRISTMAS TO ALL , AND TO ALL A GOOD-NIGHT . ”</p>
