    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">Giacomo Leopardi is a great name in Italy among philosophers and poets , but is quite unknown in this country , and Mr. Townsend has the honor of introducing him , in the most captivating way , to his countrymen . In Germany and France he has excited attention . Translations have been made of his works ; essays have been written on his ideas . But in England his name is all but unheard of . Six or seven years ago Mr. Charles Edwards published a translation of the essays and dialogues , but no version of the poems has appeared , so far as I know . Leopardi was substantially a poet ,— that is to say , he had imagination , sentiment , passion , an intense love of beauty , a powerful impulse towards things ideal . The sad tone of his speculations about the universe and human destiny gave an impression of mournfulness to his lines , but this rather deepened the pathos of his work . In the same breath he sang of love and the grave , and the love was the more eager for its brevity . He had the poetic temperament — sensitive , ardent , aspiring . He possessed the poetic aspect — the broad white brow , the large blue eyes . Some compared him to Byron , but the resemblance was external merely . In ideas , purpose , feeling , he was entirely unlike the Englishman ; in the energy and fire of his style only did he somewhat resemble him . Worshippers have even ventured to class him with Dante , a comparison which shows , at least , in what estimation the poet could be held at home , and how largely the patriotic sentiment entered into the conception of poetical compositions , how necessary it was that the singer should be a bard . His verses ranged over a large field . They were philosophic , patriotic , amorous . There are odes , lyrics , satires , songs ; many very beautiful and feeling ; all noble and earnest . His three poems , “ All ’ Italia , ” “ Sopra il Monumento di Dante , ” “ A Angelo Mai , ” gave him a national reputation . They touch the chords to which he always responded — patriotism , poetry , learning , a national idealism bearing aloft an enormous weight of erudition and thought .</p>
    <p n="2">Leopardi was born at Recanati , a small town about fifteen miles from Ancona , in 1798 . He was of noble parentage , though not rich . His early disposition was joyous , but with the feverish joy of a highly-strung , nervous organization . He was a great student from boyhood ; and severe application undermined a system that was never robust , and that soon became hopelessly diseased . Illness , accompanied with sharp pain , clipped the wings of his ambition , obliged him to forego preferment , and deepened the hopelessness that hung over his expectations . His hunger for love could not be satisfied , for his physical infirmity rendered a union undesirable , even if possible , while a craving ideality soon transcended any visible object of affection . He had warm friends of his own sex , one of whom , Antonio Ranieri , stayed by him in all vicissitudes , took him to Naples , and closed his eyes , June 14 , 1837 .</p>
    <p n="3">To this acute sensibility of frame must be added the torture of the heart arising from a difference with his father , who , as a Catholic , was disturbed by the skeptical tendencies of his son , and the perpetual irritation of a conflict with the large majority of even philosophical minds . An early death might have been anticipated . No amount of hopefulness , of zest for life , of thirst for opportunity , of genius for intellectual productiveness will counteract such predisposition to decay . The death of the body , however , has but ensured a speedier immortality of the soul ; for many a thinker has since been busy in gathering up the fragments of his mind and keeping his memory fresh . His immense learning has been forgotten . His archæological knowledge , which fascinated Niebuhr , is of small account to-day . But his speculative and poetical genius is a permanent illumination .</p>
    <p n="4">Mr. Townsend , the translator , well known in New York , where he was born , lived ten years in Italy , and seven in Rome . He was a studious , thoughtful man ; quiet , secluded , scholarly ; an eminent student of Italian literature ; a real sympathizer with Italian progress . By the cast of his mind and the course of his inward experience he was drawn towards Leopardi . His version adheres as closely to the original as is compatible with elegance and the preservation of metrical grace . He has not rendered into English all Leopardi 's poems , but he has presented the best of them , enough to give an idea of his author 's style of feeling and expression . What he has done , has been performed faithfully . It is worth remarking that he was attracted by the intense longing of the poet for love and appreciation , and by keen sympathy with his unhappy condition . It is needless to say that he did not share the pessimism that imparts a melancholy hue to the philosopher 's own doctrine , and that might have been modified if not dispelled by a different experience . The translation was finished at Siena , the summer of the earthquake , and was the last work Mr. Townsend ever did , the commotion outside not interrupting him , or causing him to suspend his application .</p>

   <p>Dedication .</p>
   <note>From the first Florentine Edition of the Poems , in the year 1831 .</note>
   <p>To my Friends in Tuscany :</p>
   <p>My dear Friends , I dedicate this book to you , in which , as is oft the case with Poets , I have sought to illustrate my sorrow , and with which I now — I cannot say it without tears — take leave of Literature and of my studies . I hoped these dear studies would have been the consolation of my old age , and thought , after having lost all the other joys and blessings of childhood and of youth , I had secured one , of which no power , no unhappiness could rob me . But I was scarcely twenty years old , when that weakness of nerves and of stomach , which has destroyed my life , and yet gives me no hope of death , robbed that only blessing of more than half its value , and , in my twenty-eighth year , has utterly deprived me of it , and , as I must think , forever . I have not been able to read these pages , and have been compelled to entrust their revision to other eyes and other hands . I will utter no more complaints , my dear friends ; the consciousness of the depth of my affliction admits not of complaints and lamentations . I have lost all ; I am a withered branch , that feels and suffers still . You only have I won ! Your society , which must compensate me for all my studies , joys , and hopes , would almost outweigh my sorrows , did not my very sickness prevent me from enjoying it as I could wish , and did I not know that Fate will soon deprive me of this benefit , also , and will compel me to spend the remainder of my days , far from all the delights of civilized life , in a spot , far better suited to the dead than to the living . Your love , meanwhile , will ever follow me , and will yet cling to me , perhaps , when this body , which , indeed , no longer lives , shall be turned to ashes . Farewell ! Your</p>
   <p>Leopardi .</p>

    <head>TO ITALY . ( 1818 . )</head>
     <l n="1">My country , I the walls , the arches see ,</l>
     <l n="2">The columns , statues , and the towers</l>
     <l n="3">Deserted , of our ancestors ;</l>
     <l n="4">But , ah , the glory I do not behold ,</l>
     <l n="5">The laurel and the sword , that graced</l>
     <l n="6">Our sires of old .</l>
     <l n="7">Now , all unarmed , a naked brow ,</l>
     <l n="8">A naked breast dost thou display .</l>
     <l n="9">Ah , me , how many wounds , what stains of blood !</l>
     <l n="10">Oh , what a sight art thou ,</l>
     <l n="11">Most beautiful of women ! I</l>
     <l n="12">To heaven cry aloud , and to the world :</l>
     <l n="13">“ Who hath reduced her to this pass ?</l>
     <l n="14">Say , say ! ” And worst of all , alas ,</l>
     <l n="15">See , both her arms in chains are bound !</l>
     <l n="16">With hair dishevelled , and without a veil</l>
     <l n="17">She sits , disconsolate , upon the ground ,</l>
     <l n="18">And hides her face between her knees ,</l>
     <l n="19">As she bewails her miseries .</l>
     <l n="20">Oh , weep , my Italy , for thou hast cause ;</l>
     <l n="21">Thou , who wast born the nations to subdue ,</l>
     <l n="22">As victor , and as victim , too !</l>
     <l n="23">Oh , if thy eyes two living fountains were ,</l>
     <l n="24">The volume of their tears could ne'er express</l>
     <l n="25">Thy utter helplessness , thy shame ;</l>
     <l n="26">Thou , who wast once the haughty dame ,</l>
     <l n="27">And , now , the wretched slave .</l>
     <l n="28">Who speaks , or writes of thee ,</l>
     <l n="29">That must not bitterly exclaim :</l>
     <l n="30">“ She once was great , but , oh , behold her now ” ?</l>
     <l n="31">Why hast thou fallen thus , oh , why ?</l>
     <l n="32">Where is the ancient force ?</l>
     <l n="33">Where are the arms , the valor , constancy ?</l>
     <l n="34">Who hath deprived thee of thy sword ?</l>
     <l n="35">What treachery , what skill , what labor vast ,</l>
     <l n="36">Or what o'erwhelming horde</l>
     <l n="37">Whose fierce , invading tide , thou could'st not stem ,</l>
     <l n="38">Hath robbed thee of thy robe and diadem ?</l>
     <l n="39">From such a height how couldst thou fall so low ?</l>
     <l n="40">Will none defend thee ? No ?</l>
     <l n="41">No son of thine ? For arms , for arms , I call ;</l>
     <l n="42">Alone I 'll fight for thee , alone will fall .</l>
     <l n="43">And from my blood , a votive offering ,</l>
     <l n="44">May flames of fire in every bosom spring !</l>
     <l n="45">Where are thy sons ? The sound of arms I hear ,</l>
     <l n="46">Of chariots , of voices , and of drums ;</l>
     <l n="47">From foreign lands it comes ,</l>
     <l n="48">For which thy children fight .</l>
     <l n="49">Oh , hearken , hearken , Italy ! I see ,—</l>
     <l n="50">Or is it but a dream ?—</l>
     <l n="51">A wavering of horse and foot ,</l>
     <l n="52">And smoke , and dust , and flashing swords ,</l>
     <l n="53">That like the lightning gleam .</l>
     <l n="54">Art thou not comforted ? Dost turn away</l>
     <l n="55">Thy eyes , in horror , from the doubtful fray ?</l>
     <l n="56">Ye gods , ye gods . Oh , can it be ?</l>
     <l n="57">The youth of Italy</l>
     <l n="58">Their hireling swords for other lands have bared !</l>
     <l n="59">Oh , wretched he in war who falls ,</l>
     <l n="60">Not for his native shores ,</l>
     <l n="61">His loving wife and children dear ,</l>
     <l n="62">But , fighting for another 's gain ,</l>
     <l n="63">And by another 's foe is slain !</l>
     <l n="64">Nor can he say , as his last breath he draws ,</l>
     <l n="65">“ My mother-land , beloved , ah see ,</l>
     <l n="66">The life thou gav'st , I render back to thee ! ”</l>
     <l n="67">Oh fortunate and dear and blessed ,</l>
     <l n="68">The ancient days , when rushed to death the brave ,</l>
     <l n="69">In crowds , their country 's life to save !</l>
     <l n="70">And you , forever glorious ,</l>
     <l n="71">Thessalian straits ,</l>
     <l n="72">Where Persia , Fate itself , could not withstand</l>
     <l n="73">The fiery zeal of that devoted band !</l>
     <l n="74">Do not the trees , the rocks , the waves ,</l>
     <l n="75">The mountains , to each passer-by ,</l>
     <l n="76">With low and plaintive voice tell</l>
     <l n="77">The wondrous tale of those who fell ,</l>
     <l n="78">Heroes invincible who gave</l>
     <l n="79">Their lives , their Greece to save ?</l>
     <l n="80">Then cowardly as fierce ,</l>
     <l n="81">Xerxes across the Hellespont retired ,</l>
     <l n="82">A laughing-stock to all succeeding time ;</l>
     <l n="83">And up Anthela 's hill , where , e'en in death</l>
     <l n="84">The sacred Band immortal life obtained ,</l>
     <l n="85">Simonides slow-climbing , thoughtfully ,</l>
     <l n="86">Looked forth on sea and shore and sky .</l>
     <l n="87">And then , his cheeks with tears bedewed ,</l>
     <l n="88">And heaving breast , and trembling foot , he stood ,</l>
     <l n="89">His lyre in hand and sang :</l>
     <l n="90">“ O ye , forever blessed ,</l>
     <l n="91">Who bared your breasts unto the foeman 's lance ,</l>
     <l n="92">For love of her , who gave you birth ;</l>
     <l n="93">By Greece revered , and by the world admired ,</l>
     <l n="94">What ardent love your youthful minds inspired ,</l>
     <l n="95">To rush to arms , such perils dire to meet ,</l>
     <l n="96">A fate so hard , with loving smiles to greet ?</l>
     <l n="97">Her children , why so joyously ,</l>
     <l n="98">Ran ye , that stern and rugged pass to guard ?</l>
     <l n="99">As if unto a dance ,</l>
     <l n="100">Or to some splendid feast ,</l>
     <l n="101">Each one appeared to haste ,</l>
     <l n="102">And not grim death Death to brave ;</l>
     <l n="103">But Tartarus awaited ye ,</l>
     <l n="104">And the cold Stygian wave ;</l>
     <l n="105">Nor were your wives or children at your side ,</l>
     <l n="106">When , on that rugged shore ,</l>
     <l n="107">Without a kiss , without a tear , ye died .</l>
     <l n="108">But not without a fearful blow</l>
     <l n="109">To Persians dealt , and their undying shame .</l>
     <l n="110">As at a herd of bulls a lion glares ,</l>
     <l n="111">Then , plunging in , upon the back</l>
     <l n="112">Of this one leaps , and with his claws</l>
     <l n="113">A passage all along his chine he tears ,</l>
     <l n="114">And fiercely drives his teeth into his sides ,</l>
     <l n="115">Such havoc Grecian wrath and valor made</l>
     <l n="116">Amongst the Persian ranks , dismayed .</l>
     <l n="117">Behold each prostrate rider and his steed ;</l>
     <l n="118">Behold the chariots , and the fallen tents ,</l>
     <l n="119">A tangled mass their flight impede ;</l>
     <l n="120">And see , among the first to fly ,</l>
     <l n="121">The tyrant , pale , and in disorder wild !</l>
     <l n="122">See , how the Grecian youths ,</l>
     <l n="123">With blood barbaric dyed ,</l>
     <l n="124">And dealing death on every side ,</l>
     <l n="125">By slow degrees by their own wounds subdued ,</l>
     <l n="126">The one upon the other fall . Farewell ,</l>
     <l n="127">Ye heroes blessed , whose names shall live ,</l>
     <l n="128">While tongue can speak , or pen your story tell !</l>
     <l n="129">Sooner the stars , torn from their spheres , shall hiss ,</l>
     <l n="130">Extinguished in the bottom of the sea ,</l>
     <l n="131">Than the dear memory , and love of you ,</l>
     <l n="132">Shall suffer loss , or injury .</l>
     <l n="133">Your tomb an altar is ; the mothers here</l>
     <l n="134">Shall come , unto their little ones to show</l>
     <l n="135">The lovely traces of your blood . Behold ,</l>
     <l n="136">Ye blessed , myself upon the ground I throw ,</l>
     <l n="137">And kiss these stones , these clods</l>
     <l n="138">Whose fame , unto the end of time ,</l>
     <l n="139">Shall sacred be in every clime .</l>
     <l n="140">Oh , had I , too , been here with you ,</l>
     <l n="141">And this dear earth had moistened with my blood !</l>
     <l n="142">But since stern Fate would not consent</l>
     <l n="143">That I for Greece my dying eyes should close ,</l>
     <l n="144">In conflict with her foes ,</l>
     <l n="145">Still may the gracious gods accept</l>
     <l n="146">The offering I bring ,</l>
     <l n="147">And grant to me the precious boon ,</l>
     <l n="148">Your Hymn of Praise to sing ! ”</l>

     <l n="21">Art thou the same ? What preys upon thee thus ? ”</l>
     <l n="22">“ Oblivion weighs upon thy thoughts , and sleep</l>
     <l n="23">Envelops them , ” she answered ; “ I am dead ,</l>
     <l n="24">And many months have passed , since last we met . ”</l>
     <l n="25">What grief oppressed me , as these words I heard !</l>
     <l n="26">And she continued : “ In the flower of youth</l>
     <l n="27">Cut off , when life is sweetest , and before</l>
     <l n="28">The heart that lesson sad and sure hath learnt ,</l>
     <l n="29">The utter vanity of human hope !</l>
     <l n="30">The sick man may e'en covet , as a boon ,</l>
     <l n="31">That which withdraws him from all suffering ;</l>
     <l n="32">But to the young , Death comes , disconsolate ;</l>
     <l n="33">And hard the fate of hope , that in the grave</l>
     <l n="34">Is quenched ! And yet , how vain that knowledge is ,</l>
     <l n="35">That Nature from the inexperienced hides !</l>
     <l n="36">And a blind sorrow is to be preferred</l>
     <l n="37">To wisdom premature ! ” — “ Hush , hush ! ” I cried ,</l>
     <l n="38">“ Unhappy one , and dear ! My heart is crushed</l>
     <l n="39">With these thy words ! And art thou dead , indeed ,</l>
     <l n="40">O my beloved ? and am I still alive ?</l>
     <l n="41">And was it , then , in heaven decreed , that this ,</l>
     <l n="42">Thy tender body the last damps of death</l>
     <l n="43">Should feel , and my poor , wretched frame remain</l>
     <l n="44">Unharmed ? Oh , often , often as I think</l>
     <l n="45">That thou no longer livest , and that I</l>
     <l n="46">Shall never see thee on the earth again ,</l>
     <l n="47">Incredible it seems ! Alas , alas !</l>
     <l n="48">What is this thing , that they call death ? Oh , would</l>
     <l n="49">That I , this day , the mystery could solve ,</l>
     <l n="50">And my defenceless head withdraw from Fate 's</l>
     <l n="51">Relentless hate ! I still am young , and still</l>
     <l n="52">Feel all the blight and misery of age ,</l>
     <l n="53">Which I so dread ; and distant far it seems ;</l>
     <l n="54">But , ah , how little different from age ,</l>
     <l n="55">The flower of my years ! ” — “ We both were born , ”</l>
     <l n="56">She said , “ to weep ; unhappy were our lives ,</l>
     <l n="57">And heaven took pleasure in our sufferings . ”</l>
     <l n="58">“ Oh if my eyes with tears , ” I added , “ then ,</l>
     <l n="59">My face with pallor veiled thou seest , for loss</l>
     <l n="60">Of thee , and anguish weighing on my heart ;</l>
     <l n="61">Tell me , was any spark of pity or of love</l>
     <l n="62">For the poor lover kindled in thy heart ,</l>
     <l n="63">While thou didst live ? I , then , between my hope</l>
     <l n="64">And my despair , passed weary nights and days ;</l>
     <l n="65">And now , my mind is with vain doubts oppressed .</l>
     <l n="66">Oh if but once compassion smote thee for</l>
     <l n="67">My darkened life , conceal it not from me ,</l>
     <l n="68">I pray thee ; let the memory console me ,</l>
     <l n="69">Since of their future our young days were robbed ! ”</l>
     <l n="70">And she : “ Be comforted , unhappy one !</l>
     <l n="71">I was not churlish of my pity whilst</l>
     <l n="72">I lived , and am not now , myself so wretched !</l>
     <l n="73">Oh , do not chide this most unhappy child ! ”</l>
     <l n="74">“ By all our sufferings , and by the love</l>
     <l n="75">Which preys upon me , ” I exclaimed , “ and by</l>
     <l n="76">Our youth , and by the hope that faded from</l>
     <l n="77">Our lives , O let me , dearest , touch thy hand ! ”</l>
     <l n="78">And sweetly , sadly , she extended it .</l>
     <l n="79">And while I covered it with kisses , while</l>
     <l n="80">With sorrow and with rapture quivering ,</l>
     <l n="81">I to my panting bosom fondly pressed it ,</l>
     <l n="82">With fervent passion glowed my face and breast ,</l>
     <l n="83">My trembling voice refused its utterance ,</l>
     <l n="84">And all things swam before my sight ; when she ,</l>
     <l n="85">Her eyes fixed tenderly on mine , replied :</l>
     <l n="86">“ And dost thou , then , forget , dear friend , that I</l>
     <l n="87">Am of my beauty utterly deprived ?</l>
     <l n="88">And vainly thou , unhappy one , dost yield</l>
     <l n="89">To passion 's transports . Now , a last farewell !</l>
     <l n="90">Our wretched minds , our feeble bodies , too ,</l>
     <l n="91">Eternally are parted . Thou to me</l>
     <l n="92">No longer livest , nevermore shall live .</l>
     <l n="93">Fate hath annulled the faith that thou hast sworn . ”</l>
     <l n="94">Then , in my anguish as I seemed to cry</l>
     <l n="95">Aloud , convulsed , my eyes o'erflowing with</l>
     <l n="96">The tears of utter , helpless misery ,</l>
     <l n="97">I started from my sleep . The image still</l>
     <l n="98">Was seen , and in the sun 's uncertain light</l>
     <l n="99">Above my couch she seemed to linger still .</l>

    <head>THE LONELY LIFE .</head>

     <l n="1">The morning rain , when , from her coop released ,</l>
     <l n="2">The hen , exulting , flaps her wings , when from</l>
     <l n="3">The balcony the husbandman looks forth ,</l>
     <l n="4">And when the rising sun his trembling rays</l>
     <l n="5">Darts through the falling drops , against my roof</l>
     <l n="6">And windows gently beating , wakens me .</l>
     <l n="7">I rise , and grateful , bless the flying clouds ,</l>
     <l n="8">The cheerful twitter of the early birds ,</l>
     <l n="9">The smiling fields , and the refreshing air .</l>
     <l n="10">For I of you , unhappy city walls ,</l>
     <l n="11">Enough have seen and known ; where hatred still</l>
     <l n="12">Companion is to grief ; and grieving still</l>
     <l n="13">I live , and so shall die , and that , how soon !</l>
     <l n="14">But here some pity Nature shows , though small ,</l>
     <l n="15">Once in this spot to me so courteous !</l>

     <l n="20">No friend in heaven , on earth , the wretched hath ,</l>
     <l n="21">No refuge , save his trusty dagger 's edge .</l>
     <l n="22">Sometimes I sit in perfect solitude ,</l>
     <l n="23">Upon a hill , that overlooks a lake ,</l>
     <l n="24">That is encircled quite with silent trees .</l>
     <l n="25">There , when the sun his mid-day course hath reached ,</l>
     <l n="26">His tranquil face he in a mirror sees :</l>
     <l n="27">Nor grass nor leaf is shaken by the wind ;</l>
     <l n="28">There is no ripple on the wave , no chirp</l>
     <l n="29">Of cricket , rustling wing of bird in bush ,</l>
     <l n="30">Nor hum of butterfly ; no motion , voice ,</l>
     <l n="31">Or far or near , is either seen or heard .</l>
     <l n="32">Its shores are locked in quiet most profound ;</l>
     <l n="33">So that myself , the world I quite forget ,</l>
     <l n="34">As motionless I sit ; my limbs appear</l>
     <l n="35">To lie dissolved , of breath and sense deprived ;</l>
     <l n="36">As if , in immemorial rest , they seemed</l>
     <l n="37">Confounded with the silent scene around .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="38">O love , O love , long since , thou from this breast</l>

     <l n="40">Misfortune in her cold and cruel grasp</l>
     <l n="41">Has held it fast , and it to ice has turned ,</l>
     <l n="42">E'en in the flower of my youth . The time</l>
     <l n="43">I well recall , when thou this heart didst fill ;</l>

     <l n="45">When this unhappy scene of life unto</l>
     <l n="46">The ardent gaze of youth reveals itself ,</l>
     <l n="47">Expands , and wears the smile of Paradise .</l>
     <l n="48">How throbs the heart within the boyish breast ,</l>
     <l n="49">By virgin hope and fond desire impelled !</l>
     <l n="50">The wretched dupe for life 's hard work prepares ,</l>
     <l n="51">As if it were a dance , or merry game .</l>
     <l n="52">But when I first , O love , thy presence felt ,</l>
     <l n="53">Misfortune had already crushed my life ,</l>

     <l n="58">I of some lonely maiden meet the gaze ;</l>
     <l n="59">Or when , in silence of the summer night ,</l>

     <l n="62">Upon the lonely scene , and hear the voice ,</l>
     <l n="63">So clear and cheerful , of the maiden , who ,</l>
     <l n="64">Her ditty chanting , in her quiet room ,</l>
     <l n="65">Her daily task protracts into the night ,</l>
     <l n="66">Ah , then this stony heart will throb once more ;</l>
     <l n="67">But soon , alas , its lethargy returns ,</l>
     <l n="68">For all things sweet are strangers to this breast !</l>

     <l n="69">Belovèd moon , beneath whose tranquil rays</l>

     <l n="72">Confused and intricate , that from their forms</l>

     <l n="74">Of Night ! How unpropitious fall thy rays ,</l>
     <l n="75">Among the cliffs and thickets , or within</l>
     <l n="76">Deserted buildings , on the gleaming steel</l>
     <l n="77">Of robber pale , who with attentive ear</l>
     <l n="78">Unto the distant noise of horses and</l>
     <l n="79">Of wheels , is listening , or the tramp of feet</l>
     <l n="80">Upon the silent road ; then , suddenly ,</l>

     <l n="83">Whom he half-dead , and naked , shortly leaves</l>
     <l n="84">Among the rocks . How unpropitious , too ,</l>

     <l n="86">Unto the worthless paramour , who picks</l>
     <l n="87">His way , close to the walls , in anxious search</l>
     <l n="88">Of friendly shade , and halts , and dreads the sight</l>
     <l n="89">Of blazing lamps , and open balconies .</l>
     <l n="90">To evil spirits unpropitious still ,</l>
     <l n="91">To me thy face will ever seem benign ,</l>

     <l n="94">And yet it was my wayward custom once ,</l>
     <l n="95">Though I was innocent , thy gracious ray</l>
     <l n="96">To chide , amid the haunts of men , whene'er</l>
     <l n="97">It would my face to them betray , and when</l>
     <l n="98">It would their faces unto me reveal .</l>
     <l n="99">Now will I , grateful , sing its constant praise ,</l>
     <l n="100">When I behold thee , sailing through the clouds ,</l>
     <l n="101">Or when , mild sovereign of the realms of air ,</l>
     <l n="102">Thou lookest down on this , our vale of tears .</l>
     <l n="103">Me wilt thou oft behold , mute wanderer</l>
     <l n="104">Among the groves , along the verdant banks ,</l>
     <l n="105">Or seated on the grass , content enough ,</l>
     <l n="106">If heart and breath are left me , for a sigh !</l>

    <head>CONSALVO .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Approaching now the end of his abode</l>
     <l n="2">On earth , Consalvo lay ; complaining once ,</l>
     <l n="3">Of his hard fate , but now quite reconciled ,</l>
     <l n="4">When , in the midst of his fifth lustre , o'er</l>
     <l n="5">His head oblivion , so longed-for , hung .</l>
     <l n="6">As for some time , so , on his dying day ,</l>
     <l n="7">He lay , abandoned by his dearest friends :</l>
     <l n="8">For in the world , few friends to him will cling ,</l>
     <l n="9">Who shows that he is weary of the world .</l>
     <l n="10">Yet she was at his side , by pity led ,</l>
     <l n="11">In his lone wretchedness to comfort him ,</l>
     <l n="12">Who was alone and ever in his thought ;</l>
     <l n="13">Elvira , for her loveliness renowned ;</l>
     <l n="14">And knowing well her power ; that a look ,</l>
     <l n="15">A single sweet and gracious word from her ,</l>
     <l n="16">A thousand-fold repeated in the heart ,</l>
     <l n="17">Devoted , of her hapless lover , still</l>
     <l n="18">His consolation and support had been ,</l>
     <l n="19">Although no word of love had she from him</l>
     <l n="20">E'er heard . For ever in his soul the power</l>
     <l n="21">Of great desire had been rebuked and crushed</l>
     <l n="22">By sovereign fear . So great a child and slave</l>
     <l n="23">Had he become , through his excess of love !</l>
     <l n="24">But death at last the cruel silence broke ;</l>
     <l n="25">For being by sure signs convinced , that now</l>
     <l n="26">The day of his deliverance had come ,</l>
     <l n="27">Her white hand taking , as she was about</l>
     <l n="28">To leave , and gently pressing it , he said :</l>
     <l n="29">“ Thou goest ; it is time for thee to go ;</l>
     <l n="30">Farewell , Elvira ! I shall never see</l>
     <l n="31">Thee more ; too well I know it ; so , farewell !</l>
     <l n="32">I thank thee for thy gentle sympathy ,</l>
     <l n="33">So far as my poor lips my thanks can speak .</l>
     <l n="34">He will reward thee , who alone has power ,</l>
     <l n="35">If heaven e'er rewards the merciful . ”</l>
     <l n="36">Pale turned the fair one at these words ; a sigh</l>
     <l n="37">Her bosom heaved ; for e'en a stranger 's heart</l>
     <l n="38">A throb responsive feels , when she departs ,</l>
     <l n="39">And says farewell forever . Fain would she</l>
     <l n="40">Have contradicted him , the near approach</l>
     <l n="41">Of fate concealing from the dying man .</l>
     <l n="42">But he , her thought anticipating , said :</l>
     <l n="43">“ Ah , much desired , as well thou knowest , death ,</l>
     <l n="44">Much prayed for , and not dreaded , comes to me ;</l>
     <l n="45">Nay , joyful seems to me this fatal day ,</l>
     <l n="46">Save for the thought of losing thee forever ;</l>
     <l n="47">Alas , forever do I part from thee !</l>
     <l n="48">In saying this my heart is rent in twain .</l>
     <l n="49">Those eyes I shall no more behold , nor hear</l>
     <l n="50">Thy voice . But , O Elvira , say , before</l>
     <l n="51">Thou leavest me forever , wilt thou not</l>
     <l n="52">One kiss bestow ? A single kiss , in all</l>
     <l n="53">My life ? A favor asked , who can deny</l>
     <l n="54">Unto a dying man ? Of the sweet gift</l>
     <l n="55">I ne'er can boast , so near my end , whose lips</l>
     <l n="56">To-day will by a stranger 's hand be closed</l>
     <l n="57">Forever . ” Saying this , with a deep sigh ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="59">The lovely woman stood irresolute ,</l>

     <l n="65">His wish , and by refusal , make more sad</l>
     <l n="66">The sad farewell ; but she compassion took</l>

     <l n="68">And that celestial face , that mouth , which he</l>

     <l n="72">Discolored by his mortal agony ,</l>
     <l n="73">Kiss after kiss , all goodness , with a look</l>

     <l n="79">The hand , which still he held , of his beloved</l>
     <l n="80">Elvira , placing on his heart , whose last</l>
     <l n="81">Pulsations love with death was sharing , said :</l>

     <l n="90">Too manifest it was to thee , in looks ,</l>

     <l n="104">Responded to my long-enduring love ,</l>
     <l n="105">To my changed eyes this earth for evermore</l>
     <l n="106">Had been transformed into a Paradise .</l>
     <l n="107">E'en to old age , detestable old age ,</l>
     <l n="108">Could I have been resigned and reconciled .</l>
     <l n="109">To bear its heavy load , the memory</l>
     <l n="110">Of one transcendent moment had sufficed ,</l>
     <l n="111">When I was happier than the happiest ,</l>
     <l n="112">But , ah , such bliss supreme the envious gods</l>
     <l n="113">To earthly natures ne'er have given ! Love</l>
     <l n="114">In such excess ne'er leads to happiness .</l>
     <l n="115">And yet , thy love to win , I would have borne</l>
     <l n="116">The tortures of the executioner ;</l>
     <l n="117">Have faced the rack and fagot , dauntlessly ;</l>

     <l n="1">This wearisome and this distressing sleep</l>
     <l n="2">That we call life , O how dost thou support ,</l>
     <l n="3">My Pepoli ? With what hopes feedest thou</l>
     <l n="4">Thy heart ? Say in what thoughts , and in what deeds ,</l>
     <l n="5">Agreeable or sad , dost thou invest</l>
     <l n="6">The idleness thy ancestors bequeathed</l>
     <l n="7">To thee , a dull and heavy heritage ?</l>
     <l n="8">All life , indeed , in every walk of life ,</l>
     <l n="9">Is idleness , if we may give that name</l>
     <l n="10">To every work achieved , or effort made ,</l>
     <l n="11">That has no worthy aim in view , or fails</l>
     <l n="12">That aim to reach . And if you idle call</l>
     <l n="13">The busy crew , that daily we behold ,</l>
     <l n="14">From tranquil morn unto the dewy eve ,</l>
     <l n="15">Behind the plough , or tending plants and flocks ,</l>
     <l n="16">Because they live simply to keep alive ,</l>
     <l n="17">And life is worthless for itself alone ,</l>
     <l n="18">The honest truth you speak . His nights and days</l>
     <l n="19">The pilot spends in idleness ; the toil</l>
     <l n="20">And sweat in workshops are but idleness ;</l>
     <l n="21">The soldier 's vigils , perils of the field ,</l>
     <l n="22">The eager merchant 's cares are idle all ;</l>
     <l n="23">Because true happiness , for which alone</l>
     <l n="24">Our mortal nature longs and strives , no man ,</l>
     <l n="25">Or for himself , or others , e'er acquires</l>
     <l n="26">Through toil or sweat , through peril , or through care .</l>
     <l n="27">Yet for this fierce desire , which mortals still</l>
     <l n="28">From the beginning of the world have felt ,</l>
     <l n="29">But ever felt in vain , for happiness ,</l>
     <l n="30">By way of soothing remedy devised ,</l>
     <l n="31">Nature , in this unhappy life of ours ,</l>
     <l n="32">Had manifold necessities prepared ,</l>
     <l n="33">Not without thought or labor satisfied ;</l>
     <l n="34">So that the days , though ever sad , less dull</l>
     <l n="35">Might seem unto the human family ;</l>
     <l n="36">And this desire , bewildered and confused ,</l>
     <l n="37">Might have less power to agitate the heart .</l>
     <l n="38">So , too , the various families of brutes ,</l>
     <l n="39">Who have , no less than we , and vainly , too ,</l>

     <l n="41">On that which is essential to their life ,</l>
     <l n="42">Consume their days more pleasantly , by far ,</l>
     <l n="43">Nor chide , with us , the dulness of the hours .</l>
     <l n="44">But we , who unto other hands commit</l>
     <l n="45">The furnishing of our immediate wants ,</l>
     <l n="46">Have a necessity more grave to meet ,</l>
     <l n="47">For which no other ever can provide ,</l>
     <l n="48">With ennui laden , and with suffering ;</l>
     <l n="49">The stern necessity of killing time ;</l>

     <l n="52">Nor fertile fields , nor sumptuous palaces ,</l>

     <l n="119">First entrance into manhood , O ye days</l>
     <l n="120">Bewitching , inexpressible , when first</l>
     <l n="121">On the enchanted mortal smiles the maid ,</l>
     <l n="122">And all things round in emulation smile ;</l>
     <l n="123">And envy holds its peace , not yet awake ,</l>

     <l n="125">— O marvel rare !— the world a helping hand</l>
     <l n="126">To him extends , his faults excuses , greets</l>
     <l n="127">His entrance into life , with bows and smiles</l>
     <l n="128">Acknowledges his claims to its respect ?</l>
     <l n="129">O fleeting days ! How like the lightning 's flash ,</l>

     <l n="142">Where art thou , that I can no longer hear</l>

     <l n="149">And others dwell amid these fragrant hills .</l>
     <l n="150">How quickly thou hast passed ! Thy life was like</l>

     <l n="152">Resplendent shone , anticipations bright</l>
     <l n="153">Shone in thy eyes , the light of youth , when Fate</l>
     <l n="154">Extinguished them , and thou didst prostrate lie .</l>
     <l n="155">Nerina , in my heart the old love reigns .</l>
     <l n="156">If I at times still go unto some feast ,</l>
     <l n="157">Or social gathering , unto myself</l>
     <l n="158">I say : “ Nerina , thou no more to feast</l>
     <l n="159">Dost go , nor for the ball thyself adorn . ”</l>
     <l n="160">If May returns , when lovers offerings</l>
     <l n="161">Of flowers and of songs to maidens bring ,</l>
     <l n="162">I say : “ Nerina mine , to thee spring ne'er</l>
     <l n="163">Returns , and love no more its tribute brings . ”</l>
     <l n="164">Each pleasant day , each flowery field that I</l>
     <l n="165">Behold , each pleasure that I taste , the thought</l>
     <l n="166">Suggest : “ Nerina pleasure knows no more ,</l>
     <l n="167">The face of heaven and earth no more beholds . ”</l>
     <l n="168">Ah , thou hast passed , for whom I ever sigh !</l>
     <l n="169">Hast passed ; and still the memory of thee</l>
     <l n="170">Remains , and with each thought and fancy blends</l>
     <l n="171">Each varying emotion of the heart ;</l>
     <l n="172">And will remain , so bitter , yet so sweet !</l>

     <l n="2">Say , silent moon , what doest thou ?</l>
     <l n="3">Thou risest in the evening ; thoughtfully</l>
     <l n="4">Thou wanderest o'er the plain ,</l>

     <l n="10">How much thy life is like</l>
     <l n="11">The shepherd 's life , forlorn !</l>
     <l n="12">He rises in the early dawn ,</l>
     <l n="13">He moves his flock along the plain ;</l>
     <l n="14">The selfsame flocks , and streams , and herbs</l>
     <l n="15">He sees again ;</l>
     <l n="16">Then drops to rest , the day 's work o'er ;</l>
     <l n="17">And hopes for nothing more .</l>
     <l n="18">Tell me , O moon , what signifies his life</l>
     <l n="19">To him , thy life to thee ? Say , whither tend</l>

     <l n="27">In wind , and storm , alike in sultry heat</l>
     <l n="28">And in the winter 's cold ,</l>
     <l n="29">His constant course doth hold ;</l>

     <l n="31">Nor pause , nor rest he knows ;</l>
     <l n="32">Through rushing torrents , over watery wastes ;</l>
     <l n="33">He falls , gets up again ,</l>
     <l n="34">And ever more and more he hastes ,</l>
     <l n="35">Torn , bleeding , and arrives at last</l>
     <l n="36">Where ends the path ,</l>
     <l n="37">Where all his troubles end ;</l>
     <l n="38">A vast abyss and horrible ,</l>

     <l n="40">Such scene of suffering , and of strife ,</l>
     <l n="41">O moon , is this our mortal life .</l>
     <l n="42">In travail man is born ;</l>
     <l n="43">His birth too oft the cause of death ,</l>
     <l n="44">And with his earliest breath</l>
     <l n="45">He pain and torment feels : e'en from the first ,</l>
     <l n="46">His parents fondly strive</l>
     <l n="47">To comfort him in his distress ;</l>
     <l n="48">And if he lives and grows ,</l>
     <l n="49">They struggle hard , as best they may ,</l>
     <l n="50">With pleasant words and deeds to cheer him up ,</l>
     <l n="51">And seek with kindly care ,</l>
     <l n="52">To strengthen him his cruel lot to bear .</l>
     <l n="53">This is the best that they can do</l>

     <l n="86">My flocks before me drive ;</l>
     <l n="87">And when I gaze upon the stars at night ,</l>
     <l n="88">In thought I ask myself ,</l>

     <l n="34">By beauty caused , and harmony , that seem</l>
     <l n="35">The mystery of Elysium to reveal .</l>
     <l n="36">The stricken mortal fondly worships , then ,</l>
     <l n="37">His own ideal , creature of his mind ,</l>
     <l n="38">Which of his heaven the greater part contains .</l>
     <l n="39">Alike in looks , in manners , and in speech ,</l>
     <l n="40">The real and ideal seem to him ,</l>
     <l n="41">In his confused and passion-guided soul .</l>
     <l n="42">But not the woman , but the dream it is ,</l>
     <l n="43">That in his fond caresses , he adores .</l>
     <l n="44">At last his error finding , and the sad exchange ,</l>
     <l n="45">He is enraged , and most unjustly , oft ,</l>
     <l n="46">The woman chides . For rarely does the mind</l>
     <l n="47">Of woman to that high ideal rise ;</l>
     <l n="48">And that which her own beauty oft inspires</l>
     <l n="49">In generous lovers , she imagines not ,</l>
     <l n="50">Nor could she comprehend . Those narrow brows ,</l>
     <l n="51">Cannot such great conceptions hold . The man ,</l>
     <l n="52">Deceived , builds false hopes on those lustrous eyes ,</l>
     <l n="53">And feelings deep , ineffable , nay , more</l>
     <l n="54">Than manly , vainly seeks in her , who is</l>
     <l n="55">By nature so inferior to man .</l>
     <l n="56">For as her limbs more soft and slender are ,</l>
     <l n="57">So is her mind less capable and strong .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="58">Nor hast thou ever known , Aspasia ,</l>

     <l n="63">Thou didst arouse in me ; nor will the time</l>
     <l n="64">E'er come when thou could'st understand them . So ,</l>
     <l n="65">Musicians , too , are often ignorant</l>
     <l n="66">Of the effects they with the hand and voice</l>
     <l n="67">Produce on him that listens . Dead is that</l>

     <l n="79">With her celestial beauty , that , although</l>

     <l n="84">Deceived ? Ah , no ! But by the pleasure led ,</l>
     <l n="85">Of that sweet likeness , that allured me so ,</l>
     <l n="86">A long and heavy servitude to bear .</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="105">My judgment , freedom to resume . For though</l>
     <l n="106">A life bereft of love 's illusions sweet ,</l>
     <l n="107">Is like a starless night , in winter 's midst ,</l>
     <l n="108">Yet some revenge , some comfort can I find</l>
     <l n="109">For my hard fate , that here upon the grass ,</l>
     <l n="110">Outstretched in indolence I lie , and gaze</l>
     <l n="111">Upon the earth and sea and sky , and smile .</l>

     <l n="6">The mysteries of the craft to see .</l>
     <l n="7">She guided me</l>
     <l n="8">Through every part ,</l>
     <l n="9">And showed me all</l>
     <l n="10">The instruments of art ,</l>
     <l n="11">And did their uses all rehearse ,</l>
     <l n="12">In works alike of prose and verse .</l>
     <l n="13">I looked , and paused awhile ,</l>
     <l n="14">Then asked : “ O Muse , where is the file ? ”</l>
     <l n="15">“ The file is out of order , friend , and we</l>
     <l n="16">Now do without it , ” answered she .</l>
     <l n="17">“ But , to repair it , then , have you no care ? ”</l>
     <l n="18">“ We should , indeed , but have no time to spare . ”</l>

      <l n="1">I round the threshold wandering here ,</l>
      <l n="2">Vainly the tempest and the rain invoke ,</l>
      <l n="3">That they may keep my lady prisoner .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="2">
      <l n="4">And yet the wind was howling in the woods ,</l>
      <l n="5">The roving thunder bellowing in the clouds ,</l>
      <l n="6">Before the dawn had risen in the sky .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="3">
      <l n="7">O ye dear clouds ! O heaven ! O earth ! O trees !</l>
      <l n="8">My lady goes ! Have mercy , if on earth</l>
      <l n="9">Unhappy lovers ever mercy find !</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="4">
      <l n="10">Awake , ye whirlwinds ! storm-charged clouds , awake ,</l>
      <l n="11">O'erwhelm me with your floods , until the sun</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="5">
      <l n="13">Heaven opens ; the wind falls ; the grass , the leaves</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="6">
      <l n="16">The light of day was fading in the west ,</l>
      <l n="17">The smoke no more from village chimneys curled ,</l>
      <l n="18">Nor voice of man , nor bark of dog was heard ;</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="7">
      <l n="19">When she , obedient to Love 's rendezvous ,</l>
      <l n="20">Had reached the middle of a plain , than which</l>
      <l n="21">No other more bewitching could be found .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="8">
      <l n="22">The moon on every side her lustre shed ,</l>
      <l n="23">And all in robes of silver light arrayed</l>
      <l n="24">The trees with which the place was garlanded .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="9">
      <l n="25">The rustling boughs were murmuring to the wind ,</l>
      <l n="26">And , blending with the plaintive nightingale ,</l>
      <l n="27">A rivulet poured forth its sweet lament .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="10">
      <l n="28">The sea shone in the distance , and the fields</l>
      <l n="29">And groves ; and slowly rising , one by one ,</l>
      <l n="30">The summits of the mountains were revealed .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="11">
      <l n="31">In quiet shade the sombre valley lay ,</l>
      <l n="32">While all the little hills around were clothed</l>
      <l n="33">With the soft lustre of the dewy moon .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="12">
      <l n="34">The maiden kept the silent , lonely path ,</l>
      <l n="35">And gently passing o'er her face , she felt</l>
      <l n="36">The motion of the perfume-laden breeze .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="13">
      <l n="37">If she were happy , it were vain to ask ;</l>
      <l n="38">The scene delighted her , and the delight</l>
      <l n="39">Her heart was promising , was greater still .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="14">
      <l n="40">How swift your flight , O lovely hours serene !</l>
      <l n="41">No other pleasure here below endures ,</l>
      <l n="42">Or lingers with us long , save hope alone .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="15">
      <l n="43">The night began to change , and dark became</l>
      <l n="44">The face of heaven , that was so beautiful ,</l>
      <l n="45">And all her pleasure now was turned to fear .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="16">
      <l n="46">An angry cloud , precursor of the storm ,</l>
      <l n="47">Behind the mountains rose , and still increased ,</l>
      <l n="48">Till moon or star no longer could be seen .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="17">
      <l n="49">She saw it spreading upon every side ,</l>
      <l n="50">And by degrees ascending through the air ,</l>
      <l n="51">And now with its black mantle covering all .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="18">
      <l n="52">The scanty light more faint and faint became ;</l>
      <l n="53">The wind , meanwhile , was rising in the grove ,</l>
      <l n="54">That on the farther side the spot enclosed ;</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="19">
      <l n="55">And , every moment , was more boisterous ;</l>
      <l n="56">Till every bird , awaking in its fright ,</l>
      <l n="57">Amidst the trembling leaves was fluttering .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="20">
      <l n="58">The cloud , increasing still , unto the coast</l>
      <l n="59">Descended , so that one extremity</l>
      <l n="60">The mountains touched , the other touched the sea .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="21">
      <l n="61">And now from out its black and hollow womb ,</l>
      <l n="62">The pattering rain-drops , falling fast , were heard ,</l>
      <l n="63">The sound increasing as the cloud drew near .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="22">
      <l n="64">And round her now the glancing lightning flashed</l>
      <l n="65">In fearful mood , and made her shut her eyes ;</l>
      <l n="66">The ground was black , the air a mass of flame .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="23">
      <l n="67">Her trembling knees could scarce her weight sustain ;</l>
      <l n="68">The thunder roared with a continuous sound ,</l>
      <l n="69">Like torrent , plunging headlong from the cliff .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="24">
      <l n="70">At times she paused , the dismal scene to view ,</l>
      <l n="71">In blank dismay ; then on she ran again ,</l>
      <l n="72">Her hair and clothes all streaming in the wind .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="25">
      <l n="73">The cruel wind beat hard against her breast ,</l>
      <l n="74">And rushing fiercely , with its angry breath ,</l>
      <l n="75">The cold drops dashed , remorseless , in her face .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="26">
      <l n="76">The thunder , like a beast , assaulted her ,</l>
      <l n="77">With terrible , unintermitting roar ;</l>
      <l n="78">And more and more the rain and tempest raged .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="27">
      <l n="79">And from all sides in wild confusion flew</l>
      <l n="80">The dust and leaves , the branches and the stones ,</l>
      <l n="81">With hideous tumult , inconceivable .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="28">
      <l n="82">Her weary , blinded eyes now covering ,</l>
      <l n="83">And folding close her clothes against her breast ,</l>
      <l n="84">She through the storm her fearful path pursued .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="29">
      <l n="85">But now the lightning glared so in her face ,</l>
      <l n="86">That , overcome by fright at last , she went</l>
      <l n="87">No farther , and her heart within her sank ;</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="30">
      <l n="88">And back she turned . And , even as she turned ,</l>
      <l n="89">The lightning ceased to flash , the air was dark ,</l>
      <l n="90">The thunder 's voice was hushed , the wind stood still ,</l>
      <l n="91">And all was silent round , and she ,— at rest !</l>
