    <head>INTRODUCTION .</head>

   <titlePage>
    <docTitle><titlePart>John Keble , two years older than his friend Dr. Arnold of Rugby , three years older than Thomas Carlyle , and nine years older than John Henry Newman , was born in 1792 , at Fairford in Gloucestershire . He was born in his father 's parsonage , and educated at home by his father till he went to college . His father then entered him at his own college at Oxford , Corpus Christi . Thoroughly trained , Keble obtained high reputation at his University for character and scholarship , and became a Fellow of Oriel . After some years he gave up work in the University , though he could not divest himself of a large influence there for good , returned home to his old father , who required help in his ministry , and undertook for his the duty of two little curacies . The father lived on to the age of ninety . John Keble 's love for God and his devotion to the Church had often been expressed in verse . On days which the Church specially celebrated , he had from time to time written short poems to utter from the heart his own devout sense of their spiritual use and meaning . As the number of these poems increased , the desire rose to follow in like manner the while course of the Christian Year as it was marked for the people by the sequence of church services , which had been arranged to bring in due order before the minds of Christian worshippers all the foundations of their faith , and all the elements of a religious life . A book of poems , breathing faith and worship at all points , and in all attitudes of heavenward contemplation , within the circle of the Christian Year , would , he hoped , restore in many minds to many a benumbed form life and energy .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>In<date>1825</date>, while the poems of the Christian Year were gradually being shaped into a single work , a brother became able to relieve John Keble in that pious care for which his father had drawn him away from a great University career , and he then went to a curacy at Hursley , four or five miles from Winchester .</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>In 1827 — when its author 's age was thirty-five — “ The Christian Year ” was published . Like George Herbert , whose equal he was in piety though not in power , Keble was joined to the Church in fullest sympathy with all its ordinances , and desired to quicken worship by putting into each part of the ritual a life that might pass into and raise the life of man . The spirit of true religion , with a power beyond that of any earthly feuds and controversies , binds together those in whom it really lives . Setting aside all smaller questions of the relative value of different earthly means to the attainment of a life hidden with Christ in God , Christians of all forms who are one in spirit have found help from “ John Keble 's Christian Year , and think of its guileless author with kindly affection . Within five - and-twenty years of its publication , a hundred thousand copies had been sold . The book is still diffused so widely , in editions of all forms , that it may yet go on , until the circle of the years shall be no more , living and making live .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>Four years after “ The Christian Year appeared , Keble was appointed ( in<date>1831</date>) to the usual five years ’ tenure of the Poetry Professorship at<settlement>Oxford</settlement>. Two years after he had been appointed Poetry Professor , he preached the Assize Sermon , and took for his theme “ National Apostasy . ” John Henry Newman , who had obtained his Fellowship at Oriel some years before the publication of “ The Christian Year , ” and was twenty-six years old when it appeared , received from it a strong impulse towards the endeavour to revive the spirit of the Church by restoring life and soul to all her ordinances , and even to the minutest detail of her ritual . The deep respect felt for the author of “ The Christian Year ” gave power to the sermon of<date>1833</date>upon National Apostasy , and made it the starting - point of the<settlement>Oxford</settlement>movement known as Tractarian , from the issue of tracts through which its promoters sought to stir life in the clergy and the people ; known also as Puseyite because it received help at the end of the year<date>1833</date>from Dr. Pusey , who was of like age with J. H. Newman , and then Regius Professor of Hebrew . There was a danger , which some then foresaw , in the nature of this endeavour to put life into the Church ; but we all now recognise the purity of Christian zeal that prompted the attempt to make dead forms of ceremonial glow again with spiritual fire , and serve as aids to the recovery of light and warmth in our devotions . It was in<date>1833</date>that Keble , by one earnest sermon , with a pure life at the back of it , and this book that had prepared the way , gave the direct impulse to an<settlement>Oxford</settlement>movement for the reformation of the Church . The movement then began . But Keble went back to his curacy at Hursley . Two years afterwards the curate became vicar , and then Keble married . His after-life continued innocent and happy . He and his wife died within two months of each other , in the came year ,<date>1866</date>. He had taken part with his friends at<settlement>Oxford</settlement>by writing five of their Tracts , publishing a few sermons that laboured towards the same end , and editing a “ Library of the Fathers . ” In<date>1847</date>he produced another volume of poems , “ Lyra Innocentium , ” which associated doctrines of the Church with the lives of children , whom he loved , though his own marriage was childless . The power of Keble 's verse lies in its truth . A faithful and pure nature , strong in home affections , full of love and reverence for all that is of heaven in our earthly lot , strives for the full consecration of man 's life with love and faith . There is no rare gift of genius . Keble is not in subtlety of thought or of expression another George Herbert , or another Henry Vaughan . But his voice is not the less in unison with theirs , for every note is true , and wins us by its purity . His also are melodies of the everlasting chime . “ And be ye sure that Love can bless E'en in this crowded loneliness , Where ever moving myriads seem to say , Go — thou art nought to us , nor we to thee — away ! ” “ There are in this loud stunning tide Of human care and crime , With whom the melodies abide Of the everlasting chime ; Who carry music in their heart Through dusky lane and wrangling mart , Plying their daily task with busier feet , Because their secret souls a holy strain repeat . ” With a peal , then , of such music let us ring in the New Year for our Library ; and for our lives . January 1 ,<date>1887</date>. H. M. DEDICATION . When in my silent solitary walk , I sought a strain not all unworthy Thee , My heart , still ringing with wild worldly talk , Gave forth no note of holier minstrelsy . Prayer is the secret , to myself I said , Strong supplication must call down the charm , And thus with untuned heart I feebly prayed , Knocking at Heaven 's gate with earth-palsied arm . Fountain of Harmony ! Thou Spirit blest , By whom the troubled waves of earthly sound Are gathered into order , such as best Some high-souled bard in his enchanted round May compass , Power divine ! Oh , spread Thy wing , Thy dovelike wing that makes confusion fly , Over my dark , void spirit , summoning New worlds of music , strains that may not die . Oh , happiest who before thine altar wait , With pure hands ever holding up on high The guiding Star of all who seek Thy gate , The undying lamp of heavenly Poesy . Too weak , too wavering , for such holy task Is my frail arm , O Lord ; but I would fain Track to its source the brightness , I would bask In the clear ray that makes Thy pathway plain . I dare not hope with David 's harp to chase The evil spirit from the troubled breast ; Enough for me if I can find such grace To listen to the strain , and be at rest .</docImprint>
