    <head>NOTE ON POEMS OF 1822 , BY MRS. SHELLEY .</head>
    <head>EARLY POEMS [ 1814 , 1815 ] .</head>
    <note>The poems which follow appeared , with a few exceptions , either in the volumes published from time to time by Shelley himself , or in the “ Posthumous Poems ” of 1824 , or in the “ Poetical Works ” of 1839 , of which a second and enlarged edition was published by Mrs. Shelley in the same year . A few made their first appearance in some fugitive publication — such as Leigh Hunt 's “ Literary Pocket-Book ” — and were subsequently incorporated in the collective editions . In every case the editio princeps and ( where this is possible ) the exact date of composition are indicated below the title .</note>

     <l n="5">That was the portion of despair !</l>

  <p>NOTE ON THE EARLY POEMS , BY MRS. SHELLEY .</p>
   <p>The remainder of Shelley 's Poems will be arranged in the order in which they were written . Of course , mistakes will occur in placing some of the shorter ones ; for , as I have said , many of these were thrown aside , and I never saw them till I had the misery of looking over his writings after the hand that traced them was dust ; and some were in the hands of others , and I never saw them till now . The subjects of the poems are often to me an unerring guide ; but on other occasions I can only guess , by finding them in the pages of the same manuscript book that contains poems with the date of whose composition I am fully conversant . In the present arrangement all his poetical translations will be placed together at the end .</p>
   <p>The loss of his early papers prevents my being able to give any of the poetry of his boyhood . Of the few I give as “ Early Poems ” , the greater part were published with “ Alastor ” ; some of them were written previously , some at the same period . The poem beginning ‘ Oh , there are spirits in the air ’ was addressed in idea to Coleridge , whom he never knew ; and at whose character he could only guess imperfectly , through his writings , and accounts he heard of him from some who knew him well . He regarded his change of opinions as rather an act of will than conviction , and believed that in his inner heart he would be haunted by what Shelley considered the better and holier aspirations of his youth . The summer evening that suggested to him the poem written in the churchyard of Lechlade occurred during his voyage up the Thames in 1815 . He had been advised by a physician to live as much as possible in the open air ; and a fortnight of a bright warm July was spent in tracing the Thames to its source . He never spent a season more tranquilly than the summer of 1815 . He had just recovered from a severe pulmonary attack ; the weather was warm and pleasant . He lived near Windsor Forest ; and his life was spent under its shades or on the water , meditating subjects for verse . Hitherto , he had chiefly aimed at extending his political doctrines , and attempted so to do by appeals in prose essays to the people , exhorting them to claim their rights ; but he had now begun to feel that the time for action was not ripe in England , and that the pen was the only instrument wherewith to prepare the way for better things .</p>
   <p>In the scanty journals kept during those years I find a record of the books that Shelley read during several years . During the years of 1814 and 1815 the list is extensive . It includes , in Greek , Homer , Hesiod , Theocritus , the histories of Thucydides and Herodotus , and Diogenes Laertius . In Latin , Petronius , Suetonius , some of the works of Cicero , a large proportion of those of Seneca and Livy . In English , Milton 's poems , Wordsworth 's “ Excursion ” , Southey 's “ Madoc ” and “ Thalaba ” , Locke “ On the Human Understanding ” , Bacon 's “ Novum Organum ” . In Italian , Ariosto , Tasso , and Alfieri . In French , the “ Reveries d'un Solitaire ” of Rousseau . To these may be added several modern books of travel . He read few novels .</p>

     <l n="46">Day 's ruddy light . The tomb of thy dead self</l>

     <l n="22">Thy giant brood of pines around thee clinging , 20</l>

     <l n="32">Thy caverns echoing to the Arve 's commotion , 30</l>

     <l n="39">My own , my human mind , which passively</l>
     <l n="40">Now renders and receives fast influencings ,</l>
     <l n="41">Holding an unremitting interchange</l>

     <l n="43">One legion of wild thoughts , whose wandering wings</l>
     <l n="44">Now float above thy darkness , and now rest</l>
     <l n="45">Where that or thou art no unbidden guest ,</l>
     <l n="46">In the still cave of the witch Poesy ,</l>

  <p>NOTE ON POEMS OF 1816 , BY MRS. SHELLEY .</p>
   <p>Shelley wrote little during this year . The poem entitled “ The Sunset ” was written in the spring of the year , while still residing at Bishopsgate . He spent the summer on the shores of the Lake of Geneva . The “ Hymn to Intellectual Beauty ” was conceived during his voyage round the lake with Lord Byron . He occupied himself during this voyage by reading the “ Nouvelle Heloise ” for the first time . The reading it on the very spot where the scenes are laid added to the interest ; and he was at once surprised and charmed by the passionate eloquence and earnest enthralling interest that pervade this work . There was something in the character of Saint-Preux , in his abnegation of self , and in the worship he paid to Love , that coincided with Shelley 's own disposition ; and , though differing in many of the views and shocked by others , yet the effect of the whole was fascinating and delightful .</p>
   <p>“ Mont Blanc ” was inspired by a view of that mountain and its surrounding peaks and valleys , as he lingered on the Bridge of Arve on his way through the Valley of Chamouni . Shelley makes the following mention of this poem in his publication of the “ History of a Six Weeks ’ Tour , and Letters from Switzerland ": ‘ The poem entitled “ Mont Blanc ” is written by the author of the two letters from Chamouni and Vevai . It was composed under the immediate impression of the deep and powerful feelings excited by the objects which it attempts to describe ; and , as an undisciplined overflowing of the soul , rests its claim to approbation on an attempt to imitate the untamable wildness and inaccessible solemnity from which those feelings sprang . ’</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">This was an eventful year , and less time was given to study than usual .</l>
     <l n="2">In the list of his reading I find , in Greek , Theocritus , the</l>
     <l n="3">“ Prometheus ” of Aeschylus , several of Plutarch 's “ Lives ” , and the works</l>
     <l n="4">of Lucian . In Latin , Lucretius , Pliny 's “ Letters ” , the “ Annals ” and</l>
     <l n="5">“ Germany ” of Tacitus . In French , the “ History of the French Revolution ”</l>
     <l n="6">by Lacretelle . He read for the first time , this year , Montaigne 's</l>
     <l n="7">“ Essays ” , and regarded them ever after as one of the most delightful</l>
     <l n="8">and instructive books in the world . The list is scanty in English</l>
     <l n="9">works : Locke 's “ Essay ” , “ Political Justice ” , and Coleridge 's “ Lay</l>
     <l n="10">Sermon ” , form nearly the whole . It was his frequent habit to read aloud</l>
     <l n="11">to me in the evening ; in this way we read , this year , the New</l>
     <l n="12">Testament , “ Paradise Lost ” , Spenser 's “ Faery Queen ” , and “ Don Quixote ” .</l>

     <l n="73">From touch of mortal instrument ,</l>

     <l n="119">Of the drowning mountains , in and out ,</l>

     <l n="161">With an earth-uplifting cataract :</l>
     <l n="162">The statues gave a joyous scream ,</l>
     <l n="163">And on its wings the pale thin Dream</l>
     <l n="164">Lifted the Lady from the stream . 140</l>

     <l n="165">23 .</l>
     <l n="166">The dizzy flight of that phantom pale</l>

     <l n="168">And she arose , while from the veil</l>
     <l n="169">Of her dark eyes the Dream did creep ,</l>
     <l n="170">And she walked about as one who knew 145</l>
     <l n="171">That sleep has sights as clear and true</l>
     <l n="172">As any waking eyes can view .</l>

   <p>TO CONSTANTIA , SINGING .</p>
   <note>Published by Mrs. Shelley in “ Posthumous Poems ” , 1824 . Amongst the Shelley manuscripts at the Bodleian is a chaotic first draft , from which Mr. Locock [ “ Examination ” , etc ., 1903 , pages 60-62 ] has , with patient ingenuity , disengaged a first and a second stanza consistent with the metrical scheme of stanzas 3 and 4 . The two stanzas thus recovered are printed here immediately below the poem as edited by Mrs. Shelley . It need hardly be added that Mr. Locock 's restored version cannot , any more than Mrs. Shelley 's obviously imperfect one , be regarded in the light of a final recension .</note>

  <p>NOTE ON POEMS OF 1817 , BY MRS. SHELLEY .</p>
   <p>The very illness that oppressed , and the aspect of death which had approached so near Shelley , appear to have kindled to yet keener life the Spirit of Poetry in his heart . The restless thoughts kept awake by pain clothed themselves in verse . Much was composed during this year . The “ Revolt of Islam ” , written and printed , was a great effort — “ Rosalind and Helen ” was begun — and the fragments and poems I can trace to the same period show how full of passion and reflection were his solitary hours .</p>
   <p>In addition to such poems as have an intelligible aim and shape , many a stray idea and transitory emotion found imperfect and abrupt expression , and then again lost themselves in silence . As he never wandered without a book and without implements of writing , I find many such , in his manuscript books , that scarcely bear record ; while some of them , broken and vague as they are , will appear valuable to those who love Shelley 's mind , and desire to trace its workings .</p>
   <p>He projected also translating the “ Hymns ” of Homer ; his version of several of the shorter ones remains , as well as that to Mercury already published in the “ Posthumous Poems ” . His readings this year were chiefly Greek . Besides the “ Hymns ” of Homer and the “ Iliad ” , he read the dramas of Aeschylus and Sophocles , the “ Symposium ” of Plato , and Arrian 's “ Historia Indica ” . In Latin , Apuleius alone is named . In English , the Bible was his constant study ; he read a great portion of it aloud in the evening . Among these evening readings I find also mentioned the “ Faerie Queen ” ; and other modern works , the production of his contemporaries , Coleridge , Wordsworth , Moore and Byron .</p>
   <p>His life was now spent more in thought than action — he had lost the eager spirit which believed it could achieve what it projected for the benefit of mankind . And yet in the converse of daily life Shelley was far from being a melancholy man . He was eloquent when philosophy or politics or taste were the subjects of conversation . He was playful ; and indulged in the wild spirit that mocked itself and others — not in bitterness , but in sport . The author of “ Nightmare Abbey ” seized on some points of his character and some habits of his life when he painted Scythrop . He was not addicted to ‘ port or madeira , ’ but in youth he had read of ‘ Illuminati and Eleutherarchs , ’ and believed that he possessed the power of operating an immediate change in the minds of men and the state of society . These wild dreams had faded ; sorrow and adversity had struck home ; but he struggled with despondency as he did with physical pain . There are few who remember him sailing paper boats , and watching the navigation of his tiny craft with eagerness — or repeating with wild energy “ The Ancient Mariner ” , and Southey 's “ Old Woman of Berkeley ” ; but those who do will recollect that it was in such , and in the creations of his own fancy when that was most daring and ideal , that he sheltered himself from the storms and disappointments , the pain and sorrow , that beset his life .</p>
   <p>No words can express the anguish he felt when his elder children were torn from him . In his first resentment against the Chancellor , on the passing of the decree , he had written a curse , in which there breathes , besides haughty indignation , all the tenderness of a father 's love , which could imagine and fondly dwell upon its loss and the consequences .</p>
   <p>At one time , while the question was still pending , the Chancellor had said some words that seemed to intimate that Shelley should not be permitted the care of any of his children , and for a moment he feared that our infant son would be torn from us . He did not hesitate to resolve , if such were menaced , to abandon country , fortune , everything , and to escape with his child ; and I find some unfinished stanzas addressed to this son , whom afterwards we lost at Rome , written under the idea that we might suddenly be forced to cross the sea , so to preserve him . This poem , as well as the one previously quoted , were not written to exhibit the pangs of distress to the public ; they were the spontaneous outbursts of a man who brooded over his wrongs and woes , and was impelled to shed the grace of his genius over the uncontrollable emotions of his heart . I ought to observe that the fourth verse of this effusion is introduced in “ Rosalind and Helen ” . When afterwards this child died at Rome , he wrote , a propos of the English burying-ground in that city : ‘ This spot is the repository of a sacred loss , of which the yearnings of a parent 's heart are now prophetic ; he is rendered immortal by love , as his memory is by death . My beloved child lies buried here . I envy death the body far less than the oppressors the minds of those whom they have torn from me . The one can only kill the body , the other crushes the affections . ’</p>

   <p>MADDALO , A COURTIER . MALPIGLIO , A POET . PIGNA , A MINISTER . ALBANO , AN USHER .</p>
   <p>MADDALO : No access to the Duke ! You have not said That the Count Maddalo would speak with him ?</p>
   <p>PIGNA : Did you inform his Grace that Signor Pigna Waits with state papers for his signature ?</p>
   <p>MALPIGLIO : The Lady Leonora cannot know 5 That I have written a sonnet to her fame , In which I ... Venus and Adonis . You should not take my gold and serve me not .</p>
   <p>ALBANO : In truth I told her , and she smiled and said , ‘ If I am Venus , thou , coy Poesy , 10 Art the Adonis whom I love , and he The Erymanthian boar that wounded him . ’ O trust to me , Signor Malpiglio , Those nods and smiles were favours worth the zechin .</p>
   <p>MALPIGLIO : The words are twisted in some double sense 15 That I reach not : the smiles fell not on me .</p>
   <p>PIGNA : How are the Duke and Duchess occupied ?</p>
   <p>ALBANO : Buried in some strange talk . The Duke was leaning , His finger on his brow , his lips unclosed . The Princess sate within the window-seat , 20 And so her face was hid ; but on her knee Her hands were clasped , veined , and pale as snow , And quivering — young Tasso , too , was there .</p>
   <p>MADDALO : Thou seest on whom from thine own worshipped heaven Thou drawest down smiles — they did not rain on thee . 25</p>
   <p>MALPIGLIO : Would they were parching lightnings for his sake On whom they fell !</p>

   <p>MARENGHI . ( This fragment refers to an event told in Sismondi 's “ Histoire des Republiques Italiennes ” , which occurred during the war when Florence finally subdued Pisa , and reduced it to a province .— [ MRS. SHELLEY 'S NOTE , 1824 . ])</p>
   <note>Published in part ( stanzas 7-15 . ) by Mrs. Shelley , “ Posthumous Poems ” , 1824 ; stanzas 1-28 by W. M . Rossetti , “ Complete Poetical Works of P. B. S . ” , 1870 . The Boscombe manuscript — evidently a first draft — from which ( through Dr. Garnett ) Rossetti derived the text of 1870 is now at the Bodleian , and has recently been collated by Mr. C. D . Locock , to whom the enlarged and amended text here printed is owing . The substitution , in title and text , of “ Marenghi ” for “ Mazenghi ” ( 1824 ) is due to Rossetti . Here as elsewhere in the footnotes B . = the Bodleian manuscript .</note>

  <p>NOTE ON POEMS OF 1818 , BY MRS. SHELLEY .</p>
   <p>We often hear of persons disappointed by a first visit to Italy . This was not Shelley 's case . The aspect of its nature , its sunny sky , its majestic storms , of the luxuriant vegetation of the country , and the noble marble-built cities , enchanted him . The sight of the works of art was full enjoyment and wonder . He had not studied pictures or statues before ; he now did so with the eye of taste , that referred not to the rules of schools , but to those of Nature and truth . The first entrance to Rome opened to him a scene of remains of antique grandeur that far surpassed his expectations ; and the unspeakable beauty of Naples and its environs added to the impression he received of the transcendent and glorious beauty of Italy .</p>
   <p>Our winter was spent at Naples . Here he wrote the fragments of “ Marenghi ” and “ The Woodman and the Nightingale ” , which he afterwards threw aside . At this time , Shelley suffered greatly in health . He put himself under the care of a medical man , who promised great things , and made him endure severe bodily pain , without any good results . Constant and poignant physical suffering exhausted him ; and though he preserved the appearance of cheerfulness , and often greatly enjoyed our wanderings in the environs of Naples , and our excursions on its sunny sea , yet many hours were passed when his thoughts , shadowed by illness , became gloomy ,— and then he escaped to solitude , and in verses , which he hid from fear of wounding me , poured forth morbid but too natural bursts of discontent and sadness . One looks back with unspeakable regret and gnawing remorse to such periods ; fancying that , had one been more alive to the nature of his feelings , and more attentive to soothe them , such would not have existed . And yet , enjoying as he appeared to do every sight or influence of earth or sky , it was difficult to imagine that any melancholy he showed was aught but the effect of the constant pain to which he was a martyr .</p>
   <p>We lived in utter solitude . And such is often not the nurse of cheerfulness ; for then , at least with those who have been exposed to adversity , the mind broods over its sorrows too intently ; while the society of the enlightened , the witty , and the wise , enables us to forget ourselves by making us the sharers of the thoughts of others , which is a portion of the philosophy of happiness . Shelley never liked society in numbers ,— it harassed and wearied him ; but neither did he like loneliness , and usually , when alone , sheltered himself against memory and reflection in a book . But , with one or two whom he loved , he gave way to wild and joyous spirits , or in more serious conversation expounded his opinions with vivacity and eloquence . If an argument arose , no man ever argued better . He was clear , logical , and earnest , in supporting his own views ; attentive , patient , and impartial , while listening to those on the adverse side . Had not a wall of prejudice been raised at this time between him and his countrymen , how many would have sought the acquaintance of one whom to know was to love and to revere ! How many of the more enlightened of his contemporaries have since regretted that they did not seek him ! how very few knew his worth while he lived ! and , of those few , several were withheld by timidity or envy from declaring their sense of it . But no man was ever more enthusiastically loved — more looked up to , as one superior to his fellows in intellectual endowments and moral worth , by the few who knew him well , and had sufficient nobleness of soul to appreciate his superiority . His excellence is now acknowledged ; but , even while admitted , not duly appreciated . For who , except those who were acquainted with him , can imagine his unwearied benevolence , his generosity , his systematic forbearance ? And still less is his vast superiority in intellectual attainments sufficiently understood — his sagacity , his clear understanding , his learning , his prodigious memory . All these as displayed in conversation , were known to few while he lived , and are now silent in the tomb :</p>

  <p>ODE TO THE WEST WIND .</p>
   <p>( This poem was conceived and chiefly written in a wood that skirts the Arno , near Florence , and on a day when that tempestuous wind , whose temperature is at once mild and animating , was collecting the vapours which pour down the autumnal rains . They began , as I foresaw , at sunset with a violent tempest of hail and rain , attended by that magnificent thunder and lightning peculiar to the Cisalpine regions .</p>
   <p>The phenomenon alluded to at the conclusion of the third stanza is well known to naturalists . The vegetation at the bottom of the sea , of rivers , and of lakes , sympathizes with that of the land in the change of seasons , and is consequently influenced by the winds which announce it .— [ SHELLEY 'S NOTE . ])</p>

   <p>NOTE ON POEMS OF 1819 , BY MRS. SHELLEY .</p>
   <p>Shelley loved the People ; and respected them as often more virtuous , as always more suffering , and therefore more deserving of sympathy , than the great . He believed that a clash between the two classes of society was inevitable , and he eagerly ranged himself on the people 's side . He had an idea of publishing a series of poems adapted expressly to commemorate their circumstances and wrongs . He wrote a few ; but , in those days of prosecution for libel , they could not be printed . They are not among the best of his productions , a writer being always shackled when he endeavours to write down to the comprehension of those who could not understand or feel a highly imaginative style ; but they show his earnestness , and with what heart-felt compassion he went home to the direct point of injury — that oppression is detestable as being the parent of starvation , nakedness , and ignorance . Besides these outpourings of compassion and indignation , he had meant to adorn the cause he loved with loftier poetry of glory and triumph : such is the scope of the “ Ode to the Assertors of Liberty ” . He sketched also a new version of our national anthem , as addressed to Liberty .</p>

      <l n="1">A Sensitive Plant in a garden grew ,</l>

  <p>A VISION OF THE SEA .</p>
   <note>Composed at Pisa early in 1820 , and published with “ Prometheus Unbound ” in the same year . A transcript in Mrs. Shelley 's handwriting is included in the Harvard manuscript book , where it is dated ‘ April , 1820 . ’</note>

     <l n="1">‘ Tis the terror of tempest . The rags of the sail</l>
     <l n="2">Are flickering in ribbons within the fierce gale :</l>
     <l n="3">From the stark night of vapours the dim rain is driven ,</l>
     <l n="4">And when lightning is loosed , like a deluge from Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="5">She sees the black trunks of the waterspouts spin 5</l>
     <l n="6">And bend , as if Heaven was ruining in ,</l>
     <l n="7">Which they seemed to sustain with their terrible mass</l>
     <l n="8">As if ocean had sunk from beneath them : they pass</l>
     <l n="9">To their graves in the deep with an earthquake of sound ,</l>
     <l n="10">And the waves and the thunders , made silent around , 10</l>
     <l n="11">Leave the wind to its echo . The vessel , now tossed</l>
     <l n="12">Through the low-trailing rack of the tempest , is lost</l>
     <l n="13">In the skirts of the thunder-cloud : now down the sweep</l>
     <l n="14">Of the wind-cloven wave to the chasm of the deep</l>
     <l n="15">It sinks , and the walls of the watery vale 15</l>
     <l n="16">Whose depths of dread calm are unmoved by the gale ,</l>
     <l n="17">Dim mirrors of ruin , hang gleaming about ;</l>
     <l n="18">While the surf , like a chaos of stars , like a rout</l>
     <l n="19">Of death-flames , like whirlpools of fire-flowing iron ,</l>
     <l n="20">With splendour and terror the black ship environ , 20</l>
     <l n="21">Or like sulphur-flakes hurled from a mine of pale fire</l>
     <l n="22">In fountains spout o'er it . In many a spire</l>
     <l n="23">The pyramid-billows with white points of brine</l>
     <l n="24">In the cope of the lightning inconstantly shine ,</l>
     <l n="25">As piercing the sky from the floor of the sea . 25</l>
     <l n="26">The great ship seems splitting ! it cracks as a tree ,</l>
     <l n="27">While an earthquake is splintering its root , ere the blast</l>
     <l n="28">Of the whirlwind that stripped it of branches has passed .</l>
     <l n="29">The intense thunder-balls which are raining from Heaven</l>
     <l n="30">Have shattered its mast , and it stands black and riven . 30</l>
     <l n="31">The chinks suck destruction . The heavy dead hulk</l>
     <l n="32">On the living sea rolls an inanimate bulk ,</l>
     <l n="33">Like a corpse on the clay which is hungering to fold</l>
     <l n="34">Its corruption around it . Meanwhile , from the hold ,</l>
     <l n="35">One deck is burst up by the waters below , 35</l>
     <l n="36">And it splits like the ice when the thaw-breezes blow</l>
     <l n="37">O'er the lakes of the desert ! Who sit on the other ?</l>
     <l n="38">Is that all the crew that lie burying each other ,</l>
     <l n="39">Like the dead in a breach , round the foremast ? Are those</l>
     <l n="40">Twin tigers , who burst , when the waters arose , 40</l>
     <l n="41">In the agony of terror , their chains in the hold ;</l>
     <l n="42">( What now makes them tame , is what then made them bold ;)</l>
     <l n="43">Who crouch , side by side , and have driven , like a crank ,</l>
     <l n="44">The deep grip of their claws through the vibrating plank</l>
     <l n="45">Are these all ? Nine weeks the tall vessel had lain 45</l>
     <l n="46">On the windless expanse of the watery plain ,</l>
     <l n="47">Where the death-darting sun cast no shadow at noon ,</l>
     <l n="48">And there seemed to be fire in the beams of the moon ,</l>
     <l n="49">Till a lead-coloured fog gathered up from the deep ,</l>
     <l n="50">Whose breath was quick pestilence ; then , the cold sleep 50</l>
     <l n="51">Crept , like blight through the ears of a thick field of corn ,</l>
     <l n="52">O'er the populous vessel . And even and morn ,</l>
     <l n="53">With their hammocks for coffins the seamen aghast</l>
     <l n="54">Like dead men the dead limbs of their comrades cast</l>
     <l n="55">Down the deep , which closed on them above and around , 55</l>
     <l n="56">And the sharks and the dogfish their grave-clothes unbound ,</l>
     <l n="57">And were glutted like Jews with this manna rained down</l>
     <l n="58">From God on their wilderness . One after one</l>
     <l n="59">The mariners died ; on the eve of this day ,</l>
     <l n="60">When the tempest was gathering in cloudy array , 60</l>
     <l n="61">But seven remained . Six the thunder has smitten ,</l>
     <l n="62">And they lie black as mummies on which Time has written</l>
     <l n="63">His scorn of the embalmer ; the seventh , from the deck</l>
     <l n="64">An oak-splinter pierced through his breast and his back ,</l>
     <l n="65">And hung out to the tempest , a wreck on the wreck . 65</l>
     <l n="66">No more ? At the helm sits a woman more fair</l>
     <l n="67">Than Heaven , when , unbinding its star-braided hair ,</l>
     <l n="68">It sinks with the sun on the earth and the sea .</l>
     <l n="69">She clasps a bright child on her upgathered knee ;</l>
     <l n="70">It laughs at the lightning , it mocks the mixed thunder 70</l>
     <l n="71">Of the air and the sea , with desire and with wonder</l>
     <l n="72">It is beckoning the tigers to rise and come near ,</l>
     <l n="73">It would play with those eyes where the radiance of fear</l>
     <l n="74">Is outshining the meteors ; its bosom beats high ,</l>
     <l n="75">The heart-fire of pleasure has kindled its eye , 75</l>
     <l n="76">While its mother 's is lustreless . ‘ Smile not , my child ,</l>
     <l n="77">But sleep deeply and sweetly , and so be beguiled</l>
     <l n="78">Of the pang that awaits us , whatever that be ,</l>
     <l n="79">So dreadful since thou must divide it with me !</l>
     <l n="80">Dream , sleep ! This pale bosom , thy cradle and bed , 80</l>
     <l n="81">Will it rock thee not , infant ? ‘ Tis beating with dread !</l>
     <l n="82">Alas ! what is life , what is death , what are we ,</l>
     <l n="83">That when the ship sinks we no longer may be ?</l>
     <l n="84">What ! to see thee no more , and to feel thee no more ?</l>
     <l n="85">To be after life what we have been before ? 85</l>
     <l n="86">Not to touch those sweet hands ? Not to look on those eyes ,</l>
     <l n="87">Those lips , and that hair ,— all the smiling disguise</l>
     <l n="88">Thou yet wearest , sweet Spirit , which I , day by day ,</l>
     <l n="89">Have so long called my child , but which now fades away</l>
     <l n="90">Like a rainbow , and I the fallen shower ? ’ — Lo ! the ship 90</l>
     <l n="91">Is settling , it topples , the leeward ports dip ;</l>
     <l n="92">The tigers leap up when they feel the slow brine</l>
     <l n="93">Crawling inch by inch on them ; hair , ears , limbs , and eyne ,</l>
     <l n="94">Stand rigid with horror ; a loud , long , hoarse cry</l>
     <l n="95">Bursts at once from their vitals tremendously , 95</l>
     <l n="96">And ‘ tis borne down the mountainous vale of the wave ,</l>
     <l n="97">Rebounding , like thunder , from crag to cave ,</l>
     <l n="98">Mixed with the clash of the lashing rain ,</l>
     <l n="99">Hurried on by the might of the hurricane :</l>
     <l n="100">The hurricane came from the west , and passed on 100</l>
     <l n="101">By the path of the gate of the eastern sun ,</l>
     <l n="102">Transversely dividing the stream of the storm ;</l>
     <l n="103">As an arrowy serpent , pursuing the form</l>
     <l n="104">Of an elephant , bursts through the brakes of the waste .</l>
     <l n="105">Black as a cormorant the screaming blast , 105</l>
     <l n="106">Between Ocean and Heaven , like an ocean , passed ,</l>
     <l n="107">Till it came to the clouds on the verge of the world</l>
     <l n="108">Which , based on the sea and to Heaven upcurled ,</l>
     <l n="109">Like columns and walls did surround and sustain</l>
     <l n="110">The dome of the tempest ; it rent them in twain , 110</l>
     <l n="111">As a flood rends its barriers of mountainous crag :</l>
     <l n="112">And the dense clouds in many a ruin and rag ,</l>
     <l n="113">Like the stones of a temple ere earthquake has passed ,</l>
     <l n="114">Like the dust of its fall . on the whirlwind are cast ;</l>
     <l n="115">They are scattered like foam on the torrent ; and where 115</l>
     <l n="116">The wind has burst out through the chasm , from the air</l>
     <l n="117">Of clear morning the beams of the sunrise flow in ,</l>
     <l n="118">Unimpeded , keen , golden , and crystalline ,</l>
     <l n="119">Banded armies of light and of air ; at one gate</l>
     <l n="120">They encounter , but interpenetrate . 120</l>
     <l n="121">And that breach in the tempest is widening away ,</l>
     <l n="122">And the caverns of cloud are torn up by the day ,</l>
     <l n="123">And the fierce winds are sinking with weary wings ,</l>
     <l n="124">Lulled by the motion and murmurings</l>
     <l n="125">And the long glassy heave of the rocking sea , 125</l>
     <l n="126">And overhead glorious , but dreadful to see ,</l>
     <l n="127">The wrecks of the tempest , like vapours of gold ,</l>
     <l n="128">Are consuming in sunrise . The heaped waves behold</l>
     <l n="129">The deep calm of blue Heaven dilating above ,</l>
     <l n="130">And , like passions made still by the presence of Love , 130</l>
     <l n="131">Beneath the clear surface reflecting it slide</l>
     <l n="132">Tremulous with soft influence ; extending its tide</l>
     <l n="133">From the Andes to Atlas , round mountain and isle ,</l>
     <l n="134">Round sea-birds and wrecks , paved with Heaven 's azure smile ,</l>
     <l n="135">The wide world of waters is vibrating . Where 135</l>
     <l n="136">Is the ship ? On the verge of the wave where it lay</l>
     <l n="137">One tiger is mingled in ghastly affray</l>
     <l n="138">With a sea-snake . The foam and the smoke of the battle</l>
     <l n="139">Stain the clear air with sunbows ; the jar , and the rattle</l>
     <l n="140">Of solid bones crushed by the infinite stress 140</l>
     <l n="141">Of the snake 's adamantine voluminousness ;</l>
     <l n="142">And the hum of the hot blood that spouts and rains</l>
     <l n="143">Where the gripe of the tiger has wounded the veins</l>
     <l n="144">Swollen with rage , strength , and effort ; the whirl and the splash</l>
     <l n="145">As of some hideous engine whose brazen teeth smash 145</l>
     <l n="146">The thin winds and soft waves into thunder ; the screams</l>
     <l n="147">And hissings crawl fast o'er the smooth ocean-streams ,</l>
     <l n="148">Each sound like a centipede . Near this commotion ,</l>
     <l n="149">A blue shark is hanging within the blue ocean ,</l>
     <l n="150">The fin-winged tomb of the victor . The other 150</l>
     <l n="151">Is winning his way from the fate of his brother</l>
     <l n="152">To his own with the speed of despair . Lo ! a boat</l>
     <l n="153">Advances ; twelve rowers with the impulse of thought</l>
     <l n="154">Urge on the keen keel ,— the brine foams . At the stern</l>
     <l n="155">Three marksmen stand levelling . Hot bullets burn 155</l>
     <l n="156">In the breast of the tiger , which yet bears him on</l>
     <l n="157">To his refuge and ruin . One fragment alone ,—</l>
     <l n="158">‘ Tis dwindling and sinking , ‘ tis now almost gone ,—</l>
     <l n="159">Of the wreck of the vessel peers out of the sea .</l>
     <l n="160">With her left hand she grasps it impetuously . 160</l>
     <l n="161">With her right she sustains her fair infant . Death , Fear ,</l>
     <l n="162">Love , Beauty , are mixed in the atmosphere ,</l>
     <l n="163">Which trembles and burns with the fervour of dread</l>
     <l n="164">Around her wild eyes , her bright hand , and her head ,</l>
     <l n="165">Like a meteor of light o'er the waters ! her child 165</l>
     <l n="166">Is yet smiling , and playing , and murmuring ; so smiled</l>
     <l n="167">The false deep ere the storm . Like a sister and brother</l>
     <l n="168">The child and the ocean still smile on each other ,</l>
     <l n="169">Whilst —</l>

     <l n="1">I bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers ,</l>
     <l n="2">From the seas and the streams ;</l>
     <l n="3">I bear light shade for the leaves when laid</l>
     <l n="4">In their noonday dreams .</l>
     <l n="5">From my wings are shaken the dews that waken 5</l>
     <l n="6">The sweet buds every one ,</l>
     <l n="7">When rocked to rest on their mother 's breast ,</l>
     <l n="8">As she dances about the sun .</l>
     <l n="9">I wield the flail of the lashing hail ,</l>
     <l n="10">And whiten the green plains under , 10</l>
     <l n="11">And then again I dissolve it in rain ,</l>
     <l n="12">And laugh as I pass in thunder .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">I sift the snow on the mountains below ,</l>
     <l n="14">And their great pines groan aghast ;</l>
     <l n="15">And all the night ‘ tis my pillow white , 15</l>
     <l n="16">While I sleep in the arms of the blast .</l>
     <l n="17">Sublime on the towers of my skiey bowers ,</l>
     <l n="18">Lightning my pilot sits ;</l>
     <l n="19">In a cavern under is fettered the thunder ,</l>
     <l n="20">It struggles and howls at fits ; 20</l>
     <l n="21">Over earth and ocean , with gentle motion ,</l>
     <l n="22">This pilot is guiding me ,</l>
     <l n="23">Lured by the love of the genii that move</l>
     <l n="24">In the depths of the purple sea ;</l>
     <l n="25">Over the rills , and the crags , and the hills . 25</l>
     <l n="26">Over the lakes and the plains ,</l>
     <l n="27">Wherever he dream , under mountain or stream ,</l>
     <l n="28">The Spirit he loves remains ;</l>
     <l n="29">And I all the while bask in Heaven 's blue smile ,</l>
     <l n="30">Whilst he is dissolving in rains . 30</l>

     <l n="31">The sanguine Sunrise , with his meteor eyes ,</l>
     <l n="32">And his burning plumes outspread ,</l>
     <l n="33">Leaps on the back of my sailing rack ,</l>
     <l n="34">When the morning star shines dead ;</l>
     <l n="35">As on the jag of a mountain crag , 35</l>
     <l n="36">Which an earthquake rocks and swings ,</l>
     <l n="37">An eagle alit one moment may sit</l>
     <l n="38">In the light of its golden wings .</l>
     <l n="39">And when Sunset may breathe , from the lit sea beneath ,</l>
     <l n="40">Its ardours of rest and of love , 40</l>
     <l n="41">And the crimson pall of eve may fall</l>
     <l n="42">From the depth of Heaven above .</l>
     <l n="43">With wings folded I rest , on mine aery nest ,</l>
     <l n="44">As still as a brooding dove .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="45">That orbed maiden with white fire laden , 45</l>
     <l n="46">Whom mortals call the Moon ,</l>
     <l n="47">Glides glimmering o'er my fleece-like floor ,</l>
     <l n="48">By the midnight breezes strewn ;</l>
     <l n="49">And wherever the beat of her unseen feet ,</l>
     <l n="50">Which only the angels hear , 50</l>
     <l n="51">May have broken the woof of my tent 's thin roof .</l>
     <l n="52">The stars peep behind her and peer ;</l>
     <l n="53">And I laugh to see them whirl and flee ,</l>
     <l n="54">Like a swarm of golden bees .</l>
     <l n="55">When I widen the rent in my wind-built tent , 55</l>
     <l n="56">Till the calm rivers , lakes , and seas ,</l>
     <l n="57">Like strips of the sky fallen through me on high ,</l>
     <l n="58">Are each paved with the moon and these .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="59">I bind the Sun 's throne with a burning zone ,</l>
     <l n="60">And the Moon 's with a girdle of pearl ; 60</l>
     <l n="61">The volcanoes are dim , and the stars reel and swim ,</l>
     <l n="62">When the whirlwinds my banner unfurl .</l>
     <l n="63">From cape to cape , with a bridge-like shape ,</l>
     <l n="64">Over a torrent sea ,</l>
     <l n="65">Sunbeam-proof , I hand like a roof ,— 65</l>
     <l n="66">The mountains its columns be .</l>
     <l n="67">The triumphal arch through which I march</l>
     <l n="68">With hurricane , fire , and snow ,</l>
     <l n="69">When the Powers of the air are chained to my chair ,</l>
     <l n="70">Is the million-coloured bow ; 70</l>
     <l n="71">The sphere-fire above its soft colours wove ,</l>
     <l n="72">While the moist Earth was laughing below .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="73">I am the daughter of Earth and Water ,</l>

     <l n="76">I change , but I cannot die .</l>
     <l n="77">For after the rain when with never a stain</l>
     <l n="78">The pavilion of Heaven is bare ,</l>
     <l n="79">And the winds and sunbeams with their convex gleams</l>
     <l n="80">Build up the blue dome of air , 80</l>
     <l n="81">I silently laugh at my own cenotaph ,</l>
     <l n="82">And out of the caverns of rain ,</l>
     <l n="83">Like a child from the womb , like a ghost from the tomb ,</l>

    <head>THE TWO SPIRITS : AN ALLEGORY .</head>
     <l n="1">[ Published by Mrs. Shelley , “ Posthumous Poems ” , 1824 . ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>FIRST SPIRIT : O thou , who plumed with strong desire Wouldst float above the earth , beware ! A Shadow tracks thy flight of fire — Night is coming ! Bright are the regions of the air , 5 And among the winds and beams It were delight to wander there — Night is coming !</p>
   <p>SECOND SPIRIT : The deathless stars are bright above ; If I would cross the shade of night , 10 Within my heart is the lamp of love , And that is day ! And the moon will smile with gentle light On my golden plumes where'er they move ; The meteors will linger round my flight , 15 And make night day .</p>
   <p>FIRST SPIRIT : But if the whirlwinds of darkness waken Hail , and lightning , and stormy rain ; See , the bounds of the air are shaken — Night is coming ! 20 The red swift clouds of the hurricane Yon declining sun have overtaken , The clash of the hail sweeps over the plain — Night is coming !</p>
   <p>SECOND SPIRIT : I see the light , and I hear the sound ; 25 I 'll sail on the flood of the tempest dark With the calm within and the light around Which makes night day : And thou , when the gloom is deep and stark , Look from thy dull earth , slumber-bound , 30 My moon-like flight thou then mayst mark On high , far away .</p>

   <p>ODE TO NAPLES .</p>
   <p>( The Author has connected many recollections of his visit to Pompeii and Baiae with the enthusiasm excited by the intelligence of the proclamation of a Constitutional Government at Naples . This has given a tinge of picturesque and descriptive imagery to the introductory Epodes which depicture these scenes , and some of the majestic feelings permanently connected with the scene of this animating event .— [ SHELLEY 'S NOTE . ])</p>
   <note>Composed at San Juliano di Pisa , August 17-25 , 1820 ; published in “ Posthumous Poems ” , 1824 . There is a copy , ‘ for the most part neat and legible , ’ amongst the Shelley manuscripts at the Bodleian Library . See Mr. C. D . Locock 's “ Examination ” , etc ., 1903 , pages 14-18 .</note>

   <p>A : Not far from hence . From yonder pointed hill , Crowned with a ring of oaks , you may behold A dark and barren field , through which there flows , Sluggish and black , a deep but narrow stream , Which the wind ripples not , and the fair moon 5 Gazes in vain , and finds no mirror there . Follow the herbless banks of that strange brook Until you pause beside a darksome pond , The fountain of this rivulet , whose gush Cannot be seen , hid by a rayless night 10 That lives beneath the overhanging rock That shades the pool — an endless spring of gloom , Upon whose edge hovers the tender light , Trembling to mingle with its paramour ,— But , as Syrinx fled Pan , so night flies day , 15 Or , with most sullen and regardless hate , Refuses stern her heaven-born embrace . On one side of this jagged and shapeless hill There is a cave , from which there eddies up A pale mist , like aereal gossamer , 20 Whose breath destroys all life — awhile it veils The rock — then , scattered by the wind , it flies Along the stream , or lingers on the clefts , Killing the sleepy worms , if aught bide there . Upon the beetling edge of that dark rock 25 There stands a group of cypresses ; not such As , with a graceful spire and stirring life , Pierce the pure heaven of your native vale , Whose branches the air plays among , but not Disturbs , fearing to spoil their solemn grace ; 30 But blasted and all wearily they stand , One to another clinging ; their weak boughs Sigh as the wind buffets them , and they shake Beneath its blasts — a weatherbeaten crew !</p>
   <p>CHORUS : What wondrous sound is that , mournful and faint , 35 But more melodious than the murmuring wind Which through the columns of a temple glides ?</p>
   <p>A : It is the wandering voice of Orpheus ’ lyre , Borne by the winds , who sigh that their rude king Hurries them fast from these air-feeding notes ; 40 But in their speed they bear along with them The waning sound , scattering it like dew Upon the startled sense .</p>
   <p>CHORUS : Does he still sing ? Methought he rashly cast away his harp When he had lost Eurydice .</p>
   <p>A : Ah , no ! 45 Awhile he paused . As a poor hunted stag A moment shudders on the fearful brink Of a swift stream — the cruel hounds press on With deafening yell , the arrows glance and wound ,— He plunges in : so Orpheus , seized and torn 50 By the sharp fangs of an insatiate grief , Maenad-like waved his lyre in the bright air , And wildly shrieked ‘ Where she is , it is dark ! ’ And then he struck from forth the strings a sound Of deep and fearful melody . Alas ! 55 In times long past , when fair Eurydice With her bright eyes sat listening by his side , He gently sang of high and heavenly themes . As in a brook , fretted with little waves By the light airs of spring — each riplet makes 60 A many-sided mirror for the sun , While it flows musically through green banks , Ceaseless and pauseless , ever clear and fresh , So flowed his song , reflecting the deep joy And tender love that fed those sweetest notes , 65 The heavenly offspring of ambrosial food . But that is past . Returning from drear Hell , He chose a lonely seat of unhewn stone , Blackened with lichens , on a herbless plain . Then from the deep and overflowing spring 70 Of his eternal ever-moving grief There rose to Heaven a sound of angry song . ‘ Tis as a mighty cataract that parts Two sister rocks with waters swift and strong , 75 And casts itself with horrid roar and din Adown a steep ; from a perennial source It ever flows and falls , and breaks the air With loud and fierce , but most harmonious roar , And as it falls casts up a vaporous spray Which the sun clothes in hues of Iris light . 80 Thus the tempestuous torrent of his grief Is clothed in sweetest sounds and varying words Of poesy . Unlike all human works , It never slackens , and through every change Wisdom and beauty and the power divine 85 Of mighty poesy together dwell , Mingling in sweet accord . As I have seen A fierce south blast tear through the darkened sky , Driving along a rack of winged clouds , Which may not pause , but ever hurry on , 90 As their wild shepherd wills them , while the stars , Twinkling and dim , peep from between the plumes . Anon the sky is cleared , and the high dome Of serene Heaven , starred with fiery flowers , Shuts in the shaken earth ; or the still moon 95 Swiftly , yet gracefully , begins her walk , Rising all bright behind the eastern hills . I talk of moon , and wind , and stars , and not Of song ; but , would I echo his high song , Nature must lend me words ne'er used before , 100 Or I must borrow from her perfect works , To picture forth his perfect attributes . He does no longer sit upon his throne Of rock upon a desert herbless plain , For the evergreen and knotted ilexes , 105 And cypresses that seldom wave their boughs , And sea-green olives with their grateful fruit , And elms dragging along the twisted vines , Which drop their berries as they follow fast , And blackthorn bushes with their infant race 110 Of blushing rose-blooms ; beeches , to lovers dear , And weeping willow trees ; all swift or slow , As their huge boughs or lighter dress permit , Have circled in his throne , and Earth herself Has sent from her maternal breast a growth 115 Of starlike flowers and herbs of odour sweet , To pave the temple that his poesy Has framed , while near his feet grim lions couch , And kids , fearless from love , creep near his lair . Even the blind worms seem to feel the sound . 120 The birds are silent , hanging down their heads , Perched on the lowest branches of the trees ; Not even the nightingale intrudes a note In rivalry , but all entranced she listens .</p>

    <p n="11">NOTE ON POEMS OF 1820 , BY MRS. SHELLEY .</p>
    <p n="12">We spent the latter part of the year 1819 in Florence , where Shelley passed several hours daily in the Gallery , and made various notes on its ancient works of art . His thoughts were a good deal taken up also by the project of a steamboat , undertaken by a friend , an engineer , to ply between Leghorn and Marseilles , for which he supplied a sum of money . This was a sort of plan to delight Shelley , and he was greatly disappointed when it was thrown aside .</p>
    <p n="13">There was something in Florence that disagreed excessively with his health , and he suffered far more pain than usual ; so much so that we left it sooner than we intended , and removed to Pisa , where we had some friends , and , above all , where we could consult the celebrated Vacca as to the cause of Shelley 's sufferings . He , like every other medical man , could only guess at that , and gave little hope of immediate relief ; he enjoined him to abstain from all physicians and medicine , and to leave his complaint to Nature . As he had vainly consulted medical men of the highest repute in England , he was easily persuaded to adopt this advice . Pain and ill-health followed him to the end ; but the residence at Pisa agreed with him better than any other , and there in consequence we remained .</p>
    <p n="14">In the Spring we spent a week or two near Leghorn , borrowing the house of some friends who were absent on a journey to England . It was on a beautiful summer evening , while wandering among the lanes whose myrtle-hedges were the bowers of the fire-flies , that we heard the carolling of the skylark which inspired one of the most beautiful of his poems . He addressed the letter to Mrs. Gisborne from this house , which was hers : he had made his study of the workshop of her son , who was an engineer . Mrs. Gisborne had been a friend of my father in her younger days . She was a lady of great accomplishments , and charming from her frank and affectionate nature . She had the most intense love of knowledge , a delicate and trembling sensibility , and preserved freshness of mind after a life of considerable adversity . As a favourite friend of my father , we had sought her with eagerness ; and the most open and cordial friendship was established between us .</p>
    <p n="15">Our stay at the Baths of San Giuliano was shortened by an accident . At the foot of our garden ran the canal that communicated between the Serchio and the Arno . The Serchio overflowed its banks , and , breaking its bounds , this canal also overflowed ; all this part of the country is below the level of its rivers , and the consequence was that it was speedily flooded . The rising waters filled the Square of the Baths , in the lower part of which our house was situated . The canal overflowed in the garden behind ; the rising waters on either side at last burst open the doors , and , meeting in the house , rose to the height of six feet . It was a picturesque sight at night to see the peasants driving the cattle from the plains below to the hills above the Baths . A fire was kept up to guide them across the ford ; and the forms of the men and the animals showed in dark relief against the red glare of the flame , which was reflected again in the waters that filled the Square .</p>
    <p n="16">We then removed to Pisa , and took up our abode there for the winter . The extreme mildness of the climate suited Shelley , and his solitude was enlivened by an intercourse with several intimate friends . Chance cast us strangely enough on this quiet half-unpeopled town ; but its very peace suited Shelley . Its river , the near mountains , and not distant sea , added to its attractions , and were the objects of many delightful excursions . We feared the south of Italy , and a hotter climate , on account of our child ; our former bereavement inspiring us with terror . We seemed to take root here , and moved little afterwards ; often , indeed , entertaining projects for visiting other parts of Italy , but still delaying . But for our fears on account of our child , I believe we should have wandered over the world , both being passionately fond of travelling . But human life , besides its great unalterable necessities , is ruled by a thousand lilliputian ties that shackle at the time , although it is difficult to account afterwards for their influence over our destiny .</p>

Out of the misty eastern cave , Where , all the long and lone daylight , Thou wovest dreams of joy and fear , 5 ‘ Which make thee terrible and dear ,— Swift be thy flight ! 2 . Wrap thy form in a mantle gray , Star-inwrought ! Blind with thine hair the eyes of Day ; 10 Kiss her until she be wearied out , Then wander o'er city , and sea , and land , Touching all with thine opiate wand — Come , long-sought ! 3 . When I arose and saw the dawn , 15 I sighed for thee ; When light rode high , and the dew was gone , And noon lay heavy on flower and tree , And the weary Day turned to his rest , Lingering like an unloved guest , I sighed for thee . 20 4 . Thy brother Death came , and cried , Wouldst thou me ? Thy sweet child Sleep , the filmy-eyed , Murmured like a noontide bee , 25 Shall I nestle near thy side ? Wouldst thou me ?— And I replied , No , not thee ! 5 . Death will come when thou art dead , Soon , too soon — 30 Sleep will come when thou art fled ; Of neither would I ask the boon I ask of thee , beloved Night — Swift be thine approaching flight , Come soon , soon ! 35</p>

Embleming love and health , which never yet In the same wreath might be . Alas , and they are wet ! 5 Is it with thy kisses or thy tears ? For never rain or dew Such fragrance drew From plant or flower — the very doubt endears My sadness ever new , 10 The sighs I breathe , the tears I shed for thee . 2 . Send the stars light , but send not love to me , In whom love ever made Health like a heap of embers soon to fade — THE FUGITIVES . [ Published by Mrs. Shelley , “ Posthumous Poems ” . 1824 . ] 1 . The waters are flashing , The white hail is dashing , The lightnings are glancing , The hoar-spray is dancing — Away ! 5 The whirlwind is rolling , The thunder is tolling , The forest is swinging , The minster bells ringing — Come away ! 10 The Earth is like Ocean , Wreck-strewn and in motion : Bird , beast , man and worm Have crept out of the storm — Come away ! 15 2 . ‘ Our boat has one sail And the helmsman is pale ;— A bold pilot I trow , Who should follow us now , ’ — Shouted he — 20 And she cried : ‘ Ply the oar ! Put off gaily from shore ! ’ — As she spoke , bolts of death Mixed with hail , specked their path O'er the sea . 25 And from isle , tower and rock , The blue beacon-cloud broke , And though dumb in the blast , The red cannon flashed fast From the lee . 30 3 . And ‘ Fear'st thou ? ’ and ‘ Fear'st thou ? ’ And Seest thou ? ’ and ‘ Hear'st thou ? ’ And ‘ Drive we not free O'er the terrible sea , I and thou ? ’ 35 One boat-cloak did cover The loved and the lover — Their blood beats one measure , They murmur proud pleasure Soft and low ;— 40 While around the lashed Ocean , Like mountains in motion , Is withdrawn and uplifted , Sunk , shattered and shifted To and fro . 45 4 . In the court of the fortress Beside the pale portress , Like a bloodhound well beaten The bridegroom stands , eaten By shame ; 50 On the topmost watch-turret , As a death-boding spirit Stands the gray tyrant father , To his voice the mad weather Seems tame ; 55 And with curses as wild As e'er clung to child , He devotes to the blast , The best , loveliest and last Of his name ! 60</p>

    <p>TO EDWARD WILLIAMS . [ Published in Ascham 's edition of the “ Poems ” , 1834 . There is a copy amongst the Trelawny manuscripts . ] 1 . The serpent is shut out from Paradise . The wounded deer must seek the herb no more In which its heart-cure lies : The widowed dove must cease to haunt a bower Like that from which its mate with feigned sighs 5 Fled in the April hour . I too must seldom seek again Near happy friends a mitigated pain . 2 . Of hatred I am proud ,— with scorn content ; Indifference , that once hurt me , now is grown 10 Itself indifferent ; But , not to speak of love , pity alone Can break a spirit already more than bent . The miserable one Turns the mind 's poison into food ,— 15 Its medicine is tears ,— its evil good . 3 . Therefore , if now I see you seldomer , Dear friends , dear FRIEND ! know that I only fly Your looks , because they stir Griefs that should sleep , and hopes that cannot die : 20 The very comfort that they minister I scarce can bear , yet I , So deeply is the arrow gone , Should quickly perish if it were withdrawn . 4 . When I return to my cold home , you ask 25 Why I am not as I have ever been . YOU spoil me for the task Of acting a forced part in life 's dull scene ,— Of wearing on my brow the idle mask Of author , great or mean , 30 In the world 's carnival . I sought Peace thus , and but in you I found it not . 5 . Full half an hour , to-day , I tried my lot With various flowers , and every one still said , ‘ She loves me — loves me not . ’ 35 And if this meant a vision long since fled — If it meant fortune , fame , or peace of thought — If it meant ,— but I dread To speak what you may know too well : Still there was truth in the sad oracle . 40 6 . The crane o'er seas and forests seeks her home ; No bird so wild but has its quiet nest , When it no more would roam ; The sleepless billows on the ocean 's breast Break like a bursting heart , and die in foam , 45 And thus at length find rest : Doubtless there is a place of peace Where MY weak heart and all its throbs will cease . 7 . I asked her , yesterday , if she believed That I had resolution . One who HAD 50 Would ne'er have thus relieved His heart with words ,— but what his judgement bade Would do , and leave the scorner unrelieved . These verses are too sad To send to you , but that I know , 55 Happy yourself , you feel another 's woe .</p>

    <p n="83">And many there were hurt by that strong boy , His name , they said , was Pleasure , And near him stood , glorious beyond measure Four Ladies who possess all empery In earth and air and sea , 5 Nothing that lives from their award is free . Their names will I declare to thee , Love , Hope , Desire , and Fear , And they the regents are Of the four elements that frame the heart , 10 And each diversely exercised her art By force or circumstance or sleight To prove her dreadful might Upon that poor domain . Desire presented her [ false ] glass , and then 15 The spirit dwelling there Was spellbound to embrace what seemed so fair Within that magic mirror , And dazed by that bright error , It would have scorned the [ shafts ] of the avenger 20 And death , and penitence , and danger , Had not then silent Fear Touched with her palsying spear , So that as if a frozen torrent The blood was curdled in its current ; 25 It dared not speak , even in look or motion , But chained within itself its proud devotion . Between Desire and Fear thou wert A wretched thing , poor heart ! Sad was his life who bore thee in his breast , 30 Wild bird for that weak nest . Till Love even from fierce Desire it bought , And from the very wound of tender thought Drew solace , and the pity of sweet eyes Gave strength to bear those gentle agonies , 35 Surmount the loss , the terror , and the sorrow . Then Hope approached , she who can borrow For poor to-day , from rich tomorrow , And Fear withdrew , as night when day Descends upon the orient ray , 40 And after long and vain endurance The poor heart woke to her assurance . — At one birth these four were born With the world 's forgotten morn , And from Pleasure still they hold 45 All it circles , as of old . When , as summer lures the swallow , Pleasure lures the heart to follow — O weak heart of little wit ! The fair hand that wounded it , 50 Seeking , like a panting hare , Refuge in the lynx 's lair , Love , Desire , Hope , and Fear , Ever will be near .</p>

    <p n="91">I would not be a king — enough Of woe it is to love ; The path to power is steep and rough , And tempests reign above . I would not climb the imperial throne ; 5 ‘ Tis built on ice which fortune 's sun Thaws in the height of noon . Then farewell , king , yet were I one , Care would not come so soon .

    <p n="93">[ Published by Mrs. Shelley , “ Posthumous Poems ” , 1824 , and dated ‘ Pisa , 1821 . ’ ]</p>
    <p n="94">Wild , pale , and wonder-stricken , even as one Who staggers forth into the air and sun From the dark chamber of a mortal fever , Bewildered , and incapable , and ever Fancying strange comments in her dizzy brain 5 Of usual shapes , till the familiar train Of objects and of persons passed like things Strange as a dreamer 's mad imaginings , Ginevra from the nuptial altar went ; The vows to which her lips had sworn assent 10 Rung in her brain still with a jarring din , Deafening the lost intelligence within .</p>
    <p n="95">And so she moved under the bridal veil , Which made the paleness of her cheek more pale , And deepened the faint crimson of her mouth , 15 And darkened her dark locks , as moonlight doth ,— And of the gold and jewels glittering there She scarce felt conscious ,— but the weary glare Lay like a chaos of unwelcome light , Vexing the sense with gorgeous undelight , 20 A moonbeam in the shadow of a cloud Was less heavenly fair — her face was bowed , And as she passed , the diamonds in her hair Were mirrored in the polished marble stair Which led from the cathedral to the street ; 25 And ever as she went her light fair feet Erased these images .</p>
    <p n="96">The bride-maidens who round her thronging came , Some with a sense of self-rebuke and shame , Envying the unenviable ; and others Making the joy which should have been another 's 30 Their own by gentle sympathy ; and some Sighing to think of an unhappy home : Some few admiring what can ever lure Maidens to leave the heaven serene and pure Of parents ’ smiles for life 's great cheat ; a thing 35 Bitter to taste , sweet in imagining .</p>
    <p n="97">But they are all dispersed — and , lo ! she stands Looking in idle grief on her white hands , Alone within the garden now her own ; 40 And through the sunny air , with jangling tone , The music of the merry marriage-bells , Killing the azure silence , sinks and swells ;— Absorbed like one within a dream who dreams That he is dreaming , until slumber seems 45 A mockery of itself — when suddenly Antonio stood before her , pale as she . With agony , with sorrow , and with pride , He lifted his wan eyes upon the bride , And said — ‘ Is this thy faith ? ’ and then as one 50 Whose sleeping face is stricken by the sun With light like a harsh voice , which bids him rise And look upon his day of life with eyes Which weep in vain that they can dream no more , Ginevra saw her lover , and forbore 55 To shriek or faint , and checked the stifling blood Rushing upon her heart , and unsubdued Said — ‘ Friend , if earthly violence or ill , Suspicion , doubt , or the tyrannic will Of parents , chance or custom , time or change , 60 Or circumstance , or terror , or revenge , Or wildered looks , or words , or evil speech , With all their stings and venom can impeach Our love ,— we love not :— if the grave which hides The victim from the tyrant , and divides 65 The cheek that whitens from the eyes that dart Imperious inquisition to the heart That is another 's , could dissever ours , We love not . ’ — ‘ What ! do not the silent hours Beckon thee to Gherardi 's bridal bed ? 70 Is not that ring ’ — a pledge , he would have said , Of broken vows , but she with patient look The golden circle from her finger took , And said — ‘ Accept this token of my faith , The pledge of vows to be absolved by death ; 75 And I am dead or shall be soon — my knell Will mix its music with that merry bell , Does it not sound as if they sweetly said “ We toll a corpse out of the marriage-bed ” ? The flowers upon my bridal chamber strewn 80 Will serve unfaded for my bier — so soon That even the dying violet will not die Before Ginevra . ’ The strong fantasy Had made her accents weaker and more weak , And quenched the crimson life upon her cheek , 85 And glazed her eyes , and spread an atmosphere Round her , which chilled the burning noon with fear , Making her but an image of the thought Which , like a prophet or a shadow , brought News of the terrors of the coming time . 90 Like an accuser branded with the crime He would have cast on a beloved friend , Whose dying eyes reproach not to the end The pale betrayer — he then with vain repentance Would share , he cannot now avert , the sentence — 95 Antonio stood and would have spoken , when The compound voice of women and of men Was heard approaching ; he retired , while she Was led amid the admiring company Back to the palace ,— and her maidens soon 100 Changed her attire for the afternoon , And left her at her own request to keep An hour of quiet rest :— like one asleep With open eyes and folded hands she lay , Pale in the light of the declining day . 105</p>
    <p n="98">Meanwhile the day sinks fast , the sun is set , And in the lighted hall the guests are met ; The beautiful looked lovelier in the light Of love , and admiration , and delight Reflected from a thousand hearts and eyes , 110 Kindling a momentary Paradise . This crowd is safer than the silent wood , Where love 's own doubts disturb the solitude ; On frozen hearts the fiery rain of wine Falls , and the dew of music more divine 115 Tempers the deep emotions of the time To spirits cradled in a sunny clime :— How many meet , who never yet have met , To part too soon , but never to forget . How many saw the beauty , power and wit 120 Of looks and words which ne'er enchanted yet ; But life 's familiar veil was now withdrawn , As the world leaps before an earthquake 's dawn , And unprophetic of the coming hours , The matin winds from the expanded flowers 125 Scatter their hoarded incense , and awaken The earth , until the dewy sleep is shaken From every living heart which it possesses , Through seas and winds , cities and wildernesses , As if the future and the past were all 130 Treasured i ’ the instant ;— so Gherardi 's hall Laughed in the mirth of its lord 's festival , Till some one asked — ‘ Where is the Bride ? ’ And then A bridesmaid went ,— and ere she came again A silence fell upon the guests — a pause 135 Of expectation , as when beauty awes All hearts with its approach , though unbeheld ; Then wonder , and then fear that wonder quelled ;— For whispers passed from mouth to ear which drew The colour from the hearer 's cheeks , and flew 140 Louder and swifter round the company ; And then Gherardi entered with an eye Of ostentatious trouble , and a crowd Surrounded him , and some were weeping loud .</p>
    <p n="99">They found Ginevra dead ! if it be death 145 To lie without motion , or pulse , or breath , With waxen cheeks , and limbs cold , stiff , and white , And open eyes , whose fixed and glassy light Mocked at the speculation they had owned . If it be death , when there is felt around 150 A smell of clay , a pale and icy glare , And silence , and a sense that lifts the hair From the scalp to the ankles , as it were Corruption from the spirit passing forth , And giving all it shrouded to the earth , 155 And leaving as swift lightning in its flight Ashes , and smoke , and darkness : in our night Of thought we know thus much of death ,— no more Than the unborn dream of our life before Their barks are wrecked on its inhospitable shore . 160 The marriage feast and its solemnity Was turned to funeral pomp — the company , With heavy hearts and looks , broke up ; nor they Who loved the dead went weeping on their way Alone , but sorrow mixed with sad surprise 165 Loosened the springs of pity in all eyes , On which that form , whose fate they weep in vain , Will never , thought they , kindle smiles again . The lamps which , half extinguished in their haste , Gleamed few and faint o'er the abandoned feast , 170 Showed as it were within the vaulted room A cloud of sorrow hanging , as if gloom Had passed out of men 's minds into the air . Some few yet stood around Gherardi there , Friends and relations of the dead ,— and he , 175 A loveless man , accepted torpidly The consolation that he wanted not ; Awe in the place of grief within him wrought . Their whispers made the solemn silence seem More still — some wept ,... 180 Some melted into tears without a sob , And some with hearts that might be heard to throb Leaned on the table and at intervals Shuddered to hear through the deserted halls And corridors the thrilling shrieks which came 185 Upon the breeze of night , that shook the flame Of every torch and taper as it swept From out the chamber where the women kept ;— Their tears fell on the dear companion cold Of pleasures now departed ; then was knolled 190 The bell of death , and soon the priests arrived , And finding Death their penitent had shrived , Returned like ravens from a corpse whereon A vulture has just feasted to the bone . And then the mourning women came .— 195</p>

    <p n="115">[ Published in part ( lines 1-61 , 88-118 ) by Mrs. Shelley , “ Posthumous Poems ” , 1824 ; revised and enlarged by Rossetti , “ Complete Poetical Works of P. B. S . ” , 1870 . ]</p>
    <p n="116">Our boat is asleep on Serchio 's stream , Its sails are folded like thoughts in a dream , The helm sways idly , hither and thither ; Dominic , the boatman , has brought the mast , And the oars , and the sails ; but ‘ tis sleeping fast , 5 Like a beast , unconscious of its tether .</p>
    <p n="117">The stars burnt out in the pale blue air , And the thin white moon lay withering there ; To tower , and cavern , and rift , and tree , The owl and the bat fled drowsily . 10 Day had kindled the dewy woods , And the rocks above and the stream below , And the vapours in their multitudes , And the Apennine 's shroud of summer snow , And clothed with light of aery gold 15 The mists in their eastern caves uprolled .</p>
    <p n="118">Day had awakened all things that be , The lark and the thrush and the swallow free , And the milkmaid 's song and the mower 's scythe And the matin-bell and the mountain bee : 20 Fireflies were quenched on the dewy corn , Glow-worms went out on the river 's brim , Like lamps which a student forgets to trim : The beetle forgot to wind his horn , The crickets were still in the meadow and hill : 25 Like a flock of rooks at a farmer 's gun Night 's dreams and terrors , every one , Fled from the brains which are their prey From the lamp 's death to the morning ray .</p>
    <p n="119">All rose to do the task He set to each , 30 Who shaped us to His ends and not our own ; The million rose to learn , and one to teach What none yet ever knew or can be known . And many rose Whose woe was such that fear became desire ;— 35 Melchior and Lionel were not among those ; They from the throng of men had stepped aside , And made their home under the green hill-side . It was that hill , whose intervening brow Screens Lucca from the Pisan 's envious eye , 40 Which the circumfluous plain waving below , Like a wide lake of green fertility , With streams and fields and marshes bare , Divides from the far Apennines — which lie Islanded in the immeasurable air . 45</p>
    <p n="120">‘ What think you , as she lies in her green cove , Our little sleeping boat is dreaming of ? ’ ‘ If morning dreams are true , why I should guess That she was dreaming of our idleness , And of the miles of watery way 50 We should have led her by this time of day . ’ -</p>
    <p n="121">‘ Never mind , ’ said Lionel , ‘ Give care to the winds , they can bear it well About yon poplar-tops ; and see The white clouds are driving merrily , 55 And the stars we miss this morn will light More willingly our return to-night .— How it whistles , Dominic 's long black hair ! List , my dear fellow ; the breeze blows fair : Hear how it sings into the air — ’ 60</p>
    <p n="122">— ‘ Of us and of our lazy motions , ’ Impatiently said Melchior , ‘ If I can guess a boat 's emotions ; And how we ought , two hours before , To have been the devil knows where . ’ 65 And then , in such transalpine Tuscan As would have killed a Della-Cruscan ,</p>
    <p n="123">...</p>
    <p n="124">So , Lionel according to his art Weaving his idle words , Melchior said : ‘ She dreams that we are not yet out of bed ; 70 We 'll put a soul into her , and a heart Which like a dove chased by a dove shall beat . ’</p>
    <p n="125">...</p>
    <p n="126">‘ Ay , heave the ballast overboard , And stow the eatables in the aft locker . ’ ‘ Would not this keg be best a little lowered ? ’ 75 ‘ No , now all 's right . ’ ‘ Those bottles of warm tea — ( Give me some straw ) — must be stowed tenderly ; Such as we used , in summer after six , To cram in greatcoat pockets , and to mix Hard eggs and radishes and rolls at Eton , 80 And , couched on stolen hay in those green harbours Farmers called gaps , and we schoolboys called arbours , Would feast till eight . ’</p>
    <p n="127">...</p>
    <p n="128">With a bottle in one hand , As if his very soul were at a stand 85 Lionel stood — when Melchior brought him steady :— ‘ Sit at the helm — fasten this sheet — all ready ! ’</p>
    <p n="129">The chain is loosed , the sails are spread , The living breath is fresh behind , As with dews and sunrise fed , 90 Comes the laughing morning wind ;— The sails are full , the boat makes head Against the Serchio 's torrent fierce , Then flags with intermitting course , And hangs upon the wave , and stems 95 The tempest of the ... Which fervid from its mountain source Shallow , smooth and strong doth come ,— Swift as fire , tempestuously It sweeps into the affrighted sea ; 100 In morning 's smile its eddies coil , Its billows sparkle , toss and boil , Torturing all its quiet light Into columns fierce and bright .</p>
    <p n="130">The Serchio , twisting forth 105 Between the marble barriers which it clove At Ripafratta , leads through the dread chasm The wave that died the death which lovers love , Living in what it sought ; as if this spasm Had not yet passed , the toppling mountains cling , 110 But the clear stream in full enthusiasm Pours itself on the plain , then wandering Down one clear path of effluence crystalline Sends its superfluous waves , that they may fling At Arno 's feet tribute of corn and wine ; Then , through the pestilential deserts wild Of tangled marsh and woods of stunted pine , It rushes to the Ocean .</p>

SHELLEY . My task becomes inexpressibly painful as the year draws near that which sealed our earthly fate , and each poem , and each event it records , has a real or mysterious connection with the fatal catastrophe . I feel that I am incapable of putting on paper the history of those times . The heart of the man , abhorred of the poet , who could ‘ peep and botanize Upon his mother 's grave , ’ does not appear to me more inexplicably framed than that of one who can dissect and probe past woes , and repeat to the public ear the groans drawn from them in the throes of their agony . The year 1821 was spent in Pisa , or at the Baths of San Giuliano . We were not , as our wont had been , alone ; friends had gathered round us . Nearly all are dead , and , when Memory recurs to the past , she wanders among tombs . The genius , with all his blighting errors and mighty powers ; the companion of Shelley 's ocean-wanderings , and the sharer of his fate , than whom no man ever existed more gentle , generous , and fearless ; and others , who found in Shelley 's society , and in his great knowledge and warm sympathy , delight , instruction , and solace ; have joined him beyond the grave . A few survive who have felt life a desert since he left it . What misfortune can equal death ? Change can convert every other into a blessing , or heal its sting — death alone has no cure . It shakes the foundations of the earth on which we tread ; it destroys its beauty ; it casts down our shelter ; it exposes us bare to desolation . When those we love have passed into eternity , ‘ life is the desert and the solitude ’ in which we are forced to linger — but never find comfort more . There is much in the “ Adonais ” which seems now more applicable to Shelley himself than to the young and gifted poet whom he mourned . The poetic view he takes of death , and the lofty scorn he displays towards his calumniators , are as a prophecy on his own destiny when received among immortal names , and the poisonous breath of critics has vanished into emptiness before the fame he inherits . Shelley 's favourite taste was boating ; when living near the Thames or by the Lake of Geneva , much of his life was spent on the water . On the shore of every lake or stream or sea near which he dwelt , he had a boat moored . He had latterly enjoyed this pleasure again . There are no pleasure-boats on the Arno ; and the shallowness of its waters ( except in winter-time , when the stream is too turbid and impetuous for boating ) rendered it difficult to get any skiff light enough to float . Shelley , however , overcame the difficulty ; he , together with a friend , contrived a boat such as the huntsmen carry about with them in the Maremma , to cross the sluggish but deep streams that intersect the forests ,— a boat of laths and pitched canvas . It held three persons ; and he was often seen on the Arno in it , to the horror of the Italians , who remonstrated on the danger , and could not understand how anyone could take pleasure in an exercise that risked life . ‘ Ma va per la vita ! ’ they exclaimed . I little thought how true their words would prove . He once ventured , with a friend , on the glassy sea of a calm day , down the Arno and round the coast to Leghorn , which , by keeping close in shore , was very practicable . They returned to Pisa by the canal , when , missing the direct cut , they got entangled among weeds , and the boat upset ; a wetting was all the harm done , except that the intense cold of his drenched clothes made Shelley faint . Once I went down with him to the mouth of the Arno , where the stream , then high and swift , met the tideless sea , and disturbed its sluggish waters . It was a waste and dreary scene ; the desert sand stretched into a point surrounded by waves that broke idly though perpetually around ; it was a scene very similar to Lido , of which he had said — ‘ I love all waste And solitary places ; where we taste The pleasure of believing what we see Is boundless , as we wish our souls to be : And such was this wide ocean , and this shore More barren than its billows . ’ Our little boat was of greater use , unaccompanied by any danger , when we removed to the Baths . Some friends lived at the village of Pugnano , four miles off , and we went to and fro to see them , in our boat , by the canal ; which , fed by the Serchio , was , though an artificial , a full and picturesque stream , making its way under verdant banks , sheltered by trees that dipped their boughs into the murmuring waters . By day , multitudes of Ephemera darted to and fro on the surface ; at night , the fireflies came out among the shrubs on the banks ; the cicale at noon-day kept up their hum ; the aziola cooed in the quiet evening . It was a pleasant summer , bright in all but Shelley 's health and inconstant spirits ; yet he enjoyed himself greatly , and became more and more attached to the part of the country were chance appeared to cast us . Sometimes he projected taking a farm situated on the height of one of the near hills , surrounded by chestnut and pine woods , and overlooking a wide extent of country : or settling still farther in the maritime Apennines , at Massa . Several of his slighter and unfinished poems were inspired by these scenes , and by the companions around us . It is the nature of that poetry , however , which overflows from the soul oftener to express sorrow and regret than joy ; for it is when oppressed by the weight of life , and away from those he loves , that the poet has recourse to the solace of expression in verse . Still , Shelley 's passion was the ocean ; and he wished that our summers , instead of being passed among the hills near Pisa , should be spent on the shores of the sea . It was very difficult to find a spot . We shrank from Naples from a fear that the heats would disagree with Percy : Leghorn had lost its only attraction , since our friends who had resided there were returned to England ; and , Monte Nero being the resort of many English , we did not wish to find ourselves in the midst of a colony of chance travellers . No one then thought it possible to reside at Via Reggio , which latterly has become a summer resort . The low lands and bad air of Maremma stretch the whole length of the western shores of the Mediterranean , till broken by the rocks and hills of Spezia . It was a vague idea , but Shelley suggested an excursion to Spezia , to see whether it would be feasible to spend a summer there . The beauty of the bay enchanted him . We saw no house to suit us ; but the notion took root , and many circumstances , enchained as by fatality , occurred to urge him to execute it . He looked forward this autumn with great pleasure to the prospect of a visit from Leigh Hunt . When Shelley visited Lord Byron at Ravenna , the latter had suggested his coming out , together with the plan of a periodical work in which they should all join . Shelley saw a prospect of good for the fortunes of his friend , and pleasure in his society ; and instantly exerted himself to have the plan executed . He did not intend himself joining in the work : partly from pride , not wishing to have the air of acquiring readers for his poetry by associating it with the compositions of more popular writers ; and also because he might feel shackled in the free expression of his opinions , if any friends were to be compromised . By those opinions , carried even to their outermost extent , he wished to live and die , as being in his conviction not only true , but such as alone would conduce to the moral improvement and happiness of mankind . The sale of the work might meanwhile , either really or supposedly , be injured by the free expression of his thoughts ; and this evil he resolved to avoid . POEMS WRITTEN IN 1822 . THE ZUCCA . [ Published by Mrs. Shelley , “ Posthumous Poems ” , 1824 , and dated ‘ January , 1822 . ’ There is a copy amongst the Boscombe manuscripts . ] 1 . Summer was dead and Autumn was expiring , And infant Winter laughed upon the land All cloudlessly and cold ;— when I , desiring More in this world than any understand , Wept o'er the beauty , which , like sea retiring , 5 Had left the earth bare as the wave-worn sand Of my lorn heart , and o'er the grass and flowers Pale for the falsehood of the flattering Hours . 2 . Summer was dead , but I yet lived to weep The instability of all but weeping ; 10 And on the Earth lulled in her winter sleep I woke , and envied her as she was sleeping . Too happy Earth ! over thy face shall creep The wakening vernal airs , until thou , leaping From unremembered dreams , shalt ... see 15 No death divide thy immortality . 3 . I loved — oh , no , I mean not one of ye , Or any earthly one , though ye are dear As human heart to human heart may be ;— I loved , I know not what — but this low sphere 20 And all that it contains , contains not thee , Thou , whom , seen nowhere , I feel everywhere . From Heaven and Earth , and all that in them are , Veiled art thou , like a ... star . 4 . By Heaven and Earth , from all whose shapes thou flowest , 25 Neither to be contained , delayed , nor hidden ; Making divine the loftiest and the lowest , When for a moment thou art not forbidden To live within the life which thou bestowest ; And leaving noblest things vacant and chidden , 30 Cold as a corpse after the spirit 's flight Blank as the sun after the birth of night . 5 . In winds , and trees , and streams , and all things common , In music and the sweet unconscious tone Of animals , and voices which are human , 35 Meant to express some feelings of their own ; In the soft motions and rare smile of woman , In flowers and leaves , and in the grass fresh-shown , Or dying in the autumn , I the most Adore thee present or lament thee lost . 40 6 . And thus I went lamenting , when I saw A plant upon the river 's margin lie Like one who loved beyond his nature 's law , And in despair had cast him down to die ; Its leaves , which had outlived the frost , the thaw 45 Had blighted ; like a heart which hatred 's eye Can blast not , but which pity kills ; the dew Lay on its spotted leaves like tears too true . 7 . The Heavens had wept upon it , but the Earth Had crushed it on her maternal breast 50 ... 8 . I bore it to my chamber , and I planted It in a vase full of the lightest mould ; The winter beams which out of Heaven slanted Fell through the window-panes , disrobed of cold , Upon its leaves and flowers ; the stars which panted 55 In evening for the Day , whose car has rolled Over the horizon 's wave , with looks of light Smiled on it from the threshold of the night . 9 . The mitigated influences of air And light revived the plant , and from it grew 60 Strong leaves and tendrils , and its flowers fair , Full as a cup with the vine 's burning dew , O'erflowed with golden colours ; an atmosphere Of vital warmth enfolded it anew , And every impulse sent to every part The unbeheld pulsations of its heart . 65 10 . Well might the plant grow beautiful and strong , Even if the air and sun had smiled not on it ; For one wept o'er it all the winter long Tears pure as Heaven 's rain , which fell upon it 70 Hour after hour ; for sounds of softest song Mixed with the stringed melodies that won it To leave the gentle lips on which it slept , Had loosed the heart of him who sat and wept . 11 . Had loosed his heart , and shook the leaves and flowers 75 On which he wept , the while the savage storm Waked by the darkest of December 's hours Was raving round the chamber hushed and warm ; The birds were shivering in their leafless bowers , The fish were frozen in the pools , the form 80 Of every summer plant was dead Whilst this .... ...</p>

    <p n="194">Ariel to Miranda :— Take This slave of Music , for the sake Of him who is the slave of thee , And teach it all the harmony In which thou canst , and only thou , 5 Make the delighted spirit glow , Till joy denies itself again , And , too intense , is turned to pain ; For by permission and command Of thine own Prince Ferdinand , 10 Poor Ariel sends this silent token Of more than ever can be spoken ; Your guardian spirit , Ariel , who , From life to life , must still pursue Your happiness ;— for thus alone 15 Can Ariel ever find his own . From Prospero 's enchanted cell , As the mighty verses tell , To the throne of Naples , he Lit you o'er the trackless sea , 20 Flitting on , your prow before , Like a living meteor . When you die , the silent Moon , In her interlunar swoon , Is not sadder in her cell Than deserted Ariel . When you live again on earth , Like an unseen star of birth , Ariel guides you o'er the sea Of life from your nativity . 30 Many changes have been run Since Ferdinand and you begun Your course of love , and Ariel still Has tracked your steps , and served your will ; Now , in humbler , happier lot , 35 This is all remembered not ; And now , alas ! the poor sprite is Imprisoned , for some fault of his , In a body like a grave ;— From you he only dares to crave , 40 For his service and his sorrow , A smile today , a song tomorrow .</p>
    <p n="195">The artist who this idol wrought , To echo all harmonious thought , Felled a tree , while on the steep 45 The woods were in their winter sleep , Rocked in that repose divine On the wind-swept Apennine ; And dreaming , some of Autumn past , And some of Spring approaching fast , 50 And some of April buds and showers , And some of songs in July bowers , And all of love ; and so this tree ,— O that such our death may be !— Died in sleep , and felt no pain , 55 To live in happier form again : From which , beneath Heaven 's fairest star , The artist wrought this loved Guitar , And taught it justly to reply , To all who question skilfully , 60 In language gentle as thine own ; Whispering in enamoured tone Sweet oracles of woods and dells , And summer winds in sylvan cells ; For it had learned all harmonies 65 Of the plains and of the skies , Of the forests and the mountains , And the many-voiced fountains ; The clearest echoes of the hills , The softest notes of falling rills , 70 The melodies of birds and bees , The murmuring of summer seas , And pattering rain , and breathing dew , And airs of evening ; and it knew That seldom-heard mysterious sound , 75 Which , driven on its diurnal round , As it floats through boundless day , Our world enkindles on its way .— All this it knows , but will not tell To those who cannot question well 80 The Spirit that inhabits it ; It talks according to the wit Of its companions ; and no more Is heard than has been felt before , By those who tempt it to betray 85 These secrets of an elder day : But , sweetly as its answers will Flatter hands of perfect skill , It keeps its highest , holiest tone For our beloved Jane alone . 90</p>

    <p n="203">She left me at the silent time When the moon had ceased to climb The azure path of Heaven 's steep , And like an albatross asleep , Balanced on her wings of light , 5 Hovered in the purple night , Ere she sought her ocean nest In the chambers of the West . She left me , and I stayed alone Thinking over every tone 10 Which , though silent to the ear , The enchanted heart could hear , Like notes which die when born , but still Haunt the echoes of the hill ; And feeling ever — oh , too much !— 15 The soft vibration of her touch , As if her gentle hand , even now , Lightly trembled on my brow ; And thus , although she absent were , Memory gave me all of her 20 That even Fancy dares to claim :— Her presence had made weak and tame All passions , and I lived alone In the time which is our own ; The past and future were forgot , 25 As they had been , and would be , not . But soon , the guardian angel gone , The daemon reassumed his throne In my faint heart . I dare not speak My thoughts , but thus disturbed and weak 30 I sat and saw the vessels glide Over the ocean bright and wide , Like spirit-winged chariots sent O'er some serenest element For ministrations strange and far ; 35 As if to some Elysian star Sailed for drink to medicine Such sweet and bitter pain as mine . And the wind that winged their flight From the land came fresh and light , 40 And the scent of winged flowers , And the coolness of the hours Of dew , and sweet warmth left by day , Were scattered o'er the twinkling bay . And the fisher with his lamp 45 And spear about the low rocks damp Crept , and struck the fish which came To worship the delusive flame .

    <p n="221">NOTE ON POEMS OF 1822 , BY MRS. SHELLEY .</p>
    <p n="222">This morn thy gallant bark Sailed on a sunny sea : ‘ Tis noon , and tempests dark Have wrecked it on the lee . Ah woe ! ah woe ! By Spirits of the deep Thou'rt cradled on the billow To thy eternal sleep .</p>
    <p n="223">Thou sleep'st upon the shore Beside the knelling surge , And Sea-nymphs evermore Shall sadly chant thy dirge . They come , they come , The Spirits of the deep ,— While near thy seaweed pillow My lonely watch I keep .</p>
    <p n="224">From far across the sea I hear a loud lament , By Echo 's voice for thee From Ocean 's caverns sent . O list ! O list ! The Spirits of the deep ! They raise a wail of sorrow , While I forever weep .</p>
    <p n="225">With this last year of the life of Shelley these Notes end . They are not what I intended them to be . I began with energy , and a burning desire to impart to the world , in worthy language , the sense I have of the virtues and genius of the beloved and the lost ; my strength has failed under the task . Recurrence to the past , full of its own deep and unforgotten joys and sorrows , contrasted with succeeding years of painful and solitary struggle , has shaken my health . Days of great suffering have followed my attempts to write , and these again produced a weakness and languor that spread their sinister influence over these notes . I dislike speaking of myself , but cannot help apologizing to the dead , and to the public , for not having executed in the manner I desired the history I engaged to give of Shelley 's writings . ( I at one time feared that the correction of the press might be less exact through my illness ; but I believe that it is nearly free from error . Some asterisks occur in a few pages , as they did in the volume of “ Posthumous Poems ” , either because they refer to private concerns , or because the original manuscript was left imperfect . Did any one see the papers from which I drew that volume , the wonder would be how any eyes or patience were capable of extracting it from so confused a mass , interlined and broken into fragments , so that the sense could only be deciphered and joined by guesses which might seem rather intuitive than founded on reasoning . Yet I believe no mistake was made . )</p>
    <p n="226">The winter of 1822 was passed in Pisa , if we might call that season winter in which autumn merged into spring after the interval of but few days of bleaker weather . Spring sprang up early , and with extreme beauty . Shelley had conceived the idea of writing a tragedy on the subject of Charles I . It was one that he believed adapted for a drama ; full of intense interest , contrasted character , and busy passion . He had recommended it long before , when he encouraged me to attempt a play . Whether the subject proved more difficult than he anticipated , or whether in fact he could not bend his mind away from the broodings and wanderings of thought , divested from human interest , which he best loved , I cannot tell ; but he proceeded slowly , and threw it aside for one of the most mystical of his poems , the “ Triumph of Life ” , on which he was employed at the last .</p>
    <p n="227">His passion for boating was fostered at this time by having among our friends several sailors . His favourite companion , Edward Ellerker Williams , of the 8th Light Dragoons , had begun his life in the navy , and had afterwards entered the army ; he had spent several years in India , and his love for adventure and manly exercises accorded with Shelley 's taste . It was their favourite plan to build a boat such as they could manage themselves , and , living on the sea-coast , to enjoy at every hour and season the pleasure they loved best . Captain Roberts , R. N ., undertook to build the boat at Genoa , where he was also occupied in building the “ Bolivar ” for Lord Byron . Ours was to be an open boat , on a model taken from one of the royal dockyards . I have since heard that there was a defect in this model , and that it was never seaworthy . In the month of February , Shelley and his friend went to Spezia to seek for houses for us . Only one was to be found at all suitable ; however , a trifle such as not finding a house could not stop Shelley ; the one found was to serve for all . It was unfurnished ; we sent our furniture by sea , and with a good deal of precipitation , arising from his impatience , made our removal . We left Pisa on the 26th of April .</p>
    <p n="228">The Bay of Spezia is of considerable extent , and divided by a rocky promontory into a larger and smaller one . The town of Lerici is situated on the eastern point , and in the depth of the smaller bay , which bears the name of this town , is the village of San Terenzo . Our house , Casa Magni , was close to this village ; the sea came up to the door , a steep hill sheltered it behind . The proprietor of the estate on which it was situated was insane ; he had begun to erect a large house at the summit of the hill behind , but his malady prevented its being finished , and it was falling into ruin . He had ( and this to the Italians had seemed a glaring symptom of very decided madness ) rooted up the olives on the hillside , and planted forest trees . These were mostly young , but the plantation was more in English taste than I ever elsewhere saw in Italy ; some fine walnut and ilex trees intermingled their dark massy foliage , and formed groups which still haunt my memory , as then they satiated the eye with a sense of loveliness . The scene was indeed of unimaginable beauty . The blue extent of waters , the almost landlocked bay , the near castle of Lerici shutting it in to the east , and distant Porto Venere to the west ; the varied forms of the precipitous rocks that bound in the beach , over which there was only a winding rugged footpath towards Lerici , and none on the other side ; the tideless sea leaving no sands nor shingle , formed a picture such as one sees in Salvator Rosa 's landscapes only . Sometimes the sunshine vanished when the sirocco raged — the ‘ ponente ’ the wind was called on that shore . The gales and squalls that hailed our first arrival surrounded the bay with foam ; the howling wind swept round our exposed house , and the sea roared unremittingly , so that we almost fancied ourselves on board ship . At other times sunshine and calm invested sea and sky , and the rich tints of Italian heaven bathed the scene in bright and ever-varying tints .</p>
    <p n="229">The natives were wilder than the place . Our near neighbours of San Terenzo were more like savages than any people I ever before lived among . Many a night they passed on the beach , singing , or rather howling ; the women dancing about among the waves that broke at their feet , the men leaning against the rocks and joining in their loud wild chorus . We could get no provisions nearer than Sarzana , at a distance of three miles and a half off , with the torrent of the Magra between ; and even there the supply was very deficient . Had we been wrecked on an island of the South Seas , we could scarcely have felt ourselves farther from civilisation and comfort ; but , where the sun shines , the latter becomes an unnecessary luxury , and we had enough society among ourselves . Yet I confess housekeeping became rather a toilsome task , especially as I was suffering in my health , and could not exert myself actively .</p>
    <p n="230">At first the fatal boat had not arrived , and was expected with great impatience . On Monday , 12th May , it came . Williams records the long-wished-for fact in his journal : ‘ Cloudy and threatening weather . M. Maglian called ; and after dinner , and while walking with him on the terrace , we discovered a strange sail coming round the point of Porto Venere , which proved at length to be Shelley 's boat . She had left Genoa on Thursday last , but had been driven back by the prevailing bad winds . A Mr. Heslop and two English seamen brought her round , and they speak most highly of her performances . She does indeed excite my surprise and admiration . Shelley and I walked to Lerici , and made a stretch off the land to try her : and I find she fetches whatever she looks at . In short , we have now a perfect plaything for the summer . ’ — It was thus that short-sighted mortals welcomed Death , he having disguised his grim form in a pleasing mask ! The time of the friends was now spent on the sea ; the weather became fine , and our whole party often passed the evenings on the water when the wind promised pleasant sailing . Shelley and Williams made longer excursions ; they sailed several times to Massa . They had engaged one of the seamen who brought her round , a boy , by name Charles Vivian ; and they had not the slightest apprehension of danger . When the weather was unfavourable , they employed themselves with alterations in the rigging , and by building a boat of canvas and reeds , as light as possible , to have on board the other for the convenience of landing in waters too shallow for the larger vessel . When Shelley was on board , he had his papers with him ; and much of the “ Triumph of Life ” was written as he sailed or weltered on that sea which was soon to engulf him .</p>
    <p n="231">The heats set in in the middle of June ; the days became excessively hot . But the sea-breeze cooled the air at noon , and extreme heat always put Shelley in spirits . A long drought had preceded the heat ; and prayers for rain were being put up in the churches , and processions of relics for the same effect took place in every town . At this time we received letters announcing the arrival of Leigh Hunt at Genoa . Shelley was very eager to see him . I was confined to my room by severe illness , and could not move ; it was agreed that Shelley and Williams should go to Leghorn in the boat . Strange that no fear of danger crossed our minds ! Living on the sea-shore , the ocean became as a plaything : as a child may sport with a lighted stick , till a spark inflames a forest , and spreads destruction over all , so did we fearlessly and blindly tamper with danger , and make a game of the terrors of the ocean . Our Italian neighbours , even , trusted themselves as far as Massa in the skiff ; and the running down the line of coast to Leghorn gave no more notion of peril than a fair-weather inland navigation would have done to those who had never seen the sea . Once , some months before , Trelawny had raised a warning voice as to the difference of our calm bay and the open sea beyond ; but Shelley and his friend , with their one sailor-boy , thought themselves a match for the storms of the Mediterranean , in a boat which they looked upon as equal to all it was put to do .</p>
    <p n="232">On the 1st of July they left us . If ever shadow of future ill darkened the present hour , such was over my mind when they went . During the whole of our stay at Lerici , an intense presentiment of coming evil brooded over my mind , and covered this beautiful place and genial summer with the shadow of coming misery . I had vainly struggled with these emotions — they seemed accounted for by my illness ; but at this hour of separation they recurred with renewed violence . I did not anticipate danger for them , but a vague expectation of evil shook me to agony , and I could scarcely bring myself to let them go . The day was calm and clear ; and , a fine breeze rising at twelve , they weighed for Leghorn . They made the run of about fifty miles in seven hours and a half . The “ Bolivar ” was in port ; and , the regulations of the Health-office not permitting them to go on shore after sunset , they borrowed cushions from the larger vessel , and slept on board their boat .</p>
    <p n="233">They spent a week at Pisa and Leghorn . The want of rain was severely felt in the country . The weather continued sultry and fine . I have heard that Shelley all this time was in brilliant spirits . Not long before , talking of presentiment , he had said the only one that he ever found infallible was the certain advent of some evil fortune when he felt peculiarly joyous . Yet , if ever fate whispered of coming disaster , such inaudible but not unfelt prognostics hovered around us . The beauty of the place seemed unearthly in its excess : the distance we were at from all signs of civilization , the sea at our feet , its murmurs or its roaring for ever in our ears ,— all these things led the mind to brood over strange thoughts , and , lifting it from everyday life , caused it to be familiar with the unreal . A sort of spell surrounded us ; and each day , as the voyagers did not return , we grew restless and disquieted , and yet , strange to say , we were not fearful of the most apparent danger .</p>
    <p n="234">The spell snapped ; it was all over ; an interval of agonizing doubt — of days passed in miserable journeys to gain tidings , of hopes that took firmer root even as they were more baseless — was changed to the certainty of the death that eclipsed all happiness for the survivors for evermore .</p>
    <p n="235">There was something in our fate peculiarly harrowing . The remains of those we lost were cast on shore ; but , by the quarantine-laws of the coast , we were not permitted to have possession of them — the law with respect to everything cast on land by the sea being that such should be burned , to prevent the possibility of any remnant bringing the plague into Italy ; and no representation could alter the law . At length , through the kind and unwearied exertions of Mr. Dawkins , our Charge d'Affaires at Florence , we gained permission to receive the ashes after the bodies were consumed . Nothing could equal the zeal of Trelawny in carrying our wishes into effect . He was indefatigable in his exertions , and full of forethought and sagacity in his arrangements . It was a fearful task ; he stood before us at last , his hands scorched and blistered by the flames of the funeral-pyre , and by touching the burnt relics as he placed them in the receptacles prepared for the purpose . And there , in compass of that small case , was gathered all that remained on earth of him whose genius and virtue were a crown of glory to the world — whose love had been the source of happiness , peace , and good ,— to be buried with him !</p>
    <p n="236">The concluding stanzas of the “ Adonais ” pointed out where the remains ought to be deposited ; in addition to which our beloved child lay buried in the cemetery at Rome . Thither Shelley 's ashes were conveyed ; and they rest beneath one of the antique weed-grown towers that recur at intervals in the circuit of the massy ancient wall of Rome . He selected the hallowed place himself ; there is</p>
    <p n="237">‘ the sepulchre , Oh , not of him , but of our joy !— ... And gray walls moulder round , on which dull Time Feeds , like slow fire upon a hoary brand ; And one keen pyramid with wedge sublime , Pavilioning the dust of him who planned This refuge for his memory , doth stand Like flame transformed to marble ; and beneath , A field is spread , on which a newer band Have pitched in Heaven 's smile their camp of death , Welcoming him we lose with scarce extinguished breath . ’</p>
    <p n="238">Could sorrow for the lost , and shuddering anguish at the vacancy left behind , be soothed by poetic imaginations , there was something in Shelley 's fate to mitigate pangs which yet , alas ! could not be so mitigated ; for hard reality brings too miserably home to the mourner all that is lost of happiness , all of lonely unsolaced struggle that remains . Still , though dreams and hues of poetry cannot blunt grief , it invests his fate with a sublime fitness , which those less nearly allied may regard with complacency . A year before he had poured into verse all such ideas about death as give it a glory of its own . He had , as it now seems , almost anticipated his own destiny ; and , when the mind figures his skiff wrapped from sight by the thunder-storm , as it was last seen upon the purple sea , and then , as the cloud of the tempest passed away , no sign remained of where it had been ( Captain Roberts watched the vessel with his glass from the top of the lighthouse of Leghorn , on its homeward track . They were off Via Reggio , at some distance from shore , when a storm was driven over the sea . It enveloped them and several larger vessels in darkness . When the cloud passed onwards , Roberts looked again , and saw every other vessel sailing on the ocean except their little schooner , which had vanished . From that time he could scarcely doubt the fatal truth ; yet we fancied that they might have been driven towards Elba or Corsica , and so be saved . The observation made as to the spot where the boat disappeared caused it to be found , through the exertions of Trelawny for that effect . It had gone down in ten fathom water ; it had not capsized , and , except such things as had floated from her , everything was found on board exactly as it had been placed when they sailed . The boat itself was uninjured . Roberts possessed himself of her , and decked her ; but she proved not seaworthy , and her shattered planks now lie rotting on the shore of one of the Ionian islands , on which she was wrecked . ) — who but will regard as a prophecy the last stanza of the “ Adonais ” ?</p>
    <p n="239">‘ The breath whose might I have invoked in song Descends on me ; my spirit 's bark is driven , Far from the shore , far from the trembling throng Whose sails were never to the tempest given ; The massy earth and sphered skies are riven ! I am borne darkly , fearfully , afar ; Whilst burning through the inmost veil of Heaven , The soul of Adonais , like a star , Beacons from the abode where the Eternal are . ’</p>
