    <head>ABOUT THE ELEGIES</head>
    <head>Goethe cultivated a special , italianate hand for this portfolio of twenty-four “ elegies , ” so called because he was emulating the elegiasts of Imperial Rome , Tibullus , Propertius , Catullus . The Elegies have never before been published as here , together in the cyclical form of their original conception . Experts even denied that the two priapeia ( I &amp; XXIV ) were by Goethe at all , although they are in the same hand as the rest . To be sure , these two are not numbered , so that I was long undecided as to just what their proper position might be . At one time I imagined they must belong at the middle of the cycle where at the end of Elegy XIII Priapus ’ mother summons her son . Obviously Goethe , just returned north from his two years in Italy ( 1786-88 ) , and alienated from prim , courtly friends ( especially since he had taken a girlfriend into his cottage ) , had no thought of publication when he indited these remembrances of Ancient Rome . But he did show them to close friends , one of whom was the wonderful dramatist Friedrich Schiller . In 1795 , Schiller undertook a new periodical , Die Horen . This thoughtful and responsible man initiated the journal with an essay of his own , explaining how forms of entertainment are actually at the same time our primary modes of education . It makes for pretty difficult reading in our present , less interested epoch . But he did break the essay up with diversions solicited from the best minds of his era . For a discussion of all this , see</head>
     <l n="1">Professor Worthy 's Page</l>
   </lg>
   <p>For now , it is enough to say that among Schiller 's examples for “ aesthetic education , ” as he called it , were these Elegies by his much admired friend , Wolfgang Goethe . Editor and author made substantial changes for propriety 's sake — despite Goethe 's having lashed out to the contrary in the first Elegy ( which he now suppressed , along with the final one ) . My attempt has been — for the very first time by the way , in any language — to restore Goethe 's cycle to his early conception . Since I have been unwilling to intrude with learned notes , I must apologize for Goethe 's many classical allusions , which were as familiar to his own readership as are , in our publications today , the dense references to media celebrities . Modern editors of what they call the “ Roman Elegies ” bring abundant annotation , and often detail Goethe 's own emendations . What I bring here is merely translated from his manuscript in the Goethe-Schiller Archive in Weimar .</p>
