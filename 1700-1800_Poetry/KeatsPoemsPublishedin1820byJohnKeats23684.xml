    <docTitle><titlePart>LIFE OF KEATS Of all the great poets of the early nineteenth century — Wordsworth , Coleridge , Scott , Byron , Shelley , Keats — John Keats was the last born and the first to die . The length of his life was not one-third that of Wordsworth , who was born twenty-five years before him and outlived him by twenty-nine . Yet before his tragic death at twenty-six Keats had produced a body of poetry of such extraordinary power and promise that the world has sometimes been tempted , in its regret for what he might have done had he lived , to lose sight of the superlative merit of what he actually accomplished . The three years of his poetic career , during which he published three small volumes of poetry , show a development at the same time rapid and steady , and a gradual but complete abandonment of almost every fault and weakness . It would probably be impossible , in the history of literature , to find such another instance of the ‘ growth of a poet 's mind ’ .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>The last of these three volumes , which is here reprinted , was published in<date>1820</date>, when it ‘ had good success among the literary people and . . . a moderate sale ’ . It contains the flower of his poetic production and is perhaps , altogether , one of the most marvellous volumes ever issued from the press . But in spite of the maturity of Keats 's work when he was twenty-five , he had been in no sense a precocious child . Born in<date>1795</date>in the city of<settlement>London</settlement>, the son of a livery-stable keeper , he was brought up amid surroundings and influences by no means calculated to awaken poetic genius . He was the eldest of five — four boys , one of whom died in infancy , and a girl younger than all ; and he and his brothers George and Tom were educated at a private school at Enfield . Here John was at first distinguished more for fighting than for study , whilst his bright , brave , generous nature made him popular with masters and boys . Soon after he had begun to go to school his father died , and when he was fifteen the children lost their mother too . Keats was passionately devoted to his mother ; during her last illness he would sit up all night with her , give her her medicine , and even cook her food himself . At her death he was brokenhearted . The children were now put under the care of two guardians , one of whom , Mr. Abbey , taking the sole responsibility , immediately removed John from school and apprenticed him for five years to a surgeon at Edmonton . Whilst thus employed Keats spent all his leisure time in reading , for which he had developed a great enthusiasm during his last two years at school . There he had devoured every book that came in his way , especially rejoicing in stories of the gods and goddesses of ancient Greece . At Edmonton he was able to continue his studies by borrowing books from his friend Charles Cowden Clarke , the son of his schoolmaster , and he often went over to Enfield to change his books and to discuss those which he had been reading . On one of these occasions Cowden Clarke introduced him to Spenser , to whom so many poets have owed their first inspiration that he has been called ‘ the poets ’ poet ’ ; and it was then , apparently , that Keats was first prompted to write . When he was nineteen , a year before his apprenticeship came to an end , he quarrelled with his master , left him , and continued his training in<settlement>London</settlement>as a student at St. Thomas 's Hospital and Guy 's . Gradually , however , during the months that followed , though he was an industrious and able medical student , Keats came to realize that poetry was his true vocation ; and as soon as he was of age , in spite of the opposition of his guardian , he decided to abandon the medical profession and devote his life to literature . If Mr. Abbey was unsympathetic Keats was not without encouragement from others . His brothers always believed in him whole-heartedly , and his exceptionally lovable nature had won him many friends . Amongst these friends two men older than himself , each famous in his own sphere , had special influence upon him . One of them , Leigh Hunt , was something of a poet himself and a pleasant prose-writer . His encouragement did much to stimulate Keats 's genius , but his direct influence on his poetry was wholly bad . Leigh Hunt 's was not a deep nature ; his poetry is often trivial and sentimental , and his easy conversational style is intolerable when applied to a great theme . To this man 's influence , as well as to the surroundings of his youth , are doubtless due the occasional flaws of taste in Keats 's early work . The other , Haydon , was an artist of mediocre creative talent but great aims and amazing belief in himself . He had a fine critical faculty which was shown in his appreciation of the Elgin marbles , in opposition to the most respected authorities of his day . Mainly through his insistence they were secured for the nation which thus owes him a boundless debt of gratitude . He helped to guide and direct Keats 's taste by his enthusiastic exposition of these masterpieces of Greek sculpture . In<date>1817</date>Keats published his first volume of poems , including ‘ Sleep and Poetry ’ and the well-known lines ‘ I stood tiptoe upon a little hill ’ . With much that is of the highest poetic value , many memorable lines and touches of his unique insight into nature , the volume yet showed considerable immaturity . It contained indeed , if we except one perfect sonnet , rather a series of experiments than any complete and finished work . There were abundant faults for those who liked to look for them , though there were abundant beauties too ; and the critics and the public chose rather to concentrate their attention on the former . The volume was therefore anything but a success ; but Keats was not discouraged , for he saw many of his own faults more clearly than did his critics , and felt his power to outgrow them . Immediately after this Keats went to the Isle of Wight and thence to Margate that he might study and write undisturbed . On May 10th he wrote to Haydon — ‘ I never quite despair , and I read Shakespeare — indeed I shall , I think , never read any other book much ’ . We have seen Keats influenced by Spenser and by Leigh Hunt : now , though his love for Spenser continued , Shakespeare 's had become the dominant influence . Gradually he came too under the influence of Wordsworth 's philosophy of poetry and life , and later his reading of Milton affected his style to some extent , but Shakespeare 's influence was the widest , deepest and most lasting , though it is the hardest to define . His study of other poets left traces upon his work in turns of phrase or turns of thought : Shakespeare permeated his whole being , and his influence is to be detected not in a resemblance of style , for Shakespeare can have no imitators , but in a broadening view of life , and increased humanity .</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>No poet could have owed his education more completely to the English poets than did John Keats . His knowledge of Latin was slight — he knew no Greek , and even the classical stories which he loved and constantly used , came to him almost entirely through the medium of Elizabethan translations and allusions . In this connexion it is interesting to read his first fine sonnet , in which he celebrates his introduction to the greatest of Greek poets in the translation of the rugged and forcible Elizabethan , George Chapman :— On first looking into Chapman 's Homer . Much have I travelled in the realms of gold , And many goodly states and kingdoms seen ; Round many western islands have I been Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold . Oft of one wide expanse had I been told That deep-brow 'd Homer ruled as his demesne ; Yet did I never breathe its pure serene Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold : Then felt I like some watcher of the skies When a new planet swims into his ken ; Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes He stared at the Pacific — and all his men Look 'd at each other with a wild surmise — Silent , upon a peak in Darien .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>Of the work upon which he was now engaged , the narrative-poem of Endymion , we may give his own account to his little sister Fanny in a letter dated September 10th ,<date>1817</date>:— ‘ Perhaps you might like to know what I am writing about . I will tell you . Many years ago there was a young handsome Shepherd who fed his flocks on a Mountain 's Side called Latmus — he was a very contemplative sort of a Person and lived solitary among the trees and Plains little thinking that such a beautiful Creature as the Moon was growing mad in Love with him .— However so it was ; and when he was asleep she used to come down from heaven and admire him excessively for a long time ; and at last could not refrain from carrying him away in her arms to the top of that high Mountain Latmus while he was a dreaming — but I dare say you have read this and all the other beautiful tales which have come down from the ancient times of that beautiful Greece . ’ On his return to<settlement>London</settlement>he and his brother Tom , always delicate and now quite an invalid , took lodgings at Hampstead . Here Keats remained for some time , harassed by the illness of his brother and of several of his friends ; and in June he was still further depressed by the departure of his brother George to try his luck in<country>America</country>. In April ,<date>1818</date>, Endymion was finished . Keats was by no means satisfied with it but preferred to publish it as it was , feeling it to be ‘ as good as I had power to make it by myself ’ .— ‘ I will write independently ’ he says to his publisher — ‘ I have written independently without judgment . I may write independently and with judgment hereafter . In Endymion I leaped headlong into the sea , and thereby have become better acquainted with the soundings , the quicksands , and the rocks , than if I had stayed upon the green shore , and piped a silly pipe , and took tea and comfortable advice . ’ He published it with a preface modestly explaining to the public his own sense of its imperfection . Nevertheless a storm of abuse broke upon him from the critics who fastened upon all the faults of the poem — the diffuseness of the story , its occasional sentimentality and the sometimes fantastic coinage of words , [ xiii : 1 ] and ignored the extraordinary beauties of which it is full . Directly after the publication of Endymion , and before the appearance of these reviews , Keats started with a friend , Charles Brown , for a walking tour in Scotland . They first visited the English lakes and thence walked to Dumfries , where they saw the house of Burns and his grave . They entered next the country of Meg Merrilies , and from Kirkcudbrightshire crossed over to Ireland for a few days . On their return they went north as far as Argyleshire , whence they sailed to Staffa and saw Fingal 's cave , which , Keats wrote , ‘ for solemnity and grandeur far surpasses the finest Cathedral . ’ They then crossed Scotland through Inverness , and Keats returned home by boat from Cromarty . His letters home are at first full of interest and enjoyment , but a ‘ slight sore throat ’ , contracted in ‘ a most wretched walk of thirty-seven miles across the Isle of Mull ’ , proved very troublesome and finally cut short his holiday . This was the beginning of the end . There was consumption in the family : Tom was dying of it ; and the cold , wet , and over-exertion of his Scotch tour seems to have developed the fatal tendency in Keats himself . From this time forward he was never well , and no good was done to either his health or spirits by the task which now awaited him of tending on his dying brother . For the last two or three months of<date>1818</date>, until Tom 's death in December , he scarcely left the bedside , and it was well for him that his friend , Charles Armitage Brown , was at hand to help and comfort him after the long strain . Brown persuaded Keats at once to leave the house , with its sad associations , and to come and live with him . Before long poetry absorbed Keats again ; and the first few months of<date>1819</date>were the most fruitful of his life . Besides working at Hyperion , which he had begun during Tom 's illness , he wrote The Eve of St. Agnes , The Eve of St. Mark , La Belle Dame Sans Merci , and nearly all his famous odes . Troubles however beset him . His friend Haydon was in difficulties and tormenting him , poor as he was , to lend him money ; the state of his throat gave serious cause for alarm ; and , above all , he was consumed by an unsatisfying passion for the daughter of a neighbour , Mrs. Brawne . She had rented Brown 's house whilst they were in Scotland , and had now moved to a street near by . Miss Fanny Brawne returned his love , but she seems never to have understood his nature or his needs . High-spirited and fond of pleasure she did not apparently allow the thought of her invalid lover to interfere much with her enjoyment of life . She would not , however , abandon her engagement , and she probably gave him all which it was in her nature to give . Ill-health made him , on the other hand , morbidly dissatisfied and suspicious ; and , as a result of his illness and her limitations , his love throughout brought him restlessness and torment rather than peace and comfort . Towards the end of July he went to Shanklin and there , in collaboration with Brown , wrote a play , Otho the Great . Brown tells us how they used to sit , one on either side of a table , he sketching out the scenes and handing each one , as the outline was finished , to Keats to write . As Keats never knew what was coming it was quite impossible that the characters should be adequately conceived , or that the drama should be a united whole . Nevertheless there is much that is beautiful and promising in it . It should not be forgotten that Keats 's ‘ greatest ambition ’ was , in his own words , ‘ the writing of a few fine plays ’ ; and , with the increasing humanity and grasp which his poetry shows , there is no reason to suppose that , had he lived , he would not have fulfilled it . At Shanklin , moreover , he had begun to write Lamia , and he continued it at Winchester . Here he stayed until the middle of October , excepting a few days which he spent in<settlement>London</settlement>to arrange about the sending of some money to his brother in<country>America</country>. George had been unsuccessful in his commercial enterprises , and Keats , in view of his family 's ill-success , determined temporarily to abandon poetry , and by reviewing or journalism to support himself and earn money to help his brother . Then , when he could afford it , he would return to poetry . Accordingly he came back to<settlement>London</settlement>, but his health was breaking down , and with it his resolution . He tried to re-write Hyperion , which he felt had been written too much under the influence of Milton and in ‘ the artist 's humour ’ . The same independence of spirit which he had shown in the publication of Endymion urged him now to abandon a work the style of which he did not feel to be absolutely his own . The re-cast he wrote in the form of a vision , calling it The Fall of Hyperion , and in so doing he added much to his conception of the meaning of the story . In no poem does he show more of the profoundly philosophic spirit which characterizes many of his letters . But it was too late ; his power was failing and , in spite of the beauty and interest of some of his additions , the alterations are mostly for the worse . Whilst The Fall of Hyperion occupied his evenings his mornings were spent over a satirical fairy-poem , The Cap and Bells , in the metre of the Faerie Queene . This metre , however , was ill-suited to the subject ; satire was not natural to him , and the poem has little intrinsic merit . Neither this nor the re-cast of Hyperion was finished when , in February ,<date>1820</date>, he had an attack of illness in which the first definite symptom of consumption appeared . Brown tells how he came home on the evening of Thursday , February 3rd , in a state of high fever , chilled from having ridden outside the coach on a bitterly cold day . ‘ He mildly and instantly yielded to my request that he should go to bed . . . On entering the cold sheets , before his head was on the pillow , he slightly coughed , and I heard him say — “ that is blood from my mouth ” . I went towards him : he was examining a single drop of blood upon the sheet . “ Bring me the candle , Brown , and let me see this blood . ” After regarding it steadfastly he looked up in my face with a calmness of expression that I can never forget , and said , “ I know the colour of that blood ;— it is arterial blood ; I cannot be deceived in that colour ; that drop of blood is my death warrant ;— I must die . " ’ He lived for another year , but it was one long dying : he himself called it his ‘ posthumous life ’ . Keats was one of the most charming of letter-writers . He had that rare quality of entering sympathetically into the mind of the friend to whom he was writing , so that his letters reveal to us much of the character of the recipient as well as of the writer . In the long journal-letters which he wrote to his brother and sister-in-law in<country>America</country>he is probably most fully himself , for there he is with the people who knew him best and on whose understanding and sympathy he could rely . But in none is the beauty of his character more fully revealed than in those to his little sister Fanny , now seventeen years old , and living with their guardian , Mr. Abbey . He had always been very anxious that they should ‘ become intimately acquainted , in order ’ , as he says , ‘ that I may not only , as you grow up , love you as my only Sister , but confide in you as my dearest friend . ’ In his most harassing times he continued to write to her , directing her reading , sympathizing in her childish troubles , and constantly thinking of little presents to please her . Her health was to him a matter of paramount concern , and in his last letters to her we find him reiterating warnings to take care of herself — ‘ You must be careful always to wear warm clothing not only in Frost but in a Thaw . ’ — ‘ Be careful to let no fretting injure your health as I have suffered it — health is the greatest of blessings — with health and hope we should be content to live , and so you will find as you grow older . ’ The constant recurrence of this thought becomes , in the light of his own sufferings , almost unbearably pathetic . During the first months of his illness Keats saw through the press his last volume of poetry , of which this is a reprint . The praise which it received from reviewers and public was in marked contrast to the scornful reception of his earlier works , and would have augured well for the future . But Keats was past caring much for poetic fame . He dragged on through the summer , with rallies and relapses , tormented above all by the thought that death would separate him from the woman he loved . Only Brown , of all his friends , knew what he was suffering , and it seems that he only knew fully after they were parted . The doctors warned Keats that a winter in<country>England</country>would kill him , so in September ,<date>1820</date>, he left<settlement>London</settlement>for Naples , accompanied by a young artist , Joseph Severn , one of his many devoted friends . Shelley , who knew him slightly , invited him to stay at Pisa , but Keats refused . He had never cared for Shelley , though Shelley seems to have liked him , and , in his invalid state , he naturally shrank from being a burden to a mere acquaintance . It was as they left<country>England</country>, off the coast of Dorsetshire , that Keats wrote his last beautiful sonnet on a blank leaf of his folio copy of Shakespeare , facing A Lover 's Complaint :— Bright star ! would I were steadfast as thou art — Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night , And watching , with eternal lids apart , Like Nature 's patient , sleepless Eremite , The moving waters at their priest-like task Of pure ablution round earth 's human shores , Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask Of snow upon the mountains and the moors — No — yet still steadfast , still unchangeable , Pillow 'd upon my fair love 's ripening breast , To feel for ever its soft fall and swell , Awake for ever in a sweet unrest , Still , still to hear her tender taken breath , And so live ever — or else swoon to death . The friends reached Rome , and there Keats , after a brief rally , rapidly became worse . Severn nursed him with desperate devotion , and of Keats 's sweet considerateness and patience he could never say enough . Indeed such was the force and lovableness of Keats 's personality that though Severn lived fifty-eight years longer it was for the rest of his life a chief occupation to write and draw his memories of his friend . On February 23rd ,<date>1821</date>, came the end for which Keats had begun to long . He died peacefully in Severn 's arms . On the 26th he was buried in the beautiful little Protestant cemetery of which Shelley said that it ‘ made one in love with death to think that one should be buried in so sweet a place ’ . Great indignation was felt at the time by those who attributed his death , in part at least , to the cruel treatment which he had received from the critics . Shelley , in Adonais , withered them with his scorn , and Byron , in Don Juan , had his gibe both at the poet and at his enemies . But we know now how mistaken they were . Keats , in a normal state of mind and body , was never unduly depressed by harsh or unfair criticism . ‘ Praise or blame , ’ he wrote , ‘ has but a momentary effect on the man whose love of beauty in the abstract makes him a severe critic on his own works , ’ and this attitude he consistently maintained throughout his poetic career . No doubt the sense that his genius was unappreciated added something to the torment of mind which he suffered in Rome , and on his death-bed he asked that on his tombstone should be inscribed the words ‘ Here lies one whose name was writ in water ’ . But it was apparently not said in bitterness , and the rest of the inscription [ xxiii : 1 ] expresses rather the natural anger of his friends at the treatment he had received than the mental attitude of the poet himself . Fully to understand him we must read his poetry with the commentary of his letters which reveal in his character elements of humour , clear-sighted wisdom , frankness , strength , sympathy and tolerance . So doing we shall enter into the mind and heart of the friend who , speaking for many , described Keats as one ‘ whose genius I did not , and do not , more fully admire than I entirely loved the man ’ .

     <l n="13">Into a forest on the shores of Crete .</l>
     <l n="14">For somewhere in that sacred island dwelt</l>
     <l n="15">A nymph , to whom all hoofed Satyrs knelt ;</l>
     <l n="16">At whose white feet the languid Tritons poured</l>
     <l n="17">Pearls , while on land they wither 'd and adored .</l>
     <l n="18">Fast by the springs where she to bathe was wont ,</l>
     <l n="19">And in those meads where sometime she might haunt ,</l>
     <l n="20">Were strewn rich gifts , unknown to any Muse ,</l>
     <l n="21">Though Fancy 's casket were unlock 'd to choose . 20</l>
     <l n="22">Ah , what a world of love was at her feet !</l>
     <l n="23">So Hermes thought , and a celestial heat</l>
     <l n="24">Burnt from his winged heels to either ear ,</l>
     <l n="25">That from a whiteness , as the lily clear ,</l>
     <l n="26">Blush 'd into roses ‘ mid his golden hair ,</l>
     <l n="27">Fallen in jealous curls about his shoulders bare .</l>
     <l n="28">From vale to vale , from wood to wood , he flew ,</l>
     <l n="29">Breathing upon the flowers his passion new ,</l>
     <l n="30">And wound with many a river to its head ,</l>
     <l n="31">To find where this sweet nymph prepar 'd her secret bed : 30</l>
     <l n="32">In vain ; the sweet nymph might nowhere be found ,</l>
     <l n="33">And so he rested , on the lonely ground ,</l>
     <l n="34">Pensive , and full of painful jealousies</l>
     <l n="35">Of the Wood-Gods , and even the very trees .</l>
     <l n="36">There as he stood , he heard a mournful voice ,</l>
     <l n="37">Such as once heard , in gentle heart , destroys</l>
     <l n="38">All pain but pity : thus the lone voice spake :</l>
     <l n="39">“ When from this wreathed tomb shall I awake !</l>
     <l n="40">When move in a sweet body fit for life ,</l>
     <l n="41">And love , and pleasure , and the ruddy strife 40</l>
     <l n="42">Of hearts and lips ! Ah , miserable me ! ”</l>
     <l n="43">The God , dove-footed , glided silently</l>
     <l n="44">Round bush and tree , soft-brushing , in his speed ,</l>
     <l n="45">The taller grasses and full-flowering weed ,</l>
     <l n="46">Until he found a palpitating snake ,</l>
     <l n="47">Bright , and cirque-couchant in a dusky brake .</l>

     <l n="130">One warm , flush 'd moment , hovering , it might seem</l>
     <l n="131">Dash 'd by the wood-nymph 's beauty , so he burn 'd ; 130</l>

     <l n="302">fires . 300</l>
     <l n="303">And then she whisper 'd in such trembling tone ,</l>
     <l n="304">As those who , safe together met alone</l>
     <l n="305">For the first time through many anguish 'd days ,</l>
     <l n="306">Use other speech than looks ; bidding him raise</l>
     <l n="307">His drooping head , and clear his soul of doubt ,</l>
     <l n="308">For that she was a woman , and without</l>
     <l n="309">Any more subtle fluid in her veins</l>
     <l n="310">Than throbbing blood , and that the self-same pains</l>
     <l n="311">Inhabited her frail-strung heart as his .</l>
     <l n="312">And next she wonder 'd how his eyes could miss 310</l>
     <l n="313">Her face so long in Corinth , where , she said ,</l>
     <l n="314">She dwelt but half retir 'd , and there had led</l>
     <l n="315">Days happy as the gold coin could invent</l>
     <l n="316">Without the aid of love ; yet in content</l>
     <l n="317">Till she saw him , as once she pass 'd him by ,</l>

     <l n="324">Lycius from death awoke into amaze ,</l>
     <l n="325">To see her still , and singing so sweet lays ;</l>

     <l n="327">To hear her whisper woman 's lore so well ;</l>
     <l n="328">And every word she spake entic 'd him on</l>
     <l n="329">To unperplex 'd delight and pleasure known .</l>
     <l n="330">Let the mad poets say whate'er they please</l>

     <l n="337">That Lycius could not love in half a fright ,</l>
     <l n="338">So threw the goddess off , and won his heart</l>
     <l n="339">More pleasantly by playing woman 's part ,</l>
     <l n="340">With no more awe than what her beauty gave ,</l>
     <l n="341">That , while it smote , still guaranteed to save .</l>
     <l n="342">Lycius to all made eloquent reply , 340</l>
     <l n="343">Marrying to every word a twinborn sigh ;</l>
     <l n="344">And last , pointing to Corinth , ask 'd her sweet ,</l>

      <l n="702">Motion 'd him to be silent ; vainly so ,</l>
      <l n="703">He look 'd and look 'd again a level — No !</l>
      <l n="704">“ A Serpent ! ” echoed he ; no sooner said ,</l>
      <l n="705">Than with a frightful scream she vanished :</l>
      <l n="706">And Lycius ’ arms were empty of delight ,</l>
      <l n="707">As were his limbs of life , from that same night .</l>
      <l n="708">On the high couch he lay !— his friends came round —</l>

    <head>[ 45 : A ] “ Philostratus , in his fourth book de Vita Apollonii , hath a memorable instance in this kind , which I may not omit , of one Menippus Lycius , a young man twenty-five years of age , that going betwixt Cenchreas and Corinth , met such a phantasm in the habit of a fair gentlewoman , which taking him by the hand , carried him home to her house , in the suburbs of Corinth , and told him she was a Phoenician by birth , and if he would tarry with her , he should hear her sing and play , and drink such wine as never any drank , and no man should molest him ; but she , being fair and lovely , would live and die with him , that was fair and lovely to behold . The young man , a philosopher , otherwise staid and discreet , able to moderate his passions , though not this of love , tarried with her a while to his great content , and at last married her , to whose wedding , amongst other guests , came Apollonius ; who , by some probable conjectures , found her out to be a serpent , a lamia ; and that all her furniture was , like Tantalus ’ gold , described by Homer , no substance but mere illusions . When she saw herself descried , she wept , and desired Apollonius to be silent , but he would not be moved , and thereupon she , plate , house , and all that was in it , vanished in an instant : many thousands took notice of this fact , for it was done in the midst of Greece . ”</head>

     <l n="220">And diamond-paved lustrous long arcades , 220</l>
     <l n="221">Until he reach 'd the great main cupola ;</l>
     <l n="222">There standing fierce beneath , he stampt his foot ,</l>
     <l n="223">And from the basements deep to the high towers</l>
     <l n="224">Jarr 'd his own golden region ; and before</l>
     <l n="225">The quavering thunder thereupon had ceas 'd ,</l>
     <l n="226">His voice leapt out , despite of godlike curb ,</l>
     <l n="227">To this result : “ O dreams of day and night !</l>
     <l n="228">O monstrous forms ! O effigies of pain !</l>
     <l n="229">O spectres busy in a cold , cold gloom !</l>
     <l n="230">O lank-eared Phantoms of black-weeded pools ! 230</l>
     <l n="231">Why do I know ye ? why have I seen ye ? why</l>
     <l n="232">Is my eternal essence thus distraught</l>
     <l n="233">To see and to behold these horrors new ?</l>
     <l n="234">Saturn is fallen , am I too to fall ?</l>
     <l n="235">Am I to leave this haven of my rest ,</l>
     <l n="236">This cradle of my glory , this soft clime ,</l>
     <l n="237">This calm luxuriance of blissful light ,</l>
     <l n="238">These crystalline pavilions , and pure fanes ,</l>
     <l n="239">Of all my lucent empire ? It is left</l>
     <l n="240">Deserted , void , nor any haunt of mine . 240</l>
     <l n="241">The blaze , the splendor , and the symmetry ,</l>
     <l n="242">I cannot see — but darkness , death and darkness .</l>
     <l n="243">Even here , into my centre of repose ,</l>
     <l n="244">The shady visions come to domineer ,</l>
     <l n="245">Insult , and blind , and stifle up my pomp .—</l>
     <l n="246">Fall !— No , by Tellus and her briny robes !</l>
     <l n="247">Over the fiery frontier of my realms</l>
     <l n="248">I will advance a terrible right arm</l>
     <l n="249">Shall scare that infant thunderer , rebel Jove ,</l>
     <l n="250">And bid old Saturn take his throne again . ” — 250</l>
     <l n="251">He spake , and ceas 'd , the while a heavier threat</l>
     <l n="252">Held struggle with his throat but came not forth ;</l>
     <l n="253">For as in theatres of crowded men</l>
     <l n="254">Hubbub increases more they call out “ Hush ! ”</l>
     <l n="255">So at Hyperion 's words the Phantoms pale</l>
     <l n="256">Bestirr 'd themselves , thrice horrible and cold ;</l>
     <l n="257">And from the mirror 'd level where he stood</l>
     <l n="258">A mist arose , as from a scummy marsh .</l>
     <l n="259">At this , through all his bulk an agony</l>
     <l n="260">Crept gradual , from the feet unto the crown , 260</l>
     <l n="261">Like a lithe serpent vast and muscular</l>
     <l n="262">Making slow way , with head and neck convuls 'd</l>
     <l n="263">From over-strained might . Releas 'd , he fled</l>
     <l n="264">To the eastern gates , and full six dewy hours</l>
     <l n="265">Before the dawn in season due should blush ,</l>
     <l n="266">He breath 'd fierce breath against the sleepy portals ,</l>
     <l n="267">Clear 'd them of heavy vapours , burst them wide</l>
     <l n="268">Suddenly on the ocean 's chilly streams .</l>
     <l n="269">The planet orb of fire , whereon he rode</l>
     <l n="270">Each day from east to west the heavens through , 270</l>
     <l n="271">Spun round in sable curtaining of clouds ;</l>
     <l n="272">Not therefore veiled quite , blindfold , and hid ,</l>
     <l n="273">But ever and anon the glancing spheres ,</l>
     <l n="274">Circles , and arcs , and broad-belting colure ,</l>
     <l n="275">Glow 'd through , and wrought upon the muffling dark</l>
     <l n="276">Sweet-shaped lightnings from the nadir deep</l>
     <l n="277">Up to the zenith ,— hieroglyphics old ,</l>
     <l n="278">Which sages and keen-eyed astrologers</l>
     <l n="279">Then living on the earth , with labouring thought</l>
     <l n="280">Won from the gaze of many centuries : 280</l>
     <l n="281">Now lost , save what we find on remnants huge</l>
     <l n="282">Of stone , or marble swart ; their import gone ,</l>
     <l n="283">Their wisdom long since fled .— Two wings this orb</l>
     <l n="284">Possess 'd for glory , two fair argent wings ,</l>
     <l n="285">Ever exalted at the God 's approach :</l>
     <l n="286">And now , from forth the gloom their plumes immense</l>
     <l n="287">Rose , one by one , till all outspreaded were ;</l>
     <l n="288">While still the dazzling globe maintain 'd eclipse ,</l>
     <l n="289">Awaiting for Hyperion 's command .</l>
     <l n="290">Fain would he have commanded , fain took throne 290</l>
     <l n="291">And bid the day begin , if but for change .</l>
     <l n="292">He might not :— No , though a primeval God :</l>
     <l n="293">The sacred seasons might not be disturb 'd .</l>
     <l n="294">Therefore the operations of the dawn</l>
     <l n="295">Stay 'd in their birth , even as here ‘ tis told .</l>
     <l n="296">Those silver wings expanded sisterly ,</l>
     <l n="297">Eager to sail their orb ; the porches wide</l>
     <l n="298">Open 'd upon the dusk demesnes of night</l>
     <l n="299">And the bright Titan , phrenzied with new woes ,</l>
     <l n="300">Unus 'd to bend , by hard compulsion bent 300</l>
     <l n="301">His spirit to the sorrow of the time ;</l>
     <l n="302">And all along a dismal rack of clouds ,</l>
     <l n="303">Upon the boundaries of day and night ,</l>
     <l n="304">He stretch 'd himself in grief and radiance faint .</l>
     <l n="305">There as he lay , the Heaven with its stars</l>
     <l n="306">Look 'd down on him with pity , and the voice</l>
     <l n="307">Of Coelus , from the universal space ,</l>
     <l n="308">Thus whisper 'd low and solemn in his ear .</l>
     <l n="309">“ O brightest of my children dear , earth-born</l>
     <l n="310">And sky-engendered , Son of Mysteries 310</l>
     <l n="311">All unrevealed even to the powers</l>
     <l n="312">Which met at thy creating ; at whose joys</l>
     <l n="313">And palpitations sweet , and pleasures soft ,</l>
     <l n="314">I , Coelus , wonder , how they came and whence ;</l>
     <l n="315">And at the fruits thereof what shapes they be ,</l>
     <l n="316">Distinct , and visible ; symbols divine ,</l>
     <l n="317">Manifestations of that beauteous life</l>
     <l n="318">Diffus 'd unseen throughout eternal space :</l>
     <l n="319">Of these new-form 'd art thou , oh brightest child !</l>
     <l n="320">Of these , thy brethren and the Goddesses ! 320</l>
     <l n="321">There is sad feud among ye , and rebellion</l>
     <l n="322">Of son against his sire . I saw him fall ,</l>
     <l n="323">I saw my first-born tumbled from his throne !</l>
     <l n="324">To me his arms were spread , to me his voice</l>
     <l n="325">Found way from forth the thunders round his head !</l>
     <l n="326">Pale wox I , and in vapours hid my face .</l>
     <l n="327">Art thou , too , near such doom ? vague fear there is :</l>
     <l n="328">For I have seen my sons most unlike Gods .</l>
     <l n="329">Divine ye were created , and divine</l>
     <l n="330">In sad demeanour , solemn , undisturb 'd , 330</l>
     <l n="331">Unruffled , like high Gods , ye liv 'd and ruled :</l>
     <l n="332">Now I behold in you fear , hope , and wrath ;</l>
     <l n="333">Actions of rage and passion ; even as</l>
     <l n="334">I see them , on the mortal world beneath ,</l>
     <l n="335">In men who die .— This is the grief , O Son !</l>
     <l n="336">Sad sign of ruin , sudden dismay , and fall !</l>
     <l n="337">Yet do thou strive ; as thou art capable ,</l>
     <l n="338">As thou canst move about , an evident God ;</l>
     <l n="339">And canst oppose to each malignant hour</l>
     <l n="340">Ethereal presence :— I am but a voice ; 340</l>
     <l n="341">My life is but the life of winds and tides ,</l>
     <l n="342">No more than winds and tides can I avail :—</l>
     <l n="343">But thou canst .— Be thou therefore in the van</l>
     <l n="344">Of circumstance ; yea , seize the arrow 's barb</l>
     <l n="345">Before the tense string murmur .— To the earth !</l>
     <l n="346">For there thou wilt find Saturn , and his woes .</l>
     <l n="347">Meantime I will keep watch on thy bright sun ,</l>
     <l n="348">And of thy seasons be a careful nurse . ” —</l>
     <l n="349">Ere half this region-whisper had come down ,</l>
     <l n="350">Hyperion arose , and on the stars 350</l>
     <l n="351">Lifted his curved lids , and kept them wide</l>
     <l n="352">Until it ceas 'd ; and still he kept them wide :</l>
     <l n="353">And still they were the same bright , patient stars .</l>
     <l n="354">Then with a slow incline of his broad breast ,</l>
     <l n="355">Like to a diver in the pearly seas ,</l>
     <l n="356">Forward he stoop 'd over the airy shore ,</l>
     <l n="357">And plung 'd all noiseless into the deep night .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Just at the self-same beat of Time 's wide wings</l>
     <l n="2">Hyperion slid into the rustled air ,</l>
     <l n="3">And Saturn gain 'd with Thea that sad place</l>
     <l n="4">Where Cybele and the bruised Titans mourn 'd .</l>
     <l n="5">It was a den where no insulting light</l>
     <l n="6">Could glimmer on their tears ; where their own groans</l>
     <l n="7">They felt , but heard not , for the solid roar</l>
     <l n="8">Of thunderous waterfalls and torrents hoarse ,</l>
     <l n="9">Pouring a constant bulk , uncertain where .</l>
     <l n="10">Crag jutting forth to crag , and rocks that seem 'd 10</l>
     <l n="11">Ever as if just rising from a sleep ,</l>
     <l n="12">Forehead to forehead held their monstrous horns ;</l>
     <l n="13">And thus in thousand hugest phantasies</l>
     <l n="14">Made a fit roofing to this nest of woe .</l>
     <l n="15">Instead of thrones , hard flint they sat upon ,</l>
     <l n="16">Couches of rugged stone , and slaty ridge</l>
     <l n="17">Stubborn 'd with iron . All were not assembled :</l>
     <l n="18">Some chain 'd in torture , and some wandering .</l>
     <l n="19">Coeus , and Gyges , and Briareüs ,</l>
     <l n="20">Typhon , and Dolor , and Porphyrion , 20</l>
     <l n="21">With many more , the brawniest in assault ,</l>
     <l n="22">Were pent in regions of laborious breath ;</l>
     <l n="23">Dungeon 'd in opaque element , to keep</l>
     <l n="24">Their clenched teeth still clench 'd , and all their limbs</l>
     <l n="25">Lock 'd up like veins of metal , crampt and screw 'd ;</l>
     <l n="26">Without a motion , save of their big hearts</l>
     <l n="27">Heaving in pain , and horribly convuls 'd</l>
     <l n="28">With sanguine feverous boiling gurge of pulse .</l>
     <l n="29">Mnemosyne was straying in the world ;</l>
     <l n="30">Far from her moon had Phoebe wandered ; 30</l>
     <l n="31">And many else were free to roam abroad ,</l>
     <l n="32">But for the main , here found they covert drear .</l>
     <l n="33">Scarce images of life , one here , one there ,</l>
     <l n="34">Lay vast and edgeways ; like a dismal cirque</l>
     <l n="35">Of Druid stones , upon a forlorn moor ,</l>
     <l n="36">When the chill rain begins at shut of eve ,</l>
     <l n="37">In dull November , and their chancel vault ,</l>
     <l n="38">The Heaven itself , is blinded throughout night .</l>
     <l n="39">Each one kept shroud , nor to his neighbour gave</l>
     <l n="40">Or word , or look , or action of despair . 40</l>
     <l n="41">Creüs was one ; his ponderous iron mace</l>
     <l n="42">Lay by him , and a shatter 'd rib of rock</l>
     <l n="43">Told of his rage , ere he thus sank and pined .</l>
     <l n="44">Iäpetus another ; in his grasp ,</l>
     <l n="45">A serpent 's plashy neck ; its barbed tongue</l>
     <l n="46">Squeez 'd from the gorge , and all its uncurl 'd length</l>
     <l n="47">Dead ; and because the creature could not spit</l>
     <l n="48">Its poison in the eyes of conquering Jove .</l>
     <l n="49">Next Cottus : prone he lay , chin uppermost ,</l>
     <l n="50">As though in pain ; for still upon the flint 50</l>
     <l n="51">He ground severe his skull , with open mouth</l>
     <l n="52">And eyes at horrid working . Nearest him</l>
     <l n="53">Asia , born of most enormous Caf ,</l>
     <l n="54">Who cost her mother Tellus keener pangs ,</l>
     <l n="55">Though feminine , than any of her sons :</l>
     <l n="56">More thought than woe was in her dusky face ,</l>
     <l n="57">For she was prophesying of her glory ;</l>
     <l n="58">And in her wide imagination stood</l>
     <l n="59">Palm-shaded temples , and high rival fanes ,</l>
     <l n="60">By Oxus or in Ganges ’ sacred isles . 60</l>
     <l n="61">Even as Hope upon her anchor leans ,</l>
     <l n="62">So leant she , not so fair , upon a tusk</l>
     <l n="63">Shed from the broadest of her elephants .</l>
     <l n="64">Above her , on a crag 's uneasy shelve ,</l>
     <l n="65">Upon his elbow rais 'd , all prostrate else ,</l>
     <l n="66">Shadow 'd Enceladus ; once tame and mild</l>
     <l n="67">As grazing ox unworried in the meads ;</l>
     <l n="68">Now tiger-passion 'd , lion-thoughted , wroth ,</l>
     <l n="69">He meditated , plotted , and even now</l>
     <l n="70">Was hurling mountains in that second war , 70</l>
     <l n="71">Not long delay 'd , that scar 'd the younger Gods</l>
     <l n="72">To hide themselves in forms of beast and bird .</l>
     <l n="73">Not far hence Atlas ; and beside him prone</l>
     <l n="74">Phorcus , the sire of Gorgons . Neighbour 'd close</l>
     <l n="75">Oceanus , and Tethys , in whose lap</l>
     <l n="76">Sobb 'd Clymene among her tangled hair .</l>
     <l n="77">In midst of all lay Themis , at the feet</l>
     <l n="78">Of Ops the queen all clouded round from sight ;</l>
     <l n="79">No shape distinguishable , more than when</l>
     <l n="80">Thick night confounds the pine-tops with the clouds : 80</l>
     <l n="81">And many else whose names may not be told .</l>
     <l n="82">For when the Muse 's wings are air-ward spread ,</l>
     <l n="83">Who shall delay her flight ? And she must chaunt</l>
     <l n="84">Of Saturn , and his guide , who now had climb 'd</l>
     <l n="85">With damp and slippery footing from a depth</l>
     <l n="86">More horrid still . Above a sombre cliff</l>
     <l n="87">Their heads appear 'd , and up their stature grew</l>
     <l n="88">Till on the level height their steps found ease :</l>
     <l n="89">Then Thea spread abroad her trembling arms</l>
     <l n="90">Upon the precincts of this nest of pain , 90</l>
     <l n="91">And sidelong fix 'd her eye on Saturn 's face :</l>
     <l n="92">There saw she direst strife ; the supreme God</l>
     <l n="93">At war with all the frailty of grief ,</l>
     <l n="94">Of rage , of fear , anxiety , revenge ,</l>
     <l n="95">Remorse , spleen , hope , but most of all despair .</l>
     <l n="96">Against these plagues he strove in vain ; for Fate</l>
     <l n="97">Had pour 'd a mortal oil upon his head ,</l>
     <l n="98">A disanointing poison : so that Thea ,</l>
     <l n="99">Affrighted , kept her still , and let him pass</l>
     <l n="100">First onwards in , among the fallen tribe . 100</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="101">As with us mortal men , the laden heart</l>
     <l n="102">Is persecuted more , and fever 'd more ,</l>
     <l n="103">When it is nighing to the mournful house</l>
     <l n="104">Where other hearts are sick of the same bruise ;</l>
     <l n="105">So Saturn , as he walk 'd into the midst ,</l>
     <l n="106">Felt faint , and would have sunk among the rest ,</l>
     <l n="107">But that he met Enceladus 's eye ,</l>
     <l n="108">Whose mightiness , and awe of him , at once</l>
     <l n="109">Came like an inspiration ; and he shouted ,</l>
     <l n="110">“ Titans , behold your God ! ” at which some groan 'd ; 110</l>
     <l n="111">Some started on their feet ; some also shouted ;</l>
     <l n="112">Some wept , some wail 'd , all bow 'd with reverence ;</l>
     <l n="113">And Ops , uplifting her black folded veil ,</l>
     <l n="114">Show 'd her pale cheeks , and all her forehead wan ,</l>
     <l n="115">Her eye-brows thin and jet , and hollow eyes .</l>
     <l n="116">There is a roaring in the bleak-grown pines</l>
     <l n="117">When Winter lifts his voice ; there is a noise</l>
     <l n="118">Among immortals when a God gives sign ,</l>
     <l n="119">With hushing finger , how he means to load</l>
     <l n="120">His tongue with the full weight of utterless thought , 120</l>
     <l n="121">With thunder , and with music , and with pomp :</l>
     <l n="122">Such noise is like the roar of bleak-grown pines ;</l>
     <l n="123">Which , when it ceases in this mountain 'd world ,</l>
     <l n="124">No other sound succeeds ; but ceasing here ,</l>
     <l n="125">Among these fallen , Saturn 's voice therefrom</l>
     <l n="126">Grew up like organ , that begins anew</l>
     <l n="127">Its strain , when other harmonies , stopt short ,</l>
     <l n="128">Leave the dinn 'd air vibrating silverly .</l>
     <l n="129">Thus grew it up — “ Not in my own sad breast ,</l>

     <l n="132">Not in the legends of the first of days ,</l>

   <p>INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA .</p>
   <p>Lamia , like Endymion , is written in the heroic couplet , but the difference in style is very marked . The influence of Dryden 's narrative-poems ( his translations from Boccaccio and Chaucer ) is clearly traceable in the metre , style , and construction of the later poem . Like Dryden , Keats now makes frequent use of the Alexandrine , or 6-foot line , and of the triplet . He has also restrained the exuberance of his language and gained force , whilst in imaginative power and felicity of diction he surpasses anything of which Dryden was capable . The flaws in his style are mainly due to carelessness in the rimes and some questionable coining of words . He also occasionally lapses into the vulgarity and triviality which marred certain of his early poems .</p>
   <p>The best he gained from his study of Dryden 's Fables , a debt perhaps to Chaucer rather than to Dryden , was a notable advance in constructive power . In Lamia he shows a very much greater sense of proportion and power of selection than in his earlier work . There is , as it were , more light and shade .</p>
   <p>Thus we find that whenever the occasion demands it his style rises to supreme force and beauty . The metamorphosis of the serpent , the entry of Lamia and Lycius into Corinth , the building by Lamia of the Fairy Hall , and her final withering under the eye of Apollonius — these are the most important points in the story , and the passages in which they are described are also the most striking in the poem .</p>
   <p>The allegorical meaning of the story seems to be , that it is fatal to attempt to separate the sensuous and emotional life from the life of reason . Philosophy alone is cold and destructive , but the pleasures of the senses alone are unreal and unsatisfying . The man who attempts such a divorce between the two parts of his nature will fail miserably as did Lycius , who , unable permanently to exclude reason , was compelled to face the death of his illusions , and could not , himself , survive them .</p>
   <p>Of the poem Keats himself says , writing to his brother in September , 1819 : ‘ I have been reading over a part of a short poem I have composed lately , called Lamia , and I am certain there is that sort of fire in it that must take hold of people some way ; give them either pleasant or unpleasant sensation — what they want is a sensation of some sort . ’ But to the greatest of Keats 's critics , Charles Lamb , the poem appealed somewhat differently , for he writes , ‘ More exuberantly rich in imagery and painting [ than Isabella ] is the story of Lamia . It is of as gorgeous stuff as ever romance was composed of , ’ and , after enumerating the most striking pictures in the poem , he adds , ‘ [ these ] are all that fairy-land can do for us . ’ Lamia struck his imagination , but his heart was given to Isabella .</p>

Hermes , the Star of Lethe , as he is called by one of those prodigal phrases which Mr. Keats abounds in , which are each a poem in a word , and which in this instance lays open to us at once , like a picture , all the dim regions and their habitants , and the sudden coming of a celestial among them . ’</p>

   <p>PART II .</p>
   <p>PAGE 27. ll . 1-9 . Again a passage unworthy of Keats 's genius . Perhaps the attempt to be light , like his seventeenth-century model , Dryden , led him for the moment to adopt something of the cynicism of that age about love .</p>
   <p>ll . 7-9. i. e . If Lycius had lived longer his experience might have either contradicted or corroborated this saying .</p>

   <p>INTRODUCTION TO ISABELLA AND THE EVE OF ST. AGNES</p>
   <p>In Lamia and Hyperion , as in Endymion , we find Keats inspired by classic story , though the inspiration in each case came to him through Elizabethan writers . Here , on the other hand , mediaeval legend is his inspiration ; the ‘ faery broods ’ have driven ‘ nymph and satyr from the prosperous woods ’ . Akin to the Greeks as he was in spirit , in his instinctive personification of the lovely manifestations of nature , his style and method were really more naturally suited to the portrayal of mediaeval scenes , where he found the richness and warmth of colour in which his soul delighted .</p>
   <p>The story of Isabella he took from Boccaccio , an Italian writer of the fourteenth century , whose Decameron , a collection of one hundred stories , has been a store-house of plots for English writers . By Boccaccio the tale is very shortly and simply told , being evidently interesting to him mainly for its plot . Keats was attracted to it not so much by the action as by the passion involved , so that his enlargement of it means little elaboration of incident , but very much more dwelling on the psychological aspect . That is to say , he does not care so much what happens , as what the personages of the poem think and feel .</p>
   <p>Thus we see that the main incident of the story , the murder of Lorenzo , is passed over in a line — ‘ Thus was Lorenzo slain and buried in , ’ the next line , ‘ There , in that forest , did his great love cease , ’ bringing us back at once from the physical reality of the murder to the thought of his love , which is to Keats the central fact of the story .</p>
   <p>In the delineation of Isabella , her first tender passion of love , her agony of apprehension giving way to dull despair , her sudden wakening to a brief period of frenzied action , described in stanzas of incomparable dramatic force , and the ‘ peace ’ which followed when she</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Forgot the stars , the moon , the sun ,</l>
     <l n="2">And she forgot the blue above the trees ,</l>
     <l n="3">And she forgot the dells where waters run ,</l>
     <l n="4">And she forgot the chilly autumn breeze ;</l>
     <l n="5">She had no knowledge when the day was done ,</l>
     <l n="6">And the new morn she saw not —</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">culminating in the piteous death ‘ too lone and incomplete ’ — in the</l>
     <l n="8">delineation of all this Keats shows supreme power and insight .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">In the conception , too , of the tragic loneliness of Lorenzo 's ghost we</l>
     <l n="10">feel that nothing could be changed , added , or taken away .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Not quite equally happy are the descriptions of the cruel brothers , and of Lorenzo as the young lover . There is a tendency to exaggerate both their inhumanity and his gentleness , for purposes of contrast , which weakens where it would give strength .</p>
   <p>The Eve of St. Agnes , founded on a popular mediaeval legend , not being a tragedy like Isabella , cannot be expected to rival it in depth and intensity ; but in every other poetic quality it equals , where it does not surpass , the former poem .</p>
   <p>To be specially noted is the skilful use which Keats here makes of contrast — between the cruel cold without and the warm love within ; the palsied age of the Bedesman and Angela , and the eager youth of Porphyro and Madeline ; the noise and revel and the hush of Madeline 's bedroom , and , as Mr. Colvin has pointed out , in the moonlight which , chill and sepulchral when it strikes elsewhere , to Madeline is as a halo of glory , an angelic light .</p>
   <p>A mysterious charm is given to the poem by the way in which Keats endows inanimate things with a sort of half-conscious life . The knights and ladies of stone arouse the bedesman 's shuddering sympathy when he thinks of the cold they must be enduring ; ‘ the carven angels ’ ‘ star 'd ’ ‘ eager-eyed ’ from the roof of the chapel , and the scutcheon in Madeline 's window ‘ blush 'd with blood of queens and kings ’ .</p>
   <p>Keats 's characteristic method of description — the way in which , by his masterly choice of significant detail , he gives us the whole feeling of the situation , is here seen in its perfection . In stanza 1 each line is a picture and each picture contributes to the whole effect of painful chill . The silence of the sheep , the old man 's breath visible in the frosty air ,— these are things which many people would not notice , but it is such little things that make the whole scene real to us .</p>
   <p>There is another method of description , quite as beautiful in its way , which Coleridge adopted with magic effect in Christabel . This is to use the power of suggestion , to say very little , but that little of a kind to awaken the reader 's imagination and make him complete the picture . For example , we are told of Christabel —</p>

   <p>That Keats was a master of both ways of obtaining a romantic effect is shown by his La Belle Dame Sans Merci , considered by some people his masterpiece , where the rich detail of The Eve of St. Agnes is replaced by reserve and suggestion .</p>

    <head>NOTES ON ISABELLA .</head>
    <p n="1">Metre . The ottava rima of the Italians , the natural outcome of Keats 's turning to Italy for his story . This stanza had been used by Chaucer and the Elizabethans , and recently by Hookham Frere in The Monks and the Giants and by Byron in Don Juan . Compare Keats 's use of the form with that of either of his contemporaries , and notice how he avoids the epigrammatic close , telling in satire and mock-heroic , but inappropriate to a serious and romantic poem .</p>
    <p n="2">PAGE 49. l. 2. palmer , pilgrim . As the pilgrim seeks for a shrine where , through the patron saint , he may worship God , so Lorenzo needs a woman to worship , through whom he may worship Love .</p>

In stanza xxvii they are described as riding ‘ with their murder 'd man ’ .</p>

    <p n="39">PAGE 63. l. 217 . Notice the reticence with which the mere fact of the murder is stated — no details given . Keats wants the prevailing feeling to be one of pity rather than of horror .</p>
    <p n="40">ll . 219-20 . Ah . . . loneliness . We perpetually come upon this old belief — that the souls of the murdered cannot rest in peace . Cf . Hamlet , I. v. 8 , &amp; c .</p>

    <p n="46">l. 229. stifling : partly literal , since the widow 's weed is close-wrapping and voluminous — partly metaphorical , since the acceptance of fate stifles complaint .</p>
    <p n="47">l. 230. accursed bands . So long as a man hopes he is not free , but at the mercy of continual imaginings and fresh disappointments . When hope is laid aside , fear and disappointment go with it .</p>

These are the stanzas of which Lamb says , ‘ there is nothing more awfully simple in diction , more nakedly grand and moving in sentiment , in Dante , in Chaucer , or in Spenser ’ — and again , after an appreciation of Lamia , whose fairy splendours are ‘ for younger impressibilities ’ , he reverts to them , saying : ‘ To us an ounce of feeling is worth a pound of fancy ; and therefore we recur again , with a warmer gratitude , to the story of Isabella and the pot of basil , and those never-cloying stanzas which we have cited , and which we think should disarm criticism , if it be not in its nature cruel ; if it would not deny to honey its sweetness , nor to roses redness , nor light to the stars in Heaven ; if it would not bay the moon out of the skies , rather than acknowledge she is fair . ’ — The New Times , July 19 , 1820 .</p>

Boccaccio writes : ‘ Nor had she dug long before she found the body of her hapless lover , whereon as yet there was no trace of corruption or decay ; and thus she saw without any manner of doubt that her vision was true . And so , saddest of women , knowing that she might not bewail him there , she would gladly , if she could , have carried away the body and given it more honourable sepulture elsewhere ; but as she might not do so , she took a knife , and , as best she could , severed the head from the trunk , and wrapped it in a napkin and laid it in the lap of the maid ; and having covered the rest of the corpse with earth , she left the spot , having been seen by none , and went home . ’</p>

    <p n="93">NOTES ON THE EVE OF ST. AGNES .</p>
    <p n="94">See Introduction to Isabella and The Eve of St. Agnes , p. 212 .</p>
    <p n="95">St. Agnes was a martyr of the Christian Church who was beheaded just outside Rome in 304 because she refused to marry a Pagan , holding herself to be a bride of Christ . She was only 13 — so small and slender that the smallest fetters they could find slipped over her little wrists and fell to the ground . But they stripped , tortured , and killed her . A week after her death her parents dreamed that they saw her in glory with a white lamb , the sign of purity , beside her . Hence she is always pictured with lambs ( as her name signifies ) , and to the place of her martyrdom two lambs are yearly taken on the anniversary and blessed .

    <p n="161">INTRODUCTION TO THE ODE TO A NIGHTINGALE , ODE ON A GRECIAN URN , ODE ON MELANCHOLY , AND TO AUTUMN .</p>
    <p n="162">These four odes , which were all written in 1819 , the first three in the early months of that year , ought to be considered together , since the same strain of thought runs through them all and , taken all together , they seem to sum up Keats 's philosophy .</p>
    <p n="163">In all of them the poet looks upon life as it is , and the eternal principle of beauty , in the first three seeing them in sharp contrast ; in the last reconciling them , and leaving us content .</p>
    <p n="164">The first-written of the four , the Ode to a Nightingale , is the most passionately human and personal of them all . For Keats wrote it soon after the death of his brother Tom , whom he had loved devotedly and himself nursed to the end . He was feeling keenly the tragedy of a world ‘ where youth grows pale , and spectre-thin , and dies ’ , and the song of the nightingale , heard in a friend 's garden at Hampstead , made him long to escape with it from this world of realities and sorrows to the world of ideal beauty , which it seemed to him somehow to stand for and suggest . He did not think of the nightingale as an individual bird , but of its song , which had been beautiful for centuries and would continue to be beautiful long after his generation had passed away ; and the thought of this undying loveliness he contrasted bitterly with our feverishly sad and short life . When , by the power of imagination , he had left the world behind him and was absorbed in the vision of beauty roused by the bird 's song , he longed for death rather than a return to disillusionment .</p>
    <p n="165">So in the Grecian Urn he contrasts unsatisfying human life with art , which is everlastingly beautiful . The figures on the vase lack one thing only — reality ,— whilst on the other hand they are happy in not being subject to trouble , change , or death . The thought is sad , yet Keats closes this ode triumphantly , not , as in The Nightingale , on a note of disappointment . The beauty of this Greek sculpture , truly felt , teaches us that beauty at any rate is real and lasting , and that utter belief in beauty is the one thing needful in life .</p>
    <p n="166">In the Ode on Melancholy Keats , in a more bitter mood , finds the presence , in a fleeting world , of eternal beauty the source of the deepest melancholy . To encourage your melancholy mood , he tells us , do not look on the things counted sad , but on the most beautiful , which are only quickly-fading manifestations of the everlasting principle of beauty . It is then , when a man most deeply loves the beautiful , when he uses his capacities of joy to the utmost , that the full bitterness of the contrast between the real and the ideal comes home to him and crushes him . If he did not feel so much he would not suffer so much ; if he loved beauty less he would care less that he could not hold it long .</p>
    <p n="167">But in the ode To Autumn Keats attains to the serenity he has been seeking . In this unparalleled description of a richly beautiful autumn day he conveys to us all the peace and comfort which his spirit receives . He does not philosophize upon the spectacle or draw a moral from it , but he shows us how in nature beauty is ever present . To the momentary regret for spring he replies with praise of the present hour , concluding with an exquisite description of the sounds of autumn — its music , as beautiful as that of spring . Hitherto he has lamented the insecurity of a man 's hold upon the beautiful , though he has never doubted the reality of beauty and the worth of its worship to man . Now , under the influence of nature , he intuitively knows that beauty once seen and grasped is man 's possession for ever . He is in much the same position that Wordsworth was when he declared that</p>
    <p n="168">Nature never did betray The heart that loved her ; ‘ tis her privilege , Through all the years of this our life , to lead From joy to joy : for she can so inform The mind that is within us , so impress With quietness and beauty , and so feed With lofty thoughts , that neither evil tongues , Rash judgments , nor the sneers of selfish men , Nor greetings where no kindness is , nor all The dreary intercourse of daily life , Shall e'er prevail against us , or disturb Our cheerful faith , that all which we behold Is full of blessings .</p>
    <p n="169">This was not the last poem that Keats wrote , but it was the last which he wrote in the fulness of his powers . We can scarcely help wishing that , beautiful as were some of the productions of his last feverish year of life , this perfect ode , expressing so serene and untroubled a mood , might have been his last word to the world .</p>
    <p n="170">NOTES ON THE ODE TO A NIGHTINGALE .</p>
    <p n="171">In the early months of 1819 Keats was living with his friend Brown at Hampstead ( Wentworth Place ) . In April a nightingale built her nest in the garden , and Brown writes : ‘ Keats felt a tranquil and continual joy in her song ; and one morning he took his chair from the breakfast table to the grass-plot under a plum , where he sat for two or three hours . When he came into the house I perceived he had some scraps of paper in his hand , and these he was quietly thrusting behind the books . On inquiry , I found those scraps , four or five in number , contained his poetic feeling on the song of our nightingale . The writing was not well legible , and it was difficult to arrange the stanza on so many scraps . With his assistance I succeeded , and this was his Ode to a Nightingale . ’</p>

    <p n="208">INTRODUCTION TO THE ODE TO PSYCHE .</p>
    <p n="209">In one of his long journal-letters to his brother George , Keats writes , at the beginning of May , 1819 : ‘ The following poem — the last I have written — is the first and the only one with which I have taken even moderate pains . I have for the most part dashed off my lines in a hurry . This I have done leisurely — I think it reads the more richly for it , and will I hope encourage me to write other things in even a more peaceable and healthy spirit . You must recollect that Psyche was not embodied as a goddess before the time of Apuleius the Platonist , who lived after the Augustan age , and consequently the goddess was never worshipped or sacrificed to with any of the ancient fervour , and perhaps never thought of in the old religion — I am more orthodox than to let a heathen goddess be so neglected . ’ The Ode to Psyche follows .</p>
    <p n="210">The story of Psyche may be best told in the words of William Morris in the ‘ argument ’ to ‘ the story of Cupid and Psyche ’ in his Earthly Paradise :</p>
    <p n="211">‘ Psyche , a king 's daughter , by her exceeding beauty caused the people to forget Venus ; therefore the goddess would fain have destroyed her : nevertheless she became the bride of Love , yet in an unhappy moment lost him by her own fault , and wandering through the world suffered many evils at the hands of Venus , for whom she must accomplish fearful tasks . But the gods and all nature helped her , and in process of time she was re-united to Love , forgiven by Venus , and made immortal by the Father of gods and men . ’</p>

    <p n="228">INTRODUCTION TO FANCY .</p>
    <p n="229">This poem , although so much lighter in spirit , bears a certain relation in thought to Keats 's other odes . In the Nightingale the tragedy of this life made him long to escape , on the wings of imagination , to the ideal world of beauty symbolized by the song of the bird . Here finding all real things , even the most beautiful , pall upon him , he extols the fancy , which can escape from reality and is not tied by place or season in its search for new joys . This is , of course , only a passing mood , as the extempore character of the poetry indicates . We see more of settled conviction in the deeply-meditative Ode to Autumn , where he finds the ideal in the rich and ever-changing real .</p>
    <p n="230">This poem is written in the four-accent metre employed by Milton in L'Allegro and Il Penseroso , and we can often detect a similarity of cadence , and a resemblance in the scenes imagined .</p>

In any case it was , in Shakespeare 's time , frequented by the chief writers of the day , amongst them Ben Jonson , Beaumont , Fletcher , Selden , Carew , Donne , and Shakespeare himself . Beaumont , in a poetical epistle to Ben Jonson , writes :</p>
    <p n="244">What things have we seen Done at the Mermaid ! heard words that have been So nimble and so full of subtle flame , As if that any one from whence they came Had meant to put his whole wit in a jest , And has resolved to live a fool the rest Of his dull life .</p>

It was divided into twelve parts corresponding to the twelve months of the year , according to the position of the moon when full . Each of these parts had a sign by which it was known , and the sign of the tenth was a fish-tailed goat , to which Keats refers as the Mermaid . The word zodiac comes from the Greek + zôdion +, meaning a little animal , since originally all the signs were animals .</p>
    <p n="250">INTRODUCTION TO ROBIN HOOD .</p>
    <p n="251">Early in 1818 John Hamilton Reynolds , a friend of Keats , sent him two sonnets which he had written ‘ On Robin Hood ’ . Keats , in his letter of thanks , after giving an appreciation of Reynolds 's production , says : ‘ In return for your Dish of Filberts , I have gathered a few Catkins , I hope they 'll look pretty . ’ Then follow these lines , entitled , ‘ To J. H. R. in answer to his Robin Hood sonnets . ’ At the end he writes : ‘ I hope you will like them — they are at least written in the spirit of outlawry . ’</p>
    <p n="252">Robin Hood , the outlaw , was a popular hero of the Middle Ages . He was a great poacher of deer , brave , chivalrous , generous , full of fun , and absolutely without respect for law and order . He robbed the rich to give to the poor , and waged ceaseless war against the wealthy prelates of the church . Indeed , of his endless practical jokes , the majority were played upon sheriffs and bishops . He lived , with his ‘ merry men ’ , in Sherwood Forest , where a hollow tree , said to be his ‘ larder ’ , is still shown .</p>
    <p n="253">Innumerable ballads telling of his exploits were composed , the first reference to which is in the second edition of Langland 's Piers Plowman , c. 1377 . Many of these ballads still survive , but in all these traditions it is quite impossible to disentangle fact from fiction .</p>

    <p n="268">In a letter written to Reynolds from Winchester , in September , 1819 , Keats says : ‘ How beautiful the season is now — How fine the air . A temperate sharpness about it . Really , without joking , chaste weather — Dian skies — I never liked stubble-fields so much as now — Aye better than the chilly green of the spring . Somehow , a stubble-field looks warm — in the same way that some pictures look warm .

    <p n="288">INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION .</p>
    <p n="289">This poem deals with the overthrow of the primaeval order of Gods by Jupiter , son of Saturn the old king . There are many versions of the fable in Greek mythology , and there are many sources from which it may have come to Keats . At school he is said to have known the classical dictionary by heart , but his inspiration is more likely to have been due to his later reading of the Elizabethan poets , and their translations of classic story . One thing is certain , that he did not confine himself to any one authority , nor did he consider it necessary to be circumscribed by authorities at all . He used , rather than followed , the Greek fable , dealing freely with it and giving it his own interpretation .</p>
    <p n="290">The situation when the poem opens is as follows :— Saturn , king of the gods , has been driven from Olympus down into a deep dell , by his son Jupiter , who has seized and used his father 's weapon , the thunderbolt . A similar fate has overtaken nearly all his brethren , who are called by Keats Titans and Giants indiscriminately , though in Greek mythology the two races are quite distinct . These Titans are the children of Tellus and Coelus , the earth and sky , thus representing , as it were , the first birth of form and personality from formless nature . Before the separation of earth and sky , Chaos , a confusion of the elements of all things , had reigned supreme . One only of the Titans , Hyperion the sun-god , still keeps his kingdom , and he is about to be superseded by young Apollo , the god of light and song .</p>
    <p n="291">In the second book we hear Oceanus and Clymene his daughter tell how both were defeated not by battle or violence , but by the irresistible beauty of their dispossessors ; and from this Oceanus deduces ‘ the eternal law , that first in beauty should be first in might ’ . He recalls the fact that Saturn himself was not the first ruler , but received his kingdom from his parents , the earth and sky , and he prophesies that progress will continue in the overthrow of Jove by a yet brighter and better order . Enceladus is , however , furious at what he considers a cowardly acceptance of their fate , and urges his brethren to resist .</p>
    <p n="292">In Book I we saw Hyperion , though still a god , distressed by portents , and now in Book III we see the rise to divinity of his successor , the young Apollo . The poem breaks off short at the moment of Apollo 's metamorphosis , and how Keats intended to complete it we can never know .</p>
    <p n="293">It is certain that he originally meant to write an epic in ten books , and the publisher 's remark [ 245 : 1 ] at the beginning of the 1820 volume would lead us to think that he was in the same mind when he wrote the poem . This statement , however , must be altogether discounted , as Keats , in his copy of the poems , crossed it right out and wrote above , ‘ I had no part in this ; I was ill at the time . ’</p>
    <p n="294">Moreover , the last sentence ( from ‘ but ’ to ‘ proceeding ’ ) he bracketed , writing below , ‘ This is a lie . ’</p>
    <p n="295">This , together with other evidence external and internal , has led Dr. de Sélincourt to the conclusion that Keats had modified his plan and , when he was writing the poem , intended to conclude it in four books . Of the probable contents of the one-and-half unwritten books Mr. de Sélincourt writes : ‘ I conceive that Apollo , now conscious of his divinity , would have gone to Olympus , heard from the lips of Jove of his newly-acquired supremacy , and been called upon by the rebel three to secure the kingdom that awaited him . He would have gone forth to meet Hyperion , who , struck by the power of supreme beauty , would have found resistance impossible . Critics have inclined to take for granted the supposition that an actual battle was contemplated by Keats , but I do not believe that such was , at least , his final intention . In the first place , he had the example of Milton , whom he was studying very closely , to warn him of its dangers ; in the second , if Hyperion had been meant to fight he would hardly be represented as already , before the battle , shorn of much of his strength ; thus making the victory of Apollo depend upon his enemy 's unnatural weakness and not upon his own strength . One may add that a combat would have been completely alien to the whole idea of the poem as Keats conceived it , and as , in fact , it is universally interpreted from the speech of Oceanus in the second book . The resistance of Enceladus and the Giants , themselves rebels against an order already established , would have been dealt with summarily , and the poem would have closed with a description of the new age which had been inaugurated by the triumph of the Olympians , and , in particular , of Apollo the god of light and song . ’</p>
    <p n="296">The central idea , then , of the poem is that the new age triumphs over the old by virtue of its acknowledged superiority — that intellectual supremacy makes physical force feel its power and yield . Dignity and moral conquest lies , for the conquered , in the capacity to recognize the truth and look upon the inevitable undismayed .</p>
    <p n="297">Keats broke the poem off because it was too ‘ Miltonic ’ , and it is easy to see what he meant . Not only does the treatment of the subject recall that of Paradise Lost , the council of the fallen gods bearing special resemblance to that of the fallen angels in Book II of Milton 's epic , but in its style and syntax the influence of Milton is everywhere apparent . It is to be seen in the restraint and concentration of the language , which is in marked contrast to the wordiness of Keats 's early work , as well as in the constant use of classical constructions , [ 247 : 1 ] Miltonic inversions [ 247 : 2 ] and repetitions , [ 247 : 3 ] and in occasional reminiscences of actual lines and phrases in Paradise Lost . [ 247 : 4 ]</p>
    <p n="298">In Hyperion we see , too , the influence of the study of Greek sculpture upon Keats 's mind and art . This study had taught him that the highest beauty is not incompatible with definiteness of form and clearness of detail . To his romantic appreciation of mystery was now added an equal sense of the importance of simplicity , form , and proportion , these being , from its nature , inevitable characteristics of the art of sculpture . So we see that again and again the figures described in Hyperion are like great statues — clear-cut , massive , and motionless . Such are the pictures of Saturn and Thea in Book I , and of each of the group of Titans at the opening of Book II .</p>
    <p n="299">Striking too is Keats 's very Greek identification of the gods with the powers of Nature which they represent . It is this attitude of mind which has led some people — Shelley and Landor among them — to declare Keats , in spite of his ignorance of the language , the most truly Greek of all English poets . Very beautiful instances of this are the sunset and sunrise in Book I , when the departure of the sun-god and his return to earth are so described that the pictures we see are of an evening and morning sky , an angry sunset , and a grey and misty dawn .</p>
    <p n="300">But neither Miltonic nor Greek is Keats 's marvellous treatment of nature as he feels , and makes us feel , the magic of its mystery in such a picture as that of the</p>
    <p n="301">tall oaks Branch-charmèd by the earnest stars ,</p>
    <p n="302">or of the</p>
    <p n="303">dismal cirque Of Druid stones , upon a forlorn moor , When the chill rain begins at shut of eve , In dull November , and their chancel vault , The heaven itself , is blinded throughout night .</p>
    <p n="304">This Keats , and Keats alone , could do ; and his achievement is unique in throwing all the glamour of romance over a fragment ‘ sublime as Aeschylus ’ .</p>

The poem was intended to have been of equal length with Endymion , but the reception given to that work discouraged the author from proceeding . ’</p>
