    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">It is an ancient Mariner ,</l>
     <l n="2">And he stoppeth one of three .</l>
     <l n="3">“ By thy long grey beard and glittering eye ,</l>
     <l n="4">Now wherefore stopp'st thou me ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">“ The Bridegroom 's doors are opened wide ,</l>
     <l n="6">And I am next of kin ;</l>
     <l n="7">The guests are met , the feast is set :</l>
     <l n="8">May'st hear the merry din . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">He holds him with his skinny hand ,</l>
     <l n="10">“ There was a ship , ” quoth he .</l>
     <l n="11">“ Hold off ! unhand me , grey-beard loon ! ”</l>
     <l n="12">Eftsoons his hand dropt he .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">He holds him with his glittering eye —</l>
     <l n="14">The Wedding-Guest stood still ,</l>
     <l n="15">And listens like a three years child :</l>
     <l n="16">The Mariner hath his will .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">The Wedding-Guest sat on a stone :</l>
     <l n="18">He cannot chuse but hear ;</l>
     <l n="19">And thus spake on that ancient man ,</l>
     <l n="20">The bright-eyed Mariner .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">The ship was cheered , the harbour cleared ,</l>
     <l n="22">Merrily did we drop</l>
     <l n="23">Below the kirk , below the hill ,</l>
     <l n="24">Below the light-house top .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">The Sun came up upon the left ,</l>
     <l n="26">Out of the sea came he !</l>
     <l n="27">And he shone bright , and on the right</l>
     <l n="28">Went down into the sea .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">Higher and higher every day ,</l>
     <l n="30">Till over the mast at noon —</l>
     <l n="31">The Wedding-Guest here beat his breast ,</l>
     <l n="32">For he heard the loud bassoon .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">The bride hath paced into the hall ,</l>
     <l n="34">Red as a rose is she ;</l>
     <l n="35">Nodding their heads before her goes</l>
     <l n="36">The merry minstrelsy .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">The Wedding-Guest he beat his breast ,</l>
     <l n="38">Yet he cannot chuse but hear ;</l>
     <l n="39">And thus spake on that ancient man ,</l>
     <l n="40">The bright-eyed Mariner .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="41">And now the STORM-BLAST came , and he</l>
     <l n="42">Was tyrannous and strong :</l>
     <l n="43">He struck with his o'ertaking wings ,</l>
     <l n="44">And chased south along .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="45">With sloping masts and dipping prow ,</l>
     <l n="46">As who pursued with yell and blow</l>
     <l n="47">Still treads the shadow of his foe</l>
     <l n="48">And forward bends his head ,</l>
     <l n="49">The ship drove fast , loud roared the blast ,</l>
     <l n="50">And southward aye we fled .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="51">And now there came both mist and snow ,</l>
     <l n="52">And it grew wondrous cold :</l>
     <l n="53">And ice , mast-high , came floating by ,</l>
     <l n="54">As green as emerald .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="55">And through the drifts the snowy clifts</l>
     <l n="56">Did send a dismal sheen :</l>
     <l n="57">Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken —</l>
     <l n="58">The ice was all between .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="59">The ice was here , the ice was there ,</l>
     <l n="60">The ice was all around :</l>
     <l n="61">It cracked and growled , and roared and howled ,</l>
     <l n="62">Like noises in a swound !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="63">At length did cross an Albatross :</l>
     <l n="64">Thorough the fog it came ;</l>
     <l n="65">As if it had been a Christian soul ,</l>
     <l n="66">We hailed it in God 's name .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="67">It ate the food it ne'er had eat ,</l>
     <l n="68">And round and round it flew .</l>
     <l n="69">The ice did split with a thunder-fit ;</l>
     <l n="70">The helmsman steered us through !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="71">And a good south wind sprung up behind ;</l>
     <l n="72">The Albatross did follow ,</l>
     <l n="73">And every day , for food or play ,</l>
     <l n="74">Came to the mariners ’ hollo !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="75">In mist or cloud , on mast or shroud ,</l>
     <l n="76">It perched for vespers nine ;</l>
     <l n="77">Whiles all the night , through fog-smoke white ,</l>
     <l n="78">Glimmered the white Moon-shine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="79">“ God save thee , ancient Mariner !</l>
     <l n="80">From the fiends , that plague thee thus !—</l>
     <l n="81">Why look'st thou so ? ” — With my cross-bow</l>
     <l n="82">I shot the ALBATROSS .</l>

     <head>PART THE SECOND .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="21">
      <l n="83">The Sun now rose upon the right :</l>
      <l n="84">Out of the sea came he ,</l>
      <l n="85">Still hid in mist , and on the left</l>
      <l n="86">Went down into the sea .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="22">
      <l n="87">And the good south wind still blew behind</l>
      <l n="88">But no sweet bird did follow ,</l>
      <l n="89">Nor any day for food or play</l>
      <l n="90">Came to the mariners ’ hollo !</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="23">
      <l n="91">And I had done an hellish thing ,</l>
      <l n="92">And it would work ‘ em woe :</l>
      <l n="93">For all averred , I had killed the bird</l>
      <l n="94">That made the breeze to blow .</l>
      <l n="95">Ah wretch ! said they , the bird to slay</l>
      <l n="96">That made the breeze to blow !</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="24">
      <l n="97">Nor dim nor red , like God 's own head ,</l>
      <l n="98">The glorious Sun uprist :</l>
      <l n="99">Then all averred , I had killed the bird</l>
      <l n="100">That brought the fog and mist .</l>
      <l n="101">‘ Twas right , said they , such birds to slay ,</l>

      <l n="103">The fair breeze blew , the white foam flew ,</l>
      <l n="104">The furrow followed free :</l>
      <l n="105">We were the first that ever burst</l>
      <l n="106">Into that silent sea .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="26">
      <l n="107">Down dropt the breeze , the sails dropt down ,</l>
      <l n="108">‘ Twas sad as sad could be ;</l>
      <l n="109">And we did speak only to break</l>
      <l n="110">The silence of the sea !</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="27">
      <l n="111">All in a hot and copper sky ,</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="28">
      <l n="115">Day after day , day after day ,</l>
      <l n="116">We stuck , nor breath nor motion ;</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="30">
      <l n="123">The very deep did rot : O Christ !</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="33">
      <l n="135">And every tongue , through utter drought ,</l>
      <l n="136">Was withered at the root ;</l>

      <l n="146">How glazed each weary eye ,</l>
      <l n="147">When looking westward , I beheld</l>

     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="36">
      <l n="149">At first it seemed a little speck ,</l>

      <l n="157">With throats unslaked , with black lips baked ,</l>
