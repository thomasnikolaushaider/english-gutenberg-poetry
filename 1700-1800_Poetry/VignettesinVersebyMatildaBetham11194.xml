   <p>THESE VERSES ARE INSCRIBED TO LADY BETHAM , AS A TRIBUTE OF SINCERE RESPECT FOR HER AMIABLE QUALITIES .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>ADVERTISEMENT .</head>
    <head>As far as the seventy-fourth page , these Poems have been printed about two years ; during which many things happened likely to prevent their ever appearing . The time , however , is now come , and I have to-day found the remainder , up to where the lines end with</head>
     <l n="1">“ Its unpolluted birthright . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>On reading the whole over , they struck me with much surprise , as they appear in a singular manner prophetic . I wrote them with a general , and somewhat undefined view ; and they now take the aspect of speaking on what has since happened to myself — a long seclusion , during which I was bereft of the common means of study , having given rise to one that has turned out far more important than I at first imagined , and which I have continued since , to the exclusion of every other pursuit .</p>

     <l n="1">If writing Journals were my task ,</l>
     <l n="2">From cottagers to kings —</l>
     <l n="3">A little book I 'd only ask ,</l>
     <l n="4">And fill it full of wings !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Each pair should represent a day :</l>
     <l n="6">On some the sun should rise ,</l>
     <l n="7">While others bent their mournful way</l>
     <l n="8">Through cold and cloudy skies .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">And here I would the light'ning bring</l>
     <l n="10">With threatening , forked glare ;</l>

     <l n="12">Across the troubled air .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">Some faint and wearily should glide</l>
     <l n="14">Their broken flight along —</l>
     <l n="15">While some high in the air should ride</l>
     <l n="16">Dilated , bold , and strong .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Some agitated and adrift ,</l>
     <l n="18">Against their will should rove ;</l>
     <l n="19">Some , steering forward , sure and swift ,</l>
     <l n="20">Should scarcely seem to move —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">While others , happiest of their kind !</l>
     <l n="22">Should in the ether soar ,</l>

     <l n="24">No sorrow reach them more ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">When soon an arrow from below</l>

     <l n="29">The rapid and abrupt descent ,</l>

     <l n="33">But soon their beauty and their force</l>

     <l n="36">Careering they pursue .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">Alternately to rise and fall ,</l>

      <l n="41">Lucy , I think not of thy beauty ,</l>

      <l n="44">And with that happy , smiling face ,</l>
      <l n="45">Conveys more pleasure to thy friend ,</l>
      <l n="46">Than any outward charm could lend .</l>

      <l n="47">I see thy graceful babes caress thee ,</l>
      <l n="48">I mark thy wise , maternal care ,</l>
      <l n="49">And sadly do the words impress me ,</l>
      <l n="50">The magic words — that thou art fair .</l>
      <l n="51">I wonder that a tongue is found</l>
      <l n="52">To utter the unfeeling sound !</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="13">
      <l n="53">For , art thou not above such praises ?</l>
      <l n="54">And is this all that they can see ?</l>
      <l n="55">Poor is the joy such flattery raises ,</l>
      <l n="56">And , oh ! how much unworthy thee !</l>
      <l n="57">Unworthy one whose heart can feel</l>
      <l n="58">The voice of truth , the warmth of zeal !</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="14">
      <l n="59">O Lucy , thou art snatch 'd from folly ,</l>
      <l n="60">Become too tender to be vain ,</l>
      <l n="61">The world , it makes me melancholy ,</l>
      <l n="62">The world would lure thee back again !</l>
      <l n="63">And it would cost me many sighs ,</l>
      <l n="64">To see it win so bright a prize !</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="15">
      <l n="65">Though passing apprehensions move me ,</l>

      <l n="67">But , Lucy , I so truly love thee ,</l>
      <l n="68">So much admire thee as thou art ,</l>
      <l n="69">That , but the shadow of a fear ,</l>
      <l n="70">Wakes in my breast a pang sincere .</l>

     <l n="1">This twilight gloom . This lone retreat —</l>

     <l n="4">And all the lesser ills of life ,</l>
     <l n="5">Here only at the evening 's close ,</l>
     <l n="6">My weary spirit finds repose ;</l>
     <l n="7">My sinking heart its freedom gains ,</l>

      <l n="40">Above a fair and modest countenance ,</l>

      <l n="50">The prophecy of all these qualities ,</l>
      <l n="51">Refinement , gentleness , and mild resolve ;</l>

      <l n="53">And hold with patient intrepidity ,</l>
      <l n="54">The shield of calm resistance to its power .</l>
      <l n="55">It seem 'd as if no anger e'er could dwell</l>
      <l n="56">Within his bosom ; no blind prejudice</l>
      <l n="57">Distract his judgment ; and no folly call</l>
      <l n="58">For a reproof : as if Affection were</l>
