    <head>PREFACE TO THE POEMS .</head>
    <p n="1">The text of the present issue of Lord Byron 's Poetical Works is based on that of ‘ The Works of Lord Byron ’ , in six volumes , 12mo , which was published by John Murray in 1831 . That edition followed the text of the successive issues of plays and poems which appeared in the author 's lifetime , and were subject to his own revision , or that of Gifford and other accredited readers . A more or less thorough collation of the printed volumes with the MSS . which were at Moore 's disposal , yielded a number of variorum readings which have appeared in subsequent editions published by John Murray . Fresh collations of the text of individual poems with the original MSS . have been made from time to time , with the result that the text of the latest edition ( one-vol . 8vo , 1891 ) includes some emendations , and has been supplemented by additional variants . Textual errors of more or less importance , which had crept into the numerous editions which succeeded the seventeen-volume edition of 1832 , were in some instances corrected , but in others passed over . For the purposes of the present edition the printed text has been collated with all the MSS . which passed through Moore 's hands , and , also , for the first time , with MSS . of the following plays and poems , viz . ‘ English Bards , and Scotch Reviewers ’ ; ‘ Childe Harold ’ , Canto IV . ; ‘ Don Juan ’ , Cantos VI. - XVI . ; ‘ Werner ’ ; ‘ The Deformed Transformed ’ ; ‘ Lara ’ ; ‘ Parisina ’ ; ‘ The Prophecy of Dante ’ ; ‘ The Vision of Judgment ’ ; ‘ The Age of Bronze ’ ; ‘ The Island ’ . The only works of any importance which have been printed directly from the text of the first edition , without reference to the MSS ., are the following , which appeared in ‘ The Liberal ’ ( 1822-23 ) , viz . : ‘ Heaven and Earth ’ , ‘ The Blues ’ , and ‘ Morgante Maggiore ’ .</p>

    <docImprint>A new and , it is believed , an improved punctuation has been adopted . In this respect Byron did not profess to prepare his MSS . for the press , and the punctuation , for which Gifford is mainly responsible , has been reconsidered with reference solely to the meaning and interpretation of the sentences as they occur . In the ‘ Hours of Idleness and Other Early Poems ’ , the typography of the first four editions , as a rule , has been preserved . A uniform typography in accordance with modern use has been adopted for all poems of later date . Variants , being the readings of one or more MSS . or of successive editions , are printed in italics [ as footnotes . text Ed ] immediately below the text . They are marked by Roman numerals . Words and lines through which the author has drawn his pen in the MSS . or Revises are marked ‘ MS. erased ’ . Poems and plays are given , so far as possible , in chronological order . ‘ Childe Harold ’ and ‘ Don Juan ’ , which were written and published in parts , are printed continuously ; and minor poems , including the first four satires , have been arranged in groups according to the date of composition . Epigrams and ‘ jeux d'esprit ’ have been placed together , in chronological order , towards the end of the sixth volume . A Bibliography of the poems will immediately precede the Index at the close of the sixth volume . The edition contains at least thirty hitherto unpublished poems , including fifteen stanzas of the unfinished seventeenth canto of ‘ Don Juan ’ , and a considerable fragment of the third part of ‘ The Deformed Transformed ’ . The eleven unpublished poems from MSS . preserved at Newstead , which appear in the first volume , are of slight if any literary value , but they reflect with singular clearness and sincerity the temper and aspirations of the tumultuous and moody stripling to whom “ the numbers came , ” but who wisely abstained from printing them himself . Byron 's notes , of which many are published for the first time , and editorial notes , enclosed in brackets , are printed immediately below the variorum readings . The editorial notes are designed solely to supply the reader with references to passages in other works illustrative of the text , or to interpret expressions and allusions which lapse of time may have rendered obscure . Much of the knowledge requisite for this purpose is to be found in the articles of the ‘ Dictionary of National Biography ’ , to which the fullest acknowledgments are due ; and much has been arrived at after long research , involving a minute examination of the literature , the magazines , and often the newspapers of the period . Inasmuch as the poems and plays have been before the public for more than three quarters of a century , it has not been thought necessary to burden the notes with the eulogies and apologies of the great poets and critics who were Byron 's contemporaries , and regarded his writings , both for good and evil , for praise and blame , from a different standpoint from ours . Perhaps , even yet , the time has not come for a definite and positive appreciation of his genius . The tide of feeling and opinion must ebb and flow many times before his rank and station among the poets of all time will be finally adjudged . The splendour of his reputation , which dazzled his own countrymen , and , for the first time , attracted the attention of a contemporary European audience to an English writer , has faded , and belongs to history ; but the poet 's work remains , inviting a more intimate and a more extended scrutiny than it has hitherto received in this country . The reader who cares to make himself acquainted with the method of Byron 's workmanship , to unravel his allusions , and to follow the tenour of his verse , will , it is hoped , find some assistance in these volumes . I beg to record my especial thanks to the Earl of Lovelace for the use of MSS . of his grandfather 's poems , including unpublished fragments ; for permission to reproduce portraits in his possession ; and for valuable information and direction in the construction of some of the notes . My grateful acknowledgments are due to Dr. Garnett , C. B ., Dr. A. H. Murray , Mr. R. E. Graves , and other officials of the British Museum , for invaluable assistance in preparing the notes , and in compiling a bibliography of the poems . I have also to thank Mr. Leslie Stephen and others for important hints and suggestions with regard to the interpretation of some obscure passages in ‘ Hints from Horace ’ . In correcting the proofs for the press , I have had the advantage of the skill and knowledge of my friend Mr. Frank E. Taylor , of Chertsey , to whom my thanks are due . On behalf of the Publisher , I beg to acknowledge with gratitude the kindness of the Lady Dorchester , the Earl Stanhope , Lord Glenesk and Sir Theodore Martin , K. C. B ., for permission to examine MSS . in their possession ; and of Mrs. Chaworth Musters , for permission to reproduce her miniature of Miss Chaworth , and for other favours . He desires also to acknowledge the generous assistance of Mr. and Miss Webb , of Newstead Abbey , in permitting the publication of MS. poems , and in making transcripts for the press . I need hardly add that , throughout the progress of the work , the advice and direct assistance of Mr. John Murray and Mr. R. E. Prothero have been always within my reach . They have my cordial thanks . ERNEST HARTLEY COLERIDGE . [ facsimile of title page :] POEMS ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS . Virginibus Puerisque Canto . ( Hor . Lib , 3 . ‘ Ode 1 ’ . ) The only Apology necessary to be adduced , in extenuation of any errors in the following collection , is , that the Author has not yet completed his nineteenth year . December 23 ,<date>1806</date>. BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE TO ‘ HOURS OF IDLENESS AND OTHER EARLY POEMS ’ . There were four distinct issues of Byron 's Juvenilia . The first collection , entitled ‘ Fugitive Pieces ’ , was printed in quarto by S. and J. Ridge of Newark . Two of the poems , “ The Tear ” and the “ Reply to Some Verses of J. M. B. Pigot , Esq ., ” were signed “ BYRON ; ” but the volume itself , which is without a title-page , was anonymous . It numbers sixty-six pages , and consists of thirty-eight distinct pieces . The last piece , “ Imitated from Catullus . To Anna , ” is dated November 16 ,<date>1806</date>. The whole of this issue , with the exception of two or three copies , was destroyed . An imperfect copy , lacking pp . 17-20 and pp . 58-66 , is preserved at Newstead . A perfect copy , which had been retained by the Rev . J. T. Becher , at whose instance the issue was suppressed , was preserved by his family ( see ‘ Life ’ , by Karl Elze ,<date>1872</date>, p. 450 ) , and is now in the possession of Mr. H. Buxton Forman , C. B . A facsimile reprint of this unique volume , limited to one hundred copies , was issued , for private circulation only , from the Chiswick Press in<date>1886</date>.</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>Of the thirty-eight ‘ Fugitive Pieces ’ , two poems , viz . “ To Caroline ” and “ To Mary , ” together with the last six stanzas of the lines , “ To Miss E. P. [ To Eliza ] , ” have never been republished in any edition of Byron 's Poetical Works .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>A second edition , small octavo , of ‘ Fugitive Pieces ’ , entitled ‘ Poems on Various Occasions ’ , was printed by S. and J. Ridge of Newark , and distributed in January ,<date>1807</date>. This volume was issued anonymously . It numbers 144 pages , and consists of a reproduction of thirty-six ‘ Fugitive Pieces ’ , and of twelve hitherto unprinted poems — forty-eight in all . For references to the distribution of this issue — limited , says Moore , to one hundred copies — see letters to Mr. Pigot and the Earl of Clare , dated January 16 , February 6 ,<date>1807</date>, and undated letters of the same period to Mr. William Bankes and Mr. Falkner ( ‘ Life ’ , pp . 41 , 42 ) . The annotated copy of ‘ Poems on Various Occasions ’ , referred to in the present edition , is in the British Museum . Early in the summer ( June — July ) of<date>1807</date>, a volume , small octavo , named ‘ Hours of Idleness ’ — a title henceforth associated with Byron 's early poems — was printed and published by S. and J. Ridge of Newark , and was sold by the following<settlement>London</settlement>booksellers : Crosby and Co .; Longman , Hurst , Rees , and Orme ; F. and C. Rivington ; and J , Mawman . The full title is , ‘ Hours of Idleness ; a Series of Poems Original and Translated ’ . By George Gordon , Lord Byron , a Minor . It numbers 187 pages , and consists of thirty-nine poems . Of these , nineteen belonged to the original ‘ Fugitive Pieces ’ , eight had first appeared in ‘ Poems on Various Occasions ’ , and twelve were published for the first time . The “ Fragment of a Translation from the 9th Book of Virgil 's Æneid ” ( ‘ sic ’ ) , numbering sixteen lines , reappears as “ The Episode of Nisus and Euryalus , A Paraphrase from the Æneid , Lib . 9 , ” numbering 406 lines . The final collection , also in small octavo , bearing the title ‘ Poems Original and Translated ’ , by George Gordon , Lord Byron , second edition , was printed and published in<date>1808</date>by S. and J. Ridge of Newark , and sold by the same<settlement>London</settlement>booksellers as ‘ Hours of Idleness ’ . It numbers 174 pages , and consists of seventeen of the original ‘ Fugitive Pieces ’ , four of those first published in ‘ Poems on Various Occasions ’ , a reprint of the twelve poems first published in ‘ Hours of Idleness ’ , and five poems which now appeared for the first time — thirty-eight poems in all . Neither the title nor the contents of this so-called second edition corresponds exactly with the previous issue . Of the thirty-eight ‘ Fugitive Pieces ’ which constitute the suppressed quarto , only seventeen appear in all three subsequent issues . Of the twelve additions to ‘ Poems on Various Occasions ’ , four were excluded from ‘ Hours of Idleness ’ , and four more from ‘ Poems Original and Translated ’ . The collection of minor poems entitled ‘ Hours of Idleness ’ , which has been included in every edition of Byron 's Poetical Works issued by John Murray since<date>1831</date>, consists of seventy pieces , being the aggregate of the poems published in the three issues , ‘ Poems on Various Occasions ’ , ‘ Hours of Idleness ’ , and ‘ Poems Original and Translated ’ , together with five other poems of the same period derived from other sources . In the present issue a general heading , “ Hours of Idleness , and other Early Poems , ” has been applied to the entire collection of Early Poems ,<date>1802-1809</date>. The quarto has been reprinted ( excepting the lines “ To Mary , ” which Byron himself deliberately suppressed ) in its entirety , and in the original order . The successive additions to the ‘ Poems on Various Occasions ’ , ‘ Hours of Idleness ’ , and ‘ Poems Original and Translated ’ , follow in order of publication . The remainder of the series , viz . poems first published in Moore 's ‘ Life and Journals of Lord Byron ’ (<date>1830</date>) ; poems hitherto unpublished ; poems first published in the ‘ Works of Lord Byron ’ (<date>1832</date>) , and poems contributed to J. C. Hobhouse 's ‘ Imitations and Translations ’ (<date>1809</date>) , have been arranged in chronological order . ( For an important contribution to the bibliography of the quarto of<date>1806</date>, and of the other issues of Byron 's Juvenilia , see papers by Mr. R. Edgcumbe , Mr. H. Buxton Forman , C. B ., and others , in the ‘ Athenaeum ’ ,<date>1885</date>, vol . ii . pp . 731-733 , 769 ; and<date>1886</date>, vol . i. p. 101 , etc . For a collation of the contents of the four first issues and of certain large-paper copies of ‘ Hours of Idleness ’ , etc ., see ‘ The Bibliography of the Poetical Works of Lord Byron ’ , vol . vi . of the present edition . ) [ text of facsimile pages of two different editions mentioned above :] HOURS OF IDLENESS ,</docImprint>

    <docImprint>The MS. ( ‘ MS. M . ’ ) of the first draft of Byron 's “ Satire ” ( see Letter to Pigot , October 26 ,<date>1807</date>) is now in Mr. Murray 's possession . It is written on folio sheets paged 6-25 , 28-41 , and numbers 360 lines . Mutilations on pages 12 , 13 , 34 , 35 account for the absence of ten additional lines . After the publication of the January number of ‘ The Edinburgh Review ’ for<date>1808</date>( containing the critique on ‘ Hours of Idleness ’ ) , which was delayed till the end of February , Byron added a beginning and an ending to the original draft . The MSS . of these additions , which number ninety lines , are written on quarto sheets , and have been bound up with the folios . ( Lines 1-16 are missing . ) The poem , which with these and other additions had run up to 560 lines , was printed in book form ( probably by Ridge of Newark ) , under the title of ‘ British Bards , A Satire ’ . “ This Poem , ” writes Byron [ ‘ MSS . M . ’ ] , “ was begun in October ,<date>1807</date>, in<settlement>London</settlement>, and at different intervals composed from that period till September ,<date>1808</date>, when it was completed at Newstead Abbey .— B .,<date>1808</date>. ” A date ,<date>1808</date>, is affixed to the last line . Only one copy is extant , that which was purchased , in<date>1867</date>, from the executors of R. C . Dallas , by the Trustees of the British Museum . Even this copy has been mutilated . Pages 17 , 18 , which must have contained the first version of the attack on Jeffrey ( see ‘ English Bards ’ , p. 332 , line 439 , ‘ note ’ 2 ) , have been torn out , and quarto proof-sheets in smaller type of lines 438-527 , “ Hail to immortal Jeffrey , ” etc ., together with a quarto proof-sheet , in the same type as ‘ British Bards ’ , containing lines 540-559 , “ Illustrious Holland , ” etc ., have been inserted . Hobhouse 's lines ( first edition , lines 247-262 ) , which are not in the original draft , are included in ‘ British Bards ’ . The insertion of the proofs increased the printed matter to 584 lines . After the completion of this revised version of ‘ British Bards ’ , additions continued to be made . Marginal corrections and MS. fragments , bound up with ‘ British Bards ’ , together with forty-four lines ( lines 723-726 , 819-858 ) which do not occur in MS. M ., make up with the printed matter the 696 lines which were published in March ,<date>1809</date>, under the title of ‘ English Bards , and Scotch Reviewers ’ . The folio and quarto sheets in Mr. Murray 's possession ( ‘ MS. M . ’ ) may be regarded as the MS. of ‘ British Bards ; British Bards ’ ( there are a few alterations , e. g . the substitution of lines 319-326 , “ Moravians , arise , ” etc ., for the eight lines on Pratt , which are to be found in the folio MS ., and are printed in ‘ British Bards ’ ) , with its accompanying MS. fragments , as the foundation of the text of the first edition of ‘ English Bards , and Scotch Reviewers ’ . Between the first edition , published in March , and the second edition in October ,<date>1809</date>, the difference is even greater than between the first edition and ‘ British Bards ’ . The Preface was enlarged , and a postscript affixed to the text of the poem . Hobhouse 's lines ( first edition , 247-262 ) were omitted , and the following additional passages inserted , viz . : ( i . ) lines 1-96 , “ Still must I hear , ” etc . ; ( ii . ) lines 129-142 , “ Thus saith the Preacher , ” etc . ; ( iii . ) lines 363-417 , “ But if some new-born whim , ” etc . ; ( iv . ) lines 638-706 , “ Or hail at once , ” etc . ; ( v .) lines 765-798 , “ When some brisk youth , ” etc . ; ( vi . ) lines 859-880 , “ And here let Shee , ” etc . ; ( vii . ) lines 949-960 , “ Yet what avails , ” etc . ; ( viii . ) lines 973-980 , “ There , Clarke , ” etc . ; ( ix . ) lines<date>1011-1070</date>, “ Then hapless Britain , ” etc . These additions number 370 lines , and , together with the 680 lines of the first edition ( reduced from 696 by the omission of Hobhouse 's contribution ) , make up the<date>1050</date>lines of the second and third editions , and the doubtful fourth edition of<date>1810</date>. Of these additions , Nos . i ., ii ., iii ., iv ., vi ., viii ., ix . exist in MS ., and are bound up with the folio MS. now in Mr. Murray 's possession . The third edition , which is , generally , dated<date>1810</date>, is a replica of the second edition . The first issue of the fourth edition , which appeared in<date>1810</date>, is identical with the second and third editions . A second issue of the fourth edition , dated<date>1811</date>, must have passed under Byron 's own supervision . Lines 723 , 724 are added , and lines 725 , 726 are materially altered . The fourth edition of<date>1811</date>numbers<date>1052</date>lines . The suppressed fifth edition , numbering<date>1070</date>lines ( the copy in the British Museum has the title-page of the fourth edition ; a second copy , in Mr. Murray 's possession , has no title-page ) , varies from the fourth edition of<date>1811</date>by the addition of lines 97-102 and 528-539 , and by some twenty-nine emendations of the text . Eighteen of these emendations were made by Byron in a copy of the fourth edition which belonged to Leigh Hunt . On another copy , in Mr. Murray 's possession , Byron made nine emendations , of which six are identical with those in the Hunt copy , and three appear for the first time . It was in the latter volume that he inscribed his after-thoughts , which are dated “ B .<date>1816</date>. ” For a complete collation of the five editions of ‘ English Bards , and Scotch Reviewers ’ , and textual emendations in the two annotated volumes , and for a note on genuine and spurious copies of the first and other editions , see ‘ The Bibliography of the Poetical Works of Lord Byron ’ , vol . vi .

His nephew and heir-at-law , Sir John Byron , of Clayton , K. B . ( 1599-1652 ) , was raised to the peerage as Baron Byron of Rochdale , after the Battle of Newbury , October 26 , 1643 . He held successively the posts of Lieutenant of the Tower , Governor of Chester , and , after the expulsion of the Royal Family from England , Governor to the Duke of York . He died childless , and was succeeded by his brother Richard , the second lord , from whom the poet was descended . Five younger brothers , as Richard 's monument in the chancel of Hucknall Torkard Church records , “ faithfully served King Charles the First in the Civil Wars , suffered much for their loyalty , and lost all their present fortunes . ” ( See Life of Lord Byron , by Karl Elze : Appendix , Note ( A ) , p . 436 . )</note>

   <note xml:id="note1_3" place="bottom" n="1">The author claims the indulgence of the reader more for this piece than , perhaps , any other in the collection ; but as it was written at an earlier period than the rest ( being composed at the age of fourteen ) , and his first essay , he preferred submitting it to the indulgence of his friends in its present state , to making either addition or alteration .— [ 4to</note>
   <p>“ My first dash into poetry was as early as 1800 . It was the ebullition of a passion for — my first cousin , Margaret Parker ( daughter and granddaughter of the two Admirals Parker ) , one of the most beautiful of evanescent beings . I have long forgotten the verse ; but it would be difficult for me to forget her — her dark eyes — her long eye-lashes — her completely Greek cast of face and figure ! I was then about twelve — she rather older , perhaps a year . She died about a year or two afterwards , in consequence of a fall , which injured her spine , and induced consumption ... I knew nothing of her illness , being at Harrow and in the country till she was gone . Some years after , I made an attempt at an elegy — a very dull one . ” — Byron Diary , 1821 ; Life , p. 17 .</p>
   <note>Margaret Parker was the sister of Sir Peter Parker , whose death at Baltimore , in 1814 , Byron celebrated in the “ Elegiac Stanzas , ” which were first published in the poems attached to the seventh edition of Childe Harold .</note>

He was reconciled to Dr. Butler before departing for Greece , in 1809 , and in his diary he says , “ I treated him rebelliously , and have been sorry ever since . ” ( See allusions in and notes to “ Childish Recollections , ” pp . 84-106 , and especially note I , p. 88 , notes I and 2 , p. 89 , and note I , p . 91 . )</note>

   <p>No reflection is here intended against the person mentioned under the name of Magnus . He is merely represented as performing an unavoidable function of his office . Indeed , such an attempt could only recoil upon myself ; as that gentleman is now as much distinguished by his eloquence , and the dignified propriety with which he fills his situation , as he was in his younger days for wit and conviviality .</p>
   <note>Dr. William Lort Mansel ( 1753-1820 ) was , in 1798 , appointed Master of Trinity College , by Pitt . He obtained the bishopric of Bristol , through the influence of his pupil , Spencer Perceval , in 1808 . He died in 1820 .</note>

[ Richard Porson ( 1759-1808 ) . For Byron 's description of him , see letter to Murray , of February 20 , 1818 . Byron says ( ‘ Diary ’ , December 17 , 18 , 1813 ) that he wrote the ‘ Devil 's Drive ’ in imitation of Porson 's ‘ Devil 's Walk ’ . This was a common misapprehension at the time . The ‘ Devil 's Thoughts ’ was the joint composition of Coleridge and Southey , but it was generally attributed to Porson , who took no trouble to disclaim it . It was originally published in the ‘ Morning Post ’ , Sept. 6 , 1799 , and Stuart , the editor , said that it raised the circulation of the paper for several days after .

Such has been the candour of some ingenious critics . We would advise these ‘ liberal ’ commentators on taste and arbiters of decorum to read ‘ Shakespeare ’ .</note>
   <p>Having heard that a very severe and indelicate censure has been passed on the above poem , I beg leave to reply in a quotation from an admired work , ‘ Carr 's Stranger in France ’ .— “ As we were contemplating a painting on a large scale , in which , among other figures , is the uncovered whole length of a warrior , a prudish-looking lady , who seemed to have touched the age of desperation , after having attentively surveyed it through her glass , observed to her party that there was a great deal of indecorum in that picture . Madame S. shrewdly whispered in my ear ‘ that the indecorum was in the remark . ’ ” — [ Ed . 1803 , cap . xvi , p. 171 .

   <p>A remonstrance which Lord Clare addressed to him at school ; was found among his papers ( as were most of the notes of his early favourites ) , and on the back of it was an endorsement which is a fresh testimony of his affection :—</p>
   <p>“ This and another letter were written at Harrow , by my ‘ then ’ and , I hope , ‘ ever ’ beloved friend , Lord Clare , when we were both schoolboys ; and sent to my study in consequence of some ‘ childish ’ misunderstanding ,— the only one which ever arose between us . It was of short duration , and I retain this note solely for the purpose of submitting it to his perusal , that we may smile over the recollection of the insignificance of our first and last quarrel . ”</p>
   <p>See , also , Byron 's account of his accidental meeting with Lord Clare in Italy in 1821 , as recorded in ‘ Detached Thoughts ’ , Nov. 5 , 1821 ; in letters to Moore , March 1 and June 8 , 1822 ; and Mme . Guiccioli 's description of his emotion on seeing Clare ( ‘ My Recollections of Lord Byron ’ , ed . 1869 , p. 156 ) . ]</p>

   <note xml:id="note1_36" place="bottom" n="1">The Rev . John Thomas Becher ( 1770-1848 ) was Vicar of Rumpton and Midsomer Norton , Notts ., and made the acquaintance of Byron when he was living at Southwell . To him was submitted an early copy of the ‘ Quarto ’ , and on his remonstrance at the tone of some of the verses , the whole edition ( save one or two copies ) was burnt . Becher assisted in the revision of ‘ P. on V. Occasions ’ , published in 1807 . He was in 1818 appointed Prebendary of Southwell , and , all his life , took an active interest and prominent part in the administration of the poor laws and the welfare of the poor . ( See Byron 's letters to him of February 26 and March 28 , 1808 . )</note>

    <head>ODE 3 .</head>
     <l n="1">‘ Twas now the hour when Night had driven</l>
     <l n="2">Her car half round yon sable heaven ;</l>
     <l n="3">Boötes , only , seem 'd to roll [ i ]</l>
     <l n="4">His Arctic charge around the Pole ;</l>
     <l n="5">While mortals , lost in gentle sleep ,</l>
     <l n="6">Forgot to smile , or ceas 'd to weep :</l>
     <l n="7">At this lone hour the Paphian boy ,</l>
     <l n="8">Descending from the realms of joy ,</l>
     <l n="9">Quick to my gate directs his course ,</l>
     <l n="10">And knocks with all his little force ;</l>
     <l n="11">My visions fled , alarm 'd I rose ,—</l>
     <l n="12">“ What stranger breaks my blest repose ? ”</l>
     <l n="13">“ Alas ! ” replies the wily child</l>
     <l n="14">In faltering accents sweetly mild ;</l>
     <l n="15">“ A hapless Infant here I roam ,</l>
     <l n="16">Far from my dear maternal home .</l>
     <l n="17">Oh ! shield me from the wintry blast !</l>
     <l n="18">The nightly storm is pouring fast .</l>
     <l n="19">No prowling robber lingers here ;</l>
     <l n="20">A wandering baby who can fear ? ”</l>
     <l n="21">I heard his seeming artless tale , [ ii ]</l>
     <l n="22">I heard his sighs upon the gale :</l>
     <l n="23">My breast was never pity 's foe ,</l>
     <l n="24">But felt for all the baby 's woe .</l>
     <l n="25">I drew the bar , and by the light</l>
     <l n="26">Young Love , the infant , met my sight ;</l>
     <l n="27">His bow across his shoulders flung ,</l>
     <l n="28">And thence his fatal quiver hung</l>
     <l n="29">( Ah ! little did I think the dart</l>
     <l n="30">Would rankle soon within my heart ) .</l>
     <l n="31">With care I tend my weary guest ,</l>
     <l n="32">His little fingers chill my breast ;</l>
     <l n="33">His glossy curls , his azure wing ,</l>
     <l n="34">Which droop with nightly showers , I wring ;</l>
     <l n="35">His shivering limbs the embers warm ;</l>
     <l n="36">And now reviving from the storm ,</l>
     <l n="37">Scarce had he felt his wonted glow ,</l>
     <l n="38">Than swift he seized his slender bow :—</l>
     <l n="39">“ I fain would know , my gentle host , ”</l>
     <l n="40">He cried , “ if this its strength has lost ;</l>
     <l n="41">I fear , relax 'd with midnight dews ,</l>
     <l n="42">The strings their former aid refuse . ”</l>
     <l n="43">With poison tipt , his arrow flies ,</l>
     <l n="44">Deep in my tortur 'd heart it lies :</l>
     <l n="45">Then loud the joyous Urchin laugh 'd :—</l>
     <l n="46">“ My bow can still impel the shaft :</l>
     <l n="47">‘ Tis firmly fix 'd , thy sighs reveal it ;</l>
     <l n="48">Say , courteous host , canst thou not feel it ? ”</l>

    <head>A PARAPHRASE FROM THE “ ÆNEID , ” LIB . 9 .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Nisus , the guardian of the portal , stood ,</l>
     <l n="2">Eager to gild his arms with hostile blood ;</l>
     <l n="3">Well skill 'd , in fight , the quivering lance to wield ,</l>
     <l n="4">Or pour his arrows thro ’ th ’ embattled field :</l>
     <l n="5">From Ida torn , he left his sylvan cave , [ i ]</l>
     <l n="6">And sought a foreign home , a distant grave .</l>
     <l n="7">To watch the movements of the Daunian host ,</l>
     <l n="8">With him Euryalus sustains the post ;</l>
     <l n="9">No lovelier mien adorn 'd the ranks of Troy ,</l>
     <l n="10">And beardless bloom yet grac 'd the gallant boy ; 10</l>
     <l n="11">Though few the seasons of his youthful life ,</l>
     <l n="12">As yet a novice in the martial strife ,</l>
     <l n="13">‘ Twas his , with beauty , Valour 's gifts to share —</l>
     <l n="14">A soul heroic , as his form was fair :</l>
     <l n="15">These burn with one pure flame of generous love ;</l>
     <l n="16">In peace , in war , united still they move ;</l>
     <l n="17">Friendship and Glory form their joint reward ;</l>
     <l n="18">And , now , combin 'd they hold their nightly guard . [ ii ]</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="19">“ What God , ” exclaim 'd the first , “ instils this fire ?</l>
     <l n="20">Or , in itself a God , what great desire ? 20</l>
     <l n="21">My lab'ring soul , with anxious thought oppress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="22">Abhors this station of inglorious rest ;</l>
     <l n="23">The love of fame with this can ill accord ,</l>
     <l n="24">Be't mine to seek for glory with my sword .</l>
     <l n="25">See'st thou yon camp , with torches twinkling dim ,</l>
     <l n="26">Where drunken slumbers wrap each lazy limb ?</l>
     <l n="27">Where confidence and ease the watch disdain ,</l>
     <l n="28">And drowsy Silence holds her sable reign ?</l>
     <l n="29">Then hear my thought :— In deep and sullen grief</l>
     <l n="30">Our troops and leaders mourn their absent chief : 30</l>
     <l n="31">Now could the gifts and promised prize be thine ,</l>
     <l n="32">( The deed , the danger , and the fame be mine ,)</l>
     <l n="33">Were this decreed , beneath yon rising mound ,</l>
     <l n="34">Methinks , an easy path , perchance , were found ;</l>
     <l n="35">Which past , I speed my way to Pallas ’ walls ,</l>
     <l n="36">And lead Æneas from Evander 's halls . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="37">With equal ardour fir 'd , and warlike joy ,</l>
     <l n="38">His glowing friend address 'd the Dardan boy :—</l>
     <l n="39">“ These deeds , my Nisus , shalt thou dare alone ?</l>
     <l n="40">Must all the fame , the peril , be thine own ? 40</l>
     <l n="41">Am I by thee despis 'd , and left afar ,</l>
     <l n="42">As one unfit to share the toils of war ?</l>
     <l n="43">Not thus his son the great Opheltes taught :</l>
     <l n="44">Not thus my sire in Argive combats fought ;</l>
     <l n="45">Not thus , when Ilion fell by heavenly hate ,</l>
     <l n="46">I track 'd Æneas through the walks of fate :</l>
     <l n="47">Thou know'st my deeds , my breast devoid of fear ,</l>
     <l n="48">And hostile life-drops dim my gory spear .</l>
     <l n="49">Here is a soul with hope immortal burns ,</l>
     <l n="50">And life , ignoble life , for Glory spurns . [ iii ] 50</l>
     <l n="51">Fame , fame is cheaply earn 'd by fleeting breath :</l>
     <l n="52">The price of honour , is the sleep of death . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="53">Then Nisus :— “ Calm thy bosom 's fond alarms : [ iv ]</l>
     <l n="54">Thy heart beats fiercely to the din of arms .</l>
     <l n="55">More dear thy worth , and valour than my own ,</l>
     <l n="56">I swear by him , who fills Olympus ’ throne !</l>
     <l n="57">So may I triumph , as I speak the truth ,</l>
     <l n="58">And clasp again the comrade of my youth !</l>
     <l n="59">But should I fall ,— and he , who dares advance</l>
     <l n="60">Through hostile legions , must abide by chance ,— 60</l>
     <l n="61">If some Rutulian arm , with adverse blow ,</l>
     <l n="62">Should lay the friend , who ever lov 'd thee , low ,</l>
     <l n="63">Live thou — such beauties I would fain preserve —</l>
     <l n="64">Thy budding years a lengthen 'd term deserve ;</l>
     <l n="65">When humbled in the dust , let some one be ,</l>
     <l n="66">Whose gentle eyes will shed one tear for me ;</l>
     <l n="67">Whose manly arm may snatch me back by force ,</l>
     <l n="68">Or wealth redeem , from foes , my captive corse ;</l>
     <l n="69">Or , if my destiny these last deny ,</l>
     <l n="70">If , in the spoiler 's power , my ashes lie ; 70</l>
     <l n="71">Thy pious care may raise a simple tomb ,</l>
     <l n="72">To mark thy love , and signalise my doom .</l>
     <l n="73">Why should thy doating wretched mother weep</l>
     <l n="74">Her only boy , reclin 'd in endless sleep ?</l>
     <l n="75">Who , for thy sake , the tempest 's fury dar 'd ,</l>
     <l n="76">Who , for thy sake , war 's deadly peril shar 'd ;</l>
     <l n="77">Who brav 'd what woman never brav 'd before ,</l>
     <l n="78">And left her native , for the Latian shore . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="79">“ In vain you damp the ardour of my soul , ”</l>
     <l n="80">Replied Euryalus ; “ it scorns controul ; 80</l>
     <l n="81">Hence , let us haste ! ” — their brother guards arose ,</l>
     <l n="82">Rous 'd by their call , nor court again repose ;</l>
     <l n="83">The pair , buoy 'd up on Hope 's exulting wing ,</l>

     <l n="85">Now , o'er the earth a solemn stillness ran ,</l>

     <l n="89">On one great point the council are agreed ,</l>
     <l n="90">An instant message to their prince decreed ; 90</l>

     <l n="95">With anxious tremors , yet unaw 'd by fear , [ v ]</l>
     <l n="96">The faithful pair before the throne appear ;</l>

     <l n="107">If you , ye Chiefs , and Fortune will allow ,</l>

     <l n="119">Mature in years , for sober wisdom fam 'd ,</l>

   <p>THE DEATH OF CALMAR AND ORLA .<span corresp="#note1_49" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></p>
   <p>AN IMITATION OF MACPHERSON 'S “ OSSIAN ” .<span corresp="#note2_19" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span></p>
   <p>Dear are the days of youth ! Age dwells on their remembrance through the mist of time . In the twilight he recalls the sunny hours of morn . He lifts his spear with trembling hand . “ Not thus feebly did I raise the steel before my fathers ! ” Past is the race of heroes ! But their fame rises on the harp ; their souls ride on the wings of the wind ; they hear the sound through the sighs of the storm , and rejoice in their hall of clouds . Such is Calmar . The grey stone marks his narrow house . He looks down from eddying tempests : he rolls his form in the whirlwind , and hovers on the blast of the mountain .</p>
   <p>In Morven dwelt the Chief ; a beam of war to Fingal . His steps in the field were marked in blood . Lochlin 's sons had fled before his angry spear ; [ i ] but mild was the eye of Calmar ; soft was the flow of his yellow locks : they streamed like the meteor of the night . No maid was the sigh of his soul : his thoughts were given to friendship ,— to dark-haired Orla , destroyer of heroes ! Equal were their swords in battle ; but fierce was the pride of Orla :— gentle alone to Calmar . Together they dwelt in the cave of Oithona .</p>
   <p>From Lochlin , Swaran bounded o'er the blue waves . Erin 's sons fell beneath his might . Fingal roused his chiefs to combat . [ ii ] Their ships cover the ocean ! Their hosts throng on the green hills . They come to the aid of Erin .</p>
   <p>Night rose in clouds . Darkness veils the armies . But the blazing oaks gleam through the valley . [ iii ] The sons of Lochlin slept : their dreams were of blood . They lift the spear in thought , and Fingal flies . Not so the Host of Morven . To watch was the post of Orla . Calmar stood by his side . Their spears were in their hands . Fingal called his chiefs : they stood around . The king was in the midst . Grey were his locks , but strong was the arm of the king . Age withered not his powers . “ Sons of Morven , ” said the hero , “ to-morrow we meet the foe . But where is Cuthullin , the shield of Erin ? He rests in the halls of Tura ; he knows not of our coming . Who will speed through Lochlin , to the hero , and call the chief to arms ? The path is by the swords of foes ; but many are my heroes . They are thunderbolts of war . Speak , ye chiefs ! Who will arise ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Son of Trenmor ! mine be the deed , ” said dark-haired Orla , “ and mine alone . What is death to me ? I love the sleep of the mighty , but little is the danger . The sons of Lochlin dream . I will seek car-borne Cuthullin . If I fall , raise the song of bards ; and lay me by the stream of Lubar . ” — “ And shalt thou fall alone ? ” said fair-haired Calmar . “ Wilt thou leave thy friend afar ? Chief of Oithona ! not feeble is my arm in fight . Could I see thee die , and not lift the spear ? No , Orla ! ours has been the chase of the roebuck , and the feast of shells ; ours be the path of danger : ours has been the cave of Oithona ; ours be the narrow dwelling on the banks of Lubar . ” — “ Calmar , ” said the chief of Oithona , “ why should thy yellow locks be darkened in the dust of Erin ? Let me fall alone . My father dwells in his hall of air : he will rejoice in his boy ; but the blue-eyed Mora spreads the feast for her Son in Morven . She listens to the steps of the hunter on the heath , and thinks it is the tread of Calmar . Let her not say , ‘ Calmar has fallen by the steel of Lochlin : he died with gloomy Orla , the chief of the dark brow . ’ Why should tears dim the azure eye of Mora ? Why should her voice curse Orla , the destroyer of Calmar ? Live Calmar ! Live to raise my stone of moss ; live to revenge me in the blood of Lochlin . Join the song of bards above my grave . Sweet will be the song of Death to Orla , from the voice of Calmar . My ghost shall smile on the notes of Praise . ” “ Orla , ” said the son of Mora , “ could I raise the song of Death to my friend ? Could I give his fame to the winds ? No , my heart would speak in sighs : faint and broken are the sounds of sorrow . Orla ! our souls shall hear the song together . One cloud shall be ours on high : the bards will mingle the names of Orla and Calmar . ”</p>
   <p>They quit the circle of the Chiefs . Their steps are to the Host of Lochlin . The dying blaze of oak dim-twinkles through the night . The northern star points the path to Tura . Swaran , the King , rests on his lonely hill . Here the troops are mixed : they frown in sleep ; their shields beneath their heads . Their swords gleam , at distance in heaps . The fires are faint ; their embers fail in smoke . All is hushed ; but the gale sighs on the rocks above . Lightly wheel the Heroes through the slumbering band . Half the journey is past , when Mathon , resting on his shield , meets the eye of Orla . It rolls in flame , and glistens through the shade . His spear is raised on high . “ Why dost thou bend thy brow , chief of Oithona ? ” said fair-haired Calmar : “ we are in the midst of foes . Is this a time for delay ? ” “ It is a time for vengeance , ” said Orla of the gloomy brow . “ Mathon of Lochlin sleeps : seest thou his spear ? Its point is dim with the gore of my father . The blood of Mathon shall reek on mine : but shall I slay him sleeping , Son of Mora ? No ! he shall feel his wound : my fame shall not soar on the blood of slumber . Rise , Mathon , rise ! The Son of Conna calls ; thy life is his ; rise to combat . ” Mathon starts from sleep : but did he rise alone ? No : the gathering Chiefs bound on the plain . “ Fly ! Calmar , fly ! ” said dark-haired Orla . “ Mathon is mine . I shall die in joy : but Lochlin crowds around . Fly through the shade of night . ” Orla turns . The helm of Mathon is cleft ; his shield falls from his arm : he shudders in his blood . [ i ] He rolls by the side of the blazing oak . Strumon sees him fall : his wrath rises : his weapon glitters on the head of Orla : but a spear pierced his eye . His brain gushes through the wound , and foams on the spear of Calmar . As roll the waves of the Ocean on two mighty barks of the North , so pour the men of Lochlin on the Chiefs . As , breaking the surge in foam , proudly steer the barks of the North , so rise the Chiefs of Morven on the scattered crests of Lochlin . The din of arms came to the ear of Fingal . He strikes his shield ; his sons throng around ; the people pour along the heath . Ryno bounds in joy . Ossian stalks in his arms . Oscar shakes the spear . The eagle wing of Fillan floats on the wind . Dreadful is the clang of death ! many are the Widows of Lochlin . Morven prevails in its strength .</p>
   <p>Morn glimmers on the hills : no living foe is seen ; but the sleepers are many ; grim they lie on Erin . The breeze of Ocean lifts their locks ; yet they do not awake . The hawks scream above their prey .</p>
   <p>Whose yellow locks wave o'er the breast of a chief ? Bright as the gold of the stranger , they mingle with the dark hair of his friend . ‘ Tis Calmar : he lies on the bosom of Orla . Theirs is one stream of blood . Fierce is the look of the gloomy Orla . He breathes not ; but his eye is still a flame . It glares in death unclosed . His hand is grasped in Calmar 's ; but Calmar lives ! he lives , though low . “ Rise , ” said the king , “ rise , son of Mora : ‘ tis mine to heal the wounds of Heroes . Calmar may yet bound on the hills of Morven . ” [ v ]</p>
   <p>“ Never more shall Calmar chase the deer of Morven with Orla , ” said the Hero . “ What were the chase to me alone ? Who would share the spoils of battle with Calmar ? Orla is at rest ! Rough was thy soul , Orla ! yet soft to me as the dew of morn . It glared on others in lightning : to me a silver beam of night . Bear my sword to blue-eyed Mora ; let it hang in my empty hall . It is not pure from blood : but it could not save Orla . Lay me with my friend : raise the song when I am dark ! ”</p>
   <p>They are laid by the stream of Lubar . Four grey stones mark the dwelling of Orla and Calmar . When Swaran was bound , our sails rose on the blue waves . The winds gave our barks to Morven :— the bards raised the song .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ What Form rises on the roar of clouds ? Whose dark Ghost gleams on the</l>
     <l n="2">red streams of tempests ? His voice rolls on the thunder . ‘ Tis Orla , the</l>
     <l n="3">brown Chief of Oithona . He was unmatched in war . Peace to thy soul ,</l>
     <l n="4">Orla ! thy fame will not perish . Nor thine , Calmar ! Lovely wast thou , son</l>
     <l n="5">of blue-eyed Mora ; but not harmless was thy sword . It hangs in thy cave .</l>
     <l n="6">The Ghosts of Lochlin shriek around its steel . Hear thy praise , Calmar !</l>
     <l n="7">It dwells on the voice of the mighty . Thy name shakes on the echoes of</l>

Long was with Byron at Harrow , and was the only one of his intimate friends who went up at the same time as he did to Cambridge , where both were noted for feats of swimming and diving .

   <p>“ Our meetings were stolen ones . ... A gate leading from Mr. Chaworth 's grounds to those of my mother was the place of our interviews . The ardour was all on my side . I was serious ; she was volatile : she liked me as a younger brother , and treated and laughed at me as a boy ; she , however , gave me her picture , and that was something to make verses upon . Had I married her , perhaps , the whole tenour of my life would have been different . ”</p>

   <note xml:id="note3_13" place="bottom" n="3">Byron , in early youth , was “ unco ’ wastefu ’ ” of Marys . There was his distant cousin , Mary Duff ( afterwards Mrs. Robert Cockburn ) , who lived not far from the “ Plain-Stanes ” at Aberdeen . Her “ brown , dark hair , and hazel eyes — her very dress , ” were long years after “ a perfect image ” in his memory ( Life , p. 9 ) . Secondly , there was the Mary of these stanzas , “ with long-flowing ringlets of gold , ” the “ Highland Mary ” of local tradition . She was ( writes the Rev . J. Michie , of The Manse , Dinnet ) the daughter of James Robertson , of the farmhouse of Ballatrich on Deeside , where Byron used to spend his summer holidays ( 1796-98 ) . She was of gentle birth , and through her mother , the daughter of Captain Macdonald of Rineton , traced her descent to the Lord of the Isles . “ She died at Aberdeen , March 2 , 1867 , aged eighty-five years . ” A third Mary ( see “ Lines to Mary , ” etc ., p. 32 ) flits through the early poems , evanescent but unspiritual . Last of all , there was Mary Anne Chaworth , of Annesley ( see “ A Fragment , ” etc ., p. 210 ; “ The Adieu , ” st. 6 , p. 239 , etc . ) , whose marriage , in 1805 , “ threw him out again — alone on a wide , wide sea ” ( Life , p. 85 ) .</note>

   <note xml:id="note1_52" place="bottom" n="1">In looking over my papers to select a few additional poems for this second edition , I found the above lines , which I had totally forgotten , composed in the summer of 1805 , a short time previous to my departure from H [ arrow ] . They were addressed to a young schoolfellow of high rank , who had been my frequent companion in some rambles through the neighbouring country : however , he never saw the lines , and most probably never will . As , on a re-perusal , I found them not worse than some other pieces in the collection , I have now published them , for the first time , after a slight revision . [ The foregoing note was prefixed to the poem in ‘ Poems O. and T ’ . George John Frederick , 4th Duke of Dorset , born 1793 , was killed by a fall from his horse when hunting , in 1815 , while on a visit to his step-father the Earl of Whitworth , Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland .

   <note xml:id="note1_55" place="bottom" n="1">On the death of his daughter , Allegra , in April , 1822 , Byron sent her remains to be buried at Harrow , “ where , ” he says , in a letter to Murray , “ I once hoped to have laid my own . ” “ There is , ” he wrote , May 26 , “ a spot in the church'yard ’ , near the footpath , on the brow of the hill looking towards Windsor , and a tomb under a large tree ( bearing the name of Peachie , or Peachey ) , where I used to sit for hours and hours when a boy . This was my favourite spot ; but as I wish to erect a tablet to her memory , the body had better be deposited in the ‘ church ’ . ” No tablet was , however , erected , and Allegra sleeps in her unmarked grave inside the church , a few feet to the right of the entrance .</note>

The stanzas were first published in Moore 's Letters and Journals of Lord Byron , 1830 , i . 56 . ( See , too , The Dream , st. ii . 1 . 9 . ) The original MS. ( which is in the possession of Mrs. Chaworth Musters ) formerly belonged to Miss E. B. Pigot , according to whom they “ were written by Lord Byron in 1804 . ” “ We were reading Burns ’ Farewell to Ayrshire —</note>

   <p>On the fly-leaf of the same volume ( Poetry of Robert Burns , vol . iv . Third Edition , 1802 ) , containing the Farewell to Ayrshire , Byron wrote in pencil the two stanzas “ Oh ! little lock of golden hue , ” in 1806 ( vide post , p. 233 ) .</p>
   <p>It may be noted that the verses quoted , though included until recently among his poems , were not written by Burns , but by Richard Gall , who died in 1801 , aged 25 . ]</p>

   <p>There can be little doubt that these verses were called forth by the criticisms passed on the “ Fugitive Pieces ” by certain ladies of Southwell , concerning whom , Byron wrote to Mr. Pigot ( Jan. 13 , 1807 ) , on sending him an early copy of the ‘ Poems ’ ,</p>
   <p>“ That ‘ unlucky ’ poem to my poor Mary has been the cause of some animadversion from ‘ ladies in years ’ . I have not printed it in this collection in consequence of my being pronounced a most ‘ profligate sinner ’ , in short a ‘'young Moore'’ ”</p>

     <l n="1">‘ Twas now the noon of night , and all was still ,</l>
     <l n="2">Except a hapless Rhymer and his quill .</l>
     <l n="3">In vain he calls each Muse in order down ,</l>
     <l n="4">Like other females , these will sometimes frown ;</l>
     <l n="5">He frets , be fumes , and ceasing to invoke</l>
     <l n="6">The Nine , in anguish 'd accents thus he spoke :</l>
     <l n="7">Ah what avails it thus to waste my time ,</l>
     <l n="8">To roll in Epic , or to rave in Rhyme ?</l>
     <l n="9">What worth is some few partial readers ’ praise .</l>
     <l n="10">If ancient Virgins croaking ‘ censures ’ raise ?</l>
     <l n="11">Where few attend , ‘ tis useless to indite ;</l>
     <l n="12">Where few can read , ‘ tis folly sure to write ;</l>
     <l n="13">Where none but girls and striplings dare admire ,</l>
     <l n="14">And Critics rise in every country Squire —</l>
     <l n="15">But yet this last my candid Muse admits ,</l>
     <l n="16">When Peers are Poets , Squires may well be Wits ;</l>
     <l n="17">When schoolboys vent their amorous flames in verse ,</l>
     <l n="18">Matrons may sure their characters asperse ;</l>
     <l n="19">And if a little parson joins the train ,</l>
     <l n="20">And echos back his Patron 's voice again —</l>
     <l n="21">Though not delighted , yet I must forgive ,</l>
     <l n="22">Parsons as well as other folks must live :—</l>
     <l n="23">From rage he rails not , rather say from dread ,</l>
     <l n="24">He does not speak for Virtue , but for bread ;</l>
     <l n="25">And this we know is in his Patron 's giving ,</l>
     <l n="26">For Parsons cannot eat without a ‘ Living ’ .</l>
     <l n="27">The Matron knows I love the Sex too well ,</l>
     <l n="28">Even unprovoked aggression to repel .</l>
     <l n="29">What though from private pique her anger grew ,</l>
     <l n="30">And bade her blast a heart she never knew ?</l>
     <l n="31">What though , she said , for one light heedless line ,</l>
     <l n="32">That Wilmot 's<span corresp="#note2_24" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>verse was far more pure than mine !</l>
     <l n="33">In wars like these , I neither fight nor fly ,</l>
     <l n="34">When ‘ dames ’ accuse ‘ tis bootless to deny ;</l>
     <l n="35">Her 's be the harvest of the martial field ,</l>
     <l n="36">I can n't attack , where Beauty forms the shield .</l>
     <l n="37">But when a pert Physician loudly cries ,</l>
     <l n="38">Who hunts for scandal , and who lives by lies ,</l>
     <l n="39">A walking register of daily news ,</l>
     <l n="40">Train 'd to invent , and skilful to abuse —</l>
     <l n="41">For arts like these at bounteous tables fed ,</l>
     <l n="42">When S —— condemns a book he never read .</l>
     <l n="43">Declaring with a coxcomb 's native air ,</l>
     <l n="44">The ‘ moral 's ’ shocking , though the ‘ rhymes ’ are fair .</l>
     <l n="45">Ah ! must he rise unpunish 'd from the feast ,</l>
     <l n="46">Nor lash 'd by vengeance into truth at least ?</l>
     <l n="47">Such lenity were more than Man 's indeed !</l>
     <l n="48">Those who condemn , should surely deign to read .</l>
     <l n="49">Yet must I spare — nor thus my pen degrade ,</l>
     <l n="50">I quite forgot that scandal was his trade .</l>
     <l n="51">For food and raiment thus the coxcomb rails ,</l>
     <l n="52">For those who fear his physic , like his tales .</l>
     <l n="53">Why should his harmless censure seem offence ?</l>
     <l n="54">Still let him eat , although at my expense ,</l>
     <l n="55">And join the herd to Sense and Truth unknown ,</l>
     <l n="56">Who dare not call their very thoughts their own ,</l>
     <l n="57">And share with these applause , a godlike bribe ,</l>
     <l n="58">In short , do anything , except prescribe :—</l>
     <l n="59">For though in garb of Galen he appears ,</l>
     <l n="60">His practice is not equal to his years .</l>
     <l n="61">Without improvement since he first began ,</l>
     <l n="62">A young Physician , though an ancient Man —</l>
     <l n="63">Now let me cease — Physician , Parson , Dame ,</l>
     <l n="64">Still urge your task , and if you can , defame .</l>
     <l n="65">The humble offerings of my Muse destroy ,</l>
     <l n="66">And crush , oh ! noble conquest ! crush a Boy .</l>
     <l n="67">What though some silly girls have lov 'd the strain ,</l>
     <l n="68">And kindly bade me tune my Lyre again ;</l>
     <l n="69">What though some feeling , or some partial few ,</l>

     <l n="71">Have deign 'd to praise the firstlings of my Muse —</l>

     <l n="73">If you your great protection still withdraw ,</l>
     <l n="74">Whose Praise is Glory , and whose Voice is law !</l>
     <l n="75">Soon must I fall an unresisting foe ,</l>
     <l n="76">A hapless victim yielding to the blow .—</l>

    <note xml:id="note1_65" place="bottom" n="1">“ Stanzas to Jessy ” have often been printed , but were never acknowledged by Byron , or included in any authorized edition of his works . They are , however , unquestionably genuine . They appeared first in ‘ Monthly Literary Recreations ’ ( July , 1807 ) , a magazine published by B. Crosby &amp; Co ., Stationers ’ Court . Crosby was London agent for Ridge , the Newark bookseller , and , with Longman and others , “ sold ” the recently issued ‘ Hours of Idleness ’ . The same number of ‘ Monthly Literary Recreations ’ ( for July , 1807 ) contains Byron 's review of Wordsworth 's ‘ Poems ’ ( 2 vols ., 1807 ) , and a highly laudatory notice of ‘ Hours of Idleness ’ . The lines are headed “ Stanzas to Jessy , ” and are signed “ George Gordon , Lord Byron . ” They were republished in 1824 , by Knight and Lacy , in vol . v. of the three supplementary volumes of the ‘ Works ’ , and again in the same year by John Bumpus and A. Griffin , in their ‘ Miscellaneous Poems ’ , etc . A note which is prefixed to these issues , “ The following stanzas were addressed by Lord Byron to his Lady , a few months before their separation , ” and three variants in the text , make it unlikely that the pirating editors were acquainted with the text of the magazine . The MS. ( ‘ British Museum ’ , Eg . MSS . No . 2332 ) is signed “ George Gordon , Lord Byron , ” but the words “ George Gordon , Lord ” are in another hand , and were probably added by Crosby . The following letter ( together with a wrapper addressed , “ Mr. Crosby , Stationers ’ Court , ” and sealed in red wax with Byron 's arms and coronet ) is attached to the poem :—</note>

   <p>“ To an oak in the garden of Newstead Abbey , planted by the author in the 9th year of [ his ] age ; this tree at his last visit was in a state of decay , though perhaps not irrecoverable . ”</p>
   <p>On arriving at Newstead , in 1798 , Byron , then in his eleventh year , planted an oak , and cherished the fancy , that as the tree flourished so should he . On revisiting the abbey , he found the oak choked up by weeds and almost destroyed ;— hence these lines . Shortly after Colonel Wildman took possession , he said to a servant ,</p>
   <p>“ Here is a fine young oak ; but it must be cut down , as it grows in an improper place . ”</p>

   <p>“ I saw Lord B. was flattered by John Becher 's lines , as he read ‘ Apollo ’ , etc ., with a peculiar smile and emphasis ; so out of fun , to vex him a little , I said ,</p>
   <p>‘ Apollo ! He should have said Apollyon . ’</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Hail ! generous youth , whom glory 's sacred flame</l>
     <l n="2">Inspires , and animates to deeds of fame ;</l>
     <l n="3">Who feel the noble wish before you die</l>
     <l n="4">To raise the finger of each passer-by :</l>
     <l n="5">Hail ! may a future age admiring view</l>
     <l n="6">A Falkland or a Clarendon in you .</l>
     <l n="7">But as your blood with dangerous passion boils ,</l>
     <l n="8">Beware ! and fly from Venus ’ silken toils :</l>
     <l n="9">Ah ! let the head protect the weaker heart ,</l>
     <l n="10">And Wisdom 's Ægis turn on Beauty 's dart .</l>

     <l n="13">Lose not your pains , and scour the country round ,</l>
     <l n="14">To find a treasure that can ne'er be found !</l>
     <l n="15">No ! take the first the town or court affords ,</l>
     <l n="16">Trick 'd out to stock a market for the lords ;</l>
     <l n="17">By chance perhaps your luckier choice may fall</l>

     <l n="24">Not farther much from comfort than from strife ;</l>

     <l n="29">Some hours of freedom may remain as yet ,</l>
     <l n="30">For one who laughs alike at love and debt :</l>

I accordingly sent it to town , and it returned with a very high polish , and of a mottled colour like tortoiseshell . ” — Medwin 's ‘ Conversations ’ , 1824 , p. 87 .</note>

     <l n="12">And died at Newstead Abbey , Nov. 18 , 1808 . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Byron thus announced the death of his favourite to his friend Hodgson :— “ Boatswain is dead !— he expired in a state of madness on the 18th after suffering much , yet retaining all the gentleness of his nature to the last ; never attempting to do the least injury to any one near him . I have now lost everything except old Murray . ” In the will which the poet executed in 1811 , he desired to be buried in the vault with his dog , and Joe Murray was to have the honour of making one of the party . When the poet was on his travels , a gentleman , to whom Murray showed the tomb , said , “ Well , old boy , you will take your place here some twenty years hence . ” “ I do n't know that , sir , ” replied Joe ; “ if I was sure his lordship would come here I should like it well enough , but I should not like to lie alone with the dog . ” — ‘ Life ’ , pp . 73 , 131 . ]</p>

Her conduct , however , was irreproachable ; but there was not sympathy between their characters . I had not seen her for many years when an occasion offered to me , January , 1814 . I was upon the point , with her consent , of paying her a visit , when my sister , who has always had more influence over me than any one else , persuaded me not to do it . ‘ For , ’ said she , ‘ if you go you will fall in love again , and then there will be a scene ; one step will lead to another , ‘ et cela fera un éclat'’ . ” ]</p>

    <head>A SATIRE .</head>
    <head>BY</head>
    <head>LORD BYRON .</head>
     <l n="1">“ I had rather be a kitten , and cry , mew !</l>
     <l n="2">Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">

   </lg>
   <p>POPE .</p>
   <p>PREFACE<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></p>
   <p>All my friends , learned and unlearned , have urged me not to publish this Satire with my name . If I were to be “ turned from the career of my humour by quibbles quick , and paper bullets of the brain ” I should have complied with their counsel . But I am not to be terrified by abuse , or bullied by reviewers , with or without arms . I can safely say that I have attacked none ‘ personally ’ , who did not commence on the offensive . An Author 's works are public property : he who purchases may judge , and publish his opinion if he pleases ; and the Authors I have endeavoured to commemorate may do by me as I have done by them . I dare say they will succeed better in condemning my scribblings , than in mending their own . But my object is not to prove that I can write well , but , if ‘ possible ’ , to make others write better .</p>
   <p>As the Poem has met with far more success than I expected , I have endeavoured in this Edition to make some additions and alterations , to render it more worthy of public perusal .</p>
   <p>In the First Edition of this Satire , published anonymously , fourteen lines on the subject of Bowles 's Pope were written by , and inserted at the request of , an ingenious friend of mine ,<span corresp="#note2_31" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>who has now in the press a volume of Poetry . In the present Edition they are erased , and some of my own substituted in their stead ; my only reason for this being that which I conceive would operate with any other person in the same manner ,— a determination not to publish with my name any production , which was not entirely and exclusively my own composition .</p>
   <p>With<span corresp="#note3_20" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>regard to the real talents of many of the poetical persons whose performances are mentioned or alluded to in the following pages , it is presumed by the Author that there can be little difference of opinion in the Public at large ; though , like other sectaries , each has his separate tabernacle of proselytes , by whom his abilities are over-rated , his faults overlooked , and his metrical canons received without scruple and without consideration . But the unquestionable possession of considerable genius by several of the writers here censured renders their mental prostitution more to be regretted . Imbecility may be pitied , or , at worst , laughed at and forgotten ; perverted powers demand the most decided reprehension . No one can wish more than the Author that some known and able writer had undertaken their exposure ; but Mr. Gifford has devoted himself to Massinger , and , in the absence of the regular physician , a country practitioner may , in cases of absolute necessity , be allowed to prescribe his nostrum to prevent the extension of so deplorable an epidemic , provided there be no quackery in his treatment of the malady . A caustic is here offered ; as it is to be feared nothing short of actual cautery can recover the numerous patients afflicted with the present prevalent and distressing rabies for rhyming .— As to the ’ Edinburgh Reviewers ’ , it would indeed require an Hercules to crush the Hydra ; but if the Author succeeds in merely “ bruising one of the heads of the serpent ” though his own hand should suffer in the encounter , he will be amply satisfied .</p>
   <note xml:id="note1_87" place="bottom" n="1">The Preface , as it is here printed , was prefixed to the Second , Third , and Fourth Editions of ‘ English Bards , and Scotch Reviewers ’ . The preface to the First Edition began with the words , “ With regard to the real talents , ” etc . The text of the poem follows that of the suppressed Fifth Edition , which passed under Byron 's own supervision , and was to have been issued in 1812 . From that Edition the Preface was altogether excluded .</note>
   <p>In an annotated copy of the Fourth Edition , of 1811 , underneath the note , “ This preface was written for the Second Edition , and printed with it . The noble author had left this country previous to the publication of that Edition , and is not yet returned , ” Byron wrote , in 1816 , “ He is , and gone again . ” — MS. Notes from this volume , which is now in Mr. Murray 's possession , are marked — B ., 1816 . ]</p>

   <p>INTRODUCTION TO ENGLISH BARDS , AND SCOTCH REVIEWERS .</p>
   <p>The article upon ‘ Hours of Idleness ’ “ which Lord Brougham ... after denying it for thirty years , confessed that he had written ” ( ‘ Notes from a Diary ’ , by Sir M. E. Grant Duff , 1897 , ii . 189 ) , was published in the ‘ Edinburgh Review ’ of January , 1808 . ‘ English Bards , and Scotch Reviewers ’ did not appear till March , 1809 . The article gave the opportunity for the publication of the satire , but only in part provoked its composition . Years later , Byron had not forgotten its effect on his mind . On April 26 , 1821 , he wrote to Shelley : “ I recollect the effect on me of the Edinburgh on my first poem : it was rage and resistance and redress : but not despondency nor despair . ” And on the same date to Murray : “ I know by experience that a savage review is hemlock to a sucking author ; and the one on me ( which produced the ‘ English Bards ’ , etc . ) knocked me down , but I got up again , ” etc . It must , however , be remembered that Byron had his weapons ready for an attack before he used them in defence . In a letter to Miss Pigot , dated October 26 , 1807 , he says that “ he has written one poem of 380 lines to be published in a few weeks with notes . The poem ... is a Satire . ” It was entitled ‘ British Bards ’ , and finally numbered 520 lines . With a view to publication , or for his own convenience , it was put up in type and printed in quarto sheets . A single copy , which he kept for corrections and additions , was preserved by Dallas , and is now in the British Museum . After the review appeared , he enlarged and recast the ‘ British Bards ’ , and in March , 1809 , the Satire was published anonymously . Byron was at no pains to conceal the authorship of ‘ English Bards , and Scotch Reviewers ’ , and , before starting on his Pilgrimage , he had prepared a second and enlarged edition , which came out in October , 1809 , with his name prefixed . Two more editions were called for in his absence , and on his return he revised and printed a fifth , when he suddenly resolved to suppress the work . On his homeward voyage he expressed , in a letter to Dallas , June 28 , 1811 , his regret at having written the Satire . A year later he became intimate , among others , with Lord and Lady Holland , whom he had assailed on the supposition that they were the instigators of the article in the ‘ Edinburgh Review ’ , and on being told by Rogers that they wished the Satire to be withdrawn , he gave orders to his publisher , Cawthorn , to burn the whole impression . A few copies escaped the flames . One of two copies retained by Dallas , which afterwards belonged to Murray , and is now in his grandson 's possession , was the foundation of the text of 1831 , and of all subsequent issues . Another copy which belonged to Dallas is retained in the British Museum .</p>
   <p>Towards the close of the last century there had been an outburst of satirical poems , written in the style of the ‘ Dunciad ’ and its offspring the ‘ Rosciad ’ , Of these , Gifford 's ‘ Baviad ’ and ‘ Maviad ’ ( 1794-5 ) , and T. J. Mathias ’ ‘ Pursuits of Literature ’ ( 1794-7 ) , were the direct progenitors of ‘ English Bards , and Scotch Reviewers ’ , The ‘ Rolliad ’ ( 1794 ) , the ‘ Children of Apollo ’ ( circ . 1794 ) , Canning 's ‘ New Morality ’ ( 1798 ) , and Wolcot 's coarse but virile lampoons , must also be reckoned among Byron 's earlier models . The ministry of “ All the Talents ” gave rise to a fresh batch of political ‘ jeux d'ésprits ’ , and in 1807 , when Byron was still at Cambridge , the air was full of these ephemera . To name only a few , ‘ All the Talents ’ , by Polypus ( Eaton Stannard Barrett ) , was answered by ‘ All the Blocks , an antidote to All the Talents ’ , by Flagellum ( W. H. Ireland ) ; ‘ Elijah 's Mantle , a tribute to the memory of the R. H. William Pitt ’ , by James Sayer , the caricaturist , provoked ‘ Melville 's Mantle , being a Parody on ... Elijah 's Mantle ’ . ‘ The Simpliciad , A Satirico-Didactic Poem ’ , and Lady Anne Hamilton 's ‘ Epics of the Ton ’ , are also of the same period . One and all have perished , but Byron read them , and in a greater or less degree they supplied the impulse to write in the fashion of the day .</p>
   <p>‘ British Bards ’ would have lived , but , unquestionably , the spur of the article , a year 's delay , and , above all , the advice and criticism of his friend Hodgson , who was at work on his ‘ Gentle Alterative for the Reviewers ’ , 1809 ( for further details , see vol . i ., ‘ Letters ’ , Letter 102 , ‘ note ’ 1 ) , produced the brilliant success of the enlarged satire . ‘ English Bards , and Scotch Reviewers ’ was recognized at once as a work of genius . It has intercepted the popularity of its great predecessors , who are often quoted , but seldom read . It is still a popular poem , and appeals with fresh delight to readers who know the names of many of the “ bards ” only because Byron mentions them , and count others whom he ridicules among the greatest poets of the century .</p>

William married , in 1805 , Lady Caroline Ponsonby , the writer of ‘ Glenarvon ’ . George , who was one of the early contributors to the ‘ Edinburgh Review ’ , married in 1809 Caroline Rosalie Adelaide St. Jules . At the time of the separation , Lady Caroline Lamb and Mrs. George Lamb warmly espoused Lady Byron 's cause , Lady Melbourne and her daughter Lady Cowper ( afterwards Lady Palmerston ) were rather against than for Lady Byron . William Lamb was discreetly silent , and George Lamb declaimed against Lady Byron , calling her a d —— d fool . Hence Lord Byron 's praises of George . Cf . line 517 of ‘ English Bards ’ .</note>

   <note>Francis Jeffrey ( 1773-1850 ) founded the ‘ Edinburgh Review ’ in conjunction with Sydney Smith , Brougham , and Francis Horner , in 1802 . In 1803 he succeeded Smith as editor , and conducted the ‘ Review ’ till 1829 . Independence of publishers and high pay to contributors ( “ Ten guineas a sheet , ” writes Southey to Scott , June , 1807 , “ instead of seven pounds for the ‘ Annual ’ , ” ‘ Life and Corr ’ ., iii . 125 ) distinguished the new journal from the first . Jeffrey was called to the Scottish bar in 1794 , and as an advocate was especially successful with juries . He was constantly employed , and won fame and fortune . In 1829 he was elected Dean of the Faculty of Advocates , and the following year , when the Whigs came into office , he became Lord Advocate . He sat as M. P . twice for Malton ( 1830-1832 ) , and , afterwards , for Edinburgh . In 1834 he was appointed a Judge of the Court of Sessions , when he took the title of Lord Jeffrey . Byron had attacked Jeffrey in British Bards before his ‘ Hours of Idleness ’ had been cut up by the ‘ Edinburgh ’ , and when the article appeared ( Jan. 1808 ) , under the mistaken impression that he was the author , denounced him at large ( ll . 460-528 ) in the first edition of ‘ English Bards , and Scotch Reviewers ’ . None the less , the great critic did not fail to do ample justice to the poet 's mature work , and won from him repeated acknowledgments of his kindness and generosity .

   <note xml:id="note13_3" place="bottom" n="13">William Gifford ( 1756-1826 ) , a self-taught scholar , first a ploughboy , then boy on board a Brixham coaster , afterwards shoemaker 's apprentice , was sent by friends to Exeter College , Oxford ( 1779-81 ) . In the ‘ Baviad ’ ( 1794 ) and the ‘ Maeviad ’ ( 1795 ) he attacked many of the smaller writers of the day , who were either silly , like the Della Cruscan School , or discreditable , like Williams , who wrote as “ Anthony Pasquin . ” In his ‘ Epistle to Peter Pindar ’ ( 1800 ) he laboured to expose the true character of John Wolcot . As editor of the ‘ Anti-Jacobin , or Weekly Examiner ’ ( November , 1797 , to July , 1798 ) , he supported the political views of Canning and his friends . As editor of the ‘ Quarterly Review ’ , from its foundation ( February , 1809 ) to his resignation in September , 1824 , he soon rose to literary eminence by his sound sense and adherence to the best models , though his judgments were sometimes narrow-minded and warped by political prejudice . His editions of ‘ Massinger ’ ( 1805 ) , which superseded that of Monck Mason and Davies ( 1765 ) , of ‘ Ben Jonson ’ ( 1816 ) , of ‘ Ford ’ ( 1827 ) , are valuable . To his translation of ‘ Juvenal ’ ( 1802 ) is prefixed his autobiography . His translation of ‘ Persius ’ appeared in 1821 . To Gifford , Byron usually paid the utmost deference . “ Any suggestion of yours , even if it were conveyed , ” he writes to him , in 1813 , “ in the less tender text of the ‘ Baviad ’ , or a Monck Mason note to Massinger , would be obeyed . ” See also his letter ( September 20 , 1821 , ‘ Life ’ , p. 531 ): “ I know no praise which would compensate me in my own mind for his censure . ” Byron was attracted to Gifford , partly by his devotion to the classical models of literature , partly by the outspoken frankness of his literary criticism , partly also , perhaps , by his physical deformity .</note>
   <note xml:id="note14_3" place="bottom" n="14">Henry James Pye ( 1745-1813 ) , M. P . for Berkshire , and afterwards Police Magistrate for Westminster , held the office of poet laureate from 1790 till his death in 1813 , succeeding Thomas Warton , and succeeded by Southey . He published ‘ Farringdon Hill ’ in 1774 , The ‘ Progress of Refinement ’ in 1783 , and a translation of Burger 's ‘ Lenore ’ in 1795 . His name recurs in the ‘ Vision of Judgment ’ , stanza xcii . Lines 97-102 were inserted in the Fifth Edition .</note>
   <note xml:id="note15_2" place="bottom" n="15">The first edition of the Satire opened with this line ; and Byron 's original intention was to prefix the following argument , first published in ‘ Recollections ’ , by R. C. Dallas ( 1824 ):—</note>
   <p>“ ARGUMENT .</p>
   <p>“ The poet considereth times past , and their poesy — makes a sudden transition to times present — is incensed against book-makers — revileth Walter Scott for cupidity and ballad-mongering , with notable remarks on Master Southey — complaineth that Master Southey had inflicted three poems , epic and otherwise , on the public — inveigheth against William Wordsworth , but laudeth Mister Coleridge and his elegy on a young ass — is disposed to vituperate Mr. Lewis — and greatly rebuketh Thomas Little ( the late ) and Lord Strangford — recommendeth Mr. Hayley to turn his attention to prose — and exhorteth the Moravians to glorify Mr. Grahame — sympathiseth with the Rev . [ William Bowles ] — and deploreth the melancholy fate of James Montgomery — breaketh out into invective against the Edinburgh Reviewers — calleth them hard names , harpies and the like — apostrophiseth Jeffrey , and prophesieth .— Episode of Jeffrey and Moore , their jeopardy and deliverance ; portents on the morn of the combat ; the Tweed , Tolbooth , Firth of Forth [ and Arthur 's Seat ] , severally shocked ; descent of a goddess to save Jeffrey ; incorporation of the bullets with his sinciput and occiput .— Edinburgh Reviews ‘ en masse ’ .— Lord Aberdeen , Herbert , Scott , Hallam , Pillans , Lambe , Sydney Smith , Brougham , etc .— Lord Holland applauded for dinners and translations .— The Drama ; Skeffington , Hook , Reynolds , Kenney , Cherry , etc .— Sheridan , Colman , and Cumberland called upon [ requested , MS .] to write .— Return to poesy — scribblers of all sorts — lords sometimes rhyme ; much better not — Hafiz , Rosa Matilda , and X. Y. Z .— Rogers , Campbell , Gifford , etc . true poets — Translators of the Greek Anthology — Crabbe — Darwin 's style — Cambridge — Seatonian Prize — Smythe — Hodgson — Oxford — Richards — Poetaloquitur — Conclusion . ” ]</p>

But it is almost certain that he alludes to the “ sublimating gas ” of Dr. Beddoes , which his assistant , Davy , mentions in his ‘ Researches ’ ( 1800 ) as nitrous oxide , and which was used by Southey and Coleridge . The same four “ wonders ” of medical science are depicted in Gillray 's caricatures , November , 1801 , and May and June , 1802 , and are satirized in Christopher Caustic 's ‘ Terrible Tractoration ! A Poetical Petition against Galvanising Trumpery and the Perkinistit Institution ’ ( in 4 cantos , 1803 ) .</note>

The entrance of Thunder and Lightning prologuising to Bayes ’ tragedy [( ‘ vide The Rehearsal ’ ) , ‘ British Bards ’ ] , unfortunately takes away the merit of originality from the dialogue between Messieurs the Spirits of Flood and Fell in the first canto . Then we have the amiable William of Deloraine , “ a stark moss-trooper , ” videlicet , a happy compound of poacher , sheep-stealer , and highwayman .

   <p>The biography of Gilpin Horner , and the marvellous pedestrian page , who travelled twice as fast as his master 's horse , without the aid of seven-leagued boots , are ‘ chefs d'oeuvre ’ in the improvement of taste . For incident we have the invisible , but by no means sparing box on the ear bestowed on the page , and the entrance of a Knight and Charger into the castle , under the very natural disguise of a wain of hay . Marmion , the hero of the latter romance , is exactly what William of Deloraine would have been , had he been able to read and write . The poem was manufactured for Messrs. CONSTABLE , MURRAY , and MILLER , worshipful Booksellers , in consideration of the receipt of a sum of money ; and truly , considering the inspiration , it is a very creditable production . If Mr. SCOTT will write for hire , let him do his best for his paymasters , but not disgrace his genius , which is undoubtedly great , by a repetition of Black-Letter Ballad imitations .</p>

   <note xml:id="note39" place="bottom" n="39">Matthew Gregory Lewis ( 1775-1818 ) , known as “ Monk ” Lewis , was the son of a rich Jamaica planter . During a six months ’ visit to Weimar ( 1792-3 ) , when he was introduced to Goethe , he applied himself to the study of German literature , especially novels and the drama . In 1794 he was appointed ‘ attaché ’ to the Embassy at the Hague , and in the course of ten weeks wrote ‘ Ambrosio , or The Monk ’ , which was published in 1795 . In 1798 he made the acquaintance of Scott , and procured his promise of co-operation in his contemplated ‘ Tales of Terror ’ . In the same year he published the ‘ Castle Spectre ’ ( first played at Drury Lane , Dec. 14 , 1797 ) , in which , to quote the postscript “ To the Reader , ” he meant ( but Sheridan interposed ) “ to have exhibited a whole regiment of Ghosts . ” ‘ Tales of Terror ’ were printed at Weybridge in 1801 , and two or three editions of ‘ Tales of Wonder ’ , to which Byron refers , came out in the same year . Lewis borrowed so freely from all sources that the collection was called “ Tales of Plunder . ” In the first edition ( two vols ., printed by W. Bulmer for the author , 1801 ) the first eighteen poems , with the exception of ‘ The Fire King ’ ( xii . ) by Walter Scott , are by Lewis , either original or translated . Scott also contributed ‘ Glenfinlas , The Eve of St. John , Frederick and Alice , The Wild Huntsmen ( Der Wilde Jäger ) . Southey contributed six poems , including ‘ The Old Woman of Berkeley ’ ( xxiv . ) . ‘ The Little Grey Man ’ ( xix . ) is by H. Bunbury . The second volume is made up from Burns , Gray , Parnell , Glover , Percy 's ‘ Reliques ’ , and other sources .</note>

   </lg>
   <p>He had been a favourite in society before Byron appeared on the scene , but there is no record of any intimacy or acquaintance before 1813 . When Byron was living at Geneva , Lewis visited the Maison Diodati in August , 1816 , on which occasion he “ translated to him Goethe 's ‘ Faust ’ by word of mouth , ” and drew up a codicil to his will , witnessed by Byron , Shelley , and Polidori , which contained certain humane provisions for the well-being of the negroes on his Jamaica estates . He also visited him at ‘ La Mira ’ in August , 1817 . Byron wrote of him after his death : “ He was a good man , and a clever one , but he was a bore , a damned bore — one may say . But I liked him . ”</p>
   <p>To judge from his letters to his mother and other evidence ( Scott 's testimony , for instance ) , he was a kindly , well-intentioned man , but lacking in humour . When his father condemned the indecency of the ‘ Monk ’ , he assured him “ that he had not the slightest idea that what he was then writing could injure the principles of any human being . ” “ He was , ” said Byron , “ too great a bore to lie , ” and the plea is evidently offered in good faith . As a writer , he is memorable chiefly for his sponsorship of German literature . Scott said of him that he had the finest ear for rhythm he ever met with — finer than Byron 's ; and Coleridge , in a letter to Wordsworth , Jan ., 1798 ( ‘ Letters of S. T. C . ’ ( 1895 ) , i . 237 ) , and again in ‘ Table Talk ’ for March 20 , 1834 , commends his verses . Certainly his ballad of “ Crazy Jane , ” once so famous that ladies took to wearing “ Crazy Jane ” hats , is of the nature of poetry . ( See ‘ Life ’ , 349 , 362 , 491 , etc . ; ‘ Life and Correspondence ’ of M. G. Lewis ( 1839 ) , i . 158 , etc . ; ‘ Life of Scott ’ , by J. G. Lockhart ( 1842 ) , pp . 80-83 , 94 . )] ]</p>

   <p>[ Percy Clinton Sydney Smythe , sixth Viscount Strangford ( 1780-1855 ) , published ‘ Translations from the Portuguese by Luis de Camoens ’ in 1803 . The note to which Byron refers is on the canzonet ‘ Naö sei quem assella ’ , “ Thou hast an eye of tender blue . ” It runs thus :</p>
   <p>“ Locks of auburn and eyes of blue have ever been dear to the sons of song .... Sterne even considers them as indicative of qualities the most amiable .... The Translator does not wish to deem ... this unfounded . He is , however , aware of the danger to which such a confession exposes him — but he flies for protection to the temple of AUREA VENUS . ”</p>

He was brought into notice by S. J. Pratt ( who published Blacket 's ‘ Remains ’ in 1811 ) , and was befriended by the Milbanke family . Miss Milbanke , afterwards Lady Byron , wrote ( Sept. 2 , 1809 ) , “ Seaham is at present the residence of a poet , by name Joseph Blacket , one of the Burns-like and Dermody kind , whose genius is his sole possession . I was yesterday in his company for the first time , and was much pleased with his manners and conversation . He is extremely diffident , his deportment is mild , and his countenance animated melancholy and of a satirical turn . His poems certainly display a superior genius and an enlarged mind .... ” Blacket died on the Seaham estate in Sept ., 1810 , at the age of twenty-three .

I do not think that personal differences sanction the unjust condemnation of a brother scribbler ; but I see no reason why they should act as a preventive , when the author , noble or ignoble , has , for a series of years , beguiled a “ discerning public ” ( as the advertisements have it ) with divers reams of most orthodox , imperial nonsense . Besides , I do not step aside to vituperate the earl : no — his works come fairly in review with those of other Patrician Literati . If , before I escaped from my teens , I said anything in favour of his Lordship 's paper books , it was in the way of dutiful dedication , and more from the advice of others than my own judgment , and I seize the first opportunity of pronouncing my sincere recantation .

   <note>Note .— An unfortunate young person of Emanuel College , Cambridge , ycleped Hewson Clarke , has lately manifested the most rabid symptoms of confirmed Authorship . His Disorder commenced some years ago , and the ‘ Newcastle Herald ’ teemed with his precocious essays , to the great edification of the Burgesses of Newcastle , Morpeth , and the parts adjacent even unto Berwick upon Tweed . These have since been abundantly scurrilous upon the [ town ] of Newcastle , his native spot , Mr. Mathias and Anacreon Moore . What these men had done to offend Mr. Hewson Clarke is not known , but surely the town in whose markets he had sold meat , and in whose weekly journal he had written prose deserved better treatment . Mr. H. C. should recollect the proverb “ ‘ tis a villainous bird that defiles his own nest . ” He now writes in the ‘ Satirist ’ . We recommend the young man to abandon the magazines for mathematics , and to believe that a high degree at Cambridge will be more advantageous , as well as profitable in the end , than his present precarious gleanings .</note>
   <p>[ Hewson Clarke ( 1787-circ . 1832 ) was entered at Emmanuel Coll . Camb . circ . 1806 ( see ‘ Postscript ’ ) . He had to leave the University without taking a degree , and migrated to London , where he devoted his not inconsiderable talents to contributions to the ‘ Satirist ’ , the ‘ Scourge ’ , etc . He also wrote : ‘ An Impartial History of the Naval , etc ., Events of Europe ... from the French Revolution ... to the Conclusion of a General Peace ’ ( 1815 ) ; and a continuation of Hume 's ‘ History of England ’ , 2 vols . ( 1832 ) .</p>
   <p>The ‘ Satirist ’ , a monthly magazine illustrated with coloured cartoons , was issued 1808-1814 . ‘ Hours of Idleness ’ was reviewed Jan. 1808 ( i . 77-81 ) . “ The Diary of a Cantab ” ( June , 1808 , ii . 368 ) contains some verses of “ Lord B —— n to his Bear . To the tune of Lachin y gair . ” The last verse runs thus :—</p>

     <l n="3">And weep for thy bondage , so truly discerning</l>
     <l n="4">What 's felt by a ‘ Lord ’ , may be felt by a ‘ Bear ’ . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In August , 1808 ( iii . 78-86 ) , there is a critique on ‘ Poems Original and Translated ’ , in which the bear plays many parts . The writer “ is without his bear and is himself muzzled , ” etc . Towards the close of the article a solemn sentence is passed on the author for his disregard of the advice of parents , tutors , friends ; “ but , ” adds the reviewer , “ in the paltry volume before us we think we observe some proof that the still small voice of conscience will be heard in the cool of the day . Even now the gay , the gallant , the accomplished bear-leader is not happy , ” etc . Hence the castigation of “ the sizar of Emmanuel College . ” ]</p>

   <note>POSTSCRIPT TO THE SECOND EDITION . I have been informed , since the present edition went to the press , that my trusty and well-beloved cousins , the Edinburgh Reviewers , are preparing a most vehement critique on my poor , gentle , ‘ unresisting ’ Muse , whom they have already so be-deviled with their ungodly ribaldry ; “ Tantæne animis coelestibus Iræ ! ” I suppose I must say of JEFFREY as Sir ANDREW AGUECHEEK saith , “ an I had known he was so cunning of fence , I had seen him damned ere I had fought him . ” What a pity it is that I shall be beyond the Bosphorus before the next number has passed the Tweed ! But I yet hope to light my pipe with it in Persia .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>My Northern friends have accused me , with justice , of personality towards their great literary Anthropophagus , Jeffery ; but what else was to be done with him and his dirty pack , who feed by “ lying and slandering , ” and slake their thirst by “ evil speaking ” ? I have adduced facts already well known , and of JEFFREY 's mind I have stated my free opinion , nor has he thence sustained any injury :— what scavenger was ever soiled by being pelted with mud ? It may be said that I quit England because I have censured there “ persons of honour and wit about town ; ” but I am coming back again , and their vengeance will keep hot till my return . Those who know me can testify that my motives for leaving England are very different from fears , literary or personal : those who do not , may one day be convinced . Since the publication of this thing , my name has not been concealed ; I have been mostly in London , ready to answer for my transgressions , and in daily expectation of sundry cartels ; but , alas ! “ the age of chivalry is over , ” or , in the vulgar tongue , there is no spirit now-a-days . There is a youth ycleped Hewson Clarke ( subaudi ‘ esquire ’ ) , a sizer of Emanuel College , and , I believe , a denizen of Berwick-upon-Tweed , whom I have introduced in these pages to much better company than he has been accustomed to meet ; he is , notwithstanding , a very sad dog , and for no reason that I can discover , except a personal quarrel with a bear , kept by me at Cambridge to sit for a fellowship , and whom the jealousy of his Trinity contemporaries prevented from success , has been abusing me , and , what is worse , the defenceless innocent above mentioned , in the ‘ Satirist ’ for one year and some months . I am utterly unconscious of having given him any provocation ; indeed , I am guiltless of having heard his name , till coupled with the ‘ Satirist ’ . He has therefore no reason to complain , and I dare say that , like Sir Fretful Plagiary , he is rather ‘ pleased ’ than otherwise . I have now mentioned all who have done me the honour to notice me and mine , that is , my bear and my book , except the editor of the ‘ Satirist ’ , who , it seems , is a gentleman — God wot ! I wish he could impart a little of his gentility to his subordinate scribblers . I hear that Mr. JERNINGHAM<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>is about to take up the cudgels for his Mæcenas , Lord Carlisle . I hope not : he was one of the few , who , in the very short intercourse I had with him , treated me with kindness when a boy ; and whatever he may say or do , “ pour on , I will endure . ” I have nothing further to add , save a general note of thanksgiving to readers , purchasers , and publishers , and , in the words of SCOTT , I wish “ To all and each a fair good night , And rosy dreams and slumbers light . ” [ Footnote 1 : The article never appeared , and Lord Byron , in the ‘ Hints from Horace ’ , taunted Jeffrey with a silence which seemed to indicate that the critic was beaten from the field . ] [ Footnote 2 : Edward Jerningham ( 1727-1812 ) , third son of Sir George Jerningham , Bart ., was an indefatigable versifier . Between the publication of his first poem , ‘ The Nunnery ’ , in 1766 , and his last , ‘ The Old Bard 's Farewell ’ , in 1812 , he sent to the press no less than thirty separate compositions . As a contributor to the ‘ British Album ’ , Gifford handled him roughly in the ‘ Baviad ’ ( lines 21 , 22 ) ; and Mathias , in a note to ‘ Pursuits of Literature ’ , brackets him with Payne Knight as “ ecrivain du commun et poëte vulgaire . ” He was a dandy with a literary turn , who throughout a long life knew every one who was worth knowing . Some of his letters have recently been published ( see ‘ Jerningham Letters ’ , two vols ., 1896 ) . ] HINTS FROM HORACE : [ i ] BEING AN ALLUSION IN ENGLISH VERSE TO THE EPISTLE “ AD PISONES , DE ARTE POETICÂ , ” AND INTENDED AS A SEQUEL TO “ ENGLISH BARDS , AND SCOTCH REVIEWERS . ” —— “ Ergo fungar vice cotis , acutum Reddere quæ ferrum valet , exsors ipsa secandi . ” HOR . ‘ De Arte Poet ’ ., II . 304 and 305 . “ Rhymes are difficult things — they are stubborn things , Sir . ” FIELDING 'S ‘ Amelia ’ , Vol . iii . Book ; and Chap . v. [ Footnote i : Hints from Horace ( Athens , Capuchin Convent , March 12 , 1811 ) ; being an Imitation in English Verse from the Epistle , etc . [ MS , M .] Hints from Horace : being a Partial Imitation , in English Verse , of the Epistle ‘ Ad Pisones , De Arte Poeticâ ’ ; and intended as a sequel to ‘ English Bards , and Scotch Reviewers ’ . Athens , Franciscan Convent , March 12 , 1811 . [ ‘ Proof b ’ . ]] INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE Three MSS . of ‘ Hints from Horace ’ are extant , two in the possession of Lord Lovelace ( MSS . L. a and b ) , and a third in the possession of Mr. Murray ( ‘ MS. M ’ . ) . Proofs of lines 173-272 and 1-272 ( ‘ Proofs a , b ’ ) , are among the Egerton MSS . in the British Museum . They were purchased from the Rev . Alexander Dallas , January 12 , 1867 , and are , doubtless , fragments of the proofs set up in type for Cawthorn in 1811 . They are in “ book-form , ” and show that the volume was intended to be uniform with the Fifth Edition of ‘ English Bards , and Scotch Reviewers ’ , of 1811 . The text corresponds closely but not exactly with that adopted by Murray in 1831 , and does not embody the variants of the several MSS . It is probable that complete proofs were in Moore 's possession at the time when he included the selections from the ‘ Hints ’ in his ‘ Letters and Journals ’ , pp . 263-269 , and that the text of the entire poem as published in 1831 was derived from this source . Selections , numbering in all 156 lines , had already appeared in ‘ Recollections of the Life of Lord Byron ’ , by R. C. Dallas , 1824 , pp . 104-113 . Byron , estimating the merit by the difficulty of the performance , rated the ‘ Hints from Horace ’ extravagantly high . He only forbore to publish them after the success of ‘ Childe Harold ’ , because he felt , as he states , that he should be “ heaping coals of fire upon his head ” if he were in his hour of triumph to put forth a sequel to a lampoon provoked by failure . Nine years afterwards , when he resolved to print the work with some omissions , he gravely maintained that it excelled the productions of his mature genius . “ As far , ” he said , “ as versification goes , it is good ; and on looking back at what I wrote about that period , I am astonished to see how little I have trained on . I wrote better then than now ; but that comes of my having fallen into the atrocious bad taste of the times ” [ September 23 , 1820 ] . The opinion of J. C. Hobhouse that the ‘ Hints ’ would require “ a good deal of slashing ” to adapt them to the passing hour , and other considerations , again led Byron to suspend the publication . Authors are frequently bad judges of their own works , but of all the literary hallucinations upon record there are none which exceed the mistaken preferences of Lord Byron . Shortly after the appearance of ‘ The Corsair ’ he fancied that ‘ English Bards ’ was still his masterpiece ; when all his greatest works had been produced , he contended that his translation from Pulci was his “ grand performance ,— the best thing he ever did in his life ; ” and throughout the whole of his literary career he regarded these ‘ Hints from Horace ’ with a special and unchanging fondness . HINTS FROM HORACE ATHENS : CAPUCHIN CONVENT , March . 12 , 1811 . [ i ] Who would not laugh , if Lawrence<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>, hired to grace [ ii ] His costly canvas with each flattered face , Abused his art , till Nature , with a blush , Saw cits grow Centaurs underneath his brush ? Or , should some limner join , for show or sale , A Maid of Honour to a Mermaid 's tail ? [ iii ] Or low Dubost<span corresp="#note2_33" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>— as once the world has seen — Degrade God 's creatures in his graphic spleen ? Not all that forced politeness , which defends Fools in their faults , could gag his grinning friends . 10 Believe me , Moschus , like that picture seems [ iv ] The book which , sillier than a sick man 's dreams , Displays a crowd of figures incomplete , Poetic Nightmares , without head or feet . Poets and painters , as all artists know , [ v ] May shoot a little with a lengthened bow ; We claim this mutual mercy for our task , And grant in turn the pardon which we ask ; But make not monsters spring from gentle dams — Birds breed not vipers , tigers nurse not lambs . 20 A laboured , long Exordium , sometimes tends ( Like patriot speeches ) but to paltry ends ; [ vi ] And nonsense in a lofty note goes down , As Pertness passes with a legal gown : [ vii ] Thus many a Bard describes in pompous strain [ viii ] The clear brook babbling through the goodly plain : The groves of Granta , and her Gothic halls , King 's Coll-Cam 's stream-stained windows , and old walls : Or , in adventurous numbers , neatly aims To paint a rainbow , or the river Thames .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>30 You sketch a tree , and so perhaps may shine [ ix ] — But daub a shipwreck like an alehouse sign ; You plan a vase — it dwindles to a pot ; Then glide down Grub-street — fasting and forgot : Laughed into Lethe by some quaint Review , Whose wit is never troublesome till — true . In fine , to whatsoever you aspire , Let it at least be simple and entire . The greater portion of the rhyming tribe [ x ] ( Give ear , my friend , for thou hast been a scribe ) 40 Are led astray by some peculiar lure . [ xi ] I labour to be brief — become obscure ; One falls while following Elegance too fast ; Another soars , inflated with Bombast ; Too low a third crawls on , afraid to fly , He spins his subject to Satiety ; Absurdly varying , he at last engraves Fish in the woods , and boars beneath the waves ! [ xii ] Unless your care 's exact , your judgment nice , The flight from Folly leads but into Vice ; 50 None are complete , all wanting in some part , Like certain tailors , limited in art . For galligaskins Slowshears is your man [ xiii ] But coats must claim another artisan .<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>Now this to me , I own , seems much the same As Vulcan 's feet to bear Apollo 's frame ; Or , with a fair complexion , to expose Black eyes , black ringlets , but — a bottle nose ! Dear Authors ! suit your topics to your strength , And ponder well your subject , and its length ; 60 Nor lift your load , before you 're quite aware What weight your shoulders will , or will not , bear . But lucid Order , and Wit 's siren voice , [ xiv ] Await the Poet , skilful in his choice ; With native Eloquence he soars along , Grace in his thoughts , and Music in his song . Let Judgment teach him wisely to combine With future parts the now omitted line : This shall the Author choose , or that reject , Precise in style , and cautious to select ; 70 Nor slight applause will candid pens afford To him who furnishes a wanting word . [ xv ] Then fear not , if ‘ tis needful , to produce Some term unknown , or obsolete in use , ( As Pitt has furnished us a word or two ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>Which Lexicographers declined to do ;) So you indeed , with care ,— ( but be content To take this license rarely ) — may invent . New words find credit in these latter days , If neatly grafted on a Gallic phrase ; [ xvi ] 80 What Chaucer , Spenser did , we scarce refuse To Dryden 's or to Pope 's maturer Muse . If you can add a little , say why not , As well as William Pitt , and Walter Scott ? Since they , by force of rhyme and force of lungs , [ xvii ] Enriched our Island 's ill-united tongues ; ‘ Tis then — and shall be — lawful to present Reform in writing , as in Parliament . As forests shed their foliage by degrees , So fade expressions which in season please ; 90 And we and ours , alas ! are due to Fate , And works and words but dwindle to a date . Though as a Monarch nods , and Commerce calls , [ xviii ] Impetuous rivers stagnate in canals ; Though swamps subdued , and marshes drained , sustain [ xix ] The heavy ploughshare and the yellow grain , And rising ports along the busy shore Protect the vessel from old Ocean 's roar , All , all , must perish ; but , surviving last , The love of Letters half preserves the past . 100 True , some decay , yet not a few revive ; [ xx ]<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>Though those shall sink , which now appear to thrive , As Custom arbitrates , whose shifting sway [ xxi ] Our life and language must alike obey . The immortal wars which Gods and Angels wage , Are they not shown in Milton 's sacred page ? His strain will teach what numbers best belong To themes celestial told in Epic song . [ xxii ] The slow , sad stanza will correctly paint The Lover 's anguish , or the Friend 's complaint . 110 But which deserves the Laurel — Rhyme or Blank ? [ xxiii ] Which holds on Helicon the higher rank ? Let squabbling critics by themselves dispute This point , as puzzling as a Chancery suit . Satiric rhyme first sprang from selfish spleen . You doubt — see Dryden , Pope , St. Patrick 's Dean .<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>Blank verse is now , with one consent , allied To Tragedy , and rarely quits her side . Though mad Almanzor<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>rhymed in Dryden 's days , No sing-song Hero rants in modern plays ; 120 Whilst modest Comedy her verse foregoes For jest and ‘ pun ’<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>in very middling prose . Not that our Bens or Beaumonts show the worse , Or lose one point , because they wrote in verse . But so Thalia pleases to appear , [ xxiv ] Poor Virgin ! damned some twenty times a year ! Whate'er the scene , let this advice have weight :— Adapt your language to your Hero 's state . At times Melpomene forgets to groan , And brisk Thalia takes a serious tone ; 130 Nor unregarded will the act pass by Where angry Townly<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>“ lifts his voice on high . ” Again , our Shakespeare limits verse to Kings , When common prose will serve for common things ; And lively Hal resigns heroic ire , [ xxv ] — To “ hollaing Hotspur ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>and his sceptred sire . [ xxvi ] ‘ Tis not enough , ye Bards , with all your art , To polish poems ; they must touch the heart : Where'er the scene be laid , whate'er the song , Still let it bear the hearer 's soul along ; 140 Command your audience or to smile or weep , Whiche'er may please you — anything but sleep . The Poet claims our tears ; but , by his leave , Before I shed them , let me see ‘ him ’ grieve . If banished Romeo feigned nor sigh nor tear , Lulled by his languor , I could sleep or sneer . [ xxvii ] Sad words , no doubt , become a serious face , And men look angry in the proper place . At double meanings folks seem wondrous sly , And Sentiment prescribes a pensive eye ; 150 For Nature formed at first the inward man , And actors copy Nature — when they can . She bids the beating heart with rapture bound , Raised to the Stars , or levelled with the ground ; And for Expression 's aid , ‘ tis said , or sung , [ xxviii ] She gave our mind 's interpreter — the tongue , Who , worn with use , of late would fain dispense ( At least in theatres ) with common sense ; O'erwhelm with sound the Boxes , Gallery , Pit , And raise a laugh with anything — but Wit . 160 To skilful writers it will much import , Whence spring their scenes , from common life or Court ; Whether they seek applause by smile or tear , To draw a Lying Valet ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span>or a Lear ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span>A sage , or rakish youngster wild from school , A wandering Peregrine , or plain John Bull ; All persons please when Nature 's voice prevails , Scottish or Irish , born in Wilts or Wales . Or follow common fame , or forge a plot ; [ xxix ] Who cares if mimic heroes lived or not ! 170 One precept serves to regulate the scene : Make it appear as if it might have been . If some Drawcansir<span type="note_anchor">[ 14 ]</span>you aspire to draw , Present him raving , and above all law : If female furies in your scheme are planned , Macbeth 's fierce dame is ready to your hand ; For tears and treachery , for good and evil , Constance , King Richard , Hamlet , and the Devil ! But if a new design you dare essay , And freely wander from the beaten way , 180 True to your characters , till all be past , Preserve consistency from first to last . Tis hard<span type="note_anchor">[ 15 ]</span>to venture where our betters fail , [ xxx ] Or lend fresh interest to a twice-told tale ; And yet , perchance ,' tis wiser to prefer A hackneyed plot , than choose a new , and err ; Yet copy not too closely , but record , More justly , thought for thought than word for word ; Nor trace your Prototype through narrow ways , But only follow where he merits praise . 190 For you , young Bard ! whom luckless fate may lead<span type="note_anchor">[ 16 ]</span>To tremble on the nod of all who read , Ere your first score of cantos Time unrolls , [ xxxi ] Beware — for God 's sake , do n't begin like Bowles ! “ Awake a louder and a loftier strain , ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 17 ]</span>— And pray , what follows from his boiling brain ?— He sinks to Southey 's level in a trice , Whose Epic Mountains never fail in mice ! Not so of yore awoke your mighty Sire The tempered warblings of his master-lyre ; 200 Soft as the gentler breathing of the lute , “ Of Man 's first disobedience and the fruit ” He speaks , but , as his subject swells along , Earth , Heaven , and Hades echo with the song . "[ xxxii ] Still to the “ midst of things ” he hastens on , As if we witnessed all already done ; [ xxxiii ] Leaves on his path whatever seems too mean To raise the subject , or adorn the scene ; Gives , as each page improves upon the sight , Not smoke from brightness , but from darkness — light ; 210 And truth and fiction with such art compounds , We know not where to fix their several bounds . If you would please the Public , deign to hear What soothes the many-headed monster 's ear : [ xxxiv ] If your heart triumph when the hands of all Applaud in thunder at the curtain 's fall , Deserve those plaudits — study Nature 's page , And sketch the striking traits of every age ; While varying Man and varying years unfold Life 's little tale , so oft , so vainly told ; 220 Observe his simple childhood 's dawning days , His pranks , his prate , his playmates , and his plays : Till time at length the mannish tyro weans , And prurient vice outstrips his tardy teens ! [ xxxv ] Behold him Freshman ! forced no more to groan [ xxxvi ] O'er Virgil 's<span type="note_anchor">[ 18 ]</span>devilish verses and his own ; Prayers are too tedious , Lectures too abstruse , He flies from Tavell 's frown to “ Fordham 's Mews ; ” ( Unlucky Tavell !<span type="note_anchor">[ 19 ]</span>doomed to daily cares [ xxxvii ] By pugilistic pupils , and by bears ,) 230 Fines , Tutors , tasks , Conventions threat in vain , Before hounds , hunters , and Newmarket Plain . Rough with his elders , with his equals rash , Civil to sharpers , prodigal of cash ; Constant to nought — save hazard and a whore , [ xxxviii ] Yet cursing both — for both have made him sore : Unread ( unless since books beguile disease , The P —— x becomes his passage to Degrees ) ; Fooled , pillaged , dunned , he wastes his terms away , [ xxxix ] And unexpelled , perhaps , retires M. A . ; 240 Master of Arts ! as hells and clubs<span type="note_anchor">[ 20 ]</span>proclaim , [ xl ] Where scarce a blackleg bears a brighter name ! Launched into life , extinct his early fire , He apes the selfish prudence of his Sire ; Marries for money , chooses friends for rank , Buys land , and shrewdly trusts not to the Bank ; Sits in the Senate ; gets a son and heir ; Sends him to Harrow — for himself was there . Mute , though he votes , unless when called to cheer , His son 's so sharp — he 'll see the dog a Peer ! 250 Manhood declines — Age palsies every limb ; He quits the scene — or else the scene quits him ; Scrapes wealth , o'er each departing penny grieves , [ xli ] And Avarice seizes all Ambition leaves ; Counts cent per cent , and smiles , or vainly frets , O'er hoards diminished by young Hopeful 's debts ; Weighs well and wisely what to sell or buy , Complete in all life 's lessons — but to die ; Peevish and spiteful , doting , hard to please , Commending every time , save times like these ; 260 Crazed , querulous , forsaken , half forgot , Expires unwept — is buried — Let him rot ! But from the Drama let me not digress , Nor spare my precepts , though they please you less . [ xlii ] Though Woman weep , and hardest hearts are stirred , [ xliii ] When what is done is rather seen than heard , Yet many deeds preserved in History 's page Are better told than acted on the stage ; The ear sustains what shocks the timid eye , And Horror thus subsides to Sympathy , 270 True Briton all beside , I here am French — Bloodshed ‘ tis surely better to retrench : The gladiatorial gore we teach to flow In tragic scenes disgusts though but in show ; We hate the carnage while we see the trick , And find small sympathy in being sick . Not on the stage the regicide Macbeth Appals an audience with a Monarch 's death ; [ xliv ] To gaze when sable Hubert threats to sear Young Arthur 's eyes , can ours or Nature bear ? 280 A haltered heroine<span type="note_anchor">[ 21 ]</span>Johnson sought to slay — We saved Irene , but half damned the play , And ( Heaven be praised ! ) our tolerating times Stint Metamorphoses to Pantomimes ; And Lewis ’<span type="note_anchor">[ 22 ]</span>self , with all his sprites , would quake To change Earl Osmond 's negro to a snake ! Because , in scenes exciting joy or grief , We loathe the action which exceeds belief : And yet , God knows ! what may not authors do , Whose Postscripts prate of dyeing “ heroines blue ” ?<span type="note_anchor">[ 23 ]</span>290 Above all things , Dan Poet , if you can , Eke out your acts , I pray , with mortal man , Nor call a ghost , unless some cursed scrape [ xlv ] Must open ten trap-doors for your escape . Of all the monstrous things I 'd fain forbid , I loathe an Opera worse than Dennis did ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 24 ]</span>Where good and evil persons , right or wrong , Rage , love , and aught but moralise — in song . Hail , last memorial of our foreign friends , [ xlvi ] Which Gaul allows , and still Hesperia lends ! 300 Napoleon 's edicts no embargo lay On whores — spies — singers — wisely shipped away . Our giant Capital , whose squares are spread [ xlvii ] Where rustics earned , and now may beg , their bread , In all iniquity is grown so nice , It scorns amusements which are not of price . Hence the pert shopkeeper , whose throbbing ear Aches with orchestras which he pays to hear , [ xlviii ] Whom shame , not sympathy , forbids to snore , His anguish doubling by his own “ encore ; ” [ xlix ] 310 Squeezed in “ Fop 's Alley , ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 25 ]</span>jostled by the beaux , Teased with his hat , and trembling for his toes ; Scarce wrestles through the night , nor tastes of ease , Till the dropped curtain gives a glad release : Why this , and more , he suffers — can ye guess ?— Because it costs him dear , and makes him dress !<span type="note_anchor">[ 26 ]</span>So prosper eunuchs from Etruscan schools ; Give us but fiddlers , and they 're sure of fools ! Ere scenes were played by many a reverend clerk , [ l ]<span type="note_anchor">[ 27 ]</span>( What harm , if David danced before the ark ? ) [ li ] 320 In Christmas revels , simple country folks Were pleased with morrice-mumm'ry and coarse jokes . Improving years , with things no longer known , Produced blithe Punch and merry Madame Joan , Who still frisk on with feats so lewdly low , [ lii ] ‘ Tis strange Benvolio<span type="note_anchor">[ 28 ]</span>suffers such a show ; Suppressing peer ! to whom each vice gives place , [ liii ] Oaths , boxing , begging — all , save rout and race . Farce followed Comedy , and reached her prime , In ever-laughing Foote 's fantastic time :<span type="note_anchor">[ 29 ]</span>330 Mad wag ! who pardoned none , nor spared the best , And turned some very serious things to jest . Nor Church nor State escaped his public sneers , Arms nor the Gown — Priests — Lawyers — Volunteers : “ Alas , poor Yorick ! ” now for ever mute ! Whoever loves a laugh must sigh for Foote . We smile , perforce , when histrionic scenes Ape the swoln dialogue of Kings and Queens , When “ Crononhotonthologos must die , ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 30 ]</span>And Arthur struts in mimic majesty . 340 Moschus ! with whom once more I hope to sit , [ liv ] And smile at folly , if we can n't at wit ; Yes , Friend ! for thee I 'll quit my cynic cell , And bear Swift 's motto , “ Vive la bagatelle ! ” Which charmed our days in each Ægean clime , As oft at home , with revelry and rhyme . Then may Euphrosyne , who sped the past , Soothe thy Life 's scenes , nor leave thee in the last ; But find in thine — like pagan Plato 's bed , [ lv ]<span type="note_anchor">[ 31 ]</span>Some merry Manuscript of Mimes , when dead . 350 Now to the Drama let us bend our eyes , Where fettered by whig Walpole low she lies ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 32 ]</span>Corruption foiled her , for she feared her glance ; Decorum left her for an Opera dance ! Yet Chesterfield ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 33 ]</span>whose polished pen inveighs ‘ Gainst laughter , fought for freedom to our Plays ; Unchecked by Megrims of patrician brains , And damning Dulness of Lord Chamberlains . Repeal that act ! again let Humour roam Wild o'er the stage — we 've time for tears at home ; 360 Let Archer<span type="note_anchor">[ 34 ]</span>plant the horns on Sullen 's brows , And Estifania gull her “ Copper ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 35 ]</span>spouse ; The moral 's scant — but that may be excused , Men go not to be lectured , but amused . He whom our plays dispose to Good or Ill Must wear a head in want of Willis ’ skill ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 36 ]</span>Aye , but Macheath 's example — psha !— no more ! It formed no thieves — the thief was formed before ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 37 ]</span>And spite of puritans and Collier 's curse , [ lvi ] Plays make mankind no better , and no worse .<span type="note_anchor">[ 38 ]</span>370 Then spare our stage , ye methodistic men ! Nor burn damned Drury if it rise again .<span type="note_anchor">[ 39 ]</span>But why to brain-scorched bigots thus appeal ? Can heavenly Mercy dwell with earthly Zeal ? For times of fire and faggot let them hope ! Times dear alike to puritan or Pope . As pious Calvin saw Servetus blaze , So would new sects on newer victims gaze . E'en now the songs of Solyma begin ; Faith cants , perplexed apologist of Sin ! 380 While the Lord 's servant chastens whom he loves , And Simeon kicks ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 40 ]</span>where Baxter only “ shoves . "[ 41 ] Whom Nature guides , so writes , that every dunce [ lvii ] , Enraptured , thinks to do the same at once ; But after inky thumbs and bitten nails [ lviii ] , And twenty scattered quires , the coxcomb fails . Let Pastoral be dumb ; for who can hope To match the youthful eclogues of our Pope ? Yet his and Philips ’<span type="note_anchor">[ 42 ]</span>faults , of different kind , For Art too rude , for Nature too refined , [ lix ] 390 Instruct how hard the medium ‘ tis to hit ‘ Twixt too much polish and too coarse a wit . A vulgar scribbler , certes , stands disgraced In this nice age , when all aspire to taste ; The dirty language , and the noisome jest , Which pleased in Swift of yore , we now detest ; Proscribed not only in the world polite [ lx ] , But even too nasty for a City Knight ! Peace to Swift 's faults ! his wit hath made them pass , Unmatched by all , save matchless Hudibras ! 400 Whose author is perhaps the first we meet , Who from our couplet lopped two final feet ; Nor less in merit than the longer line , This measure moves a favourite of the Nine . Though at first view eight feet may seem in vain Formed , save in Ode , to bear a serious strain [ lxi ] , Yet Scott has shown our wondering isle of late This measure shrinks not from a theme of weight , And , varied skilfully , surpasses far Heroic rhyme , but most in Love and War , 410 Whose fluctuations , tender or sublime , Are curbed too much by long-recurring rhyme . But many a skilful judge abhors to see , What few admire — irregularity . This some vouchsafe to pardon ; but ‘ tis hard When such a word contents a British Bard . And must the Bard his glowing thoughts confine , [ lxii ] Lest Censure hover o'er some faulty line ? Remove whate'er a critic may suspect , To gain the paltry suffrage of “ Correct ” ? 420 Or prune the spirit of each daring phrase , To fly from Error , not to merit Praise ? Ye , who seek finished models , never cease [ lxiii ] , By day and night , to read the works of Greece . But our good Fathers never bent their brains To heathen Greek , content with native strains . The few who read a page , or used a pen , Were satisfied with Chaucer and old Ben ; The jokes and numbers suited to their taste Were quaint and careless , anything but chaste ; 430 Yet , whether right or wrong the ancient rules , It will not do to call our Fathers fools ! Though you and I , who eruditely know To separate the elegant and low , Can also , when a hobbling line appears , Detect with fingers — in default of ears . In sooth I do not know , or greatly care To learn , who our first English strollers were ; Or if , till roofs received the vagrant art , Our Muse , like that of Thespis , kept a cart ; 440 But this is certain , since our Shakespeare 's days , There 's pomp enough — if little else — in plays ; Nor will Melpomene ascend her Throne [ lxiv ] Without high heels , white plume , and Bristol stone . Old Comedies still meet with much applause , Though too licentious for dramatic laws ; At least , we moderns , wisely , ‘ tis confest , Curtail , or silence , the lascivious jest [ lxv ] . Whate'er their follies , and their faults beside , Our enterprising Bards pass nought untried ; 450 Nor do they merit slight applause who choose An English subject for an English Muse , And leave to minds which never dare invent French flippancy and German sentiment . Where is that living language which could claim Poetic more , as philosophic , fame , If all our Bards , more patient of delay , Would stop , like Pope , to polish by the way ?<span type="note_anchor">[ 43 ]</span>Lords of the quill , whose critical assaults O'erthrow whole quartos with their quires of faults [ lxvi ] , 460 Who soon detect , and mark where'er we fail , And prove our marble with too nice a nail ! Democritus himself was not so bad ; He only ‘ thought ’ — but ‘ you ’ would make us — mad ! But truth to say , most rhymers rarely guard Against that ridicule they deem so hard ; In person negligent , they wear , from sloth , Beards of a week , and nails of annual growth ; Reside in garrets , fly from those they meet , And walk in alleys rather than the street . 470 With little rhyme , less reason , if you please , The name of Poet may be got with ease , So that not tuns of helleboric juice [ lxvii ] Shall ever turn your head to any use ; Write but like Wordsworth — live beside a lake , And keep your bushy locks a year from Blake ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 44 ]</span>Then print your book , once more return to town , And boys shall hunt your Bardship up and down .<span type="note_anchor">[ 45 ]</span>Am I not wise , if such some poets ’ plight , To purge in spring — like Bayes<span type="note_anchor">[ 46 ]</span>— before I write ? 480 If this precaution softened not my bile , I know no scribbler with a madder style ; But since ( perhaps my feelings are too nice ) I cannot purchase Fame at such a price , I 'll labour gratis as a grinders ’ wheel , [ lxviii ] And , blunt myself , give edge to other 's steel , Nor write at all , unless to teach the art To those rehearsing for the Poet 's part ; From Horace show the pleasing paths of song , [ lxix ] , And from my own example — what is wrong . 490 Though modern practice sometimes differs quite , ‘ Tis just as well to think before you write ; Let every book that suits your theme be read , So shall you trace it to the fountain-head . He who has learned the duty which he owes To friends and country , and to pardon foes ; Who models his deportment as may best Accord with Brother , Sire , or Stranger-guest ; Who takes our Laws and Worship as they are , Nor roars reform for Senate , Church , and Bar ; 500 In practice , rather than loud precept , wise , Bids not his tongue , but heart , philosophize : Such is the man the Poet should rehearse , As joint exemplar of his life and verse . Sometimes a sprightly wit , and tale well told , Without much grace , or weight , or art , will hold A longer empire o'er the public mind Than sounding trifles , empty , though refined . Unhappy Greece ! thy sons of ancient days The Muse may celebrate with perfect praise , 510 Whose generous children narrowed not their hearts With Commerce , given alone to Arms and Arts . [ lxx ] Our boys ( save those whom public schools compel To “ Long and Short ” before they 're taught to spell ) From frugal fathers soon imbibe by rote , “ A penny saved , my lad , ‘ s a penny got . ” Babe of a city birth ! from sixpence take [ lxxi ] The third , how much will the remainder make ?— “ A groat . ” — “ Ah , bravo !

[ lxxv ] Fiction does best when taught to look like Truth , And fairy fables bubble none but youth : Expect no credit for too wondrous tales , Since Jonas only springs alive from Whales ! 540 Young men with aught but Elegance dispense ; Maturer years require a little Sense .

Parnassian pilgrims ! ye whom chance , or choice , [ lxxx ] Hath led to listen to the Muse 's voice , Receive this counsel , and be timely wise ; Few reach the Summit which before you lies . 580 Our Church and State , our Courts and Camps , concede Reward to very moderate heads indeed !

Presuming that all who can construe may venture an opinion on such subjects , particularly as so many who can n't have taken the same liberty , I should have held “ my farthing candle ” as awkwardly as another , had not my respect for the wits of Louis 14th 's Augustan “ Siècle ” induced me to subjoin these illustrious authorities . I therefore offer : firstly Boileau : “ Il est difficile de trailer des sujets qui sont à la portée de tout le monde d'une maniere qui vous les rende propres , ce qui s'appelle s'approprier un sujet par le tour qu'on y donne . ” 2dly , Batteux : “ Mais il est bien difficile de donner des traits propres et individuels aux etres purement possibles . ” 3dly , Dacier : “ Il est difficile de traiter convenablement ces caractères que tout le monde peut inventer . ” Mr. Sévigné 's opinion and translation , consisting of some thirty pages , I omit , particularly as Mr. Grouvelle observes , “ La chose est bien remarquable , aucune de ces diverses interpretations ne parait être la veritable . ” But , by way of comfort , it seems , fifty years afterwards , “ Le lumineux Dumarsais ” made his appearance , to set Horace on his legs again , “ dissiper tous les nuages , et concilier tous les dissentiments ; ” and I suppose some fifty years hence , somebody , still more luminous , will doubtless start up and demolish Dumarsais and his system on this weighty affair , as if he were no better than Ptolemy or Copernicus and comments of no more consequence than astronomical calculations . I am happy to say , “ la longueur de la dissertation ” of Mr. D. prevents Mr. G. from saying any more on the matter . A better poet than Boileau , and at least as good a scholar as Mr. de Sévigné , has said , “ A little learning is a dangerous thing . ” And by the above extract , it appears that a good deal may be rendered as useless to the Proprietors . [ Byron chose the words in question , Difficile , ’ etc ., as a motto for the first five cantos of ‘ Don Juan ’ ] [ Footnote 16 : About two years ago a young man named Townsend was announced by Mr. Cumberland , in a review ( since deceased ) [ the ‘ London Review ’ ] , as being engaged in an epic poem to be entitled “ Armageddon . ” The plan and specimen promise much ; but I hope neither to offend Mr. Townsend , nor his friends , by recommending to his attention the lines of Horace to which these rhymes allude . If Mr. Townsend succeeds in his undertaking , as there is reason to hope , how much will the world be indebted to Mr. Cumberland for bringing him before the public ! But , till that eventful day arrives , it may be doubted whether the premature display of his plan ( sublime as the ideas confessedly are ) has not ,— by raising expectation too high , or diminishing curiosity , by developing his argument ,— rather incurred the hazard of injuring Mr. Townsend 's future prospects . Mr. Cumberland ( whose talents I shall not depreciate by the humble tribute of my praise ) and Mr. Townsend must not suppose me actuated by unworthy motives in this suggestion . I wish the author all the success he can wish himself , and shall be truly happy to see epic poetry weighed up from the bathos where it lies sunken with Southey , Cottle , Cowley ( Mrs. or Abraham ) , Ogilvy , Wilkie , Pye , and all the “ dull of past and present days . ” Even if he is not a ‘ Milton ’ , he may be better than ‘ Blackmore ’ ; if not a ‘ Homer ’ , an ‘ Antimachus ’ . I should deem myself presumptuous , as a young man , in offering advice , were it not addressed to one still younger . Mr. Townsend has the greatest difficulties to encounter ; but in conquering them he will find employment ; in having conquered them , his reward . I know too well “ the scribbler 's scoff , the critic 's contumely ; ” and I am afraid time will teach Mr. Townsend to know them better . Those who succeed , and those who do not , must bear this alike , and it is hard to say which have most of it . I trust that Mr. Townsend 's share will be from ‘ envy ’ ; he will soon know mankind well enough not to attribute this expression to malice .

Indeed , the public school penance of “ Long and Short ” is enough to beget an antipathy to poetry for the residue of a man 's life , and , perhaps , so far may be an advantage . ] [ Footnote 19 : “ ‘ Infandum , regina , jubes renovare dolorem ’ . ” I dare say Mr. Tavell ( to whom I mean no affront ) will understand me ; and it is no matter whether any one else does or no .— To the above events , “ ‘ quæque ipse miserrima vidi , et quorum pars magna fui ’ , ” all ‘ times ’ and ‘ terms ’ bear testimony .

A literary friend of mine , walking out one lovely evening last summer , on the eleventh bridge of the Paddington canal , was alarmed by the cry of “ one in jeopardy : ” he rushed along , collected a body of Irish haymakers ( supping on butter-milk in an adjacent paddock ) , procured three rakes , one eel-spear and a landing net , and at last ( ‘ horresco referens ’ ) pulled out — his own publisher .

Its “ alacrity of sinking ” was so great , that it has never since been heard of ; though some maintain that it is at this moment concealed at Alderman Birch 's pastry premises , Cornhill . Be this as it may , the coroner 's inquest brought in a verdict of “ ‘ Felo de bibliopolâ ’ ” against a “ quarto unknown ; ” and circumstantial evidence being since strong against ‘ The Curse of Kehama ’ ( of which the above words are an exact description ) , it will be tried by its peers next session , in Grub-street — Arthur , Alfred , Davideis , Richard Coeur de Lion , Exodus , Exodiad , Epigoniad , Calvary , Fall of Cambria , Siege of Acre , Don Roderick , and Tom Thumb the Great , are the names of the twelve jurors .

Poor Southey , it should seem , is the “ Lepidus ” of this poetical triumvirate . I am only surprised to see him in such good company . “ Such things , we know , are neither rich nor rare , But wonder how the devil ‘ he ’ came there . ” The trio are well defined in the sixth proposition of Euclid :— “ Because , in the triangles D B C , A C B ; D B is equal to A C ; and B C common to both ; the two sides D B , B C , are equal to the two A C , C B , each to each , and the angle D B C is equal to the angle A C B : therefore , the base D C is equal to the base A B , and the triangle D B C ( Mr. Southey ) is equal to the triangle A C B , the less to the greater , which is absurd ” etc .

The ‘ Courier ’ of July 16 , 1811 , reports in full the first stage of the case Sir F. Burdett ‘ v . ’ William Scott ( ‘ vide supra ’ ) , which was brought before Lord Meadowbank as ordinary in the outer court . Jeffrey was counsel for the pursuer , who sought to recover a sum of £ 5000 lent under a bond . For the defence it was alleged that the money had been entrusted for a particular purpose , namely , the maintenance of an infant . Jeffrey denied the existence of any such claim , and maintained that whatever was scandalous or calumnious in the defence was absolutely untrue . The case , which was not included in the Scottish Law Reports , was probably settled out of court . Evidently the judge held that on technical grounds an action did not lie . Burdett 's enemies were not slow in turning the scandal to account . ( See a contemporary pamphlet , ‘ Adultery and Patriotism ’ , London , 1811 . )] ] [ Sub-Footnote A : This Latin has sorely puzzled the University of Edinburgh . Ballantyne said it meant the “ Bridge of Berwick , ” but Southey claimed it as half English ; Scott swore it was the “ Brig o ’ Stirling : ” he had just passed two King James 's and a dozen Douglasses over it . At last it was decided by Jeffrey , that it meant nothing more nor less than the “ counter of Archy Constable 's shop . ” ] [ Footnote 62 : Voltaire 's ‘ Pucelle ’ is not quite so immaculate as Mr. Southey 's ‘ Joan of Arc ’ , and yet I am afraid the Frenchman has both more truth and poetry too on his side — ( they rarely go together ) — than our patriotic minstrel , whose first essay was in praise of a fanatical French strumpet , whose title of witch would be correct with the change of the first letter . ] [ Footnote 63 : Like Sir Bland Burges 's ‘ Richard ’ ; the tenth book of which I read at Malta , on a trunk of Eyre 's , 19 , Cockspur-street . If this be doubted , I shall buy a portmanteau to quote from . [ Sir James Bland Burges ( 1752-1824 ) , who assumed , in 1821 , the name of Lamb , married , as his first wife , the Hon . Elizabeth Noel , daughter of Lord Wentworth , and younger sister of Byron 's mother-in-law , Lady Milbanke . He was called to the bar in 1777 , and in the same year was appointed a Commissioner in Bankruptcy . In 1787 he was returned M. P . for the borough of Helleston ; and from 1789 to 1795 held office as Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs . In 1795 , at the instance of his chief , Lord Grenville , he vacated his post , and by way of compensation was created a baronet with a sinecure post as Knight-Marshal of the Royal Household . Thenceforth he devoted himself to literature . In 1796 he wrote the ‘ Birth and Triumph of Love ’ , by way of letter-press to some elegant designs of the Princess Elizabeth . ( For ‘ Richard the First ’ and the ‘ Exodiad ’ , see note , p . 436 . ) His plays , ‘ Riches and Tricks for Travellers ’ , appeared in 1810 , and there were other works .

The “ Delia Cruscans ” were people of some education , and no profession ; but these Arcadians ( “ Arcades ambo ” — bumpkins both ) send out their native nonsense without the smallest alloy , and leave all the shoes and small-clothes in the parish unrepaired , to patch up Elegies on Enclosures , and Pæans to Gunpowder . Sitting on a shop-board , they describe the fields of battle , when the only blood they ever saw was shed from the finger ; and an “ Essay on War ” is produced by the ninth part of a “ poet ; ” “ And own that ‘ nine ’ such poets made a Tate . ” Did Nathan ever read that line of Pope ? and if he did , why not take it as his motto ? [ ‘ An Essay on War ; Honington Green , a Ballad ... an Elegy and other Poems , ’ was published in 1803 . ]] [ Footnote 70 : This well-meaning gentleman has spoiled some excellent shoemakers , and been accessory to the poetical undoing of many of the industrious poor . Nathaniel Bloomfield and his brother Bobby have set all Somersetshire singing ; nor has the malady confined itself to one county . Pratt too ( who once was wiser ) has caught the contagion of patronage , and decoyed a poor fellow named Blackett into poetry ; but he died during the operation , leaving one child and two volumes of “ Remains ” utterly destitute . The girl , if she do n't take a poetical twist , and come forth as a shoemaking Sappho , may do well ; but the “ tragedies ” are as ricketty as if they had been the offspring of an Earl or a Seatonian prize poet . The patrons of this poor lad are certainly answerable for his end ; and it ought to be an indictable offence . But this is the least they have done : for , by a refinement of barbarity , they have made the ( late ) man posthumously ridiculous , by printing what he would have had sense enough never to print himself . Certes these rakers of “ Remains ” come under the statute against “ resurrection men . ” What does it signify whether a poor dear dead dunce is to be stuck up in Surgeons ’ or in Stationers ’ Hall ? Is it so bad to unearth his bones as his blunders ? Is it not better to gibbet his body on a heath , than his soul in an octavo ? “ We know what we are , but we know not what we may be ; ” and it is to be hoped we never shall know , if a man who has passed through life with a sort of éclat is to find himself a mountebank on the other side of Styx , and made , like poor Joe Blackett , the laughing-stock of purgatory . The plea of publication is to provide for the child ; now , might not some of this ‘ Sutor ultra Crepidaitis ’ friends and seducers have done a decent action without inveigling Pratt into biography ? And then his inscription split into so many modicums !— “ To the Duchess of Somuch , the Right Hon . So-and-So , and Mrs. and Miss Somebody , these volumes are , ” etc . etc .— why , this is doling out the “ soft milk of dedication ” in gills ,— there is but a quart , and he divides it among a dozen . Why , Pratt , hadst thou not a puff left ? Dost thou think six families of distinction can share this in quiet ? There is a child , a book , and a dedication : send the girl to her grace , the volumes to the grocer , and the dedication to the devil .

That these gentlemen are in some cases kinder ,— the one to countrymen , and the other from his odd propensity to prefer evil to good ,— than the ‘ gods , men , and columns ’ of Horace , may be seen by a reference to the review of Campbell 's ‘ Gertrude of Wyoming ’ ; and in No . 31 of the ‘ Edinburgh Review ’ ( given to me the other day by the captain of an English frigate off Salamis ) , there is a similar concession to the mediocrity of Jamie Graham 's ‘ British Georgics ’ . It is fortunate for Campbell , that his fame neither depends on his last poem , nor the puff of the ‘ Edinburgh Review ’ . The catalogues of our English are also less fastidious than the pillars of the Roman librarians . A word more with the author of ‘ Gertrude of Wyoming ’ . At the end of a poem , and even of a couplet , we have generally ‘ that unmeaning thing we call a thought ; ’ so Mr. Campbell concludes with a thought in such a manner as to fulfil the whole of Pope 's prescription , and be as ‘ unmeaning ’ as the best of his brethren :— ‘ Because I may not ‘ stain ’ with grief The death-song of an Indian chief . ’ “ When I was in the fifth form , I carried to my master the translation of a chorus in Prometheus , wherein was a pestilent expression about ‘ staining a voice , ’ which met with no quarter . Little did I think that Mr. Campbell would have adopted my fifth form ‘ sublime ’ — at least in so conspicuous a situation . ‘ Sorrow ’ has been ‘ dry ’ ( in proverbs ) , and ‘ wet ’ ( in sonnets ) , this many a day ; and now it ‘'stains ’ ,' and stains a sound , of all feasible things ! To be sure , death-songs might have been stained with that same grief to very good purpose , if Outalissi had clapped down his stanzas on wholesome paper for the ‘ Edinburgh Evening Post ’ , or any other given hyperborean gazette ; or if the said Outalissi had been troubled with the slightest second sight of his own notes embodied on the last proof of an overcharged quarto ; but as he is supposed to have been an improvisatore on this occasion , and probably to the last tune he ever chanted in this world , it would have done him no discredit to have made his exit with a mouthful of common sense . Talking of ‘'staining ' ’ ( as Caleb Quotem says ) ‘ puts me in mind ’ of a certain couplet , which Mr. Campbell will find in a writer for whom he , and his school , have no small contempt :— ‘ E'en copious Dryden wanted , or forgot , The last and greatest art — the art to ‘ blot ’ !

In ‘ The Malediction of Minerva ( New Monthly Magazine ’ , vol . iii . p. 240 ) additional footnotes are appended ( 1 ) to line 106 , recording the obliteration of Lord Elgin 's name , “ which had been inscribed on a pillar of one of the principal temples , ” while that of Lady Elgin had been left untouched ; and ( 2 ) to line 196 , giving quotations from pp . 158 , 269 , 419 of Eustace 's ‘ Classical Tour in Italy ’ . After line 130 , which reads , “ And well I know within that murky land ” ( ‘ i. e ’ . Caledonia ) , the following apology for a hiatus was inserted : “ Here follows in the original certain lines which the editor has exercised his discretion by suppressing ; inasmuch as they comprise national reflections which the bard 's justifiable indignation has made him pour forth against a people which , if not universally of an amiable , is generally of a respectable character , and deserves not in this case to be censured ‘ en masse ’ for the faults of an individual . ” NOTE II . The text of ‘ The Curse of Minerva ’ is based on that of the quarto printed by T. Davison in 1813 . With the exception of the variants , as noted , the text corresponds with the MS. in the possession of Lord Stanhope . Doubtless it represents Byron 's final revision . The text of an edition of ‘ The Curse , etc ’ ., Philadelphia , 1815 , 8vo [ printed by De Silver and Co .] , was followed by Galignani ( third edit ., 1818 , etc . ) . The same text is followed , but not invariably , in the selections printed by Hone in 1816 ( 111 lines ) ; Wilson , 1818 ( 112 lines ) ; and Knight and Lacy , 1824 ( 111 lines ) .

And aye accursed , etc . ’ Wilson INTRODUCTION TO THE CURSE OF MINERVA ‘ The Curse of Minerva ’ , which was written at Athens , and is dated March 17 , 1811 , remained unpublished , as a whole , in this country , during Byron 's life-time . The arrangement which had been made with Cawthorn , to bring out a fifth edition of ‘ English Bards ’ , included the issue of a separate volume , containing ‘ Hints from Horace ’ and ‘ The Curse of Minerva ; ’ and , as Moore intimates , it was the withdrawal of the latter , in deference to the wishes of Lord Elgin or his connections , which led to the suppression of the other satires . The quarto edition of The ‘ Curse of Minerva ’ , printed by T. Davison in 1812 , was probably set up at the same time as Murray 's quarto edition of ‘ Childe Harold ’ , and reserved for private circulation . With or without Byron 's consent , the poem as a whole was published in Philadelphia by De Silver and Co ., 1815 , 8vo ( for variants , see p. 453 , ‘ note ’ ) . In a letter to Murray , March 6 , 1816 , he says that he “ disowns ” ‘ The Curse , etc . ’ , “ as stolen and published in a miserable and villainous copy in the magazine . ” The reference is to ‘ The Malediction of Minerva , or The Athenian Marble-Market ’ , which appeared in the ‘ New Monthly Magazine ’ for April , 1818 , vol . iii . 240 . It numbers 111 lines , and is signed “ Steropes ” ( The Lightner , a Cyclops ) . The text of the magazine , with the same additional footnotes , but under the title of ‘ The Curse ’ , etc ., was republished in the eighth edition of ‘ Poems on His Domestic Circumstances ’ , W. Hone , London , 1816 , 8vo , and , thenceforth , in other piratical issues . Whatever may have been his feelings or intentions in 1812 , four years later Byron was well aware that ‘ The Curse of Minerva ’ would not increase his reputation as a poet , while the object of his satire — the exposure and denunciation of Lord Elgin — had been accomplished by the scathing stanzas ( canto ii . 10-15 ) , with their accompanying note , in ‘ Childe Harold ’ . “ Disown ” it as he might , his words were past recall , and both indictments stand in his name . Byron was prejudiced against Elgin before he started on his tour . He had , perhaps , glanced at the splendid folio , ‘ Specimens of Ancient Sculpture ’ , which was issued by the Dilettanti Society in 1809 . Payne Knight wrote the preface , in which he maintains that the friezes and metopes of the Parthenon were not the actual work of Phidias , “ but ... architectural studies ... probably by workmen scarcely ranked among artists . ” So judged the leader of the ‘ cognoscenti ’ , and , in accordance with his views , Elgin and Aberdeen are held up to ridicule in ‘ English Bards ’ ( second edition , October , 1809 , 1 . 1007 , and ‘ note ’ ) as credulous and extravagant collectors of “ maimed antiques . ” It was , however , not till the first visit to Athens ( December , 1809-March , 1810 ) , when he saw with his own eyes the “ ravages of barbarous and antiquarian despoilers ” ( Lord Broughton 's ‘ Travels in Albania ’ , 1858 , i . 259 ) , that contempt gave way to indignation , and his wrath found vent in the pages of ‘ Childe Harold ’ . Byron cared as little for ancient buildings as he did for the authorities , or for patriotic enterprise , but he was stirred to the quick by the marks of fresh and , as he was led to believe , wanton injury to “ Athena 's poor remains . ” The southern side of the half-wrecked Parthenon had been deprived of its remaining metopes , which had suffered far less from the weather than the other sides which are still in the building ; all that remained of the frieze had been stripped from the three sides of the cella , and the eastern pediment had been despoiled of its diminished and mutilated , but still splendid , group of figures ; and , though five or six years had gone by , the blank spaces between the triglyphs must have revealed their recent exposure to the light , and the shattered edges of the cornice , which here and there had been raised and demolished to permit the dislodgment of the metopes , must have caught the eye as they sparkled in the sun . Nor had the removal and deportation of friezes and statues come to an end . The firman which Dr. Hunt , the chaplain to the embassy , had obtained in 1801 , which empowered Elgin and his agents to take away ‘ qualche pezzi di pietra ’ , still ran , and Don Tita Lusieri , the Italian artist , who remained in Elgin 's service , was still , like the ‘ canes venatici ’ ( Americané , “ smell-dogs ” ) employed by Verres in Sicily ( see ‘ Childe Harold ’ , canto ii . st. 12 , ‘ note ’ ) , finding fresh relics , and still bewailing to sympathetic travellers the hard fate which compelled him to despoil the temples ‘ malgré lui ’ . The feelings of the inhabitants themselves were not much in question , but their opinions were quoted for and against the removal of the marbles . Elgin 's secretary and prime agent , W. R. Hamilton , testifies , from personal knowledge , that , “ so far from exciting any unpleasant sensations , the people seemed to feel it as the means of bringing foreigners into the country , and of having money spent there ” ( ‘ Memoir on the Earl of Elgin 's Pursuits in Greece ’ , 1811 ) . On the other hand , the traveller , Edward Daniel Clarke , with whom Byron corresponded ( see ‘ Childe Harold ’ , canto ii . st. 12 , ‘ note ’ ) , speaks of the attachment of the Turks to the Parthenon , and their religious veneration for the building as a mosque , and tells a pathetic story of the grief of the Disdar when “ a metope was lowered , and the adjacent masonry scattered its white fragments with thundering noise among the ruins ” ( ‘ Travels in Various Countries ’ , part ii , sect . ii , p. 483 ) . Other travellers of less authority than Clarke — Dodwell , for instance , who visited the Parthenon before it had been dismantled , and , afterwards , was present at the removal of metopes ; and Hughes , who came after Byron ( autumn , 1813 ) — make use of such phrases as “ shattered desolation , ” “ wanton devastation and avidity of plunder . ” Even Michaelis , the great archaeologist , who denounces ‘ The Curse of Minerva ’ as a “ ‘ libellous ’ poem , ” and affirms “ that only blind passion could doubt that Lord Elgin 's act was an act of preservation , ” admits that “ the removal of several metopes and of the statue from the Erechtheion had severely injured the surrounding architecture ” ( ‘ Ancient Marbles in Great Britain ’ , by A. Michaelis , translated by C. A. M . Fennell , 1882 , p. 135 ) . Highly coloured and emotional as some of these phrases may be , they explain , if they do not justify , the ‘ sæva indignatio ’ of Byron 's satire . It is almost , if not quite , unnecessary to state the facts on the other side . History regards Lord Elgin as a disinterested official , who at personal loss ( at least thirty-five thousand pounds on his own showing ) , and in spite of opposition and disparagement , secured for his own country and the furtherance of art the perishable fragments of Phidian workmanship , which , but for his intervention , might have perished altogether . If they had eluded the clutches of Turkish mason and Greek dealer in antiquities — if , by some happy chance , they had escaped the ravages of war , the gradual but gradually increasing assaults of rain and frost would have already left their effacing scars on the “ Elgin marbles . ” As it is , the progress of decay has been arrested , and all the world is the gainer . Byron was neither a prophet nor an archaeologist , and time and knowledge have put him in the wrong . But in 1810 the gaps in the entablature of the Parthenon were new , the Phidian marbles were huddled in a “ damp dirty penthouse ” in Park Lane ( see ‘ Life of Haydon ’ , i . 84 ) , and the logic of events had not justified a sad necessity .

[ viii ] As thus , within the walls of Pallas ’ fane , I marked the beauties of the land and main , Alone , and friendless , on the magic shore , Whose arts and arms but live in poets ’ lore ; Oft as the matchless dome I turned to scan , Sacred to Gods , but not secure from Man , 60 The Past returned , the Present seemed to cease , And Glory knew no clime beyond her Greece !

Yes ,' twas Minerva 's self ; but , ah ! how changed , Since o'er the Dardan field in arms she ranged ! Not such as erst , by her divine command , Her form appeared from Phidias ’ plastic hand : Gone were the terrors of her awful brow , Her idle Ægis bore no Gorgon now ; 80 Her helm was dinted , and the broken lance Seemed weak and shaftless e'en to mortal glance ; The Olive Branch , which still she deigned to clasp , Shrunk from her touch , and withered in her grasp ; And , ah ! though still the brightest of the sky , Celestial tears bedimmed her large blue eye ; Round the rent casque her owlet circled slow , And mourned his mistress with a shriek of woe ! “ Mortal ! ” — ‘ twas thus she spake — “ that blush of shame Proclaims thee Briton , once a noble name ; 90 First of the mighty , foremost of the free , [ x ] Now honoured ‘ less ’ by all , and ‘ least ’ by me : Chief of thy foes shall Pallas still be found .

So , once of yore , each reasonable frog , Swore faith and fealty to his sovereign ‘ log . ’ Thus hailed your rulers their patrician clod , As Egypt chose an onion<span type="note_anchor">[ 21 ]</span>for a God . “ Now fare ye well ! enjoy your little hour ; Go , grasp the shadow of your vanished power ; 260 Gloss o'er the failure of each fondest scheme ; Your strength a name , your bloated wealth a dream . Gone is that Gold , the marvel of mankind . And Pirates barter all that 's left behind .<span type="note_anchor">[ 22 ]</span>No more the hirelings , purchased near and far , Crowd to the ranks of mercenary war . The idle merchant on the useless quay Droops o'er the bales no bark may bear away ; Or , back returning , sees rejected stores Rot piecemeal on his own encumbered shores : 270 The starved mechanic breaks his rusting loom , And desperate mans him ‘ gainst the coming doom . Then in the Senates of your sinking state Show me the man whose counsels may have weight . Vain is each voice where tones could once command ; E'en factions cease to charm a factious land : Yet jarring sects convulse a sister Isle , And light with maddening hands the mutual pile . “ ‘ Tis done , ‘ tis past — since Pallas warns in vain ; The Furies seize her abdicated reign : 280 Wide o'er the realm they wave their kindling brands , And wring her vitals with their fiery hands . But one convulsive struggle still remains , [ xix ] And Gaul shall weep ere Albion wear her chains , The bannered pomp of war , the glittering files , [ xx ] O'er whose gay trappings stern Bellona smiles ; The brazen trump , the spirit-stirring drum , That bid the foe defiance ere they come ; The hero bounding at his country 's call , The glorious death that consecrates his fall , 290 Swell the young heart with visionary charms . And bid it antedate the joys of arms . But know , a lesson you may yet be taught , With death alone are laurels cheaply bought ; Not in the conflict Havoc seeks delight , His day of mercy is the day of fight . But when the field is fought , the battle won , Though drenched with gore , his woes are but begun : His deeper deeds as yet ye know by name ; The slaughtered peasant and the ravished dame , 300 The rifled mansion and the foe-reaped field , Ill suit with souls at home , untaught to yield . Say with what eye along the distant down Would flying burghers mark the blazing town ? How view the column of ascending flames Shake his red shadow o'er the startled Thames ? Nay , frown not , Albion ! for the torch was thine That lit such pyres from Tagus to the Rhine : Now should they burst on thy devoted coast , Go , ask thy bosom who deserves them most ? 310 The law of Heaven and Earth is life for life , And she who raised , in vain regrets , the strife . ” [ Footnote 1 : The lines ( 1-54 ) with which the Satire begins , down to “ As thus , within the walls of Pallas ’ fane , ” first appeared ( 1814 ) as the opening stanza of the Third Canto of ‘ The Corsair ’ . At that time the publication of ‘ The Curse of Minerva ’ had been abandoned .

The citadel was given up to the English , and the Danes surrendered their fleet , with all the naval stores , and their arsenals and dockyards . The expedition was “ promptly and secretly equipped ” by the British Government “ with an activity and celerity , ” says Koch ( ‘ Hist . of Europe ’ , p. 214 ) , “ such as they had never displayed in sending aid to their allies , ” with a view to anticipate the seizure and appropriation of the Danish fleet by Napoleon and Alexander ( Green 's ‘ Hist . English People ’ ( 1875 ) , p. 799 ) . ]] [ Footnote 18 : “ The East ” is brought within range of Minerva 's curse , ‘ symmetriae causâ ’ , and it is hard to say to which “ rebellion ” she refers . A choice lies between the mutiny which broke out in 1809 , during Sir George Barlow 's presidency of Madras , among the officers of the Company 's service , and which at one time threatened the continuance of British sway in India ; and later troubles , in 1810 , arising from the Pindárí hordes , who laid waste the villages of Central India and Hindostan , and from the Pathans , who invaded Berar under Ameer Khan . But here , as in lines 245-258 ( ‘ vide infra ’ , p. 470 , ‘ note ’ i ) , Byron is taking toll of a note to ‘ Epics of the Ton ’ , pp . 246 , 247 , which enlarges on the mutiny of native soldiers which took place at Vellore in 1806 , where several “ European officers and a considerable portion of the 69th Regiment were massacred , ” in consequence of “ an injudicious order with respect to the dress of the Sepoys . ” — Gleig 's ‘ History of the British Empire in India ’ ( 1835 ) , iii . 233 , ‘ note ’ . ]] [ Footnote 19 : The victory of “ bright Barossa , ” March 5 , 1811 , was achieved by the sudden determination — “ an inspiration rather than a resolution , ” says Napier — of the British commander , General Graham ( Thomas , Lord Lynedoch , 1750-1843 ) , to counter-march his troops , and force the eminence known as the Cerro de Puerco , or hill of Barosa , which had fallen into the hands of the French under Ruffin . Graham was at this time second in command to the Spanish Captain-general , La Peña , and at his orders , but under the impression that the hill would be guarded by the Spanish troops , was making his way to a neighbouring height . Meantime La Peña had withdrawn the corps of battle to a distance , and left the hill covered with baggage and imperfectly protected . Graham recaptured Barosa , and repulsed the French with heavy loss , in an hour and a half . Napier affirms that La Peña “ looked idly on , neither sending his cavalry nor his horse artillery to the assistance of his ally ; ” and testifies “ that no stroke in aid of the British was struck by a Spanish sabre that day . ” “ Famine ” may have raised the devil in the English troops , but it prevented them from following up the victory . A further charge against the Spaniards was that , after Barosa had been won , the English were left for hours without food , and , as they had marched through the night before they came into action , they could only look on while the French made good their retreat . Two companies of the 20th Portuguese formed part of the British contingent , and took part in the engagement . The year before , at Busaco ( September 27 , 1810 ) , the Portuguese had displayed signal bravery ; but at Gebora ( February 19 , 1811 ) “ Madden 's Portuguese , regardless of his example and reproaches , shamefully turned their backs ” ( Napier 's ‘ History of the Peninsular War ’ ( 1890 ) , iii . 26 , 98 , 102-107 ) . ] [ Footnote 20 : “ Blest paper credit ! last and best supply , That lends Corruption lighter wings to fly . ” ( POPE . ) [ In February , 1811 , a select committee of the House of Commons “ on commercial credit ” recommended an advance of £ 6 , 000 , 000 to manufacturers who were suffering from over-speculation . “ Did they not know , ” asked Lord Grenville , in the House of Lords , March 21 , “ that they were adding to the mass of paper at this moment in existence a sum of £ 6 , 000 , 000 , as if there was not paper enough already in the country , in order to protect their commerce and manufactures from destruction ? ” Nevertheless , the measure passed . The year before ( February 19 , 1810 ) , a committee which had sat under the presidency of Francis Horner , to inquire into the cause of the high price of gold bullion ( gold was worth £ 4 . 10s . an ounce ) , returned ( June 10 ) a report urging the resumption of cash payment at the end of two years . It has been suggested to the editor that the asterisks ( ’ —— ’ ) in line 251 ( which are not filled up in Lord Stanhope 's MS. of ‘ The Curse of Minerva ’ ) stand for “ Horner , ” and that Byron , writing at Athens in March , 1811 , was under the impression that Perceval would adopt sound views on the currency question , and was not aware that he was strongly anti-bullionist . On that supposition the two premiers are Portland and Perceval , Horner is the Mentor , and Perceval ( line 257 ) the “ patrician clod . ” To what extent Byron was ‘ au courant ’ with home politics when he wrote the lines , it is impossible to say , and without such knowledge some doubt must rest on any interpretation of the passage . But of its genesis there is no doubt . Lady Ann Hamilton , in her estimate of Lord Henry Petty , in ‘ Epics of the Ton ’ ( p. 139 ) , has something to say on budget “ figures ” — “ Those imps which make the senses reel , and zounds ! Mistake a cypher for a thousand pounds ; ” and her note-writer comments thus : “ It somewhat hurts the feelings to see a minister stand up in his place , and after a very pretty exordium to the budget , take up a bundle of papers from the table , gaze at the incomprehensible calculations before him , stammer out a few confused numbers , and then , with a rueful face , look over his shoulder to V — ns — rt for assistance . How often have I grieved to see unhappy A — d — g — n in this lamentable predicament ! ” Again , on Thellusson being raised to the peerage as Lord Rendlesham , she asks — “ Say , shall we bend to titles thus bestowed , And like the Egyptians , hail the calf a god ? With toads , asps , onions , ornament the shrine , And reptiles own and pot-herbs things divine ? ” It is evident that Byron , uninspired by Pallas , turned to the ‘ Epics of the Ton ’ for “ copy , ” but whether he left a blank on purpose because “ Vansittart ” ( to whom Perceval did turn ) would not scan , or , misled by old newspapers , would have written “ Horner , ” must remain a mystery . ]] [ Footnote 21 : See the portrait of Spencer Perceval in the National Portrait Gallery . ] [ Footnote 22 : The Deal and Dover traffickers in specie . ] [ Footnote i : ‘ O'er the blue ocean way his ’ .

[ ‘ MS ’ . ]] INTRODUCTION TO ‘ THE WALTZ ’ Byron spent the autumn of 1812 “ by the waters of Cheltenham , ” and , besides writing to order his ‘ Song of Drury Lane ’ ( the address spoken at the opening of the theatre , Oct. 10 , 1812 ) , he put in hand a ‘ Satire on Waltzing ’ . It was published anonymously in the following spring ; but , possibly , because it was somewhat coolly received , he told Murray ( April 21 , 1813 ) “ to contradict the report that he was the author of a certain malicious publication on waltzing . ” In his memoranda “ chiefly with reference to my Byron , ” Moore notes “ Byron 's hatred of waltzing , ” and records a passage of arms between “ the lame boy ” and Mary Chaworth , which arose from her “ dancing with some person who was unknown to her . ” Then , and always , he must have experienced the bitter sense of exclusion from active amusements ; but it is a hasty assumption that Byron only denounced waltzing because he was unable to waltz himself . To modern sentiment , on the moral side , waltzing is unassailable ; but the first impressions of spectators , to whom it was a novelty , were distinctly unfavourable . In a letter from Germany ( May 17 , 1799 ) Coleridge describes a dance round the maypole at Rübeland . “ The dances were reels and the waltzes , but chiefly the latter ; this dance is in the higher circles sufficiently voluptuous , but here the motions of it were ‘ far ’ more faithful interpreters of the passions . ” A year later , H. C. Robinson , writing from Frankfort in 1800 ( ‘ Diary and Letters ’ , i . 76 ) , says , “ The dancing is unlike anything you ever saw . You must have heard of it under the name of waltzing , that is rolling and turning , though the rolling is not horizontal but perpendicular . Yet Werther , after describing his first waltz with Charlotte , says , and I say so too , ‘ I felt that if I were married my wife should waltz ( or roll ) with no one but myself . ’ ” Ten years later , Gillray publishes a caricature of the waltz , as a French dance , which he styles , “ Le bon Genre . ” It is not a pretty picture . By degrees , however , and with some reluctance , society yielded to the fascinations of the stranger . “ My cousin Hartington , ” writes Lady Caroline Lamb , in 1812 ( ‘ Memoirs of Viscount Melbourne ’ , by W. T . McCullagh Torrens , i . 105 ) , “ wanted to have waltzes and quadrilles ; and at Devonshire House it could not be allowed , so we had them in the great drawing-room at Whitehall . All the ‘ bon ton ’ assembled there continually . There was nothing so fashionable . ” “ No event , ” says Thomas Raikes ( ‘ Personal Reminiscences ’ , p. 284 ) , ever produced so great a sensation in English society as the introduction of the German waltz .... Old and young returned to school , and the mornings were now absorbed at home in practising the figures of a French quadrille or whirling a chair round the room to learn the step and measure of the German waltz . The anti-waltzing party took the alarm , cried it down ; mothers forbad it , and every ballroom became a scene of feud and contention . The foreigners were not idle in forming their ‘ élèves ’ ; Baron Tripp , Neumann , St. Aldegonde , etc ., persevered in spite of all prejudices which were marshalled against them . It was not , however , till Byron 's “ malicious publication ” had been issued and forgotten that the new dance received full recognition . “ When , ” Raikes concludes , “ the Emperor Alexander was seen waltzing round the room at Almack 's with his tight uniform and numerous decorations , ” or [ Gronow , ‘ Recollections ’ , 1860 , pp . 32 , 33 ] “ Lord Palmerston might have been seen describing an infinite number of circles with Madame de Lieven , ” insular prejudices gave way , and waltzing became general .

    <p>TO THE PUBLISHER . SIR , I am a country Gentleman of a midland county . I might have been a Parliament-man for a certain borough ; having had the offer of as many votes as General T. at the general election in 1812 .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>But I was all for domestic happiness ; as , fifteen years ago , on a visit to London , I married a middle-aged Maid of Honour . We lived happily at Hornem Hall till last Season , when my wife and I were invited by the Countess of Waltzaway ( a distant relation of my Spouse ) to pass the winter in town . Thinking no harm , and our Girls being come to a marriageable ( or , as they call it , ‘ marketable ’ ) age , and having besides a Chancery suit inveterately entailed upon the family estate , we came up in our old chariot ,— of which , by the bye , my wife grew so ashamed in less than a week , that I was obliged to buy a second-hand barouche , of which I might mount the box , Mrs. H. says , if I could drive , but never see the inside — that place being reserved for the Honourable Augustus Tiptoe , her partner-general and Opera-knight . Hearing great praises of Mrs. H .' s dancing ( she was famous for birthnight minuets in the latter end of the last century ) , I unbooted , and went to a ball at the Countess 's , expecting to see a country dance , or , at most , Cotillons , reels , and all the old paces to the newest tunes , But , judge of my surprise , on arriving , to see poor dear Mrs. Hornem with her arms half round the loins of a huge hussar-looking gentleman I never set eyes on before ; and his , to say truth , rather more than half round her waist , turning round , and round , to a d —— d see-saw up-and-down sort of tune , that reminded me of the “ Black Joke , ” only more “ ‘ affettuoso '"[ 1 ] till it made me quite giddy with wondering they were not so . By and by they stopped a bit , and I thought they would sit or fall down :— but no ; with Mrs. H .' s hand on his shoulder , “ ‘ Quam familiariter '"[ 2 ] ( as Terence said , when I was at school ,) they walked about a minute , and then at it again , like two cock-chafers spitted on the same bodkin . I asked what all this meant , when , with a loud laugh , a child no older than our Wilhelmina ( a name I never heard but in the ‘ Vicar of Wakefield ’ , though her mother would call her after the Princess of Swappenbach ,) said , “ L — d ! Mr. Hornem , can n't you see they 're valtzing ? ” or waltzing ( I forget which ) ; and then up she got , and her mother and sister , and away they went , and round-abouted it till supper-time . Now that I know what it is , I like it of all things , and so does Mrs. H. ( though I have broken my shins , and four times overturned Mrs. Hornem 's maid , in practising the preliminary steps in a morning ) . Indeed , so much do I like it , that having a turn for rhyme , tastily displayed in some election ballads , and songs in honour of all the victories ( but till lately I have had little practice in that way ) , I sat down , and with the aid of William Fitzgerald , Esq ., and a few hints from Dr. Busby , ( whose recitations I attend , and am monstrous fond of Master Busby 's manner of delivering his father 's late successful “ Drury Lane Address , ” )[ 1 ] I composed the following hymn , wherewithal to make my sentiments known to the Public ; whom , nevertheless , I heartily despise , as well as the critics .

If the “ great Lord 's ” ‘ Cincinnatian ’ progress in agriculture be no speedier than the proportional average of time in Pope 's couplet , it will , according to the farmer 's proverb , be “ ploughing with dogs . ” By the bye — one of this illustrious person 's new titles is forgotten — it is , however , worth remembering — “ ‘ Salvador del mundo ! ” credite , posteri ’ ! If this be the appellation annexed by the inhabitants of the Peninsula to the name of a ‘ man ’ who has not yet saved them — query — are they worth saving , even in this world ? for , according to the mildest modifications of any Christian creed , those three words make the odds much against them in the next — “ Saviour of the world , ” quotha !— it were to be wished that he , or any one else , could save a corner of it — his country . Yet this stupid misnomer , although it shows the near connection between superstition and impiety , so far has its use , that it proves there can be little to dread from those Catholics ( inquisitorial Catholics too ) who can confer such an appellation on a ‘ Protestant ’ . I suppose next year he will be entitled the “ Virgin Mary ; ” if so , Lord George Gordon himself would have nothing to object to such liberal bastards of our Lady of Babylon . [ William Pole-Wellesley ( 1785 ? - 1857 ) , afterwards fourth Lord Mornington , a nephew of the great Duke of Wellington , married , in March , 1812 , Catharine , daughter and heiress of Sir Tylney Long , Bart . On his marriage he added his wife 's double surname to his own , and , thereby , gave the wits their chance . In ‘ Rejected Addresses ’ Fitzgerald is made to exclaim — “ Bless every man possess 'd of aught to give , Long may Long-Tilney-Wellesley-Long-Pole live . ” The principals in the duel to which Byron alludes were Wellesley-Pole and Lord Kilworth . The occasion of the quarrel was a misconception of some expression of Pole 's at an assembly at Lady Hawarden 's ( August 6 , 1811 ) . A meeting took place on Wimbledon Common ( August 9 ) , at which the seconds intervened , and everything was “ amicably adjusted . ” Some days later a letter appeared in the ‘ Morning Post ’ ( August 14 , 1811 ) , signed “ Kilworth , ” to the effect that an apology had been offered and accepted . This led to a second meeting on Hounslow Heath ( August 15 ) , when shots were exchanged . Again the seconds intervened , and , after more explanations , matters were finally arranged . A ‘ jeu d'esprit ’ which appeared in the ‘ Morning Chronicle ’ ( August 16 , 1811 ) connects the “ mortal fracas ” with Pole 's prowess in waltzing at a fête at Wanstead House , near Hackney , where , when the heiress had been wooed and won , his guests used to dine at midnight after the opera . “ Mid the tumult of waltzing and wild Irish reels , A prime dancer , I 'm sure to get at her — And by Love 's graceful movements to trip up her heels , Is the Long and the short of the matter . ” ] [ Footnote 4 : Thomas Busby , Mus .

Amongst other details omitted in the various [ A ] despatches of our eloquent ambassador , he did not state ( being too much occupied with the exploits of Colonel C ——, in swimming rivers frozen , and galloping over roads impassable ,) that one entire province perished by famine in the most melancholy manner , as follows :— In General Rostopchin 's consummate conflagration , the consumption of tallow and train oil was so great , that the market was inadequate to the demand : and thus one hundred and thirty-three thousand persons were starved to death , by being reduced to wholesome diet ! the lamp-lighters of London have since subscribed a pint ( of oil ) a piece , and the tallow-chandlers have unanimously voted a quantity of best moulds ( four to the pound ) , to the relief of the surviving Scythians ;— the scarcity will soon , by such exertions , and a proper attention to the ‘ quality ’ rather than the quantity of provision , be totally alleviated . It is said , in return , that the untouched Ukraine has subscribed sixty thousand beeves for a day 's meal to our suffering manufacturers . [ Hamburg fell to Napoleon 's forces in 1810 , and thence-forward the mails from the north of Europe were despatched from Anholt , or Gothenberg , or Heligoland . In 1811 an attempt to enforce the conscription resulted in the emigration of numbers of young men of suitable age for military service . The unfortunate city was deprived of mails and males at the same time . Heligoland , which was taken by the British in 1807 , and turned into a depot for the importation of smuggled goods to French territory , afforded a meeting-place for British and continental traders . Mails from Heligoland detailed rumours of what was taking place at the centres of war ; but the newspapers occasionally threw doubts on the information obtained from this source . Lord Cathcart 's despatch , dated November 23 , appeared in the ‘ Gazette ’ December 16 , 1812 . The paragraph which appealed to Byron 's sense of humour is as follows : “ The expedition of Colonel Chernichef ( ‘ sic ’ ) [ the Czar 's aide-de-camp ] was a continued and extraordinary exertion , he having marched seven hundred wersts ( ‘ sic ’ ) in five days , and swam several rivers . ” ] [ Sub-Footnote A : Veracious despatches .— [ ‘ MS.

Amongst such Kotzebue holds a high rank .

In the olden time philosophers had whiskers , and soldiers none — Scipio himself was shaven — Hannibal thought his one eye handsome enough without a beard ; but Adrian , the emperor , wore a beard ( having warts on his chin , which neither the Empress Sabina nor even the courtiers could abide ) — Turenne had whiskers , Marlborough none — Buonaparte is unwhiskered , the Regent whiskered ; “ ‘ argal ’ ” greatness of mind and whiskers may or may not go together ; but certainly the different occurrences , since the growth of the last mentioned , go further in behalf of whiskers than the anathema of Anselm did ‘ against ’ long hair in the reign of Henry I .— Formerly , ‘ red ’ was a favourite colour .

Jacobi , who affirms that “ Werther ( ‘ Sorrows of Werther ’ , Letter ix . ) , the lover of Charlotte , swears that , were he to perish for it , never should a girl for whom he entertained any affection , and on whom he had honourable views , dance the waltz with any other man besides himself . ” — ‘ Selections from the Works of Madame de Genlis ’ ( 1806 ) , p. 65 .

Oh , Jack , there never can be but one man in the world whom a truly modest and delicate woman ought to pair with in a country-dance ; and even then , the rest of the couples should be her great-uncles and aunts ! ” ] [ Footnote 17 : An anachronism — Waltz and the battle of Austerlitz are before said to have opened the ball together ; the bard means ( if he means anything ) , Waltz was not so much in vogue till the Regent attained the acme of his popularity . Waltz , the comet , whiskers , and the new government , illuminated heaven and earth , in all their glory , much about the same time : of these the comet only has disappeared ; the other three continue to astonish us still .— ‘ Printers Devil ’ . [ As the ‘ Printer 's Devil ’ intimates , the various novelties of the age of “ Waltz ” are somewhat loosely enumerated . The Comet , which signalized 1811 , the year of the restricted Regency , had disappeared before the Prince and his satellites burst into full blaze in 1812 . It was ( see ‘ Historical Record of the Life Guards ’ , 1835 , p. 177 ) in 1812 that the Prince Regent commanded the following alterations to be made in the equipments of the regiment of Life Guards : “ Cocked hats with feathers to be discontinued , and brass helmets with black horsehair crests substituted . Long coats , trimmed with gold lace across the front . Shirts and cuffs to be replaced by short coatees , ” etc ., etc . In the same branch of the service , whiskers were already in vogue . The “ new laws ” were those embodied in the “ Frame-work Bill , ” which Byron denounced in his speech in the House of Lords , Feb. 27 , 1812 . Formerly the breaking of frames had been treated “ as a minor felony , punishable by transportation for fourteen years , ” and the object of the bill was to make such offences capital . The bill passed into law on March 5 , and as a result we read ( ‘ Annual Register ’ , 1812 , pp . 38 , 39 ) that on May 24 a special commission for the rioters of Cheshire was opened by Judge Dallas at Chester . “ His lordship passed the awful sentence of death upon sixteen , and in a most impressioned address , held out not the smallest hope of mercy . ” Of these five ‘ only ’ were hanged . Owing to the scarcity of silver coinage , the Bank of England was empowered to issue bank-tokens for various sums ( Mr. Hornem bought his motto for ‘ The Waltz ’ with a three-shilling bank-token ; see ‘ note ’ to Preface ) which came into circulation on July 9 , 1811 . The “ new ninepences ” which were said to be forthcoming never passed into circulation at all . A single “ pattern ” coin ( on the obverse , ‘ Bank Token , Ninepence , 1812 ’ ) is preserved in the British Museum ( see privately printed ‘ Catalogue ’ , by W. Boyne ( 1866 ) , p. 11 ) . The “ new victories ” were the fall of Ciudad Rodrigo ( Jan. 17 ) , the capture of Badajoz ( April 7 ) , and the Battle of Salamanca ( July 12 , 1812 ) . By way of “ new wars , ” the President of the United States declared war with Great Britain on June 18 , and Great Britain with the United States , Oct. 13 , 1812 .

Both as Secretary at War and as Prime Minister his chief efforts were devoted to the support of Wellington in the Peninsula . ] [ Footnote 20 : “ Oh that ‘ right ’ should thus overcome ‘ might ! ’ ” Who does not remember the “ delicate investigation ” in the ‘ Merry Wives of Windsor ’ ?— ‘ Ford ’ . Pray you , come near ; if I suspect without cause , why then make sport at me ; then let me be your jest ; I deserve it . How now ? whither bear you this ? ‘ Mrs. Ford ’ .

Accordingly the Prince Regent desired the Marquis Wellesley and Canning to approach Lords Grey and Grenville with regard to the formation of a coalition ministry . They were unsuccessful , and as a next step Lord Moira ( Francis Rawdon , first Marquis of Hastings , 1754-1826 ) was empowered to make overtures in the same quarter . The Whig Lords stipulated that the regulation of the Household should rest with ministers , and to this Moira would not consent , possibly because the Prince 's favourite , Lord Yarmouth , was Vice-Chamberlain . Negotiations were again broken off , and on June 9 Liverpool began his long term of office as Prime Minister . “ I sate , ” writes Byron , “ in the debate or rather discussion in the House of Lords on that question ( the second negotiation ) immediately behind Moira , who , while Grey was speaking , turned round to me repeatedly , and asked me whether I agreed with him . It was an awkward question to me , who had not heard both sides . Moira kept repeating to me , ‘ It is ‘ not ’ so ; it is so and so , ’ ” etc . ( Letter to W. Bankes ( undated ) , ‘ Life ’ , p. 162 ) . Hence the question , “ My Moira , what say you ? ” ] [ Footnote 22 : “ We have changed all that , ” says the Mock Doctor — ‘ tis all gone — Asmodeus knows where . After all , it is of no great importance how women 's hearts are disposed of ; they have nature 's privilege to distribute them as absurdly as possible . But there are also some men with hearts so thoroughly bad , as to remind us of those phenomena often mentioned in natural history ; viz . a mass of solid stone — only to be opened by force — and when divided , you discover a toad in the centre , lively , and with the reputation of being venomous . ” [ In the MS. the last sentence stood : “ In this country there is one man with a heart so thoroughly bad that it reminds us of those unaccountable petrifactions often mentioned in natural history , ” etc .

As a Whig , he held office in the Household during North 's Coalition Ministry , but throughout George the Third 's first illness in 1788 , displayed such indecent partisanship with the Prince of Wales , that , when the king recovered , he lost his post . His dukedom died with him , and his immense fortune was divided between the heirs to his other titles and his friends .
