   <head>REV . GEORGE GILFILLAN .</head>
   <head>THE LIFE OF AKENSIDE .</head>
   <p>Mark Akenside was born at Newcastle-upon-Tyne on the 9th of November 1721 . His family were Presbyterian Dissenters , and on the 30th of that month he was baptized in the meeting , then held in Hanover Square , by a Mr. Benjamin Bennet . His father , Mark , was a butcher in respectable circumstances — his mother 's name was Mary Lumsden . There may seem something grotesque in finding the author of the “ Pleasures of Imagination ” born in a place usually thought so anti-poetical as a butcher 's shop . And yet similar anomalies abound in the histories of men of genius . Henry Kirke White , too , was a butcher 's son , and for some time carried his father 's basket . The late Thomas Atkinson , a very clever littérateur of the West of Scotland , was also what the Scotch call a “ flesher 's ” son . The case of Cardinal Wolsey is well known . Indeed , we do not understand why any decent calling should be inimical to the existence — however it may be to the adequate development — of genius . That is a spark of supernal inspiration , lighting where it pleases , often conforming , and always striving to conform , circumstances to itself , and sometimes even strengthened and purified by the contradictions it meets in life . Nay , genius has sprung up in stranger quarters than in butcher 's shops or tailor 's attics — it has lived and nourished in the dens of robbers , and in the gross and fetid atmosphere of taverns . There was an Allen-a-Dale in Robin Hood 's gang ; it was in the Bell Inn , at Gloucester , that George Whitefield , the most gifted of popular orators , was reared ; and Bunyan 's Muse found him at the disrespectable trade of a tinker , and amidst the clatter of pots , and pans , and vulgar curses , made her whisper audible in his ear , “ Come up hither to the Mount of Vision — to the summit of Mount Clear ! ”</p>
   <p>It is said that Akenside was ashamed of his origin — and if so , he deserved the perpetual recollection of it , produced by a life-long lameness , originating in a cut from his father 's cleaver . It is fitting that men , and especially great men , should suffer through their smallnesses of character . The boy was first sent to the Free School of Newcastle , and thence to a private academy kept by Mr. Wilson , a Dissenting minister of the place . He began rather early to display a taste for poetry and verse-writing ; and , in April 1737 , we find in the Gentleman 's Magazine a set of stanzas , entitled , “ The Virtuoso , in imitation of Spenser 's style and stanza , ” prefaced by a letter signed Marcus , in which the author , while requesting the insertion of his piece , pleads the apology of his extreme youth . One may see something of the future political zeal of the man in the boy 's selection of one of the names of Brutus . The Gentleman 's Magazine was then rising toward that character of a readable medley and agreeable olla podrida , which it long bore , although its principal contributor — Johnson — did not join its staff till the next year . Its old numbers will even still repay perusal — at least we seldom enjoyed a greater treat than when in our boyhood we lighted on and read some twenty of its brown-hued , stout-backed , strong-bound volumes , filled with the debates in the Senate of Lilliput — with Johnson 's early Lives and Essays — with mediocre poetry — interesting scraps of meteorological and scientific information — ghost stories and fairy tales — alternating with timid politics , and with sarcasms at the great , veiled under initials , asterisks , and innuendoes ; and even now many , we believe , feel it quite a luxury to recur from the personalities and floridities of modern periodicals to its quiet , cool , sober , and sensible pages . To it Akenside contributed afterwards a fable , called “ Ambition and Content , ” a “ Hymn to Science , ” and a few more poetical pieces ( written not , as commonly said , in Edinburgh , but in Newcastle , in 1739 ) . It has been asserted that he composed his “ Pleasures of Imagination ” while visiting some relations at Morpeth , when only seventeen years of age ; but although he himself assures us that he spent many happy and inspired hours in that region ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Led</l>
     <l n="2">In silence by some powerful hand unseen , ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>there is no direct evidence that he then fixed his vague , tumultuous , youthful impressions in verse . Indeed , the texture and style of the “ Pleasures ” forbid the thought that it was a hasty improvisation . When nearly eighteen years old , Akenside was sent to Edinburgh , to commence his studies for the pulpit , and received some pecuniary assistance from the Dissenters ’ Society . One winter , however , served to disgust him with the prospects of the profession — which he resigned for the pursuit of medicine , repaying the contribution he had received from the society . We know a similar case in the present day of a well-known , able littérateur — once the editor of the Westminster Review — who had been educated at the expense of the Congregational body in Scotland , but who , after a change of religious view and of profession , honourably refunded the whole sum . What were the special reasons why Akenside turned aside from the Church we are not informed . Perhaps he had fallen into youthful indiscretions or early scepticism ; or perhaps he felt that the business of a Dissenting pastor was not then , any more than it is now , a very lucrative one . Presbyterian Dissent at that time , besides , did not stand very high in England . The leading Dissenting divines were Independents — and the Presbyterian body was fast sinking into Unitarian or Arian heresy . On the other hand , the Church of England was in the last state of lukewarmness ; the Church of Scotland was groaning under the load of patronage ; and the Secession body was newly formed , and as yet insignificant . In such circumstances we cannot wonder that an ardent , ambitious mind like that of Akenside should revolt from divinity as a study , and the pulpit as a goal , although some may think it strange how the pursuit of medicine should commend itself instead to a genial and poetic mind . Yet let us remember that some eminent poets have been students or practisers of the art of medicine . Such — to name only a few — were Armstrong , Smollett , Crabbe , Darwin , Delta , Keats , and the two Thomas Browns , the Knight of the “ Religio Medici , ” and the Philosopher of the “ Lectures , ” both genuine poets , although their best poetry is in prose . There are , besides , connected with medicine , some departments of thought and study peculiarly exciting to the imagination . Such is anatomy , with its sad yet instructive revelations of the structure of the human frame — so “ fearfully and wonderfully made ” — wielding in its hand a scalpel which at first seems ruthless and disenchanting as the scythe of death , but which afterwards becomes a key to unlock some of the deepest mysteries , and leads us down whole galleries of wonder . There is botany , culling from every nook and corner of the earth weeds which are flowers , and flowers of all hues , and every plant , from the “ cedar of Lebanon to the hyssop which springs out of the wall , ” and finding a terrible and imaginative pleasure in handling the fell family of poisons , and in deriving the means of protracting life and healing sickness from the very blossoms of death . And there is chemistry , most poetical save astronomy of all the sciences , seeking to spiritualise the material — to hunt the atom to the point where it trembles over the gulf of nonentity — to weigh gases in scales , and the elements in a balance , and , in its more transcendental and daring shape , trying to interchange one kind of metal with another , and all kinds of forms with all , as in a music-led and mystic dance . Hence we find that such men as Beddoes , the author of the “ Bride 's Tragedy , ” have turned away from poetry to physiology , and found in it a grander if also ghastlier stimulus to their imaginative faculty . Hence Crabbe delighted to load himself with grasses and duckweed , and Goëthe to fill his carriage with every variety of plant and mountain flower . Hence Davy , and the late lamented Samuel Brown , analysed , in the spirit of poets as well as of philosophers , and gave to the crucible what it had long lost , something of the air of a weird cauldron , bubbling over with magical foam , and shining , not so much in the severe light of science as in the</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Light that never was on sea or shore .</l>
     <l n="2">The consecration and the poet 's dream . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And hence , in the then state of Church matters , and of his own effervescent soul , Akenside felt probably in medicine a deeper charm than in theology , and imagined that it opened up a more congenial field for his powers both of reason and of imagination .</p>
   <p>In December 1740 , Akenside was elected a member of the Edinburgh Medical Society . This society held meetings for discussion , and in them our poet set himself to shine as a speaker . His ambition , it is said , at this time , was to be a member of Parliament ; and Dr. Robertson , then a student in the University , used to attend the meetings of the society chiefly to hear the speeches of the young and fiery Southron . Indeed , the rhetoric of the “ Pleasures of Imagination ” is finer than its poetry ; and none but an orator could have painted Brutus rising “ refulgent from the stroke ” which slew Caesar , when he</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Call 'd on Tully 's name ,</l>
     <l n="2">And bade the father of his country hail ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Englishmen are naturally more eloquent than the Scotch ; and once and again has the Mark Akenside , the Joseph Gerald , or the George Thompson overpowered and captivated even the sober and critical children of the Modern Athens . While electrifying the Medical Society , Akenside did not neglect , if he did not eminently excel in his professional studies ; and he continued to write sonorous verse , some specimens of which , including an “ Ode on the Winter Solstice , ” and “ Love , an Elegy , ” he is said to have printed for private distribution .</p>
   <p>In Edinburgh he became acquainted with Jeremiah Dyson , a young law-student of fortune , who was afterwards our poet 's principal patron . He seems to have returned to Newcastle in 1741 ; and we find him dating a letter to Dyson thence on the 18th of August 1742 , and directing his correspondent to address his reply to him as “ Surgeon , in Newcastle-upon-Tyne . ” It is doubtful , however , if he had yet begun to practise ; and there is reason to believe that he was busily occupied with his great poem . This he completed in the close of 1743 . He offered the manuscript to Dodsley for £ 150 . The bookseller , although a liberal and generous man , was disposed at first to boggle a little at such a price for a didactic poem by an unknown man . He carried the “ Pleasures of Imagination ” to Pope , who glanced at it , saw its merit , and advised Dodsley not to make a niggardly offer — for “ this was no everyday writer . ” It appeared in January 1744 , and , in spite of its faults , nay , perhaps , partly in consequence of them , was received with loud applause ; and the author — only twenty-three years of age — “ awoke one morning , and found himself famous ; ” for although his name was not attached to the poem , it soon transpired . One Rolt , an obscure scribbler , then in Ireland , claimed the authorship , transcribed the poem with his own hand ; nay , according to Dr. Johnson , published an edition with his own name , and was invited to the best tables as the ingenious Mr. Rolt . His conversation did not indeed sparkle with poetic fire , nor was his appearance that of a poet , but people remembered that both Dryden and Addison were dull or silent in company till warmed with wine , and that it was not uncommon for authors to have sold all their thoughts to their booksellers . Akenside , hearing of this , was obliged to vindicate his claims by printing the next edition with his name , and then the bubble of the ingenious Mr. Rolt burst .</p>
   <p>All fame , and especially all sudden fame , has its drawbacks . Gray read the poem , and wrote of it to his friends , in a style thought at the time depreciatory , although it comes pretty near the truth . He says , “ It seems to me above the middling , and now and then for a little while rises even to the best , particularly in description . It is often obscure and even unintelligible . In short , its great fault is , that it was published at least nine years too early . ” Gray , however , had not as yet himself emerged as a poet , and his word had chiefly weight with his friends . Warburton was a more formidable opponent . This divine acted then a good deal in the style of a gigantic Church-bully , and seemed disposed to knock down all and sundry who differed from him either on great or small theological matters ; and Humes , Churchills , Jortins , Middletons , Lowths , Shaftesburys , Wesleys , Whitefields , and Akensides all felt the fury of his onset , and the force of the “ punishment ” inflicted by his strong fists . Akenside , in his poem , and in one of his notes , had defended Shaftesbury 's ridiculous notion that ridicule is the test of truth , and for this Warburton assailed him in the preface to “ Remarks in Answer to Dr. Middleton . ” In this , while indirectly disparaging the poem , he accuses the poet of infidelity , atheism , and insulting the clergy . The preface appeared in March 1744 , and in the following May ( Akenside being then in Holland ) came forth a reply , in “ An Epistle to the Rev . Mr. Warburton , occasioned by his Treatment of the Author of the Pleasures of Imagination , ” which had been concocted between Dyson and our poet . This pamphlet was written with considerable spirit ; and although it left the question where it found it , it augured no little courage on the part of the young physician and the young lawyer mating themselves against the matured author of the “ Divine Legation of Moses . ” As to the question in dispute , Johnson disposes of it satisfactorily in a single sentence . “ If ridicule be applied to any position as the test of truth , it will then become a question whether such ridicule be just , and this can only be decided by the application of truth as the test of ridicule . ” How easy to make any subject or any person ridiculous ! To hold that ridicule is paramount to the discovery or attestation of truth , is to exalt the ape-element in man above the human and the angelic principles , which also belong to his nature , and to enthrone a Voltaire over a Newton or a Milton . Those who laugh proverbially do not always win , nor do they always deserve to win . Do we think less of “ Paradise Lost , ” and Shakspeare , because Cobbett has derided both , or of the Old and New Testaments , because Paine has subjected parts of them to his clumsy satire ? When we find , indeed , a system such as Jesuitism blasted by the ridicule of Pascal , we conclude that it was not true ,— but why ? not merely because ridicule assailed it , for ridicule has assailed ten thousand systems which never even shook in the storm , but because , in the view of all candid and liberal thinkers , the ridicule prevailed . Should it be said that the question still recurs , How are we to be certain of the candour and liberality of the men who think that Pascal 's satire damaged Jesuitism ? we simply say , that it is not ridicule , but some stricter and more satisfactory method that can determine this inquiry . It is remarkable that Akenside modified his statements on this subject in his after revision of his poem .</p>
   <p>In April 1744 we find our bard in Leyden , and Mr. Dyce has published some interesting letters dated thence to Mr. Dyson . He does not seem to have admired Holland much , whether in its scenery , manners , taste , or genius . On the 16th of May , he took his degree of Doctor of Physic at Leyden , the subject of his Dissertation ( which , according to the usual custom , he published ) being the “ Origin and Growth of the Human Foetus , ” in which he is reported to have opposed the views then prevalent , and to have maintained the theory which is now generally held . As soon as he received his diploma he returned to England , signalising his departure by an “ Ode to Holland , ” as dull as any ditch in that country itself . In June he settled as a physician in Northampton , where the eminent Doddridge was at the time labouring . With him he is said to have held a friendly contest about the opinions of the old heathens in reference to a future state , Akenside , in keeping with the whole tenor of his intellectual history , supporting the side of the ancients . Indeed , he never appears to have had much religion , except that of the Pagan philosophy , Plato being his Paul , and Socrates his Christ ; and most cordially would he have joined in Thorwaldsen 's famous toast ( announced at an evening party in Rome , while the planet Jupiter was shining in great glory ) , “ Here 's in honour of the ancient gods . ” In Northampton , partly owing to the overbearing influence of Dr. Stonehouse , a long-established practitioner , and partly to his violent political zeal , he did not prosper . While residing there he produced his manly and spirited “ Epistle to Curio . ” Curio was Pulteney , who had been a flaming patriot , but who , like the majority of such characters , had , for the sake of a title — the earldom of Bath — subsided into a courtier . Him Akenside lashes with unsparing energy . He committed afterwards an egregious blunder in reference to this production . He frittered it down into a stupid ode . Indeed , he had always an injudicious trick — whether springing from fastidiousness or undue ambition — of tinkering and tampering with his very best poems .</p>
   <p>In March 1745 he collected his odes into a quarto tract . It appeared at a time when lyrical poetry was all but extinct . Dryden was gone ; Collins and Gray had not yet published their odes ; and hence , and partly too from the prestige of his former poem , Akenside 's odes , poor as they now seem , met with considerable acceptance , although they did not reach a new edition till 1760 . In 1747 his friend Dyson , having been elected clerk to the House of Commons , took Akenside with him to his house at Northend , Hampstead . Here , however , he felt himself out of place , and in fine , in 1748 , he settled down in Bloomsbury Square , London , where Dyson very generously allowed him £ 300 a-year , which , being equal to the value of twice that sum now , enabled him to keep a chariot , and live like a gentleman . During the years 1746 , 1747 , 1748 , he composed a number of pieces , both in prose and verse — his “ Hymn to the Naiads , ” his “ Ode to the Evening Star , ” and several essays in Dodsley 's Museum ; such as these , “ On Correctness ; ” “ The Table of Modern Fame , a Vision ; ” “ Letter from a Swiss Gentleman on English Liberty ; ” and “ The Balance of Poets ; ” besides an ode to Caleb Hardinge , M. D ., and another to the Earl of Huntingdon , which has been esteemed one of his best lyric poems . In London he did not attain rapidly a good practice , nor was it ever extensive . But for Mr. Dyson 's aid he might have written a chapter on “ Early Struggles , ” nearly as rich and interesting as that famous one in Warren 's “ Diary of a late Physician . ” Even his poetical name was adverse to his prospects . His manners , too , were unconciliating and haughty . At Tom 's Coffeehouse , in Devereux Court , night after night , appeared the author of the “ Pleasures of Imagination , ” full of knowledge , dogmatism , and a love of self-display ; eager for talk , fond of arguing — especially on politics and literature — and sometimes narrowly escaping duels and other misadventures springing from his hot and imperious temper . In sick chambers he was stiff , formal , and reserved , carrying a frown about with him , which itself damped the spirits and accelerated the pulse of his patients . It was only among intimate friends that he descended to familiarity , and even then it was with</p>
   <p>“ Compulsion and laborious flight . ”</p>
   <p>One of these intimates for a while was Charles Townshend , a man whose name now lives chiefly in the glowing encomium of Burke , a part of which we may quote :— “ Before this splendid orb ( Lord Chatham ) was entirely set , and while the western horizon was in a blaze with his descending glory , on the opposite quarter of the heavens arose another luminary , and for his hour became lord of the ascendant . Townshend was the delight and ornament of this House , and the charm of every private society which he honoured with his presence . Perhaps there never arose in this country , nor in any country , a man of more pointed and finished wit , and of a more refined , exquisite , and penetrating judgment . He stated his matter skilfully and powerfully . He particularly excelled in a most luminous explanation and display of the subject . His style of argument was neither trite and vulgar , nor subtle and abstruse . He hit the House between wind and water . He had no failings which were not owing to a noble cause , to an ardent , generous , perhaps an immoderate passion for fame ; a passion which is the instinct of all great souls . He worshipped that goddess wheresoever she appeared : but he paid his particular devotions to her in her favourite habitation , in her chosen temple , the House of Commons . ” With this distinguished man Akenside was for some time on friendly terms , but for causes not well known , their friendship came to an abrupt termination ; it might have been owing to Townshend 's rapid rise , or to Akenside 's presumptuous and overbearing disposition . Two odes , addressed by the latter to the former , immortalise this incomplete and abortive amity .</p>
   <p>The years 1750 and 1751 were only signalised in Akenside 's history by one or two dull odes from his pen . But if not witty at that time himself , he gave occasion to wit in others . Smollett , provoked , it is said , by some aspersions Akenside had in conversation cast on Scotland , and at all times prone to bitter and sarcastic views of men and manners , fell foul of him in “ Peregrine Pickle . ” If our readers care for wading through that filthy novel — the most disagreeable , although not the dullest of Smollett 's fictions — they will find a caricature of our poet in the character of the “ Doctor , ” who talks nonsense about liberty , quotes and praises his own poetry , and invites his friends to an entertainment in the manner of the ancients — a feast hideously accurate in its imitation of antique cookery , and forming , if not an “ entertainment ” to the guests , a very rich one to the readers of the tale . How Akenside bore this we are not particularly informed . Probably he writhed in secret , but was too proud to acknowledge his feelings . In 1753 he was consoled by receiving a doctor 's degree from Cambridge , and by being elected Fellow of the Royal Society . The next year he became Fellow of the College of Physicians .</p>
   <p>In June 1755 he read the Galstonian lectures in anatomy before the College of Physicians , and in the next year the Croonian lectures before the same institution . The subject of the latter course was the “ History of the Revival of Letters , ” which some of the learned Thebans thought not germane to the matter ; and , consequently , after he had delivered three lectures , he desisted in disgust . This fact seems somewhat to contradict Dr. Johnson 's assertion , that “ Akenside appears not to have been wanting to his own success , and placed himself in view by all the common methods . ” Had he been a thoroughly self-seeking man , he never would have committed the blunder of choosing literature as a subject of predilection to men who were probably most of them materialists , or at least destitute of literary taste . The Doctor says also , “ He very eagerly forced himself into notice , by an ambitious ostentation of elegance and literature . ” But surely the author of such a popular poem as the “ Pleasures of Imagination ” had no need to claim notice by an ostentatious display of his parts , and had too much good sense to imagine that such a vain display would conciliate any acute and sensible person . Johnson , in fact , throughout his cursory and careless “ Life of Akenside , ” is manifestly labouring under deep prejudice against the poet — prejudice founded chiefly on Akenside 's political sentiments .</p>
   <p>In 1759 our poet was appointed physician to St. Thomas 's Hospital , and afterwards to Christ 's Hospital . Here he ruled the patients and the under officials with a rod of iron . Dr. Lettsom became a surgeon 's dresser in St. Thomas 's Hospital . He was an admirer of poetry , especially of the “ Pleasures of Imagination , ” and anticipated much delight from intercourse with the author . He was disappointed first of all with his personal appearance . He found him a stiff-limbed , starched personage , with a lame foot , a pale strumous face , a long sword , and a large white wig . Worse than this , he was cruel , almost barbarous , to the patients , particularly to females . Owing to an early love-disappointment , he had contracted a disgust and aversion to the sex , and chose to express it in a callous and cowardly harshness to those under his charge . It is possible , however , that Lettsom might be influenced by some private pique . Nothing is more common than for the hero-worshipper , disenchanted of his early idolatry , to rush to the opposite extreme , and to become the hero-hater ; and the fault is as frequently his own as that of his idol . And it must be granted that an hospital — especially of that age — was no congenial atmosphere for a poet so Platonic and ideal as Akenside .</p>
   <p>In October 1759 he delivered the Harveian oration before the College of Physicians , and by their order it was published the next year . In 1761 Mr. T. Hollis presented him with a bed which had once belonged to Milton , on the condition that he would write an ode to the memory of that great poet . Akenside joyfully accepted the bed , had it set up in his house , and , we suppose , slept in it ; but the muse forgot to visit his “ slumbers nightly , ” and no ode was ever produced . We think that Akenside had sympathy enough with Milton 's politics and poetry to have written a fine blank-verse tribute to his memory , resembling that of Thomson to Sir Isaac Newton ; but odes of much merit he could not produce , and yet at odes he was always sweltering</p>
   <p>“ With labour dire and weary woe . ”</p>
   <p>In 1760 , George the Third mounted the throne , and the author of the “ Epistle to Curio ” began to follow the precise path of Pulteney . In this he was preceded by Dyson , who became suddenly a supporter of Lord Bute , and drew his friend in his train . By Dyson 's influence Akenside was appointed , in 1761 , physician to the Queen . His secession from the Whig ranks cost him a great deal of obloquy . Dr. Hardinge had told the two turncoats long before “ that , like a couple of idiots , they did not leave themselves a loophole — they could not sidle away into the opposite creed . ” He never , however , became a violent Tory partisan . It is singular how Johnson , with all his aversion to Akenside , has no allusion to his apostasy , in which we might have à priori expected him to glory , as a proof of the poet 's inconsistency , if not corruption .</p>
   <p>In one point Akenside differed from the majority of his tuneful brethren , before , then , or since . He was a warm and wide-hearted commender of the works of other poets . Most of our sweet singers rather resemble birds of prey than nightingales or doves , and are at least as strong in their talons as they are musical in their tongues . And hence the groves of Parnassus have in all ages rung with the screams of wrath and contest , frightfully mingling with the melodies of song . Akenside , by a felicitous conjunction of elements , which you could not have expected from other parts of his character , was entirely exempted from this defect , and not only warmly admired Pope , Young , Thomson , and Dyer , whose “ Fleece ” he corrected , but had kind words to spare for even such “ small deer ” as Welsted and Fenton .</p>
   <p>In 1763 , he read a paper before the Royal Society , on the “ Effects of a Blow on the Heart , ” which was published in the Philosophical Transactions of the year . And , in 1764 he established his character as a medical writer by an elegant and elaborate treatise on “ The Dysentery , ” still , we believe , consulted for its information , and studied for the purity and precision of its Latin style . About this time , too , he commenced a recasting of his “ Pleasures of Imagination , ” which he did not live to finish ; and in which , on the whole , there is more of laborious alteration than of felicitous improvement . In 1766 , Warburton , his old foe , who had now been made a bishop , reprinted , in a new edition of his “ Divine Legation of Moses , ” his attack on Akenside 's notions about ridicule , without deigning to take any notice of the explanations he had given in his reply . This renewal of hostilities , coming , especially as it did , from the vantage ground of the Episcopal bench , enraged our poet , and , by way of rejoinder , he issued a lyrical satire which he had had lying past him in pickle for fifteen years , and which nothing but a fresh provocation would have induced him to publish . It was entitled “ An Ode to the late Thomas Edwards , Esq . ” Edwards had opposed Warburton ably in a book entitled “ Canons of Criticism , ” and was himself a poet . The real sting of this attack lay in Akenside 's production of a letter from Warburton to Concanen , dated 2d January 1726 , which had fallen accidentally into the hands of our poet ; and in which Warburton had accused Addison of plagiarism , and said that when “ Pope borrows it is from want of genius . ” Concanen was one of the “ Dunces , ” and it was , of course , Akenside 's purpose to shew Warburton 's inconsistency in the different opinions he had expressed at different times of them and of their great adversary . We know not if the sturdy bishop took any notice of this ode . Even his Briarean arms were sometimes too full of the controversial work which his overbearing temper and fierce passions were constantly giving him .</p>
   <p>In 1766 , Akenside received the thanks of the College of Physicians for an edition of Harvey 's works , which he prepared for the press , and to which he had prefixed a preface . In June 1767 he read before the College two papers , one on “ Cancers and Asthmas , ” and the other on “ White Swelling of the Joints , ” both of which were published the next year in the first volume of the Medical Transactions . In the same year , one Archibald Campbell , a Scotchman , a purser in the navy , and called , from his ungainly countenance , “ horrible Campbell , ” produced a small jeu d'esprit , entitled “ Lexiphanes , imitated from Lucian , and suited to the present times , ” in which he tries to ridicule Johnson 's prose and Akenside 's poetry . His object was probably to attract their notice , but both passed over this grin of the “ Grim Feature ” in silent contempt . Akenside was still busy with the revisal of his poem , had finished two books , “ made considerable progress with the third , and written a fragment of the fourth ; ” but death stepped in and blighted his prospects , both as a physician , with increasing practice and reputation , and as a poet , whose favourite work was approaching what he deemed perfection . He was seized with putrid fever ; and , after a short illness , died on the 23 d June 1770 at an age when many men are in their very prime , both of body and mind — that of 49 . He died in his house in Burlington Street , and was buried on the 28th in St. James 's Church .</p>
   <p>Akenside had been , notwithstanding his many acquaintances and friends , on the whole , a lonely man ; without domestic connexions , and having , so far as we are informed , either no surviving relations or no intercourse with those who might be still alive . He was not especially loved in society ; he wanted humour and good-humour both , and had little of that frank cordiality which , according to Sidney Smith , “ warms and cheers more than meat or wine . ” He had far less geniality than genius . Yet , in certain select circles , his mind , which was richly stored with all knowledge , opened delightfully , and men felt that he was the author of his splendid poem . One of his biographers gives him the palm for learning , next to Ben Jonson , Milton , and Gray ( he might perhaps have also excepted Landor and Coleridge ) , over all our English poets .</p>
   <p>In 1772 , Mr. Dyson published an edition of his friend 's poems , containing the original form of the “ Pleasures of Imagination , ” as well as its half-finished second shape ; his “ Odes , ” “ Inscriptions , ” “ Hymn to the Naiads , ” etc ., omitting , however , his poem to Curio in its first and best version , and some of his smaller pieces . This edition , too , contained an account of Akenside 's life by his friend , so short and so cold as either to say little for Dyson 's heart , or a great deal for his modesty and reticence . His uniform and munificent kindness to the poet during his lifetime , however , determines us in favour of the latter side of the alternative .</p>
   <p>Of Akenside , as a man , our previous remarks have perhaps indicated our opinion . He was rather a scholar somewhat out of his element , and unreconciled to the world , than a thorough gentleman ; irritable , vehement , and proud — his finer traits were only known to his intimates , who probably felt that in Wordsworth 's words ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ You must love him ere to you</l>
     <l n="2">He doth , seem worthy of your love . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In religion his opinions seem to have been rather unsettled ; but , of whatever doubts he had , he gave the benefit latterly to the Christian side — at least he was ever ready to rebuke noisy and dogmatic infidelity . It is said that he intended to have included the doctrine of immortality in his later version of the “ Pleasures of Imagination ” — and even as the poem is , it contains some transient allusions to that great object of human hope , although none , it must be admitted , to its special Christian grounds .</p>
   <p>We have now a very few sentences to enounce about his poetry , or , more properly speaking , about his two or three good poems , for we must dismiss the most of his odes , in their deep-sounding dulness , as nearly unworthy of their author 's genius . Up to the days of Keats ’ “ Endymion ” and “ Hyperion , ” Akenside 's “ Hymn to the Naiads ” was thought one of the best attempts to reproduce the classical spirit and ideas . It now takes a secondary place ; and at no time could be compared to an actual hymn of Callimachus or Pindar , any more than Smollett 's “ Supper after the Manner of the Ancients ” was equal to a real Roman Coena , the ideal of which Croly has so superbly described in “ Salathiel . ” His “ Epistle to Curio ” is a masterpiece of vigorous composition , terse sentiment , and glowing invective . It gathers around Pulteney as a ring of fire round the scorpion , and leaves him writhing and shrivelled . Out of Dryden and Pope , it is perhaps the best satiric piece in our poetry .</p>
   <p>Of the “ Pleasures of Imagination , ” it is not necessary to say a great deal . A poem that has been so widely circulated , so warmly praised , so frequently quoted and imitated — the whole of which nearly a man like Thomas Brown has quoted in the course of his lectures — must possess no ordinary merit . Its great beauty is its richness of description and language — its great fault is its obscurity ; a beauty and a fault closely connected together , even as the luxuriance of a tropical forest implies intricacy , and its lavish loveliness creates a gloom . His attempt to express Plato 's philosophy in blank verse is not always successful . Perhaps prose might better have answered his purpose in expressing the awfully sublime thought of the “ archetypes of all things existing in God . ” We know that in certain objects of nature — in certain rocks , for instance ( such as Coleridge describes in his “ Wanderings of Cain ” ) — there lie silent prefigurations and aboriginal types of artificial objects , such as ships , temples , and other orders of architecture ; and it is so also in certain shells , woods , and even in clouds . How interesting and beautiful those painted prophecies of nature , those quiet hieroglyphics of God , those mystic letters , which , unlike those on the Babylonian wall , do not ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Careering shake ,</l>
     <l n="2">And blaze IMPATIENT to be read , ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>but bide calmly the time when their artificial archetypes shall appear , and the “ wisdom ” in them shall be “ justified ” in these its children ! So , according to Plato , comparing great to small things , there lay in the Divine mind the archetypes of all that was to be created , with this important difference , that they lay in God spiritually and consciously . How poetical and how solemn to approach , under the guidance of this thought , and gaze on the mind of God as on an ancient awful mirror ; and even as in a clear lake we behold the forms of the surrounding scenery reflected from the white strip of pebbled shore up to the gray scalp of the mountain summit , and tremble as we look down on the “ skies of a far nether world , ” on an inverted sun , and on snow unmelted amidst the water ; so to see the entire history of man , from the first glance of life in the eye of Adam , down to the last sparkle of the last ember of the general conflagration , lying silently and inverted there — how sublime , but at the same time how bewildering and how appalling ! Our readers will find , in the “ Pleasures of Imagination , ” an expansion — perhaps they may think it a dilution — of this Platonic idea .</p>
   <p>They will find there , too , the germ of the famous theory of Alison and Jeffrey about Beauty . These theorists held ‘ that beauty resides not so much in the object as in the mind ; that we receive but what we give ; that our own soul is the urn whence beauty is showered over the universe ; that flower and star are lovely because the mind has breathed on them ; that the imagination and the heart of man are the twin beautifiers of creation ; that the dwelling of beauty is not in the light of setting suns , nor in the beams of morning stars , nor in the waves of summer seas , but in the human spirit ; that sublimity tabernacles not in the palaces of the thunder , walks not on the wings of the wind , rides not on the forked lightning , but that it is the soul which is lifted up there ; that it is the soul which , in its high aspirings , ’</p>
   <p>“ Yokes with whirlwinds and the northern blast , and scatters grandeur around it on its way . ”</p>
   <p>All this seems anticipated , and , as it were , coiled up in the words of our poet :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Mind , mind alone ( bear witness earth and heaven ! )</l>
     <l n="2">The living fountains in itself contains</l>
     <l n="3">Of beauteous and sublime . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">That Akenside was a real poet many expressions in his “ Pleasures of</l>
     <l n="5">Imagination ” prove , such as that just quoted —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">“ Yoked with whirlwinds and the northern blast</l>
     <l n="7">Sweeps the long tract of day ; ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>but , taking his poem as a whole , it is rather a tissue of eloquence and philosophical declamation than of imagination . He deals rather in sheet lightning than in forked flashes . As a didactic poem it has a high , but not the highest place . It must not be named beside the “ De Rerum Natura ” of Lucretius , or the “ Georgics ” of Virgil , or the “ Night Thoughts ” of Young ; and in poetry , yields even to the “ Queen Mab ” of Shelley . It ranks high , however , amongst that fine class of works which have called themselves , by no misnomer , “ Pleasures ; ” and to recount all the names of which were to give an “ enumeration of sweets ” as delightful as that in “ Don Juan . ” How cheering to think of that beautiful bead-roll — of which the “ Pleasures of Memory , ” “ Pleasures of Hope , ” “ Pleasures of Melancholy , ” “ Pleasures of Imagination , ” are only a few ! We may class , too , with them , Addison 's essays on the “ Pleasures of Imagination ” in The Spectator , which , although in prose , glow throughout with the mildest and truest spirit of poetry ; and if inferior to Akenside in richness and swelling pomp of words , and in dashing rhetorical force , far excel him in clearness , in chastened beauty , and in those inimitable touches and unconscious felicities of thought and expression which drop down , like ripe apples falling suddenly across your path from a laden bough , and which could only have proceeded from Addison 's exquisite genius .</p>

   <p>THE PLEASURES OF IMAGINATION .</p>
   <p>A POEM , IN THREE BOOKS .</p>
   <p>[ Greek : ‘ Asebous men ‘ estin ‘ anthropou tas para tou theou charitas ‘ atimazein . ] EPICT . apud Arrian . II . 23 .</p>
   <p>THE DESIGN .</p>
   <p>There are certain powers in human nature which seem to hold a middle place between the organs of bodily sense and the faculties of moral perception : they have been called by a very general name , the Powers of Imagination . Like the external senses , they relate to matter and motion ; and , at the same time , give the mind ideas analogous to those of moral approbation and dislike . As they are the inlets of some of the most exquisite pleasures with which we are acquainted , it has naturally happened that men of warm and sensible tempers have sought means to recall the delightful perceptions which they afford , independent of the objects which originally produced them . This gave rise to the imitative or designing arts ; some of which , as painting and sculpture , directly copy the external appearances which were admired in nature ; others , as music and poetry , bring them back to remembrance by signs universally established and understood .</p>
   <p>But these arts , as they grew more correct and deliberate , were , of course , led to extend their imitation beyond the peculiar objects of the imaginative powers ; especially poetry , which , making use of language as the instrument by which it imitates , is consequently become an unlimited representative of every species and mode of being . Yet as their intention was only to express the objects of imagination , and as they still abound chiefly in ideas of that class , they , of course , retain their original character ; and all the different pleasures which they excite , are termed , in general , Pleasures of Imagination .</p>
   <p>The design of the following poem is to give a view of these in the largest acceptation of the term ; so that whatever our imagination feels from the agreeable appearances of nature , and all the various entertainment we meet with , either in poetry , painting , music , or any of the elegant arts , might be deducible from one or other of those principles in the constitution of the human mind which are here established and explained .</p>
   <p>In executing this general plan , it was necessary first of all to distinguish the imagination from our other faculties ; and in the next place to characterise those original forms or properties of being , about which it is conversant , and which are by nature adapted to it , as light is to the eyes , or truth to the understanding . These properties Mr. Addison had reduced to the three general classes of greatness , novelty , and beauty ; and into these we may analyse every object , however complex , which , properly speaking , is delightful to the imagination . But such an object may also include many other sources of pleasure ; and its beauty , or novelty , or grandeur , will make a stronger impression by reason of this concurrence . Besides which , the imitative arts , especially poetry , owe much of their effect to a similar exhibition of properties quite foreign to the imagination , insomuch that in every line of the most applauded poems , we meet with either ideas drawn from the external senses , or truths discovered to the understanding , or illustrations of contrivance and final causes , or , above all the rest , with circumstances proper to awaken and engage the passions . It was , therefore , necessary to enumerate and exemplify these different species of pleasure ; especially that from the passions , which , as it is supreme in the noblest work of human genius , so being in some particulars not a little surprising , gave an opportunity to enliven the didactic turn of the poem , by introducing an allegory to account for the appearance .</p>
   <p>After these parts of the subject which hold chiefly of admiration , or naturally warm and interest the mind , a pleasure of a very different nature , that which arises from ridicule , came next to be considered . As this is the foundation of the comic manner in all the arts , and has been but very imperfectly treated by moral writers , it was thought proper to give it a particular illustration , and to distinguish the general sources from which the ridicule of characters is derived . Here , too , a change of style became necessary ; such a one as might yet be consistent , if possible , with the general taste of composition in the serious parts of the subject : nor is it an easy task to give any tolerable force to images of this kind , without running either into the gigantic expressions of the mock heroic , or the familiar and poetical raillery of professed satire ; neither of which would have been proper here .</p>
   <p>The materials of all imitation being thus laid open , nothing now remained but to illustrate some particular pleasures which arise either from the relations of different objects one to another , or from the nature of imitation itself . Of the first kind is that various and complicated resemblance existing between several parts of the material and immaterial worlds , which is the foundation of metaphor and wit . As it seems in a great measure to depend on the early association of our ideas , and as this habit of associating is the source of many pleasures and pains in life , and on that account bears a great share in the influence of poetry and the other arts , it is therefore mentioned here , and its effects described . Then follows a general account of the production of these elegant arts , and of the secondary pleasure , as it is called , arising from the resemblance of their imitations to the original appearances of nature . After which , the work concludes with some reflections on the general conduct of the powers of imagination , and on their natural and moral usefulness in life .</p>
   <p>Concerning the manner or turn of composition which prevails in this piece , little can be said with propriety by the author . He had two models ; that ancient and simple one of the first Grecian poets , as it is refined by Virgil in the Georgics , and the familiar epistolary way of Horace . This latter has several advantages . It admits of a greater variety of style ; it more readily engages the generality of readers , as partaking more of the air of conversation ; and , especially with the assistance of rhyme , leads to a closer and more concise expression . Add to this the example of the most perfect of modern poets , who has so happily applied this manner to the noblest parts of philosophy , that the public taste is in a great measure formed to it alone . Yet , after all , the subject before us , tending almost constantly to admiration and enthusiasm , seemed rather to demand a more open , pathetic , and figured style . This , too , appeared more natural , as the author 's aim was not so much to give formal precepts , or enter into the way of direct argumentation , as , by exhibiting the most engaging prospects of nature , to enlarge and harmonise the imagination , and by that means insensibly dispose the minds of men to a similar taste and habit of thinking in religion , morals , and civil life . ‘ Tis on this account that he is so careful to point out the benevolent intention of the Author of Nature in every principle of the human constitution here insisted on ; and also to unite the moral excellencies of life in the same point of view with the mere external objects of good taste ; thus recommending them in common to our natural propensity for admiring what is beautiful and lovely . The same views have also led him to introduce some sentiments which may perhaps be looked upon as not quite direct to the subject ; but since they bear an obvious relation to it , the authority of Virgil , the faultless model of didactic poetry , will best support him in this particular . For the sentiments themselves he makes no apology .</p>

     <l n="312">For Beauty 's honour 'd image . Hither turn</l>
     <l n="313">Thy graceful footsteps ; hither , gentle maid ,</l>
     <l n="314">Incline thy polish 'd forehead : let thy eyes</l>
     <l n="315">Effuse the mildness of their azure dawn ;</l>
     <l n="316">And may the fanning breezes waft aside</l>
     <l n="317">Thy radiant locks : disclosing , as it bends</l>
     <l n="318">With airy softness from the marble neck ,</l>
     <l n="319">The cheek fair-blooming , and the rosy lip ,</l>
     <l n="320">Where winning smiles and pleasures sweet as love , 320</l>

     <l n="328">That wakes in Zephyr 's arms the blushing May ,</l>
     <l n="329">Moves onward ; or as Venus , when she stood</l>
     <l n="330">Effulgent on the pearly car , and smiled , 330</l>
     <l n="331">Fresh from the deep , and conscious of her form ,</l>

     <l n="337">Of young desire with rival steps pursue</l>
     <l n="338">This charm of Beauty , if the pleasing toil</l>
     <l n="339">Can yield a moment 's respite , hither turn</l>
     <l n="340">Your favourable ear , and trust my words . 340</l>
     <l n="341">I do not mean to wake the gloomy form</l>

     <l n="343">To damp your tender hopes ; I do not mean</l>
     <l n="344">To bid the jealous thunderer fire the heavens ,</l>

     <l n="346">To fright you from your joys : my cheerful song</l>

     <l n="348">Pleased with your generous ardour in the chase ,</l>
     <l n="349">And warm like you . Then tell me , for ye know ,</l>
     <l n="350">Does Beauty ever deign to dwell where health 350</l>
     <l n="351">And active use are strangers ? Is her charm</l>
     <l n="352">Confess 'd in aught , whose most peculiar ends</l>
     <l n="353">Are lame and fruitless ? Or did Nature mean</l>
     <l n="354">This pleasing call the herald of a lie ,</l>
     <l n="355">To hide the shame of discord and disease ,</l>
     <l n="356">And catch with fair hypocrisy the heart</l>
     <l n="357">Of idle faith ? Oh , no ! with better cares</l>
     <l n="358">The indulgent mother , conscious how infirm</l>
     <l n="359">Her offspring tread the paths of good and ill ,</l>
     <l n="360">By this illustrious image , in each kind 360</l>
     <l n="361">Still most illustrious where the object holds</l>
     <l n="362">Its native powers most perfect , she by this</l>
     <l n="363">Illumes the headstrong impulse of desire ,</l>
     <l n="364">And sanctifies his choice . The generous glebe</l>
     <l n="365">Whose bosom smiles with verdure , the clear tract</l>
     <l n="366">Of streams delicious to the thirsty soul ,</l>
     <l n="367">The bloom of nectar 'd fruitage ripe to sense ,</l>
     <l n="368">And every charm of animated things ,</l>
     <l n="369">Are only pledges of a state sincere ,</l>
     <l n="370">The integrity and order of their frame , 370</l>
     <l n="371">When all is well within , and every end</l>
     <l n="372">Accomplish 'd . Thus was Beauty sent from heaven ,</l>
     <l n="373">The lovely ministries of Truth and Good</l>
     <l n="374">In this dark world : for Truth and Good are one ,</l>
     <l n="375">And Beauty dwells in them , [ Endnote F ] and they in her ,</l>
     <l n="376">With like participation . Wherefore then ,</l>
     <l n="377">O sons of earth ! would ye dissolve the tie ?</l>
     <l n="378">Oh ! wherefore , with a rash impetuous aim ,</l>
     <l n="379">Seek ye those flowery joys with which the hand</l>
     <l n="380">Of lavish Fancy paints each flattering scene 380</l>
     <l n="381">Where Beauty seems to dwell , nor once inquire</l>
     <l n="382">Where is the sanction of eternal Truth ,</l>
     <l n="383">Or where the seal of undeceitful Good ,</l>
     <l n="384">To save your search from folly ! Wanting these ,</l>
     <l n="385">Lo ! Beauty withers in your void embrace ,</l>
     <l n="386">And with the glittering of an idiot 's toy</l>
     <l n="387">Did Fancy mock your vows . Nor let the gleam</l>
     <l n="388">Of youthful hope that shines upon your hearts ,</l>
     <l n="389">Be chill 'd or clouded at this awful task ,</l>
     <l n="390">To learn the lore of undeceitful Good , 390</l>
     <l n="391">And Truth eternal . Though the poisonous charms</l>
     <l n="392">Of baleful Superstition guide the feet</l>
     <l n="393">Of servile numbers , through a dreary way</l>
     <l n="394">To their abode , through deserts , thorns , and mire ;</l>
     <l n="395">And leave the wretched pilgrim all forlorn</l>
     <l n="396">To muse at last , amid the ghostly gloom</l>
     <l n="397">Of graves , and hoary vaults , and cloister 'd cells ;</l>
     <l n="398">To walk with spectres through the midnight shade ,</l>
     <l n="399">And to the screaming owl 's accursed song</l>
     <l n="400">Attune the dreadful workings of his heart ; 400</l>
     <l n="401">Yet be not ye dismay 'd . A gentler star</l>
     <l n="402">Your lovely search illumines . From the grove</l>
     <l n="403">Where Wisdom talk 'd with her Athenian sons ,</l>
     <l n="404">Could my ambitious hand entwine a wreath</l>
     <l n="405">Of Plato 's olive with the Mantuan bay ,</l>
     <l n="406">Then should my powerful verse at once dispel</l>
     <l n="407">Those monkish horrors : then in light divine</l>
     <l n="408">Disclose the Elysian prospect , where the steps</l>
     <l n="409">Of those whom Nature charms , through blooming walks ,</l>
     <l n="410">Through fragrant mountains and poetic streams , 410</l>
     <l n="411">Amid the train of sages , heroes , bards ,</l>
     <l n="412">Led by their winged Genius , and the choir</l>
     <l n="413">Of laurell 'd science and harmonious art ,</l>
     <l n="414">Proceed exulting to the eternal shrine ,</l>
     <l n="415">Where Truth conspicuous with her sister-twins ,</l>
     <l n="416">The undivided partners of her sway ,</l>
     <l n="417">With Good and Beauty reigns . Oh , let not us ,</l>
     <l n="418">Lull 'd by luxurious Pleasure 's languid strain ,</l>
     <l n="419">Or crouching to the frowns of bigot rage ,</l>
     <l n="420">Oh , let us not a moment pause to join 420</l>
     <l n="421">That godlike band . And if the gracious Power</l>
     <l n="422">Who first awaken 'd my untutor 'd song ,</l>

     <l n="424">The tuneful spirit ; then through all our paths ,</l>
     <l n="425">Ne'er shall the sound of this devoted lyre</l>
     <l n="426">Be wanting ; whether on the rosy mead ,</l>
     <l n="427">When summer smiles , to warn the melting heart</l>
     <l n="428">Of luxury 's allurement ; whether firm</l>
     <l n="429">Against the torrent and the stubborn hill</l>
     <l n="430">To urge bold Virtue 's unremitted nerve , 430</l>
     <l n="431">And wake the strong divinity of soul</l>
     <l n="432">That conquers chance and fate ; or whether struck</l>
     <l n="433">For sounds of triumph , to proclaim her toils</l>
     <l n="434">Upon the lofty summit , round her brow</l>
     <l n="435">To twine the wreath of incorruptive praise ;</l>
     <l n="436">To trace her hallow 'd light through future worlds ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="438">Thus with a faithful aim have we presumed ,</l>
     <l n="439">Adventurous , to delineate Nature 's form ;</l>
     <l n="440">Whether in vast , majestic pomp array 'd , 440</l>
     <l n="441">Or dress 'd for pleasing wonder , or serene</l>
     <l n="442">In Beauty 's rosy smile . It now remains ,</l>
     <l n="443">Through various being 's fair proportion 'd scale ,</l>
     <l n="444">To trace the rising lustre of her charms ,</l>
     <l n="445">From their first twilight , shining forth at length</l>
     <l n="446">To full meridian splendour . Of degree</l>
     <l n="447">The least and lowliest , in the effusive warmth</l>
     <l n="448">Of colours mingling with a random blaze ,</l>
     <l n="449">Doth Beauty dwell . Then higher in the line</l>
     <l n="450">And variation of determined shape , 450</l>
     <l n="451">Where Truth 's eternal measures mark the bound</l>
     <l n="452">Of circle , cube , or sphere . The third ascent</l>
     <l n="453">Unites this varied symmetry of parts</l>
     <l n="454">With colour 's bland allurement ; as the pearl</l>
     <l n="455">Shines in the concave of its azure bed ,</l>
     <l n="456">And painted shells indent their speckled wreath .</l>
     <l n="457">Then more attractive rise the blooming forms</l>
     <l n="458">Through which the breath of Nature has infused</l>
     <l n="459">Her genial power to draw with pregnant veins</l>
     <l n="460">Nutritious moisture from the bounteous earth , 460</l>
     <l n="461">In fruit and seed prolific : thus the flowers</l>
     <l n="462">Their purple honours with the Spring resume ;</l>
     <l n="463">And such the stately tree which Autumn bends</l>
     <l n="464">With blushing treasures . But more lovely still</l>
     <l n="465">Is Nature 's charm , where to the full consent</l>

     <l n="467">Of colour , and the vital change of growth ,</l>
     <l n="468">Life 's holy flame and piercing sense are given ,</l>

     <l n="503">In Nature 's fairest forms , is aught so fair</l>
     <l n="504">As virtuous friendship ? as the candid blush</l>
     <l n="505">Of him who strives with fortune to be just ?</l>
     <l n="506">The graceful tear that streams for others ’ woes ?</l>
     <l n="507">Or the mild majesty of private life ,</l>

     <l n="509">The gate ; where Honour 's liberal hands effuse</l>
     <l n="510">Unenvied treasures , and the snowy wings 510</l>
     <l n="511">Of Innocence and Love protect the scene ?</l>
     <l n="512">Once more search , undismay 'd , the dark profound</l>
     <l n="513">Where Nature works in secret ; view the beds</l>
     <l n="514">Of mineral treasure , and the eternal vault</l>
     <l n="515">That bounds the hoary ocean ; trace the forms</l>
     <l n="516">Of atoms moving with incessant change</l>
     <l n="517">Their elemental round ; behold the seeds</l>

     <l n="529">Not reaching to the heart , soon feeble grows</l>

     <l n="18">Peculiar minds ; so haply where the powers</l>
     <l n="19">Of Fancy [ Endnote X ] neither lessen nor enlarge</l>
     <l n="20">The images of things , but paint in all 20</l>
     <l n="21">Their genuine hues , the features which they wore</l>
     <l n="22">In Nature ; there Opinion will be true ,</l>

     <l n="28">Thus her report can never there be true</l>
     <l n="29">Where Fancy cheats the intellectual eye ,</l>
     <l n="30">With glaring colours and distorted lines . 30</l>
     <l n="31">Is there a man , who , at the sound of death ,</l>

     <l n="33">And black before him ; nought but death-bed groans</l>
     <l n="34">And fearful prayers , and plunging from the brink</l>

     <l n="36">An unknown depth ? Alas ! in such a mind ,</l>
     <l n="37">If no bright forms of excellence attend</l>
     <l n="38">The image of his country ; nor the pomp</l>
     <l n="39">Of sacred senates , nor the guardian voice</l>
     <l n="40">Of Justice on her throne , nor aught that wakes 40</l>
     <l n="41">The conscious bosom with a patriot 's flame ;</l>
     <l n="42">Will not Opinion tell him , that to die ,</l>
     <l n="43">Or stand the hazard , is a greater ill</l>
     <l n="44">Than to betray his country ? And in act</l>
     <l n="45">Will he not choose to be a wretch and live ?</l>
     <l n="46">Here vice begins then . From the enchanting cup</l>
     <l n="47">Which Fancy holds to all , the unwary thirst</l>
     <l n="48">Of youth oft swallows a Circaean draught ,</l>

     <l n="52">A furious band that spurn him from the throne ,</l>
     <l n="53">And all is uproar . Thus Ambition grasps</l>
     <l n="54">The empire of the soul ; thus pale Revenge</l>
     <l n="55">Unsheaths her murderous dagger ; and the hands</l>
     <l n="56">Of Lust and Rapine , with unholy arts ,</l>
     <l n="57">Watch to o'erturn the barrier of the laws</l>

   </lg>
   <p>In apologising for the frequent negligences of the sublimest authors of Greece , ‘ Those godlike geniuses , ’ says Longinus , ‘ were well assured , that Nature had not intended man for a low-spirited or ignoble being : but bringing us into life and the midst of this wide universe , as before a multitude assembled at some heroic solemnity , that we might be spectators of all her magnificence , and candidates high in emulation for the prize of glory ; she has therefore implanted in our souls an inextinguishable love of everything great and exalted , of everything which appears divine beyond our comprehension . Whence it comes to pass , that even the whole world is not an object sufficient for the depth and rapidity of human imagination , which often sallies forth beyond the limits of all that surrounds us . Let any man cast his eye through the whole circle of our existence , and consider how especially it abounds in excellent and grand objects , he will soon acknowledge for what enjoyments and pursuits we were destined . Thus by the very propensity of nature we are led to admire , not little springs or shallow rivulets , however clear and delicious , but the Nile , the Rhine , the Danube , and , much more than all , the Ocean , ’ etc . — Dionys .

     <l n="1">‘ The neglect</l>

   </lg>
   <p>It is here said , that in consequence of the love of novelty , objects which at first were highly delightful to the mind , lose that effect by repeated attention to them . But the instance of habit is opposed to this observation ; for there , objects at first distasteful are in time rendered entirely agreeable by repeated attention .</p>
   <p>The difficulty in this case will be removed if we consider , that , when objects at first agreeable , lose that influence by frequently recurring , the mind is wholly passive , and the perception involuntary ; but habit , on the other hand , generally supposes choice and activity accompanying it : so that the pleasure arises here not from the object , but from the mind 's conscious determination of its own activity ; and consequently increases in proportion to the frequency of that determination .</p>
   <p>It will still be urged perhaps , that a familiarity with disagreeable objects renders them at length acceptable , even when there is no room for the mind to resolve or act at all . In this case , the appearance must be accounted for one of these ways .</p>
   <p>The pleasure from habit may be merely negative . The object at first gave uneasiness : this uneasiness gradually wears off as the object grows familiar : and the mind , finding it at last entirely removed , reckons its situation really pleasurable , compared with what it had experienced before .</p>
   <p>The dislike conceived of the object at first , might be owing to prejudice or want of attention . Consequently the mind being necessitated to review it often , may at length perceive its own mistake , and be reconciled to what it had looked on with aversion . In which case , a sort of instinctive justice naturally leads it to make amends for the injury , by running toward the other extreme of fondness and attachment .</p>
   <p>Or lastly , though the object itself should always continue disagreeable , yet circumstances of pleasure or good fortune may occur along with it . Thus an association may arise in the mind , and the object never be remembered without those pleasing circumstances attending it ; by which means the disagreeable impression which it at first occasioned will in time be quite obliterated .</p>

   <p>These two ideas are oft confounded ; though it is evident the mere novelty of an object makes it agreeable , even where the mind is not affected with the least degree of wonder : whereas wonder indeed always implies novelty , being never excited by common or well-known appearances . But the pleasure in both cases is explicable from the same final cause , the acquisition of knowledge and enlargement of our views of nature : on this account it is natural to treat of them together .</p>

     <l n="2">And Beauty dwells in them ’ , etc .— P . 14 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>‘ Do you imagine , ’ says Socrates to Aristippus , ‘ that what is good is not beautiful ? Have you not observed that these appearances always coincide ? Virtue , for instance , in the same respect as to which we call it good , is ever acknowledged to be beautiful also . In the characters of men we always<span corresp="#note1" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>join the two denominations together . The beauty of human bodies corresponds , in like manner , with that economy of parts which constitutes them good ; and in every circumstance of life , the same object is constantly accounted both beautiful and good , inasmuch as it answers the purposes for which it was designed . ’ — Xenophont . Memorab . Socrat . 1. iii. c. 8 .</p>
   <p>This excellent observation has been illustrated and extended by the noble restorer of ancient philosophy . ( See the Characteristics , vol . ii ., pp . 339 and 422 , and vol . iii ., p . 181 . ) And another ingenious author has particularly shewn , that it holds in the general laws of nature , in the works of art , and the conduct of the sciences ( Inquiry into the Original of our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue , treat , i . Section 8 ) . As to the connexion between beauty and truth , there are two opinions concerning it . Some philosophers assert an independent and invariable law in nature , in consequence of which all rational beings must alike perceive beauty in some certain proportions , and deformity in the contrary . And this necessity being supposed the same with that which commands the assent or dissent of the understanding , it follows , of course , that beauty is founded on the universal and unchangeable law of truth .</p>
   <p>But others there are who believe beauty to be merely a relative and arbitrary thing ; that , indeed , it was a benevolent provision in nature to annex so delightful a sensation to those objects which are best and most perfect in themselves , that so we might be engaged to the choice of them at once , and without staying to infer their usefulness from their structure and effects ; but that it is not impossible , in a physical sense , that two beings , of equal capacities for truth , should perceive , one of them beauty , and the other deformity , in the same proportions . And upon this supposition , by that truth which is always connected with beauty , nothing more can be meant than the conformity of any object to those proportions upon which , after careful examination , the beauty of that species is found to depend . Polycletus , for instance , a famous ancient sculptor , from an accurate mensuration of the several parts of the most perfect human bodies , deduced a canon or system of proportions , which was the rule of all succeeding artists . Suppose a statue modelled according to this : a man of mere natural taste , upon looking at it , without entering into its proportions , confesses and admires its beauty ; whereas a professor of the art applies his measures to the head , the neck , or the hand , and , without attending to its beauty , pronounces the workmanship to be just and true .</p>

   <p>About the age of Hugh Capet , founder of the third race of French kings , the poets of Provence were in high reputation ; a sort of strolling bards or rhapsodists , who went about the courts of princes and noblemen , entertaining them at festivals with music and poetry . They attempted both the epic , ode , and satire ; and abounded in a wild and fantastic vein of fable , partly allegorical , and partly founded on traditionary legends of the Saracen wars . These were the rudiments of Italian poetry . But their taste and composition must have been extremely barbarous , as we may judge by those who followed the turn of their fable in much politer times ; such as Boiardo , Bernardo , Tasso , Ariosto , etc .</p>

   <p>Nor were they only losers by the separation . For philosophy itself , to use the words of a noble philosopher , ‘ being thus severed from the sprightly arts and sciences , must consequently grow dronish , insipid , pedantic , useless , and directly opposite to the real knowledge and practice of the world . ’ Insomuch that ‘ a gentleman , ’ says another excellent writer , ‘ cannot easily bring himself to like so austere and ungainly a form : so greatly is it changed from what was once the delight of the finest gentlemen of antiquity , and their recreation after the hurry of public affairs ! From this condition it cannot be recovered but by uniting it once more with the works of imagination ; and we have had the pleasure of observing a very great progress made towards their union in England within these few years . It is hardly possible to conceive them at a greater distance from each other than at the Revolution , when Locke stood at the head of one party , and Dryden of the other . But the general spirit of liberty , which has ever since been growing , naturally invited our men of wit and genius to improve that influence which the arts of persuasion gave them with the people , by applying them to subjects of importance to society . Thus poetry and eloquence became considerable ; and philosophy is now , of course , obliged to borrow of their embellishments , in order even to gain audience with the public .</p>

   <p>As if a man was never pleased in being moved at the distress of a tragedy , without a cool reflection that though these fictitious personages were so unhappy , yet he himself was perfectly at ease and in safety . The ingenious author of the Reflections Critiques sur la Poésie et sur la Peinture accounts for it by the general delight which the mind takes in its own activity , and the abhorrence it feels of an indolent and inattentive state : and this , joined with the moral approbation of its own temper , which attends these emotions when natural and just , is certainly the true foundation of the pleasure , which , as it is the origin and basis of tragedy and epic , deserved a very particular consideration in this poem .</p>

   <p>The account of the economy of Providence here introduced , as the most proper to calm and satisfy the mind when under the compunction of private evils , seems to have come originally from the Pythagorean school : but of the ancient philosophers , Plato has most largely insisted upon it , has established it with all the strength of his capacious understanding , and ennobled it with all the magnificence of his divine imagination . He has one passage so full and clear on this head , that I am persuaded the reader will be pleased to see it here , though somewhat long . Addressing himself to such as are not satisfied concerning divine Providence : ‘ The Being who presides over the whole , ’ says he , ‘ has disposed and complicated all things for the happiness and virtue of the whole , every part of which , according to the extent of its influence , does and suffers what is fit and proper . One of these parts is yours , O unhappy man , which though in itself most inconsiderable and minute , yet being connected with the universe , ever seeks to co-operate with that supreme order . You in the meantime are ignorant of the very end for which all particular natures are brought into existence , that the all-comprehending nature of the whole may be perfect and happy ; existing , as it does , not for your sake , but the cause and reason of your existence , which , as in the symmetry of every artificial work , must of necessity concur with the general design of the artist , and be subservient to the whole of which it is a part . Your complaint therefore is ignorant and groundless ; since , according to the various energy of creation , and the common laws of nature , there is a constant provision of that which is best at the same time for you and for the whole .— For the governing intelligence clearly beholding all the actions of animated and self-moving creatures , and that mixture of good and evil which diversifies them , considered first of all by what disposition of things , and by what situation of each individual in the general system , vice might be depressed and subdued , and virtue made secure of victory and happiness with the greatest facility and in the highest degree possible . In this manner he ordered through the entire circle of being , the internal constitution of every mind , where should be its station in the universal fabric , and through what variety of circumstances it should proceed in the whole tenor of its existence . ’ He goes on in his sublime manner to assert a future state of retribution , ‘ as well for those who , by the exercise of good dispositions being harmonised and assimilated into the divine virtue , are consequently removed to a place of unblemished sanctity and happiness ; as of those who by the most flagitious arts have risen from contemptible beginnings to the greatest affluence and power , and whom you therefore look upon as unanswerable instances of negligence in the gods , because you are ignorant of the purposes to which they are subservient , and in what manner they contribute to that supreme intention of good to the whole . ’ — Plato de Leg . x . 16 .</p>
   <p>This theory has been delivered of late , especially abroad , in a manner which subverts the freedom of human actions ; whereas Plato appears very careful to preserve it , and has been in that respect imitated by the best of his followers .</p>

   <p>The influence of the imagination on the conduct of life is one of the most important points in moral philosophy . It were easy , by an induction of facts , to prove that the imagination directs almost all the passions , and mixes with almost every circumstance of action or pleasure . Let any man , even of the coldest head and soberest industry , analyse the idea of what he calls his interest ; he will find that it consists chiefly of certain degrees of decency , beauty , and order , variously combined into one system , the idol which he seeks to enjoy by labour , hazard , and self-denial . It is , on this account , of the last consequence to regulate these images by the standard of nature and the general good ; otherwise the imagination , by heightening some objects beyond their real excellence and beauty , or by representing others in a more odions or terrible shape than they deserve , may , of course , engage us in pursuits utterly inconsistent with the moral order of things .</p>
   <p>If it be objected that this account of things supposes the passions to be merely accidental , whereas there appears in some a natural and hereditary disposition to certain passions prior to all circumstances of education or fortune , it may be answered , that though no man is born ambitious or a miser , yet he may inherit from his parents a peculiar temper or complexion of mind , which shall render his imagination more liable to be struck with some particular objects , consequently dispose him to form opinions of good and ill , and entertain passions of a particular turn . Some men , for instance , by the original frame of their minds , are more delighted with the vast and magnificent , others , on the contrary , with the elegant and gentle aspects of nature . And it is very remarkable , that the disposition of the moral powers is always similar to this of the imagination ; that those who are most inclined to admire prodigious and sublime objects in the physical world , are also most inclined to applaud examples of fortitude and heroic virtue in the moral . While those who are charmed rather with the delicacy and sweetness of colours , and forms , and sounds , never fail in like manner to yield the preference to the softer scenes of virtue and the sympathies of a domestic life . And this is sufficient to account for the objection .</p>
   <p>Among the ancient philosophers , though we have several hints concerning this influence of the imagination upon morals among the remains of the Socratic school , yet the Stoics were the first who paid it a due attention . Zeno , their founder , thought it impossible to preserve any tolerable regularity in life , without frequently inspecting those pictures or appearances of things , which the imagination offers to the mind ( Diog . Laërt . I . vii . ) The meditations of M. Aurelius , and the discourses of Epictetus , are full of the same sentiment ; insomuch that the latter makes the [ Greek : Chresis oia dei , fantasion ] , or right management of the fancies , the only thing for which we are accountable to Providence , and without which a man is no other than stupid or frantic ( Arrian . I. i. c. 12. and I. ii . c. 22 ) . See also the Characteristics , vol . i. from p. 313 to 321 , where this Stoical doctrine is embellished with all the elegance and graces of Plato .</p>

   <p>By comparing these general sources of ridicule with each other , and examining the ridiculous in other objects , we may obtain a general definition of it , equally applicable to every species . The most important circumstance of this definition is laid down in the lines referred to ; but others more minute we shall subjoin here . Aristotle 's account of the matter seems both imperfect and false . [ Greek : To ghar geloion ] , says he , [ Greek : estin hamartaema ti kai aischos ]: ‘ The ridiculous is some certain fault or turpitude without pain , and not destructive to its subject ’ ( Poet . c. 5 ) . For allowing it to be true , as it is not , that the ridiculous is never accompanied with pain , yet we might produce many instances of such a fault or turpitude which cannot with any tolerable propriety be called ridiculous . So that the definition does not distinguish the thing designed . Nay , further , even when we perceive the turpitude tending to the destruction of its subject , we may still be sensible of a ridiculous appearance , till the ruin become imminent , and the keener sensations of pity or terror banish the ludicrous apprehension from our minds ; for the sensation of ridicule is not a bare perception of the agreement or disagreement of ideas , but a passion or emotion of the mind consequential to that perception ; so that the mind may perceive the agreement or disagreement , and yet not feel the ridiculous , because it is engrossed by a more violent emotion . Thus it happens that some men think those objects ridiculous , to which others cannot endure to apply the name , because in them they excite a much intenser and more important feeling . And this difference , among other causes , has brought a good deal of confusion into this question .</p>
   <p>‘ That which makes objects ridiculous is some ground of admiration or esteem connected with other more general circumstances comparatively worthless or deformed ; or it is some circumstance of turpitude or deformity connected with what is in general excellent or beautiful : the inconsistent properties existing either in the objects themselves , or in the apprehension of the person to whom they relate , belonging always to the same order or class of being , implying sentiment or design , and exciting no acute or vehement emotion of the heart . ’</p>
   <p>To prove the several parts of this definition : ‘ The appearance of excellence or beauty connected with a general condition comparatively sordid or deformed ’ is ridiculous ; for instance , pompous pretensions of wisdom joined with ignorance or folly in the Socrates of Aristophanes , and the ostentations of military glory with cowardice and stupidity in the Thraso of Terence .</p>
   <p>‘ The appearance of deformity or turpitude in conjunction with what is in general excellent or venerable , ’ is also ridiculous : for instance , the personal weaknesses of a magistrate appearing in the solemn and public functions of his station .</p>
   <p>‘ The incongruous properties may either exist in the objects themselves , or in the apprehension of the person to whom they relate : ’ in the last — mentioned instance , they both exist in the objects ; in the instances from Aristophanes and Terence , one of them is objective and real , the other only founded in the apprehension of the ridiculous character .</p>
   <p>‘ The inconsistent properties must belong to the same order or class of being . ’ A coxcomb in fine clothes , bedaubed by accident in foul weather , is a ridiculous object , because his general apprehension of excellence and esteem is referred to the splendour and expense of his dress . A man of sense and merit , in the same circumstances , is not counted ridiculous , because the general ground of excellence and esteem in him is , both in fact and in his own apprehension , of a very different species .</p>
   <p>‘ Every ridiculous object implies sentiment or design . ’ A column placed by an architect without a capital or base is laughed at : the same column in a ruin causes a very different sensation .</p>
   <p>And lastly , ‘ the occurrence must excite no acute or vehement emotion of the heart , ’ such as terror , pity , or indignation ; for in that case , as was observed above , the mind is not at leisure to contemplate the ridiculous . Whether any appearance not ridiculous be involved in this description , and whether it comprehend every species and form of the ridiculous , must be determined by repeated applications of it to particular instances .</p>

   <p>Since it is beyond all contradiction evident that we have a natural sense or feeling of the ridiculous , and since so good a reason may be assigned to justify the supreme Being for bestowing it , one cannot , without astonishment , reflect on the conduct of those men who imagine it is for the service of true religion to vilify and blacken it without distinction , and endeavour to persuade us that it is never applied but in a bad cause . Ridicule is not concerned with mere speculative truth or falsehood . It is not in abstract propositions or theorems , but in actions and passions , good and evil , beauty and deformity , that we find materials for it ; and all these terms are relative , implying approbation or blame . To ask them whether ridicule be a test of truth , is , in other words , to ask whether that which is ridiculous can be morally true , can be just and becoming ; or whether that which is just and becoming can be ridiculous ?— a question that does not deserve a serious answer . For it is most evident , that , as in a metaphysical proposition offered to the understanding for its assent , the faculty of reason examines the terms of the proposition , and finding one idea , which was supposed equal to another , to be in fact unequal , of consequence rejects the proposition as a falsehood ; so , in objects offered to the mind for its esteem or applause , the faculty of ridicule , finding an incongruity in the claim , urges the mind to reject it with laughter and contempt . When , therefore , we observe such a claim obtruded upon mankind , and the inconsistent circumstances carefully concealed from the eye of the public , it is our business , if the matter be of importance to society , to drag out those latent circumstances , and , by setting them in full view , to convince the world how ridiculous the claim is : and thus a double advantage is gained ; for we both detect the moral falsehood sooner than in the way of speculative inquiry , and impress the minds of men with a stronger sense of the vanity and error of its authors . And this , and no more , is meant by the application of ridicule .</p>
   <p>But it is said , the practice is dangerous , and may be inconsistent with the regard we owe to objects of real dignity and excellence . I answer , the practice fairly managed can never be dangerous ; men may be dishonest in obtruding circumstances foreign to the object , and we may be inadvertent in allowing those circumstances to impose upon us : but the sense of ridicule always judges right . The Socrates of Aristophanes is as truly ridiculous a character as ever was drawn : — true ; but it is not the character of Socrates , the divine moralist and father of ancient wisdom . What then ? did the ridicule of the poet hinder the philosopher from detecting and disclaiming those foreign circumstances which he had falsely introduced into his character , and thus rendered the satirist doubly ridiculous in his turn ? No ; but it nevertheless had an ill influence on the minds of the people . And so has the reasoning of Spinoza made many atheists : he has founded it , indeed , on suppositions utterly false ; but allow him these , and his conclusions are unavoidably true . And if we must reject the use of ridicule , because , by the imposition of false circumstances , things may be made to seem ridiculous , which are not so in themselves ; why we ought not in the same manner to reject the use of reason , because , by proceeding on false principles , conclusions will appear true which are impossible in nature , let the vehement and obstinate declaimers against ridicule determine .</p>

   <p>That this account may not appear rather poetically extravagant than just in philosophy , it may be proper to produce the sentiment of one of the greatest , wisest , and best of men on this head ; one so little to be suspected of partiality in the case , that he reckons it among those favours for which he was especially thankful to the gods , that they had not suffered him to make any great proficiency in the arts of eloquence and poetry , lest by that means he should have been diverted from pursuits of more importance to his high station . Speaking of the beauty of universal nature , he observes , that there ‘ is a pleasing and graceful aspect in every object we perceive , ’ when once we consider its connexion with that general order . He instances in many things which at first sight would be thought rather deformities ; and then adds , ‘ that a man who enjoys a sensibility of temper with a just comprehension of the universal order — will discern many amiable things , not credible to every mind , but to those alone who have entered into an honourable familiarity with nature and her works . ’ — M. Antonin . iii . 2 .</p>
   <p>THE</p>
   <p>PLEASURES OF THE IMAGINATION .</p>
   <p>A POEM .</p>
   <p>GENERAL ARGUMENT .</p>
   <p>The pleasures of the imagination proceed either from natural objects , as from a flourishing grove , a clear and murmuring fountain , a calm sea by moonlight ; or from works of art , such as a noble edifice , a musical tune , a statue , a picture , a poem . In treating of these pleasures , we must begin with the former class ; they being original to the other ; and nothing more being necessary , in order to explain them , than a view of our natural inclination toward greatness and beauty , and of those appearances , in the world around us , to which that inclination is adapted . This is the subject of the first book of the following poem .</p>
   <p>But the pleasures which we receive from the elegant arts , from music , sculpture , painting , and poetry , are much more various and complicated . In them ( besides greatness and beauty , or forms proper to the imagination ) we find interwoven frequent representations of truth , of virtue and vice , of circumstances proper to move us with laughter , or to excite in us pity , fear , and the other passions . These moral and intellectual objects are described in the second book ; to which the third properly belongs as an episode , though too large to have been included in it .</p>
   <p>With the above-mentioned causes of pleasure , which are universal in the course of human life , and appertain to our higher faculties , many others do generally occur , more limited in their operation , or of an inferior origin : such are the novelty of objects , the association of ideas , affections of the bodily senses , influences of education , national habits , and the like . To illustrate these , and from the whole to determine the character of a perfect taste , is the argument of the fourth book .</p>
   <p>Hitherto the pleasures of the imagination belong to the human species in general . But there are certain particular men whose imagination is endowed with powers , and susceptible of pleasures , which the generality of mankind never participate . These are the men of genius , destined by nature to excel in one or other of the arts already mentioned . It is proposed , therefore , in the last place , to delineate that genius which in some degree appears common to them all ; yet with a more peculiar consideration of poetry : inasmuch as poetry is the most extensive of those arts , the most philosophical , and the most useful .</p>

    <head>BOOK II . 1765 .</head>
    <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>Introduction to this more difficult part of the subject . Of Truth and its three classes , matter of fact , experimental or scientifical truth ( contra-distinguished from opinion ) , and universal truth ; which last is either metaphysical or geometrical , either purely intellectual or perfectly abstracted . On the power of discerning truth depends that of acting with the view of an end ; a circumstance essential to virtue . Of Virtue , considered in the divine mind as a perpetual and universal beneficence . Of human virtue , considered as a system of particular sentiments and actions , suitable to the design of Providence and the condition of man ; to whom it constitutes the chief good and the first beauty . Of Vice , and its origin . Of Ridicule : its general nature and final cause . Of the Passions ; particularly of those which relate to evil natural or moral , and which are generally accounted painful , though not always unattended with pleasure .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Thus far of Beauty and the pleasing forms</l>
     <l n="2">Which man 's untutor 'd fancy , from the scenes</l>
     <l n="3">Imperfect of this ever changing world ,</l>
     <l n="4">Creates ; and views , enarnour 'd . Now my song</l>
     <l n="5">Severer themes demand : mysterious Truth ;</l>
     <l n="6">And Virtue , sovereign good : the spells , the trains ,</l>
     <l n="7">The progeny of Error ; the dread sway</l>
     <l n="8">Of Passion ; and whatever hidden stores</l>
     <l n="9">From her own lofty deeds and from herself</l>
     <l n="10">The mind acquires . Severer argument : 10</l>
     <l n="11">Not less attractive ; nor deserving less</l>
     <l n="12">A constant ear . For what are all the forms</l>
     <l n="13">Educed by fancy from corporeal things ,</l>
     <l n="14">Greatness , or pomp , or symmetry of parts ?</l>
     <l n="15">Not tending to the heart , soon feeble grows ,</l>
     <l n="16">As the blunt arrow ‘ gainst the knotty trunk ,</l>
     <l n="17">Their impulse on the sense : while the pall 'd eye</l>
     <l n="18">Expects in vain its tribute ; asks in vain ,</l>
     <l n="19">Where are the ornaments it once admired ?</l>
     <l n="20">Not so the moral species , nor the powers 20</l>
     <l n="21">Of Passion and of Thought . The ambitious mind</l>
     <l n="22">With objects boundless as her own desires</l>
     <l n="23">Can there converse : by these unfading forms</l>
     <l n="24">Touch 'd and awaken 'd still , with eager act</l>
     <l n="25">She bends each nerve , and meditates well pleased</l>
     <l n="26">Her gifts , her godlike fortune . Such the scenes</l>
     <l n="27">Now opening round us . May the destined verse</l>
     <l n="28">Maintain its equal tenor , though in tracts</l>
     <l n="29">Obscure and arduous ! May the source of light ,</l>
     <l n="30">All-present , all-sufficient , guide our steps 30</l>
     <l n="31">Through every maze ! and whom , in childish years ,</l>
     <l n="32">From the loud throng , the beaten paths of wealth</l>
     <l n="33">And power , thou didst apart send forth to speak</l>
     <l n="34">In tuneful words concerning highest things ,</l>
     <l n="35">Him still do thou , O Father , at those hours</l>
     <l n="36">Of pensive freedom , when the human soul</l>
     <l n="37">Shuts out the rumour of the world , him still</l>
     <l n="38">Touch thou with secret lessons ; call thou back</l>
     <l n="39">Each erring thought ; and let the yielding strains</l>
     <l n="40">From his full bosom , like a welcome rill 40</l>

     <l n="50">Hath Fate imparted ; but to man alone 50</l>
     <l n="51">Of sublunary beings was it given .</l>
     <l n="52">Each fleeting impulse on the sensual powers</l>
     <l n="53">At leisure to review ; with equal eye</l>

     <l n="61">The avenues of sense ; what laws direct</l>
     <l n="62">Their union ; and what various discords rise ,</l>
     <l n="63">Or fixed , or casual ; which when his clear thought</l>
     <l n="64">Retains and when his faithful words express ,</l>
     <l n="65">That living image of the external scene ,</l>
     <l n="66">As in a polish 'd mirror held to view ,</l>
     <l n="67">Is Truth ; where'er it varies from the shape</l>
     <l n="68">And hue of its exemplar , in that part</l>
     <l n="69">Dim Error lurks . Moreover , from without</l>
     <l n="70">When oft the same society of forms 70</l>
     <l n="71">In the same order have approach 'd his mind ,</l>
     <l n="72">He deigns no more their steps with curious heed</l>
     <l n="73">To trace ; no more their features or their garb</l>
     <l n="74">He now examines ; but of them and their</l>
     <l n="75">Condition , as with some diviner 's tongue ,</l>
     <l n="76">Affirms what Heaven in every distant place ,</l>
     <l n="77">Through every future season , will decree .</l>
     <l n="78">This too is Truth ; where'er his prudent lips</l>
     <l n="79">Wait till experience diligent and slow</l>
     <l n="80">Has authorised their sentence , this is Truth ; 80</l>
     <l n="81">A second , higher kind : the parent this</l>

     <l n="86">The providence of man . Yet oft in vain ,</l>
     <l n="87">To earn her aid , with fix 'd and anxious eye</l>
     <l n="88">He looks on Nature 's and on Fortune 's course :</l>
     <l n="89">Too much in vain . His duller visual ray</l>

     <l n="688">In fancy hurls the thunderbolt of Jove</l>
     <l n="689">To fire the impious wreath on Philip 's brow ,</l>
     <l n="690">Or dash Octavius from the trophied car ; 690</l>
     <l n="691">Say , doth thy secret soul repine to taste</l>
     <l n="692">The big distress ? Or wouldst thou then exchange</l>
     <l n="693">Those heart-ennobling sorrows for the lot</l>
     <l n="694">Of him who sits amid the gaudy herd</l>
     <l n="695">Of silent flatterers bending to his nod ;</l>
     <l n="696">And o'er them , like a giant , casts his eye ,</l>
     <l n="697">And says within himself , ‘ I am a King ,</l>
     <l n="698">And wherefore should the clamorous voice of woe</l>
     <l n="699">Intrude upon mine ear ? ’ The dregs corrupt</l>
     <l n="700">Of barbarous ages , that Circaean draught 700</l>
     <l n="701">Of servitude and folly , have not yet ,</l>
     <l n="702">Bless 'd be the Eternal Ruler of the world !</l>
     <l n="703">Yet have not so dishonour 'd , so deform 'd</l>
     <l n="704">The native judgment of the human soul ,</l>
     <l n="705">Nor so effaced the image of her Sire .</l>

     <l n="1">What tongue then may explain the various fate</l>
     <l n="2">Which reigns o'er earth ? or who to mortal eyes</l>
     <l n="3">Illustrate this perplexing labyrinth</l>
     <l n="4">Of joy and woe , through which the feet of man</l>
     <l n="5">Are doom 'd to wander ? That Eternal Mind</l>
     <l n="6">From passions , wants , and envy far estranged ,</l>
     <l n="7">Who built the spacious universe , and deck 'd</l>
     <l n="8">Each part so richly with whate'er pertains</l>
     <l n="9">To life , to health , to pleasure , why bade he</l>
     <l n="10">The viper Evil , creeping in , pollute 10</l>
     <l n="11">The goodly scene , and with insidious rage ,</l>
     <l n="12">While the poor inmate looks around and smiles</l>
     <l n="13">Dart her fell sting with poison to his soul ?</l>
     <l n="14">Hard is the question , and from ancient days</l>
     <l n="15">Hath still oppress 'd with care the sage 's thought ;</l>
     <l n="16">Hath drawn forth accents from the poet 's lyre</l>
     <l n="17">Too sad , too deeply plaintive ; nor did e'er</l>
     <l n="18">Those chiefs of human kind , from whom the light</l>
     <l n="19">Of heavenly truth first gleam 'd on barbarous lands ,</l>
     <l n="20">Forget this dreadful secret when they told 20</l>
     <l n="21">What wondrous things had to their favour 'd eyes</l>
     <l n="22">And ears on cloudy mountain been reveal 'd ,</l>
     <l n="23">Or in deep cave by nymph or power divine ,</l>
     <l n="24">Portentous oft , and wild . Yet one I know .</l>
     <l n="25">Could I the speech of lawgivers assume ,</l>
     <l n="26">One old and splendid tale I would record ,</l>
     <l n="27">With which the Muse of Solon in sweet strains</l>
     <l n="28">Adorn 'd this theme profound , and render 'd all</l>
     <l n="29">Its darkness , all its terrors , bright as noon ,</l>
     <l n="30">Or gentle as the golden star of eve . 30</l>
     <l n="31">Who knows not Solon ,— last , and wisest far ,</l>
     <l n="32">Of those whom Greece , triumphant in the height</l>
     <l n="33">Of glory , styled her fathers ,— him whose voice</l>
     <l n="34">Through Athens hush 'd the storm of civil wrath ;</l>
     <l n="35">Taught envious Want and cruel Wealth to join</l>
     <l n="36">In friendship ; and , with sweet compulsion , tamed</l>
     <l n="37">Minerva 's eager people to his laws ,</l>
     <l n="38">Which their own goddess in his breast inspired ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="39">‘ Twas now the time when his heroic task</l>
     <l n="40">Seem 'd but perform 'd in vain ; when , soothed by years 40</l>
     <l n="41">Of flattering service , the fond multitude</l>
     <l n="42">Hung with their sudden counsels on the breath</l>
     <l n="43">Of great Pisistratus , that chief renown 'd ,</l>
     <l n="44">Whom Hermes and the Idalian queen had train 'd ,</l>
     <l n="45">Even from his birth , to every powerful art</l>
     <l n="46">Of pleasing and persuading ; from whose lips</l>
     <l n="47">Flow 'd eloquence which , like the vows of love ,</l>
     <l n="48">Could steal away suspicion from the hearts</l>
     <l n="49">Of all who listen 'd . Thus from day to day</l>
     <l n="50">He won the general suffrage , and beheld 50</l>
     <l n="51">Each rival overshadow 'd and depress 'd</l>
     <l n="52">Beneath his ampler state ; yet oft complain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="53">As one less kindly treated , who had hoped</l>
     <l n="54">To merit favour , but submits perforce</l>
     <l n="55">To find another 's services preferr 'd ,</l>
     <l n="56">Nor yet relaxeth aught of faith or zeal .</l>
     <l n="57">Then tales were scatter 'd of his envious foes ,</l>
     <l n="58">Of snares that watch 'd his fame , of daggers aim 'd</l>
     <l n="59">Against his life . At last , with trembling limbs ,</l>
     <l n="60">His hair diffused and wild , his garments loose , 60</l>
     <l n="61">And stain 'd with blood from self-inflicted wounds ,</l>
     <l n="62">He burst into the public place , as there ,</l>
     <l n="63">There only , were his refuge ; and declared</l>
     <l n="64">In broken words , with sighs of deep regret ,</l>
     <l n="65">The mortal danger he had scarce repell 'd .</l>
     <l n="66">Fired with his tragic tale , the indignant crowd ,</l>
     <l n="67">To guard his steps , forthwith a menial band ,</l>
     <l n="68">Array 'd beneath his eye for deeds of war ,</l>
     <l n="69">Decree . Oh ! still too liberal of their trust ,</l>
     <l n="70">And oft betray 'd by over-grateful love , 70</l>
     <l n="71">The generous people ! Now behold him fenced</l>
     <l n="72">By mercenary weapons , like a king ,</l>
     <l n="73">Forth issuing from the city-gate at eve</l>
     <l n="74">To seek his rural mansion , and with pomp</l>
     <l n="75">Crowding the public road . The swain stops short ,</l>
     <l n="76">And sighs ; the officious townsmen stand at gaze ,</l>
     <l n="77">And shrinking give the sullen pageant room .</l>
     <l n="78">Yet not the less obsequious was his brow ;</l>
     <l n="79">Nor less profuse of courteous words his tongue ,</l>
     <l n="80">Of gracious gifts his hand ; the while by stealth , 80</l>
     <l n="81">Like a small torrent fed with evening showers ,</l>
     <l n="82">His train increased ; till , at that fatal time</l>
     <l n="83">Just as the public eye , with doubt and shame</l>
     <l n="84">Startled , began to question what it saw ,</l>
     <l n="85">Swift as the sound of earthquakes rush 'd a voice</l>
     <l n="86">Through Athens , that Pisistratus had fill 'd</l>
     <l n="87">The rocky citadel with hostile arms ,</l>
     <l n="88">Had barr 'd the steep ascent , and sate within</l>
     <l n="89">Amid his hirelings , meditating death</l>
     <l n="90">To all whose stubborn necks his yoke refused . 90</l>
     <l n="91">Where then was Solon ? After ten long years</l>
     <l n="92">Of absence , full of haste from foreign shores ,</l>
     <l n="93">The sage , the lawgiver had now arrived :</l>
     <l n="94">Arrived , alas ! to see that Athens , that</l>
     <l n="95">Fair temple raised by him and sacred call 'd</l>
     <l n="96">To Liberty and Concord , now profaned</l>
     <l n="97">By savage hate , or sunk into a den</l>
     <l n="98">Of slaves who crouch beneath the master 's scourge ,</l>
     <l n="99">And deprecate his wrath , and court his chains .</l>
     <l n="100">Yet did not the wise patriot 's grief impede 100</l>
     <l n="101">His virtuous will , nor was his heart inclined</l>
     <l n="102">One moment with such woman-like distress</l>
     <l n="103">To view the transient storms of civil war ,</l>
     <l n="104">As thence to yield his country and her hopes</l>
     <l n="105">To all-devouring bondage . His bright helm ,</l>
     <l n="106">Even while the traitor 's impious act is told ,</l>
     <l n="107">He buckles on his hoary head ; he girds</l>
     <l n="108">With mail his stooping breast ; the shield , the spear</l>
     <l n="109">He snatcheth ; and with swift indignant strides</l>
     <l n="110">The assembled people seeks ; proclaims aloud 110</l>
     <l n="111">It was no time for counsel ; in their spears</l>
     <l n="112">Lay all their prudence now ; the tyrant yet</l>
     <l n="113">Was not so firmly seated on his throne ,</l>
     <l n="114">But that one shock of their united force</l>
     <l n="115">Would dash him from the summit of his pride ,</l>
     <l n="116">Headlong and grovelling in the dust . ‘ What else</l>
     <l n="117">Can reassert the lost Athenian name ,</l>
     <l n="118">So cheaply to the laughter of the world</l>
     <l n="119">Betray 'd ; by guile beneath an infant 's faith</l>
     <l n="120">So mock 'd and scorn 'd ? Away , then : Freedom now 120</l>
     <l n="121">And Safety dwell not but with Fame in arms ;</l>
     <l n="122">Myself will shew you where their mansion lies ,</l>
     <l n="123">And through the walks of Danger or of Death</l>
     <l n="124">Conduct you to them . ’ — While he spake , through all</l>
     <l n="125">Their crowded ranks his quick sagacious eye</l>
     <l n="126">He darted ; where no cheerful voice was heard</l>
     <l n="127">Of social daring ; no stretch 'd arm was seen</l>
     <l n="128">Hastening their common task : but pale mistrust</l>
     <l n="129">Wrinkled each brow ; they shook their head , and down</l>
     <l n="130">Their slack hands hung ; cold sighs and whisper 'd doubts 130</l>
     <l n="131">From breath to breath stole round . The sage meantime</l>
     <l n="132">Look 'd speechless on , while his big bosom heaved ,</l>
     <l n="133">Struggling with shame and sorrow , till at last</l>
     <l n="134">A tear broke forth ; and , ‘ O immortal shades ,</l>
     <l n="135">O Theseus , ’ he exclaim 'd , ‘ O Codrus , where ,</l>
     <l n="136">Where are ye now behold for what ye toil 'd</l>
     <l n="137">Through life ! behold for whom ye chose to die ! ’</l>
     <l n="138">No more he added ; but with lonely steps</l>
     <l n="139">Weary and slow , his silver beard depress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="140">And his stern eyes bent heedless on the ground , 140</l>
     <l n="141">Back to his silent dwelling he repair 'd .</l>
     <l n="142">There o'er the gate , his armour , as a man</l>
     <l n="143">Whom from the service of the war his chief</l>
     <l n="144">Dismisseth after no inglorious toil ,</l>
     <l n="145">He fix 'd in general view . One wishful look</l>
     <l n="146">He sent , unconscious , toward the public place</l>
     <l n="147">At parting ; then beneath his quiet roof</l>
     <l n="148">Without a word , without a sigh , retired .</l>
     <l n="149">Scarce had the morrow 's sun his golden rays</l>
     <l n="150">From sweet Hymettus darted o'er the fanes 150</l>
     <l n="151">Of Cecrops to the Salaminian shores ,</l>
     <l n="152">When , lo , on Solon 's threshold met the feet</l>
     <l n="153">Of four Athenians , by the same sad care</l>
     <l n="154">Conducted all , than whom the state beheld</l>
     <l n="155">None nobler . First came Megacles , the son</l>
     <l n="156">Of great Alcmaeon , whom the Lydian king ,</l>
     <l n="157">The mild , unhappy Croesus , in his days</l>
     <l n="158">Of glory had with costly gifts adorn 'd ,</l>
     <l n="159">Fair vessels , splendid garments , tinctured webs</l>
     <l n="160">And heaps of treasured gold , beyond the lot 160</l>
     <l n="161">Of many sovereigns ; thus requiting well</l>
     <l n="162">That hospitable favour which erewhile</l>
     <l n="163">Alcmaeon to his messengers had shown ,</l>
     <l n="164">Whom he , with offerings worthy of the god ,</l>
     <l n="165">Sent from his throne in Sardis , to revere</l>
     <l n="166">Apollo 's Delphic shrine . With Megacles</l>
     <l n="167">Approach 'd his son , whom Agarista bore ,</l>
     <l n="168">The virtuous child of Clistheues , whose hand</l>
     <l n="169">Of Grecian sceptres the most ancient far</l>
     <l n="170">In Sicyon sway 'd : but greater fame he drew 170</l>
     <l n="171">From arms controll 'd by justice , from the love</l>
     <l n="172">Of the wise Muses , and the unenvied wreath</l>
     <l n="173">Which glad Olympia gave . For thither once</l>
     <l n="174">His warlike steeds the hero led , and there</l>
     <l n="175">Contended through the tumult of the course</l>
     <l n="176">With skilful wheels . Then victor at the goal ,</l>
     <l n="177">Amid the applauses of assembled Greece ,</l>
     <l n="178">High on his car he stood and waved his arm .</l>
     <l n="179">Silence ensued : when straight the herald 's voice</l>
     <l n="180">Was heard , inviting every Grecian youth , 180</l>
     <l n="181">Whom Clisthenes content might call his son ,</l>
     <l n="182">To visit , ere twice thirty days were pass 'd ,</l>
     <l n="183">The towers of Sicyon . There the chief decreed ,</l>
     <l n="184">Within the circuit of the following year ,</l>
     <l n="185">To join at Hymen 's altar , hand in hand</l>
     <l n="186">With his fair daughter , him among the guests</l>
     <l n="187">Whom worthiest he should deem . Forthwith from all</l>
     <l n="188">The bounds of Greece the ambitious wooers came :</l>
     <l n="189">From rich Hesperia ; from the Illyrian shore ,</l>
     <l n="190">Where Epidamnus over Adria 's surge 190</l>
     <l n="191">Looks on the setting sun ; from those brave tribes</l>
     <l n="192">Chaonian or Molossian , whom the race</l>
     <l n="193">Of great Achilles governs , glorying still</l>
     <l n="194">In Troy o'erthrown ; from rough Aetolia , nurse</l>
     <l n="195">Of men who first among the Greeks threw off</l>
     <l n="196">The yoke of kings , to commerce and to arms</l>
     <l n="197">Devoted ; from Thessalia 's fertile meads ,</l>
     <l n="198">Where flows Penéus near the lofty walls</l>
     <l n="199">Of Cranon old ; from strong Eretria , queen</l>
     <l n="200">Of all Euboean cities , who , sublime 200</l>
     <l n="201">On the steep margin of Euripus , views</l>
     <l n="202">Across the tide the Marathonian plain ,</l>
     <l n="203">Not yet the haunt of glory . Athens too ,</l>
     <l n="204">Minerva 's care , among her graceful sons</l>
     <l n="205">Found equal lovers for the princely maid :</l>
     <l n="206">Nor was proud Argos wanting ; nor the domes</l>
     <l n="207">Of sacred Elis ; nor the Arcadian groves</l>
     <l n="208">That overshade Alpheus , echoing oft</l>
     <l n="209">Some shepherd 's song . But through the illustrious band</l>
     <l n="210">Was none who might with Megacles compare 210</l>
     <l n="211">In all the honours of unblemish 'd youth .</l>
     <l n="212">His was the beauteous bride ; and now their son ,</l>
     <l n="213">Young Clisthenes , betimes , at Solon 's gate</l>
     <l n="214">Stood anxious ; leaning forward on the arm</l>
     <l n="215">Of his great sire , with earnest eyes that ask 'd</l>
     <l n="216">When the slow hinge would turn , with restless feet ,</l>
     <l n="217">And cheeks now pale , now glowing ; for his heart</l>
     <l n="218">Throbb 'd full of bursting passions , anger , grief</l>
     <l n="219">With scorn imbitter 'd , by the generous boy</l>
     <l n="220">Scarce understood , but which , like noble seeds , 220</l>
     <l n="221">Are destined for his country and himself</l>
     <l n="222">In riper years to bring forth fruits divine</l>
     <l n="223">Of liberty and glory . Next appear 'd</l>
     <l n="224">Two brave companions , whom one mother bore</l>
     <l n="225">To different lords ; but whom the better ties</l>
     <l n="226">Of firm esteem and friendship render 'd more</l>
     <l n="227">Than brothers : first Miltiades , who drew</l>
     <l n="228">From godlike Æacus his ancient line ;</l>
     <l n="229">That Æacus whose unimpeach 'd renown</l>
     <l n="230">For sanctity and justice won the lyre 230</l>
     <l n="231">Of elder bards to celebrate him throned</l>
     <l n="232">In Hades o'er the dead , where his decrees</l>
     <l n="233">The guilty soul within the burning gates</l>
     <l n="234">Of Tartarus compel , or send the good</l>
     <l n="235">To inhabit with eternal health and peace</l>
     <l n="236">The valleys of Elysium . From a stem</l>
     <l n="237">So sacred , ne'er could worthier scion spring</l>
     <l n="238">Than this Miltiades ; whose aid ere long</l>
     <l n="239">The chiefs of Thrace , already on their ways ,</l>
     <l n="240">Sent by the inspired foreknowing maid who sits 240</l>
     <l n="241">Upon the Delphic tripod , shall implore</l>
     <l n="242">To wield their sceptre , and the rural wealth</l>
     <l n="243">Of fruitful Chersonesus to protect</l>
     <l n="244">With arms and laws . But , nothing careful now</l>
     <l n="245">Save for his injured country , here he stands</l>
     <l n="246">In deep solicitude with Cimon join 'd :</l>
     <l n="247">Unconscious both what widely different lots</l>
     <l n="248">Await them , taught by nature as they are</l>
     <l n="249">To know one common good , one common ill .</l>
     <l n="250">For Cimon , not his valour , not his birth 250</l>
     <l n="251">Derived from Codrus , not a thousand gifts</l>
     <l n="252">Dealt round him with a wise , benignant hand ;</l>
     <l n="253">No , not the Olympic olive , by himself</l>
     <l n="254">From his own brow transferr 'd to soothe the mind</l>
     <l n="255">Of this Pisistratus , can long preserve</l>
     <l n="256">From the fell envy of the tyrant 's sons ,</l>
     <l n="257">And their assassin dagger . But if death</l>
     <l n="258">Obscure upon his gentle steps attend ,</l>
     <l n="259">Yet fate an ample recompense prepares</l>
     <l n="260">In his victorious son , that other great 260</l>
     <l n="261">Miltiades , who o'er the very throne</l>
     <l n="262">Of Glory shall with Time 's assiduous hand</l>
     <l n="263">In adamantine characters engrave</l>
     <l n="264">The name of Athens ; and , by Freedom arm 'd</l>
     <l n="265">‘ Gainst the gigantic pride of Asia 's king ,</l>
     <l n="266">Shall all the achievements of the heroes old</l>
     <l n="267">Surmount , of Hercules , of all who sail 'd</l>
     <l n="268">From Thessaly with Jason , all who fought</l>

     <l n="270">Such were the patriots who within the porch 270</l>
     <l n="271">Of Solon had assembled . But the gate</l>
     <l n="272">Now opens , and across the ample floor</l>
     <l n="273">Straight they proceed into an open space</l>

     <l n="574">Of Tyne , and ye most ancient woodlands ; where ,</l>
     <l n="575">Oft as the giant flood obliquely strides ,</l>
     <l n="576">And his banks open , and his lawns extend ,</l>
     <l n="577">Stops short the pleased traveller to view</l>
     <l n="578">Presiding o'er the scene some rustic tower</l>
     <l n="579">Founded by Norman or by Saxon hands :</l>
     <l n="580">O ye Northumbrian shades , which overlook</l>
     <l n="581">The rocky pavement and the mossy falls</l>
     <l n="582">Of solitary Wensbeck 's limpid stream ; 40</l>
     <l n="583">How gladly I recall your well-known seats</l>
     <l n="584">Beloved of old , and that delightful time</l>
     <l n="585">When all alone , for many a summer 's day ,</l>
     <l n="586">I wander 'd through your calm recesses , led</l>

     <l n="596">In idle darkness , am alive to thoughts</l>
     <l n="597">Of honourable fame , of truth divine</l>
     <l n="598">Or moral , and of minds to virtue won</l>
     <l n="599">By the sweet magic of harmonious verse ;</l>

     <l n="601">On general habits , and on arts which grow</l>
     <l n="602">Spontaneous in the minds of all mankind , 60</l>
     <l n="603">Hath dwelt our argument ; and how , self-taught ,</l>
     <l n="604">Though seldom conscious of their own employ ,</l>
     <l n="605">In Nature 's or in Fortune 's changeful scene</l>
     <l n="606">Men learn to judge of Beauty , and acquire</l>
     <l n="607">Those forms set up , as idols in the soul</l>
     <l n="608">For love and zealous praise . Yet indistinct ,</l>
     <l n="609">In vulgar bosoms , and unnoticed lie</l>
     <l n="610">These pleasing stores , unless the casual force</l>
     <l n="611">Of things external prompt the heedless mind</l>
     <l n="612">To recognise her wealth . But some there are 70</l>
     <l n="613">Conscious of Nature , and the rule which man</l>
     <l n="614">O'er Nature holds ; some who , within themselves</l>
     <l n="615">Retiring from the trivial scenes of chance</l>
     <l n="616">And momentary passion , can at will</l>
     <l n="617">Call up these fair exemplars of the mind ;</l>
     <l n="618">Review their features ; scan the secret laws</l>
     <l n="619">Which bind them to each other : and display</l>
     <l n="620">By forms , or sounds , or colours , to the sense</l>
     <l n="621">Of all the world their latent charms display ;</l>
     <l n="622">Even as in Nature 's frame ( if such a word , 80</l>
     <l n="623">If such a word , so bold , may from the lips</l>
     <l n="624">Of man proceed ) as in this outward frame</l>
     <l n="625">Of things , the great Artificer portrays</l>
     <l n="626">His own immense idea . Various names</l>
     <l n="627">These among mortals bear , as various signs</l>
     <l n="628">They use , and by peculiar organs speak</l>
     <l n="629">To human sense . There are who , by the flight</l>
     <l n="630">Of air through tubes with moving stops distinct ,</l>
     <l n="631">Or by extended chords in measure taught</l>
     <l n="632">To vibrate , can assemble powerful sounds 90</l>
     <l n="633">Expressing every temper of the mind</l>
     <l n="634">From every cause , and charming all the soul</l>
     <l n="635">With passion void of care . Others mean time</l>
     <l n="636">The rugged mass of metal , wood , or stone ,</l>
     <l n="637">Patiently taming ; or with easier hand</l>
     <l n="638">Describing lines , and with more ample scope</l>
     <l n="639">Uniting colours ; can to general sight</l>
     <l n="640">Produce those permanent and perfect forms ,</l>
     <l n="641">Those characters of heroes and of gods ,</l>
     <l n="642">Which from the crude materials of the world , 100</l>
     <l n="643">Their own high minds created . But the chief</l>
     <l n="644">Are poets ; eloquent men , who dwell on earth</l>
     <l n="645">To clothe whate'er the soul admires or loves</l>
     <l n="646">With language and with numbers . Hence to these</l>
     <l n="647">A field is open 'd wide as Nature 's sphere ;</l>
     <l n="648">Nay , wider : various as the sudden acts</l>
     <l n="649">Of human wit , and vast as the demands</l>
     <l n="650">Of human will . The bard nor length , nor depth ,</l>
     <l n="651">Nor place , nor form controls . To eyes , to ears ,</l>
     <l n="652">To every organ of the copious mind , 110</l>
     <l n="653">He offereth all its treasures . Him the hours ,</l>
     <l n="654">The seasons him obey , and changeful Time</l>
     <l n="655">Sees him at will keep measure with his flight ,</l>
     <l n="656">At will outstrip it . To enhance his toil ,</l>
     <l n="657">He summoneth , from the uttermost extent</l>
     <l n="658">Of things which God hath taught him , every form</l>
     <l n="659">Auxiliar , every power ; and all beside</l>
     <l n="660">Excludes imperious . His prevailing hand</l>
     <l n="661">Gives , to corporeal essence , life and sense</l>
     <l n="662">And every stately function of the soul . 120</l>
     <l n="663">The soul itself to him obsequious lies ,</l>
     <l n="664">Like matter 's passive heap ; and as he wills ,</l>
     <l n="665">To reason and affection he assigns</l>
     <l n="666">Their just alliances , their just degrees :</l>
     <l n="667">Whence his peculiar honours ; whence the race</l>
     <l n="668">Of men who people his delightful world ,</l>
     <l n="669">Men genuine and according to themselves ,</l>
     <l n="670">Transcend as far the uncertain sons of earth ,</l>
     <l n="671">As earth itself to his delightful world ,</l>
     <l n="672">The palm of spotless Beauty doth resign . 130</l>

     <l n="1">1 The radiant ruler of the year</l>
     <l n="2">At length his wintry goal attains ;</l>
     <l n="3">Soon to reverse the long career ,</l>
     <l n="4">And northward bend his steady reins .</l>
     <l n="5">Now , piercing half Potosi 's height ,</l>
     <l n="6">Prone rush the fiery floods of light</l>
     <l n="7">Ripening the mountain 's silver stores :</l>
     <l n="8">While , in some cavern 's horrid shade ,</l>
     <l n="9">The panting Indian hides his head ,</l>
     <l n="10">And oft the approach of eve implores .</l>

     <l n="11">2 But lo , on this deserted coast ,</l>
     <l n="12">How pale the sun ! how thick the air !</l>
     <l n="13">Mustering his storms , a sordid host ,</l>
     <l n="14">Lo , Winter desolates the year .</l>
     <l n="15">The fields resign their latest bloom ;</l>
     <l n="16">No more the breezes waft perfume ,</l>

     <l n="20">Her griefs infect the human soul .</l>

     <l n="3">1 Thy verdant scenes , O Goulder 's Hill ,</l>

     <l n="6">Once more I climb thy steep aërial way .</l>
     <l n="7">O faithful cure of oft-returning ill ,</l>
     <l n="8">Now call thy sprightly breezes round ,</l>
     <l n="9">Dissolve this rigid cough profound ,</l>

    <head>NOTES .</head>
    <p n="1">BOOK FIRST .</p>
    <p n="2">ODE XVIII , STANZA II .— 2 .</p>
    <p n="3">Lycurgus the Lacedemonian lawgiver brought into Greece from Asia Minor the first complete copy of Homer 's works . At Plataea was fought the decisive battle between the Persian army and the united militia of Greece under Pausanias and Aristides . Cimon the Athenian erected a trophy in Cyprus for two great victories gained on the same day over the Persians by sea and land . Diodorus Siculus has preserved the inscription which the Athenians affixed to the consecrated spoils , after this great success ; in which it is very remarkable that the greatness of the occasion has raised the manner of expression above the usual simplicity and modesty of all other ancient inscriptions . It is this :—</p>
    <p n="4">[ Greek : EX . OU . G. EUROPAeN . ASIAS . DIChA . PONTOS . ENEIME . KAI . POLEAS . ONAeTON . ThOUROS . ARAeS . EPEChEI . OUDEN . PO . TOIOUTON . EPIChThONION . GENET . ANDRON . ERGON .

    <p n="5">The following translation is almost literal :—</p>
    <p n="6">Since first the sea from Asia 's hostile coast Divided Europe , and the god of war Assail 'd imperious cities ; never yet , At once among the waves and on the shore , Hath such a labour been achieved by men Who earth inhabit . They , whose arms the Medes In Cyprus felt pernicious , they , the same , Have won from skilful Tyre an hundred ships Crowded with warriors . Asia groans , in both Her hands sore smitten , by the might of war .</p>
    <p n="7">STANZA II .— 3 .</p>
    <p n="8">Pindar was contemporary with Aristides and Cimon , in whom the glory of ancient Greece was at its height . When Xerxes invaded Greece , Pindar was true to the common interest of his country ; though his fellow-citizens , the Thebans , had sold themselves to the Persian king . In one of his odes he expresses the great distress and anxiety of his mind , occasioned by the vast preparations of Xerxes against Greece ( Isthm . 8 ) . In another he celebrates the victories of Salamis , Plataea , and Himera ( Pyth . 1 ) . It will be necessary to add two or three other particulars of his life , real or fabulous , in order to explain what follows in the text concerning him . First , then , he was thought to be so great a favourite of Apollo , that the priests of that deity allotted him a constant share of their offerings . It was said of him , as of some other illustrious men , that at his birth a swarm of bees lighted on his lips , and fed him with their honey . It was also a tradition concerning him , that Pan was heard to recite his poetry , and seen dancing to one of his hymns on the mountains near Thebes . But a real historical fact in his life is , that the Thebans imposed a large fine upon him on account of the veneration which he expressed in his poems for that heroic spirit shown by the people of Athens in defence of the common liberty , which his own fellow-citizens had shamefully betrayed . And as the argument of this ode implies , that great poetical talents and high sentiments of liberty do reciprocally produce and assist each other , so Pindar is perhaps the most exemplary proof of this connexion which occurs in history . The Thebans were remarkable , in general , for a slavish disposition through all the fortunes of their commonwealth ; at the time of its ruin by Philip ; and even in its best state , under the administration of Pelopidas and Epaminondas : and every one knows they were no less remarkable for great dulness and want of all genius . That Pindar should have equally distinguished himself from the rest of his fellow-citizens in both these respects seems somewhat extraordinary , and is scarce to be accounted for but by the preceding observation .</p>

    <p n="17">Mr. Locke died in 1704 , when Mr. Hoadly was beginning to distinguish himself in the cause of civil and religious liberty : Lord Godolphin in 1712 , when the doctrines of the Jacobite faction were chiefly favoured by those in power : Lord Somers in 1716 , amid the practices of the nonjoining clergy against the Protestant establishment ; and Lord Stanhope in 1721 , during the controversy with the lower house of convocation .</p>

    <p n="19">During Mr. Pope 's war with Theobald , Concanen , and the rest of their tribe , Mr. Warburton , the present Lord Bishop of Gloucester , did with great zeal cultivate their friendship , having been introduced , forsooth , at the meetings of that respectable confederacy — a favour which he afterwards spoke of in very high terms of complacency and thankfulness . At the same time , in his intercourse with them , he treated Mr. Pope in a most contemptuous manner , and as a writer without genius . Of the truth of these assertions his lordship can have no doubt , if he recollects his own correspondence with Concanen , a part of which is still in being , and will probably be remembered as long as any of this prelate 's writings .</p>

    <p n="21">In the year 1751 appeared a very splendid edition , in quarto , of ‘ Mémoires pour servir à l'Histoire de la Maison de Brandebourg , à Berlin et à la Haye , ’ with a privilege , signed Frederic , the same being engraved in imitation of handwriting . In this edition , among other extraordinary passages , are the two following , to which the third stanza of this ode more particularly refers :—</p>
    <p n="22">‘ Il se fit une migration ’ ( the author is speaking of what happened at the revocation of the Edict of Nantes ) , ‘ dont on n'avoit guère vu d'exemples dans l'histoire : un peuple entier sortit du royaume par l'esprit de parti en haine du pape , et pour reçevoir sous un autre ciel la communion sous les deux espèces : quatre cens mille âmes s'expatrierent ainsi et abandonnerent tous leur biens pour détonner dans d'autres temples les vieux pseaumes de Clément Marot . ’ — Page 163 .</p>
    <p n="23">‘ La crainte donna le jour à la crédulité , et l'amour propre interessa bientôt le ciel au destin des hommes . ’ — Page 242 .</p>
    <p n="24">HYMN TO THE NAIADS . 1746 .</p>
    <p n="25">ARGUMENT .</p>
    <p n="26">The Nymphs , who preside over springs and rivulets , are addressed at daybreak , in honour of their several functions , and of the relations which they bear to the natural and to the moral world . Their origin is deduced from the first allegorical deities , or powers of nature , according to the doctrine of the old mythological poets , concerning the generation of the gods and the rise of things . They are then successively considered , as giving motion to the air and exciting summer breezes ; as nourishing and beautifying the vegetable creation ; as contributing to the fulness of navigable rivers , and consequently to the maintenance of commerce ; and by that means to the maritime part of military power . Next is represented their favourable influence upon health when assisted by rural exercise , which introduces their connexion with the art of physic , and the happy effects of mineral medicinal springs . Lastly , they are celebrated for the friendship which the Muses bear them , and for the true inspiration which temperance only can receive , in opposition to the enthusiasm of the more licentious poets .</p>
    <p n="27">O'er yonder eastern bill the twilight pale Walks forth from darkness ; and the God of day , With bright Astraea seated by his side , Waits yet to leave the ocean . Tarry , Nymphs , Ye Nymphs , ye blue-eyed progeny of Thames , Who now the mazes of this rugged heath Trace with your fleeting steps ; who all night long Repeat , amid the cool and tranquil air , Your lonely murmurs , tarry , and receive My offer 'd lay . To pay you homage due , 10 I leave the gates of sleep ; nor shall my lyre Too far into the splendid hours of morn Engage your audience ; my observant hand Shall close the strain ere any sultry beam Approach you . To your subterranean haunts Ye then may timely steal ; to pace with care The humid sands ; to loosen from the soil The bubbling sources ; to direct the rills To meet in wider channels ; or beneath Some grotto 's dripping arch , at height of noon 20 To slumber , shelter 'd from the burning heaven .</p>
    <p n="28">Where shall my song begin , ye Nymphs , or end ? Wide is your praise and copious — first of things , First of the lonely powers , ere Time arose , Were Love and Chaos . Love , [ A ] the sire of Fate ; [ B ] Elder than Chaos . [ C ] Born of Fate was Time , [ D ] Who many sons and many comely births Devour 'd , [ E ] relentless father ; till the child Of Rhea [ F ] drove him from the upper sky , [ G ] And quell 'd his deadly might . Then social reign 'd 30 The kindred powers , [ H ] Tethys , and reverend Ops , And spotless Vesta ; while supreme of sway Remain 'd the Cloud-Compeller . From the couch Of Tethys sprang the sedgy-crowned race , [ I ] Who from a thousand urns , o'er every clime , Send tribute to their parent ; and from them Are ye , O Naiads : [ J ] Arethusa fair , And tuneful Aganippe ; that sweet name , Bandusia ; that soft family which dwelt With Syrian Daphne ; [ K ] and the honour 'd tribes 40 Beloved of Pæon . [ L ] Listen to my strain , Daughters of Tethys : listen to your praise .</p>
    <p n="29">You , Nymphs , the winged offspring , [ M ] which of old Aurora to divine Astræus bore , Owns , and your aid beseecheth . When the might Of Hyperíon , [ N ] from his noontide throne , Unbends their languid pinions , aid from you They ask ; Pavonius and the mild South-west Prom you relief implore . Your sallying streams [ O ] Fresh vigour to their weary wings impart . 50 Again they fly , disporting ; from the mead Half-ripen 'd and the tender blades of corn , To sweep the noxious mildew ; or dispel Contagious steams , which oft the parched earth Breathes on her fainting sons . From noon to eve . Along the river and the pavèd brook , Ascend the cheerful breezes : hail 'd of bards Who , fast by learned Cam , the Æolian lyre Solicit ; nor unwelcome to the youth Who on the heights of Tibur , all inclined 60 O'er rushing Arno , with a pious hand The reverend scene delineates , broken fanes , Or tombs , or pillar 'd aqueducts , the pomp Of ancient Time ; and haply , while he scans The ruins , with a silent tear revolves The fame and fortune of imperious Rome .</p>
    <p n="30">You too , O Nymphs , and your unenvious aid The rural powers confess , and still prepare For you their choicest treasures . Pan commands , Oft as the Delian king [ P ] with Sirius holds 70 The central heavens , the father of the grove Commands his Dryads over your abodes To spread their deepest umbrage . Well the god Remembereth how indulgent ye supplied Your genial dews to nurse them in their prime .</p>
    <p n="31">Pales , the pasture 's queen , where'er ye stray , Pursues your steps , delighted ; and the path With living verdure clothes . Around your haunts The laughing Chloris , [ Q ] with profusest hand , Throws wide her blooms , her odours . Still with you 80 Pomona seeks to dwell ; and o'er the lawns , And o'er the vale of Richmond , where with Thames Ye love to wander , Amalthea [ R ] pours , Well-pleased , the wealth of that Ammonian horn , Her dower ; unmindful of the fragrant isles Nysæan or Atlantic . Nor canst thou ( Albeit oft , ungrateful , thou dost mock The beverage of the sober Naiad 's urn , O Bromius , O Lenæan ) , nor canst thou Disown the powers whose bounty , ill repaid , 90 With nectar feeds thy tendrils . Yet from me , Yet , blameless Nymphs , from my delighted lyre , Accept the rites your bounty well may claim , Nor heed the scoffings of the Edonian band . [ S ]</p>
    <p n="32">For better praise awaits you . Thames , your sire , As down the verdant slope your duteous rills Descend , the tribute stately Thames receives , Delighted ; and your piety applauds ; And bids his copious tide roll on secure , For faithful are his daughters ; and with words 100 Auspicious gratulates the bark which , now His banks forsaking , her adventurous wings Yields to the breeze , with Albion 's happy gifts Extremest isles to bless . And oft at morn , When Hermes , [ T ] from Olympus bent o'er earth To bear the words of Jove , on yonder hill Stoops lightly sailing ; oft intent your springs He views : and waving o'er some new-born stream His bless 'd pacific wand , ‘ And yet , ’ he cries , ‘ Yet , ’ cries the son of Maia , ‘ though recluse 110 And silent be your stores , from you , fair Nymphs , Flows wealth and kind society to men . By you my function and my honour 'd name Do I possess ; while o'er the Boetic rale , Or through the towers of Memphis , or the palms By sacred Ganges water 'd , I conduct The English merchant ; with the buxom fleece Of fertile Ariconium while I clothe Sarmatian kings ; or to the household gods Of Syria , from the bleak Cornubian shore , 120 Dispense the mineral treasure [ U ] which of old Sidonian pilots sought , when this fair land Was yet unconscious of those generous arts , Which wise Phoenicia from their native clime Transplanted to a more indulgent heaven . ’</p>
    <p n="33">Such are the words of Hermes : such the praise , O Naiads , which from tongues celestial waits Your bounteous deeds . From bounty issueth power : And those who , sedulous in prudent works , Relieve the wants of nature , Jove repays 130 With noble wealth , and his own seat on earth , Pit judgments to pronounce , and curb the might Of wicked men . Your kind unfailing urns Not vainly to the hospitable arts Of Hermes yield their store . For , O ye Nymphs , Hath he not won [ V ] the unconquerable queen Of arms to court your friendship You she owns The fair associates who extend her sway Wide o'er the mighty deep ; and grateful things Of you she littereth , oft as from the shore 140 Of Thames , or Medway 's vale , or the green banks Of Vecta , she her thundering navy leads To Calpe 's [ W ] foaming channel , or the rough Cantabrian surge ; her auspices divine Imparting to the senate and the prince Of Albion , to dismay barbaric kings , The Iberian , or the Celt . The pride of kings Was ever scorn 'd by Pallas ; and of old Rejoiced the virgin , from the brazen prow Of Athens o'er Ægina 's gloomy surge , [ X ] 150 To drive her clouds and storms ; o'erwhelming all The Persian 's promised glory , when the realms Of Indus and the soft Ionian clime , When Libya 's torrid champaign and the rocks Of cold Imaüs join 'd their servile bands , To sweep the sons of Liberty from earth . In vain ; Minerva on the bounding prow Of Athens stood , and with the thunder 's voice Denounced her terrors on their impious heads , And shook her burning ægis . Xerxes saw ; [ Y ] 160 From Heracléum , on the mountain 's height Throned in his golden car , he knew the sign Celestial ; felt unrighteous hope forsake His faltering heart , and turn 'd his face with shame .</p>
    <p n="34">Hail , ye who share the stern Minerva 's power ; Who arm the hand of Liberty for war , And give to the renown 'd Britannic name To awe contending monarchs : yet benign , Yet mild of nature , to the works of peace More prone , and lenient of the many ills 170 Which wait on human life . Your gentle aid Hygeia well can witness ; she who saves , From poisonous dates and cups of pleasing bane , The wretch , devoted to the entangling snares Of Bacchus and of Comus . Him she leads To Cynthia 's lonely haunts . To spread the toils , To beat the coverts , with the jovial horn At dawn of day to summon the loud hounds , She calls the lingering sluggard from his dreams , And where his breast may drink the mountain breeze , 180 And where the fervour of the sunny vale May beat upon his brow , through devious paths Beckons his rapid courser . Nor when ease , Cool ease and welcome slumbers have becalm 'd His eager bosom , does the queen of health Her pleasing care withhold . His decent board She guards , presiding , and the frugal powers With joy sedate leads in ; and while the brown Ennæan dame with Pan presents her stores , While changing still , and comely in the change , 190 Vertumnus and the Hours before him spread The garden 's banquet , you to crown his feast , To crown his feast , O Naiads , you the fair Hygeia calls ; and from your shelving seats , And groves of poplar , plenteous cups ye bring , To slake his veins , till soon a purer tide Flows down those loaded channels , washeth off The dregs of luxury , the lurking seeds Of crude disease , and through the abodes of life Sends vigour , sends repose . Hail , Naiads , hail ! 200 Who give to labour , health ; to stooping age , The joys which youth had squander 'd . Oft your urns Will I invoke ; and frequent in your praise , Abash the frantic thyrsus [ Z ] with my song .</p>
    <p n="35">For not estranged from your benignant arts Is he , the god , to whose mysterious shrine My youth was sacred , and my votive cares Belong , the learned Pæon . Oft when all His cordial treasures he hath search 'd in vain ; When herbs , and potent trees , and drops of balm 210 Rich with the genial influence of the sun ( To rouse dark fancy from her plaintive dreams , To brace the nerveless arm , with food to win Sick appetite , or hush the unquiet breast Which pines with silent passion ) , he in vain Hath proved ; to your deep mansions he descends . Your gates of humid rock , your dim arcades , He entereth ; where empurpled veins of ore Gleam on the roof ; where through the rigid mine Your trickling rills insinuate . There the god 220 From your indulgent hands the streaming bowl Wafts to his pale-eyed suppliants ; wafts the seeds Metallic and the elemental salts Wash 'd from the pregnant glebe . They drink , and soon Flies pain ; flies inauspicious care ; and soon The social haunt or unfrequented shade Hears Io , Io Pæan , [ AA ] as of old , When Python fell . And , O propitious Nymphs , Oft as for hapless mortals I implore Your sultry springs , through every urn , 230 Oh , shed your healing treasures ! With the first And finest breath , which from the genial strife Of mineral fermentation springs , like light O'er the fresh morning 's vapours , lustrate then The fountain , and inform the rising wave .</p>
    <p n="36">My lyre shall pay your bounty . Scorn not ye That humble tribute . Though a mortal hand Excite the strings to utterance , yet for themes Not unregarded of celestial powers , I frame their language ; and the Muses deign 240 To guide the pious tenor of my lay . The Muses ( sacred by their gifts divine ) In early days did to my wondering sense Their secrets oft reveal ; oft my raised ear In slumber felt their music ; oft at noon , Or hour of sunset , by some lonely stream , In field or shady grove , they taught me words Of power from death and envy to preserve The good man 's name . Whence yet with grateful mind , And offerings unprofaned by ruder eye , 250 My vows I send , my homage , to the seats Of rocky Cirrha , [ BB ] where with you they dwell , Where you their chaste companions they admit , Through all the hallow 'd scene ; where oft intent , And leaning o'er Castalia 's mossy verge , They mark the cadence of your confluent urns , How tuneful , yielding gratefullest repose To their consorted measure , till again , With emulation all the sounding choir , And bright Apollo , leader of the song , 260 Their voices through the liquid air exalt , And sweep their lofty strings ; those powerful strings That charm the mind of gods , [ CC ] that fill the courts Of wide Olympus with oblivion sweet Of evils , with immortal rest from cares , Assuage the terrors of the throne of Jove , And quench the formidable thunderbolt Of unrelenting fire . With slacken 'd wings , While now the solemn concert breathes around , Incumbent o'er the sceptre of his lord 270 Sleeps the stern eagle , by the number 'd notes , Possess 'd , and satiate with the melting tone , Sovereign of birds . The furious god of war , His darts forgetting , and the winged wheels That bear him vengeful o'er the embattled plain , Relents , and soothes his own fierce heart to ease , Most welcome ease . The sire of gods and men In that great moment of divine delight , Looks down on all that live ; and whatsoe'er He loves not , o'er the peopled earth and o'er 280 The interminated ocean , he beholds Cursed with abhorrence by his doom severe , And troubled at the sound . Ye , Naiads , ye With ravish 'd ears the melody attend Worthy of sacred silence . But the slaves Of Bacchus with tempestuous clamours strive To drown the heavenly strains , of highest Jove Irreverent , and by mad presumption fired Their own discordant raptures to advance With hostile emulation . Down they rush 290 From Nysa 's vine-empurpled cliff , the dames Of Thrace , the Satyrs , and the unruly Fauns , With old Silenus , reeling through the crowd Which gambols round him , in convulsions wild Tossing their limbs , and brandishing in air The ivy-mantled thyrsus , or the torch Through black smoke flaming , to the Phrygian pipe 's [ DD ] Shrill voice , and to the clashing cymbals , mix 'd With shrieks and frantic uproar . May the gods From every unpolluted ear avert 300 Their orgies ! If within the seats of men , Within the walls , the gates , where Pallas holds [ EE ] The guardian key , if haply there be found Who loves to mingle with the revel-band And hearken to their accents , who aspires From such instructors to inform his breast With verse , let him , fit votarist , implore Their inspiration . He perchance the gifts Of young Lyæus , and the dread exploits , May sing in aptest numbers ; he the fate 310 Of sober Pentheus , [ FF ] he the Paphian rites , And naked Mars with Cytherea chain 'd , And strong Alcides in the spinster 's robes , May celebrate , applauded . But with you , O Naiads , far from that unhallow 'd rout , Must dwell the man whoe'er to praisèd themes Invokes the immortal Muse . The immortal Muse To your calm habitations , to the cave Corycian [ GG ] or the Delphic mount , [ HH ] will guide His footsteps , and with your unsullied streams 320 His lips will bathe ; whether the eternal lore Of Themis , or the majesty of Jove , To mortals he reveal ; or teach his lyre The unenvied guerdon of the patriot 's toils , In those unfading islands of the bless 'd , Where sacred bards abide . Hail , honour 'd Nymphs ; Thrice hail ! For you the Cyrenaïc shell , [ II ] Behold , I touch , revering . To my songs Be present ye with favourable feet , And all profaner audience far remove . 330</p>

<note>Footnote A : ‘ Love ,.... Elder than Chaos . ’ — L. 25 . Hesiod in his Theogony gives a different account , and makes Chaos the eldest of beings , though he assigns to Love neither father nor superior ; which circumstance is particularly mentioned by Phædrus , in Plato 's Banquet , as being observable not only in Hesiod , but in all other writers both of verse and prose ; and on the same occasion he cites a line from Parmenides , in which Love is expressly styled the eldest of all the gods . Yet Aristophanes , in ‘ The Birds , ’ affirms , that ‘ Chaos , and Night , and Erebus , and Tartarus were first ; and that Love was produced from an egg , which the sable-winged Night deposited in the immense bosom of Erebus . ’ But it must be observed , that the Love designed by this comic poet was always distinguished from the other , from that original and self-existent being the TO ON [ Greek ] or AGAThON [ Greek ] of Plato , and meant only the DAeMIOURGOS [ Greek ] or second person of the old Grecian Trinity ; to whom is inscribed a hymn among those which pass under the name of Orpheus , where he is called Protogonos , or the first-begotten , is said to have been born of an egg , and is represented as the principal or origin of all these external appearances of nature . In the fragments of Orpheus , collected by Henry Stephens , he is named Phanes , the discoverer or discloser , who unfolded the ideas of the supreme intelligence , and exposed them to the perception of inferior beings in this visible frame of the world ; as Macrobius , and Proclus , and Athenagoras , all agree to interpret the several passages of Orpheus which they have preserved .</note>    <note xml:id="noteA" place="bottom" n="A">‘ Love ,....

    <p n="38">But the Love designed in our text is the one self-existent and infinite mind ; whom if the generality of ancient mythologists have not introduced or truly described in accounting for the production of the world and its appearances , yet , to a modern poet , it can be no objection that he hath ventured to differ from them in this particular , though in other respects he professeth to imitate their manner and conform to their opinions ; for , in these great points of natural theology , they differ no less remarkably among themselves , and are perpetually confounding the philosophical relations of things with the traditionary circumstances of mythic history ; upon which very account Callimachus , in his hymn to Jupiter , declareth his dissent from them concerning even an article of the national creed , adding , that the ancient bards were by no means to be depended on . And yet in the exordium of the old Argonautic poem , ascribed to Orpheus , it is said , that ‘ Love , whom mortals in later times call Phanes , was the father of the eternally-begotten Night ; ’ who is generally represented by these mythological poets as being herself the parent of all things ; and who , in the ‘ Indigitamenta , ’ or Orphic Hymns , is said to be the same with Cypris , or Love itself . Moreover , in the body of this Argonautic poem , where the personated Orpheus introduceth himself singing to his lyre in reply to Chiron , he celebrateth ‘ the obscure memory of Chaos , and the natures which it contained within itself in a state of perpetual vicissitude ; how the heaven had its boundary determined , the generation of the earth , the depth of the ocean , and also the sapient Love , the most ancient , the self-sufficient , with all the beings which he produced when he separated one thing from another . ’ Which noble passage is more directly to Aristotle 's purpose in the first book of his metaphysics than any of those which he has there quoted , to show that the ancient poets and mythologists agreed with Empedocles , Anaxagoras , and the other more sober philosophers , in that natural anticipation and common notion of mankind concerning the necessity of mind and reason to account for the connexion , motion , and good order of the world . For though neither this poem , nor the hymns which pass under the same name , are , it should seem , the work of the real Orpheus , yet beyond all question they are very ancient . The hymns , more particularly , are allowed to be older than the invasion of Greece by Xerxes , and were probably a set of public and solemn forms of devotion , as appears by a passage in one of them which Demosthenes hath almost literally cited in his first oration against Aristogiton , as the saying of Orpheus , the founder of their most holy mysteries . On this account , they are of higher authority than any other mythological work now extant , the Theogony of Hesiod himself not excepted . The poetry of them is often extremely noble ; and the mysterious air which prevails in them , together with its delightful impression upon the mind , cannot be better expressed than in that remarkable description with which they inspired the German editor , Eschenbach , when he accidentally met with them at Leipsic : — ‘ Thesaurum me reperisse credidi , ’ says he , ‘ et profecto thesaurum reperi . Incredibile dictu quo me sacro horrore afflaverint indigitamenta ista deorum : nam et tempus ad illorum lectionem eligere cogebar , quod vel solum horrorem incutere animo potest , nocturnum ; cum enim totam diem consumserim in contemplando urbis splendore , et in adeundis , quibus scatet urbs illa , viris doctis ; sola nox restabat , quam Orpheo consecrare potui . In abyesum quendam mysteriorum venerandæ antiquitatis descendere videbar , quotiescunque silente mundo , solis vigilantibus astris et luna , [ Greek : melanaephutous ] istos hymnos ad manus sumsi . ’ ]</p>
<note>Footnote B : ‘ Love , the sire of Fate . ’ — L. 25 . Fate is the universal system of natural causes ; the work of the Omnipotent Mind , or of Love : so Minucius Felix :— ‘ Quid enim aliud est fatum , quam quod de unoquoque nostrum deus fatus est . ’ So also Cicero , in the First Book on Divination :— ‘ Fatum autem id appello , quod Graeci EIMAPMENIIN : id est , ordinem seriemque causarum , cum causa causæ nexa rem ex se gignat — ex quo intelligitur , ut fatum sit non id quod superstitiose , sed id quod physice dicitur causa asterna rerum . ’ To the same purpose is the doctrine of Hierocles , in that excellent fragment concerning Providence and Destiny . As to the three Fates , or Destinies of the poets , they represented that part of the general system of natural causes which relates to man , and to other mortal beings : for so we are told in the hymn addressed to them among the Orphic Indigitamenta , where they are called the daughters of Night ( or Love ) , and , contrary to the vulgar notion , are distinguished by the epithets of gentle and tender-hearted . According to Hesiod , Theog . ver . 904 , they were the daughters of Jupiter and Themis : but in the Orphic hymn to Venus , or Love , that goddess is directly styled the mother of Necessity , and is represented , immediately after , as governing the three Destinies , and conducting the whole system of natural causes .</note>    <note xml:id="noteB" place="bottom" n="B">‘ Love , the sire of Fate . ’ — L. 25 .

    <p n="44">The descent of the Naiads is less certain than most points of the Greek mythology . Homer , Odyss . xiii . [ Greek : kourai Dios ] . Virgil , in the eighth book of the Æneid , speaks as if the Nymphs , or Naiads , were the parents of the rivers : but in this he contradicts the testimony of Hesiod , and evidently departs from the orthodox system , which represented several nymphs as retaining to every single river . On the other hand , Callimachus , who was very learned in all the school-divinity of those times , in his hymn to Delos , maketh Peneus , the great Thessalian river-god , the father of his nymphs : and Ovid , in the fourteenth book of his Metamorphoses , mentions the Naiads of Latium as the immediate daughters of the neighbouring river-gods . Accordingly , the Naiads of particular rivers are occasionally , both by Ovid and Statius , called by patronymic , from the name of the river to which they belong .</p>

Thymoetes had travelled over Libya to the country which borders on the western ocean ; there he saw the island of Nysa , and learned from the inhabitants , that ‘ Ammon , King of Libya , was married in former ages to Rhea , sister of Saturn and the Titans : that he afterwards fell in love with a beautiful virgin whose name was Amalthea ; had by her a son , and gave her possession of a neighbouring tract of land , wonderfully fertile ; which in shape nearly resembling the horn of an ox , was thence called the Hesperian horn , and afterwards the horn of Amalthea : that fearing the jealousy of Rhea , he concealed the young Bacchus in the island of Nysa ; ’ the beauty of which , Diodorus describes with great dignity and pomp of style . This fable is one of the noblest in all the ancient mythology , and seems to have made a particular impression on the imagination of Milton ; the only modern poet ( unless perhaps it be necessary to except Spenser ) who , in these mysterious traditions of the poetic story , had a heart to feel , and words to express , the simple and solitary genius of antiquity .

One may walk a great way into it without a torch . ‘ Tis of a considerable height , and hath several springs within it ; and yet a much greater quantity of water distils from the shell and roof , so as to be continually dropping on the ground .

On this account he was induced to attempt somewhat in the same manner ; solely by way of exercise : the manner itself being now almost entirely abandoned in poetry . And as the mere genealogy , or the personal adventures of heathen gods , could have been but little interesting to a modern reader , it was therefore thought proper to select some convenient part of the history of nature , and to employ these ancient divinities as it is probable they were first employed ; to wit , in personifying natural causes , and in representing the mutual agreement or opposition of the corporeal and moral powers of the world : which hath been accounted the very highest office of poetry .</p>

    <p n="124">FOR A GROTTO .</p>
    <p n="125">To me , whom in their lays the shepherds call Actæa , daughter of the neighbouring stream , This cave belongs . The fig-tree and the vine , Which o'er the rocky entrance downward shoot , Were placed by Glycou . He with cowslips pale , Primrose , and purple lychnis , deck 'd the green Before my threshold , and my shelving walls With honeysuckle cover 'd . Here at noon , Lull 'd by the murmur of my rising fount , I slumber ; here my clustering fruits I tend ; Or from the humid flowers , at break of day , Fresh garlands weave , and chase from all my bounds Each thing impure or noxious . Enter in , O stranger , undismay 'd . Nor bat , nor toad Here lurks ; and if thy breast of blameless thoughts Approve thee , not unwelcome shalt thou tread My quiet mansion ; chiefly , if thy name Wise Pallas and the immortal Muses own .</p>

    <p n="127">FOR A STATUE OF CHAUCER AT WOODSTOCK .</p>
    <p n="128">Such was old Chaucer ; such the placid mien Of him who first with harmony inform 'd The language of our fathers . Here he dwelt For many a cheerful day . These ancient walls Have often heard him , while his legends blithe He sang ; of love , or knighthood , or the wiles Of homely life ; through each estate and age , The fashions and the follies of the world With cunning hand portraying . Though perchance From Blenheim 's towers , O stranger , thou art come Glowing with Churchill 's trophies ; yet in vain Dost thou applaud them if thy breast be cold To him , this other hero ; who , in times Dark and untaught , began with charming verse To tame the rudeness of his native land .</p>
    <p n="129">III .</p>
    <p n="130">Whoe'er thou art whose path in summer lies Through yonder village , turn thee where the grove Of branching oaks a rural palace old Embosoms . There dwells Albert , generous lord Of all the harvest round . And onward thence A low plain chapel fronts the morning light Fast by a silent rivulet . Humbly walk , O stranger , o'er the consecrated ground ; And on that verdant hillock , which thou seest Beset with osiers , let thy pious hand Sprinkle fresh water from the brook , and strew Sweet-smelling flowers . For there doth Edmund rest , The learned shepherd ; for each rural art Famed , and for songs harmonious , and the woes Of ill-requited love . The faithless pride Of fair Matilda sank him to the grave In manhood 's prime . But soon did righteous Heaven , With tears , with sharp remorse , and pining care , Avenge her falsehood . Nor could all the gold And nuptial pomp , which lured her plighted faith From Edmund to a loftier husband 's home , Relieve her breaking heart , or turn aside The strokes of death . Go , traveller ; relate The mournful story . Haply some fair maid May hold it in remembrance , and be taught That riches cannot pay for truth or love .</p>

Know ye not The features ’ ? Hath not oft his faithful tongue Told you the fashion of your own estate , The secrets of your bosom ? Here then , round His monument with reverence while ye stand , Say to each other : -  ‘ This was Shakspeare 's form ; Who walk 'd in every path of human life , Felt every passion ; and to all mankind Doth now , will ever , that experience yield Which his own genius only could acquire . ’</p>

    <p n="137">Thou , who the verdant plain dost traverse here , While Thames among his willows from thy view Retires ; O stranger , stay thee , and the scene Around contemplate well . This is the place Where England 's ancient barons , clad in arms And stern with conquest , from their tyrant king ( Then render 'd tame ) did challenge and secure The charter of thy freedom . Pass not on Till thou hast bless 'd their memory , and paid Those thanks which God appointed the reward Of public virtue . And if chance thy home Salute thee with a father 's honour 'd name , Go , call thy sons ; instruct them what a debt They owe their ancestors ; and make them swear To pay it , by transmitting down entire Those sacred rights to which themselves were born .</p>

    <p n="139">THE WOOD NYMPH .</p>
    <p n="140">Approach in silence . ‘ Tis no vulgar tale Which I , the Dryad of this hoary oak , Pronounce to mortal ears . The second age Now hasteneth to its period , since I rose On this fair lawn . The groves of yonder vale Are all my offspring : and each Nymph who guards The copses and the furrow 'd fields beyond , Obeys me . Many changes have I seen In human things , and many awful deeds Of justice , when the ruling hand of Jove Against the tyrants of the land , against The unhallow 'd sons of luxury and guile , Was arm 'd for retribution . Thus at length Expert in laws divine , I know the paths Of wisdom , and erroneous folly 's end Have oft presaged ; and now well-pleased I wait Each evening till a noble youth , who loves My shade , a while released from public cares , Yon peaceful gate shall enter , and sit down Beneath my branches . Then his musing mind I prompt , unseen ; and place before his view Sincerest forms of good ; and move his heart With the dread bounties of the Sire Supreme Of gods and men , with freedom 's generous deeds , The lofty voice of glory and the faith Of sacred friendship . Stranger , I have told My function . If within thy bosom dwell Aught which may challenge praise , thou wilt not leave Unhonour 'd my abode , nor shall I hear A sparing benediction from thy tongue .</p>
    <p n="141">VIII .</p>
    <p n="142">Ye powers unseen , to whom , the bards of Greece Erected altars ; ye who to the mind More lofty views unfold , and prompt the heart With more divine emotions ; if erewhile Not quite uupleasing have my votive rites Of you been deem 'd , when oft this lonely seat To you I consecrated ; then vouchsafe Here with your instant energy to crown My happy solitude . It is the hour When most I love to invoke you , and have felt Most frequent your glad ministry divine . The air is calm : the sun 's unveiled orb Shines in the middle heaven . The harvest round Stands quiet , and among the golden sheaves The reapers lie reclined . The neighbouring groves Are mute , nor even a linnet 's random strain Echoeth amid the silence . Let me feel Your influence , ye kind powers . Aloft in heaven , Abide ye ? or on those transparent clouds Pass ye from hill to hill ? or on the shades Which yonder elms cast o'er the lake below Do you converse retired ? From what loved haunt Shall I expect you ? Let me once more feel Your influence , O ye kind inspiring powers : And I will guard it well ; nor shall a thought Rise in my mind , nor shall a passion move Across my bosom unobserved , unstored By faithful memory . And then at some More active moment , will I call them forth Anew ; and join them in majestic forms , And give them utterance in harmonious strains ; That all mankind shall wonder at your sway .</p>
    <p n="143">IX .</p>
    <p n="144">Me though in life 's sequester 'd vale The Almighty Sire ordain 'd to dwell , Remote from glory 's toilsome ways , And the great scenes of public praise ; Yet let me still with grateful pride Remember how my infant frame He temper 'd with prophetic flame , And early music to my tongue supplied . ‘ Twas then my future fate he weigh 'd , And , this be thy concern , he said , At once with Passion 's keen alarms , And Beauty 's pleasurable charms , And sacred Truth 's eternal light , To move the various mind of Man ; Till , under one unblemish 'd plan , His Reason , Fancy , and his Heart unite .</p>
    <p n="145">AN EPISTLE TO CURIO .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></p>
    <p n="146">Thrice has the spring beheld thy faded fame , And the fourth winter rises on thy shame , Since I exulting grasp 'd the votive shell , In sounds of triumph all thy praise to tell ; Bless 'd could my skill through ages make thee shine , And proud to mix my memory with thine . But now the cause that waked my song before , With praise , with triumph , crowns the toil no more . If to the glorious man whose faithful cares , Nor quell 'd by malice , nor relax 'd by years , 10 Had awed Ambition 's wild audacious hate , And dragg 'd at length Corruption to her fate ; If every tongue its large applauses owed , And well-earn 'd laurels every Muse bestow 'd ; If public Justice urged the high reward , And Freedom smiled on the devoted bard ; Say then , to him whose levity or lust Laid all a people 's generous hopes in dust ; Who taught Ambition firmer heights of power , And saved Corruption at her hopeless hour ; 20 Does not each tongue its execrations owe ? Shall not each Muse a wreath of shame bestow , And public Justice sanctify th ’ award , And Freedom 's hand protect the impartial bard ?</p>
    <p n="147">Yet long reluctant I forbore thy name , Long watch 'd thy virtue like a dying flame , Hung o'er each glimmering spark with anxious eyes , And wish 'd and hoped the light again would rise . But since thy guilt still more entire appears , Since no art hides , no supposition clears ; 30 Since vengeful Slander now too sinks her blast , And the first rage of party-hate is past ; Calm as the judge of truth , at length I come To weigh thy merits , and pronounce thy doom : So may my trust from all reproach be free ; And Earth and Time confirm the fair decree .</p>
    <p n="148">There are who say they view 'd without amaze The sad reverse of all thy former praise : That through the pageants of a patriot 's name , They pierced the foulness of thy secret aim ; 40 Or deem 'd thy arm exalted but to throw The public thunder on a private foe . But I , whose soul consented to thy cause , Who felt thy genius stamp its own applause , Who saw the spirits of each glorious age Move in thy bosom , and direct thy rage ; I scorn 'd the ungenerous gloss of slavish minds , The owl-eyed race , whom Virtue 's lustre blinds . Spite of the learned in the ways of vice , And all who prove that each man has his price , 50 I still believed thy end was just and free ; And yet , even yet , believe it — spite of thee . Even though thy mouth impure has dared disclaim , Urged by the wretched impotence of shame , Whatever filial cares thy zeal had paid To laws infirm , and liberty decay 'd ; Has begg 'd Ambition to forgive the show ; Has told Corruption thou wert ne'er her foe ; Has boasted in thy country 's awful ear , Her gross delusion when she held thee dear ; 60 How tame she follow 'd thy tempestuous call , And heard thy pompous tales , and trusted all — Rise from your sad abodes , ye cursed of old For laws subverted , and for cities sold ! Paint all the noblest trophies of your guilt , The oaths you perjured , and the blood you spilt ; Yet must you one untempted vileness own , One dreadful palm reserved for him alone ; With studied arts his country 's praise to spurn , To beg the infamy he did not earn , 70 To challenge hate when honour was his due , And plead his crimes where all his virtue knew . Do robes of state the guarded heart enclose From each fair feeling human nature knows ? Can pompous titles stun the enchanted ear To all that reason , all that sense would hear ? Else couldst thou e'er desert thy sacred post , In such unthankful baseness to be lost ? Else couldst thou wed the emptiness of vice , And yield thy glories at an idiot 's price ? 80</p>
    <p n="149">When they who , loud for liberty and laws , In doubtful times had fought their country 's cause , When now of conquest and dominion sure , They sought alone to hold their fruits secure ; When taught by these , Oppression hid the face , To leave Corruption stronger in her place , By silent spells to work the public fate , And taint the vitals of the passive state , Till healing Wisdom should avail no more , And Freedom loathe to tread the poison 'd shore : 90 Then , like some guardian god that flies to save The weary pilgrim from an instant grave , Whom , sleeping and secure , the guileful snake Steals near and nearer through the peaceful brake ; Then Curio rose to ward the public woe , To wake the heedless , and incite the slow , Against Corruption Liberty to arm , And quell the enchantress by a mightier charm .</p>
    <p n="150">Swift o'er the land the fair contagion flew , And with thy country 's hopes thy honours grew . 100 Thee , patriot , the patrician roof confess 'd ; Thy powerful voice the rescued merchant bless 'd ; Of thee with awe the rural hearth resounds ; The bowl to thee the grateful sailor crowns ; Touch 'd in the sighing shade with manlier fires , To trace thy steps the love-sick youth aspires ; The learn 'd recluse , who oft amazed had read Of Grecian heroes , Roman patriots dead , With new amazement hears a living name Pretend to share in such forgotten fame ; 110 And he who , scorning courts and courtly ways , Left the tame track of these dejected days , The life of nobler ages to renew In virtues sacred from a monarch 's view , Roused by thy labours from the bless 'd retreat , Where social ease and public passions meet , Again ascending treads the civil scene , To act and be a man , as thou hadst been .</p>
    <p n="151">Thus by degrees thy cause superior grew , And the great end appear 'd at last in view : 120 We heard the people in thy hopes rejoice , We saw the senate bending to thy voice ; The friends of freedom hail 'd the approaching reign Of laws for which our fathers bled in vain ; While venal Faction , struck with new dismay , Shrunk at their frown , and self-abandon 'd lay . Waked in the shock the public Genius rose , Abash 'd and keener from his long repose ; Sublime in ancient pride , he raised the spear Which slaves and tyrants long were wont to fear ; 130 The city felt his call : from man to man , From street to street , the glorious horror ran ; Each crowded haunt was stirr 'd beneath his power , And , murmuring , challenged the deciding hour .</p>
    <p n="152">Lo ! the deciding hour at last appears ; The hour of every freeman 's hopes and fears ! Thou , Genius ! guardian of the Roman name , O ever prompt tyrannic rage to tame ! Instruct the mighty moments as they roll , And guide each movement steady to the goal . 140 Ye spirits by whose providential art Succeeding motives turn the changeful heart , Keep , keep the best in view to Curio 's mind , And watch his fancy , and his passions bind ! Ye shades immortal , who by Freedom led , Or in the field or on the scaffold bled , Bend from your radiant seats a joyful eye , And view the crown of all your labours nigh . See Freedom mounting her eternal throne ! The sword submitted , and the laws her own : 150 See ! public Power chastised beneath her stands , With eyes intent , and uncorrupted hands ! See private Life by wisest arts reclaim 'd ! See ardent youth to noblest manners framed ! See us acquire whate'er was sought by you , If Curio , only Curio will be true .</p>
    <p n="153">‘ Twas then — o shame ! O trust how ill repaid ! O Latium , oft by faithless sons betray 'd !— ‘ Twas then — What frenzy on thy reason stole ? What spells unsinewed thy determined soul ?— 160 Is this the man in Freedom 's cause approved , The man so great , so honour 'd , so beloved , This patient slave by tinsel chains allured , This wretched suitor for a boon abjured , This Curio , hated and despised by all , Who fell himself to work his country 's fall ? O lost , alike to action and repose ! Unknown , unpitied in the worst of woes ! With all that conscious , undissembled pride , Sold to the insults of a foe defied ! 170 With all that habit of familiar fame , Doom 'd to exhaust the dregs of life in shame ! The sole sad refuge of thy baffled art To act a statesman 's dull , exploded part , Renounce the praise no longer in thy power , Display thy virtue , though without a dower , Contemn the giddy crowd , the vulgar wind , And shut thy eyes that others may be blind .— Forgive me , Romans , that I bear to smile , When shameless mouths your majesty defile , 180 Paint you a thoughtless , frantic , headlong crew , And cast their own impieties on you . For witness , Freedom , to whose sacred power My soul was vow 'd from reason 's earliest hour , How have I stood exulting , to survey My country 's virtues , opening in thy ray ! How with the sons of every foreign shore The more I match 'd them , honour 'd hers the more ! O race erect ! whose native strength of soul , Which kings , nor priests , nor sordid laws control , 190 Bursts the tame round of animal affairs , And seeks a nobler centre for its cares ; Intent the laws of life to comprehend , And fix dominion 's limits by its end . Who , bold and equal in their love or hate , By conscious reason judging every state , The man forget not , though in rags he lies , And know the mortal through a crown 's disguise : Thence prompt alike with witty scorn to view Fastidious Grandeur lift his solemn brow , 200 Or , all awake at pity 's soft command , Bend the mild ear , and stretch the gracious hand : Thence large of heart , from envy far removed , When public toils to virtue stand approved , Not the young lover fonder to admire , Not more indulgent the delighted sire ; Yet high and jealous of their free-born name , Fierce as the flight of Jove 's destroying flame , Where'er Oppression works her wanton sway , Proud to confront , and dreadful to repay . 210 But if to purchase Curio 's sage applause , My country must with him renounce her cause , Quit with a slave the path a patriot trod , Bow the meek knee , and kiss the regal rod ; Then still , ye powers , instruct his tongue to rail , Nor let his zeal , nor let his subject fail : Else , ere he change the style , bear me away To where the Gracchi<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>, where the Bruti stay !</p>
    <p n="154">O long revered , and late resign 'd to shame ! If this uncourtly page thy notice claim 220 When the loud cares of business are withdrawn , Nor well-dress 'd beggars round thy footsteps fawn ; In that still , thoughtful , solitary hour , When Truth exerts her unresisted power , Breaks the false optics tinged with fortune 's glare , Unlocks the breast , and lays the passions bare ; Then turn thy eyes on that important scene , And ask thyself — if all be well within . Where is the heart-felt worth and weight of soul , Which labour could not stop , nor fear control ? 230 Where the known dignity , the stamp of awe , Which , half-abash 'd , the proud and venal saw ? Where the calm triumphs of an honest cause ? Where the delightful taste of just applause ? Where the strong reason , the commanding tongue , On which the senate fired or trembling hung ? All vanish 'd , all are sold — and in their room , Couch 'd in thy bosom 's deep , distracted gloom , See the pale form of barbarous Grandeur dwell , Like some grim idol in a sorcerer 's cell ! 210 To her in chains thy dignity was led ; At her polluted shrine thy honour bled ; With blasted weeds thy awful brow she crown 'd , Thy powerful tongue with poison 'd philters bound , That baffled Reason straight indignant flew , And fair Persuasion from her seat withdrew : For now no longer Truth supports thy cause ; No longer Glory prompts thee to applause ; No longer Virtue breathing in thy breast , With all her conscious majesty confess 'd , 250 Still bright and brighter wakes the almighty flame , To rouse the feeble , and the wilful tame , And where she sees the catching glimpses roll , Spreads the strong blaze , and all involves the soul ; But cold restraints thy conscious fancy chill , And formal passions mock thy struggling will ; Or , if thy Genius e'er forget his chain , And reach impatient at a nobler strain , Soon the sad bodings of contemptuous mirth Shoot through thy breast , and stab the generous birth , 260 Till , blind with smart , from truth to frenzy toss 'd , And all the tenor of thy reason lost , Perhaps thy anguish drains a real tear ; While some with pity , some with laughter hear .— Can art , alas ! or genius , guide the head , Where truth and freedom from the heart are fled ? Can lesser wheels repeat their native stroke , When the prime function of the soul is broke ?</p>
    <p n="155">But come , unhappy man ! thy fates impend ; Come , quit thy friends , if yet thou hast a friend ; 270 Turn from the poor rewards of guilt like thine , Renounce thy titles , and thy robes resign ; For see the hand of Destiny display 'd To shut thee from the joys thou hast betray 'd ! See the dire fane of Infamy arise ! Dark as the grave , and spacious as the skies ; Where , from the first of time , thy kindred train , The chiefs and princes of the unjust remain . Eternal barriers guard the pathless road To warn the wanderer of the cursed abode ; 280 But prone as whirlwinds scour the passive sky , The heights surmounted , down the steep they fly . There , black with frowns , relentless Time awaits , And goads their footsteps to the guilty gates ; And still he asks them of their unknown aims , Evolves their secrets , and their guilt proclaims ; And still his hands despoil them on the road Of each vain wreath , by lying bards bestow 'd , Break their proud marbles , crush their festal cars , And rend the lawless trophies of their wars . 290</p>
    <p n="156">At last the gates his potent voice obey ; Fierce to their dark abode he drives his prey ; Where , ever arm 'd with adamantine chains , The watchful demon o'er her vassals reigns , O'er mighty names and giant-powers of lust , The great , the sage , the happy , and august<span corresp="#note3_2" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>. No gleam of hope their baleful mansion cheers , No sound of honour hails their unbless 'd ears ; But dire reproaches from the friend betray 'd , The childless sire and violated maid ; 300 But vengeful vows for guardian laws effaced , From towns enslaved , and continents laid waste ; But long posterity 's united groan , And the sad charge of horrors not their own , For ever through the trembling space resound , And sink each impious forehead to the ground .</p>
    <p n="157">Ye mighty foes of liberty and rest , Give way , do homage to a mightier guest ! Ye daring spirits of the Roman race , See Curio 's toil your proudest claims efface !— 310 Awed at the name , fierce Appius<span corresp="#note4" type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>rising bends , And hardy Cinna from his throne attends : ‘ He comes , ’ they cry , ‘ to whom the fates assign 'd With surer arts to work what we design 'd , From year to year the stubborn herd to sway , Mouth all their wrongs , and all their rage obey ; Till own 'd their guide , and trusted with their power , He mock 'd their hopes in one decisive hour ; Then , tired and yielding , led them to the chain , And quench 'd the spirit we provoked in vain . ’ 320</p>
    <p n="158">But thou , Supreme , by whose eternal hands Fair Liberty 's heroic empire stands ; Whose thunders the rebellious deep control , And quell the triumphs of the traitor 's soul , Oh ! turn this dreadful omen far away : On Freedom 's foes their own attempts repay : Relume her sacred fire so near suppress 'd , And fix her shrine in every Roman breast : Though bold Corruption boast around the land , ‘ Let virtue , if she can , my baits withstand ! ’ 330 Though bolder now she urge the accursed claim , Gay with her trophies raised on Curio 's shame ; Yet some there are who scorn her impious mirth , Who know what conscience and a heart are worth .— O friend and father of the human mind , Whose art for noblest ends our frame design 'd ! If I , though fated to the studious shade Which party-strife , nor anxious power invade , If I aspire in public virtue 's cause , To guide the Muses by sublimer laws , 340 Do thou her own authority impart , And give my numbers entrance to the heart . Perhaps the verse might rouse her smother 'd flame , And snatch the fainting patriot back to fame ; Perhaps by worthy thoughts of human kind , To worthy deeds exalt the conscious mind ; Or dash Corruption in her proud career , And teach her slaves that Vice was born to fear .</p>
    <note xml:id="note1_6" place="bottom" n="1">Curio was a young Roman senator , of distinguished birth and parts , who , upon his first entrance into the forum , had been committed to the care of Cicero . Being profuse and extravagant , he soon dissipated a large and splendid fortune ; to supply the want of which , he was driven to the necessity of abetting the designs of Csesar against the liberties of his country , although he had before been a professed enemy to him . Cicero exerted himself with great energy to prevent his ruin , but without effect , and he became one of the first victims in the civil war . This epistle was first published in the year 1744 , when a celebrated patriot , after a long and at last successful opposition to an unpopular minister , had deserted the cause of his country , and became the foremost in support and defence of the same measures he had so steadily and for such a length of time contended against .</note>

    <p n="160">THE VIRTUOSO .</p>
    <p n="161">IN IMITATION OP SPENSER 'S STYLE AND STANZA .</p>
    <p n="162">‘ Videmus Nugari solitos . ’ — PERSIUS .</p>
    <p n="163">1 Whilom by silver Thames 's gentle stream , In London town there dwelt a subtile wight ; A wight of mickle wealth , and mickle fame , Book-learn 'd and quaint ; a Virtuoso hight . Uncommon things , and rare , were his delight ; From musings deep his brain ne'er gotten ease , Nor ceasen he from study , day or night ; Until ( advancing onward by degrees ) He knew whatever breeds on earth , or air , or seas .</p>
    <p n="164">2 He many a creature did anatomise , Almost unpeopling water , air , and land ; Beasts , fishes , birds , snails , caterpillars , flies , Were laid full low by his relentless hand , That oft with gory crimson was distain 'd : He many a dog destroy 'd , and many a cat ; Of fleas his bed , of frogs the marshes drain 'd , Could tellen if a mite were lean or fat , And read a lecture o'er the entrails of a gnat .</p>
    <p n="165">3 He knew the various modes of ancient times , Their arts and fashions of each different guise , Their weddings , funerals , punishments for crimes , Their strength , their learning eke , and rarities ; Of old habiliments , each sort and size , Male , female , high and low , to him were known ; Each gladiator-dress , and stage disguise ; With learned , clerkly phrase he could have shown How the Greek tunic differ 'd from the Roman gown .</p>
    <p n="166">4 A curious medalist , I wot , he was , And boasted many a course of ancient coin ; Well as his wife 's he knewen every face , From Julius Caesar down to Constantine : For some rare sculptor he would oft ypine ( As green-sick damosels for husbands do ) ; And when obtained , with enraptured eyne , He 'd run it o'er and o'er with greedy view , And look , and look again , as he would look it through .</p>
    <p n="167">5 His rich museum , of dimensions fair , With goods that spoke the owner 's mind was fraught : Things ancient , curious , value-worth , and rare , From sea and land , from Greece and Rome were brought , Which he with mighty sums of gold had bought : On these all tides with joyous eyes he pored ; And , sooth to say , himself he greater thought , When he beheld his cabinets thus stored , Than if he 'd been of Albion 's wealthy cities lord .</p>
    <p n="168">6 Here in a corner stood a rich scrutoire , With many a curiosity replete ; In seemly order furnish 'd every drawer , Products of art or nature as was meet ; Air-pumps and prisms were placed beneath his feet , A Memphian mummy-king hung o'er his head ; Here phials with live insects small and great , There stood a tripod of the Pythian maid ; Above , a crocodile diffused a grateful shade .</p>
    <p n="169">7 Fast by the window did a table stand , Where modern and antique rarities , From Egypt , Greece , and Rome , from sea and land , Were thick-besprent , of every sort and size : Here a Bahaman-spider 's carcass lies , There a dire serpent 's golden skin doth shine ; Here Indian feathers , fruits , and glittering flies ; There gums and amber found beneath the line , The beak of Ibis here , and there an Antonine .</p>
    <p n="170">8 Close at his back , or whispering in his ear , There stood a sprite ycleped Phantasy ; Which , wheresoe'er he went , was always near : Her look was wild , and roving was her eye ; Her hair was clad with flowers of every dye ; Her glistering robes were of more various hue Than the fair bow that paints the cloudy sky , Or all the spangled drops of morning dew ; Their colour changing still at every different view .</p>
    <p n="171">9 Yet in this shape all tides she did not stay , Various as the chameleon that she bore ; Now a grand monarch with a crown of hay , Now mendicant in silks and golden ore : A statesman , now equipp 'd to chase the boar , Or cowled monk , lean , feeble , and unfed ; A clown-like lord , or swain of courtly lore ; Now scribbling dunce , in sacred laurel clad , Or papal father now , in homely weeds array 'd .</p>
    <p n="172">10 The wight whose brain this phantom 's power doth fill , On whom she doth with constant care attend , Will for a dreadful giant take a mill , Or a grand palace in a hog-sty find : ( From her dire influence me may heaven defend ! ) All things with vitiated sight he spies ; Neglects his family , forgets his friend , Seeks painted trifles and fantastic toys , And eagerly pursues imaginary joys .</p>
    <p n="173">AMBITION AND CONTENT .</p>
    <p n="174">A FABLE .</p>
    <p n="175">‘ Optat quietem . ’ -HOR .</p>
    <p n="176">While yet the world was young , and men were few , Nor lurking fraud , nor tyrant rapine knew , In virtue rude , the gaudy arts they scorn 'd , Which , virtue lost , degenerate times adorn 'd : No sumptuous fabrics yet were seen to rise , Nor gushing fountains taught to invade the skies ; With nature , art had not begun the strife , Nor swelling marble rose to mimic life ; No pencil yet had learn 'd to express the fair ; The bounteous earth was all their homely care . 10</p>
    <p n="177">Then did Content exert her genial sway , And taught the peaceful world her power to obey — Content , a female of celestial race , Bright and complete in each celestial grace . Serenely fair she was , as rising day , And brighter than the sun 's meridian ray ; Joy of all hearts , delight of every eye , Nor grief nor pain appear 'd when she was by ; Her presence from the wretched banish 'd care , Dispersed the swelling sigh , and stopp 'd the falling tear . 20</p>
    <p n="178">Long did the nymph her regal state maintain , As long mankind were bless 'd beneath her reign ; Till dire Ambition , hellish fiend , arose To plague the world , and banish man 's repose , A monster sprung from that rebellious crew Which mighty Jove 's Phlegraean thunder slew . Resolved to dispossess the royal fair , On all her friends he threaten 'd open war ; Fond of the novelty , vain , fickle man In crowds to his infernal standard ran ; 30 And the weak maid , defenceless left alone , To avoid his rage , was forced to quit the throne .</p>
    <p n="179">It chanced , as wandering through the fields she stray 'd , Forsook of all , and destitute of aid , Upon a rising mountain 's flowery side , A pleasant cottage , roof 'd with turf , she spied : Fast by a gloomy , venerable wood Of shady planes and ancient oaks it stood . Around , a various prospect charm 'd the sight ; Here waving harvests clad the field with white , 40 Here a rough shaggy rock the clouds did pierce , From which a torrent rush 'd with rapid force ; Here mountain-woods diffused a dusky shade ; Here flocks and herds in flowery valleys play 'd , While o'er the matted grass the liquid crystal stray 'd . In this sweet place there dwelt a cheerful pair , Though bent beneath the weight of many a year ; Who , wisely flying public noise and strife , In this obscure retreat had pass 'd their life ; The husband Industry was call 'd , Frugality the wife . 50 With tenderest friendship mutually bless 'd , No household jars had e'er disturbed their rest . A numerous offspring graced their homely board , That still with nature 's simple gifts was stored .</p>
    <p n="180">The father rural business only knew ; The sons the same delightful art pursue . An only daughter , as a goddess fair , Above the rest was the fond mother 's care , Plenty ; the brightest nymph of all the plain , Each heart 's delight , adored by every swain . 60 Soon as Content this charming scene espied , Joyful within herself the goddess cried :— ‘ This happy sight my drooping heart doth raise ; The gods , I hope , will grant me gentler days . When with prosperity my life was bless 'd , In yonder house I 've been a welcome guest : There now , perhaps , I may protection find ; For royalty is banish 'd from my mind ; I 'll thither haste : how happy should I be , If such a refuge were reserved for me ! ’ 70</p>
    <p n="181">Thus spoke the fair ; and straight she bent her way To the tall mountain , where the cottage lay : Arrived , she makes her changed condition known ; Tells how the rebels drove her from the throne ; What painful , dreary wilds she 'd wander 'd o'er ; And shelter from the tyrant doth implore .</p>
    <p n="182">The faithful , aged pair at once were seized With joy and grief , at once were pain 'd and pleased ; Grief for their banish 'd queen their hearts ’ possess 'd , And joy succeeded for their future guest : 80 ‘ And if you 'll deign , bright goddess , here to dwell , And with your presence grace our humble cell , Whate'er the gods have given with bounteous hand , Our harvest , fields , and flocks , our all command . ’</p>
    <p n="183">Meantime , Ambition , on his rival 's flight , Sole lord of man , attain 'd his wish 's height ; Of all dependence on his subjects eased , He raged without a curb , and did whate'er he pleased ; As some wild flame , driven on by furious winds , Wide spreads destruction , nor resistance finds ; 90 So rush 'd the fiend destructive o'er the plain , Defaced the labours of th ’ industrious swain ; Polluted every stream with human gore , And scatter 'd plagues and death from shore to shore .</p>
    <p n="184">Great Jove beheld it from the Olympian towers , Where sate assembled all the heavenly powers ; Then with a nod that shook the empyrean throne , Thus the Saturnian thunderer begun :— ‘ You see , immortal inmates of the skies , How this vile wretch almighty power defies ; 100 His daring crimes , the blood which he has spilt , Demand a torment equal to his guilt . Then , Cyprian goddess , let thy mighty boy Swift to the tyrant 's guilty palace fly ; There let him choose his sharpest , hottest dart , And with his former rival wound his heart . And thou , my son ( the god to Hermes said ) , Snatch up thy wand , and plume thy heels and head ; Dart through the yielding air with all thy force , And down to Pluto 's realms direct thy course ; 110 There rouse Oblivion from her sable cave , Where dull she sits by Lethe 's sluggish wave ; Command her to secure the sacred bound . Where lives Content retired , and all around Diffuse the deepest glooms of Stygian night , And screen the virgin from the tyrant 's sight ; That the vain purpose of his life may try Still to explore , what still eludes his eye . ’ He spoke ; loud praises shake the bright abode , And all applaud the justice of the god . 120</p>
    <p n="185">THE POET . A RHAPSODY .</p>
    <p n="186">Of all the various lots around the ball , Which fate to man distributes , absolute , Avert , ye gods ! that of the Muse 's son , Cursed with dire poverty ! poor hungry wretch ! What shall he do for life ? He cannot work With manual labour ; shall those sacred hands , That brought the counsels of the gods to light ; Shall that inspirèd tongue , which every Muse Has touch 'd divine , to charm the sons of men ; These hallow 'd organs ! these ! be prostitute 10 To the vile service of some fool in power , All his behests submissive to perform , Howe'er to him ungrateful ? Oh ! he scorns The ignoble thought ; with generous disdain , More eligible deeming it to starve , Like his famed ancestors renown 'd in verse , Than poorly bend to be another 's slave ,— Than feed and fatten in obscurity .— These are his firm resolves , which fate , nor time , Nor poverty can shake . Exalted high 20 In garret vile he lives ; with remnants hung Of tapestry . But oh ! precarious state Of this vain transient world ! all-powerful Time , What dost thou not subdue ? See what a chasm Gapes wide , tremendous ! see where Saul , enraged , High on his throne , encompass 'd by his guards , With levell 'd spear , and arm extended , sits , Ready to pierce old Jesse 's valiant son , Spoil 'd of his nose !— around in tottering ranks , On shelves pulverulent , majestic stands 30 His library ; in ragged plight , and old ; Replete with many a load of criticism , Elaborate products of the midnight toil Of Belgian brains ; snatch 'd from the deadly hands Of murderous grocer , or the careful wight , Who vends the plant , that clads the happy shore Of Indian Patomac ; which citizens In balmy fumes exhale , when , o'er a pot Of sage-inspiring coffee , they dispose Of kings and crowns , and settle Europe 's fate . 40</p>
    <p n="187">Elsewhere the dome is fill 'd with various heaps Of old domestic lumber ; that huge chair Has seen six monarchs fill the British throne : Here a broad massy table stands , o'erspread With ink and pens , and scrolls replete with rhyme : Chests , stools , old razors , fractured jars , half-full Of muddy Zythum , sour and spiritless : Fragments of verse , hose , sandals , utensils Of various fashion , and of various use , With friendly influence hide the sable floor . 50</p>
    <p n="188">This is the bard 's museum , this the fane To Phoebus sacred , and the Aonian maids : But , oh ! it stabs his heart , that niggard fate To him in such small measure should dispense Her better gifts : to him ! whose generous soul Could relish , with as fine an elegance , The golden joys of grandeur , and of wealth ; He who could tyrannise o'er menial slaves , Or swell beneath a coronet of state , Or grace a gilded chariot with a mien , 60 Grand as the haughtiest Timon of them all .</p>
    <p n="189">But ‘ tis in vain to rave at destiny : Here he must rest and brook the best he can , To live remote from grandeur , learning , wit ; Immured amongst th ’ ignoble , vulgar herd , Of lowest intellect ; whose stupid souls But half inform their bodies ; brains of lead And tongues of thunder ; whose insensate breasts Ne'er felt the rapturous , soul-entrancing fire Of the celestial Muse ; whose savage ears 70 Ne'er heard the sacred rules , nor even the names Of the Venusian bard , or critic sage Full-famed of Stagyra : whose clamorous tongues Stun the tormented ear with colloquy , Vociferate , trivial , or impertinent ; Replete with boorish scandal ; yet , alas ! This , this ! he must endure , or muse alone , Pensive and moping o'er the stubborn rhyme , Or line imperfect — No ! the door is free , And calls him to evade their deafening clang , 80 By private ambulation ;— ‘ tis resolved : Off from his waist he throws the tatter 'd gown , Beheld with indignation ; and unloads His pericranium of the weighty cap , With sweat and grease discolour 'd : then explores The spacious chest , and from its hollow womb Draws his best robe , yet not from tincture free Of age 's reverend russet , scant and bare ; Then down his meagre visage waving flows The shadowy peruke ; crown 'd with gummy hat 90 Clean brush 'd ; a cane supports him . Thus equipp 'd He sallies forth ; swift traverses the streets , And seeks the lonely walk .— ‘ Hail , sylvan scenes , Ye groves , ye valleys , ye meandering brooks , Admit me to your joys ! ’ in rapturous phrase , Loud he exclaims ; while with the inspiring Muse His bosom labours ; and all other thoughts , Pleasure and wealth , and poverty itself , Before her influence vanish . Rapt in thought , Fancy presents before his ravish 'd eyes 100 Distant posterity , upon his page With transport dwelling ; while bright learning 's sons That ages hence must tread this earthly ball , Indignant , seem to curse the thankless age , That starved such merit . Meantime swallow 'd up , In meditation deep , he wanders on , Unweeting of his way .— But , ah ! he starts With sudden fright ! his glaring eyeballs roll , Pale turn his cheeks , and shake his loosen 'd joints ; His cogitations vanish into air , 110 Like painted bubbles , or a morning dream . Behold the cause ! see ! through the opening glade , With rosy visage , and abdomen grand , A cit , a dun !— As in Apulia 's wilds , Or where the Thracian Hebrus rolls his wave , A heedless kid , disportive , roves around , Unheeding , till upon the hideous cave On the dire wolf she treads ; half-dead she views His bloodshot eyeballs , and his dreadful fangs , And swift as Eurus from the monster flies . 120 So fares the trembling bard ; amazed he turns , Scarce by his legs upborne ; yet fear supplies The place of strength ; straight home he bends his course , Nor looks behind him till he safe regain His faithful citadel ; there , spent , fatigued , He lays him down to ease his heaving lungs , Quaking , and of his safety scarce convinced . Soon as the panic leaves his panting breast , Down to the Muse 's sacred rites he sits , Volumes piled round him ; see ! upon his brow 130 Perplex 'd anxiety , and struggling thought , Painful as female throes : whether the bard Display the deeds of heroes ; or the fall Of vice , in lay dramatic ; or expand The lyric wing ; or in elegiac strains Lament the fair ; or lash the stubborn age , With laughing satire ; or in rural scenes With shepherds sport ; or rack his hard-bound brains For the unexpected turn . Arachne so , In dusty kitchen corner , from her bowels 140 Spins the fine web , but spins with better fate , Than the poor bard : she ! caitiff ! spreads her snares , And with their aid enjoys luxurious life , Bloated with fat of insects , flesh 'd in blood : He ! hard , hard lot ! for all his toil and care , And painful watchings , scarce protracts a while His meagre , hungry days ! ungrateful world ! If with his drama he adorn the stage , No worth-discerning concourse pays the charge . Or of the orchestra , or the enlightening torch . 150 He who supports the luxury and pride Of craving Lais ; he ! whose carnage fills Dogs , eagles , lions ; has not yet enough , Wherewith to satisfy the greedier maw Of that most ravenous , that devouring beast , Ycleped a poet . What new Halifax , What Somers , or what Dorset canst thou find , Thou hungry mortal ? Break , wretch , break thy quill , Blot out the studied image ; to the flames</p>
    <p n="190">Commit the Stagyrite ; leave this thankless trade ; 160 Erect some pedling stall , with trinkets stock 'd , There earn thy daily halfpence , nor again Trust the false Muse ; so shall the cleanly meal Repel intruding hunger .— Oh ! ‘ tis vain , The friendly admonition 's all in vain ; The scribbling itch has seized him , he is lost To all advice , and starves for starving 's sake .</p>
    <p n="191">Thus sung the sportful Muse , in mirthful mood , Indulging gay the frolic vein of youth ; But , oh ! ye gods , avert th ’ impending stroke 170 This luckless omen threatens ! Hark ! methinks I hear my better angel cry , ‘ Retreat , Rash youth ! in time retreat ; let those poor bards , Who slighted all , all ! for the flattering Muse , Yet cursed with pining want , as landmarks stand , To warn thee from the service of the ingrate . ’</p>
    <p n="192">A BRITISH PHILIPPIC .</p>
    <p n="193">OCCASIONED BY THE INSULTS OF THE SPANIARDS , AND THE PRESENT PREPARATIONS FOR WAR . 1738 .</p>
    <p n="194">Whence this unwonted transport in my breast ? Why glow my thoughts , and whither would the Muse Aspire with rapid wing ? Her country 's cause Demands her efforts : at that sacred call She summons all her ardour , throws aside The trembling lyre , and with the warrior 's trump She means to thunder in each British ear ; And if one spark of honour or of fame , Disdain of insult , dread of infamy , One thought of public virtue yet survive , 10 She means to wake it , rouse the generous flame , With patriot zeal inspirit every breast , And fire each British heart with British wrongs .</p>
    <p n="195">Alas , the vain attempt ! what influence now Can the Muse boast ! or what attention now Is paid to fame or virtue ? Where is now The British spirit , generous , warm , and brave , So frequent wont from tyranny and woe To free the suppliant nations ? Where , indeed ! If that protection , once to strangers given , 20 Be now withheld from sons ? Each nobler thought , That warrn 'd our sires , is lost and buried now In luxury and avarice . Baneful vice ! How it unmans a nation ! yet I 'll try , I 'll aim to shake this vile degenerate sloth ; I 'll dare to rouse Britannia 's dreaming sons To fame , to virtue , and impart around A generous feeling of compatriot woes .</p>
    <p n="196">Come , then , the various powers of forceful speech , All that can move , awaken , fire , transport ! 30 Come the bold ardour of the Theban bard ! The arousing thunder of the patriot Greek ! The soft persuasion of the Roman sage ! Come all ! and raise me to an equal height , A rapture worthy of my glorious cause ! Lest my best efforts , failing , should debase The sacred theme ; for with no common wing The Muse attempts to soar . Yet what need these ? My country 's fame , my free-born British heart , Shall be my best inspirers , raise my flight 40 High as the Theban 's pinion , and with more Than Greek or Roman flame exalt my soul . Oh ! could I give the vast ideas birth Expressive of the thoughts that flame within , No more should lazy Luxury detain Our ardent youth ; no more should Britain 's sons Sit tamely passive by , and careless hear The prayers , sighs , groans , ( immortal infamy ! ) Of fellow Britons , with oppression sunk , In bitterness of soul demanding aid , 50 Calling on Britain , their dear native land , The land of Liberty ; so greatly famed For just redress ; the land so often dyed With her best blood , for that arousing cause , The freedom of her sons ; those sons that now Far from the manly blessings of her sway , Drag the vile fetters of a Spanish lord . And dare they , dare the vanquish 'd sons of Spain Enslave a Briton ? Have they then forgot , So soon forgot , the great , the immortal day , 60 When rescued Sicily with joy beheld The swift-wing 'd thunder of the British arm Disperse their navies ? when their coward bands Fled , like the raven from the bird of Jove , From swift impending vengeance fled in vain ? Are these our lords ? And can Britannia see Her foes oft vanquish 'd , thus defy her power , Insult her standard , and enslave her sons , And not arise to justice ? Did our sires , Unawed by chains , by exile , or by death , 70 Preserve inviolate her guardian rights , To Britons ever sacred , that her sons Might give them up to Spaniards ?— Turn your eyes , Turn , ye degenerate , who with haughty boast Call yourselves Britons , to that dismal gloom , That dungeon dark and deep , where never thought Of joy or peace can enter ; see the gates Harsh-creaking open ; what a hideous void , Dark as the yawning grave , while still as death A frightful silence reigns ! There on the ground 80 Behold your brethren chain 'd like beasts of prey : There mark your numerous glories , there behold The look that speaks unutterable woe ; The mangled limb , the faint , the deathful eye , With famine sunk , the deep heart-bursting groan , Suppress 'd in silence ; view the loathsome food , Refused by dogs , and oh ! the stinging thought ! View the dark Spaniard glorying in their wrongs , The deadly priest triumphant in their woes , And thundering worse damnation on their souls : 90 While that pale form , in all the pangs of death , Too faint to speak , yet eloquent of all , His native British spirit yet untamed , Raises his head ; and with indignant frown Of great defiance , and superior scorn , Looks up and dies .— Oh ! I am all on fire ! But let me spare the theme , lest future times Should blush to hear that either conquer 'd Spain Durst offer Britain such outrageous wrong , Or Britain tamely bore it — 100 Descend , ye guardian heroes of the land ! Scourges of Spain , descend ! Behold your sons ; See ! how they run the same heroic race , How prompt , how ardent in their country 's cause , How greatly proud to assert their British blood , And in their deeds reflect their fathers ’ fame ! Ah ! would to heaven ye did not rather see How dead to virtue in the public cause , How cold , how careless , how to glory deaf , They shame your laurels , and belie their birth ! 110</p>
    <p n="197">Come , ye great spirits , Candish , Raleigh , Blake ! And ye of latter name , your country 's pride , Oh ! come , disperse these lazy fumes of sloth , Teach British hearts with British fires to glow ! In wakening whispers rouse our ardent youth , Blazon the triumphs of your better days , Paint all the glorious scenes of rightful war In all its splendours ; to their swelling souls Say how ye bow 'd th ’ insulting Spaniards ’ pride , Say how ye thunder 'd o'er their prostrate heads , 120 Say how ye broke their lines and fired their ports , Say how not death , in all its frightful shapes , Could damp your souls , or shake the great resolve For right and Britain : then display the joys The patriot 's soul exalting , while he views Transported millions hail with loud acclaim The guardian of their civil , sacred rights . How greatly welcome to the virtuous man Is death for others ’ good ! the radiant thoughts That beam celestial on his passing soul , 130 The unfading crowns awaiting him above , The exalting plaudit of the Great Supreme , Who in his actions with complacence views His own reflected splendour ; then descend , Though to a lower , yet a nobler scene ; Paint the just honours to his relics paid , Show grateful millions weeping o'er his grave ; While his fair fame in each progressive age For ever brightens ; and the wise and good Of every land in universal choir 140 With richest incense of undying praise His urn encircle , to the wondering world His numerous triumphs blazon ; while with awe , With filial reverence , in his steps they tread , And , copying every virtue , every fame , Transplant his glories into second life , And , with unsparing hand , make nations bless 'd By his example . Vast , immense rewards ! For all the turmoils which the virtuous mind Encounters here . Yet , Britons , are ye cold ? 150 Yet deaf to glory , virtue , and the call Of your poor injured countrymen ? Ah ! no : I see ye are not ; every bosom glows With native greatness , and in all its state The British spirit rises : glorious change ! Fame , virtue , freedom , welcome ! Oh , forgive The Muse , that , ardent in her sacred cause , Your glory question 'd ; she beholds with joy , She owns , she triumphs in her wish 'd mistake . See ! from her sea-beat throne in awful march 160 Britannia towers : upon her laurel crest The plumes majestic nod ; behold , she heaves Her guardian shield , and terrible in arms For battle shakes her adamantine spear : Loud at her foot the British lion roars , Frighting the nations ; haughty Spain full soon Shall hear and tremble . Go then , Britons , forth , Your country 's daring champions : tell your foes Tell them in thunders o'er their prostrate land , You were not born for slaves : let all your deeds 170 Show that the sons of those immortal men , The stars of shining story , are not slow In virtue 's path to emulate their sires , To assert their country 's rights , avenge her sons , And hurl the bolts of justice on her foes .</p>

    <p n="207">8 Then launch through Being 's wide extent ; Let the fair scale with just ascent And cautious steps be trod ; And from the dead , corporeal mass , Through each progressive order pass To Instinct , Reason , God .</p>
    <p n="208">9 There , Science ! veil thy daring eye ; Nor dive too deep , nor soar too high , In that divine abyss ; To Faith content thy beams to lend , Her hopes to assure , her steps befriend And light her way to bliss .</p>
    <p n="209">10 Then downwards take thy flight again , Mix with the policies of men , And social Nature 's ties ; The plan , the genius of each state , Its interest and its powers relate , Its fortunes and its rise .</p>
    <p n="210">11 Through private life pursue thy course , Trace every action to its source , And means and motives weigh : Put tempers , passions , in the scale ; Mark what degrees in each prevail , And fix the doubtful sway .</p>
    <p n="211">12 That last best effort of thy skill , To form the life , and rule the will , Propitious power ! impart : Teach me to cool my passion 's fires , Make me the judge of my desires , The master of my heart .</p>
    <p n="212">13 Raise me above the Vulgar 's breath , Pursuit of fortune , fear of death , And all in life that 's mean : Still true to reason be my plan , Still let my actions speak the man , Through every various scene .</p>
    <p n="213">14 Hail ! queen of manners , light of truth ; Hail ! charm of age , and guide of youth ; Sweet refuge of distress : In business , thou ! exact , polite ; Thou giv'st retirement its delight , Prosperity its grace .</p>
    <p n="214">15 Of wealth , power , freedom , thou the cause ; Foundress of order , cities , laws , Of arts inventress thou ! Without thee , what were human-kind ? How vast their wants , their thoughts how blind ! Their joys how mean , how few !</p>
    <p n="215">16 Sun of the soul ! thy beams unveil : Let others spread the daring sail On Fortune 's faithless sea : While , undeluded , happier I From the rain tumult timely fly , And sit in peace with thee .</p>
    <p n="216">LOVE . AN ELEGY .</p>
    <p n="217">Too much my heart of Beauty 's power hath known , Too long to Love hath reason left her throne ; Too long my genius mourn 'd his myrtle chain , And three rich years of youth consumed in vain . My wishes , lull 'd with soft inglorious dreams , Forgot the patriot 's and the sage 's themes : Through each Elysian vale and fairy grove , Through all the enchanted paradise of love , Misled by sickly Hope 's deceitful flame , Averse to action , and renouncing fame . 10</p>
    <p n="218">At last the visionary scenes decay , My eyes , exulting , bless the new-born day , Whose faithful beams detect the dangerous road In which my heedless feet securely trod , And strip the phantoms of their lying charms That lured my soul from Wisdom 's peaceful arms .</p>
    <p n="219">For silver streams and banks bespread with flowers , For mossy couches and harmonious bowers , Lo ! barren heaths appear , and pathless woods , And rocks hung dreadful o'er unfathom 'd floods : 20 For openness of heart , for tender smiles , Looks fraught with love , and wrath-disarming wiles ; Lo ! sullen Spite , and perjured Lust of Gain , And cruel Pride , and crueller Disdain ; Lo ! cordial Faith to idiot airs refined , Now coolly civil , now transporting kind . For graceful Ease , lo ! Affectation walks ; And dull Half-sense , for Wit and Wisdom talks . New to each hour what low delight succeeds , What precious furniture of hearts and heads ! 30 By nought their prudence , but by getting , known , And all their courage in deceiving shown .</p>
    <p n="220">See next what plagues attend the lover 's state , What frightful forms of Terror , Scorn , and Hate ! See burning Fury heaven and earth defy ! See dumb Despair in icy fetters lie ! See black Suspicion bend his gloomy brow , The hideous image of himself to view ! And fond Belief , with all a lover 's flame , Sink in those arms that point his head with shame ! 40 There wan Dejection , faltering as he goes , In shades and silence vainly seeks repose ; Musing through pathless wilds , consumes the day , Then lost in darkness weeps the hours away . Here the gay crowd of Luxury advance , Some touch the lyre , and others urge the dance : On every head the rosy garland glows , In every hand the golden goblet flows . The Syren views them with exulting eyes , And laughs at bashful Virtue as she flies . 50 But see behind , where Scorn and Want appear , The grave remonstrance and the witty sneer ; See fell Remorse in action , prompt to dart Her snaky poison through the conscious heart ; And Sloth to cancel , with oblivious shame , The fair memorial of recording Fame .</p>
    <p n="221">Are these delights that one would wish to gain ? Is this the Elysium of a sober brain ? To wait for happiness in female smiles , Bear all her scorn , be caught with all her wiles , 60 With prayers , with bribes , with lies , her pity crave , Bless her hard bonds , and boast to be her slave ; To feel , for trifles , a distracting train Of hopes and terrors equally in vain ; This hour to tremble , and the next to glow ; Can Pride , can Sense , can Reason , stoop so low : When Virtue , at an easier price , displays The sacred wreaths of honourable praise ; When Wisdom utters her divine decree , To laugh at pompous Folly , and be free ? 70</p>
    <p n="222">I bid adieu , then , to these woeful scenes ; I bid adieu to all the sex of queens ; Adieu to every suffering , simple soul , That lets a woman 's will his ease control . There laugh , ye witty ; and rebuke , ye grave ! For me , I scorn to boast that I 'm a slave . I bid the whining brotherhood be gone ; Joy to my heart ! my wishes are my own ! Farewell the female heaven , the female hell ; To the great God of Love a glad farewell . 80 Is this the triumph of thy awful name ? Are these the splendid hopes that urged thy aim , When first my bosom own 'd thy haughty sway ? When thus Minerva heard thee , boasting , say — ‘ Go , martial maid , elsewhere thy arts employ , Nor hope to shelter that devoted boy . Go teach the solemn sons of Care and Age , The pensive statesman , and the midnight sage ; The young with me must other lessons prove , Youth calls for Pleasure , Pleasure calls for Love . 90 Behold , his heart thy grave advice disdains ; Behold , I bind him in eternal chains . ’ — Alas ! great Love , how idle was the boast ! Thy chains are broken , and thy lessons lost ; Thy wilful rage has tired my suffering heart , And passion , reason , forced thee to depart . But wherefore dost thou linger on thy way ? Why vainly search for some pretence to stay , When crowds of vassals court thy pleasing yoke , And countless victims bow them to the stroke ? 100 Lo ! round thy shrine a thousand youths advance , Warm with the gentle ardours of romance ; Each longs to assert thy cause with feats of arms , And make the world confess Dulcinea 's charms . Ten thousand girls with flowery chaplets crown 'd , To groves and streams thy tender triumph sound : Each bids the stream in murmurs speak her flame , Each calls the grove to sigh her shepherd 's name . But , if thy pride such easy honour scorn , If nobler trophies must thy toil adorn , 110 Behold yon flowery antiquated maid Bright in the bloom of threescore years display 'd ; Her shalt thou bind in thy delightful chains , And thrill with gentle pangs her wither 'd veins , Her frosty cheek with crimson blushes dye , With dreams of rapture melt her maudlin eye .</p>
    <p n="223">Turn then thy labours to the servile crowd , Entice the wary , and control the proud ; Make the sad miser his best gains forego , The solemn statesman sigh to be a beau , 120 The bold coquette with fondest passion burn , The Bacchanalian o'er his bottle mourn ; And that chief glory of thy power maintain , ‘ To poise ambition in a female brain . ’ Be these thy triumphs ; but no more presume That my rebellious heart will yield thee room : I know thy puny force , thy simple wiles ; I break triumphant through thy flimsy toils ; I see thy dying lamp 's last languid glow , Thy arrows blunted and unbraced thy bow . 130 I feel diviner fires my breast inflame , To active science , and ingenuous fame ; Resume the paths my earliest choice began , And lose , with pride , the lover in the man .</p>

    <p>TO CORDELIA . JULY 1740 . 1 From pompous life 's dull masquerade , From Pride 's pursuits , and Passion 's war , Far , my Cordelia , very far , To thee and me may Heaven assign The silent pleasures of the shade , The joys of peace , unenvied , though divine ! 2 Safe in the calm embowering grove , As thy own lovely brow serene ; Behold the world 's fantastic scene ! What low pursuits employ the great , What tinsel things their wishes move , The forms of Fashion , and the toys of State . 3 In vain are all Contentment 's charms , Her placid mien , her cheerful eye , For look , Cordelia , how they fly ! Allured by Power , Applause , or Gain , They fly her kind protecting arms ; Ah , blind to pleasure , and in love with pain ! 4 Turn , and indulge a fairer view , Smile on the joys which here conspire ; O joys harmonious as my lyre ! O prospect of enchanting things , As ever slumbering poet knew , When Love and Fancy wrapt him in their wings ! 5 Here , no rude storm of Passion blows , But Sports and Smiles , and Virtues play , Cheer 'd by Affection 's purest ray ; The air still breathes Contentment 's balm , And the clear stream of Pleasure flows For ever active , yet for ever calm . SONG . 1 The shape alone let others prize , The features of the fair ; I look for spirit in her eyes , And meaning in her air ; 2 A damask cheek , an ivory arm , Shall ne'er my wishes win : Give me an animated form , That speaks a mind within ; 3 A face where awful honour shines , Where sense and sweetness move , And angel innocence refines The tenderness of love . 4 These are the soul of Beauty 's frame ; Without whose vital aid , Unfinish 'd all her features seem , And all her roses dead . 5 But , ah ! where both their charms unite , How perfect is the view , With every image of delight , With graces ever new : 6 Of power to charm the greatest woe , The wildest rage control , Diffusing mildness o'er the brow , And rapture through the soul . 7 Their power but faintly to express , All language must despair ; But go , behold Arpasia 's face , And read it perfect there . END OF AKENSIDE 'S POETICAL WORKS .</p>
