    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Upon a time , before the faery broods</l>
     <l n="2">Drove Nymph and Satyr from the prosperous woods ,</l>
     <l n="3">Before King Oberon 's bright diadem ,</l>
     <l n="4">Sceptre , and mantle , clasp 'd with dewy gem ,</l>
     <l n="5">Frighted away the Dryads and the Fauns</l>
     <l n="6">From rushes green , and brakes , and cowslip 'd lawns ,</l>
     <l n="7">The ever-smitten Hermes empty left</l>
     <l n="8">His golden throne , bent warm on amorous theft :</l>
     <l n="9">From high Olympus had he stolen light ,</l>
     <l n="10">On this side of Jove 's clouds , to escape the sight</l>
     <l n="11">Of his great summoner , and made retreat</l>
     <l n="12">Into a forest on the shores of Crete .</l>
     <l n="13">For somewhere in that sacred island dwelt</l>
     <l n="14">A nymph , to whom all hoofed Satyrs knelt ;</l>
     <l n="15">At whose white feet the languid Tritons poured</l>
     <l n="16">Pearls , while on land they wither 'd and adored .</l>
     <l n="17">Fast by the springs where she to bathe was wont ,</l>
     <l n="18">And in those meads where sometime she might haunt ,</l>
     <l n="19">Were strewn rich gifts , unknown to any Muse ,</l>
     <l n="20">Though Fancy 's casket were unlock 'd to choose .</l>
     <l n="21">Ah , what a world of love was at her feet !</l>
     <l n="22">So Hermes thought , and a celestial heat</l>
     <l n="23">Burnt from his winged heels to either ear ,</l>
     <l n="24">That from a whiteness , as the lily clear ,</l>
     <l n="25">Blush 'd into roses ‘ mid his golden hair ,</l>
     <l n="26">Fallen in jealous curls about his shoulders bare .</l>
     <l n="27">From vale to vale , from wood to wood , he flew ,</l>
     <l n="28">Breathing upon the flowers his passion new ,</l>
     <l n="29">And wound with many a river to its head ,</l>
     <l n="30">To find where this sweet nymph prepar 'd her secret bed :</l>
     <l n="31">In vain ; the sweet nymph might nowhere be found ,</l>
     <l n="32">And so he rested , on the lonely ground ,</l>
     <l n="33">Pensive , and full of painful jealousies</l>
     <l n="34">Of the Wood-Gods , and even the very trees .</l>
     <l n="35">There as he stood , he heard a mournful voice ,</l>
     <l n="36">Such as once heard , in gentle heart , destroys</l>
     <l n="37">All pain but pity : thus the lone voice spake :</l>
     <l n="38">“ When from this wreathed tomb shall I awake !</l>
     <l n="39">When move in a sweet body fit for life ,</l>
     <l n="40">And love , and pleasure , and the ruddy strife</l>
     <l n="41">Of hearts and lips ! Ah , miserable me ! ”</l>
     <l n="42">The God , dove-footed , glided silently</l>
     <l n="43">Round bush and tree , soft-brushing , in his speed ,</l>
     <l n="44">The taller grasses and full-flowering weed ,</l>
     <l n="45">Until he found a palpitating snake ,</l>
     <l n="46">Bright , and cirque-couchant in a dusky brake .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="47">She was a gordian shape of dazzling hue ,</l>
     <l n="48">Vermilion-spotted , golden , green , and blue ;</l>
     <l n="49">Striped like a zebra , freckled like a pard ,</l>
     <l n="50">Eyed like a peacock , and all crimson barr 'd ;</l>
     <l n="51">And full of silver moons , that , as she breathed ,</l>
     <l n="52">Dissolv 'd , or brighter shone , or interwreathed</l>
     <l n="53">Their lustres with the gloomier tapestries —</l>
     <l n="54">So rainbow-sided , touch 'd with miseries ,</l>
     <l n="55">She seem 'd , at once , some penanced lady elf ,</l>
     <l n="56">Some demon 's mistress , or the demon 's self .</l>
     <l n="57">Upon her crest she wore a wannish fire</l>
     <l n="58">Sprinkled with stars , like Ariadne 's tiar :</l>
     <l n="59">Her head was serpent , but ah , bitter-sweet !</l>
     <l n="60">She had a woman 's mouth with all its pearls complete :</l>
     <l n="61">And for her eyes : what could such eyes do there</l>
     <l n="62">But weep , and weep , that they were born so fair ?</l>
     <l n="63">As Proserpine still weeps for her Sicilian air .</l>
     <l n="64">Her throat was serpent , but the words she spake</l>
     <l n="65">Came , as through bubbling honey , for Love 's sake ,</l>
     <l n="66">And thus ; while Hermes on his pinions lay ,</l>
     <l n="67">Like a stoop 'd falcon ere he takes his prey .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="68">“ Fair Hermes , crown 'd with feathers , fluttering light ,</l>
     <l n="69">I had a splendid dream of thee last night :</l>
     <l n="70">I saw thee sitting , on a throne of gold ,</l>
     <l n="71">Among the Gods , upon Olympus old ,</l>
     <l n="72">The only sad one ; for thou didst not hear</l>
     <l n="73">The soft , lute-finger 'd Muses chaunting clear ,</l>
     <l n="74">Nor even Apollo when he sang alone ,</l>
     <l n="75">Deaf to his throbbing throat 's long , long melodious moan .</l>
     <l n="76">I dreamt I saw thee , robed in purple flakes ,</l>
     <l n="77">Break amorous through the clouds , as morning breaks ,</l>
     <l n="78">And , swiftly as a bright Phoebean dart ,</l>
     <l n="79">Strike for the Cretan isle ; and here thou art !</l>
     <l n="80">Too gentle Hermes , hast thou found the maid ? ”</l>
     <l n="81">Whereat the star of Lethe not delay 'd</l>
     <l n="82">His rosy eloquence , and thus inquired :</l>
     <l n="83">“ Thou smooth-lipp 'd serpent , surely high inspired !</l>
     <l n="84">Thou beauteous wreath , with melancholy eyes ,</l>
     <l n="85">Possess whatever bliss thou canst devise ,</l>
     <l n="86">Telling me only where my nymph is fled ,—</l>
     <l n="87">Where she doth breathe ! ” “ Bright planet , thou hast said , ”</l>
     <l n="88">Return 'd the snake , “ but seal with oaths , fair God ! ”</l>
     <l n="89">“ I swear , ” said Hermes , “ by my serpent rod ,</l>
     <l n="90">And by thine eyes , and by thy starry crown ! ”</l>
     <l n="91">Light flew his earnest words , among the blossoms blown .</l>
     <l n="92">Then thus again the brilliance feminine :</l>
     <l n="93">“ Too frail of heart ! for this lost nymph of thine ,</l>
     <l n="94">Free as the air , invisibly , she strays</l>
     <l n="95">About these thornless wilds ; her pleasant days</l>
     <l n="96">She tastes unseen ; unseen her nimble feet</l>
     <l n="97">Leave traces in the grass and flowers sweet ;</l>
     <l n="98">From weary tendrils , and bow 'd branches green ,</l>
     <l n="99">She plucks the fruit unseen , she bathes unseen :</l>
     <l n="100">And by my power is her beauty veil 'd</l>
     <l n="101">To keep it unaffronted , unassail 'd</l>
     <l n="102">By the love-glances of unlovely eyes ,</l>
     <l n="103">Of Satyrs , Fauns , and blear 'd Silenus ’ sighs .</l>
     <l n="104">Pale grew her immortality , for woe</l>
     <l n="105">Of all these lovers , and she grieved so</l>
     <l n="106">I took compassion on her , bade her steep</l>
     <l n="107">Her hair in weird syrops , that would keep</l>
     <l n="108">Her loveliness invisible , yet free</l>
     <l n="109">To wander as she loves , in liberty .</l>
     <l n="110">Thou shalt behold her , Hermes , thou alone ,</l>
     <l n="111">If thou wilt , as thou swearest , grant my boon ! ”</l>
     <l n="112">Then , once again , the charmed God began</l>
     <l n="113">An oath , and through the serpent 's ears it ran</l>
     <l n="114">Warm , tremulous , devout , psalterian .</l>
     <l n="115">Ravish 'd , she lifted her Circean head ,</l>
     <l n="116">Blush 'd a live damask , and swift-lisping said ,</l>
     <l n="117">“ I was a woman , let me have once more</l>
     <l n="118">A woman 's shape , and charming as before .</l>
     <l n="119">I love a youth of Corinth — O the bliss !</l>
     <l n="120">Give me my woman 's form , and place me where he is .</l>
     <l n="121">Stoop , Hermes , let me breathe upon thy brow ,</l>
     <l n="122">And thou shalt see thy sweet nymph even now . ”</l>
     <l n="123">The God on half-shut feathers sank serene ,</l>
     <l n="124">She breath 'd upon his eyes , and swift was seen</l>
     <l n="125">Of both the guarded nymph near-smiling on the green .</l>
     <l n="126">It was no dream ; or say a dream it was ,</l>
     <l n="127">Real are the dreams of Gods , and smoothly pass</l>
     <l n="128">Their pleasures in a long immortal dream .</l>
     <l n="129">One warm , flush 'd moment , hovering , it might seem</l>
     <l n="130">Dash 'd by the wood-nymph 's beauty , so he burn 'd ;</l>
     <l n="131">Then , lighting on the printless verdure , turn 'd</l>
     <l n="132">To the swoon 'd serpent , and with languid arm ,</l>
     <l n="133">Delicate , put to proof the lythe Caducean charm .</l>
     <l n="134">So done , upon the nymph his eyes he bent ,</l>
     <l n="135">Full of adoring tears and blandishment ,</l>
     <l n="136">And towards her stept : she , like a moon in wane ,</l>
     <l n="137">Faded before him , cower 'd , nor could restrain</l>
     <l n="138">Her fearful sobs , self-folding like a flower</l>
     <l n="139">That faints into itself at evening hour :</l>
     <l n="140">But the God fostering her chilled hand ,</l>
     <l n="141">She felt the warmth , her eyelids open 'd bland ,</l>
     <l n="142">And , like new flowers at morning song of bees ,</l>
     <l n="143">Bloom 'd , and gave up her honey to the lees .</l>
     <l n="144">Into the green-recessed woods they flew ;</l>
     <l n="145">Nor grew they pale , as mortal lovers do .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="146">Left to herself , the serpent now began</l>
     <l n="147">To change ; her elfin blood in madness ran ,</l>
     <l n="148">Her mouth foam 'd , and the grass , therewith besprent ,</l>
     <l n="149">Wither 'd at dew so sweet and virulent ;</l>
     <l n="150">Her eyes in torture fix 'd , and anguish drear ,</l>
     <l n="151">Hot , glaz 'd , and wide , with lid-lashes all sear ,</l>
     <l n="152">Flash 'd phosphor and sharp sparks , without one cooling tear .</l>
     <l n="153">The colours all inflam 'd throughout her train ,</l>
     <l n="154">She writh 'd about , convuls 'd with scarlet pain :</l>
     <l n="155">A deep volcanian yellow took the place</l>
     <l n="156">Of all her milder-mooned body 's grace ;</l>
     <l n="157">And , as the lava ravishes the mead ,</l>
     <l n="158">Spoilt all her silver mail , and golden brede ;</l>
     <l n="159">Made gloom of all her frecklings , streaks and bars ,</l>
     <l n="160">Eclips 'd her crescents , and lick 'd up her stars :</l>
     <l n="161">So that , in moments few , she was undrest</l>
     <l n="162">Of all her sapphires , greens , and amethyst ,</l>
     <l n="163">And rubious-argent : of all these bereft ,</l>
     <l n="164">Nothing but pain and ugliness were left .</l>
     <l n="165">Still shone her crown ; that vanish 'd , also she</l>
     <l n="166">Melted and disappear 'd as suddenly ;</l>
     <l n="167">And in the air , her new voice luting soft ,</l>
     <l n="168">Cried , “ Lycius ! gentle Lycius ! ” — Borne aloft</l>
     <l n="169">With the bright mists about the mountains hoar</l>
     <l n="170">These words dissolv 'd : Crete 's forests heard no more .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="171">Whither fled Lamia , now a lady bright ,</l>
     <l n="172">A full-born beauty new and exquisite ?</l>
     <l n="173">She fled into that valley they pass o'er</l>
     <l n="174">Who go to Corinth from Cenchreas ’ shore ;</l>
     <l n="175">And rested at the foot of those wild hills ,</l>
     <l n="176">The rugged founts of the Peraean rills ,</l>
     <l n="177">And of that other ridge whose barren back</l>
     <l n="178">Stretches , with all its mist and cloudy rack ,</l>
     <l n="179">South-westward to Cleone . There she stood</l>
     <l n="180">About a young bird 's flutter from a wood ,</l>
     <l n="181">Fair , on a sloping green of mossy tread ,</l>
     <l n="182">By a clear pool , wherein she passioned</l>
     <l n="183">To see herself escap 'd from so sore ills ,</l>
     <l n="184">While her robes flaunted with the daffodils .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="185">Ah , happy Lycius !— for she was a maid</l>
     <l n="186">More beautiful than ever twisted braid ,</l>
     <l n="187">Or sigh 'd , or blush 'd , or on spring-flowered lea</l>
     <l n="188">Spread a green kirtle to the minstrelsy :</l>
     <l n="189">A virgin purest lipp 'd , yet in the lore</l>
     <l n="190">Of love deep learned to the red heart 's core :</l>
     <l n="191">Not one hour old , yet of sciential brain</l>
     <l n="192">To unperplex bliss from its neighbour pain ;</l>
     <l n="193">Define their pettish limits , and estrange</l>
     <l n="194">Their points of contact , and swift counterchange ;</l>
     <l n="195">Intrigue with the specious chaos , and dispart</l>
     <l n="196">Its most ambiguous atoms with sure art ;</l>
     <l n="197">As though in Cupid 's college she had spent</l>
     <l n="198">Sweet days a lovely graduate , still unshent ,</l>
     <l n="199">And kept his rosy terms in idle languishment .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="200">Why this fair creature chose so fairily</l>
     <l n="201">By the wayside to linger , we shall see ;</l>
     <l n="202">But first ‘ tis fit to tell how she could muse</l>
     <l n="203">And dream , when in the serpent prison-house ,</l>
     <l n="204">Of all she list , strange or magnificent :</l>
     <l n="205">How , ever , where she will 'd , her spirit went ;</l>
     <l n="206">Whether to faint Elysium , or where</l>
     <l n="207">Down through tress-lifting waves the Nereids fair</l>
     <l n="208">Wind into Thetis ’ bower by many a pearly stair ;</l>
     <l n="209">Or where God Bacchus drains his cups divine ,</l>
     <l n="210">Stretch 'd out , at ease , beneath a glutinous pine ;</l>
     <l n="211">Or where in Pluto 's gardens palatine</l>
     <l n="212">Mulciber 's columns gleam in far piazzian line .</l>
     <l n="213">And sometimes into cities she would send</l>
     <l n="214">Her dream , with feast and rioting to blend ;</l>
     <l n="215">And once , while among mortals dreaming thus ,</l>
     <l n="216">She saw the young Corinthian Lycius</l>
     <l n="217">Charioting foremost in the envious race ,</l>
     <l n="218">Like a young Jove with calm uneager face ,</l>
     <l n="219">And fell into a swooning love of him .</l>
     <l n="220">Now on the moth-time of that evening dim</l>
     <l n="221">He would return that way , as well she knew ,</l>
     <l n="222">To Corinth from the shore ; for freshly blew</l>
     <l n="223">The eastern soft wind , and his galley now</l>
     <l n="224">Grated the quaystones with her brazen prow</l>
     <l n="225">In port Cenchreas , from Egina isle</l>
     <l n="226">Fresh anchor 'd ; whither he had been awhile</l>
     <l n="227">To sacrifice to Jove , whose temple there</l>
     <l n="228">Waits with high marble doors for blood and incense rare .</l>
     <l n="229">Jove heard his vows , and better 'd his desire ;</l>
     <l n="230">For by some freakful chance he made retire</l>
     <l n="231">From his companions , and set forth to walk ,</l>
     <l n="232">Perhaps grown wearied of their Corinth talk :</l>
     <l n="233">Over the solitary hills he fared ,</l>
     <l n="234">Thoughtless at first , but ere eve 's star appeared</l>
     <l n="235">His phantasy was lost , where reason fades ,</l>
     <l n="236">In the calm 'd twilight of Platonic shades .</l>
     <l n="237">Lamia beheld him coming , near , more near —</l>
     <l n="238">Close to her passing , in indifference drear ,</l>
     <l n="239">His silent sandals swept the mossy green ;</l>
     <l n="240">So neighbour 'd to him , and yet so unseen</l>
     <l n="241">She stood : he pass 'd , shut up in mysteries ,</l>
     <l n="242">His mind wrapp 'd like his mantle , while her eyes</l>
     <l n="243">Follow 'd his steps , and her neck regal white</l>
     <l n="244">Turn 'd — syllabling thus , “ Ah , Lycius bright ,</l>
     <l n="245">And will you leave me on the hills alone ?</l>
     <l n="246">Lycius , look back ! and be some pity shown . ”</l>
     <l n="247">He did ; not with cold wonder fearingly ,</l>
     <l n="248">But Orpheus-like at an Eurydice ;</l>
     <l n="249">For so delicious were the words she sung ,</l>
     <l n="250">It seem 'd he had lov 'd them a whole summer long :</l>
     <l n="251">And soon his eyes had drunk her beauty up ,</l>
     <l n="252">Leaving no drop in the bewildering cup ,</l>
     <l n="253">And still the cup was full ,— while he afraid</l>
     <l n="254">Lest she should vanish ere his lip had paid</l>
     <l n="255">Due adoration , thus began to adore ;</l>
     <l n="256">Her soft look growing coy , she saw his chain so sure :</l>
     <l n="257">“ Leave thee alone ! Look back ! Ah , Goddess , see</l>
     <l n="258">Whether my eyes can ever turn from thee !</l>
     <l n="259">For pity do not this sad heart belie —</l>
     <l n="260">Even as thou vanishest so I shall die .</l>
     <l n="261">Stay ! though a Naiad of the rivers , stay !</l>
     <l n="262">To thy far wishes will thy streams obey :</l>
     <l n="263">Stay ! though the greenest woods be thy domain ,</l>
     <l n="264">Alone they can drink up the morning rain :</l>
     <l n="265">Though a descended Pleiad , will not one</l>
     <l n="266">Of thine harmonious sisters keep in tune</l>
     <l n="267">Thy spheres , and as thy silver proxy shine ?</l>
     <l n="268">So sweetly to these ravish 'd ears of mine</l>
     <l n="269">Came thy sweet greeting , that if thou shouldst fade</l>
     <l n="270">Thy memory will waste me to a shade —</l>
     <l n="271">For pity do not melt ! ” — “ If I should stay , ”</l>
     <l n="272">Said Lamia , “ here , upon this floor of clay ,</l>
     <l n="273">And pain my steps upon these flowers too rough ,</l>
     <l n="274">What canst thou say or do of charm enough</l>
     <l n="275">To dull the nice remembrance of my home ?</l>
     <l n="276">Thou canst not ask me with thee here to roam</l>
     <l n="277">Over these hills and vales , where no joy is ,—</l>
     <l n="278">Empty of immortality and bliss !</l>
     <l n="279">Thou art a scholar , Lycius , and must know</l>
     <l n="280">That finer spirits cannot breathe below</l>
     <l n="281">In human climes , and live : Alas ! poor youth ,</l>
     <l n="282">What taste of purer air hast thou to soothe</l>
     <l n="283">My essence ? What serener palaces ,</l>
     <l n="284">Where I may all my many senses please ,</l>
     <l n="285">And by mysterious sleights a hundred thirsts appease ?</l>
     <l n="286">It cannot be — Adieu ! ” So said , she rose</l>
     <l n="287">Tiptoe with white arms spread . He , sick to lose</l>
     <l n="288">The amorous promise of her lone complain ,</l>
     <l n="289">Swoon 'd , murmuring of love , and pale with pain .</l>
     <l n="290">The cruel lady , without any show</l>
     <l n="291">Of sorrow for her tender favourite 's woe ,</l>
     <l n="292">But rather , if her eyes could brighter be ,</l>
     <l n="293">With brighter eyes and slow amenity ,</l>
     <l n="294">Put her new lips to his , and gave afresh</l>
     <l n="295">The life she had so tangled in her mesh :</l>
     <l n="296">And as he from one trance was wakening</l>
     <l n="297">Into another , she began to sing ,</l>
     <l n="298">Happy in beauty , life , and love , and every thing ,</l>
     <l n="299">A song of love , too sweet for earthly lyres ,</l>
     <l n="300">While , like held breath , the stars drew in their panting fires</l>
     <l n="301">And then she whisper 'd in such trembling tone ,</l>
     <l n="302">As those who , safe together met alone</l>
     <l n="303">For the first time through many anguish 'd days ,</l>
     <l n="304">Use other speech than looks ; bidding him raise</l>
     <l n="305">His drooping head , and clear his soul of doubt ,</l>
     <l n="306">For that she was a woman , and without</l>
     <l n="307">Any more subtle fluid in her veins</l>
     <l n="308">Than throbbing blood , and that the self-same pains</l>
     <l n="309">Inhabited her frail-strung heart as his .</l>
     <l n="310">And next she wonder 'd how his eyes could miss</l>
     <l n="311">Her face so long in Corinth , where , she said ,</l>
     <l n="312">She dwelt but half retir 'd , and there had led</l>
     <l n="313">Days happy as the gold coin could invent</l>
     <l n="314">Without the aid of love ; yet in content</l>
     <l n="315">Till she saw him , as once she pass 'd him by ,</l>
     <l n="316">Where ‘ gainst a column he leant thoughtfully</l>
     <l n="317">At Venus ’ temple porch , ‘ mid baskets heap 'd</l>
     <l n="318">Of amorous herbs and flowers , newly reap 'd</l>
     <l n="319">Late on that eve , as ‘ twas the night before</l>
     <l n="320">The Adonian feast ; whereof she saw no more ,</l>
     <l n="321">But wept alone those days , for why should she adore ?</l>
     <l n="322">Lycius from death awoke into amaze ,</l>
     <l n="323">To see her still , and singing so sweet lays ;</l>
     <l n="324">Then from amaze into delight he fell</l>
     <l n="325">To hear her whisper woman 's lore so well ;</l>
     <l n="326">And every word she spake entic 'd him on</l>
     <l n="327">To unperplex 'd delight and pleasure known .</l>
     <l n="328">Let the mad poets say whate'er they please</l>
     <l n="329">Of the sweets of Fairies , Peris , Goddesses ,</l>
     <l n="330">There is not such a treat among them all ,</l>
     <l n="331">Haunters of cavern , lake , and waterfall ,</l>
     <l n="332">As a real woman , lineal indeed</l>
     <l n="333">From Pyrrha 's pebbles or old Adam 's seed .</l>
     <l n="334">Thus gentle Lamia judg 'd , and judg 'd aright ,</l>
     <l n="335">That Lycius could not love in half a fright ,</l>
     <l n="336">So threw the goddess off , and won his heart</l>
     <l n="337">More pleasantly by playing woman 's part ,</l>
     <l n="338">With no more awe than what her beauty gave ,</l>
     <l n="339">That , while it smote , still guaranteed to save .</l>
     <l n="340">Lycius to all made eloquent reply ,</l>
     <l n="341">Marrying to every word a twinborn sigh ;</l>
     <l n="342">And last , pointing to Corinth , ask 'd her sweet ,</l>
     <l n="343">If ‘ twas too far that night for her soft feet .</l>
     <l n="344">The way was short , for Lamia 's eagerness</l>
     <l n="345">Made , by a spell , the triple league decrease</l>
     <l n="346">To a few paces ; not at all surmised</l>
     <l n="347">By blinded Lycius , so in her comprized .</l>
     <l n="348">They pass 'd the city gates , he knew not how</l>

     <l n="401">Love in a palace is perhaps at last</l>
     <l n="402">More grievous torment than a hermit 's fast —</l>
     <l n="403">That is a doubtful tale from faery land ,</l>
     <l n="404">Hard for the non-elect to understand .</l>
     <l n="405">Had Lycius liv 'd to hand his story down ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="414">For all this came a ruin : side by side</l>
     <l n="415">They were enthroned , in the even tide ,</l>
     <l n="416">Upon a couch , near to a curtaining</l>
     <l n="417">Whose airy texture , from a golden string ,</l>
     <l n="418">Floated into the room , and let appear</l>
     <l n="419">Unveil 'd the summer heaven , blue and clear ,</l>
     <l n="420">Betwixt two marble shafts :— there they reposed ,</l>
     <l n="421">Where use had made it sweet , with eyelids closed ,</l>
     <l n="422">Saving a tythe which love still open kept ,</l>
     <l n="423">That they might see each other while they almost slept ;</l>
     <l n="424">When from the slope side of a suburb hill ,</l>
     <l n="425">Deafening the swallow 's twitter , came a thrill</l>
     <l n="426">Of trumpets — Lycius started — the sounds fled ,</l>
     <l n="427">But left a thought , a buzzing in his head .</l>
     <l n="428">For the first time , since first he harbour 'd in</l>
     <l n="429">That purple-lined palace of sweet sin ,</l>
     <l n="430">His spirit pass 'd beyond its golden bourn</l>
     <l n="431">Into the noisy world almost forsworn .</l>
     <l n="432">The lady , ever watchful , penetrant ,</l>
     <l n="433">Saw this with pain , so arguing a want</l>
     <l n="434">Of something more , more than her empery</l>
     <l n="435">Of joys ; and she began to moan and sigh</l>
     <l n="436">Because he mused beyond her , knowing well</l>
     <l n="437">That but a moment 's thought is passion 's passing bell .</l>
     <l n="438">“ Why do you sigh , fair creature ? ” whisper 'd he :</l>
     <l n="439">“ Why do you think ? ” return 'd she tenderly :</l>
     <l n="440">“ You have deserted me — where am I now ?</l>
     <l n="441">Not in your heart while care weighs on your brow :</l>
     <l n="442">No , no , you have dismiss 'd me ; and I go</l>
     <l n="443">From your breast houseless : ay , it must be so . ”</l>
     <l n="444">He answer 'd , bending to her open eyes ,</l>
     <l n="445">Where he was mirror 'd small in paradise ,</l>
     <l n="446">My silver planet , both of eve and morn !</l>
     <l n="447">Why will you plead yourself so sad forlorn ,</l>
     <l n="448">While I am striving how to fill my heart</l>
     <l n="449">With deeper crimson , and a double smart ?</l>
     <l n="450">How to entangle , trammel up and snare</l>
     <l n="451">Your soul in mine , and labyrinth you there</l>
     <l n="452">Like the hid scent in an unbudded rose ?</l>
     <l n="453">Ay , a sweet kiss — you see your mighty woes .</l>
     <l n="454">My thoughts ! shall I unveil them ? Listen then !</l>
     <l n="455">What mortal hath a prize , that other men</l>
     <l n="456">May be confounded and abash 'd withal ,</l>
     <l n="457">But lets it sometimes pace abroad majestical ,</l>
     <l n="458">And triumph , as in thee I should rejoice</l>
     <l n="459">Amid the hoarse alarm of Corinth 's voice .</l>
     <l n="460">“ Let my foes choke , and my friends shout afar ,</l>
     <l n="461">While through the thronged streets your bridal car</l>
     <l n="462">Wheels round its dazzling spokes . ” The lady 's cheek</l>
     <l n="463">Trembled ; she nothing said , but , pale and meek ,</l>
     <l n="464">Arose and knelt before him , wept a rain</l>
     <l n="465">Of sorrows at his words ; at last with pain</l>
     <l n="466">Beseeching him , the while his hand she wrung ,</l>
     <l n="467">To change his purpose . He thereat was stung ,</l>
     <l n="468">Perverse , with stronger fancy to reclaim</l>
     <l n="469">Her wild and timid nature to his aim :</l>
     <l n="470">Besides , for all his love , in self despite ,</l>
     <l n="471">Against his better self , he took delight</l>
     <l n="472">Luxurious in her sorrows , soft and new .</l>
     <l n="473">His passion , cruel grown , took on a hue</l>
     <l n="474">Fierce and sanguineous as ‘ twas possible</l>
     <l n="475">In one whose brow had no dark veins to swell .</l>
     <l n="476">Fine was the mitigated fury , like</l>
     <l n="477">Apollo 's presence when in act to strike</l>
     <l n="478">The serpent — Ha , the serpent ! certes , she</l>
     <l n="479">Was none . She burnt , she lov 'd the tyranny ,</l>
     <l n="480">And , all subdued , consented to the hour</l>
     <l n="481">When to the bridal he should lead his paramour .</l>
     <l n="482">Whispering in midnight silence , said the youth ,</l>
     <l n="483">“ Sure some sweet name thou hast , though , by my truth ,</l>
     <l n="484">I have not ask 'd it , ever thinking thee</l>
     <l n="485">Not mortal , but of heavenly progeny ,</l>
     <l n="486">As still I do . Hast any mortal name ,</l>
     <l n="487">Fit appellation for this dazzling frame ?</l>

     <l n="637">By her glad Lycius sitting , in chief place ,</l>
     <l n="638">Scarce saw in all the room another face ,</l>
     <l n="639">Till , checking his love trance , a cup he took</l>
     <l n="640">Full brimm 'd , and opposite sent forth a look</l>
     <l n="641">‘ Cross the broad table , to beseech a glance</l>
     <l n="642">From his old teacher 's wrinkled countenance ,</l>
     <l n="643">And pledge him . The bald-head philosopher</l>
     <l n="644">Had fix 'd his eye , without a twinkle or stir</l>
     <l n="645">Full on the alarmed beauty of the bride ,</l>
     <l n="646">Brow-beating her fair form , and troubling her sweet pride .</l>
     <l n="647">Lycius then press 'd her hand , with devout touch ,</l>
     <l n="648">As pale it lay upon the rosy couch :</l>
     <l n="649">‘ Twas icy , and the cold ran through his veins ;</l>
     <l n="650">Then sudden it grew hot , and all the pains</l>
     <l n="651">Of an unnatural heat shot to his heart .</l>
     <l n="652">“ Lamia , what means this ? Wherefore dost thou start ?</l>
     <l n="653">Know'st thou that man ? ” Poor Lamia answer 'd not .</l>
     <l n="654">He gaz 'd into her eyes , and not a jot</l>
     <l n="655">Own 'd they the lovelorn piteous appeal :</l>
     <l n="656">More , more he gaz 'd : his human senses reel :</l>
     <l n="657">Some hungry spell that loveliness absorbs ;</l>
     <l n="658">There was no recognition in those orbs .</l>
     <l n="659">“ Lamia ! ” he cried — and no soft-toned reply .</l>
     <l n="660">The many heard , and the loud revelry</l>
     <l n="661">Grew hush ; the stately music no more breathes ;</l>
     <l n="662">The myrtle sicken 'd in a thousand wreaths .</l>
     <l n="663">By faint degrees , voice , lute , and pleasure ceased ;</l>
     <l n="664">A deadly silence step by step increased ,</l>
     <l n="665">Until it seem 'd a horrid presence there ,</l>
     <l n="666">And not a man but felt the terror in his hair .</l>
     <l n="667">“ Lamia ! ” he shriek 'd ; and nothing but the shriek</l>
     <l n="668">With its sad echo did the silence break .</l>
     <l n="669">“ Begone , foul dream ! ” he cried , gazing again</l>
     <l n="670">In the bride 's face , where now no azure vein</l>
     <l n="671">Wander 'd on fair-spaced temples ; no soft bloom</l>
     <l n="672">Misted the cheek ; no passion to illume</l>
     <l n="673">The deep-recessed vision — all was blight ;</l>
     <l n="674">Lamia , no longer fair , there sat a deadly white .</l>
     <l n="675">“ Shut , shut those juggling eyes , thou ruthless man !</l>
     <l n="676">Turn them aside , wretch ! or the righteous ban</l>
     <l n="677">Of all the Gods , whose dreadful images</l>
     <l n="678">Here represent their shadowy presences ,</l>
     <l n="679">May pierce them on the sudden with the thorn</l>
     <l n="680">Of painful blindness ; leaving thee forlorn ,</l>
     <l n="681">In trembling dotage to the feeblest fright</l>
     <l n="682">Of conscience , for their long offended might ,</l>
     <l n="683">For all thine impious proud-heart sophistries ,</l>
     <l n="684">Unlawful magic , and enticing lies .</l>
     <l n="685">Corinthians ! look upon that gray-beard wretch !</l>
     <l n="686">Mark how , possess 'd , his lashless eyelids stretch</l>
     <l n="687">Around his demon eyes ! Corinthians , see !</l>
     <l n="688">My sweet bride withers at their potency . ”</l>
     <l n="689">“ Fool ! ” said the sophist , in an under-tone</l>
     <l n="690">Gruff with contempt ; which a death-nighing moan</l>
     <l n="691">From Lycius answer 'd , as heart-struck and lost ,</l>
     <l n="692">He sank supine beside the aching ghost .</l>
     <l n="693">“ Fool ! Fool ! ” repeated he , while his eyes still</l>
     <l n="694">Relented not , nor mov 'd ; “ from every ill</l>
     <l n="695">Of life have I preserv 'd thee to this day ,</l>
     <l n="696">And shall I see thee made a serpent 's prey ? ”</l>
     <l n="697">Then Lamia breath 'd death breath ; the sophist 's eye ,</l>
     <l n="698">Like a sharp spear , went through her utterly ,</l>
     <l n="699">Keen , cruel , perceant , stinging : she , as well</l>
     <l n="700">As her weak hand could any meaning tell ,</l>
     <l n="701">Motion 'd him to be silent ; vainly so ,</l>
     <l n="702">He look 'd and look 'd again a level — No !</l>
     <l n="703">“ A Serpent ! ” echoed he ; no sooner said ,</l>
     <l n="704">Than with a frightful scream she vanished :</l>
     <l n="705">And Lycius ’ arms were empty of delight ,</l>
     <l n="706">As were his limbs of life , from that same night .</l>
     <l n="707">On the high couch he lay !— his friends came round</l>
     <l n="708">Supported him — no pulse , or breath they found ,</l>
     <l n="709">And , in its marriage robe , the heavy body wound .</l>
