    <docDate><date>1814</date>. Oh could my Mind , unfolded in my page , Enlighten climes and mould a future age ; There as it glow 'd , with noblest frenzy fraught , Dispense the treasures of exalted thought ; To Virtue wake the pulses of the heart , And bid the tear of emulation start ! Oh could it still , thro ’ each succeeding year , My life , my manners , and my name endear ; And , when the poet sleeps in silent dust , Still hold communion with the wise and just !— Yet should this Verse , my leisure 's best resource , When thro ’ the world it steals its secret course , Revive but once a generous wish supprest , Chase but a sigh , or charm a care to rest ; In one good deed a fleeting hour employ , Or flush one faded cheek with honest joy ; Blest were my lines , tho ’ limited their sphere , Tho ’ short their date , as his who trac 'd them here .</docDate>

     <p>THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY PART I</p>
     <p>Dolce sentier ....... Colle , che mi piacesti ,.... Ov ’ ancor per usanza Amor mi mena ; Ben riconosco in voi l'usate forme , Non , lasso , in me . PETRARCH</p>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART .</head>
      <head>THE Poem begins with the description of an obscure village , and of the pleasing melancholy which it excites on being revisited after a long absence . This mixed sensation is an effect of the Memory . From an effect we naturally ascend to the cause ; and the subject proposed is then unfolded with an investigation of the nature and leading principles of this faculty .</head>
       <l n="1">It is evident that our ideas flow in continual succession , and</l>
       <l n="2">introduce each other with a certain degree of regularity .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>They are sometimes excited by sensible objects , and sometimes by an internal operation of the mind . Of the former species is most probably the memory of brutes ; and its many sources of pleasure to them , as well as to us , are considered in the first part . The latter is the most perfect degree of memory , and forms the subject of the second .</p>
     <p>When ideas have any relation whatever , they are attractive of each other in the mind ; and the perception of any object naturally leads to the idea of another , which was connected with it either in time or place , or which can be compared or contrasted with it . Hence arises our attachment to inanimate objects ; hence also , in some degree , the love of our country , and the emotion with which we contemplate the celebrated scenes of antiquity . Hence a picture directs our thoughts to the original : and , as cold and darkness suggest forcibly the ideas of heat and light , he , who feels the infirmities of age , dwells most on whatever reminds him of the vigour and vivacity of his youth .</p>
     <p>The associating principle , as here employed , is no less conducive to virtue than to happiness ; and , as such , it frequently discovers itself in the most tumultuous scenes of life . It addresses our finer feelings , and gives exercise to every mild and generous propensity .</p>
     <p>Not confined to man , it extends through all animated nature ; and its effects are peculiarly striking in the domestic tribes .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Twilight 's soft dews steal o'er the village-green ,</l>
       <l n="2">With magic tints to harmonize the scene .</l>
       <l n="3">Still 'd is the hum that thro ’ the hamlet broke ,</l>
       <l n="4">When round the ruins of their antient oak</l>
       <l n="5">The peasants flock 'd to hear the minstrel play ,</l>
       <l n="6">And games and carols clos 'd the busy day .</l>
       <l n="7">Her wheel at rest , the matron thrills no more</l>
       <l n="8">With treasur 'd tales , and legendary lore .</l>
       <l n="9">All , all are fled ; nor mirth nor music flows</l>
       <l n="10">To chase the dreams of innocent repose .</l>
       <l n="11">All , all are fled ; yet still I linger here !</l>
       <l n="12">What secret charms this silent spot endear ?</l>
       <l n="13">Mark yon old Mansion frowning thro ’ the trees .</l>
       <l n="14">Whose hollow turret wooes the whistling breeze .</l>
       <l n="15">That casement , arch 'd with ivy 's brownest shade ,</l>
       <l n="16">First to these eyes the light of heav'n convey 'd .</l>
       <l n="17">The mouldering gateway strews the grass-grown court ,</l>
       <l n="18">Once the calm scene of many a simple sport ;</l>
       <l n="19">When nature pleas 'd , for life itself was new ,</l>
       <l n="20">And the heart promis 'd what the fancy drew .</l>
       <l n="21">See , thro ’ the fractur 'd pediment reveal 'd ,</l>
       <l n="22">Where moss inlays the rudely-sculptur 'd shield ,</l>
       <l n="23">The martin 's old , hereditary nest .</l>
       <l n="24">Long may the ruin spare its hallow 'd guest !</l>
       <l n="25">As jars the hinge , what sullen echoes call !</l>
       <l n="26">Oh haste , unfold the hospitable hall !</l>
       <l n="27">That hall , where once , in antiquated state ,</l>
       <l n="28">The chair of justice held the grave debate .</l>
       <l n="29">Now stain 'd with dews , with cobwebs darkly hung ,</l>
       <l n="30">Oft has its roof with peals of rapture rung ;</l>
       <l n="31">When round yon ample board , in due degree ,</l>
       <l n="32">We sweeten 'd every meal with social glee .</l>
       <l n="33">The heart 's light laugh pursued the circling jest ;</l>
       <l n="34">And all was sunshine in each little breast .</l>
       <l n="35">‘ Twas here we chas 'd the slipper by the sound ;</l>
       <l n="36">And turn 'd the blindfold hero round and round .</l>
       <l n="37">‘ Twas here , at eve , we form 'd our fairy ring ;</l>
       <l n="38">And Fancy flutter 'd on her wildest wing .</l>
       <l n="39">Giants and genii chain 'd each wondering ear ;</l>
       <l n="40">And orphan-sorrows drew the ready tear .</l>
       <l n="41">Oft with the babes we wander 'd in the wood ,</l>
       <l n="42">Or view 'd the forest-feats of Robin Hood :</l>
       <l n="43">Oft , fancy-led , at midnight 's fearful hour ,</l>
       <l n="44">With startling step we seal 'd the lonely tower :</l>
       <l n="45">O'er infant innocence to hang and weep ,</l>
       <l n="46">Murder 'd by ruffian hands , when smiling in its sleep .</l>
       <l n="47">Ye Household Deities ! whose guardian eye</l>
       <l n="48">Mark 'd each pure thought , ere register 'd on high ;</l>
       <l n="49">Still , still ye walk the consecrated ground ,</l>
       <l n="50">And breathe the soul of Inspiration round .</l>
       <l n="51">As o'er the dusky furniture I bend ,</l>
       <l n="52">Each chair awakes the feelings of a friend .</l>
       <l n="53">The storied arras , source of fond delight ,</l>
       <l n="54">With old achievement charms the wilder 'd sight ;</l>
       <l n="55">And still , with Heraldry 's rich hues imprest ,</l>
       <l n="56">On the dim window glows the pictur 'd crest .</l>
       <l n="57">The screen unfolds its many-colour 'd chart .</l>
       <l n="58">The clock still points its moral to the heart .</l>
       <l n="59">That faithful monitor ‘ twas heav'n to hear !</l>
       <l n="60">When soft it spoke a promis 'd pleasure near :</l>
       <l n="61">And has its sober hand , its simple chime ,</l>
       <l n="62">Forgot to trace the feather 'd feet of Time ?</l>
       <l n="63">That massive beam , with curious carvings wrought ,</l>
       <l n="64">Whence the caged linnet sooth 'd my pensive thought ;</l>
       <l n="65">Those muskets , cas 'd with venerable rust ;</l>
       <l n="66">Those once-lov 'd forms , still breathing thro ’ their dust ,</l>
       <l n="67">Still from the frame , in mould gigantic cast ,</l>
       <l n="68">Starting to life — all whisper of the past !</l>
       <l n="69">As thro ’ the garden 's desert paths I rove ,</l>
       <l n="70">What fond illusions swarm in every grove !</l>
       <l n="71">How oft , when purple evening ting 'd the west ,</l>
       <l n="72">We watch 'd the emmet to her grainy nest ;</l>
       <l n="73">Welcom 'd the wild-bee home on weary wing ,</l>
       <l n="74">Laden with sweets , the choicest of the spring !</l>
       <l n="75">How oft inscrib 'd , with ‘ Friendship 's votive rhyme ,</l>
       <l n="76">The bark now silver 'd by the touch of Time ;</l>
       <l n="77">Soar 'd in the swing , half pleas 'd and half afraid ,</l>
       <l n="78">Thro ’ sister elms that wav 'd their summer-shade ;</l>
       <l n="79">Or strew 'd with crumbs yon root-inwoven seat ,</l>
       <l n="80">To lure the redbreast from his lone retreat !</l>
       <l n="81">Childhood 's lov 'd group revisits every scene ;</l>
       <l n="82">The tangled wood-walk , and the tufted green !</l>
       <l n="83">Indulgent MEMORY wakes , and lo , they live !</l>
       <l n="84">Cloth 'd with far softer hues than Light can give .</l>
       <l n="85">Thou first , best friend that Heav'n assigns below ,</l>
       <l n="86">To sooth and sweeten all the cares we know ;</l>
       <l n="87">Whose glad suggestions still each vain alarm ,</l>
       <l n="88">When nature fades , and life forgets to charm ;</l>
       <l n="89">Thee would the Muse invoke !— to thee belong</l>
       <l n="90">The sage 's precept , and the poet 's song .</l>
       <l n="91">What soften 'd views thy magic glass reveals ,</l>
       <l n="92">When o'er the landscape Time 's meek twilight steals !</l>
       <l n="93">As when in ocean sinks the orb of day ,</l>
       <l n="94">Long on the wave reflected lustres play ;</l>
       <l n="95">Thy temper 'd gleams of happiness resign 'd</l>
       <l n="96">Glance on the darken 'd mirror of the mind .</l>
       <l n="97">The School 's lone porch , with reverend mosses gray ,</l>
       <l n="98">Just tells the pensive pilgrim where it lay .</l>
       <l n="99">Mute is the bell that rung at peep of dawn ,</l>
       <l n="100">Quickening my truant-feet across the lawn :</l>
       <l n="101">Unheard the shout that rent the noontide air ,</l>
       <l n="102">When the slow dial gave a pause to care .</l>
       <l n="103">Up springs , at every step , to claim a tear , [ a ]</l>
       <l n="104">Some little friendship form 'd and cherish 'd here !</l>
       <l n="105">And not the lightest leaf , but trembling teems</l>
       <l n="106">With golden visions , and romantic dreams !</l>
       <l n="107">Down by yon hazel copse , at evening , blaz 'd</l>
       <l n="108">The Gipsy 's faggot — there we stood and gaz 'd ;</l>
       <l n="109">Gaz 'd on her sun-burnt face with silent awe ,</l>
       <l n="110">Her tatter 'd mantle , and her hood of straw ;</l>
       <l n="111">Her moving lips , her caldron brimming o'er ;</l>
       <l n="112">The drowsy brood that on her back she bore ,</l>
       <l n="113">Imps , in the barn with mousing owlet bred ,</l>
       <l n="114">From rifled roost at nightly revel fed ;</l>
       <l n="115">Whose dark eyes flash 'd thro ’ locks of blackest shade ,</l>
       <l n="116">When in the breeze the distant watch-dog bay 'd :—</l>
       <l n="117">And heroes fled the Sibyl 's mutter 'd call ,</l>
       <l n="118">Whose elfin prowess scal 'd the orchard-wall .</l>
       <l n="119">As o'er my palm the silver piece she drew ,</l>
       <l n="120">And trac 'd the line of life with searching view ,</l>
       <l n="121">How throbb 'd my fluttering pulse with hopes and fears ,</l>
       <l n="122">To learn the colour of my future years !</l>
       <l n="123">Ah , then , what honest triumph flush 'd my breast !</l>
       <l n="124">This truth once known — To bless is to be blest !</l>
       <l n="125">We led the bending beggar on his way ,</l>
       <l n="126">( Bare were his feet , his tresses silver-gray )</l>
       <l n="127">Sooth 'd the keen pangs his aged spirit felt ,</l>
       <l n="128">And on his tale with mute attention dwelt .</l>
       <l n="129">As in his scrip we dropt our little store ,</l>
       <l n="130">And wept to think that little was no more ,</l>
       <l n="131">He breath 'd his prayer , “ Long may such goodness live ! ”</l>
       <l n="132">‘ Twas all he gave , ‘ twas all he had to give .</l>
       <l n="133">Angels , when Mercy 's mandate wing 'd their flight ,</l>
       <l n="134">Had stopt to catch new rapture from the sight .</l>
       <l n="135">But hark ! thro ’ those old firs , with sullen swell</l>
       <l n="136">The church-clock strikes ! ye tender scenes , farewell !</l>
       <l n="137">It calls me hence , beneath their shade , to trace</l>
       <l n="138">The few fond lines that Time may soon efface .</l>
       <l n="139">On yon gray stone , that fronts the chancel-door .</l>
       <l n="140">Worn smooth by busy feet now seen no more ,</l>
       <l n="141">Each eve we shot the marble thro ’ the ring ,</l>
       <l n="142">When the heart danc 'd , and life was in its spring ;</l>
       <l n="143">Alas ! unconscious of the kindred earth ,</l>
       <l n="144">That faintly echoed to the voice of mirth .</l>
       <l n="145">The glow-worm loves her emerald light to shed ,</l>
       <l n="146">Where now the sexton rests his hoary head .</l>
       <l n="147">Oft , as he turn 'd the greensward with his spade ,</l>
       <l n="148">He lectur 'd every youth that round him play 'd ;</l>
       <l n="149">And , calmly pointing where his fathers lay ,</l>
       <l n="150">Rous 'd him to rival each , the hero of his day .</l>
       <l n="151">Hush , ye fond flutterings , hush ! while here alone</l>
       <l n="152">I search the records of each mouldering stone .</l>
       <l n="153">Guides of my life ! Instructors of my youth !</l>
       <l n="154">Who first unveil 'd the hallow 'd form of Truth ;</l>
       <l n="155">Whose every word enlighten 'd and endear 'd ;</l>
       <l n="156">In age belov 'd , in poverty rever 'd ;</l>
       <l n="157">In Friendship 's silent register ye live ,</l>
       <l n="158">Nor ask the vain memorial Art can give .</l>
       <l n="159">— But when the sons of peace and pleasure sleep ,</l>
       <l n="160">When only Sorrow wakes , and wakes to weep ,</l>
       <l n="161">What spells entrance my visionary mind ,</l>
       <l n="162">With sighs so sweet , with transports so refin 'd ?</l>
       <l n="163">Ethereal Power ! whose smile , at noon of night ,</l>
       <l n="164">Recalls the far-fled spirit of delight ;</l>
       <l n="165">Instils that musing , melancholy mood ,</l>
       <l n="166">Which charms the wise , and elevates the good ;</l>
       <l n="167">Blest MEMORY , hail ! Oh grant the grateful Muse ,</l>
       <l n="168">Her pencil dipt in Nature 's living hues ,</l>
       <l n="169">To pass the clouds that round thy empire roll ,</l>
       <l n="170">And trace its airy precincts in the soul .</l>
       <l n="171">Lull 'd in the countless chambers of the brain ,</l>
       <l n="172">Our thoughts are link 'd by many a hidden chain .</l>
       <l n="173">Awake but one , and lo , what myriads rise ! [ b ]</l>
       <l n="174">Each stamps its image as the other flies !</l>
       <l n="175">Each , as the various avenues of sense</l>
       <l n="176">Delight or sorrow to the soul dispense ,</l>
       <l n="177">Brightens or fades ; yet all , with magic art ,</l>
       <l n="178">Controul the latent fibres of the heart .</l>
       <l n="179">As studious PROSPERO 'S mysterious spell</l>
       <l n="180">Conven 'd the subject-spirits to his cell ;</l>
       <l n="181">Each , at thy call , advances or retires ,</l>
       <l n="182">As judgment dictates , or the scene inspires .</l>
       <l n="183">Each thrills the seat of sense , that sacred source</l>
       <l n="184">Whence the fine nerves direct their mazy course ,</l>
       <l n="185">And thro ’ the frame invisibly convey</l>
       <l n="186">The subtle , quick vibrations as they play .</l>
       <l n="187">Survey the globe , each ruder realm explore ;</l>
       <l n="188">From Reason 's faintest ray to NEWTON soar ,</l>
       <l n="189">What different spheres to human bliss assign 'd !</l>
       <l n="190">What slow gradations in the scale of mind !</l>
       <l n="191">Yet mark in each these mystic wonders wrought ;</l>
       <l n="192">Oh mark the sleepless energies of thought !</l>
       <l n="193">The adventurous boy , that asks his little share ,</l>
       <l n="194">And hies from home with many a gossip 's prayer ,</l>
       <l n="195">Turns on the neighbouring hill , once more to see</l>
       <l n="196">The dear abode of peace and privacy ;</l>
       <l n="197">And as he turns , the thatch among the trees ,</l>
       <l n="198">The smoke 's blue wreaths ascending with the breeze ,</l>
       <l n="199">The village-common spotted white with sheep ,</l>
       <l n="200">The church-yard yews round which his fathers sleep ; [ c ]</l>
       <l n="201">All rouse Reflection 's sadly-pleasing train .</l>
       <l n="202">And oft he looks and weeps , and looks again .</l>
       <l n="203">So , when the mild TUPIA dar 'd explore</l>
       <l n="204">Arts yet untaught , and worlds unknown before ,</l>
       <l n="205">And , with the sons of Science , woo 'd the gale</l>
       <l n="206">That , rising , swell 'd their strange expanse of sail ;</l>
       <l n="207">So , when he breath 'd his firm yet fond adieu , [ d ]</l>
       <l n="208">Borne from his leafy hut , his carv 'd canoe ,</l>
       <l n="209">And all his soul best lov 'd — such tears he shed ,</l>
       <l n="210">While each soft scene of summer-beauty fled :</l>
       <l n="211">Long o'er the wave a wistful look he cast ,</l>
       <l n="212">Long watch 'd the streaming signal from the mast ;</l>
       <l n="213">Till twilight 's dewy tints deceiv 'd his eye ,</l>
       <l n="214">And fairy forests fring 'd the evening sky .</l>
       <l n="215">So Scotia 's Queen , as slowly dawn 'd the day , ’ [ d ]</l>
       <l n="216">Rose on her couch , and gaz 'd her soul away .</l>
       <l n="217">Her eyes had bless 'd the beacon 's glimmering height ,</l>
       <l n="218">That faintly tipt the feathery surge with light ;</l>
       <l n="219">But now the morn with orient hues pourtray 'd</l>
       <l n="220">Each castled cliff , and brown monastic shade :</l>
       <l n="221">All touch 'd the talisman 's resistless spring ,</l>
       <l n="222">And lo , what busy tribes were instant on the wing !</l>
       <l n="223">Thus kindred objects kindred thoughts inspire ,</l>
       <l n="224">As summer-clouds flash forth electric fire . [ f ]</l>
       <l n="225">And hence this spot gives back the joys of youth ,</l>
       <l n="226">Warm as the life , and with the mirror 's truth .</l>
       <l n="227">Hence home-felt pleasure prompts the Patriot 's sigh ; [ g ]</l>
       <l n="228">This makes him wish to live , and dare to die .</l>
       <l n="229">For this young FOSCAKI , whose hapless fate [ h ]</l>
       <l n="230">Venice should blush to hear the Muse relate ,</l>
       <l n="231">When exile wore his blooming years away ,</l>
       <l n="232">To sorrow 's long soliloquies a prey ,</l>
       <l n="233">When reason , justice , vainly urg 'd his cause ,</l>
       <l n="234">For this he rous 'd her sanguinary laws ;</l>
       <l n="235">Glad to return , tho ’ Hope could grant no more ,</l>
       <l n="236">And chains and torture hail 'd him to the shore .</l>
       <l n="237">And hence the charm historic scenes impart :</l>
       <l n="238">Hence Tiber awes , and Avon melts the heart .</l>
       <l n="239">Aerial forms , in Tempe 's classic vale ,</l>
       <l n="240">Glance thro ’ the gloom , and whisper in the gale ;</l>
       <l n="241">In wild Vaucluse with love and LAURA dwell ,</l>
       <l n="242">And watch and weep in ELOISA 'S cell . ’ [ i ]</l>
       <l n="243">‘ Twas ever thus . As now at VIRGIL 'S tomb , [ k ]</l>
       <l n="244">We bless the shade , and bid the verdure bloom :</l>
       <l n="245">So TULLY paus 'd , amid the wrecks of Time , [ l ]</l>
       <l n="246">On the rude stone to trace the truth sublime ;</l>
       <l n="247">When at his feet , in honour 'd dust disclos 'd ,</l>
       <l n="248">The immortal Sage of Syracuse repos 'd .</l>
       <l n="249">And as his youth in sweet delusion hung ,</l>
       <l n="250">Where once a PLATO taught , a PINDAR sung ;</l>
       <l n="251">Who now but meets him musing , when he roves</l>
       <l n="252">His ruin 'd Tusculan 's romantic groves ?</l>
       <l n="253">In Rome 's great forum , who but hears him roll</l>
       <l n="254">His moral thunders o'er the subject soul ?</l>
       <l n="255">And hence that calm delight the portrait gives :</l>
       <l n="256">We gaze on every feature till it lives !</l>
       <l n="257">Still the fond lover views the absent maid ;</l>
       <l n="258">And the lost friend still lingers in his shade !</l>
       <l n="259">Say why the pensive widow loves to weep , [ m ]</l>
       <l n="260">When on her knee she rocks her babe to sleep :</l>
       <l n="261">Tremblingly still , she lifts his veil to trace</l>
       <l n="262">The father 's features in his infant face .</l>
       <l n="263">The hoary grandsire smiles the hour away ,</l>
       <l n="264">Won by the charm of Innocence at play ;</l>
       <l n="265">He bends to meet each artless burst of joy ,</l>
       <l n="266">Forgets his age , and acts again the boy .</l>
       <l n="267">What tho ’ the iron school of War erase</l>
       <l n="268">Each milder virtue , and each softer grace ;</l>
       <l n="269">What tho ’ the fiend 's torpedo-touch arrest</l>
       <l n="270">Each gentler , finer impulse of the breast ;</l>
       <l n="271">Still shall this active principle preside ,</l>
       <l n="272">And wake the tear to Pity 's self denied .</l>
       <l n="273">The intrepid Swiss , that guards a foreign shore ,</l>
       <l n="274">Condemn 'd to climb his mountain-cliffs no more ,</l>
       <l n="275">If chance he hears the song so sweetly wild [ n ]</l>
       <l n="276">Which on those cliffs his infant hours beguil 'd ,</l>
       <l n="277">Melts at the long-lost scenes that round him rise ,</l>
       <l n="278">And sinks a martyr to repentant sighs .</l>
       <l n="279">Ask not if courts or camps dissolve the charm :</l>
       <l n="280">Say why VESPASIAN lov 'd his Sabine farm ; [ o ]</l>
       <l n="281">Why great NAVARRE , when France and freedom bled , [ p ]</l>

       <l n="286">In calm Salona 's philosophic shade .</l>
       <l n="287">Say , when contentious CHARLES renounc 'd a throne , [ r ]</l>
       <l n="288">To muse with monks unletter 'd and unknown ,</l>
       <l n="289">What from his soul the parting tribute drew ?</l>
       <l n="290">What claim 'd the sorrows of a last adieu ?</l>
       <l n="291">The still retreats that sooth 'd his tranquil breast ,</l>
       <l n="292">Ere grandeur dazzled , and its cares oppress 'd .</l>
       <l n="293">Undamp 'd by time , the generous Instinct glows</l>
       <l n="294">Far as Angola 's sands , as Zembla 's snows ;</l>
       <l n="295">Glows in the tiger 's den , the serpent 's nest ,</l>
       <l n="296">On every form of varied life imprest .</l>
       <l n="297">The social tribes its choicest influence hail :—</l>
       <l n="298">And , when the drum beats briskly in the gale ,</l>
       <l n="299">The war-worn courser charges at the sound ,</l>
       <l n="300">And with young vigour wheels the pasture round .</l>
       <l n="301">Oft has the aged tenant of the vale</l>
       <l n="302">Lean 'd on his staff to lengthen out the tale ;</l>
       <l n="303">Oft have his lips the grateful tribute breath 'd ,</l>
       <l n="304">From sire to son with pious zeal bequeath 'd .</l>
       <l n="305">When o'er the blasted heath the day declin 'd ,</l>
       <l n="306">And on the scath 'd oak warr 'd the winter-wind ;</l>
       <l n="307">When not a distant taper 's twinkling ray</l>
       <l n="308">Gleam 'd o'er the furze to light him on his way ;</l>
       <l n="309">When not a sheep-bell sooth 'd his listening ear ,</l>
       <l n="310">And the big rain-drops told the tempest near ;</l>
       <l n="311">Then did his horse the homeward track descry , [ s ]</l>
       <l n="312">The track that shunn 'd his sad , inquiring eye ;</l>
       <l n="313">And win each wavering purpose to relent ,</l>
       <l n="314">With warmth so mild , so gently violent ,</l>
       <l n="315">That his charm 'd hand the careless rein resign 'd ,</l>
       <l n="316">And doubts and terrors vanish 'd from his mind .</l>
       <l n="317">Recall the traveller , whose alter 'd form</l>
       <l n="318">Has borne the buffet of the mountain-storm ;</l>
       <l n="319">And who will first his fond impatience meet ?</l>
       <l n="320">His faithful dog 's already at his feet !</l>
       <l n="321">Yes , tho ’ the porter spurn him from the door ,</l>
       <l n="322">Tho ’ all , that knew him , know his face no more ,</l>
       <l n="323">His faithful dog shall tell his joy to each ,</l>
       <l n="324">With that mute eloquence which passes speech .—</l>
       <l n="325">And see , the master but returns to die !</l>
       <l n="326">Yet who shall bid the watchful servant fly ?</l>
       <l n="327">The blasts of heav'n , the drenching dews of earth ,</l>
       <l n="328">The wanton insults of unfeeling mirth ,</l>
       <l n="329">These , when to guard Misfortune 's sacred grave ,</l>

       <l n="335">Pile rocks on rocks , bid woods and mountains rise ,</l>
       <l n="336">Eclipse her native shades , her native skies ;—</l>
       <l n="337">‘ Tis vain ! thro ’ Ether 's pathless wilds she goes ,</l>

       <l n="342">With looks that ask 'd , yet dar 'd not hope relief ,</l>
       <l n="343">Want , with her babes , round generous Valour clung ,</l>
       <l n="344">To wring the slow surrender from his tongue ,</l>
       <l n="345">‘ Twas thine to animate her closing eye ;</l>
       <l n="346">Alas ! ‘ twas thine perchance the first to die ,</l>
       <l n="347">Crush 'd by her meagre hand , when welcom 'd from the sky .</l>
       <l n="348">Hark ! the bee winds her small but mellow horn , [ u ]</l>
       <l n="349">Blithe to salute the sunny smile of morn .</l>
       <l n="350">O'er thymy downs she bends her busy course ,</l>
       <l n="351">And many a stream allures her to its source .</l>
       <l n="352">‘ Tis noon , ‘ tis night . That eye so finely wrought ,</l>
       <l n="353">Beyond the search of sense , the soar of thought .</l>
       <l n="354">Now vainly asks the scenes she left behind ;</l>
       <l n="355">Its orb so full , its vision so confin 'd !</l>
       <l n="356">Who guides the patient pilgrim to her cell ?</l>
       <l n="357">Who bids her soul with conscious triumph swell ?</l>
       <l n="358">With conscious truth retrace the mazy clue</l>
       <l n="359">Of varied scents , that charm 'd her as she flew ?</l>
       <l n="360">Hail , MEMORY , hail ! thy universal reign</l>
       <l n="361">Guards the least link of Being 's glorious chain .</l>

      <head>THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY</head>
      <lg type="part" n="1">
       <head>PART II .</head>
        <l n="1">Delle cose custode , e dispensiera .</l>
        <l n="2">TASSO .</l>

     <p>ANALYSIS OF THE SECOND PART .</p>
     <p>The Memory has hitherto acted only in subservience to the senses , and so far man is not eminently distinguished from other animals : but , with respect to man , she has a higher province ; and is often busily employed , when excited by no external cause whatever . She preserves , for his use , the treasures of art and science , history and philosophy . She colours all the prospects of life : for ‘ we can only anticipate the future , by concluding what is possible from what is past . ’ On her agency depends every effusion of the Fancy , whose boldest effort can only compound or transpose , augment or diminish the materials which she has collected and retained .</p>
     <p>When the first emotions of despair have subsided , and sorrow has softened into melancholy , she amuses with a retrospect of innocent pleasures , and inspires that noble confidence which results from the consciousness of having acted well . When sleep has suspended the organs of sense from their office , she not only supplies the mind with images , but assists in their combination . And even in madness itself , when the soul is resigned over to the tyranny of a distempered imagination , she revives past perceptions , and awakens the train of thought which was formerly most familiar .</p>
     <p>Nor are we pleased only with a review of the brighter passages of life . Events , the most distressing in their immediate consequences , are often cherished in remembrance with a degree of enthusiasm .</p>
     <p>But the world and its occupations give a mechanical impulse to the passions , which is not very favourable to the indulgence of this feeling . It is in a calm and well-regulated mind that the Memory is most perfect ; and solitude is her best sphere of action . With this sentiment is introduced a Tale , illustrative of her influence in solitude , sickness , and , sorrow . And the subject having now been considered , so far as it relates to man and the animal world , the Poem concludes with a conjecture , that superior beings are blest with a nobler exercise of this faculty .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Sweet MEMORY , wafted by thy gentle gale ,</l>
       <l n="2">Oft up the stream of Time I turn my sail ,</l>
       <l n="3">To view the fairy-haunts of long-lost hours .</l>
       <l n="4">Blest with far greener shades , far fresher flowers .</l>
       <l n="5">Ages and climes remote to Thee impart</l>
       <l n="6">What charms in Genius , and refines in Art ;</l>
       <l n="7">Thee , in whose hand the keys of Science dwell ,</l>
       <l n="8">The pensive portress of her holy cell ;</l>
       <l n="9">Whose constant vigils chase the chilling damp</l>
       <l n="10">Oblivion steals upon her vestal-lamp .</l>
       <l n="11">The friends of Reason , and the guides of Youth ,</l>
       <l n="12">Whose language breath 'd the eloquence of Truth ;</l>
       <l n="13">Whose life , beyond preceptive wisdom , taught</l>
       <l n="14">The great in conduct , and the pure in thought ;</l>
       <l n="15">These still exist , by Thee to Fame consign 'd , [ x ]</l>
       <l n="16">Still speak and act , the models of mankind .</l>
       <l n="17">From Thee sweet Hope her airy colouring draws ;</l>
       <l n="18">And Fancy 's flights are subject to thy laws .</l>
       <l n="19">From Thee that bosom-spring of rapture flows ,</l>
       <l n="20">Which only Virtue , tranquil Virtue , knows .</l>
       <l n="21">When Joy 's bright sun has shed his evening ray ,</l>
       <l n="22">And Hope 's delusive meteors cease to play ;</l>
       <l n="23">When clouds on clouds the smiling prospect close ,</l>
       <l n="24">Still thro ’ the gloom thy star serenely glows ;</l>
       <l n="25">Like yon fair orb , she gilds the brow of night</l>
       <l n="26">With the mild magic of reflected light .</l>
       <l n="27">The beauteous maid , that bids the world adieu ,</l>
       <l n="28">Oft of that world will snatch a fond review ;</l>
       <l n="29">Oft at the shrine neglect her beads ,</l>
       <l n="30">to trace Some social scene , some dear , familiar face ,</l>
       <l n="31">Forgot , when first a father 's stern controul</l>
       <l n="32">Chas 'd the gay visions of her opening soul :</l>
       <l n="33">And ere , with iron tongue , the vesper-bell</l>
       <l n="34">Bursts thro ’ the cypress-walk , the convent-cell ,</l>
       <l n="35">Oft will her warm and wayward heart revive ,</l>
       <l n="36">To love and joy still tremblingly alive ;</l>
       <l n="37">The whisper 'd vow , the chaste caress prolong ,</l>
       <l n="38">Weave the light dance and swell the choral song ;</l>
       <l n="39">With rapt ear drink the enchanting serenade ,</l>
       <l n="40">And , as it melts along the moonlight-glade ,</l>
       <l n="41">To each soft note return as soft a sigh ,</l>
       <l n="42">And bless the youth that bids her slumbers fly .</l>
       <l n="43">But not till Time has calm 'd the ruffled breast ,</l>
       <l n="44">Are these fond dreams of happiness confest .</l>
       <l n="45">Not till the rushing winds forget to rave ,</l>
       <l n="46">Is Heav'n ' s sweet smile reflected on the wave .</l>
       <l n="47">From Guinea 's coast pursue the lessening sail ,</l>
       <l n="48">And catch the sounds that sadden every gale .</l>
       <l n="49">Tell , if thou canst , the sum of sorrows there ;</l>
       <l n="50">Mark the fixt gaze , the wild and frenzied glare ,</l>
       <l n="51">The racks of thought , and freezings of despair !</l>
       <l n="52">But pause not then — beyond the western wave ,</l>
       <l n="53">Go , view the captive barter 'd as a slave !</l>
       <l n="54">Crush 'd till his high , heroic spirit bleeds ,</l>
       <l n="55">And from his nerveless frame indignantly recedes .</l>
       <l n="56">Yet here , ev'n here , with pleasures long resign 'd ,</l>
       <l n="57">Lo ! MEMORY bursts the twilight of the mind :</l>
       <l n="58">Her dear delusions sooth his sinking soul ,</l>
       <l n="59">When the rude scourge presumes its base controul ;</l>
       <l n="60">And o'er Futurity 's blank page diffuse</l>
       <l n="61">The full reflection of her vivid hues .</l>
       <l n="62">‘ Tis but to die , and then , to weep no more ,</l>
       <l n="63">Then will he wake on Congo 's distant shore ;</l>
       <l n="64">Beneath his plantain 's antient shade , renew</l>
       <l n="65">The simple transports that with freedom flew ;</l>
       <l n="66">Catch the cool breeze that musky Evening blows ,</l>
       <l n="67">And quaff the palm 's rich nectar as it glows ;</l>
       <l n="68">The oral tale of elder time rehearse ,</l>
       <l n="69">And chant the rude , traditionary verse ;</l>
       <l n="70">With those , the lov 'd companions of his youth ,</l>
       <l n="71">When life was luxury , and friendship truth .</l>
       <l n="72">Ah ! why should Virtue fear the frowns of Fate ?</l>
       <l n="73">Hers what no wealth can win , no power create !</l>
       <l n="74">A little world of clear and cloudless day ,</l>
       <l n="75">Nor wreck 'd by storms , nor moulder 'd by decay ;</l>
       <l n="76">A world , with MEMORY 'S ceaseless sun-shine blest ,</l>

     <p>There is a future Existence even in this world ; an Existence in the hearts and minus of those who shall live after us . It is in reserve for every man , however obscure ; and his portion , if he be diligent , must be equal to his desires . For in whose remembrance can we wish to hold a place , but such as know , and are known by us ? These are within the sphere of our influence , and among these and their descendants we may live evermore .</p>
     <p>It is a state of rewards and punishments ; and , like that revealed to us in the Gospel , has the happiest influence on our lives . The latter excites us to gain the favour of GOD ; the former to gain the love and esteem of wise and good men ; and both lead to the same end ; for , in framing our conceptions of the DEITY , we only ascribe to Him exalted degrees of Wisdom and Goodness .</p>

      <head>AN EPISTLE TO A FRIEND .</head>
       <l n="1">Villula ,.......... et pauper agelle ,</l>
       <l n="2">Me tibi , et hos unâ mecum , et quos semper amavi ,</l>
       <l n="3">Commendo .</l>

     <p>PREFACE .</p>
     <p>Every reader turns with pleasure to those passages of Horace , and Pope , and Boileau , which describe how they lived and where they dwelt ; and which , being interspersed among their satirical writings , derive a secret and irresistible grace from the contrast , and are admirable examples of what in Painting is termed repose .</p>
     <p>We have admittance to Horace at all hours . We enjoy the company and conversation at his table ; and his suppers , like Plato 's , ‘ non solum in præsentia , sed etiam postero die jucundæ sunt . ’ But when we look round as we sit there , we find ourselves in a Sabine farm , and not in a Roman villa . His windows have every charm of prospect ; but his furniture might have descended from Cincin-natus ; and gems , and pictures , and old marbles , are mentioned by him more than once with a seeming indifference .</p>
     <p>His English Imitator thought and felt , perhaps , more correctly on the subject ; and embellished his garden and grotto with great industry and success . But to these alone he solicits our notice . On the ornaments of his house he is silent ; and he appears to have reserved all the minuter touches of his pencil for the library , the chapel , and the banquetting-room of Timon . ‘ Le savoir de notre siècle , ’ says Rousseau , ‘ tend beaucoup plus à détruire qu'à edifier . On censure d'un ton de maitre ; pour proposer , il en faut prendre un autre . ’</p>
     <p>It is the design of this Epistle to illustrate the virtue of True Taste ; and to shew how little she requires to secure , not only the comforts , but even the elegancies of life . True Taste is an excellent Economist . She confines her choice to few objects , and delights in producing great effects by small means : while False Taste is for ever sighing after the new and the rare ; and reminds us , in her works , of the Scholar of Apelles , who , not being able to paint his Helen beautiful , determined to make her fine .</p>

       <l n="1">When , with a REAUMUR 'S skill , thy curious mind</l>
       <l n="2">Has class 'd the insect-tribes of human-kind ,</l>
       <l n="3">Each with its busy hum , or gilded wing ,</l>
       <l n="4">Its subtle , web-work , or its venom 'd sting ;</l>
       <l n="5">Let me , to claim a few unvalued hours ,</l>
       <l n="6">Point the green lane that leads thro ’ fern and flowers ;</l>
       <l n="7">The shelter 'd gate that opens to my field ,</l>
       <l n="8">And the white front thro ’ mingling elms reveal 'd .</l>
       <l n="9">In vain , alas , a village-friend invites</l>
       <l n="10">To simple comforts , and domestic rites ,</l>
       <l n="11">When the gay months of Carnival resume</l>
       <l n="12">Their annual round of glitter and perfume ;</l>
       <l n="13">When London hails thee to its splendid mart ,</l>
       <l n="14">Its hives of sweets , and cabinets of art ;</l>
       <l n="15">And , lo , majestic as thy manly song ,</l>
       <l n="16">Flows the full tide of human life along .</l>
       <l n="17">Still must my partial pencil love to dwell</l>
       <l n="18">On the home-prospects of my hermit cell ;</l>
       <l n="19">The mossy pales that skirt the orchard-green ,</l>
       <l n="20">Here hid by shrub-wood , there by glimpses seen ;</l>
       <l n="21">And the brown pathway , that , with careless flow ,</l>
       <l n="22">Sinks , and is lost among the trees below .</l>
       <l n="23">Still must it trace ( the flattering tints forgive )</l>
       <l n="24">Each fleeting charm that bids the landscape live .</l>
       <l n="25">Oft o'er the mead , at pleasing distance , pass [ a ]</l>
       <l n="26">Browsing the hedge by fits the pannier 'd ass ;</l>
       <l n="27">The idling shepherd-boy , with rude delight ,</l>
       <l n="28">Whistling his dog to mark the pebble 's flight ;</l>
       <l n="29">And in her kerchief blue the cottage-maid ,</l>
       <l n="30">With brimming pitcher from the shadowy glade .</l>
       <l n="31">Far to the south a mountain-vale retires ,</l>
       <l n="32">Rich in its groves , and glens , and village-spires ;</l>
       <l n="33">Its upland lawns , and cliffs with foliage hung ,</l>
       <l n="34">Its wizard-stream , nor nameless nor unsung :</l>
       <l n="35">And thro ’ the various year , the various day , [ b ]</l>
       <l n="36">What scenes of glory burst , and melt away !</l>
       <l n="37">When April-verdure springs in Grosvenor-square ,</l>
       <l n="38">And the furr 'd Beauty comes to winter there ,</l>
       <l n="39">She bids old Nature mar the plan no more ;</l>
       <l n="40">Yet still the seasons circle as before .</l>
       <l n="41">Ah , still as soon the young Aurora plays ,</l>
       <l n="42">Tho ’ moons and flambeaux trail their broadest blaze ;</l>
       <l n="43">As soon the sky-lark pours his matin song ,</l>
       <l n="44">Tho ’ Evening lingers at the mask so long .</l>
       <l n="45">There let her strike with momentary ray ,</l>
       <l n="46">As tapers shine their little lives away ;</l>
       <l n="47">There let her practise from herself to steal ,</l>
       <l n="48">And look the happiness she does not feel ;</l>
       <l n="49">The ready smile and bidden blush employ</l>
       <l n="50">At Faro-routs that dazzle to destroy ;</l>
       <l n="51">Fan with affected ease the essenc 'd air ,</l>
       <l n="52">And lisp of fashions with unmeaning stare .</l>
       <l n="53">Be thine to meditate an humbler flight ,</l>
       <l n="54">When morning fills the fields with rosy light ;</l>
       <l n="55">Be thine to blend , nor thine a vulgar aim ,</l>
       <l n="56">Repose with dignity , with Quiet fame .</l>
       <l n="57">Here no state-chambers in long line unfold ,</l>
       <l n="58">Bright with broad mirrors , rough with fretted gold ;</l>
       <l n="59">Yet modest ornament , with use combin 'd ,</l>
       <l n="60">Attracts the eye to exercise the mind .</l>

     <p>Cosmo of Medicis took most pleasure in his Apennine villa , because all that he commanded from its windows was exclusively his own .

     <p>When Socrates was asked why he had built for himself so small a house , “ Small as it is , ” he replied , “ I wish I could fill it with friends . ” PHÆDRUS , 1. iii . 9 .</p>
     <p>These indeed are all that a wise man would desire to assemble ; “ for a crowd is not company , and faces are but a gallery of pictures , and talk but a tinkling cymbal , where there is no love . ” BACON 'S Essays , xxvii .</p>

     <p>It is remarkable that Antony , in his adversity , passed some time in a small but splendid retreat , which he called his Timonium , and from which might originate the idea of the Parisian Boudoir , that favourite apartment , ou I'on se retire pour étre seul , mais ou l'on ne boude point .

     <p>The dining-room is dedicated to Conviviality ; or , as Cicero somewhere expresses it , “ Communitati vitæ atque victûs . ” There we wish most for the society of our friends ; and , perhaps , in their absence , most require their portraits .</p>
     <p>The moral advantages of this furniture may be illustrated by the pretty story of an Athenian courtezan , “ who , in the midst of a riotous banquet with her lovers , accidentally cast her eye on the portrait of a philosopher , that hung opposite to her seat : the happy character of temperance and virtue struck her with so lively an image of her own unworthiness , that she instantly quitted the room ; and , retiring home , became ever after an example of temperance , as she had been before of debauchery . ”</p>

     <p>Cicero speaks with pleasure of a little seat under Aristotle in the library of Atticus . “ Literis sustentor et recreor ; maloque in illa tua sedecula , quam habes sub imagine Aristotelis , sedere , quàm in istorum sella curuli ! ” Ep . ad Att . iv . 10 .</p>
     <p>Nor should we forget that Dryden drew inspiration from the “ majestic face ” of Shakespeare ; and that a portrait of Newton was the only ornament of the closet of Buffon . Ep . to Kneller . Voyage à Montbart .</p>

     <p>At the petits soupés of Choisy were first introduced those admirable pieces of mechanism , afterwards carried to perfection by Loriot , the Confidente and the Servante ; a table and a side-board , which descended , and rose again covered with viands and wines . And thus the most luxurious Court in Europe , after all its boasted refinements , was glad to return at last , by this singular contrivance , to the quiet and privacy of humble life .

       <l n="21">She moulds her manners to the part she , fills ,</l>
       <l n="22">As Instinct teaches , or as Humour wills ;</l>
       <l n="23">And , as the grave or gay her talent calls ,</l>
       <l n="24">Acts in the drama , till the curtain falls .</l>
       <l n="25">First , how her little breast with triumph swells ,</l>
       <l n="26">When the red coral rings its golden bells !</l>
       <l n="27">To play in pantomime is then the rage ,</l>

       <l n="30">Now here , now there — in noise and mischief ever !</l>
       <l n="31">A school-girl next , she curls her hair in papers ,</l>

       <l n="43">Too soon a flirt , approach her and she flies !</l>

       <l n="45">Plays with unhappy men as cats with mice ;</l>
       <l n="46">Till fading beauty hints the late advice .</l>
       <l n="47">Her prudence dictates what her pride disdain 'd ,</l>
       <l n="48">And now she sues to slaves herself had chain 'd !</l>
       <l n="49">Then comes that good old character , a Wife ,</l>
       <l n="50">With all the dear , distracting cares of life ;</l>
       <l n="51">A thousand cards a day at doors to leave ,</l>
       <l n="52">And , in return , a thousand cards receive ;</l>
       <l n="53">Rouge high , play deep , to lead the ton aspire ,</l>
       <l n="54">With nightly blaze set PORTLAND-PLACE on fire ;</l>
       <l n="55">Snatch half a glimpse at Concert , Opera , Ball ,</l>
       <l n="56">A Meteor , trac 'd by none , tho ’ seen by all ;</l>
       <l n="57">And , when her shatter 'd nerves forbid to roam ,</l>
       <l n="58">In very spleen — rehearse the girls at home .</l>
       <l n="59">Last the grey Dowager , in antient flounces ,</l>
       <l n="60">With snuff and spectacles the age denounces ;</l>
       <l n="61">Boasts how the Sires of this degenerate Isle</l>
       <l n="62">Knelt for a look , and duell 'd for a smile .</l>
       <l n="63">The scourge and ridicule of Goth and Vandal ,</l>
       <l n="64">Her tea she sweetens , as she sips , with scandal ;</l>
       <l n="65">With modern Belles eternal warfare wages ,</l>
       <l n="66">Like her own birds that clamour from their cages ;</l>
       <l n="67">And shuffles round to bear her tale to all ,</l>
       <l n="68">Like some old Ruin , ‘ nodding to its fall ! ’</l>
       <l n="69">Thus WOMAN makes her entrance and her exit ;</l>
       <l n="70">Not least an actress , when she least suspects it .</l>
       <l n="71">Yet Nature oft peeps out and mars the plot ,</l>
       <l n="72">Each lesson lost , each poor pretence forgot ;</l>
       <l n="73">Full oft , with energy that scorns controul ,</l>
       <l n="74">At once lights up the features of the soul ;</l>
       <l n="75">Unlocks each thought chain 'd by coward Art ,</l>
       <l n="76">And to full day the latent passions start !</l>
       <l n="77">— And she , whose first , best wish is your applause ,</l>
       <l n="78">Herself exemplifies the truth she draws .</l>
       <l n="79">Born on the stage — thro ’ every shifting scene ,</l>
       <l n="80">Obscure or bright , tempestuous or serene ,</l>
       <l n="81">Still has your smile her trembling spirit fir 'd !</l>
       <l n="82">And can she act , with thoughts like these inspir 'd ?</l>
       <l n="83">Thus from her mind all artifice she flings ,</l>
       <l n="84">All skill , all practice , now unmeaning things !</l>
       <l n="85">To you , uncheck 'd , each genuine feeling flows ;</l>
       <l n="86">For all that life endears — to you she owes .</l>

      <head>THE VOYAGE OF COLUMBUS .</head>
      <head>CHI SE ’ TU , CHE VIENI ——? DA ME STESSO NON VEGNO . DANTE .</head>
      <head>I have seen the day , That I have worn a visor , and could tell A tale ———— SHAKSP .</head>
      <head>PREFACE .</head>
      <head>The following Poem ( or , to speak more properly , what remains of it [ Footnote ]) has here and there a lyrical turn of thought and expression . It is sudden in its transitions , and full of historical allusions ; leaving much to be imagined by the reader .</head>
       <l n="1">The subject is a voyage the most memorable in the annals of mankind .</l>
       <l n="2">Columbus was a person of extraordinary virtue and piety , acting under</l>
       <l n="3">the sense of a divine impulse ; and his achievement the discovery of a</l>
       <l n="4">New World , the inhabitants of which were shut out from the light of</l>
       <l n="5">Revelation , and given up , as they believed , to the dominion of</l>
       <l n="6">malignant spirits .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Many of the incidents will now be thought extravagant ; yet they were once perhaps received with something more than indulgence . It was an age of miracles ; and who can say that among the venerable legends in the library of the Escurial , or the more authentic records which fill the great chamber in the Archivo of Simancas , and which relate entirely to the deep tragedy of America , there are no volumes that mention the marvellous things here described ? Indeed the story , as already told throughout Europe , admits of no heightening . Such was the religious enthusiasm of the early writers , that the Author had only to transfuse it into his verse ; and he appears to have done little more ; though some of the circumstances , which he alludes to as well-known , have long ceased to be so . By using the language of that day , he has called up Columbus ‘ in his habit as he lived ; ’ and the authorities , such as exist , are carefully given by the translator .</p>
<note>Footnote : The Original in the Castilian language , according to the Inscription that fellows , was found among other MSS . in an old religious house near Palos , situated on an island formed by the river Tinto , and dedicated to our Lady of Rábida . The Writer describes himself as having sailed with Columbus ; but his style and manner are evidently of an after-time .</note>     <note xml:id="note_9" place="bottom" n="">The Original in the Castilian language , according to the Inscription that fellows , was found among other MSS . in an old religious house near Palos , situated on an island formed by the river Tinto , and dedicated to our Lady of Rábida .

     <p>THE ARGUMENT .</p>
     <p>Columbus , having wandered from kingdom to kingdom , at length obtains three ships and sets sail on the Atlantic . The compass alters from its antient direction ; the wind becomes constant and unremitting ; night and day he advances , till he is suddenly stopped in his course by a mass of vegetation , extending as far as the eye can reach , and assuming the appearance of a country overwhelmed by the sea . Alarm and despondence on board . He resigns himself to the care of Heaven , and proceeds on his voyage ; while columns of water move along in his path before him .</p>
     <p>Meanwhile the deities of America assemble in council ; and one of the Zemi , the gods of the islanders , announces his approach . “ In vain , ” says he , “ have we guarded the Atlantic for ages . A mortal has baffled our power ; nor will our votaries arm against him . Yours are a sterner race . Hence ; and , while we have recourse to stratagem , do you array the nations round your altars , and prepare for an exterminating war . ” They disperse while he is yet speaking ; and , in the shape of a condor , he directs his flight to the fleet . His journey described . He arrives there . A panic . A mutiny . Columbus restores order ; continues on his voyage ; and lands in a New World . Ceremonies of the first interview . Rites of hospitality . The ghost of Cazziva .</p>
     <p>Two months pass away , and an Angel , appearing in a dream to Columbus , thus addresses him : “ Return to Europe ; though your Adversaries , such is the will of Heaven , shall let loose the hurricane against you . A little while shall they triumph ; insinuating themselves into the hearts of your followers , and making the World , which you came to bless , a scene of blood and slaughter . Yet is there cause for rejoicing . Your work is done . The cross of Christ is planted here ; and , in due time , all things shall be made perfect ! ”</p>

Diaz makes no mention of the interview ; but , relating an occurrence that took place at this time in Palos , says , ‘ that Cortes was now absent at Nuestra Senora de la Rábida . ’ The Convent is within half a league of the town .</p>

     <p>At the destruction of Callao , in 1747 , no more than one of all the inhabitants escaped ; and he , by a providence the most extraordinary . This man was on the fort that overlooked the harbour , going to strike the flag , when he perceived the sea to retire to a considerable distance ; and then , swelling mountain high , it returned with great violence . The people ran from their houses in terror and confusion ; he heard a cry of Miserere rise from all parts of the city ; and immediately all was silent ; the sea had entirely overwhelmed it , and buried it for ever in its bosom : but the same wave that destroyed it , drove a little boat by the place where he stood , into which he threw himself and was saved .

     <p>By the Genoese and the Spaniards he was regarded as a man resolved on ‘ a wild dedication of himself to unpath 'd waters , undream 'd shores ; ’ and the court of Portugal endeavoured to rob him of the glory of his enterprise , by secretly dispatching a vessel in the course which he had pointed out . ‘ Lorsqu'il avail promis un nouvel hémisphère , ’ says Voltaire , ‘ on lui avait soutenu que cet hémisphère ne pouvait exister ; et quand il l'eut découvert , on prétendit qu'il avait été connu depuis long-temps . ’</p>

     <p>I believe that he was chosen for this great service ; and that , because he was to be so truly an apostle , as in effect be proved to be , therefore was his origin obscure ; that therein he might resemble those who were called to make known the name of the Lord from seas and rivers , and not from courts and palaces . And I believe also , that , as in most of his doings he was guarded by some special providence , his very name was not without some mystery : for in it is expressed the wonder he performed ; inasmuch as he conveyed to a new world the grace of the Holy Ghost , &amp; c.

     <p>Balboa immediately concluded it to be the ocean for which Columbus had searched in vain ; and when , at length , after a toilsome march among the mountains , his guides pointed out to him the summit from which it might be seen , he commanded his men to halt , and went up alone .

     <p>How simple were the manners of the early colonists ! The first ripening of any European fruit was distinguished by a family-festival . Garcilasso de la Vega relates how his dear father , the valorous Andres , collected together in his chamber seven or eight gentlemen to share with him three asparaguses , the first that ever grew on the table-land of Cusco . When the operation of dressing them was over ( and it is minutely described ) he distributed the two largest among his friends ; begging that the company would not take it ill , if he reserved the third for himself , as it was a thing from Spain .</p>
     <p>North America became instantly an asylum for the oppressed ; huguenots , and catholics , and sects of every name and country . Such were the first settlers in Carolina and Maryland , Pennsylvania and New England . Nor is South America altogether without a claim to the title . Even now , while I am writing , the antient house of Braganza is on its passage across the Atlantic ,</p>
