     <p>NOTE . It was intended that the whole of Lord Byron 's Poetical Works should be included in six volumes , corresponding to the six volumes of the Letters , and announcements to this effect have been made ; but this has been found to be impracticable . The great mass of new material incorporated in the Introductions , notes , and variants , has already expanded several of the published volumes to a disproportionate size , and Don Juan itself occupies 612 pages . Volume Seven , which will complete the work , will contain Occasional Poems , Epigrams , etc ., a Bibliography more complete than has ever hitherto been published , and an exhaustive Index .</p>

    <head>INTRODUCTION TO DON JUAN</head>
    <p n="7">Byron was a rapid as well as a voluminous writer . His Tales were thrown off at lightning speed , and even his dramas were thought out and worked through with unhesitating energy and rapid achievement . Nevertheless , the composition of his two great poems was all but coextensive with his poetical life . He began the first canto of Childe Harold in the autumn of 1809 , and he did not complete the fourth canto till the spring of 1818 . He began the first canto of Don Juan in the autumn of 1818 , and he was still at work on a seventeenth canto in the spring of 1823 . Both poems were issued in parts , and with long intervals of unequal duration between the parts ; but the same result was brought about by different causes and produced a dissimilar effect . Childe Harold consists of three distinct poems descriptive of three successive travels or journeys in foreign lands . The adventures of the hero are but the pretext for the shifting of the diorama ; whereas in Don Juan the story is continuous , and the scenery is exhibited as a background for the dramatic evolution of the personality of the hero . Childe Harold came out at intervals , because there were periods when the author was stationary ; but the interruptions in the composition and publication of Don Juan were due to the disapproval and discouragement of friends , and the very natural hesitation and procrastination of the publisher . Canto I. was written in September , 1818 ; Canto II . in December-January , 1818-1819 . Both cantos were published on July 15 , 1819 . Cantos III ., IV . were written in the winter of 1819-1820 ; Canto V ., after an interval of nine months , in October-November , 1820 , but the publication of Cantos III ., IV ., V. was delayed till August 8 , 1821 . The next interval was longer still , but it was the last . In June , 1822 , Byron began to work at a sixth , and by the end of March , 1823 , he had completed a sixteenth canto . But the publication of these later cantos , which had been declined by Murray , and were finally entrusted to John Hunt , was spread over a period of several months . Cantos VI ., VII ., VIII ., with a Preface , were published July 15 ; Cantos IX ., X ., XI , August 29 ; Cantos XII ., XIII ., XIV ., December 17 , 1823 ; and , finally , Cantos XV ., XVI ., March 26 , 1824 . The composition of Don Juan , considered as a whole , synchronized with the composition of all the dramas ( except Manfred ) and the following poems : The Prophecy of Dante , ( the translation of ) The Morgante Maggiore , The Vision of Judgment , The Age of Bronze , and The Island .</p>
    <p n="8">There is little to be said with regard to the “ Sources ” of Don Juan . Frere 's Whistlecraft had suggested Beppo , and , at the same time , had prompted and provoked a sympathetic study of Frere 's Italian models , Berni and Pulci ( see “ Introduction to Beppo , ” Poetical Works , 1901 , iv . 155-158 ; and “ Introduction to The Morgante Maggiore ” ibid ., pp . 279-281 ) ; and , again , the success of Beppo , and , still more , a sense of inspiration and the conviction that he had found the path to excellence , suggested another essay of the ottava rima , a humorous poem “ à la Beppo ” on a larger and more important scale . If Byron possessed more than a superficial knowledge of the legendary “ Don Juan , ” he was irresponsive and unimpressed . He speaks ( letter to Murray , February 16 , 1821 ) of “ the Spanish tradition ; ” but there is nothing to show that he had read or heard of Tirso de Molina 's ( Gabriel Tellez ) El Burlador de Sevilla y Convidado de Piedra ( The Deceiver of Seville and the Stone Guest ) , 1626 , which dramatized the “ ower true tale ” of the actual Don Juan Tenorio ; or that he was acquainted with any of the Italian ( e. g . Convitato di Pietra , del Dottor Giacinto Andrea Cicognini , Fiorentino [ see L. Allacci Dramaturgia , 1755 , 4º , p. 862 ]) or French adaptations of the legend ( e. g . Le Festin de Pierre , ou le fils criminel , Tragi-comédie de De Villiers , 1659 ; and Molière 's Dom Juan , ou Le Festin de Pierre , 1665 ) . He had seen ( vide post , p. 11 , note 2 ) Delpini 's pantomime , which was based on Shadwell 's Libertine , and he may have witnessed , at Milan or Venice , a performance of Mozart 's Don Giovanni ; but in taking Don Juan for his “ hero , ” he took the name only , and disregarded the “ terrible figure ” “ of the Titan of embodied evil , the likeness of sin made flesh ” ( see Selections from the Works of Lord Byron , by A. C. Swinburne , 1885 , p . xxvi . ) , “ as something to his purpose nothing ” !</p>
    <p n="9">Why , then , did he choose the name , and what was the scheme or motif of his poem ? Something is to be gathered from his own remarks and reflections ; but it must be borne in mind that he is on the defensive , and that his half-humorous paradoxes were provoked by advice and opposition . Writing to Moore ( September 19 , 1818 ) , he says , “ I have finished the first canto ... of a poem in the style and manner of Beppo , encouraged by the good success of the same . It is ... meant to be a little quietly facetious upon every thing . But I doubt whether it is not — at least as far as it has gone — too free for these very modest days . ” The critics before and after publication thought that Don Juan was “ too free , ” and , a month after the two first cantos had been issued , he writes to Murray ( August 12 , 1819 ) , “ You ask me for the plan of Donny Johnny ; I have no plan — I had no plan ; but I had or have materials .... You are too earnest and eager about a work never intended to be serious . Do you suppose that I could have any intention but to giggle and make giggle ?— a playful satire , with as little poetry as could be helped , was what I meant . ” Again , after the completion but before the publication of Cantos III ., IV ., V ., in a letter to Murray ( February 16 , 1821 ) , he writes , “ The Fifth is so far from being the last of Don Juan , that it is hardly the beginning . I meant to take him the tour of Europe , with a proper mixture of siege , battle , and adventure , and to make him finish as Anacharsis Cloots in the French Revolution .... I meant to have made him a Cavalier Servente in Italy , and a cause for a divorce in England , and a Sentimental ‘ Werther-faced ’ man in Germany , so as to show the different ridicules of the society in each of these countries , and to have displayed him gradually gâté and blasé , as he grew older , as is natural . But I had not quite fixed whether to make him end in Hell , or in an unhappy marriage , not knowing which would be the severest . ”</p>
    <p n="10">Byron meant what he said , but he kept back the larger truth . Great works , in which the poet speaks ex animo , and the man lays bare the very pulse of the machine , are not conceived or composed unconsciously and at haphazard . Byron did not “ whistle ” Don Juan “ for want of thought . ” He had found a thing to say , and he meant to make the world listen . He had read with angry disapproval , but he had read , Coleridge 's Critique on [ Maturin 's ] Bertram ( vide post , p. 4 , note 1 ) , and , it may be , had caught an inspiration from one brilliant sentence which depicts the Don Juan of the legend somewhat after the likeness of Childe Harold , if not of Lord Byron : “ Rank , fortune , wit , talent , acquired knowledge , and liberal accomplishments , with beauty of person , vigorous health , ... all these advantages , elevated by the habits and sympathies of noble birth and natural character , are ... combined in Don Juan , so as to give him the means of carrying into all its practical consequences the doctrine of a godless nature ... Obedience to nature is the only virtue . ” Again , “ It is not the wickedness of Don Juan ... which constitutes the character an abstraction , ... but the rapid succession of the correspondent acts and incidents , his intellectual superiority , and the splendid accumulation of his gifts and desirable qualities as coexistent with entire wickedness in one and the same person . ” Here was at once a suggestion and a challenge .</p>
    <p n="11">Would it not be possible to conceive and to depict an ideal character , gifted , gracious , and delightful , who should “ carry into all its practical consequences ” the doctrine of a mundane , if not godless doctrine , and , at the same time , retain the charities and virtues of uncelestial but not devilish manhood ? In defiance of monition and in spite of resolution , the primrose path is trodden by all sorts and conditions of men , sinners no doubt , but not necessarily abstractions of sin , and to assert the contrary makes for cant and not for righteousness . The form and substance of the poem were due to the compulsion of Genius and the determination of Art , but the argument is a vindication of the natural man . It is Byron 's “ criticism of life . ” Don Juan was taboo from the first . The earlier issues of the first five cantos were doubly anonymous . Neither author nor publisher subscribed their names on the title-page . The book was a monster , and , as its maker had foreseen , “ all the world ” shuddered . Immoral , in the sense that it advocates immoral tenets , or prefers evil to good , it is not , but it is unquestionably a dangerous book , which ( to quote Kingsley 's words used in another connection ) “ the young and innocent will do well to leave altogether unread . ” It is dangerous because it ignores resistance and presumes submission to passion ; it is dangerous because , as Byron admitted , it is “ now and then voluptuous ; ” and it is dangerous , in a lesser degree , because , here and there , the purport of the quips and allusions is gross and offensive . No one can take up the book without being struck and arrested by these violations of modesty and decorum ; but no one can master its contents and become possessed of it as a whole without perceiving that the mirror is held up to nature , that it reflects spots and blemishes which , on a survey of the vast and various orb , dwindle into natural and so comparative insignificance . Byron was under no delusion as to the grossness of Don Juan . His plea or pretence , that he was sheltered by the superior grossness of Ariosto and La Fontaine , of Prior and of Fielding , is nihil ad rem , if it is not insincere . When Murray ( May 3 , 1819 ) charges him with “ approximations to indelicacy , ” he laughs himself away at the euphemism , but when Hobhouse and “ the Zoili of Albemarle Street ” talked to him “ about morality , ” he flames out , “ I maintain that it is the most moral of poems . ” He looked upon his great work as a whole , and he knew that the “ raison d'être of his song ” was not only to celebrate , but , by the white light of truth , to represent and exhibit the great things of the world — Love and War , and Death by sea and land , and Man , half-angel , half-demon — the comedy of his fortunes , and the tragedy of his passions and his fate .</p>
    <p n="12">Don Juan has won great praise from the great . Sir Walter Scott ( Edinburgh Weekly Journal , May 19 , 1824 ) maintained that its creator “ has embraced every topic of human life , and sounded every string of the divine harp , from its slightest to its most powerful and heart-astounding tones . ” Goethe ( Kunst und Alterthum , 1821 [ ed . Weimar , iii . 197 , and Sämmtliche Werke , xiii . 637 ]) described Don Juan as “ a work of boundless genius . ” Shelley ( letter to Byron , October 21 , 1821 ) , on the receipt of Cantos III ., IV ., V ., bore testimony to his “ wonder and delight : ” “ This poem carries with it at once the stamp of originality and defiance of imitation . Nothing has ever been written like it in English , nor , if I may venture to prophesy , will there be , unless carrying upon it the mark of a secondary and borrowed light .... You are building up a drama , ” he adds , “ such as England has not yet seen , and the task is sufficiently noble and worthy of you . ” Again , of the fifth canto he writes ( Shelley 's Prose Works , ed . H. Buxton Forman , iv . 219 ) , “ Every word has the stamp of immortality .... It fulfils , in a certain degree , what I have long preached of producing — something wholly new and relative to the age , and yet surpassingly beautiful . ” Finally , a living poet , neither a disciple nor encomiast of Byron , pays eloquent tribute to the strength and splendour of Don Juan : “ Across the stanzas ... we swim forward as over the ‘ broad backs of the sea ; ’ they break and glitter , hiss and laugh , murmur and move like waves that sound or that subside . There is in them a delicious resistance , an elastic motion , which salt water has and fresh water has not . There is about them a wide wholesome air , full of vivid light and constant wind , which is only felt at sea . Life undulates and Death palpitates in the splendid verse .... This gift of life and variety is the supreme quality of Byron 's chief poem ” ( A Selection , etc ., by A. C. Swinburne , 1885 , p . x . ) .</p>

   <p>{ 3 }[ 1 ] [ “ As the Poem is to be published anonymously , omit the Dedication . I wo n't attack the dog in the dark . Such things are for scoundrels and renegadoes like himself ” [ Revise ] . See , too , letter to Murray , May 6 , 1819 ( Letters , 1900 , iv . 294 ) ; and Southey 's letter to Bedford , July 31 , 1819 ( Selections from the Letters , etc ., 1856 , in . 137 , 138 ) . According to the editor of the Works of Lord Byron , 1833 ( xv . 101 ) , the existence of the Dedication “ became notorious ” in consequence of Hobhouse 's article in the Westminster Review , 1824 . He adds , for Southey 's consolation and encouragement , that “ for several years the verses have been selling in the streets as a broadside , ” and that “ it would serve no purpose to exclude them on the present occasion . ” But Southey was not appeased . He tells Allan Cunningham ( June 3 , 1833 ) that “ the new edition of Byron 's works is ... one of the very worst symptoms of these bad times ” ( Life and Correspondence , 1850 , vi . 217 ) . ]</p>
   <p>{ 4 }[ 2 ] [ In the “ Critique on Bertram , ” which Coleridge contributed to the Courier , in 1816 , and republished in the Biographia Literaria , in 1817 ( chap , xxiii . ) , he gives a detailed analysis of “ the old Spanish play , entitled Atheista Fulminato [ vide ante , the ‘ Introduction to Don Juan ’ ] ... which under various names ( Don Juan , the Libertine , etc . ) has had its day of favour in every country throughout Europe ... Rank , fortune , wit , talent , acquired knowledge , and liberal accomplishments , with beauty of person , vigorous health , and constitutional hardihood ,— all these advantages , elevated by the habits and sympathies of noble birth and national character , are supposed to have combined in Don Juan , so as to give him the means of carrying into all its practical consequences the doctrine of a godless nature , as the sole ground and efficient cause not only of all things , events , and appearances , but likewise of all our thoughts , sensations , impulses , and actions . Obedience to nature is the only virtue . ” It is possible that Byron traced his own lineaments in this too life-like portraiture , and at the same time conceived the possibility of a new Don Juan , “ made up ” after his own likeness . His extreme resentment at Coleridge 's just , though unwise and uncalled-for , attack on Maturin stands in need of some explanation . See letter to Murray , September 17 , 1817 ( Letters , 1900 , iv . 172 ) . ]</p>
   <note>3 ] [ “ Have you heard that Don Juan came over with a dedication to me , in which Lord Castlereagh and I ( being hand in glove intimates ) were coupled together for abuse as ‘ the two Roberts ’ ? A fear of persecution ( sic ) from the one Robert is supposed to be the reason why it has been suppressed ” ( Southey to Rev . H. Hill , August 13 , 1819 , Selections from the Letters , etc ., 1856 , iii . 142 ) . For “ Quarrel between Byron and Southey , ” see Introduction to The Vision of Judgment , Poetical Works , 1901 , iv . 475-480 ; and Letters , 1901 , vi . 377-399 ( Appendix I . ) .</note>

   <p>[ Wordsworth obtained his appointment as Distributor of Stamps for the county of Westmoreland in March , 1813 , through Lord Lonsdale 's “ patronage ” ( see his letter , March 6 , 1813 ) . The Excursion was dedicated to Lord Lonsdale in a sonnet dated July 29 , 1814 —</p>

Imagine what must be the man 's talent for Odium , who has contrived to spread his infamy like a pestilence from Ireland to Italy , and to make his name an execration in all languages . ” — Letter to Murray , May 8 , 1820 , Letters , 1901 , v. 22 , note 1 .</note>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 18 ]</span>[ “ In the eighth and concluding lecture of Mr. Hazlitt 's canons of criticism , delivered at the Surrey Institution ( The English Poets , 1870 , pp . 203 , 204 ) , I am accused of having ‘ lauded Buonaparte to the skies in the hour of his success , and then peevishly wreaking my disappointment on the god of my idolatry . ’ The first lines I ever wrote upon Buonaparte were the ‘ Ode to Napoleon , ’ after his abdication in 1814 . All that I have ever written on that subject has been done since his decline ;— I never ‘ met him in the hour of his success . ’ I have considered his character at different periods , in its strength and in its weakness : by his zealots I am accused of injustice — by his enemies as his warmest partisan , in many publications , both English and foreign .</p>
   <p>“ For the accuracy of my delineation I have high authority . A year and some months ago , I had the pleasure of seeing at Venice my friend the honourable Douglas Kinnaird . In his way through Germany , he told me that he had been honoured with a presentation to , and some interviews with , one of the nearest family connections of Napoleon ( Eugène Beauharnais ) . During one of these , he read and translated the lines alluding to Buonaparte , in the Third Canto of Childe Harold . He informed me , that he was authorized by the illustrious personage — ( still recognized as such by the Legitimacy in Europe ) — to whom they were read , to say , that ‘ the delineation was complete , ’ or words to this effect . It is no puerile vanity which induces me to publish this fact ;— but Mr. Hazlitt accuses my inconsistency , and infers my inaccuracy . Perhaps he will admit that , with regard to the latter , one of the most intimate family connections of the Emperor may be equally capable of deciding on the subject . I tell Mr. Hazlitt that I never flattered Napoleon on the throne , nor maligned him since his fall . I wrote what I think are the incredible antitheses of his character .</p>
   <p>“ Mr. Hazlitt accuses me further of delineating myself in Childe Harold , etc ., etc . I have denied this long ago — but , even were it true , Locke tells us , that all his knowledge of human understanding was derived from studying his own mind . From Mr. Hazlitt 's opinion of my poetry I do not appeal ; but I request that gentleman not to insult me by imputing the basest of crimes ,— viz . ‘ praising publicly the same man whom I wished to depreciate in his adversity : ’ — the first lines I ever wrote on Buonaparte were in his dispraise , in 1814 ,— the last , though not at all in his favour , were more impartial and discriminative , in 1818 . Has he become more fortunate since 1814 ? ” For Byron 's various estimates of Napoleon 's character and career , see Childe Harold , Canto III , stanza xxxvi . line 7 , Poetical Works , 1899 , ii . 238 , note 1 . ]</p>

Is there any resemblance ? If there be , it is in those who make it — I can see none . ” — Letters , 1900 , iv . 477 .

I did not know , ” he adds , “ till afterwards the real object of their visit . I thought their questions singular , frivolous , and somewhat importunate , if not impertinent : but what should I have thought , if I had known that they were sent to provide proofs of my insanity ? ” Lady Byron , in her Remarks on Mr. Moore 's Life , etc . ( Life , pp . 661-663 ) , says that Dr. Baillie ( vide post , p. 412 , note 2 ) , whom she consulted with regard to her husband 's supposed insanity , “ not having had access to Lord Byron , could not pronounce a positive opinion on this point . ” It appears , however , that another doctor , a Mr . Le Mann ( see Letters , 1899 , iii . 293 , note 1 , 295 , 299 , etc . ) , visited Byron professionally , and reported on his condition to Lady Byron .

   <p>The text is based on a second or revised copy of stanzas cxc. - cxcviii . Many of the corrections and emendations which were inserted in the first draft are omitted in the later and presumably improved version . Byron 's first intention was to insert seven stanzas after stanza clxxxix ., descriptive and highly depreciatory of Brougham , but for reasons of “ fairness ” ( vide infra ) he changed his mind . The casual mention of “ blundering Brougham ” in English Bards , etc . ( line 524 , Poetical Works , 1898 , i . 338 , note 2 ) , is a proof that his suspicions were not aroused as to the authorship of the review of Hours of Idleness ( Edin . Rev ., January , 1808 ) , and it is certain that Byron 's animosity was due to the part played by Brougham at the time of the Separation . ( In a letter to Byron , dated February 18 , 1817 , Murray speaks of a certain B . “ as your incessant persecutor — the source of all affected public opinion respecting you . ” ) The stanzas , with the accompanying notes , are not included in the editions of 1833 or 1837 , and are now printed for the first time .</p>

   <p>NOTE TO THE ANNEXED STANZAS ON BROUGHAM .</p>
   <p>“ Distrusted by the Democracy , disliked by the Whigs , and detested by the Tories , too much of a lawyer for the people , and too much of a demagogue for Parliament , a contestor of counties , and a Candidate for cities , the refuse of half the Electors of England , and representative at last upon sufferance of the proprietor of some rotten borough , which it would have been more independent to have purchased , a speaker upon all questions , and the outcast of all parties , his support has become alike formidable to all his enemies ( for he has no friends ) , and his vote can be only valuable when accompanied by his Silence . A disappointed man with a bad temper , he is endowed with considerable but not first-rate abilities , and has blundered on through life , remarkable only for a fluency , in which he has many rivals at the bar and in the Senate , and an eloquence in which he has several Superiors . ‘ Willing to wound and not afraid to strike , until he receives a blow in return , he has not yet betrayed any illegal ardour , or Irish alacrity , in accepting the defiances , and resenting the disgraceful terms which his proneness to evil-speaking have ( sic ) brought upon him . In the cases of Mackinnon and Manners , [* E ] he sheltered himself behind those parliamentary privileges , which Fox , Pitt , Canning , Castlereagh , Tierney , Adam , Shelburne , Grattan , Corry , Curran , and Clare disdained to adopt as their buckler . The House of Commons became the Asylum of his Slander , as the Churches of Rome were once the Sanctuary of Assassins .</p>
   <p>“ His literary reputation ( with the exception of one work of his early career ) rests upon some anonymous articles imputed to him in a celebrated periodical work ; but even these are surpassed by the Essays of others in the same Journal . He has tried every thing and succeeded in nothing ; and he may perhaps finish as a Lawyer without practice , as he has already been occasionally an orator without an audience , if not soon cut short in his career .</p>
   <p>“ The above character is not written impartially , but by one who has had occasion to know some of the baser parts of it , and regards him accordingly with shuddering abhorrence , and just so much fear as he deserves . In him is to be dreaded the crawling of the centipede , not the spring of the tiger — the venom of the reptile , not the strength of the animal — the rancour of the miscreant , not the courage of the Man .</p>
   <p>“ In case the prose or verse of the above should be actionable , I put my name , that the man may rather proceed against me than the publisher — not without some faint hope that the brand with which I blast him may induce him , however reluctantly , to a manlier revenge . ”</p>
   <note>* E ] [ Possibly George Manners ( 1778-1853 ) , editor of The Satirist , whose appointment to a foreign consulate Brougham sharply criticized in the House of Commons , July 9 , 1817 ( Parl . Deb ., vol . xxxvi . pp . 1320 , 1321 ) ; and Daniel Mackinnon ( 1791-1836 ) , the nephew of Henry Mackinnon , who fell at Ciudad Rodrigo . Byron met “ Dan ” Mackinnon at Lisbon in 1809 , and ( Gronow , Reminiscences , 1889 , ii . 259 , 260 ) was amused by his “ various funny stories . ”</note>

   <p>but I do not mean them for present publication , because I will not , at this distance , publish that of a Man , for which he has a claim upon another too remote to give him redress .</p>
   <p>“ With regard to the Miscreant Brougham , however , it was only long after the fact , and I was made acquainted with the language he had held of me on my leaving England ( with regard to the D ^ ss ^ of D .' s house ) , [* F ] and his letter to Me . de Staël , and various matters for all of which the first time he and I foregather — be it in England , be it on earth — he shall account , and one of the two be carried home .</p>
   <p>“ As I have no wish to have mysteries , I merely prohibit the publication of these stanzas in print , for the reasons of fairness mentioned ; but I by no means wish him not to know their existence or their tenor , nor my intentions as to himself : he has shown no forbearance , and he shall find none . You may show them to him and to all whom it may concern , with the explanation that the only reason that I have not had satisfaction of this man has been , that I have never had an opportunity since I was aware of the facts , which my friends had carefully concealed from me ; and it was only by slow degrees , and by piecemeal , that I got at them . I have not sought him , nor gone out of my way for him ; but I will find him , and then we can have it out : he has shown so little courage , that he must fight at last in his absolute necessity to escape utter degradation .</p>
   <p>“ I send you the stanzas , which ( except the last ) have been written nearly two years , merely because I have been lately copying out most of the MSS . which were in my drawers . ”</p>

   <note>86 ] [ Here , and elsewhere in Don Juan , Byron attacked Coleridge fiercely and venomously , because he believed that his protégé had accepted patronage and money , and , notwithstanding , had retailed scandalous statements to the detriment and dishonour of his advocate and benefactor ( see letter to Murray , November 24 , 1818 , Letters , 1900 , iv . 272 ; and “ Introduction to the Vision of Judgment , ” Poetical Works , 1901 , iv . 475 ) . Byron does not substantiate his charge of ingratitude , and there is nothing to show whether Coleridge ever knew why a once friendly countenance was changed towards him . He might have asked , with the Courtenays , Ubi lapsus , quid feci ? If Byron had been on his mind or his conscience he would have drawn up an elaborate explanation or apology ; but nothing of the kind is extant . He took the abuse as he had taken the favours — for the unmerited gifts of the blind goddess Fortune . ( See , too , Letter ..., by John Bull , 1821 , p . 14 . )</note>

It was written off-hand , and in the midst of circumstances not very favourable to facetiousness , so that there may , perhaps , be more bitterness than enough for that sort of small acid punch . ” The letter was in reply to a criticism of Don Juan ( Cantos I ., II . ) in the British Review ( No . xxvii ., 1819 , vol . 14 , pp . 266-268 ) , in which the Editor assumed , or feigned to assume , that the accusation of bribery was to be taken au grand sérieux . ]</p>

To secure this union , King Cheops is said , by Herodotus , to have employed three hundred and sixty thousand of his subjects for twenty years in raising over the ‘ angusta domus ’ destined to hold his remains , a pile of stone equal in weight to six millions of tons , which is just three times that of the vast Breakwater thrown across Plymouth Sound ; and , to render this precious dust still more secure , the narrow chamber was made accessible only by small , intricate passages , obstructed by stones of an enormous weight , and so carefully closed externally as not to be perceptible .— Yet , how vain are all the precautions of man ! Not a bone was left of Cheops , either in the stone coffin , or in the vault , when Shaw entered the gloomy chamber .</note>

     <l n="5">Where the blue veins looked shadowy , shrunk , and weak ;</l>
     <l n="6">And his black curls were dewy with the spray ,</l>
     <l n="7">Which weighed upon them yet , all damp and salt ,</l>

     <l n="3">Drooped as the willow when no winds can breathe ,</l>
     <l n="4">Lulled like the depth of Ocean when at rest ,</l>
     <l n="5">Fair as the crowning rose of the whole wreath ,</l>
     <l n="6">Soft as the callow cygnet in its nest ; [ bp ]</l>
     <l n="7">In short , he was a very pretty fellow ,</l>

     <l n="1">He woke and gazed , and would have slept again ,</l>

     <l n="3">Those eyes to close , though weariness and pain</l>
     <l n="4">Had further sleep a further pleasure made :</l>
     <l n="5">For Woman 's face was never formed in vain</l>

     <l n="4">As with an effort she began to speak ;</l>
     <l n="5">Her eyes were eloquent , her words would pose ,</l>

     <l n="4">So soft , so sweet , so delicately clear ,</l>

     <l n="6">The sort of sound we echo with a tear ,</l>

     <l n="4">By the watchman , or some such reality ,</l>
     <l n="5">Or by one 's early valet 's curséd knock ;</l>
     <l n="6">At least it is a heavy sound to me ,</l>
     <l n="7">Who like a morning slumber — for the night</l>

     <l n="2">Or sleep , or whatsoe'er it was , by feeling</l>
     <l n="3">A most prodigious appetite ; the steam</l>
     <l n="4">Of Zoe 's cookery no doubt was stealing</l>
     <l n="5">Upon his senses , and the kindling beam</l>
     <l n="6">Of the new fire , which Zoe kept up , kneeling ,</l>
     <l n="7">To stir her viands , made him quite awake</l>

     <l n="4">A joint upon their barbarous spits they put on :</l>
     <l n="5">But this occurs but seldom , between whiles ,</l>
     <l n="6">For some of these are rocks with scarce a hut on ;</l>
     <l n="7">Others are fair and fertile , among which</l>

     <l n="5">We know , too , they are very fond of war ,</l>
     <l n="6">A pleasure — like all pleasures — rather dear ;</l>
     <l n="7">So were the Cretans — from which I infer ,</l>

     <l n="1">But to resume . The languid Juan raised</l>
     <l n="2">His head upon his elbow , and he saw</l>
     <l n="3">A sight on which he had not lately gazed ,</l>
     <l n="4">As all his latter meals had been quite raw ,</l>
     <l n="5">Three or four things , for which the Lord he praised ,</l>

     <l n="7">He fell upon whate'er was offered , like</l>

    <head>CLVIII .</head>
     <l n="1">He ate , and he was well supplied ; and she ,</l>

     <l n="3">Him past all bounds , because she smiled to see</l>
     <l n="4">Such appetite in one she had deemed dead :</l>
     <l n="5">But Zoe , being older than Haidée ,</l>
     <l n="6">Knew ( by tradition , for she ne'er had read )</l>
     <l n="7">That famished people must be slowly nurst ,</l>

     <l n="1">And so she took the liberty to state ,</l>
     <l n="2">Rather by deeds than words , because the case</l>
     <l n="3">Was urgent , that the gentleman , whose fate</l>
     <l n="4">Had made her mistress quit her bed to trace</l>
     <l n="5">The sea-shore at this hour , must leave his plate ,</l>
     <l n="6">Unless he wished to die upon the place —</l>
     <l n="7">She snatched it , and refused another morsel ,</l>

     <l n="1">Next they — he being naked , save a tattered</l>
     <l n="2">Pair of scarce decent trowsers — went to work ,</l>
     <l n="3">And in the fire his recent rags they scattered ,</l>
     <l n="4">And dressed him , for the present , like a Turk ,</l>
     <l n="5">Or Greek — that is , although it not much mattered ,</l>
     <l n="6">Omitting turban , slippers , pistol , dirk ,—</l>

     <l n="5">And , as he interrupted not , went eking</l>
     <l n="6">Her speech out to her protégé and friend ,</l>
     <l n="7">Till pausing at the last her breath to take ,</l>
     <l n="8">She saw he did not understand Romaic .</l>

   <lg type="poem">

     <l n="1">And then she had recourse to nods , and signs ,</l>

     <l n="3">And read ( the only book she could ) the lines</l>
     <l n="4">Of his fair face , and found , by sympathy ,</l>
     <l n="5">The answer eloquent , where the Soul shines</l>
     <l n="6">And darts in one quick glance a long reply ;</l>
     <l n="7">And thus in every look she saw expressed</l>
     <l n="8">A world of words , and things at which she guessed .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>CLXIII .</head>
     <l n="1">And now , by dint of fingers and of eyes ,</l>
     <l n="2">And words repeated after her , he took</l>
     <l n="3">A lesson in her tongue ; but by surmise ,</l>
     <l n="4">No doubt , less of her language than her look :</l>
     <l n="5">As he who studies fervently the skies</l>

The pumps were immediately sounded , and in the course of a few minutes the water had increased to four feet ....</p>
   <p>“ One gang was instantly put on them , and the remainder of the people employed in getting up rice from the run of the ship , and heaving it over , to come at the leak , if possible . After three or four hundred bags were thrown into the sea , we did get at it , and found the water rushing into the ship with astonishing rapidity ; therefore we thrust sheets , shirts , jackets , tales of muslin , and everything of the like description that could be got , into the opening .</p>
   <p>“ Notwithstanding the pumps discharged fifty tons of water an hour , the ship certainly must have gone down , had not our expedients been attended with some success .

As the next day advanced , the weather appeared to moderate , the men continued incessantly at the pumps , and every exertion was made to keep the ship afloat . ” — See “ Loss of the American ship Hercules , Captain Benjamin Stout , June 16 , 1796 , ” Shipwrecks and Disasters at Sea , 1812 , iii . 316 , 317 . ]</p>

On cutting one or two lanyards , the mizen-mast went first over , but without producing the smallest effect on the ship , and , on cutting the lanyard of one shroud , the main-mast followed . I had next the mortification to see the foremast and bowsprit also go over .

By the way , much of the description of the furniture , in Canto Third , is taken from Tully 's Tripoli ( pray note this ) , and the rest from my own observation . Remember , I never meant to conceal this at all , and have only not stated it , because Don Juan had no preface , nor name to it . ” — Letter to Murray , August 23 , 1821 , Letters , 1901 , v. 346 .</p>
   <p>The first edition of “ Tully 's Tripoli ” is entitled Narrative of a Ten Years ’ Residence in Tripoli In Africa : From the original correspondence in the possession of the Family of the late Richard Tully , Esq ., the British Consul , 1816 , 410 . The book is in the form of letters ( so says the Preface ) written by the Consul 's sister . The description of Haidée 's dress is taken from the account of a visit to Lilla Kebbiera , the wife of the Bashaw ( p. 30 ) ; the description of the furniture and refreshments from the account of a visit to “ Lilla Amnani , ” Hadgi Abderrahmam 's Greek wife ( pp . 132-137 ) . It is evident that the “ Chiel ” who took these “ notes ” was the Consul 's sister , not the Consul : “ Lilla Aisha , the Bey 's wife , is thought to be very sensible , though rather haughty . Her apartments were grand , and herself superbly habited . Her chemise was covered with gold embroidery at the neck ; over it she wore a gold and silver tissue jileck , or jacket without sleeves , and over that another of purple velvet richly laced with gold , with coral and pearl buttons set quite close together down the front ; it had short sleeves finished with a gold band not far below the shoulder , and discovered a wide loose chemise of transparent gauze , with gold , silver , and ribband strips . She wore round her ancles ... a sort of fetter made of a thick bar of gold so fine that they bound it round the leg with one hand ; it is an inch and a half wide , and as much in thickness : each of these weighs four pounds . Just above this a band three inches wide of gold thread finished the ends of a pair of trousers made of pale yellow and white silk . ”</p>
   <p>Page 132 . “ [ Lilla ] rose to take coffee , which was served in very small china cups , placed in silver filigree cups ; and gold filigree cups were put under those presented to the married ladies . They had introduced cloves , cinnamon , and saffron into the coffee , which was abundantly sweetened ; but this mixture was very soon changed , and replaced by excellent simple coffee for the European ladies .... ”</p>
   <p>Page 133 . “ The Greek then shewed us the gala furniture of her own room .... The hangings of the room were of tapestry , made in pannels of different coloured velvets , thickly inlaid with flowers of silk damask ; a yellow border , of about a foot in depth , finished the tapestry at top and bottom , the upper border being embroidered with Moorish sentences from the Koran in lilac letters . The carpet was of crimson satin , with a deep border of pale blue quilted ; this is laid over Indian mats and other carpets . In the best part of the room the sofa is placed , which occupies three sides in an alcove , the floor of which is raised . The sofa and the cushions that lay around were of crimson velvet , the centre cushions were embroidered with a sun in gold of highly embossed work , the rest were of gold and silver tissue . The curtains of the alcove were made to match those before the bed . A number of looking-glasses , and a profusion of fine china and chrystal completed the ornaments and furniture of the room , in which were neither tables nor chairs . A small table , about six inches high , is brought in when refreshments are served ; it is of ebony , inlaid with mother-of-pearl , tortoiseshell , ivory , gold and silver , of choice woods , or of plain mahogany , according to the circumstances of the proprietor . ”</p>
   <p>Page 136 . “ On the tables were placed all sorts of refreshments , and thirty or forty dishes of meat and poultry , dressed different ways ; there were no knives nor forks , and only a few spoons of gold , silver , ivory , or coral .... ”</p>
   <p>Page 137 . “ The beverage was various sherbets , some composed of the juice of boiled raisins , very sweet ; some of the juice of pomegranates squeezed through the rind ; and others of the pure juice of oranges . These sherbets were copiously supplied in high glass ewers , placed in great numbers on the ground .... After the dishes of meat were removed , a dessert of Arabian fruits , confectionaries , and sweetmeats was served ; among the latter was the date-bread . This sweetmeat is made in perfection only by the blacks at Fezzan , of the ripe date of the country .... They make it in the shape of loaves , weighing from twenty to thirty pounds ; the stones of the fruit are taken out , and the dates simply pressed together with great weights ; thus preserved , it keeps perfectly good for a year . ” ]</p>

When he calculates that the reader is on the verge of pitying him , he takes care to throw him back the defiance of laughter , as if to let him know that all the Poet 's pathos is but the sentimentalism of the drunkard between his cups , or the relenting softness of the courtesan , who the next moment resumes the bad boldness of her degraded character .

   <note>265 ] [ In his Essay , Supplement to the Preface ( Poems by William Wordsworth , ed . 1820 , iii . 315-348 ) , Wordsworth maintains that the appreciation of great poetry is a plant of slow growth , that immediate recognition is a mark of inferiority , or is to be accounted for by the presence of adventitious qualities : “ So strange , indeed , are the obliquities of admiration , that they whose opinions are much influenced by authority will often be tempted to think that there are no fixed principles in human nature for this art to rest upon .... Away , then , with the senseless iteration of the word popular ! ... The voice that issues from this spirit [ of human knowledge ] is that Vox Populi which the Deity inspires . Foolish must he be who can mistake for this a local acclamation , or a transitory outcry — transitory though it be for years , local though from a Nation . Still more lamentable is his error who can believe that there is anything of divine infallibility in this clamour of that small though loud portion of the community ever governed by factitious influence , which under the name of the PUBLIC , passes itself upon the unthinking for the PEOPLE . ” Naturally enough Byron regarded this pronouncement as a taunt if not as a challenge . Wordsworth 's noble appeal from a provincial to an imperial authority , from the present to the future , is not strengthened by the obvious reference to the popularity of contemporaries .</note>

   <note>“ December 9 , 1820 . I open my letter to tell you a fact , which will show the state of this country better than I can . The commandant of the troops is now lying dead in my house . He was shot at a little past eight o'clock , about two hundred paces from my door . I was putting on my great coat to visit Madame la Comtessa G ., when I heard the shot . On coming into the hall , I found all my servants on the balcony , exclaiming that a man was murdered . I immediately ran down , calling on Tita ( the bravest of them ) to follow me . The rest wanted to hinder us from going , as it is the custom for everybody here , it seems , to run away from ‘ the stricken deer . ’ ... we found him lying on his back , almost , if not quite , dead , with five wounds ; one in the heart , two in the stomach , one in the finger , and the other in the arm . Some soldiers cocked their guns , and wanted to hinder me from passing . However , we passed , and I found Diego , the adjutant , crying over him like a child — a surgeon , who said nothing of his profession — a priest , sobbing a frightened prayer — and the commandant , all this time , on his back , on the hard , cold pavement , without light or assistance , or anything around him but confusion and dismay . As nobody could , or would , do anything but howl and pray , and as no one would stir a finger to move him , for fear of consequences , I lost my patience — made my servant and a couple of the mob take up the body — sent off two soldiers to the guard — despatched Diego to the Cardinal with the news , and had him carried upstairs into my own quarters . But it was too late — he was gone .... I had him partly stripped — made the surgeon examine him , and examined him myself . He had been shot by cut balls or slugs . I felt one of the slugs , which had gone through him , all but the skin .... He only said , ‘ O Dio ! ’ and ‘ Gesu ! ’ two or three times , and appeared to have suffered little . Poor fellow ! he was a brave officer ; but had made himself much disliked by the people . ” — Letter to Moore , December 9 , 1820 , Letters , 1901 , v. 133 .

   <p>PREFACE TO CANTOS VI ., VII ., AND VIII .</p>
   <p>THE details of the siege of Ismail in two of the following cantos ( i. e . the seventh and eighth ) are taken from a French Work , entitled Histoire de la Nouvelle Russie .<span type="note_anchor">[ 319 ]</span>Some of the incidents attributed to Don Juan really occurred , particularly the circumstance of his saving the infant , which was the actual case of the late Duc de Richelieu , then a young volunteer in the Russian service , and afterward the founder and benefactor of Odessa , where his name and memory can never cease to be regarded with reverence .</p>
   <p>In the course of these cantos , a stanza or two will be found relative to the late Marquis of Londonderry ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 320 ]</span>but written some time before his decease . Had that person 's oligarchy died with him , they would have been suppressed ; as it is , I am aware of nothing in the manner of his death or of his life to prevent the free expression of the opinions of all whom his whole existence was consumed in endeavouring to enslave . That he was an amiable man in private life , may or may not be true : but with this the public have nothing to do ; and as to lamenting his death , it will be time enough when Ireland has ceased to mourn for his birth . As a minister , I , for one of millions , looked upon him as the most despotic in intention , and the weakest in intellect , that ever tyrannised over a country . It is the first time indeed since the Normans that England has been insulted by a minister ( at least ) who could not speak English , and that Parliament permitted itself to be dictated to in the language of Mrs. Malaprop .</p>
   <p>Of the manner of his death little need be said , except that if a poor radical , such as Waddington or Watson ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 321 ]</span>had cut his throat , he would have been buried in a cross-road , with the usual appurtenances of the stake and mallet . But the minister was an elegant lunatic — a sentimental suicide — he merely cut the “ carotid artery , ” ( blessings on their learning ! ) and lo ! the pageant , and the Abbey ! and “ the syllables of dolour yelled forth "[ 322 ] by the newspapers — and the harangue of the Coroner in a eulogy over the bleeding body of the deceased — ( an Anthony worthy of such a Cæsar ) — and the nauseous and atrocious cant of a degraded crew of conspirators against all that is sincere and honourable . In his death he was necessarily one of two things by the law<span type="note_anchor">[ 323 ]</span>— a felon or a madman — and in either case no great subject for panegyric .<span type="note_anchor">[ 324 ]</span>In his life he was — what all the world knows , and half of it will feel for years to come , unless his death prove a “ moral lesson ” to the surviving Sejani<span type="note_anchor">[ 325 ]</span>of Europe . It may at least serve as some consolation to the nations , that their oppressors are not happy , and in some instances judge so justly of their own actions as to anticipate the sentence of mankind . Let us hear no more of this man ; and let Ireland remove the ashes of her Grattan from the sanctuary of Westminster . Shall the patriot of humanity repose by the Werther of politics !! !</p>
   <p>With regard to the objections which have been made on another score to the already published cantos of this poem , I shall content myself with two quotations from Voltaire :— “ La pudeur s'est enfuite des coeurs , et s'est refugiée sur les lèvres . ” ... “ Plus les moeurs sont dépravés , plus les expressions deviennent mesurées ; on croit regagner en langage ce qu'on a perdu en vertu . ”</p>
   <p>This is the real fact , as applicable to the degraded and hypocritical mass which leavens the present English generation , and is the only answer they deserve . The hackneyed and lavished title of Blasphemer — which , with Radical , Liberal , Jacobin , Reformer , etc ., are the changes which the hirelings are daily ringing in the ears of those who will listen — should be welcome to all who recollect on whom it was originally bestowed . Socrates and Jesus Christ were put to death publicly as blasphemers , and so have been and may be many who dare to oppose the most notorious abuses of the name of God and the mind of man . But persecution is not refutation , nor even triumph : the “ wretched infidel , ” as he is called , is probably happier in his prison than the proudest of his assailants . With his opinions I have nothing to do — they may be right or wrong — but he has suffered for them , and that very suffering for conscience ’ sake will make more proselytes to deism than the example of heterodox<span type="note_anchor">[ 326 ]</span>Prelates to Christianity , suicide statesmen to oppression , or overpensioned homicides to the impious alliance which insults the world with the name of “ Holy ! "[ 327 ] I have no wish to trample on the dishonoured or the dead ; but it would be well if the adherents to the classes from whence those persons sprung should abate a little of the cant which is the crying sin of this double-dealing and false-speaking time of selfish spoilers , and —— but enough for the present .</p>

Ed . 3 tom . 1827 ) , was , at one time , resident at Odessa , where he met and made the acquaintance of Armand Emanuel , Duc de Richelieu , who took part in the siege of Ismail . M. Léon de Crousaz-Crétet describes him as “ ancien surintendant des théâtres sous l'Empereur Paul . ” — Le Duc de Richelieu , 1897 , p . 83 . ]</head>

   <p>{ 266 }[ 321 ] [ Samuel Ferrand Waddington , born 1759 , hop-grower and radical politician , first came into notice as the chairman of public meetings in favour of making peace with the French in 1793 . He was the author , inter alia , of A Key to a Delicate Investigation , 1812 , and An Address to the People of the United Kingdom , 1812 . He was alive in 1822 . James Watson ( 1766-1838 ) , a radical agitator of the following of Thomas Spence , was engaged , in the autumn of 1816 , in an abortive conspiracy to blow up cavalry barracks , barricade the streets , and seize the Bank and the Tower . He was tried for high treason before Lord Ellenborough , and acquitted . ]</p>

   <note>324 ] [ Mr. Joseph Carttar , of Deptford , coroner for the County of Kent , addressed the jury at some length . The following sentences are taken from the report of the inquest , contained in The Annual Biography and Obituary for the year 1823 , vol . vii . p. 57 : “ As a public man , it is impossible for me to weigh his character in any scales that I can hold . In private life I believe the world will admit that a more amiable man could not be found .... If it should unfortunately appear that there is not sufficient evidence to prove what is generally considered the indication of a disordered mind , I trust that the jury will pay some attention to my humble opinion , which is , that no man can be in his proper senses at the moment he commits so rash an act as self-murder . ... The Bible declares that a man clings to nothing so strongly as his own life , I therefore view it as an axiom , and an abstract principle , that a man must necessarily be out of his mind at the moment of destroying himself . ” Byron , probably , read the report of the inquest in Cobbett 's Weekly Register ( August 17 , 1822 , vol . 43 , pp . 389-425 ) . The “ eulogy ” was in perfectly good taste , but there can be little doubt that if “ Waddington or Watson ” had cut their “ carotid arteries , ” the verdict would have been different .</note>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 325 ]</span>From this number must be excepted Canning . Canning is a genius , almost a universal one , an orator , a wit , a poet , a statesman ; and no man of talent can long pursue the path of his late predecessor , Lord C. If ever man saved his country , Canning can , but will he ? I for one , hope so .</p>
   <note>The phrase , “ great moral lesson , ” was employed by the Duke of Wellington , à propos of the restoration of pictures and statues to their “ rightful owners , ” in a despatch addressed to Castlereagh , under date , Paris , September 19 , 1815 ( The Dispatches , etc . ( ed . by Colonel Gurwood ) , 1847 , viii . 270 ) . The words , “ moral lesson , ” as applied to the French generally , are to be found in Scott 's Field of Waterloo ( conclusion , stanza vi . line 3 ) , which was written about the same time as the despatch . Byron quotes them in his “ Ode from the French , ” stanza iv . line 8 ( see Poetical Works , 1900 , iii . 434 , note 1 ) . There is a satirical allusion to the Duke 's “ assumption of the didactic ” about teaching a “ great moral lesson ” in the Preface to the first number of the Liberal ( 1822 , p . xi . ) .</note>
   <p>{ 267 }[ 326 ] When Lord Sandwich said “ he did not know the difference between orthodoxy and heterodoxy , ” Warburton , the bishop , replied , “ Orthodoxy , my lord , is my doxy , and heterodoxy is another man 's doxy . ” A prelate of the present day has discovered , it seems , a third kind of doxy , which has not greatly exalted in the eyes of the elect that which Bentham calls “ Church-of-Englandism . ”</p>

Tooke , 1880 , iii . 324 ) . His character has been drawn by Louis Philippe , Comte de Ségur , who , writes Tooke ( ibid ., p. 326 ) , “ lived a long time in habits of intimacy with him , and was so obliging as to delineate it at our solicitation . ” “ In his person were collected the most opposite defects and advantages of every kind . He was avaricious and ostentatious , ... haughty and obliging , politic and confiding , licentious and superstitious , bold and timid , ambitious and indiscreet ; lavish of his bounties to his relations , his mistresses , and his favourites , yet frequently paying neither his household nor his creditors . His consequence always depended on a woman , and he was always unfaithful to her . Nothing could equal the activity of his mind , nor the indolence of his body . No dangers could appal his courage ; no difficulties force him to abandon his projects . But the success of an enterprise always brought on disgust .... Everything with him was desultory ; business , pleasure , temper , carriage . His presence was a restraint on every company . He was morose to all that stood in awe of him , and caressed all such as accosted him with familiarity .... None had read less than he ; few people were better informed .... One while he formed the project of becoming Duke of Courland ; at another he thought of bestowing on himself the crown of Poland . He frequently gave intimations of an intention to make himself a bishop , or even a simple monk . He built a superb palace , and wanted to sell it before it was finished . In his youth he had pleased her [ Catherine ] by the ardour of his passion , by his valour , and by his masculine beauty .... Become the rival of Orloff , he performed for his sovereign whatever the most romantic passion could inspire . He put out his eye , to free it from a blemish which diminished his beauty . Banished by his rival , he ran to meet death in battle , and returned with glory . ” ]</p>

   <p>“ L'arrivée du comte Souvorow produisit un grand effet parmi les troupes .... La manière d'être plus que simple , puis-qu'il logeait sous une canonnière , et qu'il n'avait pas même de chaises dans sa tente , son affabilité , sa bonhomie lui conciliaient l'affection de tous les individus de son armée . Cet homme singulier qui ressemble plus à un chef de cosaques ou de Tartares , qu'au général d'une armée européenne , est doué d'une intrépidité et d'une hardiesse peu communes .... La manière de vivre , de s'habiller et de parler du comte Souvorow , est aussi singulière que ses opinions militaires .... II mangeait dans sa tente assis par terre autour d'une natte sur laquelle il prenait le plus détestable repas . L'apreshYpppHeNmidi , un semblable repas lui servait de souper , il s'endormait ensuite pendant quelques heures , passait une partie de la nuit à chanter , et a la pointe du jour il sortait presque nu et se roulait sur l'herbe assurant que cet exercice lui était necessaire pour le preserver des rhumatismes .... Sa manière de s'exprimer dans toutes les langues est aussi singulière que toute sa façon d'être , ses phrases sont incohérentes , et s'il n'est pas insensé , il dit et fait du moins tout ce qu'il faut pour le paraître ; mais il est heureux et cette quality dont le Cardinal Mazarin faisait tant de cas , est , à bon droit , fort estimée de l'Impératrice et du Prince Potemkin ...

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 408 ]</span>[ For a detailed account of Suvóroff 's personal characteristics , see The Life of Field-Marshal Souvaroff , by L. M. P . Tranchant de Laverne , 1814 , pp . 267-291 ; and Suvóroff , by Lieut. - Colonel Spalding , 1890 , pp . 222-229 .</p>
   <p>Byron 's epithet “ buffoon ” ( line 5 ) may , perhaps , be traced to the following anecdote recorded by Tranchant de Laverne ( p. 281 ): “ During the first war of Poland ... he published , in the order of the day , that at the first crowing of the cock the troops would march to attack the enemy , and caused the spy to send word that the Russians would be upon them some time after midnight . But about eight o'clock Souvarof ran through the camp , imitating the crowing of a cock .... The enemy , completely surprised , lost a great number of men . ”</p>
   <p>For his “ praying ” ( line 6 ) , vide ibid ., pp . 272 , 273 : “ He made a short prayer after each meal , and again when going to bed . He usually performed his devotions before an image of St. Nicholas , the patron saint of Russia . ”</p>
   <p>“ Half-dirt ” ( line 5 ) is , however , a calumny ( ibid . p. 272 ): “ It was his custom to rise at the earliest dawn ; several buckets of cold water were thrown over his naked body . ”</p>
   <p>The same writer ( p. 268 ) repudiates the charges of excessive barbarity and cruelty brought against Suvóroff by C. F. P . Masson , in his Mémoires Secrets sur la Russie ( vide , e. g ., ed . 1800 , i . 311 ): “ Souvorow ne scroit que le plus ridicule bouffon , s'il n'étoit pas montré le plus barbare guerrier . C'est un monstre , qui renferme dans le corps d'un singe l'âme d'un chien de boucher . Attila , son compatriote , et do n't il descend , peut-être ne fut ni si heureux , ni si féroce . ”</p>
   <p>Suvóroff did not regard himself as “ half-demon . ” “ Your pencil , ” he reminded the artist Müller , “ will delineate the features of my face . These are visible : but my inner man is hidden . I must tell you that I have shed rivers of blood . I tremble , but I love my neighbour . In my whole life I have made no one unhappy ; not an insect hath perished by my hand . I was little ; I was big . In fortune 's ebb and flow , relying on God , I stood immovable — even as now . ” ( Suvóroff , 1890 , p. 228 , note . )]</p>

Byron alludes to this comparison in his Detached Thoughts , October 15 , 1821 , Letters , 1901 , v. 408 . It may be noted that Lorenzo Bartolini , the Italian sculptor who took a bust of Byron at Pisa , in the spring of 1822 , had been employed by Napoleon , in 1814 , to design marble vases for a terrace at Elba , which were to be illuminated at night “ from within . ” ]</p>

   <note>J. H . Castéra ( Vie de Catherine II ., 1797 , ii . 374 ) relates this incident in connection with the fall of Turtukey ( or Tutrakaw ) in Bulgaria , giving the words in French , “ Gloire à Dieu ! Louange à Catherine ! Toutoukai est pris . Souwaroff y est entré . ” W. Tooke ( Life of Catherine II ., 1800 , iii . 278 ) . Castéra 's translator , gives the original Russian with an English version . But according to Spalding ( Suvóroff , 1890 , pp . 42 , 43 ) , the words , which were written on a scrap of paper , and addressed to Soltikoff , ran thus : “ Your Excellency , we have conquered . Glory to God ! Glory to you ! Alexander Suvóroff . ” When Ismail was taken he wrote to Potemkin , “ The Russian standard floats above the walls of Ismail , ” and to the Empress , “ Proud Ismail lies at your Majesty 's feet . ” The tenour of the poetical message on the fall of Tutrakaw recalls the triumphant piety of the Emperor William I. of Germany .

   <note>478 ] Query , Ney ?— Printer 's Devil . [ Michel Ney , Duke of Elchingen , “ the bravest of the brave ” ( see Ode from the French , stanza i. Poetical Works , 1900 , iii . 431 ) , born January 10 , 1769 , was arrested August 5 , and shot December 7 , 1815 .</note>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 479 ]</span>[ The story of the attempted assassination ( February 11 , 1818 ) of the Duke of Wellington , which is dismissed by Alison in a few words ( Hist . of Europe ( 1815-1852 ) , 1853 , i . 577 , 578 ) , occupies many pages of the Supplementary Despatches ( 1865 , xii . 271-546 ) . Byron probably drew his own conclusions as to the Kinnaird-Marinet incident , from the Letter to the Duke of Wellington on the Arrest of M. Marinet , by Lord Kinnaird , 1818 . The story , which is full of interest , may be briefly recounted . On January 30 , 1818 , Lord Kinnaird informed Sir George Murray ( Chief of the Staff of the Army of Occupation ) that a person , whose name he withheld , had revealed to him the existence of a plot to assassinate the Duke of Wellington . At 12. 30 a. m ., February 11 , 1818 , the Duke , on returning to his Hotel , was fired at by an unknown person ; and then , but not till then , he wrote to urge Lord Clancarty to advise the Prince Regent to take steps to persuade or force Kinnaird to disclose the name of his informant . A Mr. G. W . Chad , of the Consular Service , was empowered to proceed to Brussels , and to seek an interview with Kinnaird . He carried with him , among other documents , a letter from the Duke to Lord Clancarty , dated February 12 , 1818 . A postscript contained this intimation : “ It may be proper to mention to you that the French Government are disposed to go every length in the way of negotiation with the person mentioned by Lord Kinnaird , or others , to discover the plot . ”</p>
   <p>Kinnaird absolutely declined to give up the name of his informant , but , acting on the strength of the postscript , which had been read but not shown to him , started for Paris with “ the great unknown . ” Some days after their arrival , and while Kinnaird was a guest of the Duke , the man was arrested , and discovered to be one Nicholle or Marinet , who had been appointed receveur under the restored government of Louis XVIII ., but during the Cent jours had fled to Belgium , retaining the funds he had amassed during his term of office . Kinnaird regarded this action of the French Government as a breach of faith , and in a “ Memorial ” to the French Chamber of Peers , and his Letter , maintained that the Duke 's postscript implied a promise of a safe conduct for Marinet to and from Paris to Brussels . The Duke , on the other hand , was equally positive ( see his letter to Lord Liverpool , May 30 , 1818 ) “ that he never intended to have any negotiations with anybody . ” Kinnaird was a “ dog with a bad name , ” He had been accused ( see his Letter to the Earl of Liverpool , 1816 , p. 16 ) of “ the promulgation of dangerous opinions , ” and of intimacy “ with persons suspected . ” The Duke speaks of him as “ the friend of Revolutionists ” ! It is evident that he held the dangerous doctrine that a promise to a rogue is a promise , and that the authorities took a different view of the ethics of the situation . It is clear , too , that the Duke 's postscript was ambiguous , but that it did not warrant the assumption that if Marinet went to Paris he should be protected . The air was full of plots . The great Duke despised and was inclined to ignore the pistol or the dagger of the assassin ; but he believed that “ mischief was afoot , ” and that “ great personages ” might or might not be responsible . He was beset by difficulties at every turn , and would have been more than mortal if he had put too favourable a construction on the scruples , or condoned the imprudence of a “ friend of Revolutionists . ” ]</p>
   <p>{ 374 }[ 480 ] [ The reference may be to the Duke of Wellington 's intimacy with Lady Frances Wedderburn Webster . Byron had “ passed that way ” himself ( see Letters , 1898 , ii . 251 , note i , 323 , etc . ) , and could hardly attack the Duke on that score . ]</p>

Masson , in his Mémoires Secrets , etc ., 1880 , i . 150-178 , gives a list of twelve favourites , and in this Canto , Don Juan takes upon himself the characteristics of at least three , Lanskoï , Zoritch ( or Zovitch ) , and Plato Zoubof . For example ( p. 167 ) , “ Zoritch ... est le seul étranger qu'elle ait osé créer son favori pendant son regne . C'étoit un Servien échappé du bagne de Constantinople où il étoit prisonnier : il parut , pour la première fois , en habit de hussard à la cour . Il éblouit tout le monde par sa beauté , et les vielles dames en parlent encore comme d'un Adonis . ” M. Waliszewski , in his Romance of an Empress ( 1894 ) , devotes a chapter to “ Private Life and Favouritism ” ( ii . 234-286 ) , in which he graphically describes the election and inauguration of the Vremienchtchik , “ the man of the moment , ” paramour regnant , and consort of the Empress pro hac vice : “ ‘ We may observe in Russia a sort of interregnum in affairs , caused by the displacement of one favourite and the installation of his successor . ’ ... The interregnums are , however , of very short duration . Only one lasts for several months , between the death of Lanskoï ( 1784 ) and the succession of Iermolof .... There is no lack of candidates . The place is good .... Sometimes , too , on the height by the throne , reached at a bound , these spoilt children of fate grow giddy .... It is over in an instant , at an evening reception it is noticed that the Empress has gazed attentively at some obscure lieutenant , presented but just before ... next day it is reported that he has been appointed aide-de-camp to her Majesty . What that means is well known . Next day he finds himself in the special suite of rooms .... The rooms are already vacated , and everything is prepared for the new-comer . All imaginable comfort and luxury ... await him ; and , on opening a drawer , he finds a hundred thousand roubles [ about £ 20 , 000 ] , the usual first gift , a foretaste of Pactolus . That evening , before the assembled court , the Empress appears , leaning familiarly on his arm , and on the stroke of ten , as she retires , the new favourite follows her ” ( ibid ., pp . 246-249 ) . ]</p>

   <note>Lanskoi was a youth of as fine and interesting a figure as the imagination can paint . Of all Catherine 's favourites , he was the man whom she loved the most . In 1784 he was attacked with a fever , and perished in the arms of her Majesty . When he was no more , Catherine gave herself up to the most poignant grief , and remained three months without going out of her palace of Tzarsko-selo . She afterwards raised a superb monument to his memory . ( See Life of Catherine II ., by W. Tooke , 1800 , iii . 88 , 89 . )</note>
   <note>510 ] [ Ten months after the death of Lanskoi , the Empress consoled herself with Iermolof , described , by Bezborodky , as “ a modest refined young man , who cultivates the society of serious people . ” In less than a year this excellent youth is , in turn , displaced by Dmitrief Mamonof . His petit nom was Red Coat , and , for a time , he is a “ priceless creature . ” “ He has , ” says Catherine , “ two superb black eyes , with eyebrows outlined as one rarely sees ; about the middle height , noble in manner , easy in demeanour . ” But Mamonof suffered from “ scruples of conscience , ” and , after a while , with Catherine 's consent and blessing , was happily married to the Princess Shtcherbatof , a maid of honour , and not , as Byron supposed , a rival “ man of the moment . ” — See The Story of a Throne , by K.

Her hair was auburn , her eyebrows black and rather thick , and her blue eyes had a gentleness which was often affected , but oftener still a mixture of pride .

The tree was so much decayed that it was taken down in 1820 ” ( Memoirs , etc ., of Sir Isaac Newton , by Sir David Brewster , 1855 , i . 27 , note 1 ) .

   <note>541 ] [ In a letter to his sister , October 25 , 1804 ( Letters , 1898 , i . 40 ) , Byron mentions an aunt — “ the amiable antiquated Sophia , ” and asks , “ Is she yet in the land of the living , or does she sing psalms with the Blessed in the other world ? ” This was his father 's sister , Sophia Maria , daughter of Admiral the Hon . John Byron . But his “ good old aunt ” is , more probably , the Hon . Mrs. Frances Byron , widow of George ( born April 22 , 1730 ) son of the fourth , and brother of the “ Wicked ” lord . She was the daughter and co-heiress of Ellis Levett , Esq ., and lived “ at Nottingham in her own house . ” She died , aged 86 , June 13 , 1822 , not long before this Canto was written . She is described in the obituary notice of the Gentleman 's Magazine , June , 1822 , vol . 92 , p. 573 , as “ Daughter of Vice-Admiral the Hon . John Byron ( who sailed round the world with Lord Anson ) , grandfather of the present Lord Byron . ” But that is , chronologically , impossible . Byron must have retained a pleasing recollection of the ear-trumpet and the spectacles , and it gratified his kindlier humour to embalm their owner in his verse .</note>
   <note>542 ] [ See Collins 's Peerage , 1779 , vii . 120 . It is probable that Byron was lineally descended from Ralph de Burun , of Horestan , who is mentioned in Doomsday Book ( sect . xi . ) as holding eight lordships in Notts and five in Derbyshire , but with regard to Ernysius or Erneis the pedigree is silent .

   <note>545 ] [ Matthew Baillie ( 1761-1823 ) , the nephew of William Hunter , the brother of Agnes and Joanna Baillie , was a celebrated anatomist . He attended Byron ( 1799-1802 ) , when an endeavour was made to effect a cure of the muscular contraction of his right leg and foot . He was consulted by Lady Byron , in 1816 , with regard to her husband 's supposed derangement , but was not admitted when he called at the house in Piccadilly . He is said to have “ avoided technical and learned phrases ; to have affected no sentimental tenderness , but expressed what he had to say in the simplest and plainest terms ” ( Annual Biography , 1824 , p. 319 ) . Jekyll ( Letters , 1894 , p. 110 ) repeats or invents an anecdote that “ the old king , in his mad fits , used to say he could bring any dead people to converse with him , except those who had died under Baillie 's care , for that the doctor always dissected them into so many morsels , that they had not a leg to walk to Windsor with . ” It is hardly necessary to say that John Abernethy ( 1764-1831 ) “ expressed what he had to say ” in the bluntest and rudest terms at his disposal .</note>

All these places were furnished with magnificent tents for breakfasts , lunches , dinners , suppers , and sleeping-rooms ... deserted regions were at once transformed into fields , groves , villages : ...

   <p>[ “ Ernest John Biren was born in Courland [ in 1690 ] . His grandfather had been head groom to James , the third Duke of Courland , and obtained from his master the present of a small estate in land .... In 1714 he made his appearance at St. Petersburg , and solicited the place of page to the Princess Charlotte , wife of the Tzarovitch Alexey ; but being contemptuously rejected as a person of mean extraction , retired to Mittau , where he chanced to ingratiate himself with Count Bestuchef , Master of the Household to Anne , widow of Frederic William , Duke of Courland , who resided at Mittau . Being of a handsome figure and polite address , he soon gained the good will of the duchess , and became her secretary and chief favourite . On her being declared sovereign of Russia , Anne called Biren to Petersburg , and the secretary soon became Duke of Courland , and first minister or rather despot of Russia . On the death of Anne , which happened in 1740 , Biren , being declared regent , continued daily increasing his vexations and cruelties , till he was arrested , on the 18th of December , only twenty days after he had been appointed to the regency ; and at the revolution that ensued he was exiled to the frozen shores of the Oby . ” Catherine II ., by W.

A “ swell ” or “ rank swell ” ( “ real swell ” appears in Egan 's Life in London ) is the more recent “ toff ; ” and “ flash ” is “ fly , ” “ down , ” or “ awake , ” i. e . knowing , not easily imposed upon .</note>

Integrity , impartiality , good-nature , and manliness , are the corner-stones of his understanding . ” Byron once said of him that “ his manners were infinitely superior to those of the Fellows of the College whom I meet at the high table ” ( J. W . Clark , Cambridge , 1890 , p. 140 ) . ( See , too , letter to John Jackson , September 18 , 1808 , Letters , 1898 , i . 189 , note 2 ; Hints from Horace , line 638 , Poetical Works , 1898 , i . 433 , note 3 . ) As to the stanza quoted by Egan ( Anecdotes of the Turf , 1827 , p. 44 ) , but not traduced or interpreted , “ To be hobbled for making a clout ” is to be taken into custody for stealing a handkerchief , to “ turn snitch ” is to inform , and the “ forty ” is the £ 40 offered for the detection of a capital crime , and shared by the police or Bow Street runners . Dangerous characters were let alone and tacitly encouraged to continue their career of crime , until the measure of their iniquity was full , and they “ weighed forty . ” If Jack was clumsy enough to be detected in a trifling theft , his “ blowen ” would go over to the enemy , and betray him for the sake of the Government reward ( see Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue , by Francis Grose , 1823 , art . “ Weigh forty ” ) .</note>

See The Tale of Two Cities , by Charles Dickens , cap . xxii . ; see , too , Carlyle 's French Revolution , 1839 , i . 253 : “ With wild yells , Sansculottism clutches him , in its hundred hands : he is whirled ... to the ‘ Lanterne , ’ ... pleading bitterly for life ,— to the deaf winds . Only with the third rope ( for two ropes broke , and the quavering voice still pleaded ) , can he be so much as got hanged !

The riddle was first read to me by a young and pretty heiress , on my praising the “ drapery ” of the “ untochered ” but “ pretty virginities ” ( like Mrs. Anne Page ) of the then day , which has now been some years yesterday : she assured me that the thing was common in London ; and as her own thousands , and blooming looks , and rich simplicity of array , put any suspicion in her own case out of the question , I confess I gave some credit to the allegation .

George IV . conceived that it devolved upon him personally , and not on the Crown , and “ consequently appropriated to himself the whole of the money and the jewels . ” It is possible that this difference between the brothers was noised abroad , and that old stories of the destruction of royal wills were revived to the new king 's discredit .

   <p>{ 495 }[ 668 ] [ Byron 's description of the place of his inheritance , which was to know him no more , is sketched from memory , but it unites the charm of a picture with the accuracy of a ground-plan . Eight years had gone by since he had looked his last on “ venerable arch ” and “ lucid lake ” ( see “ Epistle to Augusta , ” stanza viii . lines 7 , 8 ) , but he had not forgotten , he could not forget , that enchanted and enchanting scene .</p>
   <p>Newstead Abbey or Priory was founded by Henry II ., by way of deodand or expiation for the murder of Thomas Becket . Lands which bordered the valley of the Leen , and which had formed part of Sherwood Forest , were assigned for the use and endowment of a chapter of “ black canons regular of the order of St. Augustine , ” and on a site , by the river-side to the south of the forest uplands ( stanza lv . lines 5-8 ) the new stede , or place , or station , arose . It was a “ Norman Abbey ” ( stanza lv . line 1 ) which the Black Canons dedicated to Our Lady , and , here and there , in the cloisters , traces of Norman architecture remain , but the enlargement and completion of the monastery was carried out in successive stages and “ transition periods , ” in a style or styles which , perhaps , more by hap than by cunning , Byron rightly named “ mixed Gothic ” ( stanza lv . line 4 ) . To work their mills , and perhaps to drain the marshy valley , the monks dammed the Leen and excavated a chain of lakes — the largest to the north-west , Byron 's “ lucid lake ; ” a second to the south of the Abbey ; and a third , now surrounded with woods , and overlooked by the “ wicked lord 's ” “ ragged rock ” below the Abbey , half a mile to the south-east . The “ cascade , ” which flows over and through a stone-work sluice , and forms a rocky water-fall , issues from the upper lake , and is in full view of the west front of the Abbey . Almost at right angles to these lakes are three ponds : the Forest Pond to the north of the stone wall , which divides the garden from the forest ; the square “ Eagle ” Pond in the Monks ’ Garden ; and the narrow stew-pond , bordered on either side with overhanging yews , which drains into the second or Garden Lake . Byron does not enlarge on this double chain of lakes and ponds , and , perhaps for the sake of pictorial unity , converts the second ( if a second then existed ) and third lakes into a river .</p>
   <p>The Abbey , which , at the dissolution of monasteries in 1539 , was handed over by Henry VIII . to Sir John Byron , “ steward and warden of the forest of Shirewood , ” was converted , here and there , more or less , into a baronial “ mansion ” ( stanza lxvi . ) . It is , roughly speaking , a square block of buildings , flanking the sides of a grassy quadrangle . Surrounding the quadrangle are two-storied cloisters , and in the centre a “ Gothic fountain ” ( stanza lxv . line 1 ) of composite workmanship . The upper portion of the stonework is hexagonal , and is ornamented with a double row of gargoyles ( all “ monsters ” and no “ saints , ” recalling , perhaps identical with , the “ seven deadly sins ” gargoyles , still in situ in the quadrangle of Magdalen College , Oxford ) ; the lower half , which belongs to the seventeenth or eighteenth century , is hollowed into niches of a Roman or classical design . ( In Byron 's time the fountain stood in a courtyard in front of the Abbey , but before he composed this canto it had been restored by Colonel Wildman to its original place within the quadrangle . Byron was acquainted with the change , and writes accordingly . ) When the Byrons took possession of the Abbey the upper stories of the cloisters were converted , on three sides of the quadrangle , into galleries , and on the fourth , the north side , into a library . Abutting on the cloisters are the monastic buildings proper , in part transformed , but with “ much of the monastic ” preserved . On the west , the front of the Abbey , the ground floor consists of the entrance hall and Monks ’ Parlour , and , above , the Guests ’ Refectory or Banqueting-hall , and the Prior 's Parlour . On the south , the Xenodochium or Guesten Hall , and , above , the Monks ’ Refectory , or Grand Drawing-room ; on the south and east , on the ground floor , the Prior 's Lodgings , the Chapter House ( “ the exquisite small chapel , ” stanza lxvi . line 5 ) , the “ slype ” or passage between church and Chapter House ; and in the upper story , the state bedrooms , named after the kings , Edward III ., Henry VII ., etc ., who , by the terms of the grant of land to the Prior and Canons , were entitled to free quarters in the Abbey . During Byron 's brief tenure of Newstead , and for long years before , these “ huge halls , long galleries , and spacious chambers ” ( stanza lxxvii . line 1 ) were half dismantled , and in a more or less ruinous condition . A few pictures remained on the walls of the Great Drawing-room , of the Prior 's Parlour , and in the apartments of the south-east wing or annexe , which dates from the seventeenth century ( see the account of a visit to Newstead in 1812 , in Beauties of England and Wales , 1813 , xii . 401-405 ) . There are and were portraits , by Lely ( stanza lxviii . line 7 ) , of a Lady Byron , of Fanny Jennings , Duchess of Tyrconnel , “ loveliness personified , ” of Mrs. Hughes , and of Nell Gwynne ; by Sir Godfrey Kneller , of William and Mary ; by unnamed artists , of George I. and George II . ; and by Ramsay , of George III . There are portraits of a fat Prior , William Sandall , with a jewelled reliquary ; of “ Sir John the Little with the Great Beard , ” who ruled in the Prior 's stead ; and there is the portrait , a votive tablet of penitence and remorse , “ of that Lord Arundel Who struck in heat the child he loved so well ” ( see “ A Picture at Newstead , ” by Matthew Arnold , Poetical Works , 1890 , p. 177 ) ; but of portraits of judges or bishops , or of pictures by old masters , there is neither trace nor record .</p>
   <p>But the characteristic feature of Newstead Abbey , so familiar that description seems unnecessary , and , yet , never quite accurately described , is the west front of the Priory Church , which is in line with the west front of the Abbey . “ Half apart , ” the southern portion of this front , which abuts on the windows of the Prior 's Parlour , and the room above , where Byron slept , flanks and conceals the west end of the north cloisters and library ; but , with this exception , it is a screen , and nothing more . In the centre is the “ mighty window ” ( stanza lxii . line 1 ) , shorn of glass and tracery ; above are six lancet windows ( which Byron seems to have regarded as niches ) , and , above again , in a “ higher niche ” ( stanza lxi . line 1 ) , is the crowned Virgin with the Babe in her arms , which escaped , as by a miracle , the “ fiery darts ” — the shot and cannon-balls of the Cromwellian troopers . On either side of the central window are “ two blank windows containing tracery [ ‘ geometrical decorated ’ ] ... carved [ in relief ] on the solid ashlar ; ” on either side of the window , and at the northern and southern extremities of the front , are buttresses with canopied niches , in each of which a saint or apostle must once have stood . Over the west door there is the mutilated figure of (? ) the Saviour , but of twelve saints or twelve niches there is no trace . The “ grand arch ” is an ivy-clad screen , and nothing more . Behind and beyond , in place of vanished nave , of aisle and transept , is the smooth green turf ; and at the east end , on the site of the high altar , stands the urn-crowned masonry of Boatswain 's tomb .</p>

But , if not , an incident which took place in the House of Commons , April 17 , 1823 , during a debate on Catholic Emancipation , may be quoted in corroboration of Brougham 's unreadiness with regard to the point of honour . In the course of his speech he accused Canning of “ monstrous truckling for the purpose of obtaining office , ” and Canning , without waiting for Brougham to finish , gave him the lie : “ I rise to say that that is false ” ( Parl .

He was the lifelong companion , if not friend , of Talleyrand , who pleaded for him : “ Qui est-ce qui ne l'aimerait pas , il est si vicieux ! ” At one time in the pay of Napoleon , he fell under his displeasure , and , to avoid arrest , spent two years of exile ( 1812-14 ) in England . “ He was not , ” says Gronow , “ a great talker , nor did he swagger ... or laugh at his own bons-mots . He was demure , sleek , sly , and dangerous .... In the London clubs he went by the name of Old French . ” He was a constant guest of the Duke of York 's at Oatlands , “ and won much at his whist-table ” ( English Whist , by W. P .

The particular allusion is to his alleged inaction at a critical moment in the engagement of September 11 , 1814 , between Commodore Macdonough and Captain Downie in Plattsburg Bay . “ A letter was sent to Capt . Downie , strongly urging him to come on , as the army had long been waiting for his co-operation .... The brave Downie replied that he required no urging to do his duty ....

He delighted in pleasantries , and always afforded to his auditors abundance of mirth and entertainment as well as information . ” Byron seems to have supposed that these “ pleasantries ” found their way into his addresses to condemned prisoners , but if the charges printed in his Miscellaneous Works , edited by John Nichols in 1818 , are reported in full , he was entirely mistaken .

They may talk about the beauties of nature , but the angler merely thinks of his dish of fish ; he has no leisure to take his eyes from off the streams , and a single bite is worth to him more than all the scenery around .

   <note>The story is that his son John , who had been sent to represent him at the Congress of Westphalia , 1648 , wrote home to complain that the task was beyond him , and that he could not cope with the difficulties which he was encountering , and that the Chancellor replied , “ Nescis , mi fili , quantillâ prudentiâ homines regantur . ” — Biographie Universelle , art . “ Oxenstierna . ”</note>

Hence , when Jupiter and Juno fell to wrangling on the comparative enjoyments of men and women , the question was referred to Tiresias , as a person of unusual experience and authority . He gave it in favour of the woman , and Juno , who was displeased at his answer , struck him with blindness . But Jupiter , to make amends , gave him the “ liberty of prophesying ” for seven , some say nine , generations .

See , for instance , a review by J. H . Markland , who afterwards made his name as editor of the Roxburgh Club issue of the Chester Mysteries ( whence , perhaps , Byron derived his knowledge of “ Mysteries and Moralities ” ) , which concludes thus : “ Heartily hoping that the ‘ illness and depression of spirits , ’ which evidently pervade the greater part of these effusions , are entirely dispelled ; confident that ‘ George Gordon , Lord Byron ’ will have a conspicuous niche in the future editions of ‘ Royal and Noble Authors , ’ etc . ” — Gent .

   <note>The Harmonists were emigrants from Würtemburg , who settled ( 1803-1805 ) under the auspices of George Rapp , in a township 120 miles north of Philadelphia .

The Black Friar walked and walks in the Guests ’ Refectory ( or Banqueting Hall , or “ Gallery ” of this stanza ) , which adjoins the Prior 's Parlour , but the room where Byron slept ( in a four-post bed-a coronet , at each corner , atop ) is on the floor above the Prior 's Parlour , and can only be approached by a spiral staircase . Both rooms look west , and command a view of the “ lake 's billow ” and the “ cascade . ” Moreover , the Guests ’ Refectory was never hung with “ old pictures . ” It would seem that Don Juan ( perhaps Byron on an emergency ) slept in the Prior 's Parlour , and that in the visionary Newstead the pictures forsook the Grand Drawing-Room for the Hall .

It is said that the Newstead ghost appeared , also , to Lord Byron 's cousin , Miss Fanny Parkins , and that she made a sketch of him from memory . ” The legend of the Black Friar may , it is believed at Newstead ( et vide post , “ Song , ” stanza ii . line 5 , p. 583 ) , be traced to the alarm and suspicion of the country-folk , who , on visiting the Abbey , would now and then catch sight of an aged lay-brother , or monkish domestic , who had been retained in the service of the Byrons long after the Canons had been “ turned adrift . ” He would naturally keep out of sight of a generation who knew not monks , and , when surprised in the cloisters or ruins of the church , would glide back to his own quarters in the dormitories . ]</p>

The kitchen and domestic offices , which extended at right angles to the west front of the Abbey ( see “ Newstead from a Picture by Peter Tilleman , circ . 1720 ” Letters , 1898 , i . ( to face p .) 216 ) , were pulled down and rebuilt , the massive Sussex Tower ( so named in honour of H. R.

But in any case , he will be preferable to “ Imbéciles . ” There is a glorious field for him , if he know how to cultivate it .</p>

   <p>The devil looked over Lincoln because the unexampled height of the central tower of the cathedral excited his envy and alarm ; or , as Fuller ( Worthies : Lincolnshire ) has it , “ overlooked this church , when first finished , with a torve and tetrick countenance , as maligning men 's costly devotions . ” So , at least , the vanity of later ages interpreted the saying ; but a time was when the devil “ looked over ” Lincoln to some purpose , for in A. D. 1185 an earthquake clave the Church of Remigius in twain , and in 1235 a great part of the central tower , which had been erected by Bishop Hugh de Wells , fell and injured the rest of the building . ]</p>

   <p>{ 601 }[ 803 ] In French “ mobilité . ” I am not sure that mobility is English ; but it is expressive of a quality which rather belongs to other climates , though it is sometimes seen to a great extent in our own . It may be defined as an excessive susceptibility of immediate impressions — at the same time without losing the past : and is , though sometimes apparently useful to the possessor , a most painful and unhappy attribute .</p>
   <note>“ That he was fully aware not only of the abundance of this quality in his own nature , but of the danger in which it placed consistency and singleness of character , did not require the note on this passage to assure us . The consciousness , indeed , of his own natural tendency to yield thus to every chance impression , and change with every passing impulse , was not only for ever present in his mind , but ... had the effect of keeping him in that general line of consistency , on certain great subjects , which ... he continued to preserve throughout life . ” — Life , p. 646 . “ Mobility ” is not the tendency to yield to every impression , to change with every impulse , but the capability of being moved by many and various impressions , of responding to an ever-renewed succession of impulses . Byron is defending the enthusiastic temperament from the charge of inconstancy and insincerity .</note>
