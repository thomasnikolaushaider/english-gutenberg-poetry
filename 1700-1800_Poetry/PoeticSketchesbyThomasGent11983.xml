    <docTitle><titlePart>Oh , ye ! enthron 'd in presidential awe , To give the song-smit generation law ; Who wield Apollo 's delegated rod , And shake Parnassus with your sovereign nod ; A pensive Pilgrim , worn with base turmoils , Plebian cares , and mercenary toils , Implores your pity , while with footsteps rude , He dares within the mountain 's pale intrude ; For , oh ! enchantment through its empire dwells , And rules the spirit with Lethëan spells ; By hands unseen aërial harps are hung , And Spring , like Hebe , ever fair and young , On her broad bosom rears the laughing loves , And breathes bland incense through the warbling groves ; Spontaneous , bids unfading blossoms blow . And nectar 'd streams mellifluously flow . There , while the Muses , wanton , unconfin 'd , And wreaths resplendent round their temples bind , ‘ Tis yours , to strew their steps with votive flowers ; To watch them slumbering midst the blissful bowers ; To guard the shades that hide their sacred charms ; And shield their beauties from unhallow 'd arms ! Oh ! may their suppliant steal a passing kiss ? Alas ! he pants not for superior bliss ; Thrice-bless 'd , his virgin modesty shall be To snatch an evanescent ecstacy ! The fierce extremes of superhuman love , For his frail sense too exquisite might prove ; He turns , all blushing , from th'Aönian shade To humbler raptures , with a mortal maid . I know ‘ tis yours , when unscholastic wights Unloose their fancies in presumptuous flights , Awak 'd to vengeance , on such flights to frown . Clip the wing 'd horse , and roll his rider down . But , if empower 'd to strike th'immortal lyre . The ardent vot'ry glows with genuine fire , ‘ Tis yours , while care recoils , and envy flies Subdued by his resistless energies , ‘ Tis yours to bid Piërian fountains flow , And toast his name in Wit 's seraglio ; To bind his brows with amaranthine bays , And bless , with beef and beer , his mundane days ! Alas ! nor beef , nor beer , nor bays are mine , If by your looks , my doom I may divine , Ye frown so dreadful , and ye swell so big Your fateful arms , the goosequill and the wig : The wig , with wisdom 's somb'rous seal impress 'd , Mysterious terrors , grim portents , invest ; And shame and honor on the goosequill perch , Like doves and ravens on a country church . As some raw ‘ Squire , by rustic nymphs admir 'd , Of vulgar charms , and easy conquests tir 'd , Resolves new scenes and nobler flights to dare , Nor “ waste his sweetness in the desert air ” , To town repairs , some fam 'd assembly seeks , With red importance blust'ring in his cheeks ; But when , electric on th'astonish ' d wight Burst the full floods of music and of light , While levell 'd mirrors multiply the rows Of radiant beauties , and accomplish 'd beaus , At once confounded into sober sense , He feels his pristine insignificance ; And blinking , blund'ring , from the general quiz Retreats , “ to ponder on the thing he is . ” By pride inflated , and by praise allur 'd , Small Authors thus strut forth , and thus get cur 'd ; But , Critics , hear ! an angel pleads for me , That tongueless , ten-tongued cherub , Modesty . Sirs ! if you damn me , you 'll resemble those That flay 'd the Travell'r , who had lost his clothes ; Are there not foes enough to do my books ? Relentless trunk-makers , and pastry-cooks ? Acknowledge not those barbarous allies , The wooden box-men , and the men of pies : For heav'n ' s sake , let it ne'er be understood That you , great Censors ! coalesce with wood ; Nor let your actions contradict your looks , That tell the world you ne'er colleague with cooks . But , if the blithe muse will indulge a smile , Why scowls thy brow , O Bookseller ! the while ? Thy sunk eyes glisten through eclipsing fears , Fill 'd , like Cassandra 's , with prophetic tears : With such a visage , withering , woe-begone , Shrinks the pale poet from the damning dun . Come , let us teach each others tears to flow , Like fasting bards , in fellowship of woe , When the coy muse puts on coquettish airs , Nor deigns one line to their voracious prayers ; Thy spirit , groaning like th'encumber ' d block Which bears my works , deplores them as dead stock , Doom 'd by these undiscriminating times To endless sleep , with Della Cruscan rhymes ; Yes , Critics , whisper thee , litigious wretches ! Oblivion 's hand shall finish all my Sketches . But see , my soul such bug-bears has repell 'd With magnanimity unparallel 'd ! Take up the volumes , every care dismiss , And smile , gruff Gorgon ! while I tell thee this : Not one shall lie neglected on the shelf , All shall be sold — I 'll buy them in myself . POETIC SKETCHES ON THE DEATH OF LORD NELSON . Swift through the land while Fame transported flies , And shouts triumphant shake the illumin 'd skies ; Britannia , bending o'er her dauntless prows , With laurels thickening round her blazon 'd brows , In joy dejected , sees her triumph crost , Exults in Victory won , but mourns the Victor lost . Immortal Nelson ! still with fond amaze , Thy glorious deeds each British eye surveys , Beholds thee still , on conquer 'd floods afar : Fate 's flaming shaft ! the thunderbolt of war ! Hurl 'd from thy hands , Britannia 's vengeance roars , And bloody billows stain the hostile shores ; Thy sacred ire Confed'rate Kingdoms braves And ‘ whelms their Navies in Sepulchral waves !</titlePart></docTitle>

     <p>— Graced with each attribute which Heaven supplies To Godlike Chiefs : humane , intrepid , wise ; His Nation 's bulwark , and all Nature 's pride , The Hero liv 'd , and as he liv 'd — he died — Transcendent Destiny ! how blest the brave Whose fall his Country 's tears attend , shower 'd on his trophied grave ! SONNET . MORNING . Light as the breeze that hails the infant morn The Milkmaid trips , as o'er her arm she slings Her cleanly pail , some favorite lay she sings As sweetly wild , and cheerful , as the horn . O happy girl ! may never faithless love , Or fancied splendor , lead thy steps astray ; No cares becloud the sunshine of thy day , Nor want e'er urge thee from thy cot to rove . What tho ’ thy station dooms thee to be poor , And by the hard-earn 'd morsel thou art fed ; Yet sweet content bedecks thy lowly bed , And health and peace sit smiling at thy door : Of these possess 'd — thou hast a gracious meed , Which Heaven 's high wisdom gives , to make thee rich indeed ! TO ............. AN IMPROMTU . O Sub ! you certainly have been , A little raking , roguish creature , And in that face may still be seen , Each laughing loves bewitching feature ! For thou hast stolen many a heart — And robb 'd the sweetness of the rose ; Plac 'd on that cheek , it doth impart More lovely tints , more fragrant blows ! Yes , thou art nature 's favorite child , Array 'd in smiles , seducing , killing ; Did Joseph live , you 'd drive him wild , And set his very soul a thrilling ! A poet , much too poor to live , Too poor , in this rich world to rove , Too poor , for aught but verse to give , But not , thank God , too poor to love ! Gives thee his little doggerel lay — One truth I tell , in sorrow tell it , I 'm forc 'd to give my verse away , Because , alas ! I cannot sell it . And should you with a critic 's eye , Proclaim me ‘ gainst the Muse a sinner , Reflect , dear girl ! that such as I , Six times a week do n't get a dinner . And want of comfort , food , and wine , Will damp the genius , curb the spirit : These wants I 'll own are often mine ; But can n't allow a want of merit . For every stupid dog that drinks At poet 's pond , nicknam 'd divine : Say what he will , I know he thinks That all he writes is devilish fine ! SONNET . NIGHT . Now when dun Night her shadowy veil has spread , See want and infamy as forth they come , Lead their wan daughter from her branded home , To woo the stranger for unhallow 'd bread . Poor outcast ! o'er thy sickly-tinted cheek And half-clad form , what havock want hath made ; And the sweet lustre of thine eye doth fade , And all thy soul 's sad sorrow seems to speak . O miserable state ! compell 'd to wear The wooing smile , as on thy aching breast Some wretch reclines , who feeling ne'er possess 'd ; Thy poor heart bursting with the stifled tear ! Oh , GOD OF MERCY ! bid her woes subside , And be to her a friend , who hath no friend beside .</p>

       <l n="2">O'er the wide heath now moon-tide horrors hung ,</l>
       <l n="3">And night 's dark pencil dim 'd the tints of spring ;</l>
       <l n="4">The boding minstrel now harsh omens sung ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="6">At that still hour , pale Cynthia oft had seen</l>

       <l n="8">With pensive step , and melancholy mien ,</l>
       <l n="9">O'er the broad plain in love-born anguish stray .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="10">Long had her heart with Henry 's been entwin 'd</l>
       <l n="11">And love 's soft voice had wak 'd the sacred blaze</l>
       <l n="12">Of Hymen 's altar ; while , with him combin 'd ,</l>
       <l n="13">His cherub train prepar 'd the torch to raise :</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="14">When , lo ! his standard raging war uprear 'd ,</l>
       <l n="15">And honor call 'd her Henry from her charms .</l>
       <l n="16">He fought , but ah ! torn , mangled , blood-besmear 'd ,</l>
       <l n="17">Fell , nobly fell , amid his conquering arms !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="18">In her sad bosom , a tumultuous world</l>
       <l n="19">Of hopes and fears on his dear memory spread ;</l>
       <l n="20">For fate had not the clouded roll unfurl 'd ,</l>
       <l n="21">Nor yet with baleful hemlock crown 'd her head .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="22">Reflection , oft to sad remembrace brought</l>
       <l n="23">The well-known spot , where they so oft had stray 'd ;</l>
       <l n="24">While fond affection ten-fold ardor caught .</l>
       <l n="25">And smiling innocence around them play 'd .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="26">But these were past ! and now the distant bell</l>

       <l n="28">Toll 'd midnight out , with long-resounding knell ,</l>
       <l n="29">While dismal echoes quiver 'd in the air .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="30">Again ‘ twas silence — when from out the gloom ,</l>
       <l n="31">She saw , with awe-struck eye , a phantom glide :</l>
       <l n="32">Twas Henry 's form !— what pencil shall presume</l>
       <l n="33">To paint her horror !— HENRY AS HE DIED !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="34">Enervate , long she stood — a sculptur 'd dread ,</l>
       <l n="35">‘ Till waking sense dissolv 'd amazement 's chain ;</l>
       <l n="36">Then home , with timid haste , distracted fled ,</l>
       <l n="37">And sunk in dreadful agony of pain .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="38">Not the deep sigh , which madden 'd Sappho gave ,</l>

       <l n="1">Sweet songstress ! whom the melancholy Muse</l>
       <l n="2">With more than fondness lov 'd , for thee she strung</l>
       <l n="3">The lyre , on which herself enraptur 'd hung ,</l>

       <l n="5">Oft hath my childhood 's tributary tear</l>
       <l n="6">Paid homage to the sad , harmonious strain ,</l>
       <l n="7">That told , alas , too true , the grief and pain ,</l>
       <l n="8">Which thy afflicted mind was doom 'd to bear .</l>
       <l n="9">Rest , sainted spirit ! from a life of woe ,</l>
