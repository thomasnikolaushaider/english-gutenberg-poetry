    <head>NOTES</head>
    <head>ON</head>
    <head>FAUSE FOODRAGE .</head>
     <l n="1">King Easter has courted her for her lands ,</l>
     <l n="2">King Wester for her fee ;</l>
     <l n="3">King Honour , &amp; c .— P. 4. v. 1 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>King Easter and King Wester were probably the petty princes of Northumberland and Westmoreland . In the Complaynt of Scotland , an ancient romance is mentioned , under the title , “ How the king of Estmureland married the king 's daughter of Westmureland , ” which may possibly be the original of the beautiful legend of King Estmere , in the Reliques of Ancient English Poetry , Vol . I. p. 62 4th edit . From this it may be conjectured , with some degree of plausibility , that the independent kingdoms of the east and west coast were , at an early period , thus denominated , according to the Saxon mode of naming districts , from their relative positions ; as Essex , Wessex , Sussex . But the geography of the metrical romances sets all system at defiance ; and in some of these , as Clariodus and Meliades , Estmureland undoubtedly signifies the land of the Easterlings , or the Flemish provinces at which vessels arrived in three days from England , and to which they are represented as exporting wool .— Vide Notes on the Tale of Kempion . On this subject I have , since publication of the first edition , been favoured with the following remarks by Mr Ritson , in opposition to the opinion above expressed :—</p>
   <p>“ Estmureland and Westmureland have no sort of relation to Northumberland and Westmoreland . The former was never called Eastmoreland , nor were there ever any kings of Westmoreland ; unless we admit the authority of an old rhyme , cited by Usher :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Here the king Westmer</l>
     <l n="2">“ Slow the king Rothinger . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ There is , likewise , a ‘ king Estmere , of Spain , ’ in one of Percy 's</l>
     <l n="4">ballads .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ In the old metrical romance of Kyng Horn , or Horn Child , we find both Westnesse and Estnesse ; and it is somewhat singular , that two places , so called , actually exist in Yorkshire at this day . But ness , in that quarter , is the name given to an inlet from a river . There is , however , great confusion in this poem , as Horn is called king sometimes of one country , and sometimes of the other . In the French original , Westir is said to have been the old name of Hirland , or Ireland ; which , occasionally at least , is called Westnesse , in the translation , in which Britain is named Sudene ; but here , again , it is inconsistent and confused .</p>
   <p>“ It is , at any rate , highly probable , that the story , cited in the Complaynt of Scotland , was a romance of King Horn , whether prose or verse ; and , consequently , that Estmureland and Westmureland should there mean England and Ireland ; though it is possible that no other instance can be found of those two names occurring with the same sense . ”</p>
   <p>And they cast kevils them amang .— P . 4. v. 3 .</p>
   <p>Kevils — Lots . Both words originally meant only a portion , or share , of any thing .— Leges Burgorum , cap . 59 , de lot , cut , or kavil . Statuta Gildae , cap . 20 . Nullus emat lanam , &amp; c. nisi fuerit confrater Gildae , &amp; c. Neque lot neque cavil habeat cum aliquo confratre nostro . In both these laws , lot and cavil signify a share in trade .</p>
   <p>Dame , how does my gay goss hawk ?— P . 9. v. 1 .</p>
   <p>This metaphorical language was customary among the northern nations . In 925 , king Adelstein sent an embassy to Harald Harfagar , king of Norway , the chief of which presented that prince with an elegant sword , ornamented with precious stones . As it was presented by the point , the Norwegian chief , in receiving it , unwarily laid hold of the hilt . The English ambassador declared , in the name of his master , that he accepted the act as a deed of homage ; for , touching the hilt of a warrior 's sword was regarded as an acknowledgement of subjection . The Norwegian prince , resolving to circumvent his rival by a similar artifice , suppressed his resentment , and sent , next summer , an embassy to Adelstein , the chief of which presented Haco , the son of Harald , to the English prince ; and , placing him on his knees , made the following declaration :— “ Haraldus , Normannorum rex , amice te salutat ; albamque hunc avem , bene institutam mittit , utque melius deinceps erudias , postulat . ” The king received young Haco on his knees ; which the Norwegian ambassador immediately accepted , in the name of his master , as a declaration of inferiority ; according to the proverb , “ Is minor semper habetur , qui alterius filium educat . ” — Pontoppidani Vestigia Danor . Vol . II . p. 67 .</p>

   <p>KEMPION .</p>
   <p>NEVER BEFORE PUBLISHED</p>
   <p>The tale of Kempion seems , from the names of the personages , and the nature of the adventure , to have been an old metrical romance , degraded into a ballad , by the lapse of time , and the corruption of reciters . The change in the structure of the last verses , from the common ballad stanza , to that which is proper to the metrical romance , adds force to this conjecture .</p>
   <p>Such transformations , as the song narrates , are common in the annals of chivalry . In the 25th and 26th cantos of the second book of the Orlando Inamorato , the paladin , Brandimarte , after surmounting many obstacles , penetrates into the recesses of an enchanted palace . Here he finds a fair damsel , seated upon a tomb , who announces to him , that , in order to achieve her deliverance , he must raise the lid of the sepulchre , and kiss whatever being should issue forth . The knight , having pledged his faith , proceeds to open the tomb , out of which a monstrous snake issues forth , with a tremendous hiss . Brandimarte , with much reluctance , fulfils the bizarre conditions of the adventure ; and the monster is instantly changed into a beautiful Fairy , who loads her deliverer with benefits . For the satisfaction of those , who may wish to compare the tale of the Italian poet with that of Kempion , a part of the original of Boiardo is given below .<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span></p>
   <p>There is a ballad , somewhat resembling Kempion , called the Laidley Worm of Spindleston-heuch , which is very popular upon the borders ; but , having been often published , it was thought unnecessary to insert it in this collection . The most common version was either entirely composed , or re-written , by the Reverend Mr Lamb , of Norham .</p>
   <p>A similar tradition is , by Heywood and Delrio , said to have existed at Basil . A tailor , in an adventurous mood , chose to descend into an obscure cavern , in the vicinity of the city . After many windings , he came to an iron door , through which he passed into a splendid chamber . Here he found , seated upon a stately throne , a lady , whose countenance was surprisingly beautiful , but whose shape terminated in a dragon 's train , which wrapped around the chair on which she was placed . Before her stood a brazen chest , trebly barred and bolted ; at each end of which lay couched a huge black ban-dog , who rose up , as if to tear the intruder in pieces . But the lady appeased them ; and , opening the chest , displayed an immense treasure , out of which she bestowed upon the visitor some small pieces of money , informing him , that she was enchanted by her step-dame , but should recover her natural shape , on being kissed thrice by a mortal . The tailor assayed to fulfil the conditions of the adventure ; but her face assumed such an altered , wild , and grim expression , that his courage failed , and he was fain to fly from the place . A kinsman of his , some years after , penetrated into the cavern , with the purpose of repairing a desperate fortune . But , finding nothing but dead men 's bones , he ran mad , and died . Sir John Mandeville tells a similar story of a Grecian island .</p>
   <p>There are numerous traditions , upon the borders , concerning huge and destructive snakes , and also of a poisonous reptile called a man-keeper ; although the common adder , and blind worm , are the only reptiles of that genus now known to haunt our wilds . Whether it be possible , that , at an early period , before the country was drained , and cleared of wood , serpents of a larger size may have existed , is a question which the editor leaves to the naturalist . But , not to mention the fabulous dragon , slain in Northumberland by Sir Bevis , the fame still survives of many a preux chevalier , supposed to have distinguished himself by similar atchievements .</p>
   <p>The manor of Sockburne , in the bishopric of Durham , anciently the seat of the family of Conyers , or Cogniers , is held of the bishop by the service of presenting , or showing to him , upon his first entrance into his diocese , an antique sword , or faulchion . The origin of this peculiar service is thus stated in Beckwith 's edition of Blount 's Ancient Tenures , p. 200 .</p>
   <p>“ Sir Edward Blackett ( the proprietor of the manor ) now represents the person of Sir John Conyers , who , as tradition says , in the fields of Sockburne , slew , with this faulchion , a monstrous creature , a dragon , a worm , or flying serpent , that devoured men , women , and children . The then owner of Sockburne , as a reward for his bravery , gave him the manor , with its appurtenances , to hold for ever , on condition that he meets the lord bishop of Durham , with this faulchion , on his first entrance into his diocese , after his election to that see .</p>
   <p>“ And , in confirmation of this tradition , there is painted , in a window of Sockburne church , the faulchion we just now spoke of : and it is also cut in marble , upon the tomb of the great ancestor of the Conyers ’ , together with a dog , and the monstrous worm , or serpent , lying at his feet , of his own killing , of which the history of the family gives the above account .</p>
   <p>“ When the bishop first comes into his diocese , he crosses the river Tees , either at the ford at Nesham , or Croft-bridge , where the counties of York and Durham divide ; at one of which places Sir Edward Blackett , either in person , or by his representative , if the bishop comes by Nesham , rides into the middle of the river Tees , with the ancient faulchion drawn in his hand , or upon the middle of Croft-bridge ; and then presents the faulchion to the bishop , addressing him in the ancient form of words ; upon which the bishop takes the faulchion into his hand , looks at it , and returns it back again , wishing the lord of the manor his health , and the enjoyment of his estate . ” The faulchion , above alluded to , has upon its hilt the arms of England , in the reign of King John , and an eagle , supposed to be the ensign of Morcar , earl of Northumberland .— GOUGH 'S Camden 's Britannia , Vol . III . p. 114 . Mr Gough , with great appearance of probability , conjectures , the dragon , engraved on the tomb , to be an emblematical , or heraldric ornament .</p>
   <p>The property , called Pollard 's Lands , near Bishop Auckland , is held by a similar tenure ; and we are informed , in the work just quoted , that “ Dr Johnson of Newcastle met the present bishop , Dr Egerton , in September , 1771 , at his first arrival there , and presented a faulchion upon his knee , and addressed him in the old form of words , saying ,</p>
   <p>“ My lord , in behalf of myself , as well as of the several other tenants of Pollard 's Lands , I do humbly present your lordship with this faulchion , at your first coming here , wherewith , as the tradition goeth , Pollard slew of old a great and venomous serpent , which did much harm to man and beast : and , by the performance of this service , these lands are holden . ” — Ancient Tenures , p. 201 .</p>
   <p>Above the south entrance of the ancient parish church of Linton , in Roxburghshire , is a rude piece of sculpture , representing a knight , with a falcon on his arm , encountering with his lance , in full career , a sort of monster , which the common people call a worm , or snake . Tradition bears , that this animal inhabited a den , or hollow , at some distance from the church , whence it was wont to issue forth , and ravage the country , or , by the fascination of its eyes and breath , draw its prey into its jaws . Large rewards were in vain offered for the destruction of this monster , which had grown to so huge a bulk , that it used to twist itself , in spiral folds , round a green hillock of considerable height , still called Wormeston , and marked by a clump of trees . When sleeping in this place , with its mouth open , popular credulity affirms , that it was slain by the laird of Lariston , a man , brave even to madness , who , coming upon the snake at full gallop , thrust down its throat a peat ( a piece of turf dried for fuel ) , dipt in scalding pitch , and fixed to the point of his lance . The aromatic quality of the peat is said to have preserved the champion from the effects of the monster 's poisonous breath , while , at the same time , it clogged its jaws . In dying , the serpent contracted his folds with so much violence , that their spiral impression is still discernible round the hillock where it lay . The noble family of Somerville are said to be descended from this adventurous knight , in memory of whose atchievement , they bear a dragon as their crest .</p>
   <p>The sculpture itself gives no countenance to this fine story ; for the animal , whom the knight appears to be in the act of slaying , has no resemblance to a serpent , but rather to a wolf , or boar , with which the neighbouring Cheviot mountains must in early times have abounded ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>and there remain vestiges of another monster , of the same species , attacking the horse of the champion . An inscription , which might have thrown light upon this exploit , is now totally defaced . The vulgar , adapting it to their own tradition , tell us that it ran thus :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The wode laird of Lariestoun</l>
     <l n="2">Slew the wode worm of Wormiestoune ,</l>
     <l n="3">And wan all Linton paroschine .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It is most probable , that the animal , destroyed by the ancestor of Lord Somerville , was one of those beasts of prey , by which Caledonia was formerly infested ; but which , now ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Razed out of all her woods , as trophies hung ,</l>
     <l n="2">Grin high emblazon 'd on her children 's shields .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Since publishing the first edition of this work , I have found the following account of Somerville 's atchievement , in a MS. of some antiquity :</p>
   <p>“ John Somerville ( son to Roger de Somerville , baron of Whichenever , in Staffordshire ) was made , by King William ( the Lion ) , his principal falconer , and got from that king the lands and baronie of Linton , in Tiviotdale , for an extraordinarie and valiant action ; which , according to the manuscript of the family of Drum , was thus : In the parochen of Lintoun , within the sheriffdom of Roxburgh , there happened to breed a monster , in form of a serpent , or worme ; in length , three Scots yards , and somewhat bigger than an ordinarie man 's leg , with a head more proportionable to its length than greatness . It had its den in a hollow piece of ground , a mile south-east from Lintoun church ; it destroyed both men and beast that came in its way . Several attempts were made to destroy it , by shooting of arrows , and throwing of darts , none daring to approach so near as to make use of a sword or lance . John Somerville undertakes to kill it , and being well mounted , and attended with a stout servant , he cam , before the sun-rising , before the dragon 's den , having prepared some long , small , and hard peats ( bog-turf dried for fuel ) , be-dabbed with pitch , rosette , and brimstone , fixed with small wire upon a wheel , at the point of his lance : these , being touched with fire , would instantly break out into flames ; and , there being a breath of air , that served to his purpose , about the sun-rising , the serpent , dragon , or worme , so called by tradition , appeared with her head , and some part of her body , without the den ; whereupon his servant set fire to the peats upon the wheel , at the top of the lance , and John Somerville , advancing with a full gallop , thrust the same with the wheel , and a great part of the lance , directly into the serpent 's mouthe , which wente down its throat , into the belly , and was left there , the lance breaking by the rebounding of the horse , and giving a deadly wound to the dragoun ; for which action he was knighted by King William ; and his effigies was cut in ston in the posture he performed this actione , and placed above the principal church door of Lintoun , where it is yet to be seen , with his name and sirname : and the place , where this monster was killed , is at this day called , by the common people , who have the foresaid story by tradition , the Wormes Glen . And further to perpetuate this actione , the barons of Lintoun , Cowthally , and Drum , did always carry for crest , a wheel , and thereon a dragoun . ” Extracted from a genealogical MS. in the Advocates ’ Library , written about 1680 . The falcon on the champion 's arm , in the monument , may be supposed to allude to his office of falconer to William of Scotland .</p>
   <p>The ballad of Kempion is given chiefly from Mrs Brown 's MS ., with corrections from a recited fragment .</p>

   <p>If by Estmere crags we are to understand the rocky cliffs of Northumberland , in opposition to Westmoreland , we may bring our scene of action near Bamborough , and thereby almost identify the tale of Kempion with that of the Laidley Worm of Spindleston , to which it bears so strong a resemblance .</p>
   <p>I weird ye to a fiery beast .— P . 26. v. 3 .</p>
   <p>Our ideas of dragons and serpents are probably derived from the Scandinavians . The legends of Regnar Lodbrog , and of the huge snake in the Edda , by whose folds the world is encircled , are well known . Griffins and dragons were fabled , by the Danes , as watching over , and defending , hoards of gold .— Bartholin . de caus . cont . mortis , p. 490 . Saxo Grammaticus , lib . 2 . The Edda also mentions one Fafner , who , transformed into a serpent , brooded over his hidden treasures . From these authorities , and that of Herodotus , our Milton draws his simile —</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Warwolf , or Lycanthropus , signifies a magician , possessing the power of transforming himself into a wolf , for the purpose of ravage and devastation . It is probable the word was first used symbolically , to distinguish those , who , by means of intoxicating herbs , could work their passions into a frantic state , and throw themselves upon their enemies with the fury and temerity of ravenous wolves . Such were the noted Berserker of the Scandinavians , who , in their fits of voluntary frenzy , were wont to perform the most astonishing exploits of strength , and to perpetrate the most horrible excesses , although , in their natural state , they neither were capable of greater crimes nor exertions than ordinary men . This quality they ascribed to Odin . “ Odinus efficere valuit , ut hostes ipsius inter bellandum caeci vel surdi vel attoniti fierent , armaque illorum instar baculorum obtusa essent . Sui vero milites sine loricis incedebant , ac instar canum vel luporum furebant , scuta sua arrodentes : et robusti ut ursi vel tauri , adversarios trucidabant : ipsis vero neque ignis neque ferrum nocuit . Ea qualitas vocatur furor Berserkicus . ” — Snorro Sturleson , quoted by Bartholin . de causis contemptae mortis , p. 344 . For a fuller account of these frantic champions , see the Hervorar Saga published by Suhm ; also the Christni Saga , and most of the ancient Norwegian histories and romances . Camden explains the tales of the Irish , concerning men transformed into wolves , upon nearly the same principle .— GOUGH 'S edition of Camden 's Britannia , Vol . III . p. 520 .</p>
   <p>But , in process of time , the transformation into a wolf was believed to be real , and to affect the body as well as the mind ; and to such transformations our faithful Gervase of Tilbury bears evidence , as an eye-witness . “ Vidimus frequenter in Anglia per lunationes homines in lupos mutari , quod hominum genus Gerulfos Galli vocunt , Angli vero WER-WLF dicunt . WER enim Anglice virum sonat , WLF lupum . ” Ot . Imp . De oculis apertis post peccatum . The learned commentators , upon the art of sorcery , differ widely concerning the manner in which the arch fiend effects this change upon the persons of his vassals ; whether by surrounding their bodies with a sort of pellice of condensed air , having the form of an wolf ; or whether by some delusion , affecting the eyes of the spectators ; or , finally , by an actual corporeal transformation . The curious reader may consult Delrii Disquisitiones Magicae , p. 188 ; and ( if he pleases ) Evvichius de natura Sagarum .— Fincelius , lib . 2. de Mirac .— Remigius . lib . 2. de Daemonolat .— Binsfeld . de confession , maleficarum . Not to mention Spondanus , Bodinus , Peucerus , Philippus Camerarius , Condronchus , Petrus Thyraeus , Bartholomeus Spineus , Sir George Mackenzie , and King James I ., with the sapient Monsieur Oufle of Bayle . The editor presumes , it is only since the extirpation of wolves , that our British sorceresses have adopted the disguise of hares , cats , and such more familiar animals .</p>
   <p>A wild story of a warwolf , or rather a war-bear , is told in Torfoeus ’ History of Hrolfe Kraka . As the original is a scarce book , little known in this country , some readers may be interested by a short analysis of the tale .</p>
   <p>Hringo , king of Upland , had an only son , called Biorno , the most beautiful and most gallant of the Norwegian youth . At an advanced period of life , the king became enamoured of a “ witch lady , ” whom he chose for his second wife . A mutual and tender affection had , from infancy , subsisted betwixt Biorno , and Bera , the lovely daughter of an ancient warrior . But the new queen cast upon her step-son an eye of incestuous passion ; to gratify which , she prevailed upon her husband , when he set out upon one of those piratical expeditions , which formed the summer campaign of a Scandinavian monarch , to leave the prince at home . In the absence of Hringo , she communicated to Biorno her impure affection , and was repulsed with disdain and violence . The rage of the weird step-mother was boundless . “ Hence to the woods ! ” she exclaimed , striking the prince with a glove of wolf-skin ; “ Hence to the woods ! subsist only on thy father 's herds ; live pursuing , and die pursued ! ” From this time the prince Biorno was no more seen , and the herdsmen of the king 's cattle soon observed , that astonishing devastation was nightly made among their flocks , by a black bear , of immense size , and unusual ferocity . Every attempt to snare or destroy this animal was found vain ; and much was the unavailing regret for the absence of Biorno , whose delight had been in extirpating beasts of prey . Bera , the faithful mistress of the young prince , added her tears to the sorrow of the people . As she was indulging her melancholy , apart from society , she was alarmed by the approach of the monstrous bear , which was the dread of the whole country . Unable to escape , she waited its approach , in expectation of instant death ; when , to her astonishment , the animal fawned upon her , rolled himself at her feet , and regarded her with eyes , in which , spite of the horrible transformation , she still recognized the glances of her lost lover . Bera had the courage to follow the bear to his cavern , where , during certain hours , the spell permitted him to resume his human shape . Her love overcame her repugnance at so strange a mode of life , and she continued to inhabit the cavern of Biorno , enjoying his society during the periods of his freedom from enchantment . One day , looking sadly upon his wife , “ Bera , ” said the prince , “ the end of my life approaches . My flesh will soon serve for the repast of my father and his courtiers . But , do thou beware lest either the threats or entreaties of my diabolical step-mother induce thee to partake of the horrid banquet . So shalt thou safely bring forth three sons , who shall be the wonder of the North . ” The spell now operated , and the unfortunate prince sallied from his cavern to prowl among the herds . Bera followed him , weeping , and at a distance . The clamour of the chace was now heard . It was the old king , who , returned from his piratical excursion , had collected a strong force to destroy the devouring animal which ravaged his country . The poor bear defended himself gallantly , slaying many dogs , and some huntsmen . At length , wearied out , he sought protection at the feet of his father . But his supplicating gestures were in vain , and the eyes of paternal affection proved more dull than those of love . Biorno died by the lance of his father , and his flesh was prepared for the royal banquet . Bera was recognised , and hurried into the queen 's presence . The sorceress , as Biorno had predicted , endeavoured to prevail upon Bera to eat of what was then esteemed a regal dainty . Entreaties and threats being in vain , force was , by the queen 's command , employed for this purpose , and Bera was compelled to swallow one morsel of the bear 's flesh . A second was put into her mouth , but she had an opportunity of putting it aside . She was then dismissed to her father 's house . Here , in process of time , she was delivered of three sons , two of whom were affected variously , in person and disposition , by the share their mother had been compelled to take in the feast of the king . The eldest , from his middle downwards , resembled an elk , whence he derived the name of Elgfrod . He proved a man of uncommon strength , but of savage manners , and adopted the profession of a robber . Thorer , the second son of Bera , was handsome and well shaped , saving that he had the foot of a dog ; from which he obtained the appellation of Houndsfoot . But Bodvar , the third son , was a model of perfection in mind and body . He revenged upon the necromantic queen the death of his father , and became the most celebrated champion of his age .</p>

   <p>LORD THOMAS AND FAIR ANNIE .</p>
   <p>NOW</p>
   <p>FIRST PUBLISHED IN A PERFECT STATE .</p>
   <p>This ballad is now , for the first time , published in a perfect state . A fragment , comprehending the 2d , 4th , 5th , and 6th verses , as also the 17th , has appeared in several collections . The present copy is chiefly taken from the recitation of an old woman , residing near Kirkhill , in West Lothian ; the same from whom were obtained the variations in the tale of Tamlane , and the fragment of the Wife of Usher 's Well , which is the next in order .</p>
   <p>The tale is much the same with the Breton romance , called Lay le Frain , or the Song of the Ash . Indeed , the editor is convinced , that the farther our researches are extended , the more we shall see ground to believe , that the romantic ballads of later times are , for the most part , abridgments of the ancient metrical romances , narrated in a smoother stanza , and more modern language . A copy of the ancient romance , alluded to , is preserved in the invaluable collection ( W. 4 . 1 . ) of the Advocates ’ Library , and begins thus :</p>

    <head>THE WIFE OF USHER 'S WELL .</head>
     <l n="1">I wish the wind may never cease , &amp; c .— P. 46. v. 2 .</l>

   <p>The sense of this verse is obscure , owing , probably , to corruption by reciters . It would appear , that the mother had sinned in the same degree with the celebrated Lenore .</p>
   <p>And their hats were o ’ the birk .— P . 46. v. 3 .</p>
   <p>The notion , that the souls of the blessed wear garlands , seems to be of Jewish origin . At least , in the Maase-book , there is a Rabbinical tradition , to the following effect :—</p>
   <p>“ It fell out , that a Jew , whose name was Ponim , an ancient man , whose business was altogether about the dead , coming to the door of the school , saw one standing there , who had a garland upon his head . Then was Rabbi Ponim afraid , imagining it was a spirit . Whereupon he , whom the Rabbi saw , called out to him , saying , ‘ Be not afraid , but pass forward . Dost thou not know me ? ’ Then said Rabbi Ponim , ‘ Art not thou he whom I buried yesterday ? ’ And he was answered , ‘ Yea , I am he . ’ Upon which Rabbi Ponim said , ‘ Why comest thou hither ? How fareth it with thee in the other world ? ’ And the apparition made answer , ‘ It goeth well with me , and I am in high esteem in paradise . ’ Then said the Rabbi , ‘ Thou wert but looked upon in the world as an insignificant Jew . What good work didst thou do , that thou art thus esteemed ? ’ The apparition answered , ‘ I will tell thee : the reason of the esteem I am in , is , that I rose every morning early , and with fervency uttered my prayer , and offered the grace from the bottom of my heart : for which reason I now pronounce grace in paradise , and am well respected . If thou doubtest whether I am the person , I will show thee a token that shall convince thee of it . Yesterday , when thou didst clothe me in my funeral attire , thou didst tear my sleeve . ’ Then asked Rabbi Ponim , ‘ What is the meaning of that garland ? ’ The apparition answered , ‘ I wear it , to the end the wind of the world may not have power over me ; for it consists of excellent herbs of paradise . ’ Then did Rabbi Ponim mend the sleeve of the deceased : for the deceased had said , that if it was not mended , he should be ashamed to be seen amongst others , whose apparel was whole . And then the apparition vanished . Wherefore , let every one utter his prayer with fervency ; for then it shall go well with him in the other world . And let care be taken that no rent , nor tearing , be left in the apparel in which the deceased are interred . ” — Jewish Traditions , abridged from Buxtorf , London , 1732 , Vol . II . p. 19 .</p>

   <p>THE ANCIENT COPY .</p>
   <p>This ballad is edited from the MS. of Mrs Brown , corrected by a recited fragment . A modernized copy has been published , under the title of “ Courteous King Jamie . ” — Tales of Wonder , Vol . II . p. 451 .</p>
   <p>The legend will remind the reader of the “ Marriage of Sir Gawain , ” in the Reliques of Ancient Poetry , and of the “ Wife of Bath 's Tale , ” in Father Chaucer . But the original , as appears from the following quotation from Torfoeus , is to be found in an Icelandic Saga :</p>
   <p>“ Hellgius , Rex Daniae , moerore ob amissam conjugem vexatus , solus agebat , et subducens se hominum commercio , segregem domum , omnis famulitii impatiens , incolebat . Accidit autem , ut nocte concubia , lamentabilis cujusdam ante fores ejulantis sonus auribus ejus obreperet . Expergefactus igitur , recluso ostio , informe quoddam mulieris simulacrum , “ habitu corporis foedum , veste squalore obsita , pallore , macie frigorisque tyrannide prope modum peremptum , deprehendit ; quod precibus obsecratus , ut qui jam miserorum aerumnas ex propria calamitate pensare didicisset , in domum intromisit ; ipse lectum petit . At mulier , ne hac quidem benignitate contenta , thori consortium obnixe flagitabat , addens id tanti referre , ut nisi impetraret , omnino sibi moriendum esset . Quod , ea lege , ne ipsum attingeret , concessum est . Ideo nec complexu eam dignatus rex , avertit sese . Cum autem prima luce forte oculos ultro citroque converteret , eximiae formae virginem lecto receptam animadvertit ; quae statim ipsi placere coepit : causam igitur tam repentinae mutationis curiosius indaganti , respondit virgo , se unam e subterraneorum hominum genere diris novercalibus devotam , tam tetra et execrabili specie , quali primo comparuit , damnatam , quoad thori cujusdam principis socia fieret , multos reges hac de re sollicitasse . Jam actis pro praestito beneficio gratiis , discessum maturans , a rege formae ejus illecebris capto comprimitur . Deinde petit , si prolem ex hoc congressu progigni contigerit , sequente hyeme , eodem anni tempore , ante fores positam in aedes reciperet , seque ejus patrem profiteri non gravaretur , secus non leve infortunium insecuturum praedixit : a quo praecepto cum rex postea exorbitasset , nec prae foribus jacentem infantem pro suo agnoscere voluisset , ad eum iterum , sed corrugata fronte , accessit , obque violatam fidem acrius objurgatum ab imminente periculo , praestiti olim beneficii gratia , exempturam pollicebatur , ita tamen ut tota ultionis rabies in filium ejus “ effusa graves aliquando levitatis illius paenas exigeret . Ex hac tam dissimilium naturarum commixtione , Skulda , versuti et versatilis animi mulier , nata fuisse memoratur ; quae utramque naturam participans prodigiosorum operum effectrix perhibetur . ” — Hrolffi Krakii , Hist . p. 49 , Hafn . 1715 .</p>

   <p>ANNAN WATER .</p>
   <p>NEVER BEFORE PUBLISHED .</p>
   <p>The following verses are the original words of the tune of “ Allan Water , ” by which name the song is mentioned in Ramsay 's Tea Table Miscellany . The ballad is given from tradition ; and it is said , that a bridge , over the Annan , was built in consequence of the melancholy catastrophe which it narrates . Two verses are added in this edition , from another copy of the ballad , in which the conclusion proves fortunate . By the Gatehope Slack , is perhaps meant the Gate Slack , a pass in Annandale . The Annan , and the Frith of Solway , into which it falls , are the frequent scenes of tragical accidents . The editor trusts he will be pardoned for inserting the following awfully impressive account of such an event , contained in a letter from Dr Currie , of Liverpool , by whose correspondence , while in the course of preparing these volumes for the press , he has been alike honoured and instructed . After stating , that he had some recollection of the ballad which follows , the biographer of Burns proceeds thus : “ I once in my early days heard ( for it was night , and I could not see ) a traveller drowning ; not in the Annan itself , but in the Frith of Solway , close by the mouth of that river . The influx of the tide had unhorsed him , in the night , as he was passing the sands from Cumberland . The west wind blew a tempest , and , according to the common expression , brought in the water , three foot a-breast . The traveller got upon a standing net , a little way from the shore . There he lashed himself to the post , shouting for half an hour for assistance — till the tide rose over his head ! In the darkness of night , and amid the pauses of the hurricane , his voice , heard at intervals , was exquisitely mournful . No one could go to his assistance — no one knew where he was — the sound seemed to proceed from the spirit of the waters . But morning rose — the tide had ebbed — and the poor traveller was found lashed to the pole of the net , and bleaching in the wind . ”</p>

    <head>THE CRUEL SISTER .</head>
    <head>This ballad differs essentially from that which has been published in various collections , under the title of Binnorie . It is compiled from a copy in Mrs Brown 's MSS ., intermixed with a beautiful fragment , of fourteen verses , transmitted to the editor by J. C. Walker , Esq . the ingenious historian of the Irish bards . Mr Walker , at the same time , favoured the editor with the following note :— “ I am indebted to my departed friend , Miss Brook , for the foregoing pathetic fragment . Her account of it was as follows : This song was transcribed , several years ago , from the memory of an old woman , who had no recollection of the concluding verses : probably the beginning may also be lost , as it seems to commence abruptly . ” The first verse and burden of the fragment run thus :—</head>
     <l n="1">O sister , sister , reach thy hand !</l>
     <l n="2">Hey ho , my Nanny , O ;</l>
     <l n="3">And you shall be heir of all my land ,</l>
     <l n="4">While the swan swims bonny , O .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The first part of this chorus seems to be corrupted from the common burden of Hey , Nonny , Nonny , alluded to in the song , beginning , “ Sigh no more , ladye . ” The chorus , retained in this edition , is the most common and popular ; but Mrs Brown 's copy bears a yet different burden , beginning thus :—</p>

   <p>THE QUEEN 'S MARIE .</p>
   <p>NEVER BEFORE PUBLISHED .</p>
   <p>“ In the very time of the General Assembly , there comes to public knowledge a haynous murther , committed in the court ; yea , not far from the queen 's lap : for a French woman , that served in the queen 's chamber , had played the whore with the queen 's own apothecary .— The woman conceived and bare a childe , whom , with common consent , the father and mother murthered ; yet were the cries of a new-borne childe hearde , searche was made , the childe and the mother were both apprehended , and so was the man and the woman condemned to be hanged in the publicke street of Edinburgh .— The punishment was suitable , because the crime was haynous . But yet was not the court purged of whores and whoredoms , which was the fountaine of such enormities ; for it was well known that shame hasted marriage betwixt John Sempill , called the Dancer , and Mary Leringston<span type="note_anchor">[ 20 ]</span>, sirnamed the Lusty . What bruit the Maries , and the rest of the dancers of the court had , the ballads of that age do witnesse , which we , for modestie 's sake , omit : but this was the common complaint of all godly and wise men , that , if they thought such a court could long continue , and if they looked for no better life to come , they would have wished their sonnes and daughters rather to have been brought up with fiddlers and dancers , and to have been exercised with flinging upon a floore , and in the rest that thereof followes , than to have been exercised in the company of the godly , and exercised in virtue , which , in that court was hated , and filthenesse not only maintained , but also rewarded ; witnesse the abbey of Abercorne , the barony of Auchvermuchtie , and divers others , pertaining to the patrimony of the crown , given in heritage to skippers and dancers , and dalliers with dames . This was the beginning of the regiment of Mary , queen of Scots , and these were the fruits that she brought forth of France .— Lord ! look on our miseries ! and deliver us from the wickednesse of this corrupt court ! ” — KNOX 's History of the Reformation , p. 373-4 .</p>
   <p>Such seems to be the subject of the following ballad , as narrated by the stern apostle of presbytery . It will readily strike the reader , that the tale has suffered great alterations , as handed down by tradition ; the French waiting-woman being changed into Mary Hamilton ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 21 ]</span>and the queen 's apothecary , into Henry Darnley . Yet this is less surprising , when we recollect , that one of the heaviest of the queen 's complaints against her ill-fated husband , was his infidelity , and that even with her personal attendants . I have been enabled to publish the following complete edition of the ballad , by copies from various quarters ; that principally used , was communicated to me , in the most polite manner , by Mr Kirkpatricke Sharpe , of Hoddom , to whom I am indebted for many similar favours .</p>

    <head>ON</head>
    <head>THE QUEEN 'S MARIE .</head>
     <l n="1">When she cam to the Netherbow port .— P . 93 , v. 1 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The Netherbow port was the gate which divided the city of Edinburgh from the suburb , called the Canongate . It had towers and a spire , which formed a fine termination to the view from the Cross . The gate was pulled down , in one of those fits of rage for indiscriminate destruction , with which the magistrates of a corporation are sometimes visited .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Yestreen the queen had four Maries ,</l>
     <l n="2">The night she 'll hae but three , &amp; c .— P. 93. v. 2 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The queen 's Maries were four young ladies of the highest families in Scotland , who were sent to France in her train , and returned with her to Scotland . They are mentioned by Knox , in the quotation introductory to this ballad . Keith gives us their names , p. 55 . “ The young queen , Mary , embarked at Dunbarton for France , ... and with her went ..., and four young virgins , all of the name of Mary , viz . Livingston , Fleming , Seaton , and Beatoun . ” The queen 's Maries are mentioned again by the same author , p. 288 , and 291 , in the note . Neither Mary Livingston , nor Mary Fleming , are mentioned in the ballad ; nor are the Mary Hamilton , and Mary Carmichael , of the ballad mentioned by Keith . But if this corps continued to consist of young virgins , as when originally raised , it could hardly have subsisted without occasional recruits ; especially if we trust our old bard , and John Knox .</p>

    <head>THE BONNY HYND .</head>
     <l n="1">From Mr HERD 's MS ., where the following Note is prefixed to</l>
     <l n="2">it — “ Copied from the mouth of a Milkmaid , 1771 , by W. L . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It was originally the intention of the Editor to have omitted this ballad , on account of the disagreeable nature of the subject . Upon consideration , however , it seemed a fair sample of a certain class of songs and tales , turning upon incidents the most horrible and unnatural , with which the vulgar in Scotland are greatly delighted , and of which they have current amongst them an ample store . Such , indeed , are the subjects of composition in most nations , during the early period of society ; when the feelings , rude and callous , can only be affected by the strongest stimuli , and where the mind does not , as in a more refined age , recoil , disgusted , from the means by which interest has been excited . Hence incest , parricide — crimes , in fine , the foulest and most enormous , were the early themes of the Grecian muse . Whether that delicacy , which precludes the modern bard from the choice of such impressive and dreadful themes , be favourable to the higher classes of poetic composition , may perhaps be questioned ; but there can be little doubt , that the more important cause of virtue and morality is advanced by this exclusion . The knowledge , that enormities are not without precedent , may promote , and even suggest , them . Hence , the publication of the Newgate Register has been prohibited by the wisdom of the legislature ; having been found to encourage those very crimes , of which it recorded the punishment . Hence , too , the wise maxim of the Romans , Facinora ostendi dum puniantur , flagitia autem abscondi debent .</p>
   <p>The ballad has a high degree of poetical merit .</p>

   <p>THE SOUTERS OF SELKIRK .</p>
   <p>This little lyric piece , with those which immediately follow in the collection , relates to the fatal battle of Flodden , in which the flower of the Scottish nobility fell around their sovereign , James IV .</p>
   <p>The ancient and received tradition of the burgh of Selkirk affirms , that the citizens of that town distinguished themselves by their gallantry on that disastrous occasion . Eighty in number , and headed by their town-clerk , they joined their monarch on his entrance into England . James , pleased with the appearance of this gallant troop , knighted their leader , William Brydone , upon the field of battle , from which few of the men of Selkirk were destined to return . They distinguished themselves in the conflict , and were almost all slain . The few survivors , on their return home , found , by the side of Lady-Wood Edge , the corpse of a female , wife to one of their fallen comrades , with a child sucking at her breast . In memory of this latter event , continues the tradition , the present arms of the burgh bear , a female , holding a child in her arms , and seated on a sarcophagus , decorated with the Scottish lion ; in the back-ground a wood .</p>
   <p>A learned antiquary , whose judgment and accuracy claim respect , has made some observations upon the probability of this tradition , which the editor shall take the liberty of quoting , as an introduction to what he has to offer upon the same subject . And , if he shall have the misfortune to differ from the learned gentleman , he will at least lay candidly before the public the grounds of his opinion .</p>
   <p>“ That the souters of Selkirk should , in 1513 , amount to fourscore fighting men , is a circumstance utterly incredible . It is scarcely to be supposed , that all the shoemakers in Scotland could have produced such an army , at a period when shoes must have been still less worn than they are at present . Dr Johnson , indeed , was told at Aberdeen , that the people learned the art of making shoes from Cromwell 's soldiers .— ‘ The numbers , ’ he adds , ‘ that go barefoot , are still sufficient to show that shoes may be spared : they are not yet considered as necessaries of life ; for tall boys , not otherwise meanly dressed , run without them in the streets ; and , in the islands , the sons of gentlemen pass several of their first years with naked feet . ’ — ( Journey to the Western Islands , p . 55 . ) Away , then , with the fable of the souters of Selkirk . Mr Tytler , though he mentions it as the subject of a song , or ballad , ‘ does not remember ever to have seen the original genuine words , ’ — as he obligingly acknowledged in a letter to the editor . Mr Robertson , however , who gives the statistical account of the parish of Selkirk , seems to know something more of the matter — ‘ Some , ’ says he , ‘ have very falsely attributed to this event ( the battle of Flowden ) , that song ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Up wi ’ the souters of Selkirk ,</l>
     <l n="2">‘ And down with the Earl of Hume . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ There was no Earl of Hume , ’ he adds , ‘ at that time , nor was this song composed till long after . It arose from a bet betwixt the Philiphaugh and Hume families ; the souters ( or shoemakers ) of Selkirk , against the men of Hume , at a match of foot-ball , in which the souters of Selkirk completely gained , and afterwards perpetuated their victory in that song . ’ — This is decisive ; and so much for Scottish tradition . ” — Note to Historical Essay on Scotish Song , prefixed to Scotish Songs in 2 vols . 1794 .</p>
   <p>It is proper to remark , that the passage of Mr Robertson 's statistical account , above quoted , does not relate to the authenticity of the tradition , but to the origin of the song , which is obviously a separate and distinct question . The entire passage in the statistical account ( of which a part only is quoted in the essay ) runs thus :</p>
   <p>“ Here , too , the inhabitants of the town of Selkirk , who breathed the manly spirit of real freedom , justly merit particular attention . Of one hundred citizens , who followed the fortunes of James IV . on the plains of Flowden , a few returned , loaded with the spoils taken from the enemy . Some of these trophies still survive the rust of time , and the effects of negligence . The desperate valour of the citizens of Selkirk , which , on that fatal day , was eminently conspicuous to both armies , produced very opposite effects . The implacable resentment of the English reduced their defenceless town to ashes ; while their grateful sovereign ( James V .) showed his sense of their valour , by a grant of an extensive portion of the forest , the trees for building their houses , and the property as the reward of their heroism . ” — A note is added by Mr Robertson .— “ A standard , the appearance of which bespeaks its antiquity , is still carried annually ( on the day of riding their common ) by the corporation of weavers , by a member of which it was taken from the English in the field of Flowden . It may be added , that the sword of William Brydone , the town clerk , who led the citizens to the battle ( and who is said to have been knighted for his valour ) , is still in the possession of John Brydon , a citizen of Selkirk , his lineal descendant . ” — An additional note contains the passage quoted in the Essay on Scotish Song .</p>
   <p>If the testimony of Mr Robertson is to be received as decisive of the question , the learned author of the essay will surely admit , upon re-perusal , that the passage in the statistical account contains the most positive and unequivocal declaration of his belief in the tradition .</p>
   <p>Neither does the story itself , upon close examination , contain any thing inconsistent with probability . The towns upon the border , and especially Selkirk and Jedburgh , were inhabited by a race of citizens , who , from the necessity of their situation , and from the nature of their possessions ( held by burgage tenure ) , were inured to the use of arms . Selkirk was a county town , and a royal burgh ; and when the array of the kingdom , amounting to no less than one hundred thousand warriors , was marshalled by the royal command , eighty men seems no unreasonable proportion from a place of consequence , lying so very near the scene of action .</p>
   <p>Neither is it necessary to suppose , literally , that the men of Selkirk were all souters . This appellation was obviously bestowed on them , because it was the trade most generally practised in the town , and therefore passed into a general epithet . Even the existence of such a craft , however , is accounted improbable by the learned essayist , who seems hardly to allow , that the Scottish nation was , at that period , acquainted with the art “ of accommodating their feet with shoes . ” And here he attacks us with our own weapons , and wields the tradition of Aberdeen against that of Selkirk . We shall not stop to enquire , in what respect Cromwell 's regiment of missionary cobblers deserves , in point of probability , to take precedence of the souters of Selkirk . But , allowing that all the shoemakers in England , with Praise-the-Lord Barebones at their head , had generously combined to instruct the men of Aberdeen in the arts of psalmody and cobbling , it by no means bears upon the present question . If instruction was at all necessary , it must have been in teaching the natives how to make shoes , properly so called , in opposition to brogues : For there were cordiners in Aberdeen long before Cromwell 's visit , and several fell in the battle of the bridge of Dee , as appears from Spalding 's History of the Troubles in Scotland , Vol . II . p. 140 . Now , the “ single-soaled shoon , ” made by the souters of Selkirk , were a sort of brogues , with a single thin soal ; the purchaser himself performing the further operation of sewing on another of thick leather . The rude and imperfect state of this manufacture sufficiently evinces the antiquity of the craft . Thus , the profession of the citizens of Selkirk , instead of invalidating , confirms the traditional account of their valour .</p>
   <p>The total devastation of this unfortunate burgh , after the fatal battle of Flodden , is ascertained by the charters under which the corporation hold their privileges . The first of these is granted by James V ., and is dated 4th March , 1535-6 . The narrative , or inductive clause of the deed , is in these words : “ Sciatis quia nos considerantes et intelligentes quod Carte Evidencie et litere veteris fundacionis et infeofamenti burgi nostri de Selkirk et libertatum ejusdem burgensibus et communitati ipsius per nobilissimos progenitores nostros quorum animabus propicietur Deus dat . et concess . per guerrarum assultus pestem combustionem et alias pro majore parte vastantur et distruuntur unde mercantiarum usus inter ipsos burgenses cessavit in eorum magnam lesionem ac reipublice et libertatis Burgi nostri antedict . destruccionem et prejudicium ac ingens nobis dampnum penes nostras Custumas et firmas burgales et eodem nobis debit . si subitumin eisdem remedium minime habitum fuerit NOS igitur pietati et justicia moti ac pro policia et edificiis infra regnum nostrum habend . de novo infeodamus , ” &amp; c. The charter proceeds , in common form , to erect anew the town of Selkirk into a royal burgh , with all the privileges annexed to such corporations . This mark of royal favour was confirmed by a second charter , executed by the same monarch , after he had attained the age of majority , and dated April 8 , 1538 . This deed of confirmation first narrates the charter , which has been already quoted , and then proceeds to mention other grants , which had been conferred upon the burgh , during the minority of James V ., and which are thus expressed : “ We for the gude trew and thankful service done and to be done to ws be owre lovittis the baillies burgesses and communite of our burgh of Selkirk and for certaine otheris reasonable causis and considerationis moving ws be the tennor hereof grantis and gevis license to thame and thair successors to ryfe out breke and teil yeirlie ane thousand<span type="note_anchor">[ 23 ]</span>acres of thair common landis of our said burgh in what part thairof thea pleas for polecy strengthing and bigging of the samyn for the wele of ws and of liegis repairand thairto and defence againis owre auld innemyis of Ingland and other wayis and will and grantis that thai sall nocht be callit accusit nor incur ony danger or skaith thairthrow in thair personis landis nor gudis in ony wise in time cuming NOCHTWITHSTANDING ony owre actis or statutis maid or to be maid in the contrar in ony panys contenit tharein anent the quhilkis we dispens with thame be thir owre letters with power to them to occupy the saidis landis with thare awne gudis or to set theme to tenentis as thai sall think maist expedient for the wele of our said burgh with frei ische and entri and with all and sindry utheris commoditeis freedomes asiamentis and richtuis pertinentis whatsumever pertenyng or that rychtuisly may pertene thairto perpetually in tyme cuming frelie quietlie wele and in peace but ony revocatioun or agane calling whatsumever Gevin under owre signet and subscrivit with owre hand at Striveling the twenty day of Junii The yere of God ane thousand five hundreth and thretty six yeris and of our regne the twenti thre yere . ” Here follows another grant : “ We UNDERSTANDING that owre burgh of Selkirk and inhabitants thairof CONTINUALIE SEN THE FIELD OF FLODOUNE hes been oppressiit heriit and owre runin be theves and traitors whairthrow the hant of merchandice has cessit amangis thame of langtyme bygane and thai heriit thairthrow and we defraudit of owre custumis and dewites THAIRFOR and for divers utheris resonable causis and considerationes moving us be the tenor heirof of our kinglie power fre motive and autorite ryall grantis and gevis to thame and thair successors ane fair day begynand at the feist of the Conception of owre Lady next to cum aftere the day of the date hereof and be the octavis of the sammyn perpetualy in time cuming To be usit and exercit be thame als frelie in time cuming as ony uther fair is usit or exercit be ony otheris owre burrowis within our realme payand yeirlie custumis and doweities aucht and wont as effeiris frelie quietlie wele and in pece but ony revocation obstakill impediment or agane calling whatsumever subscrivet with owre hand and gevin under owre Signet at KIRKCALDY the secund day of September The yere of God ane thousand five huudreth and threty sex yeris and of our regne the twenty three yeir . ” The charter of confirmation , in which all these deeds and letters of donation are engrossed , proceeds to ratify and confirm them in the most ample manner . The testing clause , as it is termed in law language , is in these words : “ In cujus rei Testimonium huic presente carte nostre confirmationis magnum sigillum nostrum apponi precepimus TESTIBUS Reverendissimo reverendisque in Christo Patribus Gawino Archiepisco Glasguen . Cancellario nostro Georgio Episcopo Dunkelden . Henrico Episcopo Candide Case nostreque Capelle regie Strivilengen . dilectis nostris consanguineis Jacobo Moravie Comite &amp; c.

   <p>From these extracts , which are accurately copied from the original charters ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 24 ]</span>it may be safely concluded , 1st , that Selkirk was a place of importance before it was ruined by the English ; and , 2d , “ that the voice of merchants had ceased in her streets , ” in consequence of the fatal field of Flodden . But further , it seems reasonable to infer , that so many marks of royal favour , granted within so short a time of each other , evince the gratitude , as well as the compassion , of the monarch , and were intended to reward the valour , as well as to relieve the distress , of the men of Selkirk . Thus , every circumstance of the written evidence , as far as it goes , tallies with the oral tradition of the inhabitants ; and , therefore , though the latter may be exaggerated , it surely cannot be dismissed as entirely void of foundation . That William Brydone actually enjoyed the honour of knighthood , is ascertained by many of the deeds , in which his name appears as a notary public . John Brydone , lineal descendant of the gallant town-clerk , is still alive , and possessed of the reliques mentioned by Mr Robertson . The old man , though in an inferior station of life , receives considerable attention from his fellow-citizens , and claims no small merit to himself on account of his brave ancestor .</p>
   <p>Thus far concerning the tradition of the exploits of the men of Selkirk , at Flodden field . Whether the following verses do , or do not , bear any allusion to that event , is a separate and less interesting question . The opinion of Mr Robertson , referring them to a different origin , has been already mentioned ; but his authority , though highly respectable , is not absolutely decisive of the question .</p>
   <p>The late Mr Plummer , sheriff-depute of the county of Selkirk , a faithful and accurate antiquary , entertained a very opposite opinion . He has thus expressed himself , upon the subject , in the course of his literary correspondence with Mr Herd :</p>
   <p>“ Of the Souters of Selkirk , I never heard any words but the following verse :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Up with the Sutors of Selkirk ,</l>
     <l n="2">‘ And down wi ’ the Earl of Home ;</l>
     <l n="3">‘ And up wi ’ a ’ the bra ’ lads</l>
     <l n="4">‘ That sew the single-soled shoon . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ It is evident , that these words cannot be so ancient as to come near the time when the battle was fought ; as Lord Home was not created an earl till near a century after that period .</p>
   <p>“ Our clergyman , in the “ Statistical Account , ” Vol . II . p. 48 , note , says , that these words were composed upon a match at foot-ball , between the Philiphaugh and Home families . I was five years at school at Selkirk , have lived all my days within two miles of that town , and never once heard a tradition of this imaginary contest till I saw it in print .</p>
   <p>“ Although the words are not very ancient , there is every reason to believe , that they allude to the battle of Flodden , and to the different behaviour of the souters , and Lord Home , upon that occasion . At election dinners , &amp; c. when the Selkirk folks begin to get fou ’ , ( merry ) they always call for music , and for that tune in particular .<span type="note_anchor">[ 25 ]</span>At such times I never heard a souter hint at the foot-ball , but many times speak of the battle of “ Flodden . ” — Letter from Mr Plummer to Mr Herd , 13th January , 1793 .</p>
   <p>The editor has taken every opportunity , which his situation<span type="note_anchor">[ 26 ]</span>has afforded him , to obtain information on this point , and has been enabled to recover two additional verses of the song .</p>
   <p>The yellow and green , mentioned in the second verse , are the liveries of the house of Home . When the Lord Home came to attend the governor , Albany , his attendants were arrayed in Kendal-green .— GODSCROFT .</p>

   <p>NOTE</p>
   <p>ON</p>
   <p>THE SOUTERS OF SELKIRK .</p>
   <p>It is unnecessary here to enter into a formal refutation of the popular calumny , which taxed Lord Home with being the murderer of his sovereign , and the cause of the defeat at Flodden . So far from exhibiting any marks of cowardice or disaffection , the division , headed by that unfortunate nobleman , was the only part of the Scottish army which was conducted with common prudence on that fatal day . This body formed the vanguard , and entirely routed the division of Sir Edmund Howard , to which they were opposed ; but the reserve of the English cavalry rendered it impossible for Home , notwithstanding his success , to come to the aid of the king , who was irretrievably ruined by his own impetuosity of temper .— PINKERTON 'S History , Vol II . p. 105 . The escape of James from the field of battle , has been long deservedly ranked with that of King Sebastian , and similar speciosa miracula with which the vulgar have been amused in all ages . Indeed , the Scottish nation were so very unwilling to admit any advantage on the English part , that they seem actually to have set up pretensions to the victory .<span type="note_anchor">[ 29 ]</span>The same temper of mind led them eagerly to ascribe the loss of their monarch , and his army , to any cause , rather than to his own misconduct , and the superior military skill of the English . There can be no doubt , that James actually fell on the field of battle , the slaughter-place of his nobles .— Pinkerton , ibid . His dead body was interred in the monastery of Sheen , in Surrey ; and Stowe mentions , with regard to it , the following degrading circumstances .</p>
   <p>“ After the battle , the bodie of the said king , being found , was closed in lead , and conveyed from thence to London , and to the monasterie of Sheyne , in Surry , where it remained for a time , in what order I am not certaine ; but , since the dissolution of that house , in the reigne of Edward VI ., Henry Gray , Duke of Norfolke , being lodged , and keeping house there , I have been shewed the same bodie , so lapped in lead , close to the head and bodie , throwne into a waste room , amongst the old timber , lead , and other rubble . Since the which time , workmen there , for their foolish pleasure , hewed off his head ; and Lancelot Young , master glazier to Queen Elizabeth , feeling a sweet savour to come from thence , and seeing the same dried from all moisture , and yet the form remaining , with haire of the head , and beard red , brought it to London , to his house in Wood-street , where , for a time , he kept it , for its sweetness , but , in the end , caused the sexton of that church ( St Michael 's , Wood-street ) to bury it amongst other bones taken out of their charnell . ” — STOWE 'S Survey of London , p. 539 .</p>

    <head>FOOTNOTES :</head>
    <head><span type="note_anchor">[ 23 ]</span>It is probable that Mr Robertson had not seen this deed , when he wrote his statistical account of the parish of Selkirk ; for it appears , that , instead of a grant of lands , the privilege granted to the community was a right of tilling one thousand acres of those which already belonged to the burgh . Hence it follows , that , previous to the field of Flodden , the town must have been possessed of a spacious domain , to which a thousand acres in tillage might bear a due proportion . This circumstance ascertains the antiquity and power of the burgh ; for , had this large tract of land been granted during the minority of James V ., the donation , to be effectual , must have been included in the charters of confirmation .</head>
     <l n="1"><span type="note_anchor">[ 24 ]</span>The charters are preserved in the records of the burgh .</l>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 25 ]</span>A singular custom is observed at conferring the freedom of the burgh . Four or five bristles , such as are used by shoemakers , are attached to the seal of the burgess ticket .

   <p>THE FLOWERS OF THE FOREST .</p>
    <p>PART FIRST .</p>
   <p>The following well known , and beautiful stanzas , were composed many years ago , by a lady of family , in Roxburghshire . The manner of the ancient minstrels is so happily imitated , that it required the most positive evidence to convince the editor that the song was of modern date . Such evidence , however , he has been able to procure ; having been favoured , through the kind intervention of Dr Somerville ( well known to the literary world , as the historian of King William , &amp; c .) , with the following authentic copy of the Flowers of the Forest .</p>
   <p>From the same respectable authority , the editor is enabled to state , that the tune of the ballad is ancient , as well as the two following lines of the first stanza :</p>
   <p>I 've heard them lilting at the ewes milking , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The flowers of the forest are a ’ wede away .</p>
   <p>Some years after the song was composed , a lady , who is now dead , repeated to the author another imperfect line of the original ballad , which presents a simple and affecting image to the mind :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ I ride single on my saddle ,</l>
     <l n="2">“ For the flowers of the forest are a ’ wede away . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The first of these trifling fragments , joined to the remembrance of the fatal battle of Flodden ( in the calamities accompanying which , the inhabitants of Ettrick Forest suffered a distinguished share ) , and to the present solitary and desolate appearance of the country , excited , in the mind of the author , the ideas , which she has expressed in a strain of elegiac simplicity and tenderness , which has seldom been equalled .</p>

   <p>These lines have been said to contain an anachronism ; the supposed date of the lamentation being about the period of the field of Flodden . The editor can see no ground for this charge . Fairs were held in Scotland from the most remote antiquity ; and are , from their very nature , scenes of pleasure and gallantry . The preachings of the friars were , indeed , professedly , meetings for a graver purpose ; but we have the authority of the Wife of Bath ( surely most unquestionable in such a point ) , that they were frequently perverted to places of rendezvous :</p>

   <p>THE FLOWERS OF THE FOREST .</p>
    <p>PART SECOND .</p>
   <p>The following verses , adapted to the ancient air of the Flowers of the Forest , are , like the elegy which precedes them , the production of a lady . The late Mrs Cockburn , daughter of Rutherford of Fairnalie , in Selkirkshire , and relict of Mr Cockburn of Ormiston ( whose father was lord justice-clerk of Scotland ) , was the authoress . Mrs Cockburn has been dead but a few years . Even at an age , advanced beyond the usual bounds of humanity , she retained a play of imagination , and an activity of intellect , which must have been attractive and delightful in youth , but was almost preternatural at her period of life . Her active benevolence , keeping pace with her genius , rendered her equally an object of love and admiration . The editor , who knew her well , takes this opportunity of doing justice to his own feelings ; and they are in unison with those of all who knew his regretted friend .</p>
   <p>The verses , which follow , were written at an early period of life , and without peculiar relation to any event , unless it were the depopulation of Ettrick Forest .</p>

    <head>THE LAIRD OF MUIRHEAD .</head>
     <l n="1">This Ballad is a fragment from MR HERD 'S MS ., communicated</l>

     <l n="3">who stated , that he extracted it , as relating to his own</l>

   <p>Under the vigorous administration of James IV . the young Earl of Caithness incurred the penalty of outlawry and forfeiture , for revenging an ancient feud . On the evening preceding the battle of Flodden , accompanied by 300 young warriors , arrayed in green , he presented himself before the king , and submitted to his mercy . This mark of attachment was so agreeable to that warlike prince , that he granted an immunity to the Earl and all his followers . The parchment , on which this immunity was inscribed , is said to be still preserved in the archives of the earls of Caithness , and is marked with the drum-strings , having been cut out of a drum-head , as no other parchment could be found in the army . The Earl , and his gallant band , perished to a man in the battle of Flodden ; since which period , it has been reckoned unlucky in Caithness to wear green , or cross the Ord on a Monday , the day of the week on which the chieftain advanced into Sutherland .</p>
   <p>Through ages left the master-hand unblest , &amp; c .— P. 138. v. 1 .</p>
   <p>In the border counties of Scotland , it was formerly customary , when any rancorous enmity subsisted between two clans , to leave the right hand of male children unchristened , that it might deal the more deadly , or , according to the popular phrase , “ unhallowed ” blows , to their enemies . By this superstitious rite , they were devoted to bear the family feud , or enmity . The same practice subsisted in Ireland , as appears from the following passage in Campion 's History of Ireland , published in 1633 . “ In some corners of the land they used a damnable superstition , leaving the right armes of their infants , males , unchristened ( as they termed it ) , to the end it might give a more ungracious and deadly blow . ” P. 15 .</p>

     <l n="2">P. 139. v. 1 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Popular superstition in Scotland still retains so formidable an idea of the guilt of blood , that those ancient edifices , or castles , where enormous crimes have been committed , are supposed to sink gradually into the ground . With regard to the castle of Hermitage , in particular , the common people believe , that thirty feet of the walls sunk , thirty feet fell , and thirty feet remain standing .</p>
   <p>Against the sacred standard strove , &amp; c .— P. 139. v. 2 .</p>
   <p>The fatal battle of the standard was fought on Cowton Moor , near Northallerton ( A. S. Ealfertun ) , in Yorkshire , 1138 . David I. commanded the Scottish army . He was opposed by Thurston , archbishop of York , who , to animate his followers , had recourse to the impressions of religious enthusiasm . The mast of a ship was fitted into the perch of a four-wheeled carriage ; on its top was placed a little casket , containing a consecrated host . It also contained the banner of St Cuthbert , round which were displayed those of St Peter of York , St John of Beverly , and St Wilfred of Rippon . This was the English standard , and was stationed in the centre of the army . Prince Henry , son of David , at the head of the men of arms , chiefly from Cumberland and Teviotdale , charged , broke , and completely dispersed , the centre ; but unfortunately was not supported by the other divisions of the Scottish army . The expression of Aldred ( p. 345 ) , describing this encounter , is more spirited than the general tenor of monkish historians ;— “ Ipsa globi australis parte , instar cassis araneae dissipata ” — that division of the phalanx was dispersed like a cobweb .</p>

   <p>IMITATIONS</p>
   <p>OF</p>
   <p>THE ANCIENT BALLAD .</p>
   <p>CHRISTIE 'S WILL .</p>
   <p>In the reign of Charles I ., when the moss-trooping practices were not entirely discontinued , the tower of Gilnockie , in the parish of Cannoby , was occupied by William Armstrong , called , for distinction 's sake , Christie 's Will , a lineal descendant of the famous John Armstrong , of Gilnockie , executed by James V.<span type="note_anchor">[ 31 ]</span>The hereditary love of plunder had descended to this person with the family mansion ; and , upon some marauding party , he was seized , and imprisoned in the tolbooth of Jedburgh . The Earl of Traquair , lord high treasurer , happening to visit Jedburgh , and knowing Christie 's Will , enquired the cause of his confinement . Will replied , he was imprisoned for stealing two tethers ( halters ) ; but , upon being more closely interrogated , acknowledged , there were two delicate colts at the end of them . The joke , such as it was , amused the Earl , who exerted his interest , and succeeded in releasing Christie 's Will from bondage . Some time afterwards , a law-suit , of importance to Lord Traquair , was to be decided in the Court of Session ; and there was every reason to believe , that the judgment would turn upon the voice of the presiding judge , who has a casting vote , in case of an equal division among his brethren . The opinion of the president was unfavourable to Lord Traquair ; and the point was , therefore , to keep him out of the way , when the question should be tried . In this dilemma , the Earl had recourse to Christie 's Will ; who , at once , offered his service , to kidnap the president . Upon due scrutiny , he found it was the judge 's practice frequently to take the air , on horseback , on the sands of Leith , without an attendant . In one of these excursions , Christie 's Will , who had long watched his opportunity , ventured to accost the president , and engage him in conversation . His address and language were so amusing , that he decoyed the president into an unfrequented and furzy common , called the Frigate Whins , where , riding suddenly up to him , he pulled him from his horse , muffled him in a large cloak , which he had provided , and rode off , with the luckless judge trussed up behind him . Will crossed the country with great expedition , by paths , only known to persons of his description , and deposited his weary and terrified burden in an old castle , in Annandale , called the Tower of Graham .<span type="note_anchor">[ 32 ]</span>The judge 's horse being found , it was concluded he had thrown his rider into the sea ; his friends went into mourning , and a successor was appointed to his office . Meanwhile , the poor president spent a heavy time in the vault of the castle . He was imprisoned , and solitary ; receiving his food through an aperture in the wall , and never hearing the sound of a human voice , save when a shepherd called his dog , by the name of Batty , and when a female domestic called upon Maudge , the cat . These , he concluded , were invocations of spirits ; for he held himself to be in the dungeon of a sorcerer . At length , after three months had elapsed , the law-suit was decided in favour of Lord Traquair ; and Will was directed to set the president at liberty . Accordingly , he entered the vault , at dead of night , seized the president , muffled him once more in the cloak , without speaking a single word , and , using the same mode of transportation , conveyed him to Leith sands , and set down the astonished judge on the very spot where he had taken him up . The joy of his friends , and the less agreeable surprise of his successor , may be easily conceived , when he appeared in court , to reclaim his office and honours . All embraced his own persuasion , that he had been spirited away by witchcraft ; nor could he himself be convinced of the contrary , until , many years afterwards , happening to travel in Annandale , his ears were saluted , once more , with the sounds of Maudge and Batty — the only notes which had solaced his long confinement . This led to a discovery of the whole story ; but , in these disorderly times , it was only laughed at , as a fair ruse de guerre .</p>
   <p>Wild and strange as this tradition may seem , there is little doubt of its foundation in fact . The judge , upon whose person this extraordinary stratagem was practised , was Sir Alexander Gibson , Lord Durie , collector of the reports , well known in the Scottish law , under the title of Durie 's Decisions . He was advanced to the station of an ordinary lord of session , 10th July , 1621 , and died , at his own house of Durie , July 1646 . Betwixt these periods his whimsical adventure must have happened ; a date which corresponds with that of the tradition .</p>
   <p>“ We may frame , ” says Forbes , “ a rational conjecture of his great learning and parts , not only from his collection of the decisions of the session , from July 1621 till July 1642 , but also from the following circumstances : 1 . In a tract of more as twenty years , he was frequently chosen vice-president , and no other lord in that time . 2 . ‘ Tis commonly reported , that some party , in a considerable action before the session , finding , that the Lord Durie could not be persuaded to think his plea good , fell upon a stratagem to prevent the influence and weight , which his lordship might have to his prejudice , by causing some strong masked men kidnap him , in the links of Leith , at his diversion on a Saturday afternoon , and transport him to some blind and obscure room in the country , where he was detained captive , without the benefit of day-light , a matter of three months ( though otherways civilly and well entertained ) ; during which time his lady and children went in mourning for him , as dead . But , after the cause aforesaid was decided , the Lord Durie was carried back by incognitos , and dropt in the same place where he had been taken up . ” — FORBES 'S Journal of the Session , Edin . 1714 . Preface , p. 28 .</p>
   <p>Tradition ascribes to Christie 's Will another memorable feat , which seems worthy of being recorded . It is well known , that , during the troubles of Charles I ., the Earl of Traquair continued unalterably fixed in his attachment to his unfortunate master , in whose service he hazarded his person , and impoverished his estate . It was of consequence , it is said , to the king 's service , that a certain packet , containing papers of importance , should be transmitted to him from Scotland . But the task was a difficult one , as the parliamentary leaders used their utmost endeavours to prevent any communication betwixt the king and his Scottish friends . Traquair , in this strait , again had recourse to the services of Christie 's Will ; who undertook the commission , conveyed the papers safely to his majesty , and received an answer , to be delivered to Lord Traquair . But , in the mean time , his embassy had taken air , and Cromwell had dispatched orders to intercept him at Carlisle . Christie 's Will , unconscious of his danger , halted in the town to refresh his horse , and then pursued his journey . But , as soon as he began to pass the long , high , and narrow bridge , which crosses the Eden at Carlisle , either end of the pass was occupied by a party of parliamentary soldiers , who were lying in wait for him . The borderer disdained to resign his enterprise , even in these desperate circumstances ; and at once forming his resolution , spurred his horse over the parapet . The river was in high flood . Will sunk — the soldiers shouted — he emerged again , and , guiding his horse to a steep bank , called the Stanners , or Stanhouse , endeavoured to land , but ineffectually , owing to his heavy horseman 's cloak , now drenched in water . Will cut the loop , and the horse , feeling himself disembarrassed , made a desperate exertion , and succeeded in gaining the bank . Our hero set off , at full speed , pursued by the troopers , who had for a time stood motionless , in astonishment at his temerity . Will , however , was well mounted ; and , having got the start , he kept it , menacing , with his pistols , any pursuer , who seemed likely to gain on him — an artifice which succeeded , although the arms were wet and useless . He was chaced to the river Eske , which he swam without hesitation ; and , finding himself on Scottish ground , and in the neighbourhood of friends , he turned on the northern bank , and , in the true spirit of a border rider , invited his followers to come through , and drink with him . After this taunt , he proceeded on his journey , and faithfully accomplished his mission . Such were the exploits of the very last border freebooter of any note .</p>
   <p>The reader is not to regard the ballad as of genuine and unmixed antiquity , though some stanzas are current upon the border , in a corrupted state . They have been eked and joined together , in the rude and ludicrous manner of the original ; but as it is to be considered as a modern ballad , it is transferred to this department of the work .</p>

     <l n="1">He thought the warlocks o ’ the rosy cross .— P . 158. v. 4 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ As for the rencounter betwixt Mr Williamson , schoolmaster at Cowper ( who has wrote a grammar ) , and the Rosicrucians , I never trusted it , till I heard it from his own son , who is present minister of Kirkaldy . He tells , that a stranger came to Cowper , and called for him : after they had drank a little , and the reckoning came to be paid , he whistled for spirits ; one , in the shape of a boy , came , and gave him gold in abundance ; no servant was seen riding with him to the town , nor enter with him into the inn . He caused his spirits , against next day , bring him noble Greek wine , from the Pope 's cellar , and tell the freshest news then at Rome ; then trysted Mr Williamson at London , who met the same man , in a coach , near to London bridge , and who called on him by his name ; he marvelled to see any know him there ; at last he found it was his Rosicrucian . He pointed to a tavern , and desired Mr Williamson to do him the favour to dine with him at that house ; whither he came at twelve o'clock , and found him , and many others of good fashion there , and a most splendid and magnificent table , furnished with all the varieties of delicate meats , where they are all served by spirits . At dinner , they debated upon the excellency of being attended by spirits ; and , after dinner , they proposed to him to assume him into their society , and make him participant of their happy life ; but , among the other conditions and qualifications requisite , this was one , that they demanded his abstracting his spirit from all materiality , and renouncing his baptismal engagements . Being amazed at this proposal , he falls a praying ; whereat they all disappear , and leave him alone . Then he began to forethink what would become of him , if he were left to pay that vast reckoning ; not having as much on him as would defray it . He calls the boy , and asks , what was become of these gentlemen , and what was to pay ? He answered , there was nothing to pay , for they had done it , and were gone about their affairs in the city . ” — FOUNTAINHALL 's Decisions , Vol . I. p. 15 . With great deference to the learned reporter , this story has all the appearance of a joke upon the poor schoolmaster , calculated at once to operate upon his credulity , and upon his fears of being left in pawn for the reckoning .</p>
   <p>Or that the gypsies ’ glamour 'd gang , &amp; c .— P. 158. v. 4 .</p>
   <p>Besides the prophetic powers , ascribed to the gypsies in most European countries , the Scottish peasants believe them possessed of the power of throwing upon by-standers a spell , to fascinate their eyes , and cause them to see the thing that is not . Thus , in the old ballad of Johnie Faa , the elopement of the countess of Cassillis , with a gypsey leader , is imputed to fascination :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">As sune as they saw her weel-far 'd face ,</l>
     <l n="2">They cast the glamour ower her .</l>

   <p>Saxo Grammaticus mentions a particular sect of Mathematicians , as he is pleased to call them , who “ per summam ludificandorum oculorum peritiam , proprios alienosque vultus , variis rerum imaginibus , adumbrare callebant ; illicibusque formis veros obscurare conspectus . ” Merlin , the son of Ambrose , was particularly skilled in this art , and displays it often in the old metrical romance of Arthour and Merlin :</p>

   <p>Our modern professors of the magic natural would likewise have been sorely put down by the Jogulours and Enchantours of the Grete Chan ; “ for they maken to come in the air the sone and the mone , beseminge to every mannes sight ; and aftre , they maken the nyght so dirke , that no man may se no thing ; and aftre , they maken the day to come agen , fair and plesant , with bright sone to every mannes sight ; and than , they bringin in daunces of the fairest damyselles of the world , and richest arrayed ; and after , they maken to comen in other damyselles , bringing coupes of gold , fulle of mylke of diverse bestes ; and geven drinke to lordes and to ladyes ; and than they maken knyghtes to justen in arms fulle lustyly ; and they rennen togidre a gret randoun , and they frusschen togidere full fiercely , and they broken her speres so rudely , that the trenchouns flen in sprotis and pieces alle aboute the halle ; and than they make to come in hunting for the hert and for the boor , with houndes renning with open mouthe : and many other things they dow of her enchauntements , that it is marveyle for to se . ” — Sir JOHN MANDEVILLE 's Travels , p. 285 . I question much , also , if the most artful illuminatus of Germany could have matched the prodigies exhibited by Pacolet and Adramain . “ Adonc Adramain leva une cappe par dessus une pillier , et en telle sort , qu'il sembla a ceux qui furent presens , que parmi la place couroit , une riviere fort grande et terrible . Et en icelle riviere sembloit avoir poissons en grand abondance , grands et petits . Et quand ceux de palais virent l'eau si grande , ils commencerent tous a lever leur robes et a crier fort , comme sils eussent eu peur d'estre noye ; et Pacolet , qui l'enchantement regarda , commenca a chanter , et fit un sort si subtil en son chant qui sembla a tous ceux de lieu que parmy la riviere couroit un cerf grand et cornu , qui jettoit et abbatoit a terre tout ce que devant lui trouvoit , puis leur fut advis que voyoyent chasseurs et veneurs courir apris le Cerf , avec grande puissance de levriers et des chiens . Lors y eut plusieurs de la compagnie qui saillirent au devant pour le Cerf attraper et cuyder prendre ; mais Pacolet fist tost le Cerf sailler . “ Bien avez joue , ” dit Orson , “ et bien scavez vostre art user . ” — L'Histoire des Valentin et Orson , a Rouen , 1631 . The receipt , to prevent the operation of these deceptions , was , to use a sprig of four-leaved clover . I remember to have heard ( certainly very long ago , for , at the time , I believed the legend ) , that a gypsey exercised his glamour over a number of people at Haddington , to whom he exhibited a common dung-hill cock , trailing , what appeared to the spectators , a massy oaken trunk . An old man passed with a cart of clover ; he stopped , and picked out a four-leaved blade ; the eyes of the spectators were opened , and the oaken trunk appeared to be a bulrush .</p>
   <p>I have tar-barrell 'd mony a witch .— P . 159. v. 1 .</p>
   <p>Human nature shrinks from the brutal scenes , produced by the belief in witchcraft . Under the idea , that the devil imprinted upon the body of his miserable vassals a mark , which was insensible to pain , persons were employed to run needles into the bodies of the old women who were suspected of witchcraft . In the dawning of common sense upon this subject , a complaint was made before the Privy Council of Scotland , 11th September , 1678 , by Catherine Liddell , a poor woman , against the baron-bailie of Preston-Grange , and David Cowan ( a professed pricker ) , for having imprisoned , and most cruelly tortured her . They answered , 1st , She was searched by her own consent , et volenti non fit injuria ; 2d , The pricker had learned his trade from Kincaid , a famed pricker ; 3d , He never acted , but when called upon by magistrates or clergymen , so what he did was auctore praetore ; 4th , His trade was lawful ; 5th , Perkins , Delrio , and all divines and lawyers , who treat of witchcraft , assert the existence of the marks , or stigmata sagarum ; and , 6thly , Were it otherwise , Error communis facit jus .— Answered , 1st , Denies consent ; 2d , Nobody can validly consent to their own torture ; for , Nemo est dominus membrorum suorum ; 3d , The pricker was a common cheat . The last arguments prevailed ; and it was found , that inferior judges “ might not use any torture , by pricking , or by with-holding them from sleep ; ” the council reserving all that to themselves , the justices , and those acting by commission from them . But Lord Durie , a lord of session , could have no share in these inflictions .</p>

   <p>THOMAS THE RHYMER .</p>
   <p>IN THREE PARTS .</p>
    <p>PART FIRST .— ANCIENT .</p>
   <p>Few personages are so renowned in tradition as Thomas of Erceldoune , known by the appellation of The Rhymer . Uniting , or supposed to unite , in his person , the powers of poetical composition , and of vaticination , his memory , even after the lapse of five hundred years , is regarded with veneration by his countrymen . To give any thing like a certain history of this remarkable man , would be indeed difficult ; but the curious may derive some satisfaction from the particulars here brought together .</p>
   <p>It is agreed , on all hands , that the residence , and probably the birth-place , of this ancient bard , was Erceldoune , a village situated upon the Leader , two miles above its junction with the Tweed . The ruins of an ancient tower are still pointed out as the Rhymer 's castle . The uniform tradition bears , that his sirname was Lermont , or Learmont ; and that the appellation of The Rhymer was conferred on him in consequence of his poetical compositions . There remains , nevertheless , some doubt upon this subject . In a charter , which is subjoined at length ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 38 ]</span>the son of our poet designs himself “ Thomas of Ercildoun , son and heir of Thomas Rymour of Ercildoun , ” which seems to imply , that the father did not bear the hereditary name of Learmont ; or , at least , was better known and distinguished by the epithet , which he had acquired by his personal accomplishments . I must , however , remark , that , down to a very late period , the practice of distinguishing the parties , even in formal writings , by the epithets which had been bestowed on them from personal circumstances , instead of the proper sirnames of their families , was common , and indeed necessary , among the border clans . So early as the end of the thirteenth century , when sirnames were hardly introduced in Scotland , this custom must have been universal . There is , therefore , nothing inconsistent in supposing our poet 's name to have been actually Learmont , although , in this charter , he is distinguished by the popular appellation of The Rhymer .</p>
   <p>We are better able to ascertain the period at which Thomas of Ercildoune lived , being the latter end of the thirteenth century . I am inclined to place his death a little farther back than Mr Pinkerton , who supposes that he was alive in 1300 ( List of Scottish Poets ) ; which is hardly , I think , consistent with the charter already quoted , by which his son , in 1299 , for himself and his heirs , conveys to the convent of the Trinity of Soltre , the tenement which he possessed by inheritance ( hereditarie ) in Ercildoun , with all claim which he , or his predecessors , could pretend thereto . From this we may infer , that the Rhymer was now dead ; since we find his son disposing of the family property . Still , however , the argument of the learned historian will remain unimpeached , as to the time of the poet 's birth . For if , as we learn from Barbour , his prophecies were held in reputation<span type="note_anchor">[ 39 ]</span>as early as 1306 , when Bruce slew the Red Cummin , the sanctity , and ( let me add to Mr Pinkerton 's words ) the uncertainty of antiquity , must have already involved his character and writings . In a charter of Peter de Haga de Bemersyde , which unfortunately wants a date , the Rhymer , a near neighbour , and , if we may trust tradition , a friend of the family , appears as a witness .— Cartulary of Melrose .</p>
   <p>It cannot be doubted , that Thomas of Ercildoun was a remarkable and important person in his own time , since , very shortly after his death , we find him celebrated as a prophet , and as a poet . Whether he himself made any pretensions to the first of these characters , or whether it was gratuitously conferred upon him by the credulity of posterity , it seems difficult to decide . If we may believe Mackenzie , Learmont only versified the prophecies delivered by Eliza , an inspired nun , of a convent at Haddington . But of this there seems not to be the most distant proof . On the contrary , all ancient authors , who quote the Rhymer 's prophecies , uniformly suppose them to have been emitted by himself . Thus , in Wintown 's Chronicle ,</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Of this fycht quilum spak Thomas</l>
     <l n="2">Of Ersyldoune , that sayd in Derne ,</l>
     <l n="3">Thare suld meit stalwartly , starke and sterne .</l>
     <l n="4">He sayd it in his prophecy ;</l>
     <l n="5">But how he wist it was ferly .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">Book VIII . chap . 32 .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>There could have been no ferly ( marvel ) in Wintown 's eyes , at least , how Thomas came by his knowledge of future events , had he ever heard of the inspired nun of Haddington ; which , it cannot be doubted , would have been a solution of the mystery , much to the taste of the prior of Lochleven .<span type="note_anchor">[ 40 ]</span></p>
   <p>Whatever doubts , however , the learned might have , as to the source of the Rhymer 's prophetic skill , the vulgar had no hesitation to ascribe the whole to the intercourse between the bard and the queen of Faery . The popular tale bears , that Thomas was carried off , at an early age , to the Fairy Land , where he acquired all the knowledge , which made him afterwards so famous . After seven years residence , he was permitted to return to the earth , to enlighten and astonish his countrymen by his prophetic powers ; still , however , remaining bound to return to his royal mistress , when she should intimate her pleasure .<span type="note_anchor">[ 41 ]</span>Accordingly , while Thomas was making merry with his friends , in the tower of Ercildoun , a person came running in , and told , with marks of fear and astonishment , that a hart and hind had left the neighbouring forest , and were , composedly and slowly , parading the street of the village .<span type="note_anchor">[ 42 ]</span>The prophet instantly arose , left his habitation , and followed the wonderful animals to the forest , whence he was never seen to return . According to the popular belief , he still “ drees his weird ” in Fairy Land , and is one day expected to revisit earth . In the meanwhile , his memory is held in the most profound respect . The Eildon Tree , from beneath the shade of which he delivered his prophecies , now no longer exists ; but the spot is marked by a large stone , called Eildon Tree Stone . A neighbouring rivulet takes the name of the Bogle Burn ( Goblin Brook ) from the Rhymer 's supernatural visitants . The veneration paid to his dwelling place , even attached itself in some degree to a person , who , within the memory of man , chose to set up his residence in the ruins of Learmont 's tower . The name of this man was Murray , a kind of herbalist ; who , by dint of some knowledge in simples , the possession of a musical clock , an electrical machine , and a stuffed aligator , added to a supposed communication with Thomas the Rhymer , lived for many years in very good credit as a wizard .</p>
   <p>It seemed to the editor unpardonable to dismiss a person , so important in border tradition as the Rhymer , without some farther notice than a simple commentary upon the following ballad . It is given from a copy , obtained from a lady , residing not far from Ercildoun , corrected and enlarged by one in Mrs Brown 's MSS . The former copy , however , as might be expected , is far more minute as to local description . To this old tale the editor has ventured to add a Second Part , consisting of a kind of Cento , from the printed prophecies vulgarly ascribed to the Rhymer ; and a Third Part , entirely modern , founded upon the tradition of his having returned with the hart and hind , to the land of Faerie . To make his peace with the more severe antiquaries , the editor has prefixed to the second part some remarks on Learmont 's prophecies .</p>

   <p>The traditional commentary upon this ballad informs us , that the apple was the produce of the fatal Tree of Knowledge , and that the garden was the terrestrial paradise . The repugnance of Thomas to be debarred the use of falsehood , when he might find it convenient , has a comic effect .</p>
   <p>The reader is here presented , from an old , and unfortunately an imperfect MS ., with the undoubted original of Thomas the Rhymer 's intrigue with the queen of Faery . It will afford great amusement to those who would study the nature of traditional poetry , and the changes effected by oral tradition , to compare this ancient romance with the foregoing ballad . The same incidents are narrated , even the expression is often the same ; yet the poems are as different in appearance , as if the older tale had been regularly and systematically modernized by a poet of the present day .</p>

   <note>The elfin queen , after restoring Thomas to earth , pours forth a string of prophecies , in which we distinguish references to the events and personages of the Scottish wars of Edward III . The battles of Duplin and Halidon are mentioned , and also Black Agnes , Countess of Dunbar . There is a copy of this poem in the museum in the cathedral of Lincoln , another in the collection in Peterborough , but unfortunately they are all in an imperfect state . Mr Jamieson , in his curious Collection of Scottish Ballads and Songs , has an entire copy of this ancient poem , with all the collations , which is now in the press , and will be soon given to the public .

    <head>THOMAS THE RHYMER .</head>
     <head>PART SECOND .</head>
    <head>ALTERED FROM ANCIENT PROPHECIES .</head>
    <head>The prophecies , ascribed to Thomas of Ercildoune , have been the principal means of securing to him remembrance “ amongst the sons of his people . ” The author of Sir Tristrem would long ago have joined , in the vale of oblivion , Clerk of Tranent , who wrote the adventure of “ Schir Gawain , ” if , by good hap , the same current of ideas respecting antiquity , which causes Virgil to be regarded as a magician by the Lazaroni of Naples , had not exalted the bard of Ercildoune to the prophetic character . Perhaps , indeed , he himself affected it during his life . We know at least , for certain , that a belief in his supernatural knowledge was current soon after his death . His prophecies are alluded to by Barbour , by Wintoun , and by Henry the Minstrel , or Blind Harry , as he is usually termed . None of these authors , however , give the words of any of the Rhymer 's vaticinations , but merely narrate , historically , his having predicted the events of which they speak . The earliest of the prophecies ascribed to him , which is now extant , is quoted by Mr Pinkerton from a MS . It is supposed to be a response from Thomas of Ercildoune , to a question from the heroic Countess of March , renowned for the defence of the castle of Dunbar against the English , and termed , in the familiar dialect of her time , Black Agnes of Dunbar . This prophecy is remarkable , in so far as it bears very little resemblance to any verses published in the printed copy of the Rhymer 's supposed prophecies . The verses are as follows :</head>

   <p>As I have never seen the MS. from which Mr Pinkerton makes this extract , and as the date of it is fixed by him ( certainly one of the most able antiquaries of our age ) , to the reign of Edward I. or II ., it is with great diffidence that I hazard a contrary opinion . There can , however , I believe , be little doubt , that these prophetic verses are a forgery , and not the production of our Thomas the Rhymer . But I am inclined to believe them of a later date than the reign of Edward I. or II .</p>
   <p>The gallant defence of the castle of Dunbar , by Black Agnes , took place in the year 1337 . The Rhymer died previous to the year 1299 ( see the charter , by his son , in the introduction to the foregoing ballad ) . It seems , therefore , very improbable , that the Countess of Dunbar could ever have an opportunity of consulting Thomas the Rhymer , since that would infer that she was married , or at least engaged in state matters , previous to 1299 ; whereas she is described as a young , or a middle-aged , woman , at the period of her being besieged in the fortress , which she so well defended . If the editor might indulge a conjecture , he would suppose , that the prophecy was contrived for the encouragement of the English invaders , during the Scottish wars ; and that the names of the Countess of Dunbar , and of Thomas of Ercildoune , were used for the greater credit of the forgery . According to this hypothesis , it seems likely to have been composed after the siege of Dunbar , which had made the name of the Countess well known , and consequently in the reign of Edward III . The whole tendency of the prophecy is to aver , “ that there shall be no end of the Scottish war ( concerning which the question was proposed ) , till a final conquest of the country by England , attended by all the usual severities of war . When the cultivated country shall become forest — says the prophecy ;— when the wild animals shall inhabit the abode of men ;— when Scots shall not be able to escape the English , should they crouch as hares in their form — all these denunciations seem to refer to the time of Edward III ., upon whose victories the prediction was probably founded . ” The mention of the exchange betwixt a colt worth ten markes , and a quarter of “ whaty ( indifferent ) wheat , ” seems to allude to the dreadful famine , about the year 1388 . The independence of Scotland was , however , as impregnable to the mines of superstition , as to the steel of our more powerful and more wealthy neighbours . The war of Scotland is , thank God , at an end ; but it is ended without her people having either crouched , like hares , in their form , or being drowned in their flight “ for faute of ships , ” — thank God for that too . The prophecy , quoted in p. 179 ., is probably of the same date , and intended for the same purpose . A minute search of the records of the time would , probably , throw additional light upon the allusions contained in these ancient legends . Among various rhymes of prophetic import , which are at this day current amongst the people of Teviotdale , is one , supposed to be pronounced by Thomas the Rhymer , presaging the destruction of his habitation and family :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The hare sall kittle ( litter ) on my hearth stane ,</l>
     <l n="2">And there will never be a laird Learmont again .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The first of these lines is obviously borrowed from that in the MS , of the Harl . Library .— “ When hares kendles o ’ the her'stane ” — an emphatic image of desolation . It is also inaccurately quoted in the prophecy of Waldhave , published by Andro Hart , 1613 :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ This is a true talking that Thomas of tells ,</l>
     <l n="2">The hare shall hirple on the hard ( hearth ) stane . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Spottiswoode , an honest , but credulous historian , seems to have been a firm believer in the authenticity of the prophetic wares , vended in the name of Thomas of Ercildoun . “ The prophecies , yet extant in Scottish rhymes , whereupon he was commonly called Thomas the Rhymer , may justly be admired ; having foretold , so many ages before , the union of England and Scotland in the ninth degree of the Bruce 's blood , with the succession of Bruce himself to the crown , being yet a child , and other divers particulars , which the event hath ratified and made good . Boethius , in his story , relateth his prediction of King Alexander 's death , and that he did foretell the same to the Earl of March , the day before it fell out ; saying , ‘ That before the next day at noon , such a tempest should blow , as Scotland had not felt for many years before . ’ The next morning , the day being clear , and no change appearing in the air , the nobleman did challenge Thomas of his saying , calling him an impostor . He replied , that noon was not yet passed . About which time , a post came to advertise the earl , of the king his sudden death . ‘ Then , ’ said Thomas , ‘ this is the tempest I foretold ; and so it shall prove to Scotland . ’ Whence , or how , he had this knowledge , can hardly be affirmed ; but sure it is , that he did divine and answer truly of many things to come . ” — Spottiswoode , p. 47 . Besides that notable voucher , master Hector Boece , the good archbishop might , had he been so minded , have referred to Fordun for the prophecy of King Alexander 's death . That historian calls our bard “ ruralis ille vates . ” — Fordun , lib . x. cap . 40 .</p>
   <p>What Spottiswoode calls “ the prophecies extant in “ Scottish rhyme , ” are the metrical predictions ascribed to the prophet of Ercildoun , which , with many other compositions of the same nature , bearing the names of Bede , Merlin , Gildas , and other approved soothsayers , are contained in one small volume , published by Andro Hart , at Edinburgh , 1615 . The late excellent Lord Hailes made these compositions the subject of a dissertation , published in his Remarks on the History of Scotland . His attention is chiefly directed to the celebrated prophecy of our bard , mentioned by Bishop Spottiswoode , bearing , that the crowns of England and Scotland should be united in the person of a king , son of a French queen , and related to Bruce in the ninth degree . Lord Hailes plainly proves , that this prophecy is perverted from its original purpose , in order to apply it to the succession of James VI . The ground-work of the forgery is to be found in the prophecies of Berlington , contained in the same collection , and runs thus :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Of Bruce 's left side shall spring out as a leafe ,</l>
     <l n="2">As neere as the ninth degree ;</l>
     <l n="3">And shall be fleemed of faire Scotland ,</l>
     <l n="4">In France farre beyond the sea .</l>
     <l n="5">And then shall come againe ryding ,</l>
     <l n="6">With eyes that many men may see .</l>
     <l n="7">At Aberladie he shall light ,</l>
     <l n="8">With hempen helteres and horse of tre .</l>
     <l n="9">. . . . . . . .</l>
     <l n="10">However it happen for to fall ,</l>
     <l n="11">The lyon shall be lord of all ;</l>
     <l n="12">The French quen shal bearre the sonne ,</l>
     <l n="13">Shal rule all Britainne to the sea ;</l>
     <l n="14">Ane from the Bruce 's blood shal come also ,</l>
     <l n="15">As neere as the ninth degree .</l>
     <l n="16">. . . . . . . .</l>
     <l n="17">Yet shal there come a keene knight over the salt sea ,</l>
     <l n="18">A keene man of courage and bold man of armes ;</l>
     <l n="19">A duke 's son dowbled ( i. e . dubbed ) , a borne mon in France ,</l>
     <l n="20">That shall our mirths augment , and mend all our harmes ;</l>
     <l n="21">After the date of our Lord 1513 , and thrice three thereafter ;</l>
     <l n="22">Which shall brooke all the broad isle to himself ,</l>
     <l n="23">Between 13 and thrice three the threip shal be ended ,</l>
     <l n="24">The Saxons sall never recover after .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>There cannot be any doubt , that this prophecy was intended to excite the confidence of the Scottish nation in the Duke of Albany , regent of Scotland , who arrived from France in 1515 , two years after the death of James IV . in the fatal field of Flodden . The regent was descended of Bruce by the left , i. e . by the female side , within the ninth degree . His mother was daughter of the Earl of Boulogne , his father banished from his country — “ fleemit of fair Scotland . ” His arrival must necessarily be by sea , and his landing was expected at Aberlady , in the Frith of Forth . He was a duke 's son , dubbed knight ; and nine years , from 1513 , are allowed him , by the pretended prophet , for the accomplishment of the salvation of his country , and the exaltation of Scotland over her sister and rival . All this was a pious fraud , to excite the confidence and spirit of the country .</p>
   <p>The prophecy , put in the name of our Thomas the Rhymer , as it stands in Hart 's book , refers to a later period . The narrator meets the Rhymer upon a land beside a lee , who shows him many emblematical visions , described in no mean strain of poetry . They chiefly relate to the fields of Flodden and Pinkie , to the national distress which followed these defeats , and to future halcyon days , which are promised to Scotland . One quotation or two will be sufficient to establish this fully :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Our Scottish king sal come ful keene ,</l>
     <l n="2">The red lyon beareth he ;</l>
     <l n="3">A feddered arrow sharp , I weene ,</l>
     <l n="4">Shall make him winke and warre to see .</l>
     <l n="5">Out of the field he shall be led ,</l>
     <l n="6">When he is bludie and woe for blood ;</l>
     <l n="7">Yet to his men shall he say ,</l>
     <l n="8">“ For God 's luve , turn you againe ,</l>
     <l n="9">“ And give yon sutherne folk a frey !</l>
     <l n="10">“ Why should I lose the right is mine ?</l>
     <l n="11">“ My date is not to die this day . ” —</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Who can doubt , for a moment , that this refers to the battle of Flodden , and to the popular reports concerning the doubtful fate of James IV .? Allusion is immediately afterwards made to the death of George Douglas , heir apparent of Angus , who fought and fell with his sovereign :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The sternes three that day shall die ,</l>
     <l n="2">That bears the harte in silver sheen .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The well-known arms of the Douglas family are the heart and three stars . In another place , the battle of Pinkie is expressly mentioned by name :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">At Pinken Cluch there shall be spilt ,</l>
     <l n="2">Much gentle blood that day ;</l>
     <l n="3">There shall the bear lose the guilt ,</l>
     <l n="4">And the eagill bear it away .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>To the end of all this allegorical and mystical rhapsody , is interpolated , in the later edition by Andro Hart , a new edition of Berlington 's verses , before quoted , altered and manufactured so as to bear reference to the accession of James VI ., which had just then taken place . The insertion is made with a peculiar degree of awkwardness , betwixt a question , put by the narrator , concerning the name and abode of the person who shewed him these strange matters , and the answer of the prophet to that question :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Then to the Bairne could I say ,</l>
     <l n="2">“ Where dwells thou , or in what countrie ?</l>
     <l n="3">“ [ Or who shall rule the isle of Britane ,</l>
     <l n="4">“ From the north to the south sey ?</l>
     <l n="5">“ A French queene shall beare the sonne ,</l>
     <l n="6">“ Shall rule all Britaine to the sea ;</l>
     <l n="7">“ Which of the Bruce 's blood shall come ,</l>
     <l n="8">“ As neere as the nint degree :</l>
     <l n="9">“ I frained fast what was his name ,</l>
     <l n="10">“ Where that he came , from what country . ]</l>
     <l n="11">“ In Erslingtoun I dwell at hame ,</l>
     <l n="12">“ Thomas Rymour men cals me . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>There is surely no one , who will not conclude , with Lord Hailes , that the eight lines , inclosed in brackets , are a clumsy interpolation , borrowed from Berlington , with such alterations as might render the supposed prophecy applicable to the union of the crowns .</p>
   <p>While we are on this subject , it may be proper briefly to notice the scope of some of the other predictions , in Hart 's Collection . As the prophecy of Berlington was intended to raise the spirits of the nation , during the regency of Albany , so those of Sybilla and Eltraine refer to that of the Earl of Arran , afterwards Duke of Chatelherault , during the minority of Mary , a period of similar calamity . This is obvious from the following verses :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Take a thousand in calculation ,</l>
     <l n="2">And the longest of the lyon ,</l>
     <l n="3">Four crescents under one crowne ,</l>
     <l n="4">With Saint Andrew 's croce thrise ,</l>
     <l n="5">Then threescore and thrise three :</l>
     <l n="6">Take tent to Merling truely ,</l>
     <l n="7">Then shall the warres ended be ,</l>
     <l n="8">And never againe rise .</l>
     <l n="9">In that yere there shall a king ,</l>
     <l n="10">A duke , and no crowned king ;</l>
     <l n="11">Becaus the prince shall be yong ,</l>
     <l n="12">And tender of yeares .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The date , above hinted at , seems to be 1549 , when the Scottish regent , by means of some succours derived from France , was endeavouring to repair the consequences of the fatal battle of Pinkie . Allusion is made to the supply given to the “ Moldwarte ” ( England ) by the fained “ hart ” ( the Earl of Angus ) . The regent is described by his bearing the antelope ; large supplies are promised from France , and complete conquest predicted to Scotland and her allies . Thus was the same hackneyed stratagem repeated , whenever the interest of the rulers appeared to stand in need of it . The regent was not , indeed , till after this period , created Duke of Chatelherault ; but that honour was the object of his hopes and expectations .</p>
   <p>The name of our renowned soothsayer is liberally used as an authority , throughout all the prophecies published by Andro Hart . Besides those expressly put in his name , Gildas , another assumed personage , is supposed to derive his knowledge from him ; for he concludes thus :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ True Thomas me told in a troublesome time ,</l>
     <l n="2">“ In a harvest morn at Eldoun hills . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">The Prophecy of Gildas .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">In the prophecy of Berlington , already quoted , we are told ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="5">“ Marvellous Merlin , that many men of tells ,</l>
     <l n="6">“ And Thomas 's sayings comes all at once . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>While I am upon the subject of these prophecies , may I be permitted to call the attention of antiquaries to Merdwynn Wyllt , or Merlin the Wild , in whose name , and by no means in that of Ambrose Merlin , the friend of Arthur , the Scottish prophecies are issued . That this personage resided at Drummelziar , and roamed , like a second Nebuchadnezzar , the woods of Tweeddale , in remorse for the death of his nephew , we learn from Fordun . In the Scotichronicon , lib . 3 , cap . 31 , is an account of an interview betwixt St Kentigern and Merlin , then in this distracted and miserable state . He is said to have been called Lailoken , from his mode of life . On being commanded by the saint to give an account of himself , he says , that the penance , which he performs , was imposed on him by a voice from heaven , during a bloody contest betwixt Lidel and Carwanolow , of which battle he had been the cause . According to his own prediction , he perished at once by wood , earth , and water ; for , being pursued with stones by the rustics , he fell from a rock into the river Tweed , and was transfixed by a sharp stake , fixed there for the purpose of extending a fishing-net :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Sude perfossus , lapide percussus et unda</l>
     <l n="2">Haec tria Merlinum fertur inire necem .</l>
     <l n="3">Sicque ruit , mersusque fuit lignoque perpendi ,</l>
     <l n="4">Et fecit vatem per terna pericula verum .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But , in a metrical history of Merlin of Caledonia , compiled by Geoffrey of Monmouth , from the traditions of the Welch bards , this mode of death is attributed to a page , whom Merlin 's sister , desirous to convict the prophet of falsehood , because he had betrayed her intrigues , introduced to him , under three various disguises , enquiring each time in what manner the person should die . To the first demand Merlin answered , the party should perish by a fall from a rock ; to the second , that he should die by a tree ; and to the third , that he should be drowned . The youth perished , while hunting , in the mode imputed by Fordun to Merlin himself .</p>
   <p>Fordun , contrary to the Welch authorities , confounds this person with the Merlin of Arthur ; but concludes by informing us , that many believed him to be a different person . The grave of Merlin is pointed out at Drummelziar , in Tweeddale , beneath an aged thorn-tree . On the east side of the church-yard , the brook , called Pausayl , falls into the Tweed ; and the following prophecy is said to have been current concerning their union :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">When Tweed and Pausayl join at Merlin 's grave ,</l>
     <l n="2">Scotland and England shall one monarch have .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>On the day of the coronation of James VI . the Tweed accordingly overflowed , and joined the Pausayl at the prophet 's grave .— PENNYCUICK 's History of Tweeddale , p. 26 . These circumstances would seem to infer a communication betwixt the south-west of Scotland and Wales , of a nature peculiarly intimate ; for I presume that Merlin would retain sense enough to chuse , for the scene of his wanderings , a country , having a language and manners similar to his own .</p>
   <p>Be this as it may , the memory of Merlin Sylvester , or the Wild , was fresh among the Scots during the reign of James V. Waldhave ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 44 ]</span>under whose name a set of prophecies was published , describes himself as lying upon Lomond Law ; he hears a voice , which bids him stand to his defence ; he looks around , and beholds a flock of hares and foxes<span type="note_anchor">[ 45 ]</span>pursued over the mountain by a savage figure , to whom he can hardly give the name of man . At the sight of Waldhave , the apparition leaves the objects of his pursuit , and assaults him with a club . Waldhave defends himself with his sword , throws the savage to the earth , and refuses to let him arise till he swear , by the law and lead he lives upon , “ to do him no harm . ” This done , he permits him to arise , and marvels at his strange appearance :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ He was formed like a freike ( man ) all his four quarters ;</l>
     <l n="2">“ And then his chin and his face haired so thick ,</l>
     <l n="3">“ With haire growing so grime , fearful to see . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>He answers briefly to Waldhave 's enquiry , concerning his name and nature , that he “ drees his weird , ” i. e . does penance , in that wood ; and , having hinted that questions as to his own state are offensive , he pours forth an obscure rhapsody concerning futurity , and concludes ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Go musing upon Merlin if thou wilt ;</l>
     <l n="2">“ For I mean no more man at this time . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>This is exactly similar to the meeting betwixt Merlin and Kentigern in Fordun . These prophecies of Merlin seem to have been in request in the minority of James V .; for , among the amusements , with which Sir David Lindsay diverted that prince during his infancy , are ,</p>
   <p>The prophecies of Rymer , Bede , and Merlin .</p>
   <p>Sir David Lindsay 's Epistle to the King .</p>
   <p>And we find , in Waldhave , at least one allusion to the very ancient prophecy , addressed to the countess of Dunbar :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">This is a true token that Thomas of tells ,</l>
     <l n="2">When a ladde with a ladye shall go over the fields .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">The original stands thus :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">When laddes weddeth lovedies .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Another prophecy of Merlin seems to have been current about the time of the regent Morton 's execution .— When that nobleman was committed to the charge of his accuser , captain James Stewart , newly created Earl of Arran , to be conducted to his trial at Edinburgh , Spottiswoode says , that he asked , “ Who was earl of Arran ? ” “ and being answered that Captain James was the man , after a short pause he said , ‘ And is it so ? I know then what I may look for ! ’ meaning , as was thought , that the old prophecy of the ‘ Falling of the heart<span type="note_anchor">[ 46 ]</span>by the mouth of Arran , ’ should then be fulfilled . Whether this was his mind or not , it is not known ; but some spared not , at the time when the Hamiltons were banished , in which business he was held too earnest , to say , that he stood in fear of that prediction , and went that course only to disappoint it . But , if so it was , he did find himself now deluded ; for he fell by the mouth of another Arran than he imagined . ” — Spottiswoode , 313 . The fatal words , alluded to , seem to be these in the prophecy of Merlin :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ In the mouth of Arrane a selcouth shall fall ,</l>
     <l n="2">“ Two bloodie hearts shall be taken with a false traine ,</l>
     <l n="3">“ And derfly dung down without any dome . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>To return from these desultory remarks , into which the editor has been led by the celebrated name of Merlin , the style of all these prophecies , published by Hart , is very much the same . The measure is alliterative , and somewhat similar to that of Pierce Plowman 's Visions ; a circumstance , which might entitle us to ascribe to some of them an earlier date than the reign of James V ., did we not know that Sir Galloran of Galloway , and Gawaine and Gologras , two romances rendered almost unintelligible by the extremity of affected alliteration , are perhaps not prior to that period . Indeed , although we may allow , that , during much earlier times , prophecies , under the names of those celebrated soothsayers , have been current in Scotland , yet those published by Hart have obviously been so often vamped and re-vamped , to serve the political purposes of different periods , that it may be shrewdly suspected , that , as in the case of Sir John Cutler 's transmigrated stockings , very little of the original materials now remains . I cannot refrain from indulging my readers with the publisher 's title to the last prophecy ; as it contains certain curious information concerning the queen of Sheba , who is identified with the Cumaean Sybil : “ Here followeth a prophecie , pronounced by a noble queene and matron , called Sybilla , Regina Austri , that came to Solomon . Through the which she compiled four bookes , at the instance and request of the said king Sol . and others divers : and the fourth book was directed to a noble king , called Baldwine , king of the broad isle of Britain ; in the which she maketh mention of two noble princes and emperours , the which is called Leones . How these two shall subdue , and overcome all earthlie princes to their diademe and crowne , and also be glorified and crowned in the heaven among saints . The first of these two is Constantinus Magnus ; that was Leprosus , the son of Saint Helene , that found the croce . The second is the sixty king of the name of Steward of Scotland , the which is our most noble king . ” With such editors and commentators , what wonder that the text became unintelligible , even beyond the usual oracular obscurity of prediction ?</p>
   <p>If there still remain , therefore , among these predictions , any verses having a claim to real antiquity , it seems now impossible to discover them from those which are comparatively modern . Nevertheless , as there are to be found , in these compositions , some uncommonly wild and masculine expressions , the editor has been induced to throw a few passages together , into the sort of ballad to which this disquisition is prefixed . It would , indeed , have been no difficult matter for him , by a judicious selection , to have excited , in favour of Thomas of Erceldoune , a share of the admiration , bestowed by sundry wise persons upon Mass Robert Fleming . For example :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ But then the lilye shal be loused when they least think ;</l>
     <l n="2">Then clear king 's blood shal quake for fear of death ;</l>
     <l n="3">For churls shal chop off heads of their chief beirns ,</l>
     <l n="4">And carfe of the crowns that Christ hath appointed .</l>
     <l n="5">. . . . . . . .</l>
     <l n="6">Thereafter , on every side , sorrow shal arise ;</l>
     <l n="7">The barges of clear barons down shal be sunken ;</l>
     <l n="8">Seculars shal sit in spiritual seats ,</l>
     <l n="9">Occupying offices anointed as they were . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Taking the lilye for the emblem of France , can there be a more plain prophecy of the murder of her monarch , the destruction of her nobility , and the desolation of her hierarchy ?</p>
   <p>But , without looking farther into the signs of the times , the editor , though the least of all the prophets , cannot help thinking , that every true Briton will approve of his application of the last prophecy quoted in the ballad .</p>
   <p>Hart 's collection of prophecies was frequently reprinted during the last century , probably to favour the pretensions of the unfortunate family of Stewart . For the prophetic renown of Gildas and Bede , see Fordun , lib . 3 .</p>
   <p>Before leaving the subject of Thomas 's predictions , it may be noticed , that sundry rhymes , passing for his prophetic effusions , are still current among the vulgar . Thus , he is said to have prophecied of the very ancient family of Haig of Bemerside ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Betide , betide , whate'er betide ,</l>
     <l n="2">Haig shall be Haig of Bemerside .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The grandfather of the present proprietor of Bemerside had twelve daughters , before his lady brought him a male heir . The common people trembled for the credit of their favourite soothsayer . The late Mr Haig was at length born , and their belief in the prophecy confirmed beyond a shadow of doubt .</p>
   <p>Another memorable prophecy bore , that the Old Kirk at Kelso , constructed out of the ruins of the abbey , should fall when “ at the fullest . ” At a very crowded sermon , about thirty years ago , a piece of lime fell from the roof of the church . The alarm , for the fulfilment of the words of the seer , became universal ; and happy were they , who were nearest the door of the predestined edifice . The church was in consequence deserted , and has never since had an opportunity of tumbling upon a full congregation . I hope , for the sake of a beautiful specimen of Saxo-Gothick architecture , that the accomplishment of this prophecy is far distant .</p>
   <p>Another prediction , ascribed to the Rhymer , seems to have been founded on that sort of insight into futurity , possessed by most men of a sound and combining judgement . It runs thus :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">At Eildon Tree if you shall be ,</l>
     <l n="2">A brigg ower Tweed you there may see .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The spot in question commands an extensive prospect of the course of the river ; and it was easy to foresee , that , when the country should become in the least degree improved , a bridge would be somewhere thrown over the stream . In fact , you now see no less than three bridges from that elevated situation .</p>
   <p>Corspatrick ( Comes Patrick ) , Earl of March , but more commonly taking his title from his castle of Dunbar , acted a noted part during the wars of Edward I. in Scotland . As Thomas of Erceldoune is said to have delivered to him his famous prophecy of King Alexander 's death , the editor has chosen to introduce him into the following ballad . All the prophetic verses are selected from Hart 's publication .</p>

The poem , after narrating , that the prophet had fled to the forests in a state of distraction , proceeds to mention , that , looking upon the stars one clear evening , he discerned , from his astrological knowledge , that his wife , Guendolen , had resolved , upon the next morning , to take another husband . As he had presaged to her that this would happen , and had promised her a nuptial gift ( cautioning her , however , to keep the bridegroom out of his sight ) , he now resolved to make good his word . Accordingly , he collected all the stags and lesser game in his neighbourhood ; and , having seated himself upon a buck , drove the herd before him to the capital of Cumberland , where Guendolen resided . But her lover 's curiosity leading him to inspect too nearly this extraordinary cavalcade , Merlin 's rage was awakened , and he slew him with the stroke of an antler of the stag .

    <head>THOMAS THE RHYMER .</head>
     <head>PART THIRD — MODERN .</head>
    <head>BY THE EDITOR .</head>
    <head>Thomas the Rhymer was renowned among his contemporaries , as the author of the celebrated romance of Sir Tristrem . Of this once admired poem only one copy is now known to exist , which is in the Advocates ’ Library . The editor , in 1804 , published a small edition of this curious work ; which , if it does not revive the reputation of the bard of Ercildoune , will be at least the earliest specimen of Scottish poetry , hitherto published . Some account of this romance has already been given to the world in MR ELLIS 's Specimens of Ancient Poetry , Vol . I. p. 165 , 3d . p. 410 ; a work , to which our predecessors and our posterity are alike obliged ; the former , for the preservation of the best selected examples of their poetical taste ; and the latter , for a history of the English language , which will only cease to be interesting with the existence of our mother-tongue , and all that genius and learning have recorded in it . It is sufficient here to mention , that , so great was the reputation of the romance of Sir Tristrem , that few were thought capable of reciting it after the manner of the author — a circumstance alluded to by Robert de Brunne , the annalist :</head>
     <l n="1">I see in song , in sedgeyng tale ,</l>
     <l n="2">Of Erceldoun , and of Kendale .</l>
     <l n="3">Now thame says as they thame wroght ,</l>
     <l n="4">And in thare saying it semes nocht .</l>
     <l n="5">That thou may here in Sir Tristrem ,</l>

     <l n="7">Over all that is or was ;</l>
     <l n="8">If men it said as made Thomas , &amp; c .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It appears , from a very curious MS. of the thirteenth century , penes Mr Douce , of London , containing a French metrical romance of Sir Tristrem , that the work of our Thomas the Rhymer was known , and referred to , by the minstrels of Normandy and Bretagne . Having arrived at a part of the romance , where reciters were wont to differ in the mode of telling the story , the French bard expressly cites the authority of the poet of Erceldoune :</p>

   </lg>
   <p>The tale of Sir Tristrem , as narrated in the Edinburgh MS ., is totally different from the voluminous romance in prose , originally compiled on the same subject by Rusticien de Puise , and analysed by M. de Tressan ; but agrees in every essential particular with the metrical performance , just quoted , which is a work of much higher antiquity .</p>
   <p>The following attempt to commemorate the Rhymer 's poetical fame , and the traditional account of his marvellous return to Fairy Land , being entirely modern , would have been placed with greater propriety among the class of Modern Ballads , had it not been for its immediate connection with the first and second parts of the same story .</p>

   <p>THE EVE OF SAINT JOHN .</p>
   <p>BY THE EDITOR .</p>
   <p>Smaylho'me , or Smallholm Tower , the scene of the following ballad , is situated on the northern boundary of Roxburghshire , among a cluster of wild rocks , called Sandiknow-Crags , the property of Hugh Scott , Esq . of Harden . The tower is a high square building , surrounded by an outer wall , now ruinous . The circuit of the outer court , being defended , on three sides , by a precipice and morass , is accessible only from the west , by a steep and rocky path . The apartments , as is usual in a border-keep , or fortress , are placed one above another , and communicate by a narrow stair ; on the roof are two bartizans , or platforms , for defence or pleasure . The inner door of the tower is wood , the outer an iron gate ; the distance between them being nine feet , the thickness , namely , of the wall . From the elevated situation of Smaylho'me Tower , it is seen many miles in every direction . Among the crags , by which it is surrounded , one , more eminent , is called the Watchfold , and is said to have been the station of a beacon , in the times of war with England . Without the tower-court is a ruined chapel . Brotherstone is a heath , in the neighbourhood of Smaylho'me Tower .</p>
   <p>This ballad was first printed in Mr LEWIS 's Tales of Wonder . It is here published , with some additional illustrations , particularly an account of the battle of Ancram Moor ; which seemed proper in a work upon border antiquities . The catastrophe of the tale is founded upon a well-known Irish tradition .<span type="note_anchor">[ 54 ]</span>This ancient fortress and its vicinity formed the scene of the editor 's infancy , and seemed to claim from him this attempt to celebrate them in a Border Tale .</p>

   <p>The king of England had promised to these two barons a feudal grant of the country , which they had thus reduced to a desert ; upon hearing which , Archibald Douglas , the seventh Earl of Angus , is said to have sworn to write the deed of investiture upon their skins , with sharp pens and bloody ink , in resentment for their having defaced the tombs of his ancestors , at Melrose .— Godscroft . In 1545 , Lord Evers and Latoun again entered Scotland , with an army consisting of 3000 mercenaries , 1500 English borderers , and 700 assured Scottish-men , chiefly Armstrongs , Turnbulls , and other broken clans . In this second incursion , the English generals even exceeded their former cruelty . Evers burned the tower of Broomhouse , with its lady ( a noble and aged woman , says Lesley ) , and her whole family . The English penetrated as far as Melrose , which they had destroyed last year , and which they now again pillaged . As they returned towards Jedburgh , they were followed by Angus , at the head of 1000 horse , who was shortly after joined by the famous Norman Lesley , with a body of Fife-men . The English , being probably unwilling to cross the Teviot , while the Scots hung upon their rear , halted upon Ancram Moor , above the village of that name ; and the Scottish general was deliberating whether to advance or retire , when Sir Walter Scott ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 62 ]</span>of Buccleuch , came up at full speed , with a small , but chosen body of his retainers , the rest of whom were near at hand . By the advice of this experienced warrior ( to whose conduct Pitscottie and Buchanan ascribe the success of the engagement ) , Angus withdrew from the height which he occupied , and drew up his forces behind it , upon a piece of low flat ground , called Panier-heugh , or Peniel-heugh . The spare horses being sent to an eminence in their rear , appeared to the English to be the main body of the Scots , in the act of flight . Under this persuasion , Evers and Latoun hurried precipitately forwards , and , having ascended the hill , which their foes had abandoned , were no less dismayed than astonished , to find the phalanx of Scottish Spearmen drawn up , in firm array , upon the flat ground below . The Scots in their turn became the assailants . A heron , roused from the marshes by the tumult , soared away betwixt the encountering armies : “ O ! ” exclaimed Angus , “ that I had here my white goss-hawk , that we might all yoke at once ! ” — Godscroft . The English , breathless and fatigued , having the setting sun and wind full in their faces , were unable to withstand the resolute and desperate charge of the Scottish lances . No sooner had they begun to waver , than their own allies , the assured borderers , who had been waiting the event , threw aside their red crosses , and , joining their countrymen , made a most merciless slaughter among the English fugitives , the pursuers calling upon each other to “ remember Broomhouse ! ” — Lesley , p. 478 . In the battle fell Lord Evers , and his son , together with Sir Brian Latoun , and 800 Englishmen , many of whom were persons of rank . A thousand prisoners were taken . Among these was a patriotic alderman of London , Read by name , who , having contumaciously refused to pay his portion of a benevolence , demanded from the city by Henry VIII ., was sent by royal authority to serve against the Scots . These , at settling his ransom , he found still more exorbitant in their exactions than the monarch .— REDPATH 's Border History , p. 553 . Evers was much regretted by King Henry , who swore to avenge his death upon Angus , against whom he conceived himself to have particular grounds of resentment , on account of favours received by the Earl at his hands . The answer of Angus was worthy of a Douglas : “ Is our brother-in-law offended ,"[ 63 ] said he , “ that I , as a good Scotsman , have avenged my ravaged country , and the defaced tombs of my ancestors , upon Ralph Evers ? They were better men than he , and I was bound to do no less — and will he take my life for that ? Little knows King Henry the skirts of Kirnetable :[ 64 ] I can keep myself there against all his English host . ” — Godscroft .</p>
   <p>Such was the noted battle of Ancram Moor . The spot , on which it was fought , is called Lyliard 's Edge , from an Amazonian Scottish woman of that name , who is reported , by tradition , to have distinguished herself in the same manner as squire Witherington . The old people point out her monument , now broken and defaced . The inscription is said to have been legible within this century , and to have run thus :</p>

     <l n="1">Fair maiden Lylliard lies under this stane ,</l>
     <l n="2">Little was her stature , but great was her fame ;</l>

     <l n="4">And , when her legs were cutted off , she fought upon her stumps .</l>

   <p>It appears , from a passage in Stowe , that an ancestor of Lord Evers held also a grant of Scottish lands from an English monarch . “ I have seen , ” says the historian , “ under the broad-seale of the said King Edward I ., a manor , called Ketnes , in the countie of Ferfare , in Scotland , and neere the furthest part of the same nation northward , given to John Eure and his heiress , ancestor to the Lord Eure , that now is , for his service done in these partes , with market , &amp; c. dated at Lanercost , the 20th day of October , anno regis , 34 . ” — STOWE 's Annals , p. 210 . This grant , like that of Henry , must have been dangerous to the receiver .</p>
   <p>There is a nun in Dryburgh bower .— P . 239. v. 3 .</p>
   <p>The circumstance of the nun , “ who never saw the day , ” is not entirely imaginary . About fifty years ago , an unfortunate female-wanderer took up her residence in a dark vault , among the ruins of Dryburgh abbey , which , during the day , she never quitted . When night fell , she issued from this miserable habitation , and went to the house of Mr Halliburton of Newmains , the editor 's great-grandfather , or to that of Mr Erskine of Sheilfield , two gentlemen of the neighbourhood . From their charity , she obtained such necessaries as she could be prevailed upon to accept . At twelve , each night , she lighted her candle , and returned to her vault ; assuring her friendly neighbours , that , during her absence , her habitation was arranged by a spirit , to whom she gave the uncouth name of Fatlips ; describing him as a little man , wearing heavy iron shoes , with which he trampled the clay floor of the vault , to dispel the damps . This circumstance caused her to be regarded , by the well-informed , with compassion , as deranged in her understanding ; and by the vulgar , with some degree of terror . The cause of her adopting this extraordinary mode of life she would never explain . It was , however , believed to have been occasioned by a vow , that , during the absence of a man , to whom she was attached , she would never look upon the sun . Her lover never returned . He fell during the civil-war of 1745-6 , and she never more would behold the light of day .</p>
   <p>The vault , or rather dungeon , in which this unfortunate woman lived and died , passes still by the name of the supernatural being , with which its gloom was tenanted by her disturbed imagination , and few of the neighbouring peasants dare enter it by night .</p>

   <p>LORD SOULIS .</p>
   <p>BY J. LEYDEN .</p>
   <p>The subject of the following ballad is a popular tale of the Scottish borders . It refers to transactions of a period so important , as to have left an indelible impression on the popular mind , and almost to have effaced the traditions of earlier times . The fame of Arthur , and the Knights of the Round Table , always more illustrious among the Scottish borderers , from their Welch origin , than Fin Maccoul , and Gow Macmorne , who seem not , however , to have been totally unknown , yielded gradually to the renown of Wallace , Bruce , Douglas , and the other patriots , who so nobly asserted the liberty of their country .— Beyond that period , numerous , but obscure and varying legends , refer to the marvellous Merlin , or Myrrdin the Wild , and Michael Scot , both magicians of notorious fame . In this instance the enchanters have triumphed over the true man . But the charge of magic was transferred from the ancient sorcerers to the objects of popular resentment of every age ; and the partizans of the Baliols , the abettors of the English faction , and the enemies of the protestant , and of the presbyterian reformation , have been indiscriminately stigmatized as necromancers and warlocks . Thus , Lord Soulis , Archbishop Sharp , Grierson of Lagg , and Graham of Claverhouse , Viscount Dundee , receive from tradition the same supernatural attributes . According to Dalrymple ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 65 ]</span>the family of Soulis seem to have been powerful during the contest between Bruce and Baliol ; for adhering to the latter of whom they incurred forfeiture . Their power extended over the south and west marches ; and near Deadrigs ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 66 ]</span>in the parish of Eccles , in the east marches , their family-bearings still appear on an obelisk . William de Soulis , Justiciarius Laodoniae , in 1281 , subscribed the famous obligation , by which the nobility of Scotland bound themselves to acknowledge the sovereignty of the Maid of Norway , and her descendants . RHYMER , Tom . II . pp . 266 , 279 ; and , in 1291 , Nicholas de Soulis appears as a competitor for the crown of Scotland , which he claimed as the heir of Margery , a bastard daughter of Alexander II ., and wife of Allan Durward , or Chuissier .— CARTE , p. 177 . DALRYMPLE 'S Annals , Vol . I. p. 203 .</p>
   <p>But their power was not confined to the marches ; for the barony of Saltoun , in the shire of Haddington , derived its name from the family ; being designed Soulistoun , in a charter to the predecessors of Nevoy of that ilk , seen by Dalrymple ; and the same frequently appears among those of the benefactors and witnesses in the chartularies of abbeys , particularly in that of Newbottle . Ranulphus de Soulis occurs as a witness , in a charter , granted by King David , of the teindis of Stirling ; and he , or one of his successors , had afterwards the appellation of Pincerna Regis . The following notices of the family and its decline , are extracted from Robertson 's Index of Lost Charters .<span type="note_anchor">[ 67 ]</span>Various repetitions occur , as the index is copied from different rolls , which appear to have never been accurately arranged .</p>

   <p>The hero of tradition seems to be William , Lord Soullis , whose name occurs so frequently in the foregoing list of forfeitures ; by which he appears to have possessed the whole district of Liddesdale , with Westerkirk and Kirkandrews , in Dumfries-shire , the lands of Gilmertoun , near Edinburgh , and the rich baronies of Nisbet , Longnewton , Caverton , Maxtoun , and Mertoun , in Roxburghshire . He was of royal descent , being the grandson of Nicholas de Soulis , who claimed the crown of Scotland , in right of his grandmother , daughter to Alexander II . ; and who , could her legitimacy have been ascertained , must have excluded the other competitors . The elder brother of William , was John de Soulis , a gallant warrior , warmly attached to the interests of his country , who , with fifty borderers , defeated and made prisoner Sir Andrew Harclay , at the head of three hundred Englishmen ; and was himself slain , fighting in the cause of Edward the Bruce , at the battle of Dundalk , in Ireland , 1318 . He had been joint-warden of the kingdom with John Cummin , after the abdication of the immortal Wallace , in 1300 ; in which character he was recognised by John Baliol , who , in a charter granted after his dethronement , and dated at Rutherglen , in the ninth year of his reign ( 1302 ) , styles him “ Custos regni “ nostri . ” The treason of William , his successor , occasioned the downfall of the family . This powerful baron entered into a conspiracy against Robert the Bruce , in which many persons of rank were engaged . The object , according to Barbour , was to elevate Lord Soulis to the Scottish throne . The plot was discovered by the Countess of Strathern . Lord Soulis was seized at Berwick , although he was attended , says Barbour , by three hundred and sixty squires , besides many gallant knights . Having confessed his guilt , in full parliament , his life was spared by the king ; but his domains were forfeited , and he himself confined in the castle of Dumbarton , where he died . Many of his accomplices were executed ; among others , the gallant David de Brechin , nephew to the king , whose sole crime was having concealed the treason , in which he disdained to participate .<span type="note_anchor">[ 68 ]</span>The parliament , in which so much noble blood was shed , was long remembered by the name of the Black Parliament . It was held in the year 1320 .</p>
   <p>From this period the family of Soulis makes no figure in our annals . Local tradition , however , more faithful to the popular sentiment than history , has recorded the character of their chief , and attributed to him many actions which seem to correspond with that character . His portrait is by no means flattering ; uniting every quality which could render strength formidable , and cruelty detestable . Combining prodigious bodily strength with cruelty , avarice , dissimulation , and treachery , is it surprising that a people , who attributed every event of life , in a great measure , to the interference of good or evil spirits , should have added to such a character the mystical horrors of sorcery ? Thus , he is represented as a cruel tyrant and sorcerer ; constantly employed in oppressing his vassals , harassing his neighbours , and fortifying his castle of Hermitage against the king of Scotland ; for which purpose he employed all means , human and infernal : invoking the fiends , by his incantations , and forcing his vassals to drag materials , like beasts of burden . Tradition proceeds to relate , that the Scottish king , irritated by reiterated complaints , peevishly exclaimed to the petitioners , “ Boil him , if you please , but let me hear no more of him . ” Satisfied with this answer , they proceeded with the utmost haste to execute the commission ; which they accomplished , by boiling him alive on the Nine-stane Rig , in a cauldron , said to have been long preserved at Skelf-hill , a hamlet betwixt Hawick and the Hermitage . Messengers , it is said , were immediately dispatched by the king , to prevent the effects of such a hasty declaration ; but they only arrived in time to witness the conclusion of the ceremony . The castle of Hermitage , unable to support the load of iniquity , which had been long accumulating within its walls , is supposed to have partly sunk beneath the ground ; and its ruins are still regarded by the peasants with peculiar aversion and terror . The door of the chamber , where Lord Soulis is said to have held his conferences with the evil spirits , is supposed to be opened once in seven years , by that daemon , to which , when he left the castle , never to return , he committed the keys , by throwing them over his left shoulder , and desiring it to keep them till his return . Into this chamber , which is really the dungeon of the castle , the peasant is afraid to look ; for such is the active malignity of its inmate , that a willow , inserted at the chinks of the door , is found peeled , or stripped of its bark , when drawn back . The Nine-stane Rig , where Lord Soulis was boiled , is a declivity , about one mile in breadth , and four in length , descending upon the water of Hermitage , from the range of hills which separate Liddesdale and Teviotdale . It derives its name from one of those circles of large stones , which are termed Druidical , nine of which remained to a late period . Five of these stones are still visible ; and two are particularly pointed out , as those which supported the iron bar , upon which the fatal cauldron was suspended .</p>
   <p>The formation of ropes of sand , according to popular tradition , was a work of such difficulty , that it was assigned by Michael Scot to a number of spirits , for which it was necessary for him to find some interminable employment . Upon discovering the futility of their attempts to accomplish the work assigned , they petitioned their task-master to be allowed to mingle a few handfuls of barley-chaff with the sand . On his refusal , they were forced to leave untwisted the ropes which they had shaped . Such is the traditionary hypothesis of the vermicular ridges of the sand on the shore of the sea .</p>
   <p>Redcap is a popular appellation of that class of spirits which haunt old castles . Every ruined tower in the south of Scotland is supposed to have an inhabitant of this species .</p>

   <p>NOTES</p>
   <p>ON</p>
   <p>LORD SOULIS .</p>
   <p>BY THE EDITOR .</p>
   <p>The tradition regarding the death of Lord Soulis , however singular , is not without a parallel in the real history of Scotland . The same extraordinary mode of cookery was actually practised ( horresco referens ) upon the body of a sheriff of the Mearns . This person , whose name was Melville of Glenbervie , bore his faculties so harshly , that he became detested by the barons of the country . Reiterated complaints of his conduct having been made to James I . ( or , as others say , to the Duke of Albany ) , the monarch answered , in a moment of unguarded impatience , “ Sorrow gin the sheriff were sodden , and supped in broo ’ ! ” The complainers retired , perfectly satisfied . Shortly after , the lairds of Arbuthnot , Mather , Laurestoun , and Pittaraw , decoyed Melville to the top of the hill of Garvock , above Lawrencekirk , under pretence of a grand hunting party . Upon this place ( still called the Sheriff 's Pot ) , the barons had prepared a fire and a boiling cauldron , into which they plunged the unlucky sheriff . After he was sodden ( as the king termed it ) , for a sufficient time , the savages , that they might literally observe the royal mandate , concluded the scene of abomination , by actually partaking of the hell-broth .</p>
   <p>The three lairds were outlawed for this offence ; and Barclay , one of their number , to screen himself from justice , erected the kaim ( i. e . the camp , or fortress ) of Mathers , which stands upon a rocky , and almost inaccessible peninsula , overhanging the German ocean . The laird of Arbuthnot is said to have eluded the royal vengeance , by claiming the benefit of the law of clan Macduff , concerning which the curious reader will find some particulars subjoined . A pardon , or perhaps a deed of replegiation , founded upon that law , is said to be still extant among the records of the viscount of Arbuthnot .</p>
   <p>Pellow narrates a similar instance of atrocity , perpetrated after the death of Muley Ismael , emperor of Morocco , in 1727 , when the inhabitants of Old Fez , throwing off all allegiance to his successor , slew “ Alchyde Boel le Rosea , their old governor , boiling his flesh , and many , through spite , eating thereof , and throwing what they could not eat of it to the dogs . ” — See PELLOW 'S Travels in South Barbary . And we may add , to such tales , the oriental tyranny of Zenghis Khan , who immersed seventy Tartar Khans in as many boiling cauldrons .</p>
   <p>The punishment of boiling seems to have been in use among the English at a very late period , as appears from the following passage in STOWE 'S Chronicle :— “ The 17th of March ( 1524 ) , Margaret Davy , a maid , was boiled at Smithfield , for poisoning of three households that she had dwelled in . ” But unquestionably the usual practice of Smithfield cookery , about that period , was by a different application of fire .</p>
   <p>LAW OF CLAN MACDUFF .</p>
   <p>Though it is rather foreign to the proper subject of this work , many readers may not be displeased to have some account of the curious privilege enjoyed by the descendants of the famous Macduff , thane of Fife , and thence called the Law of the Clan , or family , bearing his name .</p>
   <p>When the revolution was accomplished , in which Macbeth was dethroned and slain , Malcolm , sensible of the high services of the thane of Fife , is said , by our historians , to have promised to grant the first three requests he should make . Macduff accordingly demanded , and obtained , first , that he and his successors , lords of Fife , should place the crown on the king 's head at his coronation ; secondly , that they should lead the vanguard of the army , whenever the royal banner was displayed ; and , lastly , this privilege of clan Macduff , whereby any person , being related to Macduff within the ninth degree , and having committed homicide in chaude melle ( without premeditation ) , should , upon flying to Macduff 's Cross , and paying a certain fine , obtain remission of their guilt . Such , at least , is the account given of the law by all our historians . Nevertheless , there seems ground to suspect , that the privilege did not amount to an actual and total remission of the crime , but only to a right of being exempted from all other courts of jurisdiction , except that of the lord of Fife . The reader is presented with an old document , in which the law of clan Macduff is pleaded on behalf of one of the ancestors of Moray of Abercairny ; and it is remarkable that he does not claim any immunity , but solely a right of being re-pledged , because his cause had already been tried by Robert earl of Fife , the sole competent judge . But the privilege of being answerable only to the chief of their own clan , was , to the descendants of Macduff , almost equivalent to an absolute indemnity .</p>
   <p>Macduff 's Cross was situated near Lindores , on the march dividing Fife from Strathern . The form of this venerable monument unfortunately offended the zeal of the reformer , Knox , and it was totally demolished by his followers . The pedestal , a solid block of stone , alone escaped the besom of destruction . It bore an inscription , which , according to the apocryphal account of Sir Robert Sibbald , was a mixture of Latin , Saxon , Danish , and old French . Skene has preserved two lines :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Propter Makgridim et hoc oblatum ,</l>
     <l n="2">Accipe Smeleridem super lampade limpidae labrum</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">Skene , de verb . sig . voce Clan Macduff .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The full inscription , real or pretended , may be found in Sir Robert Sibbald 's History of Fife , and in James Cunninghame 's Essay upon Macduff 's Cross , together with what is called a translation , or rather paraphrase , of the piebald jargon which composes it . In Gough 's edition of Camden 's Britannia , a different and more intelligible version is given , on the authority of a Mr Douglas of Newburgh . The cross was dedicated to a St Macgider . Around the pedestal are tumuli , said to be the graves of those , who , having claimed the privilege of the law , failed in proving their consanguinity to the thane of Fife . Such persons were instantly executed . The people of Newburgh believe , that the spectres of these criminals still haunt the ruined cross , and claim that mercy for their souls , which they had failed to obtain for their mortal existence .</p>
   <p>The late Lord Hailes gives it as his opinion , that the indulgence was only to last till the tenth generation from Macduff .</p>
   <p>Fordun and Wintoun state , that the fine , to be paid by the person taking sanctuary , was twenty-four merks for a gentleman , and twelve merks for a yeoman . Skene affirms it to be nine cows , and a colpindach ( i. e . a quey , or cow of one or two years old ) .— Fordun , lib . 5 , cap . 9 .; Wintoun 's Cronykel , b . 6 , ch . 19 .; Skene , ut supra . The last cited author avers , that he has seen an old evident , bearing , that Spens of Wormestoun , being of Macduff 's kin , enjoyed this privilege for the slaughter of one Kinnermonth . The following deed , of a like nature , is published from a copy , accurately transcribed from an original deed , in the hands of the late Mr Cuming , of the Herald-Office , Edinburgh , by Messrs Brown and Gibb , librarians to the Faculty of Advocates . The blanks are occasioned by some parts of the deed having been obliterated .</p>

     <l n="1">Alas ! that e'er thou raised'st thine eyes ,</l>
     <l n="2">Thine eyes to look on me .— P . 261. v. 5 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The idea of Lord Soulis ’ familiar seems to be derived from the curious story of the spirit Orthone and the lord of Corasse , which , I think , the reader will be pleased to see , in all its Gothic simplicity , as translated from Froissart , by the lord of Berners .</p>
   <p>“ It is great marveyle to consyder one thynge , the whiche was shewed to me in the earl of Foix house at Ortayse , of hym that enfourmed me of the busynesse at Juberothe ( Aljubarota , where the Spaniards , with their French allies , were defeated by the Portugueze , A. D. 1385 ) . He showed me one thyng that I have oftentymes thought on sithe , and shall do as longe as I live . As thys squyer told me that of trouthe the next day after the battayl was thus fought , at Juberoth , the erle of Foiz knewe it , whereof I had gret marveyle ; for the said Sonday , Monday , and Tuesday , the erle was very pensyf , and so sadde of chere , that no man could have a worde of hym . And all the same three days he wold nat issue out of his chambre , nor speke to any man , though they were never so nere about hym . And , on the Tuesday night , he called to him his brother Arnault Guyllyam , and sayd to hym , with a soft voice , ‘ Our men hath had to do , whereof I am sorrie ; for it is come of them , by their voyage , as I sayd or they departed . ’ Arnault Guyllyam , who was a sage knight , and knewe right well his brother 's condicions ( i. e . temper ) , stode still and gave none answere . And than the erle , who thought to declare his mind more plainlye , for long he had borne the trouble thereof in his herte , spake agayn more higher than he dyd before , and sayd , ‘ By God , Sir Arnault , it is as I saye , and shortely ye shall here tidynges thereof ; but the countrey of Byerne , this hundred yere , never lost such a losse , at no journey , as they have done now in Portugal . ’ — Dyvers knyghtes and squyers , that were there present , and herde hym say so , stode styll , and durst nat speke , but they remembered his wordes . And within a ten days after , they knewe the trouthe thereof , by such as had been at the busynesse , and there they shewed every thinge as it was fortuned at Juberoth . Than the erle renewed agayn his dolour , and all the countreye were in sorrowe , for they had lost their parentes , brethren , chyldren , and frendes . ‘ Saint Mary ! ’ quod I to the squyer that shewed me thys tale , ‘ how is it , that the earl of Foiz could know , on one daye , what was done , within a day or two before , beyng so farre off ? ’ — ‘ By my faythe , Sir , ’ quod he , ‘ as it appeared well , he knewe it . ’ — Than he is a diviner , ’ quod I , ‘ or els he hath messangers , that flyethe with the wynde , or he must needs have some craft . ’ The squyer began to laugh , and sayd , “ Surely he must know it , by some art of negromansye or otherwyse . To saye the trouthe , we cannot tell how it is , but by our ymaginacions . ’ — ‘ Sir , ’ quod I , ‘ suche ymaginacions as ye have therein , if it please you to shew me , I wold be gladde therof ; and if it be suche a thynge as ought to be secrete , I shall nat publysshe it , nor as long as I am in thys countrey I shall never speke worde thereof . ’ — ‘ I praye you therof , ’ quod the squyer , ‘ for I wolde nat it shulde be knowen , that I shulde speke thereof . But I shall shewe you , as dyvers men speketh secretelye , whan they be togyder as frendes . ’ Than he drew me aparte into a corner of the chapell at Ortayse , and then began his tale , and sayd :</p>
   <p>“ It is well a twenty yeares paste , that there was , in this countre , a barone , called Raymond , lorde of Corasse , whyche is a sevyn leagues from this towne of Ortayse . Thys lord of Corasse had that same tyme , a plee at Avygnon before the Pope , for the dysmes ( i. e . tithes ) of his churche , against a clerk , curate there ; the whiche priest was of Catelogne . He was a grete clerk , and claymed to have ryghte of the dysmes , in the towne of Corasse , which was valued to a hundred florens by the yere , and the ryghte that he had , he shewed and proved it ; and , by sentence diffynitive , Pope Urbane the fythe , in consistory generall , condempned the knighte , and gave judgement wyth the preest , and of this last judgment he had letters of the Pope , for his possession , and so rode tyll he came into Berne , and there shewed his letters and bulles of the Popes for his possession of his dysmes . The lord of Corasse had gret indignacion at this preest , and came to hym , and said , ‘ Maister Pers , or Maister Martin ( as his name was ) thinkest thou , that by reason of thy letters I will lose mine herytage — be nat so hardy , that thou take any thynge that is myne ; if thou do , it shall cost thee thy life . Go thy waye into some other place to get thee a benefyce , for of myne herytage thou gettest no parte , and ones for alwayes , I defende thee . ’ The clerk douted the knight , for he was a cruell man , therefore he durst nat parceyver .— Than he thoughte to return to Avignon , as he dyde ; but , whan he departed , he came to the knight , the lord of Corasse , and sayd , ‘ Sir , by force , and nat by ryght , ye take away from me the ryght of my churche , wherein you greatly hurt your conscience .— I am not so strong in this countrey as ye be ; but , sir , knowe , for trouthe , that as soon as I maye , I shall sende to you suche a champyon , whom ye shall doubte more than me . ’ The knight , who doubted nothyng his thretynges , said , ‘ God be with thee ; do what thou mayst ; I doute no more dethe than lyfe ; for all thy wordes , I wyll not lese mine herytage . ’ Thus , the clerk departed from the lord of Corasse , and went I cannot tell wheder to Avygnon or into Catalogne , and forgat nat the promise that he had made to the lord of Corasse or he departed . For whan the knight thoughte leest on hym , about a three monethes after , as the knyght laye on a nyght a-bedde in his castelle of Corasse , with the lady , there came to hym messangers invisible , and made a marvellous tempest and noise in the castell , that it seemed as thoughe the castell shulde have fallen downe , and strak gret strokes at his chambre dore , that the goode ladye , his wife , was soore afrayde . The knight herd alle , but he spoke no word thereof ; bycause he wolde shewe no abasshed corage , for he was hardy to abyde all adventures . Thys noyse and tempest was in sundry places of the castell , and dured a long space , and , at length , cessed for that nyght . Than the nexte mornyng , all the servants of the house came to the lord , whan he was risen , and sayd , ‘ Sir , have you nat herde this night , that we have done ? ’ The lord dissembled , and sayd , ‘ No ! I herd nothyng — what have you herde ? ’ Than they shewed him what noyse they hadde herde , and howe alle the vessel in the kechyn was overtowrned . Than the lord began to laugh , and sayd , ‘ Yea , sirs ! ye dremed , it was nothynge but the wynde . ’ — ‘ In the name of God ! ’ quod the ladye , ‘ I herde it well . ’ The next nyght there was as great noyse and greatter , and suche strokes gyven at his chambre dore and windows , as alle shulde have broken in pieces . The knyghte starte up out of his bedde , and wolde not lette , to demaunde who was at his chambre dore that tyme of the nyght ; and anone he was answered by a voyce that sayd , ‘ I am here . ’ Quod the knyght , ‘ Who sent thee hyder ? ’ — ‘ The clerk of Catelogne sent me hyder , ’ quod the voice , ‘ to whom thou dost gret wronge , for thou hast taken from hym the ryghtes of his benefyce ; I will nat leave thee in rest tylle thou haste made hym a good accompte , so that he be pleased . ’ Quod the knight , ‘ What is thy name , that thou art so good a messangere ? ’ Quod he , ‘ I am called Orthone . ’ — ‘ Orthone ! ’ quod the knight , ‘ the servyce of a clerke is lytell profyte for thee . He will putte thee to moche payne if thou beleve hym . I pray thee leave hym , and come and serve me ; and I shall give thee goode thanke . ’ Orthone was redy to aunswere , for he was inamours with the knyghte , and sayde , ‘ Woldest thou fayne have my servyce ? ’ — ‘ Yea , truly , ’ quod the knyghte , ‘ so thou do no hurte to any persone in this house . ’ — ‘ No more I will do , ’ quod Orthone , ‘ for I have no power to do any other yvell , but to awake thee out of thy slepe , or some other . ’ — ‘ Well , ’ quod the knyght , ‘ do as I telle thee , and we shall soone agree , and leave the yvill clerke , for there is no good thyng in him , but to put thee to payne ; therefore , come and serve me . ’ — ‘ Well , ’ quod Orthone , ‘ and sythe thou wilt have me , we are agreed . ’</p>
   <p>“ So this spyrite Orthone loved so the knight , that oftentymes he wold come and vysyte hym , while he lay in his bedde aslepe , and outher pull him by the eare , or els stryke at his chambre dore or windowe . And , whan the knyght awoke , than he wolde saye , ‘ Orthone , lat me slepe . ’ — ‘ Nay , ’ quod Orthone , ‘ that will I nat do , tyll I have shewed thee such tydinges as are fallen a-late . ’ The ladye , the knyghtes wyfe , wolde be sore afrayed , that her heer wald stand up , and hyde herself under the clothes . Than the knyght wolde saye , ‘ Why , what tidynges hast thou brought me ? ’ — Quod Orthone , ‘ I am come out of England , or out of Hungry , or some other place , and yesterday I came hens , and such things are fallen , or such other . ’ So thus the lord of Corasse knewe , by Orthone , every thing that was done in any part of the worlde . And in this case he contynued a fyve yere , and could not kepe his own counsayle , but at last discovered it to the Erle of Foiz . I shall shewe you howe .</p>
   <p>“ The firste yere , the lord of Corasse came on a day to Ortayse , to the Erle of Foiz , and sayd to him , ‘ Sir , such things are done in England , or in Scotland , or in Almagne , or in any other countrey . ’ And ever the Erle of Foiz found his sayeing true , and had great marveyle how he shulde knowe such things so shortly . And , on a tyme the Erle of Foiz examined him so straitly , that the lord of Corasse shewed hym alle toguyder howe he knewe it , and howe he came to hym firste . When the Erle of Foiz hard that , he was joyfull , and said , Sir of Corasse , kepe him well in your love ; I wolde I hadd suche an messanger ; he costeth you nothyng , and ye knowe by him every thynge that is done in the worlde . ’ The knyght answered , and sayd , ‘ Sir , that is true . ’ Thus , the lord of Corasse was served with Orthone a long season . I can nat saye if this Orthone hadde any more masters or nat ; but every weke , twise or thrisse , he wolde come and vysite the lord of Corasse , and wolde shewe hym such tidyngs of any thing that was fallen fro whens he came . And ever the lord of Corasse , when he knewe any thynge , he wrote thereof to the Erle of Foiz , who had great joy thereof ; for he was the lord , of all the worlde , that most desyred to here news out of straunge places . And , on a tyme , the lord of Corasse was wyth the Erle of Foiz , and the erle demaunded of hym , and sayd , ‘ Sir of Corasse , dyd ye ever as yet se your messengere ? ’ — ‘ Nay , surely , sir , ’ quod the knyghte , ‘ nor I never desyred it . ’ — ‘ That is marveyle , ’ quod the erle ; ‘ if I were as well acquainted with him as ye be , I wolde have desyred to have sene hym ; wherefore , I pray you , desyre it of hym , and then telle me what form and facyon he is of . I have herd you say howe he speketh as good Gascon as outher you or I . ’ — ‘ Truely , sir , ’ quod the knyght , ‘ so it is : he speketh as well , and as fayr , as any of us both do . And surely , sir , sithe ye counsayle me , I shall do my payne to see him as I can . ’ And so , on a night , as he lay in his bedde , with the ladye his wife , who was so inured to here Orthone , that she was no longer afrayd of him ; than cam Orthone , and pulled the lord by the eare , who was fast asleep , and therewith he awoke , and asked who was there ? ‘ I am here , ’ quod Orthone . Then he demaunded , ‘ From whens comest thou nowe ? ’ — ‘ I come , ’ quod Orthone , ‘ from Prague , in Eoesme . ’ — ‘ How farre is that hens ? ’ quod the knyght . ‘ A threescore days journey , ’ quod Orthone . ‘ And art thou come hens so soon ? ’ quod the knyght . ‘ Yea truely , ’ quod Orthone , ‘ I come as fast as the wynde , or faster . ’ — ‘ Hast thou than winges ? ’ quod the knyght . ‘ Nay , truely , ’ quod he . ‘ How canst thou than flye so fast ? ’ quod the knyght . ‘ Ye have nothing to do to knowe that , ’ quod Orthone . ‘ No ? ’ quod the knyght , ‘ I wolde gladly se thee , to know what forme thou art of . ’ — ‘ Well , ’ quod Orthone , ‘ ye have nothing to do to knowe : it sufficeth you to here me , and to shewe you tidynges . ’ — ‘ In faythe , ’ quod the knyght , ‘ I wolde love the moche better an I myght se thee ones . ’ — ‘ Well , ’ quod Orthone , ‘ sir , sithe ye have so gret desyre to se me , the first thynge that ye se to-morrowe , whan ye ryse out of your bedde , the same shall be I . ’ — ‘ That is sufficient , ’ quod the lorde . ‘ Go thy way ; I gyve thee leave to departe for this nyght . ’ And the next mornynge the lord rose , and the ladye his wyfe was so afrayd , that she durst not ryse , but fayned herself sicke , and sayd she wolde not ryse . Her husband wolde have had her to have rysen . ‘ Sir , ’ quod she , ‘ than shall I se Orthone , and I wolde not se him by my gode wille . ’ — ‘ Well , ’ quod the knyght , ‘ I wolde gladly se hym . ’ And so he arose , fayre and easily , out of his bedde , and sat down on his bedde-syde , wenying to have sene Orthone in his owne proper form ; but he sawe nothynge wherbye he myght saye , ‘ Lo , yonder is Orthone . ’ So that day past , and the next night came , and when the knyght was in his bedde , Orthone came , and began to speke , as he was accustomed . ‘ Go thy waye , ’ quod the knyght , ‘ thou arte but a lyer ; thou promysest that I shuld have sene the , and it was not so . ’ — ‘ No ? ’ quod he , ‘ and I shewed myself to the . ’ — ‘ That is not so , ’ quod the lord . ‘ Why , ’ quod Orthone , ‘ whan ye rose out of your bedde , sawe ye nothynge ? ’ Than the lorde studyed a lytell , and advysed himself well . ‘ Yes , truely , ’ quod the knyght , ‘ now I remember me , as I sate on my bedde-syde , thynking on thee , I sawe two strawes upon the pavement , tumblynge one upon another . ’ — ‘ That same was I , ’ quod Orthone , ‘ into that fourme I dyd putte myself as than . ’ — ‘ That is not enough to me , ’ quod the lord ; ‘ I pray thee putte thyselfe into same other fourme , that I may better se and knowe thee . ’ — ‘ Well , ’ quod Orthone , ‘ ye will do so muche , that ye will lose me , and I to go fro you , for ye desyre to moch of me . ’ — ‘ Nay , ’ quod the knyght , ‘ thou shalt not go fro me , let me se thee ones , and I will desyre no more . ’ — ‘ Well , ’ quod Orthone , ‘ ye shall se me to-morrowe ; take hede , the first thyng that ye se after ye be out of your chamber , it shall be I . ’ — ‘ Well , ’ quod the knyght , ‘ I am then content . Go thy way , lette me slepe . ’ And so Orthone departed , and the next mornyng the lord arose , and yssued oute of his chambre , and wente to a windowe , and looked downe into the courte of the castell , and cast about his eyen . And the firste thyng he sawe was a sowe , the greattest that ever he sawe ; and she seemed to be so leane and yvell-favoured , that there was nothyng on her but the skynne , and the bones , with long eares , and a long leane snout . The lord of Corasse had marveyle of that leane sowe , and was wery of the sighte of her , and comaunded his men to fetch his houndes , and sayd , ‘ Let the dogges hunt her to dethe , and devour her . ’ His servaunts opened the kenells , and lette oute his houndes , and dyd sette them on this sowe . And , at the last , the sowe made a great crye , and looked up to the lord of Corasse as he looked out at a windowe , and so sodaynely vanyshed awaye , no man wyste howe . Than the lord of Corasse entred into his chambre , right pensyve , and than he remembered hym of Orthone , his messangere , and sayd , ‘ I repent me that I set my houndes on him . It is an adventure , an I here any more of hym ; for he sayd to me oftentymes , that if I displeased hym , I shulde lose hym . ’ The lord sayd trouthe , for never after he came into the castell of Corasse , and also the knyght dyed the same yere next followinge . ”</p>
   <p>“ So , sir , ” said the squyer , “ thus have I shewed you the lyfe of Orthone , and howe , for a season , he served the lord of Corasse with newe tidynges . ” — “ It is true , sir , ” sayd I , “ but nowe , as to your firste purpose . Is the Earl of Foiz served with suche an messangere ? ” — “ Surely , ” quod the squyer , it is the ymaginacion of many , that he hath such messengers , for ther is nothynge done in any place , but and he sette his mynde thereto , he will knowe it , and whan men thynke leest thereof . And so dyd he , when the goode knightes and squyers of this country were slayne in Portugale at Juberothe . Some saythe , the knowledge of such thynges hath done hym moche profyte , for and there be but the value of a spone lost in his house , anone he will know where it is . ’ So , thus , then I toke leave of the squyer , and went to other company ; but I bare well away his tale . ” — BOURCHIER 'S Translation of Froissart 's Chronycle , Vol . II . chap . 37 .</p>

     <l n="1">He took the keys from the rusty lock ,</l>
     <l n="2">That never was ta'en before .</l>
     <l n="3">He threw them o'er his left shoulder ,</l>
     <l n="4">With mickle care and pain ;</l>
     <l n="5">And he bade it keep them , fathoms deep ,</l>
     <l n="6">Till he returned again .— P . 262 , v. 1 . 2 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The circumstance of Lord Soulis having thrown the key over his left shoulder , and bid the fiend keep it till his return , is noted in the introduction , as a part of his traditionary history . In the course of this autumn ( 1806 ) , the Earl of Dalkeith being encamped near the Hermitage Castle , for the amusement of shooting , directed some workmen to clear away the rubbish from the door of the dungeon , in order to ascertain its ancient dimensions and architecture . To the great astonishment of the labourers , and of the country people who were watching their proceedings , a rusty iron key , of considerable size , was found among the ruins , a little way from the dungeon door . The well-known tradition instantly passed from one to another ; and it was generally agreed , that the malevolent daemon , who had so long retained possession of the key of the castle , now found himself obliged to resign it to the heir-apparent of the domain . In the course of their researches , a large iron ladle , somewhat resembling that used by plumbers , was also discovered ; and both the reliques are now in Lord Dalkeith 's possession .</p>
   <p>In the summer of 1805 , another discovery was made in the haunted ruins of Hermitage . In a recess of the wall of the castle , intended apparently for receiving the end of a beam or joist , a boy , seeking for birds nests , found a very curious antique silver-ring , embossed with hearts , the well-known cognisance of the Douglas family , placed interchangeably with quatre-foils all round the circle . The workmanship has an uncommonly rude and ancient appearance , and warrants our believing that it may have belonged to one of the Earls of Angus , who carried the heart and quatre-foils<span type="note_anchor">[ 76 ]</span>in their arms . They parted with the castle and lordship of Liddesdale , in exchange for that of Bothwell , in the beginning of the 16th century . This ring is now in the editor 's possession , by the obliging gift of Mr John Ballantyne , of the house of Ballantyne and Company , so distinguished for typography .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 68 ]</span>As the people thronged to the execution of the gallant youth , they were bitterly rebuked by Sir Ingram de Umfraville , an English or Norman knight , then a favourite follower of Robert Bruce . “ Why press you , ” said he , “ to see the dismal catastrophe of so generous a knight ? I have seen ye throng as eagerly around him to share his bounty , as now to behold his death . ” With these words he turned from the scene of blood , and , repairing to the king , craved leave to sell his Scottish possessions , and to retire from the country . “ My heart , ” said Umfraville , “ will not , for the wealth of the world , permit me to dwell any longer , where I have seen such a knight die by the hands of the executioner . ” With the king 's leave , he interred the body of David de Brechin , sold his lands , and left Scotland for ever .

   <p>THE COUT OF KEELDAR .</p>
   <p>BY J. LEYDEN .</p>
   <p>The tradition on which the following ballad is founded , derives considerable illustration from the argument of the preceding . It is necessary to add , that the most redoubted adversary of Lord Soulis was the Chief of Keeldar , a Northumbrian district , adjacent to Cumberland , who perished in a sudden encounter on the banks of the Hermitage . Being arrayed in armour of proof , he sustained no hurt in the combat ; but stumbling in retreating across the river , the hostile party held him down below water with their lances till he died ; and the eddy , in which he perished , is still called the Cout of Keeldar 's Pool . His grave , of gigantic size , is pointed out on the banks of the Hermitage , at the western corner of a wall , surrounding the burial-ground of a ruined chapel . As an enemy of Lord Soulis , his memory is revered ; and the popular epithet of Cout , i. e . Colt , is expressive of his strength , stature , and activity . Tradition likewise relates , that the young chief of Mangerton , to whose protection Lord Soulis had , in some eminent jeopardy , been indebted for his life , was decoyed by that faithless tyrant into his castle of Hermitage , and insidiously murdered at a feast .</p>
   <p>The Keeldar Stone , by which the Northumbrian chief passed in his incursion , is still pointed out , as a boundary mark , on the confines of Jed forest , and Northumberland . It is a rough insulated mass , of considerable dimensions , and it is held unlucky to ride thrice withershins<span type="note_anchor">[ 77 ]</span>around it . Keeldar Castle is now a hunting seat , belonging to the Duke of Northumberland .</p>
   <p>The Brown Man of the Muirs is a Fairy of the most malignant order , the genuine duergar . Walsingham mentions a story of an unfortunate youth , whose brains were extracted from his skull , during his sleep , by this malicious being . Owing to this operation , he remained insane many years , till the virgin Mary courteously restored his brains to their station .</p>

     <l n="1">‘ Tis formed of an earth-fast flint .— P . 287. v. 2 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>An earth-fast stone , or an insulated stone , inclosed in a bed of earth , is supposed to possess peculiar properties . It is frequently applied to sprains and bruises , and used to dissipate swellings ; but its blow is reckoned uncommonly severe .</p>
   <p>Of adderstone the hilt .— P . 287. v. 3 .</p>
   <p>The adderstone , among the Scottish peasantry , is held in almost as high veneration , as , among the Gauls , the ovum anguinum , described by Pliny .— Natural History , l. xxix . c. 3 . The name is applied to celts , and other round perforated stones . The vulgar suppose them to be perforated by the stings of adders .</p>
   <p>With the leaves of the rowan tree .— P . 287. v. 4 .</p>
   <p>The rowan tree , or mountain ash , is still used by the peasantry , to avert the effects of charms and witchcraft . An inferior degree of the same influence is supposed to reside in many evergreens ; as the holly , and the bay . With the leaves of the bay , the English and Welch peasants were lately accustomed to adorn their doors at midsummer .— Vide BRAND 's Vulgar Antiquities .</p>
   <p>And shakes the rocking stone .— P . 291. v. 1 .</p>
   <p>The rocking stone , commonly reckoned a Druidical monument , has always been held in superstitious veneration by the people . The popular opinion , which supposes them to be inhabited by a spirit , coincides with that of the ancient Icelanders , who worshipped the daemons , which they believed to inhabit great stones . It is related in the Kristni Saga , chap . 2 , that the first Icelandic bishop , by chaunting a hymn over one of these sacred stones , immediately after his arrival in the island , split it , expelled the spirit , and converted its worshippers to Christianity . The herb vervain , revered by the Druids , was also reckoned a powerful charm by the common people ; and the author recollects a popular rhyme , supposed to be addressed to a young woman by the devil , who attempted to seduce her in the shape of a handsome young man :</p>

   <p>Castles , remarkable for size , strength , and antiquity , are , by the common people , commonly attributed to the Picts , or Pechs , who are not supposed to have trusted solely to their skill in masonry , in constructing these edifices , but are believed to have bathed the foundation-stone with human blood , in order to propitiate the spirit of the soil . Similar to this is the Gaelic tradition , according to which St Columba is supposed to have been forced to bury St Oran alive , beneath the foundation of his monastery , in order to propitiate the spirits of the soil , who demolished by night what was built during the day .</p>
   <p>And , if the bull 's ill-omened head , &amp; c .— P. 294. v. 2 .</p>
   <p>To present a bull 's head before a person at a feast , was , in the ancient turbulent times of Scotland , a common signal for his assassination . Thus , Lindsay of Pitscottie relates in his History , p. 17 , that “ efter the dinner was endit , once alle the delicate courses taken away , the chancellor ( Sir William Crichton ) presentit the bullis head befoir the Earle of Douglas , in signe and toaken of condemnation to the death . ”</p>

   <p>That alluded to in the following verse , is a wild fanciful popular tale of enchantment , termed “ The Black Bull of Noroway . ” The author is inclined to believe it the same story with the romance of the “ Three Futtit Dog of Noroway , ” the title of which is mentioned in the Complaynt of Scotland .</p>

   <p>The author is unable to produce any authority , that the execrable machine , the sword-mill , so well known on the continent , was ever employed in Scotland ; but he believes the vestiges of something very similar have been discovered in the ruins of old castles .</p>
   <p>No spell can stay the living tide .— P . 297. v. 3 .</p>
   <p>That no species of magic had any effect over a running stream , was a common opinion among the vulgar , and is alluded to in Burns 's admirable tale of Tam o ’ Shanter .</p>

   <p>GLENFINLAS ,</p>
   <p>OR</p>
   <p>LORD RONALD 'S CORONACH .<span type="note_anchor">[ 80 ]</span></p>
   <p>BY THE EDITOR .</p>
   <p>The simple tradition , upon which the following stanzas are founded , runs thus : While two Highland hunters were passing the night in a solitary bathy ( a hut , built for the purpose of hunting ) , and making merry over their venison and whisky , one of them expressed a wish , that they had pretty lasses to complete their party . The words were scarcely uttered , when two beautiful young women , habited in green , entered the hut , dancing and singing . One of the hunters was seduced by the syren , who attached herself particularly to him , to leave the hut : the other remained , and , suspicious of the fair seducers , continued to play upon a trump , or Jew 's harp , some strain , consecrated to the Virgin Mary . Day at length came , and the temptress vanished . Searching in the forest , he found the bones of his unfortunate friend , who had been torn to pieces and devoured by the fiend , into whose toils he had fallen . The place was from thence called the Glen of the Green Women .</p>
   <p>Glenfinlas is a tract of forest-ground , lying in the Highlands of Perthshire , not far from Callender , in Menteith . It was formerly a royal forest , and now belongs to the Earl of Moray . This country , as well as the adjacent district of Balquidder , was , in times of yore , chiefly inhabited by the Macgregors . To the west of the forest of Glenfinlas lies Loch Katrine , and its romantic avenue , called the Troshachs . Benledi , Benmore , and Benvoirlich , are mountains in the same district , and at no great distance from Glenfinlas . The river Teith passes Callender and the castle of Doune , and joins the Forth near Stirling . The pass of Lenny is immediately above Callender , and is the principal access to the Highlands , from that town . Glenartney is a forest , near Benvoirlich .

   <p>The fires lighted by the Highlanders on the first of May , in compliance with a custom derived from the Pagan times , are termed , The Beltane-Tree . It is a festival celebrated with various superstitious rites , both in the north of Scotland and in Wales .</p>

   <p>I can only describe the second sight , by adopting Dr Johnson 's definition , who calls it “ An impression , either by the mind upon the eye , or by the eye upon the mind , by which things distant and future are perceived and seen as if they were present . ” To which I would only add , that the spectral appearances , thus presented , usually presage misfortune ; that the faculty is painful to those who suppose they possess it ; and that they usually acquire it , while themselves under the pressure of melancholy .</p>
   <p>Will good St Oran 's rule prevail .— P . 310. v. 1 .</p>
   <p>St Oran was a friend and follower of St Columba , and was buried in Icolmkill . His pretensions to be a saint were rather dubious . According to the legend , he consented to be buried alive , in order to propitiate certain daemons of the soil , who obstructed the attempts of Columba to build a chapel . Columba caused the body of his friend to be dug up , after three days had elapsed ; when Oran , to the horror and scandal of the assistants , declared , that there was neither a God , a judgment , nor a future state ! He had no time to make further discoveries , for Columba caused the earth once more to be shovelled over him with the utmost dispatch . The chapel , however , and the cemetery , was called Reilig Ouran ; and , in memory of his rigid celibacy , no female was permitted to pay her devotions , or be buried , in that place . This is the rule alluded to in the poem .</p>
   <p>And thrice St Fillan 's powerful prayer .— P . 316. v. 5 .</p>
   <p>St Fillan has given his name to many chapels , holy fountains , &amp; c. in Scotland . He was , according to Camerarius , an abbot of Pittenweem , in Fife ; from which situation he retired , and died a hermit in the wilds of Glenurchy , A. D. 649 . While engaged in transcribing the Scriptures , his left hand was observed to send forth such a splendour , as to afford light to that with which he wrote ; a miracle which saved many candles to the convent , as St Fillan used to spend whole nights in that exercise . The 9th of January was dedicated to this saint , who gave his name to Kilfillan , in Renfrew , and St Phillans , or Forgend , in Fife . Lesley , lib . 7 ., tells us , that Robert the Bruce was possessed of Fillan 's miraculous and luminous arm , which he inclosed in a silver shrine , and had it carried at the head of his army . Previous to the battle of Bannockburn , the king 's chaplain , a man of little faith , abstracted the relique , and deposited it in some place of security , lest it should fall into the hands of the English . But , lo ! while Robert was addressing his prayers to the empty casket , it was observed to open and shut suddenly ; and , on inspection , the saint was found to have himself deposited his arm in the shrine , as an assurance of victory . Such is the tale of Lesley . But though Bruce little needed that the arm of St Fillan should assist his own , he dedicated to him , in gratitude , a priory at Killin , upon Loch Tay .</p>
   <p>In the Scots Magazine for July 1802 , ( a national periodical publication , which has lately revived with considerable energy ,) there is a copy of a very curious crown grant , dated 11th July , 1487 , by which James III . confirms to Malice Doire , an inhabitant of Strathfillan , in Perthshire , the peaceable exercise and enjoyment of a relique of St Fillan , called the Quegrich , which he , and his predecessors , are said to have possessed since the days of Robert Bruce . As the Quegrich was used to cure diseases , this document is , probably , the most ancient patent ever granted for a quack medicine . The ingenious correspondent , by whom it is furnished , further observes , that additional particulars , concerning St Fillan , are to be found in Ballenden 's Boece , Book 4. folio ccxiii ., and in PENNANT 's Tour in Scotland , 1772 , pp . 11 . 15 .</p>

   <p>THE MERMAID .</p>
   <p>J. LEYDEN .</p>
   <p>The following poem is founded upon a Gaelic traditional ballad , called Macphail of Colonsay , and the Mermaid of Corrivrekin . The dangerous gulf of Corrivrekin lies between the islands of Jura and Scarba , and the superstition of the islanders has tenanted its shelves and eddies with all the fabulous monsters and daemons of the ocean . Among these , according to a universal tradition , the Mermaid is the most remarkable . In her dwelling , and in her appearance , the mermaid of the northern nations resembles the syren of the ancients . The appendages of a comb and mirror are probably of Celtic invention .</p>
   <p>The Gaelic story bears , that Macphail of Colonsay was carried off by a mermaid , while passing the gulf above mentioned : that they resided together , in a grotto beneath the sea , for several years , during which time she bore him five children : but , finally , he tired of her society , and , having prevailed upon her to carry him near the shore of Colonsay , he escaped to land .</p>
   <p>The inhabitants of the Isle of Man have a number of such stories , which may be found in Waldron . One bears , that a very beautiful mermaid fell in love with a young shepherd , who kept his flocks beside a creek , much frequented by these marine people . She frequently caressed him , and brought him presents of coral , fine pearls , and every valuable production of the ocean . Once upon a time , as she threw her arms eagerly round him , he suspected her of a design to draw him into the sea , and , struggling hard , disengaged himself from her embrace , and ran away . But the mermaid resented either the suspicion , or the disappointment , so highly , that she threw a stone after him , and flung herself into the sea , whence she never returned . The youth , though but slightly struck with the pebble , felt , from that moment , the most excruciating agony , and died at the end of seven days .— Waldron 's Works , p. 176 .</p>
   <p>Another tradition of the same island affirms , that one of these amphibious damsels was caught in a net , and brought to land , by some fishers , who had spread a snare for the denizens of the ocean . She was shaped like the most beautiful female down to the waist , but below trailed a voluminous fish 's tail , with spreading fins . As she would neither eat nor speak , ( though they knew she had the power of language ) , they became apprehensive that the island would be visited with some strange calamity , if she should die for want of food ; and therefore , on the third night , they left the door open , that she might escape . Accordingly , she did not fail to embrace the opportunity ; but , gliding with incredible swiftness to the sea-side , she plunged herself into the waters , and was welcomed by a number of her own species , who were heard to enquire , what she had seen among the natives of the earth ; “ Nothing , ” she answered , “ wonderful , except that they were silly enough to throw away the water in which they had boiled their eggs . ”</p>
   <p>Collins , in his notes upon the line ,</p>
   <p>“ Mona , long hid from those who sail the main , ”</p>
   <p>explains it , by a similar Celtic tradition . It seems , a mermaid had become so much charmed with a young man , who walked upon the beach , that she made love to him ; and , being rejected with scorn , she excited , by enchantment , a mist , which long concealed the island from all navigators .</p>
   <p>I must mention another Mankish tradition , because , being derived from the common source of Celtic mythology , they appear the most natural illustrations of the Hebridean tale . About fifty years before Waldron went to reside in Man ( for there were living witnesses of the legend , when he was upon the island ) , a project was undertaken , to fish treasures up from the deep , by means of a diving-bell . A venturous fellow , accordingly , descended , and kept pulling for more rope , till all they had on board was expended . This must have been no small quantity , for a skilful mathematician , who was on board , judging from the proportion of line let down , declared , that the adventurer must have descended at least double the number of leagues which the moon is computed to be distant from the earth . At such a depth , wonders might be expected , and wonderful was the account given by the adventurer , when drawn up to the air .</p>
   <p>“ After , ” said he , “ I had passed the region of fishes , I descended into a pure element , clear as the air in the serenest and most unclouded day , through which , as I passed , I saw the bottom of the watery world , paved with coral , and a shining kind of pebbles , which glittered like the sun-beams , reflected on a glass . I longed to tread the delightful paths , and never felt more exquisite delight , than when the machine , I was inclosed in , grazed upon it .</p>
   <p>“ On looking through the little windows of my prison , I saw large streets and squares on every side , ornamented with huge pyramids of crystal , not inferior in brightness to the finest diamonds ; and the most beautiful building , not of stone , nor brick , but of mother-of-pearl , and embossed in various figures , with shells of all colours . The passage , which led to one of these magnificent apartments , being open , I endeavoured , with my whole strength , to move my enclosure towards it ; which I did , though with great difficulty , and very slowly . At last , however , I got entrance into a very spacious room , in the midst of which stood a large amber table , with several chairs round , of the same . The floor of it was composed of rough diamonds , topazes , emeralds , rubies , and pearls . Here I doubted not but to make my voyage as profitable as it was pleasant ; for , could I have brought with me but a few of these , they would have been of more value than all we could hope for in a thousand wrecks ; but they were so closely wedged in , and so strongly cemented by time , that they were not to be unfastened . I saw several chains , carcanets , and rings , of all manner of precious stones , finely cut , and set after our manner ; which I suppose had been the prize of the winds and waves : these were hanging loosely on the jasper walls , by strings made of rushes , which I might easily have taken down ; but , as I had edged myself within half a foot reach of them , I was unfortunately drawn back through your want of line . In my return , I saw several comely mermen , and beautiful mermaids , the inhabitants of this blissful realm , swiftly descending towards it ; but they seemed frighted at my appearance , and glided at a distance from me , taking me , no doubt , for some monstrous and new-created species . ” — Waldron , ibidem .</p>
   <p>It would be very easy to enlarge this introduction , by quoting a variety of authors , concerning the supposed existence of these marine people . The reader may consult the Telliamed of M. Maillet , who , in support of the Neptunist system of geology , has collected a variety of legends , respecting mermen and mermaids , p. 230 , et sequen . Much information may also be derived from Pontoppidan 's Natural History of Norway , who fails not to people her seas with this amphibious race .<span type="note_anchor">[ 85 ]</span>An older authority is to be found in the Kongs skugg-sio , or Royal Mirror , written , as it is believed , about 1170 . The mermen , there mentioned , are termed hafstrambur ( sea-giants ) , and are said to have the upper parts resembling the human race ; but the author , with becoming diffidence , declines to state , positively , whether they are equipped with a dolphin 's tail . The female monster is called Mar-Gyga ( sea-giantess ) , and is averred , certainly , to drag a fish 's train . She appears , generally , in the act of devouring fish , which she has caught . According to the apparent voracity of her appetite , the sailors pretended to guess what chance they had of saving their lives in the tempests , which always followed her appearance .— Speculum Regale , 1768 , p. 166 .</p>
   <p>Mermaids were sometimes supposed to be possessed of supernatural powers . Resenius , in his life of Frederick II ., gives us an account of a syren , who not only prophesied future events , but , as might have been expected from the element in which she dwelt , preached vehemently against the sin of drunkenness .</p>
   <p>The mermaid of Corrivrekin possessed the power of occasionally resigning her scaly train ; and the Celtic tradition bears , that when , from choice or necessity , she was invested with that appendage , her manners were more stern and savage than when her form was entirely human . Of course , she warned her lover not to come into her presence , when she was thus transformed . This belief is alluded to in the following ballad .</p>
   <p>The beauty of the syrens is celebrated in the old romances of chivalry . Doolin , upon beholding , for the first time in his life , a beautiful female , exclaims , “ Par sainte Marie , si belle creature ne vis je oncque en ma vie ! Je crois que c'est un ange du ciel , ou une seraine de mer ; Je crois que homme n'engendra oncque si belle creature . ” — La Fleur de Battailles .</p>

    <p n="2">THE MERMAID .</p>
    <p n="3">The sea-snake heave his snowy mane .— P . 334. v. 3 .</p>
    <p n="4">“ They , who , in works of navigation , on the coasts of Norway , employ themselves in fishing or merchandize , do all agree in this strange story , that there is a serpent there , which is of a vast magnitude , namely , two hundred feet long , and moreover twenty feet thick ; and is wont to live in rocks and caves , toward the sea-coast about Berge ; which will go alone from his holes , in a clear night in summer , and devours calves , lambs , and hogs ; or else he goes into the sea to feed on polypus , locusts , and all sorts of sea-crabs . He hath commonly hair hanging from his neck a cubit long , and sharp scales , and is black , and he hath flaming shining eyes . This snake disquiets the skippers , and he puts up his head on high , like a pillar , and catcheth away men , and he devours them ; and this hapneth not but it signifies some wonderful change of the kingdom near at hand ; namely , that the princes shall die , or be banished ; or some tumultuous wars shall presentlie follow . ” — Olaus Magnus , London , 1558 , rendered into English by J. S. Much more of the sea-snake may be learned from the credible witnesses cited by Pontoppidan , who saw it raise itself from the sea , twice as high as the mast of their vessel . The tradition probably originates in the immense snake of the Edda , whose folds were supposed to girdle the earth .</p>

    <p n="7">THE LORD HERRIES HIS COMPLAINT ,</p>
    <p n="8">A FRAGMENT .</p>
    <p n="9">NEVER BEFORE PUBLISHED .</p>
    <p n="10">BY CHARLES KIRKPATRICK SHARPE , ESQ . OF HODDOM .</p>
    <p n="11">Hoddom castle is delightfully situated on the banks of the river Annan . It is an ancient structure , said to have been built betwixt the years 1437 and 1484 , by John Lord Herries , of Herries , a powerful border baron , who possessed extensive domains in Dumfries-shire . This family continued to flourish until the death of William , Lord Herries , in the middle of the 16th century , when it merged in heirs female . Agnes , the eldest of the daughters of Lord William , was married to John , master of Maxwell , afterwards created Lord Herries , and a strenuous partizan of Queen Mary . The castle and barony of Hoddom were sold , about 1630 , and were then , or soon afterwards , acquired by John Sharpe , Esq ., in whose family they have ever since continued . Before the accession of James VI . to the English crown , Hoddom castle was appointed to be kept “ with ane wise stout man , and to have with him four well-horsed men , and there to have two stark footmen , servants , to keep their horses , and the principal to have ane stout footman . ” — Border Laws , Appendix .</p>
    <p n="12">On the top of a small , but conspicuous hill , near to Hoddom castle , there is a square tower , built of hewn stone , over the door of which are carved the figures of a dove and a serpent , and betwixt them the word Repentance . Hence the building , though its proper name is Trailtrow , is more frequently called the Tower of Repentance . It was anciently used as a beacon , and the border laws direct a watch to be maintained there , with a fire-pan and bell , to give the alarm when the English crossed , or approached , the river Annan . This man was to have a husband-land for his service .— SPOTTISWOODE , p. 306 .</p>
    <p n="13">Various accounts are given of the cause of erecting the Tower of Repentance . The following has been adopted by my ingenious correspondent , as most susceptible of poetical decoration . A certain Lord Herries — about the date of the transaction , tradition is silent — was famous among those who used to rob and steal ( convey , the wise it call ) . This lord , returning from England , with many prisoners , whom he had unlawfully enthralled , was overtaken by a storm , while passing the Solway Firth , and , in order to relieve his boat , he cut all their throats , and threw them into the sea . Feeling great qualms of conscience , he built this square tower , carving over the door , which is about half way up the building , and had formerly no stair to it , the figures above mentioned , of a dove and a serpent , emblems of remorse and grace , and the motto — “ Repentance . ”</p>
    <p n="14">I have only to add , that the marauding baron is said , from his rapacity , to have been surnamed John the Reif ; probably in allusion to a popular romance ; and that another account says , the sin , of which he repented , was the destruction of a church , or chapel , called Trailtrow , with the stones of which he had built the castle of Hoddom .— MACFARLANE 's MSS .</p>
    <p n="15">It is said , that Sir Richard Steele , while riding near this place , saw a shepherd boy reading his Bible , and asked him , what he learned from it ? “ The way to heaven , ” answered the boy . “ And can you show it to me ? ” said Sir Richard , in banter . “ You must go by that tower , ” replied the shepherd ; and he pointed to the tower of “ Repentance . ”</p>

    <p n="28">“ Soon did thy smile , sweet baby , stint , “ Torn frae the nurse 's knee , “ That smile , that might hae saften 'd flint , “ And still 'd the raging sea .</p>

    <p n="34">THE MURDER OF CAERLAVEROC .</p>
    <p n="35">NEVER BEFORE PUBLISHED .</p>
    <p n="36">BY CHARLES KIRKPATRICK SHARPE , ESQ .</p>
    <p n="37">The tragical event which preceded , or perhaps gave rise to , the successful insurrection of Robert Bruce , against the tyranny of Edward I ., is well known . In the year 1304 , Bruce abruptly left the court of England , and held an interview , in the Dominical church of Dumfries , with John , surnamed , from the colour of his hair , the Red Cuming , a powerful chieftain , who had formerly held the regency of Scotland . It is said , by the Scottish historians , that he upbraided Cuming with having betrayed to the English monarch a scheme , formed betwixt them , for asserting the independence of Scotland . The English writers maintain , that Bruce proposed such a plan to Cuming , which he rejected with scorn , as inconsistent with the fealty he had sworn to Edward . The dispute , however it began , soon waxed high betwixt two fierce and independent barons . At length , standing before the high altar of the church , Cuming gave Bruce the lie , and Bruce retaliated by a stroke of his poniard . Full of confusion and remorse , for a homicide committed in a sanctuary , the future monarch of Scotland rushed out of the church , with the bloody poniard in his hand . Kirkpatrick and Lindsay , two barons , who faithfully adhered to him , were waiting at the gate . To their earnest and anxious enquiries into the cause of his emotion , Bruce answered , “ I doubt I have slain the Red Cuming ” .— “ Doubtest thou ? ” exclaimed Kirkpatrick , “ I make sure ! "[ 87 ] Accordingly , with Lindsay and a few followers , he rushed into the church , and dispatched the wounded Cuming .</p>
    <p n="38">A homicide , in such a place , and such an age , could hardly escape embellishment from the fertile genius of the churchmen , whose interest was so closely connected with the inviolability of a divine sanctuary . Accordingly , Bowmaker informs us , that the body of the slaughtered baron was watched , during the night , by the Dominicans , with the usual rites of the church . But , at midnight , the whole assistants fell into a dead sleep , with the exception of one aged father , who heard , with terror and surprise , a voice , like that of a wailing infant , exclaim , “ How long , O Lord , shall vengeance be deferred ? ” it was answered , in an awful tone , “ Endure with patience , until the anniversary of this day shall return for the fifty-second time . ” In the year 1357 , fifty-two years after Cuming 's death , James of Lindsay was hospitably feasted in the castle of Caerlaveroc , in Dumfries-shire , belonging to Roger Kirkpatrick . They were the sons of the murderers of the regent . In the dead of night , for some unknown cause , Lindsay arose , and poniarded in his bed his unsuspecting host . He then mounted his horse to fly ; but guilt and fear had so bewildered his senses , that , after riding all night , he was taken , at break of day , not three miles from the castle , and was afterwards executed , by order of King David II .</p>
    <p n="39">The story of the murder is thus told by the prior of Lochlevin :—</p>
    <p n="40">That ilk yhere in our kynryk Hoge was slayne of Kilpatrik Be schyr Jakkis the Lyndessay In-til Karlaveroc ; and away For til have bene with all his mycht This Lyndyssay pressyt all a nycht Forth on hors rycht fast rydand .

    <p n="43">THE</p>
    <p n="44">MURDER OF CAERLAVEROC .</p>
    <p n="45">“ Now , come to me , my little page , “ Of wit sae wond'rous sly ! “ Ne'er under flower , o ’ youthfu ’ age , “ Did mair destruction lie .</p>
    <p n="46">“ I 'll dance and revel wi ’ the rest , “ Within this castle rare ; “ Yet he sall rue the drearie feast , “ Bot and his lady fair .</p>
    <p n="47">“ For ye maun drug Kirkpatrick 's wine , “ Wi ’ juice o ’ poppy flowers ; “ Nae mair he 'll see the morning shine “ Frae proud Caerlaveroc 's towers .</p>
    <p n="48">“ For he has twin 'd my love and me , “ Ihe maid of mickle scorn — “ She 'll welcome , wi ’ a tearfu ’ e'e , “ Her widowhood the morn .</p>
    <p n="49">“ And saddle weel my milk-white steed , “ Prepare my harness bright ! “ Giff I can mak my rival bleed , “ I 'll ride awa this night . ”</p>
    <p n="50">“ Now haste ye , master , to the ha ’ ! “ The guests are drinking there ; “ Kirkpatrick 's pride sall be but sma ’ , “ For a ’ his lady fair . ”</p>
    <p n="51">In came the merry minstrelsy ; Shrill harps wi ’ tinkling string , And bag-pipes , lilting melody , Made proud Caerlaveroc ring .</p>
    <p n="52">There gallant knights , and ladies bright , Did move to measures fine , Like frolic Fairies , jimp and light , Wha dance in pale moonshine .</p>
    <p n="53">The ladies glided through the ha ’ , Wi ’ footing swift and sure — Kirkpatrick 's dame outdid them a ’ , Whan she stood on the floor .</p>
    <p n="54">And some had tyres of gold sae rare , And pendants<span type="note_anchor">[ 89 ]</span>eight or nine ; And she , wi ’ but her gowden hair , Did a ’ the rest outshine .</p>
    <p n="55">And some , wi ’ costly diamonds sheen , Did warriors ’ hearts assail — But she , wi ’ her twa sparkling een , Pierc 'd through the thickest mail .</p>
    <p n="56">Kirkpatrick led her by the hand , With gay and courteous air : No stately castle in the land Could shew sae bright a pair .</p>
    <p n="57">O he was young — and clear the day Of life to youth appears ! Alas ! how soon his setting ray Was dimm 'd wi ’ showring tears !</p>
    <p n="58">Fell Lindsay sicken 'd at the sight , And sallow grew his cheek ; He tried wi ’ smiles to hide his spite , But word he cou'dna speak .</p>
    <p n="59">The gorgeous banquet was brought up , On silver and on gold : The page chose out a crystal cup , The sleepy juice to hold .</p>
    <p n="60">And whan Kirkpatrick call 'd for wine , This page the drink wou 'd bear ; Nor did the knight or dame divine Sic black deceit was near .</p>
    <p n="61">Then every lady sung a sang ; Some gay — some sad and sweet — Like tunefu ’ birds the woods amang , Till a ’ began to greet .</p>
    <p n="62">E'en cruel Lindsay shed a tear , Forletting malice deep — As mermaids , wi ’ their warbles clear , Can sing the waves to sleep .</p>
    <p n="63">And now to bed they all are dight , Now steek they ilka door : There 's nought but stillness o ’ the night , Whare was sic din before .</p>
    <p n="64">Fell Lindsay puts his harness on , His steed doth ready stand ; And up the stair-case is he gone , Wi ’ poniard in his hand .</p>
    <p n="65">The sweat did on his forehead break , He shook wi ’ guilty fear ; In air he heard a joyfu ’ shriek — Red Cumin 's ghaist was near .</p>
    <p n="66">Now to the chamber doth he creep — A lamp , of glimmering ray , Show 'd young Kirkpatrick fast asleep , In arms of lady gay .</p>
    <p n="67">He lay wi ’ bare unguarded breast , By sleepy juice beguil 'd ; And sometimes sigh 'd , by dreams opprest , And sometimes sweetly smiled .</p>
    <p n="68">Unclosed her mouth o ’ rosy hue , Whence issued fragrant air , That gently , in soft motion , blew Stray ringlets o ’ her hair .</p>
    <p n="69">“ Sleep on , sleep on , ye luvers dear ! “ The dame may wake to weep — “ But that day 's sun maun shine fou clear , “ That spills this warrior 's sleep . ”</p>
    <p n="70">He louted down — her lips he prest — O ! kiss , foreboding woe ! Then struck on young Kirkpatrick 's breast A deep and deadly blow .</p>
    <p n="71">Sair , sair , and mickle , did he bleed : His lady slept till day , But dream't the Firth<span type="note_anchor">[ 90 ]</span>flow 'd o'er her head , In bride-bed as she lay .</p>
    <p n="72">The murderer hasted down the stair , And back 'd his courser fleet : Than did the thunder ‘ gin to rair , Than show'rd the rain and sleet .</p>
    <p n="73">Ae fire-flaught darted through the rain , Whare a ’ was mirk before , And glinted o'er the raging main , That shook the sandy shore .</p>
    <p n="74">But mirk and mirker grew the night , And heavier beat the rain ; And quicker Lindsay urged his flight , Some ha ’ or beild to gain .</p>
    <p n="75">Lang did he ride o'er hill and dale , Nor mire nor flood he fear 'd : I trow his courage ‘ gan to fail When morning light appear 'd .</p>
    <p n="76">For having hied , the live-lang night , Through hail and heavy showers , He fand himsel , at peep o ’ light , Hard by Caerlaveroc 's towers .</p>
    <p n="77">The castle bell was ringing out , The ha ’ was all asteer ; And mony a scriech and waefu ’ shout Appall 'd the murderer 's ear .</p>
    <p n="78">Now they hae bound this traitor strang , Wi ’ curses and wi ’ blows ; And high in air they did him hang , To feed the carrion crows .</p>
    <p n="79">“ To sweet Lincluden 's<span type="note_anchor">[ 91 ]</span>haly cells “ Fou dowie I 'll repair ; “ There peace wi ’ gentle patience dwells , “ Nae deadly feuds are there . ”</p>
    <p n="80">“ In tears I 'll wither ilka charm , “ Like draps o ’ balefu ’ yew ; “ And wail the beauty that cou 'd harm “ A knight , sae brave and true . ”</p>

    <p n="88">BY M. G. LEWIS ESQ .— NOW FIRST PUBLISHED .</p>
    <p n="89">Oh ! gentle huntsman , softly tread , And softly wind thy bugle-horn ; Nor rudely break the silence shed Around the grave of Agilthorn !</p>
    <p n="90">Oh ! gentle huntsman , if a tear E'er dimmed for other 's woe thine eyes , Thoul't surely dew , with drops sincere , The sod , where Lady Eva lies .</p>
    <p n="91">Yon crumbling chapel 's sainted bound , Their hands and hearts beheld them plight , Long held yon towers , with ivy crowned , The beauteous dame and gallant knight .</p>
    <p n="92">Alas ! the hour of bliss is past , For hark ! the din of discord rings ; War 's clarion sounds , Joy hears the blast , And trembling plies his radiant wings .</p>
    <p n="93">And must sad Eva lose her lord ? And must he seek the martial plain ? Oh ! see , she brings his casque and sword ! Oh ! hark , she pours her plaintive strain !</p>
    <p n="94">“ Blest is the village damsel 's fate , “ Though poor and low her station be ; “ Safe from the cares which haunt the great , “ Safe from the cares which torture me !</p>
    <p n="95">“ No doubting fear , no cruel pain , “ No dread suspense her breast alarms ; “ No tyrant honour rules her swain , “ And tears him from her folding arms .</p>
    <p n="96">“ She , careless wandering ‘ midst the rocks , “ In pleasing toil consumes the day ; “ And tends her goats , or feeds her flocks , “ Or joins her rustic lover 's lay .</p>
    <p n="97">“ Though hard her couch , each sorrow flies “ The pillow which supports her head ; “ She sleeps , nor fears at morn her eyes “ Shall wake , to mourn an husband dead .</p>
    <p n="98">“ Hush , impious fears ! the good and brave “ Heaven 's arm will guard from danger free ; “ When Death with thousands gluts the grave , “ His dart , my love , shall glance from thee :</p>
    <p n="99">“ While thine shall fly direct and sure , “ This buckler every blow repell ; “ This casque from wounds that face secure , “ Where all the loves and graces dwell .</p>
    <p n="100">“ This glittering scarf , with tenderest care , “ My hands in happier moments wove ; “ Curst be the wretch , whose sword shall tear “ The spell-bound work of wedded love !</p>
    <p n="101">“ Lo ! on thy faulchion , keen and bright , “ I shed a trembling consort 's tears ; “ Oh ! when their traces meet thy sight , “ Remember wretched Eva 's fears !</p>
    <p n="102">“ Think , how thy lips she fondly prest ; “ Think , how she wept , compelled to part ; “ Think , every wound , which scars thy breast , “ Is doubly marked on Eva 's heart ! ”</p>
    <p n="103">“ O thou ! my mistress , wife , and friend ! ” Thus Agilthorn with sighs began ; “ Thy fond complaints my bosom rend , “ Thy tears my fainting soul unman :</p>
    <p n="104">“ In pity cease , my gentle dame , “ Such sweetness and such grief to join ! “ Lest I forget the voice of Fame , “ And only list to Love 's and thine .</p>
    <p n="105">“ Flow , flow , my tears ! unbounded gush ! “ Rise , rise , my sobs ! I set ye free ; “ Bleed , bleed , my heart ! I need not blush “ To own , that life is dear to me .</p>
    <p n="106">“ The wretch , whose lips have prest the bowl , “ The bitter bowl of pain and woe , “ May careless reach his mortal goal , “ May boldly meet the final blow :</p>
    <p n="107">“ His hopes destroyed , his comfort wreckt , An happier life he hopes to find ; But what can I in heaven expect , Beyond the bliss I leave behind ?</p>
    <p n="108">“ Oh , no ! the joys of yonder skies To prosperous love present no charms ; My heaven is placed in Eva 's eyes , My paradise in Eva 's arms .</p>
    <p n="109">“ Yet mark me , sweet ! if Heaven 's command Hath doomed my fall in martial strife , Oh ! let not anguish tempt thy hand To rashly break the thread of life !</p>
    <p n="110">“ No ! let our boy thy care engross , Let him thy stay , thy comfort , be ; Supply his luckless father 's loss , And love him for thyself and me .</p>
    <p n="111">“ So may oblivion soon efface The grief , which clouds this fatal morn ; And soon thy cheeks afford no trace Of tears , which fall for Agilthorn ! ”</p>
    <p n="112">He said , and couched his quivering lance ; He said , and braced his moony shield ; Sealed a last kiss , threw a last glance , Then spurred his steed to Flodden Field .</p>
    <p n="113">But Eva , of all joy bereft , Stood rooted at the castle gate , And viewed the prints his courser left , While hurrying at the call of fate .</p>
    <p n="114">Forebodings sad her bosom told , The steed , which bore him thence so light , Her longing eyes would ne'er behold Again bring home her own true knight .</p>
    <p n="115">While many a sigh her bosom heaves , She thus addrest her orphan page — “ Dear youth , if e'er my love relieved The sorrows of thy infant age ;</p>
    <p n="116">“ If e'er I taught thy locks to play , Luxuriant , round thy blooming face ; If e'er I wiped thy tears away , And bade them yield to smiles their place ;</p>
    <p n="117">“ Oh ! speed thee , swift as steed can bear , Where Flodden groans with heaps of dead , And , o'er the combat , home repair , And tell me how my lord has sped .</p>
    <p n="118">“ Till thou return'st , each hour 's an age , An age employed in doubt and pain ; Oh ! haste thee , haste , my little foot-page , Oh ! haste , and soon return again ! ”</p>
    <p n="119">“ Now , lady dear , thy grief assuage ! Good tidings soon shall ease thy pain : I 'll haste , I 'll haste , thy little foot-page , I 'll haste , and soon return again . ”</p>
    <p n="120">Then Oswy bade his courser fly ; But still , while hapless Eva wept , Time scarcely seemed his wings to ply , So slow the tedious moments crept .</p>
    <p n="121">And oft she kist her baby 's cheek , Who slumbered on her throbbing breast ; And now she bade the warder speak , And now she lulled her child to rest .</p>
    <p n="122">“ Good warder , say , what meets thy sight ? What see'st thou from the castle tower ? ” “ Nought but the rocks of Elginbright , Nought but the shades of Forest-Bower . ”</p>
    <p n="123">“ Oh ! pretty babe ! thy mother 's joy , Pledge of the purest , fondest flame , To-morrow 's sun , dear helpless boy ! Must see thee bear an orphan 's name .</p>
    <p n="124">“ Perhaps , e'en now , some Scottish sword The life-blood of thy father drains ; Perhaps , e'en now , that heart is gor 'd , Whose streams supplied thy little veins .</p>
    <p n="125">“ Oh ! warder , from the castle tower , Now say , what objects meet thy sight ? ” “ None but the shades of Forest-Bower , None but the rocks of Elginbright . ”</p>
    <p n="126">“ Smil'st thou , my babe ? so smiled thy sire , When gazing on his Eva 's face ; His eyes shot beams of gentle fire , And joy 'd such beams in mine to trace .</p>
    <p n="127">“ Sleep , sleep , my babe ! of care devoid ; Thy mother breathes this fervent vow — Oh ! never be thy soul employed On thoughts so sad , as her 's are now !</p>
    <p n="128">“ Now warder , warder , speak again ! What see'st thou from the turret 's height ? ” “ Oh ! lady , speeding o'er the plain , The little foot-page appears in sight . ”</p>
    <p n="129">Quick beat her heart ; short grew her breath ; Close to her breast the babe she drew — “ Now , Heaven , ” she cried , “ for life or death ! ” And forth to meet the page she flew .</p>
    <p n="130">“ And is thy lord from danger free ? And is the deadly combat o'er ? ” In silence Oswy bent his knee , And laid a scarf her feet before .</p>
    <p n="131">The well-known scarf with blood was stained , And tears from Oswy 's eye-lids fell ; Too truly Eva 's heart explained , What meant those silent tears to tell .</p>
    <p n="132">“ Come , come , my babe ! ” she wildly cried , “ We needs must seek the field of woe ; Come , come , my babe ! cast fear aside ! To dig thy father 's grave we go . ”</p>
    <p n="133">“ Stay , lady , stay ! a storm impends ; Lo ! threatening clouds the sky o'erspread ; The thunder roars , the rain descends , And lightning streaks the heavens with red .</p>
    <p n="134">“ Hark ! hark ! the winds tempestuous rave ! Oh ! be thy dread intent resigned ! Or , if resolved the storm to brave , Be this dear infant left behind ! ”</p>
    <p n="135">“ No ! no ! with me my baby stays ; With me he lives ; with me he dies ! Flash , lightnings , flash ! your friendly blaze Will shew me where my warrior lies . ”</p>
    <p n="136">O see she roams the bloody field , And wildly shrieks her husband 's name ; Oh ! see she stops and eyes a shield , An heart , the symbol , wrapt in flame .</p>
    <p n="137">His armour broke in many a place , A knight lay stretched that shield beside ; She raised his vizor , kist his face , Then on his bosom sunk , and died .</p>
    <p n="138">Huntsman , their rustic grave behold : ‘ Tis here , at night , the Fairy king , Where sleeps the fair , where sleeps the bold , Oft forms his light fantastic ring .</p>
    <p n="139">‘ Tis here , at eve , each village youth , With freshest flowers the turf adorns ; ‘ Tis here he swears eternal truth , By Eva 's faith and Agilthorn 's .</p>
    <p n="140">And here the virgins sadly tell , Each seated by her shepherd 's side , How brave the gallant warrior fell , How true his lovely lady died .</p>
    <p n="141">Ah ! gentle huntsman , pitying hear , And mourn the gentle lovers ’ doom ! Oh ! gentle huntsman , drop a tear , And dew the turf of Eva 's tomb !</p>
    <p n="142">So ne'er may fate thy hopes oppose ; So ne'er may grief to thee be known : They , who can weep for others ’ woes , Should ne'er have cause to weep their own .</p>

    <p n="159">NEVER BEFORE PUBLISHED — REV . DR JAMIESON .</p>
    <p n="160">The principal design of the author of this piece , was to give a specimen of Scottish writing , more nearly approaching to the classical compositions of our ancient bards , than that which has been generally followed for seventy or eighty years past . As the poem is descriptive of the superstitions of the vulgar , in the county of Angus , the scene is laid on the banks of South Esk , near the castle of Inverquharity , about five miles north from Forfar .</p>
    <p n="161">It is with pleasure that the editor announces to the literary world , that Dr Jamieson is about to publish a complete Dictionary of the Scottish Dialect ; his intimate acquaintance with which is evinced in the following stanzas .</p>
    <p n="162">WATER KELPIE .</p>
    <p n="163">Aft , owre the bent , with heather blent , And throw the forest brown , I tread the path to yon green strath , Quhare brae-born Esk rins down . Its banks alang , quhilk hazels thrang , Quhare sweet-sair 'd hawthorns blow , I lufe to stray , and view the play Of fleckit scales below .</p>
    <p n="164">Ae summer e'en , upon the green , I laid me down to gaze ; The place richt nigh , quhare Carity His humble tribute pays : And Prosen proud , with rippet loud , Cums ravin ’ frae his glen ; As gin he might auld Esk affricht , And drive him back agen .</p>
    <p n="165">An ancient tour appear't to lour Athort the neibourin plain , Quhais chieftain bauld , in times of auld , The kintre callit his ain . Its honours cowit , its now forhowit , And left the houlat 's prey ; Its skuggin ’ wude , aboon the flude , With gloom owrespreads the day .</p>
    <p n="166">A dreary shade the castle spread , And mirker grew the lift ; The croonin ’ kie the byre drew nigh , The darger left his thrift . The levrock shill on erd was still , The westlin wind fell loun ; The fisher 's houp forgat to loup , And aw for rest made boun .</p>
    <p n="167">I seemit to sloom , quhan throw the gloom I saw the river shake , And heard a whush alangis it rush , Gart aw my members quake ; Syne , in a stound , the pool profound To cleave in twain appear 'd : And huly throw the frichtsom how His form a gaist uprear 'd .</p>
    <p n="168">He rashes bare , and seggs , for hair , Quhare ramper-eels entwin 'd ; Of filthy gar his ee-brees war , With esks and horse-gells lin 'd . And for his een , with dowie sheen , Twa huge horse-mussels glar 'd : From his wide mow a torrent flew , And soupt his reedy beard .</p>
    <p n="169">Twa slauky stanes seemit his spule-banes ; His briskit braid , a whin ; Ilk rib sae bare , a skelvy skair ; Ilk arm a monstrous fin . He frae the wame a fish became , With shells aw coverit owre : And for his tail , the grislie whale Could nevir match its pow'r .</p>
    <p n="170">With dreddour I , quhen he drew nigh , Had maistly swarfit outricht : Less fleyit at lenth I gatherit strenth , And speirit quhat was this wicht . Syne thrice he shook his fearsum bouk , And thrice he snockerit loud ; From ilka ee the fire-flauchts flee , And flash alangis the flude .</p>

    <p n="191">And aw for rest made boun .— P . 385. v. 2 .</p>
    <p n="192">All commonly occurs in our old writers . But aw is here used , as corresponding with the general pronunciation in Scotland ; especially as it has the authority of Dunbar , in his Lament for the Deth of the Makaris .</p>
    <p n="193">His form a gaist uprear 'd .— P . 385. v. 8 .</p>
    <p n="194">It is believed in Angus , that the spirit of the waters appears sometimes as a man , with a very frightful aspect ; and , at other times , as a horse . The description , here given , must therefore be viewed as the offspring of fancy . All that can be said for it is , that such attributes are selected as are appropriate to the scenery .</p>
    <p n="195">Twa huge horse-mussells glar 'd .— P . 386. v. 1 .</p>
    <p n="196">South-Esk abounds with the fresh water oyster , vulgarly called the horse-mussel ; and , in former times , a pearl fishery was carried on here to considerable extent .</p>
    <p n="197">Frae yon deep glack , at Catla 's back .— P . 387. v. 1 .</p>
    <p n="198">Part of the Grampian mountains . Catla appears as a promontory , jutting out from the principal ridge , towards the plain . The Esk , if I recollect right , issues from behind it .</p>
    <p n="199">Thy mortal life to tyne .— P . 387. v. 2 .</p>
    <p n="200">The vulgar idea is , that a spirit , however frequently it appear , will not speak , unless previously addressed . It is , however , at the same time believed , that the person , who ventures to speak to a ghost , will soon forfeit his life , in consequence of his presumption .</p>
    <p n="201">His bridle frae my mow .— P . 388. v. 1 .</p>
    <p n="202">The popular tradition is here faithfully described ; and , strange to tell ! has not yet lost all credit . In the following verses , the principal articles of the vulgar creed in Angus , with respect to this supposed being , are brought together and illustrated by such facts as are yet appealed to by the credulous . If I mistake not , none of the historical circumstances mentioned are older than half a century . It is only about thirty years since the bridge referred to was built .</p>
    <p n="203">For sair-brizz 'd back and banes .— P . 388. v. 2 .</p>
    <p n="204">It is pretended that Kelpie celebrated this memorable event in rhyme ; and that for a long time after he was often heard to cry , with a doleful voice ,</p>
    <p n="205">“ Sair back and sair banes , Carryin ’ the laird of Murphy 's stanes . ”</p>
    <p n="206">And it thai Kelpie namit .— P . 388. v. 3 .</p>
    <p n="207">A head , like that of a gorgon , appears above the arch of the bridge . This was hewn in honour of Kelpie .</p>
    <p n="208">His shroud I had prepar 'd .— P . 390. v. 3 .</p>
    <p n="209">A very common tale in Scotland is here alluded to by the poet . On the banks of a rapid stream the water spirit was heard repeatedly to exclaim , in a dismal tone , “ The hour is come , but not the man ; ” when a person coming up , contrary to all remonstrances , endeavoured to ford the stream , and perished in the attempt . The original story is to be found in Gervase of Tilbury .— In the parish of Castleton , the same story is told , with this variation , that the by-standers prevented , by force , the predestined individual from entering the river , and shut him up in the church , where he was next morning found suffocated , with his face lying immersed in the baptismal font . To a fey person , therefore , Shakespeare 's words literally apply :</p>
    <p n="210">—— Put but a little water in a spoon , And it shall be as all the ocean , Enough to swallow such a being up .</p>

    <p n="362">ELLANDONAN CASTLE .</p>
    <p n="363">A HIGHLAND TALE .</p>
    <p n="364">NEVER BEFORE PUBLISHED .— -  COLIN MACKENZIE , ESQ .</p>
    <p n="365">Ellandonan Castle stands on a small rocky isle , situated in Loch Duich ( on the west coast of Ross ) , near the point where the western sea divides itself into two branches , forming Loch Duich and Loch Loung . The magnificence of the castle itself , now a roofless ruin , covered with ivy , the beauty of the bay , and the variety of hills and valleys that surround it , and particularly the fine range of hills , between which lie the pastures of Glensheal , with the lofty summit of Skooroora , overtopping the rest , and forming a grand back-ground to the picture ; all contribute to make this a piece of very romantic Highland scenery .<span type="note_anchor">[ 92 ]</span></p>
    <p n="366">The castle is the manor-place of the estate of Kintail , which is denominated the barony of Ellandonan . That estate is the property of Francis , Lord Seaforth . It has descended to him , through a long line of gallant ancestors ; having been originally conferred on Colin Fitzgerald , son to the Earl of Desmond and Kildare , in the kingdom of Ireland , by a charter , dated 9th January , 1266 , granted by King Alexander the third , “ Colino Hybernio , ” and bearing , as its inductive cause , “ pro bono et fideli servitio , tam in bello , quam in pace . ” He had performed a very recent service in war , having greatly distinguished himself in the battle of Largs , in 1263 , in which the invading army of Haco , King of Norway , was defeated . Being pursued in his flight , the king was overtaken in the narrow passage which divides the island of Skye from the coasts of Inverness and Ross , and , along with many of his followers , he himself was killed , in attempting his escape through the channel dividing Skye from Lochalsh . These straits , or kyles , bear to this day appellations , commemorating the events by which they were thus distinguished , the former being called Kyle Rhee , or the King 's Kyle , and the latter Kyle Haken .</p>
    <p n="367">The attack on Ellandonan Castle , which forms the subject of the following poem , lives in the tradition of the country , where it is , at this day , a familiar tale , repeated to every stranger , who , in sailing past , is struck with admiration at the sight of that venerable monument of antiquity . But the authenticity of the fact rests not solely on tradition . It is recorded , by Crawford , in his account of the family of Macdonald , Lord of the Isles , and reference is there made to a genealogy of Slate , in the possession of the family , as a warrant for the assertion . The incident took place in 1537 .</p>
    <p n="368">The power of the Lord of the Isles was at that time sufficiently great to give alarm to the crown . It covered not only the whole of the Western Isles , from Bute northwards , but also many extensive districts on the main-land , in the shires of Ayr , Argyle , and Inverness . Accordingly , in 1535 , on the failure of heirs-male of the body of John , Lord of the Isles , and Earl of Ross , as well as of two of his natural sons , in whose favour a particular substitution had been made , King James the fifth assumed the lordship of the Isles . The right was , however , claimed by Donald , fifth baron of Slate , descended from the immediate younger brother of John , Lord of the Isles . This bold and high-spirited chieftain lost his life in the attack on Ellandonan Castle , and was buried by his followers on the lands of Ardelve , on the opposite side of Loch Loung .</p>
    <p n="369">The barony of Ellandonan then belonged to John Mackenzie , ninth baron of Kintail . Kenneth , third baron , who was son to Kenneth , the son of Colin Fitzgerald , received the patronimic appellation of Mac Kenneth , or Mac Kennye , which descended from him to his posterity , as the sirname of the family . John , baron of Kintail , took a very active part in the general affairs of the kingdom . He fought gallantly at the battle of Flodden , under the banners of King James the fourth , was a member of the privy council in the reign of his son , and , at an advanced age , supported the standard of the unfortunate Mary , at the battle of Pinkie .</p>
    <p n="370">In the sixth generation from John , baron of Kintail , the clan was , by his lineal descendant , William , fifth earl of Seaforth , summoned , in 1715 , to take up arms in the cause of the house of Stuart . On the failure of that spirited , but ill-fated enterprize , the earl made his escape to the continent , where he lived for about eleven years . Meantime his estate and honours were forfeited to the crown , and his castle was burnt . A steward was appointed to levy the rents of Kintail , on the king 's behalf ; but the vassals spurned at his demands , and , while they carried on a successful defensive war , against a body of troops sent to subdue their obstinacy , in the course of which the unlucky steward had the misfortune to be slain , one of their number made a faithful collection of what was due , and carried the money to the earl himself , who was at that time in Spain . The descendants of the man , to whom it was entrusted to convey to his lord this unequivocal proof of the honour , fidelity , and attachment of his people , are at this day distinguished by the designation of Spaniard ; as Duncan , the Spaniard , &amp; c. The estate was , a few years after the forfeiture , purchased from government , for behoof of the family , and re-invested in the person of his son .</p>
    <p n="371">ELLANDONAN CASTLE .</p>
    <p n="372">A HIGHLAND TALE .</p>
    <p n="373">O wot ye , ye men of the island of Skye , That your lord lies a corpse on Ardelve 's rocky shore ? The Lord of the Isles , once so proud and so high , His lands and his vassals shall never see more .</p>
    <p n="374">None else but the Lord of Kintail was so great ; To that lord the green banks of Loch Duich belong , Ellandonan 's fair castle and noble estate , And the hills of Glensheal and the coasts of Loch Loung .</p>
    <p n="375">His vassals are many , and trusty , and brave , Descended from heroes , and worthy their sires ; His castle is wash 'd by the salt-water wave , And his bosom the ardour of valour inspires .</p>
    <p n="376">M'Donald , by restless ambition impell 'd To extend to the shores of Loch Duich his sway , With awe Ellandonan 's strong turrets beheld , And waited occasion to make them his prey .</p>
    <p n="377">And the moment was come ; for M'Kenneth , afar , To the Saxon opposed his victorious arm ; Few and old were the vassals , but dauntless in war , Whose courage and skill freed his towers from alarm .</p>
    <p n="378">M'Donald has chosen the best of his power ; On the green plains of Slate were his warriors arrayed ; Every Islander came before midnight an hour , With the sword in his hand , and the belt on his plaid .</p>
    <p n="379">The boats they are ready , in number a score ; In each boat twenty men , for the war of Kintail ; Iron hooks they all carry , to grapple the shore , And ladders , the walls of the fortress to scale .</p>
    <p n="380">They have pass 'd the strait kyle , thro ’ whose billowy flood , From the arms of Kintail-men , fled Haco of yore , Whose waves were dyed deep with Norwegian blood , Which was shed by M'Kenneth ' s resistless claymore .</p>
    <p n="381">They have enter 'd Loch Duich — all silent their course , Save the splash of the oar on the dark-bosom 'd wave , Which mingled with murmurs , low , hollow , and hoarse , That issued from many a coralline cave .</p>
    <p n="382">Either coast they avoid , and right eastward they steer ; Nor star , nor the moon , on their passage has shone ; Unexpecting assault , and unconscious of fear , All Kintail was asleep , save the watchman alone .</p>
    <p n="383">“ What , ho ! my companions ! arise , and behold “ Where Duich 's deep waters with flashes are bright ! “ Hark ! the sound of the oars ! rise , my friends , and be bold ! “ For some foe comes , perhaps , under shadow of night . ”</p>
    <p n="384">At the first of the dawn , when the boats reach 'd the shore , The sharp ridge of Skooroora with dark mist was crown 'd , And the rays , that broke thro ’ it , seem 'd spotted with gore , As M'Donald ' s bold currach first struck on the ground .</p>
    <p n="385">Of all the assailants , that sprung on the coast , One of stature and aspect superior was seen ; Whatever a lord or a chieftain could boast , Of valour undaunted , appear 'd in his mien .</p>
    <p n="386">His plaid o'er his shoulder was gracefully flung ; Its foldings a buckle of silver restrain 'd ; A massy broad sword on his manly thigh hung , Which defeat or disaster had never sustain 'd .</p>
    <p n="387">Then , under a bonnet of tartan and blue , Whose plumage was toss 'd to and fro by the gale , Their glances of lightning his eagle-eyes threw , Which were met by the frowns of the sons of Kintail .</p>
    <p n="388">‘ Twas the Lord of the Isles ; whom the chamberlain saw , While a trusty long bow on his bosom reclin 'd — Of stiff yew it was made , which few sinews could draw ; Its arrows flew straight , and as swift as the wind .</p>
    <p n="389">With a just aim he drew — the shaft pierced the bold chief : Indignant he started , nor heeding the smart , While his clan pour 'd around him , in clamorous grief , From the wound tore away the deep-rivetted dart .</p>
    <p n="390">The red stream flowed fast , and his cheek became white : His knees , with a tremor unknown to him , shook , And his once-piercing eyes scarce directed his sight , As he turn 'd towards Skye the last lingering look .</p>
    <p n="391">Surrounded by terror , disgrace , and defeat , From the rocks of Kintail the M'Donalds recoil 'd ; No order was seen in their hasty retreat , And their looks with dismay and confusion were wild .</p>
    <p n="392">While thine eyes wander oft from the green plains of Slate , In pursuit of thy lord , O M'Donald ' s fair dame , Ah ! little thou know'st ‘ tis the hour , mark 'd by Fate , To close his ambition , and tarnish his fame .</p>
    <p n="393">On the shore of Ardelve , far from home , is his grave , And the news of his death swiftly fly o'er the sea — Thy grief , O fair dame ! melts the hearts of the brave , Even the bard of Kintail wafts his pity to thee .</p>
    <p n="394">And thou , Ellandonan ! shall thy tow'rs ere again Be insulted by any adventurous foe , While the tale of the band , whom thy heroes have slain , Excites in their sons an inherited glow ?</p>
    <p n="395">Alas ! thou fair isle ! my soul 's darling and pride ! Too sure is the presage , that tells me thy doom , Tho ’ now thy proud towers all invasion deride , And thy fate lies far hid in futurity 's gloom .</p>
    <p n="396">A time shall arrive , after ages are past , When thy turrets , dismantled , in ruins shall fall , When , alas ! thro ’ thy chambers shall howl the sea-blast , And the thistle shall shake his red head in thy hall .</p>
    <p n="397">Shall this desolation strike thy towers alone ? No , fair Ellandonan ! such ruin ‘ twill bring , That the whirl shall have power to unsettle the throne , And thy fate shall be link 'd with the fate of thy king .</p>
    <p n="398">And great shall thy pride be , amid thy despair ; To their chief , and their prince , still thy sons shall be true ; The fruits of Kintail never victor shall share , Nor its vales ever gladden an enemy 's view .</p>
    <p n="399">And lovely thou shalt be , even after thy wreck ; Thy battlements never shall cease to be grand ; Their brown rusty hue the green ivy shall deck , And as long as Skooroora 's high top shall they stand .</p>

    <p n="402">CADYOW CASTLE .</p>
    <p n="403">BY THE EDITOR .</p>
    <p n="404">The ruins of Cadyow , or Cadzow Castle , the ancient baronial residence of the family of Hamilton , are situated upon the precipitous banks of the river Evan , about two miles above its junction with the Clyde . It was dismantled , in the conclusion of the civil wars , during the reign of the unfortunate Mary , to whose cause the house of Hamilton devoted themselves with a generous zeal , which occasioned their temporary obscurity , and , very nearly , their total ruin . The situation of the ruins , embosomed in wood , darkened by ivy and creeping shrubs , and overhanging the brawling torrent , is romantic in the highest degree . In the immediate vicinity of Cadyow is a grove of immense oaks , the remains of the Caledonian Forest , which anciently extended through the south of Scotland , from the eastern to the Atlantic Ocean . Some of these trees measure twenty-five feet , and upwards , in circumference ; and the state of decay , in which they now appear , shews , that they may have witnessed the rites of the Druids .— The whole scenery is included in the magnificent and extensive park of the Duke of Hamilton . There was long preserved in this forest the breed of the Scottish wild cattle , until their ferocity occasioned their being extirpated , about forty years ago . Their appearance was beautiful , being milk-white , with black muzzles , horns , and hoofs . The bulls are described by ancient authors , as having white manes ; but those of latter days had lost that peculiarity , perhaps by intermixture with the tame breed .<span type="note_anchor">[ 93 ]</span></p>
    <p n="405">In detailing the death of the regent Murray , which is made the subject of the following ballad , it would be injustice to my reader to use other words than those of Dr Robertson , whose account of that memorable event forms a beautiful piece of historical painting .</p>
    <p n="406">“ Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh was the person who committed this barbarous action . He had been condemned to death soon after the battle of Langside , as we have already related , and owed his life to the regent 's clemency . But part of his estate had been bestowed upon one of the regent 's favourites ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 94 ]</span>who seized his house , and turned out his wife , naked , in a cold night , into the open fields , where , before next morning , she became furiously mad . This injury made a deeper impression on him than the benefit he had received , and from that moment he vowed to be revenged of the regent . Party rage strengthened and inflamed his private resentment . His kinsmen , the Hamiltons , applauded the enterprize . The maxims of that age justified the most desperate course he could take to obtain vengeance . He followed the regent for some time , and watched for an opportunity to strike the blow . He resolved , at last , to wait till his enemy should arrive at Linlithgow , through which he was to pass , in his way from Stirling to Edinburgh . He took his stand in a wooden gallery ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 95 ]</span>which had a window towards the street ; spread a feather-bed on the floor , to hinder the noise of his feet from being heard ; hung up a black cloth behind him , that his shadow might not be observed from without ; and , after all this preparation , calmly expected the regent 's approach , who had lodged , during the night , in a house not far distant . Some indistinct information of the danger which threatened him had been conveyed to the regent , and he paid so much regard to it , that he resolved to return by the same gate through which he had entered , and to fetch a compass round the town . But , as the crowd about the gate was great , and he himself unacquainted with fear , he proceeded directly along the street ; and the throng of people obliging him to move very slowly , gave the assassin time to take so true an aim , that he shot him , with a single bullet , through the lower part of his belly , and killed the horse of a gentleman , who rode on his other side . His followers instantly endeavoured to break into the house , whence the blow had come ; but they found the door strongly barricaded , and , before it could be forced open , Hamilton had mounted a fleet horse ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 96 ]</span>which stood ready for him at a back-passage , and was got far beyond their reach . The regent died the same night of his wound . ” — History of Scotland , book v .</p>
    <p n="407">Bothwellhaugh rode straight to Hamilton , where he was received in triumph ; for the ashes of the houses in Clydesdale , which had been burned by Murray 's army , were yet smoking ; and party prejudice , the habits of the age , and the enormity of the provocation , seemed , to his kinsmen , to justify his deed . After a short abode at Hamilton , this fierce and determined man left Scotland , and served in France , under the patronage of the family of Guise , to whom he was doubtless recommended by having avenged the cause of their niece , Queen Mary , upon her ungrateful brother . De Thou has recorded , that an attempt was made to engage him to assassinate Gaspar de Coligni , the famous admiral of France , and the buckler of the Huguenot cause . But the character of Bothwellhaugh was mistaken . He was no mercenary trader in blood , and rejected the offer with contempt and indignation . He had no authority , he said , from Scotland , to commit murders in France ; he had avenged his own just quarrel , but he would neither , for price nor prayer , avenge that of another man .— Thaunus , cap . 46 .</p>
    <p n="408">The regent 's death happened 23d January , 1569 . It is applauded or stigmatized , by contemporary historians , according to their religious or party prejudices . The triumph of Blackwood is unbounded . He not only extols the pious feat of Bothwellhaugh , “ who , ” he observes , “ satisfied , with a single ounce of lead , him , whose sacrilegious avarice had stripped the metropolitan church of St Andrew 's of its covering ; ” but he ascribes it to immediate divine inspiration , and the escape of Hamilton to little less than the miraculous interference of the Deity .— Jebb , Vol . II . p. 263 . With equal injustice , it was , by others , made the ground of a general national reflection ; for , when Mather urged Berney to assassinate Burleigh , and quoted the examples of Poltrot and Bothwellhaugh , the other conspirator answered , “ that neyther Poltrot nor Hambleton did attempt their enterpryse , without some reason or consideration to lead them to it ; as the one , by hyre , and promise of preferment or rewarde ; the other , upon desperate mind of revenge , for a lytle wrong done unto him , as the report goethe , accordinge to the vyle trayterous dysposysyon of the hoole natyon of the Scottes . ” — Murdin 's State Papers , Vol . I. p. 197 .</p>
    <p n="409">CADYOW CASTLE .</p>
    <p n="410">ADDRESSED TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE LADY ANNE HAMILTON .</p>
    <p n="411">When princely Hamilton 's abode Ennobled Cadyow 's Gothic towers , The song went round , the goblet flowed , And revel sped the laughing hours .</p>
    <p n="412">Then , thrilling to the harp 's gay sound , So sweetly rung each vaulted wall , And echoed light the dancer 's bound , As mirth and music cheer 'd the hall .</p>
    <p n="413">But Cadyow 's towers , in ruins laid , And vaults , by ivy mantled o'er , Thrill to the music of the shade , Or echo Evan 's hoarser roar .</p>
    <p n="414">Yet still , of Cadyow 's faded fame , You bid me tell a minstrel tale , And tune my harp , of Border frame , On the wild banks of Evandale .</p>
    <p n="415">For thou , from scenes of courtly pride , From pleasure 's lighter scenes , canst turn , To draw oblivion 's pall aside , And mark the long forgotten urn .</p>
    <p n="416">Then , noble maid ! at thy command , Again the crumbled halls shall rise ; Lo ! as on Evan 's banks we stand , The past returns — the present flies .—</p>
    <p n="417">Where with the rock 's wood-cover 'd side Were blended late the ruins green , Rise turrets in fantastic pride , And feudal banners flaunt between :</p>
    <p n="418">Where the rude torrent 's brawling course Was shagg 'd with thorn and tangling sloe , The ashler buttress braves its force , And ramparts frown in battled row .</p>
    <p n="419">‘ Tis night — the shade of keep and spire Obscurely dance on Evan 's stream , And on the wave the warder 's fire Is chequering the moon-light beam .</p>
    <p n="420">Fades slow their light ; the east is grey ; The weary warder leaves his tower ; Steeds snort ; uncoupled stag-hounds bay , And merry hunters quit the bower .</p>
    <p n="421">The draw-bridge falls — they hurry out — Clatters each plank and swinging chain , As , dashing o'er , the jovial route Urge the shy steed , and slack the rein .</p>
    <p n="422">First of his troop , the chief rode on ; His shouting merry-men throng behind ; The steed of princely Hamilton Was fleeter than the mountain wind .</p>
    <p n="423">From the thick copse the roe-bucks bound , The startling red-deer scuds the plain , For the hoarse bugle 's warrior sound Has rouzed their mountain haunts again .</p>
    <p n="424">Through the huge oaks of Evandale , Whose limbs a thousand years have worn , What sullen roar comes down the gale , And drowns the hunter 's pealing horn ?</p>
    <p n="425">Mightiest of all the beasts of chace , That roam in woody Caledon , Crashing the forest in his race , The Mountain Bull comes thundering on .</p>
    <p n="426">Fierce , on the hunters ’ quiver 'd band , He rolls his eyes of swarthy glow , Spurns , with black hoof and horn , the sand , And tosses high his mane of snow .</p>
    <p n="427">Aim 'd well , the chieftain 's lance has flown ; Struggling , in blood the savage lies ; His roar is sunk in hollow groan — Sound , merry huntsmen ! sound the pryse !<span type="note_anchor">[ 97 ]</span></p>
    <p n="428">‘ Tis noon — against the knotted oak The hunters rest the idle spear ; Curls through the trees the slender smoke , Where yeomen dight the woodland cheer .</p>
    <p n="429">Proudly the chieftain mark 'd his clan , On greenwood lap all careless thrown , Yet miss 'd his eye the boldest man , That bore the name of Hamilton .</p>
    <p n="430">“ Why fills not Bothwellhaugh his place , “ Still wont our weal and woe to share ? “ Why comes he not our sport to grace ? “ Why shares he not our hunter 's fare ? ”</p>
    <p n="431">Stern Claud replied , with darkening face , ( Grey Pasley 's haughty lord was he ) “ At merry feast , or buxom chace , “ No more the warrior shalt thou see .</p>
    <p n="432">“ Few suns have set , since Woodhouselee “ Saw Bothwellhaugh 's bright goblets foam , “ When to his hearths , in social glee , “ The war-worn soldier turn 'd him home .</p>
    <p n="433">“ There , wan from her maternal throes , “ His Margaret , beautiful and mild , “ Sate in her bower , a pallid rose , “ And peaceful nursed her new-born child .</p>
    <p n="434">“ O change accurs 'd ! past are those days ; “ False Murray 's ruthless spoilers came , “ And , for the hearth 's domestic blaze , “ Ascends destruction 's volumed flame .</p>
    <p n="435">“ What sheeted phantom wanders wild , “ Where mountain Eske through woodland flows , “ Her arms enfold a shadowy child — “ Oh is it she , the pallid rose ?</p>
    <p n="436">“ The wildered traveller sees her glide , “ And hears her feeble voice with awe — ‘ Revenge , ’ she cries , ‘ on Murray 's pride ! ‘ And woe for injured Bothwellhaugh ! ’</p>
    <p n="437">He ceased — and cries of rage and grief Burst mingling from the kindred band , And half arose the kindling chief , And half unsheath 'd his Arran brand .</p>
    <p n="438">But who , o'er bush , o'er stream and rock , Rides headlong , with resistless speed , Whose bloody poniard 's frantic stroke Drives to the leap his jaded steed ;</p>
    <p n="439">Whose cheek is pale , whose eye-balls glare , As one , some visioned sight that saw , Whose hands are bloody , loose his hair ?— — ‘ Tis he ! ‘ tis he ! ‘ tis Bothwellhaugh .</p>
    <p n="440">From gory selle ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 98 ]</span>and reeling steed , Sprung the fierce horseman with a bound , And , reeking from the recent deed , He dashed his carbine on the ground .</p>
    <p n="441">Sternly he spoke — “ ‘ Tis sweet to hear In good greenwood the bugle blown , But sweeter to Revenge 's ear , To drink a tyrant 's dying groan .</p>
    <p n="442">“ Your slaughtered quarry proudly trod , At dawning morn , o'er dale and down , But prouder base-born Murray rode Thro ’ old Linlithgow 's crowded town .</p>
    <p n="443">“ From the wild Border 's humbled side , “ In haughty triumph , marched he , “ While Knox relaxed his bigot pride , “ And smiled , the traitorous pomp to see .</p>
    <p n="444">“ But , can stern Power , with all his vaunt , “ Or Pomp , with all her courtly glare , “ The settled heart of Vengeance daunt , “ Or change the purpose of Despair ?</p>

    <p n="447">“ Glencairn and stout Parkhead were nigh , “ Obsequious at their regent 's rein , “ And haggard Lindesay 's iron eye , “ That saw fair Mary weep in vain .</p>
    <p n="448">“ Mid pennon 'd spears , a steely grove , “ Proud Murray 's plumage floated high ; “ Scarce could his trampling charger move , “ So close the minions crowded nigh .</p>
    <p n="449">“ From the raised vizor 's shade , his eye , “ Dark-rolling , glanced the ranks along , “ And his steel truncheon , waved on high , “ Seem 'd marshalling the iron throng .</p>
    <p n="450">“ But yet his sadden 'd brow confess 'd “ A passing shade of doubt and awe ; “ Some fiend was whispering in his breast , ‘ Beware of injured Bothwellhaugh ! ’</p>
    <p n="451">“ The death-shot parts — the charger springs — “ Wild rises tumult 's startling roar !— “ And Murray 's plumy helmet rings — “ — Rings on the ground , to rise no more .</p>
    <p n="452">“ What joy the raptured youth can feel , “ To hear her love the loved one tell , “ Or he , who broaches on his steel “ The wolf , by whom his infant fell !</p>
    <p n="453">“ But dearer , to my injured eye , “ To see in dust proud Murray roll ; “ And mine was ten times trebled joy , “ To hear him groan his felon soul .</p>
    <p n="454">“ My Margaret 's spectre glided near ; “ With pride her bleeding victim saw ; “ And shrieked in his death-deafen 'd ear , ‘ Remember injured Bothwellhaugh ! ’</p>
    <p n="455">“ Then speed thee , noble Chatlerault ! “ Spread to the wind thy bannered tree ! “ Each warrior bend his Clydesdale bow !— “ Murray is fallen , and Scotland free . ”</p>
    <p n="456">Vaults every warrior to his steed ; Loud bugles join their wild acclaim — “ Murray is fallen , and Scotland freed ! “ Couch , Arran ! couch thy spear of flame ! ”</p>
    <p n="457">But , see ! the minstrel vision fails — The glimmering spears are seen no more ; The shouts of war die on the gales , Or sink in Evan 's lonely roar .</p>
    <p n="458">For the loud bugle , pealing high , The blackbird whistles down the vale , And sunk in ivied ruins lie The banner 'd towers of Evandale .</p>
    <p n="459">For chiefs , intent on bloody deed , And Vengeance , shouting o'er the slain , Lo ! high-born Beauty rules the steed , Or graceful guides the silken rein .</p>
    <p n="460">And long may Peace and Pleasure own The maids , who list the minstrel 's tale ; Nor e'er a ruder guest be known On the fair banks of Evandale !</p>

    <p n="462">The head of the family of Hamilton , at this period , was James , Earl of Arran , Duke of Chatelherault , in France , and first peer of the Scottish realm . In 1569 , he was appointed by Queen Mary her lieutenant-general in Scotland , under the singular title of her adopted father .</p>

    <p n="465">Stern Claud replied , with darkening face , ( Grey Pasley 's haughty lord was he ) .— P . 420. v. 4 .</p>
    <p n="466">Lord Claud Hamilton , second son of the Duke of Chatelherault , and commendator of the abbey of Paisley , acted a distinguished part during the troubles of Queen Mary 's reign , and remained unalterably attached to the cause of that unfortunate princess . He led the van of her army at the fatal battle of Langside , and was one of the commanders at the Raid of Stirling , which had so nearly given complete success to the queen 's faction . He was ancestor of the present Marquis of Abercorn .</p>
    <p n="467">Few suns have set since Woodhouselee .— P . 420. v. 5 .</p>
    <p n="468">This barony , stretching along the banks of the Esk , near Auchindinny , belonged to Bothwellhaugh , in right of his wife . The ruins of the mansion , from whence she was expelled in the brutal manner which occasioned her death , are still to be seen in a hollow glen beside the river . Popular report tenants them with the restless ghost of the lady Bothwellhaugh ; whom , however , it confounds with Lady Anne Bothwell , whose Lament is so popular . This spectre is so tenacious of her rights , that , a part of the stones of the ancient edifice having been employed in building or repairing the present Woodhouselee , she has deemed it a part of her privilege to haunt that house also ; and , even of very late years , has excited considerable disturbance and terror among the domestics . This is a more remarkable vindication of the rights of ghosts , as the present Woodhouselee , which gives his title to the honourable Alexander Fraser Tytler , a senator of the college of justice , is situated on the slope of the Pentland hills , distant at least four miles from her proper abode . She always appears in white , and with her child in her arms .</p>

    <p n="470">Birrell informs us , that Bothwellhaugh , being closely pursued , “ after that spur and wand had fail 'd him , he drew forth his dagger , and strocke his horse behind , whilk caused the horse to leap a verey brode stanke ( i. e . ditch ) , by whilk means he escaipit , and gat away from all the rest of the horses . ” — BIRREL 'S Diary , p. 18 .</p>

    <p n="472">Murray 's death took place shortly after an expedition to the borders ; which is thus commemorated by the author of his elegy :</p>
    <p n="473">“ So having stablischt all thing in this sort , “ To Liddisdaill agane he did resort , “ Throw Ewisdail , Eskdail , and all the daills rode he , “ And also lay three nights in Cannabie , “ Whair na prince lay thir hundred yeiris before . “ Nae thief durst stir , they did him feir so sair ; “ And , that thay suld na mair thair thift allege , “ Threescore and twelf he brocht of thame in pledge , “ Syne wardit thame , whilk maid the rest keep ordour , “ Than mycht the rasch-bus keep ky on the bordour . ”</p>

    <p n="476">The carbine , with which the regent was shot , is preserved at Hamilton palace . It is a brass piece , of a middling length , very small in the bore , and , what is rather extraordinary , appears to have been rifled or indented in the barrel .

    <p n="479">The wild Macfarlanes ’ plaided clan .— P . 423. v. 4 .</p>
    <p n="480">This clan of Lennox Highlanders were attached to the regent Murray . Holinshed , speaking of the battle of Langsyde , says , “ in this batayle the valiancie of an hieland gentleman , named Macfarlane , stood the regent 's part in great steede ; for , in the hottest brunte of the fighte , he came up with two hundred of his friendes and countrymen , and so manfully gave in upon the flankes of the queen 's people , that he was a great cause of the disordering of them . This Macfarlane had been lately before , as I have heard , condemned to die , for some outrage by him committed , and obtayning pardon through suyte of the Countesse of Murray , he recompenced that clemencie by this piece of service now at this batayle . ” Calderwood 's account is less favourable to the Macfarlanes . He states that “ Macfarlane , with his highlandmen , fled from the wing where they were set . The Lord Lindsay , who stood nearest to them in the regent 's battle , said ‘ Let them go ! I shall fill their place better : ’ and so , stepping forward , with a company of fresh men , charged the enemy , whose spears were now spent , with long weapons , so that they were driven back by force , being before almost overthrown by the avaunt-guard and harquebusiers , and so were turned to flight . ” — CALDERWOOD 'S MS. apud KEITH , p. 480 . Melville mentions the flight of the vanguard , but states it to have been commanded by Morton , and composed chiefly of commoners of the barony of Renfrew .</p>

    <p n="495">THE GRAY BROTHER ,</p>
    <p n="496">A FRAGMENT .</p>
    <p n="497">NEVER BEFORE PUBLISHED .— WALTER SCOTT .</p>
    <p n="498">The imperfect state of this ballad , which was written several years ago , is not a circumstance affected for the purpose of giving it that peculiar interest , which is often found to arise from ungratified curiosity . On the contrary , it was the editor 's intention to have completed the tale , if he had found himself able to succeed to his own satisfaction . Yielding to the opinion of persons , whose judgment , if not biassed by the partiality of friendship , is entitled to deference , the editor has preferred inserting these verses , as a fragment , to his intention of entirely suppressing them .</p>
    <p n="499">The tradition , upon which the tale is founded , regards a house , upon the barony of Gilmerton , near Laswade , in Mid-Lothian . This building , now called Gilmerton Grange , was originally named Burndale , from the following tragic adventure . The barony of Gilmerton belonged , of yore , to a gentleman , named Heron , who had one beautiful daughter . This young lady was seduced by the abbot of Newbottle , a richly endowed abbey , upon the banks of the south Esk , now a seat of the marquis of Lothian . Heron came to the knowledge of this circumstance , and learned also , that the lovers carried on their guilty intercourse by the connivance of the lady 's nurse , who lived at this house of Gilmerton Grange , or Burndale . He formed a resolution of bloody vengeance , undeterred by the supposed sanctity of the clerical character , or by the stronger claims of natural affection . Chusing , therefore , a dark and windy night , when the objects of his vengeance were engaged in a stolen interview , he set fire to a stack of dried thorns , and other combustibles , which he had caused to be piled against the house , and reduced to a pile of glowing ashes the dwelling , with all its inmates .<span type="note_anchor">[ 100 ]</span></p>
    <p n="500">The scene , with which the ballad opens , was suggested by the following curious passage , extracted from the life of Alexander Peden , one of the wandering and persecuted teachers of the sect of Cameronians , during the reign of Charles II . and his successor , James . This person was supposed by his followers , and , perhaps , really believed himself , to be possessed of supernatural gifts ; for the wild scenes , which they frequented , and the constant dangers , which were incurred through their proscription , deepened upon their minds the gloom of superstition , so general in that age .</p>
    <p n="501">“ About the same time he ( Peden ) came to Andrew Normand 's house , in the parish of Alloway , in the shire of Ayr , being to preach at night in his barn . After he came in , he halted a little , leaning upon a chair-back , with his face covered ; when he lifted up his head , he said , ‘ There are in this house that I have not one word of salvation unto ; ’ he halted a little again , saying , ‘ This is strange , that the devil will not go out , that we may begin our work ! ’ Then there was a woman went out , ill-looked upon almost all her life , and to her dying hour , for a witch , with many presumptions of the same . It escaped me , in the former passages , that John Muirhead ( whom I have often mentioned ) told me , that when he came from Ireland to Galloway , he was at family-worship , and giving some notes upon the Scripture , when a very ill-looking man came , and sate down within the door , at the back of the hallan ( partition of the cottage ): immediately he halted , and said , ‘ There is some unhappy body just now come into this house . I charge him to go out , and not stop my mouth ! ’ The person went out , and he insisted ( went on ) , yet he saw him neither come in nor go out . ” — The Life and Prophecies of Mr Alexander Peden , late Minister of the Gospel at New Glenluce , in Galloway , Part II . Sec . 26 .</p>
    <p n="502">THE GRAY BROTHER .</p>
    <p n="503">The Pope he was saying the high , high mass , All on saint Peter 's day , With the power to him given , by the saints in heaven , To wash men 's sins away .</p>
    <p n="504">The pope he was saying the blessed mass , And the people kneel 'd around , And from each man 's soul his sins did pass , As he kiss 'd the holy ground .</p>
    <p n="505">And all , among the crowded throng , Was still , both limb and tongue , While thro ’ vaulted roof , and aisles aloof , The holy accents rung .</p>
    <p n="506">At the holiest word , he quiver 'd for fear , And faulter 'd in the sound — And , when he would the chalice rear , He dropp 'd it on the ground .</p>
    <p n="507">“ The breath of one of evil deed “ Pollutes our sacred day ; “ He has no portion in our creed , “ No part in what I say .</p>
    <p n="508">“ A being , whom no blessed word “ To ghostly peace can bring ; “ A wretch , at whose approach abhorr 'd , “ Recoils each holy thing .</p>
    <p n="509">“ Up ! up ! unhappy ! haste , arise ! “ My adjuration fear ! “ I charge thee not to stop my voice , “ Nor longer tarry here ! ”</p>
    <p n="510">Amid them all a pilgrim kneel 'd , In gown of sackcloth gray ; Far journeying from his native field , He first saw Rome that day .</p>
    <p n="511">For forty days and nights , so drear , I ween , he had not spoke , And , save with bread and water clear , His fast he ne'er had broke .</p>
    <p n="512">Amid the penitential flock , Seem 'd none more bent to pray ; But , when the Holy Father spoke , He rose , and went his way .</p>
    <p n="513">Again unto his native land , His weary course he drew , To Lothian 's fair and fertile strand , And Pentland 's mountains blue .</p>
    <p n="514">His unblest feet his native seat , Mid Eske 's fair woods , regain ; Thro ’ woods more fair no stream more sweet Rolls to the eastern main .</p>
    <p n="515">And lords to meet the Pilgrim came , And vassals bent the knee ; For all mid Scotland 's chiefs of fame , Was none more famed than he .</p>
    <p n="516">And boldly for his country , still , In battle he had stood , Aye , even when , on the banks of Till , Her noblest pour 'd their blood .</p>
    <p n="517">Sweet are the paths , O passing sweet ! By Eske 's fair streams that run , O'er airy steep , thro ’ copsewood deep , Impervious to the sun .</p>
    <p n="518">There the rapt poet 's step may rove , And yield the muse the day ; There Beauty , led by timid Love , May shun the tell-tale ray ;</p>
    <p n="519">From that fair dome , where suit is paid , By blast of bugle free , To Auchendinny 's hazel glade , And haunted Woodhouselee .</p>
    <p n="520">Who knows not Melville 's beechy grove , And Roslin 's rocky glen , Dalkeith , which all the virtues love , And classic Hawthornden ?</p>
    <p n="521">Yet never a path , from day to day , The pilgrim 's footsteps range , Save but the solitary way To Burndale 's ruin 'd Grange .</p>
    <p n="522">A woeful place was that , I ween , As sorrow could desire ; For , nodding to the fall was each crumbling wall , And the roof was scathed with fire .</p>
    <p n="523">It fell upon a summer 's eve , While on Carnethy 's head , The last faint gleams of the sun 's low beams Had streak 'd the gray with red ;</p>
    <p n="524">And the convent-bell did vespers tell , Newbottle 's oaks among , And mingled with the solemn knell Our Ladye 's evening song :</p>
    <p n="525">The heavy knell , the choir 's faint swell , Came slowly down the wind , And on the pilgrim 's ear they fell , As his wonted path he did find .</p>
    <p n="526">Deep sunk in thought , I ween , he was , Nor ever rais 'd his eye , Untill he came to that dreary place , Which did all in ruins lie .</p>
    <p n="527">He gazed on the walls , so scathed with fire , With many a bitter groan — And there was aware of a Gray Friar , Resting him on a stone .</p>
    <p n="528">“ Now , Christ thee save ! ” said the Gray Brother ; “ Some pilgrim thou seemest to be . ” But in sore amaze did Lord Albert gaze , Nor answer again made he .</p>
    <p n="529">“ O come ye from east , or come ye from west , “ Or bring reliques from over the sea , “ Or come ye from the shrine of St James the divine , “ Or St John of Beverly ? ”</p>
    <p n="530">“ I come not from the shrine of St James the divine , “ Nor bring reliques from over the sea ; “ I bring but a curse from our father , the Pope , “ Which for ever will cling to me . ”</p>
    <p n="531">“ Now , woeful pilgrim , say not so ! “ But kneel thee down by me , “ And shrive thee so clean of thy deadly sin , “ That absolved thou mayst be . ”</p>
    <p n="532">“ And who art thou , thou Gray Brother , “ That I should shrive to thee , “ When he , to whom are giv'n the keys of earth and heav'n , “ Has no power to pardon me ? ”</p>
    <p n="533">“ O I am sent from a distant clime , “ Five thousand miles away , “ And all to absolve a foul , foul crime , “ Done here ‘ twixt night and day . ”</p>
    <p n="534">The pilgrim kneel 'd him on the sand , And thus began his saye — When on his neck an ice-cold hand Did that Gray Brother laye .</p>

Had we a difference with some petty isle , Or with our neighbours , Britons , for our landmarks , The taking in of some rebellious lord , Or making head against a slight commotion , After a day of blood , peace might be argued : But where we grapple for the land we live on , The liberty we hold more dear than life , The gods we worship , and , next these , our honours , And , with those , swords , that know no end of battle — Those men , beside themselves , allow no neighbour , Those minds , that , where the day is , claim inheritance , And , where the sun makes ripe the fruit , their harvest , And , where they march , but measure out more ground To add to Rome —— It must not be .— No ! as they are our foes , Let 's use the peace of honour — that 's fair dealing ; But in our hands our swords .

    <p n="559">The following War-Song was written during the apprehension of an invasion . The corps of volunteers , to which it was addressed , was raised in 1797 , consisting of gentlemen , mounted and armed at their own expence . It still subsists , as the Right Troop of the Royal Mid-Lothian Light Cavalry , commanded by the Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Dundas . The noble and constitutional measure of arming freemen in defence of their own rights , was no where more successful than in Edinburgh , which furnished a force of 3000 armed and disciplined volunteers , including a Regiment of Cavalry , from the city and county , and two Corps of Artillery , each capable of serving twelve guns . To such a force , above all others , might , in similar circumstances , be applied the exhortation of our ancient Galgacus : “ Proinde ituri in aciem , et majores vestros et posteros cogitate . ”</p>

    <p n="573">The allusion is to the massacre of the Swiss guards , on the fatal 10th August , 1792 . It is painful , but not useless , to remark , that the passive temper with which the Swiss regarded the death of their bravest countrymen , mercilessly slaughtered in discharge of their duty , encouraged and authorized the progressive injustice , by which the Alps , once the seat of the most virtuous and free people upon the continent , have , at length , been converted into the citadel of a foreign and military despot .

    <p n="618">BY THE REV . JOHN MARRIOTT , A. M .</p>
    <p n="619">As Archie passed the Brockwood-leys , He cursed the blinkan moon , For shouts were borne upo ’ the breeze Frae a ’ the hills aboon .</p>
    <p n="620">A herd had marked his lingering pace That e'enin near the fauld , And warned his fellows to the chace , For he kenn 'd him stout and bauld .</p>
    <p n="621">A light shone frae Gilnockie tower ; He thought , as he ran past ,— “ O Johnie ance was stiff in stour , “ But hangit at the last ! ” —</p>
    <p n="622">His load was heavy , and the way Was rough , and ill to find ; But ere he reached the Stubholm brae , His faes were far behind .</p>
    <p n="623">He clamb the brae , and frae his brow The draps fell fast and free ; And when he heard a loud halloo , A waefu ’ man was he .</p>
    <p n="624">O'er his left shouther , towards the muir , An anxious e'e he cast ; And oh ! when he stepped o'er the door , His wife she looked aghast .</p>
    <p n="625">“ Ah wherefore , Archie , wad ye slight “ Ilk word o ’ timely warning ? “ I trow ye will be ta'en the night , “ And hangit i ’ the morning . ” —</p>
    <p n="626">“ Now haud your tongue , ye prating wife , “ And help me as ye dow ; “ I wad be laith to lose my life “ For ae poor silly yowe . ” —</p>
    <p n="627">They stript awa the skin aff-hand , Wi ’ a ’ the woo ’ aboon ; There 's ne'er a flesher<span type="note_anchor">[ 107 ]</span>i ’ the land Had done it half sae soon .</p>
    <p n="628">They took the haggis-bag and heart , The heart , but and the liver ; Alake , that siccan a noble part Should win intull the river !</p>
    <p n="629">But Archie he has ta'en them a ’ , And wrapt them i ’ the skin ; And he has thrown them o'er the wa ’ , And sicht whan they fell in .</p>
    <p n="630">The cradle stans by the ingle<span type="note_anchor">[ 108 ]</span>toom ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 109 ]</span>The bairn wi ’ auntie stays ; They clapt the carcase in its room , And smoored it wi ’ the claes .</p>
    <p n="631">And down sate Archie daintilie , And rocked it wi ’ his hand ; Siccan a rough nourice as he Was not in a ’ the land .</p>
    <p n="632">And saftlie he began to croon ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 110 ]</span>“ Hush , hushabye , my dear . ” — He had na sang to sic a tune , I trow , for monie a year .</p>
    <p n="633">Now frae the hills they cam in haste , A ’ rinning out o ’ breath ;— “ Ah , Archie , we ha ’ got ye fast , “ And ye maun die the death !</p>
    <p n="634">“ Aft ha ’ ye thinned our master 's herds , “ And elsewhere cast the blame ; “ Now ye may spare your wilie words , “ For we have traced ye hame . ” —</p>
    <p n="635">“ Your sheep for warlds I wad na take ; “ Deil ha ’ me if I 'm lying ; “ But haud your tongues for mercie 's sake , “ The bairn 's just at the dying .</p>
    <p n="636">“ If e'er I did sae fause a feat , “ As thin my neebor 's faulds , “ May I be doomed the flesh to eat “ This vera cradle halds !</p>
    <p n="637">“ But gin ye reck na what I swear , “ Go search the biggin<span type="note_anchor">[ 111 ]</span>thorow , “ And if ye find ae trotter there , “ Then hang me up the morrow . ” —</p>
    <p n="638">They thought to find the stolen gear , They searched baith but and ben ; But a ’ was clean , and a ’ was clear , And naething could they ken .</p>
    <p n="639">And what to think they could na tell , They glowred at ane anither ;— “ Sure , Patie , ‘ twas the deil himsel “ That ye saw rinning hither .</p>
    <p n="640">“ Or aiblins Maggie 's ta'en the yowe , “ And thus beguiled your e'e . ” — “ Hey , Robie , man , and like enowe , “ For I ha'e nae rowan-tree . ” —</p>
    <p n="641">Awa ’ they went wi ’ muckle haste , Convinced ‘ twas Maggie Brown ; And Maggie , ere eight days were past , Got mair nor ae new gown .</p>
    <p n="642">Then Archie turned him on his heel , And gamesomelie did say ,— “ I did na think that half sae weel “ The nourice I could play . ”</p>
    <p n="643">And Archie didna break his aith , He ate the cradled sheep ; I trow he was na vera laith Siccan a vow to keep .</p>
    <p n="644">And aft sinsyne to England 's king The story he has told ; And aye when he gan rock and sing , Charlie his sides wad hold .</p>
    <p n="645">NOTES ON ARCHIE ARMSTRONG 'S AITH .</p>
    <p n="646">The hero of this ballad was a native of Eskdale , and contributed not a little towards the raising his clan to that pre-eminence which it long maintained amongst the Border thieves , and which none indeed but the Elliots could dispute . He lived at the Stubholm , immediately below the junction of the Wauchope and the Esk ; and there distinguished himself so much by zeal and assiduity in his professional duties , that at length he found it expedient to emigrate , his neighbours not having learned from Sir John Falstaff , that “ it is no sin for a man to labour in his vocation . ” He afterwards became a celebrated jester in the English court . In more modern times , he might have found a court in which his virtues would have entitled him to a higher station . He was dismissed in disgrace in the year 1737 , for his insolent wit , of which the following may serve as a specimen . One day when Archbishop Laud was just about to say grace before dinner , Archie begged permission of the king to perform that office in his stead ; and having received it , said , “ All praise to God , and little Laud to the deil . ” The exploit detailed in this ballad has been preserved , with many others of the same kind , by tradition , and is at this time current in Eskdale .</p>
    <p n="647">Or aiblin 's Maggie 's ta'en the yowe .— P . 464. v. 4 .</p>
    <p n="648">There is no district wherein witches seem to have maintained a more extensive , or more recent influence than in Eskdale . It is not long since the system of bribery , alluded to in the next stanza , was carried on in that part of the country . The rowan-tree , or mountain-ash , is well known to be a sure preservative against the power of witchcraft .</p>
