    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">Wishing to make a continued effort , in an art which , though almost in secret , has been adored and assiduously cultivated from earliest infancy , it was my intention to have chosen some incident from Pagan history , as the foundation of my contemplated poem . But , looking over the Jewish annals , I was induced to select for my purpose , one of their well-known stories which besides its extreme beauty , seemed to open an extensive field for the imagination which might therein avail itself not only of important and elevated truths but pleasing and popular superstitions .</p>
    <p n="2">Having finished one Canto I left the United States for the West Indies in the hope of being able to sail thence for Great Britain , where I might submit what I had done to the candour of some able writer ; publish it , if thought expedient ; and obtain advice and materials for the improvement and prosecution of my work . But as events have transpired to frustrate that intention I have endeavored to make it as perfect , as with the means I have access to , is possible .</p>
    <p n="3">It is , now , far beneath what might have been done , under the influence of more decided hopes and more auspicious circumstances . Yet , as it is , I am induced to place it before the public , with that anxiety which naturally attends the doubtful accomplishment of any favourite object , on the principle that no artist can make the same improvement , or labour with so much pleasure to himself , in private , as when comparing his efforts with those of others , and listening to the opinions of critics and the remarks of connoisseurs . The beauty , though she may view herself , in her mirror , from the ringlets of her hair to the sole of her slipper , and appear most lovely to her own gaze , can never be certain of her power to please until the suffrage of society confirm the opinion formed in seclusion ; and “ Qu'est ce que la beaute s'elle ne touche pas ? ”</p>
    <p n="4">Literary employments are necessary to the happiness and almost to the vitality of those who pursue them with much ardour ; and though the votaries of the muses are , too often , debased by faults , yet , abstractedly considered , a taste for any art , if well directed , must seem a preservative not only against melancholy , but even against misery and vice .</p>
    <p n="5">Genius , whatever its bent , supposes a refined and delicate moral sense and though sometimes perverted by sophistry or circumstance , and sometimes failing through weakness ; can always , at least , comprehend and feel , the grandeur of honour and the beauty of virtue .</p>
    <p n="6">As to the faults of those to whom the world allows the possession of genius , there are , perhaps , good grounds for the belief that they have actually fewer than those employed about ordinary affairs ; but the last are easily concealed and the first carefully dragged to light .</p>
    <p n="7">The miseries too , sometimes attendant to persons of distinguished literary attainments , are often held forth as a subject of “ warn and scare ” but Cervantes and Camoens would both have been cast into prison even though unable to read or write , and Savage , though a mechanic or scrivener , would probably have possessed the same failings and consequently have fallen into the same , or a greater degree of poverty and suffering . Alas ! how many , in the flower of youth and strength , perish in the loathsome dungeons of this island , and , when dead , are refused a decent grave ; who , in many instances , were their histories traced by an able pen would be wept by half the civilized world .</p>
    <p n="8">Although I can boast nothing but an extreme and unquenchable love for the art to which my humble aspirations are confined , my lyre has been a solace when every thing else has failed ; soothing when agitated , and when at peace furnishing that exercise and excitement without which the mind becomes sick , and all her faculties retrograde when they ought to be advancing . Men , when they feel that nature has kindled in their bosoms a flame which must incessantly be fed , can cultivate eloquence and exert it , in aid of the unfortunate before the judgment seats of their country ; or endeavour to “ lure to the skies ” such as enter the temples of their god ; but woman , alike subject to trials and vicissitudes and endowed with the same wishes , ( for the observation , “ there is no sex to soul , ” is certainly not untrue ,) condemned , perhaps , to a succession of arduous though minute duties in which , oftentimes , there is nothing to charm and little to distract , unless she be allowed the exercise of her pen must fall into melancholy and despair , and perish , ( to use the language of Mad . de Stael ,) “ consumed by her own energies . ”</p>
    <p n="9">Thus do we endeavour to excuse any inordinate or extreme attachment by labouring to show in their highest colours the merits of its object .</p>
    <p n="10">Zophiel may or may not be called entirely a creature of imagination , as comports with the faith of the reader ; he is not , however , endowed with a single miraculous attribute ; for which the general belief of ages , even among christians , may not be produced as authority .</p>
    <p n="11">The stanza in which his story is told though less complicate and beautiful than the Spencerian , is equally ancient ; and favorable to a pensive melody , is also susceptible of much variety .</p>
    <p n="12">The marginal notes will be useless to such as have read much .</p>
    <p n="13">San Patricio , Island of Cuba , March 30 , 1825 .</p>

     <l n="5">And tresses wild , and robes of loosened flow ,—</l>

     <l n="10">As Egypt 's glowing queen ,</l>
     <l n="11">When her brave Roman learned to love her so</l>
     <l n="12">That death and loss of fame , were , by a smile , repaid .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">Or as thy Sappho , when too fierce assailed</l>
     <l n="14">By stern ingratitude her tender breast :—</l>
     <l n="15">Her love by scorn repaid</l>
     <l n="16">Her friendship true betrayed ,</l>
     <l n="17">Sick of the guileful earth , she sank for rest</l>
     <l n="18">In the cold waves embrace ; while Grecian muse bewailed .</l>

     <l n="20">Ripe , but untouched by time ; whose frequent blush</l>
     <l n="21">Plays o'er her cheek of truth</l>
     <l n="22">As soft as earliest youth ;</l>
     <l n="23">While thoughts exalted to her mild eye rush —</l>
     <l n="24">And the expanded soul , tells ‘ twas from heaven it came .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">

     <l n="26">The ills that unborn innocents must bear ,</l>
     <l n="27">When doomed to come to earth —</l>
     <l n="28">Bethought — and gave thee birth</l>
     <l n="29">To charm the poison from affliction there ;</l>
     <l n="30">And from his source eternal , bade thee draw .</l>

     <l n="37">And still , as wild barbarians fiercely break</l>
     <l n="38">The graceful column and the marble dome —</l>
     <l n="39">Where arts too long have lain</l>
     <l n="40">Debased at pleasure 's fain ,</l>
     <l n="41">And bleeding justice called on wrath to come ,</l>
     <l n="42">‘ Mid ruins heaped around , thou bidst thy votarists wake .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="43">Methinks I see thee on the broken shrine</l>
     <l n="44">Of some fall'n temple — where the grass waves high</l>
     <l n="45">With many a flowret wild ;</l>
     <l n="46">While some lone , pensive , child</l>
     <l n="47">Looks on the sculpture with a wondering eye</l>

     <l n="1">Or on some beetling cliff — where the mad waves</l>

     <l n="4">Whose sighing warms the air ,</l>

     <l n="15">Till , strengthened by thine aid ,</l>
     <l n="16">He shapes some kindred maid ,</l>
     <l n="17">Pours forth in song the life consuming flame ,</l>
     <l n="18">And for awhile forgets his sufferings and desires .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">Scorner of thoughtless grandeur , thou hast chose</l>
     <l n="20">Thy best-beloved from ruddy Nature 's breast :</l>
     <l n="21">The grotto dark and rude —</l>
     <l n="22">The forest solitude —</l>
     <l n="23">The craggy mount by blushing clouds carest —</l>
     <l n="24">Have altars where thy light etherial glows . [ FN # 2 ]</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>[ FN # 2 ] Every nation , however rude , has , as it has been justly observed , a taste for poetry . This art after all that has and can be said for and against it , is the language of nature , and among the relics of the most polished and learned nations little has survived except such as simply depicts those natural feelings and images which have ever existed and ever must continue . Most of the great poets have been individuals of humble condition rising from the mass of the people by that natural principle which causes the most etherial particles to rise and the denser to sink to the earth . But , as Byron exquisitely says , in one of the most wonderfully beautiful pages he ever composed ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Many are poets who have never penned</l>
     <l n="2">Their inspirations , and , perchance , the best ;</l>
     <l n="3">They felt , they loved , and died ; but would not lend</l>
     <l n="4">Their thoughts to meaner beings ; they comprest</l>
     <l n="5">The god within them , and rejoined the stars</l>
     <l n="6">Unlaurel 'd upon earth . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In the place where I now write amid several hundred Africans of different ages , and nations , the most debased of any on the face of the earth , I have been enabled to observe , even in this , last link of the chain of humanity , the strong natural love for music and poetry .</p>
   <p>Any little incident which occurs on the estate where they toil , and which the greater part of them are never suffered to leave , is immediately made the subject of a rude song which they , in their broken Spanish , sing to their companions ; and thereby relieve a little the monotony of their lives .</p>
   <p>I have observed these poor creatures , under various circumstances , and though , generally , extremely brutal , have , in some instances , heard touches of sentiment from them , when under the influence of grief , equal to any which have flowed from the pen of Rousseau .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Thy sovereign priest by earth 's vile sons was driven</l>
     <l n="2">To make the cold unconscious earth his bed : [ FN # 3 ]</l>
     <l n="3">The damp cave mocked his sighs —</l>
     <l n="4">But from his sightless eyes ,</l>
     <l n="5">Wrung forth by wrongs , the anguished drops he shed ,</l>
     <l n="6">Fell each as an appeal to summon thee from heaven .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Thou sought'st him in his desolation ; placed</l>
     <l n="8">On thy warm bosom his unpillowed head ;</l>
     <l n="9">Bade him for visions live</l>
     <l n="10">More bright than worlds can give ;</l>
     <l n="11">O'er his pale lips thy soul infusive shed</l>
     <l n="12">That left his dust adored where kings decay untraced .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>[ FN # 3 ] “ On the banks of the Meles was shown the spot where Critheis , the mother of Homer , brought him into the world , and the cavern to which he retired to compose his immortal verses . A monument erected to his memory and inscribed with his name stood in the middle of the city — it was adorned with spacious porticos under which the citizens assembled . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Source of deep feeling — of surpassing love —</l>
     <l n="2">Creative power ,— ‘ tis thou hast peopled heaven</l>
     <l n="3">Since man from dust arose</l>
     <l n="4">His birth the cherub owes [ FN # 4 ]</l>
     <l n="5">To thee — by thee his rapturous harp was given</l>
     <l n="6">And white wings tipp 'd with gold that cool the domes above .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>[ FN # 4 ] The Indians ( says M. de Voltaire ) from whom every species of theology is derived , invented the angels and represented them in their ancient book the “ Shasta , ” as immortal creatures , participating in the divinity of their creator ; against whom a great number revolted in heaven , “ Les Parsis ignicoles , qui subsistent encore ont communique a l'auteur de la religion des anciens Perses les noms des anges que les premiers Perses reconnaissaient . On en trouve cent-dix - neuf , parmi desquels ne sont ni Raphael ni Gabriel que les Perses n'adopterent que long-tems apres . Ces mots sont Chaldeens ; ils ne furent connus des Juifs que dans leur captivite . ”</p>

     <l n="2">The slave of Fate , I 've knelt before thy throne ;</l>
     <l n="3">To thy loved courts have sped</l>
     <l n="4">Whene'er my heart has bled ,</l>

   <p>[ FN # 9 ] Every one talks and reads of groves , but it is impossible for those who never felt it , to conceive the effect of such a situation in a warm climate . In this island the woods which are naturally so interwoven with vines as to be impervious to a human being , are in some places , cleared and converted into nurseries for the young coffee-trees which remain sheltered from the sun and wind till sufficiently grown to transplant . To enter one of these “ semilleros , ” as they are here called , at noon day , produces an effect like that anciently ascribed to the waters of Lethe . After sitting down upon the trunk of a fallen cedar or palm-tree , and breathing for a moment , the freshness of the air and the odour of the passion flower , which is one of the most abundant , and certainly the most beautiful of the climate ; the noise of the trees , which are continually kept in motion by the trade winds ; the fluttering and various notes , though not musical , of the birds ; the loftiness of the green canopy , for the trunks of the trees are bare to a great height , and seem like pillars supporting the thick mass of leaves above ; and the rich mellow light which the intense rays of the sun , thus impeded , produce ; have altogether such an effect that one involuntarily forgets every thing but the present , and it requires a strong effort to rise and leave the place .</p>

   <p>[ FN # 11 ] The women , I believe , among all nations of antiquity were accustomed to express violent grief by tearing their hair . This must have been a great and affecting sacrifice to the object bemoaned , as they considered it a part of themselves and absolutely essential to their beauty . Fine hair has been a subject of commendation among all people , and particularly the ancients . Cyrus , when he went to visit his uncle Astyages found him with his eyelashes coloured , and decorated with false locks ; the first Caesar obtained permission to wear the laurel-wreath in order to conceal the bareness of his temples . The quantity and beauty of the hair of Absalom is commemorated in holy writ . The modern oriental ladies also set the greatest value on their hair which they braid and perfume . Thus says the poet Hafiz , whome Sir William Jones styles the Anacreon of Persia ,</p>
   <p>“ Those locks , each curl of which is worth a hundred musk-bags of China , would be sweet indeed , if their scent proceeded from sweetness of temper . ”</p>
   <p>and again ,</p>
   <p>“ When the breeze shall waft the fragrance of thy locks over the tomb of Hafiz , a thousand flowers shall spring from the earth that hides his corse . ”</p>
   <p>Achilles clipped his yellow locks and threw them as a sacrifice upon the funeral pyre of Patroclus .</p>

    <head>NOTES .</head>
    <p n="1">( 1 ) Wandered malignant o'er the erring earth .</p>
    <p n="2">This passage and , indeed the whole poem , is founded on a belief , prevalent in the earlier ages of christianity , that all nations , except the descendents of Abraham , were abandoned by the Almighty , and subjected to the power of daemons or evil spirits . Fontenelle in his “ Histoire des Oracles ” makes the following extract from the works of the Pagan philosopher Porphyry .</p>
    <p n="3">“ Auguste deja vieux and songeant a se choisir un successeur , alla consulter l'oracle de Delphes . L'oracle ne repondoit point , quiqu ‘ Auguste n'epargnat pas de sacrifices . A la fin , cependant , il en tira cette reponse . L'enfant Hebreu a qui tous les Dieux obeissent , me chasse d'ici , and me ronvoie dans les Enfers . Sors de ce temple sans parler . ”</p>
    <p n="4">( 2 ) While friendly shades the sacred rites enshroud .</p>
    <p n="5">The captive Jews , though they sometimes outwardly conformed to the religion of their oppressors , were accustomed to practice their own in secret .</p>
    <p n="6">( 3 ) When fiercer spirits howled , he but complained .</p>
    <p n="7">So Milton . Others more mild retreated to a silent valley singing , With notes angelical , to many a harp , Their own heroic deeds and hapless fall .</p>
    <p n="8">( 4 ) Weary he fainted thro ’ the toilsome hours , And then his mystic nature he sustained On steam of sacrifices , breath of flowers .</p>
    <p n="9">Eusebe dans sa “ Preparation Evangelique ” raporte quantite de passages de Porphyre , ou ce philosophe Payen assure que les mauvais demons sont les auteurs des enchantemens , des philtres , et des malefices ; que le mensonge est essentiel a leur nature ; qu'ils ne font que tromper nos yeux par des spectres et par des fautomes ; qu'ils excitent en nous la plupart de nos passions ; qu'ils ont l'ambition de vouloir passer pour des dieux ; que leurs corps aeriens se nourissent de fumigations de sand repandu et de la graisse des sacrifices ; qu'il n'y a qu'eux qui se melent de rendre des oracles , et a qui cette fonction pleine de tromperic soit tombee en partage .</p>
    <p n="10">Fontenelle , Historie des Oracles .</p>
    <p n="11">Still true To one dear theme , my full soul flowing o'er Would find no room for thought of what it knew ( 5 ) Nor picturing forfeit transport curse me more .</p>
    <p n="12">Si l'homme ( says a modern writer ) constant dans ses affections , pouvoit saus cesse fournir a un sentiment renouvele sans cesse , sans doute la solitude and l'amour l'egaleroient a Dieu meme ; car ce sont la les deux eternel plaisirs du gran Etre .</p>
    <p n="13">A celebrated female , ( Saint Theresa ) used to describe Satan as an unhappy being , who never could know what it was to love .</p>
    <p n="14">( 6 ) And o'er her sense as when the fond night bird Woos the full rose o'erpowering fragrance stole .</p>
    <p n="15">This allusion must be familiar to every general reader of poetry .</p>
    <p n="16">“ The nightingale if he sees the rose becomes intoxicated ; he lets go from his hand the reins prudence . ” Fable of the Gardener and Nightingale .</p>
    <p n="17">Lady Montague also translates a song , if my memory does not deceive me , thus ,</p>
    <p n="18">“ The nightingale now hovers amid the flowers , her passion is to seek roses . ”</p>
    <p n="19">And from the poet Hafiz ,</p>
    <p n="20">“ When the roses wither and the bower loses its sweetness , you have no longer the tale of the nightingale . ”</p>
    <p n="21">Indeed the rose , in Oriental poetry , is seldom mentioned without her paramour the nightingale , which gives reason to suppose that this bird , in those countries where it was first celebrated , had really some natural fondness for the rose ; or perhaps for some insect which took shelter in it . In Sir W. Jones ’ translation of the Persian fable , of “ The Gardener and Nightingale ” we meet with the following distich .</p>
    <p n="22">“ I know not what the rose says under his lips , that he brings back the helpless Nightingales with their mournful notes .</p>
    <p n="23">One day the Gardener , according to his established custom , went to view the roses ; he saw a plaintive nightingale rubbing his head on the leaves of the roses and tearing asunder , with his sharp bill , that volume adorned with gold . ”</p>
    <p n="24">And Gelaleddin Ruzbehar ,</p>
    <p n="25">“ While the nightingale sings thy praises with a loud voice , I am all ear like the stalk of the rosetree . ”</p>
    <p n="26">Pliny , however , in his delightful description of this bird , says nothing , I believe , about the rose .</p>
    <p n="27">( 7 ) Les Perses semblent etre les premiers hommes connus de nous qui parlerent des anges comme d'huissiers celestes , et de porteurs d'ordres .</p>
    <p n="28">Voltaire , Essai sur les moeurs et l'esprit des nations .</p>
    <p n="29">In composing this ode , which was done four years ago , the writer had not the most remote idea , of complimenting any one . Without the slightest pretensions to “ connoiseurship ” she has only described the absolute effect of the pictures alluded to , on an individual , and would only be considered in the light of an insent warming itself in the sun , and grateful for his pervasive influence .</p>
    <p n="30">ODE .</p>
    <p n="31">Thou who wert born of Psyche and of Love And fondly nurst on Poesy 's warm breast Painting , oh , power adored ! My country 's sons have poured To thee their orisons ; and thou hast blest Their votive sighs , nor vainly have they strove .</p>
    <p n="32">Thou who art wont to soothe the varied pain That ceaseless throbs at absent lover 's heart , Who first bestowed thine aid On the young Rhodian maid [ FN # 19 ] When doomed , from him whose love was life , to part , From a lone bard accept an humble heartfelt strain .</p>
    <p n="33">[ FN # 19 ] I do not positively recollect whether the incident , here described is supposed to have transpired at Rhodes , Corinth , or some other place , and have not , at present , the means for ascertaining . Painting is called the Rhodian Art , but I know not if on account of its having been first invented there or for the eminence of the painters which Rhodes produced ; which was so great that an illustrious enemy refrained from burning the city , which he had in his power , out of respect to the genius of Protogenes one of its most celebrated artists .</p>
    <p n="34">‘ Twas the last night the idol youth might stay — E'en now , to bear him from the rosy isle , [ FN # 20 ] The galley waits : he sleeps She silent wakes and weeps — Watches his lips that in light dreaming smile — Twines her soul round his charms and dreads the coming day .</p>
    <p n="35">The dazzling drops her pitious eyes that blind Hushing her struggling sobs she wiped away :— Her tapers paly light Fell on the marble white , Beside the couch where half reclined he lay And of his beauteous face the shadow well defined .</p>
    <p n="36">Loved deity , then first thou cam'st on earth !— Pity for truth in sorrow , called thee here ! Sudden the fair , inspired , With a new thought was fired Her hand urged on by hope — yet , breathing not for fear — She traced the unreal shade — ‘ twas hers — an art had birth .</p>
    <p n="37">[ FN # 20 ] Rhodes , in the Greek tongue , signifies rose or roses . After being made the scene of the loves of Venus and Apollo , the isle ( says Demoustier ) became an enchanting garden , and soon took the name of the flowers it produced .</p>
    <p n="38">By dearest , tenderest feelings still allured , Thou sought'st our wilds far blooming o'er the deep Pleased with the soft employ A fair haired cherub boy O'er a more helpless child his watch to keep Was placed ; and from his sports the long restraint endured .</p>
    <p n="39">Fair as the hues of heaven , the innocent Lay like a phantom born of some mild soul ; A drop , for it had wept A moment ere it slept , O'er its light vermil cheek was seen to roll And its young guardian 's heart drank beauty as he leant .</p>
    <p n="40">That nameless wish to nought but genius known .— Indefinite — but in each fibre felt , Whispered . The boy elate Burned to perpetuate The full pervasive bliss ; enrapt he knelt — Thou saw'st — a pencil 's by — and infant West 's thine own .</p>
    <p n="41">Soon the plumed savage , from his leafy home Emerging , saw and loved the gifted child , And soon , beneath their care , His hands the tints prepare , That strain their shapely limbs , in grandeur wild As thro ’ their arching woods , the desert warriors roam . [ FN # 21 ]</p>
    <p n="42">[ FN # 21 ] Sir Benjamin West , when a child , was presented with the primitive colours by an Indian . See Galt 's Life of West .</p>
    <p n="43">Please he repaid their plans , nor those alone ; Sped by his strength the painted arrow flew ; And oft the soaring bird For shape , or hue preferred , To make a model for his art he knew While sovereign Nature saw — and smiled upon her throne .</p>
    <p n="44">Bold Science , who earth 's caverned depths explores , And soars triumphant ‘ mid new worlds of light ,— Lays bare the heaving heart [ FN # 22 ] Nor suffers life to part — Lures the red lightning from its stormy height — Oft , goddess kneels to thee to save his precious stores .</p>
    <p n="45">[ FN # 22 ] An operation was performed at Paris by M. Richerande in which the heart of a patient , who afterwards recovered , was laid bare .</p>
    <p n="46">The rough-browed warrior on the midnight deck While stealing softness thro ’ his pulses glides , By the moon 's pensive rays Regards with lengthened gaze , The pictured form his scarry bosom hides By day ; that tho ’ death grasp , hangs smiling at his neck .</p>
    <p n="47">When fate has torn from the fond mother 's arms The tender hope her bosom fed , to thee She flies ;— and ere decay Can mar his beauteous prey Her arching eyes , amid their grief , can see , Still dawning bright , to them , its early-blighted charms .</p>
    <p n="48">The generous youth who , fired by love of fame , A victim at her bloody altars fell ; To the beloved ones reft , By aid of thee , has left His form , his lip , his ardent glance , to tell How fair was he on earth who left it for a name .</p>
    <p n="49">The patriot — here a moment let my strain Tremble before thy Stuart — who but he Could bid mild Washington — His god-loved labours done — Thus sit before us breathing majesty , And , in his deep blue eye , still life and soul retain ?</p>
    <p n="50">Methinks , the while I gaze , each graceful line So light imprinted on his forehead fair , Where Wisdom sits serene Of every sense the queen , Seems as an embryo empire still were there , While still his ample breast swells with the vast design .</p>
    <p n="51">And fondly o'er the mellow tints I pause Of her , whose vivid touch shames not her sire ; Bold Genius in his pride Has marked her as his bride , On his bright pinions bids her soul aspire , Nor pay the tribute due by tardier Nature 's laws . [ FN # 23 ]</p>
    <p n="52">[ FN # 23 ] While composing this ode the writer was shown a beautiful specimen from the hand of a young daughter of the celebrated Stuart , who entirely devoted herself to the art .</p>
    <p n="53">But guard thee well young J — e : in his embrace How many seal with death their ectasy ! Too deep , intense , and wild , For one so late a child , I fear me lest the proffered transport be That every earthlier joy absorbent would efface .</p>
    <p n="54">Soft is thy form — amid the unpent air , Pay rosy exercise her just demands : Tho ’ heaven thy lone hours woo Earth still demands her due ; Gay health to guard e'en genius ’ palace stands — And when she takes her flight — e'en genius , must despair .</p>
    <p n="55">Nor those alone doomed to incarnate birth Painting , death-baffler , is it thine to save ! The heavenly shapes that flit , When the entranced fit , Is on , and the charmed soul forgets its earth , Thou bidst to earthly eyes their sky-dipt vestments wave .</p>
    <p n="56">The radiant visions Fancy 's wand uprears When Poesy around has spread her spell , Like summer flowrets dies Refresh the enchanted skies , Where , soft as air , and lovelier for her fears , Bright in her golden robes flies fair-haired Florimell . [ FN # 24 ]</p>
    <p n="57">[ FN # 24 ] The flight of Florimell , from a scene in Spencer 's Faery Queen , is an exquisite little picture by Allston , in the possession of a private gentleman .</p>
    <p n="58">The miracles , in holy record kept , Done — ere one cheering ray of distant light Thro ’ death 's dark portals shown , At thy command alone , Still , still — reacted meet — the astonished sight , Tho ’ rolling ages o'er the scene have swept .</p>
    <p n="59">In this far distant land , which the great deep Perchance embosomed , when that dust was rife , The pale unconscious dead On the strown relics laid Of old Elisha , in his passing sleep , Still , at the hallowed touch , starts back to warmth and life . [ FN # 25 ]</p>
    <p n="60">[ FN # 25 ] Every one must recollect the sublime picture here alluded to .</p>
    <p n="61">Sweet , when the soul is weary of the ills That stern reality presents , to dwell On beauteous forms : they smooth The ruffled sense , and sooth The heart with soft perfection ; till a spell Blends with its troublous pulse , and all its achings stills .</p>
    <p n="62">And who can look nor own the pencil 's power Where tender Ariadne , happy yet , [ FN # 26 ] Lies in a dream of bliss ? The last half-pitying kiss , By falsehood given , her sleeping lip has met — That still seems hovering there like Zephyr o'er a flower .</p>
    <p n="63">[ FN # 26 ] Vanderlyn 's Ariadne .</p>
    <p n="64">The dawn breaks slowly o'er the distant main , To come no more her ingrate hero flies ; While thoughts confiding speak Upon her mantling cheek — Illusion chains the sense — in lowest sighs Whispering — we fear to see her wake to pain .</p>
    <p n="65">But whither wandering ? whatsoe'er has gained Long conning book and heart the white-haired sage ; Cause and remote effect In living semblance dect , The truths divine of many a moral page Thy hand , harmonious Peale , hath at a glance explained .</p>
    <p n="66">STANZAS .</p>
    <p n="67">To meet a friendship such as mine Such feelings must thy heart refine As seldom mortal mind gives birth , ‘ Tis love , without a stain of earth , Fratello del mio cor .</p>
    <p n="68">Tho ’ friendship be its earthly name All pure , from highest heaven , it came ‘ Tis never felt for more than one , And scorns to dwell with Venus ’ son Fratello del mio cor .</p>
    <p n="69">Him let it view not , or it flies Like tender hues of morning-skies , Or morn 's sweet flower , of purple glow . When sunny beams too ardent grow Fratello del mio cor .</p>
    <p n="70">It 's food is looks , its nectar , sighs , Its couch the lip , its throne the eyes The soul its breath ; and so possest , Heaven 's raptures reign in mortal breast . Fratello del mio cor .</p>
    <p n="71">ON THE DEATH OF A LADY .</p>
    <p n="72">Thy home seemed not of earth — so blest — But there has fall'n a shaft of fate — The dove is stricken ; and the nest She warmed and cheered is desolate .</p>
