       <l n="3">April 1808 ; although his sister spent part of the winter of 1807-8 at</l>
       <l n="4">Dove Cottage , while he and Mrs. Wordsworth wintered at Stockton with the</l>
       <l n="5">Hutchinson family . Several of the sonnets which are published in the</l>

       <l n="7">there . I have conjecturally assigned a good many of them to the year</l>
       <l n="8">1806 . Some may have been composed earlier than 1806 , but it is not</l>

     <note>This person was Thomas Wilkinson , a Quaker by religious profession ; by natural constitution of mind — or , shall I venture to say , by God 's grace ? he was something better . He had inherited a small estate , and built a house upon it , near Yanwath , upon the banks of the Emont . I have heard him say that his heart used to beat , in his boyhood , when he heard the sound of a drum and fife . Nevertheless the spirit of adventure in him confined itself in tilling his ground , and conquering such obstacles as stood in the way of its fertility . Persons of his religious persuasion do now , in a far greater degree than formerly , attach themselves to trade and commerce . He kept the old track . As represented in this poem , he employed his leisure hours in shaping pleasant walks by the side of his beloved river , where he also built something between a hermitage and a summer house , attaching to it inscriptions after the manner of Shenstone at his Leasowes . He used to travel from time to time , partly from love of Nature , and partly with religious friends , in the service of humanity . His admiration of genius in every department did him much honour . Through his connection with the family in which Edmund Burke was educated , he became acquainted with that great man , who used to receive him with great kindness and condescension ; and many times I have heard Wilkinson speak of those interesting interviews . He was honoured also by the friendship of Elizabeth Smith , and of Thomas Clarkson and his excellent wife , and was much esteemed by Lord and Lady Lonsdale , and every member of that family . Among his verses ( he wrote many ) are some worthy of preservation ; one little poem in particular , upon disturbing , by prying curiosity , a bird while hatching her young in his garden . The latter part of this innocent and good man 's life was melancholy . He became blind , and also poor , by becoming surety for some of his relations . He was a bachelor . He bore , as I have often witnessed , his calamities with unfailing resignation . I will only add , that while working in one of his fields , he unearthed a stone of considerable size , then another , then two more ; observing that they had been placed in order , as if forming the segment of a circle , he proceeded carefully to uncover the soil , and brought into view a beautiful Druid 's temple , of perfect , though small dimensions . In order to make his farm more compact , he exchanged this field for another , and , I am sorry to add , the new proprietor destroyed this interesting relic of remote ages for some vulgar purpose . The fact , so far as concerns Thomas Wilkinson , is mentioned in the note on a sonnet on Long Meg and her Daughters .— I . F .</note>

       <l n="33">Thomas Wilkinson of Yanwath , the friend of Wordsworth and the subject of</l>

     <p>One of the old race of Cumbrian “ Statesmen ” — men who owned , and themselves cultivated , small bits of land ( see Wordsworth 's letter on The Brothers and Michael , vol . ii . p. 234 ) — he was Wordsworth 's senior by nineteen years , and lived on a patrimonial farm of about forty acres , on the banks of the Emont ,— the stream which , flowing out of Ullswater , divides Cumberland from Westmoreland . He was a Friend , and used to travel great distances to attend religious conferences , or engage in philanthropic work ,— on one occasion riding on his pony from Yanwath to London , to the yearly meeting of the Friends ; and , on another , walking the 300 miles to town , in eight days , for the same purpose . A simple , genuine nature ; serene , refined , hospitable , naive , and humorous withal ; a quaint original man , with a true eye for Nature , a keen relish for rural life ( especially for gardening ) and a happy knack of characterization , whether he undertook descriptions of scenery in the course of his travels , or narrated the incidents which befell him on the way . This is how he writes of his farm , and his work upon it :— “ We have at length some traces of spring ( 6th April 1784 ) ; the primrose under the hedge begins to open her modest flower , the buds begin to swell , and the birds to build ; yet we have still a wide horizon , the mountain tops resign not their snows . The happiest season of the year with me is now commencing — I mean that in which I am at the plough ; my horses pace slowly on before , the larks sing above my head , and the furrow falls at my side , and the face of Nature and my own mind seem to wear a sweet and cheerful tranquillity . ”</p>
     <p>The following extract shows the interest which he took in the very implements of his industry , and may serve as an illustration of Wordsworth 's stanzas on his “ spade . ” “ Eighth month , 16th , 1789 . Yesterday I parted without regret from an old acquaintance — I set by my scythe for this year . I have often this season seen the dark blue mountains before the sun and his rising embroider them with gold . I have had many a good sleep in the shade among fragrant grass and refreshing breezes , and though closely engaged in what may be thought heavy work , I was sensible of the enjoyments of life with uninterrupted health . ” In the closing years of the last century , when the spirit of patriotic ardour was so thoroughly roused in England by the restlessness of France and the ambition of Napoleon , he lived on at his pastoral farm , “ busy with his husbandry . ” In London , he made the acquaintance of Edmund Burke ; and Thomas Clarkson , the philanthropist ,— whose labours for the abolition of the slave trade are matter of history ,— became his intimate friend , and was a frequent visitor at Yanwath . Clarkson afterwards bought an estate near to Wilkinson 's home , on the shores of Ullswater , where he built a house , and named it Eusemere , and there the Wordsworths were not infrequent guests . ( See the note to the poem beginning “ I wandered lonely as a cloud , ” vol . iii . p . 5 . ) Wordsworth stayed at Yanwath for two days in 1806 . The Tours to the British Mountains , with the Descriptive Poems of Lowther and Emont Vale ( London , 1824 ) , have been referred to in the note to The Solitary Reaper , vol . ii . p. 399 , one of the poems in the “ Memorials of a Tour in Scotland , 1803 . ” It is an interesting volume — the prose much superior to the verse — and might be reprinted with advantage . Wilkinson was urged repeatedly to publish his “ Tour through the Highlands , ” but he always declined , and it was printed at last without his knowledge , by some one to whom he had lent his MS .</p>
     <p>Wilkinson 's relations to Wordsworth are alluded to in the note to The Solitary Reaper . He is occasionally referred to in Dorothy Wordsworth 's Grasmere Journal of January and March 1802 , e. g . :— “ Monday , 12th March .— The ground covered with snow . Walked to T. Wilkinson 's and sent for letters . The woman brought me one from Wm . and Mary . It was a sharp windy night . Thomas Wilkinson came with me to Barton , and questioned me like a catechiser all the way . Every question was like the snapping of a little thread about my heart . I was so full of thought of my half-read letter and other things . ”</p>
     <p>The following are extracts from letters of Wilkinson to Miss Mary Leadbeater of Ballintore :— “ Yanwath , 15 . 2 . 1801 .— I had lately a young Poet seeing me that sprang originally from the next village . He has left the College , turned his back on all preferment , and settled down contentedly among our Lakes , with his Sister and his Muse . He ... writes in what he conceives to be the language of Nature in opposition to the finery of our present poetry . He has published two volumes of Poems , mostly of the same character . His name is William Wordsworth . ” In a letter , dated 29 . 1 . 1809 , the following occurs :— “ Thou hast wished to have W. Wordsworth 's Lines on my Spade , which I shall transcribe thee . I had promised Lord Lonsdale to take him to Lowther , when he came to see me , but when we arrived he was gone to shoot moor-game with Judge Sutton . William and I then returned , and wrought together at a walk I was then forming , which gave birth to his Verses . ” The expression “ sprang from the next village ” might not be intended to mean that he was born there ; or , if it did , the fact that Wordsworth 's mother was a native of Penrith , and his own visits to that town , might account for the mistake of one who had made no minute enquiry as to the poet 's birthplace . He was born at Cockermouth . Compare an interesting account of Thomas Wilkinson , by Mary Carr , reprinted from the Friends ’ Quarterly Examiner , 1882 .— ED .</p>

      <head>CHARACTER OF THE HAPPY WARRIOR</head>
       <l n="1">Composed 1806 .— Published 1807</l>
     </lg>
     <note>The course of the great war with the French naturally fixed one 's attention upon the military character , and , to the honour of our country , there were many illustrious instances of the qualities that constitute its highest excellence . Lord Nelson carried most of the virtues that the trials he was exposed to in his department of the service necessarily call forth and sustain , if they do not produce the contrary vices . But his public life was stained with one great crime , so that though many passages of these lines were suggested by what was generally known as excellent in his conduct , I have not been able to connect his name with the poem as I could wish , or even to think of him with satisfaction in reference to the idea of what a warrior ought to be . For the sake of such of my friends as may happen to read this note , I will add that many elements of the character here pourtrayed were found in my brother John , who perished by shipwreck , as mentioned elsewhere . His messmates used to call him the Philosopher , from which it must be inferred that the qualities and dispositions I allude to had not escaped their notice . He often expressed his regret , after the war had continued some time , that he had not chosen the Naval , instead of the East India Company 's , service , to which his family connection had led him . He greatly valued moral and religious instruction for youth , as tending to make good sailors . The best , he used to say , came from Scotland ; the next to them , from the North of England , especially from Westmoreland and Cumberland , where , thanks to the piety and local attachments of our ancestors , endowed , or , as they are commonly called , free , schools abound .— I .

     <p>The following note was appended by Wordsworth in the edition of 1807 . “ The above Verses were written soon after tidings had been received of the Death of Lord Nelson , which event directed the Author 's thoughts to the subject . His respect for the memory of his great fellow-countryman induces him to mention this ; though he is well aware that the Verses must suffer from any connection in the Reader 's mind with a Name so illustrious . ”</p>
     <p>This note would seem to warrant our removing the date of the composition of the poem from 1806 to 1805 ; since Lord Nelson died at the battle of Trafalgar , on the 21st of October 1805 . On the other hand , Wordsworth himself gave the date 1806 ; and the “ soon after ” of the above note may perhaps be stretched to include two months and a half . In writing to Sir George Beaumont on the 11th of February 1806 , and enclosing a copy of these verses , he says , “ they were written several weeks ago . ” Southey , writing to Sir Walter Scott , from Keswick , on the 4th of February 1806 , says , “ Wordsworth was with me last week ; he has of late been more employed in correcting his poems than in writing others ; but one piece he has written , upon the ideal character of a soldier , than which I have never seen anything more full of meaning and sound thought . The subject was suggested by Nelson 's most glorious death , though having no reference to it . He had some thoughts of sending it to The Courier , in which case you will easily recognise his hand . ” ( The Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey , vol . iii . p . 19 . ) As it is impossible to decide with accuracy , in the absence of more definite data , I follow the poet 's own statement , and assign it to the year 1806 .</p>
     <p>Wordsworth tells us that features in the character , both of Lord Nelson and of his own brother John , are delineated in this poem . Mr. William Davies writes to me , “ He might very well have set the name of Cuthbert , Lord Collingwood , Nelson 's contemporary , at the head of the poem , as embodying its spirit and lofty rule of life . ” — ED .</p>

       <l n="118">The following note is appended to this poem in the edition of 1807 , and</l>
       <l n="119">in those of 1836 to 1850 :—</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ This Story is a Cumberland tradition ; I have heard it also related of the Hall of Hutton John , an antient residence of the Huddlestones , in a sequestered Valley upon the River Dacor . ”</p>
     <p>Egremont Castle , to which this Cumberland tradition was transferred , is close to the town of Egremont , an ancient borough on the river Ehen , not far from St . Bees . The castle was founded about the beginning of the twelfth century , by William , brother of Ranulph de Meschines , who bestowed on William the whole of the extensive barony of Copeland . The gateway of the castle is vaulted with semi-circular arches , and defended by a strong tower . Westward from the castle area is an ascent to three narrow gates , standing in a line , and close together . These communicated with the outworks , each being defended by a portcullis . Beyond the gates is an artificial mound , seventy-eight feet above the moat ; and on this stood an ancient circular tower . ( See a description of the castle in Britton and Brayley 's Cumberland . ) The river Dacor , or Dacre , referred to in Wordsworth 's note , joins the Emont a short way below Ullswater ; and the hall of Hutton John , which in the reign of Edward III . belonged to the barony of Graystock , passed in the time of Elizabeth to the Huddlestones . The famous Catholic father , John Huddlestone , chaplain to Charles II . and James II ., was of this family .</p>
     <p>In the edition of 1815 , there is the following footnote to the title of the poem :— “ This Poem and the Ballad which follows it ” ( it was that of Goody Blake and Harry Gill ) , “ as they rather refer to the imagination than are produced by it , would not have been placed here ” ( i. e . among the “ Poems of the Imagination ” ) , “ but to avoid a needless multiplication of the Classes . ”</p>
     <p>The text of 1807 underwent no change until 1845 . But — as is shown by the notes in the late Lord Coleridge 's copy of the edition of 1836 — the alterations subsequently adopted in 1845 were made in the interval between these years .— ED .</p>

     <note>Suggested on the Thames by the sight of one of those floating mills that used to be seen there . This I noticed on the Surrey side between Somerset House and Blackfriars ’ Bridge . Charles Lamb was with me at the time ; and I thought it remarkable that I should have to point out to him , an idolatrous Londoner , a sight so interesting as the happy group dancing on the platform . Mills of this kind used to be , and perhaps still are , not uncommon on the continent . I noticed several upon the river Saone in the year 1799 , particularly near the town of Chalons , where my friend Jones and I halted a day when we crossed France ; so far on foot ; there we embarked , and floated down to Lyons .— I .

     <p>Wordsworth went up to London in April 1806 , where he stayed two months . It was , doubtless , on that occasion that these lines were written . The year mentioned in the Fenwick note is incorrect . It was in 1790 that Wordsworth crossed France with his friend Jones .— ED .</p>

     <note>Written at Town-end , Grasmere . The echo came from Nab-scar , when I was walking on the opposite side of Rydal Mere . I will here mention , for my dear Sister 's sake , that , while she was sitting alone one day high up on this part of Loughrigg Fell , she was so affected by the voice of the Cuckoo heard from the crags at some distance that she could not suppress a wish to have a stone inscribed with her name among the rocks from which the sound proceeded . On my return from my walk I recited these verses to Mrs . Wordsworth .— I . F .</note>

     <p>The place where this echo was heard can easily be identified by any one walking along the southern or Loughrigg shore of Rydal . The Fenwick note refers to a wish of Dorothy Wordsworth to have her name inscribed on a stone among the rocks of Loughrigg Fell . It is impossible to know whether it was ever carried out or not . If it was , the place is undiscoverable , like the spot on the banks of the Rotha , where Joanna 's name was graven “ deep in the living rock , ” or the place where Wordsworth carved his wife 's initials ( as recorded in Mrs. Hemans ’ Memoirs ) , or where the daisy was found , which suggested the lines beginning</p>
     <p>Small service is true service while it lasts ;</p>
     <p>and it is well that they are undiscoverable . It is so easy for posterity to vulgarise , by idle and unappreciative curiosity , spots that are sacred only to the few who feel them to be shrines . The very grave where Wordsworth rests runs the risk of being thus abused by the unthinking crowd . But , in the hope that no one will desecrate it , as the Rock of Names has been injured , I may mention that there is a stone near Rydal Mere , on the north-eastern slope of Loughrigg , with the initial “ M . ” deeply cut . The exact locality I need not more minutely indicate .— ED .</p>

     <note>In the cottage , Town-end , Grasmere , one afternoon in 1801 , my sister read to me the sonnets of Milton . I had long been well acquainted with them , but I was particularly struck on that occasion with the dignified simplicity and majestic harmony that runs through most of them ,— in character so totally different from the Italian , and still more so from Shakspeare 's fine sonnets . I took fire , if I may be allowed to say so , and produced three sonnets the same afternoon , the first I ever wrote , except an irregular one at school . Of these three , the only one I distinctly remember is — “ I grieved for Buonaparte . ” One was never written down ; the third , which was , I believe , preserved , I cannot particularise .— I . F .</note>
     <p>From 1807 to 1820 this was named Prefatory Sonnet , as introducing the series of “ Miscellaneous Sonnets ” in these editions . In 1827 it took its place as the first in that series , following the Dedication To ——.— ED .</p>

     <p>In Wordsworth 's time “ Furness-fells ” was a generic phrase for all the hills east of the Duddon , south of the Brathay , and west of Windermere ; including the Coniston group , Wetherlam , with the Yewdale and Tilberthwaite fells . The district of Furness , like that of Craven in Yorkshire , being originally ecclesiastical , had a wide area , of which the abbey of Furness was the centre .</p>
     <p>In the Fenwick note prefixed to this sonnet , Wordsworth refers to his earliest attempt at sonnet writing . He says he wrote an irregular one at school , and the next were three sonnets written one afternoon in Dove Cottage in the year 1801 , after his sister had read the sonnets of Milton . This note is not , however , to be trusted . It was not in 1801 , but on the 21st of May 1802 , that his sister read to him these sonnets of Milton ; and he afterwards wrote not one but two sonnets on Buonaparte . What the irregular sonnet written at school was it is impossible to say , unless he refers to the one entitled , in 1807 and subsequent editions , Written in Very Early Youth ; and beginning —</p>
     <p>Calm is all nature as a resting wheel .</p>
     <p>But on a copy of An Evening Walk ( 1793 edition ) Wordsworth wrote :— “ This is the first of my published poems , with the exception of a sonnet , written when I was a schoolboy , and published in the European Magazine in June or July 1786 , and signed Axiologus . ” Even as to this date his memory was at fault . It was published in 1787 , when he was seventeen years of age . Its full title may be given ; although , for reasons already stated , it would be unjustifiable to republish the sonnet , except in an appendix to the poems , and mainly for its biographical interest . It was entitled , Sonnet , on seeing Miss Maria Williams weep at a Tale of Distress . But , fully ten years before the date mentioned by Dorothy Wordsworth in her Grasmere Journal — as the day on which she read Milton 's sonnets to her brother , and on which he wrote the two on Buonaparte — he had written others , the existence of which he had evidently forgotten . On the 6th of May 1792 , his sister wrote thus from Forncett Rectory in Norfolk to her friend , Miss Jane Pollard :— “ I promised to transcribe some of William 's compositions . As I made the promise , I will give you a little sonnet .... I take the first that offers . It is very valuable to me , because the cause which gave birth to it was the favourite evening walk of William and me .... I have not chosen this sonnet from any particular beauty it has . It was the first I laid my hands upon . ” From the clause I have italicised , it would almost seem that other sonnets belong to that period , viz . before 1793 , when An Evening Walk appeared . She would hardly have spoken of it as she did , if this was the only sonnet her brother had then written . Though very inferior to his later work , this sonnet may be preserved as a specimen of Wordsworth 's earlier manner , before he had broken away , by the force of his own imagination , from the trammels of the conventional style , which he inherited . It is printed in the Appendix to volume viii .</p>
     <p>It will be seen that Wordsworth 's memory cannot be always relied upon , in reference to dates , and similar details , in the Fenwick memoranda .— ED .</p>

     <p>My sister and I were in the habit of having the tea-kettle in our little sitting room ; and we toasted the bread ourselves , which reminds me of a little circumstance not unworthy to be set down among these minutiae . Happening both of us to be engaged a few minutes one morning when we had a young prig of a Scotch lawyer to breakfast with us , my dear Sister , with her usual simplicity , put the toasting fork with a slice of bread into the hands of this Edinburgh genius . Our little book-case stood on one side of the fire . To prevent loss of time , he took down a book , and fell to reading , to the neglect of the toast , which was burnt to a cinder . Many a time have we laughed at this circumstance , and other cottage simplicities of that day . By the bye , I have a spite at one of this series of Sonnets ( I will leave the reader to discover which ) as having been the means of nearly putting off for ever our acquaintance with dear Miss Fenwick , who has always stigmatized one line of it as vulgar , and worthy only of having been composed by a country squire .— I .

     <p>The cottage at Town-end , Grasmere — where this sonnet was composed — may have suggested it . Some of the details , however , are scarcely applicable to Dove Cottage ; the “ brook ” ( referred to elsewhere ) is outside the orchard ground , and there is scarcely anything in the garden to warrant the phrase , “ its own small pasture . ” It is unnecessary to localise the allusions .— ED .</p>

     <p>[ B ] In the editions of 1815 to 1832 ( but not in 1807 ) this line was printed within inverted commas . The quotation marks were dropped , however , in subsequent editions ( as in the quotation from Spenser , in the poem Beggars ) . In a note at the end of the volumes of 1807 , Wordsworth says , “ From a passage in Skelton , which I cannot here insert , not having the Book at hand . ”</p>
     <p>The passage is as follows —</p>

     <p>Raisley Calvert was the son of R. Calvert , steward to the Duke of Norfolk . Writing to Sir George Beaumont , on the 20th February 1805 , Wordsworth said , “ I should have been forced into one of the professions ” ( the church or law ) “ by necessity , had not a friend left me L900 . This bequest was from a young man with whom , though I call him friend , I had but little connection ; and the act was done entirely from a confidence on his part that I had powers and attainments which might be of use to mankind .... Upon the interest of the L900 , and L100 legacy to my sister , and L100 more which the ‘ Lyrical Ballads ’ have brought me , my sister and I contrived to live seven years , nearly eight . ” To his friend Matthews he wrote , November 7th , 1794 , “ My friend ” ( Calvert ) “ has every symptom of a confirmed consumption , and I cannot think of quitting him in his present debilitated state . ” And in January 1795 he wrote to Matthews from Penrith ( where Calvert was staying ) , “ I have been here for some time . I am still much engaged with my sick friend ; and am sorry to add that he worsens daily ... he is barely alive . ” In a letter to Dr. Joshua Stanger of Keswick , written in the year 1842 , Wordsworth referred thus to Raisley Calvert . Dr. Calvert — a nephew of Raisley , and son of the W. Calvert whom the poet accompanied to the Isle of Wight and Salisbury in 1793 — had just died . “ His removal ( Dr. Calvert 's ) has naturally thrown my mind back as far as Dr. Calvert 's grandfather , his father , and sister ( the former of whom was , as you know , among my intimate friends ) , and his uncle Raisley , whom I have so much cause to remember with gratitude for his testamentary remembrance of me , when the greatest part of my patrimony was kept back from us by injustice . It may be satisfactory to your wife for me to declare that my friend 's bequest enabled me to devote myself to literary pursuits , independent of any necessity to look at pecuniary emolument , so that my talents , such as they might be , were free to take their natural course . Your brothers Raisley and William were both so well known to me , and I have so many reasons to respect them , that I cannot forbear saying , that my sympathy with this last bereavement is deepened by the remembrance that they both have been taken from you .... ” On October 1 , 1794 , Wordsworth wrote from Keswick to Ensign William Calvert about his brother Raisley . ( The year is not given in the letter , but it must have been 1794 . ) He tells him that Raisley was determined to set out for Lisbon ; but that he ( Wordsworth ) could not brook the idea of his going alone ; and that he wished to accompany his friend and stay with him , till his health was re-established . He adds , “ Reflecting that his return is uncertain , your brother requests me to inform you that he has drawn out his will , which he means to get executed in London . The purport of his will is to leave you all his property , real and personal , chargeable with a legacy of L600 to me , in case that , on inquiry into the state of our affairs in London , he should think it advisable to do so . It is at my request that this information is communicated to you . ” Calvert did not live to go south ; and he changed the sum left to Wordsworth from L600 to L900 . The relationship of the two men suggests the somewhat parallel one between Spinoza and Simon de Vries .— ED .</p>

     <p>Charles James Fox died September 13 , 1806 . He was Minister for Foreign Affairs at the time , having assumed office on the 5th February , shortly after the death of William Pitt . Wordsworth 's sadness on this occasion , his recognition of Fox as great and good , and as “ a Power ” that was “ passing from the earth , ” may have been due partly to personal and political sympathy , but also probably to Fox 's appreciation of the better side of the French Revolution , and to his welcoming the pacific proposals of Talleyrand , perhaps also to his efforts for the abolition of slavery .</p>
     <p>The “ lonely road ” referred to in these Lines , was , in all likelihood , the path from Town-end towards the Swan Inn past the Hollins , Grasmere . A “ mighty unison of streams ” may be heard there any autumn evening after a stormy day , and especially after long continued rain , the sound of waters from Easdale , from Greenhead Ghyll , and the slopes of Silver How , blending with that of the Rothay in the valley below . Compare Dorothy Wordsworth 's Recollections of a Tour made in Scotland , in 1803 , p. 229 ( edition 1874 ) .— ED .</p>

     <p>Wordsworth dated this poem 1806 , and said to Miss Fenwick that it was written at Grasmere . If it was written “ during a boisterous winter evening ” in 1806 , it could not have been written at Grasmere ; because the Wordsworths spent most of that winter at Coleorton . I am inclined to believe that the date which the poet gave is wrong , and that the Address really belongs to the year 1805 ; but , as it is just possible that — although referring to winter — it may have been written at Town-end in the summer of 1806 , it is placed among the poems belonging to the latter year .</p>
     <p>This Address was translated into French by Mme . Amable Tastu , and published in a popular school-book series of extracts , but Wordsworth 's name is not given along with the translation .</p>
     <p>From 1815 to 1843 the authorship was veiled under the title , “ by a female Friend of the Author . ” In 1845 , it was disclosed , “ by my Sister . ”</p>
     <p>In 1815 Charles Lamb wrote to Wordsworth , “ We were glad to see the poems ‘ by a female friend . ’ The one of the Wind is masterly , but not new to us . Being only three , perhaps you might have clapt a D. at the corner , and let it have past as a printer 's mark to the uninitiated , as a delightful hint to the better instructed . As it is , expect a formal criticism on the poems of your female friend , and she must expect it . ” ( The Letters of Charles Lamb , edited by Alfred Ainger , vol . i. p . 285 . ) — ED .</p>

     <note>This Rill trickles down the hill-side into Windermere , near Low-wood . My sister and I , on our first visit together to this part of the country , walked from Kendal , and we rested to refresh ourselves by the side of the lake where the streamlet falls into it .

     <p>One of the MS. readings of the ninth line of this sonnet gives the date of the incident as “ now seven years gone ” ; but I leave the date of composition undetermined . If we could know accurately the date of the “ first visit ” to the district with his sister ( referred to in the Fenwick note ) , and if we could implicitly trust this MS. reading , it might be possible to fix it ; but we can do neither . Wordsworth visited the Lake District with his sister as early as 1794 , and in December 1799 he took up his abode with her at Dove Cottage . I have no doubt that the sonnet belongs to the year 1806 , or was composed at an earlier date . As to the locality of the rill , the late Rev . R. Perceval Graves , of Dublin , wrote to me :—</p>
     <p>“ It was in 1843 , when quitting the parsonage at Bowness , I went to reside at Dovenest , that , calling one day at Rydal Mount , I was told by both Mr. and Mrs. Wordsworth , as a fact in which I should take a special interest , that the ‘ little unpretending rill ’ associated by the poet with ‘ the immortal spirit of one happy day , ’ was the rill which , rising near High Skelgill at the back of Wansfell , descends steeply down the hill-side , passes behind the house at Dovenest , and crossing beneath the road , enters the lake near the gate of the drive which leads up to Dovenest .</p>
     <p>“ The authority on which I give this information is decisive of the question . I have often traced upwards the course of the rill ; and the secluded hollow , which by its source is beautified with fresh herbage and wild straggling bushes , was a favourite haunt of mine . ” — ED .</p>

     <p>1807</p>
     <p>In few instances is it more evident that the dates which Wordsworth affixed to his poems , in the editions of 1815 , 1820 , 1836 , and 1845 ,— and those assigned in the Fenwick notes — cannot be absolutely relied upon , than in the case of the poems referring to Coleorton . Trusting to these dates , in the absence of contrary evidence , one would naturally assign the majority of the Coleorton poems to the year 1808 . But it is clear that , while the sonnet To Lady Beaumont may have been written in 1806 , the “ Inscription ” For a Seat in the Groves of Coleorton , beginning —</p>
     <p>Beneath yon eastern ridge , the craggy bound ,</p>
     <p>was written , not in 1808 ( as stated by Wordsworth himself ) , but in 1811 ; and that the other “ Inscription ” designed for a Niche in the Winter-garden at Coleorton , belongs ( I think ) to the same year ; a year in which he also wrote the sonnet on Sir George Beaumont 's picture of Bredon Hill and Cloud Hill , beginning —</p>
     <p>Praised be the Art whose subtle power could stay .</p>
     <p>When the dates are so difficult to determine , there is a natural fitness in bringing all the poems referring to Coleorton together , so far as this can be done without seriously interfering with chronological order . The two “ Inscriptions ” intended for the Coleorton grounds , which were written at Grasmere in 1811 , are therefore printed along with the poems of 1807 ; the precise date of each being given — so far as it can be ascertained — underneath its title .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Several political sonnets , and others , were written in 1807 ; also the</l>
       <l n="2">Song at the Feast of Brougham Castle , and the first and larger part of</l>
       <l n="3">The White Doe of Rylstone , with a few minor fragments . But , for</l>
       <l n="4">reasons stated in the notes to The White Doe of Rylstone ( see p .</l>
       <l n="5">191 ) , I have assigned that poem to the year 1808 . The Song at the Feast</l>
       <l n="6">of Brougham Castle forms as natural a preface to The White Doe , as</l>
       <l n="7">The Force of Prayer , a Tradition of Bolton Abbey , is its natural</l>
       <l n="8">appendix . The latter was written , however , before The White Doe of</l>
       <l n="9">Rylstone was finished .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>It would be easier to fix the date of some of the poems written between the years 1806 and 1808 , if we knew the exact month in which the two volumes of 1807 were published ; but this , I fear , it is impossible to discover now .</p>
     <p>On November 10th , 1806 , Wordsworth wrote to Sir George Beaumont from Coleorton , “ In a day or two I mean to send a sheet or two of my intended volume to the press ” ( evidently referring to the “ Poems ” of 1807 ) . On the following day — 11th November 1806 — Dorothy Wordsworth wrote to Lady Beaumont , “ William has written two other poems , which you will see when they are printed . He composes frequently in the grove .... We have not yet received a sheet from the printer . ” On the 15th November 1806 she again wrote to Lady Beaumont ( from Coleorton ) , “ My brother works very hard at his poems , preparing them for the press . Miss Hutchinson is the transcriber . ” In a subsequent letter from Coleorton , undated , but bearing the post-mark February 18 , 1807 , she is speaking of her brother 's poetical labour , and says , “ He must go on , when he begins : and any interruptions ( such as attending to the progress of the workmen and planning the garden ) are of the greatest use to him ; for , after a certain time , the progress is by no means proportioned to the labour in composition ; and if he is called from it by other thoughts , he returns to it with ten times the pleasure , and the work goes on proportionately the more rapidly . ” From this we may infer that the years 1806-7 were productive ones , but it is disappointing that the dates of the composition of the poems are so difficult to determine .— ED .</p>

     <p>The title , To Lady Beaumont , was first given in 1845 . In 1807 it was To the ——; in 1815 , To the Lady ——; and from 1820 to 1843 , To the Lady Beaumont .</p>
     <p>This winter garden , fashioned by the Wordsworths out of the old quarry at Coleorton , during Sir George and Lady Beaumont 's absence in 1807 , exists very much as it was at the beginning of the century . The “ perennial bowers and murmuring pines ” may still be seen , little altered since 1807 . The late Sir George Beaumont ( whose grandfather was first-cousin to the artist Sir George , Wordsworth 's friend ) , with strong reverence for the past , and for the traditions of literary men which have made the district famous since the days of his ancestor Beaumont the dramatist , and especially for the memorials of Wordsworth 's ten months ’ residence at Coleorton ,— took a pleasure in preserving these memorials , very much as they were when he entered in possession of the estates of his ancestors . Such a reverence for the past is not only consistent with the “ improvement ” of an estate , and its belongings ; it is a part of it . Wordsworth , and his wife and sister , were adepts in the laying out of grounds . ( See the reference to the poet 's joint labour with Wilkinson at Yanwath , p . 2 . ) It was the Wordsworths also , I believe , who designed the grounds of Fox How — Dr. Arnold 's residence , near Ambleside . Similar memorials of the poet survive at Hallsteads , Ullswater . The following is an extract from the letter of Dorothy Wordsworth to Lady Beaumont above referred to , and having the post-mark of February 18 , 1807 . “ For more than a week we have had the most delightful weather . If William had but waited a few days , it would have been no anticipation when he said to you , ‘ the songs of Spring were in the grove ; ’ for all this week the birds have chanted from morn till evening , larks , blackbirds , thrushes , and far more than I can name , and the busy rooks have joined their happy voices . ”</p>
     <p>Wordsworth , writing to Sir George Beaumont , November 16 , 1811 , says , “ I remember , Mr. Bowles , the poet , objected to the word ‘ ravishment ’ at the end of the sonnet to the winter-garden ; yet it has the authority of all the first-rate poets , for instance , Milton :</p>
     <p>‘ In whose sight all things joy , with ravishment , Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze ’ .... ” ED .</p>

It is impossible to say to what special incident , if to any in particular , Wordsworth refers in the phrase , “ with holy glee thou fought'st against him ; ” but , as the sonnet was composed at Coleorton in 1807 — after the battles of Austerlitz and Jena , and Napoleon 's practical mastery of Europe — our knowing the particular event or events in Swiss history to which he refers , would not add much to our understanding of the poem .</p>

     <p>On the 25th of March 1807 , the Royal assent was given to the Bill for the Abolition of the Slave Trade . The movement for its abolition was begun by Wilberforce , and carried on by Clarkson . Its abolition was voted by the House of Lords on the motion of Lord Grenville , and by the Commons on the motion of Charles James Fox , on the 10th of June 1806 .

     <p>Mrs. Wordsworth corrected her husband 's note to Miss Fenwick , by adding in the MS ., “ at Coleorton ” ; and at Coleorton the Wordsworths certainly spent the winter of 1806 , the Town-end Cottage at Grasmere being too small for their increasing household . It is more likely that Wordsworth wrote the poem at Coleorton than at Grasmere , and it looks as if it had been an evening impromptu , after hearing both the nightingale and the stock-dove . There are no nightingales at Grasmere ,— they are not heard further north than the Trent valley ,— while they used to abound in the “ peaceful groves ” of Coleorton . If the locality was — as Mrs. Wordsworth states — Coleorton , and if the lines were written after hearing the nightingale , the year would be 1807 , and not 1806 ( the poet 's own date ) . The nightingale is a summer visitor in this country , and could not have been heard by Wordsworth at Coleorton in 1806 , as he did not go south to Leicestershire till November in that year . But it is quite possible that it was “ the stock-dove 's voice ” that alone suggested the lines , and that they were written either in 1806 , or ( as I think more likely ) , very early in 1807 . In the month of January Wordsworth was corresponding with Scott about the poems in this edition of 1807 .— ED .</p>

     <note>Written at Coleorton . This old man 's name was Mitchell . He was , in all his ways and conversation , a great curiosity , both individually and as a representative of past times . His chief employment was keeping watch at night by pacing round the house , at that time building , to keep off depredators . He has often told me gravely of having seen the Seven Whistlers , and the Hounds as here described . Among the groves of Coleorton , where I became familiar with the habits and notions of old Mitchell , there was also a labourer of whom , I regret , I had no personal knowledge ; for , more than forty years after , when he was become an old man , I learned that while I was composing verses , which I usually did aloud , he took much pleasure , unknown to me , in following my steps that he might catch the words I uttered ; and , what is not a little remarkable , several lines caught in this way kept their place in his memory . My volumes have lately been given to him by my informant , and surely he must have been gratified to meet in print his old acquaintances .— I . F .</note>

     <p>To bring all the poems referring to Coleorton together , so far as possible , this and the next sonnet are transferred from their places in the chronological list , and placed beside the Coleorton “ Inscriptions . ”</p>
     <p>I am indebted to Mr. William Kelly of Leicester for the following note on the Leicestershire superstition of the Seven Whistlers .</p>
     <p>“ There is an old superstition , which it is not easy to get to the bottom of , concerning a certain cry or sound heard in the night , supposed to be produced by the Seven Whistlers . What or who those whistlers are is an unsolved problem . In some districts they are popularly believed to be witches , in others ghosts , in others devils , while in the Midland Counties they are supposed to be birds , either plovers or martins — some say swifts . In Leicestershire it is deemed a bad omen to hear the Seven Whistlers , and our old writers supply many passages illustrative of the popular credulity . Spenser , in his Faerie Queene , book II . canto xii . stanza 36 , speaks of</p>
     <p>The whistler shrill , that whoso hears doth die .</p>
     <p>Sir Walter Scott , in The Lady of the Lake , names the bird with which his character associated the cry —</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">And in the plover 's shrilly strain</l>
       <l n="2">The signal whistlers heard again .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ When the colliers of Leicestershire are flush of money , we are told , and indulge in a drinking bout , they sometimes hear the warning voice of the Seven Whistlers , get sobered and frightened , and will not descend the pit again till next day . Wordsworth speaks of a countryman who</p>
     <p>... the seven birds hath seen , that never part , Seen the Seven Whistlers in their nightly rounds , And counted them .</p>
     <p>“ A few years ago , during a thunderstorm which passed over Leicestershire , and while vivid lightning was darting through the sky , immense flocks of birds were seen flying about , uttering doleful , affrighted cries as they passed , and keeping up for a long time a continual whistling like that made by some kinds of sea-birds . The number must have been immense , for the local newspapers mentioned the same phenomenon in different parts of the neighbouring counties of Northampton , Leicester , and Lincoln . A gentleman , conversing with a countryman on the following day , asked him what kind of birds he supposed them to have been . The man answered , ‘ They are what we call the Seven Whistlers , ’ and added that ‘ whenever they are heard it is considered a sign of some great calamity , and that the last time he had heard them was on the night before the deplorable explosion of fire damp at the Hartley Colliery . ’ ”</p>
     <p>In Notes and Queries there are several allusions to this local superstition . In the Fifth Series ( vol . ii . p. 264 ) , Oct. 3 , 1874 , the editor gives a summary of several notes on the subject in vol . viii . of the Fourth Series ( pp . 68 , 134 , 196 , and 268 ) , with additional information . He says “ record was made of their having been heard in Leicestershire ; and that the develin or martin , the swift , and the plover were probably of the whistling fraternity that frightened men . At p. 134 it was shown that Wordsworth had spoken of one who</p>
     <p>... the seven birds hath seen , that never part , Seen the Seven Whistlers in their nightly rounds , And counted them .</p>
     <p>On the same page , the swift is said to be the true whistler ( but , as noted at page 196 , the swifts never make nightly rounds ) , and the superstition is said to be common in our Midland Counties . At page 268 , Mr. Pearson put on record that in Lancashire the plovers , whistling as they fly , are accounted heralds of ill , though sometimes of trivial accident , and that they are there called ‘ Wandering Jews , ’ and are said to be , or to carry with them , the ever-restless souls of those Jews who assisted at the Crucifixion . At page 336 , the whistlers are chronicled as having been the harbingers of the great Hartley Colliery explosion . A correspondent , VIATOR , added , that on the Bosphorus there are flocks of birds , the size of a thrush , which fly up and down the channel , and are never seen to rest on land or water . The men who rowed Viator 's caique told him that they were the souls of the damned , condemned to perpetual motion . The Seven Whistlers have not furnished chroniclers with later circumstances of their tuneful and awful progresses till a week or two ago .... The whistlers are also heard and feared in Portugal . See The New Quarterly for July 1874 , for a record of some travelling experience in that country . ”</p>
     <p>Another extract from Notes and Queries is to the following effect :—</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ ‘ Your Excellency laughs at ghosts . But there is no lie about the</l>
       <l n="2">Seven Whistlers . Many a man besides me has heard them . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">“ ‘ Who are the Seven Whistlers ? and have you seen them yourself ? ’</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ ‘ Not seen , thank Heaven ; but I have heard them plenty of times . Some say they are the ghosts of children unbaptized , who are to know no rest till the judgment day . Once last winter I was going with donkeys and a mule to Caia . Just at the moment I stopped by the river bank to tighten the mule 's girth , I heard the accursed whistlers coming down the wind along the river . I buried my head under the mule , and never moved till the danger was over ; but they passed very near , for I heard the flap and rustle of their wings . ’</p>
     <p>“ ‘ What was the danger ? ’</p>
     <p>“ ‘ If a man once sees them , heaven only knows what will not happen to him — death and damnation at the very least . ’</p>
     <p>“ ‘ I have seen them many times . I shot , or tried to shoot them ! ’</p>
     <p>“ ‘ Holy Mother of God ! you English are an awful people ! You shot the Seven Whistlers ? ’</p>
     <p>“ ‘ Yes ; we call them marecos ( teal or widgeon ) in our country , and shoot them whenever we can . They are better to eat than wild ducks . ’ ”</p>
     <p>Gabriel 's Hounds .— “ At Wednesbury in Staffordshire , the colliers going to their pits early in the morning hear the noise of a pack of hounds in the air , to which they give the name of Gabriel 's Hounds , though the more sober and judicious take them only to be wild geese making this noise in their flight . ” Kennet MS ., Lansd . 1033 . ( See Halliwell 's Dictionary of Archaic and Provincial Words , vol . i. p . 388 . ) The peculiar cry or cackle , both of the Brent Goose and of the Bean or Harvest Goose ( Anser Segetum ) , has often been likened to that of a pack of hounds in full cry — especially when the birds are on the wing during night . For some account of the superstition of “ Gabriel 's Hounds , ” see Notes and Queries , First Series , vol . v. pp . 534 and 596 ; and vol . xii . p. 470 ; Second Series , vol . i. p. 80 ; and Fourth Series , vol . vii . p. 299 . In the last note these hounds are said to be popularly believed to be “ the souls of unbaptized children wandering in the air till the day of judgment . ” They are also explained as “ a thing in the air , that is said in these parts ( Sheffield ) to foretell calamity , sounding like a great pack of beagles in full cry . ” This quotation is from Charles Reade 's Put yourself in his place , which contains many scraps of local folk-lore . The following is from the Statistical History of Kirkmichael , by the Rev . John Grant . “ In the autumnal season , when the moon shines from a serene sky , often is the wayfaring traveller arrested by the music of the hills . Often struck with a more sober scene , he beholds the visionary hunters engaged in the chase , and pursuing the deer of the clouds , while the hollow rocks in long sounding echoes reverberate their cries . ” “ There are several now living who assert that they have seen and heard this aerial hunting . ” See the Statistical History of Scotland , edited by Sir J. Sinclair , vol . xii . pp . 461 , 462 . Compare note to An Evening Walk , vol . i. p . 19 .— ED .</p>

     <p>About twelve years after the last visit of Wordsworth to Coleorton , referred to in the Fenwick note — of which the date should , I think , be 1842 , not 1841 — this cedar tree fell , uprooted during a storm . It was , however , as the Coleorton gardener who was then on the estate told me , replanted with much labour , and protected with care ; although , the top branches being injured , it was never quite the same as it had been . During the night of the great storm on the 13th October 1880 , however , it fell a second time , and perished irretrievably . The memorial stone remains , injured a good deal by the wear and tear of time ; and the inscription is more than half obliterated . It is in a situation much more exposed to the elements than the other two inscriptions at Coleorton . He</p>
     <p>who sang how spear and shield In civil conflict met on Bosworth-field ,</p>
     <p>was Sir John Beaumont , the brother of the dramatist , who wrote a poem on the battle of Bosworth . ( See one of Wordsworth 's notes to the Song at the Feast of Brougham Castle , p . 84 . ) The</p>
     <p>famous Youth , full soon removed From earth ,</p>
     <p>was Francis Beaumont , the dramatist , who wrote in conjunction with Fletcher . He died at the age of twenty-nine .</p>
     <p>In an undated letter addressed to Sir George Beaumont , Wordsworth wrote , “ I like your ancestor 's verses the more , the more I see of them . They are manly , dignified , and extremely harmonious . I do not remember in any author of that age such a series of well-tuned couplets . ”</p>
     <p>In another letter written from Grasmere ( probably in 1811 ) to Sir George , he says in reference to his own poems , “ These inscriptions have all one fault , they are too long ; but I was unable to do justice to the thoughts in less room . The second has brought Sir John Beaumont and his brother Francis so livelily to my mind that I recur to the plan of republishing the former 's poems , perhaps in connection with those of Francis . ”</p>
     <p>On November 16 , 1811 , he wrote to him again , “ I am glad that the inscriptions please you . It did always appear to me , that inscriptions , particularly those in verse , or in a dead language , were never supposed necessarily to be the composition of those in whose name they appeared . If a more striking or more dramatic effect could be produced , I have always thought , that in an epitaph or memorial of any kind , a father or husband , etc ., might be introduced speaking , without any absolute deception being intended ; that is , the reader is understood to be at liberty to say to himself ,— these verses , or this Latin , may be the composition of some unknown person , and not that of the father , widow , or friend , from whose hand or voice they profess to proceed .... I have altered the verses , and I have only to regret that the alteration is not more happily done . But I never found anything more difficult . I wished to preserve the expression patrimonial grounds , [ A ] but I found this impossible , on account of the awkwardness of the pronouns , he and his , as applied to Reynolds , and to yourself . This , even when it does not produce confusion , is always inelegant . I was , therefore , obliged to drop it ; so that we must be content , I fear , with the inscription as it stands below . I hope it will do . I tried a hundred different ways , but cannot hit upon anything better .... ” — ED .</p>

     <note>This Niche is in the sandstone-rock in the winter-garden at Coleorton , which garden , as has been elsewhere said , was made under our direction out of an old unsightly quarry . While the labourers were at work , Mrs. Wordsworth , my sister and I used to amuse ourselves occasionally in scooping this seat out of the soft stone .

     <p>This niche is still to be seen , although not quite “ unconscious of decay . ” The growth of yew-trees , over and around it , has darkened the seat ; and constant damp has decayed the soft stone . The niche having been scooped out by Mrs. Wordsworth and Dorothy , as well as by Wordsworth , suggests the cutting of the inscriptions on the Rock of Names in 1800 , in which they all took part . ( See vol . iii . pp . 61 , 62 . ) On his return to Grasmere from Coleorton , Wordsworth wrote thus to Sir George Beaumont , in an undated letter , about this inscription :— “ What follows I composed yesterday morning , thinking there might be no impropriety in placing it so as to be visible only to a person sitting within the niche , which is hollowed out of the sandstone in the winter-garden . I am told that this is , in the present form of the niche , impossible ; but I shall be most ready , when I come to Coleorton , to scoop out a place for it , if Lady Beaumont think it worth while . ” Then follows the —</p>

     <p>On Nov. 16 , 1811 , writing again to Sir George on this subject of the “ Inscriptions , ” and evidently referring to this one on the “ Niche , ” he says , “ As to the ‘ Female , ’ and ‘ Male , ’ I know not how to get rid of it ; for that circumstance gives the recess an appropriate interest .... On this account , the lines had better be suppressed , for it is not improbable that the altering of them might cost me more trouble than writing a hundred fresh ones . ” — ED .</p>

     <p>After Wordsworth 's return from Coleorton and Stockton to Grasmere , he wrote thus to Sir George Beaumont :—</p>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>“ MY DEAR SIR GEORGE ,</head>
      <head>“ Had there been room at the end of the small avenue of lime-trees for planting a spacious circle of the same trees , the Urn might have been placed in the centre , with the inscription thus altered ,</head>
       <l n="1">“ Ye lime-trees ranged around this hallowed urn ,</l>
       <l n="2">Shoot forth with lively power at spring 's return !</l>
       <l n="3">And be not slow a stately growth to rear ,</l>
       <l n="4">Bending your docile boughs from year to year ,</l>
       <l n="5">Till in a solemn concave they unite ;</l>
       <l n="6">Like that Cathedral Dome beneath whose height</l>
       <l n="7">Reynolds , among our country 's noble Dead ,</l>
       <l n="8">In the last sanctity of fame is laid .</l>
       <l n="9">Here may some Painter sit in future days .</l>
       <l n="10">Some future poet meditate his lays !</l>
       <l n="11">Not mindless of that distant age , renowned ,</l>
       <l n="12">When inspiration hovered o'er this ground ,</l>
       <l n="13">The haunt of him who sang , how spear and shield</l>
       <l n="14">In civil conflict met on Bosworth field ,</l>
       <l n="15">And of that famous youth ( full soon removed</l>

     </lg>
     <p>“ The first couplet of the above , as it before stood , would have appeared ludicrous , if the stone had remained after the trees might have been gone . The couplet relating to the household virtues did not accord with the painter and the poet ; the former being allegorical figures ; the latter , living men . ”</p>
     <p>This letter — which is not now in the Beaumont collection at Coleorton Hall — seems to imply that Wordsworth thought of combining the first couplet on the Urn with the last nine lines of the inscription for the stone behind the Cedar tree . But this was never carried out . The inscriptions are printed in the text as they were carved at Coleorton .— ED .</p>

     <p>refers probably to High Cadmon . The nunnery of Grace Dieu was a religious house , in a retired spot near the centre of the forest ; and was built between 1236 and 1242 . The English monasteries were suppressed in 1536 ; but Grace Dieu , with thirty others of the smaller monasteries , was allowed to continue some time longer . It was finally suppressed in 1539 , when the site of the priory , with the demesne lands , was granted to Sir Humphrey Foster , who conveyed the whole to John Beaumont . Francis Beaumont , the dramatic poet , was born at Grace Dieu in 1586 . He died in 1615 , and was buried in Westminster Abbey .</p>
     <p>“ William and I went to Grace Dieu last week . We were enchanted with the little valley and its nooks , and the rocks of Charnwood upon the hill . ” — Dorothy Wordsworth to Lady Beaumont , November 17 , 1806 .</p>
     <p>This “ Inscription ” was composed at Grasmere , November 19 , 1811 , as the following extract from a letter of Wordsworth 's to Lady Beaumont indicates :— “ Grasmere , Wednesday , November 20 , 1811 .— My Dear Lady Beaumont — When you see this you will think I mean to overrun you with inscriptions . I do not mean to tax you with putting them up , only with reading them . The following I composed yesterday morning in a walk from Brathay , whither I had been to accompany my sister :—</p>

     <p>The original text of this Song was altered but little in succeeding editions , and was not changed at all till 1836 and 1845 . The following is Wordsworth 's explanatory note , appended to the poem in all the editions :—</p>
     <p>“ Henry Lord Clifford , etc . etc ., who is the subject of this Poem , was the son of John , Lord Clifford , who was slain at Towton Field , [ H ] which John , Lord Clifford , as is known to the Reader of English History , was the person who after the battle of Wakefield slew , in the pursuit , the young Earl of Rutland , Son of the Duke of York who had fallen in the battle , ‘ in part of revenge ’ ( say the Authors of the History of Cumberland and Westmoreland ) ; ‘ for the Earl 's Father had slain his . ’ A deed which worthily blemished the author ( saith Speed ) ; But who , as he adds , ‘ dare promise any thing temperate of himself in the heat of martial fury ? chiefly , when it was resolved not to leave any branch of the York line standing ; for so one maketh this Lord to speak . ’ This , no doubt , I would observe by the bye , was an action sufficiently in the vindictive spirit of the times , and yet not altogether so bad as represented ; ‘ for the Earl was no child , as some writers would have him , but able to bear arms , being sixteen or seventeen years of age , as is evident from this ( say the Memoirs of the Countess of Pembroke , who was laudably anxious to wipe away , as far as could be , this stigma from the illustrious name to which she was born ) ; that he was the next Child to King Edward the Fourth , which his mother had by Richard Duke of York , and that King was then eighteen years of age : and for the small distance betwixt her Children , see Austin Vincent in his book of Nobility , page 622 , where he writes of them all . It may further be observed , that Lord Clifford , who was then himself only twenty-five years of age , had been a leading Man and Commander , two or three years together in the Army of Lancaster , before this time ; and , therefore , would be less likely to think that the Earl of Rutland might be entitled to mercy from his youth .— But , independent of this act , at best a cruel and savage one , the Family of Clifford had done enough to draw upon them the vehement hatred of the House of York : so that after the Battle of Towton there was no hope for them but in flight and concealment . Henry , the subject of the Poem , was deprived of his estate and honours during the space of twenty-four years ; all which time he lived as a shepherd in Yorkshire , or in Cumberland , where the estate of his Father-in-law ( Sir Lancelot Threlkeld ) lay . He was restored to his estate and honours in the first year of Henry the Seventh . It is recorded that , ‘ when called to parliament , he behaved nobly and wisely ; but otherwise came seldom to London or the Court ; and rather delighted to live in the country , where he repaired several of his Castles , which had gone to decay during the late troubles . ’ Thus far is chiefly collected from Nicholson and Burn ; and I can add , from my own knowledge , that there is a tradition current in the village of Threlkeld and its neighbourhood , his principal retreat , that , in the course of his shepherd life , he had acquired great astronomical knowledge . I cannot conclude this note without adding a word upon the subject of those numerous and noble feudal Edifices , spoken of in the Poem , the ruins of some of which are , at this day , so great an ornament to that interesting country . The Cliffords had always been distinguished for an honourable pride in these Castles ; and we have seen that after the wars of York and Lancaster they were rebuilt ; in the civil Wars of Charles the First , they were again laid waste , and again restored almost to their former magnificence by the celebrated Lady Anne Clifford , Countess of Pembroke , etc . etc . Not more than twenty-five years after this was done , when the Estates of Clifford had passed into the Family of Tufton , three of these Castles , namely Brough , Brougham , and Pendragon , were demolished , and the timber and other materials sold by Thomas Earl of Thanet . We will hope that , when this order was issued , the Earl had not consulted the text of Isaiah , 58th Chap . 12th Verse , to which the inscription placed over the gate of Pendragon Castle , by the Countess of Pembroke ( I believe his Grandmother ) at the time she repaired that structure , refers the reader . ‘ And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places ; thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations , and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach , the restorer of paths to dwell in . ’ The Earl of Thanet , the present possessor of the Estates , with a due respect for the memory of his ancestors , and a proper sense of the value and beauty of these remains of antiquity , has ( I am told ) given orders that they shall be preserved from all depredations . ”</p>
     <p>Compare the reference to the “ Shepherd-lord ” in the first canto of The White Doe of Rylstone , p. 116 , and the topographical allusions there , with this Song . Compare also the life of Anne Clifford , in Hartley Coleridge 's Lives of Distinguished Northerners .</p>

     </lg>
     <p>Brougham Castle , past which the river Emont flows , is about two miles out of Penrith , on the Appleby Road . It is now a ruin , but was once a place of importance . The larger part of it was built by Roger , Lord Clifford , son of Isabella de Veteripont , who placed over the inner door the inscription , “ This made Roger . ” His grandson added the eastern part . The castle was frequently laid waste by the Scottish Bands , and during the Wars of the Roses . The Earl of Cumberland entertained James I. within it , in 1617 , on the occasion of the king 's last return from Scotland ; but it seems to have “ layen ruinous ” from that date , and to have suffered much during the civil wars in the reign of Charles I . In 1651-52 it was repaired by Lady Anne Clifford , Countess Dowager of Pembroke , who wrote thus — “ After I had been there myself to direct the building of it , did I cause my old decayed castle of Brougham to be repaired , and also the tower called the “ Roman Tower , ” in the same old castle , and the court-house , for keeping my courts in , with some dozen or fourteen rooms to be built in it upon the old foundation . ” ( Pembroke Memoirs , i. p . 216 . ) After the time of the Countess Anne , the castle was neglected , and much of the stone , timber , and lead disposed of at public sales : the wainscotting being purchased by the neighbouring villagers .</p>

     </lg>
     <p>This refers to the thirty years interval between 1455 ( the first battle of St. Albans in the wars of the Roses ) and 1485 ( the battle of Bosworth and the accession of Henry VII . )</p>
     <p>Both roses flourish , red and white ,</p>
     <p>Alluding to the marriage of Henry VII . with Elizabeth , which united the two warring lines of York and Lancaster .</p>
     <p>And it was proved in Bosworth-field .</p>
     <p>The battle of Bosworth Field , in Leicestershire , was fought in 1485 .</p>

     <p>Henry VII .— who , as Henry , Earl of Richmond , last scion of the line of Lancaster , had fled to Brittany — returned with Morton , the exiled Bishop of Ely , landed at Milford , advanced through Wales , and met the royal army at Bosworth , where Richard was slain , and Henry crowned king on the battlefield . The “ cry of blood ” refers , doubtless , to the murder of the young princes in the Tower .</p>

       <l n="1">How glad is Skipton at this hour —</l>
       <l n="2">Though lonely , a deserted Tower .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Skipton is the “ capital ” of the Craven district of Yorkshire , as Barrow is the capital of the Furness district of Lancashire and Westmoreland . The castle of Skipton was the chief residence of the Cliffords . Architecturally it is of two periods : the round tower dating from the reign of Edward II ., and the rest from that of Henry VIII . From the time of Robert de Clifford , who fell at Bannockburn ( 1314 ) , until the seventeenth century , the estates of the Cliffords extended from Skipton to Brougham Castle — seventy miles — with only a short interruption of ten miles . The “ Shepherd-lord ” Clifford of this poem was attainted — as explained in Wordsworth 's note — by the triumphant House of York . He was “ committed by his mother to the care of certain shepherds , whose wives had served her , ” and who kept him concealed both in Cumberland , and at Londesborough , in Yorkshire , where his mother 's ( Lady Margaret Vesci ) own estates lay . The old “ Tower ” of Skipton Castle was “ deserted ” during these years when the “ Shepherd-lord ” was concealed in Cumberland .</p>

       <l n="1">How glad Pendragon — though the sleep</l>
       <l n="2">Of years be on her !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Pendragon Castle , in a narrow dell in the forest of Mallerstang , near the source of the Eden , south of Kirkby-Stephen , was another of the castles of the Cliffords . Its building was traditionally ascribed to Uter Pendragon , of Stonehenge celebrity , who was fabled to have tried to make the Eden flow round the castle of Pendragon : hence the distich —</p>

     </lg>
     <p>In the Countess of Pembroke 's Memoirs ( vol . i. pp . 22 , 228 ) , we are told that Idonea de Veteripont “ made a great part of her residence in Westmoreland at Brough Castle , near Stanemore , and at Pendragon Castle , in Mallerstang . ” The castle was burned and destroyed by Scottish raiders in 1341 , and for 140 years it was in a ruinous state . It is probably to this that reference is made in the phrase , “ though the sleep of years be on her . ” During the attainder of Henry Lord Clifford , in the reign of Edward IV ., part of this estate of Mallerstang was granted to Sir William Parr of Kendal Castle . It was again destroyed during the civil wars of the Stuarts , and was restored , along with Skipton and Brougham , by Lady Anne Clifford , in 1660 , who put up an inscription “ ... Repaired in 1660 , so as she came to lye in it herself for a little while in October 1661 , after it had lain ruinous without timber or any other covering since 1541 . Isaiah , chap . lviii . ver . 12 . ” It was again demolished in 1685 .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Rejoiced is Brough , right glad I deem</l>
       <l n="2">Beside her little humble stream .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Brough — the Verterae of the Romans — is called , for distinction 's sake , “ Brough-under-Stainmore ” ( or “ Stanemore ” ) . The “ little humble stream ” is Hillbeck , formerly Hellebeck — ( it was said to derive its name from the waters rushing or “ helleing ” down the channel ) — which descends from Warcop Fell , runs through Market Brough , and joins the Eden below it . The date of the building of the castle of Brough is uncertain , but it is probably older than the Conquest . It was sacked by the Scottish King William in 1174 . It was “ one of the chief residences ” of Idonea de Veteripont ( above referred to ) ; for “ then it was in its prime . ” ( Pemb . Mem ., vol . i. p . 22 . ) Probably she rebuilt it , and changed it from a tower — like Pendragon — into a castle . In the Pembroke Memoirs ( i. p. 108 ) , we read of its subsequent destruction by fire . “ A great misfortune befell Henry Lord Clifford , some two years before his death , which happened in 1521 ; his ancient and great castle of Brough-under-Stanemore was set on fire by a casual mischance , a little after he had kept a great Christmas there , so as all the timber and lead were utterly consumed , and nothing left but the bare walls , which since are more and more consumed , and quite ruinated . ” This same Countess Anne Pembroke began to repair it in April 1660 , “ at her exceeding great charge and cost . ” She put up an inscription over the gate similar to the one which she inscribed at Pendragon .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">And she that keepeth watch and ward</l>
       <l n="2">Her statelier Eden 's course to guard .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Doubtless Appleby Castle . Its origin is equally uncertain . Before 1422 , John Lord Clifford , “ builded that strong and fine artificial gate-house , all arched with stone , and decorated with the arms of the Veteriponts , Cliffords , and Percys , which with several parts of the castle walls was defaced and broken down in the civil war of 1648 . ” His successor , Thomas , Lord Clifford , “ built the chiefest part of the castle towards the east , as the hall , the chapel , and the great chamber . ” This was in 1454 . The Countess Anne Pembroke wrote of Appleby Castle thus ( Pemb . Mem ., vol . i. p. 187 ): “ In 1651 I continued to live in Appleby Castle a whole year , and spent much time in repairing it and Brougham Castle , to make them as habitable as I could , though Brougham was very ruinous , and much out of repair . And in this year , the 21st of April , I helped to lay the foundation stone of the middle wall of the great tower of Appleby Castle , called “ Caesar 's Tower , ” to the end it might be repaired again , and made habitable , if it pleased God ( Is . lviii . 12 ) , after it had stood without a roof or covering , or one chamber habitable in it , since about 1567 , ” etc . etc .</p>

     <p>After restoration to his ancestral estates , the Shepherd-lord preferred to live in comparative retirement . He spent most of his time at Barden Tower ( see notes to The White Doe of Rylstone ) , which he enlarged , and where he lived with a small retinue . He was much at Bolton ( which was close at hand ) , and there he studied astronomy and alchemy , aided by the monks . It is to the time when he lived at Threlkeld , however — wandering as a shepherd-boy , over the ridges and around the coves of Blencathara , amongst the groves of Mosedale , and by the lofty springs of Glenderamakin — that Wordsworth refers in the lines ,</p>

     <p>The following is Sarah Coleridge 's criticism of the Song at the Feast of Brougham Castle , in the editorial note to her father 's Biographia Literaria ( vol . ii . ch . ix . p. 152 , ed . 1847 ):—</p>
     <p>“ The transitions and vicissitudes in this noble lyric I have always thought rendered it one of the finest specimens of modern subjective poetry which our age has seen . The ode commences in a tone of high gratulation and festivity — a tone not only glad , but comparatively even jocund and light-hearted . The Clifford is restored to the home , the honours and estates of his ancestors . Then it sinks and falls away to the remembrance of tribulation — times of war and bloodshed , flight and terror , and hiding away from the enemy — times of poverty and distress , when the Clifford was brought , a little child , to the shelter of a northern valley . After a while it emerges from those depths of sorrow — gradually rises into a strain of elevated tranquillity and contemplative rapture ; through the power of imagination , the beautiful and impressive aspects of nature are brought into relationship with the spirit of him , whose fortunes and character form the subject of the piece , and are represented as gladdening and exalting it , whilst they keep it pure and unspotted from the world . Suddenly the Poet is carried on with greater animation and passion : he has returned to the point whence he started — flung himself back into the tide of stirring life and moving events . All is to come over again , struggle and conflict , chances and changes of war , victory and triumph , overthrow and desolation . I know nothing , in lyric poetry , more beautiful or affecting than the final transition from this part of the ode , with its rapid metre , to the slow elegiac stanzas at the end , when , from the warlike fervour and eagerness , the jubilant strain which has just been described , the Poet passes back into the sublime silence of Nature , gathering amid her deep and quiet bosom a more subdued and solemn tenderness than he had manifested before ; it is as if from the heights of the imaginative intellect , his spirit had retreated into the recesses of a profoundly thoughtful Christian heart . ”</p>
     <p>Professor Henry Reed said of this poem — “ Had he never written another ode , this alone would set him at the head of the lyric poets of England . ” — ED .</p>

     <p>The poems referring to Coleorton are all transferred to the year 1807 , and The Force of Prayer was written in that year . Those composed in 1808 were few in number . With the exception of The White Doe of Rylstone — to which additions were made in that year — they include only the two sonnets Composed while the Author was engaged in writing a Tract , occasioned by the Convention of Cintra , and the fragment on George and Sarah Green . The latter poem Wordsworth gave to De Quincey , who published it in his “ Recollections of Grasmere , ” which appeared in Tait 's Edinburgh Magazine in September 1839 ; but it never found a place in any edition of Wordsworth 's own poems . In this edition it is printed in the appendix to volume viii .</p>
     <p>The reasons which have led me to assign The White Doe of Rylstone to the year 1808 , are stated in a note to the poem ( see p. 191 ) . I infer that it was practically finished in April 1808 , because Dorothy Wordsworth , in a letter to Lady Beaumont , dated April 20 , 1808 , says , “ The poem is to be published . Longman has consented — in spite of the odium under which my brother labours as a poet — to give him 100 guineas for 1000 copies , according to his demand . ” She gives no indication of the name of the poem referred to . As it must , however , have been one which was to be published separately , she can only refer to The White Doe or to The Excursion ; but the latter poem was not finished in 1808 .</p>
     <p>It is probable , from the remark made in a subsequent letter to Lady Beaumont , February 1810 , that Wordsworth intended either to add to what he had written in 1808 , or to alter some passages before publication ; or by “ completing ” the poem , he may have meant simply adding the Dedication , which was not written till 1815 .</p>
     <p>All things considered , it seems the best arrangement that the poems of 1808 should begin with The White Doe of Rylstone . In the year 1891 I edited this poem for the Clarendon Press . A few additional details have come to light since then , and are introduced into the notes . S. T. Coleridge 's criticism of the poem in Biographia Literaria , vol . ii . chap . xxii . p. 176 ( edition 1817 ) , should be consulted .— ED .</p>

      <head>THE WHITE DOE OF RYLSTONE ;</head>
      <head>OR , THE FATE OF THE NORTONS</head>
       <l n="1">Composed 1807-10 .— Published 1815</l>
     </lg>
     <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
     <p>During the Summer of 1807 , I visited , for the first time , the beautiful country that surrounds Bolton Priory , in Yorkshire ; and the Poem of the WHITE DOE , founded upon a Tradition connected with that place , was composed at the close of the same year .— W . W. [ A ]</p>
     <p>[ The earlier half of this poem was composed at Stockton-upon-Tees , when Mrs. Wordsworth and I were on a visit to her eldest brother , Mr. Hutchinson , at the close of the year 1807 . The country is flat , and the weather was rough . I was accustomed every day to walk to and fro under the shelter of a row of stacks , in a field at a small distance from the town , and there poured forth my verses aloud as freely as they would come . Mrs. Wordsworth reminds me that her brother stood upon the punctilio of not sitting down to dinner till I joined the party ; and it frequently happened that I did not make my appearance till too late , so that she was made uncomfortable . I here beg her pardon for this and similar transgressions during the whole course of our wedded life . To my beloved sister the same apology is due .</p>
     <p>When , from the visit just mentioned , we returned to Town-end , Grasmere , I proceeded with the poem ; and it may be worth while to note , as a caution to others who may cast their eye on these memoranda , that the skin having been rubbed off my heel by my wearing too tight a shoe , though I desisted from walking , I found that the irritation of the wounded part was kept up , by the act of composition , to a degree that made it necessary to give my constitution a holiday . A rapid cure was the consequence . Poetic excitement , when accompanied by protracted labour in composition , has throughout my life brought on more or less bodily derangement . Nevertheless , I am at the close of my seventy-third year , in what may be called excellent health ; so that intellectual labour is not necessarily unfavourable to longevity . But perhaps I ought here to add that mine has been generally carried on out of doors .</p>
     <p>Let me here say a few words of this poem in the way of criticism . The subject being taken from feudal times has led to its being compared to some of Walter Scott 's poems that belong to the same age and state of society . The comparison is inconsiderate . Sir Walter pursued the customary and very natural course of conducting an action , presenting various turns of fortune , to some outstanding point on which the mind might rest as a termination or catastrophe . The course I have attempted to pursue is entirely different . Everything that is attempted by the principal personages in The White Doe fails , so far as its object is external and substantial . So far as it is moral and spiritual it succeeds . The heroine of the poem knows that her duty is not to interfere with the current of events , either to forward or delay them , but</p>
     <p>to abide The shock , and finally secure O'er pain and grief a triumph pure .</p>
     <p>This she does in obedience to her brother 's injunction , as most suitable to a mind and character that , under previous trials , has been proved to accord with his . She achieves this not without aid from the communication with the inferior Creature , which often leads her thoughts to revolve upon the past with a tender and humanising influence that exalts rather than depresses her . The anticipated beatification , if I may so say , of her mind , and the apotheosis of the companion of her solitude , are the points at which the Poem aims , and constitute its legitimate catastrophe , far too spiritual a one for instant or widely-spread sympathy , but not , therefore , the less fitted to make a deep and permanent impression upon that class of minds who think and feel more independently , than the many do , of the surfaces of things and interests transitory , because belonging more to the outward and social forms of life than to its internal spirit . How insignificant a thing , for example , does personal prowess appear compared with the fortitude of patience and heroic martyrdom ; in other words , with struggles for the sake of principle , in preference to victory gloried in for its own sake .— I .

     <p>The following is the full text of the first “ note ” to The White Doe of Rylstone , published in the quarto edition of 1815 . The other notes to that edition are printed in this , at the foot of the pages where they occur :—</p>
     <p>“ The Poem of The White Doe of Rylstone is founded on a local tradition , and on the Ballad in Percy 's Collection , entitled The Rising of the North . The tradition is as follows : ‘ About this time , ’ not long after the Dissolution , ‘ a White Doe , say the aged people of the neighbourhood , long continued to make a weekly pilgrimage from Rylstone over the fells of Bolton , and was constantly found in the Abbey Church-yard during divine service ; after the close of which she returned home as regularly as the rest of the congregation . ’ — Dr. WHITAKER 'S History of the Deanery of Craven .— Rylstone was the property and residence of the Nortons , distinguished in that ill-advised and unfortunate Insurrection , which led me to connect with this tradition the principal circumstances of their fate , as recorded in the Ballad which I have thought it proper to annex .</p>
     <p>The Rising in the North .</p>
     <p>“ The subject of this ballad is the great Northern Insurrection in the 12th year of Elizabeth , 1569 , which proved so fatal to Thomas Percy , the seventh Earl of Northumberland .</p>
     <p>“ There had not long before been a secret negociation entered into between some of the Scottish and English nobility , to bring about a marriage between Mary Q. of Scots , at that time a prisoner in England , and the Duke of Norfolk , a nobleman of excellent character . This match was proposed to all the most considerable of the English nobility , and among the rest to the Earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland , two noblemen very powerful in the North . As it seemed to promise a speedy and safe conclusion of the troubles in Scotland , with many advantages to the crown of England , they all consented to it , provided it should prove agreeable to Queen Elizabeth . The Earl of Leicester ( Elizabeth 's favourite ) undertook to break the matter to her , but before he could find an opportunity , the affair had come to her ears by other hands , and she was thrown into a violent flame . The Duke of Norfolk , with several of his friends , was committed to the Tower , and summons were sent to the Northern Earls instantly to make their appearance at court . It is said that the Earl of Northumberland , who was a man of a mild and gentle nature , [ XX ] was deliberating with himself whether he should not obey the message , and rely upon the Queen 's candour and clemency , when he was forced into desperate measures by a sudden report at midnight , Nov. 14 , that a party of his enemies were come to seize his person . The Earl was then at his house at Topcliffe in Yorkshire . When , rising hastily out of bed , he withdrew to the Earl of Westmoreland at Brancepeth , where the country came in to them , and pressed them to take up arms in their own defence . They accordingly set up their standards , declaring their intent was to restore the ancient Religion , to get the succession of the crown firmly settled , and to prevent the destruction of the ancient nobility , etc . Their common banner ( on which was displayed the cross , together with the five wounds of Christ ) was borne by an ancient gentleman , Richard Norton , Esquire , who , with his sons ( among whom , Christopher , Marmaduke , and Thomas , are expressly named by Camden ) , distinguished himself on this occasion . Having entered Durham , they tore the Bible , etc ., and caused mass to be said there ; they then marched on to Clifford-moor near Wetherby , where they mustered their men .... The two Earls , who spent their large estates in hospitality , and were extremely beloved on that account , were masters of little ready money ; the E. of Northumberland bringing with him only 8000 crowns , and the E. of Westmoreland nothing at all , for the subsistence of their forces , they were not able to march to London , as they had at first intended . In these circumstances , Westmoreland began so visibly to despond , that many of his men slunk away , though Northumberland still kept up his resolution , and was master of the field till December 13 , when the Earl of Sussex , accompanied with Lord Hunsden and others , having marched out of York at the head of a large body of forces , and being followed by a still larger army under the command of Ambrose Dudley , Earl of Warwick , the insurgents retreated northward towards the borders , and there dismissing their followers , made their escape into Scotland . Though this insurrection had been suppressed with so little bloodshed , the Earl of Sussex and Sir George Bowes , marshal of the army , put vast numbers to death by martial law , without any regular trial . The former of these caused at Durham sixty-three constables to be hanged at once . And the latter made his boast , that for sixty miles in length , and forty in breadth , betwixt Newcastle and Wetherby , there was hardly a town or village wherein he had not executed some of the inhabitants . This exceeds the cruelties practised in the West after Monmouth 's rebellion .</p>
     <p>“ Such is the account collected from Stow , Speed , Camden , Guthrie , Carte , and Rapin ; it agrees , in most particulars , with the following Ballad , apparently the production of some northern minstrel .—</p>

     <p>“ ‘ Bolton Priory , ’ says Dr. Whitaker in his excellent book — The History and Antiquities of the Deanery of Craven — ‘ stands upon a beautiful curvature of the Wharf , on a level sufficiently elevated to protect it from inundations , and low enough for every purpose of picturesque effect .</p>
     <p>“ ‘ Opposite to the East window of the Priory Church , the river washes the foot of a rock nearly perpendicular , and of the richest purple , where several of the mineral beds , which break out , instead of maintaining their usual inclination to the horizon , are twisted by some inconceivable process , into undulating and spiral lines . To the South all is soft and delicious ; the eye reposes upon a few rich pastures , a moderate reach of the river , sufficiently tranquil to form a mirror to the sun , and the bounding hills beyond , neither too near nor too lofty to exclude , even in winter , any portion of his rays .</p>
     <p>“ ‘ But , after all , the glories of Bolton are on the North . Whatever the most fastidious taste could require to constitute a perfect landscape is not only found here , but in its proper place . In front , and immediately under the eye , is a smooth expanse of park-like enclosure , spotted with native elm , ash , etc . of the finest growth : on the right a skirting oak wood , with jutting points of grey rock ; on the left a rising copse . Still forward are seen the aged groves of Bolton Park , the growth of centuries ; and farther yet , the barren and rocky distances of Simon-seat and Barden Fell contrasted with the warmth , fertility , and luxuriant foliage of the valley below .</p>
     <p>“ ‘ About half a mile above Bolton the Valley closes , and either side of the Wharf is overhung by solemn woods , from which huge perpendicular masses of grey rock jut out at intervals .</p>
     <p>“ ‘ This sequestered scene was almost inaccessible till of late , that ridings have been cut on both sides of the River , and the most interesting points laid open by judicious thinnings in the woods . Here a tributary stream rushes from a waterfall , and bursts through a woody glen to mingle its waters with the Wharf : there the Wharf itself is nearly lost in a deep cleft in the rock , and next becomes a horned flood enclosing a woody island — sometimes it reposes for a moment , and then resumes its native character , lively , irregular , and impetuous .</p>
     <p>“ ‘ The cleft mentioned above is the tremendous STRID . This chasm , being incapable of receiving the winter floods , has formed , on either side , a broad strand of naked gritstone full of rock-basons , or “ pots of the Linn , ” which bear witness to the restless impetuosity of so many Northern torrents . But , if here Wharf is lost to the eye , it amply repays another sense by its deep and solemn roar , like “ the Voice of the angry Spirit of the Waters , ” heard far above and beneath , amidst the silence of the surrounding woods .</p>
     <p>“ ‘ The terminating object of the landscape is the remains of Barden Tower , interesting from their form and situation , and still more so from the recollections which they excite . ’ ”</p>
     <p>The White Doe of Rylstone has been assigned chronologically to the year 1808 ; although part of it — probably the larger half — was written during the autumn of the previous year , and it remained unfinished in 1810 , while the Dedication was not written till 1815 . In the Fenwick note , Wordsworth tells us that the “ earlier half ” was written at Stockton-on-Tees “ at the close ” of 1807 , and “ proceeded with ” at Dove Cottage , after his return to Grasmere , which was in April 1808 . But on the 28th February , 1810 , Dorothy Wordsworth , writing from Allan Bank to Lady Beaumont , says , “ Before my brother turns to any other labour , I hope he will have finished three books of The Recluse . He seldom writes less than 50 lines every day . After this task is finished he hopes to complete The White Doe , and proud should we all be if it should be honoured by a frontispiece from the pencil of Sir George Beaumont . Perhaps this is not impossible , if you come into the north next summer . ”</p>
     <p>A frontispiece was drawn by Sir George Beaumont for the quarto edition of 1815 .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">When part of the poem was finished , Wordsworth showed it to Southey ; and</l>
       <l n="2">Southey , writing to Walter Scott , in February 1808 , said ,—</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Wordsworth has just completed a most masterly poem upon the fate of the Nortons ; two or three lines in the old ballad of The Rising of the North gave him the hint . The story affected me more deeply than I wish to be affected ; younger readers , however , will not object to the depth of the distress , and nothing was ever more ably treated . He is looking , too , for a narrative subject , pitched in a lower key . ”</p>
     <p>One of the most interesting letters of S. T. Coleridge to Wordsworth is an undated one , sent from London in the spring of 1808 , containing a characteristic criticism of The White Doe . The Wordsworth family had asked Coleridge to discuss the subject of the publication of the poem with the Longmans ’ firm . It is more than probable that it was Coleridge 's criticism of the structural defects in the poem , that led Wordsworth to postpone its publication . The following is part of the letter :—</p>
     <p>“ ... In my reperusals of the poem , it seemed always to strike on my feeling as well as judgment , that if there were any serious defect , it consisted in a disproportion of the Accidents to the spiritual Incidents ; and , closely connected with this ,— if it be not indeed the same ,— that Emily is indeed talked of , and once appears , but neither speaks nor acts , in all the first three-fourths of the poem . Then , as the outward interest of the poem is in favour of the old man 's religious feelings , and the filial heroism of his band of sons , it seemed to require something in order to place the two protestant malcontents of the family in a light that made them beautiful as well as virtuous . In short , to express it far more strongly than I mean or think , in order ( in the present anguish of my spirits ) to be able to express it at all , that three-fourths of the work is everything rather than Emily ; and then , the last — almost a separate and doubtless an exquisite poem — wholly of Emily . The whole of the rest , and the delivering up of the family by Francis , I never ceased to find , not only comparatively heavy , but to me quite obscure as to Francis 's motives . On the few , to whom , within my acquaintance , the poem has been read , either by yourself or me ( I have , I believe , read it only at the Beaumonts ’ ) , it produced the same effect .</p>
     <p>“ Now I have conceived two little incidents , the introduction of which , joined to a little abridgment , and lyrical precipitation of the last half of the third , I had thought would have removed this defect , so seeming to me , and bring to a finer balance the business with the action of the tale . But after my receipt of your letter , concerning Lamb 's censures , I felt my courage fail , and that what I deemed a harmonizing would disgust you as a materialization of the plan , and appear to you like insensibility to the power of the history in the mind . Not that I should have shrunk back from the mere fear of giving transient pain , and a temporary offence , from the want of sympathy of feeling and coincidence of opinions . I rather envy than blame that deep interest in a production , which is inevitable perhaps , and certainly not dishonourable to such as feel poetry their calling and their duty , and which no man would find much fault with if the object , instead of a poem , were a large estate or a title . It appears to me to become a foible only when the poet denies , or is unconscious of its existence , but I did not deem myself in such a state of mind as to entitle me to rely on my own opinion when opposed to yours , from the heat and bustle of these disgusting lectures . ”</p>
     <p>. . . . .</p>
     <p>“ From most of these causes I was suffering , so as not to allow me any rational confidence in my opinions when contrary to yours , which had been formed in calmness and on long reflection . Then I received your sister 's letter , stating the wish that I would give up the thought of proposing the means of correction , and merely point out the things to be corrected , which — as they could be of no great consequence — you might do in a day or two , and the publication of the poem — for the immediacy of which she expressed great anxiety — be no longer retarded . The merely verbal alteranda did appear to me very few and trifling . From your letter on L ——, I concluded that you would not have the incidents and action interfered with , and therefore I sent it off ; but soon retracted it , in order to note down the single words and phrases that I disliked in the books , after the two first , as there would be time to receive your opinion of them during the printing of the two first , in which I saw nothing amiss , except the one passage we altered together , and the two lines which I scratched out , because you yourself were doubtful . Mrs. Shepherd told me that she had felt them exactly as I did — namely , as interrupting the spirit of the continuous tranquil motion of The White Doe . ”</p>
     <p>It will be seen from this letter that Wordsworth had gone over the poem with Coleridge , and that they had altered some passages “ together ” ; that Coleridge had read a copy of it sent to the Beaumonts , doubtless at Dunmow in Essex ; that he had thought of a plan by which the poem could be immensely improved , both by addition and subtraction ; but that hearing from Wordsworth , or more probably from his sister Dorothy , that Charles Lamb had also criticised its structure , he gave up his intention of sending to his friend suggestions , which evidently implied a radical alteration of “ the incidents and action ” of the tale . It would have been extremely interesting to know how the author of Christabel and The Ancient Mariner proposed to recast The White Doe of Rylstone . It is , alas ! impossible for posterity to know this , although it is not difficult to conjecture the line which the alterations would take . Wordsworth 's genius was not great in construction , as in imagination ; and he valued a story only as giving him a “ point of departure ” for a flight of fancy or of idealization . Early in 1808 he wrote to Walter Scott asking him for facts about the Norton family . Scott supplied him with them , and the following was Wordsworth 's reply .</p>
     <p>“ GRASMERE , May 14 , 1808 .</p>
     <p>“ MY DEAR SCOTT — Thank you for the interesting particulars about the Nortons . I like them much for their own sakes ; but so far from being serviceable to my poem , they would stand in the way of it , as I have followed ( as I was in duty bound to do ) the traditionary and common historic account . Therefore I shall say , in this case , a plague upon your industrious antiquarians , that have put my fine story to confusion . ”</p>
     <p>From the “ advertisement ” which Wordsworth prefixed to his edition of 1815 , I infer that the larger part of the poem was written at Stockton . In it he says that “ the Poem of The White Doe was composed at the close of the year ” ( 1807 ) . This is an illustration of the vague manner in which he was in the habit of assigning dates . The Fenwick note , and the evidence of his sister 's letter , is conclusive ; although the fact that The Force of Prayer — written in 1807 — is called in the Fenwick note “ an appendage to The White Doe , ” is further confirmation of the belief that the principal part of the latter poem was finished in 1807 . All things considered , The White Doe of Rylstone may be most conveniently placed after the poems belonging to the year 1807 , and before those known to have been written in 1808 ; while The Force of Prayer naturally follows it .</p>
     <p>The poem — first published in quarto in 1815 — was scarcely altered in the editions of 1820 , 1827 , and 1832 . In 1837 , however , it was revised throughout , and in that year the text was virtually settled ; the subsequent changes being few and insignificant , while those introduced in 1837 were numerous and important . A glance at the foot-notes will show that many passages were entirely rewritten in that year , and that a good many lines of the earlier text were altogether omitted . All the poems were subjected to minute revision in 1836-37 ; but few , if any , were more thoroughly recast , and improved , in that year than The White Doe of Rylstone . As a sample of the best kind of changes — where a new thought was added to the earlier text with admirable felicity — compare the lines in canto vii ., as it stood in 1815 , when the Lady Emily first saw the White Doe at the old Hall of Rylstone , after her terrible losses and desolation —</p>

     <p>In the “ Reminiscences ” of Wordsworth — written by the Hon . Mr. Justice Coleridge for the late Bishop of Lincoln 's Memoirs of his uncle — the following occurs . ( See vol . ii . p . 311 . ) “ His conversation was on critical subjects , arising out of his attempts to alter his poems . He said he considered The White Doe as , in conception , the highest work he had ever produced . The mere physical action was all unsuccessful : but the true action of the poem was spiritual — the subduing of the will , and all inferior fancies , to the perfect purifying and spiritualizing of the intellectual nature ; while the Doe , by connection with Emily , is raised as it were from its mere animal nature into something mysterious and saint-like . He said he should devote much labour to perfecting the execution of it in the mere business parts , in which , from anxiety ‘ to get on ’ with the more important parts , he was sensible that imperfections had crept in which gave the style a feebleness of character . ”</p>
     <p>From this conversation — which took place in 1836 — it will be seen that Wordsworth knew very well that there were feeble passages in the earlier editions ; and that , in the thorough revision which he gave to all his poems in 1836-37 , this one was specially singled out for “ much labour . ” The result is seen by a glance at the changes of the text .</p>
     <p>The notes appended by Wordsworth to the edition of 1815 explain some of the historical and topographical allusions in the poem . To these the following editorial notes may be added —</p>

     <p>In 1153 , the canons of the Augustinian Priory at Embsay , near Skipton , were removed to Bolton , by William Fitz Duncan , and his wife , Cecilia de Romille , who granted it by charter in exchange for the Manors of Skibdem and Stretton . The establishment at Bolton consisted of a prior and about 15 canons , over 200 persons ( including servants and lay brethren ) being supported at Bolton . During the Scottish raids of the fourteenth century , the prior and canons had frequently to retreat to Skipton for safety . In 1542 the site of the priory and demesnes were sold to Harry Clifford , first Earl of Cumberland . From the last Earl of Cumberland it passed to the second Earl of Cork , and then to the Devonshire family , to which it still belongs . The following is part of the excellent account of the Priory , given in Murray 's Yorkshire :—</p>
     <p>“ The chief relic of the Priory is the church , the nave of which after the Dissolution was retained as the chapel of this so-called ‘ Saxon-Cure . ’ This nave remains perfect , but the rest of the church is in complete ruin . The lower walls of the choir are Trans-Norman , and must have been built immediately after ( if not before ) the removal from Embsay . The upper walls and windows ( the tracery of which is destroyed ) are decorated . The nave is early English , and decorated ; and the original west front remains with an elaborate Perpendicular front of excellent design , intended as the base of a western tower , which was never finished .... The nave ( which has been restored under the direction of Crace ) — the</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ ‘ One protected part</l>
       <l n="2">In the shattered fabric 's heart , ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>is Early English on the south side , and Decorated on the north .... At the end of the nave aisle , enclosed by a Perpendicular screen , is a chantry , founded by the Mauleverers ; and below it is the vault , in which , according to tradition , the Claphams of Beamsley and their ancestors the Mauleverers were interred upright —</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ ‘ Pass , pass who will , yon chantry door ;</l>
       <l n="2">And , through the chink in the fractured floor</l>
       <l n="3">Look down , and see a griesly sight ;</l>
       <l n="4">A vault where the bodies are buried upright !</l>
       <l n="5">There , face by face , and hand by hand ,</l>
       <l n="6">The Claphams and Mauleverers stand . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Whitaker , however , could never see this ‘ griesly sight ’ through the chink in the floor ; and it is perhaps altogether traditional . The ruined portion of the church is entirely Decorated , with the exception of the lower walls of the choir . The transepts had eastern aisles . The north transept is nearly perfect : the south retains only its western wall , in which are two decorated windows . The piers of a central tower remain ; but at what period it was destroyed , or if it was ever completed , is uncertain . The choir is long and aisleless . Some fragments of tracery remain in the south window , which was a very fine one . Below the window runs a Transitional Norman arcade . Some portions of tomb-slabs remain in the choir .... The church-yard lies on the north side of the ruins . This has been made classic ground by Wordsworth 's poem . ”</p>

     <p>Compare the poem The Force of Prayer , or the Founding of Bolton Priory , p. 204 . Whitaker writes thus of the district of Upper Wharfedale at Barden . “ Grey tower-like projections of rock , stained with the various hues of lichens , and hung with loose and streaming canopies of ling , start out at intervals . ” Before the restoration of Henry Clifford , the Shepherd-lord , to the estates of his ancestors — on the accession of Henry VII .— there was only a keeper 's lodge or tower at Barden , “ one of six which existed in different parts of Barden Forest . The Shepherd-lord , whose early life among the Cumberland Fells led him to seek quiet and retirement after his restoration , preferred Barden to his greater castles , and enlarged ( or rather rebuilt ) it so as to provide accommodation for a moderate train of attendants . ”</p>

     </lg>
     <p>The circumstances which led to the Rising in the North , and the chief incidents of that unfortunate episode in English history , are traced in detail by Mr. Froude , in the fifty-third chapter of his History of England . They are also summarized , in a lecture on The White Doe of Rylstone , by the late Principal Shairp , in his Aspects of Poetry , from which the following passage is an extract ( pp . 346-48 ) .</p>
     <p>“ The incidents on which the White Doe is founded belong to the year 1569 , the twelfth of Queen Elizabeth .</p>
     <p>“ It is well known that as soon as Queen Mary of Scotland was imprisoned in England , she became the centre around which gathered all the intrigues which were then on foot , not only in England but throughout Catholic Europe , to dethrone the Protestant Queen Elizabeth . Abroad , the Catholic world was collecting all its strength to crush the heretical island . The bigot Pope , Pius V ., with the dark intriguer , Philip II . of Spain , and the savage Duke of Alva , were ready to pour their forces on the shores of England .</p>
     <p>“ At home , a secret negotiation for a marriage between Queen Mary and the Duke of Norfolk had received the approval of many of the chief English nobles . The Queen discovered the plot , threw Norfolk and some of his friends into the Tower , and summoned Percy , Earl of Northumberland , and Neville , Earl of Westmoreland , immediately to appear at court . These two earls were known to be holding secret communications with Mary , and longing to see the old faith restored .</p>
     <p>“ On receiving the summons , Northumberland at once withdrew to Brancepeth Castle , a stronghold of the Earl of Westmoreland . Straightway all their vassals rose , and gathered round the two great earls . The whole of the North was in arms . A proclamation went forth that they intended to restore the ancient religion , to settle the succession to the crown , and to prevent the destruction of the old nobility . As they marched forward they were joined by all the strength of the Yorkshire dales , and , among others , by a gentleman of ancient name , Richard Norton , accompanied by eight brave sons . He came bearing the common banner , called the Banner of the Five Wounds , because on it was displayed the Cross with the five wounds of our Lord . The insurgents entered Durham , tore the Bible , caused mass to be said in the cathedral , and then set forward as for York . Changing their purpose on the way , they turned aside to lay siege to Barnard Castle , which was held by Sir George Bowes for the Queen . While they lingered there for eleven days , Sussex marched against them from York , and the earls , losing heart , retired towards the Border , and disbanded their forces , which were left to the vengeance of the enemy , while they themselves sought refuge in Scotland . Northumberland , after a confinement of several years in Loch Leven Castle , was betrayed by the Scots to the English , and put to death . Westmoreland died an exile in Flanders , the last of the ancient house of the Nevilles , earls of Westmoreland . Norton , with his eight sons , fell into the hands of Sussex , and all suffered death at York . It is the fate of this ancient family on which Wordsworth 's poem is founded . ”</p>
     <p>This statement as to the fate of Norton 's sons , however , is not borne out by the historians . Mr. Froude says ( History of England , chap . 53 ) , “ Two sons of old Norton and two of his brothers , after long and close cross-questioning in the Tower , were tried and convicted at Westminster . Two of these Nortons were afterwards pardoned . Two , one of whom was Christopher , the poor youth who had been bewildered by the fair eyes of the Queen of Scots at Bolton , were put to death at Tyburn , with the usual cruelties . ”</p>

       <l n="4">Our fate is theirs , will reach them all .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Little now remains of Rylstone Hall but the site . “ Some garden flowers still , as when Whitaker wrote , mark the site of the pleasaunce . The house fell into decay immediately after the attainder of the Nortons ; and , with the estates here , remained in the hands of the Crown until the second year of James I ., when they were granted to the Earl of Cumberland . Although Wordsworth makes the Nortons raise their famous banner here , they assembled their followers in fact at Ripon ( November 18 , 1569 ) , but their Rylstone tenants rose with them . ”</p>

     <p>Naworth Castle , at the head of the vale of Llanercort , in the Gilsland district of Cumberland , was the seat of the Dacres from the reign of Edward III . George , Lord Dacre , the last heir-male of that family , was killed in 1559 ; and Lord William Howard ( the third son of Thomas , Duke of Norfolk ) , who was made Warden of the Borders by Queen Elizabeth , and did much to introduce order and good government into the district , married the heiress of the Dacre family , and succeeded to the castle and estate of Naworth . The arms over the entrance of the castle are the Howard 's and Dacre 's quartered .</p>

     <p>The Battle of the Standard was fought in 1137 .</p>
     <p>“ One gleam of national glory broke the darkness of the time . King David of Scotland stood first among the partizans of his kinswoman Matilda , and on the accession of Stephen his army crossed the border to enforce her claim . The pillage and cruelties of the wild tribes of Galloway and the Highlands roused the spirit of the north ; baron and freeman gathered at York round Archbishop Thurstan , and marched to the field of Northallerton to await the foe . The sacred banners of St. Cuthbert of Durham , St. Peter of York , St. John of Beverley , and St. Wilfrid of Ripon , hung from a pole fixed in a four-wheeled car , which stood in the centre of the host . ‘ I who wear no armour , ’ shouted the chief of the Galwegians , ‘ will go as far this day as any one with breastplate of mail ; ’ his men charged with wild shouts of ‘ Albin , Albin , ’ and were followed by the Norman knighthood of the Lowlands . The rout , however , was complete ; the fierce hordes dashed in vain against the close English ranks around the Standard , and the whole army fled in confusion to Carlisle . ” ( J. R. Green 's Short History of the English People , p . 99 . )</p>

       <l n="2">Among the wastes of Rylstone Fell</l>
       <l n="3">Above the loftiest ridge or mound</l>
       <l n="4">Where foresters or shepherds dwell ,</l>
       <l n="5">An edifice of warlike frame</l>
       <l n="6">Stands single — Norton Tower its name —</l>

       <l n="9">Dark moor , and gleam of pool and stream</l>
       <l n="10">Upon a prospect without bound .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Some mounds near the tower are thought to have been used as butts for archers ; and there are traces of a strong wall , running from the tower to the edge of a deep glen , whence a ditch runs to another ravine . This was once a pond , used by the Nortons for detaining the red deer within the township of Rylstone , which they asserted was not within the forest of Skipton , and consequently that the Cliffords had no right to hunt therein . The Cliffords eventually became lords of all the Norton lands here . ”</p>

       <l n="1">In January 1816 , Wordsworth wrote thus to his friend Archdeacon</l>
       <l n="2">Wrangham .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Of The White Doe I have little to say , but that I hope it will be acceptable to the intelligent , for whom alone it is written . It starts from a high point of imagination , and comes round , through various wanderings of that faculty , to a still higher — nothing less than the apotheosis of the animal who gives the first of the two titles to the poem . And as the poem thus begins and ends with pure and lofty imagination , every motive and impetus that actuates the persons introduced is from the same source ; a kindred spirit pervades , and is intended to harmonise , the whole . Throughout objects ( the banner , for instance ) derive their influence , not from properties inherent in them , not from what they are actually in themselves , but from such as are bestowed upon them by the minds of those who are conversant with , or affected by , these objects . Thus the poetry , if there be any in the work , proceeds , as it ought to do , from the soul of man , communicating its creative energies to the images of the external world . ”</p>
     <p>The following is from a letter to Southey in the same year :— “ Do you know who reviewed The White Doe in the ‘ Quarterly ’ ? After having asserted that Mr. W. uses his words without any regard to their sense , the writer says that on no other principle can he explain that Emily is always called ‘ the consecrated Emily . ’ Now , the name Emily occurs just fifteen times in the poem ; and out of these fifteen , the epithet is attached to it once , and that for the express purpose of recalling the scene in which she had been consecrated by her brother 's solemn adjuration , that she would fulfil her destiny , and become a soul ,</p>

     <p>In a letter to Wordsworth about The Waggoner , Charles Lamb wrote , June 7 , 1819 , “ I re-read The White Doe of Rylstone ; the title should be always written at length , as Mary Sabilla Novello , a very nice woman of our acquaintance , always signs hers at the bottom of the shortest note .... Manning had just sent it home , and it came as fresh to me as the immortal creature it speaks of . M. sent it home with a note , having this passage in it : ‘ I cannot help writing to you while I am reading Wordsworth 's poem .... ‘ Tis broad , noble , poetical , with a masterly scanning of human actions , absolutely above common readers . ’ ” ( See The Letters of Charles Lamb , edited by Alfred Ainger , vol . ii . pp . 25 , 26 . )</p>
     <p>Henry Crabb Robinson 's judgment , as given in his Diary , June 1815 , is interesting . ( See vol . i. p . 484 . )</p>
     <p>The following is from Principal Shairp 's estimate of The White Doe of Rylstone in his Oxford Lectures , Aspects of Poetry ( chapter xii . pp . 373-76 ) . “ What is it that gives to it ” ( the poem ) “ its chief power and charm ? Is it not the imaginative use which the poet has made of the White Doe ? With her appearance the poem opens , with her re-appearance it closes . And the passages in which she is introduced are radiant with the purest light of poetry . A mere floating tradition she was , which the historian of Craven had preserved . How much does the poet bring out of how little ! It was a high stroke of genius to seize on this slight traditionary incident , and make it the organ of so much . What were the objects which he had to describe and blend into one harmonious whole . They were these :</p>
     <p>“ 1 . The last expiring gleam of feudal chivalry , ending in the ruin of an ancient race , and the desolation of an ancestral home .</p>
     <p>“ 2 . The sole survivor , purified and exalted by the sufferings she had to undergo .</p>
     <p>“ 3 . The pathos of the decaying sanctities of Bolton , after wrong and outrage , abandoned to the healing of nature and time .</p>
     <p>“ 4 . Lastly , the beautiful scenery of pastoral Wharfdale , and of the fells around Bolton , which blend so well with these affecting memories .</p>
     <p>“ All these were before him — they had melted into his imagination , and waited to be woven into one harmonious creation . He takes the White Doe , and makes her the exponent , the symbol , the embodiment of them all . The one central aim — to represent the beatification of the heroine — how was this to be attained ? Had it been a drama , the poet would have made the heroine give forth in speeches , her hidden mind and character . But this was a romantic narrative . Was the poet to make her soliloquise , analyse her own feelings , lay bare her heart in metaphysical monologue ? This might have been done by some modern poets , but it was not Wordsworth 's way of exhibiting character , reflective though he was . When he analyses feelings they are generally his own , not those of his characters . To shadow forth that which is invisible , the sanctity of Emily 's chastened soul , he lays hold of this sensible image — a creature , the purest , most innocent , most beautiful in the whole realm of nature — and makes her the vehicle in which he embodies the saintliness which is a thing invisible . It is the hardest of all tasks to make spiritual things sensuous , without degrading them . I know not where this difficulty has been more happily met ; for we are made to feel that , before the poem closes , the Doe has ceased to be a mere animal , or a physical creature at all , but in the light of the poet 's imagination , has been transfigured into a heavenly apparition — a type of all that is pure , and affecting , and saintly . And not only the chastened soul of her mistress , but the beautiful Priory of Bolton , the whole Vale of Wharfe , and all the surrounding scenery , are illumined by the glory which she makes ; her presence irradiates them all with a beauty and an interest more than the eye discovers . Seen through her as an imaginative transparency , they become spiritualized ; in fact , she and they alike become the symbol and expression of the sentiment which pervades the poem — a sentiment broad and deep as the world . And yet , any one who visits these scenes , in a mellow autumnal day , will feel that she is no alien or adventitious image , imported by the caprice of the poet , but altogether native to the place , one which gathers up and concentrates all the undefined spirit and sentiment which lie spread around it . She both glorifies the scenery by her presence , and herself seems to be a natural growth of the scenery , so that it finds in her its most appropriate utterance . This power of imagination to divine and project the very corporeal image which suits and expresses the image of a scene , Wordsworth has many times shown ....</p>
     <p>“ And so the poem has no definite end , but passes off , as it were , into the illimitable . It rises out of the perturbations of time and transitory things , and , passing upward itself , takes our thoughts with it to calm places and eternal sunshine . ” — ED .</p>

     <p>[ E ] The above extract , which , in 1837 and subsequent editions , follows the Dedication of the poem to Mrs. Wordsworth , is taken from the tragedy of The Borderers , act III . line 405 ( vol . i. p. 187 ) . In the prefatory note to The Borderers — published in 1842 — Wordsworth says he would not have made use of these lines in The White Doe of Rylstone if he could have foreseen the time when he would be induced to publish the tragedy . It is signed M. S. in the 1837-43 editions .</p>
     <p>In a note to the edition of 1837 , he says , “ ‘ Action is transitory , ’ etc . This and the five lines that follow were either read or recited by me , more than thirty years since , to the late Mr. Hazlitt , who quoted some expressions in them ( imperfectly remembered ) in a work of his published several years ago . ”</p>
     <p>In the quarto edition of 1815 the following lines precede the extract from Lord Bacon ; and in the edition of 1820 they follow it . In 1827 they were transferred to the “ Miscellaneous Sonnets . ”</p>

     <p>[ G ] It is to be regretted that at the present day Bolton Abbey wants this ornament : but the Poem , according to the imagination of the Poet , is composed in Queen Elizabeth 's time . “ Formerly , ” says Dr. Whitaker , “ over the Transept was a tower . This is proved not only from the mention of bells at the Dissolution , when they could have had no other place , but from the pointed roof of the choir , which must have terminated westward , in some building of superior height to the ridge . ” — W.

     <p>The place where this Oak tree grew is uncertain .

     <p>[ T ] In the second volume of Poems published by the author , will be found one , entitled , Song at the Feast of Brougham Castle , upon the Restoration of Lord Clifford , the Shepherd , to the Estates and Honours of his Ancestors . To that Poem is annexed an account of this personage [ p. 89 ] , chiefly extracted from Burn 's and Nicholson 's History of Cumberland and Westmoreland . It gives me pleasure to add these further particulars concerning him from Dr. Whitaker , who says , “ he retired to the solitude of Barden , where he seems to have enlarged the tower out of a common keeper 's lodge , and where he found a retreat equally favourable to taste , to instruction , and to devotion . The narrow limits of his residence shew that he had learned to despise the pomp of greatness , and that a small train of servants could suffice him , who had lived to the age of thirty a servant himself . I think this nobleman resided here almost entirely when in Yorkshire , for all his charters which I have seen are dated at Barden .</p>
     <p>“ His early habits , and the want of those artificial measures of time which even shepherds now possess , had given him a turn for observing the motions of the heavenly bodies , and , having purchased such an apparatus as could then be procured , he amused and informed himself by those pursuits , with the aid of the Canons of Bolton , some of whom are said to have been well versed in what was then known of the science .</p>
     <p>“ I suspect this nobleman to have been sometimes occupied in a more visionary pursuit , and probably in the same company .</p>
     <p>“ For , from the family evidences , I have met with two MSS . on the subject of Alchemy , which , from the character , spelling , etc ., may almost certainly be referred to the reign of Henry the Seventh . If these were originally deposited with the MSS . of the Cliffords , it might have been for the use of this nobleman . If they were brought from Bolton at the Dissolution , they must have been the work of those Canons whom he almost exclusively conversed with .</p>
     <p>“ In these peaceful employments Lord Clifford spent the whole reign of Henry the Seventh , and the first years of his son . But in the year 1513 , when almost sixty years old , he was appointed to a principal command over the army which fought at Flodden , and shewed that the military genius of the family had neither been chilled in him by age , nor extinguished by habits of peace .</p>
     <p>“ He survived the battle of Flodden ten years , and died April 23d , 1523 , aged about 70 . I shall endeavour to appropriate to him a tomb , vault , and chantry , in the choir of the church of Bolton , as I should be sorry to believe that he was deposited when dead at a distance from the place which in his life-time he loved so well .</p>
     <p>“ By his last will he appointed his body to be interred at Shap if he died in Westmoreland ; or at Bolton if he died in Yorkshire . ”</p>
     <p>With respect to the Canons of Bolton , Dr. Whitaker shews from MSS . that not only alchemy but astronomy was a favourite pursuit with them .— W . W. 1815 .</p>
     <p>[ U ] Barden Tower is on the western bank of the Wharfe , fully two miles north-west of Bolton Priory , above the Strid .

     <p>[ II ] “ In the night before the battle of Durham was strucken and begun , the 17th day of October , anno 1346 , there did appear to John Fosser , then Prior of the abbey of Durham , a Vision , commanding him to take the holy Corporax-cloth , wherewith St. Cuthbert did cover the chalice when he used to say mass , and to put the same holy relique like to a banner-cloth upon the point of a spear , and the next morning to go and repair to a place on the west side of the city of Durham , called the Red Hills , where the Maid 's Bower wont to be , and there to remain and abide till the end of the battle . To which vision , the Prior obeying , and taking the same for a revelation of God 's grace and mercy by the mediation of holy St. Cuthbert , did accordingly the next morning , with the monks of the said abbey , repair to the said Red Hills , and there most devoutly humbling and prostrating themselves in prayer for the victory in the said battle : ( a great multitude of the Scots running and pressing by them , with intention to have spoiled them , yet had no power to commit any violence under such holy persons , so occupied in prayer , being protected and defended by the mighty Providence of Almighty God , and by the mediation of Holy St. Cuthbert , and the presence of the holy relique ) . And , after many conflicts and warlike exploits there had and done between the English men and the King of Scots and his company , the said battle ended , and the victory was obtained , to the great overthrow and confusion of the Scots , their enemies : And then the said Prior and monks , accompanied with Ralph Lord Nevil , and John Nevil his son , and the Lord Percy , and many other nobles of England , returned home and went to the abbey church , there joining in hearty prayer and thanksgiving to God and holy St. Cuthbert for the victory atchieved that day . ”</p>
     <p>This battle was afterwards called the Battle of Neville 's Cross from the following circumstance :—</p>
     <p>“ On the west side of the city of Durham , where two roads pass each other , a most notable , famous , and goodly cross of stone-work was erected , and set up to the honour of God for the victory there obtained in the field of battle , and known by the name of Nevil 's Cross , and built at the sole cost of the Lord Ralph Nevil , one of the most excellent and chief persons in the said battle . ” The Relique of St. Cuthbert afterwards became of great importance in military events . For soon after this battle , says the same author , “ The prior caused a goodly and sumptuous banner to be made , ( which is then described at great length ,) and in the midst of the same banner-cloth was the said holy relique and corporax-cloth enclosed , etc . etc ., and so sumptuously finished , and absolutely perfected , this banner was dedicated to holy St. Cuthbert , of intent and purpose , that for the future it should be carried to any battle , as occasion should serve ; and was never carried and shewed at any battle but by the especial grace of God Almighty , and the mediation of holy St. Cuthbert , it brought home victory ; which banner-cloth , after the dissolution of the abbey , fell into the possession of Dean WHITTINGHAM , whose wife was called KATHARINE , being a French woman , ( as is most credibly reported by eye-witnesses ,) did most injuriously burn the same in her fire , to the open contempt and disgrace of all ancient and goodly reliques . ” — Extracted from a book entitled , Durham Cathedral , as it stood before the Dissolution of the Monastery . It appears , from the old metrical History , that the above-mentioned banner was carried by the Earl of Surrey to Flodden Field .— W . W. 1815 .</p>

      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>[ NN ] It is so called to this day , and is thus described by Dr. Whitaker . “ Rylstone Fell yet exhibits a monument of the old warfare between the Nortons and Cliffords . On a point of very high ground , commanding an immense prospect , and protected by two deep ravines , are the remains of a square tower , expressly said by Dodsworth to have been built by Richard Norton . The walls are of strong grout-work , about four feet thick . It seems to have been three stories high . Breaches have been industriously made in all the sides , almost to the ground , to render it untenable .</p>
     <p>“ But Norton Tower was probably a sort of pleasure-house in summer , as there are , adjoining to it , several large mounds , ( two of them are pretty entire ,) of which no other account can be given than that they were butts for large companies of archers .</p>
     <p>“ The place is savagely wild , and admirably adapted to the uses of a watch-tower . ” — W. W. 1815 . ( See note VII . p . 201 . ) — ED .</p>
     <p>The remains of Norton Tower are not in the highest point of the Rylstone Fells , but on one of the western ridges : and there are now only four bare roofless rectangular walls . It was originally both a watch-tower and a hunting-tower . Looking towards Malham to the north and north-west , the view is exactly as described in the poem .— ED .</p>
     <p>[ OO ] This extract was first prefixed to canto seventh in the edition of 1837 .— ED .</p>
     <p>[ PP ] “ After the attainder of Richard Norton , his estates were forfeited to the crown , where they remained till the 2d or 3d of James ; they were then granted to Francis Earl of Cumberland . ” From an accurate survey made at that time , several particulars have been extracted by Dr. W. It appears that the mansion-house was then in decay . “ Immediately adjoining is a close , called the Vivery , so called undoubtedly from the French Vivier , or modern Latin Viverium ; for there are near the house large remains of a pleasure-ground , such as were introduced in the earlier part of Elizabeth 's time , with topiary works , fish-ponds , an island , etc . The whole township was ranged by an hundred and thirty red deer , the property of the Lord , which , together with the wood , had , after the attainder of Mr. Norton , been committed to Sir Stephen Tempest . The wood , it seems , had been abandoned to depredations , before which time it appears that the neighbourhood must have exhibited a forest-like and sylvan scene . In this survey , among the old tenants , is mentioned one Richard Kitchen , butler to Mr. Norton , who rose in rebellion with his master , and was executed at Ripon . ” — W. W. 1815 .</p>
     <p>[ QQ ] There are two small streams which rise near Rylstone . One , called Rylstone beck , flows westwards into the Aire . Another makes its way eastwards towards the Wharfe , joins Linton beck , and so enters Wharfe between Linton Church and Grassington Bridge . It is to the latter that Wordsworth refers , although the former is now called Rylstone beck .— ED .</p>
     <p>[ RR ] “ At the extremity of the parish of Burnsal , the valley of Wharf forks off into two great branches , one of which retains the name of Wharfdale to the source of the river ; the other is usually called Littondale , but more anciently and properly Amerdale . Dern-brook , which runs along an obscure valley from the N. W ., is derived from a Teutonic word , signifying concealment . ” — Dr . WHITAKER .— W . W. 1815 .</p>
     <p>The valley of Littondale , as is shown in Wordsworth 's note , once bore the name of Amerdale . Though the name is not now given to the beck , it survives , singularly enough , in one pool in the stream , where it joins the Wharfe , which is still called “ Amerdale Dub . ” — ED .</p>
     <p>[ SS ] From this valley of Litton a small lateral one runs up in a south-westerly direction at Arncliffe , making a “ deep fork , ” and is called Dernbrook . Dern means seclusion , and two or three miles up this ghyll is a farm-house bearing the name of Dernbrook House . “ The phrase ‘ By lurking Dernbrook 's pathless side ’ is so appropriate , ” says the late incumbent of Arncliffe , the Ven . Archdeacon Boyd , in a letter to the editor , “ that it would almost seem that Wordsworth had been there . ” Mr. Boyd adds , “ In the illustrated edition of The White Doe , published by Longmans a few years ago , there is an illustration by Birket Foster of the Dernbrook House , the original of which I had the honour to supply . It is but a short distance — two or three miles — from Malham Tarn . ” — ED .</p>
     <p>[ TT ] On one of the bells of Rylstone church , which seems co-eval with the building of the tower , is this cypher , = J . N .= for John Norton , and the motto , “ = God us ayde .= ” — W. W. 1815 .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ A ring , bearing the same motto , was sold at a sale of antiquities from</l>
       <l n="2">Bramhope Manor , Feb. 1865 . The Norton Shield of Arms is in Rylstone</l>
       <l n="3">Church . ” ( See Murray 's Yorkshire . ) — ED .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>[ UU ] Which is thus described by Dr. Whitaker :— “ On the plain summit of the hill are the foundations of a strong wall , stretching from the S. W. to the N. E. corner of the tower , and to the edge of a very deep glen . From this glen , a ditch , several hundred yards long , runs south to another deep and rugged ravine . On the N. and W. where the banks are very steep , no wall or mound is discoverable , paling being the only fence that would stand on such ground .</p>
     <p>“ From the Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border , it appears that such pounds for deer , sheep , etc ., were far from being uncommon in the south of Scotland . The principle of them was something like that of a wire mouse-trap . On the declivity of a steep hill , the bottom and sides of which were fenced so as to be impassable , a wall was constructed nearly level with the surface on the outside , yet so high within that without wings it was impossible to escape in the opposite direction . Care was probably taken that these enclosures should contain better feed than the neighbouring parks or forests ; and whoever is acquainted with the habits of these sequacious animals , will easily conceive , that if the leader was once tempted to descend into the snare , an herd would follow . ”</p>
     <p>I cannot conclude without recommending to the notice of all lovers of beautiful scenery — Bolton Abbey and its neighbourhood . This enchanting spot belongs to the Duke of Devonshire ; and the superintendance of it has for some years been entrusted to the Rev . William Carr , who has most skilfully opened out its features ; and in whatever he has added , has done justice to the place by working with an invisible hand of art in the very spirit of nature .— W . W. 1815 .</p>
     <p>[ VV ] The late Archdeacon of Craven wrote to me of this , “ There never can have been a Lady Chapel in the usual place at Bolton , for the altar was close to the east window . I never heard of a Saint Mary 's shrine ; but , most probably , the church was dedicated to St. Mary , in which case she ” ( the Lady Emily ) “ would be speaking of the building . In proof of this , the Priory of Embsay was dedicated to St. Mary ; and naturally the dedication , on the removal from Embsay to Bolton , would be renewed . See Whitaker , p. 369 , in extracting from the compotus , ‘ Comp . Monasterii be ’ Mar ’ de Boulton in Craven . ’ ” It may be added that the whole church being dedicated to St. Mary — as in the case of the Cistercian buildings — there would be no Lady Chapel . The mention in detail of “ prostrate altars , ” “ shrines defaced , ” “ fret-work imagery , ” “ plates of ornamental brass , ” and “ sculptured Forms of Warriors ” in the closing canto of The White Doe is — like the “ one sequestered hillock green ” where Francis Norton was supposed to “ sleep in his last abode ” — part of the imaginative drapery of the poem .— ED .</p>

     <note>An appendage to The White Doe . My friend , Mr. Rogers , has also written on the subject . [ B ] The story is preserved in Dr. Whitaker 's History of Craven — a topographical writer of first-rate merit in all that concerns the past ; but such was his aversion from the modern spirit , as shown in the spread of manufactories in those districts of which he treats , that his readers are left entirely ignorant both of the progress of these arts and their real bearing upon the comfort , virtues , and happiness of the inhabitants . While wandering on foot through the fertile valleys and over the moorlands of the Apennine that divide Yorkshire from Lancashire , I used to be delighted with observing the number of substantial cottages that had sprung up on every side , each having its little plot of fertile ground won from the surrounding waste . A bright and warm fire , if needed , was always to be found in these dwellings . The father was at his loom ; the children looked healthy and happy . Is it not to be feared that the increase of mechanic power had done away with many of these blessings , and substituted many ills ? Alas ! if these evils grow , how are they to be checked , and where is the remedy to be found ? Political economy will not supply it ; that is certain ; we must look to something deeper , purer , and higher .— I . F .</note>

     <p>In a letter to Wordsworth in 1815 , Charles Lamb wrote thus of The Force of Prayer , “ Young Romilly is divine ; the reasons of his mother 's grief being remediless . I never saw parental love carried up so high , towering above the other loves . Shakspeare had done something for the filial in Cordelia , and , by implication , for the fatherly too , in Lear 's resentment ; he left it for you to explore the depths of the maternal heart .... When I first opened upon the just mentioned poem , in a careless tone , I said to Mary , as if putting a riddle , ‘ What is good for a bootless bene ? ’ To which , with infinite presence of mind ( as the jest-book has it ) , she answered , ‘ A shoeless pea . ’ It was the first joke she ever made .... I never felt deeply in my life if that poem did not make me feel , both lately and when I read it in MS . ” ( The Letters of Charles Lamb , edited by Alfred Ainger , vol . i. p . 288 . ) — ED .</p>

     <p>Wordsworth began to write on the Convention of Cintra in November 1808 , and sent two articles on the subject to the December ( 1808 ) and January ( 1809 ) numbers of The Courier . The subject grew in importance to him as he discussed it : and he threw his reflections on the subject into the form of a small treatise , the preface to which was dated 20th May 1809 . The full title of this ( so-called ) “ Tract ” is “ Concerning the Relations of Great Britain , Spain , and Portugal to each other , and to the common Enemy , at this crisis ; and specifically as affected by the Convention of Cintra : the whole brought to the test of those Principles , by which alone the Independence and Freedom of Nations can be Preserved or Recovered . ” — ED .</p>

     <p>The poems belonging to the years 1809 and 1810 were mainly sonnets — although The Excursion was being added to at intervals . Of twenty-four which were included by Wordsworth , in the final arrangement of his poems , among those “ dedicated to National Independence and Liberty , ” fourteen belong to the year 1809 , and ten to 1810 . It is difficult to ascertain the principle which guided him in determining the succession of these sonnets . They were not placed in chronological order ; nor is there any historical or topographical reason for their being arranged as they were . I have therefore felt at liberty to depart from his order , to the following extent .</p>
     <p>The six sonnets referring to the Tyrolese have been brought together in one group . Those containing allusions to Spain might have been similarly treated ; but the sonnets on Schill , the King of Sweden , and Napoleon — as arranged by Wordsworth himself — do not break the continuity of the series on Spain , in the same way that the insertion of those on Palafox and Zaragoza interferes with the unity of the Tyrolean group ; and the re-arrangement of the latter series enables me more conveniently to append to it a German translation of the sonnets , and a paper upon them , by Alois Brandl .— ED .</p>

     <p>The expectation that the Germans would rise against the French in 1807 was realised only in the Tyrol . Andreas Hofer , an innkeeper in the Passeierthal , was the chief of the Tyrolese leaders . More than once he called his countrymen to arms , and was successful for a time . The Bavarians , however , defeated him , in October 1809 . He was tried by court-martial , and shot in 1810 .— ED .</p>

     <p>[ A ] I retain this Tyrolese sonnet amongst the others belonging to the same theme ; but , as Hofer was shot in 1810 , it was probably written in that year .— ED .</p>
     <p>I append to this series of sonnets on the Tyrol and the Tyrolese the translation of a paper contributed by Alois Brandl , a Tyrolean , to the Neue Freie Presse of October 22 , 1880 . Herr Brandl was for some time in England investigating the traces of a German literary influence on Coleridge , Wordsworth , and their contemporaries .</p>
     <p>“ It was in the year 1809 ; Napoleon was at the height of his career of victory ; and England alone of all his opponents held the supremacy at sea . For years the English were the only representatives of freedom in Europe . At last it seemed that two fortunate allies arose to join their cause — the insurgents in Spain and in the little land of Tyrol . No wonder then that now British poets sympathised with the victors at the hill of Isel , and praised their courage and their leaders , and at last , when they were overcome by superior forces , laid the laurel wreath of tragic heroism on their graves .</p>
     <p>“ Thirty or forty years before , English poets would scarcely have shown such a lively interest in a war of independence in a foreign country . They stood under the curse of narrow-mindedness and one-sidedness both in politics and in art , so that their smooth-running verses neither sought nor found a response even in the hearts of their own fellow-countrymen . The poets who appeared before the public in the year 1798 with the famous ‘ Lyrical Ballads ’ were the first to strike out a new path . Although differing considerably from one another in other respects , they agreed in their opposition to the conventionality of the old school . ”</p>
     <p>. . . . .</p>
     <p>“ Wordsworth lived in a simple little house on the romantic lake of Grasmere , in the heart of the mountains of Westmoreland . He studied more in his walks over heath and field than in books , and entered with interest into the questions affecting the good of the country people around him . All this of necessity impelled him to take a warm interest in the herdsmen of the Alps .</p>
     <p>“ But the Tyrolese inspired him with still greater interest on political grounds . Like all the lake poets , he was an enthusiastic admirer , not of the French revolution , but of the republic as long as it seemed to desire the realization of the ideas of Liberty , Fraternity , Equality , and the rest of Rousseau 's Arcadian notions ; and it was a bitter disillusion for him , as well as for Klopstock , when this much-praised home of the free rights of man resolved itself into the empire of Napoleon . From this moment he took his place on the side of the enemies of France , and particularly on the side of the Tyrolese , since they had never lost the natural simplicity of their habits , and had regained the hereditary freedom , of which they had been deprived , with the sword . Thus arose the curious paradox , that a republican poet glorified spontaneously the cause of an exceedingly monarchical and conservative country .</p>
     <p>“ Wordsworth gave vent to his enthusiasm in six sonnets , which , as far as power of language and vigour of thought are concerned , form interesting companion-pieces to the poems of the contemporary Tyrolese poet Alois Weissenbach . In the first three sonnets the splendour of the Alpine world , which he knew from his journeys in Switzerland , forms the background of the picture . In the foreground he sees a band of brave and daring men , in whose hearts he thought he could find all his own moral pathos . Many of the features which he has introduced certainly show more ideal fancy than knowledge of detail ; but it was not his purpose to compose a correct report of the war , but to give an exciting description of the heroes of this struggle for independence , in order that , even though they themselves should be overpowered , their spirit might arise again among his own fellow-countrymen . In the fourth sonnet , in his enthusiasm for the Tyrolese , he has treated the German universities with unnecessary severity ; but this does not prove any intentional want of fairness on his part , for at that time our universities stood under general discredit in England as the hotbeds of the wildest metaphysics and political dreams . The events of the year 1813 would probably induce Wordsworth to view them in a more favourable light . Similarly the sixth sonnet is not quite just to Austria ; in particular Wordsworth has made decidedly too little allowance for the fact that the Emperor Franz I. ceded the Tyrol quite against his own will under the pressure of circumstances . But in this case we must not simply impute all the blame to the poet ; for as we see from the diary of his friend Southey , his information as to the doings of Austria was of a most vague and unfavourable character . We , however , cannot have any wish to impute to Austria the sins of ill-advised diplomacy . ”</p>

     <p>Palafox-y-Melzi , Don Joseph ( 1780-1847 ) , immortalized by his heroic defence of Saragossa in 1808-9 . He was of an old Aragon family , and entered the Spanish army at an early age . In 1808 , when twenty-nine years of age , he was appointed governor of Saragossa , by the people of the town , who were menaced by the French armies . He defended it with a few men , against immense odds , and compelled the French to abandon the siege , after sixty-one days ’ attack , and the loss of thousands . Saragossa , however , was too important to lose , and Marshals Mortier and Moncy renewed the siege with a large army . Palafox ( twice defeated outside ) retired to the fortress as before , where the men , women , and children fought in defence , till the city was almost a heap of ruins . Typhus attacked the garrison within , while the French army assailed it from without . Palafox , smitten by the fever , had to give up the command to another , who signed a capitulation next day . He was sent a prisoner to Vincennes , and kept there for nearly five years , till the restoration of Ferdinand VII ., when he was sent back on a secret mission to Madrid . In 1814 he was appointed Captain-General of Aragon ; but for about thirty years — till his death in 1847 — he took no part in public affairs .— ED .</p>

     <p>Ferdinand von Schill , a distinguished Prussian officer , born 1773 , entered the army 1789 , was seriously wounded in the battle of Jena , but took the field again at the head of a free corps . Indignant at the subjection of his country to Buonaparte , he resolved to make a great effort for the liberation of Germany , collected a small body of troops , and commenced operations on the Elbe ; but after a few successes was overpowered and slain at Stralsund , May 31 , 1809 . On June 4 , 1809 , Wordsworth writing to Daniel Stewart , editor of The Courier newspaper , says , “ Many thanks for the newspaper . Schill is a fine fellow . ” The sonnet was doubtless inspired by what he thus heard of Schill .— ED .</p>

     <p>The royal Swede , “ who never did to Fortune bend the knee , ” was Gustavus IV . He abdicated in 1809 , and came to London at the close of the year 1810 . Compare the earlier sonnet on the same King of Sweden ( vol . ii . p. 338 ) , beginning —</p>
     <p>The Voice of song from distant lands shall call .</p>
     <p>In the edition of 1827 , Wordsworth added the following note :— “ In this and a former Sonnet , in honour of the same Sovereign , let me be understood as a Poet availing himself of the situation which the King of Sweden occupied , and of the principles avowed in his manifestos ; as laying hold of these advantages for the purpose of embodying moral truths . This remark might , perhaps , as well have been suppressed ; for to those who may be in sympathy with the course of these Poems , it will be superfluous ; and will , I fear , be thrown away upon that other class , whose besotted admiration of the intoxicated despot here placed in contrast with him , is the most melancholy evidence of degradation in British feeling and intellect which the times have furnished . ” — ED .</p>

     <p>This may refer to Palafox , alluded to in the sonnet ( p. 222 ) beginning , “ And is it among rude untutored Dales , ” and in the one next in order in the series ( p. 223 ) ; although , from the latter sonnet , it would seem that Wordsworth did not know that Palafox was , in 1809 , a prisoner at Vincennes .</p>
     <p>In his edition of the poems published in 1837 , Professor Henry Reed of Philadelphia said , “ He must be dull of heart who , in perusing this series of Poems ‘ dedicated to Liberty , ’ does not feel his affection for his own country — wherever it may be — and his love of freedom , under whatever form of government his lot may have been cast — at once invigorated and chastened into a purer and more thoughtful emotion . ” — ED .</p>

     <p>EPITAPHS TRANSLATED FROM CHIABRERA</p>
     <note>Those from Chiabrera were chiefly translated when Mr. Coleridge was writing his Friend , in which periodical my “ Essay on Epitaphs , ” written about that time , was first published . For further notice of Chiabrera , in connection with his Epitaphs , see Musings near Aquapendente .— I . F .</note>
     <p>It is better to print all the Epitaphs from Chiabrera together , than to spread them out over the years when they were written or published . Some of them were certainly written in 1809 , or at least before 1810 ; others at a later date . But it is impossible to say in what year those published after 1810 were composed . They are all to be found in the class of “ Epitaphs and Elegiac Pieces . ” — ED .</p>

     <p>I have been unable to obtain any definite information in reference to the persons commemorated in these epitaphs by Chiabrera : Francesco Ceni , Titus , Ambrosio Salinero , Roberto Dati , Lelius , Francesco Pozzobonnelli , and Balbi . Mr. W. M. Rossetti writes to me that he “ supposes all the men named by Chiabrera to be such as enjoyed a certain local and temporary reputation , which has hardly passed down to any sort of posterity , and certainly not to the ordinary English reader . ”</p>
     <p>Chiabrera was born at Savona on the 8th of June 1552 , and educated at Rome . He entered the service of Cardinal Cornaro , married in his 50th year , lived to the age of 85 , and died October 14 , 1637 . His poetical faculty showed itself late . “ Having commenced to read the Greek writers at home , he conceived a great admiration for Pindar , and strove successfully to imitate him . He was not less happy in catching the naive and pleasant spirit of Anacreon ; his canzonetti being distinguished for their ease and elegance , while his Lettere Famigliari was the first attempt to introduce the poetical epistle into Italian Literature . He wrote also several epics , bucolics , and dramatic poems . His Opere appeared at Venice , in 6 vols ., in 1768 . ”</p>
     <p>Wordsworth says of him , in his Essay on Epitaphs , where translations of two of those Epitaphs of Chiabrera first appeared ( see The Friend , February 22 , 1810 , and notes to The Excursion ) — “ His life was long , and every part of it bore appropriate fruits . Urbino , his birth-place , might be proud of him , and the passenger who was entreated to pray for his soul has a wish breathed for his welfare .... The Epitaphs of Chiabrera are twenty-nine in number , and all of them , save two , upon men probably little known at this day in their own country , and scarcely at all beyond the limits of it ; and the reader is generally made acquainted with the moral and intellectual excellence which distinguished them by a brief history of the course of their lives , or a selection of events and circumstances , and thus they are individualized ; but in the two other instances , namely , in those of Tasso and Raphael , he enters into no particulars , but contents himself with four lines expressing one sentiment , upon the principle laid down in the former part of this discourse , when the subject of the epitaph is a man of prime note .... ”</p>
     <p>Compare the poem Musings near Aquapendente . In reference to the places referred to in these Epitaphs of Chiabrera , it may be mentioned that Savona ( Epitaphs III ., IV ., V ., VII ., VIII . ) is a town in the Genovese territory ; Permessus ( Epitaphs V. and IX . ) a river of Boeotia , rising in Mount Helicon and flowing round it , hence sacred to the Muses ; and that the fountain of Hippocrene — also referred to in Epitaph V .— was not far distant . Sebeto ( Epitaph VII . ) , now cape Faro , is a Sicilian promontory .— ED .</p>

     <p>As indicated in the editorial note to the poems belonging to the year 1809 , those of 1810 were mainly sonnets , suggested by the events occurring on the Continent of Europe , and the patriotic efforts of the Spaniards to resist Napoleon . I have assigned the two referring to Flamininus , entitled On a Celebrated Event in Ancient History , to the same year . They were first published in 1815 , and seem to have been due to the same impulse which led Wordsworth to write the “ Sonnets dedicated to Liberty . ” — ED .</p>

     <p>This “ Roman Master ” “ on Grecian ground ” was T. Quintius Flamininus , one of the ablest and noblest of the Roman generals ( 230-174 B. C . ) . He was successful against Philip of Macedon , overran Thessaly in 198 , and conquered the Macedonian army in 197 , defeating Philip at Cynoscephalae . He concluded a peace with the vanquished . “ In the spring of 196 , the Roman commission arrived in Greece to arrange , conjointly with Flamininus , the affairs of the country : they also brought with them the terms on which a definite peace was to be concluded with Philip .... The Aetolians exerted themselves to excite suspicions among the Greeks as to the sincerity of the Romans in their dealings with them . Flamininus , however , insisted upon immediate compliance with the terms of the peace .... In this summer , the Isthmian games were celebrated at Corinth , and thousands from all parts of Greece flocked thither . Flamininus , accompanied by the ten commissioners , entered the assembly , and , at his command , a herald , in name of the Roman Senate , proclaimed the freedom and independence of Greece . The joy and enthusiasm at this unexpected declaration was beyond all description : the throngs of people that crowded around Flamininus to catch a sight of their liberator or touch his garment were so enormous , that even his life was endangered . ” ( Smith 's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography : Art . Flamininus , No . 4 . ) — ED .</p>

     <p>The Aetolians were the only Greeks that entertained suspicion of the Roman designs from the first . When Flamininus was wintering in Phocis in 196 , and an insurrection broke out at Opus , some of the citizens had called in the aid of the Aetolians against the Macedonian garrison ; but the gates of the city were not opened to admit the Aetolian volunteers till Flamininus arrived . Then in the battle at the heights of Cynoscephalae , where the Macedonian army was routed , the Aetolian contingent , which had helped Flamininus , claimed the sole credit of the victory ; and wished no truce made with Philip , as they were bent on the destruction of the Macedonian power . The Aetolians aimed subsequently at exciting suspicion against the sincerity of Flamininus . In the second sonnet , Wordsworth 's sympathy seems to have been with the Aetolians , as much as it was with the Swiss and the Tyrolese in their attitude to Buonaparte . But Flamininus was not a Napoleon .— ED .</p>

     <p>The ancient oak of Guernica , says Laborde in his account of Biscay , is a most venerable natural monument . Ferdinand and Isabella , in the year 1476 , after hearing mass in the church of Santa Maria de la Antigua , repaired to this tree , under which they swore to the Biscayans to maintain their fueros ( privileges ) . What other interest belongs to it in the minds of this people will appear from the following</p>

       <l n="56">To what he saw , he gradually returned ,</l>
       <l n="57">Like a scared Bird encouraged to renew</l>
       <l n="58">A broken intercourse ; and , while his eyes</l>
       <l n="59">Were yet with pensive fear and gentle awe</l>
       <l n="60">Turned upon her who bore him , she would stoop 60</l>
       <l n="61">To imprint a kiss that lacked not power to spread</l>
       <l n="62">Faint colour over both their pallid cheeks ,</l>
       <l n="63">And stilled his tremulous lip . Thus they were calmed</l>

Thomas perpetually forces a tender smile by his simplicity , but Catherine makes you laugh outright , though she can hardly say a dozen words , and she joins in the laugh , as if sensible of the drollery of her appearance . ” — ED .</p>

      <head>EPISTLE TO SIR GEORGE HOWLAND BEAUMONT , BART .</head>
      <head>FROM THE SOUTH-WEST COAST OF CUMBERLAND .— 1811</head>
       <l n="1">Composed 1811 .— Published 1842</l>
     </lg>
     <p>[ This poem opened , when first written , with a paragraph that has been transferred as an introduction to the first series of my Scotch Memorials . The journey , of which the first part is here described , was from Grasmere to Bootle on the south-west coast of Cumberland , the whole among mountain roads through a beautiful country ; and we had fine weather . The verses end with our breakfast at the head of Yewdale in a yeoman 's house , which , like all the other property in that sequestered vale , has passed or is passing into the hands of Mr. James Marshall of Monk Coniston — in Mr. Knott 's , the late owner 's , time called Waterhead . Our hostess married a Mr. Oldfield , a lieutenant in the Navy . They lived together for some time at Hacket , where she still resides as his widow . It was in front of that house , on the mountain side , near which stood the peasant who , while we were passing at a distance , saluted us , waving a kerchief in her hand as described in the poem . [ A ] ( This matron and her husband were then residing at the Hacket . The house and its inmates are referred to in the fifth book of The Excursion , in the passage beginning —</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">You behold ,</l>
       <l n="2">High on the breast of yon dark mountain , dark</l>
       <l n="3">With stony barrenness , a shining speck .— J . C .)[ B ]</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The dog which we met with soon after our starting belonged to Mr. Rowlandson , who for forty years was curate of Grasmere in place of the rector who lived to extreme old age in a state of insanity . Of this Mr. R. much might be said , both with reference to his character , and the way in which he was regarded by his parishioners . He was a man of a robust frame , had a firm voice and authoritative manner , of strong natural talents , of which he was himself conscious , for he has been heard to say ( it grieves me to add ) with an oath — “ If I had been brought up at college I should have been a bishop . ” Two vices used to struggle in him for mastery , avarice and the love of strong drink ; but avarice , as is common in like cases , always got the better of its opponent ; for , though he was often intoxicated , it was never I believe at his own expense . As has been said of one in a more exalted station , he would take any given quantity . I have heard a story of him which is worth the telling . One summer 's morning , our Grasmere curate , after a night 's carouse in the vale of Langdale , on his return home , having reached a point near which the whole of the vale of Grasmere might be seen with the lake immediately below him , stepped aside and sat down on the turf . After looking for some time at the landscape , then in the perfection of its morning beauty , he exclaimed — “ Good God , that I should have led so long such a life in such a place ! ” This no doubt was deeply felt by him at the time , but I am not authorised to say that any noticeable amendment followed . Penuriousness strengthened upon him as his body grew feebler with age . He had purchased property and kept some land in his own hands , but he could not find in his heart to lay out the necessary hire for labourers at the proper season , and consequently he has often been seen in half-dotage working his hay in the month of November by moonlight , a melancholy sight which I myself have witnessed . Notwithstanding all that has been said , this man , on account of his talents and superior education , was looked up to by his parishioners , who without a single exception lived at that time ( and most of them upon their own small inheritances ) in a state of republican equality , a condition favourable to the growth of kindly feelings among them , and in a striking degree exclusive to temptations to gross vice and scandalous behaviour . As a pastor their curate did little or nothing for them ; but what could more strikingly set forth the efficacy of the Church of England through its Ordinances and Liturgy than that , in spite of the unworthiness of the minister , his church was regularly attended ; and , though there was not much appearance in the flock of what might be called animated piety , intoxication was rare , and dissolute morals unknown . With the Bible they were for the most part well acquainted ; and , as was strikingly shown when they were under affliction , must have been supported and comforted by habitual belief in those truths which it is the aim of the Church to inculcate . Loughrigg Tarn .— This beautiful pool and the surrounding scene are minutely described in my little Book upon the Lakes . Sir G. H. Beaumont , in the earlier part of his life , was induced , by his love of nature and the art of painting , to take up his abode at Old Brathay , about three miles from this spot , so that he must have seen it under many aspects ; and he was so much pleased with it that he purchased the Tarn with a view to build , near it , such a residence as is alluded to in this Epistle . Baronets and knights were not so common in that day as now , and Sir Michael le Fleming , not liking to have a rival in that kind of distinction so near him , claimed a sort of Lordship over the territory , and showed dispositions little in unison with those of Sir G. Beaumont , who was eminently a lover of peace . The project of building was in consequence given up , Sir George retaining possession of the Tarn . Many years afterwards a Kendal tradesman born upon its banks applied to me for the purchase of it , and accordingly it was sold for the sum that had been given for it , and the money was laid out under my direction upon a substantial oak fence for a certain number of yew trees to be planted in Grasmere church-yard ; two were planted in each enclosure , with a view to remove , after a certain time , the one which throve least . After several years , the stouter plant being left , the others were taken up and placed in other parts of the same church-yard , and were adequately fenced at the expense and under the care of the late Mr. Barber , Mr. Greenwood , and myself : the whole eight are now thriving , and are already an ornament to a place which , during late years , has lost much of its rustic simplicity by the introduction of iron palisades to fence off family burying-grounds , and by numerous monuments , some of them in very bad taste ; from which this place of burial was in my memory quite free . See the lines in the sixth book of The Excursion beginning — “ Green is the church-yard , beautiful and green . ” The Epistle to which these notes refer , though written so far back as 1804 , [ C ] was carefully revised so late as 1842 , previous to its publication . I am loth to add , that it was never seen by the person to whom it is addressed . So sensible am I of the deficiencies in all that I write , and so far does everything I attempt fall short of what I wish it to be , that even private publication , if such a term may be allowed , requires more resolution than I can command . I have written to give vent to my own mind , and not without hope that , some time or other , kindred minds might benefit by my labours : but I am inclined to believe I should never have ventured to send forth any verses of mine to the world if it had not been done on the pressure of personal occasions . Had I been a rich man , my productions , like this Epistle , the tragedy of The Borderers , etc ., would most likely have been confined to manuscript .— I . F .]</p>

       <l n="28">In a letter written from Bootle to Sir George Beaumont on the 28th</l>
       <l n="29">August 1811 , Wordsworth says :—</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ This is like most others , a bleak and treeless coast , but abounding in corn fields , and with a noble beach , which is delightful either for walking or riding . The Isle of Man is right opposite our window ; and though in this unsettled weather often invisible , its appearance has afforded us great amusement . One afternoon above the whole length of it was stretched a body of clouds , shaped and coloured like a magnificent grove in winter , when whitened with snow and illuminated , by the morning sun , which , having melted the snow in part , has intermingled black masses among the brightness . The whole sky was scattered over with fleecy dark clouds , such as any sunshiny day produces , and which were changing their shapes and positions every moment . But this line of clouds was immovably attached to the island , and manifestly took their shape from the influence of its mountains . There appeared to be just span enough of sky to allow the hand to slide between the top of Snafell , the highest peak in the island , and the base of this glorious forest , in which little change was noticeable for more than the space of half an hour . ”</p>
     <p>In the Fenwick note , Wordsworth tells us that this Epistle was written in 1804 ; and by referring to the note prefixed to the first poem in the “ Memorials of a Tour in Scotland , ” 1803 , ( see vol . ii . p. 377 ) , it will be seen that the lines entitled Departure from the Vale of Grasmere , August , 1803 , beginning —</p>
     <p>The gentlest Shade that walked Elysian plains ,</p>
     <p>were “ not actually written for the occasion , but transplanted from my Epistle to Sir George Beaumont . ”</p>
     <p>It does not follow from this , however , that the lines belong to the year 1803 or 1804 ; because they were not published along with the earlier “ Memorials ” of the Scotch Tour , but appeared for the first time in the edition of 1827 . It is certain that Wordsworth travelled down with his household from the Grasmere Parsonage to Bootle in August 1811 — mainly to get some sea-air for his invalid children — and that he lived there for some time during the autumn of that year . He may have also gone down to the south-west coast of Cumberland in 1804 , and then written a part of the poem ; but we have no direct evidence of this ; and I rather think that the mention of the year 1804 to Miss Fenwick is just another instance in which Wordsworth 's memory failed him while dictating these memoranda . If the poem was not written at different times , but was composed as a whole in 1811 , we may partly account for the date he gave to Miss Fenwick , when we remember that in the year 1827 he transferred a part of it ( viz . the introduction ) to these “ Memorials ” of the Scotch Tour of 1803 .</p>

     <p>Their route would be from Grasmere by Red Bank , over by High Close to Elter Water , by Colwith into Yewdale , on to Waterhead ; then probably , from Coniston over Walna Scar , into Duddondale , and thence to Bootle .</p>

     <p>FOOTNOTES :</p>
     <p>[ A ] LOUGHRIGG TARN , alluded to in the foregoing Epistle , resembles , though much smaller in compass , the Lake Nemi , or Speculum Dianae as it is often called , not only in its clear waters and circular form , and the beauty immediately surrounding it , but also as being overlooked by the eminence of Langdale Pikes as Lake Nemi is by that of Monte Calvo . Since this Epistle was written Loughrigg Tarn has lost much of its beauty by the felling of many natural clumps of wood , relics of the old forest , particularly upon the farm called “ The Oaks ” from the abundance of that tree which grew there .</p>
     <p>It is to be regretted , upon public grounds , that Sir George Beaumont did not carry into effect his intention of constructing here a Summer Retreat in the style I have described ; as his Taste would have set an example how buildings , with all the accommodations modern society requires , might be introduced even into the most secluded parts of this country without injuring their native character . The design was not abandoned from failure of inclination on his part , but in consequence of local untowardnesses which need not be particularised .— W . W. 1842 .</p>

     <p>John Dyer , author of Grongar Hill ( 1726 ) , and The Fleece ( 1757 ) , was born at Aberglasney , in Caermarthenshire , in 1698 , and died in 1758 . Both Akenside and Gray , before Wordsworth 's time , had signalised his merit , in opposition to the dicta of Johnson and Horace Walpole . The passage which Wordsworth quotes is from The Fleece , in which Dyer is referring to his own ancestors , who were weavers , and “ fugitives from superstition 's rage , ” and who brought the art of weaving “ from Devon ” to</p>
     <p>that soft tract Of Cambria , deep-embayed , Dimetian land , By green hills fenced , by ocean 's murmur lulled .</p>
     <p>It will be observed that Wordsworth quotes this last line of Dyer accurately in the edition of 1815 , but changed it in 1827 .</p>
     <p>This sonnet was possibly written before 1811 , as in a letter to Lady Beaumont , dated November 20 , 1811 , he speaks of it as written “ some time ago . ” In that letter Wordsworth writes thus of Dyer :— “ His poem is in several places dry and heavy , but its beauties are innumerable , and of a high order . In point of imagination and purity of style , I am not sure that he is not superior to any writer of verse since the time of Milton . ” He then transcribes his sonnet , and adds — “ In the above is one whole line from The Fleece , and also other expressions . When you read The Fleece , you will recognise them . ” — ED .</p>

The first of them was saddened by domestic losses , which deprived the poet , for a time , of the power of work , and almost of any interest in the labour to which his life was devoted .

     <p>This refers to the marriage of Thomas Hutchinson ( Mrs. Wordsworth 's brother ) to Mary Monkhouse , sister of the Mr. Monkhouse with whom Wordsworth afterwards travelled on the Continent . The marriage took place on November 1 , 1812 . They lived at Nadnorth for eighteen years , and afterwards at Brinsop Court , Herefordshire , for twenty-one years . To their son — the Rev . Thomas Hutchinson of Kimbolton , Leominster , Herefordshire — and to their daughter — Miss Elizabeth Hutchinson of Rock Villa , West Malvern — I am indebted for much information in reference to their uncle and aunts . The portrait of Wordsworth in his forty-seventh year , by Richard Carruthers , is in Mr. Hutchinson 's possession at the Rectory , Kimbolton .— ED .</p>

     <p>The reference is to the rejoicings on the Leipzig victory of the Allied Forces , October 16 to 19 , 1813 . Napoleon crossed the Rhine on the 2nd November , and returned to Paris with the wreck of his army . George III . was English Sovereign ; but , owing to his illness , the Prince of Wales had been appointed Regent , and assumed executive power in January 1811 . The King died at Windsor in 1820 , being eighty-two years of age . He had been entirely blind for some years before his death . The “ twofold night ” referred to in the sonnet is sufficiently obvious .— ED .</p>
