    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="5">On Ludgate Hill , a traveller may see</l>
     <l n="6">John Newcome , Grocer , No . Fifty-three ;</l>
     <l n="7">Now , sober reader , do n't turn up your nose ,</l>
     <l n="8">But profit by the truths I shall disclose .</l>
     <l n="9">The Newcome family , you may believe ,</l>
     <l n="10">Straitways descended from good Madam Eve ;</l>
     <l n="11">Adam , a Newcome , when in Paradise ,</l>
     <l n="12">The wily serpent did Dame Eve entice</l>
     <l n="13">To touch forbidden fruit ; and to his shame ,</l>
     <l n="14">Poor Adam Newcome slily did the same :</l>
     <l n="15">For this , from Paradise they soon were hurl 'd ,</l>
     <l n="16">And thus Cain Newcome came into the World .</l>
     <l n="17">‘ Twould be an endless job were I to trace</l>
     <l n="18">All the descendants of the Newcome race :</l>
     <l n="19">Let it suffice that I curtail my rhymes ,</l>
     <l n="20">To scenes connected with the present Times .</l>
     <l n="21">Widely extended is the Newcome Name ,</l>
     <l n="22">Some scoff 'd for Folly , some renown 'd for Fame ;</l>
     <l n="23">Did we in Foreign Courts but look askance ,</l>
     <l n="24">We find they 've play 'd the very Devil in France .</l>
     <l n="25">Each in his turn assum 'd the Sovereign Sway ,</l>
     <l n="26">‘ Till Boney Newcome drove them all away ;</l>
     <l n="27">Mighty in deeds , his Mighty power evinces ,</l>
     <l n="28">And makes his tribes of Newcomes Kings and Princes .</l>
     <l n="29">Louis to Holland went with State Regalia ,</l>
     <l n="30">And silly Jerome king 'd it at Westphalia :</l>
     <l n="31">Poor foolish Joe went slily into Spain ,</l>
     <l n="32">But Paddy Newcome whipt him out again .</l>
     <l n="33">Ah ! Honey , that 's a Newcome , if you please ,</l>
     <l n="34">Makes Boney tremble in his Thuilleries .</l>
     <l n="35">His fame — but , let me onward with my story ,</l>
     <l n="36">My humble rhymes would only mock his Glory .</l>
     <l n="37">In London Newcomes every where are seen ,</l>
     <l n="38">Newcome 's a Lord , a General , Knight or Dean —</l>
     <l n="39">Newcomes , where'er you go , you 're sure to meet ,</l>
     <l n="40">The Park , the Playhouse , or St. James 's Street .</l>
     <l n="41">Amongst our Quality , you 'll find a few ,</l>
     <l n="42">And Carlton House has got its Newcome too .</l>
     <l n="43">At both the Universities you find ‘ em ,</l>
     <l n="44">But in such numbers that they never mind ‘ em .</l>
     <l n="45">In all Professions , Lawyers , Fiddlers , Bards ,</l>
     <l n="46">Lots in the Line , and many in the Guards .</l>
     <l n="47">This leads me to the subject of my story ,</l>
     <l n="48">Tho ’ first I thought it right to lay before ye ,</l>
     <l n="49">By way of preface , or of introduction ,</l>
     <l n="50">Or , if you please , a smattering of instruction ;</l>
     <l n="51">Go as you will , no matter when , or where ,</l>
     <l n="52">You 're sure to see a Johnny Newcome there .</l>
     <l n="53">Now this same Grocer was a man of weight ,</l>
     <l n="54">Eat turtle soup , and talked of Church and State ,—</l>
     <l n="55">For twenty years had bustled well through life ,</l>
     <l n="56">Blest with one son by Doll his loving Wife :</l>
     <l n="57">The Youth , a lankey , awkward , shuffling Blade ,</l>
     <l n="58">Bred by the old ones to pursue the Trade ,</l>
     <l n="59">School 'd by Mamma , who thought all learning stuff ,</l>
     <l n="60">‘ Young John will have the Cash , and that 's enough . ’</l>
     <l n="61">By Martial ardour fired , John scorn 'd to stop</l>
     <l n="62">And retail sugar in his father 's Shop !</l>
     <l n="63">In spite of Daddy 's wrath , and Mother 's tears ,</l>
     <l n="64">Strutted an Ensign in the Volunteers ;</l>
     <l n="65">But the good souls were quickly reconcil 'd</l>
     <l n="66">In admiration of their darling Child .</l>
     <l n="67">Old Johnny seem 'd afraid he 'd be too rash ,</l>
     <l n="68">But Mother doated on the Sword , and Sash .</l>
     <l n="69">Soon Johnny grew ambitious of renown ,</l>
     <l n="70">And sigh 'd to flourish in some Country Town ;</l>
     <l n="71">In some Militia Corps , at distant Quarters ,</l>
     <l n="72">Act the Lothario with the Wives and Daughters .</l>
     <l n="73">Money , or Interest , never-failing friends ,</l>
     <l n="74">Soon did the job , and Johnny gain 'd his ends .</l>
     <l n="75">Translated then to a Militia Beau ,</l>
     <l n="76">Dear , lively Captain Newcome 's all the go !</l>
     <l n="77">Sports a gay Curricle and pair of Tits ,</l>
     <l n="78">Damns smokey London , and the frowsy Cits ;</l>
     <l n="79">With ardour talks of Marches , Camps , and Fight ;</l>
     <l n="80">Such scenes as these would be his soul 's delight .</l>
     <l n="81">At length , one day , his spirits flush 'd with Wine ,</l>
     <l n="82">Johnny resolved to go into the Line ;</l>
     <l n="83">Writes to Mamma a coaxer to Petition</l>
     <l n="84">She 'd make his Father buy him a Commission .</l>
     <l n="85">The doating Mother dwells with anxious pause ,</l>
     <l n="86">Ere she could send her darling to the Wars .</l>
     <l n="87">But as she 'd ne'er refused him what he wanted ,</l>
     <l n="88">She paid the Cash , and his request was granted :</l>
     <l n="89">Soon now the Official letter made it known</l>
     <l n="90">That Ensign Newcome , Fourth or the King 's Own ,</l>
     <l n="91">Would on receipt immediately go ,</l>
     <l n="92">And quick present himself at the Depot .</l>
     <l n="93">What thrilling tumults in his bosom came</l>
     <l n="94">To see amongst the Regulars his name !</l>
     <l n="95">So dash 'd away in wondrous haste and pother ,</l>
     <l n="96">To take a flying leave of Dad and Mother .</l>
     <l n="97">A soldier bold , now Johnny vaunts and vapours ,</l>
     <l n="98">Anticipates his name in London papers .</l>
     <l n="99">‘ From admiration we cannot refrain ,</l>
     <l n="100">‘ The gallant Ensign Newcome 's going to Spain ;</l>
     <l n="101">‘ To shew our gratitude we do n't dissemble ,</l>
     <l n="102">‘ Heroes like him must make Massena tremble . ’</l>
     <l n="103">Or , should a Battle ease him of his breath ,</l>
     <l n="104">His Name 's recorded in the list of Death ;</l>
     <l n="105">The Mortuum Caput then they thus would fill ,</l>
     <l n="106">‘ Died Ensign Newcome , late of Ludgate Hill —</l>
     <l n="107">‘ Of twenty wounds receiv 'd in an attack ,</l>
     <l n="108">‘ All in his front , he scorn 'd to turn his back .</l>
     <l n="109">‘ This sad event will be a grievous blow , Sir ,</l>
     <l n="110">‘ To Johnny Newcome , Alderman and Grocer . '[ 1 ]</l>
     <l n="111">Young John was well aware to what extent</l>
     <l n="112">To purchase fame a golden guinea went ;</l>
     <l n="113">At all the Shops where characters were sold ,</l>
     <l n="114">He could be made a Hero for his gold ;</l>
     <l n="115">A valiant Hero then at any rate ,</l>
     <l n="116">Our John resolv 'd to be or soon , or late .</l>
     <l n="117">An Order now arriv 'd at the Depot ,</l>
     <l n="118">‘ That Ensign Newcome should to Hilsea go . ’</l>
     <l n="119">Altho ’ John relish 'd not these hasty ways ,</l>
     <l n="120">He bolted off to Hilsea in a chaise ;</l>
     <l n="121">And then a Note was handed to our Spark ,</l>
     <l n="122">‘ That without loss of time he should embark . ’</l>
     <l n="123">‘ Upon my soul , ’ says John , ‘ this is no jest ,</l>
     <l n="124">‘ They wo n't allow a man a little rest . ’</l>
     <l n="125">Boxes and trunks were cramm 'd into a Boat ,</l>
     <l n="126">And Johnny Newcome found himself afloat .</l>
     <l n="127">John star 'd with wonder when he got on Board ,</l>
     <l n="128">To see himself surrounded by the Flood .</l>
     <l n="129">The rapid movements so confused his head ,</l>
     <l n="130">He knew not what he did , nor what he said ;</l>
     <l n="131">Had not his appetite , which never fail 'd him ,</l>
     <l n="132">With certain griping , knawing hints assail 'd him :</l>
     <l n="133">For John to certain forms was true , and steady ,</l>
     <l n="134">So eager ask 'd when dinner would be ready ?</l>
     <l n="135">‘ Dinner<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>I 'll warrant , ’ says a churlish Elf ,</l>
     <l n="136">‘ If you want dinner , pray provide yourself ;</l>
     <l n="137">‘ You 'll get no dinner here , ‘ tis not the fashion ,</l>
     <l n="138">‘ We only find you Cabin , Berth , and Ration ! ’</l>
     <l n="139">‘ Damme , ’ says John , ‘ is this your Transport way ?</l>
     <l n="140">‘ What starve a body ?— rot me if I stay ! ’</l>
     <l n="141">John 's resolution now began to shake ;</l>
     <l n="142">Did he for this his happy home forsake ?</l>
     <l n="143">A brother Sub seeing Johnny so distrest ,</l>
     <l n="144">Said , ‘ Come , Sir , let us council for the best ;</l>
     <l n="145">‘ Money you have no doubt , and as ‘ tis fine</l>
     <l n="146">‘ Let us together go on shore to dine —</l>
     <l n="147">‘ Buy what we want , and send it to the Ship ,</l>
     <l n="148">‘ Nor ask a favour of this Savage Rip . ’</l>
     <l n="149">John liked the offer — shook him by the hand —</l>
     <l n="150">Jump 'd in the Boat , and off they made for Land ;</l>
     <l n="151">Din 'd , drank their Bottle , and in merry glee</l>
     <l n="152">Purchas 'd their Stock , and went next day to Sea .</l>
     <l n="153">But now friend John , when tossing on the Ocean ,</l>
     <l n="154">Felt his poor bowels in a strange commotion ;</l>
     <l n="155">Grew serious , then grew sick , and hung his head ,</l>
     <l n="156">Reach 'd , grunted , groan 'd , and stagger 'd to his bed ;</l>
     <l n="157">A prey to sorrow , sickness , and dejection ,</l>
     <l n="158">Restless he lay , imbitter 'd with reflection —</l>
     <l n="159">Curs 'd his own folly — had he but his will ,</l>
     <l n="160">He 'd sooner retail figs on Ludgate Hill .</l>
     <l n="161">Poor John thus lay , till by propitious blast ,</l>
     <l n="162">The ready Anchor 's in the Tagus cast .</l>
     <l n="163">Now motionless the Ship , the sickness flew ,</l>
     <l n="164">His wondering eyes successive objects drew .</l>
     <l n="165">Saw the proud Tagus in smooth torrent Flow ,</l>
     <l n="166">Greeting fair Lisbon , with its breast of Snow ;</l>
     <l n="167">Saw Churches , Convents , o'er each other rise ,</l>
     <l n="168">With stern devotion tow'ring to the Skies .</l>
     <l n="169">Our youthful Hero now we introduce ,</l>
     <l n="170">Deck 'd off in Uniform , and fiercely spruce ,</l>
     <l n="171">With Hat of Wellington , stuck fore , and aft ,</l>
     <l n="172">And crimson sash tied carelessly abaft .</l>
     <l n="173">Black Stock , Reg'mental Sword , and natty Spurs —</l>
     <l n="174">Without the latter there 's no Hero stirs .</l>
     <l n="175">Spurs<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>to a gallant youth are things of course ,</l>
     <l n="176">To make folks fancy he has got a Horse ;</l>
     <l n="177">But as in this , opinions may divide ,</l>
     <l n="178">Yet all must think the gallant Youth can ride ;</l>
     <l n="179">Thus gay equipt , his bosom proudly swelling ,</l>
     <l n="180">Seeks the Town-Major 's Office , or his Dwelling .</l>
     <l n="181">Now see him strutting through the sultry Streets ,</l>
     <l n="182">Staring with all his eyes , at all he meets ;</l>
     <l n="183">Bald-headed Friars , Ladies , hid in Veils ,</l>
     <l n="184">Postboys with huge cock 'd Hats , and monstrous Tails .</l>
     <l n="185">John thought they seem 'd a motley group of quizzes ,</l>
     <l n="186">With lankey jaws , black brows , and dingy phizzes .</l>
     <l n="187">Now reach 'd the Office , in he boldly bounc 'd ,</l>
     <l n="188">And with erected front himself announc 'd ;</l>
     <l n="189">When a Staff-Officer , with a stately look ,</l>
     <l n="190">A sort of frowning survey of him took :</l>
     <l n="191">‘ Pray who are you ? ’ was pompously demanded :</l>
     <l n="192">‘ I 'm Ensign Newcome , and from England landed . '[ 4 ]</l>
     <l n="193">‘ To Belem go , where orders you 'll receive ;</l>
     <l n="194">‘ Write down your Name , Sir , and then Lisbon leave . ’</l>
     <l n="195">John bolted out , saying ‘ Damme what a Beast ,</l>
     <l n="196">‘ I reckon he 's a General at least :</l>
     <l n="197">‘ O rot this Soldier 's life , the Devil 's in it ,</l>
     <l n="198">‘ They will not let a body rest a minute ;</l>
     <l n="199">‘ I 'm fairly sick of it , and so I 'll tell ‘ em .</l>
     <l n="200">‘ I say , my friend , is this the way to Belem ? ’</l>
     <l n="201">‘ Senhor , ’ with shoulders shrugged , ‘ no , no , intende . '[ 5 ]</l>
     <l n="202">‘ No , in ten day ! if I go there , ’ says John , ‘ the Devil mend me . ’</l>
     <l n="203">A British Soldier , who was near at hand</l>
     <l n="204">Said , ‘ Sir , our Lingo he do n't understand :</l>
     <l n="205">‘'Tis but three Miles , strait forward if you please ,</l>
     <l n="206">‘ There 's no use axing them there Portuguese . ’</l>
     <l n="207">John travell 'd on — but soon he slack 'd his pace ,</l>
     <l n="208">The scorching Sun came full upon his face .</l>
     <l n="209">‘ O d —— n their Climate , here 's a pretty rig ,—</l>
     <l n="210">‘ Curse me if I 'm not sweating like a Pig .</l>
     <l n="211">‘ Could I but once get home , they soon should see ,</l>
     <l n="212">‘ The Devil might have all Portugal for me . ’</l>
     <l n="213">Grumbling and Mopping , John at length contrives ,</l>
     <l n="214">And at the Belem Barracks<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>he arrives .</l>
     <l n="215">But Johnny 's spirit now was softened down ,</l>
     <l n="216">He tremulously ask 'd for Captain Brown ;</l>
     <l n="217">Announc 'd himself once more , and begg 'd to know</l>
     <l n="218">What were his Orders ? where was he to go ?</l>
     <l n="219">The Commandant observing John was heated ,</l>
     <l n="220">Mildly requested that ‘ he would be seated . ’</l>
     <l n="221">John 's spirits had been sinking in the wane ,</l>
     <l n="222">But thus encouraged soon revived again .</l>
     <l n="223">‘ Why really , Sir , this service in the Line ,</l>
     <l n="224">‘ At home we reckon to be monstrous fine ;</l>
     <l n="225">‘ But since I was Gazetted , I 'll declare</l>
     <l n="226">‘ A single moment I 've not had to spare . ’</l>
     <l n="227">The Captain smil 'd to see poor John so sore ,</l>
     <l n="228">And kindly said , ‘ You 'll dine with me at four :</l>
     <l n="229">‘ In the mean time , as things to you are new ,</l>
     <l n="230">‘ The Adjutant will tell you what to do .</l>
     <l n="231">‘ Here , Orderly ! step to the barrack-yard ,</l>
     <l n="232">‘ And say I wish to speak with Mr. Ward .</l>
     <l n="233">‘ But cool yourself , and then your Billet seek ;</l>
     <l n="234">‘ I mean to keep you here at least a Week . ’</l>
     <l n="235">John 's heart was soft — thus taken by surprize ,</l>
     <l n="236">He felt a sort of twinkling in his eyes ;</l>
     <l n="237">He falter 'd , stammer 'd , felt himself distrest ,</l>
     <l n="238">In vain his gratitude would have exprest ;</l>
     <l n="239">When busy , bustling Ward attends his chief ,</l>
     <l n="240">Broke up the conference , to John 's relief .</l>
     <l n="241">Ward introduced , did Johnny kindly greet</l>
     <l n="242">( His was a heart we do not often meet ) ;</l>
     <l n="243">Now arm in arm , they travell 'd down the Stairs ,</l>
     <l n="244">John found his spirits , and forgot his cares .</l>
     <l n="245">Tho ’ truly kind was Ward , yet be it known</l>
     <l n="246">He was himself a Sub in the King 's Own .</l>
     <l n="247">A Billet<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>got , the Serjeant mark 'd the Door ,</l>
     <l n="248">They took a Boat , and brought the Trunks on Shore .</l>
     <l n="249">‘ So now , ’ says Ward , ‘ I always work by rule ,</l>
     <l n="250">‘ The first thing you must purchase is a Mule ;</l>
     <l n="251">‘ And if you 're flush of cash , why then , of course ,</l>
     <l n="252">‘ The next thing you must purchase is a Horse . ’</l>
     <l n="253">‘ A Servant have you got ? ’ John answered , ‘ No . ’</l>
     <l n="254">‘ Well , well , ’ says Ward , ‘ there 's one I think I know ;</l>
     <l n="255">‘ An honest fellow , who ‘ twixt you and me ,</l>
     <l n="256">‘ Is just the sort of Man , you will agree .</l>
     <l n="257">‘ A D —— n 'd good Fellow , but I rather think ,</l>
     <l n="258">‘ He now , and then , will take a drop of drink ;</l>
     <l n="259">‘ But otherwise , good-humour 'd , sharp , and civil ,</l>
     <l n="260">‘ John Bull will drink , but fight like any Devil ;—</l>
     <l n="261">‘ Paddy , and Sawney Scot are just the same —</l>
     <l n="262">‘ Here , Serjeant , tell me what 's the Fellow 's name ?</l>
     <l n="263">‘'Tis Teague O'Connor , him I recommend ,</l>
     <l n="264">‘ He 'll suit you famously , my worthy Friend . ’</l>
     <l n="265">So Teague was then install 'd Valet , and Groom ,</l>
     <l n="266">And sent to set to rights his Master 's Room .</l>
     <l n="267">As dinner-time approach 'd , Ward bid him stay ,</l>
     <l n="268">He 'd home to dress , and take him on his way ;</l>
     <l n="269">And John , rigg 'd out in his Best Coat and Feather ,</l>
     <l n="270">Waited for Ward , and off they went together .</l>
     <l n="271">The Commandant , with every wish to please ,</l>
     <l n="272">Scouted those chilling forms that banish 'd ease ;</l>
     <l n="273">Tho ’ plac 'd in Power , Dignity , and Trust ,</l>
     <l n="274">Was kind to all , and to the Service Just .</l>
     <l n="275">The dinner o'er , the festive glass did flow ,</l>
     <l n="276">John found himself a little queer or so ;</l>
     <l n="277">Felt too , a sort of swimming in his head ,</l>
     <l n="278">So stole away , resolved to go to bed .</l>
     <l n="279">When oft to write a Book we undertake ,</l>
     <l n="280">If from the subject we a circuit make ,</l>

     <l n="286">Mine is a sort of stuffing to my Meat ;</l>
     <l n="287">Something of Foreign matter I must tell ,</l>

     <l n="289">In every Country there are customs known ,</l>
     <l n="290">Which they preserve exclusively their own .<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span></l>
     <l n="291">The Portuguese , by some odd whims infected ,</l>
     <l n="292">Have Cloacina 's temple quite rejected ;</l>
     <l n="293">How they arrange their Worship , we shall know ,</l>
     <l n="294">By the disaster that befel our Beau .</l>
     <l n="295">Our Hero gaily sporting out a Song ,</l>
     <l n="296">And cutting angles as he glid along ,</l>
     <l n="297">Some Damsel , heedlessly , from upper floor ,</l>
     <l n="298">Pandora 's incense on his head did pour .</l>
     <l n="299">Drench 'd , buffeted , he had no time to think ,</l>
     <l n="300">Saluted by a compound of such Stink ;</l>
     <l n="301">Smother 'd all over by the filthy souse ,</l>
     <l n="302">He reach 'd his heart up , ere he reach 'd his House .</l>
     <l n="303">Teague , by his Master 's nasty figure struck ,</l>
     <l n="304">Dryly , ‘ He wished him joy of his good luck ’ ;</l>
     <l n="305">Then seiz 'd a Tub , and with assiduous care ,</l>
     <l n="306">With water wash 'd the ordure from his hair .</l>
     <l n="307">‘ Here , prythee , ease me of my Hat and Coat ;</l>
     <l n="308">‘ O C —— t ! the filthy stuff 's gone down my throat .</l>
     <l n="309">‘ O curse them , and their beastly , D —— n 'd emulsions ;</l>
     <l n="310">‘ O Lord ! my wretched guts are in convulsions !</l>
     <l n="311">‘ Give me a Dram . ‘ Od rot the nasty Vixen ,</l>
     <l n="312">‘ She 's ruined my best Coat , with her d —— n 'd Mixen . ’</l>
     <l n="313">Now scour 'd , and sweeten 'd , Johnny whining said ,</l>
     <l n="314">‘ O Teague , I 'm horrid sick , shew me to Bed . ’</l>
     <l n="315">Teague spread the folded Blanket in a crack ,</l>
     <l n="316">And for a Pillow , placed his own Knapsack .</l>
     <l n="317">Astonished John his Servant 's conduct viewing ,</l>
     <l n="318">In trem'lous accents ask 'd what he was doing ?</l>
     <l n="319">‘ O , no great matter , Sir , ’ replies O'Connor ,</l>
     <l n="320">‘ I 'm making up your Bed , an ’ plase your honour . ’</l>
     <l n="321">‘ A Bed for me ! ’ says John , half chok 'd with rage ,</l>
     <l n="322">Says Teague , ‘ You 'll soundly sleep there , I 'll engage . ’</l>
     <l n="323">Poor John , exhausted now , and sighing deep ,</l>
     <l n="324">In sadness stretch 'd himself , and groan 'd to sleep .</l>
     <l n="325">Scarce had the Sun arose in all his glory ,</l>
     <l n="326">Ere Johnny flew to Ward to tell his story .</l>
     <l n="327">‘ Alas ! dear Ward , ‘ tis fact what now I tell ye ,</l>
     <l n="328">‘ My wretched bones are jumbled to a jelly .</l>
     <l n="329">‘ Then there 's my best Reg'mentals all bedevil 'd</l>
     <l n="330">‘ By that D —— n 'd Stink-pot which at me was levell 'd . ’</l>
     <l n="331">Ward felt an interest in his friend 's behalf ,</l>
     <l n="332">But for his soul could not restrain a laugh .</l>
     <l n="333">So bid him Breakfast , and forget his cares ,</l>
     <l n="334">And then he 'd try to manage his affairs .</l>
     <l n="335">So said , so done . ‘ And now , ’ says honest Ward ,</l>
     <l n="336">‘ If I can n't set you right , it is D —— n 'd hard :</l>
     <l n="337">‘ At B —— ‘ s Hotel you will get ev'ry comfort ,</l>
     <l n="338">‘'Tis true he 'll make you pay a lumping sum for't . ’</l>
     <l n="339">‘ O D —— n the expence , ’ says John , ‘'tis all as well ’ ;</l>
     <l n="340">So sent Teague , Trunks and all , to the Hotel .</l>
     <l n="341">With Teague , John went next day to buy his stud ,</l>
     <l n="342">A Mule<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>for baggage , and a bit of Blood .</l>
     <l n="343">Now see him in the Fair , with anxious face ,</l>
     <l n="344">Trying this Dobbin 's metal , t ’ other 's pace .</l>
     <l n="345">‘ I say , you Whiskers , what do you ask for that ?</l>
     <l n="346">‘ A Horse you call it — much more like a Rat . ’</l>
     <l n="347">‘ Noventa Dollars , Quienza Moidores . ’</l>
     <l n="348">‘ How many Guineas , Mister ?— what a bore he 's ! ’</l>
     <l n="349">‘ No Senhor , no Guineas , no Senhor , no say . ’</l>
     <l n="350">‘ Why how the Devil then am I to pay ? ’</l>
     <l n="351">But getting Dollars , he the Dobbin bought ,</l>
     <l n="352">When something passing , his attention caught .</l>
     <l n="353">‘ Here , stop that Fellow , Teague , do n't let him pass ;</l>
     <l n="354">‘ I say , you Quiz , what ask you for that Ass ? ’</l>
     <l n="355">‘ By Ja — s , Sir , ’ says Teague , ‘ you 're in a wrong Key ,</l>
     <l n="356">‘ It is a thumping Mule , and not a Donkey . ’</l>
     <l n="357">‘ What ! ’ retorts John , ‘ do you think I am a fool ?</l>
     <l n="358">‘ What ! do n't I know a Donkey from a Mule ? ’</l>
     <l n="359">But Teague was right , and so his master found ,</l>
     <l n="360">And for the Beast , John offered Thirty Pound .</l>
     <l n="361">‘ No , ’ says the Owner , ‘ but perhaps you will</l>
     <l n="362">‘ Give Thirty-five , and I will take your Bill . ’</l>
     <l n="363">‘ My Bill , ’ says John , ‘ a match , Sir ; it is done ,</l>
     <l n="364">‘ To touch old Daddy 's pockets , no bad fun . ’</l>
     <l n="365">The Beasts thus bought , by Teague were taken Home ;</l>
     <l n="366">So having time , John thought he 'd take a roam .</l>
     <l n="367">Strolling along , he saw the Portuguese ,</l>
     <l n="368">Instead of hand , return a hugging squeeze .<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span></l>
     <l n="369">What beasts ! thinks John . I 'm very sure no true man</l>
     <l n="370">Would hug a Fellow , as we do loved Woman ;</l>
     <l n="371">In my dear country , Women are delightful —</l>
     <l n="372">None here I 've seen as yet , but what are frightful .</l>
     <l n="373">Now Smith 's Repository<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>came in view ,</l>
     <l n="374">‘ Ah ! ah ! ’ says John , ‘ I 've something there to do . ’</l>
     <l n="375">The stairs he quick ascended with a skip ,</l>
     <l n="376">His eyes were first attracted by a Whip ;</l>
     <l n="377">For John observ 'd a Whip was most essential</l>
     <l n="378">To make a Martial Hero consequential .</l>
     <l n="379">For other matters he would then be jobbing ,</l>
     <l n="380">A bridle , and a saddle for his Dobbin ,—</l>
     <l n="381">Canteens , Pack-saddle , and an oil-skin Cloak ;</l>
     <l n="382">Smith wisely said , ‘ the Rain here is no joke ’ ;</l>
     <l n="383">He then a small Portmanteau did propose :</l>
     <l n="384">‘ That thing , ’ says John , ‘ wo n't hold the half my cloaths . ’</l>
     <l n="385">‘ True , Sir , ’ said Smith , ‘ but you 'll have much to spare ;</l>
     <l n="386">‘ Of Forage you will get but half a share . ’</l>
     <l n="387">Such are the Orders ; you may not have seen ‘ em ;</l>
     <l n="388">Two Subs are but allow 'd one Mule between ‘ em .</l>
     <l n="389">‘ Is that the case ? ’ says John , ‘ then there 's some danger ,</l>
     <l n="390">‘ That my poor Beasts must live upon the Manger .<span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span></l>
     <l n="391">‘ No matter , ‘ gad I 'll keep them while I can ,</l>
     <l n="392">‘ And when I join , I then can change my plan . ’</l>
     <l n="393">So every thing being purchased to his will ,</l>
     <l n="394">He settled all by draft on Ludgate Hill .</l>
     <l n="395">This day to bus'ness he did give up solely ,</l>
     <l n="396">And went to buy his Stock from Cavigole .<span type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span></l>
     <l n="397">‘ Pray , Sir , ’ says John , ‘ do you sell Hams , and Cheese ? ’</l>
     <l n="398">‘ Si Senhor , I do sell all vat you please ;</l>
     <l n="399">‘ Biscuits , &amp; Porter , Tongues , Hollands , &amp; Brandy . ’</l>
     <l n="400">John crack 'd his Whip , and swore ‘ twas all the dandy .</l>
     <l n="401">‘ Tea , Sugar , Salt , and vat of all most nice is ,</l>
     <l n="402">‘ Pickles and Soda , good Segars and Spices . ’</l>
     <l n="403">‘ Well said , my Hearty ! now I 'll tell you what ,</l>
     <l n="404">‘ Pack some of all , but in a separate lot . ’</l>
     <l n="405">John now another Draft on Daddy drew ,</l>
     <l n="406">Gave his address and off to Belem flew .</l>
     <l n="407">His time now pass 'd with pleasure , and delight ,</l>
     <l n="408">Loitering all day , and getting drunk at night .</l>
     <l n="409">In scenes like these , John found the week had past ,</l>
     <l n="410">And to his Reg'ment he must go at last :</l>
     <l n="411">A Route receiv 'd to travel off next Day ,</l>
     <l n="412">And march to Sacavem without delay ;</l>
     <l n="413">And thus by daily journies was to go ,</l>
     <l n="414">Until he reach 'd the Santarem Depot .</l>
     <l n="415">Next morn , on Dobbin , off friend Johnny started ;</l>
     <l n="416">Teague led the Mule , and so they both departed .</l>
     <l n="417">John 's legs from Dobbin nearly scrap 'd the road ,</l>
     <l n="418">The Mule close following , tott'ring ‘ neath its load .</l>
     <l n="419">Poor Teague , esteem 'd by all a hearty fellow ,</l>
     <l n="420">With parting Glass had got a little mellow :</l>
     <l n="421">A trifling failing here I must disclose ,</l>
     <l n="422">Teague swore ‘ twas for the honour of his Nose ,</l>
     <l n="423">Whose lovely size , and colour , to his thinking ,</l>
     <l n="424">Could only be maintained by hearty drinking .</l>
     <l n="425">Heedless he went , unmindful as he past ,</l>
     <l n="426">The poor Mule stumbled , and the load was cast .</l>
     <l n="427">‘ Thunder &amp; Turf ! are those your tricks ? ’ says Teague ,</l>
     <l n="428">‘ What ! tired you Spalpeen , and come but a League ! ’</l>
     <l n="429">John now dismounted , and with horror stood ;</l>
     <l n="430">They 'd told him of Banditti in the Wood .</l>
     <l n="431">‘ O , Teague ! dear Teague ! as we are only two ,</l>
     <l n="432">‘ If the curst thieves should come , what shall we do ? ’</l>
     <l n="433">‘ Thieves ! is it thieves you fear , Sir , G — d confound ‘ em !</l>
     <l n="434">‘ Teague and your Honour surely can surround ‘ em ;</l>
     <l n="435">‘ By Ja — s , I would bodder half a score . ’ }</l>
     <l n="436">This check 'd John 's fears , who now did him implore }</l>
     <l n="437">To get the load upon the Mule once more . }</l>
     <l n="438">The job accomplish 'd , he his Horse bestrode ,</l>
     <l n="439">And then with anxious look pursued his Road .</l>
     <l n="440">As Sacavem came now full right in view ,</l>
     <l n="441">He then enquired of Teague ‘ what he should do ? ’</l>
     <l n="442">‘ You first must to the Jewish bend your pace . ’</l>
     <l n="443">‘ Jewish ! '[ 14 ] says John , ‘ why man , that 's at Duke 's Place . ’</l>
     <l n="444">‘'Tis him that sarves the Billet , ’ Teague replies .</l>
     <l n="445">‘ O , well ! ’ says John , and to the Juis hies .</l>
     <l n="446">The Billet<span type="note_anchor">[ 15 ]</span>got , they travel to explore</l>
     <l n="447">For Rua Sacra , Casa , Number Four .</l>
     <l n="448">The House was found , but wanting Door or Casement ,</l>
     <l n="449">‘ Is this the place ? ’ says John in wild amazement .</l>
     <l n="450">‘ Is it to such D —— n 'd sties as these they send us ?</l>
     <l n="451">‘ A pretty way they treat their Brave Defenders ! ’</l>
     <l n="452">Entering , at length , he saw a squalid Wench ,</l>
     <l n="453">Begrimed with dirt , and luxury of stench ;</l>
     <l n="454">Then , in a filthy room , and almost dark ,</l>
     <l n="455">Three wretched women squatted round a spark .</l>
     <l n="456">With out stretch 'd hand his Billet he presents ,</l>
     <l n="457">And stopp 'd his nose t ’ escape the beastly scents .</l>
     <l n="458">A croaking voice exclaims , ‘ Aqui Senhor ? ’</l>
     <l n="459">‘ A key ! ’ says John , ‘ why , D —— n me , you 've no Door . ’</l>
     <l n="460">Teague , sober grown , now offer 'd his advice ,</l>
     <l n="461">‘ A Soldier , plase your honour , may n't be nice .</l>
     <l n="462">‘ Becase your honour must consider ; as why ,</l>
     <l n="463">‘ There 's a good Roof between us and the Sky :</l>
     <l n="464">‘ I 'll first go out , and steal the Beasts some Food ,</l>
     <l n="465">‘ And then I 'll cook your honour something good . ’</l>
     <l n="466">Alas ! poor John ; he wanted consolation ,</l>
     <l n="467">Wrapp 'd in the misery of meditation ;</l>
     <l n="468">So bolting out in anguish to the Street ,</l>
     <l n="469">A Sign<span type="note_anchor">[ 16 ]</span>suspended did his optics greet ;</l>
     <l n="470">When in he rush 'd , and to a room was led ,</l>
     <l n="471">With Table , Chair , and something like a Bed .</l>
     <l n="472">Now from his Canteen culled sufficient fare ,</l>
     <l n="473">The Brandy swallowed , and forgot his care ,</l>
     <l n="474">In four days ’ time he reach 'd the first Depot ,</l>
     <l n="475">And at the Commandant 's himself did show .</l>
     <l n="476">This was a Hero<span type="note_anchor">[ 17 ]</span>great , who treated Subs</l>
     <l n="477">As little better than a pack of Scrubs .</l>
     <l n="478">Himself from Ranks had risen by his merit ,</l>
     <l n="479">But those advantages did not inherit</l>
     <l n="480">That in the best societies you find</l>

   <p>FOOTNOTES</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>This species of partial puffing is carried too far . It reminds me of something of a similar tendency , that panegerized a young Count who was killed by a + Broad-Wheeled Waggon +.</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>The intention of government was no doubt to consult as much as possible the convenience of the Officers ; but , the arrangement was , and is , shameful , respecting their treatment when embarked and on board Transports . In the first instance , hurried to get on Board , they immediately find they have nothing to expect but a hard berth , the use of the Cabin , and Rations ; no utensils to cook with , or to use ; no person to cook for them ; in short , all must depend on their individual exertion . Conceive a young Lad , without a servant , and with a scanty purse , thus situated , expecting a voyage of a month or six weeks ’ continuance !</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>With respect to the Officers at Lisbon , who were there either on duty , or leave , or otherwise , the variety of their dress became at length so ridiculous that Major-General Peacock was obliged to issue a severe Order , restricting them to the use of the Regimental Great Coat , and Hat , or Cap .</p>
   <p>Lord Wellington , in consequence of the heat of the weather , indulged the Officers in wearing loose Great Coats ; but this was soon followed up with waistcoats of all sorts , and colours , with filagree gold , or silver buttons , and what were called Forage Caps , of all fancies and shapes . They only wanted the appendage of Bells .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>All Officers under the rank of Field-Officer , on landing at Lisbon , were ordered to report themselves at the Town-Major 's Office , and were from thence sent to the Belem Depot , to be disposed of by the Commandant there .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>‘ No intende , ’ in Portuguese , signifies ‘ do n't understand . ’</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>The Barracks at Belem were assigned as a general receptacle for Detachments coming from England , and all recovered Men . Captain Brown , of the 23rd Regiment ( than whom no Officer could have managed the duties of Commandant more properly , reputably , and honourably ) , made the arrangements for the march of Parties to join the Army , apportioned the number of Officers ; and gave them orders , and directions for their conduct . Sometimes he permitted Officers to proceed alone to join their Regiments , but generally they were attached to Parties .</p>
   <p>One general Rout to the Army was established , and the distances so divided , and Depots formed , that the parties could be provisioned every three or four Days ; a Commandant , and Adjutant , with requisite non-commissioned officers , being established at each Depot , together with a Commissariat and an Hospital ; and though last , not , unfortunately , the least necessary , a Provost-Marshal .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>At the commencement of the Campaign on the Peninsula , the Portuguese certainly treated the British Officers in the most generous manner ,— voluntarily and hospitably received them into their Houses , and externally carried their liberality to great excess ; giving up their most elegant Apartments , supplying them with a proportion of Plate , Linen , Fuel , and Wax Candles ; but it is with regret that I am obliged to state that this indulgence and hospitality was , in many instances , scandalously abused , and the most ungentlemanlike , ungrateful , indecent , and ungenerous returns were often made . What was the consequence ? So many complaints were made against the Officers for abusing their Billets , that a General Order was issued , stating the number of rooms each rank was entitled to , and restricting the quantum of Furniture to one Table , one Chair , and one Lamp , and an allowance of Oil for each Apartment , with the use of a Kitchen . The consequence follows , that whatever inconvenience , mortification , rudeness , or inhospitable treatment Officers have since experienced , results from the misconduct ( I hope only comparatively ) of a few . Circumstances in the outset may have imposed a sentiment on the Natives , perhaps rather foreign to their disposition ; but the change of circumstances , and the conduct of our Officers , seem to have left a disposition in the Portuguese to treat us roughly , and to get rid of us altogether .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>The opening of the Odoriferous Sluices generally commences about 9 o'clock P. M. and continues , without intermission , for about two hours , and woe to those unfortunates whose business , or pleasure , leads them forth during this display of Portuguese cleanliness !</p>
   <p>There are certain regulations respecting this filthy outrage , such as requiring those people to call out three times , by way of warning the Foot-passenger of his danger , and the offenders are likewise liable to be called to some sort of reckoning ; but the Laws , and the administration of the Laws , are altogether so defective , that it is very difficult to get redress , in cases in which robbery , or even murder , have been committed . Nay , I this moment see a Villain at large , who , without receiving any offence , but what he chose to consider one , on a young Officer 's looking at a Girl , actually followed him , and struck him from behind with a stick so heavily as to brake his arm . The fellow was taken up , and evidences produced , proving the fact : but he is protected by his master ( a fidalgo , i. e . a gentleman ) , and at this moment insolently stares a British officer in the face .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>It was customary for the British Officers who came to Lisbon for the purpose of joining the army , to provide themselves with a Mule or two , to carry their baggage . The only convenient opportunity to make this purchase was at a sort of fair , held every Tuesday in the lower part of the town . There , Horses , Mules , and Donkies were bought and sold ; and , as in all Markets , the price chiefly depended on the demand . The Portuguese Horse-dealer has all the avidity of an English jockey to pick your pocket , but they are not so au fait at the business . At this Fair , you buy or sell your Animal . The bargain is struck , the Money paid , and the contract is indissoluble .</p>
   <p>English Guineas , at that time , had no attraction . The Dollar , or Moidore , was the medium ; but since the Guineas have been introduced in payment of the Army , the Portuguese seem to appreciate their value .</p>
   <p>It was customary for Officers who wanted Cash to give their Draft on some House in London , &amp; c. &amp; c .; but it was purchasing Money very expensively , giving at the rate of six Shillings and Sixpence for a Dollar that would bring only five Shillings ; thus losing eighteen-pence on every five Shillings .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>The Portuguese greeting each other , embrace ; a practice certainly strange to a Briton , and recollecting the effluvia of garlic , is horribly offensive .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>Messrs. Smith and Co. opened a Warehouse of English goods , where an Officer might suit himself ( paying rather dearly ) with every article of wearing apparel , and furniture for the animals , &amp; c .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span>The scarcity of forage rendered it necessary to curtail the quantity of animals allowed for the use of the army . This fell somewhat hard on Subaltern Officers , who were obliged so to contract their baggage as to deprive themselves of many articles actually necessary to their convenience . That something to wear — something to sleep on — something to eat — and something to cook with — were really necessary for existence ; and only one miserable animal was allowed to carry what was so essential for two Subaltern Officers ; but it was unfortunately the case .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span>Senhor Cavigole , as well as many others , Misters and Senhors , kept shops replete with stores of all sorts , which they sold at a very high price , but with which officers knew they must be supplied ; for the hungry French had deprived the Portuguese of that little they possessed ; and it did happen , and not unfrequently , that divisions had been so scantily supplied with rations , that even a private soldier has been known to give a Dollar for one biscuit , and glad to satisfy his hunger at that enormous rate .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 14 ]</span>The Juis de Fero is the Magistrate . The soldiers contracted the appellation to Jewish .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 15 ]</span>The Subaltern Officers , in the Portuguese service , were taken from very humble situations , and of course are not treated by their countrymen with the distinction and respect which British Officers claim ; consequently , where Quarters or Billets are disposed according to rank , the Portuguese Alfares , or Ensigns , are thrust into any wretched hovel , and , from the ignorance of the country magistrates , the British Subaltern Officers were not unfrequently treated with as little ceremony : many of them were billeted in the most wretched , filthy , miserable dwellings , which among a race of people so excessively nasty in themselves , rendered the officers particularly uncomfortable .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 16 ]</span>Immediately in the vicinity of Lisbon , a person may contrive at the inns , or rather wine houses , to be somewhat better accommodated than at a Subaltern 's billet .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 17 ]</span>No disrespect is intended , but until one can ‘ make a Silk Purse of a Sow 's ear , ’ we must be content to submit to the ‘ insolence of Office . ’</p>

      <l n="1">Now once on their Way we see the Pair ,</l>
      <l n="2">When John , as passing , did around him stare ;</l>
      <l n="3">Though flat the Country , oft he got a peep</l>
      <l n="4">At the smooth Tagus in its mazy sweep ;</l>
      <l n="5">Whose Banks well covered by the richest soil ,</l>
      <l n="6">Yielding abundant Crops , with scanty Toil .</l>
      <l n="7">‘'Tis a fine Country , Teague , one needs must say ,</l>
      <l n="8">‘ But thousands should not tempt me here to stay . ’</l>

      <l n="12">Thus time beguil 'd in social chat was past ,</l>
      <l n="13">When John reflected he 'd not broke his Fast .</l>
      <l n="14">When from the Road a narrow path he took ,</l>
      <l n="15">And gain 'd a Rocky Bank , hard by a Brook .</l>
      <l n="16">For now friend Sol had his meridian got —</l>
      <l n="17">John felt uneasy , ‘ twas so scorching hot .</l>
      <l n="18">With eager look a survey round he made ,</l>
      <l n="19">To take advantage of some friendly Shade .</l>
      <l n="20">Alas ! no friendly Bough would interpose</l>
      <l n="21">A shadow large enough to screen his nose ,</l>
      <l n="22">So , near the spot at which his Dobbins drank ,</l>
      <l n="23">He crept beneath the shelving of the Bank ;</l>
      <l n="24">Whilst Teague , regardless of the Sultry ray ,</l>
      <l n="25">Unpack 'd the load , and let the Dobbins stray :</l>
      <l n="26">Then spread the Breakfast , which , to John 's relief ,</l>
      <l n="27">Proved a good store of Biscuit , Ham , and Beef .</l>
      <l n="28">John , now refresh 'd , still closer in did creep ,</l>
      <l n="29">With Brandy quench 'd his thirst , and fell asleep .</l>
      <l n="30">Teague hearing now his Master snore profound ,</l>
      <l n="31">With great composure squatted on the ground ;</l>
      <l n="32">Then with the Brandy filled the largest Cup —</l>
      <l n="33">‘ Here 's to good luck ! ’ said he , then drank it up .</l>
      <l n="34">Again replenish 'd , down again it goes ,—</l>
      <l n="35">‘ And that 's , ’ said Teague , ‘ in honour of my Nose . ’</l>
      <l n="36">Another filled , Teague thought it mighty clever ,</l>
      <l n="37">Though last , not least , ‘ twas ‘ Ireland for ever . ’</l>
      <l n="38">Then cast a look around , to see all right ,</l>
      <l n="39">Fell on his back , and wish 'd himself good Night .</l>
      <l n="40">When now the Sun had three parts clear 'd his Course ,</l>
      <l n="41">Teague started up , and look 'd for Mule and Horse ;</l>
      <l n="42">Pack 'd up and loaded , and with gentle stroke ,</l>
      <l n="43">Touching his Master 's shoulder , he awoke ;</l>
      <l n="44">‘'Tis time to March , Sir , and more cool the weather . ’</l>
      <l n="45">John was content , so off they went together ;</l>
      <l n="46">Reach 'd Gallega that night ; Punhete next day .</l>
      <l n="47">Poor John knock 'd up , began to curse the Way .</l>
      <l n="48">‘ Such Bl — st — d Roads will make a Fellow crazy ! ’</l>
      <l n="49">‘ O plase you , Sir , ’ said Teague , ‘ do just be asy ;</l>
      <l n="50">‘ By Ja — s ‘ tis a turnpike , let me tell ye ,</l>
      <l n="51">‘ To what you 'll meet with at that Villa Velhe . ’</l>
      <l n="52">John interrupted Teague in his Oration ,</l>
      <l n="53">To know , was not Abrantes the next Station ?</l>
      <l n="54">‘ Faith , and it is , ’ said Teague , ‘ there is no doubt ;</l>
      <l n="55">‘ Is it not mintioned in your Honour 's Route ? ’</l>
      <l n="56">‘ O ! D —— n the Route , ’ said John ; ‘ I want to know ,</l>
      <l n="57">‘ I 'm so curst tired , how far we have to go ! ’</l>
      <l n="58">Abrantes Castle now came full in sight ,</l>
      <l n="59">Much to John 's consolation and delight .</l>
      <l n="60">A T —— r was its Juiz ; as folk say ,</l>
      <l n="61">If not belied , and in the Frenchman 's pay ,</l>
      <l n="62">A Brutish Coxcomb — rough , and most uncivil ,</l>
      <l n="63">Who slily wish 'd our Army at the Devil ;</l>
      <l n="64">On all occasions , it was his delight ,</l>
      <l n="65">On British Officers to vent his spite ;</l>
      <l n="66">Kept John , with Teague and Baggage , at his Door ,</l>
      <l n="67">Kicking their heels for full three hours and more .</l>
      <l n="68">John fumed and fretted — but ‘ twas all in vain ;</l>
      <l n="69">Till tired to death , his Billet did obtain .</l>
      <l n="70">But such a filthy , loathsome , beastly Hut</l>
      <l n="71">Mud walls , Mud floor , besmear 'd with Slime &amp; Smut !</l>
      <l n="72">‘ O L — d ! ’ says John , ‘ pray how shall I contrive ,</l>
      <l n="73">‘ In this D —— n 'd hole , to keep myself alive ? ’</l>
      <l n="74">A half-starved Taylor , vamping up old breeches ,</l>
      <l n="75">Cried , ‘ Viva , Senhor ! ’ and pursu 'd his stitches .</l>
      <l n="76">‘ Viver ! ’ said John , ‘ O G — d confound your “ viver , ”</l>
      <l n="77">‘ This horrid place will put me in a Fever . ’</l>
      <l n="78">Then with Grimaces , Sighs , and Groans , and Shrugs ,</l>
      <l n="79">Explor 'd this den of Lice , and Fleas , and Bugs .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="4">
      <l n="80">It is a fact well known , the Portuguese</l>
      <l n="81">Cherish voluptuously both Lice and Fleas ;</l>
      <l n="82">Some Bramin-like , are influenc 'd by Piety ,</l>
      <l n="83">But mostly for Amusement , and Society ;</l>
      <l n="84">For Females oft in parties will carouse ,</l>
      <l n="85">Scratching each other 's Heads , t ’ entrap a Louse ,</l>
      <l n="86">Whilst on their skins , the Fleas will Skip , &amp; Scramble ,</l>
      <l n="87">And wanton Lice through all their ringlets ramble .</l>
      <l n="88">Not that these Gamesome Merriments we find ,</l>
      <l n="89">As in some Countries , to the Poor confin 'd ;</l>
      <l n="90">Here does their influence undisputed Reign ,</l>
      <l n="91">From Courtly Nobles , to the humble Swain .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="5">
      <l n="92">But to resume , poor John , as it was late ,</l>
      <l n="93">Sadly submitted to his wretched fate ;</l>
      <l n="94">Rejected Food , on Canteens stretch 'd he lay ,</l>
      <l n="95">And sullen watch 'd for the returning Day .</l>
      <l n="96">Teague fed his Animals , then took his Dose ,</l>
      <l n="97">And soon resign 'd himself to his repose .</l>
      <l n="98">Restless poor John now pass 'd the tedious Night ,</l>
      <l n="99">Each minute starting from a greedy Bite ;</l>
      <l n="100">With outstretch 'd neck , his eyes he cast aloof ,</l>
      <l n="101">Reliev 'd at length by Day-light through the Roof ,</l>
      <l n="102">Set Teague to work , and so without delay ,</l>
      <l n="103">Saddled his Dobbins , and went on his way .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="6">
      <l n="104">Now eagerly he sniffed the fragrant Gale ,</l>
      <l n="105">The Tagus crossed , and travell 'd in the Dale .</l>
      <l n="106">Govina , Niza , now left in their Rear ,</l>
      <l n="107">When Dobbin stopped , and bristled up with fear .</l>
      <l n="108">‘ God rot the beast ! ’ says John in some amaze ,</l>
      <l n="109">Rose in his stirrups , and did round him gaze :</l>
      <l n="110">A sight beheld , that gave his nerves a shock ,</l>
      <l n="111">A mangled human Body on the Rock .<span type="note_anchor">[ 18 ]</span></l>
      <l n="112">Transfix 'd , he stared with horror and affright ,</l>
      <l n="113">And roared to hasten Teague with all his might .</l>
      <l n="114">Teague unconcerned , with shrug of nonchalance ,</l>
      <l n="115">Said , ‘ O , by Ja — s ! you 'll ne'er get to France !</l>
      <l n="116">‘ He 's a Frenchman , Master , that lies sprawling ,</l>
      <l n="117">‘ The Wolves have given him a pretty mauling . ’</l>
      <l n="118">‘ What , Teague , ’ said John , who felt another dread ,</l>
      <l n="119">‘ Is't Wolves that have upon this Carcase fed ? ’</l>
      <l n="120">Again with horror did around him peer ;</l>
      <l n="121">‘ Wo n't they attack us , Teague ? ’ they must be near .</l>
      <l n="122">‘ Attack , ’ says Teague , ‘ your honour need not fright ;</l>
      <l n="123">‘ If we were dead , and Travelling here , they might . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="7">
      <l n="124">John tired , and anxious , now began to grumble ,</l>
      <l n="125">The cursed , rugged Road , made Dobbin stumble ;</l>
      <l n="126">Some sad mishap his senses now forebodes ,</l>
      <l n="127">When Teague exclaims , ‘ These are the Devil 's own Roads ! ’</l>
      <l n="128">Now from a Cliff they view 'd a Gulph below ,</l>
      <l n="129">Where Tagus sternly midst the Rocks did flow ,</l>
      <l n="130">A narrow path they follow 'd , jam 'd with stones ,</l>
      <l n="131">John , Dobbin led , and trembled for his bones :</l>
      <l n="132">Scrambling , &amp; straggling , step from Ridge to Ridge ;</l>
      <l n="133">At length , the danger passed , they reach 'd the Bridge .</l>
      <l n="134">Now on their Route we find them each day gaining ,</l>
      <l n="135">But , wearied out , poor Johnny ceas 'd complaining ;</l>
      <l n="136">Grown used to suffer Insolence and Pillage</l>
      <l n="137">In every beastly town and dirty Village ;</l>
      <l n="138">To see Religion made the tool of Knaves ;</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="8">
      <l n="140">As now to Salamanca near John drew ,</l>

    <head>FOOTNOTES</head>
    <head><span type="note_anchor">[ 18 ]</span>It was shocking to behold the number of dead bodies ( chiefly of the French Army ) with which the Highway was crowded .— They were in a horribly disgusting state of Nudity , and half devoured by Wolves , and Birds . The Armies had no time to bury the Dead , and the Inhabitants were either too indolent , or for some other reason neglected to do it . But to such a state of Barbarism had the natives of Portugal and Spain attained , that Boys and Girls have been seen throwing human heads at each other , by way of amusement ; and a little Urchin , ten years old , Servant to an Officer , was heard frequently to boast , after the Battle of Salamanca , of having stolen slily on the wounded Frenchmen , struck them on the head with a Stone , in order , if possible , to kill , for the purpose of plundering them .</head>
     <l n="1"><span type="note_anchor">[ 19 ]</span>The Army , not having tents , were obliged to lay out exposed to the</l>
     <l n="2">Weather .</l>
   </lg>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 20 ]</span>In consequence of the difficulty of transporting Baggage , and from other causes , a Regiment on active Service in the Peninsula , could not keep up a regular Mess , as in England . Each Officer was obliged to manage for himself . They were generally divided in mess-parties of twos and threes . This greatly incommoded the Subaltern Officer : allowed only the carriage of half an Animal , it was not possible to admit , for the purpose of having eatables , any addition to his share of Baggage . The mere Ration was all that could be carried , with a Camp-kettle for culinary purposes . Besides , we must recollect the difficulty of obtaining extra articles , and also the want of Money : so that the bit of Beef , and the portion of Biscuit , was the general fare for at least two-thirds of the Officers , with a small allowance of Ration , Rum , and Wine ( generally execrable stuff ): the prime luxury was a drop of Brandy and a Segar .</p>
   <p>With respect to the article of dress , the contents of a very small Portmanteau was all that could be taken , and , if an Officer wore out , or lost his Regimental Jacket , his great Coat was the substitute . As for waistcoats , they were as fancy directed , but generally black , blue , or green , of either silk or velvet .</p>
   <p>An enormous pair of Mustachios and Whiskers were frequently seen to protrude from the delicate countenances of some of our Bond Street Beaux .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 21 ]</span>For the purpose of getting Liquor , the invincible British Soldier will commit every species of depredation : he will rob a House , plunder a Church , steal from his Comrade , and strip his own Officer in the midst of death and slaughter . Instances are known , and too frequently have they occurred , of Scoundrels having , under pretence of aiding a wounded Officer , rifled and stripped him of his apparel ; and all this was effected before death had sealed his doom — before his gallant spirit , that through Life had led them to victory , or protected them in Retreat , had quitted its earthly Mansion !</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 22 ]</span>In the Portuguese language various meanings are attached to the same term . For instance , ‘ Viva ’ is generally intended for , ‘ How do you do ? ’ ‘ God bless you . ’ — ‘ Rompi ’ is used ‘ to beat , to tear , to scratch , to plunder . ’ — ‘ Patron ’ is ‘ the father of a family , the husband , the master . ’ — ‘ Sparum , ’ ‘ stop , be quiet , be easy , have done . ’ — ‘ Poke , ’ from ‘ poco , ’ ‘ a little , directly , quietly . ’</p>
   <p>The Portuguese driver perfectly resembles the English wagoner ; except that the one is obstinate from stupidity , the other from insolence .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 23 ]</span>It is a general observation , ‘ that One Campaign at St. James 's is more efficacious in the attainment of promotion than half-a-dozen Campaigns in active service . ’ Military observers can easily appreciate the justice of that remark .</p>
   <p>The fact is , that had his Royal Highness , the Commander-in-Chief , the uncontrolled power in the guidance of the Army , Interest and Wealth would give place to Justice , Merit , and Desert .</p>
   <p>I shall take the liberty to relate an anecdote which is of so recent a date , that a reference may be had to it without difficulty . Attached to Lord Wellington 's dispatches , relative to the victory of Vittoria , it pleased the higher powers to subjoin the names of certain Officers , with the promotion honourably granted to them , of course , and in consonance with the recommendation of the noble chiefs — so many Majors to be Lieutenant-Colonels , so many Captains to be Majors .</p>
   <p>Before I allude to this particular circumstance , and one which gives validity to the above ‘ general observations , ’ I beg to be understood , that in being obliged to bring forward this case as one in point , the Officer alluded to is universally esteemed ; he is not only active , but intelligent : he stands high in the estimation of his superiors , for a knowledge of the duties of his profession , as well as zeal , and courage , in their performance .</p>
   <p>This gentleman 's name was not introduced in the above promotion at the Tail of the dispatch . Some time afterwards we saw it in the Gazette , but in another class of name for the Brevet of Lieutenant-Colonel , and bearing date ( I think on account of the action ) the same day , videlicet , that of the 21st June . But we now observe this Officer 's name with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel , his Commission bearing date the 2nd of June , by which he has been promoted ; over whom ? He , a young Major , over Lieutenant-Colonel O'Toole . I have not the honour to be acquainted with that gentleman , but it is generally known that he has been in every action of the last three campaigns . He has been promoted from a Company , to a Majority , and Lieutenant-Colonelcy for his meritorious conduct ; in the last instance , for his gallantry at the Battle of Vittoria .</p>
   <p>The Hussar Brigade came out in 1813 ; and all , I believe , that was ever known of their gallantry , was a little affair of cavalry on the 2nd of June , detailed to Lord Wellington in a flourishing letter from Colonel Grant .</p>

   <p>FOOTNOTES</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 25 ]</span>At the close of the American War , such a number of Officers retired so astonishingly enriched , that it is imagined it excited the jealousy of Government . Hence enquiries and investigations were made ; means were taken to put a stop to such iniquitous practices ; and His Royal Highness , the Commander-in-Chief , has since taken measures to put an effectual termination to such disgraceful conduct .</p>
   <p>I speak from authority when I assert , that when the Peace of 1783 took place , one Military Officer retired to his own Country ( a Sister Kingdom ) with the enormous Sum of L190 , 000 , when the income arising from his Regimental Commission , together with his Staff situation , could not have been equal to L1000 a-year . He was seven years on service in America .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 26 ]</span>It is certainly a gross imposition on the Public , but falls particularly heavy on the Naval and Military departments .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 27 ]</span>The Officer whose gallantry took a praam in Boulogne Harbour , in sight of Buonaparte .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 28 ]</span>We have seen M —— rs of P —— t driving to places , and scrutinizing into matters that did not concern them ; when , had they turned their active powers to the circumstances above mentioned , they at least would have obtained more credit , and perhaps not have subjected themselves to a disgraceful defeat and general contempt .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 29 ]</span>It has been whispered , that strange means were resorted to in order to get at the opinions of men in high rank , respecting the operations on the Peninsula . I own I do not credit the malicious story , but , as Sir John was conversant in state politics , I must leave him to form his own conjectures , and his directing his son to write typically might be defended .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 30 ]</span>A true Bill .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 33 ]</span>Major-General Peacocke , of the Guards .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 34 ]</span>The custom was introduced by H. R. H . the Duke of York , and is as follows : if any Officer , no matter the Rank he may hold , is desirous to pay a dutiful respect to the Commander of the Forces , or may have business to transact with His Royal Highness , he is directed to repair to the Horse-Guards at an early hour , on the day appointed for the Levee , and write down his Name and Rank in a list presented to him . He is then told at what hour the Duke commences his Levee , and according to the situation of the Signatures on the list , he is introduced .</p>

I was foolish enough to expect that high-titled Honourables were of similar opinions , in respect to intimacies and friendships , in common with other folks ; but , to my astonishment and disgust , I then found , as I have frequently since experienced , that the man who could bend in the country to a sociable intimacy — changing his ground , changed his deportment ; that the men with whom I have in the country domesticated — have been admitted to a very familiar intimacy , when I met them in Town seemed to have totally lost sight of me , and returned my salute with a careless insolence , if they condescended to return it at all ; this appeared to me ridiculously capricious , unaccountably foolish . At length an old Friend told me it was the way of the world , and that there was a wonderful difference between the Companions in the Country , and the associate in London . Now I do think this is a fair hint to all Johnny Newcomes , a warning to make up their minds , that , however my Lord or Sir Toby may condescend to an Intimacy in the Country ( which , perhaps , may arise from a selfish principle in these Honourable Worthies ) they must expect the Cut direct in Town .<span type="note_anchor">[ 43 ]</span>Another instance of effect on Memory : how many young Men have we seen in such situations , who have acted like the veriest Simpleton , and by their arrogance , and presumption have excited the contempt of their Equals .<span type="note_anchor">[ 44 ]</span>Her Majesty of Portugal having , unfortunately , a great debility of mind , her Son assum 'd the Government as Regent .<span type="note_anchor">[ 45 ]</span>Priests of every description .

In former days a very useful and entertaining Personage was always an Appendage to the Pageantry of Courts , and in great Families — ( yclept ) a Fool : thro ’ this lively Oracle , Truth reached the ears of the Great : but this wise custom has fallen into disuse , and unfortunately the familiars of the Great are now frequently composed of Naturals . If those in Rank and Dignity enjoyed the advantages in common with the Mass of Mankind , and should then give themselves up to excesses , censure might be just , if that censure came from clean hands .

A German Soldier will sell his Bread to feed his Horse — a British Soldier will sell the Corn to purchase Drink . The German Officer , and Soldier , are superior to the British , for both Officer , and Soldier , in the German Cavalry , know their Duty , and feel a pride in it . It is not a whimsical Uniform , or a monstrous pair of Mustachios , that make the Cavalry Officer : but there seems so much attention now-a-days paid to the external embellishment , that the interior is left to bare Walls — empty Chambers . Even the French Cavalry boasted , ‘ that give them English Horses , and they would drive the British Cavalry from the Field ’ ; and there are folks who are inclined to believe them : then as for Cavalry Generals — I wish there was a School for Generals .<span type="note_anchor">[ 79 ]</span>L —— t G —— ls and M —— r G —— ls commanding divisions .<span type="note_anchor">[ 80 ]</span>Lt. - Gen.

The great brilliant , and persevering exertions of F —— d-M —— l B —— d , and the Officers under him , have been successful , by rendering the P —— se Army efficient in point of Discipline , Activity , and interior Oeconomy .<span type="note_anchor">[ 93 ]</span>F —— d-M —— l B —— d.<span type="note_anchor">[ 94 ]</span>Officers taken from the British and German regiments .<span type="note_anchor">[ 95 ]</span>The H —— r B —— de . Upon our approach to the River Eslar , it was expedient that a Lodgement should be made on the opposite side of that River , to protect the formation of the Pontoon Bridge , for the Army to cross the River ; the Hussar Brigade , supported by the 51st Light Regt . and Light Regiment of Brunswick Oels ( ordered to support the Cavalry ) were ordered to attack , take , and maintain the Village . The River , at all times rapid , by the melting of the Snow , was swollen two feet in depth , and its current raged with increasing velocity : 100 Men of the 51st were advanced , with the advance of the Hussars , and passed at the Ford with safety , but drenched with Water ; the two Corps followed , and it was directed that an Infantry Soldier should hold by the stirrup-leather of a Hussar . Whether it was the anxiety to pass the Ford , or some other cause , such was the press to enter the River , that the Ford was lost , and in one minute were seen Hussars scrambling , their Horses now on a Rock — next minute , plunging over head , the Infantry dragged hanging at the Stirrup , and Horses Tails ; some by a jerk , or kick lost their hold , and were , struggling with the Torrent — others borne by the rapid Current of the Water , sunk , never to rise more ;— others happily cast on bits of Islands . Hussars were seen plunging to get up the Bank , dragging three or four Infantry , half-drowned , so convulsed as to keep their grasp . Men 's Caps , Knapsacks , floating down the Stream : but the attachment of one Infantry Soldier to his Firelock was astonishing — he was seen by an Officer , who rode to the brink of the Rock ; as the Man floated down the stream , supported as he lay on his back , by his Knapsack , the Officer said , ‘ Can you swim ? ’ ‘ No , your honour . ’ ‘ Then throw away your Firelock . ’ ‘ No , your honour ; I 'll bring She to shore with me — I wo n't part with She . ’ Fortunately the current bore Him so near to the Rock , the Officer could reach his Bayonet , and the Man was saved . On this occasion it is not in words to give an adequate idea of the gallant and humane conduct of the Hussars . A Serjeant of the 18th Hussars was heard to exclaim , upon his seeing a very fine young Officer of the 51st struggling for life in the middle of the Torrent , ‘ I 'll be D —— d if the fine Boy shall be drowned , ’ and plunged his Horse into the Stream , and , when he rose above the Water , pressed towards the Officer , caught him by the jacket , and lifted him on Shore .— Many other similar cases happened . During the time of passing the River , indeed , I have every reason to believe the Men of the Hussars that were drowned , on this occasion , died victims to their humanity . And it was admirable to see those gallant Fellows , when landed , and free from the grasp of the poor Infantry Soldiers , spring forward to ascend the Hill with an ardour to attack an Enemy they were instructed to expect would oppose them . I wish it was in my power to have paid a similar compliment , for humane exertion , to an Officer of A —— y .<span type="note_anchor">[ 96 ]</span>The H —— ld T —— ps .— In respect of those fine Regiments , much , very much , should be considered in their favour . Unaccustomed to Foreign service — unaccustomed to any duty but London duty , which Duty there are no Regiments can perform half so ably — distinguished from other Regiments in every respect , particularly in regard to pay and interior convenience , it was hardly fair , and assuredly inconsiderate , calculating the expence , to employ the Life Guards on such service . Barring the absence of proper feeling in a few Officers , who rather too hastily returned Home , no Troops were more distinguished for Discipline , good Conduct , Sobriety , Zeal , and Gallantry , or for their patient , and cheerful submission to privations , and hardships resulting from the nature of the Service , and possibly somewhat increased by their inexperience : and I may observe without any possible risk of contradiction , had the Household Troops been fortunately pitted against the best Cavalry of the Enemy , the result would have given them a Celebrity in arms coequal to a general Character so highly creditable to those Corps .<span type="note_anchor">[ 97 ]</span>F —— d O —— rs , Gold and Silver Sticks in the Court Regalia .<span type="note_anchor">[ 98 ]</span>Ample Stores — of Provision — Forage , also for the Hospitals , and of various other descriptions .<span type="note_anchor">[ 99 ]</span>The pay of the Army is six months in arrear ; the Contingent allowance Ten months . A more than actual sufficiency for the Men during the operations of active Warfare is injurious ; the Soldier should not have wherewith to get drunk with , for that is always the result after the Balances are received , and , until the Money is exhausted , the Soldier is a Clog . The Officers , unfortunately , suffer by the withholding their Pay .<span type="note_anchor">[ 100 ]</span>However formidable the Spanish Armies are on Paper , what we have seen of them in the Field does not entitle them to be ranked with any description of Troops in Europe ; and I even doubt if the Americans would not speak slightingly of them . I will give the Spanish Nation all the credit for obstinacy and jealousy they can wish ; but I for one give them no further : their conduct to their Allies , in many instances , has been unfriendly and suspicious — often Hostile . It may be politic to commend their conduct for Gallant Achievement in the Field ; I of course shall not presume to contradict that : and much may be allowed for a Ragged , Starved , unpaid Host , and of whom the Officers are the first to run away . They have admitted some , but very few British Officers into their service ; but if the selection has proved fortunate , I suppose it will be hereafter made known .<span type="note_anchor">[ 101 ]</span>It was ascertained as fact , that King Joe was so certain of beating the Allied Army , it was his and Gazon 's intention to have attacked ; and Joe had boasted he should beat the Enemy , and had actually prepared a grand Dinner for Lord Wellington and his Officers . They meant to attack on the 22d of June . Joe always travelled with a Suite of Ladies , generally beautiful Women : it is said , there were ten ladies of his private Family with him . Those , with all his Wardrobe , Carriages , and Plunder from Madrid , were taken , and he only escaped with the Clothes on his Back , having lost his Hat . By way of replenishing his Goods and Chattles , he actually stole the Linen , Plate , and Clothes , from every place he stopped at , until he reached the French frontier — and also a Hat from a Priest . The whole Baggage , Money , Artillery , and those of the French Army were taken — Carriages , and Animals , and a great many Ladies . The French Officers said they were so pinched , we did not leave them a Pinch of Snuff .<span type="note_anchor">[ 102 ]</span>Such was the rapidity of the Conflict , and such the nature of the Ground , very few of our Gallant Cavalry were engaged ; wide , deep , and watery Ditches intersected the Country in all directions . Had the ground admitted , our Cavalry must have intercepted Thousands . The French could only take two small Field-pieces with them , which , from the rapidity of the pursuit , fell into the Conqueror 's hands before they reached Pampeluna ; but in their usual depredatious way , they plundered all the Houses , and burned many .<span type="note_anchor">[ 103 ]</span>The Hussars made a gallant charge through the Town , and in their progress attacked , and drove the Enemy 's Cavalry out .<span type="note_anchor">[ 104 ]</span>King Joe , or , as the Spaniards properly style him , the Intruder , was so pressed , he jumped on a horse , lost his Hat , and galloped at full speed out of the Town ; and , as Officers and Men , afterwards taken , assured the Author , he actually threw money to the French Soldiery to let him pass .<span type="note_anchor">[ 105 ]</span>Madame , the Countess Gazon , a charming woman , was taken by the Hussars . Major R —— t 's , 10th Hussars , it is said , had the Gallantry and Honour to protect her : she was allowed to follow her Husband a few Days after .— Part of the Cavalry only passed through the Town , the Army went right and left of it .<span type="note_anchor">[ 106 ]</span>The numerous Carriages of all descriptions , and Tumbrils , so completely blocked the Road , and filled the contiguous Fields , it was difficult to pass ; the Carriages were completely loaded with Baggage , and the miserable Animals pushed into Deep , and Wet Ditches . The four-wheeled Tumbrils were loaded with Ammunition , and Money . It is supposed that those who divided the Spoil were enriched : certainly the Soldiers got Thousands of Dollars and Doubloons . It is said , more Persons than Soldiers shared in the Spoil ; one got L8000 of Doubloons . It is to be lamented that , in consequence of the hurry and confusion , the Money was thus distributed — but it was inevitable ; and the good fortune fell to the lot of many who did not share in the Conflict . Two hundred and five Pieces of Ordnance were taken , and five hundred Tumbrils ; large quantities of Army Stores , and Mules , and Horses , and much inferior Plunder also .— Vittoria is a superior Spanish Town , and situated in a fertile Plain .<span type="note_anchor">[ 107 ]</span>It was considered rather an uncommon instance of good fortune , the Noble L —— d should , on any pretence , have been so unaccountably promoted in the same Gazette , Major and Lieut. - Colonel .<span type="note_anchor">[ 108 ]</span>A Badge of Merit is a most honourable Distinction , as the reward of Merit and Gallant achievement ; but its value is eclipsed from the influence of interest . I should think a Board of Officers should be established to examine into the merits of Officers recommended for such honourable remuneration ; and their fiat should either confirm the claim , or reject it altogether : a Badge of Merit would then be valuable . Indeed , if the power of the Board was extended to decide upon the merits for Brevet Rank , the service would gain by it . It is the value of a thing that makes it desirable . If , in the examination of the merits of an Officer reported to the Board , for honourable distinction , the opinion of the Board should decidedly confirm the claim and right , a Patent should be sent to the Officer , signed and sealed by the President , stating the sentiments of the Board , &amp; c. &amp; c. Such would be an inestimable intimation of his claim to Merit — handing down to Posterity an honourable proof of Family desert . But the conferring either Title , or Badge on men who have lolled away their time in Ease , and Affluence , is ridiculous , and truly absurd . Printed by + T .+ and + A .
