     <l n="2">The Butterfly 's Ball and the Grasshopper 's Feasts</l>
     <l n="3">Excited the spleen of the Birds and the Beasts :</l>
     <l n="4">For their mirth and good cheer — of the Bee was the theme ,</l>
     <l n="5">And the Gnat blew his horn , as he danc 'd in the beam .</l>
     <l n="6">‘ Twas humm 'd by the Beetle , ‘ twas buzz 'd by the Fly ,</l>
     <l n="7">And sung by the myriads that sport through the sky .</l>
     <l n="8">The Quadrupeds listen 'd with sullen displeasure ,</l>
     <l n="9">But the tenants of air were enraged beyond measure .</l>
     <l n="10">The PEACOCK display 'd his bright plumes to the Sun ,</l>
     <l n="11">And , addressing his Mates , thus indignant begun :</l>
     <l n="12">“ Shall we , like domestic , inelegant Fowls , [ p 4 ]</l>
     <l n="13">As unpolished as Geese , and as stupid as Owls ,</l>
     <l n="14">Sit tamely at home , hum drum with our Spouses ,</l>
     <l n="15">While Crickets and Butterflies open their houses ?</l>
     <l n="16">Shall such mean little insects pretend to the fashion ?</l>
     <l n="17">Cousin Turkey-cock , well may you be in a passion !</l>
     <l n="18">If I suffer such insolent airs to prevail ,</l>
     <l n="19">May Juno pluck out all the eyes in my tail ?</l>
     <l n="20">So a Fête I will give , and my taste I 'll display ,</l>
     <l n="21">And send out my cards for St. Valentine 's Day . ”</l>
     <l n="22">— This determin 'd , six fleet Carrier-pigeons went out ,</l>
     <l n="23">To invite all the birds to Sir Argus 's Rout .</l>
     <l n="24">The nest-loving TURTLE-DOVE sent an excuse ;</l>
     <l n="25">DAME PARTLET lay in , as did good Mrs . GOOSE .</l>
     <l n="26">The TURKEY , poor soul ! was confined to the rip :</l>
     <l n="27">For all her young brood had just fail 'd with the pip .</l>
     <l n="28">The PARTRIDGE was ask 'd ; but a Neighbour hard by</l>
     <l n="29">Had engag 'd a snug party to meet in a Pye ;</l>
     <l n="30">And the WHEAT-EAR declin 'd recollecting her Cousins ,</l>
     <l n="31">Last year , to a feast were invited by dozens ,</l>
     <l n="32">But , alas ! they return 'd not ; and she had no taste [ p 5 ]</l>
     <l n="33">To appear in a costume of vine-leaves or paste .</l>
     <l n="34">The WOODCOCK preferr 'd his lone haunt on the moor ;</l>
     <l n="35">And the Traveller , SWALLOW , was still on his tour .</l>
     <l n="36">While the CUCKOO , who should have been one of the guests</l>
     <l n="37">Was rambling on visits to other Birds ’ Nests .</l>

     <l n="40">But the rest all accepted the kind invitation ,</l>
     <l n="41">And much bustle it caused in the plumed creation :</l>
     <l n="42">Such ruffling of feathers , such pruning of coats ;</l>
     <l n="43">Such chirping , such whistling , such clearing of throats ;</l>
     <l n="44">Such polishing bills and such oiling of pinions</l>
     <l n="45">Had never been known in the biped dominions .</l>
     <l n="46">The TAYLOR BIRD offer 'd to make up new clothes</l>
     <l n="47">For all the young Birdlings , who wish 'd to be Beaux :</l>
     <l n="48">He made for the ROBIN a doublet of red ,</l>
     <l n="49">And a new velvet cap for the GOLDFINCH 'S head ;</l>
     <l n="50">He added a plume to the WREN 'S golden crest ,</l>

     <l n="52">While the HALCYON bent over the streamlet to view ,</l>

     <l n="54">Thus adorn 'd , they set off for the Peacock 's abode , [ p 6 ]</l>
     <l n="55">With the Guide INDICATOR , who show 'd them the road :</l>
     <l n="56">From all points of the compass , flock 'd Birds of all feather ;</l>
     <l n="57">And the PARROT can tell who and who were together .</l>
     <l n="58">There was Lord CASSOWARY and General FLAMINGO ,</l>
     <l n="59">And Don PEROQUETO , escap 'd from Domingo ;</l>
     <l n="60">From his high rock built eyrie the EAGLE came forth ,</l>
     <l n="61">And the Duchess of PTARMIGAN flew from the North .</l>
     <l n="62">The GREBE and the EIDER DUCK came up by water ,</l>
     <l n="63">With the SWAN , who brought out the young CYGNET , her daughter .</l>
     <l n="64">From his woodland abode came the PHEASANT to meet</l>
     <l n="65">Two kindred , arrived by the last India fleet ;</l>
     <l n="66">The one , like a Nabob , in habit most splendid ,</l>
     <l n="67">Where gold with each hue of the Rainbow was blended :</l>
     <l n="68">In silver and black , like a fair pensive Maid ,</l>
     <l n="69">Who mourns for her love , was the other array 'd .</l>
     <l n="70">The CHOUGH came from Cornwall , and brought up his Wife ;</l>
     <l n="71">The GROUSE travell 'd south , from his Lairdship in Fife ;</l>
     <l n="72">The BUNTING forsook her soft nest in the reeds , [ p 7 ]</l>
     <l n="73">And the WIDOW-BIRD came , though she still wore her weeds .</l>
     <l n="74">Sir John HERON , of the Lakes , strutted in a grand pas ,</l>
     <l n="75">But no card had been sent to the pilfering DAW ,</l>
     <l n="76">As the Peacock kept up his progenitor 's quarrel ,</l>
     <l n="77">Which Æsop relates , about cast-off apparel ;</l>
     <l n="78">For Birds are like Men in their contests together ,</l>

   <p>NOTES .</p>
   <p>Page 4. l. 15 . The Rip . ] A machine used in poultry-yards , under which it is usual to confine the mother bird with the young brood , till it has acquired strength to follow her . The word is derived from the Saxon , Hrip , meaning a covering , or protection , for the young .</p>
   <p>P. 5. l. 13 . The Taylor Bird ( Motacilla Sutoria ) . ] So called from the singular manner in which it constructs its nest , which is composed of two leaves , sewed together with wonderful skill , by the little taylor , whose bill serves him for a needle , and the fine fibres of leaves furnishes him with a substitute for thread , and by which means he attaches a dead leaf to a living one , growing at the end of a branch . The Taylor Bird is an inhabitant of India .</p>
   <p>P. 5. l. 17 . The Golden-crested Wren ( Motacilla Regulus ) . ] Is the smallest of the British birds ; it takes its name from a circle of gold-coloured feathers , bordered with black , forming an arch above its eyes , which it has the power of raising or depressing : it is a native of every part of Europe , and is also to be found in Asia and America .</p>
   <p>P. 5. l. 19 . Halcyon , or Kingfisher , ( Alcedo-irpedo ) . ] Esteemed the most beautiful of our native birds ; but its form is clumsy , and its bill very disproportionate to its size . It inhabits the banks of rivers and streams , where it will sit for hours , on a projecting branch , watching for its prey . The ancients relate many fabulous stories of this bird , as that of its laying its eggs in the depth of winter , and that during the time of its incubation the weather remains perfectly calm , whence the expression Halcyon Days .</p>
   <p>P. 6. l. 2 . Cuculus Indicator . ] A Bird of the Cuckoo kind , found in the interior parts of Africa ; it has a shrill note , which the Natives answer by a soft whistle ; and the Birds repeating the note , the Natives are thereby conducted to the wild Bee-hives , which this Bird frequents .</p>
   <p>P. 6. l. 5 . Cassowary . ] A large singular bird , found in the Island of Java , in Africa , and the southern parts of India . The head of this bird is armed with a kind of natural helmet , extending from the base of the bill to near half way over the head .</p>
   <p>P. 6. l. 5 . Flamingo Phoenicopterus . ] A bird of the Crane kind , but web-footed , whose plumage is of a bright scarlet ; when standing erect , it measures above six feet , though its body is not larger than that of a goose , and is a native of Africa , Persia , and South America .</p>
   <p>P. 6. l. 8 . Ptarmigan ( Tetrao ) . ] The white grons , or white game , inhabits the Highlands of Scotland and the Western Islands ; it prefers the coldest situations on the highest mountains , where it burrows under the snow . It changes its feathers twice in the year , and about the end of February puts on its summer dress of dusky brown , ash , and orange-coloured feathers ; which it loses in winter for a plumage perfectly white , except a black line between the bill and the eye . The legs and toes are warmly clothed with a thick long coat of soft white feathers .</p>
   <p>P. 6. l. 17 . The Chough ( Corrus Graculus ) . ] This bird , which is about the size of the daw , has a long curved bill , sharp at the point , which , as well as the legs and feet , is of a bright scarlet , contrasting beautifully with its black plumage , which varies as the light falls on it , to a deep purple or violet . Its general haunts are the crevices of high cliffs in Devonshire and Cornwall .</p>
   <p>P. 7. l. 2 . The Widow , or Widah Bird . ] Is a species of bunting , a native of Angola and other parts of Africa . And is remarkable for the feathers of its tail . The two middle ones are about four inches long , and ending in a long thread , the two next are thirteen inches in length , broad and narrowing towards the points , from these proceed another long thread .</p>
   <p>P. 8. l. 6 . Yaffil the Woodpecker ( Picus Viridus ) . ] The name Yaffil is provincial , but is so very expressive of the noise it continually makes , that I have preferred it on that account . It is a beautiful bird , and is sometimes called the English parrot ; the colour of its plumage , green , yellow , and scarlet , giving it some resemblance to that bird .</p>
   <p>P. 8. l. 10 . The Numidian Crane , or Demoiselle . ] From the elegance of its appearance , and its singular carriage , is called the Demoiselle , which means the young Lady ; for this bird walks very gracefully , and sometimes skips and leaps , as though it were trying to dance .</p>
   <p>P. 8. l. 15 . Guillemot ( Colymbus ) . ] A sea bird , of which there are several species numerously spread over the northern world ; from whence they come towards winter to the British shores and remain till they have reared their young : it is sometimes called the foolish Guillemot from his stupidity ; for when their companions are shot one after another , they have so little sense of danger , that they make a small circuit , and then return and settle in the same place , to share the same fate .</p>
   <p>P. 8. l. 17 . Toucan ( Ramphastos ) . ] A native of America , where it builds in the hollows of trees , and sits at the entrance , ready to peck at the monkeys , who often endeavour to destroy and eat the young . It is about the size of a Magpye , but the head large in proportion , to enable it to support its immense bill , which is six inches and a half in length , but extremely thin . It is a mild inoffensive bird , and easily tamed , but cannot endure the cold of our climate ; the feathers of the breast are highly esteemed by the natives .</p>
   <p>P. 8. l. 20 . Cross-bill ( Loxia ) . ] So called because the two mandibles cross each other in different directions : they feed chiefly on the seeds of fir-trees ; the singular construction of their bills being admirably adapted to separate the seeds of the cones . The pips of apples are also a favourite food , and to obtain them , they split the apple with one stroke of their bill ; they are consequently found to be very injurious to orchards . It has been observed that they have been more frequently seen in England since the fir-tree has been generally more planted , than formerly .</p>
   <p>P. 9. l. 8 . Siskin ( Fringilla Spinus ) . ] A migratory bird , which is seen in the Southern parts of England at the time of the barley harvest , and is sometimes called the Barley-bird . It has a pleasing note , and is sold as a singing bird in the London bird-shops by the name of the Aberdevine . The accusation of its flirtation with the Greenfinch , is to be understood as pure scandal , the most prying naturalist never having discovered any particular attachment between them .</p>
   <p>P. 10. l. 9 . Razor bill ( Alea ) . ] A migratory sea-bird which visits the Northern shores in spring , and leaves them in winter ; they lay a single egg on the ledges of the rocks without any nest , and on which it is said to be fixed by a cement .</p>
   <p>P. 10. l. 10 . Spoon-bill ( Platea ) . ] So called from the construction of the bill , which is flat the whole length , but widens towards the end in the form of a spoon or spatula ; and it is equally remarkable in its substance , not being hard like bone , but flexible like whalebone ; they feed on snakes , worms , frogs , and fish , even on shellfish , which they first break with their bills .</p>
   <p>P. 11. l. 3 . The Agami , or Trumpeter , a native of America , remarkable for a singular noise , resembling the instrument from which it takes its name .</p>
   <p>THE END .</p>
