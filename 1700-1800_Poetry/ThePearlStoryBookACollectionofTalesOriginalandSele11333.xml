    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">One evening — it was winter , and the hills and fields were covered with snow , but the moon shone bright on the frosty windows , and the fire was burning cheerfully in the grate ; it was such an evening when one likes to enjoy the pleasures of a song or story . You may imagine yourselves on such an evening seated around the table , something like the knights of old , whose pleasure it was to relate their wonderful deeds of arms , when they returned from the “ Holy Land , ” or from some noble deed of knightly prowess ; but the stories you shall hear are very different from those , as the picture you see before you indicates . They are chiefly stories for children , and are such as relate more particularly to the affections of the heart . They may be “ Fairy Tales , ” or they may be household narratives of facts , such as occur in the every-day life of a child . If the moral be good and pure , and the mind interested and made better , the end is accomplished .</p>

   <head>CHAPTER FIRST .</head>
   <p>ABOUT A YOUNG ENGLISH MUSICIAN , AND HOW HE CAME TO SPEND THE WINTER AT MOUNT CARMEL .</p>
   <p>A great many turtle-doves lived about Mount Carmel , and there were orange-trees and cypresses there , and among these the doves lived all the winter . They had broods early in the year , and towards the end of March , or the beginning of April , they set off like great gentlefolks , to spend “ the season ” near London . All last winter a young English musician , who was very pale and thin , lived with the monks in the monastery on Mount Carmel . He went to Syria because when a child he had loved so to hear his mother read in the Bible about Elijah and Elisha on Mount Carmel . And he used to think then that if ever he was rich , he would go and see all the wonderful places mentioned in the Bible .</p>
   <p>But he never was rich , and yet he came here . He was very pale , and had large and beautiful but sorrowful eyes . He took a violin with him to Mount Carmel ; it was the greatest treasure he had on earth , and he played the most wonderful things on this violin that ever were heard , and everybody who heard it said that he was a great musician . In the winters he suffered very much from the cold and the fogs of England ; so , last summer he saved a little money , and set off with his violin for Syria , and all last winter he lived in the monastery of Mount Carmel , among the grave old monks .</p>
   <p>There was one little old monk , a very old man , who soon grew very fond of him ; he too had been a musician , but he was now almost childish , and had forgotten how to play ; and the brother monks had taken from him his old violin , because they said he made such a noise with it . He cried to part with it , like a child , poor old man !</p>
   <p>The young musician had a little chamber in the monastery , which overlooked the sea ; nobody can think what a beautiful view it had . The sun shone in so warm and pleasant , and a little group of cypresses grew just below the window .</p>

   <p>The young man often and often stood at the window , and looked out upon the sea , and down into the cypress-trees , among the thick branches of which he heard the doves cooing . He loved to hear them coo , and so did the little old monk . One day early in January he saw that the turtle-doves had built a nest just in sight ; he watched the birds taking it by turns to sit on the eggs , and his heart was full of love to them ; they turned up their gentle eyes to him , but they never flew away , for they saw in his mild and sorrowful countenance , that he would not hurt them .</p>
   <p>Beautiful and melancholy music sounded for half of the day down from his window to where the birds sat ; it had a strange charm for the doves , they thought it was some new kind of nightingale come down from heaven . The little old monk sat in his Carmelite frock , with his hands laid together on his knees and his head down on his breast , and listened with his whole soul ; to him too it came as a voice from heaven , and seemed to call him away to a better land ; great tears often fell from his eyes , but they were not sorrowful tears , they were tears of love , tears which were called forth by a feeling of some great happiness which was coming for him , but which he could not rightly understand . He was , as you know , a very old man , the oldest in all the monastery .</p>

   <p>CHAPTER SECOND .</p>
   <p>ABOUT THE KIND OLD MONK AND THE MUSICIAN , AND ABOUT THE TURTLE-DOVES WHO MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW .</p>
   <p>Heavenly music from the young man 's room was heard every day ;— finer and finer it sounded . As early spring came on , he grew very poorly ; the little old monk used to bring him his meals into his chamber , because it tired him to go up and down the long stone staircase to the great eating-room . There never was anybody so kind as the little old monk .</p>
   <p>A pair of young doves were hatched in the nest , and when the sun shone in at the window , the young man used to sit in his dressing-gown , with a pillow in his chair , and look down into the cypress-tree where the turtle-doves ’ nest was ; he would sit for hours and look at them , and many beautiful thoughts passed through his mind as he did so . Never had his heart been so full of love as now . The little old monk used to sit on a low seat before him , waiting for the time when he asked for his violin , which was a great happiness for them both . The musician loved the old monk very much , and often , when he played , he desired to pour bright and comfortable thoughts into his innocent soul .</p>
   <p>It was the end of March ; the turtle-doves were all preparing for their flight to England ; the pair that had built their nest under the musician 's window had a home in some quiet woods in Surrey , where it was delightfully mild and pleasant even in winter , but they never were there in winter , although the wood had the name of Winterdown . It was a lovely wood : broad-leaved arums and primroses , and violets blue and white , covered the ground in spring , and in summer there were hundreds and hundreds of glow-worms , and the old tree-trunks were wreathed with ivy and honeysuckle . It was a very pleasant place , and near to it a poet 's children were born ; they had wandered in its wilds , had gathered its flowers , and admired its glow-worms , and listened to the turtle-doves , when they were very young ; now , however , their home was near London ; they only went to Winterdown about once a year for a great holiday . The old turtle-doves talked about the poet 's children in Winterdown , and the young doves fancied that they lived there always .</p>

   <p>It was now the time for them to set off on their long journey ; the old doves had exercised their young ones , and they were sure that they could perform the journey . Next morning early they were to set off .</p>
   <p>All night there was a light burning in the young musician 's chamber , and towards morning the most heavenly music sounded from the window , which the old monk had opened a little , a very little , for fresh air , because his young friend had complained of the room being close and hot . The sound awoke the doves ; and they listened to what they still thought a glorious bird . The little old man sat with his feeble hands together , and his head raised ; it was the first time for years that he had ever sat so ; the young man played , and there was a heavenly joy in his soul ; he knew not whether he was in heaven or earth ; all his pain was gone . It was a blissful moment ; the next , and all was still in the chamber — wonderfully still . The lamp continued burning , a soft breeze blew in from the half-opened window , and just stirred the little old man 's Carmelite frock , and lifted the young man 's dark locks , but they neither of them moved .</p>
   <p>“ That glorious bird has done his singing for this morning , ” said the old doves ; “ he will now sleep — let us set off ; all our friends and neighbors are off already ; we have a long journey before us . ” The parent doves spread their wings ; they and their elder ones were away , but the younger stayed as if entranced in the nest ; he could think of nothing but the glorious bird that had just been singing : his family wheeled round the cypress , and then returned for him ; they bade him come , for it was late . The sun was rising above the sea , and all the doves of Carmel were ready for flight . The younger dove then spread its wings also for this long journey , bearing with him still the remembrance of that thrilling music which affected him so greatly .</p>
   <p>The turtle-doves went forth on their long journey . The young musician and the little old monk had started before them on one much longer .</p>

    <head>THE RED SHOES .</head>
    <head>BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN , TRANSLATED BY MARY HOWITT .</head>
    <head>CHAPTER FIRST .</head>
     <l n="1">HOW LITTLE KAREN WAS ADOPTED BY A LADY , AND HOW SHE CAME BY HER RED</l>
     <l n="2">SHOES .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>There was once a little girl who was very pretty and delicate , but in the summer she was obliged to run about with bare feet , she was so poor , and in the winter to wear large wooden shoes , which made her little instep quite red , and that looked so dangerous !</p>
   <p>In the middle of the village lived old mother Shoemaker , and she sat and sewed together , as well as she could , a little pair of shoes out of red cloth ; they were very clumsy , but it was a kind thought ,— they were meant for the little girl .</p>
   <p>The little girl was called Karen . On the very day her mother was buried Karen received the red shoes , and wore them for the first time . They were certainly not intended for mourning , but she had no others , and with stockingless feet she followed the poor straw coffin in them to the grave .</p>
   <p>Suddenly an old carriage drove up , and a large old lady sat in it ; she looked at the little girl , felt compassion for her , and then said to the clergyman —</p>
   <p>“ Here , give me that little girl , I will adopt her ! ”</p>
   <p>Karen believed all this happened on account of her red shoes , but the old lady thought they were horrible , and so they were burnt ; but Karen was otherwise nicely clothed , and besides , had a pretty doll charmingly dressed in green .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>KAREN WITH HER DOLL .</p>
   </figure>
   <p>She must now learn to read and sew ; and people said she was a nice little girl ; but the looking-glass said , “ Thou art more than nice , thou art beautiful ! ”</p>
   <p>Now the queen once travelled through the land , and she had a daughter with her , and this little daughter was a princess ; and people streamed to the castle , and Karen was there also , and the little princess stood in her fine white dress , in a window , and let herself be stared at : she had neither a train nor a golden crown , but splendid red morocco shoes . They were certainly far handsomer than those mother Shoemaker had made .</p>
   <p>Nothing in the world can compare with red shoes , thought Karen , and she greatly desired them .</p>
   <p>Now Karen was old enough to be confirmed by the bishop , and that she might be ready to go to the church , the old lady had new clothes made for her , and took her to the rich shoemaker 's in the city to select some shoes . This took place in his store , where stood large glass cases , filled with elegant shoes and brilliant boots . All this looked charming , but the old lady could not see well , and so had no pleasure in looking at them . In the midst of these shoes stood a pair of red ones just like those the little princess had worn . How beautiful they were ! The shoemaker said also that they had been made for the child of a count , but had not fitted .</p>
   <p>“ That must be patent leather , ” said the old lady , “ they shine so . ”</p>
   <p>“ Yes , they shine , ” said Karen , “ and I should be delighted to have them ! ”</p>
   <p>And they were tried on , and fitted her little foot so well that they were bought ; but the old lady knew nothing about their being red , else she would never have allowed Karen to have gone in red shoes to be confirmed . Yet such was the case .</p>
   <p>Everybody looked at her feet ; and when she stepped through the chancel-door on the church pavement , it seemed to her as if the old figures on the tombs — those portraits of old preachers and preachers ’ wives , with stiff ruffs and long black dresses , fixed their eyes on her red shoes . And she thought only of them as the clergyman laid his hand upon her head , and spoke of the holy baptism , of the covenant with God , and how she should now become a true Christian ; and the organ pealed so solemnly , the sweet children 's voices sang , and the old music-directors ; but Karen thought only of her red shoes .</p>
   <p>In the afternoon the old lady heard that the shoes had been red , and she said that it was very wrong of Karen , that it was not at all becoming , and that in future Karen should only go in black shoes to church , even when she should be older .</p>
   <p>The next Sunday there was to be the sacrament , and Karen looked at the black shoes , then looked at the red ones ,— looked at them again , and put on the red shoes .</p>
   <p>The sun shone gloriously ; Karen and the old lady walked along the path through the corn ; it was rather dusty , and their shoes were covered .</p>
   <p>At the church-door stood an old soldier with a crutch , and with a wonderful long beard which was more red than white , and he bowed to the ground and asked the old lady if he might dust her shoes ; and Karen stretched out her little foot .</p>
   <p>“ See ! what beautiful dancing-shoes ! ” said the soldier ; “ sit firm — you dance , ” and he put his hand out towards the soles .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">And the old lady gave the soldier an alms , and went into the church with</l>
     <l n="2">Karen .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And all the people in the church looked at Karen 's red shoes , and all the pictures ; and as Karen knelt before the altar and raised the cup to her lips , she only thought of the red shoes , and they seemed to swim in it ; and she forgot to sing her psalm , and she forgot to pray , “ Our Father , who art in heaven ! ”</p>
   <p>Now all the people went out of the church , and the old lady got into the carriage . Karen raised her foot to get in after her , when the old soldier said —</p>
   <p>“ Look , what beautiful dancing-shoes ! ”</p>
   <p>And Karen could not help dancing a step or two , and when she began , her feet continued to dance ; it was just as if the shoes had power over them . She danced round the church-corner , she could not leave off ; the coachman was obliged to run after and catch hold of her , and he lifted her into the carriage , but her feet continued to dance , so that she trod on the old lady dreadfully . At length she took off the shoes , and then her legs had peace .</p>
   <p>The shoes were placed in a closet at home , but Karen could not help looking at them .</p>
   <p>CHAPTER SECOND .</p>
   <p>KAREN GROWS VAIN OF HER RED SHOES , AND IS FORCED TO DANCE OVER THE FIELDS , ACROSS THE BRIDGES , AND EVERY-WHERE .</p>
   <p>Now the old lady was sick , and it was said that she could not recover . She must be nursed and waited upon , and there was no one whose duty it was so much as Karen 's . But there was to be a great ball , to which Karen was invited . She looked at the old lady , who could not recover ; she looked at the red shoes , and she thought there could be no sin in it . She put on the red shoes ,— she thought she might do that also ; and she went to the ball and began to dance .</p>
   <figure>

   </figure>
   <p>When she went to dance to the right , the shoes would dance to the left ; and when she went to dance up the room , the shoes would dance back again ; and they danced down the steps , into the street , and from there she danced , and danced straight out into the gloomy wood .</p>
   <p>Then it was light up among the trees , and she fancied it must be the moon , for there was a face ; but it was the old soldier with the red beard ; he sat there , nodded his head , and said , “ Look ! what beautiful dancing-shoes ! ”</p>
   <p>Then she was terrified , and wanted to fling off the red shoes , but they clung fast ; and she pulled down her stockings , but the shoes seemed to have grown to her feet ; and she danced , and must dance , over fields and over meadows , in rain and sunshine , by night and day ; but at night it was most fearful .</p>
   <p>She danced over the churchyard , but the dead did not dance ; they had something better to do than to dance . She wished to seat herself on a poor man 's grave , where the bitter tansy grew ; but for her there was neither peace nor rest ; and when she danced towards the open church-door , she saw an angel standing there . He wore long white garments , he had wings which reached from his shoulders to the earth , his countenance was severe and grave , and in his hand he held a sword , broad and glittering .</p>
   <p>“ Dance shalt thou ! ” said he , “ dance in thy red shoes till thou art pale and cold ! Dance shalt thou from door to door ; and where proud , vain children dwell , thou shalt stand and knock , that they may hear thee and tremble ! Dance shalt thou !— ”</p>
   <p>“ Mercy ! ” cried Karen . But she did not hear the angel 's reply , for the shoes carried her through the gate into the fields , across roads and bridges , and she must keep ever dancing .</p>
   <p>One morning she danced past a door she well knew . Within sounded a psalm ; a coffin decked with flowers was borne forth . Then she knew that the old lady was dead , and that she was abandoned by all . She danced , and she was forced to dance through the gloomy night . The shoes carried her over stock and stone ; she was torn till she bled . She danced over the heath till she came to a little house . Here , she knew , dwelt the executioner ; and she tapped with her fingers at the window , and said , “ Come out ! come out ! I cannot come in , for I am forced to dance . ”</p>
   <p>And the executioner said , “ Thou dost not know who I am , I fancy . I strike bad people 's heads off ; and I hear that my axe rings ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Do n't strike my head off ! ” said Karen ; “ then I can n't repent of my sins ! but strike off my feet and the red shoes ! ”</p>
   <p>And then she confessed her entire sin , and the executioner struck off her feet , with the red shoes ; but the shoes danced away with the little feet across the field into the deep wood .</p>

     <l n="1">HOW KAREN TRIED TO GO TO CHURCH AGAIN , HOW SHE PRAYED AND WAS SORRY , AND</l>
     <l n="2">HOW AN ANGEL CAME TO COMFORT HER , AND HOW HAPPY SHE BECAME .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And the executioner carved out little wooden feet for her , and crutches , and taught her the psalms criminals always sing ; and she kissed the hand which had wielded the axe , and went over the heath .</p>
   <p>“ Now I have suffered enough for the red shoes ! ” said she ; “ now I will go into the church , that people may see me ! ” And she hastened towards the church-door ; but when she neared it the red shoes danced before her , and she was terrified , and turned around .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The whole week she was unhappy , and wept many bitter tears ; but when</l>
     <l n="2">Sunday returned , she said —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ Well , now I have struggled enough ! I really believe I am as good as</l>
     <l n="4">many a one who sits in the church , and hold their heads so high ! ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>And away she went boldly ; but she had not got farther than the churchyard-gate , before she saw the red shoes dancing before her , and she was frightened , and turned back , and repented of her sin from her heart .</p>
   <p>And she went to the parsonage , and begged that they would take her into service ; she would be very industrious , she said , and would do every thing she could ; she did not care about the wages , only she wished to have a home , and be with good people ; and the clergyman 's wife was sorry for her , and took her into service ; and she was industrious and thoughtful . She sat still and listened when the clergyman read the Bible in the evening . All the children thought a deal of her ; but when they spoke of dress , and grandeur , and beauty , she shook her head .</p>
   <p>The following Sunday when the family was going to church , they asked her whether she would not go with them ; but she glanced sorrowfully , with tears in her eyes , at her feet . The family went to hear the word of God , but she went alone into her little chamber ; there was only room for a bed and a chair to stand in it ; and here she sat down with her prayer-book ; and whilst she read with a pious mind , the wind bore the strains of the organ towards her , and she raised her tearful eyes to heaven and said , “ Oh God , help me ! ”</p>
   <p>And the sun shone clearly ! And straight before her stood the angel of God in white garments , the same she had seen at the church-door ; but he no longer carried the sharp sword , but in its stead a splendid green spray full of roses , and he touched the ceiling with the spray , and the ceiling rose up high , and where he had touched it there gleamed a golden star . And he touched the walls and they widened out , and she saw the organ which was playing ; she saw the old pictures of the preachers and the preachers ’ wives .</p>
   <p>The congregation sat on cushioned seats , and sang out of their prayer-books . For the church itself had come to the poor girl in her narrow chamber , or else she had come into the church . She sat in the pew with the clergyman 's family , and when they had ended the psalm and looked up , they nodded and said , “ It is right that thou art come ! ”</p>
   <p>“ It was through mercy ! ” she said .</p>
   <p>And the organ pealed , and the children 's voices in the choir sounded sweet and soft . The clear sunshine streamed warmly through the window into the pew where Karen sat . Her heart was so full of sunshine and peace , and joy , that it broke . Her soul flew on the sunshine to God , and there no one asked after the red shoes .</p>
   <p>Hans Christian Andersen is an excellent allegorist , and has very ingeniously woven together a most interesting fabric in this story of Karen , who , I am sure , every child cannot fail to see is a fabulous heroine . And yet there is something so simple and touching in the whole story , from beginning to end , that one can scarcely read it without weeping over her sufferings , and wondering in their hearts at the severity of her punishment .</p>
   <p>In former times there was a real belief in supernatural things among the simple-minded , a belief which , it seems to me , was much more in accordance with the Christian character than the senseless unbelief in every thing which cannot be explained according to natural laws , which is certainly very much the case at the present day among the wise and learned , and much more to be regretted than the credulousness of other days .</p>

   <p>THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP .</p>
   <p>Charley was a little boy , but he knew very well how to pity the poor , because he had a kind heart ; and he knew very well that the poor laborers he saw in the streets were not bad because they were meanly dressed and worked hard : he knew they were men , and had hearts like his father and mother , and when they were dressed their appearance was very respectable , and at church no people were more devout or better mannered .</p>
   <p>One morning — it was winter — the sun shone down from the sky , and melted the snow and ice in the street and on the tops of the houses , so that it came tumbling down upon the sidewalks , and the streets were overflowing with the great flood . Charley was looking out of the window to see it fall , and the people dodge and scamper along to save themselves from the great slides that would have been very dangerous if they had hit any one on the head . He was thinking too of the poor little ragged boys , as they went by , some with matches , some with newspapers , and some with their hats in their hands begging , and he wished in his heart that he could do something to help them all ; but he was but a little boy , and scarcely knew how to take care of himself . As he continued to watch the passers-by , there came along a poor chimney-sweep , with his soot-bag and brush ; his feet were very red , and looked as if they were bitten with the frost , for his shoes only half-covered his poor swollen feet , and he had no stockings on . His blanket that hung over his shoulders was black as the chimney , and his face looked like soot .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>CHIMNEY-SWEEP</p>
   </figure>
   <p>Charley was watching him as he went along crying , “ Sweep , ho ! sweep ! ” when down came one of these great slides right upon his head . He fell flat in a moment , and there he lay as one dead , covered all over with the cold snow and ice . Charley rushed into the street in a moment , and screamed for help , but before he could reach the sweep a good man had raised him up , and was kindly brushing his clothes . He was not much hurt , but severely stunned . Charley took him by the hand and led him into the house , and gave him some dry clothes , and put some stockings and shoes upon his feet , and set before him a warm breakfast besides .</p>
   <p>The poor chimney-sweep wept — for so much kindness had touched his heart , and he sobbed out his thanks as well as he could , and took his leave after receiving some small pieces of silver , which . Charley 's mother gave him to help him in his toil ; for it was a toilsome life he had to lead — that poor sweep ; so young , too . It made Charley very sorry to see his tears , and he sat a long time with his head bent upon his breast , and never spoke one word . At last his mother said —</p>
   <p>“ What troubles you , dear ? Are you thinking of the unfortunate chimney-sweep ? Then learn a lesson of gratitude for your own happy lot , and be humble ; for remember that this poor sweep is as good as you , and perhaps far better in the sight of God , who looks at the heart and not at the outward appearance . See how much he must suffer in his poverty ; he may have feelings attuned in beautiful accord with all things noble and charming in nature . He is really very intelligent-looking . He makes me think of the little boy that ran through the streets of a large city all of one cold winter , and then became a great artist , but he was so poor and inexperienced in the ways of the world , that he had to suffer a long time before his genius was discovered . Some time I will tell you about him , that you may know that true genius and worth may be found among the lowest children of earth , and , like the diamond , they will shine when they are polished . ”</p>

   <p>PLEASANT AMUSEMENTS .</p>
   <p>“ Let us go over our first steps again , ” said Marian to her sister ; “ there is nothing like beginning right . When we learn to dance or to sing , or indeed any thing else , we must be sure to learn our first lesson well , and then we shall be sure to improve ; and dancing is certainly a very useful and pleasing amusement . It is useful because it is a healthy exercise . It is called ‘ the poetry of motion , ’ and I have read that the great philosopher Locke speaks of it as of the greatest importance in the education of young people , and he says it cannot be learned too early . ”</p>
   <p>“ And I think , ” said the mother of these young misses , “ he is very right ; for as we grow older we have more pressing and important uses to perform . Every thing in its own time , my children ; as I have told , you before , dancing , as well as music , is a most delightful accomplishment ; but we must not neglect our other duties for these . ”</p>

    <head>THE YOUNG GLEANER</head>
    <head>A FREE TRANSLATION FROM THE GERMAN .</head>
    <head>CHAPTER FIRST .</head>
     <l n="1">HOW WILLY MEETS THE YOUNG GLEANER IN THE FIELD — HOW HE PITIES HIS</l>
     <l n="2">MISFORTUNES , AND ASSISTS TO FILL HIS BAG WITH CORN .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>One hot day in the harvest-time , a little boy named Willy got leave of his father to go out into the corn-field to watch the reapers bind up the sheaves and load the wagons ; and he gathered the field-flowers , and formed them into wreaths to give to his mother , because she loved them dearly . After running about until he was hot and tired , Willy seated himself under the shade of a tree , to rest and amuse himself with his flowers . The poppies , corn-bottles , and darnel , he tied up into bunches . As he was thus occupied , he saw a poor little ragged boy enter the field , his feet bleeding , and an empty bag slung by a cord around his neck .</p>
   <p>Willy instantly felt sorry for the distressed boy , and went up to him , and asked him kindly what he cried for and what caused his feet to bleed . And he made the boy sit down under the walnut-tree by him , and , by dint of kind inquiries , drew out of him this pitiful story :—</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>“ We are five children , and our father and mother are very poor . I am the eldest , and my father sends me out in the harvest to glean in the corn-fields , for we have no field of our own to reap , and the little money for which father toils so hard is barely enough to procure our daily bread ; but I can fill this bag in a day if I work diligently , and I hope to make a little store against winter , when father is often unemployed , and earning nothing . I went out at daybreak this morning , and had more than half filled my bag , when I had the misfortune to enter the squire 's large corn-field . The corn was all reaped and bound up into sheaves . As there were no other gleaners there , I found a good store of ears on the ground , and should soon have filled my bag , if the squire 's son , who was in the field , had not seen me .</p>
   <p>“ He came close up to me with a stick in his hand , and called me a dirty beggar-boy . But I went on with my gleaning as if I did not hear him , which vexed him so that he set the dog on me . I was very much frightened , and in fear and self-defence took up a handful of earth to throw at him , which so incensed its master , that he came up to me , pulled my bag violently from my neck , emptied all that I had gathered upon the ground , threw the bag in my face , and gave me several hard kicks and blows , and ended it all by setting the great dog upon me again , whose bites you see upon my feet . ”</p>
   <p>“ What a bad boy ! ” cried Willy , “ and did you treat him as he deserved ? ”</p>
   <p>“ No , indeed ; I only begged that he would let me pick up my ears of corn ; but he would not consent , and drove me out of the field , bidding me never enter there again , under pain of a sound drubbing from the workmen , who would be ready enough , for they laughed when they saw the squire 's son ill-treating me . ” Then the poor sorrowful child began to weep afresh .</p>
   <p>“ Do your feet hurt you much , poor boy ? ” asked Willy , in a very sympathizing tone .</p>
   <p>“ Yes , sadly enough , ” was the reply ; “ but I would not mind that at all , if I had not to go home with my bag empty . Father will think that I have been idling all day , and will be angry , and not give me any thing to eat ; and I am very hungry now , for I have had only a small piece of dry bread before I came out this morning . ”</p>
   <p>“ Oh , is that all ? ” rejoined Willy . “ Here , take this , ” said the kind boy , handing him a bun which his mother had given him for his luncheon , “ for I am not hungry , and if I was , I had rather see you eat it than eat it myself . ”</p>
   <p>The poor boy hesitated to take the bun , but yielded to Willy 's kind entreaty , and ate it up very quick .</p>
   <p>Then Willy said , “ Now let us fill the bag , for I am going to help you . ”</p>
   <p>So they went to work where the sheaves had stood before the cart was loaded , and had nearly filled the bag , when Willy heard his father calling to him from under the walnut-tree .</p>
   <p>CHAPTER SECOND .</p>
   <p>HOW THE YOUNG GLEANER WAS MUCH FRIGHTENED , AND HOW HAPPY HE WAS MADE — AND HOW DELIGHTED WILLY WAS IN DOING KIND THINGS TO THE POOR .</p>
   <p>“ I wish you would allow me a few moments , ” answered Willy to his father , “ just to help a poor boy fill his bag from the gleanings of the field . ”</p>
   <figure>

   </figure>
   <p>“ But I want you to go with me to the garden , ” replied his father ; “ there are some pears to be gathered , and I know somebody that is very fond of pears . ”</p>
   <p>“ Yes , I do like them , father — for I suppose you mean me — but to-day I like much better to stay here and help this poor boy . I pity him very much , he has been so cruelly treated by a bad boy . ” Then Willy told his father of the little boy 's adventure in the squire 's field , how the squire 's son had beaten and set the dog upon him , and how the poor boy had cried and suffered with the pain , and the dread of taking home the empty bag .</p>
   <p>The father listened attentively to his son 's tale , and immediately went to the little ragged fellow , who was so busy gathering the fallen ears , that he did not hear him when he approached .</p>
   <p>“ Shall I help you ? ” said the loud voice of the master of the field .</p>
   <p>The child was terrified , and replied , “ Indeed , indeed , I have not touched a single stalk or ear of corn except those which were left on the ground . ”</p>
   <p>“ I believe you , my little fellow , you need not tremble so ; if you were a thief you would not be a gleaner . Come here , my boy . ” He then took him to a sheaf of corn , and filled his bag .</p>
   <p>As soon as this was done , Willy sprung up and flew into his father 's arms , and kissed him , exclaiming , “ Thank you , thank you , dearest father , kindest father ! this is so kind ! ”</p>
   <p>“ May God reward you , ” said the boy , as he went away with tears in his eyes .</p>
   <p>Little Willy was very happy , and expressed his interest in the poor boy several times on their way to the garden .</p>
   <p>“ Why are you so happy , my son ? Is it on account of the ripe apricots , or because you have tasted a different pleasure ? ”</p>
   <p>Willy looked into his father 's face said , “ It is because that poor boy is made happier . ”</p>
   <p>After leaving the garden , he ran to his mother and gave her the flowers he had gathered for her , and related the adventure with the little boy . His mother was very much pleased to find her son possessed so much kindness for the poor , and she promised to assist him in his benevolent feelings , and to allow him in future to look after the poor little stranger , and supply him with clothes , books , and also food for the family , whenever it was necessary for their comfort .</p>
   <p>Willy was never so happy and cheerful as when he was doing good and planning something useful to his poor neighbors and friends , for this was the way he lost sight of his own self-gratification , and grew up to be a worthy and honorable man , respected and beloved by all who knew him ; for through his tender care and benevolence he dried many tears of penury and sorrow .</p>

    <head>TONY THE MILLER 'S SON</head>
    <head>CHAPTER FIRST .</head>
     <l n="1">ABOUT A MILL , AND THE OLD MILLER WHO BECAME TIRED AND SOLD IT TO TONY 'S</l>
     <l n="2">FATHER , AND OF THE ADVICE GIVEN TO THE NEW OCCUPANT .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>For many long years there once stood a solitary mill . It was in a valley between two high mountains . The stream that turned the great wheel was so strong and rapid , that its current never ceased the year through . Even in the hottest summer weather , when all other mills had to stop for want of water , or in the depth of winter , when other mill-streams were frozen over , this same mill could go on , ever working , and never standing still .</p>
   <p>For this reason people brought their grain from far and near , even from the city on the farthest side of the lake which received the waters of the stream .</p>
   <p>Now it came to pass the old miller grew weary of the old mill , and as he had made a handsome fortune by his industry , he determined to sell it and go to the city , there to spend his days in a more social way , and of use to his fellow-men . After having agreed with a purchaser , and received payment , he delivered the key to him with these words —</p>
   <p>“ Friend , you have paid me honorably , and I must give you a bit of good advice into the bargain . You may be visited sometimes by strange persons of very small stature , who will ask favors of you . Follow my counsel , and oblige them in what they request . You will find it for your good in doing so . ” Then the old miller bade him good-by , and went his way .</p>
   <p>The new miller took possession of the place , with his wife and only child , whose name was Tony .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>Now Tony was a good boy , but very fond of playing , and in the winter season nothing delighted him more than to go a skating with the neighbors ’ children .</p>
   <p>This his father was very willing he should do , because he believed it to be useful in strengthening his limbs .</p>
   <p>Here is a picture of Tony skating , but you see he has fallen down flat on his back ; but he never minds trifles , he will be up in a moment .</p>
   <p>Tony 's father was very active , industrious , and exceedingly clever at his business , of a frugal turn , and his wife also a good manager ; no wonder that they soon became prosperous .</p>
   <p>Half a year had passed away without his hearing or seeing any thing of the little people the old miller had mentioned at parting ; but at last , one morning as he was standing outside the mill , a little woman appeared before him so suddenly that he started in surprise . With a small clear voice she spoke .</p>
   <p>“ Good-morning , neighbor . I came to ask you to open your sluice-gates at noon , so that your mill may stop for half an hour . We have had our large wash , and shall empty our tubs , which will cause a flood that might injure your mill . Farewell ! and pray attend to my friendly warning . ”</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>CHAPTER SECOND .</head>
     <l n="1">HOW THE MILLER BEHAVED TO HIS KIND NEIGHBORS , AND ABOUT THE RUSHING</l>
     <l n="2">TORRENT WHICH CAME VERY NEAR DESTROYING THE OLD MILL .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The miller knew not what to think . He had never heard of these neighbors before . He had lately been in the upper valley to cut firewood for the winter season , and had seen no trace of inhabitants in the silent gloomy forest . “ Besides , ” thought he , “ wherever they are , and if they have ever so great a wash , what need is there to stop my mill ? No , no , it will not do , careful neighbor ; there is a great deal of meal to be ground to-day , and we must lose no time . ” He went to work , and forgot the warning .</p>
   <p>At dinner , however , one of his men came in hastily , crying , “ Master ! master ! has not the little water-maid given you notice , as she always did to my old master ? She and her company are having their large wash and have been emptying their water-tubs . Hark ! how the stream roars and rages ! and the wheel turns as if driven by a hurricane ! The sky is clear , there has been no rain , yet look at the rushing torrent . ”</p>
   <p>The miller , alarmed , looked out of the window . His face became red with anger , and he said , “ What did I know about the water-witch , and her abominable washing-day ? Spiteful , mischievous hag ! ”</p>
   <p>In an hour or two the stream resumed its usual course , and subsided to its former level ; but the wheels and works of the mill were damaged , and the miller suffered from the expense of repairs , and from the delay it occasioned .</p>
   <p>After some time the mill went on clacking and grinding corn as well as ever , when one day the miller stood looking at his meadow , thinking to himself , “ The grass looks very green , and the weather is very fine ; this meadow must be mown to-morrow . ”</p>
   <p>As he thus stood and looked , two airy figures like young girls appeared , so transparent that the miller fancied that he could see the grass through them as they floated over it , and a gentle voice said , “ Good day to you , miller ! We beg that thou wilt allow us to dance this evening upon this meadow . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Though much astonished , the miller quickly replied in a cross tone ,</l>
     <l n="2">“ How ! dance upon my meadow ! tread down my grass ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The voice answered “ We will not do thy grass any harm ; we and our friends dance so lightly that we hardly touch the tips , of thy long grass . ”</p>
   <p>The miller replied sharply , “ Why then ask me ? If you do not trample my grass , you may dance all the year round for all me . ”</p>
   <p>“ Thank you , ” replied the airy creature ; “ we only beg , for thy own good , that thou wilt not mow thy grass until a shower of rain has wet it after our dance . Remember this . ”</p>
   <p>They then vanished like a thin vapor .</p>
   <p>“ Foolish people ! ” cried the miller ; “ did I ever hear such nonsense ? Must I put off my hay-making till it rains ? We may not have such fine dry weather again during the summer . I shall send my men to cut it down to-morrow . ” He went back to the mill and gave his orders , but said not a word to anybody about what he had heard and seen . When Tony , the miller 's son , was going to bed that night , he looked out of the window , and cried to his father —</p>
   <p>“ There is a strange man with a lantern in the meadow , full of pale lights , dancing about , sometimes forming a wide circle , now dispersing in all directions , then mingling confusedly together . ”</p>
   <p>And the latter said , “ These can be nothing but jack-o-lanterns , or wandering Willies . They come out of the boggy ground , and are driven about by the winds . Wo to the unlucky traveller who takes them for a guide ! ” After looking at the meadow awhile , they all went to bed .</p>
   <p>Next day the men obeyed the master 's orders , and mowed the grass . The weather was so fine that the hay was made in a few days , and brought safely into the barn . No sooner , however , had the cattle begun to eat of it , than they were all seized with a mortal sickness . In a few weeks the stalls were empty ; and even the sheep and pigs , which had been turned out to graze in the meadow , shared the same fate . The miller stormed and raved , and accused his servants of neglect , and was so ill-humored that his wife and son dared not say a word to him . He set out for the city to find the old miller , to complain to him of his losses . The good old man told him at once that he must have forgotten the warning he gave him at parting , and have disobliged or have been unfriendly in some way towards his little neighbors ; advised him to burn his hay , and to beware in future of showing ill-nature or a disobliging spirit towards the little shadowy people .</p>
   <p>The miller went home and followed this advice , and burned his hay . Then he borrowed money to buy more cattle , which thrived well and were very profitable ; he worked diligently at the mill , and bade his wife be more economical in the kitchen ; but to no poor man or child who ventured to knock at his gate did he open his hand or heart in charity .</p>
   <p>One day a very diminutive man , dressed in brown clothes , with skin of the same color , knocked at the door of the mill and asked for a little fine meal . The miller looked black , and bade him be gone .</p>
   <p>“ I ask only for a little , a very little ; you see my bag will not hold more than a handful or two . ”</p>
   <p>More angry as the brown man continued his entreaty , the miller replied —</p>
   <p>“ I will not give you one atom . ”</p>
   <p>“ Do have a little pity , ” implored the little man ; “ I must have some meal , and I must have it as a gift , or I would pay for it a thousand-fold . ”</p>
   <p>The iron-hearted miller became furious , notwithstanding the little man 's earnest begging , and he loosed the great dog , and sent him to drive him away .</p>
   <p>As the little man was passing the tall garden-hedge , Tony slipped out at the back-door , and crept softly to the hedge , saying —</p>
   <p>“ Wait a minute , and give me your bag . ”</p>
   <p>The little man gave him the bag , and Tony ran to the store-room , where there were several sacks , and filled the man 's bag with the finest and best meal he could find . The man received it with joy , and thanked Tony heartily for his kindness , and said to him , “ If you are ever in distress , and want help , come to the oak spring . ”</p>
   <p>He nodded his head , and Tony saw him take the steep path up the mountains .</p>
   <p>“ Poor little man ! ” said Tony to himself , “ perhaps he has a hungry little child at home , for whom he wants to make some porridge . It was very wrong of me to go and take father 's meal out of the store-room without his knowledge ; yet the little man 's need was so great , and he begged so earnestly , that it would have been a greater injustice not to have taken pity on him . I will go to my mother and ask her to give me less for my breakfast and supper , until the meal is replaced . ”</p>
   <p>Summer was nearly over when one day a water-spout burst in , the upper valley , which caused such a sudden and terrible flood , that the miller and his family had only time to save their lives by flight .</p>
   <p>When the waters had subsided , the miller contrived a hovel in the only corner left standing of the mill ; and here , with his wife and Tony , abode in the extreme of poverty .</p>
   <p>The good boy was grieved for his parents ’ misery , but chiefly for his poor mother , who was now unable to leave her wretched bed of moss and leaves .</p>
   <p>Two goats had escaped the general destruction . These Tony took care of , and drove them out to feed upon the mountains every day . Having set out with them one morning , he took the same hill-path by which the brown man had gone , until he came to a large oak-tree , under whose roots he perceived a cave , which appeared to have been hollowed out by a spring . At the entrance Tony sat down beneath the tree , and suffered his goats to browse and skip about at pleasure .</p>
   <p>“ Oh ! ” said he , “ if father only was more cheerful and mother quite well , all would be right , and although we have no mill , and only dry bread and goats ’ milk , I should be quite content . ”</p>
   <p>With these thoughts in his head he fell asleep . He had not slept long before he heard his name called , and on opening his eyes he saw far into the cave , and at its entrance stood the little brown man , who , nodding kindly , said —</p>
   <p>“ Art thou come at last ? I will show thee my house and garden , which will , I am sure , please thee . ”</p>
   <p>Tony followed the little brown man , and after going on a long way , they came to a passage lined with smooth stone . As they proceeded the light became stronger , and they next entered another , the walls of which were formed of large iron plates . Passing through this they reached another lined with bright sheets of copper , which led to a large hall with a roof and pillars of burnished silver . From this hall a pair of folding-doors gave access to a splendid room , with walls , roof , and floor of solid gold , and windows of transparent crystal . The next room was covered with red rubies , having windows formed of large diamonds .</p>
   <p>Tony was led from one chamber to another , all glittering with precious stones , sapphires , topazes , emeralds , and amethysts . Last of all they came to a vestibule , with a dome , and pillars of the brightest polished steel .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>“ My brothers will rejoice to see you , ” said the little man . “ Come into the garden . ”</p>
   <p>It was enclosed with a fence of silver wire , curiously wrought , and the flowers were beautiful beyond description . The trees too were loaded with fruit equally new to him .</p>
   <p>In one part of the garden a number of children were playing . They piled up heaps of pebbles , jumped over them , and laughed heartily if one did not spring clear over , or tumbled down . When Tony came near they cried out , “ Welcome , Tony ! ” and shook his hand , and looked kindly in his face , gathered some fruit , and led him to the other side of the garden , where there was a grove of trees which bore gold and silver fruit . These trees looked just like those the angels bring to children on Christmas-eve . The children shook the trees , and the fruit fell off till the ground was all covered ; then they gathered it up and offered Tony an equal share with themselves , and gave him a diamond needle , and instructed him to string them into a necklace , and threw it over his shoulders . Then they presented him with a sweet orange for his mother , and a pomegranate for his father , which they said must be opened very carefully . “ He will know what use to make of its contents , ” continued they . “ Tell him we send it as a recompense for the meal which thou gavest us out of his store . ”</p>
   <p>Tony modestly inquired if he might keep the necklace . They replied , that it was given him to do as he pleased with ; but Tony thought it would make his father and mother rich again , so he resolved in his heart that he would give it to them .</p>
   <p>Then he took leave of his kind little friends , and his conductor led him back through the passages to the entrance , and bade him farewell .</p>
   <p>When Tony reached home his mother asked him where he had been , for , said she , “ We have been seeking thee these three days , and thy father is gone out once more , almost in despair of ever finding thee . But come here , Tony , and let me see those shining things upon thy neck . ”</p>
   <p>Just then his father entered . “ Ah ! Tony , where hast thou been , my boy ? I thought thee lost to us forever . ”</p>
   <p>Tony looked at his parents and then at the shining necklace , which he had almost forgotten , and thought , “ Then it is not all a dream ! Dear father , I have been with the little brown men of the mountain , and they gave me these shining stones , and here is a present for you , ” taking the pomegranate from his pocket ; “ you will know how to use it ; and this is for you , dear mother , ” handing her the orange . His mother received and ate it with a great relish . Not so the father ; he examined it with suspicion , and asked who this little brown man was .</p>
   <p>“ Why , do n't you remember , father , the little man who came to the mill and begged some meal ? You would not give him any , and drove him away , but I was so sorry for him , that I filled his bag out of the finest we had in the store-house , and told mother about it , and if I did wrong I am very sorry . ”</p>
   <p>“ And does the brown man send me this as a present ? ” said the conscience-stricken father , almost dropping the fruit upon the ground ; “ there may be something hidden in it to destroy me . ”</p>
   <p>“ Oh , no , father ! they are too good to take revenge ; they are all love and kindness , depend upon it . They send you this present for your good , I am sure . Pray do open it . ”</p>
   <p>“ Yes , indeed , ” said the wife , “ I know it will bring in good fortune ; I feel better , much better , since I ate the orange . ”</p>
   <p>“ Well then , I will open the fruit , ” said the husband . As he spoke he broke the rind , when there rolled out upon the floor a large number of polished diamonds .</p>
   <p>Now the miller was able to rebuild his mill and do a great deal of good to the poor , and was once more a rich and thriving man ; no longer hard-hearted , but kind and benevolent . Not a poor family was to be found , for to all who wanted he gave employment , thereby giving happiness to all .</p>
   <p>Tony had been taught to read in his early childhood , and might have been often seen , before the acquaintance with the little brown neighbors , sitting in front of his father 's cottage , reading . Among his amusements now , he was frequently engaged in taking some of the children of the neighborhood to ride in his neat little chaise , with his beautiful striped horse .</p>

   <p>He had now become older , and as he was fond of learning he was put to the best schools , and grew up to be a man having the true love of man in his heart , and happy to share the bounties of Providence with all that were in need ; and he was blessed with more happiness than generally falls to the lot of men at this day .</p>
