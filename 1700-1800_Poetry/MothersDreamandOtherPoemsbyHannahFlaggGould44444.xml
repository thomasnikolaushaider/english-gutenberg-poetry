    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Half our sorrows , half our troubles ,</l>
     <l n="2">Making head and heart to ache ,</l>
     <l n="3">Are the fruit of blowing bubbles ,</l>
     <l n="4">Bright to view , but quick to break .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">All have played the child imbecile ,</l>
     <l n="6">Breathing hard to swell the sides</l>
     <l n="7">Of a shining , fluid vessel ,</l>
     <l n="8">Frailer than the air it rides .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">From the infant 's cradle rising ,</l>
     <l n="10">All the bubble mania show ,</l>
     <l n="11">Oft our richest wealth comprising</l>
     <l n="12">In the bubbles that we blow .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">Brilliant , buoyant , upward going ,</l>
     <l n="14">Pleased , we mark them in their flight ,</l>
     <l n="15">Every hue of iris showing ,</l>
     <l n="16">As they glance along the light .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Little castles , high and airy ,</l>
     <l n="18">With their crystal walls so thin ,</l>
     <l n="19">Each presents the wicked fairy ,</l>
     <l n="20">Vanity , enthroned within !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">But when two have struck together ,</l>
     <l n="22">What of either do we find ?</l>
     <l n="23">Not so much as one gay feather</l>
     <l n="24">Flying Hope has left behind !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">Still the world are busy , blowing ,</l>
     <l n="26">Every one , some empty ball ;</l>
     <l n="27">So the seeds of mischief sowing ,</l>
     <l n="28">Where , to burst , the bubbles fall .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">Nor for self alone to gather ,</l>
     <l n="30">Is our evil harvest found ;</l>
     <l n="31">Oft , with pipe and cup , we rather</l>
     <l n="32">Step upon our neighbor 's ground .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">Thus , amusing one another ,</l>
     <l n="34">While the glistening playthings rise ,</l>
     <l n="35">We may doom a friend or brother</l>
     <l n="36">To a life of care and sighs .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">Do you doubt my simple story ?</l>
     <l n="38">I can point a thousand ways</l>
     <l n="39">Where this bubble-making glory</l>
     <l n="40">Has in darkness hid its rays !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="41">Yet we ‘ ll spare a slight confusion</l>
     <l n="42">Caused the world by giving names ;</l>
     <l n="43">Since a right to some delusion</l>
     <l n="44">Every one from nature claims !</l>

    <head>INFANT FAITH .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Radiant with his spirit 's light</l>
     <l n="2">Was the little beauteous child ,</l>
     <l n="3">Sporting round a fountain bright ,</l>
     <l n="4">Playing through the flowerets wild .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Where they grow he lightly stepped ,</l>
     <l n="6">Cautious not a leaf to crush ;</l>
     <l n="7">Then about the fount he leaped ,</l>
     <l n="8">Shouting at its merry gush .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">While the sparkling waters welled ,</l>
     <l n="10">Laughing as they bubbled up ,</l>
     <l n="11">In his lily hands he held ,</l>
     <l n="12">Closely clasped , a silver cup .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">Now he put it forth to fill ;</l>
     <l n="14">Then he bore it to the flowers ,</l>
     <l n="15">Through his fingers there to spill</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">“ Open , pretty buds , ” said he ,</l>
     <l n="18">“ Open to the air and sun ;</l>

     <l n="21">“ Yes , you will , you will , I know ,</l>
     <l n="22">For the drink I give you now ,</l>
     <l n="23">Burst your little cups , and blow ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">“ Oh ! I wish I could but see</l>
     <l n="26">How God 's finger touches you ,</l>
     <l n="27">When your sides unclasp , and free ,</l>

     <l n="29">“ I would watch you all the night ,</l>

     <l n="33">“ Now remember ! I shall come</l>
     <l n="34">In the morning from my bed ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">To his buds he hastened out ,</l>
     <l n="38">At the dewy morning hour ,</l>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>PATTY PROUD .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The figure before you is Miss Patty Proud :</l>
     <l n="2">Her feelings are lowery , her frown like a cloud ;</l>
     <l n="3">Because proud Miss Patty can hardly endure</l>
     <l n="4">To come near the lowly abode of the poor .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">She fears the plain floor of the humble will spoil</l>
     <l n="6">Her silk shoes and hose , and her skirt-bottom soil ;</l>
     <l n="7">And so she goes winching ; and holds up her dress</l>
     <l n="8">So high , it were well if her heels would show less .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">But when she walks through the fine streets of the town ,</l>
     <l n="10">She puts on fine airs , and displays her rich gown ;</l>
     <l n="11">Till some , whom she passes , will think of the bird</l>
     <l n="12">Renowned for gay feathers , whose name you have heard .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">In thought she is trifling — in manner as vain</l>
     <l n="14">As that silly fowl , taking pride in his train ;</l>
     <l n="15">And none , who have marked her , will need to be told</l>
     <l n="16">That she has a heart hard , and haughty , and cold .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">I saw , when she met some poor children one day ,</l>
     <l n="18">Who asked her for alms , she turned frowning away ;</l>
     <l n="19">And told them , “ Poor people must work , to be fed ,</l>
     <l n="20">And not trouble ladies , to help them to bread . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">And just as the sad little mendicants said ,</l>
     <l n="22">Their mother was dying , their father was dead ,</l>
     <l n="23">She entered a store , with a smooth , smiling face ,</l>
     <l n="24">To lay out her purse in gay ribbons and lace .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">I saw her curl up her sour lip in disdain ,</l>
     <l n="26">Because Ellen Pitiful picked up the cane ,</l>
     <l n="27">A feeble old man had let fall in the sand ,</l>
     <l n="28">And placed it again in his tremulous hand .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">But little does haughty Miss Patty suppose ,</l>
     <l n="30">Of all , whom she visits , that any one knows</l>
     <l n="31">How stern she can look , when she ‘ s out of their sight ,</l>
     <l n="32">And fret at the servants , if all is not right .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">At home , she ‘ s unyielding , and sullen , and cross :</l>
     <l n="34">Her friends , when she ‘ s absent , esteem it no loss ;</l>
     <l n="35">And some , where she visits , in secret confess ,</l>
     <l n="36">That they love her no more , though they dread her much less .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">The truth is , Miss Patty , when young , never tried</l>
     <l n="38">To govern her temper , or conquer her pride .</l>
     <l n="39">The passions , unchecked in the heart of the child ,</l>
     <l n="40">Like weeds in a garden neglected , ran wild .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="41">They grew with her growth , with her strength became strong :</l>
     <l n="42">Her head , not then righted , has ever been wrong ;</l>
     <l n="43">And so she would never submit to be told</l>
     <l n="44">Of faults , by long habit made stubborn and bold .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="45">And now , among all my young friends , is there one ,—</l>
     <l n="46">A fair little girl is there under the sun ,</l>
     <l n="47">Who ‘ d rise to a woman , and have it allowed</l>
     <l n="48">That she is a likeness of Miss PATTY PROUD ?</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>I CAUGHT A BIRD .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I caught a bird : She flitted by ,</l>
     <l n="2">So near my window lifted high ,</l>
     <l n="3">She softly ventured in , to spy</l>
     <l n="4">What I might be about :</l>
     <l n="5">And then , a little wildered thing ,</l>
     <l n="6">Like many a one without a wing ,</l>
     <l n="7">She fluttered , struck , and seemed to sing ,</l>
     <l n="8">“ Alas ! I can n't get out . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">She saw her kindred on the tree</l>
     <l n="10">Before her , sporting light and free ;</l>
     <l n="11">But felt a power , she could not see ,</l>
     <l n="12">Repel and hold her back .</l>
     <l n="13">In vain her beak , and breast , and feet</l>
     <l n="14">Against the crystal pane were beat :</l>
     <l n="15">She could not break the clear deceit ,</l>
     <l n="16">Nor find her airy track .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">The pretty wanderer then I took ;</l>
     <l n="18">And felt her frame with terror shook :</l>
     <l n="19">She gave the sad and piteous look</l>

   <p>THE SILVER BIRDSNEST .</p>
   <p>We were shown a beautiful specimen of the ingenuity of birds , a few days since , by Dr. Cook , of this borough . It was a birdsnest made entirely of silver wires , beautifully woven together . The nest was found on a sycamore tree , on the Condorus , by Dr. Francis Beard , of York county . It was the nest of a hanging-bird ; and the material was probably obtained from a soldier 's epaulet , which it had found .</p>

     <l n="34">She woke ! She rose —</l>
     <l n="35">She moved among the morning stars , and gave</l>
     <l n="36">The birth-song of a world .</l>
     <l n="37">Our infant globe ,</l>
     <l n="38">With life 's first pulse , rolled in its ether bed ,</l>
     <l n="39">Robed with the sunlight , mantled by the moon ,</l>
     <l n="40">Or tenderly embraced by stellar rays :</l>
     <l n="41">Death , with his pale , cold finger , had not touched</l>
     <l n="42">Its beauty then . No stain of guilt was here ,</l>
     <l n="43">And so , no cloud of sorrow cast a shade ,</l>
     <l n="44">Or rained its bitter drops on fruit or flower .</l>
     <l n="45">As earth , on every side , shone fair to heaven ,</l>
     <l n="46">Not knowing yet whereto she was ordained ,</l>
     <l n="47">Music , from her celestial walks looked down ,</l>
     <l n="48">And thought , how sweetly she could wake the hills ,</l>
     <l n="49">Sing through the silent forests — in the vales —</l>
     <l n="50">Beside the silver waters pour her sounds ;</l>
     <l n="51">And multiply her numbers by the rocks !</l>
     <l n="52">She longed to give it voice to speak to God ;</l>
     <l n="53">And , being told of her blest ministry ,</l>
     <l n="54">Bathed in a flood of glory , till her wings</l>
     <l n="55">Dripped with effulgence , as they spread , and poised ,</l>
     <l n="56">And passed the pearly gates in earthward flight .</l>
     <l n="57">Made viewless by the circumambient air ,</l>
     <l n="58">And scattering voices to its feathered tribes ,</l>
     <l n="59">As down she hastened to the shining sphere ,</l>
     <l n="60">The happy angel reached the beauteous earth .</l>
     <l n="61">At her electric touch , young nature smiled ,</l>
     <l n="62">And kindled into rapture ; then broke forth</l>
     <l n="63">With thousand , thousand songs .</l>
     <l n="64">The green turf woke ;</l>
     <l n="65">The sea-shells hummed along the vocal shore ,</l>
     <l n="66">The busy bee , upon his honeyed flower .</l>
     <l n="67">Osier and reed became Eolian lyres .</l>
     <l n="68">Trees bore sweet minstrels ; while rock , hill , and dell</l>
     <l n="69">Sang to each other in a joyous round .</l>
     <l n="70">MAN , that mysterious instrument of God ,</l>
     <l n="71">When the warm soul of new-descended power</l>
     <l n="72">Breathed on his heart-strings , lifted up his voice ,</l>
     <l n="73">Chanting , “ JEHOVAH ! ”</l>
     <l n="74">Since that blessed hour ,</l>
     <l n="75">While still her home is heaven , Music has ne'er</l>
     <l n="76">This darkened world forsaken . She delights ,</l>
     <l n="77">Though man may lose , or keep the paths of peace ,</l>
     <l n="78">To soothe , to cheer , to light and warm his heart ;</l>
     <l n="79">And lends her wings to waft it to the skies .</l>
     <l n="80">She throws a lustre o'er Devotion 's face —</l>
     <l n="81">Drinks off the tear from Sorrow 's languid eye —</l>
     <l n="82">Tames wild Despair — brings Hope a brighter bloom —</l>
     <l n="83">Lulls Hate to rest — Love 's ruffled bosom smooths ;</l>
     <l n="84">Pours honey into many a bitter cup ;</l>
     <l n="85">And often gives the black and heavy hour</l>
     <l n="86">A downy breast and pinions tipped with light .</l>
     <l n="87">She steals all balmy through the prisoner 's grates ,</l>
     <l n="88">Making that sad one half forget their use .</l>
     <l n="89">With holy spell she binds the exile 's heart ,</l>
     <l n="90">And pours her oil upon its hidden wounds .</l>
     <l n="91">Kings are her lovers — cottagers her loves :</l>
     <l n="92">The hero and the pilgrim walk with her .</l>
     <l n="93">Her voice is sweet by cradled infancy ,</l>
     <l n="94">And from the pillow of the dying saint ,</l>
     <l n="95">When a glad spirit borrows her light wings</l>
     <l n="96">To practise for the skies , ere it unfolds</l>
     <l n="97">Its own , and breaks its tenure to the clay .</l>
     <l n="98">True , by man 's wanderings for his tempter 's lure ,</l>
     <l n="99">Music is often drawn to scenes unmeet</l>
     <l n="100">For purity like hers ; and made to bear</l>
     <l n="101">Unhallowed burdens ; or , to join in rites</l>
     <l n="102">To turpitude in fellest places held .</l>
     <l n="103">Yet , like the sun , whose beaming vesture , trailed</l>
     <l n="104">O'er all things staining , still defies a stain ;</l>
     <l n="105">And is at night withdrawn , and girded up ,</l>
     <l n="106">Warm and untarnished for the morning skies —</l>
     <l n="107">She comes unsullied from her baser walks ,</l>
     <l n="108">Sighs at the darkness , guilt and wo of earth ;</l>
     <l n="109">Breathes Zion 's air , and , warmed with heavenly fire ,</l>
     <l n="110">Mounts to her glorious home !</l>
     <l n="111">‘ T was she , who bore</l>
     <l n="112">The first grand offering of the free , on high ,</l>
     <l n="113">When to the shore , through Egypt 's solemn sea ,</l>
     <l n="114">The franchised Hebrews passed with feet dry-shod ,</l>
     <l n="115">And paeans gave to their Deliverer there .</l>
     <l n="116">She cheered the wanderers on ; and when they crossed</l>
     <l n="117">Over old Jordan , to the strong-armed foe ,</l>
     <l n="118">Still she was with them ; and her single breath</l>
     <l n="119">Laid the proud Painim 's city-walls in dust !</l>
     <l n="120">In native light , she walked Judea 's hills ,</l>
     <l n="121">And sipped the dew of Hermon from its flower</l>
     <l n="122">Before the Sun of righteousness arose .</l>
     <l n="123">The Prophet chose her to unseal his lips ,</l>
     <l n="124">Ere God spake through them ; and the Prophetess ,</l>
     <l n="125">To lift the heart 's pure gift from her 's to Heaven .</l>
     <l n="126">When Israel 's king was troubled , her soft hand</l>
     <l n="127">Put close , but gently , to his gloomy breast ,</l>
     <l n="128">Reached the dark spirit there , and laid it still ,</l>
     <l n="129">Bound by the chords a shepherd minstrel swept .</l>
     <l n="130">And since , her countless thousands she has brought</l>
     <l n="131">To heaven 's mild kingdom , happy captives led ,</l>
     <l n="132">By those sweet glowing strings of David 's lyre .</l>
     <l n="133">But oh ! her richest , dearest notes to man ,</l>
     <l n="134">In strains aerial over Bethlehem poured ,</l>
     <l n="135">When HE , whose brightness is the light of heaven ,</l>
     <l n="136">To earth descending for a mortal 's form ,</l>
     <l n="137">Laid by his glory , save one radiant mark ,</l>
     <l n="138">That moved through space , and o'er the infant hung ,</l>
     <l n="139">He summoned Music to attend him here ,</l>
     <l n="140">Announcing peace below !</l>
     <l n="141">He called her , too ,</l>
     <l n="142">To sweeten that sad supper , and to twine</l>
     <l n="143">Her mantle round him , and his few , grieved friends</l>
     <l n="144">To join their mournful spirits with the hymn ,</l>
     <l n="145">Ere to the Mount of Olives he went out</l>
     <l n="146">So sorrowful .</l>
     <l n="147">And now , his blessed word ,</l>
     <l n="148">A sacred pledge , is left to dying man ,</l>
     <l n="149">Then at his second coming in his power ,</l>
     <l n="150">Music shall still be with him ; and her voice</l>
     <l n="151">Sound through the tombs and wake the dead to life !</l>
