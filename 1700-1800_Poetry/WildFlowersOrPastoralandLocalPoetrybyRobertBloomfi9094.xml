    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">A man of the first eminence , in whose day ( fortunately perhaps for me ) I was not destined to appear before the public , or to abide the Herculean crab-tree of his criticism , Dr. Johnson , has said , in his preface to Shakspeare , that — “ Nothing can please many , and please long , but just representations of general nature . ” My representations of nature , whatever may be said of their justness , are not general , unless we admit , what I suspect to be the case , that nature in a village is very much like nature every where else . It will be observed that all my pictures are from humble life , and most of my heroines servant maids . Such I would have them : being fully persuaded that , in no other way would my endeavours , either to please or to instruct , have an equal chance of success .</p>
    <p n="2">The path I have thus taken , from necessity , as well as from choice , is well understood and approved by hundreds , who are capable of ranging in the higher walks of literature .— But with due deference to their superior claim , I confess , that no recompense has been half so grateful or half so agreeable to me as female approbation . To be readily and generally understood , to have my simple Tales almost instinctively relished by those who have so decided an influence over the lives , hearts , and manners of us all , is the utmost stretch of my ambition .</p>
    <p n="3">I here venture , before the public eye , a selection from the various pieces which have been the source of much pleasure , and the solace of my leisure hours during the last four years , and since the publication of the “ Rural Tales . ” Perhaps , in some of them , more of mirth is intermingled than many who know me would expect , or than the severe will be inclined to approve . But surely what I can say , or can be expected to say , on subjects of country life , would gain little by the seriousness of a preacher , or by exhibiting fallacious representations of what has long been termed Rural Innocence .</p>
    <p n="4">The Poem of “ Good Tidings ” is partially known to the world , but , as it was originally intended to assume its present appearance and size , I have gladly availed myself of an endeavour to improve it ; and , from its present extended circulation , I trust it will be new to thousands .</p>
    <p n="5">I anticipate some approbation from such readers as have been pleased with the “ Rural Tales ; ” yet , though I will not falsify my own feelings by assuming a diffidence which I do not conceive to be either manly or becoming , the conviction that some reputation is hazarded in “ a third attempt , ” is impressed deeply on my mind .</p>
    <p n="6">With such sentiments , and with a lively sense of the high honour , and a hope of the bright recompence , of applause from the good , when heightened by the self-approving voice of my own conscience , I commit the book to its fate .</p>
    <p n="7">ROBERT BLOOMFIELD .</p>
    <p n="8">DEDICATION .</p>
    <p n="9">TO MY ONLY SON .</p>
    <p n="10">MY DEAR BOY ,</p>
    <p n="11">In thus addressing myself to you , and in expressing my regard for your person , my anxiety for your health , and my devotion to your welfare , I enjoy an advantage over those dedicators who indulge in adulation ;— I shall at least be believed .</p>
    <p n="12">Should you arrive at that period when reason shall be mature , and affection or curiosity induce you to look back on your father 's poetical progress through life , you may conclude that he had many to boast as friends , whose names , in a dedication , would have honoured both him and his children ; but you must also reflect , that to particularize such friends was a point of peculiar delicacy . The earliest patron of my unprotected strains has the warm thanks which are his due , for the introduction of blessings which have been diffused through our whole family , and nothing will ever change this sentiment . But amidst a general feeling of gratitude , which those who know me will never dispute , I feel for you , Charles , what none but parents can conceive ; and on your account , my dear boy , there can be no harm in telling the world that I hope these “ Wild Flowers ” will be productive of sweets of the worldly kind ; for your unfortunate lameness ( should it never be removed ) may preclude you from the means of procuring comforts and advantages which might otherwise have fallen to your share .</p>
    <p n="13">What a lasting , what an unspeakable satisfaction would it be to know that the Ballads , the Plowman Stories , and the “ Broken Crutch ” of your father would eventually contribute to lighten your steps to manhood , and make your own crutch , through life , rather a memorial of affection than an object of sorrow .</p>
    <p n="14">With a parent 's feelings , and a parent 's cares and hopes ,</p>
    <p n="15">I am , Charles , yours ,</p>
    <p n="16">R. B .</p>

       <l n="128">THE HORKEY . A Provincial Ballad .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>ADVERTISEMENT .</p>
     <p>In the descriptive ballad which follows , it will be evident that I have endeavoured to preserve the style of a gossip , and to transmit the memorial of a custom , the extent or antiquity of which I am not acquainted with , and pretend not to enquire .</p>
     <p>In Suffolk husbandry the man who , ( whether by merit or by sufferance I know not ) goes foremost through the harvest with the scythe or the sickle , is honoured with the title of “ Lord , ” and at the Horkey , or harvest-home feast , collects what he can , for himself and brethren , from the farmers and visitors , to make a “ frolick ” afterwards , called “ the largess spending . ” By way of returning thanks , though perhaps formerly of much more , or of different signification , they immediately leave the seat of festivity , and with a very long and repeated shout of “ a largess , ” the number of shouts being regulated by the sums given , seem to wish to make themselves heard by the people of the surrounding farms . And before they rejoin the company within , the pranks and the jollity I have endeavoured to describe , usually take place . These customs , I believe , are going fast out of use ; which is one great reason for my trying to tell the rising race of mankind that such were the customs when I was a boy .</p>
     <p>I have annexed a glossary of such words as may be found by general readers to require explanation . And will add a short extract from Sir Thomas Brown , of Norwich , M. D. who was born three years before Milton , and outlived him eight years .</p>
     <p>“ It were not impossible to make an original reduction of many words of no general reception in England , but of common use in Norfolk , or peculiar to the East-Angle counties ; as , Bawnd , Bunny , Thurck , Enemis , Matchly , Sainmodithee , Mawther , Kedge , Seele , Straft , Clever , Dere , Nicked , Stingy , Noneare , Fett , Thepes , Gosgood , Kamp , Sibrit , Fangast , Sap , Cothish , Thokish , Bide-owe , Paxwax . Of these , and some others , of no easy originals , when time will permit , the resolution shall be attempted ; which to effect , the Danish language , new , and more ancient , may prove of good advantage : which nation remained here fifty years upon agreement , and have left many families in it , and the language of these parts had surely been more commixed and perplex , if the fleet of Hugo de Bones had not been cast away , wherein three-score thousand souldiers , out of Britany and Flanders , were to be wafted over , and were , by King John 's appointment , to have a settled habitation in the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk . ” Tract the viii . on Languages , particularly the Saxon .

     <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
     <p>To the few who know that I have employed my thoughts on the importance of Dr. Jenners 's discovery , it has generally and almost unexceptionably appeared a subject of little promise ; peculiarly unfit indeed for poetry . My method of treating it has endeared it to myself , for it indulges in domestic anecdote . The account given of my infancy and of my father 's burial , is not only poetically , but strictly true , and with me it has its weight accordingly . I have witnessed the destruction described in my brother 's family : and I have , in my own , insured the lives of four children by Vaccine Inoculation , who , I trust , are destined to look back upon the Small-pox of the scourge of days gone by .— My hopes are high , and my prayers sincere , for its universal adoption .</p>
     <p>The few notes subjoined are chiefly from “ Woodville on Inoculation ; ” and if I may escape the appearance of affectation of research , or a scientific treatment of the subject , I think the egotism , so conspicuous in the poem , ( as facts give force to argument ,) ought to be forgiven .</p>

No ! let the tide of passion roll along , Truth will be heard , and GOD will bless the song Indignant Reason , Pity , Joy , arise , And speak in thunder to the heart that sighs : Speak loud to parents ;— knew ye not the time When age itself , and manhood 's hardy prime , With horror saw their short-liv 'd friendships end . Yet dar 'd not visit e'en the dying friend ? Contagion , a foul serpent lurking near , Mock 'd Nature 's sigh and Friendship 's holy tear . Love ye your children ?— let that love arise , Pronounce the sentence , and the serpent dies ; Bid welcome a mild stranger at your door , Distress shall cease , those terrors reign no more . Love ye your neighbours ?— let that love be shown ; Risk not their children while you guard your own ; Give not a foe dominion o'er your blood , Plant not a poison , e'en to bring forth good ; For , woo the pest discreetly as you will , Deadly infection must attend him still . Then , let the serpent die ! this glorious prize Sets more than life and health before our eyes , For beauty triumphs too ! Beauty ! sweet name , The mother 's feelings kindling into flame ! For , where dwells she , who , while the virtues grow . With cold indifference marks the arching brow ? Or , with a lifeless heart and recreant blood , Sighs not for daughters fair as well as good ? That sigh is nature , and cannot decay , ‘ Tis universal as the beams of day ; Man knows and feels its truth ; for , Beauty 's call Rouses the coldest mortal of us all ; A glance warms age itself , and gives the boy The pulse of rapture and the sigh of joy . And is it then no conquest to insure Our lilies spotless and our roses pure ? Is it no triumph that the lovely face Inherits every line of Nature 's grace ? That the sweet precincts of the laughing eye Dread no rude scars , no foul deformity ? Our boast , old Time himself shall not impair . Of British maids pre-eminently fair ; But , as he rolls his years on years along , Shall keep the record of immortal song ; For song shall rise with ampler power to speak The new-born influence of Beauty 's cheek , Shall catch new fires in every sacred grove , Fresh inspiration from the lips of Love , And write for ever on the rising mind — DEAD IS ONE MORTAL FOE OF HUMAN KIND !</p>
