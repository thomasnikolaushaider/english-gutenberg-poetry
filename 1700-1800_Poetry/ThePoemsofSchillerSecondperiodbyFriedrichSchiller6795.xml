    <head>POEMS OF THE SECOND PERIOD .</head>
    <head>HYMN TO JOY .</head>
     <l n="1">Joy , thou goddess , fair , immortal ,</l>
     <l n="2">Offspring of Elysium ,</l>
     <l n="3">Mad with rapture , to the portal</l>
     <l n="4">Of thy holy fame we come !</l>
     <l n="5">Fashion 's laws , indeed , may sever ,</l>
     <l n="6">But thy magic joins again ;</l>
     <l n="7">All mankind are brethren ever</l>
     <l n="8">‘ Neath thy mild and gentle reign .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>CHORUS . Welcome , all ye myriad creatures ! Brethren , take the kiss of love ! Yes , the starry realms above Hide a Father 's smiling features !</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">He , that noble prize possessing —</l>
     <l n="2">He that boasts a friend that 's true ,</l>
     <l n="3">He whom woman 's love is blessing ,</l>
     <l n="4">Let him join the chorus too !</l>
     <l n="5">Aye , and he who but one spirit</l>
     <l n="6">On this earth can call his own !</l>
     <l n="7">He who no such bliss can merit ,</l>
     <l n="8">Let him mourn his fate alone !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>CHORUS . All who Nature 's tribes are swelling Homage pay to sympathy ; For she guides us up on high , Where the unknown has his dwelling .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">From the breasts of kindly Nature</l>
     <l n="2">All of joy imbibe the dew ;</l>
     <l n="3">Good and bad alike , each creature</l>
     <l n="4">Would her roseate path pursue .</l>
     <l n="5">‘ Tis through her the wine-cup maddens ,</l>
     <l n="6">Love and friends to man she gives !</l>
     <l n="7">Bliss the meanest reptile gladdens ,—</l>
     <l n="8">Near God 's throne the cherub lives !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>CHORUS . Bow before him , all creation ! Mortals , own the God of love ! Seek him high the stars above ,— Yonder is his habitation !</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Joy , in Nature 's wide dominion ,</l>
     <l n="2">Mightiest cause of all is found ;</l>
     <l n="3">And ‘ tis joy that moves the pinion ,</l>
     <l n="4">When the wheel of time goes round ;</l>
     <l n="5">From the bud she lures the flower —</l>
     <l n="6">Suns from out their orbs of light ;</l>
     <l n="7">Distant spheres obey her power ,</l>
     <l n="8">Far beyond all mortal sight .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>CHORUS . As through heaven 's expanse so glorious In their orbits suns roll on , Brethren , thus your proud race run , Glad as warriors all-victorious !</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Joy from truth 's own glass of fire</l>
     <l n="2">Sweetly on the searcher smiles ;</l>
     <l n="3">Lest on virtue 's steeps he tire ,</l>
     <l n="4">Joy the tedious path beguiles .</l>
     <l n="5">High on faith 's bright hill before us ,</l>
     <l n="6">See her banner proudly wave !</l>
     <l n="7">Joy , too , swells the angels ’ chorus ,—</l>
     <l n="8">Bursts the bondage of the grave !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>CHORUS . Mortals , meekly wait for heaven Suffer on in patient love ! In the starry realms above , Bright rewards by God are given .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">To the Gods we ne'er can render</l>
     <l n="2">Praise for every good they grant ;</l>
     <l n="3">Let us , with devotion tender ,</l>
     <l n="4">Minister to grief and want .</l>
     <l n="5">Quenched be hate and wrath forever ,</l>
     <l n="6">Pardoned be our mortal foe —</l>
     <l n="7">May our tears upbraid him never ,</l>
     <l n="8">No repentance bring him low !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>CHORUS . Sense of wrongs forget to treasure — Brethren , live in perfect love ! In the starry realms above , God will mete as we may measure .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Joy within the goblet flushes ,</l>
     <l n="2">For the golden nectar , wine ,</l>
     <l n="3">Every fierce emotion hushes ,—</l>
     <l n="4">Fills the breast with fire divine .</l>
     <l n="5">Brethren , thus in rapture meeting ,</l>
     <l n="6">Send ye round the brimming cup ,—</l>
     <l n="7">Yonder kindly spirit greeting ,</l>
     <l n="8">While the foam to heaven mounts up !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>CHORUS . He whom seraphs worship ever ; Whom the stars praise as they roll , Yes to him now drain the bowl Mortal eye can see him never !</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Courage , ne'er by sorrow broken !</l>
     <l n="2">Aid where tears of virtue flow ;</l>
     <l n="3">Faith to keep each promise spoken !</l>
     <l n="4">Truth alike to friend and foe !</l>
     <l n="5">‘ Neath kings ’ frowns a manly spirit !—</l>
     <l n="6">Brethren , noble is the prize —</l>
     <l n="7">Honor due to every merit !</l>
     <l n="8">Death to all the brood of lies !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>CHORUS . Draw the sacred circle closer ! By this bright wine plight your troth To be faithful to your oath ! Swear it by the Star-Disposer !</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Safety from the tyrant 's power !<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span></l>
     <l n="2">Mercy e'en to traitors base !</l>
     <l n="3">Hope in death 's last solemn hour !</l>
     <l n="4">Pardon when before His face !</l>
     <l n="5">Lo , the dead shall rise to heaven !</l>
     <l n="6">Brethren hail the blest decree ;</l>
     <l n="7">Every sin shall be forgiven ,</l>
     <l n="8">Hell forever cease to be !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>CHORUS . When the golden bowl is broken , Gentle sleep within the tomb ! Brethren , may a gracious doom By the Judge of man be spoken !</p>

    <head>THE INVINCIBLE ARMADA .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">She comes , she comes — the burden of the deeps !</l>
     <l n="2">Beneath her wails the universal sea !</l>
     <l n="3">With clanking chains and a new god , she sweeps ,</l>
     <l n="4">And with a thousand thunders , unto thee !</l>
     <l n="5">The ocean-castles and the floating hosts —</l>
     <l n="6">Ne'er on their like looked the wild water !— Well</l>
     <l n="7">May man the monster name “ Invincible . ”</l>
     <l n="8">O'er shuddering waves she gathers to thy coasts !</l>
     <l n="9">The horror that she spreads can claim</l>
     <l n="10">Just title to her haughty name .</l>
     <l n="11">The trembling Neptune quails</l>
     <l n="12">Under the silent and majestic forms ;</l>
     <l n="13">The doom of worlds in those dark sails ;—</l>
     <l n="14">Near and more near they sweep ! and slumber all the storms !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="15">Before thee , the array ,</l>
     <l n="16">Blest island , empress of the sea !</l>
     <l n="17">The sea-born squadrons threaten thee ,</l>
     <l n="18">And thy great heart , Britannia !</l>
     <l n="19">Woe to thy people , of their freedom proud —</l>
     <l n="20">She rests , a thunder heavy in its cloud !</l>
     <l n="21">Who , to thy hand the orb and sceptre gave ,</l>
     <l n="22">That thou should'st be the sovereign of the nations ?</l>
     <l n="23">To tyrant kings thou wert thyself the slave ,</l>
     <l n="24">Till freedom dug from law its deep foundations ;</l>
     <l n="25">The mighty Chart the citizens made kings ,</l>
     <l n="26">And kings to citizens sublimely bowed !</l>
     <l n="27">And thou thyself , upon thy realm of water ,</l>
     <l n="28">Hast thou not rendered millions up to slaughter ,</l>
     <l n="29">When thy ships brought upon their sailing wings</l>
     <l n="30">The sceptre — and the shroud ?</l>
     <l n="31">What should'st thou thank ?— Blush , earth , to hear and feel</l>
     <l n="32">What should'st thou thank ?— Thy genius and thy steel !</l>
     <l n="33">Behold the hidden and the giant fires !</l>
     <l n="34">Behold thy glory trembling to its fall !</l>
     <l n="35">Thy coming doom the round earth shall appal ,</l>
     <l n="36">And all the hearts of freemen beat for thee ,</l>
     <l n="37">And all free souls their fate in thine foresee —</l>
     <l n="38">Theirs is thy glory 's fall !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="39">One look below the Almighty gave ,</l>
     <l n="40">Where streamed the lion-flags of thy proud foe ;</l>
     <l n="41">And near and wider yawned the horrent grave .</l>
     <l n="42">“ And who , ” saith He , “ shall lay mine England low —</l>
     <l n="43">The stem that blooms with hero-deeds —</l>
     <l n="44">The rock when man from wrong a refuge needs —</l>
     <l n="45">The stronghold where the tyrant comes in vain ?</l>
     <l n="46">Who shall bid England vanish from the main ?</l>
     <l n="47">Ne'er be this only Eden freedom knew ,</l>
     <l n="48">Man 's stout defence from power , to fate consigned . ”</l>
     <l n="49">God the Almighty blew ,</l>
     <l n="50">And the Armada went to every wind !</l>

    <head>THE GODS OF GREECE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Ye in the age gone by ,</l>
     <l n="2">Who ruled the world — a world how lovely then !—</l>
     <l n="3">And guided still the steps of happy men</l>
     <l n="4">In the light leading-strings of careless joy !</l>
     <l n="5">Ah , flourished then your service of delight !</l>
     <l n="6">How different , oh , how different , in the day</l>
     <l n="7">When thy sweet fanes with many a wreath were bright ,</l>
     <l n="8">O Venus Amathusia !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Then , through a veil of dreams</l>
     <l n="10">Woven by song , truth 's youthful beauty glowed ,</l>
     <l n="11">And life 's redundant and rejoicing streams</l>
     <l n="12">Gave to the soulless , soul — where'r they flowed</l>
     <l n="13">Man gifted nature with divinity</l>
     <l n="14">To lift and link her to the breast of love ;</l>
     <l n="15">All things betrayed to the initiate eye</l>
     <l n="16">The track of gods above !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">Where lifeless — fixed afar ,</l>
     <l n="18">A flaming ball to our dull sense is given ,</l>
     <l n="19">Phoebus Apollo , in his golden car ,</l>
     <l n="20">In silent glory swept the fields of heaven !</l>
     <l n="21">On yonder hill the Oread was adored ,</l>
     <l n="22">In yonder tree the Dryad held her home ;</l>
     <l n="23">And from her urn the gentle Naiad poured</l>
     <l n="24">The wavelet 's silver foam .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">Yon bay , chaste Daphne wreathed ,</l>
     <l n="26">Yon stone was mournful Niobe 's mute cell ,</l>
     <l n="27">Low through yon sedges pastoral Syrinx breathed ,</l>
     <l n="28">And through those groves wailed the sweet Philomel ,</l>
     <l n="29">The tears of Ceres swelled in yonder rill —</l>
     <l n="30">Tears shed for Proserpine to Hades borne ;</l>
     <l n="31">And , for her lost Adonis , yonder hill</l>
     <l n="32">Heard Cytherea mourn !—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">Heaven 's shapes were charmed unto</l>
     <l n="34">The mortal race of old Deucalion ;</l>
     <l n="35">Pyrrha 's fair daughter , humanly to woo ,</l>
     <l n="36">Came down , in shepherd-guise , Latona 's son</l>
     <l n="37">Between men , heroes , gods , harmonious then</l>
     <l n="38">Love wove sweet links and sympathies divine ;</l>
     <l n="39">Blest Amathusia , heroes , gods , and men ,</l>
     <l n="40">Equals before thy shrine !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="41">Not to that culture gay ,</l>
     <l n="42">Stern self-denial , or sharp penance wan !</l>
     <l n="43">Well might each heart be happy in that day —</l>
     <l n="44">For gods , the happy ones , were kin to man !</l>
     <l n="45">The beautiful alone the holy there !</l>
     <l n="46">No pleasure shamed the gods of that young race ;</l>
     <l n="47">So that the chaste Camoenae favoring were ,</l>
     <l n="48">And the subduing grace !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="49">A palace every shrine ;</l>
     <l n="50">Your sports heroic ;— yours the crown</l>
     <l n="51">Of contests hallowed to a power divine ,</l>
     <l n="52">As rushed the chariots thundering to renown .</l>
     <l n="53">Fair round the altar where the incense breathed ,</l>
     <l n="54">Moved your melodious dance inspired ; and fair</l>
     <l n="55">Above victorious brows , the garland wreathed</l>
     <l n="56">Sweet leaves round odorous hair !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="57">The lively Thyrsus-swinger ,</l>
     <l n="58">And the wild car the exulting panthers bore ,</l>
     <l n="59">Announced the presence of the rapture-bringer —</l>
     <l n="60">Bounded the Satyr and blithe Faun before ;</l>
     <l n="61">And Maenads , as the frenzy stung the soul ,</l>
     <l n="62">Hymned in their maddening dance , the glorious wine —</l>
     <l n="63">As ever beckoned to the lusty bowl</l>
     <l n="64">The ruddy host divine !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="65">Before the bed of death</l>
     <l n="66">No ghastly spectre stood — but from the porch</l>
     <l n="67">Of life , the lip — one kiss inhaled the breath ,</l>
     <l n="68">And the mute graceful genius lowered a torch .</l>
     <l n="69">The judgment-balance of the realms below ,</l>
     <l n="70">A judge , himself of mortal lineage , held ;</l>
     <l n="71">The very furies at the Thracian 's woe ,</l>
     <l n="72">Were moved and music-spelled .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="73">In the Elysian grove</l>
     <l n="74">The shades renewed the pleasures life held dear :</l>
     <l n="75">The faithful spouse rejoined remembered love ,</l>
     <l n="76">And rushed along the meads the charioteer ;</l>
     <l n="77">There Linus poured the old accustomed strain ;</l>
     <l n="78">Admetus there Alcestis still could greet ; his</l>
     <l n="79">Friend there once more Orestes could regain ,</l>
     <l n="80">His arrows — Philoctetes !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="81">More glorious than the meeds</l>
     <l n="82">That in their strife with labor nerved the brave ,</l>
     <l n="83">To the great doer of renowned deeds</l>
     <l n="84">The Hebe and the heaven the Thunderer gave .</l>
     <l n="85">Before the rescued rescuer<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>of the dead ,</l>
     <l n="86">Bowed down the silent and immortal host ;</l>
     <l n="87">And the twain stars<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>their guiding lustre shed ,</l>
     <l n="88">On the bark tempest-tossed !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="89">Art thou , fair world , no more ?</l>

     <l n="92">Can we the footstep of sweet fable trace !</l>
     <l n="93">The meadows mourn for the old hallowing life ;</l>
     <l n="94">Vainly we search the earth of gods bereft ;</l>
     <l n="95">Where once the warm and living shapes were rife ,</l>

     <l n="97">Cold , from the north , has gone</l>

     <l n="100">A universe of gods must pass away !</l>
     <l n="101">Mourning , I search on yonder starry steeps ,</l>

     <l n="108">Around , and rules her — by our bliss unblessed —</l>
     <l n="109">Dull to the art that colors or creates ,</l>
     <l n="110">Like the dead timepiece , godless nature creeps</l>
     <l n="111">Her plodding round , and , by the leaden weights ,</l>

     <l n="117">Home to the poet 's land the gods are flown ,</l>
