   <p>MEMOIR OF HENRY KIRKE WHITE .</p>
   <p>BY SIR HARRIS NICOLAS .</p>
   <p>Thine , Henry , is a deathless name on earth , Thine amaranthine wreaths , new pluck 'd in Heaven ! By what aspiring child of mortal birth Could more be ask 'd , to whom might more be given TOWNSEND .</p>
   <p>It has been said that the contrasts of light and shade are as necessary to biography as to painting , and that the character which is radiant with genius and virtue requires to be relieved by more common and opposite qualities . Though this may be true as a principle , there are many exceptions ; and the life of Henry Kirke White , whose merits were unalloyed by a single vice , is one of the most memorable . The history of his short and melancholy career , by Mr. Southey , is extremely popular ; and when it is remembered that its author is one of the most distinguished of living writers , that as a biographer he is unrivalled , and that he had access to all the materials which exist , it would be as vain to expect from the present Memoir any new facts , as it would be absurd to hope that it will be more worthy of attention than the imperishable monument which his generous friend has erected to his memory .</p>
   <p>There is , however , nothing inconsistent with this admission , in presuming that a Life of the Poet might be written almost as interesting as the one alluded to , and without the writer assuming to himself any unusual sagacity . As Mr. Southey 's narrative is prefixed to a collection of all Kirke White 's remains , in prose as well as in verse , his letters are inserted as part of his works , instead of extracts from them being introduced into the Memoir . This volume will , on the contrary , be confined to his Poems ; and such parts of his letters as describe his situation and feelings at particular periods will be introduced into the account of his life . Indeed , so frequent are the allusions to himself in those letters as well as in his poems , that he may be almost considered an autobiographer ; and the writer who substitutes his own cold and lifeless sketch for the glowing and animated portrait which these memorials of genius afford , must either be deficient in skill , or be under the dominion of overweening vanity .</p>
   <p>Few who have risen to eminence were , on the paternal side at least , of humbler origin than Henry Kirke White . His father , John White , was a butcher at Nottingham ; but his mother , who bore the illustrious name of Neville , is said to have belonged to a respectable family in Staffordshire . He was born at Nottingham on the 21st of March , 1785 ; and in his earliest years indications were observed of the genius for which he was afterwards distinguished . In his poem “ Childhood , ” he has graphically described the little school where , between the age of three and five , he</p>
   <p>“ enter 'd , though with toil and pain , The low vestibule of learning 's fane . ”</p>
   <p>The venerable dame by whom he was</p>
   <p>“ inured to alphabetic toils , ”</p>
   <p>and whose worth he gratefully commemorates , had the discernment to perceive her charge 's talents , and even foretold his future celebrity :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ And , as she gave my diligence its praise ,</l>
     <l n="2">Talk 'd of the honour of my future days . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>If he did not deceive himself , it was at this period that his imagination became susceptible of poetic associations . Speaking of the eagerness with which he left the usual sports of children to listen to tales of imaginary woe , and of the effect which they produced , he says ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Beloved moment ! then ‘ t was first I caught</l>
     <l n="2">The first foundation of romantic thought ;</l>
     <l n="3">Then first I shed bold Fancy 's thrilling tear ,</l>
     <l n="4">Then first that Poesy charm 'd mine infant ear .</l>
     <l n="5">Soon stored with much of legendary lore ,</l>
     <l n="6">The sports of childhood charm 'd my soul no more ;</l>
     <l n="7">Far from the scene of gaiety and noise ,</l>
     <l n="8">Far , far from turbulent and empty joys ,</l>
     <l n="9">I hied me to the thick o'erarching shade ,</l>
     <l n="10">And there , on mossy carpet , listless laid ;</l>
     <l n="11">While at my feet the rippling runnel ran ,</l>
     <l n="12">The days of wild romance antique I 'd scan ;</l>
     <l n="13">Soar on the wings of fancy through the air ,</l>
     <l n="14">To realms of light , and pierce the radiance there . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The peculiar disposition of his mind , having thus early displayed itself , every day added to its force . Study and abstraction were his greatest pleasures , and a love of reading became his predominant passion . “ I could fancy , ” said his eldest sister , “ I see him in his little chair with a large book upon his knee , and my mother calling , ‘ Henry , my love , come to dinner , ’ which was repeated so often without being regarded , that she was obliged to change the tone of her voice before she could rouse him . ”</p>
   <p>At the age of six he was placed under the care of the Rev . John Blanchard , who kept the best school in Nottingham , where he learnt writing , arithmetic , and French ; and he continued there for several years . During that time two facts are related of him which prove the precocity of his talents . When about seven , he was accustomed to go secretly into his father 's kitchen and teach the servant to read and write ; and he composed a tale of a Swiss emigrant , which he gave her , being too diffident to show it to his mother . In his eleventh year he wrote a separate theme for each of the twelve or fourteen boys in his class ; and the excellence of the various pieces obtained his master 's applause .</p>
   <p>Henry was destined for his father 's trade , and the efforts of his mother to change that intention were for some time fruitless . Even while he was at school , one day in every week , and his leisure hours on the others , were employed in carrying meat to his father 's customers ; but a dispute between his father and his master having caused him to be removed from school , one of the ushers , from malice or ignorance , told his mother that it was impossible to make her son do any thing . The person who reported so unfavourably of his abilities , little knew that he had then given ample evidence of his talents , in some poetical satires which his treatment at school had provoked , but which he afterwards destroyed .</p>
   <p>Soon after he quitted Mr. Blanchard 's school he was intrusted to Mr. Shipley , who discovered his pupil 's abilities , and relieved his friends ’ uneasiness on the subject . His earliest production that has been preserved was written in his thirteenth year , “ On being confined to School one pleasant Morning in Spring , ” in which a schoolboy 's love of liberty , and his envy of the freedom of a neighbouring wren , are expressed with plaintive simplicity .</p>
   <p>About this time a slight improvement took place in his situation . His mother , to whom he was indebted for all the happiness of his childhood , opened a day school , and , as it abstracted her from the groveling cares of a butcher 's shop , his home was made much more comfortable ; and , instead of being confined to his father 's business , he was placed in a stocking loom , with the view of bringing him up to the trade of a hosier , the poverty of his family still precluding the hope of a profession .</p>
   <p>It may easily be believed that this occupation ill agreed with the aspirations of his mind . From his mother he had few secrets , and in her ear he breathed his disgust and unhappiness . “ He could not bear , ” he said , “ the idea of spending some years of his life in shining and folding up stockings ; ” he wanted “ something to occupy his brain , and he should be wretched if he continued longer at this trade , or indeed in any thing , except one of the learned professions . ” For a year these remonstrances were ineffectual ; but no persuasions , even when urged with maternal tenderness , could reconcile him to his lot . He sought for consolation with the Muses , and wrote an “ Address to Contemplation , ” in which he describes his feelings :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Why along</l>
     <l n="2">The dusky track of commerce should I toil ,</l>
     <l n="3">When , with an easy competence content ,</l>
     <l n="4">I can alone be happy ; where , with thee ,</l>
     <l n="5">I may enjoy the loveliness of Nature ,</l>
     <l n="6">And loose the wings of fancy ! Thus alone</l>
     <l n="7">Can I partake of happiness on earth ;</l>
     <l n="8">And to be happy here is man 's chief end ,</l>
     <l n="9">For to be happy he must needs be good . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>There are few obstacles that perseverance will not overcome ; and penury and a parent 's obstinacy were both surmounted by Kirke White 's importunity . Finding it useless to chain him longer to the hosier 's loom , he was placed in the office of Messrs. Coldham and Enfield , Town Clerk and attorneys of Nottingham , some time in May , 1799 , when he was in his fifteenth year ; but as a premium could not be given with him , it was agreed that he should serve two years before he was articled . A few months after he entered upon his new employment , he began a correspondence with his brother , Mr. Neville White , who was then a medical student in London ; and in a letter , dated in September , 1799 , he thus spoke of his situation and prospects :</p>
   <p>“ It is now nearly four months since I entered into Mr. Coldham 's office ; and it is with pleasure I can assure you , that I never yet found any thing disagreeable , but , on the contrary , every thing I do seems a pleasure to me , and for a very obvious reason ,— it is a business which I like — a business which I chose before all others ; and I have two good-tempered , easy masters , but who will , nevertheless , see that their business is done in a neat and proper manner . ” — “ A man that understands the law is sure to have business ; and in case I have no thoughts , in case , that is , that I do not aspire to hold the honourable place of a barrister , I shall feel sure of gaining a genteel livelihood at the business to which I am articled . ”</p>
   <p>At the suggestion of his employers , he devoted the greater part of his leisure to Latin ; and , though he was but slightly assisted , he was able in ten months to read Horace with tolerable facility , and had made some progress in Greek . Having but little time for these pursuits , he accustomed himself to decline the Greek nouns and verbs during his walks to and from the office , and he thereby acquired a habit of studying while walking , that never deserted him . The account which Mr. Southey has given of his application , and of the success that attended it , is astonishing . Though living with his family , he nearly estranged himself from their society . At meals , and during the evenings , a book was constantly in his hands ; and as he refused to sup with them , to prevent any loss of time , his meal was sent to him in his little apartment . Law , Greek , Latin , Italian , Spanish , and Portuguese , chemistry , astronomy , electricity , drawing , music , and mechanics , by turns engaged his attention ; and though his acquirements in some of those studies were very superficial , his proficiency in many of them was far from contemptible . His papers on law evince so much industry , that had that subject alone occupied his leisure hours , his diligence would have been commendable . He was a tolerable Italian scholar , and in the classics he afterwards attained reputation ; but of the sciences and of Spanish and Portuguese , his knowledge was not , it may be inferred , very great . His ear for music was good , and his passionate attachment to it is placed beyond a doubt by his verses on its effects :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ With her in pensive mood I long to roam</l>
     <l n="2">At midnight 's hour , or evening 's calm decline ,</l>
     <l n="3">And thoughtful o'er the falling streamlet 's foam ,</l>
     <l n="4">In calm Seclusion 's hermit-walks recline : ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But he checked his ardour , lest it might interfere with more essential studies : and his musical attainments were limited to playing pleasingly on the piano , composing the bass to the air at the same time .</p>
   <p>Ambition was one of the most powerful feelings of his nature , and it is rare indeed , when it is not the companion of great talents . It developed itself first in spurning trade ; and no sooner did he find himself likely to become an attorney , than he aspired to the bar . But his earliest and strongest passion was for literary distinction ; and he was scarcely removed from the trammels of school , before he sought admission into a literary society , in his native town . His extreme youth rendered him objectionable ; but , after repeated refusals , he at last succeeded . In the association there were six professors , and being , on the first vacancy , appointed to the chair of literature , he soon justified the choice . Taking “ genius ” as his theme , he addressed the assembly in an extemporaneous lecture of two hours and three-quarters duration , with so much success , that the audience unanimously voted him their thanks , declaring that “ the society had never heard a better lecture delivered from the chair which he so much honoured . ” To judge properly of this circumstance , it would be necessary to know of whom the society was composed ; but with so flattering a testimony to his abilities , the sanguine boy naturally placed a high estimate on them .</p>
   <p>The establishment of a Magazine called the Monthly Preceptor , which proposed prize themes for young persons , afforded Kirke White an opportunity of trying his literary powers . In a letter written in June , 1800 , to his brother , speaking of that work he says , “ I am noticed as worthy of commendation , and as affording an encouraging prospect of future excellence . You will laugh . I have also turned poet , and have translated an Ode of Horace into English verse . ” His productions gained him several of the prizes ; and he soon afterwards became a contributor to the Monthly Mirror , his compositions in which attracted the attention of Mr. Hill , the proprietor of the work , and of Mr. Capel Lofft , a gentleman who distinguished himself by his patronage of Bloomfield .</p>
   <p>Though on entering an attorney 's office the bar was the object of his hopes , a constitutional deafness soon convinced him that he was not adapted for the duties of an advocate ; and his thoughts , from conscientious motives , became directed to the Church .</p>
   <p>When about fifteen , his mind was agitated by doubt and anxiety on the most important of all subjects ; and the chaos of opinions which extensive and miscellaneous reading so often produces on ardent and imaginative temperaments , is well described in his little poem entitled , “ My own Character , ” wherein he represents himself as a prey to the most opposite impressions , and as being in a miserable state of incertitude :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ First I premise it 's my honest conviction ,</l>
     <l n="2">That my breast is the chaos of all contradiction ,</l>
     <l n="3">Religious — deistic — now loyal and warm ,</l>
     <l n="4">Then a dagger-drawn democrat hot for reform ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Now moody and sad , now unthinking and gay ,</l>
     <l n="6">To all points of the compass I veer in a day . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In this sketch there is evidently much truth ; and it affords a striking idea of a plastic and active mind , on which every thing makes an impression , where one idea follows another in such rapid succession , that the former is not so entirely removed , but that some remains of it are amalgamated with its successor . A youth whose intellect is thus tossed in a whirlpool of conflicting speculations , resembles a goodly ship newly launched , which , until properly steadied by ballast , reels from side to side , the sport of every undulation of the waters .</p>
   <p>About this time young White 's religious feelings were strongly affected by the conversion of his friend , Mr. Almond , whose opinions were previously as unsettled as his own . To escape the raillery with which he expected White would assail him on learning the change in his sentiments , Almond avoided his society ; and when his friend offered to defend his opinions , if Henry would allow the divine originality of the Bible , he exclaimed , “ Good God ! you surely regard me in a worse light than I deserve . ” The discussion that followed , and the perusal of Scott 's “ Force of Truth , ” which Almond placed in his hands , induced him to direct his attention seriously to the subject ; but an affecting incident soon afterwards showed how deeply he was then influenced by religious considerations . On the evening before Mr. Almond left Nottingham for Cambridge , he was requested by White to accompany him to his apartment . The moment they entered , Henry burst into tears , declaring that his anguish of mind was insupportable ; and he entreated Almond to kneel and pray for him . Their tears and supplications were cordially mingled , and when they were about to separate , White said , “ What must I do ? You are the only friend to whom I can apply in this agonizing state , and you are about to leave me . My literary associates are all inclined to deism . I have no one with whom I can communicate . ”</p>
   <p>It is instructive to learn to what circumstance such a person as Kirke White was indebted for the knowledge “ which causes not to err . ” This information occurs in a letter from him to a Mr. Booth , in August , 1801 ; and it also fixes the date of the happy change that influenced every thought and every action of his future life , which gave the energy of virtue to his exertions , soothed the asperities of a temper naturally impetuous and irritable , and enabled him , at a period when manhood is full of hope and promise , to view the approaches of death with the calmness of a philosopher , and the resignation of a saint .</p>
   <p>After thanking Mr. Booth for the present of Jones 's work on the Trinity , he thus describes his religious impressions previous to its perusal , and the effect it produced :</p>
   <p>“ Religious polemics , indeed , have seldom formed a part of my studies ; though whenever I happened accidentally to turn my thoughts to the subject of the Protestant doctrine of the Godhead , and compared it with Arian and Socinian , many doubts interfered , and I even began to think that the more nicely the subject was investigated , the more perplexed it would appear , and was on the point of forming a resolution to go to heaven in my own way , without meddling or involving myself in the inextricable labyrinth of controversial dispute , when I received and perused this excellent treatise , which finally cleared up the mists which my ignorance had conjured around me , and clearly pointed out the real truth . ”</p>
   <p>From the moment he became convinced of the truths of Christianity , all the enthusiasm of his nature was kindled . The ministry only , was deemed worthy of his ambition ; and he devoted his thoughts to the sacred office with a zeal that justified a hope of the richest fruits . In a letter to his friend , Mr. Almond , in November , 1803 , he says ,</p>
   <p>“ My dear friend , I cannot adequately express what I owe to you on the score of religion . I told Mr. Robinson you were the first instrument of my being brought to think deeply on religious subjects ; and I feel more and more every day , that if it had not been for you , I might , most probably , have been now buried in apathy and unconcern . Though I am in a great measure blessed ,— I mean blessed with faith , now pretty steadfast , and heavy convictions , I am far from being happy . My sins have been of a dark hue , and manifold : I have made Fame my God , and Ambition my shrine . I have placed all my hopes on the things of this world . I have knelt to Dagon ; I have worshipped the evil creations of my own proud heart , and God had well nigh turned his countenance from me in wrath ; perhaps one step further , and he might have shut me for ever from his rest . I now turn my eyes to Jesus , my Saviour , my atonement , with hope and confidence : he will not repulse the imploring penitent ; his arms are open to all , they are open even to me ; and in return for such a mercy , what can I do less than dedicate my whole life to his service ? My thoughts would fain recur at intervals to my former delights ; but I am now on my guard to restrain and keep them in . I know now where they ought to concentre , and with the blessing of God , they shall there all tend .</p>
   <p>“ My next publication of poems will be solely religious . I shall not destroy those of a different nature , which now lie before me ; but they will , most probably , sleep in my desk , until , in the good time of my great Lord and Master , I shall receive my passport from this world of vanity . I am now bent on a higher errand than that of the attainment of poetical fame ; poetry , in future , will be my relaxation , not my employment .— Adieu to literary ambition ! ‘ You do not aspire to be prime minister , ’ said Mr. Robinson ; ‘ you covet a far higher character — to be the humblest among those who minister to their Maker . ’ ”</p>
   <p>To the arguments of his friends on the impolicy of quitting a profession to which he had given so much of his time , and on the obstacles to the attainment of his wishes , he was impenetrable . His employers generously offered to cancel his articles as soon as he could show that his resources were likely to support him at the University . Friends arose as they became necessary , and more than one or two persons exerted themselves to promote his views ; but his principal reliance was on the sale of a little volume of Poems , which , at the suggestion of Mr. Capel Lofft , he prepared for the press .</p>
   <p>The history of an author 's first book is always interesting , and Kirke White 's was attended with unusual incidents . A novice in literature often imagines that it is important his work should be dedicated to some person of rank ; and the Countess of Derby was applied to , who declined , on the ground that she never accepted a compliment of that nature . He then addressed the Duchess of Devonshire ; and a letter , with the manuscript , was left at her house . The difficulty of obtaining access to her Grace proved so great , that more than one letter to his brother was written on the subject , in which he indignantly says , “ I am cured of patronage hunting ; as for begging patronage , I am tired to the soul of it , and shall give it up . ” Permission to inscribe the book to the Duchess was at length granted : the book came out in 1803 ; and a copy was transmitted to her , of which , however , no notice whatever was taken .</p>
   <p>On the publication of the volume , a copy was sent to each Review , with a letter deprecatory of the severity of criticism , an act as ill judged as it was useless , since all that a young writer could properly say was to be found in the preface , in which he stated that his inducement to publish was , “ the facilitation through its means of those studies which , from his earliest infancy , have been the principal objects of his ambition , and the increase of the capacity to pursue these inclinations , which may one day place him in an honourable station in the scale of society . ”</p>
   <p>His feelings received a severe wound from the notice of his Poems in the Monthly Review , the writer of which , not satisfied with saying that the production did not “ justify any sanguine expectations , ” selected four of the worst lines in support of his opinion , and showed himself insensible of the numerous beauties scattered through the various pieces . Writing to a friend soon afterwards , he thus spoke of himself ; and more mental wretchedness has seldom been described :</p>
   <p>“ I am at present under afflictions and contentions of spirit , heavier than I have yet ever experienced . I think , at times , I am mad , and destitute of religion ; my pride is not yet subdued : the unfavourable review ( in the ‘ Monthly ’ ) of my unhappy work , has cut deeper than you could have thought ; not in a literary point of view , but as it affects my respectability . It represents me actually as a beggar , going about gathering money to put myself at college , when my book is worthless ; and this with every appearance of candour . They have been sadly misinformed respecting me : this review goes before me wherever I turn my steps ; it haunts me incessantly , and I am persuaded it is an instrument in the hand of Satan to drive me to distraction . I must leave Nottingham . If the answer of the Elland Society be unfavourable , I purpose writing to the Marquis of Wellesley , to offer myself as a student at the academy he has instituted at Fort William , in Bengal , and at the proper age to take orders there . The missionaries at that place have done wonders already ; and I should , I hope , be a valuable labourer in the vineyard . If the Marquis take no notice of my application , or do not accede to my proposal , I shall place myself in some other way of making a meet preparation for the holy office , either in the Calvinistic Academy , or in one of the Scotch Universities , where I shall be able to live at scarcely any expense . ”</p>
   <p>The criticism just adverted to was as unfeeling as unjust ; and but for the generous conduct of a distinguished living poet , whose benevolence of heart is equal to his genius , it might have entirely crushed his hopes . Disgusted at the injustice of this criticism , Mr. Southey instantly wrote to White , expressing his opinion of the merits of his book , and giving him the encouragement and advice which none was ever more ready or more able to bestow . Thus , an act of cruel folly proved in its consequences the most beneficial of the Poet 's life . His spirits were invigorated by this considerate kindness , and his feelings were expressed in glowing terms :</p>
   <p>“ I dare not say all I feel respecting your opinion of my little volume . The extreme acrimony with which the Monthly Review ( of all others the most important ) treated me , threw me into a state of stupefaction . I regarded all that had passed as a dream , and I thought I had been deluding myself into an idea of possessing poetic genius , when , in fact , I had only the longing , without the afflatus . I mustered resolution enough , however , to write spiritedly to them : their answer , in the ensuing number , was a tacit acknowledgment that they had been somewhat too unsparing in their correction . It was a poor attempt to salve over a wound wantonly and most ungenerously inflicted . Still I was damped , because I knew the work was very respectable ; and therefore could not , I concluded , give a criticism grossly deficient in equity , the more especially , as I knew of no sort of inducement to extraordinary severity . Your letter , however , has revived me , and I do again venture to hope that I may still produce something which will survive me . With regard to your advice and offers of assistance , I will not attempt , because I am unable , to thank you for them . To-morrow morning I depart for Cambridge ; and I have considerable hopes that , as I do not enter into the University with any sinister or interested views , but sincerely desire to perform the duties of an affectionate and vigilant pastor , and become more useful to mankind ; I therefore have hopes , I say , that I shall find means of support in the University . If I do not , I shall certainly act in pursuance of your recommendations ; and shall , without hesitation , avail myself of your offers of service , and of your directions . In a short time this will be determined ; and when it is , I shall take the liberty of writing to you at Keswick , to make you acquainted with the result . I have only one objection to publishing by subscription , and I confess it has weight with me ; it is , that , in this step , I shall seem to be acting upon the advice so unfeelingly and contumeliously given by the Monthly Reviewers , who say what is equal to this , that had I gotten a subscription for my poems before their merit was known , I might have succeeded ; provided , it seems , I had made a particular statement of my case ; like a beggar who stands with his hat in one hand , and a full account of his cruel treatment on the coast of Barbary in the other , and so gives you his penny sheet for your sixpence , by way of half purchase , half charity . I have materials for another volume ; but they were written principally while Clifton Grove was in the press , or soon after , and do not now at all satisfy me . Indeed , of late , I have been obliged to desist , almost entirely , from converse with the dames of Helicon . The drudgery of an attorney 's office , and the necessity of preparing myself , in case I should succeed in getting to college , in what little leisure I could boast , left no room for the flights of the imagination . ”</p>
   <p>As soon as there were reasonable hopes of an adequate support being obtained for him at Cambridge , he went to the village of Wilford , for a month , to recruit his health , on which intense application had made great inroads . Near this place were Clifton Woods , the subject of one of his Poems , and which had long been his favourite resort . Here he fully indulged in that love of the beauties of nature , which forms a leading trait in the Poetic character : and on this occasion he gave full reins to those reveries of the imagination , of the delight of which a Poet only is sensible . His lines on Wilford Church Yard show the melancholy tone of his mind ; and those Verses , as well as his “ Ode to Disappointment , ” of which no praise would be too extravagant , appear to have been written , on learning from his mother , before he left Wilford , that the efforts made to place him at Cambridge had failed . It was evidently to this circumstance , which for the time blighted his aspirations , that he alluded , when he says he was ,</p>
   <p>“ From Hope 's summit hurl 'd . ”</p>
   <p>His remark to his mother on this occasion evinced , nevertheless , great energy of mind . His complaints were confined to verse , for the disappointment had no other effect upon his conduct than to induce him to apply to his studies with unprecedented vigour , that , since he was to revert to the law as a profession , he might not be , as he observed , “ a mediocre attorney . ” He read regularly from five in the morning until some time after midnight , and occasionally passed whole nights without lying down ; and the entreaties , even when accompanied by the tears of his mother , that he would not thus destroy his health , did not induce him to relax his zeal .</p>
   <p>Symptoms of consumption , the disease to which he ultimately became a victim , and which he designates , in one of his many allusions to it , as</p>
   <p>“ The most fatal of Pandora 's train , ”</p>
   <p>began now to excite the anxiety of his family . Illness was , however , forgotten in the realization of the hope dearest to his heart . The exertions of his friends proved successful at a time when all expectations had vanished ; and by their united efforts it was resolved that he should become a sizer of St. John 's College , Cambridge , his brother Neville , his mother , and a benevolent individual , whose name is not mentioned , having agreed to contribute to support him . It appears , that if he had not succeeded in that object , he intended to have joined the society of orthodox dissenters , for which purpose he underwent an examination . Though his attainments and character proved satisfactory on that occasion , his volume of Poems rose in judgment against him , and nothing but the approbation Mr. Southey had expressed of them prevented his work from being considered a disqualification for the ministry . His feelings on the prospect of entering the Church are described with great force in his letter , dated in April , 1804 .</p>
   <p>“ Most fervently do I return thanks to God for this providential opening : it has breathed new animation into me , and my breast expands with the prospect of becoming the minister of Christ where I most desired it ; but where I almost feared all probability of success was nearly at an end . Indeed , I had begun to turn my thoughts to the dissenters , as people of whom I was destined , not by choice , but necessity , to become the pastor . Still , although I knew I should be happy anywhere , so that I were a profitable labourer in the vineyard , I did , by no means , feel that calm , that indescribable satisfaction which I do when I look toward that Church , which I think in the main formed on the apostolic model , and from which I am decidedly of opinion there is no positive grounds for dissent . I return thanks to God for keeping me so long in suspense , for I know it has been beneficial to my soul , and I feel a considerable trust that the way is now about to be made clear , and that my doubts and fears on this head will , in due time , be removed . ”</p>
   <p>Being advised to degrade for a year , and to place himself with a private tutor , he went to the Rev . Mr. Grainger of Winteringham , in Lincolnshire , in the autumn of 1804 . While under that gentleman 's care he studied with such intense fervour , that fears were excited not for his health only , but for his intellect ; and a second severe attack of illness was the consequence . Poetry was now laid aside , and as he himself told a friend in February , 1805 ,</p>
   <p>“ My poor neglected Muse has lain absolutely unnoticed by me for the last four months , during which period I have been digging in the mines of Scapula for Greek roots , and instead of drinking with eager delight the beauties of Virgil have been culling and drying his phrases for future use . ” — “ I fear my good genius , who was wont to visit me with nightly visions in woods and brakes and by the river 's marge , is now dying of a fen ague , and I shall thus probably emerge from my retreat not a hair-brained son of imagination , but a sedate black-lettered book worm , with a head like an etymologicon magnum . ”</p>
   <p>To Mr. Capel Lofft , in the September following , after stating that all his time was employed in preparing himself for orders , his estimate of the necessary qualifications being , very high , he observed :</p>
   <p>“ I often , however , cast a look of fond regret to the darling occupations of my younger hours , and the tears rush into my eyes , as I fancy I see the few wild flowers of poetic genius , with which I have been blessed , withering with neglect . Poetry has been to me something more than amusement ; it has been a cheering companion when I have had no other to fly to , and a delightful solace when consolation has been in some measure needful . I cannot , therefore , discard so old and faithful a friend without deep regret , especially when I reflect that , stung by my ingratitude , he may desert me for ever ! ”</p>
   <p>But the old fire was , he adds , rekindled by looking over some of his pieces which Mr. Lofft wished to print ; and he transmitted to that gentleman a short Poem , expressive of his sorrow at taking leave of his favourite pursuit . The following passages could only have arisen from a love of Poetry , which it was not in the power of severer studies to extinguish :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Heart-soothing Poesy ! Though thou hast ceased</l>
     <l n="2">To hover o'er the many voiced strings</l>
     <l n="3">Of my long silent lyre , yet thou canst still</l>
     <l n="4">Call the warm tear from its thrice hallow 'd cell ,</l>
     <l n="5">And with recalled images of bliss</l>
     <l n="6">Warm my reluctant heart . Yes , I would throw ,</l>
     <l n="7">Once more would throw , a quick and hurried hand</l>
     <l n="8">O'er the responding chords . It hath not ceased ,</l>
     <l n="9">It cannot , will not cease ; the heavenly warmth</l>
     <l n="10">Plays round my heart , and mantles o'er my cheek ;</l>
     <l n="11">Still , though unbidden , plays . Fair Poesy !</l>
     <l n="12">The summer and the spring , the wind and rain ,</l>
     <l n="13">Sunshine and storm , with various interchange ,</l>
     <l n="14">Have mark 'd full many a day , and week , and month ,</l>
     <l n="15">Since by dark wood , or hamlet far retired ,</l>
     <l n="16">Spell-struck , with thee I loiter 'd . Sorceress !</l>
     <l n="17">I cannot burst thy bonds !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In October , 1805 , Kirke White became a resident member of St. John 's College , Cambridge ; and such was the use he had made of his time at Winteringham , that he was distinguished for his classical knowledge . But he had dearly purchased his superiority . His constitution was much shattered when he went to Mr. Grainger , and every day brought with it new proofs that his career had nearly reached its bounds . The only chance of prolonging his life was to seek a milder climate , and to abandon study entirely . As in all great minds , Fame was , however , dearer to him than existence . He felt that every thing connected with his future prospects was at stake ; and he adhered to a course of rigorous application until nature gave way . During his first term he became a candidate for one of the University scholarships ; but the increased exertion he underwent was attended by results that obliged him to retire from the contest . At this moment the general college examination approached , and thinking that if he failed his hopes would be blasted for ever , he taxed his energies to the uttermost , during the fortnight which intervened , to meet the trial . His illness , however , speedily returned ; and , with tears in his eyes , he informed his tutor , Mr. Catton , that he could not go into the Hall to be examined . That gentleman , whose kindness to the Poet entitles his name to respect , urged him to support himself during the six days of the examination . Powerful stimulants were administered , and he was pronounced the first man of his year . The triumph , complete and exhilarating as it was , too closely resembled that of the generous steed , who , in distancing his competitors , reaches the goal , and dies ; and his own ideas of the sacrifices with which such an honour must be attended were very poetical . He said to an intimate friend , almost the last time he saw him , that were he to paint a picture of Fame crowning a distinguished under graduate after the senate house examination , he would represent her as concealing a death 's head under a mask of beauty .</p>
   <p>Soon after this event , Kirke White went to London , and on Christmas Eve he wrote to his mother from town , stating that his health had been rather affected by study , that he came to London for amusement , and that his tutor had , in the kindest manner , relieved his mind from pecuniary cares , and cheered him with the assurance that his talents would be rewarded by his College . But it is from his letters to his friend that the real state to which excitement and labour had reduced him , is to be learnt , because , to allay the fears of his relations , he represented himself to them , as being much better than he actually was :</p>
   <p>London , Christmas , 1805 .</p>
   <p>“ I wrote you a letter , which now lies in my drawer at St. John 's ; but in such a weak state of body , and in so desponding and comfortless a tone of mind , that I knew it would give you pain , and therefore I chose not to send it . I have indeed been ill ; but thanks to God , I am recovered . My nerves were miserably shattered by over application , and the absence of all that could amuse , and the presence of many things which weighed heavy upon my spirits . When I found myself too ill to read , and too desponding to endure my own reflections , I discovered that it is really a miserable thing to be destitute of the soothing and supporting hand when nature most needs it . I wandered up and down from one man 's room to another , and from one College to another , imploring society , a little conversation , and a little relief of the burden which pressed upon my spirits ; and I am sorry to say , that those who , when I was cheerful and lively , sought my society with avidity , now , when I actually needed conversation , were too busy to grant it . Our College examination was then approaching , and I perceived with anguish that I had read for the university scholarship until I had barely time to get up our private subjects , and that as I was now too ill to read , all hope of getting through the examination with decent respectability was at an end . This was an additional grief . I went to our tutor , with tears in my eyes , and told him I must absent myself from the examination ,— a step which would have precluded me from a station amongst the prize-men until the second year . He earnestly entreated me to run the risk . My surgeon gave me strong stimulants and supporting medicines during the examination week ; and I passed , I believe , one of the most respectable examinations amongst them . As soon as ever it was over , I left Cambridge , by the advice of my surgeon and tutor , and I feel myself now pretty strong . I have given up the thought of sitting for the University scholarship , in consequence of my illness , as the course of my reading was effectually broken . In this place I have been much amused , and have been received with an attention in the literary circles which I neither expected nor deserved . But this does not affect me as it once would have done : my views are widely altered ; and I hope that I shall in time learn to lay my whole heart at the foot of the cross . ”</p>
   <p>Early in January following he returned to Cambridge , and imprudently resumed his old habits of study , according to the following plan : “ Rise at half-past five ; devotions and walk till seven ; chapel and breakfast till eight ; study and lectures till one ; four and a half clear reading ; walk , &amp; c. and dinner , and Wollaston , and chapel to six ; six to nine reading , three hours ; nine to ten devotions ; bed at ten . ” With him , however , exercise was but slight relaxation , as his intellectual faculties were kept on the stretch during his walks , and he is known to have committed to memory a whole tragedy of Euripides in this manner , and as they were not less exerted in his devotions , his mind must have been intensely occupied for twelve or fourteen hours a day , at a moment when perfect quiet and rest were indispensable . Within a very few weeks he paid a heavy penalty for his indiscretion . To his friend , Mr. Haddock , he wrote on the 17th of February , 1806 :</p>
   <p>“ Do not think I am reading hard ; I believe it is all over with that . I have had a recurrence of my old complaint within this last four or five days , which has half unnerved me for every thing . The state of my health is really miserable ; I am well and lively in the morning , and overwhelmed with nervous horrors in the evening . I do not know how to proceed with regard to my studies :— a very slight overstretch of the mind in the daytime occasions me not only a sleepless night , but a night of gloom and horror . The systole and diastole of my heart seem to be playing at ball — the stake , my life . I can only say the game is not yet decided :— I allude to the violence of the palpitation . I am going to mount the Gog-magog hills this morning , in quest of a good night 's sleep . The Gog-magog hills for my body , and the Bible for my mind , are my only medicines . I am sorry to say , that neither are quite adequate . Cui , igitur ; dandum est vitio ? Mihi prorsus . I hope , as the summer comes , my spirits ( which have been with the swallows , a winter 's journey ) will come with it . When my spirits are restored , my health will be restored :— the ‘ fons mali ’ lies there . Give me serenity and equability of mind , and all will be well . ”</p>
   <p>He , however , rallied again ; but he seems to have been aware that his end was not far distant , for in March he told his brother that though his stay at Cambridge , in the long vacation , was important , he intended to go to Nottingham for his health , and more particularly for his mother 's sake ; adding , “ I shall be glad to moor all my family in the harbour of religious trust , and in the calm seas of religious peace . These concerns are apt at times to escape me ; but they now press much upon my heart , and I think it is my first duty to see that my family are safe in the most important of all affairs . ”</p>
   <p>In April , however , he drew a pleasing picture of his future life , in which his filial and paternal tenderness are conspicuous ; but he soon afterwards went to Nottingham ; and in a letter to his friend Mr. Leeson , written from that town , on the 7th of April , he gave a very melancholy account of himself :</p>
   <p>“ It seems determined upon , by my mother , that I cannot be spared , since the time of my stay is so very short , and my health so very uncertain . The people here can scarcely be persuaded that any thing ails me ; so well do I look ; but occasional depressions , especially after any thing has occurred to occasion uneasiness , still harass me . My mind is of a very peculiar cast . I began to think too early ; and the indulgence of certain trains of thought , and too free an exercise of the imagination , have superinduced a morbid kind of sensibility ; which is to the mind what excessive irritability is to the body . Some circumstances occurred on my arrival at Nottingham , which gave me just cause for inquietude and anxiety ; the consequences were insomnia , and a relapse into causeless dejections . It is my business now to curb these irrational and immoderate affections , and , by accustoming myself to sober thought and cool reasoning , to restrain these freaks and vagaries of the fancy , and redundancies of [ Greek : melancholia ] . When I am well , I cannot help entertaining a sort of contempt for the weakness of mind which marks my indispositions . Titus when well , and Titus when ill , are two distinct persons . The man , when in health , despises the man , when ill , for his weakness , and the latter envies the former for his felicity . ”</p>
   <p>As his health declined his prospects seemed to brighten . He was again pronounced first at the great College examination ; he was one of the three best theme writers , whose merits were so nearly equal that the examiners could not decide between them ; and he was a prize-man both in the mathematical and logical or general examination , and in Latin composition . His College offered him a private tutor at its expense , and Mr. Catton obtained exhibitions for him to the value of sixty-six pounds per annum , by which he was enabled to give up the pecuniary assistance he had received from his friends . But even at this moment , when the world promised so much , his situation was truly deplorable . The highest honours of the University were supposed to be within his grasp , and the conviction that such was the general opinion , goaded him on to the most strenuous exertions when he was incapable of the slightest . This struggle between his mental and physical powers , was not , however , of long duration . In July he was seized with an attack that threatened his life , and which he thus described in a letter to Mr. Maddock :</p>
   <p>“ Last Saturday morning I rose early , and got up some rather abstruse problems in mechanics for my tutor , spent an hour with him , between eight and nine got my breakfast , and read the Greek History ( at breakfast ) till ten , then sat down to decipher some logarithm tables . I think I had not done any thing at them , when I lost myself . At a quarter past eleven my laundress found me bleeding in four different places in my face and head , and insensible . I got up and staggered about the room , and she , being frightened , ran away , and told my gyp to fetch a surgeon . Before he came I was sallying out with my flannel gown on , and my academical gown over it ; he made me put on my coat , and then I went to Mr. Farish 's : he opened a vein , and my recollection returned . My own idea was , that I had fallen out of bed , and so I told Mr. Farish at first ; but I afterwards remembered that I had been to Mr. Fiske , and breakfasted . Mr. Catton has insisted on my consulting Sir Isaac Pennington , and the consequence is , that I am to go through a course of blistering , &amp; c. which , after the bleeding , will leave me weak enough .</p>
   <p>“ I am , however , very well , except as regards the doctors , and yesterday I drove into the country to Saffron Walden , in a gig . My tongue is in a bad condition , from a bite which I gave it either in my fall , or in the moments of convulsion . My nose has also come badly off . I believe I fell against my reading desk . My other wounds are only rubs and scratches on the carpet . I am ordered to remit my studies for a while , by the common advice both of doctors and tutors . Dr. Pennington hopes to prevent any recurrence of the fit . He thinks it looks towards epilepsy , of the horrors of which malady I have a very full and precise idea ; and I only pray that God will spare me as respects my faculties , however else it may seem good to him to afflict me . Were I my own master , I know how I should act ; but I am tied here by bands which I cannot burst . I know that change of place is needful ; but I must not indulge in the idea . The college must not pay my tutor for nothing . Dr. Pennington and Mr. Farish attribute the attack to a too continued tension of the faculties . As I am much alone now , I never get quite off study , and I think incessantly . I know nature will not endure this . They both proposed my going home , but Mr. * * did not hint at it , although much concerned ; and , indeed , I know home would be a bad place for me in my present situation . I look round for a resting place , and I find none . Yet there is one , which I have long too , too much disregarded , and thither I must now betake myself . There are many situations worse than mine , and I have no business to complain . If these afflictions should draw the bonds tighter which hold me to my Redeemer , it will be well . You may be assured that you have here a plain statement of my case in its true colours without any palliation . I am now well again , and have only to fear a relapse , which I shall do all I can to prevent , by a relaxation in study . I have now written too much .</p>
   <p>“ I am , very sincerely yours ,</p>

     <l n="1">“ P. S. I charge you , as you value my peace , not to let my friends</l>
     <l n="2">hear , either directly or indirectly of my illness . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>A few weeks afterwards he again directed his mother 's hopes to a tranquil retreat for his family in his parsonage , but said nothing of his illness ; and he told Mr. Haddock , in September ,</p>
   <p>“ I am perfectly well again , and have experienced no recurrence of the fit : my spirits , too , are better , and I read very moderately . I hope that God will be pleased to spare his rebellious child ; this stroke has brought me nearer to Him ; whom indeed have I for my comforter but Him ? I am still reading , but with moderation , as I have been during the whole vacation , whatever you may persist in thinking . My heart turns with more fondness towards the consolations of religion than it did , and in some degree I have found consolation . ”</p>
   <p>But notwithstanding these flattering expressions , he appears to have felt that he had but a short time to live ; and it was probably about this period that he wrote his lines on the “ Prospect of Death , ” perhaps one of the most beautiful and affecting compositions in our language :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ On my bed , in wakeful restlessness ,</l>
     <l n="2">I turn me wearisome ; while all around ,</l>
     <l n="3">All , all , save me , sink in forgetfulness ;</l>
     <l n="4">I only wake to watch the sickly taper</l>
     <l n="5">Which lights me to my tomb .— Yes , ‘ tis the hand</l>
     <l n="6">Of Death I feel press heavy on my vitals ,</l>
     <l n="7">Slow sapping the warm current of existence</l>
     <l n="8">My moments now are few — the sand of life</l>
     <l n="9">Ebbs fastly to its finish . Yet a little ,</l>
     <l n="10">And the last fleeting particle will fall ,</l>
     <l n="11">Silent , unseen , unnoticed , unlamented .</l>
     <l n="12">Come then , sad Thought , and let us meditate</l>
     <l n="13">While meditate we may .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="14">I hoped I should not leave</l>
     <l n="15">The earth without a vestige ; Fate decrees</l>
     <l n="16">It shall be otherwise , and I submit .</l>
     <l n="17">Henceforth , O world , no more of thy desires !</l>
     <l n="18">No more of Hope ! the wanton vagrant Hope ;</l>
     <l n="19">I abjure all . Now other cares engross me ,</l>
     <l n="20">And my tired soul , with emulative haste ,</l>
     <l n="21">Looks to its God , and prunes its wings for Heaven . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>On the 22nd of September he wrote to Mr. Charlesworth , and his letter indicates the possession of higher spirits and more sanguine hopes , than almost any other in his correspondence . About the end of that month he went to London , on a visit to his brother Neville , but returned to College within a few weeks , in a state that precluded all chance of prolonging his existence ; but still he did not cease to hope , or rather sought to delude his brother into the belief that he should recover ; for in a letter addressed to him , which was found in his pocket after his decease , dated Saturday , 11th of October , he says ,</p>
   <p>“ I am safely arrived , and in College , but my illness has increased upon me much . The cough continues , and is attended with a good deal of fever . I am under the care of Mr. Parish , and entertain very little apprehension about the cough ; but my over-exertions in town have reduced me to a state of much debility ; and , until the cough be gone , I cannot be permitted to take any strengthening medicines . This places me in an awkward predicament ; but I think I perceive a degree of expectoration this morning , which will soon relieve me , and then I shall mend apace . Under these circumstances I must not expect to see you here at present ; when I am a little recovered , it will be a pleasant relaxation to me . Our lectures began on Friday , but I do not attend them until I am better . I have not written to my mother , nor shall I while I remain unwell . You will tell her , as a reason , that our lectures began on Friday . I know she will be uneasy if she do not hear from me , and still more so , if I tell her I am ill .</p>
   <p>“ I cannot write more at present than that I am</p>
   <p>“ Your truly affectionate Brother ,</p>
   <p>“ H. K. WHITE . ”</p>
   <p>A friend acquainted his brother with his situation , who hastened to him ; but when he arrived he was delirious , and though reason returned for a few moments , as if to bless him with the consciousness that the same fond relative , to whose attachment he owed so much , was present at his last hour , he sunk into a stupor , and on Sunday , the 19th of October , 1806 , he breathed his last .</p>
   <p>Thus died , in his twenty-second year , Henry Kirke White , whose genius and virtues justified the brightest hopes , and whose fitness for Heaven does not bring the consolation for his untimely fate which perhaps it ought . It is impossible to refrain from anticipating what his talents might have produced , had his existence been extended ; and though it is extremely doubtful if he were capable of worldly happiness , there is a selfishness in our nature which makes us grieve when those who are likely to increase our intellectual pleasures are hurried to the grave .</p>
   <p>In whatever light the character of this unhappy youth be contemplated , it is full of instruction . His talents were unusually precocious , and their variety was as astonishing as their extent . Besides the Poetical pieces in this volume , and his scholastic attainments , his ability was manifested in various other ways . His style was remarkable for its clearness and elegance , and his correspondence and prose pieces show extensive information . To great genius and capacity , he united the rarest and more important gifts of sound judgment and common sense . It is usually the misfortune of genius to invest ordinary objects with a meretricious colouring , that perverts their forms and purposes , to make its possessor imagine that it exempts him from attending to those strict rules of moral conduct to which others are bound to adhere , and to render him neglectful of the sacred assurance that “ to whom much is given from him will much be required . ” Nature , in Kirke White 's case , appears , on the contrary , to have determined that she would , in one instance at least , prove that high intellectual attainments are strictly compatible with every social and moral virtue . At a very early period of his life , religion became the predominant feeling of his mind , and she imparted her sober and chastened effects to all his thoughts and actions . The cherished object of every member of his family , he repaid their affection by the most anxious solicitude for their welfare , offering his advice on spiritual affairs with impressive earnestness , and indicating , in every letter of his voluminous correspondence , the greatest consideration for their feelings and happiness . For the last six years he deemed himself marked out for the service of his Maker , not like the member of a convent , whose duties consist only in prayer , but in the exercise of that philanthropy and practical benevolence which ought to adorn every parish priest . To qualify himself properly for the holy office , he subjected his mind to the severest discipline ; and his letters display a rational piety , and an enlightened view of religious obligations , that confer much greater honour upon his name , than his Poetical pieces , whether as proofs of talent , or of the qualities of his heart .</p>
   <p>Such was Henry Kirke White as he appeared to others ; but there are minuter traits of character which no observer can catch , and which the possessor must himself delineate . Though early impressed with melancholy , it was not of a misanthropic nature ; and while despair and disappointment were preying on his heart , he was all sweetness and docility to others . A consciousness of the possession of abilities , and of being capable of better things than those which he seemed destined to perform , gives to some of his productions the appearance of discontent , and of having overrated his pretensions . He was , like many youthful Poets , too fond of complaining of fortune , of supposing himself neglected , and of comparing his humble lot with those situations for which he believed himself qualified ; but these were the lucubrations of his earliest years , before he found friends to foster his talents . So far , indeed , from having reason to lament the indifference of others to his merits , his life affords one of the most striking examples in the history of genius , that talents when united to moral worth , will be rewarded by honours and fame , that obscure birth is no impediment to advancement , and that a person of the humblest origin may , by his own exertions , become , in the great arena of learning , an object of envy even to those of the highest rank . It is due to him , whose good sense was so remarkable , to point out the time in his career to which the passages in question refer ; and to add that his correspondence , after he entered the University , expressed nothing but satisfaction with his lot , and a desire to justify the kindness and expectations of his patrons . Still , Kirke White was unhappy ; and , since no other cause then existed for his mental wretchedness , it must be ascribed to a morbid temperament , induced partly by ill health , and partly by constitutional infirmity . The uncertainty of his early prospects , and the fear of ridicule if he expressed his feelings , rendered him reserved , and made him confine his thoughts to his own bosom , for he says ,</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ When all was new , and life was in its spring ,</l>
     <l n="2">I lived an unloved solitary thing ;</l>
     <l n="3">E'en then I learn 'd to bury deep from day</l>
     <l n="4">The piercing cares that wore my youth away ; ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">and in a letter to Mr. Maddock , in September , 1804 , he thus spoke</l>
     <l n="6">of himself :</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Perhaps it may be that I am not formed for friendship , that I expect more than can ever be found . Time will tutor me ; I am a singular being under a common outside : I am a profound dissembler of my inward feelings , and necessity has taught me the art . I am long before I can unbosom to a friend , yet , I think , I am sincere in my friendship : you must not attribute this to any suspiciousness of nature , but must consider that I lived seventeen years my own confidant , my own friend , full of projects and strange thoughts , and confiding them to no one . I am habitually reserved , and habitually cautious in letting it be seen that I hide any thing . ”</p>
   <p>None knew better than himself that the aspirations and feelings of which genius is the parent are often found to be inconsistent with felicity :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Oh ! hear the plaint by thy sad favourite made ,</l>
     <l n="2">His melancholy moan ,</l>
     <l n="3">He tells of scorn , he tells of broken vows ,</l>
     <l n="4">Of sleepless nights , of anguish-ridden days ,</l>
     <l n="5">Pangs that his sensibility uprouse</l>
     <l n="6">To curse his being and his thirst for praise .</l>
     <l n="7">Thou gavest to him with treble force to feel</l>
     <l n="8">The sting of keen neglect , the rich man 's scorn ;</l>
     <l n="9">And what o'er all does in his soul preside</l>
     <l n="10">Predominant , and tempers him to steel ,</l>
     <l n="11">His high indignant pride . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Nor was he unconscious that the toils necessary to secure literary distinction , when endured by a shattered frame , are in the highest degree severe . How much truth and feeling are there in the Lines which he wrote after spending a whole night in study , an hour when religious impressions force themselves with irresistible weight on the exhausted mind :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Oh ! when reflecting on these truths sublime ,</l>
     <l n="2">How insignificant do all the joys ,</l>
     <l n="3">The gaudes , and honours of the world appear !</l>
     <l n="4">How vain ambition !— Why has my wakeful lamp</l>
     <l n="5">Out watch 'd the slow-paced night ?— Why on the page ,</l>
     <l n="6">The schoolman 's labour 'd page , have I employ 'd</l>
     <l n="7">The hours devoted by the world to rest ,</l>
     <l n="8">And needful to recruit exhausted nature ?</l>
     <l n="9">Say , can the voice of narrow Fame repay</l>
     <l n="10">The loss of health ? or can the hope of glory</l>
     <l n="11">Lend a new throb unto my languid heart ,</l>
     <l n="12">Cool , even now , my feverish aching brow ,</l>
     <l n="13">Relume the fires of this deep sunken eye ,</l>
     <l n="14">Or paint new colours on this pallid cheek ? ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>What a picture of mental suffering does the following passage present , and how impressive does it become when the fate of the author is remembered :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ These feverish dews that on my temples hang ,</l>
     <l n="2">This quivering lip , these eyes of dying flame ;</l>
     <l n="3">These , the dread signs of many a secret pang —</l>
     <l n="4">These are the meed of him who pants for Fame ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Like so many other ardent students , the night was his favourite time for reading ; and , dangerous as the habit is to health , what student will not agree in his descriptions of the pleasures that attend it ?</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The night 's my own , they cannot steal my night !</l>
     <l n="2">When evening lights her folding star on high ,</l>
     <l n="3">I live and breathe ; and , in the sacred hours</l>
     <l n="4">Of quiet and repose , my spirit flies ,</l>
     <l n="5">Free as the morning , o'er the realms of space ,</l>
     <l n="6">And mounts the skies , and imps her wing for heaven . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Kirke White 's poetry is popular , because it describes feelings , passions , and associations , which all have felt , and with which all can sympathize . It is by no means rich in metaphor , nor does it evince great powers of imagination ; but it is pathetic , plaintive , and agreeable ; and emanating directly from his own heart , it appeals irresistibly to that of his reader . His meaning is always clear , and the force and vigour of his expressions are remarkable . In estimating his poetical powers , however , it should be remembered , that nearly all his Poems were written before he was nineteen ; and that they are , in truth , but the germs of future excellence , and ought not to be criticized as if they were the fruits of an intellect on which time and education had bestowed their advantages . It is , however , in his prose works , and especially in his correspondence , that the versatility of his talents , his acquirements , his piety , and his moral excellence are most conspicuous .</p>
   <p>A question arises with respect to him which , in the history of a young Poet , is always interesting , but which Mr. Southey has not touched . Abundance of proof exists in his writings of the susceptibility of his heart ; but it is not stated that he ever formed an attachment . In many of his pieces he speaks with tenderness of a female whom he calls Fanny ; and in one of them , from which it appears that she was dead , he expresses his regard in no equivocal manner ; but there are other grounds for concluding that his happiness was affected by disappointed affection . To his friend Mr. Maddock , in July , 1804 , he observed :</p>
   <p>“ I shall never , never marry . It cannot , must not be . As to affections , mine are already engaged as much as they ever will be , and this is one reason why I believe my life will be a life of celibacy . I love too ardently to make love innocent , and therefore I say farewell to it . ”</p>
   <p>With this passage one of his Sonnets singularly agrees :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">When I sit musing on the chequer 'd past</l>
     <l n="2">( A term much darken 'd with untimely woes ) ,</l>
     <l n="3">My thoughts revert to her , for whom still flows</l>
     <l n="4">The tear , though half disowned ; and binding fast</l>
     <l n="5">Pride 's stubborn cheat to my too yielding heart ,</l>
     <l n="6">I say to her , she robb 'd me of my rest ,</l>
     <l n="7">When that was all my wealth . ‘ T is true my breast</l>
     <l n="8">Received from her this wearying , lingering smart ;</l>
     <l n="9">Yet , ah ! I cannot bid her form depart ;</l>
     <l n="10">Though wrong 'd , I love her — yet in anger love ,</l>
     <l n="11">For she was most unworthy . Then I prove</l>
     <l n="12">Vindictive joy : and on my stern front gleams ,</l>
     <l n="13">Throned in dark clouds , inflexible ....</l>
     <l n="14">The native pride of my much injured heart .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Was the subject of this Sonnet wholly imaginary , or was there some unfortunate story which , for sufficient reasons , his biographers have suppressed ? It is true , that in his letters , written at a much later period , he speaks of marriage in a manner not to be reconciled with the idea that he was then suffering from recollections of that description ; but he may , in the interval of two years , have partially recovered from his loss .</p>
   <p>Kirke White was buried in the Church of All Saints , Cambridge , but no monument was erected to him until a liberal minded American , Mr. Francis Boott , of Boston , placed a tablet to his memory , with a medallion , by Chantrey , with the following inscription , by Professor Smyth , one of his numerous friends :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Warm 'd with fond hope and learning 's sacred flame ,</l>
     <l n="2">To Granta 's bowers the youthful Poet came ;</l>
     <l n="3">Unconquer 'd powers the immortal mind display 'd ,</l>
     <l n="4">But worn with anxious thought , the frame decay 'd :</l>
     <l n="5">Pale o'er his lamp , and in his cell retired ,</l>
     <l n="6">The martyr student faded and expired .</l>
     <l n="7">Oh ! genius , taste , and piety sincere ,</l>
     <l n="8">Too early lost ‘ midst studies too severe !</l>
     <l n="9">Foremost to mourn , was generous Southey seen ,</l>
     <l n="10">He told the tale , and show 'd what White had been ,</l>
     <l n="11">Nor told in vain . For o'er the Atlantic wave</l>
     <l n="12">A wanderer came , and sought the Poet 's grave ;</l>
     <l n="13">On yon low stone he saw his lonely name ,</l>
     <l n="14">And raised this fond memorial to his fame . ”</l>

    <head>DEDICATION .</head>
    <head>To Her Grace the Duchess of Devonshire , the following trifling effusions of a very youthful Muse are , by permission , dedicated by her Grace 's much obliged and grateful Servant ,</head>
    <head>HENRY KIRKE WHITE</head>
     <l n="1">Nottingham .</l>

   <p>PREFACE .</p>
   <p>The following attempts in Verse are laid before the Public with extreme diffidence . The Author is very conscious that the juvenile efforts of a youth , who has not received the polish of Academical discipline , and who has been but sparingly blessed with opportunities for the prosecution of scholastic pursuits , must necessarily be defective in the accuracy and finished elegance which mark the works of the man who has passed his life in the retirement of his study , furnishing his mind with images , and at the same time attaining the power of disposing those images to the best advantage .</p>
   <p>The unpremeditated effusions of a Boy , from his thirteenth year , employed , not in the acquisition of literary information , but in the more active business of life , must not be expected to exhibit any considerable portion of the correctness of a Virgil , or the vigorous compression of a Horace . Men are not , I believe , frequently known to bestow much , labour on their amusements ; and these poems were , most of them , written merely to beguile a leisure hour , or to fill up the languid intervals of studies of a severer nature .</p>
   <p>[ Greek : Pas to oicheios ergon agapao ] , “ Every one loves his own work , ” says Stagyrite ; but it was no overweening affection of this kind which induced this publication . Had the author relied on his own judgment only , these Poems would not , in all probability , ever have seen the light .</p>
   <p>Perhaps it may be asked of him , what are his motives for this publication ? He answers — simply these : The facilitation , through its means , of those studies which , from his earliest infancy , have been the principal objects of his ambition ; and the increase of the capacity to pursue those inclinations which may one day place him in an honourable station in the scale of society .</p>
   <p>The principal Poem in this little collection ( Clifton Grove ) is , he fears , deficient in numbers and harmonious coherency of parts . It is , however , merely to be regarded as a description of a nocturnal ramble in that charming retreat , accompanied with such reflections as the scene naturally suggested . It was written twelve months ago , when the Author was in his sixteenth year :— The Miscellanies are some of them the productions of a very early age .— Of the Odes , that “ To an early Primrose ” was written at thirteen — the others are of a later date .— The Sonnets are chiefly irregular ; they have , perhaps , no other claim to that specific denomination , than that they consist only of fourteen lines .</p>
   <p>Such are the Poems towards which I entreat the lenity of the Public . The Critic will doubtless find in them much to condemn ; he may likewise possibly discover something to commend . Let him scan my faults with an indulgent eye , and in the work of that correction which I invite , let him remember he is holding the iron Mace of Criticism over the flimsy superstructure of a youth of seventeen ; and , remembering that , may he forbear from crushing , by too much rigour , the painted butterfly whose transient colours may otherwise be capable of affording a moment 's innocent amusement .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Lo ! in the west , fast fades the lingering light ,</l>
     <l n="2">And day 's last vestige takes its silent flight .</l>
     <l n="3">No more is heard the woodman 's measured stroke ,</l>
     <l n="4">Which with the dawn from yonder dingle broke ;</l>
     <l n="5">No more , hoarse clamouring o'er the uplifted head ,</l>
     <l n="6">The crows assembling seek their wind-rock 'd bed ;</l>
     <l n="7">Still 'd is the village hum — the woodland sounds</l>
     <l n="8">Have ceased to echo o'er the dewy grounds ,</l>
     <l n="9">And general silence reigns , save when below</l>
     <l n="10">The murmuring Trent is scarcely heard to flow ;</l>
     <l n="11">And save when , swung by ‘ nighted rustic late ,</l>
     <l n="12">Oft , on its hinge , rebounds the jarring gate ;</l>
     <l n="13">Or when the sheep-bell , in the distant vale ,</l>
     <l n="14">Breathes its wild music on the downy gale .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="15">Now , when the rustic wears the social smile ,</l>
     <l n="16">Released from day and its attendant toil ,</l>
     <l n="17">And draws his household round their evening fire ,</l>
     <l n="18">And tells the ofttold tales that never tire ;</l>
     <l n="19">Or , where the town 's blue turrets dimly rise ,</l>
     <l n="20">And manufacture taints the ambient skies ,</l>
     <l n="21">The pale mechanic leaves the labouring loom ,</l>
     <l n="22">The air-pent hold , the pestilential room ,</l>
     <l n="23">And rushes out , impatient to begin</l>
     <l n="24">The stated course of customary sin :</l>
     <l n="25">Now , now my solitary way I bend</l>
     <l n="26">Where solemn groves in awful state impend :</l>
     <l n="27">And cliffs , that boldly rise above the plain ,</l>
     <l n="28">Bespeak , bless 'd Clifton ! thy sublime domain .</l>
     <l n="29">Here lonely wandering o'er the sylvan bower ,</l>
     <l n="30">I come to pass the meditative hour ;</l>
     <l n="31">To bid awhile the strife of passion cease ,</l>
     <l n="32">And woo the calms of solitude and peace .</l>
     <l n="33">And oh ! thou sacred Power , who rear'st on high</l>
     <l n="34">Thy leafy throne where wavy poplars sigh !</l>
     <l n="35">Genius of woodland shades ! whose mild control</l>

Who , when stunned and confused ye lay on the burning lake , who first awoke , and collected your scattered powers ? Lastly , who led you across the unfathomable abyss to this delightful world , and established that reign here which now totters to its base ? How , therefore , dares yon treacherous fiend to cast a stain on Satan 's bravery ? he who preys only on the defenceless — who sucks the blood of infants , and delights only in acts of ignoble cruelty and unequal contention . Away with the boaster who never joins in action , but , like a cormorant , hovers over the field , to feed upon the wounded , and overwhelm the dying . True bravery is as remote from rashness as from hesitation ; let us counsel coolly , but let us execute our counselled purposes determinately . In power we have learned , by that experiment which lost us Heaven , that we are inferior to the Thunder-bearer :— In subtlety , in subtlety alone we are his equals . Open war is impossible .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Down the sultry arc of day</l>
     <l n="2">The burning wheels have urged their way ;</l>
     <l n="3">And eve along the western skies</l>
     <l n="4">Sheds her intermingling dyes .</l>
     <l n="5">Down the deep , the miry lane ,</l>
     <l n="6">Creaking comes the empty wain ,</l>
     <l n="7">And driver on the shaft-horse sits ,</l>
     <l n="8">Whistling now and then by fits :</l>
     <l n="9">And oft , with his accustom 'd call ,</l>
     <l n="10">Urging on the sluggish Ball .</l>
     <l n="11">The barn is still , the master 's gone ,</l>
     <l n="12">And thresher puts his jacket on ,</l>
     <l n="13">While Dick , upon the ladder tall ,</l>
     <l n="14">Nails the dead kite to the wall .</l>
     <l n="15">Here comes shepherd Jack at last ,</l>
     <l n="16">He has penn 'd the sheepcote fast ,</l>
     <l n="17">For ‘ t was but two nights before ,</l>
     <l n="18">A lamb was eaten on the moor :</l>
     <l n="19">His empty wallet Rover carries ,</l>
     <l n="20">Nor for Jack , when near home , tarries .</l>
     <l n="21">With lolling tongue he runs to try</l>
     <l n="22">If the horse-trough be not dry .</l>
     <l n="23">The milk is settled in the pans ,</l>
     <l n="24">And supper messes in the cans ;</l>
     <l n="25">In the hovel carts are wheel 'd ,</l>
     <l n="26">And both the colts are drove a-field ;</l>
     <l n="27">The horses are all bedded up ,</l>
     <l n="28">And the ewe is with the tup .</l>
     <l n="29">The snare for Mister Fox is set ,</l>
     <l n="30">The leaven laid , the thatching wet ,</l>
     <l n="31">And Bess has slink 'd away to talk</l>
     <l n="32">With Roger in the holly walk .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="33">Now , on the settle all , but Bess ,</l>

     <l n="36">Are swinging on the meadow gate .</l>
     <l n="37">Now they chat of various things ,</l>
     <l n="38">Of taxes , ministers , and kings ,</l>
     <l n="39">Or else tell all the village news ,</l>
     <l n="40">How madam did the squire refuse ;</l>
     <l n="41">How parson on his tithes was bent ,</l>
     <l n="42">And landlord oft distrain 'd for rent .</l>
     <l n="43">Thus do they talk , till in the sky</l>
     <l n="44">The pale-eyed moon is mounted high ,</l>
     <l n="45">And from the alehouse drunken Ned</l>
     <l n="46">Had reel 'd — then hasten all to bed .</l>
     <l n="47">The mistress sees that lazy Kate</l>
     <l n="48">The happing coal on kitchen grate</l>
     <l n="49">Has laid — while master goes throughout ,</l>
     <l n="50">Sees shutters fast , the mastiff out ,</l>
     <l n="51">The candles safe , the hearths all clear ,</l>
     <l n="52">And nought from thieves or fire to fear ;</l>

    <head>WRITTEN IN THE PROSPECT OF DEATH .</head>
     <l n="1">Sad solitary Thought , who keep'st thy vigils .</l>
     <l n="2">Thy solemn vigils , in the sick man 's mind ;</l>
     <l n="3">Communing lonely with his sinking soul ,</l>
     <l n="4">And musing on the dubious glooms that lie</l>
     <l n="5">In dim obscurity before him ,— thee ,</l>
     <l n="6">Wrapt in thy dark magnificence , I call</l>
     <l n="7">At this still midnight hour , this awful season ,</l>
     <l n="8">When , on my bed , in wakeful restlessness ,</l>
     <l n="9">I turn me wearisome ; while all around ,</l>
     <l n="10">All , all , save me , sink in forgetfulness ;</l>
     <l n="11">I only wake to watch the sickly taper</l>
     <l n="12">Which lights me to my tomb . Yes , ‘ tis the hand</l>
     <l n="13">Of death I feel press heavy on my vitals ,</l>
     <l n="14">Slow sapping the warm current of existence .</l>
     <l n="15">My moments now are few — the sand of life</l>
     <l n="16">Ebbs fastly to its finish . Yet a little ,</l>
     <l n="17">And the last fleeting particle will fall</l>
     <l n="18">Silent , unseen , unnoticed , unlamented .</l>
     <l n="19">Come then , sad Thought , and let us meditate ,</l>
     <l n="20">While meditate we may .— We have now</l>
     <l n="21">— But a small portion of what men call time</l>
     <l n="22">To hold communion ; for even now the knife ,</l>
     <l n="23">The separating knife , I feel divide</l>
     <l n="24">The tender bond that binds my soul to earth .</l>
     <l n="25">Yes , I must die — I feel that I must die ;</l>
     <l n="26">And though to me has life been dark and dreary ,</l>
     <l n="27">Though Hope for me has smiled but to deceive ,</l>
     <l n="28">And Disappointment still pursued her blandishments ,</l>
     <l n="29">Yet do I feel my soul recoil within me</l>
     <l n="30">As I contemplate the dim gulf of death ,</l>
     <l n="31">The shuddering void , the awful blank — futurity .</l>
     <l n="32">Ay , I had planned full many a sanguine scheme</l>
     <l n="33">Of earthly happiness — romantic schemes ,</l>
     <l n="34">And fraught with loveliness ; and it is hard</l>
     <l n="35">To feel the hand of Death arrest one 's steps ,</l>

     <l n="1">Reader ! if with no vulgar sympathy</l>

     <l n="4">Here Cowper rests . Although renown have made</l>
     <l n="5">His name familiar to thine ear , this stone</l>

     <l n="9">With pity 's tones , and in the ear of woe</l>
     <l n="10">Spake music . Now , forgetful , at thy feet ,</l>
     <l n="11">His tired head presses on its last long rest ,</l>
     <l n="12">Still tenant of the tomb ;— and on the cheek ,</l>
     <l n="13">Once warm with animation 's lambent flush ,</l>
     <l n="14">Sits the pale image of unmark 'd decay .</l>
     <l n="15">Yet mourn not . He had chosen the better part ;</l>
     <l n="16">And , these sad garments of Mortality</l>
     <l n="17">Put off , we trust , that to a happier land</l>
     <l n="18">He went a light and gladsome passenger .</l>
     <l n="19">Sigh'st thou for honours , reader ? Call to mind</l>
     <l n="20">That glory 's voice is impotent to pierce</l>
     <l n="21">The silence of the tomb ! but virtue blooms</l>

    <head>WRITTEN AT A VERY EARLY AGE .</head>
     <l n="1">I 've read , my friend , of Dioclesian ,</l>
     <l n="2">And many another noble Grecian ,</l>
     <l n="3">Who wealth and palaces resigned ,</l>

     <l n="6">( Disgusting food to dainty chops )</l>
     <l n="7">I 've also read of , without wonder ;</l>
     <l n="8">But such a cursed egregious blunder ,</l>
     <l n="9">As that a man of wit and sense</l>
     <l n="10">Should leave his books to hoard up pence ,—</l>
     <l n="11">Forsake the loved Aonian maids</l>
     <l n="12">For all the petty tricks of trades ,</l>
     <l n="13">I never , either now , or long since ,</l>
     <l n="14">Have heard of such a peace of nonsense ;</l>
     <l n="15">That one who learning 's joys hath felt ,</l>
     <l n="16">And at the Muse 's altar knelt ,</l>
     <l n="17">Should leave a life of sacred leisure</l>
     <l n="18">To taste the accumulating pleasure ;</l>
     <l n="19">And , metamorphosed to an alley duck ,</l>
     <l n="20">Grovel in loads of kindred muck .</l>
     <l n="21">Oh ! ‘ t is beyond my comprehension !</l>
     <l n="22">A courtier throwing up his pension ,—</l>

     <l n="27">Had nature made thee half a fool ,</l>
     <l n="28">But given thee wit to keep a school ,</l>
     <l n="29">I had not stared at thy backsliding :</l>
     <l n="30">But when thy wit I can confide in ,</l>
     <l n="31">When well I know thy just pretence</l>
     <l n="32">To solid and exalted sense ;</l>
     <l n="33">When well I know that on thy head</l>
     <l n="34">Philosophy her lights hath shed ,</l>
     <l n="35">I stand aghast ! thy virtues sum to ,</l>
     <l n="36">I wonder what this world will come to !</l>
     <l n="37">Yet , whence this strain ? shall I repine</l>
     <l n="38">That thou alone dost singly shine ?</l>
     <l n="39">Shall I lament that thou alone ,</l>
     <l n="40">Of men of parts , hast prudence known ?</l>

     <l n="30">The busy bustling crowds could meditate ,</l>
     <l n="31">And send my thoughts ten thousand leagues away</l>
     <l n="32">Beyond the Atlantic , resting on my friend .</l>
     <l n="33">Ay , Contemplation , even in earliest youth</l>
     <l n="34">I woo 'd thy heavenly influence ! I would walk</l>
     <l n="35">A weary way when all my toils were done ,</l>
     <l n="36">To lay myself at night in some lone wood ,</l>
     <l n="37">And hear the sweet song of the nightingale .</l>
     <l n="38">Oh , those were times of happiness , and still</l>
     <l n="39">To memory doubly dear ; for growing years</l>
     <l n="40">Had not then taught me man was made to mourn ;</l>
     <l n="41">And a short hour of solitary pleasure ,</l>
     <l n="42">Stolen from sleep , was ample recompense</l>
     <l n="43">For all the hateful bustles of the day .</l>
     <l n="44">My opening mind was ductile then , and plastic ,</l>
     <l n="45">And soon the marks of care were worn away ,</l>
     <l n="46">While I was sway 'd by every novel impulse ,</l>
     <l n="47">Yielding to all the fancies of the hour .</l>
     <l n="48">But it has now assumed its character ;</l>
     <l n="49">Mark 'd by strong lineaments , its haughty tone ,</l>
     <l n="50">Like the firm oak , would sooner break than bend .</l>
     <l n="51">Yet still , O Contemplation ! I do love</l>
     <l n="52">To indulge thy solemn musings ; still the same</l>
     <l n="53">With thee alone I know to melt and weep ,</l>
     <l n="54">In thee alone delighting . Why along</l>
     <l n="55">The dusky tract of commerce should I toil ,</l>
     <l n="56">When , with an easy competence content ,</l>
     <l n="57">I can alone be happy ; where with thee</l>
     <l n="58">I may enjoy the loveliness of Nature ,</l>
     <l n="59">And loose the wings of Fancy ? Thus alone</l>
     <l n="60">Can I partake the happiness on earth ;</l>
     <l n="61">And to be happy here is a man 's chief end ,</l>
     <l n="62">For to be happy he must needs be good .</l>

     <l n="59">Of science unregretting ; eye afar</l>
     <l n="60">Philosophy upon her steepest height ,</l>

     <l n="2">When fancy wore the garb of truth ,</l>

     <l n="6">The midnight ghost was known to glide ;</l>
     <l n="7">Or lay me in some lonely glade ,</l>
     <l n="8">In native Sherwood 's forest shade ,</l>
     <l n="9">Where Robin Hood , the outlaw bold ,</l>
     <l n="10">Was wont his sylvan courts to hold ;</l>
     <l n="11">And there , as musing deep I lay ,</l>
     <l n="12">Would steal my little soul away ,</l>
     <l n="13">And all my pictures represent ,</l>
     <l n="14">Of siege and solemn tournament ;</l>
     <l n="15">Or bear me to the magic scene ,</l>
     <l n="16">Where , clad in greaves and gabardine ,</l>
     <l n="17">The warrior knight of chivalry</l>
     <l n="18">Made many a fierce enchanter flee ;</l>
     <l n="19">And bore the high-born dame away ,</l>
     <l n="20">Long held the fell magician 's prey .</l>
     <l n="21">Or oft would tell the shuddering tale</l>
     <l n="22">Of murders , and of goblins pale ,</l>
     <l n="23">Haunting the guilty baron 's side</l>
     <l n="24">( Whose floors with secret blood were dyed ) ,</l>
     <l n="25">Which o'er the vaulted corridor</l>
     <l n="26">On stormy nights was heard to roar ,</l>
     <l n="27">By old domestic , waken 'd wide</l>
     <l n="28">By the angry winds that chide :</l>

    <head>TO THE MEMORY OF HENRY KIRKE WHITE .</head>
    <head>BY A LADY .</head>
     <l n="1">If worth , if genius , to the world are dear ,</l>
     <l n="2">To Henry 's shade devote no common tear ;</l>
     <l n="3">His worth on no precarious tenure hung .</l>
     <l n="4">From genuine piety his virtues sprung ;</l>
     <l n="5">If pure benevolence , if steady sense ,</l>
     <l n="6">Can to the feeling heart delight dispense :</l>
     <l n="7">If all the highest efforts of the mind ,</l>
     <l n="8">Exalted , noble , elegant , refined ,</l>
     <l n="9">Call for fond sympathy 's heart-felt regret ,</l>
     <l n="10">Ye sons of genius , pay the mournful debt :</l>
     <l n="11">His friends can truly speak how large his claim ,</l>
     <l n="12">And “ Life was only wanting to his fame . ”</l>
     <l n="13">Art thou , indeed , dear youth , for ever fled ?</l>
     <l n="14">So quickly number 'd with the silent dead ?</l>
     <l n="15">Too sure I read it in the downcast eye ,</l>
     <l n="16">Hear it in mourning friendship 's stifled sigh .</l>
     <l n="17">Ah ! could esteem or admiration save</l>
     <l n="18">So dear an object from the untimely grave ,</l>
     <l n="19">This transcript faint had not essay 'd to tell</l>
     <l n="20">The loss of one beloved , revered so well ;</l>
     <l n="21">Vainly I try , even eloquence were weak ,</l>
     <l n="22">The silent sorrow that I feel to speak .</l>
     <l n="23">No more my hours of pain thy voice will cheer ,</l>
     <l n="24">And bind my spirit to this lower sphere ;</l>
     <l n="25">Bend o'er my suffering frame with gentle sigh ,</l>
     <l n="26">And bid new fire relume my languid eye :</l>
     <l n="27">No more the pencil 's mimic art command ,</l>
     <l n="28">And with kind pity guide my trembling hand ;</l>
     <l n="29">Nor dwell upon the page in fond regard ,</l>
     <l n="30">To trace the meaning of the Tuscan bard .</l>
     <l n="31">Vain all the pleasures thou canst not inspire ,</l>
     <l n="32">And “ in my breast the imperfect joys expire . ”</l>
     <l n="33">I fondly hoped thy hand might grace my shrine ,</l>
     <l n="34">And little dream 'd I should have wept o'er thine :</l>
     <l n="35">In fancy 's eye methought I saw thy lyre</l>
     <l n="36">With virtue 's energies each bosom fire ;</l>
     <l n="37">I saw admiring nations press around ,</l>
     <l n="38">Eager to catch the animating sound :</l>
     <l n="39">And when , at length , sunk in the shades of night ,</l>
     <l n="40">To brighter worlds thy spirit wing 'd its flight ,</l>
     <l n="41">Thy country hail 'd thy venerated shade ,</l>
     <l n="42">And each graced honour to thy memory paid .</l>
     <l n="43">Such was the fate hope pictured to my view —</l>
     <l n="44">But who , alas ! e'er found hope 's visions true ?</l>
     <l n="45">And , ah ! a dark presage , when last we met ,</l>
     <l n="46">Sadden 'd the social hour with deep regret ;</l>
     <l n="47">When thou thy portrait from the minstrel drew ,</l>
     <l n="48">The living Edwin starting on my view —</l>
     <l n="49">Silent , I ask 'd of Heaven a lengthen 'd date ;</l>
     <l n="50">His genius thine , but not like thine his fate .</l>
     <l n="51">Shuddering I gazed , and saw too sure revealed ,</l>
     <l n="52">The fatal truth , by hope till then conceal 'd .</l>
     <l n="53">Too strong the portion of celestial flame</l>
     <l n="54">For its weak tenement the fragile frame ;</l>
     <l n="55">Too soon for us it sought its native sky ,</l>
     <l n="56">And soar 'd impervious to the mortal eye ,</l>
     <l n="57">Like some clear planet , shadow 'd from our sight ,</l>
     <l n="58">Leaving behind long tracks of lucid light :</l>
     <l n="59">So shall thy bright example fire each youth</l>
     <l n="60">With love of virtue , piety , and truth .</l>
     <l n="61">Long o'er thy loss shall grateful Granta mourn ,</l>
     <l n="62">And bid her sons revere thy favour 'd urn .</l>
     <l n="63">When thy loved flower “ spring 's victory makes known , ”</l>
     <l n="64">The primrose pale shall bloom for thee alone :</l>
     <l n="65">Around thy urn the rosemary well spread ,</l>
     <l n="66">Whose “ tender fragrance , ” — emblem of the dead —</l>
     <l n="67">Shall “ teach the maid , whose bloom no longer lives , ”</l>
     <l n="68">That “ virtue every perish 'd grace survives . ”</l>
     <l n="69">Farewell ! sweet Moralist ; heart-sickening grief</l>
     <l n="70">Tells me in duty 's path to seek relief ,</l>
     <l n="71">With surer aim on faith 's strong pinions rise ,</l>
     <l n="72">And seek hope 's vanish 'd anchor in the skies .</l>
     <l n="73">Yet still on thee shall fond remembrance dwell ,</l>
     <l n="74">And to the world thy worth delight to tell ;</l>
     <l n="75">Though well I feel unworthy thee the lays</l>
     <l n="76">That to thy memory weeping friendship pays .</l>

     <l n="1">Ye gentlest gales ! oh , hither waft ,</l>
     <l n="2">On airy undulating sweeps ,</l>
     <l n="3">Your frequent sighs so passing soft ,</l>
     <l n="4">Where he , the youthful Poet , sleeps !</l>
     <l n="5">He breathed the purest tenderest sigh ,</l>
     <l n="6">The sigh of sensibility .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">And thou shalt lie , his favourite flower ,</l>
     <l n="8">Pale primrose , on his grave reclined ;</l>
     <l n="9">Sweet emblem of his fleeting hour ,</l>
     <l n="10">And of his pure , his spotless mind !</l>
     <l n="11">Like thee he sprung in lowly vale ;</l>
     <l n="12">And felt , like thee , the trying gale .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">Nor hence thy pensive eye seclude ,</l>

     <l n="15">Where he , “ in marble solitude ,</l>
     <l n="16">So peaceful and so deep ” doth lie !</l>
     <l n="17">His harp prophetic sung to thee</l>

     <l n="19">Ye falling dews , Oh ! ever leave</l>

     <l n="21">At earliest morn , at latest eve ,</l>
     <l n="22">Oh let them for their poet weep !</l>
     <l n="23">For tears bedew 'd his gentle eye ,</l>
     <l n="24">The tears of heavenly sympathy .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">Thou western Sun , effuse thy beams ;</l>
     <l n="26">for he was wont to pace the glade ,</l>
     <l n="27">To watch in pale uncertain gleams ,</l>
     <l n="28">The crimson-zoned horizon fade —</l>
     <l n="29">Thy last , they setting radiance pour ,</l>
     <l n="30">Where he is set to rise no more .</l>
