       <l n="1">Orleans was hush 'd in sleep . Stretch 'd on her couch</l>
       <l n="2">The delegated Maiden lay : with toil</l>
       <l n="3">Exhausted and sore anguish , soon she closed</l>
       <l n="4">Her heavy eye-lids ; not reposing then ,</l>
       <l n="5">For busy Phantasy , in other scenes</l>
       <l n="6">Awakened . Whether that superior powers ,</l>
       <l n="7">By wise permission , prompt the midnight dream ,</l>
       <l n="8">Instructing so the passive<span corresp="#note1" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>faculty ;</l>
       <l n="9">Or that the soul , escaped its fleshly clog ,</l>
       <l n="10">Flies free , and soars amid the invisible world ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="12">Along a moor ,</l>
       <l n="13">Barren , and wide , and drear , and desolate ,</l>
       <l n="14">She roam 'd a wanderer thro ’ the cheerless night .</l>
       <l n="15">Far thro ’ the silence of the unbroken plain</l>
       <l n="16">The bittern 's boom was heard , hoarse , heavy , deep ,</l>
       <l n="17">It made most fitting music to the scene .</l>
       <l n="18">Black clouds , driven fast before the stormy wind ,</l>
       <l n="19">Swept shadowing ; thro ’ their broken folds the moon</l>
       <l n="20">Struggled sometimes with transitory ray ,</l>
       <l n="21">And made the moving darkness visible .</l>
       <l n="22">And now arrived beside a fenny lake</l>
       <l n="23">She stands : amid its stagnate waters , hoarse</l>
       <l n="24">The long sedge rustled to the gales of night .</l>
       <l n="25">An age-worn bark receives the Maid , impell 'd</l>
       <l n="26">By powers unseen ; then did the moon display</l>
       <l n="27">Where thro ’ the crazy vessel 's yawning side</l>
       <l n="28">The muddy wave oozed in : a female guides ,</l>
       <l n="29">And spreads the sail before the wind , that moan 'd</l>
       <l n="30">As melancholy mournful to her ear ,</l>
       <l n="31">As ever by the dungeon 'd wretch was heard</l>
       <l n="32">Howling at evening round the embattled towers</l>
       <l n="33">Of that hell-house<span corresp="#note3" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>of France , ere yet sublime</l>
       <l n="34">The almighty people from their tyrant 's hand</l>
       <l n="35">Dash 'd down the iron rod .</l>
       <l n="36">Intent the Maid</l>
       <l n="37">Gazed on the pilot 's form , and as she gazed</l>
       <l n="38">Shiver 'd , for wan her face was , and her eyes</l>
       <l n="39">Hollow , and her sunk cheeks were furrowed deep ,</l>
       <l n="40">Channell 'd by tears ; a few grey locks hung down</l>
       <l n="41">Beneath her hood : then thro ’ the Maiden 's veins</l>
       <l n="42">Chill crept the blood , for , as the night-breeze pass 'd ,</l>
       <l n="43">Lifting her tattcr 'd mantle , coil 'd around</l>
       <l n="44">She saw a serpent gnawing at her heart .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="45">The plumeless bat with short shrill note flits by ,</l>
       <l n="46">And the night-raven 's scream came fitfully ,</l>
       <l n="47">Borne on the hollow blast . Eager the Maid</l>
       <l n="48">Look 'd to the shore , and now upon the bank</l>
       <l n="49">Leaps , joyful to escape , yet trembling still</l>
       <l n="50">In recollection .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="51">There , a mouldering pile</l>
       <l n="52">Stretch 'd its wide ruins , o'er the plain below</l>
       <l n="53">Casting a gloomy shade , save where the moon</l>
       <l n="54">Shone thro ’ its fretted windows : the dark Yew ,</l>
       <l n="55">Withering with age , branched there its naked roots ,</l>
       <l n="56">And there the melancholy Cypress rear 'd</l>
       <l n="57">Its head ; the earth was heav 'd with many a mound ,</l>
       <l n="58">And here and there a half-demolish 'd tomb .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="59">And now , amid the ruin 's darkest shade ,</l>
       <l n="60">The Virgin 's eye beheld where pale blue flames</l>
       <l n="61">Rose wavering , now just gleaming from the earth ,</l>
       <l n="62">And now in darkness drown 'd . An aged man</l>
       <l n="63">Sat near , seated on what in long-past days</l>
       <l n="64">Had been some sculptur 'd monument , now fallen</l>
       <l n="65">And half-obscured by moss , and gathered heaps</l>
       <l n="66">Of withered yew-leaves and earth-mouldering bones ;</l>
       <l n="67">And shining in the ray was seen the track</l>
       <l n="68">Of slimy snail obscene . Composed his look ,</l>
       <l n="69">His eye was large and rayless , and fix 'd full</l>
       <l n="70">Upon the Maid ; the blue flames on his face</l>
       <l n="71">Stream 'd a pale light ; his face was of the hue</l>
       <l n="72">Of death ; his limbs were mantled in a shroud .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="73">Then with a deep heart-terrifying voice ,</l>
       <l n="74">Exclaim 'd the Spectre , “ Welcome to these realms ,</l>
       <l n="75">These regions of DESPAIR ! O thou whose steps</l>
       <l n="76">By GRIEF conducted to these sad abodes</l>
       <l n="77">Have pierced ; welcome , welcome to this gloom</l>
       <l n="78">Eternal , to this everlasting night ,</l>
       <l n="79">Where never morning darts the enlivening ray ,</l>
       <l n="80">Where never shines the sun , but all is dark ,</l>
       <l n="81">Dark as the bosom of their gloomy King . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="82">So saying he arose , and by the hand</l>
       <l n="83">The Virgin seized with such a death-cold touch</l>
       <l n="84">As froze her very heart ; and drawing on ,</l>
       <l n="85">Her , to the abbey 's inner ruin , led</l>
       <l n="86">Resistless . Thro ’ the broken roof the moon</l>
       <l n="87">Glimmer 'd a scatter 'd ray ; the ivy twined</l>
       <l n="88">Round the dismantled column ; imaged forms</l>
       <l n="89">Of Saints and warlike Chiefs , moss-canker 'd now</l>
       <l n="90">And mutilate , lay strewn upon the ground ,</l>
       <l n="91">With crumbled fragments , crucifixes fallen ,</l>
       <l n="92">And rusted trophies ; and amid the heap</l>
       <l n="93">Some monument 's defaced legend spake</l>
       <l n="94">All human glory vain .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="95">The loud blast roar 'd</l>
       <l n="96">Amid the pile ; and from the tower the owl</l>
       <l n="97">Scream 'd as the tempest shook her secret nest .</l>
       <l n="98">He , silent , led her on , and often paus 'd ,</l>
       <l n="99">And pointed , that her eye might contemplate</l>
       <l n="100">At leisure the drear scene .</l>
       <l n="101">He dragged her on</l>
       <l n="102">Thro ’ a low iron door , down broken stairs ;</l>
       <l n="103">Then a cold horror thro ’ the Maiden 's frame</l>
       <l n="104">Crept , for she stood amid a vault , and saw ,</l>
       <l n="105">By the sepulchral lamp 's dim glaring light ,</l>
       <l n="106">The fragments of the dead .</l>
       <l n="107">“ Look here ! ” he cried ,</l>
       <l n="108">“ Damsel , look here ! survey this house of Death ;</l>
       <l n="109">O soon to tenant it ! soon to increase</l>
       <l n="110">These trophies of mortality ! for hence</l>
       <l n="111">Is no return . Gaze here ! behold this skull ,</l>
       <l n="112">These eyeless sockets , and these unflesh 'd jaws ,</l>
       <l n="113">That with their ghastly grinning , seem to mock</l>
       <l n="114">Thy perishable charms ; for thus thy cheek</l>
       <l n="115">Must moulder . Child of Grief ! shrinks not thy soul ,</l>
       <l n="116">Viewing these horrors ? trembles not thy heart</l>
       <l n="117">At the dread thought , that here its life'shYpppHeNblood soon</l>
       <l n="118">Now warm in life and feeling , mingle soon</l>
       <l n="119">With the cold clod ? a thought most horrible !</l>
       <l n="120">So only dreadful , for reality</l>
       <l n="121">Is none of suffering here ; here all is peace ;</l>
       <l n="122">No nerve will throb to anguish in the grave .</l>
       <l n="123">Dreadful it is to think of losing life ;</l>
       <l n="124">But having lost , knowledge of loss is not ,</l>
       <l n="125">Therefore no ill. Haste , Maiden , to repose ;</l>
       <l n="126">Probe deep the seat of life . ”</l>
       <l n="127">So spake DESPAIR</l>
       <l n="128">The vaulted roof echoed his hollow voice ,</l>
       <l n="129">And all again was silence . Quick her heart</l>
       <l n="130">Panted . He drew a dagger from his breast ,</l>
       <l n="131">And cried again , “ Haste Damsel to repose !</l>
       <l n="132">One blow , and rest for ever ! ” On the Fiend</l>
       <l n="133">Dark scowl 'd the Virgin with indignant eye ,</l>
       <l n="134">And dash 'd the dagger down . He next his heart</l>
       <l n="135">Replaced the murderous steel , and drew the Maid</l>
       <l n="136">Along the downward vault .</l>
       <l n="137">The damp earth gave</l>
       <l n="138">A dim sound as they pass 'd : the tainted air</l>
       <l n="139">Was cold , and heavy with unwholesome dews .</l>
       <l n="140">“ Behold ! ” the fiend exclaim 'd , “ how gradual here</l>
       <l n="141">The fleshly burden of mortality</l>
       <l n="142">Moulders to clay ! ” then fixing his broad eye</l>
       <l n="143">Full on her face , he pointed where a corpse</l>
       <l n="144">Lay livid ; she beheld with loathing look ,</l>
       <l n="145">The spectacle abhorr 'd by living man .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="146">“ Look here ! ” DESPAIR pursued , “ this loathsome mass</l>
       <l n="147">Was once as lovely , and as full of life</l>
       <l n="148">As , Damsel ! thou art now . Those deep-sunk eyes</l>
       <l n="149">Once beam 'd the mild light of intelligence ,</l>
       <l n="150">And where thou seest the pamper 'd flesh-worm trail ,</l>
       <l n="151">Once the white bosom heaved . She fondly thought</l>
       <l n="152">That at the hallowed altar , soon the Priest</l>
       <l n="153">Should bless her coming union , and the torch</l>
       <l n="154">Its joyful lustre o'er the hall of joy ,</l>
       <l n="155">Cast on her nuptial evening : earth to earth</l>
       <l n="156">That Priest consign 'd her , and the funeral lamp</l>
       <l n="157">Glares on her cold face ; for her lover went</l>
       <l n="158">By glory lur 'd to war , and perish 'd there ;</l>
       <l n="159">Nor she endur 'd to live . Ha ! fades thy cheek ?</l>
       <l n="160">Dost thou then , Maiden , tremble at the tale ?</l>
       <l n="161">Look here ! behold the youthful paramour !</l>
       <l n="162">The self-devoted hero ! ”</l>
       <l n="163">Fearfully</l>
       <l n="164">The Maid look 'd down , and saw the well known face</l>
       <l n="165">Of THEODORE ! in thoughts unspeakable ,</l>
       <l n="166">Convulsed with horror , o'er her face she clasp 'd</l>
       <l n="167">Her cold damp hands : “ Shrink not , ” the Phantom cried ,</l>
       <l n="168">“ Gaze on ! for ever gaze ! ” more firm he grasp 'd</l>
       <l n="169">Her quivering arm : “ this lifeless mouldering clay ,</l>
       <l n="170">As well thou know'st , was warm with all the glow</l>
       <l n="171">Of Youth and Love ; this is the arm that cleaved</l>
       <l n="172">Salisbury 's proud crest , now motionless in death ,</l>
       <l n="173">Unable to protect the ravaged frame</l>
       <l n="174">From the foul Offspring of Mortality</l>
       <l n="175">That feed on heroes . Tho ’ long years were thine ,</l>
       <l n="176">Yet never more would life reanimate</l>
       <l n="177">This murdered man ; murdered by thee ! for thou</l>
       <l n="178">Didst lead him to the battle from his home ,</l>
       <l n="179">Else living there in peace to good old age :</l>
       <l n="180">In thy defence he died : strike deep ! destroy</l>
       <l n="181">Remorse with Life . ”</l>
       <l n="182">The Maid stood motionless ,</l>
       <l n="183">And , wistless what she did , with trembling hand</l>
       <l n="184">Received the dagger . Starting then , she cried ,</l>
       <l n="185">“ Avaunt DESPAIR ! Eternal Wisdom deals</l>
       <l n="186">Or peace to man , or misery , for his good</l>
       <l n="187">Alike design 'd ; and shall the Creature cry ,</l>
       <l n="188">Why hast thou done this ? and with impious pride</l>
       <l n="189">Destroy the life God gave ? ”</l>
       <l n="190">The Fiend rejoin 'd ,</l>
       <l n="191">“ And thou dost deem it impious to destroy</l>
       <l n="192">The life God gave ? What , Maiden , is the lot</l>
       <l n="193">Assigned to mortal man ? born but to drag ,</l>
       <l n="194">Thro ’ life 's long pilgrimage , the wearying load</l>
       <l n="195">Of being ; care corroded at the heart ;</l>
       <l n="196">Assail 'd by all the numerous train of ills</l>
       <l n="197">That flesh inherits ; till at length worn out ,</l>
       <l n="198">This is his consummation !— think again !</l>
       <l n="199">What , Maiden , canst thou hope from lengthen 'd life</l>
       <l n="200">But lengthen 'd sorrow ? If protracted long ,</l>
       <l n="201">Till on the bed of death thy feeble limbs</l>
       <l n="202">Outstretch their languid length , oh think what thoughts ,</l>
       <l n="203">What agonizing woes , in that dread hour ,</l>
       <l n="204">Assail the sinking heart ! slow beats the pulse ,</l>
       <l n="205">Dim grows the eye , and clammy drops bedew</l>
       <l n="206">The shuddering frame ; then in its mightiest force ,</l>
       <l n="207">Mightiest in impotence , the love of life</l>
       <l n="208">Seizes the throbbing heart , the faltering lips</l>
       <l n="209">Pour out the impious prayer , that fain would change</l>
       <l n="210">The unchangeable 's decree , surrounding friends</l>
       <l n="211">Sob round the sufferer , wet his cheek with tears ,</l>
       <l n="212">And all he loved in life embitters death !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="213">Such , Maiden , are the pangs that wait the hour</l>
       <l n="214">Of calmest dissolution ! yet weak man</l>

     <note xml:id="note2" place="bottom" n="2">I have met with a singular tale to illustrate this spiritual theory of dreams .</note>
     <p>Guntram , King of the Franks , was liberal to the poor , and he himself experienced the wonderful effects of divine liberality . For one day as he was hunting in a forest he was separated from his companions and arrived at a little stream of water with only one comrade of tried and approved fidelity . Here he found himself opprest by drowsiness , and reclining his head upon the servant 's lap went to sleep . The servant witnessed a wonderful thing , for he saw a little beast ( ‘ bestiolam ’ ) creep out of the mouth of his sleeping master , and go immediately to the streamlet , which it vainly attempted to cross . The servant drew his sword and laid it across the water , over which the little beast easily past and crept into a hole of a mountain on the opposite side ; from whence it made its appearance again in an hour , and returned by the same means into the King 's mouth . The King then awakened , and told his companion that he had dreamt that he was arrived upon the bank of an immense river , which he had crossed by a bridge of iron , and from thence came to a mountain in which a great quantity of gold was concealed . When the King had concluded , the servant related what he had beheld , and they both went to examine the mountain , where upon digging they discovered an immense weight of gold .</p>

       <l n="1">I stumbled upon this tale in a book entitled SPHINX</l>

     </lg>
     <p>For the truth of this theory there is the evidence of a Monkish miracle . When Thurcillus was about to follow St. Julian and visit the world of souls , his guide said to him , “ let thy body rest in the bed for thy spirit only is about to depart with me ; and lest the body should appear dead , I will send into it a vital breath . ”</p>
     <p>The body however by a strange sympathy was affected like the spirit ; for when the foul and fetid smoke that arose from tithes witheld , had nearly suffocated Thurcillus , and made him cough twice , those who were near his body said that it coughed twice about the same time .</p>

       <l n="30">Perforce , and painful . ”</l>
       <l n="31">Thus the Spirit spake ,</l>
       <l n="32">And led the Maid along a narrow path ,</l>
       <l n="33">Dark gleaming to the light of far-off flames ,</l>
       <l n="34">More dread than darkness . Soon the distant sound</l>
       <l n="35">Of clanking anvils , and the lengthened breath</l>
       <l n="36">Provoking fire are heard : and now they reach</l>
       <l n="37">A wide expanded den where all around</l>
       <l n="38">Tremendous furnaces , with hellish blaze ,</l>
       <l n="39">Flamed dreadful . At the heaving bellows stood</l>
       <l n="40">The meagre form of Care , and as he blew</l>
       <l n="41">To augment the fire , the fire augmented scorch 'd</l>
       <l n="42">His wretched limbs : sleepless for ever thus</l>
       <l n="43">He toil 'd and toil 'd , of toil to reap no end</l>
       <l n="44">But endless toil and never-ending woe .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="45">An aged man went round the infernal vault ,</l>
       <l n="46">Urging his workmen to their ceaseless task :</l>
       <l n="47">White were his locks , as is the wintry snow</l>
       <l n="48">On hoar Plinlimmon 's head . A golden staff</l>
       <l n="49">His steps supported ; powerful talisman ,</l>

       <l n="83">And from the roof a diamond light emits ;</l>
       <l n="84">Rubies and amethysts their glows commix 'd</l>

       <l n="88">There on golden seats ,</l>
       <l n="89">A numerous , sullen , melancholy train</l>

       <l n="162">Of Princes , and state-wearied Ministers ,</l>
       <l n="163">Maddening he reigns ; and when the affrighted mind</l>

       <l n="180">Their delegates , wise , independent men ,</l>
       <l n="181">Unbribing and unbrib 'd , and cull 'd to guard</l>
       <l n="182">Their rights and charters from the encroaching grasp</l>
       <l n="183">Of greedy Power : then all the joyful land</l>

       <l n="185">To make the important choice .</l>
       <l n="186">The observing Maid</l>

     <p>They enter 'd there a large and lofty dome , O'er whose black marble sides a dim drear light Struggled with darkness from the unfrequent lamp . Enthroned around , the MURDERERS OF MANKIND , Monarchs , the great ! the glorious ! the august ! Each bearing on his brow a crown of fire , Sat stern and silent . Nimrod he was there , First King the mighty hunter ; and that Chief Who did belie his mother 's fame , that so He might be called young Ammon . In this court Cæsar was crown 'd , accurst liberticide ; And he who murdered Tully , that cold villain , Octavius , tho ’ the courtly minion 's lyre Hath hymn 'd his praise , tho ’ Maro sung to him , And when Death levelled to original clay The royal carcase , FLATTERY , fawning low , Fell at his feet , and worshipped the new God . Titus<span corresp="#note3_2" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>was here , the Conqueror of the Jews , He the Delight of human-kind misnamed ; Cæsars and Soldans , Emperors and Kings , Here they were all , all who for glory fought , Here in the COURT OF GLORY , reaping now The meed they merited . As gazing round The Virgin mark 'd the miserable train , A deep and hollow voice from one went forth ; “ Thou who art come to view our punishment , Maiden of Orleans ! hither turn thine eyes , For I am he whose bloody victories Thy power hath rendered vain . Lo ! I am here , The hero conqueror of Azincour , HENRY OF ENGLAND !— wretched that I am , I might have reigned in happiness and peace , My coffers full , my subjects undisturb 'd , And PLENTY and PROSPERITY had loved To dwell amongst them : but mine eye beheld The realm of France , by faction tempest-torn , And therefore I did think that it would fall An easy prey . I persecuted those Who taught new doctrines , tho ’ they taught the truth : And when I heard of thousands by the sword Cut off , or blasted by the pestilence , I calmly counted up my proper gains , And sent new herds to slaughter . Temperate Myself , no blood that mutinied , no vice Tainting my private life , I sent abroad MURDER and RAPE ; and therefore am I doom 'd , Like these imperial Sufferers , crown 'd with fire , Here to remain , till Man 's awaken 'd eye Shall see the genuine blackness of our deeds , And warn 'd by them , till the whole human race , Equalling in bliss the aggregate we caus 'd Of wretchedness , shall form ONE BROTHERHOOD , ONE UNIVERSAL FAMILY OF LOVE . ”</p>
     <note xml:id="note1_2" place="bottom" n="1">In the former edition I had substituted ‘ cable ’ instead of ‘ camel ’ . The alteration would not be worth noticing were it not for the circumstance which occasioned it . ‘ Facilius elephas per foramen acus ’ , is among the Hebrew adages collected by Drusius ; the same metaphor is found in two other Jewish proverbs , and this appears to determine the signification of [ Greek ( transliterated ): chamaelos ] .

     <note xml:id="note3_2" place="bottom" n="3">During the siege of Jerusalem , “ the Roman commander , ‘ with a generous clemency , that inseparable attendant on true heroism , ‘ laboured incessantly , and to the very last moment , to preserve the place . With this view , he again and again intreated the tyrants to surrender and save their lives . With the same view also , after carrying the second wall the siege was intermitted four days : to rouse their fears , ‘ prisoners , to the number of five hundred , or more were crucified daily before the walls ; till space ’ , Josephus says , ‘ was wanting for the crosses , and crosses for the captives ’ . ”</note>

       <l n="3">A cavern , at whose mouth a Genius stood ,</l>
       <l n="4">In front a beardless youth , whose smiling eye</l>
       <l n="5">Beam 'd promise , but behind , withered and old ,</l>

       <l n="8">Now rent and faded : in his hand he held</l>
       <l n="9">An hour-glass , and as fall the restless sands ,</l>
       <l n="10">So pass the lives of men . By him they past</l>

       <l n="12">Still rolling onward its perpetual waves ,</l>
       <l n="13">Noiseless and undisturbed . Here they ascend</l>
       <l n="14">A Bark unpiloted , that down the flood ,</l>
       <l n="15">Borne by the current , rush 'd . The circling stream ,</l>

       <l n="27">Her mouth half-open 'd , and her head stretch 'd forth .</l>

       <l n="111">No more she saw the long-drawn lines of grief ,</l>

       <l n="113">The languid eye : youth 's loveliest freshness now</l>
       <l n="114">Mantled her cheek , whose every lineament</l>
       <l n="115">Bespake the soul at rest , a holy calm ,</l>

       <l n="2">Margaret ! my Cousin !— nay , you must not smile ;</l>
       <l n="3">I love the homely and familiar phrase ;</l>
       <l n="4">And I will call thee Cousin Margaret ,</l>
       <l n="5">However quaint amid the measured line</l>
       <l n="6">The good old term appears . Oh ! it looks ill</l>
       <l n="7">When delicate tongues disclaim old terms of kin ,</l>
       <l n="8">Sirring and Madaming as civilly</l>
       <l n="9">As if the road between the heart and lips</l>
       <l n="10">Were such a weary and Laplandish way</l>
       <l n="11">That the poor travellers came to the red gates</l>
       <l n="12">Half frozen . Trust me Cousin Margaret ,</l>
       <l n="13">For many a day my Memory has played</l>
       <l n="14">The creditor with me on your account ,</l>
       <l n="15">And made me shame to think that I should owe</l>
       <l n="16">So long the debt of kindness . But in truth ,</l>
       <l n="17">Like Christian on his pilgrimage , I bear</l>
       <l n="18">So heavy a pack of business , that albeit</l>
       <l n="19">I toil on mainly , in our twelve hours race</l>
       <l n="20">Time leaves me distanced . Loath indeed were I</l>
       <l n="21">That for a moment you should lay to me</l>
       <l n="22">Unkind neglect ; mine , Margaret , is a heart</l>
       <l n="23">That smokes not , yet methinks there should be some</l>
       <l n="24">Who know how warm it beats . I am not one</l>
       <l n="25">Who can play off my smiles and courtesies</l>
       <l n="26">To every Lady of her lap dog tired</l>
       <l n="27">Who wants a play-thing ; I am no sworn friend</l>
       <l n="28">Of half-an-hour , as apt to leave as love ;</l>
       <l n="29">Mine are no mushroom feelings that spring up</l>
       <l n="30">At once without a seed and take no root ,</l>
       <l n="31">Wiseliest distrusted . In a narrow sphere</l>
       <l n="32">The little circle of domestic life</l>
       <l n="33">I would be known and loved ; the world beyond</l>
       <l n="34">Is not for me . But Margaret , sure I think</l>
       <l n="35">That you should know me well , for you and I</l>
       <l n="36">Grew up together , and when we look back</l>
       <l n="37">Upon old times our recollections paint</l>
       <l n="38">The same familiar faces . Did I wield</l>
       <l n="39">The wand of Merlin 's magic I would make</l>
       <l n="40">Brave witchcraft . We would have a faery ship ,</l>
       <l n="41">Aye , a new Ark , as in that other flood</l>
       <l n="42">That cleansed the sons of Anak from the earth ,</l>
       <l n="43">The Sylphs should waft us to some goodly isle</l>
       <l n="44">Like that where whilome old Apollidon</l>
       <l n="45">Built up his blameless spell ; and I would bid</l>
       <l n="46">The Sea Nymphs pile around their coral bowers ,</l>
       <l n="47">That we might stand upon the beach , and mark</l>
       <l n="48">The far-off breakers shower their silver spray ,</l>
       <l n="49">And hear the eternal roar whose pleasant sound</l>
       <l n="50">Told us that never mariner should reach</l>
       <l n="51">Our quiet coast . In such a blessed isle</l>
       <l n="52">We might renew the days of infancy ,</l>
       <l n="53">And Life like a long childhood pass away ,</l>
       <l n="54">Without one care . It may be , Margaret ,</l>
       <l n="55">That I shall yet be gathered to my friends ,</l>
       <l n="56">For I am not of those who live estranged</l>
       <l n="57">Of choice , till at the last they join their race</l>
       <l n="58">In the family vault . If so , if I should lose ,</l>
       <l n="59">Like my old friend the Pilgrim , this huge pack</l>
       <l n="60">So heavy on my shoulders , I and mine</l>
       <l n="61">Will end our pilgrimage most pleasantly .</l>
       <l n="62">If not , if I should never get beyond</l>
       <l n="63">This Vanity town , there is another world</l>
       <l n="64">Where friends will meet . And often , Margaret ,</l>
       <l n="65">I gaze at night into the boundless sky ,</l>
       <l n="66">And think that I shall there be born again ,</l>
       <l n="67">The exalted native of some better star ;</l>
       <l n="68">And like the rude American I hope</l>
       <l n="69">To find in Heaven the things I loved on earth .</l>

     <p>A. D. 852 . Circa dies istos , mulier quædam malefica , in villâ quæ Berkeleia dicitur degens , gulæ amatrix ac petulantiæ , flagitiis modum usque in senium et auguriis non ponens , usque ad mortem impudica permansit . Hæc die quadam cum sederet ad prandium , cornicula quam pro delitiis pascebat , nescio quid garrire coepit ; quo audito , mulieris cultellus de manu excidit , simul et facies pallescere coepit , et emisso rugitu , hodie , inquit , accipiam grande incommodum , hodieque ad sulcum ultimum meum pervenit aratrum , quo dicto , nuncius doloris intravit ; muliere vero percunctata ad quid veniret , affero , inquit , tibi filii tui obitum &amp; totius familiæ ejus ex subita ruina interitum . Hoc quoque dolore mulier permota , lecto protinus decubuit graviter infirmata ; sentiensque morbum subrepere ad vitalia , liberos quos habuit superstites , monachum videlicet et monacham , per epistolam invitavit ; advenientes autem voce singultiente alloquitur . Ego , inquit , o pueri , meo miserabili fato dæmoniacis semper artibus inservivi ; ego omnium vitiorum sentina , ego illecebrarum omnium fui magistra . Erat tamen mihi inter hæc mala , spes vestræ religionis , quæ meam solidaret animam desperatam ; vos expctabam propugnatores contra dæmones , tutores contra sævissimos hostes . Nunc igitur quoniam ad finem vitæ perveni , rogo vos per materna ubera , ut mea tentatis alleviare tormenta . Insuite me defunctam in corio cervino , ac deinde in sarcophago lapideo supponite , operculumque ferro et plumbo constringite , ac demum lapidem tribus cathenis ferreis et fortissimis circundantes , clericos quinquaginta psalmorum cantores , et tot per tres dies presbyteros missarum celebratores applicate , qui feroces lenigent adversariorum incursus . Ita si tribus noctibus secura jacuero , quarta die me infodite humo .</p>
     <p>Factumque est ut præceperat illis . Sed , proh dolor ! nil preces , nil lacrymæ , nil demum valuere catenæ . Primis enim duabus noctibus , cum chori psallentium corpori assistabant , advenientes Dæmones ostium ecclesiæ confregerunt ingenti obice clausum , extremasque cathenas negotio levi dirumpunt : media autem quæ fortior erat , illibata manebat . Tertia autem nocte , circa gallicinium , strepitu hostium adventantium , omne monasterium visum est a fundamento moveri . Unus ergo dæmonum , et vultu cæteris terribilior &amp; statura eminentior , januas Ecclesiæ ; impetu violento concussas in fragmenta dejecit . Divexerunt clerici cum laicis , metu stelerunt omnium capilli , et psalmorum concentus defecit . Dæmon ergo gestu ut videbatur arroganti ad sepulchrum accedens , &amp; nomen mulieris modicum ingeminans , surgere imperavit . Qua respondente , quod nequiret pro vinculis , jam malo tuo , inquit , solveris ; et protinus cathenam quæ cæterorum ferociam dæmonum deluserat , velut stuppeum vinculum rumpebat . Operculum etiam sepulchri pede depellens , mulierem palam omnibus ab ecclesia extraxit , ubi præ foribus niger equus superbe hinniens videbatur , uncis ferreis et clavis undique confixus , super quem misera mulier projecta , ab oculis assistentium evanuit . Audiebantur tamen clamores per quatuor fere miliaria horribiles , auxilium postulantes .</p>
     <p>Ista itaque quæ retuli incredibilia non erunt , si legatur beati Gregorii dialogus , in quo refert , hominem in ecclesia sepultam , a dæmonibus foras ejectum . Et apud Francos Carolus Martellus insignis vir fortudinis , qui Saracenos Galliam ingressos , Hispaniam redire compulit , exactis vitæ suæ diebus , in Ecclesia beati Dionysii legitur fuisse sepultus . Sed quia patrimonia , cum decimis omnium fere ecclesiarum Galliæ , pro stipendio commilitonum suorum mutilaverat , miserabiliter a malignis spiritibus de sepulchro corporaliter avulsus , usque in hodiernum diem nusquam comparuit .</p>

      <head>HENRY THE HERMIT .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">It was a little island where he dwelt ,</l>
       <l n="2">Or rather a lone rock , barren and bleak ,</l>
       <l n="3">Short scanty herbage spotting with dark spots</l>
       <l n="4">Its gray stone surface . Never mariner</l>
       <l n="5">Approach 'd that rude and uninviting coast ,</l>
       <l n="6">Nor ever fisherman his lonely bark</l>
       <l n="7">Anchored beside its shore . It was a place</l>
       <l n="8">Befitting well a rigid anchoret ,</l>
       <l n="9">Dead to the hopes , and vanities , and joys</l>
       <l n="10">And purposes of life ; and he had dwelt</l>
       <l n="11">Many long years upon that lonely isle ,</l>
       <l n="12">For in ripe manhood he abandoned arms ,</l>
       <l n="13">Honours and friends and country and the world ,</l>
       <l n="14">And had grown old in solitude . That isle</l>
       <l n="15">Some solitary man in other times</l>
       <l n="16">Had made his dwelling-place ; and Henry found</l>
       <l n="17">The little chapel that his toil had built</l>
       <l n="18">Now by the storms unroofed , his bed of leaves</l>
       <l n="19">Wind-scattered , and his grave o'ergrown with grass ,</l>
       <l n="20">And thistles , whose white seeds winged in vain</l>
       <l n="21">Withered on rocks , or in the waves were lost .</l>
       <l n="22">So he repaired the chapel 's ruined roof ,</l>
       <l n="23">Clear 'd the grey lichens from the altar-stone ,</l>
       <l n="24">And underneath a rock that shelter 'd him</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="26">The peasants from the shore would bring him food</l>

       <l n="28">He knew not in that utter solitude ,</l>
       <l n="29">Nor ever visited the haunts of men</l>
       <l n="30">Save when some sinful wretch on a sick bed</l>
       <l n="31">Implored his blessing and his aid in death .</l>
       <l n="32">That summons he delayed not to obey ,</l>

       <l n="35">Albeit relying on his saintly load ,</l>
       <l n="36">Grew pale to see the peril . So he lived</l>

       <l n="45">More self-condemning fervour rais 'd his voice</l>
       <l n="46">For pardon for that sin , ‘ till that the sin</l>

       <l n="51">Alarmed at that unusual hour to hear</l>
       <l n="52">Its toll irregular , a monk arose .</l>
       <l n="53">The boatmen bore him willingly across</l>

     <p>English Eclogues .</p>
     <p>The following Eclogues I believe , bear no resemblance to any poems in our language . This species of composition has become popular in Germany , and I was induced to attempt by an account of the German Idylls given me in conversation . They cannot properly be stiled imitations , as I am ignorant of that language at present , and have never seen any translations or specimens in this kind .</p>
     <p>With bad Eclogues I am sufficiently acquainted , from ? ? tyrus<span corresp="#note1_5" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>and Corydon down to our English Strephons and Thirsises . No kind of poetry can boast of more illustrious names or is more distinguished by the servile dulness of imitated nonsense . Pastoral writers “ more silly than their sheep ” have like their sheep gone on in the same track one after another . Gay stumbled into a new path . His eclogues were the only ones that interested me when I was a boy , and did not know they were burlesque . The subject would furnish matter for a long essay , but this is not the place for it .</p>
     <p>How far poems requiring almost a colloquial plainness of language may accord with the public taste I am doubtful . They have been subjected to able criticism and revised with care . I have endeavoured to make them true to nature .</p>

     <p>THE OLD MANSION-HOUSE .</p>
     <p>STRANGER . Old friend ! why you seem bent on parish duty , Breaking the highway stones ,— and ‘ tis a task Somewhat too hard methinks for age like yours .</p>
     <p>OLD MAN . Why yes ! for one with such a weight of years Upon his back . I 've lived here , man and boy , In this same parish , near the age of man For I am hard upon threescore and ten . I can remember sixty years ago The beautifying of this mansion here When my late Lady 's father , the old Squire Came to the estate .</p>
     <p>STRANGER . Why then you have outlasted All his improvements , for you see they 're making Great alterations here .</p>
     <p>OLD MAN . Aye-great indeed ! And if my poor old Lady could rise up — God rest her soul ! ‘ twould grieve her to behold The wicked work is here .</p>
     <p>STRANGER . They 've set about it In right good earnest . All the front is gone , Here 's to be turf they tell me , and a road Round to the door . There were some yew trees too Stood in the court .</p>
     <p>OLD MAN . Aye Master ! fine old trees ! My grandfather could just remember back When they were planted there . It was my task To keep them trimm 'd , and ‘ twas a pleasure to me ! All strait and smooth , and like a great green wall ! My poor old Lady many a time would come And tell me where to shear , for she had played In childhood under them , and ‘ twas her pride To keep them in their beauty . Plague I say On their new-fangled whimsies ! we shall have A modern shrubbery here stuck full of firs And your pert poplar trees ;— I could as soon Have plough 'd my father 's grave as cut them down !</p>
     <p>STRANGER . But ‘ twill be lighter and more chearful now , A fine smooth turf , and with a gravel road Round for the carriage ,— now it suits my taste . I like a shrubbery too , it looks so fresh , And then there 's some variety about it . In spring the lilac and the gueldres rose , And the laburnum with its golden flowers Waving in the wind . And when the autumn comes The bright red berries of the mountain ash , With firs enough in winter to look green , And show that something lives . Sure this is better Than a great hedge of yew that makes it look All the year round like winter , and for ever Dropping its poisonous leaves from the under boughs So dry and bare !</p>
     <p>OLD MAN . Ah ! so the new Squire thinks And pretty work he makes of it ! what ‘ tis To have a stranger come to an old house !</p>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>STRANGER .</head>
       <l n="1">It seems you know him not ?</l>
     </lg>
     <p>OLD MAN . No Sir , not I . They tell me he 's expected daily now , But in my Lady 's time he never came But once , for they were very distant kin . If he had played about here when a child In that fore court , and eat the yew-berries , And sat in the porch threading the jessamine flowers , That fell so thick , he had not had the heart To mar all thus .</p>
     <p>STRANGER . Come — come ! all a not wrong . Those old dark windows —</p>
     <p>OLD MAN . They 're demolish 'd too — As if he could not see thro ’ casement glass ! The very red-breasts that so regular Came to my Lady for her morning crumbs , Wo n't know the window now !</p>
     <p>STRANGER . Nay they were high And then so darken 'd up with jessamine , Harbouring the vermine ;— that was a fine tree However . Did it not grow in and line The porch ?</p>
     <p>OLD MAN . All over it : it did one good To pass within ten yards when ‘ twas in blossom . There was a sweet-briar too that grew beside . My Lady loved at evening to sit there And knit ; and her old dog lay at her feet And slept in the sun ; ‘ twas an old favourite dog She did not love him less that he was old And feeble , and he always had a place By the fire-side , and when he died at last She made me dig a grave in the garden for him . Ah I she was good to all ! a woful day ‘ Twas for the poor when to her grave she went !</p>
     <p>STRANGER . They lost a friend then ?</p>
     <p>OLD MAN . You 're a stranger here Or would not ask that question . Were they sick ? She had rare cordial waters , and for herbs She could have taught the Doctors . Then at winter When weekly she distributed the bread In the poor old porch , to see her and to hear The blessings on her ! and I warrant them They were a blessing to her when her wealth Had been no comfort else . At Christmas , Sir ! It would have warm 'd your heart if you had seen Her Christmas kitchen ,— how the blazing fire Made her fine pewter shine , and holly boughs So chearful red ,— and as for misseltoe , The finest bough that grew in the country round Was mark 'd for Madam . Then her old ale went So bountiful about ! a Christmas cask , And ‘ twas a noble one ! God help me Sir ! But I shall never see such days again .</p>
     <p>STRANGER . Things may be better yet than you suppose And you should hope the best .</p>
     <p>OLD MAN . It do n't look well These alterations Sir ! I 'm an old man And love the good old fashions ; we do n't find Old bounty in new houses . They 've destroyed All that my Lady loved ; her favourite walk Grubb 'd up , and they do say that the great row Of elms behind the house , that meet a-top They must fall too . Well ! well ! I did not think To live to see all this , and ‘ tis perhaps A comfort I sha n't live to see it long .</p>
     <p>STRANGER . But sure all changes are not needs for the worse My friend .</p>
     <p>OLD MAN . May-hap they may n't Sir ;— for all that I like what I 've been us 'd to . I remember All this from a child up , and now to lose it , ‘ Tis losing an old friend . There 's nothing left As ‘ twas ;— I go abroad and only meet With men whose fathers I remember boys ; The brook that used to run before my door That 's gone to the great pond ; the trees I learnt To climb are down ; and I see nothing now That tells me of old times , except the stones In the church-yard . You are young Sir and I hope Have many years in store ,— but pray to God You may n't be left the last of all your friends .</p>
     <p>STRANGER . Well ! well ! you 've one friend more than you 're aware of . If the Squire 's taste do n't suit with your 's , I warrant That 's all you 'll quarrel with : walk in and taste His beer , old friend ! and see if your old Lady E'er broached a better cask . You did not know me , But we 're acquainted now . ‘ Twould not be easy To make you like the outside ; but within — That is not changed my friend ! you 'll always find The same old bounty and old welcome there .</p>

      <head>THE GRANDMOTHERS TALE .</head>
      <head>JANE . Harry ! I 'm tired of playing . We 'll draw round The fire , and Grandmamma perhaps will tell us One of her stories .</head>
      <head>HARRY . Aye — dear Grandmamma ! A pretty story ! something dismal now ; A bloody murder .</head>
       <l n="1">JANE .</l>
       <l n="2">Or about a ghost .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>GRANDMOTHER . Nay , nay , I should but frighten you . You know The other night when I was telling you About the light in the church-yard , how you trembled Because the screech-owl hooted at the window , And would not go to bed .</p>
     <p>JANE . Why Grandmamma You said yourself you did not like to hear him . Pray now ! we wo'nt be frightened .</p>
     <p>GRANDMOTHER . Well , well , children ! But you 've heard all my stories . Let me see ,— Did I never tell you how the smuggler murdered The woman down at Pill ?</p>
     <p>HARRY . No — never ! never !</p>
     <p>GRANDMOTHER . Not how he cut her head off in the stable ?</p>
     <p>HARRY . Oh — now ! do tell us that !</p>
     <p>GRANDMOTHER . You must have heard Your Mother , children ! often tell of her . She used to weed in the garden here , and worm Your uncle 's dogs<span corresp="#note1_6" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>, and serve the house with coal ; And glad enough she was in winter time To drive her asses here ! it was cold work To follow the slow beasts thro ’ sleet and snow , And here she found a comfortable meal And a brave fire to thaw her , for poor Moll Was always welcome .</p>
     <p>HARRY . Oh — ‘ twas blear-eyed Moll The collier woman ,— a great ugly woman , I 've heard of her .</p>
     <p>GRANDMOTHER . Ugly enough poor soul ! At ten yards distance you could hardly tell If it were man or woman , for her voice Was rough as our old mastiff 's , and she wore A man 's old coat and hat ,— and then her face ! There was a merry story told of her , How when the press-gang came to take her husband As they were both in bed , she heard them coming , Drest John up in her night-cap , and herself Put on his clothes and went before the Captain .</p>
     <p>JANE . And so they prest a woman !</p>
     <p>GRANDMOTHER . ‘ Twas a trick She dearly loved to tell , and all the country Soon knew the jest , for she was used to travel For miles around . All weathers and all hours She crossed the hill , as hardy as her beasts , Bearing the wind and rain and winter frosts , And if she did not reach her home at night She laid her down in the stable with her asses And slept as sound as they did .</p>
     <p>HARRY . With her asses !</p>
     <p>GRANDMOTHER . Yes , and she loved her beasts . For tho ’ poor wretch She was a terrible reprobate and swore Like any trooper , she was always good To the dumb creatures , never loaded them Beyond their strength , and rather I believe Would stint herself than let the poor beasts want , Because , she said , they could not ask for food . I never saw her stick fall heavier on them Than just with its own weight . She little thought This tender-heartedness would be her death ! There was a fellow who had oftentimes , As if he took delight in cruelty . Ill-used her Asses . He was one who lived By smuggling , and , for she had often met him Crossing the down at night , she threatened him , If he tormented them again , to inform Of his unlawful ways . Well — so it was — ‘ Twas what they both were born to , he provoked her , She laid an information , and one morn They found her in the stable , her throat cut From ear to ear ,' till the head only hung Just by a bit of skin .</p>
     <p>JANE . Oh dear ! oh dear !</p>
     <p>HARRY . I hope they hung the man !</p>
     <p>GRANDMOTHER . They took him up ; There was no proof , no one had seen the deed , And he was set at liberty . But God Whoss eye beholdeth all things , he had seen The murder , and the murderer knew that God Was witness to his crime . He fled the place , But nowhere could he fly the avenging hand Of heaven , but nowhere could the murderer rest , A guilty conscience haunted him , by day , By night , in company , in solitude , Restless and wretched , did he bear upon him The weight of blood ; her cries were in his ears , Her stifled groans as when he knelt upon her Always he heard ; always he saw her stand Before his eyes ; even in the dead of night Distinctly seen as tho ’ in the broad sun , She stood beside the murderer 's bed and yawn 'd Her ghastly wound ; till life itself became A punishment at last he could not bear , And he confess 'd<span corresp="#note2_4" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>it all , and gave himself To death , so terrible , he said , it was To have a guilty conscience !</p>
     <p>HARRY . Was he hung then ?</p>
     <p>GRANDMOTHER . Hung and anatomized . Poor wretched man , Your uncles went to see him on his trial , He was so pale , so thin , so hollow-eyed , And such a horror in his meagre face , They said he look 'd like one who never slept . He begg 'd the prayers of all who saw his end And met his death with fears that well might warn From guilt , tho ’ not without a hope in Christ .</p>
     <note xml:id="note1_7" place="bottom" n="1">I know not whether this cruel and stupid custom is common in other parts of England . It is supposed to prevent the dogs from doing any mischief should they afterwards become mad .</note>
     <note xml:id="note2_4" place="bottom" n="2">There must be many persons living who remember these circumstances . They happened two or three and twenty years ago , in the neighbourhood of Bristol . The woman 's name was Bees .

      <head>THE FUNERAL .</head>
       <l n="1">The coffin<span corresp="#note1_7" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>as I past across the lane</l>
       <l n="2">Came sudden on my view . It was not here ,</l>
       <l n="3">A sight of every day , as in the streets</l>
       <l n="4">Of the great city , and we paus 'd and ask 'd</l>
       <l n="5">Who to the grave was going . It was one ,</l>
       <l n="6">A village girl , they told us , who had borne</l>
       <l n="7">An eighteen months strange illness , and had pined</l>
       <l n="8">With such slow wasting that the hour of death</l>
       <l n="9">Came welcome to her . We pursued our way</l>
       <l n="10">To the house of mirth , and with that idle talk</l>
       <l n="11">That passes o'er the mind and is forgot ,</l>
       <l n="12">We wore away the time . But it was eve</l>
       <l n="13">When homewardly I went , and in the air</l>
       <l n="14">Was that cool freshness , that discolouring shade</l>
       <l n="15">That makes the eye turn inward . Then I heard</l>
       <l n="16">Over the vale the heavy toll of death</l>
       <l n="17">Sound slow ; it made me think upon the dead ,</l>
       <l n="18">I questioned more and learnt her sorrowful tale .</l>
       <l n="19">She bore unhusbanded a mother 's name ,</l>
       <l n="20">And he who should have cherished her , far off</l>
       <l n="21">Sail 'd on the seas , self-exil 'd from his home ,</l>
       <l n="22">For he was poor . Left thus , a wretched one ,</l>
       <l n="23">Scorn made a mock of her , and evil tongues</l>
       <l n="24">Were busy with her name . She had one ill</l>
       <l n="25">Heavier , neglect , forgetfulness from him</l>
       <l n="26">Whom she had loved so dearly . Once he wrote ,</l>
       <l n="27">But only once that drop of comfort came</l>
       <l n="28">To mingle with her cup of wretchedness ;</l>
       <l n="29">And when his parents had some tidings from him ,</l>
       <l n="30">There was no mention of poor Hannah there ,</l>
       <l n="31">Or ‘ twas the cold enquiry , bitterer</l>
       <l n="32">Than silence . So she pined and pined away</l>
       <l n="33">And for herself and baby toil 'd and toil 'd ,</l>
       <l n="34">Nor did she , even on her death bed , rest</l>
       <l n="35">From labour , knitting with her outstretch 'd arms</l>
       <l n="36">Till she sunk with very weakness . Her old mother</l>
       <l n="37">Omitted no kind office , and she work 'd</l>
       <l n="38">Hard , and with hardest working barely earn 'd</l>
       <l n="39">Enough to make life struggle and prolong</l>
       <l n="40">The pains of grief and sickness . Thus she lay</l>
       <l n="41">On the sick bed of poverty , so worn</l>
       <l n="42">With her long suffering and that painful thought</l>
       <l n="43">That at her heart lay rankling , and so weak ,</l>
       <l n="44">That she could make no effort to express</l>
       <l n="45">Affection for her infant ; and the child ,</l>
       <l n="46">Whose lisping love perhaps had solaced her</l>
       <l n="47">With a strange infantine ingratitude</l>
       <l n="48">Shunn 'd her as one indifferent . She was past</l>
       <l n="49">That anguish , for she felt her hour draw on ,</l>
       <l n="50">And ‘ twas her only comfoft now to think</l>
       <l n="51">Upon the grave . “ Poor girl ! ” her mother said ,</l>
       <l n="52">“ Thou hast suffered much ! ” “ aye mother ! there is none</l>
       <l n="53">“ Can tell what I have suffered ! ” she replied ,</l>
       <l n="54">“ But I shall soon be where the weary rest . ”</l>
       <l n="55">And she did rest her soon , for it pleased God</l>
       <l n="56">To take her to his mercy .</l>

     <note xml:id="note1_8" place="bottom" n="1">It is proper to remark that the story related in this Eclogue is strictly true . I met the funeral , and learnt the circumstances in a village in Hampshire . The indifference of the child was mentioned to me ; indeed no addition whatever has been made to the story . I should have thought it wrong to have weakened the effect of a faithful narrative by adding any thing .</note>
     <p>ECLOGUE IV .</p>
     <p>THE SAILOR 'S MOTHER .</p>
     <p>WOMAN . Sir for the love of God some small relief To a poor woman !</p>
     <p>TRAVELLER . Whither are you bound ? ‘ Tis a late hour to travel o'er these downs , No house for miles around us , and the way Dreary and wild . The evening wind already Makes one 's teeth chatter , and the very Sun , Setting so pale behind those thin white clouds , Looks cold . ‘ Twill be a bitter night !</p>
     <p>WOMAN . Aye Sir ‘ Tis cutting keen ! I smart at every breath , Heaven knows how I shall reach my journey 's end , For the way is long before me , and my feet , God help me ! sore with travelling . I would gladly , If it pleased God , lie down at once and die .</p>
     <p>TRAVELLER . Nay nay cheer up ! a little food and rest Will comfort you ; and then your journey 's end Will make amends for all . You shake your head , And weep . Is it some evil business then That leads you from your home ?</p>
     <p>WOMAN . Sir I am going To see my son at Plymouth , sadly hurt In the late action , and in the hospital Dying , I fear me , now .</p>
     <p>TRAVELLER . Perhaps your fears Make evil worse . Even if a limb be lost There may be still enough for comfort left An arm or leg shot off , there 's yet the heart To keep life warm , and he may live to talk With pleasure of the glorious fight that maim 'd him , Proud of his loss . Old England 's gratitude Makes the maim 'd sailor happy .</p>
     <p>WOMAN . ‘ Tis not that — An arm or leg — I could have borne with that . ‘ Twas not a ball , it was some cursed thing That bursts<span corresp="#note1_8" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>and burns that hurt him . Something Sir They do not use on board our English ships It is so wicked !</p>
     <p>TRAVELLER . Rascals ! a mean art Of cruel cowardice , yet all in vain !</p>
     <p>WOMAN . Yes Sir ! and they should show no mercy to them For making use of such unchristian arms . I had a letter from the hospital , He got some friend to write it , and he tells me That my poor boy has lost his precious eyes , Burnt out . Alas ! that I should ever live To see this wretched day !— they tell me Sir There is no cure for wounds like his . Indeed ‘ Tis a hard journey that I go upon To such a dismal end !</p>
     <p>TRAVELLER . He yet may live . But if the worst should chance , why you must bear The will of heaven with patience . Were it not Some comfort to reflect your son has fallen Fighting his country 's cause ? and for yourself You will not in unpitied poverty Be left to mourn his loss . Your grateful country Amid the triumph of her victory Remember those who paid its price of blood , And with a noble charity relieves The widow and the orphan .</p>
     <p>WOMAN . God reward them ! God bless them , it will help me in my age But Sir ! it will not pay me for my child !</p>
     <p>TRAVELLER . Was he your only child ?</p>
     <p>WOMAN . My only one , The stay and comfort of my widowhood , A dear good boy !— when first he went to sea I felt what it would come to ,— something told me I should be childless soon . But tell me Sir If it be true that for a hurt like his There is no cure ? please God to spare his life Tho ’ he be blind , yet I should be so thankful ! I can remember there was a blind man Lived in our village , one from his youth up Quite dark , and yet he was a merry man , And he had none to tend on him so well As I would tend my boy !</p>
     <p>TRAVELLER . Of this be sure His hurts are look 'd to well , and the best help The place affords , as rightly is his due , Ever at hand . How happened it he left you ? Was a seafaring life his early choice ?</p>
     <p>WOMAN . No Sir ! poor fellow — he was wise enough To be content at home , and ‘ twas a home As comfortable Sir I even tho ’ I say it , As any in the country . He was left A little boy when his poor father died , Just old enough to totter by himself And call his mother 's name . We two were all , And as we were not left quite destitute We bore up well . In the summer time I worked Sometimes a-field . Then I was famed for knitting , And in long winter nights my spinning wheel Seldom stood still . We had kind neighbours too And never felt distress . So he grew up A comely lad and wonderous well disposed ; I taught him well ; there was not in the parish A child who said his prayers more regular , Or answered readier thro ’ his catechism . If I had foreseen this ! but ‘ tis a blessing We do'nt know what we 're born to !</p>
     <p>TRAVELLER . But how came it He chose to be a Sailor ?</p>
     <p>WOMAN . You shall hear Sir ; As he grew up he used to watch the birds In the corn , child 's work you know , and easily done . ‘ Tis an idle sort of task , so he built up A little hut of wicker-work and clay Under the hedge , to shelter him in rain . And then he took for very idleness To making traps to catch the plunderers , All sorts of cunning traps that boys can make — Propping a stone to fall and shut them in , Or crush them with its weight , or else a springe Swung on a bough . He made them cleverly — And I , poor foolish woman ! I was pleased To see the boy so handy . You may guess What followed Sir from this unlucky skill . He did what he should not when he was older : I warn 'd him oft enough ; but he was caught In wiring hares at last , and had his choice The prison or the ship .</p>
     <p>TRAVELLER . The choice at least Was kindly left him , and for broken laws This was methinks no heavy punishment .</p>
     <p>WOMAN . So I was told Sir . And I tried to think so , But ‘ twas a sad blow to me ! I was used To sleep at nights soundly and undisturb 'd — Now if the wind blew rough , it made me start And think of my poor boy tossing about Upon the roaring seas . And then I seem 'd To feel that it was hard to take him from me For such a little fault . But he was wrong Oh very wrong — a murrain on his traps ! See what they 've brought him too !</p>
     <p>TRAVELLER . Well ! well ! take comfort He will be taken care of if he lives ; And should you lose your child , this is a country Where the brave sailor never leaves a parent To weep for him in want .</p>
     <p>WOMAN . Sir I shall want No succour long . In the common course of years I soon must be at rest , and ‘ tis a comfort When grief is hard upon me to reflect It only leads me to that rest the sooner .</p>
     <note xml:id="note1_9" place="bottom" n="1">The stink-pots used on board the French ships . In the engagement between the Mars and L'Hercule , some of our sailors were shockingly mangled by them : One in particular , as described in the Eclogue , lost both his eyes . It would be policy and humanity to employ means of destruction , could they be discovered , powerful enough to destroy fleets and armies , but to use any thing that only inflicts additional torture upon the victims of our war systems , is cruel and wicked .</note>
     <p>ECLOGUE V .</p>
     <p>THE WITCH .</p>
     <p>NATHANIEL . Father ! here father ! I have found a horse-shoe ! Faith it was just in time , for t'other night I laid two straws across at Margery 's door , And afterwards I fear 'd that she might do me A mischief for't . There was the Miller 's boy Who set his dog at that black cat of hers , I met him upon crutches , and he told me ‘ Twas all her evil eye .</p>
     <p>FATHER . ‘ Tis rare good luck ; I would have gladly given a crown for one If t'would have done as well . But where did'st find it ?</p>
     <p>NATHANIEL . Down on the Common ; I was going a-field And neighbour Saunders pass 'd me on his mare ; He had hardly said “ good day , ” before I saw The shoe drop off ; ‘ twas just upon my tongue To call him back ,— it makes no difference , does it . Because I know whose ‘ twas ?</p>
     <p>FATHER . Why no , it can n't . The shoe 's the same you know , and you ‘ did find ’ it .</p>
     <p>NATHANIEL . That mare of his has got a plaguey road To travel , father , and if he should lame her , For she is but tender-footed ,—</p>
     <p>FATHER . Aye , indeed — I should not like to see her limping back Poor beast ! but charity begins at home , And Nat , there 's our own horse in such a way This morning !</p>
     <p>NATHANIEL . Why he ha'nt been rid again ! Last night I hung a pebble by the manger With a hole thro ’ , and every body says That ‘ tis a special charm against the hags .</p>
     <p>FATHER . It could not be a proper natural hole then , Or ‘ twas not a right pebble ,— for I found him Smoking with sweat , quaking in every limb , And panting so ! God knows where he had been When we were all asleep , thro ’ bush and brake Up-hill and down-hill all alike , full stretch At such a deadly rate !—</p>
     <p>NATHANIEL . By land and water , Over the sea perhaps !— I have heard tell That ‘ tis some thousand miles , almost at the end Of the world , where witches go to meet the Devil . They used to ride on broomsticks , and to smear Some ointment over them and then away Out of the window ! but ‘ tis worse than all To worry the poor beasts so . Shame upon it That in a Christian country they should let Such creatures live !</p>
     <p>FATHER . And when there 's such plain proof ! I did but threaten her because she robb 'd Our hedge , and the next night there came a wind That made me shake to hear it in my bed ! How came it that that storm unroofed my barn , And only mine in the parish ? look at her And that 's enough ; she has it in her face — A pair of large dead eyes , rank in her head , Just like a corpse , and purs 'd with wrinkles round , A nose and chin that scarce leave room between For her lean fingers to squeeze in the snuff , And when she speaks ! I 'd sooner hear a raven Croak at my door ! she sits there , nose and knees Smoak-dried and shrivell 'd over a starved fire , With that black cat beside her , whose great eyes Shine like old Beelzebub 's , and to be sure It must be one of his imps !— aye , nail it hard .</p>
     <p>NATHANIEL . I wish old Margery heard the hammer go ! She 'd curse the music .</p>
     <p>FATHER . Here 's the Curate coming , He ought to rid the parish of such vermin ; In the old times they used to hunt them out And hang them without mercy , but Lord bless us ! The world is grown so wicked !</p>
     <p>CURATE . Good day Farmer ! Nathaniel what art nailing to the threshold ?</p>
     <p>NATHANIEL . A horse-shoe Sir , ‘ tis good to keep off witchcraft , And we 're afraid of Margery .</p>
     <p>CURATE . Poor old woman ! What can you fear from her ?</p>
     <p>FATHER . What can we fear ? Who lamed the Miller 's boy ? who rais 'd the wind That blew my old barn 's roof down ? who d'ye think Rides my poor horse a'nights ? who mocks the hounds ? But let me catch her at that trick again , And I 've a silver bullet ready for her , One that shall lame her , double how she will .</p>
     <p>NATHANIEL . What makes her sit there moping by herself , With no soul near her but that great black cat ? And do but look at her !</p>
     <p>CURATE . Poor wretch ! half blind And crooked with her years , without a child Or friend in her old age , ‘ tis hard indeed To have her very miseries made her crimes ! I met her but last week in that hard frost That made my young limbs ache , and when I ask 'd What brought her out in the snow , the poor old woman Told me that she was forced to crawl abroad And pick the hedges , just to keep herself From perishing with cold , because no neighbour Had pity on her age ; and then she cried , And said the children pelted her with snow-balls , And wish 'd that she were dead .</p>
     <p>FATHER . I wish she was ! She has plagued the parish long enough !</p>
     <p>CURATE . Shame farmer ! Is that the charity your bible teaches ?</p>
     <p>FATHER . My bible does not teach me to love witches . I know what 's charity ; who pays his tithes And poor-rates readier ?</p>
     <p>CURATE . Who can better do it ? You 've been a prudent and industrious man , And God has blest your labour .</p>
     <p>FATHER . Why , thank God Sir , I 've had no reason to complain of fortune .</p>
     <p>CURATE . Complain ! why you are wealthy . All the parish Look up to you .</p>
     <p>FATHER . Perhaps Sir , I could tell Guinea for guinea with the warmest of them .</p>
     <p>CURATE . You can afford a little to the poor , And then what 's better still , you have the heart To give from your abundance .</p>
     <p>FATHER . God forbid I should want charity !</p>
     <p>CURATE . Oh ! ‘ tis a comfort To think at last of riches well employ 'd ! I have been by a death-bed , and know the worth Of a good deed at that most awful hour When riches profit not . Farmer , I 'm going To visit Margery . She is sick I hear — Old , poor , and sick ! a miserable lot , And death will be a blessing . You might send her Some little matter , something comfortable , That she may go down easier to the grave And bless you when she dies .</p>
     <p>FATHER . What ! is she going ! Well God forgive her then ! if she has dealt In the black art . I 'll tell my dame of it , And she shall send her something .</p>
     <p>CURATE . So I 'll say ; And take my thanks for her 's . [ ‘ goes ’ ]</p>
     <p>FATHER . That 's a good man That Curate , Nat , of ours , to go and visit The poor in sickness ; but he do n't believe In witchcraft , and that is not like a christian .</p>
     <p>NATHANIEL . And so old Margery 's dying !</p>
     <p>FATHER . But you know She may recover ; so drive t'other nail in !</p>

       <l n="6">Peers taller , and uplifts its column 'd stem</l>
       <l n="7">Bright with the broad rose-blossoms . I have seen</l>
       <l n="8">Many a fallen convent reverend in decay ,</l>
       <l n="9">And many a time have trod the castle courts</l>
       <l n="10">And grass-green halls , yet never did they strike</l>
       <l n="11">Home to the heart such melancholy thoughts</l>
       <l n="12">As this poor cottage . Look , its little hatch</l>
       <l n="13">Fleeced with that grey and wintry moss ; the roof</l>
       <l n="14">Part mouldered in , the rest o'ergrown with weeds ,</l>
       <l n="15">House-leek and long thin grass and greener moss ;</l>
       <l n="16">So Nature wars with all the works of man .</l>
       <l n="17">And , like himself , reduces back to earth</l>
       <l n="18">His perishable piles .</l>
       <l n="19">I led thee here</l>
       <l n="20">Charles , not without design ; for this hath been</l>
       <l n="21">My favourite walk even since I was a boy ;</l>
       <l n="22">And I remember Charles , this ruin here ,</l>
       <l n="23">The neatest comfortable dwelling place !</l>
       <l n="24">That when I read in those dear books that first</l>
       <l n="25">Woke in my heart the love of poesy ,</l>
       <l n="26">How with the villagers Erminia dwelt ,</l>
       <l n="27">And Calidore for a fair shepherdess</l>
       <l n="28">Forgot his quest to learn the shepherd 's lore ;</l>
       <l n="29">My fancy drew from , this the little hut</l>
       <l n="30">Where that poor princess wept her hopeless love ,</l>
       <l n="31">Or where the gentle Calidore at eve</l>
       <l n="32">Led Pastorella home . There was not then</l>
       <l n="33">A weed where all these nettles overtop</l>
       <l n="34">The garden wall ; but sweet-briar , scenting sweet</l>
       <l n="35">The morning air , rosemary and marjoram ,</l>
       <l n="36">All wholesome herbs ; and then , that woodbine wreath 'd</l>
       <l n="37">So lavishly around the pillared porch</l>
       <l n="38">Its fragrant flowers , that when I past this way ,</l>
       <l n="39">After a truant absence hastening home ,</l>
       <l n="40">I could not chuse but pass with slacken 'd speed</l>
       <l n="41">By that delightful fragrance . Sadly changed</l>
       <l n="42">Is this poor cottage ! and its dwellers , Charles !—</l>
       <l n="43">Theirs is a simple melancholy tale ,</l>
       <l n="44">There 's scarce a village but can fellow it ,</l>
       <l n="45">And yet methinks it will not weary thee ,</l>
       <l n="46">And should not be untold .</l>
       <l n="47">A widow woman</l>
       <l n="48">Dwelt with her daughter here ; just above want ,</l>
       <l n="49">She lived on some small pittance that sufficed ,</l>
       <l n="50">In better times , the needful calls of life ,</l>
       <l n="51">Not without comfort . I remember her</l>
       <l n="52">Sitting at evening in that open door way</l>
       <l n="53">And spinning in the sun ; methinks I see her</l>
       <l n="54">Raising her eyes and dark-rimm 'd spectacles</l>
       <l n="55">To see the passer by , yet ceasing not</l>
       <l n="56">To twirl her lengthening thread . Or in the garden</l>
       <l n="57">On some dry summer evening , walking round</l>
       <l n="58">To view her flowers , and pointing , as she lean 'd</l>
       <l n="59">Upon the ivory handle of her stick ,</l>
       <l n="60">To some carnation whose o'erheavy head</l>
       <l n="61">Needed support , while with the watering-pot</l>
       <l n="62">Joanna followed , and refresh 'd and trimm 'd</l>
       <l n="63">The drooping plant ; Joanna , her dear child ,</l>
       <l n="64">As lovely and as happy then as youth</l>
       <l n="65">And innocence could make her .</l>
       <l n="66">Charles ! it seems</l>
       <l n="67">As tho ’ I were a boy again , and all</l>
       <l n="68">The mediate years with their vicissitudes</l>
       <l n="69">A half-forgotten dream . I see the Maid</l>
       <l n="70">So comely in her Sunday dress ! her hair ,</l>
       <l n="71">Her bright brown hair , wreath 'd in contracting curls ,</l>
       <l n="72">And then her cheek ! it was a red and white</l>
       <l n="73">That made the delicate hues of art look loathsome ,</l>
       <l n="74">The countrymen who on their way to church</l>
       <l n="75">Were leaning o'er the bridge , loitering to hear</l>
       <l n="76">The bell 's last summons , and in idleness</l>
       <l n="77">Watching the stream below , would all look up</l>
       <l n="78">When she pass 'd by . And her old Mother , Charles !</l>
       <l n="79">When I have beard some erring infidel</l>
       <l n="80">Speak of our faith as of a gloomy creed ,</l>
       <l n="81">Inspiring fear and boding wretchedness .</l>
       <l n="82">Her figure has recurr 'd ; for she did love</l>
       <l n="83">The sabbath-day , and many a time has cross 'd</l>
       <l n="84">These fields in rain and thro ’ the winter snows .</l>
       <l n="85">When I , a graceless boy , wishing myself</l>
       <l n="86">By the fire-side , have wondered why ‘ she ’ came</l>
       <l n="87">Who might have sate at home .</l>
       <l n="88">One only care</l>
       <l n="89">Hung on her aged spirit . For herself ,</l>
       <l n="90">Her path was plain before her , and the close</l>
       <l n="91">Of her long journey near . But then her child</l>
       <l n="92">Soon to be left alone in this bad world ,—</l>
       <l n="93">That was a thought that many a winter night</l>
       <l n="94">Had kept her sleepless : and when prudent love</l>
       <l n="95">In something better than a servant 's slate</l>
       <l n="96">Had placed her well at last , it was a pang</l>
       <l n="97">Like parting life to part with her dear girl .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="98">One summer , Charles , when at the holydays</l>
       <l n="99">Return 'd from school , I visited again</l>
       <l n="100">My old accustomed walks , and found in them .</l>
       <l n="101">A joy almost like meeting an old friend ,</l>
       <l n="102">I saw the cottage empty , and the weeds</l>
       <l n="103">Already crowding the neglected flowers .</l>
       <l n="104">Joanna by a villain 's wiles seduced</l>
       <l n="105">Had played the wanton , and that blow had reach 'd</l>
       <l n="106">Her mother 's heart . She did not suffer long ,</l>
       <l n="107">Her age was feeble , and the heavy blow</l>
       <l n="108">Brought her grey hairs with sorrow to the grave .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="109">I pass this ruin 'd dwelling oftentimes</l>
       <l n="110">And think of other days . It wakes in me</l>
       <l n="111">A transient sadness , but the feelings Charles</l>
       <l n="112">That ever with these recollections rise ,</l>
       <l n="113">I trust in God they will not pass away .</l>
