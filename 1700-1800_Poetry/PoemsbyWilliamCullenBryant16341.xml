     <l n="2">Oh , deem not they are blest alone</l>
     <l n="3">Whose lives a peaceful tenor keep ;</l>
     <l n="4">The Power who pities man , has shown</l>
     <l n="5">A blessing for the eyes that weep .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">The light of smiles shall fill again</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="10">There is a day of sunny rest</l>

     <l n="14">And thou , who , o'er thy friend 's low bier ,</l>

     <l n="22">For God has marked each sorrowing day</l>

     <l n="27">When he , who , from the scourge of wrong ,</l>
     <l n="28">Aroused the Hebrew tribes to fly ,</l>

     <l n="31">God made his grave , to men unknown ,</l>

    <head>A WALK AT SUNSET .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">When insect wings are glistening in the beam</l>
     <l n="2">Of the low sun , and mountain-tops are bright ,</l>
     <l n="3">Oh , let me , by the crystal valley-stream ,</l>
     <l n="4">Wander amid the mild and mellow light ;</l>
     <l n="5">And while the wood-thrush pipes his evening lay ,</l>
     <l n="6">Give me one lonely hour to hymn the setting day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Oh , sun ! that o'er the western mountains now</l>
     <l n="8">Goest down in glory ! ever beautiful</l>
     <l n="9">And blessed is thy radiance , whether thou</l>
     <l n="10">Colourest the eastern heaven and night-mist cool ,</l>
     <l n="11">Till the bright day-star vanish , or on high</l>
     <l n="12">Climbest and streamest thy white splendours from mid-sky .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">Yet , loveliest are thy setting smiles , and fair ,</l>
     <l n="14">Fairest of all that earth beholds , the hues</l>
     <l n="15">That live among the clouds , and flush the air ,</l>
     <l n="16">Lingering and deepening at the hour of dews .</l>
     <l n="17">Then softest gales are breathed , and softest heard</l>
     <l n="18">The plaining voice of streams , and pensive note of bird .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">They who here roamed , of yore , the forest wide ,</l>
     <l n="20">Felt , by such charm , their simple bosoms won ;</l>
     <l n="21">They deemed their quivered warrior , when he died ,</l>
     <l n="22">Went to bright isles beneath the setting sun ;</l>
     <l n="23">Where winds are aye at peace , and skies are fair ,</l>
     <l n="24">And purple-skirted clouds curtain the crimson air .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">So , with the glories of the dying day ,</l>
     <l n="26">Its thousand trembling lights and changing hues ,</l>
     <l n="27">The memory of the brave who passed away</l>
     <l n="28">Tenderly mingled ;— fitting hour to muse</l>
     <l n="29">On such grave theme , and sweet the dream that shed</l>
     <l n="30">Brightness and beauty round the destiny of the dead .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="31">For ages , on the silent forests here ,</l>
     <l n="32">Thy beams did fall before the red man came</l>
     <l n="33">To dwell beneath them ; in their shade the deer</l>
     <l n="34">Fed , and feared not the arrow 's deadly aim .</l>
     <l n="35">Nor tree was felled , in all that world of woods ,</l>
     <l n="36">Save by the beaver 's tooth , or winds , or rush of floods .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="37">Then came the hunter tribes , and thou didst look ,</l>
     <l n="38">For ages , on their deeds in the hard chase ,</l>
     <l n="39">And well-fought wars ; green sod and silver brook</l>
     <l n="40">Took the first stain of blood ; before thy face</l>
     <l n="41">The warrior generations came and passed ,</l>
     <l n="42">And glory was laid up for many an age to last .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="43">Now they are gone , gone as thy setting blaze</l>
     <l n="44">Goes down the west , while night is pressing on ,</l>
     <l n="45">And with them the old tale of better days ,</l>
     <l n="46">And trophies of remembered power , are gone .</l>
     <l n="47">Yon field that gives the harvest , where the plough</l>
     <l n="48">Strikes the white bone , is all that tells their story now .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="49">I stand upon their ashes in thy beam ,</l>
     <l n="50">The offspring of another race , I stand ,</l>
     <l n="51">Beside a stream they loved , this valley stream ;</l>
     <l n="52">And where the night-fire of the quivered band</l>
     <l n="53">Showed the gray oak by fits , and war-song rung ,</l>
     <l n="54">I teach the quiet shades the strains of this new tongue .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="55">Farewell ! but thou shalt come again — thy light</l>
     <l n="56">Must shine on other changes , and behold</l>
     <l n="57">The place of the thronged city still as night —</l>
     <l n="58">States fallen — new empires built upon the old —</l>
     <l n="59">But never shalt thou see these realms again</l>
     <l n="60">Darkened by boundless groves , and roamed by savage men .</l>

    <head>HYMN TO DEATH .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Oh ! could I hope the wise and pure in heart</l>
     <l n="2">Might hear my song without a frown , nor deem</l>
     <l n="3">My voice unworthy of the theme it tries ,—</l>
     <l n="4">I would take up the hymn to Death , and say</l>
     <l n="5">To the grim power : The world hath slandered thee</l>
     <l n="6">And mocked thee . On thy dim and shadowy brow</l>
     <l n="7">They place an iron crown , and call thee king</l>
     <l n="8">Of terrors , and the spoiler of the world ,</l>
     <l n="9">Deadly assassin , that strik'st down the fair ,</l>
     <l n="10">The loved , the good — that breathest on the lights</l>
     <l n="11">Of virtue set along the vale of life ,</l>
     <l n="12">And they go out in darkness . I am come ,</l>
     <l n="13">Not with reproaches , not with cries and prayers ,</l>
     <l n="14">Such as have stormed thy stern , insensible ear</l>
     <l n="15">from the beginning . I am come to speak</l>
     <l n="16">Thy praises . True it is , that I have wept</l>
     <l n="17">Thy conquests , and may weep them yet again :</l>
     <l n="18">And thou from some I love wilt take a life</l>
     <l n="19">Dear to me as my own . Yet while the spell</l>
     <l n="20">Is on my spirit , and I talk with thee</l>
     <l n="21">In sight of all thy trophies , face to face ,</l>
     <l n="22">Meet is it that my voice should utter forth</l>
     <l n="23">Thy nobler triumphs ; I will teach the world</l>
     <l n="24">To thank thee .— Who are thine accusers ?— Who ?</l>
     <l n="25">The living !— they who never felt thy power ,</l>
     <l n="26">And know thee not . The curses of the wretch</l>
     <l n="27">Whose crimes are ripe , his sufferings when thy hand</l>
     <l n="28">Is on him , and the hour he dreads is come ,</l>
     <l n="29">Are writ among thy praises . But the good —</l>
     <l n="30">Does he whom thy kind hand dismissed to peace ,</l>
     <l n="31">Upbraid the gentle violence that took off</l>
     <l n="32">His fetters , and unbarred his prison cell ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="33">Raise then the hymn to Death . Deliverer !</l>
     <l n="34">God hath anointed thee to free the oppressed</l>
     <l n="35">And crush the oppressor . When the armed chief ,</l>
     <l n="36">The conqueror of nations , walks the world ,</l>
     <l n="37">And it is changed beneath his feet , and all</l>
     <l n="38">Its kingdoms melt into one mighty realm —</l>
     <l n="39">Thou , while his head is loftiest and his heart</l>
     <l n="40">Blasphemes , imagining his own right hand</l>
     <l n="41">Almighty , thou dost set thy sudden grasp</l>
     <l n="42">Upon him , and the links of that strong chain</l>
     <l n="43">That bound mankind are crumbled ; thou dost break</l>
     <l n="44">Sceptre and crown , and beat his throne to dust .</l>
     <l n="45">Then the earth shouts with gladness , and her tribes</l>
     <l n="46">Gather within their ancient bounds again .</l>
     <l n="47">Else had the mighty of the olden time ,</l>
     <l n="48">Nimrod , Sesostris , or the youth who feigned</l>
     <l n="49">His birth from Libyan Ammon , smitten yet</l>
     <l n="50">The nations with a rod of iron , and driven</l>
     <l n="51">Their chariot o'er our necks . Thou dost avenge ,</l>
     <l n="52">In thy good time , the wrongs of those who know</l>
     <l n="53">No other friend . Nor dost thou interpose</l>
     <l n="54">Only to lay the sufferer asleep ,</l>
     <l n="55">Where he who made him wretched troubles not</l>
     <l n="56">His rest — thou dost strike down his tyrant too .</l>
     <l n="57">Oh , there is joy when hands that held the scourge</l>
     <l n="58">Drop lifeless , and the pitiless heart is cold .</l>
     <l n="59">Thou too dost purge from earth its horrible</l>
     <l n="60">And old idolatries ;— from the proud fanes</l>
     <l n="61">Each to his grave their priests go out , till none</l>
     <l n="62">Is left to teach their worship ; then the fires</l>
     <l n="63">Of sacrifice are chilled , and the green moss</l>
     <l n="64">O'ercreeps their altars ; the fallen images</l>
     <l n="65">Cumber the weedy courts , and for loud hymns ,</l>
     <l n="66">Chanted by kneeling multitudes , the wind</l>
     <l n="67">Shrieks in the solitary aisles . When he</l>
     <l n="68">Who gives his life to guilt , and laughs at all</l>
     <l n="69">The laws that God or man has made , and round</l>
     <l n="70">Hedges his seat with power , and shines in wealth ,—</l>
     <l n="71">Lifts up his atheist front to scoff at Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="72">And celebrates his shame in open day ,</l>
     <l n="73">Thou , in the pride of all his crimes , cutt'st off</l>
     <l n="74">The horrible example . Touched by thine ,</l>
     <l n="75">The extortioner 's hard hand foregoes the gold</l>
     <l n="76">Wrung from the o'erhYpppHeNworn poor . The perjurer ,</l>
     <l n="77">Whose tongue was lithe , e'en now , and voluble</l>
     <l n="78">Against his neighbour 's life , and he who laughed</l>
     <l n="79">And leaped for joy to see a spotless fame</l>
     <l n="80">Blasted before his own foul calumnies ,</l>
     <l n="81">Are smit with deadly silence . He , who sold</l>
     <l n="82">His conscience to preserve a worthless life ,</l>
     <l n="83">Even while he hugs himself on his escape ,</l>
     <l n="84">Trembles , as , doubly terrible , at length ,</l>
     <l n="85">Thy steps o'ertake him , and there is no time</l>
     <l n="86">For parley — nor will bribes unclench thy grasp .</l>
     <l n="87">Oft , too , dost thou reform thy victim , long</l>
     <l n="88">Ere his last hour . And when the reveller ,</l>
     <l n="89">Mad in the chase of pleasure , stretches on ,</l>
     <l n="90">And strains each nerve , and clears the path of life</l>
     <l n="91">Like wind , thou point'st him to the dreadful goal ,</l>
     <l n="92">And shak'st thy hour-glass in his reeling eye ,</l>
     <l n="93">And check'st him in mid course . Thy skeleton hand</l>
     <l n="94">Shows to the faint of spirit the right path ,</l>
     <l n="95">And he is warned , and fears to step aside .</l>
     <l n="96">Thou sett'st between the ruffian and his crime</l>
     <l n="97">Thy ghastly countenance , and his slack hand</l>
     <l n="98">Drops the drawn knife . But , oh , most fearfully</l>
     <l n="99">Dost thou show forth Heaven 's justice , when thy shafts</l>
     <l n="100">Drink up the ebbing spirit — then the hard</l>
     <l n="101">Of heart and violent of hand restores</l>
     <l n="102">The treasure to the friendless wretch he wronged .</l>
     <l n="103">Then from the writhing bosom thou dost pluck</l>
     <l n="104">The guilty secret ; lips , for ages sealed ,</l>
     <l n="105">Are faithless to the dreadful trust at length ,</l>
     <l n="106">And give it up ; the felon 's latest breath</l>
     <l n="107">Absolves the innocent man who bears his crime ;</l>
     <l n="108">The slanderer , horror-smitten , and in tears ,</l>
     <l n="109">Recalls the deadly obloquy he forged</l>
     <l n="110">To work his brother 's ruin . Thou dost make</l>
     <l n="111">Thy penitent victim utter to the air</l>
     <l n="112">The dark conspiracy that strikes at life ,</l>
     <l n="113">And aims to whelm the laws ; ere yet the hour</l>
     <l n="114">Is come , and the dread sign of murder given .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="115">Thus , from the first of time , hast thou been found</l>
     <l n="116">On virtue 's side ; the wicked , but for thee ,</l>
     <l n="117">Had been too strong for the good ; the great of earth</l>
     <l n="118">Had crushed the weak for ever . Schooled in guile</l>
     <l n="119">For ages , while each passing year had brought</l>
     <l n="120">Its baneful lesson , they had filled the world</l>
     <l n="121">With their abominations ; while its tribes ,</l>
     <l n="122">Trodden to earth , imbruted , and despoiled ,</l>
     <l n="123">Had knelt to them in worship ; sacrifice</l>
     <l n="124">Had smoked on many an altar , temple roofs</l>
     <l n="125">Had echoed with the blasphemous prayer and hymn :</l>
     <l n="126">But thou , the great reformer of the world ,</l>
     <l n="127">Tak'st off the sons of violence and fraud</l>
     <l n="128">In their green pupilage , their lore half learned —</l>
     <l n="129">Ere guilt had quite o'errun the simple heart</l>
     <l n="130">God gave them at their birth , and blotted out</l>
     <l n="131">His image . Thou dost mark them flushed with hope ,</l>
     <l n="132">As on the threshold of their vast designs</l>
     <l n="133">Doubtful and loose they stand , and strik'st them down .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="134">Alas ! I little thought that the stern power</l>
     <l n="135">Whose fearful praise I sung , would try me thus</l>
     <l n="136">Before the strain was ended . It must cease —</l>
     <l n="137">For he is in his grave who taught my youth</l>
     <l n="138">The art of verse , and in the bud of life</l>
     <l n="139">Offered me to the muses . Oh , cut off</l>
     <l n="140">Untimely ! when thy reason in its strength ,</l>
     <l n="141">Ripened by years of toil and studious search ,</l>
     <l n="142">And watch of Nature 's silent lessons , taught</l>
     <l n="143">Thy hand to practise best the lenient art</l>
     <l n="144">To which thou gavest thy laborious days ,</l>
     <l n="145">And , last , thy life . And , therefore , when the earth</l>

    <head>SUMMER WIND .</head>
     <l n="1">It is a sultry day ; the sun has drunk</l>
     <l n="2">The dew that lay upon the morning grass ;</l>
     <l n="3">There is no rustling in the lofty elm</l>
     <l n="4">That canopies my dwelling , and its shade</l>
     <l n="5">Scarce cools me . All is silent , save the faint</l>
     <l n="6">And interrupted murmur of the bee ,</l>
     <l n="7">Settling on the sick flowers , and then again</l>
     <l n="8">Instantly on the wing . The plants around</l>
     <l n="9">Feel the too potent fervours : the tall maize</l>
     <l n="10">Rolls up its long green leaves ; the clover droops</l>
     <l n="11">Its tender foliage , and declines its blooms .</l>
     <l n="12">But far in the fierce sunshine tower the hills ,</l>
     <l n="13">With all their growth of woods , silent and stern ,</l>
     <l n="14">As if the scorching heat and dazzling light</l>
     <l n="15">Were but an element they loved . Bright clouds ,</l>
     <l n="16">Motionless pillars of the brazen heaven ,—</l>
     <l n="17">Their bases on the mountains — their white tops</l>
     <l n="18">Shining in the far ether — fire the air</l>
     <l n="19">With a reflected radiance , and make turn</l>
     <l n="20">The gazer 's eye away . For me , I lie</l>

     <l n="22">Yet virgin from the kisses of the sun ,</l>
     <l n="23">Retains some freshness , and I woo the wind</l>
     <l n="24">That still delays its coming . Why so slow ,</l>
     <l n="25">Gentle and voluble spirit of the air ?</l>
     <l n="26">Oh , come and breathe upon the fainting earth</l>
     <l n="27">Coolness and life . Is it that in his caves</l>
     <l n="28">He hears me ? See , on yonder woody ridge ,</l>
     <l n="29">The pine is bending his proud top , and now</l>
     <l n="30">Among the nearer groves , chestnut and oak</l>
     <l n="31">Are tossing their green boughs about . He comes !</l>
     <l n="32">Lo , where the grassy meadow runs in waves !</l>
     <l n="33">The deep distressful silence of the scene</l>
     <l n="34">Breaks up with mingling of unnumbered sounds</l>
     <l n="35">And universal motion . He is come ,</l>
     <l n="36">Shaking a shower of blossoms from the shrubs ,</l>
     <l n="37">And bearing on their fragrance ; and he brings</l>
     <l n="38">Music of birds , and rustling of young boughs ,</l>
     <l n="39">And sound of swaying branches , and the voice</l>
     <l n="40">Of distant waterfalls . All the green herbs</l>
     <l n="41">Are stirring in his breath ; a thousand flowers ,</l>
     <l n="42">By the road-side and the borders of the brook ,</l>
     <l n="43">Nod gayly to each other ; glossy leaves</l>
     <l n="44">Are twinkling in the sun , as if the dew</l>
     <l n="45">Were on them yet , and silver waters break</l>
     <l n="46">Into small waves and sparkle as he comes .</l>

     <l n="3">Ascend our rocky mountains . Let thy foot</l>
     <l n="4">Fail not with weariness , for on their tops</l>
     <l n="5">The beauty and the majesty of earth ,</l>
     <l n="6">Spread wide beneath , shall make thee to forget</l>
     <l n="7">The steep and toilsome way . There , as thou stand'st ,</l>
     <l n="8">The haunts of men below thee , and around</l>
     <l n="9">The mountain summits , thy expanding heart</l>
     <l n="10">Shall feel a kindred with that loftier world</l>
     <l n="11">To which thou art translated , and partake</l>
     <l n="12">The enlargement of thy vision . Thou shalt look</l>
     <l n="13">Upon the green and rolling forest tops ,</l>
     <l n="14">And down into the secrets of the glens ,</l>
     <l n="15">And streams , that with their bordering thickets strive</l>
     <l n="16">To hide their windings . Thou shalt gaze , at once ,</l>
     <l n="17">Here on white villages , and tilth , and herds ,</l>
     <l n="18">And swarming roads , and there on solitudes</l>
     <l n="19">That only hear the torrent , and the wind ,</l>
     <l n="20">And eagle 's shriek . There is a precipice</l>
     <l n="21">That seems a fragment of some mighty wall ,</l>
     <l n="22">Built by the hand that fashioned the old world ,</l>
     <l n="23">To separate its nations , and thrown down</l>
     <l n="24">When the flood drowned them . To the north , a path</l>
     <l n="25">Conducts you up the narrow battlement .</l>
     <l n="26">Steep is the western side , shaggy and wild</l>
     <l n="27">With mossy trees , and pinnacles of flint ,</l>
     <l n="28">And many a hanging crag . But , to the east ,</l>
     <l n="29">Sheer to the vale go down the bare old cliffs ,—</l>
     <l n="30">Huge pillars , that in middle heaven upbear</l>
     <l n="31">Their weather-beaten capitals , here dark</l>
     <l n="32">With the thick moss of centuries , and there</l>
     <l n="33">Of chalky whiteness where the thunderbolt</l>
     <l n="34">Has splintered them . It is a fearful thing</l>
     <l n="35">To stand upon the beetling verge , and see</l>
     <l n="36">Where storm and lightning , from that huge gray wall ,</l>
     <l n="37">Have tumbled down vast blocks , and at the base</l>
     <l n="38">Dashed them in fragments , and to lay thine ear</l>
     <l n="39">Over the dizzy depth , and hear the sound</l>
     <l n="40">Of winds , that struggle with the woods below ,</l>
     <l n="41">Come up like ocean murmurs . But the scene</l>
     <l n="42">Is lovely round ; a beautiful river there</l>
     <l n="43">Wanders amid the fresh and fertile meads ,</l>
     <l n="44">The paradise he made unto himself ,</l>
     <l n="45">Mining the soil for ages . On each side</l>
     <l n="46">The fields swell upward to the hills ; beyond ,</l>
     <l n="47">Above the hills , in the blue distance , rise</l>
     <l n="48">The mighty columns with which earth props heaven .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="49">There is a tale about these reverend rocks ,</l>
     <l n="50">A sad tradition of unhappy love ,</l>
     <l n="51">And sorrows borne and ended , long ago ,</l>
     <l n="52">When over these fair vales the savage sought</l>
     <l n="53">His game in the thick woods . There was a maid ,</l>
     <l n="54">The fairest of the Indian maids , bright-eyed ,</l>
     <l n="55">With wealth of raven tresses , a light form ,</l>
     <l n="56">And a gay heart . About her cabin-door</l>
     <l n="57">The wide old woods resounded with her song</l>
     <l n="58">And fairy laughter all the summer day .</l>
     <l n="59">She loved her cousin ; such a love was deemed ,</l>
     <l n="60">By the morality of those stern tribes ,</l>
     <l n="61">Incestuous , and she struggled hard and long</l>
     <l n="62">Against her love , and reasoned with her heart ,</l>
     <l n="63">As simple Indian maiden might . In vain .</l>
     <l n="64">Then her eye lost its lustre , and her step</l>
     <l n="65">Its lightness , and the gray-haired men that passed</l>
     <l n="66">Her dwelling , wondered that they heard no more</l>
     <l n="67">The accustomed song and laugh of her , whose looks</l>
     <l n="68">Were like the cheerful smile of Spring , they said ,</l>
     <l n="69">Upon the Winter of their age . She went</l>
     <l n="70">To weep where no eye saw , and was not found</l>
     <l n="71">When all the merry girls were met to dance ,</l>
     <l n="72">And all the hunters of the tribe were out ;</l>
     <l n="73">Nor when they gathered from the rustling husk</l>
     <l n="74">The shining ear ; nor when , by the river 's side ,</l>
     <l n="75">Thay pulled the grape and startled the wild shades</l>
     <l n="76">With sounds of mirth . The keen-eyed Indian dames</l>
     <l n="77">Would whisper to each other , as they saw</l>
     <l n="78">Her wasting form , and say the girl will die .</l>

     <l n="79">One day into the bosom of a friend ,</l>
     <l n="80">A playmate of her young and innocent years ,</l>
     <l n="81">She poured her griefs . “ Thou know'st , and thou alone , ”</l>
     <l n="82">She said , “ for I have told thee , all my love ,</l>
     <l n="83">And guilt , and sorrow . I am sick of life .</l>
     <l n="84">All night I weep in darkness , and the morn</l>
     <l n="85">Glares on me , as upon a thing accursed ,</l>
     <l n="86">That has no business on the earth . I hate</l>
     <l n="87">The pastimes and the pleasant toils that once</l>
     <l n="88">I loved ; the cheerful voices of my friends</l>
     <l n="89">Have an unnatural horror in mine ear .</l>
     <l n="90">In dreams my mother , from the land of souls ,</l>
     <l n="91">Calls me and chides me . All that look on me</l>
     <l n="92">Do seem to know my shame ; I cannot bear</l>
     <l n="93">Their eyes ; I cannot from my heart root out</l>
     <l n="94">The love that wrings it so , and I must die . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="95">It was a summer morning , and they went</l>
     <l n="96">To this old precipice . About the cliffs</l>
     <l n="97">Lay garlands , ears of maize , and shaggy skins</l>
     <l n="98">Of wolf and bear , the offerings of the tribe</l>
     <l n="99">Here made to the Great Spirit , for they deemed ,</l>
     <l n="100">Like worshippers of the elder time , that God</l>
     <l n="101">Doth walk on the high places and affect</l>
     <l n="102">The earth-o'erlooking mountains . She had on</l>
     <l n="103">The ornaments with which her father loved</l>
     <l n="104">To deck the beauty of his bright-eyed girl ,</l>
     <l n="105">And bade her wear when stranger warriors came</l>
     <l n="106">To be his guests . Here the friends sat them down ,</l>
     <l n="107">And sang , all day , old songs of love and death ,</l>
     <l n="108">And decked the poor wan victim 's hair with flowers ,</l>
     <l n="109">And prayed that safe and swift might be her way</l>
     <l n="110">To the calm world of sunshine , where no grief</l>
     <l n="111">Makes the heart heavy and the eyelids red .</l>
     <l n="112">Beautiful lay the region of her tribe</l>
     <l n="113">Below her — waters resting in the embrace</l>
     <l n="114">Of the wide forest , and maize-planted glades</l>
     <l n="115">Opening amid the leafy wilderness .</l>
     <l n="116">She gazed upon it long , and at the sight</l>
     <l n="117">Of her own village peeping through the trees ,</l>
     <l n="118">And her own dwelling , and the cabin roof</l>
     <l n="119">Of him she loved with an unlawful love ,</l>
     <l n="120">And came to die for , a warm gush of tears</l>
     <l n="121">Ran from her eyes . But when the sun grew low</l>
     <l n="122">And the hill shadows long , she threw herself</l>
     <l n="123">From the steep rock and perished . There was scooped</l>
     <l n="124">Upon the mountain 's southern slope , a grave ;</l>
     <l n="125">And there they laid her , in the very garb</l>
     <l n="126">With which the maiden decked herself for death ,</l>
     <l n="127">With the same withering wild flowers in her hair .</l>
     <l n="128">And o'er the mould that covered her , the tribe</l>
     <l n="129">Built up a simple monument , a cone</l>
     <l n="130">Of small loose stones . Thenceforward all who passed ,</l>
     <l n="131">Hunter , and dame , and virgin , laid a stone</l>
     <l n="132">In silence on the pile . It stands there yet .</l>
     <l n="133">And Indians from the distant West , who come</l>
     <l n="134">To visit where their fathers ’ bones are laid ,</l>
     <l n="135">Yet tell the sorrowful tale , and to this day</l>
     <l n="136">The mountain where the hapless maiden died</l>
     <l n="137">Is called the Mountain of the Monument .</l>

     <l n="1">The groves were God 's first temples . Ere man learned</l>
     <l n="2">To hew the shaft , and lay the architrave ,</l>
     <l n="3">And spread the roof above them ,— ere he framed</l>
     <l n="4">The lofty vault , to gather and roll back</l>
     <l n="5">The sound of anthems ; in the darkling wood ,</l>
     <l n="6">Amidst the cool and silence , he knelt down ,</l>
     <l n="7">And offered to the Mightiest solemn thanks</l>
     <l n="8">And supplication . For his simple heart</l>
     <l n="9">Might not resist the sacred influences</l>
     <l n="10">Which , from the stilly twilight of the place ,</l>
     <l n="11">And from the gray old trunks that high in heaven</l>
     <l n="12">Mingled their mossy boughs , and from the sound</l>
     <l n="13">Of the invisible breath that swayed at once</l>
     <l n="14">All their green tops , stole over him , and bowed</l>
     <l n="15">His spirit with the thought of boundless power</l>
     <l n="16">And inaccessible majesty . Ah , why</l>
     <l n="17">Should we , in the world 's riper years , neglect</l>
     <l n="18">God 's ancient sanctuaries , and adore</l>
     <l n="19">Only among the crowd , and under roofs</l>
     <l n="20">That our frail hands have raised ? Let me , at least ,</l>
     <l n="21">Here , in the shadow of this aged wood ,</l>
     <l n="22">Offer one hymn — thrice happy , if it find</l>
     <l n="23">Acceptance in His ear .</l>

     <l n="27">Upon the naked earth , and , forthwith , rose</l>
     <l n="28">All these fair ranks of trees . They , in thy sun ,</l>
     <l n="29">Budded , and shook their green leaves in thy breeze ,</l>
     <l n="30">And shot towards heaven . The century-living crow ,</l>
     <l n="31">Whose birth was in their tops , grew old and died</l>
     <l n="32">Among their branches , till , at last , they stood ,</l>

     <l n="47">In the tranquillity that thou dost love ,</l>
     <l n="48">Enjoys thy presence . Noiselessly , around ,</l>
     <l n="49">From perch to perch , the solitary bird</l>
     <l n="50">Passes : and yon clear spring , that , midst its herbs ,</l>
     <l n="51">Wells softly forth and visits the strong roots</l>
     <l n="52">Of half the mighty forest , tells no tale</l>
     <l n="53">Of all the good it does . Thou hast not left</l>
     <l n="54">Thyself without a witness , in these shades ,</l>
     <l n="55">Of thy perfections . Grandeur , strength , and grace</l>
     <l n="56">Are here to speak of thee . This mighty oak —</l>
     <l n="57">By whose immovable stem I stand and seem</l>
     <l n="58">Almost annihilated — not a prince ,</l>
     <l n="59">In all that proud old world beyond the deep ,</l>
     <l n="60">Ere wore his crown as loftily as he</l>
     <l n="61">Wears the green coronal of leaves with which</l>
     <l n="62">Thy hand has graced him . Nestled at his root</l>
     <l n="63">Is beauty , such as blooms not in the glare</l>
     <l n="64">Of the broad sun . That delicate forest flower</l>
     <l n="65">With scented breath , and look so like a smile ,</l>
     <l n="66">Seems , as it issues from the shapeless mould ,</l>
     <l n="67">An emanation of the indwelling Life ,</l>
     <l n="68">A visible token of the upholding Love ,</l>

     <l n="43">That overlook the rivers , or that rise</l>
     <l n="44">In the dim forest crowded with old oaks ,</l>
     <l n="45">Answer . A race , that long has passed away ,</l>
     <l n="46">Built them ;— a disciplined and populous race</l>
     <l n="47">Heaped , with long toil , the earth , while yet the Greek</l>
     <l n="48">Was hewing the Pentelicus to forms</l>
     <l n="49">Of symmetry , and rearing on its rock</l>
     <l n="50">The glittering Parthenon . These ample fields</l>
     <l n="51">Nourished their harvests , here their herds were fed ,</l>
     <l n="52">When haply by their stalls the bison lowed ,</l>
     <l n="53">And bowed his maned shoulder to the yoke .</l>
     <l n="54">All day this desert murmured with their toils ,</l>
     <l n="55">Till twilight blushed , and lovers walked , and wooed</l>
     <l n="56">In a forgotten language , and old tunes ,</l>
     <l n="57">From instruments of unremembered form ,</l>
     <l n="58">Gave the soft winds a voice . The red man came —</l>
     <l n="59">The roaming hunter tribes , warlike and fierce ,</l>
     <l n="60">And the mound-builders vanished from the earth .</l>
     <l n="61">The solitude of centuries untold</l>
     <l n="62">Has settled where they dwelt . The prairie-wolf</l>
     <l n="63">Hunts in their meadows , and his fresh-dug den</l>
     <l n="64">Yawns by my path . The gopher mines the ground</l>
     <l n="65">Where stood their swarming cities . All is gone —</l>
     <l n="66">All — save the piles of earth that hold their bones —</l>
     <l n="67">The platforms where they worshipped unknown gods —</l>
     <l n="68">The barriers which they builded from the soil</l>
     <l n="69">To keep the foe at bay — till o'er the walls</l>
     <l n="70">The wild beleaguerers broke , and , one by one ,</l>
     <l n="71">The strongholds of the plain were forced , and heaped</l>
     <l n="72">With corpses . The brown vultures of the wood</l>
     <l n="73">Flocked to those vast uncovered sepulchres ,</l>
     <l n="74">And sat , unscared and silent , at their feast .</l>
     <l n="75">Haply some solitary fugitive ,</l>
     <l n="76">Lurking in marsh and forest , till the sense</l>
     <l n="77">Of desolation and of fear became</l>
     <l n="78">Bitterer than death , yielded himself to die .</l>
     <l n="79">Man 's better nature triumphed then . Kind words</l>
     <l n="80">Welcomed and soothed him ; the rude conquerors</l>
     <l n="81">Seated the captive with their chiefs ; he chose</l>
     <l n="82">A bride among their maidens , and at length</l>
     <l n="83">Seemed to forget ,— yet ne'er forgot ,— the wife</l>
     <l n="84">Of his first love , and her sweet little ones ,</l>
     <l n="85">Butchered , amid their shrieks , with all his race .</l>

     <l n="89">Fills them , or is withdrawn . The red man , too ,</l>
     <l n="90">Has left the blooming wilds he ranged so long ,</l>
     <l n="91">And , nearer to the Rocky Mountains , sought</l>
     <l n="92">A wilder hunting-ground . The beaver builds</l>
     <l n="93">No longer by these streams , but far away ,</l>
     <l n="94">On waters whose blue surface ne'er gave back</l>
     <l n="95">The white man 's face — among Missouri 's springs ,</l>
     <l n="96">And pools whose issues swell the Oregan ,</l>
     <l n="97">He rears his little Venice . In these plains</l>
     <l n="98">The bison feeds no more . Twice twenty leagues</l>
     <l n="99">Beyond remotest smoke of hunter 's camp ,</l>
     <l n="100">Roams the majestic brute , in herds that shake</l>
     <l n="101">The earth with thundering steps — yet here I meet</l>

     <l n="103">Still this great solitude is quick with life .</l>
     <l n="104">Myriads of insects , gaudy as the flowers</l>

     <l n="106">And birds , that scarce have learned the fear of man ,</l>
     <l n="107">Are here , and sliding reptiles of the ground ,</l>
     <l n="108">Startlingly beautiful . The graceful deer</l>
     <l n="109">Bounds to the wood at my approach . The bee ,</l>
     <l n="110">A more adventurous colonist than man ,</l>
     <l n="111">With whom he came across the eastern deep ,</l>
     <l n="112">Fills the savannas with his murmurings ,</l>
     <l n="113">And hides his sweets , as in the golden age ,</l>
     <l n="114">Within the hollow oak . I listen long</l>
     <l n="115">To his domestic hum , and think I hear</l>
     <l n="116">The sound of that advancing multitude</l>
     <l n="117">Which soon shall fill these deserts . From the ground</l>
     <l n="118">Comes up the laugh of children , the soft voice</l>
     <l n="119">Of maidens , and the sweet and solemn hymn</l>
     <l n="120">Of Sabbath worshippers . The low of herds</l>
     <l n="121">Blends with the rustling of the heavy grain</l>
     <l n="122">Over the dark-brown furrows . All at once</l>
     <l n="123">A fresher wind sweeps by , and breaks my dream ,</l>
     <l n="124">And I am in the wilderness alone .</l>

     <l n="6">Has spread its plaited tissues to the sun ;</l>
     <l n="7">Flowers of the garden and the waste have blown</l>
     <l n="8">And withered ; seeds have fallen upon the soil ,</l>

     <l n="6">I , too , amid the overflow of day ,</l>
     <l n="7">Behold the power which wields and cherishes</l>
     <l n="8">The frame of Nature . From this brow of rock</l>
     <l n="9">That overlooks the Hudson 's western marge ,</l>
     <l n="10">I gaze upon the long array of groves ,</l>
     <l n="11">The piles and gulfs of verdure drinking in</l>
     <l n="12">The grateful heats . They love the fiery sun ;</l>
     <l n="13">Their broadening leaves grow glossier , and their sprays</l>
     <l n="14">Climb as he looks upon them . In the midst ,</l>
     <l n="15">The swelling river , into his green gulfs ,</l>
     <l n="16">Unshadowed save by passing sails above ,</l>
     <l n="17">Takes the redundant glory , and enjoys</l>

     <l n="19">That would not open in the early light ,</l>
     <l n="20">Push back their plaited sheaths . The rivulet 's pool ,</l>
     <l n="21">That darkly quivered all the morning long</l>
     <l n="22">In the cool shade , now glimmers in the sun ;</l>

    <p n="1">NOTES .</p>
    <p n="2">POEM OF THE AGES .</p>
    <p n="3">In this poem , written and first printed in the year 1821 , the author has endeavoured , from a survey of the past ages of the world , and of the successive advances of mankind in knowledge , virtue , and happiness , to justify and confirm the hopes of the philanthropist for the future destinies of the human race .</p>
    <p n="4">THE BURIAL-PLACE . ( A Fragment )</p>
    <p n="5">The first half of this fragment may seem to the reader borrowed from the essay on Rural Funerals in the fourth number of the Sketch-Book . The lines were , however , written more than a year before that number appeared . The poem , unfinished as it is , would not have been admitted into this collection , had not the author been unwilling to lose what had the honour of resembling so beautiful a composition .</p>
    <p n="6">THE MASSACRE AT SCIO .</p>
    <p n="7">This poem , written about the time of the horrible butchery of the Sciotes by the Turks , in 1824 , has been more fortunate than most poetical predictions . The independence of the Greek nation , which it foretold , has come to pass , and the massacre , by inspiring a deeper detestation of their oppressors , did much to promote that event .</p>
    <p n="8">THE INDIAN GIRL 'S LAMENT .</p>
    <p n="9">Her maiden veil , her own black hair , &amp; c .</p>
    <p n="10">“ The unmarried females have a modest falling down of the hair over the eyes . ” — ELIOT .</p>
    <p n="11">MONUMENT MOUNTAIN .</p>
    <p n="12">The mountain , called by this name , is a remarkable precipice in Great Barrington , overlooking the rich and picturesque valley of the Housatonic , in the western part of Massachusetts . At the southern extremity is , or was a few years since , a conical pile of small stones , erected , according to the tradition of the surrounding country , by the Indians , in memory of a woman of the Stockbridge tribe , who killed herself by leaping from the edge of the precipice . Until within a few years past , small parties of that tribe used to arrive from their settlement in the western part of the state of New York , on visits to Stockbridge , the place of their nativity and former residence . A young woman belonging to one of these parties related , to a friend of the author , the story on which the poem of Monument Mountain is founded . An Indian girl had formed an attachment for her cousin , which , according to the customs of the tribe , was unlawful . She was , in consequence , seized with a deep melancholy , and resolved to destroy herself . In company with a female friend , she repaired to the mountain , decked out for the occasion in all her ornaments , and , after passing the day on the summit in singing with her companion the traditional songs of her nation , she threw herself headlong from the rock , and was killed .</p>
    <p n="13">THE MURDERED TRAVELLER .</p>
    <p n="14">Some years since , in the month of May , the remains of a human body , partly devoured by wild animals , were found in a woody ravine , near a solitary road passing between the mountains west of the village of Stockbridge . It was supposed that the person came to his death by violence , but no traces could be discovered of his murderers . It was only recollected that one evening , in the course of the previous winter , a traveller had stopped at an inn in the village of West Stockbridge ; that he had inquired the way to Stockbridge ; and that , in paying the innkeeper for something he had ordered , it appeared that he had a considerable sum of money in his possession . Two ill-looking men were present , and went out about the same time that the traveller proceeded on his journey . During the winter , also , two men of shabby appearance , but plentifully supplied with money , had lingered for awhile about the village of Stockbridge . Several years afterward , a criminal , about to be executed for a capital offence in Canada , confessed that he had been concerned in murdering a traveller in Stockbridge for the sake of his money . Nothing was ever discovered respecting the name or residence of the person murdered .</p>
    <p n="15">THE AFRICAN CHIEF .</p>
    <p n="16">Chained in the market place he stood , &amp; c .</p>
    <p n="17">The story of the African Chief , related in this ballad , may be found in the African Repository for April , 1825 . The subject of it was a warrior of majestic stature , the brother of Yarradee , king of the Solima nation . He had been taken in battle , and was brought in chains for sale to the Rio Pongas , where he was exhibited in the market-place , his ankles still adorned with the massy rings of gold which he wore when captured . The refusal of his captor to listen to his offers of ransom drove him mad , and he died a maniac .</p>
    <p n="18">THE CONJUNCTION OF JUPITER AND VENUS .</p>
    <p n="19">This conjunction was said in the common calendars to have taken place on the 2d of August , 1826 . This , I believe , was an error , but the apparent approach of the planets was sufficiently near for poetical purposes .</p>
    <p n="20">THE HURRICANE .</p>
    <p n="21">This poem is nearly a translation from one by José Maria de Heredia , a native of the Island of Cuba , who published at New York , six or seven years since , a volume of poems in the Spanish language .</p>
    <p n="22">SONNET — WILLIAM TELL .</p>
    <p n="23">Neither this , nor any of the other sonnets in the collection , with the exception of the one from the Portuguese , is framed according to the legitimate Italian model , which , in the author 's opinion , possesses no peculiar beauty for an ear accustomed only to the metrical forms of our own language . The sonnets in this collection are rather poems in fourteen lines than sonnets .</p>
    <p n="24">THE HUNTER 'S SERENADE .</p>
    <p n="25">The slim papaya ripens , &amp; c .</p>
    <p n="26">Papaya — papaw , custard-apple . Flint , in his excellent work on the Geography and History of the Western States , thus describes this tree and its fruit :—</p>
    <p n="27">“ A papaw shrub , hanging full of fruits , of a size and weight so disproportioned to the stem , and from under long and rich-looking leaves , of the same yellow with the ripened fruit , and of an African luxuriance of growth , is to us one of the richest spectacles that we have ever contemplated in the array of the woods . The fruit contains from two to six seeds , like those of the tamarind , except that they are double the size . The pulp of the fruit resembles egg-custard in consistence and appearance . It has the same creamy feeling in the mouth , and unites the taste of eggs , cream , sugar , and spice . It is a natural custard , too luscious for the relish of most people . ”</p>
    <p n="28">Chateaubriand , in his Travels , speaks disparagingly of the fruit of the papaw ; but on the authority of Mr. Flint , who must know more of the matter , I have ventured to make my western lover enumerate it among the delicacies of the wilderness .</p>
    <p n="29">THE PRAIRIES .</p>
    <p n="30">The surface rolls and fluctuates to the eye .</p>
    <p n="31">The prairies of the West , with an undulating surface , rolling prairies , as they are called , present to the unaccustomed eye a singular spectacle when the shadows of the clouds are passing rapidly over them . The face of the ground seems to fluctuate and toss like the billows of the sea .</p>
    <p n="32">The prairie-hawk that , poised on high , Flaps his broad wings , yet moves not .</p>
    <p n="33">I have seen the prairie-hawk balancing himself in the air for hours together , apparently over the same spot ; probably watching his prey .</p>
    <p n="34">These ample fields Nourished their harvests .</p>
    <p n="35">The size and extent of the mounds in the valley of the Mississippi , indicate the existence , at a remote period , of a nation at once populous and laborious , and therefore probably subsisting by agriculture .</p>
    <p n="36">The rude conquerors Seated the captive with their chiefs .</p>
    <p n="37">Instances are not wanting of generosity like this among the North American Indians towards a captive or survivor of a hostile tribe on which the greatest cruelties had been exercised .</p>
    <p n="38">SONG OF MARION 'S MEN .</p>
    <p n="39">The exploits of General Francis Marion , the famous partisan warrior of South Carolina , form an interesting chapter in the annals of the American revolution . The British troops were so harassed by the irregular and successful warfare which he kept up at the head of a few daring followers , that they sent an officer to remonstrate with him for not coming into the open field and fighting “ like a gentleman and a Christian . ”</p>
    <p n="40">MARY MAGDALEN .</p>
    <p n="41">Several learned divines , with much appearance of reason , in particular Dr. Lardner , have maintained that the common notion respecting the dissolute life of Mary Magdalen is erroneous , and that she was always a person of excellent character . Charles Taylor , the editor of Calmet 's Dictionary of the Bible , takes the same view of the subject .</p>
    <p n="42">The verses of the Spanish poet here translated refer to the “ woman who had been a sinner , ” mentioned in the seventh chapter of St. Luke 's Gospel , and who is commonly confounded with Mary Magdalen .</p>
    <p n="43">FATIMA AND RADUAN .</p>
    <p n="44">This and the following poems belong to that class of ancient Spanish ballads , by unknown authors , called Romances Moriscos — Moriscan romances or ballads . They were composed in the 14th century , some of them , probably , by the Moors , who then lived intermingled with the Christians ; and they relate the loves and achievements of the knights of Grenada .</p>
    <p n="45">LOVE AND FOLLY .— ( FROM LA FONTAINE . )</p>
    <p n="46">This is rather an imitation than a translation of the poem of the graceful French fabulist .</p>
    <p n="47">THE ALCAYDE OF MOLINA</p>
    <p n="48">These eyes shall not recall thee , &amp; c .</p>
    <p n="49">This is the very expression of the original — No te llamarán mis ojos , &amp; c. The Spanish poets early adopted the practice of calling a lady by the name of the most expressive feature of her countenance , her eyes . The lover styled his mistress “ ojos bellos , ” beautiful eyes ; “ ojos serenos , ” serene eyes . Green eyes seem to have been anciently thought a great beauty in Spain , and there is a very pretty ballad by an absent lover , in which he addressed his lady by the title of “ green eyes ; ” supplicating that he may remain in her remembrance .</p>
    <p n="50">¡ Ay ojuelos verdes ! Ay los mis ojuelos ! Ay , hagan los cielos Que de mi te acuerdes !</p>
    <p n="51">THE DEATH OF ALIATAR .</p>
    <p n="52">Say , Love — for thou didst see her tears , &amp; c .</p>
    <p n="53">The stanza beginning with this line stands thus in the original :—</p>
    <p n="54">Dilo tu , amor , si lo viste ; ¡ Mas ay ! que de lastimado Diste otro nudo á la venda , Para no ver lo que ha pasado .</p>
    <p n="55">I am sorry to find so poor a conceit deforming so spirited a composition as this old ballad , but I have preserved it in the version . It is one of those extravagances which afterward became so common in Spanish poetry , when Gongora introduced the estilo culto , as it was called .</p>
    <p n="56">LOVE IN THE AGE OF CHIVALRY .</p>
    <p n="57">This personification of the passion of Love , by Peyre Vidal , has been referred to as a proof of how little the Provençal poets were indebted to the authors of Greece and Rome for the imagery of their poems .</p>
    <p n="58">THE LOVE OF GOD .— ( FROM THE PROVENÇAL OF BERNARD RASCAS . )</p>
    <p n="59">The original of these lines is thus given by John of Nostradamus , in his lives of the Troubadours , in a barbarous Frenchified orthography :—</p>
    <p n="60">Touta kausa mortala una fes perirá , Fors que l'amour de Dieu , que tousiours durará . Tous nostres cors vendran essuchs , coma fa l'eska , Lous Aubres leyssaran lour verdour tendra e fresca , Lous Auselets del bosc perdran lour kant subtyeu , E non s'auzira plus lou Rossignol gentyeu . Lous Buols al Pastourgage , e las blankas fedettas Sent'ran lous agulhons de las mortals Sagettas , Lous crestas d'Arles fiers , Renards , e Loups espars , Kabrols , Cervys , Chamous , Senglars de toutes pars , Lous Ours hardys e forts , seran poudra , e Arena , Lou Daulphin en la Mar , lou Ton , e la Balena : Monstres impetuous , Ryaumes , e Comtas , Lous Princes , e lous Reys , seran per mort domtas . E nota ben eysso káscun : la Terra granda , ( Ou l'Escritura ment ) lou fermament que branda , Prendra autra figura . Enfin tout perirá , Fors que l'Amour de Dieu , que touiours durará .</p>
    <p n="61">FROM THE SPANISH OF PEDRO DE CASTRO Y AÑAYA .</p>
    <p n="62">Las Auroras de Diana , in which the original of these lines is contained , is , notwithstanding it was praised by Lope de Vega , one of the worst of the old Spanish Romances , being a tissue of riddles and affectations , with now and then a little poem of considerable beauty .</p>
    <p n="63">LIFE .</p>
    <p n="64">Where Isar 's clay-white rivulets run Through the dark wood 's , like frighted deer .</p>
    <p n="65">Close to the city of Munich , in Bavaria , lies the spacious and beautiful pleasure ground , called the English Garden , in which these lines were written , originally projected and laid out by our countryman , Count Rumford , under the auspices of one of the sovereigns of the country . Winding walks of great extent , pass through close thickets and groves interspersed with lawns ; and streams , diverted from the river Isar , traverse the grounds swiftly in various directions , the water of which , stained with the clay of the soil it has corroded in its descent from the upper country , is frequently of a turbid white colour .</p>
    <p n="66">THE GREEN MOUNTAIN BOYS .</p>
    <p n="67">This song refers to the expedition of the Vermonters , commanded by Ethan Allen , by whom the British fort of Ticonderoga , on Lake Champlain , was surprised and taken , in May , 1775 .</p>
    <p n="68">THE CHILD 'S FUNERAL .</p>
    <p n="69">The incident on which this poem is founded was related to the author while in Europe , in a letter from an English lady . A child died in the south of Italy , and when they went to bury it they found it revived and playing with the flowers which , after the manner of that country , had been brought to grace its funeral .</p>
    <p n="70">THE DEATH OF SCHILLER .</p>
    <p n="71">‘ Tis said , when Schiller 's death drew nigh , The wish possessed his mighty mind , To wander forth wherever lie The homes and haunts of human kind .</p>
    <p n="72">Shortly before the death of Schiller , he was seized with a strong desire to travel in foreign countries , as if his spirit had a presentiment of its approaching enlargement , and already longed to expatiate in a wider and more varied sphere of existence .</p>
    <p n="73">THE FOUNTAIN .</p>
    <p n="74">The flower Of Sanguinaria , from whose brittle stem The red drops fell like blood .</p>
    <p n="75">The Sanguinaria Canadensis , or blood-root , as it is commonly called , bears a delicate white flower of a musky scent , the stem of which breaks easily , and distils a juice of a bright red colour .</p>
    <p n="76">THE OLD MAN 'S COUNSEL .</p>
    <p n="77">The shad-bush , white with flowers , Whitened the glens .</p>
    <p n="78">The small tree , named by the botanists Aronia Botyrapium , is called , in some parts of our country , the shad-bush , from the circumstance that it flowers about the time that the shad ascend the rivers in early spring . Its delicate sprays , covered with white blossoms before the trees are yet in leaf , have a singularly beautiful appearance in the woods .</p>
    <p n="79">“ There hast thou , ” said my friend , “ a fitting type Of human life . ”</p>
    <p n="80">I remember hearing an aged man , in the country , compare the slow movement of time in early life and its swift flight as it approaches old age , to the drumming of a partridge or ruffed grouse in the woods — the strokes falling slow and distinct at first , and following each other more and more rapidly , till they end at last in a whirring sound .</p>
    <p n="81">AN EVENING REVERY .— FROM AN UNFINISHED POEM .</p>
    <p n="82">This poem and that entitled the Fountain , with one or two others in blank verse , were intended by the author as portions of a larger poem , in which they may hereafter take their place .</p>
    <p n="83">THE PAINTED CUP .</p>
    <p n="84">The fresh savannas of the Sangamon Here rise in gentle swells , and the long grass Is mixed with rustling hazels . Scarlet tufts Are glowing in the green , like flakes of fire .</p>
    <p n="85">The Painted Cup , Euchroma Coccinea , or Bartsia Coccinea , grows in great abundance in the hazel prairies of the western states , where its scarlet tufts make a brilliant appearance in the midst of the verdure . The Sangamon is a beautiful river , tributary to the Illinois , bordered with rich prairies .</p>
    <p n="86">NOON .</p>
    <p n="87">At noon the Hebrew bowed the knee And worshipped</p>
    <p n="88">Evening and morning , and at noon , will I pray and cry aloud , and he shall hear my voice .— PSALM LV . 17 .</p>
    <p n="89">THE WHITE-FOOTED DEER .</p>
    <p n="90">During the stay of Long 's Expedition at Engineer Cantonment , three specimens of a variety of the common deer were brought in , having all the feet white near the hoofs , and extending to those on the hind feet from a little above the spurious hoofs . This white extremity was divided , upon the sides of the foot , by the general colour of the leg , which extends down near to the hoofs , leaving a white triangle in front , of which the point was elevated rather higher than the spurious hoofs .— GODMAN 'S NATURAL HISTORY , vol . ii . p 314 .</p>
