   <titlePage>
    <docImprint>The “ Lay of the Last Minstrel , ” Scott 's first romantic tale , was published in January ,<date>1805</date>, and won for its author his first great success . The writing of “ Marmion ” was begun in November ,<date>1806</date>. Constable offered as publisher to pay at once a thousand guineas for the copyright , when he heard that the new poem was begun , though he had not yet seen a line of it . Miller and Murray joined , each taking a fourth part of the venture , and John Murray said , “ We both view it as honourable , profitable , and glorious to be concerned in the publication of a new poem by Walter Scott . ” Scott , thirty-five years old , had the impulse upon his mind of a preceding great success , took more than usual pains , and thoroughly enjoyed the writing . On pleasant knolls , under trees , and by the banks of Yarrow , many lines were written ; and trotting quietly over the hills in later life he said to Lockhart , his son-in-law , “ Oh , man , I had many a grand gallop among these bracs when I was thinking of ‘ Marmion . ’ ” The description of the battle of Flodden was shaped in the autumn of<date>1807</date>, when Scott was out practising with the Light Horse Volunteers , which had been formed in prospect of an invasion from<country>France</country>, and of which Scott was quartermaster and secretary . Scott at those gatherings was full of companionable mirth , and in intervals between drill he would sometimes ride his charger at full speed up and down on the sands of Portobello within spray of the wave , while his mind was at work on such lines as -  “ They close , in clouds of smoke and dust , With sword-sway and with lance 's thrust ; And such a yell was there , Of sudden and portentous birth , As if men fought in upper earth , And fiends in upper air . ”</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>“ Marmion ” was published early in the year 1808 ; its first edition of two thousand , in the form , then usual , of a quarto volume , priced at a guinea and a half , was sold in a month . Then came the editions in octavo , of which there were twelve , between 1808 and 1825 . Francis Jeffrey , in the Edinburgh Review , complained of anti - Scottish feeling , and otherwise criticised his friend 's work in a way that alienated Scott , not from Jeffrey , but from the Review , and opened to John Murray a prospect of securing Scott for a contributor to another Review , the Quarterly , which he would found as a representative of other political opinions with which Scott would be more in accord . “ Marmion ” thus has a place in the story of the origin of the Quarterly Review . Of the great popularity of “ Marmion , ” Scott himself said at the time that it gave him “ such a heeze that he had almost lost his footing . ” The Letters introducing the several Books are , in all Scott 's verse , perhaps the poems that most perfectly present to us his own personality . They form no part of “ Marmion , ” in fact there had been a plan for their publication as a distinct book . As they stand they interweave the poet with his poem , making “ Marmion , ” too , a “ Lay of the Last Minstrel , ” in the first days of its publication . George Ellis playfully observed to Scott that “ the personal appearance of the Minstrel who , though the Last , is by far the most charming of all minstrels , is by no means compensated by the idea of an author shorn of his picturesque beard , deprived of his harp , and writing letters to his intimate friends . ” The Minstrel of the Lay was but a creature of imagination ; the Minstrel of “ Marmion ” is Scott himself .

    <head>INTRODUCTION TO CANTO FIRST . TO WILLIAM STEWART ROSE , ESQ .</head>
    <p n="1">Ashestiel , Ettrick Forest .</p>
    <p n="2">November 's sky is chill and drear , November 's leaf is red and sear : Late , gazing down the steepy linn That hems our little garden in , Low in its dark and narrow glen You scarce the rivulet might ken , So thick the tangled greenwood grew , So feeble thrilled the streamlet through : Now , murmuring hoarse , and frequent seen Through bush and briar , no longer green , An angry brook , it sweeps the glade , Brawls over rock and wild cascade , And foaming brown , with doubled speed , Hurries its waters to the Tweed .</p>
    <p n="3">No longer Autumn 's glowing red Upon our forest hills is shed ; No more , beneath the evening beam , Fair Tweed reflects their purple gleam : Away hath passed the heather-bell That bloomed so rich on Needpath Fell ; Sallow his brow , and russet bare Are now the sister-heights of Yair . The sheep , before the pinching heaven , To sheltered dale and down are driven , Where yet some faded herbage pines , And yet a watery sunbeam shines : In meek despondency they eye The withered sward and wintry sky , And far beneath their summer hill , Stray sadly by Glenkinnon 's rill : The shepherd shifts his mantle 's fold , And wraps him closer from the cold ; His dogs no merry circles wheel , But , shivering , follow at his heel ; A cowering glance they often cast , As deeper moans the gathering blast .</p>
    <p n="4">My imps , though hardy , bold , and wild , As best befits the mountain child , Feel the sad influence of the hour , And wail the daisy 's vanished flower ; Their summer gambols tell , and mourn , And anxious ask : “ Will spring return , And birds and lambs again be gay , And blossoms clothe the hawthorn spray ? ”</p>
    <p n="5">Yes , prattlers , yes . The daisy 's flower Again shall paint your summer bower ; Again the hawthorn shall supply The garlands you delight to tie ; The lambs upon the lea shall bound , The wild birds carol to the round , And while you frolic light as they , Too short shall seem the summer day .</p>
    <p n="6">To mute and to material things New life revolving summer brings ; The genial call dead Nature hears , And in her glory reappears . But oh ! my country 's wintry state What second spring shall renovate ? What powerful call shall bid arise The buried warlike and the wise ; The mind that thought for Britain 's weal , The hand that grasped the victor steel ? The vernal sun new life bestows Even on the meanest flower that blows ; But vainly , vainly may he shine , Where glory weeps o'er Nelson 's shrine ; And vainly pierce the solemn gloom , That shrouds , O Pitt , thy hallowed tomb !</p>
    <p n="7">Deep graved in every British heart , Oh never let those names depart ! Say to your sons — Lo , here his grave , Who victor died on Gadite wave ; To him , as to the burning levin , Short , bright , resistless course was given . Where'er his country 's foes were found , Was heard the fated thunder 's sound , Till burst the bolt on yonder shore , Rolled , blazed , destroyed — and was no more .</p>
    <p n="8">Nor mourn ye less his perished worth , Who bade the conqueror go forth , And launched that thunderbolt of war On Egypt , Hafnia , Trafalgar ; Who , born to guide such high emprize , For Britain 's weal was early wise ; Alas ! to whom the Almighty gave , For Britain 's sins , an early grave ! His worth , who , in his mightiest hour , A bauble held the pride of power , Spurned at the sordid lust of pelf , And served his Albion for herself ; Who , when the frantic crowd amain Strained at subjection 's bursting rein , O'er their wild mood full conquest gained , The pride he would not crush restrained , Showed their fierce zeal a worthier cause , And brought the freeman 's arm to aid the freeman 's laws .</p>
    <p n="9">Hadst thou but lived , though stripped of power , A watchman on the lonely tower , Thy thrilling trump had roused the land , When fraud or danger were at hand ; By thee , as by the beacon-light , Our pilots had kept course aright ; As some proud column , though alone , Thy strength had propped the tottering throne : Now is the stately column broke , The beacon-light is quenched in smoke , The trumpet 's silver sound is still , The warder silent on the hill !</p>
    <p n="10">Oh think , how to his latest day , When Death , just hovering , claimed his prey , With Palinure 's unaltered mood , Firm at his dangerous post he stood ; Each call for needful rest repelled , With dying hand the rudder held , Till in his fall , with fateful sway , The steerage of the realm gave way ! Then , while on Britain 's thousand plains One unpolluted church remains , Whose peaceful bells ne'er sent around The bloody tocsin 's maddening sound , But still , upon the hallowed day , Convoke the swains to praise and pray ; While faith and civil peace are dear , Grace this cold marble with a tear -  He who preserved them , Pitt , lies here !</p>
    <p n="11">Nor yet suppress the generous sigh , Because his rival slumbers nigh ; Nor be thy requiescat dumb , Lest it be said o'er Fox 's tomb . For talents mourn , untimely lost When best employed , and wanted most ; Mourn genius high , and lore profound , And wit that loved to play , not wound ; And all the reasoning powers divine , To penetrate , resolve , combine ; And feelings keen , and fancy 's glow -  They sleep with him who sleeps below : And if thou mourn'st they could not save From error him who owns this grave , Be every harsher thought suppressed , And sacred be the last long rest . HERE , where the end of earthly things Lays heroes , patriots , bards , and kings ; Where stiff the hand , and still the tongue , Of those who fought , and spoke , and sung ; HERE , where the fretted aisles prolong The distant notes of holy song , As if some angel spoke again , “ All peace on earth , goodwill to men ; ” If ever from an English heart , Oh , HERE let prejudice depart , And , partial feeling cast aside , Record that Fox a Briton died ! When Europe crouched to France 's yoke , And Austria bent , and Prussia broke , And the firm Russian 's purpose brave Was bartered by a timorous slave , Even then dishonour 's peace he spurned , The sullied olive-branch returned , Stood for his country 's glory fast , And nailed her colours to the mast ! Heaven , to reward his firmness , gave A portion in this honoured grave , And ne'er held marble in its trust Of two such wondrous men the dust .</p>
    <p n="12">With more than mortal powers endowed , How high they soared above the crowd ! Theirs was no common party race , Jostling by dark intrigue for place ; Like fabled gods , their mighty war Shook realms and nations in its jar ; Beneath each banner proud to stand , Looked up the noblest of the land , Till through the British world were known The names of Pitt and Fox alone . Spells of such force no wizard grave E'er framed in dark Thessalian cave , Though his could drain the ocean dry , And force the planets from the sky , These spells are spent , and , spent with these , The wine of life is on the lees . Genius , and taste , and talent gone , For ever tombed beneath the stone , Where — taming thought to human pride ! - The mighty chiefs sleep side by side . Drop upon Fox 's grave the tear , ‘ Twill trickle to his rival 's bier ; O'er Pitt 's the mournful requiem sound , And Fox 's shall the notes rebound . The solemn echo seems to cry -  “ Here let their discord with them die . Speak not for those a separate doom , Whom Fate made brothers in the tomb ; But search the land of living men , Where wilt thou find their like again ? ”</p>
    <p n="13">Rest , ardent spirits ! till the cries Of dying Nature bid you rise ; Not even your Britain 's groans can pierce The leaden silence of your hearse ; Then , oh , how impotent and vain This grateful tributary strain ! Though not unmarked , from northern clime , Ye heard the Border minstrel 's rhyme His Gothic harp has o'er you rung ; The bard you deigned to praise , your deathless names has sung .</p>
    <p n="14">Stay yet , illusion , stay a while , My wildered fancy still beguile ! From this high theme how can I part , Ere half unloaded is my heart ! For all the tears e'er sorrow drew , And all the raptures fancy knew , And all the keener rush of blood , That throbs through bard in bardlike mood , Were here a tribute mean and low , Though all their mingled streams could flow -  Woe , wonder , and sensation high , In one spring-tide of ecstasy ! It will not be — it may not last -  The vision of enchantment 's past : Like frostwork in the morning ray The fancied fabric melts away ; Each Gothic arch , memorial-stone , And long , dim , lofty aisle , are gone ; And lingering last , deception dear , The choir 's high sounds die on my ear . Now slow return the lonely down , The silent pastures bleak and brown , The farm begirt with copsewood wild , The gambols of each frolic child , Mixing their shrill cries with the tone Of Tweed 's dark waters rushing on .</p>
    <p n="15">Prompt on unequal tasks to run , Thus Nature disciplines her son : Meeter , she says , for me to stray , And waste the solitary day , In plucking from yon fen the reed , And watch it floating down the Tweed ; Or idly list the shrilling lay With which the milkmaid cheers her way , Marking its cadence rise and fail , As from the field , beneath her pail , She trips it down the uneven dale : Meeter for me , by yonder cairn , The ancient shepherd 's tale to learn ; Though oft he stop in rustic fear , Lest his old legends tire the ear Of one who , in his simple mind , May boast of book-learned taste refined .</p>
    <p n="16">But thou , my friend , canst fitly tell , ( For few have read romance so well ) How still the legendary lay O'er poet 's bosom holds its sway ; How on the ancient minstrel strain Time lays his palsied hand in vain ; And how our hearts at doughty deeds , By warriors wrought in steely weeds , Still throb for fear and pity 's sake ; As when the Champion of the Lake Enters Morgana 's fated house , Or in the Chapel Perilous , Despising spells and demons ’ force , Holds converse with the unburied corse ; Or when , Dame Ganore 's grace to move , ( Alas , that lawless was their love ! ) He sought proud Tarquin in his den , And freed full sixty knights ; or when , A sinful man , and unconfessed , He took the Sangreal 's holy quest , And , slumbering , saw the vision high , He might not view with waking eye .</p>
    <p n="17">The mightiest chiefs of British song Scorned not such legends to prolong : They gleam through Spenser 's elfin dream , And mix in Milton 's heavenly theme ; And Dryden , in immortal strain , Had raised the Table Round again , But that a ribald king and court Bade him toil on , to make them sport ; Demanded for their niggard pay , Fit for their souls , a looser lay , Licentious satire , song , and play ; The world defrauded of the high design , Profaned the God-given strength , and marred the lofty line .</p>
    <p n="18">Warmed by such names , well may we then , Though dwindled sons of little men , Essay to break a feeble lance In the fair fields of old romance ; Or seek the moated castle 's cell , Where long through talisman and spell , While tyrants ruled , and damsels wept , Thy Genius , Chivalry , hath slept : There sound the harpings of the North , Till he awake and sally forth , On venturous quest to prick again , In all his arms , with all his train , Shield , lance , and brand , and plume , and scarf , Fay , giant , dragon , squire , and dwarf , And wizard with his want of might , And errant maid on palfrey white . Around the Genius weave their spells , Pure Love , who scarce his passion tells ; Mystery , half veiled and half revealed ; And Honour , with his spotless shield ; Attention , with fixed eye ; and Fear , That loves the tale she shrinks to hear ; And gentle Courtesy ; and Faith , Unchanged by sufferings , time , or death ; And Valour , lion-mettled lord , Leaning upon his own good sword .</p>
    <p n="19">Well has thy fair achievement shown A worthy meed may thus be won ; Ytene 's oaks — beneath whose shade Their theme the merry minstrels made , Of Ascapart , and Bevis bold , And that Red King , who , while of old , Through Boldrewood the chase he led , By his loved huntsman 's arrow bled -  Ytene 's oaks have heard again Renewed such legendary strain ; For thou hast sung how he of Gaul , That Amadis so famed in hall , For Oriana foiled in fight The necromancer 's felon might ; And well in modern verse hast wove Partenopex 's mystic love : Hear , then , attentive to my lay , A knightly tale of Albion 's elder day .</p>

     <l n="1">Day set on Norham 's castled steep ,</l>
     <l n="2">And Tweed 's fair river , broad and deep ,</l>
     <l n="3">And Cheviot 's mountains lone ;</l>
     <l n="4">The battled towers , the donjon keep ,</l>
     <l n="5">The loophole grates where captives weep ,</l>
     <l n="6">The flanking walls that round it sweep ,</l>
     <l n="7">In yellow lustre shone .</l>
     <l n="8">The warriors on the turrets high ,</l>
     <l n="9">Moving athwart the evening sky ,</l>
     <l n="10">Seemed forms of giant height :</l>
     <l n="11">Their armour , as it caught the rays ,</l>
     <l n="12">Flashed back again the western blaze ,</l>
     <l n="13">In lines of dazzling light .</l>

     <head>II .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="2">
      <l n="14">Saint George 's banner , broad and gay ,</l>
      <l n="15">Now faded , as the fading ray</l>
      <l n="16">Less bright , and less , was flung ;</l>
      <l n="17">The evening gale had scarce the power</l>
      <l n="18">To wave it on the donjon tower ,</l>
      <l n="19">So heavily it hung .</l>
      <l n="20">The scouts had parted on their search ,</l>
      <l n="21">The castle gates were barred ;</l>
      <l n="22">Above the gloomy portal arch ,</l>
      <l n="23">Timing his footsteps to a march ,</l>
      <l n="24">The warder kept his guard ;</l>
      <l n="25">Low humming , as he paced along ,</l>
      <l n="26">Some ancient Border gathering song .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="3">
      <l n="27">A distant trampling sound he hears ;</l>
      <l n="28">He looks abroad , and soon appears</l>
      <l n="29">O'er Horncliff Hill a plump of spears ,</l>
      <l n="30">Beneath a pennon gay ;</l>
      <l n="31">A horseman , darting from the crowd ,</l>
      <l n="32">Like lightning from a summer cloud ,</l>
      <l n="33">Spurs on his mettled courser proud ,</l>
      <l n="34">Before the dark array .</l>
      <l n="35">Beneath the sable palisade</l>
      <l n="36">That closed the castle barricade ,</l>
      <l n="37">His bugle-horn he blew ;</l>
      <l n="38">The warder hasted from the wall ,</l>
      <l n="39">And warned the captain in the hall ,</l>
      <l n="40">For well the blast he knew ;</l>
      <l n="41">And joyfully that knight did call ,</l>
      <l n="42">To sewer , squire , and seneschal .</l>

      <l n="60">His helm hung at the saddlebow ;</l>
      <l n="61">Well by his visage you might know</l>

      <l n="64">The scar on his brown cheek revealed</l>
      <l n="65">A token true of Bosworth field ;</l>
      <l n="66">His eyebrow dark , and eye of fire ,</l>
      <l n="67">Showed spirit proud and prompt to ire ;</l>
      <l n="68">Yet lines of thought upon his cheek</l>
      <l n="69">Did deep design and counsel speak .</l>
      <l n="70">His forehead , by his casque worn bare ,</l>
      <l n="71">His thick moustache , and curly hair ,</l>
      <l n="72">Coal-black , and grizzled here and there ,</l>

      <l n="74">His square-turned joints , and strength of limb ,</l>
      <l n="75">Showed him no carpet knight so trim ,</l>
      <l n="76">But in close fight a champion grim ,</l>
      <l n="77">In camps a leader sage .</l>

      <l n="81">Was all with burnished gold embossed ;</l>
      <l n="82">Amid the plumage of the crest ,</l>
      <l n="83">A falcon hovered on her nest ,</l>

     <l n="57">When the tired ploughman , dry and warm ,</l>
     <l n="58">Hears , half-asleep , the rising storm</l>
     <l n="59">Hurling the hail , and sleeted rain ,</l>

     <l n="61">The sounds that drive wild deer , and fox ,</l>

     <l n="64">To dismal and to dangerous task .</l>
     <l n="65">Oft he looks forth , and hopes , in vain ,</l>

     <l n="72">Whistling and cheering them to aid ,</l>
     <l n="73">Around his back he wreathes the plaid :</l>
     <l n="74">His flock he gathers , and he guides ,</l>
     <l n="75">To open downs , and mountain-sides ,</l>
     <l n="76">Where , fiercest though the tempest blow ,</l>

     <l n="82">Loses its feeble gleam ,— and then</l>
     <l n="83">Turns patient to the blast again ,</l>

     <l n="99">His healthy fare , his rural cot ,</l>
     <l n="100">His summer couch by greenwood tree ,</l>
     <l n="101">His rustic kirn 's loud revelry ,</l>

     <l n="1">Heap on more wood ! the wind is chill ;</l>
     <l n="2">But let it whistle as it will ,</l>
     <l n="3">We 'll keep our Christmas merry still .</l>
     <l n="4">Each age has deemed the new-born year</l>
     <l n="5">The fittest time for festal cheer ;</l>
     <l n="6">E'en , heathen yet , the savage Dane</l>
     <l n="7">At Iol more deep the mead did drain ;</l>
     <l n="8">High on the beach his galleys drew ,</l>
     <l n="9">And feasted all his pirate crew ;</l>
     <l n="10">Then in his low and pine-built hall ,</l>
     <l n="11">Where shields and axes decked the wall ,</l>
     <l n="12">They gorged upon the half-dressed steer ;</l>
     <l n="13">Caroused in seas of sable beer ;</l>
     <l n="14">While round , in brutal jest , were thrown</l>
     <l n="15">The half-gnawed rib and marrow-bone ;</l>
     <l n="16">Or listened all , in grim delight ,</l>
     <l n="17">While scalds yelled out the joys of fight .</l>
     <l n="18">Then forth , in frenzy , would they hie ,</l>
     <l n="19">While wildly-loose their red locks fly ,</l>
     <l n="20">And dancing round the blazing pile ,</l>
     <l n="21">They make such barbarous mirth the while ,</l>
     <l n="22">As best might to the mind recall</l>
     <l n="23">The boist'rous joys of Odin 's hall .</l>
     <l n="24">And well our Christian sires of old</l>
     <l n="25">Loved , when the year its course had rolled ,</l>
     <l n="26">And brought blithe Christmas back again ,</l>
     <l n="27">With all his hospitable train .</l>
     <l n="28">Domestic and religious rite</l>
     <l n="29">Gave honour to the holy night ;</l>
     <l n="30">On Christmas Eve the bells were rung ;</l>
     <l n="31">On Christmas Eve the mass was sung ;</l>
     <l n="32">That only night in all the year</l>
     <l n="33">Saw the stoled priest the chalice rear .</l>
     <l n="34">The damsel donned her kirtle sheen ;</l>
     <l n="35">The hall was dressed with holly green ;</l>
     <l n="36">Forth to the wood did merry men go ,</l>
     <l n="37">To gather in the mistletoe .</l>
     <l n="38">Then opened wide the baron 's hall</l>
     <l n="39">To vassal , tenant , serf , and all ;</l>
     <l n="40">Power laid his rod of rule aside ,</l>
     <l n="41">And Ceremony doffed his pride .</l>
     <l n="42">The heir , with roses in his shoes ,</l>
     <l n="43">That night might village partner choose ;</l>
     <l n="44">The lord , underogating , share</l>
     <l n="45">The vulgar game of “ post and pair . ”</l>
     <l n="46">All hailed , with uncontrolled delight ,</l>
     <l n="47">And general voice , the happy night ,</l>
     <l n="48">That to the cottage , as the crown ,</l>
     <l n="49">Brought tidings of salvation down .</l>
     <l n="50">The fire , with well-dried logs supplied ,</l>
     <l n="51">Went roaring up the chimney wide ;</l>
     <l n="52">The huge hall table 's oaken face ,</l>
     <l n="53">Scrubbed till it shone , the day to grace ,</l>
     <l n="54">Bore then upon its massive board</l>
     <l n="55">No mark to part the squire and lord .</l>
     <l n="56">Then was brought in the lusty brawn ,</l>
     <l n="57">By old blue-coated serving-man ;</l>
     <l n="58">Then the grim boar 's head frowned on high ,</l>
     <l n="59">Crested with bays and rosemary .</l>
     <l n="60">Well can the green-garbed ranger tell ,</l>
     <l n="61">How , when , and where , the monster fell :</l>
     <l n="62">What dogs before his death he tore ,</l>
     <l n="63">And all the baiting of the boar .</l>
     <l n="64">The wassail round , in good brown bowls ,</l>
     <l n="65">Garnished with ribbons , blithely trowls .</l>
     <l n="66">There the huge sirloin reeked ; hard by</l>
     <l n="67">Plum-porridge stood , and Christmas pie ;</l>
     <l n="68">Nor failed old Scotland to produce ,</l>
     <l n="69">At such high tide , her savoury goose .</l>
     <l n="70">Then came the merry maskers in ,</l>
     <l n="71">And carols roared with blithesome din ;</l>
     <l n="72">If unmelodious was the song ,</l>
     <l n="73">It was a hearty note , and strong .</l>
     <l n="74">Who lists may in their mumming see</l>
     <l n="75">Traces of ancient mystery ;</l>
     <l n="76">White shirts supplied the masquerade ,</l>
     <l n="77">And smutted cheeks the visors made ;</l>
     <l n="78">But oh ! what maskers richly dight</l>
     <l n="79">Can boast of bosoms half so light !</l>
     <l n="80">England was merry England , when</l>
     <l n="81">Old Christmas brought his sports again .</l>
     <l n="82">‘ Twas Christmas broached the mightiest ale ;</l>
     <l n="83">‘ Twas Christmas told the merriest tale :</l>
     <l n="84">A Christmas gambol oft could cheer</l>
     <l n="85">The poor man 's heart through half the year .</l>
     <l n="86">Still linger , in our Northern clime ,</l>
     <l n="87">Some remnants of the good old time ;</l>
     <l n="88">And still , within our valleys here ,</l>
     <l n="89">We hold the kindred title dear ,</l>
     <l n="90">Even when , perchance , its far-fetched claim</l>
     <l n="91">To Southern ear sounds empty name ;</l>
     <l n="92">For course of blood , our proverbs deem ,</l>
     <l n="93">Is warmer than the mountain-stream .</l>
     <l n="94">And thus my Christmas still I hold</l>
     <l n="95">Where my great grandsire came of old ,</l>
     <l n="96">With amber beard , and flaxen hair ,</l>
     <l n="97">And reverend apostolic air -</l>
     <l n="98">The feast and holy-tide to share ,</l>
     <l n="99">And mix sobriety with wine ,</l>
     <l n="100">And honest mirth with thoughts divine :</l>
     <l n="101">Small thought was his in after time</l>
     <l n="102">E'er to be hitched into a rhyme .</l>
     <l n="103">The simple sire could only boast ,</l>
     <l n="104">That he was loyal to his cost ;</l>
     <l n="105">The banished race of kings revered ,</l>
     <l n="106">And lost his land — but kept his beard .</l>
     <l n="107">In these dear halls , where welcome kind</l>
     <l n="108">Is with fair liberty combined ;</l>
     <l n="109">Where cordial friendship gives the hand ,</l>
     <l n="110">And flies constraint the magic wand</l>
     <l n="111">Of the fair dame that rules the land .</l>
     <l n="112">Little we heed the tempest drear ,</l>
     <l n="113">While music , mirth , and social cheer ,</l>
     <l n="114">Speed on their wings the passing year .</l>
     <l n="115">And Mertoun 's halls are fair e'en now ,</l>
     <l n="116">When not a leaf is on the bough .</l>
     <l n="117">Tweed loves them well , and turns again ,</l>
     <l n="118">As loth to leave the sweet domain ,</l>
     <l n="119">And holds his mirror to her face ,</l>
     <l n="120">And clips her with a close embrace :</l>
     <l n="121">Gladly as he , we seek the dome ,</l>
     <l n="122">And as reluctant turn us home .</l>
     <l n="123">How just that , at this time of glee ,</l>
     <l n="124">My thoughts should , Heber , turn to thee !</l>
     <l n="125">For many a merry hour we 've known ,</l>
     <l n="126">And heard the chimes of midnight 's tone .</l>
     <l n="127">Cease , then , my friend ! a moment cease ,</l>
     <l n="128">And leave these classic tomes in peace !</l>
     <l n="129">Of Roman and of Grecian lore</l>
     <l n="130">Sure mortal brain can hold no more .</l>
     <l n="131">These ancients , as Noll Bluff might say ,</l>
     <l n="132">“ Were pretty fellows in their day ; ”</l>
     <l n="133">But time and tide o'er all prevail -</l>
     <l n="134">On Christmas eve a Christmas tale ,</l>
     <l n="135">Of wonder and of war — “ Profane !</l>
     <l n="136">What ! leave the loftier Latian strain ,</l>
     <l n="137">Her stately prose , her verse 's charms ,</l>
     <l n="138">To hear the clash of rusty arms :</l>
     <l n="139">In Fairy Land or Limbo lost ,</l>
     <l n="140">To jostle conjuror and ghost ,</l>
     <l n="141">Goblin and witch ! ” Nay , Heber dear ,</l>
     <l n="142">Before you touch my charter , hear ;</l>
     <l n="143">Though Leyden aids , alas ! no more ,</l>
     <l n="144">My cause with many-languaged lore ,</l>
     <l n="145">This may I say : -  in realms of death</l>
     <l n="146">Ulysses meets Alcides ’ WRAITH ;</l>
     <l n="147">AEneas , upon Thracia 's shore ,</l>

     <l n="149">For omens , we in Livy cross ,</l>
     <l n="150">At every turn , locutus Bos .</l>
     <l n="151">As grave and duly speaks that ox ,</l>
     <l n="152">As if he told the price of stocks</l>
     <l n="153">Or held in Rome republican ,</l>
     <l n="154">The place of common-councilman .</l>
     <l n="155">All nations have their omens drear ,</l>
     <l n="156">Their legends wild of woe and fear .</l>
     <l n="157">To Cambria look — the peasant see</l>

     <l n="159">And shun “ the spirit 's blasted tree . ”</l>

     <l n="167">He walks among the sons of men .</l>
     <l n="168">Did'st e'er , dear Heber , pass along</l>
     <l n="169">Beneath the towers of Franchemont ,</l>
     <l n="170">Which , like an eagle 's nest in air ,</l>
     <l n="171">Hang o'er the stream and hamlet fair ;</l>
     <l n="172">Deep in their vaults , the peasants say ,</l>
     <l n="173">A mighty treasure buried lay ,</l>
     <l n="174">Amassed through rapine and through wrong ,</l>
     <l n="175">By the last Lord of Franchemont .</l>
     <l n="176">The iron chest is bolted hard ,</l>
     <l n="177">A huntsman sits , its constant guard ;</l>

     <l n="183">As true a huntsman doth he look ,</l>
     <l n="184">As bugle e'er in brake did sound ,</l>
     <l n="185">Or ever hallooed to a hound .</l>
     <l n="186">To chase the fiend , and win the prize ,</l>
     <l n="187">In that same dungeon ever tries</l>

     <l n="192">And oft the conjuror 's words will make</l>
     <l n="193">The stubborn demon groan and quake ;</l>
     <l n="194">And oft the bands of iron break ,</l>
     <l n="195">Or bursts one lock , that still amain ,</l>
     <l n="196">Fast as ‘ tis opened , shuts again .</l>
     <l n="197">That magic strife within the tomb</l>
     <l n="198">May last until the day of doom ,</l>
     <l n="199">Unless the adept shall learn to tell</l>
     <l n="200">The very word that clenched the spell ,</l>

     <l n="202">A hundred years are past and gone ,</l>

     <l n="204">Such general superstition may</l>

Far on the left , unseen the while , Stanley broke Lennox and Argyle ; Though there the western mountaineer Rushed with bare bosom on the spear , And flung the feeble targe aside , And with both hands the broadsword plied , ‘ Twas vain : -  But Fortune , on the right , With fickle smile , cheered Scotland 's fight . Then fell that spotless banner white , The Howard 's lion fell ; Yet still Lord Marmion 's falcon flew With wavering flight , while fiercer grew Around the battle-yell . The Border slogan rent the sky ! A Home ! a Gordon ! was the cry : Loud were the clanging blows ; Advanced — forced back — now low , now high , The pennon sunk and rose ; As bends the barque 's mast in the gale , When rent are rigging , shrouds , and sail , It wavered ‘ mid the foes . No longer Blount the view could bear : “ By heaven and all its saints ! I swear , I will not see it lost ; Fitz-Eustace , you with Lady Clare May bid your beads , and patter prayer -  I gallop to the host . ” And to the fray he rode amain , Followed by all the archer train . The fiery youth , with desperate charge , Made , for a space , an opening large -  The rescued banner rose -  But darkly closed the war around , Like pine-trees , rooted from the ground , It sunk among the foes . Then Eustace mounted too : -  yet stayed , As loth to leave the helpless maid , When , fast as shaft can fly , Bloodshot his eyes , his nostrils spread , The loose rein dangling from his head , Housing and saddle bloody red , Lord Marmion 's steed rushed by ; And Eustace , maddening at the sight , A look and sign to Clara cast , To mark he would return in haste , Then plunged into the fight .</p>

   <p>With fruitless labour , Clara bound , And strove to staunch the gushing wound : The monk with unavailing cares , Exhausted all the Church 's prayers . Ever , he said , that , close and near , A lady 's voice was in his ear , And that the priest he could not hear ; For that she ever sung , “ IN THE LOST BATTLE , BORNE DOWN BY THE FLYING WHERE MINGLES WAR 'S RATTLE WITH GROANS OF THE DYING ! ” So the notes rung ; -  “ Avoid thee , Fiend !— with cruel hand , Shake not the dying sinner 's sand ! Oh , look , my son , upon yon sign Of the Redeemer 's grace divine ! Oh , think on faith and bliss ! By many a death-bed I have been , And many a sinner 's parting seen , But never aught like this . ” The war , that for a space did fail , Now trebly thundering swelled the gale And — “ Stanley ! ” was the cry ; A light on Marmion 's visage spread , And fired his glazing eye : With dying hand , above his head , He shook the fragment of his blade , And shouted “ Victory ! Charge , Chester , charge ! On , Stanley , on ! ” Were the last words of Marmion .</p>
