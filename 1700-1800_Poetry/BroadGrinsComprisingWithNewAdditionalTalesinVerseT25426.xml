    <docImprint><settlement>LONDON</settlement>: H. G. BOHN , YORK STREET , COVENT GARDEN . MDCCCXXXIX . ADVERTISEMENT . MY Booksellers inform 'd me , lately , that several inquiries had been made for My Night-Gown and Slippers ,— but that every copy had been sold ;— they had been out of print these two years .— “ Then publish them again , ” said I , boldly ,— ( I print at my own risk ) — and with an air of triumph . Messrs. Cadell and Davies advise 'd me to make additions .— “ The Work is , really , too short , ” said Messrs. Cadell and Davies ,— “ I wish , gentlemen , ” return 'd I , “ my readers were of your opinion . ” — “ I protest , Sir , ” said they , ( and they asserted it , both together , with great emphasis ,) “ you have but Three Tales . ” — I told them , carelessly , it was enough for the greatest Bashaw , among modern poets , and wish 'd them a good morning . When a man , as Sterne observes , “ can extricate himself with an equivoque , in such an unequal match , ” — ( and two booksellers to one poet are tremendous odds ) — “ he is not ill off ; ” — but reflecting a little , as I went home , I began to think my pun was a vile one ,— and did not assist me , one jot , in my argument ;— and , now I have put it upon paper , it appears viler still ;— it is execrable .— So , without much further reasoning , I sat down to rhyming ;— rhyming , as the reader will see , in open defiance of all reason ,— except the reasons of Messrs. Cadell and Davies .— Thus you have My Night-Gown and Slippers , with Additions , converted to Broad Grins ;— and ‘ tis well if they may not end in Wide Yawns at last ! Should this be the case , gentle Reviewers , do not , ungratefully , attempt to break my sleep , ( you will find it labour lost ) because I have contributed to your 's .</docImprint>

       <l n="15">Shove on this maiden 's Will relied securely ;</l>

       <l n="19">He had Apartments up two pair of stairs ;</l>

       <l n="25">Now , you must know ,</l>
       <l n="26">This Doctor Crow</l>
       <l n="27">Was not of Law , nor Music , nor Divinity ;—</l>
       <l n="28">He was obstetrick ;— but , the fact is ,</l>
       <l n="29">He did n't in Lucina 's turnpike practise ;</l>
       <l n="30">He took bye-roads ,— reducing Ladies ’ shapes ,</l>
       <l n="31">Who had secure 'd themselves from leading apes ,</l>
       <l n="32">But kept the reputation of virginity .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="33">Crow had a roomy tenement of brick ,</l>
       <l n="34">Enclose 'd with walls , one mile from Hyde Park corner ;</l>
       <l n="35">Fir trees , and yews , were planted round it , thick ;—</l>
       <l n="36">No situation was forlorner !<span type="note_anchor">[ 15 ]</span></l>
       <l n="37">Yet , notwithstanding folks might scout it ,</l>
       <l n="38">It suited qualmish Spinsters , who fell sick ,</l>
       <l n="39">And did n't wish the world to know about it .</l>

       <l n="5">Too weighty to be settle 'd by Attorney ! ” —</l>

       <l n="12">To those who dabble in their neighbours ’ matters ;</l>
       <l n="13">Therefore , he wisely held it good</l>
       <l n="14">To hide his practice from the neighbourhood ,</l>
       <l n="15">And not appear , there , as a resident ;</l>
       <l n="16">But merely one who , casually , went</l>

       <l n="18">To lounge , and chat , not minding time a souse ;—</l>
       <l n="19">Like one to whom all business was quite foreign ;—</l>

       <l n="34">To buy , at his own cost , a street-door bell ,</l>

     <p>says Æneas , by way of proem ; yet , for a Hero , tolerably “ use 'd to the melting mood , ” he talks , on this occasion , much more than he cries ; and , though he begins with a wooden Horse , and gives a general account of the burning of Troy , still the “ quorum pars magna fui ” is , evidently , the great inducement to his chattering :— accordingly , he keeps up Queen Dido to a scandalous late hour , after supper , for the good folks of Carthage , to tell her an egotistical story , that occupies two whole books of the Æneid .— Oh , these Heroes !— I once knew a worthy General — but I wont tell that story .</p>
     <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>Far be it from me to offer a pedantick affront to the Gentlemen who peruse me , by explaining the word Incubus ; which Pliny and others , more learnedly , call Ephialtes .— I , modestly , state it to mean the Night-Mare , for the information of the Ladies . The chief symptom by which this affliction is vulgarly known , is a heavy pressure upon the stomach , when lying in a supine posture in bed . It would terrify some of my fair readers , who never experience 'd this characteristick of the Incubus , were I to dwell on its effects ; and it would irritate others , who are in the habit of labouring under its sensations .</p>
     <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>An old Gentlewoman , a great admirer of the BLACK LETTER , ( as many old Gentlewomen are ) presented the Author of these Tales with the Original MS. of this Sonnet ; advising the publication of a facsimile of the Knight 's hand-writing . It is painful , after this , to advance , that the Sonnet , so far from being genuine , is one of the clumsiest literary forgeries , that the present times have witnessed . It appears , in this authentick Story , that Sir Thomas Erpingham was married in the reign of Henry the Fifth ; and it is evidently intended , that Moderns should believe he writ these love-verses almost immediately after his marriage ; not only from the ardour with which he celebrates the beauty of his wife , but from the circumstance of a man writing any love-verses upon his wife at all ;— but the style and language of the lines are most glaringly inconsistent with their pretended date . The fact is , we have here foisted upon us a close imitation of COWLEY , ( vide the MISTRESS ) who was not born till the year 1618 ,— two centuries after the era in question . Chaucer died , A. D. 1400 ; and Henry the Fifth ( who was king only 9 years , 5 months , and 11 days ) began his reign scarcely 13 years after the death of that Poet . Sir Thomas , then , must , at least , have written in the obsolete phraseology of Chaucer ,— and , probably , would have imitated him ,— as did Lidgate , Occleve , and others ;— nay , Harding , Skelton , &amp; c. who were fifty or sixty years subsequent to Chaucer , were not so modern in their language as their celebrated predecessor . Having , in few words , prove 'd ( it is presume 'd ) this Sonnet to be spurious , an apology may be thought necessary for not saying a great deal more ;— but this Herculean task is left , in deference , to the disputants on Vortigern ; who will , doubtless , engage in it , as a matter of great importance , and , once more , lay the world under very heavy obligations , with various Pamphlets in folio , upon the subject :— and , surely , too many acknowledgments cannot be given to men who are so indefatigably generous in their researches , that half the result of them , when publish 'd , causes even the sympathetick reader to labour as much as the Writer !</p>

     <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>If the Knight knew the aptness , in its full extent , of his oath , upon this occasion , we must give him more credit for his reading than we are willing to allow to military men of the age in which he flourish 'd ;— for , observe : he vows to cudgel a man lurking to rob his Lady of her virtue , in a bower ;— how appropriately , therefore , does he swear by the God of the Gardens ! who is represented with a kind of cudgel ( falx lignea ) in his right hand ; and is , moreover , furnished with another weapon of formidable dimensions , ( Horace calls it Palus ) for the express purpose of annoying Robbers .</p>

     <p>It must be confess 'd that the last mention 'd attribute of this Deity was stretch 'd forth to promote pleasure in some instances , instead of fear ;— for it was a sportive custom , in the hilarity of recent marriages , to seat the Bride upon his Palus ;— but this circumstance by no means disproves its efficacy as a dread to Robbers ; on the contrary , that implement must have been peculiarly terrifick , which could sustain the weight of so many Brides , without detriment to its firmness , or elasticity .</p>
     <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>There is a terrible jumble in Somnus 's family . He was the son of Nox , by Erebus ;— and Erebus , according to different accounts , was not only Nox 's husband , but her brother ,— and even her son , by Chaos ;— and Mors was daughter of Somnus , by that devil of a Goddess Nox , the mother of his father and himself !— The heathen Deities held our canonical notions in utter contempt ; and must have laugh 'd at the idea ( which , surely , nobody does now ,) of forbidding a man to marry his Grandmother .</p>
