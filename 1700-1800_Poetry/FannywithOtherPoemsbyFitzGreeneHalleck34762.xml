    <list type="contents">
     <item>I. Fanny was younger once than she is now , And prettier of course : I do not mean To say that there are wrinkles on her brow ; Yet , to be candid , she is past eighteen — Perhaps past twenty — but the girl is shy About her age , and Heaven forbid that I</item>
     <item>II . Should get myself in trouble by revealing A secret of this sort ; I have too long Loved pretty women with a poet 's feeling , And when a boy , in day dream and in song , Have knelt me down and worshipp 'd them : alas ! They never thank 'd me for't — but let that pass .</item>
     <item>III . I 've felt full many a heart-ache in my day , At the mere rustling of a muslin gown , And caught some dreadful colds , I blush to say , While shivering in the shade of beauty 's frown . They say her smiles are sunbeams — it may be — But never a sunbeam would she throw on me .</item>
     <item>IV . But Fanny 's is an eye that you may gaze on For half an hour , without the slightest harm ; E'en when she wore her smiling summer face on There was but little danger , and the charm That youth and wealth once gave , has bade farewell . Hers is a sad , sad tale — ‘ tis mine its woes to tell .</item>
     <item>V. Her father kept , some fifteen years ago , A retail dry-good shop in Chatham-street , And nursed his little earnings , sure though slow , Till , having muster 'd wherewithal to meet The gaze of the great world , he breathed the air Of Pearl-street — and “ set up ” in Hanover-square .</item>
     <item>VI . Money is power , ‘ tis said — I never tried ; I 'm but a poet — and bank-notes to me Are curiosities , as closely eyed , Whene'er I get them , as a stone would be , Toss 'd from the moon on Doctor Mitchill 's table , Or classic brickbat from the tower of Babel .</item>
     <item>VII . But he I sing of well has known and felt That money hath a power and a dominion ; For when in Chatham-street the good man dwelt , No one would give a sous for his opinion . And though his neighbours were extremely civil , Yet , on the whole , they thought him — a poor devil ,</item>
     <item>VIII . A decent kind of person ; one whose head Was not of brains particularly full ; It was not known that he had ever said Any thing worth repeating — ‘ twas a dull , Good , honest man — what Paulding 's muse would call A “ cabbage head ” — but he excelled them all</item>
     <item>IX . In that most noble of the sciences , The art of making money ; and he found The zeal for quizzing him grew less and less , As he grew richer ; till upon the ground Of Pearl-street , treading proudly in the might And majesty of wealth , a sudden light</item>
     <item>X . Flash 'd like the midnight lightning on the eyes Of all who knew him ; brilliant traits of mind , And genius , clear and countless as the dies Upon the peacock 's plumage ; taste refined , Wisdom and wit , were his — perhaps much more . ‘ Twas strange they had not found it out before .</item>
     <item>XI . In this quick transformation , it is true That cash had no small share ; but there were still Some other causes , which then gave a new Impulse to head and heart , and join 'd to fill His brain with knowledge ; for there first he met The editor of the New-York Gazette ,</item>
     <item>XII . The sapient Mr. L ** G. The world of him Knows much , yet not one half so much as he Knows of the world . Up to its very brim The goblet of his mind is sparkling free With lore and learning . Had proud Sheba 's queen , In all her bloom and beauty , but have seen</item>
     <item>XIII . This modern Solomon , the Israelite , Earth 's monarch as he was , had never won her . He would have hang 'd himself for very spite , And she , bless 'd woman , might have had the honour Of some neat “ paragraphs ” — worth all the lays That Judah 's minstrel warbled in her praise .</item>
     <item>XIV . Her star arose too soon ; but that which sway 'd Th ’ ascendant at our merchant 's natal hour Was bright with better destiny — its aid Led him to pluck within the classic bower Of bulletins , the blossoms of true knowledge ; And L ** G supplied the loss of school and college .</item>
     <item>XV . For there he learn 'd the news some minutes sooner Than others could ; and to distinguish well The different signals , whether ship or schooner , Hoisted at Staten Island ; and to tell The change of wind , and of his neighbour 's fortunes , And , best of all — he there learn 'd self-importance .</item>
     <item>XVI . Nor were these all the advantages derived From change of scene ; for near his domicil , He of the pair of polish 'd lamps then lived , And in my hero 's promenades , at will , Could he behold them burning — and their flame Kindled within his breast the love of fame ,</item>
     <item>XVII . And politics , and country ; the pure glow Of patriot ardour , and the consciousness That talents such as his might well bestow A lustre on the city ; she would bless His name ; and that some service should be done her , He pledged “ life , fortune , and his sacred honour . ”</item>
     <item>XVIII . And when the sounds of music and of mirth , Bursting from Fashion 's groups assembled there , Were heard , as round their lone plebeian hearth Fanny and he were seated — he would dare To whisper fondly , that the time might come When he and his could give as brilliant routs at home .</item>
     <item>XIX . And oft would Fanny near that mansion linger , When the cold winter moon was high in heaven , And trace out , by the aid of Fancy 's finger , Cards for some future party , to be given When she , in turn , should be a belle , and they Had lived their little hour , and pass 'd away .</item>
     <item>XX . There are some happy moments in this lone And desolate world of ours , that well repay The toil of struggling through it , and atone For many a long , sad night and weary day . They come upon the mind like some wild air Of distant music , when we know not where ,</item>
     <item>XXI . Or whence , the sounds are brought from , and their power , Though brief , is boundless . That far , future home , Oft dream 'd of , beckons near — it 's rose-wreathed bower , And cloudless skies before us : we become Changed on the instant — all gold leaf and gilding : This is , in vulgar phrase , call 'd “ castle building . ”</item>
     <item>XXII . But these , like sunset clouds , fade soon ; ‘ tis vain To bid them linger longer , or to ask On what day they intend to call again ; And , surely , ‘ twere a philosophic task , Worthy a Mitchill , in his hours of leisure , To find some means to summon them at pleasure .</item>
     <item>XXIII . There certainly are powers of doing this , In some degree at least — for instance , drinking . Champagne will bathe the heart a while in bliss , And keep the head a little time from thinking Of cares or creditors — the best wine in town You 'll get from Lynch — the cash must be paid down .</item>
     <item>XXIV . But if you are a bachelor , like me , And spurn all chains , even though made of roses , I 'd recommend segars — there is a free And happy spirit , that , unseen , reposes On the dim shadowy clouds that hover o'er you , When smoking quietly with a warm fire before you .</item>
     <item>XXV . Dear to the exile is his native land , In memory 's twilight beauty seen afar : Dear to the broker is a note of hand , Collaterally secured — the polar star Is dear at midnight to the sailor 's eyes , And dear are Bristed 's volumes at “ half price ; ”</item>
     <item>XXVI . But dearer far to me each fairy minute Spent in that fond forgetfulness of grief ; There is an airy web of magic in it , As in Othello 's pocket-handkerchief , Veiling the wrinkles on the brow of sorrow , The gathering gloom to-day , the thunder cloud to-morrow</item>
     <item>XXVII . And these are innocent thoughts — a man may sit Upon a bright throne of his own creation ; Untortured by the ghastly sprites that flit Around the many , whose exalted station Has been attained by means ‘ twere pain to hint on , Just for the rhyme 's sake — instance Mr. Cl * n * on .</item>
     <item>XXVIII . He struggled hard , but not in vain , and breathes The mountain air at last ; but there are others Who strove , like him , to win the glittering wreaths Of power , his early partisans and brothers , That linger yet in dust from whence they sprung , Unhonour 'd and unpaid , though , luckily , unhung .</item>
     <item>XXIX . ‘ Twas theirs to fill with gas the huge balloon Of party ; and they hoped , when it arose , To soar like eagles in the blaze of noon , Above the gaping crowd of friends and foes . Alas ! like Guille 's car , it soar 'd without them , And left them with a mob to jeer and flout them .</item>
     <item>XXX . Though Fanny 's moonlight dreams were sweet as those I 've dwelt so long upon — they were more stable ; Hers were not “ castles in the air ” that rose Based upon nothing ; for her sire was able , As well she knew , to “ buy out ” the one half Of Fashion 's glittering train , that nightly quaff</item>
     <item>XXXI . Wine , wit , and wisdom , at a midnight rout , From dandy coachmen , whose “ exquisite ” grin And “ ruffian ” lounge flash brilliantly without , Down to their brother dandies ranged within , Gay as the Brussels carpeting they tread on , And sapient as the oysters they are fed on .</item>
     <item>XXXII . And Rumour ( she 's a famous liar , yet ‘ Tis wonderful how easy we believe her ) Had whisper 'd he was rich , and all he met In Wall-street , nodded , smiled , and “ tipp 'd the beaver ; ” All , from Mr. Gelston , the collector , Down to the broker , and the bank director .</item>
     <item>XXXIII . A few brief years pass 'd over , and his rank Among the worthies of that street was fix 'd ; He had become director of a bank , And six insurance offices , and mix 'd Familiarly , as one among his peers , With grocers , dry-good merchants , auctioneers ,</item>
     <item>XXXIV . Brokers of all grades — stock and pawn — and Jews Of all religions , who at noonday form , On ‘ Change , that brotherhood the moral muse Delights in , where the heart is pure and warm , And each exerts his intellectual force To cheat his neighbour — legally , of course .</item>
     <item>XXXV . And there he shone a planetary star , Circled around by lesser orbs , whose beams From his were borrow 'd . The simile is not far From truth — for many bosom friends , it seems , Did borrow of him , and sometimes forget To pay — indeed , they have not paid him yet .</item>
     <item>XXXVI . But these he deem 'd as trifles , when each mouth Was open in his praise , and plaudits rose Upon his willing ear , “ like the sweet south Upon a bank of violets , ” from those Who knew his talents , virtues , and so forth ; That is — knew how much money he was worth .</item>
     <item>XXXVII . Alas ! poor human nature ; had he been But satisfied with this , his golden days Their setting hour of darkness had not seen , And he might still ( in the mercantile phrase ) Be living “ in good order and condition ; ” But he was ruined by that jade Ambition ,</item>
     <item>XXXVIII . “ That last infirmity of noble minds , ” Whose spell , like whiskey , your true patriot liquor , To politics the lofty hearts inclines Of all , from Clinton down to the bill-sticker Of a ward-meeting . She came slyly creeping To his bedside , where he lay snug and sleeping .</item>
     <item>XXXIX . Her brow was turban 'd with a bucktail wreath , A broach of terrapin her bosom wore , Tompkins ’ letter was just seen beneath Her arm , and in her hand on high she bore A National Advocate — Pell 's polite Review Lay at her feet — ‘ twas pommell 'd black and blue .</item>
     <item>XL . She was in fashion 's elegant undress , Muffled from throat to ankle ; and her hair Was all “ en papillotes , ” each auburn tress Prettily pinn 'd apart . You well might swear She was no beauty ; yet , when “ made up , ” ready For visiters , ‘ twas quite another lady .</item>
     <item>XLI . Since that wise pedant , Johnson , was in fashion , Manners have changed as well as moons ; and he Would fret himself once more into a passion , Should he return ( which heaven forbid ! ) , and see , How strangely from his standard dictionary , The meaning of some words is made to vary .</item>
     <item>XLII . For instance , an undress at present means The wearing a pelisse , a shawl , or so ; Or any thing you please , in short , that screens The face , and hides the form from top to toe ; Of power to brave a quizzing-glass , or storm — ‘ Tis worn in summer , when the weather 's warm .</item>
     <item>XLIII . But a full dress is for a winter 's night . The most genteel is made of “ woven air ; ” That kind of classic cobweb , soft and light , Which Lady Morgan 's Ida used to wear . And ladies , this aerial manner dress 'd in , Look Eve-like , angel-like , and interesting .</item>
     <item>XLIV . But Miss Ambition was , as I was saying , “ Deshabillee ” — his bedside tripping near , And , gently on his nose her fingers laying , She roar 'd out Tammany ! in his frighted ear . The potent word awoke him from his nap , And then she vanish 'd , whisp'ring verbum sap .</item>
     <item>XLV . The last words were beyond his comprehension , For he had left off schooling , ere the Greek Or Latin classics claim 'd his mind 's attention : Besides , he often had been heard to speak Contemptuously of all that sort of knowledge , Taught so profoundly in Columbia College .</item>
     <item>XLVI . We owe the ancients something . You have read Their works , no doubt — at least in a translation ; Yet there was argument in what he said , I scorn equivocation or evasion , And own it must , in candour , be confess 'd , They were an ignorant set of men at best .</item>
     <item>XLVII . ‘ Twas their misfortune to be born too soon By centuries , and in the wrong place too ; They never saw a steamboat , or balloon , Velocipede , or Quarterly Review ; Or wore a pair of Baehr 's black satin breeches , Or read an Almanac , or Clinton 's Speeches .</item>
     <item>XLVIII . In short , in every thing we far outshine them ,— Art , science , taste , and talent ; and a stroll Through this enlighten 'd city would refine them More than ten years hard study of the whole Their genius has produced of rich and rare — God bless the Corporation and the Mayor !</item>
     <item>XLIX . In sculpture , we 've a grace the Grecian master , Blushing , had own 'd his purest model lacks ; We 've Mr. Bogart in the best of plaster , The Witch of Endor in the best of wax , Besides the head of Franklin on the roof Of Mr. Lang , both jest and weather proof .</item>
     <item>L. And on our City Hall a Justice stands ; A neater form was never made of board , Holding majestically in her hands A pair of steelyards and a wooden sword ; And looking down with complaisant civility — Emblem of dignity and durability .</item>
     <item>LI . In painting , we have Trumbull 's proud chef d'oeuvre , Blending in one the funny and the fine : His “ Independence ” will endure for ever , And so will Mr. Allen 's lottery sign ; And all that grace the Academy of Arts , From Dr. Hosack 's face to Bonaparte 's .</item>
     <item>LII . In architecture , our unrivall 'd skill Cullen 's magnesian shop has loudly spoken To an admiring world ; and better still Is Gautier 's fairy palace at Hoboken . In music , we 've the Euterpian Society , And amateurs , a wonderful variety .</item>
     <item>LIII . In physic , we have Francis and M'Neven , Famed for long heads , short lectures , and long bills ; And Quackenboss and others , who from heaven Were rain 'd upon us in a shower of pills ; They 'd beat the deathless Esculapius hollow , And make a starveling druggist of Apollo .</item>
     <item>LIV . And who , that ever slumber 'd at the Forum , But owns the first of orators we claim ; Cicero would have bow 'd the knee before ‘ em — And for law eloquence , we 've Doctor Graham . Compared with him , their Justins and Quintillians Had dwindled into second-rate civilians .</item>
     <item>LV . For purity and chastity of style , There 's Pell 's preface , and puffs by Horne and Waite . For penetration deep , and learned toil , And all that stamps an author truly great , Have we not Bristed 's ponderous tomes ? a treasure For any man of patience and of leisure .</item>
     <item>LVI . Oxonian Bristed ! many a foolscap page He , in his time , hath written , and moreover ( What few will do in this degenerate age ) Hath read his own works , as you may discover By counting his quotations from himself — You 'll find the books on any auction shelf .</item>
     <item>LVII . I beg Great Britain 's pardon ; ‘ tis not meant To claim this Oxford scholar as our own : That he was shipp 'd off here to represent Her literature among us , is well known ; And none could better fill the lofty station Of Learning 's envoy from the British nation .</item>
     <item>LVIII . We fondly hope that he will be respected At home , and soon obtain a place or pension . We should regret to see him live neglected , Like Fearon , Ashe , and others we could mention ; Who paid us friendly visits to abuse Our country , and find food for the reviews .</item>
     <item>LIX . But to return .— The Heliconian waters Are sparkling in their native fount no more , And after years of wandering , the nine daughters Of poetry have found upon our shore A happier home , and on their sacred shrines Glow in immortal ink , the polish 'd lines</item>
     <item>LX . Of Woodworth , Doctor Farmer , Moses Scott — Names hallow 'd by their reader 's sweetest smile ; And who that reads at all has read them not ? “ That blind old man of Scio 's rocky isle , ” Homer , was well enough ; but would he ever Have written , think ye , the Backwoodsman ? never .</item>
     <item>LXI . Alas ! for Paulding — I regret to see In such a stanza one whose giant powers , Seen in their native element , will be Known to a future age , the pride of ours . There is none breathing who can better wield The battle-axe of satire . On its field</item>
     <item>LXII . The wreath he fought for he has bravely won , Long be its laurel green around his brow ! It is too true , I 'm somewhat fond of fun And jesting ; but for once I 'm serious now . Why is he sipping weak Castalian dews ? The muse has damn 'd him — let him damn the muse</item>
     <item>LXIII . But to return once more : the ancients fought Some tolerable battles . Marathon Is still a theme for high and holy thought , And many a poet 's lay . We linger on The page that tells us of the brave and free , And reverence thy name , unmatch 'd Thermopylae .</item>
     <item>LXIV . And there were spirited troops in other days — The Roman legion and the Spartan band , And Swartwout 's gallant corps , the Iron Grays — Soldiers who met their foemen hand to hand , Or swore , at least , to meet them undismay 'd ; Yet what were these to General Laight 's brigade</item>
     <item>LXV . Of veterans ? nursed in that Free School of glory , The New-York State Militia . From Bellevue , E'en to the Battery flagstaff , the proud story Of their manoeuvres at the last review Has rang ; and Clinton 's “ order ” told afar He never led a better corps to war .</item>
     <item>LXVI . What , Egypt , was thy magic , to the tricks Of Mr. Charles , Judge Spencer , or Van Buren ? The first with cards , the last in politics , A conjuror 's fame for years have been securing . And who would now the Athenian dramas read When he can get “ Wall-street , ” by Mr. Mead .</item>
     <item>LXVII . I might say much about our letter 'd men , Those “ grave and reverend seigniors , ” who compose Our learn 'd societies — but here my pen Stops short ; for they themselves , the rumour goes , The exclusive privilege by patent claim , Of trumpeting ( as the phrase is ) their own fame .</item>
     <item>LXVIII . And , therefore , I am silent . It remains To bless the hour the Corporation took it Into their heads to give the rich in brains , The worn-out mansion of the poor in pocket , Once “ the old almshouse , ” now a school of wisdom , Sacred to Scudder 's shells and Dr. Griscom .</item>
     <item>LXIX . But whither am I wandering ? The esteem I bear “ this fair city of the heart , ” To me a dear enthusiastic theme , Has forced me , all unconsciously , to part Too long from him , the hero of my story . Where was he ?— waking from his dream of glory .</item>
     <item>LXX . And she , the lady of his dream , had fled , And left him somewhat puzzled and confused . He understood , however , half she said ; And that is quite as much as we are used To comprehend , or fancy worth repeating , In speeches heard at any public meeting .</item>
     <item>LXXI . And the next evening found him at the Hall ; There he was welcomed by the cordial hand , And met the warm and friendly grasp of all Who take , like watchmen , there , their nightly stand , A ring , as in a boxing match , procuring , To bet on Clinton , Tompkins , or Van Buren .</item>
     <item>LXXII . ‘ Twas a propitious moment ; for a while The waves of party were at rest . Upon Each complacent brow was gay good humour 's smile ; And there was much of wit , and jest , and pun , And high amid the circle , in great glee , Sat Croaker 's old acquaintance , John Targee .</item>
     <item>LXXIII . His jokes excell 'd the rest , and oft he sang Songs , patriotic , as in duty bound . He had a little of the “ nasal twang Heard at conventicle ; ” but yet you found In him a dash of purity and brightness , That spoke the man of taste and of politeness .</item>
     <item>LXXIV . For he had been , it seems , the bosom friend Of England 's prettiest bard , Anacreon Moore . They met when he , the bard , came here to lend His mirth and music to this favourite shore ; For , as the proverb saith , “ birds of a feather Instinctively will flock and fly together . ”</item>
     <item>LXXV . The winds that wave thy cedar boughs are breathing , “ Lake of the Dismal Swamp ! ” that poet 's name ; And the spray-showers their noonday halos wreathing Around “ Cohoes , ” are brighten 'd by his fame . And bright its sunbeam o'er St. Lawrence smiles , Her million lilies , and her thousand isles .</item>
     <item>LXXVI . We hear his music in her oarsmen 's lay , And where her church-bells “ toll the evening chime ; ” Yet when to him the grateful heart would pay Its homage , now , and in all coming time , Up springs a doubtful question whether we Owe it to Tara 's minstrel or Targee .</item>
     <item>LXXVII . Together oft they wander 'd — many a spot Now consecrated , as the minstrel 's theme , By words of beauty ne'er to be forgot , Their mutual feet have trod ; and when the stream Of thought and feeling flow 'd in mutual speech , ‘ Twere vain to tell how much each taught to each .</item>
     <item>LXXVIII . But , from the following song , it would appear That he of Erin from the sachem took The model of his “ Bower of Bendemeer , ” One of the sweetest airs in Lalla Rookh ; ‘ Tis to be hoped that in his next edition , This , the original , will find admission . SONG . There 's a barrel of porter at Tammany Hall , And the bucktails are swigging it all the night long ; In the time of my boyhood ‘ twas pleasant to call For a seat and segar , mid the jovial throng . That beer and those bucktails I never forget ; But oft , when alone , and unnoticed by all , I think , is the porter cask foaming there yet ? Are the bucktails still swigging at Tammany Hall ? No ! the porter was out long before it was stale , But some blossoms on many a nose brightly shone ; And the speeches inspired by the fumes of the ale , Had the fragrance of porter when porter was gone . How much Cozzens will draw of such beer ere he dies , Is a question of moment to me and to all ; For still dear to my soul , as ‘ twas then to my eyes , Is that barrel of porter at Tammany Hall . SONG . There 's a bower of roses by Bendemeer 's stream , And the nightingale sings round it all the night long , In the time of my childhood ‘ twas like a sweet dream To sit in the roses and hear the bird 's song . That bower and its music I never forget ; But oft , when alone , in the bloom of the year , I think , is the nightingale singing there yet ? Are the roses still bright by the calm Bendemeer ? No ! the roses soon wither 'd that hung o'er the wave , But some blossoms were gather 'd while freshly they shone ; And a dew was distill 'd from their flowers , that gave All the fragrance of summer when summer was gone . Thus memory draws from delight ere it dies , An essence that breathes of it many a year ; Thus bright to my soul , as ‘ twas then to my eyes , Is that bower on the banks of the calm Bendemeer .</item>
     <item>LXXIX . For many months my hero ne'er neglected To take his ramble there , and soon found out , In much less time than one could have expected , What ‘ twas they all were quarrelling about . He learn 'd the party countersigns by rote , And when to clap his hands , and how to vote .</item>
     <item>LXXX . He learn 'd that Clinton became Governor Somehow by chance , when we were all asleep ; That he had neither sense , nor talent , nor Any good quality , and would not keep His place an hour after the next election — So powerful was the voice of disaffection .</item>
     <item>LXXXI . That he was a mere puppet made to play A thousand tricks , while Spencer touch 'd the springs — Spencer , the mighty Warwick of his day , “ That setter up , and puller down of kings , ” Aided by Miller , Pell , and Doctor Graham , And other men of equal worth and fame .</item>
     <item>LXXXII . And that he 'd set the people at defiance , By placing knaves and fools in public stations ; And that his works in literature and science Were but a schoolboy 's web of misquotations ; And that he 'd quoted from the devil even — “ Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven . ”</item>
     <item>LXXXIII . To these authentic facts each bucktail swore ; But Clinton 's friends averr 'd , in contradiction , They were but fables , told by Mr. Noah , Who had a privilege to deal in fiction , Because he 'd written travels , and a melo - Drama ; and was , withal , a pleasant fellow .</item>
     <item>LXXXIV . And they declared that Tompkins was no better Than he should be ; that he had borrow 'd money , And paid it — not in cash — but with a letter ; And though some trifling service he had done , he Still wanted spirit , energy , and fire ; And was disliked by — Mr. M'Intyre .</item>
     <item>LXXXV . In short , each one with whom in conversation He join 'd , contrived to give him different views Of men and measures ; and the information Which he obtain 'd , but aided to confuse His brain . At best , ‘ twas never very clear ; And now ‘ twas turn 'd with politics and beer .</item>
     <item>LXXXVI . And he was puff 'd , and flatter 'd , and caress 'd By all , till he sincerely thought that nature Had form 'd him for an alderman at least — Perhaps , a member of the legislature ; And that he had the talents , ten times over , Of H * n * y M ** gs , or P * t * r H. W * nd * ver .</item>
     <item>LXXXVII . The man was mad , ‘ tis plain , and merits pity , Or he had never dared , in such a tone , To speak of two great persons , whom the city , With pride and pleasure , points to as her own . Men , wise in council , brilliant in debate , “ The expectancy and rose of the fair state . ”</item>
     <item>LXXXVIII . The one — for a pure style and classic manner , Is — Mr. Sachem Mooney far before . The other , in his speech about the banner , Spell-bound his audience until they swore That such a speech was never heard till then , And never would be — till he spoke again .</item>
     <item>LXXXIX . Though ‘ twas presumptuous in this friend of ours To think of rivalling these , I must allow That still the man had talents ; and the powers Of his capacious intellect were now Improved by foreign travel , and by reading , And at the Hall he 'd learn 'd , of course , good breeding .</item>
     <item>XC . He had read the newspapers with great attention , Advertisements and all ; and Riley 's book Of travels — valued for its rich invention ; And Day and Turner 's Price Current ; and took The Edinburgh and Quarterly Reviews ; And also Colonel Pell 's ; and , to amuse</item>
     <item>XCI . His leisure hours with classic tale and story , Longworth 's Directory , and Mead 's Wall-street , And Mr. Delaplaine 's Repository ; And Mitchill 's scientific works complete , With other standard books of modern days , Lay on his table , cover 'd with green baize .</item>
     <item>XCII . His travels had extended to Bath races ; And Bloomingdale and Bergen he had seen , And Harlaem Heights ; and many other places , By sea and land , had visited ; and been , In a steamboat of the Vice President 's , To Staten-Island once — for fifty cents .</item>
     <item>XCIII . And he had dined , by special invitation , On turtle , with “ the party ” at Hoboken ; And thank 'd them for his card in an oration , Declared to be the shortest ever spoken . And he had stroll 'd one day o'er Weehawk hill : A day worth all the rest — he recollects it still .</item>
     <item>XCIV . Weehawken ! In thy mountain scenery yet , All we adore of nature in her wild And frolic hour of infancy , is met ; And never has a summer 's morning smiled Upon a lovelier scene , than the full eye Of the enthusiast revels on — when high</item>
     <item>XCV . Amid thy forest solitudes , he climbs O'er crags , that proudly tower above the deep , And knows that sense of danger which sublimes The breathless moment — when his daring step Is on the verge of the cliff , and he can hear The low dash of the wave with startled ear ,</item>
     <item>XCVI . Like the death-music of his coming doom , And clings to the green turf with desperate force , As the heart clings to life ; and when resume The currents in his veins their wonted course , There lingers a deep feeling — like the moan Of wearied ocean , when the storm is gone .</item>
     <item>XCVII . In such an hour he turns , and on his view , Ocean , and earth , and heaven , burst before him ; Clouds slumbering at his feet , and the clear blue Of summer 's sky in beauty bending o'er him — The city bright below ; and far away , Sparkling in golden light , his own romantic bay .</item>
     <item>XCVIII . Tall spire , and glittering roof , and battlement , And banners floating in the sunny air ; And white sails o'er the calm blue waters bent , Green isle , and circling shore , are blended there In wild reality . When life is old , And many a scene forgot , the heart will hold</item>
     <item>XCIX . Its memory of this ; nor lives there one Whose infant breath was drawn , or boyhood 's days Of happiness were pass 'd beneath that sun , That in his manhood 's prime can calmly gaze Upon that bay , or on that mountain stand , Nor feel the prouder of his native land . C. “ This may be poetry , for aught I know , ” Said an old , worthy friend of mine , while leaning Over my shoulder as I wrote , “ although I can n't exactly comprehend its meaning . For my part , I have long been a petitioner To Mr. John M'Comb , the street-commissioner , CI . “ That he would think of Weehawk , and would lay it Handsomely out in avenue and square ; Then tax the land , and make its owners pay it ( As is the usual plan pursued elsewhere ) ; Blow up the rocks , and sell the wood for fuel — ‘ Twould save us many a dollar , and a duel . ” CII . The devil take you and John M'Comb , said I ; Lang , in its praise , has penn 'd one paragraph , And promised me another . I defy , With such assistance , yours and the world 's laugh ; And half believe that Paulding , on this theme , Might be a poet — strange as it may seem . CIII . For even our traveller felt , when home returning From that day 's tour , as on the deck he stood , The fire of poetry within him burning ; “ Albeit unused to the rhyming mood ; ” And with a pencil on his knee he wrote The following flaming lines TO THE HORSEBOAT .</item>
     <item>1 Away — o'er the wave to the home we are seeking , Bark of my hope ! ere the evening be gone ; There 's a wild , wild note in the curlew 's shrieking ; There 's a whisper of death in the wind 's low moan .</item>
     <item>2 Though blue and bright are the heavens above me , And the stars are asleep on the quiet sea ; And hearts I love , and hearts that love me , Are beating beside me merrily ,</item>
     <item>3 Yet , far in the west , where the day 's faded roses , Touch 'd by the moonbeam , are withering fast ; Where the half-seen spirit of twilight reposes , Hymning the dirge of the hours that are past ,</item>
     <item>4 There , where the ocean-wave sparkles at meeting ( As sunset dreams tell us ) the kiss of the sky , On his dim , dark cloud is the infant storm sitting , And beneath the horizon his lightnings are nigh .</item>
     <item>5 Another hour — and the death-word is given , Another hour — and his lightnings are here ; Speed ! speed thee , my bark ; ere the breeze of even Is lost in the tempest , our home will be near .</item>
     <item>6 Then away o'er the wave , while thy pennant is streaming In the shadowy light , like a shooting star ; Be swift as the thought of the wanderer , dreaming , In a stranger land , of his fireside afar .</item>
     <item>7 And while memory lingers I 'll fondly believe thee A being with life and its best feelings warm ; And freely the wild song of gratitude weave thee , Bless 'd spirit ! that bore me and mine from the storm . CIV . But where is Fanny ? She has long been thrown Where cheeks and roses wither — in the shade . The age of chivalry , you know , is gone ; And although , as I once before have said , I love a pretty face to adoration , Yet , still , I must preserve my reputation , CV . As a true dandy of the modern schools . One hates to be oldfashion 'd ; it would be A violation of the latest rules , To treat the sex with too much courtesy . ‘ Tis not to worship beauty , as she glows In all her diamond lustre , that the beaux CVI . Of these enlighten 'd days at evening crowd , Where fashion welcomes in her rooms of light , That “ dignified obedience ; that proud Submission , ” which , in times of yore , the knight Gave to his “ ladye-love , ” is now a scandal , And practised only by your Goth or Vandal . CVII . To lounge in graceful attitudes — be stared Upon , the while , by every fair one 's eye , And stare one 's self , in turn ; to be prepared To dart upon the trays , as swiftly by The dexterous Simon bears them , and to take One 's share , at least , of coffee , cream , and cake , CVIII . Is now to be “ the ton . ” The pouting lip , And sad , upbraiding eye of the poor girl , Who hardly of joy 's cup one drop can sip , Ere in the wild confusion , and the whirl , And tumult of the hour , its bubbles vanish , Must now be disregarded . One must banish CIX . Those antiquated feelings , that belong To feudal manners and a barbarous age . Time was — when woman “ pour 'd her soul ” in song , That all was hush 'd around . ‘ Tis now “ the rage ” To deem a song , like bugle-tones in battle , A signal note , that bids each tongue 's artillery rattle . CX . And , therefore , I have made Miss Fanny wait My leisure . She had changed , as you will see , as Much as her worthy sire , and made as great Proficiency in taste and high ideas . The careless smile of other days was gone , And every gesture spoke “ q'en dirahYpppHeNt ’ on ? ” CXI . She long had known that in her father 's coffers , And also to his credit in the banks , There was some cash ; and therefore all the offers Made her , by gentlemen of the middle ranks , Of heart and hand , had spurn 'd , as far beneath One whose high destiny it was to breathe , CXII . Ere long , the air of Broadway or Park Place , And reign a fairy queen in fairy land ; Display in the gay dance her form of grace , Or touch with rounded arm and gloveless hand , Harp or piano .— Madame Catilani Forgot a while , and every eye on Fanny . CXIII . And in anticipation of that hour , Her star of hope — her paradise of thought , She 'd had as many masters as the power Of riches could bestow ; and had been taught The thousand nameless graces that adorn The daughters of the wealthy and high born . CXIV . She had been noticed at some public places ( The Battery , and the balls of Mr. Whale ) , For hers was one of those attractive faces , That when you gaze upon them , never fail To bid you look again ; there was a beam , A lustre in her eye , that oft would seem CXV . A little like effrontery ; and yet The lady meant no harm ; her only aim Was but to be admired by all she met , And the free homage of the heart to claim ; And if she show 'd too plainly this intention , Others have done the same — ‘ twas not of her invention . CXVI . She shone at every concert ; where are bought Tickets , by all who wish them , for a dollar ; She patronised the Theatre , and thought That Wallack look 'd extremely well in Rolla ; She fell in love , as all the ladies do , With Mr. Simpson — talked as loudly , too , CXVII . As any beauty of the highest grade , To the gay circle in the box beside her ; And when the pit — half vex 'd and half afraid , With looks of smother 'd indignation eyed her , She calmly met their gaze , and stood before ‘ em , Smiling at vulgar taste and mock decorum . CXVIII . And though by no means a bas bleu , she had For literature a most becoming passion ; Had skimm 'd the latest novels , good and bad , And read the Croakers , when they were in fashion ; And Doctor Chalmers ’ sermons , of a Sunday ; And Woodworth 's Cabinet , and the new Salmagundi . CXIX . She was among the first and warmest patrons Of Griscom 's conversaziones where In rainbow groups , our bright-eyed maids and matrons , On science bent , assemble ; to prepare Themselves for acting well , in life , their part As wives and mothers . There she learn 'd by heart CXX . Words , to the witches in Macbeth unknown . Hydraulics , hydrostatics , and pneumatics , Dioptrics , optics , katoptrics , carbon , Chlorine , and iodine , and aerostatics ; Also ,— why frogs , for want of air , expire ; And how to set the Tappan sea on fire ! CXXI . In all the modern languages she was Exceedingly well versed ; and had devoted , To their attainment , far more time than has , By the best teachers lately , been allotted ; For she had taken lessons , twice a week , For a full month in each ; and she could speak CXXII . French and Italian , equally as well As Chinese , Portuguese , or German ; and , What is still more surprising , she could spell Most of our longest English words off hand ; Was quite familiar in Low Dutch and Spanish , And thought of studying modern Greek and Danish . CXXIII . She sang divinely : and in “ Love 's young dream , ” And “ Fanny dearest , ” and “ The soldier 's bride ; ” And every song , whose dear delightful theme , Is “ Love , still love , ” had oft till midnight tried Her finest , loftiest “ pigeon-wings ” of sound , Waking the very watchmen far around .

    <docDate>For her pure taste in dress , I can appeal to Madame Bouquet , and Monsieur Pardessus ; She was , in short , a woman you might kneel to , If kneeling were in fashion ; or if you Were wearied of your duns and single life , And wanted a few thousands and a wife .<date>1819</date>.

     <p>“ There was a sound of revelry by night ; ” Broadway was throng 'd with coaches , and within A mansion of the best of brick , the bright And eloquent eyes of beauty bade begin The dance ; and music 's tones swell 'd wild and high , And hearts and heels kept tune in tremulous ecstasy . CXXVII . For many a week , the note of preparation Had sounded through all circles far and near ; And some five hundred cards of invitation Bade beau and belle in full costume appear ; There was a most magnificent variety , All quite select , and of the first society . CXXVIII . That is to say — the rich and the well-bred , The arbiters of fashion and gentility , In different grades of splendour , from the head Down to the very toe of our nobility : Ladies , remarkable for handsome eyes Or handsome fortunes — learned men , and wise : CXXIX . Statesmen , and officers of the militia — In short , the “ first society ” — a phrase , Which you may understand as best may fit you Besides the blackest fiddlers of those days , Placed like their sire , Timotheus , on high , With horsehair fiddle-bows and teeth of ivory . CXXX .</p>

    <docImprint>The carpets were roll 'd up the day before , And , with a breath , two rooms became but one , Like man and wife — and , on the polish 'd floor , Chalk in the artists ’ plastic hand had done All that chalk could do — in young Eden 's bowers They seemed to tread , and their feet press 'd on flowers . CXXXI . And when the thousand lights of spermaceti Stream 'd like a shower of sunbeams — and free tresses Wild as the heads that waved them — and a pretty Collection of the latest<settlement>Paris</settlement>dresses Wander 'd about the rooms like things divine , It was , as I was told , extremely fine . CXXXII . The love of fun , fine faces , and good eating , Brought many who were tired of self and home ; And some were there in the high hope of meeting The lady of their bosom 's love — and some To study that deep science , how to please , And manners in high life , and high-soul 'd courtesies . CXXXIII . And he , the hero of the night , was there , In breeches of light drab , and coat of blue . Taste was conspicuous in his powder 'd hair , And in his frequent jeux de mots , that drew Peals of applauses from the listeners round , Who were delighted — as in duty bound . CXXXIV . ‘ Twas Fanny 's father — Fanny near him stood , Her power , resistless — and her wish , command ; And Hope 's young promises were all made good ; “ She reign 'd a fairy queen in fairy land ; ” Her dream of infancy a dream no more , And then how beautiful the dress she wore ! CXXXV . Ambition with the sire had kept her word . He had the rose , no matter for its thorn , And he seem 'd happy as a summer bird , Careering on wet wing to meet the morn . Some said there was a cloud upon his brow ; It might be — but we 'll not discuss that now . CXXXVI . I left him making rhymes while crossing o'er The broad and perilous wave of the North River . He bade adieu , when safely on the shore , To poetry — and , as he thought , for ever . That night his dream ( if after deeds make known Our plans in sleep ) was an enchanting one . CXXXVII . He woke , in strength , like Samson from his slumber , And walk 'd Broadway , enraptured the next day ; Purchased a house there — I 've forgot the number — And sign 'd a mortgage and a bond , for pay . Gave , in the slang phrase , Pearl-street the go-by , And cut , for several months , St. Tammany . CXXXVIII . Bond , mortgage , title-deeds , and all completed , He bought a coach and half a dozen horses ( The bill 's at Lawrence 's — not yet receipted — You 'll find the amount upon his list of losses ) , Then fill 'd his rooms with servants , and whatever Is necessary for a “ genteel liver . ” CXXXIX . This last removal fix 'd him : every stain Was blotted from his “ household coat , ” and he Now “ show 'd the world he was a gentleman , ” And , what is better , could afford to be ; His step was loftier than it was of old , His laugh less frequent , and his manner told CXL . What lovers call “ unutterable things ” — That sort of dignity was in his mien Which awes the gazer into ice , and brings To recollection some great man we 've seen , The Governor , perchance , whose eye and frown , ‘ Twas shrewdly guess 'd , would knock Judge Skinner down . CXLI . And for “ Resources , ” both of purse and head , He was a subject worthy Bristed 's pen ; Believed devoutly all his flatterers said , And deem 'd himself a Croesus among men ; Spread to the liberal air his silken sails , And lavish 'd guineas like a Prince of Wales . CXLII . He mingled now with those within whose veins The blood ran pure — the magnates of the land — Hail 'd them as his companions and his friends , And lent them money and his note of hand . In every institution , whose proud aim Is public good alone , he soon became CXLIII . A man of consequence and notoriety ; His name , with the addition of esquire , Stood high upon the list of each society , Whose zeal and watchfulness the sacred fire Of science , agriculture , art , and learning , Keep on our country 's altars bright and burning . CXLIV . At Eastburn 's Rooms he met , at two each day , With men of taste and judgment like his own , And play 'd “ first fiddle ” in that orchestra Of literary worthies — and the tone Of his mind 's music , by the listeners caught , Is traced among them still in language and in thought . CXLV . He once made the Lyceum a choice present Of muscle shells pick 'd up at Rockaway ; And Mitchill gave a classical and pleasant Discourse about them in the streets that day , Naming the shells , and hard to put in verse ‘ twas , “ Testaceous coverings of bivalve moluscas . ” CXLVI . He was a trustee of a Savings Bank , And lectured soundly every evil doer , Gave dinners daily to wealth , power , and rank , And sixpence every Sunday to the poor ; He was a wit , in the pun-making line — Past fifty years of age , and five feet nine . CXLVII . But as he trod to grandeur 's pinnacle , With eagle eye and step that never falter 'd , The busy tongue of scandal dared to tell That cash was scarce with him , and credit alter 'd ; And while he stood the envy of beholders , The Bank Directors grinn 'd , and shrugg 'd their shoulders . CXLVIII . And when these , the Lord Burleighs of the minute , Shake their sage heads , and look demure and holy , Depend upon it there is something in it ; For whether born of wisdom or of folly , Suspicion is a being whose fell power Blights every thing it touches , fruit and flower . CXLIX . Some friends ( they were his creditors ) once hinted About retrenchment and a day of doom ; He thank 'd them , as no doubt they kindly meant it , And made this speech , when they had left the room : “ Of all the curses upon mortals sent , One 's creditors are the most impudent ; CL . “ Now I am one who knows what he is doing , And suits exactly to his means his ends ; How can a man be in the path to ruin , When all the brokers are his bosom friends ? Yet , on my hopes , and those of my dear daughter , These rascals throw a bucket of cold water ! CLI . “ They 'd wrinkle with deep cares the prettiest face , Pour gall and wormwood in the sweetest cup , Poison the very wells of life — and place Whitechapel needles , with their sharp points up , Even in the softest feather bed that e'er Was manufactured by upholsterer . ” CLII . This said — he journey 'd “ at his own sweet will , ” Like one of Wordsworth 's rivers , calmly on ; But yet , at times , Reflection , “ in her still Small voice , ” would whisper , something must be done ; He ask 'd advice of Fanny , and the maid Promptly and duteously lent her aid . CLIII . She told him , with that readiness of mind And quickness of perception which belong Exclusively to gentle womankind , That to submit to slanderers was wrong , And the best plan to silence and admonish them , Would be to give “ a party ” — and astonish them . CLIV . The hint was taken — and the party given ; And Fanny , as I said some pages since , Was there in power and loveliness that even , And he , her sire , demean 'd him like a prince , And all was joy — it look 'd a festival , Where pain might smooth his brow , and grief her smiles recall . CLV . But Fortune , like some others of her sex , Delights in tantalizing and tormenting ; One day we feed upon their smiles — the next Is spent in swearing , sorrowing , and repenting . ( If in the last four lines the author lies , He 's always ready to apologize . ) CLVI . Eve never walk 'd in Paradise more pure Than on that morn when Satan play 'd the devil With her and all her race . A love-sick wooer Ne'er ask 'd a kinder maiden , or more civil , Than Cleopatra was to Antony The day she left him on the Ionian sea . CLVII . The serpent — loveliest in his coiled ring , With eye that charms , and beauty that outvies The tints of the rainbow — bears upon his sting The deadliest venom . Ere the dolphin dies Its hues are brightest . Like an infant 's breath Are tropic winds , before the voice of death CLVIII . Is heard upon the waters , summoning The midnight earthquake from its sleep of years To do its task of wo . The clouds that fling The lightning , brighten ere the bolt appears ; The pantings of the warrior 's heart are proud Upon that battle morn whose night-dews wet his shroud ; CLIX . The sun is loveliest as he sinks to rest ; The leaves of autumn smile when fading fast ; The swan 's last song is sweetest — and the best Of Meigs 's speeches , doubtless , was his last . And thus the happiest scene , in these my rhymes , Closed with a crash , and usher 'd in — hard times . CLX . St. Paul 's toll 'd one — and fifteen minutes after Down came , by accident , a chandelier ; The mansion totter 'd from the floor to rafter ! Up rose the cry of agony and fear ! And there was shrieking , screaming , bustling , fluttering , Beyond the power of writing or of uttering . CLXI . The company departed , and neglected To say good-by — the father storm 'd and swore — The fiddlers grinn 'd — the daughter look 'd dejected — The flowers had vanish 'd from the polish 'd floor , And both betook them to their sleepless beds , With hearts and prospects broken , but no heads . CLXII . The desolate relief of free complaining Came with the morn , and with it came bad weather ; The wind was east-northeast , and it was raining Throughout that day , which , take it altogether , Was one whose memory clings to us through life , Just like a suit in Chancery , or a wife . CLXIII . That evening , with a most important face And dreadful knock , and tidings still more dreadful , A notary came — sad things had taken place ; My hero had forgot to “ do the needful ; ” A note ( amount not stated ) , with his name o n't , Was left unpaid — in short , he had “ stopp 'd payment . ” CLXIV . I hate your tragedies , both long and short ones ( Except Tom Thumb , and Juan 's Pantomime ) ; And stories woven of sorrows and misfortunes Are bad enough in prose , and worse in rhyme ; Mine , therefore , must be brief . Under protest His notes remain — the wise can guess the rest . CLXV . * * * * * CLXVI . For two whole days they were the common talk ; The party , and the failure , and all that , The theme of loungers in their morning walk , Porter-house reasoning , and tea-table chat . The third , some newer wonder came to blot them , And on the fourth , the “ meddling world ” forgot them . CLXVII . Anxious , however , something to discover , I pass 'd their house — the shutters were all closed ; The song of knocker and of bell was over ; Upon the steps two chimney sweeps reposed ; And on the door my dazzled eyebeam met These cabalistic words — “ this house to let . ” CLXVIII . They live now , like chameleons , upon air And hope , and such cold , unsubstantial dishes ; That they removed , is clear , but when or where None knew . The curious reader , if he wishes , May ask them , but in vain . Where grandeur dwells , The marble dome — the popular rumour tells ; CLXIX . But of the dwelling of the proud and poor From their own lips the world will never know When better days are gone — it is secure Beyond all other mysteries here below , Except , perhaps , a maiden lady 's age , When past the noonday of life 's pilgrimage . CLXX . Fanny ! ‘ twas with her name my song began ; ‘ Tis proper and polite her name should end it ; If in my story of her woes , or plan Or moral can be traced , ‘ twas not intended ; And if I 've wrong 'd her , I can only tell her I 'm sorry for it — so is my bookseller . CLXXI . I met her yesterday — her eyes were wet — She faintly smiled , and said she had been reading The Treasurer 's Report in the Gazette , M'Intyre ' s speech , and Campbell 's “ Love lies bleeding ; ” She had a shawl on , ‘ twas not a Cashmere one , And if it cost five dollars , ‘ twas a dear one . CLXXII . Her father sent to Albany a prayer For office , told how fortune had abused him , And modestly requested to be Mayor — The Council very civilly refused him ; Because , however much they might desire it , The “ public good , ” it seems , did not require it . CLXXIII . Some evenings since , he took a lonely stroll Along Broadway , scene of past joys and evils ; He felt that withering bitterness of soul , Quaintly denominated the “ blue devils ; ” And thought of Bonaparte and Belisarius , Pompey , and Colonel Burr , and Caius Marius , CLXXIV . And envying the loud playfulness and mirth Of those who pass 'd him , gay in youth and hope , He took at Jupiter a shilling 's worth Of gazing , through the showman 's telescope ; Sounds as of far-off bells came on his ears , He fancied ‘ twas the music of the spheres . CLXXV . He was mistaken , it was no such thing , ‘ Twas Yankee Doodle play 'd by Scudder 's band ; He mutter 'd , as he linger 'd listening , Something of freedom and our happy land ; Then sketch 'd , as to his home he hurried fast , This sentimental song — his saddest , and his last . I . Young thoughts have music in them , love And happiness their theme ; And music wanders in the wind That lulls a morning dream . And there are angel voices heard , In childhood 's frolic hours , When life is but an April day Of sunshine and of showers . II . There 's music in the forest leaves When summer winds are there , And in the laugh of forest girls That braid their sunny hair . The first wild bird that drinks the dew , From violets of the spring , Has music in his song , and in The fluttering of his wing . III . There 's music in the dash of waves When the swift bark cleaves their foam ; There 's music heard upon her deck , The mariner 's song of home , When moon and star beams smiling meet At midnight on the sea — And there is music — once a week In Scudder 's balcony . IV . But the music of young thoughts too soon Is faint , and dies away , And from our morning dreams we wake To curse the coming day . And childhood 's frolic hours are brief , And oft in after years Their memory comes to chill the heart , And dim the eye with tears . V. To-day , the forest leaves are green , They 'll wither on the morrow , And the maiden 's laugh be changed ere long To the widow 's wail of sorrow . Come with the winter snows , and ask Where are the forest birds ? The answer is a silent one , More eloquent than words . VI . The moonlight music of the waves In storms is heard no more , When the living lightning mocks the wreck At midnight on the shore , And the mariner 's song of home has ceased , His corse is on the sea — And music ceases when it rains In Scudder 's balcony .

     <p>“ On they move In perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood Of flutes and soft RECORDERS . ” Milton . “ Live in Settles numbers one day more ! ” Pope . My dear RECORDER , you and I Have floated down life 's stream together , And kept unharm 'd our friendship 's tie Through every change of Fortune 's sky , Her pleasant and her rainy weather . Full sixty times since first we met , Our birthday suns have risen and set , And time has worn the baldness now Of Julius Caesar on your brow ; Your brow , like his , a field of thought , With broad deep furrows , spirit-wrought , Whose laurel harvests long have shown As green and glorious as his own ; And proudly would the CAESAR claim Companionship with R * K * R 'S name , His peer in forehead and in fame . Both eloquent and learn 'd and brave , Born to command and skill 'd to rule , One made the citizen a slave , The other makes him more — a fool . The Caesar an imperial crown , His slaves ’ mad gift , refused to wear , The R * k * r put his fool 's cap on , And found it fitted to a hair ; The Caesar , though by birth and breeding , Travel , the ladies , and light reading , A gentleman in mien and mind , And fond of Romans and their mothers , Was heartless as the Arab 's wind , And slew some millions of mankind , Including enemies and others . The R * k * r , like Bob Acres , stood Edgeways upon a field of blood , The where and wherefore Swartwout knows , Pull 'd trigger , as a brave man should , And shot , God bless them — his own toes . The Caesar pass 'd the Rubicon With helm , and shield , and breastplate on , Dashing his war-horse through the waters ; The R * k * r would have built a barge Or steamboat at the city 's charge , And pass 'd it with his wife and daughters . But let that pass . As I have said , There 's naught , save laurels , on your head , And time has changed my clustering hair , And shower 'd the snow-flakes thickly there ; And though our lives have ever been , As different as their different scene ; Mine more renown 'd for rhymes than riches Yours less for scholarship than speeches ; Mine pass 'd in low-roof 'd leafy bower , Yours in high halls of pomp and power , Yet are we , be the moral told , Alike in one thing — growing old , Ripen 'd like summer 's cradled sheaf , Faded like autumn 's falling leaf — And nearing , sail and signal spread , The quiet anchorage of the dead . For such is human life , wherever The voyage of its bark may be , On home 's green-bank 'd and gentle river Or the world 's shoreless , sleepless sea . Yes , you have floated down the tide Of time , a swan in grace and pride And majesty and beauty , till The law , the Ariel of your will , Power 's best beloved , the law of libel ( A bright link in the legal chain ) Expounded , settled , and made plain , By your own charge , the jurors ’ Bible , Has clipp 'd the venom 'd tongue of slander , That dared to call you “ Party 's gander , The leader of the geese who make Our cities ’ parks and ponds their home , And keep her liberties awake By cackling , as their sires saved Rome . Grander of Party 's pond , wherein Lizard , and toad , and terrapin , Your alehouse patriots , are seen , In Faction 's feverish sunshine basking ; ” And now , to rend this veil of lies , Word-woven by your enemies , And keep your sainted memory free From tarnish with posterity , I take the liberty of asking Permission , sir , to write your life , With all its scenes of calm and strife , And all its turnings and its windings , A poem , in a quarto volume — Verse , like the subject , blank and solemn , With elegant appropriate bindings , Of rat and mole skin the one half , The other a part fox , part calf . Your portrait , graven line for line , From that immortal bust in plaster , The master piece of Art 's great master , Mr. Praxiteles Browere , Whose trowel is a thing divine , Shall smile and bow , and promise there , And twenty-nine fine forms and faces ( The Corporation and the Mayor ) , Linked hand in hand , like loves and graces , Shall hover o'er it , group 'd in air , With wild pictorial dance and song ; The song of happy bees in bowers , The dance of Guido 's graceful hours , All scattering Flushing 's garden flowers Round the dear head they 've loved so long . I know that you are modest , know That when you hear your merit 's praise , Your cheeks quick blushes come and go , Lily and rose-leaf , sun and snow , Like maidens ’ on their bridal days . I know that you would fain decline To aid me and the sacred nine , In giving to the asking earth The story of your wit and worth ; For if there be a fault to cloud The brightness of your clear good sense , It is , and be the fact allow 'd , Your only failing — Diffidence ! An amiable weakness — given To justify the sad reflection , That in this vale of tears not even A R * k * r is complete perfection , A most romantic detestation Of power and place , of pay and ration ; A strange unwillingness to carry The weight of honour on your shoulders , For which you have been named , the very Sensitive Plant of office-holders , A shrinking bashfulness , whose grace Gives beauty to your manly face . Thus shades the green and growing vine The rough bark of the mountain pine , Thus round her freedom 's waking steel Harmodius wreathed his country 's myrtle ; And thus the golden lemon 's peel Gives fragrance to a bowl of turtle . True , “ many a flower , ” the poet sings , “ Is born to blush unseen ; ” But you , although you blush , are not The flower the poets mean . In vain you wooed a lowlier lot : In vain you clipp 'd your eagle-wings — Talents like yours are not forgot And buried with earth 's common things . No ! my dear R * k * r , I would give My laurels , living and to live , Or as much cash as you could raise on Their value , by hypothecation , To be , for one enchanted hour , In beauty , majesty , and power , What you for forty years have been , The Oberon of life 's fairy scene . An anxious city sought and found you In a blessed day of joy and pride , Scepter 'd your jewell 'd hand , and crown 'd you Her chief , her guardian , and her guide . Honours which weaker minds had wrought In vain for years , and knelt and pray 'd for , Are all your own , unpriced , unbought , Or ( which is the same thing ) unpaid for . Painfully great ! against your will Her hundred offices to hold , Each chair with dignity to fill , And your own pockets with her gold . A sort of double duty , making Your task a serious undertaking . With what delight the eyes of all Gaze on you , seated in your Hall , Like Sancho in his island , reigning , Loved leader of its motley hosts Of lawyers and their bills of costs , And all things thereto appertaining , Such as crimes , constables , and juries , Male pilferers and female furies , The police and the polissons , Illegal right and legal wrong . Bribes , perjuries , law-craft , and cunning , Judicial drollery and punning ; And all the et ceteras that grace That genteel , gentlemanly place ! Or in the Council Chamber standing With eloquence of eye and brow , Your voice the music of commanding , And fascination in your bow , Arranging for the civic shows Your “ men in buckram , ” as per list , Your John Does and your Richard Roes , Those Dummys of your games of whist . The Council Chamber — where authority Consists in two words — a majority . For whose contractors ’ jobs we pay Our last dear sixpences for taxes , As freely as in Sylla 's day , Rome bled beneath his lictors ’ axes . Where — on each magisterial nose In colours of the rainbow linger , Like sunset hues on Alpine snows , The printmarks of your thumb and finger . Where he , the wisest of wild fowl , Bird of Jove 's blue-eyed maid — the owl , That feather 'd alderman , is heard Nightly , by poet 's ear alone , To other eyes and ears unknown , Cheering your every look and word , And making , room and gallery through , The loud , applauding echoes peal , Of his “ ou peut on etre mieux Qu'au sein de sa famille ? "[ A ] Oh for a herald 's skill to rank Your titles in their due degrees ! At Singsing — at the Tradesmen 's Bank , In Courts , Committees , Caucuses : At Albany , where those who knew The last year 's secrets of the great , Call you the golden handle to The earthen Pitcher of the State . ( Poor Pitcher ! that Van Buren ceases To want its service gives me pain , ‘ Twill break into as many pieces As Kitty 's of Coleraine . ) At Bellevue , on her banquet night , Where Burgundy and business meet , On others , at the heart 's delight , The Pewter Mug in Frankfort-street ; From Harlaem bridge to Whitehall dock , From Bloomingdale to Blackwell 's Isles , Forming , including road and rock , A city of some twelve square miles , O'er street and alley , square and block , Towers , temples , telegraphs , and tiles , O'er wharves whose stone and timbers mock The ocean 's and its navies ’ shock , O'er all the fleets that float before her O'er all their banners waving o'er her , Her sky and waters , earth and air — You are lord , for who is her lord mayor ? Where is he ? Echo answers , where And voices , like the sound of seas , Breathe in sad chorus , on the breeze , The Highland mourner 's melody — Oh HONE a rie ! Oh HONE a rie ! The hymn o'er happy days departed , The hope that such again may be , When power was large and liberal-hearted , And wealth was hospitality . One more request , and I am lost , If you its earnest prayer deny ; It is , that you preserve the most Inviolable secrecy As to my plan . Our fourteen wards Contain some thirty-seven bards , Who , if my glorious theme were known , Would make it , thought and word , their own , My hopes and happiness destroy , And trample with a rival 's joy Upon the grave of my renown . My younger brothers in the art , Whose study is the human heart — Minstrels , before whose spells have bow 'd The learn 'd , the lovely , and the proud , Ere their life 's morning hours are gone — Light hearts be theirs , the muse 's boon , And may their suns blaze bright at noon , And set without a cloud . HILLHOUSE , whose music , like his themes , Lifts earth to heaven — whose poet dreams Are pure and holy as the hymn Echoed from harps of seraphim , By bards that drank at Zion 's fountains When glory , peace , and hope were hers , And beautiful upon her mountains The feet of angel messengers . BRYANT , whose songs are thoughts that bless The heart , its teachers , and its joy , As mothers blend with their caress Lessons of truth and gentleness And virtue for the listening boy . Spring 's lovelier flowers for many a day Have blossom 'd on his wandering way , Beings of beauty and decay , They slumber in their autumn tomb ; But those that graced his own Green River , And wreathed the lattice of his home , Charm 'd by his song from mortal doom , Bloom on , and will bloom on for ever . And HALLECK — who has made thy roof , St. Tammany ! oblivion-proof — Thy beer illustrious , and thee A belted knight of chivalry ; And changed thy dome of painted bricks And porter casks and politics , Into a green Arcadian vale , With St * ph * n All * n for its lark , B * n B * il * y 's voice its watch-dog 's bark , And J * hn T * rg * e its nightingale . These , and the other THIRTY-FOUR , Will live a thousand years or more — If the world lasts so long . For me , I rhyme not for posterity , Though pleasant to my heirs might be The incense of its praise , When I , their ancestor , have gone , And paid the debt , the only one A poet ever pays . But many are my years , and few Are left me ere night 's holy dew , And sorrow 's holier tears , will keep The grass green where in death I sleep And when that grass is green above me , And those who bless me now and love me Are sleeping by my side , Will it avail me aught that men Tell to the world with lip and pen That once I lived and died ? No : if a garland for my brow Is growing , let me have it now , While I 'm alive to wear it ; And if , in whispering my name , There 's music in the voice of fame Like Garcia 's , let me hear it ! The Christmas holydays are nigh , Therefore , till Newyear 's Eve , good-by , Then revenons a nos moutons , Yourself and aldermen — meanwhile , Look o'er this letter with a smile ; And keep the secret of its song As faithfully , but not as long , As you have guarded from the eyes Of editorial Paul Prys , And other meddling , murmuring claimants , Those Eleusinian mysteries , The city 's cash receipts and payments . Yours ever , T. C. [ A ] A favourite French air . In English , “ where can one be more happy than in the bosom of one 's family ? ”</p>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="8">We do not blame you , W * lt * r B * wne ,</l>
       <l n="9">For a variety of reasons ;</l>
       <l n="10">You 're now the talk of half the town ,</l>
       <l n="11">A man of talent and renown ,</l>
       <l n="12">And will be for perhaps two seasons .</l>
       <l n="13">That face of yours has magic in it ;</l>
       <l n="14">Its smile transports us in a minute</l>
       <l n="15">To wealth and pleasure 's sunny bowers ;</l>
       <l n="16">And there is terror in its frown ,</l>
       <l n="17">Which , like a mower 's scythe , cuts down</l>
       <l n="18">Our city 's loveliest flowers .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="19">We therefore do not blame you , sir ,</l>
       <l n="20">Whate'er our cause of grief may be ;</l>
       <l n="21">And cause enough we have to “ stir</l>
       <l n="22">The very stones to mutiny . ”</l>
       <l n="23">You 've driven from the cash and cares</l>
       <l n="24">Of office , heedless of our prayers ,</l>
       <l n="25">Men who have been for many a year</l>
       <l n="26">To us and to our purses dear ,</l>
       <l n="27">And will be to our heirs for ever ,</l>
       <l n="28">Our tears , thanks to the snow and rain ,</l>
       <l n="29">Have swell 'd the brook in Maiden-lane</l>
       <l n="30">Into a mountain river ;</l>
       <l n="31">And when you visit us again ,</l>
       <l n="32">Leaning at Tammany on your cane ,</l>
       <l n="33">Like warrior on his battle blade ,</l>
       <l n="34">You 'll mourn the havoc you have made .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="35">There is a silence and a sadness</l>
       <l n="36">Within the marble mansion now ;</l>
       <l n="37">Some have wild eyes that threaten madness ,</l>
       <l n="38">Some think of “ kicking up a row . ”</l>
       <l n="39">Judge M * ll * r will not yet believe</l>
       <l n="40">That you have ventured to bereave</l>
       <l n="41">The city and its hall of him :</l>
       <l n="42">He has in his own fine way stated ,</l>
       <l n="43">“ The fact must be substantiated , ”</l>
       <l n="44">Before he 'll move a single limb .</l>
       <l n="45">He deems it cursed hard to yield</l>
       <l n="46">The laurel won in every field</l>
       <l n="47">Through sixteen years of party war ,</l>
       <l n="48">And to be seen at noon no more ,</l>
       <l n="49">Enjoying at his office door</l>
       <l n="50">The luxury of a tenth segar .</l>
       <l n="51">Judge Warner says that , when he 's gone ,</l>
       <l n="52">You 'll miss the true Dogberry breed ;</l>
       <l n="53">And Christian swears that you have done</l>
       <l n="54">A most UN-Christian deed .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="55">How could you have the heart to strike</l>
       <l n="56">From place the peerless Pierre Van Wyck ?</l>
       <l n="57">And the twin colonels , Haines and Pell ,</l>
       <l n="58">Squire Fessenden , and Sheriff Bell ;</l>
       <l n="59">M * rr * ll , a justice and a wise one ,</l>
       <l n="60">And Ned M'Laughlin the exciseman ;</l>
       <l n="61">The two health officers , believers</l>
       <l n="62">In Clinton and contagious fevers ;</l>
       <l n="63">The keeper of the city 's treasures ,</l>
       <l n="64">The sealer of her weights and measures ,</l>
       <l n="65">The harbour-master , her best bower</l>
       <l n="66">Cable in party 's stormy hour ;</l>
       <l n="67">Ten auctioneers , three bank directors ,</l>
       <l n="68">And Mott and Duffy , the inspectors</l>
       <l n="69">Of whiskey and of flour ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="70">It was but yesterday they stood</l>
       <l n="71">All ( ex-officio ) great and good .</l>
       <l n="72">But by the tomahawk struck down</l>
       <l n="73">Of party and of W * lt * r B * wne ,</l>
       <l n="74">Where are they now ? With shapes of air ,</l>
       <l n="75">The caravan of things that were ,</l>
       <l n="76">Journeying to their nameless home ,</l>
       <l n="77">Like Mecca 's pilgrims from her tomb ;</l>
       <l n="78">With the lost Pleiad ; with the wars</l>
       <l n="79">Of Agamemnon 's ancestors ;</l>
       <l n="80">With their own years of joy and grief ,</l>
       <l n="81">Spring 's bud , and autumn 's faded leaf ;</l>
       <l n="82">With birds that round their cradles flew ;</l>
       <l n="83">With winds that in their boyhood blew ;</l>
       <l n="84">With last night 's dream and last night 's dew .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="85">Yes , they are gone ; alas ! each one of them ;</l>
       <l n="86">Departed — every mother 's son of them .</l>
       <l n="87">Yet often , at the close of day ,</l>
       <l n="88">When thoughts are wing 'd and wandering , they</l>
       <l n="89">Come with the memory of the past ,</l>
       <l n="90">Like sunset clouds along the mind ,</l>
       <l n="91">Reflecting , as they 're flitting fast</l>
       <l n="92">In their wild hues of shade and light ,</l>
       <l n="93">All that was beautiful and bright</l>
       <l n="94">In golden moments left behind .</l>

       <l n="1">Dear ***, I am writing , not to you , but at you ,</l>
       <l n="2">For the feet of you tourists have no resting-place ;</l>
       <l n="3">But wherever with this the mail-pigeon may catch you ,</l>
       <l n="4">May she find you with gayety 's smile on your face ;</l>
       <l n="5">Whether chasing a snipe at the Falls of Cohoes ,</l>
       <l n="6">Or chased by the snakes upon Anthony 's Nose ;</l>
       <l n="7">Whether wandering , at Catskill , from Hotel to Clove ,</l>
       <l n="8">Making sketches , or speeches , puns , poems , or love ;</l>
       <l n="9">Or in old Saratoga 's unknown fountain-land ,</l>
       <l n="10">Threading groves of enchantment , half bushes , half sand ;</l>
       <l n="11">Whether dancing on Sundays , at Lebanon Springs ,</l>
       <l n="12">With those Madame Hutins of religion , the Shakers ;</l>
       <l n="13">Or , on Tuesdays , with maidens who seek wedding rings</l>
       <l n="14">At Ballston , as taught by mammas and match-makers ;</l>
       <l n="15">Whether sailing St. Lawrence , with unbroken neck ,</l>
       <l n="16">From her thousand green isles to her castled Quebec ;</l>
       <l n="17">Or sketching Niagara , pencil on knee</l>
       <l n="18">( The giant of waters , our country 's pet lion ) ,</l>
       <l n="19">Or dipp 'd at Long Branch , in the real salt sea ,</l>
       <l n="20">With a cork for a dolphin , a Cockney Arion ;</l>
       <l n="21">Whether roaming earth , ocean , or even the air ,</l>
       <l n="22">Like Dan O'Rourke ' s eagle — good luck to you there .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="23">For myself , as you 'll see by the date of my letter ,</l>
       <l n="24">I 'm in town , but of that fact the least said the better ;</l>
       <l n="25">For ‘ tis vain to deny ( though the city o'erflows</l>
       <l n="26">With well-dressed men and women , whom nobody knows )</l>
       <l n="27">That one rarely sees persons whose nod is an honour ,</l>
       <l n="28">A lady with fashion 's own impress upon her ;</l>
       <l n="29">Or a gentleman bless 'd with the courage to say ,</l>
       <l n="30">Like Morris ( the Prince Regent 's friend , in his day ) ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="33">Apropos — our friend A. chanced this morning to meet</l>
       <l n="34">The accomplish 'd Miss B. as he pass 'd Contoit 's Garden ,</l>
       <l n="35">Both in town in July !— he cross 'd over the street ,</l>
       <l n="36">And she enter 'd the rouge-shop of Mrs. St. Martin .</l>
       <l n="37">Resolved not to look at another known face ,</l>
       <l n="38">Through Leonard and Church streets she walked to Park Place ,</l>
       <l n="39">And he turn 'd from Broadway into Catharine-lane ,</l>
       <l n="40">And coursed , to avoid her , through alley and by-street ,</l>
       <l n="41">Till they met , as the devil would have it , again ,</l>
       <l n="42">Face to face , near the pump at the corner of Dey-st .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="43">Yet , as most of “ The Fashion ” are journeying now ,</l>
       <l n="44">With the brown hues of summer on cheek and on brow ,</l>
       <l n="45">The few “ gens comme il faut ” who are lingering here ,</l>
       <l n="46">Are , like fruits out of season , more welcome and dear .</l>
       <l n="47">Like “ the last rose of summer , left blooming alone , ”</l>
       <l n="48">Or the last snows of winter , pure ice of haut ton ,</l>
       <l n="49">Unmelted , undimm 'd by the sun 's brightest ray ,</l>
       <l n="50">And , like diamonds , making night 's darkness seem day .</l>
       <l n="51">One meets them in groups , that Canova might fancy ,</l>
       <l n="52">At our new lounge at evening , the Opera Francais ,</l>
       <l n="53">In nines like the Muses , in threes like the Graces ,</l>
       <l n="54">Green spots in a desert of commonplace faces .</l>
       <l n="55">The Queen , Mrs. Adams , goes there sweetly dress 'd</l>
       <l n="56">In a beautiful bonnet , all golden and flowery :</l>
       <l n="57">While the King , Mr. Bonaparte , smiles on Celeste ,</l>
       <l n="58">Heloise , and Hutin , from his box at the Bowery .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="59">For news , Parry still the North Sea is exploring ,</l>
       <l n="60">And the Grand Turk has taken , they say , the Acropolis ,</l>
       <l n="61">And we , in Swamp Place , have discover 'd , in boring ,</l>
       <l n="62">A mineral spring to refine the metropolis .</l>
       <l n="63">The day we discover 'd it was , by-the-way ,</l>
       <l n="64">In the life of the Cockneys , a glorious day .</l>
       <l n="65">For we all had been taught , by tradition and reading ,</l>
       <l n="66">That to gain what admits us to levees of kings ,</l>
       <l n="67">The gentleness , courtesy , grace of high breeding ,</l>
       <l n="68">The only sure way was to “ visit the Springs . ”</l>
       <l n="69">So the whole city visited Swamp Spring en masse ,</l>
       <l n="70">From attorney to sweep , from physician to paviour ,</l>
       <l n="71">To drink of cold water at sixpence a glass ,</l>
       <l n="72">And learn true politeness and genteel behaviour .</l>
