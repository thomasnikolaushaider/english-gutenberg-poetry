    <docTitle><titlePart>LITERARY FABLES OF YRIARTE . ( Tomas de Iriarte y Oropesa ) TRANSLATED FROM THE SPANISH , BY GEO . H. DEVEREUX .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint><settlement>BOSTON</settlement>: TICKNOR AND FIELDS . MDCCCLV . TO THE CLASS OF<date>1829</date>I DEDICATE THIS UNPRETENDING RESULT OF SOME LEISURE HOURS . I do not flatter myself that it will make any conspicuous addition to the worthy achievements that have already graced our roll with names that rank high in the lists of Science , Philosophy and Literature . But it is pleasant to me to connect this translation of a college text-book — used by us all , long ago , within the walls of old Harvard — with the memory of youthful pursuits that have never lost their charm for the mind , and early associations that retain , with all their original freshness and geniality , their hold upon the heart .</docImprint>
   </titlePage>
   <div type="preface">
    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">The Fable has always been a popular mode of conveying certain kinds of instruction . The brief and simple illustrations it affords give additional weight and point to moral apothegms or sententious criticisms . Like the feather on the shaft , they serve to increase the force and direct the aim more certainly to the mark . A pertinent fact or an apt fiction breathes , even into a dry and curt axiom , a living and practical interest which opens to it hearts and heads that would otherwise pass it by with indifference , or revolt from it with impatience . Many of these unpretending allegories have been familiar to us all , in childhood , in a great variety of dresses , and have long formed a standard part of our literature — congenial alike to nursery days and to mature age .</p>
    <p n="2">The fables contained in the little collection here translated are not , with one or two exceptions , found among the widely popular and familiar fables to which we have alluded . They were written in a foreign tongue , less generally understood , among us , than some other of the European languages ; and they are designed for a special and somewhat abstruse purpose . Both these circumstances tend to narrow their sphere of circulation ; and we presume that they form a book little known to most English readers .</p>
    <p n="3">If we do not err in our estimate of them , the Literary Fables of Don Thomas De Yriarte are well worthy of perusal . They are aptly and ingeniously adapted to the truths they seek to inculcate ; and they are remarkable for a terse simplicity of form and style , well suited to the objects and character of such productions . The maxims and criticisms they enforce must approve themselves to the mind , both of the professed scholar and the general reader .</p>
    <p n="4">The author was born in Teneriffe , A. D. 1750 , but was educated and resided at Madrid , where he died in 1791 , at the early age , of course , of forty-one years . His uncle , Don Juan De Yriarte , was the chief superintendent of the royal library ; and the nephew was educated under his auspices . In his eighteenth year , he commenced his literary career by the writing of dramas , and the translation of plays from the French for the Spanish stage . He spent his life in the duties of sundry offices under the government ; yet he very soon assumed and maintained a high consideration as a scholar and writer . His works , however , were of a character to command but little interest from posterity , with the exception of the fables translated in this little volume .</p>
    <p n="5">Of them , Professor Ticknor , from whose learned work on Spanish literature we have collected these details , speaks as follows :—</p>
    <p n="6">“ Here , he , in some degree , struck out a new path ; for he not only invented all his fictions , which no other fabulist , in modern times , had done , but restricted them all , in their moral purpose , to the correction of the faults and follies of men of learning — an application which had not before been thought of . They are written with great care , in no less than forty different measures , and show an extraordinary degree of ingenuity in adapting the attributes and instincts of animals to the instruction , not of mankind at large , as had always been done before , but to that of a separate and small class , between whom and the inferior creation the resemblance is rarely obvious . The task was certainly a difficult one . Perhaps , on this account , they are too narrative in their structure , and fail somewhat in the genial spirit which distinguishes Esop and La Fontaine , the greatest masters of Apologue and Fable . But their influence was so needed in the age of bad writing when they appeared , and they are , besides , so graceful in their versification , that they were not only received with great favor at first , but have never lost it since . ” — Ticknor 's Hist , of Span . Literature , vol . iii ., p. 279 .</p>
    <p n="7">We have endeavored to discharge with fidelity the duty of translation ; attempting to preserve the form and spirit of the author , as far as was consistent with giving the work an English dress . With this view , we have aimed to produce a literal and characteristic reflection of the original rather than an expanded and highly-wrought paraphrase . Where we could do so , we have sought to preserve the metre , or a nearly analogous one , in order , if possible , to give a clear idea of the Spanish work to the English reader . But this is not practicable in all cases . The peculiar construction of Spanish rhymes , together with the obstinacy with which some words and sentences refuse the stern yoke of our English rules , render the task , always hard , sometimes impossible . The terminal inflections of the Spanish language and its accentuation are widely different from those of the Anglo-Saxon ; and so axe the arbitrary arrangements of the rhythm , which are , in the latter , far more exacting and precise . The professed scholar will recognize and make due allowance for such obstacles . To the public at large we shall hope our little book may convey some instruction and amusement , in a palatable shape . If so , it may give , to a novel class of subjects , somewhat of the well-known interest inspired by the graceful and popular fictions of Esop , Gay and La Fontaine .</p>

    <head>INTRODUCTION .</head>
    <p n="10">FABLE I .</p>
    <p n="11">Long years ago , in far-off land , When every brute beast had a way , What he thought and felt , to say In language all could understand — The sagacious Elephant observed Among these creatures many a failing , And gross abuses , too , prevailing , Which strenuous reform deserved . He called them all , from far and near , His strictures on their ways to hear . With reverence the most profound His long proboscis swept the ground ; In careful phrase , well learned by heart , He then discharged the censor 's part — A thousand silly foibles noted , A thousand vicious actions quoted ; Envy , working sore vexation , Ostentatious insolence , Idleness , procrastination , The arrogance of ignorance .</p>
    <p n="12">His sound and noble counsel stirs The hearts of many listeners , Accepting , with due reverence , The dictates of his generous sense . The guileless Lamb and thrifty Ant , The Bee , frugal and provident , The trusty Setter , and the Dove , Ever faithful to her love , The obedient Horse , the Linnet shy , And the simple Butterfly . But , of the audience , a part not small Declared that their offended pride Such language plain could not abide ; Not they — no , not at all . The Tiger and rapacious Wolf , Opening their lank jaws ’ bloody gulf , Against the adviser rave ; His vile abuse , among the crowd , The venomous Serpent hissed aloud ; While , all around , the whispering tone Of Wasp and Hornet , Fly and Drone , A murmuring echo gave . The mischievous Balm-cricket leapt From the tumultuous throng ; The Locust spread his clanging wing , His greedy conscience felt the sting ; The wriggling Caterpillar crept His sneaking way along ; The Weasel arched his spiteful back ; The Fox kept silence shrewd ; The Monkey , sauciest of the pack , Mocked , with grimaces rude .</p>
    <p n="13">The stately Elephant looked down Upon the vexed turmoil : “ To each and all and yet to none , ” — Spake his calm voice above the broil ,— “ These censures I apply ; Let him who winces put them on ; Who not , hear quietly . ”</p>

     <l n="1">A Piedmontese a Bear had taught</l>
     <l n="2">Upon two legs the art of dancing ;</l>

     <l n="1">By a sense of their bad reputation molested ,</l>
     <l n="2">The Drones in grave council assembled one day ;</l>

     <l n="9">But the labor proved very distasteful , indeed ;</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">

     <l n="21">This done , with much self-satisfaction they stop .</l>

     <l n="14">To witness all his entertaining juggles .</l>
     <l n="15">First he played dead man ; then , like Harlequin ,</l>

     <l n="7">In dress of gaudy hues ,</l>
     <l n="8">Such as harlequin would choose ,</l>
     <l n="9">A Monkey tricked herself .</l>
     <l n="10">But I rather think the elf</l>
     <l n="11">From her master got her finery ;</l>
     <l n="12">For else , I hardly see</l>
     <l n="13">How Monkey could or cloth or tailor find find —</l>
     <l n="14">Yet so the story goes — but never mind .</l>
     <l n="15">Seeing herself so gay ,</l>
     <l n="16">She through the window sprang</l>
     <l n="17">Upon a roof that lay</l>
     <l n="18">Below , then took her way</l>
     <l n="19">Unto the far-off land of Tetuan .</l>
     <l n="20">The proverb do n't say this ;</l>
     <l n="21">But there a history is ,</l>
     <l n="22">Which I cannot call to mind ,—</l>
     <l n="23">For the book is very rare ,— -</l>
     <l n="24">Which doth the truth unravel</l>
     <l n="25">Whither she did travel ;</l>
     <l n="26">Which to discover must have cost a world of care</l>
     <l n="27">But the author does not say ,</l>
     <l n="28">And neither can I guess .</l>
     <l n="29">If by ship , or by the way</l>
     <l n="30">Of the Isthmus of Suez :</l>
     <l n="31">All that we know is , that she certainly went there .</l>
     <l n="32">Here our fine lady found</l>
     <l n="33">A jolly Monkey crew ,—</l>
     <l n="34">For Monkeys there abound ,—</l>
     <l n="35">But naked every one :</l>
     <l n="36">As no other style they knew</l>
     <l n="37">In the land of Tetuan .</l>
     <l n="38">Now the naked Monkeys crowd</l>
     <l n="39">An admiring glance to snatch ;</l>
     <l n="40">Homage to pay they press ;</l>
     <l n="41">And readily allowed ,</l>
     <l n="42">To the brainless little wretch ,</l>
     <l n="43">Wisdom and wit to match</l>
     <l n="44">The splendors of her dress .</l>
     <l n="45">And forthwith it was decided ,</l>
     <l n="46">By general accord ,</l>
     <l n="47">That to her should be confided ,</l>
     <l n="48">As ruler of the horde ,</l>
     <l n="49">A meditated foray</l>
     <l n="50">Far and wide about the land ,</l>
     <l n="51">A stock of food to gather</l>
     <l n="52">To feed the hungry band .</l>
     <l n="53">So the leader new set forth</l>
     <l n="54">With all her subject host ,</l>
     <l n="55">And , not alone her road ,</l>
     <l n="56">But her wits as well , she lost .</l>
     <l n="57">Over mountain , moor and valley ,</l>
     <l n="58">Forest , and ridge , and plain ,</l>
     <l n="59">Deserts , rivers and morasses ,</l>
     <l n="60">She dragged her wearied train .</l>
     <l n="61">When the day 's work was over</l>
     <l n="62">They could scarcely move a limb ;</l>

     <l n="66">It should be his luck to join —</l>
     <l n="67">That he would choose a captain</l>
     <l n="68">More skilled , if not so fine .</l>
     <l n="69">From toil and from vexation ,</l>
     <l n="70">They learned a lesson bitter —</l>

    <head>THE RICH MAN 'S LIBRARY .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In Madrid , there was a rich man — and , they say ,</l>
     <l n="2">That ten times as stupid , as rich , he was too ;—</l>
     <l n="3">Whose magnificent mansion made ample display</l>
     <l n="4">Of furniture gorgeous and costly and new .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">“ It vexes me much , that a house so complete , ” —</l>
     <l n="6">To this wealthy dolt , said a neighbor one day ,—</l>
     <l n="7">“ Should a Library lack ,— an ornament great ,—</l>
     <l n="8">So useful and elegant , too , by the way . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">“ To be sure , ” said the other , “ how strange that the case</l>
     <l n="10">To me never occurred ; I 'll supply the want soon .</l>
     <l n="11">There is time enough yet ; and , in the first place ,</l>
     <l n="12">I devote to the purpose the northern saloon .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">Send a cabinet-maker to put up some shelves ,</l>
     <l n="14">Capacious , well finished ,— no matter for cost ,</l>
     <l n="15">Then , in buying some books , we will busy ourselves ;—</l>
     <l n="16">To make it all perfect , no time shall be lost . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">The cases are done ; the owner he comes ,</l>
     <l n="18">Inspects and approves : “ And now , ” — said the snob ,—</l>
     <l n="19">“ I must go out and look up some twelve thousand tomes .</l>
     <l n="20">‘ Pon my honor , ‘ twill be a pretty good job .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">I am almost discouraged — of money a deal</l>
     <l n="22">It will take ; and ‘ tis work for a century , too .</l>
     <l n="23">Will it not be much better the cases to fill ,</l>
     <l n="24">With books made of pasteboard , as good to the view ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">Just think now — why not ? A painter I know ,</l>
     <l n="26">For such little jobs precisely the man ;</l>
     <l n="27">Can write titles out fair , and make pasteboard to show</l>
     <l n="28">Like leather or parchment , if any one can . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">And now to the work ,— books precious and rare ,</l>
     <l n="30">Both modern and ancient , he caused to be painted ;</l>
     <l n="31">And , besides printed volumes , he also takes care</l>
     <l n="32">To have manuscripts , too , in same guise represented .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">The precious old fool then , each day , set apart</l>
     <l n="34">Some hours to wander his library round ;</l>
     <l n="35">Till , learning the titles of many by heart ,</l>
     <l n="36">He thought himself grown to a scholar profound .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">Truly , what better needs the student ,— contented</l>
     <l n="38">Of books , nothing more than their titles , to know</l>
     <l n="39">Than to own a collection right skilfully painted ,</l>
     <l n="40">Of genuine volumes presenting the show ?</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ A strangely inconsistent crew ! ” —</l>
     <l n="2">Said the Viper to the simple Leech ,—</l>

     <l n="5">“ All very true , ” — the Leech replied ,—</l>
     <l n="6">“ But the two things are different quite .</l>
     <l n="7">I bite the sick , to give them aid ;</l>
     <l n="8">To kill the sound and well , you bite . ”</l>

     <l n="9">Now , gentle reader , with you take</l>
     <l n="10">This counsel , as we part :</l>
     <l n="11">And always due distinction make ,</l>
     <l n="12">If from the lash you smart .</l>
     <l n="13">Great is the difference between</l>
     <l n="14">Correction kind and malice keen .</l>
