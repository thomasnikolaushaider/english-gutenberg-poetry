    <head>THE FIRST BOOK</head>
     <l n="1">I , WHO erewhile the happy Garden sung</l>
     <l n="2">By one man 's disobedience lost , now sing</l>
     <l n="3">Recovered Paradise to all mankind ,</l>
     <l n="4">By one man 's firm obedience fully tried</l>
     <l n="5">Through all temptation , and the Tempter foiled</l>
     <l n="6">In all his wiles , defeated and repulsed ,</l>
     <l n="7">And Eden raised in the waste Wilderness .</l>
     <l n="8">Thou Spirit , who led'st this glorious Eremite</l>
     <l n="9">Into the desert , his victorious field</l>
     <l n="10">Against the spiritual foe , and brought'st him thence 10</l>
     <l n="11">By proof the undoubted Son of God , inspire ,</l>
     <l n="12">As thou art wont , my prompted song , else mute ,</l>
     <l n="13">And bear through highth or depth of Nature 's bounds ,</l>
     <l n="14">With prosperous wing full summed , to tell of deeds</l>
     <l n="15">Above heroic , though in secret done ,</l>
     <l n="16">And unrecorded left through many an age :</l>
     <l n="17">Worthy to have not remained so long unsung .</l>
     <l n="18">Now had the great Proclaimer , with a voice</l>
     <l n="19">More awful than the sound of trumpet , cried</l>
     <l n="20">Repentance , and Heaven 's kingdom nigh at hand 20</l>
     <l n="21">To all baptized . To his great baptism flocked</l>
     <l n="22">With awe the regions round , and with them came</l>
     <l n="23">From Nazareth the son of Joseph deemed</l>
     <l n="24">To the flood Jordan — came as then obscure ,</l>
     <l n="25">Unmarked , unknown . But him the Baptist soon</l>
     <l n="26">Descried , divinely warned , and witness bore</l>
     <l n="27">As to his worthier , and would have resigned</l>
     <l n="28">To him his heavenly office . Nor was long</l>
     <l n="29">His witness unconfirmed : on him baptized</l>
     <l n="30">Heaven opened , and in likeness of a Dove 30</l>
     <l n="31">The Spirit descended , while the Father 's voice</l>
     <l n="32">From Heaven pronounced him his beloved Son .</l>
     <l n="33">That heard the Adversary , who , roving still</l>
     <l n="34">About the world , at that assembly famed</l>
     <l n="35">Would not be last , and , with the voice divine</l>
     <l n="36">Nigh thunder-struck , the exalted man to whom</l>
     <l n="37">Such high attest was given a while surveyed</l>
     <l n="38">With wonder ; then , with envy fraught and rage ,</l>
     <l n="39">Flies to his place , nor rests , but in mid air</l>
     <l n="40">To council summons all his mighty Peers , 40</l>
     <l n="41">Within thick clouds and dark tenfold involved ,</l>
     <l n="42">A gloomy consistory ; and them amidst ,</l>
     <l n="43">With looks aghast and sad , he thus bespake :—</l>
     <l n="44">“ O ancient Powers of Air and this wide World</l>
     <l n="45">( For much more willingly I mention Air ,</l>
     <l n="46">This our old conquest , than remember Hell ,</l>
     <l n="47">Our hated habitation ) , well ye know</l>
     <l n="48">How many ages , as the years of men ,</l>
     <l n="49">This Universe we have possessed , and ruled</l>
     <l n="50">In manner at our will the affairs of Earth , 50</l>
     <l n="51">Since Adam and his facile consort Eve</l>
     <l n="52">Lost Paradise , deceived by me , though since</l>
     <l n="53">With dread attending when that fatal wound</l>
     <l n="54">Shall be inflicted by the seed of Eve</l>
     <l n="55">Upon my head . Long the decrees of Heaven</l>
     <l n="56">Delay , for longest time to Him is short ;</l>
     <l n="57">And now , too soon for us , the circling hours</l>
     <l n="58">This dreaded time have compassed , wherein we</l>
     <l n="59">Must bide the stroke of that long-threatened wound</l>
     <l n="60">( At least , if so we can , and by the head 60</l>
     <l n="61">Broken be not intended all our power</l>
     <l n="62">To be infringed , our freedom and our being</l>
     <l n="63">In this fair empire won of Earth and Air ) —</l>
     <l n="64">For this ill news I bring : The Woman 's Seed ,</l>
     <l n="65">Destined to this , is late of woman born .</l>
     <l n="66">His birth to our just fear gave no small cause ;</l>
     <l n="67">But his growth now to youth 's full flower , displaying</l>
     <l n="68">All virtue , grace and wisdom to achieve</l>
     <l n="69">Things highest , greatest , multiplies my fear .</l>
     <l n="70">Before him a great Prophet , to proclaim 70</l>
     <l n="71">His coming , is sent harbinger , who all</l>
     <l n="72">Invites , and in the consecrated stream</l>
     <l n="73">Pretends to wash off sin , and fit them so</l>
     <l n="74">Purified to receive him pure , or rather</l>
     <l n="75">To do him honour as their King . All come ,</l>
     <l n="76">And he himself among them was baptized —</l>
     <l n="77">Not thence to be more pure , but to receive</l>
     <l n="78">The testimony of Heaven , that who he is</l>
     <l n="79">Thenceforth the nations may not doubt . I saw</l>
     <l n="80">The Prophet do him reverence ; on him , rising 80</l>
     <l n="81">Out of the water , Heaven above the clouds</l>
     <l n="82">Unfold her crystal doors ; thence on his head</l>
     <l n="83">A perfet Dove descend ( whate'er it meant ) ;</l>
     <l n="84">And out of Heaven the sovraign voice I heard ,</l>
     <l n="85">‘ This is my Son beloved ,— in him am pleased . ’</l>
     <l n="86">His mother , than , is mortal , but his Sire</l>
     <l n="87">He who obtains the monarchy of Heaven ;</l>
     <l n="88">And what will He not do to advance his Son ?</l>
     <l n="89">His first-begot we know , and sore have felt ,</l>
     <l n="90">When his fierce thunder drove us to the Deep ; 90</l>
     <l n="91">Who this is we must learn , for Man he seems</l>
     <l n="92">In all his lineaments , though in his face</l>
     <l n="93">The glimpses of his Father 's glory shine .</l>
     <l n="94">Ye see our danger on the utmost edge</l>
     <l n="95">Of hazard , which admits no long debate ,</l>
     <l n="96">But must with something sudden be opposed</l>
     <l n="97">( Not force , but well-couched fraud , well-woven snares ) ,</l>
     <l n="98">Ere in the head of nations he appear ,</l>
     <l n="99">Their king , their leader , and supreme on Earth .</l>
     <l n="100">I , when no other durst , sole undertook 100</l>
     <l n="101">The dismal expedition to find out</l>
     <l n="102">And ruin Adam , and the exploit performed</l>
     <l n="103">Successfully : a calmer voyage now</l>
     <l n="104">Will waft me ; and the way found prosperous once</l>
     <l n="105">Induces best to hope of like success . ”</l>
     <l n="106">He ended , and his words impression left</l>
     <l n="107">Of much amazement to the infernal crew ,</l>
     <l n="108">Distracted and surprised with deep dismay</l>
     <l n="109">At these sad tidings . But no time was then</l>
     <l n="110">For long indulgence to their fears or grief : 110</l>
     <l n="111">Unanimous they all commit the care</l>
     <l n="112">And management of this man enterprise</l>
     <l n="113">To him , their great Dictator , whose attempt</l>
     <l n="114">At first against mankind so well had thrived</l>
     <l n="115">In Adam 's overthrow , and led their march</l>
     <l n="116">From Hell 's deep-vaulted den to dwell in light ,</l>
     <l n="117">Regents , and potentates , and kings , yea gods ,</l>
     <l n="118">Of many a pleasant realm and province wide .</l>
     <l n="119">So to the coast of Jordan he directs</l>
     <l n="120">His easy steps , girded with snaky wiles , 120</l>
     <l n="121">Where he might likeliest find this new-declared ,</l>
     <l n="122">This man of men , attested Son of God ,</l>
     <l n="123">Temptation and all guile on him to try —</l>
     <l n="124">So to subvert whom he suspected raised</l>
     <l n="125">To end his reign on Earth so long enjoyed :</l>
     <l n="126">But , contrary , unweeting he fulfilled</l>
     <l n="127">The purposed counsel , pre-ordained and fixed ,</l>
     <l n="128">Of the Most High , who , in full frequence bright</l>
     <l n="129">Of Angels , thus to Gabriel smiling spake :—</l>
     <l n="130">“ Gabriel , this day , by proof , thou shalt behold , 130</l>
     <l n="131">Thou and all Angels conversant on Earth</l>
     <l n="132">With Man or men 's affairs , how I begin</l>
     <l n="133">To verify that solemn message late ,</l>
     <l n="134">On which I sent thee to the Virgin pure</l>
     <l n="135">In Galilee , that she should bear a son ,</l>
     <l n="136">Great in renown , and called the Son of God .</l>
     <l n="137">Then told'st her , doubting how these things could be</l>
     <l n="138">To her a virgin , that on her should come</l>
     <l n="139">The Holy Ghost , and the power of the Highest</l>
     <l n="140">O'ershadow her . This Man , born and now upgrown , 140</l>
     <l n="141">To shew him worthy of his birth divine</l>
     <l n="142">And high prediction , henceforth I expose</l>
     <l n="143">To Satan ; let him tempt , and now assay</l>
     <l n="144">His utmost subtlety , because he boasts</l>
     <l n="145">And vaunts of his great cunning to the throng</l>
     <l n="146">Of his Apostasy . He might have learnt</l>
     <l n="147">Less overweening , since he failed in Job ,</l>
     <l n="148">Whose constant perseverance overcame</l>
     <l n="149">Whate'er his cruel malice could invent .</l>
     <l n="150">He now shall know I can produce a man , 150</l>
     <l n="151">Of female seed , far abler to resist</l>
     <l n="152">All his solicitations , and at length</l>
     <l n="153">All his vast force , and drive him back to Hell —</l>
     <l n="154">Winning by conquest what the first man lost</l>
     <l n="155">By fallacy surprised . But first I mean</l>
     <l n="156">To exercise him in the Wilderness ;</l>
     <l n="157">There he shall first lay down the rudiments</l>
     <l n="158">Of his great warfare , ere I send him forth</l>
     <l n="159">To conquer Sin and Death , the two grand foes .</l>
     <l n="160">By humiliation and strong sufferance 160</l>
     <l n="161">His weakness shall o'ercome Satanic strength ,</l>
     <l n="162">And all the world , and mass of sinful flesh ;</l>
     <l n="163">That all the Angels and aethereal Powers —</l>
     <l n="164">They now , and men hereafter — may discern</l>
     <l n="165">From what consummate virtue I have chose</l>
     <l n="166">This perfet man , by merit called my Son ,</l>
     <l n="167">To earn salvation for the sons of men . ”</l>
     <l n="168">So spake the Eternal Father , and all Heaven</l>
     <l n="169">Admiring stood a space ; then into hymns</l>
     <l n="170">Burst forth , and in celestial measures moved , 170</l>
     <l n="171">Circling the throne and singing , while the hand</l>
     <l n="172">Sung with the voice , and this the argument :—</l>
     <l n="173">“ Victory and triumph to the Son of God ,</l>
     <l n="174">Now entering his great duel , not of arms ,</l>
     <l n="175">But to vanquish by wisdom hellish wiles !</l>
     <l n="176">The Father knows the Son ; therefore secure</l>
     <l n="177">Ventures his filial virtue , though untried ,</l>
     <l n="178">Against whate'er may tempt , whate'er seduce ,</l>
     <l n="179">Allure , or terrify , or undermine .</l>
     <l n="180">Be frustrate , all ye stratagems of Hell , 180</l>
     <l n="181">And , devilish machinations , come to nought ! ”</l>
     <l n="182">So they in Heaven their odes and vigils tuned .</l>
     <l n="183">Meanwhile the Son of God , who yet some days</l>
     <l n="184">Lodged in Bethabara , where John baptized ,</l>
     <l n="185">Musing and much revolving in his breast</l>
     <l n="186">How best the mighty work he might begin</l>
     <l n="187">Of Saviour to mankind , and which way first</l>
     <l n="188">Publish his godlike office now mature ,</l>
     <l n="189">One day forth walked alone , the Spirit leading</l>
     <l n="190">And his deep thoughts , the better to converse 190</l>
     <l n="191">With solitude , till , far from track of men ,</l>
     <l n="192">Thought following thought , and step by step led on ,</l>
     <l n="193">He entered now the bordering Desert wild ,</l>
     <l n="194">And , with dark shades and rocks environed round ,</l>
     <l n="195">His holy meditations thus pursued :—</l>
     <l n="196">“ O what a multitude of thoughts at once</l>
     <l n="197">Awakened in me swarm , while I consider</l>
     <l n="198">What from within I feel myself , and hear</l>
     <l n="199">What from without comes often to my ears ,</l>
     <l n="200">Ill sorting with my present state compared ! 200</l>
     <l n="201">When I was yet a child , no childish play</l>
     <l n="202">To me was pleasing ; all my mind was set</l>
     <l n="203">Serious to learn and know , and thence to do ,</l>
     <l n="204">What might be public good ; myself I thought</l>
     <l n="205">Born to that end , born to promote all truth ,</l>
     <l n="206">All righteous things . Therefore , above my years ,</l>
     <l n="207">The Law of God I read , and found it sweet ;</l>
     <l n="208">Made it my whole delight , and in it grew</l>
     <l n="209">To such perfection that , ere yet my age</l>
     <l n="210">Had measured twice six years , at our great Feast 210</l>
     <l n="211">I went into the Temple , there to hear</l>
     <l n="212">The teachers of our Law , and to propose</l>
     <l n="213">What might improve my knowledge or their own ,</l>
     <l n="214">And was admired by all . Yet this not all</l>
     <l n="215">To which my spirit aspired . Victorious deeds</l>
     <l n="216">Flamed in my heart , heroic acts — one while</l>
     <l n="217">To rescue Israel from the Roman yoke ;</l>
     <l n="218">Then to subdue and quell , o'er all the earth ,</l>
     <l n="219">Brute violence and proud tyrannic power ,</l>
     <l n="220">Till truth were freed , and equity restored : 220</l>
     <l n="221">Yet held it more humane , more heavenly , first</l>
     <l n="222">By winning words to conquer willing hearts ,</l>
     <l n="223">And make persuasion do the work of fear ;</l>
     <l n="224">At least to try , and teach the erring soul ,</l>
     <l n="225">Not wilfully misdoing , but unware</l>
     <l n="226">Misled ; the stubborn only to subdue .</l>
     <l n="227">These growing thoughts my mother soon perceiving ,</l>
     <l n="228">By words at times cast forth , inly rejoiced ,</l>
     <l n="229">And said to me apart , ‘ High are thy thoughts ,</l>
     <l n="230">O Son ! but nourish them , and let them soar 230</l>
     <l n="231">To what highth sacred virtue and true worth</l>
     <l n="232">Can raise them , though above example high ;</l>
     <l n="233">By matchless deeds express thy matchless Sire .</l>
     <l n="234">For know , thou art no son of mortal man ;</l>
     <l n="235">Though men esteem thee low of parentage ,</l>
     <l n="236">Thy Father is the Eternal King who rules</l>
     <l n="237">All Heaven and Earth , Angels and sons of men .</l>
     <l n="238">A messenger from God foretold thy birth</l>
     <l n="239">Conceived in me a virgin ; he foretold</l>
     <l n="240">Thou shouldst be great , and sit on David 's throne , 240</l>
     <l n="241">And of thy kingdom there should be no end .</l>
     <l n="242">At thy nativity a glorious quire</l>
     <l n="243">Of Angels , in the fields of Bethlehem , sung</l>
     <l n="244">To shepherds , watching at their folds by night ,</l>
     <l n="245">And told them the Messiah now was born ,</l>
     <l n="246">Where they might see him ; and to thee they came ,</l>
     <l n="247">Directed to the manger where thou lay'st ;</l>
     <l n="248">For in the inn was left no better room .</l>
     <l n="249">A Star , not seen before , in heaven appearing ,</l>
     <l n="250">Guided the Wise Men thither from the East , 250</l>
     <l n="251">To honour thee with incense , myrrh , and gold ;</l>
     <l n="252">By whose bright course led on they found the place ,</l>
     <l n="253">Affirming it thy star , new-graven in heaven ,</l>
     <l n="254">By which they knew thee King of Israel born .</l>
     <l n="255">Just Simeon and prophetic Anna , warned</l>
     <l n="256">By vision , found thee in the Temple , and spake ,</l>
     <l n="257">Before the altar and the vested priest ,</l>
     <l n="258">Like things of thee to all that present stood . ’</l>
     <l n="259">This having heart , straight I again revolved</l>
     <l n="260">The Law and Prophets , searching what was writ 260</l>
     <l n="261">Concerning the Messiah , to our scribes</l>
     <l n="262">Known partly , and soon found of whom they spake</l>
     <l n="263">I am — this chiefly , that my way must lie</l>
     <l n="264">Through many a hard assay , even to the death ,</l>
     <l n="265">Ere I the promised kingdom can attain ,</l>
     <l n="266">Or work redemption for mankind , whose sins ’</l>
     <l n="267">Full weight must be transferred upon my head .</l>
     <l n="268">Yet , neither thus disheartened or dismayed ,</l>
     <l n="269">The time prefixed I waited ; when behold</l>
     <l n="270">The Baptist ( of whose birth I oft had heard , 270</l>
     <l n="271">Not knew by sight ) now come , who was to come</l>
     <l n="272">Before Messiah , and his way prepare !</l>
     <l n="273">I , as all others , to his baptism came ,</l>
     <l n="274">Which I believed was from above ; but he</l>
     <l n="275">Straight knew me , and with loudest voice proclaimed</l>
     <l n="276">Me him ( for it was shewn him so from Heaven ) —</l>
     <l n="277">Me him whose harbinger he was ; and first</l>
     <l n="278">Refused on me his baptism to confer ,</l>
     <l n="279">As much his greater , and was hardly won .</l>
     <l n="280">But , as I rose out of the laving stream , 280</l>
     <l n="281">Heaven opened her eternal doors , from whence</l>
     <l n="282">The Spirit descended on me like a Dove ;</l>
     <l n="283">And last , the sum of all , my Father 's voice ,</l>
     <l n="284">Audibly heard from Heaven , pronounced me his ,</l>
     <l n="285">Me his beloved Son , in whom alone</l>
     <l n="286">He was well pleased : by which I knew the time</l>
     <l n="287">Now full , that I no more should live obscure ,</l>
     <l n="288">But openly begin , as best becomes</l>
     <l n="289">The authority which I derived from Heaven .</l>
     <l n="290">And now by some strong motion I am led 290</l>
     <l n="291">Into this wilderness ; to what intent</l>
     <l n="292">I learn not yet . Perhaps I need not know ;</l>
     <l n="293">For what concerns my knowledge God reveals . ”</l>
     <l n="294">So spake our Morning Star , then in his rise ,</l>
     <l n="295">And , looking round , on every side beheld</l>
     <l n="296">A pathless desert , dusk with horrid shades .</l>
     <l n="297">The way he came , not having marked return ,</l>
     <l n="298">Was difficult , by human steps untrod ;</l>
     <l n="299">And he still on was led , but with such thoughts</l>
     <l n="300">Accompanied of things past and to come 300</l>
     <l n="301">Lodged in his breast as well might recommend</l>
     <l n="302">Such solitude before choicest society .</l>
     <l n="303">Full forty days he passed — whether on hill</l>
     <l n="304">Sometimes , anon in shady vale , each night</l>
     <l n="305">Under the covert of some ancient oak</l>
     <l n="306">Or cedar to defend him from the dew ,</l>
     <l n="307">Or harboured in one cave , is not revealed ;</l>
     <l n="308">Nor tasted human food , nor hunger felt ,</l>
     <l n="309">Till those days ended ; hungered then at last</l>
     <l n="310">Among wild beasts . They at his sight grew mild , 310</l>
     <l n="311">Nor sleeping him nor waking harmed ; his walk</l>
     <l n="312">The fiery serpent fled and noxious worm ;</l>
     <l n="313">The lion and fierce tiger glared aloof .</l>
     <l n="314">But now an aged man in rural weeds ,</l>
     <l n="315">Following , as seemed , the quest of some stray eye ,</l>
     <l n="316">Or withered sticks to gather , which might serve</l>
     <l n="317">Against a winter 's day , when winds blow keen ,</l>
     <l n="318">To warm him wet returned from field at eve ,</l>
     <l n="319">He saw approach ; who first with curious eye</l>
     <l n="320">Perused him , then with words thus uttered spake :— 320</l>
     <l n="321">“ Sir , what ill chance hath brought thee to this place ,</l>
     <l n="322">So far from path or road of men , who pass</l>
     <l n="323">In troop or caravan ? for single none</l>
     <l n="324">Durst ever , who returned , and dropt not here</l>
     <l n="325">His carcass , pined with hunger and with droughth .</l>
     <l n="326">I ask the rather , and the more admire ,</l>
     <l n="327">For that to me thou seem'st the man whom late</l>
     <l n="328">Our new baptizing Prophet at the ford</l>
     <l n="329">Of Jordan honoured so , and called thee Son</l>
     <l n="330">Of God . I saw and heard , for we sometimes 330</l>
     <l n="331">Who dwell this wild , constrained by want , come forth</l>
     <l n="332">To town or village nigh ( nighest is far ) ,</l>
     <l n="333">Where aught we hear , and curious are to hear ,</l>
     <l n="334">What happens new ; fame also finds us out . ”</l>
     <l n="335">To whom the Son of God :— “ Who brought me hither</l>
     <l n="336">Will bring me hence ; no other guide I seek . ”</l>
     <l n="337">“ By miracle he may , ” replied the swain ;</l>
     <l n="338">“ What other way I see not ; for we here</l>
     <l n="339">Live on tough roots and stubs , to thirst inured</l>
     <l n="340">More than the camel , and to drink go far — 340</l>
     <l n="341">Men to much misery and hardship born .</l>
     <l n="342">But , if thou be the Son of God , command</l>
     <l n="343">That out of these hard stones be made thee bread ;</l>
     <l n="344">So shalt thou save thyself , and us relieve</l>
     <l n="345">With food , whereof we wretched seldom taste . ”</l>
     <l n="346">He ended , and the Son of God replied :—</l>
     <l n="347">“ Think'st thou such force in bread ? Is it not written</l>
     <l n="348">( For I discern thee other than thou seem'st ) ,</l>
     <l n="349">Man lives not by bread only , but each word</l>
     <l n="350">Proceeding from the mouth of God , who fed 350</l>
     <l n="351">Our fathers here with manna ? In the Mount</l>
     <l n="352">Moses was forty days , nor eat nor drank ;</l>
     <l n="353">And forty days Eliah without food</l>
     <l n="354">Wandered this barren waste ; the same I now .</l>
     <l n="355">Why dost thou , then , suggest to me distrust</l>
     <l n="356">Knowing who I am , as I know who thou art ? ”</l>
     <l n="357">Whom thus answered the Arch-Fiend , now undisguised :—</l>
     <l n="358">“ ‘ Tis true , I am that Spirit unfortunate</l>
     <l n="359">Who , leagued with millions more in rash revolt ,</l>
     <l n="360">Kept not my happy station , but was driven 360</l>
     <l n="361">With them from bliss to the bottomless Deep —</l>
     <l n="362">Yet to that hideous place not so confined</l>
     <l n="363">By rigour unconniving but that oft ,</l>
     <l n="364">Leaving my dolorous prison , I enjoy</l>
     <l n="365">Large liberty to round this globe of Earth ,</l>
     <l n="366">Or range in the Air ; nor from the Heaven of Heavens</l>
     <l n="367">Hath he excluded my resort sometimes .</l>
     <l n="368">I came , among the Sons of God , when he</l>
     <l n="369">Gave up into my hands Uzzean Job ,</l>
     <l n="370">To prove him , and illustrate his high worth ; 370</l>
     <l n="371">And , when to all his Angels he proposed</l>
     <l n="372">To draw the proud king Ahab into fraud ,</l>
     <l n="373">That he might fall in Ramoth , they demurring ,</l>
     <l n="374">I undertook that office , and the tongues</l>
     <l n="375">Of all his flattering prophets glibbed with lies</l>
     <l n="376">To his destruction , as I had in charge :</l>
     <l n="377">For what he bids I do . Though I have lost</l>
     <l n="378">Much lustre of my native brightness , lost</l>
     <l n="379">To be beloved of God , I have not lost</l>
     <l n="380">To love , at least contemplate and admire , 380</l>
     <l n="381">What I see excellent in good , or fair ,</l>
     <l n="382">Or virtuous ; I should so have lost all sense .</l>
     <l n="383">What can be then less in me than desire</l>
     <l n="384">To see thee and approach thee , whom I know</l>
     <l n="385">Declared the Son of God , to hear attent</l>
     <l n="386">Thy wisdom , and behold thy godlike deeds ?</l>
     <l n="387">Men generally think me much a foe</l>
     <l n="388">To all mankind . Why should I ? they to me</l>
     <l n="389">Never did wrong or violence . By them</l>
     <l n="390">I lost not what I lost ; rather by them 390</l>
     <l n="391">I gained what I have gained , and with them dwell</l>
     <l n="392">Copartner in these regions of the World ,</l>
     <l n="393">If not disposer — lend them oft my aid ,</l>
     <l n="394">Oft my advice by presages and signs ,</l>
     <l n="395">And answers , oracles , portents , and dreams ,</l>
     <l n="396">Whereby they may direct their future life .</l>
     <l n="397">Envy , they say , excites me , thus to gain</l>
     <l n="398">Companions of my misery and woe !</l>
     <l n="399">At first it may be ; but , long since with woe</l>
     <l n="400">Nearer acquainted , now I feel by proof 400</l>
     <l n="401">That fellowship in pain divides not smart ,</l>
     <l n="402">Nor lightens aught each man 's peculiar load ;</l>
     <l n="403">Small consolation , then , were Man adjoined .</l>
     <l n="404">This wounds me most ( what can it less ? ) that Man ,</l>
     <l n="405">Man fallen , shall be restored , I never more . ”</l>
     <l n="406">To whom our Saviour sternly thus replied :—</l>
     <l n="407">“ Deservedly thou griev'st , composed of lies</l>
     <l n="408">From the beginning , and in lies wilt end ,</l>
     <l n="409">Who boast'st release from Hell , and leave to come</l>
     <l n="410">Into the Heaven of Heavens . Thou com'st , indeed , 410</l>
     <l n="411">As a poor miserable captive thrall</l>
     <l n="412">Comes to the place where he before had sat</l>
     <l n="413">Among the prime in splendour , now deposed ,</l>
     <l n="414">Ejected , emptied , gazed , unpitied , shunned ,</l>
     <l n="415">A spectacle of ruin , or of scorn ,</l>
     <l n="416">To all the host of Heaven . The happy place</l>
     <l n="417">Imparts to thee no happiness , no joy —</l>
     <l n="418">Rather inflames thy torment , representing</l>
     <l n="419">Lost bliss , to thee no more communicable ;</l>
     <l n="420">So never more in Hell than when in Heaven . 420</l>
     <l n="421">But thou art serviceable to Heaven 's King !</l>
     <l n="422">Wilt thou impute to obedience what thy fear</l>
     <l n="423">Extorts , or pleasure to do ill excites ?</l>
     <l n="424">What but thy malice moved thee to misdeem</l>
     <l n="425">Of righteous Job , then cruelly to afflict him</l>
     <l n="426">With all inflictions ? but his patience won .</l>
     <l n="427">The other service was thy chosen task ,</l>
     <l n="428">To be a liar in four hundred mouths ;</l>
     <l n="429">For lying is thy sustenance , thy food .</l>
     <l n="430">Yet thou pretend'st to truth ! all oracles 430</l>
     <l n="431">By thee are given , and what confessed more true</l>
     <l n="432">Among the nations ? That hath been thy craft ,</l>
     <l n="433">By mixing somewhat true to vent more lies .</l>
     <l n="434">But what have been thy answers ? what but dark ,</l>
     <l n="435">Ambiguous , and with double sense deluding ,</l>
     <l n="436">Which they who asked have seldom understood ,</l>
     <l n="437">And , not well understood , as good not known ?</l>
     <l n="438">Who ever , by consulting at thy shrine ,</l>
     <l n="439">Returned the wiser , or the more instruct</l>
     <l n="440">To fly or follow what concerned him most , 440</l>
     <l n="441">And run not sooner to his fatal snare ?</l>
     <l n="442">For God hath justly given the nations up</l>
     <l n="443">To thy delusions ; justly , since they fell</l>
     <l n="444">Idolatrous . But , when his purpose is</l>
     <l n="445">Among them to declare his providence ,</l>
     <l n="446">To thee not known , whence hast thou then thy truth ,</l>
     <l n="447">But from him , or his Angels president</l>
     <l n="448">In every province , who , themselves disdaining</l>
     <l n="449">To approach thy temples , give thee in command</l>
     <l n="450">What , to the smallest tittle , thou shalt say 450</l>
     <l n="451">To thy adorers ? Thou , with trembling fear ,</l>
     <l n="452">Or like a fawning parasite , obey'st ;</l>
     <l n="453">Then to thyself ascrib'st the truth foretold .</l>
     <l n="454">But this thy glory shall be soon retrenched ;</l>
     <l n="455">No more shalt thou by oracling abuse</l>
     <l n="456">The Gentiles ; henceforth oracles are ceased ,</l>
     <l n="457">And thou no more with pomp and sacrifice</l>
     <l n="458">Shalt be enquired at Delphos or elsewhere —</l>
     <l n="459">At least in vain , for they shall find thee mute .</l>
     <l n="460">God hath now sent his living Oracle 460</l>
     <l n="461">Into the world to teach his final will ,</l>
     <l n="462">And sends his Spirit of Truth henceforth to dwell</l>
     <l n="463">In pious hearts , an inward oracle</l>
     <l n="464">To all truth requisite for men to know . ”</l>
     <l n="465">So spake our Saviour ; but the subtle Fiend ,</l>
     <l n="466">Though inly stung with anger and disdain ,</l>
     <l n="467">Dissembled , and this answer smooth returned :—</l>
     <l n="468">“ Sharply thou hast insisted on rebuke ,</l>
     <l n="469">And urged me hard with doings which not will ,</l>
     <l n="470">But misery , hath wrested from me . Where 470</l>
     <l n="471">Easily canst thou find one miserable ,</l>
     <l n="472">And not inforced oft-times to part from truth ,</l>
     <l n="473">If it may stand him more in stead to lie ,</l>
     <l n="474">Say and unsay , feign , flatter , or abjure ?</l>
     <l n="475">But thou art placed above me ; thou art Lord ;</l>
     <l n="476">From thee I can , and must , submiss , endure</l>
     <l n="477">Cheek or reproof , and glad to scape so quit .</l>
     <l n="478">Hard are the ways of truth , and rough to walk ,</l>
     <l n="479">Smooth on the tongue discoursed , pleasing to the ear ,</l>
     <l n="480">And tunable as sylvan pipe or song ; 480</l>
     <l n="481">What wonder , then , if I delight to hear</l>
     <l n="482">Her dictates from thy mouth ? most men admire</l>
     <l n="483">Virtue who follow not her lore . Permit me</l>
     <l n="484">To hear thee when I come ( since no man comes ) ,</l>
     <l n="485">And talk at least , though I despair to attain .</l>
     <l n="486">Thy Father , who is holy , wise , and pure ,</l>
     <l n="487">Suffers the hypocrite or atheous priest</l>
     <l n="488">To tread his sacred courts , and minister</l>
     <l n="489">About his altar , handling holy things ,</l>
     <l n="490">Praying or vowing , and voutsafed his voice 490</l>
     <l n="491">To Balaam reprobate , a prophet yet</l>
     <l n="492">Inspired : disdain not such access to me . ”</l>
     <l n="493">To whom our Saviour , with unaltered brow :—</l>
     <l n="494">“ Thy coming hither , though I know thy scope ,</l>
     <l n="495">I bid not , or forbid . Do as thou find'st</l>
     <l n="496">Permission from above ; thou canst not more . ”</l>
     <l n="497">He added not ; and Satan , bowling low</l>
     <l n="498">His gray dissimulation , disappeared ,</l>
     <l n="499">Into thin air diffused : for now began</l>
     <l n="500">Night with her sullen wing to double-shade 500</l>
     <l n="501">The desert ; fowls in their clay nests were couched ;</l>
     <l n="502">And now wild beasts came forth the woods to roam .</l>

    <head>THE SECOND BOOK</head>
     <l n="1">MEANWHILE the new-baptized , who yet remained</l>
     <l n="2">At Jordan with the Baptist , and had seen</l>
     <l n="3">Him whom they heard so late expressly called</l>
     <l n="4">Jesus Messiah , Son of God , declared ,</l>
     <l n="5">And on that high authority had believed ,</l>
     <l n="6">And with him talked , and with him lodged — I mean</l>
     <l n="7">Andrew and Simon , famous after known ,</l>
     <l n="8">With others , though in Holy Writ not named —</l>
     <l n="9">Now missing him , their joy so lately found ,</l>
     <l n="10">So lately found and so abruptly gone , 10</l>
     <l n="11">Began to doubt , and doubted many days ,</l>
     <l n="12">And , as the days increased , increased their doubt .</l>
     <l n="13">Sometimes they thought he might be only shewn ,</l>
     <l n="14">And for a time caught up to God , as once</l>
     <l n="15">Moses was in the Mount and missing long ,</l>
     <l n="16">And the great Thisbite , who on fiery wheels</l>
     <l n="17">Rode up to Heaven , yet once again to come .</l>
     <l n="18">Therefore , as those young prophets then with care</l>
     <l n="19">Sought lost Eliah , so in each place these</l>
     <l n="20">Nigh to Bethabara — in Jericho 20</l>
     <l n="21">The city of palms , AEnon , and Salem old ,</l>
     <l n="22">Machaerus , and each town or city walled</l>
     <l n="23">On this side the broad lake Genezaret ,</l>
     <l n="24">Or in Peraea — but returned in vain .</l>
     <l n="25">Then on the bank of Jordan , by a creek ,</l>
     <l n="26">Where winds with reeds and osiers whispering play ,</l>
     <l n="27">Plain fishermen ( no greater men them call ) ,</l>
     <l n="28">Close in a cottage low together got ,</l>
     <l n="29">Their unexpected loss and plaints outbreathed :—</l>
     <l n="30">“ Alas , from what high hope to what relapse 30</l>
     <l n="31">Unlooked for are we fallen ! Our eyes beheld</l>
     <l n="32">Messiah certainly now come , so long</l>
     <l n="33">Expected of our fathers ; we have heard</l>
     <l n="34">His words , his wisdom full of grace and truth .</l>
     <l n="35">‘ Now , now , for sure , deliverance is at hand ;</l>
     <l n="36">The kingdom shall to Israel be restored : ’</l>
     <l n="37">Thus we rejoiced , but soon our joy is turned</l>
     <l n="38">Into perplexity and new amaze .</l>
     <l n="39">For whither is he gone ? what accident</l>
     <l n="40">Hath rapt him from us ? will he now retire 40</l>
     <l n="41">After appearance , and again prolong</l>
     <l n="42">Our expectation ? God of Israel ,</l>
     <l n="43">Send thy Messiah forth ; the time is come .</l>
     <l n="44">Behold the kings of the earth , how they oppress</l>
     <l n="45">Thy Chosen , to what highth their power unjust</l>
     <l n="46">They have exalted , and behind them cast</l>
     <l n="47">All fear of Thee ; arise , and vindicate</l>
     <l n="48">Thy glory ; free thy people from their yoke !</l>
     <l n="49">But let us wait ; thus far He hath performed —</l>
     <l n="50">Sent his Anointed , and to us revealed him 50</l>
     <l n="51">By his great Prophet pointed at and shown</l>
     <l n="52">In public , and with him we have conversed .</l>
     <l n="53">Let us be glad of this , and all our fears</l>
     <l n="54">Lay on his providence ; He will not fail ,</l>
     <l n="55">Nor will withdraw him now , nor will recall —</l>
     <l n="56">Mock us with his blest sight , then snatch him hence :</l>
     <l n="57">Soon we shall see our hope , our joy , return . ”</l>
     <l n="58">Thus they out of their plaints new hope resume</l>
     <l n="59">To find whom at the first they found unsought .</l>
     <l n="60">But to his mother Mary , when she saw 60</l>
     <l n="61">Others returned from baptism , not her Son ,</l>
     <l n="62">Nor left at Jordan tidings of him none ,</l>
     <l n="63">Within her breast though calm , her breast though pure ,</l>
     <l n="64">Motherly cares and fears got head , and raised</l>
     <l n="65">Some troubled thoughts , which she in sighs thus clad :—</l>
     <l n="66">“ Oh , what avails me now that honour high ,</l>
     <l n="67">To have conceived of God , or that salute ,</l>
     <l n="68">‘ Hail , highly favoured , among women blest ! ’</l>
     <l n="69">While I to sorrows am no less advanced ,</l>
     <l n="70">And fears as eminent above the lot 70</l>
     <l n="71">Of other women , by the birth I bore :</l>
     <l n="72">In such a season born , when scarce a shed</l>
     <l n="73">Could be obtained to shelter him or me</l>
     <l n="74">From the bleak air ? A stable was our warmth ,</l>
     <l n="75">A manger his ; yet soon enforced to fly</l>
     <l n="76">Thence into Egypt , till the murderous king</l>
     <l n="77">Were dead , who sought his life , and , missing , filled</l>
     <l n="78">With infant blood the streets of Bethlehem .</l>
     <l n="79">From Egypt home returned , in Nazareth</l>
     <l n="80">Hath been our dwelling many years ; his life 80</l>
     <l n="81">Private , unactive , calm , contemplative ,</l>
     <l n="82">Little suspicious to any king . But now ,</l>
     <l n="83">Full grown to man , acknowledged , as I hear ,</l>
     <l n="84">By John the Baptist , and in public shewn ,</l>
     <l n="85">Son owned from Heaven by his Father 's voice ,</l>
     <l n="86">I looked for some great change . To honour ? no ;</l>
     <l n="87">But trouble , as old Simeon plain foretold ,</l>
     <l n="88">That to the fall and rising he should be</l>
     <l n="89">Of many in Israel , and to a sign</l>
     <l n="90">Spoken against — that through my very soul 90</l>
     <l n="91">A sword shall pierce . This is my favoured lot ,</l>
     <l n="92">My exaltation to afflictions high !</l>
     <l n="93">Afflicted I may be , it seems , and blest !</l>
     <l n="94">I will not argue that , nor will repine .</l>
     <l n="95">But where delays he now ? Some great intent</l>
     <l n="96">Conceals him . When twelve years he scarce had seen ,</l>
     <l n="97">I lost him , but so found as well I saw</l>
     <l n="98">He could not lose himself , but went about</l>
     <l n="99">His Father 's business . What he meant I mused —</l>
     <l n="100">Since understand ; much more his absence now 100</l>
     <l n="101">Thus long to some great purpose he obscures .</l>
     <l n="102">But I to wait with patience am inured ;</l>
     <l n="103">My heart hath been a storehouse long of things</l>
     <l n="104">And sayings laid up , pretending strange events . ”</l>
     <l n="105">Thus Mary , pondering oft , and oft to mind</l>
     <l n="106">Recalling what remarkably had passed</l>
     <l n="107">Since first her Salutation heard , with thoughts</l>
     <l n="108">Meekly composed awaited the fulfilling :</l>
     <l n="109">The while her Son , tracing the desert wild ,</l>
     <l n="110">Sole , but with holiest meditations fed , 110</l>
     <l n="111">Into himself descended , and at once</l>
     <l n="112">All his great work to come before him set —</l>
     <l n="113">How to begin , how to accomplish best</l>
     <l n="114">His end of being on Earth , and mission high .</l>
     <l n="115">For Satan , with sly preface to return ,</l>
     <l n="116">Had left him vacant , and with speed was gone</l>
     <l n="117">Up to the middle region of thick air ,</l>
     <l n="118">Where all his Potentates in council sate .</l>
     <l n="119">There , without sign of boast , or sign of joy ,</l>
     <l n="120">Solicitous and blank , he thus began :— 120</l>
     <l n="121">“ Princes , Heaven 's ancient Sons , AEthereal Thrones —</l>
     <l n="122">Daemonian Spirits now , from the element</l>
     <l n="123">Each of his reign allotted , rightlier called</l>
     <l n="124">Powers of Fire , Air , Water , and Earth beneath</l>
     <l n="125">( So may we hold our place and these mild seats</l>
     <l n="126">Without new trouble ! ) — such an enemy</l>
     <l n="127">Is risen to invade us , who no less</l>
     <l n="128">Threatens than our expulsion down to Hell .</l>
     <l n="129">I , as I undertook , and with the vote</l>
     <l n="130">Consenting in full frequence was impowered , 130</l>
     <l n="131">Have found him , viewed him , tasted him ; but find</l>
     <l n="132">Far other labour to be undergone</l>
     <l n="133">Than when I dealt with Adam , first of men ,</l>
     <l n="134">Though Adam by his wife 's allurement fell ,</l>
     <l n="135">However to this Man inferior far —</l>
     <l n="136">If he be Man by mother 's side , at least</l>
     <l n="137">With more than human gifts from Heaven adorned ,</l>
     <l n="138">Perfections absolute , graces divine ,</l>
     <l n="139">And amplitude of mind to greatest deeds .</l>
     <l n="140">Therefore I am returned , lest confidence 140</l>
     <l n="141">Of my success with Eve in Paradise</l>
     <l n="142">Deceive ye to persuasion over-sure</l>
     <l n="143">Of like succeeding here . I summon all</l>
     <l n="144">Rather to be in readiness with hand</l>
     <l n="145">Or counsel to assist , lest I , who erst</l>
     <l n="146">Thought none my equal , now be overmatched . ”</l>
     <l n="147">So spake the old Serpent , doubting , and from all</l>
     <l n="148">With clamour was assured their utmost aid</l>
     <l n="149">At his command ; when from amidst them rose</l>
     <l n="150">Belial , the dissolutest Spirit that fell , 150</l>
     <l n="151">The sensualest , and , after Asmodai ,</l>
     <l n="152">The fleshliest Incubus , and thus advised :—</l>
     <l n="153">“ Set women in his eye and in his walk ,</l>
     <l n="154">Among daughters of men the fairest found .</l>
     <l n="155">Many are in each region passing fair</l>
     <l n="156">As the noon sky , more like to goddesses</l>
     <l n="157">Than mortal creatures , graceful and discreet ,</l>
     <l n="158">Expert in amorous arts , enchanting tongues</l>
     <l n="159">Persuasive , virgin majesty with mild</l>
     <l n="160">And sweet allayed , yet terrible to approach , 160</l>
     <l n="161">Skilled to retire , and in retiring draw</l>
     <l n="162">Hearts after them tangled in amorous nets .</l>
     <l n="163">Such object hath the power to soften and tame</l>
     <l n="164">Severest temper , smooth the rugged'st brow ,</l>
     <l n="165">Enerve , and with voluptuous hope dissolve ,</l>
     <l n="166">Draw out with credulous desire , and lead</l>
     <l n="167">At will the manliest , resolutest breast ,</l>
     <l n="168">As the magnetic hardest iron draws .</l>
     <l n="169">Women , when nothing else , beguiled the heart</l>
     <l n="170">Of wisest Solomon , and made him build , 170</l>
     <l n="171">And made him bow , to the gods of his wives . ”</l>
     <l n="172">To whom quick answer Satan thus returned :—</l>
     <l n="173">“ Belial , in much uneven scale thou weigh'st</l>
     <l n="174">All others by thyself . Because of old</l>
     <l n="175">Thou thyself doat'st on womankind , admiring</l>
     <l n="176">Their shape , their colour , and attractive grace ,</l>
     <l n="177">None are , thou think'st , but taken with such toys .</l>
     <l n="178">Before the Flood , thou , with thy lusty crew ,</l>
     <l n="179">False titled Sons of God , roaming the Earth ,</l>
     <l n="180">Cast wanton eyes on the daughters of men , 180</l>
     <l n="181">And coupled with them , and begot a race .</l>
     <l n="182">Have we not seen , or by relation heard ,</l>
     <l n="183">In courts and regal chambers how thou lurk'st ,</l>
     <l n="184">In wood or grove , by mossy fountain-side ,</l>
     <l n="185">In valley or green meadow , to waylay</l>
     <l n="186">Some beauty rare , Calisto , Clymene ,</l>
     <l n="187">Daphne , or Semele , Antiopa ,</l>
     <l n="188">Or Amymone , Syrinx , many more</l>
     <l n="189">Too long — then lay'st thy scapes on names adored ,</l>
     <l n="190">Apollo , Neptune , Jupiter , or Pan , 190</l>
     <l n="191">Satyr , or Faun , or Silvan ? But these haunts</l>
     <l n="192">Delight not all . Among the sons of men</l>
     <l n="193">How many have with a smile made small account</l>
     <l n="194">Of beauty and her lures , easily scorned</l>
     <l n="195">All her assaults , on worthier things intent !</l>
     <l n="196">Remember that Pellean conqueror ,</l>
     <l n="197">A youth , how all the beauties of the East</l>
     <l n="198">He slightly viewed , and slightly overpassed ;</l>
     <l n="199">How he surnamed of Africa dismissed ,</l>
     <l n="200">In his prime youth , the fair Iberian maid . 200</l>
     <l n="201">For Solomon , he lived at ease , and , full</l>
     <l n="202">Of honour , wealth , high fare , aimed not beyond</l>
     <l n="203">Higher design than to enjoy his state ;</l>
     <l n="204">Thence to the bait of women lay exposed .</l>
     <l n="205">But he whom we attempt is wiser far</l>
     <l n="206">Than Solomon , of more exalted mind ,</l>
     <l n="207">Made and set wholly on the accomplishment</l>
     <l n="208">Of greatest things . What woman will you find ,</l>
     <l n="209">Though of this age the wonder and the fame ,</l>
     <l n="210">On whom his leisure will voutsafe an eye 210</l>
     <l n="211">Of fond desire ? Or should she , confident ,</l>
     <l n="212">As sitting queen adored on Beauty 's throne ,</l>
     <l n="213">Descend with all her winning charms begirt</l>
     <l n="214">To enamour , as the zone of Venus once</l>
     <l n="215">Wrought that effect on Jove ( so fables tell ) ,</l>
     <l n="216">How would one look from his majestic brow ,</l>
     <l n="217">Seated as on the top of Virtue 's hill ,</l>
     <l n="218">Discountenance her despised , and put to rout</l>
     <l n="219">All her array , her female pride deject ,</l>
     <l n="220">Or turn to reverent awe ! For Beauty stands 220</l>
     <l n="221">In the admiration only of weak minds</l>
     <l n="222">Led captive ; cease to admire , and all her plumes</l>
     <l n="223">Fall flat , and shrink into a trivial toy ,</l>
     <l n="224">At every sudden slighting quite abashed .</l>
     <l n="225">Therefore with manlier objects we must try</l>
     <l n="226">His constancy — with such as have more shew</l>
     <l n="227">Of worth , of honour , glory , and popular praise</l>
     <l n="228">( Rocks whereon greatest men have oftest wrecked ) ;</l>
     <l n="229">Or that which only seems to satisfy</l>
     <l n="230">Lawful desires of nature , not beyond . 230</l>
     <l n="231">And now I know he hungers , where no food</l>
     <l n="232">Is to be found , in the wide Wilderness :</l>
     <l n="233">The rest commit to me ; I shall let pass</l>
     <l n="234">No advantage , and his strength as oft assay . ”</l>
     <l n="235">He ceased , and heard their grant in loud acclaim ;</l>
     <l n="236">Then forthwith to him takes a chosen band</l>
     <l n="237">Of Spirits likest to himself in guile ,</l>
     <l n="238">To be at hand and at his beck appear ,</l>
     <l n="239">If cause were to unfold some active scene</l>
     <l n="240">Of various persons , each to know his part ; 240</l>
     <l n="241">Then to the desert takes with these his flight ,</l>
     <l n="242">Where still , from shade to shade , the Son of God ,</l>
     <l n="243">After forty days ’ fasting , had remained ,</l>
     <l n="244">Now hungering first , and to himself thus said :—</l>
     <l n="245">“ Where will this end ? Four times ten days I have passed</l>
     <l n="246">Wandering this woody maze , and human food</l>
     <l n="247">Nor tasted , nor had appetite . That fast</l>
     <l n="248">To virtue I impute not , or count part</l>
     <l n="249">Of what I suffer here . If nature need not ,</l>
     <l n="250">Or God support nature without repast , 250</l>
     <l n="251">Though needing , what praise is it to endure ?</l>
     <l n="252">But now I feel I hunger ; which declares</l>
     <l n="253">Nature hath need of what she asks . Yet God</l>
     <l n="254">Can satisfy that need some other way ,</l>
     <l n="255">Though hunger still remain . So it remain</l>
     <l n="256">Without this body 's wasting , I content me ,</l>
     <l n="257">And from the sting of famine fear no harm ;</l>
     <l n="258">Nor mind it , fed with better thoughts , that feed</l>
     <l n="259">Me hungering more to do my Father 's will . ”</l>
     <l n="260">It was the hour of night , when thus the Son 260</l>
     <l n="261">Communed in silent walk , then laid him down</l>
     <l n="262">Under the hospitable covert nigh</l>
     <l n="263">Of trees thick interwoven . There he slept ,</l>
     <l n="264">And dreamed , as appetite is wont to dream ,</l>
     <l n="265">Of meats and drinks , nature 's refreshment sweet .</l>
     <l n="266">Him thought he by the brook of Cherith stood ,</l>
     <l n="267">And saw the ravens with their horny beaks</l>
     <l n="268">Food to Elijah bringing even and morn —</l>
     <l n="269">Though ravenous , taught to abstain from what they brought ;</l>
     <l n="270">He saw the Prophet also , how he fled 270</l>
     <l n="271">Into the desert , and how there he slept</l>
     <l n="272">Under a juniper — then how , awaked ,</l>
     <l n="273">He found his supper on the coals prepared ,</l>
     <l n="274">And by the Angel was bid rise and eat ,</l>
     <l n="275">And eat the second time after repose ,</l>
     <l n="276">The strength whereof sufficed him forty days :</l>
     <l n="277">Sometimes that with Elijah he partook ,</l>
     <l n="278">Or as a guest with Daniel at his pulse .</l>
     <l n="279">Thus wore out night ; and now the harald Lark</l>
     <l n="280">Left his ground-nest , high towering to descry 280</l>
     <l n="281">The Morn 's approach , and greet her with his song .</l>
     <l n="282">As lightly from his grassy couch up rose</l>
     <l n="283">Our Saviour , and found all was but a dream ;</l>
     <l n="284">Fasting he went to sleep , and fasting waked .</l>
     <l n="285">Up to a hill anon his steps he reared ,</l>
     <l n="286">From whose high top to ken the prospect round ,</l>
     <l n="287">If cottage were in view , sheep-cote , or herd ;</l>
     <l n="288">But cottage , herd , or sheep-cote , none he saw —</l>
     <l n="289">Only in a bottom saw a pleasant grove ,</l>
     <l n="290">With chaunt of tuneful birds resounding loud . 290</l>
     <l n="291">Thither he bent his way , determined there</l>
     <l n="292">To rest at noon , and entered soon the shade</l>
     <l n="293">High-roofed , and walks beneath , and alleys brown ,</l>
     <l n="294">That opened in the midst a woody scene ;</l>
     <l n="295">Nature 's own work it seemed ( Nature taught Art ) ,</l>
     <l n="296">And , to a superstitious eye , the haunt</l>
     <l n="297">Of wood-gods and wood-nymphs . He viewed it round ;</l>
     <l n="298">When suddenly a man before him stood ,</l>
     <l n="299">Not rustic as before , but seemlier clad ,</l>
     <l n="300">As one in city or court or palace bred , 300</l>
     <l n="301">And with fair speech these words to him addressed :—</l>
     <l n="302">“ With granted leave officious I return ,</l>
     <l n="303">But much more wonder that the Son of God</l>
     <l n="304">In this wild solitude so long should bide ,</l>
     <l n="305">Of all things destitute , and , well I know ,</l>
     <l n="306">Not without hunger . Others of some note ,</l>
     <l n="307">As story tells , have trod this wilderness :</l>
     <l n="308">The fugitive Bond-woman , with her son ,</l>
     <l n="309">Outcast Nebaioth , yet found here relief</l>
     <l n="310">By a providing Angel ; all the race 310</l>
     <l n="311">Of Israel here had famished , had not God</l>
     <l n="312">Rained from heaven manna ; and that Prophet bold ,</l>
     <l n="313">Native of Thebez , wandering here , was fed</l>
     <l n="314">Twice by a voice inviting him to eat .</l>
     <l n="315">Of thee those forty days none hath regard ,</l>
     <l n="316">Forty and more deserted here indeed . ”</l>
     <l n="317">To whom thus Jesus :— “ What conclud'st thou hence ?</l>
     <l n="318">They all had need ; I , as thou seest , have none . ”</l>
     <l n="319">“ How hast thou hunger then ? ” Satan replied .</l>
     <l n="320">“ Tell me , if food were now before thee set , 320</l>
     <l n="321">Wouldst thou not eat ? ” “ Thereafter as I like</l>
     <l n="322">the giver , ” answered Jesus . “ Why should that</l>
     <l n="323">Cause thy refusal ? ” said the subtle Fiend .</l>
     <l n="324">“ Hast thou not right to all created things ?</l>
     <l n="325">Owe not all creatures , by just right , to thee</l>
     <l n="326">Duty and service , nor to stay till bid ,</l>
     <l n="327">But tender all their power ? Nor mention I</l>
     <l n="328">Meats by the law unclean , or offered first</l>
     <l n="329">To idols — those young Daniel could refuse ;</l>
     <l n="330">Nor proffered by an enemy — though who 330</l>
     <l n="331">Would scruple that , with want oppressed ? Behold ,</l>
     <l n="332">Nature ashamed , or , better to express ,</l>
     <l n="333">Troubled , that thou shouldst hunger , hath purveyed</l>
     <l n="334">From all the elements her choicest store ,</l>
     <l n="335">To treat thee as beseems , and as her Lord</l>
     <l n="336">With honour . Only deign to sit and eat . ”</l>
     <l n="337">He spake no dream ; for , as his words had end ,</l>
     <l n="338">Our Saviour , lifting up his eyes , beheld ,</l>
     <l n="339">In ample space under the broadest shade ,</l>
     <l n="340">A table richly spread in regal mode , 340</l>
     <l n="341">With dishes piled and meats of noblest sort</l>
     <l n="342">And savour — beasts of chase , or fowl of game ,</l>
     <l n="343">In pastry built , or from the spit , or boiled ,</l>
     <l n="344">Grisamber-steamed ; all fish , from sea or shore ,</l>
     <l n="345">Freshet or purling brook , of shell or fin ,</l>
     <l n="346">And exquisitest name , for which was drained</l>
     <l n="347">Pontus , and Lucrine bay , and Afric coast .</l>
     <l n="348">Alas ! how simple , to these cates compared ,</l>
     <l n="349">Was that crude Apple that diverted Eve !</l>
     <l n="350">And at a stately sideboard , by the wine , 350</l>
     <l n="351">That fragrant smell diffused , in order stood</l>
     <l n="352">Tall stripling youths rich-clad , of fairer hue</l>
     <l n="353">Than Ganymed or Hylas ; distant more ,</l>
     <l n="354">Under the trees now tripped , now solemn stood ,</l>
     <l n="355">Nymphs of Diana 's train , and Naiades</l>
     <l n="356">With fruits and flowers from Amalthea 's horn ,</l>
     <l n="357">And ladies of the Hesperides , that seemed</l>
     <l n="358">Fairer than feigned of old , or fabled since</l>
     <l n="359">Of faery damsels met in forest wide</l>
     <l n="360">By knights of Logres , or of Lyones , 360</l>
     <l n="361">Lancelot , or Pelleas , or Pellenore .</l>
     <l n="362">And all the while harmonious airs were heard</l>
     <l n="363">Of chiming strings or charming pipes ; and winds</l>
     <l n="364">Of gentlest gale Arabian odours fanned</l>
     <l n="365">From their soft wings , and Flora 's earliest smells .</l>
     <l n="366">Such was the splendour ; and the Tempter now</l>
     <l n="367">His invitation earnestly renewed :—</l>
     <l n="368">“ What doubts the Son of God to sit and eat ?</l>
     <l n="369">These are not fruits forbidden ; no interdict</l>
     <l n="370">Defends the touching of these viands pure ; 370</l>
     <l n="371">Their taste no knowledge works , at least of evil ,</l>
     <l n="372">But life preserves , destroys life 's enemy ,</l>
     <l n="373">Hunger , with sweet restorative delight .</l>
     <l n="374">All these are Spirits of air , and woods , and springs ,</l>
     <l n="375">Thy gentle ministers , who come to pay</l>
     <l n="376">Thee homage , and acknowledge thee their Lord .</l>
     <l n="377">What doubt'st thou , Son of God ? Sit down and eat . ”</l>
     <l n="378">To whom thus Jesus temperately replied :—</l>
     <l n="379">“ Said'st thou not that to all things I had right ?</l>
     <l n="380">And who withholds my power that right to use ? 380</l>
     <l n="381">Shall I receive by gift what of my own ,</l>
     <l n="382">When and where likes me best , I can command ?</l>
     <l n="383">I can at will , doubt not , as soon as thou ,</l>
     <l n="384">Command a table in this wilderness ,</l>
     <l n="385">And call swift flights of Angels ministrant ,</l>
     <l n="386">Arrayed in glory , on my cup to attend :</l>
     <l n="387">Why shouldst thou , then , obtrude this diligence</l>
     <l n="388">In vain , where no acceptance it can find ?</l>
     <l n="389">And with my hunger what hast thou to do ?</l>
     <l n="390">Thy pompous delicacies I contemn , 390</l>
     <l n="391">And count thy specious gifts no gifts , but guiles . ”</l>
     <l n="392">To whom thus answered Satan , male-content :—</l>
     <l n="393">“ That I have also power to give thou seest ;</l>
     <l n="394">If of that power I bring thee voluntary</l>
     <l n="395">What I might have bestowed on whom I pleased ,</l>
     <l n="396">And rather opportunely in this place</l>
     <l n="397">Chose to impart to thy apparent need ,</l>
     <l n="398">Why shouldst thou not accept it ? But I see</l>
     <l n="399">What I can do or offer is suspect .</l>
     <l n="400">Of these things others quickly will dispose , 400</l>
     <l n="401">Whose pains have earned the far-fet spoil . ” With that</l>
     <l n="402">Both table and provision vanished quite ,</l>
     <l n="403">With sound of harpies ’ wings and talons heard ;</l>
     <l n="404">Only the importune Tempter still remained ,</l>
     <l n="405">And with these words his temptation pursued :—</l>
     <l n="406">“ By hunger , that each other creature tames ,</l>
     <l n="407">Thou art not to be harmed , therefore not moved ;</l>
     <l n="408">Thy temperance , invincible besides ,</l>
     <l n="409">For no allurement yields to appetite ;</l>
     <l n="410">And all thy heart is set on high designs , 410</l>
     <l n="411">High actions . But wherewith to be achieved ?</l>
     <l n="412">Great acts require great means of enterprise ;</l>
     <l n="413">Thou art unknown , unfriended , low of birth ,</l>
     <l n="414">A carpenter thy father known , thyself</l>
     <l n="415">Bred up in poverty and straits at home ,</l>
     <l n="416">Lost in a desert here and hunger-bit .</l>
     <l n="417">Which way , or from what hope , dost thou aspire</l>
     <l n="418">To greatness ? whence authority deriv'st ?</l>
     <l n="419">What followers , what retinue canst thou gain ,</l>
     <l n="420">Or at thy heels the dizzy multitude , 420</l>
     <l n="421">Longer than thou canst feed them on thy cost ?</l>
     <l n="422">Money brings honour , friends , conquest , and realms .</l>
     <l n="423">What raised Antipater the Edomite ,</l>
     <l n="424">And his son Herod placed on Juda 's throne ,</l>
     <l n="425">Thy throne , but gold , that got him puissant friends ?</l>
     <l n="426">Therefore , if at great things thou wouldst arrive ,</l>
     <l n="427">Get riches first , get wealth , and treasure heap —</l>
     <l n="428">Not difficult , if thou hearken to me .</l>
     <l n="429">Riches are mine , fortune is in my hand ;</l>
     <l n="430">They whom I favour thrive in wealth amain , 430</l>
     <l n="431">While virtue , valour , wisdom , sit in want . ”</l>
     <l n="432">To whom thus Jesus patiently replied :—</l>
     <l n="433">“ Yet wealth without these three is impotent</l>
     <l n="434">To gain dominion , or to keep it gained —</l>
     <l n="435">Witness those ancient empires of the earth ,</l>
     <l n="436">In highth of all their flowing wealth dissolved ;</l>
     <l n="437">But men endued with these have oft attained ,</l>
     <l n="438">In lowest poverty , to highest deeds —</l>
     <l n="439">Gideon , and Jephtha , and the shepherd lad</l>
     <l n="440">Whose offspring on the throne of Juda sate 440</l>
     <l n="441">So many ages , and shall yet regain</l>
     <l n="442">That seat , and reign in Israel without end .</l>
     <l n="443">Among the Heathen ( for throughout the world</l>
     <l n="444">To me is not unknown what hath been done</l>
     <l n="445">Worthy of memorial ) canst thou not remember</l>
     <l n="446">Quintius , Fabricius , Curius , Regulus ?</l>
     <l n="447">For I esteem those names of men so poor ,</l>
     <l n="448">Who could do mighty things , and could contemn</l>
     <l n="449">Riches , though offered from the hand of kings .</l>
     <l n="450">And what in me seems wanting but that I 450</l>
     <l n="451">May also in this poverty as soon</l>
     <l n="452">Accomplish what they did , perhaps and more ?</l>
     <l n="453">Extol not riches , then , the toil of fools ,</l>
     <l n="454">The wise man 's cumbrance , if not snare ; more apt</l>
     <l n="455">To slacken virtue and abate her edge</l>
     <l n="456">Than prompt her to do aught may merit praise .</l>
     <l n="457">What if with like aversion I reject</l>
     <l n="458">Riches and realms ! Yet not for that a crown ,</l>
     <l n="459">Golden in shew , is but a wreath of thorns ,</l>
     <l n="460">Brings dangers , troubles , cares , and sleepless nights , 460</l>
     <l n="461">To him who wears the regal diadem ,</l>
     <l n="462">When on his shoulders each man 's burden lies ;</l>
     <l n="463">For therein stands the office of a king ,</l>
     <l n="464">His honour , virtue , merit , and chief praise ,</l>
     <l n="465">That for the public all this weight he bears .</l>
     <l n="466">Yet he who reigns within himself , and rules</l>
     <l n="467">Passions , desires , and fears , is more a king —</l>
     <l n="468">Which every wise and virtuous man attains ;</l>
     <l n="469">And who attains not , ill aspires to rule</l>
     <l n="470">Cities of men , or headstrong multitudes , 470</l>
     <l n="471">Subject himself to anarchy within ,</l>
     <l n="472">Or lawless passions in him , which he serves .</l>
     <l n="473">But to guide nations in the way of truth</l>
     <l n="474">By saving doctrine , and from error lead</l>
     <l n="475">To know , and , knowing , worship God aright ,</l>
     <l n="476">Is yet more kingly . This attracts the soul ,</l>
     <l n="477">Governs the inner man , the nobler part ;</l>
     <l n="478">That other o'er the body only reigns ,</l>
     <l n="479">And oft by force — which to a generous mind</l>
     <l n="480">So reigning can be no sincere delight . 480</l>
     <l n="481">Besides , to give a kingdom hath been thought</l>
     <l n="482">Greater and nobler done , and to lay down</l>
     <l n="483">Far more magnanimous , than to assume .</l>
     <l n="484">Riches are needless , then , both for themselves ,</l>
     <l n="485">And for thy reason why they should be sought —</l>
     <l n="486">To gain a sceptre , oftest better missed . ”</l>

    <head>THE THIRD BOOK</head>
     <l n="1">SO spake the Son of God ; and Satan stood</l>
     <l n="2">A while as mute , confounded what to say ,</l>
     <l n="3">What to reply , confuted and convinced</l>
     <l n="4">Of his weak arguing and fallacious drift ;</l>
     <l n="5">At length , collecting all his serpent wiles ,</l>
     <l n="6">With soothing words renewed , him thus accosts :—</l>
     <l n="7">“ I see thou know'st what is of use to know ,</l>
     <l n="8">What best to say canst say , to do canst do ;</l>
     <l n="9">Thy actions to thy words accord ; thy words</l>
     <l n="10">To thy large heart give utterance due ; thy heart 10</l>
     <l n="11">Contains of good , wise , just , the perfet shape .</l>
     <l n="12">Should kings and nations from thy mouth consult ,</l>
     <l n="13">Thy counsel would be as the oracle</l>
     <l n="14">Urim and Thummim , those oraculous gems</l>
     <l n="15">On Aaron 's breast , or tongue of Seers old</l>
     <l n="16">Infallible ; or , wert thou sought to deeds</l>
     <l n="17">That might require the array of war , thy skill</l>
     <l n="18">Of conduct would be such that all the world</l>
     <l n="19">Could not sustain thy prowess , or subsist</l>
     <l n="20">In battle , though against thy few in arms . 20</l>
     <l n="21">These godlike virtues wherefore dost thou hide ?</l>
     <l n="22">Affecting private life , or more obscure</l>
     <l n="23">In savage wilderness , wherefore deprive</l>
     <l n="24">All Earth her wonder at thy acts , thyself</l>
     <l n="25">The fame and glory — glory , the reward</l>
     <l n="26">That sole excites to high attempts the flame</l>
     <l n="27">Of most erected spirits , most tempered pure</l>
     <l n="28">AEthereal , who all pleasures else despise ,</l>
     <l n="29">All treasures and all gain esteem as dross ,</l>
     <l n="30">And dignities and powers , all but the highest ? 30</l>
     <l n="31">Thy years are ripe , and over-ripe . The son</l>
     <l n="32">Of Macedonian Philip had ere these</l>
     <l n="33">Won Asia , and the throne of Cyrus held</l>
     <l n="34">At his dispose ; young Scipio had brought down</l>
     <l n="35">The Carthaginian pride ; young Pompey quelled</l>
     <l n="36">The Pontic king , and in triumph had rode .</l>
     <l n="37">Yet years , and to ripe years judgment mature ,</l>
     <l n="38">Quench not the thirst of glory , but augment .</l>
     <l n="39">Great Julius , whom now all the world admires ,</l>
     <l n="40">The more he grew in years , the more inflamed 40</l>
     <l n="41">With glory , wept that he had lived so long</l>
     <l n="42">Ingloroious . But thou yet art not too late . ”</l>
     <l n="43">To whom our Saviour calmly thus replied :—</l>
     <l n="44">“ Thou neither dost persuade me to seek wealth</l>
     <l n="45">For empire 's sake , nor empire to affect</l>
     <l n="46">For glory 's sake , by all thy argument .</l>
     <l n="47">For what is glory but the blaze of fame ,</l>
     <l n="48">The people 's praise , if always praise unmixed ?</l>
     <l n="49">And what the people but a herd confused ,</l>
     <l n="50">A miscellaneous rabble , who extol 50</l>
     <l n="51">Things vulgar , and , well weighed , scarce worth the praise ?</l>
     <l n="52">They praise and they admire they know not what ,</l>
     <l n="53">And know not whom , but as one leads the other ;</l>
     <l n="54">And what delight to be by such extolled ,</l>
     <l n="55">To live upon their tongues , and be their talk ?</l>
     <l n="56">Of whom to be dispraised were no small praise —</l>
     <l n="57">His lot who dares be singularly good .</l>
     <l n="58">The intelligent among them and the wise</l>
     <l n="59">Are few , and glory scarce of few is raised .</l>
     <l n="60">This is true glory and renown — when God , 60</l>
     <l n="61">Looking on the Earth , with approbation marks</l>
     <l n="62">The just man , and divulges him through Heaven</l>
     <l n="63">To all his Angels , who with true applause</l>
     <l n="64">Recount his praises . Thus he did to Job ,</l>
     <l n="65">When , to extend his fame through Heaven and Earth ,</l>
     <l n="66">As thou to thy reproach may'st well remember ,</l>
     <l n="67">He asked thee , ‘ Hast thou seen my servant Job ? ’</l>
     <l n="68">Famous he was in Heaven ; on Earth less known ,</l>
     <l n="69">Where glory is false glory , attributed</l>
     <l n="70">To things not glorious , men not worthy of fame . 70</l>
     <l n="71">They err who count it glorious to subdue</l>
     <l n="72">By conquest far and wide , to overrun</l>
     <l n="73">Large countries , and in field great battles win ,</l>
     <l n="74">Great cities by assault . What do these worthies</l>
     <l n="75">But rob and spoil , burn , slaughter , and enslave</l>
     <l n="76">Peaceable nations , neighbouring or remote ,</l>
     <l n="77">Made captive , yet deserving freedom more</l>
     <l n="78">Than those their conquerors , who leave behind</l>
     <l n="79">Nothing but ruin wheresoe'er they rove ,</l>
     <l n="80">And all the flourishing works of peace destroy ; 80</l>
     <l n="81">Then swell with pride , and must be titled Gods ,</l>
     <l n="82">Great benefactors of mankind , Deliverers ,</l>
     <l n="83">Worshipped with temple , priest , and sacrifice ?</l>
     <l n="84">One is the son of Jove , of Mars the other ;</l>
     <l n="85">Till conqueror Death discover them scarce men ,</l>
     <l n="86">Rowling in brutish vices , and deformed ,</l>
     <l n="87">Violent or shameful death their due reward .</l>
     <l n="88">But , if there be in glory aught of good ;</l>
     <l n="89">It may be means far different be attained ,</l>
     <l n="90">Without ambition , war , or violence — 90</l>
     <l n="91">By deeds of peace , by wisdom eminent ,</l>
     <l n="92">By patience , temperance . I mention still</l>
     <l n="93">Him whom thy wrongs , with saintly patience borne ,</l>
     <l n="94">Made famous in a land and times obscure ;</l>
     <l n="95">Who names not now with honour patient Job ?</l>
     <l n="96">Poor Socrates , ( who next more memorable ? )</l>
     <l n="97">By what he taught and suffered for so doing ,</l>
     <l n="98">For truth 's sake suffering death unjust , lives now</l>
     <l n="99">Equal in fame to proudest conquerors .</l>
     <l n="100">Yet , if for fame and glory aught be done , 100</l>
     <l n="101">Aught suffered — if young African for fame</l>
     <l n="102">His wasted country freed from Punic rage —</l>
     <l n="103">The deed becomes unpraised , the man at least ,</l>
     <l n="104">And loses , though but verbal , his reward .</l>
     <l n="105">Shall I seek glory , then , as vain men seek ,</l>
     <l n="106">Oft not deserved ? I seek not mine , but His</l>
     <l n="107">Who sent me , and thereby witness whence I am . ”</l>
     <l n="108">To whom the Tempter , murmuring , thus replied :—</l>
     <l n="109">“ Think not so slight of glory , therein least</l>
     <l n="110">Resembling thy great Father . He seeks glory , 110</l>
     <l n="111">And for his glory all things made , all things</l>
     <l n="112">Orders and governs ; nor content in Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="113">By all his Angels glorified , requires</l>
     <l n="114">Glory from men , from all men , good or bad ,</l>
     <l n="115">Wise or unwise , no difference , no exemption .</l>
     <l n="116">Above all sacrifice , or hallowed gift ,</l>
     <l n="117">Glory he requires , and glory he receives ,</l>
     <l n="118">Promiscuous from all nations , Jew , or Greek ,</l>
     <l n="119">Or Barbarous , nor exception hath declared ;</l>
     <l n="120">From us , his foes pronounced , glory he exacts . ” 120</l>
     <l n="121">To whom our Saviour fervently replied :</l>
     <l n="122">“ And reason ; since his Word all things produced ,</l>
     <l n="123">Though chiefly not for glory as prime end ,</l>
     <l n="124">But to shew forth his goodness , and impart</l>
     <l n="125">His good communicable to every soul</l>
     <l n="126">Freely ; of whom what could He less expect</l>
     <l n="127">Than glory and benediction — that is , thanks —</l>
     <l n="128">The slightest , easiest , readiest recompense</l>
     <l n="129">From them who could return him nothing else ,</l>
     <l n="130">And , not returning that , would likeliest render 130</l>
     <l n="131">Contempt instead , dishonour , obloquy ?</l>
     <l n="132">Hard recompense , unsuitable return</l>
     <l n="133">For so much good , so much beneficience !</l>
     <l n="134">But why should man seek glory , who of his own</l>
     <l n="135">Hath nothing , and to whom nothing belongs</l>
     <l n="136">But condemnation , ignominy , and shame —</l>
     <l n="137">Who , for so many benefits received ,</l>
     <l n="138">Turned recreant to God , ingrate and false ,</l>
     <l n="139">And so of all true good himself despoiled ;</l>
     <l n="140">Yet , sacrilegious , to himself would take 140</l>
     <l n="141">That which to God alone of right belongs ?</l>
     <l n="142">Yet so much bounty is in God , such grace ,</l>
     <l n="143">That who advances his glory , not their own ,</l>
     <l n="144">Them he himself to glory will advance . ”</l>
     <l n="145">So spake the Son of God ; and here again</l>
     <l n="146">Satan had not to answer , but stood struck</l>
     <l n="147">With guilt of his own sin — for he himself ,</l>
     <l n="148">Insatiable of glory , had lost all ;</l>
     <l n="149">Yet of another plea bethought him soon :—</l>
     <l n="150">“ Of glory , as thou wilt , ” said he , “ so deem ; 150</l>
     <l n="151">Worth or not worth the seeking , let it pass .</l>
     <l n="152">But to a Kingdom thou art born — ordained</l>
     <l n="153">To sit upon thy father David 's throne ,</l>
     <l n="154">By mother 's side thy father , though thy right</l>
     <l n="155">Be now in powerful hands , that will not part</l>
     <l n="156">Easily from possession won with arms .</l>
     <l n="157">Judaea now and all the Promised Land ,</l>
     <l n="158">Reduced a province under Roman yoke ,</l>
     <l n="159">Obeys Tiberius , nor is always ruled</l>
     <l n="160">With temperate sway : oft have they violated 160</l>
     <l n="161">The Temple , oft the Law , with foul affronts ,</l>
     <l n="162">Abominations rather , as did once</l>
     <l n="163">Antiochus . And think'st thou to regain</l>
     <l n="164">Thy right by sitting still , or thus retiring ?</l>
     <l n="165">So did not Machabeus . He indeed</l>
     <l n="166">Retired unto the Desert , but with arms ;</l>
     <l n="167">And o'er a mighty king so oft prevailed</l>
     <l n="168">That by strong hand his family obtained ,</l>
     <l n="169">Though priests , the crown , and David 's throne usurped ,</l>
     <l n="170">With Modin and her suburbs once content . 170</l>
     <l n="171">If kingdom move thee not , let move thee zeal</l>
     <l n="172">And duty — zeal and duty are not slow ,</l>
     <l n="173">But on Occasion 's forelock watchful wait :</l>
     <l n="174">They themselves rather are occasion best —</l>
     <l n="175">Zeal of thy Father 's house , duty to free</l>
     <l n="176">Thy country from her heathen servitude .</l>
     <l n="177">So shalt thou best fulfil , best verify ,</l>
     <l n="178">The Prophets old , who sung thy endless reign —</l>
     <l n="179">The happier reign the sooner it begins .</l>
     <l n="180">Rein then ; what canst thou better do the while ? ” 180</l>
     <l n="181">To whom our Saviour answer thus returned :—</l>
     <l n="182">“ All things are best fulfilled in their due time ;</l>
     <l n="183">And time there is for all things , Truth hath said .</l>
     <l n="184">If of my reign Prophetic Writ hath told</l>
     <l n="185">That it shall never end , so , when begin</l>
     <l n="186">The Father in his purpose hath decreed —</l>
     <l n="187">He in whose hand all times and seasons rowl .</l>
     <l n="188">What if he hath decreed that I shall first</l>
     <l n="189">Be tried in humble state , and things adverse ,</l>
     <l n="190">By tribulations , injuries , insults , 190</l>
     <l n="191">Contempts , and scorns , and snares , and violence ,</l>
     <l n="192">Suffering , abstaining , quietly expecting</l>
     <l n="193">Without distrust or doubt , that He may know</l>
     <l n="194">What I can suffer , how obey ? Who best</l>
     <l n="195">Can suffer best can do , best reign who first</l>
     <l n="196">Well hath obeyed — just trial ere I merit</l>
     <l n="197">My exaltation without change or end .</l>
     <l n="198">But what concerns it thee when I begin</l>
     <l n="199">My everlasting Kingdom ? Why art thou</l>
     <l n="200">Solicitous ? What moves thy inquisition ? 200</l>
     <l n="201">Know'st thou not that my rising is thy fall ,</l>
     <l n="202">And my promotion will be thy destruction ? ”</l>
     <l n="203">To whom the Tempter , inly racked , replied :—</l>
     <l n="204">“ Let that come when it comes . All hope is lost</l>
     <l n="205">Of my reception into grace ; what worse ?</l>
     <l n="206">For where no hope is left is left no fear .</l>
     <l n="207">If there be worse , the expectation more</l>
     <l n="208">Of worse torments me than the feeling can .</l>
     <l n="209">I would be at the worst ; worst is my port ,</l>
     <l n="210">My harbour , and my ultimate repose , 210</l>
     <l n="211">The end I would attain , my final good .</l>
     <l n="212">My error was my error , and my crime</l>
     <l n="213">My crime ; whatever , for itself condemned ,</l>
     <l n="214">And will alike be punished , whether thou</l>
     <l n="215">Reign or reign not — though to that gentle brow</l>
     <l n="216">Willingly I could fly , and hope thy reign ,</l>
     <l n="217">From that placid aspect and meek regard ,</l>
     <l n="218">Rather than aggravate my evil state ,</l>
     <l n="219">Would stand between me and thy Father 's ire</l>
     <l n="220">( Whose ire I dread more than the fire of Hell ) 220</l>
     <l n="221">A shelter and a kind of shading cool</l>
     <l n="222">Interposition , as a summer 's cloud .</l>
     <l n="223">If I , then , to the worst that can be haste ,</l>
     <l n="224">Why move thy feet so slow to what is best ?</l>
     <l n="225">Happiest , both to thyself and all the world ,</l>
     <l n="226">That thou , who worthiest art , shouldst be their King !</l>
     <l n="227">Perhaps thou linger'st in deep thoughts detained</l>
     <l n="228">Of the enterprise so hazardous and high !</l>
     <l n="229">No wonder ; for , though in thee be united</l>
     <l n="230">What of perfection can in Man be found , 230</l>
     <l n="231">Or human nature can receive , consider</l>
     <l n="232">Thy life hath yet been private , most part spent</l>
     <l n="233">At home , scarce viewed the Galilean towns ,</l>
     <l n="234">And once a year Jerusalem , few days ’</l>
     <l n="235">Short sojourn ; and what thence couldst thou observe ?</l>
     <l n="236">The world thou hast not seen , much less her glory ,</l>
     <l n="237">Empires , and monarchs , and their radiant courts —</l>
     <l n="238">Best school of best experience , quickest in sight</l>
     <l n="239">In all things that to greatest actions lead .</l>
     <l n="240">The wisest , unexperienced , will be ever 240</l>
     <l n="241">Timorous , and loth , with novice modesty</l>
     <l n="242">( As he who , seeking asses , found a kingdom )</l>
     <l n="243">Irresolute , unhardy , unadventrous .</l>
     <l n="244">But I will bring thee where thou soon shalt quit</l>
     <l n="245">Those rudiments , and see before thine eyes</l>
     <l n="246">The monarchies of the Earth , their pomp and state —</l>
     <l n="247">Sufficient introduction to inform</l>
     <l n="248">Thee , of thyself so apt , in regal arts ,</l>
     <l n="249">And regal mysteries ; that thou may'st know</l>
     <l n="250">How best their opposition to withstand . ” 250</l>
     <l n="251">With that ( such power was given him then ) , he took</l>
     <l n="252">The Son of God up to a mountain high .</l>
     <l n="253">It was a mountain at whose verdant feet</l>
     <l n="254">A spacious plain outstretched in circuit wide</l>
     <l n="255">Lay pleasant ; from his side two rivers flowed ,</l>
     <l n="256">The one winding , the other straight , and left between</l>
     <l n="257">Fair champaign , with less rivers interveined ,</l>
     <l n="258">Then meeting joined their tribute to the sea .</l>
     <l n="259">Fertil of corn the glebe , of oil , and wine ;</l>
     <l n="260">With herds the pasture thronged , with flocks the hills ; 260</l>
     <l n="261">Huge cities and high-towered , that well might seem</l>
     <l n="262">The seats of mightiest monarchs ; and so large</l>
     <l n="263">The prospect was that here and there was room</l>
     <l n="264">For barren desert , fountainless and dry .</l>
     <l n="265">To this high mountain-top the Tempter brought</l>
     <l n="266">Our Saviour , and new train of words began :—</l>
     <l n="267">“ Well have we speeded , and o'er hill and dale ,</l>
     <l n="268">Forest , and field , and flood , temples and towers ,</l>
     <l n="269">Cut shorter many a league . Here thou behold'st</l>
     <l n="270">Assyria , and her empire 's ancient bounds , 270</l>
     <l n="271">Araxes and the Caspian lake ; thence on</l>
     <l n="272">As far as Indus east , Euphrates west ,</l>
     <l n="273">And oft beyond ; to south the Persian bay ,</l>
     <l n="274">And , inaccessible , the Arabian drouth :</l>
     <l n="275">Here , Nineveh , of length within her wall</l>
     <l n="276">Several days ’ journey , built by Ninus old ,</l>
     <l n="277">Of that first golden monarchy the seat ,</l>
     <l n="278">And seat of Salmanassar , whose success</l>
     <l n="279">Israel in long captivity still mourns ;</l>
     <l n="280">There Babylon , the wonder of all tongues , 280</l>
     <l n="281">As ancient , but rebuilt by him who twice</l>
     <l n="282">Judah and all thy father David 's house</l>
     <l n="283">Led captive , and Jerusalem laid waste ,</l>
     <l n="284">Till Cyrus set them free ; Persepolis ,</l>
     <l n="285">His city , there thou seest , and Bactra there ;</l>
     <l n="286">Ecbatana her structure vast there shews ,</l>
     <l n="287">And Hecatompylos her hunderd gates ;</l>
     <l n="288">There Susa by Choaspes , amber stream ,</l>
     <l n="289">The drink of none but kings ; of later fame ,</l>
     <l n="290">Built by Emathian or by Parthian hands , 290</l>
     <l n="291">The great Seleucia , Nisibis , and there</l>
     <l n="292">Artaxata , Teredon , Ctesiphon ,</l>
     <l n="293">Turning with easy eye , thou may'st behold .</l>
     <l n="294">All these the Parthian ( now some ages past</l>
     <l n="295">By great Arsaces led , who founded first</l>
     <l n="296">That empire ) under his dominion holds ,</l>
     <l n="297">From the luxurious kings of Antioch won .</l>
     <l n="298">And just in time thou com'st to have a view</l>
     <l n="299">Of his great power ; for now the Parthian king</l>
     <l n="300">In Ctesiphon hath gathered all his host 300</l>
     <l n="301">Against the Scythian , whose incursions wild</l>
     <l n="302">Have wasted Sogdiana ; to her aid</l>
     <l n="303">He marches now in haste . See , though from far ,</l>
     <l n="304">His thousands , in what martial equipage</l>
     <l n="305">They issue forth , steel bows and shafts their arms ,</l>
     <l n="306">Of equal dread in flight or in pursuit —</l>
     <l n="307">All horsemen , in which fight they most excel ;</l>
     <l n="308">See how in warlike muster they appear ,</l>
     <l n="309">In rhombs , and wedges , and half-moons , and wings . ”</l>
     <l n="310">He looked , and saw what numbers numberless 310</l>
     <l n="311">The city gates outpoured , light-armed troops</l>
     <l n="312">In coats of mail and military pride .</l>
     <l n="313">In mail their horses clad , yet fleet and strong ,</l>
     <l n="314">Prauncing their riders bore , the flower and choice</l>
     <l n="315">Of many provinces from bound to bound —</l>
     <l n="316">From Arachosia , from Candaor east ,</l>
     <l n="317">And Margiana , to the Hyrcanian cliffs</l>
     <l n="318">Of Caucasus , and dark Iberian dales ;</l>
     <l n="319">From Atropatia , and the neighbouring plains</l>
     <l n="320">Of Adiabene , Media , and the south 320</l>
     <l n="321">Of Susiana , to Balsara 's haven .</l>
     <l n="322">He saw them in their forms of battle ranged ,</l>
     <l n="323">How quick they wheeled , and flying behind them shot</l>
     <l n="324">Sharp sleet of arrowy showers against the face</l>
     <l n="325">Of their pursuers , and overcame by flight ;</l>
     <l n="326">The field all iron cast a gleaming brown .</l>
     <l n="327">Nor wanted clouds of foot , nor , on each horn ,</l>
     <l n="328">Cuirassiers all in steel for standing fight ,</l>
     <l n="329">Chariots , or elephants indorsed with towers</l>
     <l n="330">Of archers ; nor of labouring pioners 330</l>
     <l n="331">A multitude , with spades and axes armed ,</l>
     <l n="332">To lay hills plain , fell woods , or valleys fill ,</l>
     <l n="333">Or where plain was raise hill , or overlay</l>
     <l n="334">With bridges rivers proud , as with a yoke :</l>
     <l n="335">Mules after these , camels and dromedaries ,</l>
     <l n="336">And waggons fraught with utensils of war .</l>
     <l n="337">Such forces met not , nor so wide a camp ,</l>
     <l n="338">When Agrican , with all his northern powers ,</l>
     <l n="339">Besieged Albracea , as romances tell ,</l>
     <l n="340">The city of Gallaphrone , from thence to win 340</l>
     <l n="341">The fairest of her sex , Angelica ,</l>
     <l n="342">His daughter , sought by many prowest knights ,</l>
     <l n="343">Both Paynim and the peers of Charlemane .</l>
     <l n="344">Such and so numerous was their chivalry ;</l>
     <l n="345">At sight whereof the Fiend yet more presumed ,</l>
     <l n="346">And to our Saviour thus his words renewed :—</l>
     <l n="347">“ That thou may'st know I seek not to engage</l>
     <l n="348">Thy virtue , and not every way secure</l>
     <l n="349">On no slight grounds thy safety , hear and mark</l>
     <l n="350">To what end I have brought thee hither , and shew 350</l>
     <l n="351">All this fair sight . Thy kingdom , though foretold</l>
     <l n="352">By Prophet or by Angel , unless thou</l>
     <l n="353">Endeavour , as thy father David did ,</l>
     <l n="354">Thou never shalt obtain : prediction still</l>
     <l n="355">In all things , and all men , supposes means ;</l>
     <l n="356">Without means used , what it predicts revokes .</l>
     <l n="357">But say thou wert possessed of David 's throne</l>
     <l n="358">By free consent of all , none opposite ,</l>
     <l n="359">Samaritan or Jew ; how couldst thou hope</l>
     <l n="360">Long to enjoy it quiet and secure 360</l>
     <l n="361">Between two such enclosing enemies ,</l>
     <l n="362">Roman and Parthian ? Therefore one of these</l>
     <l n="363">Thou must make sure thy own : the Parthian first ,</l>
     <l n="364">By my advice , as nearer , and of late</l>
     <l n="365">Found able by invasion to annoy</l>
     <l n="366">Thy country , and captive lead away her kings ,</l>
     <l n="367">Antigonus and old Hyrcanus , bound ,</l>
     <l n="368">Maugre the Roman . It shall be my task</l>
     <l n="369">To render thee the Parthian at dispose ,</l>
     <l n="370">Choose which thou wilt , by conquest or by league . 370</l>
     <l n="371">By him thou shalt regain , without him not ,</l>
     <l n="372">That which alone can truly reinstall thee</l>
     <l n="373">In David 's royal seat , his true successor —</l>
     <l n="374">Deliverance of thy brethren , those Ten Tribes</l>
     <l n="375">Whose offspring in his territory yet serve</l>
     <l n="376">In Habor , and among the Medes dispersed :</l>
     <l n="377">The sons of Jacob , two of Joseph , lost</l>
     <l n="378">Thus long from Israel , serving , as of old</l>
     <l n="379">Their fathers in the land of Egypt served ,</l>
     <l n="380">This offer sets before thee to deliver . 380</l>
     <l n="381">These if from servitude thou shalt restore</l>
     <l n="382">To their inheritance , then , nor till then ,</l>
     <l n="383">Thou on the throne of David in full glory ,</l>
     <l n="384">From Egypt to Euphrates and beyond ,</l>
     <l n="385">Shalt reign , and Rome or Caesar not need fear . ”</l>
     <l n="386">To whom our Saviour answered thus , unmoved :—</l>
     <l n="387">“ Much ostentation vain of fleshly arm</l>
     <l n="388">And fragile arms , much instrument of war ,</l>
     <l n="389">Long in preparing , soon to nothing brought ,</l>
     <l n="390">Before mine eyes thou hast set , and in my ear 390</l>
     <l n="391">Vented much policy , and projects deep</l>
     <l n="392">Of enemies , of aids , battles , and leagues ,</l>
     <l n="393">Plausible to the world , to me worth naught .</l>
     <l n="394">Means I must use , thou say'st ; prediction else</l>
     <l n="395">Will unpredict , and fail me of the throne !</l>
     <l n="396">My time , I told thee ( and that time for thee</l>
     <l n="397">Were better farthest off ) , is not yet come .</l>
     <l n="398">When that comes , think not thou to find me slack</l>
     <l n="399">On my part aught endeavouring , or to need</l>
     <l n="400">Thy politic maxims , or that cumbersome 400</l>
     <l n="401">Luggage of war there shewn me — argument</l>
     <l n="402">Of human weakness rather than of strength .</l>
     <l n="403">My brethren , as thou call'st them , those Ten Tribes ,</l>
     <l n="404">I must deliver , if I mean to reign</l>
     <l n="405">David 's true heir , and his full sceptre sway</l>
     <l n="406">To just extent over all Israel 's sons !</l>
     <l n="407">But whence to thee this zeal ? Where was it then</l>
     <l n="408">For Israel , or for David , or his throne ,</l>
     <l n="409">When thou stood'st up his tempter to the pride</l>
     <l n="410">Of numbering Israel — which cost the lives 410</l>
     <l n="411">of threescore and ten thousand Israelites</l>
     <l n="412">By three days ’ pestilence ? Such was thy zeal</l>
     <l n="413">To Israel then , the same that now to me .</l>
     <l n="414">As for those captive tribes , themselves were they</l>
     <l n="415">Who wrought their own captivity , fell off</l>
     <l n="416">From God to worship calves , the deities</l>
     <l n="417">Of Egypt , Baal next and Ashtaroth ,</l>
     <l n="418">And all the idolatries of heathen round ,</l>
     <l n="419">Besides their other worse than heathenish crimes ;</l>
     <l n="420">Nor in the land of their captivity 420</l>
     <l n="421">Humbled themselves , or penitent besought</l>
     <l n="422">The God of their forefathers , but so died</l>
     <l n="423">Impenitent , and left a race behind</l>
     <l n="424">Like to themselves , distinguishable scarce</l>
     <l n="425">From Gentiles , but by circumcision vain ,</l>
     <l n="426">And God with idols in their worship joined .</l>
     <l n="427">Should I of these the liberty regard ,</l>
     <l n="428">Who , freed , as to their ancient patrimony ,</l>
     <l n="429">Unhumbled , unrepentant , unreformed ,</l>
     <l n="430">Headlong would follow , and to their gods perhaps 430</l>
     <l n="431">Of Bethel and of Dan ? No ; let them serve</l>
     <l n="432">Their enemies who serve idols with God .</l>
     <l n="433">Yet He at length , time to himself best known ,</l>
     <l n="434">Remembering Abraham , by some wondrous call</l>
     <l n="435">May bring them back , repentant and sincere ,</l>
     <l n="436">And at their passing cleave the Assyrian flood ,</l>
     <l n="437">While to their native land with joy they haste ,</l>
     <l n="438">As the Red Sea and Jordan once he cleft ,</l>
     <l n="439">When to the Promised Land their fathers passed .</l>
     <l n="440">To his due time and providence I leave them . ” 440</l>
     <l n="441">So spake Israel 's true King , and to the Fiend</l>
     <l n="442">Made answer meet , that made void all his wiles .</l>
     <l n="443">So fares it when with truth falsehood contends .</l>

     <l n="1">Perplexed and troubled at his bad success</l>
     <l n="2">The Tempter stood , nor had what to reply ,</l>

     <l n="10">But — as a man who had been matchless held 10</l>
     <l n="11">In cunning , over-reached where least he thought ,</l>
     <l n="12">To salve his credit , and for very spite ,</l>
     <l n="13">Still will be tempting him who foils him still ,</l>
     <l n="14">And never cease , though to his shame the more ;</l>

     <l n="16">About the wine-press where sweet must is poured ,</l>
     <l n="17">Beat off , returns as oft with humming sound ;</l>
     <l n="18">Or surging waves against a solid rock ,</l>
     <l n="19">Though all to shivers dashed , the assault renew ,</l>
     <l n="20">( Vain battery ! ) and in froth or bubbles end — 20</l>
     <l n="21">So Satan , whom repulse upon repulse</l>

     <l n="23">Yet gives not o'er , though desperate of success ,</l>
     <l n="24">And his vain importunity pursues .</l>
     <l n="25">He brought our Saviour to the western side</l>
     <l n="26">Of that high mountain , whence he might behold</l>
     <l n="27">Another plain , long , but in breadth not wide ,</l>
     <l n="28">Washed by the southern sea , and on the north</l>
     <l n="29">To equal length backed with a ridge of hills</l>
     <l n="30">That screened the fruits of the earth and seats of men 30</l>
     <l n="31">From cold Septentrion blasts ; thence in the midst</l>
     <l n="32">Divided by a river , off whose banks</l>
     <l n="33">On each side an Imperial City stood ,</l>
     <l n="34">With towers and temples proudly elevate</l>

     <l n="37">Statues and trophies , and triumphal arcs ,</l>
     <l n="38">Gardens and groves , presented to his eyes</l>
     <l n="39">Above the highth of mountains interposed —</l>
     <l n="40">By what strange parallax , or optic skill 40</l>
     <l n="41">Of vision , multiplied through air , or glass</l>
     <l n="42">Of telescope , were curious to enquire .</l>
     <l n="43">And now the Tempter thus his silence broke :—</l>
     <l n="44">“ The city which thou seest no other deem</l>
     <l n="45">Than great and glorious Rome , Queen of the Earth</l>
     <l n="46">So far renowned , and with the spoils enriched</l>
     <l n="47">Of nations . There the Capitol thou seest ,</l>
     <l n="48">Above the rest lifting his stately head</l>
     <l n="49">On the Tarpeian rock , her citadel</l>
     <l n="50">Impregnable ; and there Mount Palatine , 50</l>
     <l n="51">The imperial palace , compass huge , and high</l>
     <l n="52">The structure , skill of noblest architects ,</l>
     <l n="53">With gilded battlements , conspicuous far ,</l>
     <l n="54">Turrets , and terraces , and glittering spires .</l>
     <l n="55">Many a fair edifice besides , more like</l>
     <l n="56">Houses of gods — so well I have disposed</l>
     <l n="57">My aerie microscope — thou may'st behold ,</l>
     <l n="58">Outside and inside both , pillars and roofs</l>
     <l n="59">Carved work , the hand of famed artificers</l>
     <l n="60">In cedar , marble , ivory , or gold . 60</l>
     <l n="61">Thence to the gates cast round thine eye , and see</l>
     <l n="62">What conflux issuing forth , or entering in :</l>
     <l n="63">Praetors , proconsuls to their provinces</l>
     <l n="64">Hasting , or on return , in robes of state ;</l>
     <l n="65">Lictors and rods , the ensigns of their power ;</l>
     <l n="66">Legions and cohorts , turms of horse and wings ;</l>
     <l n="67">Or embassies from regions far remote ,</l>
     <l n="68">In various habits , on the Appian road ,</l>
     <l n="69">Or on the AEmilian — some from farthest south ,</l>
     <l n="70">Syene , and where the shadow both way falls , 70</l>
     <l n="71">Meroe , Nilotic isle , and , more to west ,</l>
     <l n="72">The realm of Bocchus to the Blackmoor sea ;</l>
     <l n="73">From the Asian kings ( and Parthian among these ) ,</l>
     <l n="74">From India and the Golden Chersoness ,</l>
     <l n="75">And utmost Indian isle Taprobane ,</l>
     <l n="76">Dusk faces with white silken turbants wreathed ;</l>
     <l n="77">From Gallia , Gades , and the British west ;</l>
     <l n="78">Germans , and Scythians , and Sarmatians north</l>
     <l n="79">Beyond Danubius to the Tauric pool .</l>
     <l n="80">All nations now to Rome obedience pay — 80</l>
     <l n="81">To Rome 's great Emperor , whose wide domain ,</l>
     <l n="82">In ample territory , wealth and power ,</l>
     <l n="83">Civility of manners , arts and arms ,</l>
     <l n="84">And long renown , thou justly may'st prefer</l>
     <l n="85">Before the Parthian . These two thrones except ,</l>
     <l n="86">The rest are barbarous , and scarce worth the sight ,</l>
     <l n="87">Shared among petty kings too far removed ;</l>
     <l n="88">These having shewn thee , I have shewn thee all</l>
     <l n="89">The kingdoms of the world , and all their glory .</l>
     <l n="90">This Emperor hath no son , and now is old , 90</l>
     <l n="91">Old and lascivious , and from Rome retired</l>
     <l n="92">To Capreae , an island small but strong</l>
     <l n="93">On the Campanian shore , with purpose there</l>
     <l n="94">His horrid lusts in private to enjoy ;</l>
     <l n="95">Committing to a wicked favourite</l>
     <l n="96">All public cares , and yet of him suspicious ;</l>
     <l n="97">Hated of all , and hating . With what ease ,</l>
     <l n="98">Endued with regal virtues as thou art ,</l>
     <l n="99">Appearing , and beginning noble deeds ,</l>
     <l n="100">Might'st thou expel this monster from his throne , 100</l>
     <l n="101">Now made a sty , and , in his place ascending ,</l>
     <l n="102">A victor-people free from servile yoke !</l>
     <l n="103">And with my help thou may'st ; to me the power</l>
     <l n="104">Is given , and by that right I give it thee .</l>
     <l n="105">Aim , therefore , at no less than all the world ;</l>
     <l n="106">Aim at the highest ; without the highest attained ,</l>
     <l n="107">Will be for thee no sitting , or not long ,</l>
     <l n="108">On David 's throne , be prophesied what will . ”</l>
     <l n="109">To whom the Son of God , unmoved , replied :—</l>
     <l n="110">“ Nor doth this grandeur and majestic shew 110</l>
     <l n="111">Of luxury , though called magnificence ,</l>
     <l n="112">More than of arms before , allure mine eye ,</l>
     <l n="113">Much less my mind ; though thou should'st add to tell</l>
     <l n="114">Their sumptuous gluttonies , and gorgeous feasts</l>
     <l n="115">On citron tables or Atlantic stone</l>
     <l n="116">( For I have also heard , perhaps have read ) ,</l>
     <l n="117">Their wines of Setia , Cales , and Falerne ,</l>
     <l n="118">Chios and Crete , and how they quaff in gold ,</l>
     <l n="119">Crystal , and myrrhine cups , imbossed with gems</l>
     <l n="120">And studs of pearl — to me should'st tell , who thirst 120</l>
     <l n="121">And hunger still . Then embassies thou shew'st</l>
     <l n="122">From nations far and nigh ! What honour that ,</l>
     <l n="123">But tedious waste of time , to sit and hear</l>
     <l n="124">So many hollow compliments and lies ,</l>
     <l n="125">Outlandish flatteries ? Then proceed'st to talk</l>
     <l n="126">Of the Emperor , how easily subdued ,</l>
     <l n="127">How gloriously . I shall , thou say'st , expel</l>
     <l n="128">A brutish monster : what if I withal</l>
     <l n="129">Expel a Devil who first made him such ?</l>
     <l n="130">Let his tormentor , Conscience , find him out ; 130</l>
     <l n="131">For him I was not sent , nor yet to free</l>
     <l n="132">That people , victor once , now vile and base ,</l>
     <l n="133">Deservedly made vassal — who , once just ,</l>
     <l n="134">Frugal , and mild , and temperate , conquered well ,</l>
     <l n="135">But govern ill the nations under yoke ,</l>
     <l n="136">Peeling their provinces , exhausted all</l>
     <l n="137">By lust and rapine ; first ambitious grown</l>
     <l n="138">Of triumph , that insulting vanity ;</l>
     <l n="139">Then cruel , by their sports to blood inured</l>
     <l n="140">Of fighting beasts , and men to beasts exposed ; 140</l>
     <l n="141">Luxurious by their wealth , and greedier still ,</l>
     <l n="142">And from the daily Scene effeminate .</l>
     <l n="143">What wise and valiant man would seek to free</l>
     <l n="144">These , thus degenerate , by themselves enslaved ,</l>
     <l n="145">Or could of inward slaves make outward free ?</l>
     <l n="146">Know , therefore , when my season comes to sit</l>
     <l n="147">On David 's throne , it shall be like a tree</l>
     <l n="148">Spreading and overshadowing all the earth ,</l>
     <l n="149">Or as a stone that shall to pieces dash</l>
     <l n="150">All monarchies besides throughout the world ; 150</l>
     <l n="151">And of my Kingdom there shall be no end .</l>
     <l n="152">Means there shall be to this ; but what the means</l>
     <l n="153">Is not for thee to know , nor me to tell . ”</l>
     <l n="154">To whom the Tempter , impudent , replied :—</l>
     <l n="155">“ I see all offers made by me how slight</l>
     <l n="156">Thou valuest , because offered , and reject'st .</l>
     <l n="157">Nothing will please the difficult and nice ,</l>
     <l n="158">Or nothing more than still to contradict .</l>
     <l n="159">On the other side know also thou that I</l>
     <l n="160">On what I offer set as high esteem , 160</l>
     <l n="161">Nor what I part with mean to give for naught ,</l>
     <l n="162">All these , which in a moment thou behold'st ,</l>
     <l n="163">The kingdoms of the world , to thee I give</l>
     <l n="164">( For , given to me , I give to whom I please ) ,</l>
     <l n="165">No trifle ; yet with this reserve , not else —</l>
     <l n="166">On this condition , if thou wilt fall down ,</l>
     <l n="167">And worship me as thy superior Lord</l>
     <l n="168">( Easily done ) , and hold them all of me ;</l>
     <l n="169">For what can less so great a gift deserve ? ”</l>
     <l n="170">Whom thus our Saviour answered with disdain :— 170</l>
     <l n="171">“ I never liked thy talk , thy offers less ;</l>
     <l n="172">Now both abhor , since thou hast dared to utter</l>
     <l n="173">The abominable terms , impious condition .</l>
     <l n="174">But I endure the time , till which expired</l>
     <l n="175">Thou hast permission on me . It is written ,</l>
     <l n="176">The first of all commandments , ‘ Thou shalt worship</l>
     <l n="177">The Lord thy God , and only Him shalt serve . ’</l>
     <l n="178">And dar'st thou to the Son of God propound</l>
     <l n="179">To worship thee , accursed ? now more accursed</l>
     <l n="180">For this attempt , bolder than that on Eve , 180</l>
     <l n="181">And more blasphemous ; which expect to rue .</l>
     <l n="182">The kingdoms of the world to thee were given !</l>
     <l n="183">Permitted rather , and by thee usurped ;</l>
     <l n="184">Other donation none thou canst produce .</l>
     <l n="185">If given , by whom but by the King of kings ,</l>
     <l n="186">God over all supreme ? If given to thee ,</l>
     <l n="187">By thee how fairly is the Giver now</l>
     <l n="188">Repaid ! But gratitude in thee is lost</l>
     <l n="189">Long since . Wert thou so void of fear or shame</l>
     <l n="190">As offer them to me , the Son of God — 190</l>
     <l n="191">To me my own , on such abhorred pact ,</l>
     <l n="192">That I fall down and worship thee as God ?</l>
     <l n="193">Get thee behind me ! Plain thou now appear'st</l>
     <l n="194">That Evil One , Satan for ever damned . ”</l>
     <l n="195">To whom the Fiend , with fear abashed , replied :—</l>
     <l n="196">“ Be not so sore offended , Son of God —</l>
     <l n="197">Though Sons of God both Angels are and Men —</l>
     <l n="198">If I , to try whether in higher sort</l>
     <l n="199">Than these thou bear'st that title , have proposed</l>
     <l n="200">What both from Men and Angels I receive , 200</l>
     <l n="201">Tetrarchs of Fire , Air , Flood , and on the Earth</l>
     <l n="202">Nations besides from all the quartered winds —</l>
     <l n="203">God of this World invoked , and World beneath .</l>
     <l n="204">Who then thou art , whose coming is foretold</l>
     <l n="205">To me most fatal , me it most concerns .</l>
     <l n="206">The trial hath indamaged thee no way ,</l>
     <l n="207">Rather more honour left and more esteem ;</l>
     <l n="208">Me naught advantaged , missing what I aimed .</l>
     <l n="209">Therefore let pass , as they are transitory ,</l>
     <l n="210">The kingdoms of this world ; I shall no more 210</l>
     <l n="211">Advise thee ; gain them as thou canst , or not .</l>
     <l n="212">And thou thyself seem'st otherwise inclined</l>
     <l n="213">Than to a worldly crown , addicted more</l>
     <l n="214">To contemplation and profound dispute ;</l>
     <l n="215">As by that early action may be judged ,</l>
     <l n="216">When , slipping from thy mother 's eye , thou went'st</l>
     <l n="217">Alone into the Temple , there wast found</l>
     <l n="218">Among the gravest Rabbies , disputant</l>
     <l n="219">On points and questions fitting Moses ’ chair ,</l>
     <l n="220">Teaching , not taught . The childhood shews the man , 220</l>
     <l n="221">As morning shews the day . Be famous , then ,</l>
     <l n="222">By wisdom ; as thy empire must extend ,</l>
     <l n="223">So let extend thy mind o'er all the world</l>
     <l n="224">In knowledge ; all things in it comprehend .</l>
     <l n="225">All knowledge is not couched in Moses ’ law ,</l>
     <l n="226">The Pentateuch , or what the Prophets wrote ;</l>
     <l n="227">The Gentiles also know , and write , and teach</l>
     <l n="228">To admiration , led by Nature 's light ;</l>
     <l n="229">And with the Gentiles much thou must converse ,</l>
     <l n="230">Ruling them by persuasion , as thou mean'st . 230</l>
     <l n="231">Without their learning , how wilt thou with them ,</l>
     <l n="232">Or they with thee , hold conversation meet ?</l>
     <l n="233">How wilt thou reason with them , how refute</l>
     <l n="234">Their idolisms , traditions , paradoxes ?</l>
     <l n="235">Error by his own arms is best evinced .</l>
     <l n="236">Look once more , ere we leave this specular mount ,</l>
     <l n="237">Westward , much nearer by south-west ; behold</l>
     <l n="238">Where on the AEgean shore a city stands ,</l>
     <l n="239">Built nobly , pure the air and light the soil —</l>
     <l n="240">Athens , the eye of Greece , mother of arts 240</l>
     <l n="241">And Eloquence , native to famous wits</l>
     <l n="242">Or hospitable , in her sweet recess ,</l>
     <l n="243">City or suburban , studious walks and shades .</l>
     <l n="244">See there the olive-grove of Academe ,</l>
     <l n="245">Plato 's retirement , where the Attic bird</l>
     <l n="246">Trills her thick-warbled notes the summer long ;</l>
     <l n="247">There , flowery hill , Hymettus , with the sound</l>
     <l n="248">Of bees ’ industrious murmur , oft invites</l>
     <l n="249">To studious musing ; there Ilissus rowls</l>
     <l n="250">His whispering stream . Within the walls then view 250</l>
     <l n="251">The schools of ancient sages — his who bred</l>
     <l n="252">Great Alexander to subdue the world ,</l>
     <l n="253">Lyceum there ; and painted Stoa next .</l>
     <l n="254">There thou shalt hear and learn the secret power</l>
     <l n="255">Of harmony , in tones and numbers hit</l>
     <l n="256">By voice or hand , and various-measured verse ,</l>
     <l n="257">AEolian charms and Dorian lyric odes ,</l>
     <l n="258">And his who gave them breath , but higher sung ,</l>
     <l n="259">Blind Melesigenes , thence Homer called ,</l>
     <l n="260">Whose poem Phoebus challenged for his own . 260</l>
     <l n="261">Thence what the lofty grave Tragedians taught</l>
     <l n="262">In chorus or iambic , teachers best</l>
     <l n="263">Of moral prudence , with delight received</l>
     <l n="264">In brief sententious precepts , while they treat</l>
     <l n="265">Of fate , and chance , and change in human life ,</l>
     <l n="266">High actions and high passions best describing .</l>
     <l n="267">Thence to the famous Orators repair ,</l>
     <l n="268">Those ancient whose resistless eloquence</l>
     <l n="269">Wielded at will that fierce democraty ,</l>
     <l n="270">Shook the Arsenal , and fulmined over Greece 270</l>

     <l n="274">Of Socrates — see there his tenement —</l>
     <l n="275">Whom , well inspired , the Oracle pronounced</l>
     <l n="276">Wisest of men ; from whose mouth issued forth</l>
     <l n="277">Mellifluous streams , that watered all the schools</l>
     <l n="278">Of Academics old and new , with those</l>
     <l n="279">Surnamed Peripatetics , and the sect</l>

     <l n="284">Within thyself , much more with empire joined . ”</l>
     <l n="285">To whom our Saviour sagely thus replied :—</l>
     <l n="286">“ Think not but that I know these things ; or , think</l>
     <l n="287">I know them not , not therefore am I short</l>
     <l n="288">Of knowing what I ought . He who receives</l>
     <l n="289">Light from above , from the Fountain of Light ,</l>
     <l n="290">No other doctrine needs , though granted true ; 290</l>
     <l n="291">But these are false , or little else but dreams ,</l>
     <l n="292">Conjectures , fancies , built on nothing firm .</l>
     <l n="293">The first and wisest of them all professed</l>
     <l n="294">To know this only , that he nothing knew ;</l>
     <l n="295">The next to fabling fell and smooth conceits ;</l>
     <l n="296">A third sort doubted all things , though plain sense ;</l>
     <l n="297">Others in virtue placed felicity ,</l>
     <l n="298">But virtue joined with riches and long life ;</l>
     <l n="299">In corporal pleasure he , and careless ease ;</l>
     <l n="300">The Stoic last in philosophic pride , 300</l>
     <l n="301">By him called virtue , and his virtuous man ,</l>
     <l n="302">Wise , perfect in himself , and all possessing ,</l>
     <l n="303">Equal to God , oft shames not to prefer ,</l>
     <l n="304">As fearing God nor man , contemning all</l>
     <l n="305">Wealth , pleasure , pain or torment , death and life —</l>
     <l n="306">Which , when he lists , he leaves , or boasts he can ;</l>
     <l n="307">For all his tedious talk is but vain boast ,</l>
     <l n="308">Or subtle shifts conviction to evade .</l>
     <l n="309">Alas ! what can they teach , and not mislead ,</l>
     <l n="310">Ignorant of themselves , of God much more , 310</l>
     <l n="311">And how the World began , and how Man fell ,</l>
     <l n="312">Degraded by himself , on grace depending ?</l>
     <l n="313">Much of the Soul they talk , but all awry ;</l>

     <l n="316">Rather accuse him under usual names ,</l>
     <l n="317">Fortune and Fate , as one regardless quite</l>

     <l n="319">True wisdom finds her not , or , by delusion</l>
     <l n="320">Far worse , her false resemblance only meets , 320</l>
     <l n="321">An empty cloud . However , many books ,</l>
     <l n="322">Wise men have said , are wearisome ; who reads</l>
     <l n="323">Incessantly , and to his reading brings not</l>
     <l n="324">A spirit and judgment equal or superior ,</l>
     <l n="325">( And what he brings what needs he elsewhere seek ? )</l>
     <l n="326">Uncertain and unsettled still remains ,</l>
     <l n="327">Deep-versed in books and shallow in himself ,</l>

     <l n="338">That rather Greece from us these arts derived —</l>
     <l n="339">Ill imitated while they loudest sing</l>
     <l n="340">The vices of their deities , and their own , 340</l>
     <l n="341">In fable , hymn , or song , so personating</l>
     <l n="342">Their gods ridiculous , and themselves past shame .</l>
     <l n="343">Remove their swelling epithetes , thick-laid</l>
     <l n="344">As varnish on a harlot 's cheek , the rest ,</l>
     <l n="345">Thin-sown with aught of profit or delight ,</l>
     <l n="346">Will far be found unworthy to compare</l>
     <l n="347">With Sion 's songs , to all true tastes excelling ,</l>
     <l n="348">Where God is praised aright and godlike men ,</l>
     <l n="349">The Holiest of Holies and his Saints</l>
     <l n="350">( Such are from God inspired , not such from thee ) ; 350</l>
     <l n="351">Unless where moral virtue is expressed</l>
     <l n="352">By light of Nature , not in all quite lost .</l>
     <l n="353">Their orators thou then extoll'st as those</l>
     <l n="354">The top of eloquence — statists indeed ,</l>
     <l n="355">And lovers of their country , as may seem ;</l>
     <l n="356">But herein to our Prophets far beneath ,</l>
     <l n="357">As men divinely taught , and better teaching</l>
     <l n="358">The solid rules of civil government ,</l>
     <l n="359">In their majestic , unaffected style ,</l>
     <l n="360">Than all the oratory of Greece and Rome . 360</l>
     <l n="361">In them is plainest taught , and easiest learnt ,</l>
     <l n="362">What makes a nation happy , and keeps it so ,</l>
     <l n="363">What ruins kingdoms , and lays cities flat ;</l>
     <l n="364">These only , with our Law , best form a king . ”</l>
     <l n="365">So spake the Son of God ; but Satan , now</l>
     <l n="366">Quite at a loss ( for all his darts were spent ) ,</l>
     <l n="367">Thus to our Saviour , with stern brow , replied :—</l>
     <l n="368">“ Since neither wealth nor honour , arms nor arts ,</l>
     <l n="369">Kingdom nor empire , pleases thee , nor aught</l>
     <l n="370">By me proposed in life contemplative 370</l>
     <l n="371">Or active , tended on by glory or fame ,</l>
     <l n="372">What dost thou in this world ? The Wilderness</l>
     <l n="373">For thee is fittest place : I found thee there ,</l>
     <l n="374">And thither will return thee . Yet remember</l>
     <l n="375">What I foretell thee ; soon thou shalt have cause</l>
     <l n="376">To wish thou never hadst rejected , thus</l>
     <l n="377">Nicely or cautiously , my offered aid ,</l>
     <l n="378">Which would have set thee in short time with ease</l>
     <l n="379">On David 's throne , or throne of all the world ,</l>
     <l n="380">Now at full age , fulness of time , thy season , 380</l>
     <l n="381">When prophecies of thee are best fulfilled .</l>
     <l n="382">Now , contrary — if I read aught in heaven ,</l>
     <l n="383">Or heaven write aught of fate — by what the stars</l>
     <l n="384">Voluminous , or single characters</l>
     <l n="385">In their conjunction met , give me to spell ,</l>
     <l n="386">Sorrows and labours , opposition , hate ,</l>
     <l n="387">Attends thee ; scorns , reproaches , injuries ,</l>
     <l n="388">Violence and stripes , and , lastly , cruel death .</l>
     <l n="389">A kingdom they portend thee , but what kingdom ,</l>
     <l n="390">Real or allegoric , I discern not ; 390</l>
     <l n="391">Nor when : eternal sure — as without end ,</l>
     <l n="392">Without beginning ; for no date prefixed</l>
     <l n="393">Directs me in the starry rubric set . ”</l>
     <l n="394">So saying , he took ( for still he knew his power</l>
     <l n="395">Not yet expired ) , and to the Wilderness</l>
     <l n="396">Brought back , the Son of God , and left him there ,</l>
     <l n="397">Feigning to disappear . Darkness now rose ,</l>
     <l n="398">As daylight sunk , and brought in louring Night ,</l>
     <l n="399">Her shadowy offspring , unsubstantial both ,</l>
     <l n="400">Privation mere of light and absent day . 400</l>
     <l n="401">Our Saviour , meek , and with untroubled mind</l>
     <l n="402">After hisaerie jaunt , though hurried sore ,</l>
     <l n="403">Hungry and cold , betook him to his rest ,</l>
     <l n="404">Wherever , under some concourse of shades ,</l>
     <l n="405">Whose branching arms thick intertwined might shield</l>
     <l n="406">From dews and damps of night his sheltered head ;</l>
     <l n="407">But , sheltered , slept in vain ; for at his head</l>
     <l n="408">The Tempter watched , and soon with ugly dreams</l>
     <l n="409">Disturbed his sleep . And either tropic now</l>
     <l n="410">‘ Gan thunder , and both ends of heaven ; the clouds 410</l>
     <l n="411">From many a horrid rift abortive poured</l>
     <l n="412">Fierce rain with lightning mixed , water with fire ,</l>
     <l n="413">In ruin reconciled ; nor slept the winds</l>
     <l n="414">Within their stony caves , but rushed abroad</l>
     <l n="415">From the four hinges of the world , and fell</l>
     <l n="416">On the vexed wilderness , whose tallest pines ,</l>
     <l n="417">Though rooted deep as high , and sturdiest oaks ,</l>
     <l n="418">Bowed their stiff necks , loaden with stormy blasts ,</l>
     <l n="419">Or torn up sheer . Ill wast thou shrouded then ,</l>
     <l n="420">O patient Son of God , yet only stood'st 420</l>
     <l n="421">Unshaken ! Nor yet staid the terror there :</l>
     <l n="422">Infernal ghosts and hellish furies round</l>
     <l n="423">Environed thee ; some howled , some yelled , some shrieked ,</l>
     <l n="424">Some bent at thee their fiery darts , while thou</l>
     <l n="425">Sat'st unappalled in calm and sinless peace .</l>
     <l n="426">Thus passed the night so foul , till Morning fair</l>
     <l n="427">Came forth with pilgrim steps , in amice grey ,</l>
     <l n="428">Who with her radiant finger stilled the roar</l>
     <l n="429">Of thunder , chased the clouds , and laid the winds ,</l>
     <l n="430">And griesly spectres , which the Fiend had raised 430</l>
     <l n="431">To tempt the Son of God with terrors dire .</l>
     <l n="432">And now the sun with more effectual beams</l>
     <l n="433">Had cheered the face of earth , and dried the wet</l>
     <l n="434">From drooping plant , or dropping tree ; the birds ,</l>
     <l n="435">Who all things now behold more fresh and green ,</l>
     <l n="436">After a night of storm so ruinous ,</l>
     <l n="437">Cleared up their choicest notes in bush and spray ,</l>
     <l n="438">To gratulate the sweet return of morn .</l>
     <l n="439">Nor yet , amidst this joy and brightest morn ,</l>
     <l n="440">Was absent , after all his mischief done , 440</l>
     <l n="441">The Prince of Darkness ; glad would also seem</l>
     <l n="442">Of this fair change , and to our Saviour came ;</l>
     <l n="443">Yet with no new device ( they all were spent ) ,</l>
     <l n="444">Rather by this his last affront resolved ,</l>
     <l n="445">Desperate of better course , to vent his rage</l>
     <l n="446">And mad despite to be so oft repelled .</l>
     <l n="447">Him walking on a sunny hill he found ,</l>
     <l n="448">Backed on the north and west by a thick wood ;</l>
     <l n="449">Out of the wood he starts in wonted shape ,</l>
     <l n="450">And in a careless mood thus to him said :— 450</l>
     <l n="451">“ Fair morning yet betides thee , Son of God ,</l>
     <l n="452">After a dismal night . I heard the wrack ,</l>
     <l n="453">As earth and sky would mingle ; but myself</l>
     <l n="454">Was distant ; and these flaws , though mortals fear them ,</l>
     <l n="455">As dangerous to the pillared frame of Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="456">Or to the Earth 's dark basis underneath ,</l>
     <l n="457">Are to the main as inconsiderable</l>
     <l n="458">And harmless , if not wholesome , as a sneeze</l>
     <l n="459">To man 's less universe , and soon are gone .</l>
     <l n="460">Yet , as being ofttimes noxious where they light 460</l>
     <l n="461">On man , beast , plant , wasteful and turbulent ,</l>
     <l n="462">Like turbulencies in the affairs of men ,</l>
     <l n="463">Over whose heads they roar , and seem to point ,</l>
     <l n="464">They oft fore-signify and threaten ill .</l>
     <l n="465">This tempest at this desert most was bent ;</l>
     <l n="466">Of men at thee , for only thou here dwell'st .</l>
     <l n="467">Did I not tell thee , if thou didst reject</l>
     <l n="468">The perfect season offered with my aid</l>
     <l n="469">To win thy destined seat , but wilt prolong</l>
     <l n="470">All to the push of fate , pursue thy way 470</l>
     <l n="471">Of gaining David 's throne no man knows when</l>
     <l n="472">( For both the when and how is nowhere told ) ,</l>
     <l n="473">Thou shalt be what thou art ordained , no doubt ;</l>
     <l n="474">For Angels have proclaimed it , but concealing</l>
     <l n="475">The time and means ? Each act is rightliest done</l>
     <l n="476">Not when it must , but when it may be best .</l>
     <l n="477">If thou observe not this , be sure to find</l>
     <l n="478">What I foretold thee — many a hard assay</l>
     <l n="479">Of dangers , and adversities , and pains ,</l>
     <l n="480">Ere thou of Israel 's sceptre get fast hold ; 480</l>
     <l n="481">Whereof this ominous night that closed thee round ,</l>
     <l n="482">So many terrors , voices , prodigies ,</l>
     <l n="483">May warn thee , as a sure foregoing sign . ”</l>
     <l n="484">So talked he , while the Son of God went on ,</l>
     <l n="485">And staid not , but in brief him answered thus :—</l>
     <l n="486">“ Me worse than wet thou find'st not ; other harm</l>
     <l n="487">Those terrors which thou speak'st of did me none .</l>
     <l n="488">I never feared they could , though noising loud</l>
     <l n="489">And threatening nigh : what they can do as signs</l>
     <l n="490">Betokening or ill-boding I contemn 490</l>
     <l n="491">As false portents , not sent from God , but thee ;</l>
     <l n="492">Who , knowing I shall reign past thy preventing ,</l>
     <l n="493">Obtrud'st thy offered aid , that I , accepting ,</l>
     <l n="494">At least might seem to hold all power of thee ,</l>
     <l n="495">Ambitious Spirit ! and would'st be thought my God ;</l>
     <l n="496">And storm'st , refused , thinking to terrify</l>
     <l n="497">Me to thy will ! Desist ( thou art discerned ,</l>
     <l n="498">And toil'st in vain ) , nor me in vain molest . ”</l>
     <l n="499">To whom the Fiend , now swoln with rage , replied :—</l>
     <l n="500">“ Then hear , O Son of David , virgin-born ! 500</l>
     <l n="501">For Son of God to me is yet in doubt .</l>
     <l n="502">Of the Messiah I have heard foretold</l>
     <l n="503">By all the Prophets ; of thy birth , at length</l>
     <l n="504">Announced by Gabriel , with the first I knew ,</l>
     <l n="505">And of the angelic song in Bethlehem field ,</l>
     <l n="506">On thy birth-night , that sung thee Saviour born .</l>
     <l n="507">From that time seldom have I ceased to eye</l>
     <l n="508">Thy infancy , thy childhood , and thy youth ,</l>
     <l n="509">Thy manhood last , though yet in private bred ;</l>
     <l n="510">Till , at the ford of Jordan , whither all 510</l>
     <l n="511">Flocked to the Baptist , I among the rest</l>
     <l n="512">( Though not to be baptized ) , by voice from Heaven</l>
     <l n="513">Heard thee pronounced the Son of God beloved .</l>
     <l n="514">Thenceforth I thought thee worth my nearer view</l>
     <l n="515">And narrower scrutiny , that I might learn</l>
     <l n="516">In what degree or meaning thou art called</l>
     <l n="517">The Son of God , which bears no single sense .</l>
     <l n="518">The Son of God I also am , or was ;</l>
     <l n="519">And , if I was , I am ; relation stands :</l>
     <l n="520">All men are Sons of God ; yet thee I thought 520</l>
     <l n="521">In some respect far higher so declared .</l>
     <l n="522">Therefore I watched thy footsteps from that hour ,</l>
     <l n="523">And followed thee still on to this waste wild ,</l>
     <l n="524">Where , by all best conjectures , I collect</l>
     <l n="525">Thou art to be my fatal enemy .</l>
     <l n="526">Good reason , then , if I beforehand seek</l>
     <l n="527">To understand my adversary , who</l>
     <l n="528">And what he is ; his wisdom , power , intent ;</l>
     <l n="529">By parle or composition , truce or league ,</l>
     <l n="530">To win him , or win from him what I can . 530</l>
     <l n="531">And opportunity I here have had</l>
     <l n="532">To try thee , sift thee , and confess have found thee</l>
     <l n="533">Proof against all temptation , as a rock</l>
     <l n="534">Of adamant and as a centre , firm</l>
     <l n="535">To the utmost of mere man both wise and good ,</l>
     <l n="536">Not more ; for honours , riches , kingdoms , glory ,</l>
     <l n="537">Have been before contemned , and may again .</l>
     <l n="538">Therefore , to know what more thou art than man ,</l>
     <l n="539">Worth naming the Son of God by voice from Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="540">Another method I must now begin . ” 540</l>
     <l n="541">So saying , he caught him up , and , without wing</l>
     <l n="542">Of hippogrif , bore through the air sublime ,</l>
     <l n="543">Over the wilderness and o'er the plain ,</l>
     <l n="544">Till underneath them fair Jerusalem ,</l>
     <l n="545">The Holy City , lifted high her towers ,</l>
     <l n="546">And higher yet the glorious Temple reared</l>
     <l n="547">Her pile , far off appearing like a mount</l>
     <l n="548">Of alablaster , topt with golden spires :</l>
     <l n="549">There , on the highest pinnacle , he set</l>
     <l n="550">The Son of God , and added thus in scorn :— 550</l>
     <l n="551">“ There stand , if thou wilt stand ; to stand upright</l>
     <l n="552">Will ask thee skill . I to thy Father 's house</l>
     <l n="553">Have brought thee , and highest placed : highest is best .</l>
     <l n="554">Now shew thy progeny ; if not to stand ,</l>
     <l n="555">Cast thyself down . Safely , if Son of God ;</l>
     <l n="556">For it is written , ‘ He will give command</l>
     <l n="557">Concerning thee to his Angels ; in their hands</l>
     <l n="558">They shall uplift thee , lest at any time</l>
     <l n="559">Thou chance to dash thy foot against a stone . ’ ”</l>
     <l n="560">To whom thus Jesus : “ Also it is written , 560</l>
     <l n="561">‘ Tempt not the Lord thy God . ’ ” He said , and stood ;</l>
     <l n="562">But Satan , smitten with amazement , fell .</l>
     <l n="563">As when Earth 's son , Antaeus ( to compare</l>
     <l n="564">Small things with greatest ) , in Irassa strove</l>
     <l n="565">With Jove 's Alcides , and , oft foiled , still rose ,</l>
     <l n="566">Receiving from his mother Earth new strength ,</l>
     <l n="567">Fresh from his fall , and fiercer grapple joined ,</l>
     <l n="568">Throttled at length in the air expired and fell ,</l>
     <l n="569">So , after many a foil , the Tempter proud ,</l>
     <l n="570">Renewing fresh assaults , amidst his pride 570</l>
     <l n="571">Fell whence he stood to see his victor fall ;</l>
     <l n="572">And , as that Theban monster that proposed</l>
     <l n="573">Her riddle , and him who solved it not devoured ,</l>
     <l n="574">That once found out and solved , for grief and spite</l>
     <l n="575">Cast herself headlong from the Ismenian steep ,</l>
     <l n="576">So , strook with dread and anguish , fell the Fiend ,</l>
     <l n="577">And to his crew , that sat consulting , brought</l>
     <l n="578">Joyless triumphals of his hoped success ,</l>
     <l n="579">Ruin , and desperation , and dismay ,</l>
     <l n="580">Who durst so proudly tempt the Son of God . 580</l>
     <l n="581">So Satan fell ; and straight a fiery globe</l>
     <l n="582">Of Angels on full sail of wing flew nigh ,</l>
     <l n="583">Who on their plumy vans received Him soft</l>
     <l n="584">From his uneasy station , and upbore ,</l>
     <l n="585">As on a floating couch , through the blithe air ;</l>
     <l n="586">Then , in a flowery valley , set him down</l>
     <l n="587">On a green bank , and set before him spread</l>
     <l n="588">A table of celestial food , divine</l>
     <l n="589">Ambrosial fruits fetched from the Tree of Life ,</l>
     <l n="590">And from the Fount of Life ambrosial drink , 590</l>
     <l n="591">That soon refreshed him wearied , and repaired</l>
     <l n="592">What hunger , if aught hunger , had impaired ,</l>
     <l n="593">Or thirst ; and , as he fed , Angelic quires</l>
     <l n="594">Sung heavenly anthems of his victory</l>
     <l n="595">Over temptation and the Tempter proud :—</l>
     <l n="596">“ True Image of the Father , whether throned</l>
     <l n="597">In the bosom of bliss , and light of light</l>
     <l n="598">Conceiving , or , remote from Heaven , enshrined</l>
     <l n="599">In fleshly tabernacle and human form ,</l>
     <l n="600">Wandering the wilderness — whatever place , 600</l>
     <l n="601">Habit , or state , or motion , still expressing</l>
     <l n="602">The Son of God , with Godlike force endued</l>
     <l n="603">Against the attempter of thy Father 's throne</l>
     <l n="604">And thief of Paradise ! Him long of old</l>
     <l n="605">Thou didst debel , and down from Heaven cast</l>
     <l n="606">With all his army ; now thou hast avenged</l>
     <l n="607">Supplanted Adam , and , by vanquishing</l>
     <l n="608">Temptation , hast regained lost Paradise ,</l>
     <l n="609">And frustrated the conquest fraudulent .</l>
     <l n="610">He never more henceforth will dare set foot 610</l>
     <l n="611">In paradise to tempt ; his snares are broke .</l>
     <l n="612">For , though that seat of earthly bliss be failed ,</l>
     <l n="613">A fairer Paradise is founded now</l>
     <l n="614">For Adam and his chosen sons , whom thou ,</l>
     <l n="615">A Saviour , art come down to reinstall ;</l>
     <l n="616">Where they shall dwell secure , when time shall be ,</l>
     <l n="617">Of tempter and temptation without fear .</l>
     <l n="618">But thou , Infernal Serpent ! shalt not long</l>
     <l n="619">Rule in the clouds . Like an autumnal star ,</l>
     <l n="620">Or lightning , thou shalt fall from Heaven , trod down 620</l>
     <l n="621">Under his feet . For proof , ere this thou feel'st</l>
     <l n="622">Thy wound ( yet not thy last and deadliest wound )</l>
     <l n="623">By this repulse received , and hold'st in Hell</l>
     <l n="624">No triumph ; in all her gates Abaddon rues</l>
     <l n="625">Thy bold attempt . Hereafter learn with awe</l>
     <l n="626">To dread the Son of God . He , all unarmed ,</l>
     <l n="627">Shall chase thee , with the terror of his voice ,</l>
     <l n="628">From thy demoniac holds , possession foul —</l>
     <l n="629">Thee and thy legions ; yelling they shall fly ,</l>
     <l n="630">And beg to hide them in a herd of swine , 630</l>
