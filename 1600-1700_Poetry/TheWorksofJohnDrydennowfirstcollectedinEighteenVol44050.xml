   <p>EPISTLES .</p>
   <p>EPISTLE THE FIRST ,</p>
   <p>TO HIS FRIEND</p>
   <p>JOHN HODDESDON ,</p>
   <p>ON HIS</p>
   <p>DIVINE EPIGRAMS .</p>
   <p>These verses were rescued from oblivion by Mr Malone , having escaped the notice of Dryden 's former editors . I have disposed them among the Epistles , that being the title which the author seems usually to have given to those copies of verses , which he sent to his friends upon their publications , and which , according to the custom of the time , were prefixed to the works to which they related . They form the second of our author 's attempts at poetry hitherto discovered , the “ Elegy upon Lord Hastings ” being the first . The lines are distinguished by the hard and rugged versification , and strained conceit , which characterised English poetry before the Restoration . The title of Hoddesdon 's book is a sufficiently odd one : “ Sion and Parnassus , or Epigrams on several Texts of the Old and New Testaments , ” 8vo , 1650 . Dryden was then a student in Trinity College , Cambridge , and about eighteen years old . The nature of the volume which called forth his poetical approbation , may lead us to suppose , that , at this time , he retained the puritanical principles in which he was doubtless educated . The verses are subscribed , J. Dryden of Trin . C .</p>

    <head>EPISTLE THE FIRST .</head>
     <l n="1">Thou hast inspired me with thy soul , and I ,</l>
     <l n="2">Who ne'er before could ken of poetry ,</l>
     <l n="3">Am grown so good proficient , I can lend</l>
     <l n="4">A line in commendation of my friend .</l>
     <l n="5">Yet ‘ tis but of the second hand ; if ought</l>
     <l n="6">There be in this , ‘ tis from thy fancy brought .</l>
     <l n="7">Good thief , who dar'st , Prometheus-like , aspire ,</l>
     <l n="8">And fill thy poems with celestial fire ;</l>
     <l n="9">Enlivened by these sparks divine , their rays</l>
     <l n="10">Add a bright lustre to thy crown of bays .</l>
     <l n="11">Young eaglet , who thy nest thus soon forsook ,</l>
     <l n="12">So lofty and divine a course hast took ,</l>
     <l n="13">As all admire , before the down begin</l>
     <l n="14">To peep , as yet , upon thy smoother chin ;</l>
     <l n="15">And , making heaven thy aim , hast had the grace</l>
     <l n="16">To look the sun of righteousness i'the face .</l>
     <l n="17">What may we hope , if thou goest on thus fast ?</l>
     <l n="18">Scriptures at first , enthusiams at last !</l>
     <l n="19">Thou hast commenced , betimes , a saint ; go on ,</l>
     <l n="20">Mingling diviner streams with Helicon ,</l>
     <l n="21">That they who view what epigrams here be ,</l>
     <l n="22">May learn to make like , in just praise of thee .—</l>
     <l n="23">Reader , I 've done , nor longer will withhold</l>
     <l n="24">Thy greedy eyes ; looking on this pure gold ,</l>
     <l n="25">Thou'lt know adulterate copper ; which , like this ,</l>
     <l n="26">Will only serve to be a foil to his .</l>

   <p>EPISTLE THE SECOND .</p>
   <p>TO MY HONOURED FRIEND</p>
   <p>SIR ROBERT HOWARD ,</p>
   <p>ON HIS</p>
   <p>EXCELLENT POEMS .</p>
   <p>This epistle was prefixed to Sir Robert Howard 's poems , printed for Herringman , 12mo , 1660 , and entered in the Stationers ’ books on 16th April that year . It was probably written about the commencement of Dryden 's intimacy with the author , whose sister he afterwards married . Sir Robert Howard , son to the Earl of Berkshire , a man of quality , a wit , and a cavalier , was able to extend effectual patronage to a rising author ; and so willing to do it , that he is even said to have received Dryden into his own house . These lines , therefore , make part of Dryden 's grateful acknowledgments , of which more may be found in the prefatory letter to the “ Annus Mirabilis , ” addressed to Sir Robert Howard .<span corresp="#note1" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>The friendship of the brother poets was afterwards suspended for some time , in consequence of Sir Robert 's strictures on the “ Essay on Dramatic Poetry , ” and Dryden 's contemptuous refutation of his criticism . But there is reason to believe , that this interval of coldness was of short duration ; and that , if the warmth of their original intimacy was never renewed , they resumed the usual kindly intercourse of relations and friends .</p>
   <p>The epistle itself is earlier in date than the poem called “ Astrea Redux , ” which was probably not published till the summer of 1660 was somewhat advanced . This copy of verses , therefore , is the first avowed production of our author after the Restoration , and may rank , in place and merit , with “ Astrea Redux , ” the “ Poem on the Coronation , ” and the “ Address to the Chancellor . ” There is the same anxiety to turn and point every sentence , and the same tendency to extravagant and unnatural conceit . Yet it is sometimes difficult to avoid admiring the strength of the author 's mind , even when employed in wresting ideas the wrong way . It is remarkable , also , that Dryden ventures to praise the verses of his patron , on account of that absence of extravagant metaphor , and that sobriety of poetic composition , for which , to judge by his own immediate practice , he ought rather to have censured them .</p>
   <p>Those who may be induced to peruse the works of Sir Robert Howard , by the high commendation here bestowed upon them , will have more reason to praise the gratitude of our author , than the justice of his panegyric . They are productions of a most freezing mediocrity .</p>
   <note xml:id="note1" place="bottom" n="1">“ I am so many ways obliged to you , and so little able to return your favours , that , like those who owe too much , I can only live by getting farther into your debt . You have not only been careful of my fortune , which was the effect of your nobleness , but you have been solicitous of my reputation , which is that of your kindness . ”</note>

    <head>EPISTLE THE SECOND .</head>
     <l n="1">As there is music uninformed by art</l>
     <l n="2">In those wild notes , which , with a merry heart ,</l>
     <l n="3">The birds in unfrequented shades express ,</l>
     <l n="4">Who , better taught at home , yet please us less ;</l>
     <l n="5">So in your verse a native sweetness dwells ,</l>
     <l n="6">Which shames composure ,<span corresp="#note2" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>and its art excells .</l>
     <l n="7">Singing no more can your soft numbers grace ,</l>
     <l n="8">Than paint adds charms unto a beauteous face .<span corresp="#note3" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span></l>
     <l n="9">Yet as when mighty rivers gently creep ,</l>
     <l n="10">Their even calmness does suppose them deep ,</l>
     <l n="11">Such is your muse : no metaphor swelled high</l>
     <l n="12">With dangerous boldness lifts her to the sky :</l>
     <l n="13">Those mounting fancies , when they fall again ,</l>
     <l n="14">Show sand and dirt at bottom do remain .</l>
     <l n="15">So firm a strength , and yet withal so sweet ,</l>
     <l n="16">Did never but in Sampson 's riddle meet .</l>
     <l n="17">‘ Tis strange each line so great a weight should bear ,</l>
     <l n="18">And yet no sign of toil , no sweat appear .</l>
     <l n="19">Either your art hides art , as stoics feign</l>
     <l n="20">Then least to feel , when most they suffer pain ;</l>
     <l n="21">And we , dull souls , admire , but cannot see</l>
     <l n="22">What hidden springs within the engine be :</l>
     <l n="23">Or ‘ tis some happiness , that still pursues</l>
     <l n="24">Each act and motion of your graceful muse .</l>
     <l n="25">Or is it fortune 's work , that in your head</l>
     <l n="26">The curious net that is for fancies spread ,<span corresp="#note4" type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span></l>
     <l n="27">Lets through its meshes every meaner thought ,</l>
     <l n="28">While rich ideas there are only caught ?</l>
     <l n="29">Sure that 's not all ; this is a piece too fair</l>
     <l n="30">To be the child of chance , and not of care .</l>
     <l n="31">No atoms , casually together hurled ,</l>
     <l n="32">Could e'er produce so beautiful a world ;</l>
     <l n="33">Nor dare I such a doctrine here admit ,</l>
     <l n="34">As would destroy the providence of wit .</l>
     <l n="35">‘ Tis your strong genius , then , which does not feel</l>
     <l n="36">Those weights , would make a weaker spirit reel .</l>
     <l n="37">To carry weight , and run so lightly too ,</l>
     <l n="38">Is what alone your Pegasus can do .</l>
     <l n="39">Great Hercules himself could ne'er do more ,</l>
     <l n="40">Than not to feel those heavens and gods he bore .</l>
     <l n="41">Your easier odes , which for delight were penned ,</l>
     <l n="42">Yet our instruction make their second end ;</l>
     <l n="43">We 're both enriched and pleased , like them that woo</l>
     <l n="44">At once a beauty , and a fortune too .</l>
     <l n="45">Of moral knowledge poesy was queen ,</l>
     <l n="46">And still she might , had wanton wits not been ;</l>
     <l n="47">Who , like ill guardians , lived themselves at large ,</l>
     <l n="48">And , not content with that , debauched their charge .</l>
     <l n="49">Like some brave captain , your successful pen</l>
     <l n="50">Restores the exiled to her crown again ;</l>
     <l n="51">And gives us hope , that having seen the days</l>
     <l n="52">When nothing flourished but fanatic bays ,</l>
     <l n="53">All will at length in this opinion rest ,—</l>
     <l n="54">“ A sober prince 's government is best . ”</l>
     <l n="55">This is not all ; your art the way has found</l>
     <l n="56">To make improvement of the richest ground ;</l>
     <l n="57">That soil which those immortal laurels bore ,</l>
     <l n="58">That once the sacred Maro 's temples wore .<span corresp="#note5" type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span></l>
     <l n="59">Eliza 's griefs are so expressed by you ,</l>
     <l n="60">They are too eloquent to have been true .</l>
     <l n="61">Had she so spoke , Æneas had obeyed</l>
     <l n="62">What Dido , rather than what Jove , had said .</l>
     <l n="63">If funeral rites can give a ghost repose ,</l>
     <l n="64">Your muse so justly has discharged those ,</l>
     <l n="65">Eliza 's shade may now its wandering cease ,</l>
     <l n="66">And claim a title to the fields of peace .</l>
     <l n="67">But if Æneas be obliged , no less</l>
     <l n="68">Your kindness great Achilles doth confess ;</l>
     <l n="69">Who , dressed by Statius in too bold a look ,</l>
     <l n="70">Did ill become those virgin robes he took .<span corresp="#note6" type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span></l>
     <l n="71">To understand how much we owe to you ,</l>
     <l n="72">We must your numbers , with your author 's , view :</l>
     <l n="73">Then we shall see his work was lamely rough ,</l>
     <l n="74">Each figure stiff , as if designed in buff ;</l>
     <l n="75">His colours laid so thick on every place ,</l>
     <l n="76">As only showed the paint , but hid the face .</l>
     <l n="77">But , as in perspective , we beauties see ,</l>
     <l n="78">Which in the glass , not in the picture , be ;</l>
     <l n="79">So here our sight obligingly mistakes</l>
     <l n="80">That wealth , which his your bounty only makes .</l>
     <l n="81">Thus vulgar dishes are , by cooks , disguised ,</l>
     <l n="82">More for their dressing than their substance prized .</l>
     <l n="83">Your curious notes<span corresp="#note7" type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>so search into that age ,</l>
     <l n="84">When all was fable but the sacred page ,</l>

     <l n="86">We are at least misled in pleasant way .</l>

   <p>EPISTLE THE THIRD .</p>
   <p>TO MY HONOURED FRIEND</p>
   <p>DR CHARLETON ,</p>
   <p>ON HIS</p>
   <p>LEARNED AND USEFUL WORKS ,</p>
   <p>BUT MORE PARTICULARLY HIS TREATISE OF STONEHENGE ,</p>
   <p>BY HIM RESTORED TO THE TRUE</p>
   <p>FOUNDER .</p>
   <p>WALTER CHARLETON , M. D . was born in 1619 , and educated at Oxford to the profession of physic , in which he became very eminent . During the residence of King Charles I. at Oxford , in the civil wars , Charleton became one of the physicians in ordinary to his majesty . He afterwards settled in London ; and , having a strong bent towards philosophical and historical investigation , became intimate with the most learned and liberal of his profession , particularly with Ent and Harvey . He wrote several treatises in the dark period preceding the Restoration , when , the government being in the hands of swordsmen equally ignorant and fanatical , a less ardent mind would have been discouraged from investigations , attended neither by fame nor profit . These essays were upon physical , philosophical , and moral subjects . After the Restoration , Charleton published the work upon which he is here congratulated by our author . Its full title is , “ CHOREA GIGANTUM , or the most famous antiquity of Great Britain , STONEHENGE , standing on Salisbury Plain , restored to the Danes . By Walter Charleton , M. D ., and Physician in Ordinary to his Majesty . London , 1663 , 4to . ” The opinion which Dr Charleton had formed concerning the origin of this stupendous monument is strengthened by the information which he received from the famous northern antiquary , Olaus Wormius . But it is nevertheless hypothetical , and inconsistent with evidence ; for Stonehenge is expressly mentioned by Nennius , who wrote two hundred years before the arrival of the Danes in Britain . If it be true , which is alleged by some writers , that it was anciently called Stan-Hengist , or , indeed , whether that be true or no , the monument seems likely to have been a Saxon erection , during their days of paganism ; for it is neither mentioned by Cæsar nor Tacitus , who were both likely to have noticed a structure of so remarkable an appearance . Leaving the book to return to the author , I am sorry to add , that this learned man , after being president of the College of Physicians , and thus having attained the highest honours of his profession , in 1691 fell into embarrassed circumstances , which forced him shortly after to take refuge in the island of Jersey . It is uncertain if Dr Charleton ever returned from this sort of exile ; but his death took place in 1707 , at the advanced age of eighty-eight years .</p>
   <p>Dr Charleton 's hypothesis concerning Stonehenge was but indifferently received . It was considered as a personal attack on Inigo Jones , who had formed a much more fantastic opinion upon the subject , conceiving the stones to form a temple , dedicated , by the Romans , to the god Cælus , or Cælum . To the disgrace of that great architect 's accuracy , it seems probable that he never had seen the monument which he attempts to describe ; for he has converted an irregular polygon into a regular hexagon , in order to suit his own system . Dryden sided with Charleton in his theory ; and , in the following elegant epistle , compliments him as having discovered the long-forgotten cause of this strange monument . The verses are not only valuable for the poetry and numbers , but for the accurate and interesting account which they present of the learning and philosophers of the age . It was probably written soon before the publication of Charleton 's book in 1663 . Sir Robert Howard also favoured Dr Charleton with a copy of recommendatory verses . Both poems are prefixed to the second edition of the “ Chorea Gigantum , ” which is the only one I have seen . That of Dryden seems to have been afterwards revised and corrected .</p>

   <p>EPISTLE THE FOURTH .</p>
   <p>TO THE</p>
   <p>LADY CASTLEMAIN ,</p>
   <p>UPON HER ENCOURAGING HIS FIRST PLAY ,</p>
   <p>THE WILD GALLANT ,</p>
   <p>ACTED IN 1662-3 .</p>
   <p>Barbara Villiers , heiress of William Viscount Grandison , in Ireland , and wife of Roger Palmer , Esq ., was the first favourite , who after the Restoration of Charles II . enjoyed the power and consequence of a royal mistress . It is even said , that the king took her from her husband , upon the very day of his landing , and raised him , in compensation , to the rank and title of Earl of Castlemain . The lady herself was created Lady Nonsuch , Countess of Southampton , and finally Duchess of Cleveland . She bore the king three sons and three daughters , and long enjoyed a considerable share of his favour .</p>
   <p>It would seem , that , in 1662-3 , while Lady Castlemain was in the very height of her reign , she extended her patronage to our author , upon his commencing his dramatic career . In the preface to his first play , “ The Wild Gallant , ” he acknowledges , that it met with very indifferent success , and had been condemned by the greater part of the audience . But he adds , “ it was well received at court , and was more than once the divertisement of his majesty by his own command . "[ 20 ] These marks of royal favour were doubtless owing to the intercession of Lady Castlemain . If we can trust the sarcasm thrown out by a contemporary satirist , our author piqued himself more on this light and gallant effusion , than its importance deserved .<span corresp="#note21" type="note_anchor">[ 21 ]</span>The verses abound with sprightly and ingenious turns ; and the conceits , which were the taste of the age , shew to some advantage on such an occasion . There is , however , little propriety in comparing the influence of the royal mistress to the virtue of Cato .</p>

     <l n="1">1677 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ The Rival Queens , or Alexander the Great , ” of Nathaniel Lee , has been always deemed the most capital performance of its unfortunate author . There is nothing throughout the play that is tame or indifferent ; all is either exquisitely good , or extravagantly bombastic , though some passages hover between the sublime and the ludicrous . Addison has justly remarked , that Lee 's “ thoughts are wonderfully suited for tragedy , but frequently lost in such a crowd of words , that it is hard to see the beauty of them . There is infinite fire in his works , but so involved in smoke , that it does not appear in half its lustre . ”</p>
   <p>Lee and our author lived on terms of strict friendship , and wrote , in conjunction , “ Œdipus , ” and the “ Duke of Guise . ” Lee 's madness and confinement in Bedlam are well known ; as also his repartee to a coxcomb , who told him , it was easy to write like a madman :— “ No , ” answered the poet , “ it is not easy to write like a madman , but it is very easy to write like a fool . ” Dryden elegantly apologizes , in the following verses , for the extravagance of his style of poetry . Lee 's death was very melancholy : Being discharged from Bedlam , and returning by night from a tavern , in a state of intoxication , to his lodgings in Duke-street , he fell down somewhere in Clare-Market , and was either killed by a carriage driving over him , or stifled in the snow , which was then deep . Thus died this eminent dramatic poet in the year 1691 , or 1692 , in the 35th year of his age .</p>

In 1671 , he was sent to the Mediterranean with a squadron , to chastise the Algerines . He found seven vessels belonging to these pirates , lying in the bay of Bugia , covered by the fire of a castle and forts , and defended by a boom , drawn across the entrance of the bay , made of yards , top-masts , and cables , buoyed up by casks . Nevertheless , Sir Edward bore into the bay , silenced the forts , and , having broken the boom with his pinnaces , sent in a fire-ship , which effectually destroyed the Algerine squadron ; a blow which was long remembered by these piratical states .</note>
   <p>EPISTLE THE SIXTH .</p>
   <p>TO THE</p>
   <p>EARL OF ROSCOMMON ,</p>
   <p>ON HIS EXCELLENT</p>
   <p>ESSAY ON TRANSLATED VERSE .</p>
   <p>The Earl of Roscommon 's “ Essay on Translated Verse , ” a work which abounds with much excellent criticism , expressed in correct , succinct , and manly language , was first published in 4to , in 1680 : a second edition , corrected and enlarged , appeared in 1684 . To both editions are prefixed the following copy of verses by our author ; and to the second there is also one in Latin by his son Charles Dryden , afterwards translated by Mr Needler .</p>
   <p>The high applause which our author has here and elsewhere<span corresp="#note25" type="note_anchor">[ 25 ]</span>bestowed on the “ Essay on Translated Verse , ” is censured by Dr Johnson , as unmerited and exaggerated . But while something is allowed for the partiality of a friend , and the zeal of a panegyrist , it must also be remembered , that the rules of criticism , now so well known as to be even trite and hackneyed , were then almost new to the literary world , and that translation was but then beginning to be emancipated from the fetters of verbal and literal versions . But Johnson elsewhere does Roscommon more justice , where he acknowledges , that “ he improved taste , if he did not enlarge knowledge , and may be numbered among the benefactors of English literature . ”</p>
   <p>Dryden has testified , in several places of his works , that he loved and honoured Roscommon ; particularly by inscribing and applying to him his version of the Third Ode of the First Book of Horace .<span corresp="#note26" type="note_anchor">[ 26 ]</span>Roscommon repaid these favours by a copy of verses addressed to Dryden on the “ Religio Laici .

   <p>EPISTLE THE EIGHTH .</p>
   <p>TO MY FRIEND ,</p>
   <p>MR J. NORTHLEIGH ,</p>
   <p>AUTHOR OF</p>
   <p>THE PARALLEL ;</p>
   <p>ON HIS</p>
   <p>TRIUMPH OF THE BRITISH MONARCHY .</p>
   <p>These verses have been recovered by Mr Malone , and are transferred , from his life of Dryden , into the present collection of his works . John Northleigh was by profession a student of law , though he afterwards became a physician ; and was in politics a keen Tory . He wrote “ The Parallel , or the new specious Association , an old rebellious Covenant , closing with a disparity between a true Patriot and a factious Associator . ” London , 1682 , folio . This work was anonymous ; but attracted so much applause among the High-churchmen , that , according to Wood , Dr Lawrence Womack called the author “ an excellent person , whose name his own modesty , or prudence , as well as the iniquity of the times , keeps from us . ”</p>
   <p>Proceeding in the same track of politics , Northleigh published two pamphlets on the side of the Tories , in the dispute between the petitioners and abhorrers ; and finally produced , “ The Triumph of our Monarchy , over the Plots and Principles of our Rebels and Republicans , being remarks on their most eminent Libels . London , 1685 . ” This last publication called forth the following lines from our author .</p>
   <p>Northleigh was the son of a Hamburgh merchant , and born in that city . He became a student in Exeter College , in 1674 , aged 17 years ; and was , it appears , studying law in the Inner Temple in 1685 , when his book was published . He was then , consequently , about 28 years old ; so that his genius was not peculiarly premature , notwithstanding our author 's compliment . He afterwards took a medical degree at Cambridge , and practised physic at Exeter .— WOOD , Athenæ Oxon . Vol . II . p. 962 .</p>
   <p>These verses , like the address to Hoddesdon , are ranked among the Epistles , because Dryden gave that title to other recommendatory verses of the same nature .</p>

   <p>EPISTLE THE NINTH .</p>
   <p>A</p>
   <p>LETTER</p>
   <p>TO</p>
   <p>SIR GEORGE ETHEREGE .</p>
   <p>Sir George Etherege , as a lively and witty companion , a smooth sonnetteer , and an excellent writer of comedy , was in high reputation in the seventeenth century . He lived on terms of intimacy with the men of genius , and with those of rank , at the court of Charles the Second , and appears to have been particularly acquainted with Dryden . Etherege enjoyed in a particular manner the favour of Queen Mary of Este , through whose influence he was sent envoy to Hamburgh , and afterwards became resident minister at Ratisbon . In this situation , he did not cease to interest himself in the progress of English literature ; and we have several of his letters , both in prose and verse , written with great wit and vivacity , to the Duke of Buckingham , and other persons of wit and honour at the court of London . Among others , he wrote an epistle in verse to the Earl of Middleton , who engaged Dryden to return the following answer to it . As Sir George 's verses are lively and pleasing , I have prefixed them to Dryden 's epistle . Both pieces , with a second letter from Etherege to Middleton , appeared in Dryden 's Miscellanies .</p>
   <p>Our poet 's epistle to Sir George Etherege affords an example how easily Dryden could adapt his poetry to the style which the moment required ; since , although this is the only instance in which he has used the verse of eight syllables , it flows as easily from his pen as if he had never written in another measure . This is the more remarkable , as , in the “ Essay on Satire , ” Dryden speaks very contemptuously of the eight syllable , or Hudibrastic measure , and the ornaments proper to it , as a little instrument , unworthy the use of a great master .<span corresp="#note33" type="note_anchor">[ 33 ]</span>Here , however , he happily retorts upon the witty knight , with his own weapons of gallant and courtly ridicule , and acquits himself , as well in the light arms of a polite and fashionable courtier , as when he wields the trenchant brand of his own keen satire .</p>
   <p>Our author had formerly favoured Sir George Etherege with an excellent epilogue to his popular play , called “ The Man of Mode , ” acted in 1676 , and he occasionally speaks of him in his writings with great respect . The date of this epistle is not easily ascertained . From a letter of Etherege to the Duke of Buckingham , it appears , that Sir George was at Ratisbon when Dryden was engaged in his controversial poetry ;<span corresp="#note34" type="note_anchor">[ 34 ]</span>but whether that letter be previous or subsequent to the epistle to the Earl of Middleton , seems uncertain .</p>
   <p>Considering the high reputation which Sir George Etherege enjoyed , and the figure which he made as a courtier and a man of letters , it is humbling to add , that we have no accurate information concerning the time or manner of his death . It seems certain , that he never returned from the Continent ; but it is dubious , whether , according to one report , he followed the fortunes of King James , and resided with him at the court of St Germains till his death , or whether , as others have said , that event was occasioned by his falling down the stairs of his own house at Ratisbon , when , after drinking freely with a large company , he was attempting to do the honours of their retreat . From the date of the letter to the Duke of Buckingham , 21st October , 1689 , it is plain he was then at Ratisbon ; and it is somewhat singular , that he appears to have retained his official situation of Resident , though nearly twelve months had elapsed since the Revolution . This seems to give countenance to the latter report of his having died at Ratisbon . The date of that event was probably about 1694 .</p>

Dryden alludes to the commencement of Etherege 's epistle to Middleton , in which he mentions having gone three degrees northward , London being 41 ° 15 ´ N.

   <note xml:id="note42" place="bottom" n="42">Etherege has been pleased to confirm our author 's opinion of the German jollity , and his own inclination to softer pleasures , by the following passage of a letter to the Duke of Buckingham .</note>
   <p>“ I find that to this day , they ( i. e . the Germans ) make good the observation that Tacitus made of their ancestors ; I mean , that their affairs ( let them be never so serious and pressing ) never put a stop to good eating and drinking , and that they debate their weightiest negociations over their cups .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Tis true , they carry this humour by much too far for one of my complexion ; for which reason I decline appearing among them , but when my master 's concerns make it necessary for me to come to their assemblies : They are , indeed , a free-hearted open sort of gentlemen that compose the Diet , without reserve , affectation , and artifice ; but they are such unmerciful plyers of the bottle , so wholly given up to what our sots call good-fellowship , that ‘ tis as great a constraint upon my nature to sit out a night 's entertainment with them , as it would be to hear half a score long-winded Presbyterian divines cant successively one after another .</p>
   <p>“ To unbosom myself frankly and freely to your grace , I always looked upon drunkenness to be an unpardonable crime in a young fellow , who , without any of these foreign helps , has fire enough in his veins to enable him to do justice to Cælia whenever she demands a tribute from him . In a middle-aged man , I consider the bottle only as subservient to the nobler pleasures of love ; and he that would suffer himself to be so far infatuated by it , as to neglect the pursuit of a more agreeable game , I think deserves no quarter from the ladies : In old age , indeed , when it is convenient very often to forget and even steal from ourselves , I am of opinion , that a little drunkenness , discreetly used , may as well contribute to our health of body as tranquillity of soul .</p>
   <p>“ Thus I have given your grace a short system of my morals and belief in these affairs . But the gentlemen of this country go upon a quite different scheme of pleasure ; the best furniture of their parlours , instead of innocent china , are tall overgrown rummers ; and they take more care to enlarge their cellars , than their patrimonial estates . In short , drinking is the hereditary sin of this country ; and that hero of a deputy here , that can demolish , at one sitting , the rest of his brother envoys , is mentioned with as much applause as the Duke of Lorain for his noble exploits against the Turks , and may claim a statue , erected at the public expence , in any town in Germany .</p>
   <p>“ Judge , then , my lord , whether a person of my sober principles , and one that only uses wine ( as the wiser sort of Roman Catholics do images ,) to raise up my imagination to something more exalted , and not to terminate my worship upon it , must not be reduced to very mortifying circumstances in this place ; where I cannot pretend to enjoy conversation , without practising that vice that directly ruins it . ” ]</p>
   <note xml:id="note43" place="bottom" n="43">This is the only mention that our author makes of the “ Rehearsal ” in poetry : In prose he twice notices that satirical farce with some contempt . The length of time which the Duke spent upon it , or at least which elapsed between the first concoction and the representation , is mentioned by Duke in his character of Villerius :</note>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">But with play-houses , wars , immortal wars ,</l>
     <l n="2">He waged , and ten years rage produced a farce .</l>
     <l n="3">As many rolling years he did employ , }</l>
     <l n="4">And hands almost as many , to destroy }</l>
     <l n="5">Heroic rhyme , as Greece to ruin Troy . }</l>
     <l n="6">Once more , says fame , for battle he prepares ,</l>
     <l n="7">And threatens rhymers with a second farce ;</l>
     <l n="8">But if as long for this as that we stay ,</l>
     <l n="9">He 'll finish Cliveden sooner than his play .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The last line alludes to the magnificent structure at Cliveden , which Buckingham planned , but never completed . Another satirist has the same idea :</p>
   <p>I come to his farce , which must needs well be done , } For Troy was no longer before it was won , } Since ‘ tis more than ten years since this farce was begun . } ]</p>
   <p>EPISTLE THE TENTH .</p>
   <p>TO</p>
   <p>MR SOUTHERNE ,</p>
   <p>ON HIS COMEDY</p>
   <p>CALLED</p>
   <p>THE WIVES ’ EXCUSE ,</p>
   <p>ACTED IN 1692 .</p>
   <p>SOUTHERNE ,— well known to the present age as a tragic writer , for his Isabella has been ranked among the first-rate parts of our inimitable Siddons ,— was also distinguished by his contemporaries as a successful candidate for the honours of the comic muse . Two of his comedies , “ The Mother in Fashion , ” and “ Sir Anthony Love , ” had been represented with success , when , in 1692 , the “ Wives ’ Excuse , or Cuckolds make Themselves , ” was brought forward . The tone of that piece approaches what we now call genteel comedy : but , whether owing to the flatness into which such plays are apt to slide , for want of the vis comica which enlivens the more animated , though coarser , effusions of the lower comedy , or to some strokes of satire directed against music meetings , and other places of fashionable resort , “ The Wives ’ Excuse ” was unfortunate in the representation . The author , in the dedication of the printed play ,<span corresp="#note44" type="note_anchor">[ 44 ]</span>has hinted at the latter cause as that of his defeat ; and vindicates himself from the idea of reflecting upon music meetings , or any other resort of the people of fashion , by urging , that although a billet doux is represented as being there delivered , “ such a thing has been done before now in a church , without the place being thought the worse of . ” But Southerne consoles himself for the disapprobation of the audience with the favour of Dryden , who , says he , “ speaking of this play , has publicly said , the town was kind to ‘ Sir Anthony Love ; ’ I needed them only to be just to this . ” And , after mentioning that Dryden had intrusted to him , upon the credit of this play , the task of completing “ Cleomenes ,"[ 45 ] he triumphantly adds ,— “ If modesty be sometimes a weakness , what I say can hardly be a crime : in a fair English trial , both parties are allowed to be heard ; and without this vanity of mentioning Mr Dryden , I had lost the best evidence of my cause . ” Dryden , not satisfied with a verbal exertion of his patronage , consoled his friend under his discomfiture , by addressing to him the following Epistle , in which his failure is ascribed to the taste for bustling intrigue , and for low and farcical humour .</p>
   <p>It is not the Editor 's business to trace Southerne 's life , or poetical career . He was born in the county of Dublin , in 1659 ; and produced , in his twenty-third year , the tragedy of “ The Loyal Brother , ” which Dryden honoured with a prologue . On this occasion , Southerne 's acquaintance with our bard took place , under the whimsical circumstances mentioned Vol . X. p. 372 . The aged bard furnished also a prologue to Southerne 's “ Disappointment , or Mother in Fashion ; ” and as he had repeatedly ushered him to success , he presented him with the following lines to console him under disappointment . The poets appear to have continued on the most friendly terms until Dryden 's death . Southerne survived him many years , and lived to be praised by the rising generation of a second century , for mildness of manners , and that cheerful and amiable disposition , which rarely is found in old age , unless from the happy union of a body at ease , and a conscience void of offence . When this dramatist was sixty-five , his last play , called “ Money the Mistress , ” was acted , with a prologue by Welsted , containing the following beautiful lines :[ 46 ]</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">To you , ye fair , for patronage he sues ;</l>
     <l n="2">O last defend , who first inspired his muse !</l>
     <l n="3">In your soft service he has past his days ,</l>
     <l n="4">And gloried to be born for woman 's praise :</l>
     <l n="5">Deprest at length , and in your cause decayed ,</l>
     <l n="6">The good old man to beauty bends for aid ;</l>
     <l n="7">That beauty , he has taught so oft to moan ! }</l>
     <l n="8">That ne'er let Imoinda weep alone , }</l>
     <l n="9">And made his Isabella 's griefs its own ! }</l>
     <l n="10">Ere you arose to life , ye blooming train ;</l>
     <l n="11">Ere time brought forth our pleasure and our pain ;</l>
     <l n="12">He melted hearts , to monarchs ’ vows denied ,</l>
     <l n="13">And softened to distress unconquered pride :</l>
     <l n="14">O ! then protect , in his declining years ,</l>
     <l n="15">The man , that filled your mother 's eyes with tears !</l>
     <l n="16">The last of Charles 's bards ! The living name ,</l>
     <l n="17">That rose , in that Augustan age , to fame !</l>
     <l n="18">And you , his brother authors , bravely dare</l>
     <l n="19">To join to-night the squadrons of the fair ;</l>
     <l n="20">With zeal protect your veteran writer 's page ,</l>
     <l n="21">And save the drama 's father , in his age :</l>
     <l n="22">Nor let the wreath from his grey head be torn ,</l>
     <l n="23">For half a century with honour worn !</l>
     <l n="24">His merits let your tribe to mind recal ;</l>

   </lg>
   <p>Southerne , on his eighty-first birth day , was complimented with a copy of verses by Pope ; and on 26th May , 1746 , he died at the advanced age of eighty-five and upwards .</p>

In some of his low characters , that became it , he had a shuffling shamble in his gait , with so contented an ignorance in his aspect , and an aukward absurdity in his gesture , that , had you not known him , you could not have believed , that naturally he could have had a grain of common sense . ” Our author insinuates , that the audience had been so accustomed to the presence of this facetious actor , that they could not tolerate a play where his low humour was excluded .</note>

    <head>TO</head>
    <head>HENRY HIGDEN , ESQ .</head>
    <head>ON HIS TRANSLATION OF</head>
    <head>THE TENTH SATIRE OF JUVENAL .</head>
    <head>HENRY HIGDEN was a member of the honourable society of the Middle Temple , and during the reigns of James II . and William III . held some rank among the wits of the age . He wrote a play called “ Sir Noisy Parrot , or the Wary Widow , ” represented in 1693 , which seems to have been most effectually damned ; for in the preface the author complains , that “ the theatre was by faction transformed into a bear-garden , hissing , mimicking , ridiculing , and cat-calling . ” I mention this circumstance , because amongst the poetical friends who hastened to condole with Mr Higden on the bad success of his piece , there is one who attributes it to the influence of our author over the inferior wits at Will 's coffee-house .<span corresp="#note50" type="note_anchor">[ 50 ]</span>But it seems more generally admitted , as the cause of the downfall of the “ Wary Widow , ” that the author being a man of a convivial temper , had introduced too great a display of good eating and drinking into his piece ; and that the actors , although Mr Higden complains of their general negligence , entered into these convivial scenes with great zeal , and became finally incapable of proceeding in their parts .<span corresp="#note51" type="note_anchor">[ 51 ]</span>The prologue was written by Sir Charles Sedley , in which the following lines seem to be levelled at Dryden 's critical prefaces :</head>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">If the admirers of Dryden were active in the condemnation of Higden 's</l>
     <l n="14">play , the offence probably lay in these verses .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>It seems likely that Higden 's translation , of the Tenth Satire of Juvenal , which I have never seen , was printed before Dryden published his own version , in 1693 ; consequently , before the damnation of the “ Wary Widow , ” acted in the same year , which seems to have been attended with a quarrel between Dryden and the author . It is therefore very probable , that this Epistle should have stood earlier in the arrangement : but , having no positive evidence , the Editor has not disturbed the former order .</p>

   <p>EPISTLE THE TWELFTH .</p>
   <p>TO MY DEAR FRIEND</p>
   <p>MR CONGREVE ,</p>
   <p>ON HIS COMEDY</p>
   <p>CALLED</p>
   <p>THE DOUBLE DEALER .</p>
   <p>This admirable Epistle is addressed to Congreve , whose rising genius had early attracted our author 's attention and patronage . When Congreve was about to bring out “ The Old Bachelor , ” the manuscript was put by Southerne into Dryden 's hands , who declared , that he had never seen such a first play , and bestowed considerable pains in adapting it to the stage . It was received with the most unbounded approbation . “ The Double Dealer ” was acted in November 1693 , but without that universal applause which attended “ The Old Bachelor . ” The plot was perhaps too serious , and the villainy of Maskwell too black and hateful for comedy . It was the opinion too of Dryden , that the fashionable world felt the satire too keenly .<span corresp="#note54" type="note_anchor">[ 54 ]</span>The play , however , cannot be said to have failed ; for it rose by degrees against opposition . The epistle is one of the most elegant and apparently heart-felt effusions of friendship , that our language boasts ; and the progress of literature from the Restoration , is described as Dryden alone could describe it . A critic of that day , whose candour seems to have been on a level with his taste , has ventured to insinuate , that huffing Dryden , as he prophanely calls our poet , had purposely deluded Congreve into presumption , by his praise , in order that he might lead him to make shipwreck of his popularity . But such malevolent constructions have been always put upon the conduct of men of genius , by the mean jealousy of the vulgar .<span corresp="#note55" type="note_anchor">[ 55 ]</span></p>
   <note xml:id="note54" place="bottom" n="54">Mr Malone quotes part of a letter from Dryden on the subject of “ The Double Dealer , ” and his own tragi-comedy of “ Love Triumphant . ” It is addressed to Mr Walsh , and runs thus :</note>
   <p>“ Congreve 's ‘ Double Dealer ’ is much censured by the greater part of the town , and is defended only by the best judges , who , you know , are commonly the fewest . Yet it gains ground daily , and has already been acted eight times . The women think he has exposed ——; and the gentlemen are offended with him for the discovery of their follies , and the way of their intrigue under the notions of friendship to their ladies ’ husbands .</p>
   <p>“ I am afraid you discover not your own opinion concerning my irregular use of tragi-comedy , in my doppia favola . I will never defend that practice , for I know it distracts the hearers ; but know withal , that it has hitherto pleased them for the sake of variety , and for the particular taste which they have to low comedy . ” ]</p>
   <note xml:id="note55" place="bottom" n="55">“ The first that was acted was Mr Congreve 's , called ‘ The Double Dealer . ’ It has fared with that play , as it generally does with beauties officiously cried up ; the mighty expectation which was raised of it made it sink , even beneath its own merit . The character of the Double Dealer is artfully writ ; but the action being but single , and confined within the rules of true comedy , it could not please the generality of our audience , who relish nothing but variety , and think any thing dull and heavy which does not border upon farce . The critics were severe upon this play , which gave the author occasion to lash them in his epistle dedicatory , in so defying or hectoring a style , that it was counted rude even by his best friends ; so that ‘ tis generally thought he has done his business , and lost himself ; a thing he owes to Mr Dryden 's treacherous friendship , who , being jealous of the applause he had got by his ‘ Old Bachelor , ’ deluded him into a foolish imitation of his own way of writing angry prefaces . ” — See MALONE 'S History of the English Stage , prefaced to Shakespeare 's Plays .</note>

   <note xml:id="note56" place="bottom" n="56">Shadwell , who , at the Revolution , was promoted to Dryden 's posts of poet-laureat , and royal historiographer , died in 1692 : was succeeded in his office of laureat by Nahum Tate , and in that of historiographer by Thomas Rymer . Our author was at present on bad terms with Rymer ; to whom , not to Tate , he applies the sarcastic title of Tom the Second . Yet his old co-adjutor , Nahum , is probably included in the warning , that they should not mistake the Earl of Dorset 's charity for the recompense of their own merit . We have often remarked , that the Earl of Dorset , although , as lord-chamberlain , he was obliged to dispose of Dryden 's offices to persons less politically obnoxious , bestowed at the same time such marks of generosity on the abdicated laureat , that Dryden , here , and elsewhere , honours him with the title of “ his patron . ” For the quarrel between Rymer and Dryden , see the Introduction to the “ Translations from Ovid 's Metamorphoses , ” Vol . XII . p. 46 . Rymer was an useful antiquary , as his edition of the Fœdera bears witness ; but he was a miserable critic , and a worse poet . His tragedy of “ Edgar ” is probably alluded to in the Epistle as one of the productions of his reign . It was printed in 1678 ; but appeared under the new title of “ The English Monarch , ” in 1691 .</note>

   <p>EPISTLE THE THIRTEENTH .</p>
   <p>TO</p>
   <p>MR GRANVILLE ,</p>
   <p>ON HIS EXCELLENT TRAGEDY ,</p>
   <p>CALLED</p>
   <p>HEROIC LOVE .</p>
   <p>George Granville , afterwards Lord Lansdowne of Biddiford , was distinguished , by the friendship of Dryden and Pope , from the mob of gentlemen who wrote with ease . He copied Waller , a model perhaps chosen from a judicious consideration of his own powers . His best piece is his “ Essay on unnatural Flights in Poetry , ” in which he elegantly apologizes for Dryden having suffered his judgment to be swayed by a wild audience . Granville 's play of the “ Heroic Love , or the cruel Separation , ” was acted in 1698 with great applause . It is a mythological drama on the love of Agamemnon and Briseis ; and this being said , it is hardly necessary to add , that it now scarcely bears reading . Granville 's unshaken attachment to Tory principles , as well as his excellent private character , probably gained him favour in our poet 's eyes . Lord Lansdowne ( for such became Granville 's title when Queen Anne created twelve peers to secure a majority to ministry in the House of Lords ) died on the 30th January , 1735 .</p>

     <l n="15">Thine be the laurel , then ; thy blooming age</l>

     <l n="21">And , in despair their empty pit to fill ,</l>
     <l n="22">Set up some foreign monster in a bill .</l>
     <l n="23">Thus they jog on , still tricking , never thriving ,</l>

     <l n="25">Our sense is nonsense , through their pipes conveyed ;</l>

     <l n="35">Their setting-sun still shoots a glimmering ray ,</l>
     <l n="36">Like ancient Rome , majestic in decay ;</l>
     <l n="37">And better gleanings their worn soil can boast ,</l>

   <note xml:id="note59" place="bottom" n="59">These sarcasms are levelled at the players ; one of whom , George Powel , took it upon him to retort in the following very singular strain of effrontery , which Mr Malone transfers from the preface of a tragedy ; called “ The Fatal Discovery , or Love in Ruins , ” published in 4to , 1698 .</note>
   <p>“ Here I am afraid he makes but a coarse compliment , when this great wit , with his treacherous memory , forgets , that he had given away his laurels upon record twice before , viz . once to Mr Congreve , and another time to Mr Southerne . Pr'ythee , old Œdipus , expound this mystery ! Dost thou set up thy transubstantiation miracle in the donation of thy idol bays , that thou hast them fresh , new , and whole , to give them three times over ?</p>
   <p>“ For the most mortal stroke at us , he charges us with downright murdering of plays , which we call reviving . I will not derogate from the merit of those senior actors of both sexes , of the other house , that shine in their several perfections , in whose lavish praises he is so highly transported ; but , at the same time , he makes himself but an arbitrary judge on our side , to condemn unheard , and that under no less a conviction than murder , when I cannot learn , for a fair judgment upon us , that his reverend crutches have ever brought him within our doors since the division of the companies<span type="note_anchor">[ 1695 ]</span>. ‘ Tis true , I think , we have revived some pieces of Dryden , as his “ Sebastian , ” “ Maiden Queen , ” “ Marriage A-la-Mode , ” “ King Arthur , ” &amp; c. But here let us be tried by a Christian jury , the audience , and not receive the bow-string from his Mahometan Grand Signiorship . ‘ Tis true , his more particular pique against us , as he has declared himself , is in relation to our reviving his “ Almanzor . ” There , indeed , he has reason to be angry for our waking that sleepy dowdy , and exposing his nonsense , not ours ; and if that dish did not please him , we have a Scotch proverb for our justification , viz . ‘ twas rotten roasted , because , &amp; c. and the world must expect , ‘ twas very hard crutching up what Hart and Mohun before us could not prop . I confess , he is a little severe , when he will allow our best performance to bear no better fruit than a crab vintage . Indeed , if we young actors spoke but half as sourly as his old gall scribbles , we should be crab all over . ” ]</p>
   <p>EPISTLE THE FOURTEENTH .</p>
   <p>TO MY FRIEND</p>
   <p>MR MOTTEUX ,</p>
   <p>ON HIS TRAGEDY</p>
   <p>CALLED</p>
   <p>BEAUTY IN DISTRESS ,</p>
   <p>PUBLISHED IN 1698 .</p>
   <p>Peter Anthony Motteux was a French Huguenot , born at Rohan , in Normandy , in l660 . He emigrated upon the revocation of the edict of Nantz ; and having friends in England of opulence and respectability , he became a merchant and bookseller of some eminence ; besides enjoying a place in the Post-office , to which his skill as a linguist recommended him . This must have been considerable , if we judge by his proficiency in the language of England , certainly not the most easy to be commanded by a foreigner . Nevertheless , Motteux understood it so completely , as not only to write many occasional pieces of English poetry , but to execute a very good translation of “ Don Quixote , ” and compose no less than fifteen plays , several of which were very well received . He also conducted the “ Gentleman 's Journal . ” On the 19th February , 1717-18 , this author was found dead in a house of bad fame , in the parish of St Clement Danes , not without suspicion of murder .</p>
   <p>Motteux appears to have enjoyed the countenance of Dryden , who , in the following verses , consoles him under the censure of those who imputed to his play of “ Beauty in Distress ” an irregularity of plot , and complication of incident . But the preliminary and more important part of the verses regards Jeremy Collier 's violent attack upon the dramatic authors of the age for immorality and indecency . To this charge , our author , on this as on other occasions , seems to plead guilty , while he deprecates the virulence , and sometimes unfair severity of his adversary . The reader may compare the poetical defence here set up with that in the prose dedication to the “ Fables , ” and he will find in both the same grumbling , though subdued , acquiescence under the chastisement of the moralist ; the poet much resembling an over-matched general , who is unwilling to surrender , though conscious of his inability to make an effectual resistance .

   <p>EPISTLE THE FIFTEENTH .</p>
   <p>TO MY HONOURED KINSMAN</p>
   <p>JOHN DRIDEN ,</p>
   <p>OF</p>
   <p>CHESTERTON , IN THE COUNTY OF</p>
   <p>HUNTINGDON , ESQ .</p>
   <p>The person to whom this epistle is addressed was Dryden 's first cousin ; being the second son of Sir John Driden , elder brother of the poet 's father Erasmus . He derived from his maternal grandfather , Sir Robert Bevile , the valuable estate of Chesterton , near Stilton , where latterly our author frequently visited him , and where it is said he wrote the first four verses of his Virgil with a diamond on a glass pane . The mansion-house is at this time ( spring , 1807 ,) about to be pulled down , and the materials sold . The life of Mr John Driden , for he retained the ancient spelling of the name , seems to have been that of an opulent and respectable country gentleman , more happy , perhaps , in the quiet enjoyment of a large landed property , than his cousin in possession of his brilliant poetical genius . He represented the county of Huntingdon in parliament , in 1690 , and from 1700 till his death in 1707-8 .</p>
   <p>The panegyric of our author is an instance , among a thousand , how genius can gild what it touches ; for the praise of this lofty rhyme , when minutely examined , details the qualities of that very ordinary , though very useful and respectable , character , a wealthy and sensible country squire . “ Just , good , and wise , ” contending neighbours referred their disputes to his decision ; in humble prose , he was an active justice of peace . That he was hospitable , and kept a good pack of hounds , was a fox-hunter while young , and now followed beagles or harriers , that he represented his county , and voted against ministry , sums up his excellencies ; for I will not follow my author , by numbering among them his living and dying a bachelor .<span corresp="#note61" type="note_anchor">[ 61 ]</span>Yet these annals , however simple and vulgar , illuminated by the touch of our author 's pen , shine like the clouds under the influence of a setting sun . The greatest illustration of our author 's genius is , that the praise , though unusually applied , is appropriate , and hardly exaggerated ; we lay down the book , and recollect to how little this laboured character amounts ; and when we resume it , are again hurried away by the magic of the poet . But in this epistle , besides the compliment to his cousin , Dryden had a further intention in view , which was , to illustrate the character of a good English member of Parliament , whom , in conformity with his own prejudice , he represents as inclining to oppose the ministry . It was coincidence in this sentiment which had done much to reconcile Dryden and his cousin ; and thus politics reunited relations , whom political disputes had long parted . At this time we learn from one of our author 's letters , that Mr Dryden of Chesterton , although upon different principles , was in as warm opposition as his cousin could have wished him .<span corresp="#note62" type="note_anchor">[ 62 ]</span>Our poet , however , who had felt the hand of power , did not venture on this portrait without such an explanation to Charles Montague , afterwards Lord Halifax , as he thought sufficient to avert any risk of misconstruction .<span corresp="#note63" type="note_anchor">[ 63 ]</span></p>
   <p>There has not been found any early edition of this epistle separate from the volume of Fables ; of which therefore it probably made an original part , and was first published with them in 1700 . It supplies one instance among many , that the poet 's lamp burned clear to the close of life . It is said that his cousin acknowledged the honour done him by the poet , by a handsome gratuity . The amount has been alleged to be five hundred pounds , which is probably exaggerated . Mr Driden of Chesterton bequeathed that sum to Charles Dryden , the poet 's son , who did not live to profit by the legacy . As the report of the present to Dryden himself depends only on tradition ,<span corresp="#note64" type="note_anchor">[ 64 ]</span>it is possible the two circumstances may have been more or less confounded together .</p>
   <p>The reader may be pleased to see the epitaph of John Driden of Chesterton , which concludes with some lines from this epistle . It is in the church of the village of Chesterton :</p>

   <note xml:id="note68" place="bottom" n="68">In this line , as in the end of the preface to the “ Fables , ” our author classes together “ one Milbourne and one Blackmore . ” The former was a clergyman , and beneficed at Yarmouth . Dryden , in the preface just quoted , insinuates , that he lost his living for writing libels on his parishioners . These passing strokes of satire in the text are amply merited by the virulence of Milbourne 's attack , not only on our author 's poetry , but on his person , and principles political and religious . See a note on the preface to the “ Fables , ” near the end .</note>
   <note xml:id="note69" place="bottom" n="69">Sir Samuel Garth , the ingenious author of the “ Dispensary . ” Although this celebrated wit and physician differed widely from Dryden in politics , being a violent Whig , they seem , nevertheless , to have lived in the most intimate terms . Dryden contributed to Garth 's translation of the “ Metamorphoses ; ” and Sir Samuel had the honour to superintend the funeral of our poet , and to pronounce a Latin oration upon that occasion . Garth 's generosity , here celebrated , consisted in maintaining a Dispensary for issuing advice and medicines gratis to the poor . This was highly disapproved of by the more selfish of his brethren , and their disputes led to Sir Samuel 's humorous poem .</note>
   <note xml:id="note70" place="bottom" n="70">A very bloody war had been recently concluded by the peace of Ryswick , in 1697 . But the country party in Parliament entertained violent suspicions , that King William , whose continental connections they dreaded , intended a speedy renewal of the contest with France . Hence they were jealous of every attempt to maintain any military force ; so that , in 1699 , William saw himself compelled , not only to disband the standing army , but to dismiss his faithful and favourite Dutch guards . The subsequent lines point obliquely at these measures , which were now matter of public discussion . Dryden 's cousin joined in them with many of the Whigs , who were attached to what was called the country-party . As for the poet , his jacobitical principles assented to every thing which could embarrass King William . But , for the reasons which he has assigned in his letter to Lord Montague , our author leaves his opinion concerning the disbanding of the army to be inferred from his panegyric on the navy , and his declamation against the renewal of the war .</note>
   <note xml:id="note71" place="bottom" n="71">Our poet had originally accompanied his praises of the British soldiers with some aspersions on the cowardice of the Dutch , their allies . These he omitted at his cousin 's desire , who deemed them disrespectful to King William . In short , he complains he had corrected his verses so far , that he feared he had purged the spirit out of them ; as Bushby used to whip a boy so long , till he made him a confirmed blockhead .</note>
   <note xml:id="note72" place="bottom" n="72">Sir Robert Bevile , maternal grandfather to John Driden of Chesterton , seems to have been imprisoned for resisting some of Charles I . ' s illegal attempts to raise supplies without the authority of parliament . Perhaps our author now viewed his opposition to the royal will as more excusable than he would have thought it in the reigns of Charles II . or of James II . It is thought , that the hard usage which Sir Robert Bevile met on this score , decided our poet 's uncle , his son-in-law , in his violent attachment to Cromwell .</note>
   <note xml:id="note73" place="bottom" n="73">The reader will perhaps doubt , whether Mr Dryden 's account of his cousin Chesterton 's accomplishments as a justice of peace , fox-hunter , and knight of the shire , even including his prudent abstinence from matrimony , were quite sufficient to justify this classification .</note>
   <p>EPISTLE THE SIXTEENTH .</p>
   <p>TO</p>
   <p>SIR GODFREY KNELLER .</p>
   <p>PRINCIPAL PAINTER TO</p>
   <p>HIS MAJESTY .</p>
   <p>The well-known Sir Godfrey Kneller was a native of Lubec , but settled in London about 1674 . He was a man of genius ; but , according to Walpole , he lessened his reputation , by making it subservient to his fortune . No painter was more distinguished by the great , for ten sovereigns sate to him . What may tend longer to preserve his reputation , no painter ever received more incense from the praise of poets . Dryden , Pope , Addison , Prior , Tickell , Steele , all wrote verses to him in the tone of extravagant eulogy . Those addressed to Kneller by Addison , in which the series of the heathen deities is , with unexampled happiness , made to correspond with that of the British monarchs painted by the artist , are not only the best production of that elegant poet , but of their kind the most felicitous ever written . Sir Godfrey Kneller died 27th November , 1723 .</p>
   <p>Dryden seems to have addressed the following epistle to Sir Godfrey Kneller , as an acknowledgment for the copy of the Chandos ’ portrait of Shakespeare , mentioned in the verses . It would appear that , upon other occasions , Sir Godfrey repaid the tributes of the poets , by the productions of his pencil .</p>
   <p>There is great luxuriance and richness of idea and imagery in the epistle .</p>

    <head>EPISTLE THE SIXTEENTH .</head>
     <l n="1">Once I beheld the fairest of her kind ,</l>
     <l n="2">And still the sweet idea charms my mind :</l>
     <l n="3">True , she was dumb ; for nature gazed so long ,</l>
     <l n="4">Pleased with her work , that she forgot her tongue ;</l>
     <l n="5">But , smiling , said — She still shall gain the prize ;</l>
     <l n="6">I only have transferred it to her eyes .</l>
     <l n="7">Such are thy pictures , Kneller , such thy skill ,</l>
     <l n="8">That nature seems obedient to thy will ;</l>
     <l n="9">Comes out , and meets thy pencil in the draught ,</l>
     <l n="10">Lives there , and wants but words to speak her thought .</l>
     <l n="11">At least thy pictures look a voice ; and we }</l>
     <l n="12">Imagine sounds , deceived to that degree , }</l>
     <l n="13">We think ‘ tis somewhat more than just to see . }</l>
     <l n="14">Shadows are but privations of the light ;</l>
     <l n="15">Yet , when we walk , they shoot before the sight ;</l>
     <l n="16">With us approach , retire , arise , and fall ;</l>
     <l n="17">Nothing themselves , and yet expressing all .</l>
     <l n="18">Such are thy pieces , imitating life</l>
     <l n="19">So near , they almost conquer in the strife ;</l>
     <l n="20">And from their animated canvas came ,</l>
     <l n="21">Demanding souls , and loosened from the frame .</l>
     <l n="22">Prometheus , were he here , would cast away</l>
     <l n="23">His Adam , and refuse a soul to clay ;</l>
     <l n="24">And either would thy noble work inspire ,</l>
     <l n="25">Or think it warm enough , without his fire .</l>
     <l n="26">But vulgar hands may vulgar likeness raise ;</l>
     <l n="27">This is the least attendant on thy praise :</l>
     <l n="28">From hence the rudiments of art began ;</l>
     <l n="29">A coal , or chalk , first imitated man :</l>
     <l n="30">Perhaps the shadow , taken on a wall ,</l>
     <l n="31">Gave outlines to the rude original ;</l>
     <l n="32">Ere canvas yet was strained , before the grace }</l>
     <l n="33">Of blended colours found their use and place , }</l>
     <l n="34">Or cypress tablets first received a face . }</l>
     <l n="35">By slow degrees the godlike art advanced ;</l>
     <l n="36">As man grew polished , picture was enhanced :</l>
     <l n="37">Greece added posture , shade , and perspective ,</l>
     <l n="38">And then the mimic piece began to live .</l>
     <l n="39">Yet perspective was lame , no distance true ,</l>
     <l n="40">But all came forward in one common view :</l>
     <l n="41">No point of light was known , no bounds of art ;</l>
     <l n="42">When light was there , it knew not to depart ,</l>
     <l n="43">But glaring on remoter objects played ;</l>
     <l n="44">Not languished and insensibly decayed .<span corresp="#note74" type="note_anchor">[ 74 ]</span></l>
     <l n="45">Rome raised not art , but barely kept alive ,</l>
     <l n="46">And with old Greece unequally did strive ;</l>
     <l n="47">Till Goths and Vandals , a rude northern race ,</l>
     <l n="48">Did all the matchless monuments deface .</l>
     <l n="49">Then all the Muses in one ruin lie ,</l>
     <l n="50">And rhyme began to enervate poetry .</l>
     <l n="51">Thus , in a stupid military state ,</l>
     <l n="52">The pen and pencil find an equal fate .</l>
     <l n="53">Flat faces , such as would disgrace a skreen ,</l>
     <l n="54">Such as in Bantam 's embassy were seen ,</l>
     <l n="55">Unraised , unrounded , were the rude delight</l>
     <l n="56">Of brutal nations , only born to fight .</l>
     <l n="57">Long time the sister arts , in iron sleep ,</l>
     <l n="58">A heavy sabbath did supinely keep ;</l>
     <l n="59">At length , in Raphael 's age , at once they rise ,</l>
     <l n="60">Stretch all their limbs , and open all their eyes .</l>
     <l n="61">Thence rose the Roman , and the Lombard line ;</l>
     <l n="62">One coloured best , and one did best design .</l>
     <l n="63">Raphael 's , like Homer 's , was the nobler part ,</l>
     <l n="64">But Titian 's painting looked like Virgil 's art .</l>
     <l n="65">Thy genius gives thee both ; where true design ,</l>
     <l n="66">Postures unforced , and lively colours join ,</l>
     <l n="67">Likeness is ever there ; but still the best ,</l>
     <l n="68">( Like proper thoughts in lofty language drest ,)</l>
     <l n="69">Where light , to shades descending , plays , not strives ,</l>
     <l n="70">Dies by degrees , and by degrees revives .</l>
     <l n="71">Of various parts a perfect whole is wrought ;</l>

     <l n="77">His soul inspires me , while thy praise I write ,</l>

     <l n="84">Like women 's anger , impotent and loud .</l>

   <note xml:id="note74" place="bottom" n="74">The ancients did not understand perspective ; accordingly their figures represent those on an Indian paper . It seems long before it was known in England ; for so late as 1634 , Sir John Harrington thought it necessary to give the following explanation , in the advertisement to his translation of Orlando Furioso .</note>
   <p>“ The use of the picture is evident ;— that , having read over the book , they may read it as it were again in the very picture ; and one thing is to be noted , which every one haply will not observe , namely , the perspective in every figure . For the personages of men , the shapes of horses , and such like , are made large at the bottom , and lesser upward , as if you were to behold all the same in a plain , that which is nearest seems greatest , and the farthest shews smallest , which is the chief art in picture . ” ]</p>
   <note xml:id="note75" place="bottom" n="75">This portrait was copied from one in the possession of Mr Betterton , and afterwards in that of the Chandos family . Twelve engravings were executed from this painting , which , however , the ingenious Mr Stevens , and other commentators on Shakespeare , pronounced a forgery . The copy presented by Kneller to Dryden , is in the collection of Earl Fitzwilliam , at Wentworth-house ; and may claim that veneration , from having been the object of our author 's respect and enthusiasm , which has been denied to its original , as a genuine portrait of Shakespeare . It is not , however , an admitted point , that the Chandos picture is a forgery : the contrary has been keenly maintained ; and Mr Malone 's opinion has given weight to those who have espoused its defence .</note>

   <p>ELEGIES AND EPITAPHS .</p>
   <p>UPON THE DEATH OF LORD HASTINGS .</p>
   <p>The subject of this elegy was Henry Lord Hastings , eldest son of Ferdinando Earl of Huntingdon . He was born 16th January , 1630 , and died 24th June , 1649 . He was buried at Ashby de la Zouche , near the superb family-seat of Donnington-Castle . This Lord Hastings , says Collins , was a nobleman of great learning , and of so sweet a disposition , that no less than ninety-eight elegies were made on him , and published in 1650 , under this title : “ Lachrymæ Musarum , the Tears of the Muses expressed in Elegies written by divers Persons of nobility and worth , upon the Death of the most hopeful Henry , Lord Hastings , eldest son of the Right Honourable Ferdinando , Earl of Huntingdon , then general of the high-born Prince George , Duke of Clarence , brother to King Edward IV . ”</p>
   <p>This accomplished young nobleman died unmarried ; but , from the concluding lines of the elegy , it is obvious , that he had been betrothed to the “ virgin widow , ” whom the poet there addresses , but whose name I have been unable to learn .</p>
   <p>The poem was written by Dryden while at Westminster-school , and displays little or no promise of future excellence ; being a servile imitation of the conceits of Cleveland , and the metaphysical wit of Cowley , exerted in numbers hardly more harmonious than those of Donne .</p>

   <p>TO THE MEMORY OF MR OLDHAM .</p>
   <p>JOHN OLDHAM , who , from the keenness of his satirical poetry , justly acquired the title of the English Juvenal , was born at Shipton , in Gloucestershire , where his father was a clergyman , on 9th August , 1653 . About 1678 , he was an usher in the free school of Croydon ; but having already distinguished himself by several pieces of poetry , and particularly by four severe satirical invectives against the order of Jesuits , then obnoxious on account of the Popish Plot , he quitted that mean situation , to become tutor to the family of Sir Edward Theveland , and afterwards to a son of Sir William Hickes . Shortly after he seems to have resigned all employment except the unthrifty trade of poetry . When Oldham entered upon this career , he settled of course in the metropolis , where his genius recommended him to the company of the first wits , and to the friendship of Dryden . He did not long enjoy the pleasures of such a life , nor did he live to experience the uncertainties , and disappointment , and reverses , with which , above all others , it abounds . Being seized with the small-pox , while visiting at the seat of his patron , William Earl of Kingston , he died of that disease on the 9th December , 1683 , in the 30th year of his age .</p>
   <p>His “ Remains , ” in verse and prose , were soon afterwards published , with elegies and recommendatory verses prefixed by Tate , Flatman , Durfey , Gould , Andrews , and others . But the applause of Dryden , expressed in the following lines , was worth all the tame panegyrics of other contemporary bards . It appears , among the others , in “ Oldham 's Remains , ” London , 1683 .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>TO</head>
    <head>THE MEMORY</head>
    <head>OF</head>
    <head>MR OLDHAM .</head>
     <l n="1">Farewell , too little , and too lately known ,</l>
     <l n="2">Whom I began to think , and call my own :</l>
     <l n="3">For sure our souls were near allied , and thine</l>
     <l n="4">Cast in the same poetic mould with mine .</l>
     <l n="5">One common note on either lyre did strike ,</l>
     <l n="6">And knaves and fools we both abhorred alike .</l>
     <l n="7">To the same goal did both our studies drive ;</l>
     <l n="8">The last set out , the soonest did arrive .</l>
     <l n="9">Thus Nisus fell upon the slippery place ,</l>
     <l n="10">Whilst his young friend performed and won the race .</l>
     <l n="11">O early ripe ! to thy abundant store</l>
     <l n="12">What could advancing age have added more !</l>
     <l n="13">It might ( what nature never gives the young )</l>
     <l n="14">Have taught the numbers of thy native tongue .</l>
     <l n="15">But satire needs not those , and wit will shine</l>
     <l n="16">Through the harsh cadence of a rugged line .<span corresp="#note79" type="note_anchor">[ 79 ]</span></l>
     <l n="17">A noble error , and but seldom made ,</l>
     <l n="18">When poets are by too much force betrayed .</l>
     <l n="19">Thy generous fruits , though gathered ere their prime , }</l>
     <l n="20">Still shewed a quickness ; and maturing time }</l>
     <l n="21">But mellows what we write , to the dull sweets of rhyme . }</l>
     <l n="22">Once more , hail , and farewell ! farewell , thou young ,</l>
     <l n="23">But ah too short , Marcellus of our tongue !</l>
     <l n="24">Thy brows with ivy , and with laurels bound ;</l>
     <l n="25">But fate and gloomy night encompass thee around .</l>
   </lg>
   <note xml:id="note79" place="bottom" n="79">Dryden 's opinion concerning the harshness of Oldham 's numbers , was not unanimously subscribed to by contemporary authors . In the “ Historical Dictionary , ” 1694 , Oldham is termed , “ a pithy , sententious , elegant , and smooth writer : ” and Winstanley says , that none can read his works without admiration ; “ so pithy his strains , so sententious his expression , so elegant his oratory , so swimming his language , so smooth his lines . ” Tom Brown goes the length to impute our author 's qualification of his praise of Oldham to the malignant spirit of envy : “ ‘ Tis your own way , Mr Bayes , as you may remember in your verses upon Mr Oldham , where you tell the world that he was a very fine , ingenious gentleman , but still did not understand the cadence of the English tongue . ” — Reasons for Mr Bayes ’ changing his Religion , Part II . p. 33 .</note>
   <p>But this only proves , that Tom Brown and Mr Winstanley were deficient in poetical ear ; for Oldham 's satires , though full of vehemence and impressive expression , are , in diction , not much more harmonious than those of Hall or of Donne . The reader may take the following celebrated passage on the life of a nobleman 's chaplain , as illustrating both the merits and defects of his poetry :</p>

     <l n="4">Besides the advantage of his Lordship 's ear ;</l>
     <l n="5">The credit of the business , and the state ,</l>
     <l n="6">Are things that in a youngster 's sense sound great .</l>
     <l n="7">Little the unexperienced wretch doth know</l>
     <l n="8">What slavery he oft must undergo ;</l>
     <l n="9">Who , though in silken scarf and cassock dressed ,</l>
     <l n="10">Wears but a gayer livery at best</l>
     <l n="11">When dinner calls , the implement must wait ,</l>
     <l n="12">With holy words , to consecrate the meat ;</l>
     <l n="13">But hold it for a favour seldom known ,</l>
     <l n="14">If he be deigned the honour to sit down :</l>
     <l n="15">Soon as the tarts appear , Sir Crape withdraw ;</l>
     <l n="16">These dainties are not for a spiritual maw .</l>
     <l n="17">Observe your distance , and be sure to stand</l>
     <l n="18">Hard by the cistern , with your cup in hand ;</l>
     <l n="19">There for diversion you may pick your teeth ,</l>
     <l n="20">Till the kind voider comes to your relief :</l>
     <l n="21">For mere board-wages such their freedom sell ;</l>
     <l n="22">Slaves to an hour , and vassals to a bell ;</l>
     <l n="23">And if the enjoyment of one day be stole ,</l>
     <l n="24">They are but prisoners out upon parole ;</l>
     <l n="25">Always the marks of slavery retain ,</l>
     <l n="26">And e'en when loose , still drag about their chain .</l>
     <l n="27">And where 's the mighty prospect , after all ,</l>
     <l n="28">A chaplainship served up , and seven years thrall ?</l>
     <l n="29">The menial thing perhaps , for a reward ,</l>

   <p>TO</p>
   <p>THE PIOUS MEMORY</p>
   <p>OF</p>
   <p>MRS ANNE KILLIGREW .</p>
   <p>MRS ANNE KILLIGREW was daughter of Dr Henry Killigrew , master of the Savoy , and one of the prebendaries of Westminster , and brother of Thomas Killigrew , renowned , in the court of Charles II ., for wit and repartee . The family , says Mr Walpole , was remarkable for its loyalty , accomplishments , and wit ; and this young lady , who displayed great talents for painting and poetry , promised to be one of its fairest ornaments . She was maid of honour to the Duchess of York , and died of the small-pox in 1685 , the 25th year of her age .</p>
   <p>Mrs Anne Killigrew 's poems were published after her death in a thin quarto , with a print of the author , from her portrait drawn by herself . She also painted the portraits of the Duke of York and of his Duchess , and executed several historical pictures , landscapes , and pieces of still life . See Lord ORFORD 'S Lives of the Painters , Works , Vol . III . p. 297 ; and BALLARD 'S Lives of Learned Ladies .</p>
   <p>The poems of this celebrated young lady do not possess any uncommon merit , nor are her paintings of a high class , although preferred by Walpole to her poetry . But very slender attainments in such accomplishments , when united with youth , beauty , and fashion , naturally receive a much greater share of approbation from contemporaries , than unbiassed posterity can afford to them . Even the flinty heart of old Wood seems to have been melted by this young lady 's charms , notwithstanding her being of womankind , as he contemptuously calls the fair sex . He says , that she was a Grace for a beauty , and a Muse for a wit ; and that there must have been more true history than compliment in our author 's ode , since otherwise the lady 's father would not have permitted it to go to press .— Athenæ , Vol . II . p. 1036 .</p>
   <p>This ode , which singularly exhibits the strong grasp and comprehensive range of Dryden 's fancy , as well as the harmony of his numbers , seems to have been a great favourite of Dr Johnson , who , in one place , does not hesitate to compare it to the famous ode on St Cecilia ; and , in another , calls it undoubtedly the noblest ode that our language ever has produced . Although it is probable that few will subscribe to the judgment of that great critic in the present instance , yet the verses can never be read with indifference by any admirer of poetry . We are , it is true , sometimes affronted by a pun , or chilled by a conceit ; but the general power of thought and expression resumes its sway , in despite of the interruption given by such instances of bad taste . In its arrangement , the ode is what the seventeenth century called pindaric ; freed , namely , from the usual rules of order and arrangement . This license , which led most poets , who exercised it , to extravagance and absurdity , only gave Dryden a wider scope for the exercise of his wonderful power of combining and uniting the most dissimilar ideas , in a manner as ingenious as his numbers are harmonious . Images and scenes , the richest , though most inconsistent with each other , are sweeped together by the flood of song : we neither see whence they arise , nor whither they are going ; but are contented to admire the richness and luxuriance in which the poet has arrayed them . The opening of the poem has been highly praised by Dr Johnson . “ The first part , ” says that critic , “ flows with a torrent of enthusiasm ,— Fervet immensusque ruit . All the stanzas , indeed , are not equal . An imperial crown cannot be one continued diamond ; the gems must be held together by some less valuable matter . ”</p>
   <p>The stanzas , which appear to the editor peculiarly to exhibit the spirit of the pindaric ode , are the first , second , fourth , and fifth . Of the others , the third is too metaphysical for the occasion ; the description of the landscapes in the sixth is beautiful , and presents our imagination with the scenery and groups of Claude Lorraine ; and that of the royal portraits , in the seventh , has some fine lines and turns of expression : But I cannot admire , with many critics , the comparison of the progress of genius to the explosion of a sky-rocket ; and still less the flat and familiar conclusion ,</p>
   <p>What next she had designed , heaven only knows .</p>
   <p>The eighth stanza is disgraced by antitheses and conceit ; and though the beginning of the ninth be beautiful and affecting , our emotion is quelled by the nature of the consolation administered to a sea captain , that his sister is turned into a star . The last stanza excites ideas perhaps too solemn for poetry ; and what is worse , they are couched in poetry too fantastic to be solemn ; but the account of the resurrection of the “ sacred poets , ” is , in the highest degree , elegant and beautiful .</p>
   <p>Anne Killigrew was the subject of several other poetical lamentations , one or two of which are in the Luttrell Collection .</p>

She married a decent respectable country gentleman , called Wogan ; a name which , when it occurred in her extensive literary correspondence , she exchanged for the fantastic appellation of Antenor . She maintained a literary intercourse for many years with bishops , earls , and wits , the main object of which was the management and extrication of her husband 's affairs . But whether because the correspondents of Orinda were slack in attending to her requests in her husband 's favour , or whether because a learned lady is a bad manager of sublunary concerns , Antenor 's circumstances became embarrassed , notwithstanding all Orinda 's exertions , and the fair solicitor was obliged to retreat with him into Cardiganshire .

   <p>UPON THE DEATH OF</p>
   <p>THE VISCOUNT OF DUNDEE .</p>
   <p>JAMES GRAHAM of Claverhouse , Viscount of Dundee , studied the military art under the Prince of Orange . He first distinguished himself by his activity in exercising the severities which the Scottish council , in the reigns of Charles II . and James II ., decreed against the frequenters of the field-meetings and conventicles . On this account his memory is generally reprobated by the Scottish presbyterians ; nor would history have treated him more gently , had not the splendour of his closing life effaced the recollection of his cruelties . When the Scottish Convention declared for the Prince of Orange in 1688-9 , Dundee left Edinburgh , and retired to the north , where he raised the Highland clans , to prop the sinking cause of James II . After an interval of a few months , spent in desultory warfare , General Mackay marched , with a regular force , towards Blair in Athole , against this active and enterprising enemy . Upon the 17th June , 1689 , when Mackay had defiled through the rocky and precipitous pass of Killicrankie , he found Dundee , with his Highlanders , arranged upon an eminence opposite to the northern mouth of the defile . Dundee permitted his adversary gradually , and at leisure , to disengage himself from the pass , and draw up his army in line ; for , meditating a total victory , and not a mere check or repulse , he foresaw that Mackay 's retreat would be difficult in proportion to the distance of his forces from the only path of safety through which they could fly . He then charged with irresistible fury , and routed Mackay 's army in every direction , saving two regiments who stood firm . But as Dundee hastened towards them , and extended his arm as if urging the assault , a shot penetrated his armour beneath his arm-pit , and he dropt from his horse . He lived but a very short time , and died in the arms of victory . With Dundee fell all hopes of restoring King James 's affairs in Scotland ; the independent chieftains , who had been overawed by his superior talents , resumed the petty altercations which his authority had decided or suppressed ; their followers melted away without a battle ; and after his death , those who had been rather the implements than the companions of his victory , met nothing but repulse and defeat , until all the north of Scotland submitted to William III .</p>
   <p>The epitaph , here translated by Dryden , was originally written in Latin by Dr Pitcairn , remarkable for genius and learning , as well as for Jacobitism . It will hardly be disputed , that the original is much superior to the translation , though the last be written by Dryden . In the second couplet alone , the translator has improved upon his original :</p>

    <head>ELEONORA .</head>
     <l n="1">MR. MALONE has given a full account of the lady in whose honour this</l>
     <l n="2">poem was written : “ Eleonora , eldest daughter , and at length sole heir ,</l>
     <l n="3">of Sir Henry Lee , of Ditchley , in the county of Oxford , Baronet , by</l>
     <l n="4">Anne , daughter of Sir John Danvers , and sister and heir to Henry</l>
     <l n="5">Danvers , Esq ., who was nephew and heir to Henry , Earl of Danby : She was</l>

     <l n="7">Her lord , in 1698 , married a second wife , Catharine , daughter of Sir</l>
     <l n="8">Thomas Chamberlaine , Bart . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Her death was unexpectedly sudden , and took place in a ball-room in her own house ; a circumstance which our author has hardly glanced at , although capable of striking illustration ; and although one might have thought he would have grasped at whatever could assist him in executing the difficult task , of an elegy written by desire of a nobleman whom he did not know , in memory of a lady whom he had never seen . It is to be presumed , that the task imposed was handsomely recompensed ; for we can hardly conceive one in itself more unpleasant or unprofitable . Notwithstanding Dryden 's professions , that he “ swam with the tide ” while composing this piece , and that the variety and multitude of his similies were owing to the divine afflatus and the influence of his subject , we may be fairly permitted to doubt , whether they did not rather originate in an attempt to supply the lack of real sympathy , by the indulgence of a luxuriant imagination . The commencement has been rather severely censured by Dr Johnson ; the comparison , he says , contains no illustration . As a king would be lamented , Eleonora was lamented : “ This , ” observes he , “ is little better than to say of a shrub , that it is as green as a tree ; or of a brook , that it waters a garden , as a river waters a country . ” But , I presume , the point on which Dryden meant the comparison to depend , was , the extent of the lamentation occasioned by Eleonora 's death ; in which particular the simile conveyed an illustration as ample , as if Dryden had said of a myrtle , it was as tall as an oak , or of a brook , it was as deep as the Thames .</p>
   <p>The poem is certainly totally deficient in interest ; for the character has no peculiarity of features : But , considered as an abstract example of female perfection , we may admire the ideal Eleonora , as we do the fancy-piece of a celebrated painter , though with an internal consciousness that the original never existed .</p>
   <p>“ Eleonora ” first appeared in quarto , in 1692 , probably about the end of autumn ; as Dryden alludes to the intervention of some months between Lord Abingdon 's commands and his own performance .</p>

    <head>TO</head>
    <head>THE RIGHT HONOURABLE</head>
     <l n="1">THE EARL OF ABINGDON , &amp; c.<span corresp="#note85" type="note_anchor">[ 85 ]</span></l>
   </lg>
   <p>MY LORD ,</p>
   <p>The commands , with which you honoured me some months ago , are now performed : they had been sooner , but betwixt ill health , some business , and many troubles , I was forced to defer them till this time . Ovid , going to his banishment , and writing from on shipboard to his friends , excused the faults of his poetry by his misfortunes ; and told them , that good verses never flow , but from a serene and composed spirit . Wit , which is a kind of Mercury , with wings fastened to his head and heels , can fly but slowly in a damp air . I therefore chose rather to obey you late than ill : if at least I am capable of writing any thing , at any time , which is worthy your perusal and your patronage . I cannot say that I have escaped from a shipwreck ; but have only gained a rock by hard swimming , where I may pant awhile and gather breath ; for the doctors give me a sad assurance , that my disease<span corresp="#note86" type="note_anchor">[ 86 ]</span>never took its leave of any man , but with a purpose to return . However , my lord , I have laid hold on the interval , and managed the small stock , which age has left me , to the best advantage , in performing this inconsiderable service to my lady 's memory . We , who are priests of Apollo , have not the inspiration when we please ; but must wait till the God comes rushing on us , and invades us with a fury which we are not able to resist ; which gives us double strength while the fit continues , and leaves us languishing and spent , at its departure . Let me not seem to boast , my lord , for I have really felt it on this occasion , and prophesied beyond my natural power . Let me add , and hope to be believed , that the excellency of the subject contributed much to the happiness of the execution ; and that the weight of thirty years was taken off me while I was writing . I swam with the tide , and the water under me was buoyant . The reader will easily observe , that I was transported by the multitude and variety of my similitudes ; which are generally the product of a luxuriant fancy , and the wantonness of wit . Had I called in my judgment to my assistance , I had certainly retrenched many of them . But I defend them not ; let them pass for beautiful faults amongst the better sort of critics ; for the whole poem , though written in that which they call heroic verse , is of the pindaric nature , as well in the thought as the expression ; and , as such , requires the same grains of allowance for it . It was intended , as your lordship sees in the title , not for an elegy , but a panegyric : a kind of apotheosis , indeed , if a heathen word may be applied to a Christian use . And on all occasions of praise , if we take the ancients for our patterns , we are bound by prescription to employ the magnificence of words , and the force of figures , to adorn the sublimity of thoughts . Isocrates amongst the Grecian orators , and Cicero , and the younger Pliny , amongst the Romans , have left us their precedents for our security ; for I think I need not mention the inimitable Pindar , who stretches on these pinions out of sight , and is carried upward , as it were , into another world .</p>
   <p>This , at least , my lord , I may justly plead , that , if I have not performed so well as I think I have , yet I have used my best endeavours to excel myself . One disadvantage I have had , which is , never to have known or seen my lady ; and to draw the lineaments of her mind from the description which I have received from others , is for a painter to set himself at work without the living original before him ; which , the more beautiful it is , will be so much the more difficult for him to conceive , when he has only a relation given him of such and such features by an acquaintance or a friend , without the nice touches , which give the best resemblance , and make the graces of the picture . Every artist is apt enough to flatter himself , and I amongst the rest , that their own ocular observations would have discovered more perfections , at least others , than have been delivered to them ; though I have received mine from the best hands , that is , from persons who neither want a just understanding of my lady 's worth , nor a due veneration for her memory .</p>
   <p>Doctor Donne , the greatest wit , though not the best poet of our nation , acknowledges , that he had never seen Mrs Drury , whom he has made immortal in his admirable “ Anniversaries . "[ 87 ] I have had the same fortune , though I have not succeeded to the same genius . However , I have followed his footsteps in the design of his panegyric ; which was to raise an emulation in the living , to copy out the example of the dead . And therefore it was , that I once intended to have called this poem “ The Pattern ; ” and though , on a second consideration , I changed the title into the name of that illustrious person , yet the design continues , and Eleonora is still the pattern of charity , devotion , and humility ; of the best wife , the best mother , and the best of friends .</p>
   <p>And now , my lord , though I have endeavoured to answer your commands , yet I could not answer it to the world , nor to my conscience , if I gave not your lordship my testimony of being the best husband now living : I say my testimony only ; for the praise of it is given you by yourself . They , who despise the rules of virtue both in their practice and their morals , will think this a very trivial commendation . But I think it the peculiar happiness of the Countess of Abingdon , to have been so truly loved by you , while she was living , and so gratefully honoured , after she was dead . Few there are who have either had , or could have , such a loss ; and yet fewer , who carried their love and constancy beyond the grave . The exteriors of mourning , a decent funeral , and black habits , are the usual stints of common husbands ; and perhaps their wives deserve no better than to be mourned with hypocrisy , and forgot with ease . But you have distinguished yourself from ordinary lovers , by a real and lasting grief for the deceased ; and by endeavouring to raise for her the most durable monument , which is that of verse . And so it would have proved , if the workman had been equal to the work , and your choice of the artificer as happy as your design . Yet , as Phidias , when he had made the statue of Minerva , could not forbear to engrave his own name , as author of the piece ; so give me leave to hope , that , by subscribing mine to this poem , I may live by the goddess , and transmit my name to posterity by the memory of hers . It is no flattery to assure your lordship , that she is remembered , in the present age , by all who have had the honour of her conversation and acquaintance ; and that I have never been in any company since the news of her death was first brought me , where they have not extolled her virtues , and even spoken the same things of her in prose , which I have done in verse .</p>
   <p>I therefore think myself obliged to your lordship for the commission which you have given me : how I have acquitted myself of it , must be left to the opinion of the world , in spite of any protestation which I can enter against the present age , as incompetent or corrupt judges . For my comfort , they are but Englishmen ; and , as such , if they think ill of me to-day , they are inconstant enough to think well of me to-morrow . And after all , I have not much to thank my fortune that I was born amongst them . The good of both sexes are so few , in England , that they stand like exceptions against general rules ; and though one of them has deserved a greater commendation than I could give her , they have taken care that I should not tire my pen with frequent exercise on the like subjects ; that praises , like taxes , should be appropriated , and left almost as individual as the person . They say , my talent is satire ; if it be so , it is a fruitful age , and there is an extraordinary crop to gather , but a single hand is insufficient for such a harvest : they have sown the dragon 's teeth themselves , and it is but just they should reap each other in lampoons . You , my lord , who have the character of honour , though it is not my happiness to know you , may stand aside , with the small remainders of the English nobility , truly such , and , unhurt yourselves , behold the mad combat . If I have pleased you , and some few others , I have obtained my end . You see I have disabled myself , like an elected Speaker of the House ; yet , like him , I have undertaken the charge , and find the burden sufficiently recompensed by the honour . Be pleased to accept of these my unworthy labours , this paper monument ; and let her pious memory , which I am sure is sacred to you , not only plead the pardon of my many faults , but gain me your protection , which is ambitiously sought by ,</p>
   <p>My LORD , Your Lordship 's Most obedient servant , JOHN DRYDEN .</p>

     <l n="85">Such was her soul ; abhorring avarice ,</l>
     <l n="86">Bounteous , but almost bounteous to a vice ;</l>
     <l n="87">Had she given more , it had profusion been ,</l>
     <l n="88">And turned the excess of goodness into sin .</l>
     <l n="89">These virtues raised her fabric to the sky ;</l>
     <l n="90">For that which is next heaven is charity .</l>
     <l n="91">But as high turrets for their airy steep</l>
     <l n="92">Require foundations in proportion deep ,</l>
     <l n="93">And lofty cedars as far upward shoot</l>
     <l n="94">As to the nether heavens they drive the root ;</l>
     <l n="95">So low did her secure foundation lie ,</l>
     <l n="96">She was not humble , but humility .</l>
     <l n="97">Scarcely she knew that she was great , or fair , }</l>
     <l n="98">Or wise , beyond what other women are , }</l>
     <l n="99">Or , which is better , knew , but never durst compare . }</l>
     <l n="100">For , to be conscious of what all admire ,</l>
     <l n="101">And not be vain , advances virtue higher .</l>
     <l n="102">But still she found , or rather thought she found ,</l>
     <l n="103">Her own worth wanting , others ’ to abound ;</l>
     <l n="104">Ascribed above their due to every one ,</l>
     <l n="105">Unjust and scanty to herself alone .</l>
     <l n="106">Such her devotion was , as might give rules</l>
     <l n="107">Of speculation to disputing schools ,</l>
     <l n="108">And teach us equally the scales to hold</l>
     <l n="109">Betwixt the two extremes of hot and cold ;</l>
     <l n="110">That pious heat may moderately prevail ,</l>
     <l n="111">And we be warmed , but not be scorched with zeal .</l>
     <l n="112">Business might shorten , not disturb , her prayer ;</l>
     <l n="113">Heaven had the best , if not the greater share .</l>
     <l n="114">An active life long orisons forbids ;</l>
     <l n="115">Yet still she prayed , for still she prayed by deeds .</l>
     <l n="116">Her every day was sabbath ; only free</l>
     <l n="117">From hours of prayer , for hours of charity .</l>
     <l n="118">Such as the Jews from servile toil released ,</l>
     <l n="119">Where works of mercy were a part of rest ;</l>
     <l n="120">Such as blest angels exercise above ,</l>
     <l n="121">Varied with sacred hymns and acts of love ;</l>
     <l n="122">Such sabbaths as that one she now enjoys ,</l>
     <l n="123">E'en that perpetual one , which she employs ,</l>
     <l n="124">( For such vicissitudes in heaven there are )</l>
     <l n="125">In praise alternate , and alternate prayer .</l>
     <l n="126">All this she practised here , that when she sprung</l>
     <l n="127">Amidst the choirs , at the first sight she sung ;</l>
     <l n="128">Sung , and was sung herself in angels ’ lays ;</l>
     <l n="129">For , praising her , they did her Maker praise .</l>
     <l n="130">All offices of heaven so well she knew ,</l>
     <l n="131">Before she came , that nothing there was new ;</l>
     <l n="132">And she was so familiarly received ,</l>
     <l n="133">As one returning , not as one arrived .</l>
     <l n="134">Muse , down again precipitate thy flight ;</l>
     <l n="135">For how can mortal eyes sustain immortal light ?</l>
     <l n="136">But as the sun in water we can bear ,</l>
     <l n="137">Yet not the sun , but his reflection there ,</l>
     <l n="138">So let us view her here in what she was ,</l>
     <l n="139">And take her image in this watery glass :</l>
     <l n="140">Yet look not every lineament to see ; }</l>
     <l n="141">Some will be cast in shades , and some will be }</l>
     <l n="142">So lamely drawn , you 'll scarcely know ‘ tis she . }</l>
     <l n="143">For where such various virtues we recite , }</l>
     <l n="144">‘ Tis like the milky-way , all over bright , }</l>
     <l n="145">But sown so thick with stars , ‘ tis undistinguished light . }</l>
     <l n="146">Her virtue , not her virtues , let us call ;</l>
     <l n="147">For one heroic comprehends them all :</l>
     <l n="148">One , as a constellation is but one , }</l>
     <l n="149">Though ‘ tis a train of stars , that , rolling on , }</l>
     <l n="150">Rise in their turn , and in the zodiac run , }</l>
     <l n="151">Ever in motion ; now ‘ tis faith ascends , }</l>
     <l n="152">Now hope , now charity , that upward tends , }</l>
     <l n="153">And downwards with diffusive good descends . }</l>
     <l n="154">As in perfumes composed with art and cost ,</l>
     <l n="155">Tis hard to say what scent is uppermost ;</l>
     <l n="156">Nor this part musk or civet can we call ,</l>
     <l n="157">Or amber , but a rich result of all ;</l>
     <l n="158">So she was all a sweet , whose every part ,</l>
     <l n="159">In due proportion mixed , proclaimed the Maker 's art .</l>
     <l n="160">No single virtue we could most commend ,</l>
     <l n="161">Whether the wife , the mother , or the friend ;</l>
     <l n="162">For she was all , in that supreme degree ,</l>
     <l n="163">That as no one prevailed , so all was she .</l>
     <l n="164">The several parts lay hidden in the piece ;</l>
     <l n="165">The occasion but exerted that , or this .</l>
     <l n="166">A wife as tender , and as true withal ,</l>
     <l n="167">As the first woman was before her fall :</l>
     <l n="168">Made for the man , of whom she was a part ;</l>
     <l n="169">Made to attract his eyes , and keep his heart .</l>
     <l n="170">A second Eve , but by no crime accurst ;</l>
     <l n="171">As beauteous , not as brittle as the first .</l>
     <l n="172">Had she been first , still Paradise had been ,</l>
     <l n="173">And death had found no entrance by her sin .</l>
     <l n="174">So she not only had preserved from ill</l>
     <l n="175">Her sex and ours , but lived their pattern still .</l>
     <l n="176">Love and obedience to her lord she bore ;</l>
     <l n="177">She much obeyed him , but she loved him more :</l>
     <l n="178">Not awed to duty by superior sway ,</l>
     <l n="179">But taught by his indulgence to obey .</l>
     <l n="180">Thus we love God , as author of our good ;</l>
     <l n="181">So subjects love just kings , or so they should .</l>
     <l n="182">Nor was it with ingratitude returned ; }</l>
     <l n="183">In equal fires the blissful couple burned ; }</l>
     <l n="184">One joy possessed them both , and in one grief they mourned . }</l>
     <l n="185">His passion still improved ; he loved so fast ,</l>
     <l n="186">As if he feared each day would be her last .</l>
     <l n="187">Too true a prophet to foresee the fate</l>
     <l n="188">That should so soon divide their happy state ;</l>
     <l n="189">When he to heaven entirely must restore</l>
     <l n="190">That love , that heart , where he went halves before .</l>
     <l n="191">Yet as the soul is all in every part ,</l>
     <l n="192">So God and he might each have all her heart .</l>
     <l n="193">So had her children too ; for charity</l>
     <l n="194">Was not more fruitful , or more kind , than she :[ 89 ]</l>
     <l n="195">Each under other by degrees they grew ;</l>
     <l n="196">A goodly perspective of distant view .</l>
     <l n="197">Anchises looked not with so pleased a face ,</l>
     <l n="198">In numbering o'er his future Roman race ,<span corresp="#note90" type="note_anchor">[ 90 ]</span></l>
     <l n="199">And marshalling the heroes of his name ,</l>
     <l n="200">As , in their order , next to light they came ;</l>
     <l n="201">Nor Cybele , with half so kind an eye ,</l>
     <l n="202">Surveyed her sons and daughters of the sky ;</l>
     <l n="203">Proud , shall I say , of her immortal fruit ?</l>
     <l n="204">As far as pride with heavenly minds may suit .</l>
     <l n="205">Her pious love excelled to all she bore ;</l>
     <l n="206">New objects only multiplied it more .</l>
     <l n="207">And as the chosen found the pearly grain</l>
     <l n="208">As much as every vessel could contain ;</l>
     <l n="209">As in the blissful vision each shall share }</l>
     <l n="210">As much of glory as his soul can bear ; }</l>
     <l n="211">So did she love , and so dispense her care . }</l>
     <l n="212">Her eldest thus , by consequence , was best ,</l>
     <l n="213">As longer cultivated than the rest .</l>
     <l n="214">The babe had all that infant care beguiles ,</l>
     <l n="215">And early knew his mother in her smiles :</l>
     <l n="216">But when dilated organs let in day</l>
     <l n="217">To the young soul , and gave it room to play ,</l>
     <l n="218">At his first aptness , the maternal love</l>
     <l n="219">Those rudiments of reason did improve :</l>
     <l n="220">The tender age was pliant to command ;</l>
     <l n="221">Like wax it yielded to the forming hand :</l>
     <l n="222">True to the artificer , the laboured mind</l>
     <l n="223">With ease was pious , generous , just , and kind ;</l>
     <l n="224">Soft for impression , from the first prepared ,</l>
     <l n="225">Till virtue with long exercise grew hard :</l>
     <l n="226">With every act confirmed , and made at last</l>
     <l n="227">So durable as not to be effaced ,</l>
     <l n="228">It turned to habit ; and , from vices free ,</l>
     <l n="229">Goodness resolved into necessity .</l>
     <l n="230">Thus fixed she virtue 's image , ( that 's her own ,)</l>
     <l n="231">Till the whole mother in the children shone ;</l>
     <l n="232">For that was their perfection : she was such ,</l>
     <l n="233">They never could express her mind too much .</l>
     <l n="234">So unexhausted her perfections were ,</l>
     <l n="235">That , for more children , she had more to spare ;</l>
     <l n="236">For souls unborn , whom her untimely death</l>
     <l n="237">Deprived of bodies , and of mortal breath ;</l>
     <l n="238">And , could they take the impressions of her mind ,</l>
     <l n="239">Enough still left to sanctify her kind .</l>
     <l n="240">Then wonder not to see this soul extend</l>
     <l n="241">The bounds , and seek some other self , a friend ;</l>
     <l n="242">As swelling seas to gentle rivers glide ,</l>
     <l n="243">To seek repose , and empty out the tide ;</l>
     <l n="244">So this full soul , in narrow limits pent ,</l>
     <l n="245">Unable to contain her , sought a vent</l>
     <l n="246">To issue out , and in some friendly breast</l>
     <l n="247">Discharge her treasures , and securely rest ;</l>
     <l n="248">To unbosom all the secrets of her heart ,</l>
     <l n="249">Take good advice , but better to impart .</l>
     <l n="250">For ‘ tis the bliss of friendship 's holy state , }</l>
     <l n="251">To mix their minds , and to communicate ; }</l>
     <l n="252">Though bodies cannot , souls can penetrate : }</l>
     <l n="253">Fixed to her choice , inviolably true ,</l>
     <l n="254">And wisely choosing , for she chose but few .</l>
     <l n="255">Some she must have ; but in no one could find</l>
     <l n="256">A tally fitted for so large a mind .</l>
     <l n="257">The souls of friends like kings in progress are ,</l>
     <l n="258">Still in their own , though from the palace far :</l>
     <l n="259">Thus her friend 's heart her country dwelling was ,</l>
     <l n="260">A sweet retirement to a coarser place ;</l>
     <l n="261">Where pomp and ceremonies entered not ,</l>
     <l n="262">Where greatness was shut out , and business well forgot .</l>
     <l n="263">This is the imperfect draught ; but short as far }</l>
     <l n="264">As the true height and bigness of a star }</l>
     <l n="265">Exceeds the measures of the astronomer . }</l>
     <l n="266">She shines above , we know ; but in what place ,</l>
     <l n="267">How near the throne , and heaven 's imperial face ,</l>
     <l n="268">By our weak optics is but vainly guessed ;</l>
     <l n="269">Distance and altitude conceal the rest .</l>
     <l n="270">Though all these rare endowments of the mind</l>
     <l n="271">Were in a narrow space of life confined ,</l>
     <l n="272">The figure was with full perfection crowned ;</l>
     <l n="273">Though not so large an orb , as truly round .</l>
     <l n="274">As when in glory , through the public place ,</l>
     <l n="275">The spoils of conquered nations were to pass ,</l>
     <l n="276">And but one day for triumph was allowed ,</l>
     <l n="277">The consul was constrained his pomp to crowd ;</l>
     <l n="278">And so the swift procession hurried on ,</l>
     <l n="279">That all , though not distinctly , might be shewn :</l>
     <l n="280">So in the straitened bounds of life confined ,</l>
     <l n="281">She gave but glimpses of her glorious mind ;</l>
     <l n="282">And multitudes of virtues passed along ,</l>
     <l n="283">Each pressing foremost in the mighty throng ,</l>
     <l n="284">Ambitious to be seen , and then make room</l>
     <l n="285">For greater multitudes that were to come .</l>
     <l n="286">Yet unemployed no minute slipped away ;</l>
     <l n="287">Moments were precious in so short a stay .</l>
     <l n="288">The haste of heaven to have her was so great , }</l>
     <l n="289">That some were single acts , though each complete ; }</l>
     <l n="290">But every act stood ready to repeat . }</l>
     <l n="291">Her fellow-saints with busy care will look</l>
     <l n="292">For her blest name in fate 's eternal book ;</l>
     <l n="293">And , pleased to be outdone , with joy will see</l>
     <l n="294">Numberless virtues , endless charity :</l>
     <l n="295">But more will wonder at so short an age ,</l>
     <l n="296">To find a blank beyond the thirtieth page ;</l>
     <l n="297">And with a pious fear begin to doubt</l>
     <l n="298">The piece imperfect , and the rest torn out .</l>
     <l n="299">But ‘ twas her Saviour 's time ;<span corresp="#note91" type="note_anchor">[ 91 ]</span>and , could there be</l>
     <l n="300">A copy near the original , ‘ twas she .</l>
     <l n="301">As precious gums are not for lasting fire ,</l>
     <l n="302">They but perfume the temple , and expire ;</l>
     <l n="303">So was she soon exhaled , and vanished hence ;</l>
     <l n="304">A short sweet odour , of a vast expence .</l>
     <l n="305">She vanished , we can scarcely say she died ;</l>
     <l n="306">For but a now did heaven and earth divide :</l>
     <l n="307">She passed serenely with a single breath ;</l>
     <l n="308">This moment perfect health , the next was death :</l>
     <l n="309">One sigh did her eternal bliss assure ;</l>
     <l n="310">So little penance needs , when souls are almost pure .</l>
     <l n="311">As gentle dreams our waking thoughts pursue ,</l>
     <l n="312">Or , one dream passed , we slide into a new ;</l>
     <l n="313">So close they follow , such wild order keep ,</l>
     <l n="314">We think ourselves awake , and are asleep ;</l>
     <l n="315">So softly death succeeded life in her ,</l>
     <l n="316">She did but dream of heaven , and she was there .</l>
     <l n="317">No pains she suffered , nor expired with noise ;</l>
     <l n="318">Her soul was whispered out with God 's still voice ;</l>
     <l n="319">As an old friend is beckoned to a feast ,</l>
     <l n="320">And treated like a long-familiar guest .</l>
     <l n="321">He took her as he found , but found her so ,</l>
     <l n="322">As one in hourly readiness to go ;</l>
     <l n="323">E'en on that day , in all her trim prepared ,<span corresp="#note92" type="note_anchor">[ 92 ]</span></l>
     <l n="324">As early notice she from heaven had heard ,</l>
     <l n="325">And some descending courier from above</l>
     <l n="326">Had given her timely warning to remove ;</l>
     <l n="327">Or counselled her to dress the nuptial room ,</l>
     <l n="328">For on that night the bridegroom was to come .</l>
     <l n="329">He kept his hour , and found her where she lay ,</l>
     <l n="330">Clothed all in white , the livery of the day :[ 93 ]</l>
     <l n="331">Scarce had she sinned in thought , or word , or act ,</l>
     <l n="332">Unless omissions were to pass for fact ;</l>
     <l n="333">That hardly death a consequence could draw ,</l>
     <l n="334">To make her liable to nature 's law .</l>
     <l n="335">And , that she died , we only have to shew</l>
     <l n="336">The mortal part of her she left below ;</l>

     <l n="338">Looked like translation through the firmament , }</l>
     <l n="339">Or like the fiery car on the third errand sent . }</l>
     <l n="340">O happy soul ! if thou canst view from high ,</l>
     <l n="341">Where thou art all intelligence , all eye ,</l>
     <l n="342">If looking up to God , or down to us ,</l>
     <l n="343">Thou find'st , that any way be pervious ,</l>
     <l n="344">Survey the ruins of thy house , and see</l>
     <l n="345">Thy widowed and thy orphan family ;</l>

     <l n="349">To thy sad children , and thy mourning lord .</l>
     <l n="350">See how they grieve , mistaken in their love ,</l>
     <l n="351">And shed a beam of comfort from above ;</l>
     <l n="352">Give them , as much as mortal eyes can bear ,</l>
     <l n="353">A transient view of thy full glories there ;</l>
     <l n="354">That they with moderate sorrow may sustain ,</l>
     <l n="355">And mollify their losses in thy gain .</l>
     <l n="356">Or else divide the grief ; for such thou wert , }</l>
     <l n="357">That should not all relations bear a part , }</l>
     <l n="358">It were enough to break a single heart . }</l>
     <l n="359">Let this suffice : nor thou , great saint , refuse</l>

     <l n="361">Who , not by cares , or wants , or age deprest ,</l>
     <l n="362">Stems a wild deluge with a dauntless breast ;</l>
     <l n="363">And dares to sing thy praises in a clime</l>
     <l n="364">Where vice triumphs , and virtue is a crime ;</l>
     <l n="365">Where e'en to draw the picture of thy mind ,</l>
     <l n="366">Is satire on the most of human kind :</l>
     <l n="367">Take it , while yet ‘ tis praise ; before my rage ,</l>
     <l n="368">Unsafely just , break loose on this bad age ;</l>
     <l n="369">So bad , that thou thyself hadst no defence</l>
     <l n="370">From vice , but barely by departing hence .</l>
     <l n="371">Be what , and where thou art ; to wish thy place ,</l>
     <l n="372">Were , in the best , presumption more than grace .</l>
     <l n="373">Thy relics , ( such thy works of mercy are )</l>
     <l n="374">Have , in this poem , been my holy care .</l>
     <l n="375">As earth thy body keeps , thy soul the sky , }</l>
     <l n="376">So shall this verse preserve thy memory ; }</l>

    <head>ON</head>
    <head>THE DEATH OF AMYNTAS .</head>
    <head>A PASTORAL ELEGY .</head>
     <l n="1">‘ Twas on a joyless and a gloomy morn ,</l>
     <l n="2">Wet was the grass , and hung with pearls the thorn ,</l>
     <l n="3">When Damon , who designed to pass the day</l>
     <l n="4">With hounds and horns , and chace the flying prey ,</l>
     <l n="5">Rose early from his bed ; but soon he found }</l>
     <l n="6">The welkin pitched with sullen clouds around , }</l>
     <l n="7">An eastern wind , and dew upon the ground . }</l>
     <l n="8">Thus while he stood , and sighing did survey</l>
     <l n="9">The fields , and curst the ill omens of the day ,</l>
     <l n="10">He saw Menalcas come with heavy pace :</l>
     <l n="11">Wet were his eyes , and cheerless was his face :</l>
     <l n="12">He wrung his hands , distracted with his care ,</l>
     <l n="13">And sent his voice before him from afar .</l>
     <l n="14">“ Return , ” he cried , “ return , unhappy swain ,</l>
     <l n="15">The spungy clouds are filled with gathering rain :</l>
     <l n="16">The promise of the day not only crossed ,</l>
     <l n="17">But even the spring , the spring itself is lost .</l>
     <l n="18">Amyntas — oh ! ” — he could not speak the rest ,</l>
     <l n="19">Nor needed , for presaging Damon guessed .</l>
     <l n="20">Equal with heaven young Damon loved the boy ,</l>
     <l n="21">The boast of nature , both his parents ’ joy .</l>
     <l n="22">His graceful form revolving in his mind ;</l>
     <l n="23">So great a genius , and a soul so kind ,</l>
     <l n="24">Gave sad assurance that his fears were true ;</l>
     <l n="25">Too well the envy of the gods he knew :</l>
     <l n="26">For when their gifts too lavishly are placed ,</l>
     <l n="27">Soon they repent , and will not make them last .</l>
     <l n="28">For sure it was too bountiful a dole ,</l>
     <l n="29">The mother 's features , and the father 's soul .</l>
     <l n="30">Then thus he cried :— “ The morn bespoke the news ;</l>
     <l n="31">The morning did her cheerful light diffuse ;</l>
     <l n="32">But see how suddenly she changed her face , }</l>
     <l n="33">And brought on clouds and rain , the day 's disgrace ; }</l>
     <l n="34">Just such , Amyntas , was thy promised race . }</l>
     <l n="35">What charms adorned thy youth , where nature smiled ,</l>
     <l n="36">And more than man was given us in a child !</l>
     <l n="37">His infancy was ripe ; a soul sublime</l>
     <l n="38">In years so tender that prevented time :</l>
     <l n="39">Heaven gave him all at once ; then snatched away , }</l>
     <l n="40">Ere mortals all his beauties could survey ; }</l>
     <l n="41">Just like the flower that buds and withers in a day . }</l>

     <l n="5">All were in floods of tears and endless sorrow drowned . }</l>
     <l n="6">So dire a sadness sat on every look ,</l>
     <l n="7">Even death repented he had given the stroke .</l>
     <l n="8">He grieved his fatal work had been ordained ,</l>
     <l n="9">But promised length of life to those who yet remained .</l>
     <l n="10">The mother 's and her eldest daughter 's grace ,</l>
     <l n="11">It seems , had bribed him to prolong their space .</l>
     <l n="12">The father bore it with undaunted soul ,</l>
     <l n="13">Like one who durst his destiny controul ;</l>
     <l n="14">Yet with becoming grief he bore his part ,</l>

    <head>THE DEATH</head>
    <head>OF</head>
    <head>A VERY YOUNG GENTLEMAN .</head>
     <l n="1">He , who could view the book of destiny ,</l>
     <l n="2">And read whatever there was writ of thee ,</l>
     <l n="3">O charming youth , in the first opening page ,</l>
     <l n="4">So many graces in so green an age ,</l>
     <l n="5">Such wit , such modesty , such strength of mind ,</l>
     <l n="6">A soul at once so manly and so kind ,</l>
     <l n="7">Would wonder when he turned the volume o'er ,</l>
     <l n="8">And , after some few leaves , should find no more .</l>
     <l n="9">Nought but a blank remain , a dead void space ,</l>
     <l n="10">A step of life that promised such a race .</l>
     <l n="11">We must not , dare not , think , that heaven began</l>
     <l n="12">A child , and could not finish him a man ;</l>
     <l n="13">Reflecting what a mighty store was laid</l>
     <l n="14">Of rich materials , and a model made :</l>
     <l n="15">The cost already furnished ; so bestowed ,</l>
     <l n="16">As more was never to one soul allowed :</l>
     <l n="17">Yet after this profusion spent in vain ,</l>
     <l n="18">Nothing but mouldering ashes to remain ,</l>
     <l n="19">I guess not , lest I split upon the shelf ,</l>
     <l n="20">Yet , durst I guess , heaven kept it for himself ;</l>
     <l n="21">And giving us the use , did soon recal ,</l>
     <l n="22">Ere we could spare the mighty principal .</l>
     <l n="23">Thus then he disappeared , was rarefied ,</l>
     <l n="24">For ‘ tis improper speech to say he died :</l>
     <l n="25">He was exhaled ; his great Creator drew</l>
     <l n="26">His spirit , as the sun the morning dew .</l>
     <l n="27">‘ Tis sin produces death ; and he had none ,</l>
     <l n="28">But the taint Adam left on every son .</l>
     <l n="29">He added not , he was so pure , so good ,</l>
     <l n="30">‘ Twas but the original forfeit of his blood ;</l>
     <l n="31">And that so little , that the river ran</l>
     <l n="32">More clear than the corrupted fount began .</l>
     <l n="33">Nothing remained of the first muddy clay ;</l>
     <l n="34">The length of course had washed it in the way :</l>
     <l n="35">So deep , and yet so clear , we might behold</l>
     <l n="36">The gravel bottom , and that bottom gold .</l>
     <l n="37">As such we loved , admired , almost adored ,</l>
     <l n="38">Gave all the tribute mortals could afford .</l>
     <l n="39">Perhaps we gave so much , the powers above</l>
     <l n="40">Grew angry at our superstitious love ;</l>
     <l n="41">For when we more than human homage pay ,</l>
     <l n="42">The charming cause is justly snatched away .</l>
     <l n="43">Thus was the crime not his , but ours alone ;</l>
     <l n="44">And yet we murmur that he went so soon ,</l>
     <l n="45">Though miracles are short , and rarely shown .</l>
     <l n="46">Learn then , ye mournful parents , and divide</l>
     <l n="47">That love in many , which in one was tied .</l>
     <l n="48">That individual blessing is no more ,</l>
     <l n="49">But multiplied in your remaining store .</l>
     <l n="50">The flame 's dispersed , but does not all expire ;</l>
     <l n="51">The sparkles blaze , though not the globe of fire .</l>
     <l n="52">Love him by parts , in all your numerous race ,</l>
     <l n="53">And from those parts form one collected grace ;</l>
     <l n="54">Then , when you have refined to that degree ,</l>
     <l n="55">Imagine all in one , and think that one is he .</l>

    <head>YOUNG MR ROGERS ,</head>

    <head>The family of Rogers seems to have been of considerable antiquity in Gloucestershire . They possessed the estate of Dowdeswell during the greater part of the 16th and 17th centuries .

   </lg>
   <p>ON THE DEATH OF</p>
   <p>MR PURCELL .</p>
   <p>IN MUSIC .</p>
   <p>HENRY PURCELL , as a musician , is said by Burney to have been as much the pride of an Englishman , as Shakespeare in the drama , Milton in epic poetry , or Locke and Newton in their several departments of philosophy . He was born in 1658 , and died in 1695 , at the premature age of 37 years . Dryden , to whose productions he had frequently added the charms of music , devoted a tribute to his memory in the following verses , which , with others by inferior bards , were prefixed to a collection of Purcell 's music , published two years after his death , under the title of ORPHEUS BRITANNICUS . The Ode was set to music by Dr Blow , and performed at the concert in York Buildings . Dr Burney says , that the music is composed in fugue and imitation ; but appears laboured , and is wholly without invention or pathos .</p>
   <p>The “ Orpheus Britannicus ” being inscribed by the widow of Purcell to the Hon . Lady Howard , both Sir John Hawkins and Dr Burney have been led into the mistake of supposing , that the person so named was no other than Lady Elizabeth Dryden , our author 's wife . Mr Malone has detected this error ; and indeed the high compliments paid by the dedicator to Mr Purcell 's patroness , as an exquisite musician , a person of extensive influence , and one whose munificence had covered the remains of Purcell with “ a fair monument , ” are irreconcileable with the character , situation , and pecuniary circumstances of Lady Elizabeth Dryden . The Lady Howard of the dedication must , unquestionably , have been the wife of the Honourable Sir Robert Howard ; whence it follows , that the “ honourable gentleman , who had the dearest , and most deserved relation to her , and whose excellent compositions were the subject of Purcell 's last and best performances in music , ” was not our author , as has been erroneously supposed , but his brother-in-law , the said Sir Robert Howard , who continued to the last to be an occasional author , and to contribute songs to the dramatic performances of the day .<span corresp="#note94" type="note_anchor">[ 94 ]</span></p>
   <p>Although Dryden 's lady certainly did not erect Purcell 's monument , it is more than probable , judging from internal evidence , that the poet contributed the inscription , which runs thus :</p>
   <p>Here lies HENRY PURCELL , ESQ . Who left this life , And is gone to that blessed place , Where only his harmony can be exceeded .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Of the following ode , it may be briefly observed , that it displays much conceit , and little pathos , although the introductory simile is beautifully worded .</p>
   <note xml:id="note94" place="bottom" n="94">I have here inserted the Dedication which led to so singular a mistake , as the “ Orpheus Britannicus ” is a scarce book .— “ To the Honourable Lady Howard . Madam , Were it in the power of music to abate those strong impressions of grief which have continued upon me ever since the loss of my dear lamented husband , there are few , I believe , who are furnished with larger or better supplies of comfort from this science , than he has left me in his own compositions , and in the satisfaction I find , that they are not more valued by me , who must own myself fond to a partiality of all that was his , than by those who are no less judges than patrons of his performances . I find , madam , I have already said enough to justify the presumption of this application to your ladyship , who have added both these characters to the many excellent qualities which make you the admiration of all that know you .</note>
   <p>“ Your ladyship 's extraordinary skill in music , beyond most of either sex , and your great goodness to that dear person , whom you have sometimes been pleased to honour with the title of your master , makes it hard for me to judge whether he contributed more to the vast improvements you have made in that science , or your ladyship to the reputation he gained in the profession of it : For I have often heard him say , that , as several of his best compositions were originally designed for your ladyship 's entertainment , so the pains he bestowed in fitting them for your ear , were abundantly rewarded by the satisfaction he has received from your approbation and admirable performance of them , which has best recommended both them and their author to all that have had the happiness of hearing them from your ladyship .</p>
   <p>“ Another great advantage , to which my husband has often imputed the success of his labours , and which may best plead for your ladyship 's favourable acceptance of this collection , has been the great justness both of thought and numbers which he found in the poetry of our most refined writers , and among them , of that honourable gentleman , who has the dearest and most deserved relation to yourself , and whose excellent compositions were the subject of his last and best performances in music .</p>
   <p>“ Thus , madam , your ladyship has every way the justest titles to the patronage of this book ; the publication of which , under the auspicious influence of your name , is the best ( I had almost said the only ) means I have left , of testifying to the world , my desire to pay the last honours to its dear author , your ladyship having generously prevented my intended performance of the duty I owe to his ashes , by erecting a fair monument over them , and gracing it with an inscription which may perpetuate both the marble and his memory .</p>
   <p>“ Your generosity , which was too large to be confined either to his life or person , has also extended itself to his posterity , on whom your ladyship has been pleased to entail your favours , which must , with all gratitude , be acknowledged as the most valuable part of their inheritance , both by them , and your ladyship 's most obliged , and most humble servant ,</p>

   <p>EPITAPH</p>
   <p>ON THE</p>
   <p>MONUMENT</p>
   <p>OF</p>
   <p>THE MARQUIS OF WINCHESTER .</p>
   <p>John Powlet , fifth Marquis of Winchester , was remarkable for his steady loyalty to Charles I . He garrisoned for the king his fine castle at Basing , and underwent a siege of two years , from August 1643 to October 16th , 1645 ; on which day it was taken by Cromwell , by storm , after having been defended with great gallantry to the very last extremity . The Marquis had written , in every window of the house , with a diamond , the motto Aymez Loyaulté . The parliamentary leaders , incensed at this device , burned down this noble seat , ( a conflagration which Cromwell imputes to accident ,) and destroyed and plundered property to the amount of L. 200 , 000 . The Marquis himself was made prisoner . The particulars of this memorable siege were printed at Oxford , in 1645 ; and Oliver 's account of the storm is published in Collins 's “ Peerage , ” from a manuscript in the Museum . The Marquis of Winchester survived the Restoration ; and , having died premier marquis of England in 1674 , was buried at Englefield . This monument , upon which our author 's verses are engraved , is made of black and white marble ; and a compartment underneath the lines bears this inscription : “ The Lady Marchioness Dowager , in testimony of her love and sorrow , gave this monument to the memory of a most affectionate , tender husband . ” On a flat marble stone , beneath the monument , is the following epitaph : “ Here lieth interred the body of the most noble and mighty prince , John Powlet , Marquis of Winchester , Earl of Wiltshire , Baron of St John of Basing , first Marquis of England : A man of exemplary piety towards God , and of inviolable fidelity towards his sovereign ; in whose cause he fortified his house of Basing , and defended it against the rebels to the last extremity . He married three wives : the first was Jane , daughter of Thomas , Viscount Savage , and of Elizabeth his wife , daughter and co-heir of Thomas Darcey , Earl of Rivers ; by whom he had issue Charles , now Marquis of Winchester . His second wife was Honora , daughter of Richard Burgh , Earl of St Alban 's and Clanricarde , and of Frances , his wife , daughter and heir of Sir Francis Walsingham , knight , and principal secretary of state to Queen Elizabeth ; by whom he had issue four sons and three daughters . His last wife , who survived him , was Isabella , daughter of William , Viscount Stafford , second son of Thomas Howard , Earl of Arundel and Surrey , Earl Marshal of England , and of Mary his wife , sister and sole heir of Henry , Lord Stafford , who was the heir-male of the most high , mighty , and most noble Prince Edward , last Duke of Buckingham of that most illustrious name and family , by whom he had no issue . He died in the 77th year of his age , on the 5th of March , in the year of our Lord 1674 .— By Edward Walker , Garter King of Arms . ”</p>

   <note xml:id="note95" place="bottom" n="95">The following account of the manner in which Sir Palmes Fairbone fell , and of the revenge to which the author alludes , is taken from the Gazette of the time :</note>
   <p>“ Malaga , November 12 .— Three days since arrived here a small vessel , which stopped at Tangier , from whence we have letters , which give an account , that on the 2d instant , Sir Palmes Fairbone , the governor , as he was riding without the town with a party of horse , to observe what the Moors were doing , was shot by one of them , and , being mortally wounded , fell from his horse : That the Moors had intrenched themselves near the town , whereupon the whole garrison , consisting of 4000 horse and foot , sallied out upon them , commanded by Colonel Sackville : That they marched out in the night ; but were quickly discovered by the Moors ’ sentinels , who immediately gave the alarm : That in the morning there was a very sharp engagement , which lasted six hours ; and then the Moors , who were above 20 , 000 , fled , and were pursued by the English , who killed above 1500 of them , took four of their greatest guns , and filled up all the trenches , and then retired to the town with several prisoners , having obtained a most signal victory , wherein the Spanish horse behaved themselves as well as men could do . The day the said vessel came from Tangier , which was the 7th , they heard much shooting , which makes us believe there has been a second engagement .</p>
   <p>“ Malaga , November 12 , ( 1680 . ) — By a vessel arrived from Tangier , we have advice , that on Wednesday last all the force of that garrison took the field , and gave battle to about 30 , 000 Moors . The Spanish horse and 800 seamen marched in the van , the English horse with the main body . The fight lasted near six hours , with the slaughter of between 1500 and 2000 Moors , and of 150 of the garrison : That the Moors fled ; the English kept the field ; took six pieces of cannon , and six colours . Every soldier that brought in a flag had thirty guineas given to him ; and every one that took a Moor prisoner had him for his encouragement . There were about twenty taken ; and 300 bodies of Moors were dragged together in one heap , and as many heads in another pile . But the great misfortune was , that the Saturday before , the governor , as he was walking under the walls , received a mortal wound , which the Spanish horse so bravely resented , that immediately , without command , they mounted and charged the Moors with that courage , that they killed many of them , with the loss of seven or eight of themselves . Before this action , the Moors were so near the walls of the town , that with hand-slings they pelted our soldiers with stones . ” — London Gazette , No . 1567 .</p>
   <p>“ Whitehall , November 27 .— Yesterday morning arrived here Lieutenant-colonel Talmash from Tangier , and gave his Majesty an account , that Colonel Sackville , who has now the chief command , ( Sir Palmes Fairbone , the late governor , having been unfortunately wounded with a musket shot on the 24th past , of which he died three days after ,) finding that the Moors began to approach very near to Pole-fort , and were preparing to mine it , called a council of war , and , pursuant to what was there resolved , marched out on the 27th with 1500 foot and 300 horse , and fell upon the Moors with so much bravery , that , notwithstanding the inequality of their number , and the stout resistance they made , they beat them out of the trenches , and from their several lines , and gave them a total defeat ; pursuing them a mile into the country , with a great slaughter of them ; filling up their trenches , and levelling their lines , and taking two pieces of cannon , five colours , and several prisoners ; though with the loss of many officers and private soldiers killed and wounded on our side . ” — Ibidem , No . 1569 . ]</p>

   <p>FAIR MAIDEN LADY ,</p>
   <p>WHO DIED AT BATH ,</p>
   <p>AND IS THERE INTERRED .</p>
   <p>This lady lies buried in the Abbey-Church at Bath . The lines are accompanied by the following inscription upon a monument of white marble : “ Here lies the body of Mary , third daughter of Richard Frampton of Moreton , in Dorsetshire , Esq . and of Jane his wife , sole daughter of Sir Francis Cothington of Founthill , in Wilts , who was born January 1 , 1676 , and died , after seven weeks illness , on the 6th of September , 1698 .</p>

     <l n="6">One atom could be mixed of other clay ;</l>
     <l n="7">Such were the features of her heavenly face ,</l>
     <l n="8">Her limbs were formed with such harmonious grace :</l>
     <l n="9">So faultless was the frame , as if the whole</l>
     <l n="10">Had been an emanation of the soul ;</l>
     <l n="11">Which her own inward symmetry revealed ,</l>
     <l n="12">And like a picture shone , in glass annealed ;</l>
     <l n="13">Or like the sun eclipsed , with shaded light ;</l>
     <l n="14">Too piercing , else , to be sustained by sight .</l>
     <l n="15">Each thought was visible that rolled within ;</l>
     <l n="16">As through a crystal case the figured hours are seen .</l>
     <l n="17">And heaven did this transparent veil provide ,</l>
     <l n="18">Because she had no guilty thought to hide .</l>
     <l n="19">All white , a virgin-saint , she sought the skies ,</l>
     <l n="20">For marriage , though it sullies not , it dyes .</l>
     <l n="21">High though her wit , yet humble was her mind ; }</l>
     <l n="22">As if she could not , or she would not find }</l>
     <l n="23">How much her worth transcended all her kind . }</l>
     <l n="24">Yet she had learned so much of heaven below ,</l>
     <l n="25">That when arrived , she scarce had more to know ;</l>
     <l n="26">But only to refresh the former hint ,</l>
     <l n="27">And read her Maker in a fairer print .</l>
     <l n="28">So pious , as she had no time to spare</l>
     <l n="29">For human thoughts , but was confined to prayer ;</l>
     <l n="30">Yet in such charities she passed the day ,</l>
     <l n="31">‘ Twas wondrous how she found an hour to pray .</l>
     <l n="32">A soul so calm , it knew not ebbs or flows ,</l>
     <l n="33">Which passion could but curl , not discompose .</l>
     <l n="34">A female softness , with a manly mind ; }</l>
     <l n="35">A daughter duteous , and a sister kind ; }</l>
     <l n="36">In sickness patient , and in death resigned . }</l>

    <head>FAREWELL , FAIR ARMIDA .</head>

    <head>This Song was written on the death of Captain Digby , a younger son of the Earl of Bristol , who was killed in the great sea-fight between the English and Dutch , on the 28th May , 1672 . The relentless beauty to whom the lines were addressed , was Frances Stuart , Duchess of Richmond ; called in the Memoires de Grammont , La Belle Stuart . Count Hamilton there assures us , that her charms made conquest of Charles II . and were the occasion of much jealousy to the Countess of Castlemaine . Dryden 's song is parodied in “ The Rehearsal , ” in that made by “ Tom Thimble 's first wife after she was dead . ” “ Farewell , fair Armida , ” is printed in the Covent-Garden Drollery , 1672 , p. 16. where there is an exculpatory answer by the Lady , but of little merit .</head>

   <p>A SONG FOR ST CECILIA 'S DAY .</p>
   <p>ST CECILIA was , according to her legend , a Roman virgin of rank , who flourished during the reign of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus . She was a Christian , and , by her purity of life , and constant employment in the praises of her Maker , while yet on earth , obtained intercourse with an angel . Being married to Valerianus , a Pagan , she not only prevailed upon him to abstain from using any familiarity with her person , but converted him and his brother to Christianity . They were all martyrs for the faith in the reign of Septimius Severus . Chaucer has celebrated this legend in the “ Second Nonne 's Tale , ” which is almost a literal translation from the “ Golden Legend ” of Jacobus Januensis . As all professions and fraternities , in ancient times , made choice of a tutelar saint , Cecilia was elected the protectress of music and musicians . It was even believed that she had invented the organ , although no good authority can be discovered for such an assertion . Her festival was celebrated from an early period by those of the profession over whom she presided .</p>
   <p>The revival of letters , with the Restoration , was attended with a similar resuscitation of the musical art ; but the formation of a Musical Society , for the annual commemoration of St Cecilia 's day , did not take place until 1680 . An ode , written for the occasion , was set to music by the most able professor , and rehearsed before the society and their stewards upon the 22d November , the day dedicated to the patroness . The first effusions of this kind are miserable enough . Mr Malone has preserved a few verses of an ode , by an anonymous author , in 1633 ; that of 1684 was furnished by Oldham , whom our author has commemorated by an elegy ; that of 1685 was written by Nahum Tate , and is given by Mr Malone , Vol . I. p. 274 . There was no performance in 1686 ; and , in 1687 , Dryden furnished the following ode , which was set to music by Draghi , an eminent Italian composer . Of the annual festival , Motteux gives the following account :</p>
   <p>“ The 22d of November , being St Cecilia 's day , is observed throughout all Europe by the lovers of music . In Italy , Germany , France , and other countries , prizes are distributed on that day , in some of the most considerable towns , to such as make the best anthem in her praise .... On that day , or the next when it falls on a Sunday , ... most of the lovers of music , whereof many are persons of the first rank , meet at Stationers ’ Hall in London , not through a principle of superstition , but to propagate the advancement of that divine science . A splendid entertainment is provided , and before it is always a performance of music , by the best voices and hands in town : the words , which are always in the patronesses praise , are set by some of the greatest masters . This year<span type="note_anchor">[ 1691 ]</span>Dr John Blow , that famous musician , composed the music ; and Mr D'Urfey , whose skill in things of that nature is well known , made the words . Six stewards are chosen for each ensuing year ; four of which are either persons of quality or gentlemen of note , and the two last either gentlemen of their majesties music , or some of the chief masters in town .... This feast is one of the genteelest in the world ; there are no formalities nor gatherings as at others , and the appearance there is always very splendid . Whilst the company is at table , the hautboys and trumpets play successively . ”</p>
   <p>The merit of the following Ode has been so completely lost in that of “ Alexander 's Feast , ” that few readers give themselves even the trouble of attending to it . Yet the first stanza has exquisite merit ; and although the power of music is announced , in those which follow , in a manner more abstracted and general , and , therefore , less striking than when its influence upon Alexander and his chiefs is placed before our eyes , it is perhaps only our intimate acquaintance with the second ode that leads us to undervalue the first , although containing the original ideas , so exquisitely brought out and embodied in “ Alexander 's Feast . ”</p>

    <head>HIS GRACE</head>
    <head>THE</head>
    <head>DUKE OF ORMOND .<span corresp="#note98" type="note_anchor">[ 98 ]</span></head>
     <l n="1">Anno 1699 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>MY LORD ,</p>
   <p>Some estates are held , in England , by paying a fine at the change of every lord . I have enjoyed the patronage of your family , from the time of your excellent grandfather to this present day . I have dedicated the translations of the “ Lives of Plutarch ” to the first duke ;<span corresp="#note99" type="note_anchor">[ 99 ]</span>and have celebrated the memory of your heroic father .<span corresp="#note100" type="note_anchor">[ 100 ]</span>Though I am very short of the age of Nestor , yet I have lived to a third generation of your house ; and , by your grace 's favour , am admitted still to hold from you by the same tenure .</p>
   <p>I am not vain enough to boast , that I have deserved the value of so illustrious a line ; but my fortune is the greater , that , for three descents , they have been pleased to distinguish my poems from those of other men , and have accordingly made me their peculiar care . May it be permitted me to say , that as your grandfather and father were cherished and adorned with honours by two successive monarchs , so I have been esteemed and patronized by the grandfather , the father , and the son , descended from one of the most ancient , most conspicuous , and most deserving families in Europe .</p>
   <p>It is true , that by delaying the payment of my last fine , when it was due by your grace 's accession to the titles and patrimonies of your house , I may seem , in rigour of law , to have made a forfeiture of my claim ; yet my heart has always been devoted to your service ; and since you have been graciously pleased , by your permission of this address , to accept the tender of my duty , it is not yet too late to lay these poems at your feet .</p>
   <p>The world is sensible , that you worthily succeed not only to the honours of your ancestors , but also to their virtues . The long chain of magnanimity , courage , easiness of access , and desire of doing good , even to the prejudice of your fortune , is so far from being broken in your grace , that the precious metal yet runs pure to the newest link of it ; which I will not call the last , because I hope and pray it may descend to late posterity ; and your flourishing youth , and that of your excellent duchess , are happy omens of my wish .</p>
   <p>It is observed by Livy , and by others , that some of the noblest Roman families retained a resemblance of their ancestry , not only in their shapes and features , but also in their manners , their qualities , and the distinguishing characters of their minds . Some lines were noted for a stern , rigid virtue ; savage , haughty , parsimonious , and unpopular ; others were more sweet and affable , made of a more pliant paste , humble , courteous , and obliging ; studious of doing charitable offices , and diffusive of the goods which they enjoyed . The last of these is the proper and indelible character of your grace 's family . God Almighty has endued you with a softness , a beneficence , an attractive behaviour winning on the hearts of others , and so sensible of their misery , that the wounds of fortune seem not inflicted on them , but on yourself .<span corresp="#note101" type="note_anchor">[ 101 ]</span>You are so ready to redress , that you almost prevent their wishes , and always exceed their expectations ; as if what was yours was not your own , and not given you to possess , but to bestow on wanting merit . But this is a topic which I must cast in shades , lest I offend your modesty ; which is so far from being ostentatious of the good you do , that it blushes even to have it known ; and , therefore , I must leave you to the satisfaction and testimony of your own conscience , which , though it be a silent panegyric , is yet the best .</p>
   <p>You are so easy of access , that Poplicola<span corresp="#note102" type="note_anchor">[ 102 ]</span>was not more , whose doors were opened on the outside to save the people even the common civility of asking entrance ; where all were equally admitted ; where nothing that was reasonable was denied ; where misfortune was a powerful recommendation ; and where , I can scarce forbear saying , that want itself was a powerful mediator , and was next to merit .</p>
   <p>The history of Peru assures us , that their Incas , above all their titles , esteemed that the highest , which called them lovers of the poor ;— a name more glorious than the Felix , Pius , and Augustus , of the Roman emperors , which were epithets of flattery , deserved by few of them ; and not running in a blood like the perpetual gentleness , and inherent goodness , of the Ormond family .</p>
   <p>Gold , as it is the purest , so it is the softest and most ductile of all metals . Iron , which is the hardest , gathers rust , corrodes itself , and is , therefore , subject to corruption . It was never intended for coins and medals , or to bear the faces and inscriptions of the great . Indeed , it is fit for armour , to bear off insults , and preserve the wearer in the day of battle ; but , the danger once repelled , it is laid aside by the brave , as a garment too rough for civil conversation ; a necessary guard in war , but too harsh and cumbersome in peace , and which keeps off the embraces of a more humane life .</p>
   <p>For this reason , my lord , though you have courage in an heroical degree , yet I ascribe it to you but as your second attribute : mercy , beneficence , and compassion , claim precedence , as they are first in the divine nature . An intrepid courage , which is inherent in your grace , is at best but a holiday-kind of virtue , to be seldom exercised , and never but in cases of necessity ; affability , mildness , tenderness , and a word , which I would fain bring back to its original signification of virtue , I mean good-nature , are of daily use . They are the bread of mankind , and staff of life . Neither sighs , nor tears , nor groans , nor curses of the vanquished , follow acts of compassion and of charity ; but a sincere pleasure , and serenity of mind , in him who performs an action of mercy , which cannot suffer the misfortunes of another without redress , lest they should bring a kind of contagion along with them , and pollute the happiness which he enjoys .</p>
   <p>Yet since the perverse tempers of mankind , since oppression on one side , and ambition on the other , are sometimes the unavoidable occasions of war , that courage , that magnanimity , and resolution , which is born with you , cannot be too much commended : And here it grieves me that I am scanted in the pleasure of dwelling on many of your actions ; but αιδεομαι Τρωας is an expression which Tully often uses , when he would do what he dares not , and fears the censure of the Romans .</p>
   <p>I have sometimes been forced to amplify on others ; but here , where the subject is so fruitful , that the harvest overcomes the reaper , I am shortened by my chain , and can only see what is forbidden me to reach ; since it is not permitted me to commend you according to the extent of my wishes , and much less is it in my power to make my commendations equal to your merits .</p>
   <p>Yet , in this frugality of your praises , there are some things which I cannot omit , without detracting from your character . You have so formed your own education , as enables you to pay the debt you owe your country , or , more properly speaking , both your countries ; because you were born , I may almost say , in purple , at the castle of Dublin , when your grandfather was lord-lieutenant , and have since been bred in the court of England .</p>
   <p>If this address had been in verse , I might have called you , as Claudian calls Mercury , Numen commune , gemino faciens commercia mundo . The better to satisfy this double obligation , you have early cultivated the genius you have to arms , that when the service of Britain or Ireland shall require your courage and your conduct , you may exert them both to the benefit of either country . You began in the cabinet what you afterwards practised in the camp ; and thus both Lucullus and Cæsar ( to omit a crowd of shining Romans ) formed themselves to the war , by the study of history , and by the examples of the greatest captains , both of Greece and Italy , before their time . I name those two commanders in particular , because they were better read in chronicle than any of the Roman leaders ; and that Lucullus , in particular , having only the theory of war from books , was thought fit , without practice , to be sent into the field , against the most formidable enemy of Rome . Tully , indeed , was called the learned consul in derision ; but then he was not born a soldier ; his head was turned another way : when he read the tactics , he was thinking on the bar , which was his field of battle . The knowledge of warfare is thrown away on a general , who dares not make use of what he knows . I commend it only in a man of courage and resolution ; in him it will direct his martial spirit , and teach him the way to the best victories , which are those that are least bloody , and which , though achieved by the hand , are managed by the head . Science distinguishes a man of honour from one of those athletic brutes whom , undeservedly , we call heroes . Cursed be the poet , who first honoured with that name a mere Ajax , a man-killing idiot ! The Ulysses of Ovid upbraids his ignorance , that he understood not the shield for which he pleaded ; there was engraven on it plans of cities , and maps of countries , which Ajax could not comprehend , but looked on them as stupidly as his fellow-beast , the lion . But , on the other side , your grace has given yourself the education of his rival ; you have studied every spot of ground in Flanders , which , for these ten years past , has been the scene of battles , and of sieges . No wonder if you performed your part with such applause , on a theatre which you understood so well .</p>
   <p>If I designed this for a poetical encomium , it were easy to enlarge on so copious a subject ; but , confining myself to the severity of truth , and to what is becoming me to say , I must not only pass over many instances of your military skill , but also those of your assiduous diligence in the war , and of your personal bravery , attended with an ardent thirst of honour ; a long train of generosity ; profuseness of doing good ; a soul unsatisfied with all it has done , and an unextinguished desire of doing more . But all this is matter for your own historians ; I am , as Virgil says , Spatiis exclusus iniquis .</p>
   <p>Yet , not to be wholly silent of all your charities , I must stay a little on one action , which preferred the relief of others to the consideration of yourself . When , in the battle of Landen , your heat of courage ( a fault only pardonable to your youth ) had transported you so far before your friends , that they were unable to follow , much less to succour you ; when you were not only dangerously , but , in all appearance , mortally wounded ; when in that desperate condition you were made prisoner , and carried to Namur , at that time in possession of the French ;<span corresp="#note103" type="note_anchor">[ 103 ]</span>then it was , my lord , that you took a considerable part of what was remitted to you of your own revenues , and , as a memorable instance of your heroic charity , put it into the hands of Count Guiscard , who was governor of the place , to be distributed among your fellow-prisoners . The French commander , charmed with the greatness of your soul , accordingly consigned it to the use for which it was intended by the donor ; by which means the lives of so many miserable men were saved , and a comfortable provision made for their subsistence , who had otherwise perished , had you not been the companion of their misfortune ; or rather sent by Providence , like another Joseph , to keep out famine from invading those , whom , in humility , you called your brethren . How happy was it for those poor creatures , that your grace was made their fellow-sufferer ? And how glorious for you , that you chose to want , rather than not relieve the wants of others ? The heathen poet , in commending the charity of Dido to the Trojans , spoke like a Christian :</p>
   <p>Non ignara mali , miseris succurrere disco .</p>
   <p>All men , even those of a different interest , and contrary principles , must praise this action as the most eminent for piety , not only in this degenerate age , but almost in any of the former ; when men were made de meliore luto ; when examples of charity were frequent , and when there were in being ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">—— Teucri pulcherrima proles ,</l>
     <l n="2">Magnanimi heroes , nati melioribus annis .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>No envy can detract from this ; it will shine in history , and , like swans , grow whiter the longer it endures ; and the name of Ormond will be more celebrated in his captivity , than in his greatest triumphs .</p>
   <p>But all actions of your grace are of a piece , as waters keep the tenor of their fountains : your compassion is general , and has the same effect as well on enemies as friends . It is so much in your nature to do good , that your life is but one continued act of placing benefits on many ; as the sun is always carrying his light to some part or other of the world . And were it not that your reason guides you where to give , I might almost say , that you could not help bestowing more than is consisting with the fortune of a private man , or with the will of any but an Alexander .</p>
   <p>What wonder is it then , that , being born for a blessing to mankind , your supposed death in that engagement was so generally lamented through the nation ? The concernment for it was as universal as the loss ; and though the gratitude might be counterfeit in some , yet the tears of all were real : where every man deplored his private part in that calamity , and even those who had not tasted of your favours , yet built so much on the fame of your beneficence , that they bemoaned the loss of their expectations .</p>
   <p>This brought the untimely death of your great father into fresh remembrance ,— as if the same decree had passed on two short successive generations of the virtuous ; and I repeated to myself the same verses which I had formerly applied to him :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Ostendunt terris hunc tantum fata , neque ultra</l>
     <l n="2">Esse sinent .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But , to the joy not only of all good men , but mankind in general , the unhappy omen took not place . You are still living , to enjoy the blessings and applause of all the good you have performed , the prayers of multitudes whom you have obliged , for your long prosperity , and that your power of doing generous and charitable actions may be as extended as your will ; which is by none more zealously desired than by</p>
   <p>Your Grace 's most humble , Most obliged , and Most obedient servant , JOHN DRYDEN .</p>

   <p>PREFACE</p>
   <p>PREFIXED TO</p>
   <p>THE FABLES .</p>
   <p>It is with a poet , as with a man who designs to build , and is very exact , as he supposes , in casting up the cost beforehand ; but , generally speaking , he is mistaken in his account , and reckons short in the expence he first intended . He alters his mind as the work proceeds , and will have this or that convenience more , of which he had not thought when he began . So has it happened to me ; I have built a house , where I intended but a lodge ; yet with better success than a certain nobleman , who , beginning with a dog-kennel , never lived to finish the palace he had contrived .<span corresp="#note104" type="note_anchor">[ 104 ]</span></p>
   <p>From translating the First of Homer 's “ Iliads , ” ( which I intended as an essay to the whole work ,) I proceeded to the translation of the Twelfth Book of Ovid 's “ Metamorphoses , ” because it contains , among other things , the causes , the beginning , and ending , of the Trojan war . Here I ought in reason to have stopped ; but the speeches of Ajax and Ulysses lying next in my way , I could not balk them . When I had compassed them , I was so taken with the former part of the Fifteenth Book , which is the masterpiece of the whole “ Metamorphoses , ” that I enjoined myself the pleasing task of rendering it into English . And now I found , by the number of my verses , that they began to swell into a little volume ; which gave me an occasion of looking backward on some beauties of my author , in his former books : There occurred to me the “ Hunting of the Boar , ” “ Cinyras and Myrrha , ” the good-natured story of “ Baucis and Philemon , ” with the rest , which I hope I have translated closely enough , and given them the same turn of verse which they had in the original ;<span corresp="#note105" type="note_anchor">[ 105 ]</span>and this I may say , without vanity , is not the talent of every poet . He who has arrived the nearest to it , is the ingenious and learned Sandys , the best versifier of the former age ; if I may properly call it by that name , which was the former part of this concluding century . For Spenser and Fairfax both flourished in the reign of Queen Elizabeth ; great masters in our language , and who saw much farther into the beauties of our numbers , than those who immediately followed them . Milton was the poetical son of Spenser , and Mr Waller of Fairfax ; for we have our lineal descents and clans as well as other families . Spenser more than once insinuates , that the soul of Chaucer was transfused into his body ;<span corresp="#note106" type="note_anchor">[ 106 ]</span>and that he was begotten by him two hundred years after his decease . Milton has acknowledged to me , that Spenser was his original ; and many besides myself have heard our famous Waller own , that he derived the harmony of his numbers from “ Godfrey of Bulloigne , ” which was turned into English by Mr Fairfax .<span corresp="#note107" type="note_anchor">[ 107 ]</span></p>
   <p>But to return . Having done with Ovid for this time , it came into my mind , that our old English poet , Chaucer , in many things resembled him , and that with no disadvantage on the side of the modern author , as I shall endeavour to prove when I compare them ; and as I am , and always have been , studious to promote the honour of my native country , so I soon resolved to put their merits to the trial , by turning some of the “ Canterbury Tales ” into our language , as it is now refined ; for by this means , both the poets being set in the same light , and dressed in the same English habit , story to be compared with story , a certain judgment may be made betwixt them by the reader , without obtruding my opinion on him . Or , if I seem partial to my countryman and predecessor in the laurel , the friends of antiquity are not few ; and , besides many of the learned , Ovid has almost all the beaux , and the whole fair sex , his declared patrons . Perhaps I have assumed somewhat more to myself than they allow me , because I have adventured to sum up the evidence ; but the readers are the jury , and their privilege remains entire , to decide according to the merits of the cause ; or , if they please , to bring it to another hearing before some other court . In the mean time , to follow the thread of my discourse , ( as thoughts , according to Mr Hobbes , have always some connection ,) so from Chaucer I was led to think on Boccace , who was not only his contemporary , but also pursued the same studies ; wrote novels in prose , and many works in verse ; particularly is said to have invented the octave rhyme , or stanza of eight lines , which ever since has been maintained by the practice of all Italian writers , who are , or at least assume the title of heroic poets . He and Chaucer , among other things , had this in common , that they refined their mother-tongues ; but with this difference , that Dante had begun to file their language , at least in verse , before the time of Boccace , who likewise received no little help from his master Petrarch ; but the reformation of their prose was wholly owing to Boccace himself , who is yet the standard of purity in the Italian tongue , though many of his phrases are become obsolete , as , in process of time , it must needs happen . Chaucer ( as you have formerly been told by our learned Mr Rymer [ 108 ]) first adorned and amplified our barren tongue from the Provençal , which was then the most polished of all the modern languages ; but this subject has been copiously treated by that great critic , who deserves no little commendation from us his countrymen . For these reasons of time , and resemblance of genius , in Chaucer and Boccace , I resolved to join them in my present work ; to which I have added some original papers of my own , which , whether they are equal or inferior to my other poems , an author is the most improper judge ; and therefore I leave them wholly to the mercy of the reader . I will hope the best , that they will not be condemned ; but if they should , I have the excuse of an old gentleman , who , mounting on horseback before some ladies , when I was present , got up somewhat heavily , but desired of the fair spectators , that they would count fourscore and eight before they judged him . By the mercy of God , I am already come within twenty years of his number ; a cripple in my limbs ,— but what decays are in my mind the reader must determine . I think myself as vigorous as ever in the faculties of my soul , excepting only my memory , which is not impaired to any great degree ; and if I lose not more of it , I have no great reason to complain . What judgment I had , increases rather than diminishes ; and thoughts , such as they are , come crowding in so fast upon me , that my only difficulty is to chuse or to reject , to run them into verse , or to give them the other harmony of prose : I have so long studied and practised both , that they are grown into a habit , and become familiar to me . In short , though I may lawfully plead some part of the old gentleman 's excuse , yet I will reserve it till I think I have greater need , and ask no grains of allowance for the faults of this my present work , but those which are given of course to human frailty . I will not trouble my reader with the shortness of time in which I writ it , or the several intervals of sickness . They who think too well of their own performances , are apt to boast in their prefaces how little time their works have cost them , and what other business of more importance interfered ; but the reader will be as apt to ask the question , why they allowed not a longer time to make their works more perfect ? and why they had so despicable an opinion of their judges , as to thrust their indigested stuff upon them , as if they deserved no better ?</p>
   <p>With this account of my present undertaking , I conclude the first part of this discourse : in the second part , as at a second sitting , though I alter not the draught , I must touch the same features over again , and change the dead-colouring of the whole . In general I will only say , that I have written nothing which savours of immorality or profaneness ; at least , I am not conscious to myself of any such intention . If there happen to be found an irreverent expression , or a thought too wanton , they are crept into my verses through my inadvertency . If the searchers find any in the cargo , let them be staved or forfeited , like counterbanded goods ; at least , let their authors be answerable for them , as being but imported merchandize , and not of my own manufacture . On the other side , I have endeavoured to chuse such fables , both ancient and modern , as contain in each of them some instructive moral ; which I could prove by induction , but the way is tedious , and they leap foremost into sight , without the reader 's trouble of looking after them . I wish I could affirm , with a safe conscience , that I had taken the same care in all my former writings ; for it must be owned , that supposing verses are never so beautiful or pleasing , yet , if they contain any thing which shocks religion or good manners , they are at best what Horace says of good numbers without good sense , Versus inopes rerum , nugæque canoræ . Thus far , I hope , I am right in court , without renouncing to my other right of self-defence , where I have been wrongfully accused , and my sense wire-drawn into blasphemy , or bawdry , as it has often been by a religious lawyer ,<span corresp="#note109" type="note_anchor">[ 109 ]</span>in a late pleading against the stage ; in which he mixes truth with falsehood , and has not forgotten the old rule of calumniating strongly , that something may remain .</p>
   <p>I resume the thread of my discourse with the first of my translations , which was the first “ Ilias ” of Homer .<span corresp="#note110" type="note_anchor">[ 110 ]</span>If it shall please God to give me longer life , and moderate health , my intentions are to translate the whole “ Ilias ; ” provided still that I meet with those encouragements from the public , which may enable me to proceed in my undertaking with some cheerfulness . And this I dare assure the world beforehand , that I have found , by trial , Homer a more pleasing task than Virgil , though I say not the translation will be less laborious ; for the Grecian is more according to my genius than the Latin poet . In the works of the two authors we may read their manners , and natural inclinations , which are wholly different . Virgil was of a quiet , sedate temper ; Homer was violent , impetuous , and full of fire . The chief talent of Virgil was propriety of thoughts , and ornament of words : Homer was rapid in his thoughts , and took all the liberties , both of numbers and of expressions , which his language , and the age in which he lived , allowed him . Homer 's invention was more copious , Virgil 's more confined ; so that if Homer had not led the way , it was not in Virgil to have begun heroic poetry ; for nothing can be more evident , than that the Roman poem is but the second part of the “ Ilias ; ” a continuation of the same story , and the persons already formed . The manners of Æneas are those of Hector , superadded to those which Homer gave him . The adventures of Ulysses in the “ Odysses , ” are imitated in the first Six Books of Virgil 's “ Æneis ; ” and though the accidents are not the same , ( which would have argued him of a servile copying , and total barrenness of invention ,) yet the seas were the same in which both the heroes wandered ; and Dido cannot be denied to be the poetical daughter of Calypso . The six latter Books of Virgil 's poem are the four-and-twenty “ Iliads ” contracted ; a quarrel occasioned by a lady , a single combat , battles fought , and a town besieged . I say not this in derogation to Virgil , neither do I contradict any thing which I have formerly said in his just praise ; for his episodes are almost wholly of his own invention , and the form which he has given to the telling makes the tale his own , even though the original story had been the same . But this proves , however , that Homer taught Virgil to design ; and if invention be the first virtue of an epic poet , then the Latin poem can only be allowed the second place . Mr Hobbes , in the preface to his own bald translation of the “ Ilias , ” ( studying poetry as he did mathematics , when it was too late ,) Mr Hobbes ,<span corresp="#note111" type="note_anchor">[ 111 ]</span>I say , begins the praise of Homer where he should have ended it . He tells us , that the first beauty of an epic poem consists in diction ; that is , in the choice of words , and harmony of numbers . Now the words are the colouring of the work , which , in the order of nature , is last to be considered ; the design , the disposition , the manners , and the thoughts , are all before it : where any of those are wanting or imperfect , so much wants or is imperfect in the imitation of human life , which is in the very definition of a poem . Words , indeed , like glaring colours , are the first beauties that arise , and strike the sight ; but , if the draught be false or lame , the figures ill disposed , the manners obscure or inconsistent , or the thoughts unnatural , then the finest colours are but daubing , and the piece is a beautiful monster at the best . Neither Virgil nor Homer were deficient in any of the former beauties ; but in this last , which is expression , the Roman poet is at least equal to the Grecian , as I have said elsewhere : supplying the poverty of his language by his musical ear , and by his diligence .</p>
   <p>But to return . Our two great poets being so different in their tempers , one choleric and sanguine , the other phlegmatic and melancholic ; that which makes them excel in their several ways is , that each of them has followed his own natural inclination , as well in forming the design , as in the execution of it . The very heroes show their authors : Achilles is hot , impatient , revengeful ,</p>
   <p>Impiger , iracundus , inexorabilis , acer , &amp; c .</p>
   <p>Æneas patient , considerate , careful of his people , and merciful to his enemies ; ever submissive to the will of heaven :</p>
   <p>—— quò fata trahunt retrahuntque , sequamur .</p>
   <p>I could please myself with enlarging on this subject , but am forced to defer it to a fitter time . From all I have said , I will only draw this inference , that the action of Homer , being more full of vigour than that of Virgil , according to the temper of the writer , is of consequence more pleasing to the reader . One warms you by degrees ; the other sets you on fire all at once , and never intermits his heat . It is the same difference which Longinus makes betwixt the effects of eloquence in Demosthenes and Tully ; one persuades , the other commands . You never cool while you read Homer , even not in the Second Book ( a graceful flattery to his countrymen ) ; but he hastens from the ships , and concludes not that book till he has made you amends by the violent playing of a new machine . From thence he hurries on his action with variety of events , and ends it in less compass than two months . This vehemence of his , I confess , is more suitable to my temper ; and , therefore , I have translated his First Book with greater pleasure than any part of Virgil ; but it was not a pleasure without pains . The continual agitations of the spirits must needs be a weakening of any constitution , especially in age ; and many pauses are required for refreshment betwixt the heats ; the “ Ilias , ” of itself , being a third part longer than all Virgil 's works together .</p>
   <p>This is what I thought needful in this place to say of Homer . I proceed to Ovid and Chaucer ; considering the former only in relation to the latter . With Ovid ended the golden age of the Roman tongue ; from Chaucer the purity of the English tongue began . The manners of the poets were not unlike . Both of them were well-bred , well-natured , amorous , and libertine , at least in their writings ; it may be , also in their lives . Their studies were the same ,— philosophy and philology . Both of them were knowing in astronomy ; of which Ovid 's “ Books of the Roman Feasts , ” and Chaucer 's “ Treatise of the Astrolabe , ” are sufficient witnesses . But Chaucer was likewise an astrologer , as were Virgil , Horace , Persius , and Manilius . Both writ with wonderful facility and clearness ; neither were great inventors : for Ovid only copied the Grecian fables , and most of Chaucer 's stories were taken from his Italian contemporaries , or their predecessors . Boccace his “ Decameron ” was first published ; and from thence our Englishman has borrowed many of his “ Canterbury Tales . ” Yet that of “ Palamon and Arcite ” was written , in all probability , by some Italian wit , in a former age as I shall prove hereafter . The tale of “ Grisilde ” was the invention of Petrarch ; by him sent to Boccace , from whom it came to Chaucer .<span corresp="#note112" type="note_anchor">[ 112 ]</span>“ Troilus and Cressida ” was also written by a Lombard author ,<span corresp="#note113" type="note_anchor">[ 113 ]</span>but much amplified by our English translator , as well as beautified ; the genius of our countrymen in general , being rather to improve an invention than to invent themselves , as is evident not only in our poetry , but in many of our manufactures .— I find I have anticipated already , and taken up from Boccace before I come to him : but there is so much less behind ; and I am of the temper of most kings , who love to be in debt , are all for present money , no matter how they pay it afterwards : besides , the nature of a preface is rambling , never wholly out of the way , nor in it . This I have learned from the practice of honest Montaigne , and return at my pleasure to Ovid and Chaucer , of whom I have little more to say .</p>
   <p>Both of them built on the inventions of other men ; yet since Chaucer had something of his own , as “ The Wife of Bath 's Tale , ” “ The Cock and the Fox ,"[ 114 ] which I have translated , and some others , I may justly give our countryman the precedence in that part ; since I can remember nothing of Ovid which was wholly his . Both of them understood the manners ; under which name I comprehend the passions , and , in a larger sense , the descriptions of persons , and their very habits . For an example , I see Baucis and Philemon as perfectly before me , as if some ancient painter had drawn them ; and all the Pilgrims in the “ Canterbury Tales , ” their humours , their features , and the very dress , as distinctly as if I had supped with them at the Tabard<span corresp="#note115" type="note_anchor">[ 115 ]</span>in Southwark . Yet even there , too , the figures of Chaucer are much more lively , and set in a better light ; which though I have not time to prove , yet I appeal to the reader , and am sure he will clear me from partiality .— The thoughts and words remain to be considered , in the comparison of the two poets , and I have saved myself one half of that labour , by owning that Ovid lived when the Roman tongue was in its meridian ; Chaucer , in the dawning of our language : therefore that part of the comparison stands not on an equal foot , any more than the diction of Ennius and Ovid , or of Chaucer and our present English . The words are given up , as a post not to be defended in our poet , because he wanted the modern art of fortifying . The thoughts remain to be considered ; and they are to be measured only by their propriety ; that is , as they flow more or less naturally from the persons described , on such and such occasions . The vulgar judges , which are nine parts in ten of all nations , who call conceits and jingles wit , who see Ovid full of them , and Chaucer altogether without them , will think me little less than mad for preferring the Englishman to the Roman . Yet , with their leave , I must presume to say , that the things they admire are only glittering trifles , and so far from being witty , that in a serious poem they are nauseous , because they are unnatural . Would any man , who is ready to die for love , describe his passion like Narcissus ? Would he think of inopem me copia fecit , and a dozen more of such expressions , poured on the neck of one another , and signifying all the same thing ? If this were wit , was this a time to be witty , when the poor wretch was in the agony of death ? This is just John Littlewit , in “ Bartholomew Fair , ” who had a conceit ( as he tells you ) left him in his misery ; a miserable conceit . On these occasions the poet should endeavour to raise pity ; but , instead of this , Ovid is tickling you to laugh . Virgil never made use of such machines when he was moving you to commiserate the death of Dido : he would not destroy what he was building . Chaucer makes Arcite violent in his love , and unjust in the pursuit of it ; yet , when he came to die , he made him think more reasonably : he repents not of his love , for that had altered his character ; but acknowledges the injustice of his proceedings , and resigns Emilia to Palamon . What would Ovid have done on this occasion ? He would certainly have made Arcite witty on his death-bed ;— he had complained he was farther off from possession , by being so near , and a thousand such boyisms , which Chaucer rejected as below the dignity of the subject . They who think otherwise , would , by the same reason , prefer Lucan and Ovid to Homer and Virgil , and Martial to all four of them . As for the turn of words , in which Ovid particularly excels all poets , they are sometimes a fault , and sometimes a beauty , as they are used properly or improperly ; but in strong passions always to be shunned , because passions are serious , and will admit no playing . The French have a high value for them ; and , I confess , they are often what they call delicate , when they are introduced with judgment ; but Chaucer writ with more simplicity , and followed nature more closely than to use them .<span corresp="#note116" type="note_anchor">[ 116 ]</span>I have thus far , to the best of my knowledge , been an upright judge betwixt the parties in competition , not meddling with the design nor the disposition of it ; because the design was not their own ; and in the disposing of it they were equal .— It remains that I say somewhat of Chaucer in particular .</p>
   <p>In the first place , as he is the father of English poetry , so I hold him in the same degree of veneration as the Grecians held Homer , or the Romans Virgil . He is a perpetual fountain of good sense ; learned in all sciences ; and , therefore , speaks properly on all subjects . As he knew what to say , so he knows also when to leave off ; a continence which is practised by few writers , and scarcely by any of the ancients , excepting Virgil and Horace . One of our late great poets<span corresp="#note117" type="note_anchor">[ 117 ]</span>is sunk in his reputation , because he could never forgive any conceit which came in his way ; but swept , like a drag-net , great and small . There was plenty enough , but the dishes were ill sorted ; whole pyramids of sweet-meats for boys and women , but little of solid meat for men . All this proceeded not from any want of knowledge , but of judgment . Neither did he want that in discerning the beauties and faults of other poets , but only indulged himself in the luxury of writing ; and perhaps knew it was a fault , but hoped the reader would not find it . For this reason , though he must always be thought a great poet , he is no longer esteemed a good writer ; and for ten impressions , which his works have had in so many successive years , yet at present a hundred books are scarcely purchased once a twelvemonth ; for , as my last Lord Rochester said , though somewhat profanely , “ Not being of God , he could not stand . ”</p>
   <p>Chaucer followed nature every where , but was never so bold to go beyond her ; and there is a great difference of being poeta and nimis poeta , if we may believe Catullus , as much as betwixt a modest behaviour and affectation . The verse of Chaucer , I confess , is not harmonious to us ; but it is like the eloquence of one whom Tacitus commends , it was auribus istius temporis accommodata . They who lived with him , and some time after him , thought it musical ; and it continues so , even in our judgment , if compared with the numbers of Lidgate and Gower , his contemporaries :— there is the rude sweetness of a Scotch tune in it , which is natural and pleasing , though not perfect . It is true , I cannot go so far as he<span corresp="#note118" type="note_anchor">[ 118 ]</span>who published the last edition of him ; for he would make us believe the fault is in our ears , and that there were really ten syllables in a verse where we find but nine : but this opinion is not worth confuting ; it is so gross and obvious an error , that common sense ( which is a rule in every thing but matters of faith and revelation ) must convince the reader , that equality of numbers , in every verse which we call heroic , was either not known , or not always practised , in Chaucer 's age . It were an easy matter to produce some thousands of his verses , which are lame for want of half a foot , and sometimes a whole one , and which no pronunciation can make otherwise . We can only say , that he lived in the infancy of our poetry , and that nothing is brought to perfection at the first . We must be children before we grow men . There was an Ennius , and in process of time a Lucilius , and a Lucretius , before Virgil and Horace ; even after Chaucer there was a Spenser , a Harrington , a Fairfax , before Waller and Denham were in being ; and our numbers were in their nonage till these last appeared . I need say little of his parentage , life , and fortunes ; they are to be found at large in all the editions of his Works . He was employed abroad , and favoured , by Edward III ., Richard II ., and Henry IV ., and was poet , as I suppose , to all three of them .<span corresp="#note119" type="note_anchor">[ 119 ]</span>In Richard 's time , I doubt , he was a little dipt in the rebellion of the Commons ;<span corresp="#note120" type="note_anchor">[ 120 ]</span>and being brother-in-law to John of Gaunt , it was no wonder if he followed the fortunes of that family ; and was well with Henry IV . when he had deposed his predecessor . Neither is it to be admired , that Henry , who was a wise as well as a valiant prince , who claimed by succession , and was sensible that his title was not sound , but was rightfully in Mortimer , who had married the heir of York ; it was not to be admired , I say , if that great politician should be pleased to have the greatest wit of those times in his interests , and to be the trumpet of his praises . Augustus had given him the example , by the advice of Mæcenas , who recommended Virgil and Horace to him ; whose praises helped to make him popular while he was alive , and after his death have made him precious to posterity . As for the religion of our poet , he seems to have some little bias towards the opinions of Wickliffe , after John of Gaunt his patron ; somewhat of which appears in the tale of “ Pierce Plowman :"[ 121 ] yet I cannot blame him for inveighing so sharply against the vices of the clergy in his age : their pride , their ambition , their pomp , their avarice , their worldly interest , deserved the lashes which he gave them , both in that , and in most of his “ Canterbury Tales . ” Neither has his contemporary Boccace spared them : Yet both those poets lived in much esteem with good and holy men in orders ; for the scandal which is given by particular priests ’ reflects not on the sacred function . Chaucer 's Monk , his Canon , and his Friar , took not from the character of his Good Parson . A satirical poet is the check of the laymen on bad priests . We are only to take care , that we involve not the innocent with the guilty in the same condemnation . The good cannot be too much honoured , nor the bad too coarsely used ; for the corruption of the best becomes the worst . When a clergyman is whipped , his gown is first taken off , by which the dignity of his order is secured .<span corresp="#note122" type="note_anchor">[ 122 ]</span>If he be wrongfully accused , he has his action of slander ; and it is at the poet 's peril if he transgress the law . But they will tell us , that all kind of satire , though never so well deserved by particular priests , yet brings the whole order into contempt . Is then the peerage of England any thing dishonoured when a peer suffers for his treason ? If he be libelled , or any way defamed , he has his scandulum magnatum to punish the offender . They who use this kind of argument , seem to be conscious to themselves of somewhat which has deserved the poet 's lash , and are less concerned for their public capacity than for their private ; at least there is pride at the bottom of their reasoning . If the faults of men in orders are only to be judged among themselves , they are all in some sort parties ; for , since they say the honour of their order is concerned in every member of it , how can we be sure that they will be impartial judges ? How far I may be allowed to speak my opinion in this case , I know not ; but I am sure a dispute of this nature caused mischief in abundance betwixt a king of England and an archbishop of Canterbury ;<span corresp="#note123" type="note_anchor">[ 123 ]</span>one standing up for the laws of his land , and the other for the honour , as he called it , of God 's church ; which ended in the murder of the prelate , and in the whipping of his majesty from post to pillar for his penance . The learned and ingenious Dr Drake<span corresp="#note124" type="note_anchor">[ 124 ]</span>has saved me the labour of enquiring into the esteem and reverence which the priests have had of old ; and I would rather extend than diminish any part of it : yet I must needs say , that when a priest provokes me without any occasion given him , I have no reason , unless it be the charity of a Christian , to forgive him : prior læsit is justification sufficient in the civil law . If I answer him in his own language , self-defence , I am sure , must be allowed me ; and if I carry it farther , even to a sharp recrimination , somewhat may be indulged to human frailty . Yet my resentment has not wrought so far , but that I have followed Chaucer in his character of a holy man , and have enlarged on that subject with some pleasure ; reserving to myself the right , if I shall think fit hereafter , to describe another sort of priests , such as are more easily to be found than the Good Parson ; such as have given the last blow to Christianity in this age , by a practice so contrary to their doctrine . But this will keep cold till another time . In the mean while , I take up Chaucer where I left him .</p>
   <p>He must have been a man of a most wonderful comprehensive nature , because , as it has been truly observed of him , he has taken into the compass of his “ Canterbury Tales ” the various manners and humours ( as we now call them ) of the whole English nation , in his age . Not a single character has escaped him . All his pilgrims are severally distinguished from each other ; and not only in their inclinations , but in their very physiognomies and persons . Baptista Porta<span corresp="#note125" type="note_anchor">[ 125 ]</span>could not have described their natures better , than by the marks which the poet gives them . The matter and manner of their tales , and of their telling , are so suited to their different educations , humours , and callings , that each of them would be improper in any other mouth . Even the grave and serious characters are distinguished by their several sorts of gravity : their discourses are such as belong to their age , their calling , and their breeding ; such as are becoming of them , and of them only . Some of his persons are vicious , and some virtuous ; some are unlearned , or ( as Chaucer calls them ) lewd , and some are learned . Even the ribaldry of the low characters is different : the Reeve , the Miller , and the Cook , are several men , and distinguished from each other as much as the mincing Lady-Prioress and the broad-speaking , gap-toothed ,<span corresp="#note126" type="note_anchor">[ 126 ]</span>Wife of Bath . But enough of this ; there is such a variety of game springing up before me , that I am distracted in my choice , and know not which to follow . It is sufficient to say , according to the proverb , that here is God 's plenty . We have our forefathers and great-grand-dames all before us , as they were in Chaucer 's days : their general characters are still remaining in mankind , and even in England , though they are called by other names than those of monks , and friars , and canons , and lady-abbesses , and nuns ; for mankind is ever the same , and nothing lost out of nature , though every thing is altered . May I have leave to do myself the justice , ( since my enemies will do me none ,<span corresp="#note127" type="note_anchor">[ 127 ]</span>and are so far from granting me to be a good poet , that they will not allow me so much as to be a Christian , or a moral man ,) may I have leave , I say , to inform my reader , that I have confined my choice to such tales of Chaucer as savour nothing of immodesty . If I had desired more to please than to instruct , the Reeve , the Miller , the Shipman , the Merchant , the Sumner , and , above all , the Wife of Bath , in the prologue to her tale , would have procured me as many friends and readers , as there are beaux and ladies of pleasure in the town . But I will no more offend against good manners . I am sensible , as I ought to be , of the scandal I have given by my loose writings ; and make what reparation I am able , by this public acknowledgment . If any thing of this nature , or of profaneness , be crept into these poems , I am so far from defending it , that I disown it , totum hoc indictum volo . Chaucer makes another manner of apology for his broad speaking , and Boccace makes the like ; but I will follow neither of them . Our countryman , in the end of his characters , before the “ Canterbury Tales , ” thus excuses the ribaldry , which is very gross in many of his novels :</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Yet if a man should have inquired of Boccace or of Chaucer , what need they had of introducing such characters , where obscene words were proper in their mouths , but very indecent to be heard ? I know not what answer they could have made ; for that reason , such tale shall be left untold by me . You have here a specimen of Chaucer 's language , which is so obsolete , that his sense is scarce to be understood ; and you have likewise more than one example of his unequal numbers , which were mentioned before . Yet many of his verses consist of ten syllables , and the words not much behind our present English : as for example , these two lines , in the description of the carpenter 's young wife :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Winsing she was , as is a jolly colt ,</l>
     <l n="2">Long as a mast , and upright as a bolt .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I have almost done with Chaucer , when I have answered some objections relating to my present work . I find some people are offended that I have turned these tales into modern English ; because they think them unworthy of my pains , and look on Chaucer as a dry , old-fashioned wit , not worthy reviving . I have often heard the late Earl of Leicester<span corresp="#note128" type="note_anchor">[ 128 ]</span>say , that Mr Cowley himself was of that opinion ; who , having read him over at my lord 's request , declared he had no taste of him . I dare not advance my opinion against the judgment of so great an author ; but I think it fair , however , to leave the decision to the public . Mr Cowley was too modest to set up for a dictator ; and being shocked perhaps with his old style , never examined into the depth of his good sense . Chaucer , I confess , is a rough diamond , and must first be polished , ere he shines . I deny not likewise , that , living in our early days of poetry , he writes not always of a piece ; but sometimes mingles trivial things with those of greater moment . Sometimes also , though not often , he runs riot , like Ovid , and knows not when he has said enough . But there are more great wits beside Chaucer , whose fault is their excess of conceits , and those ill sorted . An author is not to write all he can , but only all he ought . Having observed this redundancy in Chaucer , ( as it is an easy matter for a man of ordinary parts to find a fault in one of greater ,) I have not tied myself to a literal translation ; but have often omitted what I judged unnecessary , or not of dignity enough to appear in the company of better thoughts . I have presumed farther , in some places , and added somewhat of my own where I thought my author was deficient , and had not given his thoughts their true lustre , for want of words in the beginning of our language . And to this I was the more emboldened , because ( if I may be permitted to say it of myself ) I found I had a soul congenial to his , and that I had been conversant in the same studies . Another poet , in another age , may take the same liberty with my writings ; if at least they live long enough to deserve correction . It was also necessary sometimes to restore the sense of Chaucer , which was lost or mangled in the errors of the press . Let this example suffice at present : in the story of Palamon and Arcite , where the temple of Diana is described , you find these verses , in all the editions of our author :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Ther saw I Dane yturned til a tree ,</l>
     <l n="2">I mene not hire the goddesse Diane ,</l>
     <l n="3">But Venus daughter , which that hight Dane .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>which , after a little consideration , I knew was to be reformed into this sense ,— that Daphne , the daughter of Peneus , was turned into a tree .<span corresp="#note129" type="note_anchor">[ 129 ]</span>I durst not make thus bold with Ovid , lest some future Milbourne should arise , and say , I varied from my author , because I understood him not .</p>
   <p>But there are other judges , who think I ought not to have translated Chaucer into English , out of a quite contrary notion : they suppose there is a certain veneration due to his old language ; and that it is little less than profanation and sacrilege to alter it . They are farther of opinion , that somewhat of his good sense will suffer in this transfusion , and much of the beauty of his thoughts will infallibly be lost , which appear with more grace in their old habit . Of this opinion was that excellent person , whom I mentioned , the late Earl of Leicester , who valued Chaucer as much as Mr Cowley despised him . My lord dissuaded me from this attempt , ( for I was thinking of it some years before his death ,) and his authority prevailed so far with me , as to defer my undertaking while he lived , in deference to him : yet my reason was not convinced with what he urged against it . If the first end of a writer be to be understood , then , as his language grows obsolete , his thoughts must grow obscure :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Multa renascentur , quæ jam cecidere ; cadentque</l>
     <l n="2">Quæ nunc sunt in honore vocabula , si volet usus ,</l>
     <l n="3">Quem penes arbitrium est et jus et norma loquendi .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>When an ancient word , for its sound and significancy , deserves to be revived , I have that reasonable veneration for antiquity to restore it . All beyond this is superstition . Words are not like landmarks , so sacred as never to be removed ; customs are changed , and even statutes are silently repealed , when the reason ceases for which they were enacted . As for the other part of the argument ,— that his thoughts will lose of their original beauty by the innovation of words ,— in the first place , not only their beauty , but their being is lost , where they are no longer understood , which is the present case . I grant that something must be lost in all transfusion , that is , in all translations ; but the sense will remain , which would otherwise be lost , or at least be maimed , when it is scarce intelligible , and that but to a few . How few are there , who can read Chaucer , so as to understand him perfectly ? And if imperfectly , then with less profit , and no pleasure . It is not for the use of some old Saxon friends , that I have taken these pains with him : let them neglect my version , because they have no need of it . I made it for their sakes , who understand sense and poetry as well as they , when that poetry and sense is put into words which they understand . I will go farther , and dare to add , that what beauties I lose in some places , I give to others which had them not originally : but in this I may be partial to myself ; let the reader judge , and I submit to his decision . Yet I think I have just occasion to complain of them , who , because they understand Chaucer , would deprive the greater part of their countrymen of the same advantage , and hoard him up , as misers do their grandam gold , only to look on it themselves , and hinder others from making use of it . In sum , I seriously protest , that no man ever had , or can have , a greater veneration for Chaucer than myself . I have translated some part of his works , only that I might perpetuate his memory , or at least refresh it , amongst my countrymen . If I have altered him any where for the better , I must at the same time acknowledge , that I could have done nothing without him . Facile est inventis addere is no great commendation ; and I am not so vain to think I have deserved a greater . I will conclude what I have to say of him singly , with this one remark : A lady of my acquaintance , who keeps a kind of correspondence with some authors of the fair sex in France , has been informed by them , that Mademoiselle de Scuderi , who is as old as Sibyl , and inspired like her by the same god of poetry , is at this time translating Chaucer into modern French .<span corresp="#note130" type="note_anchor">[ 130 ]</span>From which I gather , that he has been formerly translated into the old Provençal ; for how she should come to understand old English , I know not . But the matter of fact being true , it makes me think that there is something in it like fatality ; that , after certain periods of time , the fame and memory of great wits should be renewed , as Chaucer is both in France and England . If this be wholly chance , it is extraordinary ; and I dare not call it more , for fear of being taxed with superstition .</p>
   <p>Boccace comes last to be considered , who , living in the same age with Chaucer , had the same genius , and followed the same studies . Both writ novels , and each of them cultivated his mother tongue . But the greatest resemblance of our two modern authors being in their familiar style , and pleasing way of relating comical adventures , I may pass it over , because I have translated nothing from Boccace of that nature . In the serious part of poetry , the advantage is wholly on Chaucer 's side ; for though the Englishman has borrowed many tales from the Italian , yet it appears , that those of Boccace were not generally of his own making , but taken from authors of former ages , and by him only modelled ; so that what there was of invention , in either of them , may be judged equal . But Chaucer has refined on Boccace , and has mended the stories , which he has borrowed , in his way of telling ; though prose allows more liberty of thought , and the expression is more easy when unconfined by numbers . Our countryman carries weight , and yet wins the race at disadvantage . I desire not the reader should take my word ; and , therefore , I will set two of their discourses , on the same subject , in the same light , for every man to judge betwixt them . I translated Chaucer first , and , amongst the rest , pitched on the “ Wife of Bath 's Tale ; ” not daring , as I have said , to adventure on her prologue , because it is too licentious .<span corresp="#note131" type="note_anchor">[ 131 ]</span>There Chaucer introduces an old woman , of mean parentage , whom a youthful knight , of noble blood , was forced to marry , and consequently loathed her . The crone , being in bed with him , on the wedding-night , and finding his aversion , endeavours to win his affection by reason , and speaks a good word for herself , ( as who could blame her ? ) in hope to mollify the sullen bridegroom . She takes her topics from the benefits of poverty , the advantages of old age and ugliness , the vanity of youth , and the silly pride of ancestry and titles , without inherent virtue , which is the true nobility . When I had closed Chaucer , I returned to Ovid , and translated some more of his fables ; and , by this time , had so far forgotten the “ Wife of Bath 's Tale , ” that , when I took up Boccace , unawares I fell on the same argument , of preferring virtue to nobility of blood and titles , in the story of Sigismunda ; which I had certainly avoided , for the resemblance of the two discourses , if my memory had not failed me . Let the reader weigh them both ; and , if he thinks me partial to Chaucer , it is in him to right Boccace .</p>
   <p>I prefer , in our countryman , far above all his other stories , the noble poem of “ Palamon and Arcite , ” which is of the epic kind , and perhaps not much inferior to the Ilias , or the Æneis . The story is more pleasing than either of them , the manners as perfect , the diction as poetical , the learning as deep and various , and the disposition full as artful , only it includes a greater length of time , as taking up seven years at least : but Aristotle has left undecided the duration of the action , which yet is easily reduced into the compass of a year , by a narration of what preceded the return of Palamon to Athens . I had thought , for the honour of our nation , and more particularly for his , whose laurel , though unworthy , I have worn after him , that this story was of English growth , and Chaucer 's own : but I was undeceived by Boccace ; for , casually looking on the end of his seventh Giornata , I found Dioneo ( under which name he shadows himself ,) and Fiametta , ( who represents his mistress , the natural daughter of Robert , king of Naples ,) of whom these words are spoken :— “ Dioneo e Fiametta gran pezza Eantarono insieme d'Arcita , e di Palemone ; ” by which it appears , that this story was written before the time of Boccace ; but the name of its author being wholly lost , Chaucer is now become an original ; and I question not but the poem has received many beauties , by passing through his noble hands .<span corresp="#note132" type="note_anchor">[ 132 ]</span>Besides this tale , there is another of his own invention , after the manner of the Provençals , called “ The Flower and the Leaf , ” with which I was so particularly pleased , both for the invention and the moral , that I cannot hinder myself from recommending it to the reader .</p>
   <p>As a corollary to this preface , in which I have done justice to others , I owe somewhat to myself ; not that I think it worth my time to enter the lists with one Milbourne , and one Blackmore , but barely to take notice , that such men there are , who have written scurrilously against me , without any provocation . Milbourne , who is in orders , pretends , amongst the rest , this quarrel to me , that I have fallen foul on priesthood : if I have , I am only to ask pardon of good priests , and am afraid his part of the reparation will come to little .<span corresp="#note133" type="note_anchor">[ 133 ]</span>Let him be satisfied , that he shall not be able to force himself upon me for an adversary . I contemn him too much to enter into competition with him . His own translations of Virgil have answered his criticisms on mine . If , as they say , he has declared in print , he prefers the version of Ogilby to mine , the world has made him the same compliment ; for it is agreed , on all hands , that he writes even below Ogilby . That , you will say , is not easily to be done ; but what cannot Milbourne bring about ? I am satisfied , however , that , while he and I live together , I shall not be thought the worst poet of the age . It looks , as if I had desired him , underhand , to write so ill against me ; but , upon my honest word , I have not bribed him to do me this service , and am wholly guiltless of his pamphlet . It is true , I should be glad if I could persuade him to continue his good offices , and write such another critique on any thing of mine ; for I find , by experience , he has a great stroke with the reader , when he condemns any of my poems , to make the world have a better opinion of them . He has taken some pains with my poetry ; but nobody will be persuaded to take the same with his . If I had taken to the church , as he affirms , but which was never in my thoughts , I should have had more sense , if not more grace , than to have turned myself out of my benefice , by writing libels on my parishioners . But his account of my manners , and my principles , is of a piece with his cavils and his poetry ; and so I have done with him for ever .</p>
   <p>As for the City Bard , or Knight Physician , I hear his quarrel to me is , that I was the author of “ Absalom and Achitophel , ” which , he thinks , is a little hard on his fanatic patrons in London .</p>
   <p>But I will deal the more civilly with his two poems , because nothing ill is to be spoken of the dead ; and , therefore , peace be to the manes of his “ Arthurs . "[ 134 ] I will only say , that it was not for this noble knight that I drew the plan of an epic poem on King Arthur , in my preface to the translation of Juvenal . The guardian angels of kingdoms were machines too ponderous for him to manage ; and therefore he rejected them , as Dares did the whirlbats of Eryx , when they were thrown before him by Entellus : yet from that preface , he plainly took his hint ; for he began immediately upon the story , though he had the baseness not to acknowledge his benefactor , but , instead of it , to traduce me in a libel .</p>
   <p>I shall say the less of Mr Collier , because in many things he has taxed me justly ; and I have pleaded guilty to all thoughts and expressions of mine , which can be truly argued of obscenity , profaneness , or immorality , and retract them . If he be my enemy , let him triumph ; if he be my friend , as I have given him no personal occasion to be otherwise , he will be glad of my repentance . It becomes me not to draw my pen in the defence of a bad cause , when I have so often drawn it for a good one . Yet it were not difficult to prove , that , in many places , he has perverted my meaning by his glosses , and interpreted my words into blasphemy and bawdry , of which they were not guilty ; besides , that he is too much given to horse-play in his raillery , and comes to battle like a dictator from the plough . I will not say , “ the zeal of God 's house has eaten him up ; ” but I am sure it has devoured some part of his good manners and civility . It might also be doubted , whether it were altogether zeal which prompted him to this rough manner of proceeding ; perhaps , it became not one of his function to rake into the rubbish of ancient and modern plays : a divine might have employed his pains to better purpose , than in the nastiness of Plautus and Aristophanes , whose examples , as they excuse not me , so it might be possibly supposed , that he read them not without some pleasure . They , who have written commentaries on those poets , or on Horace , Juvenal , and Martial , have explained some vices , which , without their interpretation , had been unknown to modern times . Neither has he judged impartially betwixt the former age and us . There is more bawdry in one play of Fletcher 's , called “ The Custom of the Country , ” than in all ours together .<span corresp="#note135" type="note_anchor">[ 135 ]</span>Yet this has been often acted on the stage , in my remembrance . Are the times so much more reformed now , than they were five-and-twenty years ago ? If they are , I congratulate the amendment of our morals . But I am not to prejudice the cause of my fellow poets , though I abandon my own defence : they have some of them answered for themselves ; and neither they nor I can think Mr Collier so formidable an enemy , that we should shun him . He has lost ground , at the latter end of the day , by pursuing his point too far , like the Prince of Condé , at the battle of Senneph :[ 136 ] from immoral plays , to no plays , ab abusu ad usum , non valet consequentia . But , being a party , I am not to erect myself into a judge . As for the rest of those who have written against me , they are such scoundrels , that they deserve not the least notice to be taken of them . Blackmore and Milbourne are only distinguished from the crowd , by being remembered to their infamy :</p>

Boccacio tells the story of Griselda in his “ Decameron , ” which was written about 1160 , and Petrarch did not translate it till 1173 , the year of his death , when he executed a Latin version of it . Even then , he mentions it as a traditional tale , which he had often heard with pleasure . The original edition of the story is difficult to discover . Noguier , in his “ Histoire de Tholouse , ” affirms , that this mirror of female patience actually existed about the year 1103 , and Le Grand lays claim to her history as originally a French fabliau . It seems certain , at least , that it was not invented by Petrarch , although Chaucer quotes his authority , probably that he might introduce a panegyric on his departed friend :</note>

   <note xml:id="note113" place="bottom" n="113">Tyrwhitt has laboured to show , that Boccacio 's poem , called the “ Philostrato , ” contains the original of Chaucer 's “ Troilus and Creseide . ” But Chaucer himself calls his original “ Lollius ” and the Book “ Trophe ; ” and I think , with Mr Godwin , that we are not hastily to conclude that this was an invention , to disguise his pillaging Boccacio , when we consider the probability of the work , which served as their common original , being lost in the course of so many ages . See this question discussed in Godwin 's “ Life of Chaucer , ” Vol . I. p 263 .</note>
   <note xml:id="note114" place="bottom" n="114">Unquestionably these poems are original as to the mode of treating them ; but , in both cases , Chaucer was contented to adopt the story of some more ancient tale-teller . The “ Wife of Bath 's Tale ” is imitated from the “ Florent ” in Gower , and that probably from the work of an older minstrel . Or Chaucer may have copied the old tale called the “ Marriage of Sir Gawain , ” which is probably the corrupted fragment of a metrical romance . The apologue of “ The Cock and the Fox , ” is to be found in the “ Fables ” of Marie of France , who seems to have lived in the reign of Henry III . of England .</note>

   <note xml:id="note118" place="bottom" n="118">Thomas Speght 's edition of Chaucer was published in 1597 and 1602 . The preface contains the passage which Dryden alludes to : “ And for his ( Chaucer 's ) verses , although , in divers places , they seem to us to stand of unequal measures , yet a skilful reader , who can scan them in their nature , shall find it otherwise . And if a verse , here and there , fal out a syllable shorter or longer than another , I rather aret it to the negligence and rape of Adam Scrivener , ( that I may speake as Chaucer doth ) than to any unconning or oversight in the author : For how fearful he was to have his works miswritten , or his verse mismeasured , may appeare in the end of his fift booke of “ Troylus and Creseide , ” where he writeth thus :</note>

   </lg>
   <p>By his hasty and inconsiderate contradiction of honest Speght 's panegyric , Dryden has exposed himself to be censured for pronouncing rashly upon a subject with which he was but imperfectly acquainted . The learned Tyrwhitt has supported Speght 's position with equal pains and success , and plainly proves , that the apparent inequalities of the rhyme of Chaucer , arise chiefly from the change in pronunciation since his time , particularly from a number of words being now pronounced as one syllable , which in those days were prolonged into two , or as two syllables which were anciently three . These researches , in the words of Ellis , “ have proved what Dryden denied , viz . that Chaucer 's versification , wherever his genuine text is preserved , was uniformly correct , although the harmony of his lines has , in many cases , been obliterated by the changes that have taken place in the mode of accenting our language . ” — Specimens of the Early English Poets , Vol .

   <note xml:id="note119" place="bottom" n="119">Chaucer was doubtless employed and trusted by Edward and by his grandson , and probably favoured by Henry IV ., the son of his original patron ; but if Dryden meant , that he held , during these reigns , the precise office of poet-laureat , once enjoyed by himself , it is difficult to suppose that any such had existence .</note>

Dryden probably was sufficiently ready to adopt any authority which seemed to countenance severity against the churchmen ,— a subject upon which he always flies into declamation .</note>

   <p>“ Some of these poets , to excuse their guilt , allege for themselves , that the degeneracy of the age makes their lewd way of writing necessary . They pretend , the auditors will not be pleased , unless they are thus entertained from the stage ; and to please , they say , is the chief business of the poet . But this is by no means a just apology . It is not true , as was said before , that the poet 's chief business is to please : his chief business is to instruct , to make mankind wiser and better ; and , in order to this , his care should be to please and entertain the audience , with all the wit and art he is master of . Aristotle and Horace , and all their critics and commentators , all men of wit and sense , agree , that this is the end of poetry . But they say , it is their profession to write for the stage ; and that poets must starve , if they will not , in this way , humour the audience ; the theatre will be as unfrequented as the churches , and the poet and the parson equally neglected . Let the poet , then , abandon his profession , and take up some honest , lawful , calling ; where , joining industry to his great wit , he may soon get above the complaints of poverty , so common among these ingenious men , and lie under no necessity of prostituting his wit , to any such vile purposes as are here censured . This will be a course of life more profitable and honourable to himself , and more useful to others . And there are , among these writers , some , who think they might have risen to the highest dignities , in other professions , had they employed their wit in those ways . It is a mighty dishonour and reproach to any man that is capable of being useful to the world , in any liberal and virtuous profession , to lavish out his life and wit , in propagating vice and corruption of manners , and in battering , from the stage , the strongest entrenchments , and best works , of religion and virtue . Whoever makes this his choice , when the other was in his power , may he go off the stage unpitied , complaining of neglect and poverty , the just punishments of his irreligion and folly . ” ]</p>

   <p>PALAMON AND ARCITE ;</p>
   <p>OR ,</p>
   <p>THE KNIGHT 'S TALE .</p>
   <p>PALAMON AND ARCITE .</p>
   <p>“ The Knight 's Tale , ” whether we consider Chaucer 's original poem , or the spirited and animated version of Dryden , is one of the finest pieces of composition in our language . We have treated of its merits so amply in the general criticism on Dryden 's poetry , that little remains here save to trace the antiquity of the fable .</p>
   <p>The history of Theseus , as , indeed , it is a sort of legend of knight-errantry , was an early favourite during the middle ages . It is probable , that the anecdote of Palamon and Arcite was early engrafted upon the story of the siege of Thebes . But the original from which Chaucer appears to have immediately derived his materials , is the “ Teseide ” of Boccacio , an epic poem , composed in ottava rima , of which Tyrwhitt has given an analysis . The work of Chaucer cannot , however , properly be termed a translation ; on the contrary , the tale has acquired its most beautiful passages under the hand of the English bard . He abridged the prolix , and enlarged the poetical , parts of the work ; compressed the whole into one concise and interesting tale ; and left us an example of a beautiful heroic poem , if a work is entitled to that name which consists only of two thousand lines .</p>
   <p>This romantic legend is , by Chaucer , with great propriety , put into the mouth of the Knight , a distinguished character among the Pilgrims ; who , in their journey to the shrine of St Thomas at Canterbury , had agreed to beguile the way by telling each a tale in turn . Hence the second title of “ The Knight 's Tale . ”</p>

    <head>THE KNIGHT 'S TALE .</head>
    <head>BOOK I .</head>
     <l n="1">In days of old , there lived , of mighty fame ,</l>
     <l n="2">A valiant prince , and Theseus was his name ;</l>
     <l n="3">A chief , who more in feats of arms excelled ,</l>
     <l n="4">The rising nor the setting sun beheld .</l>
     <l n="5">Of Athens he was lord ; much land he won ,</l>
     <l n="6">And added foreign countries to his crown .</l>
     <l n="7">In Scythia with the warrior queen he strove ,</l>
     <l n="8">Whom first by force he conquered , then by love ;</l>
     <l n="9">He brought in triumph back the beauteous dame ,</l>
     <l n="10">With whom her sister , fair Emilia , came .</l>
     <l n="11">With honour to his home let Theseus ride , }</l>
     <l n="12">With love to friend , and fortune for his guide , }</l>
     <l n="13">And his victorious army at his side . }</l>
     <l n="14">I pass their warlike pomp , their proud array ,</l>
     <l n="15">Their shouts , their songs , their welcome on the way ;</l>
     <l n="16">But , were it not too long , I would recite }</l>
     <l n="17">The feats of Amazons , the fatal fight }</l>
     <l n="18">Betwixt the hardy queen , and hero knight ; }</l>
     <l n="19">The town besieged , and how much blood it cost</l>
     <l n="20">The female army , and the Athenian host ;</l>
     <l n="21">The spousals of Hippolita the queen ;</l>
     <l n="22">What tilts and tourneys at the feast were seen ;</l>
     <l n="23">The storm at their return , the ladies ’ fear ;</l>
     <l n="24">But these , and other things , I must forbear .</l>
     <l n="25">The field is spacious I design to sow ,</l>
     <l n="26">With oxen far unfit to draw the plow :</l>
     <l n="27">The remnant of my tale is of a length</l>
     <l n="28">To tire your patience , and to waste my strength ;</l>
     <l n="29">And trivial accidents shall be forborne ,</l>
     <l n="30">That others may have time to take their turn ;</l>
     <l n="31">As was at first enjoined us by mine host , }</l>
     <l n="32">That he whose tale is best , and pleases most , }</l>
     <l n="33">Should win his supper at our common cost . }</l>
     <l n="34">And therefore where I left , I will pursue }</l>
     <l n="35">This ancient story , whether false or true , }</l>
     <l n="36">In hope it may be mended with a new . }</l>
     <l n="37">The prince I mentioned , full of high renown ,</l>
     <l n="38">In this array drew near the Athenian town ;</l>
     <l n="39">When in his pomp and utmost of his pride ,</l>
     <l n="40">Marching , he chanced to cast his eye aside ,</l>
     <l n="41">And saw a choir of mourning dames , who lay ,</l>
     <l n="42">By two and two , across the common way :</l>
     <l n="43">At his approach they raised a rueful cry ,</l>
     <l n="44">And beat their breasts , and held their hands on high ;</l>
     <l n="45">Creeping and crying , till they seized at last ,</l>
     <l n="46">His courser 's bridle , and his feet embraced .</l>
     <l n="47">Tell me , said Theseus , what and whence you are ,</l>
     <l n="48">And why this funeral pageant you prepare ?</l>
     <l n="49">Is this the welcome of my worthy deeds ,</l>
     <l n="50">To meet my triumph , in ill-omened weeds ?</l>
     <l n="51">Or envy you my praise , and would destroy</l>
     <l n="52">With grief my pleasures , and pollute my joy ?</l>
     <l n="53">Or are you injured , and demand relief ?</l>
     <l n="54">Name your request , and I will ease your grief .—</l>
     <l n="55">The most in years , of all the mourning train ,</l>
     <l n="56">Began ; but swooned first away for pain :</l>
     <l n="57">Then , scarce recovered , spoke ;— Nor envy we</l>
     <l n="58">Thy great renown , nor grudge thy victory :</l>
     <l n="59">‘ Tis thine , O king , the afflicted to redress ,</l>
     <l n="60">And fame has filled the world with thy success :</l>
     <l n="61">We wretched women sue for that alone ,</l>
     <l n="62">Which of thy goodness is refused to none ;</l>
     <l n="63">Let fall some drops of pity on our grief ,</l>
     <l n="64">If what we beg be just , and we deserve relief ;</l>
     <l n="65">For none of us , who now thy grace implore ,</l>
     <l n="66">But held the rank of sovereign queen before ;</l>
     <l n="67">Till , thanks to giddy chance , which never bears ,</l>
     <l n="68">That mortal bliss should last for length of years ,</l>
     <l n="69">She cast us headlong from our high estate ,</l>
     <l n="70">And here in hope of thy return we wait ;</l>
     <l n="71">And long have waited in the temple nigh ,</l>
     <l n="72">Built to the gracious goddess Clemency .</l>
     <l n="73">But reverence thou the power , whose name it bears ;</l>
     <l n="74">Relieve the oppressed , and wipe the widow 's tears .</l>
     <l n="75">I , wretched I , have other fortune seen ,</l>
     <l n="76">The wife of Capaneus , and once a queen :</l>
     <l n="77">At Thebes he fell ; curst be the fatal day !</l>
     <l n="78">And all the rest thou seest in this array ,</l>
     <l n="79">To make their moan , their lords in battle lost</l>
     <l n="80">Before that town besieged by our confederate host ;</l>
     <l n="81">But Creon , old and impious , who commands</l>
     <l n="82">The Theban city , and usurps the lands ,</l>
     <l n="83">Denies the rites of funeral fires to those</l>
     <l n="84">Whose breathless bodies yet he calls his foes .</l>
     <l n="85">Unburned , unburied , on a heap they lie ;</l>
     <l n="86">Such is their fate , and such his tyranny ;</l>
     <l n="87">No friend has leave to bear away the dead ,</l>
     <l n="88">But with their lifeless limbs his hounds are fed .—</l>
     <l n="89">At this she shrieked aloud ; the mournful train</l>
     <l n="90">Echoed her grief , and , grovelling on the plain ,</l>
     <l n="91">With groans , and hands upheld , to move his mind ,</l>
     <l n="92">Besought his pity to their helpless kind .</l>
     <l n="93">The prince was touched , his tears began to flow ,</l>
     <l n="94">And , as his tender heart would break in two ,</l>
     <l n="95">He sighed ; and could not but their fate deplore ,</l>
     <l n="96">So wretched now , so fortunate before .</l>
     <l n="97">Then lightly from his lofty steed he flew ,</l>
     <l n="98">And raising one by one the suppliant crew ,</l>
     <l n="99">To comfort each , full solemnly he swore ,</l>
     <l n="100">“ That , by the faith which knights to knighthood bore ,</l>
     <l n="101">And whate'er else to chivalry belongs ,</l>
     <l n="102">He would not cease , till he revenged their wrongs ;</l>
     <l n="103">That Greece should see performed what he declared ;</l>
     <l n="104">And cruel Creon find his just reward . ” —</l>
     <l n="105">He said no more , but , shunning all delay ,</l>
     <l n="106">Rode on , nor entered Athens on his way ;</l>
     <l n="107">But left his sister and his queen behind ,</l>
     <l n="108">And waved his royal banner in the wind ,</l>
     <l n="109">Where , in an argent field , the god of war</l>
     <l n="110">Was drawn triumphant on his iron car ;</l>
     <l n="111">Red was his sword , and shield , and whole attire ,</l>
     <l n="112">And all the godhead seemed to glow with fire ;</l>
     <l n="113">Even the ground glittered where the standard flew ,</l>
     <l n="114">And the green grass was dyed to sanguine hue .</l>
     <l n="115">High on his pointed lance , his pennon bore<span corresp="#note148" type="note_anchor">[ 148 ]</span></l>
     <l n="116">His Cretan fight , the conquered Minotaur :</l>
     <l n="117">The soldiers shout around with generous rage ,</l>
     <l n="118">And in that victory their own presage .</l>
     <l n="119">He praised their ardour ; inly pleased to see</l>
     <l n="120">His host the flower of Grecian chivalry .</l>
     <l n="121">All day he marched , and all the ensuing night ,</l>
     <l n="122">And saw the city with returning light .</l>
     <l n="123">The process of the war I need not tell ,</l>
     <l n="124">How Theseus conquered , and how Creon fell ;</l>
     <l n="125">Or after , how by storm the walls were won ,</l>
     <l n="126">Or how the victor sacked and burned the town ;</l>
     <l n="127">How to the ladies he restored again</l>
     <l n="128">The bodies of their lords in battle slain ;</l>
     <l n="129">And with what ancient rites they were interred ,—</l>
     <l n="130">All these to fitter times shall be deferred :</l>
     <l n="131">I spare the widows ’ tears , their woful cries ,</l>
     <l n="132">And howling at their husbands ’ obsequies ;</l>
     <l n="133">How Theseus at these funerals did assist ,</l>
     <l n="134">And with what gifts the mourning dames dismissed .</l>
     <l n="135">Thus when the victor-chief had Creon slain ,</l>
     <l n="136">And conquered Thebes , he pitched upon the plain</l>
     <l n="137">His mighty camp , and , when the day returned ,</l>
     <l n="138">The country wasted , and the hamlets burned ,</l>
     <l n="139">And left the pillagers , to rapine bred ,</l>
     <l n="140">Without controul , to strip and spoil the dead .</l>
     <l n="141">There , in a heap of slain , among the rest ,</l>
     <l n="142">Two youthful knights they found beneath a load oppressed</l>
     <l n="143">Of slaughtered foes , whom first to death they sent ,</l>
     <l n="144">The trophies of their strength , a bloody monument .</l>
     <l n="145">Both fair , and both of royal blood they seemed ,</l>
     <l n="146">Whom kinsmen to the crown the heralds deemed ;</l>
     <l n="147">That day in equal arms they fought for fame ;</l>
     <l n="148">Their swords , their shields , their surcoats , were the same .</l>
     <l n="149">Close by each other laid , they pressed the ground ,</l>
     <l n="150">Their manly bosoms pierced with many a grisly wound ;</l>
     <l n="151">Nor well alive , nor wholly dead they were ,</l>
     <l n="152">But some faint signs of feeble life appear ;</l>
     <l n="153">The wandring breath was on the wing to part ,</l>
     <l n="154">Weak was the pulse , and hardly heaved the heart .</l>
     <l n="155">These two were sister 's sons ; and Arcite one ,</l>
     <l n="156">Much famed in fields , with valiant Palamon .</l>
     <l n="157">From these their costly arms the spoilers rent ,</l>
     <l n="158">And softly both conveyed to Theseus ’ tent ;</l>
     <l n="159">Whom , known of Creon 's line , and cured with care ,</l>
     <l n="160">He to his city sent as prisoners of the war ,</l>
     <l n="161">Hopeless of ransom , and condemned to lie</l>
     <l n="162">In durance , doomed a lingering death to die .</l>
     <l n="163">This done , he marched away with warlike sound , }</l>
     <l n="164">And to his Athens turned with laurels crowned , }</l>
     <l n="165">Where happy long he lived , much loved , and more renowned . }</l>
     <l n="166">But in a tower , and never to be loosed ,</l>
     <l n="167">The woful captive kinsmen are inclosed .</l>
     <l n="168">Thus year by year they pass , and day by day ,</l>
     <l n="169">Till once ,— ‘ twas on the morn of cheerful May ,—</l>
     <l n="170">The young Emilia , fairer to be seen</l>
     <l n="171">Than the fair lily on the flowery green ,</l>
     <l n="172">More fresh than May herself in blossoms new ,</l>
     <l n="173">For with the rosy colour strove her hue ,</l>
     <l n="174">Waked , as her custom was , before the day ,</l>
     <l n="175">To do the observance due to sprightly May ;</l>
     <l n="176">For sprightly May commands our youth to keep</l>
     <l n="177">The vigils of her night , and breaks their sluggard sleep ;</l>
     <l n="178">Each gentle breast with kindly warmth she moves ;</l>
     <l n="179">Inspires new flames , revives extinguished loves .</l>
     <l n="180">In this remembrance , Emily , ere day ,</l>
     <l n="181">Arose , and dressed herself in rich array ;</l>
     <l n="182">Fresh as the month , and as the morning fair ,</l>
     <l n="183">Adown her shoulders fell her length of hair ;</l>
     <l n="184">A ribband did the braided tresses bind ,</l>
     <l n="185">The rest was loose , and wantoned in the wind :</l>
     <l n="186">Aurora had but newly chased the night ,</l>
     <l n="187">And purpled o'er the sky with blushing light ,</l>
     <l n="188">When to the garden walk she took her way , }</l>
     <l n="189">To sport and trip along in cool of day , }</l>
     <l n="190">And offer maiden vows in honour of the May . }</l>
     <l n="191">At every turn she made a little stand ,</l>
     <l n="192">And thrust among the thorns her lily hand</l>
     <l n="193">To draw the rose , and every rose she drew ,</l>
     <l n="194">She shook the stalk , and brushed away the dew ;</l>
     <l n="195">Then party-coloured flowers of white and red</l>
     <l n="196">She wove , to make a garland for her head</l>
     <l n="197">This done , she sung and carolled out so clear ,</l>
     <l n="198">That men and angels might rejoice to hear ;</l>
     <l n="199">Even wondering Philomel forgot to sing ,</l>
     <l n="200">And learned from her to welcome in the spring .</l>
     <l n="201">The tower , of which before was mention made ,</l>
     <l n="202">Within whose keep the captive knights were laid ,</l>
     <l n="203">Built of a large extent , and strong withal ,</l>
     <l n="204">Was one partition of the palace wall ;</l>
     <l n="205">The garden was enclosed within the square ,</l>
     <l n="206">Where young Emilia took the morning-air .</l>
     <l n="207">It happened Palamon , the prisoner knight ,</l>
     <l n="208">Restless for woe , arose before the light ,</l>
     <l n="209">And with his jailor 's leave desired to breathe</l>
     <l n="210">An air more wholesome than the damps beneath .</l>
     <l n="211">This granted , to the tower he took his way ,</l>
     <l n="212">Cheered with the promise of a glorious day ;</l>
     <l n="213">Then cast a languishing regard around , }</l>
     <l n="214">And saw , with hateful eyes , the temples crowned }</l>
     <l n="215">With golden spires , and all the hostile ground . }</l>
     <l n="216">He sighed , and turned his eyes , because he knew</l>
     <l n="217">‘ Twas but a larger jail he had in view ;</l>
     <l n="218">Then looked below , and from the castle 's height</l>
     <l n="219">Beheld a nearer and more pleasing sight ;</l>
     <l n="220">The garden , which before he had not seen , }</l>
     <l n="221">In spring 's new livery clad with white and green , }</l>
     <l n="222">Fresh flowers in wide parterres , and shady walks between . }</l>
     <l n="223">This viewed , but not enjoyed , with arms across</l>
     <l n="224">He stood , reflecting on his country 's loss ;</l>
     <l n="225">Himself an object of the public scorn ,</l>
     <l n="226">And often wished he never had been born .</l>
     <l n="227">At last , for so his destiny required ,</l>
     <l n="228">With walking giddy , and with thinking tired ,</l>
     <l n="229">He through a little window cast his sight ,</l>
     <l n="230">Though thick of bars , that gave a scanty light ;</l>
     <l n="231">But even that glimmering served him to descry</l>
     <l n="232">The inevitable charms of Emily .</l>
     <l n="233">Scarce had he seen , but , seized with sudden smart ,</l>
     <l n="234">Stung to the quick , he felt it to his heart ;</l>
     <l n="235">Struck blind with overpowering light , he stood ,</l>
     <l n="236">Then started back amazed , and cried aloud .</l>
     <l n="237">Young Arcite heard , and up he ran with haste ,</l>
     <l n="238">To help his friend , and in his arms embraced ;</l>
     <l n="239">And asked him why he looked so deadly wan ,</l>
     <l n="240">And whence and how his change of cheer began ?</l>
     <l n="241">Or who had done the offence ? “ But if , ” said he ,</l>
     <l n="242">“ Your grief alone is hard captivity ;</l>
     <l n="243">For love of heaven with patience undergo</l>
     <l n="244">A cureless ill , since fate will have it so :</l>
     <l n="245">So stood our horoscope in chains to lie ,</l>
     <l n="246">And Saturn in the dungeon of the sky ,</l>
     <l n="247">Or other baleful aspect , ruled our birth ,</l>
     <l n="248">When all the friendly stars were under earth :</l>
     <l n="249">Whate'er betides , by destiny ‘ tis done ;</l>
     <l n="250">And better bear like men , than vainly seek to shun .</l>
     <l n="251">Nor of my bonds , said Palamon again ,</l>
     <l n="252">Nor of unhappy planets , I complain ;</l>
     <l n="253">But when my mortal anguish caused my cry ,</l>
     <l n="254">That moment I was hurt through either eye ;</l>
     <l n="255">Pierced with a random shaft , I faint away ,</l>
     <l n="256">And perish with insensible decay :</l>
     <l n="257">A glance of some new goddess gave the wound ,</l>
     <l n="258">Whom , like Acteon , unaware I found .</l>
     <l n="259">Look how she walks along yon shady space ! }</l>
     <l n="260">Not Juno moves with more majestic grace , }</l>
     <l n="261">And all the Cyprian queen is in her face . }</l>
     <l n="262">If thou art Venus , ( for thy charms confess ,</l>
     <l n="263">That face was formed in heaven , nor art thou less ;</l>
     <l n="264">Disguised in habit , undisguised in shape ,)</l>
     <l n="265">O help us captives from our chains to ‘ scape !</l>
     <l n="266">But if our doom be past in bonds to lie</l>
     <l n="267">For life , and in a loathsome dungeon die ,</l>
     <l n="268">Then be thy wrath appeased with our disgrace ,</l>
     <l n="269">And shew compassion to the Theban race ,</l>
     <l n="270">Oppressed by tyrant power ! ” — While yet he spoke ,</l>
     <l n="271">Arcite on Emily had fixed his look ;</l>
     <l n="272">The fatal dart a ready passage found ,</l>
     <l n="273">And deep within his heart infixed the wound :</l>
     <l n="274">So that if Palamon were wounded sore ,</l>
     <l n="275">Arcite was hurt as much as he , or more :</l>
     <l n="276">Then from his inmost soul he sighed , and said ,</l>
     <l n="277">The beauty I behold has struck me dead :</l>
     <l n="278">Unknowingly she strikes , and kills by chance ;</l>
     <l n="279">Poison is in her eyes , and death in every glance .</l>
     <l n="280">O , I must ; nor ask alone , but move</l>
     <l n="281">Her mind to mercy , or must die for love .—</l>
     <l n="282">Thus Arcite : And thus Palamon replies ,</l>
     <l n="283">( Eager his tone , and ardent were his eyes ,)</l>
     <l n="284">Speak'st thou in earnest , or in jesting vein ? }</l>
     <l n="285">Jesting , said Arcite , suits but ill with pain . }</l>
     <l n="286">It suits far worse , ( said Palamon again , }</l>
     <l n="287">And bent his brows ,) with men who honour weigh ,</l>
     <l n="288">Their faith to break , their friendship to betray ;</l>
     <l n="289">But worst with thee , of noble lineage born ,</l>
     <l n="290">My kinsman , and in arms my brother sworn .</l>
     <l n="291">Have we not plighted each our holy oath ,</l>
     <l n="292">That one should be the common good of both ;</l>
     <l n="293">One soul should both inspire , and neither prove</l>
     <l n="294">His fellow 's hindrance in pursuit of love ?</l>
     <l n="295">To this before the gods we gave our hands ,</l>
     <l n="296">And nothing but our death can break the bands .</l>
     <l n="297">This binds thee , then , to further my design ,</l>
     <l n="298">As I am bound by vow to further thine :</l>
     <l n="299">Nor canst , nor dar'st thou , traitor , on the plain ,</l>
     <l n="300">Appeach my honour , or thy own maintain ;</l>
     <l n="301">Since thou art of my council , and the friend</l>
     <l n="302">Whose faith I trust , and on whose care depend .</l>
     <l n="303">And wouldst thou court my lady 's love , which I</l>
     <l n="304">Much rather than release would choose to die ?</l>
     <l n="305">But thou , false Arcite , never shalt obtain</l>
     <l n="306">Thy bad pretence ; I told thee first my pain :</l>
     <l n="307">For first my love began ere thine was born ;</l>
     <l n="308">Thou , as my council , and my brother sworn ,</l>
     <l n="309">Art bound to assist my eldership of right ,</l>
     <l n="310">Or justly to be deemed a perjured knight .—</l>
     <l n="311">Thus Palamon : But Arcite , with disdain ,</l>
     <l n="312">In haughty language , thus replied again ,—</l>
     <l n="313">Forsworn thyself : the traitor 's odious name</l>
     <l n="314">I first return , and then disprove thy claim .</l>
     <l n="315">If love be passion , and that passion nurst</l>
     <l n="316">With strong desires , I loved the lady first .</l>
     <l n="317">Canst thou pretend desire , whom zeal inflamed</l>
     <l n="318">To worship , and a power celestial named ?</l>
     <l n="319">Thine was devotion to the blest above ,</l>
     <l n="320">I saw the woman , and desired her love ;</l>
     <l n="321">First owned my passion , and to thee commend</l>
     <l n="322">The important secret , as my chosen friend .</l>
     <l n="323">Suppose ( which yet I grant not ) thy desire</l>
     <l n="324">A moment elder than my rival fire ;</l>
     <l n="325">Can chance of seeing first thy title prove ?</l>
     <l n="326">And know'st thou not , no law is made for love ?</l>
     <l n="327">Law is to things which to free choice relate ;</l>
     <l n="328">Love is not in our choice , but in our fate :</l>
     <l n="329">Laws are but positive ; love 's power , we see ,</l>
     <l n="330">Is nature 's sanction , and her first decree .</l>
     <l n="331">Each day we break the bond of human laws</l>
     <l n="332">For love , and vindicate the common cause .</l>
     <l n="333">Laws for defence of civil rights are placed ;</l>
     <l n="334">Love throws the fences down , and makes a general waste :</l>
     <l n="335">Maids , widows , wives , without distinction fall ;</l>
     <l n="336">The sweeping deluge , love , comes on , and covers all .</l>
     <l n="337">If then the laws of friendship I transgress , }</l>
     <l n="338">I keep the greater , while I break the less ; }</l>
     <l n="339">And both are mad alike , since neither can possess . }</l>
     <l n="340">Both hopeless to be ransomed , never more</l>
     <l n="341">To see the sun , but as he passes o'er .—</l>
     <l n="342">Like Æsop 's hounds contending for the bone ,</l>
     <l n="343">Each pleaded right , and would be lord alone :</l>
     <l n="344">The fruitless fight continued all the day ;</l>
     <l n="345">A cur came by , and snatched the prize away .</l>
     <l n="346">As courtiers therefore jostle for a grant ,</l>
     <l n="347">And when they break their friendship , plead their want ;</l>
     <l n="348">So thou , if fortune will thy suit advance ,</l>
     <l n="349">Love on , nor envy me my equal chance :</l>
     <l n="350">For I must love , and am resolved to try</l>
     <l n="351">My fate , or , failing in the adventure , die .</l>
     <l n="352">Great was their strife , which hourly was renewed ,</l>
     <l n="353">Till each with mortal hate his rival viewed :</l>
     <l n="354">Now friends no more , nor walking hand in hand ,</l>
     <l n="355">But when they met , they made a surly stand ,</l>
     <l n="356">And glared like angry lions as they passed ,</l>
     <l n="357">And wished that every look might be their last .</l>
     <l n="358">It chanced at length , Perithous came , to attend</l>
     <l n="359">This worthy Theseus , his familiar friend :</l>
     <l n="360">Their love in early infancy began ,</l>
     <l n="361">And rose as childhood ripened into man ,</l>
     <l n="362">Companions of the war ; and loved so well , }</l>
     <l n="363">That when one died , as ancient stories tell , }</l>
     <l n="364">His fellow to redeem him went to hell . }</l>
     <l n="365">But to pursue my tale ; to welcome home</l>
     <l n="366">His warlike brother , is Perithous come :</l>
     <l n="367">Arcite of Thebes was known in arms long since ,</l>
     <l n="368">And honoured by this young Thessalian prince .</l>
     <l n="369">Theseus , to gratify his friend and guest ,</l>
     <l n="370">Who made our Arcite 's freedom his request ,</l>
     <l n="371">Restored to liberty the captive knight ,</l>
     <l n="372">But on these hard conditions I recite :—</l>
     <l n="373">That if hereafter Arcite should be found</l>
     <l n="374">Within the compass of Athenian ground ,</l>
     <l n="375">By day or night , or on whate'er pretence ,</l>
     <l n="376">His head should pay the forfeit of the offence .</l>
     <l n="377">To this Perithous for his friend agreed ,</l>
     <l n="378">And on his promise was the prisoner freed .</l>
     <l n="379">Unpleased and pensive hence he takes his way ,</l>
     <l n="380">At his own peril ; for his life must pay .</l>
     <l n="381">Who now but Arcite mourns his bitter fate ,</l>
     <l n="382">Finds his dear purchase , and repents too late ?</l>
     <l n="383">What have I gained , he said , in prison pent ,</l>
     <l n="384">If I but change my bonds for banishment ?</l>
     <l n="385">And banished from her sight , I suffer more</l>
     <l n="386">In freedom , than I felt in bonds before ;</l>
     <l n="387">Forced from her presence , and condemned to live ,</l>
     <l n="388">Unwelcome freedom , and unthanked reprieve :</l>
     <l n="389">Heaven is not , but where Emily abides ,</l>
     <l n="390">And where she 's absent , all is hell besides .</l>
     <l n="391">Next to my day of birth , was that accurst ,</l>
     <l n="392">Which bound my friendship to Perithous first :</l>
     <l n="393">Had I not known that prince , I still had been</l>
     <l n="394">In bondage , and had still Emilia seen :</l>
     <l n="395">For though I never can her grace deserve ,</l>
     <l n="396">‘ Tis recompence enough to see and serve .</l>
     <l n="397">O Palamon , my kinsman and my friend ,</l>
     <l n="398">How much more happy fates thy love attend !</l>
     <l n="399">Thine is the adventure ; thine the victory ;</l>
     <l n="400">Well has thy fortune turned the dice for thee :</l>
     <l n="401">Thou on that angel 's face may'st feed thine eyes ,</l>
     <l n="402">In prison , no ; but blissful paradise !</l>
     <l n="403">Thou daily seest that sun of beauty shine ,</l>
     <l n="404">And lov'st at least in love 's extremest line .</l>
     <l n="405">I mourn in absence , love 's eternal night ; }</l>
     <l n="406">And who can tell but since thou hast her sight , }</l>
     <l n="407">And art a comely , young , and valiant knight , }</l>
     <l n="408">Fortune ( a various power ) may cease to frown ,</l>
     <l n="409">And , by some ways unknown , thy wishes crown ?</l>
     <l n="410">But I , the most forlorn of human kind ,</l>
     <l n="411">Nor help can hope , nor remedy can find ;</l>
     <l n="412">But doomed to drag my loathsome life in care ,</l>
     <l n="413">For my reward , must end it in despair .</l>
     <l n="414">Fire , water , air , and earth , and force of fates ,</l>
     <l n="415">That governs all , and heaven that all creates ,</l>
     <l n="416">Nor art , nor nature 's hand can ease my grief ;</l>
     <l n="417">Nothing but death , the wretch 's last relief :</l>
     <l n="418">Then farewell youth , and all the joys that dwell</l>
     <l n="419">With youth and life , and life itself , farewell !</l>
     <l n="420">But why , alas ! do mortal men in vain</l>
     <l n="421">Of fortune , fate , or Providence , complain ?</l>
     <l n="422">God gives us what he knows our wants require ,</l>
     <l n="423">And better things than those which we desire :</l>
     <l n="424">Some pray for riches ; riches they obtain ;</l>
     <l n="425">But , watched by robbers , for their wealth are slain :</l>
     <l n="426">Some pray from prison to be freed ; and come ,</l>
     <l n="427">When guilty of their vows , to fall at home ;</l>
     <l n="428">Murdered by those they trusted with their life ,</l>
     <l n="429">A favoured servant , or a bosom wife .</l>
     <l n="430">Such dear-bought blessings happen every day ,</l>
     <l n="431">Because we know not for what things to pray .</l>
     <l n="432">Like drunken sots about the streets we roam ;</l>
     <l n="433">Well knows the sot he has a certain home ,</l>
     <l n="434">Yet knows not how to find the uncertain place ,</l>
     <l n="435">And blunders on , and staggers every pace .</l>
     <l n="436">Thus all seek happiness ; but few can find ,</l>
     <l n="437">For far the greater part of men are blind .</l>
     <l n="438">This is my case , who thought our utmost good</l>
     <l n="439">Was in one word of freedom understood :</l>
     <l n="440">The fatal blessing came ; from prison free ,</l>
     <l n="441">I starve abroad , and lose the sight of Emily .—</l>
     <l n="442">Thus Arcite ; but if Arcite thus deplore</l>
     <l n="443">His sufferings , Palamon yet suffers more .</l>
     <l n="444">For when he knew his rival freed and gone ,</l>
     <l n="445">He swells with wrath , he makes outrageous moan ,</l>
     <l n="446">He frets , he fumes , he stares , he stamps the ground ;</l>
     <l n="447">The hollow tower with clamours rings around :</l>
     <l n="448">With briny tears he bathed his fettered feet ,</l>
     <l n="449">And dropped all o'er with agony of sweat .</l>
     <l n="450">Alas ! he cried , I , wretch ! in prison pine ,</l>
     <l n="451">Too happy rival , while the fruit is thine :</l>
     <l n="452">Thou liv'st at large , thou draw'st thy native air ,</l>
     <l n="453">Pleased with thy freedom , proud of my despair :</l>
     <l n="454">Thou may'st , since thou hast youth and courage joined ,</l>
     <l n="455">A sweet behaviour and a solid mind ,</l>
     <l n="456">Assemble ours , and all the Theban race ,</l>
     <l n="457">To vindicate on Athens thy disgrace ;</l>
     <l n="458">And after , by some treaty made , possess</l>
     <l n="459">Fair Emily , the pledge of lasting peace .</l>
     <l n="460">So thine shall be the beauteous prize , while I</l>
     <l n="461">Must languish in despair , in prison die .</l>
     <l n="462">Thus all the advantage of the strife is thine ,</l>
     <l n="463">Thy portion double joys , and double sorrows mine .—</l>
     <l n="464">The rage of jealousy then fired his soul ,</l>
     <l n="465">And his face kindled like a burning coal :</l>
     <l n="466">Now cold despair , succeeding in her stead ,</l>
     <l n="467">To livid paleness turns the glowing red .</l>
     <l n="468">His blood , scarce liquid , creeps within his veins ,</l>
     <l n="469">Like water which the freezing wind constrains .</l>
     <l n="470">Then thus he said :— Eternal deities ,</l>
     <l n="471">Who rule the world with absolute decrees ,</l>
     <l n="472">And write whatever time shall bring to pass ,</l>
     <l n="473">With pens of adamant , on plates of brass ;</l>
     <l n="474">What , is the race of human kind your care</l>
     <l n="475">Beyond what all his fellow-creatures are ?</l>
     <l n="476">He with the rest is liable to pain ,</l>
     <l n="477">And like the sheep , his brother-beast , is slain .</l>
     <l n="478">Cold , hunger , prisons , ills without a cure ,</l>
     <l n="479">All these he must , and , guiltless , oft endure ;</l>
     <l n="480">Or does your justice , power , or presence fail ,</l>
     <l n="481">When the good suffer , and the bad prevail ?</l>
     <l n="482">What worse to wretched virtue could befal ,</l>
     <l n="483">If fate or giddy fortune governed all ?</l>
     <l n="484">Nay , worse than other beasts is our estate ;</l>
     <l n="485">Them , to pursue their pleasures , you create ;</l>
     <l n="486">We , bound by harder laws , must curb our will ,</l>
     <l n="487">And your commands , not our desires , fulfil :</l>
     <l n="488">Then when the creature is unjustly slain ,</l>
     <l n="489">Yet , after death at least , he feels no pain ;</l>
     <l n="490">But man , in life surcharged with woe before ,</l>
     <l n="491">Not freed when dead , is doomed to suffer more .</l>
     <l n="492">A serpent shoots his sting at unaware ;</l>
     <l n="493">An ambushed thief forelays a traveller ;</l>
     <l n="494">The man lies murdered , while the thief and snake ,</l>
     <l n="495">One gains the thickets , and one thrids the brake .</l>
     <l n="496">This let divines decide ; but well I know ,</l>
     <l n="497">Just , or unjust , I have my share of woe :</l>
     <l n="498">Through Saturn seated in a luckless place ,</l>
     <l n="499">And Juno 's wrath , that persecutes my race ;</l>
     <l n="500">Or Mars and Venus , in a quartil , move</l>
     <l n="501">My pangs of jealousy for Arcite 's love .—</l>
     <l n="502">Let Palamon oppressed in bondage mourn ,</l>
     <l n="503">While to his exiled rival we return .</l>
     <l n="504">By this , the sun , declining from his height ,</l>
     <l n="505">The day had shortened to prolong the night :</l>
     <l n="506">The lengthened night gave length of misery ,</l>
     <l n="507">Both to the captive lover and the free .</l>
     <l n="508">For Palamon in endless prison mourns ,</l>
     <l n="509">And Arcite forfeits life if he returns .</l>
     <l n="510">The banished never hopes his love to see ,</l>
     <l n="511">Nor hopes the captive lord his liberty :</l>
     <l n="512">‘ Tis hard to say who suffers greater pains ;</l>
     <l n="513">One sees his love , but cannot break his chains ;</l>
     <l n="514">One free , and all his motions uncontrouled ,</l>

     <l n="517">What fortune to the banished knight befel .</l>
     <l n="518">When Arcite was to Thebes returned again ,</l>
     <l n="519">The loss of her he loved renewed his pain ;</l>
     <l n="520">What could be worse , than never more to see</l>
     <l n="521">His life , his soul , his charming Emily ?</l>
     <l n="522">He raved with all the madness of despair ,</l>
     <l n="523">He roared , he beat his breast , he tore his hair .</l>
     <l n="524">Dry sorrow in his stupid eyes appears ,</l>
     <l n="525">For , wanting nourishment , he wanted tears :</l>
     <l n="526">His eye-balls in their hollow sockets sink ,</l>
     <l n="527">Bereft of sleep ; he loaths his meat and drink .</l>
     <l n="528">He withers at his heart , and looks as wan</l>
     <l n="529">As the pale spectre of a murdered man :</l>
     <l n="530">That pale turns yellow , and his face receives</l>
     <l n="531">The faded hue of sapless boxen leaves :</l>
     <l n="532">In solitary groves he makes his moan ,</l>
     <l n="533">Walks early out , and ever is alone :</l>
     <l n="534">Nor , mixed in mirth , in youthful pleasures shares ,</l>
     <l n="535">But sighs when songs and instruments he hears .</l>
     <l n="536">His spirits are so low , his voice is drowned ; }</l>
     <l n="537">He hears as from afar , or in a swoon , }</l>
     <l n="538">Like the deaf murmurs of a distant sound : }</l>
     <l n="539">Uncombed his locks , and squalid his attire ,</l>
     <l n="540">Unlike the trim of love and gay desire ;</l>
     <l n="541">But full of museful mopings , which presage</l>
     <l n="542">The loss of reason , and conclude in rage .</l>
     <l n="543">This when he had endured a year and more ,</l>
     <l n="544">Now wholly changed from what he was before ,</l>
     <l n="545">It happened once , that , slumbering as he lay ,</l>
     <l n="546">He dreamed , ( his dream began at break of day ,)</l>
     <l n="547">That Hermes o'er his head in air appeared ,</l>
     <l n="548">And with soft words his drooping spirits cheered :</l>
     <l n="549">His hat , adorned with wings , disclosed the God ,</l>
     <l n="550">And in his hand he bore the sleep-compelling rod ;</l>
     <l n="551">Such as he seemed , when , at his sire 's command ,</l>
     <l n="552">On Argus ’ head he laid the snaky wand .</l>
     <l n="553">Arise , he said , to conquering Athens go ,</l>
     <l n="554">There fate appoints an end of all thy woe .—<span corresp="#note150" type="note_anchor">[ 150 ]</span></l>
     <l n="555">The fright awakened Arcite with a start ,</l>
     <l n="556">Against his bosom bounced his heaving heart ;</l>
     <l n="557">But soon he said , with scarce-recovered breath ,</l>
     <l n="558">And thither will I go , to meet my death ,</l>
     <l n="559">Sure to be slain ; but death is my desire ,</l>
     <l n="560">Since in Emilia 's sight I shall expire .—</l>
     <l n="561">By chance he spied a mirror while he spoke ,</l>
     <l n="562">And gazing there beheld his altered look ;</l>
     <l n="563">Wondering , he saw his features and his hue</l>
     <l n="564">So much were changed , that scarce himself he knew .</l>
     <l n="565">A sudden thought then starting in his mind ,—</l>
     <l n="566">Since I in Arcite cannot Arcite find ,</l>
     <l n="567">The world may search in vain with all their eyes ,</l>
     <l n="568">But never penetrate through this disguise .</l>
     <l n="569">Thanks to the change which grief and sickness give ,</l>
     <l n="570">In low estate I may securely live ,</l>
     <l n="571">And see , unknown , my mistress day by day .—</l>
     <l n="572">He said , and clothed himself in coarse array ;</l>
     <l n="573">A labouring hind in shew : then forth he went ,</l>
     <l n="574">And to the Athenian towers his journey bent :</l>
     <l n="575">One squire attended in the same disguise ,</l>
     <l n="576">Made conscious of his master 's enterprize .</l>
     <l n="577">Arrived at Athens , soon he came to court ,</l>
     <l n="578">Unknown , unquestioned in that thick resort ;</l>
     <l n="579">Proffering for hire his service at the gate ,</l>
     <l n="580">To drudge , draw water , and to run or wait .</l>
     <l n="581">So fair befel him , that for little gain</l>
     <l n="582">He served at first Emilia 's chamberlain ;</l>
     <l n="583">And , watchful all advantages to spy ,</l>
     <l n="584">Was still at hand , and in his master 's eye ;</l>
     <l n="585">And , as his bones were big , and sinews strong ,</l>
     <l n="586">Refused no toil that could to slaves belong ;</l>
     <l n="587">But from deep wells with engines water drew ,</l>
     <l n="588">And used his noble hands the wood to hew .</l>
     <l n="589">He passed a year at least attending thus</l>
     <l n="590">On Emily , and called Philostratus .</l>
     <l n="591">But never was there man of his degree</l>
     <l n="592">So much esteemed , so well beloved as he .</l>
     <l n="593">So gentle of condition was he known ,</l>
     <l n="594">That through the court his courtesy was blown :</l>
     <l n="595">All think him worthy of a greater place ,</l>
     <l n="596">And recommend him to the royal grace ;</l>
     <l n="597">That , exercised within a higher sphere ,</l>
     <l n="598">His virtues more conspicuous might appear .</l>
     <l n="599">Thus by the general voice was Arcite praised ,</l>
     <l n="600">And by great Theseus to high favour raised ;</l>
     <l n="601">Among his menial servants first enrolled ,</l>
     <l n="602">And largely entertained with sums of gold ;</l>
     <l n="603">Besides what secretly from Thebes was sent ,</l>
     <l n="604">Of his own income , and his annual rent .</l>
     <l n="605">This well employed , he purchased friends and fame ,</l>
     <l n="606">But cautiously concealed from whence it came .</l>
     <l n="607">Thus for three years he lived with large increase ,</l>
     <l n="608">In arms of honour , and esteem in peace ;</l>
     <l n="609">To Theseus ’ person he was ever near ,</l>
     <l n="610">And Theseus for his virtues held him dear .</l>

    <head>PALAMON AND ARCITE ,</head>
    <head>OR ,</head>
    <head>THE KNIGHT 'S TALE .</head>
    <head>BOOK II .</head>
     <l n="1">While Arcite lives in bliss , the story turns</l>
     <l n="2">Where hopeless Palamon in prison mourns .</l>
     <l n="3">For six long years immured , the captive knight</l>
     <l n="4">Had dragged his chains , and scarcely seen the light :</l>
     <l n="5">Lost liberty and love at once he bore ;</l>
     <l n="6">His prison pained him much , his passion more ;</l>
     <l n="7">Nor dares he hope his fetters to remove ,</l>
     <l n="8">Nor ever wishes to be free from love .</l>
     <l n="9">But when the sixth revolving year was run ,</l>
     <l n="10">And May , within the Twins , received the sun ,</l>
     <l n="11">Were it by chance , or forceful destiny ,</l>
     <l n="12">Which forms in causes first whate'er shall be ,</l>
     <l n="13">Assisted by a friend , one moonless night ,</l>
     <l n="14">This Palamon from prison took his flight .</l>
     <l n="15">A pleasant beverage he prepared before</l>
     <l n="16">Of wine and honey , mixed with added store</l>
     <l n="17">Of opium ; to his keeper this he brought ,</l>
     <l n="18">Who swallowed , unaware , the sleepy draught ,</l>
     <l n="19">And snored secure till morn , his senses bound</l>
     <l n="20">In slumber , and in long oblivion drowned .</l>
     <l n="21">Short was the night , and careful Palamon</l>
     <l n="22">Sought the next covert ere the rising sun .</l>
     <l n="23">A thick-spread forest near the city lay , }</l>
     <l n="24">To this , with lengthened strides , he took his way , }</l>
     <l n="25">( For far he could not fly , and feared the day . ) }</l>
     <l n="26">Safe from pursuit , he meant to shun the light , }</l>
     <l n="27">Till the brown shadows of the friendly night }</l>
     <l n="28">To Thebes might favour his intended flight . }</l>
     <l n="29">When to his country come , his next design</l>
     <l n="30">Was all the Theban race in arms to join ,</l>
     <l n="31">And war on Theseus , till he lost his life ,</l>
     <l n="32">Or won the beauteous Emily to wife .</l>
     <l n="33">Thus while his thoughts the lingering day beguile ,</l>
     <l n="34">To gentle Arcite let us turn our style ;</l>
     <l n="35">Who little dreamt how nigh he was to care ,</l>
     <l n="36">Till treacherous fortune caught him in the snare .</l>
     <l n="37">The morning lark , the messenger of day ,</l>
     <l n="38">Saluted , in her song , the morning gray ;</l>
     <l n="39">And soon the sun arose with beams so bright ,</l>
     <l n="40">That all the horizon laughed to see the joyous sight .</l>
     <l n="41">He , with his tepid rays , the rose renews ,</l>
     <l n="42">And licks the drooping leaves , and dries the dews ;</l>
     <l n="43">When Arcite left his bed , resolved to pay</l>
     <l n="44">Observance to the month of merry May :</l>
     <l n="45">Forth , on his fiery steed , betimes he rode ,</l>
     <l n="46">That scarcely prints the turf on which he trode :</l>
     <l n="47">At ease he seemed , and , prancing o'er the plains ,</l>
     <l n="48">Turned only to the grove his horse 's reins ,</l>
     <l n="49">( The grove I named before ,) and lighting there ,</l>
     <l n="50">A woodbine garland sought to crown his hair ;</l>
     <l n="51">Then turned his face against the rising day ,</l>
     <l n="52">And raised his voice to welcome in the May :—</l>
     <l n="53">For thee , sweet month , the groves green liveries wear ,</l>
     <l n="54">If not the first , the fairest , of the year :</l>
     <l n="55">For thee the Graces lead the dancing hours ,</l>
     <l n="56">And Nature 's ready pencil paints the flowers :</l>
     <l n="57">When thy short reign is past , the feverish sun</l>
     <l n="58">The sultry tropic fears , and moves more slowly on .</l>
     <l n="59">So may thy tender blossoms fear no blight ,</l>
     <l n="60">Nor goats , with venomed teeth , thy tendrils bite ,</l>
     <l n="61">As thou shalt guide my wandering feet to find</l>
     <l n="62">The fragrant greens I seek , my brows to bind .—</l>
     <l n="63">His vows addressed , within the grove he strayed , }</l>
     <l n="64">Till Fate , or Fortune , near the place conveyed }</l>
     <l n="65">His steps where secret Palamon was laid . }</l>
     <l n="66">Full little thought of him the gentle knight , }</l>
     <l n="67">Who , flying death , had there concealed his flight , }</l>
     <l n="68">In brakes and brambles hid , and shunning mortal sight ; }</l>
     <l n="69">And less he knew him for his hated foe ,</l>
     <l n="70">But feared him as a man he did not know .</l>
     <l n="71">But as it has been said of ancient years ,</l>
     <l n="72">That fields are full of eyes , and woods have ears ,</l>
     <l n="73">For this the wise are ever on their guard ,</l>
     <l n="74">For , unforeseen , they say , is unprepared .</l>
     <l n="75">Uncautious Arcite thought himself alone ,</l>
     <l n="76">And less than all suspected Palamon ,</l>
     <l n="77">Who , listening , heard him , while he searched the grove ,</l>
     <l n="78">And loudly sung his roundelay of love .</l>
     <l n="79">But on the sudden stopped , and silent stood ,</l>
     <l n="80">As lovers often muse , and change their mood ;</l>
     <l n="81">Now high as heaven , and then as low as hell ,</l>
     <l n="82">Now up , now down , as buckets in a well :</l>
     <l n="83">For Venus , like her day , will change her cheer ,</l>
     <l n="84">And seldom shall we see a Friday clear .</l>
     <l n="85">Thus Arcite having sung , with altered hue</l>
     <l n="86">Sunk on the ground , and from his bosom drew</l>
     <l n="87">A desperate sigh , accusing Heaven and Fate ,</l>
     <l n="88">And angry Juno 's unrelenting hate :—</l>
     <l n="89">Cursed be the day when first I did appear ! }</l>
     <l n="90">Let it be blotted from the calendar , }</l>
     <l n="91">Lest it pollute the month , and poison all the year . }</l>
     <l n="92">Still will the jealous queen pursue our race ?</l>
     <l n="93">Cadmus is dead , the Theban city was :</l>
     <l n="94">Yet ceases not her hate ; for all , who come</l>
     <l n="95">From Cadmus , are involved in Cadmus ’ doom .</l>
     <l n="96">I suffer for my blood : unjust decree !</l>
     <l n="97">That punishes another 's crime on me .</l>
     <l n="98">In mean estate , I serve my mortal foe ,</l>
     <l n="99">The man who caused my country 's overthrow .</l>
     <l n="100">This is not all ; for Juno , to my shame , }</l>
     <l n="101">Has forced me to forsake my former name ; }</l>
     <l n="102">Arcite I was , Philostratus I am . }</l>
     <l n="103">That side of heaven is all my enemy ;</l>
     <l n="104">Mars ruined Thebes ; his mother<span corresp="#note151" type="note_anchor">[ 151 ]</span>ruined me .</l>
     <l n="105">Of all the royal race remains but one ,</l>
     <l n="106">Besides myself , the unhappy Palamon ,</l>
     <l n="107">Whom Theseus holds in bonds , and will not free ;</l>
     <l n="108">Without a crime , except his kin to me .</l>
     <l n="109">Yet these , and all the rest , I could endure ;</l>
     <l n="110">But love 's a malady without a cure :</l>
     <l n="111">Fierce Love has pierced me with his fiery dart ;</l>
     <l n="112">He fries within , and hisses at my heart .</l>
     <l n="113">Your eyes , fair Emily , my fate pursue ;</l>
     <l n="114">I suffer for the rest , I die for you .</l>
     <l n="115">Of such a goddess no time leaves record ,</l>
     <l n="116">Who burned the temple where she was adored :</l>
     <l n="117">And let it burn , I never will complain ,</l>
     <l n="118">Pleased with my sufferings , if you knew my pain .—</l>
     <l n="119">At this , a sickly qualm his heart assailed ,</l>
     <l n="120">His ears ring inward , and his senses failed .</l>
     <l n="121">No word missed Palamon , of all he spoke ;</l>
     <l n="122">But soon to deadly pale he changed his look :</l>
     <l n="123">He trembled every limb , and felt a smart ,</l>
     <l n="124">As if cold steel had glided through his heart ;</l>
     <l n="125">Nor longer staid , but , starting from his place ,</l>
     <l n="126">Discovered stood , and shewed his hostile face :—</l>
     <l n="127">False traitor , Arcite , traitor to thy blood ,</l>
     <l n="128">Bound by thy sacred oath to seek my good ,</l>
     <l n="129">Now art thou found forsworn , for Emily ,</l>
     <l n="130">And darest attempt her love , for whom I die .</l>
     <l n="131">So hast thou cheated Theseus with a wile ,</l>
     <l n="132">Against thy vow , returning to beguile</l>
     <l n="133">Under a borrowed name : as false to me ,</l>
     <l n="134">So false thou art to him , who set thee free .</l>
     <l n="135">But rest assured , that either thou shalt die ,</l>
     <l n="136">Or else renounce thy claim in Emily ;</l>
     <l n="137">For , though unarmed I am , and ( freed by chance )</l>
     <l n="138">Am here without my sword , or pointed lance ,</l>
     <l n="139">Hope not , base man , unquestioned hence to go ,</l>
     <l n="140">For I am Palamon , thy mortal foe .—</l>
     <l n="141">Arcite , who heard his tale , and knew the man ,</l>
     <l n="142">His sword unsheathed , and fiercely thus began :—</l>
     <l n="143">Now , by the gods , who govern heaven above ,</l>
     <l n="144">Wert thou not weak with hunger , mad with love ,</l>
     <l n="145">That word had been thy last ; or , in this grove ,</l>
     <l n="146">This hand should force thee to renounce thy love !</l>
     <l n="147">The surety , which I gave thee , I defy : }</l>
     <l n="148">Fool , not to know , that love endures no tie , }</l>
     <l n="149">And Jove but laughs at lovers ’ perjury ! }</l>
     <l n="150">Know , I will serve the fair in thy despite ;</l>
     <l n="151">But , since thou art my kinsman , and a knight ,</l>
     <l n="152">Here , have my faith , to-morrow , in this grove ,</l>
     <l n="153">Our arms shall plead the titles of our love :</l>
     <l n="154">And heaven so help my right , as I alone</l>
     <l n="155">Will come , and keep the cause and quarrel both unknown ,</l>
     <l n="156">With arms of proof , both for myself and thee ;</l>
     <l n="157">Choose thou the best , and leave the worst to me .</l>
     <l n="158">And , that at better ease thou may'st abide ,</l>
     <l n="159">Bedding and clothes I will this night provide ,</l>
     <l n="160">And needful sustenance , that thou may'st be</l>
     <l n="161">A conquest better won , and worthy me .—</l>
     <l n="162">His promise Palamon accepts ; but prayed</l>
     <l n="163">To keep it better than the first he made .</l>
     <l n="164">Thus fair they parted till the morrow 's dawn ;</l>
     <l n="165">For each had laid his plighted faith to pawn .</l>
     <l n="166">Oh Love ! thou sternly dost thy power maintain , }</l>
     <l n="167">And wilt not bear a rival in thy reign ; }</l>
     <l n="168">Tyrants and thou all fellowship disdain . }</l>
     <l n="169">This was in Arcite proved and Palamon ,</l>
     <l n="170">Both in despair , yet each would love alone .</l>
     <l n="171">Arcite returned , and , as in honour tied ,</l>
     <l n="172">His foe with bedding , and with food , supplied ;</l>
     <l n="173">Then , ere the day , two suits of armour sought ,</l>
     <l n="174">Which , borne before him , on his steed he brought ;</l>
     <l n="175">Both were of shining steel , and wrought so pure ,</l>
     <l n="176">As might the strokes of two such arms endure .</l>
     <l n="177">Now at the time , and in the appointed place ,</l>
     <l n="178">The challenger and challenged , face to face ,</l>
     <l n="179">Approach ; each other , from afar , they knew ,</l>
     <l n="180">And from afar their hatred changed their hue .</l>
     <l n="181">So stands the Thracian herdsman , with his spear ,</l>
     <l n="182">Full in the gap , and hopes the hunted bear ,</l>
     <l n="183">And hears him rustling in the wood , and sees</l>
     <l n="184">His course , at distance , by the bending trees ;</l>
     <l n="185">And thinks , here comes my mortal enemy ,</l>
     <l n="186">And either he must fall in fight , or I :</l>
     <l n="187">This while he thinks , he lifts aloft his dart ; }</l>
     <l n="188">A generous chillness seizes every part ; }</l>
     <l n="189">The veins pour back the blood , and fortify the heart . }</l>
     <l n="190">Thus pale they meet ; their eyes with fury burn ;</l>
     <l n="191">None greets , for none the greeting will return ;</l>
     <l n="192">But in dumb surliness , each armed , with care ,</l>
     <l n="193">His foe profest , as brother of the war :</l>
     <l n="194">Then both , no moment lost , at once advance</l>
     <l n="195">Against each other , armed with sword and lance .</l>
     <l n="196">They lash , they foin , they pass , they strive to bore</l>
     <l n="197">Their corslets , and the thinnest parts explore .</l>
     <l n="198">Thus two long hours , in equal arms , they stood ,</l>
     <l n="199">And , wounded , wound , till both were bathed in blood ;</l>
     <l n="200">And not a foot of ground had either got ,</l>
     <l n="201">As if the world depended on the spot .</l>
     <l n="202">Fell Arcite like an angry tyger fared ,</l>
     <l n="203">And like a lion Palamon appeared :</l>
     <l n="204">Or , as two boars , whom love to battle draws ,</l>
     <l n="205">With rising bristles , and with frothy jaws ,</l>
     <l n="206">Their adverse breasts with tusks oblique they wound ;</l>
     <l n="207">With grunts and groans the forest rings around .</l>
     <l n="208">So fought the knights , and fighting must abide ,</l>
     <l n="209">Till fate an umpire sends their difference to decide .</l>
     <l n="210">The power that ministers to God 's decrees ,</l>
     <l n="211">And executes on earth what heaven foresees ,</l>
     <l n="212">Called Providence , or Chance , or Fatal Sway ,</l>
     <l n="213">Comes with resistless force , and finds , or makes , her way ;</l>
     <l n="214">Nor kings , nor nations , nor united power ,</l>
     <l n="215">One moment can retard the appointed hour ;</l>
     <l n="216">And some one day , some wondrous chance appears ,</l>
     <l n="217">Which happened not in centuries of years :</l>
     <l n="218">For sure , whate'er we mortals hate , or love ,</l>
     <l n="219">Or hope , or fear , depends on powers above ;</l>
     <l n="220">They move our appetites to good or ill ,</l>
     <l n="221">And , by foresight , necessitate the will .</l>
     <l n="222">In Theseus this appears , whose youthful joy</l>
     <l n="223">Was beasts of chace in forests to destroy ;</l>
     <l n="224">This gentle knight , inspired by jolly May , }</l>
     <l n="225">Forsook his easy couch at early day , }</l>
     <l n="226">And to the wood and wilds pursued his way . }</l>
     <l n="227">Beside him rode Hippolita the queen ,</l>
     <l n="228">And Emily , attired in lively green ,</l>
     <l n="229">With horns , and hounds , and all the tuneful cry ,</l>
     <l n="230">To hunt a royal hart , within the covert nigh :</l>
     <l n="231">And , as he followed Mars before , so now</l>
     <l n="232">He serves the goddess of the silver bow .</l>
     <l n="233">The way , that Theseus took , was to the wood ,</l>
     <l n="234">Where the two knights in cruel battle stood :</l>
     <l n="235">The lawn , in which they fought , the appointed place ,</l>
     <l n="236">In which the uncoupled hounds began the chace .</l>
     <l n="237">Thither , forth-right , he rode to rouze the prey ,</l>
     <l n="238">That , shaded by the fern , in harbour lay ;</l>
     <l n="239">And , thence dislodged , was wont to leave the wood ,</l>
     <l n="240">For open fields , and cross the crystal flood .</l>
     <l n="241">Approached , and looking underneath the sun ,</l>
     <l n="242">He saw proud Arcite , and fierce Palamon ,</l>
     <l n="243">In mortal battle doubling blow on blow ,</l>
     <l n="244">Like lightning flamed their faulchions to and fro ,</l>
     <l n="245">And shot a dreadful gleam ; so strong they struck .</l>
     <l n="246">There seemed less force required to fell an oak .</l>
     <l n="247">He gazed with wonder on their equal might ,</l>
     <l n="248">Looked eager on , but knew not either knight .</l>
     <l n="249">Resolved to learn , he spurred his fiery steed</l>
     <l n="250">With goring rowels to provoke his speed .</l>
     <l n="251">The minute ended that began the race ,</l>
     <l n="252">So soon he was betwixt them on the place ;</l>
     <l n="253">And , with his sword unsheathed , on pain of life ,</l>
     <l n="254">Commands both combatants to cease their strife :</l>
     <l n="255">Then , with imperious tone pursues his threat :—</l>
     <l n="256">What are you ? Why in arms together met ?</l>
     <l n="257">How dares your pride presume against my laws ,</l>
     <l n="258">As in a listed field to fight your cause ,</l>
     <l n="259">Unasked the royal grant ; no marshal by ,</l>
     <l n="260">As knightly rites require ; nor judge to try ?—</l>
     <l n="261">Then Palamon , with scarce recovered breath ,</l>
     <l n="262">Thus hasty spoke :— We both deserve the death ,</l>
     <l n="263">And both would die ; for , look the world around ,</l>
     <l n="264">A pair so wretched is not to be found .</l>
     <l n="265">Our life 's a load ; encumbered with the charge ,</l>
     <l n="266">We long to set the imprisoned soul at large .</l>
     <l n="267">Now , as thou art a sovereign judge , decree }</l>
     <l n="268">The rightful doom of death to him and me ; }</l>
     <l n="269">Let neither find thy grace , for grace is cruelty . }</l>
     <l n="270">Me first , O kill me first , and cure my woe ,</l>
     <l n="271">Then sheath the sword of justice on my foe :</l>
     <l n="272">Or kill him first ; for when his name is heard ,</l>
     <l n="273">He foremost will receive his due reward .</l>
     <l n="274">Arcite of Thebes is he , thy mortal foe ,</l>
     <l n="275">On whom thy grace did liberty bestow ;</l>
     <l n="276">But first contracted , that , if ever found ,</l>
     <l n="277">By day or night , upon the Athenian ground ,</l>
     <l n="278">His head should pay the forfeit ; see returned</l>
     <l n="279">The perjured knight , his oath and honour scorned :</l>
     <l n="280">For this is he , who , with a borrowed name</l>
     <l n="281">And proffer 'd service , to thy palace came ,</l>
     <l n="282">Now called Philostratus ; retained by thee , }</l>
     <l n="283">A traitor trusted , and in high degree , }</l>
     <l n="284">Aspiring to the bed of beauteous Emily . }</l>
     <l n="285">My part remains ;— from Thebes my birth I own ,</l>
     <l n="286">And call myself the unhappy Palamon .</l>
     <l n="287">Think me not like that man , since no disgrace</l>
     <l n="288">Can force me to renounce the honour of my race .</l>
     <l n="289">Know me for what I am : I broke thy chain ,</l>
     <l n="290">Nor promised I thy prisoner to remain :</l>
     <l n="291">The love of liberty with life is given ,</l>
     <l n="292">And life itself the inferior gift of heaven .</l>
     <l n="293">Thus without crime I fled ; but farther know ,</l>
     <l n="294">I , with this Arcite , am thy mortal foe :</l>
     <l n="295">Then , give me death , since I thy life pursue ;</l>
     <l n="296">For safeguard of thyself , death is my due .</l>
     <l n="297">More wouldst thou know , I love bright Emily ,</l>
     <l n="298">And for her sake , and in her sight , will die :</l>
     <l n="299">But kill my rival too ; for he no less }</l>
     <l n="300">Deserves , and I thy righteous doom will bless , }</l>
     <l n="301">Assured , that what I lose , he never shall possess .— }</l>
     <l n="302">To this replied the stern Athenian prince ,</l>
     <l n="303">And sourly smiled :— In owning your offence</l>
     <l n="304">You judge yourself , and I but keep record</l>
     <l n="305">In place of law , while you pronounce the word .</l>
     <l n="306">Take your desert , the death you have decreed ;</l>
     <l n="307">I seal your doom , and ratify the deed :</l>
     <l n="308">By Mars , the patron of my arms , you die .—</l>
     <l n="309">He said ; dumb sorrow seized the standers by .</l>
     <l n="310">The queen , above the rest , by nature good ,</l>
     <l n="311">( The pattern formed of perfect womanhood ,)</l>
     <l n="312">For tender pity wept : when she began ,</l>
     <l n="313">Through the bright choir the infectious virtue ran .</l>
     <l n="314">All dropped their tears , even the contended maid ,</l>
     <l n="315">And thus , among themselves , they softly said :—</l>
     <l n="316">What eyes can suffer this unworthy sight !</l>
     <l n="317">Two youths of royal blood , renowned in fight ,</l>
     <l n="318">The mastership of heaven in face and mind ,</l>
     <l n="319">And lovers , far beyond their faithless kind :</l>
     <l n="320">See their wide-streaming wounds ; they neither came</l>
     <l n="321">For pride of empire , nor desire of fame :</l>
     <l n="322">Kings fight for kingdoms , madmen for applause ;</l>
     <l n="323">But love for love alone , that crowns the lover 's cause .—</l>
     <l n="324">This thought , which ever bribes the beauteous kind ,</l>
     <l n="325">Such pity wrought in every lady 's mind ,</l>
     <l n="326">They left their steeds , and , prostrate on the place ,</l>
     <l n="327">From the fierce king implored the offenders ’ grace .</l>
     <l n="328">He paused a while , stood silent in his mood ;</l>
     <l n="329">For yet his rage was boiling in his blood :</l>
     <l n="330">But soon his tender mind the impression felt ,</l>
     <l n="331">As softest metals are not slow to melt ,</l>
     <l n="332">And pity soonest runs in gentle minds :[ 152 ]</l>
     <l n="333">Then reasons with himself ; and first he finds</l>
     <l n="334">His passion cast a mist before his sense ,</l>
     <l n="335">And either made , or magnified , the offence .</l>
     <l n="336">Offence ! of what ? to whom ? who judged the cause ?</l>
     <l n="337">The prisoner freed himself by Nature 's laws :</l>
     <l n="338">Born free , he sought his right ; the man he freed</l>
     <l n="339">Was perjured , but his love excused the deed :</l>
     <l n="340">Thus pondering , he looked under with his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="341">And saw the women 's tears , and heard their cries ;</l>
     <l n="342">Which moved compassion more : he shook his head ,</l>
     <l n="343">And softly , sighing , to himself he said :—</l>
     <l n="344">Curse on the unpardoning prince , whom tears can draw</l>
     <l n="345">To no remorse ; who rules by lions ’ law ;</l>
     <l n="346">And , deaf to prayers , by no submission bowed ,</l>
     <l n="347">Rends all alike , the penitent and proud !—</l>
     <l n="348">At this , with look serene , he raised his head ;</l>
     <l n="349">Reason resumed her place , and passion fled .</l>
     <l n="350">Then thus aloud he spoke :— The power of Love ,</l>
     <l n="351">In earth , and seas , and air , and heaven above ,</l>
     <l n="352">Rules , unresisted , with an awful nod ;</l>
     <l n="353">By daily miracles declared a god :</l>
     <l n="354">He blinds the wise , gives eye-sight to the blind ,</l>
     <l n="355">And moulds and stamps anew the lover 's mind .</l>
     <l n="356">Behold that Arcite , and this Palamon ,</l>
     <l n="357">Freed from my fetters , and in safety gone ,</l>
     <l n="358">What hindered either , in their native soil ,</l>
     <l n="359">At ease to reap the harvest of their toil ?</l>
     <l n="360">But Love , their lord , did otherwise ordain ,</l>
     <l n="361">And brought them in their own despite again ,</l>
     <l n="362">To suffer death deserved ; for well they know ,</l>
     <l n="363">‘ Tis in my power , and I their deadly foe .</l>
     <l n="364">The proverb holds ,— that to be wise , and love ,</l>
     <l n="365">Is hardly granted to the gods above .</l>
     <l n="366">See how the madmen bleed ! behold the gains</l>
     <l n="367">With which their master , Love , rewards their pains !</l>
     <l n="368">For seven long years , on duty every day ,</l>
     <l n="369">Lo their obedience , and their monarch 's pay :</l>
     <l n="370">Yet , as in duty bound , they serve him on ;</l>
     <l n="371">And , ask the fools , they think it wisely done ;</l>
     <l n="372">Nor ease , nor wealth , nor life itself , regard ;</l>
     <l n="373">For ‘ tis their maxim ,— Love is love 's reward .</l>
     <l n="374">This is not all ,— the fair , for whom they strove ,</l>
     <l n="375">Nor knew before , nor could suspect their love ,</l>
     <l n="376">Nor thought , when she beheld the fight from far ,</l>
     <l n="377">Her beauty was the occasion of the war .</l>
     <l n="378">But sure a general doom on man is past ,</l>
     <l n="379">And all are fools and lovers , first or last :</l>
     <l n="380">This , both by others and myself , I know ,</l>
     <l n="381">For I have served their sovereign long ago ;</l>
     <l n="382">Oft have been caught within the winding train }</l>
     <l n="383">Of female snares , and felt the lover 's pain , }</l>
     <l n="384">And learned how far the god can human hearts constrain . }</l>
     <l n="385">To this remembrance , and the prayers of those ,</l>
     <l n="386">Who for the offending warriors interpose ,</l>
     <l n="387">I give their forfeit lives , on this accord ,</l>
     <l n="388">To do me homage , as their sovereign lord ;</l>
     <l n="389">And , as my vassals , to their utmost might ,</l>
     <l n="390">Assist my person , and assert my right .—</l>
     <l n="391">This freely sworn , the knights their grace obtained ;</l>
     <l n="392">Then thus the king his secret thoughts explained :—</l>
     <l n="393">If wealth , or honour , or a royal race ,</l>
     <l n="394">Or each , or all , may win a lady 's grace ,</l>
     <l n="395">Then either of you , knights , may well deserve</l>
     <l n="396">A princess born ; and such is she you serve :</l>
     <l n="397">For Emily is sister to the crown ,</l>
     <l n="398">And but too well to both her beauty known .</l>
     <l n="399">But should you combat till you both were dead ,</l>
     <l n="400">Two lovers cannot share a single bed .</l>
     <l n="401">As therefore both are equal in degree ,</l>
     <l n="402">The lot of both be left to Destiny .</l>
     <l n="403">Now hear the award , and happy may it prove</l>
     <l n="404">To her , and him who best deserves her love .</l>
     <l n="405">Depart from hence in peace , and free as air ,</l>
     <l n="406">Search the wide world , and where you please repair ;</l>
     <l n="407">But on the day when this returning sun</l>
     <l n="408">To the same point through every sign has run ,</l>
     <l n="409">Then each of you his hundred knights shall bring ,</l>
     <l n="410">In royal lists , to fight before the king ;</l>
     <l n="411">And then the knight , whom Fate , or happy Chance ,</l>
     <l n="412">Shall with his friends to victory advance ,</l>
     <l n="413">And grace his arms so far in equal fight ,</l>
     <l n="414">From out the bars<span corresp="#note153" type="note_anchor">[ 153 ]</span>to force his opposite ,</l>
     <l n="415">Or kill , or make him recreant on the plain ,</l>
     <l n="416">The prize of valour and of love shall gain ;</l>
     <l n="417">The vanquished party shall their claim release ,</l>
     <l n="418">And the long jars conclude in lasting peace .</l>
     <l n="419">The charge be mine to adorn the chosen ground ,</l>
     <l n="420">The theatre of war for champions so renowned ;</l>
     <l n="421">And take the patron 's place of either knight , }</l>
     <l n="422">With eyes impartial to behold the fight ; }</l>
     <l n="423">And heaven of me so judge , as I shall judge aright . }</l>
     <l n="424">If both are satisfied with this accord ,</l>
     <l n="425">Swear , by the laws of knighthood , on my sword .—</l>
     <l n="426">Who now but Palamon exults with joy ?</l>
     <l n="427">And ravished Arcite seems to touch the sky :</l>
     <l n="428">The whole assembled troop was pleased as well ,</l>
     <l n="429">Extol the award , and on their knees they fell</l>
     <l n="430">To bless the gracious king . The knights , with leave</l>
     <l n="431">Departing from the place , his last commands receive ;</l>
     <l n="432">On Emily with equal ardour look ,</l>
     <l n="433">And from her eyes their inspiration took .</l>
     <l n="434">From thence to Thebes ’ old walls pursue their way ,</l>
     <l n="435">Each to provide his champions for the day .</l>
     <l n="436">It might be deemed , on our historian 's part ,</l>
     <l n="437">Or too much negligence , or want of art ,</l>
     <l n="438">If he forgot the vast magnificence</l>
     <l n="439">Of royal Theseus , and his large expence .</l>
     <l n="440">He first inclosed for lists a level ground ,</l>
     <l n="441">The whole circumference a mile around ;</l>
     <l n="442">The form was circular ; and all without</l>
     <l n="443">A trench was sunk , to moat the place about .</l>
     <l n="444">Within an amphitheatre appeared ,</l>
     <l n="445">Raised in degrees ; to sixty paces reared ;</l>
     <l n="446">That when a man was placed in one degree ,</l>
     <l n="447">Height was allowed for him above to see .</l>
     <l n="448">Eastward was built a gate of marble white ;</l>
     <l n="449">The like adorned the western opposite .</l>
     <l n="450">A nobler object than this fabric was ,</l>
     <l n="451">Rome never saw , nor of so vast a space :</l>
     <l n="452">For , rich with spoils of many a conquered land ,</l>
     <l n="453">All arts and artists Theseus could command :</l>
     <l n="454">Who sold for hire , or wrought for better fame ,</l>
     <l n="455">The master-painters , and the carvers , came .</l>
     <l n="456">So rose within the compass of the year</l>
     <l n="457">An age 's work , a glorious theatre .</l>
     <l n="458">Then o'er its eastern gate was raised above</l>
     <l n="459">A temple , sacred to the queen of love ;</l>
     <l n="460">An altar stood below ; on either hand</l>
     <l n="461">A priest with roses crowned , who held a myrtle wand .</l>
     <l n="462">The dome of Mars was on the gate opposed ,</l>
     <l n="463">And on the north a turret was inclosed ,</l>
     <l n="464">Within the wall of alabaster white , }</l>
     <l n="465">And crimson coral for the queen of night , }</l>
     <l n="466">Who takes in sylvan sports her chaste delight . }</l>
     <l n="467">Within these oratories might you see</l>
     <l n="468">Rich carvings , portraitures , and imagery ;</l>
     <l n="469">Where every figure to the life expressed</l>
     <l n="470">The godhead 's power to whom it was addressed .</l>
     <l n="471">In Venus ’ temple on the sides were seen</l>
     <l n="472">The broken slumbers of enamoured men ;</l>
     <l n="473">Prayers that even spoke , and pity seemed to call ,</l>
     <l n="474">And issuing sighs that smoked along the wall ;</l>
     <l n="475">Complaints , and hot desires , the lover 's hell ,</l>
     <l n="476">And scalding tears that wore a channel where they fell ;</l>
     <l n="477">And all around were nuptial bonds , the ties }</l>
     <l n="478">Of love 's assurance , and a train of lies , }</l>
     <l n="479">That , made in lust , conclude in perjuries ; }</l>
     <l n="480">Beauty , and Youth , and Wealth , and Luxury ,</l>
     <l n="481">And spritely Hope , and short-enduring Joy ;</l>
     <l n="482">And Sorceries to raise the infernal powers ,</l>
     <l n="483">And Sigils framed in planetary hours ;</l>
     <l n="484">Expence , and after-thought , and idle care ,</l>
     <l n="485">And doubts of motley hue , and dark despair ;</l>
     <l n="486">Suspicions , and fantastical surmise ,</l>
     <l n="487">And Jealousy suffused , with jaundice in her eyes ,</l>
     <l n="488">Discolouring all she viewed , in tawny dressed ,</l>
     <l n="489">Down-looked , and with a cuckow on her fist .</l>
     <l n="490">Opposed to her , on t'other side advance</l>
     <l n="491">The costly feast , the carol , and the dance ,</l>
     <l n="492">Minstrels , and music , poetry , and play ,</l>
     <l n="493">And balls by night , and tournaments by day .</l>
     <l n="494">All these were painted on the wall , and more ;</l>
     <l n="495">With acts and monuments of times before ,</l>
     <l n="496">And others added by prophetic doom ,</l>
     <l n="497">And lovers yet unborn , and loves to come ;</l>
     <l n="498">For there , the Idalian mount , and Citheron ,</l>
     <l n="499">The court of Venus , was in colours drawn ;</l>
     <l n="500">Before the palace-gate , in careless dress ,</l>
     <l n="501">And loose array , sat portress Idleness ;</l>
     <l n="502">There , by the fount , Narcissus pined alone ; }</l>
     <l n="503">There Sampson was , with wiser Solomon ,<span corresp="#note154" type="note_anchor">[ 154 ]</span>}</l>
     <l n="504">And all the mighty names by love undone . }</l>
     <l n="505">Medea 's charms were there , Circean feasts ,</l>
     <l n="506">With bowls that turned enamoured youths to beasts .</l>
     <l n="507">Here might be seen , that beauty , wealth , and wit ,</l>
     <l n="508">And prowess , to the power of love submit ;</l>
     <l n="509">The spreading snare for all mankind is laid ,</l>
     <l n="510">And lovers all betray , and are betrayed .</l>
     <l n="511">The goddess ’ self some noble hand had wrought ;</l>
     <l n="512">Smiling she seemed , and full of pleasing thought ;</l>
     <l n="513">From ocean , as she first began to rise ,</l>
     <l n="514">And smoothed the ruffled seas , and cleared the skies ,</l>
     <l n="515">She trod the brine , all bare below the breast ,</l>
     <l n="516">And the green waves but ill concealed the rest :</l>
     <l n="517">A lute she held ; and on her head was seen</l>
     <l n="518">A wreath of roses red , and myrtles green ;</l>
     <l n="519">Her turtles fanned the buxom air above ;</l>
     <l n="520">And , by his mother , stood an infant Love ,</l>
     <l n="521">With wings unfledged ; his eyes were banded o'er , }</l>
     <l n="522">His hands a bow , his back a quiver bore , }</l>
     <l n="523">Supplied with arrows bright and keen , a deadly store . }</l>
     <l n="524">But in the dome of mighty Mars the red ,</l>
     <l n="525">With different figures all the sides were spread ;</l>
     <l n="526">This temple , less in form , with equal grace ,</l>
     <l n="527">Was imitative of the first in Thrace ;</l>
     <l n="528">For that cold region was the loved abode ,</l>
     <l n="529">And sovereign mansion of the warrior god .</l>
     <l n="530">The landscape was a forest wide and bare ,</l>
     <l n="531">Where neither beast nor human kind repair ;</l>
     <l n="532">The fowl , that scent afar , the borders fly ,</l>
     <l n="533">And shun the bitter blast , and wheel about the sky .</l>
     <l n="534">A cake of scurf lies baking on the ground ,</l>
     <l n="535">And prickly stubs , instead of trees , are found ;</l>
     <l n="536">Or woods with knots and knares deformed and old ;</l>
     <l n="537">Headless the most , and hideous to behold ;</l>
     <l n="538">A rattling tempest through the branches went ,</l>
     <l n="539">That stripped them bare , and one sole way they bent .</l>
     <l n="540">Heaven froze above , severe ; the clouds congeal ,</l>
     <l n="541">And through the crystal vault appeared the standing hail .</l>
     <l n="542">Such was the face without ; a mountain stood</l>
     <l n="543">Threat'ning from high , and overlooked the wood ;</l>
     <l n="544">Beneath the lowring brow , and on a bent ,<span corresp="#note155" type="note_anchor">[ 155 ]</span></l>
     <l n="545">The temple stood of Mars armipotent ;</l>
     <l n="546">The frame of burnished steel , that cast a glare</l>
     <l n="547">From far , and seemed to thaw the freezing air .</l>
     <l n="548">A strait long entry to the temple led ,</l>
     <l n="549">Blind with high walls , and horror over head ;</l>
     <l n="550">Thence issued such a blast , and hollow roar ,</l>
     <l n="551">As threatened from the hinge to heave the door ;</l>
     <l n="552">In through that door a northern light there shone ;</l>
     <l n="553">‘ Twas all it had , for windows there were none .</l>
     <l n="554">The gate was adamant ; eternal frame !</l>
     <l n="555">Which , hewed by Mars himself , from Indian quarries came ,</l>
     <l n="556">The labour of a God ; and all along</l>
     <l n="557">Tough iron plates were clenched to make it strong .</l>
     <l n="558">A tun about was every pillar there ;</l>
     <l n="559">A polished mirror shone not half so clear .</l>
     <l n="560">There saw I how the secret felon wrought , }</l>
     <l n="561">And treason labouring in the traitor 's thought , }</l>
     <l n="562">And midwife Time the ripened plot to murders brought . }</l>
     <l n="563">There the red Anger dared the pallid Fear ;</l>
     <l n="564">Next stood Hypocrisy , with holy leer ;</l>
     <l n="565">Soft smiling , and demurely looking down ,</l>
     <l n="566">But hid the dagger underneath the gown ;</l>
     <l n="567">The assassinating wife , the household fiend ;</l>
     <l n="568">And , far the blackest there , the traitor-friend .</l>
     <l n="569">On t'other side there stood Destruction bare ,</l>
     <l n="570">Unpunished Rapine , and a waste of war ;</l>
     <l n="571">Contest , with sharpened knives , in cloisters drawn ,</l>
     <l n="572">And all with blood bespread the holy lawn .</l>
     <l n="573">Loud menaces were heard , and foul disgrace , }</l>
     <l n="574">And bawling infamy , in language base ; }</l>
     <l n="575">Till sense was lost in sound , and silence fled the place . }</l>
     <l n="576">The slayer of himself yet saw I there ,</l>
     <l n="577">The gore congealed was clotted in his hair ;</l>
     <l n="578">With eyes half-closed , and gaping mouth he lay ,</l>
     <l n="579">And grim , as when he breathed his sullen soul away .</l>
     <l n="580">In midst of all the dome , Misfortune sat ,</l>
     <l n="581">And gloomy Discontent , and fell Debate ,</l>
     <l n="582">And Madness laughing in his ireful mood ;</l>
     <l n="583">And armed complaint on theft ; and cries of blood .</l>
     <l n="584">There was the murdered corpse in covert laid ,</l>
     <l n="585">And violent death in thousand shapes displayed ;</l>
     <l n="586">The city to the soldier 's rage resigned ;</l>
     <l n="587">Successless wars , and poverty behind :</l>
     <l n="588">Ships burnt in fight , or forced on rocky shores ,</l>
     <l n="589">And the rash hunter strangled by the boars ;</l>
     <l n="590">The new-born babe by nurses overlaid ;</l>
     <l n="591">And the cook caught within the raging fire he made .</l>
     <l n="592">All ills of Mars his nature , flame , and steel ;</l>
     <l n="593">The gasping charioteer , beneath the wheel</l>
     <l n="594">Of his own car ; the ruined house , that falls</l>
     <l n="595">And intercepts her lord betwixt the walls :</l>
     <l n="596">The whole division that to Mars pertains ,</l>
     <l n="597">All trades of death that deal in steel for gains ,</l>
     <l n="598">Were there ; the butcher , armourer , and smith ,</l>
     <l n="599">Who forges sharpened faulchions , or the scythe .</l>
     <l n="600">The scarlet conquest on a tower was placed ,</l>
     <l n="601">With shouts , and soldiers ’ acclamations graced :</l>
     <l n="602">A pointed sword hung threat'ning o'er his head ,</l>
     <l n="603">Sustained but by a slender twine of thread .</l>
     <l n="604">There saw I Mars his ides , the Capitol ,</l>
     <l n="605">The seer in vain foretelling Cæsar 's fall ;</l>
     <l n="606">The last triumvirs , and the wars they move ,</l>
     <l n="607">And Antony , who lost the world for love .</l>
     <l n="608">These , and a thousand more , the fane adorn ;</l>
     <l n="609">Their fates were painted ere the men were born ,</l>
     <l n="610">All copied from the heavens , and ruling force</l>
     <l n="611">Of the red star , in his revolving course .</l>
     <l n="612">The form of Mars high on a chariot stood ,</l>
     <l n="613">All sheathed in arms , and gruffly looked the God ;</l>
     <l n="614">Two geomantic figures were displayed }</l>
     <l n="615">Above his head , a warrior and a maid ,<span corresp="#note156" type="note_anchor">[ 156 ]</span>}</l>
     <l n="616">One when direct , and one when retrograde .<span corresp="#note157" type="note_anchor">[ 157 ]</span>}</l>
     <l n="617">Tired with deformities of death , I haste</l>
     <l n="618">To the third temple , of Diana chaste .</l>
     <l n="619">A sylvan scene with various greens was drawn ,</l>
     <l n="620">Shades on the sides , and in the midst a lawn ;</l>
     <l n="621">The silver Cynthia , with her nymphs around ,</l>
     <l n="622">Pursued the flying deer , the woods with horns resound :</l>
     <l n="623">Calisto there stood manifest of shame ,</l>
     <l n="624">And , turned a bear , the northern star became :</l>
     <l n="625">Her son was next , and , by peculiar grace ,</l>
     <l n="626">In the cold circle held the second place :</l>
     <l n="627">The stag Acteon in the stream had spied</l>
     <l n="628">The naked huntress , and for seeing died ;</l>
     <l n="629">His hounds , unknowing of his change , pursue</l>
     <l n="630">The chace , and their mistaken master slew .</l>
     <l n="631">Peneian Daphne too was there , to see</l>
     <l n="632">Apollo 's love before , and now his tree .</l>
     <l n="633">The adjoining fane the assembled Greeks expressed ,</l>
     <l n="634">And hunting of the Caledonian beast .</l>
     <l n="635">Oenides ’ valour , and his envied prize ;</l>
     <l n="636">The fatal power of Atalanta 's eyes ;</l>
     <l n="637">Diana 's vengeance on the victor shown ,</l>
     <l n="638">The murdress mother , and consuming son ;</l>
     <l n="639">The Volscian queen extended on the plain ;</l>
     <l n="640">The treason punished , and the traitor slain .</l>
     <l n="641">The rest were various huntings , well designed ,</l>
     <l n="642">And savage beasts destroyed , of every kind .</l>
     <l n="643">The graceful goddess was arrayed in green ; }</l>
     <l n="644">About her feet were little beagles seen , }</l>
     <l n="645">That watched , with upward eyes , the motions of their queen . }</l>
     <l n="646">Her legs were buskined , and the left before , }</l>
     <l n="647">In act to shoot , a silver bow she bore , }</l>
     <l n="648">And at her back a painted quiver wore . }</l>
     <l n="649">She trod a wexing moon , that soon would wane ,</l>
     <l n="650">And , drinking borrowed light , be filled again ;</l>
     <l n="651">With downcast eyes , as seeming to survey</l>
     <l n="652">The dark dominions , her alternate sway .</l>
     <l n="653">Before her stood a woman in her throes ,</l>
     <l n="654">And called Lucina 's aid , her burden to disclose .</l>
     <l n="655">All these the painter drew with such command ,</l>
     <l n="656">That Nature snatched the pencil from his hand ,</l>
     <l n="657">Ashamed and angry that his art could feign ,</l>
     <l n="658">And mend the tortures of a mother 's pain .</l>
     <l n="659">Theseus beheld the fanes of every God ,</l>
     <l n="660">And thought his mighty cost was well bestowed .</l>
     <l n="661">So princes now their poets should regard ;</l>
     <l n="662">But few can write , and fewer can reward .</l>
     <l n="663">The theatre thus raised , the lists enclosed ,</l>
     <l n="664">And all with vast magnificence disposed ,</l>
     <l n="665">We leave the monarch pleased , and haste to bring</l>
     <l n="666">The knights to combat , and their arms to sing .</l>

    <head>THE KNIGHT 'S TALE .</head>
    <head>BOOK III .</head>
     <l n="1">The day approached when Fortune should decide</l>
     <l n="2">The important enterprize , and give the bride ;</l>
     <l n="3">For now the rivals round the world had sought ,</l>
     <l n="4">And each his number , well-appointed , brought .</l>
     <l n="5">The nations , far and near , contend in choice ,</l>
     <l n="6">And send the flower of war by public voice ;</l>
     <l n="7">That after , or before , were never known</l>
     <l n="8">Such chiefs , as each an army seemed alone :</l>
     <l n="9">Beside the champions , all of high degree ,</l>
     <l n="10">Who knighthood loved , and deeds of chivalry ,</l>
     <l n="11">Thronged to the lists , and envied to behold</l>
     <l n="12">The names of others , not their own , enrolled .</l>
     <l n="13">Nor seems it strange ; for every noble knight , }</l>
     <l n="14">Who loves the fair , and is endued with might , }</l>
     <l n="15">In such a quarrel would be proud to fight . }</l>
     <l n="16">There breathes not scarce a man on British ground ,</l>
     <l n="17">( An isle for love , and arms , of old renowned ,)</l>
     <l n="18">But would have sold his life to purchase fame ,</l>
     <l n="19">To Palamon or Arcite sent his name ;</l>
     <l n="20">And had the land selected of the best ,</l>
     <l n="21">Half had come hence , and let the world provide the rest .</l>
     <l n="22">A hundred knights with Palamon there came ,</l>
     <l n="23">Approved in fight , and men of mighty name ;</l>
     <l n="24">Their arms were several , as their nations were ,</l>
     <l n="25">But furnished all alike with sword and spear .</l>
     <l n="26">Some wore coat armour , imitating scale ,</l>
     <l n="27">And next their skins were stubborn shirts of mail ;</l>
     <l n="28">Some wore a breastplate and a light juppon ,</l>
     <l n="29">Their horses clothed with rich caparison ;</l>
     <l n="30">Some for defence would leathern bucklers use ,</l>
     <l n="31">Of folded hides , and others shields of Pruce .<span corresp="#note158" type="note_anchor">[ 158 ]</span></l>
     <l n="32">One hung a pole-axe at his saddle-bow ,</l>
     <l n="33">And one a heavy mace to stun the foe ;</l>
     <l n="34">One for his legs and knees provided well ,</l>
     <l n="35">With jambeux<span corresp="#note159" type="note_anchor">[ 159 ]</span>armed , and double plates of steel ;<span corresp="#note160" type="note_anchor">[ 160 ]</span></l>
     <l n="36">This on his helmet wore a lady 's glove ,</l>
     <l n="37">And that a sleeve embroidered by his love .</l>
     <l n="38">With Palamon , above the rest in place , }</l>
     <l n="39">Lycurgus came , the surly king of Thrace ; }</l>
     <l n="40">Black was his beard , and manly was his face : }</l>
     <l n="41">The balls of his broad eyes rolled in his head ,</l>
     <l n="42">And glared betwixt a yellow and a red ;</l>
     <l n="43">He looked a lion with a gloomy stare ,</l>
     <l n="44">And o'er his eye-brows hung his matted hair ;</l>
     <l n="45">Big-boned , and large of limbs , with sinews strong ,</l>
     <l n="46">Broad-shouldered , and his arms were round and long :</l>
     <l n="47">Four milk-white bulls ( the Thracian use of old )</l>
     <l n="48">Were yoked to draw his car of burnished gold .</l>
     <l n="49">Upright he stood , and bore aloft his shield ,</l>
     <l n="50">Conspicuous from afar , and overlooked the field .</l>
     <l n="51">His surcoat was a bear-skin on his back ;</l>
     <l n="52">His hair hung long behind , and glossy raven-black .</l>
     <l n="53">His ample forehead bore a coronet</l>
     <l n="54">With sparkling diamonds , and with rubies set ;</l>
     <l n="55">Ten brace , and more , of greyhounds , snowy fair , }</l>
     <l n="56">And tall as stags , ran loose , and coursed around his chair , }</l>
     <l n="57">A match for pards in flight , in grappling for the bear . }</l>
     <l n="58">With golden muzzles all their mouths were bound ,</l>
     <l n="59">And collars of the same their necks surround .</l>
     <l n="60">Thus through the field Lycurgus took his way ;</l>
     <l n="61">His hundred knights attend in pomp and proud array .</l>
     <l n="62">To match this monarch , with strong Arcite came</l>
     <l n="63">Emetrius king of Inde , a mighty name !</l>
     <l n="64">On a bay courser , goodly to behold ,</l>
     <l n="65">The trappings of his horse embossed with barbarous gold .</l>
     <l n="66">Not Mars bestrode a steed with greater grace ;</l>
     <l n="67">His surcoat o'er his arms was cloth of Thrace ,</l>
     <l n="68">Adorned with pearls , all orient , round , and great ;</l>
     <l n="69">His saddle was of gold , with emeralds set ;</l>
     <l n="70">His shoulders large a mantle did attire ,</l>
     <l n="71">With rubies thick , and sparkling as the fire ;</l>
     <l n="72">His amber-coloured locks in ringlets run ,</l>
     <l n="73">With graceful negligence , and shone against the sun .</l>
     <l n="74">His nose was aquiline , his eyes were blue ,</l>
     <l n="75">Ruddy his lips , and fresh and fair his hue ;</l>
     <l n="76">Some sprinkled freckles on his face were seen ,</l>
     <l n="77">Whose dusk set off the whiteness of the skin :</l>
     <l n="78">His awful presence did the crowd surprise ,</l>
     <l n="79">Nor durst the rash spectator meet his eyes ;</l>
     <l n="80">Eyes that confessed him born for kingly sway ,</l>
     <l n="81">So fierce , they flashed intolerable day .</l>
     <l n="82">His age in nature 's youthful prime appeared ,</l>
     <l n="83">And just began to bloom his yellow beard .</l>
     <l n="84">Whene'er he spoke , his voice was heard around ,</l>
     <l n="85">Loud as a trumpet , with a silver sound ;</l>
     <l n="86">A laurel wreathed his temples , fresh and green ,</l>
     <l n="87">And myrtle sprigs , the marks of love , were mixed between .</l>
     <l n="88">Upon his fist he bore , for his delight ,</l>
     <l n="89">An eagle well reclaimed , and lily white .</l>
     <l n="90">His hundred knights attend him to the war ,</l>
     <l n="91">All armed for battle , save their heads were bare .</l>
     <l n="92">Words and devices blazed on every shield ,</l>
     <l n="93">And pleasing was the terror of the field .</l>
     <l n="94">For kings , and dukes , and barons , you might see , }</l>
     <l n="95">Like sparkling stars , though different in degree , }</l>
     <l n="96">All for the increase of arms , and love of chivalry . }</l>
     <l n="97">Before the king tame leopards led the way ,</l>
     <l n="98">And troops of lions innocently play .</l>
     <l n="99">So Bacchus through the conquered Indies rode ,</l>
     <l n="100">And beasts in gambols frisked before the honest god .</l>
     <l n="101">In this array , the war of either side</l>
     <l n="102">Through Athens passed with military pride .</l>
     <l n="103">At prime , they entered on the Sunday morn ;</l>
     <l n="104">Rich tapestry spread the streets , and flowers the posts<span corresp="#note161" type="note_anchor">[ 161 ]</span>adorn .</l>
     <l n="105">The town was all a jubilee of feasts ;</l>
     <l n="106">So Theseus willed , in honour of his guests :</l>
     <l n="107">Himself with open arms the kings embraced ,</l>
     <l n="108">Then all the rest in their degrees were graced .</l>
     <l n="109">No harbinger was needful for the night ,</l>
     <l n="110">For every house was proud to lodge a knight .</l>
     <l n="111">I pass the royal treat , nor must relate</l>
     <l n="112">The gifts bestowed , nor how the champions sate ;</l>
     <l n="113">Who first , who last , or how the knights addressed</l>
     <l n="114">Their vows , or who was fairest at the feast ;</l>
     <l n="115">Whose voice , whose graceful dance did most surprise ;</l>
     <l n="116">Soft amorous sighs , and silent love of eyes .</l>
     <l n="117">The rivals call my muse another way ,</l>
     <l n="118">To sing their vigils for the ensuing day .</l>
     <l n="119">‘ Twas ebbing darkness , past the noon of night ,</l>
     <l n="120">And Phosphor , on the confines of the light ,</l>
     <l n="121">Promised the sun ; ere day began to spring , }</l>
     <l n="122">The tuneful lark already stretched her wing , }</l>
     <l n="123">And flickering on her nest , made short essays to sing , }</l>
     <l n="124">When wakeful Palamon , preventing day , }</l>
     <l n="125">Took to the royal lists his early way , }</l>
     <l n="126">To Venus at her fane , in her own house , to pray . }</l>
     <l n="127">There , falling on his knees before her shrine ,</l>
     <l n="128">He thus implored with prayers her power divine :—</l>
     <l n="129">Creator Venus , genial power of love ,</l>
     <l n="130">The bliss of men below , and Gods above !</l>
     <l n="131">Beneath the sliding sun thou runn'st thy race ,</l>
     <l n="132">Dost fairest shine , and best become thy place .</l>
     <l n="133">For thee the winds their eastern blasts forbear ,</l>
     <l n="134">Thy month reveals the spring , and opens all the year .</l>
     <l n="135">Thee , Goddess , thee the storms of winter fly , }</l>
     <l n="136">Earth smiles with flowers renewing , laughs the sky , }</l>
     <l n="137">And birds to lays of love their tuneful notes apply . }</l>
     <l n="138">For thee the lion loaths the taste of blood ,</l>
     <l n="139">And roaring hunts his female through the wood ;</l>
     <l n="140">For thee the bulls rebellow through the groves ,</l>
     <l n="141">And tempt the stream , and snuff their absent loves .</l>
     <l n="142">‘ Tis thine , whate'er is pleasant , good , or fair ; }</l>
     <l n="143">All nature is thy province , life thy care ; }</l>
     <l n="144">Thou mad'st the world , and dost the world repair . }</l>
     <l n="145">Thou gladder of the mount of Cytheron ,</l>
     <l n="146">Increase of Jove , companion of the sun !</l>
     <l n="147">If e'er Adonis touched thy tender heart ,</l>
     <l n="148">Have pity , Goddess , for thou know'st the smart !</l>
     <l n="149">Alas ! I have not words to tell my grief ;</l>
     <l n="150">To vent my sorrow would be some relief :</l>
     <l n="151">Light sufferings give us leisure to complain ;</l>
     <l n="152">We groan , but cannot speak , in greater pain .</l>
     <l n="153">O Goddess , tell thyself what I would say ,</l>
     <l n="154">Thou know'st it , and I feel too much to pray .</l>
     <l n="155">So grant my suit , as I enforce my might</l>
     <l n="156">In love to be thy champion , and thy knight ;</l>
     <l n="157">A servant to thy sex , a slave to thee ,</l>
     <l n="158">A foe profest to barren chastity .</l>
     <l n="159">Nor ask I fame or honour of the field ,</l>
     <l n="160">Nor choose I more to vanquish than to yield :</l>
     <l n="161">In my divine Emilia make me blest ,</l>
     <l n="162">Let fate , or partial chance , dispose the rest :</l>
     <l n="163">Find thou the manner , and the means prepare ;</l>
     <l n="164">Possession , more than conquest , is my care .</l>
     <l n="165">Mars is the warrior 's God ; in him it lies</l>
     <l n="166">On whom he favours to confer the prize ;</l>
     <l n="167">With smiling aspect you serenely move</l>
     <l n="168">In your fifth orb , and rule the realm of love .</l>
     <l n="169">The fates but only spin the coarser clue ,</l>
     <l n="170">The finest of the wool is left for you .</l>
     <l n="171">Spare me but one small portion of the twine ,</l>
     <l n="172">And let the sisters cut below your line :</l>
     <l n="173">The rest among the rubbish may they sweep ,</l>
     <l n="174">Or add it to the yarn of some old miser 's heap .</l>
     <l n="175">But , if you this ambitious prayer deny ,</l>
     <l n="176">( A wish , I grant , beyond mortality ,)</l>
     <l n="177">Then let me sink beneath proud Arcite 's arms ,</l>
     <l n="178">And I , once dead , let him possess her charms !—</l>
     <l n="179">Thus ended he ; then , with observance due ,</l>
     <l n="180">The sacred incense on her altar threw :</l>
     <l n="181">The curling smoke mounts heavy from the fires ;</l>
     <l n="182">At length it catches flame , and in a blaze expires ;</l>
     <l n="183">At once the gracious Goddess gave the sign ,</l>
     <l n="184">Her statue shook , and trembled all the shrine :</l>
     <l n="185">Pleased Palamon the tardy omen took ;</l>
     <l n="186">For , since the flames pursued the trailing smoke ,</l>
     <l n="187">He knew his boon was granted ; but the day</l>
     <l n="188">To distance driven , and joy adjourned with long delay .</l>
     <l n="189">Now morn with rosy light had streaked the sky ,</l>
     <l n="190">Up rose the sun , and up rose Emily ;</l>
     <l n="191">Addressed her early steps to Cynthia 's fane ,</l>
     <l n="192">In state attended by her maiden train ,</l>
     <l n="193">Who bore the vests that holy rites require ,</l>
     <l n="194">Incense , and odorous gums , and covered fire .</l>
     <l n="195">The plenteous horns with pleasant mead they crown ,</l>
     <l n="196">Nor wanted aught besides in honour of the moon .</l>
     <l n="197">Now while the temple smoked with hallowed steam ,</l>
     <l n="198">They wash the virgin in a living stream ;</l>
     <l n="199">The secret ceremonies I conceal ,</l>
     <l n="200">Uncouth , perhaps unlawful , to reveal :</l>
     <l n="201">But such they were as pagan use required ,</l>
     <l n="202">Performed by women when the men retired ,</l>
     <l n="203">Whose eyes profane their chaste mysterious rites</l>
     <l n="204">Might turn to scandal , or obscene delights .</l>
     <l n="205">Well-meaners think no harm ; but for the rest ,</l>
     <l n="206">Things sacred they pervert , and silence is the best .</l>
     <l n="207">Her shining hair , uncombed , was loosely spread ,</l>
     <l n="208">A crown of mastless oak adorned her head :</l>
     <l n="209">When to the shrine approached , the spotless maid</l>
     <l n="210">Had kindling fires on either altar laid :</l>
     <l n="211">( The rites were such as were observed of old ,</l>
     <l n="212">By Statius in his Theban story told . )</l>
     <l n="213">Then kneeling with her hands across her breast ,</l>
     <l n="214">Thus lowly she preferred her chaste request :—</l>
     <l n="215">O Goddess , haunter of the woodland green ,</l>
     <l n="216">To whom both heaven and earth and seas are seen ;</l>
     <l n="217">Queen of the nether skies , where half the year</l>
     <l n="218">Thy silver beams descend , and light the gloomy sphere ;</l>
     <l n="219">Goddess of maids , and conscious of our hearts ,</l>
     <l n="220">So keep me from the vengeance of thy darts ,</l>
     <l n="221">( Which Niobe 's devoted issue felt ,</l>
     <l n="222">When hissing through the skies the feathered deaths were dealt ,)</l>
     <l n="223">As I desire to live a virgin life ,</l>
     <l n="224">Nor know the name of mother or of wife .</l>
     <l n="225">Thy votress from my tender years I am ,</l>
     <l n="226">And love , like thee , the woods and sylvan game .</l>
     <l n="227">Like death , thou know'st , I loath the nuptial state , }</l>
     <l n="228">And man , the tyrant of our sex , I hate , }</l>
     <l n="229">A lowly servant , but a lofty mate ; }</l>
     <l n="230">Where love is duty , on the female side ;</l>
     <l n="231">On their 's mere sensual gust , and sought with surly pride .</l>
     <l n="232">Now by thy triple shape , as thou art seen</l>
     <l n="233">In heaven , earth , hell , and every where a queen ,</l>
     <l n="234">Grant this my first desire ; let discord cease ,</l>
     <l n="235">And make betwixt the rivals lasting peace :</l>
     <l n="236">Quench their hot fire , or far from me remove</l>
     <l n="237">The flame , and turn it on some other love ;</l>
     <l n="238">Or if my frowning stars have so decreed ,</l>
     <l n="239">That one must be rejected , one succeed ,</l>
     <l n="240">Make him my lord , within whose faithful breast</l>
     <l n="241">Is fixed my image , and who loves me best .</l>
     <l n="242">But , oh ! even that avert ! I chuse it not ,</l>
     <l n="243">But take it as the least unhappy lot .</l>
     <l n="244">A maid I am , and of thy virgin train ;</l>
     <l n="245">Oh , let me still that spotless name retain !</l>
     <l n="246">Frequent the forests , thy chaste will obey ,</l>
     <l n="247">And only make the beasts of chace my prey !—</l>
     <l n="248">The flames ascend on either altar clear ,</l>
     <l n="249">While thus the blameless maid addressed her prayer .</l>
     <l n="250">When lo ! the burning fire , that shone so bright ,</l>
     <l n="251">Flew off all sudden , with extinguished light ,</l>
     <l n="252">And left one altar dark a little space ,</l>
     <l n="253">Which turned self-kindled , and renewed the blaze ;</l>
     <l n="254">That<span corresp="#note162" type="note_anchor">[ 162 ]</span>other victor-flame a moment stood ,</l>
     <l n="255">Then fell , and lifeless left the extinguished wood ;</l>
     <l n="256">For ever lost , the irrevocable light</l>
     <l n="257">Forsook the black'ning coals , and sunk to night :</l>
     <l n="258">At either end it whistled as it flew , }</l>
     <l n="259">And as the brands were green , so dropped the dew ; }</l>
     <l n="260">Infected as it fell with sweat of sanguine hue . }</l>
     <l n="261">The maid from that ill omen turned her eyes ,</l>
     <l n="262">And with loud shrieks and clamours rent the skies ;</l>
     <l n="263">Nor knew what signified the boding sign ,</l>
     <l n="264">But found the powers displeased , and feared the wrath divine .</l>
     <l n="265">Then shook the sacred shrine , and sudden light</l>
     <l n="266">Sprung through the vaulted roof , and made the temple bright .</l>
     <l n="267">The Power , behold ! the Power in glory shone ,</l>
     <l n="268">By her bent bow and her keen arrows known ;</l>
     <l n="269">The rest , a huntress issuing from the wood ,</l>
     <l n="270">Reclining on her cornel spear she stood .</l>
     <l n="271">Then gracious thus began :— Dismiss thy fear ,</l>
     <l n="272">And heaven 's unchanged decrees attentive hear :</l>
     <l n="273">More powerful gods have torn thee from my side ,</l>
     <l n="274">Unwilling to resign , and doomed a bride :</l>
     <l n="275">The two contending knights are weighed above ;</l>
     <l n="276">One Mars protects , and one the Queen of love :</l>
     <l n="277">But which the man , is in the Thunderer 's breast ;</l>
     <l n="278">This he pronounced , ‘ tis he who loves thee best .</l>
     <l n="279">The fire , that , once extinct , revived again ,</l>
     <l n="280">Foreshews the love allotted to remain .</l>
     <l n="281">Farewell !— she said , and vanished from the place ;</l>
     <l n="282">The sheaf of arrows shook , and rattled in the case .</l>
     <l n="283">Aghast at this , the royal virgin stood ,</l>
     <l n="284">Disclaimed , and now no more a sister of the wood :</l>
     <l n="285">But to the parting Goddess thus she prayed ; }</l>
     <l n="286">Propitious still , be present to my aid , }</l>
     <l n="287">Nor quite abandon your once-favoured maid .— }</l>
     <l n="288">Then sighing she returned ; but smiled betwixt ,</l>
     <l n="289">With hopes , and fears , and joys with sorrows mixt .</l>
     <l n="290">The next returning planetary hour</l>
     <l n="291">Of Mars , who shared the heptarchy of power ,</l>
     <l n="292">His steps bold Arcite to the temple bent ,</l>
     <l n="293">To adore with pagan rites the power armipotent :</l>
     <l n="294">Then prostrate low before his altar lay ,</l>
     <l n="295">And raised his manly voice , and thus began to pray :—</l>
     <l n="296">Strong God of Arms , whose iron sceptre sways</l>
     <l n="297">The freezing North , and Hyperborean seas ,</l>
     <l n="298">And Scythian colds , and Thracia 's wintry coast ,</l>
     <l n="299">Where stand thy steeds , and thou art honoured most :</l>
     <l n="300">There most ; but every where thy power is known ,</l>
     <l n="301">The fortune of the fight is all thy own :</l>
     <l n="302">Terror is thine , and wild amazement , flung</l>
     <l n="303">From out thy chariot , withers even the strong ;</l>
     <l n="304">And disarray and shameful rout ensue ,</l>
     <l n="305">And force is added to the fainting crew —</l>
     <l n="306">Acknowledged as thou art , accept my prayer !</l>
     <l n="307">If aught I have achieved deserve thy care ;</l>
     <l n="308">If to my utmost power with sword and shield }</l>
     <l n="309">I dared the death , unknowing how to yield , }</l>
     <l n="310">And falling in my rank , still kept the field , }</l>
     <l n="311">Then let my arms prevail , by thee sustained ,</l>
     <l n="312">That Emily by conquest may be gained .</l>
     <l n="313">Have pity on my pains ; nor those unknown</l>
     <l n="314">To Mars , which , when a lover , were his own .</l>
     <l n="315">Venus , the public care of all above ,</l>
     <l n="316">Thy stubborn heart has softened into love :</l>
     <l n="317">Now , by her blandishments and powerful charms ,</l>
     <l n="318">When yielded she lay curling in thy arms ,</l>
     <l n="319">Even by thy shame , if shame it may be called ,</l>
     <l n="320">When Vulcan had thee in his net enthralled ;</l>
     <l n="321">( O envied ignominy , sweet disgrace ,</l>
     <l n="322">When every God that saw thee wished thy place ! )</l>
     <l n="323">By those dear pleasures , aid my arms in fight ,</l>
     <l n="324">And make me conquer in my patron 's right :</l>
     <l n="325">For I am young , a novice in the trade ,</l>
     <l n="326">The fool of love , unpractised to persuade :</l>
     <l n="327">And want the soothing arts that catch the fair ,</l>
     <l n="328">But , caught myself , lie struggling in the snare ;</l>
     <l n="329">And she I love , or laughs at all my pain ,</l>
     <l n="330">Or knows her worth too well , and pays me with disdain .</l>
     <l n="331">For sure I am , unless I win in arms ,</l>
     <l n="332">To stand excluded from Emilia 's charms :</l>
     <l n="333">Nor can my strength avail , unless , by thee</l>
     <l n="334">Endued with force , I gain the victory ;</l>
     <l n="335">Then for the fire which warmed thy generous heart ,</l>
     <l n="336">Pity thy subject 's pains , and equal smart .</l>
     <l n="337">So be the morrow 's sweat and labour mine ,</l>
     <l n="338">The palm and honour of the conquest thine :</l>
     <l n="339">Then shall the war , and stern debate , and strife</l>
     <l n="340">Immortal , be the business of my life ;</l>
     <l n="341">And in thy fane , the dusty spoils among ,</l>
     <l n="342">High on the burnished roof , my banner shall be hung ,</l>
     <l n="343">Ranked with my champions ’ bucklers ; and below ,</l>
     <l n="344">With arms reversed , the achievements of my foe ;</l>
     <l n="345">And while these limbs the vital spirit feeds ,</l>
     <l n="346">While day to night , and night to day succeeds ,</l>
     <l n="347">Thy smoking altar shall be fat with food</l>
     <l n="348">Of incense , and the grateful steam of blood ;</l>
     <l n="349">Burnt-offerings morn and evening shall be thine ,</l>
     <l n="350">And fires eternal in thy temple shine .</l>
     <l n="351">This bush of yellow beard , this length of hair ,</l>
     <l n="352">Which from my birth inviolate I bear ,</l>
     <l n="353">Guiltless of steel , and from the razor free ,</l>
     <l n="354">Shall fall a plenteous crop , reserved for thee .</l>
     <l n="355">So may my arms with victory be blest ,</l>
     <l n="356">I ask no more , let fate dispose the rest .—</l>
     <l n="357">The champion ceased : there followed in the close</l>
     <l n="358">A hollow groan ; a murmuring wind arose ;</l>
     <l n="359">The rings of iron , that on the doors were hung ,</l>
     <l n="360">Sent out a jarring sound , and harshly rung :</l>
     <l n="361">The bolted gates flew open at the blast ,</l>
     <l n="362">The storm rushed in , and Arcite stood aghast ;</l>
     <l n="363">The flames were blown aside , yet shone they bright ,</l>
     <l n="364">Fanned by the wind , and gave a ruffled light .</l>
     <l n="365">Then from the ground a scent began to rise ,</l>
     <l n="366">Sweet smelling as accepted sacrifice :</l>
     <l n="367">This omen pleased , and , as the flames aspire ,</l>
     <l n="368">With odorous incense Arcite heaps the fire :</l>
     <l n="369">Nor wanted hymns to Mars , or heathen charms :</l>
     <l n="370">At length the nodding statue clashed his arms ,</l>
     <l n="371">And with a sullen sound and feeble cry ,</l>
     <l n="372">Half-sunk , and half-pronounced the word of victory .</l>
     <l n="373">For this , with soul devout , he thanked the God ,</l>
     <l n="374">And , of success secure , returned to his abode .</l>
     <l n="375">These vows , thus granted , raised a strife above</l>
     <l n="376">Betwixt the God of War and Queen of Love .</l>
     <l n="377">She , granting first , had right of time to plead ;</l>
     <l n="378">But he had granted too , nor would recede .</l>
     <l n="379">Jove was for Venus , but he feared his wife ,</l>
     <l n="380">And seemed unwilling to decide the strife ;</l>
     <l n="381">Till Saturn from his leaden throne arose ,</l>
     <l n="382">And found a way the difference to compose :</l>
     <l n="383">Though sparing of his grace , to mischief bent ,</l>
     <l n="384">He seldom does a good with good intent .</l>
     <l n="385">Wayward , but wise ; by long experience taught ,</l>
     <l n="386">To please both parties , for ill ends , he sought :</l>
     <l n="387">For this advantage age from youth has won ,</l>

     <l n="389">By fortune he was now to Venus trined ,</l>
     <l n="390">And with stern Mars in Capricorn was joined :</l>
     <l n="391">Of him disposing in his own abode ,</l>
     <l n="392">He soothed the Goddess , while he gulled the God :—</l>
     <l n="393">Cease , daughter , to complain , and stint the strife ;</l>
     <l n="394">Thy Palamon shall have his promised wife :</l>
     <l n="395">And Mars , the lord of conquest , in the fight</l>
     <l n="396">With palm and laurel shall adorn his knight .</l>
     <l n="397">Wide is my course , nor turn I to my place ,</l>

     <l n="399">Man feels me , when I press the ethereal plains ;</l>
     <l n="400">My hand is heavy , and the wound remains .</l>
     <l n="401">Mine is the shipwreck , in a watery sign ;</l>
     <l n="402">And in an earthy , the dark dungeon mine .</l>
     <l n="403">Cold shivering agues , melancholy care , }</l>

     <l n="412">Mine is the privy poisoning ; I command</l>
     <l n="413">Unkindly seasons , and ungrateful land .</l>
     <l n="414">By me king 's palaces are pushed to ground ,</l>

     <l n="428">In Athens , all was pleasure , mirth , and play ,</l>
     <l n="429">All proper to the spring , and spritely May :</l>
     <l n="430">Which every soul inspired with such delight ,</l>
     <l n="431">‘ Twas jesting all the day , and love at night .</l>
     <l n="432">Heaven smiled , and gladded was the heart of man ;</l>

     <l n="434">At length in sleep their bodies they compose ,</l>
     <l n="435">And dreamt the future fight , and early rose .</l>
     <l n="436">Now scarce the dawning day began to spring ,</l>
     <l n="437">As at a signal given , the streets with clamours ring :</l>
     <l n="438">At once the crowd arose ; confused and high , }</l>
     <l n="439">Even from the heaven , was heard a shouting cry , }</l>
     <l n="440">For Mars was early up , and rouzed the sky . }</l>
     <l n="441">The gods came downward to behold the wars ,</l>
     <l n="442">Sharpening their sights , and leaning from their stars .</l>
     <l n="443">The neighing of the generous horse was heard ,</l>
     <l n="444">For battle by the busy groom prepared :</l>
     <l n="445">Rustling of harness , rattling of the shield ,</l>
     <l n="446">Clattering of armour , furbished for the field .</l>
     <l n="447">Crowds to the castle mounted up the street ,</l>
     <l n="448">Battering the pavement with their coursers ’ feet :</l>
     <l n="449">The greedy sight might there devour the gold</l>
     <l n="450">Of glittering arms , too dazzling to behold ;</l>
     <l n="451">And polished steel , that cast the view aside ,</l>
     <l n="452">And crested morions , with their plumy pride .</l>
     <l n="453">Knights , with a long retinue of their squires ,</l>
     <l n="454">In gaudy liveries march , and quaint attires .</l>
     <l n="455">One laced the helm , another held the lance ;</l>
     <l n="456">A third the shining buckler did advance .</l>
     <l n="457">The courser pawed the ground with restless feet ,</l>
     <l n="458">And snorting foamed , and champed the golden bit .</l>
     <l n="459">The smiths and armourers on palfreys ride , }</l>
     <l n="460">Files in their hands , and hammers at their side , }</l>

     <l n="462">The yeomen guard the streets , in seemly bands ;</l>
     <l n="463">And clowns come crowding on , with cudgels in their hands .</l>
     <l n="464">The trumpets , next the gate , in order placed ,</l>
     <l n="465">Attend the sign to sound the martial blast :</l>
     <l n="466">The palace-yard is filled with floating tides ,</l>
     <l n="467">And the last comers bear the former to the sides .</l>
     <l n="468">The throng is in the midst ; the common crew</l>
     <l n="469">Shut out , the hall admits the better few</l>
     <l n="470">In knots they stand , or in a rank they walk ,</l>
     <l n="471">Serious in aspect , earnest in their talk :</l>
     <l n="472">Factious , and favouring this or t'other side .</l>
     <l n="473">As their strong fancies and weak reason guide .</l>
     <l n="474">Their wagers back their wishes ; numbers hold</l>
     <l n="475">With the fair freckled king , and beard of gold :</l>
     <l n="476">So vigorous are his eyes , such rays they cast ,</l>
     <l n="477">So prominent his eagle 's beak is placed .</l>
     <l n="478">But most their looks on the black monarch bend ,</l>
     <l n="479">His rising muscles , and his brawn commend ;</l>
     <l n="480">His double-biting axe , and beamy spear ,</l>
     <l n="481">Each asking a gigantic force to rear .</l>
     <l n="482">All spoke as partial favour moved the mind ;</l>
     <l n="483">And , safe themselves , at others ’ cost divined .</l>
     <l n="484">Waked by the cries , the Athenian chief arose ,</l>
     <l n="485">The knightly forms of combat to dispose ;</l>
     <l n="486">And passing through the obsequious guards , he sate</l>
     <l n="487">Conspicuous on a throne , sublime in state ;</l>
     <l n="488">There , for the two contending knights he sent ;</l>
     <l n="489">Armed cap-a-pee , with reverence low they bent ;</l>
     <l n="490">He smiled on both , and with superior look</l>
     <l n="491">Alike their offered adoration took .</l>
     <l n="492">The people press on every side to see</l>
     <l n="493">Their awful prince , and hear his high decree .</l>
     <l n="494">Then signing to the heralds with his hand ,</l>
     <l n="495">They gave his orders from their lofty stand .</l>
     <l n="496">Silence is thrice enjoined ; then thus aloud</l>
     <l n="497">The king at arms bespeaks the knights and listening crowd :—</l>
     <l n="498">Our sovereign lord has pondered in his mind</l>
     <l n="499">The means to spare the blood of gentle kind ;</l>
     <l n="500">And of his grace , and inborn clemency ,</l>
     <l n="501">He modifies his first severe decree ,</l>
     <l n="502">The keener edge of battle to rebate ,</l>
     <l n="503">The troops for honour fighting , not for hate .</l>
     <l n="504">He wills , not death should terminate their strife ,</l>
     <l n="505">And wounds , if wounds ensue , be short of life ;</l>
     <l n="506">But issues , ere the fight , his dread command ,</l>
     <l n="507">That slings afar , and poniards hand to hand ,</l>
     <l n="508">Be banished from the field ; that none shall dare</l>
     <l n="509">With shortened sword to stab in closer war ;</l>
     <l n="510">But in fair combat fight with manly strength ,</l>
     <l n="511">Nor push with biting point , but strike at length .</l>
     <l n="512">The tourney is allowed but one career ,</l>
     <l n="513">Of the tough ash , with the sharp-grinded spear ;</l>
     <l n="514">But knights unhorsed may rise from off the plain ,</l>
     <l n="515">And fight on foot their honour to regain ;</l>
     <l n="516">Nor , if at mischief<span corresp="#note165" type="note_anchor">[ 165 ]</span>taken , on the ground</l>
     <l n="517">Be slain , but prisoners to the pillar bound ,</l>
     <l n="518">At either barrier placed ; nor ( captives made ,)</l>
     <l n="519">Be freed , or armed anew the fight invade .</l>
     <l n="520">The chief of either side , bereft of life ,</l>
     <l n="521">Or yielded to his foe , concludes the strife .</l>
     <l n="522">Thus dooms the lord ; now , valiant knights and young ,</l>
     <l n="523">Fight each his fill with swords and maces long .—</l>
     <l n="524">The herald ends : The vaulted firmament</l>
     <l n="525">With loud acclaims and vast applause is rent :</l>
     <l n="526">Heaven guard a prince so gracious and so good ,</l>
     <l n="527">So just , and yet so provident of blood !</l>
     <l n="528">This was the general cry . The trumpets sound ,</l>
     <l n="529">And warlike symphony is heard around .</l>
     <l n="530">The marching troops through Athens take their way ,</l>
     <l n="531">The great earl-marshal orders their array .</l>
     <l n="532">The fair from high the passing pomp behold ;</l>
     <l n="533">A rain of flowers is from the windows rolled .</l>
     <l n="534">The casements are with golden tissue spread ,</l>
     <l n="535">And horses hoofs , for earth , on silken tapestry tread .</l>
     <l n="536">The king goes midmost , and the rivals ride</l>
     <l n="537">In equal rank , and close his either side .</l>
     <l n="538">Next after these , there rode the royal wife ,</l>
     <l n="539">With Emily , the cause , and the reward of strife .</l>
     <l n="540">The following cavalcade , by three and three ,</l>
     <l n="541">Proceed by titles marshalled in degree .</l>
     <l n="542">Thus through the southern gate they take their way ,</l>
     <l n="543">And at the lists arrived ere prime of day .</l>
     <l n="544">There , parting from the king , the chiefs divide ,</l>
     <l n="545">And wheeling east and west , before their many ride .</l>
     <l n="546">The Athenian monarch mounts his throne on high ,</l>
     <l n="547">And after him the queen and Emily :</l>
     <l n="548">Next these , the kindred of the crown are graced</l>
     <l n="549">With nearer seats , and lords by ladies placed .</l>
     <l n="550">Scarce were they seated , when with clamours loud</l>
     <l n="551">In rushed at once a rude promiscuous crowd :</l>
     <l n="552">The guards , and then each other overbear ,</l>
     <l n="553">And in a moment throng the spacious theatre .</l>
     <l n="554">Now changed the jarring noise to whispers low ,</l>
     <l n="555">As winds forsaking seas more softly blow ;</l>
     <l n="556">When at the western gate , on which the car</l>
     <l n="557">Is placed aloft , that bears the God of war ,</l>
     <l n="558">Proud Arcite , entering armed before his train ,</l>
     <l n="559">Stops at the barrier , and divides the plain .</l>
     <l n="560">Red was his banner , and displayed abroad</l>
     <l n="561">The bloody colours of his patron God .</l>
     <l n="562">At that self moment enters Palamon</l>
     <l n="563">The gate of Venus , and the rising Sun ;</l>
     <l n="564">Waved by the wanton winds , his banner flies ,</l>
     <l n="565">All maiden white , and shares the people 's eyes .</l>
     <l n="566">From east to west , look all the world around ,</l>
     <l n="567">Two troops so matched were never to be found ;</l>
     <l n="568">Such bodies built for strength , of equal age ,</l>
     <l n="569">In stature sized ; so proud an equipage :</l>
     <l n="570">The nicest eye could no distinction make ,</l>
     <l n="571">Where lay the advantage , or what side to take .</l>
     <l n="572">Thus ranged , the herald for the last proclaims</l>
     <l n="573">A silence , while they answered to their names :</l>
     <l n="574">For so the king decreed , to shun with<span corresp="#note166" type="note_anchor">[ 166 ]</span>care</l>
     <l n="575">The fraud of musters false , the common bane of war .</l>
     <l n="576">The tale was just , and then the gates were closed ;</l>
     <l n="577">And chief to chief , and troop to troop opposed .</l>
     <l n="578">The heralds last retired , and loudly cried ,—</l>
     <l n="579">The fortune of the field be fairly tried !</l>
     <l n="580">At this , the challenger , with fierce defy , }</l>
     <l n="581">His trumpets sounds ; the challenged makes reply . }</l>
     <l n="582">With clangour rings the field , resounds the vaulted sky . }</l>
     <l n="583">Their vizors closed , their lances in the rest ,</l>
     <l n="584">Or at the helmet pointed , or the crest ,</l>
     <l n="585">They vanish from the barrier , speed the race ,</l>
     <l n="586">And spurring see decrease the middle space .</l>
     <l n="587">A cloud of smoke envelopes either host ,</l>
     <l n="588">And all at once the combatants are lost :</l>
     <l n="589">Darkling they join adverse , and shock unseen ,</l>
     <l n="590">Coursers with coursers jostling , men with men :</l>
     <l n="591">As labouring in eclipse , a while they stay ,</l>
     <l n="592">Till the next blast of wind restores the day .</l>
     <l n="593">They look anew ; the beauteous form of fight</l>
     <l n="594">Is changed , and war appears a grizzly sight .<span corresp="#note167" type="note_anchor">[ 167 ]</span></l>
     <l n="595">Two troops in fair array one moment shewed ,</l>
     <l n="596">The next , a field with fallen bodies strewed :</l>
     <l n="597">Not half the number in their seats are found ;</l>
     <l n="598">But men and steeds lie grovelling on the ground .</l>
     <l n="599">The points of spears are stuck within the shield ,</l>
     <l n="600">The steeds without their riders scour the field .</l>
     <l n="601">The knights , unhorsed , on foot renew the fight ;</l>
     <l n="602">The glittering faulchions cast a gleaming light ;</l>
     <l n="603">Hauberks and helms are hewed with many a wound ;</l>
     <l n="604">Out spins the streaming blood , and dyes the ground .</l>
     <l n="605">The mighty maces with such haste descend ,</l>
     <l n="606">They break the bones , and make the solid armour bend .</l>
     <l n="607">This thrusts amid the throng with furious force ;</l>
     <l n="608">Down goes , at once , the horseman and the horse :</l>
     <l n="609">That courser stumbles on the fallen steed ,</l>
     <l n="610">And floundring throws the rider o'er his head .</l>
     <l n="611">One rolls along , a foot-ball to his foes ;</l>
     <l n="612">One with a broken truncheon deals his blows .</l>
     <l n="613">This halting , this disabled with his wound ,</l>
     <l n="614">In triumph led , is to the pillar bound ,</l>
     <l n="615">Where by the king 's award he must abide ;</l>
     <l n="616">There goes a captive led on t'other side .</l>
     <l n="617">By fits they cease ; and leaning on the lance ,</l>
     <l n="618">Take breath a while , and to new fight advance .</l>
     <l n="619">Full oft the rivals met , and neither spared</l>
     <l n="620">His utmost force , and each forgot to ward .</l>
     <l n="621">The head of this was to the saddle bent ,</l>
     <l n="622">That<span corresp="#note168" type="note_anchor">[ 168 ]</span>other backward to the crupper sent :</l>
     <l n="623">Both were by turns unhorsed ; the jealous blows</l>
     <l n="624">Fall thick and heavy , when on foot they close .</l>
     <l n="625">So deep their faulchions bite , that every stroke</l>
     <l n="626">Pierced to the quick , and equal wounds they gave and took .</l>
     <l n="627">Borne far asunder by the tides of men ,</l>
     <l n="628">Like adamant and steel they meet again .</l>
     <l n="629">So when a tyger sucks the bullock 's blood , }</l>
     <l n="630">A famished lion issuing from the wood }</l>
     <l n="631">Roars lordly fierce , and challenges the food . }</l>
     <l n="632">Each claims possession , neither will obey ,</l>
     <l n="633">But both their paws are fastened on the prey ;</l>
     <l n="634">They bite , they tear ; and while in vain they strive ,</l>
     <l n="635">The swains come armed between , and both to distance drive .</l>
     <l n="636">At length , as fate foredoomed , and all things tend</l>
     <l n="637">By course of time to their appointed end ;</l>
     <l n="638">So when the sun to west was far declined ,</l>
     <l n="639">And both afresh in mortal battle joined ,</l>
     <l n="640">The strong Emetrius came in Arcite 's aid ,</l>
     <l n="641">And Palamon with odds was overlaid :</l>
     <l n="642">For turning short , he<span corresp="#note169" type="note_anchor">[ 169 ]</span>struck with all his might</l>
     <l n="643">Full on the helmet of the unwary knight .</l>
     <l n="644">Deep was the wound ; he staggered with the blow ,</l>
     <l n="645">And turned him to his unexpected foe ;</l>
     <l n="646">Whom with such force he struck , he felled him down ,</l>
     <l n="647">And cleft the circle of his golden crown .</l>
     <l n="648">But Arcite 's men , who now prevailed in fight ,</l>
     <l n="649">Twice ten at once surround the single knight :</l>
     <l n="650">O'erpowered , at length , they force him to the ground ,</l>
     <l n="651">Unyielded as he was , and to the pillar bound ;</l>
     <l n="652">And king Lycurgus , while he fought in vain</l>
     <l n="653">His friend to free , was tumbled on the plain .</l>
     <l n="654">Who now laments but Palamon , compelled</l>
     <l n="655">No more to try the fortune of the field !</l>
     <l n="656">And , worse than death , to view with hateful eyes</l>
     <l n="657">His rival 's conquest , and renounce the prize !</l>
     <l n="658">The royal judge on his tribunal placed ,</l>
     <l n="659">Who had beheld the fight from first to last ,</l>
     <l n="660">Bade cease the war ; pronouncing from on high</l>
     <l n="661">Arcite of Thebes had won the beauteous Emily .</l>
     <l n="662">The sound of trumpets to the voice replied , }</l>
     <l n="663">And round the royal lists the heralds cried ,— }</l>
     <l n="664">Arcite of Thebes has won the beauteous bride ! }</l>
     <l n="665">The people rend the skies with vast applause ;</l>
     <l n="666">All own the chief , when fortune owns the cause .</l>
     <l n="667">Arcite is owned even by the Gods above ,</l>
     <l n="668">And conquering Mars insults the Queen of Love .</l>
     <l n="669">So laughed he , when the rightful Titan failed ,</l>
     <l n="670">And Jove 's usurping arms in heaven prevailed .</l>
     <l n="671">Laughed all the powers who favour tyranny ,</l>
     <l n="672">And all the standing army of the sky .<span corresp="#note170" type="note_anchor">[ 170 ]</span></l>
     <l n="673">But Venus with dejected eyes appears ,</l>
     <l n="674">And , weeping , on the lists distilled her tears ;</l>
     <l n="675">Her will refused , which grieves a woman most ,</l>
     <l n="676">And , in her champion foiled , the cause of Love is lost .</l>
     <l n="677">Till Saturn said :— Fair daughter , now be still :</l>
     <l n="678">The blustering fool has satisfied his will ;</l>
     <l n="679">His boon is given ; his knight has gained the day ,</l>
     <l n="680">But lost the prize ; the arrears are yet to pay .</l>
     <l n="681">Thy hour is come , and mine the care shall be</l>
     <l n="682">To please thy knight , and set thy promise free .</l>
     <l n="683">Now while the heralds run the lists around ,</l>
     <l n="684">And Arcite , Arcite , heaven and earth resound ;</l>
     <l n="685">A miracle ( nor less could it be called )</l>
     <l n="686">Their joy with unexpected sorrow palled .</l>
     <l n="687">The victor knight had laid his helm aside ,</l>
     <l n="688">( Part for his ease , the greater part for pride ,)</l>
     <l n="689">Bare-headed , popularly low he bowed ,</l>
     <l n="690">And paid the salutations of the crowd ;</l>
     <l n="691">Then , spurring , at full speed , ran endlong on</l>
     <l n="692">Where Theseus sat on his imperial throne ;</l>
     <l n="693">Furious he drove , and upward cast his eye ,</l>
     <l n="694">Where next the queen was placed his Emily ;</l>
     <l n="695">Then passing , to the saddle-bow he bent ;</l>
     <l n="696">A sweet regard the gracious virgin lent ;</l>
     <l n="697">( For women , to the brave an easy prey ,</l>
     <l n="698">Still follow Fortune where she leads the way ;)</l>
     <l n="699">Just then from earth sprung out a flashing fire ,<span corresp="#note171" type="note_anchor">[ 171 ]</span></l>
     <l n="700">By Pluto sent , at Saturn 's bad desire :</l>
     <l n="701">The startling steed was seized with sudden fright ,</l>
     <l n="702">And , bounding , o'er the pommel cast the knight :</l>
     <l n="703">Forward he flew , and , pitching on his head ,</l>
     <l n="704">He quivered with his feet , and lay for dead .</l>
     <l n="705">Black was his countenance in a little space ,</l>
     <l n="706">For all the blood was gathered in his face .</l>
     <l n="707">Help was at hand : they reared him from the ground ,</l>
     <l n="708">And from his cumberous arms his limbs unbound ;</l>
     <l n="709">Then lanced a vein , and watched returning breath ;</l>
     <l n="710">It came , but clogged with symptoms of his death .</l>
     <l n="711">The saddle-bow the noble parts had prest ,</l>
     <l n="712">All bruised and mortified his manly breast .</l>
     <l n="713">Him still entranced , and in a litter laid ,</l>
     <l n="714">They bore from field , and to his bed conveyed .</l>
     <l n="715">At length he waked , and with a feeble cry ,</l>
     <l n="716">The word he first pronounced was Emily .</l>
     <l n="717">Meantime the king , though inwardly he mourned ,</l>
     <l n="718">In pomp triumphant to the town returned ,</l>
     <l n="719">Attended by the chiefs , who fought the field ;</l>
     <l n="720">( Now friendly mixed , and in one troop compelled . )</l>
     <l n="721">Composed his looks to counterfeited cheer ,</l>
     <l n="722">And bade them not for Arcite 's life to fear .</l>
     <l n="723">But that which gladded all the warrior train ,</l>
     <l n="724">Though most were sorely wounded , none were slain .</l>
     <l n="725">The surgeons soon despoiled them of their arms ,</l>
     <l n="726">And some with salves they cure , and some with charms ;</l>
     <l n="727">Foment the bruises , and the pains assuage ,</l>
     <l n="728">And heal their inward hurts with sovereign draughts of sage .</l>
     <l n="729">The king , in person , visits all around ,</l>
     <l n="730">Comforts the sick , congratulates the sound ;</l>
     <l n="731">Honours the princely chiefs , rewards the rest ,</l>
     <l n="732">And holds , for thrice three days , a royal feast .</l>
     <l n="733">None were disgraced , for falling is no shame ,</l>
     <l n="734">And cowardice alone is loss of fame .</l>
     <l n="735">The venturous knight is from the saddle thrown ;</l>
     <l n="736">But ‘ tis the fault of fortune , not his own :</l>
     <l n="737">If crowns and palms the conquering side adorn ,</l>
     <l n="738">The victor under better stars was born :</l>
     <l n="739">The brave man seeks not popular applause ,</l>
     <l n="740">Nor , overpowered with arms , deserts his cause ;</l>
     <l n="741">Unshamed , though foiled , he does the best he can ;</l>
     <l n="742">Force is of brutes , but honour is of man .</l>
     <l n="743">Thus Theseus smiled on all with equal grace ,</l>
     <l n="744">And each was set according to his place ;</l>
     <l n="745">With ease were reconciled the differing parts ,</l>
     <l n="746">For envy never dwells in noble hearts .</l>
     <l n="747">At length they took their leave , the time expired ,</l>
     <l n="748">Well pleased , and to their several homes retired .</l>
     <l n="749">Meanwhile the health of Arcite still impairs ;</l>
     <l n="750">From bad proceeds to worse , and mocks the leeches ’ cares :</l>
     <l n="751">Swollen is his breast , his inward pains increase ,</l>
     <l n="752">All means are used , and all without success .</l>
     <l n="753">The clotted blood lies heavy on his heart ,</l>
     <l n="754">Corrupts , and there remains in spite of art ;</l>
     <l n="755">Nor breathing veins , nor cupping , will prevail ;</l>
     <l n="756">All outward remedies and inward fail :</l>
     <l n="757">The mould of nature 's fabric is destroyed ,</l>
     <l n="758">Her vessels discomposed , her virtue void :</l>
     <l n="759">The bellows of his lungs begins to swell ; }</l>
     <l n="760">All out of frame is every secret cell , }</l>
     <l n="761">Nor can the good receive , nor bad expel . }</l>
     <l n="762">Those breathing organs , thus within opprest ,</l>
     <l n="763">With venom soon distend the sinews of his breast .</l>
     <l n="764">Nought profits him to save abandoned life ,</l>
     <l n="765">Nor vomits upward aid , nor downward laxative .</l>
     <l n="766">The midmost region battered and destroyed ,</l>
     <l n="767">When nature cannot work , the effect of art is void ;</l>
     <l n="768">For physic can but mend our crazy state ,</l>
     <l n="769">Patch an old building , not a new create .</l>
     <l n="770">Arcite is doomed to die in all his pride , }</l>
     <l n="771">Must leave his youth , and yield his beauteous bride , }</l>
     <l n="772">Gained hardly , against right , and unenjoyed . }</l>

     <l n="774">Conscience ( that of all physic works the last ) }</l>
     <l n="775">Caused him to send for Emily in haste . }</l>
     <l n="776">With her , at his desire , came Palamon ;</l>
     <l n="777">Then , on his pillow raised , he thus began :—</l>
     <l n="778">“ No language can express the smallest part</l>
     <l n="779">Of what I feel , and suffer in my heart ,</l>
     <l n="780">For you , whom best I love and value most :</l>
     <l n="781">But to your service I bequeath my ghost ;</l>
     <l n="782">Which , from this mortal body when untied ,</l>
     <l n="783">Unseen , unheard , shall hover at your side ;</l>
     <l n="784">Nor fright you waking , nor your sleep offend ,</l>
     <l n="785">But wait officious , and your steps attend .</l>
     <l n="786">How I have loved , excuse my faultering tongue ,</l>
     <l n="787">My spirits feeble , and my pains are strong :</l>
     <l n="788">This I may say , I only grieve to die ,</l>
     <l n="789">Because I lose my charming Emily .</l>
     <l n="790">To die , when heaven had put you in my power !</l>
     <l n="791">Fate could not chuse a more malicious hour .</l>
     <l n="792">What greater curse could envious fortune give ,</l>
     <l n="793">Than just to die , when I began to live !</l>
     <l n="794">Vain men ! how vanishing a bliss we crave ,</l>
     <l n="795">Now warm in love , now withering in the grave !</l>
     <l n="796">Never , O never more to see the sun !</l>
     <l n="797">Still dark , in a damp vault , and still alone !</l>
     <l n="798">This fate is common ; but I lose my breath</l>
     <l n="799">Near bliss , and yet not blessed , before my death .</l>
     <l n="800">Farewell ! but take me , dying , in your arms ,</l>
     <l n="801">‘ Tis all I can enjoy of all your charms :</l>
     <l n="802">This hand I cannot but in death resign ;</l>
     <l n="803">Ah , could I live ! but while I live ‘ tis mine .</l>
     <l n="804">I feel my end approach , and , thus embraced ,</l>
     <l n="805">Am pleased to die ; but hear me speak my last :</l>
     <l n="806">Ah , my sweet foe ! for you , and you alone ,</l>
     <l n="807">I broke my faith with injured Palamon .</l>
     <l n="808">But love the sense of right and wrong confounds ;</l>
     <l n="809">Strong love and proud ambition have no bounds .</l>
     <l n="810">And much , I doubt , should heaven my life prolong ,</l>
     <l n="811">I should return to justify my wrong ;</l>
     <l n="812">For , while my former flames remain within ,</l>
     <l n="813">Repentance is but want of power to sin .</l>
     <l n="814">With mortal hatred I pursued his life ,</l>
     <l n="815">Nor he , nor you , were guilty of the strife ;</l>
     <l n="816">Nor I , but as I loved ; yet all combined ,</l>
     <l n="817">Your beauty , and my impotence of mind ;</l>
     <l n="818">And his concurrent flame , that blew my fire ;</l>
     <l n="819">For still our kindred souls had one desire .</l>
     <l n="820">He had a moment 's right , in point of time ;</l>
     <l n="821">Had I seen first , then his had been the crime .</l>
     <l n="822">Fate made it mine , and justified his right ;</l>
     <l n="823">Nor holds this earth a more deserving knight ,</l>
     <l n="824">For virtue , valour , and for noble blood ,</l>
     <l n="825">Truth , honour , all that is comprised in good ;</l>
     <l n="826">So help me heaven , in all the world is none</l>
     <l n="827">So worthy to be loved as Palamon .</l>
     <l n="828">He loves you too , with such a holy fire ,</l>
     <l n="829">As will not , cannot , but with life expire :</l>
     <l n="830">Our vowed affections both have often tried ,</l>
     <l n="831">Nor any love but yours could ours divide .</l>
     <l n="832">Then , by my love 's inviolable band ,</l>
     <l n="833">By my long-suffering , and my short command ,</l>
     <l n="834">If e'er you plight your vows when I am gone ,</l>
     <l n="835">Have pity on the faithful Palamon .—</l>
     <l n="836">This was his last ; for death came on amain ,</l>
     <l n="837">And exercised below his iron reign ;</l>
     <l n="838">Then upward to the seat of life he goes ;</l>
     <l n="839">Sense fled before him , what he touched he froze :</l>
     <l n="840">Yet could he not his closing eyes withdraw ,</l>
     <l n="841">Though less and less of Emily he saw ;</l>
     <l n="842">So , speechless , for a little space he lay ;</l>
     <l n="843">Then grasped the hand he held , and sighed his soul away .</l>
     <l n="844">But whither went his soul , let such relate</l>
     <l n="845">Who search the secrets of the future state :</l>
     <l n="846">Divines can say but what themselves believe ;</l>
     <l n="847">Strong proofs they have , but not demonstrative ;</l>
     <l n="848">For , were all plain , then all sides must agree ,</l>
     <l n="849">And faith itself be lost in certainty .</l>
     <l n="850">To live uprightly , then , is sure the best ;</l>
     <l n="851">To save ourselves , and not to damn the rest .</l>
     <l n="852">The soul of Arcite went where heathens go ,</l>
     <l n="853">Who better live than we , though less they know .</l>
     <l n="854">In Palamon a manly grief appears ;</l>
     <l n="855">Silent he wept , ashamed to show his tears .</l>
     <l n="856">Emilia shrieked but once ; and then , oppressed</l>
     <l n="857">With sorrow , sunk upon her lover 's breast :</l>
     <l n="858">Till Theseus in his arms conveyed , with care ,</l>
     <l n="859">Far from so sad a sight , the swooning fair .</l>
     <l n="860">‘ Twere loss of time her sorrow to relate ; }</l>
     <l n="861">Ill bears the sex a youthful lover 's fate , }</l>
     <l n="862">When just approaching to the nuptial state : }</l>
     <l n="863">But , like a low-hung cloud , it rains so fast ,</l>
     <l n="864">That all at once it falls , and cannot last .</l>
     <l n="865">The face of things is changed , and Athens now ,</l>
     <l n="866">That laughed so late , becomes the scene of woe :</l>
     <l n="867">Matrons and maids , both sexes , every state ,</l>
     <l n="868">With tears lament the knight 's untimely fate .</l>
     <l n="869">Nor<span corresp="#note172" type="note_anchor">[ 172 ]</span>greater grief in falling Troy was seen</l>

     <l n="875">Theseus himself , who should have cheered the grief</l>
     <l n="876">Of others , wanted now the same relief :</l>
     <l n="877">Old Egeus only could revive his son ,</l>
     <l n="878">Who various changes of the world had known ,</l>
     <l n="879">And strange vicissitudes of human fate ,</l>
     <l n="880">Still altering , never in a steady state :</l>
     <l n="881">Good after ill , and , after pain , delight ,</l>
     <l n="882">Alternate , like the scenes of day and night .</l>
     <l n="883">Since every man , who lives , is born to die ,</l>
     <l n="884">And none can boast sincere felicity ,</l>
     <l n="885">With equal mind , what happens , let us bear ,</l>
     <l n="886">Nor joy , nor grieve too much , for things beyond our care .</l>
     <l n="887">Like pilgrims , to the appointed place we tend ;</l>
     <l n="888">The world 's an inn , and death the journey 's end .</l>
     <l n="889">Even kings but play ; and , when their part is done ,</l>
     <l n="890">Some other , worse or better , mount the throne .</l>
     <l n="891">With words like these the crowd was satisfied ,</l>
     <l n="892">And so they would have been had Theseus died .</l>
     <l n="893">But he , their king , was labouring in his mind , }</l>
     <l n="894">A fitting place for funeral pomps to find , }</l>
     <l n="895">Which were in honour of the dead designed . }</l>
     <l n="896">And , after long debate , at last he found</l>
     <l n="897">( As love itself had marked the spot of ground )</l>

     <l n="899">Where he with Palamon fought hand to hand ;</l>
     <l n="900">That , where he fed his amorous desires</l>
     <l n="901">With soft complaints , and felt his hottest fires ,</l>
     <l n="902">There other flames might waste his earthly part ,</l>
     <l n="903">And burn his limbs , where love had burned his heart .</l>
     <l n="904">This once resolved , the peasants were enjoined ,</l>
     <l n="905">Sere-wood , and firs , and doddered oaks to find .</l>

     <l n="917">Menaced his countenance , even in death severe .</l>
     <l n="918">Then to the palace-hall they bore the knight ,</l>

     <l n="937">The noblest of the Grecians next appear ,</l>
     <l n="938">And , weeping , on their shoulders bore the bier ;</l>

     <l n="943">The right side of the pall old Egeus kept ,</l>
     <l n="944">And on the left the royal Theseus wept ;</l>

     <l n="951">With high devotion was the service made ,</l>

     <l n="953">So lofty was the pile , a Parthian bow ,</l>
     <l n="954">With vigour drawn , must send the shaft below .</l>
     <l n="955">The bottom was full twenty fathom broad ,</l>
     <l n="956">With crackling straw beneath in due proportion strowed .</l>
     <l n="957">The fabric seemed a wood of rising green ,</l>
     <l n="958">With sulphur and bitumen cast between ,</l>
     <l n="959">To feed the flames ; the trees were unctuous fir , }</l>
     <l n="960">And mountain-ash , the mother of the spear ; }</l>
     <l n="961">The mourner-yew , and builder-oak , were there ; }</l>
     <l n="962">The beech , the swimming alder , and the plane , }</l>
     <l n="963">Hard box , and linden of a softer grain , }</l>
     <l n="964">And laurels , which the gods for conquering chiefs ordain . }</l>
     <l n="965">How they were ranked shall rest untold by me ,</l>

     <l n="973">The straw , as first I said , was laid below ;</l>
     <l n="974">Of chips , and sere-wood , was the second row ;</l>
     <l n="975">The third of greens , and timber newly felled ;</l>
     <l n="976">The fourth high stage the fragrant odours held ,</l>
     <l n="977">And pearls , and precious stones , and rich array ;</l>
     <l n="978">In midst of which , embalmed , the body lay .</l>
     <l n="979">The service sung , the maid , with mourning eyes ,</l>
     <l n="980">The stubble fired ; the smouldering flames arise :</l>
     <l n="981">This office done , she sunk upon the ground ;</l>
     <l n="982">But what she spoke , recovered from her swoon ,</l>
     <l n="983">I want the wit in moving words to dress ;</l>
     <l n="984">But , by themselves , the tender sex may guess .</l>
     <l n="985">While the devouring fire was burning fast ,</l>
     <l n="986">Rich jewels in the flame the wealthy cast ;</l>
     <l n="987">And some their shields , and some their lances threw ,</l>
     <l n="988">And gave the<span corresp="#note175" type="note_anchor">[ 175 ]</span>warrior 's ghost a warrior 's due .</l>
     <l n="989">Full bowls of wine , of honey , milk , and blood , }</l>
     <l n="990">Were poured upon the pile of burning wood ; }</l>
     <l n="991">And hissing flames receive , and , hungry , lick the food . }</l>
     <l n="992">Then thrice the mounted squadrons ride around</l>
     <l n="993">The fire , and Arcite 's name they thrice resound .</l>
     <l n="994">Hail and farewell ! they shouted thrice amain ,</l>
     <l n="995">Thrice facing to the left , and thrice they turned again :</l>
     <l n="996">Still , as they turned , they beat their clattering shields ;</l>
     <l n="997">The women mix their cries , and clamour fills the fields .</l>
     <l n="998">The warlike wakes continued all the night ,</l>
     <l n="999">And funeral-games were played at new-returning light :</l>
     <l n="1000">Who , naked , wrestled best , besmeared with oil ,</l>
     <l n="1001">Or who , with gauntlets , gave or took the foil ,</l>
     <l n="1002">I will not tell you , nor would you attend ;</l>
     <l n="1003">But briefly haste to my long story 's end .</l>
     <l n="1004">I pass the rest . The year was fully mourned ,</l>
     <l n="1005">And Palamon long since to Thebes returned .</l>
     <l n="1006">When , by the Grecians ’ general consent ,</l>
     <l n="1007">At Athens Theseus held his parliament ;</l>
     <l n="1008">Among the laws that passed , it was decreed ,</l>
     <l n="1009">That conquered Thebes from bondage should be freed ;</l>
     <l n="1010">Reserving homage to the Athenian throne ,</l>
     <l n="1011">To which the sovereign summoned Palamon .</l>
     <l n="1012">Unknowing of the cause , he took his way ,</l>
     <l n="1013">Mournful in mind , and still in black array .</l>
     <l n="1014">The monarch mounts the throne , and , placed on high ,</l>
     <l n="1015">Commands into the court the beauteous Emily .</l>
     <l n="1016">So called , she came ; the senate rose , and paid</l>
     <l n="1017">Becoming reverence to the royal maid .</l>
     <l n="1018">And first soft whispers through the assembly went ;</l>
     <l n="1019">With silent wonder then they watched the event :</l>
     <l n="1020">All hushed , the king arose with awful grace ,</l>
     <l n="1021">Deep thought was in his breast , and counsel in his face :</l>
     <l n="1022">At length he sighed , and , having first prepared</l>
     <l n="1023">The attentive audience , thus his will declared :—</l>
     <l n="1024">The Cause and Spring of motion , from above ,</l>
     <l n="1025">Hung down on earth , the golden chain of Love ;</l>
     <l n="1026">Great was the effect , and high was his intent ,</l>
     <l n="1027">When peace among the jarring seeds he sent :</l>
     <l n="1028">Fire , flood , and earth , and air , by this were bound ,</l>
     <l n="1029">And love , the common link , the new creation crowned .</l>
     <l n="1030">The chain still holds ; for , though the forms decay ,</l>
     <l n="1031">Eternal matter never wears away :</l>
     <l n="1032">The same first mover certain bounds has placed ,</l>
     <l n="1033">How long those perishable forms shall last ;</l>
     <l n="1034">Nor can they last beyond the time assigned</l>
     <l n="1035">By that all-seeing , and all-making Mind :</l>
     <l n="1036">Shorten their hours they may ; for will is free ;</l>
     <l n="1037">But never pass the appointed destiny .</l>
     <l n="1038">So men oppressed , when weary of their breath ,</l>
     <l n="1039">Throw off the burden , and suborn their death .</l>
     <l n="1040">Then , since those forms begin , and have their end ,</l>
     <l n="1041">On some unaltered cause they sure depend :</l>
     <l n="1042">Parts of the whole are we ; but God the whole ;</l>
     <l n="1043">Who gives us life , and animating soul .</l>
     <l n="1044">For nature cannot from a part derive</l>
     <l n="1045">That being , which the whole can only give :</l>
     <l n="1046">He , perfect , stable ; but imperfect we ,</l>
     <l n="1047">Subject to change , and different in degree ;</l>
     <l n="1048">Plants , beasts , and man ; and , as our organs are ,</l>
     <l n="1049">We , more or less , of his perfection share .</l>
     <l n="1050">But , by a long descent , the ethereal fire</l>
     <l n="1051">Corrupts ; and forms , the mortal part , expire .</l>
     <l n="1052">As he withdraws his virtue , so they pass ,</l>
     <l n="1053">And the same matter makes another mass .</l>
     <l n="1054">This law the Omniscient Power was pleased to give ,</l>
     <l n="1055">That every kind should by succession live ;</l>
     <l n="1056">That individuals die , his will ordains ;</l>
     <l n="1057">The propagated species still remains .</l>
     <l n="1058">The monarch oak , the patriarch of the trees ,</l>
     <l n="1059">Shoots rising up , and spreads by slow degrees ;</l>
     <l n="1060">Three centuries he grows , and three he stays ,</l>
     <l n="1061">Supreme in state , and in three more decays :</l>
     <l n="1062">So wears the paving pebble in the street ,</l>
     <l n="1063">And towns and towers their fatal periods meet :</l>
     <l n="1064">So rivers , rapid once , now naked lie ,</l>
     <l n="1065">Forsaken of their springs , and leave their channels dry :</l>
     <l n="1066">So man , at first a drop , dilates with heat ,</l>
     <l n="1067">Then formed , the little heart begins to beat ;</l>
     <l n="1068">Secret he feeds , unknowing in the cell ;</l>
     <l n="1069">At length , for hatching ripe , he breaks the shell ,</l>
     <l n="1070">And struggles into breath , and cries for aid ;</l>
     <l n="1071">Then , helpless , in his mother 's lap is laid .</l>
     <l n="1072">He creeps , he walks , and , issuing into man ,</l>
     <l n="1073">Grudges their life , from whence his own began ;</l>
     <l n="1074">Retchless of laws , affects to rule alone ,</l>
     <l n="1075">Anxious to reign , and restless on the throne ;</l>
     <l n="1076">First vegetive , then feels , and reasons last ;</l>
     <l n="1077">Rich of three souls , and lives all three to waste .</l>
     <l n="1078">Some thus , but thousands more in flower of age ;</l>
     <l n="1079">For few arrive to run the latter stage .</l>
     <l n="1080">Sunk in the first , in battle some are slain ,</l>
     <l n="1081">And others whelmed beneath the stormy main .</l>
     <l n="1082">What makes all this , but Jupiter the king ,</l>
     <l n="1083">At whose command we perish , and we spring ?</l>
     <l n="1084">Then ‘ tis our best , since thus ordained to die ,</l>
     <l n="1085">To make a virtue of necessity ;</l>
     <l n="1086">Take what he gives , since to rebel is vain ;</l>
     <l n="1087">The bad grows better , which we well sustain ;</l>
     <l n="1088">And could we chuse the time , and chuse aright ,</l>
     <l n="1089">‘ Tis best to die , our honour at the height .</l>
     <l n="1090">When we have done our ancestors no shame ,</l>
     <l n="1091">But served our friends , and well secured our fame ;</l>
     <l n="1092">Then should we wish our happy life to close ,</l>
     <l n="1093">And leave no more for fortune to dispose .</l>
     <l n="1094">So should we make our death a glad relief</l>
     <l n="1095">From future shame , from sickness , and from grief ;</l>
     <l n="1096">Enjoying , while we live , the present hour ,</l>
     <l n="1097">And dying in our excellence and flower .</l>
     <l n="1098">Then round our death-bed every friend should run ,</l>
     <l n="1099">And joyous of our conquest early won ;</l>
     <l n="1100">While the malicious world , with envious tears ,</l>
     <l n="1101">Should grudge our happy end , and wish it theirs .</l>
     <l n="1102">Since then our Arcite is with honour dead , }</l>
     <l n="1103">Why should we mourn , that he so soon is freed , }</l>
     <l n="1104">Or call untimely , what the gods decreed ? }</l>
     <l n="1105">With grief as just , a friend may be deplored ,</l>
     <l n="1106">From a foul prison to free air restored .</l>
     <l n="1107">Ought he to thank his kinsman or his wife ,</l>
     <l n="1108">Could tears recal him into wretched life ?</l>
     <l n="1109">Their sorrow hurts themselves ; on him is lost ;</l>
     <l n="1110">And , worse than both , offends his happy ghost .</l>
     <l n="1111">What then remains , but , after past annoy ,</l>
     <l n="1112">To take the good vicissitude of joy ;</l>
     <l n="1113">To thank the gracious gods for what they give ,</l>
     <l n="1114">Possess our souls , and while we live , to live ?</l>
     <l n="1115">Ordain we then two sorrows to combine ,</l>
     <l n="1116">And in one point the extremes of grief to join ;</l>
     <l n="1117">That thence resulting joy may be renewed ,</l>
     <l n="1118">As jarring notes in harmony conclude .</l>
     <l n="1119">Then I propose , that Palamon shall be</l>
     <l n="1120">In marriage joined with beauteous Emily ;</l>
     <l n="1121">For which already I have gained the assent</l>
     <l n="1122">Of my free people in full parliament .</l>
     <l n="1123">Long love to her has borne the faithful knight ,</l>
     <l n="1124">And well deserved , had fortune done him right :</l>
     <l n="1125">‘ Tis time to mend her fault , since Emily ,</l>
     <l n="1126">By Arcite 's death , from former vows is free ;</l>
     <l n="1127">If you , fair sister , ratify the accord ,</l>
     <l n="1128">And take him for your husband and your lord .</l>
     <l n="1129">‘ Tis no dishonour to confer your grace</l>
     <l n="1130">On one descended from a royal race ;</l>
     <l n="1131">And were he less , yet years of service past ,</l>
     <l n="1132">From grateful souls , exact reward at last .</l>
     <l n="1133">Pity is heaven 's and your 's ; nor can she find</l>
     <l n="1134">A throne so soft as in a woman 's mind .—</l>
     <l n="1135">He said : she blushed ; and , as o'erawed by might ,</l>
     <l n="1136">Seemed to give Theseus what she gave the knight .</l>
     <l n="1137">Then , turning to the Theban , thus he said :—</l>
     <l n="1138">Small arguments are needful to persuade</l>
     <l n="1139">Your temper to comply with my command :—</l>
     <l n="1140">And , speaking thus , he gave Emilia 's hand .</l>
     <l n="1141">Smiled Venus , to behold her own true knight }</l>
     <l n="1142">Obtain the conquest , though he lost the fight ; }</l>
     <l n="1143">And blessed , with nuptial bliss , the sweet laborious night . }</l>
     <l n="1144">Eros and Anteros , on either side ,</l>
     <l n="1145">One fired the bridegroom , and one warmed the bride ;</l>
     <l n="1146">And long-attending Hymen , from above ,</l>
     <l n="1147">Showered on the bed the whole Idalian grove .</l>
     <l n="1148">All of a tenor was their after-life ,</l>
     <l n="1149">No day discoloured with domestic strife ;</l>
     <l n="1150">No jealousy , but mutual truth believed ,</l>
     <l n="1151">Secure repose , and kindness undeceived .</l>
     <l n="1152">Thus heaven , beyond the compass of his thought ,</l>
     <l n="1153">Sent him the blessing he so dearly bought .</l>
     <l n="1154">So may the Queen of Love long duty bless ,</l>
     <l n="1155">And all true lovers find the same success !</l>

   <p>THE</p>
   <p>COCK AND THE FOX .</p>
   <p>The accurate Tyrwhitt detected the original of this fable in the translation of “ Æsop , ” made by Marie of France into Norman-French for the amusement of the court of England , by which that language was used down to the reign of Edward . But the hand of genius gilds what it touches ; and the naked Apologue , which may be found in Tyrwhitt 's “ Preliminary Discourse , ” was amplified by Chaucer into a poem , which , in grave , ironical narrative , liveliness of illustration , and happiness of humorous description , yields to none that ever was written . Dryden , whom “ The Hind and Panther ” had familiarized with this species of composition , has executed a version at once literal and spirited , which seldom omits what is valuable in his original , and often adds those sparks which genius strikes out , when in collision with the work of a kindred spirit .</p>

    <head>THE</head>
    <head>COCK AND THE FOX ;</head>
    <head>OR , THE</head>
    <head>TALE OF THE NUN 'S PRIEST .</head>
     <l n="1">There lived , as authors tell , in days of yore ,</l>
     <l n="2">A widow , somewhat old , and very poor ;</l>
     <l n="3">Deep in a cell her cottage lonely stood ,</l>
     <l n="4">Well thatched , and under covert of a wood .</l>
     <l n="5">This dowager , on whom my tale I found ,</l>
     <l n="6">Since last she laid her husband in the ground ,</l>
     <l n="7">A simple sober life in patience led ,</l>
     <l n="8">And had but just enough to buy her bread ;</l>
     <l n="9">But housewifing the little heaven had lent ,</l>
     <l n="10">She duly paid a groat for quarter rent ;</l>
     <l n="11">And pinched her belly , with her daughters two ,</l>
     <l n="12">To bring the year about with much ado .</l>
     <l n="13">The cattle in her homestead were three sows ,</l>
     <l n="14">An ewe called Mally , and three brinded cows .</l>
     <l n="15">Her parlour-window stuck with herbs around ,</l>
     <l n="16">Of savoury smell , and rushes strewed the ground .</l>
     <l n="17">A maple dresser in her hall she had ,</l>
     <l n="18">On which full many a slender meal she made :</l>
     <l n="19">For no delicious morsel passed her throat ;</l>
     <l n="20">According to her cloth she cut her coat .</l>
     <l n="21">No poignant sauce she knew , no costly treat ,</l>
     <l n="22">Her hunger gave a relish to her meat .</l>
     <l n="23">A sparing diet did her health assure ;</l>
     <l n="24">Or sick , a pepper posset was her cure .</l>
     <l n="25">Before the day was done , her work she sped ,</l>
     <l n="26">And never went by candle-light to bed .</l>
     <l n="27">With exercise she sweat ill humours out ;</l>
     <l n="28">Her dancing was not hindered by the gout .</l>
     <l n="29">Her poverty was glad , her heart content ,</l>
     <l n="30">Nor knew she what the spleen or vapours meant .</l>
     <l n="31">Of wine she never tasted through the year ,</l>
     <l n="32">But white and black was all her homely cheer ;</l>
     <l n="33">Brown bread and milk , ( but first she skimmed her bowls ,)</l>
     <l n="34">And rashers of singed bacon on the coals ;</l>
     <l n="35">On holidays an egg , or two at most ;</l>
     <l n="36">But her ambition never reached to roast .</l>
     <l n="37">A yard she had , with pales enclosed about ,</l>
     <l n="38">Some high , some low , and a dry ditch without .</l>
     <l n="39">Within this homestead lived , without a peer ,</l>
     <l n="40">For crowing loud , the noble Chanticleer ;</l>
     <l n="41">So hight her cock , whose singing did surpass</l>
     <l n="42">The merry notes of organs at the mass .</l>
     <l n="43">More certain was the crowing of the cock</l>
     <l n="44">To number hours , than is an abbey-clock ;</l>
     <l n="45">And sooner than the mattin-bell was rung ,</l>
     <l n="46">He clapped his wings upon his roost , and sung :</l>
     <l n="47">For when degrees fifteen ascended right ,</l>
     <l n="48">By sure instinct he knew ‘ twas one at night .</l>
     <l n="49">High was his comb , and coral-red withal ,</l>
     <l n="50">In dents embattled like a castle wall ;</l>
     <l n="51">His bill was raven-black , and shone like jet ;</l>
     <l n="52">Blue were his legs , and orient were his feet ;</l>
     <l n="53">White were his nails , like silver to behold ,</l>
     <l n="54">His body glittering like the burnished gold .</l>
     <l n="55">This gentle cock , for solace of his life ,</l>
     <l n="56">Six misses had , beside his lawful wife ;</l>
     <l n="57">Scandal , that spares no king , though ne'er so good ,</l>
     <l n="58">Says , they were all of his own flesh and blood ;</l>
     <l n="59">His sisters , both by sire and mother 's side ,</l>
     <l n="60">And sure their likeness shewed them near allied .</l>
     <l n="61">But make the worst , the monarch did no more ,</l>
     <l n="62">Than all the Ptolemys had done before :</l>
     <l n="63">When incest is for interest of a nation ,</l>
     <l n="64">‘ Tis made no sin by holy dispensation .</l>
     <l n="65">Some lines have been maintained by this alone ,</l>
     <l n="66">Which by their common ugliness are known .</l>
     <l n="67">But passing this as from our tale apart ,</l>
     <l n="68">Dame Partlet<span corresp="#note176" type="note_anchor">[ 176 ]</span>was the sovereign of his heart :</l>
     <l n="69">Ardent in love , outrageous in his play ,</l>
     <l n="70">He feathered her a hundred times a day ;</l>
     <l n="71">And she , that was not only passing fair ,</l>
     <l n="72">But was withal discreet , and debonair ,</l>
     <l n="73">Resolved the passive doctrine to fulfil ,</l>
     <l n="74">Though loth , and let him work his wicked will :</l>
     <l n="75">At board and bed was affable and kind , }</l>
     <l n="76">According as their marriage-vow did bind , }</l>
     <l n="77">And as the church 's precept had enjoined . }</l>
     <l n="78">Even since she was a se'nnight old , they say , }</l>
     <l n="79">Was chaste and humble to her dying day , }</l>
     <l n="80">Nor chick nor hen was known to disobey . }</l>
     <l n="81">By this her husband 's heart she did obtain ;</l>
     <l n="82">What cannot beauty , joined with virtue , gain !</l>
     <l n="83">She was his only joy , and he her pride ,</l>
     <l n="84">She , when he walked , went pecking by his side ;</l>
     <l n="85">If , spurning up the ground , he sprung a corn ,</l>
     <l n="86">The tribute in his bill to her was borne .</l>
     <l n="87">But oh ! what joy it was to hear him sing</l>
     <l n="88">In summer , when the day began to spring ,</l>
     <l n="89">Stretching his neck , and warbling in his throat ,</l>
     <l n="90">Solus cum sola , then was all his note .</l>
     <l n="91">For in the days of yore , the birds of parts</l>
     <l n="92">Were bred to speak , and sing , and learn the liberal arts .</l>
     <l n="93">It happ 'd that perching on the parlour-beam ,</l>
     <l n="94">Amidst his wives , he had a deadly dream ,</l>
     <l n="95">Just at the dawn ; and sighed , and groaned so fast ,</l>
     <l n="96">As every breath he drew would be his last .</l>
     <l n="97">Dame Partlet , ever nearest to his side ,</l>
     <l n="98">Heard all his piteous moan , and how he cried</l>
     <l n="99">For help from Gods and men ; and sore aghast</l>
     <l n="100">She pecked and pulled , and wakened him at last .</l>
     <l n="101">Dear heart , said she , for love of heaven declare</l>
     <l n="102">Your pain , and make me partner of your care .</l>
     <l n="103">You groan , Sir , ever since the morning-light ,</l>
     <l n="104">As something had disturbed your noble sprite .—</l>
     <l n="105">And , madam , well I might , said Chanticleer ,</l>
     <l n="106">Never was shrovetide-cock in such a fear .</l>
     <l n="107">Even still I run all over in a sweat ,</l>
     <l n="108">My princely senses not recovered yet .</l>
     <l n="109">For such a dream I had of dire portent ,</l>
     <l n="110">That much I fear my body will be shent :</l>
     <l n="111">It bodes I shall have wars and woeful strife ,</l>
     <l n="112">Or in a loathsome dungeon end my life .</l>
     <l n="113">Know , dame , I dreamt within my troubled breast , }</l>
     <l n="114">That in our yard I saw a murderous beast , }</l>
     <l n="115">That on my body would have made arrest . }</l>
     <l n="116">With waking eyes I ne'er beheld his fellow ;</l>
     <l n="117">His colour was betwixt a red and yellow :</l>
     <l n="118">Tipped was his tail , and both his pricking ears ,</l>
     <l n="119">With black , and much unlike his other hairs :</l>
     <l n="120">The rest , in shape a beagle 's whelp throughout ,</l>
     <l n="121">With broader forehead , and a sharper snout :</l>
     <l n="122">Deep in his front were sunk his glowing eyes ,</l>
     <l n="123">That yet , methinks , I see him with surprise .</l>
     <l n="124">Reach out your hand , I drop with clammy sweat ,</l>
     <l n="125">And lay it to my heart , and feel it beat .—</l>
     <l n="126">Now fie for shame ! quoth she ; by heaven above ,</l>
     <l n="127">Thou hast for ever lost thy lady 's love .</l>
     <l n="128">No woman can endure a recreant knight ;</l>
     <l n="129">He must be bold by day , and free by night :</l>
     <l n="130">Our sex desires a husband or a friend ,</l>
     <l n="131">Who can our honour and his own defend ;</l>
     <l n="132">Wise , hardy , secret , liberal of his purse ;</l>
     <l n="133">A fool is nauseous , but a coward worse :</l>
     <l n="134">No bragging coxcomb , yet no baffled knight ,</l>
     <l n="135">How dar'st thou talk of love , and dar'st not fight ?</l>
     <l n="136">How dar'st thou tell thy dame thou art affeared ?</l>
     <l n="137">Hast thou no manly heart , and hast a beard ?</l>
     <l n="138">If aught from fearful dreams may be divined ,</l>
     <l n="139">They signify a cock of dunghill kind .</l>
     <l n="140">All dreams , as in old Galen I have read ,</l>
     <l n="141">Are from repletion and complexion bred ;</l>
     <l n="142">From rising fumes of indigested food ,</l>
     <l n="143">And noxious humours that infect the blood :</l>
     <l n="144">And sure , my lord , if I can read aright ,</l>
     <l n="145">These foolish fancies , you have had to-night ,</l>
     <l n="146">Are certain symptoms ( in the canting style )</l>
     <l n="147">Of boiling choler , and abounding bile ;</l>
     <l n="148">This yellow gall , that in your stomach floats ,</l>
     <l n="149">Engenders all these visionary thoughts .</l>
     <l n="150">When choler overflows , then dreams are bred</l>
     <l n="151">Of flames , and all the family of red ;</l>
     <l n="152">Red dragons , and red beasts , in sleep we view ,</l>
     <l n="153">For humours are distinguished by their hue .</l>
     <l n="154">From hence we dream of wars and warlike things ,</l>
     <l n="155">And wasps and hornets with their double wings .</l>
     <l n="156">Choler adust congeals our blood with fear ,</l>
     <l n="157">Then black bulls toss us , and black devils tear .</l>
     <l n="158">In sanguine airy dreams aloft we bound ;</l>
     <l n="159">With rheums oppressed , we sink in rivers drowned .</l>
     <l n="160">More I could say , but thus conclude my theme ,</l>
     <l n="161">The dominating humour makes the dream .</l>
     <l n="162">Cato was in his time accounted wise ,</l>
     <l n="163">And he condemns them all for empty lies .<span corresp="#note177" type="note_anchor">[ 177 ]</span></l>
     <l n="164">Take my advice , and when we fly to ground , }</l>
     <l n="165">With laxatives preserve your body sound , }</l>
     <l n="166">And purge the peccant humours that abound . }</l>
     <l n="167">I should be loth to lay you on a bier ;</l>
     <l n="168">And though there lives no ‘ pothecary near ,</l>
     <l n="169">I dare for once prescribe for your disease ,</l>
     <l n="170">And save long bills , and a damned doctor 's fees .</l>
     <l n="171">Two sovereign herbs , which I by practice know ,</l>
     <l n="172">And both at hand , ( for in our yard they grow ,)</l>
     <l n="173">On peril of my soul shall rid you wholly</l>
     <l n="174">Of yellow choler , and of melancholy :</l>
     <l n="175">You must both purge and vomit ; but obey ,</l>
     <l n="176">And for the love of heaven make no delay .</l>
     <l n="177">Since hot and dry in your complexion join ,</l>
     <l n="178">Beware the sun when in a vernal sign ;</l>
     <l n="179">For when he mounts exalted in the Ram ,</l>
     <l n="180">If then he finds your body in a flame ,</l>
     <l n="181">Replete with choler , I dare lay a groat ,</l>
     <l n="182">A tertian ague is at least your lot .</l>
     <l n="183">Perhaps a fever ( which the Gods forefend )</l>
     <l n="184">May bring your youth to some untimely end :</l>
     <l n="185">And therefore , sir , as you desire to live ,</l>
     <l n="186">A day or two before your laxative ,</l>
     <l n="187">Take just three worms , nor under nor above ,</l>
     <l n="188">Because the Gods unequal numbers love .</l>
     <l n="189">These digestives prepare you for your purge ;</l>
     <l n="190">Of fumetery , centaury , and spurge ,</l>
     <l n="191">And of ground-ivy add a leaf , or two ,</l>
     <l n="192">All which within our yard or garden grow .</l>
     <l n="193">Eat these , and be , my lord , of better cheer ;</l>
     <l n="194">Your father 's son was never born to fear .—</l>
     <l n="195">Madam , quoth he , gramercy for your care ,</l>
     <l n="196">But Cato , whom you quoted , you may spare .</l>
     <l n="197">‘ Tis true , a wise and worthy man he seems ,</l>
     <l n="198">And ( as you say ) gave no belief to dreams ;</l>
     <l n="199">But other men of more authority ,</l>
     <l n="200">And , by the immortal powers , as wise as he ,</l>
     <l n="201">Maintain , with sounder sense , that dreams forebode ;</l>
     <l n="202">For Homer plainly says they come from God .</l>
     <l n="203">Nor Cato said it ; but some modern fool</l>
     <l n="204">Imposed in Cato 's name on boys at school .</l>
     <l n="205">Believe me , madam , morning dreams foreshow</l>
     <l n="206">The events of things , and future weal or woe :</l>
     <l n="207">Some truths are not by reason to be tried ,</l>
     <l n="208">But we have sure experience for our guide .</l>
     <l n="209">An ancient author ,<span corresp="#note178" type="note_anchor">[ 178 ]</span>equal with the best ,</l>
     <l n="210">Relates this tale of dreams among the rest .</l>
     <l n="211">Two friends or brothers , with devout intent ,</l>
     <l n="212">On some far pilgrimage together went .</l>
     <l n="213">It happened so , that , when the sun was down ,</l>
     <l n="214">They just arrived by twilight at a town ;</l>
     <l n="215">That day had been the baiting of a bull ,</l>
     <l n="216">‘ Twas at a feast , and every inn so full ,</l>
     <l n="217">That no void room in chamber , or on ground ,</l>
     <l n="218">And but one sorry bed was to be found ;</l>
     <l n="219">And that so little it would hold but one ,</l>
     <l n="220">Though till this hour they never lay alone .</l>
     <l n="221">So were they forced to part ; one staid behind ,</l>
     <l n="222">His fellow sought what lodging he could find :</l>
     <l n="223">At last he found a stall where oxen stood ,</l>
     <l n="224">And that he rather chose than lie abroad .</l>
     <l n="225">‘ Twas in a farther yard without a door ;</l>
     <l n="226">But , for his ease , well littered was the floor .</l>
     <l n="227">His fellow , who the narrow bed had kept ,</l>
     <l n="228">Was weary , and without a rocker slept :</l>
     <l n="229">Supine he snored ; but in the dead of night ,</l>
     <l n="230">He dreamt his friend appeared before his sight ,</l>
     <l n="231">Who , with a ghastly look and doleful cry ,</l>
     <l n="232">Said , help me , brother , or this night I die :</l>
     <l n="233">Arise , and help , before all help be vain ,</l>
     <l n="234">Or in an ox 's stall I shall be slain .</l>
     <l n="235">Rouzed from his rest , he wakened in a start ,</l>
     <l n="236">Shivering with horror , and with aching heart ;</l>
     <l n="237">At length to cure himself by reason tries ; }</l>
     <l n="238">‘ Twas but a dream , and what are dreams but lies ? }</l>
     <l n="239">So thinking changed his side , and closed his eyes . }</l>
     <l n="240">His dream returns ; his friend appears again : }</l>
     <l n="241">The murderers come , now help , or I am slain :— }</l>
     <l n="242">‘ Twas but a vision still , and visions are but vain . }</l>
     <l n="243">He dreamt the third ; but now his friend appeared</l>
     <l n="244">Pale , naked , pierced with wounds , with blood besmeared :</l>
     <l n="245">Thrice warned , awake , said he ; relief is late ,</l>
     <l n="246">The deed is done ; but thou revenge my fate :</l>
     <l n="247">Tardy of aid , unseal thy heavy eyes ,</l>
     <l n="248">Awake , and with the dawning day arise :</l>
     <l n="249">Take to the western gate thy ready way ,</l>
     <l n="250">For by that passage they my corpse convey :</l>
     <l n="251">My corpse is in a tumbrel laid , among</l>
     <l n="252">The filth , and ordure , and inclosed with dung .</l>
     <l n="253">That cart arrest , and raise a common cry ;</l>
     <l n="254">For sacred hunger of my gold I die :—</l>
     <l n="255">Then shewed his grisly wounds ; and last he drew</l>
     <l n="256">A piteous sigh , and took a long adieu .</l>
     <l n="257">The frighted friend arose by break of day ,</l>
     <l n="258">And found the stall where late his fellow lay .</l>
     <l n="259">Then of his impious host inquiring more ,</l>
     <l n="260">Was answered that his guest was gone before :</l>
     <l n="261">Muttering he went , said he , by morning light ,</l>
     <l n="262">And much complained of his ill rest by night .</l>
     <l n="263">This raised suspicion in the pilgrim 's mind ; }</l>
     <l n="264">Because all hosts are of an evil kind , }</l>
     <l n="265">And oft to share the spoil with robbers joined . }</l>
     <l n="266">His dream confirmed his thought ; with troubled look</l>
     <l n="267">Straight to the western gate his way he took ;</l>
     <l n="268">There , as his dream foretold , a cart he found ,</l>
     <l n="269">That carried compost forth to dung the ground .</l>
     <l n="270">This when the pilgrim saw , he stretched his throat ,</l>
     <l n="271">And cried out murder with a yelling note .</l>
     <l n="272">My murdered fellow in this cart lies dead ;</l>
     <l n="273">Vengeance and justice on the villain 's head !</l>
     <l n="274">You , magistrates , who sacred laws dispense ,</l>
     <l n="275">On you I call to punish this offence .—</l>
     <l n="276">The word thus given , within a little space ,</l>
     <l n="277">The mob came roaring out , and thronged the place .</l>
     <l n="278">All in a trice they cast the cart to ground , }</l>
     <l n="279">And in the dung the murdered body found ; }</l>
     <l n="280">Though breathless , warm , and reeking from the wound . }</l>
     <l n="281">Good heaven , whose darling attribute we find</l>
     <l n="282">Is boundless grace , and mercy to mankind ,</l>
     <l n="283">Abhors the cruel ; and the deeds of night</l>
     <l n="284">By wondrous ways reveals in open light :</l>
     <l n="285">Murder may pass unpunished for a time ,</l>
     <l n="286">But tardy justice will o'ertake the crime .</l>
     <l n="287">And oft a speedier pain the guilty feels ,</l>
     <l n="288">The hue and cry of heaven pursues him at the heels ,</l>
     <l n="289">Fresh from the fact , as in the present case : }</l>
     <l n="290">The criminals are seized upon the place ; }</l>
     <l n="291">Carter and host confronted face to face . }</l>
     <l n="292">Stiff in denial , as the law appoints ,</l>
     <l n="293">On engines they distend their tortured joints ;</l>
     <l n="294">So was confession forced , the offence was known ,</l>
     <l n="295">And public justice on the offenders done .</l>
     <l n="296">Here may you see that visions are to dread ;</l>
     <l n="297">And in the page that follows this , I read</l>
     <l n="298">Of two young merchants , whom the hope of gain</l>
     <l n="299">Induced in partnership to cross the main ;</l>
     <l n="300">Waiting till willing winds their sails supplied , }</l>
     <l n="301">Within a trading-town they long abide , }</l>
     <l n="302">Full fairly situate on a haven 's side . }</l>
     <l n="303">One evening it befel , that , looking out ,</l>
     <l n="304">The wind they long had wished was come about ;</l>
     <l n="305">Well pleased they went to rest ; and if the gale</l>
     <l n="306">Till morn continued , both resolved to sail .</l>
     <l n="307">But as together in a bed they lay ,</l>
     <l n="308">The younger had a dream at break of day .</l>
     <l n="309">A man , he thought , stood frowning at his side , }</l>
     <l n="310">Who warned him for his safety to provide , }</l>
     <l n="311">Nor put to sea , but safe on shore abide . }</l>
     <l n="312">I come , thy genius , to command thy stay ; }</l>
     <l n="313">Trust not the winds , for fatal is the day , }</l>
     <l n="314">And death unhoped<span corresp="#note179" type="note_anchor">[ 179 ]</span>attends the watry way . }</l>
     <l n="315">The vision said , and vanished from his sight .</l>
     <l n="316">The dreamer wakened in a mortal fright ;</l>
     <l n="317">Then pulled his drowsy neighbour , and declared ,</l>
     <l n="318">What in his slumber he had seen and heard .</l>
     <l n="319">His friend smiled scornful , and , with proud contempt ,</l>
     <l n="320">Rejects as idle what his fellow dreamt .</l>
     <l n="321">Stay , who will stay ; for me no fears restrain ,</l>
     <l n="322">Who follow Mercury , the god of gain ;</l>
     <l n="323">Let each man do as to his fancy seems ,</l>
     <l n="324">I wait not , I , till you have better dreams .</l>
     <l n="325">Dreams are but interludes , which fancy makes ;</l>
     <l n="326">When monarch reason sleeps , this mimic wakes ;</l>
     <l n="327">Compounds a medley of disjointed things ,</l>
     <l n="328">A mob of coblers , and a court of kings :[ 180 ]</l>
     <l n="329">Light fumes are merry , grosser fumes are sad ;</l>
     <l n="330">Both are the reasonable soul run mad ;</l>
     <l n="331">And many monstrous forms in sleep we see ,</l>
     <l n="332">That neither were , nor are , nor e'er can be .</l>
     <l n="333">Sometimes , forgotten things long cast behind</l>
     <l n="334">Rush forward in the brain , and come to mind .</l>
     <l n="335">The nurse 's legends are for truths received ,</l>
     <l n="336">And the man dreams but what the boy believed .</l>
     <l n="337">Sometimes we but rehearse a former play , }</l>
     <l n="338">The night restores our actions done by day , }</l>
     <l n="339">As hounds in sleep will open for their prey . }</l>
     <l n="340">In short , the farce of dreams is of a piece ,</l>
     <l n="341">Chimeras all ; and more absurd , or less .</l>
     <l n="342">You , who believe in tales , abide alone ;</l>
     <l n="343">Whate'er I get this voyage is my own .—</l>
     <l n="344">Thus while he spoke , he heard the shouting crew</l>
     <l n="345">That called aboard , and took his last adieu .</l>
     <l n="346">The vessel went before a merry gale ,</l>
     <l n="347">And for quick passage put on every sail ;</l>
     <l n="348">But when least feared , and even in open day ,</l>
     <l n="349">The mischief overtook her in the way :</l>
     <l n="350">Whether she sprung a leak , I cannot find ,</l>
     <l n="351">Or whether she was overset with wind ,</l>
     <l n="352">Or that some rock below her bottom rent ,</l>
     <l n="353">But down at once with all the crew she went .</l>
     <l n="354">Her fellow-ships from far her loss descried ;</l>
     <l n="355">But only she was sunk , and all were safe beside .</l>
     <l n="356">By this example you are taught again ,</l>
     <l n="357">That dreams and visions are not always vain ;</l>

     <l n="359">Another tale shall make the former out .</l>
     <l n="360">Kenelm , the son of Kenulph , Mercia 's king ,<span corresp="#note181" type="note_anchor">[ 181 ]</span></l>
     <l n="361">Whose holy life the legends loudly sing ,</l>
     <l n="362">Warned in a dream , his murder did foretel ,</l>
     <l n="363">From point to point as after it befel :</l>
     <l n="364">All circumstances to his nurse he told ,</l>
     <l n="365">( A wonder from a child of seven years old ;)</l>
     <l n="366">The dream with horror heard , the good old wife</l>
     <l n="367">From treason counselled him to guard his life ;</l>
     <l n="368">But close to keep the secret in his mind ,</l>
     <l n="369">For a boy 's vision small belief would find .</l>
     <l n="370">The pious child , by promise bound , obeyed ,</l>
     <l n="371">Nor was the fatal murder long delayed ;</l>
     <l n="372">By Quenda slain , he fell before his time ,</l>
     <l n="373">Made a young martyr by his sister 's crime .</l>
     <l n="374">The tale is told by venerable Bede ,</l>
     <l n="375">Which , at your better leisure , you may read .</l>
     <l n="376">Macrobius too relates the vision sent</l>
     <l n="377">To the great Scipio , with the famed event ;</l>
     <l n="378">Objections makes , but after makes replies ,</l>
     <l n="379">And adds , that dreams are often prophecies .</l>

     <l n="390">Raised in his vision on a lofty tree ?</l>
     <l n="391">The wife of Hector , in his utmost pride ,</l>
     <l n="392">Dreamt of his death the night before he died :[ 182 ]</l>
     <l n="393">Well was he warned from battle to refrain , }</l>
     <l n="394">But men to death decreed are warned in vain ; }</l>

     <l n="398">Let this suffice , that plainly I foresee</l>
     <l n="399">My dream was bad , and bodes adversity ;</l>
     <l n="400">But neither pills nor laxatives I like ,</l>
     <l n="401">They only serve to make a well-man sick ;</l>
     <l n="402">Of these his gain the sharp physician makes ,</l>

     <l n="404">They not correct , but poison all the blood ,</l>

     <l n="419">Madam , the meaning of this Latin is ,</l>
     <l n="420">That woman is to man his sovereign bliss .</l>
     <l n="421">For when by night I feel your tender side ,</l>
     <l n="422">Though for the narrow perch I cannot ride ,</l>
     <l n="423">Yet I have such a solace in my mind ,</l>
     <l n="424">That all my boding cares are cast behind ,</l>
     <l n="425">And even already I forget my dream .—</l>
     <l n="426">He said , and downward flew from off the beam ,</l>
     <l n="427">For day light now began apace to spring ,</l>
     <l n="428">The thrush to whistle , and the lark to sing .</l>
     <l n="429">Then crowing , clapped his wings , the appointed call ,</l>
     <l n="430">To chuck his wives together in the hall .</l>
     <l n="431">By this the widow had unbarred the door ,</l>
     <l n="432">And Chanticleer went strutting out before ,</l>
     <l n="433">With royal courage , and with heart so light ,</l>
     <l n="434">As shewed he scorned the visions of the night .</l>
     <l n="435">Now roaming in the yard , he spurned the ground ,</l>
     <l n="436">And gave to Partlet the first grain he found .</l>
     <l n="437">Then often feathered her with wanton play ,</l>
     <l n="438">And trod her twenty times ere prime of day ;</l>
     <l n="439">And took by turns and gave so much delight ,</l>
     <l n="440">Her sisters pined with envy at the sight .</l>
     <l n="441">He chucked again , when other corns he found ,</l>
     <l n="442">And scarcely deigned to set a foot to ground ;</l>
     <l n="443">But swaggered like a lord about his hall ,</l>
     <l n="444">And his seven wives came running at his call .</l>
     <l n="445">‘ Twas now the month in which the world began ,</l>
     <l n="446">( If March beheld the first created man ;)</l>
     <l n="447">And since the vernal equinox , the sun</l>

     <l n="449">When casting up his eyes against the light ,</l>
     <l n="450">Both month , and day , and hour , he measured right ,</l>

     <l n="453">Thus numbering times and seasons in his breast ,</l>
     <l n="454">His second crowing the third hour confessed .</l>
     <l n="455">Then turning , said to Partlet ,— See , my dear ,</l>
     <l n="456">How lavish nature has adorned the year ;</l>
     <l n="457">How the pale primrose and blue violet spring ,</l>
     <l n="458">And birds essay their throats disused to sing :</l>
     <l n="459">All these are ours ; and I with pleasure see ,</l>
     <l n="460">Man strutting on two legs , and aping me ;</l>
     <l n="461">An unfledged creature , of a lumpish frame ,</l>
     <l n="462">Endued with fewer particles of flame :</l>
     <l n="463">Our dame sits cowering o'er a kitchen fire ,</l>

     <l n="466">Than , since I was an egg , I ever found .—</l>
     <l n="467">The time shall come , when Chanticleer shall wish</l>
     <l n="468">His words unsaid , and hate his boasted bliss ;</l>
     <l n="469">The crested bird shall by experience know , }</l>
     <l n="470">Jove made not him his masterpiece below , }</l>
     <l n="471">And learn the latter end of joy is woe . }</l>
     <l n="472">The vessel of his bliss to dregs is run ,</l>

     <l n="474">Ye wise ! draw near and hearken to my tale ,</l>

     <l n="491">The plot contrived , before the break of day ,</l>
     <l n="492">Saint Reynard through the hedge had made his way ;</l>

     <l n="494">He leapt the fence of the forbidden ground ;</l>
     <l n="495">Yet fearing to be seen , within a bed</l>
     <l n="496">Of coleworts he concealed his wily head ;</l>

     <l n="500">O traitor , worse than Sinon was to Troy !</l>
     <l n="501">O vile subverter of the Gallic reign ,</l>
     <l n="502">More false than Gano was to Charlemaign !<span corresp="#note186" type="note_anchor">[ 186 ]</span></l>
     <l n="503">O Chanticleer , in an unhappy hour</l>
     <l n="504">Didst thou forsake the safety of thy bower ;</l>
     <l n="505">Better for thee thou hadst believed thy dream ,</l>
     <l n="506">And not that day descended from the beam !</l>
     <l n="507">But here the doctors eagerly dispute ;</l>
     <l n="508">Some hold predestination absolute ;</l>
     <l n="509">Some clerks maintain , that Heaven at first foresees ,</l>
     <l n="510">And in the virtue of foresight decrees .</l>
     <l n="511">If this be so , then prescience binds the will ,</l>
     <l n="512">And mortals are not free to good or ill ;</l>
     <l n="513">For what he first foresaw , he must ordain ,</l>
     <l n="514">Or its eternal prescience may be vain ;</l>
     <l n="515">As bad for us as prescience had not been ;</l>
     <l n="516">For first , or last , he 's author of the sin .</l>
     <l n="517">And who says that , let the blaspheming man</l>
     <l n="518">Say worse even of the devil , if he can .</l>
     <l n="519">For how can that Eternal Power be just</l>

     <l n="523">I cannot bolt this matter to the bran ,</l>
     <l n="524">As Bradwardin<span corresp="#note187" type="note_anchor">[ 187 ]</span>and holy Austin can :</l>
     <l n="525">If prescience can determine actions so ,</l>
     <l n="526">That we must do , because he did foreknow ,</l>
     <l n="527">Or that foreknowing , yet our choice is free ,</l>
     <l n="528">Not forced to sin by strict necessity ;</l>
     <l n="529">This strict necessity they simple call ,</l>
     <l n="530">Another sort there is conditional .</l>
     <l n="531">The first so binds the will , that things foreknown</l>
     <l n="532">By spontaneity , not choice , are done .</l>
     <l n="533">Thus galley-slaves tug willing at their oar , }</l>
     <l n="534">Consent to work , in prospect of the shore ; }</l>

     <l n="536">That other does not liberty constrain ,</l>
     <l n="537">But man may either act , or may refrain .</l>
     <l n="538">Heaven made us agents free to good or ill ,</l>
     <l n="539">And forced it not , though he foresaw the will .</l>
     <l n="540">Freedom was first bestowed on human race ,</l>
     <l n="541">And prescience only held the second place .</l>
     <l n="542">If he could make such agents wholly free ,</l>
     <l n="543">I not dispute ; the point 's too high for me :</l>
     <l n="544">For heaven 's unfathomed power what man can sound ,</l>
     <l n="545">Or put to his omnipotence a bound ?</l>
     <l n="546">He made us to his image , all agree ; }</l>
     <l n="547">That image is the soul , and that must be , }</l>
     <l n="548">Or not the Maker 's image , or be free . }</l>
     <l n="549">But whether it were better man had been</l>
     <l n="550">By nature bound to good , not free to sin ,</l>
     <l n="551">I wave , for fear of splitting on a rock ;</l>
     <l n="552">The tale I tell is only of a cock ;</l>
     <l n="553">Who had not run the hazard of his life ,</l>
     <l n="554">Had he believed his dream , and not his wife :</l>
     <l n="555">For women , with a mischief to their kind ,</l>
     <l n="556">Pervert , with bad advice , our better mind .</l>
     <l n="557">A woman 's counsel brought us first to woe ,</l>
     <l n="558">And made her man his paradise forego ,</l>
     <l n="559">Where at heart 's ease he lived ; and might have been</l>
     <l n="560">As free from sorrow as he was from sin .</l>
     <l n="561">For what the devil had their sex to do ,</l>
     <l n="562">That , born to folly , they presumed to know ,</l>
     <l n="563">And could not see the serpent in the grass ?</l>
     <l n="564">But I myself presume , and let it pass .</l>
     <l n="565">Silence in times of suffering is the best ,</l>

     <l n="567">In other authors you may find enough ,</l>

     <l n="571">These are the words of Chanticleer , not mine ,</l>

     <l n="573">Now to continue what my tale begun .</l>
     <l n="574">Lay madam Partlet basking in the sun ,</l>
     <l n="575">Breast-high in sand ; her sisters , in a row ,</l>
     <l n="576">Enjoyed the beams above , the warmth below .</l>
     <l n="577">The cock , that of his flesh was ever free ,</l>
     <l n="578">Sung merrier than the mermaid in the sea ;</l>
     <l n="579">And so befel , that as he cast his eye ,</l>
     <l n="580">Among the colworts , on a butterfly ,</l>
     <l n="581">He saw false Reynard where he lay full low ;</l>
     <l n="582">I need not swear he had no list to crow ;</l>
     <l n="583">But cried , cock , cock , and gave a sudden start ,</l>
     <l n="584">As sore dismayed and frighted at his heart .</l>
     <l n="585">For birds and beasts , informed by nature , know</l>
     <l n="586">Kinds opposite to theirs , and fly their foe .</l>
     <l n="587">So Chanticleer , who never saw a fox ,</l>
     <l n="588">Yet shunned him , as a sailor shuns the rocks .</l>
     <l n="589">But the false loon , who could not work his will</l>
     <l n="590">By open force , employed his flattering skill :</l>
     <l n="591">I hope , my lord , said he , I not offend ;</l>
     <l n="592">Are you afraid of me , that am your friend ?</l>
     <l n="593">I were a beast indeed to do you wrong ,</l>
     <l n="594">I , who have loved and honoured you so long :</l>
     <l n="595">Stay , gentle Sir , nor take a false alarm ,</l>
     <l n="596">For , on my soul , I never meant you harm !</l>
     <l n="597">I come no spy , nor as a traitor press ,</l>
     <l n="598">To learn the secrets of your soft recess :</l>
     <l n="599">Far be from Reynard so profane a thought ,</l>
     <l n="600">But by the sweetness of your voice was brought :</l>
     <l n="601">For , as I bid my beads , by chance I heard</l>
     <l n="602">The song as of an angel in the yard ;</l>
     <l n="603">A song that would have charmed the infernal gods ,</l>
     <l n="604">And banished horror from the dark abodes :</l>
     <l n="605">Had Orpheus sung it in the nether sphere , }</l>
     <l n="606">So much the hymn had pleased the tyrant 's ear , }</l>
     <l n="607">The wife had been detained , to keep the husband there . }</l>
     <l n="608">My lord , your sire familiarly I knew ,</l>
     <l n="609">A peer deserving such a son as you :</l>
     <l n="610">He , with your lady-mother , ( whom heaven rest ! )</l>
     <l n="611">Has often graced my house , and been my guest :</l>
     <l n="612">To view his living features does me good ,</l>
     <l n="613">For I am your poor neighbour in the wood ;</l>
     <l n="614">And in my cottage should be proud to see</l>
     <l n="615">The worthy heir of my friend 's family .</l>
     <l n="616">But since I speak of singing , let me say ,</l>
     <l n="617">As with an upright heart I safely may ,</l>
     <l n="618">That , save yourself , there breathes not on the ground</l>
     <l n="619">One like your father for a silver sound .</l>
     <l n="620">So sweetly would he wake the winter-day , }</l>
     <l n="621">That matrons to the church mistook their way , }</l>
     <l n="622">And thought they heard the merry organ play . }</l>
     <l n="623">And he to raise his voice with artful care ,</l>
     <l n="624">( What will not beaux attempt to please the fair ? )</l>
     <l n="625">On tiptoe stood to sing with greater strength ,</l>
     <l n="626">And stretched his comely neck at all the length :</l>
     <l n="627">And while he strained his voice to pierce the skies ,</l>
     <l n="628">As saints in raptures use , would shut his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="629">That the sound striving through the narrow throat ,</l>
     <l n="630">His winking might avail to mend the note .</l>
     <l n="631">By this , in song , he never had his peer ,</l>
     <l n="632">From sweet Cecilia down to Chanticleer ;</l>
     <l n="633">Not Maro 's muse , who sung the mighty man ,</l>

    <head>THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF .</head>
     <l n="1">The argument of this piece , as given by the editors of Chaucer , runs</l>
     <l n="2">thus :—</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ A gentlewoman , out of an arbour , in a grove , seeth a great company of knights and ladies in a dance , upon the green grass . The which being ended , they all kneel down , and do honour to the daisy , some to the flower , and some to the leaf . Afterwards this gentlewoman learneth , by one of these ladies , the meaning hereof , which is this : They which honour the flower , a thing fading with every blast , are such as look after beauty and worldly pleasure ; but they that honour the leaf , which abideth with the root , notwithstanding the frosts and winter storms , are they which follow virtue and during qualities , without regard of worldly respects . ”</p>
   <p>Some farther allegory was perhaps implied in this poem . Froissart , and other French poets , had established a sort of romantic devotion to the marguerite , or daisy , probably because the homage was capable of being allegorically transferred to any distinguished lady bearing that name . Chaucer might obliquely insinuate the superior valour of the warriors , and virtue of the ladies of Albion , by proposing to them the worship of the laurel , as a more worthy object of devotion than the flower . Nor is this interpretation absolutely disproved by the homage which Chaucer himself pays to the daisy in the Legend of Alcestis .<span corresp="#note194" type="note_anchor">[ 194 ]</span>A poet is no more obliged to be consistent in his mythological creed , than constant in his devotion to one beauty , and may shift from the Grecian to the Gothic creed , or from the worship of Venus to that of Bellona . If every separate poem is consistent with itself , it would be hard to require any further uniformity .</p>
   <p>Mr Godwin has elegantly and justly characterized the present version :— “ The poem of the ‘ Floure and the Lefe ’ is a production of Chaucer , with which Dryden was ‘ so particularly pleased , both for the invention and the moral , ’ as to induce him to transfuse it into modern English . He has somewhat obscured the purpose of the tale , which in the original is defective in perspicuity ; but he has greatly heightened the enchantment of its character . He has made its personages fairies , who annually hold a jubilee , such as is here described , on the first of May ; Chaucer had left the species of the beings he employs vague and unexplained . In a word , the poem of Dryden , regarded merely as the exhibition of a soothing and delicious luxuriance of fancy , may be classed with the most successful productions of human genius . ” Life of Chaucer , Vol I. p. 344 .</p>

     <l n="36">Passed out in open air , preventing day , }</l>
     <l n="37">And sought a goodly grove , as fancy led my way . }</l>
     <l n="38">Straight as a line in beauteous order stood</l>
     <l n="39">Of oaks unshorn , a venerable wood ;</l>
     <l n="40">Fresh was the grass beneath , and every tree ,</l>
     <l n="41">At distance planted in a due degree ,</l>
     <l n="42">Their branching arms in air with equal space</l>
     <l n="43">Stretched to their neighbours with a long embrace :</l>
     <l n="44">And the new leaves on every bough were seen ,</l>
     <l n="45">Some ruddy-coloured , some of lighter green .</l>
     <l n="46">The painted birds , companions of the spring ,</l>
     <l n="47">Hopping from spray to spray , were heard to sing .</l>
     <l n="48">Both eyes and ears received a like delight ,</l>
     <l n="49">Enchanting music , and a charming sight ,</l>
     <l n="50">On Philomel I fixed my whole desire ,</l>
     <l n="51">And listened for the queen of all the quire ;</l>
     <l n="52">Fain would I hear her heavenly voice to sing ,</l>
     <l n="53">And wanted yet an omen to the spring .</l>
     <l n="54">Attending long in vain , I took the way ,</l>
     <l n="55">Which through a path , but scarcely printed , lay ;</l>
     <l n="56">In narrow mazes oft it seemed to meet ,</l>
     <l n="57">And looked as lightly pressed by fairy feet .</l>
     <l n="58">Wandering I walked alone , for still methought</l>
     <l n="59">To some strange end so strange a path was wrought :</l>
     <l n="60">At last it led me where an arbour stood ,</l>
     <l n="61">The sacred receptacle of the wood :</l>
     <l n="62">This place unmarked , though oft I walked the green ,</l>
     <l n="63">In all my progress I had never seen ;</l>
     <l n="64">And seized at once with wonder and delight ,</l>
     <l n="65">Gazed all around me , new to the transporting sight .</l>
     <l n="66">‘ Twas benched with turf , and , goodly to be seen ,</l>
     <l n="67">The thick young grass arose in fresher green :</l>
     <l n="68">The mound was newly made , no sight could pass</l>
     <l n="69">Betwixt the nice partitions of the grass ;</l>
     <l n="70">The well-united sods so closely lay ,</l>
     <l n="71">And all around the shades defended it from day ;</l>
     <l n="72">For sycamores with eglantine were spread ,</l>
     <l n="73">A hedge about the sides , a covering over head .</l>
     <l n="74">And so the fragrant brier was wove between ,</l>
     <l n="75">The sycamore and flowers were mixed with green ,</l>
     <l n="76">That nature seemed to vary the delight ,</l>
     <l n="77">And satisfied at once the smell and sight .</l>
     <l n="78">The master workman of the bower was known</l>
     <l n="79">Through fairy-lands , and built for Oberon ;</l>
     <l n="80">Who twining leaves with such proportion drew ,</l>
     <l n="81">They rose by measure , and by rule they grew ;</l>
     <l n="82">No mortal tongue can half the beauty tell ,</l>
     <l n="83">For none but hands divine could work so well .</l>
     <l n="84">Both roof and sides were like a parlour made</l>
     <l n="85">A soft recess , and a cool summer shade ;</l>
     <l n="86">The hedge was set so thick , no foreign eye</l>
     <l n="87">The persons placed within it could espy ;</l>
     <l n="88">But all that passed without with ease was seen ,</l>
     <l n="89">As if nor fence nor tree was placed between .</l>
     <l n="90">‘ Twas bordered with a field ; and some was plain</l>
     <l n="91">With grass , and some was sowed with rising grain ,</l>
     <l n="92">That ( now the dew with spangles decked the ground )</l>
     <l n="93">A sweeter spot of earth was never found .</l>
     <l n="94">I looked and looked , and still with new delight ;</l>
     <l n="95">Such joy my soul , such pleasures filled my sight ;</l>
     <l n="96">And the fresh eglantine exhaled a breath ,</l>
     <l n="97">Whose odours were of power to raise from death .</l>
     <l n="98">Nor sullen discontent , nor anxious care ,</l>
     <l n="99">Even though brought thither , could inhabit there :</l>
     <l n="100">But thence they fled as from their mortal foe ;</l>
     <l n="101">For this sweet place could only pleasure know .</l>
     <l n="102">Thus as I mused , I cast aside my eye ,</l>
     <l n="103">And saw a medlar-tree was planted nigh .</l>
     <l n="104">The spreading branches made a goodly shew ,</l>
     <l n="105">And full of opening blooms was every bough :</l>
     <l n="106">A goldfinch there I saw with gaudy pride</l>
     <l n="107">Of painted plumes , that hopped from side to side ,</l>
     <l n="108">Still pecking as she passed ; and still she drew</l>
     <l n="109">The sweets from every flower , and sucked the dew :</l>
     <l n="110">Sufficed at length , she warbled in her throat ,</l>
     <l n="111">And tuned her voice to many a merry note ,</l>
     <l n="112">But indistinct , and neither sweet nor clear ,</l>
     <l n="113">Yet such as soothed my soul , and pleased my ear .</l>
     <l n="114">Her short performance was no sooner tried ,</l>
     <l n="115">When she I sought , the nightingale , replied :</l>
     <l n="116">So sweet , so shrill , so variously she sung ,</l>
     <l n="117">That the grove echoed , and the valleys rung ;</l>
     <l n="118">And I so ravished with her heavenly note ,</l>
     <l n="119">I stood entranced , and had no room for thought ,</l>
     <l n="120">But all o'erhYpppHeNpowered with ecstasy of bliss ,</l>
     <l n="121">Was in a pleasing dream of paradise ;</l>
     <l n="122">At length I waked , and , looking round the bower ,</l>
     <l n="123">Searched every tree , and pryed on every flower ,</l>
     <l n="124">If any where by chance I might espy</l>
     <l n="125">The rural poet of the melody ;</l>
     <l n="126">For still methought she sung not far away :</l>
     <l n="127">At last I found her on a laurel spray .</l>
     <l n="128">Close by my side she sate , and fair in sight ,</l>
     <l n="129">Full in a line , against her opposite ;</l>
     <l n="130">Where stood with eglantine the laurel twined ,</l>
     <l n="131">And both their native sweets were well conjoined .</l>
     <l n="132">On the green bank I sat , and listened long ;</l>
     <l n="133">( Sitting was more convenient for the song :)</l>
     <l n="134">Nor till her lay was ended could I move ,</l>
     <l n="135">But wished to dwell for ever in the grove .</l>
     <l n="136">Only methought the time too swiftly passed ,</l>
     <l n="137">And every note I feared would be the last .</l>
     <l n="138">My sight , and smell , and hearing , were employed ,</l>
     <l n="139">And all three senses in full gust enjoyed .</l>
     <l n="140">And what alone did all the rest surpass ,</l>
     <l n="141">The sweet possession of the fairy place ;</l>
     <l n="142">Single and conscious to myself alone</l>
     <l n="143">Of pleasures to the excluded world unknown ;</l>
     <l n="144">Pleasures which no where else were to be found ,</l>
     <l n="145">And all Elysium in a spot of ground .</l>
     <l n="146">Thus while I sat intent to see and hear ,</l>
     <l n="147">And drew perfumes of more than vital air ,</l>
     <l n="148">All suddenly I heard the approaching sound</l>
     <l n="149">Of vocal music , on the enchanted ground :</l>
     <l n="150">An host of saints it seemed , so full the quire ; }</l>
     <l n="151">As if the blessed above did all conspire }</l>
     <l n="152">To join their voices , and neglect the lyre . }</l>
     <l n="153">At length there issued from the grove behind</l>
     <l n="154">A fair assembly of the female kind :</l>
     <l n="155">A train less fair , as ancient fathers tell ,</l>
     <l n="156">Seduced the sons of heaven to rebel .</l>
     <l n="157">I pass their forms , and every charming grace ;</l>
     <l n="158">Less than an angel would their worth debase :</l>
     <l n="159">But their attire , like liveries of a kind ,</l>
     <l n="160">All rich and rare , is fresh within my mind .</l>
     <l n="161">In velvet white as snow the troop was gowned ,</l>
     <l n="162">The seams with sparkling emeralds set around :</l>
     <l n="163">Their hoods and sleeves the same ; and purfled o'er</l>
     <l n="164">With diamonds , pearls , and all the shining store</l>
     <l n="165">Of eastern pomp : their long-descending train ,</l>
     <l n="166">With rubies edged , and sapphires , swept the plain :</l>
     <l n="167">High on their heads , with jewels richly set ,</l>
     <l n="168">Each lady wore a radiant coronet .</l>
     <l n="169">Beneath the circles , all the quire was graced</l>
     <l n="170">With chaplets green on their fair foreheads placed ;</l>
     <l n="171">Of laurel some , of woodbine many more ,</l>
     <l n="172">And wreaths of Agnus castus others bore :</l>
     <l n="173">These last , who with those virgin crowns were dressed ,</l>
     <l n="174">Appeared in higher honour than the rest .</l>
     <l n="175">They danced around ; but in the midst was seen }</l>
     <l n="176">A lady of a more majestic mien ; }</l>
     <l n="177">By stature , and by beauty , marked their sovereign queen . }</l>
     <l n="178">She in the midst began with sober grace ;</l>
     <l n="179">Her servants ’ eyes were fixed upon her face ,</l>
     <l n="180">And as she moved or turned , her motions viewed ,</l>
     <l n="181">Her measures kept and step by step pursued .</l>
     <l n="182">Methought she trod the ground with greater grace ,</l>
     <l n="183">With more of godhead shining in her face ;</l>
     <l n="184">And as in beauty she surpassed the quire ,</l>
     <l n="185">So , nobler than the rest was her attire .</l>
     <l n="186">A crown of ruddy gold inclosed her brow ,</l>
     <l n="187">Plain without pomp , and rich without a show :</l>
     <l n="188">A branch of Agnus castus in her hand</l>
     <l n="189">She bore aloft ( her sceptre of command ;)</l>
     <l n="190">Admired , adored by all the circling crowd ,</l>
     <l n="191">For wheresoe'er she turned her face , they bowed :</l>
     <l n="192">And as she danced , a roundelay she sung ,</l>
     <l n="193">In honour of the laurel , ever young :</l>
     <l n="194">She raised her voice on high , and sung so clear , }</l>
     <l n="195">The fawns came scudding from the groves to hear , }</l>
     <l n="196">And all the bending forest lent an ear . }</l>
     <l n="197">At every close she made , the attending throng</l>
     <l n="198">Replied , and bore the burden of the song :</l>
     <l n="199">So just , so small , yet in so sweet a note ,</l>
     <l n="200">It seemed the music melted in the throat .</l>
     <l n="201">Thus dancing on , and singing as they danced ,</l>
     <l n="202">They to the middle of the mead advanced ,</l>
     <l n="203">Till round my arbour a new ring they made ,</l>
     <l n="204">And footed it about the secret shade .</l>
     <l n="205">O'erjoyed to see the jolly troop so near ,</l>
     <l n="206">But somewhat awed , I shook with holy fear ;</l>
     <l n="207">Yet not so much , but that I noted well</l>
     <l n="208">Who did the most in song or dance excel .</l>
     <l n="209">Not long I had observed , when from afar</l>
     <l n="210">I heard a sudden symphony of war ;</l>
     <l n="211">The neighing coursers , and the soldiers ’ cry ,</l>
     <l n="212">And sounding trumps that seemed to tear the sky :</l>
     <l n="213">I saw soon after this , behind the grove</l>
     <l n="214">From whence the ladies did in order move ,</l>
     <l n="215">Come issuing out in arms a warrior train ,</l>
     <l n="216">That like a deluge poured upon the plain :</l>
     <l n="217">On barbed steeds they rode in proud array ,</l>
     <l n="218">Thick as the college of the bees in May ,</l>
     <l n="219">When swarming o'er the dusky fields they fly ,</l>
     <l n="220">New to the flowers , and intercept the sky .</l>
     <l n="221">So fierce they drove , their coursers were so fleet ,</l>
     <l n="222">That the turf trembled underneath their feet .</l>
     <l n="223">To tell their costly furniture were long ,</l>
     <l n="224">The summer 's day would end before the song :</l>
     <l n="225">To purchase but the tenth of all their store ,</l>
     <l n="226">Would make the mighty Persian monarch poor .</l>
     <l n="227">Yet what I can , I will : before the rest</l>
     <l n="228">The trumpets issued in white mantles dressed ;</l>
     <l n="229">A numerous troop , and all their heads around }</l>
     <l n="230">With chaplets green of cerrial-oak were crowned , }</l>
     <l n="231">And at each trumpet was a banner bound ; }</l>
     <l n="232">Which , waving in the wind , displayed at large</l>
     <l n="233">Their master 's coat-of-arms , and knightly charge .</l>
     <l n="234">Broad were the banners , and of snowy hue ,</l>
     <l n="235">A purer web the silk-worm never drew .</l>
     <l n="236">The chief about their necks the scutcheons wore ,</l>
     <l n="237">With orient pearls and jewels powdered o'er :</l>
     <l n="238">Broad were their collars too , and every one</l>
     <l n="239">Was set about with many a costly stone .<span corresp="#note196" type="note_anchor">[ 196 ]</span></l>
     <l n="240">Next these , of kings-at-arms a goodly train</l>
     <l n="241">In proud array came prancing o'er the plain :</l>
     <l n="242">Their cloaks were cloth of silver mixed with gold ,</l>
     <l n="243">And garlands green around their temples rolled :</l>
     <l n="244">Rich crowns were on their royal scutcheons placed ,</l>
     <l n="245">With sapphires , diamonds , and with rubies graced :</l>
     <l n="246">And as the trumpets their appearance made ,</l>
     <l n="247">So these in habits were alike arrayed ;</l>
     <l n="248">But with a pace more sober , and more slow ,</l>
     <l n="249">And twenty , rank in rank , they rode a-row .</l>
     <l n="250">The pursuivants came next , in number more ;</l>
     <l n="251">And like the heralds each his scutcheon bore :</l>
     <l n="252">Clad in white velvet all their troop they led ,</l>
     <l n="253">With each an oaken chaplet on his head .</l>
     <l n="254">Nine royal knights in equal rank succeed ,</l>
     <l n="255">Each warrior mounted on a fiery steed ,</l>
     <l n="256">In golden armour glorious to behold ;</l>
     <l n="257">The rivets<span corresp="#note197" type="note_anchor">[ 197 ]</span>of their arms were nailed with gold .</l>
     <l n="258">Their surcoats of white ermine-fur were made ;</l>
     <l n="259">With cloth of gold between , that cast a glittering shade .</l>
     <l n="260">The trappings of their steeds were of the same ;</l>
     <l n="261">The golden fringe even set the ground on flame ,</l>
     <l n="262">And drew a precious trail : a crown divine</l>
     <l n="263">Of laurel did about their temples twine .</l>
     <l n="264">Three henchmen<span corresp="#note198" type="note_anchor">[ 198 ]</span>were for every knight assigned ,</l>
     <l n="265">All in rich livery clad , and of a kind ;</l>
     <l n="266">White velvet , but unshorn , for cloaks they wore ,</l>
     <l n="267">And each within his hand a truncheon bore :</l>
     <l n="268">The foremost held a helm of rare device ;</l>
     <l n="269">A prince 's ransom would not pay the price .</l>
     <l n="270">The second bore the buckler of his knight , }</l>
     <l n="271">The third of cornel-wood a spear upright , }</l>
     <l n="272">Headed with piercing steel , and polished bright . }</l>
     <l n="273">Like to their lords their equipage was seen ,</l>
     <l n="274">And all their foreheads crowned with garlands green .</l>
     <l n="275">And after these came armed with spear and shield</l>
     <l n="276">An host so great , as covered all the field :</l>
     <l n="277">And all their foreheads , like the knights ’ before ,</l>
     <l n="278">With laurels ever-green were shaded o'er ,</l>
     <l n="279">Or oak , or other leaves of lasting kind ,</l>
     <l n="280">Tenacious of the stem , and firm against the wind .</l>
     <l n="281">Some in their hands , beside the lance and shield ,</l>
     <l n="282">The boughs of woodbine or of hawthorn held ,</l>
     <l n="283">Or branches for their mystic emblems took ,</l>
     <l n="284">Of palm , of laurel , or of cerrial oak .</l>
     <l n="285">Thus marching to the trumpet 's lofty sound , }</l>
     <l n="286">Drawn in two lines adverse they wheeled around , }</l>
     <l n="287">And in the middle meadow took their ground . }</l>
     <l n="288">Among themselves the tourney they divide ,</l>
     <l n="289">In equal squadrons ranged on either side ;</l>
     <l n="290">Then turned their horses ’ heads , and man to man ,</l>
     <l n="291">And steed to steed opposed , the justs began .</l>
     <l n="292">They lightly set their lances in the rest ,</l>
     <l n="293">And , at the sign , against each other pressed ;</l>
     <l n="294">They met . I sitting at my ease beheld</l>
     <l n="295">The mixed events , and fortunes of the field .</l>
     <l n="296">Some broke their spears , some tumbled horse and man ,</l>
     <l n="297">And round the fields the lightened coursers ran .</l>
     <l n="298">An hour and more , like tides , in equal sway</l>
     <l n="299">They rushed , and won by turns , and lost the day :</l>
     <l n="300">At length the nine ( who still together held ) }</l>
     <l n="301">Their fainting foes to shameful flight compelled , }</l>
     <l n="302">And with resistless force o'erhYpppHeNran the field . }</l>
     <l n="303">Thus , to their fame , when finished was the fight ,</l>
     <l n="304">The victors from their lofty steeds alight :</l>
     <l n="305">Like them dismounted all the warlike train ,</l>
     <l n="306">And two by two proceeded o'er the plain ;</l>
     <l n="307">Till to the fair assembly they advanced ,</l>
     <l n="308">Who near the secret arbour sung and danced .</l>
     <l n="309">The ladies left their measures at the sight , }</l>
     <l n="310">To meet the chiefs returning from the fight , }</l>
     <l n="311">And each with open arms embraced her chosen knight . }</l>
     <l n="312">Amid the plain a spreading laurel stood ,</l>
     <l n="313">The grace and ornament of all the wood :</l>
     <l n="314">That pleasing shade they sought , a soft retreat</l>
     <l n="315">From sudden April showers , a shelter from the heat :</l>
     <l n="316">Her leafy arms with such extent were spread ,</l>
     <l n="317">So near the clouds was her aspiring head ,</l>
     <l n="318">That hosts of birds , that wing the liquid air ,</l>
     <l n="319">Perched in the boughs , had nightly lodging there :</l>
     <l n="320">And flocks of sheep beneath the shade from far</l>
     <l n="321">Might hear the rattling hail , and wintry war ;</l>
     <l n="322">From heaven 's inclemency here found retreat ,</l>
     <l n="323">Enjoyed the cool , and shunned the scorching heat :</l>
     <l n="324">A hundred knights might there at ease abide ,</l>
     <l n="325">And every knight a lady by his side :</l>
     <l n="326">The trunk itself such odours did bequeath ,</l>
     <l n="327">That a Moluccan breeze to these was common breath .</l>
     <l n="328">The lords and ladies here , approaching , paid }</l>
     <l n="329">Their homage , with a low obeisance made , }</l>
     <l n="330">And seemed to venerate the sacred shade . }</l>
     <l n="331">These rites performed , their pleasures they pursue ,</l>
     <l n="332">With songs of love , and mix with measures<span corresp="#note199" type="note_anchor">[ 199 ]</span>new ;</l>
     <l n="333">Around the holy tree their dance they frame ,</l>
     <l n="334">And every champion leads his chosen dame .</l>
     <l n="335">I cast my sight upon the farther field ,</l>
     <l n="336">And a fresh object of delight beheld :</l>
     <l n="337">For from the region of the west I heard</l>
     <l n="338">New music sound , and a new troop appeared ;</l>
     <l n="339">Of knights , and ladies mixed a jolly band ,</l>
     <l n="340">But all on foot they marched , and hand in hand .</l>
     <l n="341">The ladies dressed in rich symars were seen }</l>
     <l n="342">Of Florence sattin , flowered with white and green , }</l>
     <l n="343">And for a shade betwixt the bloomy gridelin . }</l>
     <l n="344">The borders of their petticoats below</l>
     <l n="345">Were guarded thick with rubies on a row ;</l>
     <l n="346">And every damsel wore upon her head</l>
     <l n="347">Of flowers a garland blended white and red .</l>
     <l n="348">Attired in mantles all the knights were seen ,</l>
     <l n="349">That gratified the view with cheerful green :</l>
     <l n="350">Their chaplets of their ladies ’ colours were ,</l>
     <l n="351">Composed of white and red , to shade their shining hair .</l>
     <l n="352">Before the merry troop the minstrels played ;</l>
     <l n="353">All in their masters ’ liveries were arrayed ,</l>
     <l n="354">And clad in green , and on their temples wore</l>
     <l n="355">The chaplets white and red their ladies bore .</l>
     <l n="356">Their instruments were various in their kind ,</l>
     <l n="357">Some for the bow , and some for breathing wind ;</l>
     <l n="358">The sawtry ,<span corresp="#note200" type="note_anchor">[ 200 ]</span>pipe , and hautboy 's noisy band ,</l>
     <l n="359">And the soft lute trembling beneath the touching hand .</l>
     <l n="360">A tuft of daisies on a flowery lea</l>
     <l n="361">They saw , and thitherward they bent their way ;</l>
     <l n="362">To this both knights and dames their homage made ,</l>
     <l n="363">And due obeisance to the daisy paid .</l>
     <l n="364">And then the band of flutes began to play ,</l>
     <l n="365">To which a lady sung a virelay :[ 201 ]</l>
     <l n="366">And still at every close she would repeat</l>
     <l n="367">The burden of the song , The daisy is so sweet .</l>
     <l n="368">The daisy is so sweet , when she begun ,</l>
     <l n="369">The troop of knights and dames continued on .</l>
     <l n="370">The concert and the voice so charmed my ear ,</l>
     <l n="371">And soothed my soul , that it was heaven to hear .</l>
     <l n="372">But soon their pleasure passed ; at noon of day ,</l>
     <l n="373">The sun with sultry beams began to play :</l>
     <l n="374">Not Sirius shoots a fiercer flame from high ,</l>
     <l n="375">When with his poisonous breath he blasts the sky ;</l>
     <l n="376">Then drooped the fading flowers ( their beauty fled ) }</l>
     <l n="377">And closed their sickly eyes , and hung the head , }</l>
     <l n="378">And , rivelled up with heat , lay dying in their bed . }</l>
     <l n="379">The ladies gasped , and scarcely could respire</l>
     <l n="380">The breath they drew , no longer air but fire ;</l>
     <l n="381">The fainty knights were scorched ; and knew not where</l>
     <l n="382">To run for shelter , for no shade was near .</l>
     <l n="383">And after this the gathering clouds amain</l>
     <l n="384">Poured down a storm of rattling hail and rain ;</l>
     <l n="385">And lightning flashed betwixt : the field , and flowers ,</l>
     <l n="386">Burnt up before , were buried in the showers .</l>
     <l n="387">The ladies and the knights , no shelter nigh ,</l>
     <l n="388">Bare to the weather and the wintry sky ,</l>
     <l n="389">Were dropping wet , disconsolate , and wan ,</l>
     <l n="390">And through their thin array received the rain ;</l>
     <l n="391">While those in white , protected by the tree ,</l>
     <l n="392">Saw pass the vain assault , and stood from danger free .</l>
     <l n="393">But as compassion moved their gentle minds ,</l>
     <l n="394">When ceased the storm , and silent were the winds ,</l>
     <l n="395">Displeased at what , not suffering , they had seen ,</l>
     <l n="396">They went to cheer the faction of the green :</l>
     <l n="397">The queen in white array , before her band ,</l>
     <l n="398">Saluting , took her rival by the hand ;</l>
     <l n="399">So did the knights and dames , with courtly grace ,</l>
     <l n="400">And with behaviour sweet their foes embrace .</l>
     <l n="401">Then thus the queen with laurel on her brow ,—</l>
     <l n="402">Fair sister , I have suffered in your woe ;</l>
     <l n="403">Nor shall be wanting aught within my power</l>
     <l n="404">For your relief in my refreshing bower .—</l>
     <l n="405">That other answered with a lowly look ,</l>
     <l n="406">And soon the gracious invitation took :</l>
     <l n="407">For ill at ease both she and all her train</l>
     <l n="408">The scorching sun had borne , and beating rain .</l>
     <l n="409">Like courtesy was used by all in white ,</l>
     <l n="410">Each dame a dame received , and every knight a knight .</l>
     <l n="411">The laurel champions with their swords invade</l>
     <l n="412">The neighboring forests , where the justs were made ,</l>
     <l n="413">And sere wood from the rotten hedges took ,</l>
     <l n="414">And seeds of latent fire from flints provoke :</l>
     <l n="415">A cheerful blaze arose , and by the fire</l>
     <l n="416">They warmed their frozen feet , and dried their wet attire .</l>
     <l n="417">Refreshed with heat , the ladies sought around</l>
     <l n="418">For virtuous herbs , which gathered from the ground</l>
     <l n="419">They squeezed the juice , and cooling ointment made ,</l>
     <l n="420">Which on their sun-burnt cheeks , and their chapt skins , they laid ;</l>
     <l n="421">Then sought green sallads , which they bade them eat ,</l>
     <l n="422">A sovereign remedy for inward heat .</l>
     <l n="423">The Lady of the Leaf ordained a feast ,</l>
     <l n="424">And made the Lady of the Flower her guest :</l>
     <l n="425">When lo , a bower ascended on the plain ,</l>
     <l n="426">With sudden seats adorned , and large for either train .</l>
     <l n="427">This bower was near my pleasant arbour placed ,</l>
     <l n="428">That I could hear and see whatever passed :</l>
     <l n="429">The ladies sat with each a knight between ,</l>
     <l n="430">Distinguished by their colours , white and green ;</l>
     <l n="431">The vanquished party with the victors joined ,</l>
     <l n="432">Nor wanted sweet discourse , the banquet of the mind .</l>
     <l n="433">Meantime the minstrels played on either side ,</l>
     <l n="434">Vain of their art , and for the mastery vied :</l>
     <l n="435">The sweet contention lasted for an hour ,</l>
     <l n="436">And reached my secret arbour from the bower .</l>
     <l n="437">The sun was set ; and Vesper , to supply</l>
     <l n="438">His absent beams , had lighted up the sky :</l>
     <l n="439">When Philomel , officious all the day</l>
     <l n="440">To sing the service of the ensuing May ,</l>
     <l n="441">Fled from her laurel shade , and winged her flight</l>
     <l n="442">Directly to the queen arrayed in white ;</l>
     <l n="443">And hopping sat familiar on her hand ,</l>
     <l n="444">A new musician , and increased the band .</l>
     <l n="445">The goldfinch , who , to shun the scalding heat ,</l>
     <l n="446">Had changed the medlar for a safer seat ,</l>
     <l n="447">And hid in bushes ‘ scaped the bitter shower ,</l>
     <l n="448">Now perched upon the Lady of the Flower ;</l>
     <l n="449">And either songster holding out their throats ,</l>
     <l n="450">And folding up their wings , renewed their notes ;</l>
     <l n="451">As if all day , preluding to the fight ,</l>
     <l n="452">They only had rehearsed , to sing by night .</l>
     <l n="453">The banquet ended , and the battle done ,</l>
     <l n="454">They danced by star-light and the friendly moon :</l>
     <l n="455">And when they were to part , the laureat queen</l>
     <l n="456">Supplied with steeds the lady of the green .</l>
     <l n="457">Her and her train conducting on the way ,</l>
     <l n="458">The moon to follow , and avoid the day .</l>
     <l n="459">This when I saw , inquisitive to know</l>
     <l n="460">The secret moral of the mystic show ,</l>
     <l n="461">I started from my shade , in hopes to find</l>
     <l n="462">Some nymph to satisfy my longing mind ;</l>
     <l n="463">And as my fair adventure fell , I found</l>
     <l n="464">A lady all in white , with laurel crowned ,</l>
     <l n="465">Who closed the rear , and softly paced along ,</l>
     <l n="466">Repeating to herself the former song .</l>
     <l n="467">With due respect my body I inclined ,</l>
     <l n="468">As to some being of superior kind ,</l>
     <l n="469">And made my court according to the day ,</l>
     <l n="470">Wishing her queen and her a happy May .</l>
     <l n="471">Great thanks , my daughter , with a gracious bow</l>
     <l n="472">She said ; and I , who much desired to know</l>
     <l n="473">Of whence she was , yet fearful how to break</l>
     <l n="474">My mind , adventured humbly thus to speak :—</l>
     <l n="475">Madam , might I presume and not offend ,</l>
     <l n="476">So may the stars and shining moon attend</l>
     <l n="477">Your nightly sports , as you vouchsafe to tell , }</l>
     <l n="478">What nymphs they were who mortal forms excel , }</l>
     <l n="479">And what the knights who fought in listed fields so well .— }</l>
     <l n="480">To this the dame replied : Fair daughter , know ,</l>
     <l n="481">That what you saw was all a fairy show ;</l>
     <l n="482">And all those airy shapes you now behold ,</l>
     <l n="483">Were human bodies once , and clothed with earthly mold :</l>
     <l n="484">Our souls , not yet prepared for upper light ,</l>
     <l n="485">Till doomsday wander in the shades of night ;</l>
     <l n="486">This only holiday of all the year ,</l>
     <l n="487">We , privileged , in sunshine may appear ;</l>
     <l n="488">With songs and dance we celebrate the day ,</l>
     <l n="489">And with due honours usher in the May .</l>
     <l n="490">At other times we reign by night alone ,</l>
     <l n="491">And posting through the skies pursue the moon ;</l>
     <l n="492">But when the morn arises , none are found ,</l>
     <l n="493">For cruel Demogorgon walks the round ,</l>
     <l n="494">And if he finds a fairy lag in light ,</l>
     <l n="495">He drives the wretch before , and lashes into night .</l>
     <l n="496">All courteous are by kind ; and ever proud</l>
     <l n="497">With friendly offices to help the good .</l>
     <l n="498">In every land we have a larger space</l>
     <l n="499">Than what is known to you of mortal race ;</l>
     <l n="500">Where we with green adorn our fairy bowers ,</l>
     <l n="501">And even this grove , unseen before , is ours .</l>
     <l n="502">Know farther ; every lady clothed in white ,</l>
     <l n="503">And , crowned with oak and laurel every knight ,</l>
     <l n="504">Are servants to the leaf , by liveries known</l>
     <l n="505">Of innocence ; and I myself am one .</l>
     <l n="506">Saw you not her so graceful to behold</l>
     <l n="507">In white attire , and crowned with radiant gold ?</l>
     <l n="508">The sovereign lady of our land is she ,</l>
     <l n="509">Diana called , the queen of chastity ;</l>
     <l n="510">And , for the spotless name of maid she bears ,</l>
     <l n="511">That Agnus castus in her hand appears ;</l>
     <l n="512">And all her train , with leafy chaplets crowned ,</l>
     <l n="513">Were for unblamed virginity renowned ;</l>
     <l n="514">But those the chief and highest in command</l>
     <l n="515">Who bear those holy branches in their hand :</l>
     <l n="516">The knights adorned with laurel crowns are they , }</l>
     <l n="517">Whom death nor danger ever could dismay , }</l>
     <l n="518">Victorious names , who made the world obey : }</l>
     <l n="519">Who , while they lived , in deeds of arms excelled ,</l>
     <l n="520">And after death for deities were held .</l>
     <l n="521">But those , who wear the woodbine on their brow ,</l>
     <l n="522">Were knights of love , who never broke their vow ;</l>
     <l n="523">Firm to their plighted faith , and ever free</l>
     <l n="524">From fears , and fickle chance , and jealousy .</l>
     <l n="525">The lords and ladies , who the woodbine bear ,</l>
     <l n="526">As true as Tristram and Isotta were .—</l>
     <l n="527">But what are those , said I , the unconquered nine ,</l>
     <l n="528">Who , crowned with laurel-wreaths , in golden armour shine ?</l>
     <l n="529">And who the knights in green , and what the train</l>
     <l n="530">Of ladies dressed with daisies on the plain ?</l>
     <l n="531">Why both the bands in worship disagree ,</l>
     <l n="532">And some adore the flower , and some the tree ?—</l>
     <l n="533">Just is your suit , fair daughter , said the dame :</l>
     <l n="534">Those laurelled chiefs were men of mighty fame ;</l>
     <l n="535">Nine worthies were they called of different rites ,</l>
     <l n="536">Three Jews , three Pagans , and three Christian knights .<span corresp="#note202" type="note_anchor">[ 202 ]</span></l>
     <l n="537">These , as you see , ride foremost in the field , }</l>
     <l n="538">As they the foremost rank of honour held , }</l>
     <l n="539">And all in deeds of chivalry excelled : }</l>
     <l n="540">Their temples wreathed with leaves , that still renew ,</l>
     <l n="541">For deathless laurel is the victor 's due .</l>
     <l n="542">Who bear the bows were knights in Arthur 's reign ,</l>
     <l n="543">Twelve they , and twelve the peers of Charlemain ;</l>
     <l n="544">For bows the strength of brawny arms imply ,</l>
     <l n="545">Emblems of valour , and of victory .<span corresp="#note203" type="note_anchor">[ 203 ]</span></l>
     <l n="546">Behold an order yet of newer date ,</l>
     <l n="547">Doubling their number , equal in their state ;</l>
     <l n="548">Our England 's ornament , the crown 's defence ,</l>
     <l n="549">In battle brave , protectors of their prince ;</l>
     <l n="550">Unchanged by fortune , to their sovereign true ,</l>
     <l n="551">For which their manly legs are bound with blue .</l>
     <l n="552">These , of the garter called , of faith unstained , }</l>
     <l n="553">In fighting fields the laurel have obtained , }</l>
     <l n="554">And well repaid those honours which they gained . }</l>
     <l n="555">The laurel wreaths were first by Cæsar worn ,</l>
     <l n="556">And still they Cæsar 's successors adorn ;</l>
     <l n="557">One leaf of this is immortality ,</l>
     <l n="558">And more of worth than all the world can buy .—</l>
     <l n="559">One doubt remains , said I ; the dames in green ,</l>
     <l n="560">What were their qualities , and who their queen ?—</l>
     <l n="561">Flora commands , said she , those nymphs and knights ,</l>
     <l n="562">Who lived in slothful ease and loose delights ;</l>
     <l n="563">Who never acts of honour durst pursue ,</l>
     <l n="564">The men inglorious knights , the ladies all untrue ;</l>
     <l n="565">Who , nursed in idleness , and trained in courts ,</l>
     <l n="566">Passed all their precious hours in plays and sports ,</l>
     <l n="567">Till death behind came stalking on , unseen ,</l>
     <l n="568">And withered ( like the storm ) the freshness of their green .</l>
     <l n="569">These , and their mates , enjoy the present hour ,</l>
     <l n="570">And therefore pay their homage to the flower .</l>
     <l n="571">But knights in knightly deeds should persevere , }</l>
     <l n="572">And still continue what at first they were ; }</l>
     <l n="573">Continue , and proceed in honour 's fair career . }</l>
     <l n="574">No room for cowardice , or dull delay ;</l>
     <l n="575">From good to better they should urge their way .</l>
     <l n="576">For this with golden spurs the chiefs are graced ,</l>
     <l n="577">With pointed rowels armed , to mend their haste ;</l>
     <l n="578">For this with lasting leaves their brows are bound ; }</l>
     <l n="579">For laurel is the sign of labour crowned , }</l>
     <l n="580">Which bears the bitter blast , nor shaken falls to ground : }</l>
     <l n="581">From winter winds it suffers no decay ,</l>
     <l n="582">For ever fresh and fair , and every month is May .</l>
     <l n="583">Even when the vital sap retreats below ,</l>
     <l n="584">Even when the hoary head is hid in snow ,</l>
     <l n="585">The life is in the leaf , and still between</l>
     <l n="586">The fits of falling snows appears the streaky green .</l>
     <l n="587">Not so the flower , which lasts for little space ,</l>
     <l n="588">A short-lived good , and an uncertain grace :</l>
     <l n="589">This way and that the feeble stem is driven ,</l>
     <l n="590">Weak to sustain the storms and injuries of heaven .</l>
     <l n="591">Propped by the spring , it lifts aloft the head , }</l>
     <l n="592">But of a sickly beauty , soon to shed ; }</l>
     <l n="593">In summer living , and in winter dead . }</l>
     <l n="594">For things of tender kind , for pleasure made ,</l>
     <l n="595">Shoot up with swift increase , and sudden are decayed .—</l>
     <l n="596">With humble words , the wisest I could frame ,</l>
     <l n="597">And proffered service , I repaid the dame ;</l>
     <l n="598">That , of her grace , she gave her maid to know</l>
     <l n="599">The secret meaning of this moral show .</l>
     <l n="600">And she , to prove what profit I had made</l>
     <l n="601">Of mystic truth , in fables first conveyed ,</l>
     <l n="602">Demanded till the next returning May ,</l>
     <l n="603">Whether the leaf or flower I would obey ?</l>
     <l n="604">I chose the leaf ; she smiled with sober cheer ,</l>
     <l n="605">And wished me fair adventure for the year ,</l>
     <l n="606">And gave me charms and sigils , for defence</l>
     <l n="607">Against ill tongues that scandal innocence :—</l>
     <l n="608">But I , said she , my fellows must pursue ,</l>
     <l n="609">Already past the plain , and out of view .—</l>
     <l n="610">We parted thus ; I homeward sped my way , }</l>
     <l n="611">Bewildered in the wood till dawn of day ; }</l>
     <l n="612">And met the merry crew , who danced about the May . }</l>
     <l n="613">Then late refreshed with sleep , I rose to write</l>
     <l n="614">The visionary vigils of the night .</l>
     <l n="615">Blush , as thou may'st , my little book , for shame ,</l>
     <l n="616">Nor hope with homely verse to purchase fame ;</l>
     <l n="617">For such thy maker chose , and so designed</l>
     <l n="618">Thy simple style to suit thy lowly kind .</l>

   <p>The bow , though the youth trained to chivalry were taught to use it , made no part of a knight 's proper weapons . But it is curious how Dryden , having fallen into an error , finds out a reason for his false reading , by alleging , that the bows were borne as an emblem of strength of arm , valour , and victory .

   <p>THE WIFE OF BATH .</p>
   <p>The original of this tale should probably be sought in some ancient metrical romance . At least , we know , that there exists a ballad connected with the Round Table Romances , entitled “ The Marriage of Sir Gawain , ” which seems to have been taken , not from Chaucer , but some more ancient and romantic legend . Gower also had seized upon this subject , and wrought it into the tale , entitled “ Florent , ” which is the most pleasing in his dull Confessio Amantis . But what was a mere legendary tale of wonder in the rhime of the minstrel , and a vehicle for trite morality in that of Gower , in the verse of Chaucer reminds us of the resurrection of a skeleton , reinvested by miracle with flesh , complexion , and powers of life and motion . Of all Chaucer 's multifarious powers , none is more wonderful than the humour , with which he touched upon natural frailty , and the truth with which he describes the inward feelings of the human heart ; at a time when all around were employed in composing romantic legends , in which the real character of their heroes was as effectually disguised by the stiffness of their manners , as their shapes by the sharp angles and unnatural projections of their plate armour .</p>
   <p>Dryden , who probably did not like the story worse , that it contained a passing satire against priests and women , has bestowed considerable pains upon his version . It is , perhaps , not to be regretted , that he left the Prologue to Pope , who has drawn a veil over the coarse nakedness of Father Chaucer . The tale is characteristically placed by the original author , in the mouth of the buxom Wife of Bath , whose mode of governing her different husbands is so ludicrously described in the Prologue .</p>

    <head>THE</head>
    <head>WIFE OF BATH</head>
    <head>HER</head>
    <head>TALE .</head>
     <l n="1">In days of old , when Arthur filled the throne ,</l>
     <l n="2">Whose acts and fame to foreign lands were blown ;</l>
     <l n="3">The king of elves , and little fairy queen ,</l>
     <l n="4">Gambolled on heaths , and danced on every green ;</l>
     <l n="5">And where the jolly troop had led the round ,</l>
     <l n="6">The grass unbidden rose , and marked the ground .</l>
     <l n="7">Nor darkling did they dance ;<span corresp="#note204" type="note_anchor">[ 204 ]</span>the silver light }</l>
     <l n="8">Of Phœbe served to guide their steps aright , }</l>
     <l n="9">And , with their tripping pleased , prolonged the night . }</l>
     <l n="10">Her beams they followed , where at full she played , }</l>
     <l n="11">Nor longer than she shed her horns they staid , }</l>
     <l n="12">From thence with airy flight to foreign lands conveyed . }</l>
     <l n="13">Above the rest our Britain held they dear ; }</l>
     <l n="14">More solemnly they kept their Sabbaths here , }</l>
     <l n="15">And made more spacious rings , and revelled half the year . }</l>
     <l n="16">I speak of ancient times ; for now the swain , }</l>
     <l n="17">Returning late , may pass the woods in vain , }</l>
     <l n="18">And never hope to see the nightly train ; }</l>
     <l n="19">In vain the dairy now with mints is dressed , }</l>
     <l n="20">The dairy-maid expects no fairy guest }</l>
     <l n="21">To skim the bowls , and after pay the feast . }</l>
     <l n="22">She sighs , and shakes her empty shoes in vain ,</l>
     <l n="23">No silver penny to reward her pain ;</l>
     <l n="24">For priests , with prayers , and other godly gear ,</l>
     <l n="25">Have made the merry goblins disappear ;</l>
     <l n="26">And where they played their merry pranks before ,</l>
     <l n="27">Have sprinkled holy water on the floor ;</l>
     <l n="28">And friars , that through the wealthy regions run ,</l>
     <l n="29">Thick as the motes that twinkle in the sun ,</l>
     <l n="30">Resort to farmers rich , and bless their halls ,</l>
     <l n="31">And exorcise the beds , and cross the walls :</l>
     <l n="32">This makes the fairy quires forsake the place ,</l>
     <l n="33">When once ‘ tis hallowed with the rites of grace .</l>
     <l n="34">But in the walks , where wicked elves have been , }</l>
     <l n="35">The learning of the parish now is seen ; }</l>
     <l n="36">The midnight parson , posting o'er the green , }</l>
     <l n="37">With gown tucked up to wakes ; for Sunday next , }</l>
     <l n="38">With humming ale encouraging his text ; }</l>
     <l n="39">Nor wants the holy leer to country-girl betwixt . }</l>
     <l n="40">From fiends and imps he sets the village free ,</l>
     <l n="41">There haunts not any incubus but he .</l>
     <l n="42">The maids and women need no danger fear</l>
     <l n="43">To walk by night , and sanctity so near ;</l>
     <l n="44">For by some haycock , or some shady thorn ,</l>
     <l n="45">He bids his beads both even-song and morn .<span corresp="#note205" type="note_anchor">[ 205 ]</span></l>
     <l n="46">It so befel in this king Arthur 's reign , }</l>
     <l n="47">A lusty knight was pricking o'er the plain ; }</l>
     <l n="48">A bachelor he was , and of the courtly train . }</l>
     <l n="49">It happened as he rode , a damsel gay ,</l>
     <l n="50">In russet robes , to market took her way ;</l>
     <l n="51">Soon on the girl he cast an amorous eye ;</l>
     <l n="52">So straight she walked , and on her pasterns high :</l>
     <l n="53">If seeing her behind he liked her pace ,</l>
     <l n="54">Now turning short , he better liked her face .</l>
     <l n="55">He lights in haste , and , full of youthful fire ,</l>
     <l n="56">By force accomplished his obscene desire .</l>
     <l n="57">This done , away he rode , not unespied ,</l>
     <l n="58">For , swarming at his back , the country cried ;</l>
     <l n="59">And , once in view , they never lost the sight ,</l>
     <l n="60">But seized , and , pinioned , brought to court the knight .</l>
     <l n="61">Then courts of kings were held in high renown ,</l>
     <l n="62">Ere made the common brothels of the town ;</l>
     <l n="63">There virgins honourable vows received ,</l>
     <l n="64">But chaste as maids in monasteries lived ;</l>
     <l n="65">The king himself , to nuptial ties a slave ,</l>
     <l n="66">No bad example to his poets gave .</l>
     <l n="67">And they , not bad but in a vicious age ,</l>
     <l n="68">Had not , to please the prince , debauched the stage .<span corresp="#note206" type="note_anchor">[ 206 ]</span></l>
     <l n="69">Now , what should Arthur do ? He loved the knight ,</l>
     <l n="70">But sovereign monarchs are the source of right :</l>
     <l n="71">Moved by the damsel 's tears and common cry ,</l>
     <l n="72">He doomed the brutal ravisher to die .</l>
     <l n="73">But fair Geneura<span corresp="#note207" type="note_anchor">[ 207 ]</span>rose in his defence ,</l>
     <l n="74">And prayed so hard for mercy from the prince ,</l>
     <l n="75">That to his queen the king the offender gave ,</l>
     <l n="76">And left it in her power to kill or save .</l>
     <l n="77">This gracious act the ladies all approve ,</l>
     <l n="78">Who thought it much a man should die for love ;</l>
     <l n="79">And , with their mistress , joined in close debate , }</l>
     <l n="80">( Covering their kindness with dissembled hate ,) }</l>
     <l n="81">If not to free him , to prolong his fate . }</l>
     <l n="82">At last agreed , they called him by consent</l>
     <l n="83">Before the queen and female parliament .</l>
     <l n="84">And the fair speaker , rising from her chair ,</l>
     <l n="85">Did thus the judgment of the house declare :—</l>
     <l n="86">Sir knight , though I have asked thy life , yet still</l>
     <l n="87">Thy destiny depends upon my will :</l>
     <l n="88">Nor hast thou other surety , than the grace ,</l>
     <l n="89">Not due to thee , from our offended race .</l>
     <l n="90">But as our kind is of a softer mold ,</l>
     <l n="91">And cannot blood , without a sigh , behold ,</l>
     <l n="92">I grant thee life ; reserving still the power</l>
     <l n="93">To take the forfeit when I see my hour ;</l>
     <l n="94">Unless thy answer to my next demand</l>
     <l n="95">Shall set thee free from our avenging hand .</l>
     <l n="96">The question , whose solution I require ,</l>
     <l n="97">Is , what the sex of women most desire ?</l>
     <l n="98">In this dispute thy judges are at strife ;</l>
     <l n="99">Beware , for on thy wit depends thy life .</l>
     <l n="100">Yet ( lest surprised , unknowing what to say ,</l>
     <l n="101">Thou damn thyself ) we give thee farther day ;</l>
     <l n="102">A year is thine to wander at thy will ,</l>
     <l n="103">And learn from others , if thou want'st the skill ;</l>
     <l n="104">But , not to hold our proffer 'd turn in scorn ,</l>
     <l n="105">Good sureties will we have for thy return ,</l>
     <l n="106">That at the time prefixed thou shalt obey ,</l>
     <l n="107">And at thy pledge 's peril keep thy day .—</l>
     <l n="108">Woe was the knight at this severe command ,</l>
     <l n="109">But well he knew ‘ twas bootless to withstand .</l>
     <l n="110">The terms accepted , as the fair ordain ,</l>
     <l n="111">He put in bail for his return again ;</l>
     <l n="112">And promised answer at the day assigned ,</l>
     <l n="113">The best , with heaven 's assistance , he could find .</l>
     <l n="114">His leave thus taken , on his way he went }</l>
     <l n="115">With heavy heart , and full of discontent , }</l>
     <l n="116">Misdoubting much , and fearful of the event . }</l>
     <l n="117">‘ Twas hard the truth of such a point to find ,</l>
     <l n="118">As was not yet agreed among the kind .</l>
     <l n="119">Thus on he went ; still anxious more and more ,</l>
     <l n="120">Asked all he met , and knocked at every door ;</l>
     <l n="121">Enquired of men ; but made his chief request</l>
     <l n="122">To learn from women what they loved the best .</l>
     <l n="123">They answered each , according to her mind ,</l>
     <l n="124">To please herself , not all the female kind .</l>
     <l n="125">One was for wealth , another was for place ;</l>
     <l n="126">Crones , old and ugly , wished a better face .</l>
     <l n="127">The widow 's wish was oftentimes to wed ;</l>
     <l n="128">The wanton maids were all for sport a-bed .</l>
     <l n="129">Some said the sex were pleased with handsome lies ,</l>
     <l n="130">And some gross flattery loved without disguise .</l>
     <l n="131">Truth is , says one , he seldom fails to win</l>
     <l n="132">Who flatters well ; for that 's our darling sin .</l>
     <l n="133">But long attendance , and a duteous mind ,</l>
     <l n="134">Will work even with the wisest of the kind .</l>
     <l n="135">One thought the sex 's prime felicity</l>
     <l n="136">Was from the bonds of wedlock to be free ;</l>
     <l n="137">Their pleasures , hours , and actions , all their own ,</l>
     <l n="138">And , uncontrouled , to give account to none .</l>
     <l n="139">Some wish a husband-fool ; but such are cursed ,</l>
     <l n="140">For fools perverse of husbands are the worst .</l>
     <l n="141">All women would be counted chaste and wise ,</l>
     <l n="142">Nor should our spouses see but with our eyes ;</l>
     <l n="143">For fools will prate ; and though they want the wit</l>
     <l n="144">To find close faults , yet open blots will hit ;</l>
     <l n="145">Though better for their ease to hold their tongue ,</l>
     <l n="146">For womankind was never in the wrong .</l>
     <l n="147">So noise ensues , and quarrels last for life ;</l>
     <l n="148">The wife abhors the fool , the fool the wife .</l>
     <l n="149">And some men say , that great delight have we</l>
     <l n="150">To be for truth extolled , and secrecy ;</l>
     <l n="151">And constant in one purpose still to dwell ,</l>
     <l n="152">And not our husbands ’ counsels to reveal .</l>
     <l n="153">But that 's a fable ; for our sex is frail ,</l>
     <l n="154">Inventing rather than not tell a tale .</l>
     <l n="155">Like leaky sieves no secrets we can hold ;</l>
     <l n="156">Witness the famous tale that Ovid told .<span corresp="#note208" type="note_anchor">[ 208 ]</span></l>
     <l n="157">Midas the king , as in his book appears ,</l>
     <l n="158">By Phoebus was endowed with asses ears ,</l>
     <l n="159">Which under his long locks he well concealed ,</l>
     <l n="160">( As monarchs ’ vices must not be revealed ,)</l>
     <l n="161">For fear the people have them in the wind ,</l>
     <l n="162">Who , long ago , were neither dumb nor blind ;</l>
     <l n="163">Nor apt to think from heaven their title springs ,</l>
     <l n="164">Since Jove and Mars left off begetting kings .</l>
     <l n="165">This Midas knew ; and durst communicate</l>
     <l n="166">To none but to his wife his ears of state ;</l>
     <l n="167">One must be trusted , and he thought her fit ,</l>
     <l n="168">As passing prudent , and a parlous wit .</l>
     <l n="169">To this sagacious confessor he went ,</l>
     <l n="170">And told her what a gift the gods had sent ;</l>
     <l n="171">But told it under matrimonial seal ,</l>
     <l n="172">With strict injunction never to reveal .</l>
     <l n="173">The secret heard , she plighted him her troth ,</l>
     <l n="174">( And sacred sure is every woman 's oath ,)</l>
     <l n="175">The royal malady should rest unknown ,</l>
     <l n="176">Both for her husband 's honour and her own :</l>
     <l n="177">But ne'ertheless she pined with discontent ,</l>
     <l n="178">The counsel rumbled till it found a vent .</l>
     <l n="179">The thing she knew she was obliged to hide ; }</l>
     <l n="180">By interest and by oath the wife was tied , }</l>
     <l n="181">But , if she told it not , the woman died . }</l>
     <l n="182">Loth to betray a husband and a prince , }</l>
     <l n="183">But she must burst or blab , and no pretence }</l>
     <l n="184">Of honour tied her tongue from self-defence . }</l>
     <l n="185">A marshy ground commodiously was near ,</l>
     <l n="186">Thither she ran , and held her breath for fear ,</l>
     <l n="187">Lest if a word she spoke of any thing ,</l>
     <l n="188">That word might be the secret of the king .</l>
     <l n="189">Thus full of counsel to the fen she went ,</l>
     <l n="190">Griped all the way , and longing for a vent ;</l>
     <l n="191">Arrived , by pure necessity compelled ,</l>
     <l n="192">On her majestic marrow-bones she kneeled :</l>
     <l n="193">Then to the water 's brink she laid her head ,</l>
     <l n="194">And as a bittour bumps<span corresp="#note209" type="note_anchor">[ 209 ]</span>within a reed ,—</l>
     <l n="195">To thee alone , O lake ! she said , I tell ,</l>
     <l n="196">( And , as thy queen , command thee to conceal :)</l>
     <l n="197">Beneath his locks , the king my husband wears</l>
     <l n="198">A goodly royal pair of asses ears :</l>
     <l n="199">Now I have eased my bosom of the pain ,</l>
     <l n="200">Till the next longing fit return again .—</l>
     <l n="201">Thus through a woman was the secret known ;</l>
     <l n="202">Tell us , and , in effect , you tell the town .</l>
     <l n="203">But to my tale : The knight , with heavy cheer ,</l>
     <l n="204">Wandering in vain , had now consumed the year ;</l>
     <l n="205">One day was only left to solve the doubt ,</l>
     <l n="206">Yet knew no more than when he first set out .</l>
     <l n="207">But home he must ; and , as the award had been ,</l>
     <l n="208">Yield up his body captive to the queen .</l>
     <l n="209">In this despairing state he hap 'd to ride ,</l>
     <l n="210">As fortune led him , by a forest side ;</l>
     <l n="211">Lonely the vale , and full of horror stood ,</l>
     <l n="212">Brown with the shade of a religious wood ;</l>
     <l n="213">When full before him , at the noon of night ,</l>
     <l n="214">( The moon was up , and shot a gleamy light ,)</l>
     <l n="215">He saw a quire of ladies in a round ,</l>
     <l n="216">That featly footing seemed to skim the ground .</l>
     <l n="217">Thus dancing hand in hand , so light they were ,</l>
     <l n="218">He knew not where they trod , on earth or air .</l>
     <l n="219">At speed he drove , and came a sudden guest ; }</l>
     <l n="220">In hope , where many women were , at least }</l>
     <l n="221">Some one , by chance , might answer his request . }</l>
     <l n="222">But faster than his horse the ladies flew ,</l>
     <l n="223">And in a trice were vanished out of view .</l>
     <l n="224">One only hag remained ; but fouler far</l>
     <l n="225">Than grandame apes in Indian forests are ;</l>
     <l n="226">Against a withered oak she leaned her weight , }</l>
     <l n="227">Propped on her trusty staff , not half upright , }</l>
     <l n="228">And dropped an awkward courtesy to the knight . }</l>
     <l n="229">Then said , What makes you , sir , so late abroad</l>
     <l n="230">Without a guide , and this no beaten road ?</l>
     <l n="231">Or want you aught that here you hope to find ,</l>
     <l n="232">Or travel for some trouble in your mind ?</l>
     <l n="233">The last I guess ; and if I read aright ,</l>
     <l n="234">Those of our sex are bound to serve a knight .</l>
     <l n="235">Perhaps good counsel may your grief assuage ,</l>
     <l n="236">Then tell your pain , for wisdom is in age .—</l>
     <l n="237">To this the knight : Good mother , would you know</l>
     <l n="238">The secret cause and spring of all my woe ?</l>
     <l n="239">My life must with to-morrow 's light expire ,</l>
     <l n="240">Unless I tell what women most desire .</l>
     <l n="241">Now could you help me at this hard essay ,</l>
     <l n="242">Or for your inborn goodness , or for pay ,</l>
     <l n="243">Yours is my life , redeemed by your advice ,</l>
     <l n="244">Ask what you please , and I will pay the price :</l>
     <l n="245">The proudest kerchief of the court shall rest</l>
     <l n="246">Well satisfied of what they love the best .—</l>
     <l n="247">Plight me thy faith , quoth she , that what I ask ,</l>
     <l n="248">Thy danger over , and performed the task ,</l>
     <l n="249">That shalt thou give for hire of thy demand ,</l>
     <l n="250">( Here take thy oath , and seal it on my hand ,)</l>
     <l n="251">I warrant thee , on peril of my life ,</l>
     <l n="252">Thy words shall please both widow , maid , and wife .—</l>
     <l n="253">More words there needed not to move the knight ,</l>
     <l n="254">To take her offer , and his truth to plight .</l>
     <l n="255">With that she spread her mantle on the ground ,</l>
     <l n="256">And , first inquiring whither he was bound ,</l>
     <l n="257">Bade him not fear , though long and rough the way ,</l>
     <l n="258">At court he should arrive ere break of day :</l>
     <l n="259">His horse should find the way without a guide , }</l>
     <l n="260">She said : with fury they began to ride , }</l>
     <l n="261">He on the midst , the beldam at his side . }</l>
     <l n="262">The horse , what devil drove I cannot tell ,</l>
     <l n="263">But only this , they sped their journey well ;</l>
     <l n="264">And all the way the crone informed the knight ,</l>
     <l n="265">How he should answer the demand aright .</l>
     <l n="266">To court they came ; the news was quickly spread</l>
     <l n="267">Of his returning to redeem his head .</l>
     <l n="268">The female senate was assembled soon ,</l>
     <l n="269">With all the mob of women in the town :</l>
     <l n="270">The queen sat lord chief-justice of the hall ,</l>
     <l n="271">And bade the crier cite the criminal .</l>
     <l n="272">The knight appeared , and silence they proclaim :</l>
     <l n="273">Then first the culprit answered to his name ;</l>
     <l n="274">And , after forms of law , was last required</l>
     <l n="275">To name the thing that women most desired .—</l>
     <l n="276">The offender , taught his lesson by the way ,</l>
     <l n="277">And by his counsel ordered what to say ,</l>
     <l n="278">Thus bold began :— My lady liege , said he ,</l>
     <l n="279">What all your sex desire is — SOVEREIGNTY .</l>
     <l n="280">The wife affects her husband to command ;</l>
     <l n="281">All must be her 's , both money , house , and land :</l>
     <l n="282">The maids are mistresses even in their name ,</l>
     <l n="283">And of their servants full dominion claim .</l>
     <l n="284">This , at the peril of my head , I say , }</l>
     <l n="285">A blunt plain truth , the sex aspires to sway , }</l>
     <l n="286">You to rule all , while we , like slaves , obey .— }</l>
     <l n="287">There was not one , or widow , maid , or wife ,</l>
     <l n="288">But said the knight had well deserved his life .</l>
     <l n="289">Even fair Geneura , with a blush , confessed ,</l>
     <l n="290">The man had found what women love the best .</l>
     <l n="291">Up starts the beldam , who was there unseen ,</l>
     <l n="292">And , reverence made , accosted thus the queen :—</l>
     <l n="293">My liege , said she , before the court arise ,</l>
     <l n="294">May I , poor wretch , find favour in your eyes ,</l>
     <l n="295">To grant my just request : ‘ twas I who taught</l>
     <l n="296">The knight this answer , and inspired his thought .</l>
     <l n="297">None but a woman could a man direct</l>
     <l n="298">To tell us women what we most affect .</l>
     <l n="299">But first I swore him on his knightly troth ,</l>
     <l n="300">( And here demand performance of his oath ,)</l>
     <l n="301">To grant the boon that next I should desire ;</l>
     <l n="302">He gave his faith , and I expect my hire .</l>
     <l n="303">My promise is fulfilled : I saved his life ,</l>
     <l n="304">And claim his debt , to take me for his wife .—</l>
     <l n="305">The knight was asked , nor could his oath deny ,</l>
     <l n="306">But hoped they would not force him to comply .</l>
     <l n="307">The women , who would rather wrest the laws ,</l>
     <l n="308">Than let a sister-plaintiff lose the cause ,</l>
     <l n="309">( As judges on the bench more gracious are ,</l>
     <l n="310">And more attent to brothers of the bar ,)</l>
     <l n="311">Cried one and all , the suppliant should have right ,</l>
     <l n="312">And to the grandame hag adjudged the knight .</l>
     <l n="313">In vain he sighed , and oft with tears desired ,</l>
     <l n="314">Some reasonable suit might be required .</l>
     <l n="315">But still the crone was constant to her note ;</l>
     <l n="316">The more he spoke , the more she stretched her throat .</l>
     <l n="317">In vain he proffered all his goods , to save</l>
     <l n="318">His body , destined to that living grave .</l>
     <l n="319">The liquorish hag rejects the pelf with scorn ,</l>
     <l n="320">And nothing but the man would serve her turn .</l>
     <l n="321">Not all the wealth of eastern kings , said she ,</l>
     <l n="322">Has power to part my plighted love , and me ;</l>
     <l n="323">And , old and ugly as I am , and poor ,</l>
     <l n="324">Yet never will I break the faith I swore ;</l>
     <l n="325">For mine thou art by promise , during life ,</l>
     <l n="326">And I thy loving and obedient wife .—</l>
     <l n="327">My love ! nay rather my damnation thou ,</l>
     <l n="328">Said he : nor am I bound to keep my vow ;</l>
     <l n="329">The fiend thy sire has sent thee from below ,</l>
     <l n="330">Else how couldst thou my secret sorrows know ?</l>
     <l n="331">Avaunt , old witch , for I renounce thy bed : }</l>
     <l n="332">The queen may take the forfeit of my head , }</l>
     <l n="333">Ere any of my race so foul a crone shall wed .— }</l>
     <l n="334">Both heard , the judge pronounced against the knight ;</l>
     <l n="335">So was he married in his own despite :</l>
     <l n="336">And all day after hid him as an owl ,</l>
     <l n="337">Not able to sustain a sight so foul .</l>
     <l n="338">Perhaps the reader thinks I do him wrong ,</l>
     <l n="339">To pass the marriage-feast , and nuptial song :</l>
     <l n="340">Mirth there was none , the man was a-la-mort ,</l>
     <l n="341">And little courage had to make his court .</l>
     <l n="342">To bed they went , the bridegroom and the bride :</l>
     <l n="343">Was never such an ill-paired couple tied !</l>
     <l n="344">Restless he tossed , and tumbled to and fro ,</l>
     <l n="345">And rolled , and wriggled further off , for woe .</l>
     <l n="346">The good old wife lay smiling by his side ,</l>
     <l n="347">And caught him in her quivering arms , and cried ,—</l>
     <l n="348">When you my ravished predecessor saw , }</l>
     <l n="349">You were not then become this man of straw ; }</l>
     <l n="350">Had you been such , you might have ‘ scaped the law . }</l>
     <l n="351">Is this the custom of king Arthur 's court ?</l>
     <l n="352">Are all round-table knights of such a sort ?</l>
     <l n="353">Remember I am she who saved your life ,</l>
     <l n="354">Your loving , lawful , and complying wife :</l>
     <l n="355">Not thus you swore in your unhappy hour ,</l>
     <l n="356">Nor I for this return employed my power .</l>
     <l n="357">In time of need I was your faithful friend ;</l>
     <l n="358">Nor did I since , nor ever will offend .</l>
     <l n="359">Believe me , my loved lord , ‘ tis much unkind ;</l>
     <l n="360">What fury has possessed your altered mind ?</l>
     <l n="361">Thus on my wedding-night — without pretence —</l>
     <l n="362">Come turn this way , or tell me my offence .</l>
     <l n="363">If not your wife , let reason 's rule persuade ;</l>
     <l n="364">Name but my fault , amends shall soon be made .—</l>
     <l n="365">Amends ! nay that 's impossible , said he ,</l>
     <l n="366">What change of age or ugliness can be ?</l>
     <l n="367">Or could Medea 's magic mend thy face ,</l>
     <l n="368">Thou art descended from so mean a race , }</l>
     <l n="369">That never knight was matched with such disgrace . }</l>
     <l n="370">What wonder , madam , if I move my side , }</l>
     <l n="371">When , if I turn , I turn to such a bride ?—</l>
     <l n="372">And is this all that troubles you so sore ?—</l>
     <l n="373">And what the devil couldst thou wish me more ?—</l>
     <l n="374">Ah Benedicite ! replied the crone :</l>
     <l n="375">Then cause of just complaining have you none .</l>
     <l n="376">The remedy to this were soon applied ,</l>
     <l n="377">Would you be like the bridegroom to the bride :</l>
     <l n="378">But , for you say a long-descended race ,</l>
     <l n="379">And wealth and dignity , and power , and place ,</l>
     <l n="380">Make gentlemen , and that your high degree</l>
     <l n="381">Is much disparaged to be matched with me ,—</l>
     <l n="382">Know this , my lord , nobility of blood</l>
     <l n="383">Is but a glittering and fallacious good :</l>
     <l n="384">The nobleman is he , whose noble mind</l>
     <l n="385">Is filled with inborn worth , unborrowed from his kind .</l>
     <l n="386">The King of Heaven was in a manger laid ,</l>
     <l n="387">And took his earth but from an humble maid :</l>
     <l n="388">Then what can birth , or mortal men , bestow ,</l>
     <l n="389">Since floods no higher than their fountains flow ?</l>
     <l n="390">We , who for name and empty honour strive ,</l>
     <l n="391">Our true nobility from him derive .</l>
     <l n="392">Your ancestors , who puff your mind with pride ,</l>
     <l n="393">And vast estates to mighty titles tied ,</l>
     <l n="394">Did not your honour , but their own , advance ;</l>
     <l n="395">For virtue comes not by inheritance .</l>
     <l n="396">If you tralineate from your father 's mind ,</l>
     <l n="397">What are you else but of a bastard-kind ?</l>
     <l n="398">Do , as your great progenitors have done ,</l>
     <l n="399">And by their virtues prove yourself their son .</l>
     <l n="400">No father can infuse , or wit , or grace ;</l>
     <l n="401">A mother comes across , and mars the race .</l>
     <l n="402">A grandsire or a grandame taints the blood ;</l>
     <l n="403">And seldom three descents continue good .</l>
     <l n="404">Were virtue by descent , a noble name</l>
     <l n="405">Could never villanize his father 's fame ;</l>
     <l n="406">But , as the first , the last of all the line ,</l>
     <l n="407">Would , like the sun , even in descending shine .</l>
     <l n="408">Take fire , and bear it to the darkest house ,</l>
     <l n="409">Betwixt king Arthur 's court and Caucasus ,</l>
     <l n="410">If you depart , the flame shall still remain ,</l>
     <l n="411">And the bright blaze enlighten all the plain ;</l>
     <l n="412">Nor , till the fuel perish , can decay ,</l>
     <l n="413">By nature formed on things combustible to prey .</l>
     <l n="414">Such is not man , who , mixing better seed</l>
     <l n="415">With worse , begets a base degenerate breed .</l>
     <l n="416">The bad corrupts the good , and leaves behind</l>
     <l n="417">No trace of all the great begetter 's mind .</l>
     <l n="418">The father sinks within his son , we see ,</l>
     <l n="419">And often rises in the third degree ;</l>
     <l n="420">If better luck a better mother give ,</l>
     <l n="421">Chance gave us being , and by chance we live .</l>
     <l n="422">Such as our atoms were , even such are we , }</l>
     <l n="423">Or call it chance , or strong necessity : }</l>
     <l n="424">Thus loaded with dead weight , the will is free . }</l>
     <l n="425">And thus it needs must be ; for seed conjoined</l>
     <l n="426">Lets into nature 's work the imperfect kind ;</l>
     <l n="427">But fire , the enlivener of the general frame ,</l>
     <l n="428">Is one , its operation still the same .</l>
     <l n="429">Its principle is in itself : while ours</l>
     <l n="430">Works , as confederates war , with mingled powers ;</l>
     <l n="431">Or man or woman , which soever fails ;</l>
     <l n="432">And , oft , the vigour of the worse prevails .</l>
     <l n="433">Æther , with sulphur blended , alters hue ,</l>
     <l n="434">And casts a dusky gleam of Sodom blue .</l>
     <l n="435">Thus , in a brute , their ancient honour ends ,</l>
     <l n="436">And the fair mermaid in a fish descends :</l>
     <l n="437">The line is gone ; no longer duke or earl ;</l>
     <l n="438">But , by himself degraded , turns a churl .</l>
     <l n="439">Nobility of blood is but renown }</l>
     <l n="440">Of thy great fathers by their virtue known , }</l>
     <l n="441">And a long trail of light , to thee descending down . }</l>
     <l n="442">If in thy smoke it ends , their glories shine ;</l>
     <l n="443">But infamy and villanage are thine .</l>
     <l n="444">Then what I said before is plainly showed ,</l>
     <l n="445">That true nobility proceeds from God :</l>
     <l n="446">Not left us by inheritance , but given</l>
     <l n="447">By bounty of our stars , and grace of heaven .</l>
     <l n="448">Thus from a captive Servius Tullius rose ,</l>
     <l n="449">Whom for his virtues the first Romans chose .</l>
     <l n="450">Fabricius from their walls repelled the foe ,</l>
     <l n="451">Whose noble hands had exercised the plough .</l>
     <l n="452">From hence , my lord , and love , I thus conclude ,</l>
     <l n="453">That , though my homely ancestors were rude ,</l>
     <l n="454">Mean as I am , yet I may have the grace</l>
     <l n="455">To make you father of a generous race .</l>
     <l n="456">And noble then am I , when I begin ,</l>
     <l n="457">In virtue clothed , to cast the rags of sin .</l>
     <l n="458">If poverty be my upbraided crime ,</l>
     <l n="459">And you believe in heaven , there was a time</l>
     <l n="460">When he , the great controller of our fate ,</l>
     <l n="461">Deigned to be man , and lived in low estate ;</l>
     <l n="462">Which he who had the world at his dispose ,</l>
     <l n="463">If poverty were vice , would never choose .</l>
     <l n="464">Philosophers have said , and poets sing ,</l>
     <l n="465">That a glad poverty 's an honest thing ;</l>
     <l n="466">Content is wealth , the riches of the mind ,</l>
     <l n="467">And happy he who can that treasure find ;</l>
     <l n="468">But the base miser starves amidst his store , }</l>
     <l n="469">Broods on his gold , and , griping still at more , }</l>
     <l n="470">Sits sadly pining , and believes he 's poor ; }</l>
     <l n="471">The ragged beggar , though he wants relief ,</l>
     <l n="472">Has not to lose , and sings before the thief .<span corresp="#note210" type="note_anchor">[ 210 ]</span></l>
     <l n="473">Want is a bitter and a hateful good ,</l>
     <l n="474">Because its virtues are not understood .</l>
     <l n="475">Yet many things , impossible to thought ,</l>
     <l n="476">Have been , by need , to full perfection brought :</l>
     <l n="477">The daring of the soul proceeds from thence ,</l>
     <l n="478">Sharpness of wit , and active diligence ;</l>
     <l n="479">Prudence at once , and fortitude , it gives ,</l>
     <l n="480">And , if in patience taken , mends our lives ;</l>
     <l n="481">For even that indigence , that brings me low ,</l>
     <l n="482">Makes me myself , and him above , to know ;</l>
     <l n="483">A good which none would challenge , few would choose ,</l>
     <l n="484">A fair possession , which mankind refuse .</l>
     <l n="485">If we from wealth to poverty descend ,</l>
     <l n="486">Want gives to know the flatterer from the friend .</l>
     <l n="487">If I am old and ugly , well for you ,</l>
     <l n="488">No lewd adulterer will my love pursue ;</l>
     <l n="489">Nor jealousy , the bane of married life ,</l>
     <l n="490">Shall haunt you for a withered homely wife ;</l>
     <l n="491">For age and ugliness , as all agree ,</l>
     <l n="492">Are the best guards of female chastity .</l>
     <l n="493">Yet since I see your mind is worldly bent ,</l>
     <l n="494">I 'll do my best to further your content ;</l>
     <l n="495">And therefore of two gifts in my dispose ,—</l>
     <l n="496">Think ere you speak ,— I grant you leave to choose :</l>
     <l n="497">Would you I should be still deformed and old ,</l>
     <l n="498">Nauseous to touch , and loathsome to behold ;</l>
     <l n="499">On this condition , to remain for life</l>
     <l n="500">A careful , tender , and obedient wife ,</l>
     <l n="501">In all I can contribute to your ease ,</l>
     <l n="502">And not in deed , or word , or thought displease ?</l>
     <l n="503">Or would you rather have me young and fair ,</l>
     <l n="504">And take the chance that happens to your share ?</l>
     <l n="505">Temptations are in beauty , and in youth .</l>
     <l n="506">And how can you depend upon my truth ?</l>
     <l n="507">Now weigh the danger with the doubtful bliss ,</l>
     <l n="508">And thank yourself , if aught should fall amiss ,—</l>
     <l n="509">Sore sighed the knight , who this long sermon heard ;</l>
     <l n="510">At length considering all , his heart he cheered ,</l>
     <l n="511">And thus replied :— My lady , and my wife ,</l>
     <l n="512">To your wise conduct I resign my life :</l>
     <l n="513">Choose you for me , for well you understand</l>
     <l n="514">The future good and ill , on either hand :</l>
     <l n="515">But if an humble husband may request ,</l>
     <l n="516">Provide , and order all things for the best ;</l>
     <l n="517">Your 's be the care to profit , and to please ,</l>
     <l n="518">And let your subject-servant take his ease .—</l>
     <l n="519">Then thus in peace , quoth she , concludes the strife ,</l>
     <l n="520">Since I am turned the husband , you the wife :</l>
     <l n="521">The matrimonial victory is mine ,</l>
     <l n="522">Which , having fairly gained , I will resign ;</l>
     <l n="523">Forgive , if I have said or done amiss ,</l>
     <l n="524">And seal the bargain with a friendly kiss .</l>
     <l n="525">I promised you but one content to share ,</l>
     <l n="526">But now I will become both good and fair .</l>
     <l n="527">No nuptial quarrel shall disturb your ease ;</l>
     <l n="528">The business of my life shall be to please :</l>
     <l n="529">And for my beauty , that , as time shall try ;</l>
     <l n="530">But draw the curtain first , and cast your eye .—</l>
     <l n="531">He looked , and saw a creature heavenly fair ,</l>
     <l n="532">In bloom of youth , and of a charming air .</l>
     <l n="533">With joy he turned , and seized her ivory arm ;</l>
     <l n="534">And , like Pygmalion , found the statue warm .</l>
     <l n="535">Small arguments there needed to prevail ,</l>
     <l n="536">A storm of kisses poured as thick as hail .</l>
     <l n="537">Thus long in mutual bliss they lay embraced ,</l>
     <l n="538">And their first love continued to the last ;</l>
     <l n="539">One sunshine was their life , no cloud between ,</l>
     <l n="540">Nor ever was a kinder couple seen .</l>
     <l n="541">And so may all our lives like their 's be led ;</l>
     <l n="542">Heaven send the maids young husbands fresh in bed !</l>
     <l n="543">May widows wed as often as they can ,</l>
     <l n="544">And ever for the better change their man .</l>
     <l n="545">And some devouring plague pursue their lives ,</l>
     <l n="546">Who will not well be governed by their wives .</l>

   <p>This beautiful copy of a beautiful original makes us regret , that Dryden had not translated the whole Introduction to the “ Canterbury Tales , ” in which the pilgrims are so admirably described . Something might have been lost for want of the ancient Gothic lore , which the writers of our poet 's period did not think proper to study ; but when Dryden 's learning failed , his native stores of fancy and numbers would have helped him through the task .</p>
   <p>“ The Character of the Good Priest ” may be considered as an amende honorable to the reverend order whom Dryden had often satirized , and he himself seems to wish it to be viewed in that light . See Preface , p. 225 . With a freedom which he has frequently employed elsewhere , Dryden has added the last forty lines , in which , availing himself of the Revolution , which in Chaucer 's time placed Henry IV . on the throne , he represents the political principles of his priest as the same with those of the non-juring clergy of his own day . Indeed , the whole piece is greatly enlarged upon Chaucer 's sketch .</p>

    <head>THE</head>
    <head>CHARACTER</head>
    <head>OF</head>
    <head>A GOOD PARSON .</head>
     <l n="1">A parish priest was of the pilgrim train ;</l>
     <l n="2">An awful , reverend , and religious man .</l>
     <l n="3">His eyes diffused a venerable grace ,</l>
     <l n="4">And charity itself was in his face .</l>
     <l n="5">Rich was his soul , though his attire was poor , }</l>
     <l n="6">( As God had clothed his own ambassador ;) }</l>
     <l n="7">For such on earth his blessed Redeemer bore . }</l>
     <l n="8">Of sixty years he seemed , and well might last</l>
     <l n="9">To sixty more , but that he lived too fast ;</l>
     <l n="10">Refined himself to soul , to curb the sense ,</l>
     <l n="11">And made almost a sin of abstinence .</l>
     <l n="12">Yet had his aspect nothing of severe ,</l>
     <l n="13">But such a face as promised him sincere ;</l>
     <l n="14">Nothing reserved or sullen was to see ,</l>
     <l n="15">But sweet regards , and pleasing sanctity ;</l>
     <l n="16">Mild was his accent , and his action free .</l>
     <l n="17">With eloquence innate his tongue was armed ,</l>
     <l n="18">Though harsh the precept , yet the preacher charmed .</l>
     <l n="19">For , letting down the golden chain from high ,</l>
     <l n="20">He drew his audience upward to the sky ;</l>
     <l n="21">And oft , with holy hymns , he charmed their ears ,</l>
     <l n="22">( A music more melodious than the spheres ,)</l>
     <l n="23">For David left him , when he went to rest ,</l>
     <l n="24">His lyre ; and after him he sung the best .</l>
     <l n="25">He bore his great commission in his look ,</l>
     <l n="26">But sweetly tempered awe , and softened all he spoke .</l>
     <l n="27">He preached the joys of heaven , and pains of hell , }</l>
     <l n="28">And warned the sinner with becoming zeal ; }</l>
     <l n="29">But on eternal mercy loved to dwell . }</l>
     <l n="30">He taught the gospel rather than the law ,</l>
     <l n="31">And forced himself to drive , but loved to draw .</l>
     <l n="32">For fear but freezes minds ; but love , like heat ,</l>
     <l n="33">Exhales the soul sublime , to seek her native seat .</l>
     <l n="34">To threats the stubborn sinner oft is hard ,</l>
     <l n="35">Wrapped in his crimes , against the storm prepared ;</l>
     <l n="36">But when the milder beams of mercy play ,</l>
     <l n="37">He melts , and throws his cumbrous cloak away .</l>
     <l n="38">Lightnings and thunder , ( heaven 's artillery ,)</l>
     <l n="39">As harbingers before the Almighty fly :</l>
     <l n="40">Those but proclaim his style , and disappear ;</l>
     <l n="41">The stiller sound succeeds , and God is there .</l>
     <l n="42">The tithes , his parish freely paid , he took ,</l>
     <l n="43">But never sued , or cursed with bell and book ;</l>
     <l n="44">With patience bearing wrong , but offering none ,</l>
     <l n="45">Since every man is free to lose his own .</l>
     <l n="46">The country churls , according to their kind ,</l>
     <l n="47">( Who grudge their dues , and love to be behind ,)</l>
     <l n="48">The less he sought his offerings , pinched the more ,</l>
     <l n="49">And praised a priest contented to be poor .</l>
     <l n="50">Yet of his little he had some to spare ,</l>
     <l n="51">To feed the famished , and to clothe the bare ;</l>
     <l n="52">For mortified he was to that degree ,</l>
     <l n="53">A poorer than himself he would not see .</l>
     <l n="54">True priests , he said , and preachers of the word ,</l>
     <l n="55">Were only stewards of their sovereign Lord ;</l>
     <l n="56">Nothing was theirs , but all the public store ;</l>
     <l n="57">Intrusted riches , to relieve the poor ;</l>
     <l n="58">Who , should they steal , for want of his relief ,</l>
     <l n="59">He judged himself accomplice with the thief .</l>
     <l n="60">Wide was his parish ; not contracted close</l>
     <l n="61">In streets , but here and there a straggling house ;</l>
     <l n="62">Yet still he was at hand , without request ,</l>
     <l n="63">To serve the sick , to succour the distressed ;</l>
     <l n="64">Tempting on foot alone , without affright ,</l>
     <l n="65">The dangers of a dark tempestuous night .</l>
     <l n="66">All this , the good old man performed alone ,</l>
     <l n="67">Nor spared his pains ; for curate he had none .</l>
     <l n="68">Nor durst he trust another with his care ;</l>
     <l n="69">Nor rode himself to Paul 's , the public fair ,</l>
     <l n="70">To chaffer for preferment with his gold ,</l>
     <l n="71">Where bishoprics and sinecures are sold ;</l>
     <l n="72">But duly watched his flock by night and day , }</l>
     <l n="73">And from the prowling wolf redeemed the prey , }</l>
     <l n="74">And hungry sent the wily fox away . }</l>
     <l n="75">The proud he tamed , the penitent he cheered ;</l>
     <l n="76">Nor to rebuke the rich offender feared .</l>
     <l n="77">His preaching much , but more his practice wrought ;</l>
     <l n="78">( A living sermon of the truths he taught ;)</l>
     <l n="79">For this by rules severe his life he squared ,</l>
     <l n="80">That all might see the doctrine which they heard .</l>
     <l n="81">For priests , he said , are patterns for the rest ;</l>
     <l n="82">( The gold of heaven , who bear the God impressed ;)</l>
     <l n="83">But when the precious coin is kept unclean ,</l>
     <l n="84">The Sovereign 's image is no longer seen .</l>
     <l n="85">If they be foul on whom the people trust ,</l>
     <l n="86">Well may the baser brass contract a rust .</l>
     <l n="87">The prelate , for his holy life he prized ;</l>
     <l n="88">The worldly pomp of prelacy despised ;</l>
     <l n="89">His Saviour came not with a gaudy show ,</l>
     <l n="90">Nor was his kingdom of the world below .</l>
     <l n="91">Patience in want , and poverty of mind , }</l>
     <l n="92">These marks of church and churchmen he designed , }</l>
     <l n="93">And living taught , and dying left behind . }</l>
     <l n="94">The crown he wore was of the pointed thorn ;</l>
     <l n="95">In purple he was crucified , not born .</l>
     <l n="96">They , who contend for place and high degree ,</l>
     <l n="97">Are not his sons , but those of Zebedee .</l>
     <l n="98">Not but he knew the signs of earthly power</l>
     <l n="99">Might well become Saint Peter 's successor ;</l>
     <l n="100">The Holy Father holds a double reign ,</l>
     <l n="101">The prince may keep his pomp , the fisher must be plain .<span corresp="#note211" type="note_anchor">[ 211 ]</span></l>
     <l n="102">Such was the saint , who shone with every grace ,</l>
     <l n="103">Reflecting , Moses-like , his Maker 's face .</l>
     <l n="104">God saw his image lively was expressed ;</l>
     <l n="105">And his own work , as in creation , blessed .</l>
     <l n="106">The tempter saw him too with envious eye ,</l>
     <l n="107">And , as on Job , demanded leave to try .</l>
     <l n="108">He took the time when Richard was deposed ,</l>
     <l n="109">And high and low with happy Harry closed .</l>
     <l n="110">This prince , though great in arms , the priest withstood :</l>
     <l n="111">Near though he was , yet not the next of blood .</l>
     <l n="112">Had Richard , unconstrained , resigned the throne , }</l>
     <l n="113">A king can give no more than is his own : }</l>
     <l n="114">The title stood entailed , had Richard had a son . }</l>
     <l n="115">Conquest , an odious name , was laid aside ;</l>
     <l n="116">Where all submitted , none the battle tried .</l>
     <l n="117">The senseless plea of right by Providence</l>
     <l n="118">Was , by a flattering priest , invented since ;</l>
     <l n="119">And lasts no longer than the present sway ,</l>
     <l n="120">But justifies the next who comes in play .</l>
     <l n="121">The people 's right remains ; let those who dare</l>
     <l n="122">Dispute their power , when they the judges are .</l>
     <l n="123">He joined not in their choice , because he knew</l>
     <l n="124">Worse might , and often did , from change ensue .</l>
     <l n="125">Much to himself he thought , but little spoke ;</l>
     <l n="126">And , undeprived , his benefice forsook .</l>
     <l n="127">Now , through the land , his cure of souls he stretched ,</l>
     <l n="128">And like a primitive apostle preached .</l>
     <l n="129">Still cheerful ; ever constant to his call ;</l>
     <l n="130">By many followed ; loved by most , admired by all .</l>
     <l n="131">With what he begged , his brethren he relieved ,</l>
     <l n="132">And gave the charities himself received ;</l>
     <l n="133">Gave , while he taught ; and edified the more ,</l>
     <l n="134">Because he shewed , by proof , ‘ twas easy to be poor .</l>
     <l n="135">He went not , with the crowd , to see a shrine ;</l>
     <l n="136">But fed us , by the way , with food divine .</l>
     <l n="137">In deference to his virtues , I forbear</l>
     <l n="138">To shew you what the rest in orders were :</l>

   <p>FABLES .</p>
   <p>TRANSLATIONS FROM BOCCACE .</p>
   <p>SIGISMONDA AND GUISCARDO .</p>
   <p>This celebrated tale was probably taken by Boccacio from some ancient chronicle or traditional legend . It excited great attention among the learned of his time , and was translated into Latin by Leonardo Aretino . Francesco di Michele Accolti de Arezzo , who was accounted one of the best civilians of his age , rendered into Italian verse the lamentation of Sigismonda over her lover 's heart ; and the learned Philip Beroald made a Latin poetical version of the whole fable . Translations and imitations without number have been executed in foreign languages , without mentioning the tragedies which have been founded upon it . In England , the story was translated and versified in the octave stanza by William Walter , a follower of Sir Henry Marney , chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster .<span corresp="#note212" type="note_anchor">[ 212 ]</span>A prose translation is to be found in Painter 's “ Palace of Pleasure ; ” and the tale being wrought into a tragedy by Robert Wilmot and others , was presented before Queen Elizabeth , at the Inner Temple , in 1568 .<span corresp="#note213" type="note_anchor">[ 213 ]</span>Dryden will not readily be suspected of deriving much aid from his black-lettered predecessors . He made Boccacio 's story his own , and told it in his own way . One gross fault he has engrafted upon his original ; I mean the coarseness of Sigismonda 's character , whose love is that of temperament , not of affection . This error , grounded upon Dryden 's false view of the passion and of the female character , and perhaps arising from the depravity of the age rather than of the poet , pervades and greatly injures the effect of the tale . Yet it is more than counterbalanced by preponderating beauties . Without repeating the praise , elsewhere given to the majesty of the poet 's versification , and which this piece alone would be sufficient to justify , the reader 's attention may be solicited to the colours with which Dryden has drawn a mind wrought up to the highest pitch of despair . Sigismonda is placed in that situation , in which , above all others , the human disposition seems to acquire a sort of supernatural strength or obstinacy : for although guilty of a crime , she is punished in a degree far exceeding the measure of the offence . In such a situation , that acuteness of feeling , which would otherwise waste itself in fluctuations betwixt shame , fear , and remorse , is willingly and eagerly turned into the channel of resistance and recrimination ; and perhaps no readier mode can be discovered of hardening the human heart , even to the consistence of the nether millstone . It is in this state , that Sigismonda resolutely , and even joyfully , embraces death , in order to punish her father , and rejoin her lover . The previous arguments with Tancred , sufficiently , and , in the circumstances , naturally , intimate the tone of her mind , and are a striking instance of Dryden 's power in painting passion wrought up to desperation .</p>
   <p>The scene is laid in the middle ages , when the principality of Salerno was ruled by a dynasty of Norman princes , deriving their family from the celebrated Robert de Guiscard .</p>

    <head>SIGISMONDA</head>
    <head>AND</head>
    <head>GUISCARDO .</head>
     <l n="1">While Norman Tancred in Salerno reigned ,</l>
     <l n="2">The title of a gracious prince he gained ;</l>
     <l n="3">Till turned a tyrant in his latter days ,</l>
     <l n="4">He lost the lustre of his former praise ,</l>
     <l n="5">And , from the bright meridian where he stood</l>
     <l n="6">Descending , dipped his hands in lovers ’ blood .</l>
     <l n="7">This prince , of fortune 's favour long possessed ,</l>
     <l n="8">Yet was with one fair daughter only blessed ;</l>
     <l n="9">And blessed he might have been with her alone ,</l>
     <l n="10">But oh ! how much more happy had he none !</l>
     <l n="11">She was his care , his hope , and his delight ,</l>
     <l n="12">Most in his thought , and ever in his sight :</l>
     <l n="13">Next , nay beyond his life , he held her dear ;</l>
     <l n="14">She lived by him , and now he lived in her .</l>
     <l n="15">For this , when ripe for marriage , he delayed</l>
     <l n="16">Her nuptial bands , and kept her long a maid ,</l>
     <l n="17">As envying any else should share a part</l>
     <l n="18">Of what was his , and claiming all her heart .</l>
     <l n="19">At length , as public decency required ,</l>
     <l n="20">And all his vassals eagerly desired ,</l>
     <l n="21">With mind averse , he rather underwent</l>
     <l n="22">His people 's will , than gave his own consent .</l>
     <l n="23">So was she torn as from a lover 's side ,</l>
     <l n="24">And made , almost in his despite , a bride .</l>
     <l n="25">Short were her marriage-joys ; for in the prime</l>
     <l n="26">Of youth , her lord expired before his time ;</l>
     <l n="27">And to her father 's court in little space }</l>
     <l n="28">Restored anew , she held a higher place ; }</l>
     <l n="29">More loved , and more exalted into grace . }</l>
     <l n="30">This princess , fresh and young , and fair and wise ,</l>
     <l n="31">The worshipped idol of her father 's eyes ,</l>
     <l n="32">Did all her sex in every grace exceed ,</l>
     <l n="33">And had more wit beside than women need .</l>
     <l n="34">Youth , health , and ease , and most an amorous mind , }</l>
     <l n="35">To second nuptials had her thoughts inclined , }</l>
     <l n="36">And former joys had left a secret sting behind . }</l>
     <l n="37">But , prodigal in every other grant ,</l>
     <l n="38">Her sire left unsupplied her only want ;</l>
     <l n="39">And she , betwixt her modesty and pride ,</l>
     <l n="40">Her wishes , which she could not help , would hide .</l>
     <l n="41">Resolved at last to lose no longer time ,</l>
     <l n="42">And yet to please herself without a crime ,</l>
     <l n="43">She cast her eyes around the court , to find</l>
     <l n="44">A worthy subject suiting to her mind ,</l>
     <l n="45">To him in holy nuptials to be tied ,</l>
     <l n="46">A seeming widow , and a secret bride .</l>
     <l n="47">Among the train of courtiers , one she found</l>
     <l n="48">With all the gifts of bounteous nature crowned ;</l>
     <l n="49">Of gentle blood , but one whose niggard fate</l>
     <l n="50">Had set him far below her high estate :</l>
     <l n="51">Guiscard his name was called , of blooming age ,</l>
     <l n="52">Now squire to Tancred , and before his page :</l>
     <l n="53">To him , the choice of all the shining crowd ,</l>
     <l n="54">Her heart the noble Sigismonda vowed .</l>
     <l n="55">Yet hitherto she kept her love concealed ,</l>
     <l n="56">And with close glances every day beheld</l>
     <l n="57">The graceful youth ; and every day increased</l>
     <l n="58">The raging fire that burned within her breast :</l>
     <l n="59">Some secret charm did all his acts attend ,</l>
     <l n="60">And what his fortune wanted , hers could mend ;</l>
     <l n="61">Till , as the fire will force its outward way ,</l>
     <l n="62">Or , in the prison pent , consume the prey ,</l>
     <l n="63">So long her earnest eyes on his were set ,</l>
     <l n="64">At length their twisted rays together met ;</l>
     <l n="65">And he , surprised with humble joy , surveyed</l>
     <l n="66">One sweet regard , shot by the royal maid .</l>
     <l n="67">Not well assured , while doubtful hopes he nursed ,</l>
     <l n="68">A second glance came gliding like the first ;</l>
     <l n="69">And he , who saw the sharpness of the dart ,</l>
     <l n="70">Without defence received it in his heart .</l>
     <l n="71">In public , though their passion wanted speech ,</l>
     <l n="72">Yet mutual looks interpreted for each :</l>
     <l n="73">Time , ways , and means of meeting , were denied ;</l>
     <l n="74">But all those wants ingenious love supplied .</l>
     <l n="75">The inventive God , who never fails his part ,</l>
     <l n="76">Inspires the wit , when once he warms the heart .</l>
     <l n="77">When Guiscard next was in the circle seen ,</l>
     <l n="78">Where Sigismonda held the place of queen ,</l>
     <l n="79">A hollow cane within her hand she brought ,</l>
     <l n="80">But in the concave had inclosed a note ;</l>
     <l n="81">With this she seemed to play , and , as in sport ,</l>
     <l n="82">Tossed to her love , in presence of the court :</l>
     <l n="83">Take it , she said ; and when your needs require ,</l>
     <l n="84">This little brand will serve to light your fire .—</l>
     <l n="85">He took it with a bow , and soon divined</l>
     <l n="86">The seeming toy was not for nought designed :</l>
     <l n="87">But when retired , so long with curious eyes</l>
     <l n="88">He viewed the present , that he found the prize .</l>
     <l n="89">Much was in little writ ; and all conveyed }</l>
     <l n="90">With cautious care , for fear to be betrayed }</l>
     <l n="91">By some false confident , or favourite maid . }</l>
     <l n="92">The time , the place , the manner how to meet ,</l>
     <l n="93">Were all in punctual order plainly writ :</l>
     <l n="94">But since a trust must be , she thought it best }</l>
     <l n="95">To put it out of laymen 's power at least , }</l>
     <l n="96">And for their solemn vows prepared a priest . }</l>
     <l n="97">Guiscard ( her secret purpose understood )</l>
     <l n="98">With joy prepared to meet the coming good ;</l>
     <l n="99">Nor pains nor danger was resolved to spare ,</l>
     <l n="100">But use the means appointed by the fair .</l>
     <l n="101">Near the proud palace of Salerno stood</l>
     <l n="102">A mount of rough ascent , and thick with wood ;</l>
     <l n="103">Through this a cave was dug with vast expence ,</l>
     <l n="104">The work it seemed of some suspicious prince ,</l>
     <l n="105">Who , when abusing power with lawless might ,</l>
     <l n="106">From public justice would secure his flight .</l>
     <l n="107">The passage made by many a winding way ,</l>
     <l n="108">Reached even the room in which the tyrant lay .</l>
     <l n="109">Fit for his purpose , on a lower floor</l>
     <l n="110">He lodged , whose issue was an iron door ;</l>
     <l n="111">From whence , by stairs descending to the ground ,</l>
     <l n="112">In the blind grot a safe retreat he found .</l>
     <l n="113">Its outlet ended in a brake o'ergrown</l>
     <l n="114">With brambles , choked by time , and now unknown .</l>
     <l n="115">A rift there was , which from the mountain 's height</l>
     <l n="116">Conveyed a glimmering and malignant light ,</l>
     <l n="117">A breathing place to draw the damps away ,</l>
     <l n="118">A twilight of an intercepted day .</l>
     <l n="119">The tyrant 's den , whose use , though lost to fame ,</l>
     <l n="120">Was now the apartment of the royal dame ;</l>
     <l n="121">The cavern , only to her father known ,</l>
     <l n="122">By him was to his darling daughter shewn .</l>
     <l n="123">Neglected long she let the secret rest ,</l>
     <l n="124">Till love recalled it to her labouring breast ,</l>
     <l n="125">And hinted as the way by heaven designed ,</l>
     <l n="126">The teacher , by the means he taught , to blind .</l>
     <l n="127">What will not women do , when need inspires</l>
     <l n="128">Their wit , or love their inclination fires !</l>
     <l n="129">Though jealousy of state the invention found ,</l>
     <l n="130">Yet love refined upon the former ground .</l>
     <l n="131">That way , the tyrant had reserved to fly</l>
     <l n="132">Pursuing hate , now served to bring two lovers nigh .</l>
     <l n="133">The dame , who long in vain had kept the key ,</l>
     <l n="134">Bold by desire , explored the secret way ;</l>
     <l n="135">Now tried the stairs , and wading through the night ,</l>
     <l n="136">Searched all the deep recess , and issued into light .</l>
     <l n="137">All this her letter had so well explained ,</l>
     <l n="138">The instructed youth might compass what remained ;</l>
     <l n="139">The cavern mouth alone was hard to find ,</l>
     <l n="140">Because the path , disused , was out of mind :</l>
     <l n="141">But in what quarter of the copse it lay ,</l>
     <l n="142">His eye by certain level could survey :</l>
     <l n="143">Yet ( for the wood perplexed with thorns he knew )</l>
     <l n="144">A frock of leather o'er his limbs he drew ;<span corresp="#note214" type="note_anchor">[ 214 ]</span></l>
     <l n="145">And , thus provided , searched the brake around ,</l>
     <l n="146">Till the choked entry of the cave he found .</l>
     <l n="147">Thus , all prepared , the promised hour arrived ,</l>
     <l n="148">So long expected , and so well contrived :</l>
     <l n="149">With love to friend , the impatient lover went ,</l>
     <l n="150">Fenced from the thorns , and trod the deep descent .</l>
     <l n="151">The conscious priest , who was suborned before ,</l>
     <l n="152">Stood ready posted at the postern door ;</l>
     <l n="153">The maids in distant rooms were sent to rest ,</l>
     <l n="154">And nothing wanted but the invited guest .</l>
     <l n="155">He came , and , knocking thrice without delay ,</l>
     <l n="156">The longing lady heard , and turned the key ;</l>
     <l n="157">At once invaded him with all her charms ,</l>
     <l n="158">And the first step he made was in her arms :</l>
     <l n="159">The leathern outside , boisterous as it was ,</l>
     <l n="160">Gave way , and bent beneath her strict embrace :</l>
     <l n="161">On either side the kisses flew so thick ,</l>
     <l n="162">That neither he nor she had breath to speak .</l>
     <l n="163">The holy man , amazed at what he saw ,</l>
     <l n="164">Made haste to sanctify the bliss by law ;</l>
     <l n="165">And muttered fast the matrimony o'er ,</l>
     <l n="166">For fear committed sin should get before .</l>
     <l n="167">His work performed , he left the pair alone , }</l>
     <l n="168">Because he knew he could not go too soon ; }</l>
     <l n="169">His presence odious , when his task was done . }</l>
     <l n="170">What thoughts he had beseems not me to say ; }</l>
     <l n="171">Though some surmise he went to fast and pray , }</l>
     <l n="172">And needed both to drive the tempting thoughts away . }</l>
     <l n="173">The foe once gone , they took their full delight ;</l>
     <l n="174">‘ Twas restless rage , and tempest all the night ;</l>
     <l n="175">For greedy love each moment would employ ,</l>
     <l n="176">And grudged the shortest pauses of their joy .</l>
     <l n="177">Thus were their loves auspiciously begun ,</l>
     <l n="178">And thus with secret care were carried on .</l>
     <l n="179">The stealth itself did appetite restore ,</l>
     <l n="180">And looked so like a sin , it pleased the more .</l>
     <l n="181">The cave was now become a common way ,</l>
     <l n="182">The wicket , often opened , knew the key :</l>
     <l n="183">Love rioted secure , and , long enjoyed ,</l>
     <l n="184">Was ever eager , and was never cloyed .</l>
     <l n="185">But as extremes are short , of ill and good ,</l>
     <l n="186">And tides at highest mark regorge the flood ;</l>
     <l n="187">So fate , that could no more improve their joy ,</l>
     <l n="188">Took a malicious pleasure to destroy .</l>
     <l n="189">Tancred , who fondly loved , and whose delight</l>
     <l n="190">Was placed in his fair daughter 's daily sight ,</l>
     <l n="191">Of custom , when his state affairs were done ,</l>
     <l n="192">Would pass his pleasing hours with her alone ;</l>
     <l n="193">And , as a father 's privilege allowed ,</l>
     <l n="194">Without attendance of the officious crowd .</l>
     <l n="195">It happened once , that when in heat of day</l>
     <l n="196">He tried to sleep , as was his usual way ,</l>
     <l n="197">The balmy slumber fled his wakeful eyes ,</l>
     <l n="198">And forced him , in his own despite , to rise :</l>
     <l n="199">Of sleep forsaken , to relieve his care ,</l>
     <l n="200">He sought the conversation of the fair ;</l>
     <l n="201">But with her train of damsels she was gone ,</l>
     <l n="202">In shady walks the scorching heat to shun :</l>
     <l n="203">He would not violate that sweet recess ,</l>
     <l n="204">And found besides a welcome heaviness ,</l>
     <l n="205">That seized his eyes ; and slumber , which forgot</l>
     <l n="206">When called before to come , now came unsought .</l>
     <l n="207">From light retired , behind his daughter 's bed ,</l>
     <l n="208">He for approaching sleep composed his head ;</l>
     <l n="209">A chair was ready , for that use designed ,</l>
     <l n="210">So quilted , that he lay at ease reclined ;</l>
     <l n="211">The curtains closely drawn , the light to skreen ,</l>
     <l n="212">As if he had contrived to lie unseen :</l>
     <l n="213">Thus covered with an artificial night ,</l>
     <l n="214">Sleep did his office soon , and sealed his sight .</l>
     <l n="215">With heaven averse in this ill-omened hour ,</l>
     <l n="216">Was Guiscard summoned to the secret bower ,</l>
     <l n="217">And the fair nymph , with expectation fired ,</l>
     <l n="218">From her attending damsels was retired :</l>
     <l n="219">For , true to love , she measured time so right ,</l>
     <l n="220">As not to miss one moment of delight .</l>
     <l n="221">The garden , seated on the level floor ,</l>
     <l n="222">She left behind , and locking every door ,</l>
     <l n="223">Thought all secure ; but little did she know ,</l>
     <l n="224">Blind to her fate , she had inclosed her foe .</l>
     <l n="225">Attending Guiscard , in his leathern frock ,</l>
     <l n="226">Stood ready , with his thrice-repeated knock :</l>
     <l n="227">Thrice with a doleful sound the jarring grate</l>
     <l n="228">Rung deaf and hollow , and presaged their fate .</l>
     <l n="229">The door unlocked , to known delight they haste ,</l>
     <l n="230">And , panting in each other 's arms , embraced ;</l>
     <l n="231">Rush to the conscious bed , a mutual freight ,</l>
     <l n="232">And heedless press it with their wonted weight .</l>
     <l n="233">The sudden bound awaked the sleeping sire ,</l>
     <l n="234">And shewed a sight no parent can desire ;</l>
     <l n="235">His opening eyes at once with odious view</l>
     <l n="236">The love discovered , and the lover knew :</l>
     <l n="237">He would have cried ; but hoping that he dreamt ,</l>
     <l n="238">Amazement tied his tongue , and stopped the attempt .</l>
     <l n="239">The ensuing moment all the truth declared , }</l>
     <l n="240">But now he stood collected , and prepared ; }</l>
     <l n="241">For malice and revenge had put him on his guard . }</l>
     <l n="242">So like a lion that unheeded lay , }</l>
     <l n="243">Dissembling sleep , and watchful to betray , }</l>
     <l n="244">With inward rage he meditates his prey . }</l>
     <l n="245">The thoughtless pair , indulging their desires ,</l>
     <l n="246">Alternate kindled , and then quenched their fires ;</l>
     <l n="247">Nor thinking in the shades of death they played , }</l>
     <l n="248">Full of themselves , themselves alone surveyed , }</l>
     <l n="249">And , too secure , were by themselves betrayed . }</l>
     <l n="250">Long time dissolved in pleasure thus they lay ,</l>
     <l n="251">Till nature could no more suffice their play ;</l>
     <l n="252">Then rose the youth , and , through the cave again</l>
     <l n="253">Returned , the princess mingled with her train .</l>
     <l n="254">Resolved his unripe vengeance to defer ,</l>
     <l n="255">The royal spy , when now the coast was clear ,</l>
     <l n="256">Sought not the garden , but retired unseen ,</l>
     <l n="257">To brood in secret on his gathered spleen ,</l>
     <l n="258">And methodize revenge : to death he grieved ;</l>
     <l n="259">And , but he saw the crime , had scarce believed .</l>
     <l n="260">The appointment for the ensuing night he heard , }</l>
     <l n="261">And therefore in the cavern had prepared }</l>
     <l n="262">Two brawny yeomen of his trusty guard . }</l>
     <l n="263">Scarce had unwary Guiscard set his foot</l>
     <l n="264">Within the foremost entrance of the grot ,</l>
     <l n="265">When these in secret ambush ready lay ,</l>
     <l n="266">And rushing on the sudden seized the prey :</l>
     <l n="267">Encumbered with his frock , without defence , }</l>
     <l n="268">An easy prize , they led the prisoner thence , }</l>
     <l n="269">And , as commanded , brought before the prince . }</l>
     <l n="270">The gloomy sire , too sensible of wrong ,</l>
     <l n="271">To vent his rage in words , restrained his tongue ,</l>
     <l n="272">And only said ,— Thus servants are preferred ,</l>
     <l n="273">And , trusted , thus their sovereigns they reward .</l>
     <l n="274">Had I not seen , had not these eyes received</l>
     <l n="275">Too clear a proof , I could not have believed .—</l>
     <l n="276">He paused , and choked the rest . The youth , who saw</l>
     <l n="277">His forfeit life abandoned to the law ,</l>
     <l n="278">The judge the accuser , and the offence to him</l>
     <l n="279">Who had both power and will to avenge the crime .</l>
     <l n="280">No vain defence prepared ; but thus replied :—</l>
     <l n="281">The faults of love by love are justified :</l>
     <l n="282">With unresisted might the monarch reigns ,</l>
     <l n="283">He levels mountains , and he raises plains ;</l>
     <l n="284">And not regarding difference of degree ,</l>
     <l n="285">Abased your daughter , and exalted me .—</l>
     <l n="286">This bold return with seeming patience heard ,</l>
     <l n="287">The prisoner was remitted to the guard .</l>
     <l n="288">The sullen tyrant slept not all the night ,</l>
     <l n="289">But lonely walking by a winking light ,</l>
     <l n="290">Sobbed , wept , and groaned , and beat his withered breast ,</l>
     <l n="291">But would not violate his daughter 's rest ;</l>
     <l n="292">Who long expecting lay , for bliss prepared ,</l>
     <l n="293">Listning for noise , and grieved that none she heard ;</l>
     <l n="294">Oft rose , and oft in vain employed the key , }</l>
     <l n="295">And oft accused her lover of delay , }</l>
     <l n="296">And passed the tedious hours in anxious thoughts away . }</l>
     <l n="297">The morrow came ; and at his usual hour</l>
     <l n="298">Old Tancred visited his daughter 's bower ;</l>
     <l n="299">Her cheek ( for such his custom was ) he kissed ,</l>
     <l n="300">Then blessed her kneeling , and her maids dismissed .</l>
     <l n="301">The royal dignity thus far maintained ,</l>
     <l n="302">Now left in private , he no longer feigned ;</l>
     <l n="303">But all at once his grief and rage appeared ,</l>
     <l n="304">And floods of tears ran trickling down his beard .</l>
     <l n="305">O Sigismonda ,— he began to say : }</l>
     <l n="306">Thrice he began , and thrice was forced to stay , }</l>
     <l n="307">Till words with often trying found their way :— }</l>
     <l n="308">I thought , O Sigismonda , ( but how blind</l>
     <l n="309">Are parents ’ eyes , their children 's faults to find ! )</l>
     <l n="310">Thy virtue , birth , and breeding , were above</l>
     <l n="311">A mean desire , and vulgar sense of love ;</l>
     <l n="312">Nor less than sight and hearing could convince }</l>
     <l n="313">So fond a father , and so just a prince , }</l>
     <l n="314">Of such an unforeseen and unbelieved offence . }</l>
     <l n="315">Then what indignant sorrow must I have ,</l>
     <l n="316">To see thee lie subjected to my slave !</l>
     <l n="317">A man so smelling of the people 's lee ,</l>
     <l n="318">The court received him first for charity ;</l>
     <l n="319">And since with no degree of honour graced ,</l>
     <l n="320">But only suffered , where he first was placed .</l>
     <l n="321">A grovelling insect still ; and so designed</l>
     <l n="322">By nature 's hand , nor born of noble kind :</l>
     <l n="323">A thing , by neither man nor woman prized ,</l>
     <l n="324">And scarcely known enough to be despised .</l>
     <l n="325">To what has heaven reserved my age ? Ah ! why</l>
     <l n="326">Should man , when nature calls , not chuse to die ,</l>
     <l n="327">Rather than stretch the span of life , to find</l>
     <l n="328">Such ills as fate has wisely cast behind ,</l>
     <l n="329">For those to feel , whom fond desire to live</l>
     <l n="330">Makes covetous of more than life can give !</l>
     <l n="331">Each has his share of good ; and when ‘ tis gone ,</l>
     <l n="332">The guest , though hungry , cannot rise too soon .</l>
     <l n="333">But I , expecting more , in my own wrong</l>
     <l n="334">Protracting life , have lived a day too long .</l>
     <l n="335">If yesterday could be recalled again ,</l>
     <l n="336">Even now would I conclude my happy reign ;</l>
     <l n="337">But ‘ tis too late , my glorious race is run ,</l>
     <l n="338">And a dark cloud o'ertakes my setting sun .</l>
     <l n="339">Had'st thou not loved , or , loving , saved the shame ,</l>
     <l n="340">If not the sin , by some illustrious name ,</l>
     <l n="341">This little comfort had relieved my mind ,</l>
     <l n="342">‘ Twas frailty , not unusual to thy kind :</l>
     <l n="343">But thy low fall beneath thy royal blood ,</l>
     <l n="344">Shews downward appetite to mix with mud .</l>
     <l n="345">Thus not the least excuse is left for thee ,</l>
     <l n="346">Nor the least refuge for unhappy me .</l>
     <l n="347">For him I have resolved ; whom by surprise</l>
     <l n="348">I took , and scarce can tell it , in disguise ;</l>
     <l n="349">For such was his attire , as , with intent</l>
     <l n="350">Of nature , suited to his mean descent :</l>
     <l n="351">The harder question yet remains behind , }</l>
     <l n="352">What pains a parent and a prince can find }</l>
     <l n="353">To punish an offence of this degenerate kind . }</l>
     <l n="354">As I have loved , and yet I love thee more</l>
     <l n="355">Than ever father loved a child before ,</l>
     <l n="356">So that indulgence draws me to forgive :</l>
     <l n="357">Nature , that gave thee life , would have thee live .</l>
     <l n="358">But , as a public parent of the state ,</l>
     <l n="359">My justice , and thy crime , requires thy fate .</l>
     <l n="360">Fain would I choose a middle course to steer ;</l>
     <l n="361">Nature 's too kind , and justice too severe :</l>
     <l n="362">Speak for us both , and to the balance bring</l>
     <l n="363">On either side the father and the king .</l>
     <l n="364">Heaven knows , my heart is bent to favour thee ;</l>
     <l n="365">Make it but scanty weight , and leave the rest to me .—</l>
     <l n="366">Here stopping with a sigh , he poured a flood</l>
     <l n="367">Of tears , to make his last expression good .</l>
     <l n="368">She , who had heard him speak , nor saw alone</l>
     <l n="369">The secret conduct of her love was known ,</l>
     <l n="370">But he was taken who her soul possessed ,</l>
     <l n="371">Felt all the pangs of sorrow in her breast :</l>
     <l n="372">And little wanted , but a woman 's heart ,</l>
     <l n="373">With cries and tears , had testified her smart :</l>
     <l n="374">But inborn worth , that fortune can controul ,</l>
     <l n="375">New-strung , and stiffer bent her softer soul ;</l>
     <l n="376">The heroine assumed the woman 's place ,</l>
     <l n="377">Confirmed her mind , and fortified her face :</l>
     <l n="378">Why should she beg , or what could she pretend ,</l>
     <l n="379">When her stern father had condemned her friend !</l>
     <l n="380">Her life she might have had ; but her despair</l>
     <l n="381">Of saving his , had put it past her care :</l>
     <l n="382">Resolved on fate , she would not lose her breath ,</l>
     <l n="383">But , rather than not die , solicit death .</l>
     <l n="384">Fixed on this thought , she , not as women use ,</l>
     <l n="385">Her fault by common frailty would excuse ;</l>
     <l n="386">But boldly justified her innocence ,</l>
     <l n="387">And while the fact was owned , denied the offence :</l>
     <l n="388">Then with dry eyes , and with an open look ,</l>
     <l n="389">She met his glance mid-way , and thus undaunted spoke :—</l>
     <l n="390">Tancred , I neither am disposed to make</l>
     <l n="391">Request for life , nor offered life to take ;</l>
     <l n="392">Much less deny the deed ; but least of all</l>
     <l n="393">Beneath pretended justice weakly fall .</l>
     <l n="394">My words to sacred truth shall be confined ,</l>
     <l n="395">My deeds shall shew the greatness of my mind .</l>
     <l n="396">That I have loved , I own ; that still I love ,</l>
     <l n="397">I call to witness all the powers above :</l>
     <l n="398">Yet more I own ; to Guiscard 's love I give</l>
     <l n="399">The small remaining time I have to live ;</l>
     <l n="400">And if beyond this life desire can be ,</l>
     <l n="401">Not fate itself shall set my passion free .</l>
     <l n="402">This first avowed ; nor folly warped my mind ,</l>
     <l n="403">Nor the frail texture of the female kind</l>
     <l n="404">Betrayed my virtue ; for , too well I knew</l>
     <l n="405">What honour was , and honour had his due :</l>
     <l n="406">Before the holy priest my vows were tied ,</l>
     <l n="407">So came I not a strumpet , but a bride .</l>
     <l n="408">This for my fame , and for the public voice ;</l>
     <l n="409">Yet more , his merits justified my choice :</l>
     <l n="410">Which had they not , the first election thine ,</l>
     <l n="411">That bond dissolved , the next is freely mine :</l>
     <l n="412">Or grant I erred , ( which yet I must deny )</l>
     <l n="413">Had parents power even second vows to tie ,</l>
     <l n="414">Thy little care to mend my widowed nights , }</l>
     <l n="415">Has forced me to recourse of marriage-rites , }</l>
     <l n="416">To fill an empty side , and follow known delights . }</l>
     <l n="417">What have I done in this , deserving blame ?</l>
     <l n="418">State-laws may alter ; nature 's are the same ;</l>
     <l n="419">Those are usurped on helpless womankind ,</l>
     <l n="420">Made without our consent , and wanting power to bind .</l>
     <l n="421">Thou , Tancred , better shouldst have understood ,</l>
     <l n="422">That , as thy father gave thee flesh and blood ,</l>
     <l n="423">So gavest thou me : not from the quarry hewed ,</l>
     <l n="424">But of a softer mould , with sense endued ;</l>
     <l n="425">Even softer than thy own , of suppler kind ,</l>
     <l n="426">More exquisite of taste , and more than man refined .</l>
     <l n="427">Nor need'st thou by thy daughter to be told ,</l>
     <l n="428">Though now thy spritely blood with age be cold ,</l>
     <l n="429">Thou hast been young ; and canst remember still ,</l>
     <l n="430">That when thou hadst the power , thou hadst the will ;</l>
     <l n="431">And from the past experience of thy fires , }</l>
     <l n="432">Canst tell with what a tide our strong desires }</l>
     <l n="433">Come rushing on in youth , and what their rage requires . }</l>
     <l n="434">And grant thy youth was exercised in arms ,</l>
     <l n="435">When love no leisure found for softer charms ,</l>
     <l n="436">My tender age in luxury was trained , }</l>
     <l n="437">With idle ease and pageants entertained ; }</l>
     <l n="438">My hours my own , my pleasures unrestrained . }</l>
     <l n="439">So bred , no wonder if I took the bent</l>
     <l n="440">That seemed even warranted by thy consent ;</l>
     <l n="441">For when the father is too fondly kind ,</l>
     <l n="442">Such seed he sows , such harvest shall he find .</l>
     <l n="443">Blame then thyself , as reason 's law requires ,</l>
     <l n="444">( Since nature gave , and thou foment'st my fires ;)</l>
     <l n="445">If still those appetites continue strong ,</l>
     <l n="446">Thou may'st consider I am yet but young .</l>
     <l n="447">Consider too , that , having been a wife ,</l>
     <l n="448">I must have tasted of a better life ;</l>
     <l n="449">And am not to be blamed , if I renew ,</l>
     <l n="450">By lawful means , the joys which then I knew .</l>
     <l n="451">Where was the crime , if pleasure I procured ;</l>
     <l n="452">Young , and a woman , and to bliss inured ?</l>
     <l n="453">That was my case , and this is my defence :— }</l>
     <l n="454">I pleased myself , I shunned incontinence , }</l>
     <l n="455">And , urged by strong desires , indulged my sense . }</l>
     <l n="456">Left to myself , I must avow , I strove</l>
     <l n="457">From public shame to screen my secret love ,</l>
     <l n="458">And , well acquainted with thy native pride , }</l>
     <l n="459">Endeavoured what I could not help , to hide ; }</l>
     <l n="460">For which a woman 's wit an easy way supplied . }</l>
     <l n="461">How this , so well contrived , so closely laid ,</l>
     <l n="462">Was known to thee , or by what chance betrayed ,</l>
     <l n="463">Is not my care ; to please thy pride alone ,</l>
     <l n="464">I could have wished it had been still unknown .</l>
     <l n="465">Nor took I Guiscard by blind fancy led ,</l>
     <l n="466">Or hasty choice , as many women wed ;</l>
     <l n="467">But with deliberate care , and ripened thought ,</l>
     <l n="468">At leisure first designed , before I wrought .</l>
     <l n="469">On him I rested , after long debate ,</l>
     <l n="470">And , not without considering , fixed my fate .</l>
     <l n="471">His flame was equal , though by mine inspired ;</l>
     <l n="472">( For so the difference of our birth required :)</l>
     <l n="473">Had he been born like me , like me his love</l>
     <l n="474">Had first begun , what mine was forced to move :</l>
     <l n="475">But thus beginning , thus we persevere ; }</l>
     <l n="476">Our passions yet continue what they were , }</l>
     <l n="477">Nor length of trial makes our joys the less sincere . }</l>
     <l n="478">At this my choice , though not by thine allowed ,</l>
     <l n="479">( Thy judgment herding with the common crowd ,)</l>
     <l n="480">Thou tak'st unjust offence ; and , led by them ,</l>
     <l n="481">Dost less the merit than the man esteem .</l>
     <l n="482">Too sharply , Tancred , by thy pride betrayed ,</l>
     <l n="483">Hast thou against the laws of kind inveighed ;</l>
     <l n="484">For all the offence is in opinion placed ,</l>
     <l n="485">Which deems high birth by lowly choice debased .</l>
     <l n="486">This thought alone with fury fires thy breast ,</l>
     <l n="487">( For holy marriage justifies the rest ,)</l>
     <l n="488">That I have sunk the glories of the state ,</l>
     <l n="489">And mixed my blood with a plebeian mate :</l>
     <l n="490">In which I wonder thou shouldst oversee }</l>
     <l n="491">Superior causes , or impute to me }</l>
     <l n="492">The fault of fortune , or the Fates ’ decree . }</l>
     <l n="493">Or call it heaven 's imperial power alone ,</l>
     <l n="494">Which moves on springs of justice , though unknown ;</l>
     <l n="495">Yet this we see , though ordered for the best ,</l>
     <l n="496">The bad exalted , and the good oppressed ;</l>
     <l n="497">Permitted laurels grace the lawless brow ;</l>
     <l n="498">The unworthy raised , the worthy cast below .</l>
     <l n="499">But leaving that : search we the secret springs ,</l>
     <l n="500">And backward trace the principles of things ;</l>
     <l n="501">There shall we find , that , when the world began ,</l>
     <l n="502">One common mass composed the mould of man ;</l>
     <l n="503">One paste of flesh on all degrees bestowed ,</l>
     <l n="504">And kneaded up alike with moistening blood .</l>
     <l n="505">The same Almighty Power inspired the frame</l>
     <l n="506">With kindled life , and formed the souls the same :</l>
     <l n="507">The faculties of intellect and will }</l>
     <l n="508">Dispensed with equal hand , disposed with equal skill , }</l>
     <l n="509">Like liberty indulged , with choice of good or ill. }</l>
     <l n="510">Thus born alike , from virtue first began</l>
     <l n="511">The difference that distinguished man from man :</l>
     <l n="512">He claimed no title from descent of blood ,</l>
     <l n="513">But that which made him noble made him good .</l>
     <l n="514">Warmed with more particles of heavenly flame , }</l>
     <l n="515">He winged his upward flight , and soared to fame ; }</l>
     <l n="516">The rest remained below , a tribe without a name . }</l>
     <l n="517">This law , though custom now diverts the course ,</l>
     <l n="518">As nature 's institute , is yet in force ;</l>
     <l n="519">Uncancelled , though disused : and he , whose mind</l>
     <l n="520">Is virtuous , is alone of noble kind ;</l>
     <l n="521">Though poor in fortune , of celestial race ;</l>
     <l n="522">And he commits the crime , who calls him base .</l>
     <l n="523">Now lay the line , and measure all thy court</l>
     <l n="524">By inward virtue , not external port ,</l>
     <l n="525">And find whom justly to prefer above</l>
     <l n="526">The man on whom my judgment placed my love ;</l>
     <l n="527">So shalt thou see his parts and person shine ,</l>
     <l n="528">And , thus compared , the rest a base degenerate line .</l>
     <l n="529">Nor took I , when I first surveyed thy court ,</l>
     <l n="530">His valour or his virtues on report ;</l>
     <l n="531">But trusted what I ought to trust alone ,</l>
     <l n="532">Relying on thy eyes , and not my own ;</l>
     <l n="533">Thy praise ( and thine was then the public voice )</l>
     <l n="534">First recommended Guiscard to my choice :</l>
     <l n="535">Directed thus by thee , I looked , and found</l>
     <l n="536">A man I thought deserving to be crowned ;</l>
     <l n="537">First by my father pointed to my sight ,</l>
     <l n="538">Nor less conspicuous by his native light ;</l>
     <l n="539">His mind , his mien , the features of his face ,</l>
     <l n="540">Excelling all the rest of human race :</l>
     <l n="541">These were thy thoughts , and thou couldst judge aright ,</l>
     <l n="542">Till interest made a jaundice in thy sight .</l>
     <l n="543">Or should I grant thou didst not rightly see ,</l>
     <l n="544">Then thou wert first deceived , and I deceived by thee .</l>
     <l n="545">But if thou shalt allege , through pride of mind ,</l>
     <l n="546">Thy blood with one of base condition joined ,</l>
     <l n="547">‘ Tis false ; for ‘ tis not baseness to be poor :</l>
     <l n="548">His poverty augments thy crime the more ;</l>
     <l n="549">Upbraids thy justice with the scant regard</l>
     <l n="550">Of worth ; whom princes praise , they should reward .</l>
     <l n="551">Are these the kings entrusted by the crowd</l>
     <l n="552">With wealth , to be dispensed for common good ?</l>
     <l n="553">The people sweat not for their king 's delight ,</l>
     <l n="554">To enrich a pimp , or raise a parasite ;</l>
     <l n="555">Theirs is the toil ; and he , who well has served</l>
     <l n="556">His country , has his country 's wealth deserved .</l>
     <l n="557">Even mighty monarchs oft are meanly born ,</l>
     <l n="558">And kings by birth to lowest rank return ;</l>
     <l n="559">All subject to the power of giddy chance ,</l>
     <l n="560">For fortune can depress , or can advance :</l>
     <l n="561">But true nobility is of the mind ,</l>
     <l n="562">Not given by chance , and not to chance resigned .</l>
     <l n="563">For the remaining doubt of thy decree ,</l>
     <l n="564">What to resolve , and how dispose of me ;</l>
     <l n="565">Be warned to cast that useless care aside ,</l>
     <l n="566">Myself alone will for myself provide .</l>
     <l n="567">If in thy doating and decrepit age ,</l>
     <l n="568">Thy soul , a stranger in thy youth to rage ,</l>
     <l n="569">Begins in cruel deeds to take delight ,</l>
     <l n="570">Gorge with my blood thy barbarous appetite ;</l>
     <l n="571">For I so little am disposed to pray</l>
     <l n="572">For life , I would not cast a wish away .</l>
     <l n="573">Such as it is , the offence is all my own ;</l>
     <l n="574">And what to Guiscard is already done ,</l>
     <l n="575">Or to be done is doomed by thy decree , }</l>
     <l n="576">That , if not executed first by thee , }</l>
     <l n="577">Shall on my person be performed by me . }</l>
     <l n="578">Away ! with women weep , and leave me here ,</l>
     <l n="579">Fixed , like a man , to die without a tear ;</l>
     <l n="580">Or save , or slay us both this present hour ,</l>
     <l n="581">‘ Tis all that fate has left within thy power .—</l>
     <l n="582">She said ; nor did her father fail to find ,</l>
     <l n="583">In all she spoke , the greatness of her mind ;</l>
     <l n="584">Yet thought she was not obstinate to die ,</l>
     <l n="585">Nor deemed the death she promised was so nigh .</l>
     <l n="586">Secure in this belief , he left the dame ,</l>
     <l n="587">Resolved to spare her life , and save her shame ;</l>
     <l n="588">But that detested object to remove ,</l>
     <l n="589">To wreck his vengeance , and to cure her love .</l>
     <l n="590">Intent on this , a secret order signed</l>
     <l n="591">The death of Guiscard to his guards enjoined ;</l>
     <l n="592">Strangling was chosen , and the night the time ;</l>
     <l n="593">A mute revenge , and blind as was the crime .</l>
     <l n="594">His faithful heart , a bloody sacrifice ,</l>
     <l n="595">Torn from his breast , to glut the tyrant 's eyes ,</l>
     <l n="596">Closed the severe command ; for ( slaves to pay )</l>
     <l n="597">What kings decree , the soldier must obey :</l>
     <l n="598">Waged against foes ; and when the wars are o'er ,</l>
     <l n="599">Fit only to maintain despotic power ;</l>
     <l n="600">Dangerous to freedom , and desired alone</l>
     <l n="601">By kings , who seek an arbitrary throne .<span corresp="#note215" type="note_anchor">[ 215 ]</span></l>
     <l n="602">Such were these guards ; as ready to have slain</l>
     <l n="603">The prince himself , allured with greater gain :</l>
     <l n="604">So was the charge performed with better will ,</l>
     <l n="605">By men inured to blood , and exercised in ill .</l>
     <l n="606">Now , though the sullen sire had eased his mind , }</l>
     <l n="607">The pomp of his revenge was yet behind , }</l>
     <l n="608">A pomp prepared to grace the present he designed . }</l>
     <l n="609">A goblet rich with gems , and rough with gold ,</l>
     <l n="610">Of depth and breadth the precious pledge to hold ,</l>
     <l n="611">With cruel care he chose ; the hollow part</l>
     <l n="612">Inclosed , the lid concealed the lover 's heart .</l>
     <l n="613">Then of his trusted mischiefs one he sent ,</l>
     <l n="614">And bade him , with these words , the gift present :—</l>
     <l n="615">“ Thy father sends thee this to cheer thy breast ,</l>
     <l n="616">And glad thy sight with what thou lov'st the best ;</l>
     <l n="617">As thou hast pleased his eyes , and joyed his mind ,</l>
     <l n="618">With what he loved the most of human kind . ” —</l>
     <l n="619">Ere this , the royal dame , who well had weighed</l>
     <l n="620">The consequence of what her sire had said ,</l>
     <l n="621">Fixed on her fate , against the expected hour ,</l>
     <l n="622">procured the means to have it in her power ;</l>
     <l n="623">For this , she had distilled , with early care ,</l>
     <l n="624">The juice of simples , friendly to despair ,</l>
     <l n="625">A magazine of death ; and thus prepared ,</l>
     <l n="626">Secure to die , the fatal message heard :</l>
     <l n="627">Then smiled severe ; nor with a troubled look ,</l>
     <l n="628">Or trembling hand , the funeral present took ;</l>
     <l n="629">Even kept her countenance , when the lid removed</l>
     <l n="630">Disclosed the heart , unfortunately loved .</l>
     <l n="631">She needed not be told , within whose breast</l>
     <l n="632">It lodged ; the message had explained the rest .</l>
     <l n="633">Or not amazed , or hiding her surprise ,</l>
     <l n="634">She sternly on the bearer fixed her eyes ;</l>
     <l n="635">Then thus :— Tell Tancred , on his daughter 's part ,</l>
     <l n="636">The gold , though precious , equals not the heart :</l>
     <l n="637">But he did well to give his best ; and I ,</l>
     <l n="638">Who wished a worthier urn , forgive his poverty .—</l>
     <l n="639">At this she curbed a groan , that else had come ,</l>
     <l n="640">And , pausing , viewed the present in the tomb ;</l>
     <l n="641">Then to the heart , adored devoutly , glued</l>
     <l n="642">Her lips , and , raising it , her speech renewed :—</l>
     <l n="643">Even from my day of birth to this , the bound</l>
     <l n="644">Of my unhappy being , I have found</l>
     <l n="645">My father 's care and tenderness expressed ;</l>
     <l n="646">But this last act of love excels the rest :</l>
     <l n="647">For this so dear a present , bear him back</l>
     <l n="648">The best return that I can live to make .—</l>
     <l n="649">The messenger dispatched , again she viewed</l>
     <l n="650">The loved remains , and , sighing , thus pursued :—</l>
     <l n="651">Source of my life , and lord of my desires ,</l>
     <l n="652">In whom I lived , with whom my soul expires !</l>
     <l n="653">Poor heart ! no more the spring of vital heat ;</l>
     <l n="654">Cursed be the hands that tore thee from thy seat !</l>
     <l n="655">The course is finished which thy fates decreed ,</l>
     <l n="656">And thou from thy corporeal prison freed :</l>
     <l n="657">Soon hast thou reached the goal with mended pace ;</l>
     <l n="658">A world of woes dispatched in little space .</l>
     <l n="659">Forced by thy worth , thy foe , in death become</l>
     <l n="660">Thy friend , has lodged thee in a costly tomb .</l>
     <l n="661">There yet remained thy funeral exequies ,</l>
     <l n="662">The weeping tribute of thy widow 's eyes ;</l>
     <l n="663">And those indulgent heaven has found the way ,</l>
     <l n="664">That I , before my death , have leave to pay .</l>
     <l n="665">My father even in cruelty is kind , }</l>
     <l n="666">Or heaven has turned the malice of his mind }</l>
     <l n="667">To better uses than his hate designed ; }</l>
     <l n="668">And made the insult , which in his gift appears ,</l>
     <l n="669">The means to mourn thee with my pious tears ;</l>
     <l n="670">Which I will pay thee down before I go ,</l>
     <l n="671">And save myself the pains to weep below ,</l>
     <l n="672">If souls can weep . Though once I meant to meet</l>
     <l n="673">My fate with face unmoved , and eyes unwet ,</l>
     <l n="674">Yet , since I have thee here in narrow room ,</l>
     <l n="675">My tears shall set thee first afloat within thy tomb .</l>
     <l n="676">Then ( as I know thy spirit hovers nigh )</l>
     <l n="677">Under thy friendly conduct will I fly</l>
     <l n="678">To regions unexplored , secure to share }</l>
     <l n="679">Thy state ; nor hell shall punishment appear ; }</l>
     <l n="680">And heaven is double heaven , if thou art there .— }</l>
     <l n="681">She said : Her brimful eyes , that ready stood ,</l>
     <l n="682">And only wanted will to weep a flood ,</l>
     <l n="683">Released their watery store , and poured amain ,</l>
     <l n="684">Like clouds low-hung , a sober shower of rain ;</l>
     <l n="685">Mute solemn sorrow , free from female noise ,</l>
     <l n="686">Such as the majesty of grief destroys ;</l>
     <l n="687">For , bending o'er the cup , the tears she shed ,</l>
     <l n="688">Seemed by the posture to discharge her head ,</l>
     <l n="689">O'erhYpppHeNfilled before ; and ( oft her mouth applied</l>
     <l n="690">To the cold heart ) she kissed at once , and cried .</l>
     <l n="691">Her maids , who stood amazed , nor knew the cause</l>
     <l n="692">Of her complaining , nor whose heart it was ,</l>
     <l n="693">Yet all due measures of her mourning kept ,</l>
     <l n="694">Did office at the dirge , and by infection wept ,</l>
     <l n="695">And oft enquired the occasion of her grief ,</l>
     <l n="696">( Unanswered but by sighs ) and offered vain relief .</l>
     <l n="697">At length , her stock of tears already shed ,</l>
     <l n="698">She wiped her eyes , she raised her drooping head ,</l>
     <l n="699">And thus pursued :— O ever faithful heart ,</l>
     <l n="700">I have performed the ceremonial part ,</l>
     <l n="701">The decencies of grief ; it rests behind ,</l>
     <l n="702">That , as our bodies were , our souls be joined ;</l>
     <l n="703">To thy whate'er abode my shade convey ,</l>
     <l n="704">And , as an elder ghost , direct the way !—</l>
     <l n="705">She said ; and bade the vial to be brought ,</l>
     <l n="706">Where she before had brewed the deadly draught ;</l>
     <l n="707">First pouring out the med'cinable bane ,</l>
     <l n="708">The heart , her tears had rinsed , she bathed again ;</l>
     <l n="709">Then down her throat the death securely throws ,</l>
     <l n="710">And quaffs a long oblivion of her woes .</l>
     <l n="711">This done , she mounts the genial bed , and there</l>
     <l n="712">( Her body first composed with honest care )</l>
     <l n="713">Attends the welcome rest ; her hands yet hold ,</l>
     <l n="714">Close to her heart , the monumental gold ;</l>
     <l n="715">Nor farther word she spoke , but closed her sight ,</l>
     <l n="716">And quiet sought the covert of the night .</l>
     <l n="717">The damsels , who the while in silence mourned ,</l>
     <l n="718">Not knowing , nor suspecting death suborned ,</l>
     <l n="719">Yet , as their duty was , to Tancred sent ,</l>
     <l n="720">Who , conscious of the occasion , feared the event .</l>
     <l n="721">Alarmed , and with presaging heart , he came ,</l>
     <l n="722">And drew the curtains , and exposed the dame</l>
     <l n="723">To loathsome light ; then , with a late relief ,</l>
     <l n="724">Made vain efforts to mitigate her grief .</l>
     <l n="725">She , what she could , excluding day , her eyes</l>
     <l n="726">Kept firmly sealed , and sternly thus replies :—</l>
     <l n="727">Tancred , restrain thy tears , unsought by me ,</l>
     <l n="728">And sorrow unavailing now to thee :</l>
     <l n="729">Did ever man before afflict his mind ,</l>
     <l n="730">To see the effect of what himself designed ?</l>
     <l n="731">Yet if thou hast remaining in thy heart</l>
     <l n="732">Some sense of love , some unextinguished part</l>
     <l n="733">Of former kindness , largely once professed , }</l>
     <l n="734">Let me by that adjure thy hardened breast , }</l>
     <l n="735">Not to deny thy daughter 's last request : }</l>
     <l n="736">The secret love which I so long enjoyed ,</l>
     <l n="737">And still concealed , to gratify thy pride ,</l>
     <l n="738">Thou hast disjoined ; but , with my dying breath ,</l>
     <l n="739">Seek not , I beg thee , to disjoin our death :</l>
     <l n="740">Where'er his corpse by thy command is laid ,</l>
     <l n="741">Thither let mine in public be conveyed ;</l>
     <l n="742">Exposed in open view , and side by side ,</l>
     <l n="743">Acknowledged as a bridegroom and a bride .—</l>
     <l n="744">The prince 's anguish hindered his reply ;</l>
     <l n="745">And she , who felt her fate approaching nigh ,</l>
     <l n="746">Seized the cold heart , and heaving to her breast ,—</l>
     <l n="747">Here , precious pledge , she said , securely rest .—</l>
     <l n="748">These accents were her last ; the creeping death</l>
     <l n="749">Benumbed her senses first , then stopped her breath .</l>
     <l n="750">Thus she for disobedience justly died ;</l>
     <l n="751">The sire was justly punished for his pride ;</l>
     <l n="752">The youth , least guilty , suffered for the offence ,</l>

   <p>ORIGINAL , FROM THE DECAMERON .</p>
   <p>THE FOURTH DAY .</p>
   <p>NOVEL I .</p>
   <p>Tancred , prince of Salerno , puts his daughter 's lover to death , and sends his heart to her in a golden cup ; she pours water upon it , which she had poisoned , and so dies .</p>
   <p>Our king has given us a most melancholy subject for this day 's discourse ; considering that , as we came hither to be merry , we must now recount other people 's misfortunes , which cannot be related without moving compassion , as well in those who tell , as in those who hear them . Perhaps it is designed as an allay to the mirth of the preceding days . But , whatever his reason may be for it , I have no business to make any alteration with regard to his pleasure . I shall , therefore , mention an unhappy story to you , worthy of your most tender compassion .</p>
   <p>Tancred , prince of Salerno , was a most humane and generous lord , had he not , in his old age , defiled his hands in a lover 's blood . He , through the whole course of his life , had one only daughter ; and happy had he been not to have possessed her . No child could be more dear to a parent than she was , which made him loth to part with her in marriage : at length , not till she was a little advanced in years , he married her to the duke of Capoa , when she was soon left a widow , and came home again to her father . She was a lady of great beauty and understanding , and continuing thus in the court of her father , who took no care to marry her again , and it seeming not so modest in her to ask it , she resolved at last to have a lover privately . Accordingly , she made choice of a person of low parentage , but noble qualities , whose name was Guiscard , with whom she became violently in love ; and by often seeing him , and evermore commending his manner and behaviour , he soon became sensible of it , and devoted himself entirely to the love of her . Affecting each other thus in secret , and she desiring nothing so much as to be with him , and not daring to trust any person with the affair , contrived a new stratagem in order to apprise him of the means . She wrote a letter , wherein she mentioned what she would have him do the next day for her ; this she put into a hollow cane , and giving it to him one day , she said , pleasantly , “ You may make a pair of bellows of this , for your servant to blow the fire with this evening . ” He received it , supposing , very justly , that it had some meaning , and , taking it home , found the letter ; which , when he had thoroughly considered , and knew what he had to do , he was the most overjoyed man that could be ; and he applied himself accordingly to answer her assignation , in the manner she had directed him . On one side of the palace , and under a mountain , was a grotto , which had been made time out of mind , and into which no light could come but through a little opening dug in the mountain , and which , as the grotto had been long in disuse , was now grown over with briers and thorns . Into this grotto was a passage , by a private stair-case , out of one of the rooms of the palace , which belonged to the lady 's apartment , and was secured by a very strong door . This passage was so far out of every one 's thoughts , having been disused for so long a time , that nobody remembered any thing about it ; but love , whose notice nothing can escape , brought it fresh into the mind of the enamoured lady ; who , to keep this thing entirely private , laboured some days before she could get the door open ; when having gone down into the cave , and observed the opening , and how high it might be from thence to the bottom , she acquainted him with the fact . Guiscard then provided a ladder of cords ; and casing himself well with leather , to be defended from the thorns , fixing one end of the ladder to the stump of a tree which was near , he slid down by the help of it to the bottom , where he stayed expecting the lady . The following day , therefore , having sent her maids out of the way , under pretence that she was going to lie down , and locking herself up alone in her chamber , she opened the door , and descended into the grotto , where they met to their mutual satisfaction . From thence she shewed him the way to her chamber , where they were together the greatest part of the day , and taking proper measures for the time to come , he went away through the cave , and she returned to her maids . The same he did the next night ; and he followed this course for a considerable time , when fortune , as if she envied them their happiness , thought fit to change their mirth into mourning . Tancred used sometimes to come into his daughter 's chamber , to pass a little time away with her ; and going thither one day after dinner , whilst the lady , whose name was Ghismond , was with her maids in the garden ; and being perceived by no one , nor yet willing to take her from her diversion , finding also the windows shut , and the curtains drawn to the feet of the bed , he threw himself down in a great chair , which stood in a corner of the room , leaning his head upon the bed , and drawing the curtain before him , as if he concealed himself on purpose , when he chanced to fall asleep . In the mean time , Ghismond having made an appointment with her lover , left the maids in the garden , and came into her chamber , which she secured , not thinking of any person being there , and went to meet Guiscard , who was in the cave waiting for her , and brought him into her chamber ; when her father awoke , and was a witness to all that passed between them . This was the utmost affliction to him , and he was about to cry out ; but , upon second thoughts , he resolved to keep it private , if possible , that he might be able to do more securely , and with less disgrace , what he had resolved upon . The lovers stayed together their usual time , without perceiving any thing of Tancred , who , after they were departed , got out of the window into the garden , old as he was , and went , without being seen by any one , very sorrowful to his chamber . The next night , according to his orders , Guiscard was seized by two men as he was coming out of the cave , and carried by them , in his leathern doublet , to Tancred , who , as soon as he saw him , said , with tears in his eyes : “ Guiscard , you have ill requited my kindness towards you , by this outrage and shame which you have brought upon me , and of which this very day I have been an eye-witness . ” When he made no other answer but this : “ Sir , love hath greater power than either you or I . ” Tancred then ordered a guard to be set over him . And the next day he went to his daughter 's apartment as usual , she knowing nothing of what had happened , and shutting the door , that they might be private together , he said to her , weeping , “ Daughter , I had such an opinion of your modesty and virtue , that I could never have believed , had I not seen it with my own eyes , that you would have violated either , even so much as in thought . My reflecting on this will make the small pittance of life that is left very grievous to me . As you were determined to act in that manner , would to heaven you had made choice of a person more suitable to your own quality ; but for this Guiscard , he is one of the very meanest persons about my court . This gives me such concern , that I scarcely know what to do . As for him , he was secured by my order last night , and his fate is determined . But , with regard to yourself , I am influenced by two different motives ; on one side , the tenderest regard that a father can have for a child ; and on the other , the justest vengeance for the great folly you have committed . One pleads strongly in your behalf ; and the other would excite me to do an act contrary to my nature . But before I come to a resolution , I would hear what you have to say for yourself . ” And when he said this , he hung down his head , and wept like a child . She hearing this from her father , and perceiving that their amour was not only discovered , but her lover in prison , was under the greatest concern imaginable , and was going to break out into loud and grievous lamentations , as is the way of women in distress ; but getting the better of this weakness , and putting on a settled countenance , as supposing Guiscard was dead , and being resolved firmly in her own mind not to outlive him , she spoke therefore with all the composure in the world to this purpose : “ Sir , to deny what I have done , or to entreat any favour of you , is no part of my design at present ; for as the one can avail me nothing , so I intend the other shall be of little service . I will take no advantage of your love and tenderness towards me ; but shall first , by an open confession , endeavour to vindicate myself , and then do what the greatness of my soul prompts me to . ‘ Tis most true that I have loved , and do still love , Guiscard ; and while I live , which will not be long , shall continue to love him : and if such a thing as love be after death , even that shall not dissolve it . To this I was induced by no frailty , so much as his superior virtue , and the little care you took to marry me again . I preferred him before all the world ; and as to the meanness of his station , to which you so much object , that is more the fault of fortune , who often raises the most unworthy to an high estate , neglecting those of greater merit . We are all formed of the same materials , and by the same hand . The first difference amongst mankind was made by virtue ; they who were virtuous were deemed noble , and the rest were all accounted otherwise . Though this law therefore may have been obscured by contrary custom , yet is it discarded neither by nature , nor good manners . If you then alone regard the worth and virtue of your courtiers , and consider that of Guiscard , you will find him the only noble person , and the others a set of poltroons . With regard to his worth and valour , I appeal to yourself . Who ever commended man more for every thing that was praise-worthy , than you have commended him ? and deservedly in my judgement ; but if I was deceived , it was by following your opinion . If you say then , that I have had an affair with a person base and ignoble , I deny it ; if with a poor one , it is to your shame , to let such merit go unrewarded . Now concerning your last doubt , namely , how you are to deal with me ; use your pleasure . If you are disposed to commit an act of cruelty , I shall say nothing to prevent such a resolution . But this I must apprise you of , that unless you do the same to me , which you either have done , or mean to do to Guiscard , my own hands shall do it for you . Reserve your tears then for women ; and if you mean to act with severity , cut us off both together , if it appears to you that we have deserved it . ” The prince knew full well the greatness of her soul ; but yet he could by no means persuade himself , that she would have resolution enough to do what her words seemed to threaten . Leaving her then , with a design of being favourable to her , and intending to wean her affection from her lover by taking him off , he gave orders to the two men , who guarded him , to strangle him privately in the night , and to take his heart out of his body , and bring it to him . Accordingly they executed his commands , and the next day he called for a golden cup , and putting the heart into it , he had it conveyed by a trusty servant to his daughter , with this message : “ Your father sends this present to comfort you , with what was most dear to you ; even as he was comforted by you , in what was most dear to him . ” She had departed from her father , not at all moved as to her resolution , and therefore had prepared the juices of some poisonous plants , which she had mixed with water to be at hand , if what she feared should come to pass . When the servant had delivered the present , and reported the message according to his order , she took the cup , without changing countenance , and seeing the heart therein , and knowing by the words that it must be Guiscard 's , she looked stedfastly at the servant , and said : “ My father has done very wisely ; such a heart as this requires no worse a sepulchre than that of gold . ” And upon this she lifted it to her mouth and kissed it , thus continuing ; “ All my life long , even to this last period of it , have I found my father 's love most abundant towards me ; but now more than ever : therefore return him , in my name , the last thanks that I shall ever be able to give him for such a present . ” Looking then towards the cup , which she held fast in her hand , she said : “ Alas ! the dearest end and centre of all my wishes ! Cursed be the cruelty of him , by whom these eyes now see you ; although my soul had long viewed and known you . You have finished your course ; such a one indeed as fortune has thought fit to allot you ; you are arrived at the goal to which we all tend ; you have left the miseries of this world far behind , and have obtained such a sepulchre from your very enemy , as your merit required . Nothing remained to make your obsequies complete , but the tears of her who was so dear to you whilst you were living ; and which , that you should not now want , heaven put it into the mind of my relentless father to send you to me . And you shall have them , though I had purposed to die unmoved , and without shedding a tear ; and when I have done , I will instantly join my soul to yours : for in what other company can I go better and safer to those unknown regions ? as I make no doubt your soul is hovering here , expecting mine . ” When she had done speaking , she shed a flood of tears , kissing the heart a thousand times ; whilst the damsels who were about her knew neither what heart it was , nor what those her words imported ; but being moved with pity , they joined with her , begging to know the cause of her grief , and endeavouring all they could to comfort her . After she had lamented as much as she thought proper , she raised up her head , and wiping her eyes , said , “ Thou heart , most dearly beloved ! all my duty is now performed towards thee ; nothing more remains , but for my soul to accompany thine . ” Upon this she bade them reach the vessel of water , which she had prepared the day before , and pouring it into the cup with the heart , which she had sufficiently washed with her tears , she drank it all off without the least dread or apprehension ; and then threw herself upon the bed with the cup in her hand , composing her body as decently as she could , and pressing her lover 's heart to her 's , she lay without uttering a word more , expecting death . The maids , when they saw this , though they knew not what it was she had drunk , sent to acquaint Tancred ; who fearing what had really happened , came into the room soon after she had laid herself down , and finding it was too late , began to lament most grievously . She then said to him , “ Sir , save those tears against worse fortune that may happen , for I want them not . Who but yourself would mourn for a thing of your own doing ? But if any part of that love now remains in you , which you once had for me , the last request I shall make is , that as you would not suffer us to be happy together whilst living , that our two bodies ( wherever you have disposed of his ) may be publicly interred together when dead . ” Extreme grief would suffer him to make no reply ; when , finding herself drawing near her end , she strained the heart strongly to her breast , saying , “ Receive us , heaven ; I die ! ” Then closing her eyes , all sense forsook her , and she departed this miserable life . Such an end had the amours of Guiscard and Ghismond , as you have now heard ; whilst the prince , repenting of his cruelty when it was too late , had them buried in one grave , in the most public manner , to the general grief of all the people of Salerno .</p>

    <head>THEODORE AND HONORIA .</head>
    <head>Boccacio , who , according to Benvenuto da Imola , was a curious investigator of all delectable histories , is said to have taken this goblin tale from the Chronicle of Helinandus , a French monk , who flourished in the reign of Philip Augustus ,<span corresp="#note216" type="note_anchor">[ 216 ]</span>and composed a history of the world from its creation , as was the fashion of monkish historians . The Florentine novelist , however , altered the place of action , and disguised the names of the persons , whom he calls Nastagio and Traversari , the designations of two noble families in Ravenna . So good a subject for a ballad did not escape our English makers , by one of whom the novel of Boccacio was turned into the ballad stanza<span corresp="#note217" type="note_anchor">[ 217 ]</span>. Dryden , however , converted that into a poem , which , in the hands of the old rhymer , was only a tale , and has given us a proof how exquisitely his powers were adapted for the management of the machinery , or supernatural agency of an epic poem , had his situation suffered him to undertake the task he so long meditated . Nothing can be more highly painted than the circumstances preliminary of the apparition ;— the deepening gloom , the falling wind , the commencement of an earthquake ; above all , the indescribable sensation of horror with which Theodore is affected , even ere he sees the actors in the supernatural tragedy . The appearance of the female , of the gaunt mastiffs by which she is pursued , and of the infernal huntsman , are all in the highest tone of poetry , and could only be imitated by the pencil of Salvator . There is also a masterly description of Theodore 's struggles between his native courage , prompted by chivalrous education , and that terror which the presence of supernatural beings imposes upon the living . It is by the account of the impression , which such a sight makes upon the supposed spectator , more even than by a laboured description of the vision itself , that the narrator of such a tale must hope to excite the sympathetic awe of his audience . Thus , in the vision so sublimely described in the book of Job , chap . iv . no external cause of terror is even sketched in outline , and our feelings of dread are only excited by the fear which came upon the spectator , and the trembling which made all his bones to shake . But the fable of Dryden combines a most impressive description of the vision , with a detailed account of its effect upon Theodore , and both united make the most admirable poem of the kind that ever was written . It is somewhat derogatory from the dignity of the apparition , that Theodore , having once witnessed its terrors , should coolly lay a scheme for converting them to his own advantage ; but this is an original fault in the story , for which Dryden is not answerable . The second apparition of the infernal hunter to the assembled guests , is as striking as the first ; a circumstance well worthy of notice , when we consider the difficulty and hazard of telling such a story twice . But in the second narration , the poet artfully hurries over the particulars of the lady 's punishment , which were formerly given in detail , and turns the reader 's attention upon the novel effect produced by it , upon the assembled guests , which is admirably described , as “ a mute scene of sorrow mixed with fear . ” The interrupted banquet , the appalled gallants , and the terrified women , grouped with the felon knight , his meagre mastiffs , and mangled victim , displays the hand of the master poet . The conclusion of the story is defective from the cause already hinted at . The machinery is too powerful for the effect produced by it ; a lady 's hard heart might have been melted without so terrible an example of the punishment of obduracy .</head>
     <l n="1">It is scarcely worth while to mention , that Dryden has changed the</l>
     <l n="2">Italian names into others better adapted to English heroic verse .</l>

    <p>THEODORE AND HONORIA .</p>
     <l n="1">Of all the cities in Romanian lands ,</l>
     <l n="2">The chief , and most renowned , Ravenna stands ;</l>
     <l n="3">Adorned in ancient times with arms and arts ,</l>

     <l n="6">With gifts of fortune and of nature blessed ,</l>
     <l n="7">The foremost place for wealth and honour held ,</l>
     <l n="8">And all in feats of chivalry excelled .</l>
     <l n="9">This noble youth to madness loved a dame ,</l>
     <l n="10">Of high degree , Honoria was her name ;</l>
     <l n="11">Fair as the fairest , but of haughty mind ,</l>
     <l n="12">And fiercer than became so soft a kind :</l>
     <l n="13">Proud of her birth , ( for equal she had none ;)</l>
     <l n="14">The rest she scorned , but hated him alone .</l>
     <l n="15">His gifts , his constant courtship , nothing gained ;</l>
     <l n="16">For she , the more he loved , the more disdained .</l>
     <l n="17">He lived with all the pomp he could devise , }</l>
     <l n="18">At tilts and tournaments obtained the prize , }</l>
     <l n="19">But found no favour in his lady 's eyes : }</l>
     <l n="20">Relentless as a rock , the lofty maid</l>
     <l n="21">Turned all to poison that he did or said :</l>
     <l n="22">Nor prayers , nor tears , nor offered vows , could move . }</l>
     <l n="23">The work went backward ; and the more he strove }</l>
     <l n="24">To advance his suit , the farther from her love . }</l>
     <l n="25">Wearied at length , and wanting remedy ,</l>
     <l n="26">He doubted oft , and oft resolved to die .</l>
     <l n="27">But pride stood ready to prevent the blow ,</l>
     <l n="28">For who would die to gratify a foe ?</l>
     <l n="29">His generous mind disdained so mean a fate ;</l>
     <l n="30">That passed , his next endeavour was to hate .</l>
     <l n="31">But vainer that relief than all the rest ; }</l>
     <l n="32">The less he hoped , with more desire possessed ; }</l>
     <l n="33">Love stood the siege , and would not yield his breast . }</l>
     <l n="34">Change was the next , but change deceived his care ;</l>
     <l n="35">He sought a fairer , but found none so fair .</l>
     <l n="36">He would have worn her out by slow degrees , }</l>
     <l n="37">As men by fasting starve the untamed disease ; }</l>
     <l n="38">But present love required a present ease . }</l>
     <l n="39">Looking , he feeds alone his famished eyes ,</l>
     <l n="40">Feeds lingering death ; but , looking not , he dies .</l>
     <l n="41">Yet still he chose the longest way to fate ,</l>
     <l n="42">Wasting at once his life , and his estate .</l>
     <l n="43">His friends beheld , and pitied him in vain ,</l>
     <l n="44">For what advice can ease a lover 's pain !</l>
     <l n="45">Absence , the best expedient they could find ,</l>
     <l n="46">Might save the fortune , if not cure the mind :</l>
     <l n="47">This means they long proposed , but little gained ,</l>
     <l n="48">Yet after much pursuit , at length obtained .</l>
     <l n="49">Hard you may think it was to give consent ,</l>
     <l n="50">But , struggling with his own desires , he went ;</l>
     <l n="51">With large expence , and with a pompous train , }</l>
     <l n="52">Provided as to visit France or Spain , }</l>
     <l n="53">Or for some distant voyage o'er the main . }</l>
     <l n="54">But love had clipped his wings , and cut him short ,</l>
     <l n="55">Confined within the purlieus of his court .</l>
     <l n="56">Three miles he went , nor farther could retreat ;</l>
     <l n="57">His travels ended at his country-seat :</l>
     <l n="58">To Chassis ’ pleasing plains he took his way ,</l>
     <l n="59">There pitched his tents , and there resolved to stay .</l>
     <l n="60">The spring was in the prime ; the neighbouring grove</l>
     <l n="61">Supplied by birds , the choristers of love ;</l>
     <l n="62">Music unbought , that ministered delight</l>
     <l n="63">To morning walks , and lulled his cares by night :</l>
     <l n="64">There he discharged his friends ; but not the expence</l>
     <l n="65">Of frequent treats , and proud magnificence .</l>
     <l n="66">He lived as kings retire , though more at large</l>
     <l n="67">From public business , yet with equal charge ;</l>
     <l n="68">With house and heart still open to receive ;</l>
     <l n="69">As well content as love would give him leave :</l>
     <l n="70">He would have lived more free ; but many a guest ,</l>
     <l n="71">Who could forsake the friend , pursued the feast .</l>
     <l n="72">It happ 'd one morning , as his fancy led ,</l>
     <l n="73">Before his usual hour he left his bed ,</l>
     <l n="74">To walk within a lonely lawn , that stood</l>
     <l n="75">On every side surrounded by the wood :</l>
     <l n="76">Alone he walked , to please his pensive mind ,</l>
     <l n="77">And sought the deepest solitude to find :</l>
     <l n="78">‘ Twas in a grove of spreading pines he strayed ; }</l>
     <l n="79">The winds within the quivering branches played , }</l>
     <l n="80">And dancing trees a mournful music made . }</l>
     <l n="81">The place itself was suiting to his care ,</l>
     <l n="82">Uncouth and savage , as the cruel fair .</l>
     <l n="83">He wandered on , unknowing where he went ,</l>
     <l n="84">Lost in the wood , and all on love intent :</l>
     <l n="85">The day already half his race had run , }</l>
     <l n="86">And summoned him to due repast at noon , }</l>
     <l n="87">But love could feel no hunger but his own . }</l>
     <l n="88">While listening to the murmuring leaves he stood ,</l>
     <l n="89">More than a mile immersed within the wood ,</l>
     <l n="90">At once the wind was laid ; the whispering sound</l>
     <l n="91">Was dumb ; a rising earthquake rocked the ground ;</l>
     <l n="92">With deeper brown the grove was overspread , }</l>
     <l n="93">A sudden horror seized his giddy head , }</l>
     <l n="94">And his ears tinkled , and his colour fled . }</l>
     <l n="95">Nature was in alarm ; some danger nigh</l>
     <l n="96">Seemed threatened , though unseen to mortal eye .</l>
     <l n="97">Unused to fear , he summoned all his soul ,</l>
     <l n="98">And stood collected in himself , and whole :</l>
     <l n="99">Not long ; for soon a whirlwind rose around ,</l>
     <l n="100">And from afar he heard a screaming sound ,</l>
     <l n="101">As of a dame distressed , who cried for aid ,</l>
     <l n="102">And filled with loud laments the secret shade .</l>
     <l n="103">A thicket close beside the grove there stood ,</l>
     <l n="104">With briers and brambles choked , and dwarfish wood :</l>
     <l n="105">From thence the noise , which now approaching near ,</l>
     <l n="106">With more distinguished notes invades his ear ;</l>
     <l n="107">He raised his head , and saw a beauteous maid ,</l>
     <l n="108">With hair dishevelled , issuing through the shade ;</l>
     <l n="109">Stripped of her clothes , and even those parts revealed ,</l>
     <l n="110">Which modest nature keeps from sight concealed .</l>
     <l n="111">Her face , her hands , her naked limbs , were torn ,</l>
     <l n="112">With passing through the brakes and prickly thorn ;</l>
     <l n="113">Two mastiffs gaunt and grim her flight pursued ,</l>
     <l n="114">And oft their fastened fangs in blood embrued :</l>
     <l n="115">Oft they came up , and pinched her tender side ,—</l>
     <l n="116">Mercy , O mercy ! heaven , she ran , and cried ;</l>
     <l n="117">When heaven was named , they loosed their hold again ;</l>
     <l n="118">Then sprung she forth , they followed her amain .</l>
     <l n="119">Not far behind , a knight of swarthy face ,</l>
     <l n="120">High on a coal-black steed pursued the chace ;</l>
     <l n="121">With flashing flames his ardent eyes were filled ,</l>
     <l n="122">And in his hand a naked sword he held :</l>
     <l n="123">He cheered the dogs to follow her who fled ,</l>
     <l n="124">And vowed revenge on her devoted head .</l>
     <l n="125">As Theodore was born of noble kind ,</l>
     <l n="126">The brutal action roused his manly mind ;</l>
     <l n="127">Moved with th ’ unworthy usage of the maid ,</l>
     <l n="128">He , though unarmed , resolved to give her aid .</l>
     <l n="129">A saplin pine he wrenched from out the ground ,</l>
     <l n="130">The readiest weapon that his fury found .</l>
     <l n="131">Thus furnished for offence , he crossed the way</l>
     <l n="132">Betwixt the graceless villain and his prey .</l>
     <l n="133">The knight came thundering on , but , from afar ,</l>
     <l n="134">Thus in imperious tone forbade the war :—</l>
     <l n="135">Cease , Theodore , to proffer vain relief ,</l>
     <l n="136">Nor stop the vengeance of so just a grief ;</l>
     <l n="137">But give me leave to seize my destined prey ,</l>
     <l n="138">And let eternal justice take the way :</l>
     <l n="139">I but revenge my fate , disdained , betrayed ,</l>
     <l n="140">And suffering death for this ungrateful maid .—</l>
     <l n="141">He said , at once dismounting from the steed ;</l>
     <l n="142">For now the hell-hounds with superior speed</l>
     <l n="143">Had reached the dame , and fastening on her side ,</l>
     <l n="144">The ground with issuing streams of purple dyed .</l>
     <l n="145">Stood Theodore surprised in deadly fright ,</l>
     <l n="146">With chattering teeth , and bristling hair upright ;</l>
     <l n="147">Yet armed with inborn worth ,— Whate'er , said he ,</l>
     <l n="148">Thou art , who know'st me better than I thee ,</l>
     <l n="149">Or prove thy rightful cause , or be defied .—</l>
     <l n="150">The spectre , fiercely staring , thus replied :</l>
     <l n="151">Know , Theodore , thy ancestry I claim ,</l>
     <l n="152">And Guido Cavalcanti was my name .</l>
     <l n="153">One common sire our fathers did beget ,</l>
     <l n="154">My name and story some remember yet :</l>
     <l n="155">Thee , then a boy , within my arms I laid ,</l>
     <l n="156">When for my sins I loved this haughty maid ;</l>
     <l n="157">Not less adored in life , nor served by me ,</l>
     <l n="158">Than proud Honoria now is loved by thee .</l>
     <l n="159">What did I not , her stubborn heart to gain ? }</l>
     <l n="160">But all my vows were answered with disdain ; }</l>
     <l n="161">She scorned my sorrows , and despised my pain . }</l>
     <l n="162">Long time I dragged my days in fruitless care ;</l>
     <l n="163">Then loathing life , and plunged in deep despair ,</l>
     <l n="164">To finish my unhappy life , I fell</l>
     <l n="165">On this sharp sword , and now am damned in hell .</l>
     <l n="166">Short was her joy ; for soon the insulting maid</l>
     <l n="167">By heaven 's decree in the cold grave was laid ;</l>
     <l n="168">And as in unrepented sin she died ,</l>
     <l n="169">Doomed to the same bad place , is punished for her pride ,</l>
     <l n="170">Because she deemed I well deserved to die ,</l>
     <l n="171">And made a merit of her cruelty .</l>
     <l n="172">There , then , we met ; both tried , and both were cast ,</l>
     <l n="173">And this irrevocable sentence passed ;</l>
     <l n="174">That she , whom I so long pursued in vain ,</l>
     <l n="175">Should suffer from my hands a lingering pain :</l>
     <l n="176">Renewed to life , that she might daily die ,</l>
     <l n="177">I daily doomed to follow , she to fly ;</l>
     <l n="178">No more a lover , but a mortal foe ,</l>
     <l n="179">I seek her life ( for love is none below ;)</l>
     <l n="180">As often as my dogs with better speed</l>
     <l n="181">Arrest her flight , is she to death decreed :</l>
     <l n="182">Then with this fatal sword , on which I died ,</l>
     <l n="183">I pierce her open back , or tender side ,</l>
     <l n="184">And tear that hardened heart from out her breast ,</l>
     <l n="185">Which , with her entrails , makes my hungry hounds a feast .</l>
     <l n="186">Nor lies she long , but as her fates ordain , }</l>
     <l n="187">Springs up to life , and , fresh to second pain , }</l>
     <l n="188">Is saved to-day , to-morrow to be slain — }</l>
     <l n="189">This , versed in death , the infernal knight relates ,</l>
     <l n="190">And then for proof fulfilled their common fates ;</l>
     <l n="191">Her heart and bowels through her back he drew ,</l>
     <l n="192">And fed the hounds that helped him to pursue .</l>
     <l n="193">Stern looked the fiend , as frustrate of his will ,</l>
     <l n="194">Not half sufficed , and greedy yet to kill .</l>
     <l n="195">And now the soul expiring through the wound ,</l>
     <l n="196">Had left the body breathless on the ground ,</l>
     <l n="197">When thus the grisly spectre spoke again :—</l>
     <l n="198">Behold the fruit of ill-rewarded pain !</l>
     <l n="199">As many months as I sustained her hate ,</l>
     <l n="200">So many years is she condemned by fate</l>
     <l n="201">To daily death ; and every several place ,</l>
     <l n="202">Conscious of her disdain , and my disgrace ,</l>
     <l n="203">Must witness her just punishment ; and be</l>
     <l n="204">A scene of triumph and revenge to me .</l>
     <l n="205">As in this grove I took my last farewell ,</l>
     <l n="206">As on this very spot of earth I fell ,</l>
     <l n="207">As Friday saw me die , so she my prey</l>
     <l n="208">Becomes even here , on this revolving day .—</l>
     <l n="209">Thus while he spoke , the virgin from the ground</l>
     <l n="210">Upstarted fresh , already closed the wound ,</l>
     <l n="211">And , unconcerned for all she felt before ,</l>
     <l n="212">Precipitates her flight along the shore :</l>
     <l n="213">The hell-hounds , as ungorged with flesh and blood ,</l>
     <l n="214">Pursue their prey , and seek their wonted food :</l>
     <l n="215">The fiend remounts his courser , mends his pace ,</l>
     <l n="216">And all the vision vanished from the place .</l>
     <l n="217">Long stood the noble youth oppressed with awe , }</l>
     <l n="218">And stupid at the wondrous things he saw , }</l>
     <l n="219">Surpassing common faith , transgressing nature 's law : }</l>
     <l n="220">He would have been asleep , and wished to wake ,</l>
     <l n="221">But dreams , he knew , no long impression make ,</l>
     <l n="222">Though strong at first ; if vision , to what end , }</l>
     <l n="223">But such as must his future state portend ? }</l>
     <l n="224">His love the damsel , and himself the fiend . }</l>
     <l n="225">But yet reflecting that it could not be</l>
     <l n="226">From heaven , which cannot impious acts decree ,</l>
     <l n="227">Resolved within himself to shun the snare ,</l>
     <l n="228">Which hell for his destruction did prepare ;</l>
     <l n="229">And as his better genius should direct ,</l>
     <l n="230">From an ill cause to draw a good effect .</l>
     <l n="231">Inspired from heaven , he homeward took his way ,</l>
     <l n="232">Nor palled his new design with long delay ;</l>
     <l n="233">But of his train a trusty servant sent ,</l>
     <l n="234">To call his friends together at his tent .</l>
     <l n="235">They came , and usual salutations paid ,</l>
     <l n="236">With words premeditated thus he said :—</l>
     <l n="237">What you have often counselled , to remove</l>
     <l n="238">My vain pursuit of unregarded love ,</l>
     <l n="239">By thrift my sinking fortune to repair ,</l>
     <l n="240">Though late , yet is at last become my care :</l>
     <l n="241">My heart shall be my own ; my vast expence</l>
     <l n="242">Reduced to bounds , by timely providence :</l>
     <l n="243">This only I require ; invite for me</l>
     <l n="244">Honoria , with her father 's family ,</l>
     <l n="245">Her friends , and mine , ( the cause I shall display ,)</l>
     <l n="246">On Friday next ; for that 's the appointed day .—</l>
     <l n="247">Well pleased were all his friends ; the task was light ,</l>
     <l n="248">The father , mother , daughter , they invite ;</l>
     <l n="249">Hardly the dame was drawn to this repast ,</l>
     <l n="250">But yet resolved , because it was the last .</l>
     <l n="251">The day was come , the guests invited came ,</l>
     <l n="252">And , with the rest , the inexorable dame :</l>
     <l n="253">A feast prepared with riotous expence ,</l>
     <l n="254">Much cost , more care , and more magnificence .</l>
     <l n="255">The place ordained was in that haunted grove ,</l>
     <l n="256">Where the revenging ghost pursued his love :</l>
     <l n="257">The tables in a proud pavilion spread ,</l>
     <l n="258">With flowers below , and tissue overhead :</l>
     <l n="259">The rest in rank , Honoria , chief in place , }</l>
     <l n="260">Was artfully contrived to set her face }</l>
     <l n="261">To front the thicket , and behold the chace . }</l>
     <l n="262">The feast was served , the time so well forecast ,</l>
     <l n="263">That just when the desert and fruits were placed ,</l>
     <l n="264">The fiend 's alarm began ; the hollow sound }</l>
     <l n="265">Sung in the leaves , the forest shook around , }</l>
     <l n="266">Air blackened , rolled the thunder , groaned the ground . }</l>
     <l n="267">Nor long before the loud laments arise ,</l>
     <l n="268">Of one distressed , and mastiffs ’ mingled cries ;</l>
     <l n="269">And first the dame came rushing through the wood , }</l>
     <l n="270">And next the famished hounds that sought their food , }</l>
     <l n="271">And griped her flanks , and oft essayed their jaws in blood . }</l>
     <l n="272">Last came the felon , on the sable steed ,</l>
     <l n="273">Armed with his naked sword , and urged his dogs to speed .</l>
     <l n="274">She ran , and cried , her flight directly bent , }</l>
     <l n="275">( A guest unbidden ) to the fatal tent , }</l>
     <l n="276">The scene of death , and place ordained for punishment . }</l>
     <l n="277">Loud was the noise , aghast was every guest ,</l>
     <l n="278">The women shrieked , the men forsook the feast ;</l>
     <l n="279">The hounds at nearer distance hoarsely bayed ; }</l>
     <l n="280">The hunter close pursued the visionary maid , }</l>
     <l n="281">She rent the heaven with loud laments , imploring aid . }</l>
     <l n="282">The gallants to protect the lady 's right , }</l>
     <l n="283">Their faulchions brandished at the grisly sprite ; }</l>
     <l n="284">High on his stirrups he provoked the fight . }</l>
     <l n="285">Then on the crowd he cast a furious look ,</l>
     <l n="286">And withered all their strength before he strook :—<span corresp="#note218" type="note_anchor">[ 218 ]</span></l>
     <l n="287">Back , on your lives ! let be , said he , my prey ,</l>
     <l n="288">And let my vengeance take the destined way :</l>
     <l n="289">Vain are your arms , and vainer your defence ,</l>
     <l n="290">Against the eternal doom of Providence :</l>
     <l n="291">Mine is the ungrateful maid by heaven designed ;</l>
     <l n="292">Mercy she would not give , nor mercy shall she find .—</l>
     <l n="293">At this the former tale again he told</l>
     <l n="294">With thundering tone , and dreadful to behold :</l>
     <l n="295">Sunk were their hearts with horror of the crime ,</l>
     <l n="296">Nor needed to be warned a second time ,</l>
     <l n="297">But bore each other back ; some knew the face , }</l>
     <l n="298">And all had heard the much-lamented case }</l>
     <l n="299">Of him who fell for love , and this the fatal place . }</l>
     <l n="300">And now the infernal minister advanced ,</l>
     <l n="301">Seized the due victim , and with fury lanced</l>
     <l n="302">Her back , and piercing through her inmost heart ,</l>
     <l n="303">Drew backward , as before , the offending part .</l>
     <l n="304">The reeking entrails next he tore away ,</l>
     <l n="305">And to his meagre mastiffs made a prey .</l>
     <l n="306">The pale assistants on each other stared ,</l>
     <l n="307">With gaping mouths for issuing words prepared ;</l>
     <l n="308">The still-born sounds upon the palate hung ,</l>
     <l n="309">And died imperfect on the faultering tongue .</l>
     <l n="310">The fright was general ; but the female band</l>
     <l n="311">( A helpless train ) in more confusion stand :</l>
     <l n="312">With horror shuddering , on a heap they run , }</l>
     <l n="313">Sick at the sight of hateful justice done ; }</l>
     <l n="314">For conscience rung the alarm , and made the case their own . }</l>
     <l n="315">So , spread upon a lake , with upward eye ,</l>
     <l n="316">A plump of fowl behold their foe on high ;</l>
     <l n="317">They close their trembling troop ; and all attend</l>
     <l n="318">On whom the sowsing eagle will descend .</l>
     <l n="319">But most the proud Honoria feared the event ,</l>
     <l n="320">And thought to her alone the vision sent .</l>
     <l n="321">Her guilt presents to her distracted mind }</l>
     <l n="322">Heaven 's justice , Theodore 's revengeful kind , }</l>
     <l n="323">And the same fate to the same sin assigned ; }</l>
     <l n="324">Already sees herself the monster 's prey ,</l>
     <l n="325">And feels her heart and entrails torn away .</l>
     <l n="326">‘ Twas a mute scene of sorrow , mixed with fear ;</l>
     <l n="327">Still on the table lay the unfinished cheer :</l>
     <l n="328">The knight and hungry mastiffs stood around ,</l>
     <l n="329">The mangled dame lay breathless on the ground ;</l>
     <l n="330">When on a sudden , re-inspired with breath ,</l>
     <l n="331">Again she rose , again to suffer death ;</l>
     <l n="332">Nor stayed the hell-hounds , nor the hunter stayed ,</l>
     <l n="333">But followed , as before , the flying maid :</l>
     <l n="334">The avenger took from earth the avenging sword ,</l>
     <l n="335">And mounting , light as air , his sable steed he spurred ;</l>
     <l n="336">The clouds dispelled , the sky resumed her light ,</l>
     <l n="337">And nature stood recovered of her fright .</l>
     <l n="338">But fear , the last of ills , remained behind ,</l>
     <l n="339">And horror heavy sat on every mind .</l>
     <l n="340">Nor Theodore encouraged more his feast ,</l>
     <l n="341">But sternly looked , as hatching in his breast</l>
     <l n="342">Some deep design ; which when Honoria viewed ,</l>
     <l n="343">The fresh impulse her former fright renewed :</l>
     <l n="344">She thought herself the trembling dame who fled ,</l>
     <l n="345">And him the grisly ghost that spurred the infernal steed :</l>
     <l n="346">The more dismayed , for when the guests withdrew , }</l>
     <l n="347">Their courteous host , saluting all the crew , }</l>
     <l n="348">Regardless passed her o'er , nor graced with kind adieu . }</l>
     <l n="349">That sting infixed within her haughty mind , }</l>
     <l n="350">The downfal of her empire she divined ; }</l>
     <l n="351">And her proud heart with secret sorrow pined . }</l>
     <l n="352">Home as they went , the sad discourse renewed , }</l>
     <l n="353">Of the relentless dame to death pursued , }</l>
     <l n="354">And of the sight obscene so lately viewed . }</l>
     <l n="355">None durst arraign the righteous doom she bore ;</l>
     <l n="356">Even they , who pitied most , yet blamed her more :</l>
     <l n="357">The parallel they needed not to name ,</l>
     <l n="358">But in the dead they damned the living dame .</l>
     <l n="359">At every little noise she looked behind ,</l>
     <l n="360">For still the knight was present to her mind :</l>
     <l n="361">And anxious oft she started on the way ,</l>
     <l n="362">And thought the horseman-ghost came thundering for his prey .</l>
     <l n="363">Returned , she took her bed , with little rest ,</l>
     <l n="364">But in short slumbers dreamt the funeral feast :</l>
     <l n="365">Awaked , she turned her side , and slept again ; }</l>
     <l n="366">The same black vapours mounted in her brain , }</l>

     <l n="382">She ceased all farther hope ; and now began</l>

     <l n="384">Rich , brave , and young , who past expression loved ,</l>
     <l n="385">Proof to disdain , and not to be removed :</l>

   <p>ORIGINAL , FROM THE DECAMERON .</p>
   <p>THE FIFTH DAY .</p>
   <p>NOVEL VIII .</p>
   <p>Anastasio being in love with a young lady , spent a good part of his fortune without being able to gain her affections . At the request of his relations he retires to Chiassi , where he sees a lady pursued and slain by a gentleman , and then given to the dogs to be devoured . He invites his friends , along with his mistress , to come and dine with him , when they see the same thing , and she , fearing the like punishment , takes him for her husband .</p>
   <p>When Lauretta had made an end , Philomena began , by the queen 's command , thus : Most gracious lady , as pity is a commendable quality in us , in like manner do we find cruelty most severely punished by divine justice ; which , that I may make plain to you all , and afford means to drive it from your hearts , I mean to relate a novel as full of compassion as it is agreeable .</p>
   <p>In Ravenna , an ancient city of Romagna , dwelt formerly many persons of quality ; amongst the rest was a young gentleman named Anastasio de gli Honesti , who , by the deaths of his father and uncle , was left immensely rich ; and , being a bachelor , fell in love with one of the daughters of Signor Paolo Traversaro ( of a family much superior to his own ) and was in hopes , by his constant application , to gain her affection : but though his endeavours were generous , noble , and praise-worthy , so far were they from succeeding , that , on the contrary , they rather turned out to his disadvantage ; and so cruel , and even savage , was the beloved fair one , ( either her singular beauty , or noble descent , having made her thus haughty and scornful ,) that neither he , nor any thing that he did , could ever please her . This so afflicted Anastasio , that he was going to lay violent hands upon himself ; but , thinking better of it , he frequently thought to leave her entirely ; or else to hate her , if he could , as much as she had hated him . But this proved a vain design ; for he constantly found that the less his hope , the greater always his love . Persevering then in his love and extravagant way of life , his friends looked upon him as destroying his constitution , as well as wasting his substance ; they therefore advised and entreated that he would leave the place , and go and live somewhere else ; for , by that means , he might lessen both his love and expence . For some time he made light of this advice , till being very much importuned , and not knowing how to refuse them , he promised to do so ; when , making extraordinary preparations , as if he was going some long journey either into France or Spain , he mounted his horse and left Ravenna , attended by many of his friends , and went to a place about three miles off , called Chiassi , where he ordered tents and pavilions to be brought , telling those who had accompanied him , that he meant to stay there , but that they might return to Ravenna . Here he lived in the most splendid manner , inviting sometimes this company , and sometimes that , both to dine and sup as he had used to do before . Now it happened in the beginning of May , the season being extremely pleasant , that , thinking of his cruel mistress , he ordered all his family to retire , and leave him to his own thoughts , when he walked along , step by step , and lost in reflection , till he came to a forest of pines . It being then the fifth hour of the day , and he advanced more than half a mile into the grove , without thinking either of his dinner , or any thing else but his love , on a sudden he seemed to hear a most grievous lamentation , with the loud shrieks of a woman : this put an end to his meditation , when , looking round him , to know what the matter was , he saw come out of a thicket full of briers and thorns , and run towards the place where he was , a most beautiful lady , naked , with her flesh all scratched and rent by the bushes , crying terribly , and begging for mercy : in close pursuit of her were two fierce mastiffs , biting and tearing wherever they could lay hold , and behind , upon a black steed , rode a gloomy knight , with a dagger in his hand , loading her with the bitterest imprecations . The sight struck him at once with wonder and consternation , as well as pity for the lady , whom he was desirous to rescue from such trouble and danger , if possible ; but finding himself without arms , he seized the branch of a tree , instead of a truncheon , and went forward with it , to oppose both the dogs and the knight . The knight observing this , called out , afar off , “ Anastasio , do not concern thyself ; but leave the dogs and me to do by this wicked woman as she has deserved . ” At these words the dogs laid hold of her , and he coming up to them , dismounted from his horse . Anastasio then stept up to him , and said , “ I know not who you are , that are acquainted thus with me ; but I must tell you , that it is a most villainous action for a man armed as you are to pursue a naked woman , and to set dogs upon her also , as if she were a wild beast ; be assured , that I shall defend her to the utmost of my power . ” The knight replied , “ I was once your countryman , when you were but a child , and was called Guido de gli Anastagi , at which time I was more enamoured with this woman , than ever you were with Traversaro 's daughter ; but she treated me so cruelly , and with so much insolence , that I killed myself with this dagger which you now see in my hand , for which I am doomed to eternal punishment . Soon afterwards she , who was over and above rejoiced at my death , died likewise , and for that cruelty , as also for the joy which she expressed at my misery , she is condemned as well as myself ; our sentences are for her to flee before me , and for me , who loved her so well , to pursue her as a mortal enemy ; and when I overtake her , with this dagger , with which I murdered myself , do I murder her ; then I open her through the back , and take out that hard and cold heart , which neither love nor pity could pierce , with all her entrails , and throw them to the dogs ; and in a little time ( so wills the justice and power of heaven ) she rises , as though she had never been dead , and renews her miserable flight , whilst we pursue her over again . Every Friday in the year , about this time , do I sacrifice her here , as you see , and on other days in other places , where she has ever thought or done any thing against me ; and thus being from a lover become her mortal enemy , I am to follow her as many years as she was cruel to me months . Then let the divine justice take its course , nor offer to oppose what you are no way able to withstand . ” Anastasio drew back at these words , terrified to death , and waited to see what the other was going to do : who having made an end of speaking , ran at her with the utmost fury , as she was seized by the dogs , and kneeled down begging for mercy , when with his dagger he pierced through her breast , drawing forth her heart and entrails , which they immediately , as if half famished , devoured . And in a little time she rose again , as if nothing had happened , and fled towards the sea , the dogs biting and tearing her all the way , the knight also being remounted , and taking his dagger , pursued her as before , till they soon got out of sight . Upon seeing these things , Anastasio stood divided betwixt fear and pity , and at length it came into his mind that , as it happened always on a Friday , it might be of particular use . Returning then to his servants , he sent for some of his friends and relations , when he said to them , “ You have often importuned me to leave off loving this my enemy , and to contract my expences ; I am ready to do so , provided you grant me one favour , which is this , that next Friday , you engage Paolo Traversaro , his wife and daughter , with all their women-friends and relations to come and dine with me : the reason of my requiring this you will see at that time . ” This seemed to them a small matter , and returning to Ravenna they invited all those whom he had desired , and though they found it difficult to prevail upon the young lady , yet the others carried her at last along with them . Anastasio had provided a magnificent entertainment in the grove where that spectacle had lately been ; and , having seated all his company , he contrived that the lady should sit directly opposite to the scene of action . The last course then was no sooner served up , but the lady 's shrieks began to be heard . This surprised them all , and they began to enquire what it was , and , as nobody could inform them , they all arose ; when immediately they saw the lady , dogs , and knight , who were soon amongst them . Great was consequently the clamour , both against the dogs and knight , and many of them went to her assistance . But the knight made the same harangue to them , that he had done to Anastasio , which terrified and filled them with wonder ; whilst he acted the same part over again , the ladies , of whom there were many present , related to both the knight and lady , who remembered his love and unhappy death , all lamenting as much as if it happened to themselves . This tragical affair being ended , and the lady and knight both gone away , they had various arguments together about it ; but none seemed so much affected as Anastasio 's mistress , who had heard and seen every thing distinctly , and was sensible that it concerned her more than any other person , calling to mind her usage of and cruelty towards him ; so that she seemed to flee before him all incensed , with the mastiffs at her heels ; and her terror was such , lest this should ever happen to her , that , turning her hatred into love , she sent that very evening a trusty damsel privately to him , who entreated him in her name to come to see her , for that she was ready to fulfil his desires . Anastasio replied , that nothing could be more agreeable to him ; but that he desired no favour from her , but what was consistent with her honour . The lady , who was sensible that it had been always her fault they were not married , answered , that she was willing ; and going herself to her father and mother , she acquainted them with her intention . This gave them the utmost satisfaction ; and the next Sunday the marriage was solemnized with all possible demonstrations of joy . And that spectacle was not attended with this good alone ; but all the women of Ravenna , for the time to come , were so terrified with it , that they were more ready to listen to , and oblige the men , than ever they had been before .</p>
   <p>CYMON AND IPHIGENIA .</p>
   <p>Beroaldus , who translated this novel into Latin , and published it in Paris in 1499 , affirms , that it is taken from the annals of the kingdom of Cyprus ; and from his intimacy with Hugo IV ., king of that island , may perhaps have had grounds for saying so , besides Boccaccio 's own allegation to the same effect . Whether entirely fictitious , or grounded upon historical fact , it is one of those novels which have added most to the reputation of the “ Decameron ; ” nor has the version of Dryden been the least admired among his poems . This popularity seems entirely due to the primary incident , the reforming of Cymon from his barbarism and idiocy , by the influence of a passion , which almost all have felt at one period of their life , and love to read and hear of ever afterwards . Perhaps the original idea of Cymon 's conversion is to be found in the Idyl of Theocritus , entitled ΒΟΥΚΟΛΙΣΚΟΣ . There is not in our language a strain of more beautiful and melodious poetry , than that so often quoted , in which Dryden describes the sleeping nymph , and the effect of her beauty upon the clownish Cymon . But it is only sufficient to mention that passage , to recal it to the recollection of every general reader , and of most who have read any poetry at all . The narrative , it must be confessed , is otherwise inartificial , and bears little proportion , or even reference , to this most striking and original incident . Cymon might have carried off Iphigene , and all the changes of fortune which afterwards take place might have happened , though his love had commenced in an ordinary manner ; nor is there any thing in his character or mode of conduct , which calls back to our recollection , his having such a miraculous instance of the power of love . In short , in the progress of the tale , we quite lose sight of its original and striking commencement ; nor do we find much compensation by the introduction of the new actor Lysander , with whose passion and disappointment we have little sympathy ; and whose expedients , as Dryden plainly confesses , are no other than an abuse of his public office by the commission of murder and rape . These are perhaps too critical objections to a story , which Dryden took from Boccaccio , as Boccaccio had probably taken it from some old annalist , as containing a striking instance of the power of the gentler affections , in regulating and refining the human mind , and a curious illustration of the mutability of fortune , in the subsequent incidents attending the loves of Cymon and Iphigene .</p>
   <p>Dryden , in the introductory verses , has hazarded a more direct attack upon Collier , than his consciousness of having merited his accusations had yet permitted him to bring forward .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="43">In that sweet isle where Venus keeps her court ,</l>
     <l n="44">And every grace , and all the loves , resort ;</l>
     <l n="45">Where either sex is formed of softer earth ,</l>
     <l n="46">And takes the bent of pleasure from their birth ;</l>
     <l n="47">There lived a Cyprian lord above the rest ,</l>
     <l n="48">Wise , wealthy , with a numerous issue blessed .</l>
     <l n="49">But as no gift of fortune is sincere ,</l>
     <l n="50">Was only wanting in a worthy heir ;</l>
     <l n="51">His eldest born , a goodly youth to view ,</l>
     <l n="52">Excelled the rest in shape , and outward shew ;</l>
     <l n="53">Fair , tall , his limbs with due proportion joined ,</l>
     <l n="54">But of a heavy , dull , degenerate mind .</l>
     <l n="55">His soul belied the features of his face ;</l>
     <l n="56">Beauty was there , but beauty in disgrace .</l>
     <l n="57">A clownish mein , a voice with rustic sound ,</l>
     <l n="58">And stupid eyes that ever loved the ground .</l>
     <l n="59">He looked like nature 's error , as the mind }</l>
     <l n="60">And body were not of a piece designed , }</l>
     <l n="61">But made for two , and by mistake in one were joined . }</l>
     <l n="62">The ruling rod , the father 's forming care ,</l>
     <l n="63">Were exercised in vain on wit 's despair ;</l>
     <l n="64">The more informed , the less he understood ,</l>
     <l n="65">And deeper sunk by floundering in the mud .</l>
     <l n="66">Now scorned of all , and grown the public shame ,</l>
     <l n="67">The people from Galesus changed his name ,</l>
     <l n="68">And Cymon called , which signifies a brute ;</l>
     <l n="69">So well his name did with his nature suit .</l>
     <l n="70">His father , when he found his labour lost ,</l>
     <l n="71">And care employed , that answered not the cost ,</l>
     <l n="72">Chose an ungrateful object to remove ,</l>
     <l n="73">And loathed to see what nature made him love ;</l>
     <l n="74">So to his country farm the fool confined ;</l>
     <l n="75">Rude work well suited with a rustic mind .</l>
     <l n="76">Thus to the wilds the sturdy Cymon went ,</l>
     <l n="77">A squire among the swains , and pleased with banishment .</l>
     <l n="78">His corn and cattle were his only care ,</l>
     <l n="79">And his supreme delight , a country fair .</l>
     <l n="80">It happened on a summer 's holiday , }</l>
     <l n="81">That to the green-wood shade he took his way ; }</l>
     <l n="82">For Cymon shunned the church , and used not much to pray . }</l>
     <l n="83">His quarter-staff , which he could ne'er forsake ,</l>
     <l n="84">Hung half before , and half behind his back .</l>
     <l n="85">He trudged along , unknowing what he sought ,</l>
     <l n="86">And whistled as he went , for want of thought .</l>
     <l n="87">By chance conducted , or by thirst constrained ,</l>
     <l n="88">The deep recesses of the grove he gained ;</l>
     <l n="89">Where in a plain defended by the wood , }</l>
     <l n="90">Crept through the matted grass a crystal flood , }</l>
     <l n="91">By which an alabaster fountain stood ; }</l>
     <l n="92">And on the margin of the fount was laid ,</l>
     <l n="93">( Attended by her slaves ) a sleeping maid .</l>
     <l n="94">Like Dian and her nymphs , when , tired with sport ,</l>
     <l n="95">To rest by cool Eurotas they resort .</l>
     <l n="96">The dame herself the goddess well expressed ,</l>
     <l n="97">Not more distinguished by her purple vest ,</l>
     <l n="98">Than by the charming features of her face ,</l>
     <l n="99">And even in slumber a superior grace ;</l>
     <l n="100">Her comely limbs composed with decent care , }</l>
     <l n="101">Her body shaded with a slight cymarr ; }</l>
     <l n="102">Her bosom to the view was only bare ; }</l>
     <l n="103">Where two beginning paps were scarcely spied ,</l>
     <l n="104">For yet their places were but signified :</l>
     <l n="105">The fanning wind upon her bosom blows , }</l>
     <l n="106">To meet the fanning wind the bosom rose ; }</l>
     <l n="107">The fanning wind , and purling streams , continue her repose . }</l>
     <l n="108">The fool of nature stood with stupid eyes ,</l>
     <l n="109">And gaping mouth , that testified surprise ,</l>
     <l n="110">Fixed on her face , nor could remove his sight ,</l>
     <l n="111">New as he was to love , and novice in delight ;</l>
     <l n="112">Long mute he stood , and , leaning on his staff ,</l>
     <l n="113">His wonder witnessed with an idiot laugh ;</l>
     <l n="114">Then would have spoke , but by his glimmering sense ,</l>
     <l n="115">First found his want of words , and feared offence ;</l>
     <l n="116">Doubted for what he was he should be known ,</l>
     <l n="117">By his clown accent , and his country tone .</l>
     <l n="118">Through the rude chaos thus the running light</l>
     <l n="119">Shot the first ray that pierced the native night ;</l>
     <l n="120">Then day and darkness in the mass were mixed ,</l>
     <l n="121">Till gathered in a globe the beams were fixed ;</l>
     <l n="122">Last shone the sun , who , radiant in his sphere ,</l>
     <l n="123">Illumined heaven and earth , and rolled around the year .</l>
     <l n="124">So reason in this brutal soul began :</l>
     <l n="125">Love made him first suspect he was a man ;</l>
     <l n="126">Love made him doubt his broad barbarian sound ;</l>
     <l n="127">By love his want of words , and wit , he found ;</l>
     <l n="128">That sense of want prepared the future way</l>
     <l n="129">To knowledge , and disclosed the promise of a day .</l>
     <l n="130">What not his father 's care , nor tutor 's art ,</l>
     <l n="131">Could plant with pains in his unpolished heart ,</l>
     <l n="132">The best instructor , love , at once inspired ,</l>
     <l n="133">As barren grounds to fruitfulness are fired ;</l>
     <l n="134">Love taught him shame , and shame , with love at strife ,</l>
     <l n="135">Soon taught the sweet civilities of life .</l>
     <l n="136">His gross material soul at once could find</l>
     <l n="137">Somewhat in her excelling all her kind ;</l>
     <l n="138">Exciting a desire till then unknown ,</l>
     <l n="139">Somewhat unfound , or found in her alone .</l>
     <l n="140">This made the first impression in his mind ,</l>
     <l n="141">Above , but just above , the brutal kind .</l>
     <l n="142">For beasts can like , but not distinguish too ,</l>
     <l n="143">Nor their own liking by reflection know ;</l>
     <l n="144">Nor why they like or this or t'other face ,</l>
     <l n="145">Or judge of this , or that peculiar grace ;</l>
     <l n="146">But love in gross , and stupidly admire ;</l>
     <l n="147">As flies , allured by light , approach the fire .</l>
     <l n="148">Thus our man-beast , advancing by degrees ,</l>
     <l n="149">First likes the whole , then separates what he sees ;</l>
     <l n="150">On several parts a several praise bestows ,</l>
     <l n="151">The ruby lips , the well-proportioned nose ,</l>
     <l n="152">The snowy skin , the raven-glossy hair , }</l>
     <l n="153">The dimpled cheek , the forehead rising fair , }</l>
     <l n="154">And even in sleep itself , a smiling air . }</l>
     <l n="155">From thence his eyes descending viewed the rest ,</l>
     <l n="156">Her plump round arms , white hands , and heaving breast .</l>
     <l n="157">Long on the last he dwelt , though every part</l>
     <l n="158">A pointed arrow sped to pierce his heart .</l>
     <l n="159">Thus in a trice a judge of beauty grown ,</l>
     <l n="160">( A judge erected from a country clown ,)</l>
     <l n="161">He longed to see her eyes , in slumber hid ,</l>
     <l n="162">And wished his own could pierce within the lid :</l>
     <l n="163">He would have waked her , but restrained his thought ,</l>
     <l n="164">And love new-born the first good manners taught .</l>
     <l n="165">An awful fear his ardent wish withstood ,</l>
     <l n="166">Nor durst disturb the goddess of the wood ;</l>
     <l n="167">For such she seemed by her celestial face ,</l>
     <l n="168">Excelling all the rest of human race ;</l>
     <l n="169">And things divine , by common sense he knew ,</l>
     <l n="170">Must be devoutly seen at distant view :</l>
     <l n="171">So checking his desire , with trembling heart</l>
     <l n="172">Gazing he stood , nor would , nor could depart ;</l>
     <l n="173">Fixed as a pilgrim wildered in his way , }</l>
     <l n="174">Who dares not stir by night , for fear to stray , }</l>
     <l n="175">But stands with awful eyes to watch the dawn of day . }</l>
     <l n="176">At length awaking , Iphigene the fair ,</l>
     <l n="177">( So was the beauty called , who caused his care ,)</l>
     <l n="178">Unclosed her eyes , and double day revealed ,</l>
     <l n="179">While those of all her slaves in sleep were sealed .</l>
     <l n="180">The slavering cudden , propped upon his staff ,</l>
     <l n="181">Stood ready gaping with a grinning laugh ,</l>
     <l n="182">To welcome her awake , nor durst begin</l>
     <l n="183">To speak , but wisely kept the fool within .</l>
     <l n="184">Then she ; What make you , Cymon , here alone ?—</l>
     <l n="185">For Cymon 's name was round the country known ,</l>
     <l n="186">Because descended of a noble race ,</l>
     <l n="187">( And for a soul ill sorted with his face . )</l>
     <l n="188">But still the sot stood silent with surprise ,</l>
     <l n="189">With fixed regard on her new-opened eyes ,</l>
     <l n="190">And in his breast received the envenomed dart ,</l>
     <l n="191">A tickling pain that pleased amid the smart .</l>
     <l n="192">But conscious of her form , with quick distrust</l>
     <l n="193">She saw his sparkling eyes , and feared his brutal lust ;</l>
     <l n="194">This to prevent , she waked her sleepy crew ,</l>
     <l n="195">And , rising hasty , took a short adieu .</l>
     <l n="196">Then Cymon first his rustic voice essayed ,</l>
     <l n="197">With proffered service to the parting maid</l>
     <l n="198">To see her safe ; his hand she long denied ,</l>
     <l n="199">But took at length , ashamed of such a guide .</l>
     <l n="200">So Cymon led her home , and leaving there ,</l>
     <l n="201">No more would to his country clowns repair ,</l>
     <l n="202">But sought his father 's house , with better mind ,</l>
     <l n="203">Refusing in the farm to be confined .</l>
     <l n="204">The father wondered at the son 's return ,</l>
     <l n="205">And knew not whether to rejoice or mourn ;</l>
     <l n="206">But doubtfully received , expecting still</l>
     <l n="207">To learn the secret causes of his altered will .</l>
     <l n="208">Nor was he long delayed ; the first request }</l>
     <l n="209">He made , was like his brothers to be dress 'd , }</l>
     <l n="210">And , as his birth required , above the rest . }</l>
     <l n="211">With ease his suit was granted by his sire ,</l>
     <l n="212">Distinguishing his heir by rich attire :</l>
     <l n="213">His body thus adorned , he next designed</l>
     <l n="214">With liberal arts to cultivate his mind ;</l>
     <l n="215">He sought a tutor of his own accord ,</l>
     <l n="216">And studied lessons he before abhorred .</l>
     <l n="217">Thus the man-child advanced , and learned so fast ,</l>
     <l n="218">That in short time his equals he surpassed :</l>
     <l n="219">His brutal manners from his breast exiled ,</l>
     <l n="220">His mien he fashioned , and his tongue he filed ;</l>
     <l n="221">In every exercise of all admired ,</l>
     <l n="222">He seemed , nor only seemed , but was inspired ;</l>
     <l n="223">Inspired by love , whose business is to please ;</l>
     <l n="224">He rode , he fenced , he moved with graceful ease ,</l>
     <l n="225">More famed for sense , for courtly carriage more ,</l>
     <l n="226">Than for his brutal folly known before .</l>
     <l n="227">What then of altered Cymon shall we say ,</l>
     <l n="228">But that the fire which choked in ashes lay ,</l>
     <l n="229">A load too heavy for his soul to move ,</l>
     <l n="230">Was upward blown below , and brushed away by love .</l>
     <l n="231">Love made an active progress through his mind ,</l>
     <l n="232">The dusky parts he cleared , the gross refined ,</l>
     <l n="233">The drowsy waked ; and , as he went , impressed</l>
     <l n="234">The Maker 's image on the human breast .</l>
     <l n="235">Thus was the man amended by desire ,</l>
     <l n="236">And , though he loved perhaps with too much fire ,</l>
     <l n="237">His father all his faults with reason scan 'd ,</l>
     <l n="238">And liked an error of the better hand ;</l>
     <l n="239">Excused the excess of passion in his mind ,</l>
     <l n="240">By flames too fierce , perhaps too much refined ;</l>
     <l n="241">So Cymon , since his sire indulged his will ,</l>
     <l n="242">Impetuous loved , and would be Cymon still ;</l>
     <l n="243">Galesus he disowned , and chose to bear</l>
     <l n="244">The name of fool , confirmed and bishoped by the fair .</l>
     <l n="245">To Cipseus by his friends his suit he moved ,</l>
     <l n="246">Cipseus , the father of the fair he loved ;</l>
     <l n="247">But he was pre-engaged by former ties ,</l>
     <l n="248">While Cymon was endeavouring to be wise ;</l>
     <l n="249">And Iphigene , obliged by former vows ,</l>
     <l n="250">Had given her faith to wed a foreign spouse :</l>
     <l n="251">Her sire and she to Rhodian Pasimond ,</l>
     <l n="252">Though both repenting , were by promise bound ,</l>
     <l n="253">Nor could retract ; and thus , as fate decreed ,</l>
     <l n="254">Though better loved , he spoke too late to speed .</l>
     <l n="255">The doom was past ; the ship already sent</l>
     <l n="256">Did all his tardy diligence prevent ;</l>
     <l n="257">Sighed to herself the fair unhappy maid ,</l>
     <l n="258">While stormy Cymon thus in secret said :—</l>
     <l n="259">The time is come for Iphigene to find</l>
     <l n="260">The miracle she wrought upon my mind ;</l>
     <l n="261">Her charms have made me man , her ravished love</l>
     <l n="262">In rank shall place me with the blessed above .</l>
     <l n="263">For mine by love , by force she shall be mine ,</l>
     <l n="264">Or death , if force should fail , shall finish my design .—</l>
     <l n="265">Resolved he said ; and rigged with speedy care</l>
     <l n="266">A vessel strong , and well equipped for war .</l>
     <l n="267">The secret ship with chosen friends he stored ;</l>
     <l n="268">And bent to die , or conquer , went aboard .</l>
     <l n="269">Ambushed he lay behind the Cyprian shore ,</l>
     <l n="270">Waiting the sail that all his wishes bore ;</l>
     <l n="271">Nor long expected , for the following tide</l>
     <l n="272">Sent out the hostile ship and beauteous bride .</l>
     <l n="273">To Rhodes the rival bark directly steered ,</l>
     <l n="274">When Cymon sudden at her back appeared ,</l>
     <l n="275">And stopped her flight ; then standing on his prow ,</l>
     <l n="276">In haughty terms he thus defied the foe :—</l>
     <l n="277">Or strike your sails at summons , or prepare</l>
     <l n="278">To prove the last extremities of war .—</l>
     <l n="279">Thus warned , the Rhodians for the fight provide ; }</l>
     <l n="280">Already were the vessels side by side , }</l>
     <l n="281">These obstinate to save , and those to seize the bride . }</l>
     <l n="282">But Cymon soon his crooked grapples cast , }</l>
     <l n="283">Which with tenacious hold his foes embraced , }</l>
     <l n="284">And , armed with sword and shield , amid the press he passed . }</l>
     <l n="285">Fierce was the fight , but , hastening to his prey ,</l>
     <l n="286">By force the furious lover freed his way ;</l>
     <l n="287">Himself alone dispersed the Rhodian crew ,</l>
     <l n="288">The weak disdained , the valiant overthrew ;</l>
     <l n="289">Cheap conquest for his following friends remained ,</l>
     <l n="290">He reaped the field , and they but only gleaned .</l>
     <l n="291">His victory confessed , the foes retreat ,</l>
     <l n="292">And cast their weapons at the victor 's feet .</l>
     <l n="293">Whom thus he cheared :— O Rhodian youth , I fought</l>
     <l n="294">For love alone , nor other booty sought ;</l>
     <l n="295">Your lives are safe ; your vessel I resign ,</l>
     <l n="296">Yours be your own , restoring what is mine :</l>
     <l n="297">In Iphigene I claim my rightful due ,</l>
     <l n="298">Robbed by my rival , and detained by you ;</l>
     <l n="299">Your Pasimond a lawless bargain drove ,</l>
     <l n="300">The parent could not sell the daughter 's love ;</l>
     <l n="301">Or if he could , my love disdains the laws ,</l>
     <l n="302">And , like a king , by conquest gains his cause ;</l>
     <l n="303">Where arms take place , all other pleas are vain ,</l>
     <l n="304">Love taught me force , and force shall love maintain .</l>
     <l n="305">You , what by strength you could not keep , release ,</l>
     <l n="306">And at an easy ransom buy your peace .—</l>
     <l n="307">Fear on the conquered side soon signed the accord ,</l>
     <l n="308">And Iphigene to Cymon was restored .</l>
     <l n="309">While to his arms the blushing bride he took ,</l>
     <l n="310">To seeming sadness she composed her look ;</l>
     <l n="311">As if by force subjected to his will ,</l>
     <l n="312">Though pleased , dissembling , and a woman still .</l>
     <l n="313">And , for she wept , he wiped her falling tears ,</l>
     <l n="314">And prayed her to dismiss her empty fears ;—</l>
     <l n="315">For yours I am , he said , and have deserved</l>
     <l n="316">Your love much better whom so long I served ,</l>
     <l n="317">Than he to whom your formal father tied</l>
     <l n="318">Your vows , and sold a slave , not sent a bride .—</l>
     <l n="319">Thus while he spoke , he seized the willing prey ,</l>
     <l n="320">As Paris bore the Spartan spouse away .</l>
     <l n="321">Faintly she screamed , and even her eyes confessed</l>
     <l n="322">She rather would be thought , than was , distressed .</l>
     <l n="323">Who now exults but Cymon in his mind ? }</l>
     <l n="324">Vain hopes and empty joys of human kind , }</l>
     <l n="325">Proud of the present , to the future blind ! }</l>
     <l n="326">Secure of fate , while Cymon plows the sea ,</l>
     <l n="327">And steers to Candy with his conquered prey ,</l>
     <l n="328">Scarce the third glass of measured hours was run ,</l>
     <l n="329">When like a fiery meteor sunk the sun ,</l>
     <l n="330">The promise of a storm ; the shifting gales</l>
     <l n="331">Forsake by fits , and fill , the flagging sails ;</l>
     <l n="332">Hoarse murmurs of the main from far were heard ,</l>
     <l n="333">And night came on , not by degrees prepared ,</l>
     <l n="334">But all at once ; at once the winds arise ,</l>
     <l n="335">The thunders roll , the forky lightning flies .</l>
     <l n="336">In vain the master issues out commands ,</l>
     <l n="337">In vain the trembling sailors ply their hands ;</l>
     <l n="338">The tempest unforeseen prevents their care ,</l>
     <l n="339">And from the first they labour in despair .</l>
     <l n="340">The giddy ship , betwixt the winds and tides</l>
     <l n="341">Forced back and forwards , in a circle rides ,</l>
     <l n="342">Stunned with the different blows ; then shoots amain ,</l>
     <l n="343">Till , counterbuffed , she stops , and sleeps again .</l>
     <l n="344">Not more aghast the proud archangel fell ,</l>
     <l n="345">Plunged from the height of heaven to deepest hell ,</l>
     <l n="346">Than stood the lover of his love possessed ,</l>
     <l n="347">Now cursed the more , the more he had been blessed ;</l>
     <l n="348">More anxious for her danger , than his own ,</l>
     <l n="349">Death he defies , but would be lost alone .</l>
     <l n="350">Sad Iphigene to womanish complaints</l>
     <l n="351">Adds pious prayers , and wearies all the saints ;</l>
     <l n="352">Even , if she could , her love she would repent ,</l>
     <l n="353">But since she cannot , dreads the punishment :</l>
     <l n="354">Her forfeit faith , and Pasimond betrayed ,</l>
     <l n="355">Are ever present , and her crime upbraid .</l>
     <l n="356">She blames herself , nor blames her lover less ,</l>
     <l n="357">Augments her anger , as her fears increase :</l>
     <l n="358">From her own back the burden would remove ,</l>
     <l n="359">And lays the load on his ungoverned love ,</l>
     <l n="360">Which interposing durst , in heaven 's despite ,</l>
     <l n="361">Invade , and violate another 's right :</l>
     <l n="362">The powers incensed awhile deferred his pain ,</l>
     <l n="363">And made him master of his vows in vain :</l>
     <l n="364">But soon they punished his presumptuous pride , }</l>
     <l n="365">That for his daring enterprise she died , }</l>
     <l n="366">Who rather not resisted , than complied . }</l>
     <l n="367">Then , impotent of mind , with altered sense ,</l>
     <l n="368">She hugged the offender , and forgave the offence ,</l>
     <l n="369">Sex to the last : meantime with sails declined</l>
     <l n="370">The wandering vessel drove before the wind :</l>
     <l n="371">Tossed and retossed , aloft , and then alow , }</l>
     <l n="372">Nor port they seek , nor certain course they know , }</l>
     <l n="373">But every moment wait the coming blow . }</l>
     <l n="374">Thus blindly driven , by breaking day they viewed</l>
     <l n="375">The land before them , and their fears renewed ;</l>
     <l n="376">The land was welcome , but the tempest bore</l>
     <l n="377">The threatened ship against a rocky shore .</l>
     <l n="378">A winding bay was near ; to this they bent ,</l>
     <l n="379">And just escaped ; their force already spent :</l>
     <l n="380">Secure from storms , and panting from the sea ,</l>
     <l n="381">The land unknown at leisure they survey ;</l>
     <l n="382">And saw ( but soon their sickly sight withdrew )</l>
     <l n="383">The rising towers of Rhodes at distant view ;</l>
     <l n="384">And cursed the hostile shore of Pasimond ,</l>
     <l n="385">Saved from the seas , and shipwrecked on the ground .</l>
     <l n="386">The frighted sailors tried their strength in vain</l>
     <l n="387">To turn the stern , and tempt the stormy main ;</l>
     <l n="388">But the stiff wind withstood the labouring oar ,</l>
     <l n="389">And forced them forward on the fatal shore !</l>
     <l n="390">The crooked keel now bites the Rhodian strand ,</l>
     <l n="391">And the ship moored constrains the crew to land :</l>
     <l n="392">Yet still they might be safe , because unknown ;</l>
     <l n="393">But , as ill fortune seldom comes alone ,</l>
     <l n="394">The vessel they dismissed was driven before ,</l>
     <l n="395">Already sheltered on their native shore ;</l>
     <l n="396">Known each , they know , but each with change of chear ;</l>
     <l n="397">The vanquished side exults , the victors fear ;</l>
     <l n="398">Not them but theirs , made prisoners ere they fight ,</l>
     <l n="399">Despairing conquest , and deprived of flight .</l>
     <l n="400">The country rings around with loud alarms ,</l>
     <l n="401">And raw in fields the rude militia swarms ;<span corresp="#note220" type="note_anchor">[ 220 ]</span></l>
     <l n="402">Mouths without hands ; maintained at vast expence ,</l>
     <l n="403">In peace a charge , in war a weak defence ;</l>
     <l n="404">Stout once a month they march , a blustering band ,</l>
     <l n="405">And ever , but in times of need , at hand :</l>
     <l n="406">This was the morn when , issuing on the guard ,</l>
     <l n="407">Drawn up in rank and file they stood prepared</l>
     <l n="408">Of seeming arms to make a short essay ,</l>
     <l n="409">Then hasten to be drunk , the business of the day .</l>
     <l n="410">The cowards would have fled , but that they knew</l>
     <l n="411">Themselves so many , and their foes so few ;</l>
     <l n="412">But , crowding on , the last the first impel ,</l>
     <l n="413">Till overborne with weight the Cyprians fell ;</l>
     <l n="414">Cymon enslaved , who first the war begun ,</l>
     <l n="415">And Iphigene once more is lost and won .</l>
     <l n="416">Deep in a dungeon was the captive cast ,</l>
     <l n="417">Deprived of day , and held in fetters fast ;</l>
     <l n="418">His life was only spared at their request ,</l>
     <l n="419">Whom taken he so nobly had released :</l>
     <l n="420">But Iphigenia was the ladies care , }</l>
     <l n="421">Each in their turn addressed to treat the fair ; }</l>
     <l n="422">While Pasimond and his the nuptial feast prepare . }</l>
     <l n="423">Her secret soul to Cymon was inclined , }</l>
     <l n="424">But she must suffer what her fates assigned ; }</l>
     <l n="425">So passive is the church of womankind . }</l>
     <l n="426">What worse to Cymon could his fortune deal ,</l>
     <l n="427">Rolled to the lowest spoke of all her wheel ?</l>
     <l n="428">It rested to dismiss the downward weight ,</l>
     <l n="429">Or raise him upward to his former height :</l>
     <l n="430">The latter pleased ; and love ( concerned the most )</l>
     <l n="431">Prepared the amends , for what by love he lost .</l>
     <l n="432">The sire of Pasimond had left a son ,</l>
     <l n="433">Though younger , yet for courage early known ,</l>
     <l n="434">Ormisda called , to whom by promise tied ,</l>
     <l n="435">A Rhodian beauty was the destined bride ;</l>
     <l n="436">Cassandra was her name , above the rest</l>
     <l n="437">Renowned for birth , with fortune amply blessed .</l>
     <l n="438">Lysimachus , who ruled the Rhodian state ,</l>
     <l n="439">Was then by choice their annual magistrate :</l>
     <l n="440">He loved Cassandra too with equal fire ,</l>
     <l n="441">But fortune had not favoured his desire ;</l>
     <l n="442">Crossed by her friends , by her not disapproved ,</l>
     <l n="443">Nor yet preferred , or like Ormisda loved :</l>
     <l n="444">So stood the affair ; some little hope remained ,</l>
     <l n="445">That , should his rival chance to lose , he gained .</l>
     <l n="446">Meantime young Pasimond his marriage pressed ,</l>
     <l n="447">Ordained the nuptial day , prepared the feast ;</l>
     <l n="448">And frugally resolved ( the charge to shun , }</l>
     <l n="449">Which would be double should he wed alone ,) }</l>
     <l n="450">To join his brother 's bridal with his own . }</l>
     <l n="451">Lysimachus , oppressed with mortal grief ,</l>
     <l n="452">Received the news , and studied quick relief :</l>
     <l n="453">The fatal day approached ; if force were used ,</l>
     <l n="454">The magistrate his public trust abused ;</l>
     <l n="455">To justice liable , as law required ,</l>
     <l n="456">For when his office ceased , his power expired :</l>
     <l n="457">While power remained , the means were in his hand</l>
     <l n="458">By force to seize , and then forsake the land :</l>
     <l n="459">Betwixt extremes he knew not how to move ,</l>
     <l n="460">A slave to fame , but more a slave to love :</l>
     <l n="461">Restraining others , yet himself not free ,</l>
     <l n="462">Made impotent by power , debased by dignity .</l>
     <l n="463">Both sides he weighed ; but after much debate ,</l>
     <l n="464">The man prevailed above the magistrate .</l>
     <l n="465">Love never fails to master what he finds , }</l>
     <l n="466">But works a different way in different minds , }</l>
     <l n="467">The fool enlightens , and the wise he blinds . }</l>
     <l n="468">This youth , proposing to possess and scape ,</l>
     <l n="469">Began in murder , to conclude in rape :</l>
     <l n="470">Unpraised by me ; though heaven sometime may bless</l>
     <l n="471">An impious act with undeserved success ;</l>
     <l n="472">The great , it seems , are privileged alone</l>
     <l n="473">To punish all injustice but their own .</l>
     <l n="474">But here I stop , not daring to proceed , }</l>
     <l n="475">Yet blush to flatter an unrighteous deed ; }</l>
     <l n="476">For crimes are but permitted , not decreed . }</l>
     <l n="477">Resolved on force , his wit the prætor bent ,</l>
     <l n="478">To find the means that might secure the event ;</l>
     <l n="479">Not long he laboured , for his lucky thought</l>
     <l n="480">In captive Cymon found the friend he sought .</l>
     <l n="481">The example pleased ; the cause and crime the same ;</l>
     <l n="482">An injured lover , and a ravished dame .</l>
     <l n="483">How much he durst he knew by what he dared ; }</l>
     <l n="484">The less he had to lose , the less he cared }</l>
     <l n="485">To manage loathsome life when love was the reward . }</l>
     <l n="486">This pondered well , and fixed on his intent ,</l>
     <l n="487">In depth of night he for the prisoner sent ;</l>
     <l n="488">In secret sent the public view to shun ,</l>
     <l n="489">Then with a sober smile he thus begun :—</l>
     <l n="490">The powers above , who bounteously bestow</l>
     <l n="491">Their gifts and graces on mankind below ,</l>
     <l n="492">Yet prove our merit first , nor blindly give</l>
     <l n="493">To such as are not worthy to receive :</l>
     <l n="494">For valour and for virtue they provide</l>
     <l n="495">Their due reward , but first they must be tried :</l>
     <l n="496">These fruitful seeds within your mind they sowed ;</l>
     <l n="497">‘ Twas yours to improve the talent they bestowed :</l>
     <l n="498">They gave you to be born of noble kind ,</l>
     <l n="499">They gave you love to lighten up your mind ,</l>
     <l n="500">And purge the grosser parts ; they gave you care</l>
     <l n="501">To please , and courage to deserve the fair .</l>
     <l n="502">Thus far they tried you , and by proof they found</l>
     <l n="503">The grain intrusted in a grateful ground :</l>
     <l n="504">But still the great experiment remained ,</l>
     <l n="505">They suffered you to lose the prize you gained ,</l>
     <l n="506">That you might learn the gift was theirs alone ;</l>
     <l n="507">And , when restored , to them the blessing own .</l>
     <l n="508">Restored it soon will be ; the means prepared ,</l>
     <l n="509">The difficulty smoothed , the danger shared :</l>
     <l n="510">Be but yourself , the care to me resign ,</l>
     <l n="511">Then Iphigene is yours , Cassandra mine .</l>
     <l n="512">Your rival Pasimond pursues your life ,</l>
     <l n="513">Impatient to revenge his ravished wife ,</l>
     <l n="514">But yet not his ; to-morrow is behind ,</l>
     <l n="515">And love our fortunes in one band has joined :</l>
     <l n="516">Two brothers are our foes , Ormisda mine ,</l>
     <l n="517">As much declared as Pasimond is thine :</l>
     <l n="518">To-morrow must their common vows be tied : }</l>
     <l n="519">With love to friend , and fortune for our guide , }</l>
     <l n="520">Let both resolve to die , or each redeem a bride . }</l>
     <l n="521">Right I have none , nor hast thou much to plead ;</l>
     <l n="522">‘ Tis force , when done , must justify the deed :</l>
     <l n="523">Our task performed , we next prepare for flight ,</l>
     <l n="524">And let the losers talk in vain of right :</l>
     <l n="525">We with the fair will sail before the wind ;</l>
     <l n="526">If they are grieved , I leave the laws behind .</l>
     <l n="527">Speak thy resolves ; if now thy courage droop ,</l>
     <l n="528">Despair in prison , and abandon hope ;</l>
     <l n="529">But if thou darest in arms thy love regain ,</l>
     <l n="530">( For liberty without thy love were vain ,)</l>
     <l n="531">Then second my design to seize the prey ,</l>
     <l n="532">Or lead to second rape , for well thou know'st the way .</l>
     <l n="533">Said Cymon , overjoyed ,— Do thou propose</l>
     <l n="534">The means to fight , and only shew the foes :</l>
     <l n="535">For from the first , when love had fired my mind ,</l>
     <l n="536">Resolved , I left the care of life behind .—</l>
     <l n="537">To this the bold Lysimachus replied ,—</l>
     <l n="538">Let heaven be neuter , and the sword decide ;</l>
     <l n="539">The spousals are prepared , already play</l>
     <l n="540">The minstrels , and provoke the tardy day :</l>
     <l n="541">By this the brides are waked , their grooms are dressed ; }</l>
     <l n="542">All Rhodes is summoned to the nuptial feast , }</l>
     <l n="543">All but myself , the sole unbidden guest . }</l>
     <l n="544">Unbidden though I am , I will be there ,</l>
     <l n="545">And , joined by thee , intend to joy the fair .</l>
     <l n="546">Now hear the rest ; when day resigns the light ,</l>
     <l n="547">And cheerful torches gild the jolly night ,</l>
     <l n="548">Be ready at my call ; my chosen few</l>
     <l n="549">With arms administered shall aid thy crew .</l>
     <l n="550">Then , entering unexpected , will we seize</l>
     <l n="551">Our destined prey , from men dissolved in ease ,</l>
     <l n="552">By wine disabled , unprepared for fight ;</l>
     <l n="553">And hastening to the seas , suborn our flight :</l>
     <l n="554">The seas are ours , for I command the fort ,</l>
     <l n="555">A ship well manned expects us in the port :</l>
     <l n="556">If they , or if their friends , the prize contest ,</l>
     <l n="557">Death shall attend the man who dares resist .—</l>
     <l n="558">It pleased ; the prisoner to his hold retired , }</l>
     <l n="559">His troop with equal emulation fired , }</l>
     <l n="560">All fixed to fight , and all their wonted work required . }</l>
     <l n="561">The sun arose ; the streets were thronged around ,</l>
     <l n="562">The palace opened , and the posts were crowned .</l>
     <l n="563">The double bridegroom at the door attends</l>
     <l n="564">The expected spouse , and entertains the friends :</l>
     <l n="565">They meet , they lead to church , the priests invoke</l>
     <l n="566">The powers , and feed the flames with fragrant smoke .</l>
     <l n="567">This done , they feast , and at the close of night }</l>
     <l n="568">By kindled torches vary their delight , }</l>
     <l n="569">These lead the lively dance , and those the briming bowls invite . }</l>
     <l n="570">Now , at the appointed place and hour assigned ,</l>
     <l n="571">With souls resolved the ravishers were joined :</l>
     <l n="572">Three bands are formed ; the first is sent before</l>
     <l n="573">To favour the retreat , and guard the shore ;</l>
     <l n="574">The second at the palace-gate is placed ,</l>
     <l n="575">And up the lofty stairs ascend the last :</l>
     <l n="576">A peaceful troop they seem with shining vests ,</l>
     <l n="577">But coats of mail beneath secure their breasts .</l>
     <l n="578">Dauntless they enter , Cymon at their head ,</l>
     <l n="579">And find the feast renewed , the table spread :</l>
     <l n="580">Sweet voices , mixed with instrumental sounds ,</l>
     <l n="581">Ascend the vaulted roof , the vaulted roof rebounds .</l>
     <l n="582">When , like the harpies , rushing through the hall</l>
     <l n="583">The sudden troop appears , the tables fall ,</l>
     <l n="584">Their smoking load is on the pavement thrown ;</l>
     <l n="585">Each ravisher prepares to seize his own :</l>
     <l n="586">The brides , invaded with a rude embrace ,</l>
     <l n="587">Shriek out for aid , confusion fills the place .</l>
     <l n="588">Quick to redeem the prey their plighted lords</l>
     <l n="589">Advance , the palace gleams with shining swords .</l>
     <l n="590">But late is all defence , and succour vain ;</l>
     <l n="591">The rape is made , the ravishers remain :</l>
     <l n="592">Two sturdy slaves were only sent before</l>
     <l n="593">To bear the purchased prize in safety to the shore .</l>
     <l n="594">The troop retires , the lovers close the rear ,</l>
     <l n="595">With forward faces not confessing fear :</l>
     <l n="596">Backward they move , but scorn their pace to mend ;</l>
     <l n="597">Then seek the stairs , and with slow haste descend .</l>
     <l n="598">Fierce Pasimond , their passage to prevent , }</l>
     <l n="599">Thrust full on Cymon 's back in his descent , }</l>
     <l n="600">The blade returned unbathed , and to the handle bent . }</l>
     <l n="601">Stout Cymon soon remounts , and cleft in two</l>
     <l n="602">His rival 's head with one descending blow :</l>
     <l n="603">And as the next in rank Ormisda stood , }</l>
     <l n="604">He turned the point ; the sword , inured to blood , }</l>
     <l n="605">Bored his unguarded breast , which poured a purple flood . }</l>
     <l n="606">With vowed revenge the gathering crowd pursues</l>
     <l n="607">The ravishers turn head , the fight renews ;</l>
     <l n="608">The hall is heaped with corpse ; the sprinkled gore</l>
     <l n="609">Besmears the walls , and floats the marble floor .</l>
     <l n="610">Dispersed at length the drunken squadron flies , }</l>
     <l n="611">The victors to their vessel bear the prize , }</l>
     <l n="612">And hear behind loud groans and lamentable cries . }</l>
     <l n="613">The crew with merry shouts their anchors weigh , }</l>
     <l n="614">Then ply their oars , and brush the buxom sea , }</l>
     <l n="615">While troops of gathered Rhodians crowd the key . }</l>
     <l n="616">What should the people do when left alone ?</l>
     <l n="617">The governor and government are gone ;</l>
     <l n="618">The public wealth to foreign parts conveyed ;</l>
     <l n="619">Some troops disbanded , and the rest unpaid .</l>
     <l n="620">Rhodes is the sovereign of the sea no more ;</l>
     <l n="621">Their ships unrigged , and spent their naval store ,</l>
     <l n="622">They neither could defend , nor can pursue ,</l>
     <l n="623">But grin 'd their teeth , and cast a helpless view :</l>
     <l n="624">In vain with darts a distant war they try ,</l>
     <l n="625">Short , and more short , the missive weapons fly .</l>
     <l n="626">Meanwhile the ravishers their crimes enjoy ,</l>
     <l n="627">And flying sails and sweeping oars employ :</l>
     <l n="628">The cliffs of Rhodes in little space are lost ,</l>
     <l n="629">Jove 's isle they seek , nor Jove denies his coast .</l>
     <l n="630">In safety landed on the Candian shore ,</l>
     <l n="631">With generous wines their spirits they restore ;</l>
     <l n="632">There Cymon with his Rhodian friend resides ,</l>
     <l n="633">Both court , and wed at once the willing brides .</l>
     <l n="634">A war ensues , the Cretans own their cause ,</l>
     <l n="635">Stiff to defend their hospitable laws :</l>
     <l n="636">Both parties lose by turns ; and neither wins ,</l>
     <l n="637">Till peace propounded by a truce begins .</l>
     <l n="638">The kindred of the slain forgive the deed ,</l>
     <l n="639">But a short exile must for show precede :</l>
     <l n="640">The term expired , from Candia they remove ;</l>
     <l n="641">And happy each at home , enjoys his love .</l>

   <p>A great many novels come now fresh into my mind , for the beginning of such an agreeable day 's discourse as this is likely to be ; but one I am more particularly pleased with , because it not only shews the happy conclusion which we are to treat about , but how sacred , how powerful also , as well as advantageous , the force of love is ; which some people , without knowing what they say , unjustly blame and vilify , and which I judge will rather be had in esteem by you , as I suppose you all to be subject to the tender passion .</p>
   <p>According to the ancient histories of Cyprus , there lived sometime in that island , one of great rank and distinction , called Aristippus , by far the wealthiest person in all the country ; and if he was unhappy in any one respect , it was in having , amongst his other children , a son , who , though he exceeded most young people of his time in stature and comeliness , yet was he a perfect natural ; his true name was Galeso , but as neither the labour nor skill of his master , nor the correction of his father , was ever able to beat one letter into his head , or the least instruction of any kind , and as his voice and manner of speaking were strangely harsh and uncouth , he was , by way of disdain , called only Cymon ; which , in their language , signified beast . The father had long beheld him with infinite concern ; and as all hopes were vanished concerning him , to remove out of his sight an object which afforded constant matter of grief , he ordered him away to his country-house , to be there with his slaves . This was extremely agreeable to Cymon , because people of that sort had been always most to his mind . Residing there , and doing all sorts of drudgery pertaining to that kind of life , it happened one day , as he was going , about noontide , with his staff upon his shoulder , from one farm to another , that he passed through a pleasant grove , which , as it was then the month of May , was all in bloom ; from whence , as his stars led him , he came into a meadow surrounded with high trees , in one corner of which was a crystal spring , and by the side of it , upon the grass , lay a most beautiful damsel asleep , clothed with a mantle so exceedingly fine and delicate , as scarcely to conceal underneath the exquisite whiteness of her skin ; only from her waist downwards she wore a white silken quilt , and at her feet were sleeping likewise two women and a man servant . As soon as Cymon cast his eye upon her , as if he had never seen the face of a woman before , he stood leaning upon his staff , and began to gaze with the utmost astonishment , without speaking a word . When suddenly in his rude uncivilized breast , which had hitherto been incapable of receiving the least impression of politeness whatsoever , a sudden thought arose , which seemed to intimate to his gross and shallow understanding , that this was the most agreeable sight that ever was seen . From thence he began to examine each part by itself , commending every limb and feature ; and being now become a judge of beauty from a mere idiot , he grew very desirous of seeing her eyes , on which account he was going several times to wake her ; but as she so far excelled all other women that he ever saw , he was in doubt whether she was a mortal creature . This made him wait to see if she would awake of her own accord ; and though that expectation seemed tedious to him , yet so pleasing was the object , that he had no power to leave it . After a long time she came to herself , and raising up her head , saw Cymon stand propt upon his stick before her , at which she was surprised , and said : “ Cymon , what are you looking for here at this time of day ? ” Now he was known all over the country , as well for his own rusticity , as his father 's nobility and great wealth . He made no answer , but stood with his eyes fixed upon hers , which seemed to dart a sweetness , that filled him with a kind of joy to which he had hitherto been a stranger ; whilst she observing this , and not knowing what his rudeness might prompt him to , called up her women , and then said : “ Cymon , go about your business . ” He replied , “ I will go along with you . ” And though she was afraid , and would have avoided his company , yet he would not leave her till he had brought her to her own house ; from thence he went home to his father , when he declared , that he would return no more into the country , which was very disagreeable to all his friends , but yet they let him alone , waiting to see what this change of temper could be owing to . Love thus having pierced his heart , when no lesson of any kind could ever find admittance , in a little time his way of thinking and behaviour were so far changed , that his father and friends were strangely surprised at it , as well as every body that knew him . First of all then , he asked his father to let him have clothes , and every thing else like his brethren ; to which the father very willingly consented . Conversing too with young gentlemen of character , and observing their ways and manner of behaving , in a very short time he not only got over the first rudiments of learning , but attained to some knowledge in philosophy . Afterwards , his love for Ephigenia being the sole cause of it , his rude and rustic speech was changed into a tone more agreeable and civilized : he grew also a master of music : and with regard to the military art , as well by sea as land , he became as expert and gallant as the best . In short , not to run over all his excellencies , before the expiration of the fourth year from his being first in love , he turned out the most accomplished young gentleman in every respect that ever Cyprus could boast of . What then , most gracious ladies , shall we say of Cymon ? Surely nothing less than this ; that all the noble qualities , which had been infused by heaven into his generous soul , were shut up as it were by invidious fortune , and bound fast with the strongest fetters in a small corner of his heart , till love broke the enchantment , and drove with all its might these virtues out of that cruel obscurity , to which they had been long doomed , to a clear and open day ; plainly shewing from whence it draws those spirits that are its votaries , and whither its mighty influence conducts them . Cymon , therefore , though he might have his flights like other young people , with regard to his love for Ephigenia , yet when Aristippus considered it was that had made a man of him , he not only bore with it , but encouraged him in the pursuit of his pleasures . Cymon , nevertheless , who refused to be called Galeso , remembering that Ephigenia had styled him Cymon , being desirous of bringing that affair to an happy conclusion , had often requested her in marriage of her father , who replied , that he had already promised her to one Pasimunda , a young nobleman of Rhodes , and that he intended not to break his word . The time then being come , that was appointed for their nuptials , and the husband having sent in form to demand her , Cymon said to himself : O , Ephigenia , the time is now come when I shall give proof how I love you ! I am become a man on your account ; and could I but obtain you , I should be as glorious and happy as the gods themselves ; and have you I will , or else I will die . Immediately he prevailed upon some young noblemen who were his friends , to assist him ; and , fitting out a ship of war privately , they put to sea , in order to way-lay the vessel that was to transport Ephigenia ; who , after great respect and honour shewed by her father to her husband 's friends , embarked with them for Rhodes . Cymon , who had but little rest that night , overtook them on the following day , when he called out , “ Stop , and strike your sails ; or expect to go to the bottom of the sea . ” They , on the other hand , had got all their arms above deck , and were preparing for a vigorous defence . He therefore threw a grappling iron upon the other ship , which was making the best of its way , and drew it close to his own ; when , like a lion , without waiting for any one to second him , he jumped singly among his enemies , as if he cared not for them , and , love spurring him on with incredible force , he cut and drove them all like so many sheep before him , till they soon threw down their arms , acknowledging themselves his prisoners ; when he addressed himself to them in the following manner : “ Gentlemen , it is no desire of plunder , nor enmity to any of your company , that made me leave Cyprus to fall upon you here in this manner . What occasioned it is a matter , the success of which is of the utmost consequence to myself , and as easy for you quietly to grant me : it is Ephigenia , whom I love above all the world ; and as I could not have her from her father peaceably , and as a friend , my love constrains me to win her from you as an enemy , by force of arms . Therefore I am resolved to be to her what your Pasimunda was to have been . Resign her then to me , and go away in God 's name . ” The people , more by force than any good will , gave her , all in tears , up to Cymon ; who seeing her lament in that manner , said : “ Fair lady , be not discouraged ; I am your Cymon , who have a better claim to your affection , on account of my long and constant love , than Pasimunda can have by virtue of a promise . ” Taking her then on board his ship , without meddling with any thing else that belonged to them , he suffered them to depart . Cymon thus being the most overjoyed man that could be , after comforting the lady under her calamity , consulted with his friends what to do , who were of opinion that they should by no means return to Cyprus yet ; but that it were better to go directly to Crete , where they had all relations and friends , but Cymon especially , on which account they might be more secure there along with Ephigenia ; and accordingly they directed their course that way . But fortune , who had given the lady to Cymon by an easy conquest , soon changed his immoderate joy into most sad and bitter lamentation . In about four hours from his parting with the Rhodians , night came upon them , which was more welcome to Cymon than any of the rest , and with it a most violent tempest , which overspread the face of the heavens in such a manner , that they could neither see what they did , nor whither they were carried ; nor were they able at all to steer the ship . You may easily suppose what Cymon 's grief must be on this occasion . He concluded , that heaven had crowned his desires only to make death more grievous to him , which before would have been but little regarded . His friends also were greatly affected , but especially Ephigenia , who trembled at every shock , still sharply upbraiding his ill-timed love , and declaring that this tempest was sent by Providence for no other reason , but that as he had resolved to have her , contrary to the will and disposal of heaven , to disappoint that presumption ; and that , seeing her die first , he might die likewise in the same miserable manner . Amongst such complaints as these , they were carried at last , the wind growing continually more violent , near the island of Rhodes ; and not knowing where they were , they endeavoured , for the safety of their lives , to get to land if possible . In this they succeeded , and got into a little bay , where the Rhodian ship had arrived just before them ; nor did they know they were at Rhodes till the next morning , when they saw , about a bow-shot from them , the same ship they had parted with the day before . Cymon was greatly concerned at this ; and fearing what afterwards came to pass , he bid them put to sea if possible , and trust to fortune , for they could never be in a worse place . They used all possible means then to get out , but in vain ; the wind was strongly against them , and drove them to shore in spite of all they could do to prevent it . They were soon known by the sailors of the other ship , who had now gained the shore , and who ran to a neighbouring town , where the young gentlemen that had been on board were just gone before , and informed them how Cymon and Ephigenia were , like themselves , driven thither by stress of weather . They , hearing this , brought a great many people from the town to the sea-side , and took Cymon and his companions prisoners , who had got on shore , with a design of flying to a neighbouring wood , as also Ephigenia , and brought them all together to the town . Pasimunda , upon hearing the news , went and made his complaints to the senate , who accordingly sent Lysimachus , who was chief magistrate that year , along with a guard of soldiers , to conduct them to prison . Thus the miserable and enamoured Cymon lost his mistress soon after he had gained her , and without having scarcely so much as a kiss for his pains . In the mean time Ephigenia was handsomely received by many ladies of quality , and comforted for the trouble she had sustained in being made a captive , as well as in the storm at sea ; and she remained with them till the day appointed for her nuptials . However , Cymon and his friends had their lives granted them ( though Pasimunda used all his endeavours to the contrary ) for the favour shewed to the Rhodians the day before ; but they were sentenced to perpetual imprisonment , where they remained sorrowfully enough , as they had no hopes of obtaining their liberty . Now whilst Pasimunda was making preparation for his nuptials , fortune , as if she had repented the injury done to Cymon , produced a new circumstance for his deliverance . Pasimunda had a brother , beneath him in years , but not in virtue , called Ormisda , who had been long talked of as about to marry a beautiful lady of that city , called Cassandra , whom Lysimachus was also in love with , and had for some time been prevented marrying her , by diverse unlucky accidents . Now as Pasimunda was to celebrate his own nuptials with great state and feasting , he supposed it would save a great deal of expence and trouble , if his brother was to marry at the same time . He consequently proposed the thing again to Cassandra 's friends , and soon brought it to a conclusion ; when it was agreed by all parties , that the same day that Pasimunda brought home Ephigenia , Ormisda should bring home Cassandra . This was very grating to Lysimachus , who saw himself now deprived of the hope which he had hitherto entertained of marrying her himself ; but he was wise enough to conceal it , contriving a way to prevent its taking effect if possible ; none however appeared , but that of taking her away by force . This seemed easy enough on account of his office ; still he thought it not so reputable as if he had borne no office at all at that time ; but in short , after a long debate with himself , honour gave way to love , and he resolved , happen what would , to bear away Cassandra . Thinking then what companions he should make choice of for this enterprise , as well as the means that were to be taken , he soon called Cymon to mind , whom he had in custody , as also his companions ; and thinking he could have nobody better to assist him , nor one more trusty and faithful on that occasion than Cymon , the next night he had him privately into his chamber , where he spoke to him in this manner :— “ Cymon , as the gods are the best and most liberal givers of all things to mankind , so are they also the ablest judges of our several virtues and merits : such then as they find to be firm and constant in every respect , them do they make worthy of the greatest things . Now concerning your worth and valour , they are willing to have a more certain trial of both , than it was possible for you to shew within the scanty limits of your father 's house , whom I know to be a person of the greatest distinction ; for first then , by the pungent force of love , as I am informed , have they , from a mere insensible creature , made a man of you ; and afterwards by adverse fortune , and now by a miserable imprisonment , are they willing to see if your soul be changed from what it was , when you appeared flushed so lately with the prize you had won . If that continues the same , I can propose nothing so agreeable to you , as what I am now going to offer ; which , that you may resume your former might and valour , I shall immediately disclose . Pasimunda , overjoyed with your disappointment , and a zealous promoter , as far as in him lay , of your being put to death , is now about to celebrate his marriage with your Ephigenia , that he may enjoy that blessing , which fortune , when she was favourable , first put into your power , and afterwards snatched away from you ; but how this must afflict you , I can easily suppose by myself , who am like to undergo the same injury , and at the same time , with regard to my mistress Cassandra , who is to be married then to his brother Ormisda . Now I see no remedy for either of us , but what consists in our own resolution , and the strength of our arms : it will be necessary , therefore , to make our way with our swords , for each of us to gain his lady : if then you value ( I will not say your liberty , because that without her would be of little weight with you ; but , I say , if you value ) your mistress , you need only follow me , and fortune has put her into your hands . ” These words spoke comfort to the drooping soul of Cymon , who immediately replied , “ Lysimachus , you could never have a more stout , nor a more trusty friend for such an enterprize than myself , if it be as you seem to promise : tell me then what you would have me do , and you shall see me put it nobly into execution . ” Lysimachus made answer , “ Three days hence the ladies are to be brought home to their espoused husbands , when you , with your friends and myself , with some people whom I can confide in , will go armed in the evening , and enter their house whilst they are in the midst of their mirth , where we will seize on the two brides , and carry them away to a ship which I have secretly provided , killing all that shall presume to oppose us . ” This scheme was entirely to Cymon 's good liking , and he waited quietly till the time appointed . The wedding-day being now come , and every part of their house full of mirth and feasting , Lysimachus , after giving the necessary orders at the time fixed , divided Cymon and his companions with his own friends into three parties , and putting arms under their several cloaks , and animating them boldly to pursue what they had undertaken , he sent one party to the haven to secure their escape , and with the other two they went to Pasimunda 's house ; one they stationed at the gate , to prevent any persons shutting them up in the house ; whilst he , along with Cymon , went up stairs with the remaining part .— Coming then into the dining-room , where the two brides , with many other ladies , were seated orderly at supper , they advanced up to them , and throwing down all the tables , each seized his lady , and giving them into the arms of their followers , ordered them to carry them away to their ship . The brides , as well as the other ladies and the servants , cried out so much , that immediately there was a great tumult . In the mean time , Cymon and Lysimachus , with their followers , all drew their swords , and came down stairs again without any opposition , till they met with Pasimunda , having in his hand a great club , whom the noise had drawn thither , when Cymon , at one stroke , laid him dead at his feet , and whilst Ormisda was running to his assistance , he was likewise killed by Cymon ; many others also of their friends , who came to their relief , were wounded and beaten back . Leaving the house then all full of blood and confusion , they joined parties , and went directly on to their ship with their booty , without the least hindrance whatever ; when putting the ladies on board , and they with all their friends following them , the shore was soon filled with crowds of people , who came to rescue them , upon which they plied their oars , and sailed joyfully away for Crete . There they were cheerfully received by all their friends and relations , when they espoused their ladies , and were well pleased with their several prizes . This occasioned great quarrels afterwards between the two islands of Cyprus and Rhodes . At length , by the interposition of friends , every thing was amicably adjusted , and then Cymon returned along with Ephigenia to Cyprus , and Lysimachus in like manner carried Cassandra back to Rhodes , where they lived very happily to the end of their days .</p>
