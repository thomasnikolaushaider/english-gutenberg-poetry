    <head>THE AMOROUS COURTESAN</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">DAN CUPID , though the god of soft amour ,</l>
     <l n="2">In ev'ry age works miracles a store ;</l>
     <l n="3">Can Catos change to male coquets at ease ;</l>
     <l n="4">And fools make oracles whene'er he please ;</l>
     <l n="5">Turn wolves to sheep , and ev'ry thing so well ,</l>
     <l n="6">That naught remains the former shape to tell :</l>
     <l n="7">Remember , Hercules , with wond'rous pow'r ,</l>
     <l n="8">And Polyphemus , who would men devour :</l>
     <l n="9">The one upon a rock himself would fling ,</l>
     <l n="10">And to the winds his am'rous ditties sing ;</l>
     <l n="11">To cut his beard a nymph could him inspire ;</l>
     <l n="12">And , in the water , he 'd his face admire .</l>
     <l n="13">His club the other to a spindle changed ,</l>
     <l n="14">To please the belle with whom he often ranged .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="15">A hundred instances the fact attest ,</l>
     <l n="16">But sage Boccace has one , it is confessed ,</l>
     <l n="17">Which seems to me , howe'er we search around ,</l>
     <l n="18">To be a sample , rarely to be found .</l>
     <l n="19">‘ Tis Chimon that I mean , a savage youth ,</l>
     <l n="20">Well formed in person , but the rest uncouth ,</l>
     <l n="21">A bear in mind , but Cupid much can do ,</l>
     <l n="22">LOVE licked the cub , and decent soon he grew .</l>
     <l n="23">A fine gallant at length the lad appeared ;</l>
     <l n="24">From whence the change ?— Fine eyes his bosom cheered</l>
     <l n="25">The piercing rays no sooner reached his sight ,</l>
     <l n="26">But all the savage took at once to flight ;</l>
     <l n="27">He felt the tender flame ; polite became ;</l>
     <l n="28">You 'll find howe'er , our tale is not the same .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="29">I MEAN to state how once an easy fair ,</l>
     <l n="30">Who oft amused the youth devoid of care ,</l>
     <l n="31">A tender flame within her heart retained ,</l>
     <l n="32">Though haughty , singular , and unrestrained .</l>
     <l n="33">Not easy ‘ twas her favours to procure ;</l>
     <l n="34">Rome was the place where dwelled this belle impure ;</l>
     <l n="35">The mitre and the cross with her were naught ;</l>
     <l n="36">Though at her feet , she 'd give them not a thought ;</l>
     <l n="37">And those who were not of the highest class ,</l>
     <l n="38">No moments were allowed with her to pass .</l>
     <l n="39">A member of the conclave , first in rank ,</l>
     <l n="40">To be her slave , she 'd scarcely deign to thank ;</l>
     <l n="41">Unless a cardinal 's gay nephew came ,</l>
     <l n="42">And then , perhaps , she 'd listen to his flame ;</l>
     <l n="43">The pope himself , had he perceived her charms ,</l>
     <l n="44">Would not have been too good to grace her arms .</l>
     <l n="45">Her pride appeared in clothes as well as air ,</l>
     <l n="46">And on her sparkled gold and jewels rare ;</l>
     <l n="47">In all the elegance of dress arrayed ,</l>
     <l n="48">Embroidery and lace , her taste displayed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="49">THE god of soft amour beheld her aim ;</l>
     <l n="50">And sought at once her haughty soul to tame ;</l>
     <l n="51">A Roman gentleman , of finest form ,</l>
     <l n="52">Soon in her bosom raised a furious storm ;</l>
     <l n="53">Camillus was the name this youth had got ;</l>
     <l n="54">The nymph 's was Constance , that LOVE 'S arrow shot :</l>
     <l n="55">Though he was mild , good humoured , and serene ,</l>
     <l n="56">No sooner Constance had his person seen ,</l>
     <l n="57">And in her breast received the urchin 's dart ,</l>
     <l n="58">Than throbs , and trembling fears o'erwhelmed her heart .</l>
     <l n="59">The flame she durst declare no other way ,</l>
     <l n="60">Than by those sighs , which feelings oft betray .</l>
     <l n="61">Till then , nor shame nor aught could her retain ;</l>
     <l n="62">Now all was changed :— her bashfulness was plain .</l>
     <l n="63">As none , howe'er , could think the subtle flame</l>
     <l n="64">Would lie concealed with such a haughty dame ,</l>
     <l n="65">Camillus nothing of the kind supposed .</l>
     <l n="66">Though she incessantly by looks disclosed ,</l>
     <l n="67">That something unrevealed disturbed the soul ,</l>
     <l n="68">And o'er her mind had absolute control .</l>
     <l n="69">Whatever presents Constance might receive ,</l>
     <l n="70">Still pensive sighs her breast appeared to heave :</l>
     <l n="71">Her tints of beauty too , began to fail ,</l>
     <l n="72">And o'er the rose , the lily to prevail .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="73">ONE night Camillus had a party met ,</l>
     <l n="74">Of youthful beaux and belles , a charming set ,</l>
     <l n="75">And , ‘ mong the rest , fair Constance was a guest ;</l>
     <l n="76">The evening passed in jollity and jest ;</l>
     <l n="77">For few to holy converse seemed inclined ,</l>
     <l n="78">And none for Methodists appeared designed :</l>
     <l n="79">Not one , but Constance , deaf to wit was found ,</l>
     <l n="80">And , on her , raillery went briskly round .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="81">THE supper o'er the company withdrew ,</l>
     <l n="82">But Constance suddenly was lost to view ;</l>
     <l n="83">Beside a certain bed she took her seat ,</l>
     <l n="84">Where no one ever dreamed she would retreat ,</l>
     <l n="85">And all supposed , that ill , or spirits weak ,</l>
     <l n="86">She home had run , or something wished to seek .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="87">THE company retired , Camillus said ,</l>
     <l n="88">He meant to write before he went to bed ,</l>
     <l n="89">And told his valet he might go to rest</l>
     <l n="90">A lucky circumstance , it is confessed .</l>
     <l n="91">Thus left alone , and as the belle desired ;</l>
     <l n="92">Who , from her soul , the spark so much admired ;</l>
     <l n="93">Yet knew not how the subject to disclose ,</l>
     <l n="94">Or , in what way her wishes to propose ;</l>
     <l n="95">At length , with trembling accents , she revealed ;</l>
     <l n="96">The flame she longer could not keep concealed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="97">EXCEEDINGLY surprised Camillus seemed ,</l>
     <l n="98">And scarcely could believe but what he dreamed ;</l>
     <l n="99">Why , hey ! said he , good lady , is it thus ,</l>
     <l n="100">With favoured friends , you doubtful points discuss ?</l>
     <l n="101">He made her sit , and then his seat regained</l>
     <l n="102">Who would have thought , cried he , you here remained ;</l>
     <l n="103">Now who this hiding place to you could tell ?</l>
     <l n="104">‘ Twas LOVE , fond LOVE ! replied the beauteous belle ;</l>
     <l n="105">And straight a blush her lovely cheek suffused ,</l>
     <l n="106">So rare with those to Cyprian revels used ;</l>
     <l n="107">For Venus 's vot'ries , to pranks resigned ,</l>
     <l n="108">Another way , to get a colour , find .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="109">CAMILLUS , truly , some suspicions had ,</l>
     <l n="110">That he was loved , though neither fool nor mad ;</l>
     <l n="111">Nor such a novice in the Paphian scene ,</l>
     <l n="112">But what he could at once some notions glean :</l>
     <l n="113">More certain tokens , howsoe'er , to get ,</l>
     <l n="114">And set the lady 's feelings on the fret ,</l>
     <l n="115">By trying if the gloom that o'er her reigned</l>
     <l n="116">Was only sly pretence , he coldness feigned .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="117">SHE often sighed as if her heart would break ;</l>
     <l n="118">At length love 's piercing anguish made her speak :</l>
     <l n="119">What you will say , cried she , I cannot guess ,</l>
     <l n="120">To see me thus a fervent flame confess .</l>
     <l n="121">The very thought my face with crimson dyes ;</l>
     <l n="122">My way of life no shield for this supplies ;</l>
     <l n="123">The moment pure affection ‘ s in the soul ,</l>
     <l n="124">No longer wanton freaks the mind control .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="125">MY conduct to excuse , what can I say ?</l>
     <l n="126">O could my former life be done away ,</l>
     <l n="127">And in your recollection naught remain ,</l>
     <l n="128">But what might virtuous constancy maintain</l>
     <l n="129">At all event , my frankness overlook ,</l>
     <l n="130">Too well I see , the fatal path I took</l>
     <l n="131">Has such displeasure to your breast conveyed ,</l>
     <l n="132">My zeal will rather hurt than give me aid ;</l>
     <l n="133">But hurt or not , I 'll idolize you still :</l>
     <l n="134">Beat , drive away , contemn me as you will ;</l>
     <l n="135">Or worse , if you the torment can contrive</l>
     <l n="136">I 'm your 's alone , Camillus , while alive .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="137">TO this harangue the wary youth replied</l>
     <l n="138">In truth , fair lady , I could ne'er decide ,</l>
     <l n="139">To criticise what others round may do. - </l>
     <l n="140">‘ Tis not the line I 'd willingly pursue ;</l>
     <l n="141">And I will freely say , that your discourse</l>
     <l n="142">Has much surprised me , though ‘ tis void of force .</l>
     <l n="143">To you it surely never can belong ,</l>
     <l n="144">To say variety in love is wrong ;</l>
     <l n="145">Besides , your sex , and decency , ‘ tis clear ,</l>
     <l n="146">To ev'ry disadvantage you appear .</l>
     <l n="147">What use this eloquence , and what your aim ?</l>
     <l n="148">Such charms alone as your 's could me inflame ;</l>
     <l n="149">Their pow'r is great , but fully I declare ,</l>
     <l n="150">I do not like advances from the FAIR .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="151">To Constance this a thunder-clap appeared ;</l>
     <l n="152">Howe'er , she in her purpose persevered .</l>
     <l n="153">Said she , this treatment doubtless I deserve ;</l>
     <l n="154">But still , from truth my tongue can never swerve ,</l>
     <l n="155">And if I may presume my thoughts to speak ,</l>
     <l n="156">The plan which I 've pursued your love to seek ,</l>
     <l n="157">Had never proved injurious to my cause ,</l>
     <l n="158">If still my beauty merited applause .</l>
     <l n="159">From what you 've said , and what your looks express</l>
     <l n="160">To please your sight , no charms I now possess .</l>
     <l n="161">Whence comes this change ?— to you i will refer ;</l>
     <l n="162">Till now I was admired , you must aver ;</l>
     <l n="163">And ev'ry one my person highly praised ;</l>
     <l n="164">These precious gifts , that admiration raised ,</l>
     <l n="165">Alas ! are fled , and since I felt LOVE 'S flame ,</l>
     <l n="166">Experience whispers , I 'm no more the same ;</l>
     <l n="167">No longer have charms that please your eyes :</l>
     <l n="168">How happy I should feel if they 'd suffice !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="169">THE suppliant belle now hoped to be allowed</l>
     <l n="170">One half his bed to whom her sighs were vowed ;</l>
     <l n="171">But terror closed her lips ; she nothing said ,</l>
     <l n="172">Though oft her eyes were to his pillow led .</l>
     <l n="173">To be confused the wily stripling feigned ,</l>
     <l n="174">And like a statue for a time remained .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="175">AT length he said :— I know not what to do ;</l>
     <l n="176">Undressing , by myself , I can n't pursue .</l>
     <l n="177">Shall I your valet call ? rejoined the fair ;</l>
     <l n="178">On no account , said he , with looks of care ;</l>
     <l n="179">I would not have you in my chamber seen ,</l>
     <l n="180">Nor thought that here , by night , a girl had been ,</l>
     <l n="181">Your caution is enough , the belle replied :</l>
     <l n="182">Myself between the wall and bed I 'll hide ,</l>
     <l n="183">‘ Twill what you fear prevent , and ills avoid ;</l>
     <l n="184">But bolt the door : you 'll then be not annoyed ;</l>
     <l n="185">Let no one come ; for once I 'll do my best ,</l>
     <l n="186">And as your valet act till you 're undressed ;</l>
     <l n="187">To am'rous Constance this permission grant</l>
     <l n="188">The honour would her throbbing breast enchant .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="189">THE youth to her proposal gave consent ,</l>
     <l n="190">And Constance instantly to business went ;</l>
     <l n="191">The means she used to take his clothes were such ,</l>
     <l n="192">That scarcely once his person felt her touch ;</l>
     <l n="193">She stopt not there , but even freely chose</l>
     <l n="194">To take from off his feet , both shoes and hose</l>
     <l n="195">What , say you :— With her hands did Constance this ?</l>
     <l n="196">Pray tell me what you see therein amiss ?</l>
     <l n="197">I wish sincerely I could do the same ,</l>
     <l n="198">With one for whom I feel a tender flame .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="199">BETWEEN the clothes in haste Camillus flew ,</l>
     <l n="200">Without inviting Constance to pursue .</l>
     <l n="201">She thought at first he meant to try her love ;</l>
     <l n="202">But raillery , this conduct was above .</l>
     <l n="203">His aim , howe'er more fully to unfold ,</l>
     <l n="204">She presently observed :— ‘ Tis very cold ;</l>
     <l n="205">Where shall I sleep ? said she :</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>CAMILLUS</head>
     <l n="1">Just where you please ;</l>

     <l n="1">What , on this chair ?</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>CAMILLUS</head>
     <l n="1">No , no , be more at ease ;</l>
     <l n="2">Come into bed .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>CONSTANCE</head>
     <l n="1">Unlace me then , I pray .</l>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>CAMILLUS</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I cannot : I 'm undressed , and cold as clay :</l>
     <l n="2">Unlace yourself .—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">Just then the belle perceived</l>
     <l n="4">A poinard , which anxiety relieved ;</l>
     <l n="5">She drew it from the scabbard , cut her lace ,</l>
     <l n="6">And many parts of dress designed for grace ,</l>
     <l n="7">The works of months , embroidery and flow'r</l>
     <l n="8">Now perished in the sixtieth of an hour ,</l>
     <l n="9">Without regret , or seeming to lament ,</l>
     <l n="10">What more than life will of the sex content .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">YE dames of Britain , Germany , or France ,</l>
     <l n="12">Would you have done as much , through complaisance ?</l>
     <l n="13">You would not , I 'm convinced : the thing is clear ;</l>
     <l n="14">But doubtless this , at Rome , must fine appear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="15">POOR Constance softly to the bed approached ,</l>
     <l n="16">No longer now supposing she encroached ,</l>
     <l n="17">And trusting that , no stratagem again</l>
     <l n="18">Would be contrived to give her bosom pain .</l>
     <l n="19">Camillus said : my sentiments I 'll speak ;</l>
     <l n="20">Dissimulation I will never seek ;</l>
     <l n="21">She who can proffer what should be denied ,</l>
     <l n="22">Shall never be admitted by my side ;</l>
     <l n="23">But if the place your approbation meet ,</l>
     <l n="24">I wo n't refuse your lying at my feet .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">FAIR Constance such reproof could not withstand ,</l>
     <l n="26">‘ Twas well the poinard was not in her hand ;</l>
     <l n="27">Her bosom so severely felt the smart ,</l>
     <l n="28">She would have plunged the dagger through her heart :</l>
     <l n="29">But Hope , sweet Hope ! still fluttered to her view ;</l>
     <l n="30">And young Camillus pretty well she knew ;</l>
     <l n="31">Howe'er with such severity he spoke ,</l>

     <l n="39">We may conjecture if he were at ease ;</l>

     <l n="41">A beauty so renowned for charms and pride ,</l>
     <l n="42">‘ Twould take a week , to note each trait described ;</l>

     <l n="45">CAMILLUS stretched his legs , and on her breast</l>
     <l n="46">Familiarly allowed his feet to rest ;</l>
     <l n="47">A cushion made of what so fair appeared ,</l>
     <l n="48">That envy might from ivory be feared ;</l>
     <l n="49">Then seemed as if to Morpheus he inclined ,</l>
     <l n="50">And on the pillow sullenly resigned .</l>
     <l n="51">At last the sighs with which her bosom heaved ,</l>
     <l n="52">Gave vent to floods of tears that much relieved ;</l>
     <l n="53">This was the end :— Camillus silence broke ,</l>

     <l n="61">No , no , sweet fair , you know me not ‘ tis plain :</l>

     <l n="63">Your heart I 've probed , ‘ tis all that I desire ;</l>

     <l n="65">Your rigour now in turn you may display ;</l>
     <l n="66">It is but fair : be bountiful I pray ;</l>
     <l n="67">Myself from hence your lover I declare ;</l>

     <l n="71">Your husband I 'll become ; forget the past ;</l>
     <l n="72">Unpleasant recollections should not last .</l>
     <l n="73">Yet there 's one thing which much I wish to speak</l>
     <l n="74">The marriage must be secret that we seek ;</l>

     <l n="76">What I have said I trust will you dispose ,</l>
     <l n="77">To act as I desire : you 'll find it best :—</l>

     <l n="1">TO serve the shop as ‘ prentice was the lot ;</l>
     <l n="2">Of one who had the name of Nicaise got ;</l>
     <l n="3">A lad quite ignorant beyond his trade ,</l>
     <l n="4">And what arithmetick might lend him aid ;</l>
     <l n="5">A perfect novice in the wily art ,</l>
     <l n="6">That in amours is used to win the heart .</l>
     <l n="7">Good tradesmen formerly were late to learn</l>
     <l n="8">The tricks that soon in friars we discern ;</l>
     <l n="9">They ne'er were known those lessons to begin ,</l>
     <l n="10">Till more than down appeared upon the chin .</l>
     <l n="11">But now-a-days , in practice , ‘ tis confessed ,</l>
     <l n="12">These shopkeepers are knowing as the best .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">OUR lad of ancient date was less advanced ;</l>
     <l n="14">At scenes of love his eyes had never glanced ;</l>
     <l n="15">Be that as ‘ twill , he now was in the way ,</l>
     <l n="16">And naught but want of wit produced delay :</l>
     <l n="17">A belle indeed had on him set her heart</l>
     <l n="18">His master 's daughter felt LOVE 'S poignant smart ;</l>
     <l n="19">A girl of most engaging mind and mien ,</l>
     <l n="20">And always steady in her conduct seen .</l>
     <l n="21">Sincerity of soul or humour free ,</l>
     <l n="22">Or whether with her taste it might agree ,</l>
     <l n="23">A fool ‘ twas clear presided o'er her soul ,</l>
     <l n="24">And all her thoughts and actions felt control .</l>
     <l n="25">Some bold gallant would p'erhaps inform her plain ,</l>
     <l n="26">She ever kept wild Folly in her train ,</l>
     <l n="27">And nothing say to me who tales relate ;</l>
     <l n="28">But oft on reason such proceedings wait .</l>
     <l n="29">If you a goddess love , advance she 'll make ;</l>
     <l n="30">Our belle the same advantages would take .</l>
     <l n="31">Her fortune , wit , and charm , attention drew ,</l>
     <l n="32">And many sparks would anxiously pursue ;</l>
     <l n="33">How happy he who should her heart obtain ,</l>
     <l n="34">And Hymen prove he had not sighed in vain !</l>
     <l n="35">But she had promised , to the modest youth ,</l>
     <l n="36">Who first was named , her confidence and truth ;</l>
     <l n="37">The little god of pleasing soft desire</l>
     <l n="38">With full compliance with his whims require .</l>

     <l n="39">THe belle was pleased the ‘ prentice to prefer :</l>
     <l n="40">A handsome lad with truth we may aver ,</l>
     <l n="41">Quite young , well made , with fascinating eye :</l>
     <l n="42">Such charms are ne'er despised we may rely ,</l>
     <l n="43">But treasures thought , no FAIR will e'er neglect ;</l>
     <l n="44">Whate'er her senses say , she 'll these respect .</l>
     <l n="45">For one that LOVE lays hold of by the soul ,</l>
     <l n="46">A thousand by the eyes receive control .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="47">THIS sprightly girl with soft endearing ease ,</l>
     <l n="48">Exerted ev'ry care the lad to please ,</l>
     <l n="49">To his regards she never shy appeared ;</l>
     <l n="50">Now pinched his arm , then smiled and often leered ;</l>
     <l n="51">Her hand across his eyes would sometimes put ;</l>
     <l n="52">At others try to step upon his foot .</l>
     <l n="53">To this he nothing offered in reply ,</l>
     <l n="54">Though oft his throbbing bosom heaved a sigh .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="55">So many tender scenes , at length we find ,</l>
     <l n="56">Produced the explanation LOVE designed ;</l>
     <l n="57">The youthful couple , we may well believe ,</l>
     <l n="58">Would from each other mutual vows receive ;</l>
     <l n="59">They neither promises nor kisses spared ,</l>
     <l n="60">Incalculable were the numbers shared ;</l>
     <l n="61">If he had tried to keep exact account ,</l>
     <l n="62">He soon had been bewildered with th ’ amount ;</l>
     <l n="63">To such infinity it clearly ran ,</l>
     <l n="64">Mistakes would rise if he pursued the plan ;</l>
     <l n="65">A ceremony solely was required ,</l>
     <l n="66">Which prudent girls have always much admired ,</l>
     <l n="67">Yet this to wait gave pain and made her grieve ;</l>
     <l n="68">From you , said she , the boon I would receive ;</l>
     <l n="69">Or while I live the rapture never know ,</l>
     <l n="70">That Hymen at his altar can bestow ;</l>
     <l n="71">To you I promise , by the pow'rs divine ,</l>
     <l n="72">My hand and heart I truly will resign .</l>
     <l n="73">Howe'er I 'll freely say , should Hymen fail</l>
     <l n="74">To make me your 's and wishes not prevail ,</l>
     <l n="75">You must not fancy I 'll become a nun ,</l>
     <l n="76">Though much I hope to act as I 've begun ;</l>
     <l n="77">To marry you would please me to the soul ;</l>
     <l n="78">But how can WE the ruling pow'rs control ?</l>
     <l n="79">Too much I 'm confident you love my fame ,</l>
     <l n="80">To aim at what might bring me soon to shame :</l>
     <l n="81">In wedlock I 've been asked by that and this ;</l>
     <l n="82">My father thinks these offers not amiss ;</l>
     <l n="83">But , Nicaise , I 'll allow you still to hope ,</l>
     <l n="84">That if with others I 'm obliged to cope ,</l>
     <l n="85">No matter whether counsellor or judge .</l>
     <l n="86">Since clearly ev'ry thing to such I grudge ,</l>
     <l n="87">The marriage eve , or morn , or day , or hour ,</l>
     <l n="88">To you I 'll give — the first enchanting flow'r .</l>

     <l n="89">THE lad most gratefully his thanks returned ;</l>
     <l n="90">His breast with ev'ry soft emotion burned .</l>
     <l n="91">Within a week , to this sweet charmer came ,</l>
     <l n="92">A rich young squire , who soon declared his flame ;</l>
     <l n="93">On which she said to Nicaise :— he will do ;</l>
     <l n="94">This spark will easily let matters through ;</l>
     <l n="95">And as the belle was confident of that ,</l>
     <l n="96">She gave consent and listened to his chat .</l>
     <l n="97">Soon all was settled and arranged the day ,</l>
     <l n="98">When marriage they no longer would delay ,</l>
     <l n="99">You 'll fully notice this :— I think I view</l>
     <l n="100">The thoughts which move around and you pursue ;</l>
     <l n="101">‘ Twas doubtless clear , whatever bliss in store ,</l>
     <l n="102">The lady was betrothed , and nothing more .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="103">THOUGH all was fixed a week before the day ,</l>
     <l n="104">Yet fearing accidents might things delay ,</l>
     <l n="105">Or even break the treaty ere complete ,</l>
     <l n="106">She would not our apprentice fully greet ,</l>
     <l n="107">Till on the very morn she gave her hand ,</l>
     <l n="108">Lest chance defeated what was nicely planned .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="109">HOWE'ER the belle was to the altar led ,</l>
     <l n="110">A virgin still , and doomed the squire to wed ,</l>
     <l n="111">Who , quite impatient , consummation sought ,</l>
     <l n="112">As soon as he the charmer back had brought ;</l>
     <l n="113">But she solicited the day apart ,</l>
     <l n="114">And this obtained , alone by prayers and art .</l>
     <l n="115">‘ Twas early morn , and ‘ stead of bed she dressed ,</l>
     <l n="116">In ev'ry thing a queen had thought the best ;</l>
     <l n="117">With diamonds , pearls , and various jewels rare ;</l>
     <l n="118">Her husband riches had , she was aware ,</l>
     <l n="119">Which raised her into rank that dress required ,</l>
     <l n="120">And all her neighbours envied and admired .</l>
     <l n="121">Her lover , to secure the promised bliss ,</l>
     <l n="122">An hour 's indulgence gained to take a kiss .</l>
     <l n="123">A bow'r within a garden was the spot ,</l>
     <l n="124">Which , for their private meeting , they had got .</l>
     <l n="125">A confidant had been employed around ,</l>
     <l n="126">To watch if any one were lurking found .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="127">THE lady was the first who thither came ;</l>
     <l n="128">To get a nosegay was , she said , her aim ;</l>
     <l n="129">And Nicaise presently her steps pursued ,</l>
     <l n="130">Who , when the turf within the bow'r he viewed ,</l>
     <l n="131">Exclaimed , oh la ! how wet it is my dear !</l>
     <l n="132">Your handsome clothes will be spoiled I fear !</l>
     <l n="133">A carpet let me instantly provide ?</l>
     <l n="134">Deuce take the clothes ! the fair with anger cried ;</l>
     <l n="135">Ne'er think of that : I 'll say I had a fall ;</l>
     <l n="136">Such accident a loss I would not call ,</l>
     <l n="137">When Time so clearly on the wing appears ,</l>
     <l n="138">‘ Tis right to banish scruples , cares , and fears ;</l>
     <l n="139">Nor think of clothes nor dress , however fine ,</l>
     <l n="140">But those to dirt or flames at once resign ;</l>
     <l n="141">Far better this than precious time to waste ,</l>
     <l n="142">Since frequently in minutes bliss we taste ;</l>
     <l n="143">A quarter of an hour we now should prize ,</l>
     <l n="144">The place no doubt will very well suffice ;</l>
     <l n="145">With you it rests such moments to employ ,</l>
     <l n="146">And mutually our bosoms fill with joy .</l>
     <l n="147">I scarcely ought to say what now I speak ,</l>

     <l n="152">Two minutes will suffice I 'm very clear .</l>
     <l n="153">AWAY the silly lad with ardour flew ,</l>
     <l n="154">And left no time objections to renew .</l>
     <l n="155">His wondrous folly cured the charming dame ;</l>
     <l n="156">Whose soul so much disdained her recent flame ;</l>
     <l n="157">That instantly her heart resumed its place ,</l>
     <l n="158">Which had too long been loaded with disgrace :</l>
     <l n="159">Go , prince of fools , she to herself exclaimed ,</l>
     <l n="160">For ever , of thy conduct , be ashamed ;</l>

     <l n="162">Impossible a worse I could have met .</l>
     <l n="163">I 've now considered , and ‘ tis very plain ,</l>
     <l n="164">Thou merit'st not such favours to obtain ;</l>
