    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">Though they are never particularly edifying , literary quarrels may at times be educative . Always savage , attacks on Pope reached their lowest depths of scurrility in 1742 , when , in addition to the usual prose and doggerel verse pamphlets , engravings were being circulated portraying Pope in a brothel — this on the basis of the story told in the notorious Letter from Mr. Cibber to Mr. Pope , dated 7 July 1742 .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>The Augustan Reprint Society has already reissued three of the anonymous Grub Street attacks made upon Pope in this busy year ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>but the present volume is intended to complete the picture of the battle-lines by reprinting a verse attack launched from the court — by Hervey presenting himself as Cibber 's ally — and a verse defence that comes , in point of artistry , clearly from or near Grub Street itself .</p>
    <p n="2">Lord Hervey 's verses , The Difference between Verbal and Practical Virtue , were published between 21 and 24 August 1742 , less than a week after the same author 's prose pamphlet ( A Letter to Mr. C — b — r , On his Letter to Mr . P ——. ) which had compared the art of Pope and Cibber to Cibber 's advantage , and had roundly concluded that Pope was “ a second-rate Poet , a bad Companion , a dangerous Acquaintance , an inveterate , implacable Enemy , nobody 's Friend , a noxious Member of Society , and a thorough bad Man . ” In the course of the prose pamphlet Hervey had suggested that there was a certain incongruity between Pope 's true character and his assumed persona of the “ virtuous man , ” and this incongruity forms the main subject of his verse attack . Here Hervey finds examples of “ the difference between verbal and practical virtue ” in the lives of Horace , Seneca , and Sallust , before turning to lampoon Pope crossly and ineptly . The attack on Horace is well conceived for Hervey 's purpose and calculated to damage Pope who was in so many eyes , including his own , the modern heir of that ancient poet , but the straight abuse directed against Pope 's person is sad stuff . Such lines as those on the “ yelping Mungril ” ( p. 6 ) serve only to show how squarely the “ well-bred Spaniels ” taunt in the Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot had hit its target . Hervey 's poem carried a prefatory letter headed “ Mr. C — b — er to Mr. P ., ” making out that Cibber had a hand in writing the poem itself . Coming so soon after Hervey 's Letter to Cibber , which had carried the markedly intimate subscription “ With the greatest Gratitude and Truth , most affectionately yours , ” this prefatory letter to the poem further emphasized Hervey 's firm and deliberate alliance with Cibber .</p>
    <p n="3">Evidently it was the strangeness of this alliance between the two opponents of Pope that struck the fancy of that unidentified “ Scriblerus ” whose “ Epistle to the Dunces , ” The Scribleriad , was published between 30 September and 2 October 1742 . When Hervey was “ affectionately yours ” to Cibber , the two stood shoulder to shoulder so temptingly open to a single volley that the author of The Scribleriad could fairly claim , as Pope had claimed in the appendix to The Dunciad Variorum of 1729 , that “ the Poem was not made for these Authors , but these Authors for the Poem . ” Hervey appears as “ Narcissus , ” the nickname Pope had used for him in The New Dunciad . A “ late Vice-Chamberlain ” ( because he had been dismissed from that post in July 1742 ) still gorged with the fulsome dedication of Conyers Middleton 's Life of Cicero ( 1741 ) , he is shown ( pp . 11-13 ) rousing Cibber . Cibber 's situation , reclining on the lap of Dulness where he is found by Hervey , is taken from The New Dunciad , while his general Satanic role parallels Theobald 's in The Dunciad Variorum . This may reflect common knowledge that Pope was at work on revisions that would raise Cibber to the Dunces ’ throne , but the belief that Cibber was King of the Dunces had been widespread from the date of his appointment as Poet Laureate .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>The Scribleriad follows the general run of satires against Cibber — attacking his senile infatuation for Peg Woffington , his violently demagogic and chauvinistic Nonjuror ( first acted in 1717 but still drawing an audience in 1741 ) , his laureate odes and his frank commercialization of art .</p>
    <p n="4">Although the writer of The Scribleriad was obviously prompted by the example of The Dunciad and borrows many details from Pope , his poem has very little of that mock-epic quality its title might lead a reader to expect . There are slight traces of parody of Virgil when , on page 16 , Cibber appears as Aeneas ( the character he was soon to assume in The Dunciad in Four Books ) and the epicene Hervey is portrayed as a rejuvenated Sybil guiding the hero through a hell of duncery . There are hints of Paradise Lost too , when Cibber , Satan-like , undertakes his mission ( p. 17 ) and the dunces , Belial-like , agree “ they 're better in a cursed State ,/ Than to be totally annihilate ” ( p. 5 ) . But “ Scriblerus ’ ” use of Virgil and Milton , unlike Pope 's , does not import some graver meaning into his poem ; it provides him with neither a framework of moral symbols nor a continuous narrative thread .</p>
    <p n="5">The action is slight and its setting vague . Sometimes we are in a brothel , crowded with bullies , punks , lords , draymen and linkboys , and managed by Cibber ( pp . 11-12 ) or by Dulness ( p. 10 ) . This setting , together with the claim that Cibber 's own muse is a prostitute ( p. 8 ) , serves as a retort to the Tom-Tit in the brothel story in Cibber 's Letter to Pope and to emphasize the element of literary prostitution in the activities of Cibber and his like . At other times the setting is a regular dunces ’ club ( pp . 9 , 16 ) of the type chronicled in the pages of The Grub Street Journal . Towards the end of the poem it is an Assembly Room ( p. 19 ) presided over by the Goddess of Puffs ( a happy development of that more commonplace mythical figure “ Fame , ” Dulness ’ handmaiden in The New Dunciad ) who sets a test for the dunces and judges their performance . Only in this concluding episode can this rather shapeless poem ( which certainly is neither the mock epic nor the epistle that its title-page promises ) be assigned to any regular literary “ kind . ” This “ kind ” is that favorite of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries , the “ Sessions Poem . "[ 4 ]</p>
    <p n="6">“ Scriblerus ’ ” account of the sessions of the dunces is more allusive and particularized than the rest of the poem and consequently calls for somewhat more detailed comment . The chief cases at the sessions embrace the pamphlet battle of summer 1742 and theatrical rivalry in the 1741-42 London season . Cibber 's contribution to the paper-war , the Letter to Pope ( written according to Cibber “ At the Desire of several Persons of Quality ” ) , is introduced at page 17 and consigned on page 19 to William Lewis its printer . Hervey stalks in “ under VIRTUE 's Name ” in a “ borrow 'd Shape ” ( p. 24 ) , an allusion to the suggestion in the prefatory epistle to The Difference between Verbal and Practical Virtue that the poem was Cibber 's work . ( The “ horse him ” on 25 of The Scribleriad refers to Cibber 's adaptation of Shakespeare 's Richard III . ) Other pamphlets issued in August 1742 are mentioned on page 24 — Sawney and Colley ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>which “ Scriblerus ” calls “ CLODDY 's Dialogue , ” and A Blast upon Bays .<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span></p>
    <p n="7">Turning to the theatre , “ Scriblerus ” attacks all three major companies of the 1741-42 London season . He first introduces the two patented theatres , Drury Lane and Covent Garden , as rivals only in that debased dramatic form the pantomime . “ The angry Quack ” ( p. 25 ) is John Weaver , dancing master at Drury Lane and author of Anatomical and Mechanical Lectures upon Dancing ( 1721 ) , who claimed for himself<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>the credit of having originated pantomime upon the English stage . Weaver 's Orpheus and Eurydice at Drury Lane ( 1718 ) was hardly noticed , whereas John Rich had more recently bestowed “ an ORPHEUS on the Town ” ( p. 25 ) to very different effect . Rich 's Orpheus and Eurydice : With the Metamorphoses of Harlequin had opened on 12 February 1740 at Covent Garden , where he was manager . With Rich himself as Harlequin , it was a wild success that season — remaining a regular and highly popular afterpiece through the 1741-42 season and later .</p>
    <p n="8">What The Scribleriad tells us of “ Ambivius Turpio , the Stage ‘ Squire ” ( p. 26 ) suggests that he is to be identified with Charles Fleetwood , Esq .,<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>the wealthy , inexperienced amateur who managed Drury Lane ( this even though the original Ambivius Turpio was an actor , while Fleetwood , apparently , was not ) . All managers were frequently involved in disputes over actors ’ pay , but Fleetwood 's were the most notorious . It was the Drury Lane company that included “ the contending POLLYS ” ( p. 27 ) — Mrs. Cibber and Mrs. Clive who had bitterly quarrelled in 1736 over who should play that role in The Beggar 's Opera . Fleetwood , like Rich , gave a play for the benefit of Shakespeare 's monument in Westminster Abbey .<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>What little that Fleetwood knew of management he might well have learned from his one-time under-manager Theophilus Cibber , the “ young PTOLOMY ” ( p. 27 ) who , of course , had derived his knowledge from his “ great Sire alone . ”</p>
    <p n="9">The third theatre attacked in The Scribleriad is Goodman 's Fields . Its manager , Henry Giffard , had no patent , but contrived to evade the Licensing Act by the subterfuge of charging admission to a concert in two parts and then offering , “ gratis ” in the interval , a regular full-length play and afterpiece . The “ City Wrath ” ( p. 26 ) arose from the fact that the theatre was inside the City boundaries and was thought to encourage vice ; indeed , Sir John Barnard and his fellow aldermen managed to prevent it opening for the 1742-43 season and thereafter . Allusions in the poem are to the theatre 's highly successful 1741-42 season when Garrick sprang to fame as Cibber 's Richard III and also played Tate 's King Lear . On page 26 “ Scriblerus ” sneers at Garrick 's small stature ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>and refers to the impropriety of including the figure of Cato in the decor at Goodman 's Fields .</p>
    <p n="10">Targets outside the three theatrical companies are chosen from among the obvious ones already attacked by Pope . Mrs. Haywood , who in 1742 had turned publisher under the sign of “ Fame , ” is shown ( p. 21 ) appropriately enough as the first dunce to recognize the Goddess of Puffs . “ The Chief of the translating Bards ” ( p. 23 ) is the aged and industrious Ozell , and his fellows include Theobald and Thomas Cooke ( p. 24 ) .<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>The satire extends to touch the Administration and the City , with references to Britain 's hitherto inactive part in the War of the Austrian Succession ( p. 9 ) and to the manner in which stock-jobbers used false war news to aid their financial speculations ( p. 4 ) . It alludes to the “ grand Debate ” ( p. 8 ) of the committee set up in March 1742 to consider charges of corruption against the deposed Walpole ( created Lord Orford in February ) , which by the end of the summer had fizzled out , doubtless because so many members of the new government , including the numerous “ Peers new-made ” ( p. 9 ) , had shared Walpole 's peculations and wished to cover their tracks . When it hits at the King for his patronage of Cibber ( p. 13 ) , at the Queen for her ridiculous Merlin 's Cave and waxworks in Richmond Gardens ( p. 16 ) ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span>and at the Daily Gazeteer which , until Walpole 's fall , had been expensively subsidized from the government secret service fund and had numbered among its journalists such highly placed statesmen as Walpole 's brother Horatio — then , The Scribleriad suggests , there is a general conspiracy between high ranks and low to encourage Dulness . The Hervey-Cibber alliance is merely the most recent manifestation of this conspiracy .</p>
    <p n="11">Although it so obviously arises immediately out of the pamphlet battle of summer 1742 , The Scribleriad manages to range more widely in its satire than the anti-Pope lampoons it replies to . Further , it contrives to bring in Pope himself without degrading him to the level of his antagonists . This is done by mounting him on Pegasus and likening the dunces to curs ( pp . 13-14 ) , or comparing him to the sun whose warmth hatches out maggots ( pp . 6 , 29 ):</p>
    <p n="12">How many , who have Reams of Paper spoil 'd , Have often sleepless Nights obscurely toil 'd , And buried in their Eggs , like Silkworms , lay ‘ Till his warm Satire shew 'd them Life and Day ? Here then , my Sons , is all your living Hope , To be immortal Scriblers , rail at POPE .</p>
    <p n="13">The image , the attitude and the phrasing alike are borrowed from Pope , for The Scribleriad is highly derivative throughout . Only two or three times does “ Scriblerus ” improve at all upon the many hints he steals from Pope . I have already mentioned the Goddess Puffs , but other happy touches are to be found in a spirited travesty ( pp . 16-17 ) of the opening lines from Ovid 's Metamorphoses , Book XIII :[ 13 ]</p>
    <p n="14">The Chiefs were sate , the Scriblers waited round</p>

   <p>Mr. C — b — r to Mr. P .</p>
   <p>Have at you again , Sir . I gave you fair Warning that I would have the last Word ; and by —— ( I will not swear in Print ) you shall find me no Lyar . I own , I am greatly elate on the Laurels the Town has bestow 'd upon me for my Victory over you in my Prose Combat ; and , encouraged by that Triumph , I now resolve to fight you on your own Dunghil of Poetry , and with your own jingling Weapons of Rhyme and Metre . I confess I have had some Help ; but what then ? since the greatest Princes are rather proud than asham 'd of Allies and Auxiliaries when they make War in the Field , why should I decline such Assistance when I make War in the Press ? And since you thought most unrighteously and unjustly to fall upon me and crush me , only because you imagin 'd your Self strong and Me weak , as France fell upon the Queen of Hungary ; if I like her ( si parva licet componere magnis ) by first striking a bold and desperate Stroke myself with a little Success , have encouraged such a Friend to me , as England has been to her , to espouse my Cause , and turn all the Weight of the War upon you , till you wish you had never begun it ; with what reasonable and equitable Pleasure may I not pursue my Blow till I make you repent , by laying you on your Back , the ungrateful Returns you have made me for saving you from Destruction when you laid yourself on your Belly . I am , Sir , not your humble , but your devoted Servant ; for I will follow you as long as I live ; and as Terence says in the Eunuch , Ego pol te pro istis dictis &amp; factis , scelus , ulciscar , ut ne impune in nos illus eris .</p>
