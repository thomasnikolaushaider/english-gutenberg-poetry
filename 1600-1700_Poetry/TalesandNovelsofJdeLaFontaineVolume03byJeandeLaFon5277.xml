    <head>THE MULETEER</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">THE Lombard princes oft pervade my mind ;</l>
     <l n="2">The present tale Boccace relates you 'll find ;</l>
     <l n="3">Agiluf was the noble monarch 's name ;</l>
     <l n="4">Teudelingua he married , beauteous dame ,</l>
     <l n="5">The last king 's widow , who had left no heir ,</l>
     <l n="6">And whose dominions proved our prince 's share .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">No Beauty round compare could with the queen ;</l>
     <l n="8">And ev'ry blessing on the throne was seen ,</l>
     <l n="9">When Cupid , in a playful moment , came ,</l>
     <l n="10">And o'er Agiluf 's stable placed his flame ;</l>
     <l n="11">There left it carelessly to burn at will ,</l>
     <l n="12">Which soon began a muleteer to fill ,</l>
     <l n="13">With LOVE 'S all-powerful , all-consuming fire ,</l>
     <l n="14">That naught controls , and youthful breasts desire .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">THE muleteer was pleasing to the sight :</l>
     <l n="16">Gallant , good-humoured , airy , and polite ,</l>
     <l n="17">And ev'ry way his humble birth belied ;</l>
     <l n="18">A handsome person , nor was sense denied ;</l>
     <l n="19">He showed it well , for when the youth beheld ,</l>
     <l n="20">With eyes of love , the queen , who all excelled ,</l>
     <l n="21">And ev'ry effort anxiously had made ,</l>
     <l n="22">To stop the flames that would his heart invade ;</l>
     <l n="23">When vain it proved , he took a prudent part :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="24">WHO can , like Cupid , manage wily art ?</l>
     <l n="25">Whate'er stupidity we may discern ,</l>
     <l n="26">His pupils more within a day can learn ,</l>
     <l n="27">Than MASTERS knowledge in the schools can gain ,</l>
     <l n="28">Though they in study should ten years remain ;</l>
     <l n="29">The lowest clown he presently inspires ,</l>
     <l n="30">With ev'ry tendency that love requires ;</l>
     <l n="31">Of this our present tale 's a proof direct ,</l>
     <l n="32">And none that feel — its truths will e'er suspect :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">THE am'rous muleteer his thoughts employed ;</l>
     <l n="34">Consid'ring how his wish might be enjoyed .</l>
     <l n="35">Without success to certainty were brought ,</l>
     <l n="36">Life seemed to him not worth a slender thought ;</l>
     <l n="37">To hazard ev'ry thing ; to live or die !</l>
     <l n="38">Possession have !— or in the grave to lie !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="39">THE Lombard custom was , that when the king ,</l>
     <l n="40">Who slept not with his queen , ( a common thing</l>
     <l n="41">In other countries too ) , desired to greet</l>
     <l n="42">His royal consort , and in bed to meet ,</l>
     <l n="43">A night-gown solely o'er his back he threw ,</l>
     <l n="44">And then proceeded to the interview ,</l>
     <l n="45">Knocked softly at the door , on which a fair ,</l>
     <l n="46">Who waited on the queen with anxious care ,</l>
     <l n="47">Allowed the prince to enter ; took his light ,</l>
     <l n="48">( Which only glimmered in the midst of night ,)</l>
     <l n="49">Then put it out , and quickly left the room :—</l>
     <l n="50">A little lantern to dispel the gloom ,</l>
     <l n="51">With waxen taper that emitted rays —</l>
     <l n="52">In diff'rent countries various are their ways !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="53">OUR wily , prying , crafty muleteer ,</l>
     <l n="54">Knew well these forms were current through the year :</l>
     <l n="55">He , like the king , at night himself equipped ,</l>
     <l n="56">And to the queen 's superb apartment slipped .</l>
     <l n="57">His face concealed the fellow tried to keep ;</l>
     <l n="58">The waiting dame was more than half asleep ;</l>
     <l n="59">The lover got access :— soon all was clear ;</l>
     <l n="60">The prince 's coming he had but to fear ,</l>
     <l n="61">And , as the latter had , throughout the day ,</l>
     <l n="62">The chase attended an extensive way ,</l>
     <l n="63">‘ Twas more than probable he 'd not be led ,</l>
     <l n="64">( Since such fatigue he 'd had ,) to quit his bed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="65">PERFUMED , quite neat , and lively as a bird ,</l>
     <l n="66">Our spark ( safe entered ) uttered not a word .</l>
     <l n="67">‘ Twas often customary with the king ,</l>
     <l n="68">When state affairs , or other weighty thing ,</l>
     <l n="69">Displeasure gave , to take of love his fill ,</l>
     <l n="70">Yet let his tongue the while continue still .</l>
     <l n="71">A singularity we needs must own ,</l>
     <l n="72">With this the wife was long familiar grown .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="73">OUR am'rous wight more joys than one received ,</l>
     <l n="74">If our narrator of the tale 's believed ;</l>
     <l n="75">( In bed a muleteer is worth three kings ,</l>
     <l n="76">And value oft is found in humble things . )</l>
     <l n="77">The queen began to think her husband 's rage</l>
     <l n="78">Had proved a stimulus such wars to wage ,</l>
     <l n="79">And made him wond'rous stout in pleasure 's sport ,</l>
     <l n="80">Though all the while his thoughts were - ‘ bout the court .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="81">WITH perfect justice Heav'n its gifts bestows ;</l>
     <l n="82">But equal talents all should not compose .</l>
     <l n="83">The prince 's virtues doubtless were designed ,</l>
     <l n="84">To take command , and govern o'er mankind .</l>
     <l n="85">The lawyer , points of difficulty views ,</l>
     <l n="86">Decides with judgment , and the truth pursues .</l>
     <l n="87">In Cupid 's scenes the muleteer succeeds :—</l>
     <l n="88">Each has his part :— none universal meeds .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="89">WITH pleasures feasted , our gallant retired ,</l>
     <l n="90">Before the morn fresh blushes had acquired .</l>
     <l n="91">But scarcely had he left the tender scene ,</l>
     <l n="92">‘ Ere king Agiluf came to see his queen ,</l>
     <l n="93">Who much surprise expressed , and to him said :</l>
     <l n="94">My dear , I know your love , but from this bed ,</l>
     <l n="95">You 'll recollect how recently you went ,</l>
     <l n="96">And having wonders done , should be content .</l>
     <l n="97">For heav'n ' s sake , consider more your health ;</l>
     <l n="98">‘ Tis dearer far to me than Croesus ’ wealth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="99">WITHIN the royal breast suspicions rose ,</l>
     <l n="100">But nothing then the monarch would disclose .</l>
     <l n="101">He instantly withdrew without a word ;</l>
     <l n="102">His sentiments to speak had been absurd ,</l>
     <l n="103">And to the stable flew , since he believed</l>
     <l n="104">The circumstances , which his bosom grieved ,</l>
     <l n="105">Whate'er mysterious doubts might then appear ,</l>
     <l n="106">Proceeded from some am'rous muleteer .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="107">WHEN round the dorture he began to creep ,</l>
     <l n="108">The troop appeared as if dissolved in sleep ,</l>
     <l n="109">And so they truly were , save our gallant ,</l>
     <l n="110">Whose terrors made him tremble , sigh , and pant :</l>
     <l n="111">No light the king had got ; it still was dark ;</l>
     <l n="112">Agiluf groped about to find the spark ,</l>
     <l n="113">Persuaded that the culprit might be known ,</l>
     <l n="114">By rapid beating of the pulse alone .</l>
     <l n="115">The thought was good ; to feel the prince began ,</l>
     <l n="116">And at the second venture , found his man ,</l>
     <l n="117">Who , whether from the pleasures he 'd enjoyed ,</l>
     <l n="118">Or fear , or dread discov'ry to avoid ,</l>
     <l n="119">Experienced ( spite of ev'ry wily art ,)</l>
     <l n="120">At once quick beating of the pulse and heart .</l>
     <l n="121">In doubt how this adventure yet might end ,</l>
     <l n="122">He thought to seem asleep would him befriend .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="123">MEANWHILE the king , though not without much pains ,</l>
     <l n="124">Obtained the scissors used for horses ’ manes .</l>
     <l n="125">With these , he said , I 'll mark the fond gallant ,</l>
     <l n="126">That I may know again the one I want .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="127">THE monarch from the muleteer with care ,</l>
     <l n="128">In front , snipt off a bulky lock of hair .</l>
     <l n="129">This having done , he suddenly withdrew ;</l>
     <l n="130">But carelessly away the trophy threw ;</l>
     <l n="131">Of which the sly gallant advantage took ,</l>
     <l n="132">And thus the prince 's subtle project shook ;</l>
     <l n="133">For instantly began our artful spark ,</l>
     <l n="134">His fellow servants like himself to mark .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="135">WHEN day arrived the monarch was surprised ,</l>
     <l n="136">To see each muleteer alike disguised ;</l>
     <l n="137">No hair in front of either now was seen ;</l>
     <l n="138">Why , how is this ? said he : What can it mean ?</l>
     <l n="139">Fifteen or more , if I believe my sight ,</l>
     <l n="140">My wife has satisfied this very night .</l>
     <l n="141">Well ! well ! he 'll now escape if mum he prove ;</l>
     <l n="142">But there again I trust he ne'er shall move .</l>

    <head>THE SERVANT GIRL JUSTIFIED</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">BOCCACE alone is not my only source ;</l>
     <l n="2">T'another shop I now shall have recourse ;</l>
     <l n="3">Though , certainly , this famed Italian wit</l>
     <l n="4">Has many stories for my purpose fit .</l>
     <l n="5">But since of diff'rent dishes we should taste ;</l>
     <l n="6">Upon an ancient work my hands I 've placed ;</l>
     <l n="7">Where full a hundred narratives are told ,</l>
     <l n="8">And various characters we may behold ;</l>
     <l n="9">From life , Navarre 's fair queen the fact relates ;</l>
     <l n="10">My story int'rest in her page creates ;</l>
     <l n="11">Beyond dispute from her we always find ,</l>
     <l n="12">Simplicity with striking art combin 'd .</l>
     <l n="13">Yet , whether ‘ tis the queen who writes , or not ;</l>
     <l n="14">I shall , as usual , here and there allot</l>
     <l n="15">Whate'er additions requisite appear ;</l>
     <l n="16">Without such license I 'd not persevere ,</l>
     <l n="17">But quit , at once , narrations of the sort ;</l>
     <l n="18">Some may be long , though others are too short .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="19">LET us proceed , howe'er ( our plan explained :)</l>
     <l n="20">A pretty servant-girl a man retain 'd .</l>
     <l n="21">She pleas 'd his eye , and presently he thought ,</l>
     <l n="22">With ease she might to am'rous sports be brought ;</l>
     <l n="23">He prov 'd not wrong ; the wench was blithe and gay ,</l>
     <l n="24">A buxom lass , most able ev'ry way .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="25">AT dawn , one summer 's morn , the spark was led</l>
     <l n="26">To rise , and leave his wife asleep in bed ;</l>
     <l n="27">He sought at once the garden , where he found</l>
     <l n="28">The servant-girl collecting flow'rs around ,</l>
     <l n="29">To make a nosegay for his better half ,</l>
     <l n="30">Whose birth-day ‘ twas :— he soon began to laugh ,</l>
     <l n="31">And while the ranging of the flow'rs he prais 'd ,</l>
     <l n="32">The servant 's neckerchief he slyly rais 'd .</l>
     <l n="33">Who , suddenly , on feeling of the hand ,</l>
     <l n="34">Resistance feign 'd , and seem 'd to make a stand ;</l>
     <l n="35">But since these liberties were nothing new ,</l>
     <l n="36">They other fun and frolicks would pursue ;</l>
     <l n="37">The nosegay at the fond gallant was thrown ;</l>
     <l n="38">The flow'rs he kiss 'd , and now more ardent grown</l>
     <l n="39">They romp 'd and rattl 'd , play 'd and skipt around ;</l>
     <l n="40">At length the fair one fell upon the ground ;</l>
     <l n="41">Our am'rous spark advantage took of this ,</l>
     <l n="42">And nothing with the couple seem 'd amiss .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="43">UNLUCKILY , a neighbour 's prying eyes</l>
     <l n="44">Beheld their playful pranks with great surprise ,</l>
     <l n="45">She , from her window , could the scene o'erlook ;</l>
     <l n="46">When this the fond gallant observ 'd , he shook ;</l>
     <l n="47">Said he , by heav'ns ! our frolicking is seen ,</l>
     <l n="48">By that old haggard , envious , prying quean ;</l>
     <l n="49">But do not heed it ; instantly he chose</l>
     <l n="50">To run and wake his wife , who quickly rose ;—</l>
     <l n="51">So much the dame he fondl 'd and caress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="52">The garden walk she took at his request ,</l>
     <l n="53">To have a nosegay , where he play 'd anew</l>
     <l n="54">Pranks just the same as those of recent view ,</l>
     <l n="55">Which highly gratified our lady fair ,</l>
     <l n="56">Who felt dispos 'd , and would at eve repair ,</l>
     <l n="57">To her good neighbour , whom she bursting found ,</l>
     <l n="58">With what she 'd seen that morn upon the ground .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="59">THE usual greetings o'er , our envious dame ,</l>
     <l n="60">With scowling brow exclaim 'd ,— my dear , your fame ,</l>
     <l n="61">I love too much not fully to detail ,</l>
     <l n="62">What I have witnessed , and with truth bewail ;</l>
     <l n="63">Will you continue , in your house to keep</l>
     <l n="64">A girl , whose conduct almost makes me weep ?</l>
     <l n="65">Anon I 'd kick her from your house , I say ;</l>
     <l n="66">The strumpet should not stay another day .</l>
     <l n="67">The wife replied , you surely are deceiv 'd ;</l>
     <l n="68">An honest , virtuous creature she 's believ 'd .</l>
     <l n="69">Well , I can easily , my friend , suppose ,</l>
     <l n="70">Rejoin 'd the neighbour , whence this favour flows ;</l>
     <l n="71">But look about , and be convinc 'd , this morn</l>
     <l n="72">From my own window ( true as you are born ,)</l>
     <l n="73">Within the garden I your husband spi 'd</l>
     <l n="74">And presently the servant girl I ey 'd ;</l>
     <l n="75">At one another various flow'rs they threw ,</l>
     <l n="76">And then the minx a little graver grew .</l>
     <l n="77">I understand you , cried the list'ning fair ;</l>
     <l n="78">You are deceiv 'd :— myself alone was there .</l>

     <l n="125">THE second dame , whose husband was so meek ,</l>
     <l n="126">That only from her lips the truth he 'd seek ,</l>
     <l n="127">When seated with him ‘ neath a pear tree 's shade ,</l>

     <l n="129">The story I shall presently relate ;</l>
     <l n="130">The butler , strong , well dress 'd , and full of prate :</l>

     <l n="150">Pray wait till by and by ; you 're much to blame ;</l>
     <l n="151">Besides , the nights are long enough you 'll find ;</l>
