    <docTitle><titlePart>AN ESSAY ON CRITICISM . BY ALEXANDER POPE , WITH INTRODUCTORY AND EXPLANATORY NOTES . ALEXANDER POPE .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>This eminent English poet was born in<settlement>London</settlement>, May 21 ,<date>1688</date>. His parents were Roman Catholics , and to this faith the poet adhered , thus debarring himself from public office and employment . His father , a linen merchant , having saved a moderate competency , withdrew from business , and settled on a small estate he had purchased in Windsor Forest . He died at Chiswick , in<date>1717</date>. His son shortly afterwards took a long lease of a house and five acres of land at Twickenham , on the banks of the Thames , whither he retired with his widowed mother , to whom he was tenderly attached and where he resided till death , cultivating his little domain with exquisite taste and skill , and embellishing it with a grotto , temple , wilderness , and other adjuncts poetical and picturesque . In this famous villa Pope was visited by the most celebrated wits , statesmen and beauties of the day , himself being the most popular and successful poet of his age . His early years were spent at Binfield , within the range of the Royal Forest . He received some education at little Catholic schools , but was his own instructor after his twelfth year . He never was a profound or accurate scholar , but he read Latin poets with ease and delight , and acquired some Greek , French , and Italian . He was a poet almost from infancy , he “ lisped in numbers , ” and when a mere youth surpassed all his contemporaries in metrical harmony and correctness . His pastorals and some translations appeared in<date>1709</date>, but were written three or four years earlier . These were followed by the Essay on Criticism ,<date>1711</date>; Rape of the Lock ( when completed , the most graceful , airy , and imaginative of his works ) ,<date>1712-1714</date>; Windsor Forest ,<date>1713</date>; Temple of Fame ,<date>1715</date>. In a collection of his works printed in<date>1717</date>he included the Epistle of Eloisa and Elegy on an Unfortunate Lady , two poems inimitable for pathetic beauty and finished melodious versification . From<date>1715</date>till<date>1726</date>Pope was chiefly engaged on his translations of the Iliad and Odyssey , which , though wanting in time Homeric simplicity , naturalness , and grandeur , are splendid poems . In<date>1728-29</date>he published his greatest satire — the Dunciad , an attack on all poetasters and pretended wits , and on all other persons against whom the sensitive poet had conceived any enmity . In<date>1737</date>he gave to the world a volume of his Literary Correspondence , containing some pleasant gossip and observations , with choice passages of description but it appears that the correspondence was manufactured for publication not composed of actual letters addressed to the parties whose names are given , and the collection was introduced to the public by means of an elaborate stratagem on the part of the scheming poet . Between the years<date>1731</date>and<date>1739</date>he issued a series of poetical essays moral and philosophical , with satires and imitations of Horace , all admirable for sense , wit , spirit and brilliancy of these delightful productions , the most celebrated is the Essay on Man to which Bolingbroke is believed to have contributed the spurious philosophy and false sentiment , but its merit consists in detached passages , descriptions , and pictures . A fourth book to the Dunciad , containing many beautiful and striking lines and a general revision of his works , closed the poet 's literary cares and toils . He died on the 30th of May ,<date>1744</date>, and was buried in the church at Twickenham . Pope was of very diminutive stature and deformed from his birth . His physical infirmity , susceptible temperament , and incessant study rendered his life one long disease . He was , as his friend Lord Chesterfield said , “ the most irritable of all the genus irritabile vatum , offended with trifles and never forgetting or forgiving them . ” His literary stratagems , disguises , assertions , denials , and ( we must add ) misrepresentations would fill volumes . Yet when no disturbing jealousy vanity , or rivalry intervened was generous and affectionate , and he had a manly , independent spirit . As a poet he was deficient in originality and creative power , and thus was inferior to his prototype , Dryden , but as a literary artist , and brilliant declaimer satirist and moralizer in verse he is still unrivaled . He is the English Horace , and will as surely descend with honors to the latest posterity .</docImprint>

    <head>WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1709</head>
    <note>The title , An Essay on Criticism hardly indicates all that is included in the poem . It would have been impossible to give a full and exact idea of the art of poetical criticism without entering into the consideration of the art of poetry . Accordingly Pope has interwoven the precepts of both throughout the poem which might more properly have been styled an essay on the Art of Criticism and of Poetry .</note>

      <l n="3">But of the two less dangerous is the offense</l>
      <l n="4">To tire our patience than mislead our sense</l>
      <l n="5">Some few in that but numbers err in this ,</l>
      <l n="6">Ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss ,</l>
      <l n="7">A fool might once himself alone expose ,</l>

      <l n="12">True taste as seldom is the critic share</l>
      <l n="13">Both must alike from Heaven derive their light ,</l>
      <l n="14">These born to judge as well as those to write</l>
      <l n="15">Let such teach others who themselves excel ,</l>

      <l n="17">Authors are partial to their wit , ‘ tis true<span type="note_anchor">[ 17 ]</span></l>
      <l n="18">But are not critics to their judgment too ?</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="3">
      <l n="19">Yet if we look more closely we shall find</l>
      <l n="20">Most have the seeds of judgment in their mind</l>
      <l n="21">Nature affords at least a glimmering light</l>
      <l n="22">The lines though touched but faintly are drawn right ,</l>
      <l n="23">But as the slightest sketch if justly traced</l>
      <l n="24">Is by ill coloring but the more disgraced</l>
      <l n="25">So by false learning is good sense defaced</l>
      <l n="26">Some are bewildered in the maze of schools<span type="note_anchor">[ 26 ]</span></l>
      <l n="27">And some made coxcombs nature meant but fools</l>
      <l n="28">In search of wit these lose their common sense</l>
      <l n="29">And then turn critics in their own defense</l>
      <l n="30">Each burns alike who can or cannot write</l>
      <l n="31">Or with a rival 's or an eunuch 's spite</l>
      <l n="32">All fools have still an itching to deride</l>
      <l n="33">And fain would be upon the laughing side</l>
      <l n="34">If Maevius scribble in Apollo 's spite<span type="note_anchor">[ 34 ]</span></l>
      <l n="35">There are who judge still worse than he can write .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="4">
      <l n="36">Some have at first for wits then poets passed</l>
      <l n="37">Turned critics next and proved plain fools at last</l>
      <l n="38">Some neither can for wits nor critics pass</l>
      <l n="39">As heavy mules are neither horse nor ass .</l>
      <l n="40">Those half-learned witlings , numerous in our isle ,</l>
      <l n="41">As half-formed insects on the banks of Nile</l>
      <l n="42">Unfinished things one knows not what to call</l>
      <l n="43">Their generation is so equivocal</l>
      <l n="44">To tell them would a hundred tongues require ,</l>
      <l n="45">Or one vain wits that might a hundred tire .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="5">
      <l n="46">But you who seek to give and merit fame ,</l>
      <l n="47">And justly bear a critic 's noble name ,</l>
      <l n="48">Be sure yourself and your own reach to know</l>
      <l n="49">How far your genius taste and learning go .</l>
      <l n="50">Launch not beyond your depth , but be discreet</l>
      <l n="51">And mark that point where sense and dullness meet .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="6">
      <l n="52">Nature to all things fixed the limits fit</l>
      <l n="53">And wisely curbed proud man 's pretending wit .</l>
      <l n="54">As on the land while here the ocean gains .</l>
      <l n="55">In other parts it leaves wide sandy plains</l>
      <l n="56">Thus in the soul while memory prevails ,</l>
      <l n="57">The solid power of understanding fails</l>
      <l n="58">Where beams of warm imagination play ,</l>
      <l n="59">The memory 's soft figures melt away</l>
      <l n="60">One science only will one genius fit ,</l>
      <l n="61">So vast is art , so narrow human wit</l>
      <l n="62">Not only bounded to peculiar arts ,</l>
      <l n="63">But oft in those confined to single parts</l>
      <l n="64">Like kings , we lose the conquests gained before ,</l>
      <l n="65">By vain ambition still to make them more</l>
      <l n="66">Each might his several province well command ,</l>
      <l n="67">Would all but stoop to what they understand .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="7">
      <l n="68">First follow nature and your judgment frame</l>
      <l n="69">By her just standard , which is still the same .</l>
      <l n="70">Unerring nature still divinely bright ,</l>
      <l n="71">One clear , unchanged and universal light ,</l>
      <l n="72">Life force and beauty , must to all impart ,</l>
      <l n="73">At once the source and end and test of art</l>
      <l n="74">Art from that fund each just supply provides ,</l>
      <l n="75">Works without show and without pomp presides</l>
      <l n="76">In some fair body thus the informing soul</l>
      <l n="77">With spirits feeds , with vigor fills the whole ,</l>

      <l n="86">The winged courser , like a generous horse ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 86 ]</span></l>

   <note>Lines 183 , 184 : Secure from flames .— The poet probably alludes to such fires as those in which the Alexandrine and Palatine Libraries were destroyed . From envy 's fiercer rage .— Probably he alludes to the writings of such men as Maevius ( see note to line 34 ) and Zoilus , a sophist and grammarian of Amphipolis , who distinguished himself by his criticism on Isocrates , Plato , and Homer , receiving the nickname of Homeromastic ( chastiser of Homer ) . Destructive war — Probably an allusion to the irruption of the barbarians into the south of Europe . And all-involving age ; that is , time .

   <note>Line 270 : Dennis , the son of a saddler in London , born 1657 , was a mediocre writer , and rather better critic of the time , with whom Pope came a good deal into collision . Addison 's tragedy of Cato , for which Pope had written a prologue , had been attacked by Dennis . Pope , to defend Addison , wrote an imaginary report , pretending to be written by a notorious quack mad-doctor of the day , entitled The Narrative of Dr. Robert Norris on the Frenz of F. D. Dennis replied to it by his Character of Mr. Pope . Ultimately Pope gave him a place in his Dunciad , and wrote a prologue for his benefit .</note>

The success of the attempt has not been very complete except in the second two lines , expressing the dash and roar of the waves , and in the last two , expressing the skimming , continuous motion of Camilla . What he refers to is the onomatopoeia of Homer and Virgil in the passages alluded to . Ajax , the son of Telamon , was , next to Achilles , the bravest of all the Greeks in the Trojan war . When the Greeks were challenged by Hector he was chosen their champion and it was in their encounter that he seized a huge stone and hurled it at Hector .</p>

They engaged in a conflict with Zeus , the king of heaven , which lasted ten years . They were completely defeated , and hurled down into a dungeon below Tartarus . Very often they are confounded with the Giants , as has apparently been done here by Pope . These were a later progeny of the same parents , and in revenge for what had been done to the Titans , conspired to dethrone Zeus . In order to scale heaven , they piled Mount Ossa upon Pelion , and would have succeeded in their attempt if Zeus had not called in the assistance of his son Hercules .</note>
