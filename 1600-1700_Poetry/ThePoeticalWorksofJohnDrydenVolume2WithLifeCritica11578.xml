   <head>CRITICAL ESTIMATE</head>
   <head>OF THE</head>
   <head>GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN .</head>
   <p>In our Life of Dryden we promised to say something about the question , how far is a poet , particularly in the moral tendency and taste of his writings , to be tried — and either condemned or justified — by the character and spirit of his age ? To a rapid consideration of this question we now proceed , before examining the constituent elements or the varied fruits of the poet 's genius .</p>
   <p>And here , unquestionably , there are extremes , which every critic should avoid . Some imagine that a writer of a former century should be tried , either by the standard which prevails in the cultured and civilised nineteenth , or by the exposition of moral principles and practice which is to be found in the Scriptures . Now , it is obviously , so far as taste is concerned , as unjust to judge a book written in the style and manner of one age by the merely arbitrary and conventional rules established in another , as to judge the dress of our ancestors by the fashions of the present day . And in respect of morality , it is as unfair to visit with the same measure of condemnation offences against decorum or decency , committed by writers living before or living after the promulgation of the Christian code , as it would be to class the Satyrs , Priapi , and Bacchantes of an antique sculptor , with their imitations , by inferior and coarser artists , in later times . There must be a certain measure of allowance made for the errors of Genius when it was working as the galley-slave of its tradition and period , and when it had not yet received the Divine Light which , shining into the world from above , has supplied men with higher æsthetic as well as spiritual models of principles , and revealed man 's body to be the temple of the Holy Ghost . To look for our modern philanthropy in that “ Greek Gazette , ” the Iliad of Homer — to expect that reverence for the Supreme Being which the Bible has taught us in the Metamorphoses of Ovid — or to seek that refinement of manners and language which has only of late prevailed amongst us , in the plays of Aristophanes and Plautus — were very foolish and very vain . In ages not so ancient , and which have revolved since the dawn of Christianity , a certain coarseness of thought and language has been prevalent ; and for it still larger allowance should be made , because it has been applied to simplicity rather than to sensuality — to rustic barbarism , not to civilised corruption — and carries along with it a rough raciness , and a reference to the sturdy aboriginal beast — just as acorns in the trough suggest the immemorial forests where they grew , and the rich greenswards on which they fell .</p>
   <p>In two cases , it thus appears , should the severest censor be prepared to modify his condemnation of the bad taste or the impurity to be found in writers of genius — first , in that of a civilization , perfect in its kind , but destitute of the refining and sublimating element which a revelation only can supply ; and , secondly , in that of those ages in which the lights of knowledge and religion are contending with the gloom of barbarian rudeness . Perhaps there are still two other cases capable of palliation — that of a mind so constituted as to be nothing , if not a mirror of its age , and faithfully and irresistibly reflecting even its vices and pollutions ; or that of a mind morbidly in love with the morbidities and the vile passages of human nature . But suppose the case of a writer , sitting under the full blaze of Gospel truth , professedly a believer in the Gospel , and intimately acquainted with its oracles , living in a late and dissipated , not a rude and simple age — possessed of varied and splendid talents , which qualified him to make as well as to mirror , and with a taste naturally sound and manly , who should yet seek to shock the feelings of the pious , to gratify the low tendencies , and fire to frenzy the evil passions of his period — he is not to be shielded by the apology that he has only conformed to the bad age on which he was so unfortunate as to fall . Prejudice may , indeed , put in such a plea in his defence ; but the inevitable eye of common sense , distinguishing between necessity and choice , between coarseness and corruption , between a man 's passively yielding to and actively inviting and encouraging the currents of false taste and immorality which he must encounter , will find that plea nugatory , and bring in against the author a verdict of guilty .</p>
   <p>Now this , we fear , is exactly the case of Dryden . He was neither a “ barbarian ” nor a “ Scythian . ” He was a conscious artist , not a high though helpless reflector of his age . He had not , we think , like his relative , Swift , originally any diseased delight in filth for its own sake ; was not — shall we say ?— a natural , but an artificial Yahoo . He wielded a power over the public mind , approaching the absolute , and which he could have turned to virtuous , instead of vicious account — at first , it might have been amidst considerable resistance and obloquy , but ultimately with triumphant success . This , however , he never attempted , and must therefore be classed , in this respect , with such writers as Byron , whose powers gilded their pollutions , less than their pollutions degraded and defiled their powers ; nay , perhaps he should be ranked even lower than the noble bard , whose obscenities are not so gross , and who had , besides , to account for them the double palliations of passion and of despair .</p>
   <p>In these remarks we refer principally to Dryden 's plays ; for his poems , as we remarked in the Life , are ( with the exception of a few of the Prologues , which we print under protest ) in a great measure free from impurity . We pass gladly to consider him in his genius and his poetical works . The most obvious , and among the most remarkable characteristics of his poetic style , are its wondrous elasticity and ease of movement . There is never for an instant any real or apparent effort , any straining for effect , any of that “ double , double , toil and trouble , ” by which many even of the weird cauldrons in which Genius forms her creations are disturbed and bedimmed . That power of doing everything with perfect and conscious ease , which Dugald Stewart has ascribed to Barrow and to Horsley in prose , distinguished Dryden in poetry . Whether he discusses the deep questions of fate and foreknowledge in “ Religio Laici , ” or lashes Shaftesbury in the “ Medal , ” or pours a torrent of contempt on Shadwell in “ MacFlecknoe , ” or describes the fire of London in the “ Annus Mirabilis , ” or soars into lyric enthusiasm in his “ Ode on the Death of Mrs Killigrew , ” and “ Alexander 's Feast , ” or paints a tournament in “ Palamon and Arcite , ” or a fairy dance in the “ Flower and the Leaf , ” — he is always at home , and always aware that he is . His consciousness of his own powers amounts to exultation . He is like the steed who glories in that tremendous gallop which affects the spectator with fear . Indeed , we never can separate our conception of Dryden 's vigorous and vaulting style from the image of a noble horse , devouring the dust of the field , clearing obstacles at a bound , taking up long leagues as a little thing , and the very strength and speed of whose motion give it at a distance the appearance of smoothness . Pope speaks of his</p>
   <p>“ Long resounding march , and energy divine . ”</p>
   <p>Perhaps “ ease divine ” had been words more characteristic of that almost superhuman power of language by which he makes the most obstinate materials pliant , melts down difficulties as if by the touch of magic , and , to resume the former figure , comes into the goal without a hair turned on his mane , or a single sweat-drop confessing effort or extraordinary exertion . We know no poet since Homer who can be compared to Dryden in this respect , except Scott , who occasionally , in “ Marmion , ” and the “ Lay of the Last Minstrel , ” exhibits the same impetuous ease and fiery fluent movement . Scott does not , however , in general , carry the same weight as the other ; and the species of verse he uses , in comparison to the heroic rhyme of Dryden , gives you often the impression of a hard trot , rather than of a “ long-resounding ” and magnificent gallop . Scott exhibits in his poetry the soul of a warrior ; but it is of a warrior of the Border — somewhat savage and coarse . Dryden can , for the nonce at least , assume the appearance , and display the spirit , of a knight of ancient chivalry — gallant , accomplished , elegant , and gay .</p>
   <p>Next to this poet 's astonishing ease , spirit , and elastic vigour , may be ranked his clear , sharp intellect . He may be called more a logician than a poet . He reasons often , and always acutely , and his rhyme , instead of shackling , strengthens the movement of his argumentation . Parts of his “ Religio Laici ” and the “ Hind and Panther ” resemble portions of Duns Scotus or Aquinas set on fire . Indeed , keen , strong intellect , inflamed with passion , and inspirited by that “ ardour and impetuosity of mind ” which Wordsworth is compelled to allow to him , rather than creative or original genius , is the differentia of Dryden . We have compared him to a courser , but he was not one of those coursers of Achilles , who fed on no earthly food , but on the golden barley of heaven , having sprung from the gods —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">[ Greek : Xanthon kai Balion , to ama pnoiaesi , petesthaen .</l>
     <l n="2">Tous eteke Zephuro anemo Arpua Podargae . ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Dryden resembled rather the mortal steed which was yoked with these immortal twain , the brood of Zephyr and the Harpy Podarga ; only we can hardly say of the poet what Homer says of Pedasus —</p>
   <note>Greek : Os kai thnaetos eon , epeth ippois athanatoisi .</note>
   <p>He was not , although a mortal , able to keep up with the immortal coursers . His path was on the plains or table-lands of earth — never or seldom in “ cloudland , gorgeous land , ” or through the aerial altitudes which stretch away and above the clouds to the gates of heaven . He can hardly be said to have possessed the power of sublimity , in the high sense of that term , as the power of sympathising with the feeling of the Infinite . Often he gives us the impression of the picturesque , of the beautiful , of the heroic , of the nobly disdainful — but never ( when writing , at least , entirely from his own mind ) of that infinite and nameless grandeur which the imaginative soul feels shed on it from the multitudinous waves of ocean — from the cataract leaping from his rock , as if to consummate an act of prayer to God — from the hum of great assemblies of men — from the sight of far-extended wastes and wildernesses — and from the awful silence , and the still more mysterious sparkle of the midnight stars . This sense of the presence of the shadow of immensity — immensity itself cannot be felt any more than measured — this sight like that vouchsafed to Moses of the “ backparts ” of the Divine — the Divine itself cannot be seen — has been the inspiration of all the highest poetry of the world — of the “ Paradise Lost , ” of the “ Divina Commedia , ” of the “ Night Thoughts , ” of Wordsworth and Coleridge , of “ Festus , ” and , highest far , of the Hebrew Prophets , as they cry , “ Whither can we go from Thy presence ? whither can we flee from Thy Spirit ? ” Such poets have resembled a blind man , who feels , although he cannot see , that a stranger of commanding air is in the room beside him ; so they stand awe-struck in the “ wind of the going ” of a majestic and unseen Being . This feeling differs from mysticism , inasmuch as it is connected with a reality , while the mystic dreams a vague and unsupported dream , and the poetry it produces is simply the irresistible cry springing from the perception of this wondrous Some One who is actually near them . The feeling is connected , in general , with a lofty moral and religious nature ; and yet not always , since , while wanting in Dryden , we find it intensely discovered , although in an imperfect and perverted shape , in Byron and Rousseau .</p>
   <p>In Dryden certainly it exists not . We do not — and in this we have Jeffrey 's opinion to back us — remember a single line in his poetry that can be called sublime , or , which is the same thing , that gives us a thrilling shudder , as if a god or a ghost were passing by . Pleasure , high excitement ,— rapture even , he often produces ; but such a feeling as is created by that line of Milton ,</p>
   <p>“ To bellow through the vast and boundless deep , ”</p>
   <p>never . Compare , in proof of this , the description of the tournament in “ Palamon and Arcite ” — amazingly spirited as it is — to the description of the war-horse in Job ; or , if that appear too high a test , to the contest of Achilles with the rivers in Homer ; to the war of the Angels , and the interrupted preparations for contest between Gabriel and Satan in Milton ; to the contest between Apollyon and Christian in the “ Pilgrim 's Progress ; ” to some of the combats in Spenser ; and to that wonderful one of the Princess and the Magician in midair in the “ Arabian Nights , ” in order to understand the distinction between the most animated literal pictures of battle and those into which the element of imagination is strongly injected by the poet , who can , to the inevitable shiver of human nature at the sight of struggle and carnage , add the far more profound and terrible shiver , only created by a vision of the concomitants , the consequences — the UNSEEN BORDERS of the bloody scene . Take these lines , for instance :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ They look anew : the beauteous form of fight</l>
     <l n="2">Is changed , and war appears a grisly sight ;</l>
     <l n="3">Two troops in fair array one moment showed —</l>
     <l n="4">The next , a field with fallen bodies strowed ;</l>
     <l n="5">Not half the number in their seats are found ,</l>
     <l n="6">But men and steeds lie grovelling on the ground .</l>
     <l n="7">The points of spears are stuck within the shield ,</l>
     <l n="8">The steeds without their riders scour the field ;</l>
     <l n="9">The knights , unhorsed , on foot renew the fight —</l>
     <l n="10">The glittering faulchions cast a gleaming light ;</l>
     <l n="11">Hauberks and helms are hew 'd with many a wound ,</l>
     <l n="12">Out-spins the streaming blood , and dyes the ground . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>This is vigorous and vivid , but is not imaginative or suggestive . It does not carry away the mind from the field to bring back thoughts and images , which shall , so to speak , brood over , and aggravate the general horror . It is , in a word , plain , good painting , but it is not poetry . There is not a metaphor , such as “ he laugheth at the shaking of a spear , ” in it all .</p>
   <p>In connexion with this defect in imagination is the lack of natural imagery in Dryden 's poetry . Wordsworth , indeed , greatly overcharges the case , when he says ( in a letter to Scott ) , “ that there is not a single image from nature in the whole body of his poetry . ” We have this minute taken up the “ Hind and the Panther , ” and find two images from nature in one page :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ As where in fields the fairy rounds are seen ,</l>
     <l n="2">A rank sour herbage rises on the green ;</l>
     <l n="3">So , ” &amp; c .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">And a few lines down :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">“ As where the lightning runs along the ground ,</l>
     <l n="6">No husbandry can heal the blasting wound . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="7">And some pages farther on occurs a description of Spring , not unworthy</l>
     <l n="8">of Wordsworth himself ; beginning —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="9">“ New blossoms flourish and new flowers arise ,</l>
     <l n="10">As God had been abroad , and walking there ,</l>
     <l n="11">Had left his footsteps , and reform 'd the year . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Still it is true , that , taking his writings as a whole , they are thin in natural images ; and even those which occur , are often rather the echoes of his reading , than the results of his observation . And what Wordsworth adds is , we fear , true ; in his translation of Virgil , where Virgil can be fairly said to have his eye upon his object , Dryden always spoils the passage . The reason of this , apart from his want of high imaginative sympathy , may be found in his long residence in London ; and his lack of that intimate daily familiarity with natural scenes , which can alone supply thorough knowledge , or enkindle thorough love . Nature is not like the majority of other mistresses . Her charms deepen the longer she is known ; and he that loves her most warmly , has watched her with the narrowest inspection . She can bear the keenest glances of the microscope , and to see all her glory would exhaust an antediluvian life . The appetite , in her case , “ grows with what it feeds on ; ” but such an appetite was not Dryden 's .</p>
   <p>Another of his great defects is , in true tenderness of feeling . He has very few passages which can be called pathetic . His Elegies and funeral Odes , such as those on “ Mrs Killigrew ” and “ Eleonora , ” are eloquent ; but they move you to admiration , not to tears . Dryden 's long immersion in the pollutions of the playhouses , had combined , with his long course of domestic infelicity , and his employments as a hack author , a party scribe , and a satirist , to harden his heart , to brush away whatever fine bloom of feeling there had been originally on his mind , and to render him incapable of even simulating the softer emotions of the soul . But for the discovered fact , that he was in early life a lover of his relative , Honor Driden , you would have judged him from his works incapable of a pure passion . “ Lust hard by Hate , ” being his twin idols , how could he represent human , far less ethereal love ; and how could he touch those springs of holy tears , which lie deep in man 's heart , and which are connected with all that is dignified , and all that is divine in man 's nature ? What could the author of “ Limberham ” know of love , or the author of “ MacFlecknoe ” of pity ?</p>
   <p>Wordsworth , in that admirable letter to which we have repeatedly referred , says , “ Whenever his language is poetically impassioned , it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects , such as the follies , vices , and crimes of classes of men , or individuals . ” This is unquestionable . He never so nearly reaches the sublime , as when he is expressing contempt . He never rises so high , as in the act of trampling . He is a “ good hater , ” and expresses his hatred with a mixture of animus and ease , of fierceness and of trenchant rapidity , which makes it very formidable . He only , as it were , waves off his adversaries disdainfully , but the very wave of his hand cuts like a sabre . His satire is not savage and furious , like Juvenal 's ; not cool , collected , and infernal , like that of Junius ; not rabid and reckless , like that of Swift ; and never darkens into the unearthly grandeur of Byron 's : but it is strong , swift , dashing , and decisive . Nor does it want deep and subtle touches . His pictures of Shaftesbury and Buckingham are as delicately finished , as they are powerfully conceived . He flies best at the highest game ; but even in dealing with Settles and Shadwells , he can be as felicitous as he is fierce . No satire in the world contains lines more exquisitely inverted , more ingeniously burlesqued , more artfully turned out of their apparently proper course , like rays at once refracted and cooled , than those which thus ominously panegyrise Shadwell :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ His brows thick fogs , instead of glories grace ,</l>
     <l n="2">And lambent dulness play 'd about his face .</l>
     <l n="3">As Hannibal did to the altar come ,</l>
     <l n="4">Sworn by his sire , a mortal foe to Rome ;</l>
     <l n="5">So Shadwell swore , nor should his vow be vain ,</l>
     <l n="6">That he till death true dulness would maintain . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Better still the following picture , in imitation of the Homeric or</l>
     <l n="8">Miltonic manner :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">“ The Sire then shook the honours of his head ,</l>
     <l n="10">And from his brows damps of oblivion shed</l>
     <l n="11">Full on the filial dulness — long he stood</l>
     <l n="12">Repelling from his breast the raging God . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>What inimitable irony in this epithet ! The God of dulness raging ! A stagnant pool in a passion ; a canal insane ; a mouton enragé , as the French says ; or a snail in a tumultuous state of excitement , were but types of the satirical ideas implied in these words . What a description of labouring nonsense — of the Pythonic genius of absurdity , panting and heaving on his solemnly ridiculous tripod !</p>
   <p>The language and versification of Dryden have been praised , and justly . His style is worthy of a still more powerful and original vein of genius than his own . It is a masculine , clear , elastic , and varied diction , fitted to express all feelings , save the deepest ; all fancies , save the subtlest ; all passions , save the loftiest ; all moods of mind , save the most disinterested and rapt ; to represent incidents , however strange ; characters , however contradictory to each other ; shades of meaning , however evasive : and to do all this , as if it were doing nothing , in point of ease , and as if it were doing everything in point of felt and rejoicing energy . No poetic style since can , in such respects , be compared to Dryden 's . Pope 's to his is feeble — and Byron 's forced . He can say the strongest things in the swiftest way , and the most felicitous expressions seem to fall unconsciously from his lips . Had his matter , you say , but been equal to his manner , his thought in originality and imaginative power but commensurate with the boundless quantity , and no less admirable quality , of his words ! His versification deserves a commendation scarcely inferior . It is “ all ear , ” if we may so apply an expression of Shakspeare 's . No studied rules ,— no elaborate complication of harmonies ,— it is the mere sinking and swelling of the wave of his thought as it moves onward to the shore of his purpose . And , as in the sea , there are no furrows absolutely isolated from each other , but each leans on , or melts into each , and the subsidence of the one is the rise of the other — so with the versification of his better poetry . The beginning of the “ Hind and Panther , ” we need not quote ; but it will be remembered , as a good specimen of that peculiar style of running the lines into one another , and thereby producing a certain free and noble effect , which the uniform tinkle of Pope and his school is altogether unable to reach ; a style which has since been copied by some of our poets — by Churchill , by Cowper , and by Shelley . The lines of the artificial school , on the other hand , may be compared to rollers , each distinct from each other ,— each being in itself a whole ,— but altogether forming none . Pope , says Hazlitt , has turned Pegasus into a rocking-horse .</p>
   <p>We are , perhaps , nearly right when we call Dryden the most eloquent and rhetorical of English poets . He bears in this respect an analogy to Lucretius among the Romans , who , inferior in polish to Virgil , was incomparably more animated and energetic in style ; who exhibited , besides , traits of lofty imagination rarely met with in Virgil , and never in Dryden ; and who equalled the English poet in the power of reasoning in verse , and setting the severe abstractions of metaphysical thought to music . With the Shakspeares , Chaucers , Spensers , Miltons , Byrons , Wordsworths , and Coleridges , the Dii majorum gentium of the Poetic Pantheon of Britain , Dryden ranks not , although towering far above the Moores , Goldsmiths , Gays , and Priors . He may be classed with a middle , but still high order , in which we find the names of Scott , as a poet , Johnson , Pope , Cowper , Southey , Crabbe , and two or three others , who , while all excelling Dryden in some qualities , are all excelled by him in others , and bulk on the whole about as largely as he on the public eye .</p>
   <p>We come to make a few remarks , in addition to some we have already incidentally made , on Dryden 's separate works . And first of his Lyrics . His songs , properly so called , are lively , buoyant , and elastic ; yet , compared to those of Shakspeare , they are of “ the earth , earthy . ” They are the down of the thistle , carried on a light breeze upwards . Shakspeare 's resemble aerial notes — snatches of superhuman melody — descending from above . Compared to the warm-gushing songs of Burns , Dryden 's are cold . Better than his songs are his Odes . That on the death of Mrs Killigrew has much divided the opinion of critics — Dr Johnson calling it magnificent , and Warton denying it any merit . We incline to a mediate view . It has bold passages ; the first and the last stanzas are very powerful , and the whole is full of that rushing torrent-movement characteristic of the poet . But the sinkings are as deep as the swellings , and the inequality disturbs the general effect . This is still more true of “ Threnodia Augustalis , ” the ode on the death of Charles II . Not only is its spirit fulsome , and its statement of facts grossly partial , but many of its lines are feeble , and the whole is wire-spun . Yet what can be nobler in thought and language than the following , descriptive of the joy at the king 's partial recovery !—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Men met each other with erected look ,</l>
     <l n="2">The steps were higher that they took ;</l>
     <l n="3">Each to congratulate his friend made haste ,</l>
     <l n="4">And long inveterate foes saluted as they pass 'd . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>How admirably this last line describes that sudden solution of the hostile elements in human nature-that swift sense of unity in society , produced by some glad tidings or great public enthusiasm , when for an hour the Millennium is anticipated , and the poet 's wish , that</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Man wi ’ man , the warld o'er ,</l>
     <l n="2">Shall brithers be , for a ’ that , ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">is fulfilled !</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The two odes on St Cecilia 's Day are both admirable in different ways . “ Alexander 's Feast , ” like Burns 's “ Tam o ’ Shanter , ” seems to come out at once “ as from a mould . ” It is pure inspiration , but of the second order — rather that of the Greek Pythoness than of the Hebrew prophet . Coleridge or Wordsworth makes the objection to it , that the Bacchus it describes is the mere vulgar deity of drink —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Flush 'd with a purple grace ,</l>
     <l n="2">He shows his honest face ” —</l>

   <p>not the ideal Bacchus , clad in vine-leaves , returning from the conquest of India , and attended by a procession of the lions and tigers he had tamed . But this , although a more imaginative representation of the god of wine , had not been so suitably sung at an entertainment presided over by an Alexander and a Thais , a drunk conqueror and a courtezan . Dryden himself , we have seen , thought this the best ode that ever was or would be written in the English language . In a certain sense he was right . For vivacity , freedom of movement , and eloquence , it has never been equalled . But there are some odes — such as Coleridge 's “ Ode to France ” and Wordsworth 's “ Power of Sound ” — which as certainly excel it in strength of imagination , grandeur of conception , and unity of execution and effect .</p>
   <p>Of Dryden 's Satires we have already spoken in a general way . “ Absalom and Achitophel ” is of course the masterpiece , and cannot be too highly praised as a gallery of portraits , and for the daring force and felicity of its style . Why enlarge on a poem , almost every line of which has become a proverb ? “ The Medal ” is inferior only in condensation — in spirit and energy it is quite equal . In “ MacFlecknoe , ” the mock-heroic is sustained with unparalleled vigour from the first line to the last . Shadwell is a favourite of Dryden 's ire . He fancies him , and loves to empty out on his head all the riches of his wrath . What can be more terrible than the words occurring in the second part of “ Absalom and Achitophel ” —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ When wine hath given him courage to blaspheme ,</l>
     <l n="2">He curses God — but God before curst him ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>He has written two pieces , which may be called didactic or controversial poems — “ Religio Laici ” and “ The Hind and Panther . ” The chief power of the former is in its admirable combination of two things , often dissociated — reason and rhyme ; and its chief interest lies in the light it casts upon Dryden 's uncertainty of religious view . The thought has little originality , the versification less varied music than is his wont , and no passage of transcendent power occurs . Far more faulty in plan , and far more unequal , is “ The Hind and Panther ; ” but it has , on the other hand , many passages of amazing eloquence — some satirical pictures equal to anything in “ Absalom and Achitophel ” — some vivid natural descriptions ; and even the absurdities of the fable , and the sophistries of the argument add to its character as the most exquisitely perverted piece of ingenuity in the language . Nothing but high genius , very vigorously exerted , could reconcile us to a story so monstrous , and to reasoning so palpably one-sided and weak .</p>
   <p>His Epistles are of divers merit , but all discover Dryden 's usual sense , sarcastic observation , and sweeping force of style . The best are that to Sir Godfrey Kneller — remarkable for its knowledge of , and graceful tribute to , the “ serene and silent art ” of painting ; and the very noble epistle addressed to Congreve , which reminds you of one giant hand of genius held out to welcome and embrace another . Gross flatterer as Dryden often was , there is something in this epistle that rings true , and the emotion in it you feel even all his powers could never have enabled him to counterfeit . Such generous patronage of rising , by acknowledged merit , was as rare then as it is still . The envy of the literary man too often crowns his gray hairs with a chaplet of nightshade , and pours its dark poison into the latest cup of existence .</p>
   <p>His “ Annus Mirabilis ” is another instance of perverted power , and ingenuity astray . Written in that bad style he found prevalent in his early days — the style of the metaphysical poets , Cowley , Donne , and Drayton — the author ever and anon soars out of his trammels into strong and simple poetry , fervid description , and in one passage — that about the future fortunes of London — into eloquent prophecy . The fire of London is vigorously pictured , but its breath of flame should have burned up petty conceit and tawdry ornament . He should have sternly daguerreotyped the spectacle of the capital of the civilised world burning — a spectacle awful , not only in the sight of men , but , as Hall says of the French Revolution , in that of superior beings . We need not dwell on the far-famed absurdities which the poem contains — about God turning a “ crystal pyramid into a broad extinguisher ” to put out the fire — of the ship compared to a sea-wasp floating on the waves — and of men in the fight killed by “ aromatic splinters ” from the Spice Islands ! Criticism has long ago said its best and its worst about these early escapades of a writer whose taste , to the last , was never commensurate with his genius .</p>
   <p>His Translations we have not included in this edition , as we reserve them , along with other masterpieces of translated verse , for a separate issue afterwards . That of the “ Art of Poetry , ” sometimes included in editions of his works , was not his , but only revised by him . We may say here , in general , however , that although there are more learned and more correct translators than Dryden , there are few who have produced versions so vigorous , so full of exuberant life , and , in those parts of the authors suitable to the peculiarities of the translator 's own genius , so faithful to their spirit and soul , if not to their letter and their body , as he . Parts of Virgil he does not translate well ; he has no sympathy with Maro 's elegance , concinnitas , chaste grandeur , and minute knowledge of nature ; but wherever Virgil begins to glow and gallop , Dryden glows and gallops with him ; and wherever Virgil is nearest Homer , Dryden is nearest him .</p>
   <p>We have reserved to the close his Fables , as , on the whole , forming the culmination of Dryden the artist , if not , perhaps , of Dryden the poet . In preparing his poems for publication , how refreshing we found it to pass from a needful although cursory perusal of his plays , and a revision of his prologues , to these comparatively pure , right-manly , and eloquent compositions — the fables of Dryden ! We do not , because it would be hardly fair , with Wordsworth , seek to compare them with the Chaucerian originals — a comparison under which they would be infallibly crushed . We prefer looking at them as bearing only the relation to Chaucer which Macpherson 's , did to the original , Ossian . And regarding them in this light , as adaptations , where the original author furnishes only the ground-work , they are surely masterpieces and models of composition , if not exemplars of creative power and genius . How free and majestic their numbers ! How bold and buoyant their language ! How interesting the stories they tell ! How perfect the preservation , and artful the presentment , of the various characters ! What a fine chivalrous spirit breathes in “ Palamon and Arcite ! ” What a soft yet purple , pure yet gorgeous , light of love hovers over the “ Flower and the Leaf ! ” — the only poem of Dryden 's in which — thanks perhaps to his master , Chaucer — the poet discovers the slightest perception of that</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Love which spirits feel</l>
     <l n="2">In climes where all is equable and pure . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>What gay and gallant badinage , exquisite irony , and interesting narrative , in the story of “ The Cock and Fox ! ” And what knowledge of human nature and skilful construction in “ The Wife of Bath 's Tale ! ” We are half inclined , with George Ellis , to call these fables the “ noblest specimen of versification to be found in any modern language . ” We gather , too , from them a notion about Dryden 's capabilities , which we may state . It is , that had Dryden lived in a novel and romance-writing age , and turned his great powers in that direction , he might have easily become the best fictionist — next to Cervantes and Scott — that ever lived , possessing , as he did , most of the qualities of a good novelist — vigorous and facile diction ; dramatic skill ; an eye for character ; the power of graphic description , and rapid changeful narrative ; the command of the grave and the gay , the severe and the lively ; and a sympathy both with the bustling activities and the wild romance of human life , if not with its more solemn aspects , its transcendental references , and its aerial heights and giddy abysses of imagination and poetry .</p>
   <p>[ We have followed the judicious example of Warton and Mitford in excluding several Prologues which appear in some editions , but which reflect no honour on their author .</p>
   <p>Dryden 's Translations will be published in the separate series of “ Translations , ” which it is the intention of the Publisher to issue , independent of the “ Poetical Works ” of the various authors . ]</p>

    <head>EPISTLE I .</head>
    <head>TO MY HONOURED FRIEND SIR ROBERT HOWARD ,<span corresp="#note1" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>ON HIS EXCELLENT POEMS .</head>
     <l n="1">As there is music uninform 'd by art</l>
     <l n="2">In those wild notes , which , with a merry heart ,</l>
     <l n="3">The birds in unfrequented shades express ,</l>
     <l n="4">Who , better taught at home , yet please us less :</l>
     <l n="5">So in your verse a native sweetness dwells ,</l>
     <l n="6">Which shames composure , and its art excels .</l>
     <l n="7">Singing no more can your soft numbers grace ,</l>
     <l n="8">Than paint adds charms unto a beauteous face .</l>
     <l n="9">Yet as , when mighty rivers gently creep ,</l>
     <l n="10">Their even calmness does suppose them deep ; 10</l>
     <l n="11">Such is your muse : no metaphor swell 'd high</l>
     <l n="12">With dangerous boldness lifts her to the sky :</l>
     <l n="13">Those mounting fancies , when they fall again ,</l>
     <l n="14">Show sand and dirt at bottom do remain .</l>
     <l n="15">So firm a strength , and yet withal so sweet ,</l>
     <l n="16">Did never but in Samson 's riddle meet .</l>

     <l n="10">While they the victor , he the vanquish 'd chose : 10</l>
     <l n="11">But you have done what Cato could not do ,</l>

     <l n="30">It shoots too fast and high to be express 'd ; 30</l>
     <l n="31">As his heroic worth struck envy dumb ,</l>
     <l n="32">Who took the Dutchman , and who cut the boom .</l>

     <l n="37">Always you warm ; and if the rising year ,</l>

     <l n="11">Till barbarous nations , and more barbarous times ,</l>

     <l n="13">Those rude at first ; a kind of hobbling prose ,</l>

     <l n="15">But Italy , reviving from the trance</l>
     <l n="16">Of Vandal , Goth , and Monkish ignorance ,</l>
     <l n="17">With pauses , cadence , and well-vowell 'd words ,</l>
     <l n="18">And all the graces a good ear affords ,</l>

     <l n="22">What rhyme improved in all its height can be :</l>
     <l n="23">At best a pleasing sound , and fair barbarity .</l>
     <l n="24">The French pursued their steps ; and Britain , last ,</l>
     <l n="25">In manly sweetness all the rest surpass 'd .</l>
     <l n="26">The wit of Greece , the gravity of Rome ,</l>

     <l n="29">In Charles ’ reign , and by Roscommon 's pen .</l>
     <l n="30">Yet modestly he does his work survey , 30</l>
     <l n="31">And calls a finish 'd Poem an Essay ;</l>

     <l n="33">Truth smoothly told , and pleasantly severe ;</l>
     <l n="34">So well is art disguised , for nature to appear .</l>
     <l n="35">Nor need those rules to give translation light :</l>
     <l n="36">His own example is a flame so bright ,</l>
     <l n="37">That he who but arrives to copy well</l>
     <l n="38">Unguided will advance , unknowing will excel .</l>
     <l n="39">Scarce his own Horace could such rules ordain ,</l>
     <l n="40">Or his own Virgil sing a nobler strain . 40</l>
     <l n="41">How much in him may rising Ireland boast —</l>
     <l n="42">How much in gaining him has Britain lost !</l>

     <l n="50">Else must the two contending nations fight ; 50</l>
     <l n="51">A nobler quarrel for his native earth ,</l>
     <l n="52">Than what divided Greece for Homer 's birth .</l>
     <l n="53">To what perfection will our tongue arrive ,</l>
     <l n="54">How will invention and translation thrive ,</l>
     <l n="55">When authors nobly born will bear their part ,</l>
     <l n="56">And not disdain the inglorious praise of art !</l>
     <l n="57">Great generals thus , descending from command ,</l>
     <l n="58">With their own toil provoke the soldier 's hand .</l>

     <l n="60">His fame augmented by an English peer ;<span corresp="#note14" type="note_anchor">[ 14 ]</span>60</l>
     <l n="61">How he embellishes his Helen 's loves ,</l>
     <l n="62">Outdoes his softness , and his sense improves ;</l>
     <l n="63">When these translate , and teach translators too ,</l>
     <l n="64">Nor firstling kid , nor any vulgar vow ,</l>
     <l n="65">Should at Apollo 's grateful altar stand .</l>
     <l n="66">Roscommon writes ; to that auspicious hand ,</l>

     <l n="68">Roscommon , whom both court and camps commend ,</l>
     <l n="69">True to his prince , and faithful to his friend ;</l>
     <l n="70">Roscommon first in fields of honour known , 70</l>
     <l n="71">First in the peaceful triumphs of the gown ;</l>
     <l n="72">Who both Minervas justly makes his own .</l>
     <l n="73">Now let the few beloved by Jove , and they</l>
     <l n="74">Whom infused Titan form 'd of better clay ,</l>

     <l n="12">But what we gain 'd in skill we lost in strength .</l>
     <l n="13">Our builders were with want of genius cursed ;</l>
     <l n="14">The second temple was not like the first :</l>
     <l n="15">Till you , the best Vitruvius , come at length ;</l>
     <l n="16">Our beauties equal , but excel our strength .</l>
     <l n="17">Firm Doric pillars found your solid base :</l>
     <l n="18">The fair Corinthian crowns the higher space :</l>
     <l n="19">Thus all below is strength , and all above is grace .</l>
     <l n="20">In easy dialogue is Fletcher 's praise ; 20</l>
     <l n="21">He moved the mind , but had not power to raise .</l>
     <l n="22">Great Jonson did by strength of judgment please ;</l>
     <l n="23">Yet , doubling Fletcher 's force , he wants his ease .</l>
     <l n="24">In differing talents both adorn 'd their age ;</l>
     <l n="25">One for the study , the other for the stage .</l>
     <l n="26">But both to Congreve justly shall submit —</l>
     <l n="27">One match 'd in judgment , both o'ermatch ' d in wit .</l>
     <l n="28">In him all beauties of this age we see ,</l>
     <l n="29">Etherege 's courtship , Southerne 's purity ,</l>
     <l n="30">The satire , wit , and strength of manly Wycherly . 30</l>
     <l n="31">All this in blooming youth you have achieved :</l>
     <l n="32">Nor are your foil 'd contemporaries grieved .</l>
     <l n="33">So much the sweetness of your manners move ,</l>
     <l n="34">We cannot envy you , because we love .</l>
     <l n="35">Fabius might joy in Scipio , when he saw</l>
     <l n="36">A beardless consul made against the law ,</l>
     <l n="37">And join his suffrage to the votes of Rome ;</l>
     <l n="38">Though he with Hannibal was overcome .</l>
     <l n="39">Thus old Romano bow 'd to Raphael 's fame ,</l>

    <head>TO MR GRANVILLE ,<span corresp="#note20" type="note_anchor">[ 20 ]</span>ON HIS EXCELLENT TRAGEDY CALLED “ HEROIC LOVE . ”</head>
     <l n="1">Auspicious poet , wert thou not my friend ,</l>
     <l n="2">How could I envy , what I must commend !</l>
     <l n="3">But since ‘ tis nature 's law , in love and wit ,</l>
     <l n="4">That youth should reign , and withering age submit ,</l>
     <l n="5">With less regret those laurels I resign ,</l>
     <l n="6">Which , dying on my brows , revive on thine .</l>
     <l n="7">With better grace an ancient chief may yield</l>
     <l n="8">The long-contended honours of the field ,</l>
     <l n="9">Than venture all his fortune at a cast ,</l>
     <l n="10">And fight , like Hannibal , to lose at last . 10</l>
     <l n="11">Young princes , obstinate to win the prize ,</l>
     <l n="12">Though yearly beaten , yearly yet they rise :</l>
     <l n="13">Old monarchs , though successful , still in doubt ,</l>
     <l n="14">Catch at a peace , and wisely turn devout .</l>
     <l n="15">Thine be the laurel , then ; thy blooming age</l>
     <l n="16">Can best , if any can , support the stage ;</l>
     <l n="17">Which so declines , that shortly we may see</l>
     <l n="18">Players and plays reduced to second infancy .</l>
     <l n="19">Sharp to the world , but thoughtless of renown ,</l>
     <l n="20">They plot not on the stage , but on the town , 20</l>
     <l n="21">And , in despair , their empty pit to fill ,</l>
     <l n="22">Set up some foreign monster in a bill .</l>
     <l n="23">Thus they jog on , still tricking , never thriving ,</l>
     <l n="24">And murdering plays , which they miscall reviving .</l>
     <l n="25">Our sense is nonsense , through their pipes convey 'd :</l>
     <l n="26">Scarce can a poet know the play he made ;</l>
     <l n="27">‘ Tis so disguised in death ; nor thinks ‘ tis he</l>
     <l n="28">That suffers in the mangled tragedy .</l>
     <l n="29">Thus Itys first was kill 'd , and after dress 'd</l>
     <l n="30">For his own sire , the chief invited guest . 30</l>
     <l n="31">I say not this of thy successful scenes ,</l>
     <l n="32">Where thine was all the glory , theirs the gains .</l>
     <l n="33">With length of time , much judgment , and more toil ,</l>
     <l n="34">Not ill they acted , what they could not spoil .</l>
     <l n="35">Their setting sun<span corresp="#note21" type="note_anchor">[ 21 ]</span>still shoots a glimmering ray ,</l>
     <l n="36">Like ancient Rome majestic in decay :</l>
     <l n="37">And better gleanings their worn soil can boast ,</l>
     <l n="38">Than the crab-vintage of the neighbouring coast .<span corresp="#note22" type="note_anchor">[ 22 ]</span></l>

    <p>TO MY FRIEND MR MOTTEUX ,<span corresp="#note23" type="note_anchor">[ 23 ]</span>ON HIS TRAGEDY CALLED “ BEAUTY IN DISTRESS . ”</p>
     <l n="1">‘ Tis hard , my friend , to write in such an age ,</l>
     <l n="2">As damns , not only poets , but the stage .</l>
     <l n="3">That sacred art , by Heaven itself infused ,</l>
     <l n="4">Which Moses , David , Solomon have used ,</l>
     <l n="5">Is now to be no more : the Muses ’ foes</l>
     <l n="6">Would sink their Maker 's praises into prose .</l>
     <l n="7">Were they content to prune the lavish vine</l>
     <l n="8">Of straggling branches , and improve the wine ,</l>
     <l n="9">Who but a madman would his thoughts defend ?</l>
     <l n="10">All would submit ; for all but fools will mend . 10</l>
     <l n="11">But when to common sense they give the lie ,</l>
     <l n="12">And turn distorted words to blasphemy ,</l>
     <l n="13">They give the scandal ; and the wise discern ,</l>
     <l n="14">Their glosses teach an age , too apt to learn .</l>
     <l n="15">What I have loosely , or profanely , writ ,</l>
     <l n="16">Let them to fires , their due desert , commit :</l>
     <l n="17">Nor , when accused by me , let them complain :</l>
     <l n="18">Their faults , and not their function , I arraign .</l>
     <l n="19">Rebellion , worse than witchcraft , they pursued ;</l>
     <l n="20">The pulpit preach 'd the crime , the people rued . 20</l>
     <l n="21">The stage was silenced ; for the saints would see</l>
     <l n="22">In fields perform 'd their plotted tragedy .</l>
     <l n="23">But let us first reform , and then so live ,</l>
     <l n="24">That we may teach our teachers to forgive :</l>
     <l n="25">Our desk be placed below their lofty chairs ;</l>
     <l n="26">Ours be the practice , as the precept theirs .</l>
     <l n="27">The moral part , at least , we may divide ,</l>
     <l n="28">Humility reward , and punish pride ;</l>
     <l n="29">Ambition , interest , avarice , accuse :</l>
     <l n="30">These are the province of a tragic Muse . 30</l>
     <l n="31">These hast thou chosen ; and the public voice</l>
     <l n="32">Has equall 'd thy performance with thy choice .</l>
     <l n="33">Time , action , place , are so preserved by thee ,</l>
     <l n="34">That even Cornëille might with envy see</l>
     <l n="35">The alliance of his tripled Unity .</l>
     <l n="36">Thy incidents , perhaps , too thick are sown ;</l>
     <l n="37">But too much plenty is thy fault alone .</l>
     <l n="38">At least but two can that good crime commit ,</l>
     <l n="39">Thou in design , and Wycherly in wit .</l>
     <l n="40">Let thy own Gauls condemn thee , if they dare ; 40</l>
     <l n="41">Contented to be thinly regular :</l>
     <l n="42">Born there , but not for them , our fruitful soil</l>
     <l n="43">With more increase rewards thy happy toil .</l>
     <l n="44">Their tongue , enfeebled , is refined too much ;</l>
     <l n="45">And , like pure gold , it bends at every touch :</l>
     <l n="46">Our sturdy Teuton yet will art obey ,</l>
     <l n="47">More fit for manly thought , and strengthen 'd with allay .</l>
     <l n="48">But whence art thou inspired , and thou alone ,</l>
     <l n="49">To flourish in an idiom not thy own ?</l>
     <l n="50">It moves our wonder , that a foreign guest 50</l>
     <l n="51">Should over-match the most , and match the best .</l>
     <l n="52">In under-praising thy deserts , I wrong ;</l>
     <l n="53">Here find the first deficience of our tongue :</l>
     <l n="54">Words , once my stock , are wanting , to commend</l>

     <l n="13">It might ( what nature never gives the young )</l>

     <l n="15">But satire needs not those , and wit will shine</l>
     <l n="16">Through the harsh cadence of a rugged line .</l>
     <l n="17">A noble error , and but seldom made ,</l>
     <l n="18">When poets are by too much force betray 'd .</l>
     <l n="19">Thy generous fruits , though gather 'd ere their prime ,</l>
     <l n="20">Still show 'd a quickness ; and maturing time 20</l>
     <l n="21">But mellows what we write , to the dull sweets of rhyme .</l>
     <l n="22">Once more , hail ! and farewell , farewell , thou young ,</l>
     <l n="23">But , ah ! too short , Marcellus of our tongue !</l>
     <l n="24">Thy brows with ivy , and with laurels bound ;</l>

     <l n="1">A PANEGYRICAL POEM , DEDICATED TO THE MEMORY OF THE LATE COUNTESS OF</l>
     <l n="2">ABINGDON .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE EARL OF ABINGDON , &amp; c .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>MY LORD ,— The commands , with which you honoured me some months ago , are now performed : they had been sooner ; but betwixt ill health , some business , and many troubles , I was forced to defer them till this time . Ovid , going to his banishment , and writing from on shipboard to his friends , excused the faults of his poetry by his misfortunes ; and told them , that good verses never flow but from a serene and composed spirit . Wit , which is a kind of Mercury , with wings fastened to his head and heels , can fly but slowly in a damp air . I therefore chose rather to obey you late than ill : if at least I am capable of writing anything , at any time , which is worthy your perusal and your patronage . I cannot say that I have escaped from a shipwreck ; but have only gained a rock by hard swimming , where I may pant a while and gather breath : for the doctors give me a sad assurance , that my disease never took its leave of any man , but with a purpose to return . However , my lord , I have laid hold on the interval , and managed the small stock , which age has left me , to the best advantage , in performing this inconsiderable service to my lady 's memory . We , who are priests of Apollo , have not the inspiration when we please ; but must wait until the god comes rushing on us , and invades us with a fury which we are not able to resist : which gives us double strength while the fit continues , and leaves us languishing and spent at its departure . Let me not seem to boast , my lord , for I have really felt it on this occasion , and prophesied beyond my natural power . Let me add , and hope to be believed , that the excellency of the subject contributed much to the happiness of the execution ; and that the weight of thirty years was taken off me while I was writing . I swam with the tide , and the water under me was buoyant . The reader will easily observe that I was transported by the multitude and variety of my similitudes ; which are generally the product of a luxuriant fancy , and the wantonness of wit . Had I called in my judgment to my assistance , I had certainly retrenched many of them . But I defend them not ; let them pass for beautiful faults amongst the better sort of critics : for the whole poem , though written in that which they call Heroic verse , is of the Pindaric nature , as well in the thought as the expression ; and , as such , requires the same grains of allowance for it . It was intended , as your lordship sees in the title , not for an elegy , but a panegyric : a kind of apotheosis , indeed , if a heathen word may be applied to a Christian use . And on all occasions of praise , if we take the ancients for our patterns , we are bound by prescription to employ the magnificence of words , and the force of figures , to adorn the sublimity of thoughts . Isocrates amongst the Grecian orators , and Cicero , and the younger Pliny , amongst the Romans , have left us their precedents for our security ; for I think I need not mention the inimitable Pindar , who stretches on these pinions out of sight , and is carried upward , as it were , into another world .</p>
   <p>This , at least , my lord , I may justly plead , that if I have not performed so well as I think I have , yet I have used my best endeavours to excel myself . One disadvantage I have had ; which is , never to have known or seen my lady : and to draw the lineaments of her mind , from the description which I have received from others , is for a painter to set himself at work without the living original before him : which , the more beautiful it is , will be so much the more difficult for him to conceive , when he has only a relation given him of such and such features by an acquaintance or a friend , without the nice touches , which give the best resemblance , and make the graces of the picture . Every artist is apt enough to flatter himself ( and I amongst the rest ) that their own ocular observations would have discovered more perfections , at least others , than have been delivered to them : though I have received mine from the best hands , that is , from persons who neither want a just understanding of my lady 's worth , nor a due veneration for her memory .</p>
   <p>Dr Donne , the greatest wit , though not the greatest poet of our nation , acknowledges , that he had never seen Mrs Drury , whom he has made immortal in his admirable “ Anniversaries . ” I have had the same fortune , though I have not succeeded to the same genius . However , I have followed his footsteps in the design of his panegyric ; which was to raise an emulation in the living , to copy out the example of the dead . And therefore it was , that I once intended to have called this poem “ The Pattern : ” and though , on a second consideration , I changed the title into the name of the illustrious person , yet the design continues , and Eleonora is still the pattern of charity , devotion , and humility ; of the best wife , the best mother , and the best of friends .</p>
   <p>And now , my lord , though I have endeavoured to answer your commands ; yet I could not answer it to the world , nor to my conscience , if I gave not your lordship my testimony of being the best husband now living : I say my testimony only ; for the praise of it is given you by yourself . They who despise the rules of virtue both in their practice and their morals , will think this a very trivial commendation . But I think it the peculiar happiness of the Countess of Abingdon to have been so truly loved by you while she was living , and so gratefully honoured after she was dead . Few there are who have either had , or could have , such a loss ; and yet fewer who carried their love and constancy beyond the grave . The exteriors of mourning , a decent funeral , and black habits , are the usual stints of common husbands : and perhaps their wives deserve no better than to be mourned with hypocrisy , and forgot with ease . But you have distinguished yourself from ordinary lovers , by a real and lasting grief for the deceased ; and by endeavouring to raise for her the most durable monument , which is that of verse . And so it would have proved , if the workman had been equal to the work , and your choice of the artificer as happy as your design . Yet , as Phidias , when he had made the statue of Minerva , could not forbear to engrave his own name , as author of the piece : so give me leave to hope , that , by subscribing mine to this poem , I may live by the goddess , and transmit my name to posterity by the memory of hers . It is no flattery to assure your lordship , that she is remembered , in the present age , by all who have had the honour of her conversation and acquaintance ; and that I have never been in any company since the news of her death was first brought me , where they have not extolled her virtues , and even spoken the same things of her in prose , which I have done in verse .</p>
   <p>I therefore think myself obliged to thank your lordship for the commission which you have given me : how I have acquitted myself of it , must be left to the opinion of the world , in spite of any protestation which I can enter against the present age , as incompetent or corrupt judges . For my comfort , they are but Englishmen , and , as such , if they think ill of me to-day , they are inconstant enough to think well of me to-morrow . And after all , I have not much to thank my fortune that I was born amongst them . The good of both sexes are so few , in England , that they stand like exceptions against general rules : and though one of them has deserved a greater commendation than I could give her , they have taken care that I should not tire my pen with frequent exercise on the like subjects ; that praises , like taxes , should be appropriated , and left almost as individual as the person . They say , my talent is satire : if it be so , it is a fruitful age , and there is an extraordinary crop to gather . But a single hand is insufficient for such a harvest : they have sown the dragons ’ teeth themselves , and it is but just they should reap each other in lampoons . You , my lord , who have the character of honour , though it is not my happiness to know you , may stand aside , with the small remainders of the English nobility , truly such , and , unhurt yourselves , behold the mad combat . If I have pleased you and some few others , I have obtained my end . You see I have disabled myself , like an elected speaker of the house : yet like him I have undertaken the charge , and find the burden sufficiently recompensed by the honour . Be pleased to accept of these my unworthy labours , this paper-monument ; and let her pious memory , which I am sure is sacred to you , not only plead the pardon of my many faults , but gain me your protection , which is ambitiously sought by , my lord , your lordship 's most obedient servant ,</p>

     <l n="17">Secure of bread , as of returning light ;</l>

     <l n="28">Nor did her alms from ostentation fall ,</l>

     <l n="59">In its best work of mercy , think it there :</l>
     <l n="60">Where all the deeds of charity and love 60</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="65">Yet was she not profuse ; but feared to waste ,</l>

     <l n="68">When crowds appear 'd , she had not to relieve :</l>
     <l n="69">Which to prevent , she still increased her store ;</l>
     <l n="70">Laid up , and spared , that she might give the more . 70</l>

     <l n="73">Taught from above his magazines to frame ,</l>
     <l n="74">That famine was prevented ere it came .</l>
     <l n="75">Thus Heaven , though all-sufficient , shows a thrift</l>
     <l n="76">In His economy , and bounds His gift :</l>
     <l n="77">Creating , for our day , one single light ;</l>
     <l n="78">And his reflection , too , supplies the night .</l>

    <p>ON THE DEATH OF AMYNTAS .</p>
    <p>A PASTORAL ELEGY .</p>
     <l n="1">‘ Twas on a joyless and a gloomy morn ,</l>
     <l n="2">Wet was the grass , and hung with pearls the thorn ;</l>
     <l n="3">When Damon , who design 'd to pass the day</l>
     <l n="4">With hounds and horns , and chase the flying prey ,</l>
     <l n="5">Rose early from his bed ; but soon he found</l>
     <l n="6">The welkin pitch 'd with sullen clouds around ,</l>
     <l n="7">An eastern wind , and dew upon the ground .</l>
     <l n="8">Thus while he stood , and , sighing , did survey</l>
     <l n="9">The fields , and cursed the ill omens of the day ,</l>
     <l n="10">He saw Menalcas come with heavy pace ; 10</l>
     <l n="11">Wet were his eyes , and cheerless was his face :</l>
     <l n="12">He wrung his hands , distracted with his care ,</l>
     <l n="13">And sent his voice before him from afar .</l>
     <l n="14">Return , he cried , return , unhappy swain !</l>
     <l n="15">The spungy clouds are fill 'd with gathering rain :</l>
     <l n="16">The promise of the day not only cross 'd ,</l>
     <l n="17">But even the spring , the spring itself is lost .</l>
     <l n="18">Amyntas — oh !— he could not speak the rest ,</l>
     <l n="19">Nor needed , for presaging Damon guess 'd .</l>
     <l n="20">Equal with heaven young Damon loved the boy , 20</l>
     <l n="21">The boast of nature , both his parents ’ joy ,</l>
     <l n="22">His graceful form revolving in his mind ;</l>
     <l n="23">So great a genius , and a soul so kind ,</l>
     <l n="24">Gave sad assurance that his fears were true ;</l>
     <l n="25">Too well the envy of the gods he knew :</l>
     <l n="26">For when their gifts too lavishly are placed ,</l>
     <l n="27">Soon they repent , and will not make them last .</l>
     <l n="28">For sure it was too bountiful a dole ,</l>
     <l n="29">The mother 's features , and the father 's soul .</l>
     <l n="30">Then thus he cried ; the morn bespoke the news : 30</l>
     <l n="31">The morning did her cheerful light diffuse :</l>
     <l n="32">But see how suddenly she changed her face ,</l>
     <l n="33">And brought on clouds and rain , the day 's disgrace !</l>
     <l n="34">Just such , Amyntas , was thy promised race :</l>
     <l n="35">What charms adorn 'd thy youth , where nature smiled ,</l>
     <l n="36">And more than man was given us in a child !</l>
     <l n="37">His infancy was ripe : a soul sublime</l>
     <l n="38">In years so tender that prevented time :</l>
     <l n="39">Heaven gave him all at once ; then snatch 'd away ,</l>
     <l n="40">Ere mortals all his beauties could survey : 40</l>
     <l n="41">Just like the flower that buds and withers in a day .</l>

     <l n="4">One groan was heard , one universal sound :</l>
     <l n="5">All were in floods of tears and endless sorrow drown 'd .</l>
     <l n="6">So dire a sadness sat on every look ,</l>
     <l n="7">Even Death repented he had given the stroke .</l>
     <l n="8">He grieved his fatal work had been ordain 'd</l>
     <l n="9">But promised length of life to those who yet remain 'd . 50</l>
     <l n="10">The mother 's and her eldest daughter 's grace ,</l>
     <l n="11">It seems , had bribed him to prolong their space .</l>
     <l n="12">The father bore it with undaunted soul ,</l>
     <l n="13">Like one who durst his destiny control :</l>
     <l n="14">Yet with becoming grief he bore his part ,</l>
     <l n="15">Resign 'd his son , but not resign 'd his heart :</l>

    <head>ON THE DEATH OF A VERY YOUNG GENTLEMAN .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">He who could view the book of destiny ,</l>
     <l n="2">And read whatever there was writ of thee ,</l>
     <l n="3">O charming youth , in the first opening page ,</l>
     <l n="4">So many graces in so green an age ,</l>
     <l n="5">Such wit , such modesty , such strength of mind ,</l>
     <l n="6">A soul at once so manly and so kind ;</l>
     <l n="7">Would wonder , when he turn 'd the volume o'er ,</l>
     <l n="8">And after some few leaves should find no more ,</l>
     <l n="9">Nought but a blank remain , a dead void space ,</l>
     <l n="10">A step of life that promised such a race . 10</l>
     <l n="11">We must not , dare not think , that Heaven began</l>
     <l n="12">A child , and could not finish him a man ;</l>
     <l n="13">Reflecting what a mighty store was laid</l>
     <l n="14">Of rich materials , and a model made :</l>
     <l n="15">The cost already furnish 'd ; so bestow 'd ,</l>
     <l n="16">As more was never to one soul allow 'd :</l>
     <l n="17">Yet after this profusion spent in vain ,</l>
     <l n="18">Nothing but mouldering ashes to remain ,</l>
     <l n="19">I guess not , lest I split upon the shelf ,</l>
     <l n="20">Yet durst I guess , Heaven kept it for himself ; 20</l>
     <l n="21">And giving us the use , did soon recall ,</l>
     <l n="22">Ere we could spare , the mighty principal .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="23">Thus then he disappeared , was rarified ;</l>
     <l n="24">For ‘ tis improper speech to say he died :</l>
     <l n="25">He was exhaled ; his great Creator drew</l>
     <l n="26">His spirit , as the sun the morning dew .</l>
     <l n="27">‘ Tis sin produces death ; and he had none ,</l>
     <l n="28">But the taint Adam left on every son .</l>
     <l n="29">He added not , he was so pure , so good ,</l>
     <l n="30">‘ Twas but the original forfeit of his blood : 30</l>
     <l n="31">And that so little , that the river ran</l>
     <l n="32">More clear than the corrupted fount began .</l>
     <l n="33">Nothing remain 'd of the first muddy clay ;</l>
     <l n="34">The length of course had wash 'd it in the way :</l>
     <l n="35">So deep , and yet so clear , we might behold</l>
     <l n="36">The gravel bottom , and that bottom gold .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="37">As such we loved , admired , almost adored ,</l>
     <l n="38">Gave all the tribute mortals could afford .</l>
     <l n="39">Perhaps we gave so much , the powers above</l>
     <l n="40">Grew angry at our superstitious love : 40</l>
     <l n="41">For when we more than human homage pay ,</l>
     <l n="42">The charming cause is justly snatch 'd away .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="43">Thus was the crime not his , but ours alone :</l>
     <l n="44">And yet we murmur that he went so soon ;</l>
     <l n="45">Though miracles are short and rarely shown .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="46">Learn , then , ye mournful parents , and divide</l>
     <l n="47">That love in many , which in one was tied .</l>
     <l n="48">That individual blessing is no more ,</l>
     <l n="49">But multiplied in your remaining store .</l>
     <l n="50">The flame 's dispersed , but does not all expire ; 50</l>
     <l n="51">The sparkles blaze , though not the globe of fire .</l>
     <l n="52">Love him by parts , in all your numerous race ,</l>
     <l n="53">And from those parts form one collected grace :</l>
     <l n="54">Then , when you have refined to that degree ,</l>
     <l n="55">Imagine all in one , and think that one is he .</l>

      <l n="9">Such were the features of her heavenly face ,</l>

      <l n="29">And read her Maker in a fairer print .</l>
      <l n="30">So pious , as she had no time to spare</l>
      <l n="31">For human thoughts , but was confined to prayer .</l>
      <l n="32">Yet in such charities she pass 'd the day , 30</l>
      <l n="33">‘ Twas wondrous how she found an hour to pray .</l>
      <l n="34">A soul so calm , it knew not ebbs or flows ,</l>

     <l n="2">In vain I have loved you , and hope no relief ;</l>
     <l n="3">Undone by your virtue , too strict and severe ,</l>
     <l n="4">Your eyes gave me love , and you gave me despair ;</l>
     <l n="5">Now call 'd by my honour , I seek with content</l>
     <l n="6">The fate which in pity you would not prevent :</l>
     <l n="7">To languish in love , were to find by delay</l>
     <l n="8">A death that 's more welcome the speediest way .</l>
     <l n="9">On seas and in battles , in bullets and fire ,</l>
     <l n="10">The danger is less than in hopeless desire ; 10</l>
     <l n="11">My death'shYpppHeNwound you give , though far off I bear</l>
     <l n="12">My fall from your sight — not to cost you a tear :</l>
     <l n="13">But if the kind flood on a wave should convey ,</l>
     <l n="14">And under your window my body should lay ,</l>
     <l n="15">The wound on my breast when you happen to see ,</l>
     <l n="16">You 'll say with a sigh — it was given by me .</l>

     <l n="1">As when a tree 's cut down , the secret root</l>

     <l n="3">So from old Shakspeare 's honour 'd dust , this day</l>
     <l n="4">Springs up and buds a new reviving play :</l>
     <l n="5">Shakspeare , who ( taught by none ) did first impart</l>
     <l n="6">To Fletcher wit , to labouring Jonson art .</l>
     <l n="7">He , monarch like , gave those , his subjects , law ;</l>
     <l n="8">And is that nature which they paint and draw .</l>
     <l n="9">Fletcher reach 'd that which on his heights did grow ,</l>
     <l n="10">While Jonson crept , and gather 'd all below . 10</l>
     <l n="11">This did his love , and this his mirth digest :</l>
     <l n="12">One imitates him most , the other best .</l>

     <l n="15">The storm , which vanish 'd on the neighbouring shore ,</l>
     <l n="16">Was taught by Shakspeare 's Tempest first to roar .</l>
     <l n="17">That innocence and beauty , which did smile</l>
     <l n="18">In Fletcher , grew on this enchanted isle .</l>
     <l n="19">But Shakspeare 's magic could not copied be ;</l>
     <l n="20">Within that circle none durst walk but he . 20</l>
     <l n="21">I must confess ‘ twas bold , nor would you now</l>
     <l n="22">That liberty to vulgar wits allow ,</l>
     <l n="23">Which works by magic supernatural things :</l>
     <l n="24">But Shakspeare 's power is sacred as a king 's .</l>
     <l n="25">Those legends from old priesthood were received ,</l>
     <l n="26">And he then writ , as people then believed .</l>
     <l n="27">But if for Shakspeare we your grace implore ,</l>
     <l n="28">We for our theatre shall want it more :</l>
     <l n="29">Who , by our dearth of youths , are forced to employ</l>
     <l n="30">One of our women to present a boy ; 30</l>
     <l n="31">And that 's a transformation , you will say ,</l>
     <l n="32">Exceeding all the magic in the play .</l>
     <l n="33">Let none expect in the last act to find ,</l>
     <l n="34">Her sex transform 'd from man to womankind .</l>
     <l n="35">Whate'er she was before the play began ,</l>
     <l n="36">All you shall see of her is perfect man .</l>

     <l n="7">Therefore our poet , as he thinks not fit</l>
     <l n="8">To impose upon you what he writes for wit ;</l>
     <l n="9">So hopes , that , leaving you your censures free ,</l>
     <l n="10">You equal judges of the whole will be : 10</l>
     <l n="11">They judge but half , who only faults will see .</l>

     <l n="18">But when a tyrant for his theme he had ,</l>
     <l n="19">He loosed the reins , and bid his muse run mad :</l>
     <l n="20">And though he stumbles in a full career , 20</l>
     <l n="21">Yet rashness is a better fault than fear .</l>
     <l n="22">He saw his way ; but in so swift a pace ,</l>
     <l n="23">To choose the ground might be to lose the race .</l>

     <l n="13">But , in your diet , you grow savages :</l>
     <l n="14">Nothing but human flesh your taste can please ;</l>
     <l n="15">And , as their feasts with slaughter 'd slaves began ,</l>

     <l n="19">But fools grow wary now : and , when they see</l>
     <l n="20">A poet eyeing round the company , 20</l>
     <l n="21">Straight each man for himself begins to doubt ;</l>
     <l n="22">They shrink like seamen when a press comes out .</l>
     <l n="23">Few of them will be found for public use ,</l>
     <l n="24">Except you charge an oaf upon each house ,</l>
     <l n="25">Like the train bands , and every man engage</l>
     <l n="26">For a sufficient fool , to serve the stage ,</l>
     <l n="27">And when , with much ado , you get him there ,</l>
     <l n="28">Where he in all his glory should appear .</l>
     <l n="29">Your poets make him such rare things to say ,</l>
     <l n="30">That he 's more wit than any man i ’ th ’ play : 30</l>
     <l n="31">But of so ill a mingle with the rest ,</l>
     <l n="32">As when a parrot 's taught to break a jest .</l>
     <l n="33">Thus , aiming to be fine , they make a show ,</l>
     <l n="34">As tawdry squires in country churches do .</l>
     <l n="35">Things well consider 'd , ‘ tis so hard to make</l>
     <l n="36">A comedy , which should the knowing take ,</l>
     <l n="37">That our dull poet , in despair to please ,</l>
     <l n="38">Does humbly beg , by me , his writ of ease .</l>
     <l n="39">‘ Tis a land-tax , which he 's too poor to pay ;</l>
     <l n="40">You therefore must some other impost lay . 40</l>
     <l n="41">Would you but change , for serious plot and verse ,</l>
     <l n="42">This motley garniture of fool and farce ,</l>
     <l n="43">Nor scorn a mode , because ‘ tis taught at home ,</l>
     <l n="44">Which does , like vests , our gravity become ,</l>
     <l n="45">Our poet yields you should this play refuse :</l>
     <l n="46">As tradesmen , by the change of fashions , lose ,</l>
     <l n="47">With some content , their fripperies of France ,</l>
     <l n="48">In hope it may their staple trade advance .</l>

     <l n="1">They who have best succeeded on the stage ,</l>
     <l n="2">Have still conform 'd their genius to their age .</l>
     <l n="3">Thus Jonson did mechanic humour show ,</l>
     <l n="4">When men were dull , and conversation low .</l>
     <l n="5">Then comedy was faultless , but ‘ twas coarse :</l>
     <l n="6">Cobb 's tankard was a jest , and Otter 's horse .</l>
     <l n="7">And , as their comedy , their love was mean ;</l>
     <l n="8">Except , by chance , in some one labour 'd scene ,</l>
     <l n="9">Which must atone for an ill-written play .</l>
     <l n="10">They rose , but at their height could seldom stay . 10</l>
     <l n="11">Fame then was cheap , and the first comer sped ;</l>
     <l n="12">And they have kept it since , by being dead .</l>
     <l n="13">But , were they now to write , when critics weigh</l>
     <l n="14">Each line , and every word , throughout a play ,</l>
     <l n="15">None of them , no not Jonson in his height ,</l>
     <l n="16">Could pass , without allowing grains for weight .</l>
     <l n="17">Think it not envy , that these truths are told :</l>
     <l n="18">Our poet 's not malicious , though he 's bold .</l>
     <l n="19">‘ Tis not to brand them , that their faults are shown ,</l>
     <l n="20">But , by their errors , to excuse his own . 20</l>
     <l n="21">If love and honour now are higher raised ,</l>
     <l n="22">‘ Tis not the poet , but the age is praised .</l>

     <l n="24">Our native language more refined and free .</l>
     <l n="25">Our ladies and our men now speak more wit</l>
     <l n="26">In conversation , than those poets writ .</l>
     <l n="27">Then , one of these is , consequently , true :</l>
     <l n="28">That what this poet writes comes short of you ,</l>
     <l n="29">And imitates you ill ( which most he fears ) ,</l>
     <l n="30">Or else his writing is not worse than theirs . 30</l>

     <l n="5">You , who each day can theatres behold ,</l>
     <l n="6">Like Nero 's palace , shining all with gold ,</l>

     <l n="8">And , for the homely room , disdain the cheer .</l>

     <l n="10">And a plain suit , since we can make but one , 10</l>

     <l n="18">We yield in both , and only beg to live :</l>
     <l n="19">Unable to support their vast expense ,</l>
     <l n="20">Who build and treat with such magnificence ; 20</l>
     <l n="21">That , like the ambitious monarchs of the age ,</l>

     <l n="1">Our author , by experience , finds it true ,</l>
     <l n="2">‘ Tis much more hard to please himself than you ;</l>
     <l n="3">And out of no feign 'd modesty , this day</l>
     <l n="4">Damns his laborious trifle of a play ;</l>
     <l n="5">Not that it 's worse than what before he writ ,</l>
     <l n="6">But he has now another taste of wit ;</l>
     <l n="7">And , to confess a truth , though out of time ,</l>
     <l n="8">Grows weary of his long-loved mistress , Rhyme .</l>
     <l n="9">Passion 's too fierce to be in fetters bound ,</l>
     <l n="10">And nature flies him like enchanted ground : 10</l>
     <l n="11">What verse can do , he has perform 'd in this ,</l>
     <l n="12">Which he presumes the most correct of his ;</l>
     <l n="13">But spite of all his pride , a secret shame</l>
     <l n="14">Invades his breast at Shakspeare 's sacred name :</l>
     <l n="15">Awed when he hears his godlike Romans rage ,</l>
     <l n="16">He , in a just despair , would quit the stage ;</l>
     <l n="17">And to an age less polish 'd , more unskill 'd ,</l>
     <l n="18">Does , with disdain , the foremost honours yield .</l>
     <l n="19">As with the greater dead he dares not strive ,</l>
     <l n="20">He would not match his verse with those who live : 20</l>
     <l n="21">Let him retire , betwixt two ages cast ,</l>
     <l n="22">The first of this , and hindmost of the last .</l>
     <l n="23">A losing gamester , let him sneak away ;</l>
     <l n="24">He bears no ready money from the play .</l>
     <l n="25">The fate which governs poets , thought it fit</l>
     <l n="26">He should not raise his fortunes by his wit .</l>
     <l n="27">The clergy thrive , and the litigious bar ;</l>
     <l n="28">Dull heroes fatten with the spoils of war :</l>
     <l n="29">All southern vices , heaven be praised , are here ;</l>
     <l n="30">But wit 's a luxury you think too dear . 30</l>
     <l n="31">When you to cultivate the plant are loth ,</l>
     <l n="32">‘ Tis a shrewd sign , ‘ twas never of your growth ;</l>
     <l n="33">And wit in northern climates will not blow ,</l>
     <l n="34">Except , like orange trees , ‘ tis housed with snow .</l>
     <l n="35">There needs no care to put a playhouse down ,</l>
     <l n="36">‘ Tis the most desert place of all the town :</l>
     <l n="37">We , and our neighbours , to speak proudly , are ,</l>
     <l n="38">Like monarchs , ruin 'd with expensive war ;</l>
     <l n="39">While , likewise English , unconcern 'd you sit ,</l>
     <l n="40">And see us play the tragedy of wit . 40</l>

    <p>EPILOGUE TO “ THE MAN OF MODE ; OR , SIR FOPLING FLUTTER ; ”</p>
    <p>BY SIR GEORGE ETHEREGE , 1676 .</p>
     <l n="1">Most modern wits such monstrous fools have shown ,</l>
     <l n="2">They seem not of Heaven 's making , but their own .</l>
     <l n="3">Those nauseous harlequins in farce may pass ;</l>
     <l n="4">But there goes more to a substantial ass :</l>
     <l n="5">Something of man must be exposed to view ,</l>
     <l n="6">That , gallants , they may more resemble you .</l>
     <l n="7">Sir Fopling is a fool so nicely writ ,</l>
     <l n="8">The ladies would mistake him for a wit ;</l>
     <l n="9">And , when he sings , talks loud , and cocks , would cry ,</l>
     <l n="10">I vow , methinks , he 's pretty company : 10</l>
     <l n="11">So brisk , so gay , so travell 'd , so refined ,</l>
     <l n="12">As he took pains to graff upon his kind .</l>
     <l n="13">True fops help nature 's work , and go to school</l>
     <l n="14">To file and finish God Almighty 's fool .</l>
     <l n="15">Yet none Sir Fopling him , or him can call ;</l>
     <l n="16">He 's knight o ’ the shire , and represents ye all .</l>
     <l n="17">From each he meets he culls whate'er he can ;</l>
     <l n="18">Legion 's his name , a people in a man .</l>
     <l n="19">His bulky folly gathers as it goes ,</l>
     <l n="20">And , rolling o'er you , like a snow-ball grows . 20</l>
     <l n="21">His various modes from various fathers follow ;</l>
     <l n="22">One taught the toss , and one the new French wallow :</l>
     <l n="23">His sword-knot this , his cravat that design 'd ;</l>
     <l n="24">And this the yard-long snake he twirls behind .</l>
     <l n="25">From one the sacred periwig he gain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="26">Which wind ne'er blew , nor touch of hat profaned .</l>
     <l n="27">Another 's diving bow he did adore ,</l>
     <l n="28">Which with a shog casts all the hair before ,</l>
     <l n="29">Till he , with full decorum , brings it back ,</l>
     <l n="30">And rises with a water-spaniel shake . 30</l>
     <l n="31">As for his songs , the ladies ’ dear delight ,</l>
     <l n="32">These sure he took from most of you who write .</l>
     <l n="33">Yet every man is safe from what he fear 'd ;</l>
     <l n="34">For no one fool is hunted from the herd .</l>

     <l n="18">He does his best ; and if he cannot please ,</l>
     <l n="19">Would quietly sue out his writ of ease .</l>
     <l n="20">Yet , if he might his own grand jury call , 20</l>
     <l n="21">By the fair sex he begs to stand or fall .</l>
     <l n="22">Let Cæsar 's power the men 's ambition move ,</l>

     <l n="24">Yet if some antiquated lady say ,</l>
     <l n="25">The last age is not copied in his play ;</l>
     <l n="26">Heaven help the man who for that face must drudge ,</l>
     <l n="27">Which only has the wrinkles of a judge .</l>
     <l n="28">Let not the young and beauteous join with those ;</l>
     <l n="29">For should you raise such numerous hosts of foes ,</l>

     <l n="10">‘ Twas that my own abundance gave me more . 10</l>
     <l n="11">On foreign trade I needed not rely ,</l>
     <l n="12">Like fruitful Britain , rich without supply .</l>
     <l n="13">In this my rough-drawn play you shall behold</l>
     <l n="14">Some master strokes , so manly and so bold ,</l>
     <l n="15">That he who meant to alter , found ‘ em such ,</l>

     <l n="17">Now , where are the successors to my name ?</l>
     <l n="18">What bring they to fill out a poet 's fame ?</l>
     <l n="19">Weak , short-lived issues of a feeble age ;</l>
     <l n="20">Scarce living to be christen 'd on the stage ! 20</l>
     <l n="21">For humour , farce — for love they rhyme dispense ,</l>
     <l n="22">That tolls the knell for their departed sense .</l>
     <l n="23">Dulness might thrive in any trade , but this</l>
     <l n="24">‘ Twould recommend to some fat benefice :</l>
     <l n="25">Dulness , that in a playhouse meets disgrace ,</l>
     <l n="26">Might meet with reverence in its proper place .</l>
     <l n="27">The fulsome clench , that nauseates the town ,</l>
     <l n="28">Would from a judge or alderman go down ;</l>
     <l n="29">Such virtue is there in a robe and gown !</l>
     <l n="30">And that insipid stuff , which here you hate , 30</l>
     <l n="31">Might somewhere else be call 'd a grave debate :</l>
     <l n="32">Dulness is decent in the church and state .</l>
     <l n="33">But I forget that still ‘ tis understood ,</l>
     <l n="34">Bad plays are best decried by showing good .</l>
     <l n="35">Sit silent , then , that my pleased soul may see</l>
     <l n="36">A judging audience once , and worthy me ;</l>
     <l n="37">My faithful scene from true records shall tell ,</l>
     <l n="38">How Trojan valour did the Greek excel ;</l>
     <l n="39">Your great forefathers shall their fame regain ,</l>
     <l n="40">And Homer 's angry ghost repine in vain . 40</l>

     <l n="1">The unhappy man , who once has trail 'd a pen ,</l>
     <l n="2">Lives not to please himself , but other men ;</l>
     <l n="3">Is always drudging , wastes his life and blood ,</l>
     <l n="4">Yet only eats and drinks what you think good .</l>
     <l n="5">What praise soe'er the poetry deserve ,</l>
     <l n="6">Yet every fool can bid the poet starve .</l>
     <l n="7">That fumbling lecher to revenge is bent ,</l>
     <l n="8">Because he thinks himself or whore is meant :</l>
     <l n="9">Name but a cuckold , all the city swarms ;</l>
     <l n="10">From Leadenhall to Ludgate is in arms : 10</l>

     <l n="18">You love to hear of some prodigious tale ,</l>
     <l n="19">The bell that toll 'd alone , or Irish whale .</l>
     <l n="20">News is your food , and you enough provide , 20</l>
     <l n="21">Both for yourselves , and all the world beside ;</l>
     <l n="22">One theatre there is of vast resort ,</l>
     <l n="23">Which whilome of Requests was called the Court ;</l>
     <l n="24">But now the great Exchange of News ‘ tis hight ,</l>
     <l n="25">And full of hum and buzz from noon till night .</l>
     <l n="26">Up stairs and down you run , as for a race ,</l>
     <l n="27">And each man wears three nations in his face .</l>
     <l n="28">So big you look , though claret you retrench ,</l>
     <l n="29">That , arm 'd with bottled ale , you huff the French .</l>
     <l n="30">But all your entertainment still is fed 30</l>
     <l n="31">By villains in your own dull island bred .</l>
     <l n="32">Would you return to us , we dare engage</l>
     <l n="33">To show you better rogues upon the stage .</l>
     <l n="34">You know no poison but plain ratsbane here ;</l>
     <l n="35">Death 's more refined , and better bred elsewhere .</l>
     <l n="36">They have a civil way in Italy ,</l>
     <l n="37">By smelling a perfume to make you die :</l>
     <l n="38">A trick would make you lay your snuff-box by .</l>
     <l n="39">Murder 's a trade , so known and practised there ,</l>
     <l n="40">That ‘ tis infallible as is the Chair . 40</l>

    <p>PROLOGUE TO “ THE LOYAL BROTHER ; OR , THE PERSIAN PRINCE ;"[ 60 ]</p>
    <p>BY MR SOUTHERN , 1682 .</p>
     <l n="1">POETS , like lawful monarchs , ruled the stage ,</l>
     <l n="2">Till critics , like damn 'd Whigs , debauch 'd our age .</l>
     <l n="3">Mark how they jump : critics would regulate</l>
     <l n="4">Our theatres , and Whigs reform our state :</l>
     <l n="5">Both pretend love , and both ( plague rot them ! ) hate .</l>
     <l n="6">The critic humbly seems advice to bring ;</l>
     <l n="7">The fawning Whig petitions to the king :</l>
     <l n="8">But one 's advice into a satire slides ;</l>
     <l n="9">The other 's petition a remonstrance hides .</l>
     <l n="10">These will no taxes give , and those no pence ; 10</l>
     <l n="11">Critics would starve the poet , Whigs the prince .</l>
     <l n="12">The critic all our troops of friends discards ;</l>
     <l n="13">Just so the Whig would fain pull down the guards .</l>
     <l n="14">Guards are illegal , that drive foes away ,</l>
     <l n="15">As watchful shepherds , that fright beasts of prey .</l>
     <l n="16">Kings , who disband such needless aids as these ,</l>
     <l n="17">Are safe — as long as e'er their subjects please :</l>
     <l n="18">And that would be till next Queen Bess 's night :<span corresp="#note61" type="note_anchor">[ 61 ]</span></l>
     <l n="19">Which thus grave penny chroniclers indite .</l>
     <l n="20">Sir Edmondbury first , in woful wise , 20</l>
     <l n="21">Leads up the show , and milks their maudlin eyes .</l>
     <l n="22">There 's not a butcher 's wife but dribs her part ,</l>
     <l n="23">And pities the poor pageant from her heart ;</l>
     <l n="24">Who , to provoke revenge , rides round the fire ,</l>
     <l n="25">And , with a civil congé , does retire :</l>
     <l n="26">But guiltless blood to ground must never fall ;</l>
     <l n="27">There 's Antichrist behind , to pay for all .</l>
     <l n="28">The punk of Babylon in pomp appears ,</l>
     <l n="29">A lewd old gentleman of seventy years :</l>
     <l n="30">Whose age in vain our mercy would implore ; 30</l>
     <l n="31">For few take pity on an old cast whore .</l>
     <l n="32">The Devil , who brought him to the shame , takes part ;</l>
     <l n="33">Sits cheek by jowl , in black , to cheer his heart ;</l>
     <l n="34">Like thief and parson in a Tyburn-cart .</l>
     <l n="35">The word is given , and with a loud huzza</l>
     <l n="36">The mitred puppet from his chair they draw :</l>
     <l n="37">On the slain corpse contending nations fall :</l>
     <l n="38">Alas ! what 's one poor Pope among them all !</l>
     <l n="39">He burns ; now all true hearts your triumphs ring :</l>
     <l n="40">And , next , for fashion , cry , God save the king ! 40</l>
     <l n="41">A needful cry in midst of such alarms ,</l>
     <l n="42">When forty thousand men are up in arms .</l>
     <l n="43">But after he 's once saved , to make amends ,</l>
     <l n="44">In each succeeding health they damn his friends :</l>
     <l n="45">So God begins , but still the Devil ends .</l>
     <l n="46">What if some one , inspired with zeal , should call ,</l>
     <l n="47">Come , let 's go cry , God save him at Whitehall ?</l>
     <l n="48">His best friends would not like this over-care ,</l>
     <l n="49">Or think him ere the safer for this prayer .</l>
     <l n="50">Five praying saints are by an act allow 'd ;<span corresp="#note62" type="note_anchor">[ 62 ]</span>50</l>
     <l n="51">But not the whole church-militant in crowd .</l>
     <l n="52">Yet , should Heaven all the true petitions drain</l>
     <l n="53">Of Presbyterians , who would kings maintain ,</l>
     <l n="54">Of forty thousand , five would scarce remain .</l>

     <l n="4">And here poetic prizes lost or won .</l>
     <l n="5">Methinks I see you , crown 'd with olives , sit ,</l>
     <l n="6">And strike a sacred horror from the pit .</l>
     <l n="7">A day of doom is this of your decree ,</l>

     <l n="11">Come to be taught themselves to teach the age .</l>

     <l n="13">To cultivate the virtue which you sow ;</l>
     <l n="14">In your Lycaeum first themselves refined ,</l>

     <l n="18">So poets , who your precepts have forgot ,</l>
     <l n="19">Return , and beg they may be better taught :</l>
     <l n="20">Follies and faults elsewhere by them are shown , 20</l>
     <l n="21">But by your manners they correct their own .</l>
     <l n="22">The illiterate writer , empiric-like , applies</l>
     <l n="23">To minds diseased unsafe , chance remedies :</l>
     <l n="24">The learn 'd in schools , where knowledge first began ,</l>
     <l n="25">Studies with care the anatomy of man ;</l>
     <l n="26">Sees virtue , vice , and passions in their cause ,</l>
     <l n="27">And fame from science , not from fortune , draws .</l>
     <l n="28">So Poetry , which is in Oxford made</l>
     <l n="29">An art , in London only is a trade .</l>
     <l n="30">There haughty dunces , whose unlearned pen 30</l>

     <l n="35">They call that nature , which is ignorance .</l>
     <l n="36">To such a fame let mere town wits aspire ,</l>

     <l n="38">Our poet , could he find forgiveness here ,</l>
     <l n="39">Would wish it rather than a plaudit there .</l>
     <l n="40">He owns no crown from those Prætorian bands , 40</l>
     <l n="41">But knows that right is in the senate 's hands ;</l>
     <l n="42">Not impudent enough to hope your praise ,</l>

     <l n="11">The Italian Merry-Andrews took their place ,</l>

     <l n="20">Some new-born monster shown you for a play . 20</l>
     <l n="21">But when all fail 'd , to strike the stage quite dumb ,</l>

     <l n="29">Witchcraft reigns there , and raises to renown</l>
     <l n="30">Macbeth and Simon Magus of the town , 30</l>
     <l n="31">Fletcher 's despised , your Jonson 's out of fashion ,</l>

    <head>PROLOGUE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD .</head>
     <l n="1">Though actors cannot much of learning boast ,</l>
     <l n="2">Of all who want it , we admire it most :</l>
     <l n="3">We love the praises of a learned pit ,</l>
     <l n="4">As we remotely are allied to wit .</l>
     <l n="5">We speak our poet 's wit , and trade in ore ,</l>
     <l n="6">Like those who touch upon the golden shore :</l>
     <l n="7">Betwixt our judges can destinction make ,</l>
     <l n="8">Discern how much , and why , our poems take :</l>
     <l n="9">Mark if the fools , or men of sense , rejoice ;</l>
     <l n="10">Whether the applause be only sound or voice . 10</l>
     <l n="11">When our fop gallants , or our city folly ,</l>
     <l n="12">Clap over-loud , it makes us melancholy :</l>
     <l n="13">We doubt that scene which does their wonder raise ,</l>
     <l n="14">And , for their ignorance , contemn their praise .</l>
     <l n="15">Judge then , if we who act , and they who write ,</l>
     <l n="16">Should not be proud of giving you delight .</l>
     <l n="17">London likes grossly ; but this nicer pit</l>
     <l n="18">Examines , fathoms all the depths of wit ;</l>
     <l n="19">The ready finger lays on every blot ;</l>
     <l n="20">Knows what should justly please , and what should not . 20</l>
     <l n="21">Nature herself lies open to your view ;</l>
     <l n="22">You judge by her , what draught of her is true ,</l>
     <l n="23">Where outlines false , and colours seem too faint ,</l>
     <l n="24">Where bunglers daub , and where true poets paint .</l>
     <l n="25">But by the sacred genius of this place ,</l>
     <l n="26">By every Muse , by each domestic grace ,</l>
     <l n="27">Be kind to wit , which but endeavours well ,</l>
     <l n="28">And , where you judge , presumes not to excel .</l>
     <l n="29">Our poets hither for adoption come ,</l>
     <l n="30">As nations sued to be made free of Rome : 30</l>
     <l n="31">Not in the suffragating tribes to stand ,</l>
     <l n="32">But in your utmost , last , provincial band .</l>
     <l n="33">If his ambition may those hopes pursue ,</l>
     <l n="34">Who with religion loves your arts and you ,</l>
     <l n="35">Oxford to him a dearer name shall be ,</l>
     <l n="36">Than his own mother university .</l>
     <l n="37">Thebes did his green , unknowing youth engage ;</l>
     <l n="38">He chooses Athens in his riper age .</l>

     <l n="1">Full twenty years and more , our labouring stage</l>
     <l n="2">Has lost on this incorrigible age :</l>
     <l n="3">Our poets , the John Ketches of the nation ,</l>
     <l n="4">Have seem 'd to lash ye , even to excoriation :</l>
     <l n="5">But still no sign remains ; which plainly notes ,</l>
     <l n="6">You bore like heroes , or you bribed like Oates .</l>
     <l n="7">What can we do , when mimicking a fop ,</l>
     <l n="8">Like beating nut-trees , makes a larger crop ?</l>
     <l n="9">Faith , we 'll e'en spare our pains ! and , to content you ,</l>
     <l n="10">Will fairly leave you what your Maker meant you . 10</l>
     <l n="11">Satire was once your physic , wit your food :</l>
     <l n="12">One nourish 'd not , and t'other drew no blood :</l>
     <l n="13">We now prescribe , like doctors in despair ,</l>
     <l n="14">The diet your weak appetites can bear .</l>
     <l n="15">Since hearty beef and mutton will not do ,</l>
     <l n="16">Here 's julep-dance , ptisan of song and show :</l>
     <l n="17">Give you strong sense , the liquor is too heady :</l>
     <l n="18">You 're come to farce ,— that 's asses ’ milk ,— already .</l>
     <l n="19">Some hopeful youths there are , of callow wit ,</l>
     <l n="20">Who one day may be men , if Heaven think fit : 20</l>
     <l n="21">Sound may serve such , ere they to sense are grown ,</l>
     <l n="22">Like leading-strings till they can walk alone .</l>
     <l n="23">But yet , to keep our friends in countenance , know ,</l>
     <l n="24">The wise Italians first invented show :</l>
     <l n="25">Thence into France the noble pageant pass 'd :</l>
     <l n="26">‘ Tis England 's credit to be cozen 'd last .</l>
     <l n="27">Freedom and zeal have choused you o'er and o'er :</l>
     <l n="28">Pray give us leave to bubble you once more ;</l>
     <l n="29">You never were so cheaply fool 'd before :</l>

     <l n="30">We bring you change , to humour your disease ; 30</l>
     <l n="31">Change for the worse has ever used to please :</l>
     <l n="32">Then , ‘ tis the mode of France ; without whose rules</l>
     <l n="33">None must presume to set up here for fools .</l>
     <l n="34">In France , the oldest man is always young ,</l>
     <l n="35">Sees operas daily , learns the tunes so long ,</l>
     <l n="36">Till foot , hand , head keep time with every song :</l>
     <l n="37">Each sings his part , echoing from pit and box ,</l>
     <l n="38">With his hoarse voice , half harmony , half pox :</l>
     <l n="39">Le plus grand roi du monde is always ringing ,</l>
     <l n="40">They show themselves good subjects by their singing : 40</l>
     <l n="41">On that condition , set up every throat :</l>
     <l n="42">You Whigs may sing , for you have changed your note .</l>
     <l n="43">Cits and citesses raise a joyful strain ,</l>
     <l n="44">‘ Tis a good omen to begin a reign :</l>
     <l n="45">Voices may help your charter to restoring ,</l>
     <l n="46">And get by singing what you lost by roaring .</l>

     <l n="1">After our Æsop 's fable shown to-day ,</l>
     <l n="2">I come to give the moral of the play .</l>
     <l n="3">Feign 'd Zeal , you saw , set out the speedier pace :</l>
     <l n="4">But the last heat , Plain Dealing won the race :</l>
     <l n="5">Plain Dealing for a jewel has been known ;</l>
     <l n="6">But ne'er till now the jewel of a crown .</l>
     <l n="7">When Heaven made man , to show the work divine ,</l>
     <l n="8">Truth was His image stamp 'd upon the coin :</l>
     <l n="9">And when a king is to a god refined ,</l>
     <l n="10">On all he says and does he stamps his mind : 10</l>
     <l n="11">This proves a soul without alloy , and pure ;</l>
     <l n="12">Kings , like their gold , should every touch endure .</l>
     <l n="13">To dare in fields is valour ; but how few</l>
     <l n="14">Dare be so thoroughly valiant ,— to be true !</l>
     <l n="15">The name of great let other kings affect :</l>
     <l n="16">He 's great indeed , the prince that is direct .</l>
     <l n="17">His subjects know him now , and trust him more</l>
     <l n="18">Than all their kings , and all their laws before .</l>
     <l n="19">What safety could their public acts afford ?</l>
     <l n="20">Those he can break ; but cannot break his word . 20</l>
     <l n="21">So great a trust to him alone was due ;</l>
     <l n="22">Well have they trusted whom so well they knew .</l>
     <l n="23">The saint , who walk 'd on waves , securely trod ,</l>
     <l n="24">While he believed the beckoning of his God :</l>
     <l n="25">But when his faith no longer bore him out ,</l>
     <l n="26">Began to sink , as he began to doubt .</l>
     <l n="27">Let us our native character maintain ;</l>
     <l n="28">‘ Tis of our growth to be sincerely plain .</l>
     <l n="29">To excel in truth we loyally may strive ,</l>
     <l n="30">Set privilege against prerogative : 30</l>
     <l n="31">He plights his faith , and we believe him just ;</l>
     <l n="32">His honour is to promise , ours to trust .</l>
     <l n="33">Thus Britain 's basis on a word is laid ,</l>
     <l n="34">As by a word the world itself was made .</l>

     <l n="8">To laugh and break your buttons at their play ;</l>
     <l n="9">Or see some serious piece , which we presume</l>
     <l n="10">Is fallen from some incomparable plume ; 10</l>
     <l n="11">And therefore , Messieurs , if you 'll do us grace ,</l>

     <l n="16">Neither to hear nor see , but show their breeding :</l>
     <l n="17">Each lady striving to out-laugh the rest ;</l>
     <l n="18">To make it seem they understood the jest .</l>
     <l n="19">Their countrymen come in , and nothing pay ,</l>
     <l n="20">To teach us English where to clap the play : 20</l>
     <l n="21">Civil , egad ! our hospitable land</l>
     <l n="22">Bears all the charge , for them to understand :</l>
     <l n="23">Mean time we languish and neglected lie ,</l>
     <l n="24">Like wives , while you keep better company ;</l>
     <l n="25">And wish for your own sakes , without a satire ,</l>

    <p>PROLOGUE TO “ THE MISTAKES . ”</p>
    <p>BY JOSEPH HARRIS , COMEDIAN , 1690 . ( WRITTEN BY SOME OTHER . )</p>
     <l n="1">Enter Mr Bright .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Gentlemen , we must beg your pardon ; here 's no Prologue to be had to-day ; our new play is like to come on , without a frontispiece ; as bald as one of you young beaux , without your periwig . I left our young poet , snivelling and sobbing behind the scenes , and cursing somebody that has deceived him .</p>
   <p>Enter Mr Bowen .</p>
   <p>Hold your prating to the audience : here is honest Mr Williams , just come in , half mellow , from the Rose Tavern . He swears he is inspired with claret , and will come on , and that extempore too , either with a prologue of his own or something like one . Oh , here he comes to his trial , at all adventures : for my part I wish him a good deliverance .</p>
   <p>[ Exeunt Mr Bright and Mr Bowen .</p>
   <p>Enter Mr Williams .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Save ye , sirs , save ye ! I am in a hopeful way .</l>
     <l n="2">I should speak something in rhyme , now , for the play :</l>
     <l n="3">But the deuce take me , if I know what to say .</l>
     <l n="4">I 'll stick to my friend the author , that I can tell ye ,</l>
     <l n="5">To the last drop of claret in my belly .</l>
     <l n="6">So far I 'm sure ‘ tis rhyme — that needs no granting :</l>
     <l n="7">And , if my verses ’ feet stumble — you see my own are wanting .</l>
     <l n="8">Our young poet has brought a piece of work ,</l>
     <l n="9">In which , though much of art there does not lurk ,</l>
     <l n="10">It may hold out three days — and that 's as long as Cork . 10</l>
     <l n="11">But for this play ( which till I have done , we show not )</l>
     <l n="12">What may be its fortune — by the Lord ! I know not .</l>
     <l n="13">This I dare swear , no malice here is writ :</l>
     <l n="14">‘ Tis innocent of all things — even of wit .</l>
     <l n="15">He 's no highflier — he makes no sky-rockets ,</l>
     <l n="16">His squibs are only levell 'd at your pockets .</l>
     <l n="17">And if his crackers light among your pelf ,</l>
     <l n="18">You are blown up ; if not , then he 's blown up himself .</l>
     <l n="19">By this time , I 'm something recover 'd of my fluster 'd madness :</l>
     <l n="20">And now , a word or two in sober sadness . 20</l>
     <l n="21">Ours is a common play ; and you pay down</l>
     <l n="22">A common harlot 's price — just half-a-crown .</l>
     <l n="23">You 'll say , I play the pimp , on my friend 's score ;</l>
     <l n="24">But since ‘ tis for a friend your gibes give o'er :</l>
     <l n="25">For many a mother has done that before .</l>
     <l n="26">How 's this ? you cry ; an actor write ?— we know it ;</l>
     <l n="27">But Shakspeare was an actor , and a poet .</l>
     <l n="28">Has not great Jonson 's learning often fail 'd ?</l>

     <l n="30">Have not some writing actors , in this age , 30</l>
     <l n="31">Deserved and found success upon the stage ?</l>
     <l n="32">To tell the truth , when our old wits are tired ,</l>
     <l n="33">Not one of us but means to be inspired .</l>
     <l n="34">Let your kind presence grace our homely cheer ;</l>

    <head>PROLOGUE TO “ KING ARTHUR . ”</head>
    <head>SPOKEN BY MR BETTERTON .</head>
     <l n="1">Sure there 's a dearth of wit in this dull town ,</l>
     <l n="2">When silly plays so savourily go down ;</l>
     <l n="3">As , when clipt money passes , ‘ tis a sign</l>
     <l n="4">A nation is not over-stock 'd with coin .</l>
     <l n="5">Happy is he who , in his own defence ,</l>
     <l n="6">Can write just level to your humble sense ;</l>
     <l n="7">Who higher than your pitch can never go ;</l>
     <l n="8">And , doubtless , he must creep , who writes below .</l>
     <l n="9">So have I seen , in hall of knight , or lord ,</l>
     <l n="10">A weak arm throw on a long shovel-board ; 10</l>
     <l n="11">He barely lays his piece , bar rubs and knocks ,</l>
     <l n="12">Secured by weakness not to reach the box .</l>
     <l n="13">A feeble poet will his business do ,</l>
     <l n="14">Who , straining all he can , comes up to you :</l>
     <l n="15">For , if you like yourselves , you like him too .</l>
     <l n="16">An ape his own dear image will embrace ;</l>
     <l n="17">An ugly beau adores a hatchet face :</l>
     <l n="18">So , some of you , on pure instinct of nature ,</l>
     <l n="19">Are led , by kind , to admire your fellow-creature .</l>
     <l n="20">In fear of which , our house has sent this day , 20</l>
     <l n="21">To insure our new-built vessel , call 'd a play ;</l>
     <l n="22">No sooner named , than one cries out , These stagers</l>
     <l n="23">Come in good time , to make more work for wagers .</l>
     <l n="24">The town divides , if it will take or no :</l>
     <l n="25">The courtiers bet , the cits , the merchants too ;</l>
     <l n="26">A sign they have but little else to do .</l>
     <l n="27">Bets , at the first , were fool-traps ; where the wise ,</l>
     <l n="28">Like spiders , lay in ambush for the flies :</l>
     <l n="29">But now they 're grown a common trade for all ,</l>
     <l n="30">And actions by the new book rise and fall ; 30</l>
     <l n="31">Wits , cheats , and fops , are free of wager-hall .</l>
     <l n="32">One policy as far as Lyons carries ;</l>
     <l n="33">Another , nearer home , sets up for Paris .</l>
     <l n="34">Our bets , at last , would e'en to Rome extend ,</l>
     <l n="35">But that the pope has proved our trusty friend .</l>
     <l n="36">Indeed , it were a bargain worth our money ,</l>
     <l n="37">Could we insure another Ottoboni .</l>
     <l n="38">Among the rest there are a sharping set ,</l>
     <l n="39">That pray for us , and yet against us bet .</l>
     <l n="40">Sure Heaven itself is at a loss to know 40</l>
     <l n="41">If these would have their prayers be heard , or no :</l>
     <l n="42">For , in great stakes , we piously suppose ,</l>
     <l n="43">Men pray but very faintly they may lose .</l>
     <l n="44">Leave off these wagers ; for , in conscience speaking ,</l>
     <l n="45">The city needs not your new tricks for breaking :</l>
     <l n="46">And if you gallants lose , to all appearing ,</l>
     <l n="47">You 'll want an equipage for volunteering ;</l>
     <l n="48">While thus , no spark of honour left within ye ,</l>
     <l n="49">When you should draw the sword , you draw the guinea .</l>

    <head>PROLOGUE TO “ ALBUMAZAR . "[ 67 ]</head>
     <l n="1">To say , this comedy pleased long ago ,</l>
     <l n="2">Is not enough to make it pass you now .</l>
     <l n="3">Yet , gentlemen , your ancestors had wit ;</l>
     <l n="4">When few men censured , and when fewer writ .</l>
     <l n="5">And Jonson , of those few the best , chose this</l>
     <l n="6">As the best model of his masterpiece .</l>
     <l n="7">Subtle was got by our Albumazar ,</l>
     <l n="8">That Alchymist by this Astrologer ;</l>
     <l n="9">Here he was fashion 'd , and we may suppose</l>
     <l n="10">He liked the fashion well , who wore the clothes . 10</l>
     <l n="11">But Ben made nobly his what he did mould ;</l>
     <l n="12">What was another 's lead becomes his gold :</l>
     <l n="13">Like an unrighteous conqueror he reigns ,</l>
     <l n="14">Yet rules that well which he unjustly gains .</l>
     <l n="15">By this our age such authors does afford ,</l>
     <l n="16">As make whole plays , and yet scarce write one word :</l>
     <l n="17">Who , in his anarchy of wit , rob all ,</l>
     <l n="18">And what 's their plunder , their possession call :</l>
     <l n="19">Who , like bold padders , scorn by night to prey ,</l>
     <l n="20">But rob by sunshine , in the face of day : 20</l>
     <l n="21">Nay , scarce the common ceremony use</l>
     <l n="22">Of , Stand , sir , and deliver up your Muse ;</l>
     <l n="23">But knock the Poet down , and , with a grace ,</l>
     <l n="24">Mount Pegasus before the owner 's face .</l>
     <l n="25">Faith , if you have such country Toms abroad ,</l>
     <l n="26">‘ Tis time for all true men to leave that road .</l>
     <l n="27">Yet it were modest , could it but be said ,</l>
     <l n="28">They strip the living , but these rob the dead ;</l>
     <l n="29">Dare with the mummies of the Muses play ,</l>
     <l n="30">And make love to them the Egyptian way ; 30</l>
     <l n="31">Or , as a rhyming author would have said ,</l>
     <l n="32">Join the dead living to the living dead .</l>
     <l n="33">Such men in poetry may claim some part :</l>
     <l n="34">They have the licence , though they want the art ;</l>
     <l n="35">And might , where theft was praised , for Laureates stand ,—</l>
     <l n="36">Poets , not of the head , but of the hand .</l>
     <l n="37">They make the benefits of others ’ studying ,</l>
     <l n="38">Much like the meals of politic Jack-Pudding ,</l>
     <l n="39">Whose dish to challenge no man has the courage ;</l>
     <l n="40">‘ Tis all his own , when once he has spit in the porridge . 40</l>
     <l n="41">But , gentlemen , you 're all concern 'd in this ;</l>
     <l n="42">You are in fault for what they do amiss :</l>
     <l n="43">For they their thefts still undiscover 'd think ,</l>
     <l n="44">And durst not steal unless you please to wink .</l>
     <l n="45">Perhaps you may award , by your decree ,</l>
     <l n="46">They should refund ; but that can never be .</l>
     <l n="47">For should your letters of reprisal seal ,</l>
     <l n="48">These men write that which no man else would steal .</l>

     <l n="1">You saw our wife was chaste , yet thoroughly tried ,</l>

     <l n="15">Who act those follies , Poets toil to write !</l>
     <l n="16">The sweating Muse does almost leave the chase ;</l>

     <l n="18">Pinch you but in one vice , away you fly</l>

     <l n="22">Your Venus once was a Platonic queen ;</l>

    <head>BY MR JOHN DRYDEN , JUN ., 1696 .<span corresp="#note68" type="note_anchor">[ 68 ]</span></head>
     <l n="1">Like some raw sophister that mounts the pulpit ,</l>
     <l n="2">So trembles a young Poet at a full pit .</l>
     <l n="3">Unused to crowds , the parson quakes for fear ,</l>
     <l n="4">And wonders how the devil he durst come there ;</l>
     <l n="5">Wanting three talents needful for the place —</l>
     <l n="6">Some beard , some learning , and some little grace .</l>
     <l n="7">Nor is the puny Poet void of care ;</l>
     <l n="8">For authors , such as our new authors are ,</l>
     <l n="9">Have not much learning , nor much wit to spare :</l>
     <l n="10">And as for grace , to tell the truth , there 's scarce one 10</l>
     <l n="11">But has as little as the very Parson :</l>
     <l n="12">Both say , they preach and write for your instruction :</l>
     <l n="13">But ‘ tis for a third day , and for induction .</l>
     <l n="14">The difference is , that though you like the play ,</l>
     <l n="15">The Poet 's gain is ne'er beyond his day .</l>
     <l n="16">But with the Parson ‘ tis another case ,</l>
     <l n="17">He , without holiness , may rise to grace .</l>
     <l n="18">The Poet has one disadvantage more ,</l>
     <l n="19">That if his play be dull , he 's damn 'd all o'er ,</l>
     <l n="20">Not only a damn 'd blockhead , but damn 'd poor . 20</l>
     <l n="21">But dulness well becomes the sable garment ;</l>
     <l n="22">I warrant that ne'er spoil 'd a Priest 's perferment :</l>
     <l n="23">Wit 's not his business , and as wit now goes ,</l>
     <l n="24">Sirs , ‘ tis not so much yours as you suppose ,</l>
     <l n="25">For you like nothing now but nauseous beaux .</l>
     <l n="26">You laugh not , gallants , as by proof appears ,</l>
     <l n="27">At what his beauship says , but what he wears ;</l>
     <l n="28">So ‘ tis your eyes are tickled , not your ears .</l>
     <l n="29">The tailor and the furrier find the stuff ,</l>
     <l n="30">The wit lies in the dress , and monstrous muff . 30</l>
     <l n="31">The truth on ‘ t is , the payment of the pit</l>
     <l n="32">Is like for like , clipt money for clipt wit .</l>
     <l n="33">You cannot from our absent author hope</l>
     <l n="34">He should equip the stage with such a fop :</l>
     <l n="35">Fools change in England , and new fools arise ,</l>
     <l n="36">For though the immortal species never dies ,</l>
     <l n="37">Yet every year new maggots make new flies ;</l>
     <l n="38">But where he lives abroad , he scarce can find</l>
     <l n="39">One fool for millions that he left behind .</l>

    <p>TALES FROM CHAUCER .</p>
    <p>TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND .</p>
     <l n="1">Anno 1699 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>My Lord ,— Some estates are held in England by paying a fine at the change of every lord : I have enjoyed the patronage of your family , from the time of your excellent grandfather to this present day . I have dedicated the translation of the “ Lives of Plutarch ” to the first Duke ; and have celebrated the memory of your heroic father . Though I am very short of the age of Nestor , yet I have lived to a third generation of your house ; and by your Grace 's favour am admitted still to hold from you by the same tenure .</p>
   <p>I am not vain enough to boast that I have deserved the value of so illustrious a line ; but my fortune is the greater , that for three descents they have been pleased to distinguish my poems from those of other men ; and have accordingly made me their peculiar care . May it be permitted me to say , that , as your grandfather and father were cherished and adorned with honours by two successive monarchs , so I have been esteemed and patronised by the grandfather , the father , and the son , descended from one of the most ancient , most conspicuous , and most deserving families in Europe ?</p>
   <p>It is true , that by delaying the payment of my last fine , when it was due by your Grace 's accession to the titles and patrimonies of your house , I may seem , in rigour of law , to have made a forfeiture of my claim ; yet my heart has always been devoted to your service ; and since you have been graciously pleased , by your permission of this address , to accept the tender of my duty , it is not yet too late to lay these poems at your feet .</p>
   <p>The world is sensible that you worthily succeed , not only to the honours of your ancestors , but also to their virtues . The long chain of magnanimity , courage , easiness of access , and desire of doing good even to the prejudice of your fortune , is so far from being broken in your Grace , that the precious metal yet runs pure to the newest link of it ; which I will not call the last , because I hope and pray it may descend to late posterity : and your flourishing youth , and that of your excellent Duchess , are happy omens of my wish . It is observed by Livy and by others , that some of the noblest Roman families retained a resemblance of their ancestry , not only in their shapes and features , but also in their manners , their qualities , and the distinguishing characters of their minds . Some lines were noted for a stern , rigid virtue , savage , haughty , parsimonious , and unpopular : others were more sweet and affable , made of a more pliant paste , humble , courteous , and obliging , studious of doing charitable offices , and diffusive of the goods which they enjoyed . The last of these is the proper and indelible character of your Grace 's family . God Almighty has endued you with a softness , a beneficence , an attractive behaviour winning on the hearts of others ; and so sensible of their misery , that the wounds of fortune seem not inflicted on them , but on yourself . You are so ready to redress , that you almost prevent their wishes , and always exceed their expectations ; as if what was yours , was not your own , and not given you to possess , but to bestow on wanting merit . But this is a topic which I must cast in shades , lest I offend your modesty , which is so far from being ostentatious of the good you do , that it blushes even to have it known ; and therefore I must leave you to the satisfaction and testimony of your own conscience , which , though it be a silent panegyric , is yet the best .</p>
   <p>You are so easy of access , that Poplicola was not more , whose doors were opened on the outside to save the people even the common civility of asking entrance ; where all were equally admitted — where nothing that was reasonable was denied — where misfortune was a powerful recommendation , and where ( I can scarce forbear saying ) that want itself was a powerful mediator , and was next to merit .</p>
   <p>The history of Peru assures us , that their Incas , above all their titles esteemed that the highest which called them Lovers of the Poor — a name more glorious than the Felix , Pius , and Augustus of the Roman emperors , which were epithets of flattery , deserved by few of them , and not running in a blood like the perpetual gentleness and inherent goodness of the Ormond family .</p>
   <p>Gold , as it is the purest , so it is the softest and most ductile of all metals . Iron , which is the hardest , gathers rust , corrodes itself , and is therefore subject to corruption ; it was never intended for coins and medals , or to bear the faces and inscriptions of the great . Indeed , it is fit for armour , to bear off insults , and preserve the wearer in the day of battle ; but the danger once repelled , it is laid aside by the brave , as a garment too rough for civil conversation ; a necessary guard in war , but too harsh and cumbersome in peace , and which keeps off the embraces of a more humane life .</p>
   <p>For this reason , my Lord , though you have courage in an heroical degree , yet I ascribe it to you but as your second attribute : mercy , beneficence , and compassion claim precedence , as they are first in the Divine nature . An intrepid courage , which is inherent in your Grace , is at best but a holiday kind of virtue , to be seldom exercised , and never but in cases of necessity : affability , mildness , tenderness , and a word which I would fain bring back to its original signification of virtue , I mean good-nature , are of daily use : they are the bread of mankind , and staff of life ; neither sighs , nor tears , nor groans , nor curses of the vanquished , follow acts of compassion and of charity , but a sincere pleasure and serenity of mind , in him who performs an action of mercy , which cannot suffer the misfortunes of another without redress , lest they should bring a kind of contagion along with them , and pollute the happiness which he enjoys .</p>
   <p>Yet since the perverse tempers of mankind , since oppression on one side , and ambition on the other , are sometimes the unavoidable occasions of war ; that courage , that magnanimity , and resolution , which is born with you , cannot be too much commended . And here it grieves me that I am scanted in the pleasure of dwelling on many of your actions ; but [ Greek : aideomai Troas ] is an expression which Tully often uses , when he would do what he dares not , and fears the censure of the Romans .</p>
   <p>I have sometimes been forced to amplify on others ; but here , where the subject is so fruitful that the harvest overcomes the reaper , I am shortened by my chain , and can only see what is forbidden me to reach , since it is not permitted me to commend you , according to the extent of my wishes , and much less is it in my power to make my commendations equal to your merits . Yet in this frugality of your praises there are some things which I cannot omit without detracting from your character . You have so formed your own education , as enables you to pay the debt you owe your country ; or , more properly speaking , both your countries , because you were born , I may almost say , in purple , at the castle of Dublin , when your grandfather was Lord-Lieutenant , and have since been bred in the court of England .</p>
   <p>If this address had been in verse , I might have called you , as Claudian calls Mercury , Numen commune , gemino faciens commercia mundo . The better to satisfy this double obligation , you have early cultivated the genius you have to arms , that when the service of Britain or Ireland shall require your courage and your conduct , you may exert them both to the benefit of either country . You began in the Cabinet what you afterwards practised in the Camp ; and thus both Lucullas and Cæsar ( to omit a crowd of shining Romans ) formed themselves to war by the study of history , and by the examples of the greatest captains , both of Greece and Italy , before their time . I name those two commanders in particular , because they were better read in chronicle than any of the Roman leaders ; and that Lucullus , in particular , having only the theory of war from books , was thought fit , without practice , to be sent into the field against the most formidable enemy of Rome . Tully , indeed , was called the learned consul in derision ; but then he was not born a soldier — his head was turned another way ; when he read the Tactics , he was thinking on the bar , which was his field of battle . The knowledge of warfare is thrown away on a general who dares not make use of what he knows . I commend it only in a man of courage and resolution : in him it will direct his martial spirit , and teach him the way to the best victories ,— which are those which are least bloody , and which , though achieved by the hand , are managed by the head . Science distinguishes a man of honour from one of those athletic brutes whom undeservedly we call heroes . Cursed be the poet who first honoured with that name a mere Ajax , a man-killing idiot ! The Ulysses of Ovid upbraids his ignorance , that he understood not the shield for which he pleaded : there was engraven on it plans of cities and maps of countries which Ajax could not comprehend , but looked on them as stupidly as his fellow-beast , the lion . But on the other side , your Grace has given yourself the education of his rival ; you have studied every spot of ground in Flanders , which for these ten years past has been the scene of battles and of sieges . No wonder if you performed your part with such applause on a theatre which you understood so well .</p>
   <p>If I designed this for a poetical encomium , it were easy to enlarge on so copious a subject ; but , confining myself to the severity of truth , and to what is becoming me to say , I must not only pass over many instances of your military skill , but also those of your assiduous diligence in the war , and of your personal bravery , attended with an ardent thirst of honour — a long train of generosity — profuseness of doing good — a soul unsatisfied with all it has done and an unextinguished desire of doing more . But all this is matter for your own historians ; I am , as Virgil says , Spatiis exclusus iniquis .</p>
   <p>Yet not to be wholly silent of all your charities , I must stay a little on one action , which preferred the relief of others to the consideration of yourself . When , in the battle of Landen , your heat of courage ( a fault only pardonable to your youth ) had transported you so far before your friends , that they were unable to follow , much less to succour you ; when you were not only dangerously , but in all appearance mortally wounded ; when in that desperate condition you were made prisoner and carried to Namur , at that time in possession of the French : then it was , my Lord , that you took a considerable part of what was remitted to you of your own revenues , and , as a memorable instance of your heroic charity , put it into the bands of Count Guiscard , who was governor of the place , to be distributed among your fellow-prisoners . The French commander , charmed with the greatness of your soul , accordingly consigned it to the use for which it was intended by the donor ; by which means the lives of so many miserable men were saved , and a comfortable provision made for their subsistence , who had otherwise perished , had not you been the companion of their misfortune ; or rather sent by Providence , like another Joseph , to keep out famine from invading those whom in humility you called your brethren . How happy was it for those poor creatures that your Grace was made their fellow-sufferer ! and how glorious for you that you chose to want rather than not relieve the wants of others ! The heathen poet , in commending the charity of Dido to the Trojans , spoke like a Christian : Non ignara mali , miseris succurrere disco . All men , even those of a different interest , and contrary principles , must praise this action as the most eminent for piety , not only in this degenerate age , but almost in any of the former ; when men were made de meliore luto ; when examples of charity were frequent , and when there were in being , Teucri pulcherrima proles , magnanimi heroes nati melioribus annis . No envy can detract from this : it will shine in history , and , like swans , grow whiter the longer it endures , and the name of ORMOND will be more celebrated in his captivity than in his greatest triumphs .</p>
   <p>But all actions of your Grace are of a piece , as waters keep the tenor of their fountains : your compassion is general , and has the same effect as well on enemies as friends . It is so much in your nature to do good , that your life is but one continued act of placing benefits on many , as the sun is always carrying his light to some part or other of the world ; and were it not that your reason guides you where to give , I might almost say that you could not help bestowing more than is consisting with the fortune of a private man or with the will of any but an Alexander .</p>
   <p>What wonder is it , then , that being born for a blessing to mankind , your supposed death in that engagement was so generally lamented through the nation ! The concernment for it was as universal as the loss ; and though the gratitude might be counterfeit in some , yet the tears of all were real : where every man deplored his private part in that calamity , and even those who had not tasted of your favours , yet built so much on the fame of your beneficence , that they bemoaned the loss of their expectations .</p>
   <p>This brought the untimely death of your great father into fresh remembrance : as if the same decree had passed on two short successive generations of the virtuous ; and I repeated to myself the same verses which I had formerly applied to him : Ostendunt terris hunc tantùm fata , nec ultrà esse sinunt . But to the joy , not only of all good men , but of mankind in general , the unhappy omen took not place . You are still living to enjoy the blessings and applause of all the good you have performed , the prayers of multitudes whom you have obliged , for your long prosperity ; and that your power of doing generous and charitable actions may be as extended as your will ; which is by none more zealously desired than by your Grace 's most humble , most obliged , and most obedient servant , JOHN DRYDEN .</p>
   <p>PREFACE .</p>
   <p>It is with a poet as with a man who designs to build , and is very exact , as he supposes , in casting up the cost beforehand ; but , generally speaking , he is mistaken in his account , and reckons short in the expense he first intended . He alters his mind as the work proceeds , and will have this or that convenience more , of which he had not thought when he began . So has it happened to me : I have built a house , where I intended but a lodge ; yet with better success than a certain nobleman , who , beginning with a dog-kennel , never lived to finish the palace he had contrived .</p>
   <p>From translating the first of Homer 's Iliads ( which I intended as an essay to the whole work ) I proceeded to the translation of the twelfth book of Ovid 's Metamorphoses , because it contains , among other things , the causes , the beginning , and ending of the Trojan war . Here I ought in reason to have stopped ; but the speeches of Ajax and Ulysses lying next in my way , I could not baulk them . When I had compassed them , I was so taken with the former part of the fifteenth book , which is the masterpiece of the whole Metamorphoses , that I enjoined myself the pleasing task of rendering it into English . And now I found , by the number of my verses , that they began to swell into a little volume ; which gave me an occasion of looking backward on some beauties of my author , in his former books . There occurred to me the hunting of the boar , Cinyras and Myrrha , the good-natured story of Baucis and Philemon , with the rest , which I hope I have translated closely enough , and given them the same turn of verse which they had in the original ; and this , I may say without vanity , is not the talent of every poet . He who has arrived the nearest to it , is the ingenious and learned Sandys , the best versifier of the former age ; if I may properly call it by that name , which was the former part of this concluding century . For Spenser and Fairfax both flourished in the reign of Queen Elizabeth ; great masters in our language ; and who saw much farther into the beauties of our numbers , than those who immediately followed them . Milton was the poetical son of Spenser , and Mr Waller of Fairfax ; for we have our lineal descents and clans , as well as other families . Spenser more than once insinuates , that the soul of Chaucer was transfused into his body ; and that he was begotten by him two hundred years after his decease . Milton has acknowledged to me , that Spenser was his original ; and many besides myself have heard our famous Waller own , that he derived the harmony of his numbers from the Godfrey of Bulloigne , which was turned into English by Mr Fairfax . But to return . Having done with Ovid for this time , it came into my mind , that our old English poet Chaucer in many things resembled him , and that with no disadvantage on the side of the modern author , as I shall endeavour to prove when I compare them . And as I am , and always have been , studious to promote the honour of my native country , so I soon resolved to put their merits to the trial , by turning some of the Canterbury tales into our language , as it is now refined ; for by this means , both the poets being set in the same light , and dressed in the same English habit , story to be compared with story , a certain judgment may be made betwixt them , by the reader , without obtruding my opinion on him . Or if I seem partial to my countryman , and predecessor in the laurel , the friends of antiquity are not few ; and besides many of the learned , Ovid has almost all the beaux , and the whole fair sex , his declared patrons . Perhaps I have assumed somewhat more to myself than they allow me , because I have adventured to sum up the evidence ; but the readers are the jury , and their privilege remains entire to decide according to the merits of the cause , or , if they please , to bring it to another hearing , before some other court . In the meantime , to follow the thread of my discourse ( as thoughts , according to Mr Hobbs , have always some connexion ) , so from Chaucer I was led to think on Boccace , who was not only his contemporary , but also pursued the same studies ; wrote novels in prose , and many works in verse : particularly is said to have invented the octave rhyme , or stanza of eight lines , which ever since has been maintained by the practice of all Italian writers , who are , or at least assume the title of , Heroic Poets . He and Chaucer , among other things , had this in common , that they refined their mother tongues ; but with this difference , that Dante had begun to file their language , at least in verse , before the time of Boccace , who likewise received no little help from his master Petrarch . But the reformation of their prose was wholly owing to Boccace himself , who is yet the standard of purity in the Italian tongue ; though many of his phrases are become obsolete , as in process of time it must needs happen . Chaucer , as you have formerly been told by our learned Mr Rymer , first adorned and amplified our barren tongue from the Provençal , which was then the most polished of all the modern languages ; but this subject has been copiously treated by that great critic , who deserves no little commendation from us his countrymen . For these reasons of time , and resemblance of genius in Chaucer and Boccace , I resolved to join them in my present work ; to which I have added some original papers of my own ; which , whether they are equal or inferior to my other poems , an author is the most improper judge ; and therefore , I leave them wholly to the mercy of the reader . I will hope the best , that they will not be condemned ; but if they should , I have the excuse of an old gentleman , who , mounting on horseback before some ladies , when I was present , got up somewhat heavily , but desired of the fair spectators that they would count fourscore and eight before they judged him . By the mercy of God , I am already come within twenty years of his number , a cripple in my limbs ; but what decays are in my mind , the reader must determine . I think myself as vigorous as ever in the faculties of my soul , excepting only my memory , which is not impaired to any great degree ; and if I lose not more of it , I have no great reason to complain . What judgment I had , increases rather than diminishes ; and thoughts , such as they are , come crowding in so fast upon me , that my only difficulty is to choose or to reject ; to run them into verse , or to give them the other harmony of prose . I have so long studied and practised both , that they are grown into a habit , and become familiar to me ; in short , though I may lawfully plead some part of the old gentleman 's excuse , yet I will reserve it till I think I have greater need , and ask no grains of allowance for the faults of this my present work , but those which are given of course to human frailty . I will not trouble my reader with the shortness of time in which I writ it , or the several intervals of sickness . They who think too well of their own performances , are apt to boast in their prefaces how little time their works have cost them , and what other business of more importance interfered ; but the reader will be as apt to ask the question , why they allowed not a longer time to make their works more perfect ? and why they had so despicable an opinion of their judges , as to thrust their indigested stuff upon them , as if they deserved no better ?</p>
   <p>With this account of my present undertaking , I conclude the first part of this discourse ; in the second part , as at a second sitting , though I alter not the draught , I must touch the same features over again , and change the dead colouring of the whole . In general I will only say , that I have written nothing which savours of immorality or profaneness ; at least , I am not conscious to myself of any such intention . If there happen to be found an irreverent expression , or a thought too wanton , they are crept into my verses through my inadvertency ; if the searchers find any in the cargo , let them be staved or forfeited , like contraband goods ; at least , let their authors be answerable for them , as being but imported merchandise , and not of my own manufacture . On the other side , I have endeavoured to choose such fables , both ancient and modern , as contain in each of them some instructive moral , which I could prove by induction ; but the way is tedious , and they leap foremost into sight , without the reader 's trouble of looking after them . I wish I could affirm with a safe conscience , that I had taken the same care in all my former writings ; for it must be owned , that supposing verses are never so beautiful or pleasing , yet if they contain anything which shocks religion , or good manners , they are at best , what Horace says of good numbers without good sense , Versus inopes rerum , nugaeque canorae . Thus far , I hope , I am right in court , without renouncing my other right of self-defence , where I have been wrongfully accused , and my sense withdrawn into blasphemy or bawdry , as it has often been by a religious lawyer , in a late pleading against the stage , in which he mixes truth with falsehood , and has not forgotten the old rule of calumniating strongly , that something may remain .</p>
   <p>I resume the thread of my discourse with the first of my translation , which was the first Iliad of Homer . If it shall please God to give me longer life , and moderate health , my intentions are to translate the whole Ilias ; provided still that I meet with those encouragements from the public which may enable me to proceed in my undertaking with some cheerfulness . And this I dare assure the world beforehand , that I have found , by trial , Homer a more pleasing task than Virgil ( though I say not the translation will be less laborious ) ; for the Grecian is more according to my genius , than the Latin poet . In the works of the two authors , we may read their manners and natural inclinations , which are wholly different . Virgil was of a quiet , sedate temper ; Homer was violent , impetuous , and full of fire . The chief talent of Virgil was propriety of thoughts , and ornament of words ; Homer was rapid in his thoughts , and took all the liberties , both of numbers and of expressions , which his language , and the age in which he lived , allowed him : Homer 's invention was more copious , Virgil 's more confined ; so that if Homer had not led the way , it was not in Virgil to have begun heroic poetry ; for nothing can be more evident , than that the Roman poem is but the second part of the Ilias ; a continuation of the same story , and the persons already formed : the manners of Æneas are those of Hector superadded to those which Homer gave him . The adventures of Ulysses in the Odysseis are imitated in the first six books of Virgil 's Æneas , and though the accidents are not the same ( which would have argued him of a servile copying , and total barrenness of invention ) , yet the seas were the same in which both the heroes wandered , and Dido cannot be denied to be the poetical daughter of Calypso . The six latter books of Virgil 's poem are the four and twenty Iliads contracted ; a quarrel occasioned by a lady , a single combat , battles fought , and a town besieged . I say not this in derogation to Virgil , neither do I contradict anything which I have formerly said in his just praise , for his episodes are almost wholly of his own invention ; and the form which he has given to the telling makes the tale his own , even though the original story had been the same . But this proves , however , that Homer taught Virgil to design ; and if invention be the first virtue of an epic poet , then the Latin poem can only be allowed the second place . Mr Hobbs , in the preface to his own bald translation of the Ilias ( studying poetry as he did mathematics , when it was too late ) , Mr Hobbs , I say , begins the praise of Homer where he should have ended it . He tells us , that the first beauty of an Epic poem consists in diction , that is , in the choice of words , and harmony of numbers . Now , the words are the colouring of the work , which in the order of nature is last to be considered : the design , the disposition , the manners , and the thoughts , are all before it ; where any of those are wanting or imperfect , so much wants or is imperfect in the imitation of human life , which is in the very definition of a poem . Words indeed , like glaring colours , are the first beauties that arise , and strike the sight ; but if the draught be false or lame , the figures ill-disposed , the manners obscure or inconsistent , or the thoughts unnatural , then the finest colours are but daubing , and the piece is a beautiful monster at the best . Neither Virgil nor Homer were deficient in any of the former beauties ; but in this last , which is expression , the Roman poet is at least equal to the Grecian , as I have said elsewhere , supplying the poverty of his language by his musical ear , and by his diligence . But to return : our two great poets , being so different in their tempers , one choleric and sanguine , the other phlegmatic and melancholic ; that which makes them excel in their several ways is , that each of them has followed his own natural inclination , as well in forming the design , as in the execution of it . The very heroes show their authors ; Achilles is hot , impatient , revengeful — impiger , iracundus , inexorabilis , acer , &amp; c .: Æneas patient , considerate , careful of his people , and merciful to his enemies ; ever submissive to the will of Heaven — quò fata trahunt , retrahuntque , sequamur . I could please myself with enlarging on this subject , but am forced to defer it to a fitter time . From all I have said , I will only draw this inference , that the action of Homer being more full of vigour than that of Virgil , according to the temper of the writer , is of consequence more pleasing to the reader . One warms you by degrees ; the other sets you on fire all at once , and never intermits his heat . ‘ Tis the same difference which Longinus makes betwixt the effects of eloquence in Demosthenes and Tully — one persuades ; the other commands . You never cool while you read Homer , even not in the second book ( a graceful flattery to his countrymen ) , but he hastens from the ships , and concludes not that book till he has made you an amends by the violent playing of a new machine . From thence he hurries on his action with variety of events , and ends it in less compass than two months . This vehemence of his , I confess , is more suitable to my temper ; and therefore I have translated his first book with greater pleasure than any part of Virgil . But it was not a pleasure without pains ; the continual agitations of the spirits must needs be a weakening of any constitution , especially in age , and many pauses are required for refreshment betwixt the heats , the Iliad of itself being a third part longer than all Virgil 's works together .</p>
   <p>This is what I thought needful in this place to say of Homer . I proceed to Ovid and Chaucer ; considering the former only in relation to the latter . With Ovid ended the golden age of the Roman tongue : from Chaucer the purity of the English tongue began . The manners of the poets were not unlike : both of them were well-bred , well-natured , amorous , and libertine , at least in their writings — it may be also in their lives . Their studies were the same — philosophy and philology . Both of them were known in astronomy , of which Ovid 's books of the Roman feasts , and Chaucer 's treatise of the Astrolabe , are sufficient witnesses . But Chaucer was likewise an astrologer , as were Virgil , Horace , Persius , and Manilius . Both writ with wonderful facility and clearness : neither were great inventors ; for Ovid only copied the Grecian fables , and most of Chaucer 's stories were taken from his Italian contemporaries , or their predecessors . Boccace 's Decameron was first published ; and from thence our Englishman has borrowed many of his Canterbury tales ; yet that of Palamon and Arcite was written in all probability by some Italian wit , in a former age ; as I shall prove hereafter . The tale of Grizzild was the invention of Petrarch ; by him sent to Boccace ; from whom it came to Chaucer . Troilus and Cressida was also written by a Lombard author ; but much amplified by our English translator , as well as beautified ; the genius of our countrymen in general being rather to improve an invention , than to invent themselves ; as is evident not only in our poetry , but in many of our manufactures . I find I have anticipated already , and taken up from Boccace before I come to him ; but there is so much less behind ; and I am of the temper of most kings , who love to be in debt , are all for present money , no matter how they pay it afterwards : besides , the nature of a preface is rambling ; never wholly out of the way , nor in it . This I have learned from the practice of honest Montaign , and return at my pleasure to Ovid and Chaucer , of whom I have little more to say . Both of them built on the inventions of other men ; yet since Chancer had something of his own , as the Wife of Bath 's Tale the Cock and the Fox , which I have translated , and some others , I may justly give our countryman the precedence in that part ; since I can remember nothing of Ovid which was wholly his . Both of them understood the manners , under which name I comprehend the passions , and , in a larger sense the descriptions of persons , and their very habits : for an example , I see Baucis and Philemon as perfectly before me , as if some ancient painter had drawn them ; and all the pilgrims in the Canterbury tales , their humours , their features , and the very dress , as distinctly as if I had supped with them at the Tabard in Southwark : yet even there too the figures in Chaucer are much more lively , and set in a better light ; which though I have not time to prove , yet I appeal to the reader , and am sure he will clear me from partiality . The thoughts and words remain to be considered in the comparison of the two poets ; and I have saved myself one half of that labour , by owning that Ovid lived when the Roman tongue was in its meridian ; Chaucer , in the dawning of our language : therefore that part of the comparison stands not on an equal foot , any more than the diction of Ennius and Ovid ; or of Chaucer and our present English . The words are given up as a post not to be defended in our poet , because he wanted the modern art of fortifying . The thoughts remain to be considered ; and they are to be measured only by their propriety ; that is , as they flow more or less naturally from the persons described , on such and such occasions . The vulgar judges , which are nine parts in ten of all nations , who call conceits and jingles wit , who see Ovid full of them , and Chaucer altogether without them , will think me little less than mad for preferring the Englishman to the Roman ; yet , with their leave , I must presume to say , that the things they admire are only glittering trifles , and so far from being witty , that in a serious poem they are nauseous , because they are unnatural . Would any man , who is ready to die for love , describe his passion like Narcissus ? Would he think of inopem me copia fecit , and a dozen more of such expressions , poured on the neck of one another , and signifying all the same thing ? If this were wit , was this a time to be witty , when the poor wretch was in the agony of death ? This is just John Littlewit in Bartholomew Fair , who had a conceit ( as he tells you ) left him in his misery ; a miserable conceit . On these occasions the poet should endeavour to raise pity ; but instead of this , Ovid is tickling you to laugh . Virgil never made use of such machines , when he was moving you to commiserate the death of Dido : he would not destroy what he was building . Chaucer makes Arcite violent in his love , and unjust in the pursuit of it ; yet when he came to die , he made him think more reasonably : he repents not of his love , for that had altered his character ; but acknowledges the injustice of his proceedings , and resigns Emilia to Palamon . What would Ovid have done on this occasion ? He would certainly have made Arcite witty on his deathbed . He had complained he was farther off from possession by being so near , and a thousand such boyisms , which Chaucer rejected as below the dignity of the subject . They who think otherwise would , by the same reason , prefer Lucan and Ovid to Homer and Virgil , and Martial to all four of them . As for the turn of words , in which Ovid particularly excels all poets , they are sometimes a fault , and sometimes a beauty , as they are used properly or improperly ; but in strong passions always to be shunned , because passions are serious , and will admit no playing . The French have a high value for them ; and I confess , they are often what they call delicate , when they are introduced with judgment ; but Chaucer writ with more simplicity , and followed nature more closely , than to use them . I have thus far , to the best of my knowledge , been an upright judge betwixt the parties in competition , not meddling with the design nor the disposition of it ; because the design was not their own , and in the disposing of it they were eqaal . It remains that I say somewhat of Chaucer in particular .</p>
   <p>In the first place , as he is the father of English poetry , so I hold him in the same degree of veneration as the Grecians held Homer , or the Romans Virgil . He is a perpetual fountain of good sense ; learned in all sciences , and therefore speaks properly on all subjects ; as he knew what to say , so he knows also when to leave off — a continence which is practised by few writers , and scarcely by any of the ancients , excepting Virgil and Horace . One of our late great poets is sunk in his reputation , because he could never forgive any conceit which came in his way ; but swept like a drag-net , great and small . There was plenty enough , but the dishes were ill-sorted ; whole pyramids of sweetmeats , for boys and women ; but little of solid meat , for men . All this proceeded not from any want of knowledge , but of judgment ; neither did he want that in discerning the beauties and faults of other poets ; but only indulged himself in the luxury of writing ; and perhaps knew it was a fault , but hoped the reader would not find it . For this reason , though he must always be thought a great poet , he is no longer esteemed a good writer ; and for ten impressions , which his works have had in so many successive years , yet at present a hundred books are scarcely purchased once a twelvemonth : for , as my last Lord Rochester said , though somewhat profanely , not being of God , he could not stand .</p>
   <p>Chaucer followed nature everywhere ; but was never so bold to go beyond her : and there is a great difference of being Poeta and nimis Poeta , if we believe Catullus , as much as betwixt a modest behaviour and affectation . The verse of Chaucer , I confess , is not harmonious to us ; but it is like the eloquence of one whom Tacitus commends , it was auribus istius temporis accommodata . They who lived with him , and some time after him , thought it musical ; and it continues so even in our judgment , if compared with the numbers of Lidgate and Gower , his contemporaries : there is the rude sweetness of a Scotch tune in it , which is natural and pleasing , though not perfect . It is true , I cannot go so far as he who published the last edition of him ; for he would make us believe the fault is in our ears , and that there were really ten syllables in a verse where we find but nine . But this opinion is not worth confuting ; it is so gross and obvious an error , that common sense ( which is a rule in every thing but matters of faith and revelation ) must convince the reader , that equality of numbers in every verse which we call Heroic , was either not known , or not always practised in Chaucer 's age . It were an easy matter to produce some thousands of his verses , which are lame for want of half a foot , and sometimes a whole one , and which no pronunciation can make otherwise . We can only say , that he lived in the infancy of our poetry , and that nothing is brought to perfection at the first . We must be children before we grow men . There was an Ennius , and in process of time a Lucilius , and a Lucretius , before Virgil and Horace ; even after Chaucer there was a Spenser , a Harrington , a Fairfax , before Waller and Denham were in being ; and our numbers were in their nonage till these last appeared . I need say little of his parentage , life and fortunes : they are to be found at large in all the editions of his works . He was employed abroad and favoured by Edward the Third , Richard the Second , and Henry the Fourth , and was poet , as I suppose , to all three of them . In Richard 's time , I doubt , he was a little dipt in the rebellion of the commons ; and being brother-in-law to John of Gaunt , it was no wonder if he followed the fortunes of that family ; and was well with Henry the Fourth when he had deposed his predecessor . Neither is it to be admired , that Henry , who was a wise as well as a valiant prince , who claimed by succession , and was sensible that his title was not sound , but was rightfully in Mortimer , who had married the heir of York ; it was not to be admired , I say , if that great politician should be pleased to have the greatest wit of those times in his interests , and to be the trumpet of his praises . Augustus had given him the example , by the advice of Maecenas , who recommended Virgil and Horace to him ; whose praises helped to make him popular while he was alive , and after his death have made him precious to posterity . As for the religion of our poet , he seems to have some little bias towards the opinions of Wickliff , after John of Gaunt his patron ; somewhat of which appears in the tale of Piers Plowman : yet I cannot blame him for inveighing so sharply against the vices of the clergy in his age : their pride , their ambition , their pomp , their avarice , their worldly interest , deserved the lashes which he gave them , both in that , and in most of his Canterbury tales : neither has his contemporary Boccace spared them . Yet both those poets lived in much esteem with good and holy men in orders ; for the scandal which is given by particular priests , reflects not on the sacred function . Chaucer 's Monk , his Chanon , and his Fryer , took not from the character of his Good Parson . A satirical poet is the check of the laymen on bad priests . We are only to take care , that we involve not the innocent with the guilty in the same condemnation . The good cannot be too much honoured , nor the bad too coarsely used ; for the corruption of the best becomes the worst . When a clergyman is whipped , his gown is first taken off , by which the dignity of his order is secured : if he be wrongfully accused , he has his action of slander ; and it is at the poet 's peril , if he transgress the law . But they will tell us , that all kind of satire , though never so well deserved by particular priests , yet brings the whole order into contempt . Is then the peerage of England anything dishonoured , when a peer suffers for his treason ? If he be libelled , or any way defamed , he has his Scandalum Magnatum to punish the offender . They who use this kind of argument , seem to be conscious to themselves of somewhat which has deserved the poet 's lash ; and are less concerned for their public capacity , than for their private ; at least there is pride at the bottom of their reasoning . If the faults of men in orders are only to be judged among themselves , they are all in some sort parties ; for , since they say the honour of their order is concerned in every member of it , how can we be sure that they will be impartial judges ? How far I may be allowed to speak my opinion in this case , I know not ; but I am sure a dispute of this nature caused mischief in abundance betwixt a king of England and an archbishop of Canterbury ; one standing up for the laws of his land , and the other for the honour ( as he called it ) of God 's Church ; which ended in the murder of the prelate , and in the whipping of his majesty from post to pillar for his penance . The learned and ingenious Dr Drake has saved me the labour of inquiring into the esteem and reverence which the priests have , had of old ; and I would rather extend than diminish any part of it ; yet I must needs say , that when a priest provokes me without any occasion given him , I have no reason , unless it be the charity of a Christian , to forgive him . Prior laesit is justification sufficient in the civil law . If I answer him in his own language , self-defence , I am sure , must be allowed me ; and if I carry it farther , even to a sharp recrimination , somewhat may be indulged to human frailty . Yet my resentment has not wrought as far , but that I have followed Chaucer in his character of a holy man , and have enlarged on that subject with some pleasure , reserving to myself the right , if I shall think fit hereafter , to describe another sort of priests , such as are more easily to be found than the Good Parson ; such as have given the last blow to Christianity in this age , by a practice so contrary to their doctrine . But this will keep cold till another time . In the mean while , I take up Chaucer where I left him . He must have been a man of a most wonderful comprehensive nature , because , as it has been truly observed of him , he has taken into the compass of his Canterbury tales the various manners and humours ( as we now call them ) of the whole English nation , in his age . Not a single character has escaped him . All his pilgrims are severally distinguished from each other ; and not only in their inclinations , but in their very physiognomies and persons . Baptista Porta could not have described their natures better , than by the marks which the poet gives them . The matter and manner of their tales , and of their telling , are so suited to their different edncations , humours , and callings , that each of them would be improper in any other mouth . Even the grave and serious characters are distinguished by their several sorts of gravity : their discourses are such as belong to their age , their calling , and their breeding ; such as are becoming of them , and of them only . Some of his persons are vicious , and some virtuous ; some are unlearned , or ( as Chaucer calls them ) lewd , and some are learned . Even the ribaldry of the low characters is different . The Reeve , the Miller , and the Cook , are several men , and distinguished from each other , as much as the mincing Lady Prioress , and the broad-speaking gap-toothed Wife of Bath . But enough of this : there is such a variety of game springing up before me , that I am distracted in my choice , and know not which to follow . ‘ Tis sufficient to say , according to the proverb , that here is God 's plenty . We have our forefathers and great-granddames all before us , as they were in Chaucer 's days : their general characters are still remaining in mankind , and even in England , though they are called by other names than those of monks and friars , and chanons , and lady abbesses , and nuns : for mankind is ever the same , and nothing lost out of nature , though every thing is altered . May I have leave to do myself the justice , ( since my enemies will do me none , and are so far from granting me to be a good poet , that they will not allow me so much as to be a Christian , or a moral man ) ; may I have leave , I say , to inform my reader , that I have confined my choice to such tales of Chaucer as savour nothing of immodesty . If I had desired more to please than to instruct , the Reeve , the Miller , the Shipman , the Merchants , the Sumner , and above all the Wife of Bath , in the prologue to her tale , would have procured me as many friends and readers as there are beaux and ladies of pleasure in the town . But I will no more offend against good manners . I am sensible , as I ought to be , of the scandal I have given by my loose writings ; and make what reparation I am able by this public acknowledgment . If any thing of this nature , or of profaneness , be crept into these poems , I am so far from defending it , that I disown it . Totum hoc indicium volo . Chaucer makes another manner of apology for his broad-speaking , and Boccace makes the like ; but I will follow neither of them . Our countryman , in the end of his characters , before the Canterbury tales , thus excuses the ribaldry , which is very gross in many of his novels .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Yet , if a man should have inquired of Boccace or of Chaucer what need they had of introducing such characters , where obscene words were proper in their mouths , but very indecent to be heard ,— I know not what answer they could have made ; for that reason , such tale shall be left untold by me . You have here a specimen of Chaucer 's language , which is so obsolete , that his sense is scarce to be understood ; and you have likewise more than one example of his unequal numbers , which were mentioned before . Yet many of his verses consist of ten syllables , and the words not much behind our present English ; as , for example , these two lines in the description of the carpenter 's young wife :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Wincing she was , as is a jolly colt ,</l>
     <l n="2">Long as a mast , and upright as a bolt . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I have almost done with Chaucer when I have answered some objections relating to my present work . I find some people are offended that I have turned these tales into modern English , because they think them unworthy of my pains , and look on Chaucer as a dry , old-fashioned wit not worth reviving . I have often heard the late Earl of Leicester say that Mr Cowley himself was of that opinion , who , having read him over at my lord 's request declared he had no taste of him . I dare not advance my opinion against the judgment of so great an author , but I think it fair , however , to leave the decision to the public . Mr Cowley was too modest to set up for a dictator , and being shocked , perhaps , with his old style , never examined into the depth of his good sense . Chaucer , I confess , is a rough diamond , and must first be polished ere he shines . I deny not , likewise , that , living in our early days of poetry , he writes not always of a piece , but sometimes mingles trivial things with those of greater moment . Sometimes also , though not often , he runs riot , like Ovid , and knows not when he has said enough . But there are more great wits besides Chaucer , whose fault is their excess of conceits , and those ill sorted . An author is not to write all he can , but only all he ought . Having observed this redundancy in Chaucer ( as it is an easy matter for a man of ordinary parts to find a fault in one of greater ) , I have not tied myself to a literal translation , but have often omitted what I judged unnecessary , or not of dignity enough to appear in the company of better thoughts . I have presumed farther , in some places , and added somewhat of my own where I thought my author was deficient , and had not given his thoughts their true lustre , for want of words in the beginning of our language . And to this I was the more emboldened , because ( if I may be permitted to say it of myself ) I found I had a soul congenial to his , and that I had been conversant in the same studies . Another poet , in another age , may take the same liberty with my writings , if , at least , they live long enough to deserve correction . It was also necessary sometimes to restore the sense of Chaucer , which was lost or mangled in the errors of the press . Let this example suffice at present . In the story of Palamon and Arcite , where the temple of Diana is described , you find these verses in all the editions of our author :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ There saw I Danè turned into a tree ,</l>
     <l n="2">I mean not the goddess Diane ,</l>
     <l n="3">But Venus ’ daughter , which that hight Danè : ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Which , after a little consideration , I knew was to be reformed into this sense , that Daphne , the daughter of Peneus , was turned into a tree . I durst not make thus bold with Ovid , lest some future Milbourn should arise , and say I varied from my author because I understood him not .</p>
   <p>But there are other judges who think I ought not to have translated Chaucer into English , out of a quite contrary notion . They suppose there is a certain veneration due to his old language , and that it is little less than profanation and sacrilege to alter it . They are farther of opinion , that somewhat of his good sense will suffer in this transfusion , and much of the beauty of his thoughts will infallibly be lost , which appear with more grace in their old habit . Of this opinion was that excellent person whom I mentioned , the late Earl of Leicester , who valued Chaucer as much as Mr Cowley despised him . My lord dissuaded me from this attempt ( for I was thinking of it some years before his death ) , and his authority prevailed so far with me , as to defer my undertaking while he lived , in deference to him ; yet my reason was not convinced with what he urged against it . If the first end of a writer be to be understood , then , as his language grows obsolete , his thoughts must grow obscure : multa renascentur quæ nunc cecidere , cadentque , quæ nunc sunt in honore vocabula , si volet usus , quem penes arbitrium est et jus et norma loquendi . When an ancient word for its sound and significancy deserves to be revived , I have that reasonable veneration for antiquity to restore it . All beyond this is superstition . Words are not like landmarks , so sacred as never to be removed ; customs are changed , and even statutes are silently repealed , when the reason ceases for which they were enacted . As for the other part of the argument , that his thoughts will lose their original beauty by the innovation of words ; in the first place , not only their beauty , but their being is lost , where they are no longer understood , which is the present case . I grant that something must be lost in all transfusion , that is , in all translations ; but the sense will remain , which would otherwise be lost , or at least be maimed , when it is scarce intelligible , and that but to a few . How few are there who can read Chaucer , so as to understand him perfectly ! And if imperfectly , then with less profit and no pleasure . ‘ Tis not for the use of some old Saxon friends that I have taken these pains with him : let them neglect my version , because they have no need of it . I made it for their sakes who understand sense and poetry as well as they , when that poetry and sense is put into words which they understand . I will go further , and dare to add , that what beauties I lose in some places , I give to others which had them not originally ; but in this I may be partial to myself ; let the reader judge , and I submit to his decision . Yet I think I have just occasion to complain of them , who , because they understand Chaucer , would deprive the greater part of their countrymen of the same advantage , and hoard him up , as misers do their grandam , gold , only to look on it themselves , and hinder others from making use of it . In sum , I seriously protest that no man ever had , or can have , a greater veneration for Chaucer than myself . I have translated some part of his works , only that I might perpetuate his memory , or at least refresh it , amongst my countrymen . If I have altered him anywhere for the better , I must at the same time acknowledge that I could have done nothing without him : Facile est inventis addere is no great commendation , and I am not so vain to think I have deserved a greater . I will conclude what I have to say of him singly , with this one remark : a lady of my acquaintance , who keeps a kind of correspondence with some authors of the fair sex in France , has been informed by them that Mademoiselle de Scudery , who is as old as Sibyl , and inspired like her by the same god of poetry , is at this time translating Chaucer into modern French ; from which I gather that he has been formerly translated into the old Provençal , ( for how she should come to understand old English I know not ) . But the matter of fact being true , it makes me think that there is something in it like fatality ; that , after certain periods of time , the fame and memory of great wits should be renewed , as Chaucer is both in France and England . If this be wholly chance , ‘ tis extraordinary , and I dare not call it more for fear of being taxed with superstition .</p>
   <p>Boccace comes last to be considered , who , living in the same age with Chaucer , had the same genius , and followed the same studies . Both writ novels , and each of them cultivated his mother tongue . But the greatest resemblance of our two modern authors being in their familiar style , and pleasing way of relating comical adventures , I may pass it over , because I have translated nothing from Boccace of that nature . In the serious part of poetry , the advantage is wholly on Chaucer 's side ; for though the Englishman has borrowed many tales from the Italian , yet it appears that those of Boccace were not generally of his own making , but taken from authors of former ages , and by him only modelled ; so that what there was of invention in either of them may be judged equal . But Chaucer has refined on Boccace , and has mended the stories which he has borrowed , in his way of telling ; though prose allows more liberty of thought , and the expression is more easy when unconfined by numbers . Our countryman carries weight , and yet wins the race at disadvantage . I desire not the reader should take my word , and , therefore , I will set two of their discourses on the same subject , in the same light , for every man to judge betwixt them . I translated Chaucer first , and , amongst the rest , pitched on the Wife of Bath 's tale , not daring , as I have said , to adventure on her prologue , because it is too licentious . There Chaucer introduces an old woman of mean parentage , whom a youthful knight of noble blood was forced to marry , and consequently loathed her . The crone being in bed with him on the wedding night , and finding his aversion , endeavours to win his affection by reason , and speaks a good word for herself , ( as who could blame her ? ) in hope to mollify the sullen bridegroom . She takes her topics from the benefits of poverty , the advantages of old age and ugliness , the vanity of youth , and the silly pride of ancestry and titles without inherent virtue , which is the true nobility . When I had closed Chaucer I returned to Ovid and translated some more of his fables , and by this time had so far forgotten the Wife of Bath 's tale , that , when I took up Boccace , unawares I fell on the same argument of preferring virtue to nobility of blood and titles , in the story of Sigismunda , which I had certainly avoided for the resemblance of the two discourses , if my memory had not failed me . Let the reader weigh them both , and if he thinks me partial to Chaucer , it is in him to right Boccace .</p>
   <p>I prefer in our countryman , far above all his other stories , the noble poem of Palamon and Arcite , which is of the Epic kind , and perhaps not much inferior to the Ilias , or the Æneis . The story is more pleasing than either of them , the manners as perfect , the diction as poetical , the learning as deep and various , and the disposition full as artful ,— only it includes a greater length of time , as taking up seven years at least ; but Aristotle has left undecided the duration of the action , which , yet , is easily reduced into the compass of a year by a narration of what preceded the return of Palamon to Athens . I had thought , for the honour of our nation , and more particularly for his , whose laurel , though unworthy , I have worn after him , that this story was of English growth , and Chaucer 's own ; but I was undeceived by Boccace , for , casually looking on the end of his seventh Giornata , I found Dioneo ( under which name he shadows himself ) and Fiametta ( who represents his mistress , the natural daughter of Robert king of Naples ) of whom these words are spoken : Dioneo e la Fiametta granpezza contarono insieme d'Arcita e di Palamone : by which it appears that this story was written before the time of Boccace , but the name of its author being wholly lost , Chaucer is now become an original , and I question not but the poem has received many beauties by passing through his noble hands . Besides this tale , there is another of his own invention , after the manner of the Provençals , called “ The Flower and the Leaf , ” with which I was so particularly pleased , both for the invention and the moral , that I cannot hinder myself from recommending it to the reader .</p>
   <p>As a corollary to this preface , in which I have done justice to others , I owe somewhat to myself : not that I think it worth my time to enter the lists with one Milbourn , and one Blackmore , but barely to take notice , that such men there are , who have written scurrilously against me without any provocation . Milbourn , who is in orders , pretends , amongst the rest , this quarrel to me , that I have fallen foul on priesthood . If I have , I am only to ask pardon of good priests , and am afraid his part of the reparation will come to little . Let him be satisfied that he shall not be able to force himself upon me for an adversary . I contemn him too much to enter into competition with him . His own translations of Virgil have answered his criticisms on mine . If ( as they say he has declared in print ) he prefers the version of Ogilby to mine , the world has made him the same compliment : for it is agreed on all hands that he writes even below Ogilby : that , you will say , is not easily to be done ; but what cannot Milbourn bring about ? I am satisfied , however , that while he and I live together , I shall not be thought the worst poet of the age . It looks as if I had desired him underhand to write so ill against me ; but upon my honest word I have not bribed him to do me this service , and am wholly guiltless of his pamphlet . ‘ Tis true , I should be glad , if I could persuade him to continue his good offices , and write such another critique on any thing of mine ; for I find by experience he has a great stroke with the reader , when he condemns any of my poems , to make the world have a better opinion of them . He has taken some pains with my poetry ; but nobody will be persuaded to take the same with his . If I had taken to the church ( as he affirms , but which was never in my thoughts ) , I should have had more sense , if not more grace , than to have turned myself out of my benefice by writing libels on my parishioners . But his account of my manners and my principles are of a piece with his cavils and his poetry ; and so I have done with him for ever .</p>
   <p>As for the City Bard , or Knight Physician , I hear his quarrel to me is , that I was the author of Absalom and Achitophel , which he thinks is a little hard on his fanatic patrons in London .</p>
   <p>But I will deal the more civilly with his two poems , because nothing ill is to be spoken of the dead ; and therefore peace be to the manes of his Arthurs ! I will only say , that it was not for this noble knight that I drew the plan of an Epic poem on King Arthur , in my preface to the translation of Juvenal . The guardian angels of kingdoms were machines too ponderous for him to manage ; and therefore he rejected them , as Dares did the whirlbats of Eryx , when they were thrown before him by Entellus . Yet from that preface he plainly took his hint ; for he began immediately upon the story , though he had the baseness not to acknowledge his benefactor , but instead of it , to traduce me in a libel .</p>
   <p>I shall say the less of Mr Collier , because in many things he has taxed me justly ; and I have pleaded guilty to all thoughts and expressions of mine , which can be truly argued of obscenity , profaneness , or immorality ; and retract them . If he be my enemy , let him triumph ; if he be my friend , as I have given him no personal occasion to be otherwise , he will be glad of my repentance . It becomes me not to draw my pen in the defence of a bad cause , when I have so often drawn it for a good one . Yet it were not difficult to prove , that in many places he has perverted my meaning by his glosses ; and interpreted my words into blasphemy and bawdry , of which they were not guilty ; besides that he is too much given to horse-play in his raillery ; and comes to battle like a dictator from the plough . I will not say , the zeal of God 's house has eaten him up ; but I am sure it has devoured some part of his good-manners and civility . It might also be doubted whether it were altogether zeal which prompted him to this rough manner of proceeding : perhaps it became not one of his function to rake into the rubbish of ancient and modern plays : a divine might have employed his pains to better purpose than in the nastiness of Plautus and Aristophanes ; whose examples , as they excuse not me , so it might be possibly supposed that he read them not without some pleasure . They who have written commentaries on those poets , or on Horace , Juvenal , and Martial , have explained some vices , which without their interpretation had been unknown to modern times . Neither has he judged impartially betwixt the former age and us .</p>
   <p>There is more bawdry in one play of Fletcher 's , called “ The Custom of the Country , ” than in all ours together . Yet this has been often acted on the stage in my remembrance . Are the times so much more reformed now , than they were five-and-twenty years ago ? If they are , I congratulate the amendment of our morals . But I am not to prejudice the cause of my fellow-poets , though I abandon my own defence . They have some of them answered for themselves , and neither they nor I can think Mr Collier so formidable an enemy that we should shun him . He has lost ground at the latter end of the day , by pursuing his point too far , like the Prince of Conde at the battle of Senneffe : from immoral plays , to no plays ; ab abusu ad usum non valet consequentia . But being a party , I am not to erect myself into a judge . As for the rest of those who have written against me , they are such scoundrels , that they deserve not the least notice to be taken of them . Blackmore and Milbourn are only distinguished from the crowd , by being remembered to their infamy .</p>

    <p>OR , THE KNIGHT 'S TALE .</p>
    <p>BOOK I .</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In days of old , there lived , of mighty fame ,</l>
     <l n="2">A valiant prince , and Theseus was his name :</l>
     <l n="3">A chief , who more in feats of arms excell 'd ,</l>
     <l n="4">The rising nor the setting sun beheld .</l>
     <l n="5">Of Athens he was lord ; much land he won ,</l>
     <l n="6">And added foreign countries to his crown .</l>
     <l n="7">In Scythia with the warrior queen he strove ,</l>
     <l n="8">Whom first by force he conquer 'd , then by love ;</l>
     <l n="9">He brought in triumph back the beauteous dame ,</l>
     <l n="10">With whom her sister , fair Emilia , came . 10</l>
     <l n="11">With honour to his home let Theseus ride ,</l>
     <l n="12">With love to friend , and fortune for his guide ,</l>
     <l n="13">And his victorious army at his side .</l>
     <l n="14">I pass their warlike pomp , their proud array ,</l>
     <l n="15">Their shouts , their songs , their welcome on the way .</l>
     <l n="16">But , were it not too long , I would recite</l>
     <l n="17">The feats of Amazons , the fatal fight</l>
     <l n="18">Betwixt the hardy queen and hero knight ;</l>
     <l n="19">The town besieged , and how much blood it cost</l>
     <l n="20">The female army , and the Athenian host ; 20</l>
     <l n="21">The spousals of Hippolita the queen ;</l>
     <l n="22">What tilts and tourneys at the feast were seen ;</l>
     <l n="23">The storm at their return , the ladies ’ fear :</l>
     <l n="24">But these , and other things , I must forbear .</l>
     <l n="25">The field is spacious I design to sow ,</l>
     <l n="26">With oxen far unfit to draw the plough :</l>
     <l n="27">The remnant of my tale is of a length</l>
     <l n="28">To tire your patience , and to waste my strength ;</l>
     <l n="29">And trivial accidents shall be forborne ,</l>
     <l n="30">That others may have time to take their turn ; 30</l>
     <l n="31">As was at first enjoin 'd us by mine host :</l>
     <l n="32">That he whose tale is best , and pleases most ,</l>
     <l n="33">Should win his supper at our common cost .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="34">And therefore where I left , I will pursue</l>
     <l n="35">This ancient story , whether false or true ,</l>
     <l n="36">In hope it may be mended with a new .</l>
     <l n="37">The prince I mention 'd , full of high renown ,</l>
     <l n="38">In this array drew near the Athenian town ;</l>
     <l n="39">When in his pomp and utmost of his pride ,</l>
     <l n="40">Marching he chanced to cast his eye aside , 40</l>
     <l n="41">And saw a choir of mourning dames , who lay</l>
     <l n="42">By two and two across the common way :</l>
     <l n="43">At his approach they raised a rueful cry ,</l>
     <l n="44">And beat their breasts , and held their hands on high ,</l>
     <l n="45">Creeping and crying , till they seized at last</l>
     <l n="46">His courser 's bridle , and his feet embraced .</l>
     <l n="47">Tell me , said Theseus , what and whence you are ,</l>
     <l n="48">And why this funeral pageant you prepare ?</l>
     <l n="49">Is this the welcome of my worthy deeds ,</l>
     <l n="50">To meet my triumph in ill-omen 'd weeds ? 50</l>
     <l n="51">Or envy you my praise , and would destroy</l>
     <l n="52">With grief my pleasures , and pollute my joy ?</l>
     <l n="53">Or are you injured , and demand relief ?</l>
     <l n="54">Name your request , and I will ease your grief .</l>

     <l n="55">The most in years of all the mourning train</l>

     <l n="59">‘ Tis thine , O king , the afflicted to redress ,</l>
     <l n="60">And fame has fill 'd the world with thy success : 60</l>

     <l n="62">Which of thy goodness is refused to none ;</l>
     <l n="63">Let fall some drops of pity on our grief ,</l>
     <l n="64">If what we beg be just , and we deserve relief :</l>
     <l n="65">For none of us , who now thy grace implore ,</l>
     <l n="66">But held the rank of sovereign queen before ;</l>
     <l n="67">Till , thanks to giddy chance , which never bears ,</l>
     <l n="68">That mortal bliss should last for length of years ,</l>
     <l n="69">She cast us headlong from our high estate ,</l>
     <l n="70">And here in hope of thy return we wait : 70</l>
     <l n="71">And long have waited in the temple nigh ,</l>
     <l n="72">Built to the gracious goddess Clemency .</l>
     <l n="73">But reverence thou the Power whose name it bears ,</l>
     <l n="74">Relieve the oppress 'd , and wipe the widow 's tears .</l>
     <l n="75">I , wretched I , have other fortune seen ,</l>
     <l n="76">The wife of Capaneus , and once a queen :</l>
     <l n="77">At Thebes he fell ; cursed be the fatal day !</l>
     <l n="78">And all the rest thou seest in this array ,</l>
     <l n="79">To make their moan , their lords in battle lost</l>
     <l n="80">Before that town besieged by our confederate host : 80</l>
     <l n="81">But Creon , old and impious , who commands</l>
     <l n="82">The Theban city , and usurps the lands ,</l>
     <l n="83">Denies the rites of funeral fires to those</l>
     <l n="84">Whose breathless bodies yet he calls his foes .</l>
     <l n="85">Unburn 'd , unburied , on a heap they lie ;</l>
     <l n="86">Such is their fate , and such his tyranny ;</l>
     <l n="87">No friend has leave to bear away the dead ,</l>
     <l n="88">But with their lifeless limbs his hounds are fed .</l>
     <l n="89">At this she shriek 'd aloud ; the mournful train</l>
     <l n="90">Echoed her grief , and grovelling on the plain , 90</l>
     <l n="91">With groans , and hands upheld , to move his mind ,</l>
     <l n="92">Besought his pity to their helpless kind !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="93">The prince was touch 'd , his tears began to flow ,</l>
     <l n="94">And , as his tender heart would break in two ,</l>
     <l n="95">He sigh 'd , and could not but their fate deplore ,</l>
     <l n="96">So wretched now , so fortunate before .</l>
     <l n="97">Then lightly from his lofty steed he flew ,</l>
     <l n="98">And , raising one by one the suppliant crew ,</l>
     <l n="99">To comfort each full solemnly he swore ,</l>
     <l n="100">That by the faith which knights to knighthood bore , 100</l>
     <l n="101">And whate'er else to chivalry belongs ,</l>

     <l n="103">That Greece should see perform 'd what he declared ;</l>
     <l n="104">And cruel Creon find his just reward .</l>
     <l n="105">He said no more , but , shunning all delay ,</l>
     <l n="106">Rode on ; nor enter 'd Athens on his way :</l>
     <l n="107">But left his sister and his queen behind ,</l>
     <l n="108">And waved his royal banner in the wind :</l>
     <l n="109">Where in an argent field the god of war</l>
     <l n="110">Was drawn triumphant on his iron car ; 110</l>
     <l n="111">Red was his sword , and shield , and whole attire ,</l>
     <l n="112">And all the godhead seem 'd to glow with fire ;</l>
     <l n="113">Even the ground glitter 'd where the standard flew ,</l>
     <l n="114">And the green grass was dyed to sanguine hue .</l>
     <l n="115">High on his pointed lance his pennon bore</l>
     <l n="116">His Cretan fight , the conquer 'd Minotaur :</l>
     <l n="117">The soldiers shout around with generous rage ,</l>
     <l n="118">And in that victory their own presage .</l>
     <l n="119">He praised their ardour : inly pleased to see</l>
     <l n="120">His host the flower of Grecian chivalry , 120</l>
     <l n="121">All day he march 'd , and all the ensuing night ,</l>
     <l n="122">And saw the city with returning light .</l>
     <l n="123">The process of the war I need not tell ,</l>

     <l n="251">Nor of my bonds , said Palamon again ,</l>

     <l n="254">That moment I was hurt through either eye ;</l>
     <l n="255">Pierced with a random shaft , I faint away ,</l>

     <l n="257">A glance of some new goddess gave the wound ,</l>
     <l n="258">Whom , like Actaeon , unaware I found .</l>

     <l n="273">And deep within his heart infix 'd the wound :</l>
     <l n="274">So that if Palamon were wounded sore ,</l>
     <l n="275">Arcite was hurt as much as he , or more :</l>
     <l n="276">Then from his inmost soul he sigh 'd , and said ,</l>

     <l n="278">Unknowingly she strikes ; and kills by chance ;</l>
     <l n="279">Poison is in her eyes , and death in every glance .</l>
     <l n="280">Oh , I must ask ; nor ask alone , but move 280</l>
     <l n="281">Her mind to mercy , or must die for love !</l>
     <l n="282">Thus Arcite : and thus Palamon replies ,</l>

     <l n="285">Jesting , said Arcite , suits but ill with pain .</l>
     <l n="286">It suits far worse ( said Palamon again ,</l>

     <l n="288">Their faith to break , their friendship to betray ;</l>
     <l n="289">But worst with thee , of noble lineage born ,</l>
     <l n="290">My kinsman , and in arms my brother sworn . 290</l>
     <l n="291">Have we not plighted each our holy oath ,</l>
     <l n="292">That one should be the common good of both ;</l>

     <l n="294">His fellow 's hindrance in pursuit of love ?</l>
     <l n="295">To this before the gods we gave our hands ,</l>
     <l n="296">And nothing but our death can break the bands .</l>
     <l n="297">This binds thee , then , to further my design ,</l>

     <l n="304">Much rather than release would choose to die ?</l>
     <l n="305">But thou , false Arcite , never shall obtain</l>
     <l n="306">Thy bad pretence ; I told thee first my pain ;</l>
     <l n="307">For first my love began ere thine was born :</l>
     <l n="308">Thou as my council , and my brother sworn ,</l>
     <l n="309">Art bound to assist my eldership of right ,</l>

     <l n="314">I first return , and then disprove thy claim .</l>
     <l n="315">If love be passion , and that passion nursed</l>
     <l n="316">With strong desires , I loved the lady first .</l>
     <l n="317">Canst thou pretend desire , whom zeal inflamed</l>
     <l n="318">To worship , and a power celestial named ?</l>
     <l n="319">Thine was devotion to the blest above ,</l>
     <l n="320">I saw the woman and desired her love ; 320</l>

     <l n="324">A moment elder than my rival fire ;</l>

     <l n="326">And know'st thou not , no law is made for love ?</l>
     <l n="327">Law is to things which to free choice relate ;</l>

     <l n="329">Laws are but positive ; love 's power , we see ,</l>

     <l n="331">Each day we break the bond of human laws</l>
     <l n="332">For love , and vindicate the common cause .</l>
     <l n="333">Laws for defence of civil rights are placed ,</l>
     <l n="334">Love throws the fences down , and makes a general waste ;</l>

     <l n="336">The sweeping deluge , love , comes on , and covers all .</l>
     <l n="337">If , then , the laws of friendship I transgress ,</l>
     <l n="338">I keep the greater , while I break the less ;</l>
     <l n="339">And both are mad alike , since neither can possess .</l>
     <l n="340">Both hopeless to be ransom 'd , never more 340</l>

     <l n="598">His virtues more conspicuous might appear .</l>
     <l n="599">Thus by the general voice was Arcite praised ,</l>

     <l n="601">Among his menial servants first enroll 'd ,</l>

     <l n="604">Of his own income , and his annual rent :</l>
     <l n="605">This well employ 'd , he purchased friends and fame ,</l>
     <l n="606">But cautiously conceal 'd from whence it came .</l>
     <l n="607">Thus for three years he lived with large increase ,</l>
     <l n="608">In arms of honour , and esteem in peace ;</l>
     <l n="609">To Theseus ’ person he was ever near ;</l>
     <l n="610">And Theseus for his virtues held him dear . 610</l>

     <l n="13">Assisted by a friend , one moonless night ,</l>
     <l n="14">This Palamon from prison took his flight :</l>
     <l n="15">A pleasant beverage he prepared before</l>

     <l n="29">When to his country come , his next design</l>

     <l n="36">Till treacherous fortune caught him in the snare .</l>
     <l n="37">The morning lark , the messenger of day ,</l>
     <l n="38">Saluted in her song the morning gray ;</l>
     <l n="39">And soon the sun arose with beams so bright ,</l>
     <l n="40">That all the horizon laugh 'd to see the joyous sight : 40</l>
     <l n="41">He with his tepid rays the rose renews ,</l>
     <l n="42">And licks the drooping leaves , and dries the dews ;</l>
     <l n="43">When Arcite left his bed , resolved to pay</l>
     <l n="44">Observance to the month of merry May :</l>
     <l n="45">Forth on his fiery steed betimes he rode ,</l>
     <l n="46">That scarcely prints the turf on which he trode :</l>
     <l n="47">At ease he seem 'd , and , prancing o'er the plains ,</l>
     <l n="48">Turn 'd only to the grove his horse 's reins ,</l>
     <l n="49">The grove I named before ; and , lighted there ,</l>
     <l n="50">A woodbine garland sought to crown his hair ; 50</l>
     <l n="51">Then turn 'd his face against the rising day ,</l>

     <l n="57">When thy short reign is past , the feverish sun</l>
     <l n="58">The sultry tropic fears , and moves more slowly on .</l>
     <l n="59">So may thy tender blossoms fear no blight ,</l>
     <l n="60">Nor goats with venom 'd teeth thy tendrils bite , 60</l>

     <l n="66">Full little thought of him the gentle knight ,</l>

     <l n="71">But as it has been said of ancient years ,</l>

     <l n="73">For this the wise are ever on their guard ,</l>
     <l n="74">For , unforeseen , they say , is unprepared .</l>
     <l n="75">Uncautious Arcite thought himself alone ,</l>
     <l n="76">And less than all suspected Palamon ,</l>
     <l n="77">Who , listening , heard him , while he search 'd the grove ,</l>
     <l n="78">And loudly sung his roundelay of love :</l>
     <l n="79">But on the sudden stopp 'd , and silent stood ,</l>
     <l n="80">As lovers often muse , and change their mood ; 80</l>
     <l n="81">Now high as heaven , and then as low as hell ;</l>
     <l n="82">Now up , now down , as buckets in a well :</l>
     <l n="83">For Venus , like her day , will change her cheer ,</l>

     <l n="85">Thus Arcite having sung , with alter 'd hue</l>
     <l n="86">Sunk on the ground , and from his bosom drew</l>
     <l n="87">A desperate sigh , accusing Heaven and Fate ,</l>
     <l n="88">And angry Juno 's unrelenting hate .</l>
     <l n="89">Cursed be the day when first I did appear ;</l>
     <l n="90">Let it be blotted from the calendar , 90</l>
     <l n="91">Lest it pollute the month , and poison all the year !</l>
     <l n="92">Still will the jealous queen pursue our race ?</l>

     <l n="1">The day approach 'd when Fortune should decide</l>
     <l n="2">The important enterprise , and give the bride ;</l>
     <l n="3">For now , the rivals round the world had sought ,</l>
     <l n="4">And each his number , well appointed , brought .</l>
     <l n="5">The nations , far and near , contend in choice ,</l>
     <l n="6">And send the flower of war by public voice ;</l>
     <l n="7">That after , or before , were never known</l>
     <l n="8">Such chiefs , as each an army seem 'd alone :</l>
     <l n="9">Beside the champions , all of high degree ,</l>
     <l n="10">Who knighthood loved , and deeds of chivalry , 10</l>
     <l n="11">Throng 'd to the lists , and envied to behold</l>
     <l n="12">The names of others , not their own , enroll 'd .</l>
     <l n="13">Nor seems it strange ; for every noble knight</l>
     <l n="14">Who loves the fair , and is endued with might ,</l>
     <l n="15">In such a quarrel would be proud to fight .</l>
     <l n="16">There breathes not scarce a man on British ground</l>
     <l n="17">( An isle for love and arms of old renown 'd )</l>
     <l n="18">But would have sold his life to purchase fame ,</l>
     <l n="19">To Palamon or Arcite sent his name :</l>
     <l n="20">And had the land selected of the best , 20</l>
     <l n="21">Half had come hence , and let the world provide the rest .</l>
     <l n="22">A hundred knights with Palamon there came ,</l>
     <l n="23">Approved in fight , and men of mighty name ;</l>
     <l n="24">Their arms were several , as their nations were ,</l>
     <l n="25">But furnish 'd all alike with sword and spear .</l>
     <l n="26">Some wore coat-armour , imitating scale ;</l>
     <l n="27">And next their skins were stubborn shirts of mail .</l>
     <l n="28">Some wore a breastplate and a light jupon ,</l>
     <l n="29">Their horses clothed with rich caparison :</l>
     <l n="30">Some for defence would leathern bucklers use , 30</l>
     <l n="31">Of folded hides ; and others shields of pruce .</l>
     <l n="32">One hung a pole-axe at his saddle-bow ,</l>
     <l n="33">And one a heavy mace to stun the foe ;</l>
     <l n="34">One for his legs and knees provided well ,</l>
     <l n="35">With jambeaux arm 'd , and double plates of steel :</l>
     <l n="36">This on his helmet wore a lady 's glove ,</l>
     <l n="37">And that a sleeve embroider 'd by his love .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="38">With Palamon above the rest in place ,</l>
     <l n="39">Lycurgus came , the surly king of Thrace ;</l>
     <l n="40">Black was his beard , and manly was his face ; 40</l>
     <l n="41">The balls of his broad eyes roll 'd in his head ,</l>
     <l n="42">And glared betwixt a yellow and a red :</l>
     <l n="43">He look 'd a lion with a gloomy stare ,</l>
     <l n="44">And o'er his eyebrows hung his matted hair :</l>
     <l n="45">Big-boned , and large of limbs , with sinews strong ,</l>
     <l n="46">Broad-shoulder 'd , and his arms were round and long .</l>
     <l n="47">Four milk-white bulls ( the Thracian use of old )</l>
     <l n="48">Were yoked to draw his car of burnish 'd gold .</l>
     <l n="49">Upright he stood , and bore aloft his shield ,</l>
     <l n="50">Conspicuous from afar , and overlook 'd the field . 50</l>
     <l n="51">His surcoat was a bear-skin on his back ;</l>
     <l n="52">His hair hung long behind , and glossy raven black .</l>
     <l n="53">His ample forehead bore a coronet ,</l>
     <l n="54">With sparkling diamonds and with rubies set :</l>
     <l n="55">Ten brace , and more , of greyhounds , snowy fair ,</l>
     <l n="56">And tall as stags , ran loose , and coursed around his chair ,</l>
     <l n="57">A match for pards in flight , in grappling for the bear :</l>
     <l n="58">With golden muzzles all their mouths were bound ,</l>
     <l n="59">And collars of the same their necks surround .</l>
     <l n="60">Thus through the fields Lycurgus took his way ; 60</l>
     <l n="61">His hundred knights attend in pomp and proud array .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="62">To match this monarch , with strong Arcite came</l>
     <l n="63">Emetrius , king of Ind , a mighty name ;</l>
     <l n="64">On a bay courser , goodly to behold ,</l>
     <l n="65">The trappings of his horse adorn 'd with barbarous gold .</l>
     <l n="66">Not Mars bestrod a steed with greater grace ;</l>
     <l n="67">His surcoat o'er his arms was cloth of Thrace ,</l>
     <l n="68">Adorn 'd with pearls , all orient , round , and great ;</l>
     <l n="69">His saddle was of gold , with emeralds set ,</l>
     <l n="70">His shoulders large a mantle did attire , 70</l>
     <l n="71">With rubies thick , and sparkling as the fire :</l>
     <l n="72">His amber-colour 'd locks in ringlets run ,</l>
     <l n="73">With graceful negligence , and shone against the sun .</l>
     <l n="74">His nose was aquiline , his eyes were blue ;</l>
     <l n="75">Ruddy his lips , and fresh and fair his hue :</l>
     <l n="76">Some sprinkled freckles on his face were seen ,</l>
     <l n="77">Whose dusk set off the whiteness of the skill :</l>
     <l n="78">His awful presence did the crowd surprise ,</l>
     <l n="79">Nor durst the rash spectator meet his eyes ;</l>
     <l n="80">Eyes that confess 'd him born for kingly sway , 80</l>
     <l n="81">So fierce , they flash 'd intolerable day .</l>
     <l n="82">His age in nature 's youthful prime appear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="83">And just began to bloom his yellow beard .</l>
     <l n="84">Whene'er he spoke , his voice was heard around ,</l>
     <l n="85">Loud as a trumpet , with a silver sound ;</l>
     <l n="86">A laurel wreathed his temples , fresh and green ;</l>
     <l n="87">And myrtle sprigs , the marks of love , were mix 'd between .</l>
     <l n="88">Upon his fist he bore , for his delight ,</l>
     <l n="89">An eagle well reclaim 'd , and lily white .</l>

     <l n="90">His hundred knights attend him to the war , 90</l>
     <l n="91">All arm 'd for battle ; save their heads were bare .</l>
     <l n="92">Words and devices blazed on every shield ,</l>
     <l n="93">And pleasing was the terror of the field .</l>
     <l n="94">For kings , and dukes , and barons , you might see ,</l>
     <l n="95">Like sparkling stars , though different in degree ,</l>
     <l n="96">All for the increase of arms , and love of chivalry .</l>
     <l n="97">Before the king tame leopards led the way ,</l>
     <l n="98">And troops of lions innocently play .</l>
     <l n="99">So Bacchus through the conquer 'd Indies rode ,</l>
     <l n="100">And beasts in gambols frisk 'd before their honest god . 100</l>

     <l n="101">In this array , the war of either side</l>

     <l n="104">Rich tapestry spread the streets , and flowers the posts adorn .</l>
     <l n="105">The town was all a jubilee of feasts ;</l>

     <l n="107">Himself with open arms the kings embraced ,</l>
     <l n="108">Then all the rest in their degrees were graced .</l>
     <l n="109">No harbinger was needful for the night ,</l>
     <l n="110">For every house was proud to lodge a knight . 110</l>

     <l n="154">Thou know'st it , and I feel too much to pray .</l>
     <l n="155">So grant my suit , as I enforce my might ,</l>

     <l n="1123">Long love to her has borne the faithful knight ,</l>

     <l n="1136">Seem 'd to give Theseus what she gave the knight .</l>
     <l n="1137">Then turning to the Theban thus he said :</l>

    <head>THE COCK AND THE FOX : OR , THE TALE OF THE NUN 'S PRIEST .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">There lived , as authors tell , in days of yore ,</l>
     <l n="2">A widow somewhat old , and very poor :</l>
     <l n="3">Deep in a cell her cottage lonely stood ,</l>
     <l n="4">Well thatch 'd , and under covert of a wood .</l>
     <l n="5">This dowager , on whom my tale I found ,</l>
     <l n="6">Since last she laid her husband in the ground ,</l>
     <l n="7">A simple sober life , in patience , led ,</l>
     <l n="8">And had but just enough to buy her bread :</l>
     <l n="9">But huswifing the little Heaven had lent ,</l>
     <l n="10">She duly paid a groat for quarter rent ; 10</l>
     <l n="11">And pinch 'd her belly , with her daughters two ,</l>
     <l n="12">To bring the year about with much ado .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">The cattle in her homestead were three sows ,</l>
     <l n="14">A ewe call 'd Mally , and three brinded cows .</l>
     <l n="15">Her parlour-window stuck with herbs around ,</l>
     <l n="16">Of savoury smell ; and rushes strew 'd the ground .</l>
     <l n="17">A mapple-dresser in her hall she had ,</l>
     <l n="18">On which full many a slender meal she made ;</l>
     <l n="19">For no delicious morsel pass 'd her throat ;</l>
     <l n="20">According to her cloth she cut her coat : 20</l>
     <l n="21">No poignant sauce she knew , nor costly treat ,</l>
     <l n="22">Her hunger gave a relish to her meat :</l>
     <l n="23">A sparing diet did her health assure ;</l>
     <l n="24">Or sick , a pepper posset was her cure .</l>
     <l n="25">Before the day was done , her work she sped ,</l>
     <l n="26">And never went by candlelight to bed :</l>
     <l n="27">With exercise she sweat ill humours out ,</l>
     <l n="28">Her dancing was not hindered by the gout .</l>
     <l n="29">Her poverty was glad ; her heart content ;</l>
     <l n="30">Nor knew she what the spleen or vapours meant . 30</l>
     <l n="31">Of wine she never tasted through the year ,</l>
     <l n="32">But white and black was all her homely cheer :</l>
     <l n="33">Brown bread , and milk ( but first she skimm 'd her bowls ) ,</l>
     <l n="34">And rashers of singed bacon on the coals ;</l>
     <l n="35">On holy days , an egg or two at most ;</l>
     <l n="36">But her ambition never reach 'd to roast .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="37">A yard she had with pales enclosed about ,</l>
     <l n="38">Some high , some low , and a dry ditch without .</l>

     <l n="40">For crowing loud , the noble Chanticleer ; 40</l>
     <l n="41">So hight her cock , whose singing did surpass</l>
     <l n="42">The merry notes of organs at the mass .</l>
     <l n="43">More certain was the crowing of the cock</l>
     <l n="44">To number hours , than is an abbey-clock ;</l>
     <l n="45">And sooner than the matin-bell was rung ,</l>
     <l n="46">He clapp 'd his wings upon his roost , and sung :</l>
     <l n="47">For when degrees fifteen ascended right ,</l>
     <l n="48">By sure instinct he knew ‘ twas one at night .</l>
     <l n="49">High was his comb , and coral-red withal ,</l>
     <l n="50">In dents embattled like a castle wall ; 50</l>
     <l n="51">His bill was raven-black , and shone like jet ;</l>
     <l n="52">Blue were his legs , and orient were his feet ;</l>
     <l n="53">White were his nails , like silver to behold ,</l>
     <l n="54">His body glittering like the burnish 'd gold .</l>
     <l n="55">This gentle cock , for solace of his life ,</l>
     <l n="56">Six misses had , besides his lawful wife .</l>
     <l n="57">Scandal that spares no king , though ne'er so good ,</l>
     <l n="58">Says , they were all of his own flesh and blood ,</l>
     <l n="59">His sisters both by sire and mother 's side ;</l>
     <l n="60">And sure their likeness show 'd them near allied . 60</l>
     <l n="61">But make the worst , the monarch did no more ,</l>
     <l n="62">Than all the Ptolemys had done before :</l>
     <l n="63">When incest is for interest of a nation ,</l>
     <l n="64">‘ Tis made no sin by holy dispensation .</l>
     <l n="65">Some lines have been maintain 'd by this alone ,</l>
     <l n="66">Which by their common ugliness are known .</l>

     <l n="67">But passing this , as from our tale apart ,</l>

     <l n="71">And she , that was not only passing fair ,</l>
     <l n="72">But was with all discreet , and debonair ,</l>
     <l n="73">Resolved the passive doctrine to fulfil ,</l>
     <l n="74">Though loth ; and let him work his wicked will :</l>
     <l n="75">At board and bed was affable and kind ,</l>
     <l n="76">According as their marriage vow did bind ,</l>
     <l n="77">And as the Church 's precept had enjoin 'd .</l>
     <l n="78">Even since she was a se'ennight old , they say ,</l>
     <l n="79">Was chaste and humble to her dying day ,</l>

     <l n="81">By this her husband 's heart she did obtain ;</l>

     <l n="83">She was his only joy , and he her pride ,</l>
     <l n="84">She , when he walk 'd , went pecking by his side ;</l>
     <l n="85">If spurning up the ground , he sprung a corn ,</l>
     <l n="86">The tribute in his bill to her was borne .</l>
     <l n="87">But oh ! what joy it was to hear him sing</l>
     <l n="88">In summer , when the day began to spring ,</l>
     <l n="89">Stretching his neck , and warbling in his throat ;</l>
     <l n="90">Solus cum sola then was all his note . 90</l>
     <l n="91">For in the days of yore , the birds of parts</l>

     <l n="93">It happ 'd that , perching on the parlour-beam</l>

     <l n="119">Were black ; and much unlike his other hairs :</l>
     <l n="120">The rest , in shape a beagle 's whelp throughout , 120</l>
     <l n="121">With broader forehead , and a sharper snout :</l>

     <l n="140">All dreams , as in old Galen I have read , 140</l>
     <l n="141">Are from repletion and complexion bred ;</l>
     <l n="142">From rising fumes of indigested food ,</l>

     <l n="145">These foolish fancies you have had to-night</l>
     <l n="146">Are certain symptoms ( in the canting style )</l>
     <l n="147">Of boiling choler , and abounding bile ;</l>
     <l n="148">This yellow gall , that in your stomach floats ,</l>
     <l n="149">Engenders all these visionary thoughts .</l>
     <l n="150">When choler overflows , then dreams are bred 150</l>
     <l n="151">Of flames , and all the family of red ;</l>
     <l n="152">Red dragons , and red beasts , in sleep we view ,</l>
     <l n="153">For humours are distinguish 'd by their hue .</l>
     <l n="154">From hence we dream of wars and warlike things ,</l>

     <l n="161">The dominating humour makes the dream .</l>

     <l n="176">And for the love of heaven make no delay .</l>
     <l n="177">Since hot and dry in your complexion join ,</l>
     <l n="178">Beware the sun when in a vernal sign ;</l>
     <l n="179">For when he mounts exalted in the Ram ,</l>
     <l n="180">If then he finds your body in a flame , 180</l>
     <l n="181">Replete with choler , I dare lay a groat ,</l>

     <l n="213">It happen 'd so that , when the sun was down ,</l>

    <p>A VISION .</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Now turning from the wintry signs , the sun ,</l>
     <l n="2">His course exalted , through the Ram had run ,</l>
     <l n="3">And whirling up the skies , his chariot drove</l>
     <l n="4">Through Taurus , and the lightsome realms of love ;</l>
     <l n="5">Where Venus from her orb descends in showers ,</l>
     <l n="6">To glad the ground , and paint the fields with flowers :</l>
     <l n="7">When first the tender blades of grass appear ,</l>
     <l n="8">And buds , that yet the blast of Eurus fear ,</l>
     <l n="9">Stand at the door of life , and doubt to clothe the year :</l>
     <l n="10">Till gentle heat , and soft repeated rains , 10</l>
     <l n="11">Make the green blood to dance within their veins :</l>
     <l n="12">Then , at their call , embolden 'd out they come ,</l>
     <l n="13">And swell the gems , and burst the narrow room ;</l>
     <l n="14">Broader and broader yet , their blooms display ,</l>
     <l n="15">Salute the welcome sun , and entertain the day .</l>
     <l n="16">Then from their breathing souls the sweets repair</l>
     <l n="17">To scent the skies , and purge the unwholesome air :</l>
     <l n="18">Joy spreads the heart , and , with a general song ,</l>
     <l n="19">Spring issues out , and leads the jolly months along .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="20">In that sweet season , as in bed I lay , 20</l>
     <l n="21">And sought in sleep to pass the night away ,</l>
     <l n="22">I turn 'd my weary side , but still in vain ,</l>
     <l n="23">Though full of youthful health , and void of pain :</l>
     <l n="24">Cares I had none , to keep me from my rest ,</l>
     <l n="25">For love had never enter 'd in my breast ;</l>
     <l n="26">I wanted nothing fortune could supply ,</l>
     <l n="27">Nor did she slumber till that hour deny .</l>
     <l n="28">I wonder 'd then , but after found it true ,</l>
     <l n="29">Much joy had dried away the balmy dew :</l>
     <l n="30">Seas would be pools , without the brushing air 30</l>
     <l n="31">To curl the waves ; and sure some little care</l>
     <l n="32">Should weary nature so , to make her want repair .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="33">When Chanticleer the second watch had sung ,</l>
     <l n="34">Scorning the scorner sleep , from bed I sprung ;</l>
     <l n="35">And dressing , by the moon , in loose array ,</l>
     <l n="36">Pass 'd out in open air , preventing day ,</l>
     <l n="37">And sought a goodly grove , as fancy led my way .</l>
     <l n="38">Straight as a line in beauteous order stood</l>
     <l n="39">Of oaks unshorn a venerable wood ;</l>
     <l n="40">Fresh was the grass beneath , and every tree , 40</l>
     <l n="41">At distance planted in a due degree ,</l>
     <l n="42">Their branching arms in air with equal space</l>
     <l n="43">Stretch 'd to their neighbours with a long embrace :</l>
     <l n="44">And the new leaves on every bough were seen ,</l>
     <l n="45">Some ruddy colour 'd , some of lighter green .</l>
     <l n="46">The painted birds , companions of the spring ,</l>
     <l n="47">Hopping from spray to spray , were heard to sing .</l>
     <l n="48">Both eyes and ears received a like delight ,</l>
     <l n="49">Enchanting music , and a charming sight .</l>
     <l n="50">On Philomel I fix 'd my whole desire , 50</l>
     <l n="51">And listen 'd for the queen of all the quire ;</l>
     <l n="52">Fain would I hear her heavenly voice to sing ;</l>
     <l n="53">And wanted yet an omen to the spring .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="54">Attending long in vain , I took the way</l>
     <l n="55">Which through a path but scarcely printed lay ;</l>
     <l n="56">In narrow mazes oft it seem 'd to meet ,</l>
     <l n="57">And look 'd as lightly press 'd by fairy feet .</l>
     <l n="58">Wandering I walk 'd alone , for still methought</l>
     <l n="59">To some strange end so strange a path was wrought :</l>
     <l n="60">At last it led me where an arbour stood , 60</l>
     <l n="61">The sacred receptacle of the wood :</l>
     <l n="62">This place unmark 'd , though oft I walk 'd the green ,</l>
     <l n="63">In all my progress I had never seen :</l>
     <l n="64">And seized at once with wonder and delight ,</l>
     <l n="65">Gazed all around me , new to the transporting sight .</l>
     <l n="66">‘ Twas bench 'd with turf , and goodly to be seen ,</l>
     <l n="67">The thick young grass arose in fresher green :</l>
     <l n="68">The mound was newly made , no sight could pass</l>
     <l n="69">Betwixt the nice partitions of the grass ,</l>
     <l n="70">The well-united sods so closely lay ; 70</l>
     <l n="71">And all around the shades defended it from day ;</l>
     <l n="72">For sycamores with eglantine were spread ,</l>
     <l n="73">A hedge about the sides , a covering overhead .</l>
     <l n="74">And so the fragrant brier was wove between ,</l>
     <l n="75">The sycamore and flowers were mixed with green ,</l>
     <l n="76">That nature seem 'd to vary the delight ,</l>
     <l n="77">And satisfied at once the smell and sight .</l>
     <l n="78">The master workman of the bower was known</l>
     <l n="79">Through fairy-lands , and built for Oberon ;</l>
     <l n="80">Who twining leaves with such proportion drew , 80</l>
     <l n="81">They rose by measure , and by rule they grew ;</l>
     <l n="82">No mortal tongue can half the beauty tell ;</l>
     <l n="83">For none but hands divine could work so well .</l>
     <l n="84">Both roof and sides were like a parlour made ,</l>
     <l n="85">A soft recess , and a cool summer shade ;</l>
     <l n="86">The hedge was set so thick , no foreign eye</l>
     <l n="87">The persons placed within it could espy ;</l>
     <l n="88">But all that pass 'd without with ease was seen ,</l>
     <l n="89">As if nor fence nor tree was placed between .</l>
     <l n="90">‘ Twas border 'd with a field ; and some was plain 90</l>
     <l n="91">With grass , and some was sow 'd with rising grain .</l>
     <l n="92">That ( now the dew with spangles deck 'd the ground )</l>
     <l n="93">A sweeter spot of earth was never found .</l>
     <l n="94">I look 'd , and look 'd , and still with new delight ;</l>
     <l n="95">Such joy my soul , such pleasures fill 'd my sight ;</l>
     <l n="96">And the fresh eglantine exhaled a breath ,</l>
     <l n="97">Whose odours were of power to raise from death .</l>
     <l n="98">Nor sullen discontent , nor anxious care ,</l>
     <l n="99">Even though brought thither , could inhabit there :</l>
     <l n="100">But thence they fled as from their mortal foe ; 100</l>
     <l n="101">For this sweet place could only pleasure know .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="102">Thus as I mused , I cast aside my eye ,</l>
     <l n="103">And saw a medlar-tree was planted nigh .</l>
     <l n="104">The spreading branches made a goodly show ,</l>
     <l n="105">And full of opening blooms was every bough :</l>
     <l n="106">A goldfinch there I saw , with gaudy pride</l>
     <l n="107">Of painted plumes , that hopp 'd from side to side ,</l>
     <l n="108">Still pecking as she pass 'd ; and still she drew</l>
     <l n="109">The sweets from every flower , and suck 'd the dew :</l>
     <l n="110">Sufficed at length , she warbled in her throat , 110</l>
     <l n="111">And tuned her voice to many a merry note ,</l>
     <l n="112">But indistinct , and neither sweet nor clear ,</l>
     <l n="113">Yet such as soothed my soul , and pleased my ear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="114">Her short performance was no sooner tried ,</l>
     <l n="115">When she I sought , the nightingale , replied :</l>
     <l n="116">So sweet , so shrill , so variously she sung ,</l>
     <l n="117">That the grove echoed , and the valleys rung ;</l>
     <l n="118">And I so ravish 'd with her heavenly note ,</l>
     <l n="119">I stood entranced , and had no room for thought ,</l>
     <l n="120">But all o'erhYpppHeNpower ' d with ecstasy of bliss , 120</l>
     <l n="121">Was in a pleasing dream of paradise .</l>
     <l n="122">At length I waked , and looking round the bower ,</l>
     <l n="123">Search 'd every tree , and pry 'd on every flower ,</l>
     <l n="124">If any where by chance I might espy</l>
     <l n="125">The rural poet of the melody ;</l>
     <l n="126">For still methought she sung not far away :</l>
     <l n="127">At last I found her on a laurel spray .</l>
     <l n="128">Close by my side she sat , and fair in sight ,</l>
     <l n="129">Full in a line , against her opposite ;</l>
     <l n="130">Where stood with eglantine the laurel twined ; 130</l>
     <l n="131">And both their native sweets were well conjoin 'd .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="132">On the green bank I sat , and listen 'd long ;</l>
     <l n="133">( Sitting was more convenient for the song ):</l>
     <l n="134">Nor till her lay was ended could I move ,</l>
     <l n="135">But wish 'd to dwell for ever in the grove .</l>
     <l n="136">Only methought the time too swiftly pass 'd ,</l>
     <l n="137">And every note I fear 'd would be the last .</l>
     <l n="138">My sight and smell , and hearing were employ 'd ,</l>
     <l n="139">And all three senses in full gust enjoy 'd .</l>
     <l n="140">And what alone did all the rest surpass , 140</l>
     <l n="141">The sweet possession of the fairy place ;</l>
     <l n="142">Single , and conscious to myself alone</l>
     <l n="143">Of pleasures to the excluded world unknown :</l>
     <l n="144">Pleasures which nowhere else were to be found ,</l>
     <l n="145">And all Elysium in a spot of ground .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="146">Thus while I sat intent to see and hear ,</l>
     <l n="147">And drew perfumes of more than vital air ,</l>
     <l n="148">All suddenly I heard the approaching sound</l>
     <l n="149">Of vocal music on the enchanted ground :</l>
     <l n="150">A host of saints it seem 'd , so full the quire ; 150</l>
     <l n="151">As if the bless 'd above did all conspire</l>
     <l n="152">To join their voices , and neglect the lyre .</l>
     <l n="153">At length there issued from the grove behind</l>
     <l n="154">A fair assembly of the female kind :</l>
     <l n="155">A train less fair , as ancient fathers tell ,</l>
     <l n="156">Seduced the sons of heaven to rebel .</l>
     <l n="157">I pass their form , and every charming grace ,</l>
     <l n="158">Less than an angel would their worth debase :</l>
     <l n="159">But their attire , like liveries of a kind ,</l>
     <l n="160">All rich and rare , is fresh within my mind . 160</l>
     <l n="161">In velvet white as snow the troop was gown 'd ,</l>
     <l n="162">The seams with sparkling emeralds set around ;</l>
     <l n="163">Their hoods and sleeves the same ; and purfled o'er</l>
     <l n="164">With diamonds , pearls , and all the shining store</l>
     <l n="165">Of eastern pomp : their long descending train ,</l>
     <l n="166">With rubies edged , and sapphires , swept the plain :</l>
     <l n="167">High on their heads , with jewels richly set ,</l>
     <l n="168">Each lady wore a radiant coronet .</l>
     <l n="169">Beneath the circles , all the quire was graced</l>
     <l n="170">With chaplets green on their fair foreheads placed : 170</l>
     <l n="171">Of laurel some , of woodbine many more ;</l>
     <l n="172">And wreaths of Agnus castus<span corresp="#note75" type="note_anchor">[ 75 ]</span>others bore ;</l>
     <l n="173">These last , who with those virgin crowns were dress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="174">Appear 'd in higher honour than the rest .</l>
     <l n="175">They danced around : but in the midst was seen</l>
     <l n="176">A lady of a more majestic mien ;</l>
     <l n="177">By stature , and by beauty mark 'd their sovereign queen</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="178">She in the midst began with sober grace ;</l>
     <l n="179">Her servants ’ eyes were fix 'd upon her face ;</l>
     <l n="180">And as she moved or turn 'd , her motions view 'd , 180</l>
     <l n="181">Her measures kept , and step by step pursued .</l>
     <l n="182">Methought she trod the ground with greater grace ,</l>
     <l n="183">With more of godhead shining in her face ;</l>
     <l n="184">And as in beauty she surpass 'd the quire ,</l>
     <l n="185">So , nobler than the rest , was her attire .</l>
     <l n="186">A crown of ruddy gold enclosed her brow ,</l>
     <l n="187">Plain without pomp , and rich without a show :</l>
     <l n="188">A branch of Agnus castus in her hand</l>
     <l n="189">She bore aloft ( her sceptre of command ) ;</l>
     <l n="190">Admired , adored by all the circling crowd , 190</l>
     <l n="191">For wheresoe'er she turn 'd her face , they bow 'd :</l>
     <l n="192">And as she danced , a roundelay she sung ,</l>
     <l n="193">In honour of the laurel , ever young :</l>
     <l n="194">She raised her voice on high , and sung so clear ,</l>
     <l n="195">The fawns came scudding from the groves to hear :</l>
     <l n="196">And all the bending forest lent an ear .</l>
     <l n="197">At every close she made , the attending throng</l>
     <l n="198">Replied , and bore the burden of the song :</l>
     <l n="199">So just , so small , yet in so sweet a note ,</l>
     <l n="200">It seem 'd the music melted in the throat . 200</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="201">Thus dancing on , and singing as they danced ,</l>

     <l n="205">O'erjoy ' d to see the jolly troops so near ,</l>
     <l n="206">But somewhat awed , I shook with holy fear ;</l>

     <l n="4">Gamboll 'd on heaths , and danced on every green ;</l>

     <l n="13">Above the rest our Britain held they dear ,</l>
     <l n="14">More solemnly they kept their sabbaths here ,</l>
     <l n="15">And made more spacious rings , and revell 'd half the year .</l>

     <l n="16">I speak of ancient times , for now the swain</l>
     <l n="17">Returning late may pass the woods in vain ,</l>

     <l n="19">In vain the dairy now with mints is dress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="20">The dairymaid expects no fairy guest , 20</l>
     <l n="21">To skim the bowls , and after pay the feast .</l>
     <l n="22">She sighs and shakes her empty shoes in vain ,</l>
     <l n="23">No silver penny to reward her pain :</l>
     <l n="24">For priests , with prayers , and other godly gear ,</l>
     <l n="25">Have made the merry goblins disappear ;</l>
     <l n="26">And where they play 'd their merry pranks before ,</l>
     <l n="27">Have sprinkled holy water on the floor :</l>
     <l n="28">And friars , that through the wealthy regions run ,</l>
     <l n="29">Thick as the motes that twinkle in the sun ,</l>
     <l n="30">Resort to farmers rich , and bless their halls , 30</l>
     <l n="31">And exorcise the beds , and cross the walls :</l>

     <l n="42">The maids and women need no danger fear</l>
     <l n="43">To walk by night , and sanctity so near :</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="46">It so befell , in this King Arthur 's reign ,</l>
     <l n="47">A lusty knight was pricking o'er the plain ;</l>
     <l n="48">A bachelor he was , and of the courtly train .</l>
     <l n="49">It happen 'd , as he rode , a damsel gay ,</l>
     <l n="50">In russet robes , to market took her way . 50</l>
     <l n="51">Soon on the girl he cast an amorous eye ,</l>
     <l n="52">So straight she walk 'd , and on her pasterns high :</l>
     <l n="53">If , seeing her behind , he liked her pace ,</l>
     <l n="54">Now turning short , he better likes her face .</l>
     <l n="55">He lights in haste , and , full of youthful fire ,</l>
     <l n="56">By force accomplish 'd his obscene desire :</l>
     <l n="57">This done , away he rode , not unespied ,</l>
     <l n="58">For swarming at his back the country cried :</l>
     <l n="59">And once in view they never lost the sight ,</l>
     <l n="60">But seized , and pinion 'd brought to court the knight , 60</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="61">Then courts of kings were held in high renown ,</l>
     <l n="62">Ere made the common brothels of the town :</l>
     <l n="63">There , virgins honourable vows received ,</l>
     <l n="64">But chaste as maids in monasteries lived :</l>
     <l n="65">The king himself , to nuptial ties a slave ,</l>
     <l n="66">No bad example to his poets gave :</l>
     <l n="67">And they , not bad , but in a vicious age ,</l>
     <l n="68">Had not , to please the prince , debauch 'd the stage .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="69">Now , what should Arthur do ? He loved the knight ,</l>
     <l n="70">But sovereign monarchs are the source of right : 70</l>
     <l n="71">Moved by the damsel 's tears and common cry ,</l>
     <l n="72">He doom 'd the brutal ravisher to die .</l>
     <l n="73">But fair Geneura rose in his defence ,</l>
     <l n="74">And pray 'd so hard for mercy from the prince ,</l>
     <l n="75">That to his queen the king the offender gave ,</l>
     <l n="76">And left it in her power to kill or save :</l>
     <l n="77">This gracious act the ladies all approve ,</l>
     <l n="78">Who thought it much a man should die for love ;</l>
     <l n="79">And with their mistress join 'd in close debate ,</l>
     <l n="80">( Covering their kindness with dissembled hate ) 80</l>
     <l n="81">If not to free him , to prolong his fate .</l>
     <l n="82">At last agreed , they call him by consent</l>

     <l n="86">Sir knight , though I have ask 'd thy life , yet still</l>

     <l n="88">Nor hast thou other surety than the grace</l>
     <l n="89">Not due to thee from our offended race .</l>

     <l n="91">And cannot blood without a sigh behold ,</l>

     <l n="95">Shall set thee free from our avenging hand .</l>
     <l n="96">The question , whose solution I require ,</l>
     <l n="97">Is , What the sex of women most desire ?</l>
     <l n="98">In this dispute thy judges are at strife ;</l>

     <l n="100">Yet ( lest surprised , unknowing what to say , 100</l>
     <l n="101">Thou damn thyself ) we give thee farther day :</l>

     <l n="110">The terms accepted , as the fair ordain , 110</l>
     <l n="111">He put in bail for his return again ,</l>

     <l n="114">His leave thus taken , on his way he went</l>

     <l n="117">‘ Twas hard the truth of such a point to find ,</l>
     <l n="118">As was not yet agreed among the kind .</l>
     <l n="119">Thus on he went ; still anxious more and more ,</l>
     <l n="120">Ask 'd all he met , and knock 'd at every door ; 120</l>
     <l n="121">Inquired of men ; but made his chief request ,</l>
     <l n="122">To learn from women what they loved the best .</l>
     <l n="123">They answer 'd each according to her mind ,</l>
     <l n="124">To please herself , not all the female kind .</l>
     <l n="125">One was for wealth , another was for place ;</l>
     <l n="126">Crones , old and ugly , wish 'd a better face :</l>
     <l n="127">The widow 's wish was oftentimes to wed ;</l>
     <l n="128">The wanton maids were all for sport a-bed .</l>
     <l n="129">Some said the sex were pleased with handsome lies ,</l>
     <l n="130">And some gross flattery loved without disguise : 130</l>
     <l n="131">Truth is , says one , he seldom fails to win</l>
     <l n="132">Who flatters well ; for that 's our darling sin :</l>

     <l n="134">Will work even with the wisest of the kind .</l>
     <l n="135">One thought the sex 's prime felicity</l>
     <l n="136">Was from the bonds of wedlock to be free ;</l>
     <l n="137">Their pleasures , hours , and actions all their own ,</l>
     <l n="138">And uncontroll 'd to give account to none .</l>
     <l n="139">Some wish a husband-fool ; but such are cursed ,</l>
     <l n="140">For fools perverse of husbands are the worst : 140</l>
     <l n="141">All women would be counted chaste and wise ,</l>
     <l n="142">Nor should our spouses see , but with our eyes ;</l>
     <l n="143">For fools will prate ; and though they want the wit</l>
     <l n="144">To find close faults , yet open blots will hit ;</l>
     <l n="145">Though better for their ease to hold their tongue ,</l>
     <l n="146">For womankind was never in the wrong .</l>
     <l n="147">So noise ensues , and quarrels last for life ;</l>
     <l n="148">The wife abhors the fool , the fool the wife .</l>
     <l n="149">And some men say that great delight have we ,</l>

     <l n="151">And constant in one purpose still to dwell ;</l>
     <l n="152">And not our husbands ’ counsels to reveal .</l>
     <l n="153">But that 's a fable ; for our sex is frail ,</l>

     <l n="184">Of honour tied her tongue from self-defence .</l>
     <l n="185">A marshy ground commodiously was near ,</l>
     <l n="186">Thither she ran , and held her breath for fear ;</l>

     <l n="188">That word might be the secret of the king .</l>
     <l n="189">Thus full of counsel to the fen she went ,</l>

     <l n="386">The King of Heaven was in a manger laid ,</l>

     <l n="389">Since floods no higher than their fountains flow .</l>
     <l n="390">We , who for name and empty honour strive , 390</l>
     <l n="391">Our true nobility from him derive .</l>

     <l n="393">And vast estates to mighty titles tied ,</l>
     <l n="394">Did not your honour , but their own , advance ;</l>
     <l n="395">For virtue comes not by inheritance .</l>
     <l n="396">If you tralineate from your father 's mind ,</l>
     <l n="397">What are you else but of a bastard kind ?</l>
     <l n="398">Do , as your great progenitors have done ,</l>
     <l n="399">And , by their virtues , prove yourself their son .</l>
     <l n="400">No father can infuse or wit or grace ; 400</l>
     <l n="401">A mother comes across , and mars the race .</l>
     <l n="402">A grandsire or a grandame taints the blood ;</l>
     <l n="403">And seldom three descents continue good .</l>
     <l n="404">Were virtue by descent , a noble name</l>
     <l n="405">Could never villanise his father 's fame ;</l>
     <l n="406">But , as the first , the last of all the line ,</l>
     <l n="407">Would , like the sun , even in descending shine ;</l>
     <l n="408">Take fire , and bear it to the darkest house ,</l>
     <l n="409">Betwixt King Arthur 's court and Caucasus :</l>
     <l n="410">If you depart , the flame shall still remain , 410</l>
     <l n="411">And the bright blaze enlighten all the plain :</l>
     <l n="412">Nor , till the fuel perish , can decay ,</l>
     <l n="413">By nature form 'd on things combustible to prey .</l>
     <l n="414">Such is not man , who , mixing better seed</l>
     <l n="415">With worse , begets a base degenerate breed :</l>
     <l n="416">The bad corrupts the good , and leaves behind</l>
     <l n="417">No trace of all the great begetter 's mind .</l>
     <l n="418">The father sinks within his son , we see ,</l>
     <l n="419">And often rises in the third degree ;</l>
     <l n="420">If better luck a better mother give , 420</l>
     <l n="421">Chance gave us being , and by chance we live .</l>
     <l n="422">Such as our atoms were , even such are we ,</l>
     <l n="423">Or call it chance , or strong necessity :</l>
     <l n="424">Thus loaded with dead weight , the will is free .</l>
     <l n="425">And thus it needs must be ; for seed conjoin 'd</l>
     <l n="426">Lets into nature 's work the imperfect kind ;</l>
     <l n="427">But fire , the enlivener of the general frame ,</l>
     <l n="428">Is one , its operation still the same .</l>
     <l n="429">Its principle is in itself : while ours</l>
     <l n="430">Works , as confederates war , with mingled powers ; 430</l>
     <l n="431">Or man or woman , which soever fails :</l>
     <l n="432">And oft the vigour of the worse prevails .</l>
     <l n="433">Aether with sulphur blended alters hue ,</l>
     <l n="434">And casts a dusky gleam of Sodom blue .</l>
     <l n="435">Thus , in a brute , their ancient honour ends ,</l>
     <l n="436">And the fair mermaid in a fish descends :</l>
     <l n="437">The line is gone ; no longer duke or earl ;</l>
     <l n="438">But , by himself degraded , turns a churl .</l>
     <l n="439">Nobility of blood is but renown</l>
     <l n="440">Of thy great fathers by their virtue known , 440</l>
     <l n="441">And a long trail of light , to thee descending down .</l>
     <l n="442">If in thy smoke it ends , their glories shine ;</l>
     <l n="443">But infamy and villanage are thine .</l>
     <l n="444">Then what I said before is plainly show 'd ,</l>
     <l n="445">The true nobility proceeds from God ;</l>
     <l n="446">Nor left us by inheritance , but given</l>
     <l n="447">By bounty of our stars , and grace of Heaven .</l>
     <l n="448">Thus from a captive Servius Tullius rose ,</l>
     <l n="449">Whom for his virtues the first Romans chose :</l>
     <l n="450">Fabricius from their walls repell 'd the foe , 450</l>
     <l n="451">Whose noble hands had exercised the plough .</l>
     <l n="452">From hence , my lord , and love , I thus conclude ,</l>
     <l n="453">That though my homely ancestors were rude ,</l>
     <l n="454">Mean as I am , yet I may have the grace</l>
     <l n="455">To make you father of a generous race :</l>
     <l n="456">And noble then am I , when I begin ,</l>
     <l n="457">In virtue clothed , to cast the rags of sin .</l>
     <l n="458">If poverty be my upbraided crime ,</l>
     <l n="459">And you believe in Heaven , there was a time</l>
     <l n="460">When He , the great controller of our fate , 460</l>
     <l n="461">Deign 'd to be man , and lived in low estate ;</l>
     <l n="462">Which He who had the world at his dispose ,</l>
     <l n="463">If poverty were vice , would never choose .</l>
     <l n="464">Philosophers have said , and poets sing ,</l>
     <l n="465">That a glad poverty 's an honest thing .</l>
     <l n="466">Content is wealth , the riches of the mind ;</l>
     <l n="467">And happy he who can that treasure find .</l>
     <l n="468">But the base miser starves amidst his store ,</l>
     <l n="469">Broods on his gold , and , griping still at more ,</l>
     <l n="470">Sits sadly pining , and believes he 's poor . 470</l>
     <l n="471">The ragged beggar , though he want relief ,</l>
     <l n="472">Has not to lose , and sings before the thief .</l>
     <l n="473">Want is a bitter and a hateful good ,</l>
     <l n="474">Because its virtues are not understood ;</l>
     <l n="475">Yet many things , impossible to thought ,</l>
     <l n="476">Have been by need to full perfection brought :</l>
     <l n="477">The daring of the soul proceeds from thence ,</l>
     <l n="478">Sharpness of wit , and active diligence :</l>
     <l n="479">Prudence at once , and fortitude , it gives ,</l>
     <l n="480">And , if in patience taken , mends our lives ; 480</l>
     <l n="481">For even that indigence , that brings me low ,</l>
     <l n="482">Makes me myself , and Him above , to know .</l>
     <l n="483">A good which none would challenge , few would choose ,</l>
     <l n="484">A fair possession , which mankind refuse .</l>
     <l n="485">If we from wealth to poverty descend ,</l>
     <l n="486">Want gives to know the flatterer from the friend .</l>
     <l n="487">If I am old and ugly , well for you ,</l>
     <l n="488">No lewd adulterer will my love pursue ;</l>
     <l n="489">Nor jealousy , the bane of married life ,</l>
     <l n="490">Shall haunt you for a wither 'd homely wife ; 490</l>
     <l n="491">For age and ugliness , as all agree ,</l>
     <l n="492">Are the best guards of female chastity .</l>
     <l n="493">Yet since I see your mind is worldly bent ,</l>
     <l n="494">I 'll do my best to further your content .</l>
     <l n="495">And therefore of two gifts in my dispose ,</l>
     <l n="496">Think ere you speak , I grant you leave to choose :</l>
     <l n="497">Would you I should be still deform 'd and old ,</l>
     <l n="498">Nauseous to touch , and loathsome to behold ;</l>
     <l n="499">On this condition to remain for life ,</l>
     <l n="500">A careful , tender , and obedient wife , 500</l>
     <l n="501">In all I can contribute to your ease ,</l>
     <l n="502">And not in deed , or word , or thought displease :</l>
     <l n="503">Or would you rather have me young and fair ,</l>
     <l n="504">And take the chance that happens to your share ?</l>
     <l n="505">Temptations are in beauty , and in youth ,</l>
     <l n="506">And how can you depend upon my truth ?</l>
     <l n="507">Now weigh the danger with the doubtful bliss ,</l>
     <l n="508">And thank yourself , if aught should fall amiss .</l>

    <p>THE CHARACTER OF A GOOD PARSON .<span corresp="#note80" type="note_anchor">[ 80 ]</span></p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A parish priest was of the pilgrim train ;</l>
     <l n="2">An awful , reverend , and religious man .</l>
     <l n="3">His eyes diffused a venerable grace ,</l>
     <l n="4">And charity itself was in his face .</l>
     <l n="5">Rich was his soul , though his attire was poor ;</l>
     <l n="6">( As God had clothed his own ambassador ;)</l>
     <l n="7">For such , on earth , his bless 'd Redeemer bore .</l>
     <l n="8">Of sixty years he seem 'd ; and well might last</l>
     <l n="9">To sixty more , but that he lived too fast ;</l>
     <l n="10">Refined himself to soul , to curb the sense ; 10</l>
     <l n="11">And made almost a sin of abstinence ,</l>
     <l n="12">Yet , had his aspect nothing of severe ,</l>
     <l n="13">But such a face as promised him sincere .</l>
     <l n="14">Nothing reserved or sullen was to see ;</l>
     <l n="15">But sweet regards , and pleasing sanctity :</l>
     <l n="16">Mild was his accent , and his action free .</l>
     <l n="17">With eloquence innate his tongue was arm 'd ;</l>
     <l n="18">Though harsh the precept , yet the preacher charm 'd .</l>
     <l n="19">For letting down the golden chain from high ,</l>
     <l n="20">He drew his audience upward to the sky ; 20</l>
     <l n="21">And oft , with holy hymns , he charm 'd their ears :</l>
     <l n="22">( A music more melodious than the spheres . )</l>
     <l n="23">For David left him , when he went to rest ,</l>
     <l n="24">His lyre ; and after him he sung the best .</l>
     <l n="25">He bore his great commission in his look :</l>
     <l n="26">But sweetly temper 'd awe ; and soften 'd all he spoke .</l>
     <l n="27">He preach 'd the joys of heaven , and pains of hell ;</l>
     <l n="28">And warn 'd the sinner with becoming zeal ;</l>
     <l n="29">But on eternal mercy loved to dwell .</l>
     <l n="30">He taught the gospel rather than the law , 30</l>
     <l n="31">And forced himself to drive : but loved to draw .</l>
     <l n="32">For fear but freezes minds ; but love , like heat ,</l>
     <l n="33">Exhales the soul sublime , to seek her native seat .</l>
     <l n="34">To threats the stubborn sinner oft is hard ,</l>
     <l n="35">Wrapp 'd in his crimes , against the storm prepared ;</l>
     <l n="36">But , when the milder beams of mercy play ,</l>
     <l n="37">He melts , and throws his cumbrous cloak away ,</l>
     <l n="38">Lightning and thunder ( heaven 's artillery )</l>
     <l n="39">As harbingers before the Almighty fly :</l>
     <l n="40">Those but proclaim his style , and disappear ; 40</l>
     <l n="41">The stiller sound succeeds , and God is there .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="42">The tithes , his parish freely paid , he took ;</l>
     <l n="43">But never sued , or cursed with bell and book .</l>
     <l n="44">With patience bearing wrong ; but offering none :</l>
     <l n="45">Since every man is free to lose his own .</l>
     <l n="46">The country churls , according to their kind ,</l>
     <l n="47">( Who grudge their dues , and love to be behind ) ,</l>
     <l n="48">The less he sought his offerings , pinch 'd the more ,</l>
     <l n="49">And praised a priest contented to be poor .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="50">Yet of his little he had some to spare , 50</l>
     <l n="51">To feed the famish 'd , and to clothe the bare ;</l>
     <l n="52">For mortified he was to that degree ,</l>
     <l n="53">A poorer than himself he would not see .</l>
     <l n="54">True priests , he said , and preachers of the Word ,</l>
     <l n="55">Were only stewards of their sovereign Lord :</l>
     <l n="56">Nothing was theirs ; but all the public store ;</l>
     <l n="57">Intrusted riches , to relieve the poor :</l>
     <l n="58">Who , should they steal for want of his relief ,</l>
     <l n="59">He judged himself accomplice with the thief .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="60">Wide was his parish ; not contracted close 60</l>
     <l n="61">In streets , but here and there a straggling house ;</l>
     <l n="62">Yet still he was at hand , without request ,</l>
     <l n="63">To serve the sick ; to succour the distress 'd :</l>
     <l n="64">Tempting , on foot , alone , without affright ,</l>
     <l n="65">The dangers of a dark tempestuous night .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="66">All this the good old man perform 'd alone ,</l>
     <l n="67">Nor spared his pains ; for curate he had none :</l>
     <l n="68">Nor durst he trust another with his care ;</l>
     <l n="69">Nor rode himself to Paul 's , the public fair ,</l>
     <l n="70">To chaffer for preferment with his gold , 70</l>
     <l n="71">Where bishoprics and sinecures are sold :</l>
     <l n="72">But duly watch 'd his flock , by night and day ,</l>
     <l n="73">And from the prowling wolf redeem 'd the prey ;</l>
     <l n="74">And hungry sent the wily fox away .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="75">The proud he tamed , the penitent he cheer 'd ;</l>
     <l n="76">Nor to rebuke the rich offender fear 'd .</l>
     <l n="77">His preaching much , but more his practice wrought ;</l>
     <l n="78">( A living sermon of the truths he taught ) ;</l>
     <l n="79">For this by rules severe his life he squared ,</l>
     <l n="80">That all might see the doctrine which they heard . 80</l>
     <l n="81">For priests , he said , are patterns for the rest :</l>
     <l n="82">( The gold of heaven , who bear the God impress 'd ):</l>
     <l n="83">But when the precious coin is kept unclean ,</l>
     <l n="84">The Sovereign 's image is no longer seen .</l>
     <l n="85">If they be foul on whom the people trust ,</l>
     <l n="86">Well may the baser brass contract a rust .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="87">The prelate for his holy life he prized ;</l>
     <l n="88">The worldly pomp of prelacy despised :</l>
     <l n="89">His Saviour came not with a gaudy show ;</l>
     <l n="90">Nor was his kingdom of the world below . 90</l>
     <l n="91">Patience in want , and poverty of mind ,</l>
     <l n="92">These marks of Church and Churchmen he design 'd ,</l>
     <l n="93">And living taught , and dying left behind .</l>
     <l n="94">The crown he wore was of the pointed thorn :</l>
     <l n="95">In purple he was crucified , not born .</l>
     <l n="96">They who contend for place and high degree ,</l>
     <l n="97">Are not his sons , but those of Zebedee .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="98">Not but he knew the signs of earthly power</l>
     <l n="99">Might well become Saint Peter 's successor ;</l>
     <l n="100">The holy father holds a double reign , 100</l>
     <l n="101">The prince may keep his pomp , the fisher must be plain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="102">Such was the saint , who shone with every grace ,</l>
     <l n="103">Reflecting , Moses ’ - like , his Maker 's face .</l>
     <l n="104">God saw his image lively was express 'd ;</l>
     <l n="105">And his own work , as in creation , bless 'd .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="106">The Tempter saw him too , with envious eye ;</l>
     <l n="107">And , as on Job , demanded leave to try .</l>
     <l n="108">He took the time when Richard was deposed ,</l>
     <l n="109">And high and low with happy Harry closed .</l>
     <l n="110">This prince , though great in arms , the priest withstood : 110</l>
     <l n="111">Near though he was , yet not the next of blood .</l>
     <l n="112">Had Richard , unconstrain 'd , resign 'd the throne ,</l>
     <l n="113">A king can give no more than is his own :</l>
     <l n="114">The title stood entail 'd , had Richard had a son .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="115">Conquest , an odious name , was laid aside ,</l>
     <l n="116">Where all submitted , none the battle tried .</l>
     <l n="117">The senseless plea of right by Providence</l>
     <l n="118">Was , by a flattering priest , invented since ;</l>
     <l n="119">And lasts no longer than the present sway ;</l>
     <l n="120">But justifies the next who comes in play . 120</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="121">The people 's right remains ; let those who dare</l>
     <l n="122">Dispute their power , when they the judges are .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="123">He join 'd not in their choice , because he knew</l>
     <l n="124">Worse might , and often did , from change ensue .</l>
     <l n="125">Much to himself he thought ; but little spoke ;</l>
     <l n="126">And , undeprived , his benefice forsook .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="127">Now , through the land , his cure of souls he stretch 'd ;</l>
     <l n="128">And like a primitive apostle preach 'd :</l>
     <l n="129">Still cheerful ; ever constant to his call ;</l>
     <l n="130">By many follow 'd ; loved by most , admired by all . 130</l>
     <l n="131">With what he begg 'd , his brethren he relieved :</l>
     <l n="132">And gave the charities himself received .</l>
     <l n="133">Gave , while he taught ; and edified the more ,</l>
     <l n="134">Because he showed , by proof , ‘ twas easy to be poor .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="135">He went not with the crowd to see a shrine ;</l>
     <l n="136">But fed us , by the way , with food divine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="137">In deference to his virtues , I forbear</l>
     <l n="138">To show you what the rest in orders were :</l>
     <l n="139">This brilliant is so spotless and so bright ,</l>
     <l n="140">He needs no foil , but shines by his own proper light . 140</l>
