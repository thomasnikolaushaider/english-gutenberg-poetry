   <p>RELIGIO LAICI .</p>
   <p>The Religio Laici , according to Johnson , is almost the only work of Dryden which can be considered as a voluntary effusion . I do not see much ground for this assertion . Dryden was indeed obliged to write by the necessity of his circumstances ; but the choice of the mode in which he was to labour was his own , as well in his Fables and other poems , as in that which follows . Nay , upon examination , the Religio Laici appears , in a great measure , a controversial , and almost a political poem ; and , being such , cannot be termed , with propriety , a voluntary effusion , any more than “ The Medal , ” or “ Absalom and Achitophel . ” It is evident , Dryden had his own times in consideration , and the effect which the poem was likely to produce upon them . Religious controversy had mingled deeply with the party politics of the reign of Charles II . Divided , as the nation was , into the three great sects of Churchmen , Papists , and Dissenters , their several creeds were examined by their antagonists with scrupulous malignity , and every hint extracted from them which could be turned to the disadvantage of those who professed them . To the Catholics , the dissenters objected their cruel intolerance and jesuitical practices ; to the church of England , their servile dependence on the crown , and slavish doctrine of non-resistance . The Catholics , on the other hand , charged the reformed church of England with desertion from the original doctrines of Christianity , with denying the infallibility of general councils , and destroying the unity of the church ; and against the fanatics , they objected their anti-monarchical tenets , the wild visions of their independent preachers , and their seditious cabals against the church and state . While the church of England was thus assailed by two foes , who did not at the same time spare each other , it probably occurred to Dryden , that he , who could explain her tenets by a plain and philosophical commentary , had a chance , not only of contributing to fix and regulate the faith of her professors , but of reconciling to her , as the middle course , the Catholics and the fanatics . The Duke of York and the Papists , on the one hand , were urging the king to the most desperate measures ; on the other , the popular faction were just not in arms . The king , with the assistance and advice of Halifax , was trimming his course betwixt these outrageous and furious torrents . Whatever , therefore , at this important crisis , might act as a sedative on the inflamed spirits of all parties , and encourage them to abide with patience the events of futurity , was a main point in favour of the crown . A rational and philosophical view of the tenets of the national church , liberally expressed , and decorated with the ornaments of poetry , seemed calculated to produce this effect ; and as I have no doubt , as well from the preface , as from passages in the poem , that Dryden had such a purpose in view , I have ventured to place the Religio Laici among his historical and political poems .<span corresp="#note1" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></p>
   <p>I would not , from what is above stated , be understood to mean , that Dryden wrote this poem merely with a view to politics , and that he was himself sceptical in the matters of which it treats .— On the contrary , I have no doubt , that it expresses , without disguise or reservation , what was then the author 's serious and firm , though , as it unfortunately proved , not his unalterable religious opinion . The remarkable line in the “ Hind and Panther , ” seems to refer to the state of his mind at this period ; and this system of divinity was among the “ new sparkles which his pride had struck forth , ” after he had abandoned the fanatical doctrines in which he was doubtless educated .<span corresp="#note2" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>It is therefore probable , that , having formed for himself , on grounds which seemed to warrant it , a rational exposition of the national creed , he was willing to communicate it to the public at a period , when moderation of religious zeal was so essentially necessary to the repose of the nation .</p>
   <p>Considered in this point of view , the Religio Laici is one of the most admirable poems in the language . The argumentative part is conducted with singular skill , upon those topics which occasioned the principal animosity between the religious sects ; and the deductions are drawn in favour of the church of England with so much apparent impartiality , that those who could not assent , had at least no title to be angry . The opinions of the various classes of free-thinkers are combated by an appeal to those feelings of the human mind , which always acknowledge an offended Deity , and to the various modes in which all ages and nations have shewn their sense of the necessity of an atonement by sacrifice and penance . Dryden , however , differs from most philosophers , who suppose this consciousness of guilt to be originally implanted in our bosoms : he , somewhat fantastically , argues , as if it were some remnants of the original faith revealed to Noah , and preserved by the posterity of Shem . The inadequacy of sacrifices and oblations , when compared with the crimes of those by whom they are made , and with the grandeur of the omnipotent Being , to whom they are offered , paves the way for the imputed righteousness of Jesus Christ , the fundamental doctrine of the Christian religion . The fitness of this vicarious sacrifice to accomplish the redemption of man , and vindicate the justice and mercy of God ; the obvious impossibility that the writings , or authors , by which it has been conveyed to us , should be less than inspired ; the progress of the Christian faith itself , though militating against the corrupt dispositions of humanity , and graced with none of those attractions by which Mahomet , and other false prophets , bribed their followers , are then successively urged as evidences of the Christian religion . The poet then recurs to an objection , at which he had hinted in his preface . If the Christian religion is necessary to salvation , why is it not extended to all nations of the earth ? And suppose we grant that the circumstance of the revealed religion having been formerly preached and embraced in great part of the world where it is now unknown , shall be sufficient to subject those regions to be judged by its laws , what is to become of the generations who have lived before the coming of the Messiah ? what of the inhabitants of those countries on which the beams of the gospel have never shone ? To these doubts , I hope most Christians will think our author returns a liberal , and not a presumptuous answer , in supposing that the heathen will be judged according to the light which it has pleased God to afford them ; and that , infinitely less fortunate than us in the extent of their spiritual knowledge , they will only be called upon to answer for their conformity with the dictates of their own conscience . The authority of St Athanasius our author here sets aside , either because in the ardour of his dispute with Arius he carried his doctrine too far , or because his creed only has reference to the decision of a doctrinal question in the Christian church ; and the anathema annexed applies not to the heathen world , but to those , who , having heard the orthodox faith preached , have wilfully chosen the heresy . Dryden next takes under review the work of Father Simon ; and , after an eulogy on the author and translator , pronounces , that the former was not a bigotted Catholic , since he did not hesitate to challenge some of the traditions of the church of Rome . To these traditions , these “ brushwood helps , ” with which the Catholics endeavoured to fence the doctrines of their church , our author proceeds , and throws them aside as liable to error and corruption . The pretensions of the church of Rome , by her pope and general councils , infallibly to determine the authenticity of church tradition , is the next proposition . To this the poet answers , that if they possess infallibility at all , it ought to go the length of restoring the canon , or correcting the corrupt copies of scripture ; a reply which seems to concede to the Romans ; as , without denying the grounds of their claim , it only asserts , that it is not sufficiently extended . Upon , the ground , however , that the plea of infallibility , by which the poet is obviously somewhat embarrassed , must be dismissed , as proving too much , the holy scriptures are referred to as the sole rule of faith ; admitting such explanations as the church of England has given to the contested doctrines of Christianity . The unlettered Christian , we are told , does well to pursue , in simplicity , his path to heaven ; the learned divine is to study well the sacred scriptures , with such assistance as the most early traditions of the church , especially those which are written , may , in doubtful points , afford him . It is in this argument chiefly , that there may be traced a sort of vacillation and uncertainty in our author 's opinion , boding what afterwards took place — his acquiescence in the church authority of Rome . Nevertheless , having vaguely pronounced , that some traditions are to be received , and others rejected , he gives his opinion against the Roman see , which dictated to the laity the explications of doctrine as adopted by the church , and prohibited them to form their own opinion upon the text , or even to peruse the sacred volume which contains it . This Dryden contrasts with the opposite evil , of vulgar enthusiasts debasing scripture by their own absurd commentaries , and dividing into as many sects , as there are wayward opinions formed upon speculative doctrine . He concludes , that both extremes are to be avoided ; that saving faith does not depend on nice disquisitions ; yet , if inquisitive minds are hurried into such , the scripture , and the commentary of the fathers , are their only safe guides :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">And after hearing what our church can say ,</l>
     <l n="2">If still our reason runs another way ,</l>
     <l n="3">That private reason ‘ tis more just to curb ,</l>
     <l n="4">Than by disputes the public peace disturb ;</l>
     <l n="5">For points obscure are of small use to learn ,</l>
     <l n="6">But common quiet is mankind 's concern .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In considering Dryden 's creed thus analyzed , I think it will appear , that the author , though still holding the doctrines of the church of England , had been biassed , in the course of his enquiry , by those of Rome . His wish for the possibility of an infallible guide ,<span corresp="#note3" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>expressed with almost indecent ardour , the difficulty , nay , it would seem , in his estimation , almost the impossibility , of discriminating between corrupted and authentic traditions , while the necessity of the latter to the interpretation of scripture is plainly admitted , appear , upon the whole , to have left the poet 's mind in an unpleasing state of doubt , from which he rather escapes than is relieved . He who only acquiesces in the doctrines of his church , because the exercise of his private judgement may disturb the tranquillity of the state , can hardly be said to be in a state to give a reason for the faith that is in him .</p>
   <p>The doctrine of the Religio Laici is admirably adapted to the subject : though treating of the most abstruse doctrines of Christianity , it is as clear and perspicuous as the most humble prose , while it has all the elegance and effect which argument is capable of receiving from poetry . Johnson , usually sufficiently niggard of praise , has allowed , that this “ is a composition of great excellence in its kind , in which the familiar is very properly diversified with the solemn , and the grave with the humorous ; in which metre has neither weakened the force , nor clouded the perspicuity of argument ; nor will it be easy to find another example , equally happy , of this middle kind of writing , which , though prosaic in some parts , rises to high poetry in others , and neither towers to the skies , nor creeps along the ground . "[ 4 ] I cannot help remarking , that the style of the Religio Laici has been imitated successfully by the late Mr Cowper in some of his pieces . Yet he has not been always able to maintain the resemblance , but often crawls where Dryden would have walked . The natural dignity of our author may be discovered in the lamest lines of the poem , whereas his imitator is often harsh and embarrassed . Both are occasionally prosaic ; but in such passages Dryden 's verse resembles good prose , and Cowper 's that which is feeble and involved .</p>
   <p>The name which Dryden has thought proper to affix to this declaration of his faith , seems to have been rather fashionable about that time . There is a treatise de Religione Laici , attached to the work of Lord Herbert of Cherburg , De Veritate , first published in 1633 . But the most famous work , with a similar title , was the Religio Medici of Thomas Browne , which was translated into Latin by Meryweather , and afterwards into French , Italian , Dutch , German , and most of the languages of Europe . In 1683 , Charles Blount , of Staffordshire , son to Sir Henry Blount , published a short treatise , entitled , Religio Laici , which he inscribed to his “ much honoured friend , John Dryden , Esq . ; ” whom he informed , in the epistle-dedicatory , “ I have endeavoured that my discourse should only be a continuance of yours ; and that , as you taught men how to believe , so I might instruct them how to live . "[ 5 ]</p>
   <p>It has been suggested , that the purpose of the Religio Laici of Dryden was to bring the contending factions to sober and philosophical reflection on their differences in points of faith , and to abate , if possible , the acrimony with which they contended upon the most obscure subjects of polemical divinity . But to attempt , by an abstracted disquisition on the original cause of quarrel , to stop a controversy , in which all the angry passions had been roused , and which indeed was fast verging towards blows , is as vain an attempt , as it would be to turn the course of a river , swoln with a thousand tributary streams , by draining the original spring-head . From the cold reception of this poem , compared to those political and personal satires which preceded it , Dryden might learn the difference of interest , excited by productions which tended to fan party rage , and one which was designed to mitigate its ferocity . The Religio Laici , which first appeared in November 1682 , neither attracted admiration nor censure ; it was neither hailed by the acclamations of the one party , nor attacked by the indignant answers of the other . The public were , however , sufficiently interested in it to call for a renewal of the impression in the following year . This second edition , which had escaped even the researches of Mr Malone , is in the collection of my friend Mr Heber . It might probably have been again reprinted with advantage , but our author 's change of faith must necessarily have rendered him unwilling to give a third edition . The same circumstance called the attention of his enemies towards this neglected poem , who , in many libels , upbraided him with the versatility of his religious opinions . The author of a pamphlet , called “ The Revolter , ” was at the pains to print the tenets of the Religio Laici concerning the Catholic controversy , in contrast with those which our author had adopted and expressed in the “ Hind and Panther . "[ 6 ] Another turned our author 's own title against him , and published “ Religio Laici , or a Layman 's Faith touching the Supream and Infallible Guide of the Church , by J. R. a Convert of Mr Bayes . In Two Letters to a Friend in the Country . Licenced June the 1st , 1688 . ” In both these pamphlets our author is treated with the grossest insolence and brutality .<span corresp="#note7" type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>Excepting these malignant criticisms , the Religio Laici slept in obscurity after the second edition , and was not again published till after the author 's death . Neither has it been since popular , although its pure spirit of Christianity should be acceptable to the religious , its moderation to the philosopher , and the excellence of the composition to all admirers of argumentative poetry .</p>

   <p>But , to give the devil his due , I must needs own Mr Bayes has a most powerful and luxurious hand at satire , and may challenge all Christendom to match him ; for indeed I never , in my slender province , met any that was worthy to compare to him , unless that unknown , but supposed worthy author , that writ to him upon his at last turning Roman Catholic ; for Bayes , like the Vicar of Bray , in Henry VIII . Edward VI . Queen Mary , and Queen Elizabeth 's times , was resolved to keep his place ; ( and the quoting an author to the purpose , is the same thing , the learned say , as if it was his own ) , and that will , I hope , excuse my putting them down here :—</p>

   <p>THE</p>
   <p>PREFACE .</p>
   <p>A Poem , with so bold a title , and a name prefixed from which the handling of so serious a subject would not be expected , may reasonably oblige the author to say somewhat in defence , both of himself and of his undertaking . In the first place , if it be objected to me , that , being a layman , I ought not to have concerned myself with speculations , which belong to the profession of divinity ; I could answer , that perhaps laymen , with equal advantages of parts and knowledge , are not the most incompetent judges of sacred things ; but , in the due sense of my own weakness , and want of learning , I plead not this ; I pretend not to make myself a judge of faith in others , but only to make a confession of my own . I lay no unhallowed hand upon the ark , but wait on it , with the reverence that becomes me , at a distance . In the next place , I will ingenuously confess , that the helps I have used in this small treatise , were many of them taken from the works of our own reverend divines of the church of England ; so that the weapons with which I combat irreligion , are already consecrated ; though I suppose they may be taken down as lawfully as the sword of Goliah was by David , when they are to be employed for the common cause against the enemies of piety . I intend not by this to entitle them to any of my errors , which yet I hope are only those of charity to mankind ; and such as my own charity has caused me to commit , that of others may more easily excuse . Being naturally inclined to scepticism in philosophy , I have no reason to impose my opinions in a subject which is above it ; but whatever they are , I submit them with all reverence to my mother church , accounting them no further mine , than as they are authorised , or at least uncondemned , by her . And , indeed , to secure myself on this side , I have used the necessary precaution of shewing this paper before it was published to a judicious and learned friend ; a man indefatigably zealous in the service of the church and state , and whose writings have highly deserved of both . He was pleased to approve the body of the discourse , and I hope he is more my friend than to do it out of complaisance : It is true , he had too good a taste to like it all ; and , amongst some other faults , recommended to my second view , what I have written , perhaps too boldly , on St Athanasius , which he advised me wholly to omit . I am sensible enough , that I had done more prudently to have followed his opinion ; but then I could not have satisfied myself , that I had done honestly not to have written what was my own . It has always been my thought , that heathens , who never did , nor without miracle could , hear of the name of Christ , were yet in a possibility of salvation . Neither will it enter easily into my belief , that before the coming of our Saviour , the whole world , excepting only the Jewish nation , should lie under the inevitable necessity of everlasting punishment , for want of that revelation , which was confined to so small a spot of ground as that of Palestine . Among the sons of Noah , we read of one only who was accursed ; and , if a blessing , in the ripeness of time , was reserved for Japhet , of whose progeny we are , it seems unaccountable to me , why so many generations of the same offspring , as preceded our Saviour in the flesh , should be all involved in one common condemnation , and yet that their posterity should be entitled to the hopes of salvation ; as if a bill of exclusion had passed only on the fathers , which debarred not the sons from their succession : or , that so many ages had been delivered over to hell , and so many reserved for heaven , and that the devil had the first choice , and God the next . Truly I am apt to think , that the revealed religion , which was taught by Noah to all his sons , might continue for some ages in the whole posterity . That afterwards it was included wholly in the family of Shem , is manifest ; but when the progenies of Cham and Japhet swarmed into colonies , and those colonies were subdivided into many others , in process of time their descendants lost , by little and little , the primitive and purer rites of divine worship , retaining only the notion of one deity ; to which succeeding generations added others ; for men took their degrees in those ages from conquerors to gods . Revelation being thus eclipsed to almost all mankind , the light of nature , as the next in dignity , was substituted ; and that is it which St Paul concludes to be the rule of the heathens , and by which they are hereafter to be judged . If my supposition be true , then the consequence , which I have assumed in my poem , may be also true ; namely , that Deism , or the principles of natural worship , are only faint remnants , or dying flames , of revealed religion , in the posterity of Noah ; and that our modern philosophers , nay , and some of our philosophising divines , have too much exalted the faculties of our souls , when they have maintained , that , by their force , mankind has been able to find out , that there is one supreme agent , or intellectual being , which we call God ; that praise and prayer are his due worship ; and the rest of those deducements , which I am confident are the remote effects of revelation , and unattainable by our discourse , I mean as simply considered , and without the benefit of divine illumination . So that we have not lifted up ourselves to God , by the weak pinions of our reason , but he has been pleased to descend to us ; and what Socrates said of him , what Plato writ , and the rest of the heathen philosophers of several nations , is all no more than the twilight of revelation , after the sun of it was set in the race of Noah . That there is something above us , some principle of motion , our reason can apprehend , though it cannot discover what it is by its own virtue : and , indeed , it is very improbable that we , who , by the strength of our faculties , cannot enter into the knowledge of any being , not so much as of our own , should be able to find out , by them , that supreme nature , which we cannot otherwise define , than by saying it is infinite ; as if infinite were definable , or infinity a subject for our narrow understanding . They , who would prove religion by reason , do but weaken the cause which they endeavour to support : it is to take away the pillars from our faith , and to prop it only with a twig ; it is to design a tower , like that of Babel , which , if it were possible , as it is not , to reach heaven , would come to nothing by the confusion of the workmen . For every man is building a several way ; impotently conceited of his own model and his own materials , reason is always striving , and always at a loss ; and of necessity it must so come to pass , while it is exercised about that which is not its proper object . Let us be content , at last , to know God by his own methods ; at least , so much of him as he is pleased to reveal to us in the sacred Scriptures . To apprehend them to be the word of God is all our reason has to do ; for all beyond it is the work of faith , which is the seal of heaven impressed upon our human understanding .</p>
   <p>And now for what concerns the holy Bishop Athanasius , the preface of whose creed seems inconsistent with my opinion , which is , that heathens may possibly be saved . In the first place , I desire it may be considered , that it is the preface only , not the creed itself , which , till I am better informed , is of too hard a digestion for my charity .<span corresp="#note8" type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>It is not that I am ignorant , how many several texts of Scripture seemingly support that cause ; but neither am I ignorant , how all those texts may receive a kinder , and more mollified interpretation . Every man , who is read in church history , knows that belief was drawn up after a long contestation with Arius , concerning the divinity of our blessed Saviour , and his being one substance with the Father ; and that thus compiled , it was sent abroad among the Christian churches , as a kind of test , which , whosoever took , was looked on as an orthodox believer .<span corresp="#note9" type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>It is manifest from hence , that the heathen part of the empire was not concerned in it ; for its business was not to distinguish betwixt Pagans and Christians , but betwixt heretics and true believers . This , well considered , takes off the heavy weight of censure , which I would willingly avoid from so venerable a man ; for if this proportion , “ whosoever will be saved , ” be restrained only to those to whom it was intended , and for whom it was composed , I mean the Christians ; then the anathema reaches not the heathens , who had never heard of Christ , and were nothing interested in that dispute . After all , I am far from blaming even that prefatory addition to the creed , and as far from cavilling at the continuation of it in the liturgy of the church , where , on the days appointed , it is publicly read : for I suppose there is the same reason for it now , in opposition to the Socinians , as there was then against the Arians ; the one being a heresy , which seems to have been refined out of the other ; and with how much more plausibility of reason it combats our religion , with so much more caution it ought to be avoided : therefore , the prudence of our church is to be commended , which has interposed her authority for the recommendation of this creed . Yet to such as are grounded in the true belief , those explanatory creeds , the Nicene and this of Athanasius , might perhaps be spared ; for what is supernatural will always be a mystery in spite of exposition ; and , for my own part , the plain Apostles creed is most suitable to my weak understanding , as the simplest diet is the most easy of digestion .</p>
   <p>I have dwelt longer on this subject than I intended , and longer than perhaps I ought ; for , having laid down , as my foundation , that the Scripture is a rule ; that in all things needful to salvation it is clear , sufficient , and ordained by God Almighty for that purpose ; I have left myself no right to interpret obscure places , such as concern the possibility of eternal happiness to heathens ; because whatsoever is obscure is concluded not necessary to be known .</p>
   <p>But , by asserting the Scripture to be the canon of our faith , I have unavoidably created to myself two sorts of enemies ; the papists , indeed , more directly , because they have kept the Scripture from us what they could , and have reserved to themselves a right of interpreting what they have delivered under the pretence of infallibility ; and the fanatics , more collaterally , because they have assumed what amounts to an infallibility in the private spirit , and have distorted those texts of Scripture which are not necessary to salvation , to the damnable uses of sedition , disturbance , and destruction of the civil government . To begin with the papists , and to speak freely , I think them the less dangerous ( at least in appearance ) to our present state ; for not only the penal laws are in force against them , and their number is contemptible , but also their peerage and commons are excluded from parliaments , and consequently those laws in no probability of being repealed . A general and uninterrupted plot of their clergy , ever since the Reformation , I suppose all protestants believe ; for it is not reasonable to think , but that so many of their orders , as were outed from their fat possessions , would endeavour a re-entrance against those whom they account heretics .<span corresp="#note10" type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>As for the late design , Mr Coleman 's letters , for aught I know , are the best evidence ; and what they discover , without wire-drawing their sense , or malicious glosses , all men of reason conclude credible .<span corresp="#note11" type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>If there be any thing more than this required of me , I must believe it as well as I am able , in spite of the witnesses , and out of a decent conformity to the votes of parliament ; for I suppose the fanatics will not allow the private spirit in this case . Here the infallibility is at least in one part of the government ; and our understandings , as well as our wills , are represented . But , to return to the Roman Catholics , how can we be secure from the practice of jesuited papists in that religion ? For not two or three of that order , as some of them would impose upon us , but almost the whole body of them , are of opinion , that their infallible master has a right over kings , not only in spirituals , but temporals . Not to name Mariana , Bellarmine , Emanuel Sa , Molina , Santarel , Simancha ,<span corresp="#note12" type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span>and at least twenty others of foreign countries , we can produce of our own nation , Campian , and Doleman or Parsons ,<span corresp="#note13" type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span>( besides many [ who ] are named whom I have not read ,) who all of them attest this doctrine , that the pope can depose and give away the right of any sovereign prince , si vel paulum deflexerit , if he shall never so little warp ; but if he once comes to be excommunicated , then the bond of obedience is taken off from subjects ; and they may and ought to drive him , like another Nebuchadnezzar , ex hominum Christianorum dominatu , from exercising dominion over Christians ; and to this they are bound by virtue of divine precept , and by all the ties of conscience , under no less penalty than damnation . If they answer me , ( as a learned priest has lately written ,) that this doctrine of the Jesuits is not de fide , and that consequently they are not obliged by it , they must pardon me , if I think they have said nothing to the purpose ; for it is a maxim in their church , where points of faith are not decided , and that doctors are of contrary opinions , they may follow which part they please , but more safely the most received and most authorized . And their champion , Bellarmine , has told the world , in his Apology , that the king of England is a vassal to the pope , ratione , directi dominii ,<span corresp="#note14" type="note_anchor">[ 14 ]</span>and that he holds in villanage of his Roman landlord ; which is no new claim put in for England : our chronicles are his authentic witnesses , that King John was deposed by the same plea , and Philip Augustus admitted tenant ; and , which makes the more for Bellarmine , the French king was again ejected when our king submitted to the church , and the crown received under the sordid condition of a vassalage .</p>
   <p>It is not sufficient for the more moderate and well-meaning papists , of which I doubt not there are many , to produce the evidences of their loyalty to the late king , and to declare their innocency in this plot . I will grant their behaviour in the first to have been as loyal and as brave as they desire ; and will be willing to hold them excused as to the second , ( I mean when it comes to my turn , and after my betters ; for it is a madness to be sober alone , while the nation continues drunk :) but that saying of their father Cres .<span corresp="#note15" type="note_anchor">[ 15 ]</span>is still running in my head ,— that they may be dispensed with in their obedience to an heretic prince , while the necessity of the times shall oblige them to it ; ( for that , as another of them tells us , is only the effect of Christian prudence ;) but when once they shall get power to shake him off , an heretic is no lawful king , and consequently to rise against him is no rebellion . I should be glad , therefore , that they would follow the advice which was charitably given them by a reverend prelate of our church , namely , that they would join in a public act of disowning and detesting those jesuitic principles , and subscribe to all doctrines which deny the pope 's authority of deposing kings , and releasing subjects from their oath of allegiance ; to which , I should think , they might easily be induced , if it be true , that this present pope has condemned the doctrine of king-killing ; a thesis of the Jesuits , maintained , amongst others , ex cathedra , as they call it , or in open consistory .</p>
   <p>Leaving them , therefore , in so fair a way , ( if they please themselves ,) of satisfying all reasonable men of their sincerity and good meaning to the government , I shall make bold to consider that other extreme of our religion , I mean the fanatics , or schismatics , of the English church . Since the Bible has been translated into our tongue , they have used it so , as if their business was not to be saved , but to be damned by its contents . If we consider only them , better had it been for the English nation , that it had still remained in the original Greek and Hebrew , or at least in the honest Latin of St Jerome , than that several texts in it should have been prevaricated to the destruction of that government , which put it into so ungrateful hands .</p>
   <p>How many heresies the first translation of Tyndal<span corresp="#note16" type="note_anchor">[ 16 ]</span>produced in few years , let my Lord Herbert 's History of Henry the Eighth inform you ; insomuch that , for the gross errors in it , and the great mischiefs it occasioned , a sentence passed on the first edition of the Bible , too shameful almost to be repeated .<span corresp="#note17" type="note_anchor">[ 17 ]</span>After the short reign of Edward the Sixth , ( who had continued to carry on the Reformation on other principles than it was begun ,) every one knows , that not only the chief promoters of that work , but many others , whose consciences would not dispense with popery , were forced , for fear of persecution , to change climates ; from whence returning at the beginning of Queen Elizabeth 's reign , many of them , who had been in France , and at Geneva , brought back the rigid opinions and imperious discipline of Calvin , to graft upon our Reformation ;<span corresp="#note18" type="note_anchor">[ 18 ]</span>which , though they cunningly concealed at first , ( as well knowing how nauseously that drug would go down in a lawful monarchy , which was prescribed for a rebellious commonwealth ,) yet they always kept it in reserve ; and were never wanting to themselves , either in court or parliament , when either they had any prospect of a numerous party of fanatic members in the one , or the encouragement of any favourite in the other , whose covetousness was gaping at the patrimony of the church . They who will consult the works of our venerable Hooker ,<span corresp="#note19" type="note_anchor">[ 19 ]</span>or the account of his life , or more particularly the letter written to him on this subject , by George Cranmer ,<span corresp="#note20" type="note_anchor">[ 20 ]</span>may see by what gradations they proceeded ; from the dislike of cap and surplice , the very next step was admonitions to the parliament against the whole government ecclesiastical ; then came out volumes in English and Latin in defence of their tenets ; and immediately practices were set on foot to erect their discipline without authority . Those not succeeding , satire and railing was the next ; and Martin Mar-prelate ,<span corresp="#note21" type="note_anchor">[ 21 ]</span>( the Marvel of those times ,) was the first presbyterian scribbler , who sanctified libels and scurrility to the use of the good old cause : which was done , ( says my author ,) upon this account , that their serious treatises having been fully answered and refuted , they might compass by railing what they had lost by reasoning ; and , when their cause was sunk in court and parliament , they might at least hedge in a stake amongst the rabble , for to their ignorance all things are wit which are abusive ; but if church and state were made the theme , then the doctoral degree of wit was to be taken at Billingsgate ; even the most saintlike of the party , though they durst not excuse this contempt and vilifying of the government , yet were pleased , and grinned at it with a pious smile , and called it a judgment of God against the hierarchy . Thus sectaries , we may see , were born with teeth , foul-mouthed , and scurrilous from their infancy ; and if spiritual pride , venom , violence , contempt of superiors , and slander , had been the marks of orthodox belief , the presbytery , and the rest of our schismatics , which are their spawn , were always the most visible church in the Christian world .<span corresp="#note22" type="note_anchor">[ 22 ]</span></p>
   <p>It is true , the government was too strong at that time for a rebellion ; but , to shew what proficiency they had made in Calvin 's school , even then their mouths watered at it ; for two of their gifted brotherhood , Hacket and Coppinger , as the story tells us , got up in a pease-cart and harangued the people , to dispose them to an insurrection , and to establish their discipline by force ;<span corresp="#note23" type="note_anchor">[ 23 ]</span>so that , however it comes about , that now they celebrate Queen Elizabeth 's birth-night , as that of their saint and patroness ; yet then they were for doing the work of the Lord by arms against her ;<span corresp="#note24" type="note_anchor">[ 24 ]</span>and in all probability they wanted but a fanatic lord-mayor , and two sheriffs of their party , to have compassed it .<span corresp="#note25" type="note_anchor">[ 25 ]</span></p>
   <p>Our venerable Hooker , after many admonitions which he had given them , towards the end of his preface , breaks out into this prophetic speech : “ There is in every one of these considerations most just cause to fear , lest our hastiness to embrace a thing of so perilous consequence , ( meaning the presbyterian discipline ,) should cause posterity to feel those evils , which as yet are more easy for us to prevent , than they would be for them to remedy . ”</p>
   <p>How fatally this Cassandra has foretold , we know too well by sad experience . The seeds were sown in the time of Queen Elizabeth ; the bloody harvest ripened in the reign of King Charles the Martyr ; and , because all the sheaves could not be carried off without shedding some of the loose grains , another crop is too like to follow ; nay , I fear it is unavoidable , if the conventiclers be permitted still to scatter .</p>
   <p>A man may be suffered to quote an adversary to our religion , when he speaks truth ; and it is the observation of Maimbourg ,<span corresp="#note26" type="note_anchor">[ 26 ]</span>in his “ History of Calvinism , ” that wherever that discipline was planted and embraced , rebellion , civil war , and misery , attended it . And how indeed should it happen otherwise ? Reformation of church and state has always been the ground of our divisions in England . While we were papists , our Holy Father rid us , by pretending authority out of the Scriptures to depose princes ; when we shook off his authority , the sectaries furnished themselves with the same weapons , and out of the same magazine , the Bible ; so that the Scriptures , which are in themselves the greatest security of governors , as commanding express obedience to them , are now turned to their destruction ; and never since the Reformation has there wanted a text of their interpreting to authorize a rebel . And it is to be noted by the way , that the doctrines of king-killing and deposing , which have been taken up only by the worst party of the Papists , the most frontless flatterers of the pope 's authority , have been espoused , defended , and are still maintained , by the whole body of nonconformists and republicans . It is but dubbing themselves the people of God , which it is the interest of their preachers to tell them they are , and their own interest to believe , and after that , they cannot dip into the Bible , but one text or another will turn up for their purpose : if they are under persecution , as they call it , then that is a mark of their election ; if they flourish , then God works miracles for their deliverance , and the saints are to possess the earth .</p>
   <p>They may think themselves to be too roughly handled in this paper ; but I , who know best how far I could have gone on this subject , must be bold to tell them , they are spared ; though , at the same time , I am not ignorant , that they interpret the mildness of a writer to them , as they do the mercy of the government ; in the one they think it fear , and conclude it weakness in the other . The best way for them to confute me is , as I before advised the Papists , to disclaim their principles , and renounce their practices . We shall all be glad to think them true Englishmen , when they obey the king ; and true Protestants , when they conform to the church-discipline .</p>
   <p>It remains that I acquaint the reader , that the verses were written for an ingenious young gentleman , my friend , upon his translation of “ The Critical History of the Old Testament , ” composed by the learned father Simon :[ 27 ] the verses , therefore , are addressed to the translator of that work , and the style of them is , what it ought to be , epistolary .<span corresp="#note28" type="note_anchor">[ 28 ]</span></p>
   <p>If any one be so lamentable a critic as to require the smoothness , the numbers , and the turn of heroic poetry in this poem , I must tell him , that if he has not read Horace , I have studied him , and hope the style of his epistles is not ill imitated here . The expressions of a poem , designed purely for instruction , ought to be plain and natural , and yet majestic ; for here the poet is presumed to be a kind of lawgiver , and those three qualities , which I have named , are proper to the legislative style . The florid , elevated , and figurative way , is for the passions ; for love and hatred , fear and anger , are begotten in the soul , by shewing their objects out of their true proportion , either greater than the life , or less ; but instruction is to be given by shewing them what they naturally are . A man is to be cheated into passion , but to be reasoned into truth .</p>

   <note xml:id="note9" place="bottom" n="9">The controversy between Athanasius and Arius long divided the Christian church . The former was patriarch of Alexandria , and the latter bishop of Nicomedia , in Asia . The dispute regarded the godhead of the Trinity . The doctrine of Arius , that God the Son was not co-existent , consequently , not equal in dignity with God the Father , was condemned by the grand general council of Nice , and he was banished . But he was afterwards recalled by the emperor ; and his heresy spread so widely , that almost all the Christian world were at one time Arians . As a test of the true orthodox doctrine , Athanasius composed the creed which goes by his name . Being written expressly for this purpose , and for the exclusive use of the Christian world , Dryden argues , with great apparent justice , that the anathema with which it is fenced , has no relation to the heathens , and that we cannot , with charity , or even logically , argue from thence concerning their state in the next world .</note>

   <note xml:id="note11" place="bottom" n="11">The unfortunate Edward Coleman was secretary to the Duke of York , and in high favour with his master . With the intriguing spirit of a courtier , and the zeal of a Catholic , he had long carried on a correspondence with Father La Chaise , confessor to the king of France , with the Pope 's nuncio , and with other Catholics abroad , for the purpose , as he himself states it , of “ the conversion of three kingdoms , and by that , perhaps , the utter subduing of a pestilent heresy , which has a long time domineered over a great part of the northern world . ” It would seem , from these letters , that it was the purpose of the Catholics , to begin by obtaining , if possible , a toleration , or exemption from the penal laws ; and then , while strengthening themselves by new converts , to await the succession of James , or the open declaration of Charles in favour of their religion . From various points it appears , that Coleman was a better Catholic than an Englishman ; and would not have hesitated to sacrifice the interests of his country to France , if , by so doing , he could have brought her faith nearer to Rome . There were also indications of both the king 's and duke 's accessibility to foreign influence , which were fraught with consequences highly dangerous to the country . But , while the Catholics were availing themselves of these unworthy dispositions in the royal brothers , it was quite absurd to suppose , that they should have forfeited every prospect of success , by assassinating these very persons , upon whose lives their whole plan depended , to place upon the throne the Prince of Orange , the head of the Protestant League . Yet , although not the least trace is to be found in Coleman 's letters of the murders , invasions , fires , and massacres , which Oates and Bedloe bore witness to , the real and imaginary conspiracy were identified by the general prepossession of the nation ; and Coleman , who undoubtedly deserved death for his unlawful and treasonable trafficking with foreign interests against the religion and liberty of his country , actually suffered for a plot which was totally chimerical .</note>

   <note xml:id="note16" place="bottom" n="16">The passage in Lord Herbert 's history , referred to by Dryden , seems to be that which follows :</note>
   <p>“ For as the scriptures began then commonly to be read , so out of the literal sense thereof , the manner of those times was , promiscuously to draw arguments , for whatsoever in matter of state or otherwise was to be done . Insomuch , that the text which came nearest the point in question , was taken as a decision of the business ; to the no little detriment of their affairs : The scriptures not pretending yet to give regular instructions in those points . But this is so much less strange , that the year preceding , the Scriptures ( heretofore not permitted to the view of the people ) were now translated in divers languages , and into English , by Tindal , Joy , and others , though , as not being warranted by the king 's authority , they were publickly burnt , and a new and better translation promised to be set forth , and allowed to the people . It being not thought fit by our king , that under what pretence or difficulty soever , his subjects should be defrauded of that , wherein was to be found the word of God , and means of their salvation . Howbeit not a few inconveniences were observed to follow . For as the people did not sufficiently separate the more clear and necessary parts thereof , from the obscure and accessory ; and as again taking the several authors to be equally inspired , they did equally apply themselves to all ; they fell into many dangerous opinions : Little caring how they lived , so they understood well , bringing religion thus into much irresolution and controversie , while few men agreeing on the same interpretation of the harder places , vexed each others conscience , appropriating to themselves the gift of the spirit . Whereof the Roman church , ( much perplext at first with these defections ) did at last avail itself ; as assuming alone the power of that decision , which yet was used more in favour of themselves , than such an analogy , as ought to be found in so perfect a book . So that few were satisfied therewith , but such as , renouncing their own judgment , and submitting to theirs , yielded themselves wholly to an implicit faith ; in which , though they found an apparent ease , yet as , for justifying of themselves , the authority of their belief was derived more immediately from the church , than the scripture , not a few difficulties were introduced , concerning both : While the more speculative sort could not imagine , how to hold that as an infallible rule , which needed humane help to vindicate and support it ; nevertheless , as by frequent reading of the scripture at this time , it generally appeared what the Roman church had added or altered in religion , so many recovered a just liberty , endeavouring together a reformation of the doctrine and manners of the clergy , which yet , through the obstinacy of some , succeeded worse , than so pious intentions deserved . ” ]</p>
   <note xml:id="note17" place="bottom" n="17">William Tyndal , otherwise called Hitchens , was born on the borders of Wales , and educated at Oxford . He was one of the earliest Protestants , and so boldly maintained the doctrines of the Reformation , that he was obliged to leave England . He employed himself , while abroad , in executing a translation , first of the New Testament , and afterwards of the Pentateuch , with prologues to the different books . But as he was a zealous Lutheran , and as it had not pleased King Henry VIII . that his subjects should become Protestants , though they had ceased to be Papists , Tyndal 's version of the New Testament was publickly burned , and prohibited by royal proclamation , as tending to disturb the brains of weak persons . This grossly indecorous expression was not altogether without foundation . A rule of faith , containing the most sublime doctrines both of faith and moral practice , and which had long been acknowledged the only guide to heaven , could not be exposed at once to the vulgar , who had been bred up in the grossest ignorance of its nature and contents , without dazzling and confounding them , as the beams of the sun suddenly let in upon the inmates of an obscure dungeon . It was not till the sacred Scriptures , with the expositions of judicious pastors , became a part of the regular education of the people , that their minds were duly prepared to make the proper use of that inestimable gift .</note>
   <p>The fate of Tyndal was melancholy enough . By the influence of Henry , he was seized at Brussels ; and , under pretence of his being a pragmatical incendiary , one of the first translators of the New Testament was strangled and burned , at Filford castle , about twenty miles from Antwerp , in 1536 . His last words were , “ Lord , open the king of England 's eyes . ” ]</p>
   <note xml:id="note18" place="bottom" n="18">Heylin says , the reformation would have rested with the first public liturgy , confirmed by act of parliament in the second and third years of Edward VI ., “ if Calvin 's pragmatical spirit had not interposed . He first began to quarrel at some passages in this sacred liturgy , and afterwards never left soliciting the lord protector , and practising , by his agents , on the court , the country , and the universities , till he had laid the first foundation of the Zuinglian faction , who laboured nothing more than innovation both in doctrine and discipline . ” — Ecclesia Restaurata . Address to the Reader .</note>
   <note xml:id="note19" place="bottom" n="19">The learned and judicious Richard Hooker , one of the most eminent divines of the church of England , wrote a treatise upon Ecclesiastical Policy , in which he vindicates that communion , both against the Puritans and Papists . It is in eight books ; five were published during Hooker 's lifetime , and the other three after his death . The last are supposed to be interpolated , as they bear some passages tending to impugn the doctrine of non-resistance , which at that time was a shibboleth of orthodoxy . Hooker died in 1600 . His Life , to which Dryden refers , was written by the worthy Isaac Walton , better known as the author of the “ Complete Angler ; ” a delightful work , where the innocent simplicity , unclouded cheerfulness , and real worth of the author , beam through every page . His Life of Hooker was published about 1662 . See HAWKIN 'S edition of the Complete Angler , Introduction , p. 19 . Athenæ Oxon . Vol . I. p. 302 .</note>
   <note xml:id="note20" place="bottom" n="20">George Cranmer , whom Wood calls a gentleman of singular hopes , was grandson to Edmund Cranmer , arch-deacon of Canterbury , brother to Thomas the primate , who suffered martyrdom in the reign of Queen Mary . He was bred to state affairs under Secretary Davison ; and after serving in various diplomatic capacities , became secretary to Lord Mountjoy , Lieutenant of Ireland . On the 13th November , 1600 , Cranmer was slain in a skirmish at Carlingford between the English and the forces of Tyrone . Camden thus records his death : “ Cecidit tamen ex Anglis , præter alios , Cranmerus , Proregi ab epistolis , et ipsi eo nomine longe charissimus . ” He wrote to Hooker , under whom he had studied , the letter mentioned in the text concerning the new church discipline , which is dated February 1598 . It is inserted by Walton in his Life of Hooker . Athenæ Oxon . Vol . I. p. 306 .</note>
   <note xml:id="note21" place="bottom" n="21">John Penry , or Ap Henry , better known by the name of Martin Mar-prelate , or Mar-priest , as having been a plague to the bishops and clergy of his time . He was a native of Wales , and originally a sub-sizer of Peter-house , in Cambridge . Afterwards he obtained the degree of Master of Arts in Oxford , and , having taken orders , was for some time a regular clergyman . But being a person “ full of Welch blood , of a hot and restless head , ” Anthony Wood tells us , he became a furious Anabaptist , and the most bitter enemy to the church of England that appeared in the long reign of Queen Elizabeth . He wrote a great number of pestilent pamphlets , with burlesque titles ; such as , “ Oh , read over John Bridges , for it is a worthy work . Printed over sea , in Europe , within two furlongs of a bouncing Priest , at the cost of Martin Mar-prelate , gent . ” All his writings were filled with the most virulent invectives against the Episcopal church . At length , being apprehended , and tried for writing and publishing infamous books and libels against the established religion , he was condemned and executed at St Thomas a Watering , 29th May , 1593 . Dryden compares him to Andrew Marvel , the well known opposer of the court , during the reign of Charles II .</note>
   <note xml:id="note22" place="bottom" n="22">The court writers at this period were anxious to fix upon the presbyterians and the non-conformists in general , the anti-monarchical principles of the fanatics , who brought Charles I. to the scaffold . Their arguments may be seen at length in a book entitled , “ Seditious Teachers , ungodly Preachers exemplified . ” These charges are carried too far ; yet as the Episcopalians made church and king their watchword , the fanatics , on the contrary , in England , and the Huguenots in France , had a certain tendency to oppose monarchical government . One of their authors , as early as the reign of Queen Elizabeth , maintains , that if kings and princes refused to reform religion , the inferior magistrates or people , by direction of the ministry , might lawfully , and ought , if need required , even by force of arms , to reform it themselves .— Whittingham 's Preface to Goodman on Obedience to Superior Powers .</note>
   <note xml:id="note23" place="bottom" n="23">The freaks of these unhappy enthusiasts may be seen in the histories of the time . Hacket , a man of some learning , had his brain turned by enthusiasm , and seduced Coppinger and Arthington , two fanatic preachers , by his example and exhortation , to sally forth into the streets of London , where he proclaimed himself to be the Messiah , and Coppinger and Arthington , his prophet of mercy , and his prophet of judgment . As they continued to utter the most horrible blasphemies , and to exhort the citizens to take arms , to further the reign of Hacket , who , they said , was come with his fan in his hand to purify the discipline of the church of England , they were seized and lodged in prison . Hacket was executed , though fitter for Bedlam , persisting to the last in the most insane blasphemy . The discipline of the prison restored Arthington to his senses , and he published a recantation , expressing great remorse for his errors . Coppinger starved himself to death in jail . This explosion of madness took place in 1591 . Hacket is stated by Camden to have been a determined enemy to Queen Elizabeth , and to have stabbed her picture with his dagger .</note>
   <note xml:id="note24" place="bottom" n="24">The birth-night of Queen Elizabeth was that which the Whigs chose to solemnize , by their grand pope-burnings and processions ; considering her as the patron of the Protestant religion . Yet Queen Elizabeth was very severe against the Puritans , and passed several statutes against them .</note>

   <note xml:id="note26" place="bottom" n="26">Lewis Maimbourg , a secularized Jesuit , wrote a History of Calvinism , in which he charges upon the Huguenots the principal share of the guilt of the civil wars of France . He charges them particularly with the conspiracies of Amboise and Meaux against the crown ; and alleges , it was their intention , by the assistance of England , and the Protestant states of Germany , with whom they corresponded , to establish a republic in France . His arguments are controverted in an “ Apology for the Protestants of France , in six letters . ” London , 1683 .</note>
   <note xml:id="note27" place="bottom" n="27">Pere Richard Simon was an excellent Orientalist . He was an oratorian priest , and published , besides the work here mentioned , “ A critical History of the New Testament , ” and a new Version of it , which was censured by Cardinal de Noailles , Archbishop of Paris , and opposed by Bossuet , the learned Bishop of Meaux . Pere Simon was an able biblical critic , an excellent scholar , and one of the most learned divines of his age .</note>
   <note xml:id="note28" place="bottom" n="28">Derrick erroneously states this young gentleman to have been Hampden , son of the famous parliamentary leader , who was deeply engaged in the Rye-house Plot , and some years afterwards killed himself . Dryden was not likely , in the very hottest of his political controversy , to be on very intimate habits with a leader of the Whigs , much less to inscribe to him a poem , the preface of which , at least , is levelled against the most zealous of that party . Besides , the translation of Pere Simon 's Critical History , which was published in 1682 , bears to have been made by H. D. which initials can hardly stand for John Hampden . Mr Malone conjectures he may have been of the Digby family , or perhaps Mr Dodswell , who translated one of Plutarch 's Lives , But it appears , from a poem addressed to the Translator by Duke , that his name was Henry Dickinson , probably a son of Edmund Dickinson , a physician , and author of the Delphi Phenecizantes , and other learned pieces . Athenæ Oxon . Vol . II . p. 946 . There is another copy of verses , addressed to the Translator of the “ Critical History ” in Dryden 's “ Miscellanies . ” So that Dickinson 's work seems to have attracted much notice at the time of its publication .</note>

     <l n="55">Are variously dispensed to human kind ;</l>
     <l n="56">That vice triumphs , and virtue suffers here ,</l>
     <l n="57">A brand that sovereign justice cannot bear ;</l>
     <l n="58">Our reason prompts us to a future state ,</l>
     <l n="59">The last appeal from fortune and from fate ,</l>
     <l n="60">Where God 's all righteous ways will be declared ;</l>
     <l n="61">The bad meet punishment , the good reward .</l>
     <l n="62">Thus man by his own strength to heaven would soar ,</l>
     <l n="63">And would not be obliged to God for more .</l>
     <l n="64">Vain wretched creature , how art thou misled ,</l>

     <l n="66">These truths are not the product of thy mind ,</l>
     <l n="67">But dropt from heaven , and of a nobler kind .</l>
     <l n="68">Revealed religion first informed thy sight ,</l>
     <l n="69">And reason saw not till faith sprung the light .</l>
     <l n="70">Hence all thy natural worship takes the source ;</l>
     <l n="71">‘ Tis revelation what thou think'st discourse .</l>
     <l n="72">Else how com'st thou to see these truths so clear ,</l>
     <l n="73">Which so obscure to heathens did appear ?</l>
     <l n="74">Not Plato these , nor Aristotle found ,</l>
     <l n="75">Nor he whose wisdom oracles renowned .</l>
     <l n="76">Hast thou a wit so deep , or so sublime ,</l>
     <l n="77">Or canst thou lower dive , or higher climb ?</l>
     <l n="78">Canst thou by reason more of godhead know</l>
     <l n="79">Than Plutarch , Seneca , or Cicero ?</l>
     <l n="80">Those giant wits , in happier ages born ,</l>
     <l n="81">When arms and arts did Greece and Rome adorn ,</l>
     <l n="82">Knew no such system ; no such piles could raise</l>
     <l n="83">Of natural worship , built on prayer and praise</l>
     <l n="84">To one sole God ;</l>
     <l n="85">Nor did remorse to expiate sin prescribe ,</l>
     <l n="86">But slew their fellow-creatures for a bribe :</l>
     <l n="87">The guiltless victim groaned for their offence ,</l>
     <l n="88">And cruelty and blood was penitence .</l>
     <l n="89">If sheep and oxen could atone for men ,</l>
     <l n="90">Ah ! at how cheap a rate the rich might sin !</l>
     <l n="91">And great oppressors might heaven 's wrath beguile ,</l>
     <l n="92">By offering his own creatures for a spoil !</l>
     <l n="93">Darest thou , poor worm , offend Infinity ?</l>
     <l n="94">And must the terms of peace be given by thee ?</l>
     <l n="95">Then thou art justice in the last appeal ;</l>
     <l n="96">Thy easy God instructs thee to rebel ;</l>
     <l n="97">And , like a king remote and weak , must take</l>
     <l n="98">What satisfaction thou art pleased to make .</l>
     <l n="99">But if there be a Power too just and strong ,</l>
     <l n="100">To wink at crimes , and bear unpunished wrong ;</l>
     <l n="101">Look humbly upward , see his will disclose</l>
     <l n="102">The forfeit first , and then the fine impose ;</l>
     <l n="103">A mulct thy poverty could never pay ,</l>
     <l n="104">Had not Eternal Wisdom found the way ,</l>
     <l n="105">And with celestial wealth supplied thy store ;</l>
     <l n="106">His justice makes the fine , his mercy quits the score .</l>
     <l n="107">See God descending in thy human frame ;</l>
     <l n="108">The offended suffering in the offender 's name ;</l>
     <l n="109">All thy misdeeds to him imputed see ,</l>
     <l n="110">And all his righteousness devolved on thee .</l>
     <l n="111">For , granting we have sinned , and that the offence</l>
     <l n="112">Of man is made against Omnipotence ,</l>
     <l n="113">Some price that bears proportion must be paid .</l>
     <l n="114">And infinite with infinite be weighed .</l>
     <l n="115">See then the Deist lost : remorse for vice</l>
     <l n="116">Not paid , or paid inadequate in price :</l>
     <l n="117">What farther means can reason now direct ,</l>
     <l n="118">Or what relief from human wit expect ?</l>
     <l n="119">That shews us sick ; and sadly are we sure</l>
     <l n="120">Still to be sick , till heaven reveal the cure :</l>
     <l n="121">If then heaven 's will must needs be understood ,</l>
     <l n="122">Which must , if we want cure , and heaven be good ,</l>
     <l n="123">Let all records of will revealed be shown ;</l>
     <l n="124">With scripture all in equal balance thrown ,</l>

     <l n="129">In various ages , various countries bore ,</l>
     <l n="130">With christian faith and virtues , we shall find</l>
     <l n="131">None answering the great ends of human kind ,</l>
     <l n="132">But this one rule of life ; that shews us best</l>
     <l n="133">How God may be appeased , and mortals blest .</l>
     <l n="134">Whether from length of time its worth we draw ,</l>
     <l n="135">The word is scarce more ancient than the law :</l>

     <l n="146">If on the book itself we cast our view ,</l>
     <l n="147">Concurrent heathens prove the story true :</l>
     <l n="148">The doctrine , miracles ; which must convince ,</l>
     <l n="149">For heaven in them appeals to human sense ;</l>
     <l n="150">And , though they prove not , they confirm the cause ,</l>

     <l n="169">No supernatural worship can be true ;</l>

    <head>THRENODIA AUGUSTALIS :</head>
    <head>A</head>
    <head>FUNERAL PINDARIC POEM ,</head>
    <head>SACRED TO THE</head>
    <head>HAPPY MEMORY OF</head>
    <head>KING CHARLES II .</head>
     <l n="1">Fortunati ambo si quid mea carmina possunt ,</l>
     <l n="2">Nulla dies unquam memori vos eximet ævo !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>THRENODIA AUGUSTALIS .</p>
   <p>The death of Charles II . was sudden and unexpected . After he had apparently completely subdued the popular party , and was preparing , as has been confidently alleged , a similar conquest over the high-flying followers of the Duke of York , in the midst of his present triumph and future projects , he was , on the morning of the 2d February , 1684-5 , seized with a sudden fit , which resembled an apoplexy . He was bled by one King , a chemist , who happened to be in waiting , and experienced a temporary relief . From the 2d till the 6th , he continued in a languishing state , the Duke of York being in constant attendance on his death-bed . On the forenoon of the 6th , Charles died , to the general grief of his subjects , by whom he was personally beloved , and who had reason to fear , that his worst public measures would be followed out with more rigour by his successor .</p>
   <p>A numerous host of rhymers stepped forward with their condolences upon this event .<span corresp="#note37" type="note_anchor">[ 37 ]</span>Among these , we find few eminent names besides that of Dryden . Otway , indeed , has left a poem on the subject , called “ Windsor Castle ; ” and he began a pastoral , which , fortunately for his reputation , he left unfinished .<span corresp="#note38" type="note_anchor">[ 38 ]</span>From the laureat a deeper tone of lamentation was due . But whether the sense of discharging a task , a sense so chilling always to poetical imagination , had fettered Dryden 's powers , or from whatever other reason , his funeral pindaric has not been esteemed one of his happiest lyric effusions . It is devoid of any appearance of deep feeling on the part of the author himself . This is the more remarkable , as the manners of Charles were eminently calculated to attract affection , and Dryden had been admitted to a greater share of royal intercourse than is usually necessary to excite the personal attachment of a subject to a condescending monarch . But whether Dryden , as he is sometimes believed to have owned , was unapt to feel or express the more tender passions , or whether he saw the character of Charles so closely , as to discern the selfishness of his hollow courtesy , it is certain that the poet seems wonderfully little interested in the sorrowful theme . Even when he mentions his literary intercourse with the deceased monarch , he does not suppress a murmur , that he was niggard in rewarding the muses whom he loved ; that</p>
   <p>—— little was their hire , and light their gain .</p>
   <p>This absence of personal feeling on the part of the author , spreads a coldness over the whole elegy ; which we regret the less , as the pensioned monarch ill deserved a deeper lamentation . It is chiefly owing to this want of sympathy , connected with an over indulgence in conceit , a fault which immediately flows from the other , being an effort of ingenuity to supply the want of passion , that the “ Threnodia Augustalis ” has been neglected . We have to lament some overstrained metaphors and similes . The sun went back ten degrees in the dial of Ahaz ; a miraculous sign that Hezekiah was to live ; and this is compared to the five days during which the disease of Charles gained ground , until it was obvious that he was to die . The prayers of the people carrying heaven by storm , and almost forcing heaven to revoke his decrees , is extravagant , not to say profane . Yet , with all its faults of coldness and conceit , this poem seems rather to have been under-rated . It appears to great advantage , when compared with others on the same subject . Otway , who affects a warmer display of passion , a particular in which Dryden is said to have acknowledged his superiority , has fallen into the opposite fault , of describing the death-bed rather of a tender husband or lover , attended by his wife or mistress , than that of a king waited on by his successor .<span corresp="#note39" type="note_anchor">[ 39 ]</span>Dryden 's picture of the duke 's grief is much more appropriate and striking :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Horror in all his pomp was there ,</l>
     <l n="2">Mute and magnificent , without a tear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">The joy of the people upon the fallacious prospect of the king 's</l>
     <l n="4">recovery , is also a striking picture :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">Men met each other with erected look ;</l>
     <l n="6">The steps were higher that they took ;</l>
     <l n="7">Friends to congratulate their friends made haste ,</l>
     <l n="8">And long inveterate foes saluted as they past .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>There are many other fine passages in the “ Threnodia ; ” though the general effect is less impressive than might have been expected . The description in the thirteenth stanza , for example , of the effects on poetry and literature produced by the Restoration , and that of the return of liberty ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Without whose charms even peace would be</l>
     <l n="2">But a dull quiet slavery ,</l>
   </lg>
   <p>are both striking .— The character of Charles ; his wit , parts , and powers of conversation ; his gentle manners , and firmness of disposition , which , like a well-wrought blade , kept , even in yielding , the native toughness of the steel ,— are all themes of panegyric , which , though perhaps exaggerated , are well-chosen , and exquisitely brought out . It is indeed a peculiar attribute of Dryden 's praise , that it is always appropriate ; while the gross adulation of his contemporaries gave indiscriminately the same broad features to all their subjects , and thereby very often converted their intended panegyric into satire , not the less bitter because undesigned . Dryden , for instance , in this whole poem has never once mentioned the queen ; sensible that the gaiety of Charles ’ life , and his frequent amours , rendered her conjugal grief , which some of the elegiasts chose to describe in terms approaching to blasphemy , an apocryphal , as well as a delicate theme .<span corresp="#note40" type="note_anchor">[ 40 ]</span>He knew , that praise , to do honour to the giver and receiver , must either have a real foundation in desert , or at least what , by the skilful management of the poet , may be easily represented as such .</p>
   <p>Having discussed the melancholy part of his subject , the poet , according to the approved custom in such cases , finds cause for rejoicing in the succession of James , as he had mourned over the death of his predecessor . From his firmness of character , and supposed military talents , the poet prophesies a warlike and victorious reign : a sad instance how seldom the poetic and prophetic character , so often claimed , are united in the same individual ! for James , as is well known , far from conquering foreign kingdoms , did not draw the sword even to defend his own . But very different events were expected , and augured , by the shoal of versifiers , who now rushed forwards to gratulate his accession .<span corresp="#note41" type="note_anchor">[ 41 ]</span></p>
   <p>The pindaric measure , in which the “ Threnodia Augustalis ” is written , contains nothing pleasing to modern ears . The rhymes are occasionally so far disjoined , that , like a fashionable married couple , they have nothing of union but the name . The inequalities of the verse are also violent , and remind us of ascending a broken and unequal stair-case . But the age had been accustomed to this rythm , which , however improperly , was considered as a genuine imitation of the style of Pindar . It must also be owned , that wherever , for a little way , Dryden uses a more regular measure , he displays all his usual command of harmony . The thirteenth stanza , for example , is as happily distinguished by melody of rhyme , as we have already observed it is eminent in beauty of poetry .</p>
   <p>The Latin title of this poem , like that of the Religio Laici , savours somewhat of affectation ; and has been taxed by Johnson as not strictly classical , a more unpardonable fault .<span corresp="#note42" type="note_anchor">[ 42 ]</span></p>
   <p>My learned friend , Dr Adam , has favoured me with the following defence of Dryden 's phrase : “ With respect to the title which that great poet gives to his elegy on the death of Charles , making allowance for the taste of the times and the licence of poets in framing names , I see no just foundation for Johnson 's criticism on the epithet Augustalis . Threnodia is a word purely Greek , used by no Latin author ; and Augustalis denotes , ‘ in honour of Augustus ; ’ thus , ludi Augustales , games instituted in honour of Augustis , Tac . An . 1 , 15 and 54 ; so sacerdotes vel sodales Augustales , ib . and 2 , 83 . Hist . 2 , 95 . Now as Augustus was a name given to the succeeding emperors , I see no reason , why Augustalis may not be used to signify , ‘ in honour of any king . ’ Besides , the very word Augustus denotes , ‘ venerable , august , royal : ’ and therefore Threnodia Augustalis may properly be put for , ‘ An Elegy in honour of an august Prince . ”</p>
   <p>The full title declared the poem to be written “ by John Dryden , servant to his late majesty , and to the present king ; ” a style which our author did not generally assume , but which the occasion rendered peculiarly proper . The poem appears to have been popular , as it went through two editions in the course of 1685 .</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Charles II . enjoyed excellent health , and was particularly careful to preserve it by constant exercise . His danger , therefore , fell like a thunder-bolt on his people , whose hearts were gained by his easy manners and good humour , and who considered , that the worst apprehensions they had ever entertained during his reign , arose from the religion and disposition of his successor . The mingled passions of affection and fear produced a wonderful sensation on the nation . The people were so passionately concerned , that North says , and appeals to all who recollected the time for the truth of his averment , that it was rare to see a person walking the street with dry eyes .

   <p>If there is safety in the multitude of counsellors , Charles did not find it in the multitude of physicians . Nine were in attendance , all men of eminence ; the presence of the least of whom , Le Sage would have said , was fully adequate to account for the subsequent catastrophe . They were Sir Thomas Millington , Sir Thomas Witherby , Sir Charles Scarborough , Sir Edmund King , Doctors Berwick , Charlton , Lower , Short , and Le Fevre . They signed a declaration , that the king had died of an apoplexy .</p>
   <p>Note III .</p>
   <p>The joyful short-lived news soon spread around .— P . 65 .</p>
   <p>An article was published in the Gazette , on the third day of the king 's illness , importing , “ That his physicians now conceived him to be in a state of safety , and that in a few days he would be freed from his indisposition . "[ 61 ] North tells us , however , on the authority of his brother , the Lord Keeper , that the only hope which the physicians afforded to the council , was an assurance , ( joyfully communicated ,) that the king was ill of a violent fever . The council seeing little consolation in these tidings , one of the medical gentlemen explained , by saying , that they now knew what they had to do , which was to administer the cortex . This was done while life lasted ,<span corresp="#note62" type="note_anchor">[ 62 ]</span>although some of the physicians seem to have deemed the prescription improper ; in which case , Charles , after escaping the poniards and pistols of the Jesuits , may be said to have fallen a victim to their bark .</p>

     <l n="1">And he who most performed , and promised less ,</l>
     <l n="2">Even Short himself , forsook the unequal strife .— P . 67 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Dr Thomas Short , an eminent physician , who came into the court practice when Dr Richard Lower , who formerly enjoyed it , embraced the political principles of the Whig party . Short , a Roman Catholic , and himself a Tory , was particularly acceptable to the Tories . To this circumstance he probably owes the compliment paid him by our author , and another from Lord Mulgrave to the same purpose . Otway reckons , among his selected friends ,</p>
   <p>Short , beyond what numbers can commend .<span corresp="#note63" type="note_anchor">[ 63 ]</span></p>

   </lg>
   <p>Dr Short , as one of the king 's physicians , attended the death-bed of Charles , and subscribed the attestation , that he died of an apoplexy . Yet there has been ascribed to him an expression of dubious import , which caused much disquisition at the time ; namely , that “ the king had not fair play for his life . ” Burnet says plainly , that “ Short suspected poison , and talked more freely of it than any Protestant durst venture to do at the time . ” He , adds , that “ Short himself was taken suddenly ill , upon taking a large draught of wormwood wine , in the house of a Popish patient near the Tower ; and while on his death-bed , he told Lower , and Millington , and other physicians , that he believed he himself was poisoned , for having spoken too freely of the king 's death . "[ 64 ] Mulgrave states the same report in these words , which , coming from a professed Tory , are entitled to the greater credit : “ I am obliged to observe , that the most knowing and most deserving of all his physicians did not only believe him poisoned , but thought himself so too , not long after , for having declared his opinion a little too boldly . "[ 65 ] North , in confutation of this report , has interpreted Short 's expression , as meaning nothing more than that the king 's malady was mistaken by his physicians , who , by their improper prescriptions , deprived nature of fair play ;<span corresp="#note66" type="note_anchor">[ 66 ]</span>and he appeals to all the eminent physicians who attended Dr Short in his last illness , whether he did not fall a victim to his own bold method , in using the cortex . Upon the whole , whatever opinion this individual physician may have adopted through mistake , or affectation of singularity , and whatever credit faction , or indeed popular prejudice in general , may have given to such rumours at the time , there appears no solid reason to believe that Charles died of poison . Both Burnet and Mulgrave say , that they never heard a hint that his brother was accessary to such a crime ; and it is very unlikely that any zealous Catholic should have had either opportunity , or inclination , to hasten the reign of a prince of that religion , by the unsolicited service of poisoning his brother . The other physicians , several of whom , Lower , for example , were Whigs , as well as Protestants , gave no countenance to this rumour , which was circulated by a Catholic . And , as the symptoms of the king 's disorder are decidedly apoplectic , the report may be added to those with which history abounds , and which are raised and believed only because an extraordinary end is thought most fit for the eminent and powerful .</p>
   <p>Short , as we have incidentally noticed , survived his royal patient but a few months . He was succeeded in his practice by Ratcliffe , the famous Tory physician of Queen Anne 's reign .</p>

   <p>The historical accounts of the dying requests of Charles are contradictory and obscure . It seems certain , that he earnestly recommended his favourite mistress , the Duchess of Portsmouth , to the protection of his successor . He had always , he said , loved her , and he now loved her at the last . The Bishop of Bath presented to him his natural son , the Duke of Richmond ; whom he blessed , and recommended , with his other children , to his successor 's protection ; adding , “ Do not let poor Nelly<span corresp="#note67" type="note_anchor">[ 67 ]</span>starve . ” He seems to have said nothing of the Duke of Monmouth , once so much beloved , and whom , shortly before , he entertained thoughts of recalling from banishment , and replacing in favour ; perhaps he thought , any recommendation to James of a rival so hated would be ineffectual . Burnet says , he spoke not a word of the queen . Echard , on the contrary , affirms , that , at the exhortation of the Bishop of Bath , Charles sent for the queen , and asked and received her pardon for the injuries he had done her bed .<span corresp="#note68" type="note_anchor">[ 68 ]</span>In Fountainhall 's Manuscript , the queen is said to have sent a message , requesting his pardon if she had ever offended him : “ Alas , poor lady ! ” replied the dying monarch , “ she never offended me ; I have too often injured her . "[ 69 ] This account seems more probable than that of Echard ; for so public a circumstance , as a personal visit from the queen to her husband 's death-bed , could hardly have been disputed by contemporaries .</p>

    <head>THE</head>

    <head>A POEM .</head>
    <head>IN THREE PARTS .</head>

   </lg>
   <p>THE</p>
   <p>HIND AND THE PANTHER .</p>
   <p>In the Life of Dryden , there is an attempt to trace the progress and changes of those religious opinions , by which he was unfortunately conducted into the errors of Popery . With all the zeal of a now convert , he seems to have been impatient to invite others to follow his example , by detailing , in poetry , the arguments which had appeared to him unanswerable . “ The Hind and the Panther ” is the offspring of that rage for proselytism , which is a peculiar attribute of his new mother church . The author is anxious , in the preface , to represent this poem as a task which he had voluntarily undertaken , without receiving even the subject from any one . His assertion seems worthy of full credit ; for , although it was the most earnest desire of James II . to employ every possible mode for the conversion of his subjects , there is room to believe , that , if the poem had been written under his direction , the tone adopted by Dryden towards the sectaries would have been much more mild . It is a well-known point of history , that , in order to procure as many friends as possible to the repeal of the test act and penal laws against the Catholics , James extended indulgence to the puritans and sectarian non-conformists , the ancient enemies of his person , his family , and monarchical establishments in general . Dryden obviously was not in this court secret ; the purpose of which was to unite those congregations , whom he has described under the parable of bloody bears , boars , wolves , foxes , &amp; c. in a common interest with the Hind , against the exclusive privileges of the Panther and her subjects . His work was written with the precisely opposite intention of recommending an union between the Catholics and the church of England ; at least , of persuading the latter to throw down the barriers , by which the former were kept out of state employments . Such an union had at one time been deemed practicable ; and , in 1685 , pamphlets had been published , seriously exhorting the church of England to a league with the Catholics , in order to root out the sectaries as common enemies to both . The steady adherence of the church of England to Protestant principles , rendered all hopes of such an union abortive ; and , while Dryden was composing his poem upon this deserted plan , James was taking different steps to accomplish the main purpose both of the poet and monarch .</p>
   <p>The power of the crown to dispense , at pleasure , with the established laws of the kingdom , had been often asserted , and sometimes exercised , by former English monarchs . A king was entitled , the favourers of prerogative argued , to pardon the breach of a statute , when committed ; why not , therefore , to suspend its effect by a dispensation a priori , or by a general suspension of the law ? which was only doing in general , what he was confessedly empowered to do in particular cases . But a doctrine so pernicious to liberty was never allowed to take root in the constitution ; and the confounding the prerogative of extending mercy to individual criminals , with that of annulling the laws under which they had been condemned , was a fallacy easily detected and refuted . Charles II . twice attempted to assert his supposed privilege of suspending the penal laws , by granting a general toleration ; and he had , in both cases , been obliged to retract , by the remonstrances of Parliament .<span corresp="#note70" type="note_anchor">[ 70 ]</span>But his successor , who conceived that his power was situated on a more firm basis , and who was naturally obstinate in his resolutions , was not swayed by this recollection . He took every opportunity to exercise the power of dispensing with the laws , requiring Catholics to take the test agreeable to act of Parliament . He asserted his right to do so in his speech to the Parliament , on 9th November , 1685 ; he despised the remonstrances of both Houses , upon so flagrant and open a violation of the law ; and he endeavoured , by a packed bench , and a feigned action at law , to extort a judicial ratification of his dispensing power . At length , not contented with granting dispensations to individuals , the king resolved at once to suspend the operation of all penal statutes , which required conformity with the church of England , as well as of the test act .</p>
   <p>On the 4th of April , 1687 , came forth the memorable Declaration of Indulgence , in favour of all non-conformists of whatever persuasion ; by which they were not only protected in the full exercise of their various forms of religion , but might , without conformity , be admitted to all offices in the state . With what consequences this act of absolute power was attended , the history of the Revolution makes us fully acquainted ; for it is surely unnecessary to add , that the indulgence occasioned the petition and trial of the bishops , the most important incident in that momentous period .</p>
   <p>About a fortnight after the publishing of this declaration of indulgence , our author 's poem made its appearance ; being licensed on the 11th April , 1687 , and published a few days after . If it was undertaken without the knowledge of the court , it was calculated , on its appearance , to secure the royal countenance and approbation . Accordingly , as soon as it was published in England , a second edition was thrown off at a printing office in Holyroodhouse , Edinburgh , then maintained for the express purpose of disseminating such treatises as were best calculated to serve the Catholic cause .<span corresp="#note71" type="note_anchor">[ 71 ]</span>If the Protestant dissenters ever cast their eyes upon profane poetry , “ The Hind and the Panther ” must have appeared to them a perilous commentary on the king 's declaration ; since it shows clearly , that the Catholic interest alone was what the Catholic king and poet had at heart , and that , however the former might now find himself obliged to court their favour , to strengthen his party against the established church , the deep remembrance of ancient feuds and injuries was still cherished , and the desire of vengeance on the fanatics neither sated nor subdued .</p>
   <p>In composing this poem , it may be naturally presumed , that Dryden exerted his full powers . He was to justify , in the eyes of the world , a step which is always suspicious ; and , by placing before the public the arguments by which he had been induced to change his religion , he was at once to exculpate himself , and induce others to follow his example . He chose , for the mode of conveying this instruction , that parabolical form of writing , which took its rise perhaps in the East , or rather which , in a greater or less degree , is common to all nations . An old author observes , that there is “ no species of four-footed beasts , of birds , of fish , of insects , reptiles , or any other living things , whose nature is not found in man . How exactly agreeable to the fox are some men 's tempers ; whilst others are profest bears in human shape . Here you shall meet a crocodile , who seeks , with feigned tears , to entrap you to your ruin ; there a serpent creeps , and winds himself into your affections , till , on a sudden , when warmed with favours , he will bite and sting you to death . Tygers , lions , leopards , panthers , wolves , and all the monstrous generations of Africa , may be seen masquerading in the forms of men ; and ‘ tis not hard for an observing mind to see their natural complexions through the borrowed vizard . "[ 72 ] Dryden conceived the idea , of extending to religious communities the supposed resemblance between man and the lower animals . Under the name of a “ milk-white Hind , immortal and unchanged , ” he described the unity , simplicity , and innocence of the church , to which he had become a convert ; and under that of a Panther , fierce and inexorable towards those of a different persuasion , he bodied forth the church of England , obstinate in defending its pale from encroachment , by the penal statutes and the test act .<span corresp="#note73" type="note_anchor">[ 73 ]</span>There wanted not critics to tell him , that he had mistaken the character of either communion .<span corresp="#note74" type="note_anchor">[ 74 ]</span>The inferior sects are described under the emblem of various animals , fierce and disgusting in proportion to their more remote affinity to the church of Rome . And in a dialogue between the two principal characters , the leading arguments of the controversy between the churches , at least what the poet chose to consider as such , are formally discussed .</p>
   <p>But Dryden 's plan is far from coming within the limits of a fable or parable , strictly so called ; for it is strongly objected , that the poet has been unable to avoid confounding the real churches themselves with the Hind and the Panther , under which they are represented . “ The hind , ” as Johnson observes , “ at one time is afraid to drink at the common brook , because she may be worried ; but , walking home with the panther , talks by the way of the Nicene fathers , and at last declares herself to be the Catholic church . ” And the same critic complains , “ that the king is now Cæsar , and now the lion , and that the name Pan is given to the Supreme Being . ” “ The Hind and Panther transversed , or the City and Country Mouse , ” which was written in ridicule of this poem , turns chiefly upon the incongruity of the emblems adopted by Dryden , and the inconsistencies into which his plan had led him .<span corresp="#note75" type="note_anchor">[ 75 ]</span>This ridicule , and the criticism on which it is founded , seems , however , to be carried a little too far . If a fable , or parable , is to be entirely and exclusively limited to a detail which may suit the common actions and properties of the animals , or things introduced in it , we strike out from the class some which have always been held the most beautiful examples of that style of fiction . It is surely as easy to conceive a Hind and Panther discussing points of religion , as that the trees of the forest should assemble together to chuse a king , invite different trees to accept of that dignity , and , finally , make choice of a bramble . Yet no one ever hesitates to pronounce Jotham 's Parable of the Trees one of the finest which ever was written . Or what shall we say of one of the most common among Æsop 's apologues , which informs us in the outset , that the lion , the ox , the sheep , and the ass , went a hunting together , on condition of dividing equally whatever should be caught ? Yet this and many other fables , in which the animals introduced act altogether contrary to their nature , are permitted to rank without censure in the class which they assume . Nay , it may be questioned whether the most proper fables are not those in which the animals are introduced as acting upon the principles of mankind . For instance , if an author be compared to a daw , it is no fable , but a simile ; but if a tale be told of a daw who dressed himself in borrowed feathers , a thing naturally impossible , the simile becomes a proper fable . Perhaps , therefore , it is sufficient for the fabulist , if he can point out certain original and leading features of resemblance betwixt his emblems , and that which they are intended to represent , and he may be permitted to take considerable latitude in their farther approximation . It may be farther urged in Dryden 's behalf , that the older poets whom he professed to imitate , Spenser , for example , in “ Mother Hubbart 's Tale , ” which he has actually quoted , and Chaucer , in that of the “ Nun 's Priest 's tale ” have stepped beyond the simplicity of the ancient fable , and introduced a species of mixed composition , between that and downright satire . The names and characters of beasts are only assumed in “ Mother Hubbart 's Tale , ” that the satirist might , under that slight cloak , say with safety what he durst not otherwise have ventured upon ; and in the tale of Chaucer , the learned dialogue about dreams is only put into the mouths of a cock and hen , to render the ridicule of such disquisitions more poignant . Had Spenser been asked , why he described the court of the lion as exactly similar to that of a human prince , and introduced the fox as composing madrigals for the courtiers ? he would have bidden the querist ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">—— Yield his sense was all too blunt and base ,</l>
     <l n="2">That n'ote without a hound fine footing trace .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And if the question had been put to the bard of Woodstock , why , he made his cock an astrologer , and his hen a physician , he would have answered , that his satire might become more ludicrous , by putting these grave speeches into the mouths of such animals . Dryden seems to have proposed as his model this looser kind of parable ; giving his personages , indeed , the names of the Hind and Panther , but reserving to himself the privilege of making the supposed animals use the language and arguments of the communities they were intended to represent . I must own , however , that this licence appears less pardonable in the First Part , where he professes to use the majestic turn of heroic poetry , than in those which are dedicated to argument and satire .</p>
   <p>Dryden has , in this very poem , given us two examples of the more pure and correct species of fable . These , which he terms in the preface Episodes , are the tale of the Swallows seduced to defer their emigration , and that of the Pigeons , who chose a Buzzard for their king .<span corresp="#note78" type="note_anchor">[ 78 ]</span>It is remarkable , that , as the former is by much the most complete story , so , although put in the mouth of a representative of the heretical church , it proved eventually to contain a truth sorrowful to our author , and those of the Roman Catholic persuasion : For , while the Buzzard 's elevation ( Bishop Burnet by name ) was not attended with any peculiar evil consequences to the church of England , the short gleam of Popish prosperity was soon overcast , and the priests and their proselytes plunged in reality into all the distress of the swallows in the Panther 's fable .</p>
   <p>In conformity to our author 's plan , announced in the preface , the fable is divided into Three Parts . The First is dedicated to the general description and character of the religious sects , particularly the churches of Rome and of England . And here Dryden has used the more elevated strain of heroic poetry . In the Second , the general arguments of the controversy between the two churches are agitated , for which purpose a less magnificent style of language is adopted . In the Third and last Part , from discussing the disputed points of theology , the Hind and Panther descend to consider the particulars in which their temporal interests were judged at this period to interfere with each other . And here Dryden has lowered the tone of his verse to that of common conversation . We must admit , with Johnson , that these distinctions of style are not always accurately adhered to . The First Part has familiar lines ; as , for instance , the four with which it concludes :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Considering her a civil well-bred beast ,</l>
     <l n="2">And more a gentlewoman than the rest ,</l>
     <l n="3">After some common talk , what rumours ran ,</l>
     <l n="4">The lady of the spotted muff began .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Some passages are not only mean in expression , but border on</l>
     <l n="6">profaneness ; as ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="7">The smith divine , as with a careless beat ,</l>
     <l n="8">Struck out the mute creation at a heat ;</l>
     <l n="9">But when at last arrived to human race ,</l>
     <l n="10">The Godhead took a deep considering space .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>On the other hand , the Third Part has passages in a higher tone of poetry ; particularly the whole character of James in the fable of the Pigeons and the Buzzard : but it is enough to fulfil the author 's promise in the preface , that the parts do each in general preserve a peculiar character and style , though occasionally sliding into that of the others .</p>
   <p>It is a main defect of the plan just detailed , that it necessarily limited the interest of the poem to that crisis of politics when it was published . A work , which the author announces as calculated to attract the favour of friends , and to animate the malevolence of enemies , is now read with cold indifference . He launched forth into a tide of controversy , which , however furious at the time , has long subsided , leaving his poem a disregarded wreck , stranded upon the shores which the surges once occupied .</p>
   <p>Setting aside this original defect , the First and Last Parts of the poem , in particular , abound with passages of excellent poetry . In the former , it is worthy attention , with what ease and command of his language and subject Dryden passes from his sublime description of the immortal Hind , to brand and stigmatise the sectaries by whom she was hated and persecuted ; a rare union of dignity preserved in satire , and of satire engrafted upon heroic poetry . The reader cannot , at the same time , fail to observe the felicity with which the poet has assigned prototypes to the dissenting churches , agreeing in character with that which he meant to fix upon their several congregations . The Bear , unlicked to forms , is the emblem of the Independents , who disclaimed them ;<span corresp="#note79" type="note_anchor">[ 79 ]</span>the Wolf , which hunts in herds , to the classes and synods of the Presbyterian church ; the Hare , to the peaceful Quakers ; the wild Boar , to the fierce and savage Anabaptists , who ravaged Germany , the native country of that animal . With similar felicity , the “ bird , who warned St Peter of his fall , ” is , from that circumstance , and his nocturnal vigils , afterwards assigned as the representative of the Catholic clergy . Above all , the attention is arrested by the pointed description of those dark and sullen enthusiasts , who , scarcely agreeing among themselves upon any peculiar points of doctrine , rested their claim to superior sanctity upon abominating and contemning those usual forms of reverence , by which men , in all countries since the beginning of the world , have agreed to distinguish public worship from ordinary or temporal employments . The whole of this First Part of the poem abounds with excellent poetry , rising above the tone of ordinary satire , and yet possessing all its poignancy . The difference , to those against whom it is directed , is like that of being blasted by a thunder-bolt , instead of being branded with a red-hot iron .</p>
   <p>The First Part of “ The Hind and Panther , ” although chiefly dedicated to general characters , contains some reasoning on the grand controversy , similar to that which occupies the Second . The author displays , with the utmost art and energy of argumentative poetry , the reasons by which he was himself guided in adopting the Roman Catholic faith . He is led into this discussion , by mentioning the heretical doctrine of the Unitarians ; and insists , that the Protestant churches , which have consented to postpone human reason to faith , by acquiescing in the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity , are not entitled to appeal to the authority which they have waived , for arguments against the mystery of the real presence in the eucharist . This was a favourite mode of reasoning of the Catholics at the time , as may be seen from the numerous treatises which they sent forth upon the controversy . It is undoubtedly very fit to impose on the vulgar , but completely overshoots the mark at which it aims . For , if our yielding humble belief to one abstruse doctrine of divinity be sufficient to debar the exercise of our reason respecting another , it is obvious , that , by the same reason , the appeal to our understanding must be altogether laid aside in matters of doubtful orthodoxy . The Protestant divines , therefore , took a distinction ; and , while they admitted they were obliged to surrender their human judgment in matters of divine revelation which were above their reason , they asserted the power of appealing to its guidance in those things of a finite nature which depend on the evidence of sense , and the consequent privileges of rejecting any doctrine , which , being within the sphere of human comprehension , is nevertheless repugnant to the understanding : therefore , while they received the doctrine of the Trinity as an infinite mystery , far above their reason , they contended against that of transubstantiation as capable of being tried by human faculties , and as contradicted by an appeal to them . In a subsequent passage , the author taxes the church of England with an attempt to reconcile contradictions , by admitting the real presence in the eucharist , and yet denying actual transubstantiation . Dryden boldly appeals to the positive words of scripture , and sums his doctrine thus :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The literal sense is hard to flesh and blood ,</l>
     <l n="2">But nonsense never can be understood .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Granting , however , the obscurity or mystery of the one doctrine , it is a hard choice to be obliged to adopt , in its room , that which asserts an acknowledged impossibility .</p>
   <p>In the Second Part , another point of the controversy is agitated ; the infallibility , namely , which is claimed by the Roman church . The author appears here to have hampered himself in the toils of his own argument in a former poem . He had asserted in the “ Religio Laici , ” that the Scriptures contained all things necessary for salvation ; while he yet admitted , that those , whose bent inclined them to the study of polemical divinity , were to be guided by the expositions of the fathers , and the earlier , especially the written , traditions of the Church . There is , as has been noticed in the remarks on “ Religio Laici , ” a certain vacillation in our author 's arguments concerning tradition , while yet a Protestant , which prepares us for his finally reposing his doubts in the bosom of that church , which pretends to be the sole depositary of the earlier doctrines of Christianity , and claims a right to ascertain all doubts in point of faith , by the same mode , and with the same unerring certainty , as the original church in the days of the apostles and fathers . These doubts , with which Dryden seems to have been deeply impressed while within the pale of the Church of England , he now objects to her as inconsistencies , and accuses her of having recourse to tradition , or discarding it , as suited the argument which , for the time , she had in agitation . It is unnecessary here to trace the various grounds on which reformed churches prove , that the chain of apostolical tradition has been broken and shivered ; and that the church , claiming the proud title of Infallible , has repeatedly sanctioned heresy and error . Neither is it necessary to shew , how the Church of England stops short in her reception of traditions , adopting only those of the primitive church . Something on these points may be found in the notes . I may remark , that Dryden is of the Gallican or low Church of Rome , if I may so speak , and rests the infallibility which he claims for her in the Pope and Council of the Church , and not in the Vicar of Christ alone . In point of literary interest , this Second Part is certainly beneath the other two . It furnishes , however , an excellent specimen of poetical ratiocination upon a most unpromising subject .</p>
   <p>The Third Part refers entirely to the politics of the day ; and the poet has endeavoured , by a number of arguments , to remove the deep jealousy and apprehensions which the king 's religion , and his zeal for proselytism , had awakened in the Church of England . He does not even spare to allege a recent adoption of presbyterian doctrines , as the reason for her unwonted resistance to the royal will ; and all the vigour of his satire is pointed against the latitudinarian clergy , or , as they were finally called , the Low Church Party , who now began to assert , what James at length found a melancholy truth , that the doctrine of passive obedience and non-resistance was not peremptorily binding , when the church herself was endangered by the measures of the monarch . Stillingfleet , the personal antagonist of our author , in the controversy concerning the Duchess of York 's posthumous declaration of faith , is personally and ferociously attacked . The poem concludes with a fable delivered by each of the disputants , of which the moral applies to the project and hopes of her rival . We have already said , that which is told by the Panther , as it is most spirited and pointed , proved , to the great regret of the author , most strictly prophetic . It is remarkable for containing a beautiful character of King James , as the other exhibits a satirical portrait of the historian Burnet , with whom the court party in general , and Dryden personally , was then at enmity .</p>
   <p>The verse in which these doctrines , polemical and political , are delivered , is among the finest specimens of the English heroic stanza . The introductory verses , in particular , are lofty and dignified in the highest degree ; as are those , in which the splendour and majesty of the Church of Rome are set forth , in all the glowing colours of rich imagery and magnificent language . But the same praise extends to the versification of the whole poem . It never falls , never becomes rugged ; rises with the dignified strain of the poetry ; sinks into quaint familiarity , where sarcasm and humour are employed ; and winds through all the mazes of theological argument , without becoming either obscure or prosaic . The arguments are in general advanced with an air of conviction and candour , which , in those days , must have required the protestant reader to be on his guard in the perusal , and which seems completely to ascertain the sincerity of the author in his new religious creed .</p>
   <p>This controversial poem , containing a bold defiance to all who opposed the king 's measures or faith , had no sooner appeared , than our author became a more general object of attack than he had been even on the publication of “ Absalom and Achitophel . ” Indeed , his enemies were now far more numerous , including most of his former friends , the Tories of the high church , excepting a very few who remained attached to James , and saw , with anxiety , his destruction precipitated by the measures he was adopting .</p>
   <p>Montague and Prior were among the first to assail our author , in the parody , of which we have just given a large specimen . It must have been published before the 24th October 1687 , for it is referred to in “ The Laureat , ” another libel against Dryden , inscribed by Mr Luttrel with that date . This assault affected him the more , as coming from persons with whom he had lived on habits of civility . He is even said to have shed tears upon this occasion ; a report probably exaggerated , but which serves to shew , that he was sensible he had exposed himself to the most unexpected assailants , by the unpopularity of the cause which he had espoused . Some further particulars respecting this controversy are mentioned in Dryden 's Life . Another poet , or parodier , published “ The Revolter , a tragi-comedy , ” in which he brings the doctrines of the “ Religio Laici , ” and of the “ Hind and Panther , ” in battle array against each other , and rails at the author of both with the most unbounded scurrility .<span corresp="#note80" type="note_anchor">[ 80 ]</span></p>
   <p>Not only new enemies arose against him , but the hostility of former and deceased foes seemed to experience a sort of resurrection . Four Letters , by Matthew Clifford of the Charter-House , containing notes upon Dryden 's poems and plays , were now either published for the first time , or raked up from the obscurity of a dead-born edition , to fill up the cry of criticism against him on all sides . They are coarse and virulent to the last degree , and so far served the purpose of the publishers ; but , as they had no reference to “ The Hind and Panther , ” that defect was removed by a supplementary Letter from the facetious Tom Brown , an author , whose sole wish was to attain the reputation of a successful buffoon , and who , like the jesters of old , having once made himself thoroughly absurd and ridiculous , gained a sort of privilege to make others feel his grotesque raillery .<span corresp="#note81" type="note_anchor">[ 81 ]</span>Besides the reflections contained in this letter , Brown also published “ The New Converts exposed , or Reasons for Mr Bayes changing his Religion , ” in two parts ; the first of which appeared in 1688 , and the second in 1690 . From a passage in the preface to the first part , which may serve as a sample of Tom 's buffoonery , we learn , Dryden publicly complained , that , although he had put his name to “ The Hind and Panther , ” those who criticized or replied to that poem had not imitated his example .<span corresp="#note82" type="note_anchor">[ 82 ]</span></p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Another of these witty varlets published , in 1688 , “ Religio Laici , or a</l>
     <l n="2">Layman 's Faith , touching the Supreme Head and Infallible Guide of the</l>
     <l n="3">Church , in two letters , &amp; c. by J. R. a convert of Mr Bayes , ” licensed</l>
     <l n="4">June the 1st , 1688 . From this pamphlet we have given some extracts in</l>
     <l n="5">the introductory remarks to “ Religio Laici , ” pp . 9 , 10 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>There were , besides , many libels of the most personal kind poured forth against Dryden by the poets who supplied the usual demand of the hawkers . One of the most virulent contains a singular exhibition of rage and impotence . It professes to contain a review of our poet 's life and literary labours , and calls itself “ The Laureat . ” This , as containing some curious particulars , is given below .<span corresp="#note83" type="note_anchor">[ 83 ]</span></p>
   <p>The cry against our author being thus general , we may reasonably suppose , that he would have taken some opportunity to exercise his powers of retort upon those who were most active or most considerable among the aggressors , and that Montague and Prior stood a fair chance of being coupled up with Doeg and Og , his former antagonists . But , if Dryden entertained any intention of retaliation , the Revolution , which crushed his rising prospects , took away both the opportunity and inclination . From that period , the fame of “ The Hind and Panther ” gradually diminished , as the controversy between Protestant and Papist gave way to that between Whig and Tory . Within a few years after the first publication of the poem , Swift ranks it among the compositions of Grubstreet ; ironically terms it , “ the master-piece of a famous author , now living , intended as a complete abstract of sixteen thousand schoolmen , from Scotus to Bellarmine ; ” and immediately subjoins , “ Tommy Potts , supposed by the same hand , by way of Supplement to the former . "[ 84 ] With such acrimony do men of genius treat the productions of each other ; and so certain it is , that , to enjoy permanent reputation , an author must chuse a theme of permanent interest .</p>

   <note xml:id="note74" place="bottom" n="74">“ Only by the way , before we bring D. against D. to the stake , I would fain know how Mr Bayes , that so well understood the nature of beasts , came to pitch upon the Hind and the Panther , to signify the church of Rome and the church of England ? Doubtless his reply will be , because the hind is a creature harmless and innocent ; the panther mischievous and inexorable . Let all this be granted ; what is this to the author 's absurdity in the choice of his beasts ? For the scene of the persecution is Europe , a part of the world which never bred panthers since the creation of the universe . On the other side , grant his allusion passable , and then he stigmatizes the church of England to be the most cruel and most voracious creature that ranges all the Lybian deserts ;— a character , which shows him to have a strange mist before his eyes when he reads ecclesiastical history .

   <p>Which is another blunder , cujus contrarium verum est : For if beauty , strength , and courage , advance the value of the several parts of the creation , without question the panther is far to be preferred before the hind , a poor , silly , timorous , ill-shaped , bobtailed creature , of which a score will hardly purchase the skin of a true panther . Had he looked a little farther , Ludolphus would have furnished him with a zebra , the most beautiful of all the four-footed creatures in the world , to have coped with his panther for spots , and with his hind for gentleness and mildness ; of which one was sold singly to the Turkish governor of Suaquena for 2000 Venetian ducats . There had been a beast for him , as pat as a pudding for a friar 's mouth . But to couple the hind and the panther was just like sic magna parvis componere ; and , therefore , he had better have put his hind in a good pasty , or reserved her for some more proper allusion ; for this , though his nimble beast have four feet , will by no means run quatuor pedibus , though she had a whole kennel of hounds at her heels . ” — The Revolter , a Tragi-comedy . ]</p>
   <note xml:id="note75" place="bottom" n="75">The following justification of their plan is taken from the preface , which is believed to have been entirely the composition of Montague .</note>
   <p>“ The favourers of ‘ The Hind and Panther ’ will be apt to say in its defence , that the best things are capable of being turned to ridicule ; that Homer has been burlesqued , and Virgil travestied , without suffering any thing in their reputation from that buffoonery ; and that , in like manner ,' The Hind and the Panther ’ may be an exact poem , though it is the subject of our raillery : But there is this difference , that those authors are wrested from their true sense , and this naturally falls into ridicule ; there is nothing represented here as monstrous and unnatural , which is not equally so in the original .— First , as to the general design ; Is it not as easy to imagine two mice bilking coachmen , and supping at the Devil , as to suppose a hind entertaining the panther at a hermit 's cell , discussing the greatest mysteries of religion , and telling you her son Rodriguez writ very good Spanish ? What can be more improbable and contradictory to the rules and examples of all fables , and to the very design and use of them ? They were first begun , and raised to the highest perfection , in the eastern countries , where they wrote in signs , and spoke in parables , and delivered the most useful precepts in delightful stories ; which , for their aptness , were entertaining to the most judicious , and led the vulgar into understanding by surprizing them with their novelty , and fixing their attention . All their fables carry a double meaning ; the story is one and entire ; the characters the same throughout , not broken or changed , and always conformable to the nature of the creatures they introduce . They never tell you , that the dog , which snapt at a shadow , lost his troop of horse ; that would be unintelligible ; a piece of flesh is proper for him to drop , and the reader will apply it to mankind : They would not say , that the daw , who was so proud of her borrowed plumes , looked very ridiculous , when Rodriguez came and took away all the book but the 17th , 24th , and 25th chapters , which she stole from him . But this is his new way of telling a story , and confounding the moral and the fable together .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Before the word was written , said the hind ,</l>
     <l n="2">Our Saviour preached the faith to all mankind .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>What relation has the hind to our Saviour ? or what notion have we of a panther 's bible ? If you say he means the church , how does the church feed on lawns , or range in the forest ? Let it be always a church , or always the cloven-footed beast , for we cannot bear his shifting the scene every line . If it is absurd in comedies to make a peasant talk in the strain of a hero , or a country wench use the language of the court , how monstrous is it to make a priest of a hind , and a parson of a panther ? To bring them in disputing with all the formalities and terms of the school ? Though as to the arguments themselves , those we confess are suited to the capacity of the beasts ; and if we would suppose a hind expressing herself about these matters , she would talk at that rate . ”</p>
   <p>The reader may be curious to see a specimen of the manner in which these two applauded wits encountered Dryden 's controversial poem , with such eminent success , that a contemporary author has said , “ that ‘ The City and Country Mouse ’ ruined the reputation of the divine , as the ‘ Rehearsal ’ ruined the reputation of the poet . "[ 76 ] The plan is a dialogue between Bayes , and Smith , and Johnson , his old friends in the “ Rehearsal ; ” the poet recites to them a new work , in which the Popish and English churches are represented as the city and country mouse , the former spotted , the latter milk-white . The following is a specimen both of the poetry and dialogue :</p>

   <note xml:id="note80" place="bottom" n="80">“ In short , the whole poem , if it may deserve that name , is a piece of deformed , arrogant nonsense , and self-contradiction , drest up in fine language , like an ugly brazen-faced whore , peeping through the costly trappings of a point de Venise cornet . I call it nonsense , because unseasonable ; and arrogant , because impertinent : For could Mr Bayes have so little wit , to think himself a sufficient champion to decide the high mysteries of faith and transubstantiation , and the nice disputes concerning traditions and infallibility , in a discourse between “ The Hind and the Panther , ” which , undetermined hitherto , have exercised all the learning in the world ? Or , could he think the grand arcana of divinity a subject fit to be handled in flourishing rhyme , by the author of “ The Duke of Guise , ” or “ The Conquest of Peru , ” or “ The Spanish Friar : ” Doubts which Mr Bayes is no more able to unfold , than Saffold to resolve a question in astrology . And all this only as a tale to usher in his beloved character , and to shew the excellency of his wit in abusing honest men . If these were his thoughts , as we cannot rationally otherwise believe , seeing that no man of understanding will undertake an enterprise , wherein he does not think himself to have some advantage of his predecessors ; then does this romance , I say , of The Panther and the Hind , fall under the most fatal censure of unseasonable folly and saucy impertinence . Nor can I think , that the more solid , prudent , and learned persons of the Roman Church , con him any thanks for laying the prophane fingers of a turn-coat upon the altar of their sacred debates . ” — The Revolter , a tragi-comedy , acted between The Hind and Panther and Religio Laici , &amp; c. 1687 .</note>
   <note xml:id="note81" place="bottom" n="81">The following is the commencement of his “ Reflections on the Hind and Panther , ” in a letter to a friend , 1687 :</note>
   <p>“ The present you have made me of “ The Hind and Panther , ” is variously talked of here in the country . Some wonder what kind of champion the Roman Catholics have now gotten ; for they have had divers ways of representing themselves ; but this of rhyming us to death , is altogether new and unheard of , before Mr Bayes set about it ; and , indeed , he hath done it in the sparkishest poem that ever was seen . ‘ Tis true , he hath written a great many things ; but he never had such pure swiftness of thought , as in this composition , nor such fiery flights of fancy . Such hath always been his dramatical and scenical way of scribbling , that there was no post nor pillar in the town exempt from the pasting up of the titles of his plays ; insomuch , that the footboys , for want of skill in reading , do now ( as we hear ) often bring away , by mistake , the title of a new book against the Church of England , instead of taking down the play for the afternoon . Yet , if he did it well or handsomely , he might deserve some pardon ; but , alas ! how ridiculously doth he appear in print for any religion , who hath made it his business to laugh at all ! How can he stand up for any mode of worship , who hath been accustomed to bite , and spit his venom against the very name thereof ?</p>
   <p>“ Wherefore , I cannot but wish our adversaries joy on their new-converted hero , Mr Bayes ; whose principle it is to fight single with whole armies ; and this one quality he prefers before all the moral virtues put together . The Roman Catholics may talk what they will , of their Bellarmine and Perrone , their Hector and Achilles , and I know not who ; but I desire them all , to shew one such champion for the cause , as this Drawcansir : For he is the man that kills whole nations at once ; who , as he never wrote any thing , that any one can imagine has ever been the practice of the world , so , in his late endeavours to pen controversy , you shall hardly find one word to the purpose . He is that accomplished person , who loves reasoning so much in verse , and hath got a knack of writing it smoothly . The subject ( he treats of in this poem ) did , in his opinion , require more than ordinary spirit and flame ; therefore , he supposed it to be too great for prose ; for he is too proud to creep servilely after sense ; so that , in his verse , he soars high above the reach of it . To do this , there is no need of brain , ‘ tis but scanning right ; the labour is in the finger , not in the head .</p>
   <p>“ However , if Mr Bayes would be pleased to abate a little of the exuberancy of his fancy and wit ; to dispense with his ornaments and superfluencies of invention and satire , a man might consider , whether he should submit to his argument ; but take away the railing , and no argument remains ; so that one may beat the bush a whole day , and , after so much labour , only spring a butterfly , or start a hedge-hog .</p>
   <p>“ For all this , is it not great pity to see a man , in the flower of his romantic conceptions , in the full vigour of his studies on love and honour , to fall into such a distraction , as to walk through the thorns and briars of controversy , unless his confessor hath commanded it , as a penance for some past sins ? that a man , who hath read Don Quixote for the greatest part of his life , should pretend to interpret the Bible , or trace the footsteps of tradition , even in the darkest ages ? ” — Four Letters , &amp; c .]</p>
   <note xml:id="note82" place="bottom" n="82">“ To draw now to an end , Mr Bayes , I hear , has lately complained , at Willis ’ Coffeehouse , of the ill usage he has met in the world ; that whereas he had the generosity and assurance to set his own name to his late piece of polemic poetry , yet others , who have pretended to answer him , wanted the breeding and civility to do the like : Now , because I would not willingly disoblige a person of Mr Bayes 's character , I do here fairly , and before all the world , assure him that my name is Dudly Tomkinson , and that I live within two miles of St Michael 's Mount , in Cornwall , and have , in my time , been both constable , church-warden , and overseer of the parish ; by the same token , that the little gallery next the belfry , the new motto about the pulpit , the king 's arms , the ten commandments , and the great sun-dial in the church-yard , will transmit my name to all posterity . Furthermore , ( if it will do him any good at all ) I can make a pretty shift to read without spectacles ; wear my own hair , which is somewhat inclining to red ; have a large mole on my left cheek ; am mightily troubled with corns ; and , what is peculiar to my constitution , after half-a-dozen bottles of claret , which I generally carry home every night from the tavern , I never fail of a stool or two next morning ; besides , use to smoke a pipe every day after dinner , and afterwards steal a nap for an hour or two in the old wicker-chair near the oven ; take gentle purgatives spring and fall ; and it has been my custom , any time these sixteen years , ( as all the parish can testify ) to ride in Gambadoes . Nay , to win the heart of him for ever , I invite him here , before the courteous reader , to a country regale , ( provided he will before hand promise not to debauch my wife ,) where he shall have sugar to his roast beef , and vinegar to his butter ; and lastly , to make him amends for the tediousness of the journey , a parcel of relics to carry home with him , which I believe can scarce be matched in the whole Christian world ; but , because I have no great fancy that way , I do n't care if I part with them to so worthy a person ; they are as followeth :</note>

   <p>THE</p>
   <p>PREFACE .</p>
   <p>The nation is in too high a ferment , for me to expect either fair war , or even so much as fair quarter , from a reader of the opposite party . All men are engaged either on this side or that ; and though conscience is the common word which is given by both , yet if a writer fall among enemies , and cannot give the marks of their conscience , he is knocked down before the reasons of his own are heard . A preface , therefore , which is but a bespeaking of favour , is altogether useless . What I desire the reader should know concerning me , he will find in the body of the poem , if he have but the patience to peruse it . Only this advertisement let him take before-hand , which relates to the merits of the cause .</p>
   <p>No general characters of parties ( call them either sects or churches ) can be so fully and exactly drawn , as to comprehend all the several members of them ; at least all such as are received under that denomination . For example ; there are some of the church by law established , who envy not liberty of conscience to dissenters ; as being well satisfied that , according to their own principles , they ought not to persecute them . Yet these , by reason of their fewness , I could not distinguish from the numbers of the rest , with whom they are embodied in one common name . On the other side , there are many of our sects , and more indeed than I could reasonably have hoped , who have withdrawn themselves from the communion of the Panther , and embraced this gracious indulgence of his majesty in point of toleration . But neither to the one nor the other of these is this satire any way intended : it is aimed only at the refractory and disobedient on either side . For those , who are come over to the royal party , are consequently supposed to be out of gun-shot .<span corresp="#note85" type="note_anchor">[ 85 ]</span>Our physicians have observed , that , in process of time , some diseases have abated of their virulence , and have in a manner worn out their malignity , so as to be no longer mortal ; and why may not I suppose the same concerning some of those , who have formerly been enemies to kingly government , as well as Catholic religion ? I hope they have now another notion of both , as having found , by comfortable experience , that the doctrine of persecution is far from being an article of our faith .<span corresp="#note86" type="note_anchor">[ 86 ]</span></p>
   <p>It is not for any private man to censure the proceedings of a foreign prince :[ 87 ] but , without suspicion of flattery , I may praise our own , who has taken contrary measures , and those more suitable to the spirit of Christianity . Some of the dissenters , in their addresses to his majesty , have said , “ That he has restored God to his empire over conscience . "[ 88 ] I confess , I dare not stretch the figure to so great a boldness : but I may safely say , that conscience is the royalty and prerogative of every private man . He is absolute in his own breast , and accountable to no earthly power for that which passes only betwixt God and him . Those who are driven into the fold are , generally speaking , rather made hypocrites than converts .</p>
   <p>This indulgence being granted to all the sects , it ought in reason to be expected , that they should both receive it , and receive it thankfully . For , at this time of day , to refuse the benefit , and adhere to those whom they have esteemed their persecutors , what is it else but publicly to own , that they suffered not before for conscience-sake , but only out of pride and obstinacy , to separate from a church for those impositions , which they now judge may be lawfully obeyed ? After they have so long contended for their classical ordination ( not to speak of rites and ceremonies ) will they at length submit to an episcopal ? If they can go so far , out of complaisance to their old enemies , methinks a little reason should persuade them to take another step , and see whither that will lead them .<span corresp="#note89" type="note_anchor">[ 89 ]</span></p>
   <p>Of the receiving this toleration thankfully , I shall say no more , than that they ought , and I doubt not they will consider from what hand they received it . It is not from a Cyrus , a heathen prince , and a foreigner ,<span corresp="#note90" type="note_anchor">[ 90 ]</span>but from a christian king , their native sovereign ; who expects a return in specie from them , that the kindness , which he has graciously shewn them , may be retaliated on those of his own persuasion .</p>
   <p>As for the poem in general , I will only thus far satisfy the reader , that it was neither imposed on me , nor so much as the subject given me by any man . It was written during the last winter , and the beginning of this spring ; though with long interruptions of ill health and other hindrances . About a fortnight before I had finished it , his majesty 's Declaration for liberty of conscience came abroad ; which , if I had so soon expected , I might have spared myself the labour of writing many things which are contained in the third part of it . But I was always in some hope , that the church of England might have been persuaded to have taken off the penal laws and the test , which was one design of the poem , when I proposed to myself the writing of it .</p>
   <p>It is evident that some part of it was only occasional , and not first intended : I mean that defence of myself , to which every honest man is bound , when he is injuriously attacked in print ; and I refer myself to the judgment of those , who have read the answer to the Defence of the late king 's Papers , and that of the duchess , ( in which last I was concerned ) how charitably I have been represented there .<span corresp="#note91" type="note_anchor">[ 91 ]</span>I am now informed both of the author and supervisors of this pamphlet , and will reply , when I think he can affront me : for I am of Socrates 's opinion , that all creatures cannot . In the mean time let him consider whether he deserved not a more severe reprehension than I gave him formerly , for using so little respect to the memory of those , whom he pretended to answer ; and , at his leisure , look out for some original treatise of humility , written by any Protestant in English ; ( I believe I may say in any other tongue :) for the magnified piece of Duncombe on that subject , which either he must mean , or none , and with which another of his fellows has upbraided me , was translated from the Spanish of Rodriguez ; though with the omission of the seventeenth , the twenty-fourth , the twenty-fifth , and the last chapter , which will be found in comparing of the books .<span corresp="#note92" type="note_anchor">[ 92 ]</span></p>
   <p>He would have insinuated to the world , that her late Highness died not a Roman Catholic . He declares himself to be now satisfied to the contrary , in which he has given up the cause : for matter of fact was the principal debate betwixt us . In the mean time , he would dispute the motives of her change ; how preposterously , let all men judge , when he seemed to deny the subject of the controversy , the change itself .<span corresp="#note93" type="note_anchor">[ 93 ]</span>And because I would not take up this ridiculous challenge , he tells the world I cannot argue : but he may as well infer , that a Catholic cannot fast , because he will not take up the cudgels against Mrs James ,<span corresp="#note94" type="note_anchor">[ 94 ]</span>to confute the Protestant religion .</p>
   <p>I have but one word more to say concerning the poem as such , and abstracting from the matters , either religious or civil , which are handled in it . The First Part , consisting most in general characters and narration , I have endeavoured to raise , and give it the majestic turn of heroic poesy . The Second , being matter of dispute , and chiefly concerning church authority , I was obliged to make as plain and perspicuous as possibly I could ; yet not wholly neglecting the numbers , though I had not frequent occasions for the magnificence of verse . The Third , which has more of the nature of domestic conversation , is , or ought to be , more free and familiar than the two former .</p>
   <p>There are in it two episodes , or fables , which are interwoven with the main design ; so that they are properly parts of it , though they are also distinct stories of themselves . In both of these I have made use of the common-places of satire , whether true or false , which are urged by the members of the one church against the other : at which I hope no reader of either party will be scandalized , because they are not of my invention , but as old , to my knowledge , as the times of Boccace and Chaucer on the one side , and as those of the Reformation on the other .</p>
   <p>FOOTNOTES :</p>
   <note xml:id="note85" place="bottom" n="85">The tumultuary joy of the sectaries , upon their first view of this triumph over the church of England , led them into all the extravagancies of loyalty , which used to be practised by their ancient enemies the Tories . Addresses teeming with affection , and foaming with bombast , were poured in upon King James from all corners of his dominions ; Presbyterians , Anabaptists , Quakers , Sectaries of all sorts and persuasions , strove to be foremost in the race of gratitude . And when similar addresses came in from corporations , who had been formerly anxious to shew their loyalty on the subject of the Rye-house plot , the king 's accession , and other occasions of triumph to the Tories , the tone of these bodies also was wonderfully changed ; and , instead of raving against excluders , rebels , regicides , republicans , and fanatics , whose hellish contrivances endeavoured to destroy the safety of the kingdom , and the life of the king , these same gentlemen mention the Sectaries as their brethren and fellow-subjects , to whom the king , their common father , had been justly , liberally , royally pleased to grant freedom of conscience , for which the addressers offer their hearty and unfeigned thanks . These were the two classes of persons , whom Dryden , as they had closed with the measures of government , declares to be exempted from his satire . Those , therefore , against whom it is avowedly directed , are first , the Church of England , whose adherents saw her destruction aimed at through the pretence of toleration . 2dly , Those Sectaries , who distrusted the boon which the king presented , and feared that the consequences of this immediate indulgence at the hands of an ancient enemy , would be purchased by future persecution . These formed a body , small at first , but whose numbers daily increased .</note>
   <p>Among the numerous addresses which were presented to the court on this occasion , there are two somewhat remarkable from the quality and condition of the persons in whose name they are offered . The one is from the persons engaged in the schemes of Shaftesbury and Monmouth , and who set out by acknowledging their lives and fortunes forfeited to King James ; a singular instance of convicts offering their sentiments upon state affairs . The other is from no less a corporation than the company of London Cooks , which respectable persons declare their approbation of the indulgence , upon a principle recognized in their profession , “ the difference of men 's gusto , in religion , as in eatables ; ” and assure his majesty , that his declaration “ somewhat resembles the Almighty 's manna , which suited every man 's palate . ” History of Addresses , pp . 106 , 132 . ]</p>
   <note xml:id="note86" place="bottom" n="86">Most readers will , I think , acknowledge with me , the extreme awkwardness with which Dryden apologizes , for hoping well of those Sectaries , against whom he had so often discharged the utmost severity of his pen . Yet there is much real truth in the observation , though the compliment to the new allies of the Catholics is but a cold one . Many sects have distinguished themselves by faction , fanaticism , and furious excess at their rise , which , when their spirits have ceased to be agitated by novelty , and exasperated by persecution , have subsided into quiet orderly classes of citizens , only remarkable for some peculiarities of speculative doctrine .</note>

   <note xml:id="note91" place="bottom" n="91">In his ardour for extending the Catholic religion , James II . had directed copies of the papers found in his brother 's strongbox in favour of that communion , with the copy of a paper by his first duchess , giving the reasons for her conversion to that faith , to be printed , and circulated through the kingdom . These papers were answered by the learned Stillingfleet , then Dean of St Paul 's . A Defence of the Papers was published “ by command , ” of which it appears , from the passage in the text , that our author wrote the third part , which applies to the Duchess of York 's paper . Stillingfleet published a vindication of his answer , in which he attacks our author with some severity . A full account of the controversy will be found attached to Dryden 's part of the Defence , among his prose works .</note>
   <note xml:id="note92" place="bottom" n="92">In the controversy between Dryden and Stillingfleet , the former had concluded his Defence of the Duchess of York 's paper , by alleging , that “ among all the volumes of divinity written by the Protestants , there is not one original treatise , at least that I have seen or heard of , which has handled distinctly , and by itself , the Christian virtue of humility . ” This Stillingfleet , in his reply , calls a “ bare-faced assertion of a thing known to be false ; ” for , “ with-in a few years , besides what has been printed formerly , such a book hath been published in London . ” Dryden , in the text , replies to this allegation , that Duncombe 's treatise , which he supposes to be meant , is a translation from the Spanish of Rodriguez , therefore , not originally a Protestant work . Montague , in the preface to “ The Hind and Panther Transversed ” alleges , that Dryden has mistaken the name of the author of the treatise alluded to ; which was not , he asserts , Duncombe , but Allen . See the matter more fully canvassed in a note on the original passage , in “ The Duchess of York 's Paper Defended . ”</note>
   <note xml:id="note93" place="bottom" n="93">Dryden is not quite candid in his statement . In Stillingfleet 's answer to the Duchess 's paper , it is indeed called , the “ paper said to be written by a great lady ; ” but there is not another word upon the authority , which , indeed , considering it was published under the king 's immediate inspection , could not be very decorously disputed . Dryden seizes upon this phrase in his defence , and , coupling with it some expressions of the Bishop of Winchester , he argues that it was the intention of these sons of the church of England , to give the lie to their sovereign . In this vindication of the answer , Stillingfleet thus expresses himself : “ As to the main design of the third paper , I declared , that I considered it , as it was supposed to contain the reasons and motives of the conversion of so great a lady to the church of Rome .</note>
   <p>“ But this gentleman has now eased me of the necessity of farther considering it on that account . For he declares , that none of those motives or reasons are to be found in the paper of her highness . Which he repeats several times . ‘ She writ this paper , not as to the reasons she had herself for changing , &amp; c . ’ ‘ As for her reasons , they were only betwixt God and her own soul , and the priest with whom she spoke at last . ’</p>
   <p>“ And so my work is at an end as to her paper . For I never intended to ransack the private papers or secret narratives of great persons ; and I do not in the least question the relation now given from so great authority , as that he mentions of the passages concerning her ; and therefore I have nothing more to say as to what relates to the person of the duchess . ”</p>
   <p>It is obvious that Dryden , probably finding the divine too hard for him on the controversial part of the subject , affects to consider the dispute as entirely limited to the authenticity of the paper , which it cannot be supposed Stillingfleet ever seriously intended to impeach . ]</p>

This female theologian is mentioned in the “ Remarks from the country , upon the two Letters , relating to the convocation , and alterations in the liturgy . ” “ It is a thousand pities , so instructive and so eloquent papers should ever fall under such an imputation , ( of being too forward , and solemn impertinence ,) and be ranked among the scribblings of Eleanor James , with this only advantage of having better language , whereas the woman counsellor is judged to have the better meaning . ” Although Mrs James 's lucubrations were thus vilipended by the male disputants , one of her own sex thought it necessary to enter the lists in opposition to her .

     </lg>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The critics fastened on this line with great exultation , concluding , that doomed and fated mean precisely the same thing . “ Faith , Mr Bayes , ” says one of these gentlemen , “ if you were doomed to be hanged , whatever you were fated to ‘ twould give you but small comfort . "[ 134 ] This criticism is quite erroneous ; doom , in its general acceptation , meaning merely a sentence of any kind , the pronouncing which by no means necessarily implies its execution . In the criminal courts of Scotland , the sentence is always concluded with this formula , “ and this I pronounce for doom . ” Till of late years , a special officer recited the sentence after the judge , and was thence called the doomster ,<span corresp="#note135" type="note_anchor">[ 135 ]</span>an office now performed by the clerk of court . The criticism is founded on the word doom having been often , and even generally , used as synonimous to the sentence of heaven , and therefore inevitable . But in the text , it is obvious that the doom , or sentence , of an earthly tribunal is placed in opposition to the decree of Providence .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>The sect of Independents arose to great eminence in the civil wars , when the enthusiastic spirits were deemed entitled to preferment upon earth , in proportion to the extravagance of their religious zeal . Hume has admirably described their leading tenets , or rather the scorn with which they discarded the principles of other religious sects ; for their peculiarities consisted much more in their neglect and contempt of all forms , than in any rules or dogmata of their own .</p>
   <p>“ The Independents rejected all ecclesiastical establishments , and would admit of no spiritual courts , no government among pastors , no interposition of the magistrate in religious concerns , no fixed encouragement annexed to any system of doctrines or opinions . According to their principles , each congregation , united voluntarily and by spiritual ties , composed , within itself , a separate church , and exercised a jurisdiction , but one destitute of temporal sanctions , over its own pastor and its own members . The election alone of the congregation was sufficient to bestow the sacerdotal character ; and , as all essential distinction was denied between the laity and the clergy , no ceremony , no institution , no vocation , no imposition of hands , was , as in all other churches , supposed requisite to convey a right to holy orders . The enthusiasm of the Presbyterians led them to reject the authority of prelates , to throw off the restraint of liturgies , to retrench ceremonies , to limit the riches and authority of the priestly office . The fanaticism of the Independents , exalted to a higher pitch , abolished ecclesiastical government , disdained creeds and systems , neglected every ceremony , and confounded all ranks and orders . The soldier , the merchant , the mechanic , indulging the fervours of zeal , and guided by the illapses of the spirit , resigned himself to an inward and superior direction , and was consecrated , in a manner , by an immediate intercourse and communication with heaven . ”</p>
   <p>Butler thus describes the Independents :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The Independents , whose first station</l>
     <l n="2">Was in the rear of reformation :</l>
     <l n="3">A mongrel kind of church dragoons ,</l>
     <l n="4">That served for horse and foot at once ,</l>
     <l n="5">And in the saddle of one steed ,</l>
     <l n="6">The Saracen and Christian rid ,</l>
     <l n="7">Were free of every spiritual order ,</l>
     <l n="8">To preach , and fight , and pray , and murder .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It is well known , that these sectaries obtained the final ascendancy in the civil wars . Cromwell , their chief , was highly gifted as a preacher as well as a warrior ; witness his “ learned , devout , and conscientious exercise , held at Sir Peter Temple 's , in Lincoln 's Inn Fields , upon Romans xiii . 1 . ”</p>

     <l n="1">Among the timorous kind , the quaking Hare</l>
     <l n="2">Professed neutrality , but would not swear .— P . 120 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>As Mr Hume 's account of the rise of this sect ( the quakers ) is uncommonly lively , I take the liberty to insert it at length ; though , perhaps , the passage does not call for so prolonged a quotation . After describing the ascetic solitude of George Fox , their founder , he proceeds :</p>
   <p>“ When he had been sufficiently consecrated , in his own imagination , he felt that the fumes of self-applause soon dissipate , if not continually supplied by the admiration of others ; and he began to seek proselytes . Proselytes were easily gained , at a time when all men 's affections were turned towards religion , and when extravagant modes of it were sure to be most popular . All the forms of ceremony , invented by pride and ostentation , Fox and his disciples , from a superior pride and ostentation , carefully rejected : Even the ordinary rites of civility were shunned , as the nourishment of carnal vanity and self-conceit . They would bestow no titles of distinction : The name of friend was the only salutation with which they indiscriminately accosted every one . To no person would they make a bow , or move their hat , or give any signs of reverence . Instead of that affected adulation introduced into modern tongues , of speaking to individuals as if they were a multitude , they returned to the simplicity of ancient languages ; and thou and thee were the only expressions which , on any consideration , they would be brought to employ .</p>
   <p>“ Dress too , a material circumstance , distinguished the members of this sect . Every superfluity and ornament was carefully retrenched : No plaits to their coat , no buttons to their sleeves : No lace , no ruffles , no embroidery . Even a button to the hat , though sometimes useful , yet not being always so , was universally rejected by them with horror and detestation .</p>
   <p>“ The violent enthusiasm of this sect , like all high passions , being too strong for the weak nerves to sustain , threw the preachers into convulsions , and shakings , and distortions in their limbs ; and they thence received the appellation of Quakers . Amidst the great toleration which was then granted to all sects , and even encouragement given to all innovations , this sect alone suffered persecution . From the fervour of their zeal , the quakers broke into churches , disturbed public worship , and harrassed the minister and audience with railing and reproaches . When carried before a magistrate , they refused him all reverence , and treated him with the same familiarity as if he had been their equal . Sometimes they were thrown into mad-houses , sometimes into prisons : Sometimes whipped , sometimes pilloried . The patience and fortitude with which they suffered , begat compassion , admiration , esteem . A supernatural spirit was believed to support them under those sufferings , which the ordinary state of humanity , freed from the illusions of passion , is unable to sustain .</p>
   <p>“ The quakers creep 'd into the army : But , as they preached universal peace , they seduced the military zealots from their profession , and would soon , had they been suffered , have put an end , without any defeat or calamity , to the dominion of the saints . These attempts became a fresh ground for persecution , and a new reason for their progress among the people .</p>
   <p>“ Morals , with this sect , were carried , or affected to be carried , to the same degree of extravagance as religion . Give a quaker a blow on one cheek , he held up the other : Ask his cloke , he gave you his coat also . The greatest interest could not engage him in any court of judicature , to swear even to the truth . He never asked more for his wares than the precise sum which he was determined to accept . This last maxim is laudable , and continues still to be religiously observed by that sect .</p>
   <p>“ No fanatics ever carried farther the hatred to ceremonies , forms , orders , rites , and positive institutions . Even baptism and the Lord 's supper , by all other sects believed to be interwoven with the very vitals of Christianity , were disdainfully rejected by them . The very Sabbath they profaned . The holiness of churches they derided ; and they would give to these sacred edifices no other appellation than that of shops , or steeple-houses . No priests were admitted in their sects : Every one had received , from immediate illumination , a character much superior to the sacerdotal . When they met for divine worship , each rose up in his place , and delivered the extemporary inspirations of the Holy Ghost : Women were also admitted to teach the brethren , and were considered as proper vehicles to convey the dictates of the spirit . Sometimes a great many preachers were moved to speak at once : Sometimes a total silence prevailed in their congregation .</p>
   <p>“ Some quakers attempted to fast forty days in imitation of Christ ; and one of them bravely perished in the experiment . A female quaker came naked into the church where the protector sat ; being moved by the spirit , as she said , to appear as a sign to the people . A number of them fancied , that the renovation of all things had commenced , and that clothes were to be rejected , together with other superfluities .— The sufferings which followed the practice of this doctrine , were a species of persecution not well calculated for promoting it . ”</p>
   <p>The quakers were particularly favoured by James II ., owing to the interest which Penn , the settler of Pennsylvania , had with that monarch . That person took a lead in the controversy concerning the Indulgence , by publishing a pamphlet , entitled , “ Good Advice to the Church of England . ”</p>

   <p>The sect of free-thinkers , who professed a disbelief in revealed religion , was to be found even among the fanatical ranks of the Long Parliament . Harvey , Martin , Sidney , and others , were considered as the chiefs of this little party . After the restoration of Charles II ., these loose principles became prevalent among his gay courtiers , and were supposed to have been privately adopted by the king himself , who was educated by the sceptic Hobbes . As the free-thinkers taught a total disbelief of revelation , and indifference for religious forms , they left their disciples at liberty occasionally to conform to whatever creed , or form of worship , might appear most conducive to their temporal interests . Sunderland was supposed to belong to this sect , for he made his change to Popery , without even the form of previous instruction or conference ; evincing to the whole world , that , being totally indifferent about all religions , he was ready to embrace any that would best serve his immediate views . This statesman 's character , as a latitudinarian in religion , is mentioned with great bitterness by the Princess Anne , afterwards queen , in her private correspondence with her sister , the Princess of Orange .— See Dalrymple 's Memoirs , Vol . II . p. 169 . 8vo . edit . Dryden probably intended a sarcasm at Sunderland , or some such time-serving courtier , for his occasional conformity with the royal faith , of which there were several instances at the time . These persons , as they attended James to mass , were compared to Naaman , who , on adopting the Jewish religion , craved an indulgence for waiting upon his master to the house of the idol Rimmon . It is hinted in “ The Hind and Panther Transversed , ” that Dryden 's satire is personal ; for he is made to quote the lines , and to add , by way of commentary , “ That galls somewhere ! Egad , I cannot leave it off , though I were cudgelled every day for it . ”</p>
   <p>The church party , among other pamphlets intended to ridicule the Declaration of Indulgence , and as a parody of the addresses of the dissenters on that occasion , published , “ To the King 's Most Excellent Majesty , the Humble Address of the Atheists , or the Sect of Epicureans . ” After congratulating the king on having freed his subjects from the solemn superstition of oaths , they proceed : “ Your majesty was pleased to wish , that all your subjects were of your own religion ; and perhaps every division wishes you were of theirs ; but , for our parts , we freely declare , that if ever we should be obliged to profess any religion , we would prefer the Church of Rome , which does not much trouble the world with the affairs of invisible beings , and is very civil and indulgent to the failings of human nature . That church can ease us from the grave fatigues of religion , and , for our monies , allow us proxies , both for piety and penances : We can easily swallow and digest a wafer deity , and will never cavil at the mass in an unknown tongue , when the sacrifice itself is so unintelligible . We shall never scruple the adoration of an image , when the chiefest religion is but imagination ; and we are willing to allow the Pope an absolute power to dispense with all penal laws , in this world and in another . But before we return to Rome , the greatest origin of atheism , we wish the Pope , and all his vassal princes , would free the world from the fear of hell and devils , the inquisition and dragoons , and that he would take off the chimney-money of purgatory , and custom and excise of pardons and indulgencies , which are so much inconsistent with the flourishing trade and grandeur of the nation . As for the engagements of lives and fortunes , the common compliment of addressers , we confess we have a more peculiar tenderness for those most sacred concernments ; but yet we will hazard them in defence of your majesty , with as much constancy and resolution as your majesty will defend your indulgence ; that is , so far as the adventure will serve our designs and interest .</p>

    <head>P. 120 .</head>
    <head>The sect of Anabaptists , whose principal tenet is the disallowing of infant baptism , arose in Germany and the Low Countries about the year 1521 . This new light , for such it was esteemed , happened unfortunately to appear to some of the most ignorant and ferocious of the Low German burghers and boors . Thomas Muncer , by birth a Saxon , was the principal apostle of this sect . He preached both against the Papists and Luther , recommending the eschewing of open crimes , the chastening of the body by severities of abstinence , and the wearing a long beard . With these tenets , he combined that of an immediate intercourse with God , by demanding of him signs and tokens , which would be infallibly granted , and that of an universal community of goods . These two last doctrines , concerning spiritual and temporal matters , were admirably calculated to turn the heads of his followers . Being banished from Saxony , he seized upon the monastery of Muhlhans , from which he expelled the monks ; and afterwards made a convert of one Pfeifer , a daring enthusiast , who , because in a dream he had put to flight an innumerable number of mice , made no doubt he was destined to vanquish all principalities and powers . Muncer easily prevailed on this visionary conqueror to head the miners of the country of Mansfeldt , in some ferocious inroads into Saxony . The Dukes of Saxony and Brunswick , the Landgrave of Hesse , and other German princes , marched against these madmen , whom Muncer stimulated to resistance , by assuring them , that a rainbow , which happened then to be visible , was an indubitable sign of victory . The poor deluded wretches accordingly suffered themselves to be quietly cut to pieces , with their eyes fixed on the heavenly sign , in expectation of divine assistance . Muncer was made prisoner , and recanted before his death , only blaming the princes for their cruelty and oppression to their vassals , which drove them to desperation ;— so , if he lived a false prophet , he died a true preacher . His death , and that of Pfeifer , with the slaughter made among their followers , did not extirpate the heresy ; and the most dreadful consequences attended , for some time , the progress of these enthusiastic opinions . A tailor , called Bockholdt , better known by the name of John of Leyden , with his associates , Rotman , Matthews , and Cnipperdoling , in 1535 , actually possessed themselves of the city of Munster , expelled the bishop , and commenced the reign of the saints . Their leader , under the strange and horrible delusion that he was inspired by the Holy Ghost , played the most outrageous pranks of lust and cruelty that ever madness dictated : Yet , amidst their frenzy , the Anabaptists had valour and conduct sufficient to defend the city for a length of time against the bishop and his allies ; and while the unfortunate inhabitants were in the utmost misery , the enthusiasts themselves revelled in the indulgence of every licentious appetite . At length the city was taken , and a cruel , though deserved punishment , inflicted upon those who had been the leaders in this holy warfare . John of Leyden himself was torn to pieces with hot pincers . After this memorable event , those who retained the principles of this sect were not desirous of being distinguished by a name which the excesses of these fanatics had rendered an abomination to all the Christian world . They were generally confounded with the Independents , with whom they hold many principles in common , particularly , I believe , the disavowal of any clerical order . Yet if , for a time , they “ lurked in sects unseen , ” as Dryden assures us , the sunshine of general toleration soon brought them out under their own proper appellation . We have , among the addresses of various classes of dissenters upon the Declaration of Indulgence , that of the Anabaptists in and about the city of London , who , indeed , were the very first in expressing their thanks and loyalty . The Anabaptists of Leicestershire , the Independents and Baptists of Gloucester , the Anabaptists of Cheshire , Shropshire , and Staffordshire , &amp; c. &amp; c. &amp; c. all came forward with loyal acclamations on the same occasion .</head>

   </lg>
   <p>Arius , the propagator of a great heresy in the Christian church , denied that God the Son was equal to God the Father , or that he was co-existent with him . See page 16 . This doctrine he maintained in the council at Nice against Athanasius , the champion of orthodoxy ; and although his doctrines were condemned by the general council , and he himself banished , yet his party was so powerful as to accomplish his restoration , and the banishment of Athanasius , who fled into the Thebais , or deserts of Upper Egypt . The schism thus occasioned , continued long to divide the Christian church . Lelius Socinus , a nobleman of Sienna , revived and enlarged the doctrine of Arius , about the latter end of the sixteenth century . His nephew Faustus collected , arranged , and published his opinions , which have since had many followers . The Socinians teach the worship of one God , without distinction of persons ; affirming , that the Holy Ghost is but another expression for the power of God ; and that Jesus Christ is only the Son of God by adoption . As they deny our Saviour 's divinity , they disavow , of course , the doctrine of redemption , and consider him only as a prophet , gifted with a more than usual share of inspiration , and sealing his mission by his blood . This heresy has , at different times , and under various disguises and modifications , insinuated itself into the Christian church , forming , as it were , a resting place , though but a tottering one , between natural and revealed religion . Here , I fear , the author 's lines apply :</p>

   <p>“ Then the same day , at evening , being the first day of the week , when the doors were shut , where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews , came Jesus , and stood in the midst , and saith unto them , Peace be unto you . ”</p>
   <p>Again , “ And after eight days , again his disciples were within , and Thomas with them ; then came Jesus , the doors being shut , and stood in the midst , and said , Peace be unto you . ” — The Gospel of St John , chap . xx . verses 19 . 26 .</p>
   <p>From these passages of Scripture , Dryden endeavours to confute the objection to transubstantiation , founded on the host being consecrated in various places at the same time , in each of which , however , the body of Christ becomes present , according to the Papist doctrine . This being predicated of the real body of our Saviour , the Protestants allege is impossible , as matter can only be in one place at the same time . Dryden , in answer , assumes , that Christ entered into the meeting of the disciples , by actually passing through the closed doors of the apartment ; and as , at the moment of such passage , two bodies must have been in the same place at the same instant , the body of Jesus namely , and the substance through which he passed , the poet founds on it as an instance of a transgression of a natural law , proved from Scripture , as violent as that of one body being in several different places at once . But the text does not prove the major part of Dryden 's proposition ; it is not stated positively by the evangelist , that our Saviour passed through the doors which were shut , but merely that he came and stood among his disciples without the doors being opened ; which miraculous appearance might take place many ways besides that on which Dryden has fixed for the foundation of his argument .</p>

   <p>The personal appearance of the Presbyterian clergy was suited by an affectation of extreme plainness and rigour of appearance . A Geneva cloak and band , with the hair close cropped , and covered with a sort of black scull-cap , was the discriminating attire of their teachers . This last article of dress occasioned an unseemly projection of their ears , and procured those who affected it the nick-name of prick-eared fanatics , and the still better known appellation of Round-heads . Our author proceeds , with great bitterness , to investigate the origin of Calvinism . His account of the rise and destruction of a sect of heretics in Cambria may be understood to refer to the ancient British church , which disowned the supremacy of the see of Rome , refused to adopt her ritual , and opposed St Augustin 's claims to be metropolitan of Britain , in virtue of Pope Gregory 's appointment . They held two conferences with Augustin ; at one of which he pretended to work a miracle by the cure of a blind man ; at the second , seven British bishops , and a numerous deputation from the monastery of Bangor , disputed with Augustin , who denounced vengeance against them by the sword of the Saxons , in case they refused to submit to the see of Rome . His prophecy , which had as little effect upon the Welch clergy as his miracle , was shortly afterwards accomplished : For Ethelfred , the Saxon king of Northumberland , having defeated the British under the walls of Chester , cut to pieces no fewer than twelve hundred of the monks of Bangor , who had come to assist their countrymen with their prayers . Our author alludes to this extermination of the British recusant clergy , by comparing it to the census , or tribute of wolves-heads , imposed on the Cambrian kings . It has been surmised by some authors , that Augustin himself instigated this massacre , and thereby contributed to the accomplishment of his own prophecy . Other authorities say , that he died in 604 , and that the monks of Bangor were slain in 613 . Perhaps , however , our author did not mean to carry the rise of Presbytery so far back , but only referred to the doctrines of Wiccliff , who , in the reign of Edward III ., and his successor Richard II ., taught publicly at Oxford several doctrines inconsistent with the supremacy of the Pope , and otherwise repugnant to the doctrines of the Roman church . He was protected during his lifetime by John of Gaunt ; but , forty years after his death , his bones were dug up and burned for heresy . His followers were called Lollards , and were persecuted with great severity in the reign of Henry V ., Lord Cobham and many others being burned to death . Thinking , perhaps , either of these too honourable and ancient a descent for the English Presbyterians , our author next refers to Heylin , who brings them from Geneva ,<span corresp="#note136" type="note_anchor">[ 136 ]</span>where the reformed doctrine was taught by the well known Zuinglius , and the still more famous Calvin . The former began to preach the Reformation at Zurich about 1518 , and disputed publicly with one Sampson , a friar , whom the Pope had sent thither to distribute indulgences . Zuinglius was persecuted by the bishop of Constance ; but , being protected by the magistrates of Zurich , he set him at defiance , and in 1523 held an open disputation before the senate , with such success , that they commanded the traditions of the church to be thrown aside , and the gospel to be taught through all their canton . Zuinglius , in some respects , merited the epithet of fiery , which Dryden has given him ; he was an ardent lover of liberty , and dissuaded his countrymen from a league with the French , by which it must have been endangered ; he vindicated , from Scripture , the doctrine of resisting oppressors and asserting liberty , of which he said God was the author , and would be the defender ;<span corresp="#note137" type="note_anchor">[ 137 ]</span>and , finally , he was killed in battle between the inhabitants of Zurich and those of the five small cantons . The conquerors , being Catholics , treated his dead body with the most shameless indignity .</p>
   <p>The history of Calvin is too well known to need recital in this place . He was expelled from France , his native country , on account of his having adopted the doctrines of the reformers , and , taking refuge in Geneva , was appointed professor of divinity there in 1536 . But being afterwards obliged to retire from thence , on account of a quarrel about the administration of the communion to certain individuals , Calvin taught a French congregation at Strasburgh . He may be considered as the founder of the Presbyterian doctrine , differing from that of Luther in denying consubstantiation , and affirming , in a large extent , the doctrine of predestination , founded upon election to grace . The poet proceeds to describe the progress of this sect :</p>

     <l n="2">Your first essay was on your native laws ;</l>

     <l n="4">Your fangs you fastened on the mitred crown , }</l>

     <l n="11">In fenny Holland , and in fruitful Tweed ;</l>
     <l n="12">And like the first the last affects to be ,</l>
     <l n="13">Drawn to the dregs of a democracy .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The citizens of Geneva , before they adopted the reformed religion , were under the temporal , as well as the ecclesiastical , authority of a bishop . But , in 1528 , when they followed the example of the city of Berne , in destroying images , and abolishing the Roman ceremonies , the bishop and his clergy were expelled from the city , which from that time was considered as the cradle of Presbytery . As they had made choice of a republican form of government for their little state , our author infers , that democracy is most congenial to their new form of religion . It is no doubt true , that the Presbyterian church government is most purely democratical ; which perhaps recommended it in Holland . It is also true , that the Presbyterian divines have always preached , and their followers practised , the doctrine of resistance to oppression , whether affecting civil or religious liberty . But if Dryden had looked to his own times , he would have seen , that the Scottish Presbyterians made a very decided stand for monarchy after the death of Charles I .; and even such as were engaged in the conspiracy of Baillie of Jerviswood , which was in some respects the counter-part of the Ryehouse-plot , refused to take arms , because they suspected that the intentions of Sidney , and others of the party in England , were to establish a commonwealth . I may add , that , in latter times , no body of men have shewn themselves more attached to the king and constitution than the Presbyterian clergy of Scotland .</p>
   <p>There is room for criticism also in the poetry of these lines . I question whether fenny Holland and fruitful Tweed , in other words , a marsh and a river , could form a favourable medium for communicating the influence of the quickening fire below .</p>

   <p>It is remarkable how readily sentiments of toleration occur , even to the professors of the most intolerant religion , when their minds have fair play to attend to them . The edict of Nantes , by which Henry IV . secured to his Huguenot subjects the undisturbed exercise of their religion , was the recompense of the great obligations he owed to them , and a sort of compensation for his having preferred power to conscience ; an edict , declared unalterable , and which had even been sanctioned by Louis XIV . himself , so late as 1680 , was , in 1685 , finally abrogated . The violence with which the persecution of the Protestants was then pushed on , almost exceeds belief . The principal and least violent mode of conversion , adopted by the king and his minister Louvois , was by quartering upon those of the reformed religion large parties of soldiers , who were licenced to commit every outrage in their habitations short of rape and murder . When , by this species of persecution , a Huguenot had been once compelled to hear mass , he was afterwards treated as a relapsed heretic , if he shewed the slightest disposition to resume the religion in which he had been brought up . James II ., in two letters to the Prince of Orange , beseeching toleration for the regular priests in Holland , fails not to condemn the conduct of Louis towards his Protestant subjects ; yet , with gross inconsistency , or the deepest dissimulation , he was at the same time congratulating Barillon on his Most Christian Majesty 's care for the conversion of his subjects , and hoping God would grant him the favour of completing so great a work .<span corresp="#note138" type="note_anchor">[ 138 ]</span>And just so our author , after blaming the persecution of the Huguenots , congratulates Italy and Spain upon possessing such just and excellent laws , as the rules of the inquisitorial church courts .</p>

   <p>The dregs of the fanaticism of the last age fermented , during that of Charles II ., into various sects of sullen enthusiasts , who distinguished themselves by the different names of Brownists , Families of Love , &amp; c. &amp; c. In many cases they rejected all the usual aids of devotion , and , holding their meetings in the open air , and in solitary spots , nursed their fanaticism by separating themselves from the more rational part of mankind .

   <p>In Scotland , large conventicles were held in the mountains and morasses by the fiercest of the Covenanters , whom persecution had driven frantic . These men , known now by the name of Cameronians , considered popery and prelacy as synonymous terms ; and even stigmatized , as Erastians and self-seekers , the more moderate Presbyterians , who were contented to exercise their religion as tolerated by the government .</p>

     <l n="6">The poet alludes to the doctrine of the church of England concerning</l>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of the love that Christians ought to have among themselves one to another , but rather it is a sacrament of our redemption by Christ 's death ; insomuch , that to such as rightly , worthily , and with faith receive the same , the bread which we break is a partaking of the body of Christ , and likewise the cup of blessing is a partaking of the blood of Christ .</p>
   <p>“ Transubstantiation , or the change of the substance of bread and wine , in the Supper of the Lord , cannot be proved by holy writ ; but it is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture , overthroweth the nature of a sacrament , and hath given occasion to many superstitions .</p>
   <p>“ The body of Christ is given , taken , and eaten in the supper only , after an heavenly and spiritual manner . And the mean , whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the supper , is faith . ”</p>
   <p>Dryden insists upon a supposed inconsistency in this doctrine ; but his argument recoils upon the creed of his own church . The words of our Saviour are to be interpreted as they must have been meant when spoken ; a circumstance which excludes the literal interpretation contended for by the Romanists : For , by the words “ Hoc est corpus meum , ” our Saviour cannot be then supposed to have meant , that the morsel which he gave to his disciples was transformed into his body , which then stood before their eyes , and which all but heretics allow to have been a real , natural , human body , incapable , of course , of being multiplied into as many bodies as there were persons to partake of the communion , and of retaining its original and identical form at the same time . But unless such a multiplied transformation actually took place , our Saviour 's words to his apostles must have been emblematical only . Queen Elizabeth 's homely lines are , after all , an excellent comment on this point of divinity :</p>

     <l n="6">True to her king her principles are found ;</l>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The pretensions of the church of England to loyalty were carried to a degree of extravagance , which her divines were finally unable to support , unless they had meant to sign the destruction of their religion . This was owing to the recollection of the momentous period which had lately elapsed . The interest of the church had been deeply interwoven with that of the crown ; their struggle , sufferings , and fall , during the civil wars , had been in common , as well as their triumphant restoration : the maxim of “ no king no bishop , ” was indelibly imprinted on the hearts of the clergy ; in fine , it seemed impossible that any thing should cut asunder the ties which combined them . In sanctioning , therefore , the doctrines of the most passive loyalty , the English divines probably thought that they were only paying a tribute to the throne , which was to be returned by the streams of royal bounty and grace towards the church . Even the religion of James did not , before his accession , shake their confidence , or excite their apprehensions . They were far more afraid of the fanatics , under whose iron yoke they had so lately groaned , than of the Roman Catholics , who , for three generations , had been a depressed , and therefore a tractable body , whose ceremonies and church government resembled , in some respects , their own , and who had sided with them during the civil wars against the Protestant sectaries . But when the members of the established church perceived , that the rapid steps which James adopted would soon place the Catholics in a condition to rival , and perhaps to overpower her , they were obliged to retract and explain away many of their former hasty expressions of absolute and unconditional devotion to the royal pleasure . The king , and his Catholic counsellors , saw with astonishment and indignation , that professions of the most ample subjection were now to be understood as limited and restricted by the interests of the church . In the height of their resentment , even the church of England 's pretensions to a peculiar degree of loyalty were unthankfully turned into ridicule , in such bitter and sarcastic terms as the following , which occur in a pamphlet published expressly “ with allowance , ” i. e. by royal permission .</p>
   <p>“ I have often considered , but could never yet find a convincing reason , why that part of the nation , ( which is commonly called the church of England ) should dare appropriate to themselves alone the principles of true loyalty ; and that no other church or communion on earth can be consistent with monarchy , or , indeed , with any government .</p>
   <p>“ This is a presumption of so high a nature , that it renders the church of England a despicable enemy to the rest of mankind : For , what can be more ridiculous than to say , that a congregation of people , calling themselves a church , which cannot pretend to an infallibility even in matters of faith , having , since their first institution , made several fundamental changes of religious worship , should , however , assume to themselves an inerribility in point of civil obedience to the temporal magistrate ? Or , what can be more injurious than to aver , that no other sect or community on earth , from the rising to the setting sun , can be capable of this singular gift of loyalty ? So that the church of England alone , ( if you have faith enough to believe her own testimony ,) is that beautiful spouse of Christ , holy in her doctrine , and infallible in her duty to the supreme magistrate , whom ( by a revelation peculiar to herself ) she owns both for her temporal and spiritual head . But I doubt much , whether her ipsa dixit alone will pass current with all the nations of the universe , without making further search into the veracity of this bold assertion . ”</p>

   <p>Or Isgrim 's counsel .— P . 134 .</p>
   <p>This name for the Wolf is taken from an ancient political satire , called “ Reynard the Fox ; ” in which an account is given of the intrigues at the court of the Lion ; the impeachment of the Fox ; his various wiles and escapes ; finally , his conquering his accuser in single combat . This ancient apologue was translated from the German by the venerable Caxton , and published the 6th day of June , 1481 . It became very popular in England ; and we derive from it all the names commonly applied to animals in fable , as Reynard the fox , Tybert the cat , Bruin the bear , Isgrim the wolf , &amp; c. The original of this piece is still so highly esteemed in Germany , that it was lately modernized by Goethé , and is published among his “ Neüe Schriften . ” It is probable that this ancient satire might be the original of “ Mother Hubbard 's Tale , ” and that Dryden himself may have had something of its plan in his eye , when writing “ The Hind and Panther . ” As it had become merely a popular story-book , some of his critics did not fail to make merry with his adopting any thing from such a source . “ Smith . I have heard you quote Reynard the fox .— Bayes . Why , there 's it now ; take it from me , Mr Smith , there is as good morality , and as sound precepts , in The Delectable History of Reynard the Fox , as in any book I know , except Seneca . Pray , tell me , where , in any other author , could I have found so pretty a name for a wolf as Isgrim ? "[ 139 ]</p>

   </lg>
   <p>The author here prefers an argument much urged by the Catholic divines against those of the church of England , and which he afterwards resumes in the Second Part . The English divines , say they , halt between two opinions ; they will not allow the weight of tradition when they dispute with the church of Rome , but refer to the scripture , interpreted by each man 's private opinion , as the sole rule of faith ; while , on the other hand , they are obliged to have recourse to tradition in their disputes with the Presbyterians and dissenters , because , without its aid , they could not vindicate from scripture alone their hierarchy and church-government . To this it was answered , by the disputants on the church of England 's side , that they owned no such inconsistent opinion as was imputed to them ; but that they acknowledged , for their rule of faith , the word of God in general ; that by this they understood the written word , or scripture , in contradistinction to the Roman rule of scripture and traditions ; and as distinguished , both from the church of Rome , and from heretics and sectaries , they understood by it more particularly the written word or scripture , delivering a sense , owned and declared by the primitive church of Christ in the three creeds , four first general councils , and harmony of the fathers .</p>
   <p>Dryden 's argument , however , had been , by the Catholics , thought so sound , that it is much dwelt upon in a tract , called , “ A Remonstrance , by way of Address to both Houses of Parliament , from the Church of England , ” the object of which is to recommend an union between the churches of England and of Rome . The former is there represented as holding the following language :</p>
   <p>“ You cannot be ignorant , that ever since my separation from the church of Rome , I have been attacked by all sorts of dissenters : So that my fate , in this encounter , may be compared to that of a city , besieged by different armies , who fight both against it and one another ; where , if the garrison make a sally to damage one , another presently takes an advantage to make an attack . Thus , whilst I set myself vigorously to suppress the papist , the puritan seeks to undermine me ; and , whilst I am busied to oppose the puritan , the papist gains ground upon me . If I tell the church of Rome , I did not forsake her , but her errors , which I reformed ; my rebellious subjects tell me the same , and that they must make a thorough reformation ; and , let me bring what arguments I please , to justify my dissent , they still produce the same against me . If , on the other hand , I plead against the puritan dissenter , and show , that he ought to stand to church-authority , where he is not infallibly certain it commands a sin ; the papist presently catches at it , and tells me , I destroy my own grounds of reformation , unless I will pretend to that infallibility which I condemn in them .</p>
   <p>“ Matters standing thus betwixt me and them , why would it not be a point of prudence in me , ( as I doubt not but you would esteem it in a governor of that city I lately mentioned ,) to make peace with one of my adversaries , to the end I may with more ease resist the onsets of the other ? ”</p>

   <note xml:id="note135" place="bottom" n="135">This office was usually held by the executioner , who , to this extent , was a pluralist ; and the change was chiefly made , to prevent the necessity of producing that person in court , to the aggravation of the criminal 's terrors .</note>
   <note xml:id="note136" place="bottom" n="136">“ But separating this obliquity from the main intendment , the work was vigorously carried on by the king and his counsellors , as appears clearly by the doctrinals in the Book of Homilies , and by the practical part of Christian piety , in the first public Liturgy , confirmed by act of parliament , in the second and third year of the king ; and in that act ( and , which is more , by Fox himself ) affirmed to have been done by the especial aid of the Holy Ghost . And here the business might have rested , if Catin 's pragmatical spirit had not interposed . He first began to quarrel at some passages in this sacred liturgy , and afterwards never left soliciting the Lord Protector , and practising by his agents on the court , the country , and the universities , till he had laid the first foundation of the Zuinglian faction ; who laboured nothing more , than innovation both in doctrine and discipline ; to which they were encouraged by nothing more than some improvident indulgence granted unto John A-Lasco ; who , bringing with him a mixt multitude of Poles and Germans , obtained the privilege of a church for himself and his , distinct in government and forms of worship from the church of England .</note>
   <p>“ This gave powerful animation to the Zuinglian gospellers , ( as they are called by Bishop Hooper , and some other writers ) to practise first upon the church ; who being countenanced , if not headed , by the Earl of Warwick , ( who then began to undermine the Lord Protector ,) first quarrelled the episcopal habit , and afterwards inveighed against caps and surplices , against gowns and tippets , but fell at last upon the altars , which were left standing in all churches by the rules of liturgy . The touching on this string made excellent music to most of the grandees of the court , who had before cast many an envious eye on those costly hangings , that massy plate , and other rich and precious utensils , which adorned those altars . And what need all this waste ? said Judas , when one poor chalice only , and perhaps not that , might have served the turn . Besides , there was no small spoil to be made of copes , in which the priest officiated at the holy sacrament ; some of them being made of cloth of tissue , of cloth of gold and silver , or embroidered velvet ; the meanest being made of silk , or satin , with some decent trimming . And might not these be handsomely converted into private use , to serve as carpets for their tables , coverlids to their beds , or cushions to their chairs or windows . Thereupon some rude people are encouraged under-hand to beat down some altars , which makes way for an order of the council-table , to take down the rest , and set up tables in their places ; followed by a commission , to be executed in all parts of the kingdom , for seizing on the premises to the use of the king . ” ]</p>

      <l n="171">Provided still it were apostolic ?<span corresp="#note154" type="note_anchor">[ 154 ]</span></l>
      <l n="172">Friend , said the Hind , you quit your former ground ,</l>
      <l n="173">Where all your faith you did on scripture found :</l>
      <l n="174">Now ‘ tis tradition joined with holy writ ;</l>
      <l n="175">But thus your memory betrays your wit .</l>
      <l n="176">No , said the Panther ; for in that I view ,</l>
      <l n="177">When your tradition 's forged , and when ‘ tis true .</l>
      <l n="178">I set them by the rule , and , as they square ,}</l>
      <l n="179">Or deviate from undoubted doctrine there , }</l>
      <l n="180">This oral fiction , that old faith declare .—}</l>
      <l n="181">Hind . The council steered , it seems , a different course ;</l>
      <l n="182">They tried the scripture by tradition 's force :</l>
      <l n="183">But you tradition by the scripture try ; }</l>
      <l n="184">Pursued by sects , from this to that you fly ,}</l>
      <l n="185">Nor dare on one foundation to rely . }</l>
      <l n="186">The word is then deposed , and in this view ,</l>
      <l n="187">You rule the scripture , not the scripture you .</l>
      <l n="188">Thus said the dame , and , smiling , thus pursued :</l>
      <l n="189">I see , tradition then is disallowed ,</l>
      <l n="190">When not evinced by scripture to be true ,</l>
      <l n="191">And scripture , as interpreted by you .</l>
      <l n="192">But here you tread upon unfaithful ground ,</l>
      <l n="193">Unless you could infallibly expound ;</l>
      <l n="194">Which you reject as odious popery ,</l>
      <l n="195">And throw that doctrine back with scorn on me .</l>
      <l n="196">Suppose we on things traditive divide ,</l>
      <l n="197">And both appeal to scripture to decide ;</l>
      <l n="198">By various texts we both uphold our claim ,</l>
      <l n="199">Nay , often , ground our titles on the same :</l>
      <l n="200">After long labour lost , and time 's expence ,</l>
      <l n="201">Both grant the words , and quarrel for the sense .</l>
      <l n="202">Thus all disputes for ever must depend ;</l>
      <l n="203">For no dumb rule can controversies end .</l>
      <l n="204">Thus , when you said ,— Tradition must be tried</l>
      <l n="205">By sacred writ , whose sense yourselves decide ,</l>
      <l n="206">You said no more , but that yourselves must be</l>
      <l n="207">The judges of the scripture sense , not we .</l>
      <l n="208">Against our church-tradition you declare ,</l>
      <l n="209">And yet your clerks would sit in Moses ’ chair ;</l>
      <l n="210">At least ‘ tis proved against your argument ,</l>
      <l n="211">The rule is far from plain , where all dissent .—</l>
      <l n="212">If not by scriptures , how can we be sure ,</l>
      <l n="213">Replied the Panther , what tradition 's pure ?</l>
      <l n="214">For you may palm upon us new for old ;</l>
      <l n="215">All , as they say , that glitters , is not gold .</l>
      <l n="216">How but by following her , replied the dame ,</l>
      <l n="217">To whom derived from sire to son they came ;</l>
      <l n="218">Where every age does on another move ,</l>
      <l n="219">And trusts no farther than the next above ;</l>
      <l n="220">Where all the rounds like Jacob 's ladder rise ,</l>
      <l n="221">The lowest hid in earth , the topmost in the skies ?</l>
      <l n="222">Sternly the savage did her answer mark ,</l>
      <l n="223">Her glowing eye-balls glittering in the dark ,</l>
      <l n="224">And said but this :— Since lucre was your trade ,</l>
      <l n="225">Succeeding times such dreadful gaps have made ,</l>
      <l n="226">‘ Tis dangerous climbing : To your sons and you</l>

      <l n="228">Hind . The Panther 's breath was ever famed for sweet ;</l>

      <l n="231">Or rather did not speak , but were possessed .</l>
      <l n="232">As for your answer , ‘ tis but barely urged :</l>
      <l n="233">You must evince tradition to be forged ;</l>
      <l n="234">Produce plain proofs ; unblemished authors use</l>
      <l n="235">As ancient as those ages they accuse ;</l>
      <l n="236">Till when , ‘ tis not sufficient to defame ;</l>
      <l n="237">An old possession stands , till elder quits the claim .</l>
      <l n="238">Then for our interest , which is named alone</l>
      <l n="239">To load with envy , we retort your own ;</l>
      <l n="240">For , when traditions in your faces fly ,</l>
      <l n="241">Resolving not to yield , you must decry .</l>
      <l n="242">As when the cause goes hard , the guilty man</l>
      <l n="243">Excepts , and thins his jury all he can ;</l>
      <l n="244">So when you stand of other aid bereft ,</l>
      <l n="245">You to the twelve apostles would be left .</l>
      <l n="246">Your friend the Wolf did with more craft provide</l>
      <l n="247">To set those toys , traditions , quite aside ;<span corresp="#note157" type="note_anchor">[ 157 ]</span></l>
      <l n="248">And fathers too , unless when , reason spent ,</l>
      <l n="249">He cites them but sometimes for ornament .</l>
      <l n="250">But , madam Panther , you , though more sincere ,</l>
      <l n="251">Are not so wise as your adulterer ;</l>
      <l n="252">The private spirit is a better blind ,</l>
      <l n="253">Than all the dodging tricks your authors find .</l>
      <l n="254">For they , who left the scripture to the crowd ,}</l>
      <l n="255">Each for his own peculiar judge allowed ; }</l>
      <l n="256">The way to please them was to make them proud . }</l>
      <l n="257">Thus with full sails they ran upon the shelf ;</l>
      <l n="258">Who could suspect a cozenage from himself ?</l>
      <l n="259">On his own reason safer ‘ tis to stand ,</l>
      <l n="260">Than be deceived and damned at second-hand .</l>
      <l n="261">But you , who fathers and traditions take ,</l>
      <l n="262">And garble some , and some you quite forsake ,</l>
      <l n="263">Pretending church-authority to fix ,</l>
      <l n="264">And yet some grains of private spirit mix ,</l>
      <l n="265">Are , like a mule , made up of different seed ,</l>
      <l n="266">And that 's the reason why you never breed ;</l>
      <l n="267">At least , not propagate your kind abroad ,</l>
      <l n="268">For home dissenters are by statutes awed .</l>
      <l n="269">And yet they grow upon you every day , }</l>
      <l n="270">While you , to speak the best , are at a stay , }</l>
      <l n="271">For sects , that are extremes , abhor a middle way :}</l>
      <l n="272">Like tricks of state , to stop a raging flood ,}</l>
      <l n="273">Or mollify a mad-brained senate 's mood ; }</l>
      <l n="274">Of all expedients never one was good . }</l>
      <l n="275">Well may they argue , nor can you deny ,</l>
      <l n="276">If we must fix on church authority ,</l>
      <l n="277">Best on the best , the fountain , not the flood ;</l>
      <l n="278">That must be better still , if this be good .</l>
      <l n="279">Shall she command , who has herself rebelled ?</l>
      <l n="280">Is antichrist by antichrist expelled ?</l>
      <l n="281">Did we a lawful tyranny displace ,</l>
      <l n="282">To set aloft a bastard of the race ?</l>
      <l n="283">Why all these wars to win the book , if we }</l>
      <l n="284">Must not interpret for ourselves , but she ? }</l>
      <l n="285">Either be wholly slaves , or wholly free . }</l>
      <l n="286">For purging fires traditions must not fight ;</l>
      <l n="287">But they must prove episcopacy 's right .<span corresp="#note158" type="note_anchor">[ 158 ]</span></l>
      <l n="288">Thus , those led horses are from service freed ;</l>
      <l n="289">You never mount them but in time of need .</l>
      <l n="290">Like mercenaries , hired for home defence ,</l>
      <l n="291">They will not serve against their native prince .</l>
      <l n="292">Against domestic foes of hierarchy</l>
      <l n="293">These are drawn forth , to make fanatics fly ;</l>
      <l n="294">But , when they see their countrymen at hand , }</l>
      <l n="295">Marching against them under church-command , }</l>

      <l n="297">Thus she ; nor could the Panther well enlarge</l>
      <l n="298">With weak defence against so strong a charge ;</l>
      <l n="299">But said :— For what did Christ his word provide ,</l>
      <l n="300">If still his church must want a living guide ?</l>
      <l n="301">And if all-saving doctrines are not there ,</l>
      <l n="302">Or sacred penmen could not make them clear ,</l>
      <l n="303">From after-ages we should hope in vain</l>
      <l n="304">For truths which men inspired could not explain .—</l>
      <l n="305">Before the word was written , said the Hind ,</l>
      <l n="306">Our Saviour preached his faith to human kind :</l>
      <l n="307">From his apostles the first age received</l>
      <l n="308">Eternal truth , and what they taught believed .</l>
      <l n="309">Thus , by tradition faith was planted first ,</l>
      <l n="310">Succeeding flocks succeeding pastors nursed .</l>
      <l n="311">This was the way our wise Redeemer chose , }</l>
      <l n="312">Who sure could all things for the best dispose ,}</l>
      <l n="313">To fence his fold from their encroaching foes . }</l>
      <l n="314">He could have writ himself , but well foresaw</l>
      <l n="315">The event would be like that of Moses ’ law ;</l>
      <l n="316">Some difference would arise , some doubts remain ,</l>
      <l n="317">Like those which yet the jarring Jews maintain .</l>
      <l n="318">No written laws can be so plain , so pure ,</l>
      <l n="319">But wit may gloss , and malice may obscure ;</l>
      <l n="320">Not those indited by his first command ,</l>
      <l n="321">A prophet graved the text , an angel held his hand .</l>
      <l n="322">Thus faith was ere the written word appeared ,</l>
      <l n="323">And men believed not what they read , but heard .</l>
      <l n="324">But since the apostles could not be confined</l>
      <l n="325">To these , or those , but severally designed</l>
      <l n="326">Their large commission round the world to blow ,</l>
      <l n="327">To spread their faith , they spread their labours too .</l>
      <l n="328">Yet still their absent flock their pains did share ;</l>
      <l n="329">They hearkened still , for love produces care .</l>
      <l n="330">And as mistakes arose , or discords fell ,</l>
      <l n="331">Or bold seducers taught them to rebel ,</l>
      <l n="332">As charity grew cold , or faction hot ,</l>
      <l n="333">Or long neglect their lessons had forgot ,</l>
      <l n="334">For all their wants they wisely did provide ,</l>
      <l n="335">And preaching by epistles was supplied ;</l>
      <l n="336">So , great physicians cannot all attend ,</l>
      <l n="337">But some they visit , and to some they send .</l>
      <l n="338">Yet all those letters were not writ to all ;</l>
      <l n="339">Nor first intended but occasional ,</l>
      <l n="340">Their absent sermons ; nor , if they contain</l>
      <l n="341">All needful doctrines , are those doctrines plain .</l>
      <l n="342">Clearness by frequent preaching must be wrought</l>
      <l n="343">They writ but seldom , but they daily taught ;</l>
      <l n="344">And what one saint has said of holy Paul ,</l>
      <l n="345">“ He darkly writ , ” is true applied to all .</l>
      <l n="346">For this obscurity could heaven provide }</l>
      <l n="347">More prudently than by a living guide , }</l>
      <l n="348">As doubts arose , the difference to decide ? }</l>
      <l n="349">A guide was therefore needful , therefore made ;</l>
      <l n="350">And , if appointed , sure to be obeyed .</l>
      <l n="351">Thus , with due reverence to the apostles ’ writ ,</l>
      <l n="352">By which my sons are taught , to which submit ,</l>
      <l n="353">I think , those truths , their sacred works contain ,</l>
      <l n="354">The church alone can certainly explain ;</l>
      <l n="355">That following ages , leaning on the past ,</l>
      <l n="356">May rest upon the primitive at last .</l>
      <l n="357">Nor would I thence the word no rule infer ,</l>
      <l n="358">But none without the church-interpreter ;</l>
      <l n="359">Because , as I have urged before , ‘ tis mute ,</l>
      <l n="360">And is itself the subject of dispute .</l>
      <l n="361">But what the apostles their successors taught , }</l>
      <l n="362">They to the next , from them to us is brought , }</l>
      <l n="363">The undoubted sense which is in scripture sought . }</l>
      <l n="364">From hence the church is armed , when errors rise , }</l>
      <l n="365">To stop their entrance , and prevent surprise ; }</l>
      <l n="366">And , safe entrenched within , her foes without defies . }</l>
      <l n="367">By these all festering sores her councils heal ,}</l>
      <l n="368">Which time or has disclosed , or shall reveal ; }</l>
      <l n="369">For discord cannot end without a last appeal . }</l>
      <l n="370">Nor can a council national decide , }</l>
      <l n="371">But with subordination to her guide : }</l>
      <l n="372">( I wish the cause were on that issue tried . )}</l>
      <l n="373">Much less the scripture ; for suppose debate</l>

      <l n="459">In short , in doctrine , or in discipline ,</l>
      <l n="460">Not one reformed can with another join ;</l>

      <l n="462">No union they pretend , but in non-popery .</l>
      <l n="463">Nor , should their members in a synod meet ,</l>

      <l n="465">Above the rest , their discords to decide ;</l>
      <l n="466">None would obey , but each would be the guide ;</l>

      <l n="472">For amongst equals lies no last appeal , }</l>
      <l n="473">And all confess themselves are fallible . }</l>
      <l n="474">Now , since you grant some necessary guide ,</l>
      <l n="475">All who can err are justly laid aside ;</l>
      <l n="476">Because a trust so sacred to confer }</l>

      <l n="483">It then remains , that church can only be</l>
      <l n="484">The guide , which owns unfailing certainty ;</l>

      <l n="490">For petty royalties you raise debate ; }</l>

      <l n="505">The full extent of their Creator 's will :</l>
      <l n="506">But when the stern conditions were declared ,</l>
      <l n="507">A mournful whisper through the host was heard ,</l>

      <l n="510">Then , not till then , the Eternal Son from high</l>
      <l n="511">Rose in the strength of all the Deity ;</l>
      <l n="512">Stood forth to accept the terms , and underwent }</l>
      <l n="513">A weight which all the frame of heaven had bent ,}</l>

      <l n="516">That even the blear-eyed sects may find her out ,</l>
      <l n="517">Behold what heavenly rays adorn her brows , }</l>
      <l n="518">What from his wardrobe her beloved allows , }</l>
      <l n="519">To deck the wedding-day of his unspotted spouse ! [ 167 ]}</l>
      <l n="520">Behold what marks of majesty she brings ,</l>
      <l n="521">Richer than ancient heirs of eastern kings !</l>
      <l n="522">Her right hand holds the sceptre and the keys ,</l>

      <l n="524">With these to bind , or set the sinner free ,</l>
      <l n="525">With that to assert spiritual royalty .</l>
      <l n="526">One in herself , not rent by schism , but sound ,</l>
      <l n="527">Entire , one solid shining diamond ;</l>
      <l n="528">Not sparkles shattered into sects like you :</l>
      <l n="529">One is the church , and must be to be true ;</l>

      <l n="531">As undivided , so from errors free ; }</l>
      <l n="532">As one in faith , so one in sanctity . }</l>
      <l n="533">Thus she , and none but she , the insulting rage</l>
      <l n="534">Of heretics opposed from age to age ;</l>
      <l n="535">Still when the giant-brood invades her throne , }</l>
      <l n="536">She stoops from heaven , and meets them half way down ,}</l>
      <l n="537">And with paternal thunder vindicates her crown . }</l>

      <l n="540">To sweep away the swarms of vermin from the land ;}</l>

      <l n="543">But when the boils and blotches , with disgrace</l>
      <l n="544">And public scandal , sat upon the face ,</l>
      <l n="545">Themselves attacked , the Magi strove no more , }</l>
      <l n="546">They saw God 's finger , and their fate deplore ; }</l>

   <p>In these spirited lines , Dryden describes the dangers in which the English Catholics were involved by the Popish Plot , which rendered them so obnoxious for two years , that even Charles himself , much as he was inclined to favour them , durst not attempt to prevent the most severe measures from being adopted towards them . It is somewhat curious , that the very same metaphor of hounds and huntsmen is employed by one of the most warm advocates for the plot . “ Had this plot been a forged contrivance of their own , ( i. e . the Papists ,) they would at the very first discovery of it have had half a dozen , or half a score , crafty fellows , ready to have attested all the same things ; whereas , on the contrary , notwithstanding we are now on a burning scent , we were fain till here of late to pick out , by little and little , all upon a cold scent , and that stained too by the tricks and malice of our enemies . So that had we not had some such good huntsmen as the Right Noble Earl of Shaftesbury , to manage the chase for us , our hounds must needs have been baffled , and the game lost . ” — Appeal from the Country to the City .

   <p>The country party , during the 1679 , and the succeeding years , were as much incensed against the divines of the high church of England as against the Papists . The furious pamphlet , quoted in the last note , divides the enemies of this country into four classes ; officers , courtiers , over-hot churchmen , and papists . “ Over-hot churchmen , ” it continues , “ are bribed to wish well to popery , by the hopes , if not of a cardinal 's cap , yet at least by a command over some abbey , priory , or other ecclesiastical preferment whereof the Romish church hath so great plenty . These are the men , who exclaim against our parliament 's proceedings , in relation to the plot , as too violent , calling these times by no other name than that of forty or forty-one ;<span corresp="#note181" type="note_anchor">[ 181 ]</span>when , to amuse as well his sacred majesty as his good people , they again threaten us with another forty-eight ; and all this is done to vindicate underhand the Catholic party , by throwing a suspicion on the fanatics . These are the gentlemen who so magnify the principles of Bishop Laud , and so much extol the writings of that same late spirited prelate Dr Heylin , who hath made more Papists , by his books than Christians by his sermons . These are those episcopal Tantivies , who can make even the very scriptures pimp for the court , who out of Urim and Thummim can extort a sermon , to prove the not paying of tithes and taxes to be the sin against the Holy Ghost ; and had rather see the kingdom run down with blood , than part with the least hem of a sanctified frock , which they themselves made holy . ” — Appeal , &amp; c. State Tracts , p. 403 . In a very violent tract , written expressly against the influence of the clergy ,<span corresp="#note182" type="note_anchor">[ 182 ]</span>they are charged with being the principal instruments of the court in corrupting elections . “ I find , ” says the author , when talking of the approaching general election , “ all persons very forward to countenance this public work , except the high-flown ritualists and ceremony-mongers of the clergy , who , being in the conspiracy against the people , lay themselves out to accommodate their masters with the veriest villains that can be picked up in all the country , that so we may fall into the hands again of as treacherous and lewd a parliament , as the wisdom of God and folly of man has most miraculously dissolved . To which end they traduce all worthy men for fanatics , schismatics , or favourers of them . Nay , do but pitch upon a gentleman , who believes it his duty to serve his God , his king , and country , faithfully , they cry him down as a person dangerous and disaffected to the government ; thinking thereby to scare the people from the freedom of their choice , and then impose their hair-brained journeymen and half-witted fops upon them . ” In Shadwell 's Whig play , called “ The Lancashire Witches , ” he has introduced an high-flying chaplain , as the expression then run , and an Irish priest , who are described as very ready to accommodate each other in all religious tenets , since they agree in disbelieving the popish plot , and in believing that ascribed to the fanatics . These , out of a thousand instances , may serve to show , how closely the country party in the time of Charles II . were disposed to identify the interests of Rome , and of the high church of England . Dryden is therefore well authorised to say , that both communions were aimed at by that cabal , which pushed on the investigation of the supposed plot .</p>

   <p>The test , it seems , at last has loosed your tongue .— P . 162 .</p>
   <p>If there was any ambiguity in the church of England 's doctrine concerning the eucharist , it was fully explained by the memorable Test Act , passed in 1678 , during the heat of the Popish Plot , by which all persons holding public offices were required , under pain of disqualification , to disown the doctrine of transubstantiation , in the most explicit terms , as also that of image worship . This bill was pressed forwards with great violence by the country party . “ I would not , ” said one of their orators , “ have a popishman , or a popish woman , remain here ; not a popish dog , or a popish bitch ; not so much as a popish cat , to pur and mew about the king . ” Many of the church of England party opposed this test , from an idea that it was prejudicial to the interests of the crown .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Dryden does not plead the cause of infallibility so high as to declare it lodged in the pope alone ; but inclines to the milder and more moderate opinion , which vests it in the church and pope jointly . This was the shape in which the doctrine was stated in the pamphlets generally dispersed from the king 's printing-press about this time ; whether because James really held the opinion of the Ultramontane , or Gallican church , in this point , or that he thought the more moderate statement was most likely to be acceptable to new converts . In a dialogue betwixt a Missioner and a Plain Man , printed along with the Rosary , in a very small form , and apparently designed for very extensive circulation , the question is thus stated :</p>
   <p>“ Plain Man . How shall I know what the church teaches , and by what means may I come to know her infallible doctrine ?</p>
   <p>“ Missioner . In those cases , she speaks to us by her supreme courts of judicature , her general councils , which , being the legal representatives of her whole body , she is secured from erring in them as to all things which appertain to faith . ”</p>

   <p>This ultimate appeal to the scriptures against the authority of the church , as it is what the church of Rome has most to dread , is most combated by her followers . Dryden , like a good courtier , adopts here , as well as elsewhere , the arguments which converted his master , Charles II . “ We declare , ” says the king in his first paper , “ to believe one Catholic and apostolic church ; and it is not left to every phantastical man 's head to believe as he pleases , but to the church , to whom Christ left the power upon earth , to govern us in matters of faith , who made these creeds for our directions . It were a very irrational thing to make laws for a country , and leave it to the inhabitants to be interpreters and judges of those laws : For then every man will be his own judge ; and , by consequence , no such thing as either right or wrong . Can we therefore suppose , that God Almighty would leave us at those uncertainties , as to give us a rule to go by , and leave every man to be his own judge ? I do ask any ingenuous man , Whether it be not the same thing to follow our own phancy , or to interpret the scripture by it ? I would have any man shew me , where the power of deciding matters of faith is given to every particular man . Christ left his power to his church , even to forgive sins in heaven ; and left his Spirit with them , which they exercised after his resurrection ; first by his apostles in their creed , and many years after by the council at Nice , where that creed was made that is called by that name ; and by the power which they had received from Christ , they were the judges even of the scripture itself many years after the apostles , which books were canonical , and which were not . ” Papers found in King Charles 's strong box .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Dryden had previously attacked the rule of faith , by private judgment of the Holy Scriptures . His assumption is , that the scriptures having been often misunderstood and abused by heretics of various descriptions , there must be some more infallible guide left us by God as the rule of faith . Instead of trusting , therefore , to individual judgment founded on the scripture , he urges , that the infallibility of faith depends upon oral tradition , handed down , as his communion pretends , by father to son , from the times of the primitive church till this very day . It is upon this foundation that the church of Rome rests her claim to infallibility , as the immediate representative of the apostles and primitive church .</p>

     <l n="1">For purging fires traditions must not fight ;</l>
     <l n="2">But they must prove episcopacy 's right .— P . 170 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The doctrine of purgatory , and prayers for the dead , is founded on a passage in the book of Tobit . The Apocrypha not being absolutely rejected by the church of England , but admitted for “ example of life and instruction of manners , ” though not of canonical authority , part of this curious and romantic history is read in the course of the calendar . The domestic circumstance of the dog gave unreasonable scandal to the Puritans , from which the following is a good-humoured vindication . “ Give me leave for once to intercede for that poor dog , because he is a dog of good example , for he was faithful , and loved his master ; besides , that he never troubles the church on Sundays , when people have their best clothes on ; only on a week-day , when scrupulous brethren are always absent , the poor cur makes bold to follow his master . ” But although the church of England did not receive the traditive belief , founded upon the aforesaid passage concerning prayer for the dead , the dissenters accused her of liberal reference to tradition in the disputes concerning the office of bishop , the nature of which is in the New Testament left somewhat dubious .</p>

     <l n="3">Here then you shrink , and lay your weak pretensions down . P. 176 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Much of the preceding argument , and this conclusion , is founded upon the following passage in the second paper found in King Charles 's strong box . “ It is a sad thing to consider what a world of heresies are crept into this nation . Every man thinks himself as competent a judge of the scriptures as the very apostles themselves ; and ‘ tis no wonder that it should be so , since that part of the nation which looks most like a church , dares not bring the true arguments against the other sects , for fear they should be turned against themselves , and confuted by their own arguments . The church of England , as ‘ tis called , would fain have it thought , that they are the judges in matters spiritual , and yet dare not positively say , that there is no appeal from them ; for either they must say , that they are infallible , which they cannot pretend to , or confess , that what they decide in matters of conscience is no further to be followed , than as it agrees with every man 's private judgment . ”</p>
   <p>To this the divines of England answered , that they indeed asserted church authority , but without pretending to infallibility ; and that while the church decided upon points of faith , she was to be directed and guided by the scriptures , just as the judges of a temporal tribunal are to frame their decisions , not from any innate or infallible authority of their own , but in conformity with the laws of the realm .</p>

   <p>In this and the following lines Dryden sets forth his adopted mother-church in all the glowing attributes of majesty and authority . The lines are extremely beautiful , and their policy is obvious , from the following passage in a pretended letter from Father Petre to Father La Chaise . The letter bears every mark indeed of forgery ; but it is equally an illustration of Dryden , whether the policy contained in it was attributed by the Protestants to the Catholics as part of their scheme , or was really avowed as such by themselves . “ Many English heretics resort often to our sermons ; and I have often recommended to our fathers to preach now in the beginning as little as they can of the controversy , because that provokes ; but to represent to them the beauty and antiquity of the Catholic religion , that they may be convinced that all that has been said and preached to them , and their own reflections concerning it , have been all scandal . ” — Somers ’ Tracts , p. 253 . The unity of the Catholic church was also chiefly insisted on during the controversy :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">One in herself , not rent by schism , but sound ,</l>
     <l n="2">Entire ; one solid , shining diamond ,</l>
     <l n="3">Not sparkles shattered into sects like you ;</l>
     <l n="4">One is the church , and must be to be true .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It seems to have escaped Dryden , that all the various sects which have existed , and do now exist , in the Christian world , may , in some measure , be said to be sparkles shattered from his “ solid diamond ; ” since at one time all Christendom belonged to the Roman church . Thus the disunion of the various sects of Protestants is no more an argument against the church of England than it is against the church of Rome , or the Christian faith in general . All communions insist on the same privilege ; and when the church of Rome denounced the Protestants as heretics , like Coriolanus going into exile , they returned the sentence against her who gave it . If it is urged , that , notwithstanding these various defections , the Roman church retained the most extended communion , this plea would place the truth of religious opinions upon the hazardous basis of numbers , which Mahometans might plead more successfully than any Christian church , in proportion as their faith is more widely extended . These arguments of the unity and extent of the church are thus expressed in a missionary tract already quoted , where the Plain Man thus addresses his English parson : “ Either shew me , by more plain and positive texts of scripture than what the Missioner has here brought , that God Almighty has promised to preserve his church from essential errors , such as are idolatry , superstition , &amp; c .; or else shew me a church visible in all ages spread over the face of the whole world , secured from such errors , and at unity in itself . A church , that has had all along kings for nursing fathers , and queens for nursing mothers ; a church , to which all nations have flowed , and which is authorised to teach them infallibly all those truths which were delivered to the saints without mixtures of error , which destroy sanctity ; I say , either shew me , from plain texts of scripture , that Christ 's church was not to be my infallible guide ; or shew me such a church of Christ as these promises require , distinct from that of the Roman , and from which she has either separated , or been cut off . ”</p>

   <p>The author has , a little above , used an argument , much to the honour of the Catholic church — her unceasing diligence in labouring for the conversion of the heathen ; a task , in which her missionaries have laboured with unwearied assiduity , encountering fatigue , danger , and martyrdom itself , in winning souls to the faith . It has been justly objected , that the spiritual instruction of their converts is but slight and superficial ; yet still their missionary zeal forms a strong contrast to the indifference of the reformed churches in this duty . Nothing of the kind has ever been attempted on a great or national scale by the church of England , which gives Catholics room to upbraid her clergy with their unambitious sloth in declining the dignity of becoming bishops in partibus infidelium . The poet goes on to state the scandalous materials with which it has been the universal custom of Britain to supply the population of her colonies ; the very dregs and outcasts of humanity being the only recruits whom she destines to establish the future marts for her commodities . The success of such missionaries among the savage tribes , who have the misfortune to be placed in their vicinity , may be easily guessed :</p>

     <l n="3">And gave them back their own . Wordsworth .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>On the other hand , the care of the Catholic missionaries was by no means limited to the spiritual concerns of those heathen among whom they laboured : they extended them to their temporal concerns , and sometimes unfortunately occasioned grievous civil dissensions , and much bloodshed . Something of this kind took place in Japan ; where the Christians , having raised a rebellion against the heathens , ( for the beaten party , as Dryden says , are always rebels to the victors ,) were exterminated , root and branch . This excited such an utter hatred of Catholic priests , and their religion , that they were prohibited , under the deepest denunciations of death and confiscation , from landing in Japan . Nevertheless , the severity of this law did not prevent the Hollanders from sharing in the gainful traffic of the island , which they gained permission to do , by declaring , that they were not Christians , ( only meaning , we hope , that they were not Catholics ,) but Dutchmen ; and it was currently believed , that , in corroboration of their assertion , they were required to trample upon the crucifix , the object of adoration to those whom the Japanese had formerly known under the name of Christians .</p>

   <p>The English Benedictine monks executed a renunciation of the abbey lands , belonging to the order before the Reformation , in order to satisfy the minds of the possessors , and reconcile them to the re-establishment of the ancient religion , by guaranteeing the stability of their property . There appeared , however , to the proprietors of these lands , little generosity in this renunciation , in case the monks were to remain in a condition of inability to support their pretended claim ; and , on the other hand , some reason to suspect its validity , should they ever be strong enough to plead their title . The king 's declaration of indulgence contained a promise upon this head , which appeared equally ominous : He declared , that he would maintain his loving subjects in their properties and possessions , “ as well of church and abbey lands as of any other . ” The only effect of this clause was to make men enquire , whether popery was so near being established as to make such a promise necessary ; and if so , how far the promise itself was to be relied upon , in opposition to the doctrine of resumption , which had always been enforced by the Roman see , even when these church lands fell into the hands of persons of their own persuasion , unless they were dedicated to pious uses . Nor were there wanting persons to remind the proprietors of such lands , that the canons declared that even the pope had no authority to confirm the alienation of the property of the church ; that the general council of Trent had solemnly anathematized all who detained church lands ; that the Monasticon Anglicanum was carefully preserved in the Vatican as a rule for the intended resumption ; and that the reigning pope had obstinately refused to confirm any such alienations by his bulls , though the doing so at this crisis might have removed a great obstacle to the growth of Popery in England .— See , in the State Tracts , a piece called “ Abbey Lands not assured to Roman Catholics , ” Vol . 1. p. 326 ; and more especially a tract , by some ascribed to Burnet , and by others to Sir William Coventry , entitled , “ A Letter written to Dr Burnet , giving some account of Cardinal Pole 's secret powers ; from which it appears , that it never was intended to confirm the Alienation that was made of the Abbey Lands . To which are added , Two Breves that Cardinal Pole brought over , and some other of his Letters that were never before printed , 1685 . ”</p>

   <p>The aurora borealis was an uncommon spectacle in England during the 17th century . Its occasional appearance , however , gave foundation to those tales of armies fighting in the air , and similar phenomena with which the credulity of the vulgar was amused . The author seems to allude to some extraordinary display of the aurora borealis on the evening of the battle of Sedgemuir , which was chiefly fought by night . I do not find the circumstance noticed elsewhere . Dryden attests it by his personal evidence .</p>

   <p>This seems to be a sarcasm of the same kind with the following : “ But , ” says the zealous Protestant of the mother church , “ if you repeal the test , you take away the bulwark that defends the church ; for if that were once demolished , the enemy would rush in and possess all ; and it is a delicate innocent church that cannot be safe but in a fortified place . ” — “ I must confess , it is a great argument of her modesty to own herself weak and unable to subsist without the support of parliamentary laws , to hang , draw , or quarter her opposers , and without a coercive power in herself to fine and excommunicate all recusants and nonconformists . "[ 183 ] One would wish to ask this Catholic advocate for universal toleration , if he had ever heard of a court in Popish countries for the prevention of heresy , generally called the Inquisition ?</p>

      <l n="9">Has sharply blamed a British lioness ;</l>

      <l n="15">For brutes to claim the privilege of men .</l>
      <l n="16">Others our Hind of folly will indite ,</l>
      <l n="17">To entertain a dangerous guest by night .</l>
      <l n="18">Let those remember , that she cannot die ,</l>
      <l n="19">Till rolling time is lost in round eternity ;</l>
      <l n="20">Nor need she fear the Panther , though untamed ,</l>
      <l n="21">Because the Lion 's peace was now proclaimed ;<span corresp="#note185" type="note_anchor">[ 185 ]</span></l>
      <l n="22">The wary savage would not give offence ,</l>
      <l n="23">To forfeit the protection of her prince ;</l>
      <l n="24">But watched the time her vengeance to complete ,</l>
      <l n="25">When all her furry sons in frequent senate met ;<span corresp="#note186" type="note_anchor">[ 186 ]</span></l>
      <l n="26">Meanwhile she quenched her fury at the flood ,</l>
      <l n="27">And with a lenten sallad cooled her blood .</l>
      <l n="28">Their commons , though but coarse , were nothing scant ,</l>
      <l n="29">Nor did their minds an equal banquet want .</l>
      <l n="30">For now the Hind , whose noble nature strove</l>
      <l n="31">To express her plain simplicity of love ,</l>
      <l n="32">Did all the honours of her house so well ,</l>
      <l n="33">No sharp debates disturbed the friendly meal .</l>
      <l n="34">She turned the talk , avoiding that extreme ,</l>
      <l n="35">To common dangers past , a sadly-pleasing theme ;</l>
      <l n="36">Remembering every storm which tossed the state , }</l>
      <l n="37">When both were objects of the public hate , }</l>
      <l n="38">And dropt a tear betwixt for her own childrens ’ fate . }</l>
      <l n="39">Nor failed she then a full review to make</l>
      <l n="40">Of what the Panther suffered for her sake ;</l>
      <l n="41">Her lost esteem , her truth , her loyal care ,</l>
      <l n="42">Her faith unshaken to an exiled heir ,</l>
      <l n="43">Her strength to endure , her courage to defy ,</l>
      <l n="44">Her choice of honourable infamy .<span corresp="#note187" type="note_anchor">[ 187 ]</span></l>
      <l n="45">On these , prolixly thankful , she enlarged ;</l>
      <l n="46">Then with acknowledgment herself she charged ;</l>
      <l n="47">For friendship , of itself an holy tie ,</l>
      <l n="48">Is made more sacred by adversity .</l>
      <l n="49">Now should they part , malicious tongues would say ,</l>
      <l n="50">They met like chance companions on the way ,</l>
      <l n="51">Whom mutual fear of robbers had possessed ;</l>
      <l n="52">While danger lasted , kindness was professed ;</l>
      <l n="53">But , that once o'er , the short-lived union ends ,</l>
      <l n="54">The road divides , and there divide the friends .</l>
      <l n="55">The Panther nodded , when her speech was done ,</l>
      <l n="56">And thanked her coldly in a hollow tone ;</l>
      <l n="57">But said , her gratitude had gone too far</l>
      <l n="58">For common offices of Christian care .</l>
      <l n="59">If to the lawful heir she had been true ,</l>
      <l n="60">She paid but Cæsar what was Cæsar 's due .</l>
      <l n="61">I might , she added , with like praise describe</l>
      <l n="62">Your suffering sons , and so return your bribe :</l>
      <l n="63">But incense from my hands is poorly prized ;</l>
      <l n="64">For gifts are scorned where givers are despised .</l>
      <l n="65">I served a turn , and then was cast away ; }</l>
      <l n="66">You , like the gaudy fly , your wings display , }</l>
      <l n="67">And sip the sweets , and bask in your great patron 's day .— [ 188 ]}</l>
      <l n="68">This heard , the matron was not slow to find</l>
      <l n="69">What sort of malady had seized her mind ;</l>
      <l n="70">Disdain , with gnawing envy , fell despite ,</l>
      <l n="71">And cankered malice , stood in open sight ;</l>
      <l n="72">Ambition , interest , pride without controul ,</l>
      <l n="73">And jealousy , the jaundice of the soul ;</l>
      <l n="74">Revenge , the bloody minister of ill ,</l>
      <l n="75">With all the lean tormentors of the will .</l>
      <l n="76">‘ Twas easy now to guess from whence arose</l>
      <l n="77">Her new-made union with her ancient foes ;</l>
      <l n="78">Her forced civilities , her faint embrace ,</l>
      <l n="79">Affected kindness , with an altered face ;</l>
      <l n="80">Yet durst she not too deeply probe the wound ,</l>
      <l n="81">As hoping still the nobler parts were sound ;</l>
      <l n="82">But strove with anodynes to assuage the smart ,</l>
      <l n="83">And mildly thus her medicine did impart .</l>
      <l n="84">Complaints of lovers help to ease their pain ;</l>
      <l n="85">It shows a rest of kindness to complain ;</l>
      <l n="86">A friendship loth to quit its former hold ,</l>
      <l n="87">And conscious merit , may be justly bold ;</l>
      <l n="88">But much more just your jealousy would shew ,</l>
      <l n="89">If others ’ good were injury to you :</l>
      <l n="90">Witness , ye heavens , how I rejoice to see</l>
      <l n="91">Rewarded worth and rising loyalty !</l>
      <l n="92">Your warrior offspring , that upheld the crown ,</l>
      <l n="93">The scarlet honour of your peaceful gown ,</l>
      <l n="94">Are the most pleasing objects I can find ,</l>
      <l n="95">Charms to my sight , and cordials to my mind :</l>
      <l n="96">When virtue spooms<span corresp="#note189" type="note_anchor">[ 189 ]</span>before a prosperous gale ,</l>
      <l n="97">My heaving wishes help to fill the sail ;</l>
      <l n="98">And if my prayers for all the brave were heard ,</l>
      <l n="99">Cæsar should still have such , and such should still reward .</l>
      <l n="100">The laboured earth your pains have sowed and tilled ,</l>
      <l n="101">‘ Tis just you reap the product of the field :</l>
      <l n="102">Yours be the harvest ; ‘ tis the beggar 's gain ,</l>
      <l n="103">To glean the fallings of the loaded wain .</l>
      <l n="104">Such scattered ears as are not worth your care ,}</l>
      <l n="105">Your charity , for alms , may safely spare , }</l>
      <l n="106">For alms are but the vehicles of prayer . }</l>
      <l n="107">My daily bread is literally implored ;</l>
      <l n="108">I have no barns nor granaries to hoard .</l>
      <l n="109">If Cæsar to his own his hand extends , }</l>
      <l n="110">Say which of yours his charity offends ; }</l>
      <l n="111">You know , he largely gives to more than are his friends . }</l>
      <l n="112">Are you defrauded , when he feeds the poor ?</l>
      <l n="113">Our mite decreases nothing of your store .</l>
      <l n="114">I am but few , and by your fare you see</l>
      <l n="115">My crying sins are not of luxury .</l>
      <l n="116">Some juster motive sure your mind withdraws , }</l>
      <l n="117">And makes you break our friendship 's holy laws ;}</l>
      <l n="118">For barefaced envy is too base a cause . }</l>
      <l n="119">Show more occasion for your discontent ;</l>
      <l n="120">Your love , the Wolf , would help you to invent :</l>
      <l n="121">Some German quarrel , or , as times go now ,</l>
      <l n="122">Some French ,<span corresp="#note190" type="note_anchor">[ 190 ]</span>where force is uppermost , will do .</l>
      <l n="123">When at the fountain 's head , as merit ought</l>
      <l n="124">To claim the place , you take a swilling draught ,</l>
      <l n="125">How easy ‘ tis an envious eye to throw ,</l>
      <l n="126">And tax the sheep for troubling streams below ;</l>
      <l n="127">Or call her , when no farther cause you find ,</l>
      <l n="128">An enemy professed of all your kind !</l>
      <l n="129">But , then , perhaps , the wicked world would think ,</l>
      <l n="130">The Wolf designed to eat as well as drink .—</l>
      <l n="131">This last allusion galled the Panther more ,</l>
      <l n="132">Because , indeed , it rubbed upon the sore ;</l>
      <l n="133">Yet seemed she not to wince , though shrewdly pained ,</l>
      <l n="134">But thus her passive character maintained .</l>
      <l n="135">I never grudged , whate'er my foes report ,</l>
      <l n="136">Your flaunting fortune in the Lion 's court .</l>
      <l n="137">You have your day , or you are much belied ,</l>
      <l n="138">But I am always on the suffering side ;</l>
      <l n="139">You know my doctrine , and I need not say ,</l>
      <l n="140">I will not , but I cannot disobey .</l>
      <l n="141">Their malice too a sore suspicion brings ,</l>
      <l n="142">For , though they dare not bark , they snarl at kings .</l>
      <l n="143">On this firm principle I ever stood ; }</l>
      <l n="144">He of my sons who fails to make it good , }</l>
      <l n="145">By one rebellious act renounces to my blood . [ 191 ]}</l>
      <l n="146">Ah , said the Hind , how many sons have you ,</l>
      <l n="147">Who call you mother , whom you never knew !</l>
      <l n="148">But most of them , who that relation plead ,</l>
      <l n="149">Are such ungracious youths as wish you dead .</l>
      <l n="150">They gape at rich revenues which you hold ,</l>
      <l n="151">And fain would nibble at your grandame gold ;</l>
      <l n="152">Enquire into your years , and laugh to find</l>
      <l n="153">Your crazy temper shows you much declined .</l>
      <l n="154">Were you not dim and doated , you might see }</l>
      <l n="155">A pack of cheats that claim a pedigree , }</l>
      <l n="156">No more of kin to you , than you to me . }</l>
      <l n="157">Do you not know , that , for a little coin ,</l>
      <l n="158">Heralds can foist a name into the line ?</l>
      <l n="159">They ask you blessing but for what you have , }</l>
      <l n="160">But , once possessed of what with care you save ,}</l>
      <l n="161">The wanton boys would piss upon your grave . }</l>
      <l n="162">Your sons of latitude , that court your grace ,}</l>
      <l n="163">Though most resembling you in form and face , }</l>
      <l n="164">Are far the worst of your pretended race ; }</l>
      <l n="165">And , but I blush your honesty to blot ,</l>
      <l n="166">Pray God you prove them lawfully begot !</l>
      <l n="167">For , in some Popish libels I have read ,</l>
      <l n="168">The Wolf has been too busy in your bed ;<span corresp="#note192" type="note_anchor">[ 192 ]</span></l>
      <l n="169">At least their hinder parts , the belly-piece ,</l>
      <l n="170">The paunch , and all that Scorpio claims ,<span corresp="#note193" type="note_anchor">[ 193 ]</span>are his .</l>

      <l n="173">Think you , your new French proselytes are come ,</l>
      <l n="174">To starve abroad , because they starved at home ?</l>
      <l n="175">Your benefices twinkled from afar ,</l>
      <l n="176">They found the new Messiah by the star ;</l>
      <l n="177">Those Swisses fight on any side for pay ,</l>
      <l n="178">And ‘ tis the living that conforms , not they .</l>
      <l n="179">Mark with what management their tribes divide ; }</l>
      <l n="180">Some stick to you , and some to t'other side , }</l>
      <l n="181">That many churches may for many mouths provide . [ 194 ]}</l>
      <l n="182">More vacant pulpits would more converts make ;</l>
      <l n="183">All would have latitude enough to take :</l>
      <l n="184">The rest unbeneficed your sects maintain ;}</l>
      <l n="185">For ordinations , without cures , are vain ,}</l>
      <l n="186">And chamber practice is a silent gain . }</l>
      <l n="187">Your sons of breadth at home are much like these ;</l>
      <l n="188">Their soft and yielding metals run with ease ;</l>
      <l n="189">They melt , and take the figure of the mould ,</l>
      <l n="190">But harden and preserve it best in gold .—</l>
      <l n="191">Your Delphic sword , the Panther then replied ,</l>
      <l n="192">Is double-edged , and cuts on either side .</l>
      <l n="193">Some sons of mine , who bear upon their shield</l>
      <l n="194">Three steeples argent in a sable field ,</l>
      <l n="195">Have sharply taxed your converts , who , unfed ,</l>
      <l n="196">Have followed you for miracles of bread ;<span corresp="#note195" type="note_anchor">[ 195 ]</span></l>
      <l n="197">Such , who themselves of no religion are ,</l>
      <l n="198">Allured with gain , for any will declare .</l>
      <l n="199">Bare lies , with bold assertions , they can face ;</l>
      <l n="200">But dint of argument is out of place .</l>

      <l n="207">That conscience , conscience would not let him rest ,—<span corresp="#note197" type="note_anchor">[ 197 ]</span></l>
      <l n="208">I mean , not till possessed of her he loved ,</l>
      <l n="209">And old , uncharming Catherine was removed .</l>
      <l n="210">For sundry years before he did complain ,</l>
      <l n="211">And told his ghostly confessor his pain .</l>
      <l n="212">With the same impudence , without a ground , }</l>
      <l n="213">They say , that , look the reformation round ,}</l>
      <l n="214">No treatise of humility is found .<span corresp="#note198" type="note_anchor">[ 198 ]</span>}</l>
      <l n="215">But if none were , the gospel does not want ; }</l>
      <l n="216">Our Saviour preached it , and I hope you grant ,}</l>
      <l n="217">The sermon on the mount was protestant .— }</l>
      <l n="218">No doubt , replied the Hind , as sure as all }</l>
      <l n="219">The writings of Saint Peter and Saint Paul ; }</l>
      <l n="220">On that decision let it stand , or fall . }</l>
      <l n="221">Now for my converts , who , you say , unfed ,</l>
      <l n="222">Have followed me for miracles of bread .</l>
      <l n="223">Judge not by hearsay , but observe at least ,</l>
      <l n="224">If since their change their loaves have been increased .</l>
      <l n="225">The Lion buys no converts ; if he did ,</l>
      <l n="226">Beasts would be sold as fast as he could bid .</l>
      <l n="227">Tax those of interest , who conform for gain ,</l>

      <l n="229">Your broad-way sons<span corresp="#note199" type="note_anchor">[ 199 ]</span>would never be too nice</l>
      <l n="230">To close with Calvin , if he paid their price ;</l>
      <l n="231">But , raised three steeples higher , would change their note ,</l>

      <l n="235">Meantime , my sons accused , by fame 's report ,</l>
      <l n="236">Pay small attendance at the Lion 's court ,</l>
      <l n="237">Nor rise with early crowds , nor flatter late ;</l>

      <l n="429">Pursues the sun , in summer brisk and bold ,</l>

      <l n="444">And seek a better heaven , and warmer climes .</l>
      <l n="445">Her sons were summoned on a steeple 's height ,</l>

      <l n="448">All to the general rendezvous repair , }</l>
      <l n="449">They try their fluttering wings , and trust themselves in air . }</l>
      <l n="450">But whether upward to the moon they go , }</l>
      <l n="451">Or dream the winter out in caves below , }</l>
      <l n="452">Or hawk at flies elsewhere , concerns us not to know . }</l>
      <l n="453">Southwards you may be sure they bent their flight ,}</l>
      <l n="454">And harboured in a hollow rock at night ; }</l>
      <l n="455">Next morn they rose , and set up every sail ;</l>
      <l n="456">The wind was fair , but blew a mackrel gale ;</l>
      <l n="457">The sickly young sat shivering on the shore ,</l>
      <l n="458">Abhorred salt-water never seen before .</l>

      <l n="461">With these the Martin readily concurred ,</l>
      <l n="462">A church bigot , and church-believing bird ;</l>

      <l n="474">His fear foretold foul weather in the sky .</l>

      <l n="479">A seeming pious care , that covered cowardice . }</l>
      <l n="480">To strengthen this , he told a boding dream ,</l>

      <l n="482">Sure signs of anguish , dangers , and distress ,</l>
      <l n="483">With something more , not lawful to express :</l>
      <l n="484">By which he slily seemed to intimate</l>
      <l n="485">Some secret revelation of their fate .</l>
      <l n="486">For he concluded , once upon a time ,</l>
      <l n="487">He found a leaf inscribed with sacred rhyme ,</l>
      <l n="488">Whose antique characters did well denote</l>
      <l n="489">The Sibyl 's hand of the Cumæan grot ;</l>

      <l n="492">In which , sinister destinies ordain , }</l>
      <l n="493">A dame should drown with all her feathered train , }</l>

      <l n="495">At this , some shook for fear ; the more devout</l>
      <l n="496">Arose , and blessed themselves from head to foot .</l>
      <l n="497">‘ Tis true , some stagers of the wiser sort</l>
      <l n="498">Made all these idle wonderments their sport ;</l>
      <l n="499">They said , their only danger was delay , }</l>
      <l n="500">And he , who heard what every fool could say , }</l>
      <l n="501">Would never fix his thought , but trim his time away . }</l>
      <l n="502">The passage yet was good ; the wind , ‘ tis true , }</l>
      <l n="503">Was somewhat high , but that was nothing new , }</l>
      <l n="504">No more than usual equinoxes blew . }</l>
      <l n="505">The sun , already from the Scales declined , }</l>
      <l n="506">Gave little hopes of better days behind , }</l>
      <l n="507">But change from bad to worse , of weather and of wind . }</l>
      <l n="508">Nor need they fear the dampness of the sky }</l>
      <l n="509">Should flag their wings , and hinder them to fly , }</l>
      <l n="510">‘ Twas only water thrown on sails too dry . }</l>
      <l n="511">But , least of all , philosophy presumes</l>
      <l n="512">Of truth in dreams , from melancholy fumes ;</l>
      <l n="513">Perhaps the Martin , housed in holy ground ,</l>
      <l n="514">Might think of ghosts , that walk their midnight round ,</l>
      <l n="515">Till grosser atoms , tumbling in the stream</l>
      <l n="516">Of fancy , madly met , and clubbed into a dream :</l>
      <l n="517">As little weight his vain presages bear ,</l>
      <l n="518">Of ill effect to such alone who fear ;</l>
      <l n="519">Most prophecies are of a piece with these ,</l>
      <l n="520">Each Nostradamus can foretel with ease :</l>
      <l n="521">Not naming persons , and confounding times ,</l>
      <l n="522">One casual truth supports a thousand lying rhymes .</l>
      <l n="523">The advice was true ; but fear had seized the most ,</l>
      <l n="524">And all good counsel is on cowards lost .</l>
      <l n="525">The question crudely put to shun delay ,</l>
      <l n="526">‘ Twas carried by the major part to stay .</l>
      <l n="527">His point thus gained , Sir Martin dated thence</l>
      <l n="528">His power , and from a priest became a prince .</l>
      <l n="529">He ordered all things with a busy care , }</l>

      <l n="531">And large provisions laid of winter fare ;}</l>
      <l n="532">But , now and then , let fall a word or two , }</l>
      <l n="533">Of hope , that heaven some miracle might show , }</l>

      <l n="535">Against the laws of nature upward climb ,</l>
      <l n="536">And , mounted on the Ram , renew the prime ;</l>
      <l n="537">For which two proofs in sacred story lay ,</l>

      <l n="2">And mother Hubbard , in her homely dress ,</l>
      <l n="3">Has sharply blamed a British Lioness ;</l>
      <l n="4">That queen , whose feast the factious rabble keep ,</l>
      <l n="5">Exposed obscenely naked , and asleep .— P . 197 .</l>
     </lg>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The poet , in the beginning of this canto , anticipates the censure of those who might blame him for introducing into his fables animals not natives of Britain , where the scene was laid . He vindicates himself by the example of Æsop and Spenser . The latter , in “ Mother Hubbard 's Tale , ” exhibits at length the various arts by which , in his time , obscure and infamous characters rose to eminence in church and state . This is illustrated by the parable of an Ape and a Fox , who insinuate themselves into various situations , and play the knaves in all . At length ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Lo , where they spied , how , in a gloomy glade ,</l>
     <l n="2">The Lion , sleeping , lay in secret shade ;</l>
     <l n="3">His crown and sceptre lying him beside ,</l>
     <l n="4">And having doft for heat his dreadful hide .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The adventurers possess themselves of the royal spoils , with which the Ape is arrayed ; who forthwith takes upon himself the dignity of the monarch of the beasts , and , by the counsels of the Fox , commits every species of oppression , until Jove , incensed at the disorders which his tyranny had introduced , sends Mercury to awaken the Lion from his slumber :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Arise ! said Mercury , thou sluggish beast ,</l>
     <l n="2">That here liest senseless , like the corpse deceast ;</l>
     <l n="3">The whilst thy kingdom from thy head is rent ,</l>
     <l n="4">And thy throne royal with dishonour blent .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The Lion rouses himself , hastens to court , and avenges himself of the usurpers .— There is no doubt , that , under this allegory , Spenser meant to represent the exorbitant power of Lord Burleigh ; and he afterwards complains , that his verse occasioned his falling into a “ mighty peer 's displeasure . ” The Lion , therefore , whose negligence is upbraided by Mercury , was Queen Elizabeth . Dryden calls her ,</p>
   <p>The queen , whose feast the factious rabble keep ;</p>
   <p>because the tumultuous pope-burnings of 1680 and 1681 were solemnized on Queen Elizabeth 's night . The poet had probably , since his change of religion , laid aside much of the hereditary respect with which most Englishmen regard Queen Bess ; for , in the pamphlets of the Romanists , she is branded as “ a known bastard , who raised this prelatic protestancy , called the church of England , as a prop to supply the weakness of her title . "[ 264 ]</p>
   <p>Spenser 's authority is only appealed to by Dryden as justifying the introduction of lions and other foreign animals into a British fable . But I observed in the introduction , that it also furnishes authority , at least example , for those aberrations from the character and attributes of his brute actors , with which the critics taxed Dryden ; for nothing in “ The Hind and the Panther ” can be more inconsistent with the natural quality of such animals , than the circumstance of a lion , or any other creature , going to sleep without his skin , on account of the sultry weather .</p>

   <p>The memorable judgment and decree of the university of Oxford , passed in the Convocation 21st July , 1683 , condemns , as heretical , all works which teach or infer the lawfulness of resistance to lawful governors , even when they become tyrants , or in case of persecution for religion , or infringement on the laws of the country , or , in short , in any case whatever ; and after the various authorities for these and other tenets have been given and denounced as false , seditious , heretical , and impious , the decree concludes with the following injunctions :</p>
   <p>“ Lastly , we command and strictly enjoin all and singular readers , tutors , catechists , and others , to whom the care and trust of institution of youth is committed , that they diligently instruct and ground their scholars in that most necessary doctrine , which in a manner is the badge and character of the church of England , of submitting to every ordinance of man for the Lord 's sake , whether it be to the king as supreme , or unto governors , as unto them that are sent by him , for the punishment of evil doers , and for the praise of them that do well : Teaching , that this submission and obedience is to be clear , absolute , and without exception of any state or order of men . ”</p>

   </lg>
   <p>During the latter years of the reign of Charles the Second , the dissensions of the state began to creep into the church . By far the greater part of the clergy , influenced by the ancient union of church and king , were steady in their adherence to the court interest . But a party began to appear , who were distinguished from their brethren by the name of Moderate Divines , which they assumed to themselves , and by that of Latitudinarians , which the high churchmen conferred upon them . The chief amongst these were Tillotson , Stillingfleet , and Burnet . They distinguished themselves by a less violent ardour for the ceremonies , and even the government , of the church ; for all those particulars , in short , by which she is distinguished from other Protestant congregations . Stillingfleet carried these condescensions so far , as to admit in his tract , called Irenicum , that , although the original church was settled in a constitution of bishops , priests , and deacons , yet as the apostles made no positive law upon this subject , it remained free to every Christian congregation to alter or to retain that form of church government . In conformity with this opinion , he , in conjunction with Tillotson and others , laid a plan for an accommodation with the Presbyterians , in 1668 ; and , in order to this comprehension , he was willing to have made such sacrifices in the point of ordination , &amp; c. that the House of Commons took the alarm , and passed a vote , prohibiting even the introduction of a bill for such a purpose . As , on the one hand , the tenets of the moderate clergy approximated those of the Calvinists ; so , on the other , their antipathy and opposition to the church of Rome was more deeply rooted , in proportion to the slighter value which they attached to the particulars in which that of England resembled her . It flowed naturally from this indulgence to the Dissenters , and detestation of the Romanists , that several of the moderate clergy participated deeply in the terrors excited by the Roman Catholic plot , and looked with a favourable eye on the bill which proposed to exclude the Duke of York from the throne as a professor of that obnoxious religion . Being thus , as it were , an opposition party , it cannot be supposed that the low church divines united cordially with their high-flying brethren in renouncing the right of resisting oppression , or in professing passive obedience to the royal will . They were of opinion , that there was a mutual compact between the king and subject , and that acts of tyranny , on the part of the former , absolved the latter from his allegiance . This was particularly inculcated by the reverend Samuel Johnson ( See Vol . IX . p . 369 . ) in “ Julian the Apostate , ” and other writings which were condemned by the Oxford decree . As the dangers attending the church , from the measures of King James , became more obvious , and the alternative of resistance or destruction became an approaching crisis , the low church party acquired numbers and strength from those who thought it better at once to hold and assert the lawfulness of opposition to tyranny , than to make professions of obedience beyond the power of human endurance to make good .</p>
   <p>This party was of course deeply hated by the Catholics , and hence the severity with which they are treated by Dryden , who objects to them as the illegitimate offspring of the Panther by the Wolf , and traces to their Presbyterian origin their indifference to the fasts and ascetic observances of the more rigid high-churchmen , and their covert disposition to resist regal domination . Their adherence to the English communion he ascribes only to the lucre of gain , and endeavours , if possible , to draw an odious distinction between them and the rest of the church . Stillingfleet , whom this motive could not escape , had already complained of Dryden 's designing any particular class of the clergy by a party name . “ From the common people , we come to churchmen , to see how he uses them . And he hath soon found out a faction among them , whom he charges with juggling designs : but romantic heroes must be allowed to make armies of a field of thistles , and to encounter windmills for giants . He would fain be the instrument to divide our clergy , and to fill them with suspicions of one another . And to this end he talks of men of latitudinarian stamp : for it goes a great way towards the making divisions , to be able to fasten a name of distinction among brethren ; this being to create jealousies of each other . But there is nothing should make them more careful to avoid such names of distinction , than to observe how ready their common enemies are to make use of them , to create animosities by them ; which hath made this worthy gentleman to start this different character of churchmen among us ; as though there were any who were not true to the principles of the church of England , as by law established : If he knows them , he is better acquainted with them than the answerer is ; for he professes to know none such . But who then are these men of the latitudinarian stamp ? To speak in his own language , they are a sort of ergoteerers , who are for a concedo rather than a nego . And now , I hope , they are all well explained ; or , in other words of his , they are , saith he , for drawing the nonconformists to their party , i. e . they are for having no nonconformists . And is this their crime ? But they would take the headship of the church out of the king 's hands : How is that possible ? They would ( by his own description ) be glad to see differences lessened , and all that agree in the same doctrine to be one entire body . But this is that which their enemies fear , and this politician hath too much discovered ; for then such a party would be wanting , which might be played upon the church of England , or be brought to join with others against it . But how this should touch the king 's supremacy , I cannot imagine . As for his desiring loyal subjects to consider this matter , I hope they will , and the more for his desiring it ; and assure themselves , that they have no cause to apprehend any juggling designs of their brethren ; who , I hope , will always show themselves to be loyal subjects , and dutiful sons of the church of England . ” — Vindication of the Answer to some late Papers , p. 104 .</p>

   <p>The Huguenot clergy , who took refuge in England after the recal of the edict of Nantes , did not all adhere to the same Protestant communion . There had been long in London what was called the Walloon church , exclusively dedicated to this sort of worship . Many conformed to the church of England ; and , having submitted to new ordination , some of them obtained benefices : others joined in communion with the Presbyterians , and dissenters of various kinds . Dryden insinuates , that had the church of England presented vacancies sufficient for the provision of these foreign divines , she would probably have had the honour of attracting them all within her pale . The reformed clergy of France were far from being at any time an united body . “ It might have been expected , ” says Burnet , “ that those unhappy contests between Lutherans , Calvinists , Arminians , and Anti-Arminians , with some minuter disputes that have enflamed Geneva and Switzerland , should have been at least suspended while they had a common enemy to deal with , against whom their whole force united was scarce able to stand . But these things were carried on rather with more eagerness and sharpness than ever . ” History of his Own Times , Book IV .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>The three steeples argent obviously alludes to the pluralities enjoyed , perhaps by Stillingfleet , and certainly by some of the divines of the established church , who were not on that account less eager in opposing the intrusion of the Roman clergy , and stigmatising those who , at this crisis , thought proper to conform to the royal faith . These converts were neither numerous nor respectable ; and , whatever the Hind is pleased to allege in the text , posterity cannot but suspect the disinterestedness of their motives . Obadiah Walker , and a very few of the university of Oxford , embraced the Catholic faith , conforming at the same time to the forms of the church of England , as if they wished to fulfil the old saying , of having two strings to one bow .— The Earls of Perth and Melfort , with one or two other Scottish nobles , took the same step . Of the first , who must otherwise have failed in a contest which he had with the Duke of Queensberry , it was wittily said by Halifax , that “ his faith had made him whole . ” And , in general , as my countrymen are not usually credited by their brethren of England for an extreme disregard to their own interest , the Scottish converts were supposed to be peculiarly attracted to Rome by the miracle of the loaves and fishes .<span corresp="#note265" type="note_anchor">[ 265 ]</span>But it may be said for these unfortunate peers , that if they were dazzled by the momentary sunshine which gleamed on the Catholic church , they scorned to desert her in the tempest which speedily succeeded . Whereas , we shall do a kindness to Lord Sunderland , if we suppose that he became a convert to Popery , merely from views of immediate interest , and not with the premeditated intention of blinding and betraying the monarch , who trusted him . Dryden must be supposed , however , chiefly interested in the vindication of his own motives for a change of religion .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Dryden here puts into the mouth of the Panther some of the severe language which Stillingfleet had held towards him in the ardour of controversy . He had , in direct allusion to our author , ( for he quotes his poetry ,) expressed himself thus harshly :</p>
   <p>“ If I thought there were no such thing in the world as true religion , and that the priests of all religions are alike ,<span corresp="#note266" type="note_anchor">[ 266 ]</span>I might have been as nimble a convert , and as early a defender of the royal papers , as any one of these champions . For why should not one who believes no religion , declare for any ? But since I do verily believe , that not only there is such a thing as true religion , but that it is only to be found in the books of the Holy Scripture , I have reason to inquire after the best means of understanding such books , and thereby , if it may be , to put an end to the controversies of Christendom . "[ 267 ]</p>
   <p>“ But our grim logician proceeds from immediate and original to concomitant causes , which he saith were revenge , ambition , and covetousness . But the skill of logicians used to lie in proving ; but this is not our author 's talent , for not a word is produced to that purpose . If bold sayings , and confident declarations , will do the business , he is never unprovided ; but if you expect any reason from him , he begs your pardon . He finds how ill the character of a grim logician suits with his inclination . "[ 268 ] Again , “ But if I will not allow his affirmations for proofs for his part , he will act the grim logician ; no , and in truth it becomes him so ill , that he doth well to give it over . "[ 269 ] And in the beginning of his “ Vindication , ” alluding to a term used by the defender of the king 's papers , Stillingfleet says : “ But lest I be again thought to have a mind to flourish before I offer to pass , as the champion speaks in his proper language , I shall apply myself to the matter before us .

   </lg>
   <p>“ And now this gentleman sets himself to ergoteering ;<span corresp="#note271" type="note_anchor">[ 271 ]</span>and looks and talks like any grim logician , of the causes which produced it , and the effects which it produced . ‘ The schism led the way to the Reformation , for breaking the unity of Christ 's church , which was the foundation of it : but the immediate cause of this , which produced the separation of Henry VIII . from the church of Rome , was the refusal of the pope to grant him a divorce from his first wife , and to gratify his desires in a dispensation for a second marriage . ’</p>
   <p>“ Ergo : The first cause of the Reformation , was the satisfying an inordinate and brutal passion . But is he sure of this ? If he be not , it is a horrible calumny upon our church , upon King Henry the Eighth , and the whole nation , as I shall presently show . No ; he confesses he cannot be sure of it : for , saith he , no man can carry it so high as the original cause with any certainty . And at the same time , he undertakes to demonstrate the immediate cause to be Henry the Eighth 's inordinate and brutal passion ; and afterwards affirms , as confidently as if he had demonstrated it , that our Reformation was erected on the foundations of lust , sacrilege , and usurpation : Yet , saith he , the king only knew whether it was conscience or love , or love alone , which moved him to sue for a divorce . Then , by his favour , the king only could know what was the immediate cause of that which he calls the schism . Well ! but he offers at some probabilities , that lust was the true cause . Is Ergoteering come to this already ? ‘ But this we may say , if Conscience had any part in it , she had taken a long nap of almost twenty years together before she awakened . ’ Doth he think , that Conscience doth not take a longer nap than this in some men , and yet they pretend to have it truly awakened at last ? What thinks he of late converts ? Cannot they be true , because conscience hath slept so long in them ? Must we conclude in such cases , that some inordinate passion gives conscience a jog at last ? ‘ So that it cannot be denied , he saith , that an inordinate and brutal passion had a great share at least in the production of the schism . ’ How ! cannot be denied ! I say from his own words it ought to be denied , for he confesses none could know but the king himself ; he never pretended that the king confessed it : How then cannot it be denied ? Yea , how dare any one affirm it ? Especially when the king himself declared in a solemn assembly , in these words , saith Hall , ( as near , saith he , as I could carry them away ,) speaking of the dissatisfaction of his conscience ,— “ For this only cause , I protest before God , and in the word of a prince , I have asked counsel of the greatest clerks in Christendom ; and for this cause I have sent for this legat , as a man indifferent , only to know the truth , and to settle my conscience , and for none other cause , as God can judge . ” And both then and afterwards , he declared , that his scruples began upon the French ambassador 's making a question about the legitimacy of the marriage , when the match was proposed between the Duke of Orleans and his daughter ; and he affirms , that he moved it himself in confession to the Bishop of Lincoln , and appeals to him concerning the truth of it in open court . ” — Vindication of the Answer to some late Papers , p. 109 .</p>

   <p>Stillingfleet concludes his “ Vindication ” with this admonition to Dryden : “ I would desire him not to end with such a bare-faced assertion of a thing so well known to be false , viz . that there is not one original treatise written by a Protestant , which hath handled distinctly , and by itself , that Christian virtue of humility . Since within a few years ( besides what hath been printed formerly ) such a book hath been published in London . But he doth well to bring it off with , ‘ at least that I have seen or heard of ; ’ for such books have not lain much in the way of his inquiries . Suppose we had not such particular books , we think the Holy Scripture gives the best rules and examples of humility of any book in the world ; but I am afraid he should look on his case as desperate if I send him to the Scripture , since he saith , ‘ Our divines do that as physicians do with their patients whom they think uncurable , send them at last to Tunbridge-waters , or to the air of Montpellier . ”</p>
   <p>Dryden , in the Introduction , says , that the author of this work was called Duncombe ; but he is charged with inaccuracy by Montague , who says his name is Allen . It seems to be admitted , that his work is a translation from the Spanish . The real author may have been Thomas Allen , rector of Kettering , in Northamptonshire , and author of “ The Practice of a Holy Life , 8vo . 1716 ; ” in the list of books subjoined to which , I find “ The Virtue of Humility , recommended to be printed by the late reverend and learned Dr Henry Hammond , ” which perhaps may be the book in question . A sort of similarity of sound between Duncombe and Hammond may have led to Dryden 's mistake . Alonzo Rodriguez , of the Order of the Jesuits , wrote a book called “ Exercicio de perfecion y virtudes Christianas , Sevilla , 1609 , ” which seems to be the work from which the plagiary was taken .</p>

   <p>Our author , in the preceding lines , had employed himself in repelling the charge of his having changed his religion for the sake of interest . His loaves , he says , had not been increased by the change , nor had his assiduity at court intimated any claim upon royal favour : and in reference to her neglect of literary merit , he charges on the church of England the fate of Butler , a brother poet . Of that truly original genius we only know , that his life was spent in dependence , and embittered by disappointment . But unless Dryden alludes to some incident now unknown , it is difficult to see how the church of England could have rewarded his merit . Undoubtedly she owed much to his forcible satire against her lately triumphant rivals , the Presbyterians and Independents ; but , unless Butler had been in orders , how could the church have recompensed his poetical talents ? The author of the most witty poem that ever was written had a much more natural and immediate claim upon the munificence of the wittiest king and court that ever was in England ; nor was his satire less serviceable to royalty than to the established religion . The blame of neglecting Butler lay therefore on Charles II . and his gay courtiers , who quoted “ Hudibras ” incessantly , and left the author to struggle with obscurity and indigence . The poet himself has , in a fragment called “ Hudibras at Court , ” set forth both the kind reception which Charles gave the poem , and his neglect of the author :</p>

   <p>Our author here complains of the personal reflections which Stillingfleet had cast upon him , particularly in the passage already quoted in Note VII ., where he is expressly charged with disbelieving the existence of “ such a thing as true religion . ” The second and third lines of the triplet are somewhat obscure . The meaning seems to be , that Dryden , conscious of having given the first offence , which we shall presently see was the case , justifies his having done so , from personal abuse being the never-failing resort of the liberal clergy . The application of the neuter pronoun it to the liberal clergy , is probably in imitation of Virgil 's satirical construction :</p>
   <p>Varium et mutabile semper fæmina .</p>
   <p>It happened in this controversy , as in most others , that both parties , laying out of consideration the provocation which they themselves had given , complained bitterly of the illiberality of their antagonists . Stillingfleet expatiates on the unhandsome language contained in Dryden 's Defence , and the passages which he quotes are those which contain the exposure of the liberal clergy mentioned in the text :</p>
   <p>“ Yet as if I had been the sole contriver or inventor of all , he bestows those civil and obliging epithets upon me , of disingenuous , foul-mouthed , and shuffling ; one of a virulent genius , of spiteful diligence , and irreverence to the royal family ; of subtle calumny , and sly aspersion ; and he adds to these ornaments of speech , that I have a cloven-foot , and my name is Legion ; and that my Answer is an infamous libel , a scurrilous saucy pamphlet . Is this indeed the spirit of a new convert ? Is this the meekness and temper you intend to gain proselytes by , and to convert the nation ? He tells us in the beginning , that truth has a language peculiar to itself : I desire to be informed , whether these be any of the characters of it ? And how the language of reproach and evil-speaking may be distinguished from it ? But zeal in a new convert is a terrible thing ; for it not only burns , but rages , like the eruptions of Mount Ætna ; it fills the air with noise and smoke , and throws out such a torrent of liquid fire , that there is no standing before it . The Answer alone was too mean a sacrifice for such a Hector in controversy . All that standeth in his way must fall at his feet . He calls me Legion , that he may be sure to have number enough to overcome . But he is a great proficient indeed , if he be such an exorcist , to cast out a whole legion already . But he hopes it may be done without fasting and prayer . ” — Vindication of the Answer , p. 1 .</p>

   <p>The Hind having shewn that her influence over Dryden was such as to induce him to submit patiently , and without vengeance , to injury and reproach , now calls upon the Panther to exert her authority in turn over Stillingfleet , for his irreverend attack upon the royal papers in favour of the Catholic religion . Upon a careful perusal of the Answers and Vindication of that great divine , it is impossible to find any grounds for the charge of his having reviled Charles II . or the Duchess of York ; on the contrary , their names are always mentioned with great respect , and the controversy is conducted strictly in conformity with the following spirited advertisement prefixed to the Answer :</p>
   <p>“ If the papers , here answered , had not been so publicly dispersed through the nation , a due respect to the name they bear , would have kept the author from publishing any answer to them . But because they may now fall into many hands , who , without some assistance , may not readily resolve some difficulties started by them , he thought it not unbecoming his duty to God and the king , to give a clearer light to the things contained in them . And it can be no reflection on the authority of a prince , for a private subject to examine a piece of coin as to its just value , though it bears his image and superscription upon it . In matters that concern faith and salvation , we must prove all things , and hold fast that which is good . ” — Advertisement to Answer to the Royal Papers .</p>
   <p>Dryden , however , like the other Catholics , was pleased to interpret the impugning and confuting the arguments used by the king and duchess , into contempt and disrespect for their persons . It was this forced construction on which was founded the prosecution of Sharpe and of the Bishop of London before the ecclesiastical commissioners . Sharpe having been defied to a polemical contest , by a paper handed into his pulpit , took occasion to preach on the arguments contained in it ; and mentioned , with some contempt , persons who could be influenced by such weak reasoning . This was interpreted as a reflection on the new converts , and particularly on the king himself ; and a mandate was issued to the Bishop of London , commanding that the obnoxious preacher should be suspended . The issue of this matter has been noticed in the notes on “ Absalom and Achitophel , ” Vol . IX . p. 302 .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Dryden here triumphs in the conquest he pretends to have gained over Stillingfleet . In the beginning of the controversy , the Dean of St Paul 's had spoken dubiously of the authenticity of the paper ascribed to the Duchess . In his Vindication , he fully admitted that point , and insisted only upon the weakness of the reasons which she alleged for her conversion . This Dryden compares to a defeated vessel , bearing away under the smoke of her last broadside .</p>
   <p>The person , whom he states to have counselled Stillingfleet , is probably Burnet ; and the score which he paid , is the severe description given of him under the character of the Buzzard . Dryden always seems to have viewed the Answer to the Royal Papers as the work of more than one hand . In his “ Defence , ” he affirms , that the answerer 's “ name is Legion ; but though the body be possessed with many evil spirits , it is but one of them that talks . ” In the introduction to the “ Hind and Panther , ” he says , he is informed both of the “ author and supervisors of this pamphlet . ” He conjectured , as was probably the truth , that a controversy of such importance , and which required to be managed with such peculiar delicacy , was not entrusted to a single individual . Besides Burnet , it is probable that Tillotson , Tennison , and Patrick , all of whom mingled in the polemical disputes of that period , were consulted by Stillingfleet on this important occasion .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>The general application of the fable of the Swallows to the short gleam of Catholic prosperity during the reign of James II . is sufficiently manifest . But it is probable , that a more close and intimate allusion was intended to an event which took place in 1686 , when the whole nation was in confusion at the measures of King James , so that the alarm had extended even to the Catholics , who were the objects of his favour . We are told , there was a general meeting of the leading Roman Catholics at the Savoy , to consult how this favourable crisis might be most improved to the advantage of their cause . Father Petre had the chair ; and at the very opening of the debates , it appeared , that the majority were more inclined to provide for their own security , than to come to extremities with the Protestants . Notwithstanding the King 's zeal , power , and success , they were afraid to push the experiment any farther . The people were already alarmed , the soldiers could not be depended upon , the very courtiers melted out of their grasp . All depended on a single life , which was already on the decline ; and if that life should last yet a few years longer , and continue as hitherto devoted to their interest and service , they foresaw innumerable difficulties in their way , and anticipated disappointments without end . Upon these considerations , therefore , some were for a petition to the king , that he would only so far interpose in their favour , that their estates might be secured to them by act of parliament , with exemption from all employments , and liberty to worship God in their own way , in their own houses . Others were for obtaining the king 's leave to sell their estates , and transport themselves and their effects to France . All but Father Petre were for a compromise of some sort or other ; but he disdained whatever had a tendency to moderation , and was for making the most of the voyage while the sea was smooth , and the wind prosperous . All these several opinions , we are farther told , were laid before the king , who was pleased to answer , “ That before their desires were made known to him , he had provided a sure retreat and sanctuary for them in Ireland , in case all those endeavours which he was making for their security in England should be blasted , and which as yet gave him no reason to despair . "[ 272 ]</p>
   <p>It will hardly , I think , be disputed , that the fable of the Swallows about to cross the seas refers to this consultation of the Catholics ; and it is a strong instance of Dryden 's prejudice against priests of all persuasions , that , in the character of the Martin , who persuaded the Swallows to postpone the flight , he decidedly appears to have designed Petre , the king 's confessor and prime adviser in state matters , both spiritual and temporal . The name of Martin may contain an allusion to the parish of St Martin 's , in which Whitehall , and the royal chapel , are situated . But should this be thought fanciful , it is certain , that the portrait of this vain , presumptuous , ambitious , bigotted Jesuit , who was in keen pursuit of a cardinal 's cap , is exactly that of the Martin :</p>

   </lg>
   <p>It may be doubted , whether the reverend father was highly pleased with this sarcastic description , or whether he admitted readily the apology , that the poet , speaking in the character of the heretical church , was obliged to use Protestant colouring .</p>
   <p>The close correspondence of the fable with the real events may be farther traced , and admit of yet more minute illustration :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The Raven , from the withered oak ,</l>
     <l n="2">Left of their lodging ,——</l>
   </lg>
   <p>may be conjectured to mean Tennison , within whose parish Whitehall was situated , and who stood in the front of battle during all the Roman Catholic controversy . As Petre is the Martin who persuaded the Catholics not to leave the kingdom , his preparations for maintaining their ground there are also noticed :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">He ordered all things with a busy care ,</l>
     <l n="2">And cells and refectories did prepare ,</l>
     <l n="3">And large provisions laid of winter fare .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>This alludes to the numerous schools and religious establishments which the Jesuits prepared to establish throughout England .<span corresp="#note274" type="note_anchor">[ 274 ]</span>The chapel which housed them is obviously the royal chapel , where the priests were privileged to exercise their functions even during the subsistence of the penal laws . The transient gleam of sunshine which invited the Swallows forth from their retirement , is the Declaration of Indulgence , in consequence of which the Catholics assumed the open and general exercise of their religion . The Irish Catholics , with the sanguine Talbot at their head , may be the first who hailed the imaginary return of spring : they are painted as</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">—— Swifts , the giants of the Swallow kind ,</l>
     <l n="2">Large limbed , stout hearted , but of stupid mind .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I cannot help thinking , that our author , still speaking in the character of the English church , describes himself as the “ foolish Cuckow , ” whose premature annunciation of spring completed the Swallow 's delusion . Perhaps he intended to mitigate the scornful description of Petre , by talking of himself also as a Protestant would have talked of him . The foreign priests and Catholic officers , whom hopes of promotion now brought into England , are pointed out by the “ foreign fowl , ” who came in flocks ,</p>
   <p>To bless the founder , and partake the cheer .</p>
   <p>The fable concludes in a prophetic strain , by indicating the calamities which were likely to overwhelm the Catholics , as soon as the death of James , or any similar event , should end their temporary prosperity . It is well known , how exactly the event corresponded to the prophecy ; even the circumstance of the rabble rising upon the Catholic priests was most literally verified . In most of the sea-port towns , they watched the coasts to prevent their escape ; and when King James was taken at Feversham , the fishermen , by whom he was seized , were employed in what they called by the cant phrase of “ priest-codding , ” that is , lying in wait for the fugitive priests .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>The conclusion of the fable naturally introduces a discussion of the penal laws , which unquestionably were extremely severe towards Catholics . By the fourteenth of Queen Elizabeth , it was enacted , that whoever , by bulls of the pope , should reconcile any one to Rome , should , together with the person reconciled , be guilty of high treason ; that those , who relieved such reconcilers , should be liable in the penalties of a premunire , and those who concealed them in misprision of treason . A still more severe law passed in the twenty-eighth of the same queen , upon discovery of Parry 's conspiracy against her life , to which he had been stirred up by a book of Allen , or Parsons the Jesuit , written for the express purpose . It was thereby enacted , that all Jesuits and Popish priests should depart the kingdom within forty days ; and that those who should afterwards return into the kingdom , should be guilty of high treason ; and all who relieved and maintained them , of felony . There were other enactments of a similar nature made upon the discovery of the gun-powder plot . Samuel Johnson ( I mean the divine ) gives an odd justification of these laws , saying , that the priests are hanged , not as priests , but as traitors . But , as their being priests was the sole reason for their being held traitors , it does not appear , that the Protestant divine can avail himself of this distinction .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>The fanatic author is John White , commonly called Century White . He was born in Pembrokeshire in 1590 , was educated for the bar , and made a considerable figure in his profession . As he was a rigid puritan , he was chosen one of the trustees which that sect appointed to purchase impropriations to be bestowed upon fanatic preachers . This design was checked by Archbishop Laud ; and White , among others , received a severe censure in the Star-Chamber . In the Long Parliament , White was member for Southwark , and distinguished himself by his vindictive severity against the bishops and Episcopal clergy , saying openly in a committee , he hoped to live to see the day , when there should be neither bishop nor cathedral priest in England . He was very active in the ejectment of the clergy , by which upwards of eight thousand churchmen are said to have lost their cures in the course of four or five years . In order to encourage and justify these violent measures , he published his famous treatise , entitled , “ The First Century of Scandalous Malignant Priests , made and admitted into benefices by the Prelates , London , 1643 ; ” a tract which contains , as may be inferred from its name , an hundred instances of unworthiness , which had been either proved to have existed among the clergy of the church of England , or had been invented to throw a slander upon them . When this satire was shown to Charles I ., it was proposed to answer it by a similar exposition of the scandalous part of the puritanical teachers ; but that monarch would not consent to give countenance to a warfare in which neither party could gain , and religion was sure to be a loser between them . Similar considerations are said to have prevented White himself from publishing “ A Second Century , ” in continuation of his work . He wrote another tract , entitled , “ The Looking Glass ; ” in which he attempted to prove , that the sin against the Holy Ghost was the bearing arms for the king in the civil war . His own party bestow on White a high character for religion and virtue ; but the cavaliers alleged , that although he had two wives of his own , a large proportion of matrimony , he did not forbear to visit three belonging to his neighbours in the White Friars . He died in January 1644 , and is said , in his last illness , to have bitterly lamented the active share which he had taken in ejecting so many guiltless ministers , and their families . This , however , may be a fiction of the royalists ; for the death-bed repentance of an enemy is amongst the most common forgeries of party . White 's body was attended to the grave by most of the members of Parliament , and the following distich inscribed on his tomb :</p>

   </lg>
   <p>When James II . ascended the throne , deceived by the general attachment of the church of England for his person , and the little jealousy which they seemed to entertain of his religion , he conceived there would be no great difficulty in procuring a reconciliation between the national church and that of Rome . With this view he made a favourable declaration of his intentions to maintain the church of England as by law established , and certainly expected , that , in return , they would consent to the repeal of the test act and penal laws ;<span corresp="#note275" type="note_anchor">[ 275 ]</span>and this , it was conceived , might pave the way for uniting the churches . An extraordinary pamphlet , already quoted , recommends such an union , founded upon the mutual attachment of both communions to King James , upon their success in resisting the Bill of Exclusion , and their common hatred of the dissenters . “ This very stone , which was once rejected by the architects , is now become the chief stone in the corner . We may truly see in it the hand of God , and look upon it with admiration ; and may expect , if fears and jealousies hinder not , the greatest blessings we can wish for . An union betwixt these two walls , which have been thus long separated , and now in a fair way to be united and linked together by this corner stone ; after which , how glorious a structure may we hope for on such foundations ! ” A plan is therefore laid down , containing the following heads , of which it may be observed , that the very first is the abrogation of these penal laws , which Dryden states to be the principal bar between the alliance of the Hind and the Panther .</p>
   <p>“ First , that it may be provided , That those who are known to be faithful friends to the king and kingdom 's good , may equally with us enjoy those favours and blessings we may hope for under so great and so just a king , without being liable to the sanguinary penal laws , for holding opinions noways inconsistent with loyalty , and the peace and quiet of the nation ; and that they may not be obliged , by oaths and tests , either to renounce their religion , which they know they cannot do without sacrilege , or else to put themselves out of capacity of serving their king and country .</p>
   <p>“ Secondly , That , for healing our differences , it be appointed , that neither side , in their sermons , touch upon matters of controversy with animating reflections ; but that those discourses may wholly tend to peace and piety , religion and sound morality ; and that , in all public catechisms , the solid grounds and principles of religion may be solely explicated and established , all reflecting animosities being laid aside .</p>
   <p>“ Thirdly , That some learned , devout , and sober persons , may be made choice of on both sides , who may truly state matters of controversy betwixt us ; to the end , each one may know others pretensions , and the tenets they cannot abandon , without breaking the chain of apostolic faith ; which , if it be done , we shall , it may be , find that to be true , which the Papists often tell us , that the difference betwixt them and us is not so great as many make it ; nor their tenets so pernicious , but if we saw them naked , we should , if not embrace them as truths , yet not condemn them as errors , much less as pernicious doctrines . Yet if , notwithstanding all this , we cannot perfectly agree in some points , let us , however , endeavour to live together in the bonds of love and charity , as becomes good Christians and loyal subjects , and join together to oppugn those known maxims , and pernicious errors , which destroy the essence of religion , loyalty , and good government . ” — Remonstrance , by way of Address , to the Church of England , 1685 .</p>

   <p>The Test-act was passed in the year 1678 , while the popish plot was in its vigour , and the Earl of Shaftesbury was urging every point against the Catholics , with his eyes uniformly fixed upon the Bill of Exclusion as his crowning measure . It imposed on all who should sit in parliament , a declaration of their abhorrence of the doctrine of transubstantiation . The Duke of York , with tears in his eyes , moved for a proviso to exempt himself , protesting , that he cast himself upon the House in the greatest concern he could have in the world ; and that whatever his religion might be , it should only be a private thing between God and his own soul . Notwithstanding this pathetic appeal , he carried his point but by two votes . With seven other peers he protested against the bill . Dryden therefore , and probably with great justice , represents this test as a part of his machinations against the Duke of York , whose party was at that time , and afterwards , warmly espoused by the church of England . But though the Test-act was devised by a statesman whom they hated , and carried by a party whom they had opposed , the high-church clergy were not the less unwilling to part with it when they found the advantages which it gave them against the Papists in King James 's reign . Hence they were loaded with the following reproaches : “ My business is to set forth , in its own colours , the extraordinary loyalty of those men , who obstinately maintain a test contrived by the faction to usher in the Bill of Exclusion : And it is much admired , even by some of her own children , that the grave and matron-like church of England , which values herself so much for her antiquity , should be over-fond of a new point of faith , lately broached by a famous act of an infallible parliament , convened at Westminster , and guided by the holy spirit of Shaftesbury . But I doubt there are some parliaments in the world which will not so easily admit this new article into their creed , though the church of England labours so much to maintain it as a special evidence of her singular loyalty . ” — New Test of the Church of England 's Loyalty .</p>

   <p>This passage regards the situation of the Roman Catholic peers . Notwithstanding their religion , they had been allowed to retain their seats and votes in the House of Lords . So jealous were they , ( as was but natural ,) of this privilege , that , in 1675 , when Danby proposed a test oath upon all holding state employments and benefices , the object of which was to acknowledge the doctrine of non-resistance , and disown all attempts at an alteration of government , the Roman Catholic peers , to the number of twenty , who had hitherto always voted with the crown , united , on this occasion , with the opposition , and occasioned the loss of the bill . This North imputes to the art of Shaftesbury , who dinned into their ears , “ that this test ( by mentioning the maintenance of the Protestant religion , though that of the royal authority was chiefly proposed ) tended to deprive them of their right of voting , which was a birth-right so sacrosanct and radically inherent in the peerage , as not to be temerated on any account whatsoever . ” When the earl had heated the Catholic lords with this suggestion , he secured them to the opposition , by proposing , and carrying through , an order of the House , that no bill should be received , tending to deprive any of the peerage of their right . But when the Test-act of 1678 was moved , which had , for its direct purpose , that exclusion which that of 1675 was supposed only to convey by implication , Shaftesbury laughed at the order which he himself had proposed , saying , leges posteriores priores abrogant . And by this test , which required the renunciation of their religion as idolatrous , the Catholic peerage were effectually , and for ever , excluded from their seats in the House of Lords . Dryden intimates , in the following lines , that this test applied to the Papists alone , and complains heavily of this odious distinction , betwixt them and other non-conformists .</p>

   <p>James II . and the established church set out on the highest terms of good humour with each other . This , as the king afterwards assured the dissenters , was owing to the professions made to him by some of the churchmen , whom he named , who had promised favour to the Catholics , provided he would abandon all idea of general toleration , and leave them their ancient authority over the fanatics . Moved , as he said , by these promises , the Declaration in council , issued upon his accession , had this remarkable clause : “ I know the principles of the church of England are for monarchy , and the members of it have shewn themselves good and loyal subjects , therefore I shall always take care to defend and support it . ” This explicit declaration gave the greatest satisfaction to the kingdom in general , and particularly to the clergy . “ All the pulpits of England , ” says Burnet , “ were full of it , and of thanksgivings for it . It was magnified as a security far greater than any that laws could give . The common phrase was , We have now the word of a king , and a word never yet broken . This general feeling of gratitude led to a set of addresses , full of the most extravagant expressions of loyalty and fidelity to so gracious a sovereign . The churchmen led the way in these expressions of zeal ; and the university of Oxford , in particular , promised to obey the king without limitations or restrictions . ” The king 's promise was reckoned so solemn and inviolable , that those addresses were censured as guilty at least of ill-breeding , who mentioned in their papers the “ religion established by law ; ” since that expression implied an obligation on the king to maintain it , independently of his royal grace and favour . But the scene speedily changed , as the king 's intentions began to disclose themselves . Then , as a Catholic pamphleteer expresses himself , “ My loyal gentlemen were so far out of the right bias , that , in lieu of taking off the tests and penal laws , which all people expected from them in point of gratitude and good manners , they made a solemn address to his majesty , that none be employed who were not capacitated by the said laws and tests to bear offices civil and military . "[ 276 ]</p>
   <p>If James , had viewed with attention the incidents of the former reign , he might have recollected , that , however devoted the clergy had then shown themselves to the crown , his brother 's attempt at his present measure of a general indulgence had at once alarmed the whole church . This sensibility , when the interest of the church is concerned , is severely contrasted with the general indifference to the cause of freedom , into which they relapsed when the indulgence was recalled , in a party pamphlet of the year 1680-1 . “ You may easily call to mind , a late instance of the humanity and conscience of this race of men here in England : For when his majesty , not long since , attempted to follow his own inclinations , and emitted a declaration of indulgence to tender consciences , the whole posse cleri seemed to be raised against him : Every reader and Gibeonite of the church could then talk as saucily of their king , as they do now of the late honourable Parliament ; nay , they began to stand upon their terms , and delivered it out as orthodox doctrine , that the king was to act according to law , and , therefore , could not suspend a penal statute ; that the subjects ’ obedience was a legal obedience ; and , therefore , if the king commanded any thing contrary to law , the subject was not bound to obey ; with so many other honest positions , that men wondered in God how such knaves should come by them . But wherefore was all this wrath , and all this doctrine ? merely because his majesty was pleased for a time to remove the sore backs of dissenters from under the ecclesiastical lash ; the bloody exercise of which is never denied to holy church , but the magistrate is immediately assaulted with the noise and clamour of Demetrius and his craftsmen .</p>
   <p>“ But now , the tables being turned , the same mercenary tongues are again all Sibthorp , and all Manwaring ; not a bit of law , or conscience either , is now to be had for love or money ; not any limits to be put to the king 's commands , or our obedience . It is a gospel truth with these men , that all which we have is the king 's ; and if he should command our estates , our wives and children , yea , and our religion too , we ought to resign them up , submit , and be silent . ” — The Freeholders ’ Choice , or , A Letter of Advice concerning Elections .</p>

   <p>The first expression in these lines seems to have been a favourite with Dryden . In the Introduction to the Translation of Juvenal , he makes it his glory , “ that , being naturally vindicative , he had suffered in silence , and possessed his soul in quiet . ”</p>
   <p>The arguments used by the Panther in this passage seem to have more weight than her antagonist allows them . It was surely reasonable , that the church of England should rest upon her penal statutes and test act , as the sole mode of preventing the encroachments of her rival during a Catholic reign , and at the same time that she should look forward with pleasure to a future period , when such severe enactments might be no longer necessary for her safety ; a time , of which it has been our good fortune to witness the arrival .</p>
   <p>The argument of the Panther , in this speech , is , with the simile of the inundation , literally versified from an answer to Penn 's pamphlet . “ The penal laws cannot prejudice the Papists in this king 's reign , seeing he can connive at the non-execution of them , and the repeal of them now cannot benefit the Papists when he is gone ; because , if they do not behave themselves modestly , we can either re-establish them , or enact others , which they will be as little fond of . But their abrogation at this time would infallibly prejudice us , and would prove to be the pulling up of the sluices , and the throwing down the dikes , which stem the deluge that is breaking in upon us , and which hinder the threatening waves from overflowing us . ” Some reflections on a discourse , entitled , “ Good Advice to the Church of England . ” — State Tracts , Vol .

   <p>This conveys a perilous insinuation , which perhaps it would , at the time , have been prudent to suppress ; since it goes the length of preparing a justification of the resumption of the power , authority , lands , and revenues , of the church of England , upon the footing of their having originally belonged to that of Rome . It cannot be supposed that this hint could be passed over at the time , without a strong feeling of a meditated revolution in church government and property .</p>

   <p>Burnet , in the “ History of his Own Times , ” gives the following account of the relief which James , either from inclination or policy , extended to the French Protestants , who were exiled by the recal of the edict of Nantes .</p>
   <p>“ But now the session of Parliament drew on , and there was a great expectation of the issue of it . For some weeks before it met , there was such a number of refugees coming over every day , who set about a most dismal recital of the persecution in France ; and that in so many instances that were crying and odious , that , though all endeavours were used to lessen the clamour this had raised , yet the king did not stick openly to condemn it as both unchristian and unpolitic . He took pains to clear the Jesuits of it , and laid the blame of it chiefly on the king , on Madame de Maintenon , and the Archbishop of Paris . He spoke often of it with such vehemence , that there seemed to be an affectation in it . He did more : He was very kind to the refugees ; he was liberal to many of them ; he ordered a brief for a charitable collection over the nation for them all ; upon which great sums were sent in . They were deposited in good hands , and well distributed . The king also ordered them to be denizen 'd , without paying fees , and gave them great immunities . So that , in all , there came over , first and last , between forty and fifty thousand of that nation . There was such real argument of the cruel and persecuting spirit of popery , wheresoever it prevailed , that few could resist this conviction ; so that all men confessed , that the French persecution came very seasonably to awaken the nation , and open men 's eyes in so critical a conjunction ; for upon this session of Parliament all did depend . ” — BURNET , Book IV .</p>

   <p>These , and the following lines , contain a character of James II . most exquisitely drawn , though , it must be owned , with a flattering pencil . Bravery , economy , integrity , are the ingredients which Dryden has mixed for his colours . Without attempting a character of this unfortunate monarch , we may say a few words on each of the attributes ascribed to him . Bravery he unquestionably possessed ; but it was of that ordinary kind , which , though unshaken by mere personal danger , is unable to sustain its possessor in great and embarrassing political emergencies . The economy of James , being one great engine by which he hoped to carry on his projects , was so rigid as sometimes to border upon avarice . His upright integrity , the virtue upon which he chiefly prided himself , and which was the usual theme of courtly panegyric , frequently deviated into obstinacy . When he had once resolved upon a measure , he often announced his resolution with imprudence , and almost always pressed it with an open disregard of consequences . No fault can be more fatal to an English king ; because the stream of popular opinion , which would subside if unopposed , becomes irresistible when the obstinacy of a monarch persists in attempting to stem it .</p>

   <p>The virulent and abusive character which our author here draws of the clergy , and particularly those of the metropolis , differs so much from his description of the church of England , in the person of the Panther , that we may conclude it was written after the publishing of the Declaration of Indulgence , when the king had decidedly turned his favour from the established church . Their quarrel was now irreconcileable , and at immediate issue ; and Dryden therefore changes the tone of conciliation , with which he had hitherto addressed the heretic church , into that of bitter and unrelenting satire . Dryden calls them doves , in order to pave the way for terming them , as he does a little below , “ birds of Venus ; ” as disowning the doctrine of celibacy . The popular opinion , that a dove has no gall , is well known . In Scotland , this is averred to be owing to the dove which Noah dismissed from the ark having flown so long , that his gall broke ; since which occurrence , none of the species have had any .</p>

   <p>The Roman Catholic pamphlets of the time are filled with complaints , that their principles were misrepresented by the Protestant divines ; and that king-killing tenets , and others of a pernicious or absurd nature , were unjustly ascribed to them . A tract , which is written on purpose to explain their real doctrine , says , “ Is it not strange and severe , that principles , and those pretended of faith too , should be imposed upon men which they themselves renounce and detest ? If the Turks ’ Alcoran should , in like manner , be urged upon us , and we hanged up for Mahometans , all we could do or say , in such a case , would be , to die patiently , with protestations of our own innocence . And this is the posture of our condition ; we abhor , we renounce , we abominate , such principles ; we protest against them , and seal our protestations with our dying breath . What shall we say , what can we do more ? To accuse men as guilty in matters of faith , which they never owned , is the same thing as to condemn them for matters of fact which they never did . "[ 277 ] Another author , speaking in the assumed character of the established church , says , that the Catholic controvertists have often told us , that “ we behave ourselves like persons diffident of our cause , decline disputes on equal terms , and either misrepresent their tenets , as appears manifestly in their doctrines of justification and merit , satisfaction and indulgences ; or else play the buffoons , joking , scoffing , and relating stories , which , if true , would not touch religion . ” — A Remonstrance , by way of Address , &amp; c .</p>

   <p>Gilbert Burnet , well known as an historian , was born of a good family in Scotland , in 1643 . He went through his studies with success ; and , being ordained by the Bishop of Edinburgh , obtained the living of Salton , in East Lothian , in 1665 . While in this living , he drew up a memorial of the abuses of the Scotch bishops , and was instrumental in procuring the induction of Presbyterian divines into vacant churches ; a step which he afterwards condemned as imprudent .<span corresp="#note279" type="note_anchor">[ 279 ]</span>To measures so unfavourable for Episcopacy , Dryden seems to allude , in these lines :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">I know he hates the Pigeon-house and Farm ,</l>
     <l n="2">And more , in time of war , has done us harm ;</l>
     <l n="3">But all his hate on trivial points depends ,</l>
     <l n="4">Give up our forms , and we shall soon be friends .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Burnet 's opinion , or rather indifference , concerning forms , may be guessed at , from the applause with which he quotes a saying of Dr Henry More ; “ None of them are bad enough to make men bad , and I am sure none of them are good enough to make men good . ” He was next created professor of divinity at Glasgow ; but as his active temper led him to mingle much in political life , he speedily distinguished himself rather as a politician than a theologian . In 1672 he was made one of the king 's chaplains , and was in high favour both with Charles and his brother . He enjoyed much of the countenance of the Duke of Lauderdale ; but a quarrel taking place between them , the duke represented Burnet 's conduct in such terms , that he was deprived of his chaplainry , and forced to resign his professor 's chair , and abandon Scotland . He had an opportunity of revenging himself upon Lauderdale , as will be noticed in a subsequent note . During the time of the Popish plot , he again received a portion of the royal countenance . He was then preacher at the Rolls Chapel , under the patronage of Sir Harbottle Grimstone , master of the rolls , as also lecturer at St Clement 's , and enjoyed a high degree of public consideration . Having , as he conceived , a fit opportunity to awaken the conscience of Charles , he ventured upon sending him a letter , where he treated his personal vices , and the faults of his government , with great severity ,<span corresp="#note280" type="note_anchor">[ 280 ]</span>and by which he forfeited his favour for ever . This freedom , with his low-church tenets , gave also offence to the Duke of York , who was , moreover , offended with him for some interference in the affair of the Exclusion , in which , if he did not go all the length of Shaftesbury , he recommended the appointment of a prince-regent ; a measure scarcely more palatable to the successor . At length , his regard for Lord Russell , and the share which he took in penning , or circulating , his dying declaration , drew upon him the full resentment of both brothers . To this , a whimsical accident , in the choice of a text for the day of the gun-powder plot , happened to contribute . The preacher chanced ( for we must believe what he assures us , ex verbo sacerdotis ) to pitch on these words : “ Save me from the lion 's mouth ; thou hast delivered me from the horns of the unicorn . ” This was interpreted as referring to the supporters of the royal arms ; and Burnet was discharged , by the king 's command , both from lecturing at St Clement 's , and preaching at the Rolls Chapel . After this final breach with the court he went abroad , and , having travelled through France and Italy , settled in Holland at the court of the Prince of Orange . Here he did not fail , with that ready insinuation which seems to have distinguished him , to make himself of consequence to the prince , and especially to the princess , afterwards Queen Mary . From this place of refuge he sent forth several papers , in single sheets , relating to the controversy in England ; and the clergy , who had formerly looked upon him with some suspicion , began now to treat with great attention and respect a person so capable of serving their cause . He was consulted upon every emergency ; which confidence was no doubt owing partly to his situation near the person of the Prince of Orange , the Protestant heir of the crown . He stood forward as the champion of the church of England , in the controversy with Parker concerning the Test .<span corresp="#note281" type="note_anchor">[ 281 ]</span>In the “ History of his Own Times , ” the bishop talks with complacency of the sway which circumstances had given him among the clergy , and of the important matters which fell under his management ; for , by express command of the Prince of Orange , he was admitted into all the secrets of the English intrigues . These insinuations of Burnet 's importance , although they afterwards drew the ridicule of Pope , and the Tory wits of Queen Anne 's reign , may , from the very satire of Dryden , be proved to have been well founded . This acquired importance of Burnet is the alliance between the Pigeon-house and Buzzard , which Dryden reprobates , believing , or wishing to make others believe , that Burnet held opinions unfavourable to Episcopacy . James considered this divine as so formidable an enemy , that he wrote two very severe letters to his daughter against him , and proceeded so far as to insist that he should be forbidden the court ; a circumstance which did not prevent his privately receiving a double degree of countenance . A prosecution for high treason was next commenced against Burnet , and a demand was made that he should be delivered up ; which the States evaded , by declaring that he was naturalized , by marrying a Dutch lady . The court of England were then supposed to have formed some plan , as they had attempted in the case of Peyton , of seizing , or perhaps assassinating him , and a reward of L. 3000 was offered for the service . Burnet , however , confident in the protection of the prince and states of Holland , answered , replied , and retorted , and carried on almost an immediate controversy with his sovereign , dated from the court of his son-in-law . This active politician had a very important share in the Revolution , and reaped his reward , by being advanced to the see of Salisbury . He died on the 17th of March , 1714-15 .</p>
   <p>His writings , theological , political , and polemical , are very numerous ; but he is most remarkable as an historian . The “ History of the Reformation , ” but more especially that of “ His Own Times , ” raises him to a high rank among our English historians .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>It must be owned , that , with all Bishop Burnet 's good qualities , there are particulars in his history which give colour for this accusation . His opinions were often hastily adopted , and of course sometimes awkwardly retracted , and his patrons were frequently changed . Thus , he vindicated the legality of divorce for barrenness on the part of the wife , and even that of polygamy , in his resolution of two important cases of conscience . These were intended to pave the way for Charles divorcing his barren wife Catherine , or marrying another ; and so raising a family of his own to succeed him , instead of the Duke of York . These opinions he formally retracted . Notwithstanding his zeal for liberty , his first work is said by Swift to have been written in defense of arbitrary power . Above all , his great intimacy with the Dukes of Hamilton and Lauderdale , the King and the Duke of York , the Pope and the Prince of Orange ; in short , his having the address to attach himself for a time to almost every leading character , whom he had an opportunity of approaching , gives us room to suspect , that if Burnet did not change his opinions , he had at least the art of disguising such as could not be accommodated to those of his immediate patron . When the king demanded that Burnet should be delivered up by the States , he threatened , in return , to justify himself , by giving an account of the share he had in affairs for twenty years past ; in which he intimated , he might be driven to mention some particulars , which would displease the king . This threat , as he had enjoyed a considerable share of his confidence when Duke of York , may seem , in some degree , to justify Dryden 's heavy charge against him , of availing himself of past confidence to criminate former patrons . It is remarkable , also , that even while he was in the secret of all the intrigues of the Revolution , and must have considered it as a near attempt , he continued to assert the doctrine of passive obedience ; and in his letter to Middleton , in vindication of his conduct against the charge of high treason , there is an affectation of excessive loyalty to the reigning monarch . Against these instances of dissimulation , forced upon him perhaps by circumstances , but still unworthy and degrading , we may oppose many others , in which , when his principles and interest were placed at issue , he refused to serve the latter at the expence of the former .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>This applies to the sketches of characters introduced by Burnet in his controversial tracts . But long after the period when Dryden wrote , the publication of the History of his Own Times confirmed , to a certain extent , the censure here imposed . It is a general and just objection to the bishop 's historical characters , that they are drawn up with too much severity , and that the keenness of party has induced him , in many cases , to impose upon the reader a caricature for a resemblance . Yet there appears to have been perfect good faith upon his own part ; so that we may safely acquit him of any intention to exaggerate the faults , or conceal the virtues , of his political enemies . He seems himself to have been conscious of a disposition to look upon the dark side of humanity . “ I find , ” says he , “ that the long experience I have had of the baseness , the malice , and the falsehood of mankind , has inclined me to be apt to think generally the worst of men , and of parties . ” Burnet therefore candidly puts the reader upon his guard against this predominant foible , and expressly warns him to receive what he advances with some grains of allowance .</p>
   <p>But whatever was Burnet 's private opinion of the conduct of others , and however much he might be misled by prejudice in drawing their characters , it should not be forgotten , that , in the moments of triumph which succeeded the Revolution , he not only resisted every temptation to revenge for personal injuries , but employed all his influence to recommend mild and conciliating conduct to the successful party . Some , who had suffered under the severity of James 's reign , were extremely indignant at what seemed to them to argue too much feeling for their discomfited adversaries , and too little sympathy with their own past distresses . Samuel Johnson , in particular , reprobates the Scottish bishop 's exhortations to forgiveness and forgetfulness of injuries . “ And , besides , we have Scotch doctors , to teach us the art of forgetfulness . Pray you have gude memories , gude memories ; do not remember bad things , ( meaning the murders and oppressions of the last reigns ,) but keep your memories for gude things , have gude memories . ” To this mimicry of the bishop 's dialect , in which , however , he seems to have conveyed most wholesome and sound council , Johnson adds , that , during the sitting of King William 's first parliament , while his complaints were before them , the bishop sent to him his advice , “ Not to name persons . ” “ I gave , says he , an English reply to that message ; ‘ Let him mind his business , I will mind mine . ’ His bookseller , Mr Chiswell , by whom I had the message , seemed loth to carry him that blunt answer . Oh ! said I , he has got the title of a Lord lately , I must qualify my answer : ‘ Let him please to mind his own business , I will mind mine . ” — This was very natural for one smarting under sufferings , who complains , that “ while a certain traveller , ” meaning Burnet , “ was making his court to the cardinals at Rome , he got such an almanack in his bones , ( from scourging ,) as to incapacitate him from learning this Scotch trick of a gude memory . "[ 283 ] But it is the very character of moderate councils to be disgusting to those who have been hurried beyond their patience by oppression ; and Johnson 's testimony , though given with a contrary view , is highly honourable to the bishop 's prudence .</p>

   <p>In 1675 , the House of Commons being resolved to assail the Duke of Lauderdale , and knowing that Burnet , in whom he had once reposed much confidence , could bear witness to some dangerous designs and expressions , appointed the doctor to attend and be examined . His own account of this delicate transaction is as follows :</p>
   <p>“ In April 1675 , a session of parliament was held , as preparatory to one that was designed next winter , in which money was to be asked ; but none was now asked , it being only called to heal all breaches , and to beget a good understanding between the king and his people . The House of Commons fell upon Duke Lauderdale ; and those who knew what had passed between him and me , moved , that I should be examined before a committee . I was brought before them . I told them how I had been commanded out of town ; but though that was illegal , yet since it had been let fall , it was not insisted on . I was next examined concerning his design of arming the Irish Papists . I said , I , as well as others , had heard him say , he wished the Presbyterians in Scotland would rebel , that he might bring over the Irish Papists to cut their throats . I was next examined concerning the design of bringing a Scottish army into England . I desired to be excused , as to what had passed in private discourse ; to which I thought I was not bound to answer , unless it were high treason . They pressed me long , and I would give them no other answer ; so they all concluded , that I knew great matters ; and reported this specially to the House . Upon that I was sent for , and brought before the House . I stood upon it as I had done at the committee , that I was not bound to answer ; that nothing had passed that was high treason ; and as to all other things , I did not think myself bound to discover them . I said farther , I knew the Duke Lauderdale was apt to say things in a heat , which he did not intend to do ; and , since he had used myself so ill , I thought myself the more obliged not to say any thing that looked like revenge , for what I had met with from him . I was brought four times to the bar ; at last I was told , the House thought they had a right to examine into every thing that concerned the safety of the nation , as well as into matters of treason ; and they looked on me as bound to satisfy them , otherwise they would make me feel the weight of their heavy displeasure , as one that concealed what they thought was necessary to be known . Upon this I yielded , and gave an account of the discourse formerly mentioned . They laid great weight on this , and renewed their address against Duke Lauderdale .</p>
   <p>“ I was much blamed for what I had done . Some , to make it look the worse , added , that I had been his chaplain , which was false ; and that I had been much obliged to him , though I had never received any real obligation from him , but had done him great services , for which I had been very unworthily requited : Yet the thing had an ill appearance , as the disclosing of what had passed in confidence ; though I make it a great question , how far even that ought to bind a man when the designs are very wicked , and the person continued still in the same post and capacity of executing them . I have told the matter as it was , and must leave myself to the censure of the reader . My love to my country , and my private friendship , carried me , perhaps , too far ; especially since I had declared much against clergymen 's meddling in secular affairs , and yet had run myself so deep in them . ” — History of his Own Times , Vol . I. p. 375 .</p>
   <p>The discourse to which Burnet refers was of the following dangerous tendency , and took place in September 1673 .</p>
   <p>“ Duke . If the king should need an army from Scotland , to tame those in England , might the Scots be depended upon ?</p>
   <p>“ Burnet . Certainly not . The commons in the southern parts are all Presbyterians . The nobility thought they had been ill used , were generally discontented , and only waited for an opportunity to show it .</p>
   <p>“ Duke . I am of another mind . The hope of the spoil of England will bring them all in .</p>
   <p>“ Burnet . The king is ruined if he trusts to that ; for even indifferent persons , who might otherwise have been ready enough to push their fortunes without any anxious enquiries into the grounds they went upon , will not now trust the king , since he has so lately said , he would stick to his declaration ,<span corresp="#note284" type="note_anchor">[ 284 ]</span>and yet has so soon given it up .</p>
   <p>“ Duke . Hinc illæ lacrymæ . The king was forsaken in that matter , and none sticks to him but Lord Clifford and myself . ” — Ralph , with the Authorities he quotes , Vol . I. p. 275 .</p>
   <p>James II . afterwards revived the plan of maintaining a Scottish standing army , to bridle his English subjects .</p>

   <p>Such was , and is , the Captain of the Test .— P . 236 .</p>
   <p>Burnet may have been thus denominated , from having written the following pamphlets , in the controversy respecting the Test , against Parker , the apostate bishop of Oxford :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ An Enquiry into the Reasons for Abrogating the Test imposed on all</l>
     <l n="2">Members of Parliament , offered by Dr Samuel Parker , Bishop of Oxford . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ A Second Part of the Enquiry into the Reasons offered by Doctor Samuel Parker , bishop of Oxford , for Abrogating the Test ; or an Answer to his plea for Transubstantiation , and for Acquitting the Church of Rome of Idolatry . ”</p>
   <p>“ A Continuation of the Second Part of the Enquiry into the Reasons offered by Dr Samuel Parker , Bishop of Oxford , for Abrogating the Test relating to the Idolatry of the Church of Rome . ”</p>
   <p>These two last pamphlets were afterwards thrown together in one tract , entitled , “ A Discourse concerning Transubstantiation and Idolatry , being an Answer to the Bishop of Oxford 's plea relating to these two points . ”</p>
   <p>Burnet himself admits , that his papers , in this controversy with Parker , were written with an acrimony of style which nothing but such a time and such a man could excuse . His papers were so bitter , that nobody durst offer them to the bishop of Oxford , till the king himself sent them to him , in hopes to stimulate him to an answer .</p>
   <p>Several of these pieces seem to have been published after “ The Hind and the Panther ; ” but it must have been generally known at the time , that Burnet had placed himself in the front of this controversy .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">And much the Buzzard in their cause did stir ,</l>
     <l n="2">Though naming not the patron , to infer ,</l>
     <l n="3">With all respect , he was a gross idolater .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The passage particularly referred to in these lines occurs in a tract , entitled , “ Reasons against repealing the Act of Parliament , concerning the Test , ” which is the first of six papers published by Dr Burnet when in Holland , and reprinted at London in 1689 . His words are these :</p>
   <p>“ IX . I am told some think it very indecent to have a test for our parliaments , in which the king 's religion is accused of idolatry ; but if this reason is good in this particular , it will be full as good against several of the articles of our church , and many of the homilies . If the church and religion of this nation is so formed by law , that the king 's religion is declared over and over again to be idolatrous , what help is there for it ? It is no other than it was when his majesty was crowned , and swore to maintain our laws .</p>
   <p>“ I hope none will be wanting in all possible respect to his sacred person ; and as we ought to be infinitely sorry to find him engaged in a religion which we must believe idolatrous , so we are far from the ill manners of reflecting on his person , or calling him an idolater : for as every man that reports a lie , is not for that to be called a liar ; so that , though the ordering the intention , and the prejudice of a mis-persuasion , are such abatements , that we will not rashly take on us to call every man of the church of Rome an idolater ; yet , on the other hand , we can never lay down our charge against the church of Rome as guilty of idolatry , unless at the same time we part with our religion . ”</p>
   <p>We cannot suppose that Burnet was insensible to the poignancy of Dryden 's satire ; for , although he attempts to treat the poem with contempt , in the defence of his “ Reflections on Varillas ’ History , ” his coarse and virulent character of the poet plainly shows his inward feelings . “ I have been informed from England , that a gentleman , who is known both for poetry and other things , had spent three months in translating M. Varillas 's History ; but that , as soon as my Reflections appeared , he discontinued his labour , finding the credit of his author was gone . Now , if he thinks it is recovered by his Answer , he will perhaps go on with his translation ; and this may be , for aught I know , as good an entertainment for him as the conversation that he had set on between the Hinds and Panthers , and all the rest of animals , for whom M. Varillas may serve well enough for an author : and this history and that poem are such extraordinary things of their kind , that it will be but suitable to see the author of the worst poem , become likewise the translator of the worst history , that the age has produced . If his grace and his wit improve both proportionably , he will hardly find that he has gained much by the change he has made , from having no religion to choose one of the worst . It is true , he had something to sink from , in matter of wit ; but as for his morals , it is scarce possible for him to grow a worse man than he was . He has lately wreaked his malice on me for spoiling his three months ’ labour ; but in it he has done me all the honour that any man can receive from him , which is to be railed at by him . If I had ill-nature enough to prompt me to wish a very bad wish for him , it should be , that he would go on and finish his translation . By that it will appear , whether the English nation , which is the most competent judge in this matter , has , upon the seeing our debate , pronounced in M. Varillas 's favour , or in mine . It is true , Mr D. will suffer a little by it ; but at least it will serve to keep him in from other extravagancies ; and if he gains little honour by this work , yet he cannot lose so much by it , as he has done by his last employment . ”</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Part of the controversy which now raged , turned on the precise meaning of the king 's promise , to maintain the church of England as by law established . The church party insisted , that the Declaration of Indulgence was a breach of this promise , as it suspended their legal safeguards , the test and penal laws . The advocates for the toleration answered , that the promise was conditional , and depended on the church consenting to the abrogation of these laws . This was stated by Penn , in his “ Good Advice ; ” to which the following indignant answer is made by a champion of the church , perhaps Burnet himself :</p>
   <p>“ And if there be no other way of giving the king an opportunity of keeping his word with the church of England , in preserving her , and maintaining our religion , but the repealing of the penal and test laws , as he intimates unto us , ( Good Advice , p . 50 . ) we have not found the royal faith so sacred and inviolable in other instances , as to rob ourselves of a legal defence and protection , for to depend upon the precarious one of a base promise , which his ghostly fathers , whensoever they find it convenient , will tell him it was unlawful to make , and which he can have a dispensation for the breaking of , at what time he pleaseth . Nor do we remember , that when he pledged his faith unto us , in so many promises , that the parting with our laws was declared to be the condition upon which he made , and undertook to perform them . Neither can any have the confidence to allege it , without having recourse to the Papal doctrine of mental reservation . Which being one of the principles of that order , under whose conduct he is , makes us justly afraid to rely upon his word without further security . However , we do hereby see , with what little sincerity Mr Penn writes ; and what small regard he hath to his majesty 's honour , when he tells the church of England , that if she please , and like the terms of giving up the penal and test laws against Papists , that then the king will perform his word with her ; ( Good Advice , p . 17 . ) but that otherwise , it is she who breaks with him , and not he with her . ” ( Ibid . p . 44 . )</p>

   </lg>
   <p>The declaration for liberty of conscience was a strange and incongruous , as well as most impolitic performance . It set out with declaring , that although the king heartily wished that all his subjects were members of the Catholic church , ( which they returned , by heartily wishing that he were a Protestant ,) yet he abhorred all idea of constraining conscience ; and therefore , making no doubt of the concurrence of Parliament , declared , 1 . That he would protect and maintain the bishops , &amp; c. of the church of England , as by law established , in the free exercise of their religion , and quiet enjoyment of their possessions . 2 . That all execution of penal laws against non-conformists be suspended . 3 . That all his majesty 's subjects should be at liberty to serve God after their own way , in public and private , so nothing was preached against the royal authority . 4 . That the oaths of supremacy and allegiance , and the tests made in the 25th and 30th years of Charles II ., be discontinued . 5 . That all non-conformists be pardoned for former offences against the penal laws and test . 6 . That abbey and church lands be assured to the possessors .</p>
   <p>Such were the contents of this memorable Declaration , in which a bigotted purpose was cloaked under professions of the highest liberality ; and prevarication and falsehood were rendered more disgusting , by being mingled with very unseasonable truth .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>When the king had irreconcileably quarrelled with the church , he began to affect a great favour for the dissenters ; and , as has been often hinted , endeavoured to represent the measure of universal toleration to be intended as much for the benefit of the Protestant dissenters as of the Catholics . He dwelt upon the rigour of the church courts , and directed an inquiry to be made into all the vexatious suits which had been instituted against the dissenters , and the compositions which had been exacted from them , under pretence of enforcing the laws . In short , Burnet assures us , that the royal bed-chamber and drawing-room were as full of stories to the prejudice of the clergy , as they used formerly to abound with declamations against the fanatics .</p>

   <p>In the preceding lines , the poet had intimated the increase of trade and wealth ; an effect of toleration , much dwelt upon in James 's proclamation for liberty of conscience , and , indeed , the ostensible cause of its being issued . But Dryden , as every one else , further augured from the Declaration of Indulgence , under the circumstances of the time , the speedy downfall of the church of England , though he is willing to spare the king the odium of hastening what he represents as the natural consequence of her own ambition and intolerance . A writer of his party is less scrupulous in expressing the king 's intentions : “ So , on the whole matter , the loyal church of England must either change her old principles of loyalty , and take example by her Catholic neighbours , how to behave herself towards a prince who is not of her persuasion , or she must give his majesty leave not to nourish a snake in his own bosom , but rather to withdraw his royal protection , which was promised on account of her constant fidelity : For it is an approved axiom in philosophy , Cessante causa , tollitur effectus ; and we have a common saying of our own , No longer pipe , no longer dance . And now let us leave the holy mother church at liberty to consult what new measures of loyalty she ought to take for her own dear interest , and , for aught I know , it may be worth her serious consideration . ” — New Test of the Church of England 's Loyalty .</p>

   <p>Dryden insinuates the improbability , that the high and low church party would long continue in union , since the authority assumed by Burnet , their present advocate , was inconsistent with that of Sancroft the primate , Compton bishop of London , and other leaders of the high church party among the clergy . He resumes the theme of Burnet 's alleged disinclination for episcopacy . In fact , although his lot cast him into the church of England , the bishop of Sarum , in many parts of his writings , expresses an unfavourable opinion of her clergy , whom in one place he calls the most remiss of any in Europe . Even this harsh expression is nothing to the following account of the controversy between the clergy and dissenters , as it stands in the MS. of his history ; for it is greatly softened in the printed copy :</p>
   <p>“ Many books came out likewise against the church of England . This alarmed the bishops and clergy much ; so that they set up to preach against rebellion , and the late times , in such a strain , that it was visible they meant a parallel between these and the present time . And this produced at last that heat and rage into which the clergy has run so far , that it is like to end very fatally . They , on their part , should have shewed more temper , and more of the spirit of the gospel ; whereas , for the greatest part , they are the worst natured , the fiercest , indiscreetest , and most persecuting sort of people that are in the nation . There is a sort of them do so aspire to preferment , that there is nothing so mean and indecent that they will not do to compass it ; and when they have got into preferments , they take no care , either of themselves , or of the flocks committed to their charge , but do generally neglect their parishes . If they are rich enough , they hire some pitiful curate , at as low a price as they can , and turn all over on him ; or , if their income will not bear out that , they perform the public offices in the slightest manner they can , but take no care of their people in the way of private instruction or admonition ; and so do nothing to justify the character of pastors or watchmen , that feed the souls of their people , or watch over them . And they allow themselves in many indecent liberties , of going to taverns and ale-houses , and of railing scurrilously against all that differ from them : and they cherish the profaneness of their people , if they but come to church , and rail with them against the dissenters ; and are implacably set on the ruin of all that separate from them , if the course of their lives were otherwise ever so good and unblameable . In a word , many of them are a reproach to Christianity and to their profession ; and are now , perhaps , one of the most corrupt bodies of men in the nation . ” — Somers ’ Tracts , p. 116 .</p>

   <p>VIRG . GEORG . 1 .</p>
   <p>BRITANNIA REDIVIVA .</p>
   <p>The remarkable incident , which gave rise to the following poem , was hailed by the Catholics with the most unbounded joy . That party , whose transient prosperity depended upon the declining life of James II ., could hardly enjoy their present power , embittered as it was by the reflection , that it must end with the reign of the king and the succession of the Princess of Orange . Many circumstances seemed to render the hopes of the king having a male heir of his body extremely precarious . His system was said to have been injured by early dissipation , and he was now advanced in life . The queen , also , had been in a bad state of health ; had lost all her children soon after they were born ; and had now , for several years , ceased to have any . Amidst these discouraging considerations , the queen 's pregnancy was announced in 1687 ; and even before his birth , addressers and panegyrists in verse hailed the future prince , as a pledge for the maintenance of liberty of conscience , and the security of the royal line .<span corresp="#note285" type="note_anchor">[ 285 ]</span></p>
   <p>But the Catholics were so transported with this unexpected happiness , that they could not refrain from spreading an hundred follies , tending to connect the queen 's pregnancy with the efficacy of the king 's faith . Some said , that the queen 's conception took place at the very time when her mother made a vow to the Lady of Loretto , that her daughter might by her means have a son : Others attributed it to the queen 's personal influence with Saint Xavier : Others to the intercessions of the Jesuits , among whom the king had enrolled himself : All ascribed so happy and unhoped an event to something more than mere natural causes , and ventured to presage , that the joyful fruit of the queen 's conception would prove a son , since otherwise , it was said , God would have done his work by halves .<span corresp="#note286" type="note_anchor">[ 286 ]</span>It is dangerous for a religious sect to cry , a miracle ! for it is always echoed by their adversaries , shouting out , an imposture ! The same circumstances which induced the Catholics to believe that this happy event was owing to a peculiar divine interposition , led the nation to ascribe so unexpected and opportune an occurrence to artifice and imposition ; and they were prepared to pronounce a birth spurious , which their adversaries had incautiously pushed to the verge of miraculous .</p>
   <p>On the 10th of June , 1688 , the prince was born , under circumstances which ought to have removed all suspicion of imposture . But these suspicions were too deeply rooted in party prejudices and fears ; and it became a distinguishing mark of a true Protestant , to hold for spurious the birth of a prince , which took place in the presence of more people than is either consistent with custom or decency .</p>
   <p>In the mean while , public rejoicings , of the most splendid kind , were solemnized at home and abroad ;<span corresp="#note287" type="note_anchor">[ 287 ]</span>and the poets flocked with their addresses of congratulation<span corresp="#note288" type="note_anchor">[ 288 ]</span>on the birth of a Prince of Wales , who was doomed shortly to be distinguished through the English dominions by the ignominious appellation of Pretender , and abroad , by the dubious title of Chevalier de St George . It was peculiarly the part of our author , as poet-laureat , and a good Catholic , to solemnize an event of so much importance to the king , and those of his religion , and to bear down , if possible , the popular prejudice by the exertion of his poetical powers . “ Britannia Rediviva ” was written , nine days after the event celebrated , and published accordingly . It is licensed on the 19th of June .</p>
   <p>In this poem , our author assumes the tone and feeling which we have described as general among the Catholics , upon this happy and unexpected event . It is less an address of congratulation than a solemn devotional hymn ; and , even considered as such , abounds with expressions of awful gratitude , rather for a miraculous interposition of heaven and the blessed saints , than for a blessing conferred through the ordinary course of nature . Dryden , who knew how to assume every style that fitted the occasion , writes here in the character of a devout and grateful Catholic , with much of the unction which marks the hymns of the Roman church . In English poetry , we have hardly another example of the peculiar tone which the invocation of saints , and an enthusiastic faith in the mystic doctrines of the Catholic faith , can give to poetry . To me , I confess , that communion seems to offer the same facilities to the poet , which it has been long famous for affording to the painter ; and the “ Britannia Rediviva , ” while it celebrates the mystic influence of the sacred festivals of the Paraclete and the Trinity , and introduces the warlike forms of St Michael and St George , has often reminded me of one of the ancient altar pieces , which it is impossible to regard without reverence , though presenting miracles which never happened , or saints who never existed . These subordinate divinities are something upon which the imagination , dazzled and overwhelmed by the contemplation of a single Omnipotent Being , can fairly rest and expand itself . They approach nearer to humanity and to comprehension ; yet are sufficiently removed from both , to have the full effect of sublime obscurity . Dryden has undoubtedly reaped considerable advantage from religion in the present poem . It must , however , be owned , that the effect of these passages is much injured by the frequent allusion to the deities of classical mythology ; and that Dryden has ranked the gods and goddesses of ancient Rome with the saints of her modern church , in the same indiscriminate order in which they are classed in the Pantheon . We have the Giants ’ War immediately preceding the miracle wrought on the Shunamite 's son ; and the serpents of the infant Hercules are classed in the very sentence with the dragons of the Apocalypse . On one occasion he has stooped yet lower , and condescended to pun upon the child 's being born on Trinity Sunday , as promising at least a trine of infant princes .</p>
   <p>Still , however , the strain of the poem is , upon the whole , grave and exalted . Besides the general tone of “ Britannia Rediviva , ” there are many passages in it deserving the reader 's attention . The address to the queen , beginning , “ But you , propitious queen , ” has all the smoothness with which Dryden could vary the masculine character of his general poetry , when he addressed the female sex , and forms a marked contrast to the more majestic tone of the rest of the piece . It may indeed be said of Dryden , as he himself says of Virgil , that though he is smooth where smoothness is required , yet he is so far from affecting that general character , that he seems rather to disdain it .</p>
   <p>The original edition of the “ Britannia Rediviva ” is in quarto , printed , as usual , for Tonson , with a motto from the first book of the Georgics , which is now restored . The concluding lines refer to the death of so many Catholics by the perjured evidences of Oates and Bedlow :</p>
   <p>—— satis jampridem sanguine nostro Laomedonteæ luimus perjuria Trojæ .</p>
   <p>The word perjuria , as well as Puerum , in the preceding passage , are marked by a difference of type ; a mode of soliciting the attention of the reader to a pointed remark or inuendo , which was first used in Charles II . ' s time , and seems to have been introduced by L'Estrange , who carried it to a most extravagant degree , chequering his Observators with all manner of characters , from the Roman to the Anglo-Saxon .</p>
   <p>FOOTNOTES :</p>
   <note xml:id="note285" place="bottom" n="285">The addresses of the grand juries of the counties of Monmouth , Stafford , Glocester , Yorkshire , &amp; c. &amp; c ., all pressed forward upon this occasion , and are all positive that the blessed hope of the queen 's womb must necessarily prove a son , since the king seemed to have very little occasion for more daughters . Edmund Arwaker is of the same opinion , in his poem humbly dedicated to the queen , on occasion of her majesty 's happy conception .</note>
   <note xml:id="note286" place="bottom" n="286">“ That which does us most harm with the lords and great men , is the apprehension of a heretic successor : For as a lord told me lately , assure me of a Catholic successor , and I assure you I and my family will be so too . To this purpose the queen 's happy delivery will be of very great moment . Our zealous Catholics do already lay two to one that it will be a prince . God does nothing by halves , and every day masses are said upon this very occasion . ” — Letter from Father Petre to Father La Chaise . This letter is a forgery , but it distinctly expresses the hopes and apprehensions of both parties .</note>
   <note xml:id="note287" place="bottom" n="287">The most remarkable were celebrated at the Hague , by the Marquis of Abbeville , his majesty 's ambassador there . On one side of a triumphal arch were the figures of Truth and Justice , with this inscription : Veritas et Justitia fulcimentum throni Patris et erunt mei : On the other side were Religion and Liberty embracing , with this motto , Religio et Libertas amplexatæ erant . On the portico was painted the conquest of the dragon by St George , and the delivery of St Margaret , explained to allude to the liberty of conscience procured by James 's abolition of the test and penal laws . These decorations , remarkable for their import , and the place in which they were exhibited , were accompanied with the discharge of fire-works , and other public rejoicings . There are particular accounts of the splendid rejoicings at Ratisbon and Paris , &amp; c. &amp; c. in the Gazettes of the period .</note>

     <l n="228">How was I punished , when the sudden blast<span corresp="#note325" type="note_anchor">[ 325 ]</span></l>
     <l n="229">The face of heaven , and our young sun , o'ercast !</l>
     <l n="230">Fame , the swift ill increasing as she rolled ,</l>
     <l n="231">Disease , despair , and death , at three reprises told :</l>
     <l n="232">At three insulting strides she stalked the town ,</l>
     <l n="233">And , like contagion , struck the loyal down .</l>
     <l n="234">Down fell the winnowed wheat ; but , mounted high ,</l>
     <l n="235">The whirlwind bore the chaff , and hid the sky .</l>
     <l n="236">Here black rebellion shooting from below , }</l>
     <l n="237">( As earth 's gigantic brood by moments grow ,) }</l>
     <l n="238">And here the sons of God are petrified with woe :}</l>
     <l n="239">An apoplex of grief ! so low were driven</l>
     <l n="240">The saints , as hardly to defend their heaven .</l>
     <l n="241">As , when pent vapours run their hollow round ,</l>
     <l n="242">Earthquakes , which are convulsions of the ground ,</l>
     <l n="243">Break bellowing forth , and no confinement brook ,</l>
     <l n="244">Till the third settles what the former shook ;</l>
     <l n="245">Such heavings had our souls , till , slow and late ,</l>
     <l n="246">Our life with his returned , and faith prevailed on fate .</l>
     <l n="247">By prayers the mighty blessing was implored ,</l>
     <l n="248">To prayers was granted , and by prayers restored .</l>
     <l n="249">So , ere the Shunamite a son conceived ,</l>
     <l n="250">The prophet promised , and the wife believed ;</l>
     <l n="251">A son was sent , the son so much desired ,</l>
     <l n="252">But soon upon the mother 's knees expired .</l>
     <l n="253">The troubled seer approached the mournful door ,</l>
     <l n="254">Ran , prayed , and sent his pastoral staff before ,</l>
     <l n="255">Then stretched his limbs upon the child , and mourned ,</l>
     <l n="256">Till warmth , and breath , and a new soul returned .<span corresp="#note326" type="note_anchor">[ 326 ]</span></l>
     <l n="257">Thus mercy stretches out her hand , and saves</l>
     <l n="258">Desponding Peter , sinking in the waves .</l>
     <l n="259">As when a sudden storm of hail and rain</l>
     <l n="260">Beats to the ground the yet unbearded grain ,</l>
     <l n="261">Think not the hopes of harvest are destroyed</l>
     <l n="262">On the flat field , and on the naked void ;</l>
     <l n="263">The light , unloaded stem , from tempest freed ,</l>
     <l n="264">Will raise the youthful honours of his head ;</l>
     <l n="265">And , soon restored by native vigour , bear</l>
     <l n="266">The timely product of the bounteous year .</l>
     <l n="267">Nor yet conclude all fiery trials past ,</l>
     <l n="268">For heaven will exercise us to the last ;</l>
     <l n="269">Sometimes will check us in our full career ,</l>
     <l n="270">With doubtful blessings , and with mingled fear ,</l>
     <l n="271">That , still depending on his daily grace ,</l>
     <l n="272">His every mercy for an alms may pass ;</l>
     <l n="273">With sparing hands will diet us to good ,</l>
     <l n="274">Preventing surfeits of our pampered blood .</l>
     <l n="275">So feeds the mother bird her craving young</l>
     <l n="276">With little morsels , and delays them long .</l>
     <l n="277">True , this last blessing was a royal feast ;</l>
     <l n="278">But where 's the wedding-garment on the guest ?</l>
     <l n="279">Our manners , as religion were a dream ,</l>
     <l n="280">Are such as teach the nations to blaspheme .</l>
     <l n="281">In lusts we wallow , and with pride we swell ,</l>
     <l n="282">And injuries with injuries repel ;</l>
     <l n="283">Prompt to revenge , not daring to forgive ,</l>
     <l n="284">Our lives unteach the doctrine we believe .</l>
     <l n="285">Thus Israel sinned , impenitently hard ,</l>
     <l n="286">And vainly thought the present ark their guard ;<span corresp="#note327" type="note_anchor">[ 327 ]</span></l>
     <l n="287">But when the haughty Philistines appear , }</l>
     <l n="288">They fled , abandoned to their foes and fear ; }</l>
     <l n="289">Their God was absent , though his ark was there . }</l>
     <l n="290">Ah ! lest our crimes should snatch this pledge away ,</l>
     <l n="291">And make our joys the blessings of a day !</l>
     <l n="292">For we have sinned him hence , and that he lives ,</l>
     <l n="293">God to his promise , not our practice , gives .</l>
     <l n="294">Our crimes would soon weigh down the guilty scale ,</l>
     <l n="295">But James and Mary , and the church prevail .</l>
     <l n="296">Nor Amalek<span corresp="#note328" type="note_anchor">[ 328 ]</span>can rout the chosen bands ,</l>
     <l n="297">While Hur and Aaron hold up Moses ’ hands .</l>
     <l n="298">By living well , let us secure his days ,</l>
     <l n="299">Moderate in hopes , and humble in our ways .</l>
     <l n="300">No force the free-born spirit can constrain ,</l>
     <l n="301">But charity , and great examples gain .</l>
     <l n="302">Forgiveness is our thanks for such a day ;</l>
     <l n="303">‘ Tis godlike God in his own coin to pay .</l>
     <l n="304">But you , propitious queen , translated here , }</l>
     <l n="305">From your mild heaven , to rule our rugged sphere ,}</l>
     <l n="306">Beyond the sunny walks , and circling year ; }</l>
     <l n="307">You , who your native climate have bereft</l>
     <l n="308">Of all the virtues , and the vices left ;</l>
     <l n="309">Whom piety and beauty make their boast ,</l>
     <l n="310">Though beautiful is well in pious lost ;</l>
     <l n="311">So lost as star-light is dissolved away ,</l>
     <l n="312">And melts into the brightness of the day ;</l>
     <l n="313">Or gold about the royal diadem ,</l>
     <l n="314">Lost , to improve the lustre of the gem ,—</l>
     <l n="315">What can we add to your triumphant day ?</l>
     <l n="316">Let the great gift the beauteous giver pay ;</l>
     <l n="317">For should our thanks awake the rising sun , }</l>
     <l n="318">And lengthen , as his latest shadows run , }</l>
     <l n="319">That , though the longest day , would soon , too soon be done . }</l>
     <l n="320">Let angels ’ voices with their harps conspire ,</l>

     <l n="333">The name of great your martial mind will suit ;</l>

     <l n="339">Some kings the name of conquerors have assumed ,</l>
     <l n="340">Some to be great , some to be gods presumed ;</l>
     <l n="341">But boundless power , and arbitrary lust ,</l>
     <l n="342">Made tyrants still abhor the name of just ;</l>
     <l n="343">They shunned the praise this godlike virtue gives ,</l>
     <l n="344">And feared a title that reproached their lives .</l>
     <l n="345">The power , from which all kings derive their state ,</l>
     <l n="346">Whom they pretend , at least , to imitate ,</l>
     <l n="347">Is equal both to punish and reward ;</l>
     <l n="348">For few would love their God , unless they feared .</l>
     <l n="349">Resistless force and immortality</l>
     <l n="350">Make but a lame , imperfect deity ;</l>
     <l n="351">Tempests have force unbounded to destroy ,</l>
     <l n="352">And deathless being even the damned enjoy ;</l>
     <l n="353">And yet heaven 's attributes , both last and first ,</l>
     <l n="354">One without life , and one with life accurst ;</l>
     <l n="355">But justice is heaven 's self , so strictly he ,</l>
     <l n="356">That could it fail , the godhead could not be .</l>
     <l n="357">This virtue is your own ; but life and state</l>
     <l n="358">Are , one to fortune subject , one to fate :</l>
     <l n="359">Equal to all , you justly frown or smile ; }</l>
     <l n="360">Nor hopes nor fears your steady hand beguile ; }</l>

     <l n="2">Hail , son of prayers ! by holy violence</l>
     <l n="3">Drawn down from heaven !—— P . 290 .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>We have noticed , in the introduction , that the birth of a Prince of Wales , at a time of such critical importance to the Catholic faith , was looked upon , by the Papists , as little less than miraculous . Some talked of the petition of the Duchess of Modena to Our Lady of Loretto ; and Burnet affirms , that , in that famous chapel , there is actually a register of the queen 's conception , in consequence of her mother 's vow . But , in that case , the good duchess 's intercession must have been posthumous ; for she died upon the 19th July , and the queen 's time run from the 6th of October . Others ascribed the event to the king 's pilgrimage to St Winifred 's Well ; and others , among whom was the Earl of Melfort , suffered their zeal to hurry them into profaneness , and spoke of the angel of the Lord moving the Bath waters , like the Pool of Bethsaida . But the Jesuits claimed to their own prayers the principal merit of procuring this blessing , which , indeed , they had ventured to prophecy ; for , among other devices which that order exhibited to the English ambassador from James to the Pope , there was , according to Mr Misson , one of a lily , from whose leaves distilled some drops of water , which were once supposed , by naturalists , to become the seed of new lilies : the motto was — Lachrimor in prolem — “ I weep for children . ” Beneath which was the following distich :</p>
   <p>Pro natis , Jacobe , gemis , flos candide regum ! Hos natura tibi si neget , astra dabunt .</p>
   <p>For sons , fair flower of kings , why melts thine eye ? The heavens shall grant what nature may deny .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>“ And the dragon stood before the woman , who was ready to be delivered , for to devour her child , as soon as it was born , ” — Revel . xii . 4 . Dryden is at pains , by an original marginal note , which , with others , is restored in this edition , to explain , that , by this allusion here , and in other parts of the poem , he meant “ the commonwealth 's party . ” The acquittal of the bishops , on the 17th of June , two days before the poem was licensed , must have excited a prudential reverence for the church of England in the moment of her triumph . The poet fixes upon this commonwealth party therefore , exclusively , the common reports which had been circulated during the queen 's pregnancy , and which are thus noticed in the ( supposititious ) letter to Father La Chaise : “ As to the queen 's being with child , that great concern goes as well as we could wish , notwithstanding all the satirical discourses of the heretics , who content themselves to vent their poison in libels , which , by night , they disperse in the street , or fix upon the walls . There was one lately found upon a pillar of a church , that imported , that such a day thanks should be given to God for the queen 's being great with a cushion . If one of these pasquil-makers could be discovered , he would but have an ill time o n't , and should be made to take his last farewell at Tyburn . ”</p>
   <p>The usual topics of wit , during the queen 's pregnancy , were , allusions to a cushion , a tympany , &amp; c. &amp; c .; and Partridge , the Protestant almanack-maker , utters the following predictions :— “ That there was some bawdy project on foot , either about buying , selling , or procuring , a child or children , for some pious uses . ” And , again , “ Some child is to be topped upon the lawful heirs , to cheat them out of their right and estate . ” — “ God preserve the kingdom of England from invasion ! for about this time I fear it in earnest , and keep the Protestants there from being dragooned . ”</p>
   <p>One single circumstance is sufficient to rout all suspicions thus carefully infused into the people . It is well known , and is noticed in one of L'Estrange ' s papers at the time , that a similar outcry was raised during a former pregnancy of the queen ; but the child proving a female , there was no use for pushing the calumny any further upon that occasion .</p>

   <p>The public exercise of the Catholic religion in England is compared to the miraculous display of the cross , with the motto , In hoc signo vinces ; which is said to have appeared to Constantine on the eve of his great victory .</p>
   <p>The war against the Turks , which was now raging in Hungary , seems to have occupied much of James 's attention . He amused himself with anxiety about the fate of this holy warfare , as he probably thought it , while his own crown was tottering on his head . In all his letters to the Prince of Orange , he expresses his wishes for the peace of Christendom , that the emperor and the Venetians might have leisure to prosecute the war against the Turks ; and conjectures about the taking of Belgrade , and the progress of the Duke of Lorraine , are very gravely sent , as interesting matter to the prince , who was anticipating the conquest of England , and the dethronement of his father-in-law . There may be something of affectation in this ; but , as Dryden takes up the same tone , it may be supposed to have forwarded James 's general conversation , as well as his letters to the Prince of Orange .— See DALRYMPLE 'S Memoirs .

   </lg>
   <p>Dryden talks of the Pope with the respect of a good Catholic . Nevertheless it happened , by a very odd chance , that , while the throne of England was held by a Catholic , for the first time during the course of a century , the chair of St Peter was occupied by Innocent XI . who acquired the uncommon epithet of the Protestant Pope . He received , with great coldness , the Earl of Castlemain , whom James sent to Rome as his ambassador , and refused the only two requests which a king of England had made to Rome since the days of Henry VIII ., although they were only a dispensation to Petre the king 's confessor , to hold a bishopric , and another to the Mareschal D'Humier ' s daughter to marry within the prohibited degrees . Nay , the Pope is said to have privately admitted the Prince of Orange 's envoy to his confidence , while he treated Castlemaine with so much contempt . The cause of this coldness was the Pope 's quarrel with James 's ally , Louis , and his dislike to the order of Jesuits , by whom the king of England was entirely ruled . In truth , Innocent XI . was much more anxious to maintain the privileges of the Roman see against those princes who retained her communion , than to add England to a flock which was become so mutinous and untractable . He was , besides , a man of no extended views , and chiefly concerned himself with managing the papal revenue , involved in debt by a succession of wasteful pontificates . To this the conversion of England promised no immediate addition , and , with the narrowness of view natural to his pursuits , Innocent XI . thought it better to employ his exertions in realizing an immediate income , than in endeavouring to extend the faith and authority of the church , by embarking in a design of great doubt and hazard . He was , therefore , but a very poor representative of Pope Sylvester . As for the last two lines , they contain , what we seldom meet with in Dryden 's poetry , a compliment not only bombastic , but unappropriate , and even unmeaning .</p>

     <l n="1">Born in broad day-light , that the ungrateful rout</l>
     <l n="2">May find no room for a remaining doubt .— P . 293 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In these lines , and the following , where the poet , with indecent freedom , compares the suspicions entertained of a spurious birth to the devil 's doubts concerning our Saviour 's godhead , he alludes to those circumstances of publicity , which one would have supposed might have rendered the birth of the prince indisputable . It took place at ten o'clock in the morning ; and eighteen privy counsellors , besides a number of ladies , were present at the delivery . But the party violence of the period was so extravagant , as to receive and circulate a variety of reports , inconsistent with each other , and agreeing only in the general conclusion , that the child was an imposition upon the nation . The reasoning of the Bishop of Salisbury , on this point , is admirably summed up by Smollet .</p>
   <p>“ On the 10th of June , 1688 , the queen was suddenly seized with labour-pains , and delivered of a son , who was baptized by the name of James , and declared Prince of Wales . All the Catholics and friends of James were transported with the most extravagant joy at the birth of this child ; while great part of the nation consoled themselves with the notion , that it was altogether supposititious . They carefully collected a variety of circumstances , upon which this conjecture was founded ; and though they were inconsistent , contradictory , and inconclusive , the inference was so agreeable to the views and passions of the people , that it made an impression which , in all probability , will never be totally effaced . Dr Burnet , who seems to have been at uncommon pains to establish this belief , and to have consulted all the Whig nurses in England upon the subject , first pretends to demonstrate , that the queen was not with child ; secondly , that she was with child , but miscarried ; thirdly , that a child was brought into the queen 's apartment in a warming-pan ; fourthly , that there was no child at all in the room ; fifthly , that the queen actually bore a child , but it died that same day ; sixthly , that it had the fits , of which it died at Richmond ; therefore , the Chevalier de St George must be the fruit of four different impostures . ”</p>
   <p>Note VI .</p>
   <p>Five months to discord and debate were given .— P . 295 .</p>
   <p>During the five months preceding the birth of the Chevalier de St George , James was wholly engaged by those feuds and dissensions which tended to render irreparable the breach between him and his subjects . The arbitrary attacks upon the privileges of Magdalen College , and of the Charter-House , fell nearly within this period . Above all , the petition of the seven bishops against reading the Declaration of Indulgence , their imprisonment , their memorable trial and acquittal , had all taken place since the month of April ; and it is well known to what a state of violent opposition the nation had been urged by a train of arbitrary acts of violence , so imprudently commenced , and perversely insisted in . Dryden , like other men of sense , probably began to foresee the consequences of so violent and general irritation ; and expresses himself in moderate and soothing language , both as to the past and future . Nothing is therefore dropt which can offend the church of England . Perhaps they may have been spared by the royal command ; for it seems , as is hinted by a letter from Halifax to the Prince of Orange , that , not finding his expectations answered by the dissenters , whom he had so greatly favoured of late , James entertained thoughts of returning to his old friends , the High-churchmen ; “ but the truth is , ” his lordship adds , “ the Papists have of late been so hard and fierce upon them , that the very species of those formerly mistaking men is destroyed ; they have so broken that loom in pieces , that they cannot now set it up again to work upon it . ” — DALRYMPLE 'S Memoirs .

   </lg>
   <p>There was , Dryden informs us , a report of the prince 's death , to which he alludes . James , in a letter to the Prince of Orange , dated June 12 , mentions the birth of his son on the Sunday preceding , and adds , “ the child was somewhat ill this last night , of the wind , and some gripes , but is now , blessed be God , very well , and like to have no returns of it , and is a strong boy . ” About this illness , Burnet tells the following gossipping story : “ That night , one Hemings , a very worthy man , an apothecary by his trade , who lived in St Martin 's Lane , the very next door to a family of an eminent Papist , ( Brown , brother to the Viscount Montacute , lived there ;) the wall between his parlour and their 's being so thin , that he could easily hear any thing that was said with a louder voice , he ( Hemings ) was reading in his parlour late at night , when he heard one come into the neighbouring parlour , and say , with a doleful voice , the Prince of Wales is dead : Upon which a great many that lived in the house came down stairs very quick . Upon this confusion he could not hear any thing more ; but it was plain they were in a great consternation . He went with the news next morning to the bishops in the Tower . The Countess of Clarendon came thither soon after , and told them , she had been at the young prince 's door , but was denied access : she was amazed at it ; and asked , if they knew her : they said , they did ; but that the queen had ordered , that no person whatsoever should be suffered to come in to him . This gave credit to Hemings ’ story ; and looked as if all was ordered to be kept shut up close , till another child was found . One , that saw the child two days after , said to me , that he looked strong , and not like a child so newly born . ”</p>
   <p>The poem of Dryden plainly proves , that such a report was so far from being confined among the Catholics , that it was spread over all the town ; and what the worthy Mr Hemings over-heard in his next neighbour 's , the Papist 's , might probably have been heard in any company in London that evening , although the mode of communication would doubtless have been doleful or joyous , according to the party and religion of the news-bearer .</p>
   <p>PROLOGUES</p>
   <p>AND</p>
   <p>EPILOGUES .</p>
   <p>PROLOGUES AND EPILOGUES .</p>
   <p>The prologue of the English drama was originally , like that of the ancients , merely a kind of argument of the play , instructing the audience concerning those particulars of the plot , which were necessary in order to understand the opening of the piece . That this might be done more artificially , it was often spoken in the character of some person connected with the preceding history of the intrigue , though not properly one of the dramatis personæ . But when increasing refinement introduced the present mode of opening the action in the course of the play itself , the prologue became a preliminary address to the audience , bespeaking their attention and favour for the piece . The epilogue had always borne this last character , being merely an extension of the ancient “ valete et plaudite ; ” an opportunity seized by the performers , after resigning their mimic characters , to pay their respects to the public in their own , and to solicit its approbation of their exertions . By degrees it assumed a more important shape , and was indulged in descanting upon such popular topics as were likely to interest the audience , even though less immediately connected with the actor 's address of thanks , or the piece they had been performing . Both the prologue and epilogue had assumed their present character so early as the days of Shakespeare and Jonson .</p>
   <p>With the revival of dramatic entertainments , after the Restoration , these addresses were revived also ; and a degree of consequence seems to have been attached to them in that witty age , which they did not possess before , and which has not since been given to them . They were not only used to propitiate the audience ; to apologize for the players , or poet ; or to satirize the follies of the day , which is now their chief purpose ; but they became , during the collision of contending factions , vehicles of political tenets and political sarcasm , which could , at no time , be insinuated with more success , than when clothed in nervous verse , and delivered with all the advantages of elocution to an audience , whose numbers rendered the impression of poetry and eloquence more contagious .</p>
   <p>It is not surprising that Dryden soon obtained a complete and absolute superiority in this style of composition over all who pretended to compete with him . While the harmony of his verse gave that advantage to the speaker , which was wanting in the harsh , coarse , broken measure of his contemporaries , his powers of reasoning and of satire left them as far behind in sense as in sound . This superiority , and the great influence which he had in the management of the theatre , made it usual to invoke his assistance in the case of new plays ; many of which he accordingly furnished either with prologues or epilogues . The players also had recourse to him upon any remarkable occasion ; as , when a new house was opened ; when the theatre was honoured by a visit from the king or duke ; when they played at Oxford , during the public acts ; or , in short , in all cases when an occasional prologue was thought necessary to grace their performance .</p>
   <p>The collection of these pieces , which follows , is far from being the least valuable part of our author 's labours . The variety and richness of fancy which they indicate , is one of Dryden 's most remarkable poetical attributes . Whether the theme be , the youth and inexperience or the age and past services , of the author ; the plainness or magnificence of a new theatre ; the superiority of ancient authors , or the exaltation of the moderns ; the censure of political faction , or of fashionable follies ; the praise of the monarch , or the ridicule of the administration ; the poet never fails to treat it with the liveliness appropriate to verses intended to be spoken , and spoken before a numerous assembly . The manner which Dryden assumes , varies also with the nature of his audience . The prologues and epilogues , intended for the London stage , are written in a tone of superiority , as if the poet , conscious of the justice of his own laws of criticism , rather imposed them upon the public as absolute and undeniable , than as standing in need of their ratification . And if he sometimes condescends to solicit , in a more humble style , the approbation of the audience , and to state circumstances of apology , and pleas of favour , it is only in the case of other poets ; for , in the prologues of his own plays , he always rather demands than begs their applause ; and if he acknowledges any defects in the piece , he takes care to intimate , that they are introduced in compliance with the evil taste of the age ; and that the audience must take the blame to themselves , instead of throwing it upon the writer . This bold , style of address , although it occasionally drew upon our author the charge of presumption , was , nevertheless , so well supported by his perception of what was just in criticism , and his powers of defending even what was actually wrong , that a miscellaneous audience was , in general , fain to submit to a domination , as successfully supported as boldly claimed . In the Oxford prologues , on the other hand , the audience furnished by that seat of the Muses , as of more competent judgment , are addressed with more respectful deference by the poet .<span corresp="#note330" type="note_anchor">[ 330 ]</span>He seems , in these , to lay down his rules of criticism , as it were under correction of superior judges ; and intermingles them with such compliments to the taste and learning of the members of the university , as he disdains to bestow upon the motley audience of the metropolis . In one style , the author seems dictating to scholars , whose conceit and presumption must be lowered by censure , to make them sensible of their own deficiencies , and induce them to receive the offered instruction ; in the other , he seems to deliver his opinions before men , whom he acknowledges as his equals , if not his superiors , in the arts of which he is treating . And although Brown has very grossly charged Dryden with having affected , for the university , an esteem and respect , which he was far from really feeling ; and with having exposed its members , in their turn , to the ridicule of the London audience , whom he had stigmatized in his Oxford prologues as void of taste and judgment ; it is but fair to state , that nothing can be produced in proof of such an accusation .<span corresp="#note331" type="note_anchor">[ 331 ]</span>In another respect , the reader may remark a pleasing difference between the London prologues and epilogues , and those spoken at Oxford . The licence of the times permitted , and even exacted from an author , in these compositions , the indulgence of an indelicate vein of humour ; which , however humiliating , is , in general , successful in a vulgar or mixed audience , as turning upon subjects adapted to the meanest capacity . This continued even down to our times ; for , till very lately , it was expected by the mobbish part of the audience , that they should be indemnified for the patience with which they had listened to the moral lessons of a tragedy , by the indecency of the epilogue . In Dryden 's time , this coarse raillery was carried to great excess ; but our author , however culpable in other compositions , is , generally speaking , more correct than his contemporaries in his prologues and epilogues . In the Oxford pieces , particularly , where the decorum of manners , suited to that mother of learning , required him to abstain from all licentious allusion , Dryden has given some excellent specimens of how little he needed to rely upon this obvious and vulgar aid , for the amusement of his audience . Upon the whole , it will be difficult to find pieces of this occasional nature so interesting and unexceptionable as those spoken at Oxford . They are , as they ought to be , by far the most laboured and correct which our author gave to the stage . It may not be improper to add , that the players were only permitted to visit Oxford during the Public Acts , which were frequently celebrated on occasions of public rejoicing . They acted , it would appear , in a Tennis-court , fitted up as an occasional theatre ; and the prologues and epilogues of Dryden tended doubtless greatly to conciliate the favour of an audience , consisting of all that was learned in the generation then mature , and all that was hopeful in that which was rising to succeed it .</p>
   <p>The more miscellaneous prologues and epilogues of Dryden are not without interest . In ridiculing the vices or follies of the age , they often touch upon circumstances illustrative of manners ; and certainly , though the modern theatres of the metropolis are so ill regulated , as nearly to exclude modest females from all the house , except the private boxes , their decorum is superior to that of their predecessors . If we conceive the boxes filled with women , whose masks levelled all distinction between the woman of fashion and the courtezan ; the galleries crowded with a rabble , more ferocious and ignorant than its present inmates ; the pit occupied by drunken bullies , whose quarrels perpetually interrupted the performers , and often ended in bloodshed , and even murder , upon the spot ; we shall have occasion to congratulate ourselves upon being at least in the way of reformation . These enormities of his time , Dryden has pointed out , and censured in his strong and nervous satire . It is to be regretted , that his painting is often coarse , and sometimes intentionally licentious ; although , as has been already observed , more seldom so than that of most of his contemporaries . The historical antiquary may also glean some observations on the state of parties , from those pieces which turn upon the politics of the day ; and there occur numerous hints , which may be useful to an historian of the drama . Thus the Prologues and Epilogues form no improper supplement to Dryden 's historical poetry .</p>
   <p>It remains to say , that all these prologues and epilogues were , according to the custom of that time , printed on single leaves , or broadsides , as they are called , and sold by the hawkers at the door of the theatres . Some of these , but very few , have been preserved by Mr Luttrell , in the collection belonging to Mr Bindley . If a set of them existed , I think it probable they would be found to contain many variations from those editions , which the more mature reflection of the author gave to the world in the Miscellanies . But the loss is the less to be lamented , as , in general , the original editions which I have seen are not only more inaccurate , but coarser and more licentious , than those which Dryden finally adopted . In the original prologue of Circe , which is printed in this edition , for example , the reader will find , that , in place of the well-known apology for an author 's first production , by an appeal to those of Shakespeare , Fletcher , and Jonson , his youth is only made the subject of some commonplace raillery . Indeed , so little value did Dryden himself set upon these occasional effusions before they were collected , and so little did he consider them as entitled to live in the recollection of the public , that , on one occasion at least , but probably upon several , he actually transferred the same prologue from one new play to another . Thus he reclaimed , from his adversary Shadwell 's play of “ The True Widow , ” the prologue which he had furnished , and affixed it to the “ Widow Ranter ” of Mrs Behn . Sometimes also he laid under contribution former publications of his own , which he supposed to be forgotten , in order to furnish out one of these theatrical prefaces . Thus the satire against the Dutch furnishes the principal part of the prologue and epilogue to “ Amboyna . ”</p>
   <p>Inaccurate as they seem to have been , the original editions might have proved useful in arranging the prologues and epilogues according to their exact dates , which , where they are not attached to any particular play , can now only be assigned from internal evidence . But absolute accuracy in this point , though no doubt desirable if it can be obtained , does not appear to be a point of any serious moment ; and , after having bestowed considerable pains , the Editor will neither be much ashamed , nor inconsolably sorry , to find , that some of the prologues and epilogues have been misplaced in the order which he has adopted .</p>

From this beginning I naturally fall a railing at London , with as much zeal as a Buckingham-shire grazier , who had his pocket picked at a Smithfield entertainment ; or a country lady , whose obsequious knight has spent his estate among misses , vintners , and linen-drapers ; and then I tell my audience , that a man may walk farther in the city to meet a true judge of poetry , than ride his horse on Salisbury Plain to find a house .</p>

    <head>THE FIRST DAY OF THE KING 'S HOUSE ACTING AFTER THE FIRE .</head>
    <head>In January , 1671-2 , the play-house in Drury-Lane , occupied by the King 's company , took fire , and was entirely destroyed , with fifty or sixty adjoining houses , which were either involved in the conflagration , or blown up to stop its progress . During the rebuilding of this theatre , the King 's servants acted in the old house in Lincoln'shYpppHeNInnhYpppHeNFields . The following Prologue announces the distressed situation of the company on their retreat to this temporary asylum . The sixth couplet alludes to the recent desertion of the Lincoln'shYpppHeNInn theatre , by the rival company , called the Duke 's , who were now acting at one in Dorset Gardens , splendidly fitted up under the direction of Sir William D'Avenant .</head>

    <p>PROLOGUE</p>
    <p>FOR</p>
    <p>THE WOMEN , WHEN THEY ACTED AT THE OLD THEATRE , LINCOLN'ShYpppHeNINNhYpppHeNFIELDS .</p>
    <p>Female performers were first introduced after the Restoration . They became speedily acceptable to the court and the public . The dramatic poets were in so many ways indebted to them , that occasional exertions , dedicated to their benefit , as I presume the following to have been , were but a suitable return for various favours received . Our author 's intimacy with the beautiful Mrs Reeves particularly called forth his talents in behalf of these damsels , distressed as they must have been by the unlucky burning of the theatre in Drury-Lane . The Prologue occurs in the Miscellanies ; but is , I know not why , omitted by Derrick in his edition of Dryden 's poems .</p>
     <l n="1">Were none of you , gallants , e'er driven so hard ,</l>
     <l n="2">As when the poor kind soul was under guard ,</l>

     <l n="4">To take a lodging , and in private meet ?</l>
     <l n="5">Such is our case ; we can n't appoint our house ,</l>
     <l n="6">The lovers ’ old and wonted rendezvous ,</l>
     <l n="7">But hither to this trusty nook remove ;</l>
     <l n="8">The worse the lodging is , the more the love .</l>
     <l n="9">For much good pastime , many a dear sweet hug ,</l>
     <l n="10">Is stolen in garrets , on the humble rug .</l>
     <l n="11">Here 's good accommodation in the pit ;</l>
     <l n="12">The grave demurely in the midst may sit ,</l>
     <l n="13">And so the hot Burgundian<span corresp="#note333" type="note_anchor">[ 333 ]</span>on the side ,</l>

    <p>PROLOGUE</p>
    <p>SPOKEN AT</p>
    <p>THE OPENING OF THE NEW HOUSE ,</p>
    <p>MARCH 26 , 1674 .</p>
    <p>The Drury-Lane theatre , after being burned in 1671-2 , was rebuilt upon a plan furnished by Sir Christopher Wren , who superintended the execution . It is said to have been most admirably planned , but spoiled by some injudicious alterations in the course of building . The following Prologue informs us , that the exterior decorations were plain and simple in comparison to those of the rival house in Dorset Gardens , which , as repeatedly noticed , had been splendidly fitted up under the direction of D'Avenant , noted for his attachment to stage pomp and shew . It appears that Charles II ., who was possessed of considerable taste , and did not disdain to interest himself in the affairs of the drama , had himself recommended to the King 's company , the simplicity and frugality of scenery and ornament to which the poet alludes . The other house were not unapt to boast of the superior splendour which is here conceded to them . In the epilogue to “ Psyche ” the actors boast ,</p>
     <l n="1">—— Gallants , you can tell ,</l>
     <l n="2">No foreign stage can ours in pomp excel ;</l>
     <l n="3">And here none e'er shall treat you half so well .</l>
     <l n="4">Poor players have this day such splendour shown ,</l>
     <l n="5">Which yet but by great monarchs has been done .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>D'Avenant , by whom the Duke 's company were long directed , was the first who introduced regular scenery upon a public stage . His drama of the “ Siege of Rhodes ” seems to have been the first exhibited with these decorations .— See MALONE 'S Account of the English Stage . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">A plain-built house , after so long a stay ,</l>
     <l n="2">Will send you half unsatisfied away ;</l>
     <l n="3">When , fallen from your expected pomp , you find</l>
     <l n="4">A bare convenience only is designed .</l>
     <l n="5">You , who each day can theatres behold ,</l>
     <l n="6">Like Nero 's palace , shining all with gold ,</l>
     <l n="7">Our mean ungilded stage will scorn , we fear ,</l>
     <l n="8">And , for the homely room , disdain the chear .</l>
     <l n="9">Yet now cheap druggets to a mode are grown , }</l>
     <l n="10">And a plain suit , since we can make but one , }</l>
     <l n="11">Is better than to be by tarnished gawdry known . }</l>
     <l n="12">They , who are by your favours wealthy made ,</l>
     <l n="13">With mighty sums may carry on the trade ;</l>
     <l n="14">We , broken bankers , half destroyed by fire , }</l>
     <l n="15">With our small stock to humble roofs retire ;}</l>
     <l n="16">Pity our loss , while you their pomp admire . }</l>
     <l n="17">For fame and honour we no longer strive ;</l>
     <l n="18">We yield in both , and only beg — to live ;</l>
     <l n="19">Unable to support their vast expence ,</l>
     <l n="20">Who build and treat with such magnificence ,</l>
     <l n="21">That , like the ambitious monarchs of the age ,</l>
     <l n="22">They give the law to our provincial stage .</l>
     <l n="23">Great neighbours enviously promote excess ,</l>
     <l n="24">While they impose their splendour on the less ;</l>
     <l n="25">But only fools , and they of vast estate , }</l>
     <l n="26">The extremity of modes will imitate , }</l>
     <l n="27">The dangling knee-fringe , and the bib-cravat ,}</l>
     <l n="28">Yet if some pride with want may be allowed ,</l>
     <l n="29">We in our plainness may be justly proud ;</l>
     <l n="30">Our Royal Master willed it should be so ;</l>
     <l n="31">Whate'er he 's pleased to own , can need no show :</l>
     <l n="32">That sacred name gives ornament and grace ,</l>
     <l n="33">And , like his stamp , makes basest metal pass .</l>
     <l n="34">‘ Twere folly now a stately pile to raise ,</l>
     <l n="35">To build a playhouse while you throw down plays ;</l>
     <l n="36">While scenes , machines , and empty operas reign ,</l>
     <l n="37">And for the pencil you the pen disdain ;</l>
     <l n="38">While troops of famished Frenchmen hither drive ,</l>
     <l n="39">And laugh at those upon whose alms they live :</l>
     <l n="40">Old English authors vanish , and give place</l>
     <l n="41">To these new conquerors of the Norman race .</l>
     <l n="42">More tamely than your fathers you submit ;</l>
     <l n="43">You 're now grown vassals to them in your wit .</l>
     <l n="44">Mark , when they play , how our fine fops advance }</l>
     <l n="45">The mighty merits of their men of France , }</l>
     <l n="46">Keep time , cry , Bon ! and humour the cadence . }</l>
     <l n="47">Well , please yourselves ; but sure ‘ tis understood ,</l>
     <l n="48">That French machines have ne'er done England good .<span corresp="#note335" type="note_anchor">[ 335 ]</span></l>
     <l n="49">I would not prophecy our house 's fate ;</l>
     <l n="50">But while vain shows and scenes you over-rate ,</l>
     <l n="51">‘ Tis to be feared ——</l>
     <l n="52">That , as a fire the former house o'erthrew ,</l>
     <l n="53">Machines and tempests<span corresp="#note336" type="note_anchor">[ 336 ]</span>will destroy the new .</l>

Shadwell had also , about this time , produced his opera of “ Psyche , ” which , with the “ Tempest ” and other pieces depending chiefly upon shew and scenery , were acting in Dorset-Garden , when this Prologue was written . In order to ridicule these splendid exhibitions , the company at Drury-Lane brought forward parodies on them , such as the “ Mock Tempest , ” “ Psyche Debauched , ” &amp; c.

    <head>Hart , who had been a captain in the civil wars , belonged to the King 's company . He was an excellent actor , and particularly celebrated in the character of Othello . He left the stage , according to Cibber , on the union of the companies in 1686 . But it appears from a paper published in a note on the article “ Betterton ” in the Biographia , that he retired in 1681 , upon receiving a pension from Dr D'Avenant , then manager of the Duke 's company , who in this manner bought off both Hart and Kynaston , and greatly weakened the opposite set .</head>

    <head>EPILOGUE</head>
    <head>SPOKEN</head>
    <head>AT OXFORD , BY MRS MARSHALL .</head>
    <head>The date of this Epilogue is fixed by that of Bathurst 's vice-chancellorship , which lasted from 3d October , 1673 , to 9th October 1675 .</head>
     <l n="1">Oft has our poet wished , this happy seat</l>
     <l n="2">Might prove his fading muse 's last retreat :</l>
     <l n="3">I wondered at his wish , but now I find</l>

     <l n="5">Which noiseful towns , and courts , can never know ,</l>
     <l n="6">And only in the shades , like laurels , grow .</l>

     <l n="13">‘ Tis all we can return for favours past ,</l>
     <l n="14">Whose holy memory shall ever last ,</l>

   <note xml:id="note342" place="bottom" n="342">Ralph Bathurst , thus highly distinguished by our author , was a distinguished character of the age . He was uncle to Allen , the first Lord Bathurst . He was born in 1620 , and bred to the church , but abandoned divinity for the pursuit of medicine , which he practised until the Restoration , when he resumed his clerical character . In 1663 he became head of Trinity college , Oxford , into the court and chapel of which he introduced the beauties of classical architecture , to rival , if it were possible , the magnificence of the Gothic edifices by which it is surrounded . In 1673 , he had the honour to be appointed vice-chancellor ; an office which he retained for two years . During his execution of this duty he is said to have reformed many abuses which had crept into the university ; and by liberal benefactions added considerably to the prosperity of literature . Anthony Wood , who had some private reason for disliking him , and who , moreover , was as determined an enemy to the fair sex as ever harboured in a cloister , picked a quarrel with Bathurst 's wife , as he could find no reasonable fault with the vice-chancellor himself . “ Dr Bathurst took his place of vice-chancellor ; a man of good parts , and able to do good things ; but he has a wife that scorns that he should be in print ; a scornful woman ! scorns that he was dean of Wells : no need of marrying such a woman , who is so conceited , that she thinks herself fit to govern a college , or university . ” — Perhaps the countenance given by Bathurst to the theatre , for which Dryden here expresses his gratitude , might not tend to conciliate the good will of Anthony , who quarrelled with his sister-in-law by refusing to treat her to the play . But it agreed well with the character of Bathurst , who was not only a patron of literature in all its branches , but himself an excellent Latin poet , as his verses prefixed to Hobbes ’ “ Leviathan , ” fully testify ; and as good an English poet as most of his contemporaries . He died in his eighty-fourth year , 1704 . Warton has given us the following character of his Latin compositions , for which Dryden has celebrated him so highly : “ His Latin orations are wonderful specimens of wit and antithesis , which were the delight of his age . They want , upon the whole , the purity and simplicity of Tully 's eloquence , but even exceed the sententious smartness of Seneca , and the surprising turns of Pliny . They are perpetually spirited , and discover an uncommon quickness of thought . The manner is concise and abrupt , but yet perspicuous and easy : His allusions are delicate , and his observations sensible and animated ; his sentiments of congratulation , or indignation , are equally forcible : his compliments are most elegantly turned , and his satire is most ingeniously severe . These compositions are extremely agreeable to read , but , in the present improvement of classical taste , not so proper to be imitated . ” — Life of Bathurst , prefixed to his Literary Remains , published under the inspection of Mr Warton .</note>

    <head>PROLOGUE TO CIRCE ,</head>
    <head>BY</head>
    <head>DR CHARLES D'AVENANT , 1675 .</head>
    <head>Dr Charles D'Avenant , the author of “ Circe , ” was son of the Rare Sir William D'Avenant , whom he succeeded as manager of the Duke 's company . He practised physic in Doctor 's Commons , which he afterwards abandoned for politics . He became a member of Parliament , and inspector of the exports and imports , of which office he died possessed in 1714 . He wrote many tracts upon political subjects , especially those connected with the revenue . “ Circe , ” his only drama , is an opera , to which Bannister composed the music . Besides the Prologue by our author , it was honoured by an Epilogue by the famous Rochester , and thus graced was received favourably . It contains some good writing , considering it was composed at the age of nineteen ; a circumstance alluded to in the following Prologue . The original Prologue is from the 4to edition of “ Circe , ” London , 1677 . It was afterwards much improved , or rather entirely re-written , by our author .</head>

   <p>EPILOGUE</p>
   <p>INTENDED TO HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY</p>
   <p>THE LADY HEN . MAR . WENTWORTH .</p>
   <p>WHEN CALISTO WAS ACTED AT COURT , IN 1675 .</p>
   <p>“ Calisto , or the Chaste Nymph , ” was a masque written by John Crowne , who , by the interference of Rochester , was employed to compose such an entertainment to be exhibited at court , though this was an encroachment on the office of Dryden , the poet laureat . The principal characters were represented by the daughters of the Duke of York , and the first nobility . The Lady Mary , afterwards Queen , to whom the masque was dedicated , acted Calisto ; Nyphe was represented by the Lady Anne , who also succeeded to the throne ; Jupiter , by Lady Harriot Wentworth ; Psecas , by Lady Mary Mordaunt ; Diana , by Mrs Blague , and Mercury by Mrs Sarah Jennings , afterwards Duchess of Marlborough . Among the attendant nymphs and dancers were the Countesses of Pembroke and of Derby , Lady Catharine Herbert , Mrs Fitzgerald , and Mrs Fraser . The male dancers were the Duke of Monmouth , Viscount Dunblaine , Lord Daincourt , and others of the first quality . Although the exhibition of this masque , which it was the privilege of his office to have written , must have been somewhat galling to Dryden , we see that he so far suppressed his feelings as to compose the following Epilogue , which , to his farther mortification , was rejected , through the interference of Rochester .</p>
   <p>The Lady Henrietta Maria Wentworth , Baroness of Nettlested , who acted the part of Jupiter on the present occasion , afterwards adapted her conduct to that of Calisto , and became the mistress of the Duke of Monmouth . He was so passionately attached to her , that upon the scaffold he vindicated their intercourse by some very warm and enthusiastic expressions , and could by no means be prevailed on to express any repentance of it as unlawful . This lady died about a year after the execution of her unfortunate lover , in 1685 . Her mother , Lady Wentworth , ordered a monument of L. 2000 value to be erected over her in the church of Teddington , Bedfordshire .</p>

    <head>EPILOGUE</head>
    <head>TO THE</head>
    <head>MAN OF MODE ; OR SIR FOPLING FLUTTER .</head>
    <head>BY</head>
    <head>SIR GEORGE ETHEREGE , 1676 .</head>
    <head>This play , which long maintained a high degree of reputation on the stage , presents us with the truest picture of what was esteemed good breeding and wit in the reign of Charles II . All the characters , from Dorimant down to the Shoemaker , were either really drawn from the life , or depicted so accurately according to the manners of the times , that each was instantly ascribed to some individual . Sir Fopling Flutter , in particular , was supposed to represent Sir George Hewit , mentioned in the Essay on Satire , and who seems to have been one of the most choice coxcombs of the period . A very severe criticism in the Spectator , pointing out the coarseness as well as the immorality of this celebrated performance , had a great effect in diminishing its popularity . The satire being in fact personal , it followed as a matter of course , that the Prologue should disclaim all personality , that being an attribute to be discovered by the audience , but not avowed by the poet . Dryden has accomplished this with much liveliness , and enumerates for our edification the special fopperies which went to make up a complete fine gentleman in 1676 — differing only in form from those required in 1806 , excepting that the ancient beau needed , to complete his character , a slight sprinkling of literary accomplishment , which the modern has discarded with the “ sacred periwig . ”</head>
     <l n="1">Most modern wits such monstrous fools have shown ,</l>
     <l n="2">They seem not of heaven 's making , but their own .</l>
     <l n="3">Those nauseous Harlequins in farce may pass ;</l>
     <l n="4">But there goes more to a substantial ass :</l>
     <l n="5">Something of man must be exposed to view ,</l>
     <l n="6">That , gallants , they may more resemble you .</l>
     <l n="7">Sir Fopling is a fool so nicely writ ,</l>
     <l n="8">The ladies would mistake him for a wit ;</l>
     <l n="9">And , when he sings , talks loud , and cocks , would cry ,</l>
     <l n="10">I vow , methinks , he 's pretty company !</l>
     <l n="11">So brisk , so gay , so travelled , so refined ,</l>
     <l n="12">As he took pains to graff upon his kind .</l>
     <l n="13">True fops help nature 's work , and go to school ,</l>
     <l n="14">To file and finish God Almighty 's fool .</l>
     <l n="15">Yet none Sir Fopling him , or him can call ;</l>
     <l n="16">He 's knight o ’ the shire , and represents ye all .</l>
     <l n="17">From each he meets he culls whate'er he can ;</l>
     <l n="18">Legion 's his name , a people in a man .</l>
     <l n="19">His bulky folly gathers as it goes ,</l>
     <l n="20">And , rolling o'er you , like a snow-ball , grows .</l>
     <l n="21">His various modes from various fathers follow ;</l>
     <l n="22">One taught the toss , and one the new French wallow ;</l>
     <l n="23">His sword-knot this , his cravat that designed ;</l>
     <l n="24">And this the yard-long snake he twirls behind .</l>
     <l n="25">From one the sacred periwig he gained ,</l>
     <l n="26">Which wind ne'er blew , nor touch of hat profaned .</l>
     <l n="27">Another 's diving bow he did adore ,</l>
     <l n="28">Which with a shog casts all the hair before ,</l>
     <l n="29">Till he , with full decorum , brings it back ,</l>
     <l n="30">And rises with a water-spaniel shake .</l>
     <l n="31">As for his songs , the ladies ’ dear delight ,</l>
     <l n="32">These sure he took from most of you who write .</l>
     <l n="33">Yet every man is safe from what he feared ;</l>

    <head>This , as appears from the Prologue preserved in the Luttrell collection , was the first play acted in the season , 1698-9 . It has , like all Lee 's productions , no small share of bombast , with some strikingly beautiful passages .</head>

   <p>PROLOGUE</p>
   <p>TO</p>
   <p>THE TRUE WIDOW , 1679 .</p>
   <p>At this period Shadwell and our author were on such good terms , that Dryden obliged him with the following Prologue to the “ True Widow ; ” a play intended to display the humours of various men of the town . Thus we have in the Dramatis Personæ ,—</p>
   <p>“ Selfish . A coxcomb , conceited of his beauty , wit , and breeding , thinking all women in love with him , always admiring and talking to himself .</p>
   <p>Old Maggot . An old , credulous fellow ; a great enemy to wit , and a lover of business for business-sake .</p>
   <p>Young Maggot . His nephew : an inns-of-court man , who neglects law , and runs mad after wit , pretending much to love , and both in spite of nature , since his face makes him unfit for one , and his brains for the other .</p>
   <p>Prig . A coxcomb , who never thinks or talks of any thing but dogs , horses , hunting , hawking , bowls , tennis , and gaming ; a rook , a most noisy jockey .</p>
   <p>Lump . A methodical coxcomb , as regular as a clock , and goes as true as a pendulum ; one that knows what he shall do every day of his life by his almanack , where he sets down all his actions before-hand ; a mortal enemy to wit . ”</p>
   <p>So many characters , so minutely described , lead us to suppose , that some personal satire lay concealed under them ; and , accordingly , the Prologue seems to have been written with a view of deprecating the resentment which this idea might have excited in the audience . We learn , however , by the Preface , that the piece was unfavourably received , “ either through the calamity of the time ( during the Popish plot ) , which made people not care for diversions , or through the anger of a great many who thought themselves concerned in the satire . ” The piece is far from being devoid of merit ; and the characters , though drawn in Shadwell 's coarse , harsh manner , are truly comic . That of the jockey , since so popular , seems to have been brought upon the stage for the first time in the “ True Widow . ” It is remarkable , that , though Dryden writes the Prologue , the piece contains a sly hit at him . Maggot , finding himself married to a portionless jilt , says , “ I must e'en write hard for the play-house ; I may get the reversion of the poet-laureat 's place . ” This , however , might be only meant as a good-humoured pleasantry among friends .</p>
   <p>After the deadly quarrel with Shadwell , our author seems to have resumed his property in the Prologue , as it is prefixed to “ The Widow Ranter , or The History of Bacon in Virginia , ” a tragi-comedy by Mrs Behn , acted in 1690 .</p>

    <p>PROLOGUE</p>
    <p>TO</p>
    <p>CÆSAR BORGIA .</p>
    <p>BY MR N. LEE , 1680 .</p>
    <p>This play of Nathaniel Lee 's was first acted at the Duke 's theatre , in 1680 . It is founded on the history of the natural son of Pope Alexander VI . The play fell soon into disrepute ; for Cibber tells us , that when Powel was jealous of his fine dress in Lord Foppington , and complained bitterly , that he had not so good a suit to play “ Cæsar Borgia , ” this bouncing play could do little more than pay candles and fiddles .— Apology .</p>
     <l n="1">The unhappy man , who once has trailed a pen ,</l>
     <l n="2">Lives not to please himself , but other men ;</l>
     <l n="3">Is always drudging , wastes his life and blood ,</l>

   <note xml:id="note351" place="bottom" n="351">In Dryden 's days , as in our own , there were provided by the hawkers a plentiful assortment of wonders and prodigies to captivate the people ; with this difference , that , in that earlier period , the readers and believers of these wonders were more numerous , and of higher rank . I cannot point out the particular prodigies referred to ; but I suppose they were of the same description as “ The wonderful blazing star ; with the dreadful apparition of two armies in the air ; the one out of the north , the other out of the south , seen on the 17th December , 1680 , betwixt four and five o'clock in the evening , at Ottery , ten miles eastward of Exon ; ” or as “ The strange and dreadful relation of a horrible tempest of thunder and lightning , and of strange apparitions in the air , accompanied with whirlwinds , gusts of hail and rain , which happened the 10th of June , 1680 , at a place near Weatherby , in the county of York : with the account how the top of strong oak , containing one load of wood , was taken off by a sheet of fire , wrapped in a whirlwind , and carried through the air , half a mile distant from the place , &amp; c. As , likewise , another strange relation of a monstrous child with two heads , four arms , four legs , and all things thereunto belonging ; born at a village , called Ill-Brewers , in the county of Somerset , on the 19th of May last , with several other circumstances and curious observations , to the wonder of all that have beheld it . ”</note>
   <note xml:id="note352" place="bottom" n="352">The court of Requests was a general rendezvous for the news-mongers , politicians , and busy bodies of the time . North says , “ It was observable of Oates , that while he had his liberty , as in King Charles 's time and King William 's , especially the latter , he never failed to give his attendance in the court of Requests , and in the lobbies , to solicit hard in all points under deliberation that might terminate in the prejudice of the church , crown , or of any gentlemen of the loyal , or church of England party . ” Swift , in his journal to Stella , makes frequent mention of the Court of Requests as a scene of political bustle and intrigue .</note>

     <l n="1">1680 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Sophonisba was play of N. Lee , first acted about 1676 . It is in the taste of the French stage , and of the romances of Calprenede and Scuderi . Hannibal and Massinissa are introduced in the character of whining love-sick adorers of relentless beauty . This prevailing taste is admirably ridiculed by Boileau , in a dialogue where a scene is laid in the infernal regions . In the prologue spoken at Oxford , which was always famous for Tory principles , our author ventures to ridicule the Popish Plot , and to predict the consequences of the predominance of fanatical principles to the studies cultivated in the University .</p>

    <p>EPILOGUE</p>
    <p>TO A</p>
    <p>TRAGEDY CALLED TAMERLANE , 1681 .</p>
    <p>BY CHARLES SAUNDERS .</p>
    <p>This play was highly applauded at its first representation . Langbaine , following perhaps this epilogue , tells us , that the genius of the author budded as early as that of the incomparable Cowley ; and adds , in evidence of farther sympathy , that Saunders was , like him , a king 's scholar . The play is said to be taken from a novel called “ Tamerlane and Asteria , ” and was complimented with a copy of commendatory verses by Mr Banks . It does not appear that Saunders wrote any thing else .</p>

    <p>PROLOGUE</p>
    <p>TO THE</p>
    <p>UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD .</p>
    <p>This Prologue must have been spoken at Oxford during the residence of the Duke of York in Scotland , in 1681-2 . The humour turns upon a part of the company having attended the Duke to Scotland , where , among other luxuries little known to my countrymen , he introduced , during his residence at Holy Rood House , the amusements of the theatre . I can say little about the actors commemorated in the following verses , excepting , that their stage was erected in the tennis-court of the palace , which was afterwards converted into some sort of manufactory , and finally , burned down many years ago . Besides these deserters , whom Dryden has described very ludicrously , he mentions a sort of strolling company , composed , it would seem , of Irishmen , who had lately acted at Oxford .</p>
     <l n="1">Discord , and plots , which have undone our age ,</l>
     <l n="2">With the same ruin have o'erwhelmed the stage .</l>
     <l n="3">Our house has suffered in the common woe ,</l>
     <l n="4">We have been troubled with Scotch rebels too .</l>
     <l n="5">Our brethren are from Thames to Tweed departed , }</l>
     <l n="6">And of our sisters , all the kinder-hearted }</l>
     <l n="7">To Edinburgh gone , or coached , or carted . }</l>
     <l n="8">With bonny bluecap there they act all night</l>
     <l n="9">For Scotch half-crown , in English three-pence hight .</l>
     <l n="10">One nymph , to whom fat Sir John Falstaff 's lean ,</l>
     <l n="11">There with her single person fills the scene .</l>
     <l n="12">Another , with long use and age decayed ,</l>
     <l n="13">Dived here old woman , and rose there a maid .</l>
     <l n="14">Our trusty door-keepers of former time</l>
     <l n="15">There strut and swagger in heroic rhime .</l>
     <l n="16">Tack but a copper-lace to drugget suit ,</l>
     <l n="17">And there 's a hero made without dispute ;</l>
     <l n="18">And that , which was a capon 's tail before ,</l>
     <l n="19">Becomes a plume for Indian emperor .</l>
     <l n="20">But all his subjects , to express the care</l>
     <l n="21">Of imitation go , like Indians , bare ;</l>

In his “ Strange and wonderful prophecy , being a relation of many universal accidents that will come to pass in the year 1681 , according to the prognostications of the celestial bodies , as well in this our English nation , as in parts beyond the seas , with a sober caution to all , by speedy repentance , to avert the judgments that are impendent , ” I find “ an account of the great stream of light , by some termed a blazing star , which was seen in the south-west on Saturday and Sunday , the 11th and 12th of this instant December , between six and seven in the evening , with several judicial opinions and conjectures on the same . ” But the comet , mentioned in the text , may be that which is noticed in “ A strange and wonderful Trinity , or a Triplicity of Stupendous Prodigies , consisting of a wonderful eclipse , as well as of a wonderful comet , and of a wonderful conjunction , now in its second return ; seeing all these three prodigious wonders do jointly portend wonderful events , all meeting together in a strange harmonious triangle , and are all the three royal heralds successively sent from the King of Heaven , to sound succeeding alarms for awakening a slumbering world . Beware the third time . ” 4to . London , 1683 . This comet is said to have appeared in October 1682 . Various interpretations were put upon these heavenly phenomena , by Gadbury , Lilly , Kirkby , Whalley , and other Philo-maths , who were chiefly guided in their predictions by their political attachments . Some insisted they meant civil war , others foreign conquest ; some that they presaged the downfall of the Turk , others that of the Pope and French king ; some that they foretold dearth on the land , and others , the fertility of the king 's bed , by the birth of a son , to the exclusion of the Duke of York .</note>
   <note xml:id="note367" place="bottom" n="367">This was one of the numerous devices used by the partizans of Monmouth to strengthen his interest : “ A relation was published , in the name of one Elizabeth Freeman , afterwards called the Maid of Hatfield , setting forth , That , on the 24th of January , the appearance of a woman all in white , with a white veil over her face , accosted her with these words : ‘ Sweetheart , the 15th day of May is appointed for the royal blood to be poisoned . Be not afraid , for I am sent to tell thee . ’ That on the 25th , the same appearance stood before her again , and she having then acquired courage enough to lay it under the usual adjuration , in the name , &amp; c. it assumed a more glorious shape , and said in a harsher tone of voice : ‘ Tell King Charles from me , and bid him not remove his parliament , and stand to his council : ’ adding , ‘ do as I bid you . ’ That on the 26th it appeared to her a third time , but said only , ‘ do your message . ’ And that on the next night , when she saw it for the last time , it said nothing at all .</note>
   <p>“ Those who depend upon the people for support , must try all manners of practices upon them ; and such fooleries as these sometimes operate more forcibly than expedients of a more rational kind . Care was , besides , taken , to have this relation attested by Sir Joseph Jordan , a justice of the peace , and the rector of Hatfield , Dr Lee , who was one of the king 's chaplains : Nay , the message was actually sent to his majesty , and the whole forgery very officiously circulated all over the kingdom . ” — RALPH 'S Review of the Reigns of Charles II . and James II . Vol . I. p. 562 .</p>
   <p>The Tories , according to the custom of that time , endeavoured to turn this apparition against those who invented it , and published an ironical account of its appearance to Lady Gray , the supposed mistress of the Duke of Monmouth .— See RALPH , ibid . and this Work , Vol .

    <head>PROLOGUE</head>
    <head>TO THE</head>
    <head>LOYAL BROTHER , OR THE PERSIAN PRINCE .</head>
    <head>The “ Loyal Brother , or the Persian Prince , ” was the first play of Southerne , afterwards so deservedly famous as a tragic poet . It is said to be borrowed from a novel , called , “ Tachmas , Prince of Persia . ” The character of the Loyal Brother is obviously designed as a compliment to the Duke of York , whose adherents and opponents now divided the nation . Southerne was at this time but three-and-twenty . It is said , that , upon offering Dryden five guineas for the following prologue , which had hitherto been the usual compliment made him for such favours , the bard returned the money ; and added , “ not that I do so out of disrespect to you , young man , but the players have had my goods too cheap . In future , I must have ten guineas . ” Southerne was the first poet who drew large profit from the author 's nights ; insomuch , that he is said to have cleared by one play seven hundred pounds ; a circumstance that greatly surprised Dryden , who seldom gained by his best pieces more than a seventh part of the sum . From these circumstances , Pope , in his verses to Southerne on his birth-day , distinguishes him as</head>
     <l n="1">—— Tom , whom heaven sent down to raise</l>
     <l n="2">The price of prologues and of plays .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The prologue , as might be expected , is very severe upon the Whigs ; and alludes to all the popular subjects of dispute between the factions . The refusal of supplies , and the petition against the king 's guards , are slightly noticed , but the great pope-burning is particularly dwelt upon ; and probably the reader will be pleased with an opportunity of comparing the account in the prologue with that given by Roger North , who seems to have entertained the same fear with Dryden , that the rabble might chuse to cry , God save the king , at Whitehall .</p>
   <p>“ But , to return to our tumults .— After it was found that there was to be a reinforcement at the next anniversary , which was in 1682 , it is not to be thought that the court was asleep , or that the king would not endeavour to put a stop to this brutal outrage . His majesty thought fit to take the ordinary regular course ; which was , to send for the lord mayor , &amp; c. and to charge him to prevent riots in the city . So the lord mayor and sheriffs attended the king in council ; and there they were told , that dangerous tumults and disorders were designed in the city upon the 17th of November next , at night , on pretence of bonfires ; and his majesty expected that they , who were entrusted with the government of the city , for keeping the peace , should , by their authority , prevent all such riotous disorders , which , permitted to go on , was a misdemeanour of their whole body . Then one of them came forward , and , in a whining tone , told the king , that they did not apprehend any danger to his majesty , or the city , from these bonfires ; there was an ardour of the people against popery , which they delighted to express in that manner , but meant no harm : And , if they should go about to hinder them , it would be taken as if they favoured popery ; and , considering the great numbers , and their zeal , it might make them outrageous , which , let alone , would not be ; and perhaps they themselves might not be secure in resisting them , no not in their own houses ; and they hoped his majesty would not have them so exposed , so long as they could assure his majesty that care should be taken , that , if they went about any ill thing , they should be prevented : or to this purpose , as I had it from undoubted authority . This was the godly care they had of the public peace , and the repose of the city ; by which the king saw plainly what they were , and what was to be expected from them . There wanted not those who suggested the sending regiments into the city ; but the king ( always witty ) said , he did not love to play with his horse . But his majesty ordered that a party of horse should be drawn up , and make a strong guard on the outside of Temple-Bar ; and all the other guards were ordered to be in a posture at a minute 's warning ; and so he took a middle , but secure and inoffensive way ; and these guards did not break up till all the rout was over .</p>
   <p>“ There were not a few in the court who either feared or favoured these doings ; it may be both ; the former being the cause of the latter . This puts me in mind of a passage told me by one present . It was of the Lord Archbishop of York , Dolben , who was a goodly person , and corpulent ; he came to the Lord Chief-Justice North , and , my lord , said he , ( clapping his hand upon his great self ,) what shall we do with these tumults of the people ? They will bear all down before them . My lord , said the Chief Justice , fear God , and do n't fear the people . A good hint from a man of law to an archbishop . But when the day of execution was come , all the show-fools of the town had made sure of places ; and , towards the evening , there was a great clutter in the street , with taking down glass-windows , and faces began to show themselves thereat ; and the hubbub was great , with the shoals of people come there , to take or seek accommodation . And , for the greater amazement of the people , somebody had got up to the statue of Elizabeth , in the nich of Temple-Bar , and set her out like an heathen idol . A bright shield was hung upon her arm , and a spear put in , or leaned upon , the other hand ; and lamps , or candles , were put about , on the wall of the nich , to enlighten her person , that the people might have a full view of the deity that , like the goddess Pallas , stood there as the object of the solemn sacrifice about to be made . There seemed to be an inscription upon the shield , but I could not get near enough to discern what it was , nor divers other decorations ; but whatever they were , the eyes of the rout were pointed at them , and lusty shouts were raised , which was all the adoration could be paid before the grand procession came up . I could fix in no nearer post than the Green-Dragon Tavern , below in Fleet-Street ; but , before I settled in my quarters , I rounded the crowd , to observe , as well as I could , what was doing , and saw much , but afterwards heard more of the hard battles and skirmishes , that were maintained from windows and balconies of several parties with one and the other , and with the floor , as the fancy of Whig and Tory incited . All which were managed with the artillery of squibs , whereof thousands of vollies went off , to the great expence of powder and paper , and profit to the poor manufacturer ; for the price of ammunition rose continually , and the whole trade could not supply the consumption of an hour or two .</p>
   <p>“ When we had posted ourselves at windows , expecting the play to begin , it was very dark , but we could perceive the street to fill , and the hum of the crowd grew louder and louder ; and , at length , with help of some lights below , we could discern , not only upwards towards the Bar , where the squib war was maintained , but downwards towards Fleet-Bridge , the whole street was crowded with people , which made that which followed seem very strange ; for , about eight at night , we heard a din from below , which came up the street , continually increasing , till we could perceive a motion ; and that was a row of stout fellows , that came , shouldered together , cross the street , from wall to wall , on each side . How the people melted away , I cannot tell ; but it was plain these fellows made clear board , as if they had swept the street for what was to come after . They went along like a wave ; and it was wonderful to see how the crowd made way : I suppose the good people were willing to give obedience to lawful authority . Behind this wave ( which , as all the rest , had many lights attending ) there was a vacancy , but it filled a-pace , till another like wave came up ; and so four or five of these waves passed , one after another ; and then we discerned more numerous lights , and throats were opened with hoarse and tremendous noise ; and , with that , advanced a pageant , borne along above the heads of the crowd , and upon it sat an huge Pope , in pontificalibus , in his chair , with a reasonable attendance for state ; but his premier minister , that shared most of his ear , was , Il Signior Diavolo , a nimble little fellow , in a proper dress , that had a strange dexterity in climbing and winding about the chair , from one of the pope 's ears to the other .</p>
   <p>“ The next pageant was of a parcel of Jesuits ; and after that ( for there was always a decent space between them ) came another , with some ordinary persons with halters , as I took it , about their necks ; and one with a stenterophonic tube , sounded — Abhorrers ! Abhorrers ! most infernally ; and , lastly , came one , with a single person upon it , which , some said , was the pamphleteer Sir Roger L'Estrange , some the King of France , some the Duke of York ; but , certainly , it was a very complaisant civil gentleman , like the former , that was doing what every body pleased to have him , and , taking all in good part , went on his way to the fire ; and however some , to gratify their fancy , might debase his character , yet certainly he was a person of high quality , because he came in the place of state , which is last of all . When these were passed , our coast began to clear , but it thickened upwards , and the noise increased ; for , as we were afterwards informed , these stately figures were planted in a demilune about an huge fire , that shined upon them ; and the balconies of the club were ready to crack with their factious load , till the good people were satiated with the fine show ; and then the hieroglyphic monsters were brought condignly to a new light of their own making , being , one after another , added to increase the flames : all which was performed with fitting salvos of the rabble , echoed from the club , which made a proper music to so pompous a sacrifice . Were it not for the late attempts to have renewed these barbarities ,<span corresp="#note369" type="note_anchor">[ 369 ]</span>it had been more reasonable to have forgot the past , that such a stain might not have remained upon the credit of human kind , whom we would not have thought obnoxious to any such ; but , as it is now otherwise , all persons , that mean humanely , ought to discourage them ; and one way is , to expose the factious brutality of such unthinking rabble sports , by showing , as near as we can , how really they were acted ; the very knowledge of which , one would think , should make them for ever to be abhorred and detested of all rational beings . ” — NORTH 'S Examen .</p>

    <note xml:id="note378" place="bottom" n="378">This and the following lines refer to the success of Shadwell 's comedy of “ The Lancashire Witches , ” in which a great deal of machinery is introduced ; the witches flying away with the clown 's candles , and the priest 's bottle of holy water , and converting a country-fellow into a horse upon the stage . Not content with this , the author has introduced upon the stage all that writers upon Dæmonology have rehearsed of the Witches ’ Sabbath , or Festival , with their infernal master ; and has thus , very clumsily , mixed the horrible with the ludicrous . As for the cats and dogs , we have , in one place ,— “ Enter an Imp , in the shape of a black Shock ; ” and , in another ,</note>

   <p>Besides the offence which Shadwell gave , in point of taste , by the introduction of these pantomimical absurdities , Dryden was also displeased by the whole tenor of the play , which was directed against the High-Churchmen and Tories .— See Dedication of the Duke of Guise , Vol .

    <head>The play , to which this is the prologue , is but a second-rate performance . It is founded on the story of Faustina and Crispus , which the learned will find in Ammianus Marcellinus , and the English reader in Gibbon . Arius , the heretic , is the villain of the piece , which concludes fortunately .</head>
     <l n="1">Our hero 's happy in the play 's conclusion ;</l>
     <l n="2">The holy rogue at last has met confusion :</l>
     <l n="3">Though Arius all along appeared a saint ,</l>

     <l n="11">Whigs kept the places they possest before ,</l>

     <l n="13">Which was as much as saying , Gentlemen ,</l>
     <l n="14">Here 's power and money to be rogues again .</l>
     <l n="15">Indeed , there were a sort of peaking tools ,</l>
     <l n="16">Some call them modest , but I call them fools ;</l>
     <l n="17">Men much more loyal , though not half so loud ,</l>
     <l n="18">But these poor devils were cast behind the crowd ;</l>
     <l n="19">For bold knaves thrive without one grain of sense ,</l>
     <l n="20">But good men starve for want of impudence .</l>
     <l n="21">Besides all these , there were a sort of wights ,</l>
     <l n="22">( I think my author calls them Tekelites ,)</l>
     <l n="23">Such hearty rogues against the king and laws ,</l>
     <l n="24">They favoured e'en a foreign rebel 's cause ,</l>

     <l n="29">Thus , o'er their darling plot these Trimmers cry , }</l>
     <l n="30">And , though they cannot keep it in their eye , }</l>
     <l n="31">They bind it ‘ prentice to Count Tekely .<span corresp="#note384" type="note_anchor">[ 384 ]</span>}</l>

     <l n="34">No wonder their own plot no plot they think ,—</l>
     <l n="35">The man , that makes it , never smells the stink .</l>
     <l n="36">And , now it comes into my head , I 'll tell</l>
     <l n="37">Why these damned Trimmers loved the Turks so well .</l>
     <l n="38">The original Trimmer ,<span corresp="#note385" type="note_anchor">[ 385 ]</span>though a friend to no man ,</l>
     <l n="39">Yet in his heart adored a pretty woman ;</l>
     <l n="40">He knew that Mahomet laid up for ever</l>
     <l n="41">Kind black-eyed rogues for every true believer ;</l>
     <l n="42">And ,— which was more than mortal man e'er tasted ,—</l>
     <l n="43">One pleasure that for threescore twelvemonths lasted .</l>

   <note xml:id="note384" place="bottom" n="384">The severity of the Austrian government , in Hungary particularly , towards those who dissented from the Roman Catholic faith , occasioned several insurrections . The most memorable was headed by Count Teckeli , who allied himself with the sultan , assumed the crown of Transylvania , as a vassal of the Porte , and joined , with a considerable force , the large army of Turks which besieged Vienna , and threatened to annihilate the Austrian empire . A similarity of situation and of interest induced the Whig party in England to look with a favourable eye upon this Hungarian insurgent , as may be fully inferred from the following passage in De Foe 's “ Appeal to Honour and Justice : ”</note>
   <p>“ The first time I had the misfortune to differ with my friends , was about the year 1683 , when the Turks were besieging Vienna , and the Whigs in England , generally speaking , were for the Turks taking it ; which I , having read the history of the cruelty and perfidious dealings of the Turks in their wars , and how they had rooted out the name of the Christian religion in above threescore and ten kingdoms , could by no means agree with ; and , though then but a young man , and a younger author , I opposed it , and wrote against it , which was taken very unkindly indeed . ”</p>
   <p>The incongruity of the opinion combated by De Foe , with the high pretences of religion set up by the Whigs , was the constant subject of ridicule to the Tory wits . In a poem , entitled , “ The Third Part of Advice to the Painter , ” dated by Luttrell 28th May , 1684 , we find the following passage :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Paint me that mighty powerful state a shaking ,</l>
     <l n="2">And their great prophet , Teckely , a quaking ;</l>

     <l n="4">That , to reform it , he brought in the Turk .</l>

   <p>Another ballad , written shortly after the defeat of Monmouth , is entitled , “ A Song upon the Rendezvous on Hounsley-heath , with a Parallel of the Destruction of our English Turks in the West , and the Mahometans in Hungary . ” The expression occurs also in the Address of the Carlisle Citizens on the Declaration of Indulgence , who “ thank his majesty for his royal army , which is really both the honour and safety of the nation , let the Teckelites think and say what they will . ” An indignant Whig commentator on this effusion of loyalty , says , “ What the good men of Carlisle mean by Teckelites , we know not any more than they know themselves . However , the word has a pretty effect at a time when the Protestant Hungarians , under Count Teckely , were well beaten by the Popish standing army in Hungary . ” History of Addresses , p . 161 . ]</p>
   <note xml:id="note385" place="bottom" n="385">The original Trimmer was probably meant for Lord Shaftesbury , once a member of the Cabal , and a favourite minister , though afterwards in such violent opposition . His lordship 's turn for gallantry was such as distinguished him even at the court of Charles .— See Vol . IX . p. 446 . The party of Trimmers , properly so called , only comprehended the followers of Halifax ; but our author seems to include all those who , professing to be friends of monarchy , were enemies of the Duke of York , and who were as odious to the court as the fanatical republicans . Much wit , and more virulence , was unchained against them . Among others , I find in Mr Luttrell 's Collection , a poem , entitled , “ The Character of a Trimmer , ” beginning thus :</note>

     <l n="7">Like Ireland shocks , he seems two natures joined ;</l>

    <head>This play is founded on the novel of the Impertinent Curiosity , in Don Quixote . It possesses no extraordinary merit . The satire of the Prologue , though grossly broad , is very forcibly expressed ; and describes what we may readily allow to have been the career of many , who set up for persons of wit and honour about town .</head>

     <l n="4">All prologues treat you at your own expence .</l>
     <l n="5">Sharp citizens a wiser way can go ;</l>
     <l n="6">They make you fools , but never call you so .</l>

     <l n="9">But here each saucy wit at random writes ,</l>
     <l n="10">And uses ladies as he uses knights .</l>
     <l n="11">Our author , young and grateful in his nature ,</l>
     <l n="12">Vows , that from him no nymph deserves a satire :</l>
     <l n="13">Nor will he ever draw — I mean his rhime ,</l>
     <l n="14">Against the sweet partaker of his crime ;</l>
     <l n="15">Nor is he yet so bold an undertaker ,</l>
     <l n="16">To call men fools — ‘ tis railing at their Maker .</l>
     <l n="17">Besides , he fears to split upon that shelf ;</l>
     <l n="18">He 's young enough to be a fop himself :</l>
     <l n="19">And , if his praise can bring you all a-bed ,</l>

   <p>TO</p>
   <p>THE KING AND QUEEN ,</p>
   <p>UPON THE</p>
   <p>UNION OF THE TWO COMPANIES , IN 1686 .</p>
   <p>The two rival Companies , so long known by the names of the King 's and the Duke 's players , after exhausting every effort , both of poetry and machinery , to obtain a superiority over each other , were , at length , by the expence of these exertions , and the inconstancy of the public , reduced to the necessity of uniting their forces , in order to maintain their ground . “ Taste and fashion , ” says Colley Cibber , “ with us , have always had wings , and fly from one public spectacle to another so wantonly , that I have been informed , by those who remember it , that a famous puppet-show , in Salisbury-change , then standing where Cecil-street now is , so far distressed these two celebrated companies , that they were reduced to petition the king for relief against it . Nor ought we , perhaps , to think this strange , when , if I mistake not , Terence himself reproaches the Roman auditors of his time with the like fondness for the funambuli , the rope-dancers . Not to dwell too long , therefore , upon that part of my history , which I have only collected from oral tradition , I shall content myself with telling you , that Mohun and Hart now growing old , ( for above thirty years before this time , they had severally borne the king 's commission of major and captain in the civil wars ,) and the younger actors , as Goodman , Clark , and others , being impatient to get into their parts , and growing intractable , the audiences too of both houses then falling off , the patentees of each , by the king 's advice , ( which , perhaps , amounted to a command ,) united their interests , and both companies into one , exclusive of all others , in the year 1684 . This union was , however , so much in favour of the Duke 's company , that Hart left the stage upon it , and Mohun survived not long after . "[ 388 ] Apology , p. 58 .</p>
   <p>It appears , that the king and queen honoured with their presence the first performance under the union they had recommended . Dryden 's prologue abounds with those violent expressions of loyalty with which James loved to be greeted .</p>

   <note xml:id="note393" place="bottom" n="393">Our author , who writes in all the exultation of triumphant Toryism , does not forget to bestow a passing sarcasm upon his political and personal enemy , Shadwell . In the observations on “ Mac-Flecnoe , ” and elsewhere , we have noticed Shadwell 's affectation of treading in the paths of Ben Jonson , by describing what he calls humours ; a word as great a favourite with the fat bard as with Corporal Nym . The following passage in the dedication of “ The Virtuoso , ” may serve to explain what he means by the phrase :</note>
   <p>“ I have endeavoured in this play , at humour , wit , and satire , which are the three things ( however I may have fallen short in my attempt ) which your grace has often told me are the life of a comedy . Four of the humours are entirely new ; and , without vanity , I may say I never produced a comedy that had not some natural humour in it , not represented before , nor , I hope , ever shall . Nor do I count those humours which a great many do ; that is to say , such as consist in using one or two by-words ; or in having a fantastic extravagant dress , as many pretended humours have ; nor in the affectation of some French words , which several plays have shown us . I say nothing of impossible , unnatural , farce fools , which some intend for comical ; who think it the easiest thing in the world to write a comedy , and yet will sooner grow rich upon their ill plays than write a good one : Nor is downright silly folly a humour , as some take it to be , for it is a mere natural imperfection ; and they might as well call it a humour of blindness in a blind man , or lameness in a lame one ; or as a celebrated French farce has the humour of one who speaks very fast , and of another who speaks very slow : But natural imperfections are not fit subjects for comedy , since they are not to be laughed at , but pitied . But the artificial folly of those who are not coxcombs by nature , but , with great art and industry , make themselves so , is a proper object of comedy ; as I have discoursed at large in the Preface to “ The Humourists , ” written five years since . Those slight circumstantial things , mentioned before , are not enough to make a good comical humour ; which ought to be such an affectation as misguides men in knowledge , art , or science ; or that causes defection in manners and morality , or perverts their minds in the main actions of their lives : And this kind of humour , I think , I have not improperly described in the Epilogue to “ The Humourists . ”</p>
   <p>“ But your grace understands humour too well not to know this , and much more than I can say of it . All I have now to do , is , humbly to dedicate this play to your grace , which has succeeded beyond my expectation ; and the humours of which have been approved by men of the best sense and learning . Nor do I hear of any professed enemies to the play , but some women , and some men of feminine understandings , who like slight plays only that represent a little tattle-sort of conversation like their own : but true humour is not liked or understood by them ; and therefore even my attempt towards it is condemned by them : but the same people , to my great comfort , damn all Mr Jonson 's plays , who was incomparably the best dramatic poet that ever was , or , I believe , ever will be ; and I had rather be author of one scene in his best comedies , than of any play this age has produced . ” ]</p>

    <head>BY MR N. LEE , 1689 .</head>
    <head>This play is one of the coarsest which ever appeared upon the stage . The author himself seems to be ashamed of it , and gives , for the profligacy of his hero , the Duke of Nemours , the odd reason of a former play on the subject of the Paris massacre having been prohibited , at the request , I believe , of the French ambassador . See Vol . VII . p. 188 .</head>

    <p>PROLOGUE</p>
    <p>TO</p>
    <p>ARVIRAGUS AND PHILICIA .</p>
    <p>BY LODOWICK CARLELL , ESQ .</p>
    <p>SPOKEN BY MR HART .</p>
    <p>Lodowick Carlell , according to Langbaine , was an ancient courtier , being gentleman of the bows to King Charles I ., groom of the king and queen 's privy chamber , and servant to the queen-mother many years . His plays , the same author adds , were well esteemed of , and acted chiefly at the private house in Blackfriars . They were seven in number . “ Arviragus and Philicia ” consisted of two parts , and was first printed in 8vo , 1639 . The prologue , which was spoken upon the revival of the piece , turns upon the caprice of the town , in preferring , to the plays of their own poets , the performances of a troop of French comedians , who , it seems , were then acting both tragedies and comedies in their own language .</p>
     <l n="1">With sickly actors , and an old house too ,</l>
     <l n="2">We 're matched with glorious theatres , and new ;</l>
     <l n="3">And with our alehouse scenes , and clothes bare worn ,</l>
     <l n="4">Can neither raise old plays , nor new adorn .</l>
     <l n="5">If all these ills could not undo us quite ,</l>
     <l n="6">A brisk French troop is grown your dear delight ;</l>
     <l n="7">Who with broad bloody bills call you each day ,</l>
     <l n="8">To laugh and break your buttons at their play ;</l>
     <l n="9">Or see some serious piece , which , we presume ,</l>
     <l n="10">Is fallen from some incomparable plume ;</l>
     <l n="11">“ And therefore , Messieurs , if you 'll do us grace ,</l>
     <l n="12">Send lacquies early to preserve your place . ”</l>
     <l n="13">We dare not on your privilege intrench ,</l>
     <l n="14">Or ask you , why you like them ?— they are French .</l>
     <l n="15">Therefore , some go with courtesy exceeding ,</l>
     <l n="16">Neither to hear nor see , but show their breeding ;</l>
     <l n="17">Each lady striving to outlaugh the rest ,</l>
     <l n="18">To make it seem they understood the jest .</l>
     <l n="19">Their countrymen come in , and nothing pay ,</l>
     <l n="20">To teach us English were to clap the play :</l>
     <l n="21">Civil , egad ! our hospitable land</l>

     <l n="25">And wish for your own sakes , without a satire ,</l>

    <head>THE PROPHETESS .</head>
    <head>BY</head>
    <head>BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER .</head>
    <head>REVIVED</head>
     <l n="1">By DRYDEN .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>SPOKEN BY MR BETTERTON .</p>
   <p>“ The Prophetess ” of Beaumont and Fletcher , even in its original state , required a good deal of machinery ; for it contains stage directions for thunder-bolts brandished from on high , and for a chariot drawn through mid air by flying dragons ; but it was now altered into an opera , with the addition of songs and scenical decorations , by Betterton , in 1690 . Our author wrote the following prologue , to introduce it upon the stage in its altered state . The music was by Henry Purcell , and is said to have merited applause . Rich , whose attachment to scenery and decoration is ridiculed by Pope , revived this piece , and piqued himself particularly upon a set of dancing chairs , which he devised for the nonce .</p>
   <p>The prologue gave offence to the court , and was prohibited by the Earl of Dorset , Lord Chamberlain , after the first day 's representation . It contains , Cibber remarks , some familiar metaphorical sneers at the Revolution itself ; and as the poetry is good , the offence was less pardonable . King William was at this time prosecuting his campaigns in Ireland ; and the author not only ridicules the warfare in which he was engaged , and the English volunteers who attended him , but even the government of Queen Mary in his absence .</p>

     <l n="1">What Nostradame , with all his art , can guess</l>
     <l n="2">The fate of our approaching Prophetess ?</l>
     <l n="3">A play , which , like a perspective set right ,</l>
     <l n="4">Presents our vast expences close to sight ;</l>
     <l n="5">But turn the tube , and there we sadly view</l>
     <l n="6">Our distant gains , and those uncertain too ;</l>
     <l n="7">A sweeping tax , which on ourselves we raise ,</l>
     <l n="8">And all , like you , in hopes of better days .</l>
     <l n="9">When will our losses warn us to be wise ?</l>
     <l n="10">Our wealth decreases , and our charges rise .</l>
     <l n="11">Money , the sweet allurer of our hopes ,</l>
     <l n="12">Ebbs out in oceans , and comes in by drops .</l>
     <l n="13">We raise new objects to provoke delight ,</l>
     <l n="14">But you grow sated ere the second sight .</l>
     <l n="15">False men , even so you serve your mistresses ;</l>
     <l n="16">They rise three stories in their towering dress ;</l>
     <l n="17">And , after all , you love not long enough</l>
     <l n="18">To pay the rigging , ere you leave them off .</l>
     <l n="19">Never content with what you had before ,</l>
     <l n="20">But true to change , and Englishmen all o'er .</l>
     <l n="21">Now honour calls you hence ; and all your care</l>
     <l n="22">Is to provide the horrid pomp of war .</l>
     <l n="23">In plume and scarf , jack-boots , and Bilbo blade ,</l>
     <l n="24">Your silver goes , that should support our trade .</l>
     <l n="25">Go , unkind heroes ! leave our stage to mourn ,</l>
     <l n="26">Till rich from vanquished rebels you return ;</l>
     <l n="27">And the fat spoils of Teague in triumph draw ,</l>
     <l n="28">His firkin butter , and his usquebaugh .</l>
     <l n="29">Go , conquerors of your male and female foes ;</l>
     <l n="30">Men without hearts , and women without hose .</l>

     <l n="32">Such proper pages will long trains become ;</l>
     <l n="33">With copper collars , and with brawny backs ,</l>
     <l n="34">Quite to put down the fashion of our blacks .<span corresp="#note400" type="note_anchor">[ 400 ]</span></l>
     <l n="35">Then shall the pious Muses pay their vows ,</l>

     <l n="38">We want not poets fit to sing your flights .</l>
     <l n="39">But you , bright beauties , for whose only sake</l>

     <l n="41">When they with happy gales are gone away , }</l>
     <l n="42">With your propitious presence grace our play , }</l>
     <l n="43">And with a sigh their empty seats survey ; }</l>
     <l n="44">Then think ,— On that bare bench my servant sat !</l>
     <l n="45">I see him ogle still , and hear him chat ;</l>
     <l n="46">Selling facetious bargains , and propounding</l>
     <l n="47">That witty recreation , called dum-founding .<span corresp="#note401" type="note_anchor">[ 401 ]</span>—</l>
     <l n="48">Their loss with patience we will try to bear ,</l>
     <l n="49">And would do more , to see you often here ;</l>
     <l n="50">That our dead stage , revived by your fair eyes ,</l>

   <p>Gentlemen , we must beg your pardon ; here 's no prologue to be had to-day . Our new play is like to come on , without a frontispiece ; as bald as one of you young beaux without your periwig . I left our young poet , snivelling and sobbing behind the scenes , and cursing somebody that has deceived him .</p>

    <head>HENRY II .</head>
    <head>BY JOHN BANCROFT ,</head>
    <head>AND PUBLISHED BY MR MOUNTFORT , 1693 .</head>
    <head>SPOKEN BY MRS BRACEGIRDLE .</head>
    <head>This play is founded on the amours of Henry II . and the death of fair Rosamond . John Bancroft , the author , was a surgeon , and wrote another play called “ Sertorius . ” He gave both the reputation and the profits of “ Henry II . ” to Mountfort , the comedian ; and probably made him no great compliment in the former particular , though , as the piece was well received , the latter might be of some consequence . Mountfort was an actor of great eminence . Cibber says , that he was the most affecting lover within his memory .</head>
     <l n="1">Thus you the sad catastrophe have seen ,</l>
     <l n="2">Occasioned by a mistress and a queen .</l>
     <l n="3">Queen Eleanor the proud was French , they say ;</l>
     <l n="4">But English manufacture got the day .</l>
     <l n="5">Jane Clifford was her name , as books aver ;</l>
     <l n="6">Fair Rosamond was but her nom de guerre .</l>
     <l n="7">Now tell me , gallants , would you lead your life</l>
     <l n="8">With such a mistress , or with such a wife ?</l>
     <l n="9">If one must be your choice , which d'ye approve ,</l>
     <l n="10">The curtain lecture , or the curtain love ?</l>
     <l n="11">Would ye be godly with perpetual strife ,</l>
     <l n="12">Still drudging on with homely Joan , your wife</l>
     <l n="13">Or take your pleasure in a wicked way ,</l>
     <l n="14">Like honest whoring Harry in the play ?</l>
     <l n="15">I guess your minds ; the mistress would be taken ,</l>
     <l n="16">And nauseous matrimony sent a packing .</l>
     <l n="17">The devil 's in you all ; mankind 's a rogue ;</l>
     <l n="18">You love the bride , but you detest the clog .</l>
     <l n="19">After a year , poor spouse is left i'the lurch ,</l>
     <l n="20">And you , like Haynes ,<span corresp="#note405" type="note_anchor">[ 405 ]</span>return to mother-church .</l>

     <l n="28">Mangos and limes , whose nourishment is little ,</l>
     <l n="29">Though not for food , are yet preserved for pickle .</l>
     <l n="30">So this green writer may pretend , at least ,</l>

     <l n="32">He makes this difference in the sexes too ;</l>
     <l n="33">He sells to men , he gives himself to you .</l>
     <l n="34">To both he would contribute some delight ;</l>
     <l n="35">A meer poetical hermaphrodite .</l>

   <p>PROLOGUE</p>
   <p>TO</p>
   <p>ALBUMAZAR .</p>
   <p>The old Play , to which this prologue was prefixed upon its revival , was originally acted in 1634 , three or four years after the appearance of Jonson 's “ Alchemist ; ” to which , therefore , it could not possibly afford any hint . Dryden , observing the resemblance between the plays , took the plagiarism for granted , because the style of “ Albumazar ” is certainly the most antiquated . This appearance of antiquity is , however , only a consequence of the vein of pedantry which runs through the whole piece . It was written by —— Tomkins , a scholar of Trinity College , and acted before King James VI . by the gentlemen of that house , 9th March , 1614 . It is , upon the whole , a very excellent play ; yet the author , whether consulting his own taste , or that of our British Solomon , before whom it was to be represented , has contrived to give it an air of such learned stiffness , that it much more resembles the translation of a play from Terence or Plautus , than an original English composition . By this pedantic affectation , the humour of the play is completely smothered ; and although there are several very excellent comic situations in the action , yet neither the attempt to revive it in Dryden 's time , nor those which followed in 1748 and 1773 , met with any success .</p>
   <p>As Dryden had imputed , very rashly , however , and groundlessly , the guilt of plagiarism to Jonson , he made this supposed crime the introduction to a similar slur on Shadwell , who at that time seems to have been possessed of the laurel ; a circumstance which ascertains the date of the prologue to be posterior to the Revolution .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">To say this comedy pleased long ago ,</l>
     <l n="2">Is not enough to make it pass you now .</l>
     <l n="3">Yet , gentlemen , your ancestors had wit ,</l>
     <l n="4">When few men censured , and when fewer writ .</l>
     <l n="5">And Jonson , of those few the best , chose this ,</l>
     <l n="6">As the best model of his master-piece :</l>
     <l n="7">Subtle was got by our Albumazar ,</l>
     <l n="8">That Alchymist by this Astrologer ;</l>
     <l n="9">Here he was fashioned , and we may suppose ,</l>
     <l n="10">He liked the fashion well , who wore the clothes .</l>
     <l n="11">But Ben made nobly his what he did mould ;</l>
     <l n="12">What was another 's lead , becomes his gold :</l>
     <l n="13">Like an unrighteous conqueror he reigns ,</l>
     <l n="14">Yet rules that well , which he unjustly gains .</l>
     <l n="15">But this our age such authors does afford ,</l>
     <l n="16">As make whole plays , and yet scarce write one word ;</l>
     <l n="17">Who , in this anarchy of wit , rob all ,</l>
     <l n="18">And what 's their plunder , their possession call ;</l>
     <l n="19">Who , like bold padders , scorn by night to prey ,</l>
     <l n="20">But rob by sun-shine , in the face of day :</l>
     <l n="21">Nay , scarce the common ceremony use</l>
     <l n="22">Of , “ Stand , Sir , and deliver up your Muse ; ”</l>
     <l n="23">But knock the poet down , and , with a grace ,</l>
     <l n="24">Mount Pegasus before the owner 's face .</l>
     <l n="25">Faith , if you have such country Toms abroad ,<span corresp="#note406" type="note_anchor">[ 406 ]</span></l>
     <l n="26">‘ Tis time for all true men to leave that road .</l>
     <l n="27">Yet it were modest , could it but be said ,</l>
     <l n="28">They strip the living , but these rob the dead ;</l>
     <l n="29">Dare with the mummies of the Muses play ,</l>
     <l n="30">And make love to them the Egyptian way ;</l>
     <l n="31">Or , as a rhiming author would have said ,</l>
     <l n="32">Join the dead living to the living dead .</l>
     <l n="33">Such men in poetry may claim some part ,</l>
     <l n="34">They have the license , though they want the art ;</l>
     <l n="35">And might , where theft was praised , for laureats stand ;<span corresp="#note407" type="note_anchor">[ 407 ]</span></l>
     <l n="36">Poets , not of the head , but of the hand .</l>
     <l n="37">They make the benefits of others studying ,</l>
     <l n="38">Much like the meals of politic Jack-Pudding ,</l>
     <l n="39">Whose dish to challenge no man has the courage ;</l>
     <l n="40">‘ Tis all his own , when once he has spit i'the porridge .</l>
     <l n="41">But , gentlemen , you 're all concerned in this ;</l>
     <l n="42">You are in fault for what they do amiss ;</l>
     <l n="43">For they their thefts still undiscovered think ,</l>
     <l n="44">And durst not steal , unless you please to wink .</l>
     <l n="45">Perhaps , you may award by your decree ,</l>
     <l n="46">They should refund ,— but that can never be ;</l>
     <l n="47">For , should you letters of reprisal seal ,</l>
     <l n="48">These men write that which no man else would steal .</l>

I am not able to discover , if Shadwell had given any very recent cause for this charge of plagiarism . In the “ Libertine , ” “ The Miser , ” “ Bury-fair , ” and “ The Sullen Lovers , ” he has borrowed , or rather translated , from Moliere . The “ Squire of Alsatia ” contains some imitations of Terence 's “ Adelphi . ” “ Psyche ” is taken from the French , and “ Timon of Athens ” from Shakespeare , although Shadwell has the assurance to claim the merit of having made it into a play . He was also under obligations to his contemporaries . The “ Royal Shepherdess ” was originally written by one Mr Fountain of Devonshire . Dryden , in “ Mac-Flecnoe , ” intimates , that Sedley “ larded with wit ” his play of “ Epsom Wells ; ” and in the Dedication to the “ True Widow , ” Shadwell himself acknowledges obligations to that gentleman 's revision of some of his pieces . Langbaine , who hated Dryden , and professed an esteem for Shadwell , expresses himself thus , on the latter 's claim to originality :</note>
   <p>“ But I am willing to say the less of Mr Shadwell , because I have publicly professed a friendship for him ; and though it be not of so long date as some former intimacy with others , so neither is it blemished with some unhandsome dealings I have met with from persons where I least expected it . I shall therefore speak of him with the impartiality that becomes a critic , and own I like his comedies better than Mr Dryden 's , as having more variety of characters , and those drawn from the life ; I mean men 's converse and manners , and not from other men 's ideas , copied out of their public writings : though indeed I cannot wholly acquit our present laureat from borrowing ; his plagiaries being in some places too bold and open to be disguised , of which I shall take notice , as I go along ; though with this remark , that several of them are observed to my hand , and in great measure excused by himself , in the public acknowledgment he makes in his several prefaces , to the persons to whom he was obliged for what he borrowed . ”</p>
   <p>Shadwell in the following lines , which occur in the prologue to the “ Scowerers , ” seems to retort on Dryden the accusation here brought against him :</p>

     <l n="1">You have been kind to many of his plays ,</l>

   <note xml:id="note408" place="bottom" n="408">Perhaps our author had in view the three oppositions of Saturn and Jupiter in June and December 1692 , and in April 1693 , which are thus feelingly descanted upon by John Silvester : “ It hath been long observed , that the most remarkable mutations of a kingdom , or nation , have chiefly depended on the conjunctions or aspects of those two superior planets , Saturn and Jupiter ; and by their effects past , we perceive that the most wise Creator first placed them higher than all the other planets , that they should respect , chiefly , the highest and most durable affairs and concerns of men on earth .</note>
   <p>“ And if one opposition of Saturn and Jupiter produceth much , how then can those three oppositions to come do any less than cause some remarkable changes and alterations of laws , or religious orders , in England 's chief and most renowned city ? because Saturn then will be stronger than Jupiter , who also , at his second opposition , will be near unto the body of Mars , ( the planet of war ;) and having took possession of religious Jupiter , should contend with him , ( with a frowning lofty countenance ,) in London 's ascendant , from whence I fear some religious disturbances , if not some warlike violence , by insurrections , or otherwise , occasioned by some frowning dissatisfied minds , which will then happen in some part of Britain , or take its beginning there to the purpose in those years .</p>
   <p>“ Ah poor Jupiter in Gemini ! ( London ,) I fear thou wilt then be so much humbled against thy will , that thou wilt think thou hast a sufficient occasion to bewail thy condition ; and if so , God will suffer this , that thou mayest humbly endeavour to forsake thy accustomed sins , and that thou mayest know power is not in thee to help thyself . But yet I think thou wilt then have no need to fear that God hath wholly forsaken thee ; for look but a little back unto the years 1682 and 1683 , where Jupiter was three times in conjunction with Saturn , in a sign of his own triplicity , and consider , was not he then stronger than Saturn , and hast not thou been victorious ever since , throughout all those great changes and alterations ? And when thou hast thus considered , perhaps thou wilt believe , that that which begins well will end well ; and indeed perhaps it may so happen ; but be not too proud of this , a word is enough to the wise . ” — Astrological Observations and Predictions for the year of our Lord 1691 , by John Silvester .

   <p>MAC-FLECNOE ,</p>
   <p>A SATIRE</p>
   <p>AGAINST</p>
   <p>THOMAS SHADWELL .</p>
   <p>MAC-FLECNOE .</p>
   <p>The enmity between Dryden and Shadwell at first probably only sprung from some of those temporary causes of disgust , which must frequently divide persons whose lives are spent in a competition for public applause . That they were occasionally upon tolerable terms is certain , for Dryden has told us so ; and Shadwell , in 1676 , when expressing his dissent from one of our author 's rules of theatrical criticism , industriously and anxiously qualifies his opinion , with the highest compliments to our author 's genius .<span corresp="#note411" type="note_anchor">[ 411 ]</span>They had formerly even joined forces , and called in the aid of another wit , to overwhelm the reputation of no less a person than Elkanah Settle .<span corresp="#note412" type="note_anchor">[ 412 ]</span>But , between the politics of the stage and of the nation , the friendship of these bards , which probably never had a very solid foundation , was at length totally overthrown . It is not very easy to discover who struck the first blow ; but it may be suspected , that Dryden was displeased to see Shadwell not only dispute his canons of criticism in print , but seem to establish himself as an imitator of the old school of dramatic composition , and particularly of Jonson , on whom Dryden had thrown some censure in his epilogue to “ The Conquest of Grenada , ” and in the Defence of these verses . It seems certain , that the feud had broke out in 1675-6 ; for Shadwell has not only made some invidious allusions to the success of “ Aureng-Zebe , ” which was represented that season , but has plainly intimated , that he needed only a pension to enable him to write as well as Dryden himself .<span corresp="#note413" type="note_anchor">[ 413 ]</span>This assault , however , seems to have been forgiven ; for Dryden obliged Shadwell with an epilogue to the “ True Widow , ” acted in 1678 . But their precarious reconcilement did not long subsist , when political animosity was added to literary rivalry . Shadwell not only wrote the “ Lancashire Witches , ” in ridicule of the Tory party , but entered into a personal contest with our author on the subject of “ The Medal , ” which he answered by a clumsy , though venomous , retort , called “ The Medal of John Bayes . ” In the preface he asserts , that no one can think Dryden “ hardly dealt with , since he knows , and so do all his old acquaintance , that there is not one untrue word spoke of him . ” Neither was this a single offence ; for Dryden , in his “ Vindication of the Duke of Guise , ” says , that Shadwell has repeatedly called him Atheist in print . These reiterated insults at length drew down the vengeance of our poet , who seems to have singled Shadwell from the herd of those who had libelled him , to be gibbetted in rhyme while the English language shall last . Neither was Dryden satisfied with a single attack upon this obnoxious bard ; but , having divided his poetical character from that which he held as a political writer , he discussed the first in the satire which follows , and the last , with equal severity , in the Second Part of “ Absalom and Achitophel . ” These two admirable pieces of satire appeared within less than a month of each other ; and leave it a matter of doubt , whether the bitter ridicule of the anointed Prince of Dulness , or the sarcastic description of Og , the seditious poetaster , be most cruelly severe .</p>
   <p>“ Mac-Flecnoe ” must be allowed to be one of the keenest satires in the English language . It is what Dryden has elsewhere termed a Varronian satire ;<span corresp="#note414" type="note_anchor">[ 414 ]</span>that is , as he seems to use the phrase , one in which the author is not contented with general sarcasm upon the object of attack , but where he has woven his piece into a sort of imaginary story , or scene , in which he introduces the person , whom he ridicules , as a principal actor . The position in which Dryden has placed Shadwell is the most mortifying to literary vanity which can possibly be imagined , and is hardly excelled by the device of Pope in the “ Dunciad , ” who has obviously followed the steps of his predecessor . Flecnoe , who seems to have been universally acknowledged as the very lowest of all poetasters , and whose name had passed into a proverb for doggrel verse and stupid prose , is represented as devolving upon Shadwell that pre-eminence over the realms of Dulness , which he had himself possessed without a rival . The spot chosen for this devolution of empire is the Barbican , an obscure suburb , in which it would seem that there were temporary theatrical representations of the lowest order , among other receptacles of vulgar dissipation , for the amusement of the very lowest of the vulgar . Here the ceremony of Shadwell 's coronation is supposed to be performed with an inaugural oration by Flecnoe , his predecessor , in which all his pretensions to wit and to literary fame are sarcastically enumerated and confuted , by a counter-statement of his claims to distinction by pre-eminent and unrivalled stupidity . In this satire , the shafts of the poet are directed with an aim acutely malignant . The inference drawn concerning Shadwell 's talents is general and absolute ; but in the proof , Dryden appeals with triumph to those parts only of his literary character which are obviously vulnerable . He reckons up among his titles to the throne of Flecnoe , his desperate and unsuccessful attempts at lyrical composition , in the opera of “ Psyche ; ” the clumsy and coarse limning of those whom he designed to figure as fine gentlemen in his comedies ; the false and florid taste of his dedications ; his presumptuous imitation of Jonson in composition , and his absurd resemblance to him in person . But the satirist industriously keeps out of view those points , in which perhaps he internally felt some inferiority to the object of his wrath . He mentions nothing that could recal to the reader 's recollection that insight into human life , that acquaintance with the foibles and absurdities displayed in individual pursuits , that bold though coarse delineation of character , which gave fame to Shadwell 's comedies in the last century , and renders them amusing even at the present day . This discrimination is an excellent proof of the exquisite address with which Dryden wielded the satirical weapon , and managed the feelings of his readers . We never find him attempting a desperate or impossible task ; at least in a way which seems , in the moment of perusal , desperate or impossible . He never wastes his powder against the impregnable part of a fortress , but directs all his battery against some weaker spot , where a breach may be rendered practicable . In short , by convincing his reader that he is right in the examples which he quotes , he puts the question at issue upon the ground most disadvantageous for his antagonist , and renders it very difficult for one who has been proved a dunce in one instance to establish his credit in any other .</p>
   <p>I have had so frequently to call the attention of my reader to the sonorous and emphatic effect of Dryden 's versification , that it is almost ridiculous to repeat epithets which apply to every poem which succeeded his Annus Mirabilis ; yet I cannot but remark , that the mock heroic may be said to have owed its rise to our author , and that there is hardly any poem , before “ Mac-Flecnoe , ” in which it has been employed with all its qualities of grave and pompous irony , expressed in solemn and sounding verse .</p>
   <p>It is no inconsiderable part of the merit of “ Mac-Flecnoe , ” that it led the way to the “ Dunciad : ” yet , while we acknowledge the more copious and variegated flow of Pope 's satire , we must not forget , that , independent of the merit of originality , always inestimable , Dryden 's poem claims that of a close and more compact fable , of a single and undisturbed aim . Pope 's ridicule and sarcasm is scattered so wide , and among such a number of authors , that it resembles small shot discharged at random among a crowd ; while that of Dryden , like a single well-directed bullet , prostrates the individual object against whom it was directed . Besides , the reader is apt to sympathise with the degree of the satirist 's provocation , which , in Dryden 's case , cannot be disputed ; whereas Pope sometimes confounds those , from whom he had received gross incivility , with others who had given him no offence , and with some whose characters were above his accusation . To posterity , the “ Mac-Flecnoe ” possesses a decided superiority over the “ Dunciad , ” for a very few facts make us master of the argument ; while that of the latter poem , excepting the Sixth Book , where the satire is more general , requires a note at every tenth line to render it even intelligible .</p>
   <p>Mr Malone has given us the title of the first edition of “ Mac-Flecnoe , ” which the present Editor has never seen , as indeed it is of the last degree of rarity . It was published not by Tonson , but by D. Green , and entitled , “ Mac-Flecnoe , or a Satire on the True-blue<span corresp="#note415" type="note_anchor">[ 415 ]</span>Protestant Poet , T. S .; by the Author of Absalom and Achitophel . ” It consisted only of one sheet and a half , and was sold for twopence . The satire was too personal , and too poignant , to fail in attracting immediate attention , and accordingly the poem was quickly sold off . It was not republished until it appeared in Tonson 's first Miscellany , in 1684 , with a few slight alterations , intended either to point particular verses , or to correct errors of the press , or pen . It must have been generally known , that Dryden was the author of this satire , both because it is stated in the title-page to be by the author of “ Absalom and Achitophel , ” and because there existed no contemporary poet to whom so masterly a production could have been ascribed , even with remote probability ; yet Shadwell , in his dedication of the tenth satire of Juvenal , ( a most miserable performance ,) says , that Dryden , when he taxed him with being the author , “ denied it with all the execrations he could think of ; ” an accusation which was echoed by Brown , though apparently upon the authority of Shadwell alone .<span corresp="#note416" type="note_anchor">[ 416 ]</span>From this averment , which is probably made far too broadly , we can only infer , that Dryden , like Swift in the same predicament , left his adversary to prove what he had no title to call upon him to confess ; for that he seriously meant to disavow a performance , of which he had from the very beginning sufficiently avouched himself the author , can hardly be supposed for a moment . It has indeed been noticed , that our author has omitted this poem , as well as the “ Eulogy on Cromwell , ” in a list of his plays and poems subjoined to one of his plays ; but Dryden might not think fit to admit a personal , and what he probably considered as a fugitive satire , into a formal list of his poetry . We know he entertained a conscious sense of his dignity in this respect ; for , excepting in a slight and passing sarcasm , he never deigned to answer any of his literary adversaries , excepting Settle and Shadwell ; and he might possibly think , on reflection , that he had done the latter too much honour in making him the subject of a separate and laboured poem . Mr Malone also conceives , that he might be with-held from inserting this poem in an authoritative list of his works , by delicacy towards Dorset , his recent benefactor , who had thought Shadwell worthy of the laurel of which our poet had been divested at the Revolution . Be it as it may , he was afterwards so far from disowning the poem , that , in the Essay on Satire , he gives it , with “ Absalom and Achitophel , ” as instances of his own attempts at the Varronian satire .</p>
   <p>The purpose and scope of “ Mac-Flecnoe ” was strangely misconstrued by the object of it , and by our poet 's editors . Shadwell took it into his head , that Dryden meant seriously to tax him with being an Irishman ; a charge which he seems more anxious to refute than seems necessary . Cibber , or whoever wrote Dryden 's Life in the collection bearing his name , supposes , that Flecnoe , who died in 1678 , had actually succeeded our author in the office of poet-laureat . Derrick , though he corrects this error , has fallen into another , in which he is followed by Dr Johnson , who considers “ Mac-Flecnoe ” as written in express ridicule of Shadwell 's inauguration as court poet . The scarcity of the first edition of “ Mac-Flecnoe ” might have been some excuse for these errors , had not the piece been printed in the first Miscellany , in 1684 , four years before Dryden 's being deposed , and Shadwell succeeding him . Certainly the two events tallied strangely ; and the friends of Shadwell might have considered the substantial office which he gained by the downfall of Dryden , as a just compensation for the ludicrous and mock dignity with which his foe had invested him .</p>

   <p>That these insinuations might not be mistaken , Shadwell , in the epilogue , severely attacks rhyming tragedies in general ; the object of which diatribe , considering the late success of “ Aureng-Zebe , ” could not possibly be misinterpreted :</p>

     <l n="7">Rant at the gods , and do impossible things ;</l>

   <p>The passage in the Dedication , in which he insinuates that the provision of a pension was all he wanted , to place him on a level with the proudest of his rivals , is as follows : “ That there are a great many faults in the conduct of this play , I am not ignorant ; but I ( having no pension but from the theatre , which is either unwilling , or unable , to reward a man sufficiently for so much pains as correct comedies require ) cannot allot my whole time to the writing of plays , but am forced to mind some other business of advantage . Had I as much money , and as much time for it , I might perhaps write as correct a comedy as any of my contemporaries . ” ]</p>

     <l n="1">All human things are subject to decay ,</l>
     <l n="2">And , when fate summons , monarchs must obey .</l>
     <l n="3">This Flecknoe found ,<span corresp="#note417" type="note_anchor">[ 417 ]</span>who , like Augustus , young</l>
     <l n="4">Was called to empire , and had governed long ;</l>
     <l n="5">In prose and verse was owned , without dispute ,</l>
     <l n="6">Through all the realms of Nonsense , absolute .</l>
     <l n="7">This aged prince , now flourishing in peace ,</l>
     <l n="8">And blest with issue of a large increase ,</l>
     <l n="9">Worn out with business , did at length debate</l>
     <l n="10">To settle the succession of the state ;</l>
     <l n="11">And , pondering which of all his sons was fit</l>
     <l n="12">To reign , and wage immortal war with wit ,</l>
     <l n="13">Cried ,— ‘ Tis resolved ! for nature pleads , that he</l>
     <l n="14">Should only rule , who most resembles me .</l>
     <l n="15">Shadwell alone my perfect image bears ,</l>
     <l n="16">Mature in dulness from his tender years ;<span corresp="#note418" type="note_anchor">[ 418 ]</span></l>
     <l n="17">Shadwell alone , of all my sons , is he ,</l>
     <l n="18">Who stands confirmed in full stupidity .</l>
     <l n="19">The rest to some faint meaning make pretence ,</l>
     <l n="20">But Shadwell never deviates into sense ;</l>
     <l n="21">Some beams of wit on other souls may fall ,</l>
     <l n="22">Strike through , and make a lucid interval ;</l>
     <l n="23">But Shadwell 's genuine night admits no ray ,</l>
     <l n="24">His rising fogs prevail upon the day .</l>
     <l n="25">Besides , his goodly fabric fills the eye ,</l>
     <l n="26">And seems designed for thoughtless majesty ;</l>
     <l n="27">Thoughtless as monarch oaks , that shade the plain ,</l>
     <l n="28">And , spread in solemn state , supinely reign .</l>
     <l n="29">Heywood and Shirley<span corresp="#note419" type="note_anchor">[ 419 ]</span>were but types of thee ,</l>
     <l n="30">Thou last great prophet of tautology !</l>
     <l n="31">Even I , a dunce of more renown than they ,</l>
     <l n="32">Was sent before but to prepare thy way ;</l>
     <l n="33">And , coarsely clad in Norwich drugget ,<span corresp="#note420" type="note_anchor">[ 420 ]</span>came</l>
     <l n="34">To teach the nations in thy greater name .</l>
     <l n="35">My warbling lute ,— the lute I whilom strung ,</l>
     <l n="36">When to king John of Portugal I sung ,—</l>
     <l n="37">Was but the prelude to that glorious day ,</l>
     <l n="38">When thou on silver Thames didst cut thy way ,</l>
     <l n="39">With well-timed oars , before the royal barge ,<span corresp="#note421" type="note_anchor">[ 421 ]</span></l>
     <l n="40">Swelled with the pride of thy celestial charge ;</l>
     <l n="41">And big with hymn , commander of an host ,—</l>
     <l n="42">The like was ne'er in Epsom blankets tost .<span corresp="#note422" type="note_anchor">[ 422 ]</span></l>
     <l n="43">Methinks I see the new Arion sail ,</l>
     <l n="44">The lute still trembling underneath thy nail .<span corresp="#note423" type="note_anchor">[ 423 ]</span></l>
     <l n="45">At thy well-sharpened thumb , from shore to shore ,</l>
     <l n="46">The trebles squeak for fear , the basses roar ;</l>
     <l n="47">Echoes , from Pissing-Alley , Shadwell call ,</l>
     <l n="48">And Shadwell they resound from Aston-Hall .</l>
     <l n="49">About thy boat the little fishes throng ,</l>
     <l n="50">As at the morning toast that floats along .</l>
     <l n="51">Sometimes , as prince of thy harmonious band ,</l>
     <l n="52">Thou weild'st thy papers in thy threshing hand ;</l>
     <l n="53">St André 's<span corresp="#note424" type="note_anchor">[ 424 ]</span>feet ne'er kept more equal time ,</l>
     <l n="54">Not even the feet of thy own Psyche 's rhyme ,</l>
     <l n="55">Though they in number as in sense excel ;<span corresp="#note425" type="note_anchor">[ 425 ]</span></l>
     <l n="56">So just , so like tautology , they fell ,</l>
     <l n="57">That , pale with envy , Singleton<span corresp="#note426" type="note_anchor">[ 426 ]</span>forswore }</l>
     <l n="58">The lute and sword , which he in triumph bore , }</l>
     <l n="59">And vowed he ne'er would act Villerius more .—}</l>
     <l n="60">Here stopt the good old sire , and wept for joy ,</l>
     <l n="61">In silent raptures of the hopeful boy .</l>
     <l n="62">All arguments , but most his plays , persuade ,</l>
     <l n="63">That for anointed dulness he was made .</l>
     <l n="64">Close to the walls which fair Augusta bind ,</l>
     <l n="65">( The fair Augusta much to fears inclined , [ 427 ])</l>
     <l n="66">An ancient fabric raised to inform the sight ,</l>
     <l n="67">There stood of yore , and Barbican it hight ;</l>
     <l n="68">A watch-tower once , but now , so fate ordains ,</l>
     <l n="69">Of all the pile an empty name remains ;</l>
     <l n="70">From its old ruins brothel-houses rise ,</l>
     <l n="71">Scenes of lewd loves , and of polluted joys ;</l>
     <l n="72">Where their vast courts the mother-strumpets keep ,</l>
     <l n="73">And , undisturbed by watch , in silence sleep .<span corresp="#note428" type="note_anchor">[ 428 ]</span></l>
     <l n="74">Near these a nursery erects its head ,</l>
     <l n="75">Where queens are formed , and future heroes bred ;</l>
     <l n="76">Where unfledged actors learn to laugh and cry ;}</l>
     <l n="77">Where infant punks their tender voices try , }</l>
     <l n="78">And little Maximins the gods defy . }</l>
     <l n="79">Great Fletcher never treads in buskins here ,</l>
     <l n="80">Nor greater Jonson dares in socks appear ;</l>
     <l n="81">But gentle Simkin<span corresp="#note429" type="note_anchor">[ 429 ]</span>just reception finds</l>
     <l n="82">Amidst this monument of vanished minds ;</l>
     <l n="83">Pure clinches the suburbian muse affords ,</l>
     <l n="84">And Panton<span corresp="#note430" type="note_anchor">[ 430 ]</span>waging harmless war with words .</l>
     <l n="85">Here Flecknoe , as a place to fame well known ,</l>
     <l n="86">Ambitiously designed his Shadwell 's throne .</l>
     <l n="87">For ancient Decker<span corresp="#note431" type="note_anchor">[ 431 ]</span>prophesied long since , }</l>
     <l n="88">That in this pile should reign a mighty prince ,}</l>
     <l n="89">Born for a scourge of wit , and flail of sense ; }</l>
     <l n="90">To whom true dulness should some Psyches owe ,</l>
     <l n="91">But worlds of Misers from his pen should flow ;</l>
     <l n="92">Humorists , and Hypocrites , it should produce ,</l>
     <l n="93">Whole Raymond families , and tribes of Bruce .<span corresp="#note432" type="note_anchor">[ 432 ]</span></l>
     <l n="94">Now empress Fame had published the renown</l>
     <l n="95">Of Shadwell 's coronation through the town .</l>
     <l n="96">Roused by report of fame , the nations meet ,</l>
     <l n="97">From near Bunhill , and distant Watling-street .</l>
     <l n="98">No Persian carpets spread the imperial way ,</l>
     <l n="99">But scattered limbs of mangled poets lay ;</l>
     <l n="100">From dusty shops neglected authors come ,</l>
     <l n="101">Martyrs of pies , and relics of the bum ;</l>
     <l n="102">Much Heywood , Shirley , Ogleby there lay ,</l>
     <l n="103">But loads of Shadwell almost choked the way ;</l>
     <l n="104">Bilked stationers for yeomen stood prepared ,</l>
     <l n="105">And Herringman<span corresp="#note433" type="note_anchor">[ 433 ]</span>was captain of the guard .</l>
     <l n="106">The hoary prince in majesty appeared ,</l>
     <l n="107">High on a throne of his own labours reared .</l>
     <l n="108">At his right hand our young Ascanius sate ,</l>
     <l n="109">Rome 's other hope , and pillar of the state ;</l>
     <l n="110">His brows thick fogs , instead of glories , grace ,</l>
     <l n="111">And lambent dulness played around his face .</l>
     <l n="112">As Hannibal did to the altars come ,</l>
     <l n="113">Swore by his sire , a mortal foe to Rome ,</l>
     <l n="114">So Shadwell swore , nor should his vow be vain ,</l>
     <l n="115">That he till death true dulness would maintain ;</l>
     <l n="116">And , in his father 's right , and realm 's defence ,</l>
     <l n="117">Ne'er to have peace with wit , nor truce with sense .</l>
     <l n="118">The king himself the sacred unction made ,</l>
     <l n="119">As king by office , and as priest by trade .</l>
     <l n="120">In his sinister hand , instead of ball ,</l>
     <l n="121">He placed a mighty mug of potent ale ;</l>
     <l n="122">“ Love 's kingdom "[ 434 ] to his right he did convey ,</l>
     <l n="123">At once his sceptre , and his rule of sway ;</l>
     <l n="124">Whose righteous lore the prince had practised young ,</l>
     <l n="125">And from whose loins recorded Psyche sprung .</l>
     <l n="126">His temples , last , with poppies were o'erspread ,<span corresp="#note435" type="note_anchor">[ 435 ]</span></l>
     <l n="127">That nodding seemed to consecrate his head .</l>
     <l n="128">Just at the point of time , if fame not lie ,</l>
     <l n="129">On his left hand twelve reverend owls did fly ;—</l>
     <l n="130">So Romulus , ‘ tis sung , by Tyber 's brook ,</l>
     <l n="131">Presage of sway from twice six vultures took .</l>
     <l n="132">The admiring throng loud acclamations make ,</l>
     <l n="133">And omens of his future empire take .</l>
     <l n="134">The sire then shook the honours of his head ,</l>
     <l n="135">And from his brows damps of oblivion shed</l>
     <l n="136">Full on the filial dulness : long he stood , }</l>
     <l n="137">Repelling from his breast the raging god ; }</l>
     <l n="138">At length burst out in this prophetic mood :—}</l>
     <l n="139">Heavens bless my son ! from Ireland let him reign ,</l>
     <l n="140">To far Barbadoes on the western main ;</l>
     <l n="141">Of his dominion may no end be known ,</l>
     <l n="142">And greater than his father 's be his throne ;</l>
     <l n="143">Beyond love 's kingdom let him stretch his pen !—</l>
     <l n="144">He paused , and all the people cried , Amen .—</l>
     <l n="145">Then thus continued he : My son , advance</l>
     <l n="146">Still in new impudence , new ignorance .</l>
     <l n="147">Success let others teach , learn thou from me</l>
     <l n="148">Pangs without birth , and fruitless industry .</l>
     <l n="149">Let Virtuosos in five years be writ ,</l>
     <l n="150">Yet not one thought accuse thy toil of wit .<span corresp="#note436" type="note_anchor">[ 436 ]</span></l>
     <l n="151">Let gentle George in triumph tread the stage ,</l>
     <l n="152">Make Dorimant betray , and Loveit rage ;</l>
     <l n="153">Let Cully , Cockwood , Fopling , charm the pit ,<span corresp="#note437" type="note_anchor">[ 437 ]</span></l>
     <l n="154">And in their folly show the writer 's wit ;</l>
     <l n="155">Yet still thy fools shall stand in thy defence ,</l>
     <l n="156">And justify their author 's want of sense .</l>
     <l n="157">Let them be all by thy own model made</l>
     <l n="158">Of dulness , and desire no foreign aid ;</l>
     <l n="159">That they to future ages may be known ,</l>
     <l n="160">Not copies drawn , but issue of thy own :</l>
     <l n="161">Nay , let thy men of wit too be the same ,</l>
     <l n="162">All full of thee , and differing but in name ;</l>

     <l n="167">But write thy best , and top ; and , in each line ,</l>

     <l n="173">Let father Flecknoe fire thy mind with praise ,</l>
     <l n="174">And uncle Ogleby thy envy raise .</l>
     <l n="175">Thou art my blood , where Jonson has no part :</l>
     <l n="176">What share have we in nature , or in art ?</l>
     <l n="177">Where did his wit on learning fix a brand ,</l>
     <l n="178">And rail at arts he did not understand ?</l>
     <l n="179">Where made he love in Prince Nicander 's vein ,</l>
     <l n="180">Or swept the dust in Psyche 's humble strain ?</l>
     <l n="181">Where sold he bargains , “ whip-stitch , kiss my arse ,"[ 441 ]</l>
     <l n="182">Promised a play , and dwindled to a farce ?</l>
     <l n="183">When did his muse from Fletcher scenes purloin ,</l>
     <l n="184">As thou whole Etheridge dost transfuse to thine ?</l>
     <l n="185">But so transfused , as oil and waters flow ,</l>

     <l n="195">A tun of man in thy large bulk is writ ,</l>

     <l n="199">With whate'er gall thou sett'st thyself to write ,</l>

    <p n="4">This Flecknoe found .— P . 433 .</p>
    <p n="5">Richard Flecknoe , the unfortunate bard whom our author has damned to everlasting fame , was by birth an Irishman , and by profession a Roman Catholic priest . Marvel , who seems to have known him at Rome , describes his person as meagre in the extreme , and his itch for scribbling as incessant . The poem , in which Marvel depicts him , is in the old taste of extravagant burlesque , and the lines are as rugged as Flecknoe could himself have produced . It contains , however , some witty and some humorous description , and the reader may be pleased to see a specimen :</p>
    <p n="6">Flecknoe , an English Priest at Rome .</p>
    <p n="7">Obliged by frequent visits of this man , Whom , as a priest , poet , musician , I for some branch of Melchizedec took , Though he derives himself from my Lord Brooke , I sought his lodging , which is at the sign Of the sad Pelican , subject divine For poetry . There , three stair-cases high , Which signifies his triple property , I found at last a chamber , as ‘ twas said , But seemed a coffin set on the stair 's head , Not higher than seven , nor larger than three feet ; There neither was a ceiling , nor a sheet , Save that the ingenious door did , as you come , Turn in , and show to wainscot half the room ; Yet of his state no man could have complained , There being no bed where he entertained ; And though within this cell so narrow pent , He 'd stanzas for a whole apartement .</p>
    <p n="8">—— —— Nothing now , dinner staid , But till he had himself a body made ; I mean till he were dressed ; for else , so thin He stands , as if he only fed had been With consecrated wafers ; and the host Hath sure more flesh and blood than he can boast . This basso-relievo of a man , Who , as a camel tall , yet easily can The needle 's eye thread without any stitch ; His only impossible is to be rich . Lest his too subtle body , growing rare , Should leave his soul to wander in the air , He therefore circumscribes himself in rhymes , And , swaddled in 's own paper seven times , Wears a close jacket of poetic buff , With which he doth his third dimension stuff . Thus armed underneath , he over all Doth make a primitive sotana fall ; And over that , yet casts an antique cloak , Worn at the first council of Antioch , Which , by the Jews long hid and disesteemed , He heard of by tradition , and redeemed ; But were he not in this black habit decked , This half transparent man would soon reflect Each colour that he past by , and be seen As the camelion , yellow , blue , or green .</p>
    <p n="9">It appears that Flecknoe either laid aside , or disguised , his spiritual character , when he returned to England ; but he still preserved extensive connections with the Roman Catholic nobility and gentry .<span corresp="#note445" type="note_anchor">[ 445 ]</span>He probably wrote upon many occasional subjects , but his poetry has fallen into total oblivion . I have particularly sought in vain for his verses to King John of Portugal , to which Dryden alludes a little lower . Langbaine mentions four of his plays , namely , “ Damoiselles a la Mode , ” “ Erminia , ” “ Love 's Dominion , ” and “ Love 's Kingdom , ” ( of which more hereafter ;) but none of these were ever acted , excepting the last . This gave Flecknoe great indignation , which he thus vents against the players in his preface to “ Damoiselles a la Mode . ” “ For the acting of this comedy , those who have the governing of the stage have their humour , and would be entreated ; and I have mine , and wo n't entreat them : and were all dramatic writers of my mind , they should wear their old plays thread-bare before they should have any new , till they better understood their own interest , and how to distinguish betwixt good and bad . ” Notwithstanding this ill usage , he honoured the players so far , as to prefix to each character , in the dramatis personæ of his pieces , the name of the actor , by whom , had the managers been less inexorable , he meant it should have been performed . But this he did for the sake of the gentle reader , whom he assures , that a lively imagination being thus assisted in bodying forth the character , he may receive as much pleasure from the perusal as from the actual representation of the performance . Flecknoe bore the damnation of the only one of his plays which was represented , with the same valiant indifference with which he supported the rebuffs of the players . In short , he seems to have been fitted for an incorrigible scribbler , by a happy fund of self-satisfaction , upon which neither the censures of criticism , nor the united hisses of a whole nation , could make the slightest impression . When or how Flecknoe died is uncertain , and of very little consequence ; I presume , however , that he was dead when this satire was published . I am uncertain whether the reader will think , that this poor poetaster merited mercy at the hands of Dryden , for the following lines which he had written in his praise , and which , at any rate , may serve as a specimen of Flecknoe 's poetry :</p>
    <p n="10">Dryden , the muses darling and delight , Than whom none ever flew so high a flight : Some have their veins so drossy , as from earth , Their muses only seem to have ta'en their birth . Other but water-poets are , have gone No farther than to the fount of Helicon : And they 're but airy ones , whose muse soars up No higher than to mount Parnassus top ; Whilst thou , with thine , dost seem to have mounted higher Than he who fetch from heaven celestial fire ; And dost as far surpass all others , as Fire does all other elements surpass .</p>
    <p n="11">Flecknoe 's memory being only preserved by this satire , his very name came to be identified with its title . King , in “ A Dialogue in the Shades , ” introduces him under the name of Mac-Flecknoe ; and Derrick falls into the same error .</p>

    <p n="13">Shadwell alone my perfect image bears , Mature in dulness from his tender years .— P . 433 .</p>
    <p n="14">Thomas Shadwell was born at Santon-hall , in Norfolk , in which county his father represented a very ancient family . He was educated at Caius College , in Cambridge , and placed in the Middle Temple to study law ; but , like many of the inhabitants of these buildings , he preferred the smoother paths of literature . He made several essays in heroic verse , all of which are deplorably bad . They are chiefly occasional pieces ; as , an Address to the Prince of Orange on his Landing , another to Queen Mary , and a Translation of the Tenth Satire of Juvenal ; which , though prefaced by a violent refutation of our author 's attacks upon him , is so execrable , as fully to confirm Dryden 's censures of the author 's poetical talents . But , in comedy , he was much more successful ; and , in that capacity , Dryden does him great injustice in pronouncing him a dunce . On the contrary , I think most of Shadwell 's comedies may be read with great pleasure . They do not , indeed , exhibit any brilliancy of wit , or ingenuity of intrigue ; but the characters are truly dramatic , original , and well drawn ; and the picture of manners which they exhibit gives us a lively idea of those of the author 's age . As Shadwell proposed Jonson for his model , peculiarity of character , or what was then technically called humour , was what he chiefly wished to exhibit ; and in this , it cannot be denied that he has often succeeded admirably . His powers , as a dramatist , are highly rated by Rochester , who imputes his coarseness to rapidity of composition :</p>
    <p n="15">Of all our modern wits , none seem to me } Once to have touched upon true comedy , } But hasty Shadwell and slow Wycherley . } Shadwell 's unfinished works do yet impart Great proofs of force of genius , none of art ; With just bold strokes he dashes here and there , Showing great mastery with little care ; Scorning to varnish his good touches o'er , To make the fools and women praise them more .</p>
    <p n="16">Allusion to Tenth Satire of Horace .</p>
    <p n="17">Shadwell 's plays are seventeen in number , and were published , in four volumes , under the inspection of his son , Sir John Shadwell , M. D .</p>
    <p n="18">Shadwell 's life was chequered with misfortune . As he espoused the party of the Duke of Monmouth , to whom he dedicated “ Psyche , ” and of Shaftesbury , he thought himself obliged to draw the quill in defence of their cause . Accordingly , as we have seen , he attempted to answer “ The Medal ” on the one hand , and , on the other , accused our author of intending a parallel between Monmouth and the Duke of Guise , in the play so entitled . This zeal seems to have cost Shadwell dear ; for , besides undergoing the severe flagellations administered by Dryden , in the “ Defence of the Duke of Guise , ” in “ Absalom and Achitophel , ” and in the present poem , he complains , that his ruin was designed , and his life sought ; and that , for near ten years , he was kept from the exercise of that profession which had afforded him a competent subsistence .<span corresp="#note446" type="note_anchor">[ 446 ]</span>It is no wonder , therefore , he was among the first to hail the dawn of the Revolution , by the address already mentioned , of which the full title is , “ A Congratulatory Poem on his Highness the Prince of Orange his coming into England . Written by T. S. ( Thomas Shadwell ,) a True Lover of his Country , ( 10th January ) 1689 ; ” and that King William distinguished him by the honours of the laurel . Dorset , who was high chamberlain , answered , to those who remonstrated on Shadwell 's lack of poetical talent , that , without pretending to vouch for Mr Shadwell 's genius , he was sure he was an honest man . Shadwell did not long enjoy this triumph over his great enemy . He died 19th November , 1692 ,<span corresp="#note447" type="note_anchor">[ 447 ]</span>in the fifty-second year of his age . It is said , this event was hastened by his taking an over dose of opium , to the use of which he was inordinately addicted . “ His death , ” says Dr Nicholas Brady , who preached his funeral sermon , “ seized him suddenly ; but he could not be unprepared , since , to my certain knowledge , he never took a dose of opium but he solemnly recommended himself to God by prayer . ” In person , Shadwell was large , corpulent , and unwieldy ; a circumstance which our author generally keeps in the eye of the reader . He seems to have imitated his prototype , Ben Jonson , in gross and coarse sensual indulgence , and profane conversation . But , if there be truth in a funeral sermon , he must have corrected these habits before his death ; for Dr Brady tells us , “ that our author was a man of great honesty and integrity , and inviolable fidelity and strictness in his word ; an unalterable friendship wherever he professed it ; and however the world may be mistaken in him , he had a much deeper sense of religion than many who pretended more to it . His natural and acquired abilities , ” continues the Doctor , “ made him very amiable to all who knew and conversed with him , a very few being equal in the becoming qualities which adorn and set off a complete gentleman ; his very enemies , if he has now any left , will give him this character , at least if they knew him so thoroughly as I did . ” — CIBBER 'S Lives of the Poets , Article Shadwell , Vol .

    <p n="20">Heywood and Shirley .— P . 434 .</p>
    <p n="21">Voluminous dramatic authors , who flourished in the beginning of the 17th century . There were no less than four Heywoods who wrote plays ; so that , Winstanley says , the name of Heywood seemed to be destinated to the stage . But he whom Dryden here means , is Thomas Heywood , a person rather to be admired for the facility , than for the excellence of his compositions . Every place and situation was alike to him while composing ; and the favourite register of his scenes was the back of a tavern bill . Far the greater part of his labours are now lost ; and yet there remain , in the libraries of the curious , twenty-four printed plays by Thomas Heywood . He was an actor by profession , and a good scholar , as is evinced by several of his classical allusions . His plays may be examined with advantage by the antiquary , but afford slender amusement to the lovers of poetry . The following character of him , by an old poet , is preserved by Langbaine :</p>
    <p n="22">—— —— Heywood sage , The apologetic Atlas of the stage ; Well of the golden age he could entreat , But little of the metal he could get . Threescore sweet babes be fashioned at a lump , For he was christened in Parnassus pump , The muses ’ gossip to Aurora 's bed ; And ever since that time his face was red .</p>
    <p n="23">If we cannot call Heywood a second Lope de Vega , in point of the extent of his dramatic works , he overtops most English authors ; since he assures us , in his preface to the “ English Traveller , ” that it was one reserved among two hundred and twenty plays , in which he had either had “ a whole hand , or , at the least , a main finger . ” It is a pity , as Johnson said of Churchill , so fruitful a tree should have borne only crabs .</p>
    <p n="24">James Shirley , whom our author most unjustly couples with Heywood , to whom , as well as to Shadwell , he was greatly superior , was born in 1594 , and , although for some time a schoolmaster , appears to have lived chiefly by the stage . When the civil wars broke out , he followed the fortune of William , Earl of Newcastle . During the usurpation , when theatres were prohibited , he returned to his original profession of a schoolmaster . He died of fatigue and distress of mind during the great fire of London , in 1666 . He wrote forty-two plays , and there are thirty-nine in print ; a complete set of which is much esteemed by collectors . Dr Farmer has traced , to this neglected bard , an idea , which Milton thought not unworthy of adoption .</p>
    <p n="25">Shirley is spoken of with contempt in “ Mac-Flecknoe , ” but his imagination is sometimes fine to an extraordinary degree . I recollect a passage in the Fourth Book of the “ Paradise Lost , ” which hath been suspected of imitation , as a prettiness below the genius of Milton : I mean , where Uriel glides backward and forward to heaven on a sun-beam . Dr Newton informs us , that this might possibly be hinted by a picture of Annabal Caracci , in the king of France 's cabinet ; but I am apt to believe , that Milton had been struck with a portrait in Shirley . Fernando , in the comedy of the “ Brothers , ” 1652 , describes Jacinta at vespers :</p>
    <p n="26">Her eye did seem to labour with a tear , Which suddenly took birth , but overweighed With its own swelling , dropped upon her bosom ; Which , by reflection of her light , appeared As nature meant her sorrow for an ornament ': After , her looks grew cheerfull , and I saw A smile shoot graceful upward from her eyes , As if they had gained a victory o'er grief ; And with it many beams twisted themselves , Upon whose golden threads the angels walk To and again from heaven .</p>

    <p n="33">I confess myself , after some research , at a loss to discover the nature of the procession , in which Shadwell seems to have acted as leader of the band . One is at first sight led to consider the whole procession as imaginary , and preliminary to his supposed coronation ; but , on closer investigation , it appears , that Flecknoe talks of some real occurrence , on which Shadwell preceded the royal barge , at the head of a boat-load of performers . We may see , in the seventh note , that he professed to understand music , and may certainly have been called upon to assist or direct the band during some entertainment upon the river , an amusement to which King Charles was particularly addicted .</p>

    <p n="36">This seems to be in ridicule of the following elegant expression which Shadwell puts in the mouth of a fine lady : “ Such a fellow as he deserves to be tossed in a blanket . ” This , however , does not occur in “ Epsom-Wells , ” but in another of Shadwell 's comedies , called “ The Sullen Lovers . ”</p>

    <p n="38">Methinks I see the new Arion sail , The lute still trembling underneath thy nail .— P . 434 .</p>
    <p n="39">Shadwell appears to have been a proficient in music , and to have himself adjusted that of his opera of “ Psyche , ” which Dryden here treats with such consummate contempt . Indeed , in the preface of that choice piece he affected to value himself more upon the music than the poetry , as appears from the following passage in the preface : “ I had rather be author of one scene of comedy , like some of Ben Jonson 's , than of all the best plays of this kind , that have been , or ever shall be written ; good comedy requiring much more wit and judgment in the writer , than any rhiming , unnatural plays can do . This I have so little valued , that I have not altered six lines in it since it was first written , which ( except the songs at the marriage of Psyche , in the last scene ) was all done sixteen months since . In all the words which are sung , I did not so much take care of the wit or fancy of them , as the making of them proper for music ; in which I cannot but have some little knowledge , having been bred , for many years of my youth , to some performance in it .</p>
    <p n="40">“ I chalked out the way to the composer , ( in all but the song of Furies and Devils , in the fifth act ,) having designed which line I would have sung by one , which by two , which by three , which by four voices , &amp; c. and what manner of humour I would have in all the vocal music . ”</p>
    <p n="41">Note VIII .</p>
    <p n="42">Not even the feet of thy own Psyche 's rhyme , Though they in number as in sense excel .— P . 435 .</p>
    <p n="43">This unfortunate opera was imitated from the French of Moliere , and finished , as Shadwell assures us , in the space of five weeks . The author having no talents for poetry , and no ear for versification , “ Psyche ” is one of the most contemptible of the frivolous dramatic class to which it belongs . It was , however , got up with extreme magnificence , and received much applause on its first appearance , in 1675 . To justify the censure of Dryden , it is only necessary to quote a few of the verses , taken at random as a specimen , of what he afterwards calls “ Prince Nicander 's vein : ”</p>
    <p n="44">Nicander . Madam , I to this solitude am come , Humbly from you to hear my latest doom .</p>
    <p n="45">Psyche . The first command which I did give , Was , that you should not see me here ; The next command you will receive , Much harsher will to you appear .</p>
    <p n="46">Nic . How long , fair Psyche , shall I sigh in vain ? How long of scorn and cruelty complain ? Your eyes enough have wounded me , You need not add your cruelty . You against me too many weapons chuse , Who am defenceless against each you use .</p>
    <p n="47">The poet himself seems so conscious of the sad inferiority of his verses , that he makes , in the preface , a half apology , implying a mortifying consciousness , that it was necessary to anticipate condemnation , by pleading guilty . “ In a thing written in five weeks , as this was , there must needs be many errors , which I desire true critics to pass by ; and which , perhaps , I see myself , but having much business , and indulging myself with some pleasure too , I have not had leisure to mend them ; nor would it indeed be worth the pains , since there are so many splendid objects in the play , and such variety of diversion , as will not give the audience leave to mind the writing ; and I doubt not but the candid reader will forgive the faults , when he considers , that the great design was to entertain the town with variety of music , curious dancing , splendid scenes , and machines ; and that I do not , nor ever did intend , to value myself upon the writing of this play . ”</p>
    <p n="48">Shadwell , however , had no right to plead , that this affected contempt of his own lyric poetry ought to have disarmed the criticism of Dryden ; because , in the very same preface , he sets out by insinuating , that he could easily have beaten our author on his own strong ground of rhyme , had he thought such a contest worth winning . So much , at least , may be inferred from the following declaration :</p>
    <p n="49">“ In a good-natured country , I doubt not but this , my first essay in rhyme , would be at least forgiven , especially when I promise to offend no more in this kind ; but I am sensible that here I must encounter a great many difficulties . In the first place , ( though I expect more candour from the best writers in rhyme ,) the more moderate of them ( who have yet a numerous party , good judges being very scarce ) are very much offended with me , for leaving my own province of comedy , to invade their dominion of rhyme : but , methinks , they might be satisfied , since I have made but a small incursion , and am resolved to retire . And , were I never so powerful , they should escape me , as the northern people did the Romans ; their craggy barren territories being not worth conquering . ”</p>

    <p n="51">—— Pale with envy , Singleton forswore The lute and sword , which he in triumph bore , And vowed he ne'er would act Villerius more .— P . 435 .</p>
    <p n="52">Singleton was a musical performer of some eminence , and is mentioned as such in one of Shadwell 's comedies .— “ ‘ Sbud , they are the best music in England : there 's the best shawm and bandore , and a fellow that acts Tom of Bedlam to a miracle ; and they sing Charon , oh , gentle Charon ! and , Come , my Daphne , better than Singleton and Clayton did . ” — Bury Fair , Act III . Scene I. Villerius , the grand master of the knights hospitallers , is a principal character in “ The Siege of Rhodes , ” an opera by Sir William D'Avenant , where great part of the dialogue is in a sort of lyrical recitative ; in the execution of which Singleton seems to have been celebrated . The first speech of this valorous chief of the order of St John runs thus :</p>
    <p n="53">Arm , arm ! let our drums beat , To all our outguards , a retreat ; And to our main-guards add Files double lined ; from the parade Send horse to drive the fields , Prevent what ripening summer yields ; To all the foe would save Set fire , or give a secret grave .</p>
    <p n="54">The combination of the lute and sword , which Dryden alludes to , is ridiculed in “ The Rehearsal , ” where Bayes informs his critical friends , that his whole battle is to be represented by two persons ; “ for I make ‘ em both come forth in armour cap-a-pee , with their swords drawn , and hung with a scarlet ribband at their wrists , ( which , you know , represents fighting enough ,) each of them holding a lute in his hand .— Smith . How , sir ; instead of a buckler ?— Bayes . O Lord , O Lord ! instead of a buckler ! Pray , sir , do you ask no more questions . I make ‘ em , sir , play the battle in recitativo ; and here 's the conceit : Just at the very same instant that one sings , the other , sir , recovers you his sword , and puts himself into a warlike posture ; so that you have at once your ear entertained with music and good language , and your eye satisfied with the garb and accoutrements of war . ” — Rehearsal , Act V. The adverse generals enter accordingly , and perform a sort of duet , great part of which is a parody upon the lyrical dialogue of Villerius and the Soldan Solyman , in the “ Siege of Rhodes . ”</p>

    <p n="56">Ancient Decker .— P . 436 .</p>
    <p n="57">Decker , who did not altogether deserve the disgraceful classification which Dryden has here assigned to him , was a writer of the reign of James I ., and the antagonist of Jonson . I suspect Dryden knew , or at least recollected , little more of him , than that he was ridiculed , by his more renowned adversary , under the character of Crispinus , in “ The Poetaster . ” Indeed , nothing can be more unfortunate to an inferior wit , than to be engaged in controversy with an author of established reputation ; since , though he may maintain his ground with his contemporaries , posterity will always judge of him by the character assigned in the writings of his antagonist . Decker was admitted to write in conjunction with Webster , Ford , Brome , and even Massinger ; and though he was only employed to fill up the inferior scenes , he certainly displays some theatrical talent . Indeed he was judged , by many of his own time , to have retaliated Jonson 's satire with success , in “ The Untrussing of the Humorous Poet ; ” where Ben is designed under the character of Horace Junior . Besides , Decker possessed some tragic powers : “ The Honest Whore , ” which is altogether his own production , has several scenes of great merit .</p>

    <p n="59">But worlds of Misers from his pen should flow ; Humorists , and Hypocrites , it should produce , Whole Raymond families , and tribes of Bruce .— P . 436 .</p>
    <p n="60">Shadwell translated , or rather imitated , Moliere 's “ L'Avare , ” under the title of “ The Miser . ” In Langbaine 's opinion , he has greatly improved upon his original ; but in this , as in other cases , the critic is probably singular . “ The Miser ” was printed in 1672 .</p>
    <p n="61">“ The Humorists ” was a play professedly written to expose the reigning vices of the age ; but as it was supposed to contain many direct personal allusions , it was unfavourably received by the audience . Shadwell , by way , I suppose , of insinuating to the readers an accurate notion of the characters , or humours , which he means to represent , is , in this and other pieces , at great pains to give a long and minute account of each individual in the dramatis personæ . Thus we have have in “ The Humorists , ”</p>
    <p n="62">“ Crazy ,— One that is in pox , in debt , and all the misfortunes that can be ; and , in the midst of all , in love with most women , and thinks most women in love with him .</p>
    <p n="63">“ Drybob ,— A fantastic coxcomb , that makes it his business to speak fine things and wit , as he thinks ; and always takes notice , or makes others take notice , of any thing he thinks well said .</p>
    <p n="64">“ Brisk ,— A brisk , airy , fantastic , singing , dancing coxcomb , that sets up for a well-bred man , and a man of honour ; but mistakes in every thing , and values himself only upon the vanity and foppery of gentlemen . ”</p>
    <p n="65">I do not know what to make of the “ Hypocrites . ” Shadwell wrote no play so entitled ; nor is it likely he gave any assistance to Medbourne , who translated the famous “ Tartuffe ” of Moliere , for they were of different opinions in religion and politics . Perhaps Dryden means the characters of the Irish priest and Tory chaplain in “ The Lancashire Witches . ”</p>
    <p n="66">Raymond is a character in “ The Humorists , ” described in the dramatis personæ as a “ gentleman of wit and honour . ” Bruce a similar person in “ The Virtuoso , ” characterized as a “ gentleman of wit and sense . ” In these , and in all other characters where wit and an easy style were requisite , Shadwell failed totally . His forte lay in broad , strong comic painting .</p>

    <p n="69">This gentleman , whose name , thanks to our author and Pope , has become almost proverbial for a bad poet , was originally a Scottish dancing-master , when probably Scottish dancing was not so fashionable as at present , and afterwards master of the revels in Ireland . He translated “ The Iliad , ” “ The Odyssey , ” “ The Æneid , ” and “ Æsop 's Fables , ” into verse ; and his versions were splendidly adorned with sculpture . He also wrote three epic poems , one of which was fortunately burned in the fire of London .

In neither no stiffness , and , I hope , no impertinence nor extravagance , into which your young writers are too apt to run , who , whilst they know not well what to do , and are anxious to do enough , most commonly overdo . ”</p>

    <p n="80">Shadwell 's comedy called “ The Virtuoso , ” was first acted in 1676 with great applause . It is by no means destitute of merit ; though , as in all his other pieces , it is to be found rather in the walk of coarse humour than of elegance , or wit .</p>
    <p n="81">The character of Sir Nicholas Gimcrack , the Virtuoso , whose time was spent in discoveries , although he had never invented any thing so useful as an engine to pare a cream cheese with , is very ludicrous . I cannot , however , but notice , that some of the discoveries , which are ridiculed with so much humour , as the composition of various kinds of air , for example , have been realized by the philosophers of this age . As the whole piece seems intended as a satire on the researches of the Royal Society , its scope could not be very pleasing to Dryden , a zealous member of that learned body ; even if he could have forgiven some hits levelled against him personally in the preface and the epilogue , which have been quoted in the introduction to Mac-Flecknoe .</p>

    <p n="83">Let gentle George in triumph tread the stage , Make Dorimant betray , and Loveit rage ; Let Cully , Cockwood , Fopling , charm the pit .— P . 438 .</p>
    <p n="84">The plays of Sir George Etherege were much admired during the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th century , till the refinement of taste condemned their indecency and immorality . Sir George himself was a courtier of the first rank in the gay court of Charles II . Our author has addressed an epistle to him , when he was Resident at Ratisbon . Etherege followed King James to France , according to one account ; but others say he was killed at Ratisbon by a fall down stairs , after he had been drinking freely . Sir Fopling Flutter , Dorimant , and Loveit , are characters in his well-known comedy , “ The Man of Mode . ” Cully and Cockwood occur in “ Love in a Tub , ” another of his plays .</p>
    <p n="85">Note XV .</p>
    <p n="86">But let no alien Sedley interpose , To lard with wit thy hungry Epsom prose .— P . 438 .</p>
    <p n="87">The first edition bears Sydney , which is evidently a mistake . Shadwell 's comedy of “ Epsom Wells ” was very successful ; which was imputed by his enemies to the assistance he received from the witty Sir Charles Sedley . This he attempts to refute in the following lines of the second prologue , spoken when the piece was represented before the king and queen at Whitehall :</p>
    <p n="88">If this for him had been by others done , After this honour sure they 'd claim their own .</p>
    <p n="89">But it is nevertheless certain , that Shadwell acknowledges obligations of the nature supposed , in the Dedication of the “ True Widow ” to Sir Charles Sedley . “ No success whatever , ” he there says , “ could have made me alter my opinion of this comedy , which had the benefit of your correction and alteration , and the honour of your approbation . And I heartily wish you had given yourself the trouble to have reviewed all my plays , as they came inaccurately , and in haste , from my hands : it would have been more to my advantage than the assistance of Scipio and Lelius was to Terence ; and I should have thought it at least as much to my honour , since , by the effects , I find I cannot but esteem you as much above both of them in wit , as either of them was above you in place of the state . ”</p>
    <p n="90">There was a general opinion current , that Shadwell received assistance in his most successful pieces . A libel of the times , the reference to which I have mislaid , mentions with contempt the dulness of his “ unassisted scenes . ”</p>
    <p n="91">Note XVI .</p>
    <p n="92">Sir Formal , though unsought , attends thy quill , And does thy northern dedications fill .— P . 438 .</p>
    <p n="93">Sir Formal Trifle is a florid conceited orator in “ The Virtuoso , ” whose character is drawn and brought out with no inconsiderable portion of humour . Dryden intimates , that his coxcomical inflated style attends Shadwell himself upon the most serious occasions , and particularly in his dedications to the Duke and Duchess of Newcastle , to whom he has inscribed several of his plays . Hence Dryden , in the “ Vindication of the Duke of Guise , ” calls him the Northern Dedicator . The truth is , that Shadwell 's prose was inflated and embarrassed ; and his adulation comes aukwardly from him , as appears from the opening of the dedication of that very play , “ The Virtuoso , ” to the Duke of Newcastle .</p>
    <p n="94">“ So long as your grace persists in obliging , I must go on in acknowledging ; nor can I let any opportunity pass of telling the world how much I am favoured by you , or any occasion slip of assuring your grace , that all the actions of my life shall be dedicated to your service ; who , by your noble patronage , your generosity and kindness , and your continual bounty , have made me wholly your creature : nor can I forbear to declare , that I am more obliged to your grace than to all mankind . And my misfortune is , I can make no other return , but a declaration of my grateful attachment . ”</p>
    <p n="95">Note XVII .</p>
    <p n="96">Nor let false friends seduce thy mind to fame , By arrogating Jonson 's hostile name .— P . 439 .</p>
    <p n="97">Shadwell , as appears from many passages of his prologues and prefaces , and as we have had repeated occasion to notice , affected to consider Ben Jonson as the object of his emulation . There were indeed many points of resemblance between them , both as authors and men . In their habits , a life spent in taverns , and in their persons , huge corpulence , probably acquired by habits of sensual indulgence , much coarseness of manners , and an ungentlemanly vulgarity of dialect , seem to have distinguished both the original and the imitator . As a dramatist , although Shadwell falls short of the learned vigour and deep erudition of Ben Jonson , his dry hard comic painting entitles him to be considered as an inferior artist of the same school . Dryden more particularly resented Shadwell 's reiterated and affected praises of Jonson , because he had himself censured that writer in the epilogue to the “ Conquest of Granada , ” and in the critical defence of that poem .<span corresp="#note449" type="note_anchor">[ 449 ]</span>Hence he considered Shadwell 's ranking himself under Jonson 's banners as a sort of personal defiance . But Dryden more particularly alludes to the following ebullition of admiration , which occurs in the epilogue to Shadwell 's “ Humorists : ”</p>
    <p n="98">The mighty prince of poets , learned Ben , Who alone dived into the minds of men ; Saw all their wanderings , all their follies knew , And all their vain fantastic passions drew In images so lively and so true , That there each humorist himself might view . Yet only lashed the errors of the times , And ne'er exposed the persons , but the crimes ; And never cared for private frowns , when he Did but chastise public iniquity : He feared no pimp , no pick-pocket , or drab ; He feared no bravo , nor no ruffian 's stab : ‘ Twas he alone true humours understood , And with great wit and judgment made them good . A humour is the bias of the mind , By which with violence ‘ tis one way inclined ; It makes our actions lean on one side still , And in all changes that way bends the will . This ———— He only knew and represented right . Thus none , but mighty Jonson , e'er could write . Expect not then , since that most flourishing age Of Ben , to see true humour on the stage . All that have since been writ , if they be scanned , Are but faint copies from that master 's hand . Our poet now , amongst those petty things , Alas ! his too weak trifling humour brings ; As much beneath the worst in Jonson 's plays , As his great merit is above our praise . For could he imitate that great author right , He would with ease all poets else outwrite . But to outgo all other men , would be , O noble Ben ! less than to follow thee .</p>
    <p n="99">Dryden , in the text , turns the idea of bias into ridicule ; for its original application being to the leaden weight disposed in the centre of a bowl , which inclines its course in rolling , he alleges , that the only bias which can influence Shadwell is his predominant stupidity .</p>
    <p n="100">Note XIX .</p>
    <p n="101">Leave writing plays , and chuse for thy command , Some peaceful province in Acrostic land . There thou may'st wings display , and altars raise , And torture one poor word ten thousand ways .— P . 440 .</p>
    <p n="102">Among other efforts of gentle dulness , may be noticed the singular fashion which prevailed during the earlier period of the 17th century , of writing in such changes of measure , that by the different length and arrangement of the lines , the poem was made to resemble an egg , an altar , a pair of wings , a cross , or some other fanciful figure . This laborious kind of trifling was much akin to the anagrams and acrostics . Those who are curious to read , or rather to see , a specimen of such whimsies , ( for they are rather addressed to the eye than the understanding ,) may find a dirge of Mr George Withers , arranged into the figure of a rhomboid , in Ellis 's “ Specimens of the Early English Poets , ” Vol . III . p. 100 . They are mentioned with anagrams , acrostics , rebuses , and other exercises of false wit , in the “ Spectator , ” No . 63 .</p>
