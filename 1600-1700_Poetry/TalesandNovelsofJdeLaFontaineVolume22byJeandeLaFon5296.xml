    <head>THE PICTURE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">SOLICITED I 've been to give a tale ,</l>
     <l n="2">In which ( though true , decorum must prevail ) ,</l>
     <l n="3">The subject from a picture shall arise ,</l>
     <l n="4">That by a curtain 's kept from vulgar eyes .</l>
     <l n="5">My brain must furnish various features new :</l>
     <l n="6">What 's delicate and smart produce to view ;</l>
     <l n="7">By this expressed , and not by t'other said :</l>
     <l n="8">And all so clear , most easy to be read ,</l>
     <l n="9">By ev'ry fool , without the aid of notes ,</l>
     <l n="10">That idiot 's bad indeed who never quotes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">CATULLUS tells us , ev'ry matron sage</l>
     <l n="12">Will peep most willingly ( whate'er her age ) ,</l>
     <l n="13">At that gigantick gift , which Juno made ,</l>
     <l n="14">To Venus ’ fruit , in gardens oft displayed .</l>
     <l n="15">If any belle recede , and shun the sight ,</l>
     <l n="16">Dissimulation she supposes right .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">THIS principle allowed , why scruples make ?</l>
     <l n="18">Why , less than eyes , should ears a license take ?</l>
     <l n="19">But since ‘ tis so resolved I 'll do my best ,</l>
     <l n="20">And naught in open terms shall be expressed :</l>
     <l n="21">A veil shall over ev'ry charm be cast ,</l>
     <l n="22">Of gauze indeed , and this from first to last ,</l>
     <l n="23">So nicely done , that howsoever tost ,</l>
     <l n="24">To none I trust will any thing be lost .</l>
     <l n="25">Who nicely thinks , and speaks with graceful ease ;</l>
     <l n="26">Can current make just whatsoe'er he please ;</l>
     <l n="27">For all will pass , as I have often known :</l>
     <l n="28">The word well chosen , pardon soon is shown ,</l>
     <l n="29">The sex o'erlook the thing no more the same ,</l>
     <l n="30">The thought remains , but ‘ tis without a name ;</l>
     <l n="31">No blush is raised ; no difficulty found ;</l>
     <l n="32">Yet ev'ry body understands around .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="33">AT present , much I need this useful art :</l>
     <l n="34">Why ? you will ask ; because , when I impart</l>
     <l n="35">Such wondrous circumstances , ev'ry belle ,</l>
     <l n="36">Without reserve , will con them over well .</l>
     <l n="37">To this I answer : female ears are chaste ,</l>
     <l n="38">Though roguish are their eyes , as well as taste .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="39">BE that as ‘ twill , I certainly should like ,</l>
     <l n="40">With freedom to explain , by terms oblique ,</l>
     <l n="41">To belles , how this was broken :— that was down :</l>
     <l n="42">Assist me pray , ye NINE of high renown ;</l>
     <l n="43">But you are maids , and strangers , we agree ,</l>
     <l n="44">To LOVE 'S soft scenes , not knowing A from B .</l>
     <l n="45">Remain then , Muses , never stir an inch ,</l>
     <l n="46">But beg the god of verse , when at a pinch ,</l>
     <l n="47">To help me out and kind assistance lend ,</l>
     <l n="48">To choose expressions which will not offend ,</l>
     <l n="49">Lest I some silly things should chance to say ,</l>
     <l n="50">That might displeasure raise , and spoil my lay .</l>
     <l n="51">Enough , howe'er , we 've on the subject said :</l>
     <l n="52">‘ Tis time we t'wards the painting should be led ,</l>
     <l n="53">Which an adventure you will find contains ,</l>
     <l n="54">That happened once in Cupid 's famed domains .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="55">IN former days , just by Cythera town</l>
     <l n="56">A monastery was , of some renown ,</l>
     <l n="57">With nuns the queens of beauty filled the place ,</l>
     <l n="58">And gay gallants you easily might trace .</l>
     <l n="59">The courtier , citizen , and parson too ,</l>
     <l n="60">The doctor and the bachelor you 'd view ,</l>
     <l n="61">With eager steps :— all visits thither made ;</l>
     <l n="62">And ‘ mong the latter , one ( a pleasing blade )</l>
     <l n="63">Had free access : was thought a prudent friend ,</l>
     <l n="64">Who might to sisters many comforts lend ;</l>
     <l n="65">Was always closely shaved and nicely dressed ;</l>
     <l n="66">And ev'ry thing he said was well expressed ;</l>
     <l n="67">The breath of scandal , howsoever pat ,</l>
     <l n="68">Ne'er lighted on his neat cravat nor hat .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="69">TWO nuns alternatively , from the youth ;</l>
     <l n="70">Experienced many services , in truth ;</l>
     <l n="71">The one had recently a novice been ;</l>
     <l n="72">Few months had passed since she complete was seen ;</l>
     <l n="73">The other still the dress of novice wore ;</l>
     <l n="74">The youngest 's age was seventeen years , not more</l>
     <l n="75">Time doubtless very proper ( to be plain )</l>
     <l n="76">Love 's wily thesis fully to sustain :</l>
     <l n="77">The bachelor so well the fair had taught ,</l>
     <l n="78">And they so earnestly the science sought ,</l>
     <l n="79">That by experience both the art had learned ,</l>
     <l n="80">And ev'ry thing most perfectly discerned .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="81">THESE sisters eagerly had made one day</l>
     <l n="82">An assignation with the lover gay ;</l>
     <l n="83">To have the entertainment quite complete ,</l>
     <l n="84">They 'd Bacchus , Ceres too , who Venus greet :</l>
     <l n="85">With perfect neatness all the meats were served ,</l>
     <l n="86">And naught from grace and elegancy swerved ;</l>
     <l n="87">The wines , the custards , jellies , creams , and ice :</l>
     <l n="88">The decorations , ev'ry thing was nice ;</l>
     <l n="89">What pleasing objects and delights were viewed !</l>
     <l n="90">The room with sweetest flow'rs fair Flora strewed ;</l>
     <l n="91">A sort of garden o'er the linen traced</l>
     <l n="92">Here lakes of love :— there names entwined were placed ;</l>
     <l n="93">Magnificence like this the nuns admired ,</l>
     <l n="94">And such amusements ardently desired .</l>
     <l n="95">Their beauty too incited to be free ;</l>
     <l n="96">A thousand matters filled their souls with glee ;</l>
     <l n="97">In height the belles were pretty much the same</l>
     <l n="98">Like alabaster fair ; of perfect frame ;</l>
     <l n="99">In num'rous corners Cupid nestling lay :</l>
     <l n="100">Beneath a stomacher he 'd slyly play ,</l>
     <l n="101">A veil or scapulary , this or that ,</l>
     <l n="102">Where least the eye of day perceived he sat ,</l>
     <l n="103">Unless a lover called to mystick bow'rs ,</l>
     <l n="104">Where he might hearts entwine with chains of flow'rs ;</l>
     <l n="105">A thousand times a day the urchin flew ,</l>
     <l n="106">With open arms the sisters to pursue ;</l>
     <l n="107">Their charms were such in ev'ry air and look ,</l>
     <l n="108">Both ( one by one ) he for his mother took .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="109">WITH anxious looks , the ladies thus prepared ,</l>
     <l n="110">Expected him who all their kindness shared ;</l>
     <l n="111">Now they bestowed abuse ; next fondly praised :</l>
     <l n="112">Then of his conduct dark suspicions raised ,</l>
     <l n="113">Conceived , a new amour him kept away :</l>
     <l n="114">What can it be , said one , that makes him stay ?</l>
     <l n="115">Of honour an affair .— love — sickness — what ?</l>
     <l n="116">Said t'other whether it be this or that ,</l>
     <l n="117">If here again his face he ever show ,</l>
     <l n="118">A pretty trick in turn we 'll let him know .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="119">WHILE thus the couple sought their plot to frame ,</l>
     <l n="120">A convent porter with a burden came ,</l>
     <l n="121">For her who kept the stores of ev'ry kind ,</l>
     <l n="122">Depositary of the whole designed .</l>
     <l n="123">‘ Twas merely a pretence , as I am told :</l>
     <l n="124">The things were not required for young or old ;</l>
     <l n="125">But she much appetite had got in truth ,</l>
     <l n="126">Which made her have recourse to such a youth ,</l>
     <l n="127">Who was regarded , in repasts like these ,</l>
     <l n="128">A first rate cook that all prepared at ease .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="129">THIS awkward , heavy lout mistook the cell ;</l>
     <l n="130">By chance upon our ladies ’ room he fell ,</l>
     <l n="131">And knocked with weighty hands : they ope 'd the door .</l>
     <l n="132">And gave abuse , but soon their anger o'er ,</l>
     <l n="133">The nuns conceived a treasure they had found ,</l>
     <l n="134">And , laughing heartily , no longer frowned ,</l>
     <l n="135">But both exclaimed at once : let 's take this fool ;</l>
     <l n="136">Of him we easily can make a tool ;</l>
     <l n="137">As well as t'other , do n't you think he 'll do ?</l>
     <l n="138">The eldest added :— let 's our whim pursue ;</l>
     <l n="139">‘ Tis well determined ;— What were we to get ,</l>
     <l n="140">That here we waited , and are waiting yet ?</l>
     <l n="141">Fine words and phrases ; nothing of the kind ;</l>
     <l n="142">This wight ‘ s as good , for what we have a mind ,</l>
     <l n="143">As any bachelor or doctor wise</l>
     <l n="144">At all events , for present , he 'll suffice .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="145">SHE rightly judged ; his height , form , simple air ,</l>
     <l n="146">And ev'ry act , so clearly void of care ,</l>
     <l n="147">Raised expectation ; this was AEsop 's man ,</l>
     <l n="148">He never thought : ‘ twas all without a plan ;</l>
     <l n="149">Both ate and drank , and , had he been at will ,</l>
     <l n="150">Would matters far have pushed , though void of skill .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="151">FAMILIAR grown , the fellow ready seemed ,</l>
     <l n="152">To execute whate'er was proper deemed ;</l>
     <l n="153">To serve the convent he was porter made ,</l>
     <l n="154">And in their wishes nuns of course obeyed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="155">‘ TIS here begins the subject we 've in view ,</l>
     <l n="156">The scene that faithfully our painter drew ;</l>
     <l n="157">Apollo , give me aid , assistance lend ,</l>
     <l n="158">Enable me , I pray , to comprehend ,</l>
     <l n="159">Why this mean stupid rustick sat at ease ,</l>
     <l n="160">And left the sisters ( Claudia , formed to please ,</l>
     <l n="161">And lovely fair Theresa ) all the care ?</l>
     <l n="162">Had he not better done to give a chair ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="163">I THINK I hear the god of verse reply :</l>
     <l n="164">Not quite so fast my friend , you may rely ,</l>
     <l n="165">These matters never can the probe endure ;</l>
     <l n="166">I understand you ; Cupid , to be sure ,</l>
     <l n="167">Is doubtless found a very roguish boy ,</l>
     <l n="168">Who , though he please at times , will oft annoy ;</l>
     <l n="169">I 'm wrong a wicked whelp like this to take ,</l>
     <l n="170">And , master of the ceremonies make .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="171">NO sooner in a house the urchin gets ,</l>
     <l n="172">But rules and laws he at defiance sets ;</l>
     <l n="173">The place of reason whim at once assumes ,</l>
     <l n="174">Breaks ev'ry obstacle , frets , rages , fumes .</l>
     <l n="175">With scenes like these will Cupid oft surprise ,</l>
     <l n="176">And frantick passion sparkle in his eyes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="177">SOON on the floor was seen this boorish wight ;</l>
     <l n="178">For , whether that the chair was rather slight ,</l>
     <l n="179">Or that the composition of the clown</l>
     <l n="180">Was not , like that of geese , of softest down ,</l>
     <l n="181">Or that Theresa , by her gay discourse ,</l>
     <l n="182">Had penetrated to the mystick source ,</l>
     <l n="183">The am'rous pulpit suddenly gave way ,</l>
     <l n="184">And on the ground the rustick quickly lay .</l>
     <l n="185">The first attempt had clearly bad success ,</l>
     <l n="186">And fair Theresa suffered you may guess .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="187">YE censors keep from hence your eyes prophane ;</l>
     <l n="188">See , honest hearts , how Claudia tried amain ,</l>
     <l n="189">To take advantage of the dire mishap ,</l>
     <l n="190">And all she could , with eagerness entrap ;</l>
     <l n="191">For in the fall Theresa lost her hold ;</l>
     <l n="192">The other pushed her :— further off she rolled ;</l>
     <l n="193">And then , what she had quitted Claudia seized ;</l>
     <l n="194">Theresa , like a demon quite displeased ,</l>
     <l n="195">Endeavoured to recover what she 'd lost :—</l>
     <l n="196">Again to take her seat , but she was crossed .</l>
     <l n="197">The sister in possession ne'er inclined</l>
     <l n="198">To cede a post so pleasant to her mind ;</l>
     <l n="199">Theresa raised her hand to give a stroke ;</l>
     <l n="200">And what of that ?— if any thing provoke</l>
     <l n="201">When thus engaged , unheeded it remains</l>
     <l n="202">Small ills are soon forgot where pleasure reigns .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="203">IN spite of rage apparent in the face ;</l>
     <l n="204">Of her who in the scuffle lost her place ,</l>
     <l n="205">The other followed up the road she took ;</l>
     <l n="206">His course the rustick also ne'er forsook .</l>
     <l n="207">Theresa scolded ; anger marked her eyes ;</l>
     <l n="208">In Venus ’ games contentions oft arise ;</l>
     <l n="209">Their violence no parallel has seen :—</l>
     <l n="210">In proof , remember Menelaus ’ queen .</l>
     <l n="211">Though here to take a part Bellona ‘ s found ,</l>
     <l n="212">Of cuirasses I see but few around ;</l>
     <l n="213">When Venus closes with the god of Thrace ,</l>
     <l n="214">Her armour then appears with ev'ry grace .</l>
     <l n="215">The FAIR will understand : enough is said ;</l>
     <l n="216">When beauty 's goddess is to combat led ,</l>
     <l n="217">Her body-cuirass shows superior charms ;</l>
     <l n="218">The Cyclops rarely forge such pleasing arms .</l>
     <l n="219">Had Vulcan graven on Achilles ’ shield</l>
     <l n="220">The picture we 've described , more praise ‘ twould yield .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="221">THE nun 's adventure I in verse have told ,</l>
     <l n="222">But not in colours , like the action , bold ;</l>
     <l n="223">And as the story in the picture fails ,</l>
     <l n="224">The latter seems to lose in my details .</l>
     <l n="225">The pen and brush express not quite the same ;</l>
     <l n="226">Eyes are not ears , however we may aim .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="227">ENTANGLED in the net , I long have left</l>
     <l n="228">The fair Theresa , of her throne bereft ;</l>
     <l n="229">Howe'er , this sister had her turn we find ,</l>
     <l n="230">So much to please , the porter was inclined ,</l>
     <l n="231">That both were satisfied , and felt content ;</l>
     <l n="232">Here ends our tale , and truly I lament ,</l>
     <l n="233">That not a word about the feast is said ,</l>
     <l n="234">Though I 've no doubt , they freely drank and fed ;</l>
     <l n="235">And this for reasons easily conceived :</l>
     <l n="236">The interlude gave rest that much relieved .</l>
     <l n="237">In fine , ‘ twas well throughout , except , in truth ,</l>
     <l n="238">The hour of meeting settled with the youth ,</l>
     <l n="239">Which much embarrasses I will avow ,</l>
     <l n="240">For if he never came and made his bow ,</l>
     <l n="241">The sisters had the means , when they might please ,</l>
     <l n="242">Completely to console themselves at ease ;</l>
     <l n="243">And if the spark appeared , the belles could hide</l>
     <l n="244">Both clown and chair , or any thing beside</l>
     <l n="245">The lover what he wanted soon possessed ,</l>
     <l n="246">And was as usual treated with the best .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A FAMOUS painter , jealous of his wife ;</l>
     <l n="2">Whose charms he valued more than fame or life ,</l>
     <l n="3">When going on a journey used his art ,</l>
     <l n="4">To paint an ASS upon a certain part ,</l>
     <l n="5">( Umbilical , ‘ tis said ) and like a seal :</l>
     <l n="6">Impressive token , nothing thence to steal .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">A BROTHER brush , enamoured of the dame ;</l>
     <l n="8">Now took advantage , and declared his flame :</l>
     <l n="9">The Ass effaced , but God knows how ‘ twas done ;</l>
     <l n="10">Another soon howe'er he had begun ,</l>
     <l n="11">And finished well , upon the very spot ;</l>
     <l n="12">In painting , few more praises ever got ;</l>
     <l n="13">But want of recollection made him place</l>
     <l n="14">A saddle , where before he none could trace .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">THE husband , when returned , desired to look</l>
     <l n="16">At what he drew , when leave he lately took .</l>
     <l n="17">Yes , see my dear , the wily wife replied ,</l>
     <l n="18">The Ass is witness , faithful I abide .</l>
     <l n="19">Zounds ! said the painter , when he got a sight ,—</l>
     <l n="20">What !— you 'd persuade me ev'ry thing is right ?</l>
     <l n="21">I wish the witness you display so well ,</l>
     <l n="22">And him who saddled it , were both in Hell .</l>

    <head>THE EAR-MAKER AND THE MOULD-MENDER</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">WHEN William went from home ( a trader styled ):</l>
     <l n="2">Six months his better half he left with child ,</l>
     <l n="3">A simple , comely , modest , youthful dame ,</l>
     <l n="4">Whose name was Alice ; from Champaign she came .</l>
     <l n="5">Her neighbour Andrew visits now would pay ;</l>
     <l n="6">With what intention , needless ‘ tis to say :</l>
     <l n="7">A master who but rarely spread his net ,</l>
     <l n="8">But , first or last , with full success he met ;</l>
     <l n="9">And cunning was the bird that ‘ scaped his snare ;</l>
     <l n="10">Without surrendering a feather there .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">QUITE raw was Alice ; for his purpose fit ;</l>
     <l n="12">Not overburdened with a store of wit ;</l>
     <l n="13">Of this indeed she could not be accused ,</l>
     <l n="14">And Cupid 's wiles by her were never used ;</l>
     <l n="15">Poor lady , all with her was honest part ,</l>
     <l n="16">And naught she knew of stratagem or art .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">HER husband then away , and she alone ,</l>
     <l n="18">This neighbour came , and in a whining tone ,</l>
     <l n="19">To her observed , when compliments were o'er :—</l>
     <l n="20">I 'm all astonishment , and you deplore ,</l>
     <l n="21">To find that neighbour William 's gone from hence ,</l>
     <l n="22">And left your child 's completing in suspense ,</l>
     <l n="23">Which now you bear within , and much I fear ,</l>
     <l n="24">That when ‘ tis born you 'll find it wants an ear .</l>
     <l n="25">Your looks sufficiently the fact proclaim ,</l>
     <l n="26">For many instances I 've known the same .</l>
     <l n="27">Good heav'ns ! replied the lady in a fright ;</l>
     <l n="28">What say you , pray ?— the infant wo n't be right !</l>
     <l n="29">Shall I be mother to a one-eared child ?</l>
     <l n="30">And know you no relief that 's certain styled ?</l>
     <l n="31">Oh yes , there is , rejoined the crafty knave ,</l>
     <l n="32">From such mishap I can the baby save ;</l>
     <l n="33">Yet solemnly I vow , for none but you</l>
     <l n="34">I 'd undertake the toilsome job to do .</l>
     <l n="35">The ills of others , if I may be plain ,</l>
     <l n="36">Except your husband 's , never give me pain ;</l>
     <l n="37">But him I 'd serve for ever , while I 've breath ;</l>
     <l n="38">To do him good I 'd e'en encounter death .</l>
     <l n="39">Now let us see , without more talk or fears ,</l>
     <l n="40">If I know how to forge the bantling ears .</l>
     <l n="41">Remember , cried the wife , to make them like .</l>
     <l n="42">Leave that to me , said he , I 'll justly strike .</l>
     <l n="43">Then he prepared for work ; the dame gave way ;</l>
     <l n="44">Not difficult she proved :— well pleased she lay ;</l>
     <l n="45">Philosophy was never less required ,</l>
     <l n="46">And Andrew 's process much the fair admired ,</l>
     <l n="47">Who , to his work extreme attention paid ;</l>
     <l n="48">‘ Twas now a tendon ; then a fold he made ,</l>
     <l n="49">Or cartilage , of which he formed enough ,</l>
     <l n="50">And all without complaining of the stuff .</l>
     <l n="51">To-morrow we will polish it , said he :</l>
     <l n="52">Then in perfection soon the whole will be ;</l>
     <l n="53">And from repeating this so oft , you 'll get</l>
     <l n="54">As perfect issue as was ever met .</l>
     <l n="55">I 'm much obliged to you , the wife replied ,</l>
     <l n="56">A friend is good in whom we may confide .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="57">NEXT day , when tardy Time had marked the hour ;</l>
     <l n="58">That Andrew hoped again to use his pow'r ,</l>
     <l n="59">He was not plunged in sleep , but briskly flew ,</l>
     <l n="60">His purpose with the charmer to pursue .</l>
     <l n="61">Said he , all other things aside I 've laid ,</l>
     <l n="62">This ear to finish , and to lend you aid .</l>
     <l n="63">And I , the dame replied , was on the eve ,</l>
     <l n="64">To send and beg you not the job to leave ;</l>
     <l n="65">Above stairs let us go :— away they ran ,</l>
     <l n="66">And quickly recommenced as they began .</l>
     <l n="67">The work so oft was smoothed , that Alice showed</l>
     <l n="68">Some scruples lest the ear he had bestowed</l>
     <l n="69">Should do too much , and to the wily wight ,</l>
     <l n="70">She said , so little you the labour slight ,</l>
     <l n="71">‘ Twere well if ears no more than two appear ;</l>
     <l n="72">Of that , rejoined the other , never fear ;</l>
     <l n="73">I 've guarded thoroughly against defects ,</l>
     <l n="74">Mistake like that shall ne'er your senses vex .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="75">THE ear howe'er was still in hand the same ,</l>
     <l n="76">When from his journey home the husband came .</l>
     <l n="77">Saluted Alice , who with anxious look ,</l>
     <l n="78">Exclaimed ,— your work how finely you forsook ,</l>
     <l n="79">And , but for neighbour Andrew 's kindness here ,</l>
     <l n="80">Our child would incomplete have been — an ear ,</l>
     <l n="81">I could not let a thing remain like this ,</l>
     <l n="82">And Andrew would not be to friends remiss ,</l>
     <l n="83">But , worthy man , he left his thriving trade ,</l>
     <l n="84">And for the babe a proper ear has made .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="85">THE husband , not conceiving how his wife ,</l>
     <l n="86">Could be so weak and ignorant of life ,</l>
     <l n="87">The circumstances made her fully tell ,</l>
     <l n="88">Repeat them o'er and on each action dwell .</l>
     <l n="89">Enraged at length , a pistol by the bed</l>
     <l n="90">He seized and swore at once he 'd shoot her dead .</l>
     <l n="91">The belle with tears replied , howe'er she 'd swerved ,</l>
     <l n="92">Such cruel treatment never she deserved .</l>
     <l n="93">Her innocence , and simple , gentle way ,</l>
     <l n="94">At length appeared his frantick rage to lay .</l>
     <l n="95">What injury , continued she , is done ?</l>
     <l n="96">The strictest scrutiny I would not shun ;</l>
     <l n="97">Your goods and money , ev'ry thing is right ;</l>
     <l n="98">And Andrew told me , nothing he would slight ;</l>
     <l n="99">That you would find much more than you could want ;</l>
     <l n="100">And this I hope to me you 'll freely grant ;</l>
     <l n="101">If falsehood I advance , my life I 'll lose ;</l>
     <l n="102">Your equity , I trust , will me excuse .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="103">A LITTLE cooled , then William thus replied ,</l>
     <l n="104">We 'll say no more ; you have been drawn aside ;</l>
     <l n="105">What passed you fancied acting for the best ,</l>
     <l n="106">And I 'll consent to put the thing at rest ;</l>
     <l n="107">To nothing good such altercations tend ;</l>
     <l n="108">I 've but a word : to that attention lend ;</l>
     <l n="109">Contrive to-morrow that I here entrap</l>
     <l n="110">This fellow who has caused your sad mishap ;</l>
     <l n="111">You 'll utter not a word of what I 've said ;</l>
     <l n="112">Be secret or at once I 'll strike you dead .</l>
     <l n="113">Adroitly you must act : for instance say ;</l>
     <l n="114">I 'm on a second journey gone away ;</l>
     <l n="115">A message or a letter to him send ,</l>
     <l n="116">Soliciting that he 'll on you attend ,</l>
     <l n="117">That something you have got to let him know ;—</l>
     <l n="118">To come , no doubt , the rascal wo n't be slow ;</l>
     <l n="119">Amuse him then with converse most absurd ,</l>
     <l n="120">But of the EAR remember ,— not a word ;</l>
     <l n="121">That 's finished now , and nothing can require ;</l>
     <l n="122">You 'll carefully perform what I desire .</l>
     <l n="123">Poor innocent ! the point she nicely hit ;</l>
     <l n="124">Fear oft gives simpletons a sort of wit .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="125">THE arch gallant arrived ; the husband came</l>
     <l n="126">Ascended to the room where sat his dame ;</l>
     <l n="127">Much noise he made , his coming to announce ;</l>
     <l n="128">The lover , terrified , began to bounce ;</l>
     <l n="129">Now here , now there , no shelter could he meet ;</l>
     <l n="130">Between the bed and wall he put his feet ,</l>
     <l n="131">And lay concealed , while William loudly knocked ;</l>
     <l n="132">Fair Alice readily the door unlocked ,</l>
     <l n="133">And , pointing with her hand , informed the spouse ,</l>
     <l n="134">Where he might easily his rival rouse .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="135">THE husband ev'ry way was armed so well ,</l>
     <l n="136">He four such men as Andrew could repel ;</l>
     <l n="137">In quest of succour howsoe'er he went :</l>
     <l n="138">To kill him surely William never meant ,</l>
     <l n="139">But only take an ear , or what the Turks ,</l>
     <l n="140">Those savage beasts , cut off from Nature 's works ;</l>
     <l n="141">Which doubtless must be infinitely worse</l>
     <l n="142">Infernal practice and continual curse .</l>
     <l n="143">‘ Twas this he whispered should be Andrew 's doom ,</l>
     <l n="144">When with his easy wife he left the room ;</l>
     <l n="145">She nothing durst reply : the door he shut ,</l>
     <l n="146">And our gallant ‘ gan presently to strut ,</l>
     <l n="147">Around and round , believing all was right ,</l>
     <l n="148">And William unacquainted with his plight .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="149">THE latter having well the project weighed ,</l>
     <l n="150">Now changed his plan , and other schemes surveyed ;</l>
     <l n="151">Proposed within himself revenge to take ,</l>
     <l n="152">With less parade :— less noise it then would make ,</l>
     <l n="153">And better fruit the action would produce ,</l>
     <l n="154">Than if he were apparently profuse .</l>
     <l n="155">Said he to Alice , go and seek his wife ;</l>
     <l n="156">To her relate the whole that caused our strife ;</l>
     <l n="157">Minutely all from first to last detail ;</l>
     <l n="158">And then the better on her to prevail ,</l>
     <l n="159">To hasten here , you 'll hint that you have fears ,</l>
     <l n="160">That Andrew risks the loss of — more than ears ,</l>
     <l n="161">For I have punishment severe in view ,</l>
     <l n="162">Which greatly she must wish I should not do ;</l>
     <l n="163">But if an ear-maker , like this , is caught ,</l>
     <l n="164">The worst of chastisement is always sought ;</l>
     <l n="165">Such horrid things as scarcely can be said :</l>
     <l n="166">They make the hair to stand upon the head ;</l>
     <l n="167">That he 's upon the point of suff'ring straight ,</l>
     <l n="168">And only for her presence things await ;</l>
     <l n="169">That though she cannot all proceedings stay ,</l>
     <l n="170">Perhaps she may some portion take away .</l>
     <l n="171">Go , bring her instantly , haste quickly , run ;</l>
     <l n="172">And , if she comes , I 'll pardon what 's been done .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="173">WITH joy to Andrew 's house fair Alice went ;</l>
     <l n="174">The wife to follow her appeared content ;</l>
     <l n="175">Quite out of breath , alone she ran up stairs ,</l>
     <l n="176">And , not perceiving him who shared her cares ;</l>
     <l n="177">Believed he was imprisoned in a room ;</l>
     <l n="178">And while with fear she trembled for his doom ;</l>
     <l n="179">The master ( having laid aside his arms )</l>
     <l n="180">Now came to compliment the lady 's charms ;</l>
     <l n="181">He gave the belle a chair , who looked most nice :—</l>
     <l n="182">Said he , ingratitude 's the worst of vice ;</l>
     <l n="183">To me your husband has been wondrous kind ;</l>
     <l n="184">So many services has done I find ,</l>
     <l n="185">That , ere you leave this house , I 'd wish to make</l>
     <l n="186">A little return , and this you will partake .</l>
     <l n="187">When I was absent from my loving dear ,</l>
     <l n="188">Obligingly he made her babe an ear .</l>
     <l n="189">The compliment of course I must admire ;</l>
     <l n="190">Retaliation is what I desire ,</l>
     <l n="191">And I 've a thought :— your children all have got</l>
     <l n="192">The nose a little short , which is a blot ;</l>
     <l n="193">A fault within the mould no doubt 's the cause ,</l>
     <l n="194">Which I can mend , and any other flaws .</l>
     <l n="195">The business now let 's execute I pray ,</l>
     <l n="196">On which the dame he took without delay ,</l>
     <l n="197">And placed her near where Andrew hid his head ,</l>
     <l n="198">Then ‘ gan to operate as he was led .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="199">THE , lady patiently his process bore ,</l>
     <l n="200">And blessed her stars that Andrew 's risk was o'er</l>
     <l n="201">That she had thus the dire return received ,</l>
     <l n="202">And saved the man for whom her bosom grieved .</l>
     <l n="203">So much emotion William seemed to feel ,</l>
     <l n="204">No grace he gave , but all performed with zeal ;</l>
     <l n="205">Retaliated ev'ry way so well ,</l>
     <l n="206">He measure gave for measure :— ell for ell .</l>
     <l n="207">How true the adage , that revenge is sweet !</l>
     <l n="208">The plan he followed clearly was discrete ;</l>
     <l n="209">For since he wished his honour to repair :—</l>
     <l n="210">Of any better way I 'm not aware .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="211">THE whole without a murmur Andrew viewed ,</l>
     <l n="212">And thanked kind Heav'n that nothing worse ensued ;</l>
     <l n="213">One ear most readily he would have lost ,</l>
     <l n="214">Could he be certain that would pay the cost .</l>
     <l n="215">He thought ‘ twould lucky be , could he get out ,</l>
     <l n="216">For all considered , better ‘ twere no doubt ,</l>
     <l n="217">Howe'er ridiculous the thing appears ,</l>
     <l n="218">To have a pair of horns than lose his ears .</l>
