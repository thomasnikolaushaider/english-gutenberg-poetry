    <docDate>CADENUS AND VANESSA<span corresp="#note1" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span><date>1713</date></docDate>
    <docImprint>The shepherds and the nymphs were seen Pleading before the Cyprian queen . The counsel for the fair began , Accusing the false creature Man . The brief with weighty crimes was charged On which the pleader much enlarged ; That Cupid now has lost his art , Or blunts the point of every dart ;— His altar now no longer smokes , His mother 's aid no youth invokes : This tempts freethinkers to refine , And bring in doubt their powers divine ; Now love is dwindled to intrigue , And marriage grown a money league ; Which crimes aforesaid ( with her leave ) Were ( as he humbly did conceive ) Against our sovereign lady 's peace , Against the statute in that case , Against her dignity and crown : Then pray 'd an answer , and sat down . The nymphs with scorn beheld their foes ; When the defendant 's counsel rose , And , what no lawyer ever lack 'd , With impudence own 'd all the fact ; But , what the gentlest heart would vex , Laid all the fault on t'other sex . That modern love is no such thing As what those ancient poets sing : A fire celestial , chaste , refined , Conceived and kindled in the mind ; Which , having found an equal flame , Unites , and both become the same , In different breasts together burn , Together both to ashes turn . But women now feel no such fire , And only know the gross desire . Their passions move in lower spheres , Where'er caprice or folly steers , A dog , a parrot , or an ape , Or some worse brute in human shape , Engross the fancies of the fair , The few soft moments they can spare , From visits to receive and pay , From scandal , politics , and play ; From fans , and flounces , and brocades , From equipage and park parades , From all the thousand female toys , From every trifle that employs The out or inside of their heads , Between their toilets and their beds . In a dull stream , which moving slow , You hardly see the current flow ; If a small breeze obstruct the course , It whirls about , for want of force , And in its narrow circle gathers Nothing but chaff , and straws , and feathers . The current of a female mind Stops thus , and turns with every wind : Thus whirling round together draws Fools , fops , and rakes , for chaff and straws . Hence we conclude , no women 's hearts Are won by virtue , wit , and parts : Nor are the men of sense to blame , For breasts incapable of flame ; The faults must on the nymphs be placed Grown so corrupted in their taste . The pleader having spoke his best , Had witness ready to attest , Who fairly could on oath depose , When questions on the fact arose , That every article was true ; Nor further those deponents knew : Therefore he humbly would insist , The bill might be with costs dismiss 'd . The cause appear 'd of so much weight , That Venus , from her judgment seat , Desired them not to talk so loud , Else she must interpose a cloud : For if the heavenly folks should know These pleadings in the courts below , That mortals here disdain to love , She ne'er could show her face above ; For gods , their betters , are too wise To value that which men despise . And then , said she , my son and I Must stroll in air , ‘ twixt land and sky ; Or else , shut out from heaven and earth , Fly to the sea , my place of birth : There live with daggled mermaids pent , And keep on fish perpetual Lent . But since the case appear 'd so nice , She thought it best to take advice . The Muses , by the king 's permission , Though foes to love , attend the session , And on the right hand took their places In order ; on the left , the Graces : To whom she might her doubts propose On all emergencies that rose . The Muses oft were seen to frown ; The Graces half ashamed look 'd down ; And ‘ twas observed , there were but few Of either sex among the crew , Whom she or her assessors knew . The goddess soon began to see , Things were not ripe for a decree ; And said , she must consult her books , The lovers ’ Fletas , Bractons , Cokes . First to a dapper clerk she beckon 'd To turn to Ovid , book the second : She then referr 'd them to a place In Virgil , vide Dido 's case : As for Tibullus 's reports , They never pass 'd for law in courts : For Cowley 's briefs , and pleas of Waller , Still their authority was smaller . There was on both sides much to say : She 'd hear the cause another day ; And so she did ; and then a third ; She heard it — there she kept her word : But , with rejoinders or replies , Long bills , and answers stuff 'd with lies , Demur , imparlance , and essoign , The parties ne'er could issue join : For sixteen years the cause was spun , And then stood where it first begun . Now , gentle Clio , sing , or say What Venus meant by this delay ? The goddess much perplex 'd in mind To see her empire thus declined , When first this grand debate arose , Above her wisdom to compose , Conceived a project in her head To work her ends ; which , if it sped , Would show the merits of the cause Far better than consulting laws . In a glad hour Lucina 's aid Produced on earth a wondrous maid , On whom the Queen of Love was bent To try a new experiment . She threw her law-books on the shelf , And thus debated with herself . Since men allege , they ne'er can find Those beauties in a female mind , Which raise a flame that will endure For ever uncorrupt and pure ; If ‘ tis with reason they complain , This infant shall restore my reign . I 'll search where every virtue dwells , From courts inclusive down to cells : What preachers talk , or sages write ; These will I gather and unite , And represent them to mankind Collected in that infant 's mind . This said , she plucks in Heaven 's high bowers A sprig of amaranthine flowers . In nectar thrice infuses bays , Three times refined in Titan 's rays ; Then calls the Graces to her aid , And sprinkles thrice the newborn maid : From whence the tender skin assumes A sweetness above all perfumes : From whence a cleanliness remains , Incapable of outward stains : From whence that decency of mind , So lovely in the female kind , Where not one careless thought intrudes ; Less modest than the speech of prudes ; Where never blush was call 'd in aid , That spurious virtue in a maid , A virtue but at second-hand ; They blush because they understand . The Graces next would act their part , And show 'd but little of their art ; Their work was half already done , The child with native beauty shone ; The outward form no help required : Each , breathing on her thrice , inspired That gentle , soft , engaging air , Which in old times adorn 'd the fair : And said , “ Vanessa be the name By which thou shall be known to fame : Vanessa , by the gods enroll 'd : Her name on earth shall not be told . ” But still the work was not complete ; When Venus thought on a deceit . Drawn by her doves , away she flies , And finds out Pallas in the skies . Dear Pallas , I have been this morn To see a lovely infant born : A boy in yonder isle below , So like my own without his bow , By beauty could your heart be won , You 'd swear it is Apollo 's son ; But it shall ne'er be said , a child So hopeful , has by me been spoil 'd : I have enough besides to spare , And give him wholly to your care . Wisdom 's above suspecting wiles ; The Queen of Learning gravely smiles , Down from Olympus comes with joy , Mistakes Vanessa for a boy ; Then sows within her tender mind Seeds long unknown to womankind : For manly bosoms chiefly fit , The seeds of knowledge , judgment , wit . Her soul was suddenly endued With justice , truth , and fortitude ; With honour , which no breath can stain , Which malice must attack in vain ; With open heart and bounteous hand . But Pallas here was at a stand ; She knew , in our degenerate days , Bare virtue could not live on praise ; That meat must be with money bought : She therefore , upon second thought , Infused , yet as it were by stealth , Some small regard for state and wealth ; Of which , as she grew up , there staid A tincture in the prudent maid : She managed her estate with care , Yet liked three footmen to her chair . But , lest he should neglect his studies Like a young heir , the thrifty goddess ( For fear young master should be spoil 'd ) Would use him like a younger child ; And , after long computing , found ‘ Twould come to just five thousand pound . The Queen of Love was pleased , and proud , To see Vanessa thus endow 'd : She doubted not but such a dame Through every breast would dart a flame , That every rich and lordly swain With pride would drag about her chain ; That scholars would forsake their books , To study bright Vanessa 's looks ; As she advanced , that womankind Would by her model form their mind , And all their conduct would be tried By her , as an unerring guide ; Offending daughters oft would hear Vanessa 's praise rung in their ear : Miss Betty , when she does a fault , Lets fall her knife , or spills the salt , Will thus be by her mother chid , “ ’ Tis what Vanessa never did ! ” Thus by the nymphs and swains adored , My power shall be again restored , And happy lovers bless my reign — So Venus hoped , but hoped in vain . For when in time the Martial Maid Found out the trick that Venus play 'd , She shakes her helm , she knits her brows , And , fired with indignation , vows , To-morrow , ere the setting sun , She 'd all undo that she had done . But in the poets we may find A wholesome law , time out of mind , Had been confirm 'd by Fate 's decree , That gods , of whatsoe'er degree , Resume not what themselves have given , Or any brother god in Heaven : Which keeps the peace among the gods , Or they must always be at odds : And Pallas , if she broke the laws , Must yield her foe the stronger cause ; A shame to one so much adored For wisdom at Jove 's council-board . Besides , she fear 'd the Queen of Love Would meet with better friends above . And though she must with grief reflect , To see a mortal virgin deck 'd With graces hitherto unknown To female breasts , except her own : Yet she would act as best became A goddess of unspotted fame . She knew , by augury divine , Venus would fail in her design : She studied well the point , and found Her foe 's conclusions were not sound , From premises erroneous brought , And therefore the deduction 's naught , And must have contrary effects , To what her treacherous foe expects . In proper season Pallas meets The Queen of Love , whom thus she greets , ( For gods , we are by Homer told , Can in celestial language scold :) — Perfidious goddess ! but in vain You form 'd this project in your brain ; A project for your talents fit , With much deceit and little wit . Thou hast , as thou shall quickly see , Deceived thyself , instead of me ; For how can heavenly wisdom prove An instrument to earthly love ? Know'st thou not yet , that men commence Thy votaries for want of sense ? Nor shall Vanessa be the theme To manage thy abortive scheme : She 'll prove the greatest of thy foes ; And yet I scorn to interpose , But , using neither skill nor force , Leave all things to their natural course . The goddess thus pronounced her doom : When , lo ! Vanessa in her bloom Advanced , like Atalanta 's star , But rarely seen , and seen from far : In a new world with caution slept , Watch 'd all the company she kept , Well knowing , from the books she read , What dangerous paths young virgins tread : Would seldom at the Park appear , Nor saw the play-house twice a year ; Yet , not incurious , was inclined To know the converse of mankind . First issued from perfumers ’ shops , A crowd of fashionable fops : They ask 'd her how she liked the play ; Then told the tattle of the day ; A duel fought last night at two , About a lady — you know who ; Mention 'd a new Italian , come Either from Muscovy or Rome ; Gave hints of who and who 's together ; Then fell to talking of the weather ; Last night was so extremely fine , The ladies walk 'd till after nine : Then , in soft voice and speech absurd , With nonsense every second word , With fustian from exploded plays , They celebrate her beauty 's praise ; Run o'er their cant of stupid lies , And tell the murders of her eyes . With silent scorn Vanessa sat , Scarce listening to their idle chat ; Farther than sometimes by a frown , When they grew pert , to pull them down . At last she spitefully was bent To try their wisdom 's full extent ; And said , she valued nothing less Than titles , figure , shape , and dress ; That merit should be chiefly placed In judgment , knowledge , wit , and taste ; And these , she offer 'd to dispute , Alone distinguish 'd man from brute : That present times have no pretence To virtue , in the noble sense By Greeks and Romans understood , To perish for our country 's good . She named the ancient heroes round , Explain 'd for what they were renown 'd ; Then spoke with censure or applause Of foreign customs , rites , and laws ; Through nature and through art she ranged And gracefully her subject changed ; In vain ! her hearers had no share In all she spoke , except to stare . Their judgment was , upon the whole , — That lady is the dullest soul !— Then tapt their forehead in a jeer , As who should say — She wants it here ! She may be handsome , young , and rich , But none will burn her for a witch ! A party next of glittering dames , From round the purlieus of St. James , Came early , out of pure good will , To see the girl in dishabille . Their clamour , ‘ lighting from their chairs Grew louder all the way up stairs ; At entrance loudest , where they found The room with volumes litter 'd round . Vanessa held Montaigne , and read , While Mrs. Susan comb 'd her head . They call 'd for tea and chocolate , And fell into their usual chat , Discoursing with important face , On ribbons , fans , and gloves , and lace ; Show 'd patterns just from India brought , And gravely ask 'd her what she thought , Whether the red or green were best , And what they cost ? Vanessa guess 'd As came into her fancy first ; Named half the rates , and liked the worst . To scandal next — What awkward thing Was that last Sunday in the ring ? I 'm sorry Mopsa breaks so fast : I said her face would never last . Corinna , with that youthful air , Is thirty , and a bit to spare : Her fondness for a certain earl Began when I was but a girl ! Phillis , who but a month ago Was married to the Tunbridge beau , I saw coquetting t'other night In public with that odious knight ! They rallied next Vanessa 's dress : That gown was made for old Queen Bess . Dear madam , let me see your head : Do n't you intend to put on red ? A petticoat without a hoop ! Sure , you are not ashamed to stoop ! With handsome garters at your knees , No matter what a fellow sees . Filled with disdain , with rage inflamed Both of herself and sex ashamed , The nymph stood silent out of spite , Nor would vouchsafe to set them right . Away the fair detractors went , And gave by turns their censures vent . She 's not so handsome in my eyes : For wit , I wonder where it lies ! She 's fair and clean , and that 's the most : But why proclaim her for a toast ? A baby face ; no life , no airs , But what she learn 'd at country fairs ; Scarce knows what difference is between Rich Flanders lace and Colberteen .<span corresp="#note2" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>I 'll undertake , my little Nancy In flounces has a better fancy ; With all her wit , I would not ask Her judgment how to buy a mask . We begg 'd her but to patch her face , She never hit one proper place ; Which every girl at five years old Can do as soon as she is told . I own , that out-of-fashion stuff Becomes the creature well enough . The girl might pass , if we could get her To know the world a little better . ( To know the world ! a modern phrase For visits , ombre , balls , and plays . ) Thus , to the world 's perpetual shame , The Queen of Beauty lost her aim ; Too late with grief she understood Pallas had done more harm than good ; For great examples are but vain , Where ignorance begets disdain . Both sexes , arm 'd with guilt and spite , Against Vanessa 's power unite : To copy her few nymphs aspired ; Her virtues fewer swains admired . So stars , beyond a certain height , Give mortals neither heat nor light . Yet some of either sex , endow 'd With gifts superior to the crowd , With virtue , knowledge , taste , and wit She condescended to admit : With pleasing arts she could reduce Men 's talents to their proper use ; And with address each genius held To that wherein it most excell 'd ; Thus , making others ’ wisdom known , Could please them , and improve her own . A modest youth said something new ; She placed it in the strongest view . All humble worth she strove to raise , Would not be praised , yet loved to praise . The learned met with free approach , Although they came not in a coach : Some clergy too she would allow , Nor quarrell 'd at their awkward bow ; But this was for Cadenus ’ sake , A gownman of a different make ; Whom Pallas once , Vanessa 's tutor , Had fix 'd on for her coadjutor . But Cupid , full of mischief , longs To vindicate his mother 's wrongs . On Pallas all attempts are vain : One way he knows to give her pain ; Vows on Vanessa 's heart to take Due vengeance , for her patron 's sake ; Those early seeds by Venus sown , In spite of Pallas now were grown ; And Cupid hoped they would improve By time , and ripen into love . The boy made use of all his craft , In vain discharging many a shaft , Pointed at colonels , lords , and beaux : Cadenus warded off the blows ; For , placing still some book betwixt , The darts were in the cover fix 'd , Or , often blunted and recoil 'd , On Plutarch 's Moral struck , were spoil 'd . The Queen of Wisdom could foresee , But not prevent , the Fates ’ decree : And human caution tries in vain To break that adamantine chain . Vanessa , though by Pallas taught , By Love invulnerable thought , Searching in books for wisdom 's aid , Was , in the very search , betray 'd . Cupid , though all his darts were lost , Yet still resolved to spare no cost : He could not answer to his fame The triumphs of that stubborn dame , A nymph so hard to be subdued , Who neither was coquette nor prude . I find , said he , she wants a doctor , Both to adore her , and instruct her : I 'll give her what she most admires Among those venerable sires . Cadenus is a subject fit , Grown old in politics and wit , Caress 'd by ministers of state , Of half mankind the dread and hate . Whate'er vexations love attend , She needs no rivals apprehend . Her sex , with universal voice , Must laugh at her capricious choice . Cadenus many things had writ : Vanessa much esteem 'd his wit , And call 'd for his poetic works : Meantime the boy in secret lurks ; And , while the book was in her hand , The urchin from his private stand Took aim , and shot with all his strength A dart of such prodigious length , It pierced the feeble volume through , And deep transfix 'd her bosom too . Some lines , more moving than the rest , Stuck to the point that pierced her breast , And , borne directly to the heart , With pains unknown increased her smart . Vanessa , not in years a score , Dreams of a gown of forty-four ; Imaginary charms can find In eyes with reading almost blind : Cadenus now no more appears Declined in health , advanced in years . She fancies music in his tongue ; Nor farther looks , but thinks him young . What mariner is not afraid To venture in a ship decay 'd ? What planter will attempt to yoke A sapling with a falling oak ? As years increase , she brighter shines ; Cadenus with each day declines : And he must fall a prey to time , While she continues in her prime . Cadenus , common forms apart , In every scene had kept his heart ; Had sigh 'd and languish 'd , vow 'd and writ , For pastime , or to show his wit , But books , and time , and state affairs , Had spoil 'd his fashionable airs : He now could praise , esteem , approve , But understood not what was love . His conduct might have made him styled A father , and the nymph his child . That innocent delight he took To see the virgin mind her book , Was but the master 's secret joy In school to hear the finest boy . Her knowledge with her fancy grew ; She hourly press 'd for something new ; Ideas came into her mind So fast , his lessons lagg 'd behind ; She reason 'd , without plodding long , Nor ever gave her judgment wrong . But now a sudden change was wrought ; She minds no longer what he taught . Cadenus was amazed to find Such marks of a distracted mind : For , though she seem 'd to listen more To all he spoke , than e'er before , He found her thoughts would absent range , Yet guess 'd not whence could spring the change . And first he modestly conjectures His pupil might be tired with lectures ; Which help 'd to mortify his pride , Yet gave him not the heart to chide : But , in a mild dejected strain , At last he ventured to complain : Said , she should be no longer teazed , Might have her freedom when she pleased ; Was now convinced he acted wrong To hide her from the world so long , And in dull studies to engage One of her tender sex and age ; That every nymph with envy own 'd , How she might shine in the grand monde : And every shepherd was undone To see her cloister 'd like a nun . This was a visionary scheme : He waked , and found it but a dream ; A project far above his skill : For nature must be nature still . If he were bolder than became A scholar to a courtly dame , She might excuse a man of letters ; Thus tutors often treat their better ; And , since his talk offensive grew , He came to take his last adieu . Vanessa , fill 'd with just disdain , Would still her dignity maintain , Instructed from her early years To scorn the art of female tears . Had he employ 'd his time so long To teach her what was right and wrong ; Yet could such notions entertain That all his lectures were in vain ? She own 'd the wandering of her thoughts ; But he must answer for her faults . She well remember 'd to her cost , That all his lessons were not lost . Two maxims she could still produce , And sad experience taught their use ; That virtue , pleased by being shown , Knows nothing which it dares not own ; Can make us without fear disclose Our inmost secrets to our foes ; That common forms were not design 'd Directors to a noble mind . Now , said the nymph , to let you see My actions with your rules agree ; That I can vulgar forms despise , And have no secrets to disguise ; I knew , by what you said and writ , How dangerous things were men of wit ; You caution 'd me against their charms , But never gave me equal arms ; Your lessons found the weakest part , Aim 'd at the head , but reach 'd the heart . Cadenus felt within him rise Shame , disappointment , guilt , surprise . He knew not how to reconcile Such language with her usual style : And yet her words were so exprest , He could not hope she spoke in jest . His thoughts had wholly been confined To form and cultivate her mind . He hardly knew , till he was told , Whether the nymph were young or old ; Had met her in a public place , Without distinguishing her face ; Much less could his declining age Vanessa 's earliest thoughts engage ; And , if her youth indifference met , His person must contempt beget ; Or grant her passion be sincere , How shall his innocence be clear ?<span corresp="#note3" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>Appearances were all so strong , The world must think him in the wrong ; Would say , he made a treacherous use Of wit , to flatter and seduce ; The town would swear , he had betray 'd By magic spells the harmless maid : And every beau would have his joke , That scholars were like other folk ; And , when Platonic flights were over , The tutor turn 'd a mortal lover ! So tender of the young and fair ! It show 'd a true paternal care — Five thousand guineas in her purse ! The doctor might have fancied worse .— Hardly at length he silence broke , And falter 'd every word he spoke ; Interpreting her complaisance , Just as a man sans consequence . She rallied well , he always knew : Her manner now was something new ; And what she spoke was in an air As serious as a tragic player . But those who aim at ridicule Should fix upon some certain rule , Which fairly hints they are in jest , Else he must enter his protest : For let a man be ne'er so wise , He may be caught with sober lies ; A science which he never taught , And , to be free , was dearly bought ; For , take it in its proper light , ‘ Tis just what coxcombs call a bite . But , not to dwell on things minute , Vanessa finish 'd the dispute ; Brought weighty arguments to prove That reason was her guide in love . She thought he had himself described , His doctrines when she first imbibed ; What he had planted , now was grown ; His virtues she might call her own ; As he approves , as he dislikes , Love or contempt her fancy strikes . Self-love , in nature rooted fast , Attends us first , and leaves us last ; Why she likes him , admire not at her ; She loves herself , and that 's the matter . How was her tutor wont to praise The geniuses of ancient days ! ( Those authors he so oft had named , For learning , wit , and wisdom , famed ;) Was struck with love , esteem , and awe , For persons whom he never saw . Suppose Cadenus flourish 'd then , He must adore such godlike men . If one short volume could comprise All that was witty , learn 'd , and wise , How would it be esteem 'd and read , Although the writer long were dead ! If such an author were alive , How all would for his friendship strive , And come in crowds to see his face ! And this she takes to be her case . Cadenus answers every end , The book , the author , and the friend ; The utmost her desires will reach , Is but to learn what he can teach : His converse is a system fit Alone to fill up all her wit ; While every passion of her mind In him is centred and confined . Love can with speech inspire a mute , And taught Vanessa to dispute . This topic , never touch 'd before , Display 'd her eloquence the more : Her knowledge , with such pains acquired , By this new passion grew inspired ; Through this she made all objects pass , Which gave a tincture o'er the mass ; As rivers , though they bend and twine , Still to the sea their course incline : Or , as philosophers , who find Some favourite system to their mind ; In every point to make it fit , Will force all nature to submit . Cadenus , who could ne'er suspect His lessons would have such effect , Or be so artfully applied , Insensibly came on her side . It was an unforeseen event ; Things took a turn he never meant . Whoe'er excels in what we prize , Appears a hero in our eyes ; Each girl , when pleased with what is taught , Will have the teacher in her thought . When miss delights in her spinet , A fiddler may a fortune get ; A blockhead , with melodious voice , In boarding-schools may have his choice : And oft the dancing-master 's art Climbs from the toe to touch the heart . In learning let a nymph delight , The pedant gets a mistress by't . Cadenus , to his grief and shame , Could scarce oppose Vanessa 's flame ; And , though her arguments were strong , At least could hardly wish them wrong . Howe'er it came , he could not tell , But sure she never talk 'd so well . His pride began to interpose ; Preferr 'd before a crowd of beaux ! So bright a nymph to come unsought ! Such wonder by his merit wrought ! ‘ Tis merit must with her prevail ! He never knew her judgment fail ! She noted all she ever read ! And had a most discerning head ! ‘ Tis an old maxim in the schools , That flattery 's the food of fools ; Yet now and then your men of wit Will condescend to take a bit . So when Cadenus could not hide , He chose to justify his pride ; Construing the passion she had shown , Much to her praise , more to his own . Nature in him had merit placed , In her a most judicious taste . Love , hitherto a transient guest , Ne'er held possession of his breast ; So long attending at the gate , Disdain 'd to enter in so late . Love why do we one passion call , When ‘ tis a compound of them all ? Where hot and cold , where sharp and sweet , In all their equipages meet ; Where pleasures mix 'd with pains appear , Sorrow with joy , and hope with fear ; Wherein his dignity and age Forbid Cadenus to engage . But friendship , in its greatest height , A constant , rational delight , On virtue 's basis fix 'd to last , When love allurements long are past , Which gently warms , but cannot burn , He gladly offers in return ; His want of passion will redeem With gratitude , respect , esteem : With what devotion we bestow , When goddesses appear below . While thus Cadenus entertains Vanessa in exalted strains , The nymph in sober words entreats A truce with all sublime conceits ; For why such raptures , flights , and fancies , To her who durst not read romances ? In lofty style to make replies , Which he had taught her to despise ? But when her tutor will affect Devotion , duty , and respect , He fairly abdicates the throne : The government is now her own ; He has a forfeiture incurr 'd ; She vows to take him at his word , And hopes he will not think it strange If both should now their stations change , The nymph will have her turn to be The tutor ; and the pupil , he ; Though she already can discern Her scholar is not apt to learn ; Or wants capacity to reach The science she designs to teach ; Wherein his genius was below The skill of every common beau , Who , though he cannot spell , is wise Enough to read a lady 's eyes , And will each accidental glance Interpret for a kind advance . But what success Vanessa met , Is to the world a secret yet . Whether the nymph , to please her swain , Talks in a high romantic strain ; Or whether he at last descends To act with less seraphic ends ; Or to compound the business , whether They temper love and books together ; Must never to mankind be told , Nor shall the conscious Muse unfold . Meantime the mournful Queen of Love Led but a weary life above . She ventures now to leave the skies , Grown by Vanessa 's conduct wise : For though by one perverse event Pallas had cross 'd her first intent ; Though her design was not obtain 'd : Yet had she much experience gain 'd , And , by the project vainly tried , Could better now the cause decide . She gave due notice , that both parties , Coram Regina , prox ’ die Martis , Should at their peril , without fail , Come and appear , and save their bail . All met ; and , silence thrice proclaimed , One lawyer to each side was named . The judge discover 'd in her face Resentments for her late disgrace ; And full of anger , shame , and grief , Directed them to mind their brief ; Nor spend their time to show their reading : She 'd have a summary proceeding . She gather 'd under every head The sum of what each lawyer said , Gave her own reasons last , and then Decreed the cause against the men . But in a weighty case like this , To show she did not judge amiss , Which evil tongues might else report , She made a speech in open court ; Wherein she grievously complains , “ How she was cheated by the swains ; On whose petition ( humbly showing , That women were not worth the wooing , And that , unless the sex would mend , The race of lovers soon must end ) — She was at Lord knows what expense To form a nymph of wit and sense , A model for her sex design 'd , Who never could one lover find . She saw her favour was misplaced ; The fellows had a wretched taste ; She needs must tell them to their face , They were a stupid , senseless race ; And , were she to begin again , She 'd study to reform the men ; Or add some grains of folly more To women , than they had before , To put them on an equal foot ; And this , or nothing else , would do't . This might their mutual fancy strike ; Since every being loves its like . “ But now , repenting what was done , She left all business to her son ; She put the world in his possession , And let him use it at discretion . ” The crier was order 'd to dismiss The court , who made his last “ O yes ! ” The goddess would no longer wait ; But , rising from her chair of state , Left all below at six and seven , Harness 'd her doves , and flew to Heaven .

    <docTitle><titlePart>In all I wish , how happy should I be , Thou grand Deluder , were it not for thee ! So weak thou art , that fools thy power despise ; And yet so strong , thou triumph'st o'er the wise . Thy traps are laid with such peculiar art , They catch the cautious , let the rash depart . Most nets are fill 'd by want of thought and care But too much thinking brings us to thy snare ; Where , held by thee , in slavery we stay , And throw the pleasing part of life away . But , what does most my indignation move , Discretion ! thou wert ne'er a friend to Love : Thy chief delight is to defeat those arts , By which he kindles mutual flames in hearts ; While the blind loitering God is at his play , Thou steal'st his golden pointed darts away : Those darts which never fail ; and in their stead Convey'st malignant arrows tipt with lead : The heedless God , suspecting no deceits , Shoots on , and thinks he has done wondrous feats ; But the poor nymph , who feels her vitals burn , And from her shepherd can find no return , Laments , and rages at the power divine , When , curst Discretion ! all the fault was thine : Cupid and Hymen thou hast set at odds , And bred such feuds between those kindred gods , That Venus cannot reconcile her sons ; When one appears , away the other runs . The former scales , wherein he used to poise Love against love , and equal joys with joys , Are now fill 'd up with avarice and pride , Where titles , power , and riches , still subside . Then , gentle Venus , to thy father run , And tell him , how thy children are undone : Prepare his bolts to give one fatal blow , And strike Discretion to the shades below .

     <lg>
       <l n="2">The nymph who wrote this in an amorous fit ,</l>
       <l n="3">I cannot but envy the pride of her wit ,</l>
       <l n="4">Which thus she will venture profusely to throw</l>
       <l n="5">On so mean a design , and a subject so low .</l>
       <l n="6">For mean 's her design , and her subject as mean ,</l>
       <l n="7">The first but a rebus , the last but a dean .</l>
       <l n="8">A dean 's but a parson : and what is a rebus ?</l>
       <l n="9">A thing never known to the Muses or Phoebus .</l>
       <l n="10">The corruption of verse ; for , when all is done ,</l>
       <l n="11">It is but a paraphrase made on a pun .</l>
       <l n="12">But a genius like hers no subject can stifle ,</l>
       <l n="13">It shows and discovers itself through a trifle .</l>
       <l n="14">By reading this trifle , I quickly began</l>
       <l n="15">To find her a great wit , but the dean a small man .</l>
       <l n="16">Rich ladies will furnish their garrets with stuff ,</l>
       <l n="17">Which others for mantuas would think fine enough :</l>
       <l n="18">So the wit that is lavishly thrown away here ,</l>
       <l n="19">Might furnish a second-rate poet a year .</l>
       <l n="20">Thus much for the verse , we proceed to the next ,</l>
       <l n="21">Where the nymph has entirely forsaken her text :</l>
       <l n="22">Her fine panegyrics are quite out of season :</l>
       <l n="23">And what she describes to be merit , is treason :</l>
       <l n="24">The changes which faction has made in the state ,</l>
       <l n="25">Have put the dean 's politics quite out of date :</l>
       <l n="26">Now no one regards what he utters with freedom ,</l>
       <l n="27">And , should he write pamphlets , no great man would read ‘ em ;</l>
       <l n="28">And , should want or desert stand in need of his aid ,</l>

       <l n="16">The friend , the mistress , and the wife ,</l>
       <l n="17">Variety we still pursue ,</l>
       <l n="18">In pleasure seek for something new ;</l>
       <l n="19">Or else , comparing with the rest ,</l>
       <l n="20">Take comfort that our own is best ;</l>
       <l n="21">The best we value by the worst ,</l>
       <l n="22">As tradesmen show their trash at first ;</l>
       <l n="23">But his pursuits are at an end ,</l>
       <l n="24">Whom Stella chooses for a friend .</l>
       <l n="25">A poet starving in a garret ,</l>
       <l n="26">Conning all topics like a parrot ,</l>
       <l n="27">Invokes his mistress and his Muse ,</l>
       <l n="28">And stays at home for want of shoes :</l>
       <l n="29">Should but his Muse descending drop</l>
       <l n="30">A slice of bread and mutton-chop ;</l>
       <l n="31">Or kindly , when his credit 's out ,</l>
       <l n="32">Surprise him with a pint of stout ;</l>
       <l n="33">Or patch his broken stocking soles ;</l>

       <l n="35">Exalted in his mighty mind ,</l>
       <l n="36">He flies and leaves the stars behind ;</l>

       <l n="53">True poets can depress and raise ,</l>

       <l n="56">Nor will in panegyric flatter .</l>
       <l n="57">Unjustly poets we asperse ;</l>
       <l n="58">Truth shines the brighter clad in verse ,</l>

       <l n="76">Worn out by wits , who rhyme on faces ;</l>
       <l n="77">Before he could his poem close ,</l>
       <l n="78">The lovely nymph had lost her nose .</l>
       <l n="79">Your virtues safely I commend ;</l>
       <l n="80">They on no accidents depend :</l>
       <l n="81">Let malice look with all her eyes ,</l>
       <l n="82">She dares not say the poet lies .</l>
       <l n="83">Stella , when you these lines transcribe ,</l>
       <l n="84">Lest you should take them for a bribe ,</l>
       <l n="85">Resolved to mortify your pride ,</l>
       <l n="86">I 'll here expose your weaker side .</l>
       <l n="87">Your spirits kindle to a flame ,</l>
       <l n="88">Moved by the lightest touch of blame ;</l>
       <l n="89">And when a friend in kindness tries</l>
       <l n="90">To show you where your error lies ,</l>
       <l n="91">Conviction does but more incense ;</l>
       <l n="92">Perverseness is your whole defence ;</l>
       <l n="93">Truth , judgment , wit , give place to spite ,</l>
       <l n="94">Regardless both of wrong and right ;</l>
       <l n="95">Your virtues all suspended wait ,</l>
       <l n="96">Till time has open 'd reason 's gate ;</l>
       <l n="97">And , what is worse , your passion bends</l>
       <l n="98">Its force against your nearest friends ,</l>
       <l n="99">Which manners , decency , and pride ,</l>
       <l n="100">Have taught from you the world to hide ;</l>
       <l n="101">In vain ; for see , your friend has brought</l>
       <l n="102">To public light your only fault ;</l>
       <l n="103">And yet a fault we often find</l>
       <l n="104">Mix 'd in a noble , generous mind :</l>
       <l n="105">And may compare to Ætna 's fire ,</l>
       <l n="106">Which , though with trembling , all admire ;</l>
       <l n="107">The heat that makes the summit glow ,</l>
       <l n="108">Enriching all the vales below .</l>
       <l n="109">Those who , in warmer climes , complain</l>
       <l n="110">From Phoebus ’ rays they suffer pain ,</l>
       <l n="111">Must own that pain is largely paid</l>
       <l n="112">By generous wines beneath a shade .</l>
       <l n="113">Yet , when I find your passions rise ,</l>
       <l n="114">And anger sparkling in your eyes ,</l>
       <l n="115">I grieve those spirits should be spent ,</l>
       <l n="116">For nobler ends by nature meant .</l>
       <l n="117">One passion , with a different turn ,</l>
       <l n="118">Makes wit inflame , or anger burn :</l>
       <l n="119">So the sun 's heat , with different powers ,</l>
       <l n="120">Ripens the grape , the liquor sours :</l>
       <l n="121">Thus Ajax , when with rage possest ,</l>
       <l n="122">By Pallas breathed into his breast ,</l>
       <l n="123">His valour would no more employ ,</l>
       <l n="124">Which might alone have conquer 'd Troy ;</l>
       <l n="125">But , blinded by resentment , seeks</l>
       <l n="126">For vengeance on his friends the Greeks .</l>
       <l n="127">You think this turbulence of blood</l>
       <l n="128">From stagnating preserves the flood ,</l>
       <l n="129">Which , thus fermenting by degrees ,</l>
       <l n="130">Exalts the spirits , sinks the lees .</l>
       <l n="131">Stella , for once you reason wrong ;</l>
       <l n="132">For , should this ferment last too long ,</l>
       <l n="133">By time subsiding , you may find</l>
       <l n="134">Nothing but acid left behind ;</l>
       <l n="135">From passion you may then be freed ,</l>
       <l n="136">When peevishness and spleen succeed .</l>
       <l n="137">Say , Stella , when you copy next ,</l>
       <l n="138">Will you keep strictly to the text ?</l>
       <l n="139">Dare you let these reproaches stand ,</l>
       <l n="140">And to your failing set your hand ?</l>
       <l n="141">Or , if these lines your anger fire ,</l>
       <l n="142">Shall they in baser flames expire ?</l>
       <l n="143">Whene'er they burn , if burn they must ,</l>
       <l n="144">They 'll prove my accusation just .</l>

     <p>TO STELLA VISITING ME IN MY SICKNESS 1720</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Pallas , observing Stella 's wit</l>
       <l n="2">Was more than for her sex was fit ,</l>
       <l n="3">And that her beauty , soon or late ,</l>
       <l n="4">Might breed confusion in the state ,</l>
       <l n="5">In high concern for human kind ,</l>
       <l n="6">Fix 'd honour in her infant mind .</l>
       <l n="7">But ( not in wrangling to engage</l>
       <l n="8">With such a stupid , vicious age )</l>
       <l n="9">If honour I would here define ,</l>
       <l n="10">It answers faith in things divine .</l>
       <l n="11">As natural life the body warms ,</l>
       <l n="12">And , scholars teach , the soul informs ,</l>
       <l n="13">So honour animates the whole ,</l>
       <l n="14">And is the spirit of the soul .</l>
       <l n="15">Those numerous virtues which the tribe</l>
       <l n="16">Of tedious moralists describe ,</l>
       <l n="17">And by such various titles call ,</l>
       <l n="18">True honour comprehends them all .</l>
       <l n="19">Let melancholy rule supreme ,</l>
       <l n="20">Choler preside , or blood , or phlegm ,</l>
       <l n="21">It makes no difference in the case ,</l>
       <l n="22">Nor is complexion honour 's place .</l>
       <l n="23">But , lest we should for honour take</l>
       <l n="24">The drunken quarrels of a rake :</l>
       <l n="25">Or think it seated in a scar ,</l>
       <l n="26">Or on a proud triumphal car ;</l>
       <l n="27">Or in the payment of a debt</l>
       <l n="28">We lose with sharpers at piquet ;</l>
       <l n="29">Or when a whore , in her vocation ,</l>
       <l n="30">Keeps punctual to an assignation ;</l>
       <l n="31">Or that on which his lordship swears ,</l>
       <l n="32">When vulgar knaves would lose their ears ;</l>
       <l n="33">Let Stella 's fair example preach</l>
       <l n="34">A lesson she alone can teach .</l>
       <l n="35">In points of honour to be tried ,</l>
       <l n="36">All passions must be laid aside :</l>
       <l n="37">Ask no advice , but think alone ;</l>
       <l n="38">Suppose the question not your own .</l>
       <l n="39">How shall I act , is not the case ;</l>
       <l n="40">But how would Brutus in my place ?</l>
       <l n="41">In such a case would Cato bleed ?</l>
       <l n="42">And how would Socrates proceed ?</l>
       <l n="43">Drive all objections from your mind ,</l>
       <l n="44">Else you relapse to human kind :</l>
       <l n="45">Ambition , avarice , and lust ,</l>
       <l n="46">A factious rage , and breach of trust ,</l>
       <l n="47">And flattery tipt with nauseous fleer ,</l>
       <l n="48">And guilty shame , and servile fear ,</l>
       <l n="49">Envy , and cruelty , and pride ,</l>
       <l n="50">Will in your tainted heart preside .</l>
       <l n="51">Heroes and heroines of old ,</l>
       <l n="52">By honour only were enroll 'd</l>
       <l n="53">Among their brethren in the skies ,</l>
       <l n="54">To which ( though late ) shall Stella rise .</l>
       <l n="55">Ten thousand oaths upon record</l>
       <l n="56">Are not so sacred as her word :</l>
       <l n="57">The world shall in its atoms end ,</l>
       <l n="58">Ere Stella can deceive a friend .</l>
       <l n="59">By honour seated in her breast</l>
       <l n="60">She still determines what is best :</l>
       <l n="61">What indignation in her mind</l>
       <l n="62">Against enslavers of mankind !</l>
       <l n="63">Base kings , and ministers of state ,</l>
       <l n="64">Eternal objects of her hate !</l>
       <l n="65">She thinks that nature ne'er design 'd</l>
       <l n="66">Courage to man alone confined .</l>
       <l n="67">Can cowardice her sex adorn ,</l>
       <l n="68">Which most exposes ours to scorn ?</l>
       <l n="69">She wonders where the charm appears</l>
       <l n="70">In Florimel 's affected fears ;</l>
       <l n="71">For Stella never learn 'd the art</l>
       <l n="72">At proper times to scream and start ;</l>
       <l n="73">Nor calls up all the house at night ,</l>
       <l n="74">And swears she saw a thing in white .</l>
       <l n="75">Doll never flies to cut her lace ,</l>
       <l n="76">Or throw cold water in her face ,</l>
       <l n="77">Because she heard a sudden drum ,</l>
       <l n="78">Or found an earwig in a plum .</l>
       <l n="79">Her hearers are amazed from whence</l>
       <l n="80">Proceeds that fund of wit and sense ;</l>
       <l n="81">Which , though her modesty would shroud ,</l>
       <l n="82">Breaks like the sun behind a cloud ;</l>
       <l n="83">While gracefulness its art conceals ,</l>
       <l n="84">And yet through every motion steals .</l>
       <l n="85">Say , Stella , was Prometheus blind ,</l>
       <l n="86">And , forming you , mistook your kind ?</l>
       <l n="87">No ; ‘ twas for you alone he stole</l>
       <l n="88">The fire that forms a manly soul ;</l>
       <l n="89">Then , to complete it every way ,</l>
       <l n="90">He moulded it with female clay :</l>
       <l n="91">To that you owe the nobler flame ,</l>
       <l n="92">To this the beauty of your frame .</l>
       <l n="93">How would Ingratitude delight ,</l>
       <l n="94">And how would Censure glut her spite ,</l>
       <l n="95">If I should Stella 's kindness hide</l>
       <l n="96">In silence , or forget with pride !</l>
       <l n="97">When on my sickly couch I lay ,</l>
       <l n="98">Impatient both of night and day ,</l>
       <l n="99">Lamenting in unmanly strains ,</l>
       <l n="100">Call 'd every power to ease my pains ;</l>
       <l n="101">Then Stella ran to my relief ,</l>
       <l n="102">With cheerful face and inward grief ;</l>
       <l n="103">And , though by Heaven 's severe decree</l>
       <l n="104">She suffers hourly more than me ,</l>
       <l n="105">No cruel master could require ,</l>
       <l n="106">From slaves employ 'd for daily hire ,</l>
       <l n="107">What Stella , by her friendship warm 'd</l>
       <l n="108">With vigour and delight perform 'd :</l>
       <l n="109">My sinking spirits now supplies</l>
       <l n="110">With cordials in her hands and eyes :</l>
       <l n="111">Now with a soft and silent tread</l>
       <l n="112">Unheard she moves about my bed .</l>
       <l n="113">I see her taste each nauseous draught ,</l>
       <l n="114">And so obligingly am caught ;</l>
       <l n="115">I bless the hand from whence they came ,</l>
       <l n="116">Nor dare distort my face for shame .</l>
       <l n="117">Best pattern of true friends ! beware ;</l>
       <l n="118">You pay too dearly for your care ,</l>
       <l n="119">If , while your tenderness secures</l>
       <l n="120">My life , it must endanger yours ;</l>
       <l n="121">For such a fool was never found ,</l>
       <l n="122">Who pull 'd a palace to the ground ,</l>
       <l n="123">Only to have the ruins made</l>
       <l n="124">Materials for a house decay 'd .</l>

      <head>STELLA TO DR . SWIFT ON HIS BIRTH-DAY , NOV. 30 , 1721</head>
       <l n="1">St. Patrick 's Dean , your country 's pride ,</l>
       <l n="2">My early and my only guide ,</l>
       <l n="3">Let me among the rest attend ,</l>
       <l n="4">Your pupil and your humble friend ,</l>
       <l n="5">To celebrate in female strains</l>
       <l n="6">The day that paid your mother 's pains ;</l>
       <l n="7">Descend to take that tribute due</l>
       <l n="8">In gratitude alone to you .</l>
       <l n="9">When men began to call me fair ,</l>
       <l n="10">You interposed your timely care :</l>
       <l n="11">You early taught me to despise</l>
       <l n="12">The ogling of a coxcomb 's eyes ;</l>
       <l n="13">Show 'd where my judgment was misplaced ;</l>
       <l n="14">Refined my fancy and my taste .</l>
       <l n="15">Behold that beauty just decay 'd ,</l>
       <l n="16">Invoking art to nature 's aid :</l>
       <l n="17">Forsook by her admiring train ,</l>
       <l n="18">She spreads her tatter 'd nets in vain ;</l>
       <l n="19">Short was her part upon the stage ;</l>
       <l n="20">Went smoothly on for half a page ;</l>
       <l n="21">Her bloom was gone , she wanted art ,</l>
       <l n="22">As the scene changed , to change her part ;</l>
       <l n="23">She , whom no lover could resist ,</l>
       <l n="24">Before the second act was hiss 'd .</l>
       <l n="25">Such is the fate of female race</l>
       <l n="26">With no endowments but a face ;</l>
       <l n="27">Before the thirtieth year of life ,</l>
       <l n="28">A maid forlorn , or hated wife .</l>
       <l n="29">Stella to you , her tutor , owes</l>
       <l n="30">That she has ne'er resembled those :</l>
       <l n="31">Nor was a burden to mankind</l>
       <l n="32">With half her course of years behind .</l>
       <l n="33">You taught how I might youth prolong ,</l>
       <l n="34">By knowing what was right and wrong ;</l>
       <l n="35">How from my heart to bring supplies</l>
       <l n="36">Of lustre to my fading eyes ;</l>
       <l n="37">How soon a beauteous mind repairs</l>
       <l n="38">The loss of changed or falling hairs ;</l>
       <l n="39">How wit and virtue from within</l>
       <l n="40">Send out a smoothness o'er the skin :</l>
       <l n="41">Your lectures could my fancy fix ,</l>
       <l n="42">And I can please at thirty-six .</l>
       <l n="43">The sight of Chloe at fifteen ,</l>
       <l n="44">Coquetting , gives not me the spleen ;</l>
       <l n="45">The idol now of every fool</l>
       <l n="46">Till time shall make their passions cool ;</l>
       <l n="47">Then tumbling down Time 's steepy hill ,</l>

       <l n="49">O ! turn your precepts into laws ,</l>

       <l n="54">Sacred to friendship , wit , and mirth ;</l>
       <l n="55">Late dying may you cast a shred</l>
       <l n="56">Of your rich mantle o'er my head ;</l>
       <l n="57">To bear with dignity my sorrow ,</l>
       <l n="58">One day alone , then die to-morrow .</l>

      <head>TO STELLA ON HER BIRTH-DAY , 1721-2</head>
       <l n="1">While , Stella , to your lasting praise</l>
       <l n="2">The Muse her annual tribute pays ,</l>
       <l n="3">While I assign myself a task</l>
       <l n="4">Which you expect , but scorn to ask ;</l>
       <l n="5">If I perform this task with pain ,</l>
       <l n="6">Let me of partial fate complain ;</l>
       <l n="7">You every year the debt enlarge ,</l>
       <l n="8">I grow less equal to the charge :</l>
       <l n="9">In you each virtue brighter shines ,</l>
       <l n="10">But my poetic vein declines ;</l>
       <l n="11">My harp will soon in vain be strung ,</l>
       <l n="12">And all your virtues left unsung .</l>
       <l n="13">For none among the upstart race</l>
       <l n="14">Of poets dare assume my place ;</l>
       <l n="15">Your worth will be to them unknown ,</l>
       <l n="16">They must have Stellas of their own ;</l>
       <l n="17">And thus , my stock of wit decay 'd ,</l>
       <l n="18">I dying leave the debt unpaid ,</l>
       <l n="19">Unless Delany , as my heir ,</l>
       <l n="20">Will answer for the whole arrear .</l>

       <l n="15">Resolv 'd my annual verse to pay ,</l>
       <l n="16">By duty bound , on Stella 's day ,</l>
       <l n="17">Furnish 'd with paper , pens , and ink ,</l>
       <l n="18">I gravely sat me down to think :</l>
       <l n="19">I bit my nails , and scratch 'd my head ,</l>
       <l n="20">But found my wit and fancy fled :</l>
       <l n="21">Or if , with more than usual pain ,</l>
       <l n="22">A thought came slowly from my brain ,</l>
       <l n="23">It cost me Lord knows how much time</l>
       <l n="24">To shape it into sense and rhyme :</l>
       <l n="25">And , what was yet a greater curse ,</l>
       <l n="26">Long thinking made my fancy worse .</l>
       <l n="27">Forsaken by th'inspiring Nine ,</l>
       <l n="28">I waited at Apollo 's shrine :</l>
       <l n="29">I told him what the world would say ,</l>
       <l n="30">If Stella were unsung to-day :</l>
       <l n="31">How I should hide my head for shame ,</l>
       <l n="32">When both the Jacks and Robin came ;</l>
       <l n="33">How Ford would frown , how Jim would leer ,</l>
       <l n="34">How Sheridan the rogue would sneer ,</l>
       <l n="35">And swear it does not always follow ,</l>
       <l n="36">That semel'n anno ridet Apollo .</l>
       <l n="37">I have assur 'd them twenty times ,</l>
       <l n="38">That Phoebus help 'd me in my rhymes ;</l>
       <l n="39">Phoebus inspired me from above ,</l>
       <l n="40">And he and I were hand and glove .</l>
       <l n="41">But , finding me so dull and dry since ,</l>
       <l n="42">They 'll call it all poetic license ;</l>
       <l n="43">And when I brag of aid divine ,</l>
       <l n="44">Think Eusden 's<span corresp="#note1_6" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>right as good as mine .</l>
       <l n="45">Nor do I ask for Stella 's sake ;</l>
       <l n="46">‘ Tis my own credit lies at stake :</l>
       <l n="47">And Stella will be sung , while I</l>
       <l n="48">Can only be a stander by .</l>
       <l n="49">Apollo , having thought a little ,</l>
       <l n="50">Return 'd this answer to a tittle .</l>
       <l n="51">Though you should live like old Methusalem ,</l>
       <l n="52">I furnish hints and you shall use all ‘ em ,</l>
       <l n="53">You yearly sing as she grows old ,</l>
       <l n="54">You 'd leave her virtues half untold .</l>
       <l n="55">But , to say truth , such dulness reigns ,</l>

       <l n="1">Don Carlos , in a merry spight ,</l>
       <l n="2">Did Stella to his house invite :</l>
       <l n="3">He entertain 'd her half a year</l>
       <l n="4">With generous wines and costly cheer .</l>
       <l n="5">Don Carlos made her chief director ,</l>
       <l n="6">That she might o'er the servants hector .</l>
       <l n="7">In half a week the dame grew nice ,</l>
       <l n="8">Got all things at the highest price :</l>
       <l n="9">Now at the table head she sits ,</l>
       <l n="10">Presented with the nicest bits :</l>
       <l n="11">She look 'd on partridges with scorn ,</l>
       <l n="12">Except they tasted of the corn :</l>
       <l n="13">A haunch of ven'son made her sweat ,</l>
       <l n="14">Unless it had the right fumette .</l>
       <l n="15">Don Carlos earnestly would beg ,</l>
       <l n="16">“ Dear Madam , try this pigeon 's leg ; ”</l>
       <l n="17">Was happy , when he could prevail</l>
       <l n="18">To make her only touch a quail .</l>
       <l n="19">Through candle-light she view 'd the wine ,</l>
       <l n="20">To see that ev'ry glass was fine .</l>
       <l n="21">At last , grown prouder than the devil</l>
       <l n="22">With feeding high , and treatment civil ,</l>
       <l n="23">Don Carlos now began to find</l>
       <l n="24">His malice work as he design 'd .</l>
       <l n="25">The winter sky began to frown :</l>
       <l n="26">Poor Stella must pack off to town ;</l>
       <l n="27">From purling streams and fountains bubbling ,</l>
       <l n="28">To Liffey 's stinking tide in Dublin :</l>
       <l n="29">From wholesome exercise and air</l>
       <l n="30">To sossing in an easy-chair :</l>
       <l n="31">From stomach sharp , and hearty feeding ,</l>
       <l n="32">To piddle<span corresp="#note2_6" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>like a lady breeding :</l>
       <l n="33">From ruling there the household singly .</l>
       <l n="34">To be directed here by Dingley :[ 3 ]</l>
       <l n="35">From every day a lordly banquet ,</l>
       <l n="36">To half a joint , and God be thank it :</l>
       <l n="37">From every meal Pontac in plenty ,</l>
       <l n="38">To half a pint one day in twenty :</l>
       <l n="39">From Ford attending at her call ,</l>
       <l n="40">To visits of Archdeacon Wall :</l>
       <l n="41">From Ford , who thinks of nothing mean ,</l>
       <l n="42">To the poor doings of the Dean :</l>
       <l n="43">From growing richer with good cheer ,</l>
       <l n="44">To running out by starving here .</l>
       <l n="45">But now arrives the dismal day ;</l>
       <l n="46">She must return to Ormond Quay .<span corresp="#note4" type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span></l>
       <l n="47">The coachman stopt ; she look 'd , and swore</l>
       <l n="48">The rascal had mistook the door :</l>
       <l n="49">At coming in , you saw her stoop ;</l>
       <l n="50">The entry brush 'd against her hoop :</l>
       <l n="51">Each moment rising in her airs ,</l>
       <l n="52">She curst the narrow winding stairs :</l>
       <l n="53">Began a thousand faults to spy ;</l>
       <l n="54">The ceiling hardly six feet high ;</l>
       <l n="55">The smutty wainscot full of cracks :</l>
       <l n="56">And half the chairs with broken backs :</l>
       <l n="57">Her quarter 's out at Lady-day ;</l>
       <l n="58">She vows she will no longer stay</l>
       <l n="59">In lodgings like a poor Grisette ,</l>
       <l n="60">While there are houses to be let .</l>
       <l n="61">Howe'er , to keep her spirits up ,</l>
       <l n="62">She sent for company to sup :</l>
       <l n="63">When all the while you might remark ,</l>
       <l n="64">She strove in vain to ape Wood Park .</l>
       <l n="65">Two bottles call 'd for , ( half her store ,</l>
       <l n="66">The cupboard could contain but four :)</l>
       <l n="67">A supper worthy of herself ,</l>
       <l n="68">Five nothings in five plates of delf .</l>
       <l n="69">Thus for a week the farce went on ;</l>
       <l n="70">When , all her country savings gone ,</l>
       <l n="71">She fell into her former scene ,</l>
       <l n="72">Small beer , a herring , and the Dean .</l>
       <l n="73">Thus far in jest : though now , I fear ,</l>
       <l n="74">You think my jesting too severe ;</l>
       <l n="75">But poets , when a hint is new ,</l>
       <l n="76">Regard not whether false or true :</l>
       <l n="77">Yet raillery gives no offence ,</l>
       <l n="78">Where truth has not the least pretence ;</l>
       <l n="79">Nor can be more securely placed</l>
       <l n="80">Than on a nymph of Stella 's taste .</l>
       <l n="81">I must confess your wine and vittle</l>
       <l n="82">I was too hard upon a little :</l>
       <l n="83">Your table neat , your linen fine ;</l>
       <l n="84">And , though in miniature , you shine :</l>
       <l n="85">Yet , when you sigh to leave Wood Park ,</l>
       <l n="86">The scene , the welcome , and the spark ,</l>
       <l n="87">To languish in this odious town ,</l>
       <l n="88">And pull your haughty stomach down ,</l>
       <l n="89">We think you quite mistake the case ,</l>
       <l n="90">The virtue lies not in the place :</l>
       <l n="91">For though my raillery were true ,</l>
       <l n="92">A cottage is Wood Park with you .</l>

       <l n="3">Tormented with incessant pains ,</l>

       <l n="5">Must let their cattle range in vain</l>
       <l n="6">For food along the barren plain :</l>
       <l n="7">Meagre and lank with fasting grown ,</l>

       <l n="9">Exposed to want , and wind , and weather ,</l>

       <l n="1">As when a beauteous nymph decays ,</l>
       <l n="2">We say she 's past her dancing days ;</l>
       <l n="3">So poets lose their feet by time ,</l>
       <l n="4">And can no longer dance in rhyme .</l>
       <l n="5">Your annual bard had rather chose</l>
       <l n="6">To celebrate your birth in prose :</l>
       <l n="7">Yet merry folks , who want by chance</l>
       <l n="8">A pair to make a country dance ,</l>
       <l n="9">Call the old housekeeper , and get her</l>
       <l n="10">To fill a place for want of better :</l>
       <l n="11">While Sheridan is off the hooks ,</l>
       <l n="12">And friend Delany at his books ,</l>
       <l n="13">That Stella may avoid disgrace ,</l>
       <l n="14">Once more the Dean supplies their place .</l>
       <l n="15">Beauty and wit , too sad a truth !</l>
       <l n="16">Have always been confined to youth ;</l>
       <l n="17">The god of wit and beauty 's queen ,</l>
       <l n="18">He twenty-one and she fifteen ,</l>
       <l n="19">No poet ever sweetly sung ,</l>
       <l n="20">Unless he were , like Phoebus , young ;</l>
       <l n="21">Nor ever nymph inspired to rhyme ,</l>
       <l n="22">Unless , like Venus , in her prime .</l>
       <l n="23">At fifty-six , if this be true ,</l>
       <l n="24">Am I a poet fit for you ?</l>
       <l n="25">Or , at the age of forty-three ,</l>
       <l n="26">Are you a subject fit for me ?</l>
       <l n="27">Adieu ! bright wit , and radiant eyes !</l>
       <l n="28">You must be grave and I be wise .</l>
       <l n="29">Our fate in vain we would oppose :</l>

       <l n="31">Esteem and friendship to express ,</l>
       <l n="32">Will not require poetic dress ;</l>
       <l n="33">And if the Muse deny her aid</l>
       <l n="34">To have them sung , they may be said .</l>
       <l n="35">But , Stella , say , what evil tongue</l>
       <l n="36">Reports you are no longer young ;</l>
       <l n="37">That Time sits with his scythe to mow</l>
       <l n="38">Where erst sat Cupid with his bow ;</l>
       <l n="39">That half your locks are turn 'd to gray ?</l>
       <l n="40">I 'll ne'er believe a word they say .</l>
       <l n="41">‘ Tis true , but let it not be known ,</l>
       <l n="42">My eyes are somewhat dimmish grown ;</l>
       <l n="43">For nature , always in the right ,</l>
       <l n="44">To your decays adapts my sight ;</l>
       <l n="45">And wrinkles undistinguished pass ,</l>
       <l n="46">For I 'm ashamed to use a glass :</l>

       <l n="48">Whoever says you have them , lies .</l>
       <l n="49">No length of time can make you quit</l>
       <l n="50">Honour and virtue , sense and wit ;</l>
       <l n="51">Thus you may still be young to me ,</l>

     <lg>
       <l n="1">This day , dear Bec , is thy nativity ;</l>
       <l n="2">Had Fate a luckier one , she 'd give it ye .</l>
       <l n="3">She chose a thread of greatest length ,</l>
       <l n="4">And doubly twisted it for strength :</l>
       <l n="5">Nor will be able with her shears</l>
       <l n="6">To cut it off these forty years .</l>
       <l n="7">Then who says care will kill a cat ?</l>
       <l n="8">Rebecca shows they 're out in that .</l>
       <l n="9">For she , though overrun with care ,</l>
       <l n="10">Continues healthy , fat , and fair .</l>
       <l n="11">As , if the gout should seize the head ,</l>
       <l n="12">Doctors pronounce the patient dead ;</l>
       <l n="13">But , if they can , by all their arts ,</l>
       <l n="14">Eject it to the extremest parts ,</l>
       <l n="15">They give the sick man joy , and praise</l>
       <l n="16">The gout that will prolong his days .</l>
       <l n="17">Rebecca thus I gladly greet ,</l>
       <l n="18">Who drives her cares to hands and feet :</l>
       <l n="19">For , though philosophers maintain</l>
       <l n="20">The limbs are guided by the brain ,</l>
       <l n="21">Quite contrary Rebecca 's led ;</l>
       <l n="22">Her hands and feet conduct her head ;</l>
       <l n="23">By arbitrary power convey her ,</l>
       <l n="24">She ne'er considers why or where :</l>
       <l n="25">Her hands may meddle , feet may wander ,</l>
       <l n="26">Her head is but a mere by-stander :</l>
       <l n="27">And all her bustling but supplies</l>
       <l n="28">The part of wholesome exercise .</l>
       <l n="29">Thus nature has resolved to pay her</l>
       <l n="30">The cat 's nine lives , and eke the care .</l>
       <l n="31">Long may she live , and help her friends</l>
       <l n="32">Whene'er it suits her private ends ;</l>
       <l n="33">Domestic business never mind</l>
       <l n="34">Till coffee has her stomach lined ;</l>
       <l n="35">But , when her breakfast gives her courage ,</l>
       <l n="36">Then think on Stella 's chicken porridge :</l>
       <l n="37">I mean when Tiger<span corresp="#note2_9" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>has been served ,</l>
       <l n="38">Or else poor Stella may be starved .</l>
       <l n="39">May Bec have many an evening nap ,</l>
       <l n="40">With Tiger slabbering in her lap ;</l>
       <l n="41">But always take a special care</l>
       <l n="42">She does not overset the chair ;</l>
       <l n="43">Still be she curious , never hearken</l>
       <l n="44">To any speech but Tiger 's barking !</l>
       <l n="45">And when she 's in another scene ,</l>
       <l n="46">Stella long dead , but first the Dean ,</l>
       <l n="47">May fortune and her coffee get her</l>
       <l n="48">Companions that will please her better !</l>
       <l n="49">Whole afternoons will sit beside her ,</l>
       <l n="50">Nor for neglects or blunders chide her .</l>
       <l n="51">A goodly set as can be found</l>
       <l n="52">Of hearty gossips prating round ;</l>
       <l n="53">Fresh from a wedding or a christening ,</l>
       <l n="54">To teach her ears the art of listening ,</l>
       <l n="55">And please her more to hear them tattle ,</l>
       <l n="56">Than the Dean storm , or Stella rattle .</l>
       <l n="57">Late be her death , one gentle nod ,</l>
       <l n="58">When Hermes ,<span corresp="#note3_6" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>waiting with his rod ,</l>
       <l n="59">Shall to Elysian fields invite her ,</l>
       <l n="60">Where there will be no cares to fright her !</l>

       <l n="13">From not the gravest of divines</l>

       <l n="19">Were future happiness and pain</l>
       <l n="20">A mere contrivance of the brain ;</l>

       <l n="46">To merit humbled in the dust ;</l>
       <l n="47">The detestation you express</l>
       <l n="48">For vice in all its glittering dress ;</l>

       <l n="52">Or forms reflected from a glass ?</l>
       <l n="53">Or mere chimeras in the mind ,</l>
       <l n="54">That fly , and leave no marks behind ?</l>
       <l n="55">Does not the body thrive and grow</l>
       <l n="56">By food of twenty years ago ?</l>
       <l n="57">And , had it not been still supplied ,</l>
       <l n="58">It must a thousand times have died .</l>
       <l n="59">Then who with reason can maintain</l>
       <l n="60">That no effects of food remain ?</l>
       <l n="61">And is not virtue in mankind</l>
       <l n="62">The nutriment that feeds the mind ;</l>
       <l n="63">Upheld by each good action past ,</l>
       <l n="64">And still continued by the last ?</l>
       <l n="65">Then , who with reason can pretend</l>
       <l n="66">That all effects of virtue end ?</l>
       <l n="67">Believe me , Stella , when you show</l>
       <l n="68">That true contempt for things below ,</l>
       <l n="69">Nor prize your life for other ends ,</l>
       <l n="70">Than merely to oblige your friends ;</l>
       <l n="71">Your former actions claim their part ,</l>
       <l n="72">And join to fortify your heart .</l>
       <l n="73">For Virtue , in her daily race ,</l>
       <l n="74">Like Janus , bears a double face ;</l>
       <l n="75">Looks back with joy where she has gone</l>
       <l n="76">And therefore goes with courage on :</l>
       <l n="77">She at your sickly couch will wait ,</l>
       <l n="78">And guide you to a better state .</l>
       <l n="79">O then , whatever Heaven intends ,</l>
       <l n="80">Take pity on your pitying friends !</l>
       <l n="81">Nor let your ills affect your mind ,</l>
       <l n="82">To fancy they can be unkind .</l>
       <l n="83">Me , surely me , you ought to spare ,</l>
       <l n="84">Who gladly would your suffering share ;</l>
       <l n="85">Or give my scrap of life to you ,</l>
       <l n="86">And think it far beneath your due ;</l>
       <l n="87">You , to whose care so oft I owe</l>
       <l n="88">That I 'm alive to tell you so .</l>

      <head>DEATH AND DAPHNE</head>
      <head>TO AN AGREEABLE YOUNG LADY , BUT EXTREMELY LEAN . 1730</head>
       <l n="1">Lord Orrery gives us the following curious anecdote respecting this</l>
       <l n="2">poem :</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ I have just now cast my eye over a poem called ‘ Death and Daphne ,’ which makes me recollect an odd incident , relating to that nymph . Swift , soon after our acquaintance , introduced me to her as to one of his female favourites . I had scarce been half an hour in her company , before she asked me if I had seen the Dean 's poem upon ‘ Death and Daphne . ’ As I told her I had not , she immediately unlocked a cabinet , and , bringing out the manuscript , read it to me with a seeming satisfaction , of which , at that time , I doubted the sincerity . While she was reading , the Dean was perpetually correcting her for bad pronunciation , and for placing a wrong emphasis upon particular words . As soon as she had gone through the composition , she assured me , smilingly , that the portrait of Daphne was drawn for herself . I begged to be excused from believing it ; and protested that I could not see one feature that had the least resemblance ; but the Dean immediately burst into a fit of laughter . ‘ You fancy , ’ says he , ‘ that you are very polite , but you are much mistaken . That lady had rather be a Daphne drawn by me , than a Sacharissa by any other pencil . ’ She confirmed what he had said with great earnestness , so that I had no other method of retrieving my error , than by whispering in her ear , as I was conducting her down stairs to dinner , that indeed I found ‘ Her hand as dry and cold as lead ! ’ ” — Remarks on the Life of Swift , Lond ., 1752 , p. 126 .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Death went upon a solemn day</l>
       <l n="2">At Pluto 's hall his court to pay ;</l>
       <l n="3">The phantom having humbly kiss 'd</l>
       <l n="4">His grisly monarch 's sooty fist ,</l>
       <l n="5">Presented him the weekly bills</l>
       <l n="6">Of doctors , fevers , plagues , and pills .</l>
       <l n="7">Pluto , observing since the peace</l>
       <l n="8">The burial article decrease ,</l>
       <l n="9">And vex 'd to see affairs miscarry ,</l>
       <l n="10">Declared in council Death must marry ;</l>
       <l n="11">Vow 'd he no longer could support</l>
       <l n="12">Old bachelors about his court ;</l>
       <l n="13">The interest of his realm had need</l>
       <l n="14">That Death should get a numerous breed ;</l>
       <l n="15">Young deathlings , who , by practice made</l>
       <l n="16">Proficient in their father 's trade ,</l>
       <l n="17">With colonies might stock around</l>
       <l n="18">His large dominions under ground .</l>
       <l n="19">A consult of coquettes below</l>
       <l n="20">Was call 'd , to rig him out a beau ;</l>
       <l n="21">From her own head Megaera<span corresp="#note1_13" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>takes</l>
       <l n="22">A periwig of twisted snakes :</l>
       <l n="23">Which in the nicest fashion curl 'd ,</l>
       <l n="24">( Like toupees<span corresp="#note2_10" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>of this upper world )</l>
       <l n="25">With flower of sulphur powder 'd well ,</l>
       <l n="26">That graceful on his shoulders fell ;</l>
       <l n="27">An adder of the sable kind</l>
       <l n="28">In line direct hung down behind :</l>
       <l n="29">The owl , the raven , and the bat ,</l>
       <l n="30">Clubb 'd for a feather to his hat :</l>
       <l n="31">His coat , a usurer 's velvet pall ,</l>
       <l n="32">Bequeath 'd to Pluto , corpse and all .</l>
       <l n="33">But , loath his person to expose</l>
       <l n="34">Bare , like a carcass pick 'd by crows ,</l>
       <l n="35">A lawyer , o'er his hands and face</l>
       <l n="36">Stuck artfully a parchment case .</l>
       <l n="37">No new flux 'd rake show 'd fairer skin ;</l>
       <l n="38">Nor Phyllis after lying in .</l>
       <l n="39">With snuff was fill 'd his ebon box ,</l>
       <l n="40">Of shin-bones rotted by the pox .</l>
       <l n="41">Nine spirits of blaspheming fops ,</l>
       <l n="42">With aconite anoint his chops ;</l>
       <l n="43">And give him words of dreadful sounds ,</l>
       <l n="44">G — d d — n his blood ! and b — d and w — ds ! ’</l>
       <l n="45">Thus furnish 'd out , he sent his train</l>
       <l n="46">To take a house in Warwick-lane :[ 3 ]</l>
       <l n="47">The faculty , his humble friends ,</l>
       <l n="48">A complimental message sends :</l>
       <l n="49">Their president in scarlet gown</l>
       <l n="50">Harangued , and welcomed him to town .</l>
       <l n="51">But Death had business to dispatch ;</l>
       <l n="52">His mind was running on his match .</l>
       <l n="53">And hearing much of Daphne 's fame ,</l>
       <l n="54">His majesty of terrors came ,</l>
       <l n="55">Fine as a colonel of the guards ,</l>
       <l n="56">To visit where she sat at cards ;</l>
       <l n="57">She , as he came into the room ,</l>
       <l n="58">Thought him Adonis in his bloom .</l>
       <l n="59">And now her heart with pleasure jumps ,</l>
       <l n="60">She scarce remembers what is trumps ;</l>
       <l n="61">For such a shape of skin and bone</l>
       <l n="62">Was never seen except her own .</l>
       <l n="63">Charm 'd with his eyes , and chin , and snout ,</l>
       <l n="64">Her pocket-glass drew slily out ;</l>
       <l n="65">And grew enamour 'd with her phiz ,</l>
       <l n="66">As just the counterpart of his .</l>
       <l n="67">She darted many a private glance ,</l>
       <l n="68">And freely made the first advance ;</l>
       <l n="69">Was of her beauty grown so vain ,</l>
       <l n="70">She doubted not to win the swain ;</l>
       <l n="71">Nothing she thought could sooner gain him ,</l>
       <l n="72">Than with her wit to entertain him .</l>
       <l n="73">She ask 'd about her friends below ;</l>
       <l n="74">This meagre fop , that batter 'd beau ;</l>
       <l n="75">Whether some late departed toasts</l>
       <l n="76">Had got gallants among the ghosts ?</l>
       <l n="77">If Chloe were a sharper still</l>
       <l n="78">As great as ever at quadrille ?</l>
       <l n="79">( The ladies there must needs be rooks ,</l>
       <l n="80">For cards , we know , are Pluto 's books . )</l>
       <l n="81">If Florimel had found her love ,</l>
       <l n="82">For whom she hang 'd herself above ?</l>
       <l n="83">How oft a-week was kept a ball</l>
       <l n="84">By Proserpine at Pluto 's hall ?</l>
       <l n="85">She fancied those Elysian shades</l>
       <l n="86">The sweetest place for masquerades ;</l>
       <l n="87">How pleasant on the banks of Styx ,</l>
       <l n="88">To troll it in a coach and six !</l>
       <l n="89">What pride a female heart inflames ?</l>
       <l n="90">How endless are ambition 's aims :</l>
       <l n="91">Cease , haughty nymph ; the Fates decree</l>
       <l n="92">Death must not be a spouse for thee ;</l>
       <l n="93">For , when by chance the meagre shade</l>
       <l n="94">Upon thy hand his finger laid ,</l>
       <l n="95">Thy hand as dry and cold as lead ,</l>
       <l n="96">His matrimonial spirit fled ;</l>
       <l n="97">He felt about his heart a damp ,</l>
       <l n="98">That quite extinguished Cupid 's lamp :</l>
       <l n="99">Away the frighted spectre scuds ,</l>
       <l n="100">And leaves my lady in the suds .</l>

      <head>DAPHNE</head>
       <l n="1">Daphne knows , with equal ease ,</l>
       <l n="2">How to vex , and how to please ;</l>
       <l n="3">But the folly of her sex</l>
       <l n="4">Makes her sole delight to vex .</l>
       <l n="5">Never woman more devised</l>
       <l n="6">Surer ways to be despised ;</l>
       <l n="7">Paradoxes weakly wielding ,</l>
       <l n="8">Always conquer 'd , never yielding .</l>
       <l n="9">To dispute , her chief delight ,</l>
       <l n="10">Without one opinion right :</l>
       <l n="11">Thick her arguments she lays on ,</l>
       <l n="12">And with cavils combats reason ;</l>
       <l n="13">Answers in decisive way ,</l>
       <l n="14">Never hears what you can say ;</l>
       <l n="15">Still her odd perverseness shows</l>
       <l n="16">Chiefly where she nothing knows ;</l>
       <l n="17">And , where she is most familiar ,</l>
       <l n="18">Always peevisher and sillier ;</l>
       <l n="19">All her spirits in a flame</l>
       <l n="20">When she knows she 's most to blame .</l>
       <l n="21">Send me hence ten thousand miles ,</l>
       <l n="22">From a face that always smiles :</l>
       <l n="23">None could ever act that part ,</l>
       <l n="24">But a fury in her heart .</l>
       <l n="25">Ye who hate such inconsistence ,</l>
       <l n="26">To be easy , keep your distance :</l>
       <l n="27">Or in folly still befriend her ,</l>
       <l n="28">But have no concern to mend her ;</l>
       <l n="29">Lose not time to contradict her ,</l>
       <l n="30">Nor endeavour to convict her .</l>
       <l n="31">Never take it in your thought ,</l>

       <l n="33">Into contradiction warm her ,</l>
       <l n="34">Then , perhaps , you may reform her :</l>
       <l n="35">Only take this rule along ,</l>
       <l n="36">Always to advise her wrong ;</l>
       <l n="37">And reprove her when she 's right ;</l>
       <l n="38">She may then grow wise for spight .</l>
       <l n="39">No — that scheme will ne'er succeed ,</l>
       <l n="40">She has better learnt her creed ;</l>
       <l n="41">She 's too cunning and too skilful ,</l>
       <l n="42">When to yield , and when be wilful .</l>
       <l n="43">Nature holds her forth two mirrors ,</l>
       <l n="44">One for truth , and one for errors :</l>
       <l n="45">That looks hideous , fierce , and frightful ;</l>
       <l n="46">This is flattering and delightful :</l>
       <l n="47">That she throws away as foul ;</l>
       <l n="48">Sits by this to dress her soul .</l>

      <docTitle><titlePart>RIDDLES BY DR . SWIFT AND HIS FRIENDS . WRITTEN IN OR ABOUT THE YEAR 1724</titlePart></docTitle>
      <docImprint>The following notice is subjoined to some of these riddles , in the<settlement>Dublin</settlement>edition : “ About nine or ten years ago , ( i. e . about<date>1724</date>,) some ingenious gentlemen , friends to the author , used to entertain themselves with writing riddles , and send them to him and their other acquaintance ; copies of which ran about , and some of them were printed , both here and in<country>England</country>. The author , at his leisure hours , fell into the same amusement ; although it be said that he thought them of no great merit , entertainment , or use . However , by the advice of some persons , for whom the author hath a great esteem , and who were pleased to send us the copies , we have ventured to print the few following , as we have done two or three before , and which are allowed to be genuine ; because we are informed that several good judges have a taste for such kind of compositions . ”</docImprint>

       <l n="81">Proteus on you bestow 'd the boon</l>

       <l n="85">How famed thy conduct in the fight</l>
       <l n="86">With Hermes , son of Pleias bright !</l>
       <l n="87">Outnumber 'd , half encompass 'd round ,</l>
       <l n="88">You strove for every inch of ground ;</l>
       <l n="89">Then , by a soldierly retreat ,</l>
       <l n="90">Retired to your imperial seat .</l>
       <l n="91">The victor , when your steps he traced ,</l>
       <l n="92">Found all the realms before him waste :</l>
       <l n="93">You , o'er the high triumphal arch</l>
       <l n="94">Pontific , made your glorious march :</l>
       <l n="95">The wondrous arch behind you fell ,</l>
       <l n="96">And left a chasm profound as hell :</l>
       <l n="97">You , in your capitol secured ,</l>
       <l n="98">A siege as long as Troy endured .</l>

       <l n="1">In youth exalted high in air ,</l>
       <l n="2">Or bathing in the waters fair ,</l>
       <l n="3">Nature to form me took delight ,</l>
       <l n="4">And clad my body all in white .</l>
       <l n="5">My person tall , and slender waist ,</l>
       <l n="6">On either side with fringes graced ;</l>
       <l n="7">Till me that tyrant man espied ,</l>

       <l n="10">The tyrant stript me to the skin :</l>
       <l n="11">My skin he flay 'd , my hair he cropt :</l>
       <l n="12">At head and foot my body lopt :</l>
       <l n="13">And then , with heart more hard than stone ,</l>
       <l n="14">He pick 'd my marrow from the bone .</l>
       <l n="15">To vex me more , he took a freak</l>
       <l n="16">To slit my tongue and make me speak :</l>

       <l n="18">I speak to eyes , and not to ears .</l>
       <l n="19">He oft employs me in disguise ,</l>
       <l n="20">And makes me tell a thousand lies :</l>
       <l n="21">To me he chiefly gives in trust</l>
       <l n="22">To please his malice or his lust .</l>
       <l n="23">From me no secret he can hide ;</l>
       <l n="24">I see his vanity and pride :</l>
       <l n="25">And my delight is to expose</l>
       <l n="26">His follies to his greatest foes .</l>
       <l n="27">All languages I can command ,</l>
       <l n="28">Yet not a word I understand .</l>
       <l n="29">Without my aid , the best divine</l>
       <l n="30">In learning would not know a line :</l>
       <l n="31">The lawyer must forget his pleading ;</l>

       <l n="33">Nay ; man my master is my slave ;</l>
       <l n="34">I give command to kill or save ,</l>
       <l n="35">Can grant ten thousand pounds a-year ,</l>

       <l n="37">But , while I thus my life relate ,</l>
       <l n="38">I only hasten on my fate .</l>

       <l n="89">Yet , from this mingled mass of things ,</l>
       <l n="90">In time a new creation springs .</l>

       <l n="94">Of vegetables , brutes , and men .</l>
       <l n="95">So Jove pronounced among the gods ,</l>
       <l n="96">Olympus trembling as he nods .</l>

       <l n="3">To Strephon I have still been true ,</l>
       <l n="4">And of as noble blood as you ;</l>

       <l n="26">For , should I die for love of you ,</l>
       <l n="27">I 'll haunt thy dreams , a bloodless ghost ;</l>

       <l n="36">Who scourged to death that scourge of Rome ,</l>

       <l n="4">Though many and various , and large and asunder ,</l>
       <l n="5">Without jostling or crowding they pass side by side ,</l>
       <l n="6">Through a wonderful wicket , not half an inch wide ;</l>

      <head>THE PREFACE TO THE ENGLISH EDITION</head>
      <head>The author of the following poem is said to be Dr. J. S. D. S. P. D. who writ it , as well as several other copies of verses of the like kind , by way of amusement , in the family of an honourable gentleman in the north of Ireland , where he spent a summer , about two or three years ago .<span corresp="#note2_18" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>A certain very great person ,<span corresp="#note3_12" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>then in that kingdom , having heard much of this poem , obtained a copy from the gentleman , or , as some say , the lady in whose house it was written , from whence I know not by what accident several other copies were transcribed full of errors . As I have a great respect for the supposed author , I have procured a true copy of the poem , the publication whereof can do him less injury than printing any of those incorrect ones which run about in manuscript , and would infallibly be soon in the press , if not thus prevented . Some expressions being peculiar to Ireland , I have prevailed on a gentleman of that kingdom to explain them , and I have put the several explanations in their proper places .— First Edition .</head>
       <l n="1">Thus spoke to my lady the knight<span corresp="#note2_19" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>full of care ,</l>
       <l n="2">“ Let me have your advice in a weighty affair .</l>
       <l n="3">This Hamilton 's bawn , while it sticks in my hand</l>
       <l n="4">I lose by the house what I get by the land ;</l>
       <l n="5">But how to dispose of it to the best bidder ,</l>
       <l n="6">For a barrack<span corresp="#note6_5" type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>or malt-house , we now must consider .</l>
       <l n="7">“ First , let me suppose I make it a malt-house ,</l>
       <l n="8">Here I have computed the profit will fall t'us :</l>
       <l n="9">There 's nine hundred pounds for labour and grain ,</l>
       <l n="10">I increase it to twelve , so three hundred remain ;</l>
       <l n="11">A handsome addition for wine and good cheer ,</l>
       <l n="12">Three dishes a-day , and three hogsheads a-year ;</l>
       <l n="13">With a dozen large vessels my vault shall be stored ;</l>
       <l n="14">No little scrub joint shall come on my board ;</l>
       <l n="15">And you and the Dean no more shall combine</l>
       <l n="16">To stint me at night to one bottle of wine ;</l>
       <l n="17">Nor shall I , for his humour , permit you to purloin</l>
       <l n="18">A stone and a quarter of beef from my sir-loin .</l>
       <l n="19">If I make it a barrack , the crown is my tenant ;</l>
       <l n="20">My dear , I have ponder 'd again and again o n't :</l>
       <l n="21">In poundage and drawbacks I lose half my rent ,</l>
       <l n="22">Whatever they give me , I must be content ,</l>
       <l n="23">Or join with the court in every debate ;</l>
       <l n="24">And rather than that , I would lose my estate . ”</l>
       <l n="25">Thus ended the knight ; thus began his meek wife :</l>
       <l n="26">“ It must , and it shall be a barrack , my life .</l>
       <l n="27">I 'm grown a mere mopus ; no company comes</l>
       <l n="28">But a rabble of tenants , and rusty dull rums .<span corresp="#note5_6" type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span></l>
       <l n="29">With parsons what lady can keep herself clean ?</l>
       <l n="30">I 'm all over daub 'd when I sit by the Dean .</l>
       <l n="31">But if you will give us a barrack , my dear ,</l>
       <l n="32">The captain I 'm sure will always come here ;</l>
       <l n="33">I then shall not value his deanship a straw ,</l>
       <l n="34">For the captain , I warrant , will keep him in awe ;</l>
       <l n="35">Or , should he pretend to be brisk and alert ,</l>
       <l n="36">Will tell him that chaplains should not be so pert ;</l>
       <l n="37">That men of his coat should be minding their prayers ,</l>
       <l n="38">And not among ladies to give themselves airs . ”</l>
       <l n="39">Thus argued my lady , but argued in vain ;</l>
       <l n="40">The knight his opinion resolved to maintain .</l>
       <l n="41">But Hannah ,<span corresp="#note6_6" type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>who listen 'd to all that was past ,</l>
       <l n="42">And could not endure so vulgar a taste ,</l>
       <l n="43">As soon as her ladyship call 'd to be dress 'd ,</l>
       <l n="44">Cried , “ Madam , why surely my master 's possess 'd ,</l>
       <l n="45">Sir Arthur the maltster ! how fine it will sound !</l>
       <l n="46">I 'd rather the bawn were sunk under ground .</l>
       <l n="47">But , madam , I guess 'd there would never come good ,</l>
       <l n="48">When I saw him so often with Darby and Wood .<span corresp="#note7_4" type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span></l>
       <l n="49">And now my dream 's out ; for I was a-dream 'd</l>
       <l n="50">That I saw a huge rat — O dear , how I scream 'd !</l>
       <l n="51">And after , methought , I had lost my new shoes ;</l>
       <l n="52">And Molly , she said , I should hear some ill news .</l>
       <l n="53">“ Dear Madam , had you but the spirit to tease ,</l>
       <l n="54">You might have a barrack whenever you please :</l>
       <l n="55">And , madam , I always believed you so stout ,</l>
       <l n="56">That for twenty denials you would not give out .</l>
       <l n="57">If I had a husband like him , I purtest ,</l>
       <l n="58">Till he gave me my will , I would give him no rest ;</l>
       <l n="59">And , rather than come in the same pair of sheets</l>
       <l n="60">With such a cross man , I would lie in the streets :</l>
       <l n="61">But , madam , I beg you , contrive and invent ,</l>
       <l n="62">And worry him out , till he gives his consent .</l>
       <l n="63">Dear madam , whene'er of a barrack I think ,</l>
       <l n="64">An I were to be hang 'd , I can n't sleep a wink :</l>
       <l n="65">For if a new crotchet comes into my brain ,</l>
       <l n="66">I can n't get it out , though I 'd never so fain .</l>
       <l n="67">I fancy already a barrack contrived</l>
       <l n="68">At Hamilton 's bawn , and the troop is arrived ;</l>
       <l n="69">Of this to be sure , Sir Arthur has warning ,</l>
       <l n="70">And waits on the captain betimes the next morning .</l>
       <l n="71">“ Now see , when they meet , how their honours behave ;</l>
       <l n="72">‘ Noble captain , your servant ’ — ‘ Sir Arthur , your slave ;</l>
       <l n="73">You honour me much ’ — ‘ The honour is mine . ’ —</l>
       <l n="74">‘'Twas a sad rainy night ’ — ‘ But the morning is fine . ’ —</l>
       <l n="75">‘ Pray , how does my lady ? ’ — ‘ My wife 's at your service . ’ —</l>
       <l n="76">‘ I think I have seen her picture by Jervas . ’ —</l>
       <l n="77">‘ Good-morrow , good captain ’ — ‘ I 'll wait on you down ’ —</l>
       <l n="78">‘ You sha n't stir a foot ’ — ‘ You 'll think me a clown . ’ —</l>
       <l n="79">‘ For all the world , captain , not half an inch farther ’ —</l>
       <l n="80">‘ You must be obey 'd — Your servant , Sir Arthur !</l>
       <l n="81">My humble respects to my lady unknown . ’ —</l>
       <l n="82">‘ I hope you will use my house as your own . ’ ”</l>
       <l n="83">“ Go bring me my smock , and leave off your prate ,</l>
       <l n="84">Thou hast certainly gotten a cup in thy pate . ”</l>
       <l n="85">“ Pray , madam , be quiet : what was it I said ?</l>
       <l n="86">You had like to have put it quite out of my head .</l>
       <l n="87">Next day to be sure , the captain will come ,</l>
       <l n="88">At the head of his troop , with trumpet and drum .</l>
       <l n="89">Now , madam , observe how he marches in state :</l>
       <l n="90">The man with the kettle-drum enters the gate :</l>
       <l n="91">Dub , dub , adub , dub . The trumpeters follow .</l>
       <l n="92">Tantara , tantara ; while all the boys holla .</l>
       <l n="93">See now comes the captain all daub 'd with gold lace :</l>
       <l n="94">O la ! the sweet gentleman ! look in his face ;</l>
       <l n="95">And see how he rides like a lord of the land ,</l>
       <l n="96">With the fine flaming sword that he holds in his hand ;</l>
       <l n="97">And his horse , the dear creter , it prances and rears ;</l>
       <l n="98">With ribbons in knots at its tail and its ears :</l>
       <l n="99">At last comes the troop , by word of command ,</l>
       <l n="100">Drawn up in our court ; when the captain cries , STAND !</l>
       <l n="101">Your ladyship lifts up the sash to be seen ,</l>
       <l n="102">For sure I had dizen 'd you out like a queen .</l>
       <l n="103">The captain , to show he is proud of the favour ,</l>
       <l n="104">Looks up to your window , and cocks up his beaver ;</l>
       <l n="105">( His beaver is cock 'd : pray , madam , mark that ,</l>
       <l n="106">For a captain of horse never takes off his hat ,</l>
       <l n="107">Because he has never a hand that is idle ,</l>
       <l n="108">For the right holds the sword , and the left holds the bridle ;)</l>
       <l n="109">Then flourishes thrice his sword in the air ,</l>
       <l n="110">As a compliment due to a lady so fair ;</l>
       <l n="111">( How I tremble to think of the blood it has spilt ! )</l>
       <l n="112">Then he lowers down the point , and kisses the hilt .</l>
       <l n="113">Your ladyship smiles , and thus you begin :</l>
       <l n="114">‘ Pray , captain , be pleased to alight and walk in . ’</l>
       <l n="115">The captain salutes you with congee profound ,</l>
       <l n="116">And your ladyship curtseys half way to the ground .</l>
       <l n="117">‘ Kit , run to your master , and bid him come to us ;</l>
       <l n="118">I 'm sure he 'll be proud of the honour you do us ;</l>
       <l n="119">And , captain , you 'll do us the favour to stay ,</l>
       <l n="120">And take a short dinner here with us to-day :</l>
       <l n="121">You 're heartily welcome ; but as for good cheer ,</l>
       <l n="122">You come in the very worst time of the year ;</l>
       <l n="123">If I had expected so worthy a guest — ’</l>
       <l n="124">‘ Lord , madam ! your ladyship sure is in jest ;</l>
       <l n="125">You banter me , madam ; the kingdom must grant — ’</l>
       <l n="126">‘ You officers , captain , are so complaisant ! ’ ” —</l>
       <l n="127">“ Hist , hussey , I think I hear somebody coming “ —</l>
       <l n="128">“ No madam : ‘ tis only Sir Arthur a-humming .</l>
       <l n="129">To shorten my tale , ( for I hate a long story ,)</l>
       <l n="130">The captain at dinner appears in his glory ;</l>
       <l n="131">The dean and the doctor<span corresp="#note8_3" type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>have humbled their pride ,</l>
       <l n="132">For the captain 's entreated to sit by your side ;</l>
       <l n="133">And , because he 's their betters , you carve for him first ;</l>
       <l n="134">The parsons for envy are ready to burst .</l>
       <l n="135">The servants , amazed , are scarce ever able</l>
       <l n="136">To keep off their eyes , as they wait at the table ;</l>
       <l n="137">And Molly and I have thrust in our nose ,</l>
       <l n="138">To peep at the captain in all his fine clo'es .</l>
       <l n="139">Dear madam , be sure he 's a fine spoken man ,</l>
       <l n="140">Do but hear on the clergy how glib his tongue ran ;</l>
       <l n="141">And , ‘ madam , ’ says he , ‘ if such dinners you give ,</l>
       <l n="142">You 'll ne'er want for parsons as long as you live .</l>
       <l n="143">I ne'er knew a parson without a good nose ;</l>

       <l n="182">Then , turning to Hannah , and forcing a frown ,</l>
       <l n="183">Although it was plain in her heart she was glad ,</l>
       <l n="184">Cried , “ Hussey , why sure the wench is gone mad !</l>

      <head>THE DEAN 'S REASONS</head>
      <head>FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL</head>
       <l n="1">I will not build on yonder mount ;</l>
       <l n="2">And , should you call me to account ,</l>
       <l n="3">Consulting with myself , I find</l>
       <l n="4">It was no levity of mind .</l>
       <l n="5">Whate'er I promised or intended ,</l>
       <l n="6">No fault of mine , the scheme is ended ;</l>
       <l n="7">Nor can you tax me as unsteady ,</l>
       <l n="8">I have a hundred causes ready ;</l>
       <l n="9">All risen since that flattering time ,</l>
       <l n="10">When Drapier'shYpppHeNHill appear 'd in rhyme .</l>
       <l n="11">I am , as now too late I find ,</l>
       <l n="12">The greatest cully of mankind ;</l>
       <l n="13">The lowest boy in Martin 's school</l>
       <l n="14">May turn and wind me like a fool .</l>
       <l n="15">How could I form so wild a vision ,</l>
       <l n="16">To seek , in deserts , Fields Elysian ?</l>
       <l n="17">To live in fear , suspicion , variance ,</l>
       <l n="18">With thieves , fanatics , and barbarians ?</l>
       <l n="19">But here my lady will object ;</l>
       <l n="20">Your deanship ought to recollect ,</l>
       <l n="21">That , near the knight of Gosford<span corresp="#note1_26" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>placed ,</l>
       <l n="22">Whom you allow a man of taste ,</l>
       <l n="23">Your intervals of time to spend</l>
       <l n="24">With so conversable a friend ,</l>
       <l n="25">It would not signify a pin</l>
       <l n="26">Whatever climate you were in .</l>
       <l n="27">‘ Tis true , but what advantage comes</l>
       <l n="28">To me from all a usurer 's plums ;</l>
       <l n="29">Though I should see him twice a-day ,</l>
       <l n="30">And am his neighbour ‘ cross the way :</l>
       <l n="31">If all my rhetoric must fail</l>
       <l n="32">To strike him for a pot of ale ?</l>
       <l n="33">Thus , when the learned and the wise</l>
       <l n="34">Conceal their talents from our eyes ,</l>
       <l n="35">And from deserving friends withhold</l>
       <l n="36">Their gifts , as misers do their gold ;</l>
       <l n="37">Their knowledge to themselves confined</l>
       <l n="38">Is the same avarice of mind ;</l>
       <l n="39">Nor makes their conversation better ,</l>
       <l n="40">Than if they never knew a letter .</l>
       <l n="41">Such is the fate of Gosford 's knight ,</l>
       <l n="42">Who keeps his wisdom out of sight ;</l>
       <l n="43">Whose uncommunicative heart</l>
       <l n="44">Will scarce one precious word impart :</l>
       <l n="45">Still rapt in speculations deep ,</l>
       <l n="46">His outward senses fast asleep ;</l>
       <l n="47">Who , while I talk , a song will hum ,</l>
       <l n="48">Or with his fingers beat the drum ;</l>
       <l n="49">Beyond the skies transports his mind ,</l>
       <l n="50">And leaves a lifeless corpse behind .</l>
       <l n="51">But , as for me , who ne'er could clamber high ,</l>
       <l n="52">To understand Malebranche or Cambray ;</l>
       <l n="53">Who send my mind ( as I believe ) less</l>
       <l n="54">Than others do , on errands sleeveless ;</l>
       <l n="55">Can listen to a tale humdrum ,</l>
       <l n="56">And with attention read Tom Thumb ;</l>
       <l n="57">My spirits with my body progging ,</l>
       <l n="58">Both hand in hand together jogging ;</l>
       <l n="59">Sunk over head and ears in matter .</l>
       <l n="60">Nor can of metaphysics smatter ;</l>
       <l n="61">Am more diverted with a quibble</l>
       <l n="62">Than dream of words intelligible ;</l>
       <l n="63">And think all notions too abstracted</l>
       <l n="64">Are like the ravings of a crackt head ;</l>
       <l n="65">What intercourse of minds can be</l>
       <l n="66">Betwixt the knight sublime and me ,</l>
       <l n="67">If when I talk , as talk I must ,</l>
       <l n="68">It is but prating to a bust ?</l>
       <l n="69">Where friendship is by Fate design 'd ,</l>
       <l n="70">It forms a union in the mind :</l>
       <l n="71">But here I differ from the knight</l>
       <l n="72">In every point , like black and white :</l>
       <l n="73">For none can say that ever yet</l>
       <l n="74">We both in one opinion met :</l>
       <l n="75">Not in philosophy , or ale ;</l>
       <l n="76">In state affairs , or planting kale ;</l>
       <l n="77">In rhetoric , or picking straws ;</l>
       <l n="78">In roasting larks , or making laws ;</l>
       <l n="79">In public schemes , or catching flies ;</l>
       <l n="80">In parliaments , or pudding pies .</l>
       <l n="81">The neighbours wonder why the knight</l>
       <l n="82">Should in a country life delight ,</l>
       <l n="83">Who not one pleasure entertains</l>
       <l n="84">To cheer the solitary scenes :</l>
       <l n="85">His guests are few , his visits rare ;</l>
       <l n="86">Nor uses time , nor time will spare ;</l>
       <l n="87">Nor rides , nor walks , nor hunts , nor fowls ,</l>
       <l n="88">Nor plays at cards , or dice , or bowls ;</l>
       <l n="89">But seated in an easy-chair ,</l>
       <l n="90">Despises exercise and air .</l>
       <l n="91">His rural walks he ne'er adorns ;</l>
       <l n="92">Here poor Pomona sits on thorns :</l>
       <l n="93">And there neglected Flora settles</l>
       <l n="94">Her bum upon a bed of nettles .</l>
       <l n="95">Those thankless and officious cares</l>
       <l n="96">I used to take in friends ’ affairs ,</l>
       <l n="97">From which I never could refrain ,</l>
       <l n="98">And have been often chid in vain ;</l>
       <l n="99">From these I am recover 'd quite ,</l>
       <l n="100">At least in what regards the knight .</l>
       <l n="101">Preserve his health , his store increase ;</l>
       <l n="102">May nothing interrupt his peace !</l>
       <l n="103">But now let all his tenants round</l>
       <l n="104">First milk his cows , and after , pound ;</l>
       <l n="105">Let every cottager conspire</l>
       <l n="106">To cut his hedges down for fire ;</l>
       <l n="107">The naughty boys about the village</l>
       <l n="108">His crabs and sloes may freely pillage ;</l>
       <l n="109">He still may keep a pack of knaves</l>
       <l n="110">To spoil his work , and work by halves ;</l>
       <l n="111">His meadows may be dug by swine ,</l>
       <l n="112">It shall be no concern of mine ;</l>
       <l n="113">For why should I continue still</l>
       <l n="114">To serve a friend against his will ?</l>

       <l n="179">Providing butter for the cook !</l>
       <l n="180">Three morning hours you toss and shake</l>
       <l n="181">The bottle till your fingers ache ;</l>
       <l n="182">Hard is the toil , nor small the art ,</l>
       <l n="183">The butter from the whey to part :</l>
       <l n="184">Behold a frothy substance rise ;</l>
       <l n="185">Be cautious or your bottle flies .</l>
       <l n="186">The butter comes , our fears are ceased ;</l>
       <l n="187">And out you squeeze an ounce at least .</l>
       <l n="188">Your reverence thus , with like success ,</l>
       <l n="189">( Nor is your skill or labour less ,)</l>
       <l n="190">When bent upon some smart lampoon ,</l>
       <l n="191">Will toss and turn your brain till noon ;</l>
       <l n="192">Which in its jumblings round the skull ,</l>

       <l n="194">While nothing comes but froth at first ,</l>
       <l n="195">You think your giddy head will burst ;</l>
       <l n="196">But squeezing out four lines in rhyme ,</l>
       <l n="197">Are largely paid for all your time .</l>
       <l n="198">But you have raised your generous mind</l>
       <l n="199">To works of more exalted kind .</l>
       <l n="200">Palladio was not half so skill 'd in</l>
       <l n="201">The grandeur or the art of building .</l>
       <l n="202">Two temples of magnific size</l>

       <l n="204">That might be envied by the Greeks ;</l>

       <l n="209">Here pay their vows on bended knees :</l>
       <l n="210">For ‘ tis profane when sexes mingle ,</l>
       <l n="211">And every nymph must enter single ;</l>
       <l n="212">And when she feels an inward motion ,</l>
       <l n="213">Come fill 'd with reverence and devotion .</l>
       <l n="214">The bashful maid , to hide her blush ,</l>

       <l n="216">Here unobserved she boldly goes ,</l>
       <l n="217">As who should say , to pluck a rose ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 16 ]</span></l>

       <l n="226">Yet , when your lofty domes I praise</l>
       <l n="227">I sigh to think of ancient days .</l>

       <l n="232">Forbid in open air to breathe ,</l>
       <l n="233">Why are thine altars fix 'd beneath ?</l>
       <l n="234">When Saturn ruled the skies alone ,</l>

       <l n="236">This earthly globe , to thee assign 'd ,</l>
       <l n="237">Received the gifts of all mankind .</l>
       <l n="238">Ten thousand altars smoking round ,</l>
       <l n="239">Were built to thee with offerings crown 'd ;</l>

       <l n="242">The margin of a purling stream</l>
       <l n="243">Sent up to thee a grateful steam ;</l>
       <l n="244">Though sometimes thou wert pleased to wink ,</l>
       <l n="245">If Naiads swept them from the brink :</l>

       <l n="254">But when at last usurping Jove</l>
       <l n="255">Old Saturn from his empire drove ,</l>

       <l n="263">Taught harmless man to cram and stuff .</l>
       <l n="264">She sent her priests in wooden shoes</l>
       <l n="265">From haughty Gaul to make ragouts ;</l>
       <l n="266">Instead of wholesome bread and cheese ,</l>
       <l n="267">To dress their soups and fricassees ;</l>

       <l n="270">This bloated harpy , sprung from hell ,</l>
       <l n="271">Confined thee , goddess , to a cell :</l>
       <l n="272">Sprung from her womb that impious line ,</l>
       <l n="273">Contemners of thy rites divine .</l>
       <l n="274">First , lolling Sloth , in woollen cap ,</l>

       <l n="283">To thee no verdant altars rear ;</l>

       <l n="287">Offensive to thy nicer nose .</l>
       <l n="288">Ah ! who , in our degenerate days ,</l>
       <l n="289">As nature prompts , his offering pays ?</l>
       <l n="290">Here nature never difference made</l>
       <l n="291">Between the sceptre and the spade .</l>
       <l n="292">Ye great ones , why will ye disdain</l>
       <l n="293">To pay your tribute on the plain ?</l>
       <l n="294">Why will you place in lazy pride</l>
       <l n="295">Your altars near your couches ’ side :</l>
       <l n="296">When from the homeliest earthen ware</l>
       <l n="297">Are sent up offerings more sincere ,</l>
       <l n="298">Than where the haughty duchess locks</l>
       <l n="299">Her silver vase in cedar box ?</l>

      <head>ON THE RECORDER OF BLESSINGTON 'S ADDRESS TO QUEEN ANNE</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Mr. William Crowe , Recorder of Blessington 's Address to her Majesty , as</l>
       <l n="2">copied from the London Gazette .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">To the Queen 's most Excellent Majesty ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="4">The humble Address of the Sovereign , Recorder , Burgesses , and Freemen , of</l>
       <l n="5">the Borough of Blessington .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>May it please your Majesty , Though we stand almost last on the roll of boroughs of this your majesty 's kingdom of Ireland , and therefore , in good manners to our elder brothers , press but late among the joyful crowd about your royal throne : yet we beg leave to assure your majesty , that we come behind none in our good affection to your sacred person and government ; insomuch , that the late surprising accounts from Germany have filled us with a joy not inferior to any of our fellow-subjects .</p>
     <p>We heard with transport that the English warmed the field to that degree , that thirty squadrons , part of the vanquished enemy , were forced to fly to water , not able to stand their fire , and drank their last draught in the Danube , for the waste they had before committed on its injured banks , thereby putting an end to their master 's long-boasted victories : a glorious push indeed , and worthy a general of the Queen of England . And we are not a little pleased , to find several gentlemen in considerable posts of your majesty 's army , who drew their first breath in this country , sharing in the good fortune of those who so effectually put in execution the command of your gallant , enterprizing general , whose twin-battles have , with his own title of Marlborough , given immortality to the otherwise perishing names of Schellenberg and Hogstete : actions that speak him born under stars as propitious to England as that he now wears , on both which he has so often reflected lustre , as to have now abundantly repaid the glory they once lent him . Nor can we but congratulate with a joy proportioned to the success of your majesty 's fleet , our last campaign at sea , since by it we observe the French obliged to steer their wonted course for security , to their ports ; and Gibraltar , the Spaniards ’ ancient defence , bravely stormed , possessed , and maintained by your majesty 's subjects .</p>
     <p>May the supplies for reducing the exorbitant power of France be such , as may soon turn your wreaths of laurel into branches of olive : that , after the toils of a just and honourable war , carried on by a confederacy of which your majesty is most truly , as of the faith , styled Defender , we may live to enjoy , under your majesty 's auspicious government , the blessings of a profound and lasting peace ; a peace beyond the power of him to violate , who , but for his own unreasonable conveniency , destructive always of his neighbours , never yet kept any . And , to complete our happiness , may your majesty again prove to your own family , what you have been so eminently to the true church , a nursing mother . So wish , and so pray , may it please your majesty , your majesty 's most dutiful and loyal subjects , and devoted humble servants .</p>
     <p>This Address was presented January 17 , 1704-5 .</p>

       <l n="1">The rod was but a harmless wand ,</l>
       <l n="2">While Moses held it in his hand ;</l>
       <l n="3">But , soon as e'er he laid it down ,</l>
       <l n="4">Twas a devouring serpent grown .</l>
       <l n="5">Our great magician , Hamet Sid ,</l>
       <l n="6">Reverses what the prophet did :</l>
       <l n="7">His rod was honest English wood ,</l>

       <l n="9">Till metamorphos 'd by his grasp ,</l>
       <l n="10">It grew an all-devouring asp ;</l>

       <l n="26">Scorning to show the least respect :</l>
       <l n="27">As ready was the wand of Sid</l>
       <l n="28">To bend where golden mines were hid :</l>
       <l n="29">In Scottish hills found precious ore ,<span corresp="#note4_11" type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span></l>
       <l n="30">Where none e'er look 'd for it before ;</l>
       <l n="31">And by a gentle bow divine</l>

       <l n="34">Stood without motion like a stake .</l>
       <l n="35">The rod of Hermes<span corresp="#note5_11" type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>was renown 'd</l>
       <l n="36">For charms above and under ground ;</l>
       <l n="37">To sleep could mortal eyelids fix ,</l>
       <l n="38">And drive departed souls to Styx .</l>
       <l n="39">That rod was a just type of Sid 's ,</l>
       <l n="40">Which o'er a British senate 's lids</l>
       <l n="41">Could scatter opium full as well ,</l>
       <l n="42">And drive as many souls to hell .</l>
       <l n="43">Sid 's rod was slender , white , and tall ,</l>
       <l n="44">Which oft he used to fish withal ;</l>
       <l n="45">A PLACE was fasten 'd to the hook ,</l>
       <l n="46">And many score of gudgeons took ;</l>
       <l n="47">Yet still so happy was his fate ,</l>
       <l n="48">He caught his fish and sav 'd his bait .</l>
       <l n="49">Sid 's brethren of the conj'ring tribe ,</l>

       <l n="52">To keep mischievous spirits out .</l>
       <l n="53">Sid 's rod was of a larger stride ,</l>
       <l n="54">And made a circle thrice as wide ,</l>
       <l n="55">Where spirits throng 'd with hideous din ,</l>
       <l n="56">And he stood there to take them in ;</l>
       <l n="57">But when th'enchanted rod was broke ,</l>
       <l n="58">They vanish 'd in a stinking smoke .</l>
       <l n="59">Achilles ’ sceptre was of wood ,</l>
       <l n="60">Like Sid 's , but nothing near so good ;</l>
       <l n="61">Though down from ancestors divine</l>
       <l n="62">Transmitted to the heroes line ;</l>
       <l n="63">Thence , thro ’ a long descent of kings ,</l>

       <l n="65">Though this description looks so big ,</l>
       <l n="66">That sceptre was a sapless twig ,</l>

       <l n="73">And he , the dragon never sleeping ,</l>
       <l n="74">Guarded each fair Hesperian Pippin .</l>

       <l n="77">If his measures ye took ,</l>
       <l n="78">Thus for head and for rump</l>
       <l n="79">Together to jump ;</l>

       <l n="86">Know , I myself I</l>
       <l n="87">Was present and by ,</l>
       <l n="88">At the great trial , where there was a great company ,</l>
       <l n="89">Of a turbulent preacher , who , cursedly hot ,</l>
       <l n="90">Turn 'd the fifth of November , even the gun-powder plot ,</l>
       <l n="91">Into impudent railing , and the devil knows what :</l>
       <l n="92">Exclaiming like fury — it was at Paul 's , London —</l>
       <l n="93">How church was in danger , and like to be undone ,</l>
       <l n="94">And so gave the lie to gracious Queen Anne ;</l>
       <l n="95">And , which is far worse , to our parliament-men :</l>
       <l n="96">And then printed a book ,</l>
       <l n="97">Into which men did look :</l>
       <l n="98">True , he made a good text ;</l>
       <l n="99">But what follow 'd next</l>
       <l n="100">Was nought but a dunghill of sordid abuses ,</l>
       <l n="101">Instead of sound doctrine , with proofs to't , and uses .</l>
       <l n="102">It was high time of day</l>
       <l n="103">That such inflammation</l>
       <l n="104">should be extinguish 'd without more delay :</l>
       <l n="105">But there was no engine could possibly do't ,</l>
       <l n="106">Till the commons play 'd theirs , and so quite put it out .</l>
       <l n="107">So the man was tried for't ,</l>
       <l n="108">Before highest court :</l>
       <l n="109">Now it 's plain to be seen ,</l>
       <l n="110">It 's his principles I mean ,</l>
       <l n="111">Where they suffer 'd this noisy and his lawyers to bellow :</l>
       <l n="112">Which over , the blade</l>
       <l n="113">A poor punishment had</l>
       <l n="114">For that racket he made .</l>
       <l n="115">By which ye may know</l>
       <l n="116">They thought as I do ,</l>
       <l n="117">That he is but at best an inconsiderable fellow .</l>
       <l n="118">Upon this I find here ,</l>
       <l n="119">And everywhere ,</l>
       <l n="120">That the country rides rusty , and is all out of gear :</l>
       <l n="121">And for what ?</l>
       <l n="122">May I not</l>
       <l n="123">In opinion vary ,</l>
       <l n="124">And think the contrary ,</l>
       <l n="125">But it must create</l>
       <l n="126">Unfriendly debate ,</l>
       <l n="127">And disunion straight ;</l>
       <l n="128">When no reason in nature</l>
       <l n="129">Can be given of the matter ,</l>
       <l n="130">Any more than for shapes or for different stature ?</l>
       <l n="131">If you love your dear selves , your religion or queen ,</l>
       <l n="132">Ye ought in good manners to be peaceable men :</l>
       <l n="133">For nothing disgusts her</l>
       <l n="134">Like making a bluster :</l>
       <l n="135">And your making this riot ,</l>
       <l n="136">Is what she could cry at ,</l>
       <l n="137">Since all her concern 's for our welfare and quiet .</l>
       <l n="138">I would ask any man</l>
       <l n="139">Of them all that maintain</l>
       <l n="140">Their passive obedience</l>
       <l n="141">With such mighty vehemence ,</l>
       <l n="142">That damn 'd doctrine , I trow !</l>
       <l n="143">What he means by it , ho ’ ,</l>
       <l n="144">To trump it up now ?</l>
       <l n="145">Or to tell me in short ,</l>
       <l n="146">What need there is for't ?</l>
       <l n="147">Ye may say , I am hot ;</l>
       <l n="148">I say I am not ;</l>
       <l n="149">Only warm , as the subject on which I am got .</l>
       <l n="150">There are those alive yet ,</l>
       <l n="151">If they do not forget ,</l>
       <l n="152">May remember what mischiefs it did church and state :</l>
       <l n="153">Or at least must have heard</l>
       <l n="154">The deplorable calamities</l>
       <l n="155">It drew upon families ,</l>
       <l n="156">About sixty years ago and upward .</l>
       <l n="157">And now , do ye see ,</l>
       <l n="158">Whoever they be ,</l>
       <l n="159">That make such an oration</l>
       <l n="160">In our Protestant nation ,</l>
       <l n="161">As though church was all on a fire ,—</l>
       <l n="162">With whatever cloak</l>
       <l n="163">They may cover their talk ,</l>
       <l n="164">And wheedle the folk ,</l>
       <l n="165">That the oaths they have took ,</l>
       <l n="166">As our governors strictly require ;—</l>
       <l n="167">I say they are men — ( and I 'm a judge , ye all know ,)</l>
       <l n="168">That would our most excellent laws overthrow ;</l>
       <l n="169">For the greater part of them to church never go ;</l>
       <l n="170">Or , what 's much the same , it by very great chance is ,</l>
       <l n="171">If e'er they partake of her wise ordinances .</l>
       <l n="172">Their aim is , no doubt ,</l>
       <l n="173">Were they made to speak out ,</l>
       <l n="174">To pluck down the queen , that they make all this rout ;</l>
       <l n="175">And to set up , moreover ,</l>
       <l n="176">A bastardly brother ;</l>
       <l n="177">Or at least to prevent the House of Hanover .</l>
       <l n="178">Ye gentlemen of the jury ,</l>
       <l n="179">What means all this fury ,</l>
       <l n="180">Of which I 'm inform 'd by good hands , I assure ye ;</l>
       <l n="181">This insulting of persons by blows and rude speeches ,</l>
       <l n="182">And breaking of windows , which , you know , maketh breaches ?</l>
       <l n="183">Ye ought to resent it ,</l>
       <l n="184">And in duty present it ,</l>
       <l n="185">For the law is against it ;</l>
       <l n="186">Not only the actors engaged in this job ,</l>

     <p>PARODY ON THE RECORDER 'S SPEECH</p>
     <p>TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND , 4TH JULY , 1711</p>
     <p>This city can omit no opportunity of expressing their hearty affection for her majesty 's person and government ; and their regard for your grace , who has the honour of representing her in this kingdom .</p>
     <p>We retain , my lord , a grateful remembrance of the mild and just Administration of the government of this kingdom by your noble ancestors ; and , when we consider the share your grace had in the happy Revolution , in 1688 , and the many good laws you have procured us since , particularly that for preventing the farther growth of Popery , we are assured that that liberty and property , that happy constitution in church and state , to which we were restored by King William of glorious memory , will be inviolably preserved under your grace 's administration . And we are persuaded that we cannot more effectually recommend ourselves to your grace 's favour and protection , than by assuring you that we will , to the utmost of our power , contribute to the honour and safety of her majesty 's government , the maintenance of the succession in the illustrious house of Hanover , and that we shall at all times oppose the secret and open attempts of the Pretender , and all his abettors .</p>

     <p>THE WINDSOR PROPHECY<span corresp="#note1_39" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>“ About three months ago , at Windsor , a poor knight 's widow was buried in the cloisters . In digging the grave , the sexton struck against a small leaden coffer , about half a foot in length , and four inches wide . The poor man , expecting he had discovered a treasure , opened it with some difficulty ; but found only a small parchment , rolled up very fast , put into a leather case ; which case was tied at the top , and sealed with St. George , the impression on black wax , very rude and gothic . The parchment was carried to a gentleman of learning , who found in it the following lines , written in a black old English letter , and in the orthography of the age , which seems to be about two hundred years ago . I made a shift to obtain a copy of it ; but the transcriber , I find , hath in many parts altered the spelling to the modern way . The original , as I am informed , is now in the hands of the ingenious Dr. Woodward , F. R. S. where , I suppose , the curious will not be refused the satisfaction of seeing it .</p>
     <p>“ The lines seem to be a sort of prophecy , and written in verse , as old prophecies usually are , but in a very hobbling kind of measure . Their meaning is very dark , if it be any at all ; of which the learned reader can judge better than I : however it be , several persons were of opinion that they deserved to be published , both as they discover somewhat of the genius of a former age , and may be an amusement to the present . ” — Swift .</p>
     <p>The subject of this virulent satire was Elizabeth , Baroness Percy , daughter and heiress of Josceline , Earl of Northumberland , who died in 1670 . She was born in 1666 . In 1679 she was married to Henry Cavendish , Earl of Ogle , who died in 1680 . In 1681 , she married Thomas Thynne , a man of great wealth , a friend of the Duke of Monmouth and the Issachar of Dryden 's “ Absalom and Achitophel . ” A few months afterwards , in February 1681-2 , Thynne was assassinated in the Haymarket by foreigners , who were devoted friends of Count Konigsmark , and appear to have acted under his direction . The Count had been in London shortly before Lady Ogle 's marriage to Thynne , and had then paid his addresses to her . He fled the day after the murder , but was brought back , and was tried with the principals as an accessory , but was acquitted . Four months after the murder of Thynne , his widow was married to Charles Seymour , Duke of Somerset , on 30th May , 1682 , and ultimately became the favourite and friend of Queen Anne , and a zealous partisan of the Whig party .

     <note xml:id="note1_39" place="bottom" n="1">This ballad refers to some details in the life of Mrs. de la Rivière Manley , a political writer , who was born about 1672 , and died in July , 1724 . The work by which she became famous was “ Secret memoirs and manners of several persons of quality of both sexes , from the New Atalantis . ” She was Swift 's amanuensis and assistant in “ The Examiner , ” and succeeded him as Editor . In his Journal to Stella , Jan. 26 , 1711-12 , he writes : “ Poor Mrs. Manley , the author , is very ill of a dropsy and sore leg ; the printer tells me he is afraid she cannot live long . I am heartily sorry for her . She has very generous principles for one of her sort ; and a great deal of good sense and invention : She is about forty , very homely and very fat . ” Swift 's subsequent severe attack upon her in these verses can only be accounted for , but cannot be excused by , some change in his political views .

      <head>TOLAND 'S INVITATION TO DISMAL<span corresp="#note1_42" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>TO DINE WITH THE CALVES ’ HEAD CLUB</head>
       <l n="1">Written A. D . 1712 .— Stella .</l>
       <l n="2">Imitated from Horace , Lib . i , Epist . 5 .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Toland , the Deist , distinguished himself as a party writer in behalf of the Whigs . He wrote a pamphlet on the demolition of Dunkirk , and another called “ The Art of Reasoning , ” in which he directly charged Oxford with the purpose of bringing in the Pretender . The Earl of Nottingham , here , as elsewhere , called Dismal from his swarthy complexion , was bred a rigid High-Churchman , and was only induced to support the Whigs , in their resolutions against a peace , by their consenting to the bill against occasional conformity . He was so distinguished for regularity , as to be termed by Rowe “ The sober Earl of Nottingham , Of sober sire descended . ” — HOR ., Odes , ii , 4 . From these points of his character , we may estimate the severity of the following satire , which represents this pillar of High-Church principles as invited by the republican Toland to solemnize the 30th January , by attending the Calves ’ Head Club .— Scott .</p>

       <l n="1">Harley , the nation 's great support ,</l>
       <l n="2">Returning home one day from court ,</l>
       <l n="3">His mind with public cares possest ,</l>
       <l n="4">All Europe 's business in his breast ,</l>
       <l n="5">Observed a parson near Whitehall ,</l>
       <l n="6">Cheap'ning old authors on a stall .</l>
       <l n="7">The priest was pretty well in case ,</l>
       <l n="8">And show 'd some humour in his face ;</l>
       <l n="9">Look 'd with an easy , careless mien ,</l>
       <l n="10">A perfect stranger to the spleen ;</l>
       <l n="11">Of size that might a pulpit fill ,</l>
       <l n="12">But more inclining to sit still .</l>
       <l n="13">My lord , ( who , if a man may say't ,</l>
       <l n="14">Loves mischief better than his meat ) ,</l>
       <l n="15">Was now disposed to crack a jest</l>
       <l n="16">And bid friend Lewis<span corresp="#note2_32" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>go in quest .</l>
       <l n="17">( This Lewis was a cunning shaver ,</l>
       <l n="18">And very much in Harley 's favour ) —</l>
       <l n="19">In quest who might this parson be ,</l>
       <l n="20">What was his name , of what degree ;</l>
       <l n="21">If possible , to learn his story ,</l>
       <l n="22">And whether he were Whig or Tory .</l>
       <l n="23">Lewis his patron 's humour knows ;</l>
       <l n="24">Away upon his errand goes ,</l>
       <l n="25">And quickly did the matter sift ;</l>
       <l n="26">Found out that it was Doctor Swift ,</l>
       <l n="27">A clergyman of special note</l>
       <l n="28">For shunning those of his own coat ;</l>
       <l n="29">Which made his brethren of the gown</l>
       <l n="30">Take care betimes<span corresp="#note3_20" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>to run him down :</l>
       <l n="31">No libertine , nor over nice ,</l>
       <l n="32">Addicted to no sort of vice ;</l>
       <l n="33">Went where he pleas 'd , said what he thought ;</l>
       <l n="34">Not rich , but owed no man a groat ;</l>
       <l n="35">In state opinions à la mode ,</l>
       <l n="36">He hated Wharton like a toad ;</l>
       <l n="37">Had given the faction many a wound ,</l>
       <l n="38">And libell 'd all the junto round ;</l>
       <l n="39">Kept company with men of wit ,</l>
       <l n="40">Who often father 'd what he writ :</l>
       <l n="41">His works were hawk 'd in ev'ry street ,</l>
       <l n="42">But seldom rose above a sheet :</l>
       <l n="43">Of late , indeed , the paper-stamp</l>
       <l n="44">Did very much his genius cramp ;</l>
       <l n="45">And , since he could not spend his fire ,</l>
       <l n="46">He now intended<span corresp="#note4_14" type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>to retire .</l>
       <l n="47">Said Harley , “ I desire to know</l>
       <l n="48">From his own mouth , if this be so :</l>
       <l n="49">Step to the doctor straight , and say ,</l>
       <l n="50">I 'd have him dine with me to-day . ”</l>
       <l n="51">Swift seem 'd to wonder what he meant ,</l>
       <l n="52">Nor could believe my lord had sent ;</l>
       <l n="53">So never offer 'd once to stir ,</l>
       <l n="54">But coldly said , “ Your servant , sir ! ”</l>
       <l n="55">“ Does he refuse me ? ” Harley cry 'd :</l>
       <l n="56">“ He does ; with insolence and pride . ”</l>
       <l n="57">Some few days after , Harley spies</l>
       <l n="58">The doctor fasten 'd by the eyes</l>
       <l n="59">At Charing-cross , among the rout ,</l>
       <l n="60">Where painted monsters are hung out :</l>
       <l n="61">He pull 'd the string , and stopt his<span corresp="#note5_15" type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>coach ,</l>
       <l n="62">Beck'ning the doctor to approach .</l>
       <l n="63">Swift , who could<span corresp="#note6_13" type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>neither fly nor hide ,</l>
       <l n="64">Came sneaking to<span corresp="#note7_10" type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>the chariot side ,</l>
       <l n="65">And offer 'd many a lame excuse :</l>
       <l n="66">He never meant the least abuse —</l>
       <l n="67">“ My lord — the honour you design 'd —</l>
       <l n="68">Extremely proud — but I had dined —</l>
       <l n="69">I am sure I never should neglect —</l>
       <l n="70">No man alive has more respect ” —</l>
       <l n="71">Well , I shall think of that no more ,</l>
       <l n="72">If you 'll be sure to come at four . ”</l>
       <l n="73">The doctor now obeys the summons ,</l>
       <l n="74">Likes both his company and commons ;</l>
       <l n="75">Displays his talent , sits till ten ;</l>
       <l n="76">Next day invited , comes again ;</l>
       <l n="77">Soon grows domestic , seldom fails ,</l>
       <l n="78">Either at morning or at meals ;</l>
       <l n="79">Came early , and departed late ;</l>
       <l n="80">In short , the gudgeon took the bait .</l>
       <l n="81">My lord would carry on the jest ,</l>
       <l n="82">And down to Windsor takes his guest .</l>
       <l n="83">Swift much admires the place and air ,</l>
       <l n="84">And longs to be a Canon there ;</l>
       <l n="85">In summer round the Park to ride ,</l>
       <l n="86">In winter — never to reside .</l>
       <l n="87">A Canon !— that 's a place too mean :</l>
       <l n="88">No , doctor , you shall be a Dean ;</l>
       <l n="89">Two dozen canons round your stall ,</l>
       <l n="90">And you the tyrant o'er them all :</l>
       <l n="91">You need but cross the Irish seas ,</l>
       <l n="92">To live in plenty , power , and ease .</l>
       <l n="93">Poor Swift departed , and , what 's worse ,</l>
       <l n="94">With borrow 'd money in his purse ,</l>
       <l n="95">Travels at least a hundred leagues ,</l>
       <l n="96">And suffers numberless fatigues .</l>
       <l n="97">Suppose him now a dean complete ,</l>
       <l n="98">Demurely<span corresp="#note8_8" type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>lolling in his seat ,</l>
       <l n="99">And silver verge , with decent pride ,</l>
       <l n="100">Stuck underneath his cushion side .</l>
       <l n="101">Suppose him gone through all vexations ,</l>
       <l n="102">Patents , instalments , abjurations ,</l>
       <l n="103">First-fruits , and tenths , and chapter-treats ;</l>
       <l n="104">Dues , payments , fees , demands , and cheats .</l>
       <l n="105">( The wicked laity ’ s contriving</l>
       <l n="106">To hinder clergymen from thriving . )</l>
       <l n="107">Now all the doctor 's money ’ s spent ,</l>
       <l n="108">His tenants wrong him in his rent ,</l>
       <l n="109">The farmers spitefully combine ,</l>
       <l n="110">Force him to take his tithes in kine ,</l>
       <l n="111">And Parvisol<span corresp="#note9_8" type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>discounts arrears</l>
       <l n="112">By bills , for taxes and repairs .</l>
       <l n="113">Poor Swift , with all his losses vex 'd ,</l>
       <l n="114">Not knowing where to turn him next ,</l>
       <l n="115">Above a thousand pounds in debt ,</l>
       <l n="116">Takes horse , and in a mighty fret</l>
       <l n="117">Rides day and night at such a rate ,</l>
       <l n="118">He soon arrives at Harley 's gate ;</l>
       <l n="119">But was so dirty , pale , and thin ,</l>
       <l n="120">Old Read<span corresp="#note10_7" type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>would hardly let him in .</l>
       <l n="121">Said Harley , “ Welcome , rev'rend dean !</l>
       <l n="122">What makes your worship look so lean ?</l>
       <l n="123">Why , sure you wo n't appear in town</l>
       <l n="124">In that old wig and rusty gown ?</l>
       <l n="125">I doubt your heart is set on pelf</l>
       <l n="126">So much that you neglect yourself .</l>
       <l n="127">What ! I suppose , now stocks are high ,</l>
       <l n="128">You 've some good purchase in your eye ?</l>
       <l n="129">Or is your money out at use ? ” —</l>
       <l n="130">“ Truce , good my lord , I beg a truce ! ”</l>
       <l n="131">The doctor in a passion cry 'd ,</l>
       <l n="132">“ Your raillery is misapply 'd ;</l>
       <l n="133">Experience I have<span corresp="#note11_7" type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>dearly bought ;</l>
       <l n="134">You know I am not worth a groat :</l>
       <l n="135">But you resolved to have your jest ,</l>
       <l n="136">And ‘ twas a folly to contest ;</l>
       <l n="137">Then , since you now have done your worst ,</l>

     <note xml:id="note1_43" place="bottom" n="1">Dr. John Sharpe , who , for some unbecoming reflections in his sermons , had been suspended , May 14 , 1686 , was raised from the Deanery of Canterbury , to the Archbishopric of York , July 5 , 1691 ; and died February 2 , 1712-13 . According to Dr . Swift 's account , the archbishop had represented him to the queen as a person that was not a Christian ; the great lady [ the Duchess of Somerset ] had supported the aspersion ; and the queen , upon such assurances , had given away the bishopric contrary to her majesty 's first intentions [ which were in favour of Swift ] .

     <note xml:id="note3_24" place="bottom" n="3">Swift was perpetually expressing his deep discontent at his Irish preferment , and forming schemes for exchanging it for a smaller in England , and courted Queen Caroline and Sir Robert Walpole to effect such a change . A negotiation had nearly taken place between the Dean and Mr. Talbot for the living of Burfield , in Berkshire . Mr. Talbot himself informed me of this negotiation . Burfield is in the neighbourhood of Bucklebury , Lord Bolingbroke 's seat .— Warton .</note>

     <note xml:id="note5_14" place="bottom" n="5">The rise and progress of Swift 's intimacy with Lord Oxford is minutely detailed in his Journal to Stella . And the reasons why a man , that served the ministry so effectually , was so tardily , and so difficultly , and so poorly rewarded , are explained in Sheridan 's Life of Swift . See also Coxe 's “ Memoirs of Walpole . ” Both Gay and Swift conceived every thing was to be gained by the interest of Mrs. Howard , to whom they paid incessant court .— Bowles .</note>
     <note xml:id="note6_13" place="bottom" n="6">Another of their amusements in these excursions consisted in Lord Oxford and Swift 's counting the poultry on the road , and whichever reckoned thirty-one first , or saw a cat , or an old woman , won the game . Bolingbroke , overtaking them one day in their road to Windsor , got into Lord Oxford 's coach , and began some political conversation ; Lord Oxford said , “ Swift , I am up ; there is a cat . ” Bolingbroke was disgusted with this levity , and went again into his own carriage .

      <head>WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1715 , ON AN ATTEMPT TO REPEAL THE TEST ACT</head>
       <l n="1">A bitch , that was full pregnant grown</l>
       <l n="2">By all the dogs and curs in town ,</l>
       <l n="3">Finding her ripen 'd time was come ,</l>
       <l n="4">Her litter teeming from her womb ,</l>
       <l n="5">Went here , and there , and everywhere ,</l>
       <l n="6">To find an easy place to lay her .</l>
       <l n="7">At length to Music 's house<span corresp="#note2_37" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>she came ,</l>
       <l n="8">And begg 'd like one both blind and lame ;</l>
       <l n="9">“ My only friend , my dear , ” said she ,</l>
       <l n="10">“ You see ‘ tis mere necessity</l>
       <l n="11">Hath sent me to your house to whelp :</l>
       <l n="12">I die if you refuse your help . ”</l>
       <l n="13">With fawning whine , and rueful tone ,</l>
       <l n="14">With artful sigh , and feigned groan ,</l>
       <l n="15">With couchant cringe , and flattering tale ,</l>
       <l n="16">Smooth Bawty<span corresp="#note3_26" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>did so far prevail ,</l>
       <l n="17">That Music gave her leave to litter ;</l>
       <l n="18">( But mark what follow 'd — faith ! she bit her ;)</l>
       <l n="19">Whole baskets full of bits and scraps ,</l>
       <l n="20">And broth enough to fill her paps ;</l>
       <l n="21">For well she knew , her numerous brood ,</l>
       <l n="22">For want of milk , would suck her blood .</l>
       <l n="23">But when she thought her pains were done ,</l>
       <l n="24">And now ‘ twas high time to be gone ,</l>
       <l n="25">In civil terms , “ My friend , ” said she ,</l>
       <l n="26">“ My house you 've had on courtesy ;</l>
       <l n="27">And now I earnestly desire ,</l>
       <l n="28">That you would with your cubs retire ;</l>
       <l n="29">For , should you stay but one week longer ,</l>
       <l n="30">I shall be starved with cold and hunger . ”</l>
       <l n="31">The guest replied — “ My friend , your leave</l>
       <l n="32">I must a little longer crave ;</l>
       <l n="33">Stay till my tender cubs can find</l>
       <l n="34">Their way — for now , you see , they 're blind ;</l>
       <l n="35">But , when we 've gather 'd strength , I swear ,</l>
       <l n="36">We 'll to our barn again repair . ”</l>
       <l n="37">The time pass 'd on ; and Music came</l>
       <l n="38">Her kennel once again to claim ,</l>
       <l n="39">But Bawty , lost to shame and honour ,</l>
       <l n="40">Set all her cubs at once upon her ;</l>
       <l n="41">Made her retire , and quit her right ,</l>
       <l n="42">And loudly cried — “ A bite ! bite ! ”</l>

       <l n="11">Virtue , to crown her favourites , loves to try</l>

       <l n="13">Where Jove a seat among the gods will give</l>
       <l n="14">To those who die , for meriting to live .</l>

      <head>A TALE OF A NETTLE<span corresp="#note1_52" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></head>
       <l n="1">A man with expense and infinite toil ,</l>
       <l n="2">By digging and dunging , ennobled his soil ;</l>
       <l n="3">There fruits of the best your taste did invite ,</l>
       <l n="4">And uniform order still courted the sight .</l>
       <l n="5">No degenerate weeds the rich ground did produce ,</l>
       <l n="6">But all things afforded both beauty and use :</l>
       <l n="7">Till from dunghill transplanted , while yet but a seed ,</l>
       <l n="8">A nettle rear 'd up his inglorious head .</l>
       <l n="9">The gard'ner would wisely have rooted him up ,</l>
       <l n="10">To stop the increase of a barbarous crop ;</l>
       <l n="11">But the master forbid him , and after the fashion</l>
       <l n="12">Of foolish good nature , and blind moderation ,</l>
       <l n="13">Forbore him through pity , and chose as much rather ,</l>
       <l n="14">To ask him some questions first , how he came thither .</l>
       <l n="15">Kind sir , quoth the nettle , a stranger I come ,</l>
       <l n="16">For conscience compell 'd to relinquish my home ,</l>
       <l n="17">‘ Cause I would n't subscribe to a mystery dark ,</l>
       <l n="18">That the prince of all trees is the Jesuit 's bark ,<span corresp="#note2_38" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span></l>
       <l n="19">An erroneous tenet I know , sir , that you ,</l>
       <l n="20">No more than myself , will allow to be true .</l>
       <l n="21">To you , I for refuge and sanctuary sue ,</l>
       <l n="22">There 's none so renown 'd for compassion as you ;</l>
       <l n="23">And , though in some things I may differ from these ,</l>
       <l n="24">The rest of your fruitful and beautiful trees ;</l>
       <l n="25">Though your digging and dunging , my nature much harms ,</l>
       <l n="26">And I cannot comply with your garden in forms :</l>
       <l n="27">Yet I and my family , after our fashion ,</l>
       <l n="28">Will peaceably stick to our own education .</l>
       <l n="29">Be pleased to allow them a place for to rest ‘ em ,</l>
       <l n="30">For the rest of your trees we will never molest ‘ em ;</l>
       <l n="31">A kind shelter to us and protection afford ,</l>
       <l n="32">We 'll do you no harm , sir , I 'll give you my word .</l>
       <l n="33">The good man was soon won by this plausible tale ,</l>
       <l n="34">So fraud on good-nature doth often prevail .</l>
       <l n="35">He welcomes his guest , gives him free toleration</l>
       <l n="36">In the midst of his garden to take up his station ,</l>
       <l n="37">And into his breast doth his enemy bring ,</l>
       <l n="38">He little suspected the nettle could sting .</l>
       <l n="39">‘ Till flush 'd with success , and of strength to be fear 'd ,</l>
       <l n="40">Around him a numerous offspring he rear 'd .</l>
       <l n="41">Then the master grew sensible what he had done ,</l>
       <l n="42">And fain he would have his new guest to be gone ;</l>
       <l n="43">But now ‘ twas too late to bid him turn out ,</l>
       <l n="44">A well rooted possession already was got .</l>
       <l n="45">The old trees decay 'd , and in their room grew</l>
       <l n="46">A stubborn , pestilent , poisonous crew .</l>
       <l n="47">The master , who first the young brood had admitted ,</l>
       <l n="48">They stung like ingrates , and left him unpitied .</l>
       <l n="49">No help from manuring or planting was found ,</l>
       <l n="50">The ill weeds had eat out the heart of the ground .</l>
       <l n="51">All weeds they let in , and none they refuse</l>
       <l n="52">That would join to oppose the good man of the house .</l>
       <l n="53">Thus one nettle uncropp 'd , increased to such store ,</l>
       <l n="54">That ‘ twas nothing but weeds what was garden before .</l>

     <note xml:id="note1_53" place="bottom" n="1">Dr. Pratt 's speech , which is here parodied , was made when the Duke of Ormond , Swift 's valued friend , was attainted , and superseded in the office of chancellor of Trinity College , which he had held from 1688-9 , by the Prince of Wales , afterwards George II .</note>
     <p>There is great reason to suppose that the satire is the work of Swift , whose attachment to Ormond was uniformly ardent . Of this it may be worth while to mention a trifling instance . The duke had presented to the cathedral of St. Patrick 's a superb organ , surmounted by his own armorial bearings . It was placed facing the nave of the church . But after Ormond 's attainder , Swift , as Dean of St. Patrick 's , received orders from government to remove the scutcheon from the church . He obeyed , but he placed the shield in the great aisle , where he himself and Stella lie buried , and where the arms still remain . The verses have suffered much by the inaccuracy of the noble transcriber , Lord Newtoun Butler .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">The original speech will be found in the London Gazette of Tuesday ,</l>
       <l n="2">April 17 , 1716 , and Scott 's edition of Swift , vol . xii , p. 352 . The</l>
       <l n="3">Provost , it appears , was attended by the Rev . Dr. Howard , and Mr. George</l>
       <l n="4">Berkeley , ( afterwards Bishop of Cloyne ,) both of them fellows of Trinity</l>
       <l n="5">College , Dublin . The speech was praised by Addison , in the Freeholder ,</l>

       <l n="43">Now , let me tell you plainly , sir ,</l>
       <l n="44">Our witness is a real cur ,</l>
       <l n="45">A dog of spirit for his years ;</l>
       <l n="46">Has twice two legs , two hanging ears ;</l>
       <l n="47">His name is Harlequin , I wot ,</l>
       <l n="48">And that 's a name in every plot :</l>
       <l n="49">Resolved to save the British nation ,</l>
       <l n="50">Though French by birth and education ;</l>
       <l n="51">His correspondence plainly dated ,</l>
       <l n="52">Was all decipher 'd and translated :</l>
       <l n="53">His answers were exceeding pretty ,</l>
       <l n="54">Before the secret wise committee ;</l>
       <l n="55">Confest as plain as he could bark :</l>
       <l n="56">Then with his fore-foot set his mark .</l>
       <l n="57">TORY . Then all this while have I been bubbled ,</l>
       <l n="58">I thought it was a dog in doublet :</l>
       <l n="59">The matter now no longer sticks :</l>
       <l n="60">For statesmen never want dog-tricks .</l>
       <l n="61">But since it was a real cur ,</l>
       <l n="62">And not a dog in metaphor ,</l>
       <l n="63">I give you joy of the report ,</l>
       <l n="64">That he 's to have a place at court .</l>
       <l n="65">WHIG . Yes , and a place he will grow rich in ;</l>
       <l n="66">A turnspit in the royal kitchen .</l>
       <l n="67">Sir , to be plain , I tell you what ,</l>
       <l n="68">We had occasion for a plot ;</l>
       <l n="69">And when we found the dog begin it ,</l>
       <l n="70">We guess 'd the bishop 's foot was in it .</l>
       <l n="71">TORY . I own it was a dangerous project ,</l>
       <l n="72">And you have proved it by dog-logic .</l>
       <l n="73">Sure such intelligence between</l>
       <l n="74">A dog and bishop ne'er was seen ,</l>
       <l n="75">Till you began to change the breed ;</l>

       <l n="30">Whole crowds about its brazen strings .</l>

       <l n="41">Now while this brazen chain prevail 'd ,</l>
       <l n="42">Jove saw that all devotion fail 'd ;</l>
       <l n="43">No temple to his godship raised ;</l>

       <l n="45">In short , such dire confusion follow 'd ,</l>

      <head>WOOD AN INSECT . 1725</head>
       <l n="1">By long observation I have understood ,</l>
       <l n="2">That two little vermin are kin to Will Wood .</l>
       <l n="3">The first is an insect they call a wood-louse ,</l>
       <l n="4">That folds up itself in itself for a house ,</l>
       <l n="5">As round as a ball , without head , without tail ,</l>
       <l n="6">Enclosed cap à pie , in a strong coat of mail .</l>
       <l n="7">And thus William Wood to my fancy appears</l>
       <l n="8">In fillets of brass roll 'd up to his ears ;</l>
       <l n="9">And over these fillets he wisely has thrown ,</l>
       <l n="10">To keep out of danger , a doublet of stone .<span corresp="#note1_63" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></l>
       <l n="11">The louse of the wood for a medicine is used</l>
       <l n="12">Or swallow 'd alive , or skilfully bruised .</l>
       <l n="13">And , let but our mother Hibernia contrive</l>
       <l n="14">To swallow Will Wood , either bruised or alive ,</l>
       <l n="15">She need be no more with the jaundice possest ,</l>
       <l n="16">Or sick of obstructions , and pains in her chest .</l>
       <l n="17">The next is an insect we call a wood-worm ,</l>
       <l n="18">That lies in old wood like a hare in her form ;</l>
       <l n="19">With teeth or with claws it will bite or will scratch ,</l>
       <l n="20">And chambermaids christen this worm a death-watch ;</l>
       <l n="21">Because like a watch it always cries click ;</l>
       <l n="22">Then woe be to those in the house who are sick :</l>
       <l n="23">For , as sure as a gun , they will give up the ghost ,</l>
       <l n="24">If the maggot cries click when it scratches the post ;</l>
       <l n="25">But a kettle of scalding hot-water injected</l>
       <l n="26">Infallibly cures the timber affected ;</l>
       <l n="27">The omen is broken , the danger is over ;</l>
       <l n="28">The maggot will die , and the sick will recover .</l>
       <l n="29">Such a worm was Will Wood , when he scratch 'd at the door</l>
       <l n="30">Of a governing statesman or favourite whore ;</l>
       <l n="31">The death of our nation he seem 'd to foretell ,</l>
       <l n="32">And the sound of his brass we took for our knell .</l>
       <l n="33">But now , since the Drapier has heartily maul 'd him ,</l>
       <l n="34">I think the best thing we can do is to scald him ;</l>
       <l n="35">For which operation there 's nothing more proper</l>
       <l n="36">Than the liquor he deals in , his own melted copper ;</l>
       <l n="37">Unless , like the Dutch , you rather would boil</l>
       <l n="38">This coiner of raps<span corresp="#note2_46" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>in a caldron of oil .</l>
       <l n="39">Then choose which you please , and let each bring a fagot ,</l>
       <l n="40">For our fear 's at an end with the death of the maggot .</l>

       <l n="6">Would sit whole evenings at the alehouse ;</l>

       <l n="8">While he went always drunk to bed .</l>
       <l n="9">This vapouring scab must needs devise</l>
       <l n="10">To ape the thunder of the skies :</l>

       <l n="16">And he must thunder , with a pox .</l>
       <l n="17">Then furious he begins his march ,</l>
       <l n="18">Drives rattling o'er a brazen arch ;</l>
       <l n="19">With squibs and crackers arm 'd to throw</l>
       <l n="20">Among the trembling crowd below .</l>
       <l n="21">All ran to prayers , both priests and laity ,</l>
       <l n="22">To pacify this angry deity ;</l>
       <l n="23">When Jove , in pity to the town ,</l>
       <l n="24">With real thunder knock 'd him down .</l>
       <l n="25">Then what a huge delight were all in ,</l>
       <l n="26">To see the wicked varlet sprawling ;</l>
       <l n="27">They search 'd his pockets on the place ,</l>
       <l n="28">And found his copper all was base ;</l>
       <l n="29">They laugh 'd at such an Irish blunder ,</l>
       <l n="30">To take the noise of brass for thunder .</l>
       <l n="31">The moral of this tale is proper ,</l>
       <l n="32">Applied to Wood 's adulterate copper :</l>
       <l n="33">Which , as he scatter 'd , we , like dolts ,</l>
       <l n="34">Mistook at first for thunderbolts ,</l>
       <l n="35">Before the Drapier shot a letter ,</l>

       <l n="18">( I forget in what church ) an image of wood ;</l>
       <l n="19">Concerning this image , there went a prediction ,</l>
       <l n="20">It would burn a whole forest ; nor was it a fiction .</l>
       <l n="21">‘ Twas cut into fagots and put to the flame ,</l>
       <l n="22">To burn an old friar , one Forest by name ,</l>
       <l n="23">My tale is a wise one , if well understood :</l>
       <l n="24">Find you but the Friar ; and I 'll find the Wood .</l>
       <l n="25">I hear , among scholars there is a great doubt ,</l>
       <l n="26">From what kind of tree this Wood was hewn out ,</l>
       <l n="27">Teague made a good pun by a brogue in his speech :</l>
       <l n="28">And said , “ By my shoul , he 's the son of a BEECH . ”</l>
       <l n="29">Some call him a thorn , the curse of the nation ,</l>
       <l n="30">As thorns were design 'd to be from the creation .</l>
       <l n="31">Some think him cut out from the poisonous yew ,</l>
       <l n="32">Beneath whose ill shade no plant ever grew .</l>
       <l n="33">Some say he ’ s a birch , a thought very odd ;</l>
       <l n="34">For none but a dunce would come under his rod .</l>
       <l n="35">But I 'll tell the secret ; and pray do not blab :</l>
       <l n="36">He is an old stump , cut out of a crab ;</l>
       <l n="37">And England has put this crab to a hard use ,</l>
       <l n="38">To cudgel our bones , and for drink give us ver-juice ;</l>
       <l n="39">And therefore his witnesses justly may boast ,</l>
       <l n="40">That none are more properly knights of the post ,</l>
       <l n="41">But here Mr. Wood complains that we mock ,</l>
       <l n="42">Though he may be a blockhead , he 's no real block .</l>
       <l n="43">He can eat , drink , and sleep ; now and then for a friend</l>
       <l n="44">He 'll not be too proud an old kettle to mend ;</l>
       <l n="45">He can lie like a courtier , and think it no scorn ,</l>
       <l n="46">When gold ’ s to be got , to forswear and suborn .</l>
       <l n="47">He can rap his own raps<span corresp="#note1_66" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>and has the true sapience ,</l>
       <l n="48">To turn a good penny to twenty bad halfpence .</l>
       <l n="49">Then in spite of your sophistry , honest Will Wood</l>
       <l n="50">Is a man of this world , all true flesh and blood ;</l>
       <l n="51">So you are but in jest , and you will not , I hope ,</l>
       <l n="52">Unman the poor knave for the sake of a trope .</l>
       <l n="53">‘ Tis a metaphor known to every plain thinker ,</l>
       <l n="54">Just as when we say , the devil 's a tinker ,</l>
       <l n="55">Which cannot , in literal sense be made good ,</l>
       <l n="56">Unless by the devil we mean Mr. Wood .</l>
       <l n="57">But some will object that the devil oft spoke ,</l>
       <l n="58">In heathenish times , from the trunk of an oak ;</l>
       <l n="59">And since we must grant there never were known</l>
       <l n="60">More heathenish times , than those of our own ;</l>
       <l n="61">Perhaps you will say , ‘ tis the devil that puts</l>
       <l n="62">The words in Wood 's mouth , or speaks from his guts :</l>
       <l n="63">And then your old arguments still will return ;</l>
       <l n="64">Howe'er , let us try him , and see how he 'll burn :</l>
       <l n="65">You 'll pardon me , sir , your cunning I smoke ,</l>
       <l n="66">But Wood , I assure you , is no heart of oak ;</l>
       <l n="67">And , instead of the devil , this son of perdition</l>
       <l n="68">Hath join 'd with himself two hags in commission .</l>
       <l n="69">I ne'er could endure my talent to smother :</l>
       <l n="70">I told you one tale , and I 'll tell you another .</l>
       <l n="71">A joiner to fasten a saint in a niche ,</l>
       <l n="72">Bored a large auger-hole in the image 's breech ;</l>
       <l n="73">But , finding the statue to make no complaint ,</l>
       <l n="74">He would ne'er be convinced it was a true saint .</l>
       <l n="75">When the true Wood arrives , as he soon will , no doubt ,</l>
       <l n="76">( For that 's but a sham Wood they carry about ; [ 2 ])</l>
       <l n="77">What stuff he is made of you quickly may find</l>
       <l n="78">If you make the same trial and bore him behind .</l>
       <l n="79">I 'll hold you a groat , when you wimble his bum ,</l>
       <l n="80">He 'll bellow as loud as the de'il in a drum .</l>
       <l n="81">From me , I declare you shall have no denial ;</l>
       <l n="82">And there can be no harm in making a trial :</l>
       <l n="83">And when to the joy of your hearts he has roar 'd ,</l>
       <l n="84">You may show him about for a new groaning board .</l>
       <l n="85">Now ask me a question . How came it to pass</l>
       <l n="86">Wood got so much copper ? He got it by brass ;</l>
       <l n="87">This brass was a dragon , ( observe what I tell ye ,)</l>
       <l n="88">This dragon had gotten two sows in his belly ;</l>
       <l n="89">I know you will say this is all heathen Greek .</l>
       <l n="90">I own it , and therefore I leave you to seek .</l>
       <l n="91">I often have seen two plays very good ,</l>
       <l n="92">Call 'd Love in a Tub , and Love in a Wood ;</l>
       <l n="93">These comedies twain friend Wood will contrive</l>
       <l n="94">On the scene of this land very soon to revive .</l>
       <l n="95">First , Love in a Tub : Squire Wood has in store</l>
       <l n="96">Strong tubs for his raps , two thousand and more ;</l>
       <l n="97">These raps he will honestly dig out with shovels ,</l>
       <l n="98">And sell them for gold , or he can n't show his love else .</l>
       <l n="99">Wood swears he will do it for Ireland 's good ,</l>
       <l n="100">Then can you deny it is Love in a Wood ?</l>
       <l n="101">However , if critics find fault with the phrase ,</l>
       <l n="102">I hope you will own it is Love in a Maze :</l>
       <l n="103">For when to express a friend 's love you are willing ,</l>
       <l n="104">We never say more than your love is a million ;</l>
       <l n="105">But with honest Wood 's love there is no contending ,</l>
       <l n="106">‘ Tis fifty round millions of love and a mending .</l>
       <l n="107">Then in his first love why should he be crost ?</l>
       <l n="108">I hope he will find that no love is lost .</l>
       <l n="109">Hear one story more , and then I will stop .</l>
       <l n="110">I dreamt Wood was told he should die by a drop :</l>
       <l n="111">So methought he resolved no liquor to taste ,</l>
       <l n="112">For fear the first drop might as well be his last .</l>
       <l n="113">But dreams are like oracles ; ‘ tis hard to explain ‘ em ;</l>
       <l n="114">For it proved that he died of a drop at Kilmainham .<span corresp="#note3_33" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span></l>
       <l n="115">I waked with delight ; and not without hope ,</l>
       <l n="116">Very soon to see Wood drop down from a rope .</l>
       <l n="117">How he , and how we at each other should grin !</l>
       <l n="118">‘ Tis kindness to hold a friend up by the chin .</l>
       <l n="119">But soft ! says the herald , I cannot agree ;</l>
       <l n="120">For metal on metal is false heraldry .</l>
       <l n="121">Why that may be true ; yet Wood upon Wood ,</l>
       <l n="122">I 'll maintain with my life , is heraldry good .</l>

       <l n="30">Flutters the feeble pamphlet into rags ,</l>
       <l n="31">The nation scared , the author doom 'd to death ,</l>

       <l n="33">A larger sacrifice in vain you vow ;</l>
       <l n="34">There 's not a power above will help you now ;</l>
       <l n="35">A nation thus , who oft Heaven 's call neglects ,</l>
       <l n="36">In vain from injured Heaven relief expects .</l>
       <l n="37">‘ Twill not avail , when thy strong sides are broke</l>
       <l n="38">That thy descent is from the British oak ;</l>
       <l n="39">Or , when your name and family you boast ,</l>
       <l n="40">From fleets triumphant o'er the Gallic coast .</l>
       <l n="41">Such was Ierne 's claim , as just as thine ,</l>
       <l n="42">Her sons descended from the British line ;</l>
       <l n="43">Her matchless sons , whose valour still remains</l>
       <l n="44">On French records for twenty long campaigns ;</l>
       <l n="45">Yet , from an empress now a captive grown ,</l>
       <l n="46">She saved Britannia 's rights , and lost her own .</l>
       <l n="47">In ships decay 'd no mariner confides ,</l>
       <l n="48">Lured by the gilded stern and painted sides :</l>
       <l n="49">Yet at a ball unthinking fools delight</l>
       <l n="50">In the gay trappings of a birth-day night :</l>
       <l n="51">They on the gold brocades and satins raved ,</l>
       <l n="52">And quite forgot their country was enslaved .</l>
       <l n="53">Dear vessel , still be to thy steerage just ,</l>
       <l n="54">Nor change thy course with every sudden gust ;</l>
       <l n="55">Like supple patriots of the modern sort ,</l>
       <l n="56">Who turn with every gale that blows from court .</l>
       <l n="57">Weary and sea-sick , when in thee confined ,</l>
       <l n="58">Now for thy safety cares distract my mind ;</l>
       <l n="59">As those who long have stood the storms of state</l>
       <l n="60">Retire , yet still bemoan their country 's fate .</l>
       <l n="61">Beware , and when you hear the surges roar ,</l>
       <l n="62">Avoid the rocks on Britain 's angry shore .</l>
       <l n="63">They lie , alas ! too easy to be found ;</l>
       <l n="64">For thee alone they lie the island round .</l>

       <l n="12">The glorious founder of their kingly race :</l>
       <l n="13">Thy martial sons , whom now they dare despise ,</l>
       <l n="14">Did once their land subdue and civilize ;</l>

       <l n="29">My prelates and my students , sent from hence ,</l>
       <l n="30">Made your sons converts both to God and sense :</l>
       <l n="31">Not like the pastors of thy ravenous breed ,</l>

       <l n="60">Sent in my anger from the land of Huns !</l>
       <l n="61">With harpy-claws it undermines the ground ,</l>

     <p>M. I own , ‘ tis not my bread and butter , But prithee , Tim , why all this clutter ? Why ever in these raging fits , Damning to hell the Jacobites ? When if you search the kingdom round , There 's hardly twenty to be found ; No , not among the priests and friars —— T. ‘ Twixt you and me , G — d d — n the liars ! M. The Tories are gone every man over To our illustrious house of Hanover ; From all their conduct this is plain ; And then —— T. G — d d — n the liars again ! Did not an earl but lately vote , To bring in ( I could cut his throat ) Our whole accounts of public debts ? M. Lord , how this frothy coxcomb frets ! [ Aside . T. Did not an able statesman bishop This dangerous horrid motion dish up As Popish craft ? did he not rail o n't ? Show fire and fagot in the tail o n't ? Proving the earl a grand offender ; And in a plot for the Pretender ; Whose fleet , ‘ tis all our friends ’ opinion , Was then embarking at Avignon ? M. These wrangling jars of Whig and Tory , Are stale and worn as Troy-town story : The wrong , ‘ tis certain , you were both in , And now you find you fought for nothing . Your faction , when their game was new , Might want such noisy fools as you ; But you , when all the show is past , Resolve to stand it out the last ; Like Martin Marall ,<span corresp="#note2_50" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>gaping on , Not minding when the song is done . When all the bees are gone to settle , You clatter still your brazen kettle . The leaders whom you listed under , Have dropt their arms , and seized the plunder ; And when the war is past , you come To rattle in their ears your drum : And as that hateful hideous Grecian , Thersites ,<span corresp="#note3_34" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>( he was your relation ,) Was more abhorr 'd and scorn 'd by those With whom he served , than by his foes ; So thou art grown the detestation Of all thy party through the nation : Thy peevish and perpetual teasing With plots , and Jacobites , and treason , Thy busy never-meaning face , Thy screw'dhYpppHeNup front , thy state grimace , Thy formal nods , important sneers , Thy whisperings foisted in all ears , ( Which are , whatever you may think , But nonsense wrapt up in a stink ,) Have made thy presence , in a true sense , To thy own side , so d — n 'd a nuisance , That , when they have you in their eye , As if the devil drove , they fly . T. My good friend Mullinix , forbear ; I vow to G —, you 're too severe : If it could ever yet be known I took advice , except my own , It should be yours ; but , d — n my blood ! I must pursue the public good : The faction ( is it not notorious ? )<span corresp="#note4_25" type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>Keck at the memory of Glorious :[ 5 ] ‘ Tis true ; nor need I to be told , My quondam friends are grown so cold , That scarce a creature can be found To prance with me his statue round . The public safety , I foresee , Henceforth depends alone on me ; And while this vital breath I blow , Or from above or from below , I 'll sputter , swagger , curse , and rail , The Tories ’ terror , scourge , and flail . M. Tim , you mistake the matter quite ; The Tories ! you are their delight ; And should you act a different part , Be grave and wise , ‘ twould break their heart . Why , Tim , you have a taste you know , And often see a puppet-show : Observe the audience is in pain , While Punch is hid behind the scene : But , when they hear his rusty voice , With what impatience they rejoice ! And then they value not two straws , How Solomon decides the cause , Which the true mother , which pretender Nor listen to the witch of Endor . Should Faustus with the devil behind him Enter the stage , they never mind him : If Punch , to stir their fancy , shows In at the door his monstrous nose , Then sudden draws it back again ; O what a pleasure mixt with pain ! You every moment think an age , Till he appears upon the stage : And first his bum you see him clap Upon the Queen of Sheba 's lap : The Duke of Lorraine drew his sword ; Punch roaring ran , and running roar 'd , Reviled all people in his jargon , And sold the King of Spain a bargain ; St. George himself he plays the wag on , And mounts astride upon the dragon ; He gets a thousand thumps and kicks , Yet cannot leave his roguish tricks ; In every action thrusts his nose ; The reason why , no mortal knows : In doleful scenes that break our heart , Punch comes like you , and lets a fart . There 's not a puppet made of wood , But what would hang him if they could ; While , teasing all , by all he 's teased , How well are the spectators pleased ! Who in the motion<span corresp="#note6_20" type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>have no share , But purely come to hear and stare ; Have no concern for Sabra 's sake , Which gets the better , saint or snake , Provided Punch ( for there 's the jest ) Be soundly maul 'd , and plague the rest . Thus , Tim , philosophers suppose , The world consists of puppet-shows ; Where petulant conceited fellows Perform the part of Punchinelloes : So at this booth which we call Dublin , Tim , thou'rt the Punch to stir up trouble in : You wriggle , fidge , and make a rout , Put all your brother puppets out , Run on in a perpetual round , To tease , perplex , disturb , confound : Intrude with monkey grin and clatter To interrupt all serious matter ; Are grown the nuisance of your clan , Who hate and scorn you to a man : But then the lookers-on , the Tories , You still divert with merry stories , They would consent that all the crew Were hang 'd before they 'd part with you . But tell me , Tim , upon the spot , By all this toil what hast thou got ? If Tories must have all the sport , I fear you 'll be disgraced at court . T. Got ? D — n my blood ! I frank my letters , Walk to my place before my betters ; And , simple as I now stand here , Expect in time to be a peer — Got ? D — n me ! why I got my will ! Ne'er hold my peace , and ne'er stand still : I fart with twenty ladies by ; They call me beast ; and what care I ? I bravely call the Tories Jacks , And sons of whores — behind their backs . But could you bring me once to think , That when I strut , and stare , and stink , Revile and slander , fume and storm , Betray , make oath , impeach , inform , With such a constant loyal zeal To serve myself and commonweal , And fret the Tories ’ souls to death , I did but lose my precious breath ; And , when I damn my soul to plague ‘ em , Am , as you tell me , but their May-game ; Consume my vitals ! they shall know , I am not to be treated so ; I 'd rather hang myself by half , Than give those rascals cause to laugh . But how , my friend , can I endure , Once so renown 'd , to live obscure ? No little boys and girls to cry , “ There 's nimble Tim a-passing by ! ” No more my dear delightful way tread Of keeping up a party hatred ? Will none the Tory dogs pursue , When through the streets I cry halloo ? Must all my d — n me 's ! bloods and wounds ! Pass only now for empty sounds ? Shall Tory rascals be elected , Although I swear them disaffected ? And when I roar , “ a plot , a plot ! ” Will our own party mind me not ? So qualified to swear and lie , Will they not trust me for a spy ? Dear Mullinix , your good advice I beg ; you see the case is nice : O ! were I equal in renown , Like thee to please this thankless town ! Or blest with such engaging parts To win the truant schoolboys ’ hearts ! Thy virtues meet their just reward , Attended by the sable guard . Charm 'd by thy voice , the ‘ prentice drops The snow-ball destined at thy chops ; Thy graceful steps , and colonel 's air , Allure the cinder-picking fair . M. No more — in mark of true affection , I take thee under my protection ; Your parts are good , ‘ tis not denied ; I wish they had been well applied . But now observe my counsel , ( viz . ) Adapt your habit to your phiz ; You must no longer thus equip ye , As Horace says optat ephippia ; ( There 's Latin , too , that you may see How much improved by Dr .—) I have a coat at home , that you may try : ‘ Tis just like this , which hangs by geometry ; My hat has much the nicer air ; Your block will fit it to a hair ; That wig , I would not for the world Have it so formal , and so curl 'd ; ‘ Twill be so oily and so sleek , When I have lain in it a week , You 'll find it well prepared to take The figure of toupee and snake . Thus dress 'd alike from top to toe , That which is which ‘ tis hard to know , When first in public we appear , I 'll lead the van , keep you the rear : Be careful , as you walk behind ; Use all the talents of your mind ; Be studious well to imitate My portly motion , mien , and gait ; Mark my address , and learn my style , When to look scornful , when to smile ; Nor sputter out your oaths so fast , But keep your swearing to the last . Then at our leisure we 'll be witty , And in the streets divert the city ; The ladies from the windows gaping , The children all our motions aping . Your conversation to refine , I 'll take you to some friends of mine , Choice spirits , who employ their parts To mend the world by useful arts ; Some cleansing hollow tubes , to spy Direct the zenith of the sky ; Some have the city in their care , From noxious steams to purge the air ; Some teach us in these dangerous days How to walk upright in our ways ; Some whose reforming hands engage To lash the lewdness of the age ; Some for the public service go Perpetual envoys to and fro : Whose able heads support the weight Of twenty ministers of state . We scorn , for want of talk , to jabber Of parties o'er our bonnyclabber ; Nor are we studious to inquire , Who votes for manors , who for hire : Our care is , to improve the mind With what concerns all human kind ; The various scenes of mortal life ; Who beats her husband , who his wife ; Or how the bully at a stroke Knock 'd down the boy , the lantern broke . One tells the rise of cheese and oatmeal ; Another when he got a hot-meal ; One gives advice in proverbs old , Instructs us how to tame a scold ; One shows how bravely Audouin died , And at the gallows all denied ; How by the almanack ‘ tis clear , That herrings will be cheap this year . T. Dear Mullinix , I now lament My precious time so long mispent , By nature meant for nobler ends : O , introduce me to your friends ! For whom by birth I was design 'd , Till politics debased my mind ; I give myself entire to you ; G — - d d — n the Whigs and Tories too !</p>
     <note xml:id="note1_71" place="bottom" n="1">This is a severe satire upon Richard Tighe , Esq ., whom the Dean regarded as the officious informer against Sheridan , in the matter of the choice of a text for the accession of George I , Swift had faithfully promised to revenge the cause of his friend , and has certainly fully redeemed his pledge , in this and the following pasquinades . Mad Mullinix , or Molyneux , was a sort of crazy beggar , a Tory politician in His madness , who haunted the streets of Dublin about this time . In a paper subscribed Dr. Anthony , apparently a mountebank of somewhat the same description , the doctor is made to vindicate his loyalty and regard for the present constitution in church and state , by declaring that he always acted contrary to the politics of Captain John Molyneux . The immediate occasion for publication is assigned in the Intelligencer , in which paper the dialogue first appeared .— Scott .</note>
     <p>“ Having lately had an account , that a certain person of some distinction swore in a public coffee-house , that party should never die while he lived , ( although it has been the endeavour of the best and wisest among us , to abolish the ridiculous appellations of Whig and Tory , and entirely to turn our thoughts to the good of our prince and constitution in church and state ,) I hope those who are well-wishers to our country , will think my labour not ill-bestowed , in giving this gentleman 's principles the proper embellishments which they deserve ; and since Mad Mullinix is the only Tory now remaining , who dares own himself to be so , I hope I may not be censured by those of his party , for making him hold a dialogue with one of less consequence on the other side . I shall not venture so far as to give the Christian nick-name of the person chiefly concerned , lest I should give offence , for which reason I shall call him Timothy , and leave the rest to the conjecture of the world . ” — Intelligencer , No . viii .

       <l n="1">Old Latimer preaching did fairly describe</l>
       <l n="2">A bishop , who ruled all the rest of his tribe ;</l>
       <l n="3">And who is this bishop ? and where does he dwell ?</l>
       <l n="4">Why truly ‘ tis Satan , Archbishop of Hell .</l>
       <l n="5">And He was a primate , and He wore a mitre ,</l>
       <l n="6">Surrounded with jewels of sulphur and nitre .</l>
       <l n="7">How nearly this bishop our bishops resembles !</l>
       <l n="8">But he has the odds , who believes and who trembles ,</l>
       <l n="9">Could you see his grim grace , for a pound to a penny ,</l>
       <l n="10">You 'd swear it must be the baboon of Kilkenny :[ 2 ]</l>
       <l n="11">Poor Satan will think the comparison odious ,</l>
       <l n="12">I wish I could find him out one more commodious ;</l>
       <l n="13">But , this I am sure , the most reverend old dragon</l>
       <l n="14">Has got on the bench many bishops suffragan ;</l>
       <l n="15">And all men believe he resides there incog ,</l>
       <l n="16">To give them by turns an invisible jog .</l>
       <l n="17">Our bishops , puft up with wealth and with pride ,</l>
       <l n="18">To hell on the backs of the clergy would ride .</l>
       <l n="19">They mounted and labour 'd with whip and with spur</l>
       <l n="20">In vain — for the devil a parson would stir .</l>
       <l n="21">So the commons unhors 'd them ; and this was their doom ,</l>
       <l n="22">On their crosiers to ride like a witch on a broom .</l>
       <l n="23">Though they gallop 'd so fast , on the road you may find ‘ em ,</l>
       <l n="24">And have left us but three out of twenty behind ‘ em .</l>
       <l n="25">Lord Bolton 's good grace , Lord Carr and Lord Howard ,<span corresp="#note3_37" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span></l>
       <l n="26">In spite of the devil would still be untoward :</l>
       <l n="27">They came of good kindred , and could not endure</l>
       <l n="28">Their former companions should beg at their door .</l>
       <l n="29">When Christ was betray 'd to Pilate the pretor</l>
       <l n="30">Of a dozen apostles but one proved a traitor :</l>
       <l n="31">One traitor alone , and faithful eleven ;</l>
       <l n="32">But we can afford you six traitors in seven .</l>
       <l n="33">What a clutter with clippings , dividings , and cleavings !</l>
       <l n="34">And the clergy forsooth must take up with their leavings ;</l>
       <l n="35">If making divisions was all their intent ,</l>
       <l n="36">They 've done it , we thank them , but not as they meant ;</l>
       <l n="37">And so may such bishops for ever divide ,</l>
       <l n="38">That no honest heathen would be on their side .</l>
       <l n="39">How should we rejoice , if , like Judas the first ,</l>
       <l n="40">Those splitters of parsons in sunder should burst !</l>
       <l n="41">Now hear an allusion :— A mitre , you know ,</l>
       <l n="42">Is divided above , but united below .</l>
       <l n="43">If this you consider our emblem is right ;</l>
       <l n="44">The bishops divide , but the clergy unite .</l>
       <l n="45">Should the bottom be split , our bishops would dread</l>
       <l n="46">That the mitre would never stick fast on their head :</l>
       <l n="47">And yet they have learnt the chief art of a sovereign ,</l>
       <l n="48">As Machiavel taught them , “ divide and ye govern . ”</l>

       <l n="5">Nor lets him sit as justice on the bench ,</l>

       <l n="20">To save his life he leap 'd into the main .</l>
       <l n="21">But there , alas ! he could no safety find ,</l>
       <l n="22">A pack of dogfish had him in the wind .</l>
       <l n="23">He scours away ; and , to avoid the foe ,</l>
       <l n="24">Descends for shelter to the shades below :</l>
       <l n="25">There Cerberus lay watching in his den ,</l>
       <l n="26">( He had not seen a hare the lord knows when . )</l>

       <l n="29">Hunted from earth , and sea , and hell , he flies</l>
       <l n="30">( Fear lent him wings ) for safety to the skies .</l>

       <l n="32">Behold a foe more fierce than all the rest :</l>
       <l n="33">Sirius , the swiftest of the heavenly pack ,</l>
       <l n="34">Fail 'd but an inch to seize him by the back .</l>
       <l n="35">He fled to earth , but first it cost him dear ;</l>

       <l n="48">To call a swarm of lice his brethren ?</l>
       <l n="49">As Moses , by divine advice ,</l>
       <l n="50">In Egypt turn 'd the dust to lice ;</l>
       <l n="51">And as our sects , by all descriptions ,</l>
       <l n="52">Have hearts more harden 'd than Egyptians</l>
       <l n="53">As from the trodden dust they spring ,</l>
       <l n="54">And , turn 'd to lice , infest the king :</l>
       <l n="55">For pity 's sake , it would be just ,</l>
       <l n="56">A rod should turn them back to dust .</l>
       <l n="57">Let folks in high or holy stations</l>
       <l n="58">Be proud of owning such relations ;</l>
       <l n="59">Let courtiers hug them in their bosom ,</l>
       <l n="60">As if they were afraid to lose ‘ em :</l>

Swift . ) Upon which thirty-one of the principal inhabitants of that liberty signed a paper to this effect : ‘ That , out of their great love and respect to the Dean , to whom the whole kingdom hath so many obligations , they would endeavour to defend the life and limbs of the said Dean against a certain man and all his ruffians and murderers . ’ With which paper they , in the name of themselves and all the inhabitants of the city , attended the Dean on January 8 , who being extremely ill in bed of a giddiness and deafness , and not able to receive them , immediately dictated a very grateful answer . The occasion of a certain man 's declaration of his villanous design against the Dean , was a frivolous unproved suspicion that he had written some lines in verse reflecting upon him . ” — Scott .</note>

       <l n="19">Rundle a bishop ! well he may ;</l>
       <l n="20">He 's still a Christian more than they .</l>
       <l n="21">We know the subject of their quarrels ;</l>
       <l n="22">The man has learning , sense , and morals .</l>
       <l n="23">There is a reason still more weighty ;</l>

       <l n="25">Has every circumstance to please us ,</l>
       <l n="26">Though fools may doubt his faith in Jesus .</l>

       <l n="28">Now twenty years from court exploded ?</l>
       <l n="29">And is not this objection odd</l>
       <l n="30">From rogues who ne'er believed a God ?</l>

       <l n="46">To have the spirit set to sale .</l>
       <l n="47">Said surly Peter , “ Magus , prithee ,</l>
       <l n="48">Be gone : thy money perish with thee . ”</l>
       <l n="49">Were Peter now alive , perhaps ,</l>

       <l n="51">Could he but make his gift appear</l>
       <l n="52">In rents three thousand pounds a-year .</l>
       <l n="53">Some fancy this promotion odd ,</l>
       <l n="54">As not the handiwork of God ;</l>
       <l n="55">Though e'en the bishops disappointed</l>

      <head>A CHARACTER , PANEGYRIC , AND DESCRIPTION OF THE LEGION CLUB</head>
       <l n="1">1736</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The immediate provocation to this fierce satire upon the Irish Parliament was the introduction of a Bill to put an end to the tithe on pasturage , called agistment , and thus to free the landlords from a legal payment , with severe loss to the Church .</p>
     <p>As I stroll the city , oft I See a building large and lofty , Not a bow-shot from the college ; Half the globe from sense and knowledge By the prudent architect , Placed against the church direct ,<span corresp="#note1_88" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Making good my grandam 's jest , “ Near the church ” — you know the rest .<span corresp="#note2_60" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Tell us what the pile contains ? Many a head that has no brains . These demoniacs let me dub With the name of Legion<span corresp="#note3_41" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>Club . Such assemblies , you might swear , Meet when butchers bait a bear : Such a noise , and such haranguing , When a brother thief 's a hanging : Such a rout and such a rabble Run to hear Jackpudding gabble : Such a crowd their ordure throws On a far less villain 's nose . Could I from the building 's top Hear the rattling thunder drop , While the devil upon the roof ( If the devil be thunder proof ) Should with poker fiery red Crack the stones , and melt the lead ; Drive them down on every skull , When the den of thieves is full ; Quite destroy that harpies ’ nest ; How might then our isle be blest ! For divines allow , that God Sometimes makes the devil his rod ; And the gospel will inform us , He can punish sins enormous . Yet should Swift endow the schools , For his lunatics and fools , With a rood or two of land , I allow the pile may stand . You perhaps will ask me , Why so ? But it is with this proviso : Since the house is like to last , Let the royal grant be pass 'd , That the club have right to dwell Each within his proper cell , With a passage left to creep in And a hole above for peeping . Let them , when they once get in , Sell the nation for a pin ; While they sit a-picking straws , Let them rave of making laws ; While they never hold their tongue , Let them dabble in their dung : Let them form a grand committee , How to plague and starve the city ; Let them stare , and storm , and frown , When they see a clergy gown ; Let them , ere they crack a louse , Call for th'orders of the house ; Let them , with their gosling quills , Scribble senseless heads of bills ; We may , while they strain their throats , Wipe our a — s with their votes . Let Sir Tom ,<span corresp="#note4_27" type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>that rampant ass , Stuff his guts with flax and grass ; But before the priest he fleeces , Tear the Bible all to pieces : At the parsons , Tom , halloo , boy , Worthy offspring of a shoeboy , Footman , traitor , vile seducer , Perjured rebel , bribed accuser , Lay thy privilege aside , From Papist sprung , and regicide ; Fall a-working like a mole , Raise the dirt about thy hole . Come , assist me , Muse obedient ! Let us try some new expedient ; Shift the scene for half an hour , Time and place are in thy power . Thither , gentle Muse , conduct me ; I shall ask , and you instruct me . See , the Muse unbars the gate ; Hark , the monkeys , how they prate ! All ye gods who rule the soul :[ 5 ] Styx , through Hell whose waters roll ! Let me be allow 'd to tell What I heard in yonder Hell . Near the door an entrance gapes ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>Crowded round with antic shapes , Poverty , and Grief , and Care , Causeless Joy , and true Despair ; Discord periwigg 'd with snakes ,'[ 7 ] See the dreadful strides she takes ! By this odious crew beset ,<span corresp="#note8_12" type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>I began to rage and fret , And resolved to break their pates , Ere we enter 'd at the gates ; Had not Clio in the nick<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>Whisper 'd me , “ Lay down your stick . ” What ! said I , is this a mad-house ? These , she answer 'd , are but shadows , Phantoms bodiless and vain , Empty visions of the brain . In the porch Briareus stands ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>Shows a bribe in all his hands ; Briareus the secretary , But we mortals call him Carey .<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>When the rogues their country fleece , They may hope for pence a-piece . Clio , who had been so wise To put on a fool 's disguise , To bespeak some approbation , And be thought a near relation , When she saw three hundred<span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span>brutes All involved in wild disputes , Roaring till their lungs were spent , PRIVILEGE OF PARLIAMENT , Now a new misfortune feels , Dreading to be laid by th ’ heels . Never durst a Muse before Enter that infernal door ; Clio , stifled with the smell , Into spleen and vapours fell , By the Stygian steams that flew From the dire infectious crew . Not the stench of Lake Avernus Could have more offended her nose ; Had she flown but o'er the top , She had felt her pinions drop . And by exhalations dire , Though a goddess , must expire . In a fright she crept away , Bravely I resolved to stay . When I saw the keeper frown , Tipping him with half-a-crown , Now , said I , we are alone , Name your heroes one by one . Who is that hell-featured brawler ? Is it Satan ? No ; ‘ tis Waller .<span type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span>In what figure can a bard dress Jack the grandson of Sir Hardress ? Honest keeper , drive him further , In his looks are Hell and murther ; See the scowling visage drop , Just as when he murder 'd Throp .<span type="note_anchor">[ 14 ]</span>Keeper , show me where to fix On the puppy pair of Dicks : By their lantern jaws and leathern , You might swear they both are brethren : Dick Fitzbaker ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 15 ]</span>Dick the player ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 15 ]</span>Old acquaintance , are you there ? Dear companions , hug and kiss , Toast Old Glorious in your piss ; Tie them , keeper , in a tether , Let them starve and stink together ; Both are apt to be unruly , Lash them daily , lash them duly ; Though ‘ tis hopeless to reclaim them , Scorpion 's rods , perhaps , may tame them .

Those are Allens Jack and Bob ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 18 ]</span>First in every wicked job , Son and brother to a queer Brain-sick brute , they call a peer .

Gallows Carter , Dilks , and Clements , Souse them in their own excrements . Every mischief 's in their hearts ; If they fail , ‘ tis want of parts . Bless us ! Morgan ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 20 ]</span>art thou there , man ? Bless mine eyes ! art thou the chairman ? Chairman to yon damn 'd committee ! Yet I look on thee with pity . Dreadful sight ! what , learned Morgan Metamorphosed to a Gorgon !<span type="note_anchor">[ 21 ]</span>For thy horrid looks , I own , Half convert me to a stone .

Thou ungrateful to thy teachers , Who are all grown reverend preachers ! Morgan , would it not surprise one ! To turn thy nourishment to poison ! When you walk among your books , They reproach you with their looks ; Bind them fast , or from their shelves They 'll come down to right themselves : Homer , Plutarch , Virgil , Flaccus , All in arms , prepare to back us : Soon repent , or put to slaughter Every Greek and Roman author . Will you , in your faction 's phrase , Send the clergy all to graze ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 22 ]</span>And to make your project pass , Leave them not a blade of grass ? How I want thee , humorous Hogarth ! Thou , I hear , a pleasant rogue art . Were but you and I acquainted , Every monster should be painted : You should try your graving tools On this odious group of fools ; Draw the beasts as I describe them : Form their features while I gibe them ; Draw them like ; for I assure you , You will need no car'catura ; Draw them so that we may trace All the soul in every face . Keeper , I must now retire , You have done what I desire : But I feel my spirits spent With the noise , the sight , the scent . “ Pray , be patient ; you shall find Half the best are still behind ! You have hardly seen a score ; I can show two hundred more . ” Keeper , I have seen enough . Taking then a pinch of snuff , I concluded , looking round them , “ May their god , the devil , confound them ! "[ 23 ]</p>

      <head>A TALE FROM DUBLIN .<span corresp="#note1_91" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>WRITTEN IN 1737</head>
       <l n="1">At Dublin 's high feast sat Primate and Dean ,</l>
       <l n="2">Both dress 'd like divines , with band and face clean :</l>
       <l n="3">Quoth Hugh of Armagh , “ The mob is grown bold . ”</l>
       <l n="4">“ Ay , ay , ” quoth the Dean , “ the cause is old gold . ”</l>
       <l n="5">“ No , no , ” quoth the Primate , “ if causes we sift ,</l>
       <l n="6">This mischief arises from witty Dean Swift . ”</l>
       <l n="7">The smart one replied , “ There 's no wit in the case ;</l>
       <l n="8">And nothing of that ever troubled your grace .</l>
       <l n="9">Though with your state sieve your own notions you split ,</l>
       <l n="10">A Boulter by name is no bolter of wit .</l>
       <l n="11">It 's matter of weight , and a mere money job ;</l>
       <l n="12">But the lower the coin the higher the mob .</l>
       <l n="13">Go tell your friend Bob and the other great folk ,</l>
       <l n="14">That sinking the coin is a dangerous joke .</l>
       <l n="15">The Irish dear joys have enough common sense ,</l>
       <l n="16">To treat gold reduced like Wood 's copper pence .</l>
       <l n="17">It is a pity a prelate should die without law ;</l>
       <l n="18">But if I say the word — take care of Armagh ! ”</l>
     </lg>
     <note xml:id="note1_92" place="bottom" n="1">In 1737 , the gold coin had sunk in current value to the amount of 6d . in each guinea , which made it the interest of the Irish dealers to send over their balances in silver . To bring the value of the precious metals nearer to a par , the Primate , Boulter , who was chiefly trusted by the British Government in the administration of Ireland , published a proclamation reducing the value of the gold coin threepence in each guinea . This scheme was keenly opposed by Swift ; and such was the clamour excited against the archbishop , that his house was obliged to be guarded by soldiers . The two following poems relate to this controversy , which was , for the time it lasted , nearly as warm as that about Wood 's halfpence . The first is said to be the paraphrase of a conversation which actually passed between Swift and the archbishop . The latter charged the Dean with inflaming the mob , “ I inflame them ? ” retorted Swift , “ were I to lift but a finger , they would tear you to pieces . ” — Scott .</note>

     <p>EPIGRAMS AGAINST CARTHY BY SWIFT AND OTHERS</p>
     <p>CHARLES CARTHY , a schoolmaster in the city of Dublin , was publisher of a translation of Horace , in which the Latin was printed on the one side , and the English on the other , whence he acquired the name of Mezentius , alluding to the practice of that tyrant , who chained the dead to the living . Carthy was almost continually involved in satirical skirmishes with Dunkin , for whom Swift had a particular friendship , and there is no doubt that the Dean himself engaged in the warfare .— Scott .</p>

      <head>POETICAL EPISTLE TO DR. SHERIDAN</head>
      <head>Some ancient authors wisely write , That he who drinks will wake at night , Will never fail to lose his rest , And feel a streightness in his chest ; A streightness in a double sense , A streightness both of breath and pence : Physicians say , it is but reasonable , He that comes home at hour unseasonable , ( Besides a fall and broken shins , Those smaller judgments for his sins ;) If , when he goes to bed , he meets A teasing wife between the sheets , ‘ Tis six to five he 'll never sleep , But rave and toss till morning peep . Yet harmless Betty must be blamed Because you feel your lungs inflamed But if you would not get a fever , You never must one moment leave her . This comes of all your drunken tricks , Your Parry 's and your brace of Dicks ; Your hunting Helsham in his laboratory Too , was the time you saw that Drab lac a Pery But like the prelate who lives yonder-a , And always cries he is like Cassandra ; I always told you , Mr. Sheridan , If once this company you were rid on , Frequented honest folk , and very few , You 'd live till all your friends were weary of you . But if rack punch you still would swallow , I then forewarn 'd you what would follow . Are the Deanery sober hours ? Be witness for me all ye powers . The cloth is laid at eight , and then We sit till half an hour past ten ; One bottle well might serve for three If Mrs. Robinson drank like me . Ask how I fret when she has beckon 'd To Robert to bring up a second ; I hate to have it in my sight , And drink my share in perfect spite . If Robin brings the ladies word , The coach is come , I ‘ scape a third ; If not , why then I fall a-talking How sweet a night it is for walking ; For in all conscience , were my treasure able , I 'd think a quart a-piece unreasonable ; It strikes eleven ,— get out of doors .— This is my constant farewell Yours , J.

When Swift was gone , it was discovered that he had written the following lines on one of the windows which look into the church-yard . In the year 1780 , the late Archdeacon Caulfield wrote some lines in answer to both . The pane was taken down by Dr. Jones , Bishop of Kilmore , but it has been since restored .— Scott .</note>

     <p>AN EXCELLENT NEW SONG UPON HIS GRACE OUR GOOD LORD ARCHBISHOP OF DUBLIN</p>
     <p>Dr. King , Archbishop of Dublin , stood high in Swift 's estimation by his opposition to Wood 's coinage .</p>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>BY HONEST JO . ONE OF HIS GRACE 'S FARMERS IN FINGAL</head>
       <l n="1">I sing not of the Drapier 's praise , nor yet of William Wood ,</l>
       <l n="2">But I sing of a famous lord , who seeks his country 's good ;</l>
       <l n="3">Lord William 's grace of Dublin town , ‘ tis he that first appears ,</l>
       <l n="4">Whose wisdom and whose piety do far exceed his years .</l>
       <l n="5">In ev'ry council and debate he stands for what is right ,</l>
       <l n="6">And still the truth he will maintain , whate'er he loses by't .</l>
       <l n="7">And though some think him in the wrong , yet still there comes a season</l>
       <l n="8">When every one turns round about , and owns his grace had reason .</l>
       <l n="9">His firmness to the public good , as one that knows it swore ,</l>
       <l n="10">Has lost his grace for ten years past ten thousand pounds and more .</l>
       <l n="11">Then come the poor and strip him so , they leave him not a cross ,</l>
       <l n="12">For he regards ten thousand pounds no more than Wood 's dross .</l>
       <l n="13">To beg his favour is the way new favours still to win ,</l>
       <l n="14">He makes no more to give ten pounds than I to give a pin .</l>
       <l n="15">Why , there ’ s my landlord now , the squire , who all in money wallows ,</l>
       <l n="16">He would not give a groat to save his father from the gallows .</l>
       <l n="17">“ A bishop , ” says the noble squire , “ I hate the very name ,</l>
       <l n="18">To have two thousand pounds a-year — O ‘ tis a burning shame !</l>
       <l n="19">Two thousand pounds a-year ! good lord ! And I to have but five ! ”</l>
       <l n="20">And under him no tenant yet was ever known to thrive :</l>
       <l n="21">Now from his lordship 's grace I hold a little piece of ground ,</l>
       <l n="22">And all the rent I pay is scarce five shillings in the pound .</l>
       <l n="23">Then master steward takes my rent , and tells me , “ Honest Jo ,</l>
       <l n="24">Come , you must take a cup of sack or two before you go . ”</l>
       <l n="25">He bids me then to hold my tongue , and up the money locks ,</l>
       <l n="26">For fear my lord should send it all into the poor man 's box .</l>
       <l n="27">And once I was so bold to beg that I might see his grace ,</l>
       <l n="28">Good lord ! I wonder how I dared to look him in the face :</l>
       <l n="29">Then down I went upon my knees , his blessing to obtain ;</l>
       <l n="30">He gave it me , and ever since I find I thrive amain .</l>
       <l n="31">“ Then , ” said my lord , “ I 'm very glad to see thee , honest friend ,</l>
       <l n="32">I know the times are something hard , but hope they soon will mend ,</l>
       <l n="33">Pray never press yourself for rent , but pay me when you can ;</l>
       <l n="34">I find you bear a good report , and are an honest man . ”</l>
       <l n="35">Then said his lordship with a smile , “ I must have lawful cash ,</l>
       <l n="36">I hope you will not pay my rent in that same Wood 's trash ! ”</l>
       <l n="37">“ God bless your Grace , ” I then replied , “ I 'd see him hanging higher ,</l>
       <l n="38">Before I 'd touch his filthy dross , than is Clandalkin spire . ”</l>
       <l n="39">To every farmer twice a-week all round about the Yoke ,</l>
       <l n="40">Our parsons read the Drapier 's books , and make us honest folk .</l>
       <l n="41">And then I went to pay the squire , and in the way I found ,</l>
       <l n="42">His bailie driving all my cows into the parish pound ;</l>
       <l n="43">“ Why , sirrah , ” said the noble squire , “ how dare you see my face ,</l>
       <l n="44">Your rent is due almost a week , beside the days of grace . ”</l>
       <l n="45">And yet the land I from him hold is set so on the rack ,</l>
       <l n="46">That only for the bishop 's lease ‘ twould quickly break my back .</l>
       <l n="47">Then God preserve his lordship 's grace , and make him live as long</l>
       <l n="48">As did Methusalem of old , and so I end my song .</l>

     <p>TO THE CITIZENS<span corresp="#note1_101" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></p>
     <p>And shall the Patriot who maintain 'd your cause , From future ages only meet applause ? Shall he , who timely rose t'his country 's aid , By her own sons , her guardians , be betray 'd ? Did heathen virtues in your hearts reside , These wretches had been damn 'd for parricide . Should you behold , whilst dreadful armies threat The sure destruction of an injured state , Some hero , with superior virtue bless 'd , Avert their rage , and succour the distress 'd ; Inspired with love of glorious liberty , Do wonders to preserve his country free ; He like the guardian shepherd stands , and they Like lions spoil 'd of their expected prey , Each urging in his rage the deadly dart , Resolved to pierce the generous hero 's heart ; Struck with the sight , your souls would swell with grief , And dare ten thousand deaths to his relief , But , if the people he preserved should cry , He went too far , and he deserved to — die , Would not your soul such treachery detest , And indignation boil within your breast , Would not you wish that wretched state preserved , To feel the tenfold ruin they deserved ? If , then , oppression has not quite subdued At once your prudence and your gratitude , If you yourselves conspire not your undoing , And do n't deserve , and wo n't draw down your ruin , If yet to virtue you have some pretence , If yet ye are not lost to common sense , Assist your patriot in your own defence ; That stupid cant , “ he went too far , ” despise , And know that to be brave is to be wise : Think how he struggled for your liberty , And give him freedom , whilst yourselves are free .

     <note xml:id="note1_103" place="bottom" n="1">The Address to the Citizens appears , from the signature M. B ., to have been written by Swift himself , and published when the Prosecution was depending against Harding , the printer of the Drapier 's Letters , and a reward had been proclaimed for the discovery of the author . Some of those who had sided with the Drapier in his arguments , while confined to Wood 's scheme , began to be alarmed , when , in the fourth letter , he entered upon the more high and dangerous matter of the nature of Ireland 's connection with England . The object of these verses is , to encourage the timid to stand by their advocate in a cause which was truly their own .— Scott .</note>

      <head>Since your poetic prancer is turn 'd into Cancer , I 'll tell you at once , sir , I 'm now not your man , sir ; For pray , sir , what pleasure in fighting is found With a coward , who studies to traverse his ground ? When I drew forth my pen , with your pen you ran back ; But I found out the way to your den by its track : From thence the black monster I drew , o ’ my conscience , And so brought to light what before was stark nonsense . When I with my right hand did stoutly pursue , You turn 'd to your left , and you writ like a Jew ; Which , good Mister Dean , I can n't think so fair , Therefore turn about to the right , as you were ; Then if with true courage your ground you maintain , My fame is immortal , when Jonathan 's slain : Who 's greater by far than great Alexander , As much as a teal surpasses a gander ; As much as a game-cock ’ s excell 'd by a sparrow ; As much as a coach is below a wheelbarrow : As much and much more as the most handsome man Of all the whole world is exceeded by Dan .

Ea nostra est conditio , haec nostra querela .

Quàm longum iter famelicus peregi ! nudus , egenus , esuriens , perhorrescens , despectus , mendicans ; sunt lacrymae rerum et mentem carnaria tangunt . In viâ nullum fuit solatium praeterquam quod Horatium , ubi macros in igne turdos versat , perlegi . Catii dapes , Maecenatis convivium , ita me picturâ pascens inani , saepius volvebam . Quid non mortalium pectora cogit Musarum sacra fames ? Haec omnia , quae nostra fuit necessitas , curavi ut scires ; nunc re experiar quid dabis , quid negabis . Vale .</p>

      <head>Dear Tom , I 'm surprised that your verse did not jingle ; But your rhyme was not double , ‘ cause your sight was but single .

Besides , Dick<span corresp="#note1_108" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>forbid me , and call 'd me a fool ; For he says , short as ‘ tis , it will give you a stool .

Nunquid eges visu , dum comples omnia risu ? Heu Sheridan caecus , heu eris nunc cercopithecus .

       <l n="1">Dear Dean , since in cruxes and puns you and I deal ,</l>
       <l n="2">Pray why is a woman a sieve and a riddle ?</l>
       <l n="3">‘ Tis a thought that came into my noddle this morning ,</l>
       <l n="4">In bed as I lay , sir , a-tossing and turning .</l>

       <l n="11">In a sieve , sir , their ancient extraction I quite tell ,</l>

       <l n="15">The reason I send you these lines of rhymes double ,</l>

For all his acquaintance well know that friend Tom is , Whenever he makes one , as good as his promise . Now Phoebus exalted , sits high on his throne , Dividing the heav'ns , dividing my crown , Into poems and business , my skull 's split in two , One side for the lawyers , and t'other for you . With my left eye , I see you sit snug in your stall , With my right I 'm attending the lawyers that scrawl With my left I behold your bellower a cur chase ; With my right I 'm a-reading my deeds for a purchase . My left ear 's attending the hymns of the choir , My right ear is stunn 'd with the noise of the crier . My right hand 's inditing these lines to your reverence , My left is indenting for me and heirs ever-hence . Although in myself I 'm divided in two , Dear Dean , I shall ne'er be divided from you .</p>

      <head>THE DEAN OF ST. PATRICK 'S</head>
      <head>TO THOMAS SHERIDAN</head>
      <head>SIR , I cannot but think that we live in a bad age , O tempora , O mores ! as ‘ tis in the adage . My foot was but just set out from my cathedral , When into my hands comes a letter from the droll . I can n't pray in quiet for you and your verses ; But now let us hear what the Muse from your car says . Hum — excellent good — your anger was stirr 'd ; Well , punners and rhymers must have the last word . But let me advise you , when next I hear from you , To leave off this passion which does not become you ; For we who debate on a subject important , Must argue with calmness , or else will come short o n't . For myself , I protest , I care not a fiddle , For a riddle and sieve , or a sieve and a riddle ; And think of the sex as you please , I 'd as lieve You call them a riddle , as call them a sieve . Yet still you are out , ( though to vex you I 'm loth ,) For I 'll prove it impossible they can be both ; A school-boy knows this , for it plainly appears That a sieve dissolves riddles by help of the shears ; For you can n't but have heard of a trick among wizards , To break open riddles with shears or with scissars . Think again of the sieve , and I 'll hold you a wager , You 'll dare not to question my minor or major .<span corresp="#note1_113" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>A sieve keeps half in , and therefore , no doubt , Like a woman , keeps in less than it lets out . Why sure , Mr . Poet , your head got a-jar , By riding this morning too long in your car : And I wish your few friends , when they next see your cargo , For the sake of your senses would lay an embargo . You threaten the stocks ; I say you are scurrilous And you durst not talk thus , if I saw you at our ale-house . But as for your threats , you may do what you can I despise any poet that truckled to Dan But keep a good tongue , or you 'll find to your smart From rhyming in cars , you may swing in a cart . You found out my rebus with very much modesty ; But thanks to the lady ; I 'm sure she 's too good to ye : Till she lent you her help , you were in a fine twitter ; You hit it , you say ;— you 're a delicate hitter . How could you forget so ungratefully a lass , And if you be my Phoebus , pray who was your Pallas ? As for your new rebus , or riddle , or crux , I will either explain , or repay it by trucks ; Though your lords , and your dogs , and your catches , methinks , Are harder than ever were put by the Sphinx . And thus I am fully revenged for your late tricks , Which is all at present from the DEAN OF ST. PATRICK 'S .</head>

     <p>TO THE DEAN OF ST. PATRICK 'S</p>
     <p>SIR , Your Billingsgate Muse methinks does begin With much greater noise than a conjugal din . A pox of her bawling , her tempora et mores ! What are times now to me ; a'nt I one of the Tories ? You tell me my verses disturb you at prayers ; Oh , oh , Mr. Dean , are you there with your bears ? You pray , I suppose , like a Heathen , to Phoebus , To give his assistance to make out my rebus : Which I do n't think so fair ; leave it off for the future ; When the combat is equal , this God should be neuter . I 'm now at the tavern , where I drink all I can , To write with more spirit ; I 'll drink no more Helicon ; For Helicon is water , and water is weak ; ‘ Tis wine on the gross lee , that makes your Muse speak . This I know by her spirit and life ; but I think She 's much in the wrong to scold in her drink . Her damn 'd pointed tongue pierced almost to my heart ; Tell me of a cart ,— tell me of a ——, I 'd have you to tell on both sides her ears , If she comes to my house , that I 'll kick her down stairs : Then home she shall limping go , squalling out , O my knee ; You shall soon have a crutch to buy for your Melpomene . You may come as her bully , to bluster and swagger ; But my ink is my poison , my pen is my dagger : Stand off , I desire , and mark what I say to you , If you come I will make your Apollo shine through you . Do n't think , sir , I fear a Dean , as I would fear a dun ; Which is all at present from yours , THOMAS SHERIDAN .</p>
     <p>THE DEAN TO THOMAS SHERIDAN</p>
     <p>SIR , When I saw you to-day , as I went with Lord Anglesey , Lord , said I , who 's that parson , how awkwardly dangles he ! When whip you trot up , without minding your betters , To the very coach side , and threaten your letters . Is the poison [ and dagger ] you boast in your jaws , trow ? Are you still in your cart with convitia ex plaustro ? But to scold is your trade , which I soon should be foil 'd in , For scolding is just quasi diceres — school-din : And I think I may say , you could many good shillings get , Were you drest like a bawd , and sold oysters at Billingsgate ; But coach it or cart it , I 'd have you know , sirrah , I 'll write , though I 'm forced to write in a wheelbarrow ; Nay , hector and swagger , you 'll still find me stanch , And you and your cart shall give me carte blanche . Since you write in a cart , keep it tecta et sarta , ‘ Tis all you have for it ; ‘ tis your best Magna Carta ; And I love you so well , as I told you long ago , That I 'll ne'er give my vote for Delenda Cart-ago . Now you write from your cellar , I find out your art , You rhyme as folks fence , in tierce and in cart : Your ink is your poison , your pen is what not ; Your ink is your drink , your pen is your pot . To my goddess Melpomene , pride of her sex , I gave , as you beg , your most humble respects : The rest of your compliment I dare not tell her , For she never descends so low as the cellar ; But before you can put yourself under her banners , She declares from her throne you must learn better manners . If once in your cellar my Phoebus should shine , I tell you I 'd not give a fig for your wine ; So I 'll leave him behind , for I certainly know it , What he ripens above ground , he sours below it . But why should we fight thus , my partner so dear With three hundred and sixty-five poems a-year ? Let 's quarrel no longer , since Dan and George Rochfort Will laugh in their sleeves : I can tell you they watch for't . Then George will rejoice , and Dan will sing highday : Hoc Ithacus velit , et magni mercentur Atridae . JON . SWIFT .</p>

      <head>I 'd have you to know , as sure as you 're Dean , On Thursday my cask of Obrien I 'll drain ; If my wife is not willing , I say she 's a quean ; And my right to the cellar , egad , I 'll maintain As bravely as any that fought at Dunblain : Go tell her it over and over again . I hope , as I ride to the town , it wo n't rain ; For , should it , I fear it will cool my hot brain , Entirely extinguish my poetic vein ; And then I should be as stupid as Kain , Who preach 'd on three heads , though he mention 'd but twain . Now Wardel 's in haste , and begins to complain ; Your most humble servant , dear Sir , I remain , T. S .— N .</head>

   <note>POSTSCRIPT I had forgot to desire you to bring down what I say you have , and you 'll believe me as sure as a gun , and own it ; I mean , what no other mortal in the universe can boast of , your own spirit of pun , and own wit .

[ Footnote 1 : Supposed to mean Dr . Walmsley .— F . ] [ Footnote 2 : Arthur , Earl of Anglesey .— Scott . ] [ Footnote 3 : It was customary with Dr. Sheridan to have a Greek play acted by his head class , just before they entered the university ; and , accordingly , in the year 1720 , the Doctor having fixed on Hippolytus , writ a prologue in English , to be spoken by Master Thom . Putland , one of the youngest children he had in his school . The prologue was very neat and elegant , but extremely puerile , and quite adapted to the childhood of the speaker , who as regularly was taught and rehearsed his part as any of the upper lads did theirs . However , it unfortunately happened that Dr. King , Archbishop of Dublin , had promised Sheridan that he would go and see his lads perform the tragedy . Upon which Dr. Helsham writ another prologue , wherein he laughed egregiously at Sheridan 's ; and privately instructed Master Putland how to act his part ; and at the same time exacted a promise from the child , that no consideration should make him repeat that prologue which he had been taught by Sheridan . When the play was to be acted , the archbishop attended according to his promise ; and Master Putland began Helsham 's prologue , and went through it to the amazement of Sheridan ; which fired him to such a degree ( although he was one of the best-natured men in the world ) that he would have entirely put off the play , had it not been in respect to the archbishop , who was indeed highly complimented in Helsham 's performance . When the play was over , the archbishop was very desirous to hear Sheridan 's prologue ; but all the entreaties of the archbishop , the child 's father , and Sheridan , could not prevail with Master Putland to repeat it , having , he said , promised faithfully that he would not , upon any account whatever ; and therefore insisted that he would keep his word .— F . ] [ Footnote 4 : Dr. James Stopford , Bishop of Cloyne .— F . ] [ Footnote 5 : The seat of —— Hussay , Esq ., in the county of Kildare .— F . ]</note>

O , how I joy to see thee wander , In many a winding loose meander , In circling mazes , smooth and supple , And ending in a clink quadruple ; Loud , yet agreeable withal , Like rivers rattling in their fall ! Thine , sure , is poetry divine , Where wit and majesty combine ; Where every line , as huge as seven , If stretch 'd in length , would reach to Heaven : Here all comparing would be slandering , The least is more than Alexandrine . Against thy verse Time sees with pain , He whets his envious scythe in vain ; For though from thee he much may pare , Yet much thou still wilt have to spare . Thou hast alone the skill to feast With Roman elegance of taste , Who hast of rhymes as vast resources As Pompey 's caterer of courses . O thou , of all the Nine inspired !

Thy verse — ( Ye Gods ! I cannot bear it ) To what , to what shall I compare it ? ‘ Tis like , what I have oft heard spoke on , The famous statue of Laocoon . ‘ Tis like ,— O yes , ‘ tis very like it , The long , long string , with which you fly kite . ‘ Tis like what you , and one or two more , Roar to your Echo<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>in good humour ; And every couplet thou hast writ Concludes with Rhattah-whittah-whit .<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>[ Footnote 1 : These were written all in circles , one within another , as appears from the observations in the following poem by Dr .

But now for your verses ; we tell you , imprimis , The segment so large ‘ twixt your reason and rhyme is , That we walk all about , like a horse in a pound , And , before we find either , our noddles turn round . Sufficient it were , one would think , in your mad rant , To give us your measures of line by a quadrant . But we took our dividers , and found your d — n 'd metre , In each single verse , took up a diameter .

The chord , or the radius , it matters not whether , By which your jade Pegasus , fix 'd in a tether , As his betters are used , shall be lash 'd round the ring , Three fellows with whips , and the Dean holds the string . Will Hancock declares , you are out of your compass , To encroach on his art by writing of bombast ; And has taken just now a firm resolution To answer your style without circumlocution .

Come sit , says my lady ; then whips up her scissar , And cuts out his coxcomb in silk in a trice , sir . Dan sat with attention , and saw with surprise How she lengthen 'd his chin , how she hollow 'd his eyes ; But flatter 'd himself with a secret conceit , That his thin lantern jaws all her art would defeat . Lady Betty observed it , then pulls out a pin , And varies the grain of the stuff to his grin : And , to make roasted silk to resemble his raw-bone , She raised up a thread to the jet of his jaw-bone ; Till at length in exactest proportion he rose , From the crown of his head to the arch of his nose ; And if Lady Betty had drawn him with wig and all , ‘ Tis certain the copy had outdone the original . Well , that 's but my outside , says Dan , with a vapour ; Say you so ? says my lady ; I 've lined it with paper . PATR . DELANY sculpsit . [ Footnote 1 : See vol . i , p. 96 . Dan Jackson 's nose seems to have been a favourite subject for raillery , as in this and some following pieces .— W . E . B . ] ON THE SAME PICTURE Clarissa draws her scissars from the case To draw the lines of poor Dan Jackson 's face ; One sloping cut made forehead , nose , and chin , A nick produced a mouth , and made him grin , Such as in tailor 's measure you have seen . But still were wanting his grimalkin eyes , For which gray worsted stocking paint supplies . Th ’ unravell 'd thread through needle 's eye convey 'd , Transferr 'd itself into his pasteboard head . How came the scissars to be thus outdone ? The needle had an eye , and they had none . O wondrous force of art ! now look at Dan — You 'll swear the pasteboard was the better man . “ The devil ! ” says he , “ the head is not so full ! ” Indeed it is — behold the paper skull . THO . SHERIDAN sculp . ON THE SAME If you say this was made for friend Dan , you belie it , I 'll swear he 's so like it that he was made by it . THO . SHERIDAN sculp .

By G —, says Dan , ‘ tis very hard , Cut out at dice , cut out at card ! G. ROCHFORT sculp . ON THE SAME PICTURE Whilst you three merry poets traffic To give us a description graphic Of Dan 's large nose in modern sapphic ; I spend my time in making sermons , Or writing libels on the Germans , Or murmuring at Whigs ’ preferments . But when I would find rhyme for Rochfort , And look in English , French , and Scotch for't , At last I 'm fairly forced to botch for't . Bid Lady Betty recollect her , And tell , who was it could direct her To draw the face of such a spectre ? I must confess , that as to me , sirs , Though I ne'er saw her hold the scissars , I now could safely swear it is hers . ‘ Tis true , no nose could come in better ; ‘ Tis a vast subject stuff 'd with matter , Which all may handle , none can flatter . Take courage , Dan ; this plainly shows , That not the wisest mortal knows What fortune may befall his nose . Show me the brightest Irish toast , Who from her lover e'er could boast Above a song or two at most : For thee three poets now are drudging all , To praise the cheeks , chin , nose , the bridge and all , Both of the picture and original . Thy nose 's length and fame extend So far , dear Dan , that every friend Tries who shall have it by the end . And future poets , as they rise , Shall read with envy and surprise Thy nose outshining Celia 's eyes . JON . SWIFT . DAN JACKSON 'S DEFENCE My verse little better you 'll find than my face is ; A word to the wise — ut pictura poesis . Three merry lads , with envy stung , Because Dan 's face is better hung , Combined in verse to rhyme it down , And in its place set up their own ; As if they 'd run it down much better By number of their feet in metre . Or that its red did cause their spite , Which made them draw in black and white . Be that as ‘ twill , this is most true , They were inspired by what they drew . Let then such critics know , my face Gives them their comeliness and grace : While every line of face does bring A line of grace to what they sing . But yet , methinks , though with disgrace Both to the picture and the face , I should name them who do rehearse The story of the picture farce ; The squire , in French as hard as stone , Or strong as rock , that 's all as one , On face on cards is very brisk , sirs , Because on them you play at whisk , sirs . But much I wonder , why my crany Should envied be by De-el-any : And yet much more , that half-namesake Should join a party in the freak . For sure I am it was not safe Thus to abuse his better half , As I shall prove you , Dan , to be , Divisim and conjunctively . For if Dan love not Sherry , can Sherry be anything to Dan ? This is the case whene'er you see Dan makes nothing of Sherry ; Or should Dan be by Sherry o'erta ' en Then Dan would be poor Sherridane ‘ Tis hard then he should be decried By Dan , with Sherry by his side . But , if the case must be so hard , That faces suffer by a card , Let critics censure , what care I ? Backbiters only we defy , Faces are free from injury . MR. ROCHFORT 'S REPLY You say your face is better hung Than ours — by what ? by nose or tongue ? In not explaining you are wrong to us , sir . Because we thus must state the case , That you have got a hanging face , Th ’ untimely end 's a damn 'd disgrace of noose , sir . But yet be not cast down : I see A weaver will your hangman be : You 'll only hang in tapestry with many ; And then the ladies , I suppose , Will praise your longitude of nose , For latent charms within your clothes , dear Danny . Thus will the fair of every age From all parts make their pilgrimage , Worship thy nose with pious rage of love , sir : All their religion will be spent About thy woven monument , And not one orison be sent to Jove , sir . You the famed idol will become , As gardens graced in ancient Rome , By matrons worshipp 'd in the gloom of night .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>O happy Dan ! thrice happy sure ! Thy fame for ever shall endure , Who after death can love secure at sight . So far I thought it was my duty To dwell upon thy boasted beauty ; Now I 'll proceed : a word or two t ’ ye in answer To that part where you carry on This paradox , that rock and stone In your opinion , are all one : How can , sir , A man of reasoning so profound So stupidly be run a-ground , As things so different to confound t'our senses ? Except you judged them by the knock Of near an equal hardy block ; Such an experimental stroke convinces . Then might you be , by dint of reason , A proper judge on this occasion ; ‘ Gainst feeling there 's no disputation , is granted : Therefore to thy superior wit , Who made the trial , we submit ; Thy head to prove the truth of it we wanted . In one assertion you 're to blame , Where Dan and Sherry 's made the same , Endeavouring to have your name refined , sir : You 'll see most grossly you mistook , If you consult your spelling-book , ( The better half you say you took ,) you 'll find , sir , S , H , E , she — and R , I , ri , Both put together make Sherry ; D , A , N , Dan — makes up the three syllables ; Dan is but one , and Sherry two , Then , sir , your choice will never do ; Therefore I 've turn 'd , my friend , on you the tables .

E . B . ] DR. DELANY 'S REPLY Assist me , my Muse , while I labour to limn him . Credite , Pisones , isti tabulae persimilem . You look and you write with so different a grace , That I envy your verse , though I did not your face . And to him that thinks rightly , there 's reason enough , ‘ Cause one is as smooth as the other is rough . But much I 'm amazed you should think my design Was to rhyme down your nose , or your harlequin grin , Which you yourself wonder the de'el should malign . And if ‘ tis so strange , that your monstership 's crany Should be envied by him , much less by Delany ; Though I own to you , when I consider it stricter , I envy the painter , although not the picture . And justly she 's envied , since a fiend of Hell Was never drawn right but by her and Raphael . Next , as to the charge , which you tell us is true , That we were inspired by the subject we drew . Inspired we were , and well , sir , you knew it ; Yet not by your nose , but the fair one that drew it ; Had your nose been the Muse , we had ne'er been inspired , Though perhaps it might justly ‘ ve been said we were fired , As to the division of words in your staves , Like my countryman 's horn-comb , into three halves , I meddle not with ‘ t , but presume to make merry , You call 'd Dan one half , and t'other half Sherry : Now if Dan 's a half , as you call't o'er and o'er , Then it can n't be denied that Sherry 's two more . For pray give me leave to say , sir , for all you , That Sherry 's at least of double the value . But perhaps , sir , you did it to fill up the verse ; So crowds in a concert ( like actors in farce ) Play two parts in one , when scrapers are scarce . But be that as ‘ twill , you 'll know more anon , sir , When Sheridan sends to merry Dan answer . SHERIDAN 'S REPLY Three merry lads you own we are ; ‘ Tis very true , and free from care : But envious we cannot bear , believe , sir : For , were all forms of beauty thine , Were you like Nereus soft and fine , We should not in the least repine , or grieve , sir . Then know from us , most beauteous Dan , That roughness best becomes a man ; ‘ Tis women should be pale , and wan , and taper ; And all your trifling beaux and fops , Who comb their brows , and sleek their chops , Are but the offspring of toy-shops , mere vapour . We know your morning hours you pass To cull and gather out a face ; Is this the way you take your glass ? Forbear it : Those loads of paint upon your toilet Will never mend your face , but spoil it , It looks as if you did parboil it : Drink claret . Your cheeks , by sleeking , are so lean , That they 're like Cynthia in the wane , Or breast of goose when ‘ tis pick 'd clean , or pullet : See what by drinking you have done : You 've made your phiz a skeleton , From the long distance of your crown , t ’ your gullet . A REJOINDER BY THE DEAN IN JACKSON 'S NAME Wearied with saying grace and prayer , I hasten 'd down to country air , To read your answer , and prepare reply to't : But your fair lines so grossly flatter , Pray do they praise me or bespatter ? I must suspect you mean the latter — Ah ! slyboot ! It must be so ! what else , alas ! Can mean by culling of a face , And all that stuff of toilet , glass , and box-comb ? But be't as ‘ twill , this you must grant , That you 're a daub , whilst I but paint ; Then which of us two is the quaint - er coxcomb ? I value not your jokes of noose , Your gibes and all your foul abuse , More than the dirt beneath my shoes , nor fear it . Yet one thing vexes me , I own , Thou sorry scarecrow of skin and bone ; To be called lean by a skeleton , who 'd bear it ? ‘ Tis true , indeed , to curry friends , You seem to praise , to make amends , And yet , before your stanza ends , you flout me , ‘ Bout latent charms beneath my clothes , For every one that knows me , knows That I have nothing like my nose about me : I pass now where you fleer and laugh , ‘ Cause I call Dan my better half ! O there you think you have me safe ! But hold , sir ; Is not a penny often found To be much greater than a pound ! By your good leave , my most profound and bold sir , Dan 's noble metal , Sherry base ; So Dan 's the better , though the less , An ounce of gold ’ s worth ten of brass , dull pedant ! As to your spelling , let me see , If SHE makes sher , and RI makes ry , Good spelling-master : your crany has lead i n't . ANOTHER REJOINDER BY THE DEAN , IN JACKSON 'S NAME Three days for answer I have waited , I thought an ace you 'd ne'er have bated And art thou forced to yield , ill-fated poetaster ?

I was born in a fen near the foot of Mount Parnassus , commonly called the Logwood Bog . My mother , whose name was Stanza , conceived me in a dream , and was delivered of me in her sleep . Her dream was , that Apollo , in the shape of a gander , with a prodigious long bill , had embraced her ; upon which she consulted the Oracle of Delphos , and the following answer was made : You 'll have a gosling , call it Dan , And do not make your goose a swan . ‘ Tis true , because the God of Wit To get him in that shape thought fit , He 'll have some glowworm sparks of it . Venture you may to turn him loose , But let it be to another goose . The time will come , the fatal time , When he shall dare a swan to rhyme ; The tow'ring swan comes sousing down , And breaks his pinions , cracks his crown . From that sad time , and sad disaster , He 'll be a lame , crack 'd poetaster . At length for stealing rhymes and triplets , He 'll be content to hang in giblets . You see now , Gentlemen , this is fatally and literally come to pass ; for it was my misfortune to engage with that Pindar of the times , Tom Sheridan , who did so confound me by sousing on my crown , and did so batter my pinions , that I was forced to make use of borrowed wings , though my false accusers have deposed that I stole my feathers from Hopkins , Sternhold , Silvester , Ogilby , Durfey , etc ., for which I now forgive them and all the world . I die a poet ; and this ladder shall be my Gradus ad Parnassum ; and I hope the critics will have mercy on my works . Then lo , I mount as slowly as I sung , And then I 'll make a line for every rung ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>There 's nine , I see ,— the Muses , too , are nine . Who would refuse to die a death like mine ! 1 . Thou first rung , Clio , celebrate my name ; 2 . Euterp , in tragic numbers do the same . 3 . This rung , I see , Terpsichore 's thy flute ; 4 .

SHERIDAN IN PERSON , WITH RESPECT , CARE , AND SPEED . TO BE DELIVERED BY AND WITH MR. SHERIDAN DEAR DAN , Here I return my trust , nor ask One penny for remittance ; If I have well perform 'd my task , Pray send me an acquittance . Too long I bore this weighty pack , As Hercules the sky ; Now take him you , Dan Atlas , back , Let me be stander-by . Not all the witty things you speak In compass of a day , Not half the puns you make a-week , Should bribe his longer stay . With me you left him out at nurse , Yet are you not my debtor ; For , as he hardly can be worse , I ne'er could make him better . He rhymes and puns , and puns and rhymes , Just as he did before ; And , when he 's lash 'd a hundred times , He rhymes and puns the more . When rods are laid on school-boys ’ bums , The more they frisk and skip : The school-boys ’ top but louder hums The more they use the whip . Thus , a lean beast beneath a load ( A beast of Irish breed ) Will , in a tedious dirty road , Outgo the prancing steed . You knock him down and down in vain , And lay him flat before ye , For soon as he gets up again , He 'll strut , and cry , Victoria ! At every stroke of mine , he fell , ‘ Tis true he roar 'd and cried ; But his impenetrable shell Could feel no harm beside . The tortoise thus , with motion slow , Will clamber up a wall ; Yet , senseless to the hardest blow , Gets nothing but a fall . Dear Dan , then , why should you , or I , Attack his pericrany ? And , since it is in vain to try , We 'll send him to Delany . POSTSCRIPT Lean Tom , when I saw him last week on his horse awry , Threaten 'd loudly to turn me to stone with his sorcery , But , I think , little Dan , that in spite of what our foe says , He will find I read Ovid and his Metamorphoses , For omitting the first ( where I make a comparison , With a sort of allusion to Putland or Harrison ) Yet , by my description , you 'll find he in short is A pack and a garran , a top and a tortoise . So I hope from henceforward you ne'er will ask , can I maul This teasing , conceited , rude , insolent animal ? And , if this rebuke might turn to his benefit , ( For I pity the man ) I should be glad then of it . SHERIDAN TO SWIFT A Highlander once fought a Frenchman at Margate , The weapons a rapier , a backsword , and target ; Brisk Monsieur advanced as fast as he could , But all his fine pushes were caught in the wood ; While Sawney with backsword did slash him and nick him , While t'other , enraged that he could not once prick him , Cried , “ Sirrah , you rascal , you son of a whore , Me 'll fight you , begar , if you 'll come from your door ! ” Our case is the same ; if you 'll fight like a man , Do n't fly from my weapon , and skulk behind Dan ; For he 's not to be pierced ; his leather 's so tough , The devil himself can n't get through his buff . Besides , I cannot but say that it is hard , Not only to make him your shield , but your vizard ; And like a tragedian , you rant and you roar , Through the horrible grin of your larva 's wide bore . Nay , farther , which makes me complain much , and frump it , You make his long nose your loud speaking-trumpet ; With the din of which tube my head you so bother , That I scarce can distinguish my right ear from t'other . You made me in your last a goose ; I lay my life o n't you are wrong , To raise me by such foul abuse ; My quill you 'll find 's a woman 's tongue ; And slit , just like a bird will chatter , And like a bird do something more ; When I let fly , ‘ twill so bespatter , I 'll change you to a black-a-moor . I 'll write while I have half an eye in my head ; I 'll write while I live , and I 'll write when you 're dead . Though you call me a goose , you pitiful slave , I 'll feed on the grass that grows on your grave .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>[ Footnote 1 ; See post , p . 351 .— W . E .

I 'm now , Sir , in a writing vein ; Do n't think , like you , I squeeze and strain , Perhaps you 'll ask me what I mean ; I will not tell , because it 's plain . Your Muse , I am told , is in the wane ; If so , from pen and ink refrain . Indeed , believe me , I 'm in pain For her and you ; your life 's a scene Of verse , and rhymes , and hurricane , Enough to crack the strongest brain . Now to conclude , I do remain , Your honest friend , TOM SHERIDAN . SWIFT TO SHERIDAN Poor Tom , wilt thou never accept a defiance , Though I dare you to more than quadruple alliance . You 're so retrograde , sure you were born under Cancer ; Must I make myself hoarse with demanding an answer ?

MARY THE COOK-MAID 'S LETTER TO DR. SHERIDAN . 1723 Well , if ever I saw such another man since my mother bound up my head ! You a gentleman ! Marry come up ! I wonder where you were bred . I 'm sure such words does not become a man of your cloth ; I would not give such language to a dog , faith and troth . Yes , you call 'd my master a knave ; fie , Mr. Sheridan ! ‘ tis a shame For a parson who should know better things , to come out with such a name . Knave in your teeth , Mr. Sheridan ! ‘ tis both a shame and a sin ; And the Dean , my master , is an honester man than you and all your kin : He has more goodness in his little finger than you have in your whole body : My master is a personable man , and not a spindle-shank hoddy doddy . And now , whereby I find you would fain make an excuse , Because my master , one day , in anger , call 'd you a goose : Which , and I am sure I have been his servant four years since October , And he never call 'd me worse than sweet-heart , drunk or sober : Not that I know his reverence was ever concern 'd to my knowledge , Though you and your come-rogues keep him out so late in your wicked college . You say you will eat grass on his grave :[ 1 ] a Christian eat grass ! Whereby you now confess yourself to be a goose or an ass : But that 's as much as to say , that my master should die before ye ; Well , well , that 's as God pleases ; and I do n't believe that 's a true story : And so say I told you so , and you may go tell my master ; what care I ? And I do n't care who knows it ; ‘ tis all one to Mary . Everybody knows that I love to tell truth , and shame the devil : I am but a poor servant ; but I think gentlefolks should be civil . Besides , you found fault with our victuals one day that you was here ; I remember it was on a Tuesday , of all days in the year . And Saunders , the man , says you are always jesting and mocking : Mary , said he , ( one day as I was mending my master 's stocking ;) My master is so fond of that minister that keeps the school — I thought my master a wise man , but that man makes him a fool . Saunders , said I , I would rather than a quart of ale He would come into our kitchen , and I would pin a dish-clout to his tail . And now I must go , and get Saunders to direct this letter ; For I write but a sad scrawl ; but my sister Marget she writes better . Well , but I must run and make the bed , before my master comes from prayers : And see now , it strikes ten , and I hear him coming up stairs ; Whereof I could say more to your verses , if I could write written hand ; And so I remain , in a civil way , your servant to ‘ command , MARY .

SPOKEN BY ONE OF THE SCHOLARS AS in a silent night a lonely swain , ‘ Tending his flocks on the Pharsalian plain , To Heaven around directs his wandering eyes , And every look finds out a new surprise ; So great 's our wonder , ladies , when we view Our lower sphere made more serene by you . O ! could such light in my dark bosom shine , What life , what vigour , should adorn each line ! Beauty and virtue should be all my theme , And Venus brighten my poetic flame . The advent'rous painter 's fate and mine are one Who fain would draw the bright meridian sun ; Majestic light his feeble art defies , And for presuming , robs him of his eyes . Then blame your power , that my inferior lays Sink far below your too exalted praise : Do n't think we flatter , your applause to gain ; No , we 're sincere ,— to flatter you were vain . You spurn at fine encomiums misapplied , And all perfections but your beauties hide . Then as you 're fair , we hope you will be kind , Nor frown on those you see so well inclined To please you most . Grant us your smiles , and then Those sweet rewards will make us act like men .

B . ] THE SONG A parody on the popular song beginning , “ My time , O ye Muses , was happily spent . ” My time , O ye Grattans , was happily spent , When Bacchus went with me , wherever I went ; For then I did nothing but sing , laugh , and jest ; Was ever a toper so merrily blest ? But now I so cross , and so peevish am grown , Because I must go to my wife back to town ; To the fondling and toying of “ honey , ” and “ dear , ” And the conjugal comforts of horrid small beer . My daughter I ever was pleased to see Come fawning and begging to ride on my knee : My wife , too , was pleased , and to the child said , Come , hold in your belly , and hold up your head : But now out of humour , I with a sour look , Cry , hussy , and give her a souse with my book ; And I 'll give her another ; for why should she play , Since my Bacchus , and glasses , and friends , are away ? Wine , what of thy delicate hue is become , That tinged our glasses with blue , like a plum ? Those bottles , those bumpers , why do they not smile , While we sit carousing and drinking the while ? Ah , bumpers , I see that our wine is all done , Our mirth falls of course , when our Bacchus is gone . Then since it is so , bring me here a supply ; Begone , froward wife , for I 'll drink till I die . A NEW YEAR 'S GIFT FOR THE DEAN OF ST. PATRICK 'S GIVEN HIM AT QUILCA . BY SHERIDAN 1723 How few can be of grandeur sure ! The high may fall , the rich be poor . The only favourite at court , To-morrow may be Fortune 's sport ; For all her pleasure and her aim Is to destroy both power and fame . Of this the Dean is an example , No instance is more plain and ample . The world did never yet produce , For courts a man of greater use . Nor has the world supplied as yet , With more vivacity and wit ; Merry alternately and wise , To please the statesman , and advise . Through all the last and glorious reign , Was nothing done without the Dean ; The courtier 's prop , the nation 's pride ; But now , alas ! he 's thrown aside ; He 's quite forgot , and so 's the queen , As if they both had never been . To see him now a mountaineer ! Oh ! what a mighty fall is here ! From settling governments and thrones , To splitting rocks , and piling stones . Instead of Bolingbroke and Anna , Shane Tunnally , and Bryan Granna , Oxford and Ormond he supplies , In every Irish Teague he spies : So far forgetting his old station , He seems to like their conversation , Conforming to the tatter 'd rabble , He learns their Irish tongue to gabble ; And , what our anger more provokes , He 's pleased with their insipid jokes ; Then turns and asks them who do lack a Good plug , or pipefull of tobacco . All cry they want , to every man He gives , extravagant , a span . Thus are they grown more fond than ever , And he is highly in their favour . Bright Stella , Quilca 's greatest pride , For them he scorns and lays aside ; And Sheridan is left alone All day , to gape , and stretch , and groan ; While grumbling , poor , complaining Dingley , Is left to care and trouble singly . All o'er the mountains spreads the rumour , Both of his bounty and good humour ; So that each shepherdess and swain Comes flocking here to see the Dean . All spread around the land , you 'd swear That every day we kept a fair . My fields are brought to such a pass , I have not left a blade of grass ; That all my wethers and my beeves Are slighted by the very thieves . At night right loath to quit the park , His work just ended by the dark , With all his pioneers he comes , To make more work for whisk and brooms . Then seated in an elbow-chair , To take a nap he does prepare ; While two fair damsels from the lawns , Lull him asleep with soft cronawns . Thus are his days in delving spent , His nights in music and content ; He seems to gain by his distress , His friends are more , his honours less . TO QUILCA A COUNTRY-HOUSE OF DR. SHERIDAN , IN NO VERY GOOD REPAIR . 1725 Let me thy properties explain : A rotten cabin , dropping rain : Chimneys , with scorn rejecting smoke ; Stools , tables , chairs , and bedsteads broke . Here elements have lost their uses , Air ripens not , nor earth produces : In vain we make poor Sheelah<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>toil , Fire will not roast , nor water boil . Through all the valleys , hills , and plains , The goddess Want , in triumph reigns ; And her chief officers of state , Sloth , Dirt , and Theft , around her wait . THE BLESSINGS OF A COUNTRY LIFE 1725 Far from our debtors ; no Dublin letters ; Not seen by our betters . THE PLAGUES OF A COUNTRY LIFE A companion with news ; a great want of shoes ; Eat lean meat or choose ; a church without pews ; Our horses away ; no straw , oats , or hay ; December in May ; our boys run away ; all servants at play .

It is not in the Dean 's hand , but seems to have been the production of Sheridan . Imprimis , there 's a table blotted , A tatter 'd hanging all bespotted . A bed of flocks , as I may rank it , Reduced to rug and half a blanket . A tinder box without a flint , An oaken desk with nothing i n't ; A pair of tongs bought from a broker , A fender and a rusty poker ; A penny pot and basin , this Design 'd for water , that for piss ; A broken-winded pair of bellows , Two knives and forks , but neither fellows . Item , a surplice , not unmeeting , Either for table-cloth , or sheeting ; There is likewise a pair of breeches , But patch 'd , and fallen in the stitches , Hung up in study very little , Plaster 'd with cobweb and spittle , An airy prospect all so pleasing , From my light window without glazing , A trencher and a College bottle , Piled up on Locke and Aristotle . A prayer-book , which he seldom handles A save-all and two farthing candles . A smutty ballad , musty libel , A Burgersdicius<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>and a Bible . The C ****[ 3 ] Seasons and the Senses By Overton , to save expenses . Item , ( if I am not much mistaken ,) A mouse-trap with a bit of bacon . A candlestick without a snuffer , Whereby his fingers often suffer .

Take those iambics which I wrote , When anger made me piping hot , And give them to your cook , To singe your fowl , or save your paste The next time when you have a feast ; They 'll save you many a book . To burn them , you are not content ; I give you then my free consent , To sink them in the harbour ; If not , they 'll serve to set off blocks , To roll on pipes , and twist in locks ; So give them to your barber . Or , when you next your physic take , I must entreat you then to make A proper application ; ‘ Tis what I 've done myself before , With Dan 's fine thoughts and many more , Who gave me provocation . What cannot mighty anger do ? It makes the weak the strong pursue , A goose attack a swan ; It makes a woman , tooth and nail , Her husband 's hands and face assail , While he 's no longer man . Though some , we find , are more discreet , Before the world are wondrous sweet , And let their husbands hector : But when the world 's asleep , they wake , That is the time they choose to speak : Witness the curtain lecture . Such was the case with you , I find : All day you could conceal your mind ; But when St. Patrick 's chimes Awaked your muse , ( my midnight curse , When I engaged for better for worse ,) You scolded with your rhymes . Have done ! have done ! I quit the field , To you as to my wife , I yield : As she must wear the breeches : So shall you wear the laurel crown , Win it and wear it , ‘ tis your own ; The poet 's only riches .

While you are trudging London town , I 'm strolling Dublin up and down ; While you converse with lords and dukes , I have their betters here , my books : Fix 'd in an elbow-chair at ease , I choose companions as I please . I 'd rather have one single shelf Than all my friends , except yourself ; For , after all that can be said , Our best acquaintance are the dead . While you 're in raptures with Faustina ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>I 'm charm 'd at home with our Sheelina . While you are starving there in state , I 'm cramming here with butchers ’ meat .

No reason then , my dear good Dean , But you should travel home again . What though you may n't in Ireland hope To find such folk as Gay and Pope ; If you with rhymers here would share But half the wit that you can spare , I 'd lay twelve eggs , that in twelve days , You 'd make a dozen of Popes and Gays . Our weather ’ s good , our sky is clear ; We 've every joy , if you were here ; So lofty and so bright a sky Was never seen by Ireland 's eye ! I think it fit to let you know , This week I shall to Quilca go ; To see M'Faden ' s horny brothers First suck , and after bull their mothers ; To see , alas ! my wither 'd trees ! To see what all the country sees ! My stunted quicks , my famish 'd beeves , My servants such a pack of thieves ; My shatter 'd firs , my blasted oaks , My house in common to all folks , No cabbage for a single snail , My turnips , carrots , parsneps , fail ; My no green peas , my few green sprouts ; My mother always in the pouts ; My horses rid , or gone astray ; My fish all stolen or run away ; My mutton lean , my pullets old , My poultry starved , the corn all sold . A man come now from Quilca says , “ They 've<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>stolen the locks from all your keys ; ” But , what must fret and vex me more , He says , “ They stole the keys before . They 've stol'n the knives from all the forks ; And half the cows from half the sturks . ” Nay more , the fellow swears and vows , “ They 've stol'n the sturks from half the cows : ” With many more accounts of woe , Yet , though the devil be there , I 'll go : ‘ Twixt you and me , the reason 's clear , Because I 've more vexation here .

I never thought A priest would please your palate ; Besides , I 'll hold a groat He 'll put you in a ballad ; Where I shall see your faces , On paper daub 'd so foul , They 'll be no more like graces , Than Venus like an owl . And we shall take you rather To be a midnight pack Of witches met together , With Beelzebub in black . It fills my heart with woe , To think such ladies fine Should be reduced so low , To treat a dull divine . Be by a parson cheated ! Had you been cunning stagers , You might yourselves be treated By captains and by majors . See how corruption grows , While mothers , daughters , aunts , Instead of powder 'd beaux , From pulpits choose gallants . If we , who wear our wigs With fantail and with snake , Are bubbled thus by prigs ; Z —— ds ! who would be a rake ? Had I a heart to fight , I 'd knock the Doctor down ; Or could I read or write , Egad ! I 'd wear a gown . Then leave him to his birch ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>And at the Rose on Sunday , The parson safe at church , I 'll treat you with burgundy .

For compliment so scurvy , I wish we had you here ; We 'd turn you topsy-turvy Into a mug of beer . You thought to make a farce on The man and place we chose ; We 're sure a single parson Is worth a hundred beaux . And you would make us vassals , Good Mr. Wig and Wings , To silver clocks and tassels ; You would , you Thing of Things ! Because around your cane A ring of diamonds is set ; And you , in some by-lane , Have gain 'd a paltry grisette ; Shall we , of sense refined , Your trifling nonsense bear , As noisy as the wind , As empty as the air ? We hate your empty prattle ; And vow and swear ‘ tis true , There 's more in one child 's rattle , Than twenty fops like you . THE BEAU 'S REPLY TO THE FIVE LADIES ’ ANSWER Why , how now , dapper black ! I smell your gown and cassock , As strong upon your back , As Tisdall<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>smells of a sock . To write such scurvy stuff ! Fine ladies never do't ; I know you well enough , And eke your cloven foot . Fine ladies , when they write , Nor scold , nor keep a splutter : Their verses give delight , As soft and sweet as butter . But Satan never saw Such haggard lines as these : They stick athwart my maw , As bad as Suffolk cheese .

SHERIDAN 'S BALLAD ON BALLY-SPELLIN .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>1728 All you that would refine your blood , As pure as famed Llewellyn , By waters clear , come every year To drink at Ballyspellin . Though pox or itch your skins enrich With rubies past the telling , ‘ Twill clear your skin before you 've been A month at Ballyspellin . If lady 's cheek be green as leek When she comes from her dwelling , The kindling rose within it glows When she 's at Ballyspellin . The sooty brown , who comes from town , Grows here as fair as Helen ; Then back she goes , to kill the beaux , By dint of Ballyspellin . Our ladies are as fresh and fair As Rose ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>or bright Dunkelling : And Mars might make a fair mistake , Were he at Ballyspellin . We men submit as they think fit , And here is no rebelling : The reason 's plain ; the ladies reign , They 're queens at Ballyspellin . By matchless charms , unconquer 'd arms , They have the way of quelling Such desperate foes as dare oppose Their power at Ballyspellin . Cold water turns to fire , and burns I know , because I fell in A stream , which came from one bright dame Who drank at Ballyspellin . Fine beaux advance , equipt for dance , To bring their Anne or Nell in , With so much grace , I 'm sure no place Can vie with Ballyspellin . No politics , no subtle tricks , No man his country selling : We eat , we drink ; we never think Of these at Ballyspellin . The troubled mind , the puff 'd with wind , Do all come here pell-mell in ; And they are sure to work their cure By drinking Ballyspellin . Though dropsy fills you to the gills , From chin to toe though swelling , Pour in , pour out , you cannot doubt A cure at Ballyspellin . Death throws no darts through all these parts , No sextons here are knelling ; Come , judge and try , you 'll never die , But live at Ballyspellin . Except you feel darts tipp 'd with steel , Which here are every belle in : When from their eyes sweet ruin flies , We die at Ballyspellin . Good cheer , sweet air , much joy , no care , Your sight , your taste , your smelling , Your ears , your touch , transported much Each day at Ballyspellin . Within this ground we all sleep sound , No noisy dogs a-yelling ; Except you wake , for Celia 's sake , All night at Ballyspellin . There all you see , both he and she , No lady keeps her cell in ; But all partake the mirth we make , Who drink at Ballyspellin . My rhymes are gone ; I think I 've none , Unless I should bring Hell in ; But , since I 'm here to Heaven so near , I can n't at Ballyspellin !

Howe'er you flounce , I here pronounce , Your medicine is repelling ; Your water 's mud , and sours the blood When drunk at Ballyspellin . Those pocky drabs , to cure their scabs , You thither are compelling , Will back be sent worse than they went , From nasty Ballyspellin . Llewellyn why ? As well may I Name honest Doctor Pellin ; So hard sometimes you tug for rhymes , To bring in Ballyspellin . No subject fit to try your wit , When you went colonelling : But dull intrigues ‘ twixt jades and teagues , You met at Ballyspellin . Our lasses fair , say what you dare , Who sowins<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>make with shelling , At Market-hill more beaux can kill , Than yours at Ballyspellin . Would I was whipt , when Sheelah stript , To wash herself our well in , A bum so white ne'er came in sight At paltry Ballyspellin . Your mawkins there smocks hempen wear ; Of Holland not an ell in , No , not a rag , whate'er your brag , Is found at Ballyspellin . But Tom will prate at any rate , All other nymphs expelling : Because he gets a few grisettes At lousy Ballyspellin . There 's bonny Jane , in yonder lane , Just o'er against the Bell inn ; Where can you meet a lass so sweet , Round all your Ballyspellin ? We have a girl deserves an earl ; She came from Enniskellin ; So fair , so young , no such among The belles of Ballyspellin . How would you stare , to see her there , The foggy mists dispelling , That cloud the brows of every blowse Who lives at Ballyspellin ! Now , as I live , I would not give A stiver or a skellin , To towse and kiss the fairest miss That leaks at Ballyspellin . Whoe'er will raise such lies as these Deserves a good cudgelling : Who falsely boasts of belles and toasts At dirty Ballyspellin . My rhymes are gone to all but one , Which is , our trees are felling ; As proper quite as those you write , To force in Ballyspellin . [ Footnote 1 : This answer , which seems to have been made while Swift was on a visit at Sir Arthur Acheson 's , “ in a mere jest and innocent merriment , ” was resented by Sheridan as an affront on the lady and himself , “ against all the rules of reason , taste , good nature , judgment , gratitude , or common manners . ” See “ The History of the Second Solomon , ” “ Prose Works , ” xi , 157 .

SIR , When I left you , I found myself of the grape 's juice sick ; I 'm so full of pity I never abuse sick ; And the patientest patient ever you knew sick ; Both when I am purge-sick , and when I am spew-sick . I pitied my cat , whom I knew by her mew sick : She mended at first , but now she 's anew sick . Captain Butler made some in the church black and blue sick . Dean Cross , had he preach 'd , would have made us all pew-sick . Are not you , in a crowd when you sweat and you stew , sick ? Lady Santry got out of the church<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>when she grew sick , And as fast as she could , to the deanery flew sick . Miss Morice was ( I can assure you ‘ tis true ) sick : For , who would not be in that numerous crew sick ? Such music would make a fanatic or Jew sick , Yet , ladies are seldom at ombre or loo sick . Nor is old Nanny Shales ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>whene'er she does brew , sick . My footman came home from the church of a bruise sick , And look 'd like a rake , who was made in the stews sick : But you learned doctors can make whom you choose sick : And poor I myself was , when I withdrew , sick : For the smell of them made me like garlic and rue sick , And I got through the crowd , though not led by a clew , sick . Yet hoped to find many ( for that was your cue ) sick ; But there was not a dozen ( to give them their due ) sick , And those , to be sure , stuck together like glue sick . So are ladies in crowds , when they squeeze and they screw , sick ; You may find they are all , by their yellow pale hue , sick ; So am I , when tobacco , like Robin , I chew , sick .

The yacht , the last storm , had all her whole crew sick ; Had we two been there , it would have made me and you sick : A lady that long 'd , is by eating of glue sick ; Did you ever know one in a very good Q sick ? I 'm told that my wife is by winding a clew sick ; The doctors have made her by rhyme<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>and by rue sick . There 's a gamester in town , for a throw that he threw sick , And yet the whole trade of his dice he 'll pursue sick ; I 've known an old miser for paying his due sick ; At present I 'm grown by a pinch of my shoe sick , And what would you have me with verses to do sick ? Send rhymes , and I 'll send you some others in lieu sick . Of rhymes I have plenty , And therefore send twenty . Answered the same day when sent , Nov. 23 .

I often tried in vain to find A simile<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>for womankind , A simile , I mean , to fit ‘ em , In every circumstance to hit ‘ em .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>Through every beast and bird I went , I ransack 'd every element ; And , after peeping through all nature , To find so whimsical a creature , A cloud<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>presented to my view , And straight this parallel I drew : Clouds turn with every wind about , They keep us in suspense and doubt , Yet , oft perverse , like womankind , Are seen to scud against the wind : And are not women just the same ? For who can tell at what they aim ?<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>Clouds keep the stoutest mortals under , When , bellowing ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>they discharge their thunder : So , when the alarum-bell is rung , Of Xanti 's<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>everlasting tongue , The husband dreads its loudness more Than lightning 's flash , or thunder 's roar . Clouds weep , as they do , without pain ; And what are tears but women 's rain ? The clouds about the welkin roam :[ 8 ] And ladies never stay at home . The clouds build castles in the air , A thing peculiar to the fair : For all the schemes of their forecasting ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>Are not more solid nor more lasting . A cloud is light by turns , and dark , Such is a lady with her spark ; Now with a sudden pouting<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>gloom She seems to darken all the room ; Again she 's pleased , his fear 's beguiled ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>And all is clear when she has smiled . In this they 're wondrously alike , ( I hope the simile will strike ,)[ 12 ] Though in the darkest dumps<span type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span>you view them , Stay but a moment , you 'll see through them . The clouds are apt to make reflection ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 14 ]</span>And frequently produce infection ; So Celia , with small provocation , Blasts every neighbour 's reputation . The clouds delight in gaudy show , ( For they , like ladies , have their bow ;) The gravest matron<span type="note_anchor">[ 15 ]</span>will confess , That she herself is fond of dress . Observe the clouds in pomp array 'd , What various colours are display 'd ; The pink , the rose , the violet 's dye , In that great drawing-room the sky ; How do these differ from our Graces ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 16 ]</span>In garden-silks , brocades , and laces ? Are they not such another sight , When met upon a birth-day night ? The clouds delight to change their fashion : ( Dear ladies , be not in a passion ! ) Nor let this whim to you seem strange , Who every hour delight in change . In them and you alike are seen The sullen symptoms of the spleen ; The moment that your vapours rise , We see them dropping from your eyes . In evening fair you may behold The clouds are fringed with borrow 'd gold ; And this is many a lady 's case , Who flaunts about in borrow 'd lace .<span type="note_anchor">[ 17 ]</span>Grave matrons are like clouds of snow , Their words fall thick , and soft , and slow ; While brisk coquettes ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 18 ]</span>like rattling hail , Our ears on every side assail . Clouds , when they intercept our sight , Deprive us of celestial light : So when my Chloe I pursue , No heaven besides I have in view . Thus , on comparison ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 19 ]</span>you see , In every instance they agree ; So like , so very much the same , That one may go by t'other ' s name . Let me proclaim<span type="note_anchor">[ 20 ]</span>it then aloud , That every woman is a cloud .

When a friend asked Socrates , how he could bear the scolding of his wife Xantippe ? he retorted , and asked him , how he could bear the gaggling of his geese ? Ay , but my geese lay eggs for me , replied his friend ; so doth my wife bear children , said Socrates .— Diog . Laert .

I could give many more instances of her termagancy , and his philosophy , if such a proceeding might not look as if I were glad of an opportunity to expose the fair sex ; but , to show that I have no such design , I declare solemnly , that I had much worse stories to tell of her behaviour to her husband , which I rather passed over , on account of the great esteem which I bear the ladies , especially those in the honourable station of matrimony . ] [ Footnote 8 : Ramble . ] [ Footnote 9 : Not vomiting . ] [ Footnote 10 : Thrusting out the lip . ] [ Footnote 11 : This is to be understood not in the sense of wort , when brewers put yeast or harm in it ; but its true meaning is , deceived or cheated . ] [ Footnote 12 : Hit your fancy . ] [ Footnote 13 : Sullen fits .

Written by DERMOT O'NEPHELY , Chief Cape of Howth .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>BY DR . SWIFT ADVERTISEMENT FROM THE CLOUDS N. B . The following answer to that scurrilous libel against us , should have been published long ago in our own justification : But it was advised , that , considering the high importance of the subject , it should be deferred until the meeting of the General Assembly of the Nation . [ Two passages within crotchets are added to this poem , from a copy found amongst Swift 's papers . It is indorsed , “ Quære , should it go . ” And a little lower , “ More , but of no use . ” ] Presumptuous bard ! how could you dare A woman with a cloud compare ? Strange pride and insolence you show Inferior mortals there below . And is our thunder in your ears So frequent or so loud as theirs ? Alas ! our thunder soon goes out ; And only makes you more devout . Then is not female clatter worse , That drives you not to pray , but curse ? We hardly thunder thrice a-year ; The bolt discharged , the sky grows clear ; But every sublunary dowdy , The more she scolds , the more she 's cloudy . [ How useful were a woman 's thunder , If she , like us , would burst asunder ! Yet , though her stays hath often cursed her , And , whisp'ring , wish 'd the devil burst her : For hourly thund'ring in his face , She ne'er was known to burst a lace . ] Some critic may object , perhaps , That clouds are blamed for giving claps ; But what , alas ! are claps ethereal , Compared for mischief to venereal ? Can clouds give buboes , ulcers , blotches , Or from your noses dig out notches ? We leave the body sweet and sound ; We kill , ‘ tis true , but never wound . You know a cloudy sky bespeaks Fair weather when the morning breaks ; But women in a cloudy plight , Foretell a storm to last till night . A cloud in proper season pours His blessings down in fruitful showers ; But woman was by fate design 'd To pour down curses on mankind . When Sirius<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>o'er the welkin rages , Our kindly help his fire assuages ; But woman is a cursed inflamer , No parish ducking-stool can tame her : To kindle strife , dame Nature taught her ; Like fireworks , she can burn in water . For fickleness how durst you blame us , Who for our constancy are famous ? You 'll see a cloud in gentle weather Keep the same face an hour together ; While women , if it could be reckon 'd , Change every feature every second . Observe our figure in a morning , Of foul or fair we give you warning ; But can you guess from women 's air One minute , whether foul or fair ? Go read in ancient books enroll 'd What honours we possess 'd of old . To disappoint Ixion 's<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>rape Jove dress 'd a cloud in Juno 's shape ; Which when he had enjoy 'd , he swore , No goddess could have pleased him more ; No difference could he find between His cloud and Jove 's imperial queen ; His cloud produced a race of Centaurs , Famed for a thousand bold adventures ; From us descended ab origine , By learned authors , called nubigenae ; But say , what earthly nymph do you know , So beautiful to pass for Juno ? Before Æneas durst aspire To court her majesty of Tyre , His mother begg 'd of us to dress him , That Dido might the more caress him : A coat we gave him , dyed in grain , A flaxen wig , and clouded cane , ( The wig was powder 'd round with sleet , Which fell in clouds beneath his feet ) With which he made a tearing show ; And Dido quickly smoked the beau . Among your females make inquiries , What nymph on earth so fair as Iris ? With heavenly beauty so endow 'd ? And yet her father is a cloud . We dress 'd her in a gold brocade , Befitting Juno 's favourite maid . ‘ Tis known that Socrates the wise Adored us clouds as deities : To us he made his daily prayers , As Aristophanes declares ; From Jupiter took all dominion , And died defending his opinion . By his authority ‘ tis plain You worship other gods in vain ; And from your own experience know We govern all things there below . You follow where we please to guide ; O'er all your passions we preside , Can raise them up , or sink them down , As we think fit to smile or frown : And , just as we dispose your brain , Are witty , dull , rejoice , complain . Compare us then to female race ! We , to whom all the gods give place ! Who better challenge your allegiance Because we dwell in higher regions . You find the gods in Homer dwell In seas and streams , or low as Hell : Ev'n Jove , and Mercury his pimp , No higher climb than mount Olymp . Who makes you think the clouds he pierces ? He pierce the clouds ! he kiss their a — es ; While we , o'er Teneriffa placed , Are loftier by a mile at least : And , when Apollo struts on Pindus , We see him from our kitchen windows ; Or , to Parnassus looking down , Can piss upon his laurel crown . Fate never form 'd the gods to fly ; In vehicles they mount the sky : When Jove would some fair nymph inveigle , He comes full gallop on his eagle ; Though Venus be as light as air , She must have doves to draw her chair ; Apollo stirs not out of door , Without his lacquer 'd coach and four ; And jealous Juno , ever snarling , Is drawn by peacocks in her berlin : But we can fly where'er we please , O'er cities , rivers , hills , and seas : From east to west the world we roam , And in all climates are at home ; With care provide you as we go With sunshine , rain , and hail , or snow . You , when it rains , like fools , believe Jove pisses on you through a sieve : An idle tale , ‘ tis no such matter ; We only dip a sponge in water , Then squeeze it close between our thumbs , And shake it well , and down it comes ; As you shall to your sorrow know ; We 'll watch your steps where'er you go ; And , since we find you walk a-foot , We 'll soundly souse your frieze surtout . ‘ Tis but by our peculiar grace , That Phoebus ever shows his face ; For , when we please , we open wide Our curtains blue from side to side ; And then how saucily he shows His brazen face and fiery nose ; And gives himself a haughty air , As if he made the weather fair ! ‘ Tis sung , wherever Celia treads , The violets ope their purple heads ; The roses blow , the cowslip springs ; ‘ Tis sung ; but we know better things . ‘ Tis true , a woman on her mettle Will often piss upon a nettle ; But though we own she makes it wetter , The nettle never thrives the better ; While we , by soft prolific showers , Can every spring produce you flowers . Your poets , Chloe 's beauty height'ning , Compare her radiant eyes to lightning ; And yet I hope ‘ twill be allow 'd , That lightning comes but from a cloud . But gods like us have too much sense At poets ’ flights to take offence ; Nor can hyperboles demean us ; Each drab has been compared to Venus . We own your verses are melodious ; But such comparisons are odious . [ Observe the case — I state it thus : Though you compare your trull to us , But think how damnably you err When you compare us clouds to her ; From whence you draw such bold conclusions ; But poets love profuse allusions . And , if you now so little spare us , Who knows how soon you may compare us To Chartres , Walpole , or a king , If once we let you have your swing . Such wicked insolence appears Offensive to all pious ears . To flatter women by a metaphor ! What profit could you hope to get of her ? And , for her sake , turn base detractor Against your greatest benefactor . But we shall keep revenge in store If ever you provoke us more : For , since we know you walk a-foot , We 'll soundly drench your frieze surtout ; Or may we never thunder throw , Nor souse to death a birth-day beau . We own your verses are melodious ; But such comparisons are odious . ] [ Footnote 1 : The highest point of Howth is called the Cape of Howth .— F .] [ Footnote 2 : The Dogstar .— Hyginus , “ Astronomica . ” ] [ Footnote 3 : Who murdered his father-in-law , and was taken into heaven and purified by Jove , but when , after he had begot the Centaurs from the cloud , he boasted of his imaginary success with Juno , Jupiter hurled him into Tartarus , where he was bound to a perpetually revolving wheel . “ Volvitur Ixion : et se sequiturque fugitque . ” Ovid , “ Metam ., ” iv , 460 .

D . written with a design to be spoken by her on his arrival at Glassnevin , Dr. Delany having complimented him with a house there . From the London and Dublin Magazine for June , 1735 . The lines are probably by Delany or Sheridan . Though the name of this place may make you to frown , Your Deanship is welcome to Glassnevin town ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>A glass and no wine , to a man of your taste , Alas ! is enough , sir , to break it in haste ; Be that as it will , your presence can n't fail To yield great delight in drinking our ale ; Would you but vouchsafe a mug to partake , And as we can brew , believe we can bake . The life and the pleasure we now from you hope , The famed Violante can n't show on the rope ; Your genius and talents outdo even Pope . Then while , sir , you live at Glassnevin , and find The benefit wish 'd you , by friends who are kind ; One night in the week , sir , your favour bestow , To drink with Delany and others your know : They constantly meet at Peg Radcliffe 's together , Talk over the news of the town and the weather ; Reflect on mishaps in church and in state , Digest many things as well as good meat ; And club each alike that no one may treat . This if you will grant without coach or chair , You may , in a trice , cross the way and be there ; For Peg is your neighbour , as well as Delany , A housewifely woman full pleasing to any . [ Footnote 1 : A pun on Glassnevin — Glass — ne , no , and vin , wine .— Scott . ] VERSES BY SHERIDAN When to my house you come , dear Dean , Your humble friend to entertain , Through dirt and mire along the street , You find no scraper for your feet ; At which you stamp and storm and swell , Which serves to clean your feet as well . By steps ascending to the hall , All torn to rags by boys and ball , With scatter 'd fragments on the floor ; A sad , uneasy parlour door , Besmear 'd with chalk , and carved with knives , ( A plague upon all careless wives ,) Are the next sights you must expect , But do not think they are my neglect . Ah that these evils were the worst ! The parlour still is farther curst . To enter there if you advance , If in you get , it is by chance . How oft by turns have you and I Said thus — “ Let me — no — let me try — This turn will open it , I 'll engage ” — You push me from it in a rage . Turning , twisting , forcing , fumbling , Stamping , staring , fuming , grumbling , At length it opens — in we go — How glad are we to find it so ! Conquests through pains and dangers please , Much more than those attain 'd with ease . Are you disposed to take a seat ; The instant that it feels your weight , Out goes its legs , and down you come Upon your reverend deanship 's bum . Betwixt two stools , ‘ tis often said , The sitter on the ground is laid ; What praise then to my chairs is due , Where one performs the feat of two ! Now to the fire , if such there be , At present nought but smoke we see . “ Come , stir it up ! ” — “ Ho , Mr. Joker , How can I stir it without a poker ? ” “ The bellows take , their batter 'd nose Will serve for poker , I suppose . ” Now you begin to rake — alack The grate has tumbled from its back — The coals all on the hearth are laid — “ Stay , sir — I 'll run and call the maid ; She 'll make the fire again complete — She knows the humour of the grate . ” “ Pox take your maid and you together — This is cold comfort in cold weather . ” Now all is right again — the blaze Suddenly raised as soon decays . Once more apply the bellows — “ So — These bellows were not made to blow — Their leathern lungs are in decay , They can n't even puff the smoke away . ” “ And is your reverence vext at that , Get up , in God 's name , take your hat ; Hang them , say I , that have no shift ; Come blow the fire , good Doctor Swift . If trifles such as these can tease you , Plague take those fools that strive to please you . Therefore no longer be a quarrel'r Either with me , sir , or my parlour . If you can relish ought of mine , A bit of meat , a glass of wine , You 're welcome to it , and you shall fare As well as dining with the mayor . ” “ You saucy scab — you tell me so ! Why , booby-face , I 'd have you know I 'd rather see your things in order , Than dine in state with the recorder . For water I must keep a clutter , Or chide your wife for stinking butter ; Or getting such a deal of meat As if you 'd half the town to eat . That wife of yours , the devil 's in her , I 've told her of this way of dinner Five hundred times , but all in vain — Here comes a rump of beef again : O that that wife of yours would burst — Get out , and serve the boarders first . Pox take ‘ em all for me — I fret So much , I shall not eat my meat — You know I 'd rather have a slice . ” “ I know , dear sir , you are not nice ; You 'll have your dinner in a minute , Here comes the plate and slices in it — Therefore no more , but take your place — Do you fall to , and I 'll say grace . ” VERSES ADDRESSED TO SWIFT AND TO HIS MEMORY TO DR . SWIFT ON HIS BIRTH-DAY<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>While I the godlike men of old , In admiration wrapt , behold ; Revered antiquity explore , And turn the long-lived volumes o'er ; Where Cato , Plutarch , Flaccus , shine In every excellence divine ; I grieve that our degenerate days Produce no mighty soul like these : Patriot , philosopher , and bard , Are names unknown , and seldom heard . “ Spare your reflection , ” Phoebus cries ; “ ‘ Tis as ungrateful as unwise : Can you complain , this sacred day , That virtues or that arts decay ? Behold , in Swift revived appears : The virtues of unnumber 'd years ; Behold in him , with new delight , The patriot , bard , and sage unite ; And know , Iërne in that name Shall rival Greece and Rome in fame . ” [ Footnote 1 : Written by Mrs. Pilkington , at the time when she wished to be introduced to the Dean . The verses being presented to him by Dr. Delany , he kindly accepted the compliment .— Scott . ] ON DR . SWIFT 1733 No pedant Bentley proud , uncouth , Nor sweetening dedicator smooth , In one attempt has ever dared To sap , or storm , this mighty bard , Nor Envy does , nor ignorance , Make on his works the least advance . For this , behold ! still flies afar Where'er his genius does appear ; Nor has that aught to do above , So meddles not with Swift and Jove . A faithful , universal fame In glory spreads abroad his name ; Pronounces Swift , with loudest breath , Immortal grown before his death . TO THE REV . DR . SWIFT , DEAN OF ST. PATRICK 'S A BIRTH-DAY POEM . NOV. 30 , 1736 To you , my true and faithful friend , These tributary lines I send , Which every year , thou best of deans , I 'll pay as long as life remains ; But did you know one half the pain What work , what racking of the brain , It costs me for a single clause , How long I 'm forced to think and pause ; How long I dwell upon a proem , To introduce your birth-day poem , How many blotted lines ; I know it , You 'd have compassion for the poet . Now , to describe the way I think , I take in hand my pen and ink ; I rub my forehead , scratch my head , Revolving all the rhymes I read . Each complimental thought sublime , Reduced by favourite Pope to rhyme , And those by you to Oxford writ , With true simplicity and wit . Yet after all I cannot find One panegyric to my mind . Now I begin to fret and blot , Something I schemed , but quite forgot ; My fancy turns a thousand ways , Through all the several forms of praise , What eulogy may best become The greatest dean in Christendom . At last I 've hit upon a thought —— Sure this will do —— ‘ tis good for nought —— This line I peevishly erase , And choose another in its place ; Again I try , again commence , But cannot well express the sense ; The line 's too short to hold my meaning : I 'm cramp 'd , and cannot bring the Dean in . O for a rhyme to glorious birth ! I 've hit upo n't —— The rhyme is earth —— But how to bring it in , or fit it , I know not , so I 'm forced to quit it . Again I try — I 'll sing the man — Ay do , says Phoebus , if you can ; I wish with all my heart you would not ; Were Horace now alive he could not : And will you venture to pursue , What none alive or dead could do ? Pray see , did ever Pope or Gay Presume to write on his birth-day ; Though both were fav'rite bards of mine , The task they wisely both decline . With grief I felt his admonition , And much lamented my condition : Because I could not be content Without some grateful compliment , If not the poet , sure the friend Must something on your birth-day send . I scratch 'd , and rubb 'd my head once more : “ Let every patriot him adore . ” Alack-a-day , there 's nothing i n't — Such stuff will never do in print . Pray , reader , ponder well the sequel ; I hope this epigram will take well . In others , life is deem 'd a vapour , In Swift it is a lasting taper , Whose blaze continually refines , The more it burns the more it shines . I read this epigram again , ‘ Tis much too flat to fit the Dean . Then down I lay some scheme to dream on Assisted by some friendly demon . I slept , and dream 'd that I should meet A birth-day poem in the street ; So , after all my care and rout , You see , dear Dean , my dream is out . EPIGRAMS OCCASIONED BY DR . SWIFT 'S INTENDED HOSPITAL FOR IDIOTS AND LUNATICS I The Dean must die — our idiots to maintain ! Perish , ye idiots ! and long live the Dean ! II O Genius of Hibernia 's state , Sublimely good , severely great , How doth this latest act excel All you have done or wrote so well ! Satire may be the child of spite , And fame might bid the Drapier write : But to relieve , and to endow , Creatures that know not whence or how Argues a soul both good and wise , Resembling Him who rules the skies , He to the thoughtful mind displays Immortal skill ten thousand ways ; And , to complete his glorious task , Gives what we have not sense to ask ! III Lo ! Swift to idiots bequeaths his store : Be wise , ye rich !— consider thus the poor ! IV Great wits to madness nearly are allied , This makes the Dean for kindred thus provide . ON THE DEAN OF ST. PATRICK 'S BIRTH-DAY BEING NOV. 30 , ST. ANDREW 'S DAY Between the hours of twelve and one , When half the world to rest were gone , Entranced in softest sleep I lay , Forgetful of an anxious day ; From every care and labour free , My soul as calm as it could be . The queen of dreams , well pleased to find An undisturb 'd and vacant mind , With magic pencil traced my brain , And there she drew St. Patrick 's Dean : I straight beheld on either hand Two saints , like guardian angels , stand , And either claim 'd him for their son , And thus the high dispute begun : St. Andrew , first , with reason strong , Maintain 'd to him he did belong . “ Swift is my own , by right divine , All born upon this day are mine . ” St. Patrick said , “ I own this true So far he does belong to you : But in my church he 's born again , My son adopted , and my Dean . When first the Christian truth I spread , The poor within this isle I fed , And darkest errors banish 'd hence , Made knowledge in their place commence : Nay more , at my divine command , All noxious creatures fled the land . I made both peace and plenty smile , Hibernia was my favourite isle ; Now his — for he succeeds to me , Two angels cannot more agree . His joy is , to relieve the poor ; Behold them weekly at his door ! His knowledge too , in brightest rays , He like the sun to all conveys , Shows wisdom in a single page , And in one hour instructs an age When ruin lately stood around Th'enclosures of my sacred ground , He gloriously did interpose , And saved it from invading foes ; For this I claim immortal Swift As my own son , and Heaven 's best gift . The Caledonian saint , enraged , Now closer in dispute engaged . Essays to prove , by transmigration , The Dean is of the Scottish nation ; And , to confirm the truth , he chose The loyal soul of great Montrose ; “ Montrose and he are both the same , They only differ in the name : Both heroes in a righteous cause , Assert their liberties and laws ; He 's now the same Montrose was then , But that the sword is turn 'd a pen , A pen of so great power , each word Defends beyond the hero 's sword . ” Now words grew high — we can n't suppose Immortals ever come to blows , But lest unruly passion should Degrade them into flesh and blood , An angel quick from Heaven descends , And he at once the contest ends : “ Ye reverend pair , from discord cease , Ye both mistake the present case ; One kingdom cannot have pretence To so much virtue ! so much sense ! Search Heaven 's record ; and there you 'll find That he was born for all mankind . ” AN EPISTLE TO ROBERT NUGENT , ESQ .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>WITH A PICTURE OF DR . SWIFT . BY WILLIAM DUNKIN , D. D . To gratify thy long desire , ( So love and piety require ,) From Bindon 's colours you may trace The patriot 's venerable face . The last , O Nugent ! which his art Shall ever to the world impart ; For know , the prime of mortal men , That matchless monarch of the pen , ( Whose labours , like the genial sun , Shall through revolving ages run , Yet never , like the sun , decline , But in their full meridian shine ,) That ever honour 'd , envied sage , So long the wonder of the age , Who charm 'd us with his golden strain , Is not the shadow of the Dean : He only breathes Boeotian air — “ O ! what a falling off was there ! ” Hibernia 's Helicon is dry , Invention , Wit , and Humour die ; And what remains against the storm Of Malice but an empty form ? The nodding ruins of a pile , That stood the bulwark of this isle ? In which the sisterhood was fix 'd Of candid Honour , Truth unmix 'd , Imperial Reason , Thought profound , And Charity , diffusing round In cheerful rivulets to flow Of Fortune to the sons of woe ? Such one , my Nugent , was thy Swift , Endued with each exalted gift , But lo ! the pure ethereal flame Is darken 'd by a misty steam : The balm exhausted breathes no smell , The rose is wither 'd ere it fell . That godlike supplement of law , Which held the wicked world in awe And could the tide of faction stem , Is but a shell without the gem . Ye sons of genius , who would aim To build an everlasting fame , And in the field of letter 'd arts , Display the trophies of your parts , To yonder mansion turn aside , And mortify your growing pride . Behold the brightest of the race , And Nature 's honour , in disgrace : With humble resignation own , That all your talents are a loan ; By Providence advanced for use , Which you should study to produce Reflect , the mental stock , alas ! However current now it pass , May haply be recall 'd from you Before the grave demands his due , Then , while your morning star proceeds , Direct your course to worthy deeds , In fuller day discharge your debts ; For , when your sun of reason sets , The night succeeds ; and all your schemes Of glory vanish with your dreams . Ah ! where is now the supple train , That danced attendance on the Dean ? Say , where are those facetious folks , Who shook with laughter at his jokes , And with attentive rapture hung , On wisdom , dropping from his tongue ; Who look 'd with high disdainful pride On all the busy world beside , And rated his productions more Than treasures of Peruvian ore ? Good Christians ! they with bended knees Ingulf 'd the wine , but loathe the lees , Averting , ( so the text commands ,) With ardent eyes and upcast hands , The cup of sorrow from their lips , And fly , like rats , from sinking ships . While some , who by his friendship rose To wealth , in concert with his foes Run counter to their former track , Like old Actæon 's horrid pack Of yelling mongrels , in requitals To riot on their master 's vitals ; And , where they cannot blast his laurels , Attempt to stigmatize his morals ; Through Scandal 's magnifying glass His foibles view , but virtues pass , And on the ruins of his fame Erect an ignominious name . So vermin foul , of vile extraction , The spawn of dirt and putrefaction , The sounder members traverse o'er , But fix and fatten on a sore . Hence ! peace , ye wretches , who revile His wit , his humour , and his style ; Since all the monsters which he drew Were only meant to copy you ; And , if the colours be not fainter , Arraign yourselves , and not the painter . But , O ! that He , who gave him breath , Dread arbiter of life and death : That He , the moving soul of all , The sleeping spirit would recall , And crown him with triumphant meeds , For all his past heroic deeds , In mansions of unbroken rest , The bright republic of the bless 'd ! Irradiate his benighted mind With living light of light refined ; And there the blank of thought employ With objects of immortal joy ! Yet , while he drags the sad remains Of life , slow-creeping through his veins , Above the views of private ends , The tributary Muse attends , To prop his feeble steps , or shed The pious tear around his bed . So pilgrims , with devout complaints , Frequent the graves of martyr 'd saints , Inscribe their worth in artless lines , And , in their stead , embrace their shrines . [ Footnote 1 : Created Baron Nugent and Viscount Clare , Dec. 20 , 1766 .— Scott . ] ON THE DRAPIER . BY DR. DUNKIN .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Undone by fools at home , abroad by knaves , The isle of saints became the land of slaves , Trembling beneath her proud oppressor 's hand ; But , when thy reason thunder 'd through the land , Then all the public spirit breathed in thee , And all , except the sons of guilt , were free . Blest isle , blest patriot , ever glorious strife ! You gave her freedom , as she gave you life ! Thus Cato fought , whom Brutus copied well , And with those rights for which you stand , he fell . [ Footnote 1 : See the translation of Carberiae Rupes in vol . i , p. 143 . In the select Poetical Works of Dr. Dunkin , published at Dublin in 1770 , are four well-chosen compliments to the Dean on his birth-day , and a very humorous poetical advertisement for a copy of Virgil Travestie , which , at the Dean 's request , Dr. Dunkin had much corrected , and afterwards lost . After offering a small reward to whoever will restore it , he adds , “ Or if , when this book shall be offer 'd to sale , Any printer will stop it , the bard will not fail To make over the issues and profits accruing From thence to the printer , for his care in so doing ; Provided he first to the poet will send it , That where it is wrong , he may alter and mend it . ” — N .] EPITAPH PROPOSED FOR DR .

Pride of our isles , and boast of human race ! Great sage ! great bard ! supreme in knowledge born ! The world to mend , enlighten , and adorn . Truth on Cimmerian darkness pours the day ! Wit drives in smiles the gloom of minds away ! Ye kindred suns on high , ye glorious spheres , Whom have ye seen , in twice three thousand years , Whom have ye seen , like these , of mortal birth ; Though Archimede and Horace blest the earth ? Barbarians , from th ’ Equator to the Poles , Hark ! reason calls ! wisdom awakes your souls ! Ye regions , ignorant of Walpole 's name ; Ye climes , where kings shall ne'er extend their fame ; Where men , miscall 'd , God 's image have defaced , Their form belied , and human shape disgraced ! Ye two-legg 'd wolves ! slaves ! superstition 's sons ! Lords ! soldiers ! holy Vandals ! modern Huns ! Boors , mufties , monks ; in Russia , Turkey , Spain ! Who does not know SIR ISAAC , and THE DEAN ? TO THE MEMORY OF DOCTOR SWIFT When wasteful death has closed the Poet 's eyes , And low in earth his mortal essence lies ; When the bright flame , that once his breast inspired , Has to its first , its noblest seat retired ; All worthy minds , whom love of merit sways , Should shade from slander his respected bays ; And bid that fame , his useful labours won , Pure and untainted through all ages run . Envy 's a fiend all excellence pursues , But mostly poets favour 'd by the Muse ; Who wins the laurel , sacred verse bestows , Makes all , who fail in like attempts , his foes ; No puny wit of malice can complain , The thorn is theirs , who most applauses gain . Whatever gifts or graces Heaven design 'd To raise man 's genius , or enrich his mind , Were Swift 's to boast — alike his merits claim The statesman 's knowledge , and the poet 's flame ; The patriot 's honour , zealous to defend His country 's rights — and faithful to the end ; The sound divine , whose charities display 'd He more by virtue than by forms was sway 'd ; Temperate at board , and frugal of his store , Which he but spared , to make his bounties more : The generous friend , whose heart alike caress 'd , The friend triumphant , or the friend distress 'd ; Who could , unpain 'd , another 's merit spy , Nor view a rival 's fame with jaundiced eye ; Humane to all , his love was unconfined , And in its scope embraced all human kind ; Sharp , not malicious , was his charming wit , And less to anger than reform he writ ; Whatever rancour his productions show 'd , From scorn of vice and folly only flow 'd ; He thought that fools were an invidious race , And held no measures with the vain or base . Virtue so clear ! who labours to destroy , Shall find the charge can but himself annoy : The slanderous theft to his own breast recoils , Who seeks renown from injured merit 's spoils ; All hearts unite , and Heaven with man conspires To guard those virtues she herself admires . O sacred bard !— once ours !— but now no more , Whose loss , for ever , Ireland must deplore , No earthly laurels needs thy happy brow , Above the poet 's are thy honours now : Above the patriot 's , ( though a greater name No temporal monarch for his crown can claim . ) From noble breasts if envy might ensue , Thy death is all the brave can envy you . You died , when merit ( to its fate resign 'd ) Saw scarce one friend to genius left behind , When shining parts did jealous hatred breed , And ‘ twas a crime in science to succeed , When ignorance spread her hateful mist around , And dunces only an acceptance found . What could such scenes in noble minds beget , But life with pain , and talents with regret ? Add that thy spirit from the world retired , Ere hidden foes its further grief conspired ; No treacherous friend did stories yet contrive , To blast the Muse he flatter 'd when alive ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Or sordid printer ( by his influence led ) Abused the fame that first bestow 'd him bread . Slanders so mean , had he whose nicer ear Abhorr 'd all scandal , but survived to hear , The fraudful tale had stronger scorn supplied , And he ( at length ) with more disdain had died , But since detraction is the portion here Of all who virtuous durst , or great , appear , And the free soul no true existence gains , While earthly particles its flight restrains , The greatest favour grimful Death can show , Is with swift dart to expedite the blow . So thought the Dean , who , anxious for his fate , Sigh 'd for release , and deem 'd the blessing late . And sure if virtuous souls ( life 's travail past ) Enjoy ( as churchmen teach ) repose at last , There 's cause to think , a mind so firmly good , Who vice so long , and lawless power , withstood , Has reach 'd the limits of that peaceful shore , Where knaves molest , and tyrants awe , no more ; These blissful seats the pious but attain , Where incorrupt , immortal spirits reign . There his own Parnell strikes the living lyre . And Pope , harmonius , joins the tuneful choir ; His Stella too , ( no more to forms confined , For heavenly beings all are of a kind ,) Unites with his the treasures of her mind , With warmer friendships bids their bosoms glow , Nor dreads the rage of vulgar tongues below . Such pleasing hope the tranquil breast enjoys , Whose inward peace no conscious crime annoys ; While guilty minds irresolute appear , And doubt a state their vices needs must fear . R —— T B —— N. Dublin , Nov. 4 , 1755 .

The next line refers to Faulkner .— W . E . B . ] A SCHOOLBOY 'S THEME The following lines were enclosed in a letter from Mr. Pulteney , ( afterwards Earl of Bath ,) to Swift , in which he says — “ You must give me leave to add to my letter a copy of verses at the end of a declamation made by a boy at Westminster school on this theme ,— Ridentem dicere verum quid vetat ? ” Dulce , Decane , decus , flos optime gentis Hibernae Nomine quique audis , ingenioque celer : Dum lepido indulges risu , et mutaris in horas , Quò nova vis animi , materiesque rapit ? Nunc gravis astrologus , coelo dominaris et astris , Filaque pro libitu Partrigiana secas . Nunc populo speciosa hospes miracula promis , Gentesque aequoreas , aëriasque creas . Seu plausum captat queruli persona Draperi , Seu levis a vacuo tabula sumpta cado . Mores egregius mira exprimis arte magister , Et vitam atque homines pagina quaeque sapit ; Socraticae minor est vis et sapientia chartae , Nec tantum potuit grande Platonis opus . VERSES ON THE BATTLE OF THE BOOKS BY MR. JAMES STERLING , OF THE COUNTY OF MEATH While the Dean with more wit than man ever wanted , Or than Heaven to any man else ever granted , Endeavours to prove , how the ancients in knowledge Have excell 'd our adepts of each modern college ; How by heroes of old our chiefs are surpass 'd In each useful science , true learning , and taste . While thus he behaves , with more courage than manners , And fights for the foe , deserting our banners ; While Bentley and Wotton , our champions , he foils , And wants neither Temple 's assistance , nor Boyle 's ; In spite of his learning , fine reasons , and style , — Would you think it ?— he favours our cause all the while : We raise by his conquest our glory the higher , And from our defeat to a triumph aspire ; Our great brother-modern , the boast of our days , Unconscious , has gain 'd for our party the bays : St. James 's old authors , so famed on each shelf , Are vanquish 'd by what he has written himself . ON DR . SWIFT 'S LEAVING HIS ESTATE TO IDIOTS Swift , wondrous genius , bright intelligence , Pities the orphan 's , idiot 's want of sense ; And rich in supernumerary pelf , Adopts posterity unlike himself . To one great individual wit 's confined ! Such eunuchs never propagate their kind . Thus nature 's prodigies bestow the gifts Of fortune , their descendants are no Swifts . When did prime statesman , for a sceptre fit His ministerial successor beget ? No age , no state , no world , can hope to see Two SWIFTS or WALPOLES in one family . ON SEVERAL PETTY PIECES LATELY PUBLISHED AGAINST DEAN SWIFT , NOW DEAF AND INFIRM Thy mortal part , ingenious Swift ! must die , Thy fame shall reach beyond mortality ! How puny whirlings joy at thy decline , Thou darling offspring of the tuneful nine ! The noble lion thus , as vigour passes , The fable tells us , is abused by asses . ON FAULKNER 'S EDITION OF SWIFT Ornamented with an Engraving of the Dean , by Vertue . In a little dark room at the back of his shop , Where poets and scribes have dined on a chop , Poor Faulkner sate musing alone thus of late , “ Two volumes are done — it is time for the plate ; Yes , time to be sure ;— but on whom shall I call To express the great Swift in a compass so small ? Faith , Vertue shall do it , I 'm pleased at the thought , Be the cost what it will — the copper is bought . ” Apollo o'erheard , ( who as some people guess , Had a hand in the work , and corrected the press ;) And pleased , he replied , “ Honest George , you are right , The thought was my own , howsoe'er you came by't . For though both the wit and the style is my gift , ‘ Tis VERTUE alone can design us a SWIFT . ” EPIGRAM ON LORD ORRERY 'S REMARKS ON SWIFT 'S LIFE AND WRITINGS A sore disease this scribbling itch is ! His Lordship , in his Pliny seen ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Turns Madam Pilkington in breeches , And now attacks our Patriot Dean . What ! libel his friend when laid in ground : Nay , good sir , you may spare your hints , His parallel at last is found , For what he writes George Faulkner prints . Had Swift provoked to this behaviour , Yet after death resentment cools , Sure his last act bespoke his favour , He built an hospital — for fools . [ Footnote 1 : Lord Orrery translated the letters of the younger Pliny .— Scott . ] TO DOCTOR DELANY ON HIS BOOK ENTITLED “ OBSERVATIONS ON LORD ORRERY 'S REMARKS ” Delany , to escape your friend the Dean , And prove all false that Orrery had writ , You kindly own his Gulliver profane , Yet make his puns and riddles sterling wit . But if for wrongs to Swift you would atone , And please the world , one way you may succeed , Collect Boyle 's writings and your own , And serve them as you served THE DEED . EPIGRAM On Faulkner 's displaying in his shop the Dean 's bust in marble , ( now placed in the great aisle of St. Patrick 's church ) , while he was publishing Lord Orrery 's Remarks . Faulkner ! for once you have some judgment shown , By representing Swift transform 'd to stone ; For could he thy ingratitude have known , Astonishment itself the work had done ! AN INSCRIPTION Intended for a compartment in Dr . Swift 's monument , designed by Cunningham , on College Green , Dublin . Say , to the Drapier 's vast unbounded fame , What added honours can the sculptor give ? None .— ‘ Tis a sanction from the Drapier 's name Must bid the sculptor and his marble live . June 4 , 1765 . AN EPIGRAM OCCASIONED BY THE ABOVE INSCRIPTION Which gave the Drapier birth two realms contend ; And each asserts her poet , patriot , friend : Her mitre jealous Britain may deny ; That loss Iërne 's laurel shall supply ; Through life 's low vale , she , grateful , gave him bread ; Her vocal stones shall vindicate him dead .
