THE LIFE OF SAMUEL JOHNSON . We feel considerable trepidation in beginning a life of Johnson , not so much on account of the magnitude of the man — for in Milton , and one or two others , we have already met his match — but on account of the fact that the field has been so thoroughly exhausted by former writers . It is in the shadow of Boswell , the best of all biographers , and not in that of Johnson , that we feel ourselves at present cowering . Yet we must try to give a rapid account of the leading incidents in Johnson 's life , as well as a short estimate of his vast , rugged genius . Samuel Johnson was born at Lichfield , Staffordshire , on the 18th of September 1709 , and was baptized the same day . His father was Michael Johnson , a bookseller and stationer , and his mother , Sarah Ford . Samuel was the first-born of the family . Nathaniel , who died in his twenty-fifth year , was the second and the last . Johnson very early began to manifest both his peculiar prejudices and his peculiar powers . When a mere child , we see him in Lichfield Cathedral , perched on his father 's shoulders , gazing at Sacheverel , the famous Tory preacher . We hear him , about the same time , roaring to his mother , who had given him , a minute before , a collect in the Common Prayer-Book to get by heart as his day 's task ,— “ Mother , I can say it already ! ” His first teacher , Dame Oliver , a widow , thought him , as she well might , the best scholar she ever had . From her he passed into the hands of one Tom Brown , an original , who once published a spelling-book , and dedicated it “ to the Universe ! ” — without permission , we presume . He began to learn Latin first with a Mr Hawkins , and then with a Mr Hunter , head-master of Lichfield ,— a petty tyrant , although a good scholar , under whom , to use Gay 's language , Johnson was “ Lash 'd into Latin by the tingling rod . ” At the age of fifteen , he was transferred to Stourbridge school , and to the care of a Mr Wentworth , who “ taught him a great deal . ” There he remained twelve months , at the close of which he returned home , and for two years lived in his father 's house , in comparative idleness , loitering in the fields , and reading much , but desultorily . In 1728 , being flattered with some promises of aid from a Shropshire gentleman , named Corbet , which were never fulfilled , he went to Oxford , and was entered as a commoner in Pembroke College . His father accompanied and introduced him to Dr Adams , and to Jorden , who became his tutor , recommending his son as a good scholar and a poet . Under Jorden 's care , however , he did little except translate Pope 's “ Messiah ” into Latin verse ,— a task which he performed with great rapidity , and so well , that Pope warmly commended it when he saw it printed in a miscellany of poems . About this time , the hypochondriac affection , which rendered Johnson 's long life a long disease , began to manifest itself . In the vacation of 1729 , he was seized with the darkest despondency , which he tried to alleviate by violent exercise and other means , but in vain . It seems to have left him during a fit of indignation at Dr Swinfen ( a physician at Lichfield , who , struck by the elegant Latinity of an account of his malady , which the sufferer had put into his hands , showed it in all directions ) , but continued to recur at frequent intervals till the close of his life . His malady was undoubtedly of a maniacal cast , resembling Cowper 's , but subdued by superior strength of will — a Bucephalus , which it required all the power of a Johnson to back and bridle . In his early days , he had been piously inclined , but after his ninth year , fell into a state of indifference to religion . This continued till he met , at Oxford , Law 's “ Serious Call , ” which , he says , “ overmatched ” and compelled him to consider the subject with earnestness . And whatever , in after years , were the errors of his life , he never , from that hour , ceased to have a solemn sense of the verities of the Christian religion . At Oxford , he paid little attention to his regular tasks , but read , or rather devoured , all the books he could lay his hands on , and began to display his unrivalled conversational powers , being often seen “ lounging about the college gates , with a circle of young students around him , whom he was entertaining with wit , keeping from their studies , and sometimes rousing to rebellion against the college discipline . ” He was , at this time , so miserably poor , that his shoes were worn to tatters , and his feet appeared through them , to the scandal of the Christ-Church men , when he occasionally visited their college . Some compassionate individual laid a new pair at his door , which he tossed away with indignation . At last ,— his debts increasing , his supplies diminishing , and his father becoming bankrupt ,— he was , in autumn 1731 , compelled to leave college without a degree . In the December of the same year his father died . Perhaps there was not now in broad Britain a person apparently more helpless and hopeless than this tall , half-blind , half-mad , and wholly miserable lad , with ragged shoes , and no degree , left suddenly fatherless in Lichfield . But he had a number of warm friends in his native place , such as Captain Garrick , father of the actor , and Gilbert Walmsley , Registrar of the Ecclesiastical Court , who would not suffer him to starve outright . He had learning and genius ; and he had , moreover , under all his indolence and all his melancholy , an indomitable resolution , which needed only to be roused to make all obstacles melt before it . He knew that he was great and strong , and would yet struggle into recognition . At first , however , nothing offered save the post of usher in a school at Market-Bosworth , which he occupied long enough to learn to loathe the occupation with all his heart and soul , and mind and strength , but which he soon resigned , and was again idle . He was invited next to spend some time with Mr Hector , an early friend , who was residing in Birmingham . Here he became acquainted with one Porter , a mercer , whose widow he afterwards married . Here , too , he executed his first literary work ,— a translation of Lobo 's “ Voyage to Abyssinia , ” which was published in 1735 , and for which he received the munificent sum of five guineas ! He had previously , without success , issued proposals for an edition of the Latin poems of Politian ; and , with a similar result , offered the service of his pen to Edward Cave , the editor and publisher of the Gentleman 's Magazine , to which he afterwards became a leading contributor . Shortly after this , Porter dying , Johnson married the widow — a lady more distinguished for sense , and particularly for the sense to appreciate his talents , than for personal charms , and who was twice her husband 's age . It does not seem to have been a very happy match , although , probably , both parties loved each other better than they imagined . He was now assisted by his wife 's portion , which amounted to £ 800 , and opened a private academy at Echal , near Lichfield , but obtained only three pupils ,— a Mr Offely , who died early , the celebrated David Garrick , and his brother George . At the end of a year and a half , disgusted alike with the duties of the office , and with his want of success in their discharge , Johnson left for London , with David Garrick for his companion , and reached it with one letter of</item>
     <item>introduction from Gilbert Walmsley , three acts of the tragedy of “ Irene , ” and ( according to his fellow-traveller ) threepence-halfpenny in his pocket ! To London he had probably looked as to the great mart of genius , but at first he met with mortifying disappointment . He made one influential friend , however , in an officer named Henry Hervey , of whom he said , “ He was a vicious man , but very kind to me ; were you to call a dog Hervey , I shall love him . ” In summer he came back to Lichfield , where he stayed three months , and finished his tragedy . He returned to London in autumn , along with his wife , and tried , but in vain , to get “ Irene ” presented on the stage . This did not happen till 1749 , when his old pupil David Garrick had become manager of Drury Lane Theatre . In March 1738 , he began to contribute to the Gentleman 's Magazine , a magazine he had long admired , and the original printing-place of which — St John 's Gate — he “ beheld with reverence ” when he first passed it . Amidst the variety of his contributions , the most remarkable were his “ Debates in the Senate of Lilliput ” — vigorous paraphrases of the parliamentary discussions — of which Johnson finding the mere skeleton given him by the reporters , was at the pains of clothing it with the flesh and blood of his own powerful diction . In May of the same year appeared his noble imitation of Juvenal , “ London , ” which at once made him famous . After it had been rejected by several publishers , it was bought by Dodsley for ten guineas . It came out the same morning with Pope 's satire , entitled “ 1738 , ” and excited a much greater sensation . The buzzing question ran , “ What great unknown genius can this be ? ” The poem went to a second edition in a week ; and Pope himself , who had read it with pleasure , when told that its author was an obscure man named Johnson , replied , “ He will soon be déterré . ” Famous as he had now become , he continued poor ; and tired to death of slaving for the booksellers , he applied , through the influence of Pope and Lord Gower , to procure a degree from Dublin , that it might aid him in his application for a school at Appleby , in Leicestershire . In this , however , he failed , and had to persevere for many years more in the ill-paid drudgery of authorship — meditating a translation of “ Father Paul 's History , ” which was never executed — writing in the Gentleman 's Magazine lives of Böerhaave and Father Paul , &amp; c ., &amp; c ., &amp; c .— and published separately “ Marmor Norfolciense , ” a disguised invective against Sir Robert Walpole , the obnoxious premier of the day . About this time he became intimate with the notorious Richard Savage , and with him spent too many of his private hours . Both were poor , both proud , both patriotic , both at that time lovers of pleasure , and they became for a season inseparable ; often perambulating the streets all night , engaged now , we fear , in low revels , and now in high talk , and sometimes determined to stand by their country when they could stand by nothing else . Yet , if Savage for a season corrupted Johnson , he also communicated to him much information , and at last left himself in legacy , as one of the best subjects to one of the greatest masters of moral anatomy . In 1744 , Johnson rolled off from his powerful pen , with as much ease as a thick oak a thunder-shower , the sounding sentences which compose the “ Life of Savage , ” and which shall for ever perpetuate the memory and the tale of that “ unlucky rascal . ” It is a wasp preserved in the richest amber . The whole reads like one sentence , and is generally read at one sitting . Sir Joshua Reynolds , meeting it in a country inn , began to read it while standing with his arm leaning on a chimney-piece , and was not able to lay it aside till he had finished it , when he found his arm totally benumbed . In 1745 , Johnson issued proposals for a new edition of Shakspeare , but laid them aside for a time , owing to the great expectations entertained of the edition then promised by Warburton . For several years , except a few trifles in the Gentleman 's Magazine , and his famous “ Prologue delivered at the Opening of Drury Lane Theatre , ” he seems to have written nothing . But in 1745 appeared the prospectus of his most laborious undertaking , the “ English Dictionary . ” This continued his principal occupation for some years , and , as Boswell truly observes , “ served to relieve his constitutional melancholy by the steady , yet not oppressive , employment it secured him . ” In its unity , too , and gigantic size , the task seemed fitted for the powers of so strong a man ; and although he says he dismissed it at last with “ frigid tranquillity , ” he had no doubt felt its influence during the time to be at once that of a protecting guardian and of an inspiring genius . In 1749 , he published his “ Vanity of Human Wishes , ” for which he received the sum of fifteen guineas ,— a miserable recompense for a poem which Byron pronounces “ sublime , ” and which is as true as it is magnificent in thought , and terse in language . In the same year , Garrick had “ Irene ” acted , but it was “ damned ” the first night , although it dragged on heavily for eight nights more . When the author was asked how he felt at its ill-success , he replied , “ Like the Monument ! ” How different from Addison , walking restlessly , and perspiring with anxiety behind the scenes , while the fate of “ Cato ” was hanging in the balance ! In 1750 he began his “ Rambler , ” and carried it on with only tolerable success till 1752 . The world has long ago made up its mind on the merits and defects of this periodical , its masculine thought and energetic diction , alternating with disguised common-place and ( as he would have said himself ) “ turgescent tameness ” — its critical and fictitious papers , often so rich in fancy , and felicitous in expression , mixed with others which exhibit “ bulk without spirit vast , ” and are chiefly remarkable for their bold , bad innovations on that English tongue of which the author was piling up the standard Dictionary . Many have dwelt severely on Johnson 's inequalities , without attending to their cause ; that was unquestionably the “ body of death ” which hung so heavily upon his system , and rendered writing at times a positive torment . Let his fastidious critics remember that he never spent a single day , of which he could say that he was entirely well , and free from pain , and that his spirits were often so depressed , that he was more than once seen on his knees , praying God to preserve his understanding . A great calamity now visited his household . This was the death of his wife . She expired on the 17th of March 1752 . She had been married to him sixteen years ; and notwithstanding the difference of age , and other causes of disagreement , he seems to have loved her with sincerity , and to have lamented her death with deep and long-continued sorrow . He relaxed not , however , an instant in his literary labours , continued the preparation of his Dictionary , and contributed a few lively and vigorous papers to the “ Adventurer ” — a paper , edited by Dr Hawkesworth , a writer of some talent , who did his best to tower up to the measure and stature of the “ Rambler . ” During this time Johnson was filling his house with a colony of poor dependants ,— such as Mrs Anna Williams , a soured female poetaster ; and Levet , a tenth-rate medical peripatetic , who , as well as Hodge , the great lexicographer 's cat , and Francis Barber , his black servant , now share in his immortality ,— besides becoming acquainted with such men of eminence as Reynolds , the inimitable painter ; Bennet Langton , the amiable and excellent country-gentleman ; and Beauclerk , the smart and witty “ man about town . ” In 1755 ( exactly a hundred years ago ) , Johnson chastised Lord Chesterfield for his mean , finessing conduct to him about his Dictionary , in a letter unparalleled , unless in “ Junius , ” for its noble and condensed scorn ,— a scorn which “ burns frore , ” cold performing the effect of fire — and which reached that callous Lord , under the sevenfold shield of his conceit and conventionalism ; visited Oxford , and was presented by acclamation with that degree of M. A . which he had left twenty-four years before without receiving ; and , in fine , issued his Dictionary , the work of eight years , and which , undoubtedly , is the truest monument of his talent , industry , and general capacity , if not of the richness of his invention , or of the strength of his genius . He had obtained for it only the sum of £ 1575 , which was all spent in the progress of the work ; and he was compelled again to become a contributor to the periodical press , writing copiously and characteristically to the Gentleman 's Magazine , the Universal Visitor , and the Literary Magazine . In 1756 , he was arrested for a debt of £ 5 , 18s ., but was relieved by Richardson , the novelist . In the same year he resumed his intention of an edition of Shakspeare , of which he issued proposals , and which he promised to finish in little more than a year , although nine years were to elapse ere it saw the light . In 1758 , he began the “ Idler , ” which reached the 103d No ., and was considered lighter and more agreeable than the “ Rambler . ” He has seldom written anything so powerful as his fable of “ The Vultures . ” In 1759 , his mother died , at the age of ninety ,— an event which deeply affected him . Soon after this , and to defray the expenses of her funeral , he wrote his brilliant tale of “ Rasselas , ” in the evenings of a single week ,— a rare feat of readiness and rapid power , reminding one of Byron writing the “ Corsair ” in a fortnight , and of Sir Walter Scott finishing “ Guy Mannering ” in three weeks . There are perhaps more invention and more fancy in “ Rasselas ” than in any of his works , although a gloom , partly the shadow of his mother 's death , and partly springing from his own temperament , rests too heavily on its pages . He received one hundred guineas for the copyright . In 1762 , the Earl of Bute , both as a reward for past services , and as a prepayment of future , bestowed on him a pension of £ 300 for life . This raised a clamour against him , which he treated with silent contempt . In 1763 occurred what was really a most important event in Johnson 's life ,— his acquaintance with Boswell ,— who attached himself to him with a devotion reminding one more of the canine species than of man , sacrificed to him much of his time , his feelings , his very individuality , and became qualified to write a biography , in which fulness , interest , minute detail , and dramatic skill have never been equalled or approached . In 1764 , Johnson founded the celebrated “ Literary Club , ” — perhaps the most remarkable cluster of distinguished men that ever existed ; and in 1765 he was created LL. D . by Trinity College , Dublin . In 1765 , too , he published his “ Shakspeare ; ” and he became intimate with the Thrales ,— the husband being a great brewer in Southwark ; the wife , a lady of literary tastes , better known as Madame Piozzi , the author of “ Anecdotes of Dr Johnson ; ” both distinguished for their attachment to him . He was often domesticated in their house for months together . In 1767 he had an interview with George III ., in the library of the Queen 's house ; which , because Johnson preserved his self-possession , and talked with his usual precision and power , has been recounted by Boswell as if it had been a conversation with an apostle or an angel . In 1770 he did some work for his pension in a pamphlet entitled the “ False Alarm , ” defending the conduct of the Ministry in the case of the Middlesex election . In 1771 he wrote another political pamphlet , entitled “ Thoughts on the late Transactions respecting Falklands ’ Islands ; ” and five years later appeared “ Taxation no Tyranny , ” — an elaborate defence of the American war . Johnson was too dogmatic , and too fiercely passionate for a good political writer ; and these productions added nothing to his fame , and increased the number of his enemies . In 1773 he fulfilled his long-cherished purpose of visiting Scotland and the Hebrides , the story of which trip he told afterwards in his usual rotund and massive style , and which was recounted with far more liveliness and verisimilitude by Boswell . In 1774 he lost Goldsmith , who had long been his friend , whom he had counselled , rebuked , assisted , loved , and laughed at , and at whose death he was deeply grieved . In 1775 , the publication of his “ Tour to the Hebrides ” brought him in collision with the perfervidum ingenium Scotorum , and especially with James Macpherson , to whom Johnson sent a letter which crushed him like a catapult . Macpherson , as well as Rob Roy , was only strong on his native heath , and off it was no match for old Sam , whose prejudices , passions , and gigantic powers , combined to make him altogether irresistible in a literary duel . The same year , the University of Oxford conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Laws ; and in the close of it , he paid a visit , along with the Thrales , to Paris . In 1776 nothing remarkable occurred in his history , unless it were the interview which Boswell so admirably manoeuvred to bring about between him and Jack Wilkes . Everybody remembers how well the bear and the monkey for the time agreed , and how both turned round to snub the spaniel , who had been the medium of their introduction to each other . In 1777 he was requested by the London booksellers to prefix prefaces to the “ English Poets , ” part of which was issued the next year , and the rest in 1780 and 1781 , as the “ Lives of English Poets . ” This work has generally been regarded as Johnson 's masterpiece . It nowhere , indeed , displays so much of the creative , the inventive , the poetical , as his “ Rasselas , ” and many of his smaller tales and fictions . Its judgments , too , have been often and justly controverted . The book is , undoubtedly , a storehouse of his prejudices , as well as of his wisdom . Its treatment of Milton , the man , for instance , is insufferably insolent , although ample justice is done to Milton , the poet of the “ Paradise Lost . ” Some poetasters he has overpraised , and some true but minor poets he has thrust down too far in the scale . But the work , as a whole , is full of inextinguishable life , and has passages verging on the eloquence and power of genius . A piece of stern , sober , yet broad and animated composition , rather careless in dates , and rather cursory in many of its criticisms , it displays unequalled force of thought , and pointed vigour of style , and when taken in connexion with the age of the author ( seventy ) , is altogether marvellous . Truly there were “ giants in those days , ” and this was a Briareus . For the details of his later life , his conversations , growing weakness , little journeys , unconquerable love of literature , &amp; c ., we must refer our readers to Boswell 's teeming narrative . In 1783 , he had a stroke of palsy , which deprived him for a time of speech . That returned to him , however , but a complication of complaints , including asthma , sciatica , and dropsy , began gradually to undermine his powerful frame . He continued to the last to cherish the prospect of a tour to Italy , but never accomplished his purpose . Death had all along been his great object of dread , and its fast approaches were regarded with unmitigated terror . “ Cut deeper , ” he cried to the physicians who were operating on his limbs ; “ cut deeper ; I do n't care for pain , but I fear death . ” He fixed all his dying hope upon the Cross , and recommended Clarke 's Sermons as fullest on the doctrine of a Propitiation . He spoke of the Bible and of the Sabbath with the warmest feelings of belief and respect . At last , on the 13th day of December 1784 , in the seventy-fifth year of his age , this great , good man , whose fears had subsided , and who had become as a little child , fell asleep in Jesus . He was buried in Westminster Abbey , on Monday , December 20th , and his funeral was attended by the most distinguished men of the day . Perhaps no literary man ever exerted , during his lifetime , the same personal influence as Samuel Johnson . Shelley used to call Byron the “ Byronic Energy , ” from a sense of his exceeding power . The author of “ Rasselas ” was the “ Johnsonian Energy ; ” and the demon within him , if not so ethereal and terrible as Byron 's , was far more massive , equally strong , and in conversation , at least , much more ready to do his work . First-rate conversation generally springs from a desire to shine , or from the effort of a full mind to relieve itself , or from exuberant animal spirits , or from deep-seated misery . In Johnson it sprang from a combination of all these causes . He went to conversation as to an arena — his mind was richly-stored , even to overflowing — in company his spirits uniformly rose — and yet there was always at his heart a burden of wretchedness , seeking solace , not in silence , but in speech . Hence , with the exception of Burke , no one ever matched him in talk ; and Burke , we imagine , although profounder in thought , more varied in learning , and more brilliant in imagination , seldom fairly pitted himself against Johnson . He was a younger man , and held the sage in too much reverence to encounter him often with any deliberate and determined purpose of contest . He frequently touched the shield of the general challenger , not with the sharp , but with the butt-end of his lance . He said , on one occasion , when asked why he had not talked more in Johnson 's company , “ Oh ! it is enough for me to have rung the bell to him ! ” In all Johnson 's works you see the traces of the triumphant conversationalist — of one who has met with few to contradict , and scarcely one to rival him . Hence the dogmatic strength and certainty , and hence , too , the one-sidedness and limitation of much of his writings . He does not “ allow for the wind . ” He seems to anticipate no reply , and to defy all criticism . One is tempted to quote the words of Solomon , “ He that is first in his own cause seemeth just , but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him . ” No such searching seems ever to have entered into Johnson 's apprehensions . His sentences roll forth like the laws of the Medes and Persians ; his praise alights with the authoritativeness of a sun-burst on a mountain ; summit ; and when he blames , he seems to add , like an ancient doomster , the words , “ I pronounce for doom . ” With Burke , it was very different . Accustomed to parliamentary debate in its vicissitudes and interchange — gifted , too , with a prophetic insight into coming objections , which “ cast their shadows before , ” and with an almost diseased subtlety of thinking , he binds up his answers to opponents with every thesis he propounds ; and his paragraphs sometimes remind you of the plan of generals in great emergencies , putting foot soldiers on the same saddles with cavalry — they seem to ride double . This is not the place , nor have we room , to dilate on Johnson 's obvious merits and faults — his straight-forward sincerity — his strong manly sense — the masterly force with which he grasps all his subjects — the measured fervour of his style — the precision and vivacity of his shorter sentences — the grand swell and sonorousness of his longer ; on his frequent monotony — his sesguipedalia verba — the “ timorous meaning ” which sometimes lurks under his “ boldest words ; ” or on the deep chiaroscuro which discolours all his pictures of man , nature , society , and human life . We have now only to speak of his poetry . That is , unfortunately , small in amount , although its quality is so excellent as to excite keen regret that he had not , as he once intended , written many more pieces in the style of “ London , ” and the “ Vanity of Human Wishes . ” In these , the model of his mere manner is Pope , although coloured by Juvenal , his Latin original ; but the matter and spirit are intensely his own . In “ London , ” satire seems swelling out of itself into something stronger and statelier — it is the apotheosis of that kind of poetry . You see in it a mind purer and sterner than Dryden 's , or Pope 's , or Churchill 's , or even Juvenal 's ; “ doing well to be angry ” with a degenerate age , and a false , cowardly country , of which he deems himself unworthy to be a citizen . If there is rather too much of the saeva indignatio , which Swift speaks of as lacerating his heart , it is a nobler and less selfish ire than his , and the language and verse which it inspires are full of the very soul of dignity . In the “ Vanity of Human Wishes , ” he becomes one of those “ hunters whose game is man ” ( to use the language of Soame Jenyns , in that essay on “ The Origin of Evil , ” which Johnson , in the Literary Review , so mercilessly lashed ) ; and from assailing premiers , parliaments , and the vices of London and England , he passes , in a very solemn spirit , to expose the vain hopes , wishes , and efforts of humanity at large . Parts of this poem are written more in sorrow than in anger , and parts more in anger than in sorrow . The portraits of Wolsey , Bacon , and Charles the Twelfth , are admirable in their execution , and in their adaptation to the argument of the piece ; and the last paragraph , for truth and masculine energy is unsurpassed , we believe , in the whole compass of ethical poetry . We are far from assenting to the statement we once heard ably and elaborately advocated , “ that there had been no strong poetry in Britain since the two satires of Johnson ; ” and we are still further from classing their author with the Shakspeares , Miltons , Wordsworths , and Coleridges of song ; but we are nevertheless prepared , not only for the sake of these two satires , of his prologue , and of some other pieces in verse , but on account of the general spirit of much of his prose , to pronounce him potentially , if not actually , a great poet .</item>

   <p>SPOKEN BY MR GARRICK , AT THE OPENING OF THE THEATRE-ROYAL DRURY-LANE , 1747 .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">When Learning 's triumph o'er her barbarous foes</l>
     <l n="2">First rear 'd the stage , immortal Shakspeare rose ;</l>
     <l n="3">Each change of many-colour 'd life he drew ,</l>
     <l n="4">Exhausted worlds , and then imagined new :</l>
     <l n="5">Existence saw him spurn her bounded reign ,</l>
     <l n="6">And panting Time toil 'd after him in vain ;</l>
     <l n="7">His powerful strokes presiding Truth impress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="8">And unresisted Passion storm 'd the breast .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Then Jonson came , instructed from the school ,</l>
     <l n="10">To please in method , and invent by rule ; 10</l>
     <l n="11">His studious patience and laborious art ,</l>
     <l n="12">By regular approach essay 'd the heart :</l>
     <l n="13">Cold Approbation gave the lingering bays ,</l>

     <l n="15">A mortal born , he met the general doom ,</l>
     <l n="16">But left , like Egypt 's kings , a lasting tomb .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">The wits of Charles found easier ways to fame ,</l>
     <l n="18">Nor wish 'd for Jonson 's art , or Shakspeare 's flame .</l>
     <l n="19">Themselves they studied ; as they felt , they writ :</l>
     <l n="20">Intrigue was plot , obscenity was wit . 20</l>
     <l n="21">Vice always found a sympathetic friend ;</l>
     <l n="22">They pleased their age , and did not aim to mend .</l>
     <l n="23">Yet bards like these aspired to lasting praise ,</l>
     <l n="24">And proudly hoped to pimp in future days .</l>
     <l n="25">Their cause was general , their supports were strong ;</l>
     <l n="26">Their slaves were willing , and their reign was long :</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="29">Then crush 'd by rules , and weaken 'd as refined ,</l>
     <l n="30">For years the power of Tragedy declined ; 30</l>
     <l n="31">From bard to bard the frigid caution crept ,</l>
     <l n="32">Till Declamation roar 'd , whilst Passion slept ;</l>
     <l n="33">Yet still did Virtue deign the stage to tread ,</l>
     <l n="34">Philosophy remain 'd though Nature fled .</l>
     <l n="35">But forced , at length , her ancient reign to quit ,</l>
     <l n="36">She saw great Faustus lay the ghost of Wit ;</l>
     <l n="37">Exulting Folly hail 'd the joyous day ,</l>

     <l n="43">Perhaps where Lear has raved , and Hamlet died ,</l>
     <l n="44">On flying cars new sorcerers may ride ;</l>
     <l n="45">Perhaps ( for who can guess the effects of chance ? )</l>
     <l n="46">Here Hunt<span corresp="#note2_3" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>may box , or Mahomet<span corresp="#note3_3" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>may dance .</l>
     <l n="47">Hard is his lot that , here by Fortune placed ,</l>
     <l n="48">Must watch the wild vicissitudes of Taste ;</l>
     <l n="49">With every meteor of Caprice must play ,</l>
     <l n="50">And chase the new-blown bubbles of the day . 50</l>
     <l n="51">Ah ! let not Censure term our fate our choice ,</l>
     <l n="52">The Stage but echoes back the public voice ;</l>
     <l n="53">The drama 's laws , the drama 's patrons give ,</l>

     <l n="10">Unpitying see them weep , and hear them pray ,</l>
     <l n="11">And unrelenting sport ten thousand lives away :</l>
     <l n="12">For you , ye fair ! I quit the gloomy plains , 10</l>
     <l n="13">Where sable Night in all her horror reigns ;</l>
     <l n="14">No fragrant bowers , no delightful glades ,</l>
     <l n="15">Receive the unhappy ghosts of scornful maids .</l>
     <l n="16">For kind , for tender nymphs , the myrtle blooms ,</l>
     <l n="17">And weaves her bending boughs in pleasing glooms ;</l>
     <l n="18">Perennial roses deck each purple vale ,</l>
     <l n="19">And scents ambrosial breathe in every gale ;</l>
     <l n="20">Far hence are banish 'd vapours , spleen , and tears ,</l>
     <l n="21">Tea , scandal , ivory teeth , and languid airs ;</l>
     <l n="22">No pug , nor favourite Cupid there enjoys 20</l>
     <l n="23">The balmy kiss for which poor Thyrsis dies ;</l>
     <l n="24">Form 'd to delight , they use no foreign arms ,</l>
     <l n="25">No torturing whalebones pinch them into charms ;</l>
     <l n="26">No conscious blushes there their cheeks inflame ,</l>
     <l n="27">For those who feel no guilt can know no shame ;</l>
     <l n="28">Unfaded still their former charms they show ,</l>
     <l n="29">Around them pleasures wait , and joys for ever new .</l>
     <l n="30">But cruel virgins meet severer fates ;</l>
     <l n="31">Expell 'd and exiled from the blissful seats ,</l>
     <l n="32">To dismal realms , and regions void of peace , 30</l>
     <l n="33">Where furies ever howl , and serpents hiss ,</l>
     <l n="34">O'er the sad plains perpetual tempests sigh ,</l>
     <l n="35">And poisonous vapours , blackening all the sky ,</l>
     <l n="36">With livid hue the fairest face o'ercast ,</l>
     <l n="37">And every beauty withers at the blast :</l>
     <l n="38">Where'er they fly , their lovers ’ ghosts pursue ,</l>
     <l n="39">Inflicting all those ills which once they knew ;</l>
     <l n="40">Vexation , fury , jealousy , despair ,</l>
     <l n="41">Vex every eye , and every bosom tear ;</l>
     <l n="42">Their foul deformities by all descried , 40</l>
     <l n="43">No maid to flatter , and no paint to hide .</l>
     <l n="44">Then melt , ye fair , while crowds around you sigh ,</l>
     <l n="45">Nor let disdain sit lowering in your eye ;</l>
     <l n="46">With pity soften every awful grace ,</l>
     <l n="47">And beauty smile auspicious in each face</l>
     <l n="48">To ease their pain exert your milder power ;</l>
     <l n="49">So shall you guiltless reign , and all mankind adore .</l>

   </lg>
   <p>THE LIFE AND POETRY OF THOMAS PARNELL .</p>
   <p>Parnell is the third in a trio of poetical clergymen whose names have immediately succeeded each other in this edition . Bowles , Churchill , and Parnell were all clergymen , and all poets ; but in other respects differed materially from each other . In Bowles , the clerical and the poetical characters were on the whole well attuned and harmonised . In Churchill , they came to an open rupture . In Parnell , they were neither ruptured nor reconciled , but maintained an ambiguous relation , till his premature death settled the moot point for ever .</p>
   <p>The life of this poet has been written by Goldsmith , by Johnson , by the Rev . John Mitford , and others ; but , after all , very little is known about him . Thomas Parnell was the descendant of an ancient family , which had been settled for some hundreds of years at Congleton , Cheshire . His father , whose name also was Thomas , took the side of the Commonwealth , and at the Restoration went over to Ireland , where he purchased a considerable property . This , along with his estate in Cheshire , devolved to the poet . His father had a second son , John , whose descendants were created baronets . The late Sir Henry Parnell , for some years the respected member of Parliament for the town of Dundee , where we now write , was the great-great-grandson of the poet 's father . Parnell was born in Dublin , in the year 1679 . He was sent to a school taught by one Dr Jones . Here he is said to have distinguished himself by the readiness and retentiveness of his memory ; often performing the task allotted for days in a few hours , and being able to repeat forty lines in any book of poems , after the first reading . It is a proof of the prematurity of his powers , that he entered Trinity College , Dublin , at the age of thirteen , where his compositions attracted attention from the extent of classical lore which they discovered . He took the degree of M. A . in 1700 ; and the same year ( through a dispensation on account of being under age ) was ordained deacon by the Bishop of Deny . Three years after , he was ordained priest ; and in 1705 , he was made Archdeacon of Clogher , by Sir George Ashe , bishop of that see . So soon as he received the archdeanery , he married Miss Ann Minchin , who is described as a young lady of great beauty , and of an amiable character , by whom he had two sons , who died young , and a daughter , who long survived both her parents .</p>
   <p>Up to the triumph of the Tories , at the end of Queen Anne 's reign , Parnell appears to have been , like his father , a keen Whig . He was at that time , however , induced , for motives which his biographers call obscure , but which to us seem obvious enough , on the well-known principle of the popularity of the rising sun , to change his party ; and he was hailed by the Tories as a valuable accession to their ranks . This proves that his talents were even then known ; a fact corroborated by Johnson 's statement , that while he was waiting in the outer-room at Lord Oxford 's levee , the prime minister , when told he was there , went out , at the persuasion of Swift , with his treasurer 's staff in his hand , and saluted him in the most flattering manner . He became , either before or immediately after this , intimate with Pope , Swift , Gay , and the rest of that brilliant set , who all appear to have loved him for his social qualities , to have admired his genius , and to have pitied his infirmities . He was a member of the Scriblerus Club , and contributed some trifles to their transactions . He was , at the same time , intimate with Addison and Steele , and wrote a few papers in the “ Spectator . ” To Pope , he was of essential service , assisting him in his notes to the “ Iliad , ” being , what Pope was not , a good Greek scholar . He wrote a life of Homer , which was prefixed to the Translation , although stiff in style , and fabulous in statement . He gratified Pope 's malicious spirit still more by writing , under the guise of a “ Life of Zoilus , ” a bitter attack on Dennis — the great object of the poet 's fear and mortal abhorrence . For these and other services , Pope rewarded him , after his usual manner , with large offerings of that sweet and suffocating incense , by which he delighted , now to gain his enemies , and now to gratify his friends . With Gay , also , Parnell was intimate ; and the latter , himself independent by his fortune , is said to have bestowed on this needy and improvident genius the price of the copyright of his works .</p>
   <p>Parnell first visited London in 1706 ; and from that period till his death , scarcely a year elapsed without his spending some time in the metropolis . He seems to have had as intense a relish of London life as Johnson and Boswell exhibited in the next age . So soon as he had collected his rents , he hied to the capital , and there enjoyed himself to the top of his bent . He jested with the Scriblerus Club . He quaffed now and then with Lord Oxford . He varied his round of amusements by occasional professional exhibitions in the pulpits of Southwark and elsewhere ,— made , we fear , more from a desire to display himself , than to benefit his hearers . Still his sermons were popular ; and he entertained at one time the hope ,— a hope blasted by the death of Queen Anne ,— of being preferred to a city charge . So soon as each London furlough was expired , he returned to Ireland , jaded and dispirited , and there took delight in nursing his melancholy ; in pining for the amusements of the metropolis ; in shunning and sneering at the society around him ; and in abusing his native bogs and his fellow-countrymen in verse . This was not manly , far less Christian conduct . He ought to have drowned his recollections of London in active duty , or in diligent study ; and if he found society coarse or corrupt , he should have set himself to refine and to purify it . But he seems to have been a lazy , luxurious person — his life a round of selfish rapture and selfish anguish ,— in fact , ruined by his independent fortune . Had he been a poorer , he had probably been a happier man . He was not , moreover , of that self-contained cast of character , which can live on its own resources , create its own world , and say , “ My mind to me a kingdom is . ”</p>
   <p>In 1712 he lost his wife , with whom he appears to have lived as happily as his morbid temperament and mortified feelings would permit . This blow deepened his melancholy , and drove him , it is said , to an excessive and habitual use of wine . In the same year we find him in London , brought out once more under the “ special patronage ” of Dean Swift , who had quite a penchant for Parnell , and who wished , through his side , to mortify certain persons in Ireland , who did not appreciate , he says , the Archdeacon ; and who , we suspect , besides , did not thoroughly appreciate the Dean . Swift , partly in pity for the “ poor lad , ” as he calls him , whom he saw to be in such imminent danger of losing caste and character , and partly in the true patronising spirit , introduced Parnell to Lord Bolingbroke , who received him kindly , entertained him at dinner , and encouraged him in his poetical studies . The Dean 's patronage , however , was of little avail in this matter to the protégé ; Bolingbroke , a man of many promises , and few performances , did nothing for him . The consequences of dissipation began , at this time , too , to appear in Parnell 's constitution ; and we find Swift saying of him , “ His head is out of order , like mine , but more constant , poor boy . ” It was perhaps to this period that Pope referred , when he told Spence , “ Parnell is a great follower of drams , and strangely open and scandalous in his debaucheries . ” If so , his bad habits seem to have sprung as much from disappointment and discontent as from taste .</p>
   <p>Yet Swift continued his friend , and it was at his instance that , in 1713 , Archbishop King presented Parnell with a prebend . In 1714 , his hope of London promotion died with Queen Anne ; but in 1716 , the same generous Archbishop bestowed on him the vicarage of Finglass , in the diocese of Dublin , worth £ 400 a-year . This preferment , however , the poet did not live long to enjoy ,— dying at Chester , in July 1717 , on his way to Ireland , aged thirty-eight years . His estates passed to his nephew , Sir John Parnell . He had , in the course of his life , composed a great deal of poetry ; much of it , indeed , invita Minerva . After his death , Pope collected the best pieces , and published them , with a dedication to Lord Oxford . Goldsmith , in his edition , added two or three ; and other editors , a good many poems , of which we have only inserted one , deeming the rest unworthy of his memory . In 1788 a volume was published , entitled , “ The Posthumous Works of Dr T. Parnell , containing poems moral and divine . ” These , however , attracted little attention , being mostly rubbish . Johnson says of them , “ I know not whence they came , nor have ever inquired whither they are going . ” It is said that the present representative of the Parnell family preserves a mass of unpublished poems from the pen of his relative . We trust that he will long and religiously refrain from disturbing their MS. slumbers .</p>
   <p>The whole tenor of Parnell 's history convinces us that he was an easy-tempered , kind-hearted , yet querulous and self-indulgent man , who had no higher motive or object than to gratify himself . His very ambition aspired not to very lofty altitudes . His utmost wish was to attain a metropolitan pulpit , where he could have added the reputation of a popular preacher to that of being the protégé of Swift , and the pet of the Scriblerus Club . The character of his poetry is in keeping with the temperament of the man . It is slipshod , easy , and pleasing . If the distinguishing quality of poetry be to give pleasure , then Parnell is a poet . You never thrill under his power , but you read him with a quiet , constant , subdued gratification . If never eminently original , he has the art of enunciating common-places with felicity and grace . The stories he relates are almost all old , but his manner of telling them is new . His thoughts and images are mostly selected from his common-place book ; but he utters them with such a natural ease of manner , that you are tempted to think them his own . He knows the compass of his poetical powers , and never attempts anything very lofty or arduous . His “ Allegory on Man , ” — pronounced by Johnson his best ,— seems rather a laborious than a fortunate effusion . His “ Hymn to Contentment ” is animated , as the subject required , by a kind of sober rapture . His “ Faery Tale ” is a good imitation of that old style of composition . His “ Hesiod ” catches the classical tone and spirit with considerable success . His “ Flies , ” and “ Elegy to the Old Beauty , ” are ingenious trifles . His “ Nightpiece on Death ” has fine touches , but is slight for such a theme , and must not be named beside Blair 's “ Grave , ” and Gray 's “ Elegy written in a Country Churchyard . ” His translations we have , in accordance with the plan of this edition , omitted — and , indeed , they are little loss . His “ Bookworm , ” &amp; c ., are adaptations from Beza and other foreign authors . By far his most popular poem is the “ Hermit . ” In it he tells a tale that had been told in Arabic , French , and English , for the tenth time ; and in that tenth edition tells it so well , that the public have thanked him for it as for an original work . Of course , the story not being Parnell 's , it is not his fault that it casts no light upon the dread problems of Providence it professed to explain . But the incidents are recorded with ease and liveliness ; the characters are rapidly depicted , and strikingly contrasted ; and many touches of true poetry occur . How vivid this couplet , for instance —</p>

    <head>THE HERMIT .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Far in a wild , unknown to public view ,</l>
     <l n="2">From youth to age a reverend hermit grew ;</l>
     <l n="3">The moss his bed , the cave his humble cell ,</l>
     <l n="4">His food the fruits , his drink the crystal well :</l>
     <l n="5">Remote from man , with God he pass 'd the days ,</l>
     <l n="6">Prayer all his business , all his pleasure praise .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">A life so sacred , such serene repose ,</l>
     <l n="8">Seem 'd heaven itself , till one suggestion rose :</l>
     <l n="9">That vice should triumph , virtue vice obey ,</l>
     <l n="10">This sprung some doubt of Providence 's sway ; 10</l>
     <l n="11">His hopes no more a certain prospect boast ,</l>
     <l n="12">And all the tenor of his soul is lost :</l>
     <l n="13">So when a smooth expanse receives impress 'd</l>
     <l n="14">Calm Nature 's image on its watery breast ,</l>
     <l n="15">Down bend the banks , the trees depending grow ,</l>
     <l n="16">And skies beneath with answering colours glow :</l>
     <l n="17">But if a stone the gentle scene divide ,</l>
     <l n="18">Swift ruffling circles curl on every side ,</l>
     <l n="19">And glimmering fragments of a broken sun ,</l>
     <l n="20">Banks , trees , and skies , in thick disorder run . 20</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="21">To clear this doubt , to know the world by sight ,</l>
     <l n="22">To find if books or swains report it right ,</l>
     <l n="23">( For yet by swains alone the world he knew ,</l>
     <l n="24">Whose feet came wandering o'er the nightly dew )</l>
     <l n="25">He quits his cell ; the pilgrim-staff he bore ,</l>
     <l n="26">And fix 'd the scallop in his hat before ;</l>
     <l n="27">Then with the sun a rising journey went ,</l>
     <l n="28">Sedate to think , and watching each event .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="29">The morn was wasted in the pathless grass ,</l>
     <l n="30">And long and lonesome was the wild to pass ; 30</l>
     <l n="31">But when the southern sun had warm 'd the day ,</l>
     <l n="32">A youth came posting o'er a crossing way ;</l>
     <l n="33">His raiment decent , his complexion fair ,</l>
     <l n="34">And soft in graceful ringlets waved his hair .</l>
     <l n="35">Then near approaching , ‘ Father , hail ! ’ he cried ,</l>
     <l n="36">‘ And hail , my Son ! ’ the reverend sire replied ;</l>
     <l n="37">Words follow 'd words , from question answer flow 'd ,</l>
     <l n="38">And talk of various kind deceived the road .</l>
     <l n="39">Till each with other pleased , and loth to part ,</l>
     <l n="40">While in their age they differ , join in heart : 40</l>
     <l n="41">Thus stands an aged elm in ivy bound ,</l>
     <l n="42">Thus youthful ivy clasps an elm around .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="43">Now sunk the sun ; the closing hour of day</l>
     <l n="44">Came onward , mantled o'er with sober gray ;</l>
     <l n="45">Nature in silence bid the world repose ;</l>
     <l n="46">When near the road a stately palace rose :</l>
     <l n="47">There by the moon through ranks of trees they pass ,</l>
     <l n="48">Whose verdure crown 'd their sloping sides of grass .</l>
     <l n="49">It chanced the noble master of the dome ,</l>
     <l n="50">Still made his house the wandering stranger 's home : 50</l>
     <l n="51">Yet still the kindness , from a thirst of praise ,</l>
     <l n="52">Proved the vain flourish of expensive ease .</l>
     <l n="53">The pair arrive : the liveried servants wait ;</l>
     <l n="54">Their lord receives them at the pompous gate ;</l>
     <l n="55">The table groans with costly piles of food ,</l>
     <l n="56">And all is more than hospitably good ;</l>
     <l n="57">Then led to rest , the day 's long toil they drown ,</l>
     <l n="58">Deep sunk in sleep , and silk , and heaps of down .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="59">At length ‘ tis morn , and at the dawn of day ,</l>
     <l n="60">Along the wide canals the Zephyrs play ; 60</l>
     <l n="61">Fresh o'er the gay parterres the breezes creep ,</l>
     <l n="62">And shake the neighbouring wood to banish sleep .</l>
     <l n="63">Up rise the guests , obedient to the call ;</l>
     <l n="64">An early banquet deck 'd the splendid hall ;</l>
     <l n="65">Rich luscious wine a golden goblet graced ,</l>
     <l n="66">Which the kind master forced the guests to taste .</l>
     <l n="67">Then pleased and thankful , from the porch they go ,</l>
     <l n="68">And , but the landlord , none had cause of woe ;</l>
     <l n="69">His cup was vanish 'd — for in secret guise</l>
     <l n="70">The younger guest purloin 'd the glittering prize . 70</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="71">As one who spies a serpent in his way ,</l>
     <l n="72">Glistening and basking in the summer ray ,</l>
     <l n="73">Disorder 'd stops to shun the danger near ,</l>
     <l n="74">Then walks with faintness on , and looks with fear :</l>
     <l n="75">So seem 'd the sire , when , far upon the road ,</l>
     <l n="76">The shining spoil his wily partner show 'd .</l>
     <l n="77">He stopp 'd with silence , walk 'd with trembling heart ,</l>
     <l n="78">And much he wish 'd , but durst not ask to part :</l>
     <l n="79">Murmuring he lifts his eyes , and thinks it hard ,</l>
     <l n="80">That generous actions meet a base reward . 80</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="81">While thus they pass , the sun his glory shrouds ,</l>
     <l n="82">The changing skies hang out their sable clouds ;</l>
     <l n="83">A sound in air presaged approaching rain ,</l>
     <l n="84">And beasts to cover scud across the plain .</l>
     <l n="85">Warn 'd by the signs , the wandering pair retreat ,</l>
     <l n="86">To seek for shelter at a neighbouring seat .</l>
     <l n="87">‘ Twas built with turrets , on a rising ground ,</l>
     <l n="88">And strong , and large , and unimproved around ;</l>
     <l n="89">Its owner 's temper , timorous and severe ,</l>
     <l n="90">Unkind and griping , caused a desert there . 90</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="91">As near the miser 's heavy doors they drew ,</l>
     <l n="92">Fierce rising gusts with sudden fury blew ;</l>
     <l n="93">The nimble lightning , mix 'd with showers , began ,</l>
     <l n="94">And o'er their heads loud-rolling thunder ran .</l>
     <l n="95">Here long they knock , but knock or call in vain ,</l>
     <l n="96">Driven by the wind , and batter 'd by the rain .</l>
     <l n="97">At length some pity warm 'd the master 's breast ,</l>
     <l n="98">( ‘ Twas then his threshold first received a guest )</l>
     <l n="99">Slow creaking turns the door with jealous care ,</l>
     <l n="100">And half he welcomes in the shivering pair ; 100</l>
     <l n="101">One frugal faggot lights the naked walls ,</l>
     <l n="102">And Nature 's fervour through their limbs recalls :</l>
     <l n="103">Bread of the coarsest sort , with eager<span corresp="#note1_12" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>wine ,</l>
     <l n="104">( Each hardly granted ) served them both to dine ;</l>
     <l n="105">And when the tempest first appear 'd to cease ,</l>
     <l n="106">A ready warning bid them part in peace .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="107">With still remark the pondering hermit view 'd ,</l>
     <l n="108">In one so rich , a life so poor and rude ;</l>
     <l n="109">And why should such , ( within himself he cried ,)</l>
     <l n="110">Lock the lost wealth a thousand want beside ? 110</l>
     <l n="111">But what new marks of wonder soon took place ,</l>
     <l n="112">In every settling feature of his face ,</l>
     <l n="113">When from his vest the young companion bore</l>
     <l n="114">That cup , the generous landlord own 'd before ,</l>
     <l n="115">And paid profusely with the precious bowl</l>
     <l n="116">The stinted kindness of this churlish soul !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="117">But now the clouds in airy tumult fly ,</l>
     <l n="118">The sun emerging opes an azure sky ;</l>
     <l n="119">A fresher green the smelling leaves display ,</l>
     <l n="120">And glittering as they tremble , cheer the day : 120</l>
     <l n="121">The weather courts them from the poor retreat ,</l>
     <l n="122">And the glad master bolts the wary gate .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="123">While hence they walk , the pilgrim 's bosom wrought</l>

   <p>that he may , through sufferings , sorrows , and the strainings of a long life , pile up a large and lofty poem ;— and there a Gray , in the intervals of other studies , produces a few short but exquisite verses , which become instantly and for ever popular , and render his name as dear to many , if not dearer , than that of the sublimer bard ; for there are probably thousands who would prefer to have written the “ Elegy written in a Country Churchyard , ” instead of the “ Paradise Lost . ”</p>
   <p>Thomas Gray was born in Cornhill , London , on the 26th December 1716 . His father was Mr Philip Gray , a respectable scrivener , and his mother 's name was Dorothy Antrobus . Gray was the fifth of twelve children , and the only one that survived . His life was saved in infancy by his mother , who , during a paroxysm which attacked her son , opened a vein with her own hand . This , and many other acts of maternal tenderness , rendered her memory unspeakably dear to the poet , who seldom mentioned her , after her death , “ without a sigh . ” He was sent to study at Eton College , the happy days spent in which he has so beautifully commemorated in his “ Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College . ” It added to his comfort here that his maternal uncle , Mr Antrobus , was an assistant-teacher . From Eton he passed to Pembroke College , Cambridge , where he was admitted as a pensioner in 1734 , in the nineteenth year of his age . He had at Eton become intimate with Horace Walpole and with Richard West , a young man of high promise , who died early . It is worth noticing that , during his residence both at Eton and Cambridge , he was supported entirely out of the separate industry of his mother , his father refusing him all aid .</p>
   <p>At Cambridge , Gray studied very hard , attending less to mathematics than to classical literature , modern languages , history , and poetry . He aspired to be a universally accomplished as well as a minutely learned man . His compositions , from 1734 to 1738 , were translations from Italian into Latin and English , and one or two small pieces of original verse . In September 1738 , he returned to his father 's house , and remained there for six months , doing little except carrying on a correspondence he had begun at Cambridge with West and other friends . Correspondence , from the first and to the last , was the best OUTCOME of Gray 's mind — he felt himself most at home in it ; and , next to Cowper 's , his letters are the most delightful in the English language .</p>
   <p>He had intended to study law , but was diverted from his purpose by Horace Walpole , who invited him to take in his Company the “ grand tour . ” To no Briton , since Milton , could travel have been more congenial or more instructive than to Gray . He that would travel to advantage must first have travelled in mind all the countries he visits , and must be learned in their literature , their politics , their scenery , and their antiquities , ere ever he sets a foot upon their shores . To Italy and France , Gray went as to favourite studies , not as to relaxations ; and spent his time in observing their famous scenes with the eye of a poet — cataloguing their paintings in the spirit of a connoisseur — perfecting his knowledge of their languages — examining minutely the principles of their architecture and music — comparing their present aspect with the old classical descriptions ; and writing home an elegant epistolary account of all his sights , and all his speculations . He saw Paris — visited Geneva — passed to Florence — hurried to Rome on the tidings of Pope Clement XII 's death , to see the installation of his successor — stood beside the cataracts of Tivoli and Terni , and might have seen in both , emblems of his own genius , which , like them , was beautiful and powerful , but artificial — took a rapid run to Naples , and was charmed beyond expression with its bay , its climate , and its fruitage — and was one of the first English travellers to visit Herculaneum , discovered only the year before ( 1739 ) , and to wonder at that strange and solemn rehearsal of the resurrection exhibited in its streets . From Naples he returned to Florence , where he continued eleven months , and began a Latin poem , “ De Principiis Cogitandi . ” He then , on the 24th of April 1741 , set off with Walpole for Bologna and Reggio . At this latter place occurred the celebrated quarrel between the two travellers . The causes and circumstances of this are involved in considerable obscurity . Dissimilarity of tastes and habits was probably at the bottom of it . Gray was an enthusiastic scholar ; Walpole was then a gay and giddy voluptuary , although predestined to sour down into the most cold-blooded and cynical of gossips . They parted at Reggio , to meet only once afterwards at Strawberry Hill , where Gray long after visited Walpole at his own invitation , but told him frankly he never could be on the same terms of friendship again . Left now to pursue his journey alone , he went to Venice , and thence came back through Padua and Milan to France . On his way between Turin and Lyons , he turned aside to see again the noble mountainous scenery surrounding the Grande Chartreuse in Dauphiné ; and in the album kept by the fathers wrote his Alcaic Ode , testifying to his admiration of a scene where , he says , “ every precipice and cliff was pregnant , with religion and poetry . ”</p>
   <p>Two months after his return to England , his father died , somewhat impoverished by improvidence . Gray , thinking himself too poor to study the law , sent his mother and a maiden sister to reside at Stoke , near Windsor , and retired to Peterhouse , Cambridge , where he resumed his classical and poetical pursuits . To West , who by this time was declining in health , he sent part of “ Agrippina , ” a tragedy he had commenced . West objected to the length and prosiness of Agrippina 's speeches . These were afterwards altered by Mason , in accordance with West 's suggestions ; but Gray was discouraged , and has left “ Agrippina ” a Torso . The subject was unpleasing . To have treated adequately the character of Nero , would have required more than the genius of Gray ; and the language of the fragment is distinguished rather by rhetorical burnish than by poetical spirit and heat . We have not thought it necessary to reprint it , nor several besides of the fragmentary and inferior productions of this poet , which Mason , too , thought proper to omit .</p>
   <p>Gray now plunged into the mare magnum of classical literature . With greater energy and exclusiveness than before , he read Thucydides , Theocritus , and Anacreon ; he translated parts of Propertius , and he wrote a heroic epistle in Latin , after the manner of Ovid , and a Greek epigram . This last he communicated to West , who was now in Hertfordshire , waiting the approach of the Angel of Death . To the same dear friend he sent his “ Ode to Spring , ” which he had written under his mother 's roof at Stoke . He was too late . West was dead before it arrived . This amiable and gifted person , who was thought by many superior in natural genius to his friend , and whose name is for ever connected with that of Gray , expired on the 1st of June 1742 , and now reposes in the chancel of Hatfield Church . We strongly suspect that it was he whom Gray had in his eye in the close of his “ Elegy . ”</p>
   <p>Autumn has often been thought propitious to genius , especially when its tender sun-light is still further sweetened and saddened by the joy of grief . In the autumn of this year , Gray , who was peculiarly susceptible to skiey influences , wrote some of his best poetry — his “ Hymn to Adversity , ” his “ Distant Prospect of Eton College , ” and commenced his “ Elegy written in a Country Churchyard . ” A Sonnet in English , and the Apostrophe which opens the fourth book of his “ De Principiis Cogitandi , ” bore testimony to his esteem for the character and his regret for the premature loss of Richard West .</p>
   <p>To Cambridge Gray seems to have had little attachment ; but partly from the smallness of his income , and partly from the access he had to its libraries , he was found there to the last , constantly complaining , and always continuing , like the statue of a murmurer . In the winter of 1742 he was admitted Bachelor of Civil Law ; and in acknowledgment of the honour of the admission , began an “ Address to Ignorance , ” which it is no great loss to his fame that he never finished . Hazlitt completed what appears to have been Gray 's design in that admirable and searching paper of his , entitled , “ The Ignorance of the Learned , ” in which he shows how ill mere learning supplies the want of common sense and practical knowledge , as well as of talent and genius .</p>
   <p>In 1744 , through the intervention of a lady , the difference between Walpole and Gray was so far made up , that they resumed their correspondence , although never their intimacy . About this time he got acquainted with Mason , then a scholar in St John 's College , who became a minor Boswell to a minor Johnson ; although he used liberties with Gray 's correspondence and poetry , such as Boswell never durst have attempted with his idol . Mason had first introduced himself to Gray by showing him some MS. poetry . With the famous Dr Conyers Middleton , too , he became intimate , and lived to lament his death .</p>
   <p>In 1747 , Dodsley published for him his “ Ode to Eton College , ” the first of Gray 's productions which appeared in print . It excited no notice whatever . Walpole wished him to publish his poems in conjunction with the remains of West ; but this he declined , on account of want of materials — perhaps also feeling the great superiority of his own poetry . At Walpole 's request , however , he wrote an ode on the death of his favourite cat !</p>
   <p>Greek became now his constant study . He read its more recondite authors , such as Pausanias , Athenaeus , Pindar , Lysias , and Æschylus , with great care , and commenced the preparation of a Table of Greek Chronology , on a very minute and elaborate scale .</p>
   <p>In 1749 he lost his aunt , Mrs Antrobus , and her death , which he felt as a heavy affliction , led him to complete his “ Elegy , ” which he sent to Walpole , who handed it about in MS ., to the great delight of those who were privileged to peruse it . When published , it sold rapidly , and continues still the most popular of his poems .</p>
   <p>In March 1753 , his beloved and revered mother died , and he erected over her dust a monument , with an inscription testifying to the strength of his filial love and sorrow . In 1755 he finished his “ Ode on the Progress of Poetry , ” and in the same year began his “ Bard . ” All his poems , however short , were most laboriously composed , written and rewritten , subjected , in whole or in part , to the criticism of his friends , and , according to their verdict , either published , or left fragments , or consigned to the flames . About this time he begins , in his letters , to complain of depression of spirits , of severe attacks of the gout , of sleepless nights , feverish mornings , and heavy days . He was now , and during the rest of his life , to pay the penalty of a lettered indolence and studious sloth , of a neglected body and an over-cultivated mind . The accident , it is said , of seeing a blind Welsh harper performing on a harp , excited him to finish his “ Bard , ” which in MS. appears to have divided the opinion of his friends , as it still does that of the critics .</p>
   <p>In 1758 Gray left Peterhouse , owing to some real or imaginary offence , and removed to Pembroke Hall , where he was surrounded by his old and intimate friends . The next year he carried his two Odes to London , as carefully as if they had been two Epics . Walpole says that he “ snatched them out of Dodsley 's hands , and made them ‘ the first-fruits of his own press at Strawberry Hill , ’ where a thousand copies were printed . When published , they attracted much attention , but did not gain universal applause . Obscurity was the principal charge brought against them . Their friends , however , including Warburton , Hurd , Mason , and Garrick , were vehement in their admiration , and loud in their encomiums . In this year Colley Cibber , the laureate , died , and the office was offered to Gray , with the peculiar and highly honourable condition , that he was to hold it as a sinecure . The poet , however , refused , on the ground , as he tells Mason , that the office had ‘ hitherto humbled its possessor . ’ ”</p>
   <p>In 1758 , he composed , for his amusement , a “ Catalogue of the Antiquities , Houses , &amp; c ., in England and Wales , ” which was , after his death , printed and distributed by Mason among his friends .</p>
   <p>The next year the British Museum was opened ( 15th January 1759 ) , and Gray went to London to read and transcribe the MSS . collected there from the Harleian and Cottoman libraries . During his residence in the capital , appeared two odes to “ Obscurity ” and “ Oblivion , ” in ridicule of his lyrics , from the pens of Colman and Lloyd , full of spirited satire , which failed , however , to disturb the poet 's equanimity . Like many fastidious writers , he was more afraid of his own taste , and of the strictures of good-natured friends , than of the attacks of foes . In 1762 he applied for the Professorship of Modern History , vacant by the death of Turner ; but it was given to Brochet , the tutor of Sir James Lowther .</p>
   <p>In 1765 he took a tour to Scotland , and saw many of its more interesting points — Stirling , Loch Tay , the Pass of Killierankie , and Glammis Castle , where he met Beattie . He wrote a very entertaining account of the journey , in his letters to his friends . He was offered an LL. D . by the College of Aberdeen ; but out of respect to his own University , declined the honour . In 1767 he added his “ Imitations of Welsh and Norwegian Poetry ” to his other productions . Sir Walter Scott tells us , that when Gray 's poems reached the Orkney and Shetland Isles , and when the “ Fatal Sisters ” was repeated by a clergyman to some of the old inhabitants , they remembered having sung it all in its native language to him years before . In 1768 , the Professorship of Modern History falling again vacant by Mr Brochet 's death , the Duke of Grafton instantly bestowed it on Gray , who , out of gratitude , wrote an ode on the installation of his patron to the Chancellorship of Cambridge University . He went from witnessing this ceremony to the Lakes of Cumberland , and kept an interesting journal of his tour to that then little known and most enchanting region . In 1770 , he visited Wales ; but owing probably to poor health , has left no notes of his journey . In May the next year , his health became worse , his spirits more depressed , an incurable cough preyed on his lungs ; he resigned his Professorship , and shortly after removed to London . There he rallied a little , and returned to Cambridge , where , on the 24th of July , he was seized with a severe attack of gout in the stomach . Of this he expired on the 30th , in the 55th year of his age , without any apparent fear of death . He was buried by the side of his mother , in the churchyard of Stoke . A monument was erected by Mason to his memory , in Westminster Abbey .</p>
   <p>Gray was a brilliant bookworm . In private he was a quiet , abstracted , dreaming scholar , although in the company of a few friends he could become convivial and witty . His heart , however , was always in his study . His portrait gives you the impression of great fastidiousness , and almost feminine delicacy of face , as well as of considerable self-esteem . His face has more of the critic than of the poet . His learning and accomplishments have been equalled perhaps by no poet since Milton . He knew the Classics , the Northern Scalds , the Italian poets and historians , the French novelists , Architecture , Zoology , Painting , Sculpture , Botany , Music , and Antiquities . But he liked better , he said , to read than to write . You figure him always lounging with a volume in his hand , on a sofa , and crying out , “ Be mine to read eternal novels of Marivaux and Crebillon . ” Against his moral character there exists no imputation ; and notwithstanding a sneering hint of Walpole 's , his religious creed seems to have been orthodox .</p>
   <p>With all his learning and genius , he has done little . His letters and poems remind you of a few scattered leaves , surviving the conflagration of the Alexandrian library . The very popularity of the scraps which such a writer leaves , secures the torments of Tantalus to his numerous admirers in all after ages . His letters , in their grace , freedom , minuteness of detail , occasional playfulness , delicious asides of gossip , and easy vigour of description , are more worthy of his powers , as a whole , than his poetry . The poetic fragments he has left are rarely of such merit as to excite any wish that they had been finished . His genius , although true and exquisite , was limited in its range , and hidebound in its movements . You see his genius , like a child , always casting a look of terror round on its older companion and guardian — his taste . Like Campbell , “ he often spreads his wings grandly , but shrinks back timidly to his perch again , and seems afraid of the shadow of his own fame . ” Within his own range , however , he is as strong as he is delicate and refined . His two principal Odes have , as we hinted , divided much the opinion of critics . Dr Johnson has assailed them in his worst style of captious and word-catching criticism . Now , that there is much smoke around their fire , we grant . But we argue that there is genuine fire amidst their smoke ,— first , from the fact that so many of their lines , such as ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The bloom of young Desire , and purple light of Love ; ”</l>
     <l n="2">“ The terror of his beak , and lightnings of his eye ; ”</l>
     <l n="3">“ Their feather-cinctured chiefs , and dusky loves ; ”</l>
     <l n="4">“ Sailing with supreme dominion</l>
     <l n="5">Through the azure deep of air ; ”</l>
     <l n="6">“ Beneath the good how far , but far above the great ”</l>
     <l n="7">“ High-born Hoel 's harp , and soft Llewellyn 's lay , ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>are so often and admiringly quoted ; and because , secondly , we can trace the influence of the “ Progress of Poetry , ” and of the “ Bard , ” on much of the higher song that has succeeded ,— on the poetry of Bowles , Coleridge , Wordsworth , Campbell , and Shelley . Gray was not a sun shining in his strength , but he was the morning star , prognosticating the coming of a warmer and brighter poetic day .</p>
   <p>He that can see no merit in the “ Ode on the Distant Prospect of Eton College , ” can surely never have been a boy . The boy 's heart beats in its every line , and yet all the experiences of boyhood are seen and shown in the sober light of those</p>
   <p>“ Years which bring the philosophic mind . ”</p>
   <p>Here lies the complex charm of the poem . The unthinking gaiety of boyhood , its light sports , its airy gladness , its springy motions , the “ tears forgot as soon as shed , ” the “ sunshine of the breast ” of that delightful period — are contrasted with the still and often sombre reflection , the grave joys , the carking cares , the stern concentred passions , the serious pastimes , the spare but sullen and burning tears , the sad smiles of manhood ; and contrasted by one who is realising both with equal vividness and intensity — because he is in age a man , and in memory and imagination an Eton schoolboy still . The breezes of boyhood return and blow on a head on which gray hairs are beginning “ here and there ” to whiten ; and he cries —</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ I feel the gales that from ye blow</l>
     <l n="2">A momentary bliss bestow ,</l>
     <l n="3">As , waving fresh their gladsome wing ,</l>
     <l n="4">My weary soul they seem to soothe ,</l>
     <l n="5">And redolent of joy and youth ,</l>
     <l n="6">To breathe a second spring . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Dr Johnson makes a peculiarly poor and unworthy objection to the next</l>
     <l n="8">stanza of the poem . Speaking of the address to the Thames —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">“ Say , Father Thames , for thou hast seen</l>
     <l n="10">Full many a sprightly race ; ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>he says , “ Father Thames has no better means of knowing than himself . ” He should have left this objection to those wretched mechanical critics who abound in the present day . He forgot that in his own “ Rasselas ” he had invoked the Nile , as the great “ Father of waters , ” to tell , if , in any of the provinces through which he rolled , he did not hear the language of distress . Critics , like liars , should have good memories .</p>
   <p>His remark that the “ Prospect of Eton College ” suggests nothing to Gray which every beholder does not equally think and feel , is , in reality , a compliment to the simplicity and naturalness of the strain . Common thought and feeling crystalised , is the staple of much of our best poetry . Gray says in a poetical way , what every one might have thought and felt , but no one but he could have so beautifully expressed . To the spirited translations from the Norse and Welsh , the only objection urged by Dr Johnson is , that their “ language is unlike the language of other poets ” — an objection which would tell still more powerfully against Milton , Collins , and Young , not to speak of the “ chartered libertines ” of our more modern song . But a running growl of prejudice is heard in every sentence of Gray 's Life by Johnson , and tends far more to injure the critic than the poet .</p>
   <p>In his “ Elegy written in a Country Churchyard , ” Gray has caught , concentred , and turned into a fine essence , the substance of a thousand meditations among the tombs . One of its highest points of merit , conceded by Dr Johnson , is essentially the same with which he had found fault in the “ Ode to Eton College . ” “ The poem abounds with images which find a mirror in every mind , and with sentiments to which every bosom returns an echo . ” Everything is in intense keeping . The images are few , but striking ; the language is severely simple ; the thought is at once obvious and original , at once clear and profound , and many of the couplets seem carefully and consciously chiselled for immortality , to become mottoes for every churchyard in the kingdom , and to “ teach the rustic moralist to die , ” while the country remains beautiful , and while death continues to inspire fear . And with what daring felicity of genius does the author introduce , ere the close , a living but anonymous figure amidst the company of the silent dead , and contrive to unite the interest of a personal story , the charm of a mystery , and the solemnity of a moral meditation , into one fine whole ! We know of but one objection of much weight to this exquisite elegy . There is scarcely the faintest or most faltering allusion to the doctrine of the resurrection . Death has it all his own way in this citadel of his power . The poet never points his finger to the distant horizon , where life and immortality are beginning to colour the clouds with the promise of the eternal morning . The elegy might almost have been written by a Pagan . In this point , Beattie , in his “ Hermit , ” has much the advantage of his friend Gray ; for his eye is anointed to behold a blessed vision , and his voice is strengthened thus to sing —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ On the pale cheek of Death smiles and roses are blending ,</l>
     <l n="2">And Beauty immortal awakes from the tomb . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Nevertheless , had Gray been known , not for his scholarship , not for his taste , not for his letters and minor poems , not for his reputed powers and unrivalled accomplishments , but solely for this elegy — had only it and his mere name survived , it alone would have entitled him to rank with Britain 's best poets .</p>

   <p>ADVERTISEMENT .— The author once had thoughts ( in concert with a friend ) of giving a history of English poetry . In the introduction to it he meant to have produced some specimens of the style that reigned in ancient times among the neighbouring nations , or those who had subdued the greater part of this island , and were our progenitors : the following three imitations made a part of them . He afterwards dropped his design ; especially after he had heard that it was already in the hands of a person<span corresp="#note2_8" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>well qualified to do it justice both by his taste and his researches into antiquity .</p>
   <p>PREFACE .— In the eleventh century , Sigurd , Earl of the Orkney Islands , went with a fleet of ships , and a considerable body of troops , into Ireland , to the assistance of Sigtryg with the Silken Beard , who was then making war on his father-in-law , Brian , King of Dublin . The Earl and all his forces were cut to pieces , and Sigtryg was in danger of a total defeat ; but the enemy had a greater loss by the death of Brian , their king , who fell in the action . On Christmas-day ( the day of the battle ) a native of Caithness , in Scotland , saw , at a distance , a number of persons on horseback riding full speed towards a hill , and seeming to enter into it . Curiosity led him to follow them , till , looking through an opening in the rocks , he saw twelve gigantic figures ,<span corresp="#note3_7" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>resembling women : they were all employed about a loom ; and as they wove they sung the following dreadful song , which , when they had finished , they tore the web into twelve pieces , and each taking her portion , galloped six to the north , and as many to the south .</p>

    <head>A LONG STORY .</head>
    <head>ADVERTISEMENT .— Gray 's ‘ Elegy , ’ previous to its publication , was handed about in MS ., and had , amongst other admirers , the Lady Cobham , who resided in the mansion-house at Stoke-Pogeis . The performance inducing her to wish for the author 's acquaintance , Lady Schaub and Miss Speed , then at her house , undertook to introduce her to it . These two ladies waited upon the author at his aunt 's solitary habitation , where he at that time resided , and not finding him at home , they left a card behind them . Mr Gray , surprised at such a compliment , returned the visit ; and as the beginning of this intercourse bore some appearance of romance , he gave the humorous and lively account of it which the ‘ Long Story ’ contains .</head>

   <p>THE POETICAL WORKS</p>
   <p>OF</p>
   <p>TOBIAS SMOLLETT .</p>
   <p>THE</p>
   <p>LIFE OF TOBIAS SMOLLETT .</p>
   <p>The combination of a great writer and a small poet , in one and the same person , is not uncommon . With not a few , while other , and severer branches of study are the laborious task of the day , poetry is the slipshod amusement of the evening . Dr Parr calls Johnson probabilis poeta — words which seem to convey the notion that the author of “ The Rambler , ” who was great on other fields , was in that of poetry only respectable . This term is more applicable to Smollett , whose poems discover only in part those keen , vigorous , and original powers which enabled him to indite “ Roderick Random ” and “ Humphrey Clinker . ” Yet the author of “ Independence , ” and “ The Tears of Scotland , ” must not be excluded from the list of British poets — an honour to which much even of his prose has richly entitled him .</p>
   <p>The incidents in Smollett 's history are not very numerous , and some of them are narrated , under faint disguises , with inimitable vivacity and vraisemblance in his own fictions . Tobias George Smollett was born in Dalquhurn House , near the village of Renton , Dumbartonshire , in 1721 . His father , a younger son of Sir James Smollett of Bonhill , having died early , the education of the poet devolved on his grandfather . The scenery of his native place was well calculated to inspire his early genius . It is one of the most beautiful regions in Scotland . A fine hollow vale , pervaded by the river Leven , and surrounded by rich woodlands and bold hills , stretches up from Dumbarton , with its double peaks and ancient castle , to the magnificent Loch Lomond ; and in one of the loops of this winding vale was the great novelist born and bred . He called his native region , in “ Humphrey Clinker , ” the “ Arcadia of Scotland , ” and has sung the Leven in one of his small poems . He was sent to the Grammar School of Dumbarton , and thence to Glasgow College . He was subsequently placed apprentice to one M. Gordon , a medical practitioner in Glasgow ; and from thence , according to some of his biographers , he proceeded to study medicine in Edinburgh . When he was about nineteen years of age , his grandfather expired , without having made any provision for him ; and he was compelled , in 1739 , to repair to London , carrying with him a tragedy entitled “ The Regicide , ” — the subject being the assassination of James the First of Scotland ,— which he had written the year before , and which he in vain sought to get presented at the theatres . He had letters of introduction to some eminent literary characters , who , however , either could not or would not do anything for him ; and he found no better situation than that of surgeon 's mate in an eighty-gun ship . He continued in the navy for six or seven years , and was present at the disastrous siege of Carthagena , in 1741 , which he has described in a Compendium of Voyages he compiled in 1756 , and with still more vigour in “ Roderick Random . ” His long acquaintance with the sea furnished ample materials for his genius , although it did not improve his opinion of human nature . Disgusted with the service , he quitted it in the West Indies , and lived for some time in Jamaica . Here he became acquainted with Miss Lascelles , a beautiful lady whom he afterwards married . She sat for the portrait of Narcissa , in “ Roderick Random . ”</p>
   <p>In 1746 he returned to England . He found the country ringing with indignation at the cruelties inflicted by Cumberland on the Highland rebels , and he caught and crystalised the prevalent emotion in his spirited lyric , “ The Tears of Scotland . ” He published the same year his “ Advice , ” — a satirical poem upon things in general , and the public men of the day in particular . He wrote also an opera entitled “ Alceste ” for Covent Garden ; but owing to a dispute with the manager , it was neither acted nor printed . In 1747 he produced “ Reproof , ” the second part of “ Advice , ” — a poem which breathes the same manly indignation at the abuses , evils , and public charlatans of the day . This year also he married Miss Lascelles , by whom he expected a fortune of three thousand pounds . This sum , however , was never fully realised ; and his generous housekeeping , and the expenses of a litigation to which he was compelled , in connection with Miss Lascelles ’ money , embarrassed his circumstances , and , much to the advantage of the world , drove him to literature . In 1748 , he gave to the world his novel of “ Roderick Random , ” — counted by many the masterpiece of his genius . It brought him in both fame and emolument . In 1749 he published , by subscription , his unfortunate tragedy , “ The Regicide . ” In 1750 he went to Paris , and shortly after wrote his “ Adventures of Peregrine Pickle , ” including the memoirs of the notorious Lady Vane — the substance of which he got from herself , and which added greatly to the popularity of the work . Notwithstanding the success he met with as a novelist , he was anxious to prosecute his original profession of medicine ; and having procured from a foreign university the degree of M. D ., he commenced to practise physic in Chelsea , but without success . He wrote , however , an essay “ On the External Use of Water , ” in which he seems to have partly anticipated the method of the cold-water cure . In 1753 he published his “ Adventures of Count Fathom ; ” and , two years later , encouraged by a liberal subscription , he issued a translation of “ Don Quixote , ” in two quarto volumes . While this work was printing , he went down to Scotland , visited his old scenes and old companions , and was received everywhere with enthusiasm . The most striking incident , however , in this journey was his interview with his mother , then residing in Scotston , near Peebles . He was introduced to her as a stranger gentleman from the West Indies ; and , in order to retain his incognita , he endeavoured to maintain a serious and frowning countenance . While his mother , however , continued to regard him steadfastly , he could not forbear smiling ; and she instantly sprang from her seat , threw her arms round his neck , and cried out , “ Ah , my son , I have found you at last ! Your old roguish smile has betrayed you . ”</p>
   <p>Returning to England , he resumed his literary avocations . He became the editor of the Critical Review — an office , of all others , least fitted to his testy and irritable temperament . This was in 1756 . He next published the “ Compendium of Voyages , ” in seven volumes , 12mo . In 1757 he wrote a popular afterpiece , entitled “ The Reprisals ; or , the Tars of England ; ” and in 1758 appeared his “ Complete History of England , ” in four volumes , quarto ,— a work said to have been compiled in the almost incredibly short time of fourteen months . It became instantly popular , although distinguished by no real historical quality , except a clear and lively style .</p>
   <p>An attack on Admiral Knowles in the Critical Review greatly incensed the Admiral ; and when he prosecuted the journal , Smollett stepped forward and avowed himself the author . He was sentenced to a fine of £ 100 , and to three months ’ imprisonment . During his confinement in King 's Bench , he composed the “ Adventures of Sir Lancelot Greaves , ” which appeared first in detached numbers of the British Magazine , and was afterwards published separately in 1762 . About this time , his busy pen was also occupied with histories of France , Italy , Germany , &amp; c ., and a continuation of his English History — all compilations — and some of them exceedingly unworthy of his genius . He became an ardent friend and supporter of Lord Bute , and started The Briton , a weekly paper , in his defence ; which gave rise to the North Briton , by Wilkes . In our Life of Churchill , we have recounted his quarrel with that poet , and the chastisement inflicted on Smollett in “ The Apology to the Critical Reviewers . ”</p>
   <p>In 1763 he lost his only daughter , a girl of fifteen . This event threw him into deep despondency , and seriously affected his health . He went to France and Italy for two years ; and on his return , in 1766 , published two volumes of Travels — full of querulous and captious remarks — for which Sterne satirised him , under the name of Smelfungus . The same year he again visited Scotland . In 1767 he published his “ Adventures of an Atom , ” — a political romance , displaying , under Japanese names , the different parties of Great Britain . A recurrence of ill health drove him back to Italy in 1770 . At Monte Nuovo , near Leghorn , he wrote his delightful “ Humphrey Clinker . ” This was his last work . He died at Leghorn on the 21st October 1771 , in the fifty-first year of his age . His widow erected a plain monument to his memory , with an inscription by Dr Armstrong . In 1774 a Tuscan monument was erected on the banks of the Leven by his cousin , James Smollett , Esq ., of Bonhill . As his wife was left in poor circumstances , the tragedy of “ Venice Preserved ” was acted at Edinburgh for her benefit , and the money remitted to Italy .</p>
   <p>Smollett , for variety of powers , and indefatigable industry , has seldom been surpassed . He was a politician , a poet , a physician , a historian , a translator , a writer of travels , a dramatist , a novelist , a writer on medical subjects , and a miscellaneous author . It is only , however , as a novelist and a poet that he has any claims to the admiration of posterity . His history survives solely because it is usually bound up with Hume 's . His translation of “ Don Quixote ” has been eclipsed by after and more accurate versions . His “ Tour to Italy ” is a succession of asthmatic gasps and groans . His “ Regicide ” , and other plays , are entirely forgotten . So also are his critical , medical , political , and miscellaneous effusions .</p>
   <p>In fiction he is undoubtedly a great original . He had no model , and has had no imitator . His qualities as a novel-writer are rapidity of narrative , variety of incident , ease of style , graphic description , and an exquisite eye for the humours , peculiarities , and absurdities of character and life . In language he is generally careless , but whenever a great occasion occurs , he rises to meet it , and writes with dignity , correctness , and power . His sea-characters , such as Bowling , and his characters of low-life , such as Strap , have never been excelled . His tone of morals is always low , and often offensively coarse . In wit , constructiveness , and general style , he is inferior to Fielding ; but surpasses him in interest , ease , variety , and humour , “ Roderick Random ” is the most popular and bustling of his tales . “ Peregrine Pickle ” is the filthiest and least agreeable ; its humours are forced and exaggerated , and the sea-characters seem caricatures of those in “ Roderick Random ; ” just as Norna of the Fitful Head , and Magdalene Graeme , are caricatures of Meg Merriless . “ Sir Lancelot Greaves ” is a tissue of trash , redeemed only here and there by traits of humour . “ The Adventures of an Atom ” we never read . “ Humphrey Clinker ” is the most delightful novel , with the exception of the Waverley series , in the English language . “ Ferdinand , Count Fathom , ” contains much that is disgusting , but parts of it surpass all the rest in originality and profundity . We refer especially to the description of the pretended English Squire in Paris , who bubbles the great bubbler of the tale ; to Count Fathom 's address to Britain , when he reaches her shores ,— a piece of exquisite mock-heroic irony ; to the narrative of the seduction in the west of England ; and to the matchless robber-scene in the forest ,— a passage in which one knows not whether more to admire the thrilling interest of the incidents , or the eloquence and power of the language . It is a scene which Scott has never surpassed , nor , except in the cliff-scene in the “ Antiquary , ” and , perhaps , the barn-scene in the “ Heart of Midlothian , ” ever equalled .</p>
   <p>Smollett 's poetry need not detain us long . In his twin satires , “ Advice ” and “ Reproof , ” you see rather the will to wound than the power to strike . There are neither the burnished compression , and polished , pointed malice of Pope , nor the gigantic force and vehement fury of Churchill . His “ Tears of Scotland ” is not thoroughly finished , but has some delicate and beautiful strokes . “ Leven Water ” is sweet and murmuring as that stream itself . His “ Ode to Independence , ” as we have said elsewhere , “ should have been written by Burns . How that poet 's lips must have watered , as he repeated the line —</p>
   <p>‘ Lord of the lion-heart and eagle-eye , ’</p>
   <p>and remembered he was not their author ! He said he would have given ten pounds to have written ‘ Donochthead ’ — he would have given ten times ten , if , poor fellow ! he had had them , to have written the ‘ Ode to Independence ’ — although , in his ‘ Vision of Liberty , ’ he has matched Smollett on his own ground . ” Grander lines than the one we have quoted above , and than the following —</p>
   <p>“ A goddess violated brought thee forth , ”</p>
   <p>are not to be found in literature . Round this last one , the whole ode seems to turn as on a pivot , and it alone had been sufficient to stamp Smollett a man of lofty poetic genius .</p>
