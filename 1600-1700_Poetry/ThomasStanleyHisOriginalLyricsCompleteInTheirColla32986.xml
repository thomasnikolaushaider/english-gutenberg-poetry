    <docTitle><titlePart>PREFATORY NOTE Thomas Stanley 's quiet life began in 1625 , the year of the accession of that King whom English poets have loved most . He came , though in the illegitimate line , from the great Stanleys , Earls of Derby . His father , descended from Edward , third Earl , was Sir Thomas Stanley of Leytonstone , Essex , and Cumberlow , Hertfordshire ; and his mother was Mary , daughter to Sir William Hammond of St. Alban 's Court , Nonington , near Canterbury . Following the almost unbroken law of the heredity of genius , Stanley derived his chief mental qualities from his mother ; and through her he was nearly related to the poets George Sandys , William Hammond , Sir John Marsham the chronologer , Richard Lovelace and his less famous brother ; as , through his father , to a fellow-poet perhaps dearer to him than any of these , Sir Edward Sherburne . His tutor , at home , not at College , was William Fairfax , son of the translator of Tasso . With translation in his own blood , that accomplished and affectionate gentleman succeeded in inspiring his forward charge with a taste for the same rather thankless game , and with a love of modern foreign classics which he never lost . It was thrown at Stanley , afterwards , that in courting the Muses , he had profited only too well by Fairfax 's aid : but the charge , if ever a serious one at all , was absurdly ill-founded . It may have been based on a wrong reading of that very generous acknowledgement beginning : ‘ If we are one , dear friend , ’ which is printed in this volume ; for the muddled misconstruing mind has existed in every intellectual society . Nothing is plainer than that Stanley , both by right of natural genius and of fastidious scholarship , was more than capable of beating his music out alone .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>The boy was sent to Pembroke College ,<settlement>Cambridge</settlement>, before he was fifteen , and was entered as a gentleman commoner of that University , passing by no means unmarked among a brilliant generation ; and there , in<date>1641</date>he graduated Master of Arts , being incorporated at<settlement>Oxford</settlement>in the same degree . He next set out , like all youths of his rank and age , upon that ‘ grand tour ’ which was still a perilous business . He returned to<country>England</country>in the full fury of the great Civil contest ( his family having emigrated to<country>France</country>, meanwhile ) , and settled down to work , not forensic , but literary , in the Middle Temple . There he fell to editing AEschylus , turning Anacreon into English , and planning the beginnings of his History of Philosophy . Best of all , he wrote , at leisure and by liking , his charming verses . Contemporaries not a few practised this same notable detachment , building nests , as it were , in the cannon 's mouth . Choosing the contemplative life , Stanley , like William Habington and Drummond of Hawthornden , was shut in with his mental activities , while many others whom they knew and whom we know , poor gay sparks of Parnassus , were dimming and blunting themselves on bloody fields . Like Habington and Drummond also in this , he was , though a passive Royalist , Royalist to the core . His Psalterium Carolinum ([ Greek : Eikon Basilike ] in metre ) , published three years before the Restoration , proves at least that if he were a non-combatant for the cause he believed in , he was no timid truckler to the power which crushed it . In<settlement>London</settlement>he seems to have lived throughout the war , suffering and surviving in the smallpox epidemic . He had married early , and , according to all evidence , most happily . His wife was Dorothy , daughter and co-heiress of Sir James Enyon , Baronet , of Flore , or Flower , Northamptonshire . ( It is curious , one may note in passing , that Thomas Stanley in the<settlement>Oxford</settlement>University Register is entered as an incorporated Cantabrigian ‘ of Flowre , Northants . ’ This was in his seventeenth year , when it is highly improbable that any property there could have been made over to him , unless with reference to his betrothal to Dorothy Enyon , then a child . ) One of Stanley 's devoted poetic circle joyfully salutes them on the birth of their second son , Sidney , ‘ Ere both the parents forty summers told , ’ as equal paragons . ‘ You two , ’ sings Hammond , ‘ who are in worthiness so near allied . ’ They enjoyed , together , a comfortable fortune , and gave even more generously , in proportion , than they had received . All Stanley 's tastes and habits were humanistic . He was the loyal and helpful friend of many English men of letters . To name his familiar associates is to call up a bright and thoughtful pageant , for they include , besides Lovelace and Suckling and Sherburne , the Bromes ; James Shirley ; John Davies of Kidwelly ; John Hall of Durham , better remembered now as the friend of Hobbes than as the prodigy his generation thought him ; and the genial Edward Phillips , the nephew of Milton . Though Stanley knew how to protest manfully when the profits of his mental labours were in danger of being withdrawn from him , yet he sought none of the usual awards of life , and never increased his patrimony . Indeed , his relative William Wotton said of him long after , in a Latin notice written for Elogia Gallorum , that Stanley lived engrossed in his studies , and let his private interests run to seed . He kept his learning and his liberty , his charity and peace and good repute ; and of his troubles and trials he has left , like the gallant philosopher he was , no record at all . A little brass in the chancel pavement of Clothall Church , near Baldock , witnesses to some of these : for there ‘ Thomas et Dorothea , parentes moesti , ’ laid two little sons to rest ... ‘ sit nomen Dnyi benedictum . ’ They lost other children , later ; but one son and three daughters survived their gentle father , when , after a severe illness , he was called away from a society which bitterly deplored him , in April ,<date>1678</date>. He died in Suffolk Street ,<settlement>London</settlement>, in the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields . Stanley was supposed by his contemporaries to have made himself immortal by his History of Philosophy , long a standard book , though hardly an original one . Indeed , they considered him , chiefly on account of it , ‘ the glory and admiration of his time ': the phrase is that of a careful critic , Winstanley . The work went into many editions ; his prose was used and read , while his verse was talked of , and passed lightly from hand to hand . As in the case of Petrarca , whose fine Latin tomes quickly perished , while his less regarded vernacular Rime rose to shine ‘ on the stretched forefinger of all Time , ’ so here was a little remainder of lovely English song to embalm an otherwise soon-buried name . Hardly any poet of his poetic day , to be discovered hereafter , can be appraised on a more intimate understanding , or can awaken a more endearing interest . Yet we know that save for one or two of his pieces extant here or there in anthologies ; save for a private reprint in<date>1814</date>by that tireless scholar and ‘ great mouser , ’ Sir Egerton Brydges ; save for Mr. A. H. Bullen 's valued reproduction of the Anacreontea , in<date>1893</date>, Thomas Stanley 's name is utterly unknown to the modern world . We have indeed travelled far from the ideals of the seventeenth century . Perhaps , after all , that is one of our blunders ; for every hour , nowadays , we are busy breaking a backward path through the historic underbrush , in order to speak with those singing gentlemen of ‘ the Warres , ’ whose art and statecraft and religion some of us ( who have seen the end of so much else ) , find incredibly attractive to our own . Their lawless vision , like that of children , and the mysterious trick of music in all their speech , are things we love instinctively , and never can regain . Out of their political storm , their hard thought , and high spirits , they can somehow give us rest : and it is chiefly rest which we crave of them . We appeal to each of these post-Elizabethans with the invitatory line of one of them : ‘ Charm me asleep with thy delicious numbers ! ’ The pleasure they can still give is inexhaustible , for unconscious genius like theirs , however narrow , is a deeper well than Goethe 's . Cast aside , and contemned , and left in the darkness long ago , the greater number of these English Alexandrians are as alive as the lamp in Tullia 's tomb ; and of these Stanley , as a craftsman , is almost first . He was a born man of letters ; he gave his whole life to meditation , to friendship , and to art ; he did his beautiful best , and cared nothing for results ; and though literary dynasties have come and gone , his work has sufficient vitality to-day to leap abreast of work which has never been out of the sphere of man 's appreciation , and has deserved all the appreciation which it got . Stanley 's fastidious strength , his wayward but concentrated grace , his spirit of liberty and scorn in writing of love ( which was one of the novel characteristic notes of Wither 's generation , and of Robert Jones 's before him ) ; the sunny , fearless mental motion , like that of a bird flying not far , but high , seem to our plodding scientific wits as unnatural as a Sibyllic intoxication . He strikes few notes ; he recognises his limits and controls his range ; but within these , he is for the most part as happy as Herrick , as mellow as Henry King , as free as Carew , and as capable as these were , and as those deeper natures , Crashaw and Vaughan , were not , of a short poem perfect throughout . He is the child of his age , moreover , in that his ingenuity never slumbers , and his speech must ever be concise and knotty . If he sports in the tangles of Neraea 's hair , it is because he likes tangles , and means to add to them . No Carolian poet was ever an idler ! Carew , perhaps , is Stanley 's nearest parallel . The latter shows the very same sort of golden pertness , masked in languid elegance , which goes to unify and heighten Carew 's memorable enchantment , and the same sheer singable felicity of phrase . But , unlike Carew , he has no glorious ungoverned swift-passing raptures ; there is in Stanley less fire and less tenderness . Nor has he anything to repent of . His imagination , as John Hall discerningly said of it , ‘ Makes soft Ionic turn grave Lydian . ’ Except Habington 's , no considerable body of amatory verse in all that century , certainly not even Cowley 's more artificial sequence of<date>1647</date>, is , on the whole , so free from stain . Stanley 's exemption did not pass unnoticed ; and William Fairfax ( ‘ no man fitter ! ’ ) is careful to instruct us that Doris , Celinda , and Chariessa were ‘ various rays ’ of ‘ one orient sun , ’ and further , that ‘ no coy ambitious names may here imagine earthly flames , ’ because the poet 's professional and deliberate homage was really paid to inward beauty , and never to ‘ roses of the cheek ’ alone . Here we run up against a sweet and famous moral of Carew 's , which not Carew , but Stanley , bears out as the better symbolist of the two . Our poet does not appear to have contributed towards the religious literature of a day when the torrent of intense life in human hearts bred so much heaven-mounting spray , as well as so much necessary scum and refuse . But his was a temperament so religious that one almost expects to find somewhere a manuscript volume of ‘ pious thoughts , ’ the shy fruit of Stanley 's Christian ‘ retirements ’ at home . It will be noticed that there is one sad devotional poem in this book , ‘ The lazy hours move slow ’ ; and as it appears only in John Gamble 's book ,<date>1657</date>, it may fairly be inferred that it was written later than the other lyrics . In<date>1657</date>Stanley was two-and-thirty , and his singing-time , so far as we know , was over . He had discharged it well . He fails where any true artist may ever be expected to fail , in verses occasional and complimentary . But , to balance this , he is often exceptionally happy when translating . His portrait , in middle age , by Faithorne after Lely , commends him to us all as quite worthy of the affection and applause which surrounded him from his youth , and never spoiled him . Brown-haired , hazel-eyed , fresh-cheeked , serene rather than gay , he seems the very incarnation of the ideal for which many others , less fortunate , hungered in that vexed<country>England</country>: the man ‘ innocent and quiet , ’ whose ‘ mind to him a kingdom is , ’ whose ‘ treasure is in Minerva 's tower , ’ and ‘ who in the region of himself remains . ’ Through the Civil struggle , the Commonwealth , the Restoration , he had followed a way of peace , without blame , and he is almost the only poet of the stormy time who is absolutely unaffected by it . He , at least , need not be discounted as a pathetic broken crystal : he can be judged on his own little plot of ground , without allowances , and by our strictest modern standards . His light bright best , his viridaria , have borne victoriously the lava-drift of nearly three centuries . An amorist of even temper and of malice prepense , a railer with a sound heart , an untyrannic master of his Muse , Stanley sings low to his small jocund lyre , and need not be too curiously questioned about his sincerity . How can it matter ? He gives delight ; he deserves the bays .</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>This little book is the first complete reprint of Stanley ever published : it is his original and inclusive output . The text is a new text , inasmuch as it represents the Editor 's choice of readings , among many variants ; but variants are noted throughout , and by their number and interest tell their own tale of Stanley 's exacting and sure taste . A few translated lyrics are gathered into an Appendix . The title-pages of his few volumes will be found cited in the accompanying List of Editions .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>But the only issues taken into account here , for textual purposes , are the three of<date>1647</date>,<date>1651</date>, and<date>1657</date>, of which last a word needs to be said . ( The edition of<date>1652</date>is an exact copy of<date>1651</date>, therefore negligible in the preparation of this book . ) The often-overlooked Ayres and Dialogues , Gamble 's and Stanley 's , appeared first privately , in<date>1656</date>, then in<date>1657</date>. The earlier issue is rare ; it figures in the British Museum Music Catalogues , but not in those of the Bodleian Library . There is at<settlement>Oxford</settlement>, however , a copy of the later edition , and on this the present editor bases the readings common both to<date>1656</date>and<date>1657</date>. As a general thing these readings of the Gamble Stanley are particularly satisfying , and besides having all the advantages in point of time , may have profited by the author 's careful revision . John Gamble 's music-book is devoted wholly to Stanley 's poems . It has a notably affectionate and , as it happens , a not-much-too-obsequious Preface , in which Gamble well says that he felt it ‘ a bold Undertaking to compose words which are so pure Harmonie in themselves , into any other Musick ’ ; yet that he longed to put it to the test , ‘ how neer a whole life spent in the study of Musical Compositions could imitate the flowing and naturall Graces which you have created by your Fancie . ’ Gamble wrote out no accompaniments to his sweet and spirited settings , nor did he leave Stanley 's titles prefixed to the numbered songs , a good proportion of which are translations , though not indicated as such . As to the present arrangement , for simplicity 's sake , it is nothing if not frankly chronological . It is divided into six sections ; the sixth contains those poems which must have appeared to Stanley to be his best , as they were included by him in every successive edition of his work . Form and method , therefore , are both , after a fashion , novel , but not without their good inherent justification , nor without fullest obedience of spirit to the author 's individual genius and its posthumous dues . The spelling has been modernised , and particular pains have been taken with the punctuation . This reprint is a deferent attempt to set forth Thomas Stanley as a little latter-day classic , in his old rich singing-coat , made strong and whole by means of coloured strands of his own weaving .</docImprint>

   </lg>
   <p>Not in the edition of 1651 . The poem is printed in this section on account of its relation to ‘ The Return , ’ which follows . ‘ The Return ’ is possibly but another version of ‘ Palinode . ’</p>
   <p>31 : 2 . P. 38 , line 5 . The Editor has ventured to print ‘ That would , ’ though against all three texts , which give ‘ That wouldst . ’ The meaning seems to be that the ‘ proud empire ’ of Beauty is rebellions to Reason or Philosophy , the restraints of which , ( ‘ chains ’ ) ‘ would within tyrannic laws confine , ’ etc .</p>

   <p>33 : 1 . P. 40 , line 25 . Eros .</p>
   <p>33 : 2 . P. 41 , line 56 . May the Editor be forgiven for altering , with no explicit help from printed texts , one word of this splendid lyric , in the very best impudent spirit of the time ? The second ‘ hearts ’ in the closing line reads ‘ they ’ in all editions of Stanley . It is possible that this word ‘ they ’ has been caught from the line just before , after a fashion only too familiar to copyists and printers . Even so , it would mean not ‘ lovers ’ but ‘ hearts . ’ The word ‘ hearts , ’ one is tempted to think , may be the right word .</p>
   <p>34 : 1 . To Chariessa : Beholding herself , etc . ( p. 41 ) .</p>
   <p>The edition of 1651 omits ‘ To Chariessa . ’ The Editor regrets having included it , by an oversight , in this section .</p>

   <p>SIR ,— You have been a merciful Creditor in the trust of these inestimable Poems so long with me , a person inconsiderable . But , I beseech you , think I have been sensible of the great obligation , and alwayes thought it a lesse trespass to break with all the world , then , by the least forgetfulness , make an unhappy forfeit of myself to your displeasure . Sir , I have brought home your Principal ; and though it be a thing beneath your generous expectation to look at profit , yet I thought it became my justice to tender you a small interest , the endevours of my poor Art , to wait upon it : I acknowledge it a bold Undertaking to compose your Words , ( which are so pure Harmonie in themselves ,) into any other Musick . But it was not in my ambition or hope to mend the least Accent or Emphasis w ^{ ch } they received from your own numerous Soul , but to essay how neer a whole life spent in the study of Musical Compositions could imitate the flowing and naturall Graces which you have created by your Fancie . I have onely to say , if my zeal have not stained what you have excellently made , I will not despair of your pardon ; and if any thing herein , ( the wel-meant tender of my service ,) may obtain your smile and permission , I shalbe confirmed in my thoughts that I may stil write myself ,— Sir , The most humble and faithful of your Servants , JOHN GAMBLE .</p>
