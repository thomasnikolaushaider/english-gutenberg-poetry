   <p>INTRODUCTION .</p>
   <p>There is scarcely an UN-DRAMATIC writer of the Seventeenth Century , whose poems exhibit so many and such gross corruptions as those of the author of LUCASTA . In the present edition , which is the first attempt to present the productions of a celebrated and elegant poet to the admirers of this class of literature in a readable shape , both the text and the pointing have been amended throughout , the original reading being always given in the footnotes ; but some passages still remain , which I have not succeeded in elucidating to my satisfaction , and one or two which have defied all my attempts at emendation , though , as they stand , they are unquestionably nonsense . It is proper to mention that several rather bold corrections have been hazarded in the course of the volume ; but where this has been done , the deviation from the original has invariably been pointed out in the notes .</p>
   <p>On the title-page of the copy of LUCASTA , 1649 , preserved among the King 's Pamphlets in the British Museum , the original possessor has , according to his usual practice , marked the date of purchase , viz ., June 21 ; perhaps , and indeed probably , that was also the date of publication . A copy of LUCASTA , 1649 , occasionally appears in catalogues , purporting to have belonged to Anne , Lady Lovelace ; but the autograph which it contains was taken from a copy of Massinger 's BONDMAN ( edit . 1638 , 4to . ) , which her Ladyship once owned . This copy of Lovelace 's LUCASTA is bound up with the copy of the POSTHUME POEMS , once in the possession of Benjamin Rudyerd , Esq ., grandson and heir of the distinguished Sir Benjamin Rudyerd , as appears also from his autograph on the title .&lt; 1. 1 ></p>
   <p>In the original edition of the two parts of LUCASTA , 1649-59 , the arrangement of the poems appears , like that of the text , to have been left to chance , and the result has been a total absence of method . I have therefore felt it part of my duty to systematise the contents of the volume , and , so far as it lay in my power , to place the various pieces of which it consisted in their proper order ; all the odes , sonnets , &amp; c. addressed or referring to the lady who is concealed under the names of LUCASTA and AMARANTHA have now been , for the first time , brought together ; and the copies of commendatory and gratulatory verses , with one exception prefixed by Lovelace to various publications by friends during his life-time , either prior to the appearance of the first part of his own poems in 1649 , or between that date and the issue of his Remains ten years later , have been placed by themselves , as an act of justice to the writer , of whose style and genius they are , as is generally the case with all compositions of the kind , by no means favourable specimens . The translations from Catullus , Ausonius , &amp; c. have been left as they stood ; they are , for the most part , destitute of merit ; but as they were inserted by the Poet 's brother , when he edited the posthumous volume , I did not think it right to disturb them , and they have been retained in their full integrity .</p>
   <p>Lovelace 's LUCASTA was included by the late S. W. Singer , Esq ., in his series of “ Early English Poets ; ” but that gentleman , besides striking out certain passages , which he , somewhat unaccountably and inconsistently , regarded as indelicate , omitted a good deal of preliminary matter in the form of commendatory verses which , though possibly of small worth , were necessary to render the book complete ; it is possible , that Mr. Singer made use of a copy of LUCASTA which was deficient at the commencement . It may not be generally known that , independently of its imperfections in other respects , Mr. Singer 's reprint abounds with the grossest blunders .</p>
   <p>The old orthography has been preserved intact in this edition ; but with respect to the employment of capitals , the entirely arbitrary manner in which they are introduced into the book as originally published , has made it necessary to reduce them , as well as the singularly capricious punctuation , to modern rules . At the same time , in those cases where capitals seemed more characteristic or appropriate , they have been retained .</p>
   <p>It is a singular circumstance , that Mr. Singer ( in common with Wood , Bliss , Ellis , Headley , and all other biographers ,) overlooked the misprint of ARAMANTHA for AMARANTHA , which the old compositor made , with one or two exceptions , wherever the word occurred . In giving a correct representation of the original title-page , I have been obliged to print ARAMANTHA .</p>
   <p>In the hope of discovering the exact date of Lovelace 's birth and baptism , I communicated with the Rev . A. J. Pearman , incumbent of Bethersden , near Ashford , and that gentleman obligingly examined the registers for me , but no traces of Lovelace 's name are to be found .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>&lt; 1. 1 > Mr. B. R. was a somewhat diligent collector of books , both English and foreign . On the fly-leaves of his copy of Rosse 's MYSTAGOGUS POETICUS , 1648 , 8vo ., he has written the names of a variety of works , of which he was at the time seemingly in recent possession .</p>
   <p>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICE .</p>
   <p>With the exception of Sir Egerton Brydges , who contributed to the GENTLEMAN 'S MAGAZINE for 1791-2 a series of articles on the life and writings of the subject of the present memoir , all the biographers of Richard Lovelace have contented themselves with following the account left by Anthony Wood of his short and unhappy career . I do not think that I can do better than commence , at least , by giving word for word the narrative of Wood in his own language , to which I purpose to add such additional particulars in the form of notes or otherwise , as I may be able to supply . But the reader must not expect much that is new : for I regret to say that , after the most careful researches , I have not improved , to any large extent , the state of knowledge respecting this elegant poet and unfortunate man .</p>
   <p>“ Richard Lovelace , ” writes Wood , “ the eldest son of Sir William Lovelace &lt; 2. 1 > of Woollidge in Kent , knight , was born in that country [ in 1618 ] , educated in grammar learning in Charterhouse &lt; 2. 2 > School near London , became a gent . commoner of Gloucester Hall in the beginning of the year 1634 ,&lt; 2. 3 > and in that of his age sixteen , being then accounted the most amiable and beautiful person that ever eye beheld ; a person also of innate modesty , virtue , and courtly deportment , which made him then , but especially after , when he retired to the great city , much admired and adored by the female sex . In 1636 , when the king and queen were for some days entertained at Oxon , he was , at the request of a great lady belonging to the queen , made to the Archbishop of Canterbury [ Laud ] , then Chancellor of the University , actually created , among other persons of quality , Master of Arts , though but of two years ’ standing ; at which time his conversation being made public , and consequently his ingenuity and generous soul discovered , he became as much admired by the male , as before by the female , sex . After he had left the University , he retired in great splendour to the court , and being taken into the favour of Lord George Goring , afterwards Earl of Norwich , was by him adopted a soldier , and sent in the quality of an ensign , in the Scotch expedition , an . 1639 . Afterwards , in the second expedition , he was commissionated a captain in the same regiment , and in that time wrote a tragedy called THE SOLDIER , but never acted , because the stage was soon after suppressed . After the pacification of Berwick , he retired to his native country , and took possession [ of his estate ] at Lovelace Place , in the parish of Bethersden ,&lt; 2. 4 > at Canterbury , Chart , Halden , &amp; c ., worth , at least , &lt; pounds > 500 per annum . About which time he [ being then on the commission of the peace ] was made choice of by the whole body of the county of Kent at an assize , to deliver the Kentish petition &lt; 2. 5 > to the House of Commons , for the restoring the king to his rights , and for settling the government , &amp; c. For which piece of service he was committed [ April 30 , 1642 ] to the Gatehouse at Westminster ,&lt; 2. 6 > where he made that celebrated song called , STONE WALLS DO NOT A PRISON MAKE , &amp; c. After three or four months ’ [ six or seven weeks ’ ] imprisonment , he had his liberty upon bail of &lt; pounds > 40 , 000 [&lt; pounds > 4000 ? ] not to stir out of the lines of communication without a pass from the speaker . During the time of this confinement to London , he lived beyond the income of his estate , either to keep up the credit and reputation of the king 's cause by furnishing men with horses and arms , or by relieving ingenious men in want , whether scholars , musicians , soldiers , &amp; c. Also , by furnishing his two brothers , Colonel Franc . Lovelace , and Captain William Lovelace ( afterwards slain at Caermarthen )&lt; 2. 7 > with men and money for the king 's cause , and his other brother , called Dudley Posthumus Lovelace , with moneys for his maintenance in Holland , to study tactics and fortification in that school of war . After the rendition of Oxford garrison , in 1646 , he formed a regiment for the service of the French king , was colonel of it , and wounded at Dunkirk ;&lt; 2. 8 > and in 1648 , returning into England , he , with Dudley Posthumus before mentioned , then a captain under him , were both committed prisoners to Peter House ,&lt; 2. 9 > in London , where he framed his poems for the press , entitled , LUCASTA : EPODES , ODES , SONNETS , SONGS , &amp; c ., Lond . 1649 , Oct . The reason why he gave that title was because , some time before , he had made his amours to a gentlewoman of great beauty and fortune , named Lucy Sacheverell , whom he usually called LUX CASTA ; but she , upon a stray report that Lovelace was dead of his wound received at Dunkirk , soon after married .&lt; 2. 10 > He also wrote ARAMANTHA [ Amarantha ] , A PASTORAL , printed with LUCASTA .&lt; 2. 11 > Afterwards a musical composition of two parts was set to part of it by Henry Lawes ,&lt; 2. 12 > sometimes servant to king Charles I ., in his public and private music .</p>
   <p>“ After the murther of king Charles I. Lovelace was set at liberty , and , having by that time consumed all his estate ,&lt; 2. 13 > grew very melancholy ( which brought him at length into a consumption ) , became very poor in body and purse , was the object of charity , went in ragged cloaths ( whereas when he was in his glory he wore cloth of gold and silver ) , and mostly lodged in obscure and dirty places , more befitting the worst of beggars and poorest of servants , &amp; c. After his death his brother Dudley , before mentioned , made a collection of his poetical papers , fitted them for the press , and entitled them LUCASTA : POSTHUME POEMS , Lond . 1659 ,&lt; 2. 14 > Oct ., the second part , with his picture before them .&lt; 2. 15 > These are all the things that he hath extant ; those that were never published were his tragedy , called THE SOLDIER or SOLDIERS , before mentioned ; and his comedy , called THE SCHOLAR ,&lt; 2. 16 > which he composed at sixteen years of age , when he came first to Gloucester hall , acted with applause afterwards in Salisbury Court . He died in a very mean lodging in Gunpowder Alley ,&lt; 2. 17 > near Shoe Lane ,&lt; 2. 18 > and was buried at the west-end of the church of S. Bride , alias Bridget , in London , near to the body of his kinsman Will . Lovelace , of Gray 's Inn , Esq ., in sixteen hundred fifty and eight ,&lt; 2. 19 > having before been accounted by all those that well knew him to have been a person well versed in the Greek &lt; 2. 20 > and Latin &lt; 2. 21 > poets , in music , whether practical or theoretical , instrumental or vocal , and in other things befitting a gentleman . Some of the said persons have also added , in my hearing , that his common discourse was not only significant and witty , but incomparably graceful , which drew respect from all men and women . Many other things I could now say of him , relating either to his most generous mind in his prosperity , or dejected estate in his worst state of poverty , but for brevity 's sake I shall now pass them by . At the end of his Posthume Poems are several elegies written on him by eminent poets of that time , wherein you may see his just character . ”</p>
   <p>Such is Wood 's account ; it is to be regretted that that writer did not supply the additional information , which he tantalizes us by saying that he possessed , and could have published , had he not been afraid of being tedious . His love of brevity is , in this case , most provoking .</p>
   <p>As might be expected , the Journals of Parliament cast additional light on the personal connexion of Lovelace with the Kentish Petition of 1642 , which was for the GENERAL redress of existing grievances , not , as the editor of the VERNEY PAPERS seems to have considered , merely for the adjustment of certain points relative to the Militia . Parliamentary literature has not a very strong fascination for the editors of old authors , and the biographers of Lovelace have uniformly overlooked the mine of information which lies in the LORDS ’ AND COMMONS ’ JOURNALS . The subject was apparently introduced , for the first time , into Parliament on the 28th March , 1642 , when a conference of both Houses took place , respecting “ a petition from Kent , which , praying for a Restoration of the Bishops , Liturgy and Common Prayer , and other constitutional measures , was voted seditious and against privilege and the peace of the kingdom ; ” on the same occasion , Lord Bristol and Mr. Justice Mallett were committed to the Tower for having in their possession a copy of the document . On the 7th April it was ordered by both Houses , that the Kentish Petition should be burned by the hands of the common hangman .</p>
   <p>On the 28th April , the Commons acquainted the Upper House , by Mr. Oliver Cromwell , “ that a great meeting was to be held next day on Blackheath , to back the rejected Kentish Petition . "&lt; 2. 22 ></p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Two days later , a strange scene occurred at Westminster .</l>
     <l n="2">Let the Commons ’ Journals tell the story in their own language :—</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ 30 April , 1642 . The House being informed that divers gentlemen of the county of Kent were at the door , that desired to present a petition to the House ;</p>
   <p>“ They were called in , presented their Petition , and withdrew .</p>
   <p>“ And their Petition was read , and appeared to be the same that was formerly burnt , by order of both Houses , by the hands of the common hangman . Captain LEIGH reports that , being at the Quarter Sessions held at MAIDSTONE , he observed certain passages which he delivered in writing .</p>
   <p>“ Captain Lovelace , who presented the Petition , was called in ; and Mr. Speaker was commanded to ask him , from whose hand he had this Petition , and who gave him warrant to present it .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Mr. GEO . CHUTE delivered him [ he replied ] the Petition the next day after the Assizes . ’</p>
   <p>“ ‘ The gentlemen [ he continued ] , that were assembled at BLACKHEATH , commanded him to deliver it . ’</p>
   <p>“ [ The Speaker then inquired ] whether he knew that the like was burnt by the order of this House , and that some were here questioned for the business .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ He understood a general rumour , that some gentlemen were questioned .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ He had heard a fortnight since , that the like Petition was burned by the hand of the common hangman .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ He knew nothing of the bundle of printed petitions . ’</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ He likewise said , ‘ that there was a petition at the Quarter</l>
     <l n="2">Sessions , disavowed by all the Justices there , which he tore . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ Sir William Boteler was likewise called in , [ and ] asked when he</l>
     <l n="4">was at Yorke .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">“ [ He ] answered , ‘ On Wednesday last was sevennight , he came from</l>
     <l n="6">Yorke , and came to his house in London .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="7">“ ‘ He heard of a petition that was never delivered .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="8">“ ‘ He never heard of any censure of the Parliament .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="9">“ ‘ He heard that a paper was burnt for being irregularly burnt</l>
     <l n="10">[? presented ] .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="11">“ ‘ He had heard that the Petition , that went under the name of</l>
     <l n="12">the Kentish Petition , was burnt by the hands of the common hangman .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="13">“ ‘ He never heard of any order of either , [ or ] of both , the Houses</l>
     <l n="14">concerning [ the Petition ] .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ ‘ He was at Hull on Thursday or Friday was a sevennight : as he came from Yorke , he took Hull in the way . He had heard , that Sir Roger Twisden was questioned for the like Petition .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ He was yesterday at BLACKHEATH . ’</p>
   <p>“ Resolved , upon the question , that Captain Lovelace shall be presently Committed prisoner to the Gatehouse .</p>
   <p>“ Resolved , upon the question , that Sir William Boteler shall be presently committed prisoner to the Fleet .</p>
   <p>“ Ordered , that the sergeant shall apprehend them , and carry them in safe custody , and deliver them as prisoners to the several prisons aforesaid . ”</p>
   <p>On the 4th May , 1642 , the House of Commons ordered Mr. Whittlock and others to prepare a charge against Mr. Lovelace and Sir William Boteler with all expedition ; but nothing further is heard of the matter till the 17th June , When Lovelace &lt; 2. 23 > and Boteler petitioned the House separately for their release from custody . Hereupon Sir William was discharged on finding personal bail to the extent of &lt; pounds > 10 , 000 , with a surety for &lt; pounds > 5000 ; and in the case of his companion in misfortune it was ordered , on the question , that “ he be forthwith bailed upon GOOD security . ” This “ good security , ” surely , did not reach the sum mentioned by Wood , namely , &lt; pounds > 40 , 000 ; but it is likely that the author of the ATHENAE is ONLY wrong by a cypher , and that the amount fixed was &lt; pounds > 4000 , as it has been already suggested . Thus Lovelace 's confinement did not exceed seven weeks in duration , and the probability , is that the sole inconvenience , which he subsequently experienced , was the loss of the bail .</p>
   <p>The description left by Wood and Aubrey of the end of Lovelace can only be reconciled with the fact , that his daughter and heiress conveyed Kingsdown , Hever ,&lt; 2. 24 > and a moiety of Chipsted , to the Cokes by marriage with Mr. Henry Coke , by presuming that those manors were entailed ; while Lovelace Place , as well perhaps as Bayford and Goodneston , not being similarly secured , were sold to defray the owner 's incumbrances . At any rate it is not , upon the whole , very probable that he died in a hovel , in a state of absolute poverty ;&lt; 2. 25 > that he received a pound a week ( equal to about &lt; pounds > 4 of our money ) from two friends , Cotton and another , Aubrey himself admits ; and we may rest satisfied that , however painful the contrast may have been between the opening and close of that career , the deplorable account given in the ATHENAE , and in the so-called LIVES OF EMINENT MEN , is much exaggerated and overdrawn .</p>
   <p>It has not hitherto been remarked , that among the Kentish gentry who , from time to time , elected to change the nature of their tenure from gavelkind to primogeniture , were the Lovelaces themselves , in the person of Thomas Lovelace ,&lt; 2. 26 > who , by Act of Parliament 2 and 3 Edw . VI . obtained , concurrently with several other families , the power of conversion . This Thomas Lovelace was not improbably the same , who was admitted a student of Gray 's Inn in 1541 ; and that he was of the Kentish Lovelaces there is not much reason to doubt ; although , at the same time , I am unable to fix the precise degree of consanguinity between him and Serjeant William Lovelace of Gray 's Inn , who died in 1576 , and who was great-grandfather to the author of LUCASTA . The circumstance that the real property of Thomas Lovelace aforesaid , situated in Kent , was released by Act of Parliament , 2 and 3 Edw . VI . from the operations of gavelkind tenure ( assuming , as is most likely to have been the case , that he was of the same stock as the poet , though not an immediate ancestor ,) seems to explain the following allusion by Dudley Lovelace in the verses prefixed by him to LUCASTA , 1649 :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Those by the landed have been writ ,</l>
     <l n="2">Mine 's but a younger-brother wit . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">As well as the subjoined lines by Lovelace in the poem entitled ,</l>
     <l n="4">“ To Lucasta , from Prison , ” ( see p. 44 of present edition ):—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">“ Next would I court my LIBERTY ,</l>
     <l n="6">And then my birthright , PROPERTY . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>There is evidence to prove that Lovelace was on intimate terms with some of the wits of his time , and that he had friendly relations with many of them — such as Hall , Rawlins , Lenton , and particularly the Cottons . John Tatham , the City Poet , and author of THE FANCIES THEATER , 1640 , knew him well , and addressed to him some stanzas , not devoid of merit , during his stay abroad . In 1643 , Henry Glapthorne , a celebrated dramatist and poet of the same age , dedicated to Lovelace his poem of WHITEHALL , printed in that year in a quarto pamphlet , with elegies on the Earls of Bedford and Manchester .&lt; 2. 27 > The pages of LUCASTA bear testimony to the acquaintance of the author with Anthony Hodges of New College , Oxford , translator of CLITOPHON AND LEUCIPPE from the Greek of Achilles Tatius ( or rather probably from a Latin version of the original ) , and with other &lt; 2. 28 > members of the University .&lt; 2. 29 ></p>
   <p>Although it is stated by Wood that LUCASTA was prepared for the press by Lovelace himself , on his return from the Continent in 1648 , it is impossible to believe that any care was bestowed on the correction of the text , or on the arrangement of the various pieces which compose the volume : nor did his brother Dudley Posthumus , who edited the second part of the book in 1659 , perform his task in any degree better . In both instances , the printer seems to have been suffered to do the work in his own way , and very infamously he has done it . To supply all the short-comings of the author and his literary executor at this distance of time , is , unfortunately , out of the power of any editor ; but in the present republication I have taken the liberty of rearranging the poems , to a certain extent in the order in which it may be conjectured that they were written ; and where Lovelace contributed commendatory verses to other works , either before or after the appearance of the first portion of LUCASTA , the two texts have been collated , and improved readings been occasionally obtained .</p>
   <p>The few poems , on which the fame of Lovelace may be said to rest , are emanations not only of the stirring period in which he lived , but of the peculiar circumstances into which he was thrown at different epochs of his life . Lovelace had not the melodious and exquisite taste of Herrick , the wit of Suckling , or the power of Randolph ( so often second only to his master Jonson ) . Mr. Singer has praised the exuberant fancy of Lovelace ; but , in my thinking , Lovelace was inferior in fancy , as well as in grace , both to Carew and the author of HESPERIDES . Yet Lovelace has left behind him one or two things , which I doubt if any of those writers could have produced , and which our greatest poets would not have been ashamed to own . Winstanley was so far right in instituting a comparison between Lovelace and Sydney , that it is hard to name any one in the entire circle of early English literature except Sydney and Wither , who could have attempted , with any chance of success , the SONG TO ALTHEA FROM PRISON ; and how differently Sydney at least would have handled it ! We know what Herrick would have made of it ; it would have furnished the theme for one more invocation to Julia . From Suckling we should have had a bantering playfulness , or a fescennine gaiety , equally unsuited to the subject . Waller had once an opportunity of realizing the position , which has been described by his contemporary in immortal stanzas ; but Waller , when he was under confinement , was thinking too much of his neck to write verses with much felicity , and preferred waiting , till he got back to Beaconsfield ( when his inspiration had evaporated ) , to pour out his feelings to Lady Dorothy or Lady Sophia . Wither 's song , “ Shall I wasting in Despair , ” is certainly superior to the SONG TO ALTHEA . Wither was frequently equal to Lovelace in poetical imagery and sentiment , and he far excelled him in versification . The versification of Lovelace is indeed more rugged and unmusical than that of any other writer of the period , and this blemish is so conspicuous throughout LUCASTA , and is noticeable in so many cases , where it might have been avoided with very little trouble , that we are naturally led to the inference that Lovelace , in writing , accepted from indolence or haste , the first word which happened to occur to his mind . Daniel , Drayton , and others were , it is well known , indefatigable revisers of their poems ; they “ added and altered many times , ” mostly for the better , occasionally for the worse . We can scarcely picture to ourselves Lovelace blotting a line , though it would have been well for his reputation , if he had blotted many .</p>
   <p>In the poem of the LOOSE SARABAND ( p. 34 ) there is some resemblance to a piece translated from Meleager in Elton 's SPECIMENS OF CLASSIC POETS , i . 411 , and entitled by Elton “ Playing at Hearts . ”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">“ Oh , shrill-voiced insect that , with dew-drops sweet</l>
     <l n="12">Inebriate , dost in desert woodlands sing . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">In the poem called “ The Grasshopper ” ( p. 94 ) , the author speaks</l>
     <l n="14">of the insect as</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="15">“ Drunk ev'ry night with a delicious tear ,</l>
     <l n="16">Dropped thee from heaven . ” ——</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The similarity , in each case , I believe to have been entirely accidental : nor am I disposed to think that Lovelace was under any considerable or direct obligations to the classics . I have taken occasion to remark that Lovelace seems to have helped to furnish a model to Cleveland , who carried to an extraordinary length that fondness for words and figures derived from the alchymist 's vocabulary ; but as regards the author of LUCASTA himself , it may be asserted that there are few writers whose productions exhibit less of book-lore than his , and even in those places , where he has employed phrases or images similar to some found in Peele , Middleton , Herrick , and others , there is great room to question , whether the circumstance can be treated as amounting to more than a curious coincidence .</p>
   <p>The Master of Dulwich College has obligingly informed me , that the picture of ALTHEA , as well as that of Lovelace himself , bequeathed by Cartwright the actor to Dulwich College in 1687 , bears no clue to date of composition , or to the artist 's name , and that it does not assist in the identification of the lady . This is the more vexatious , inasmuch as it seems probable that ALTHEA , whoever she was , became the poet 's wife , after LUCASTA 'S marriage to another . The CHLOES , &amp; c. mentioned in the following pages were merely more or less intimate acquaintances of Lovelace , like the ELECTRA , PERILLA , CORINNA , &amp; c. of Herrick . But at the same time an obscurity has hitherto hung over some of the persons mentioned under fictitious names in the poems of Lovelace , which a little research and trouble would have easily removed . For instance , no one who reads “ Amarantha , a Pastoral , ” doubts that LUCASTA and AMARANTHA are one and the same person . ALEXIS is Lovelace himself . ELLINDA is a female friend of the poet , who occasionally stayed at her house , and on one occasion ( p. 79 ) had a serious illness there . ELLINDA marries AMYNTOR , under which disguise , I suspect , lurks the well known Maecenas of his time , Endymion Porter . If Porter be AMYNTOR , of course ELLINDA must be the Lady Olivia Porter , his wife . ARIGO ( see the poem of AMYNTOR 'S GROVE ) signifies Porter 's friend , Henry Jermyn . It may be as well to add that the LETTICE mentioned at p. 121 , was the Lady Lettice Goring , wife of Lovelace 's friend , and third daughter of Richard Boyle , first Earl of Cork . This lady died before her husband , to whom she brought no issue .</p>
   <p>The following lines are prefixed to FONS LACHRYMARUM , &amp; c. by John Quarles , 1648 , 8vo ., and are subscribed , as will be seen , R. L .; they may be from the pen of Lovelace ; but , if so , it is strange that they were not admitted , with other productions of a similar character , into the volume published by the poet himself in 1649 , or into that edited by his brother in 1659 .</p>

It is , of course , a mere skeleton-tree , and furnishes no information as to the collateral branches , the connexion between the houses of Stanley and Lovelace , &amp; c. Sir Egerton Brydges ’ series of articles on Lovelace in the GENTLEMAN 'S MAGAZINE , with the exception of that from which the foregoing table is taken , does not contain much , if anything , that is new . On the 3rd of May , 1577 , Henry Binneman paid “ vi &lt; pence > and a copie ” to the Stationers ’ Company for the right to print “ the Briefe Course of the Accidents of the Deathe of Mr. Serjeant Lovelace ; ” and on the 30th of August following , Richard Jones obtained a licence to print “ A Short Epitaphe of Serjeant Lovelace . ” This was the same person who is described in the pedigree as dying in 1576 . His death happened , no doubt , like that of Sir Robert Bell and others , at the Oxford Summer assizes for 1576 . See Stow 's ANNALES , fol . 1154 .</p>

   <p>Sir William Lovelace , the poet 's grandfather who , according to Berry , died in 1629 , was a correspondent of Sir Dudley Carleton ( see CALENDARS OF STATE PAPERS , DOMESTIC SERIES , 1611-18 , pp . 443 , 521 , 533 ; Ibid . 1618-23 , p. 17 ) . It appears from some Latin lines before the first portion of LUCASTA , that the poet 's father served with distinction in Holland , and probably it was this circumstance which led to Lovelace himself turning his attention in a similar direction : for the latter was on service in the Low Countries , perhaps under his father ( of whose death we do not know the date , though Hasted intimates that he fell at the Gryll ) , when his friend Tatham , afterwards the city poet , addressed to him some verses printed in a volume entitled OSTELLA ( printed in 1650 ) .</p>
   <p>&lt; 2. 2 > Mr. A. Keightley , Registrar of the Charterhouse , with his usual kindness , examined for me the books of the institution , in the hope of finding the date of Lovelace 's admission , &amp; c ., but without success . Mr. Keightley has suggested to me that perhaps Lovelace was not on the foundation , which is of course highly probable , and which , as Mr. Keightley seems to think , may account for the omission of his name from the registers .</p>
   <p>&lt; 2. 3 > “ He was matriculated at Gloucester Hall , June 27 , 1634 , as “ filius Gul . Lovelace de Woolwich in Com . Kant . arm . au . nat . 16 . ’ ” — Dr. Bliss , in a note on this passage in his edition of the ATHENAE .</p>
   <p>&lt; 2. 4 > Bethersden is a parish in the Weald of Kent , eastward of Smarden , near Surrenden . “ The manor of Lovelace , ” says Hasted ( HISTORY OF KENT , iii . 239 ) , “ is situated at a very small distance SOUTH-WESTWARD from the church [ of Bethersden ] . It was in early times the property of a family named Grunsted , or Greenstreet , as they were sometimes called ; the last of whom , HENRY DE GRUNSTED , a man of eminent repute , as all the records of this county testify , in the reigns of both King Edward II . and III ., passed away this manor to KINET , in which name it did not remain long ; for WILLIAM KINET , in the 41st year of King Edward III ., conveyed it by sale to JOHN LOVELACE , who erected that mansion here , which from hence bore his name in addition , being afterwards styled BETHERSDEN-LOVELACE , from which sprang a race of gentlemen , who , in the military line , acquired great reputation and honour , and by their knowledge in the municipal laws , deserved well of the Commonwealth ; from whom descended those of this name seated at BAYFORD in SITTINGBORNE , and at KINGSDOWN in this county , the Lords Lovelace of Hurley , and others of the county of Berks . ” The same writer , in his HISTORY OF CANTERBURY , has preserved many memorials of the connexion of the Lovelaces from the earliest times with Canterbury and its neighbourhood . William Lovelace , in the reign of Philip and Mary , died possessed of the mansion belonging to the abbey of St. Lawrence , near Canterbury ; after the death of his son William , it passed to other hands . In 1621 , Lancelot Lovelace , Esq ., was Recorder of Canterbury ; in 1638 , Richard Lovelace , Esq ., held that office ; and in the year of the Restoration , Richard Lovelace , the poet 's brother , was Recorder . In the Public Library at Plymouth , there is a folio MS. ( mentioned in Mr. Halliwell 's catalogue , 1853 ) , containing “ Original Papers of the Molineux and LOVELACE Families . ” I regret that I have not had an opportunity of inspecting it . Mr. Halliwell does not seem to have examined the volume ; at all events , that gentleman does not furnish any particulars as to the nature of the contents , or as to the period to which the papers belong . This information , in the case of a MS. deposited in a provincial library in a remote district , would have been peculiarly valuable . It is possible that the documents refer only to the Lovelaces of Hurley , co. Berks .</p>
   <p>&lt; 2. 5 > “ The Humble Petition of the Gentry , Ministers , and Commonalty , for the county of Kent , agreed upon at the General Assizes for that county . ” See JOURNALS OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS , iv . 675-6-7 . The “ framers and contrivers ” of this petition were Sir Edward Dering , Bart ., of Surrenden-Dering ; Sir Roger Twysden , the well-known scholar ; Sir George Strode , and Mr. Richard Spencer . On the 21st May , 1641 , Dering had unsuccessfully attempted to bring in a bill for the ABOLITION of church government by bishops , archbishops , &amp; c ., whereas one of the articles of the petition of 1642 ( usually known as DERING 'S PETITION ) was a prayer for the restoration of the Liturgy and the maintenance of the episcopal bench in its integrity . A numerously signed petition had also been addressed to both Houses by the county in 1641 , in which the strongest reasons were given for the adoption of Dering 's proposed act . From 1641 to 1648 , indeed , the Houses were overwhelmed by Kentish petitions of various kinds . This portion of Wood 's narrative is confirmed by Marvell 's lines prefixed to LUCASTA , 1649 :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ And one the Book prohibits , because Kent</l>
     <l n="2">Their first Petition by the Authour sent . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Sir William Boteler , of Kent , returning about the beginning of APRIL 1642 , from his attendance ( being then Gentleman Pentioner ) on the king at YORKE , then celebrating St. GEORGE 'S feast , was by the earnest solicitation of the Gentry of Kent ingaged to joyn with them in presenting the most honest and famous Petition of theirs to the House of Commons , delivered by Captain RICHARD LOVELACE , for which service the Captain was committed Prisoner to the GATE HOUSE , and SIR WILLIAM BOTELER to the Fleet , from whence , after some weeks close imprisonment , no impeachment in all that time brought in against him [ Boteler ] , many Petitions being delivered and read in the House for his inlargement , he was at last upon bail of &lt; pounds > 20 , 000 [&lt; pounds > 15 , 000 ] remitted to his house in LONDON , to attend DE DIE IN DIEM the pleasure of the House . ” — MERCURIUS RUSTICUS , 1646 ( edit . 1685 , pp . 7 , 8 ) . The fact was that , although on the 7th of April , 1642 , the Kentish petition in favour of the Liturgy , &amp; c. had been ordered by the House of Commons to be burned by the common hangman ( PARLIAMENTS AND COUNCILS OF ENGLAND , 1839 , p. 384 ) , Boteler and Lovelace had the temerity , on the 30th of the same month , to come up to London , and present it again to the House . It was this which occasioned their committal . In the VERNEY PAPERS ( Camd . Soc . 1845 , p. 175 ) there is the following memorandum :—</p>
   <p>“ Captaine Lovelace committed to the Gatehouse ! Concerning Sir William Butler committed to the Fleete ! Deering 's ! petition . ”</p>

   <p>&lt; 2. 9 > Peter , or rather PETRE House , in Aldersgate Street , belonged at one time to the antient family by whose name it was known . The third Lord Petre , dying in 1638 , left it , with other possessions in and about the city of London , to his son William . ( Collins 's PEERAGE , by Brydges , vii . 10 , 11 . ) When Lovelace was committed to Peter House , and probably long before ( MERCURIUS RUSTICUS , ed . 1685 , pp . 76-79 ) , this mansion was used as a house of detention for political prisoners ; but in Ward 's DIARY ( ed . Severn , p. 167 ) , there is the following entry ( like almost all Ward 's entries , unluckily without date ):— “ My Lord Peters is an Essex man ; hee hath a house in Aldersgate Street , wherein lives the Marquis of Dorchester : ” implying that at that period ( perhaps about 1660 ) , the premises still belonged to the Petre family , though temporarily let to Lord Dorchester . Another celebrated house in the same street was London House , which continued for some time to be the town residence of the Bishops of London . When it had ceased to be an episcopal abode , it was adapted to the purposes of an ordinary dwelling , and , among the occupants , at a somewhat later period , was Tom Rawlinson , the great book-collector . See Stow , ed . 1720 , ii . lib . iii . p. 121 .</p>
   <p>&lt; 2. 10 > How different was the conduct , under similar circumstances , of the lady whom Charles Gerbier commemorates in his ELOGIUM HEROINUM , 1651 , p. 127 . “ Democion , the Athenian virgin , ” he tells us , “ hearing that Leosthenes , to whom she was contracted , was slain in the wars , she killed herself ; but before her death she thus reasoned with herself : ‘ Although my body is untoucht , yet should I fall into the imbraces of another , I should but deceive the second , since I am still married to the former in my heart . ’ ”</p>
   <p>&lt; 2. 11 > Wood 's story about LUCASTA having been a Lucy Sacheverell , “ a lady of great beauty and fortune , ” may reasonably be doubted . Lucasta , whoever she was , seems to have belonged to Kent ; the SACHEVERELLS were not a Kentish family . Besides , the corruption of Lucy Sacheverell into Lucasta is not very obvious , and rather violent ; and the probability is that the author of the ATHENAE was misled by his informant on this occasion . The plate etched by Lely and engraved by Faithorne , which is found in the second part of LUCASTA , 1659 , can scarcely be regarded as a portrait ; it was , in all likelihood , a mere fancy sketch , and we are not perhaps far from the truth in our surmise that the artist was nearly , if not quite , as much in the dark as to who Lucasta was , as we are ourselves at the present day .</p>
   <p>&lt; 2. 12 > This is a mistake on the part of Wood , which ( with many others ) ought to be corrected in a new edition of the ATHENAE . Lawes did not set to music AMARANTHA , A PASTORAL , nor any portion of it ; but he harmonized two stanzas of a little poem to be found at p. 29 of the present volume , and called “ To Amarantha ; that she would dishevel her Hair . ”</p>
   <p>&lt; 2. 13 > Hasted states that soon after the death of Charles I. the manor of Lovelace-Bethersden passed by purchase to Richard Hulse , Esq .</p>
   <p>&lt; 2. 14 > On the title-page of this portion of LUCASTA , as well as on that which had appeared in 1649 , the author is expressly styled RICHARD LOVELACE , ESQ . : yet in Berry 's KENT GENEALOGIES , p. 474 , he is , curiously enough , called SIR Richard Lovelace , KNT . It is scarcely necessary to observe that the error is on Berry 's side .</p>
   <p>&lt; 2. 15 > The most pleasing likeness of Lovelace , the only one , indeed , which conveys any just idea to us of the “ handsomest man of his time , ” is the picture at Dulwich , which has been twice copied , in both instances with very indifferent success . One of these copies was made for Harding 's BIOGRAPHICAL MIRROR . Bromley ( DICTIONARY OF ENGRAVED BRITISH PORTRAITS , 1793 , p. 101 ) correctly names F [ rancis ] Lovelace , the writer 's brother , as the designer of the portrait before the POSTHUME POEMS .</p>
   <p>&lt; 2. 16 > Winstanley , perhaps , intended some allusion to these two lost dramas from the pen of Lovelace , when he thus characterizes him in his LIVES OF THE POETS , 1687 , p. 170 :— “ I can compare no man , ” he says , “ so like this Colonel LOVELACE as SIR PHILIP SIDNEY , of which latter it is said by one in an epitaph made of him :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Nor is it fit that more I should acquaint ,</l>
     <l n="2">Lest men adore in one</l>
     <l n="3">A Scholar , SOULDIER , Lover , and a Saint . ’ ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>As to the comparison , Winstanley must be understood to signify a resemblance between Lovelace and Sydney as men , rather than as writers . Winstanley 's extract is from WITS ’ RECREATIONS , but the text , as he gives it , varies from that printed by the editor of the reprint of that work in 1817 .</p>
   <p>&lt; 2. 17 > Gunpowder Alley still exists , but it is not the Gunpowder Alley which Lovelace knew , having been rebuilt more than once since 1658 , It is now a tolerably wide and airy court , without any conspicuous appearance of squalor . There is no tradition , I am sorry to say , respecting Lovelace ; all such recollections have long been swept away . When one of the old inhabitants told me ( and there are one or two persons who have lived here all their life ) that a great poet once resided thereabout , I naturally became eager to catch the name ; but it turned out to be Dr. Johnson , not Lovelace , the latter of whom might have been contemporary with Homer for aught they knew to the contrary in Gunpowder Alley . It appears from Decker and Webster 's play of WESTWARD HOE , 1607 ( Webster 's Works , ed . Hazlitt , i . 67 ) , that there was another Gunpowder Alley , near Crutched Friars .</p>
   <p>&lt; 2. 18 > Hone ( EVERY-DAY BOOK , ii . 561 , edit . 1827 ) , states , under date of April 28 , that “ during this month in 1658 the accomplished Colonel Richard Lovelace died IN THE GATEHOUSE AT WESTMINSTER , whither he had been committed , ” &amp; c. No authority , however , is given for in assertion so wholly at variance with the received view on the subject , and I am afraid that Hone has here fallen into a mistake .</p>
   <p>&lt; 2. 19 > Aubrey , in what are called his LIVES OF EMINENT MEN , but which are , in fact , merely rough biographical memoranda , states under the head of Lovelace :— “ Obiit in a cellar in Long acre , a little before the restauration of his Matie . Mr. Edm . Wyld , &amp; c. had made collections for him , and given him money ..... Geo . Petty , haberdasher , in Fleet street , carried xx &lt; shillings > to him every Monday morning from Sr .... Many and Charles Cotton , Esq . for .... moneths , BUT WAS NEVER REPAYD . ” Aubrey was certainly a contemporary of Lovelace , and Wood seems to have been indebted to him for a good deal of information ; but all who are acquainted with Aubrey are probably aware that he took , in many instances , very little trouble to examine for himself , but accepted statements on hearsay . Wood does not , in the case of Lovelace , adopt Aubrey 's account , and it is to be observed that , IF the poet died as poor as he is represented by both writers to have died , he would have been buried by the parish , and , dying in Long Acre , the parochial authorities would not have carried him to Fleet Street for sepulture .</p>
   <p>P. xxiv . MR. EDM [ UND ] WYLD . This gentleman , the friend of Aubrey , Author of the MISCELLANIES , &amp; c ., and (? ) the son of Sir Edmund Wyld , seems to have furnished the former with a variety of information on matters of current interest . See Thoms ’ ANECDOTES AND TRADITIONS , 1839 , p. 99 . He is , no doubt , the E. W . Esq ., whom Aubrey cites as his authority on one or two occasions , in his REMAINS OF GENTILISM AND JUDAISM . He was evidently a person of the most benevolent character , and Aubrey ( LIVES OF EMINENT MEN , ii . 483 ) pays him a handsome tribute , where he describes him as “ a great fautor of ingenious and good men , for meer merit 's sake . ”</p>
   <p>&lt; 2. 20 > See p. 149 , NOTE 3 .&lt; i. e . note 63. 4 > His acquaintance with Hellenic literature possibly extended very little beyond the pages of the ANTHOLOGIA .</p>
   <p>&lt; 2. 21 > His favourites appear to have been Ausonius and Catullus .</p>
   <p>&lt; 2. 22 > On the 5th May , 1642 , a counter-petition was presented by some Kentish gentlemen to the House of Commons , disclaiming and condemning the former one .— JOURNALS OF THE H. OF C. ii . 558 .</p>
   <p>&lt; 2. 23 > “ The humble petition of Richard Lovelace , Esquire , a prisoner in the Gate-house , by a former order of this House . ” — JOURNALS , ii . 629 .</p>
   <p>&lt; 2. 24 > This property , which was of considerable extent and value , was purchased of the Cheney family , toward the latter part of the reign of Henry VI , by Richard Lovelace , of Queenhithe .</p>
   <p>&lt; 2. 25 > I do not think that there is any proof , that Gunpowder-alley was , at the time when Lovelace resided there , a particularly poor or mean locality .</p>
   <p>&lt; 2. 26 > See Lambarde ( PERAMBULATION OF KENT , 1570 , ed . 1826 , p. 533 ) .</p>
   <p>&lt; 2. 27 > As so little is known of the personal history of Lovelace , the reader may not be displeased to see this Dedication , and it is therefore subjoined :—</p>
   <p>“ To my Noble Friend And Gossip , CAPTAIN RICHARD LOVELACE . “ Sir , “ I have so long beene in your debt that I am almost desperate in my selfe of making you paiment , till this fancy by ravishing from you a new curtesie in its patronage , promised me it would satisfie part of my former engagements to you . Wonder not to see it invade you thus on the sudden ; gratitude is aeriall , and , like that element , nimble in its motion and performance ; though I would not have this of mine of a French disposition , to charge hotly and retreat unfortunately : there may appeare something in this that may maintaine the field courageously against Envy , nay come off with honour ; if you , Sir , please to rest satisfied that it marches under your ensignes , which are the desires of “ Your true honourer , “ Hen . Glapthorne . ”</p>
   <p>&lt; 2. 28 > It has never , so far as I am aware , been suggested that the friend to whom Sir John Suckling addressed his capital ballad :—</p>
   <p>“ I tell thee , Dick , where I have been , ”</p>
   <p>may have been Lovelace . It was a very usual practice ( then even more so than now ) among familiar acquaintances to use the abbreviated Christian name in addressing each other ; thus Suckling was JACK ; Davenant , WILL ; Carew , TOM , &amp; c .; in the preceding generation Marlowe had been KIT ; Jonson , BEN ; Greene , ROBIN , and so forth ; and although there is no positive proof that Lovelace and Suckling were intimate , it is extremely probable that such was the case , more especially as they were not only brother poets , but both country gentlemen belonging to neighbouring counties . Suckling had , besides , some taste and aptitude for military affairs , and could discourse about strategics in a city tavern over a bowl of canary with the author of LUCASTA , notwithstanding that he was a little troubled by nervousness ( according to report ) , when the enemy was too near .</p>
   <p>&lt; 2. 29 > From Andrew Marvell 's lines prefixed to LUCASTA , 1649 , it seems that Lovelace and himself were on tolerably good terms , and that when the former presented the Kentish petition , and was imprisoned for so doing , his friends , who exerted themselves to procure his release , suspected Marvell of a share in his disgrace , which Marvell , according to his own account , earnestly disclaimed .

   <p>P. 10 . JOHN PINCHBACK , COL [ ONEL ] . Pinchback neither is nor was , I believe , a name of common occurrence ; and it is just possible that the Colonel may be the very “ old Jack Pinchbacke ” mentioned by Sir Nicholas L'Estrange , in his MERRY PASSAGES AND JESTS , of which a selection was given by Mr. Thoms in his ANECDOTES AND TRADITIONS , 1839 . L'Estrange , it is true , describes the Colonel as a “ gamester and rufler , daubed with gold lace ; ” but this is not incompatible with the identity between the PINCHBACKE , who figures in LUCASTA , and OLD JACK , who had perhaps not always been “ a gamester and ruffler , ” and whose gold lace had , no doubt , once been in better company than that which he seems to have frequented , when L'Estrange knew him . The “ daubed gold lace , ” after all , only corresponds with the picture , which Lovelace himself may have presented in GUNPOWDER ALLEY days .</p>

    <head>SIR , Ovr times are much degenerate from those , Which your sweet Muse , which your fair fortune chose ; And as complexions alter with the climes , Our wits have drawne th ’ infection of our times . That candid age no other way could tell To be ingenious , but by speaking well . Who best could prayse , had then the greatest prayse ; ‘ Twas more esteemd to give then wear the bayes . Modest ambition studi 'd only then To honour not her selfe , but worthy men . These vertues now are banisht out of towne , Our Civill Wars have lost the civicke crowne . He highest builds , who with most art destroys , And against others fame his owne employs . I see the envious caterpillar sit On the faire blossome of each growing wit . The ayre 's already tainted with the swarms Of insects , which against you rise in arms . Word-peckers , paper-rats , book-scorpions , Of wit corrupted the unfashion 'd sons . The barbed censurers begin to looke Like the grim Consistory on thy booke ; And on each line cast a reforming eye Severer then the yong presbytery . Till , when in vaine they have thee all perus 'd , You shall for being faultlesse be accus 'd . Some reading your LUCASTA will alledge You wrong 'd in her the Houses priviledge ; Some that you under sequestration are , Because you write when going to the Warre ; And one the book prohibits , because Kent Their first Petition by the Authour sent . But when the beauteous ladies came to know , That their deare Lovelace was endanger 'd so : Lovelace , that thaw 'd the most congealed brest , He who lov 'd best , and them defended best , Whose hand so rudely grasps the steely brand , Whose hand so gently melts the ladies hand , They all in mutiny , though yet undrest , Sally 'd , and would in his defence contest . And one , the loveliest that was yet e 're seen , Thinking that I too of the rout had been , Mine eyes invaded with a female spight ( She knew what pain ‘ t would be to lose that sight ) . O no , mistake not , I reply 'd : for I In your defence , or in his cause , would dy . But he , secure of glory and of time , Above their envy or mine aid doth clime . Him valianst men and fairest nymphs approve , His booke in them finds judgement , with you , love . Andr . Marvell</head>

Besides the present lines , and some to be found in the posthumous volume , of which he was the editor , this gentleman contributed the following commendatory poem to AYRES AND DIALOGUES [ by Thomas Stanley Esq . ] set by John Gamble , 1656 . The verses themselves have little merit ; and the only object which I had in introducing them , was to add to the completeness of the present edition :—</p>
   <p>TO MY MUCH HONORED COZEN , MR. STANLEY , UPON HIS POEMS SET BY MR. JOHN GAMBLE .</p>
   <p>I . Enough , enough of orbs and spheres , Reach me a trumpet or a drum , To sound sharp synnets in your ears , And beat a deep encomium .</p>
   <p>II . I know not th ’ Eight Intelligence : Those that do understand it , pray Let them step hither , and from thence Speak what they all do sing or say :</p>
   <p>III . Nor what your diapasons are , Your sympathies and symphonies ; To me they seem as distant farre As whence they take their infant rise .</p>
   <p>IV . But I 've a grateful heart can ring A peale of ordnance to your praise , And volleys of small plaudits bring To clowd a crown about your baies .</p>
   <p>V. Though laurel is thought thunder free , That storms and lightning disallows , Yet Caesar thorough fire and sea Snatches her to twist his conquering brows .</p>
   <p>VI . And now me thinks like him you stand I ’ th ’ head of all the Poets ’ hoast , Whilest with your words you do command , They silent do their duty boast .</p>
   <p>VII . Which done , the army ecchoes o 're , Like Gamble Ios one and all , And in their various notes implore , Long live our noble Generall . Dudley Posthumus Lovelace .</p>

   <p>SONG . SET BY MR. HENRY LAWES .&lt; 16. 1 > TO LUCASTA . GOING BEYOND THE SEAS .</p>
   <p>I . If to be absent were to be Away from thee ; Or that when I am gone , You or I were alone ; Then my LUCASTA might I crave Pity from blustring winde or swallowing wave .</p>
   <p>II . But I'le not sigh one blast or gale To swell my saile , Or pay a teare to swage The foaming blew-gods rage ; For whether he will let me passe Or no , I 'm still as happy as I was .</p>
   <p>III . Though seas and land betwixt us both , Our faith and troth , Like separated soules , All time and space controules : Above the highest sphere wee meet , Unseene , unknowne , and greet as angels greet</p>
   <p>IV . So then we doe anticipate Our after-fate , And are alive i'th ’ skies , If thus our lips and eyes Can speake like spirits unconfin 'd In Heav'n , their earthy bodies left behind .</p>
   <p>&lt; 16. 1 > Of Henry and William Lawes an account may be found in Burney and Hawkins . Although the former ( H. Lawes ) set many of Lovelace 's pieces to music , only two occur in the AYRES AND DIALOGUES FOR ONE , TWO , AND THREE VOYCES , 1653-55-8 , folio .</p>
   <p>SONG . SET BY MR. JOHN LANIERE . TO LUCASTA . GOING TO THE WARRES .</p>
   <p>I . Tell me not , ( sweet ,) I am unkinde , That from the nunnerie Of thy chaste breast and quiet minde To warre and armes I flie .</p>
   <p>II . True : a new Mistresse now I chase , The first foe in the field ; And with a stronger faith imbrace A sword , a horse , a shield .</p>
   <p>III . Yet this inconstancy is such , As you too shall adore ; I could not love thee , dear , so much , Lov 'd I not Honour more .</p>
   <p>A PARADOX .</p>
   <p>I. Tis true the beauteous Starre &lt; 17. 1 > To which I first did bow Burnt quicker , brighter far , Than that which leads me now ; Which shines with more delight , For gazing on that light So long , neere lost my sight .</p>
   <p>II . Through foul we follow faire , For had the world one face , And earth been bright as ayre , We had knowne neither place . Indians smell not their neast ; A Swisse or Finne tastes best The spices of the East .&lt; 17. 2 ></p>
   <p>III . So from the glorious Sunne Who to his height hath got , With what delight we runne To some black cave or grot ! And , heav'nly Sydney you Twice read , had rather view Some odde romance so new .</p>
   <p>IV . The god , that constant keepes Unto his deities , Is poore in joyes , and sleepes Imprison 'd in the skies . This knew the wisest , who From Juno stole , below To love a bear or cow .</p>

   <p>SONG . SET BY MR. HENRY LAWES . TO AMARANTHA ;&lt; 18. 1 > THAT SHE WOULD DISHEVELL HER HAIRE .</p>
   <p>I. Amarantha sweet and faire , Ah brade &lt; 18. 2 > no more that shining haire ! As my curious hand or eye , Hovering round thee , let it flye .</p>
   <p>II . Let it flye as unconfin 'd As it 's calme ravisher , the winde , Who hath left his darling , th ’ East , To wanton o 're that &lt; 18. 3 > spicie neast .</p>
   <p>III . Ev'ry tresse must be confest : But neatly tangled at the best ; Like a clue of golden thread , Most excellently ravelled .</p>
   <p>IV . Doe not then winde up that light In ribands , and o'erhYpppHeNcloud in night , Like the sun in 's early ray ; But shake your head , and scatter day .</p>
   <p>V. See , ‘ tis broke ! within this grove , The bower and the walkes of love , Weary lye we downe and rest , And fanne each other 's panting breast .</p>
   <p>VI . Heere wee 'll strippe and coole our fire , In creame below , in milk-baths &lt; 18. 4 > higher : And when all wells are drawne dry , I 'll drink a teare out of thine eye .</p>
   <p>VII . Which our very joys shall leave , That sorrowes thus we can deceive ; Or our very sorrowes weepe , That joyes so ripe so little keepe .</p>
   <p>&lt; 18. 1 > A portion of this song is printed , with a few orthographical variations , in the AYRES AND DIALOGUES , part i . 1653 ; and it is also found in Cotgrave 's WITS INTERPRETER , 1655 , where it is called “ Amarantha counselled . ” Cotgrave used the text of Lawes , and only gives that part of the production which he found in AYRES AND DIALOGUES .</p>

   <p>SONNET . SET BY MR. HUDSON .</p>
   <p>I. Depose your finger of that ring , And crowne mine with't awhile ; Now I restor't . Pray , dos it bring Back with it more of soile ? Or shines it not as innocent , As honest , as before ‘ twas lent ?</p>
   <p>II . So then inrich me with that treasure , ‘ Twill but increase your store , And please me ( faire one ) with that pleasure Must please you still the more . Not to save others is a curse The blackest , when y'are ne 're the worse .</p>
   <p>ODE . SET BY DR. JOHN WILSON .&lt; 19. 1 > TO LUCASTA . THE ROSE .</p>
   <p>I . Sweet serene skye-like flower , Haste to adorn her bower ; From thy long clowdy bed Shoot forth thy damaske &lt; 19. 2 > head .</p>
   <p>II . New-startled blush of FLORA ! The griefe of pale AURORA , Who will contest no more , Haste , haste , to strowe her floore .</p>
   <p>III . Vermilion ball , that 's given From lip to lip in Heaven ; Loves couches cover-led , Haste , haste , to make her bed .</p>
   <p>IV . Dear offspring of pleas 'd VENUS , And jollie plumpe SILENUS ; Haste , haste , to decke the haire , Of th ’ only sweetly faire .</p>
   <p>V. See ! rosie is her bower , Her floore is all this flower ; Her bed a rosie nest By a bed of roses prest .</p>
   <p>VI . But early as she dresses , Why fly you her bright tresses ? Ah ! I have found , I feare ; Because her cheekes are neere .</p>
   <p>&lt; 19. 1 > Dr. John Wilson was a native of Feversham in Kent , a gentleman of Charles the First 's chapel , and chamber-musician to his majesty . For an account of his works , see Burney 's HISTORY OF MUSIC , vol . iii . pp . 399-400 , or Hawkins ’ HISTORY OF MUSIC , iii . 57 , where a portrait of Wilson , taken from the original painting , will be found . Wood , author of the FASTI and ATHENAE , says that he was in his time , “ the best at the lute in all England . ” Herrick , in his HESPERIDES , 1648 , has these lines in reference to Henry Lawes :—</p>
   <p>“ Then if thy voice commingle with the string , I hear in thee the rare Laniere to sing , OR CURIOUS WILSON . ”</p>

   <p>LOVE CONQUER 'D . A SONG . SET BY MR. HENRY LAWES .</p>
   <p>I . The childish god of love did sweare Thus : By my awfull bow and quiver , Yon ’ weeping , kissing , smiling pair , I'le scatter all their vowes i ’ th ’ ayr , And their knit imbraces shiver .</p>
   <p>II . Up then to th ’ head with his best art Full of spite and envy blowne , At her constant marble heart , He drawes his swiftest surest dart , Which bounded back , and hit his owne .</p>
   <p>III . Now the prince of fires burnes ; Flames in the luster of her eyes ; Triumphant she , refuses , scornes ; He submits , adores and mournes , And is his votresse sacrifice .</p>
   <p>IV . Foolish boy ! resolve me now What ‘ tis to sigh and not be heard ? He weeping kneel 'd , and made a vow : The world shall love as yon ’ fast two ; So on his sing 'd wings up he steer 'd .</p>
   <p>A LOOSE SARABAND . SET BY MR. HENRY LAWES .</p>
   <p>I. Ah me ! the little tyrant theefe ! As once my heart was playing , He snatcht it up and flew away , Laughing at all my praying .</p>
   <p>II . Proud of his purchase ,&lt; 20. 1 > he surveys And curiously sounds it , And though he sees it full of wounds , Cruel one , still &lt; 20. 2 > he wounds it .</p>
   <p>III . And now this heart is all his sport , Which as a ball he boundeth From hand to breast , from breast to lip , And all its &lt; 20. 3 > rest confoundeth .</p>
   <p>IV . Then as a top he sets it up , And pitifully whips it ; Sometimes he cloathes it gay and fine , Then straight againe he strips it .</p>
   <p>V. He cover 'd it with false reliefe ,&lt; 20. 4 > Which gloriously show 'd it ; And for a morning-cushionet On 's mother he bestow 'd it .</p>
   <p>VI . Each day , with her small brazen stings , A thousand times she rac 'd it ; But then at night , bright with her gemmes , Once neere her breast she plac 'd it .</p>
   <p>VII . There warme it gan to throb and bleed ; She knew that smart , and grieved ; At length this poore condemned heart With these rich drugges repreeved .</p>
   <p>VIII . She washt the wound with a fresh teare , Which my LUCASTA dropped , And in the sleave &lt; 20. 5 > - silke of her haire ‘ Twas hard bound up and wrapped .</p>
   <p>IX . She proab 'd it with her constancie , And found no rancor nigh it ; Only the anger of her eye Had wrought some proud flesh by it .</p>
   <p>X . Then prest she narde in ev'ry veine , Which from her kisses trilled ; And with the balme heald all its paine , That from her hand distilled .</p>
   <p>XI . But yet this heart avoyds me still , Will not by me be owned ; But 's fled to its physitian 's breast ; There proudly sits inthroned .</p>
   <p>&lt; 20. 1 > Prize . It is not uncommonly used by the early dramatists in this sense ; but the verb TO PURCHASE is more usually found than the noun .</p>

   <p>I . Here , here , oh here ! EURIDICE , Here was she slaine ; Her soule ‘ still 'd through a veine : The gods knew lesse That time divinitie , Then ev'n , ev'n these Of brutishnesse .</p>
   <p>II . Oh ! could you view the melodie Of ev'ry grace , And musick of her face ,&lt; 21. 3 > You 'd drop a teare , Seeing more harmonie In her bright eye , Then now you heare .</p>
   <p>&lt; 21. 1 > By Orpheus we may perhaps understand Lovelace himself , and by Euridice , the lady whom he celebrates under the name of Lucasta . Grainger mentions ( BIOG . HIST . ii . 74 ) a portrait of Lovelace by Gaywood , in which he is represented as Orpheus . I have not seen it . The old poets were rather fond of likening themselves to this legendary personage , or of designating themselves his poetical children :—</p>

   <p>I . When I by thy faire shape did sweare , And mingled with each vowe a teare , I lov 'd , I lov 'd thee best , I swore as I profest . For all the while you lasted warme and pure , My oathes too did endure . But once turn 'd faithlesse to thy selfe and old , They then with thee incessantly &lt; 23. 1 > grew cold .</p>
   <p>II . I swore my selfe thy sacrifice By th ’ ebon bowes &lt; 23. 2 > that guard thine eyes , Which now are alter 'd white , And by the glorious light Of both those stars , which of &lt; 23. 3 > their spheres bereft , Only the gellie 's left . Then changed thus , no more I 'm bound to you , Then swearing to a saint that proves untrue .</p>

   <p>LUCASTA WEEPING . SONG . SET BY MR. JOHN LANEERE .</p>
   <p>I. Lucasta wept , and still the bright Inamour 'd god of day , With his soft handkercher of light , Kist the wet pearles away .</p>
   <p>II . But when her teares his heate or'ecame , In cloudes he quensht his beames , And griev 'd , wept out his eye of flame , So drowned her sad streames .</p>
   <p>III .&lt; 24. 1 > At this she smiled , when straight the sun Cleer 'd by her kinde desires ; And by her eyes reflexion Fast kindl 'd there his fires .</p>
   <p>&lt; 24. 1 > This stanza is not found in the printed copy of LUCASTA , 1649 , but it occurs in a MS. of this poem written , with many compositions by Lovelace and other poets , in a copy of Crashaw 's POEMS , 1648 , 12mo , a portion of which having been formed of the printer 's proof-sheets , some of the pages are printed only on one side , the reverse being covered with MSS . poems , among the rest with epigrams by MR. THOMAS FULLER ( about fifty in number ) . There can be little doubt , from the character of the majority of these little poems , that by “ Mr. Thomas Fuller ” we may understand the church-historian .</p>
   <p>TO LUCASTA . FROM PRISON AN EPODE .&lt; 25. 1 ></p>
   <p>I . Long in thy shackels , liberty I ask not from these walls , but thee ; Left for awhile anothers bride , To fancy all the world beside .</p>
   <p>II . Yet e 're I doe begin to love , See , how I all my objects prove ; Then my free soule to that confine , ‘ Twere possible I might call mine .</p>
   <p>III . First I would be in love with PEACE , And her rich swelling breasts increase ; But how , alas ! how may that be , Despising earth , she will love me ?</p>
   <p>IV . Faine would I be in love with WAR , As my deare just avenging star ; But War is lov 'd so ev'rywhere , Ev'n he disdaines a lodging here .</p>
   <p>V. Thee and thy wounds I would bemoane , Faire thorough-shot RELIGION ; But he lives only that kills thee , And who so bindes thy hands , is free .</p>
   <p>VI . I would love a PARLIAMENT As a maine prop from Heav'n sent ; But ah ! who 's he , that would be wedded To th ’ fairest body that 's beheaded ?</p>
   <p>VII . Next would I court my LIBERTY , And then my birth-right , PROPERTY ; But can that be , when it is knowne , There 's nothing you can call your owne ?</p>
   <p>VIII . A REFORMATION I would have , As for our griefes a SOV'RAIGNE salve ; That is , a cleansing of each wheele Of state , that yet some rust doth feele .</p>
   <p>IX . But not a reformation so , As to reforme were to ore'throw , Like watches by unskilfull men Disjoynted , and set ill againe .</p>
   <p>X . The PUBLICK FAITH &lt; 25. 2 > I would adore , But she is banke-rupt of her store : Nor how to trust her can I see , For she that couzens all , must me .</p>
   <p>XI . Since then none of these can be Fit objects for my love and me ; What then remaines , but th ’ only spring Of all our loves and joyes , the King ?</p>
   <p>XII . He who , being the whole ball Of day on earth , lends it to all ; When seeking to ecclipse his right , Blinded we stand in our owne light .</p>
   <p>XIII . And now an universall mist Of error is spread or'e each breast , With such a fury edg 'd as is Not found in th ’ inwards of th ’ abysse .</p>
   <p>XIV . Oh , from thy glorious starry waine Dispense on me one sacred beame , To light me where I soone may see How to serve you , and you trust me !</p>
   <p>&lt; 25. 1 > This was written , perhaps , during the poet 's confinement in Peterhouse , to which he was committed a prisoner on his return from abroad in 1648 . At the date of its composition , there can be little doubt , from expressions in stanzas vi . and xii . that the fortunes of Charles I. were at their lowest ebb , and it may be assigned without much risk of error to the end of 1648 .</p>

   <p>LUCASTA 'S FANNE , WITH A LOOKING-GLASSE IN IT .&lt; 26. 1 ></p>
   <p>I. Eastrich !&lt; 26. 2 > thou featherd foole , and easie prey , That larger sailes to thy broad vessell needst ; Snakes through thy guttur-neck hisse all the day , Then on thy iron messe at supper feedst .&lt; 26. 3 ></p>
   <p>II . O what a glorious transmigration From this to so divine an edifice Hast thou straight made ! heere &lt; 26. 4 > from a winged stone Transform 'd into a bird of paradice !</p>
   <p>III . Now doe thy plumes for hiew and luster vie With th ’ arch of heav'n that triumphs or'e past wet , And in a rich enamel 'd pinion lye With saphyres , amethists and opalls set .</p>
   <p>IV . Sometime they wing her side ,&lt; 26. 5 > &lt; thee > strive to drown The day 's eyes piercing beames , whose am'rous heat Sollicites still , ‘ till with this shield of downe From her brave face his glowing fires are beat .</p>
   <p>V. But whilst a plumy curtaine she doth draw , A chrystall mirror sparkles in thy breast , In which her fresh aspect when as she saw , And then her foe &lt; 26. 6 > retired to the west .</p>
   <p>VI . Deare engine , that oth ’ sun got'st me the day , ‘ Spite of his hot assaults mad'st him retreat ! No wind ( said she ) dare with thee henceforth play But mine own breath to coole the tyrants heat .</p>
   <p>VII . My lively shade thou ever shalt retaine In thy inclosed feather-framed glasse , And but unto our selves to all remaine Invisible , thou feature of this face !</p>
   <p>VIII . So said , her sad swaine over-heard and cried : Yee Gods ! for faith unstaind this a reward ! Feathers and glasse t'outweigh my vertue tryed ! Ah ! show their empty strength ! the gods accord .</p>
   <p>IX . Now fall'n the brittle favourite lyes and burst ! Amas 'd LUCASTA weepes , repents and flies To her ALEXIS , vowes her selfe acurst , If hence she dresse her selfe but in his eyes .</p>
   <p>&lt; 26. 1 > This adaptation of the fan to the purposes of a mirror , now so common , was , as we here are told , familiar to the ladies of Lovelace 's time . Mr. Fairholt , in his COSTUME IN ENGLAND , 1846 , p. 496 , describes many various forms which were given at different periods to this article of use and ornament ; but the present passage in LUCASTA appears to have escaped his notice .</p>
   <p>&lt; 26. 2 > Ostrich . Lyly , in his EUPHUES , 1579 , sig . c 4 , has ESTRIDGE . The fan here described was composed of ostrich-feathers set with precious stones .</p>
   <p>&lt; 26. 3 > In allusion to the digestive powers of this bird .</p>
   <p>&lt; 26. 4 > Original reads NEERE .</p>
   <p>&lt; 26. 5 > The poet means that Lucasta , when she did not require her fan for immediate use , wore it suspended at her side or from her girdle .</p>
   <p>&lt; 26. 6 > The sun .</p>
   <p>LUCASTA , TAKING THE WATERS AT TUNBRIDGE .&lt; 27. 1 ></p>
   <p>I. Yee happy floods ! that now must passe The sacred conduicts of her wombe , Smooth and transparent as your face , When you are deafe , and windes are dumbe .</p>
   <p>II . Be proud ! and if your waters be Foul 'd with a counterfeyted teare , Or some false sigh hath stained yee , Haste , and be purified there .</p>
   <p>III . And when her rosie gates y'have trac 'd , Continue yet some Orient wet , ‘ Till , turn 'd into a gemme , y'are plac 'd Like diamonds with rubies set .</p>
   <p>IV . Yee drops , that dew th ’ Arabian bowers , Tell me , did you e 're smell or view On any leafe of all your flowers Soe sweet a sent , so rich a hiew ?</p>
   <p>V. But as through th ’ Organs of her breath You trickle wantonly , beware : Ambitious Seas in their just death As well as Lovers , must have share .</p>
   <p>VI . And see ! you boyle as well as I ; You , that to coole her did aspire , Now troubled and neglected lye , Nor can your selves quench your owne fire .</p>
   <p>VII . Yet still be happy in the thought , That in so small a time as this , Through all the Heavens you were brought Of Vertue , Honour , Love and Blisse .</p>
   <p>&lt; 27. 1 > From this it might be conjectured , though the ground for doing so would be very slight , that LUCASTA was a native of Kent or of one of the adjoining shires ; but against this supposition we have to set the circumstance that elsewhere this lady is called a “ northern star . ”</p>
   <p>TO LUCASTA . ODE LYRICK .</p>
   <p>I. Ah LUCASTA , why so bright ? Spread with early streaked light ! If still vailed from our sight , What is't but eternall night ?</p>
   <p>II . Ah LUCASTA , why so chaste ? With that vigour , ripenes grac't , Not to be by Man imbrac't Makes that Royall coyne imbace't , And this golden Orchard waste !</p>
   <p>III . Ah LUCASTA , why so great , That thy crammed coffers sweat ? Yet not owner of a seat May shelter you from Natures heat , And your earthly joyes compleat .</p>
   <p>IV . Ah Lucasta , why so good ? Blest with an unstained flood Flowing both through soule and blood ; If it be not understood , ‘ Tis a Diamond in mud .</p>
   <p>V. LUCASTA ! stay ! why dost thou flye ? Thou art not bright but to the eye , Nor chaste but in the mariage-tye , Nor great but in this treasurie , Nor good but in that sanctitie .</p>
   <p>VI . Harder then the Orient stone , Like an apparition , Or as a pale shadow gone , Dumbe and deafe she hence is flowne .</p>
   <p>VII . Then receive this equall dombe : Virgins , strow no teare or bloome , No one dig the Parian wombe ; Raise her marble heart i'th ’ roome , And ‘ tis both her coarse and tombe .</p>
   <p>LUCASTA PAYING HER OBSEQUIES TO THE CHAST MEMORY OF MY DEAREST COSIN MRS. BOWES BARNE [ S ] .&lt; 28. 1 ></p>
   <p>I . See ! what an undisturbed teare She weepes for her last sleepe ; But , viewing her , straight wak 'd a Star , She weepes that she did weepe .</p>
   <p>II . Griefe ne 're before did tyranize On th ’ honour of that brow , And at the wheeles of her brave eyes Was captive led til now .</p>
   <p>III . Thus , for a saints apostacy The unimagin 'd woes And sorrowes of the Hierarchy None but an angel knowes .</p>
   <p>IV . Thus , for lost soules recovery The clapping of all wings And triumphs of this victory None but an angel sings .</p>
   <p>V. So none but she knows to bemone This equal virgins fate , None but LUCASTA can her crowne Of glory celebrate .</p>
   <p>VI . Then dart on me ( CHAST LIGHT )&lt; 28. 2 > one ray , By which I may discry Thy joy cleare through this cloudy day To dresse my sorrow by .</p>

   <p>LUCASTA 'S WORLD . EPODE .</p>
   <p>I . Cold as the breath of winds that blow To silver shot descending snow , Lucasta sigh't ;&lt; 30. 1 > when she did close The world in frosty chaines ! And then a frowne to rubies frose The blood boyl 'd in our veines : Yet cooled not the heat her sphere Of beauties first had kindled there .</p>
   <p>II . Then mov 'd , and with a suddaine flame Impatient to melt all againe , Straight from her eyes she lightning hurl 'd , And earth in ashes mournes ; The sun his blaze denies the world , And in her luster burnes : Yet warmed not the hearts , her nice Disdaine had first congeal 'd to ice .</p>
   <p>III . And now her teares nor griev 'd desire Can quench this raging , pleasing fire ; Fate but one way allowes ; behold Her smiles ’ divinity ! They fann 'd this heat , and thaw 'd that cold , So fram 'd up a new sky . Thus earth , from flames and ice repreev 'd , E 're since hath in her sun-shine liv 'd .</p>
   <p>&lt; 30. 1 > Original reads SIGHT .</p>
   <p>THE APOSTACY OF ONE , AND BUT ONE LADY .</p>
   <p>I . That frantick errour I adore , And am confirm 'd the earth turns round ; Now satisfied o 're and o 're , As rowling waves , so flowes the ground , And as her neighbour reels the shore : Finde such a woman says she loves ; She 's that fixt heav'n , which never moves .</p>
   <p>II . In marble , steele , or porphyrie , Who carves or stampes his armes or face , Lookes it by rust or storme must dye : This womans love no time can raze , Hardned like ice in the sun 's eye , Or your reflection in a glasse , Which keepes possession , though you passe .</p>
   <p>III . We not behold a watches hand To stir , nor plants or flowers to grow ; Must we infer that this doth stand , And therefore , that those do not blow ? This she acts calmer , like Heav'ns brand , The stedfast lightning , slow loves dart , She kils , but ere we feele the smart .</p>
   <p>IV . Oh , she is constant as the winde , That revels in an ev'nings aire ! Certaine as wayes unto the blinde , More reall then her flatt'ries are ; Gentle as chaines that honour binde , More faithfull then an Hebrew Jew , But as the divel not halfe so true .</p>

     <l n="41">Into the garden is she come ,</l>
     <l n="42">Love and delight 's Elisium ;</l>
     <l n="43">If ever earth show 'd all her store ,</l>
     <l n="44">View her discolourd budding floore ;</l>

   <p>&lt; 35. 1 > This expression has reference to the old practice of drinking beer and wine out of very high glasses , with divisions marked on them . A yard of ale is even now a well understood term : nor is the custom itself out of date , since in some parts of the country one is asked to take , not a glass , but A YARD . The ell was of course , strictly speaking , a larger measure than a yard ; but it was often employed as a mere synonyme or equivalent . Thus , in MAROCCUS EXTATICUS , 1595 , Bankes says :— “ Measure , Marocco , nay , nay , they that take up commodities make no difference for measure between a Flemish elle and an English yard . ”</p>
   <p>&lt; 35. 2 > In the new edition of Nares ( 1859 ) , this very passage is quoted to illustrate the meaning of the word , which is defined rather vaguely to be A CASK . Obviously the word signifies something of the kind , but the explanation does not at all satisfy me . I suspect that a flute OF CANARY was so called from the cask having several vent-holes , in the same way that the French call a lamprey FLEUTE D'ALEMAN from the fish having little holes in the upper part of its body .</p>
   <p>&lt; 35. 3 > Forsyth , in his ANTIQUARY 'S PORTFOLIO , 1825 , mentions certain “ glutton-feasts , ” which used formerly to be celebrated periodically in honour of the Virgin ; perhaps the pasties used on these occasions were thence christened PASTIES-MARY .</p>
   <p>&lt; 35. 4 > Venison pies or pasties were the most favourite dish in this country in former times ; innumerable illustrations might be furnished of the high esteem in which this description of viand was held by our ancestors , who regarded it as a thoroughly English luxury . The anonymous author of HORAE SUBSECIVAE , 1620 , p. 38 ( this volume is supposed to have been written by Giles Brydges , Lord Chandos ) , describes an affected Englishman who has been travelling on the Continent , as “ sweating at the sight of a pasty of venison , ” and as “ swearing that the only delicacies be mushrooms , or CAVIARE , or snayles . ”</p>

   <p>TO ELLINDA . VPON HIS LATE RECOVERY . A PARADOX .</p>
   <p>I . How I grieve that I am well ! All my health was in my sicknes , Go then , Destiny , and tell , Very death is in this quicknes .</p>
   <p>II . Such a fate rules over me , That I glory when I languish , And do blesse the remedy , That doth feed , not quench my anguish .</p>
   <p>III . ‘ Twas a gentle warmth that ceas 'd In the vizard of a feavor ; But I feare now I am eas 'd All the flames , since I must leave her .</p>
   <p>IV . Joyes , though witherd , circled me , When unto her voice inured Like those who , by harmony , Only can be throughly cured .</p>
   <p>V. Sweet , sure , was that malady , Whilst the pleasant angel hover 'd , Which ceasing they are all , as I , Angry that they are recover 'd .</p>
   <p>VI . And as men in hospitals , That are maim 'd , are lodg 'd and dined ; But when once their danger fals , Ah th ’ are healed to be pined !</p>
   <p>VII . Fainting so , I might before Sometime have the leave to hand her , But lusty , am beat out of dore , And for Love compell 'd to wander .</p>
   <p>TO CHLOE , COURTING HER FOR HIS FRIEND .</p>
   <p>I. Chloe , behold ! againe I bowe : Againe possest , againe I woe ; From my heat hath taken fire Damas , noble youth , and fries ,&lt; 36. 1 > Gazing with one of mine eyes , Damas , halfe of me expires : Chloe , behold ! Our fate 's the same . Or make me cinders too , or quench his flame</p>
   <p>II . I 'd not be King , unlesse there sate Lesse lords that shar 'd with me in state Who , by their cheaper coronets , know , What glories from my diadem flow : Its use and rate &lt; 36. 2 > values the gem : Pearles in their shells have no esteem ; And , I being sun within thy sphere , ‘ Tis my chiefe beauty thinner lights shine there .</p>
   <p>III . The Us'rer heaps unto his store By seeing others praise it more ; Who not for gaine or want doth covet , But , ‘ cause another loves , doth love it : Thus gluttons cloy 'd afresh invite Their gusts from some new appetite ; And after cloth remov 'd , and meate , Fall too againe by seeing others eate .</p>
   <p>&lt; 36. 1 > This is not unfrequently used in old writers in the sense of BURN :—</p>
   <p>“ But Lucilla , who now began to frie in the flames of love , all the company being departed , ” &amp; c .— Lyly 's EUPHUES , 1579 , sig . c v. verso .</p>

   <p>&lt; 36. 2 > The estimation in which it is held , its marketable worth .</p>
   <p>GRATIANA DAUNCING AND SINGING .</p>
   <p>I . See ! with what constant motion Even and glorious , as the sunne , Gratiana steeres that noble frame , Soft as her breast , sweet as her voyce , That gave each winding law and poyze , And swifter then the wings of Fame .</p>
   <p>II . She beat the happy pavement By such a starre-made firmament , Which now no more the roofe envies ; But swells up high with Atlas ev'n , Bearing the brighter , nobler Heav'n , And in her , all the Dieties .</p>
   <p>III . Each step trod out a lovers thought And the ambitious hopes he brought , Chain 'd to her brave feet with such arts , Such sweet command and gentle awe , As when she ceas 'd , we sighing saw The floore lay pav 'd with broken hearts .</p>
   <p>IV . So did she move : so did she sing : Like the harmonious spheres that bring Unto their rounds their musick 's ayd ; Which she performed such a way , As all th ’ inamour 'd world will say : The Graces daunced , and Apollo play 'd .</p>

   <p>II . The joyes of earth and ayre are thine intire , That with thy feet and wings dost hop and flye ; And when thy poppy workes , thou dost retire To thy carv 'd acorn-bed to lye .</p>
   <p>III . Up with the day , the Sun thou welcomst then , Sportst in the guilt plats &lt; 41. 5 > of his beames , And all these merry dayes mak'st merry men ,&lt; 41. 6 > Thy selfe , and melancholy streames .</p>
   <p>IV . But ah , the sickle ! golden eares are cropt ; CERES and BACCHUS bid good-night ; Sharpe frosty fingers all your flowrs have topt , And what sithes spar 'd , winds shave off quite .</p>
   <p>V. Poore verdant foole ! and now green ice , thy joys Large and as lasting as thy peirch &lt; 41. 7 > of grasse , Bid us lay in ‘ gainst winter raine , and poize Their flouds with an o'erflowing glasse .</p>
   <p>VI . Thou best of men and friends ? we will create A genuine summer in each others breast ; And spite of this cold Time and frosen Fate , Thaw us a warme seate to our rest .</p>
   <p>VII . Our sacred harthes shall burne eternally As vestal flames ; the North-wind , he Shall strike his frost-stretch 'd winges , dissolve and flye This Aetna in epitome .</p>
   <p>VIII . Dropping December shall come weeping in , Bewayle th ’ usurping of his raigne ; But when in show'rs of old Greeke &lt; 41. 8 > we beginne , Shall crie , he hath his crowne againe !</p>
   <p>IX . Night as cleare Hesper shall our tapers whip From the light casements , where we play , And the darke hagge from her black mantle strip , And sticke there everlasting day .</p>

   <p>&lt; 41. 1 > Charles Cotton the elder , father of the poet . He died in 1658 . This poem is extracted in CENSURA LITERARIA , ix . 352 , as a favourable specimen of Lovelace 's poetical genius . The text is manifestly corrupt , but I have endeavoured to amend it . In Elton 's SPECIMENS OF CLASSIC POETS , 1814 , i . 148 , is a translation of Anacreon 's Address to the Cicada , or Tree-Locust ( Lovelace 's grasshopper ? ) , which is superior to the modern poem , being less prolix , and more natural in its manner . In all Lovelace 's longer pieces there are too many obscure and feeble conceits , and too many evidences of a leaning to the metaphysical and antithetical school of poetry .</p>

   <p>&lt; 45. 1 > Mr ., afterwards Sir Peter , Lely . He was frequently called Lilly , or Lilley , by his contemporaries , and Lilley is Pepys ’ spelling . “ At Lord Northumberland 's , at Sion , is a remarkable picture of King Charles I , holding a letter directed ‘ au roi monseigneur , ’ and the Duke of York , aet . 14 , presenting a penknife to him to cut the strings . It was drawn at Hampton Court , when the King was last there , by Mr. Lely , who was earnestly recommended to him . I should have taken it for the hand of Fuller or Dobson . It is certainly very unlike Sir Peter 's latter manner , and is stronger than his former . The King has none of the melancholy grace which Vandyck alone , of all his painters , always gave him . It has a sterner countenance , and expressive of the tempests he had experienced . ” — Walpole 's ANECDOTES OF PAINTING IN ENGLAND , ed . 1862 , p. 443-4 .</p>

   <p>TO ALTHEA . FROM PRISON . SONG . SET BY DR. JOHN WILSON .&lt; 50. 1 ></p>
   <p>I . When love with unconfined wings Hovers within my gates ; And my divine ALTHEA brings To whisper at the grates ; When I lye tangled in her haire ,&lt; 50. 2 > And fetterd to her eye ,&lt; 50. 3 > The birds ,&lt; 50. 4 > that wanton in the aire , Know no such liberty .</p>
   <p>II . When flowing cups run swiftly round With no allaying THAMES , Our carelesse heads with roses bound , Our hearts with loyal flames ; When thirsty griefe in wine we steepe , When healths and draughts go free , Fishes , that tipple in the deepe , Know no such libertie .</p>
   <p>III . When ( like committed linnets &lt; 50. 5 >) I With shriller throat shall sing The sweetnes , mercy , majesty , And glories of my King . When I shall voyce aloud , how good He is , how great should be , Inlarged winds , that curle the flood , Know no such liberty .</p>
   <p>IV . Stone walls doe not a prison make , Nor iron bars a cage ; Mindes innocent and quiet take That for an hermitage ; If I have freedome in my love , And in my soule am free , Angels alone that sore above Enjoy such liberty .</p>
   <p>&lt; 50. 1 > The first stanza of this famous song is harmonized in CHEERFULL AYRES OR BALLADS : FIRST COMPOSED FOR ONE SINGLE VOICE , AND SINCE SET FOR THREE VOICES . By John Wilson , Dr. in Music , Professor of the same in the University of Oxford . Oxford , 1660 ( Sept. 20 , 1659 ) , 4to . p. 10 . I have sometimes thought that , when Lovelace composed this production , he had in his recollection some of the sentiments in Wither 's SHEPHERDS HUNTING , 1615 . See , more particularly , the sonnet ( at p. 248 of Mr. Gutch 's Bristol edition ) commencing :—</p>

   <p>&lt; 50. 4 > Original reads GODS ; the present word is substituted in accordance with a MS. copy of the song printed by the late Dr. Bliss , in his edition of Woods ATHENAE . If Dr. Bliss had been aware of the extraordinary corruptions under which the text of LUCASTA laboured , he would have had less hesitation in adopting BIRDS as the true reading . The “ Song to Althea , ” is a favourable specimen of the class of composition to which it belongs ; but I fear that it has been over-estimated .</p>
   <p>&lt; 50. 5 > Percy very unnecessarily altered LIKE COMMITTED LINNETS to LINNET-LIKE CONFINED ( Percy 's RELIQUES , ii . 247 ; Moxon 's ed . ) Ellis ( SPECIMENS OF EARLY ENGLISH POETS , ed . 1801 , iii . 252 ) says that this latter reading is “ more intelligible . ” It is not , however , either what Lovelace wrote , or what ( it may be presumed ) he intended to write , and nothing , it would seem , can be clearer than the passage as it stands , COMMITTED signifying , in fact , nothing more than CONFINED . It is fortunate for the lovers of early English literature that Bp . Percy had comparatively little to do with it .

   <p>I . Now the peace is made at the foes rate ,&lt; 51. 3 > Whilst men of armes to kettles their old helmes translate , And drinke in caskes of honourable plate . In ev'ry hand [ let ] a cup be found , That from all hearts a health may sound To GORING ! to GORING ! see ‘ t goe round .</p>
   <p>II . He whose glories shine so brave and high , That captive they in triumph leade each care and eye , Claiming uncombated the victorie , And from the earth to heav'n rebound , Fixt there eternall as this round : To GORING ! to GORING ! see him crown 'd .</p>
   <p>III . To his lovely bride , in love with scars , Whose eyes wound deepe in peace , as doth his sword in wars ; They shortly must depose the Queen of Stars : Her cheekes the morning blushes give , And the benighted world repreeve ; To LETTICE ! to LETTICE ! let her live .</p>
   <p>IV . Give me scorching heat , thy heat , dry Sun , That to this payre I may drinke off an ocean : Yet leave my grateful thirst unquensht , undone ; Or a full bowle of heav'nly wine , In which dissolved stars should shine , To the couple ! to the couple ! th ’ are divine .</p>

   <p>&lt; 51. 2 > A LA CHABOT was a French dance tune , christened after the admiral of that name , in the same manner as A LA BOURBON , mentioned elsewhere in LUCASTA , derived its title from another celebrated person . Those who have any acquaintance with the history of early English music need not to be informed that it was formerly the practice of our own composers to seek the patronage of the gentlemen and ladies about the Court for their works , and to identify their names with them .

   <p>SIR THOMAS WORTLEY 'S SONNET ANSWERED .</p>
   <p>[ THE SONNET .</p>
   <p>I . No more Thou little winged archer , now no more As heretofore , Thou maist pretend within my breast to bide , No more , Since cruell Death of dearest LYNDAMORE Hath me depriv 'd , I bid adieu to love , and all the world beside .</p>
   <p>II . Go , go ; Lay by thy quiver and unbend thy bow Poore sillie foe , Thou spend'st thy shafts but at my breast in vain , Since Death My heart hath with a fatall icie deart Already slain , Thou canst not ever hope to warme her wound , Or wound it o 're againe . ]</p>
   <p>THE ANSWER .</p>
   <p>I. Againe , Thou witty cruell wanton , now againe , Through ev'ry veine , Hurle all your lightning , and strike ev'ry dart , Againe , Before I feele this pleasing , pleasing paine . I have no heart , Nor can I live but sweetly murder 'd with So deare , so deare a smart .</p>
   <p>II . Then flye , And kindle all your torches at her eye , To make me dye Her martyr , and put on my roabe of flame : So I , Advanced on my blazing wings on high , In death became Inthroan 'd a starre , and ornament unto Her glorious , glorious name .</p>
   <p>A GUILTLESSE LADY IMPRISONED : AFTER PENANCED . SONG . SET BY MR. WILLIAM LAWES .</p>
   <p>I. Heark , faire one , how what e 're here is Doth laugh and sing at thy distresse ; Not out of hate to thy reliefe , But joy t ’ enjoy thee , though in griefe .</p>
   <p>II . See ! that which chaynes you , you chaine here ; The prison is thy prisoner ; How much thy jaylor 's keeper art ! He bindes your hands , but you his heart .</p>
   <p>III . The gyves to rase so smooth a skin , Are so unto themselves within ; But , blest to kisse so fayre an arme , Haste to be happy with that harme ;</p>
   <p>IV . And play about thy wanton wrist , As if in them thou so wert drest ; But if too rough , too hard they presse , Oh , they but closely , closely kisse .</p>
   <p>V. And as thy bare feet blesse the way , The people doe not mock , but pray , And call thee , as amas 'd they run Instead of prostitute , a nun .</p>
   <p>VI . The merry torch burnes with desire To kindle the eternall fire , And lightly daunces in thine eyes To tunes of epithalamies .</p>
   <p>VII . The sheet 's ty 'd ever to thy wast , How thankfull to be so imbrac't ! And see ! thy very very bonds Are bound to thee , to binde such hands .</p>
   <p>TO HIS DEARE BROTHER COLONEL F. L. IMMODERATELY MOURNING MY BROTHERS &lt; 52. 1 > UNTIMELY DEATH AT CARMARTHEN .</p>
   <p>I . If teares could wash the ill away , A pearle for each wet bead I 'd pay ; But as dew 'd corne the fuller growes , So water 'd eyes but swell our woes .</p>
   <p>II . One drop another cals , which still ( Griefe adding fuell ) doth distill ; Too fruitfull of her selfe is anguish , We need no cherishing to languish .</p>
   <p>III . Coward fate degen'rate man Like little children uses , when He whips us first , untill we weepe , Then , ‘ cause we still a weeping keepe .</p>
   <p>IV . Then from thy firme selfe never swerve ; Teares fat the griefe that they should sterve ; Iron decrees of destinie Are ner'e wipe't out with a wet eye .</p>
   <p>V. But this way you may gaine the field , Oppose but sorrow , and ‘ twill yield ; One gallant thorough-made resolve Doth starry influence dissolve .</p>

   <p>&lt; 53. 1 > “ Madam A. L . ” is not in MS. copy . “ The Lady A. L . ” and “ Madam A. L . ” may very probably be two different persons : for Carew in his Poems ( edit . 1651 , 8vo . p. 2 ) has a piece “ To A. L .; Persuasions to Love , ” and it is possible that the A. L. of Carew , and the A. L. mentioned above , are identical . The following poem is printed in Durfey 's PILLS TO PURGE MELANCHOLY , v. 120 , but whether it was written by Lovelace , and addressed to the same lady , whom he represents above as requesting him to join her in a song , or whether it was the production of another pen , I cannot at all decide . It is not particularly unlike the style of the author of LUCASTA . At all events , I am not aware that it has been appropriated by anybody else , and as I am reluctant to omit any piece which Lovelace is at all likely to have composed , I give these lines just as I find them in Durfey , where they are set to music :—</p>

   <p>VALIANT LOVE .</p>
   <p>I . Now fie upon that everlasting life ! I dye ! She hates ! Ah me ! It makes me mad ; As if love fir 'd his torch at a moist eye , Or with his joyes e 're crown 'd the sad . Oh , let me live and shout , when I fall on ; Let me ev'n triumph in the first attempt ! Loves duellist from conquest ‘ s not exempt , When his fair murdresse shall not gain one groan , And he expire ev'n in ovation .</p>
   <p>II . Let me make my approach , when I lye downe With counter-wrought and travers eyes ;&lt; 54. 1 > With peals of confidence batter the towne ; Had ever beggar yet the keyes ? No , I will vary stormes with sun and winde ; Be rough , and offer calme condition ; March in and pread ,&lt; 54. 2 > or starve the garrison . Let her make sallies hourely : yet I'le find ( Though all beat of ) shee 's to be undermin 'd .</p>
   <p>III . Then may it please your little excellence Of hearts t ’ ordaine , by sound of lips , That henceforth none in tears dare love comence ( Her thoughts ith ’ full , his , in th ’ eclipse ) ; On paine of having ‘ s launce broke on her bed , That he be branded all free beauties ’ slave , And his own hollow eyes be domb 'd his grave : Since in your hoast that coward nere was fed , Who to his prostrate ere was prostrated .</p>

   <p>II . Ye cloudy spark lights , whose vast multitude Of fires are harder to be found then view 'd , Waite on this star in her first magnitude .</p>
   <p>III . Calmely or roughly ! Ah , she shines too much ; That now I lye ( her influence is such ) , Chrusht with too strong a hand , or soft a touch .</p>
   <p>IV . Lovers , beware ! a certaine , double harme Waits your proud hopes , her looks al-killing charm Guarded by her as true victorious arme .</p>
   <p>V. Thus with her eyes brave Tamyris spake dread , Which when the kings dull breast not entered , Finding she could not looke , she strook him dead .</p>
   <p>&lt; 55. 1 > This word , though generally used in a bad sense by early writers , does not seem to bear in the present case any offensive meaning . The late editors of Nares quote a passage from one of Cowley 's ESSAYS , in which that writer seems to imply by the term merely a fine woman .</p>
   <p>Since the note at p. 133 &lt; i. e . note 55. 1 > was written , the following description by Aubrey ( LIVES , &amp; c ., ii . 332 ) , of a picture of the Lady Venetia Digby has fallen under my notice . “ Also , at Mr. Rose 's , a jeweller in Henrietta Street , in Covent Garden , is an excellent piece of hers , drawne after she was newly dead . She had a most lovely sweet-turned face , delicate darke browne haire . She had a perfect healthy constitution ; strong ; good skin ; well-proportioned ; inclining to a BONA-ROBA . ”</p>

   <p>&lt; 56. 4 > A RASCAL DEER was formerly a well-known term among sportsmen , signifying a lean beast , not worth pursuit . Thus in A C. MERY TALYS ( 1525 ) , No . 29 , we find :— “ [ they ] apoynted thys Welchman to stand still , and forbade him in any wyse to shote at no rascal dere , but to make sure of the greate male , and spare not . ” In the new edition of Nares , other and more recent examples of the employment of the term are given . But in the BOOK OF SAINT ALBANS , 1486 , RASCAL is used in the signification merely of a beast other than one of “ enchace . ”</p>

   <p>&lt; 60. 1 > All historical and genealogical works are deficient in minute information relative to the family of Charles I . Even in Anderson 's ROYAL GENEALOGIES , 1732 , and in the folio editions of Rapin and Tindal , these details are overlooked . At page 36 of his DESCENDANTS OF THE STUARTS , 1858 , Mr. Townend observes that two of the children of Charles I. died in infancy , and of these the Princesse Katherine , commemorated by Lovelace , was perhaps one . The present verses were originally printed in MUSARUM OXONIENSIUM CHARISTERIA , Oxon . 1638 , 4to , from which a few better readings have been obtained . With the exceptions mentioned in the notes , the variations of the earlier text from that found here are merely literal .</p>
   <p>P. 140 . PRINCESSE KATHERINE , BORNE , &amp; C ., IN ONE DAY . In Ellis 's ORIGINAL LETTERS , Second Series , iii . 265 , is printed a scrap from Harl . MS. 6988 , in the handwriting of the Princess Elizabeth , daughter of Charles I ., giving a list of the children of that prince by Henrietta Maria , with the dates of their birth . There mention is made of a Princess Katherine , born Jan. 29 , 1639 . 1639 is , I believe , a slip of the pen for 1637 ; that is to say , the princess was born on the 29th of January , 1637-8 . This discrepancy between the CHARISTERIA and the memorandum in Harl . MS. escaped Sir H. Ellis , who was possibly unaware of the existence of the former . For , unless a mistake is assumed on the part of the writer of the MS ., the existence of TWO Princesses Katherine must be granted .</p>

   <p>&lt; 61. 2 > There can be no doubt that Sidney 's ARCADIA was formerly as popular in its way among the readers of both sexes as Sir Richard Baker 's CHRONICLE appears to have been . The former was especially recommended to those who sought occasional relaxation from severer studies . See Higford 's INSTITUTIONS , 1658 , 8vo , p. 46-7 . In his poem of THE SURPRIZE , Cotton describes his nymph as reading the ARCADIA on the bank of a river —</p>
   <p>“ The happy OBJECT of her eye Was SIDNEY 'S living ARCADY : Whose amorous tale had so betrai 'd Desire in this all-lovely maid ; That , whilst her check a blush did warm , I read LOVES story in her form . ” POEMS ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS .

The verses here republished were originally prefixed to the first collected edition of Beaumont and Fletcher 's TRAGEDIES AND COMEDIES , 1647 , folio .

   <p>&lt; 63. 4 > An allusion to the HERCULES FURENS of Euripides . Lovelace had , no doubt , some tincture of Greek scholarship ( See Wood 's ATH . OX . ii . 466 ) ; but as to the extent of his acquirements in this direction , it is hard to speak with confidence . Among the books of Mr. Thomas Jolley , dispersed in 1853 , was a copy of Clenardus INSTITUTIONES GRAECAE LINGUAE , Lugd . Batav . 1626 , 8vo ., on the title of which was “ Richard Lovelace , 1630 , March 5 , ” supposed to be the autograph of the poet when a schoolboy .</p>

   <p>LOVE INTHRON 'D .</p>
   <p>ODE .</p>
   <p>I. Introth , I do my self perswade , That the wilde boy is grown a man , And all his childishnesse off laid , E 're since LUCASTA did his fires fan ; H ’ has left his apish jigs , And whipping hearts like gigs : For t ’ other day I heard him swear , That beauty should be crown 'd in honours chair .</p>
   <p>II . With what a true and heavenly state He doth his glorious darts dispence , Now cleans 'd from falsehood , blood and hate , And newly tipt with innocence ! Love Justice is become , And doth the cruel doome ; Reversed is the old decree ; Behold ! he sits inthron 'd with majestie .</p>
   <p>III . Inthroned in LUCASTA 'S eye , He doth our faith and hearts survey ; Then measures them by sympathy , And each to th ’ others breast convey ; Whilst to his altars now The frozen vestals bow , And strickt Diana too doth go A-hunting with his fear 'd , exchanged bow .</p>
   <p>IV . Th ’ imbracing seas and ambient air Now in his holy fires burn ; Fish couple , birds and beasts in pair Do their own sacrifices turn . This is a miracle , That might religion swell ; But she , that these and their god awes , Her crowned self submits to her own laws .</p>
   <p>HER MUFFE .</p>
   <p>I. Twas not for some calm blessing to deceive , Thou didst thy polish 'd hands in shagg 'd furs weave ; It were no blessing thus obtain 'd ; Thou rather would'st a curse have gain 'd , Then let thy warm driven snow be ever stain 'd .</p>
   <p>II . Not that you feared the discolo'ring cold Might alchymize their silver into gold ; Nor could your ten white nuns so sin , That you should thus pennance them in , Each in her coarse hair smock of discipline .</p>
   <p>III . Nor , Hero-like who , on their crest still wore A lyon , panther , leopard , or a bore , To looke their enemies in their herse , Thou would'st thy hand should deeper pierce , And , in its softness rough , appear more fierce .</p>
   <p>IV . No , no , LUCASTA , destiny decreed , That beasts to thee a sacrifice should bleed , And strip themselves to make you gay : For ne'r yet herald did display A coat , where SABLES upon ERMIN lay .</p>
   <p>V. This for lay-lovers , that must stand at dore , Salute the threshold , and admire no more ; But I , in my invention tough , Rate not this outward bliss enough , But still contemplate must the hidden muffe .</p>

   <p>&lt; 65. 1 > The following is a poet 's lecture to the ladies of his time on the long prevailing practice of wearing patches , in which it seems that Lucasta acquiesced :—</p>
   <p>BLACK PATCHES . VANITAS VANITATUM . LADIES turn conjurers , and can impart The hidden mystery of the black art , Black artificial patches do betray ; They more affect the works of night than day . The creature strives the Creator to disgrace , By patching that which is a perfect face : A little stain upon the purest dye Is both offensive to the heart and eye . Defile not then with spots that face of snow , Where the wise God His workmanship doth show , The light of nature and the light of grace Is the complexion for a lady 's face . FLAMMA SINE FUMO , by R. Watkyns , 1662 , p. 81 .</p>
   <p>In a poem entitled THE BURSSE OF REFORMATION , in praise of the New Exchange , printed in WIT RESTORED , 1658 , patches are enumerated among the wares of all sorts to be procured there :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Heer patches are of every cut ,</l>
     <l n="2">For pimples and for scars . ”</l>

     <l n="3">They were also used for rheum , as appears from a passage in</l>

   <p>ANOTHER .</p>
   <p>I . As I beheld a winter 's evening air , Curl 'd in her court-false-locks of living hair , Butter 'd with jessamine the sun left there .</p>
   <p>II . Galliard and clinquant she appear 'd to give , A serenade or ball to us that grieve , And teach us A LA MODE more gently live .</p>
   <p>III . But as a Moor , who to her cheeks prefers White spots , t ’ allure her black idolaters , Me thought she look 'd all ore-bepatch 'd with stars .</p>
   <p>IV . Like the dark front of some Ethiopian queen , Vailed all ore with gems of red , blew , green , Whose ugly night seem 'd masked with days skreen .</p>
   <p>V. Whilst the fond people offer 'd sacrifice To saphyrs , ‘ stead of veins and arteries , And bow 'd unto the diamonds , not her eyes .</p>
   <p>VI . Behold LUCASTA 'S face , how't glows like noon ! A sun intire is her complexion , And form 'd of one whole constellation .</p>
   <p>VII . So gently shining , so serene , so cleer , Her look doth universal Nature cheer ; Only a cloud or two hangs here and there .</p>
   <p>TO LUCASTA .</p>
   <p>I. I laugh and sing , but cannot tell Whether the folly o n't sounds well ; But then I groan , Methinks , in tune ; Whilst grief , despair and fear dance to the air Of my despised prayer .</p>
   <p>II . A pretty antick love does this , Then strikes a galliard with a kiss ; As in the end The chords they rend ; So you but with a touch from your fair hand Turn all to saraband .</p>
   <p>TO LUCASTA .</p>
   <p>I . Like to the sent'nel stars , I watch all night ; For still the grand round of your light And glorious breast Awake &lt; 66. 1 > in me an east : Nor will my rolling eyes ere know a west .</p>
   <p>II . Now on my down I 'm toss 'd as on a wave , And my repose is made my grave ; Fluttering I lye , Do beat my self and dye , But for a resurrection from your eye .</p>
   <p>III . Ah , my fair murdresse ! dost thou cruelly heal With various pains to make me well ? Then let me be Thy cut anatomie , And in each mangled part my heart you'l see .</p>
   <p>&lt; 66. 1 > Original has AWAKES .</p>
   <p>LUCASTA AT THE BATH .</p>
   <p>I. I ’ th ’ autumn of a summer 's day , When all the winds got leave to play , LUCASTA , that fair ship , is lanch 'd , And from its crust this almond blanch 'd .</p>
   <p>II . Blow then , unruly northwind , blow , ‘ Till in their holds your eyes you stow ; And swell your cheeks , bequeath chill death ; See ! she hath smil 'd thee out of breath .</p>
   <p>III . Court , gentle zephyr , court and fan Her softer breast 's carnation wan ; Your charming rhethorick of down Flyes scatter 'd from before her frown .</p>
   <p>IV . Say , my white water-lilly , say , How is't those warm streams break away , Cut by thy chast cold breast , which dwells Amidst them arm 'd in isicles ?</p>
   <p>V. And the hot floods , more raging grown , In flames of thee then in their own , In their distempers wildly glow , And kisse thy pillar of fix 'd snow .</p>
   <p>VI . No sulphur , through whose each blew vein The thick and lazy currents strein , Can cure the smarting nor the fell Blisters of love , wherewith they swell .</p>
   <p>VII . These great physicians of the blind , The lame , and fatal blains of Inde In every drop themselves now see Speckled with a new leprosie .</p>
   <p>VIII . As sick drinks are with old wine dash 'd , Foul waters too with spirits wash 'd , Thou greiv 'd , perchance , one tear let'st fall , Which straight did purifie them all .</p>
   <p>IX . And now is cleans 'd enough the flood , Which since runs cleare as doth thy blood ; Of the wet pearls uncrown thy hair , And mantle thee with ermin air .</p>
   <p>X. Lucasta , hail ! fair conqueresse Of fire , air , earth and seas ! Thou whom all kneel to , yet even thou Wilt unto love , thy captive , bow .</p>
   <p>THE ANT .&lt; 67. 1 ></p>
   <p>I. Forbear , thou great good husband , little ant ; A little respite from thy flood of sweat ! Thou , thine own horse and cart under this plant , Thy spacious tent , fan thy prodigious heat ; Down with thy double load of that one grain ! It is a granarie for all thy train .</p>
   <p>II . Cease , large example of wise thrift , awhile ( For thy example is become our law ) , And teach thy frowns a seasonable smile : So Cato sometimes the nak 'd Florals saw .&lt; 67. 2 > And thou , almighty foe , lay by thy sting , Whilst thy unpay 'd musicians , crickets , sing .</p>
   <p>III . LUCASTA , she that holy makes the day , And ‘ stills new life in fields of fueillemort ,&lt; 67. 3 > Hath back restor 'd their verdure with one ray , And with her eye bid all to play and sport , Ant , to work still ! age will thee truant call ; And to save now , th'art worse than prodigal .</p>
   <p>IV . Austere and cynick ! not one hour t ’ allow , To lose with pleasure , what thou gotst with pain ; But drive on sacred festivals thy plow , Tearing high-ways with thy ore-charged wain . Not all thy life-time one poor minute live , And thy ore-labour 'd bulk with mirth relieve ?</p>
   <p>V. Look up then , miserable ant , and spie Thy fatal foes , for breaking of their &lt; 67. 4 > law , Hov'ring above thee : Madam MARGARET PIE : And her fierce servant , meagre Sir JOHN DAW : Thy self and storehouse now they do store up , And thy whole harvest too within their crop .</p>
   <p>VI . Thus we unt [ h ] rifty thrive within earth 's tomb For some more rav'nous and ambitious jaw : The grain in th ’ ant 's , the ant &lt; 67. 5 > in the pie 's womb , The pie in th ’ hawk 's , the hawk &lt; 67. 6 > ith ’ eagle 's maw . So scattering to hord ‘ gainst a long day , Thinking to save all , we cast all away .</p>
   <p>&lt; 67. 1 > A writer in CENSURA LITERARIA , x . 292 ( first edit . ) — the late E. V. Utterson , Esq .— highly praises this little poem , and says that it is not unworthy of Cowper . I think it highly probable that the translation from Martial ( lib . vi . Ep . 15 ) , at the end of the present volume , was executed prior to the composition of these lines ; and that the latter were suggested by the former . Compare the beautiful description of the ant in the PROVERBS OF SOLOMON :— “ Go to the ant , thou sluggard ; consider her ways and be wise : which having no guide , overseer , or ruler , provideth her meat in the summer , and gathereth her food in the harvest .— PROVERBS , vi . 6-8 .</p>
   <p>In the poems of John Cleveland , 1669 , is a piece entitled “ Fuscara , or the Bee Errant , ” which is of a somewhat similar character , and is by no means a contemptible production , though spoiled by that LUES ALCHYMISTICA which disfigures so much of the poetry of Cleveland 's time . The abilities of Cleveland as a writer seem to have been underrated by posterity , in proportion to the undue praise lavished upon him by his contemporaries .</p>

   <p>SONG .</p>
   <p>I. Strive not , vain lover , to be fine ; Thy silk 's the silk-worm 's , and not thine : You lessen to a fly your mistriss ’ thought , To think it may be in a cobweb caught . What , though her thin transparent lawn Thy heart in a strong net hath drawn : Not all the arms the god of fire ere made Can the soft bulwarks of nak 'd love invade .</p>
   <p>II . Be truly fine , then , and yourself dress In her fair soul 's immac'late glass . Then by reflection you may have the bliss Perhaps to see what a true fineness is ; When all your gawderies will fit Those only that are poor in wit . She that a clinquant outside doth adore , Dotes on a gilded statue and no more .</p>

   <p>LOVE MADE IN THE FIRST AGE .</p>
   <p>TO CHLORIS .</p>
   <p>I . In the nativity of time , Chloris ! it was not thought a crime In direct Hebrew for to woe . Now wee make love , as all on fire , Ring retrograde our lowd desire , And court in English backward too .</p>
   <p>II . Thrice happy was that golden age , When complement was constru 'd rage , And fine words in the center hid ; When cursed NO stain 'd no maid 's blisse , And all discourse was summ 'd in YES , And nought forbad , but to forbid .</p>
   <p>III .&lt; 71. 1 > Love then unstinted love did sip , And cherries pluck 'd fresh from the lip , On cheeks and roses free he fed ; Lasses , like Autumne plums , did drop , And lads indifferently did drop A flower and a maiden-head .</p>
   <p>IV . Then unconfined each did tipple Wine from the bunch , milk from the nipple ; Paps tractable as udders were . Then equally the wholsome jellies Were squeez 'd from olive-trees and bellies : Nor suits of trespasse did they fear .</p>
   <p>V. A fragrant bank of strawberries , Diaper 'd with violets ’ eyes , Was table , table-cloth and fare ; No palace to the clouds did swell , Each humble princesse then did dwell In the Piazza of her hair .</p>
   <p>VI . Both broken faith and th ’ cause of it , All-damning gold , was damn 'd to th ’ pit ; Their troth seal 'd with a clasp and kisse , Lasted until that extreem day , In which they smil 'd their souls away , And in each other breath 'd new blisse .</p>
   <p>VII . Because no fault , there was no tear ; No grone did grate the granting ear , No false foul breath , their del'cat smell . No serpent kiss poyson 'd the tast , Each touch was naturally chast , And their mere Sense a Miracle .</p>
   <p>VIII . Naked as their own innocence , And unembroyder 'd from offence , They went , above poor riches , gay ; On softer than the cignet 's down , In beds they tumbled off their own : For each within the other lay .</p>
   <p>IX . Thus did they live : thus did they love , Repeating only joyes above , And angels were but with cloaths on , Which they would put off cheerfully , To bathe them in the Galaxie , Then gird them with the heavenly zone .</p>
   <p>X . Now , Chloris ! miserably crave The offer 'd blisse you would not have , Which evermore I must deny : Whilst ravish 'd with these noble dreams , And crowned with mine own soft beams , Injoying of my self I lye .</p>

   <p>&lt; 72. 1 > A portion of this little poem is quoted in Brand 's POPULAR ANTIQUITIES ( edit . 1849 , ii . 70 ) , as an illustration of the custom to which it refers . No second example of such an usage seems to have been known to Brand and his editors .</p>
   <p>P. 183 . TO A LADY WITH CHILDE THAT ASK'T AN OLD SHIRT . The custom to which the Poet here refers , was no doubt common in his time ; although the indefatigable Brand does not appear to have met with any illustration of it , except in LUCASTA . But since the note at p. 183 &lt; i. e . note 72. 1 > was written , the following passage in the old morality of THE MARRIAGE OF WIT AND WISDOM ( circa 1570 ) has come under my notice :—</p>
   <p>“ INDULGENCE [ to her son WIT ] . Well , yet before the goest , hold heare MY BLESSING IN A CLOUTE , WELL FARE THE MOTHER AT A NEEDE , Stand to thy tackling stout . ”</p>
   <p>The allusion is to the contemplated marriage of WIT to his betrothed , WISDOM .</p>
   <p>SONG .</p>
   <p>I . In mine one monument I lye , And in my self am buried ; Sure , the quick lightning of her eye Melted my soul ith ’ scabberd dead ; And now like some pale ghost I walk , And with another 's spirit talk .</p>
   <p>II . Nor can her beams a heat convey , That may my frozen bosome warm , Unless her smiles have pow'r , as they , That a cross charm can countercharm . But this is such a pleasing pain , I 'm loth to be alive again .</p>

   <p>II . What chains but are too light for me , should I Say that Lucasta in strange arms could lie ? Or that Castara &lt; 73. 2 > were impure ; Or Saccarisa 's &lt; 73. 3 > faith unsure ? That Chloris ’ love , as hair , Embrac 'd each en'mies air ; That all their good Ran in their blood ? ‘ Tis the same wrong th ’ unworthy to inthrone , As from her proper sphere t ’ have vertue thrown .</p>
   <p>III . That strange force on the ignoble hath renown ; As AURUM FULMINANS , it blows vice down . ‘ Twere better ( heavy one ) to crawl Forgot , then raised , trod on [ to ] fall . All your defections now Are not writ on your brow ; Odes to faults give A shame must live . When a fat mist we view , we coughing run ; But , that once meteor drawn , all cry : undone .</p>

   <p>THE DUELL .</p>
   <p>I . Love drunk , the other day , knockt at my brest , But I , alas ! was not within . My man , my ear , told me he came t ’ attest , That without cause h 'd boxed him , And battered the windows of mine eyes , And took my heart for one of 's nunneries .</p>
   <p>II . I wondred at the outrage safe return 'd , And stormed at the base affront ; And by a friend of mine , bold faith , that burn 'd , I called him to a strict accompt . He said that , by the law , the challeng 'd might Take the advantage both of arms and fight .</p>
   <p>III . Two darts of equal length and points he sent , And nobly gave the choyce to me , Which I not weigh 'd , young and indifferent , Now full of nought but victorie . So we both met in one of 's mother 's groves , The time , at the first murm'ring of her doves .</p>
   <p>IV . I stript myself naked all o 're , as he : For so I was best arm 'd , when bare . His first pass did my liver rase : yet I Made home a falsify &lt; 74. 1 > too neer : For when my arm to its true distance came , I nothing touch 'd but a fantastick flame .</p>
   <p>V. This , this is love we daily quarrel so , An idle Don-Quichoterie : We whip our selves with our own twisted wo , And wound the ayre for a fly . The only way t ’ undo this enemy Is to laugh at the boy , and he will cry .</p>
   <p>&lt; 74. 1 > “ To falsify a thrust , ” says Phillips ( WORLD OF WORDS , ed . 1706 , art . FALSIFY ) , “ is to make a feigned pass . ” Lovelace here employs the word as a substantive rather awkwardly ; but the meaning is , no doubt , the same .</p>
   <p>CUPID FAR GONE .</p>
   <p>I . What , so beyond all madnesse is the elf , Now he hath got out of himself ! His fatal enemy the Bee , Nor his deceiv 'd artillerie , His shackles , nor the roses bough Ne'r half so netled him , as he is now .</p>
   <p>II .&lt; 75. 1 > See ! at 's own mother he is offering ; His finger now fits any ring ; Old Cybele he would enjoy , And now the girl , and now the boy . He proffers Jove a back caresse , And all his love in the antipodes .</p>
   <p>III . Jealous of his chast Psyche , raging he Quarrels with &lt; 75. 2 > student Mercurie , And with a proud submissive breath Offers to change his darts with Death . He strikes at the bright eye of day , And Juno tumbles in her milky way .</p>
   <p>IV . The dear sweet secrets of the gods he tells , And with loath 'd hate lov 'd heaven he swells ; Now , like a fury , he belies Myriads of pure virginities , And swears , with this false frenzy hurl 'd , There 's not a vertuous she in all the world .</p>
   <p>V. Olympus he renownces , then descends , And makes a friendship with the fiends ; Bids Charon be no more a slave , He Argos rigg 'd with stars shall have , And triple Cerberus from below Must leash 'd t ’ himself with him a hunting go .</p>

   <p>A MOCK SONG .</p>
   <p>I . Now Whitehall 's in the grave , And our head is our slave , The bright pearl in his close shell of oyster ; Now the miter is lost , The proud Praelates , too , crost , And all Rome 's confin 'd to a cloister . He , that Tarquin was styl 'd , Our white land 's exil 'd , Yea , undefil 'd ; Not a court ape 's left to confute us ; Then let your voyces rise high , As your colours did flye , And flour'shing cry : Long live the brave Oliver-Brutus .&lt; 76. 1 ></p>
   <p>II . Now the sun is unarm 'd , And the moon by us charm 'd , All the stars dissolv 'd to a jelly ; Now the thighs of the Crown And the arms are lopp 'd down , And the body is all but a belly . Let the Commons go on , The town is our own , We'l rule alone : For the Knights have yielded their spent-gorge ; And an order is tane With HONY SOIT profane , Shout forth amain : For our Dragon hath vanquish 'd the St. George .</p>

   <p>A FLY ABOUT A GLASSE OF BURNT CLARET .</p>
   <p>I. Forbear this liquid fire , Fly , It is more fatal then the dry , That singly , but embracing , wounds ; And this at once both burns and drowns .</p>
   <p>II . The salamander , that in heat And flames doth cool his monstrous sweat , Whose fan a glowing cake is said , Of this red furnace is afraid .</p>
   <p>III . Viewing the ruby-christal shine , Thou tak'st it for heaven-christalline ; Anon thou wilt be taught to groan : ‘ Tis an ascended Acheron .</p>
   <p>IV . A snow-ball heart in it let fall , And take it out a fire-ball ; Ali icy breast in it betray 'd Breaks a destructive wild granade .</p>
   <p>V. ‘ Tis this makes Venus altars shine , This kindles frosty Hymen 's pine ; When the boy grows old in his desires , This flambeau doth new light his fires .</p>
   <p>VI . Though the cold hermit over wail , Whose sighs do freeze , and tears drop hail , Once having pass 'd this , will ne'r Another flaming purging fear .</p>
   <p>VII . The vestal drinking this doth burn Now more than in her fun'ral urn ; Her fires , that with the sun kept race , Are now extinguish 'd by her face .</p>
   <p>VIII . The chymist , that himself doth still ,&lt; 78. 1 > Let him but tast this limbecks &lt; 78. 2 > bill , And prove this sublimated bowl , He 'll swear it will calcine a soul .</p>
   <p>IX . Noble , and brave ! now thou dost know The false prepared decks below , Dost thou the fatal liquor sup , One drop , alas ! thy barque blowes up .</p>
   <p>X . What airy country hast to save , Whose plagues thou'lt bury in thy grave ? For even now thou seem'st to us On this gulphs brink a Curtius .</p>
   <p>XI . And now th ’ art faln ( magnanimous Fly ) In , where thine Ocean doth fry , Like the Sun 's son , who blush 'd the flood To a complexion of blood .</p>
   <p>XII . Yet , see ! my glad auricular Redeems thee ( though dissolv 'd ) a star , Flaggy &lt; 78. 3 > thy wings , and scorch 'd thy thighs , Thou ly'st a double sacrifice .</p>
   <p>XIII . And now my warming , cooling breath Shall a new life afford in death ; See ! in the hospital of my hand Already cur 'd , thou fierce do'st stand .</p>
   <p>XIV . Burnt insect ! dost thou reaspire The moist-hot-glasse and liquid fire ? I see ‘ tis such a pleasing pain , Thou would'st be scorch 'd and drown 'd again .</p>

   <p>&lt; 86. 1 > One of the younger brothers of the poet . In the year of the Restoration he filled the office of Recorder of Canterbury , and in that capacity delivered the address of the city to Charles II . on his passage through the place . This speech was printed in 1660 , 4to , three leaves . The following extracts from the CALENDARS OF STATE PAPERS ( Domestic Series , 1660-1 , page 139 ) , throw a little additional light on the history of this person :—</p>

   <p>I . The day is curl 'd about agen To view the splendor she was in ; When first with hallow 'd hands The holy man knit the mysterious bands When you two your contracted souls did move Like cherubims above , And did make love , As your un-understanding issue now , In a glad sigh , a smile , a tear , a vow .</p>
   <p>II . Tell me , O self-reviving Sun , In thy perigrination Hast thou beheld a pair Twist their soft beams like these in their chast air ? As from bright numberlesse imbracing rayes Are sprung th ’ industrious dayes , So when they gaze , And change their fertile eyes with the new morn , A beauteous offspring is shot forth , not born .</p>
   <p>III . Be witness then , all-seeing Sun , Old spy , thou that thy race hast run In full five thousand rings ;&lt; 89. 3 > To thee were ever purer offerings Sent on the wings of Faith ? and thou , O Night ,&lt; 89. 4 > Curtain of their delight , By these made bright , Have you not mark 'd their coelestial play , And no more peek 'd the gayeties of day ?</p>
   <p>IV . Come then , pale virgins , roses strow , Mingled with Ios as you go . The snowy ox is kill 'd , The fane with pros'lyte lads and lasses fill 'd , You too may hope the same seraphic joy , Old time cannot destroy , Nor fulnesse cloy ; When , like these , you shall stamp by sympathies Thousands of new-born-loves with your chaste eyes .</p>
   <p>&lt; 89. 1 > Lovelace was connected with the Stanleys through the Auchers . The Kentish families , about this time , intermarried with each other to a very large extent , partly to indemnify themselves from the consequences of gravelkind tenure ( though many had procured parliamentary relief ) ; and the Lovelaces , the Stanleys , the Hammonds , the Sandyses , were all more or less bound together by the ties of kindred . See the tree prefixed by Sir Egerton Brydges to his edition of HAMMOND 'S POEMS , 1816 , and the Introduction to STANLEY 'S POEMS , 1814 . Sir William Lovelace , the poet 's grandfather , married Elizabeth , daughter of Edward Aucher , Esq ., of Bishopsbourne , near Canterbury , while Sir William Hammond , of St. Alban 's Court , married , as his second wife , Elizabeth , daughter of Anthony Aucher , Esq ., of Bishopsbourne , by whom he had , among other children , Mary , who became the wife of Sir Thomas Stanley , of Cumberlow , father of Thomas Stanley , the poet , historian , and translator of Bion , &amp; c .</p>
   <p>&lt; 89. 2 > See THE POEMS OF WILLIAM HAMMOND , 1655 , edited by Sir E. Brydges , 1816 , p. 54 , where there is a similar poem on Stanley and his bride from the pen of Hammond , who also claimed relationship with the then newly-married poet .

   <p>&lt; 90. 1 > Louis XI . of France was the prince here intended . See MERY TALES AND QUICKE ANSWERS , No . 23 ( ed . Hazlitt ) . I fear that if Lovelace had derived his knowledge of this incident &lt; f > rom the little work mentioned , he would have been still more sarcastic ; for Louis , in the TALES AND QUICKE ANSWERS , is made to give , not 500 crowns for a turnip , but 1000 crowns for a radish .</p>
   <p>&lt; 90. 2 > Perhaps Lovelace is rather too severe on Sannazaro . That writer is said to have occupied twenty years in the composition of his poem on the Birth of the Saviour , for which he probably did not receive a sixth part of the sum paid to him for his hexastic on Venice ; and so he deserved this little windfal , which came out of the pocket of a Government rich enough to pay it ten times over . See Corniano 's VITA DI JACOPO SANNAZARO , prefixed to the edition of his ARCADIA , published at Milan in 1806 . Amongst the translations printed at the end of LUCASTA , and which it seems very likely were among the earliest poetical essays of Lovelace , is this very epigram of Sannazaro . As in the case of THE ANT , I have little doubt that the satire was suggested by the translation .</p>

   <p>&lt; 90. 10 > A hard toasted crust .</p>
   <p>&lt; 90. 11 > A fee or gratuity given to a poet on a mournful occasion , and made more liberal by the circumstances of affliction in which the donors are placed .</p>
   <p>&lt; 90. 12 > Generally , a mere coxcomb or dandy ; but here the poet implies a man about town who is rich enough to indulge in fashionable luxuries .</p>
   <p>&lt; 90. 13 > The ribbon by which the star of an order of knighthood was attached to the breast of the fortunate recipient . It sometimes also stood for the armlet worn by gentlemen in our poet 's day , as a mark of some lady 's esteem . See Shirley 's POEMS ( Works , vi . 440 ) .</p>
   <p>&lt; 90. 14 > A crude anagram .</p>
   <p>&lt; 90. 15 > An imperfect acrostic . Few readers require to be told that anagrams and acrostics were formerly one of the most fashionable species of composition . Lovelace here pictures a poetaster “ stewing ” his brains with a poem of this description , which of course demanded a certain amount of tedious and minute attention to the arrangement of the name of the individual to whom the anagram or acrostic was to be addressed , and this was especially the case , where the writer contemplated a DOUBLE acrostic .</p>

   <p>II . Nor trus &lt; 93. 3 > thy golden feet and wings . It may &lt; 93. 4 > be thought false melody &lt; 93. 5 > T ’ ascend to heav'n by silver strings ; This is Urania 's heraldry . Thy royal poem now we may extol , As &lt; 93. 6 > truly Luna blazon 'd upon Sol .</p>
   <p>III . As when Amphion first did call Each listning stone from 's den ; And with his &lt; 93. 7 > lute did form the &lt; 93. 8 > wall , But with his words the men ; So in your twisted numbers now you thus Not only stocks perswade , but ravish us .</p>
   <p>IV . Thus do your ayrs eccho ore The notes and anthems of the sphaeres , And their whole consort back restore , As if earth too would blesse Heav'ns ears ; But yet the spoaks , by which they scal 'd so high , Gamble hath wisely laid of UT RE MI .</p>

( The copy among the King 's pamphlets in the British Museum appears to have been purchased on the 8th Sept . 1656 . ) The variations between the texts of 1656 and 1659 are chiefly literal , but a careful collation has enabled me to rectify one or two errors of the press in LUCASTA .</p>

     <l n="49">That is but left to a successive trust ;</l>
     <l n="50">The soul 's first buried in his bodies dust .</l>

     <l n="55">And he that weeps thy funerall , in one</l>

     <l n="57">And under what ( now ) covert must I sing ,</l>
     <l n="58">Secure as if beneath a cherub 's wing ;</l>
     <l n="59">When thou hast tane thy flight hence , and art nigh</l>
     <l n="60">In place to some related hierarchie ,</l>
     <l n="61">Where a bright wreath of glories doth but set</l>
     <l n="62">Upon thy head an equal coronet ;</l>
     <l n="63">And thou , above our humble converse gon ,</l>
     <l n="64">Canst but be reach 'd by contemplation .</l>
     <l n="65">Our lutes ( as thine was touch 'd ) were vocall by ,</l>
     <l n="66">And thence receiv 'd the soul by sympathy ,</l>
     <l n="67">That did above the threds inspiring creep ,</l>
     <l n="68">And with soft whispers broke the am'rous sleep ;</l>
     <l n="69">Which now no more ( mov 'd with the sweet surprise )</l>
     <l n="70">Awake into delicious rapsodies ;</l>
     <l n="71">But with their silent mistress do comply ,</l>
     <l n="72">And fast in undisturbed slumbers lye .</l>
     <l n="73">How from thy first ascent thou didst disperse</l>
     <l n="74">A blushing warmth throughout the universe ,</l>
     <l n="75">While near the morns Lucasta 's fires did glow ,</l>
     <l n="76">And to the earth a purer dawn did throw .</l>
     <l n="77">We ever saw thee in the roll of fame</l>
     <l n="78">Advancing thy already deathless name ;</l>
     <l n="79">And though it could but be above its fate ,</l>
     <l n="80">Thou would'st , however , super-errogate .</l>
     <l n="81">Now as in Venice , when the wanton State</l>
     <l n="82">Before a Spaniard spread their crowded plate ,</l>
     <l n="83">He made it the sage business of his eye</l>
     <l n="84">To find the root of the wild treasury ;</l>
     <l n="85">So lear n't from that exchequer but the more</l>
     <l n="86">To rate his masters vegetable ore .</l>
     <l n="87">Thus when the Greek and Latin muse we read ,</l>
     <l n="88">As but the &lt; 110. 1 > cold inscriptions of the dead ,</l>
     <l n="89">We to advantage then admired thee ,</l>
     <l n="90">Who did'st live on still with thy poesie ;</l>
     <l n="91">And in our proud enjoyments never knew</l>
     <l n="92">The end of the unruly wealth that grew .</l>
     <l n="93">But now we have the last dear ingots gain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="94">And the free vein ( however rich ) is drein 'd ;</l>
     <l n="95">Though what thou hast bequeathed us , no space</l>
     <l n="96">Of this worlds span of time shall ere embrace .</l>
     <l n="97">But as who sometimes knew not to conclude</l>
     <l n="98">Upon the waters strange vicissitude ,</l>
     <l n="99">Did to the ocean himself commit ,</l>
     <l n="100">That it might comprehend what could not it ,</l>
     <l n="101">So we in our endeavours must out-done</l>
     <l n="102">Be swallowed up within thy Helicon .</l>
     <l n="103">Thou , who &lt; 110. 2 > art layd up in thy precious cave ,</l>
     <l n="104">And from the hollow spaces of thy grave ,</l>
     <l n="105">We still may mourn in tune , but must alone</l>
     <l n="106">Hereafter hope to quaver out a grone ;</l>
     <l n="107">No more the chirping sonnets with shrill notes</l>
     <l n="108">Must henceforth volley from our treble throtes ;</l>
     <l n="109">But each sad accent must be humour 'd well</l>
     <l n="110">To the deep solemn organ of thy cell .</l>
     <l n="111">Why should some rude hand carve thy sacred stone ,</l>
     <l n="112">And there incise a cheap inscription ?</l>
