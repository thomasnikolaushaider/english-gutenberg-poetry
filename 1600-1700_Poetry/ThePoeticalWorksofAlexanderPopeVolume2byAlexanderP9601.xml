    <docTitle><titlePart>POETICAL WORKS OF ALEXANDER POPE . With Memoir , Critical Dissertation , and Explanatory Notes , BY THE REV . GEORGE GILFILLAN . VOL . II . M. DCCC. LVI . THE GENIUS AND POETRY OF POPE .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>Few poets during their lifetime have been at once so much admired and so much abused as Pope . Some writers , destined to oblivion in after-ages , have been loaded with laurels in their own time ; while others , on whom Fame was one day to “ wait like a menial , ” have gone to the grave neglected , if not decried and depreciated . But it was the fate of Pope to combine in his single experience the extremes of detraction and flattery — to have the sunshine of applause and the hail-storm of calumny mingled on his living head ; while over his dead body , as over the body of Patroclus , there has raged a critical controversy , involving not merely his character as a man , but his claims as a poet . For this , unquestionably , there are some subordinate reasons . Pope 's religious creed , his political connexions , his easy circumstances , his popularity with the upper classes , as well as his testy temper and malicious disposition , all tended to rouse against him , while he lived , a personal as well as public hostility , altogether irrespective of the mere merit or demerit of his poetry . “ We cannot bear a Papist to be our principal bard , ” said one class . “ No Tory for our translator of Homer , ” cried the zealous Whigs , “ Poets should be poor , and Pope is independent , ” growled Grub Street . The ancients could not endure that a “ poet should build an house , but this varlet has dug a grotto , and established a clandestine connexion between Parnassus and the Temple of Plutus . ” “ Pope , ” said others , “ is hand-in-glove with Lords<settlement>Oxford</settlement>and Bolingbroke , and it was never so seen before in any genuine child of genius . ” “ He is a little ugly insect , ” cried another class ; “ can such a misbegotten brat be a favourite with the beautiful Apollo ? ” “ He is as venomous and spiteful as he is small ; never was so much of the ‘ essence of devil ’ packed into such a tiny compass , ” said another set ; “ and this , to be sure , is<country>England</country>'s great poet ! ” Besides these personal objections , there were others of a more solid character . While all admitted the exquisite polish and terse language of Pope 's compositions , many felt that they were too artificial — that they were often imitative — that they seldom displayed those qualities of original thought and sublime enthusiasm which had formed the chief characteristics of<country>England</country>'s best bards , and were slow to rank the author of “ Eloisa and Abelard , ” with the creator of “ Hamlet , ” “ Othello , ” and “ Lear ; ” the author of the “ Rape of the Lock ” with the author of “ Paradise Lost ; ” the author of the “ Pastorals , ” with the author of the “ Faery Queen ; ” and the author of the “ Imitations of Horace , ” with the author of the “ Canterbury Tales . ” On the one hand , Pope 's ardent friends erred in classing him with or above these great old writers ; and on the other , his enemies were thus provoked to thrust him too far down in the scale , and to deny him genius altogether . Since his death , his fame has continued to vibrate between extremes . Lord Byron and Lord Carlisle ( the latter , in a lecture delivered in Leeds in December<date>1850</date>, and published afterwards ) have placed him ridiculously high ; while Wordsworth , Coleridge , and Bowles , have underrated him . It shall be our endeavour , in our succeeding remarks , to steer a middle course between the parties . Lord Carlisle commenced his able and eloquent prelection by deploring the fact , that Pope had sunk in estimation . And yet , a few sentences after , he told us that the “ Commissioners of the Fine Arts ” selected Pope , along with Chaucer , Shakspeare , Spenser , Milton , and Dryden , to fill the six vacant places in the New Palace of Westminster . This does not substantiate the assertion , that Pope has sunk in estimation . Had he sunk to any great extent , the Commissioners would not have dared to put his name and statue beside those of the acknowledged masters of English poetry . But apart from this , we do think that Lord Carlisle has exaggerated the “ Decline and Fall ” of the empire of Pope . He is still , with the exception , perhaps , of Cowper , the most popular poet of the eighteenth century . His “ Essay on Man , ” and his “ Eloisa and Abelard , ” are probably in every good library , public and private , in Great Britain . Can we say as much of Chaucer and Spenser ? Passages and lines of his poetry are stamped on the memory of all well-educated men . More pointed sayings of Pope are afloat than of any English poet , except Shakspeare and Young . Indeed , if frequency of quotation be the principal proof of popularity , Pope , with Shakspeare , Young , and Spenser , is one of the four most popular of English poets . In<country>America</country>, too , Lord Carlisle found , he tells us , the most cultivated and literary portion of that great community warmly imbued with an admiration of Pope . What more would , or at least should , his lordship desire ? Pope is , by his own showing , a great favourite with many wherever the English language is spoken , and that , too , a century after his death . And there are few critics who would refuse to subscribe , on the whole , Lord Carlisle 's enumeration of the Poet 's qualities ; his terse and motto-like lines — the elaborate gloss of his mock-heroic vein — the tenderness of his pathos — the point and polished strength of his satire — the force and vraisemblance of his descriptions of character — the delicacy and refinement of his compliments , “ each of which , ” says Hazlitt , “ is as good as an house or estate ” — and the heights of moral grandeur into which he can at times soar , whenever he has manly indignation , or warm-hearted patriotism , or high-minded scorn to express . If Lord Carlisle 's object , then , was to elevate Pope to the rank of a classic , it was a superfluous task ; if it was to justify the Commissioners in placing him on a level with Chaucer , Shakspeare , Spenser , and Milton , our remarks will show that we think it as vain as superfluous . In endeavouring to fix the rank of a poet , there are , we think , the following elements to be analysed :— His original genius — his kind and degree of culture — his purpose — his special faculties — the works he has written — and the amount of impression he has made on , and impulse he has given to , his own age and the world . In other words , what were his native powers , and what has he done , for , by , and with them ? Now , that Pope possessed genius , and genius of a high order , we strenuously maintain . But whether this amounted to creative power , the highest quality of the poet , is a very different question . In native imagination , that eyesight of the soul , which sees in the rose a richer red , in the sky a deeper azure , in the sea a more dazzling foam , in the stars a softer and more spiritual gold , and in the sky a more dread magnificence than nature ever gave them , that beholds the Ideal always shining through and above the Real , and that lights the poet on to form within a new and more gorgeous nature , the fresh creation of his own inspired mind , Pope was not only inferior to Chaucer , Shakspeare , Spenser , and Milton , but to Young , Thomson , Collins , Burns , Wordsworth , Keats , Shelley , Byron , Coleridge , and many other poets . His native faculty , indeed , seems rather fine than powerful — rather timid than daring , and resembles rather the petal of a rose peeping out into the summer air , which seems scarce warm enough for its shrinking loveliness , than the feather of the wing of a great eagle , dipping into the night tempest , which raves around the inaccessible rock of his birthplace . He was not eminently original in his thinking . In proof of this , many of those fine sentiments which Pope has thrown into such perfect shape , and to which he has given such dazzling burnish , are found by Watson ( see the “ Adventurer ” ) in Pascal and others . Shakspeare 's wisdom , on the other hand , can be traced to Shakspeare 's brain , and no further , although he has borrowed the plots of his plays . Who lent Chaucer his pictures , fresh as dewdrops from the womb of the morning ? Spenser 's Allegories are as native to him as his dreams ; and if Milton has now and then carried off a load which belonged to another , it was a load which only a giant 's arm could lift , and which he added to a caravan of priceless wealth , the native inheritance of his own genius . The highest rank of poets descend on their sublime subjects , like Uriel , descending alongst his sunbeam on the mountain tops ; another order , with care , and effort , and circumspection , often with ‘ Labour dire and weary woe , ’ reach noble heights , and there wave their hats , and dance in astonishment at their own perseverance and success . So it is with Pope in his peroration to the Dunciad , and in many other of the serious and really eloquent passages of his works . They ARE eloquent , brilliant , in composition faultless ; but the intense self-consciousness of their author , and their visible elaboration , prevent them from seeming or being great . Of Pope , you say , “ He smells of the midnight lamp ; ” of Dante , boys cried out on the street , “ Lo ! the man that was in hell . ” With the very first class of poets , artificial objects become natural , the “ rod ” becomes a “ serpent ; ” with Pope , natural objects become artificial , the “ serpent ” becomes a “ rod . ” Wordsworth makes a spade poetical ; Pope would have made Skiddaw little better than a mass of prose . Let us hear Hazlitt : “ Pope saw nature only dressed by art ; he judged of beauty by fashion ; he sought for truth in the opinions of the world ; he judged the feelings of others by his own . The capacious soul of Shakspeare had an intuitive and mighty sympathy with whatever could enter into the heart of man in all possible circumstances ; Pope had an exact knowledge of all that he himself loved or hated , wished or wanted . Milton has winged his daring flight from heaven to earth , through Chaos and old Night ; Pope 's Muse never wandered in safety , but from his library to his grotto , or from his grotto into his library , back again . His mind dwelt with greater pleasure on his own garden than on the garden of Eden ; he could describe the faultless whole-length mirror that reflected his own person , better than the smooth surface of the lake that reflects the face of heaven ; a piece of cut glass or pair of paste-buckles with more brilliancy and effect than a thousand dewdrops glittering in the sun . He would be more delighted with a patent lamp than with the ‘ pale reflex of Cynthia 's brow , ’ that fills the sky with the soft silent lustre that trembles through the cottage window , and cheers the mariner on the lonely wave . He was the poet of personality and polished life . That which was nearest to him was the greatest . His mind was the antithesis of strength and grandeur ; its power was the power of indifference . He had none of the enthusiasm of poetry ; he was in poetry what the sceptic is in religion . In his smooth and polished verse we meet with no prodigies of nature , but with miracles of wit ; the thunders of his pen are whispered flatteries ; its forked lightnings , pointed sarcasms ; for the ‘ gnarled oak , ’ he gives us the ‘ soft myrtle ; ’ for rocks , and seas , and mountains , artificial grass-plots , gravel-walks , and tinkling rills ; for earthquakes and tempests , the breaking of a flower-pot or the fall of a China jar ; for the tug and war of the elements , or the deadly strife of the passions , “ ‘ Calm contemplation and poetic ease . ’ “ Yet within this retired and narrow circle , how much , and that how exquisite , was contained ! What discrimination , what wit , what delicacy , what fancy , what lurking spleen , what elegance of thought , what pampered refinement of sentiment ! ” A great deal of discussion took place , during the famous controversy about Pope between Bowles and Byron , on the questions — what objects are and are not fitted for poetic purposes , and whether natural or artificial objects be better suited for the treatment of the poet . In our life of Bowles we promised , and shall now proceed to attempt , a short review of the question then at issue , and which on both sides was pled with such ingenuity , ardour , and eloquence . The question , professedly that of the province , slides away into what is the nature of poetry . The object of poetry is , we think , to show the infinite through the finite — to reveal the ideal in the real — it seeks , by clustering analogies and associations around objects , to give them a beautiful , or sublime , or interesting , or terrible aspect which is not entirely their own . Now , as all objects in comparison with the infinite are finite , and all realities in comparison with the ideal are little , it follows that between artificial and natural objects , as fitted for poetic purposes , there is no immense disparity , and that both are capable of poetic treatment . Both , accordingly , have become subservient to high poetic effect ; and even the preponderance , whatever it be on the part of natural objects , has sometimes been equalised by the power of genius , and artificial things have often been made to wring the heart or awaken the fancy , as much or more than the other class . Think , for instance , of the words in Lear ,</docImprint>
    <epigraph>
     <p>“ Prithee , undo this button . Thank you , sir . ” What more contemptibly artificial than a button ? And yet , beating in the wind of the hysterical passion which is tearing the heart of the poor dying king , what a powerful index of misery it becomes , and its “ undoing , ” as the sign of the end of the tragedy , and the letting forth of the great injured soul , has melted many to tears ! When Lady Macbeth exclaims , in that terrible crisis , “ Give me the daggers ! " ’</p>
    </epigraph>
    <docImprint>who feels not , that , although a dagger be only an artificial thing , no natural or supernatural thing , not the flaming sword of the Cherubim itself , could seem , in the circumstances , more fearfully sublime . What action more artificial than dancing , and yet how grand it seems , in Ford 's heroine , who continues to dance on till the ball is finished , while the news of “ death , and death , and death ” of friend , brother , husband , are successively recounted to her — and then herself expires ! There seems no comparison between a diamond and a star , and yet a Shakspeare or a Schiller could so describe the trembling of a diamond on the brow say of Belshazzar when the apparition of the writing on the wall disturbed his impious feast , that it would seem more ideal and more magnificent than a star “ trembling on the hand of God ” when newly created , or trembling on the verge of everlasting darkness , when its hour had come . A slipper seems a very commonplace object ; but how interesting the veritable slipper of Empedocles , who flung himself into Etna , whose slipper was disgorged by the volcano , and as a link , connecting the seen with the unseen , the grassy earth with the burning entrails of the eternal furnace , became intensely imaginative ! A feather in a cap ( even though it were an eagle 's ) seems , from its position , an object sufficiently artificial ; but how affecting the black plume of Ravenswood floating on the waves which had engulphed the proud head that once bore it , and which old Caleb took up , dried , and placed in his bosom ! Nor are we sure that there are any objects so small or vulgar but what genius could extract poetry from them . In Pope 's hands , indeed , the “ clouded cane ” and the “ amber snuff-box ” of Sir Plume assume no ideal aspect ; but in Shakspeare 's it might have been different ; and the highest order of genius , like true catholicity of faith , counts “ nothing common or unclean . ” What poetry Burns has gathered up even in “ Poosie Nancy 's , ” which had been lying unsuspected at the feet of beggars , prostitutes , and pickpockets ! What powerful imagination there is in Crabbe 's descriptions of poorhouses , prisons , and asylums ; and in Wordsworth 's “ Old Cumberland Beggar , ” who , although he lived and died in the “ eye of nature , ” was clothed in rags , and had the vulgar , mendicant meal-bag slung over his shoulders ! What pathos Scott extracts from that “ black bitch of a boat , ” which Mucklebackit , in the frenzy of his grief , accuses for the loss of his son ! Which of the lower animals less poetical or coarser than a swine ? and yet Shakspeare introduces such a creature with great effect in “ Macbeth , ” in that weird dialogue of the witches —</docImprint>
    <epigraph>
     <p>“ Where hast thou been , sister ? ” “ Killing swine . ” And Goethe makes it ideal by mingling it with the mad revelry of the “ Walpurgis Night ” — “ An able sow , with old Baubo upon her . Is worthy of glory and worthy of honour . ” The whole truth on this vexed question may perhaps be summed up in the following propositions :— 1st , No object , natural or artificial , is per se out of the province of imagination ; 2d , There is no infinite gulf between natural and artificial objects , or between the higher and lower degrees of either , as subjects for the idealising power of poetry ; 3d , Ere any object natural or artificial , become poetical , it must be subjected more or less to the transfiguring power of imagination ; and , 4th , Some objects in nature , and some in art , need less of this transforming magic than others , and are thus intrinsically , although not immeasurably , superior in adaptation to the purposes of poetry . The great point , after all , is , What eye beholds objects , whether natural or artificial ? Is it a poetical eye or not ? For given a poet 's eye , then it matters little on what object that eye be fixed , it becomes poetical ; where there is intrinsic poetry — as in mountains , the sea , the sky , the stars — it comes rushing out to the silent spell of genius ; where there is less — as in artificial objects , or the poorer productions of nature — the mind of the poet must exert itself tenfold , and shed on it its own wealth and glory . Now , Pope , we fear , wanted almost entirely this true second sight . Take , for instance , the “ lock ” in the famous “ Rape ! ” What fancy , humour , wit , eloquence , he brings to play around it ! But he never touches it , even en passant , with a ray of poetry . You never could dream of intertwining it with “ The tangles of Neaera 's hair , ” far less with the “ golden tresses ” and “ wanton ringlets ” of our primeval parent in the garden of Eden . Shakspeare , on the other hand , would have made it a dropping from the shorn sun , or a mad moonbeam gone astray , or a tress fallen from the hair of the star Venus , as she gazed too intently at her own image in the calm evening sea . Nor will Pope leave the “ lock ” entire in its beautiful smallness . He must apply a microscope to it , and stake his fame on idealising its subdivided , single hairs . The sylphs are created by combining the agility of Ariel with the lively impertinence of the inhabitants of Lilliput . Yet with what ease , elegance , and lingering love does he draw his petty Pucks , till , though too tiny for touch , they become palpable to vision ! On the whole , had not the “ Tempest ” and the “ Midsummer Night 's Dream ” existed before the “ Rape of the Lock , ” the machinery in it would have proclaimed Pope a man of creative imagination . As it is , it proves wonderful activity of fancy . Shakspeare 's delicate creations are touched again without crumbling at the touch , clad in new down , fed on a fresh supply of “ honey-dew , ” and sent out on minor but aerial errands — although , after all , we prefer Puck and Ariel — not to speak of those delectable personages , Cobweb , Peaseblossom , and Mustardseed . Ariel 's “ oak , ” in our poet 's hands , becomes a “ vial ” — “ knotty entrails ” are exchanged for a “ bodkin 's eye ” — the fine dew of the “ still vexed Bermoothes ” is degraded into an “ essence ; ” pomatum takes the place of poetry ; the enchanted lock , of an enchanted isle ; and the transformation of original imagination into ingenious fancy is completed before your eyes . Let the admirers of Pope , like the worshippers of Cæsar of old , “ beg a hair of him for memory ; ” for certainly he is more at home among hairs and curls than in any field where he has chosen to exercise his powers . About Pope originally there was a small , trivial , and stinted something which did not promise even the greatness he actually attained . We do not allude merely to his small stature , remembering that the nine-pin Napoleon overthrew half the thrones in Europe . But he possessed sana mens in sano copore , an erect figure , and was “ every inch a man , ” although his inches were few ; while in Pope , both bodily and mentally , there lay a crooked , waspish , and petty nature . His form too faithfully reflected his character . He was never , from the beginning to the close of his life , a great , broad , genial being . There was an unhealthy taint which partly enfeebled and partly corrupted him . His self-will , his ambition , his Pariah position , as belonging to the Roman Catholic faith , the feebleness of his constitution , the uncertainty of his real creed , and one or two other circumstances we do not choose to name , combined to create a life-long ulcer in his heart and temper , against which the vigour of his mind , the enthusiasm of his literary tastes , and the warmth of his heart , struggled with much difficulty . He had not , in short , the basis of a truly great poet , either in imagination or in nature . Nor , with all his incredible industry , tact , and talent , did he ever rise into the “ seventh heaven of invention . ” A splendid sylph let us call him — a “ giant angel ” he was not . His culture , like his genius , was rather elegant than profound . He lived in an age when a knowledge of the classics , with a tincture of the metaphysics of the schools , was thought a good average stock of learning , although it was the age , too , of such mighty scholars as Bentley , Clarke , and Warlburton . Pope seems to have glanced over a great variety of subjects with a rapid rechercé eye , not examined any one with a quiet , deep , longing , lingering , exhaustive look . He was no literary Behemoth , “ trusting that he could draw up Jordan into his mouth . ” He became thus neither an ill-informed writer , like Goldsmith , whose ingenuity must make up for his ignorance , nor one of those doctorum vatum , those learned poets , such as Dante , Milton , and Coleridge , whose works alone , according at least to Buchanan , are to obtain the rare and regal palm of immortality — “ Sola doctorum monumenta vatum Nesciunt fati imperium severi : Sola contemnunt Phlegethonta , et Orci Jura superbi . ” That his philosophy was empirical , is proved by his “ Essay on Man , ” which , notwithstanding all its brilliant rhetoric , is the shallow version of a shallow system of naturalism . And one may accommodate to him the well-known saying of Lyndhurst about Lord Brougham , “ who would have made a capital Chancellor if he had had only a little law ; ” so Pope was very well qualified to have translated Homer , barring his ignorance of Greek . But every page of his writings proves a wide and diversified knowledge — a knowledge , too , which he has perfectly under control — which he can make to go a great way — and by which , with admirable skill , he can subserve alike his moral and literary purpose . But the question now arises — What was his purpose ? Was it worthy of his powers ? Was it high , holy , and faithfully pursued ? No poet , we venture to say , can be great without a great purpose . “ Purpose is the edge and point of character ; it is the stamp and superscription of genius ; it is the direction on the letter of talent . Character without it is blunt and torpid ; talent without it is a letter which , undirected , goes nowhere ; genius without it is bullion , sluggish , splendid , and uncirculating . ” Now , Pope 's purpose seems , on the whole , dim and uncertain . He is indifferent to destruction , and careless about conserving . He is neither an infidel nor a Christian ; no Whig , but no very ardent Tory either . He seems to wish to support morality , but his support is stumbling and precarious ; although , on the other hand , notwithstanding his frequent coarseness of language and looseness of allusion , he exhibits no desire to overturn or undermine it . His bursts of moral feeling are very beautiful ( such as that containing the noble lines — “ Vice is undone if she forgets her earth , And stoops from angels to the dregs of birth . But ‘ tis the fall degrades her to a whore : Let greatness own her and she 's mean no more . Her birth , her beauty , crowds and courts confess , Chaste matrons praise her , and grave bishops bless . In golden chains the willing world she draws , And hers the gospel is , and hers the laws ; Mounts the tribunal , lifts her scarlet head , And sees pale Virtue carted in her stead . ” ) But they are brief , seem the result of momentary moods rather than the spray of a strong , steady current ; and he soon turns from them to the expression of his petty chagrins and personal animosities . In satire , he has not the indomitable pace and deep-mouthed bellow of a Juvenal , pursuing his object like a bloodhound : he resembles more a half-angry , half-playful terrier . To obtain a terse and musical expression for his thought is his artistic purpose , but that of his mind and moral nature is not so apparent in his poetry . Indeed , we are tempted at times to class him with his own sylphs in this respect , as well as in the elegance and swiftness of his genius . They neither belonged to heaven nor hell , but vibrated between in graceful gyrations . They laughed at , and toyed with , all things — never rising to dangerous heights , never sinking into profound abysses — fancying a lock a universe , and a universe only a larger lock — dancing like evening ephemeræ in the sunbeam , which was to be their sepulchre , and shutting their tiny eyes to all the solemn responsibilities , grave uncertainties , and mysterious destinies of human nature . And so , too often , did their poet . Pope 's special faculties are easily seen , and may be briefly enumerated . Destitute of the highest imagination , and perhaps of constructive power — ( he has produced many brilliant parts , and many little , but no large wholes ) — he is otherwise prodigally endowed . He has a keen , strong , clear intellect , which , if it seldom reaches sublimity , never fails to eliminate sense . He has wit of a polished and vigorous kind — less easy , indeed , than Addison 's , the very curl of whose lip was crucifixion to his foe . This wit , when exasperated into satire , is very formidable , for , like Addison 's , it does its work with little noise . Pope whispers poetic perdition — he deals in drops of concentrated bitterness — he stabs with a poisoned bodkin — he touches his enemies into stone with the light and playful finger of a fairy — and his more elaborate invectives glitter all over with the polish of profound malignity . His knowledge of human nature , particularly of woman 's heart , is great , but seems more the result of impish eavesdropping than of that thorough and genial insight which sympathy produces . He has listened at the keyhole , not by any “ Open Sesame ” entered the chamber . He has rather painted manners than men . His power of simulating passion is great ; but the passion must , in general , be mingled with unnatural elements ere he can realise it — the game must be putrid ere he can enjoy its flavour . He has no humour , at least in his poetry . It is too much of an unconscious outflow , and partakes too much of the genial and the human nature for him . His fancy is lively and copious , but its poetical products often resemble the forced fruits of a hothouse rather than those of a natural soil and climate . His description of Sporus , lauded by Byron as a piece of imagination , is exceedingly artificial and far-fetched in its figures — a mere mass of smoked gumflowers . Compare for fancy the speeches of Mercutio , in “ Romeo and Juliet , ” the “ Rape of the Lock , ” if we would see the difference between a spontaneous and artificial outpouring of images , between a fancy as free as fervid , and one lashing itself into productiveness . His power of describing natural objects is far from first-rate ; he enumerates instead of describing ; he omits nothing in the scene except the one thing needful — the bright poetical gleam or haze which ought to have been there . There is the “ grass ” but not the “ splendour ” — the “ flower ” but not the “ glory . ” In depicting character , it is very different . His likenesses of men and women , so far as manners , external features , and the contrasts produced by the accidents of circumstances and the mutation of affairs , are inimitable . His power of complimenting is superior even to that of Louis XIV . He picks out the one best quality in a man , sets it in gold , and presents it as if he were conferring instead of describing a noble gift . “ Would you be blest , despise low joys , low gains , Disdain whatever Cornbury disdains ; Be virtuous , and be happy for your pains . ”</p>

    <docImprint>Pope 's language seems as if it were laboriously formed by himself for his peculiar shape of mind , habits of thought , and style of poetry . Compared to all English before him , Pope 's English is a new although a lesser language . He has so cut down , shorn , and trimmed the broad old oak of Shakspeare 's speech , that it seems another tree altogether . Everything is so terse , so clear , so pointed , so elaborately easy , so monotonously brilliant , that you must pause to remember . “ These are the very copulatives , diphthongs , and adjectives of Hooker , Milton , and Jeremy Taylor . ” The change at first is pleasant , and has been generally popular ; but those who know and love our early authors , soon miss their deep organ-tones , their gnarled strength , their intricate but intense sweetness , their varied and voluminous music , their linked chains of lightning , and feel the difference between the fabricator of clever lines and sparkling sentences , and the former of great passages and works . In keeping with his style is his versification , the incessant tinkling of a sheep-bell — sweet , small , monotonous — producing perfectly-melodious single lines , but no grand interwoven swells and well-proportioned masses of harmony . “ Pope , ” says Hazlitt , “ has turned Pegasus into a rocking-horse . ” The noble gallop of Dryden 's verse is exchanged for a quick trot . And there is not even a point of comparison between his sweet sing-song , and the wavy , snow-like , spirit-like motion of Milton 's loftier passages ; or the gliding , pausing , fitful , river-like progress of Shakspeare 's verse ; or the fretted fury , and “ torrent-rapture ” of brave old Chapman in his translation of Homer ; or the rich , long-drawn-out , slow-swimming , now soft-languishing , and now full-gushing melody of Spenser 's “ Faery Queen . ” — Yet , within his own sphere , Pope was , as Scott calls him , a “ Deacon of his craft ; ” he aimed at , and secured , correctness and elegance ; his part is not the highest , but in it he approaches absolute perfection ; and with all his monotony of manner and versification , he is one of the most interesting of writers , and many find a greater luxury in reading his pages than those of any other poet . He is the facile princeps of those poetical writers who have written for , and are so singularly appreciated by , the fastidious — that class who are more staggered by faults than delighted with beauties . Our glance at his individual works must be brief and cursory . His “ Ode to Solitude ” is the most simple and natural thing he ever wrote , and in it he seems to say to nature , “ Vale , longum vale . ” His “ Pastorals ” have an unnatural and luscious sweetness . He has sugared his milk ; it is not , as it ought to be , warm from the cow , and fresh as the clover . How different his “ Rural Life ” from the rude , rough pictures of Theocritus , and the delightfully true and genial pages of the “ Gentle Shepherd ! ” His “ Windsor Forest ” is an elegant accumulation of sweet sonnets and pleasant images , but the freshness of the dew is not resting on every bud and blade . No shadowy forms are seen retiring amidst the glades of the forest ; no Uriels seem descending on the sudden slips of afternoon sunshine which pierce athwart the green or brown masses of foliage ; and you cannot say of his descriptions that</docImprint>

     <p>“ Visions , as poetic eyes avow , Hang on each leaf and cling to every bough . ” Shelley studied the scenery of his fine poem , “ Alastor , ” in the same shades with Pope ; but he had , like Jonathan of old , touched his lips with a rod dipped in poetic honey , and his “ eyes were enlightened ” to see sights of beauty and mystery which to the other are denied . Keats could have comprised all the poetry of “ Windsor Forest ” into one sonnet or line ; indeed , has he not done so , where , describing his soul following the note of the nightingale into the far depths of the woods , where she is pouring out her heart in song , he says — “ And with thee fade away into the forest dim ? ” The “ Essay on Criticism ” is rather a wonderful , intellectual , and artistic feat , than a true poem . It is astonishing as the work of a boy of nineteen , and contains a unique collection of clever and sparkling sentences , displaying the highest powers of acuteness and assimilation , if not much profound and original insight or genius . This poem suggests the wish that more of our critics would write in verse . The music might lessen the malice , and set off the commonplace to advantage , so that if there were no “ reason , ” there might be at least “ rhyme . ” His “ Lines to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady ” are too elaborate and artificial for the theme . It is a tale of intrigue , murder , and suicide , set to a musical snuff-box ! His “ Rape of the Lock ” we have already characterised . It is an “ Iliad in a nutshell , ” an Epic of Lilliput , where all the proportions are accurately observed , and where the finishing is so exact and admirable , that you fancy the author to have had microscopic eyes . It contains certainly the most elegant and brilliant badinage , the most graceful raillery , the most finished nonsense , and one of the most exquisitely-managed machineries in the language . His “ Eloisa and Abelard , ” a poem beautiful and almost unequalled in execution , is ill chosen in subject . He compels you indeed to weep , but you blame and trample on your tears after they are shed . Pope in this poem , as Shelley in the “ Cenci , ” has tried to extract beauty from moral deformity , and to glorify putrefaction . But who can long love to gaze at worms , however well painted , or will be disposed to pardon the monstrous choice of a dead or demon bride for the splendour of her wedding-garment ? The passion of the Eloisa and that of the Cenci were both indeed facts ; but many facts should be veiled statues in the Temple of Truth . To do , however , both Pope and Shelley justice , they touch their painful and shocking themes with extreme delicacy . “ Dryden , ” well remarks Campbell , “ would have given but a coarse draught of Eloisa 's passion . ” Pope 's Epistles , Satires , Imitations , &amp; c ., contain much of the most spirited sense and elegant sarcasm in literature . The portraits of “ Villars ” and “ Atticus ” will occur to every reader as masterpieces in power , although we deem the latter grossly unjust to a good and great man . His Homer is rather an adaptation than a translation — far less a “ transfusion ” of the Grecian bard . Pope does not , indeed , clothe the old blind rhapsodist with a bag-wig and sword ; but he does all short of this to make him a fine modern gentleman . Scott , we think , could have best rendered Homer in his ballad-rhyme . Chapman is Chapman , but he is not Homer . Pope is Pope , and Hobbes is Hobbes , and Sotheby is Sotheby , and Cowper is Cowper , each doing his best to render Homer , but none of them is the grand old Greek , whose lines are all simple and plain as brands , but like brands pointed on their edges with fire .</p>

    <docImprint>The “ Essay on Man ” ought to have been called an “ Epigram on Man , ” or , better still , should have been propounded as a riddle , to which the word “ Man ” was to supply the solution . But an antithesis , epigram , or riddle on man of<date>1300</date>lines , is rather long . It seems so especially as there is no real or new light cast in it on man 's nature or destiny . ( We refer our readers to the notes of Dr Croly 's edition for a running commentary of confutation to the “ Essay on Man ” distinguished by solid and unanswerable acuteness of argument . ) But such an eloquent and ingenious puzzle as it is ! It might have issued from the work-basket of Titania herself . It is another evidence of Pope 's greatness in trifles . How he would have shone in fabricating the staves of the ark , or the fringes of the tabernacle ! The “ Dunciad ” is in many respects the ablest , the most elaborate , and the most characteristic of Pope 's poems . In embalming insignificance and impaling folly he seems to have found , at last , his most congenial work . With what apparently sovereign contempt , masterly ease , artistic calm , and judicial gravity , does he set about it ! And once his museum of dunces is completed , with what dignity — the little tyrant that he was !— does he march through it , and with what complacency does he point to his slain and dried Dunces , and say , “ Behold the work of my hands ! ” It never seems to have occurred to him that his poem was destined to be an everlasting memorial , not only of his enemies , but of the annoyance he had met from them — at once of his strength in crushing , and his weakness in feeling , their attacks , and in showing their mummies for money . That Pope deserves , on the whole , the name of “ poet , ” we are willing , as aforesaid , to concede . But he was the most artificial of true poets . He had in him a real though limited vein , but did not trust sufficiently to it , and at once weakened and strengthened it by his peculiar kind of cultivation . He weakened it as a faculty , but strengthened it as an art ; he lessened its inward force , but increased the elegance and facility of its outward expression . What he might have attained , had he left his study and trim gardens , and visited the Alps , Snowdon , or the Grampians — had he studied Boileau less , and Dante , Milton , or the Bible more — we cannot tell ; but he certainly , in this case , would have left works greater , if not more graceful , behind him ; and if he had pleased his own taste and that of his age less , he might have more effectually touched the chord of the heart of all future time by his poetry . As it is , his works resemble rather the<settlement>London</settlement>Colosseum than Westminster Abbey . They are exquisite imitations of nature ; but we never can apply to them the words of the poet — “ O'er<country>England</country>'s abbeys bends the sky , As on its friends , with kindred eye ; For Nature gladly gave them place , Adopted them into her race , And granted them an equal date With Andes and with Ararat . ” Read , and admired , Pope must always be — if not for his poetry and passion , yet for his elegance , wit , satiric force , fidelity as a painter of artificial life , and the clear , pellucid English . But his deficiency in the creative faculty ( a deficiency very marked in two of his most lauded poems we have not specified , his “ Messiah ” and “ Temple of Fame , ” both eloquent imitations ) , his lack of profound thought , the general poverty of his natural pictures ( there are some fine ones in “ Eloisa and Abelard ” ) , the coarse and bitter element often intermingled with his satire , the monotonous glitter of his verse , and the want of profound purpose in his writings , combine to class him below the first file of poets . And vain are all attempts , such as those of Byron and Lord Carlisle , to alter the general verdict . It is very difficult , after a time , either to raise or depress an acknowledged classic ; and Pope must come , if he has not come already , to a peculiarly defined and strictly apportioned place on the shelf . He was unquestionably the poet of his age . But his age was far from being one of a lofty order : it was a low , languid , artificial , and lazily sceptical age . It loved to be tickled ; and Pope tickled it with the finger of a master . It liked to be lulled , at other times , into half-slumber ; and the soft and even monotonies of Pope 's pastorals and “ Windsor Forest ” effected this end . It loved to be suspended in a state of semi-doubt , swung to and fro in agreeable equipoise ; and the “ Essay on Man ” was precisely such a swing . It was fond of a mixture of strong English sense with French graces and charms of manner ; and Pope supplied it . It was fond of keen , yet artfully managed satire ; and Pope furnished it in abundance . It loved nothing that threatened greatly to disturb its equanimity or over-much to excite or arouse it ; and there was little of this in Pope . Had he been a really great poet of the old Homer or Dante breed , he would have outshot his age , till he “ dwindled in the distance ; ” but in lieu of immediate fame , and of elaborate lectures in the next century , to bolster it unduly up , all generations would have “ risen and called him blessed . ” We had intended some remarks on Pope as a prose-writer , and as a correspondent ; but want of space has compelled us to confine ourselves to his poetry .</docImprint>

Preface prefixed to the Five First imperfect Editions II . A List of Books , Papers , and Verses III . Advertisement to the First Edition IV . Advertisement to the First Edition of the Fourth Book V. Advertisement to the Complete Edition of<date>1743</date>VI . Advertisement printed in the Journals ,<date>1730</date>VII . A Parallel of the Characters of Mr Dryden and Mr Pope Index of Persons celebrated in this Poem MORAL ESSAYS . The ‘ Essay on Man ’ was intended to have been comprised in four books :— The first of which , the author has given us under that title , in four epistles . The second was to have consisted of the same number :— 1 . Of the extent and limits of human reason . 2 . Of those arts and sciences , and of the parts of them , which are useful , and therefore attainable , together with those which are unuseful , and therefore unattainable . 3 . Of the nature , ends , use , and application of the different capacities of men . 4 . Of the use of learning , of the science of the world , and of wit ; concluding with a satire against the misapplication of them , illustrated by pictures , characters , and examples . The third book regarded civil regimen , or the science of politics , in which the several forms of a republic were to have been examined and explained ; together with the several modes of religious worship , as far forth as they affect society ; between which the author always supposed there was the most interesting relation and closest connexion ; so that this part would have treated of civil and religious society in their full extent . The fourth and last book concerned private ethics or practical morality , considered in all the circumstances , orders , professions , and stations of human life . The scheme of all this had been maturely digested , and communicated to the Lord Bolingbroke , Dr Swift , and one or two more , and was intended for the only work of his riper years ; but was , partly through ill health , partly through discouragements from the depravity of the times , and partly on prudential and other considerations , interrupted , postponed , and , lastly , in a manner laid aside . But as this was the author 's favourite work , which more exactly reflected the image of his strong capacious mind , and as we can have but a very imperfect idea of it from the disjecta membra poetae that now remain , it may not be amiss to be a little more particular concerning each of these projected books . The first , as it treats of man in the abstract , and considers him in general under every one of his relations , becomes the foundation , and furnishes out the subjects , of the three following ; so that — The second book takes up again the first and second epistles of the first book , and treats of man in his intellectual capacity at large , as has been explained above . Of this , only a small part of the conclusion ( which , as we said , was to have contained a satire against the misapplication of wit and learning ) may be found in the fourth book of ‘ The Dunciad , ’ and up and down , occasionally , in the other three . The third book , in like manner , reassumes the subject of the third epistle of the first , which treats of man in his social , political , and religious capacity . But this part the poet afterwards conceived might be best executed in an epic poem ; as the action would make it more animated , and the fable less invidious ; in which all the great principles of true and false governments and religions should be chiefly delivered in feigned examples . The fourth and last book pursues the subject of the fourth epistle of the first , and treats of ethics , or practical morality ; and would have consisted of many members ; of which the four following epistles were detached portions : the two first , on the characters of men and women , being the introductory part of this concluding book .— Warburton . EPISTLE I .— TO SIR RICHARD TEMPLE , LORD COBHAM . ARGUMENT . OF THE KNOWLEDGE AND CHARACTERS OF MEN . That it is not sufficient for this knowledge to consider man in the abstract : books will not serve the purpose , nor yet our own experience singly , ver . 1 . General maxims , unless they be formed upon both , will be but notional , ver . 10 . Some peculiarity in every man , characteristic to himself , yet varying from himself , ver . 15 . Difficulties arising from our own passions , fancies , faculties , &amp; c ., ver . 31 . The shortness of life , to observe in , and the uncertainty of the principles of action in men , to observe by , ver . 37 , &amp; c. Our own principle of action often hid from ourselves , ver . 41 . Some few characters plain , but in general confounded , dissembled , or inconsistent , ver . 51 . The same man utterly different in different places and seasons , ver . 71 . Unimaginable weaknesses in the greatest , ver . 70 , &amp; c. Nothing constant and certain but God and nature , ver . 95 . No judging of the motives from the actions ; the same actions proceeding from contrary motives , and the same motives influencing contrary actions , ver . 100 . II . Yet to form characters , we can only take the strongest actions of a man 's life , and try to make them agree : the utter uncertainty of this , from nature itself , and from policy , ver . 120 . Characters given according to the rank of men of the world , ver . 135 . And some reason for it , ver . 140 . Education alters the nature , or at least character of many , ver . 149 . Actions , passions , opinions , manners , humours , or principles , all subject to change . No judging by nature , from ver . 158 to 174 . III . It only remains to find ( if we can ) his ruling passion : that will certainly influence all the rest , and can reconcile the seeming or real inconsistency of all his actions , ver . 175 . Instanced in the extraordinary character of Clodio , ver . 179 . A caution against mistaking second qualities for first , which will destroy all possibility of the knowledge of mankind , ver . 210 . Examples of the strength of the ruling passion , and its continuation to the last breath , ver . 222 , &amp; c. Yes , you despise the man to books confined , Who from his study rails at human kind ; Though what he learns he speaks , and may advance Some general maxims , or be right by chance . The coxcomb bird , so talkative and grave , That from his cage cries ‘ Cuckold , ’ ‘ Whore , ’ and ‘ Knave , ’ Though many a passenger he rightly call , You hold him no philosopher at all . And yet the fate of all extremes is such , Men may be read , as well as books , too much . 10 To observations which ourselves we make , We grow more partial for the observer 's sake ; To written wisdom , as another 's , less : Maxims are drawn from notions , those from guess . There 's some peculiar in each leaf and grain , Some unmark 'd fibre , or some varying vein : Shall only man be taken in the gross ? Grant but as many sorts of mind as moss . That each from other differs , first confess ; Next that he varies from himself no less : 20 Add nature 's , custom 's , reason 's , passion 's strife , And all opinion 's colours cast on life . Our depths who fathoms , or our shallows finds , Quick whirls , and shifting eddies , of our minds ? On human actions reason though you can , It may be reason , but it is not man : His principle of action once explore , That instant ‘ tis his principle no more . Like following life through creatures you dissect , You lose it in the moment you detect . 30 Yet more ; the difference is as great between The optics seeing , as the objects seen . All manners take a tincture from our own ; Or come discolour 'd , through our passions shown ; Or fancy 's beam enlarges , multiplies , Contracts , inverts , and gives ten thousand dyes . Nor will life 's stream for observation stay , It hurries all too fast to mark their way : In vain sedate reflections we would make , When half our knowledge we must snatch , not take . 40 Oft , in the passions ’ wild rotation toss 'd , Our spring of action to ourselves is lost : Tired , not determined , to the last we yield , And what comes then is master of the field . As the last image of that troubled heap , When sense subsides , and fancy sports in sleep , ( Though past the recollection of the thought ) , Becomes the stuff of which our dream is wrought : Something as dim to our internal view , Is thus , perhaps , the cause of most we do . 50 True , some are open , and to all men known ; Others so very close , they 're hid from none ; ( So darkness strikes the sense no less than light ) Thus gracious Chandos is beloved at sight ; And every child hates Shylock , though his soul Still sits at squat , and peeps not from its hole . At half mankind when generous Manly raves , All know ‘ tis virtue , for he thinks them knaves : When universal homage Umbra pays , All see ‘ tis vice , and itch of vulgar praise . 60 When flattery glares , all hate it in a queen , While one there is who charms us with his spleen . But these plain characters we rarely find ; Though strong the bent , yet quick the turns of mind : Or puzzling contraries confound the whole ; Or affectations quite reverse the soul . The dull , flat falsehood serves for policy ; And , in the cunning , truth itself 's a lie : Unthought-of frailties cheat us in the wise ; The fool lies hid in inconsistencies . 70 See the same man , in vigour , in the gout ; Alone , in company ; in place , or out ; Early at business , and at hazard late ; Mad at a fox-chase , wise at a debate ; Drunk at a borough , civil at a ball ; Friendly at Hackney , faithless at Whitehall . Catius is ever moral , ever grave , Thinks who endures a knave , is next a knave , Save just at dinner — then prefers , no doubt , A rogue with venison to a saint without . 80 Who would not praise Patricio 's<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>high desert , His hand unstain 'd , his uncorrupted heart , His comprehensive head , all interests weigh 'd , All Europe saved , yet Britain not betray 'd ? He thanks you not , his pride is in picquet , Newmarket fame , and judgment at a bet . What made ( says Montaigne , or more sage Charron [ 2 ]) Otho a warrior , Cromwell a buffoon ? A perjured prince<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>a leaden saint revere , A godless regent<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>tremble at a star ? 90 The throne a bigot keep , a genius quit , Faithless through piety , and duped through wit ? Europe a woman , child , or dotard rule , And just her wisest monarch made a fool ? Know , God and Nature only are the same : In man , the judgment shoots at flying game ; A bird of passage ! gone as soon as found , Now in the moon perhaps , now under ground . II . In vain the sage , with retrospective eye , Would from the apparent what conclude the why , 100 Infer the motive from the deed , and show That what we chanced was what we meant to do . Behold ! if fortune or a mistress frowns , Some plunge in business , others shave their crowns : To ease the soul of one oppressive weight , This quits an empire , that embroils a state : The same adust complexion has impell 'd Charles<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>to the convent , Philip<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>to the field . Not always actions show the man : we find Who does a kindness , is not therefore kind ; 110 Perhaps prosperity becalm 'd his breast , Perhaps the wind just shifted from the east : Not therefore humble he who seeks retreat , Pride guides his steps , and bids him shun the great : Who combats bravely is not therefore brave , He dreads a death-bed like the meanest slave : Who reasons wisely is not therefore wise , His pride in reasoning , not in acting , lies . But grant that actions best discover man ; Take the most strong , and sort them as you can : 120 The few that glare , each character must mark , You balance not the many in the dark . What will you do with such as disagree ? Suppress them , or miscall them policy ? Must then at once ( the character to save ) The plain rough hero turn a crafty knave ? Alas ! in truth the man but changed his mind , Perhaps was sick , in love , or had not dined . Ask why from Britain Cæsar would retreat ? Cæsar himself might whisper he was beat . 130 Why risk the world 's great empire for a punk ?<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>Cæsar perhaps might answer he was drunk . But , sage historians ! ‘ tis your task to prove One action , conduct ; one , heroic love . ‘ Tis from high life high characters are drawn ; A saint in crape is twice a saint in lawn ; A judge is just , a chancellor juster still ; A gownman , learn 'd ; a bishop , what you will ; Wise , if a minister ; but , if a king , More wise , more learn 'd , more just , more everything , 140 Court-virtues bear , like gems , the highest rate , Born where Heaven 's influence scarce can penetrate : In life 's low vale , the soil the virtues like , They please as beauties , here as wonders strike . Though the same sun with all-diffusive rays Blush in the rose , and in the diamond blaze , We prize the stronger effort of his power , And justly set the gem above the flower . ‘ Tis education forms the common mind , Just as the twig is bent , the tree 's inclined . 150 Boastful and rough , your first son is a squire ; The next a tradesman , meek , and much a liar ; Tom struts a soldier , open , bold , and brave ; Will sneaks a scrivener , an exceeding knave : Is he a Churchman ? then he 's fond of power : A Quaker ? sly : A Presbyterian ? sour : A smart free-thinker ? all things in an hour . Ask men 's opinions : Scoto now shall tell How trade increases , and the world goes well ; Strike off his pension , by the setting sun , 160 And Britain , if not Europe , is undone . That gay free-thinker , a fine talker once , What turns him now a stupid silent dunce ? Some god , or spirit he has lately found ; Or chanced to meet a minister that frown 'd .</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>Judge we by nature ? Habit can efface , Interest o'ercome , or policy take place : By actions ? those uncertainty divides : By passions ? these dissimulation hides : Opinions ? they still take a wider range : 170 Find , if you can , in what you cannot change . Manners with fortunes , humours turn with climes , Tenets with books , and principles with times . III . Search , then , the ruling passion : there , alone , The wild are constant , and the cunning known ; The fool consistent , and the false sincere ; Priests , princes , women , no dissemblers here . This clue once found , unravels all the rest , The prospect clears , and Wharton stands confess 'd . Wharton , the scorn and wonder of our days , 180 Whose ruling passion was the lust of praise : Born with whate'er could win it from the wise , Women and fools must like him or he dies ; Though wondering senates hung on all he spoke , The club must hail him master of the joke . Shall parts so various aim at nothing new ? He 'll shine a Tully and a Wilmot<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>too . Then turns repentant , and his God adores With the same spirit that he drinks and whores ; Enough if all around him but admire , 190 And now the punk applaud , and now the friar . Thus with each gift of nature and of art , And wanting nothing but an honest heart ; Grown all to all , from no one vice exempt ; And most contemptible , to shun contempt ; His passion still to covet general praise , His life , to forfeit it a thousand ways ; A constant bounty which no friend has made ; An angel tongue , which no man can persuade ; A fool , with more of wit than half mankind , 200 Too rash for thought , for action too refined ; A tyrant to the wife his heart approves ; A rebel to the very king he loves ; He dies , sad outcast of each church and state , And , harder still ! flagitious , yet not great . Ask you why Wharton broke through every rule ‘ Twas all for fear the knaves should call him fool . Nature well known , no prodigies remain , Comets are regular , and Wharton plain . Yet , in this search , the wisest may mistake , 210 If second qualities for first they take . When Catiline by rapine swell 'd his store ; When Cæsar made a noble dame a whore ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>In this the lust , in that the avarice Were means , not ends ; ambition was the vice . That very Cæsar , born in Scipio 's days , Had aim 'd , like him , by chastity at praise . Lucullus , when frugality could charm , Had roasted turnips in the Sabine farm . In vain the observer eyes the builder 's toil , 220 But quite mistakes the scaffold for the pile . In this one passion man can strength enjoy , As fits give vigour , just when they destroy . Time , that on all things lays his lenient hand , Yet tames not this ; it sticks to our last sand . Consistent in our follies and our sins , Here honest Nature ends as she begins . Old politicians chew on wisdom past , And totter on in business to the last ; As weak , as earnest , and as gravely out , 230 As sober Lanesborough<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>dancing in the gout .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>Behold a reverend sire , whom want of grace Has made the father of a nameless race , Shoved from the wall perhaps , or rudely press 'd By his own son , that passes by unbless 'd : Still to his wench he crawls on knocking knees , And envies every sparrow that he sees . A salmon 's belly , Helluo , was thy fate ; The doctor call 'd , declares all help too late : ‘ Mercy ! ’ cries Helluo , ‘ mercy on my soul ! 240 Is there no hope ? Alas ! then bring the jowl . ’ The frugal crone , whom praying priests attend , Still tries to save the hallow 'd taper 's end , Collects her breath , as ebbing life retires , For one puff more , and in that puff expires . ‘ Odious ! in woollen ! ‘ twould a saint provoke , ’ ( Were the last words that poor Narcissa<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>spoke ) , ‘ No , let a charming chintz and Brussels lace Wrap my cold limbs , and shade my lifeless face : One would not , sure , be frightful when one 's dead — 250 And , Betty , give this cheek a little red . ’ The courtier smooth , who forty years had shined An humble servant to all human kind , Just brought out this , when scarce his tongue could stir , ‘ If — where I 'm going — I could serve you , sir ? ’ ‘ I give and I devise ’ ( old Euclio said , And sigh 'd ) ‘ my lands and tenements to Ned . ’ ‘ Your money , sir ? ’ ‘ My money , sir , what ! all ? Why — if I must ’ — ( then wept ) — ‘ I give it Paul . ’ ‘ The manor , sir ? ’ — ‘ The manor ! hold , ’ ( he cried ) , 260 ‘ Not that — I cannot part with that ’ — and died . And you , brave Cobham ! to the latest breath Shall feel your ruling passion strong in death : Such in those moments as in all the past , ‘ Oh , save my country , Heaven ! ’ shall be your last .

Nothing so true as what you once let fall — ‘ Most women have no characters at all . ’ Matter too soft a lasting mark to bear , And best distinguish 'd by black , brown , or fair . How many pictures of one nymph we view , All how unlike each other , all how true ! Arcadia 's Countess , here , in ermined pride , Is there , Pastora by a fountain side . Here Fannia , leering on her own good man , And there , a naked Leda with a swan . 10 Let then the fair one beautifully cry , In Magdalen 's loose hair and lifted eye , Or dress 'd in smiles of sweet Cecilia shine , With simpering angels , palms , and harps divine ; Whether the charmer sinner it or saint it , If folly grow romantic , I must paint it . Come then , the colours and the ground prepare ! Dip in the rainbow , trick her off in air ; Choose a firm cloud , before it fall , and in it Catch , ere she change , the Cynthia of this minute . 20 Rufa , whose eye quick glancing o'er the park , Attracts each light gay meteor of a spark , Agrees as ill with Rufa studying Locke , As Sappho 's<span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span>diamonds with her dirty smock ; Or Sappho at her toilet 's greasy task , With Sappho fragrant at an evening mask : So morning insects that in muck begun , Shine , buzz , and fly-blow in the setting sun . How soft is Silia ! fearful to offend ; The frail one 's advocate , the weak one 's friend : 30 To her , Calista proved her conduct nice ; And good Simplicius asks of her advice . Sudden , she storms ! she raves ! You tip the wink , But spare your censure — Silia does not drink . All eyes may see from what the change arose , All eyes may see — a pimple on her nose . Papillia , wedded to her amorous spark , Sighs for the shades — ‘ How charming is a park ! ’ A park is purchased , but the fair he sees All bathed in tears — ‘ Oh odious , odious trees ! ’ 40 Ladies , like variegated tulips , show , ‘ Tis to their changes half their charms we owe ; Fine by defect , and delicately weak , Their happy spots the nice admirer take . ‘ Twas thus Calypso once each heart alarm 'd , Awed without virtue , without beauty charm 'd ; Her tongue bewitch 'd as oddly as her eyes , Less wit than mimic , more a wit than wise ; Strange graces still , and stranger flights she had , Was just not ugly , and was just not mad ; 50 Yet ne'er so sure our passion to create , As when she touch 'd the brink of all we hate . Narcissa 's<span type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span>nature , tolerably mild , To make a wash , would hardly stew a child ; Has even been proved to grant a lover 's prayer , And paid a tradesman once , to make him stare ; Gave alms at Easter , in a Christian trim , And made a widow happy , for a whim . Why then declare good-nature is her scorn , When ‘ tis by that alone she can be borne 60 Why pique all mortals , yet affect a name ? A fool to pleasure , yet a slave to fame : Now deep in Taylor and the Book of Martyrs , Now drinking citron with his Grace and Chartres : Now conscience chills her , and now passion burns ; And atheism and religion take their turns ; A very heathen in the carnal part , Yet still a sad , good Christian at her heart . See Sin in state , majestically drunk ; Proud as a peeress , prouder as a punk ; 70 Chaste to her husband , frank to all beside , A teeming mistress , but a barren bride . What then ? let blood and body bear the fault , Her head 's untouch 'd , that noble seat of thought : Such this day 's doctrine — in another fit She sins with poets through pure love of wit . What has not fired her bosom or her brain — Cæsar and Tall-boy , Charles and Charlemagne ? As Helluo , late dictator of the feast , The nose of haut goût , and the tip of taste , 80 Critiqued your wine , and analysed your meat , Yet on plain pudding deign 'd at home to eat ; So Philomedé ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 14 ]</span>lecturing all mankind On the soft passion and the taste refined , The address , the delicacy — stoops at once , And makes her hearty meal upon a dunce . Flavia 's a wit , has too much sense to pray ; To toast our wants and wishes , is her way ; Nor asks of God , but of her stars , to give The mighty blessing , ‘ While we live , to live . ’ 90 Then all for death , that opiate of the soul ! Lucretia 's dagger , Rosamonda 's bowl . Say , what can cause such impotence of mind ? A spark too fickle , or a spouse too kind . Wise wretch ! with pleasures too refined to please ; With too much spirit to be e'er at ease ; With too much quickness ever to be taught ; With too much thinking to have common thought : You purchase pain with all that joy can give , And die of nothing , but a rage to live . 100 Turn then from wits ; and look on Simo 's mate , No ass so meek , no ass so obstinate . Or her , that owns her faults , but never mends , Because she 's honest , and the best of friends . Or her , whose life the church and scandal share , For ever in a passion or a prayer . Or her , who laughs at hell , but ( like her Grace [ 15 ]) Cries , ‘ Ah ! how charming , if there 's no such place ! ’ Or who in sweet vicissitude appears Of mirth and opium , ratafia and tears , 110 The daily anodyne , and nightly draught , To kill those foes to fair ones — time and thought . Woman and fool are two hard things to hit ; For true no-meaning puzzles more than wit .</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>But what are these to great Atossa 's<span type="note_anchor">[ 16 ]</span>mind ? Scarce once herself , by turns all womankind ! Who , with herself , or others , from her birth Finds all her life one warfare upon earth : Shines , in exposing knaves , and painting fools , Yet is whate'er she hates and ridicules . 120 No thought advances , but her eddy brain Whisks it about , and down it goes again . Full sixty years the world has been her trade , The wisest fool much time has ever made . From loveless youth to uninspected age , No passion gratified , except her rage . So much the fury still outran the wit , The pleasure miss 'd her , and the scandal hit . Who breaks with her , provokes revenge from hell , But he 's a bolder man who dares be well . 130 Her every turn with violence pursued , Nor more a storm her hate than gratitude : To that each passion turns , or soon or late ; Love , if it makes her yield , must make her hate : Superiors ? death ! and equals ? what a curse ! But an inferior not dependent ? worse ! Offend her , and she knows not to forgive : Oblige her , and she 'll hate you while you live : But die , and she 'll adore you — then the bust And temple rise — then fall again to dust . 140 Last night , her lord was all that 's good and great : A knave this morning , and his will a cheat . Strange ! by the means defeated of the ends , By spirit robb 'd of power , by warmth of friends , By wealth of followers ! without one distress , Sick of herself through very selfishness ! Atossa , cursed with every granted prayer , Childless with all her children , wants an heir . To heirs unknown descends the unguarded store , Or wanders , Heaven-directed , to the poor . 150 Pictures like these , dear Madam , to design , Asks no firm hand , and no unerring line ; Some wandering touches , some reflected light , Some flying stroke alone can hit ‘ em right : For how should equal colours do the knack ? Chameleons who can paint in white and black ? ‘ Yet Chloe , sure , was form 'd without a spot ’ — Nature in her then err 'd not , but forgot . ‘ With every pleasing , every prudent part , Say , what can Chloe<span type="note_anchor">[ 17 ]</span>want ? ’ — She wants a heart . 160 She speaks , behaves , and acts just as she ought ; But never , never reach 'd one generous thought . Virtue she finds too painful an endeavour , Content to dwell in decencies for ever . So very reasonable , so unmoved , As never yet to love , or to be loved . She , while her lover pants upon her breast , Can mark the figures on an Indian chest ; And when she sees her friend in deep despair , Observes how much a chintz exceeds mohair . 170 Forbid it , Heaven ! a favour or a debt She e'er should cancel — but she may forget . Safe is your secret still in Chloe 's ear ; But none of Chloe 's shall you ever hear . Of all her dears she never slander 'd one , But cares not if a thousand are undone . Would Chloe know if you 're alive or dead ? She bids her footman put it in her head . Chloe is prudent — would you , too , be wise ? Then never break your heart when Chloe dies . 180 One certain portrait may ( I grant ) be seen , Which Heaven has varnish 'd out , and made a queen : The same for ever ! and described by all With truth and goodness , as with crown and ball . Poets heap virtues , painters gems at will , And show their zeal , and hide their want of skill . ‘ Tis well — but , artists ! who can paint or write , To draw the naked is your true delight . That robe of quality so struts and swells , None see what parts of nature it conceals : 190 The exactest traits of body or of mind , We owe to models of an humble kind . If Queensberry to strip there 's no compelling , ‘ Tis from a handmaid we must take an Helen From peer or bishop ‘ tis no easy thing To draw the man who loves his God , or king : Alas ! I copy ( or my draught would fail ) From honest Mahomet<span type="note_anchor">[ 18 ]</span>, or plain Parson Hale .<span type="note_anchor">[ 19 ]</span>But grant , in public men sometimes are shown , A woman 's seen in private life alone : 200 Our bolder talents in full light display 'd ; Your virtues open fairest in the shade . Bred to disguise , in public ‘ tis you hide ; There , none distinguish ‘ twixt your shame or pride , Weakness or delicacy ; all so nice , That each may seem a virtue , or a vice . In men , we various ruling passions find ; In women , two almost divide the kind ; Those , only fix 'd , they first or last obey , The love of pleasure , and the love of sway . 210 That , Nature gives ; and where the lesson taught Is but to please , can pleasure seem a fault ? Experience , this ; by man 's oppression curst , They seek the second not to lose the first . Men , some to business , some to pleasure take ; But every woman is at heart a rake : Men , some to quiet , some to public strife ; But every lady would be queen for life . Yet mark the fate of a whole sex of queens ! Power all their end , but beauty all the means : 220 In youth they conquer , with so wild a rage , As leaves them scarce a subject in their age : For foreign glory , foreign joy , they roam ; No thought of peace or happiness at home . But wisdom 's triumph is well-timed retreat , As hard a science to the fair as great ! Beauties , like tyrants , old and friendless grown , Yet hate repose , and dread to be alone , Worn out in public , weary every eye , Nor leave one sigh behind them when they die . 230 Pleasure the sex , as children birds , pursue , Still out of reach , yet never out of view ; Sure , if they catch , to spoil the toy at most , To covet flying , and regret when lost : At last , to follies youth could scarce defend , It grows their age 's prudence to pretend ; Ashamed to own they gave delight before , Reduced to feign it , when they give no more : As hags hold Sabbaths , less for joy than spite , So these their merry , miserable night ; 240 Still round and round the ghosts of beauty glide , And haunt the places where their honour died . See how the world its veterans rewards ! A youth of frolics , an old age of cards ; Fair to no purpose , artful to no end , Young without lovers , old without a friend ; A fop their passion , but their prize a sot , Alive , ridiculous ; and dead , forgot ! Ah , friend ! to dazzle let the vain design ; To raise the thought , and touch the heart , be thine ! 250 That charm shall grow , while what fatigues the ring , Flaunts and goes down , an unregarded thing : So when the sun 's broad beam has tired the sight , All mild ascends the moon 's more sober light , Serene in virgin modesty she shines , And unobserved the glaring orb declines . Oh ! bless 'd with temper , whose unclouded ray Can make to-morrow cheerful as to-day ; She , who can love a sister 's charms , or hear Sighs for a daughter with unwounded ear ; 260 She , who ne'er answers till a husband cools , Or , if she rales him , never shows she rules ; Charms by accepting , by submitting sways , Yet has her humour most when she obeys ; Let fops or fortune fly which way they will ; Disdains all loss of tickets , or codille ; Spleen , vapours , or small-pox , above them all , And mistress of herself though China fall . And yet , believe me , good as well as ill , Woman 's at best a contradiction still . 270 Heaven , when it strives to polish all it can Its last , best work , but forms a softer man ; Picks from each sex , to make the favourite blest , Your love of pleasure or desire of rest : Blends , in exception to all general rules , Your taste of follies , with our scorn of fools : Reserve with frankness , art with truth allied , Courage with softness , modesty with pride ; Fix 'd principles , with fancy ever new ; Shakes all together , and produces — you . 280 Be this a woman 's fame : with this unbless 'd , Toasts live a scorn , and queens may die a jest . This Phoebus promised ( I forget the year ) When those blue eyes first open 'd on the sphere ; Ascendant Phoebus watch 'd that hour with care , Averted half your parents ’ simple prayer ; And gave you beauty , but denied the pelf That buys your sex a tyrant o'er itself . The generous god , who wit and gold refines , And ripens spirits as he ripens mines , 290 Kept dross for duchesses , the world shall know it , To you gave sense , good-humour , and a poet .

P. Who shall decide , when doctors disagree , And soundest casuists doubt , like you and me ? You hold the word , from Jove to Momus given , That man was made the standing jest of Heaven ; And gold but sent to keep the fools in play , For some to heap , and some to throw away . But I , who think more highly of our kind , ( And , surely , Heaven and I are of a mind ) Opine , that Nature , as in duty bound , Deep hid the shining mischief under ground : 10 But when , by man 's audacious labour won , Flamed forth this rival to its sire , the Sun , Then careful Heaven supplied two sorts of men , To squander these , and those to hide again . Like doctors thus , when much dispute has pass 'd , We find our tenets just the same at last . Both fairly owning , riches , in effect , No grace of Heaven or token of the elect ; Given to the fool , the mad , the vain , the evil , To Ward ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 21 ]</span>to Waters , Chartres ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 22 ]</span>and the devil . 20 B .

What could they more than knights and squires confound , Or water all the quorum ten miles round ? A statesman 's slumbers how this speech would spoil ! ‘ Sir , Spain has sent a thousand jars of oil ; Huge bales of British cloth blockade the door ; A hundred oxen at your leveë roar . ’ Poor avarice one torment more would find ; Nor could profusion squander all in kind . 60 Astride his cheese , Sir Morgan might we meet ; And Worldly crying coals<span type="note_anchor">[ 25 ]</span>from street to street , Whom , with a wig so wild , and mien so mazed , Pity mistakes for some poor tradesman crazed .

Much-injured Blunt !<span type="note_anchor">[ 36 ]</span>why bears he Britain 's hate ? A wizard told him in these words our fate : ‘ At length corruption , like a general flood , ( So long by watchful ministers withstood ) Shall deluge all ; and avarice creeping on , Spread like a low-born mist , and blot the sun , Statesman and patriot ply alike the stocks , Peeress and butler share alike the box , 140 And judges job , and bishops bite the town , And mighty dukes pack cards for half-a-crown . See Britain sunk in lucre 's sordid charms , And France revenged of Anne 's and Edward 's arms ! ’ ‘ Twas no court-badge , great scrivener ! fired thy brain , Nor lordly luxury , nor city gain : No , ‘ twas thy righteous end , ashamed to see Senates degenerate , patriots disagree , And nobly wishing party-rage to cease , To buy both sides , and give thy country peace . 150 ‘ All this is madness , ’ cries a sober sage : But who , my friend , has reason in his rage ? ‘ The ruling passion , be it what it will , The ruling passion conquers reason still . ’ Less mad the wildest whimsy we can frame , Than even that passion , if it has no aim ; For though such motives folly you may call , The folly 's greater to have none at all . Hear , then , the truth : ‘'Tis Heaven each passion sends , And different men directs to different ends . 160 Extremes in Nature equal good produce , Extremes in man concur to general use . ’ Ask we what makes one keep , and one bestow ? That Power who bids the ocean ebb and flow , Bids seed-time , harvest , equal course maintain , Through reconciled extremes of drought and rain . Builds life on death , on change duration founds , And gives the eternal wheels to know their rounds . Riches , like insects , when conceal 'd they lie , Wait but for wings , and in their season fly . 170 Who sees pale Mammon pine amidst his store , Sees but a backward steward for the poor ; This year a reservoir , to keep and spare ; The next a fountain , spouting through his heir , In lavish streams to quench a country 's thirst , And men and dogs shall drink him till they burst . Old Cotta shamed his fortune and his birth , Yet was not Cotta void of wit or worth : What though ( the use of barbarous spits forgot ) His kitchen vied in coolness with his grot ? 180 His court with nettles , moats with cresses stored , With soups unbought and salads bless 'd his board ? If Cotta lived on pulse , it was no more Than Brahmins , saints , and sages did before ; To cram the rich was prodigal expense , And who would take the poor from Providence ? Like some lone Chartreux stands the good old Hall , Silence without , and fasts within the wall ; No rafter 'd roofs with dance and tabor sound , No noontide-bell invites the country round : 190 Tenants with sighs the smokeless towers survey , And turn the unwilling steeds another way : Benighted wanderers , the forest o'er , Curse the saved candle , and unopening door ; While the gaunt mastiff growling at the gate , Affrights the beggar whom he longs to eat . Not so his son ; he mark 'd this oversight , And then mistook reverse of wrong for right . ( For what to shun will no great knowledge need , But what to follow , is a task indeed ) . 200 Yet sure , of qualities deserving praise , More go to ruin fortunes , than to raise . What slaughter 'd hecatombs , what floods of wine , Fill the capacious squire , and deep divine ! Yet no mean motive this profusion draws , His oxen perish in his country 's cause ; ‘ Tis George and Liberty that crowns the cup , And zeal for that great house which eats him up . The woods recede around the naked seat , The silvans groan — no matter — for the fleet ; 210 Next goes his wool — to clothe our valiant bands , Last , for his country 's love , he sells his lands . To town he comes , completes the nation 's hope , And heads the bold train-bands , and burns a pope . And shall not Britain now reward his toils , Britain , that pays her patriots with her spoils ? In vain at court the bankrupt pleads his cause , His thankless country leaves him to her laws . The sense to value riches , with the art To enjoy them , and the virtue to impart , 220 Not meanly , nor ambitiously pursued , Not sunk by sloth , nor raised by servitude : To balance fortune by a just expense , Join with economy , magnificence ; With splendour , charity ; with plenty , health ; Oh teach us , Bathurst ! yet unspoil 'd by wealth ! That secret rare , between the extremes to move Of mad good-nature and of mean self-love . B . To worth or want well-weigh 'd , be bounty given , And ease , or emulate , the care of Heaven ; 230 ( Whose measure full o'erflows on human race ) Mend Fortune 's fault , and justify her grace . Wealth in the gross is death , but life , diffused ; As poison heals , in just proportion used : In heaps , like ambergris , a stink it lies , But well-dispersed , is incense to the skies .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>P. Who starves by nobles , or with nobles eats ? The wretch that trusts them , and the rogue that cheats .

Not to the skies in useless columns toss 'd , Or in proud falls magnificently lost , But clear and artless pouring through the plain Health to the sick , and solace to the swain . Whose causeway parts the vale with shady rows ? Whose seats the weary traveller repose ? 260 Who taught that heaven-directed spire to rise ? ‘ The Man of Ross , ’ each lisping babe replies . Behold the market-place with poor o'erspread ! The Man of Ross divides the weekly bread : He feeds yon alms-house , neat , but void of state , Where Age and Want sit smiling at the gate : Him portion 'd maids , apprenticed orphans bless 'd , The young who labour , and the old who rest . Is any sick ? the Man of Ross relieves , Prescribes , attends , the medicine makes , and gives . 270 Is there a variance ? enter but his door , Balk 'd are the courts , and contest is no more .

In the worst inn 's worst room , with mat half-hung , The floors of plaster , and the walls of dung , 300 On once a flock-bed , but repair 'd with straw , With tape-tied curtains , never meant to draw , The George and Garter dangling from that bed Where tawdry yellow strove with dirty red , Great Villiers<span type="note_anchor">[ 41 ]</span>lies — alas ! how changed from him , That life of pleasure , and that soul of whim ! Gallant and gay , in Cliveden 's proud alcove , The bower of wanton Shrewsbury ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 42 ]</span>and love ; Or just as gay , at council , in a ring Of mimick 'd statesmen , and their merry king . 310 No wit to flatter , left of all his store ; No fool to laugh at , which he valued more . There , victor of his health , of fortune , friends , And fame , this lord of useless thousands ends . His Grace 's fate sage Cutler<span type="note_anchor">[ 43 ]</span>could foresee , And well ( he thought ) advised him , ‘ Live like me . ’ As well his Grace replied , ‘ Like you , Sir John ? That I can do , when all I have is gone . ’ Resolve me , Reason , which of these is worse , Want with a full , or with an empty purse ? 320 Thy life more wretched , Cutler , was confess 'd , Arise , and tell me , was thy death more bless 'd ? Cutler saw tenants break , and houses fall ; For very want he could not build a wall . His only daughter in a stranger 's power ; For very want he could not pay a dower . A few gray hairs his reverend temples crown 'd , ‘ Twas very want that sold them for two pound . What even denied a cordial at his end , Banish 'd the doctor , and expell 'd the friend ? 330 What but a want , which you perhaps think mad , Yet numbers feel — the want of what he had ! Cutler and Brutus , dying , both exclaim , ‘ Virtue ! and Wealth ! what are ye but a name ! ’ Say , for such worth are other worlds prepared Or are they both in this their own reward ? A knotty point ! to which we now proceed . But you are tired — I 'll tell a tale — B . Agreed . P. Where<settlement>London</settlement>'s column ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 44 ]</span>pointing at the skies Like a tall bully , lifts the head , and lies ; 340 There dwelt a citizen of sober fame , A plain good man , and Balaam was his name ; Religious , punctual , frugal , and so forth ; His word would pass for more than he was worth . One solid dish his week-day meal affords , An added pudding solemnised the Lord 's : Constant at church , and ‘ Change ; his gains were sure , His givings rare , save farthings to the poor . The devil was piqued such saintship to behold , And long 'd to tempt him like good Job of old : 350 But Satan now is wiser than of yore , And tempts by making rich , not making poor . Roused by the Prince of Air , the whirlwinds sweep The surge , and plunge his father in the deep ; Then lull against his Cornish lands they roar , And two rich shipwrecks bless the lucky shore . Sir Balaam now , he lives like other folks , He takes his chirping pint , and cracks his jokes : ‘ Live like yourself , ’ was soon my Lady 's word ; And , lo ! two puddings smoked upon the board . 360 Asleep and naked as an Indian lay , An honest factor stole a gem away : He pledged it to the knight ; the knight had wit , So kept the diamond , and the rogue was bit . Some scruple rose , but thus he eased his thought — ‘ I 'll now give sixpence where I gave a groat ; Where once I went to church , I 'll now go twice — And am so clear , too , of all other vice . ’ The Tempter saw his time ; the work he plied ; Stocks and subscriptions pour on every side , 370 Till all the demon makes his full descent In one abundant shower of cent , per cent . ; Sinks deep within him , and possesses whole , Then dubs director , and secures his soul . Behold Sir Balaam , now a man of spirit , Ascribes his gettings to his parts and merit ; What late he call 'd a blessing , now was wit , And God 's good providence , a lucky hit . Things change their titles , as our manners turn : His counting-house employ 'd the Sunday-morn ; 380 Seldom at church ( ‘ twas such a busy life ) But duly sent his family and wife . There ( so the devil ordain 'd ) one Christmas-tide , My good old lady catch 'd a cold , and died . A nymph of quality admires our knight ; He marries , bows at court , and grows polite : Leaves the dull cits , and joins ( to please the fair ) The well-bred cuckolds in St James 's air : First , for his son a gay commission buys , Who drinks , whores , fights , and in a duel dies : 390 His daughter flaunts a viscount 's tawdry wife ; She bears a coronet and pox for life . In Britain 's senate he a seat obtains , And one more pensioner St Stephen gains . My lady falls to play ; so bad her chance , He must repair it ; takes a bribe from<country>France</country>; The House impeach him ; Coningsby harangues ; The court forsake him — and Sir Balaam hangs : Wife , son , and daughter , Satan ! are thy own , His wealth , yet dearer , forfeit to the crown : 400 The devil and the king divide the prize , And sad Sir Balaam curses God , and dies .

OF THE USE OF RICHES . The vanity of expense in people of wealth and quality . The abuse of the word ‘ taste , ’ ver . 13 . That the first principle and foundation , in this as in every thing else , is good sense , ver . 40 . The chief proof of it is to follow nature , even in works of mere luxury and elegance . Instanced in architecture and gardening , where all must be adapted to the genius and use of the place , and the beauties not forced into it , but resulting from it , ver . 50 . How men are disappointed in their most expensive undertakings , for want of this true foundation , without which nothing can please long , if at all ; and the best examples and rules will but be perverted into something burdensome or ridiculous , ver . 65 to 92 . A description of the false taste of magnificence ; the first grand error of which is to imagine that greatness consists in the size and dimension , instead of the proportion and harmony of the whole , ver . 97 ; and the second , either in joining together parts incoherent , or too minutely resembling , or in the repetition of the same too frequently , ver . 105 , &amp; c. A word or two of false taste in books , in music , in painting , even in preaching and prayer , and lastly in entertainments , ver . 133 , &amp; c. Yet Providence is justified in giving wealth to be squandered in this manner , since it is dispersed to the poor and laborious part of mankind , ver . 169 [ recurring to what is laid down in the ‘ Essay on Man , ’ ep . ii . and in the epistle preceding this , ver . 159 , &amp; c .] What are the proper objects of magnificence , and a proper field for the expense of great men , ver . 177 , &amp; c .; and finally , the great and public works which become a prince , ver . 191 , to the end . ‘ Tis strange , the miser should his cares employ To gain those riches he can ne'er enjoy : Is it less strange , the prodigal should waste His wealth , to purchase what he ne'er can taste ? Not for himself he sees , or hears , or eats ; Artists must choose his pictures , music , meats ; He buys for Topham<span type="note_anchor">[ 45 ]</span>drawings and designs , For Pembroke statues , dirty gods , and coins ; Rare monkish manuscripts for Hearne<span type="note_anchor">[ 46 ]</span>alone , And books for Mead , and butterflies for Sloane . 10 Think we all these are for himself ? no more Than his fine wife , alas ! or finer whore . For what has Virro painted , built , and planted ? Only to show how many tastes he wanted . What brought Sir Visto 's ill-got wealth to waste ? Some demon whisper 'd , ‘ Visto ! have a taste . ’ Heaven visits with a taste the wealthy fool , And needs no rod but Ripley<span type="note_anchor">[ 47 ]</span>with a rule . See ! sportive fate , to punish awkward pride , Bids Bubo<span type="note_anchor">[ 48 ]</span>build , and sends him such a guide : 20 A standing sermon , at each year 's expense , That never coxcomb reach 'd magnificence ! You show us , Rome was glorious , not profuse , And pompous buildings once were things of use . Yet shall ( my lord ) your just , your noble rules Fill half the land with imitating fools , Who random drawings from your sheets shall take , And of one beauty many blunders make ; Load some vain church with old theatric state , Turn arcs of triumph to a garden-gate ; 30 Reverse your ornaments , and hang them all On some patch 'd dog-hole eked with ends of wall ; Then clap four slices of pilaster o n't , That , laced with bits of rustic , makes a front . Shall call the winds through long arcades to roar , Proud to catch cold at a Venetian door ; Conscious they act a true Palladian part . And if they starve , they starve by rules of art . Oft have you hinted to your brother peer , A certain truth , which many buy too dear : 40 Something there is more needful than expense , And something previous even to taste — ‘ tis sense : Good sense , which only is the gift of Heaven , And though no science , fairly worth the seven : A light , which in yourself you must perceive ; Jones and Le Nôtre have it not to give . To build , to plant , whatever you intend , To rear the column , or the arch to bend , To swell the terrace , or to sink the grot ; In all , let Nature never be forgot . 50 But treat the goddess like a modest fair , Nor overdress , nor leave her wholly bare ; Let not each beauty everywhere be spied , Where half the skill is decently to hide . He gains all points , who pleasingly confounds , Surprises , varies , and conceals the bounds . Consult the genius of the place in all ; That tells the waters or to rise , or fall ; Or helps the ambitious hill the heavens to scale , Or scoops in circling theatres the vale ; 60 Calls in the country , catches opening glades , Joins willing woods , and varies shades from shades ; Now breaks , or now directs , the intending lines ; Paints as you plant , and , as you work , designs . Still follow sense , of every art the soul , Parts answering parts shall slide into a whole , Spontaneous beauties all around advance , Start even from difficulty , strike from chance ; Nature shall join you ; time shall make it grow A work to wonder at — perhaps a Stowe . 70 Without it , proud Versailles ! thy glory falls ; And Nero 's terraces desert their walls : The vast parterres a thousand hands shall make , Lo ! Cobham comes , and floats them with a lake : Or cut wide views through mountains to the plain , You 'll wish your hill or shelter 'd seat again . Even in an ornament its place remark , Nor in an hermitage set Dr Clarke .<span type="note_anchor">[ 49 ]</span>Behold Villario 's ten years ’ toil complete ; His quincunx darkens , his espaliers meet ; 80 The wood supports the plain , the parts unite , And strength of shade contends with strength of light ; A waving glow the blooming beds display , Blushing in bright diversities of day , With silver-quivering rills meander 'd o'er — Enjoy them , you ! Villario can no more ; Tired of the scene parterres and fountains yield , He finds at last he better likes a field . Through his young woods how pleased Sabinus stray 'd , Or sat delighted in the thickening shade , 90 With annual joy the reddening shoots to greet , Or see the stretching branches long to meet ! His son 's fine taste an opener vista loves , Foe to the Dryads of his father 's groves ; One boundless green , or flourish 'd carpet views , With all the mournful family of yews ; The thriving plants , ignoble broomsticks made , Now sweep those alleys they were born to shade . At Timon 's villa<span type="note_anchor">[ 50 ]</span>let us pass a day , Where all cry out , ‘ What sums are thrown away ! ’ 100 So proud , so grand ; of that stupendous air , Soft and agreeable come never there . Greatness , with Timon , dwells in such a draught As brings all Brobdignag before your thought . To compass this , his building is a town , His pond an ocean , his parterre a down : Who but must laugh , the master when he sees , A puny insect , shivering at a breeze ! Lo , what huge heaps of littleness around ! The whole a labour 'd quarry above ground ; 110 Two Cupids squirt before : a lake behind Improves the keenness of the northern wind . His gardens next your admiration call , On every side you look , behold the wall ! No pleasing intricacies intervene , No artful wildness to perplex the scene ; Grove nods at grove , each alley has a brother , And half the platform just reflects the other . The suffering eye inverted nature sees , Trees cut to statues , statues thick as trees ; 120 With here a fountain , never to be play 'd ; And there a summer-house , that knows no shade ; Here Amphitritè sails through myrtle bowers ; There gladiators fight , or die in flowers ; Unwater 'd see the drooping sea-horse mourn , And swallows roost in Nilus ’ dusty urn . My lord advances with majestic mien , Smit with the mighty pleasure , to be seen : But soft — by regular approach — not yet — First through the length of yon hot terrace sweat ; 130 And when up ten steep slopes you 've dragg 'd your thighs , Just at his study-door he 'll bless your eyes . His study ! with what authors is it stored ? In books , not authors , curious is my lord ; To all their dated backs he turns you round : These Aldus printed , those Du Sueil has bound . Lo ! some are vellum , and the rest as good For all his lordship knows , but they are wood . For Locke or Milton ‘ tis in vain to look , 140 These shelves admit not any modern book . And now the chapel 's silver bell you hear , That summons you to all the pride of prayer : Light quirks of music , broken and uneven , Make the soul dance upon a jig to heaven . On painted ceilings you devoutly stare , Where sprawl the saints of Verrio or Laguerre ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 51 ]</span>On gilded clouds in fair expansion lie , And bring all Paradise before your eye . To rest , the cushion and soft dean invite , Who never mentions hell<span type="note_anchor">[ 51 ]</span>to ears polite . 150 But hark ! the chiming clocks to dinner call ; A hundred footsteps scrape the marble hall : The rich buffet well-colour 'd serpents grace , And gaping Tritons spew to wash your face . Is this a dinner ? this a genial room ? No , ‘ tis a temple , and a hecatomb . A solemn sacrifice , perform 'd in state , You drink by measure , and to minutes eat . So quick retires each flying course , you 'd swear Sancho 's dread doctor<span type="note_anchor">[ 53 ]</span>and his wand were there . 160 Between each act the trembling salvers ring , From soup to sweet-vine , and God bless the king . In plenty starving , tantalised in state , And complaisantly help 'd to all I hate , Treated , caress 'd , and tired , I take my leave , Sick of his civil pride from morn to eve ; I curse such lavish cost , and little skill , And swear no day was ever pass 'd so ill . Yet hence the poor are clothed , the hungry fed ; Health to himself , and to his infants bread 170 The labourer bears : what his hard heart denies , His charitable vanity supplies . Another age shall see the golden ear Imbrown the slope , and nod on the parterre , Deep harvests bury all his pride has plann 'd , And laughing Ceres reassume the land . Who then shall grace , or who improve the soil ?— Who plants like Bathurst , or who builds like Boyle . ‘ Tis use alone that sanctifies expense , And splendour borrows all her rays from sense . 180 His father 's acres who enjoys in peace , Or makes his neighbours glad , if he increase : Whose cheerful tenants bless their yearly toil , Yet to their lord owe more than to the soil ; Whose ample lawns are not ashamed to feed The milky heifer and deserving steed ; Whose rising forests , not for pride or show , But future buildings , future navies , grow : Let his plantations stretch from down to down , First shade a country , and then raise a town . 190 You , too , proceed ! make falling arts your care , Erect new wonders , and the old repair ; Jones and Palladio to themselves restore , And be whate'er Vitruvius was before : Till kings call forth the ideas of your mind , ( Proud to accomplish what such hands design 'd . ) Bid harbours open , public ways extend , Bid temples , worthier of the god , ascend ; Bid the broad arch the dangerous flood contain , The mole projected break the roaring main ; 200 Back to his bonds their subject sea command , And roll obedient rivers through the land ; These honours , peace to happy Britain brings , These are imperial works , and worthy kings . VARIATION . After VER . 22 in the MS .— Must bishops , lawyers , statesmen have the skill To build , to plant , judge paintings , what you will ? Then why not Kent as well our treaties draw , Bridginan explain the gospel , Gibs the law ? EPISTLE V. TO MR ADDISON .</titlePart></docTitle>

      <head>FROM THE FIFTEENTH OF OVID 'S EPISTLES .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Say , lovely youth , that dost my heart command ,</l>
       <l n="2">Can Phaon 's eyes forget his Sappho 's hand ?</l>
       <l n="3">Must then her name the wretched writer prove ,</l>
       <l n="4">To thy remembrance lost , as to thy love ?</l>
       <l n="5">Ask not the cause that I new numbers choose ,</l>
       <l n="6">The lute neglected and the lyric Muse ;</l>
       <l n="7">Love taught my tears in sadder notes to flow ,</l>
       <l n="8">And tuned my heart to elegies of woe ,</l>
       <l n="9">I burn , I burn , as when through ripen 'd corn</l>
       <l n="10">By driving winds the spreading flames are borne ! 10</l>
       <l n="11">Phaon to Ætna 's scorching fields retires ,</l>
       <l n="12">While I consume with more than Ætna 's fires !</l>
       <l n="13">No more my soul a charm in music finds ;</l>
       <l n="14">Music has charms alone for peaceful minds .</l>
       <l n="15">Soft scenes of solitude no more can please ;</l>
       <l n="16">Love enters there , and I 'm my own disease .</l>
       <l n="17">No more the Lesbian dames my passion move ,</l>
       <l n="18">Once the dear objects of my guilty love ;</l>
       <l n="19">All other loves are lost in only thine ,</l>
       <l n="20">Ah , youth ungrateful to a flame like mine ! 20</l>
       <l n="21">Whom would not all those blooming charms surprise ,</l>
       <l n="22">Those heavenly looks , and dear deluding eyes !</l>
       <l n="23">The harp and bow would you like Phoebus bear ,</l>
       <l n="24">A brighter Phoebus Phaon might appear ;</l>
       <l n="25">Would you with ivy wreath your flowing hair ,</l>
       <l n="26">Not Bacchus ’ self with Phaon could compare :</l>
       <l n="27">Yet Phoebus loved , and Bacchus felt the flame ,</l>
       <l n="28">One Daphne warm 'd , and one the Cretan dame ;</l>
       <l n="29">Nymphs that in verse no more could rival me ,</l>
       <l n="30">Than e'en those gods contend in charms with thee . 30</l>
       <l n="31">The Muses teach me all their softest lays ,</l>
       <l n="32">And the wide world resounds with Sappho 's praise .</l>
       <l n="33">Though great Alcaeus more sublimely sings ,</l>
       <l n="34">And strikes with bolder rage the sounding strings ,</l>
       <l n="35">No less renown attends the moving lyre ,</l>
       <l n="36">Which Venus tunes , and all her loves inspire .</l>
       <l n="37">To me what nature has in charms denied ,</l>
       <l n="38">Is well by wit 's more lasting flames supplied .</l>
       <l n="39">Though short my stature , yet my name extends</l>
       <l n="40">To heaven itself , and earth 's remotest ends . 40</l>
       <l n="41">Brown as I am , an Ethiopian dame</l>
       <l n="42">Inspired young Perseus with a generous flame ;</l>
       <l n="43">Turtles and doves of different hues unite ,</l>
       <l n="44">And glossy jet is pair 'd with shining white .</l>
       <l n="45">If to no charms thou wilt thy heart resign ,</l>
       <l n="46">But such as merit , such as equal thine ,</l>
       <l n="47">By none , alas ! by none thou canst be moved ,</l>
       <l n="48">Phaon alone by Phaon must be loved !</l>
       <l n="49">Yet once thy Sappho could thy cares employ ,</l>
       <l n="50">Once in her arms you centred all your joy : 50</l>
       <l n="51">No time the dear remembrance can remove ,</l>
       <l n="52">For , oh ! how vast a memory has love !</l>
       <l n="53">My music , then , you could for ever hear ,</l>
       <l n="54">And all my words were music to your ear .</l>
       <l n="55">You stopp 'd with kisses my enchanting tongue ,</l>
       <l n="56">And found my kisses sweeter than my song ,</l>
       <l n="57">In all I pleased , but most in what was best ;</l>
       <l n="58">And the last joy was dearer than the rest .</l>
       <l n="59">Then with each word , each glance , each motion fired ,</l>
       <l n="60">You still enjoy 'd , and yet you still desired , 60</l>
       <l n="61">Till , all dissolving , in the trance we lay ,</l>
       <l n="62">And in tumultuous raptures died away .</l>
       <l n="63">The fair Sicilians now thy soul inflame ;</l>
       <l n="64">Why was I born , ye gods , a Lesbian dame ?</l>
       <l n="65">But ah , beware , Sicilian nymphs ! nor boast</l>
       <l n="66">That wandering heart which I so lately lost ;</l>
       <l n="67">Nor be with all those tempting words abused ,</l>
       <l n="68">Those tempting words were all to Sappho used .</l>
       <l n="69">And you that rule Sicilia 's happy plains ,</l>
       <l n="70">Have pity , Venus , on your poet 's pains ! 70</l>
       <l n="71">Shall fortune still in one sad tenor run ,</l>
       <l n="72">And still increase the woes so soon begun ?</l>
       <l n="73">Inured to sorrow from my tender years ,</l>
       <l n="74">My parents ’ ashes drank my early tears :</l>
       <l n="75">My brother next , neglecting wealth and fame ,</l>
       <l n="76">Ignobly burn 'd in a destructive flame :</l>
       <l n="77">An infant daughter late my griefs increased ,</l>
       <l n="78">And all a mother 's cares distract my breast ,</l>
       <l n="79">Alas ! what more could Fate itself impose ,</l>
       <l n="80">But thee , the last , and greatest of my woes ? 80</l>
       <l n="81">No more my robes in waving purple flow ,</l>
       <l n="82">Nor on my hand the sparkling diamonds glow ;</l>
       <l n="83">No more my locks in ringlets curl 'd diffuse</l>
       <l n="84">The costly sweetness of Arabian dews ,</l>
       <l n="85">Nor braids of gold the varied tresses bind ,</l>
       <l n="86">That fly disorder 'd with the wanton wind :</l>
       <l n="87">For whom should Sappho use such arts as these ?</l>
       <l n="88">He 's gone , whom only she desired to please !</l>
       <l n="89">Cupid 's light darts my tender bosom move ;</l>
       <l n="90">Still is there cause for Sappho still to love : 90</l>
       <l n="91">So from my birth the Sisters fix 'd my doom ,</l>
       <l n="92">And gave to Venus all my life to come ;</l>
       <l n="93">Or , while my Muse in melting notes complains ,</l>
       <l n="94">My yielding heart keeps measure to my strains .</l>
       <l n="95">By charms like thine , which all my soul have won ,</l>
       <l n="96">Who might not — ah ! who would not be undone ?</l>
       <l n="97">For those Aurora Cephalus might scorn ,</l>
       <l n="98">And with fresh blushes paint the conscious morn .</l>
       <l n="99">For those might Cynthia lengthen Phaon 's sleep ;</l>
       <l n="100">And bid Endymion nightly tend his sheep ; 100</l>
       <l n="101">Venus for those had rapt thee to the skies ;</l>
       <l n="102">But Mars on thee might look with Venus ’ eyes .</l>
       <l n="103">Oh scarce a youth , yet scarce a tender boy !</l>
       <l n="104">Oh useful time for lovers to employ !</l>
       <l n="105">Pride of thy age , and glory of thy race ,</l>
       <l n="106">Come to these arms , and melt in this embrace !</l>
       <l n="107">The vows you never will return , receive ;</l>
       <l n="108">And take , at least , the love you will not give .</l>
       <l n="109">See , while I write , my words are lost in tears !</l>
       <l n="110">The less my sense , the more my love appears . 110</l>
       <l n="111">Sure ‘ twas not much to bid one kind adieu ,</l>
       <l n="112">( At least to feign was never hard to you )</l>
       <l n="113">‘ Farewell , my Lesbian love , ’ you might have said ;</l>
       <l n="114">Or coldly thus , ‘ Farewell , O Lesbian maid ! ’</l>
       <l n="115">No tear did you , no parting kiss receive ,</l>
       <l n="116">Nor knew I then how much I was to grieve .</l>
       <l n="117">No lover 's gift your Sappho could confer ,</l>
       <l n="118">And wrongs and woes were all you left with her .</l>
       <l n="119">No charge I gave you , and no charge could give ,</l>
       <l n="120">But this , ‘ Be mindful of our loves , and live . ’ 120</l>
       <l n="121">Now by the Nine , those powers adored by me ,</l>
       <l n="122">And Love , the god that ever waits on thee ,</l>
       <l n="123">When first I heard ( from whom I hardly knew )</l>
       <l n="124">That you were fled , and all my joys with you ,</l>
       <l n="125">Like some sad statue , speechless , pale , I stood ,</l>
       <l n="126">Grief chill 'd my breast , and stopp 'd my freezing blood ;</l>
       <l n="127">No sigh to rise , no tear had power to flow ,</l>
       <l n="128">Fix 'd in a stupid lethargy of woe :</l>
       <l n="129">But when its way the impetuous passion found ,</l>
       <l n="130">I rend my tresses , and my breast I wound : 130</l>
       <l n="131">I rave , then weep ; I curse , and then complain ;</l>
       <l n="132">Now swell to rage , now melt in tears again .</l>
       <l n="133">Not fiercer pangs distract the mournful dame ,</l>
       <l n="134">Whose first-born infant feeds the funeral flame .</l>
       <l n="135">My scornful brother with a smile appears ,</l>
       <l n="136">Insults my woes , and triumphs in my tears ;</l>
       <l n="137">His hated image ever haunts my eyes ;</l>
       <l n="138">‘ And why this grief ? thy daughter lives ! ’ he cries .</l>
       <l n="139">Stung with my love , and furious with despair ,</l>
       <l n="140">All torn my garments , and my bosom bare , 140</l>
       <l n="141">My woes , thy crimes , I to the world proclaim ;</l>
       <l n="142">Such inconsistent things are love and shame !</l>
       <l n="143">‘ Tis thou art all my care and my delight ,</l>
       <l n="144">My daily longing , and my dream by night ;</l>
       <l n="145">Oh night more pleasing than the brightest day ,</l>
       <l n="146">When fancy gives what absence takes away ,</l>
       <l n="147">And , dress 'd in all its visionary charms ,</l>
       <l n="148">Restores my fair deserter to my arms !</l>
       <l n="149">Then round your neck in wanton wreaths I twine ,</l>
       <l n="150">Then you , methinks , as fondly circle mine : 150</l>
       <l n="151">A thousand tender words I hear and speak ;</l>
       <l n="152">A thousand melting kisses give and take :</l>
       <l n="153">Then fiercer joys , I blush to mention these ,</l>
       <l n="154">Yet , while I blush , confess how much they please .</l>
       <l n="155">But when , with day , the sweet delusions fly ,</l>
       <l n="156">And all things wake to life and joy but I ,</l>
       <l n="157">As if once more forsaken , I complain ,</l>
       <l n="158">And close my eyes to dream of you again :</l>
       <l n="159">Then frantic rise , and like some Fury rove</l>
       <l n="160">Through lonely plains , and through the silent grove ; 160</l>
       <l n="161">As if the silent grove , and lonely plains ,</l>
       <l n="162">That knew my pleasures , could relieve my pains .</l>
       <l n="163">I view the grotto , once the scene of love ,</l>
       <l n="164">The rocks around , the hanging roofs above ,</l>
       <l n="165">That charm 'd me more , with native moss o'ergrown ,</l>
       <l n="166">Than Phrygian marble , or the Parian stone ;</l>
       <l n="167">I find the shades that veil 'd our joys before ;</l>
       <l n="168">But , Phaon gone , those shades delight no more .</l>
       <l n="169">Here the press 'd herbs with bending tops betray</l>
       <l n="170">Where oft entwined in amorous folds we lay ; 170</l>
       <l n="171">I kiss that earth which once was press 'd by you ,</l>
       <l n="172">And all with tears the withering herbs bedew .</l>
       <l n="173">For thee the fading trees appear to mourn ,</l>
       <l n="174">And birds defer their songs till thy return :</l>
       <l n="175">Night shades the groves , and all in silence lie ,</l>
       <l n="176">All but the mournful Philomel and I :</l>
       <l n="177">With mournful Philomel I join my strain ,</l>
       <l n="178">Of Tereus she , of Phaon I complain .</l>

      <head>THE FIRST BOOK OF STATIUS 'S THEBAIS .</head>
      <head>TRANSLATED IN THE YEAR 1703 .</head>
      <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
      <head>Oedipus , King of Thebes , having , by mistake , slain his father Laius , and married his mother Jocasta , put out his own eyes , and resigned his realm to his sons Eteocles and Polynices . Being neglected by them , he makes his prayer to the fury Tisiphone , to sow debate betwixt the brothers . They agree at last to reign singly , each a year by turns , and the first lot is obtained by Eteocles . Jupiter , in a council of the gods , declares his resolution of punishing the Thebans , and Argives also , by means of a marriage betwixt Polynices and one of the daughters of Adrastus , King of Argos . Juno opposes , but to no effect ; and Mercury is sent on a message to the shades , to the ghost of Laius , who is to appear to Eteocles , and provoke him to break the agreement . Polynices , in the meantime , departs from Thebes by night , is overtaken by a storm , and arrives at Argos , where he meets with Tydeus , who had fled from Calydon , having killed his brother . Adrastus entertains them , having received an oracle from Apollo that his daughters should be married to a boar and a lion , which he understands to be meant by these strangers , by whom the hides of those beasts were worn , and who arrived at the time when he kept an annual feast in honour of that god . The rise of this solemnity , he relates to his guests ; the loves of Phoebus and Psamathe , and the story of Choroebus . He inquires , and is made acquainted with their descent and quality . The sacrifice is renewed , and the book concludes with a hymn to Apollo .— P .</head>

       <l n="1">There lived in Lombardy , as authors write ,</l>
       <l n="2">In days of old , a wise and worthy knight ;</l>
       <l n="3">Of gentle manners , as of generous race ,</l>
       <l n="4">Bless 'd with much sense , more riches , and some grace :</l>
       <l n="5">Yet , led astray by Venus ’ soft delights ,</l>
       <l n="6">He scarce could rule some idle appetites :</l>
       <l n="7">For long ago , let priests say what they could ,</l>
       <l n="8">Weak sinful laymen were but flesh and blood .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">But in due time , when sixty years were o'er ,</l>
       <l n="10">He vow 'd to lead this vicious life no more ; 10</l>
       <l n="11">Whether pure holiness inspired his mind ,</l>
       <l n="12">Or dotage turn 'd his brain , is hard to find ;</l>
       <l n="13">But his high courage prick 'd him forth to wed ,</l>
       <l n="14">And try the pleasures of a lawful bed .</l>
       <l n="15">This was his nightly dream , his daily care ,</l>
       <l n="16">And to the heavenly powers his constant prayer ,</l>
       <l n="17">Once , ere he died , to taste the blissful life</l>

       <l n="21">Grave authors say , and witty poets sing ,</l>
       <l n="22">That honest wedlock is a glorious thing :</l>
       <l n="23">But depth of judgment most in him appears</l>
       <l n="24">Who wisely weds in his maturer years .</l>
       <l n="25">Then let him choose a damsel young and fair ,</l>
       <l n="26">To bless his age , and bring a worthy heir ;</l>
       <l n="27">To soothe his cares , and , free from noise and strife ,</l>

       <l n="29">Let sinful bachelors their woes deplore ,</l>
       <l n="30">Full well they merit all they feel , and more : 30</l>

       <l n="37">The married man may bear his yoke with ease ,</l>
       <l n="38">Secure at once himself and Heaven to please ;</l>

       <l n="40">In bliss all night , and innocence all day : 40</l>
       <l n="41">Though fortune change , his constant spouse remains ,</l>
       <l n="42">Augments his joys , or mitigates his pains .</l>

      <docImprint>TO A PLAY FOR MR DENNIS 'S BENEFIT , IN<date>1733</date>, WHEN HE WAS OLD , BLIND , AND IN GREAT DISTRESS , A LITTLE BEFORE HIS DEATH . As when that hero , who , in each campaign , Had braved the Goth , and many a Vandal slain , Lay fortune-struck , a spectacle of woe ! Wept by each friend , forgiven by every foe : Was there a generous , a reflecting mind , But pitied Belisarius , old and blind ? Was there a chief but melted at the sight ? A common soldier , but who clubb 'd his mite ? Such , such emotions should in Britons rise , When press 'd by want and weakness Dennis lies ; 10 Dennis , who long had warr 'd with modern Huns , Their quibbles routed , and defied their puns ; A desperate bulwark , sturdy , firm , and fierce , Against the Gothic sons of frozen verse : How changed from him who made the boxes groan , And shook the stage with thunders all his own ! Stood up to dash each vain pretender 's hope , Maul the French tyrant , or pull down the Pope ! If there 's a Briton then , true bred and born , Who holds dragoons and wooden shoes in scorn ; 20 If there 's a critic of distinguished rage ; If there 's a senior who contemns this age : Let him to night his just assistance lend , And be the critic 's , Briton 's , old man 's friend .</docImprint>

       <l n="5">For this the tragic Muse first trod the stage ,</l>
       <l n="6">Commanding tears to stream through every age ;</l>
       <l n="7">Tyrants no more their savage nature kept ,</l>
       <l n="8">And foes to virtue wonder 'd how they wept .</l>
       <l n="9">Our author shuns by vulgar springs to move</l>
       <l n="10">The hero 's glory , or the virgin 's love ; 10</l>
       <l n="11">In pitying love , we but our weakness show ,</l>
       <l n="12">And wild ambition well deserves its woe .</l>
       <l n="13">Here tears shall flow from a more generous cause ,</l>
       <l n="14">Such tears as patriots shed for dying laws :</l>
       <l n="15">He bids your breasts with ancient ardour rise ,</l>
       <l n="16">And calls forth Roman drops from British eyes .</l>
       <l n="17">Virtue confess 'd in human shape he draws ,</l>
       <l n="18">What Plato thought , and godlike Cato was :</l>
       <l n="19">No common object to your sight displays ,</l>
       <l n="20">But what with pleasure Heaven itself surveys , 20</l>
       <l n="21">A brave man struggling in the storms of fate ,</l>
       <l n="22">And greatly falling with a falling state .</l>
       <l n="23">While Cato gives his little senate laws ,</l>
       <l n="24">What bosom beats not in his country 's cause ?</l>
       <l n="25">Who sees him act , but envies every deed ?</l>
       <l n="26">Who hears him groan , and does not wish to bleed ?</l>
       <l n="27">E'en when proud Caesar , ‘ midst triumphal cars ,</l>
       <l n="28">The spoils of nations , and the pomp of wars ,</l>
       <l n="29">Ignobly vain , and impotently great ,</l>
       <l n="30">Show 'd Rome her Cato 's figure drawn in state ; 30</l>
       <l n="31">As her dead father 's reverend image pass 'd ,</l>
       <l n="32">The pomp was darkened , and the day o'ercast ;</l>
       <l n="33">The triumph ceased , tears gush 'd from every eye ;</l>
       <l n="34">The world 's great victor pass 'd unheeded by ;</l>
       <l n="35">Her last good man dejected Rome adored ,</l>
       <l n="36">And honour 'd Caesar 's less than Cato 's sword .</l>

       <l n="39">With honest scorn the first famed Cato view 'd</l>
       <l n="40">Rome learning arts from Greece , whom she subdued : 40</l>
       <l n="41">Your scene precariously subsists too long</l>
       <l n="42">On French translation and Italian song .</l>
       <l n="43">Dare to have sense yourselves ; assert the stage ,</l>
       <l n="44">Be justly warm 'd with your own native rage :</l>
       <l n="45">Such plays alone should win a British ear ,</l>

       <l n="5">She furl 'd her sampler , and haul 'd in her thread ,</l>

    <body>
     <p>It is with pleasure I hear that you have procured a correct copy of ‘ The Dunciad , ’ which the many surreptitious ones have rendered so necessary ; and it is yet with more , that I am informed it will be attended with a commentary ; a work so requisite , that I cannot think the author himself would have omitted it , had he approved of the first appearance of this poem .</p>
     <p>Such notes as have occurred to me I herewith send you : you will oblige me by inserting them amongst those which are , or will be , transmitted to you by others ; since not only the author 's friends but even strangers appear engaged by humanity , to take some care of an orphan of so much genius and spirit , which its parent seems to have abandoned from the very beginning , and suffered to step into the world naked , unguarded , and unattended .</p>
     <p>It was upon reading some of the abusive papers lately published , that my great regard to a person , whose friendship I esteem as one of the chief honours of my life , and a much greater respect to truth , than to him or any man living , engaged me in inquiries , of which the enclosed notes are the fruit .</p>
     <p>I perceived that most of these authors had been ( doubtless very wisely ) the first aggressors . They had tried till they were weary , what was to be got by railing at each other ; nobody was either concerned or surprised , if this or that scribbler was proved a dunce . But every one was curious to read what could be said to prove Mr Pope one , and was ready to pay something for such a discovery ; a stratagem which , would they fairly own it , might not only reconcile them to me , but screen them from the resentment of their lawful superiors , whom they daily abuse , only ( as I charitably hope ) to get that by them , which they cannot get from them .</p>
     <p>I found this was not all . Ill success in that had transported them to personal abuse , either of himself , or ( what I think he could less forgive ) of his friends . They had called men of virtue and honour bad men , long before he had either leisure or inclination to call them bad writers ; and some had been such old offenders , that he had quite forgotten their persons as well as their slanders , till they were pleased to revive them .</p>
     <p>Now what had Mr Pope done before to incense them ? He had published those works which are in the hands of everybody , in which not the least mention is made of any of them . And what has he done since ? He has laughed , and written ‘ The Dunciad . ’ What has that said of them ? A very serious truth , which the public had said before , that they were dull ; and what it had no sooner said , but they themselves were at great pains to procure , or even purchase , room in the prints to testify under their hands to the truth of it .</p>
     <p>I should still have been silent , if either I had seen any inclination in my friend to be serious with such accusers , or if they had only meddled with his writings ; since whoever publishes , puts himself on his trial by his country . But when his moral character was attacked , and in a manner from which neither truth nor virtue can secure the most innocent ; in a manner which , though it annihilates the credit of the accusation with the just and impartial , yet aggravates very much the guilt of the accusers ; I mean by authors without names ; then I thought , since the danger was common to all , the concern ought to be so ; and that it was an act of justice to detect the authors , not only on this account , but as many of them are the same who , for several years past , have made free with the greatest names in Church and State , exposed to the world the private misfortunes of families , abused all , even to women , and whose prostituted papers ( for one or other party , in the unhappy divisions of their country ) have insulted the fallen , the friendless , the exiled , and the dead .</p>
     <p>Besides this , which I take to be a public concern , I have already confessed I had a private one . I am one of that number who have long loved and esteemed Mr Pope ; and had often declared it was not his capacity or writings ( which we ever thought the least valuable part of his character ) , but the honest , open , and beneficent man , that we most esteemed , and loved in him . Now if what these people say were believed , I must appear to all my friends either a fool , or a knave ; either imposed on myself , or imposing on them ; so that I am as much interested in the confutation of these calumnies as he is himself .</p>
     <p>I am no author , and consequently not to be suspected either of jealousy or resentment against any of the men , of whom scarce one is known to me by sight ; and as for their writings , I have sought them ( on this one occasion ) in vain , in the closets and libraries of all my acquaintance . I had still been in the dark if a gentleman had not procured me ( I suppose from some of themselves , for they are generally much more dangerous friends than enemies ) the passages I send you . I solemnly protest I have added nothing to the malice or absurdity of them ; which it behoves me to declare , since the vouchers themselves will be so soon and so irrecoverably lost . You may in some measure prevent it , by preserving at least their titles , and discovering ( as far as you can depend on the truth of your information ) the names of the concealed authors .</p>
     <p>The first objection I have heard made to the poem is , that the persons are too obscure for satire . The persons themselves , rather than allow the objection , would forgive the satire ; and if one could be tempted to afford it a serious answer , were not all assassinates , popular insurrections , the insolence of the rabble without doors , and of domestics within , most wrongfully chastised , if the meanness of offenders indemnified them from punishment ? On the contrary , obscurity renders them more dangerous , as less thought of : law can pronounce judgment only on open facts ; morality alone can pass censure on intentions of mischief ; so that for secret calumny , or the arrow flying in the dark , there is no public punishment left , but what a good writer inflicts .</p>
     <p>The next objection is , that these sort of authors are poor . That might be pleaded as an excuse at the Old Bailey for lesser crimes than defamation ( for ‘ tis the case of almost all who are tried there ) , but sure it can be none : for who will pretend that the robbing another of his reputation supplies the want of it in himself ? I question not but such authors are poor , and heartily wish the objection were removed by any honest livelihood . But poverty is here the accident , not the subject : he who describes malice and villany to be pale and meagre , expresses not the least anger against paleness or leanness , but against malice and villany . The apothecary in Romeo and Juliet is poor ; but is he therefore justified in vending poison ? Not but poverty itself becomes a just subject of satire , when it is the consequence of vice , prodigality , or neglect of one 's lawful calling ; for then it increases the public burden , fills the streets and highways with robbers , and the garrets with clippers , coiners , and weekly journalists .</p>
     <p>But admitting that two or three of these offend less in their morals than in their writings , must poverty make nonsense sacred ? If so , the fame of bad authors would be much better consulted than that of all the good ones in the world ; and not one of a hundred had ever been called by his right name .</p>
     <p>They mistake the whole matter : it is not charity to encourage them in the way they follow , but to get them out of it ; for men are not bunglers because they are poor , but they are poor because they are bunglers .</p>
     <p>Is it not pleasant enough to hear our authors crying out on the one hand , as if their persons and characters were too sacred for satire ; and the public objecting on the other , that they are too mean even for ridicule ? But whether bread or fame be their end , it must be allowed , our author , by and in this poem , has mercifully given them a little of both .</p>
     <p>There are two or three who , by their rank and fortune , have no benefit from the former objections , supposing them good ; and these I was sorry to see in such company . But if , without any provocation , two or three gentlemen will fall upon one , in an affair wherein his interest and reputation are equally embarked , they cannot , certainly , after they have been content to print themselves his enemies , complain of being put into the number of them .</p>
     <p>Others , I am told , pretend to have been once his friends . Surely they are their enemies who say so , since nothing can be more odious than to treat a friend as they have done . But of this I cannot persuade myself , when I consider the constant and eternal aversion of all bad writers to a good one .</p>
     <p>Such as claim a merit from being his admirers , I would gladly ask , if it lays him under a personal obligation ? At that rate , he would be the most obliged humble servant in the world . I dare swear for these in particular , he never desired them to be his admirers , nor promised in return to be theirs : that had truly been a sign he was of their acquaintance ; but would not the malicious world have suspected such an approbation of some motive worse than ignorance in the author of the Essay on Criticism ? Be it as it will , the reasons of their admiration and of his contempt are equally subsisting , for his works and theirs are the very same that they were .</p>
     <p>One , therefore , of their assertions I believe may be true — ‘ That he has a contempt for their writings . ’ And there is another , which would probably be sooner allowed by himself than by any good judge beside — ‘ That his own have found too much success with the public . ’ But as it cannot consist with his modesty to claim this as justice , it lies not on him , but entirely on the public , to defend its own judgment .</p>
     <p>There remains what in my opinion might seem a better plea for these people than any they have made use of . If obscurity or poverty were to exempt a man from satire , much more should folly or dulness , which are still more involuntary ; nay , as much so as personal deformity . But even this will not help them : deformity becomes an object of ridicule when a man sets up for being handsome ; and so must dulness when he sets up for a wit . They are not ridiculed because ridicule in itself is , or ought to be , a pleasure , but because it is just to undeceive and vindicate the honest and unpretending part of mankind from imposition , because particular interest ought to yield to general , and a great number who are not naturally fools ought never to be made so , in complaisance to a few who are . Accordingly we find that in all ages , all vain pretenders , were they ever so poor or ever so dull , have been constantly the topics of the most candid satirists , from the Codrus of Juvenal to the Damon of Boileau .</p>
     <p>Having mentioned Boileau , the greatest poet and most judicious critic of his age and country , admirable for his talents , and yet perhaps more admirable for his judgment in the proper application of them , I cannot help remarking the resemblance betwixt him and our author , in qualities , fame , and fortune , in the distinctions shown them by their superiors , in the general esteem of their equals , and in their extended reputation amongst foreigners ; in the latter of which ours has met with the better fate , as he has had for his translators persons of the most eminent rank and abilities in their respective nations . But the resemblance holds in nothing more than in their being equally abused by the ignorant pretenders to poetry of their times , of which not the least memory will remain but in their own writings , and in the notes made upon them . What Boileau has done in almost all his poems , our author has only in this : I dare answer for him he will do it in no more ; and on this principle , of attacking few but who had slandered him , he could not have done it at all , had he been confined from censuring obscure and worthless persons , for scarce any other were his enemies . However , as the parity is so remarkable , I hope it will continue to the last ; and if ever he shall give us an edition of this poem himself , I may see some of them treated as gently , on their repentance or better merit , as Perrault and Quinault were at last by Boileau .</p>
     <p>In one point I must be allowed to think the character of our English poet the more amiable . He has not been a follower of fortune or success ; he has lived with the great without flattery — been a friend to men in power , without pensions , from whom , as he asked , so he received no favour but what was done him in his friends . As his satires were the more just for being delayed , so were his panegyrics ; bestowed only on such persons as he had familiarly known , only for such virtues as he had long observed in them , and only at such times as others cease to praise , if not begin to calumniate them — I mean , when out of power or out of fashion . A satire , therefore , on writers so notorious for the contrary practice , became no man so well as himself ; as none , it is plain , was so little in their friendships , or so much in that of those whom they had most abused — namely , the greatest and best of all parties . Let me add a further reason , that , though engaged in their friendships , he never espoused their animosities ; and can almost singly challenge this honour , not to have written a line of any man , which , through guilt , through shame , or through fear , through variety of fortune , or change of interests , he was ever unwilling to own .</p>
     <p>I shall conclude with remarking , what a pleasure it must be to every reader of humanity to see all along , that our author in his very laughter is not indulging his own ill-nature , but only punishing that of others . As to his poem , those alone are capable of doing it justice , who , to use the words of a great writer , know how hard it is ( with regard both to his subject and his manner ) vetustis dare novitatem , obsoletis nitorem , obscuris lucem , fastiditis gratiam .— I am</p>

     <p>DENNIS , REMARKS ON PR . ARTHUR .</p>
     <p>I cannot but think it the most reasonable thing in the world to distinguish good writers , by discouraging the bad . Nor is it an ill-natured thing , in relation even to the very persons upon whom the reflections are made . It is true , it may deprive them , a little the sooner , of a short profit and a transitory reputation ; but then it may have a good effect , and oblige them ( before it be too late ) to decline that for which they are so very unfit , and to have recourse to something in which they may be more successful .</p>
     <p>CHARACTER OF MR P ., 1716 .</p>
     <p>The persons whom Boileau has attacked in his writings have been for the most part authors , and most of those authors , poets : and the censures he hath passed upon them have been confirmed by all Europe .</p>
     <p>GILDON , PREF . TO HIS NEW REHEARSAL .</p>
     <p>It is the common cry of the poetasters of the town , and their fautors , that it is an ill-natured thing to expose the pretenders to wit and poetry . The judges and magistrates may , with full as good reason , be reproached with ill-nature for putting the laws in execution against a thief or impostor . The same will hold in the republic of letters , if the critics and judges will let every ignorant pretender to scribbling pass on the world .</p>

     <head>TESTIMONIES OF AUTHORS</head>
     <head>CONCERNING OUR POET AND HIS WORKS .</head>
     <head>M. SCRIBLERUS LECTORI S .</head>
     <p>Before we present thee with our exercitations on this most delectable poem ( drawn from the many volumes of our Adversaria on modern authors ) we shall here , according to the laudable usage of editors , collect the various judgments of the learned concerning our Poet : various indeed , not only of different authors , but of the same author at different seasons . Nor shall we gather only the testimonies of such eminent wits as would of course descend to posterity , and consequently be read without our collection ; but we shall likewise , with incredible labour , seek out for divers others , which , but for this our diligence , could never , at the distance of a few months , appear to the eye of the most curious . Hereby thou may'st not only receive the delectation of variety , but also arrive at a more certain judgment , by a grave and circumspect comparison of the witnesses with each other , or of each with himself . Hence also , thou wilt be enabled to draw reflections , not only of a critical , but a moral nature , by being let into many particulars of the person as well as genius , and of the fortune as well as merit , of our author : in which , if I relate some things of little concern peradventure to thee , and some of as little even to him , I entreat thee to consider how minutely all true critics and commentators are wont to insist upon such , and how material they seem to themselves , if to none other . Forgive me , gentle reader , if ( following learned example ) I ever and anon become tedious : allow me to take the same pains to find whether my author were good or bad , well or ill-natured , modest or arrogant ; as another , whether his author was fair or brown , short or tall , or whether he wore a coat or a cassock .</p>
     <p>We purposed to begin with his life , parentage , and education : but as to these , even his cotemporaries do exceedingly differ . One saith ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 134 ]</span>he was educated at home ; another ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 135 ]</span>that he was bred at St Omer 's by Jesuits ; a third ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 136 ]</span>not at St Omer 's , but at Oxford ; a fourth ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 137 ]</span>that he had no University education at all . Those who allow him to be bred at home differ as much concerning his tutor : one saith ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 138 ]</span>he was kept by his father on purpose ; a second ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 139 ]</span>that he was an itinerant priest ; a third ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 140 ]</span>that he was a parson ; one<span type="note_anchor">[ 141 ]</span>calleth him a secular clergyman of the Church of Rome ; another ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 142 ]</span>a monk . As little do they agree about his father , whom one<span type="note_anchor">[ 143 ]</span>supposeth , like the father of Hesiod , a tradesman or merchant ; another ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 144 ]</span>a husbandman ; another ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 145 ]</span>a hatter , &amp; c. Nor has an author been wanting to give our Poet such a father as Apuleius hath to Plato , Jamblichus to Pythagoras , and divers to Homer , namely , a demon : For thus Mr Gildon [ 146 ]: ‘ Certain it is , that his original is not from Adam , but the Devil ; and that he wanteth nothing but horns and tail to be the exact resemblance of his infernal Father . ’ Finding , therefore , such contrariety of opinions , and ( whatever be ours of this sort of generation ) not being fond to enter into controversy , we shall defer writing the life of our Poet , till authors can determine among themselves what parents or education he had , or whether he had any education or parents at all .</p>
     <p>Proceed we to what is more certain , his Works , though not less uncertain the judgments concerning them ; beginning with his Essay on Criticism , of which hear first the most ancient of critics —</p>

      <head>‘ His precepts are false or trivial , or both ; his thoughts are crude and abortive , his expressions absurd , his numbers harsh and unmusical , his rhymes trivial and common :— instead of majesty , we have something that is very mean ; instead of gravity , something that is very boyish ; and instead of perspicuity and lucid order , we have but too often obscurity and confusion . ’ And in another place : ‘ What rare numbers are here ! Would not one swear that this youngster had espoused some antiquated Muse , who had sued out a divorce from some superannuated sinner , upon account of impotence , and who , being poxed by her former spouse , has got the gout in her decrepid age , which makes her hobble so damnably .

      <head>MR LEONARD WELSTED ,</head>
      <head>who , out of great respect to our poet not naming him , doth yet glance at his essay , together with the Duke of Buckingham 's , and the criticisms of Dryden , and of Horace , which he more openly taxeth : ‘ As to the numerous treatises , essays , arts , &amp; c ., both in verse and prose , that have been written by the moderns on this ground-work , they do but hackney the same thoughts over again , making them still more trite . Most of their pieces are nothing but a pert , insipid heap of common-place . Horace has even , in his Art of Poetry , thrown out several things which plainly shew he thought an Art of Poetry was of no use , even while he was writing one . '[ 149 ]</head>
       <l n="1">To all which great authorities , we can only oppose that of</l>
     </lg>
     <p>MR ADDISON .</p>
     <p>‘ The Art of Criticism ( saith he ) , which was published some months since , is a master-piece in its kind . The observations follow one another , like those in Horace 's Art of Poetry , without that methodical regularity which would have been requisite in a prose writer . They are some of them uncommon , but such as the reader must assent to , when he sees them explained with that ease and perspicuity in which they are delivered . As for those which are the most known and the most received , they are placed in so beautiful a light , and illustrated with such apt allusions , that they have in them all the graces of novelty , and make the reader , who was before acquainted with them , still more convinced of their truth and solidity . And here give me leave to mention what Monsieur Boileau has so well enlarged upon in the preface to his works — that wit and fine writing doth not consist so much in advancing things that are new , as in giving things that are known an agreeable turn . It is impossible for us , who live in the latter ages of the world , to make observations in criticism , morality , or any art or science , which have not been touched upon by others ; we have little else left us but to represent the common sense of mankind in more strong , more beautiful , or more uncommon lights . If a reader examines Horace 's Art of Poetry , he will find but few precepts in it which he may not meet with in Aristotle , and which were not commonly known by all the poets of the Augustan age . His way of expressing and applying them , not his invention of them , is what we are chiefly to admire . ’</p>
     <p>‘ Longinus , in his Reflections , has given us the same kind of sublime which he observes in the several passages that occasioned them : I cannot but take notice that our English author has , after the same manner , exemplified several of the precepts in the very precepts themselves . ’ He then produces some instances of a particular beauty in the numbers , and concludes with saying , ‘ that there are three poems in our tongue of the same nature , and each a master-piece in its kind — the Essay on Translated Verse , the Essay on the Art of Poetry , and the Essay on Criticism .

     <p>in the preface to his poem of Claremont , differs from this opinion : ‘ Those who have seen these two excellent poems of Cooper 's Hill and Windsor Forest — the one written by Sir John Denham , the other by Mr Pope — will shew a great deal of candour if they approve of this . ’</p>
     <p>Of the Epistle of ELOISA , we are told by the obscure writer of a poem called Sawney , ‘ That because Prior 's Henry and Emma charmed the finest tastes , our author writ his Eloise in opposition to it , but forgot innocence and virtue : if you take away her tender thoughts and her fierce desires , all the rest is of no value . ’ In which , methinks , his judgment resembleth that of a French tailor on a villa and gardens by the Thames : ‘ All this is very fine , but take away the river and it is good for nothing . ’</p>

     </lg>
     <p>MR LEWIS THEOBALD</p>
     <p>thus extols it : ‘ The spirit of Homer breathes all through this translation .— I am in doubt whether I should most admire the justness to the original , or the force and beauty of the language , or the sounding variety of the numbers : but when I find all these meet , it puts me in mind of what the poet says of one of his heroes , that he alone raised and flung with ease a weighty stone , that two common men could not lift from the ground ; just so , one single person has performed in this translation what I once despaired to have seen done by the force of several masterly hands . '[ 155 ] Indeed , the same gentleman appears to have changed his sentiment in his Essay on the Art of Sinking in Reputation ( printed in Mist 's Journal , March 30 , 1728 ,) where he says thus :— ‘ In order to sink in reputation , let him take into his head to descend into Homer ( let the world wonder , as it will , how the devil he got there ) , and pretend to do him into English , so his version denote his neglect of the manner how . ’ Strange variation ! We are told in</p>
     <p>MIST 'S JOURNAL , JUNE 8 ,</p>
     <p>‘ That this translation of the Iliad was not in all respects conformable to the fine taste of his friend , Mr Addison ; insomuch that he employed a younger Muse in an undertaking of this kind , which he supervised himself . ’ Whether Mr Addison did find it conformable to his taste or not , best appears from his own testimony the year following its publication , in these words :</p>
     <p>MR ADDISON , FREEHOLDER , NO . 40 .</p>
     <p>‘ When I consider myself as a British freeholder , I am in a particular manner pleased with the labours of those who have improved our language with the translations of old Greek and Latin authors .— We have already most of their historians in our own tongue , and what is more for the honour of our language , it has been taught to express with elegance the greatest of their poets in each nation . The illiterate among our own countrymen may learn to judge from Dryden 's Virgil of the most perfect epic performance . And those parts of Homer which have been published already by Mr Pope , give us reason to think that the Iliad will appear in English with as little disadvantage to that immortal poem . ’</p>
     <p>As to the rest , there is a slight mistake , for this younger Muse was an elder : nor was the gentleman ( who is a friend of our author ) employed by Mr Addison to translate it after him , since he saith himself that he did it before .<span type="note_anchor">[ 156 ]</span>Contrariwise that Mr Addison engaged our author in this work appeareth by declaration thereof in the preface to the Iliad , printed some time before his death , and by his own letters of October 26 , and November 2 , 1713 , where he declares it his opinion that no other person was equal to it .</p>
     <p>Next comes his Shakspeare on the stage : ‘ Let him ( quoth one , whom I take to be</p>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>MR THEOBALD , MIST 'S JOURNAL , JUNE 8 , 1728 ,)</head>
      <head>publish such an author as he has least studied , and forget to discharge even the dull duty of an editor . In this project let him lend the bookseller his name ( for a competent sum of money ) to promote the credit of an exorbitant subscription . ’ Gentle reader , be pleased to cast thine eye on the proposal below quoted , and on what follows ( some months after the former assertion ) in the same journalist of June 8 . ‘ The bookseller proposed the book by subscription , and raised some thousands of pounds for the same : I believe the gentleman did not share in the profits of this extravagant subscription .</head>
       <l n="1">‘ After the Iliad , he undertook ( saith</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>MIST 'S JOURNAL , JUNE 8 , 1728 ,)</head>
      <head>the sequel of that work , the Odyssey ; and having secured the success by a numerous subscription , he employed some underlings to perform what , according to his proposals , should come from his own hands . ’ To which heavy charge we can in truth oppose nothing but the words of</head>
       <l n="1">MR POPE 'S PROPOSAL FOR THE ODYSSEY , ( PRINTED BY J. WATTS , JAN. 10 ,</l>
       <l n="2">1724 . )</l>
     </lg>
     <p>‘ I take this occasion to declare that the subscription for Shakspeare belongs wholly to Mr Tonson : And that the benefit of this proposal is not solely for my own use , but for that of two of my friends , who have assisted me in this work . ’ But these very gentlemen are extolled above our poet himself in another of Mist 's Journals , March 30 , 1728 , saying , ‘ That he would not advise Mr Pope to try the experiment again of getting a great part of a book done by assistants , lest those extraneous parts should unhappily ascend to the sublime , and retard the declension of the whole . ’ Behold ! these underlings are become good writers !</p>
     <p>If any say , that before the said proposals were printed , the subscription was begun without declaration of such assistance , verily those who set it on foot , or ( as their term is ) secured it , to wit , the Right Honourable the Lord Viscount Harcourt , were he living , would testify , and the Right Honourable the Lord Bathurst , now living , doth testify the same is a falsehood .</p>
     <p>Sorry I am , that persons professing to be learned , or of whatever rank of authors , should either falsely tax , or be falsely taxed . Yet let us , who are only reporters , be impartial in our citations , and proceed .</p>
     <p>MIST 'S JOURNAL , JUNE 8 , 1728 .</p>
     <p>‘ Mr Addison raised this author from obscurity , obtained him the acquaintance and friendship of the whole body of our nobility , and transferred his powerful interests with those great men to this rising bard , who frequently levied by that means unusual contributions on the public . ’ Which surely cannot be , if , as the author of The Dunciad Dissected reporteth , ‘ Mr Wycherley had before introduced him into a familiar acquaintance with the greatest peers and brightest wits then living . ’</p>
     <p>‘ No sooner ( saith the same journalist ) was his body lifeless , but this author , reviving his resentment , libelled the memory of his departed friend ; and , what was still more heinous , made the scandal public . ’ Grievous the accusation ! unknown the accuser ! the person accused no witness in his own cause ; the person , in whose regard accused , dead ! But if there be living any one nobleman whose friendship , yea , any one gentleman whose subscription Mr Addison procured to our author , let him stand forth that truth may appear ! Amicus Plato , amicus Socrates , sed magis amica veritas . In verity , the whole story of the libel is a lie . Witness those persons of integrity , who , several years before Mr Addison 's decease , did see and approve of the said verses , in nowise a libel but a friendly rebuke sent privately in our author 's own hand to Mr Addison himself , and never made public , till after their own journals and Curll had printed the same . One name alone , which I am here authorised to declare , will sufficiently evince this truth , that of the Eight Honourable the Earl of Burlington .</p>
     <p>Next is he taxed with a crime ( in the opinion of some authors , I doubt , more heinous than any in morality ) to wit , plagiarism , from the inventive and quaint-conceited</p>
     <p>JAMES MOORE SMITH , GENT .</p>
     <p>‘ Upon reading the third volume of Pope 's Miscellanies , I found five lines which I thought excellent ; and happening to praise them , a gentleman produced a modern comedy ( the Rival Modes ) published last year , where were the same verses to a tittle . These gentlemen are undoubtedly the first plagiaries that pretend to make a reputation by stealing from a man 's works in his own life-time , and out of a public print . '[ 157 ] Let us join to this what is written by the author of the Rival Modes , the said Mr James Moore Smith , in a letter to our author himself , who had informed him , a month before that play was acted , Jan. 27 , 1726-7 , that ‘ these verses , which he had before given him leave to insert in it , would be known for his , some copies being got abroad . He desires , nevertheless , that since the lines had been read in his comedy to several , Mr P. would not deprive it of them , ’ &amp; c. Surely if we add the testimonies of the Lord Bolingbroke , of the lady to whom the said verses were originally addressed , of Hugh Bethel , Esq ., and others , who knew them as our author 's , long before the said gentleman composed his play , it is hoped the ingenuous that affect not error will rectify their opinion by the suffrage of so honourable personages .</p>
     <p>And yet followeth another charge , insinuating no less than his enmity both to Church and State , which could come from no other informer than the said</p>
     <p>MR JAMES MOORE SMITH .</p>
     <p>‘ The Memoirs of a Parish Clerk was a very dull and unjust abuse of a person who wrote in defence of our religion and constitution , and who has been dead many years . '[ 158 ] This seemeth also most untrue , it being known to divers that these memoirs were written at the seat of the Lord Harcourt in Oxfordshire , before that excellent person ( Bishop Burnet 's ) death , and many years before the appearance of that history of which they are pretended to be an abuse . Most true it is that Mr Moore had such a design , and was himself the man who pressed Dr Arbuthnot and Mr Pope to assist him therein ; and that he borrowed those memoirs of our author , when that history came forth , with intent to turn them to such abuse . But being able to obtain from our author but one single hint , and either changing his mind , or having more mind than ability , he contented himself to keep the said memoirs , and read them as his own to all his acquaintance . A noble person there is , into whose company Mr Pope once chanced to introduce him , who well remembereth the conversation of Mr Moore to have turned upon the ‘ contempt he had for the work of that reverend prelate , and how full he was of a design he declared himself to have of exposing it . ’ This noble person is the Earl of Peterborough .</p>
     <p>Here in truth should we crave pardon of all the foresaid right honourable and worthy personages , for having mentioned them in the same page with such weekly riff-raff railers and rhymers , but that we had their ever-honoured commands for the same ; and that they are introduced not as witnesses in the controversy , but as witnesses that cannot be controverted ; not to dispute , but to decide .</p>
     <p>Certain it is , that dividing our writers into two classes , of such who were acquaintance , and of such who were strangers to our author ; the former are those who speak well , and the other those who speak evil of him . Of the first class , the most noble</p>

      <head>who , in his ‘ Reflections on the Essay on Criticism , ’ thus describeth him , ‘ A little affected hypocrite , who has nothing in his mouth but candour , truth , friendship , good-nature , humanity , and magnanimity . He is so great a lover of falsehood , that , whenever he has a mind to calumniate his cotemporaries , he brands them with some defect which is just contrary to some good quality for which all their friends and their acquaintance commend them . He seems to have a particular pique to people of quality , and authors of that rank . He must derive his religion from St Omer 's . ’ But in the character of Mr P. and his writings ( printed by S. Popping , 1716 ) , he saith , ‘ Though he is a professor of the worst religion , yet he laughs at it ; ’ but that ‘ nevertheless he is a virulent Papist ; and yet a pillar for the Church of England . ’</head>
       <l n="1">Of both which opinions</l>
     </lg>
     <p>MR LEWIS THEOBALD</p>
     <p>seems also to be ; declaring , in Mist 's Journal of June 22 , 1718 — ‘ That , if he is not shrewdly abused , he made it his practice to cackle to both parties in their own sentiments . ’ But , as to his pique against people of quality , the same journalist doth not agree , but saith ( May 8 , 1728 ) — ‘ He had , by some means or other , the acquaintance and friendship of the whole body of our nobility . ’</p>
     <p>However contradictory this may appear , Mr Dennis and Gildon , in the character last cited , make it all plain , by assuring us , ‘ That he is a creature that reconciles all contradictions ; he is a beast , and a man ; a Whig , and a Tory ; a writer ( at one and the same time ) of Guardians and Examiners ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 164 ]</span>an assertor of liberty , and of the dispensing power of kings ; a Jesuitical professor of truth , a base and a foul pretender to candour . ’ So that , upon the whole account , we must conclude him either to have been a great hypocrite , or a very honest man ; a terrible imposer upon both parties , or very moderate to either .</p>
     <p>Be it as to the judicious reader shall seem good . Sure it is , he is little favoured of certain authors , whose wrath is perilous : for one declares he ought to have a price set on his head , and to be hunted down as a wild beast .<span type="note_anchor">[ 165 ]</span>Another protests that he does not know what may happen ; advises him to insure his person ; says he has bitter enemies , and expressly declares it will be well if he escapes with his life .<span type="note_anchor">[ 166 ]</span>One desires he would cut his own throat , or hang himself .<span type="note_anchor">[ 167 ]</span></p>
     <p>But Pasquin seemed rather inclined it should be done by the Government , representing him engaged in grievous designs with a lord of Parliament , then under prosecution .<span type="note_anchor">[ 168 ]</span>Mr Dennis himself hath written to a minister , that he is one of the most dangerous persons in this kingdom ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 169 ]</span>and assureth the public , that he is an open and mortal enemy to his country ; a monster , that will , one day , shew as daring a soul as a mad Indian , who runs a-muck to kill the first Christian he meets .<span type="note_anchor">[ 170 ]</span>Another gives information of treason discovered in his poem .<span type="note_anchor">[ 171 ]</span>Mr Curll boldly supplies an imperfect verse with kings and princesses .<span type="note_anchor">[ 172 ]</span>And one Matthew Concanen , yet more impudent , publishes at length the two most sacred names in this nation , as members of the Dunciad .<span type="note_anchor">[ 173 ]</span></p>
     <p>This is prodigious ! yet it is almost as strange , that in the midst of these invectives his greatest enemies have ( I know not how ) borne testimony to some merit in him .</p>
     <p>MR THEOBALD ,</p>
     <p>in censuring his Shakspeare , declares , ‘ He has so great an esteem for Mr Pope , and so high an opinion of his genius and excellencies , that , notwithstanding he professes a veneration almost rising to idolatry for the writings of this inimitable poet , he would be very both even to do him justice , at the expense of that other gentleman 's character . '[ 174 ]</p>
     <p>MR CHARLES GILDON ,</p>
     <p>after having violently attacked him in many pieces , at last came to wish from his heart , ‘ That Mr Pope would be prevailed upon to give us Ovid 's Epistles by his hand , for it is certain we see the original of Sappho to Pliaon with much more life and likeness in his version , than in that of Sir Car Scrope . And this , ’ he adds , ‘ is the more to be wished , because in the English tongue we have scarce anything truly and naturally written upon love . '[ 175 ] He also , in taxing Sir Richard Blackmore for his heterodox opinions of Homer , challengeth him to answer what Mr Pope hath said in his preface to that poet .</p>
     <p>MR OLDMIXON</p>
     <p>calls him a great master of our tongue ; declares ‘ the purity and perfection of the English language to be found in his Homer ; and , saying there are more good verses in Dryden 's Virgil than in any other work , excepts this of our author only . '[ 176 ]</p>
     <p>THE AUTHOR OF A LETTER TO MR CIBBER</p>
     <p>says , ‘ Pope was so good a versifier [ once ] , that , his predecessor , Mr Dryden , and his cotemporary , Mr Prior , excepted , the harmony of his numbers is equal to anybody 's . And that he had all the merit that a man can have that way . '[ 177 ] And</p>

     <p>Although he says , ‘ The smooth numbers of the Dunciad are all that recommend it , nor has it any other merit , ’ yet that same paper hath these words : ‘ The author is allowed to be a perfect master of an easy and elegant versification . In all his works we find the most happy turns and natural similes , wonderfully short and thick sown . ’</p>
     <p>The Essay on the Dunciad also owns ( p. 25 ) it is very full of beautiful images . But the panegyric which crowns all that can be said on this poem is bestowed by our laureate ,</p>

     <p>MR LEONARD WELSTED</p>
     <p>thus wrote<span type="note_anchor">[ 181 ]</span>to the unknown author , on the first publication of the said Essay :— ‘ I must own , after the reception which the vilest and most immoral ribaldry hath lately met with , I was surprised to see what I had long despaired — a performance deserving the name of a poet . Such , sir , is your work . It is , indeed , above all commendation , and ought to have been published in an age and country more worthy of it . If my testimony be of weight anywhere , you are sure to have it in the amplest manner , ’ &amp; c .</p>
     <p>Thus we see every one of his works hath been extolled by one or other of his most inveterate enemies ; and to the success of them all , they do unanimously give testimony . But it is sufficient , instar omnium , to behold the great critic , Mr Dennis , sorely lamenting it , even from the Essay on Criticism to this day of the Dunciad ! ‘ A most notorious instance , ’ quoth he , ‘ of the depravity of genius and taste , the approbation this essay meets with . '[ 182 ] ‘ I can safely affirm , that I never attacked any of these writings , unless they had success infinitely beyond their merit . This , though an empty , has been a popular scribbler . The epidemic madness of the times has given him reputation . '[ 183 ] ‘ If , after the cruel treatment so many extraordinary men ( Spencer , Lord Bacon , Ben . Jonson , Milton , Butler , Otway , and others ) have received from this country , for these last hundred years , I should shift the scene , and show all that penury changed at once to riot and profuseness , and more squandered away upon one object than would have satisfied the greater part of those extraordinary men , the reader to whom this one creature should be unknown would fancy him a prodigy of art and nature , would believe that all the great qualities of these persons were centred in him alone . But if I should venture to assure him that the people of England had made such a choice , the reader would either believe me a malicious enemy and slanderer , or that the reign of the last ( Queen Anne 's ) ministry was designed by fate to encourage fools . '[ 184 ]</p>
     <p>But it happens that this our poet never had any place , pension , or gratuity , in any shape , from the said glorious queen , or any of her ministers . All he owed , in the whole course of his life , to any court , was a subscription , for his Homer , of £ 200 from King George I ., and £ 100 from the Prince and Princess .</p>
     <p>However , lest we imagine our author 's success was constant and universal , they acquaint us of certain works in a less degree of repute , whereof , although owned by others , yet do they assure us he is the writer . Of this sort Mr Dennis<span type="note_anchor">[ 185 ]</span>ascribes to him two farces , whose names he does not tell , but assures us that there is not one jest in them ; and an imitation of Horace , whose title he does not mention , but assures us it is much more execrable than all his works .<span type="note_anchor">[ 186 ]</span>The Daily Journal , May 11 , 1728 , assures us ‘ He is below Tom D'Urfey in the drama , because ( as that writer thinks ) the Marriage-Hater Matched , and the Boarding School , are better than the What-d ’ - ye-call-it , ’ which is not Mr P .' s , but Mr Gay 's . Mr Gildon assures us , in his New Rehearsal , p. 48 , ‘ That he was writing a play of the Lady Jane Grey ; ’ but it afterwards proved to be Mr Howe 's . We are assured by another , ‘ He wrote a pamphlet called Dr Andrew Tripe ,'[ 187 ] which proved to be one Dr Wagstaff 's . Mr Theobald assures us in Mist of the 27th April , ‘ That the Treatise of the Pro-found is very dull , and that Mr Pope is the author of it . ’ The writer of Gulliveriana is of another opinion , and says , ‘ The whole , or greatest part , of the merit of this treatise must and can only be ascribed to Gulliver . '[ 188 ] ( Here , gentle reader ! cannot I but smile at the strange blindness and positiveness of men , knowing the said treatise to appertain to none other but to me , Martinus Scriblerus . ) We are assured , in Mist of June 8 , ‘ That his own plays and farces would better have adorned the Dunciad than those of Mr Theobald , for he had neither genius for tragedy nor comedy ; ’ which , whether true or not , is not easy to judge , inasmuch as he hath attempted neither — unless we will take it for granted , with Mr Cibber , that his being once very angry at hearing a friend 's play abused was an infallible proof the play was his own , the said Mr Cibber thinking it impossible for a man to be much concerned for any but himself : ‘ Now let any man judge , ’ saith he , ‘ by this concern , who was the true mother of the child ? '[ 189 ]</p>
     <p>But from all that hath been said , the discerning reader will collect , that it little availed our author to have any candour , since , when he declared he did not write for others , it was not credited ; as little to have any modesty , since , when he declined writing in any way himself , the presumption of others was imputed to him . If he singly enterprised one great work , he was taxed of boldness and madness to a prodigy ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 190 ]</span>if he took assistants in another , it was complained of , and represented as a great injury to the public .<span type="note_anchor">[ 191 ]</span>The loftiest heroics , the lowest ballads , treatises against the State or Church , satires on lords and ladies , raillery on wits and authors , squabbles with booksellers , or even full and true accounts of monsters , poisons , and murders ; of any hereof was there nothing so good , nothing so bad , which hath not at one or other season been to him ascribed . If it bore no author 's name , then lay he concealed ; if it did , he fathered it upon that author to be yet better concealed : if it resembled any of his styles , then was it evident ; if it did not , then disguised he it on set purpose . Yea , even direct oppositions in religion , principles , and politics , have equally been supposed in him inherent . Surely a most rare and singular character ! Of which , let the reader make what he can .</p>
     <p>Doubtless most commentators would hence take occasion to turn all to their author 's advantage ; and , from the testimony of his very enemies , would affirm that his capacity was boundless , as well as his imagination ; that he was a perfect master of all styles , and all arguments ; and that there was in those times no other writer , in any kind , of any degree of excellence , save he himself . But as this is not our own sentiment , we shall determine on nothing , but leave thee , gentle reader , to steer thy judgment equally between various opinions , and to choose whether thou wilt incline to the testimonies of authors avowed , or of authors concealed — of those who knew him , or of those who knew him not .</p>
     <p>P .</p>
     <p>MARTINUS SCRIBLERUS OF THE POEM .</p>
     <p>This poem , as it celebrateth the most grave and ancient of things , Chaos , Night , and Dulness ; so is it of the most grave and ancient kind . Homer ( saith Aristotle ) was the first who gave the form , and ( saith Horace ) who adapted the measure , to heroic poesy . But even before this , may be rationally presumed from what the ancients have left written , was a piece by Homer , composed of like nature and matter with this of our poet . For of epic sort it appeareth to have been , yet of matter surely not unpleasant , witness what is reported of it by the learned Archbishop Eustathius , in Odyss . x ., and accordingly Aristotle , in his Poetic , chap , iv ., does further set forth , that as the Iliad and Odyssey gave example to tragedy , so did this poem to comedy its first idea .</p>
     <p>From these authors also it should seem that the hero or chief personage of it was no less obscure , and his understanding and sentiments no less quaint and strange ( if indeed not more so ) , than any of the actors of our poem . Margites was the name of this personage , whom antiquity recordeth to have been Dunce the first ; and surely , from what we hear of him , not unworthy to be the root of so spreading a tree and so numerous a posterity . The poem therefore celebrating him was properly and absolutely a Dunciad ; which , though now unhappily lost , yet is its nature sufficiently known by the infallible tokens aforesaid . And thus it doth appear that the first Dunciad was the first epic poem , written by Homer himself , and anterior even to the Iliad or Odyssey .</p>
     <p>Now , forasmuch as our poet had translated those two famous works of Homer which are yet left , he did conceive it in some sort his duty to imitate that also which was lost ; and was therefore induced to bestow on it the same form which Homer 's is reported to have had , namely , that of epic poem ; with a title also framed after the ancient Greek manner , to wit , that of Dunciad .</p>
     <p>Wonderful it is that so few of the moderns have been stimulated to attempt some Dunciad ! since , in the opinion of the multitude , it might cost less pain and oil than an imitation of the greater epic . But possible it is also , that , on due reflection , the maker might find it easier to paint a Charlemagne , a Brute , or a Godfrey , with just pomp and dignity heroic , than a Margites , a Codrus , or a Flecknoe .</p>
     <p>We shall next declare the occasion and the cause which moved our poet to this particular work . He lived in those days , when ( after Providence had permitted the invention of printing as a scourge for the sins of the learned ) paper also became so cheap , and printers so numerous , that a deluge of authors covered the land ; whereby not only the peace of the honest unwriting subject was daily molested , but unmerciful demands were made of his applause , yea of his money , by such as would neither earn the one nor deserve the other . At the same time , the licence of the press was such , that it grew dangerous to refuse them either : for they would forthwith publish slanders unpunished , the authors being anonymous , and skulking under the wings of publishers , a set of men who never scrupled to vend either calumny or blasphemy , as long as the town would call for it .</p>
     <p>Now our author ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 192 ]</span>living in those times , did conceive it an endeavour well worthy an honest satirist to dissuade the dull and punish the wicked , the only way that was left . In that public-spirited view he laid the plan of this poem , as the greatest service he was capable ( without much hurt , or being slain ) to render his dear country . First , taking things from their original , he considereth the causes creative of such authors — namely , dulness and poverty ; the one born with them , the other contracted by neglect of their proper talents , through self-conceit of greater abilities . This truth he wrappeth in an allegory<span type="note_anchor">[ 193 ]</span>( as the construction of epic poesy requireth ) , and feigns that one of these goddesses had taken up her abode with the other , and that they jointly inspired all such writers and such works . He proceedeth to show the qualities they bestow on these authors ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 194 ]</span>and the effects they produce ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 195 ]</span>then the materials , or stock , with which they furnish them ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 196 ]</span>and ( above all ) that self-opinion<span type="note_anchor">[ 197 ]</span>which causeth it to seem to themselves vastly greater than it is , and is the prime motive of their setting up in this sad and sorry merchandise . The great power of these goddesses acting in alliance ( whereof as the one is the mother of industry , so is the other of plodding ) was to be exemplified in some one great and remarkable action :[ 198 ] and none could be more so than that which our poet hath chosen , viz ., the restoration of the reign of Chaos and Night , by the ministry of Dulness their daughter , in the removal of her imperial seat from the city to the polite world ; as the action of the Æneid is the restoration of the empire of Troy , by the removal of the race from thence to Latium . But as Homer singing only the wrath of Achilles , yet includes in his poem the whole history of the Trojan war ; in like manner our author hath drawn into this single action the whole history of Dulness and her children .</p>
     <p>A person must next be fixed upon to support this action . This phantom in the poet 's mind must have a name :[ 199 ] He finds it to be ——; and he becomes , of course , the hero of the poem .</p>
     <p>The fable being thus , according to the best example , one and entire , as contained in the proposition , the machinery is a continued chain of allegories , setting forth the whole power , ministry , and empire of Dulness , extended through her subordinate instruments , in all her various operations .</p>
     <p>This is branched into episodes , each of which hath its moral apart , though all conducive to the main end . The crowd assembled in the second book demonstrates the design to be more extensive than to bad poets only , and that we may expect other episodes of the patrons , encouragers , or paymasters of such authors , as occasion shall bring them forth . And the third book , if well considered , seemeth to embrace the whole world . Each of the games relateth to some or other vile class of writers : the first concerneth the Plagiary , to whom he giveth the name of More ; the second the libellous Novelist , whom he styleth Eliza ; the third , the flattering Dedicator ; the fourth , the bawling Critic , or noisy Poet ; the fifth , the dark and dirty Party-writer ; and so of the rest ; assigning to each some proper name or other , such as he could find .</p>
     <p>As for the characters , the public hath already acknowledged how justly they are drawn : the manners are so depicted , and the sentiments so peculiar to those to whom applied , that surely to transfer them to any other or wiser personages would be exceeding difficult : and certain it is , that every person concerned , being consulted apart , hath readily owned the resemblance of every portrait , his own excepted . So Mr Cibber calls them ‘ a parcel of poor wretches , so many silly flies ; ’ but adds , ‘ our author 's wit is remarkably more bare and barren whenever it would fall foul on Cibber , than upon any other person whatever . '[ 200 ]</p>
     <p>The descriptions are singular , the comparisons very quaint , the narration various , yet of one colour . The purity and chastity of diction is so preserved , that in the places most suspicious , not the words but only the images have been censured , and yet are those images no other than have been sanctified by ancient and classical authority ( though , as was the manner of those good times , not so curiously wrapped up ) , yea , and commented upon by the most grave doctors and approved critics .</p>
     <p>As it beareth the name of Epic , it is thereby subjected to such severe indispensable rules as are laid on all neoterics — a strict imitation of the ancients ; insomuch that any deviation , accompanied with whatever poetic beauties , hath always been censured by the sound critic . How exact that imitation hath been in this piece , appeareth not only by its general structure , but by particular allusions infinite , many whereof have escaped both the commentator and poet himself ; yea , divers by his exceeding diligence are so altered and interwoven with the rest , that several have already been , and more will be , by the ignorant abused , as altogether and originally his own .</p>
     <p>In a word , the whole poem proveth itself to be the work of our author when his faculties were in full vigour and perfection , at that exact time when years have ripened the judgment without diminishing the imagination ; which by good critics is held to be punctually at forty . For at that season it was that Virgil finished his Georgics ; and Sir Richard Blackmore at the like age composing his Arthurs , declared the same to be the very acmè and pitch of life for epic poesy — though since he hath altered it to sixty , the year in which he published his Alfred .<span type="note_anchor">[ 201 ]</span>True it is , that the talents for criticism — namely , smartness , quick censure , vivacity of remark , certainty of asseveration , indeed all but acerbity — seem rather the gifts of youth than of riper age . But it is far otherwise in poetry ; witness the works of Mr Rymer and Mr Dennis , who , beginning with criticism , became afterwards such poets as no age hath paralleled . With good reason , therefore , did our author choose to write his essay on that subject at twenty , and reserve for his maturer years this great and wonderful work of the Dunciad .</p>
     <p>P .</p>
     <p>RICARDUS ARISTARCHUS OF THE HERO OF THE POEM .</p>
     <p>Of the nature of Dunciad in general , whence derived , and on what authority founded , as well as of the art and conduct of this our poem in particular , the learned and laborious Scriblerus hath , according to his manner , and with tolerable share of judgment , dissertated . But when he cometh to speak of the person of the hero fitted for such poem , in truth he miserably halts and hallucinates . For , misled by one Monsieur Bossu , a Gallic critic , he prateth of I cannot tell what phantom of a hero , only raised up to support the fable . A putrid conceit ! As if Homer and Virgil , like modern undertakers , who first build their house , and then seek out for a tenant , had contrived the story of a war and a wandering , before they once thought either of Achilles or Æneas . We shall therefore set our good brother and the world also right in this particular , by assuring them , that , in the greater epic , the prime intention of the Muse is to exalt heroic virtue , in order to propagate the love of it among the children of men ; and , consequently , that the poet 's first thought must needs be turned upon a real subject meet for laud and celebration ; not one whom he is to make , but one whom he may find , truly illustrious . This is the primum mobile of his poetic world , whence everything is to receive life and motion . For this subject being found , he is immediately ordained , or rather acknowledged , a hero , and put upon such action as befitteth the dignity of his character .</p>
     <p>But the Muse ceaseth not here her eagle-flight . For sometimes , satiated with the contemplation of these suns of glory , she turneth downward on her wing , and darts with Jove 's lightning on the goose and serpent kind . For we may apply to the Muse , in her various moods , what an ancient master of wisdom affirmeth of the gods in general : ‘ Si Dii non irascuntur impiis et injustis , nec pios utique justosque diligunt . In rebusenim diversis , aut in utramque partem moveri necesse est , aut in neutram . Itaque qui bonos diligit , et malos odit ; et qui malos non odit , nec bonos diligit . Quia et diligere bonos ex odio malorum venit ; et malos odisse ex bonorum caritate descendit . ’ Which , in our vernacular idiom , may be thus interpreted : ‘ If the gods be not provoked at evil men , neither are they delighted with the good and just . For contrary objects must either excite contrary affections , or no affections at all . So that he who loveth good men must at the same time hate the bad ; and he who hateth not bad men cannot love the good ; because to love good men proceedeth from an aversion to evil , and to hate evil men from a tenderness to the good . ’ From this delicacy of the Muse arose the little epic , ( more lively and choleric than her elder sister , whose bulk and complexion incline her to the phlegmatic ) , and for this some notorious vehicle of vice and folly was sought out , to make thereof an example . An early instance of which ( nor could it escape the accurate Scriblerus ) the father of epic poem himself affordeth us . From him the practice descended to the Greek dramatic poets , his offspring , who , in the composition of their tetralogy , or set of four pieces , were wont to make the last a satiric tragedy . Happily one of these ancient Dunciads ( as we may well term it ) is come down unto us amongst the tragedies of the poet Euripides . And what doth the reader suppose may be the subject thereof ? Why , in truth , and it is worthy observation , the unequal contention of an old , dull , debauched buffoon Cyclops , with the heaven-directed favourite of Minerva ; who , after having quietly borne all the monster 's obscene and impious ribaldry , endeth the farce in punishing him with the mark of an indelible brand in his forehead . May we not then be excused , if for the future we consider the epics of Homer , Virgil , and Milton , together with this our poem , as a complete tetralogy , in which the last worthily holdeth the place or station of the satiric piece ?</p>
     <p>Proceed we therefore in our subject . It hath been long , and , alas for pity ! still remaineth a question , whether the hero of the greater epic should be an honest man ? or , as the French critics express it , un honnête homme :[ 202 ] but it never admitted of any doubt , but that the hero of the little epic should be just the contrary . Hence , to the advantage of our Dunciad , we may observe how much juster the moral of that poem must needs be , where so important a question is previously decided .</p>
     <p>But then it is not every knave , nor ( let me add ) every fool , that is a fit subject for a Dunciad . There must still exist some analogy , if not resemblance of qualities , between the heroes of the two poems , and this in order to admit what neoteric critics call the parody , one of the liveliest graces of the little epic . Thus , it being agreed that the constituent qualities of the greater epic hero are wisdom , bravery , and love , from whence springeth heroic virtue ; it followeth that those of the lesser epic hero should be vanity , impudence , and debauchery , from which happy assemblage resulteth heroic dulness , the never-dying subject of this our poem .</p>
     <p>This being confessed , come we now to particulars . It is the character of true wisdom to seek its chief support and confidence within itself , and to place that support in the resources which proceed from a conscious rectitude of will . And are the advantages of vanity , when arising to the heroic standard , at all short of this self-complacence ? Nay , are they not , in the opinion of the enamoured owner , far beyond it ? ‘ Let the world ( will such an one say ) impute to me what folly or weakness they please ; but till wisdom can give me something that will make me more heartily happy , I am content to be gazed at . '[ 203 ] This , we see , is vanity according to the heroic gauge or measure ; not that low and ignoble species which pretendeth to virtues we have not , but the laudable ambition of being gazed at for glorying in those vices which everybody knows we have . ‘ The world may ask ( says he ) why I make my follies public ? Why not ? I have passed my time very pleasantly with them . '[ 204 ] In short , there is no sort of vanity such a hero would scruple , but that which might go near to degrade him from his high station in this our Dunciad — namely , ‘ Whether it would not be vanity in him to take shame to himself for not being a wise man ? '[ 205 ]</p>
     <p>Bravery , the second attribute of the true hero , is courage manifesting itself in every limb ; while its correspondent virtue in the mock hero is that same courage all collected into the face . And as power when drawn together must needs have more force and spirit than when dispersed , we generally find this kind of courage in so high and heroic a degree , that it insults not only men , but gods . Mezentius is , without doubt , the bravest character in all the Æneis . But how ? His bravery , we know , was a high courage of blasphemy . And can we say less of this brave man 's , who , having told us that he placed ‘ his summum bonum in those follies , which he was not content barely to possess , but would likewise glory in , ’ adds , ‘ If I am misguided , ‘ tis nature 's fault , and I follow her . '[ 206 ] Nor can we be mistaken in making this happy quality a species of courage , when we consider those illustrious marks of it which made his face ‘ more known ( as he justly boasteth ) than most in the kingdom , ’ and his language to consist of what we must allow to be the most daring figure of speech , that which is taken from the name of God .</p>
     <p>Gentle love , the next ingredient in the true hero 's composition , is a mere bird of passage , or ( as Shakspeare calls it ) summer-teeming lust , and evaporates in the heat of youth ; doubtless , by that refinement , it suffers in passing through those certain strainers which our poet somewhere speaketh of . But when it is let alone to work upon the lees , it acquireth strength by old age , and becometh a lasting ornament to the little epic . It is true , indeed , there is one objection to its fitness for such a use : for not only the ignorant may think it common , but it is admitted to be so , even by him who best knoweth its value . ‘ Do n't you think , ’ argueth he , ‘ to say only a man has his whore ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 207 ]</span>ought to go for little or nothing ? Because defendit numerus ; take the first ten thousand men you meet , and I believe you would be no loser if you betted ten to one that every single sinner of them , one with another , had been guilty of the same frailty . '[ 208 ] But here he seemeth not to have done justice to himself : the man is sure enough a hero who hath his lady at fourscore . How doth his modesty herein lessen the merit of a whole well-spent life : not taking to himself the commendation ( which Horace accounted the greatest in a theatrical character ) of continuing to the very dregs the same he was from the beginning ,</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">... ‘ Servetur ad imum</l>
       <l n="2">Qualis ab incepto processerat ’ ...</l>
     </lg>
     <p>But here , in justice both to the poet and the hero , let us further remark , that the calling her his whore implieth she was his own , and not his neighbour 's . Truly a commendable continence ! and such as Scipio himself must have applauded . For how much self-denial was exerted not to covet his neighbour 's whore ? and what disorders must the coveting her have occasioned in that society where ( according to this political calculator ) nine in ten of all ages have their concubines !</p>
     <p>We have now , as briefly as we could devise , gone through the three constituent qualities of either hero . But it is not in any , or in all of these , that heroism properly or essentially resideth . It is a lucky result rather from the collision of these lively qualities against one another . Thus , as from wisdom , bravery , and love , ariseth magnanimity , the object of admiration , which is the aim of the greater epic ; so from vanity , impudence , and debauchery , springeth buffoonery , the source of ridicule , that ‘ laughing ornament , ’ as he well termeth it ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 209 ]</span>of the little epic .</p>
     <p>He is not ashamed ( God forbid he ever should be ashamed ! ) of this character , who deemeth that not reason , but risibility , distinguisheth the human species from the brutal . ‘ As nature , ’ saith this profound philosopher , ‘ distinguished our species from the mute creation by our risibility , her design must have been by that faculty as evidently to raise our happiness , as by our os sublime ( our erected faces ) to lift the dignity of our form above them . '[ 210 ] All this considered , how complete a hero must he be , as well as how happy a man , whose risibility lieth not barely in his muscles , as in the common sort , but ( as himself informeth us ) in his very spirits ! and whose os sublime is not simply an erect face , but a brazen head , as should seem by his preferring it to one of iron , said to belong to the late king of Sweden !<span type="note_anchor">[ 211 ]</span></p>
     <p>But whatever personal qualities a hero may have , the examples of Achilles and Aeneas show us , that all those are of small avail without the constant assistance of the gods — for the subversion and erection of empires have never been adjudged the work of man . How greatly soever , then , we may esteem of his high talents , we can hardly conceive his personal prowess alone sufficient to restore the decayed empire of Dulness . So weighty an achievement must require the particular favour and protection of the great — who , being the natural patrons and supporters of letters , as the ancient gods were of Troy , must first be drawn off and engaged in another interest , before the total subversion of them can be accomplished . To surmount , therefore , this last and greatest difficulty , we have , in this excellent man , a professed favourite and intimado of the great . And look , of what force ancient piety was to draw the gods into the party of Aeneas , that , and much stronger , is modern incense , to engage the great in the party of Dulness .</p>
     <p>Thus have we essayed to portray or shadow out this noble imp of fame . But now the impatient reader will be apt to say , if so many and various graces go to the making up a hero , what mortal shall suffice to bear his character ? Ill hath he read who seeth not , in every trace of this picture , that individual , all-accomplished person , in whom these rare virtues and lucky circumstances have agreed to meet and concentre with the strongest lustre and fullest harmony .</p>
     <p>The good Scriblerus indeed — nay , the world itself — might be imposed on , in the late spurious editions , by I can n't tell what sham hero or phantom ; but it was not so easy to impose on him whom this egregious error most of all concerned . For no sooner had the fourth book laid open the high and swelling scene , but he recognised his own heroic acts ; and when he came to the words —</p>
     <p>‘ Soft on her lap her laureate son reclines , ’</p>
     <p>( though laureate imply no more than one crowned with laurel , as befitteth any associate or consort in empire ) , he loudly resented this indignity to violated majesty — indeed , not without cause , he being there represented as fast asleep ; so misbeseeming the eye of empire , which , like that of Providence , should never doze nor slumber . ‘ Hah ! ’ saith he , ‘ fast asleep , it seems ! that 's a little too strong . Pert and dull at least you might have allowed me , but as seldom asleep as any fool . '[ 212 ] However , the injured hero may comfort himself with this reflection , that though it be a sleep , yet it is not the sleep of death , but of immortality . Here he will live<span type="note_anchor">[ 213 ]</span>at least , though not awake ; and in no worse condition than many an enchanted warrior before him . The famous Durandarte , for instance , was , like him , cast into a long slumber by Merlin , the British bard and necromancer ; and his example , for submitting to it with a good grace , might be of use to our hero . For that disastrous knight being sorely pressed or driven to make his answer by several persons of quality , only replied with a sigh — ‘ Patience , and shuffle the cards . '[ 214 ]</p>
     <p>But now , as nothing in this world , no , not the most sacred or perfect things either of religion or government , can escape the sting of envy , methinks I already hear these carpers objecting to the clearness of our hero 's title .</p>
     <p>It would never ( say they ) have been esteemed sufficient to make an hero for the Iliad or Aeneis , that Achilles was brave enough to overturn one empire , or Aeneas pious enough to raise another , had they not been goddess-born , and princes bred . What , then , did this author mean by erecting a player instead of one of his patrons ( a person ‘ never a hero even on the stage ,'[ 215 ]) to this dignity of colleague in the empire of Dulness , and achiever of a work that neither old Omar , Attila , nor John of Leyden could entirely bring to pass ?</p>
     <p>To all this we have , as we conceive , a sufficient answer from the Roman historian , Fabrum esse suae quemque fortunae : That every man is the smith of his own fortune . The politic Florentine , Nicholas Machiavel , goeth still further , and affirmeth that a man needeth but to believe himself a hero to be one of the worthiest . ‘ Let him ( saith he ) but fancy himself capable of the highest things , and he will of course be able to achieve them . ’ From this principle it follows , that nothing can exceed our hero 's prowess ; as nothing ever equalled the greatness of his conceptions . Hear how he constantly paragons himself ; at one time to Alexander the Great and Charles XII of Sweden , for the excess and delicacy of his ambition ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 216 ]</span>to Henry IV of France for honest policy ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 217 ]</span>to the first Brutus , for love of liberty ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 218 ]</span>and to Sir Robert Walpole , for good government while in power .<span type="note_anchor">[ 219 ]</span>At another time , to the godlike Socrates , for his diversions and amusements ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 220 ]</span>to Horace , Montaigne , and Sir William Temple for an elegant vanity that maketh them for ever read and admired ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 221 ]</span>to two Lord Chancellors , for law , from whom , when confederate against him at the bar , he carried away the prize of eloquence ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 222 ]</span>and , to say all in a word , to the right reverend the Lord Bishop of London himself , in the art of writing pastoral letters .<span type="note_anchor">[ 223 ]</span></p>
     <p>Nor did his actions fall short of the sublimity of his conceit . In his early youth he met the Revolution<span type="note_anchor">[ 224 ]</span>face to face in Nottingham , at a time when his betters contented themselves with following her . It was here he got acquainted with old Battle-array , of whom he hath made so honourable mention in one of his immortal odes . But he shone in courts as well as camps . He was called up when the nation fell in labour of this Revolution ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 225 ]</span>and was a gossip at her christening , with the bishop and the ladies .<span type="note_anchor">[ 226 ]</span></p>
     <p>As to his birth , it is true he pretended no relation either to heathen god or goddess ; but , what is as good , he was descended from a maker of both .<span type="note_anchor">[ 227 ]</span>And that he did not pass himself on the world for a hero as well by birth as education was his own fault : for his lineage he bringeth into his life as an anecdote , and is sensible he had it in his power to be thought he was nobody 's son at all :[ 228 ] And what is that but coming into the world a hero ?</p>
     <p>But be it ( the punctilious laws of epic poesy so requiring ) that a hero of more than mortal birth must needs be had , even for this we have a remedy . We can easily derive our hero 's pedigree from a goddess of no small power and authority amongst men , and legitimate and install him after the right classical and authentic fashion : for like as the ancient sages found a son of Mars in a mighty warrior , a son of Neptune in a skilful seaman , a son of Phoebus in a harmonious poet , so have we here , if need be , a son of Fortune in an artful gamester . And who fitter than the offspring of Chance to assist in restoring the empire of Night and Chaos ?</p>
     <p>There is , in truth , another objection , of greater weight , namely , ‘ That this hero still existeth , and hath not yet finished his earthly course . For if Solon said well , that no man could be called happy till his death , surely much less can any one , till then , be pronounced a hero , this species of men being far more subject than others to the caprices of fortune and humour . ’ But to this also we have an answer , that will ( we hope ) be deemed decisive . It cometh from himself , who , to cut this matter short , hath solemnly protested that he will never change or amend .</p>
     <p>With regard to his vanity , he declareth that nothing shall ever part them . ‘ Nature ( saith he ) hath amply supplied me in vanity — a pleasure which neither the pertness of wit nor the gravity of wisdom will ever persuade me to part with . '[ 229 ] Our poet had charitably endeavoured to administer a cure to it : but he telleth us plainly , ‘ My superiors perhaps may be mended by him ; but for my part I own myself incorrigible . I look upon my follies as the best part of my fortune . '[ 230 ] And with good reason : we see to what they have brought him !</p>
     <p>Secondly , as to buffoonery , ‘ Is it ( saith he ) a time of day for me to leave off these fooleries , and set up a new character ? I can no more put off my follies than my skin ; I have often tried , but they stick too close to me ; nor am I sure my friends are displeased with them , for in this light I afford them frequent matter of mirth , &amp; c ., &amp; c .'[ 231 ] Having then so publicly declared himself incorrigible , he is become dead in law ( I mean the law Epopoeian ) , and devolveth upon the poet as his property , who may take him and deal with him as if he had been dead as long as an old Egyptian hero ; that is to say , embowel and embalm him for posterity .</p>
     <p>Nothing therefore ( we conceive ) remaineth to hinder his own prophecy of himself from taking immediate effect . A rare felicity ! and what few prophets have had the satisfaction to see alive ! Nor can we conclude better than with that extraordinary one of his , which is conceived in these oraculous words , ‘ My dulness will find somebody to do it right . '[ 232 ]</p>

     <p>By virtue of the Authority in Us vested by the Act for subjecting poets to the power of a licenser , we have revised this piece ; where finding the style and appellation of King to have been given to a certain pretender , pseudo-poet , or phantom , of the name of Tibbald ; and apprehending the same may be deemed in some sort a reflection on Majesty , or at least an insult on that Legal Authority which has bestowed on another person the crown of poesy : We have ordered the said pretender , pseudo-poet , or phantom , utterly to vanish and evaporate out of this work : And do declare the said Throne of Poesy from henceforth to be abdicated and vacant , unless duly and lawfully supplied by the Laureate himself . And it is hereby enacted , that no other person do presume to fill the same .</p>

      <head>THE DUNCIAD :[ 234 ]</head>

      <head>TO DR JONATHAN SWIFT .</head>
      <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
      <head>The proposition , the invocation , and the inscription . Then the original of the great empire of Dulness , and cause of the continuance thereof . The college of the goddess in the city , with her private academy for poets in particular ; the governors of it , and the four cardinal virtues . Then the poem hastes into the midst of things , presenting her , on the evening of a Lord Mayor 's day , revolving the long succession of her sons , and the glories past and to come . She fixes her eye on Bayes to be the instrument of that great event which is the subject of the poem . He is described pensive among his books , giving up the cause , and apprehending the period of her empire : after debating whether to betake himself to the Church , or to gaming , or to party-writing , he raises an altar of proper books , and ( making first his solemn prayer and declaration ) purposes thereon to sacrifice all his unsuccessful writings . As the pile is kindled , the goddess , beholding the flame from her seat , flies and puts it out by casting upon it the poem of Thulè . She forthwith reveals herself to him , transports him to her temple , unfolds her arts , and initiates him into her mysteries ; then announcing the death of Eusden the poet laureate , anoints him , carries him to court , and proclaims him successor .</head>

      <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
      <head>The king being proclaimed , the solemnity is graced with public games and sports of various kinds ; not instituted by the hero , as by Aeneas in Virgil , but for greater honour by the goddess in person ( in like manner as the games Pythia , Isthmia , &amp; c ., were anciently said to be ordained by the gods , and as Thetis herself appearing , according to Homer , Odyss . xxiv ., proposed the prizes in honour of her son Achilles ) . Hither flock the poets and critics , attended , as is but just , with their patrons and booksellers . The goddess is first pleased , for her disport , to propose games to the booksellers , and setteth up the phantom of a poet , which they contend to overtake . The races described , with their divers accidents . Next , the game for a poetess . Then follow the exercises for the poets , of tickling , vociferating , diving : The first holds forth the arts and practices of dedicators ; the second of disputants and fustian poets ; the third of profound , dark , and dirty party-writers . Lastly , for the critics , the goddess proposes ( with great propriety ) an exercise , not of their parts , but their patience , in hearing the works of two voluminous authors , one in verse , and the other in prose , deliberately read , without sleeping : the various effects of which , with the several degrees and manners of their operation , are here set forth ; till the whole number , not of critics only , but of spectators , actors , and all present , fall fast asleep ; which naturally and necessarily ends the games .</head>

      <head>BOOK THE THIRD .</head>
      <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
      <head>After the other persons are disposed in their proper places of rest , the goddess transports the king to her temple , and there lays him to slumber with his head on her lap ; a position of marvellous virtue , which causes all the visions of wild enthusiasts , projectors , politicians , inamoratos , castle-builders , chemists , and poets . He is immediately carried on the wings of Fancy , and led by a mad poetical Sibyl , to the Elysian shade ; where , on the banks of Lethe , the souls of the dull are dipped by Bavius , before their entrance into this world . There he is met by the ghost of Settle , and by him made acquainted with the wonders of the place , and with those which he himself is destined to perform . He takes him to a mount of vision , from whence he shows him the past triumphs of the empire of Dulness , then the present , and lastly the future : how small a part of the world was ever conquered by science , how soon those conquests were stopped , and those very nations again reduced to her dominion : then distinguishing the island of Great Britain , shows by what aids , by what persons , and by what degrees it shall be brought to her empire . Some of the persons he causes to pass in review before his eyes , describing each by his proper figure , character , and qualifications . On a sudden the scene shifts , and a vast number of miracles and prodigies appear , utterly surprising and unknown to the king himself , till they are explained to be the wonders of his own reign now commencing . On this subject Settle breaks into a congratulation , yet not unmixed with concern , that his own times were but the types of these . He prophesies how first the nation shall be overrun with farces , operas , and shows ; how the throne of Dulness shall be advanced over the theatres , and set up even at Court ; then how her sons shall preside in the seats of arts and sciences ; giving a glimpse , or Pisgah-sight , of the future fulness of her glory , the accomplishment whereof is the subject of the fourth and last book .</head>

      <head>BOOK THE FOURTH .</head>
      <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
      <head>The poet being , in this book , to declare the completion of the prophecies mentioned at the end of the former , makes a new invocation ; as the greater poets are wont , when some high and worthy matter is to be sung . He shows the goddess coming in her majesty to destroy order and science , and to substitute the kingdom of the Dull upon earth ; how she leads captive the Sciences , and silenceth the Muses ; and what they be who succeed in their stead . All her children , by a wonderful attraction , are drawn about her ; and bear along with them divers others , who promote her empire by connivance , weak resistance , or discouragement of Arts ; such as half-wits , tasteless admirers , vain pretenders , the flatterers of Dunces , or the patrons of them . All these crowd round her ; one of them offering to approach her , is driven back by a rival , but she commends and encourages both . The first who speak in form are the geniuses of the schools , who assure her of their care to advance her cause , by confining youth to words , and keeping them out of the way of real knowledge . Their address , and her gracious answer ; with her charge to them and the Universities . The Universities appear by their proper deputies , and assure her that the same method is observed in the progress of education . The speech of Aristarchus on this subject . They are driven off by a band of young gentlemen returned from travel with their tutors ; one of whom delivers to the goddess , in a polite oration , an account of the whole conduct and fruits of their travels ; presenting to her at the same time a young nobleman perfectly accomplished . She receives him graciously , and indues him with the happy quality of want of shame . She sees loitering about her a number of indolent persons abandoning all business and duty , and dying with laziness : to these approaches the antiquary Annius , entreating her to make them virtuosos , and assign them over to him ; but Mummius , another antiquary , complaining of his fraudulent proceeding , she finds a method to reconcile their difference . Then enter a troop of people fantastically adorned , offering her strange and exotic presents : amongst them , one stands forth and demands justice on another , who had deprived him of one of the greatest curiosities in nature ; but he justifies himself so well , that the goddess gives them both her approbation . She recommends to them to find proper employment for the indolents before-mentioned , in the study of butterflies , shells , birds ’ nests , moss , &amp; c ., but with particular caution not to proceed beyond trifles , to any useful or extensive views of nature , or of the Author of nature . Against the last of these apprehensions , she is secured by a hearty address from the minute philosophers and freethinkers , one of whom speaks in the name of the rest . The youth thus instructed and principled , are delivered to her in a body , by the hands of Silenus ; and then admitted to taste the cup of the Magus her high-priest , which causes a total oblivion of all obligations , divine , civil , moral , or rational . To these her adepts she sends priests , attendants , and comforters , of various kinds ; confers on them orders and degrees ; and then dismissing them with a speech , confirming to each his privileges , and telling what she expects from each , concludes with a yawn of extraordinary virtue : the progress and effects whereof on all orders of men , and the consummation of all , in the restoration of Night and Chaos , conclude the poem .</head>

      <head>A DECLARATION .</head>
      <head>Whereas certain haberdashers of points and particles , being instigated by the spirit of pride , and assuming to themselves the name of critics and restorers , have taken upon them to adulterate the common and current sense of our glorious ancestors , poets of this realm , by clipping , coining , defacing the images , mixing their own base alloy , or otherwise falsifying the same ; which they publish , utter , and vend as genuine : The said haberdashers having no right thereto , as neither heirs , executors , administrators , assigns , or in any sort related to such poets , to all or any of them : Now we , having carefully revised this our Dunciad ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 452 ]</span>beginning with the words ‘ The Mighty Mother , ’ and ending with the words ‘ buries all , ’ containing the entire sum of one thousand seven hundred and fifty-four verses , declare every word , figure , point , and comma of this impression to be authentic : And do therefore strictly enjoin and forbid any person or persons whatsoever , to erase , reverse , put between hooks , or by any other means , directly or indirectly , change or mangle any of them .

    <head>APPENDIX TO THE DUNCIAD .</head>
    <p n="1">I .— PREFACE</p>
    <p n="2">PREFIXED TO THE FIVE FIRST IMPERFECT EDITIONS OF THE DUNCIAD , IN THREE BOOKS , PRINTED AT DUBLIN AND LONDON , IN OCTAVO AND DUODECIMO , 1727 .</p>
    <p n="3">THE PUBLISHER TO THE READER .</p>
    <p n="4">It will be found a true observation , though somewhat surprising , that when any scandal is vented against a man of the highest distinction and character , either in the state or in literature , the public in general afford it a most quiet reception ; and the larger part accept it as favourably as if it were some kindness done to themselves : whereas , if a known scoundrel or blockhead but chance to be touched upon , a whole legion is up in arms , and it becomes the common cause of all scribblers , booksellers , and printers whatsoever .</p>
    <p n="5">Not to search too deeply into the reason hereof , I will only observe as a fact , that every week for these two months past , the town has been persecuted with pamphlets , advertisements , letters , and weekly essays , not only against the wit and writings , but against the character and person of Mr Pope . And that of all those men who have received pleasure from his works , which by modest computation may be about a hundred thousand in these kingdoms of England and Ireland ( not to mention Jersey , Guernsey , the Orcades , those in the new world , and foreigners who have translated him into their languages ) , of all this number not a man hath stood up to say one word in his defence .</p>
    <p n="6">The only exception is the author of the following poem , who , doubtless , had either a better insight into the grounds of this clamour , or a better opinion of Mr Pope 's integrity , joined with a greater personal love for him , than any other of his numerous friends and admirers .</p>
    <p n="7">Further , that he was in his peculiar intimacy , appears from the knowledge he manifests of the most private authors of all the anonymous pieces against him , and from his having in this poem attacked no man living , who had not before printed or published some scandal against this gentleman .</p>
    <p n="8">How I came possessed of it is no concern to the reader ; but it would have been a wrong to him had I detained the publication , since those names which are its chief ornaments die off daily so fast , as must render it too soon unintelligible . If it provoke the author to give us a more perfect edition , I have my end .</p>
    <p n="9">Who he is I cannot say , and ( which is a great pity ) there is certainly nothing in his style and manner of writing which can distinguish or discover him : for if it bears any resemblance to that of Mr Pope , ‘ tis not improbable but it might be done on purpose , with a view to have it pass for his . But by the frequency of his allusions to Virgil , and a laboured ( not to say affected ) shortness in imitation of him , I should think him more an admirer of the Roman poet than of the Grecian , and in that not of the same taste with his friend .</p>
    <p n="10">I have been well informed , that this work was the labour of full six years of his life , and that he wholly retired himself from all the avocations and pleasures of the world , to attend diligently to its correction and perfection ; and six years more he intended to bestow upon it , as it should seem by this verse of Statius , which was cited at the head of his manuscript —</p>
    <p n="11">‘ Oh mihi bissenos multum vigilata per annos , Duncia ! ’</p>
    <p n="12">Hence , also , we learn the true title of the poem ; which , with the same certainty as we call that of Homer the Iliad , of Virgil the Aeneid , of Camoens the Lusiad , we may pronounce , could have been , and can be no other than</p>
    <p n="13">THE DUNCIAD .</p>
    <p n="14">It is styled heroic , as being doubly so : not only with respect to its nature , which , according to the best rules of the ancients , and strictest ideas of the moderns , is critically such ; but also with regard to the heroical disposition and high courage of the writer , who dared to stir up such a formidable , irritable , and implacable race of mortals .</p>
    <p n="15">There may arise some obscurity in chronology from the names in the poem , by the inevitable removal of some authors , and insertion of others in their niches . For whoever will consider the unity of the whole design , will be sensible that the poem was not made for these authors , but these authors for the poem . I should judge that they were clapped in as they rose , fresh and fresh , and changed from day to day ; in like manner as when the old boughs wither , we thrust new ones into a chimney .</p>
    <p n="16">I would not have the reader too much troubled or anxious , if he cannot decipher them ; since when he shall have found them out , he will probably know no more of the persons than before .</p>
    <p n="17">Yet we judged it better to preserve them as they are , than to change them for fictitious names ; by which the satire would only be multiplied , and applied to many instead of one . Had the hero , for instance , been called Codrus , how many would have affirmed him to have been Mr T ., Mr E ., Sir R. B ., &amp; c .; but now all that unjust scandal is saved by calling him by a name , which by good luck happens to be that of a real person .</p>

    <p n="83">III .— ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION — WITH NOTES ,</p>
    <p n="84">IN QUARTO , 1729 .</p>
    <p n="85">It will be sufficient to say of this edition , that the reader has here a much more correct and complete copy of the Dunciad than has hitherto appeared . I cannot answer but some mistakes may have slipped into it , but a vast number of others will be prevented by the names being now not only set at length , but justified by the authorities and reasons given . I make no doubt the author 's own motive to use real rather than feigned names , was his care to preserve the innocent from any false application ; whereas , in the former editions , which had no more than the initial letters , he was made , by Keys printed here , to hurt the inoffensive , and ( what was worse ) to abuse his friends , by an impression at Dublin .</p>
    <p n="86">The commentary which attends this poem was sent me from several hands , and consequently must be unequally written ; yet will have one advantage over most commentaries , that it is not made upon conjectures , or at a remote distance of time : and the reader cannot but derive one pleasure from the very obscurity of the persons it treats of , that it partakes of the nature of a secret , which most people love to be let into , though the men or the things be ever so inconsiderable or trivial .</p>
    <p n="87">Of the persons it was judged proper to give some account ; for since it is only in this monument that they must expect to survive ( and here survive they will , as long as the English tongue shall remain such as it was in the reigns of Queen Anne and King George ) , it seemed but humanity to bestow a word or two upon each , just to tell what he was , what he writ , when he lived , and when he died .</p>
    <p n="88">If a word or two more are added upon the chief offenders , it is only as a paper pinned upon the breast , to mark the enormities for which they suffered ; lest the correction only should be remembered , and the crime forgotten . In some articles it was thought sufficient barely to transcribe from Jacob , Curll , and other writers of their own rank , who were much better acquainted with them than any of the authors of this comment can pretend to be . Most of them had drawn each other 's characters on certain occasions ; but the few here inserted are all that could be saved from the general destruction of such works .</p>
    <p n="89">Of the part of Scriblerus , I need say nothing ; his manner is well enough known , and approved by all but those who are too much concerned to be judges .</p>
    <p n="90">The Imitations of the Ancients are added , to gratify those who either never read , or may have forgotten them ; together with some of the parodies and allusions to the most excellent of the Moderns . If , from the frequency of the former , any man think the poem too much a Cento , our poet will but appear to have done the same thing in jest which Boileau did in earnest ; and upon which Vida , Fracastorius , and many of the most eminent Latin poets , professedly valued themselves .</p>
    <p n="91">IV .— ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION OF THE FOURTH BOOK OF THE DUNCIAD ,</p>
    <p n="92">WHEN PRINTED SEPARATELY IN THE YEAR 1742 .</p>
    <p n="93">We apprehend it can be deemed no injury to the author of the three first books of the Dunciad that we publish this fourth . It was found merely by accident in taking a survey of the library of a late eminent nobleman ; but in so blotted a condition , and in so many detached pieces , as plainly showed it to be not only incorrect , but unfinished . That the author of the three first books had a design to extend and complete his poem in this manner appears from the dissertation prefixed to it , where it is said that the design is more extensive , and that we may expect other episodes to complete it ; and from the declaration in the argument to the third book , that the accomplishment of the prophecies therein would be the theme hereafter of a greater Dunciad . But whether or no he be the author of this , we declare ourselves ignorant . If he be , we are no more to be blamed for the publication of it than Tucca and Varius for that of the last six books of the Aeneid , though perhaps inferior to the former .</p>
    <p n="94">If any person be possessed of a more perfect copy of this work , or of any other fragments of it , and will communicate them to the publisher , we shall make the next edition more complete : in which we also promise to insert any criticisms that shall be published ( if at all to the purpose ) with the names of the authors ; or any letters sent us ( though not to the purpose ) shall yet be printed under the title of Epistolae Obscurorum Virorum ; which , together with some others of the same kind formerly laid by for that end , may make no unpleasant addition to the future impressions of this poem .</p>
    <p n="95">V .— ADVERTISEMENT TO THE COMPLETE EDITION of 1743 .</p>
    <p n="96">I have long had a design of giving some sort of Notes on the works of this poet . Before I had the happiness of his acquaintance , I had written a commentary on his Essay on Man , and have since finished another on the Essay on Criticism . There was one already on the Dunciad , which had met with general approbation ; but I still thought some additions were wanting ( of a more serious kind ) to the humorous notes of Scriblerus , and even to those written by Mr Cleland , Dr Arbuthnot , and others . I had lately the pleasure to pass some months with the author in the country , where I prevailed upon him to do what I had long desired , and favour me with his explanation of several passages in his works . It happened that just at that juncture was published a ridiculous book against him , full of personal reflections , which furnished him with a lucky opportunity of improving this poem , by giving it the only thing it wanted — a more considerable hero . He was always sensible of its defect in that particular , and owned he had let it pass with the hero it had purely for want of a better ; not entertaining the least expectation that such an one was reserved for this post as has since obtained the Laurel : but since that had happened , he could no longer deny this justice either to him or the Dunciad .</p>
    <p n="97">And yet I will venture to say , there was another motive which had still more weight with our author . This person was one who from every folly ( not to say vice ) of which another would be ashamed has constantly derived a vanity ; and therefore was the man in the world who would least be hurt by it .</p>

    <p n="99">VI .— ADVERTISEMENT PRINTED IN THE JOURNALS , 1730 .</p>
    <p n="100">Whereas , upon occasion of certain pieces relating to the gentlemen of the Dunciad , some have been willing to suggest , as if they looked upon them as an abuse : we can do no less than own it is our opinion , that to call these gentlemen bad authors is no sort of abuse , but a great truth . We cannot alter this opinion without some reason ; but we promise to do it in respect to every person who thinks it an injury to be represented as no wit , or poet , provided he procures a certificate of his being really such , from any three of his companions in the Dunciad , or from Mr Dennis singly , who is esteemed equal to any three of the number .</p>
    <p n="101">VII .— A PARALLEL OF THE CHARACTERS OF MR DRYDEN AND MR POPE ,</p>
    <p n="102">AS DRAWN BY CERTAIN OF THEIR CONTEMPORARIES .</p>
    <p n="103">MR DRYDEN — HIS POLITICS , RELIGION , MORALS .</p>
    <p n="104">MR DRYDEN is a mere renegado from monarchy , poetry , and good sense<span type="note_anchor">[ 453 ]</span>— a true republican son of monarchical Church<span type="note_anchor">[ 454 ]</span>— a republican atheist .<span type="note_anchor">[ 455 ]</span>Dryden was from the beginning an [ Greek : alloprosallos ] , and I doubt not will continue so to the last .<span type="note_anchor">[ 456 ]</span></p>
    <p n="105">In the poem called Absalom and Achitophel are notoriously traduced , the King , the Queen , the Lords and Gentlemen , not only their honourable persons exposed , but the whole nation and its representatives notoriously libelled . It is scandalum magnatum , yea of majesty itself .<span type="note_anchor">[ 457 ]</span></p>
    <p n="106">He looks upon God 's gospel as a foolish fable , like the Pope , to whom he is a pitiful purveyor .<span type="note_anchor">[ 458 ]</span>His very Christianity may be questioned .<span type="note_anchor">[ 459 ]</span>He ought to expect more severity than other men , as he is most unmerciful in his own reflections on others .<span type="note_anchor">[ 460 ]</span>With as good a right as his holiness , he sets up for poetical infallibility .<span type="note_anchor">[ 461 ]</span></p>
    <p n="107">MR DRYDEN ONLY A VERSIFIER .</p>
    <p n="108">His whole libel is all bad matter , beautified ( which is all that can be said of it ) with good metre .<span type="note_anchor">[ 462 ]</span>Mr Dryden 's genius did not appear in any thing more than his versification , and whether he is to be ennobled for that only is a question .<span type="note_anchor">[ 463 ]</span></p>
    <p n="109">MR DRYDEN 'S VIRGIL .</p>
    <p n="110">Tonson calls it Dryden 's Virgil , to show that this is not that Virgil so admired in the Augustaean age ; but a Virgil of another stamp , a silly , impertinent , nonsensical writer .<span type="note_anchor">[ 464 ]</span>None but a Bavius , a Maevius , or a Bathyllus carped at Virgil ; and none but such unthinking vermin admire his translator .<span type="note_anchor">[ 465 ]</span>It is true , soft and easy lines might become Ovid 's Epistles or Art of Love ; but Virgil , who is all great and majestic , &amp; c ., requires strength of lines , weight of words , and closeness of expressions — not an ambling muse running on carpet-ground , and shod as lightly as a Newmarket racer . He has numberless faults in his author 's meaning , and in propriety of expression .<span type="note_anchor">[ 466 ]</span></p>
    <p n="111">MR DRYDEN UNDERSTOOD NO GREEK NOR LATIN .</p>
    <p n="112">Mr Dryden was once , I have heard , at Westminster school . Dr Bushby would have whipped him for so childish a paraphrase .<span type="note_anchor">[ 467 ]</span>The meanest pedant in England would whip a lubber of twelve for construing so absurdly .<span type="note_anchor">[ 468 ]</span>The translator is mad , every line betrays his stupidity .<span type="note_anchor">[ 469 ]</span>The faults are innumerable , and convince me that Mr Dryden did not , or would not understand his author .<span type="note_anchor">[ 470 ]</span>This shows how fit Mr D. may be to translate Homer ! A mistake in a single letter might fall on the printer well enough , but [ Greek : eichor ] for [ Greek : ichor ] must be the error of the author . Nor had he art enough to correct it at the press .<span type="note_anchor">[ 471 ]</span>Mr Dryden writes for the court ladies . He writes for the ladies , and not for use .<span type="note_anchor">[ 472 ]</span></p>
    <p n="113">The translator puts in a little burlesque now and then into Virgil , for a ragout to his cheated subscribers .<span type="note_anchor">[ 473 ]</span></p>
    <p n="114">MR DRYDEN TRICKED HIS SUBSCRIBERS .</p>
    <p n="115">I wonder that any man , who could not but be conscious of his own unfitness for it , should go to amuse the learned world with such an undertaking ! A man ought to value his reputation more than money ; and not to hope that those who can read for themselves will be imposed upon , merely by a partially and unseasonably celebrated name .<span type="note_anchor">[ 474 ]</span>Poetis quidlibei audendi shall be Mr Dryden 's motto , though it should extend to picking of pockets .<span type="note_anchor">[ 475 ]</span></p>
    <p n="116">NAMES BESTOWED ON MR DRYDEN .</p>
    <p n="117">An Ape .— A crafty ape dressed up in a gaudy gown — whips put into an ape 's paw , to play pranks with — none but apish and papish brats will heed him .<span type="note_anchor">[ 476 ]</span></p>
    <p n="118">An Ass .— A camel will take upon him no more burden than is sufficient for his strength , but there is another beast that crouches under all .<span type="note_anchor">[ 477 ]</span></p>
    <p n="119">A Frog .— Poet Squab endued with Poet Maro 's spirit ! an ugly croaking kind of vermin , which would swell to the bulk of an ox .<span type="note_anchor">[ 478 ]</span></p>
    <p n="120">A Coward .— A Clinias or a Damaetas , or a man of Mr Dryden 's own courage .<span type="note_anchor">[ 479 ]</span></p>
    <p n="121">A Knave .— Mr Dryden has heard of Paul , the knave of Jesus Christ ; and , if I mistake not , I 've read somewhere of John Dryden , servant to his Majesty .<span type="note_anchor">[ 480 ]</span></p>
    <p n="122">A Fool .— Had he not been such a self-conceited fool .<span type="note_anchor">[ 481 ]</span>— Some great poets are positive blockheads .<span type="note_anchor">[ 482 ]</span></p>
    <p n="123">A Thing .— So little a thing as Mr Dryden .<span type="note_anchor">[ 483 ]</span></p>
    <p n="124">MR POPE — HIS POLITICS , RELIGION , MORALS .</p>
    <p n="125">MR POPE is an open and mortal enemy to his country , and the commonwealth of learning .<span type="note_anchor">[ 484 ]</span>Some call him a Popish Whig , which is directly inconsistent .<span type="note_anchor">[ 485 ]</span>Pope , as a papist , must be a Tory and High-flyer .<span type="note_anchor">[ 486 ]</span>He is both a Whig and Tory .<span type="note_anchor">[ 487 ]</span></p>
    <p n="126">He hath made it his custom to cackle to more than one party in their own sentiments .<span type="note_anchor">[ 488 ]</span></p>
    <p n="127">In his miscellanies , the persons abused are — the King , the Queen , his late Majesty , both Houses of Parliament , the Privy Council , the Bench of Bishops , the Established Church , the present Ministry , &amp; c. To make sense of some passages , they must be construed into royal scandal .<span type="note_anchor">[ 489 ]</span></p>
    <p n="128">He is a popish rhymester , bred up with a contempt of the Sacred Writings .<span type="note_anchor">[ 490 ]</span>His religion allows him to destroy heretics , not only with his pen , but with fire and sword ; and such were all those unhappy wits whom he sacrificed to his accursed popish principles .<span type="note_anchor">[ 491 ]</span>It deserved vengeance to suggest that Mr Pope had less infallibility than his namesake at Rome .<span type="note_anchor">[ 492 ]</span></p>
    <p n="129">MR POPE ONLY A VERSIFIER .</p>
    <p n="130">The smooth numbers of the Dunciad are all that recommend it , nor has it any other merit .<span type="note_anchor">[ 493 ]</span>It must be owned that he hath got a notable knack of rhyming and writing smooth verse .<span type="note_anchor">[ 494 ]</span></p>
    <p n="131">MR POPE 'S HOMER .</p>
    <p n="132">The Homer which Lintot prints does not talk like Homer , but like Pope ; and he who translated him , one would swear , had a hill in Tipperary for his Parnassus , and a puddle in some bog for his Hippocrene .<span type="note_anchor">[ 495 ]</span>He has no admirers among those that can distinguish , discern , and judge .<span type="note_anchor">[ 496 ]</span>He hath a knack at smooth verse , but without either genius or good sense , or any tolerable knowledge of English . The qualities which distinguish Homer are the beauties of his diction and the harmony of his versification . But this little author , who is so much in vogue , has neither sense in his thoughts nor English in his expressions .<span type="note_anchor">[ 497 ]</span></p>
    <p n="133">MR POPE UNDERSTOOD NO GREEK .</p>
    <p n="134">He hath undertaken to translate Homer from the Greek , of which he knows not one word , into English , of which he understands as little .<span type="note_anchor">[ 498 ]</span>I wonder how this gentleman would look , should it be discovered that he has not translated ten verses together in any book of Homer with justice to the poet , and yet he dares reproach his fellow-writers with not understanding Greek .<span type="note_anchor">[ 499 ]</span>He has stuck so little to his original as to have his knowledge in Greek called in question .<span type="note_anchor">[ 500 ]</span>I should be glad to know which it is of all Homer 's excellencies which has so delighted the ladies , and the gentlemen who judge like ladies .<span type="note_anchor">[ 501 ]</span></p>
    <p n="135">But he has a notable talent at burlesque ; his genius slides so naturally into it , that he hath burlesqued Homer without designing it .<span type="note_anchor">[ 502 ]</span></p>
    <p n="136">MR POPE TRICKED HIS SUBSCRIBERS .</p>
    <p n="137">‘ Tis indeed somewhat bold , and almost prodigious , for a single man to undertake such a work ; but ‘ tis too late to dissuade by demonstrating the madness of the project . The subscribers ’ expectations have been raised in proportion to what their pockets have been drained of .<span type="note_anchor">[ 503 ]</span>Pope has been concerned in jobs , and hired out his name to booksellers .<span type="note_anchor">[ 504 ]</span></p>
    <p n="138">NAMES BESTOWED ON MR POPE .</p>
    <p n="139">An Ape .— Let us take the initial letter of his Christian name , and the initial and final letters of his surname , viz ., A P E , and they give you the same idea of an ape as his face ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 505 ]</span>&amp; c .</p>
    <p n="140">An Ass .— It is my duty to pull off the lion 's skin from this little ass .<span type="note_anchor">[ 506 ]</span></p>
    <p n="141">A Frog .— A squab short gentleman — a little creature that , like the frog in the fable , swells , and is angry that it is not allowed to be as big as an ox .<span type="note_anchor">[ 507 ]</span></p>
    <p n="142">A Coward .— A lurking , way-laying coward .<span type="note_anchor">[ 508 ]</span></p>
    <p n="143">A Knave .— He is one whom God and nature have marked for want of common honesty .<span type="note_anchor">[ 509 ]</span></p>
    <p n="144">A Fool .— Great fools will be christened by the names of great poets , and Pope will be called Homer .<span type="note_anchor">[ 510 ]</span></p>
    <p n="145">A Thing .— A little abject thing .<span type="note_anchor">[ 511 ]</span></p>

That accurate and punctual man of letters , the restorer of Shakespeare , constantly observes the preservation of this very letter e , in spelling the name of his beloved author , and not like his common careless editors , with the omission of one , nay , sometimes of two e 's ( as Shakspear ) , which is utterly unpardonable . ‘ Nor is the neglect of a single letter so trivial as to some it may appear ; the alteration whereof in a learned language is an achievement that brings honour to the critic who advances it ; and Dr Bentley will be remembered to posterity for his performances of this sort , as long as the world shall have any esteem for the remains of Menander and Philemon . ’ — Theobald .</item>
     <item>This is surely a slip in the learned author of the foregoing note , there having been since produced by an accurate antiquary , an autograph of Shakspeare himself , whereby it appears that he spelled his own name without the first e. And upon this authority it was , that those most critical curators of his monument in Westminster Abbey erased the former wrong reading , and restored the true spelling on a new piece of old Egyptian granite . Nor for this only do they deserve our thanks , but for exhibiting on the same monument the first specimen of an edition of an author in marble ; where ( as may be seen on comparing the tomb with the book ) , in the space of five lines , two words and a whole verse are changed , and it is to be hoped will there stand , and outlast whatever hath been hitherto done in paper ; as for the future , our learned sister University ( the other eye of England ) is taking care to perpetuate a total new Shakspeare , at the Clarendon press .— Bentl .</item>
     <item>It is to be noted , that this great critic also has omitted one circumstance : which is , that the inscription with the name of Shakspeare was intended to be placed on the marble scroll to which he points with his hand ; instead of which it is now placed behind his back , and that specimen of an edition is put on the scroll , which indeed Shakspeare hath great reason to point at .— Anon .</item>
     <item>Though I have as just a value for the letter e as any grammarian living , and the same affection for the name of this poem as any critic for that of his author , yet cannot it induce me to agree with those who would add yet another e to it , and call it the Dunceiade ; which being a French and foreign termination , is no way proper to a word entirely English and vernacular . One e , therefore , in this case is right , and two e 's wrong . Yet , upon the whole , I shall follow the manuscript , and print it without any e at all ; moved thereto by authority ( at all times , with critics , equal , if not superior to reason ) . In which method of proceeding , I can never enough praise my good friend , the exact Mr Thomas Hearne ; who , if any word occur which to him and all mankind is evidently wrong , yet keeps he it in the text with due reverence , and only remarks in the margin sic MS . In like manner we shall not amend this error in the title itself , but only note it obiter , to evince to the learned that it was not our fault , nor any effect of our ignorance or inattention .— Scriblerus .</item>
     <item>This poem was written in the year 1726 . In the next year , an imperfect edition was published at Dublin , and reprinted at London in twelves ; another at Dublin , and another at London in octavo ; and three others in twelves the same year . But there was no perfect edition before that of London in quarto ; which was attended with notes . We are willing to acquaint posterity , that this poem was presented to King George the Second and his queen by the hands of Sir Robert Walpole , on the 12th of March 1728-9 .— Schol . Vet .</item>
     <item>It was expressly confessed in the preface to the first edition , that this poem was not published by the author himself . It was printed originally in a foreign country . And what foreign country ? Why , one notorious for blunders ; where finding blanks only instead of proper names , these blunderers filled them up at their pleasure .</item>
     <item>The very hero of the poem hath been mistaken to this hour ; so that we are obliged to open our notes with a discovery who he really was . We learn from the former editor , that this piece was presented by the hands of Sir Robert Walpole to King George II . Now the author directly tells us , his hero is the man</item>
     <item>‘ who brings The Smithfield muses to the ear of kings . ’</item>
     <item>And it is notorious who was the person on whom this prince conferred the honour of the laurel .</item>
     <item>It appears as plainly from the apostrophe to the great in the third verse , that Tibbald could not be the person , who was never an author in fashion , or caressed by the great ; whereas this single characteristic is sufficient to point out the true hero , who , above all other poets of his time , was the peculiar delight and chosen companion of the nobility of England , and wrote , as he himself tells us , certain of his works at the earnest desire of persons of quality .</item>
     <item>Lastly , the sixth verse affords full proof ; this poet being the only one who was universally known to have had a son so exactly like him , in his poetical , theatrical , political , and moral capacities , that it could justly be said of him ,</item>
     <item>‘ Still Dunce the second reign 'd like Dunce the first . ’ — Bentl .</item>
     <item><span type="note_anchor">[ 235 ]</span>‘ Her son who brings , ’ &amp; c. Wonderful is the stupidity of all the former critics and commentators on this work ! It breaks forth at the very first line . The author of the critique prefixed to Sawney , a poem , p. 5 , hath been so dull as to explain ‘ the man who brings , ’ &amp; c ., not of the hero of the piece , but of our poet himself , as if he vaunted that kings were to be his readers — an honour which though this poem hath had , yet knoweth he how to receive it with more modesty .</item>

     <item>I cite the whole three verses , that I may by the way offer a conjectural emendation , purely my own , upon each : First , oris should be read aris , it being , as we see , Aen . ii . 513 , from the altar of Jupiter Hercaeus that Aeneas fled as soon as he saw Priam slain . In the second line I would flatu for fato , since it is most clear it was by winds that he arrived at the shore of Italy . Jactatus , in the third , is surely as improperly applied to terris , as proper to alto . To say a man is tossed on land , is much at one with saying , he walks at sea . Risum teneatis , amici ?

     <item><span type="note_anchor">[ 240 ]</span>‘ Laborious , heavy , busy , bold , ’ &amp; c. I wonder the learned Scriblerus has omitted to advertise the reader , at the opening of this poem , that Dulness here is not to be taken contractedly for mere stupidity , but in the enlarged sense of the word , for all slowness of apprehension , shortness of sight , or imperfect sense of things . It includes ( as we see by the poet 's own words ) labour , industry , and some degree of activity and boldness — a ruling principle not inert , but turning topsy-turvy the understanding , and inducing an anarchy or confused state of mind . This remark ought to be carried along with the reader throughout the work ; and without this caution he will be apt to mistake the importance of many of the characters , as well as of the design of the poet . Hence it is , that some have complained he chooses too mean a subject , and imagined he employs himself like Domitian , in killing flies ; whereas those who have the true key will find he sports with nobler quarry , and embraces a larger compass ; or ( as one saith , on a like occasion ) —</item>

     <item><span type="note_anchor">[ 300 ]</span>‘ Stood dauntless Curll : ’ we come now to a character of much respect , that of Mr Edmund Curll . As a plain repetition of great actions is the best praise of them , we shall only say of this eminent man , that he carried the trade many lengths beyond what it ever before had arrived at ; and that he was the envy and admiration of all his profession . He possessed himself of a command over all authors whatever ; he caused them to write what he pleased ; they could not call their very names their own . He was not only famous among these ; he was taken notice of by the state , the church , and the law , and received particular marks of distinction from each . It will be owned that he is here introduced with all possible dignity : he speaks like the intrepid Diomede ; he runs like the swift-footed Achilles ; if he falls , ‘ tis like the beloved Nisus ; and ( what Homer makes to be the chief of all praises ) he is favoured of the gods ; he says but three words , and his prayer is heard ; a goddess conveys it to the seat of Jupiter : though he loses the prize , he gains the victory ; the great mother herself comforts him , she inspires him with expedients , she honours him with an immortal present ( such as Achilles receives from Thetis , and Aeneas from Venus ) at once instructive and prophetical : after this he is unrivalled and triumphant . The tribute our author here pays him is a grateful return for several unmerited obligations . Many weighty animadversions on the public affairs , and many excellent and diverting pieces on private persons , has he given to his name . If ever he owed two verses to any other , he owed Mr Curll some thousands . He was every day extending his fame , and enlarging his writings : witness innumerable instances ; but it shall suffice only to mention the Court Poems , which he meant to publish as the work of the true writer , a lady of quality ; but being first threatened , and afterwards punished for it by Mr Pope , he generously transferred it from her to him , and ever since printed it in his name . The single time that ever he spoke to C. was on that affair , and to that happy incident he owed all the favours since received from him : so true is the saying of Dr Sydenham , ‘ that any one shall be , at some time or other , the better or the worse for having but seen or spoken to a good or bad man . ’ — P .</item>
