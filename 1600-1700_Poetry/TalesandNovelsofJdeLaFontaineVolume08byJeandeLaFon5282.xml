    <head>THE EEL PIE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">HOWEVER exquisite we BEAUTY find ,</l>
     <l n="2">It satiates sense , and palls upon the mind :</l>
     <l n="3">Brown bread as well as white must be for me ;</l>
     <l n="4">My motto ever is — VARIETY .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">THAT brisk brunette , with languid , sleepy eye ,</l>
     <l n="6">Delights my fancy ; Can you tell me why ?</l>
     <l n="7">The reason ‘ s plain enough :— she ‘ s something new .</l>
     <l n="8">The other mistress , long within my view ,</l>
     <l n="9">Though lily fair , with seraph features blessed ,</l>
     <l n="10">No more emotion raises in my breast ;</l>
     <l n="11">Her heart assents , while mine reluctant proves ;</l>
     <l n="12">Whence this diversity that in us moves ?</l>
     <l n="13">From hence it rises , to be plain and free ,</l>
     <l n="14">My motto ever is — VARIETY .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">THE same in other words , I 've often said ;</l>
     <l n="16">‘ Tis right , at times , disguise with care to spread .</l>
     <l n="17">The maxim 's good , and with it I agree :</l>
     <l n="18">My motto ever is — VARIETY .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">A CERTAIN spouse the same devise had got ,</l>
     <l n="20">Whose wife by all was thought a handsome lot .</l>
     <l n="21">His love , howe'er , was over very soon ;</l>
     <l n="22">It lasted only through the honeymoon ;</l>
     <l n="23">Possession had his passion quite destroyed ;</l>
     <l n="24">In Hymen 's bands too oft the lover ‘ s cloyed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">ONE , ‘ mong his valets , had a pretty wife ;</l>
     <l n="26">The master was himself quite full of life ,</l>
     <l n="27">And soon the charmer to his wishes drew ,</l>
     <l n="28">With which the husband discontented grew ,</l>
     <l n="29">And having caught them in the very fact ,</l>
     <l n="30">He rang his mate the changes for the act ;</l>
     <l n="31">Sad names he called her , howsoever just ,</l>
     <l n="32">A silly blockhead ! thus to raise a dust ,</l>
     <l n="33">For what , in ev'ry town ‘ s so common found ;</l>
     <l n="34">May we worse fortune never meet around !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="35">HE made the paramour a grave harangue</l>
     <l n="36">Do n't others give , said he , the poignant pang ;</l>
     <l n="37">But ev'ry one allow to keep his own ,</l>
     <l n="38">As God and reason oft to man have shown ,</l>
     <l n="39">And recommended fully to observe ;</l>
     <l n="40">You from it surely have not cause to swerve ;</l>
     <l n="41">You cannot plead that you for beauty pine</l>
     <l n="42">You 've one at home who far surpasses mine ;</l>
     <l n="43">No longer give yourself such trouble , pray :</l>
     <l n="44">You , to my help-mate , too much honour pay ;</l>
     <l n="45">Such marked attentions she can ne'er require</l>
     <l n="46">Let each of us , alone his own admire .</l>
     <l n="47">To others ’ WELLs you never ought to go ,</l>
     <l n="48">While your 's with sweets is found to overflow ;</l>
     <l n="49">I willingly appeal to connoisseurs ;</l>
     <l n="50">If heav'n had blessed me with such bliss as your 's ,</l>
     <l n="51">That when I please , your lady I could take ,</l>
     <l n="52">I would not for a queen such charms forsake .</l>
     <l n="53">But since we can n't prevent what now is known ,</l>
     <l n="54">I wish , good sir , contented with your own ,</l>
     <l n="55">( And ‘ tis , I hope , without offence I speak ,)</l>
     <l n="56">You 'll favours from my wife no longer seek .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="57">THE master , neither no nor yes replied ,</l>
     <l n="58">But orders gave , his man they should provide ;</l>
     <l n="59">For dinner ev'ry day , what pleased his taste ,</l>
     <l n="60">A pie of eels , which near him should be placed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="61">HIS appetite at first was wond'rous great ;</l>
     <l n="62">Again , the second time , as much he ate ;</l>
     <l n="63">But when the third appeared , he felt disgust ,</l>
     <l n="64">And not another morsel down could thrust .</l>
     <l n="65">The valet fain would try a diff'rent dish ;</l>
     <l n="66">‘ Twas not allowed ;— you 've got , said they , your wish ;</l>
     <l n="67">‘ Tis pie alone ; you like it best you know ,</l>
     <l n="68">And no objection you must dare to show .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="69">I 'M surfeited , cried he , ‘ tis far too much :</l>
     <l n="70">Pie ev'ry day ! and nothing else to touch !</l>
     <l n="71">Not e'en a roasted eel , or stewed , or fried !</l>
     <l n="72">Dry bread I 'd rather you 'd for me provide .</l>
     <l n="73">Of your 's allow me some at any rate ,</l>
     <l n="74">Pies , ( devil take them ! ) thoroughly I hate ;</l>
     <l n="75">They 'll follow me to Paradise I fear ,</l>
     <l n="76">Or further yet ;— Heav'n keep me from such cheer !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="77">THEIR noisy mirth the master thither drew ,</l>
     <l n="78">Who much desired the frolick to pursue ;</l>
     <l n="79">My friend , said he , I greatly feel surprise ,</l>
     <l n="80">That you so soon are weary grown of pies ;</l>
     <l n="81">Have I not heard you frequently declare ,</l>
     <l n="82">Eel-pie ‘ s of all , the most delicious fare ?</l>
     <l n="83">Quite fickle , certainly , must be your taste ;</l>
     <l n="84">Can any thing in me so strange be traced ?</l>
     <l n="85">When I exchange a food which you admire ;</l>
     <l n="86">You blame and say , I never ought to tire ;</l>
     <l n="87">You do the very same ; in truth , my friend ,</l>
     <l n="88">No mark of folly ‘ tis , you may depend ,</l>
     <l n="89">In lord or squire , or citizen or clown ,</l>
     <l n="90">To change the bread that 's white for bit of brown :</l>
     <l n="91">With more experience , you 'll with me agree ,—</l>
     <l n="92">My motto ever is — VARIETY .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="93">WHEN thus the master had himself expressed ,</l>
     <l n="94">The valet presently was less distressed ;</l>
     <l n="95">Some arguments , howe'er , at first he used ;</l>
     <l n="96">For , after all — are fully we excused ,</l>
     <l n="97">When we our pleasure solely have in view ;</l>
     <l n="98">Without regarding what 's to others due ?</l>
     <l n="99">I relish change ; well , take it ; but ‘ tis best ,</l>
     <l n="100">To gain the belles with love of gold possessed ;</l>
     <l n="101">And that appears to me the proper plan ;</l>
     <l n="102">In truth , our lover very soon began</l>
     <l n="103">To practise this advice ;— his voice and way</l>
     <l n="104">Could angel-sweetness instantly convey .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="105">HIS words were always gilt ; ( impressive tongue ! )</l>
     <l n="106">To gilded words will sure success belong .</l>
     <l n="107">In soft amours they 're ev'ry thing ‘ tis plain</l>
     <l n="108">The maxim ‘ s certain , and our aim will gain ;</l>
     <l n="109">My meaning doubtless easily is seen ;</l>
     <l n="110">A hundred times repeated this has been</l>
     <l n="111">Th ’ impression should be made so very deep ,</l>
     <l n="112">That I thereon can never silence keep ;</l>
     <l n="113">And this the constant burden of my song-</l>
     <l n="114">To gilded words will sure success belong .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="115">THEY easily persuade the beauteous dame ;</l>
     <l n="116">Her dog , her maid , duenna , all the same ;</l>
     <l n="117">The husband sometimes too , and him we 've shown</l>
     <l n="118">‘ Twas necessary here to gain alone ;</l>
     <l n="119">By golden eloquence his soul was lulled ;</l>
     <l n="120">Although from ancient orators not culled :</l>
     <l n="121">Their books retained have nothing of the kind ;</l>
     <l n="122">Our jealous spouse indulgent grew we find .</l>
     <l n="123">He followed e'en , ‘ tis said , the other 's plan —</l>
     <l n="124">And , thence his dishes to exchange began .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="125">THE master and his fav'rite ' s freaks around ;</l>
     <l n="126">Continually the table-talk were found ;</l>
     <l n="127">He always thought the newest face the best :</l>
     <l n="128">Where'er he could , each beauty he caressed ;</l>
     <l n="129">The wife , the widow , daughter , servant-maid ,</l>
     <l n="130">The nymph of field or town :— with all he played ;</l>
     <l n="131">And , while he breathed , the same would always be ;</l>
     <l n="132">His motto ever was — VARIETY .</l>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE MAGNIFICENT</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">SOME wit , handsome form and gen'rous mind ;</l>
     <l n="2">A triple engine prove in love we find ;</l>
     <l n="3">By these the strongest fortresses are gained</l>
     <l n="4">E'en rocks ‘ gainst such can never be sustained .</l>
     <l n="5">If you 've some talents , with a pleasing face ,</l>
     <l n="6">Your purse-strings open free , and you 've the place .</l>
     <l n="7">At times , no doubt , without these things , success</l>
     <l n="8">Attends the gay gallant , we must confess ;</l>
     <l n="9">But then , good sense should o'er his actions rule ;</l>
     <l n="10">At all events , he must not be a fool .</l>
     <l n="11">The stingy , women ever will detest ;</l>
     <l n="12">Words puppies want ;— the lib'ral are the best .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">A Florentine , MAGNIFICENT by name ,</l>
     <l n="14">Was what we 've just described , in fact and fame ;</l>
     <l n="15">The title was bestowed upon the knight ,</l>
     <l n="16">For noble deeds performed by him in fight .</l>
     <l n="17">The honour ev'ry way he well deserved ;</l>
     <l n="18">His upright conduct ( whence he never swerved ,)</l>
     <l n="19">Expensive equipage , and presents made ,</l>
     <l n="20">Proclaimed him all around what we 've pourtrayed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="21">WITH handsome person and a pleasing mien ,</l>
     <l n="22">Gallant , a polished air , and soul serene ;</l>
     <l n="23">A certain fair of noble birth he sought ,</l>
     <l n="24">Whose conquest , doubtless , brilliant would be thought ;</l>
     <l n="25">Which in our lover doubly raised desire ;</l>
     <l n="26">Renown and pleasure lent his bosom fire .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="27">THE jealous husband of the beauteous fair</l>
     <l n="28">Was Aldobrandin , whose suspicious care</l>
     <l n="29">Resembled more , what frequently is shown</l>
     <l n="30">For fav'rites mistresses , than wives alone .</l>
     <l n="31">He watched her every step with all his eyes ;</l>
     <l n="32">A hundred thousand scarcely would suffice ;</l>
     <l n="33">Indeed , quite useless Cupid these can make ;</l>
     <l n="34">And Argus oft is subject to mistake :</l>
     <l n="35">Repeatedly they 're duped , although our wight ,</l>
     <l n="36">( Who fancied he in ev'ry thing was right ,)</l>
     <l n="37">Himself so perfectly secure believed ,</l>
     <l n="38">By gay gallants he ne'er could be deceived .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="39">TO suitors , howsoe'er , he was not blind ;</l>
     <l n="40">To covet presents , greatly he inclined .</l>
     <l n="41">The lover yet had no occasion found ,</l>
     <l n="42">To drop a word to charms so much renowned ;</l>
     <l n="43">He thought his passion was not even seen ;</l>
     <l n="44">And if it had , would things have better been ?</l>
     <l n="45">What would have followed ? what had been the end ?</l>
     <l n="46">The reader needs no hint to comprehend .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="47">BUT to return to our forlorn gallant ,</l>
     <l n="48">Whose bosom for the lady 's ‘ gan to pant ;</l>
     <l n="49">He , to his doctor , not a word had said ;</l>
     <l n="50">Now here , now there , he tried to pop his head .</l>
     <l n="51">But neither door nor window could he find ,</l>
     <l n="52">Where he might glimpse the object of his mind ,</l>
     <l n="53">Or even hear her voice , or sound her name ;</l>
     <l n="54">No fortress had he ever found the same ;</l>
     <l n="55">Yet still to conquer he was quite resolved ,</l>
     <l n="56">And oft the manner in his mind revolved .</l>
     <l n="57">This plan at length he thought would best succeed ,</l>
     <l n="58">To execute it doubtless he had need</l>
     <l n="59">Of ev'ry wily art he could devise ,</l>
     <l n="60">Surrounded as he was by eagle-eyes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="61">I THINK the reader I 've already told ,</l>
     <l n="62">Our husband loved rich presents to behold ;</l>
     <l n="63">Though none he made , yet all he would receive ;</l>
     <l n="64">Whate'er was offered he would never leave .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="65">MAGNIFICENT a handsome horse had got ,</l>
     <l n="66">It ambled well , or cantered , or would trot ;</l>
     <l n="67">He greatly valued it , and for its pace ,</l>
     <l n="68">‘ Twas called the Pad ; it stept with wond'rous grace :</l>
     <l n="69">By Aldobrandin it was highly praised ;</l>
     <l n="70">Enough was this : the knight 's fond hopes were raised ;</l>
     <l n="71">Who offered to exchange , but t'other thought ,</l>
     <l n="72">He in a barter might perhaps be caught .</l>
     <l n="73">‘ Tis not , said he , that I the horse refuse ;</l>
     <l n="74">But I , in trucking , never fail to lose .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="75">ON this , Magnificent , who saw his aim ;</l>
     <l n="76">Replied , well , well , a better scheme we 'll frame ;</l>
     <l n="77">No changing we 'll allow , but you 'll permit ,</l>
     <l n="78">That for the horse , I with your lady sit ,</l>
     <l n="79">You present all the while , ‘ tis what I want ;</l>
     <l n="80">I 'm curious , I confess , and fort it pant .</l>
     <l n="81">Besides , your friends assuredly should know</l>
     <l n="82">What mind , what sentiments may from her flow .</l>
     <l n="83">Just fifteen minutes , I no more desire :</l>
     <l n="84">What ! cried the other , you my wife require ?</l>
     <l n="85">No , no , pray keep your horse , that wo n't be right .</l>
     <l n="86">But you 'll be present , said the courteous knight .</l>
     <l n="87">And what of that ? rejoined the wily spouse .</l>
     <l n="88">Why , cried Magnificent , then naught should rouse</l>
     <l n="89">Your fears or cares , for how can ill arise ,</l>
     <l n="90">While watched by you , possessed of eagle-eyes ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="91">THE husband ‘ gan to turn it in his mind ;</l>
     <l n="92">Thought he , if present , what can be designed ?</l>
     <l n="93">The plan is such as dissipates my fears ;</l>
     <l n="94">The offer advantageous too appears ;</l>
     <l n="95">He 's surely mad ; I can n't conceive his aim ;</l>
     <l n="96">But , to secure myself and wife from shame ;</l>
     <l n="97">Without his knowledge , I 'll forbid the fair</l>
     <l n="98">Her lips to open , and for this prepare .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="99">COME , cried old Aldobrandin , I 'll consent :</l>
     <l n="100">But , said the other , recollect ‘ tis meant ,</l>
     <l n="101">So distant from us , all the while you stay ,</l>
     <l n="102">That not a word you hear of what I say .</l>
     <l n="103">Agreed , rejoined the husband :— let 's begin ;</l>
     <l n="104">Away he flew , and brought the lady in .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="105">WHEN our gallant the charming belle perceived ;</l>
     <l n="106">Elysium seemed around , he half believed .</l>
     <l n="107">The salutations o'er , they went and sat</l>
     <l n="108">Together in a corner , where their chat</l>
     <l n="109">Could not be heard , if they to talk inclined ;</l>
