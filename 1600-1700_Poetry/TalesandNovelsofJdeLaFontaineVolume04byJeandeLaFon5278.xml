    <head>THE OLD MAN 'S CALENDAR</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">OFT have I seen in wedlock with surprise ,</l>
     <l n="2">That most forgot from which true bliss would rise</l>
     <l n="3">When marriage for a daughter is designed ,</l>
     <l n="4">The parents solely riches seem to mind ;</l>
     <l n="5">All other boons are left to heav'n above ,</l>
     <l n="6">And sweet SIXTEEN must SIXTY learn to love !</l>
     <l n="7">Yet still in other things they nicer seem ,</l>
     <l n="8">Their chariot-horses and their oxen-team</l>
     <l n="9">Are truly matched ;— in height exact are these ,</l>
     <l n="10">While those each shade alike must have to please ;</l>
     <l n="11">Without the choice ‘ twere wonderful to find ,</l>
     <l n="12">Or coach or wagon travel to their mind .</l>
     <l n="13">The marriage journey full of cares appears ,</l>
     <l n="14">When couples match in neither souls nor years !</l>
     <l n="15">An instance of the kind I 'll now detail :</l>
     <l n="16">The feeling bosom will such lots bewail !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="17">QUINZICA , ( Richard ) , as the story goes ,</l>
     <l n="18">Indulged his wife at balls , and feasts , and shows ,</l>
     <l n="19">Expecting other duties she 'd forget ,</l>
     <l n="20">In which howe'er he disappointment met .</l>
     <l n="21">A judge in Pisa , Richard was , it seems ,</l>
     <l n="22">In law most learned : wily in his schemes ;</l>
     <l n="23">But silver beard and locks too clearly told ,</l>
     <l n="24">He ought to have a wife of diff'rent mould ;</l>
     <l n="25">Though he had taken one of noble birth ,</l>
     <l n="26">Quite young , most beautiful , and formed for mirth ,</l>
     <l n="27">Bartholomea Galandi her name ;</l>
     <l n="28">The lady 's parents were of rank and fame ;</l>
     <l n="29">Our JUDGE herein had little wisdom shown ,</l>
     <l n="30">And sneering friends around were often known</l>
     <l n="31">To say , his children ne'er could fathers lack :</l>
     <l n="32">At giving counsel some have got a knack ,</l>
     <l n="33">Who , were they but at home to turn their eyes ,</l>
     <l n="34">Might find , perhaps , they 're not so over-wise .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="35">QUINZICA , then perceiving that his pow'rs</l>
     <l n="36">Fell short of what a bird like his devours ,</l>
     <l n="37">T'excuse himself and satisfy his dear ,</l>
     <l n="38">Pretended that , no day within the year ,</l>
     <l n="39">To Hymen , as a saint , was e'er assigned ,</l>
     <l n="40">In calendar , or book of any kind ,</l>
     <l n="41">When full ATTENTION to the god was paid :—</l>
     <l n="42">To aged sires a nice convenient aid ;</l>
     <l n="43">But this the sex by no means fancy right ;</l>
     <l n="44">Few days to PLEASURE could his heart invite</l>
     <l n="45">At times , the week entire he 'd have a fast ;</l>
     <l n="46">At others , say the day ‘ mong saints was classed ,</l>
     <l n="47">Though no one ever heard its holy name ;—</l>
     <l n="48">FAST ev'ry Friday — Saturday the same ,</l>
     <l n="49">Since Sunday followed , consecrated day ;</l>
     <l n="50">Then Monday came :— still he 'd abstain from play ;</l>
     <l n="51">Each morning find excuse , but solemn feasts</l>
     <l n="52">Were days most sacred held by all the priests ;</l>
     <l n="53">On abstinence , then , Richard lectures read ,</l>
     <l n="54">And long before the time , was always led</l>
     <l n="55">By sense of right , from dainties to refrain :</l>
     <l n="56">A period afterward would also gain ;</l>
     <l n="57">The like observed before and after Lent ;</l>
     <l n="58">And ev'ry feast had got the same extent ;</l>
     <l n="59">These times were gracious for our aged man ;</l>
     <l n="60">And never pass them was his constant plan .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="61">OF patron saints he always had a list ;</l>
     <l n="62">Th ’ evangelists , apostles , none he miss 'd ;</l>
     <l n="63">And that his scruples might have constant food ;</l>
     <l n="64">Some days malign , he said , were understood ;</l>
     <l n="65">Then foggy weather ;— dog-days ’ fervent heat :</l>
     <l n="66">To seek excuses he was most complete ,</l>
     <l n="67">And ne'er asham 'd but manag 'd things so well ,</l>
     <l n="68">Four times a year , by special grace , they tell ,</l>
     <l n="69">Our sage regal 'd his youthful blooming wife ,</l>
     <l n="70">A little with the sweets of marriage life .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="71">WITH this exception he was truly kind ,</l>
     <l n="72">Fine dresses , jewels , all to please her mind ;</l>
     <l n="73">But these are bawbles which alone controul</l>
     <l n="74">Those belles , like dolls , mere bodies void of soul .</l>
     <l n="75">Bartholomea was of diff'rent clay ;</l>
     <l n="76">Her only pleasure ( as our hist'ries say ) ,</l>
     <l n="77">To go in summer to the neighb'ring coast ,</l>
     <l n="78">Where her good spouse a charming house could boast ,</l>
     <l n="79">In which they took their lodging once a week ;</l>
     <l n="80">At times they pleasure on the waves would seek ,</l>
     <l n="81">As fishing with the lady would agree ,</l>
     <l n="82">And she was wond'rous partial to the sea ,</l>
     <l n="83">Though far to sail they always would refuse .</l>
     <l n="84">One day it happened better to amuse ,</l>
     <l n="85">Our couple diff'rent fishing vessels took ,</l>
     <l n="86">And skimm 'd the wave to try who most could hook ,</l>
     <l n="87">Of fish and pleasure ; and they laid a bet ,</l>
     <l n="88">The greatest number which of them should get .</l>
     <l n="89">On board they had a man or two at most .</l>
     <l n="90">And each the best adventure hop 'd to boast .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="91">A CERTAIN pirate soon observ 'd the ship ,</l>
     <l n="92">In which this charming lady made the trip ,</l>
     <l n="93">And presently attack 'd and seiz 'd the same ;</l>
     <l n="94">But Richard 's bark to shore in safety came ;</l>
     <l n="95">So near the land , or else he would not brave ,</l>
     <l n="96">To any great extent , the stormy wave ,</l>
     <l n="97">Or that the robber thought if both he took ,</l>
     <l n="98">He could not decently for favours look ,</l>
     <l n="99">And he preferr 'd those joys the FAIR bestow ,</l>
     <l n="100">To all the riches which to mortals flow .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="101">ALTHOUGH a pirate , he had always shown</l>
     <l n="102">Much honour in his acts , as well was known ;</l>
     <l n="103">But Cupid 's frolicks were his heart 's delight :</l>
     <l n="104">None truly brave can ever beauty slight ;</l>
     <l n="105">A sailor 's always bold and kind and free ,</l>
     <l n="106">Good lib'ral fellows , such they 'll ever be ;</l>
     <l n="107">‘ Mong saints indeed ‘ twere vain their names to seek !</l>
     <l n="108">The man was good howe'er of whom we speak ;</l>
     <l n="109">His usual name was Pagamin Montegue ;</l>
     <l n="110">For hours the lady 's screams were heard a league ,</l>
     <l n="111">While he each minute anxiously would seize ,</l>
     <l n="112">To cheer her spirits and her heart to please ;</l>
     <l n="113">T'attain his wish he ev'ry art combined ;</l>
     <l n="114">At length the lovely captive all resigned .</l>
     <l n="115">‘ Twas Cupid conquer 'd , Cupid with his dart ;</l>
     <l n="116">A thousand times more pirate in his art ,</l>
     <l n="117">Than Pagamin ; on bleeding hearts he preys ,</l>
     <l n="118">But little quarter gives , nor grace displays :</l>
     <l n="119">To pay her ransom she 'd enough of gold ;</l>
     <l n="120">For this her spouse was truly never cold ;</l>
     <l n="121">No fast nor festival therein appear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="122">And her captivity he greatly fear 'd .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="123">THIS calendar o'erspread with rubrick days ;</l>
     <l n="124">She soon forgot and learn 'd the pirate 's ways ;</l>
     <l n="125">The matrimonial zone aside was thrown ,</l>
     <l n="126">And only mentioned where the fact was known :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="127">OUR lawyer would his fingers sooner burn ;</l>
     <l n="128">Than have his wife but virtuous home return ;</l>
     <l n="129">By means of gold he entertain 'd no doubt ,</l>
     <l n="130">Her restoration might be brought about .</l>
     <l n="131">A passport from the pirate he obtain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="132">Then waited on him and his wish explain 'd ;</l>
     <l n="133">To pay he offer 'd what soe'er he 'd ask ;</l>
     <l n="134">His terms accept , though hard perhaps the task ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="135">THE robber answer 'd , if my name around ,</l>
     <l n="136">Be not for honourable acts renown 'd ,</l>
     <l n="137">‘ Tis quite unjust :— your partner I 'll restore</l>
     <l n="138">In health , without a ransom :— would you more ?</l>
     <l n="139">A friendship so respect 'd , heav'n forefend !</l>
     <l n="140">Should ever , by my conduct , have an end .</l>
     <l n="141">The fair , whom you so ardently admire ,</l>
     <l n="142">Shall to your arms return as you desire ,</l>
     <l n="143">Such pleasure to a friend I would not sell ;</l>
     <l n="144">Convince me that she 's your 's , and all is well ;</l>
     <l n="145">For if another I to you should give ,</l>
     <l n="146">( And many that I 've taken with me live ,)</l>
     <l n="147">I surely should incur a heavy blame ;</l>
     <l n="148">I lately captur 'd one , a charming dame ,</l>
     <l n="149">With auburn locks , a little fat , tall , young ;</l>
     <l n="150">If she declare she does to you belong ,</l>
     <l n="151">When you she 's seen , I will the belle concede ;</l>
     <l n="152">You 'll take her instantly ; I 'll not impede .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="153">THE sage replied , your conduct 's truly wise ;</l>
     <l n="154">Such wond'rous kindness fills me with surprise ;</l>
     <l n="155">But since ‘ tis said that every trade must live ,</l>
     <l n="156">The sum just mention :— I 'll the ransom give ;</l>
     <l n="157">No compliment I wish , my purse behold</l>
     <l n="158">You know the money presently is told ;</l>
     <l n="159">Consider me a stranger now I pray ;</l>
     <l n="160">With you I 'd equal probity display ,</l>
     <l n="161">And so will act , I swear , as you shall see ;</l>
     <l n="162">There ‘ s not a doubt the fair will go with me ;</l>
     <l n="163">My word for this I would not have you take :—</l>
     <l n="164">You 'll see how happy ‘ twill the lady make</l>
     <l n="165">To find me here ; to my embrace she 'll fly ;</l>
     <l n="166">My only fears — that she of joy will die .</l>
     <l n="167">To them the charmer now was instant brought ,</l>
     <l n="168">Who eyed her husband as beneath a thought ;</l>
     <l n="169">Received him coldly , just as if he 'd been</l>
     <l n="170">A stranger from Peru , she ne'er had seen .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="171">LOOK , said Quinzica , she 's ashamed ‘ tis plain</l>
     <l n="172">So many lookers on her love restrain ;</l>
     <l n="173">But be assured , if we were left alone ,</l>
     <l n="174">Around my neck her arms would soon be thrown .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="175">IF this , replied the pirate , you believe ,</l>
     <l n="176">Attend her toilet :— naught can then deceive .</l>
     <l n="177">Away they went , and closely shut the door ;</l>
     <l n="178">When Richard said , thou darling of my store ,</l>
     <l n="179">How can'st thou thus behave ? my pretty dove ,</l>
     <l n="180">‘ Tis thy Quinzica , come to seek his love ,</l>
     <l n="181">In all the same , except about his wife ;</l>
     <l n="182">Dost in this face a change observe my life ?</l>
     <l n="183">‘ Tis grieving for thy loss that makes me ill ;</l>
     <l n="184">Did ever I in aught deny thy will ?</l>
     <l n="185">In dress or play could any thee exceed ?</l>
     <l n="186">And had'st thou not whatever thou might'st need ?</l>
     <l n="187">To please thee , oft I made myself a slave ;</l>
     <l n="188">Such thou art now ; but thee again I crave .</l>
     <l n="189">Then what dost think about thy honour , dear ?—</l>
     <l n="190">Said she , with ire , I neither know nor fear ;</l>
     <l n="191">Is this a time to guard it , do you say ?</l>
     <l n="192">What pain was shown by any one , I pray ;</l>
     <l n="193">When I was forc 'd to wed a man like you ,</l>
     <l n="194">Old , impotent , and hateful to the view ,</l>
     <l n="195">While I was young and blooming as the morn ,</l>
     <l n="196">Deserving truly , something less forlorn ,</l>
     <l n="197">And seemingly intended to possess</l>
     <l n="198">What Hymen best in store has got to bless ;</l>
     <l n="199">For I was thought by all the world around ,</l>
     <l n="200">Most worthy ev'ry bliss in wedlock found .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="201">YET things took quite another turn with me</l>
     <l n="202">In tune my husband never proved to be ,</l>
     <l n="203">Except a feast or two throughout the year ;</l>
     <l n="204">From Pagamin I met a diff'rent cheer ;</l>
     <l n="205">Another lesson presently he taught ;</l>
     <l n="206">The life 's sweet pleasures more the pirate brought ,</l>
     <l n="207">In two short days , than e'er I had from you</l>
     <l n="208">In those four years that only you I knew .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="209">PRAY leave me husband :— let me have my will</l>
     <l n="210">Insist not on my living with you still ;</l>
     <l n="211">No calendars with Pagamin are seen —</l>
     <l n="212">Far better treated with the man I 've been .</l>
     <l n="213">My other friends and you much worse deserved :</l>
     <l n="214">The spouse , for taking me when quite unnerved ,</l>
     <l n="215">And they , for giving preference base to gold ,</l>
     <l n="216">To those pure joys — far better thought than told .</l>
     <l n="217">But Pagamin in ev'ry way can please ;</l>
     <l n="218">And though no code he owns , yet all is ease ;</l>
     <l n="219">Himself will tell you what has passed this morn ,</l>
     <l n="220">His actions would a sov'reign prince adorn .</l>
     <l n="221">Such information may excite surprise ,</l>
     <l n="222">But now the truth , ‘ twere useless to disguise ,</l>
     <l n="223">Nothing will gain belief , we 've no one near</l>
     <l n="224">To witness our discourse :— adieu , my dear ,</l>
     <l n="225">To all your festivals — I 'm flesh and blood :—</l>
     <l n="226">Gems , dresses , ornaments , do little good ;</l>
     <l n="227">You know full well , betwixt the head and heel ,</l>
     <l n="228">Though little 's said , yet much we often feel .</l>
     <l n="229">On this she stopt , and Richard dropt his chin ,</l>
     <l n="230">Rejoiced to ‘ scape from such unwelcome din .</l>

     <l n="235">That soon he left this busy stage of life ,</l>
     <l n="236">And Pagamin the widow took to wife .</l>

     <l n="248">TRICKING GALLANT</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="249">WHO knows the world will never feel surprise ,</l>
     <l n="250">When men are duped by artful women 's eves ;</l>
     <l n="251">Though death his weapon freely will unfold ;</l>
     <l n="252">Love 's pranks , we find , are ever ruled by gold .</l>
     <l n="253">To vain coquettes I doubtless here allude ;</l>
     <l n="254">But spite of arts with which they 're oft endued ;</l>
     <l n="255">I hope to show ( our honour to maintain ,)</l>
     <l n="256">We can , among a hundred of the train ,</l>
     <l n="257">Catch one at least , and play some cunning trick :—</l>
     <l n="258">For instance , take blithe Gulphar 's wily nick ,</l>
     <l n="259">Who gained ( old soldier-like ) his ardent aim ,</l>
     <l n="260">And gratis got an avaricious dame .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="261">LOOK well at this , ye heroes of the sword ,</l>
     <l n="262">Howe'er with wily freaks your heads be stored ,</l>
     <l n="263">Beyond a doubt , at court I now could find ,</l>
     <l n="264">A host of lovers of the Gulphar kind .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="265">To Gasperin 's so often went our wight ,</l>
     <l n="266">The wife at length became his sole delight ,</l>
     <l n="267">Whose youth and beauty were by all confessed ;</l>
     <l n="268">But , ‘ midst these charms , such av'rice she possessed ,</l>
     <l n="269">The warmest love was checked — a thing not rare ,</l>
     <l n="270">In modern times at least , among the FAIR .</l>
     <l n="271">‘ Tis true , as I 've already said , with such</l>
     <l n="272">Sighs naught avail , and promises not much ;</l>
     <l n="273">Without a purse , who wishes should express ,</l>
     <l n="274">Would vainly hope to gain a soft caress .</l>
     <l n="275">The god of love no other charm employs ,</l>
     <l n="276">Then cards , and dress , and pleasure 's cheering joys ;</l>
     <l n="277">From whose gay shops more cuckolds we behold ,</l>
     <l n="278">Than heroes sallied from Troy 's horse of old .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="279">BUT to our lady 's humour let 's adhere ;</l>
     <l n="280">Sighs passed for naught : they entered not her ear ;</l>
     <l n="281">‘ Twas speaking only would the charmer please ,</l>
     <l n="282">The reader , without doubt , my meaning sees ;</l>
     <l n="283">Gay Gulphar plainly spoke , and named a sum</l>
     <l n="284">A hundred pounds , she listened :— was o'ercome .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="285">OUR wight the cash by Gasperin was lent ;</l>
     <l n="286">And then the husband to the country went ,</l>
     <l n="287">Without suspecting that his loving mate ,</l>
     <l n="288">Designed with horns to ornament his pate .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="289">THE money artful Gulphar gave the dame ,</l>
     <l n="290">While friends were round who could observe the same ;</l>
     <l n="291">Here , said the spark , a hundred pounds receive ,</l>
     <l n="292">‘ Tis for your spouse :— the cash with you I leave .</l>
     <l n="293">The lady fancied what the swain had said ,</l>
     <l n="294">Was policy , and to concealment led .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="295">NEXT morn our belle regaled the arch gallant ,</l>
     <l n="296">Fulfilled his promise :— and his eager want .</l>
     <l n="297">Day after day he followed up the game ;</l>
     <l n="298">For cash he took , and int'rest on the same ;</l>
     <l n="299">Good payers get , we always may conclude ,</l>
     <l n="300">Full measure served , whatever is pursued .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="301">WHEN Gasperin returned , our crafty wight ,</l>
     <l n="302">Before the wife addressed her spouse at sight ;</l>
     <l n="303">Said he the cash I 've to your lady paid ,</l>
     <l n="304">Not having ( as I feared ) required its aid ;</l>
     <l n="305">To save mistakes , pray cross it in your book ;</l>
     <l n="306">The lady , thunderstruck , with terror shook ;</l>
     <l n="307">Allowed the payment ; ‘ twas a case too clear ;</l>
     <l n="308">In truth for character she ‘ gan to fear .</l>
     <l n="309">But most howe'er she grudged the surplus joy ,</l>
     <l n="310">Bestowed on such a vile , deceitful boy .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="311">THE loss was doubtless great in ev'ry view</l>
     <l n="312">Around the town the wicked Gulphar flew ;</l>
     <l n="313">In all the streets , at every house to tell ,</l>
     <l n="314">How nicely he had trick 'd the greedy belle .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="315">To blame him useless ‘ twere you must allow ;</l>
     <l n="316">The French such frolicks readily avow .</l>

    <head>THE JEALOUS HUSBAND</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A CERTAIN husband who , from jealous fear ,</l>
     <l n="2">With one eye slept while t'other watched his dear ,</l>
     <l n="3">Deprived his wife of every social joy ,</l>
     <l n="4">( Friends oft the jealous character annoy ,)</l>
     <l n="5">And made a fine collection in a book ,</l>
     <l n="6">Of tricks with which the sex their wishes hook .</l>
     <l n="7">Strange fool ! as if their wiles , to speak the truth ,</l>

     <l n="9">HIS wife howe'er engaged his constant cares ;</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">THIS arch collection , like a prayer-book bound ;</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">ONE holy day , it happened that our dame ,</l>
     <l n="20">As from the neighb'ring church she homeward came ;</l>

     <l n="23">WITH anxious care apologies were made ;</l>
     <l n="24">The lady , frightened by the frolick played ,</l>
     <l n="25">Quite unsuspicious to the mansion went ;</l>
     <l n="26">Her aged friend for other clothes she sent ,</l>

     <l n="33">NOT wrong he proved , for , truly to confess ;</l>
     <l n="34">This throwing dirt upon the lady 's dress</l>
     <l n="35">Was done to get the hag , with Argus ’ eyes</l>
     <l n="36">Removed a certain distance from the prize .</l>
     <l n="37">The gay gallant , who watched the lucky hour ,</l>

    <head>THE GASCON PUNISHED</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A GASCON ( being heard one day to swear ,</l>
     <l n="2">That he 'd possess 'd a certain lovely fair ,)</l>
     <l n="3">Was played a wily trick , and nicely served ;</l>
     <l n="4">‘ Twas clear , from truth he shamefully had swerved :</l>
     <l n="5">But those who scandal propagate below ,</l>
     <l n="6">Are prophets thought , and ev'ry action know ;</l>
     <l n="7">While good , if spoken , scarcely is believed ,</l>
     <l n="8">And must be viewed , or not for truth received .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">THE dame , indeed , the Gascon only jeered ,</l>
     <l n="10">And e'er denied herself when he appeared ;</l>
     <l n="11">But when she met the wight , who sought to shine ;</l>
     <l n="12">And called her angel , beauteous and divine ,</l>
     <l n="13">She fled and hastened to a female friend ,</l>
     <l n="14">Where she could laugh , and at her ease unbend .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">NEAR Phillis , ( our fair fugitive ) there dwelled</l>
     <l n="16">One Eurilas , his nearest neighbour held ;</l>
     <l n="17">His wife was Cloris ; ‘ twas with her our dove</l>
     <l n="18">Took shelter from the Gascon 's forward love ,</l>
     <l n="19">Whose name was Dorilas ; and Damon young ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="21">SWEET Phillis , by her manner , you might see ,</l>
     <l n="22">From sly amours and dark intrigues was free ;</l>
     <l n="23">The value to possess her no one knew ,</l>
     <l n="24">Though all admired the lovely belle at view .</l>
     <l n="25">Just twenty years she counted at the time ,</l>
     <l n="26">And now a widow was , though in her prime ,</l>
     <l n="27">( Her spouse , an aged dotard , worth a plum :—</l>
     <l n="28">Of those whose loss to mourn no tears e'er come . )</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="29">OUR seraph fair , such loveliness possessed ,</l>
     <l n="30">In num'rous ways a Gascon could have blessed ;</l>
     <l n="31">Above , below , appeared angelic charms ;</l>
     <l n="32">‘ Twas Paradise , ‘ twas Heav'n , within her arms !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="33">THE Gascon was — a Gascon ;— would you more ?</l>
     <l n="34">Who knows a Gascon knows at least a score .</l>
     <l n="35">I need not say what solemn vows he made ;</l>
     <l n="36">Alike with Normans Gascons are portrayed ;</l>
     <l n="37">Their oaths , indeed , wo n't pass for Gospel truth ;</l>
     <l n="38">But we believe that Dorilas ( the youth )</l>
     <l n="39">Loved Phillis to his soul , our lady fair ,</l>
     <l n="40">Yet he would fain be thought successful there .</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="41">ONE day , said Phillis , with unusual glee ,</l>
     <l n="42">Pretending with the Gascon to be free :—</l>
     <l n="43">A favour do me :— nothing very great ;</l>
     <l n="44">Assist to dupe one jealous of his mate ;</l>
     <l n="45">You 'll find it very easy to be done ,</l>
     <l n="46">And doubtless ‘ twill produce a deal of fun .</l>
     <l n="47">‘ Tis our request ( the plot you 'll say is deep ,)</l>
     <l n="48">That you this night with Cloris 's husband sleep</l>
     <l n="49">Some disagreement with her gay gallant</l>
     <l n="50">Requires , that she a night at least should grant ,</l>
     <l n="51">To settle diff'rences ; now we desire ,</l>
     <l n="52">That you 'll to bed with Eurilas retire ,</l>
     <l n="53">There 's not a doubt he 'll think his Cloris near ;</l>
     <l n="54">He never touches her :— so nothing fear ;</l>
     <l n="55">For whether jealousy , or other pains ,</l>
     <l n="56">He constantly from intercourse abstains ,</l>
     <l n="57">Snores through the night , and , if a cap he sees ,</l>
     <l n="58">Believes his wife in bed , and feels at ease .</l>
     <l n="59">We 'll properly equip you as a belle ,</l>
     <l n="60">And I will certainly reward you well .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="61">TO gain but Phillis 's smiles , the Gascon said ,</l>
     <l n="62">He 'd with the very devil go to bed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="63">THE night arrived , our wight the chamber traced ;</l>
     <l n="64">The lights extinguished ; Eurilas , too , placed ;</l>
     <l n="65">The Gascon ‘ gan to tremble in a trice ,</l>
     <l n="66">And soon with terror grew as cold as ice ;</l>
     <l n="67">Durst neither spit nor cough ; still less encroach ;</l>
     <l n="68">And seemed to shrink , least t'other should approach ;</l>
     <l n="69">Crept near the edge ; would scarcely room afford ,</l>
     <l n="70">And could have passed the scabbard of a sword .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="71">OFT in the night his bed-fellow turned round ;</l>
     <l n="72">At length a finger on his nose he found ,</l>
     <l n="73">Which Dorilas exceedingly distressed ;</l>
     <l n="74">But more inquietude was in his breast ,</l>
     <l n="75">For fear the husband amorous should grow ,</l>
     <l n="76">From which incalculable ills might flow .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="77">OUR Gascon ev'ry minute knew alarm ;</l>
     <l n="78">‘ Twas now a leg stretched out , and then an arm ;</l>
     <l n="79">He even thought he felt the husband 's beard ;</l>
     <l n="80">But presently arrived what more he feared .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="81">A BELL , conveniently , was near the bed ,</l>
     <l n="82">Which Eurilas to ring was often led ;</l>
     <l n="83">At this the Gascon swooned , so great his fear ,</l>
     <l n="84">And swore , for ever he 'd renounce his dear .</l>
     <l n="85">But no one coming , Eurilas , once more ,</l>
     <l n="86">Resumed his place , and ‘ gan again to snore .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="87">AT length , before the sun his head had reared ;</l>
     <l n="88">The door was opened , and a torch appeared .</l>
     <l n="89">Misfortune then he fancied full in sight ;</l>
     <l n="90">More pleased he 'd been to rise without a light ,</l>
     <l n="91">And clearly thought ‘ twas over with him now ;</l>
     <l n="92">The flame approached ;— the drops ran o'er his brow ;</l>
     <l n="93">With terror he for pardon humbly prayed :—</l>
     <l n="94">You have it , cried a fair : be not dismayed ;</l>
     <l n="95">‘ Twas Phillis spoke , who Eurilas 's place</l>
     <l n="96">Had filled , throughout the night , with wily grace ,</l>
     <l n="97">And now to Damon and his Cloris flew ,</l>
     <l n="98">With ridicule the Gascon to pursue ;</l>
     <l n="99">Recounted all the terrors and affright ,</l>
     <l n="100">Which Dorilas had felt throughout the night .</l>
     <l n="101">To mortify still more the silly swain ,</l>
     <l n="102">And fill his soul with ev'ry poignant pain ,</l>
     <l n="103">She gave a glimpse of beauties to his view ,</l>
     <l n="104">And from his presence instantly withdrew .</l>
