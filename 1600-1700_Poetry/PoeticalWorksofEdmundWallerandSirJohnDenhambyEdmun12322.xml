     <l n="1">An early plant ! which such a blossom bears ,</l>
     <l n="2">And shows a genius so beyond his years ;</l>
     <l n="3">A judgment ! that could make so fair a choice ;</l>
     <l n="4">So high a subject to employ his voice ;</l>

     <l n="6">The growing greatness of our matchless king !</l>

     <l n="3">Beauty and valour did his short life grace ,</l>
     <l n="4">The grief and glory of his noble race !</l>
     <l n="5">Early abroad he did the world survey ,</l>
     <l n="6">As if he knew he had not long to stay ;</l>
     <l n="7">Saw what great Alexander in the East ,</l>
     <l n="8">And mighty Julius conquer 'd in the West ;</l>
     <l n="9">Then , with a mind as great as theirs , he came</l>
     <l n="10">To find at home occasion for his fame ; 10</l>
     <l n="11">Where dark confusion did the nations hide ,</l>
     <l n="12">And where the juster was the weaker side .</l>
     <l n="13">Two loyal brothers took their sov'reign ' s part ,</l>
     <l n="14">Employ 'd their wealth , their courage , and their art ;</l>
     <l n="15">The elder<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>did whole regiments afford ;</l>
     <l n="16">The younger brought his conduct and his sword .</l>
     <l n="17">Born to command , a leader he begun ,</l>
     <l n="18">And on the rebels lasting honour won .</l>
     <l n="19">The horse , instructed by their general 's worth ,</l>
     <l n="20">Still made the king victorious in the north . 20</l>
     <l n="21">Where Ca'ndish fought , the Royalists prevail 'd ;</l>
     <l n="22">Neither his courage nor his judgment fail 'd .</l>
     <l n="23">The current of his vict'ries found no stop ,</l>
     <l n="24">Till Cromwell came , his party 's chiefest prop .</l>
     <l n="25">Equal success had set these champions high ,</l>
     <l n="26">And both resolved to conquer or to die .</l>
     <l n="27">Virtue with rage , fury with valour strove ;</l>
     <l n="28">But that must fall which is decreed above !</l>
     <l n="29">Cromwell , with odds of number and of fate ,</l>
     <l n="30">Removed this bulwark of the church and state ; 30</l>
     <l n="31">Which the sad issue of the war declared ,</l>
     <l n="32">And made his task , to ruin both , less hard .</l>
     <l n="33">So when the bank , neglected , is o'erthrown ,</l>
     <l n="34">The boundless torrent does the country drown .</l>
     <l n="35">Thus fell the young , the lovely , and the brave ;—</l>
     <l n="36">Strew bays and flowers on his honoured grave !</l>

      <l n="305">Ask of no angel to reveal thy fate ;</l>

      <l n="307">He that invites will not th'invited mock ,</l>
      <l n="308">Opening to all that do in earnest knock .</l>

      <l n="311">This fear , that drives all other fears away ,</l>
      <l n="312">Shall be my song , the morning of our day ;</l>
      <l n="313">Where that fear is , there 's nothing to be fear 'd ;</l>
      <l n="314">It brings from heaven an angel for a guard .</l>
      <l n="315">Tranquillity and peace this fear does give ;</l>
      <l n="316">Hell gapes for those that do without it live .</l>
      <l n="317">It is a beam , which He on man lets fall ,</l>

      <l n="321">For a good cause , the sufferings of man</l>

      <l n="323">Man , since his fall , in no mean station rests ,</l>

      <l n="329">The world 's great conqu'ror<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>would his point pursue ,</l>

      <l n="339">All their delight is while their wish comes in ;</l>
      <l n="340">Sad when it stops , as there had nothing been . 40</l>
      <l n="341">‘ Tis strange men should neglect their present store ,</l>
      <l n="342">And take no joy but in pursuing more ;</l>
      <l n="343">No ! though arrived at all the world can aim ;</l>
      <l n="344">This is the mark and glory of our frame ,</l>
      <l n="345">A soul capacious of the Deity ,</l>
      <l n="346">Nothing but He that made can satisfy .</l>
      <l n="347">A thousand worlds , if we with Him compare , 47</l>
      <l n="348">Less than so many drops of water are .</l>
      <l n="349">Men take no pleasure but in new designs ;</l>
      <l n="350">And what they hope for , what they have outshines .</l>
      <l n="351">Our sheep and oxen seem no more to crave ,</l>
      <l n="352">With full content feeding on what they have ;</l>
      <l n="353">Vex not themselves for an increase of store ,</l>
      <l n="354">But think to-morrow we shall give them more .</l>
      <l n="355">What we from day to day receive from Heaven ,</l>
      <l n="356">They do from us expect it should be given .</l>
      <l n="357">We made them not , yet they on us rely ,</l>
      <l n="358">More than vain men upon the Deity ;</l>
      <l n="359">More beasts than they ! that will not understand</l>
      <l n="360">That we are fed from His immediate hand . 60</l>
      <l n="361">Man , that in Him has being , moves , and lives ,</l>
      <l n="362">What can he have , or use , but what He gives ?</l>

   <p>END OF WALLER 'S POEMS .</p>
   <p>THE POETICAL WORKS</p>
   <p>OF</p>
   <p>SIR JOHN DENHAM .</p>
   <p>LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM .</p>
   <p>Next to those poets who have exerted an influence on the matter , should be ranked those who have improved the manner , of our song . So that thus the same list may include the names of a Chaucer and a Waller , of a Milton and a Denham — the more as we suspect none but a true poet can materially improve even a poetical mode , can contrive even a new stirrup to Pegasus , or even to retune the awful organ of Pythia . Neither Denham nor Waller were great poets ; but they have produced lines and verses so good , and have , besides , exerted an influence so considerable on modern versification , and the style of poetical utterance , that they are entitled to a highly respectable place amidst the sons of British song .</p>
   <p>Sir John Denham , although thoroughly English both in descent and in complexion of mind , was born in Dublin in 1615 . His father , whose name also was Sir John ( of Little Horseley , in Essex ) , was , at the time of our poet 's birth , the Chief Baron of Exchequer in Ireland . His mother was Eleanor More , daughter of Sir Garret More , Baron of Mellefont . Two years after the son 's birth , the father , being made an English Baron of Exchequer , returned to his native country , and educated young John in London . Thence , at the age of sixteen , he went to study at Oxford , where he became celebrated rather for dissipation than diligence . He was , although a youth of imaginative temperament , excessively fond of gambling ; and it was said of him , that he was more given to “ dreams and dice than to study . ” His future eminence might be foreseen by some of his friends ; but , in general , men looked on him rather as an idle and misled youth of fortune , than as a genius . Three years after , he removed to Lincoln 's Inn , where he continued occasionally to gamble , and was sometimes punished for his pains , being plundered by more skilful or unscrupulous gamesters , but did not forget his studies . His conscience , on one occasion , aroused by a rebuke from a friend , awoke ; and , to confirm the resolutions which it forced upon him , he wrote and published an “ Essay on Gaming . ” In this respect he resembles Sir Richard Steele when a young soldier , who , in order to cure himself of his dissipations , wrote and published “ The Christian Hero ” — his object being , by drawing the picture of a character exactly opposite to his own , to commit himself irrevocably to virtue , and to break down all the bridges between him and a return to vice . It is , alas ! notorious , that Steele 's holiness turned out only to be a FIT , of not much longer duration than a morning headache , and that the “ Christian Hero ” remains not as a model to which its author 's conduct was ever conformed , but as a severe , self-written satire on his whole career . And so with Denham . For some time he forsook the gambling-table , and applied his attention partly to law , and partly to poetry , translating , in 1636 , the “ Second Book of the Aeneid ; ” but when his father died , two years afterwards , and left him some thousands , he rushed again to the dice-box , and melted them as rapidly as the wind melts the snow of spring .</p>
   <p>“ In 1642 he broke out , ” as Waller remarks of him , “ like the Irish Rebellion , threescore thousand strong , when nobody was aware , or in the least suspected it , ” in the play of “ Sophy ; ” and , sooth to say , like that rebellion , his outbreak is lawless and irregular , as well as strong ; as in that rebellion , too , there is a rather needless expenditure of blood . What Byron says of Dr. Polidori 's tragedy , is nearly true of “ Sophy ” —</p>
   <p>“ All stab , and everybody dies . ”</p>
   <p>Nothing can be more horrible and disgusting than many of the incidents . A father suspecting and plotting against a dear and noble son ; a son deprived of sight by the command of a father , and meditating in his rage and revenge the murder of his own favourite daughter , because she is beloved by his father ; and the deaths of both son and father by poison , administered through means of a courtier who has betrayed both . Such are the main hinges on which the plot of the piece turns . The versification , too , is exceedingly unequal ; sometimes swelling into rather full and splendid blank verse , and anon shrinking up into lines stunted and shrivelled , like boughs either touched by frost , or lopped by the axe of the woodman . Still there are in “ Sophy ” a force of style , a maturity of mind , an energy of declamation , and , here and there , an appreciation of Shakspeare — shewn in a generous though hopeless rivalry of his manner — which account for the reception it at first met with , and seem to have excited in Denham 's contemporaries expectations which were never fulfilled . This uprise , as well as that of the Irish ( which took place the year before it ) , turned out , on the whole , abortive . And yet what fine lines and sentiments are the following , culled from “ Sophy ” almost ad aperturam libri :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Fear and guilt</l>
     <l n="2">Are the same thing , and when our actions are not ,</l>
     <l n="3">Our fears are crimes .</l>
     <l n="4">The east and west</l>
     <l n="5">Upon the globe , a mathematic point</l>
     <l n="6">Only divides ; thus happiness and misery ,</l>
     <l n="7">And all extremes , are still contiguous .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">More gallant actions have been lost , for want of being</l>
     <l n="9">Completely wicked , than have been performed</l>
     <l n="10">By being exactly virtuous . ‘ Tis hard to be</l>
     <l n="11">Exact in good , or excellent in ill ;</l>
     <l n="12">Our will wants power , or else our power wants skill .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">When in the midst of fears we are surprised</l>
     <l n="14">With unexpected happiness , the first</l>
     <l n="15">Degrees of joy are mere astonishment .</l>
     <l n="16">Fear , the shadow</l>
     <l n="17">Of danger , like the shadow of our bodies ,</l>
     <l n="18">Is greater , then , when that which is the cause</l>
     <l n="19">Is farthest off . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="20">The blinded prince 's soliloquy , in the first scene of the fifth act , is</l>
     <l n="21">worthy of Shakspeare . We must quote the following lines :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="22">“ Reason , my soul 's eye , still sees</l>
     <l n="23">Clearly , and clearer for the want of eyes ,</l>
     <l n="24">For gazing through the windows of the body</l>
     <l n="25">It met such several , such distracting objects ;</l>
     <l n="26">But now confined within itself it sees</l>
     <l n="27">A strange and unknown world , and there discovers</l>
     <l n="28">Torrents of anger , mountains of ambition ,</l>
     <l n="29">Gulfs of desire , and towers of hope , large giants ,</l>
     <l n="30">Monsters and savage beasts ; to vanquish these</l>
     <l n="31">Will be a braver conquest , than the old</l>
     <l n="32">Or the new world . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Shortly after the appearance of “ Sophy , ” he was admitted , by the form then usual , Sheriff of Surrey , and appointed governor of Farnham Castle for the king ; this important post , however , he soon resigned , and retreated to Oxford , where , in 1643 , he published his poem entitled “ Cooper 's Hill . ” This instantly became popular , and many who might have seen in “ Sophy ” greater powers than were disclosed in this new effort , envied its fame , and gave out that he had bought it of a vicar for forty pounds . For this there was , of course , no proof , and it is only worth mentioning because it is one of a large class of cases , in which envious mediocrity , or crushed dulness , or jealous rivalry , has sought to snatch hard-won laurels from the brow of genius . As if these laurels were so smooth , and so soothing , as always to invite ambition , or as if they were so flexible as to suit every brow ! As if FIRE lurked not sometimes in their leaves , and as if there were not , besides , a nobler jealousy in the public mind ready to watch and to avenge their misappropriation . Certain it is that not only , as Johnson remarks , was the attempt made to rob Addison of “ Cato , ” and Pope of the “ Essay of Criticism , ” but it has a hundred times taken place in the history of poetry . Rolt , as we saw in our late life of Akenside , tried to snatch the honour of writing “ The Pleasures of Imagination ” from its author . Lauder accused Milton of plundering the Italians wholesale . Scott 's early novels have only the other day been most absurdly claimed for his brother Thomas . And notwithstanding Shakspeare 's well-known lines over his sepulchre at Stratford —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Bless 'd be the man who spares these stones ,</l>
     <l n="2">But curs 'd be he who moves my bones ” —</l>
   </lg>
   <p>a worse outrage has been recently committed on his memory , than were his dust , like Wickliffe 's , tossed out of his tomb into the Avon — his plays have been , with as much stupidity as malice , attributed to Lord Bacon ! Homer , too , has been found out to be a myth ; and we know not if even Dante 's originality has altogether passed unquestioned in this age of disbelief and downpulling ; although what brow , save that thunder-scathed pile , could wear those scorched laurels , and who but the “ man who had been in hell ” could have written the “ Inferno ? ” Worst of all , a class of writers have of late sought to prove that there is no such thing as originality — that genius means just dexterous borrowing-that the “ Appropriation Clause ” is of divine right — and have certainly proved themselves true to their own principles .</p>
   <p>In 1647 , circumstances brought our poet more closely in connexion with the royal family , and on one occasion he carried a message from the Queen to King Charles , then in prison . He subsequently conducted , with great success , the King 's correspondence ; and in April 1648 he conveyed the young Duke of York ( afterwards James II . ) from London to France , and delivered him to the charge of the Queen and the Prince of Wales . He had , ere leaving Britain , written a translation of Cato-Major on Old Age . While in France , attending on the exiled prince , he wrote a number of poetical pieces at his master 's desire ; among others , a song in honour of an embassy to Poland , which he and Lord Crofts undertook for Charles II ., and during which they are said to have collected £ 10 , 000 for the royal cause from the Scotchmen who then abounded in that country as travelling merchants or pedlars . Meanwhile his political misdemeanours were punished by the Parliament confiscating the remnant of his estate . In 1652 , he returned to England penniless , and was supported by the Earl of Pembroke . After the Restoration , Charles , more mindful of him than of many of his friends and the partners of his exile , bestowed on Denham the Surveyorship of the King 's Buildings and the Order of the Bath . The situation of Surveyor , even in his careless and improvident hands , turned out a lucrative one ; for it is said that he cleared by it no less than £ 7000 . Of his first wife , we hear little or nothing ; but about this time , flushed as he was with prosperity , and the popularity of the writings he continued to produce , he contracted a second marriage , which was so far from happy that its consequences led to a fit of temporary derangement . Butler , then a disappointed and exacerbated man , was malignant enough to lampoon him for lunacy — an act which , Dr. Johnson well remarks , “ no provocation could excuse . ” It was , in Fuller 's fine old quaint language , “ breaking one whom God had bowed before . ” Our readers will find Butler 's squib in our edition of that poet , vol . ii . p. 200 , under the title of “ A Panegyrick on Sir John Denham 's Recovery from his Madness . ” It is a piece quite unworthy of Butler 's powers , and its sting lies principally in charging Denham with plagiarising “ Cooper 's Hill ” and “ Sophy , ” with gambling , and with overreaching the King as Surveyor of the Public Buildings , and with an overbearing and quarrelsome temper — but it contains no allusion to his domestic infelicity . Some have hinted that the cause of his insanity lay in jealousy — that Denham suspected his wife to be too intimate with the Duke of York — that he poisoned her , and maddened in remorse . Whatever the cause , the distemper was not of long continuance . He recovered in time to write some verses on the death of Cowley , which took place in 1667 ; but in the next year he himself expired , and was buried by the side of his friend in Westminster Abbey , not very far from Chaucer and Spencer . His funeral took place on the 19th of March 1668 . He had attained the age of fifty-three .</p>
   <p>This is all we can definitely state of the history of Sir John Denham , and certainly the light it casts on his character is neither very plentiful nor very pleasing . A gambler in his early days , he became a political intriguer , an unhappy husband , a maniac , and died in the prime of life . It need only further be recorded of him , that , according to some accounts , he first discovered the merits of Milton 's “ Paradise Lost , ” and went about with the book new from the press in his hands , shewing it to everybody , and exclaiming , “ This beats us all , and the ancients too ! ” If this story be true , it says as much for his heart as his head for the generous disposition which made him praise a political adversary , as for the critical taste which discerned at a glance the value of the world 's greatest poem . On the whole , however , Denham as a man stands on the same general level with the Cavalier wits in the days of Charles . If he did not rise so high as Cowley , he did not sink so low as Rochester , or even as Butler .</p>
   <p>We may now regret , both that he did not live better , and that he did not write more . He had unquestionably in him greater powers than he ever expressed in his works . These are few , fragmentary , and unequal ; but , nevertheless , must be reckoned productions of no ordinary merit . They discover a great deal of the body , and not a little of the soul , of poetry . In the passages we cited from “ Sophy , ” and throughout the whole of that play , there is a vigorous and profound vein of reflection , as well as of imagination . Like Shakspeare , although on a scale very much inferior , he carries on a constant stream of subtle reflection amidst all the windings of his story ; and even the most critical points of the drama are studded with pearls . Coleridge speaks of himself , or some one else , as wishing to live “ collaterally , or aside , to the onward progress of society ; ” and thus , in the drama , there should ever be , as it were , a projection , or alias , of the author standing collaterally , or aside , to the bustling incidents and whirling passions , and calmly adding the commentary of wisdom , as they rush impetuously on . Such essentially was the chorus of the ancient Greek play ; and a similar end is answered in Shakspeare by the subtle asides , the glancing bye-lights , which his wondrous intellect interposes amidst the rapid play of his fancy , the exuberance of his wit , and the crowded incident and interchange of passion created by his genius . Some have maintained that the philosophy of a drama should be chiefly confined to the conceptions of the characters , the development of the plot , and the management of the dialogue — that all the reflection should be molten into the mass of the play , and none of it embossed on the surface ; but certainly neither Shakspeare 's , nor Schiller 's , nor Goethe 's dramas answer to this ideal — all of them , besides the philosophy , so to speak , afoot in the progress of the story , contain a great deal standing still , quietly lurking in nooks and corners , and yet exerting a powerful influence on the ultimate effect and explanation of the whole . And so , according to its own proportions , it is with Denham 's “ Sophy . ” Indeed , as we have above hinted , its power lies more in these interesting individual beauties than in its general structure .</p>
   <p>“ Cooper 's Hill , ” next to “ Sophy , ” is undoubtedly his best production . Dr. Johnson calls it the first English specimen of local poetry — i. e ., of poetry in which a special scene is , through the embellishments of traditionary recollection , moral reflections , and the power of association generally , uplifted into a poetical light . This has been done afterwards by Garth , in his “ Claremont ; ” Pope , in his “ Windsor Forest ; ” Dyer , in his “ Gronger-hill , ” and a hundred other instances . The great danger in this class of poems , is lest imported sentiment and historical reminiscence should overpower the living lineaments , and all but blot out the memory of the actual landscape . And so it is to some extent in “ Cooper 's Hill , ” the scene beheld from which is speedily lost in a torrent of political reflection and moralising . The well-known lines on the Thames are rhetorical and forcible , but not , we think , highly poetical :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Oh , could I flow like thee , and make thy stream</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">The poem closes with another river-picture , which some will admire :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">“ When a calm river , raised with sudden rains</l>
     <l n="7">Or snows dissolved , o'erflows the adjoining plains ,</l>
     <l n="8">The husbandmen , with high-raised banks , secure</l>
     <l n="9">Their greedy hopes , and this he can endure ;</l>
     <l n="10">But , if with bays and dams they strive to force</l>
     <l n="11">His channel to a new or narrow course ,</l>
     <l n="12">No longer then — within his banks he dwells ,</l>
     <l n="13">First to a torrent , then a deluge swells ,</l>
     <l n="14">Stronger and fiercer by restraint he roars ,</l>
     <l n="15">And knows no bound , but makes his power his shores . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="16">Again , he says of Thames :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">“ Thames , the most loved of all the ocean 's sons</l>
     <l n="18">By his old sire , to his embraces runs ,</l>
     <l n="19">Hasting to pay his tribute to the sea ,</l>
     <l n="20">Like mortal life to meet eternity .</l>
     <l n="21">Though with those streams he no resemblance hold</l>
     <l n="22">Whose foam is amber and their gravel gold .</l>
     <l n="23">His genuine and less guilty wealth t'explore ,</l>
     <l n="24">Search not his bottom , but survey his shore . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Yet , though fond of , and great in , describing rivers , he is not , after all , the “ river-god ” of poetry . Professor Wilson speaks with a far deeper voice :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Down falls the drawbridge with a thund'ring shock ,</l>
     <l n="2">And , in an instant , ere the eye can know ,</l>
     <l n="3">Binds the stern castle to the opposing rock ,</l>
     <l n="4">And hangs in calmness o'er the flood below ;</l>
     <l n="5">A raging flood , that , born among the hills ,</l>
     <l n="6">Flows dancing on through many a nameless glen ,</l>
     <l n="7">Till , join 'd by all his tributary rills</l>
     <l n="8">From lake and tarn , from marsh and from fen ,</l>
     <l n="9">He leaves his empire with a kingly glee ,</l>
     <l n="10">And fiercely bids retire the billows of the sea ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Different poets are made to write on different rivers as well as on different mountains . Denham paints well the calm majestic Thames ; Wilson , the rapid Spey ; Scott , the immemorial and historic Forth ; Burns , the wild lonely Lugar and the Doon ; and Thomas Aird ( see his exquisitely beautiful “ River ” ) , the pastoral Cluden . But the poet of the St. Lawrence , with Niagara flinging itself over its crag like a mad ocean — of the Ganges or the Orellana — has yet to be born , or at least has yet to bring forth his conceptions of such a stupendous object in poetry .</p>
   <p>In “ Cooper 's Hill ” we find well , if not fully exhibited , what were Denham 's leading qualities — not high imagination or a fertile fancy , although in neither of these was he conspicuously deficient , but manly strength of thought and clearness of language . There are in him no quaintnesses , no crotchets , no conceits , and no involutions or affectations — all is transparent , masculine , and energetic . It is in these respects that he became a model to Dryden and Pope , and may even still be read with advantage for at least his style , which is</p>
   <p>“ Strong without rage , without o'erflowing full . ”</p>
   <p>His translations we have included , not for their surpassing merit , but because , in the first place , there is little of our author extant , and we are happy to reprint every scrap of him we can find , and because again he , according to Dr. Johnson , was “ one of the first that understood the necessity of emancipating translation from the drudgery of counting lines and interpreting single words . ” There has , indeed , been recently a reaction , attended in some cases with brilliant success — as in Bulwer 's “ Ballads of Schiller ” — in favour of the literal and lineal method ; but since such popular pieces as Dryden 's “ Virgil ” and Pope 's “ Homer ” have been written on Denham 's plan , it is interesting to preserve the model , however rude , which they avowedly had in their eye .</p>
   <p>His smaller pieces are not remarkable , unless we except his vigorous lines “ On the Earl of Stafford 's Trial and Death , ” containing such noble sentiments as these —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Such was his force of eloquence , to make</l>
     <l n="2">The hearers more concern 'd than he that spake ,</l>
     <l n="3">Each seem 'd to act that part he came to see ,</l>
     <l n="4">And none was more a looker-on than he ;</l>
     <l n="5">So did he move our passions , some were known</l>
     <l n="6">To wish for the defence , the crime their own .</l>
     <l n="7">Now private pity strove with public hate ,</l>
     <l n="8">Reason with rage , and eloquence with fate . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Nor let us forget his verses on “ Cowley 's Death , ” which , although unequal , and in their praise exaggerated , yet are in parts exceedingly felicitous , as for instance , in the lines to which Macaulay , in his “ Milton , ” refers :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ To him no author was unknown ,</l>
     <l n="2">Yet what he wrote was all his own ;</l>
     <l n="3">He melted not the ancient gold ,</l>
     <l n="4">Nor with Ben Jonson did make bold</l>
     <l n="5">To plunder all the Roman stores</l>
     <l n="6">Of poets and of orators ;</l>
     <l n="7">Horace 's wit and Virgil 's state</l>
     <l n="8">He did not steal , but emulate !</l>
     <l n="9">And when he would like them appear ,</l>
     <l n="10">Their garb , but not their clothes , did wear . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Such is true criticism , which , in our judgment , means clear , sharp , discriminating judgment expressed in the language and with the feelings of poetry .</p>

     <l n="1">Sure there are poets which did never dream</l>

     <l n="221">While winds and storms his lofty forehead beat :</l>
     <l n="222">The common fate of all that 's high or great .</l>
     <l n="223">Low at his foot a spacious plain is placed ,</l>
     <l n="224">Between the mountain and the stream embraced ,</l>
     <l n="225">Which shade and shelter from the hill derives ,</l>
     <l n="226">While the kind river wealth and beauty gives ,</l>
     <l n="227">And in the mixture of all these appears</l>
     <l n="228">Variety , which all the rest endears .</l>
     <l n="229">This scene had some bold Greek or British bard</l>
     <l n="230">Beheld of old , what stories had we heard 230</l>
     <l n="231">Of fairies , satyrs , and the nymphs their dames ,</l>
     <l n="232">Their feasts , their revels , and their am'rous flames ?</l>
     <l n="233">‘ Tis still the same , although their airy shape</l>
     <l n="234">All but a quick poetic sight escape .</l>
     <l n="235">There Faunus and Sylvanus keep their courts ,</l>
     <l n="236">And thither all the horned host resorts</l>
     <l n="237">To graze the ranker mead ; that noble herd</l>
     <l n="238">On whose sublime and shady fronts is rear 'd</l>
     <l n="239">Nature 's great masterpiece ; to show how soon ,</l>
     <l n="240">Great things are made , but sooner are undone . 240</l>
     <l n="241">Here have I seen the King , when great affairs</l>
     <l n="242">Gave leave to slacken , and unbend his cares ,</l>
     <l n="243">Attended to the chase by all the flower</l>
     <l n="244">Of youth whose hopes a nobler prey devour :</l>
     <l n="245">Pleasure with praise and danger they would buy ,</l>
     <l n="246">And wish a foe that would not only fly .</l>
     <l n="247">The stag now conscious of his fatal growth ,</l>
     <l n="248">At once indulgent to his fear and sloth ,</l>
     <l n="249">To some dark covert his retreat had made ,</l>
     <l n="250">Where nor man 's eye , nor heaven 's should invade 250</l>
     <l n="251">His soft repose ; when th'unexpected sound</l>
     <l n="252">Of dogs , and men , his wakeful ears does wound .</l>
     <l n="253">Roused with the noise , he scarce believes his ear ,</l>
     <l n="254">Willing to think th'illusions of his fear</l>
     <l n="255">Had given this false alarm , but straight his view</l>
     <l n="256">Confirms that more than all he fears is true .</l>
     <l n="257">Betray 'd in all his strengths , the wood beset ;</l>
     <l n="258">All instruments , all arts of ruin met ;</l>
     <l n="259">He calls to mind his strength and then his speed ,</l>
     <l n="260">His winged heels , and then his armed head ; 260</l>
     <l n="261">With these t'avoid , with that his fate to meet :</l>
     <l n="262">But fear prevails , and bids him trust his feet .</l>
     <l n="263">So fast he flies , that his reviewing eye</l>
     <l n="264">Has lost the chasers , and his ear the cry ;</l>
     <l n="265">Exulting , till he finds their nobler sense</l>
     <l n="266">Their disproportion 'd speed doth recompense ;</l>
     <l n="267">Then curses his conspiring feet , whose scent</l>
     <l n="268">Betrays that safety which their swiftness lent ;</l>
     <l n="269">Then tries his friends ; among the baser herd ,</l>
     <l n="270">Where he so lately was obey 'd and fear 'd , 270</l>
     <l n="271">His safety seeks ; the herd , unkindly wise ,</l>
     <l n="272">Or chases him from thence , or from him flies ;</l>
     <l n="273">Like a declining statesman , left forlorn</l>
     <l n="274">To his friends ’ pity , and pursuers ’ scorn ,</l>
     <l n="275">With shame remembers , while himself was one</l>
     <l n="276">Of the same herd , himself the same had done .</l>
     <l n="277">Thence to the coverts and the conscious groves ,</l>
     <l n="278">The scenes of his past triumphs and his loves ;</l>
     <l n="279">Sadly surveying where he ranged alone</l>
     <l n="280">Prince of the soil , and all the herd his own , 280</l>
     <l n="281">And like a bold knight-errant did proclaim .</l>
     <l n="282">Combat to all , and bore away the dame ,</l>
     <l n="283">And taught the woods to echo to the stream</l>
     <l n="284">His dreadful challenge , and his clashing beam ;</l>
     <l n="285">Yet faintly now declines the fatal strife ;</l>
     <l n="286">So much his love was dearer than his life .</l>
     <l n="287">Now every leaf , and every moving breath</l>
     <l n="288">Presents a foe , and every foe a death .</l>
     <l n="289">Wearied , forsaken , and pursued , at last</l>
     <l n="290">All safety in despair of safety placed , 290</l>
     <l n="291">Courage he thence resumes , resolved to bear</l>
     <l n="292">All their assaults , since ‘ tis in vain to fear .</l>
     <l n="293">And now , too late , he wishes for the fight</l>
     <l n="294">That strength he wasted in ignoble flight :</l>
     <l n="295">But when he sees the eager chase renew 'd ,</l>
     <l n="296">Himself by dogs , the dogs by men pursued ,</l>
     <l n="297">He straight revokes his bold resolve , and more</l>
     <l n="298">Repents his courage than his fear before ;</l>
     <l n="299">Finds that uncertain ways unsafest are ,</l>
     <l n="300">And doubt a greater mischief than despair . 300</l>
     <l n="301">Then to the stream , when neither friends , nor force ,</l>
     <l n="302">Nor speed , nor art , avail , he shapes his course ;</l>
     <l n="303">Thinks not their rage so desperate to assay</l>
     <l n="304">An element more merciless than they .</l>
     <l n="305">But fearless they pursue , nor can the flood</l>
     <l n="306">Quench their dire thirst ; alas ! they thirst for blood .</l>
     <l n="307">So t'wards a ship the oar-finn 'd galleys ply ,</l>
     <l n="308">Which , wanting sea to ride , or wind to fly ,</l>
     <l n="309">Stands but to fall revenged on those that dare</l>
     <l n="310">Tempt the last fury of extreme despair . 310</l>
     <l n="311">So fares the stag , among th'enraged hounds ,</l>
     <l n="312">Repels their force , and wounds returns for wounds ;</l>
     <l n="313">And as a hero , whom his baser foes</l>
     <l n="314">In troops surround , now these assails , now those ,</l>
     <l n="315">Though prodigal of life , disdains to die</l>
     <l n="316">By common hands ; but if he can descry</l>
     <l n="317">Some nobler foe approach , to him he calls ,</l>
     <l n="318">And begs his fate , and then contented falls .</l>
     <l n="319">So when the king a mortal shaft lets fly 319</l>
     <l n="320">From his unerring hand , then glad to die ,</l>
     <l n="321">Proud of the wound , to it resigns his blood ,</l>
     <l n="322">And stains the crystal with a purple flood .</l>
     <l n="323">This a more innocent , and happy chase ,</l>
     <l n="324">Than when of old , but in the selfsame place ,</l>
     <l n="325">Fair Liberty pursued ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>and meant a prey</l>
     <l n="326">To lawless power , here turn 'd , and stood at bay ;</l>
     <l n="327">When in that remedy all hope was placed</l>
     <l n="328">Which was , or should have been at least , the last .</l>
     <l n="329">Here was that charter seal 'd , wherein the crown</l>
     <l n="330">All marks of arbitrary power lays down : 330</l>
     <l n="331">Tyrant and slave , those names of hate and fear ,</l>
     <l n="332">The happier style of king and subject bear :</l>
     <l n="333">Happy , when both to the same centre move ,</l>
     <l n="334">When kings give liberty , and subjects love .</l>
     <l n="335">Therefore not long in force this charter stood ;</l>
     <l n="336">Wanting that seal , it must be seal 'd in blood .</l>
     <l n="337">The subjects arm 'd , the more their princes gave ,</l>
     <l n="338">Th ’ advantage only took the more to crave ;</l>
     <l n="339">Till kings by giving , give themselves away ,</l>
     <l n="340">And e'en that power , that should deny , betray . 340</l>
     <l n="341">‘ Who gives constrain 'd , but his own fear reviles ,</l>
     <l n="342">Not thank 'd , but scorn 'd ; nor are they gifts , but spoils . ’</l>
     <l n="343">Thus kings , by grasping more than they could hold ,</l>
     <l n="344">First made their subjects , by oppression , bold :</l>
     <l n="345">And popular sway , by forcing kings to give</l>
     <l n="346">More than was fit for subjects to receive ,</l>
     <l n="347">Ran to the same extremes ; and one excess</l>
     <l n="348">Made both , by striving to be greater , less .</l>
     <l n="349">When a calm river , raised with sudden rains ,</l>
     <l n="350">Or snows dissolved , o'erflows th'adjoining plains , 350</l>
     <l n="351">The husbandmen with high raised banks secure</l>
     <l n="352">Their greedy hopes , and this he can endure ;</l>
     <l n="353">But if with bays and dams they strive to force</l>
     <l n="354">His channel to a new , or narrow course ;</l>
     <l n="355">No longer then within his banks he dwells ,</l>
     <l n="356">First to a torrent , then a deluge , swells ;</l>
     <l n="357">Stronger and fiercer by restraint he roars ,</l>
     <l n="358">And knows no bound , but makes his power his shores .</l>

    <head>THE DESTRUCTION OF TROY .</head>
     <l n="1">AN ESSAY ON THE SECOND BOOK OF VIRGIL 'S AENEIS ,</l>
     <l n="2">WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1636 .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>The first book speaks of Aeneas 's voyage by sea , and how , being cast by tempest upon the coast of Carthage , he was received by Queen Dido , who , after the feast , desires him to make the relation of the destruction of Troy ; which is the argument of this book .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">While all with silence and attention wait ,</l>
     <l n="2">Thus speaks Aeneas from the bed of state :—</l>
     <l n="3">Madam , when you command us to review</l>
     <l n="4">Our fate , you make our old wounds bleed anew ,</l>
     <l n="5">And all those sorrows to my sense restore ,</l>
     <l n="6">Whereof none saw so much , none suffer 'd more .</l>
     <l n="7">Not the most cruel of our conqu'ring foes</l>
     <l n="8">So unconcern'dly can relate our woes ,</l>
     <l n="9">As not to lend a tear ; then how can I</l>
     <l n="10">Repress the horror of my thoughts , which fly 10</l>
     <l n="11">The sad remembrance ? Now th'expiring night</l>
     <l n="12">And the declining stars to rest invite ;</l>
     <l n="13">Yet since ‘ tis your command , what you so well</l>
     <l n="14">Are pleased to hear , I cannot grieve to tell .</l>
     <l n="15">By fate repell 'd and with repulses tired ,</l>
     <l n="16">The Greeks , so many lives and years expired ,</l>
     <l n="17">A fabric like a moving mountain frame , 17</l>
     <l n="18">Pretending vows for their return ; this Fame</l>
     <l n="19">Divulges ; then within the beast 's vast womb</l>
     <l n="20">The choice and flower of all their troops entomb ;</l>
     <l n="21">In view the isle of Tenedos , once high ,</l>
     <l n="22">In fame and wealth , while Troy remain 'd , doth lie ;</l>
     <l n="23">( Now but an unsecure and open bay )</l>
     <l n="24">Thither by stealth the Greeks their fleet convey .</l>
     <l n="25">We gave them gone ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>and to Mycenæ sail 'd ,</l>
     <l n="26">And Troy reviv 'd , her mourning face unveil 'd ;</l>
     <l n="27">All through th'unguarded gates with joy resort</l>
     <l n="28">To see the slighted camp , the vacant port ;</l>
     <l n="29">Here lay Ulysses , there Achilles ; here</l>
     <l n="30">The battles join 'd ; the Grecian fleet rode there ; 30</l>
     <l n="31">But the vast pile th'amazèd vulgar views ,</l>
     <l n="32">Till they their reason in their wonder lose .</l>
     <l n="33">And first Thymoetes moves ( urged by the power</l>
     <l n="34">Of fate , or fraud ) to place it in the tower ;</l>
     <l n="35">But Capys and the graver sort thought fit</l>
     <l n="36">The Greeks ’ suspected present to commit</l>
     <l n="37">To seas or flames , at least to search and bore</l>
     <l n="38">The sides , and what that space contains , t'explore .</l>
     <l n="39">Th ’ uncertain multitude with both engaged ,</l>
     <l n="40">Divided stands , till from the tower , enraged 40</l>
     <l n="41">Laocoon ran , whom all the crowd attends ,</l>
     <l n="42">Crying , ‘ What desp'rate frenzy 's this , O friends !</l>
     <l n="43">To think them gone ? Judge rather their retreat</l>
     <l n="44">But a design ; their gifts but a deceit ;</l>
     <l n="45">For our destruction ‘ twas contrived no doubt ,</l>
     <l n="46">Or from within by fraud , or from without</l>
     <l n="47">By force . Yet know ye not Ulysses ’ shifts ?</l>
     <l n="48">Their swords less danger carry than their gifts . ’</l>
     <l n="49">( This said ) against the horse 's side his spear 49</l>
     <l n="50">He throws , which trembles with enclosèd fear ,</l>
     <l n="51">Whilst from the hollows of his womb proceed</l>
     <l n="52">Groans , not his own ; and had not Fate decreed</l>
     <l n="53">Our ruin , we had fill 'd with Grecian blood</l>
     <l n="54">The place ; then Troy and Priam 's throne had stood .</l>
     <l n="55">Meanwhile a fetter 'd pris'ner to the king</l>
     <l n="56">With joyful shouts the Dardan shepherds bring ,</l>
     <l n="57">Who to betray us did himself betray ,</l>
     <l n="58">At once the taker , and at once the prey ;</l>
     <l n="59">Firmly prepared , of one event secured ,</l>
     <l n="60">Or of his death or his design assured . 60</l>
     <l n="61">The Trojan youth about the captive flock ,</l>
     <l n="62">To wonder , or to pity , or to mock .</l>
     <l n="63">Now hear the Grecian fraud , and from this one</l>
     <l n="64">Conjecture all the rest .</l>
     <l n="65">Disarm 'd , disorder 'd , casting round his eyes</l>
     <l n="66">On all the troops that guarded him , he cries ,</l>
     <l n="67">‘ What land , what sea , for me what fate attends ?</l>
     <l n="68">Caught by my foes , condemned by my friends ,</l>
     <l n="69">Incensèd Troy a wretched captive seeks</l>
     <l n="70">To sacrifice ; a fugitive the Greeks . ’ — 70</l>
     <l n="71">To pity this complaint our former rage</l>
     <l n="72">Converts ; we now inquire his parentage ;</l>
     <l n="73">What of their counsels or affairs he knew</l>
     <l n="74">Then fearless he replies , ‘ Great king ! to you</l>
     <l n="75">All truth I shall relate : nor first can I</l>
     <l n="76">Myself to be of Grecian birth deny ;</l>
     <l n="77">And though my outward state misfortune hath</l>
     <l n="78">Depress 'd thus low , it cannot reach my faith .</l>
     <l n="79">You may by chance have heard the famous name</l>
     <l n="80">Of Palamede , who from old Belus came , 80</l>
     <l n="81">Whom , but for voting peace , the Greeks pursue ,</l>
     <l n="82">Accus 'd unjustly , then unjustly slew ,</l>
     <l n="83">Yet mourn 'd his death . My father was his friend ,</l>
     <l n="84">And me to his commands did recommend ,</l>
     <l n="85">While laws and councils did his throne support ;</l>
     <l n="86">I but a youth , yet some esteem and port</l>
     <l n="87">We then did bear , till by Ulysses ’ craft</l>
     <l n="88">( Things known I speak ) he was of life bereft :</l>
     <l n="89">Since , in dark sorrow I my days did spend , 90</l>
     <l n="90">Till now , disdaining his unworthy end ,</l>
     <l n="91">I could not silence my complaints , but vow 'd</l>
     <l n="92">Revenge , if ever fate or chance allow 'd</l>
     <l n="93">My wish 'd return to Greece ; from hence his hate ,</l>
     <l n="94">From thence my crimes , and all my ills bear date :</l>
     <l n="95">Old guilt fresh malice gives ; the people 's ears</l>
     <l n="96">He fills with rumours , and their hearts with fears ,</l>
     <l n="97">And then the prophet to his party drew .</l>
     <l n="98">But why do I those thankless truths pursue ,</l>
     <l n="99">Or why defer your rage ? on me , for all</l>
     <l n="100">The Greeks , let your revenging fury fall . 100</l>
     <l n="101">Ulysses this , th'Atridæ this desire</l>
     <l n="102">At any rate . ’ — We straight are set on fire</l>
     <l n="103">( Unpractised in such myst'ries ) to inquire</l>
     <l n="104">The manner and the cause : which thus he told ,</l>
     <l n="105">With gestures humble , as his tale was bold .</l>
     <l n="106">‘ Oft have the Greeks ( the siege detesting ) tired</l>
     <l n="107">With tedious war , a stolen retreat desired ,</l>
     <l n="108">And would to Heaven they 'd gone ! but still dismay 'd</l>
     <l n="109">By seas or skies , unwillingly they stay 'd .</l>
     <l n="110">Chiefly when this stupendous pile was raised , 110</l>
     <l n="111">Strange noises filled the air ; we , all amazed ,</l>
     <l n="112">Despatch Eurypylus t'inquire our fates ,</l>
     <l n="113">Who thus the sentence of the gods relates :</l>
     <l n="114">“ A virgin 's slaughter did the storm appease ,</l>
     <l n="115">When first t'wards Troy the Grecians took the seas ;</l>
     <l n="116">Their safe retreat another Grecian 's blood 116</l>
     <l n="117">Must purchase . ” All at this confounded stood ;</l>
     <l n="118">Each thinks himself the man , the fear on all</l>
     <l n="119">Of what the mischief but on one can fall .</l>
     <l n="120">Then Calchas ( by Ulysses first inspired )</l>
     <l n="121">Was urged to name whom th'angry god required ;</l>
     <l n="122">Yet was I warn 'd ( for many were as well</l>
     <l n="123">Inspired as he ) and did my fate foretell .</l>
     <l n="124">Ten days the prophet in suspense remain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="125">Would no man 's fate pronounce ; at last constrain 'd</l>
     <l n="126">By Ithacus , he solemnly design 'd</l>
     <l n="127">Me for the sacrifice ; the people join 'd</l>
     <l n="128">In glad consent , and all their common fear</l>
     <l n="129">Determine in my fate . The day drew near ,</l>
     <l n="130">The sacred rites prepared , my temples crown 'd 130</l>
     <l n="131">With holy wreaths ; then I confess I found</l>
     <l n="132">The means to my escape ; my bonds I brake ,</l>
     <l n="133">Fled from my guards , and in a muddy lake</l>
     <l n="134">Amongst the sedges all the night lay hid ,</l>
     <l n="135">Till they their sails had hoist ( if so they did ) .</l>
     <l n="136">And now , alas ! no hope remains for me</l>

     <l n="170">A briny sweat ; thrice brandishing her spear , 170</l>
     <l n="171">Her statue from the ground itself did rear ;</l>

     <l n="305">That of all deaths , to die in arms was best .</l>
     <l n="306">The first I met was Pantheus , Phoebus ’ priest ,</l>
     <l n="307">Who , ‘ scaping with his gods and relics , fled ,</l>
     <l n="308">And t'wards the shore his little grandchild led ;</l>
     <l n="309">‘ Pantheus , what hope remains ? what force , what place</l>
     <l n="310">Made good ? But , sighing , he replies , ‘ Alas ! 310</l>
     <l n="311">Trojans we were , and mighty Ilium was ;</l>

     <l n="317">Breaks from the bowels of the fatal horse :</l>
     <l n="318">Insulting Sinon flings about the flame ,</l>
     <l n="319">And thousands more than e'er from Argos came</l>
     <l n="320">Possess the gates , the passes , and the streets , 320</l>
     <l n="321">And these the sword o'ertakes , and those it meets .</l>
     <l n="322">The guard nor fights nor flies ; their fate so near</l>
     <l n="323">At once suspends their courage and their fear . ’ —</l>
     <l n="324">Thus by the gods , and by Atrides ’ words</l>
     <l n="325">Inspir 'd , I make my way through fire , through swords ,</l>
     <l n="326">Where noises , tumults , outcries , and alarms</l>
     <l n="327">I heard ; first Iphitus , renown 'd for arms ,</l>
     <l n="328">We meet , who knew us ( for the moon did shine )</l>
     <l n="329">Then Ripheus , Hypanis , and Dymas join</l>
     <l n="330">Their force , and young Choroebus , Mygdon 's son , 330</l>
     <l n="331">Who , by the love of fair Cassandra won ,</l>
     <l n="332">Arrived but lately in her father 's aid ;</l>
     <l n="333">Unhappy , whom the threats could not dissuade</l>
     <l n="334">Of his prophetic spouse ;</l>
     <l n="335">Whom when I saw , yet daring to maintain</l>
     <l n="336">The fight , I said , ‘ Brave spirits ! ( but in vain )</l>
     <l n="337">Are you resolv 'd to follow one who dares</l>
     <l n="338">Tempt all extremes ? The state of our affairs</l>
     <l n="339">You see : the gods have left us , by whose aid</l>
     <l n="340">Our empire stood ; nor can the flame be stay 'd : 340</l>
     <l n="341">Then let us fall amidst our foes ; this one</l>
     <l n="342">Relief the vanquish 'd have , to hope for none . ’</l>
     <l n="343">Then reinforced , as in a stormy night</l>
     <l n="344">Wolves urgèd by their raging appetite</l>
     <l n="345">Forage for prey , which their neglected young</l>
     <l n="346">With greedy jaws expect , even so among</l>
     <l n="347">Foes , fire , and swords , t'assured death we pass ;</l>
     <l n="348">Darkness our guide , Despair our leader was .</l>
     <l n="349">Who can relate that evening 's woes and spoils ,</l>
     <l n="350">Or can his tears proportion to our toils ? 350</l>
     <l n="351">The city , which so long had flourish 'd , falls ;</l>
     <l n="352">Death triumphs o'er the houses , temples , walls .</l>
     <l n="353">Nor only on the Trojans fell this doom ,</l>
     <l n="354">Their hearts at last the vanquish 'd reassume ;</l>
     <l n="355">And now the victors fall : on all sides fears ,</l>
     <l n="356">Groans , and pale Death in all her shapes appears !</l>
     <l n="357">Androgeus first with his whole troop was cast</l>
     <l n="358">Upon us , with civility misplaced</l>
     <l n="359">Thus greeting us , ‘ You lose , by your delay ,</l>
     <l n="360">Your share , both of the honour and the prey ; 360</l>
     <l n="361">Others the spoils of burning Troy convey</l>
     <l n="362">Back to those ships which you but now forsake . ’</l>
     <l n="363">We making no return , his sad mistake</l>
     <l n="364">Too late he finds ; as when an unseen snake</l>
     <l n="365">A traveller 's unwary foot hath press 'd ,</l>
     <l n="366">Who trembling starts , when the snake 's azure crest ,</l>
     <l n="367">Swoll'n with his rising anger , he espies ,</l>
     <l n="368">So from our view surprised Androgeus flies .</l>
     <l n="369">But here an easy victory we meet :</l>
     <l n="370">Fear binds their hands and ignorance their feet . 370</l>
     <l n="371">Whilst fortune our first enterprise did aid ,</l>
     <l n="372">Encouraged with success , Choroebus said ,</l>
     <l n="373">‘ O friends ! we now by better fates are led ,</l>
     <l n="374">And the fair path they lead us , let us tread .</l>
     <l n="375">First change your arms , and their distinctions bear ;</l>
     <l n="376">The same , in foes , deceit and virtue are . ’</l>
     <l n="377">Then of his arms Androgeus he divests ,</l>
     <l n="378">His sword , his shield he takes , and plumèd crests ;</l>
     <l n="379">Then Ripheus , Dymas , and the rest , all glad</l>
     <l n="380">Of the occasion , in fresh spoils are clad . 380</l>
     <l n="381">Thus mix 'd with Greeks , as if their fortune still</l>
     <l n="382">Follow 'd their swords , we fight , pursue , and kill .</l>
     <l n="383">Some re-ascend the horse , and he whose sides</l>
     <l n="384">Let forth the valiant , now the coward hides .</l>
     <l n="385">Some to their safer guard , their ships , retire ;</l>
     <l n="386">But vain 's that hope ‘ gainst which the gods conspire ;</l>
     <l n="387">Behold the royal virgin , the divine</l>
     <l n="388">Cassandra , from Minerva 's fatal shrine</l>
     <l n="389">Dragg 'd by the hair , casting t'wards heaven , in vain ,</l>
     <l n="390">Her eyes ; for cords her tender hands did strain ; 390</l>
     <l n="391">Choroebus at the spectacle enraged ,</l>
     <l n="392">Flies in amidst the foes : we thus engaged ,</l>
     <l n="393">To second him , among the thickest ran ;</l>
     <l n="394">Here first our ruin from our friends began ,</l>
     <l n="395">Who from the temple 's battlements a shower</l>
     <l n="396">Of darts and arrows on our heads did pour :</l>
     <l n="397">They us for Greeks , and now the Greeks ( who knew</l>
     <l n="398">Cassandra 's rescue ) us for Trojans slew .</l>
     <l n="399">Then from all parts Ulysses , Ajax then ,</l>
     <l n="400">And then th'Atridæ rally all their men ; 400</l>
     <l n="401">As winds , that meet from sev'ral coasts , contest ,</l>
     <l n="402">Their prisons being broke , the south and west ,</l>
     <l n="403">And Eurus on his winged coursers borne ,</l>
     <l n="404">Triumphing in their speed , the woods are torn ,</l>
     <l n="405">And chasing Nereus with his trident throws</l>
     <l n="406">The billows from their bottom ; then all those</l>
     <l n="407">Who in the dark our fury did escape ,</l>
     <l n="408">Returning , know our borrow 'd arms and shape ,</l>
     <l n="409">And diff'ring dialect : then their numbers swell</l>
     <l n="410">And grow upon us ; first Choroebus fell 410</l>
     <l n="411">Before Minerva 's altar , next did bleed</l>
     <l n="412">Just Ripheus , whom no Trojan did exceed</l>
     <l n="413">In virtue , yet the gods his fate decreed .</l>
     <l n="414">Then Hypanis and Dymas , wounded by</l>
     <l n="415">Their friends ; nor thee , Pantheus ! thy piety ,</l>
     <l n="416">Nor consecrated mitre , from the same</l>
     <l n="417">Ill fate could save . My country 's fun'ral flame</l>
     <l n="418">And Troy 's cold ashes I attest , and call</l>
     <l n="419">To witness for myself , that in their fall</l>
     <l n="420">No foes , no death , nor danger I declin 'd , 420</l>
     <l n="421">Did , and deserv 'd no less , my fate to find .</l>
     <l n="422">Now Iphitus with me , and Pelias</l>
     <l n="423">Slowly retire ; the one retarded was</l>

     <l n="428">The Greeks the gates approach 'd , their targets cast</l>

     <l n="431">And with their shields on their left arms defend</l>
     <l n="432">Arrows and darts , and with their right hold fast</l>
     <l n="433">The battlement ; on them the Trojans cast</l>
     <l n="434">Stones , rafters , pillars , beams ; such arms as these ,</l>
     <l n="435">Now hopeless , for their last defence they seize .</l>
     <l n="436">The gilded roofs , the marks of ancient state ,</l>
     <l n="437">They tumble down ; and now against the gate</l>
     <l n="438">Of th'inner court their growing force they bring ;</l>
     <l n="439">Now was our last effort to save the king ,</l>
     <l n="440">Relieve the fainting , and succeed the dead . 440</l>
     <l n="441">A private gallery ‘ twixt th'apartments led ,</l>
     <l n="442">Not to the foe yet known , or not observed ,</l>
     <l n="443">( The way for Hector 's hapless wife reserved ,</l>
     <l n="444">When to the aged king her little son</l>
     <l n="445">She would present ) ; through this we pass , and run</l>
     <l n="446">Up to the highest battlement , from whence</l>
     <l n="447">The Trojans threw their darts without offence ,</l>
     <l n="448">A tower so high , it seem 'd to reach the sky ,</l>
     <l n="449">Stood on the roof , from whence we could descry ,</l>
     <l n="450">All Ilium — both the camps , the Grecian fleet ; 450</l>
     <l n="451">This , where the beams upon the columns meet ,</l>
     <l n="452">We loosen , which like thunder from the cloud</l>
     <l n="453">Breaks on their heads , as sudden and as loud .</l>
     <l n="454">But others still succeed : meantime , nor stones</l>
     <l n="455">Nor any kind of weapons cease .</l>
     <l n="456">Before the gate in gilded armour shone</l>
     <l n="457">Young Pyrrhus , like a snake , his skin new grown ,</l>
     <l n="458">Who , fed on pois'nous herbs , all winter lay</l>
     <l n="459">Under the ground , and now reviews the day ,</l>
     <l n="460">Fresh in his new apparel , proud and young , 460</l>
     <l n="461">Rolls up his back , and brandishes his tongue ,</l>
     <l n="462">And lifts his scaly breast against the sun ;</l>
     <l n="463">With him his father 's squire , Automedon ,</l>
     <l n="464">And Peripas who drove his winged steeds ,</l>
     <l n="465">Enter the court ; whom all the youth succeeds</l>
     <l n="466">Of Scyros ’ isle , who naming firebrands flung</l>
     <l n="467">Up to the roof ; Pyrrhus himself among</l>
     <l n="468">The foremost with an axe an entrance hews</l>
     <l n="469">Through beams of solid oak , then freely views</l>
     <l n="470">The chambers , galleries , and rooms of state , 470</l>
     <l n="471">Where Priam and the ancient monarchs sate .</l>
     <l n="472">At the first gate an armed guard appears ;</l>
     <l n="473">But th'inner court with horror , noise and tears ,</l>
     <l n="474">Confus'dly fill 'd , the women 's shrieks and cries</l>
     <l n="475">The arched vaults re-echo to the skies ;</l>
     <l n="476">Sad matrons wand'ring through the spacious rooms</l>
     <l n="477">Embrace and kiss the posts ; then Pyrrhus comes ;</l>
     <l n="478">Full of his father , neither men nor walls</l>
     <l n="479">His force sustain ; the torn portcullis falls ;</l>
     <l n="480">Then from the hinge their strokes the gates divorce , 480</l>
     <l n="481">And where the way they cannot find , they force .</l>
     <l n="482">Not with such rage a swelling torrent flows</l>
     <l n="483">Above his banks , th'opposing dams o'erthrows ,</l>
     <l n="484">Depopulates the fields , the cattle , sheep ,</l>
     <l n="485">Shepherds and folds , the foaming surges sweep .</l>
     <l n="486">And now between two sad extremes I stood ,</l>
     <l n="487">Here Pyrrhus and th'Atridæ drunk with blood ,</l>
     <l n="488">There th'hapless queen amongst an hundred dames , 488</l>
     <l n="489">And Priam quenching from his wounds those flames</l>
     <l n="490">Which his own hands had on the altar laid ;</l>
     <l n="491">Then they the secret cabinets invade ,</l>
     <l n="492">Where stood the fifty nuptial beds , the hopes</l>
     <l n="493">Of that great race ; the golden posts , whose tops</l>
     <l n="494">Old hostile spoils adorn 'd , demolished lay ,</l>
     <l n="495">Or to the foe , or to the fire a prey .</l>
     <l n="496">Now Priam 's fate perhaps you may inquire :</l>
     <l n="497">Seeing his empire lost , his Troy on fire ,</l>
     <l n="498">And his own palace by the Greeks possess 'd ,</l>
     <l n="499">Arms long disused his trembling limbs invest ;</l>
     <l n="500">Thus on his foes he throws himself alone , 500</l>
     <l n="501">Not for their fate , but to provoke his own :</l>
     <l n="502">There stood an altar open to the view</l>
     <l n="503">Of heaven , near which an aged laurel grew ,</l>
     <l n="504">Whose shady arms the household gods embraced ,</l>
     <l n="505">Before whose feet the queen herself had cast</l>
     <l n="506">With all her daughters , and the Trojan wives ,</l>
     <l n="507">As doves whom an approaching tempest drives</l>
     <l n="508">And frights into one flock ; but having spied</l>
     <l n="509">Old Priam clad in youthful arms , she cried ,</l>
     <l n="510">‘ Alas ! my wretched husband ! what pretence 510</l>
     <l n="511">To bear those arms ? and in them what defence ?</l>
     <l n="512">Such aid such times require not , when again</l>
     <l n="513">If Hector were alive , he lived in vain ;</l>
     <l n="514">Or here we shall a sanctuary find ,</l>
     <l n="515">Or as in life , we shall in death be join 'd . ’</l>
     <l n="516">Then , weeping , with kind force held and embraced ,</l>
     <l n="517">And on the secret seat the king she placed .</l>
     <l n="518">Meanwhile Polites , one of Priam 's sons ,</l>
     <l n="519">Flying the rage of bloody Pyrrhus , runs</l>
     <l n="520">Through foes and swords , and ranges all the court 520</l>
     <l n="521">And empty galleries , amazed and hurt ;</l>
     <l n="522">Pyrrhus pursues him , now o'ertakes , now kills ,</l>
     <l n="523">And his last blood in Priam 's presence spills .</l>
     <l n="524">The king ( though him so many deaths enclose )</l>
     <l n="525">Nor fear , nor grief , but indignation shows ;</l>
     <l n="526">‘ The gods requite thee ( if within the care</l>
     <l n="527">Of those above th'affairs of mortals are ) ,</l>
     <l n="528">Whose fury on the son but lost had been ,</l>
     <l n="529">Had not his parents ’ eyes his murder seen :</l>
     <l n="530">Not that Achilles ( whom thou feign'st to be 530</l>
     <l n="531">Thy father ) so inhuman was to me ;</l>
     <l n="532">He blush 'd , when I the rights of arms implored ;</l>
     <l n="533">To me my Hector , me to Troy , restored . ’</l>
     <l n="534">This said , his feeble arm a jav'lin flung ,</l>
     <l n="535">Which on the sounding shield , scarce ent'ring , rung .</l>
     <l n="536">Then Pyrrhus ; ‘ Go a messenger to hell</l>
     <l n="537">Of my black deeds , and to my father tell</l>
     <l n="538">The acts of his degen'rate race . ’ So through</l>
     <l n="539">His son 's warm blood the trembling king he drew</l>
     <l n="540">To th'altar ; in his hair one hand he wreathes ; 540</l>
     <l n="541">His sword the other in his bosom sheaths .</l>
     <l n="542">Thus fell the king , who yet surviv 'd the state ,</l>
     <l n="543">With such a signal and peculiar fate ,</l>
     <l n="544">Under so vast a ruin , not a grave ,</l>
     <l n="545">Nor in such flames a fun'ral fire to have :</l>
     <l n="546">He whom such titles swell 'd , such power made proud ,</l>
     <l n="547">To whom the sceptres of all Asia bow 'd ,</l>
     <l n="548">On the cold earth lies th'unregarded king ,</l>

    <head>ON THE EARL OF STRAFFORD 'S TRIAL AND DEATH .</head>
     <l n="1">Great Strafford ! worthy of that name , though all</l>
     <l n="2">Of thee could be forgotten , but thy fall ,</l>
     <l n="3">Crush 'd by imaginary treason 's weight ,</l>
     <l n="4">Which too much merit did accumulate .</l>
     <l n="5">As chemists gold from brass by fire would draw ,</l>
     <l n="6">Pretexts are into treason forged by law .</l>
     <l n="7">His wisdom such , at once it did appear</l>
     <l n="8">Three kingdoms ’ wonder , and three kingdoms ’ fear ;</l>
     <l n="9">Whilst single he stood forth , and seem 'd , although</l>
     <l n="10">Each had an army , as an equal foe . 10</l>
     <l n="11">Such was his force of eloquence , to make</l>
     <l n="12">The hearers more concern 'd than he that spake ;</l>
     <l n="13">Each seem 'd to act that part he came to see ,</l>
     <l n="14">And none was more a looker-on than he ;</l>
     <l n="15">So did he move our passions , some were known</l>
     <l n="16">To wish , for the defence , the crime their own .</l>
     <l n="17">Now private pity strove with public hate ,</l>
     <l n="18">Reason with rage , and eloquence with fate :</l>
     <l n="19">Now they could him , if he could them , forgive ;</l>
     <l n="20">He 's not too guilty , but too wise , to live : 20</l>
     <l n="21">Less seem those facts which treason 's nickname bore ,</l>
     <l n="22">Than such a fear 'd ability for more .</l>
     <l n="23">They after death their fears of him express ,</l>
     <l n="24">His innocence and their own guilt confess .</l>
     <l n="25">Their legislative frenzy they repent ,</l>
     <l n="26">Enacting it should make no precedent .</l>
     <l n="27">This fate he could have ‘ scaped , but would not lose</l>
     <l n="28">Honour for life , but rather nobly chose</l>
     <l n="29">Death from their fears , than safety from his own ,</l>
     <l n="30">That his last action all the rest might crown . 30</l>

     <l n="119">So we from the depth and bottom of our bowels ,</l>
     <l n="120">According unto the bless 'd form you have taught us ,</l>
     <l n="121">We thank you first for the ills you have brought us : 10</l>
     <l n="122">For the good we receive we thank him that gave it ,</l>
     <l n="123">And you for the confidence only to crave it .</l>

     <l n="127">Which never had being until they were broken ;</l>
     <l n="128">But ours is a privilege ancient and native ,</l>
     <l n="129">Hangs not on an ord'nance , or power legislative .</l>
     <l n="130">And , first , ‘ tis to speak whatever we please ,</l>

     <l n="136">By this we have power to change age into youth ,</l>

     <l n="138">In brief , to make good whatsoever is faulty ;</l>
     <l n="139">This art some poet , or the devil , has taught ye :</l>
     <l n="140">And this our property you have invaded ,</l>
     <l n="141">And a privilege of both Houses have made it . 30</l>
     <l n="142">But that trust above all in poets reposed ,</l>
     <l n="143">That kings by them only are made and deposed ,</l>
     <l n="144">This though you cannot do , yet you are willing :</l>
     <l n="145">But when we undertake deposing or killing ,</l>
     <l n="146">They 're tyrants and monsters ; and yet then the poet</l>
     <l n="147">Takes full revenge on the villains that do it :</l>
     <l n="148">And when we resume a sceptre or crown ,</l>
     <l n="149">We are modest , and seek not to make it our own .</l>
     <l n="150">But is't not presumption to write verses to you ,</l>
     <l n="151">Who make better poems by far of the two ? 40</l>
     <l n="152">For all those pretty knacks you compose ,</l>
     <l n="153">Alas ! what are they but poems in prose ?</l>
     <l n="154">And between those and ours there 's no difference ,</l>
     <l n="155">But that yours want the rhyme , the wit , and the sense :</l>
     <l n="156">But for lying ( the most noble part of a poet )</l>
     <l n="157">You have it abundantly , and yourselves know it ;</l>
     <l n="158">And though you are modest and seem to abhor it ,</l>
     <l n="159">‘ T has done you good service , and thank Hell for it :</l>
     <l n="160">Although the old maxim remains still in force ,</l>
     <l n="161">That a sanctified cause must have a sanctified course , 50</l>
     <l n="162">If poverty be a part of our trade ,</l>
     <l n="163">So far the whole kingdom poets you have made ,</l>
     <l n="164">Nay , even so far as undoing will do it ,</l>
     <l n="165">You have made King Charles himself a poet :</l>
     <l n="166">But provoke not his Muse , for all the world knows ,</l>
     <l n="167">Already you have had too much of his prose .</l>

     <l n="5">Ashamed the kind Eliza to deceive ,</l>
     <l n="6">But more afraid to take a solemn leave ,</l>
     <l n="7">He many ways his lab'ring thoughts revolves ;</l>
     <l n="8">But fear o'ercoming shame , at last resolves</l>
     <l n="9">( Instructed by the god of thieves )[ 1 ] to steal</l>
     <l n="10">Himself away , and his escape conceal . 10</l>
     <l n="11">He calls his captains , bids them rig the fleet ,</l>

     <l n="14">That Dido should not their design suspect ;</l>

     <l n="20">Foretells the end : the queen with rage inflamed , 20</l>
     <l n="21">Thus greets him : ‘ Thou dissembler ! would'st thou fly</l>

     <l n="172">That perjured race , then let us die with joy .</l>
     <l n="173">What if th'event of war uncertain were ?</l>
     <l n="174">Nor death , nor danger , can the desp'rate fear .</l>
     <l n="175">But oh , too late ! this thing I should have done ,</l>
     <l n="176">When first I placed the traitor on my throne .</l>

     <l n="178">His honour 'd household gods , his aged sire</l>
     <l n="179">His pious shoulders from Troy 's flames did bear ;</l>
     <l n="180">Why did I not his carcase piecemeal tear , 180</l>
     <l n="181">And cast it in the sea ? why not destroy</l>
     <l n="182">All his companions , and belovèd boy</l>

     <l n="187">Revengeful Furies ! and Queen Hecate !</l>
     <l n="188">Receive and grant my prayer ! If he the sea</l>

     <l n="190">If Jove decree it , Jove 's decree must stand ; 190</l>
     <l n="191">When landed , may he be with arms oppress 'd</l>
     <l n="192">By his rebelling people , be distress 'd</l>
     <l n="193">By exile from his country , be divorced</l>
     <l n="194">From young Ascanius ’ sight , and be enforced</l>
     <l n="195">To implore foreign aids , and lose his friends</l>
     <l n="196">By violent and undeservèd ends !</l>
     <l n="197">When to conditions of unequal peace</l>
     <l n="198">He shall submit , then may he not possess</l>
     <l n="199">Kingdom nor life , and find his funeral 199</l>
     <l n="200">I ’ th'sands , when he before his day shall fall !</l>
     <l n="201">And ye , O Tyrians ! with immortal hate</l>
     <l n="202">Pursue this race , this service dedicate</l>

     <l n="204">‘ Twixt us and them no league nor amity .</l>
     <l n="205">May from my bones a new Achilles rise ,</l>
     <l n="206">That shall infest the Trojan colonies</l>
     <l n="207">With fire , and sword , and famine , when at length</l>
     <l n="208">Time to our great attempts contributes strength ;</l>
     <l n="209">Our seas , our shores , our armies theirs oppose ,</l>
     <l n="210">And may our children be for ever foes ! ’ 210</l>
     <l n="211">A ghastly paleness death 's approach portends ,</l>
     <l n="212">Then trembling she the fatal pile ascends ;</l>

     <l n="214">Aeneas ’ sword , not for that use bequeath 'd :</l>
     <l n="215">Then on the guilty bed she gently lays</l>
     <l n="216">Herself , and softly thus lamenting prays ;</l>
     <l n="217">‘ Dear relics ! whilst that Gods and Fates give leave ,</l>
     <l n="218">Free me from cares and my glad soul receive .</l>

     <l n="224">Had not the Trojan on my coast arrived .</l>
     <l n="225">But shall I die without revenge ? yet die</l>
     <l n="226">Thus , thus with joy to thy Sichæus fly .</l>
     <l n="227">My conscious foe my funeral fire shall view</l>
     <l n="228">From sea , and may that omen him pursue ! ’</l>
     <l n="229">Her fainting hand let fall the sword besmear 'd</l>
     <l n="230">With blood , and then the mortal wound appear 'd ; 230</l>
     <l n="231">Through all the court the fright and clamours rise ,</l>
     <l n="232">Which the whole city fills with fears and cries ,</l>
     <l n="233">As loud as if her Carthage , or old Tyre</l>
     <l n="234">The foe had enter 'd , and had set on fire .</l>
     <l n="235">Amazèd Anne with speed ascends the stairs ,</l>
     <l n="236">And in her arms her dying sister rears ;</l>
     <l n="237">‘ Did you for this yourself and me beguile ?</l>
     <l n="238">For such an end did I erect this pile ?</l>
     <l n="239">Did you so much despise me , in this fate</l>
     <l n="240">Myself with you not to associate ? 240</l>
     <l n="241">Yourself and me , alas ! this fatal wound ,</l>
     <l n="242">The senate , and the people , doth confound .</l>
     <l n="243">I 'll wash her wound with tears , and at her death ,</l>
     <l n="244">My lips from hers shall draw her parting breath . ’</l>
     <l n="245">Then with her vest the wound she wipes and dries ;</l>
     <l n="246">Thrice with her arm the Queen attempts to rise ,</l>
     <l n="247">But her strength failing , falls into a swound ,</l>
     <l n="248">Life 's last efforts yet striving with her wound ;</l>
     <l n="249">Thrice on her bed she turns , with wand'ring sight</l>
     <l n="250">Seeking , she groans when she beholds the light . 250</l>
     <l n="251">Then Juno , pitying her disastrous fate ,</l>
     <l n="252">Sends Iris down , her pangs to mitigate .</l>

     <l n="256">‘ To Pluto I bequeath , and set thee free ; ’</l>
     <l n="257">Then clips her hair : cold numbness strait bereaves</l>

    <head>OF PRUDENCE .</head>
     <l n="1">Wisdom 's first progress is to take a view</l>
     <l n="2">What 's decent or indecent , false or true .</l>
     <l n="3">He 's truly prudent who can separate</l>
     <l n="4">Honest from vile , and still adhere to that ;</l>
     <l n="5">Their difference to measure , and to reach</l>
     <l n="6">Reason well rectified must Nature teach .</l>
     <l n="7">And these high scrutinies are subjects fit</l>
     <l n="8">For man 's all-searching and inquiring wit ;</l>
     <l n="9">That search of knowledge did from Adam flow ;</l>
     <l n="10">Who wants it yet abhors his wants to show . 10</l>
     <l n="11">Wisdom of what herself approves makes choice ,</l>
     <l n="12">Nor is led captive by the common voice .</l>
     <l n="13">Clear-sighted Reason Wisdom 's judgment leads ,</l>
     <l n="14">And Sense , her vassal , in her footsteps treads .</l>
     <l n="15">That thou to Truth the perfect way may'st know ,</l>
     <l n="16">To thee all her specific forms I 'll show :</l>
     <l n="17">He that the way to honesty will learn ,</l>
     <l n="18">First what 's to be avoided must discern .</l>
     <l n="19">Thyself from flatt'ring selfhYpppHeNconceit defend ,</l>
     <l n="20">Nor what thou dost not know to know pretend . 20</l>
     <l n="21">Some secrets deep in abstruse darkness lie :</l>
     <l n="22">To search them thou wilt need a piercing eye .</l>
     <l n="23">Not rashly therefore to such things assent ,</l>
     <l n="24">Which , undeceived , thou after may'st repent ;</l>
     <l n="25">Study and time in these must thee instruct ,</l>
     <l n="26">And others ’ old experience may conduct .</l>
     <l n="27">Wisdom herself her ear doth often lend</l>
     <l n="28">To counsel offer 'd by a faithful friend .</l>
     <l n="29">In equal scales two doubtful matters lay ,</l>
     <l n="30">Thou may'st choose safely that which most doth weigh ;</l>
     <l n="31">‘ Tis not secure this place or that to guard , 31</l>
     <l n="32">If any other entrance stand unbarr 'd :</l>
     <l n="33">He that escapes the serpent 's teeth may fail ,</l>
     <l n="34">If he himself secures not from his tail .</l>
     <l n="35">Who saith , who could such ill events expect ?</l>
     <l n="36">With shame on his own counsels doth reflect .</l>
     <l n="37">Most in the world doth self-conceit deceive , 37</l>
     <l n="38">Who just and good whate'er they act believe ;</l>
     <l n="39">To their wills wedded , to their errors slaves ,</l>
     <l n="40">No man ( like them ) they think himself behaves .</l>
     <l n="41">This stiff-neck 'd pride nor art nor force can bend ,</l>
     <l n="42">Nor high-flown hopes to Reason 's lure descend .</l>
     <l n="43">Fathers sometimes their children 's faults regard</l>
     <l n="44">With pleasure , and their crimes with gifts reward .</l>
     <l n="45">Ill painters , when they draw , and poets write ,</l>
     <l n="46">Virgil and Titian ( self admiring ) slight ;</l>
     <l n="47">Then all they do like gold and pearl appears ,</l>
     <l n="48">And others ’ actions are but dirt to theirs .</l>
     <l n="49">They that so highly think themselves above</l>
     <l n="50">All other men , themselves can only love ; 50</l>
     <l n="51">Reason and virtue , all that man can boast</l>
     <l n="52">O'er other creatures , in those brutes are lost .</l>
     <l n="53">Observe ( if thee this fatal error touch ,</l>
     <l n="54">Thou to thyself contributing too much )</l>
     <l n="55">Those who are gen'rous , humble , just and wise ,</l>
     <l n="56">Who not their gold , nor themselves idolise ;</l>
     <l n="57">To form thyself by their example learn ,</l>
     <l n="58">( For many eyes can more than one discern ) ,</l>
     <l n="59">But yet beware of councils when too full ,</l>
     <l n="60">Number makes long disputes , and graveness dull ; 60</l>
     <l n="61">Though their advice be good , their counsel wise ,</l>
     <l n="62">Yet length still loses opportunities :</l>
     <l n="63">Debate destroys despatch , as fruits we see</l>
     <l n="64">Rot when they hang too long upon the tree ;</l>
     <l n="65">In vain that husbandman his seed doth sow ,</l>
     <l n="66">If he his crop not in due season mow .</l>
     <l n="67">A gen'ral sets his army in array</l>
     <l n="68">In vain , unless he fight and win the day .</l>
     <l n="69">‘ Tis virtuous action that must praise bring forth ,</l>
     <l n="70">Without which , slow advice is little worth . 70</l>
     <l n="71">Yet they who give good counsel praise deserve ,</l>
     <l n="72">Though in the active part they cannot serve .</l>
     <l n="73">In action , learned counsellors their age ,</l>
     <l n="74">Profession , or disease , forbids t'engage .</l>
     <l n="75">Nor to philosophers is praise denied ,</l>
     <l n="76">Whose wise instructions after ages guide ;</l>
     <l n="77">Yet vainly most their age in study spend ;</l>
     <l n="78">No end of writing books , and to no end :</l>
     <l n="79">Beating their brains for strange and hidden things ,</l>
     <l n="80">Whose knowledge , nor delight , nor profit brings ; 80</l>
     <l n="81">Themselves with doubts both day and night perplex ,</l>
     <l n="82">Nor gentle reader please , or teach , but vex .</l>
     <l n="83">Books should to one of these four ends conduce —</l>
     <l n="84">For wisdom , piety , delight , or use .</l>
     <l n="85">What need we gaze upon the spangled sky ?</l>
     <l n="86">Or into matter 's hidden causes pry ?</l>
     <l n="87">To describe every city , stream , or hill</l>
     <l n="88">I ’ th'world , our fancy with vain arts to fill ?</l>
     <l n="89">What is't to hear a sophister , that pleads ,</l>
     <l n="90">Who by the ears the deceived audience leads ? 90</l>
     <l n="91">If we were wise , these things we should not mind ,</l>
     <l n="92">But more delight in easy matters find .</l>
     <l n="93">Learn to live well , that thou may'st die so too ;</l>
     <l n="94">To live and die is all we have to do :</l>
     <l n="95">The way ( if no digression 's made ) is even ,</l>
     <l n="96">And free access , if we but ask , is given .</l>
     <l n="97">Then seek to know those things which make us bless 'd ,</l>
     <l n="98">And having found them , lock them in thy breast ;</l>
     <l n="99">Inquiring then the way , go on , nor slack ,</l>
     <l n="100">But mend thy pace , nor think of going back . 100</l>
     <l n="101">Some their whole age in these inquiries waste ,</l>
     <l n="102">And die like fools before one step they 've pass 'd ;</l>
     <l n="103">‘ Tis strange to know the way , and not t'advance ;</l>
     <l n="104">That knowledge is far worse than ignorance .</l>
     <l n="105">The learned teach , but what they teach , not do ,</l>
     <l n="106">And standing still themselves , make others go .</l>
     <l n="107">In vain on study time away we throw ,</l>
     <l n="108">When we forbear to act the things we know .</l>
     <l n="109">The soldier that philosopher well blamed ,</l>
     <l n="110">Who long and loudly in the schools declaim 'd ; 110</l>
     <l n="111">‘ Tell ’ ( said the soldier ) ‘ venerable Sir ,</l>
     <l n="112">Why all these words , this clamour , and this stir ?</l>
     <l n="113">Why do disputes in wrangling spend the day ,</l>
     <l n="114">Whilst one says only yea , and t'other nay ? ’</l>
     <l n="115">‘ Oh , ’ said the doctor , ‘ we for wisdom toil 'd ,</l>
     <l n="116">For which none toils too much . ’ The soldier smiled ;</l>
     <l n="117">‘ You 're gray and old , and to some pious use</l>
     <l n="118">This mass of treasure you should now reduce :</l>
     <l n="119">But you your store have hoarded in some bank ,</l>
     <l n="120">For which th'infernal spirits shall you thank . ’ 120</l>
     <l n="121">Let what thou learnest be by practice shown ;</l>
     <l n="122">‘ Tis said that wisdom 's children make her known .</l>
     <l n="123">What 's good doth open to th'inquirer stand ,</l>
     <l n="124">And itself offers to th'accepting hand ;</l>
     <l n="125">All things by order and true measures done ,</l>
     <l n="126">Wisdom will end , as well as she begun .</l>
     <l n="127">Let early care thy main concerns secure ,</l>
     <l n="128">Things of less moment may delays endure :</l>
     <l n="129">Men do not for their servants first prepare ,</l>
     <l n="130">And of their wives and children quit the care ; 130</l>
     <l n="131">Yet when we 're sick , the doctor 's fetch 'd in haste ,</l>
     <l n="132">Leaving our great concernment to the last .</l>
     <l n="133">When we are well , our hearts are only set</l>
     <l n="134">( Which way we care not ) to be rich , or great ;</l>
     <l n="135">What shall become of all that we have got ?</l>
     <l n="136">We only know that us it follows not ;</l>
     <l n="137">And what a trifle is a moment 's breath ,</l>
     <l n="138">Laid in the scale with everlasting death !</l>
     <l n="139">What 's time when on eternity we think ! 139</l>
     <l n="140">A thousand ages in that sea must sink .</l>
     <l n="141">Time 's nothing but a word ; a million</l>
     <l n="142">Is full as far from infinite as one .</l>
     <l n="143">To whom thou much dost owe , thou much must pay ,</l>
     <l n="144">Think on the debt against th'accounting day .</l>
     <l n="145">God , who to thee reason and knowledge lent ,</l>
     <l n="146">Will ask how these two talents have been spent .</l>
     <l n="147">Let not low pleasures thy high reason blind ,</l>
     <l n="148">He 's mad , that seeks what no man e'er could find .</l>
     <l n="149">Why should we fondly please our sense , wherein</l>
     <l n="150">Beasts us exceed , nor feel the stings of sin ? 150</l>
     <l n="151">What thoughts man 's reason better can become ,</l>
     <l n="152">Than th'expectation of his welcome home ?</l>
     <l n="153">Lords of the world have but for life their lease ,</l>
     <l n="154">And that too ( if the lessor please ) must cease .</l>
     <l n="155">Death cancels nature 's bonds , but for our deeds</l>
     <l n="156">( That debt first paid ) a strict account succeeds ;</l>
     <l n="157">If here not clear 'd , no suretyship can bail</l>
     <l n="158">Condemned debtors from th'eternal jail ;</l>
     <l n="159">Christ 's blood 's our balsam ; if that cure us here ,</l>
     <l n="160">Him , when our judge , we shall not find severe ; 160</l>
     <l n="161">His yoke is easy when by us embraced ,</l>
     <l n="162">But loads and galls , if on our necks ‘ tis cast .</l>
     <l n="163">Be just in all thy actions , and if join 'd</l>
     <l n="164">With those that are not , never change thy mind .</l>
     <l n="165">If ought obstruct thy course , yet stand not still ,</l>
     <l n="166">But wind about , till you have topp 'd the hill ;</l>
     <l n="167">To the same end men sev'ral paths may tread ,</l>
     <l n="168">As many doors into one temple lead ;</l>
     <l n="169">And the same hand into a fist may close ,</l>
     <l n="170">Which , instantly a palm expanded shows . 170</l>
     <l n="171">Justice and faith never forsake the wise ,</l>
     <l n="172">Yet may occasion put him in disguise ;</l>
     <l n="173">Not turning like the wind ; but if the state</l>
     <l n="174">Of things must change , he is not obstinate ;</l>
     <l n="175">Things past and future with the present weighs ,</l>
     <l n="176">Nor credulous of what vain rumour says .</l>
     <l n="177">Few things by wisdom are at first believed ;</l>
     <l n="178">An easy ear deceives , and is deceived :</l>
     <l n="179">For many truths have often pass 'd for lies ,</l>
     <l n="180">And lies as often put on truth 's disguise ; 180</l>
     <l n="181">As flattery too oft like friendship shows ,</l>
     <l n="182">So them who speak plain truth we think our foes .</l>
     <l n="183">No quick reply to dubious questions make ,</l>
     <l n="184">Suspense and caution still prevent mistake .</l>
     <l n="185">When any great design thou dost intend ,</l>
     <l n="186">Think on the means , the manner , and the end :</l>
     <l n="187">All great concernments must delays endure ;</l>
     <l n="188">Rashness and haste make all things unsecure ;</l>
     <l n="189">And if uncertain thy pretensions be ,</l>
     <l n="190">Stay till fit time wear out uncertainty ; 190</l>
     <l n="191">But if to unjust things thou dost pretend ,</l>
     <l n="192">Ere they begin let thy pretensions end .</l>
     <l n="193">Let thy discourse be such that thou may'st give</l>
     <l n="194">Profit to others , or from them receive :</l>
     <l n="195">Instruct the ignorant ; to those that live</l>
     <l n="196">Under thy care , good rules and patterns give ;</l>
     <l n="197">Nor is't the least of virtues , to relieve</l>
     <l n="198">Those whom afflictions or oppressions grieve .</l>
     <l n="199">Commend but sparingly whom thou dost love :</l>
     <l n="200">But less condemn whom thou dost not approve ; 200</l>
     <l n="201">Thy friend , like flatt'ry , too much praise doth wrong ,</l>
     <l n="202">And too sharp censure shows an evil tongue :</l>
     <l n="203">But let inviolate truth be always dear</l>
     <l n="204">To thee ; e'en before friendship , truth prefer .</l>
     <l n="205">Than what thou mean'st to give , still promise less :</l>
     <l n="206">Hold fast thy power thy promise to increase .</l>
     <l n="207">Look forward what 's to come , and back what 's past ,</l>
     <l n="208">Thy life will be with praise and prudence graced : 208</l>
     <l n="209">What loss or gain may follow , thou may'st guess ,</l>
     <l n="210">Thou then wilt be secure of the success ;</l>
     <l n="211">Yet be not always on affairs intent ,</l>
     <l n="212">But let thy thoughts be easy , and unbent :</l>
     <l n="213">When our minds ’ eyes are disengaged and free ,</l>
     <l n="214">They clearer , farther , and distinctly see ;</l>
     <l n="215">They quicken sloth , perplexities untie ,</l>
     <l n="216">Make roughness smooth , and hardness mollify ;</l>
     <l n="217">And though our hands from labour are released ,</l>
     <l n="218">Yet our minds find ( even when we sleep ) no rest .</l>
     <l n="219">Search not to find how other men offend ,</l>
     <l n="220">But by that glass thy own offences mend ; 220</l>
     <l n="221">Still seek to learn , yet care not much from whom ,</l>
     <l n="222">( So it be learning ) or from whence it come .</l>
     <l n="223">Of thy own actions , others ’ judgments learn ;</l>
     <l n="224">Often by small , great matters we discern :</l>
     <l n="225">Youth what man 's age is like to be doth show ;</l>
     <l n="226">We may our ends by our beginnings know .</l>
     <l n="227">Let none direct thee what to do or say ,</l>
     <l n="228">Till thee thy judgment of the matter sway ;</l>
     <l n="229">Let not the pleasing many thee delight ,</l>
     <l n="230">First judge if those whom thou dost please judge right . 230</l>
     <l n="231">Search not to find what lies too deeply hid ,</l>
     <l n="232">Nor to know things whose knowledge is forbid ;</l>
     <l n="233">Nor climb on pyramids , which thy head turn round</l>
     <l n="234">Standing , and whence no safe descent is found .</l>
     <l n="235">In vain his nerves and faculties he strains</l>
     <l n="236">To rise , whose raising unsecure remains :</l>
     <l n="237">They whom desert and favour forwards thrust ,</l>
     <l n="238">Are wise , when they their measures can adjust .</l>
     <l n="239">When well at ease , and happy , live content ,</l>
     <l n="240">And then consider why that life was lent . 240</l>
     <l n="241">When wealthy , show thy wisdom not to be</l>
     <l n="242">To wealth a servant , but make wealth serve thee .</l>
     <l n="243">Though all alone , yet nothing think or do ,</l>
     <l n="244">Which nor a witness , nor a judge might know .</l>
     <l n="245">The highest hill is the most slipp'ry place ,</l>
     <l n="246">And Fortune mocks us with a smiling face ;</l>
     <l n="247">And her unsteady hand hath often placed</l>
     <l n="248">Men in high power , but seldom holds them fast ;</l>
     <l n="249">Against her then her forces Prudence joins ,</l>
     <l n="250">And to the golden mien herself confines . 250</l>
     <l n="251">More in prosperity is reason toss 'd ,</l>
     <l n="252">Than ships in storms , their helms and anchors lost :</l>
     <l n="253">Before fair gales not all our sails we bear ,</l>
     <l n="254">But with side winds into safe harbours steer ;</l>
     <l n="255">More ships in calms , on a deceitful coast ,</l>
     <l n="256">Or unseen rocks , than in high storms are lost .</l>
     <l n="257">Who casts out threats and frowns no man deceives ,</l>
     <l n="258">Time for resistance and defence he gives ;</l>
     <l n="259">But flatt'ry still in sugar 'd words betrays ,</l>
     <l n="260">And poison in high-tasted meats conveys ; 260</l>
     <l n="261">So Fortune 's smiles unguarded man surprise ,</l>
     <l n="262">But when she frowns , he arms , and her defies .</l>

    <head>OF JUSTICE .</head>
     <l n="1">‘ Tis the first sanction Nature gave to man ,</l>
     <l n="2">Each other to assist in what they can ;</l>
     <l n="3">Just or unjust , this law for ever stands ;</l>
     <l n="4">All things are good by law which she commands ;</l>
     <l n="5">The first step , man t'wards Christ must justly live ,</l>
     <l n="6">Who t'us himself , and all we have , did give ;</l>
     <l n="7">In vain doth man the name of just expect ,</l>
     <l n="8">If his devotions he to God neglect ;</l>
     <l n="9">So must we rev'rence God , as first to know 9</l>
     <l n="10">Justice from Him , not from ourselves , doth flow ;</l>
     <l n="11">God those accepts who to mankind are friends ,</l>
     <l n="12">Whose justice far as their own power extends ;</l>
     <l n="13">In that they imitate the power Divine ;</l>
     <l n="14">The sun alike on good and bad doth shine ;</l>
     <l n="15">And he that doth no good , although no ill ,</l>
     <l n="16">Does not the office of the just fulfil .</l>
     <l n="17">Virtue doth man to virtuous actions steer ,</l>
     <l n="18">‘ Tis not enough that he should vice forbear ;</l>
     <l n="19">We live not only for ourselves to care ,</l>
     <l n="20">Whilst they that want it are denied their share . 20</l>
     <l n="21">Wise Plato said , the world with men was stored ,</l>
     <l n="22">That succour each to other might afford ;</l>
     <l n="23">Nor are those succours to one sort confined ,</l>
     <l n="24">But sev'ral parts to sev'ral men consign 'd ;</l>
     <l n="25">He that of his own stores no part can give ,</l>
     <l n="26">May with his counsel or his hands relieve .</l>
     <l n="27">If Fortune make thee powerful , give defence</l>
     <l n="28">‘ Gainst fraud and force , to naked innocence :</l>
     <l n="29">And when our Justice doth her tributes pay ,</l>
     <l n="30">Method and order must direct the way . 30</l>
     <l n="31">First to our God we must with rev'rence bow ;</l>
     <l n="32">The second honour to our prince we owe ;</l>
     <l n="33">Next to wives , parents , children , fit respect ,</l>
     <l n="34">And to our friends and kindred , we direct ;</l>
     <l n="35">Then we must those who groan beneath the weight</l>
     <l n="36">Of age , disease , or want , commiserate .</l>
     <l n="37">‘ Mongst those whom honest lives can recommend ,</l>
     <l n="38">Our Justice more compassion should extend ;</l>
     <l n="39">To such , who thee in some distress did aid ,</l>
     <l n="40">Thy debt of thanks with int'rest should be paid : 40</l>
     <l n="41">As Hesiod sings , spread waters o'er thy field ,</l>
     <l n="42">And a most just and glad increase ‘ twill yield .</l>
     <l n="43">But yet take heed , lest doing good to one ,</l>
     <l n="44">Mischief and wrong be to another done ;</l>
     <l n="45">Such moderation with thy bounty join ,</l>
     <l n="46">That thou may'st nothing give that is not thine ;</l>
     <l n="47">That liberality 's but cast away ,</l>
     <l n="48">Which makes us borrow what we cannot pay .</l>
     <l n="49">And no access to wealth let rapine bring ;</l>
     <l n="50">Do nothing that 's unjust to be a king . 50</l>
     <l n="51">Justice must be from violence exempt ,</l>
     <l n="52">But fraud 's her only object of contempt .</l>
     <l n="53">Fraud in the fox , force in the lion dwells ;</l>
     <l n="54">But Justice both from human hearts expels ;</l>
     <l n="55">But he 's the greatest monster ( without doubt )</l>
     <l n="56">Who is a wolf within , a sheep without .</l>
     <l n="57">Nor only ill injurious actions are ,</l>
     <l n="58">But evil words and slanders bear their share .</l>
     <l n="59">Truth Justice loves , and truth injustice fears ,</l>
     <l n="60">Truth above all things a just man reveres . 60</l>
     <l n="61">Though not by oaths we God to witness call ,</l>
     <l n="62">He sees and hears , and still remembers all ;</l>
     <l n="63">And yet our attestations we may wrest</l>
     <l n="64">Sometimes to make the truth more manifest ;</l>
     <l n="65">If by a lie a man preserve his faith ,</l>
     <l n="66">He pardon , leave , and absolution hath ;</l>
     <l n="67">Or if I break my promise , which to thee</l>
     <l n="68">Would bring no good , but prejudice to me .</l>
     <l n="69">All things committed to thy trust conceal ,</l>
     <l n="70">Nor what 's forbid by any means reveal . 70</l>
     <l n="71">Express thyself in plain , not doubtful words ,</l>
     <l n="72">That ground for quarrels or disputes affords :</l>
     <l n="73">Unless thou find occasion , hold thy tongue ;</l>
     <l n="74">Thyself or others careless talk may wrong .</l>
     <l n="75">When thou art called into public power ,</l>
     <l n="76">And when a crowd of suitors throng thy door ,</l>
     <l n="77">Be sure no great offenders ‘ scape their dooms ; 77</l>
     <l n="78">Small praise from lenity and remissness comes ;</l>
     <l n="79">Crimes pardon 'd , others to those crimes invite ,</l>
     <l n="80">Whilst lookers-on severe examples fright .</l>
     <l n="81">When by a pardon 'd murd'rer blood is spilt ,</l>
     <l n="82">The judge that pardon 'd hath the greatest guilt ;</l>
     <l n="83">Who accuse rigour , make a gross mistake ;</l>
     <l n="84">One criminal pardon 'd may an hundred make ;</l>
     <l n="85">When justice on offenders is not done ,</l>
     <l n="86">Law , government , and commerce , are o'erthrown ;</l>
     <l n="87">As besieged traitors with the foe conspire ,</l>
     <l n="88">T ’ unlock the gates , and set the town on fire .</l>
     <l n="89">Yet lest the punishment th'offence exceed ,</l>
     <l n="90">Justice with weight and measure must proceed : 90</l>
     <l n="91">Yet when pronouncing sentence , seem not glad ,</l>
     <l n="92">Such spectacles , though they are just , are sad ;</l>
     <l n="93">Though what thou dost thou ought'st not to repent ,</l>
     <l n="94">Yet human bowels cannot but relent :</l>
     <l n="95">Rather than all must suffer , some must die ;</l>
     <l n="96">Yet Nature must condole their misery .</l>
     <l n="97">And yet , if many equal guilt involve ,</l>
     <l n="98">Thou may'st not these condemn , and those absolve .</l>
     <l n="99">Justice , when equal scales she holds , is blind ;</l>
     <l n="100">Nor cruelty , nor mercy , change her mind . 100</l>
     <l n="101">When some escape for that which others die ,</l>
     <l n="102">Mercy to those , to these is cruelty .</l>
     <l n="103">A fine and slender net the spider weaves ,</l>
     <l n="104">Which little and light animals receives ;</l>
     <l n="105">And if she catch a common bee or fly ,</l>
     <l n="106">They with a piteous groan and murmur die ;</l>
     <l n="107">But if a wasp or hornet she entrap ,</l>
     <l n="108">They tear her cords like Samson , and escape ;</l>
     <l n="109">So like a fly the poor offender dies ,</l>
     <l n="110">But like the wasp , the rich escapes and flies . 110</l>
     <l n="111">Do not , if one but lightly thee offend ,</l>
     <l n="112">The punishment beyond the crime extend ;</l>
     <l n="113">Or after warning the offence forget ;</l>
     <l n="114">So God himself our failings doth remit .</l>
     <l n="115">Expect not more from servants than is just ,</l>
     <l n="116">Reward them well , if they observe their trust ;</l>
     <l n="117">Nor them with cruelty or pride invade ,</l>
     <l n="118">Since God and Nature them our brothers made ;</l>
     <l n="119">If his offence be great , let that suffice ;</l>
     <l n="120">If light , forgive , for no man 's always wise . 120</l>

    <head>THE PROGRESS OF LEARNING .</head>
    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">My early mistress , now my ancient Muse ,</l>
     <l n="2">That strong Circæan liquor cease t'infuse ,</l>
     <l n="3">Wherewith thou didst intoxicate my youth ,</l>
     <l n="4">Now stoop with disenchanted wings to truth ;</l>
     <l n="5">As the dove 's flight did guide Aeneas , now</l>
     <l n="6">May thine conduct me to the golden bough :</l>
     <l n="7">Tell ( like a tall old oak ) how learning shoots</l>
     <l n="8">To heaven her branches , and to hell her roots .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">When God from earth form 'd Adam in the East ,</l>
     <l n="10">He his own image on the clay impress 'd ;</l>
     <l n="11">As subjects then the whole creation came ,</l>
     <l n="12">And from their natures Adam them did name ,</l>
     <l n="13">Not from experience ( for the world was new ) ,</l>
     <l n="14">He only from their cause their natures knew .</l>
     <l n="15">Had memory been lost with innocence ,</l>
     <l n="16">We had not known the sentence nor th'offence ;</l>
     <l n="17">‘ Twas his chief punishment to keep in store</l>
     <l n="18">The sad remembrance what he was before ; 10</l>
     <l n="19">And though th'offending part felt mortal pain ,</l>
     <l n="20">Th ’ immortal part its knowledge did retain .</l>
     <l n="21">After the flood , arts to Chaldea fell ;</l>
     <l n="22">The father of the faithful there did dwell ,</l>
     <l n="23">Who both their parent and instructor was ;</l>
     <l n="24">From thence did learning into Egypt pass :</l>
     <l n="25">Moses in all the Egyptian arts was skill 'd ,</l>
     <l n="26">When heavenly power that chosen vessel fill 'd ;</l>
     <l n="27">And we to his high inspiration owe ,</l>
     <l n="28">That what was done before the flood we know . 20</l>
     <l n="29">Prom Egypt , arts their progress made to Greece ,</l>
     <l n="30">Wrapp 'd in the fable of the golden fleece .</l>
     <l n="31">Musæus first , then Orpheus , civilise</l>
     <l n="32">Mankind , and gave the world their deities ;</l>
     <l n="33">To many gods they taught devotion ,</l>
     <l n="34">Which were the distinct faculties of one ;</l>
     <l n="35">Th ’ Eternal Cause , in their immortal lines</l>
     <l n="36">Was taught , and poets were the first divines :</l>
     <l n="37">God Moses first , then David , did inspire ,</l>
     <l n="38">To compose anthems , for his heavenly choir ; 30</l>
     <l n="39">To th'one the style of friend he did impart ,</l>
     <l n="40">On th'other stamp the likeness of his heart :</l>
     <l n="41">And Moses , in the old original ,</l>
     <l n="42">Even God the poet of the world doth call .</l>
     <l n="43">Next those old Greeks Pythagoras did rise ,</l>
     <l n="44">Then Socrates , whom th'oracle call 'd Wise ;</l>
     <l n="45">The divine Plato moral virtue shows ,</l>
     <l n="46">Then his disciple Aristotle rose ,</l>
     <l n="47">Who Nature 's secrets to the world did teach ,</l>
     <l n="48">Yet that great soul our novelists impeach ; 40</l>
     <l n="49">Too much manuring fill 'd that field with weeds ,</l>
     <l n="50">While sects , like locusts , did destroy the seeds ;</l>
     <l n="51">The tree of knowledge , blasted by disputes ,</l>
     <l n="52">Produces sapless leaves instead of fruits ;</l>
     <l n="53">Proud Greece all nations else barbarians held ,</l>
     <l n="54">Boasting her learning all the world excell 'd .</l>
     <l n="55">Flying from thence<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>to Italy it came , 47</l>
     <l n="56">And to the realm of Naples gave the name ,</l>
     <l n="57">Till both their nation and their arts did come</l>
     <l n="58">A welcome trophy to triumphant Rome ;</l>
     <l n="59">Then whereso'er her conqu'ring eagles fled ,</l>
     <l n="60">Arts , learning , and civility were spread ;</l>
     <l n="61">And as in this our microcosm , the heart</l>
     <l n="62">Heat , spirit , motion gives to every part ,</l>
     <l n="63">So Rome 's victorious influence did disperse</l>
     <l n="64">All her own virtues through the universe .</l>
     <l n="65">Here some digression I must make , t'accuse</l>
     <l n="66">Thee , my forgetful , and ingrateful Muse :</l>
     <l n="67">Couldst thou from Greece to Latium take thy flight ,</l>
     <l n="68">And not to thy great ancestor do right ? 60</l>
     <l n="69">I can no more believe old Homer blind ,</l>
     <l n="70">Than those who say the sun hath never shined ;</l>
     <l n="71">The age wherein he lived was dark , but he</l>
     <l n="72">Could not want sight who taught the world to see :</l>
     <l n="73">They who Minerva from Jove 's head derive ,</l>
     <l n="74">Might make old Homer 's skull the Muses ’ hive ;</l>
     <l n="75">And from his brain that Helicon distil</l>
     <l n="76">Whose racy liquor did his offspring fill .</l>
     <l n="77">Nor old Anacreon , Hesiod , Theocrite ,</l>
     <l n="78">Must we forget , nor Pindar 's lofty flight . 70</l>
     <l n="79">Old Homer 's soul , at last from Greece retired ,</l>
     <l n="80">In Italy the Mantuan swain inspired .</l>
     <l n="81">When great Augustus made war 's tempest cease ,</l>
     <l n="82">His halcyon days brought forth the arts of peace ;</l>
     <l n="83">He still in his triumphant chariot shines ,</l>
     <l n="84">By Horace drawn , and Virgil 's mighty lines .</l>
     <l n="85">‘ Twas certainly mysterious that the name<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span></l>
     <l n="86">Of prophets and of poets is the same ;</l>
     <l n="87">What the tragedian<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>— wrote , the late success 79</l>
     <l n="88">Declares was inspiration , and not guess :</l>
     <l n="89">As dark a truth that author did unfold ,</l>
     <l n="90">As oracles or prophets e'er foretold :</l>
     <l n="91">‘ At last the ocean shall unlock the bound</l>
     <l n="92">Of things , and a new world by Tiphys found ,</l>
     <l n="93">Then ages far remote shall understand</l>
     <l n="94">The Isle of Thule is not the farthest land . ’</l>
     <l n="95">Sure God , by these discov'ries , did design</l>
     <l n="96">That his clear light through all the world should shine ,</l>
     <l n="97">But the obstruction from that discord springs</l>
     <l n="98">The prince of darkness made ‘ twixt Christian kings ; 90</l>
     <l n="99">That peaceful age with happiness to crown ,</l>
     <l n="100">From heaven the Prince of Peace himself came down ,</l>
     <l n="101">Then the true sun of knowledge first appear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="102">And the old dark mysterious clouds were clear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="103">The heavy cause of th'old accursèd flood</l>
     <l n="104">Sunk in the sacred deluge of his blood .</l>
     <l n="105">His passion man from his first fall redeem 'd ;</l>
     <l n="106">Once more to paradise restored we seem 'd ;</l>
     <l n="107">Satan himself was bound , till th'iron chain</l>
     <l n="108">Our pride did break , and let him loose again . 100</l>
     <l n="109">Still the old sting remain 'd , and man began</l>
     <l n="110">To tempt the serpent , as he tempted man ;</l>
     <l n="111">Then Hell sends forth her furies , Av'rice , Pride ,</l>
     <l n="112">Fraud , Discord , Force , Hypocrisy their guide ;</l>
     <l n="113">Though the foundation on a rock were laid ,</l>
     <l n="114">The church was undermined , and then betray 'd :</l>
     <l n="115">Though the Apostles these events foretold ,</l>
     <l n="116">Yet even the shepherd did devour the fold :</l>
     <l n="117">The fisher to convert the world began ,</l>
     <l n="118">The pride convincing of vain-glorious man ; 110</l>
     <l n="119">But soon his followers grew a sovereign lord ,</l>
     <l n="120">And Peter 's keys exchanged for Peter 's sword ,</l>
     <l n="121">Which still maintains for his adopted son</l>
     <l n="122">Vast patrimonies , though himself had none ;</l>
     <l n="123">Wresting the text to the old giant 's sense ,</l>
     <l n="124">That heaven , once more , must suffer violence .</l>
     <l n="125">Then subtle doctors Scriptures made their prize ;</l>
     <l n="126">Casuists , like cocks , struck out each others eyes ;</l>
     <l n="127">Then dark distinctions reason 's light disguised ,</l>
     <l n="128">And into atoms truth anatomised . 120</l>
     <l n="129">Then Mah'met ' s crescent , by our feuds increased ,</l>
     <l n="130">Blasted the learn 'd remainders of the East ;</l>
     <l n="131">That project , when from Greece to Rome it came ,</l>
     <l n="132">Made Mother Ignorance Devotion 's dame ;</l>
     <l n="133">Then he whom Lucifer 's own pride did swell ,</l>
     <l n="134">His faithful emissary , rose from hell</l>
     <l n="135">To possess Peter 's chair , that Hildebrand</l>
     <l n="136">Whose foot on mitres , then on crowns , did stand ;</l>
     <l n="137">And before that exalted idol all</l>
     <l n="138">( Whom we call gods on earth ) did prostrate fall . 130</l>
     <l n="139">Then darkness Europe 's face did overspread</l>
     <l n="140">From lazy cells where superstition bred ,</l>
     <l n="141">Which , link 'd with blind obedience , so increased ,</l>
     <l n="142">That the whole world some ages they oppress 'd ;</l>
     <l n="143">Till through these clouds the sun of knowledge brake ,</l>
     <l n="144">And Europe from her lethargy did wake :</l>
     <l n="145">Then first our monarchs were acknowledged here ,</l>
     <l n="146">That they their churches ’ nursing fathers were .</l>
     <l n="147">When Lucifer no longer could advance</l>
     <l n="148">His works on the false grounds of ignorance , 140</l>
     <l n="149">New arts he tries , and new designs he lays ,</l>
     <l n="150">Then his well-studied masterpiece he plays ;</l>
     <l n="151">Loyola , Luther , Calvin he inspires ,</l>
     <l n="152">And kindles with infernal flames their fires ,</l>
     <l n="153">Sends their forerunner ( conscious of th'event )</l>
     <l n="154">Printing , his most pernicious instrument !</l>
     <l n="155">Wild controversy then , which long had slept ,</l>
     <l n="156">Into the press from ruin 'd cloisters leap 'd ;</l>
     <l n="157">No longer by implicit faith we err ,</l>
     <l n="158">Whilst every man 's his own interpreter ; 150</l>
     <l n="159">No more conducted now by Aaron 's rod ,</l>
     <l n="160">Lay-elders from their ends create their god .</l>
     <l n="161">But seven wise men the ancient world did know ,</l>
     <l n="162">We scarce know seven who think themselves not so .</l>
     <l n="163">When man learn 'd undefiled religion ,</l>
     <l n="164">We were commanded to be all as one ;</l>
     <l n="165">Fiery disputes that union have calcined ;</l>
     <l n="166">Almost as many minds as men we find ,</l>
     <l n="167">And when that flame finds combustible earth ,</l>
     <l n="168">Thence fatuus fires , and meteors take their birth ; 160</l>
     <l n="169">Legions of sects and insects come in throngs ;</l>
     <l n="170">To name them all would tire a hundred tongues .</l>
     <l n="171">So were the Centaurs of Ixion 's race ,</l>
     <l n="172">Who a bright cloud for Juno did embrace ;</l>
     <l n="173">And such the monsters of Chimæra 's kind ,</l>
     <l n="174">Lions before , and dragons were behind .</l>
     <l n="175">Then from the clashes between popes and kings ,</l>
     <l n="176">Debate , like sparks from flints ’ collision , springs :</l>
     <l n="177">As Jove 's loud thunderbolts were forged by heat ,</l>
     <l n="178">The like our Cyclops on their anvils beat ; 170</l>
     <l n="179">All the rich mines of learning ransack 'd are ,</l>
     <l n="180">To furnish ammunition for this war :</l>
     <l n="181">Uncharitable zeal our reason whets ,</l>
     <l n="182">And double edges on our passion sets ;</l>
     <l n="183">‘ Tis the most certain sign the world 's accursed ,</l>
     <l n="184">That the best things corrupted are the worst ;</l>
     <l n="185">‘ Twas the corrupted light of knowledge hurl 'd</l>
     <l n="186">Sin , death , and ignorance o'er all the world ;</l>
     <l n="187">That sun like this ( from which our sight we have ) , 179</l>
     <l n="188">Gazed on too long , resumes the light he gave ;</l>
     <l n="189">And when thick mists of doubts obscure his beams ,</l>
     <l n="190">Our guide is error , and our visions , dreams ;</l>
     <l n="191">‘ Twas no false heraldry when madness drew</l>
     <l n="192">Her pedigree from those who too much knew ;</l>
     <l n="193">Who in deep mines for hidden knowledge toils ,</l>
     <l n="194">Like guns o'ercharged , breaks , misses , or recoils ;</l>
     <l n="195">When subtle wits have spun their thread too fine ,</l>
     <l n="196">‘ Tis weak and fragile , like Arachne 's line :</l>
     <l n="197">True piety , without cessation toss 'd</l>
     <l n="198">By theories , the practic part is lost , 190</l>
     <l n="199">And like a ball bandied ‘ twixt pride and wit ,</l>
     <l n="200">Rather than yield , both sides the prize will quit :</l>
     <l n="201">Then whilst his foe each gladiator foils ,</l>
     <l n="202">The atheist looking on enjoys the spoils .</l>
     <l n="203">Through seas of knowledge we our course advance ,</l>
     <l n="204">Discov'ring still new worlds of ignorance ;</l>
     <l n="205">And these discov'ries make us all confess</l>
     <l n="206">That sublunary science is but guess ;</l>
     <l n="207">Matters of fact to man are only known ,</l>
     <l n="208">And what seems more is mere opinion ; 200</l>
     <l n="209">The standers-by see clearly this event ;</l>
     <l n="210">All parties say they 're sure , yet all dissent ;</l>
     <l n="211">With their new light our bold inspectors press ,</l>
     <l n="212">Like Cham , to show their fathers ’ nakedness ,</l>
     <l n="213">By whose example after ages may</l>
     <l n="214">Discover we more naked are than they ;</l>
     <l n="215">All human wisdom to divine is folly ;</l>
     <l n="216">This truth the wisest man made melancholy ;</l>
     <l n="217">Hope , or belief , or guess , gives some relief ,</l>
     <l n="218">But to be sure we are deceived brings grief : 210</l>
     <l n="219">Who thinks his wife is virtuous , though not so ,</l>
     <l n="220">Is pleased and patient till the truth he know .</l>
     <l n="221">Our God , when heaven and earth he did create ,</l>
     <l n="222">Form 'd man who should of both participate ;</l>
     <l n="223">If our lives ’ motions theirs must imitate ,</l>
     <l n="224">Our knowledge , like our blood , must circulate .</l>
     <l n="225">When like a bridegroom from the east , the sun</l>
     <l n="226">Sets forth , he thither , whence he came , doth run ;</l>
     <l n="227">Into earth 's spongy veins the ocean sinks ,</l>
     <l n="228">Those rivers to replenish which he drinks ; 220</l>
     <l n="229">So learning , which from reason 's fountain springs ,</l>
     <l n="230">Back to the source some secret channel brings .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Reader , preserve thy peace : those busy eyes</l>
     <l n="2">Will weep at their own sad discoveries ,</l>
     <l n="3">When every line they add improves thy loss ,</l>
     <l n="4">Till , having view 'd the whole , they seem a cross ,</l>
     <l n="5">Such as derides thy passions ’ best relief ,</l>
     <l n="6">And scorns the succours of thy easy grief ;</l>
     <l n="7">Yet lest thy ignorance betray thy name</l>
     <l n="8">Of man and pious , read and mourn ; the shame</l>
     <l n="9">Of an exemption from just sense doth show</l>
     <l n="10">Irrational , beyond excess of woe . 10</l>
     <l n="11">Since reason , then , can privilege a tear ,</l>
     <l n="12">Manhood , uncensured , pay that tribute here</l>
     <l n="13">Upon this noble urn . Here , here remains</l>
     <l n="14">Dust far more precious than in India 's veins ;</l>
     <l n="15">Within those cold embraces , ravish 'd , lies</l>
     <l n="16">That which completes the age 's tyrannies ;</l>
     <l n="17">Who weak to such another ill appear ,</l>
     <l n="18">For what destroys our hope secures our fear .</l>
     <l n="19">What sin , unexpiated in this land</l>
     <l n="20">Of groans , hath guided so severe a hand ? 20</l>
     <l n="21">The late great victim<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>that your altars knew ,</l>
     <l n="22">Ye angry gods ! might have excused this new</l>
     <l n="23">Oblation , and have spared one lofty light</l>
     <l n="24">Of virtue , to inform our steps aright ;</l>
     <l n="25">By whose example good , condemnèd , we</l>
     <l n="26">Might have run on to kinder destiny .</l>
     <l n="27">But as the leader of the herd fell first</l>
     <l n="28">A sacrifice , to quench the raging thirst</l>
     <l n="29">Of inflamed vengeance for past crimes , so none</l>
     <l n="30">But this white , fatted youngling could atone , 30</l>
     <l n="31">By his untimely fate , that impious smoke ,</l>
     <l n="32">That sullied earth , and did Heaven 's pity choke .</l>
     <l n="33">Let it suffice for us that we have lost</l>
     <l n="34">In him more than the widow 'd world can boast</l>
     <l n="35">In any lump of her remaining clay .</l>
     <l n="36">Fair as the gray-eyed morn he was ; the day ,</l>
     <l n="37">Youthful , and climbing upwards still , imparts</l>
     <l n="38">No haste like that of his increasing parts .</l>
     <l n="39">Like the meridian beam , his virtue 's light</l>
     <l n="40">Was seen as full of comfort , and as bright . 40</l>
     <l n="41">Had his noon been as fixed , as clear — but he ,</l>
     <l n="42">That only wanted immortality</l>
     <l n="43">To make him perfect , now submits to night ,</l>
     <l n="44">In the black bosom of whose sable spite</l>
     <l n="45">He leaves a cloud of flesh behind , and flies ,</l>
     <l n="46">Refined , all ray and glory , to the skies .</l>
     <l n="47">Great saint ! shine there in an eternal sphere , 47</l>
     <l n="48">And tell those powers to whom thou now draw'st near ,</l>
     <l n="49">That by our trembling sense , in Hastings dead ,</l>
     <l n="50">Their anger and our ugly faults are read ,</l>
     <l n="51">The short lines of whose life did to our eyes</l>
     <l n="52">Their love and majesty epitomise ;</l>
     <l n="53">Tell them , whose stern decrees impose our laws ;</l>
     <l n="54">The feasted grave may close her hollow jaws .</l>
     <l n="55">Though Sin search Nature , to provide her here</l>

    <head>THE ARGUMENT .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">When I reflect on age , I find there are</l>
     <l n="2">Four causes , which its misery declare .</l>
     <l n="3">1 . Because our body 's strength it much impairs :</l>
     <l n="4">2 . That it takes off our minds from great affairs :</l>
     <l n="5">3 . Next , that our sense of pleasure it deprives :</l>
     <l n="6">4 . Last , that approaching death attends our lives .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Of all these sev'ral causes I 'll discourse , 109</l>
     <l n="8">And then of each , in order , weigh the force .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE FIRST PART .</head>
     <l n="1">The old from such affairs is only freed ,</l>
     <l n="2">Which vig'rous youth and strength of body need ;</l>
     <l n="3">But to more high affairs our age is lent ,</l>
     <l n="4">Most properly when heats of youth are spent .</l>
     <l n="5">Did Fabius and your father Scipio</l>
     <l n="6">( Whose daughter my son married ) nothing do ?</l>
     <l n="7">Fabricii , Coruncani , Curii ;</l>
     <l n="8">Whose courage , counsel , and authority ,</l>
     <l n="9">The Roman commonwealth restored did boast ,</l>
     <l n="10">Nor Appius , with whose strength his sight was lost , 120</l>
     <l n="11">Who when the Senate was to peace inclined</l>
     <l n="12">With Pyrrhus , shew 'd his reason was not blind ,</l>
     <l n="13">Whither 's our courage and our wisdom come</l>
     <l n="14">When Rome itself conspires the fate of Rome ?</l>
     <l n="15">The rest with ancient gravity and skill</l>
     <l n="16">He spake ( for his oration 's extant still ) .</l>
     <l n="17">‘ Tis seventeen years since he had Consul been</l>
     <l n="18">The second time , and there were ten between ;</l>
     <l n="19">Therefore their argument 's of little force ,</l>
     <l n="20">Who age from great employments would divorce . 130</l>
     <l n="21">As in a ship some climb the shrouds , t'unfold</l>
     <l n="22">The sail , some sweep the deck , some pump the hold ;</l>
     <l n="23">Whilst he that guides the helm employs his skill ,</l>
     <l n="24">And gives the law to them by sitting still .</l>
     <l n="25">Great actions less from courage , strength , and speed ,</l>
     <l n="26">Than from wise counsels and commands proceed ;</l>
     <l n="27">Those arts age wants not , which to age belong ,</l>
     <l n="28">Not heat but cold experience make us strong .</l>
     <l n="29">A Consul , Tribune , General , I have been ,</l>
     <l n="30">All sorts of war I have pass 'd through and seen ; 140</l>
     <l n="31">And now grown old , I seem t'abandon it ,</l>
     <l n="32">Yet to the Senate I prescribe what 's fit .</l>
     <l n="33">I every day ‘ gainst Carthage war proclaim ,</l>
     <l n="34">( For Rome 's destruction hath been long her aim )</l>
     <l n="35">Nor shall I cease till I her ruin see ,</l>
     <l n="36">Which triumph may the gods design for thee ;</l>
     <l n="37">That Scipio may revenge his grandsire 's ghost ,</l>
     <l n="38">Whose life at Cannæ with great honour lost</l>
     <l n="39">Is on record ; nor had he wearied been</l>
     <l n="40">With age , if he an hundred years had seen ; 150</l>
     <l n="41">He had not used excursions , spears , or darts ,</l>
     <l n="42">But counsel , order , and such aged arts ,</l>
     <l n="43">Which , if our ancestors had not retain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="44">The Senate 's name our council had not gain 'd .</l>
     <l n="45">The Spartans to their highest magistrate</l>
     <l n="46">The name of Elder did appropriate :</l>
     <l n="47">Therefore his fame for ever shall remain ,</l>
     <l n="48">How gallantly Tarentum he did gain ,</l>
     <l n="49">With vig'lant conduct ; when that sharp reply</l>
     <l n="50">He gave to Salinator , I stood by , 160</l>
     <l n="51">Who to the castle fled , the town being lost ,</l>
     <l n="52">Yet he to Maximus did vainly boast ,</l>
     <l n="53">‘ Twas by my means Tarentum you obtain 'd ;—</l>
     <l n="54">‘ Tis true , had you not lost , I had not gain 'd .</l>
     <l n="55">And as much honour on his gown did wait ,</l>
     <l n="56">As on his arms , in his fifth consulate .</l>
     <l n="57">When his colleague Carvilius stepp 'd aside ,</l>
     <l n="58">The Tribune of the people would divide</l>
     <l n="59">To them the Gallic and the Picene field ;</l>
     <l n="60">Against the Senate 's will he will not yield ; 170</l>
     <l n="61">When , being angry , boldly he declares</l>
     <l n="62">Those things were acted under happy stars ,</l>
     <l n="63">From which the commonwealth found good effects ,</l>
     <l n="64">But otherwise they came from bad aspects .</l>
     <l n="65">Many great things of Fabius I could tell ,</l>
     <l n="66">But his son 's death did all the rest excel ;</l>
     <l n="67">( His gallant son , though young , had Consul been )</l>
     <l n="68">His funeral oration I have seen</l>
     <l n="69">Often ; and when on that I turn my eyes ,</l>
     <l n="70">I all the old philosophers despise . 180</l>
     <l n="71">Though he in all the people 's eyes seem 'd great ,</l>
     <l n="72">Yet greater he appear 'd in his retreat ;</l>
     <l n="73">When feasting with his private friends at home ,</l>
     <l n="74">Such counsel , such discourse from him did come ,</l>
     <l n="75">Such science in his art of augury ,</l>
     <l n="76">No Roman ever was more learn 'd than he ;</l>
     <l n="77">Knowledge of all things present and to come ,</l>
     <l n="78">Rememb'ring all the wars of ancient Rome ,</l>
     <l n="79">Nor only there , but all the world 's beside ;</l>
     <l n="80">Dying in extreme age , I prophesied 190</l>
     <l n="81">That which is come to pass , and did discern</l>
     <l n="82">From his survivors I could nothing learn .</l>
     <l n="83">This long discourse was but to let you see</l>
     <l n="84">That his long life could not uneasy be .</l>
     <l n="85">Few like the Fabii or the Scipios are</l>
     <l n="86">Takers of cities , conquerors in war .</l>
     <l n="87">Yet others to like happy age arrive ,</l>
     <l n="88">Who modest , quiet , and with virtue live :</l>
     <l n="89">Thus Plato writing his philosophy ,</l>
     <l n="90">With honour after ninety years did die . 200</l>
     <l n="91">Th ’ Athenian story writ at ninety-four</l>
     <l n="92">By Isocrates , who yet lived five years more ;</l>
     <l n="93">His master Gorgias at the hundredth year</l>
     <l n="94">And seventh , not his studies did forbear :</l>
     <l n="95">And , ask 'd why he no sooner left the stage ?</l>
     <l n="96">Said he saw nothing to accuse old age .</l>
     <l n="97">None but the foolish , who their lives abuse ,</l>
     <l n="98">Age of their own mistakes and crimes accuse .</l>
     <l n="99">All commonwealths ( as by records is seen ) 209</l>
     <l n="100">As by age preserved , by youth destroy 'd have been .</l>
     <l n="101">When the tragedian Nævius did demand ,</l>
     <l n="102">Why did your commonwealth no longer stand ?</l>
     <l n="103">‘ Twas answer 'd , that their senators were new ,</l>
     <l n="104">Foolish , and young , and such as nothing knew ;</l>
     <l n="105">Nature to youth hot rashness doth dispense ,</l>
     <l n="106">But with cold prudence age doth recompense .</l>
     <l n="107">But age , ‘ tis said , will memory decay ,</l>
     <l n="108">So ( if it be not exercised ) it may ;</l>
     <l n="109">Or , if by nature it be dull and slow .</l>
     <l n="110">Themistocles ( when aged ) the names did know 220</l>
     <l n="111">Of all th'Athenians ; and none grow so old ,</l>
     <l n="112">Not to remember where they hid their gold .</l>
     <l n="113">From age such art of memory we learn ,</l>
     <l n="114">To forget nothing which is our concern ;</l>
     <l n="115">Their interest no priest nor sorcerer</l>
     <l n="116">Forgets , nor lawyer , nor philosopher ;</l>
     <l n="117">No understanding memory can want ,</l>
     <l n="118">Where wisdom studious industry doth plant .</l>
     <l n="119">Nor does it only in the active live ,</l>
     <l n="120">But in the quiet and contemplative ; 230</l>
     <l n="121">When Sophocles ( who plays when aged wrote )</l>
     <l n="122">Was by his sons before the judges brought ,</l>
     <l n="123">Because he paid the Muses such respect ,</l>
     <l n="124">His fortune , wife , and children to neglect ;</l>
     <l n="125">Almost condemn 'd , he moved the judges thus ,</l>
     <l n="126">‘ Hear , but instead of me , my Oedipus . ’</l>
     <l n="127">The judges hearing with applause , at th'end</l>
     <l n="128">Freed him , and said , ‘ No fool such lines had penn 'd ’ .</l>
     <l n="129">What poets and what orators can I</l>
     <l n="130">Recount , what princes in philosophy , 240</l>
     <l n="131">Whose constant studies with their age did strive ?</l>
     <l n="132">Nor did they those , though those did them survive .</l>
     <l n="133">Old husbandmen I at Sabinum know ,</l>
     <l n="134">Who for another year dig , plough , and sow .</l>
     <l n="135">For never any man was yet so old ,</l>
     <l n="136">But hoped his life one winter more might hold .</l>
     <l n="137">Cæcilius vainly said , ‘ Each day we spend</l>
     <l n="138">Discovers something , which must needs offend ; ’</l>
     <l n="139">But sometimes age may pleasant things behold ,</l>
     <l n="140">And nothing that offends . He should have told 250</l>
     <l n="141">This not to age , but youth , who oft'ner see</l>
     <l n="142">What not alone offends , but hurts , than we .</l>
     <l n="143">That , I in him , which he in age condemn 'd ,</l>
     <l n="144">That us it renders odious , and contemn 'd .</l>
     <l n="145">He knew not virtue , if he thought this truth ;</l>
     <l n="146">For youth delights in age , and age in youth .</l>
     <l n="147">What to the old can greater pleasure be ,</l>
     <l n="148">Than hopeful and ingenious youth to see ,</l>
     <l n="149">When they with rev'rence follow where we lead ,</l>
     <l n="150">And in straight paths by our directions tread ? 260</l>
     <l n="151">And e'en my conversation here I see ,</l>
     <l n="152">As well received by you , as yours by me .</l>
     <l n="153">‘ Tis disingenuous to accuse our age</l>
     <l n="154">Of idleness , who all our powers engage</l>
     <l n="155">In the same studies , the same course to hold ;</l>
     <l n="156">Nor think our reason for new arts too old .</l>
     <l n="157">Solon the sage his progress never ceased ,</l>
     <l n="158">But still his learning with his days increased ;</l>
     <l n="159">And I with the same greediness did seek ,</l>
     <l n="160">As water when I thirst , to swallow Greek ; 270</l>
     <l n="161">Which I did only learn , that I might know</l>
     <l n="162">Those great examples which I follow now :</l>
     <l n="163">And I have heard that Socrates the wise ,</l>
     <l n="164">Learn 'd on the lute for his last exercise .</l>
     <l n="165">Though many of the ancients did the same ,</l>
     <l n="166">To improve knowledge was my only aim .</l>

    <head>THE SECOND PART .</head>
     <l n="1">Now int ’ our second grievance I must break , 277</l>
     <l n="2">‘ That loss of strength makes understanding weak . ’</l>
     <l n="3">I grieve no more my youthful strength to want ,</l>
     <l n="4">Than , young , that of a bull , or elephant ;</l>
     <l n="5">Then with that force content , which Nature gave ,</l>
     <l n="6">Nor am I now displeased with what I have .</l>
     <l n="7">When the young wrestlers at their sport grew warm ,</l>
     <l n="8">Old Milo wept , to see his naked arm ;</l>
     <l n="9">And cried , ‘ twas dead . Trifler ! thine heart and head ,</l>
     <l n="10">And all that 's in them ( not thy arm ) are dead ;</l>
     <l n="11">This folly every looker on derides ,</l>
     <l n="12">To glory only in thy arms and sides .</l>
     <l n="13">Our gallant ancestors let fall no tears ,</l>
     <l n="14">Their strength decreasing by increasing years ; 290</l>
     <l n="15">But they advanced in wisdom every hour ,</l>
     <l n="16">And made the commonwealth advance in power .</l>
     <l n="17">But orators may grieve , for in their sides ,</l>
     <l n="18">Rather than heads , their faculty abides ;</l>
     <l n="19">Yet I have heard old voices loud and clear ,</l>
     <l n="20">And still my own sometimes the Senate hear .</l>
     <l n="21">When th'old with smooth and gentle voices plead ,</l>
     <l n="22">They by the ear their well-pleased audience lead :</l>
     <l n="23">Which , if I had not strength enough to do ,</l>
     <l n="24">I could ( my Lælius , and my Scipio ) 300</l>
     <l n="25">What 's to be done , or not be done , instruct ,</l>
     <l n="26">And to the maxims of good life conduct .</l>
     <l n="27">Cneius and Publius Scipio , and ( that man</l>
     <l n="28">Of men ) your grandsire , the great African ,</l>
     <l n="29">Were joyful when the flower of noble blood</l>
     <l n="30">Crowded their dwellings , and attending stood ,</l>
     <l n="31">Like oracles their counsels to receive ,</l>
     <l n="32">How in their progress they should act and live .</l>
     <l n="33">And they whose high examples youth obeys , 309</l>
     <l n="34">Are not despisèd , though their strength decays ;</l>
     <l n="35">And those decays ( to speak the naked truth ,</l>
     <l n="36">Though the defects of age ) were crimes of youth .</l>
     <l n="37">Intemp'rate youth ( by sad experience found )</l>
     <l n="38">Ends in an age imperfect and unsound .</l>
     <l n="39">Cyrus , though aged ( if Xenophon say true ) ,</l>
     <l n="40">Lucius Metellus ( whom when young I knew ) ,</l>
     <l n="41">Who held ( after his second consulate )</l>
     <l n="42">Twenty-two years the high pontificate ;</l>
     <l n="43">Neither of these in body , or in mind ,</l>
     <l n="44">Before their death the least decay did find . 320</l>
     <l n="45">I speak not of myself , though none deny</l>
     <l n="46">To age , to praise their youth the liberty :</l>
     <l n="47">Such an unwasted strength I cannot boast ,</l>
     <l n="48">Yet now my years are eighty-four almost :</l>
     <l n="49">And though from what it was my strength is far ,</l>
     <l n="50">Both in the first and second Punic war ,</l>
     <l n="51">Nor at Thermopylæ , under Glabrio ,</l>
     <l n="52">Nor when I Consul into Spain did go ;</l>
     <l n="53">But yet I feel no weakness , nor hath length</l>
     <l n="54">Of winters quite enervated my strength ; 330</l>
     <l n="55">And I , my guest , my client , or my friend ,</l>
     <l n="56">Still in the courts of justice can defend :</l>
     <l n="57">Neither must I that proverb 's truth allow ,</l>
     <l n="58">‘ Who would be ancient , must be early so . ’</l>
     <l n="59">I would be youthful still , and find no need</l>
     <l n="60">To appear old , till I was so indeed .</l>
     <l n="61">And yet you see my hours not idle are ,</l>
     <l n="62">Though with your strength I cannot mine compare ;</l>
     <l n="63">Yet this centurion 's doth your 's surmount ,</l>
     <l n="64">Not therefore him the better man I count . 340</l>
     <l n="65">Milo when ent'ring the Olympic game ,</l>
     <l n="66">With a huge ox upon his shoulder came .</l>
     <l n="67">Would you the force of Milo 's body find ,</l>
     <l n="68">Rather than of Pythagoras 's mind ?</l>
     <l n="69">The force which Nature gives with care retain ,</l>
     <l n="70">But when decay 'd , ‘ tis folly to complain .</l>
     <l n="71">In age to wish for youth is full as vain ,</l>
     <l n="72">As for a youth to turn a child again .</l>
     <l n="73">Simple and certain Nature 's ways appear ,</l>
     <l n="74">As she sets forth the seasons of the year . 350</l>
     <l n="75">So in all parts of life we find her truth ,</l>
     <l n="76">Weakness to childhood , rashness to our youth ;</l>
     <l n="77">To elder years to be discreet and grave ,</l>
     <l n="78">Then to old age maturity she gave .</l>
     <l n="79">( Scipio ) you know , how Massinissa bears</l>
     <l n="80">His kingly port at more than ninety years ;</l>
     <l n="81">When marching with his foot , he walks till night ;</l>
     <l n="82">When with his horse , he never will alight ;</l>
     <l n="83">Though cold or wet , his head is always bare ;</l>
     <l n="84">So hot , so dry , his aged members are . 360</l>
     <l n="85">You see how exercise and temperance</l>
     <l n="86">Even to old years a youthful strength advance .</l>
     <l n="87">Our law ( because from age our strength retires )</l>
     <l n="88">No duty which belongs to strength requires .</l>
     <l n="89">But age doth many men so feeble make ,</l>
     <l n="90">That they no great design can undertake ;</l>
     <l n="91">Yet that to age not singly is applied ,</l>
     <l n="92">But to all man 's infirmities beside .</l>
     <l n="93">That Scipio , who adopted you , did fall</l>
     <l n="94">Into such pains , he had no health at all ; 370</l>
     <l n="95">Who else had equall 'd Africanus ’ parts ,</l>
     <l n="96">Exceeding him in all the lib'ral arts :</l>
     <l n="97">Why should those errors then imputed be</l>
     <l n="98">To age alone , from which our youth 's not free ?</l>
     <l n="99">Every disease of age we may prevent ,</l>
     <l n="100">Like those of youth , by being diligent .</l>
     <l n="101">When sick , such mod'rate exercise we use , 377</l>
     <l n="102">And diet , as our vital heat renews ;</l>
     <l n="103">And if our body thence refreshment finds ,</l>
     <l n="104">Then must we also exercise our minds .</l>
     <l n="105">If with continual oil we not supply</l>
     <l n="106">Our lamp , the light for want of it will die ;</l>
     <l n="107">Though bodies may be tired with exercise ,</l>
     <l n="108">No weariness the mind could e'er surprise .</l>
     <l n="109">Cæcilius the comedian , when of age</l>
     <l n="110">He represents the follies on the stage ,</l>
     <l n="111">They 're credulous , forgetful , dissolute ;</l>
     <l n="112">Neither those crimes to age he doth impute ,</l>
     <l n="113">But to old men , to whom those crimes belong .</l>
     <l n="114">Lust , petulance , rashness , are in youth more strong 390</l>
     <l n="115">Than ago , and yet young men those vices hate ,</l>
     <l n="116">Who virtuous are , discreet , and temperate :</l>
     <l n="117">And so , what we call dotage seldom breeds</l>
     <l n="118">In bodies , but where nature sow 'd the seeds .</l>
     <l n="119">There are five daughters , and four gallant sons ,</l>
     <l n="120">In whom the blood of noble Appius runs ,</l>
     <l n="121">With a most num'rous family beside ,</l>
     <l n="122">Whom he alone , though old and blind , did guide .</l>
     <l n="123">Yet his clear-sighted mind was still intent ,</l>
     <l n="124">And to his business like a bow stood bent : 400</l>
     <l n="125">By children , servants , neighbours so esteem 'd ,</l>
     <l n="126">He not a master , but a monarch seem 'd .</l>
     <l n="127">All his relations his admirers were ,</l>
     <l n="128">His sons paid rev'rence , and his servants fear :</l>
     <l n="129">The order and the ancient discipline</l>
     <l n="130">Of Romans , did in all his actions shine .</l>
     <l n="131">Authority kept up old age secures ,</l>
     <l n="132">Whose dignity as long as life endures .</l>
     <l n="133">Something of youth I in old age approve ,</l>
     <l n="134">But more the marks of age in youth I love . 410</l>
     <l n="135">Who this observes may in his body find</l>
     <l n="136">Decrepit age , but never in his mind .</l>
     <l n="137">The seven volumes of my own reports ,</l>
     <l n="138">Wherein are all the pleadings of our courts ;</l>
     <l n="139">All noble monuments of Greece are come</l>
     <l n="140">Unto my hands , with those of ancient Rome .</l>
     <l n="141">The pontificial , and the civil law ,</l>
     <l n="142">I study still , and thence orations draw ;</l>
     <l n="143">And to confirm my memory , at night ,</l>
     <l n="144">What I hear , see , or do , by day , recite . 420</l>
     <l n="145">These exercises for my thoughts I find ;</l>
     <l n="146">These labours are the chariots of my mind .</l>
     <l n="147">To serve my friends , the Senate I frequent ,</l>
     <l n="148">And there what I before digested vent ;</l>
     <l n="149">Which only from my strength of mind proceeds ,</l>
     <l n="150">Not any outward force of body needs ;</l>
     <l n="151">Which , if I could not do , I should delight</l>
     <l n="152">On what I would to ruminate at night .</l>
     <l n="153">Who in such practices their minds engage ,</l>
     <l n="154">Nor fear nor think of their approaching age , 430</l>
     <l n="155">Which by degrees invisibly doth creep :</l>

    <head>THE THIRD PART .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Now must I draw my forces ‘ gainst that host</l>
     <l n="2">Of pleasures , which i ’ th'sea of age are lost .</l>
     <l n="3">O thou most high transcendant gift of age !</l>
     <l n="4">Youth from its folly thus to disengage .</l>
     <l n="5">And now receive from me that most divine</l>
     <l n="6">Oration of that noble Tarentine ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></l>
     <l n="7">Which at Tarentum I long since did hear ,</l>
     <l n="8">When I attended the great Fabius there . 440</l>
     <l n="9">Ye gods , was it man 's nature , or his fate ,</l>
     <l n="10">Betray 'd him with sweet pleasure 's poison 'd bait ?</l>
     <l n="11">Which he , with all designs of art or power ,</l>
     <l n="12">Doth with unbridled appetite devour :</l>
     <l n="13">And as all poisons seek the noblest part ,</l>
     <l n="14">Pleasure possesses first the head and heart ;</l>
     <l n="15">Intoxicating both by them , she finds ,</l>
     <l n="16">And burns the sacred temples of our minds .</l>
     <l n="17">Furies , which reason 's divine chains had bound ,</l>
     <l n="18">( That being broken ) all the world confound . 450</l>
     <l n="19">Lust , murder , treason , avarice , and hell</l>
     <l n="20">Itself broke loose , in reason 's palace dwell :</l>
     <l n="21">Truth , honour , justice , temperance , are fled ,</l>
     <l n="22">All her attendants into darkness led .</l>
     <l n="23">But why all this discourse ? when pleasure 's rage</l>
     <l n="24">Hath conquer 'd reason , we must treat with age .</l>
     <l n="25">Age undermines , and will in time surprise</l>
     <l n="26">Her strongest forts , and cut off all supplies ;</l>
     <l n="27">And join 'd in league with strong necessity ,</l>
     <l n="28">Pleasure must fly , or else by famine die . 460</l>
     <l n="29">Flaminius , whom a consulship had graced ,</l>
     <l n="30">( Then Censor ) from the Senate I displaced ;</l>
     <l n="31">When he in Gaul , a Consul , made a feast ,</l>
     <l n="32">A beauteous courtesan did him request</l>
     <l n="33">To see the cutting off a pris'ner ' s head ;</l>
     <l n="34">This crime I could not leave unpunished ,</l>
     <l n="35">Since by a private villany he stain 'd</l>
     <l n="36">That public honour which at Rome he gain 'd .</l>
     <l n="37">Then to our age ( when not to pleasures bent )</l>
     <l n="38">This seems an honour , not disparagement . 470</l>
     <l n="39">We not all pleasures like the Stoics hate ,</l>
     <l n="40">But love and seek those which are moderate .</l>
     <l n="41">( Though divine Plato thus of pleasures thought ,</l>
     <l n="42">They us , with hooks and baits , like fishes caught . )</l>
     <l n="43">When Questor , to the gods in public halls</l>
     <l n="44">I was the first who set up festivals .</l>
     <l n="45">Not with high tastes our appetites did force ,</l>
     <l n="46">But fill 'd with conversation and discourse ;</l>
     <l n="47">Which feasts , Convivial Meetings we did name :</l>
     <l n="48">Not like the ancient Greeks , who to their shame , 480</l>
     <l n="49">Call 'd it a Compotation , not a feast ;</l>
     <l n="50">Declaring the worst part of it the best .</l>
     <l n="51">Those entertainments I did then frequent</l>
     <l n="52">Sometimes with youthful heat and merriment :</l>
     <l n="53">But now I thank my age , which gives me ease</l>
     <l n="54">From those excesses ; yet myself I please</l>
     <l n="55">With cheerful talk to entertain my guests</l>
     <l n="56">( Discourses are to age continual feasts ) ,</l>
     <l n="57">The love of meat and wine they recompense ,</l>
     <l n="58">And cheer the mind , as much as those the sense . 490</l>
     <l n="59">I 'm not more pleased with gravity among</l>
     <l n="60">The aged , than to be youthful with the young ;</l>
     <l n="61">Nor ‘ gainst all pleasures proclaim open war ,</l>
     <l n="62">To which , in age , some nat'ral motions are .</l>
     <l n="63">And still at my Sabinum I delight</l>
     <l n="64">To treat my neighbours till the depth of night .</l>
     <l n="65">But we the sense of gust and pleasure want ,</l>
     <l n="66">Which youth at full possesses ; this I grant ;</l>
     <l n="67">But age seeks not the things which youth requires ,</l>
     <l n="68">And no man needs that which he not desires . 500</l>
     <l n="69">When Sophocles was asked if he denied</l>
     <l n="70">Himself the use of pleasures , he replied ,</l>
     <l n="71">‘ I humbly thank th'immortal gods , who me</l>
     <l n="72">From that fierce tyrant 's insolence set free . ’</l>
     <l n="73">But they whom pressing appetites constrain ,</l>
     <l n="74">Grieve when they cannot their desires obtain .</l>
     <l n="75">Young men the use of pleasure understand ,</l>
     <l n="76">As of an object new , and near at hand :</l>
     <l n="77">Though this stands more remote from age 's sight , 509</l>
     <l n="78">Yet they behold it not without delight :</l>
     <l n="79">As ancient soldiers , from their duties eased ,</l>
     <l n="80">With sense of honour and rewards are pleased ;</l>
     <l n="81">So from ambitious hopes and lusts released ,</l>
     <l n="82">Delighted with itself our age doth rest .</l>
     <l n="83">No part of life 's more happy , when with bread</l>
     <l n="84">Of ancient knowledge and new learning fed ;</l>
     <l n="85">All youthful pleasures by degrees must cease ,</l>
     <l n="86">But those of age even with our years increase .</l>
     <l n="87">We love not loaded boards and goblets crown 'd ,</l>
     <l n="88">But free from surfeits our repose is sound . 520</l>
     <l n="89">When old Fabricius to the Samnites went</l>
     <l n="90">Ambassador , from Rome to Pyrrhus sent ,</l>
     <l n="91">He heard a grave philosopher maintain ,</l>
     <l n="92">That all the actions of our life were vain</l>
     <l n="93">Which with our sense of pleasure not conspired ;</l>
     <l n="94">Fabricius the philosopher desired ,</l>
     <l n="95">That he to Pyrrhus would that maxim teach ,</l>
     <l n="96">And to the Samnites the same doctrine preach ;</l>
     <l n="97">Then of their conquest he should doubt no more ,</l>
     <l n="98">Whom their own pleasures overcame before . 530</l>
     <l n="99">Now into rustic matters I must fall ,</l>
     <l n="100">Which pleasure seems to me the chief of all .</l>
     <l n="101">Age no impediment to those can give ,</l>
     <l n="102">Who wisely by the rules of Nature live .</l>
     <l n="103">Earth ( though our mother ) cheerfully obeys</l>
     <l n="104">All the commands her race upon her lays .</l>
     <l n="105">For whatsoever from our hand she takes ,</l>
     <l n="106">Greater or less , a vast return she makes .</l>
     <l n="107">Nor am I only pleased with that resource ,</l>
     <l n="108">But with her ways , her method , and her force . 540</l>
     <l n="109">The seed her bosom ( by the plough made fit )</l>
     <l n="110">Receives , where kindly she embraces it ,</l>
     <l n="111">Which with her genuine warmth diffused and spread ,</l>
     <l n="112">Sends forth betimes a green and tender head ,</l>
     <l n="113">Then gives it motion , life , and nourishment ,</l>
     <l n="114">Which from the root through nerves and veins are sent ;</l>
     <l n="115">Straight in a hollow sheath upright it grows ,</l>
     <l n="116">And , form receiving , doth itself disclose :</l>
     <l n="117">Drawn up in ranks and files , the bearded spikes</l>
     <l n="118">Guard it from birds as with a stand of pikes . 550</l>
     <l n="119">When of the vine I speak , I seem inspired ,</l>
     <l n="120">And with delight , as with her juice , am fired ;</l>
     <l n="121">At Nature 's godlike power I stand amazed ,</l>
     <l n="122">Which such vast bodies hath from atoms raised .</l>
     <l n="123">The kernel of a grape , the fig 's small grain ,</l>
     <l n="124">Can clothe a mountain and o'ershade a plain :</l>
     <l n="125">But thou , ( dear Vine ! ) forbid'st me to be long ;</l>
     <l n="126">Although thy trunk be neither large nor strong ,</l>
     <l n="127">Nor can thy head ( not help 'd ) itself sublime ,</l>
     <l n="128">Yet , like a serpent , a tall tree can climb ; 560</l>
     <l n="129">Whate'er thy many fingers can entwine ,</l>
     <l n="130">Proves thy support , and all its strength is thine .</l>
     <l n="131">Though Nature gave not legs , it gave the hands ,</l>
     <l n="132">By which thy prop the proudest cedar stands :</l>
     <l n="133">As thou hast hands , so hath thy offspring wings ,</l>
     <l n="134">And to the highest part of mortals springs .</l>
     <l n="135">But lest thou should'st consume thy wealth in vain ,</l>
     <l n="136">And starve thyself to feed a num'rous train ,</l>
     <l n="137">Or like the bee ( sweet as thy blood ) design 'd</l>
     <l n="138">To be destroy 'd to propagate his kind , 570</l>
     <l n="139">Lest thy redundant and superfluous juice ,</l>
     <l n="140">Should fading leaves instead of fruits produce ,</l>
     <l n="141">The pruner 's hand , with letting blood , must quench</l>
     <l n="142">Thy heat , and thy exub'rant parts retrench :</l>
     <l n="143">Then from the joints of thy prolific stem</l>
     <l n="144">A swelling knot is raisèd ( call 'd a gem ) ,</l>
     <l n="145">Whence , in short space , itself the cluster shows , 577</l>
     <l n="146">And from earth 's moisture mixed with sunbeams grows .</l>
     <l n="147">I ’ th'spring , like youth , it yields an acid taste ,</l>
     <l n="148">But summer doth , like age , the sourness waste ;</l>
     <l n="149">Then clothed with leaves , from heat and cold secure ,</l>
     <l n="150">Like virgins , sweet and beauteous , when mature .</l>
     <l n="151">On fruits , flowers , herbs , and plants , I long could dwell ,</l>
     <l n="152">At once to please my eye , my taste , my smell ;</l>
     <l n="153">My walks of trees , all planted by my hand ,</l>
     <l n="154">Like children of my own begetting stand .</l>
     <l n="155">To tell the sev'ral natures of each earth ,</l>
     <l n="156">What fruits from each most properly take birth :</l>
     <l n="157">And with what arts to enrich every mould ,</l>
     <l n="158">The dry to moisten , and to warm the cold . 590</l>
     <l n="159">But when we graft , or buds inoculate ,</l>
     <l n="160">Nature by art we nobly meliorate ;</l>
     <l n="161">As Orpheus ’ music wildest beasts did tame ,</l>
     <l n="162">From the sour crab the sweetest apple came :</l>
     <l n="163">The mother to the daughter goes to school ,</l>
     <l n="164">The species changed , doth her law overrule ;</l>
     <l n="165">Nature herself doth from herself depart ,</l>
     <l n="166">( Strange transmigration ! ) by the power of art .</l>
     <l n="167">How little things give law to great ! we see</l>
     <l n="168">The small bud captivates the greatest tree . 600</l>
     <l n="169">Here even the power divine we imitate ,</l>
     <l n="170">And seem not to beget , but to create .</l>
     <l n="171">Much was I pleased with fowls and beasts , the tame</l>
     <l n="172">For food and profit , and the wild for game .</l>
     <l n="173">Excuse me when this pleasant string I touch</l>
     <l n="174">( For age , of what delights it , speaks too much ) .</l>
     <l n="175">Who twice victorious Pyrrhus conquered ,</l>
     <l n="176">The Sabines and the Samnites captive led ,</l>
     <l n="177">Great Curius , his remaining days did spend ,</l>
     <l n="178">And in this happy life his triumphs end . 610</l>
     <l n="179">My farm stands near , and when I there retire ,</l>
     <l n="180">His , and that age 's temper I admire :</l>
     <l n="181">The Samnites ’ chief , as by his fire he sate ,</l>
     <l n="182">With a vast sum of gold on him did wait ;</l>
     <l n="183">‘ Return , ’ said he , ‘ your gold I nothing weigh ,</l>
     <l n="184">When those who can command it me obey . ’</l>
     <l n="185">This my assertion proves , he may be old ,</l>
     <l n="186">And yet not sordid , who refuses gold .</l>
     <l n="187">In summer to sit still , or walk , I love ,</l>
     <l n="188">Near a cool fountain , or a shady grove . 620</l>
     <l n="189">What can in winter render more delight ,</l>
     <l n="190">Than the high sun at noon , and fire at night ?</l>
     <l n="191">While our old friends and neighbours feast and play ,</l>
     <l n="192">And with their harmless mirth turn night to day ,</l>
     <l n="193">Unpurchased plenty our full tables loads ,</l>
     <l n="194">And part of what they lent , return t'our gods .</l>
     <l n="195">That honour and authority which dwells</l>
     <l n="196">With age , all pleasures of our youth excels .</l>
     <l n="197">Observe , that I that age have only praised</l>
     <l n="198">Whose pillars were on youth 's foundations raised , 630</l>
     <l n="199">And that ( for which I great applause received )</l>
     <l n="200">As a true maxim hath been since believed .</l>
     <l n="201">That most unhappy age great pity needs ,</l>
     <l n="202">Which to defend itself , new matter pleads ;</l>
     <l n="203">Not from gray hairs authority doth flow ,</l>
     <l n="204">Nor from bald heads , nor from a wrinkled brow ,</l>
     <l n="205">But our past life , when virtuously spent ,</l>
     <l n="206">Must to our age those happy fruits present .</l>
     <l n="207">Those things to age most honourable are ,</l>
     <l n="208">Which easy , common , and but light appear , 640</l>
     <l n="209">Salutes , consulting , compliment , resort ,</l>
     <l n="210">Crowding attendance to and from the court :</l>
     <l n="211">And not on Rome alone this honour waits ,</l>
     <l n="212">But on all civil and well-govern 'd states .</l>
     <l n="213">Lysander , pleading in his city 's praise ,</l>
     <l n="214">From thence his strongest argument did raise ,</l>
     <l n="215">That Sparta did with honour age support ,</l>
     <l n="216">Paying them just respect at stage and court .</l>
     <l n="217">But at proud Athens youth did age outface ,</l>
     <l n="218">Nor at the plays would rise , or give them place . 650</l>
     <l n="219">When an Athenian stranger of great age</l>
     <l n="220">Arrived at Sparta , climbing up the stage ,</l>
     <l n="221">To him the whole assembly rose , and ran</l>
     <l n="222">To place and ease this old and rev'rend man ,</l>
     <l n="223">Who thus his thanks returns , ‘ Th ’ Athenians know</l>
     <l n="224">What 's to be done , but what they know not do . ’</l>
     <l n="225">Here our great Senate 's orders I may quote ,</l>
     <l n="226">The first in age is still the first in vote .</l>
     <l n="227">Nor honour , nor high birth , nor great command ,</l>
     <l n="228">In competition with great years may stand . 660</l>
     <l n="229">Why should our youth 's short , transient , pleasures dare</l>
     <l n="230">With age 's lasting honours to compare ?</l>
     <l n="231">On the world 's stage , when our applause grows high ,</l>
     <l n="232">For acting here life 's tragic-comedy ,</l>
     <l n="233">The lookers-on will say we act not well ,</l>
     <l n="234">Unless the last the former scenes excel :</l>
     <l n="235">But age is froward , uneasy , scrutinous ,</l>
     <l n="236">Hard to be pleased , and parsimonious ;</l>
     <l n="237">But all those errors from our manners rise ,</l>
     <l n="238">Not from our years ; yet some morosities 670</l>
     <l n="239">We must expect , since jealousy belongs</l>
     <l n="240">To age , of scorn , and tender sense of wrongs :</l>
     <l n="241">Yet these are mollified , or not discern 'd ,</l>
     <l n="242">Where civil arts and manners have been learn 'd :</l>
     <l n="243">So the Twins ’ humours ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>in our Terence , are</l>
     <l n="244">Unlike-this harsh and rude , that smooth and fair .</l>
     <l n="245">Our nature here is not unlike our wine , 677</l>
     <l n="246">Some sorts , when old , continue brisk and fine ;</l>
     <l n="247">So age 's gravity may seem severe ,</l>
     <l n="248">But nothing harsh or bitter ought t'appear .</l>
     <l n="249">Of age 's avarice I cannot see</l>
     <l n="250">What colour , ground , or reason there should be :</l>
     <l n="251">Is it not folly , when the way we ride</l>
     <l n="252">Is short , for a long voyage to provide ?</l>
     <l n="253">To avarice some title youth may own ,</l>
     <l n="254">To reap in autumn what the spring had sown ;</l>
     <l n="255">And , with the providence of bees , or ants ,</l>
     <l n="256">Prevent with summer 's plenty winter 's wants .</l>
     <l n="257">But age scarce sows till death stands by to reap ,</l>
     <l n="258">And to a stranger 's hand transfers the heap ; 690</l>
     <l n="259">Afraid to be so once , she 's always poor ,</l>
     <l n="260">And to avoid a mischief makes it sure .</l>
     <l n="261">Such madness , as for fear of death to die ,</l>
     <l n="262">Is to be poor for fear of poverty .</l>

     <l n="4">The hungry grave for her due tribute gapes .</l>
     <l n="5">Fond , foolish man ! with fear of death surprised ,</l>
     <l n="6">Which either should be wish 'd for , or despised ; 700</l>
     <l n="7">This , if our souls with bodies death destroy ;</l>
     <l n="8">That , if our souls a second life enjoy .</l>
     <l n="9">What else is to be fear 'd , when we shall gain</l>
     <l n="10">Eternal life , or have no sense of pain ?</l>
     <l n="11">The youngest in the morning are not sure</l>
     <l n="12">That till the night their life they can secure ;</l>
     <l n="13">Their age stands more exposed to accidents</l>
     <l n="14">Than ours , nor common care their fate prevents :</l>
     <l n="15">Death 's force ( with terror ) against Nature strives , 709</l>
     <l n="16">Nor one of many to ripe age arrives .</l>
     <l n="17">From this ill fate the world 's disorders rise ,</l>
     <l n="18">For if all men were old , they would be wise ;</l>
     <l n="19">Years and experience our forefathers taught ,</l>
     <l n="20">Them under laws and into cities brought :</l>
     <l n="21">Why only should the fear of death belong</l>
     <l n="22">To age , which is as common to the young ?</l>
     <l n="23">Your hopeful brothers , and my son , to you</l>
     <l n="24">( Scipio ) and me , this maxim makes too true :</l>
     <l n="25">But vig'rous youth may his gay thoughts erect</l>
     <l n="26">To many years , which age must not expect . 720</l>
     <l n="27">But when he sees his airy hopes deceived ,</l>
     <l n="28">With grief he says , Who this would have believed ?</l>
     <l n="29">We happier are than they , who but desired</l>
     <l n="30">To possess that which we long since acquired .</l>
     <l n="31">What if our age to Nestor 's could extend ?</l>
     <l n="32">‘ Tis vain to think that lasting which must end ;</l>
     <l n="33">And when ‘ tis past , not any part remains</l>
     <l n="34">Thereof , but the reward which virtue gains .</l>
     <l n="35">Days , months , and years , like running waters flow ,</l>
     <l n="36">Nor what is past , nor what 's to come , we know : 730</l>
     <l n="37">Our date , how short soe'er , must us content .</l>
     <l n="38">When a good actor doth his part present ,</l>
     <l n="39">In every act he our attention draws ,</l>
     <l n="40">That at the last he may find just applause ;</l>
     <l n="41">So ( though but short ) yet we must learn the art</l>
     <l n="42">Of virtue , on the stage to act our part ;</l>
     <l n="43">True wisdom must our actions so direct ,</l>
     <l n="44">Not only the last plaudit to expect ;</l>
     <l n="45">Yet grieve no more , though long that part should last ,</l>
     <l n="46">Than husbandmen , because the spring is past . 740</l>
     <l n="47">The spring , like youth , fresh blossoms doth produce ,</l>
     <l n="48">But autumn makes them ripe and fit for use :</l>
     <l n="49">So age a mature mellowness doth set</l>
     <l n="50">On the green promises of youthful heat .</l>
     <l n="51">All things which Nature did ordain , are good ,</l>
     <l n="52">And so must be received and understood .</l>
     <l n="53">Age , like ripe apples , on earth 's bosom drops ,</l>
     <l n="54">While force our youth , like fruits untimely , crops ;</l>
     <l n="55">The sparkling flame of our warm blood expires ,</l>
     <l n="56">As when huge streams are pour 'd on raging fires ; 750</l>
     <l n="57">But age unforced falls by her own consent ,</l>
     <l n="58">As coals to ashes , when the spirit 's spent ;</l>
     <l n="59">Therefore to death I with such joy resort ,</l>
     <l n="60">As seamen from a tempest to their port .</l>
     <l n="61">Yet to that port ourselves we must not force ,</l>
     <l n="62">Before our pilot , Nature , steers our course .</l>
     <l n="63">Let us the causes of our fear condemn ,</l>
     <l n="64">Then Death at his approach we shall contemn .</l>
     <l n="65">Though to our heat of youth our age seems cold ,</l>
     <l n="66">Yet when resolved , it is more brave and bold . 760</l>
     <l n="67">Thus Solon to Pisistratus replied ,</l>
     <l n="68">Demanded , on what succour he relied ,</l>
     <l n="69">When with so few he boldly did engage ?</l>
     <l n="70">He said , he took his courage from his age .</l>
     <l n="71">Then death seems welcome , and our nature kind ,</l>
     <l n="72">When , leaving us a perfect sense and mind ,</l>
     <l n="73">She ( like a workman in his science skill 'd )</l>
     <l n="74">Pulls down with ease what her own hand did build .</l>
     <l n="75">That art which knew to join all parts in one ,</l>
     <l n="76">Makes the least vi'lent separation . 770</l>
     <l n="77">Yet though our ligaments betimes grow weak ,</l>
     <l n="78">We must not force them till themselves they break .</l>
     <l n="79">Pythagoras bids us in our station stand ,</l>
     <l n="80">Till God , our general , shall us disband .</l>
     <l n="81">Wise Solon dying , wish 'd his friends might grieve ,</l>
     <l n="82">That in their memories he still might live .</l>
     <l n="83">Yet wiser Ennius gave command to all 777</l>
     <l n="84">His friends not to bewail his funeral ;</l>
     <l n="85">Your tears for such a death in vain you spend ,</l>
     <l n="86">Which straight in immortality shall end .</l>
     <l n="87">In death , if there be any sense of pain ,</l>
     <l n="88">But a short space to age it will remain ;</l>
     <l n="89">On which , without my fears , my wishes wait ,</l>
     <l n="90">But tim'rous youth on this should meditate :</l>
     <l n="91">Who for light pleasure this advice rejects ,</l>
     <l n="92">Finds little , when his thoughts he recollects .</l>
     <l n="93">Our death ( though not its certain date ) we know ;</l>
     <l n="94">Nor whether it may be this night , or no :</l>
     <l n="95">How then can they contented live , who fear</l>
     <l n="96">A danger certain , and none knows how near ? 790</l>
     <l n="97">They err , who for the fear of death dispute ,</l>
     <l n="98">Our gallant actions this mistake confute .</l>
     <l n="99">Thee , Brutus ! Rome 's first martyr I must name ;</l>
     <l n="100">The Curtii bravely dived the gulf of flame :</l>
     <l n="101">Attilius sacrificed himself , to save</l>
     <l n="102">That faith , which to his barb'rous foes he gave ;</l>
     <l n="103">With the two Scipios did thy uncle fall ,</l>
     <l n="104">Rather than fly from conqu'ring Hannibal .</l>
     <l n="105">The great Marcellus ( who restorèd Rome )</l>
     <l n="106">His greatest foes with honour did entomb . 800</l>
     <l n="107">Their lives how many of our legions threw</l>
     <l n="108">Into the breach , whence no return they knew ?</l>
     <l n="109">Must then the wise , the old , the learned fear ,</l>
     <l n="110">What not the rude , the young , th'unlearn ' d forbear ?</l>
     <l n="111">Satiety from all things else doth come ,</l>
     <l n="112">Then life must to itself grow wearisome .</l>
     <l n="113">Those trifles wherein children take delight ,</l>
     <l n="114">Grow nauseous to the young man 's appetite ;</l>
     <l n="115">And from those gaieties our youth requires</l>
     <l n="116">To exercise their minds , our age retires . 810</l>
     <l n="117">And when the last delights of age shall die ,</l>
     <l n="118">Life in itself will find satiety .</l>
     <l n="119">Now you ( my friends ) my sense of death shall hear ,</l>
     <l n="120">Which I can well describe , for he stands near .</l>
     <l n="121">Your father , Lælius , and your 's , Scipio ,</l>
     <l n="122">My friends , and men of honour , I did know ;</l>
     <l n="123">As certainly as we must die , they live</l>
     <l n="124">That life which justly may that name receive :</l>
     <l n="125">Till from these prisons of our flesh released ,</l>
     <l n="126">Our souls with heavy burdens lie oppress 'd ; 820</l>
     <l n="127">Which part of man from heaven falling down ,</l>
     <l n="128">Earth , in her low abyss , doth hide and drown ,</l>
     <l n="129">A place so dark to the celestial light ,</l>
     <l n="130">And pure , eternal fire 's quite opposite ,</l>
     <l n="131">The gods through human bodies did disperse</l>
     <l n="132">An heavenly soul , to guide this universe ,</l>
     <l n="133">That man , when he of heavenly bodies saw</l>
     <l n="134">The order , might from thence a pattern draw :</l>
     <l n="135">Nor this to me did my own dictates show ,</l>
     <l n="136">But to the old philosophers I owe . 830</l>
     <l n="137">I heard Pythagoras , and those who came</l>
     <l n="138">With him , and from our country took their name ;</l>
     <l n="139">Who never doubted but the beams divine ,</l>
     <l n="140">Derived from gods , in mortal breasts did shine .</l>
     <l n="141">Nor from my knowledge did the ancients hide</l>
     <l n="142">What Socrates declared the hour he died ;</l>
     <l n="143">He th'immortality of souls proclaim 'd ,</l>
     <l n="144">( Whom th'oracle of men the wisest named )</l>
     <l n="145">Why should we doubt of that whereof our sense</l>
     <l n="146">Finds demonstration from experience ? 840</l>
     <l n="147">Our minds are here , and there , below , above ;</l>
     <l n="148">Nothing that 's mortal can so swiftly move .</l>
     <l n="149">Our thoughts to future things their flight direct ,</l>
     <l n="150">And in an instant all that 's past collect .</l>
     <l n="151">Reason , remembrance , wit , inventive art ,</l>
     <l n="152">No nature , but immortal , can impart .</l>
     <l n="153">Man 's soul in a perpetual motion flows ,</l>
     <l n="154">And to no outward cause that motion owes ;</l>
     <l n="155">And therefore that no end can overtake ,</l>
     <l n="156">Because our minds cannot themselves forsake . 850</l>
     <l n="157">And since the matter of our soul is pure</l>
     <l n="158">And simple , which no mixture can endure</l>
     <l n="159">Of parts , which not among themselves agree ;</l>
     <l n="160">Therefore it never can divided be .</l>
     <l n="161">And Nature shows ( without philosophy )</l>
     <l n="162">What cannot be divided , cannot die .</l>
     <l n="163">We even in early infancy discern</l>
     <l n="164">Knowledge is born with babes before they learn ;</l>
     <l n="165">Ere they can speak they find so many ways</l>
     <l n="166">To serve their turn , and see more arts than days : 860</l>
     <l n="167">Before their thoughts they plainly can express ,</l>
     <l n="168">The words and things they know are numberless ;</l>
     <l n="169">Which Nature only and no art could find ,</l>
     <l n="170">But what she taught before , she call 'd to mind ,</l>
     <l n="171">These to his sons ( as Xenophon records )</l>
     <l n="172">Of the great Cyrus were the dying words ;</l>
     <l n="173">‘ Fear not when I depart ( nor therefore mourn )</l>
     <l n="174">I shall be nowhere , or to nothing turn :</l>
     <l n="175">That soul which gave me life , was seen by none ,</l>
     <l n="176">Yet by the actions it design 'd was known ; 870</l>
     <l n="177">And though its flight no mortal eye shall see ,</l>
     <l n="178">Yet know , for ever it the same shall be .</l>
     <l n="179">That soul which can immortal glory give</l>
     <l n="180">To her own virtues must for ever live .</l>
     <l n="181">Can you believe that man 's all-knowing mind</l>
     <l n="182">Can to a mortal body be confined ?</l>
     <l n="183">Though a foul foolish prison her immure</l>
     <l n="184">On earth , she ( when escaped ) is wise and pure .</l>
     <l n="185">Man 's body when dissolved is but the same 879</l>
     <l n="186">With beasts , and must return from whence it came ;</l>
     <l n="187">But whence into our bodies reason flows ,</l>
     <l n="188">None sees it when it comes , or where it goes .</l>
     <l n="189">Nothing resembles death so much as sleep ,</l>
     <l n="190">Yet then our minds themselves from slumber keep .</l>
     <l n="191">When from their fleshly bondage they are free ,</l>
     <l n="192">Then what divine and future things they see !</l>
     <l n="193">Which makes it most apparent whence they are ,</l>
     <l n="194">And what they shall hereafter be , declare . ’</l>
     <l n="195">This noble speech the dying Cyrus made .</l>
     <l n="196">Me ( Scipio ) shall no argument persuade , 890</l>
     <l n="197">Thy grandsire , and his brother , to whom Fame</l>
     <l n="198">Gave , from two conquer 'd parts o ’ th'world , their name ,</l>
     <l n="199">Nor thy great grandsire , nor thy father Paul ,</l>
     <l n="200">Who fell at Cannæ against Hannibal ;</l>
     <l n="201">Nor I ( for ‘ tis permitted to the aged</l>
     <l n="202">To boast their actions ) had so oft engaged</l>
     <l n="203">In battles , and in pleadings , had we thought ,</l>
     <l n="204">That only fame our virtuous actions bought ;</l>
     <l n="205">‘ Twere better in soft pleasure and repose</l>
     <l n="206">Ingloriously our peaceful eyes to close : 900</l>
     <l n="207">Some high assurance hath possess 'd my mind ,</l>
     <l n="208">After my death an happier life to find .</l>
     <l n="209">Unless our souls from the immortals came ,</l>
     <l n="210">What end have we to seek immortal fame ?</l>
     <l n="211">All virtuous spirits some such hope attends ,</l>
     <l n="212">Therefore the wise his days with pleasure ends .</l>
     <l n="213">The foolish and short-sighted die with fear ,</l>
     <l n="214">That they go nowhere , or they know not where .</l>
     <l n="215">The wise and virtuous soul , with clearer eyes ,</l>
     <l n="216">Before she parts , some happy port descries . 910</l>
     <l n="217">My friends , your fathers I shall surely see :</l>
     <l n="218">Nor only those I loved , or who loved me ,</l>
     <l n="219">But such as before ours did end their days ,</l>
     <l n="220">Of whom we hear , and read , and write their praise .</l>
     <l n="221">This I believe ; for were I on my way ,</l>
     <l n="222">None should persuade me to return , or stay :</l>
     <l n="223">Should some god tell me that I should be born</l>
     <l n="224">And cry again , his offer I would scorn ;</l>
     <l n="225">Asham 'd , when I have ended well my race ,</l>
     <l n="226">To be led back to my first starting-place . 920</l>
     <l n="227">And since with life we are more grieved than joy 'd ,</l>
     <l n="228">We should be either satisfied or cloy 'd :</l>
     <l n="229">Yet will I not my length of days deplore ,</l>
     <l n="230">As many wise and learn 'd have done before :</l>
     <l n="231">Nor can I think such life in vain is lent ,</l>
     <l n="232">Which for our country and our friends is spent .</l>
     <l n="233">Hence from an inn , not from my home , I pass ,</l>
     <l n="234">Since Nature meant us here no dwelling-place .</l>
     <l n="235">Happy when I , from this turmoil set free ,</l>
     <l n="236">That peaceful and divine assembly see : 930</l>
     <l n="237">Not only those I named I there shall greet ,</l>
     <l n="238">But my own gallant virtuous Cato meet .</l>
     <l n="239">Nor did I weep , when I to ashes turn 'd</l>
     <l n="240">His belov 'd body , who should mine have burn 'd .</l>
     <l n="241">I in my thoughts beheld his soul ascend ,</l>
     <l n="242">Where his fixed hopes our interview attend :</l>
     <l n="243">Then cease to wonder that I feel no grief</l>
     <l n="244">From age , which is of my delights the chief .</l>
     <l n="245">My hopes if this assurance hath deceived</l>
     <l n="246">( That I man 's soul immortal have believed ) , 940</l>
     <l n="247">And if I err , no power shall dispossess</l>
     <l n="248">My thoughts of that expected happiness ,</l>
     <l n="249">Though some minute philosophers pretend ,</l>
     <l n="250">That with our days our pains and pleasures end .</l>
     <l n="251">If it be so , I hold the safer side ,</l>
     <l n="252">For none of them my error shall deride .</l>
     <l n="253">And if hereafter no rewards appear , 947</l>
     <l n="254">Yet virtue hath itself rewarded here .</l>
     <l n="255">If those who this opinion have despised ,</l>
     <l n="256">And their whole life to pleasure sacrificed ,</l>
     <l n="257">Should feel their error , they , when undeceived ,</l>
     <l n="258">Too late will wish that me they had believed .</l>
     <l n="259">If souls no immortality obtain ,</l>
     <l n="260">‘ Tis fit our bodies should be out of pain .</l>
     <l n="261">The same uneasiness which everything</l>
     <l n="262">Gives to our nature , life must also bring .</l>
     <l n="263">Good acts , if long , seem tedious ; so is age ,</l>
     <l n="264">Acting too long upon this earth her stage .—</l>
     <l n="265">Thus much for age , to which when you arrive ,</l>
     <l n="266">That joy to you , which it gives me , ‘ twill give . 960</l>
