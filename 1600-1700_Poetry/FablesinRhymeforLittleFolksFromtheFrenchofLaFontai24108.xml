   <p>La Fontaine composed the most entertaining Fables ever written in any language , and made them a model of literary perfection ; yet our translators and compilers have somehow neglected him . His Fables are lyric poetry of a high order , and this alone has doubtless been a barrier to a better acquaintance with his work when transferred to our own tongue . Done into prose , the Fables are no longer La Fontaine , but take their place with the many respectable , dull translations which English readers try to admire because they are classics — though the soul that made them such has been separated from the dead body .</p>
   <p>It has seemed to me that while the full enjoyment of La Fontaine must always be reserved for those who can read him in French , it might be possible at least to convey something of his originality and blithe spirit through the medium of light verse . In making the attempt I am fully aware of my temerity , and the criticism it will invite . To excuse the one and to meet the other I have taken refuge in the term “ adaptation ” — even though the word applies only in part to my paraphrases . Some of the Fables in this book are translations in a true sense , and keep closely to the text . From others I have erased such political , mythological and literary allusions ( in which La Fontaine abounds ) as are either obsolete or unintelligible to a child .</p>
   <p>But my chief literary sin — if sin it be — is twofold . In the first place I have departed wholly from the metrical arrangements of the originals — substituting therefore a variety of forms in line and stanza that more accord with the modern and American ear . In the second place I have had the hardihood — as in “ The Lion and The Gnat ” — to modify the elegance of the original with phrases more appropriate to our contemporary beasts . Animal talk , I feel sure , has lost something of its stateliness since the days when our French author overheard it . The Owl is no less pedantic perhaps , but the Lion certainly has declined in majesty — along with our human kings .</p>
   <p>For these offenses , La Fontaine — who forgave everyone — is bound to forgive me . The most good-humored Frenchmen , he could condone all faults but dullness . That offense against French fundamental principles invariably put him to sleep — whether the bore who button-holed him was a savant of the Sorbonne or just an ordinary ass .</p>
   <p>One thing more . This little collection from his 240 Fables is meant , first of all , for children . In assembling it no Fable was admitted that has not been approved by generations of the young and old . No apologue addressed to the mature intelligence alone , or framed to fit the society of his day , is here included .</p>
   <p>Many books which men have agreed to call classics are seldom taken down from the shelves . It is otherwise with La Fontaine . His Fables were eagerly read by the great men and women of his time , and are still read and enjoyed all the world over .</p>
   <p>The causes of this lasting popularity are not obscure . From the earliest period — whether in India , Greece , Arabia or Rome — the Fable has pleased and instructed mankind . It told important truths , easily perceived , in an entertaining way ; and often said more in a few words than could be said through any other kind of writing . Now , no one person is the author of the Fables we know so well . Aesop did not write the Fables bearing his name . There is even reason to believe that Aesop is himself a Fable . At any rate , the things ascribed to him are the work of many hands , and have undergone many changes . These old stories of animals began to be written so long ago , and the history of them is so vague and confusing , that only in recent years have scholars at last been able to trace them , and to fix their authorship .</p>
   <p>The significant thing to keep in mind is that , for twentieth century readers , the best Fables are not merely the best ones ever written , but the best ones re-written . In other words , the Fable was for centuries an old story in a rough state , and the writers who have made it most interesting are the writers who told it over again in a manner that makes it Art . A Greek named Babrius , of whom almost nothing is known , is remembered because he collected and versified some of the so-called Fables of Aesop . A Roman slave named Phaedrus also put these Fables into Latin verse ; and his work to-day is a text book in our colleges .</p>
   <p>Among modern writers , it was reserved for La Fontaine to take these ancient themes and make them his own — just as Moliere , “ taking his own wherever he found it , ” borrowed freely from the classics for his greatest plays ; just as Shakespeare re-formed forgotten tales with the glow and splendor of surpassing genius , so La Fontaine turned to India , Greece , Italy , and furnishing the old Fables and facetious tales , refreshed them with his originality . Some of them were his own inventions , but for the most part they were “ Aesop ” and Phaedrus , made over by poetic art and vivified with a wit and humor characteristically French .</p>
   <p>But if La Fontaine 's fame endures , it is not alone that he was the greatest lyric poet of a great literary period . Apart from the wit and fancy of his creations — apart from the philosophy , wisdom , and knowledge of human nature that so delighted Moliere , Boileau and Racine — his Fables disclose the goodness and simplicity of one who lived much with Nature , and cared nothing for the false splendors of the court . Living most of his life in the country , the woods , and streams and fields had been a constant source of inspiration . He saw animals through the eyes of a naturalist and poet ; and when he came to make them talk , the little fishes “ talked like little fishes — not like whales ” . With Shakespeare 's banished Frenchman in the Forest of Arden , he Finds tongues in trees , books in the running brooks , Sermons in stones , and good in everything .</p>
   <p>An anecdote often told of him aptly illustrates his habit of mind . He was late in coming to a fashionable dinner , and his excuse was this : “ I hope you will pardon me , ” he said . “ I was detained at the funeral of an ant , and I could not come until the ceremony was over . ”</p>
   <p>This was not a pleasantry , but the truth . He had been watching an ant-hill , and was so absorbed in observing a dead ant carried off by the living colonists for burial that he had forgotten his engagement .</p>
   <p>The first six volumes of the Fables — published in 1668 , when he was 47 , and in Paris — were an immediate and brilliant success , at a time when French genius was in full flower . But the literary men of that golden age got their pecuniary reward not from the public , but from patrons . Later in life , when La Fontaine at last was graciously recognized by the grand monarch , he appeared before the royal presence to receive his due . Even then , with his usual absentmindedness , he forgot to bring the book he was to present , and left behind him in the carriage the purse of gold the King bestowed upon him .</p>
   <p>However , the Fables brought him much in fame and friendship . Everybody loved La Fontaine . Favorite of great lords and ladies , the court of Louis XIV could not make him otherwise than natural . Poor and improvident , poverty had no pangs for him . No sorrow ever gave him a sleepless hour . To the last he lived up to his nickname — Bon-homme . And it is the gentle and good man who is always looking out at us at us from the fables he refashioned for all time .</p>

   <p>“ Dear me ! ” said the Miller , “ what am I to do ? Must I suit the whole world and the world 's father , too ? Yet it must end some time — so I 'll see the thing through . ”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Both Father and Son now decided to walk ,</l>
     <l n="2">While the Ass marched in front with a strut and a stalk ;</l>
     <l n="3">Yet the people who passed them continued to talk .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">Said one to another : “ Look there , if you please ,</l>
     <l n="5">How they wear out their shoes , while their Ass takes his ease .</l>
     <l n="6">Were there ever , d'ye think , three such asses as these ? ”</l>
     <l n="7">Said the Miller : “ You 're right . I 'm an Ass ! It is true .</l>
     <l n="8">Too long have I listened to people like you .</l>
     <l n="9">But now I am done with the whole kit and crew .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="10">“ Let them blame me or praise me , keep silent or yell ,</l>
     <l n="11">My goings and comings they cannot compel .</l>
     <l n="12">I will do as I please ! ” ... So he did — and did well .</l>
