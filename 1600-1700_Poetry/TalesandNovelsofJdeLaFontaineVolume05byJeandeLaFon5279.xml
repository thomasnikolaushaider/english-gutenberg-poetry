   <p>THE PRINCESS BETROTHED TO THE KING OF GARBA</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">WHAT various ways in which a thing is told</l>
     <l n="2">Some truth abuse , while others fiction hold ;</l>
     <l n="3">In stories we invention may admit ;</l>
     <l n="4">But diff'rent ‘ tis with what historick writ ;</l>
     <l n="5">Posterity demands that truth should then</l>
     <l n="6">Inspire relation , and direct the pen .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">ALACIEL 'S story 's of another kind ,</l>
     <l n="8">And I 've a little altered it , you 'll find ;</l>
     <l n="9">Faults some may see , and others disbelieve ;</l>
     <l n="10">‘ Tis all the same :— ‘ twill never make me grieve ;</l>
     <l n="11">Alaciel 's mem'ry , it is very clear ,</l>
     <l n="12">Can scarcely by it lose ; there 's naught to fear .</l>
     <l n="13">Two facts important I have kept in view ,</l>
     <l n="14">In which the author fully I pursue ;</l>
     <l n="15">The one — no less than eight the belle possessed ,</l>
     <l n="16">Before a husband 's sight her eyes had blessed ;</l>
     <l n="17">The other is , the prince she was to wed</l>
     <l n="18">Ne'er seemed to heed this trespass on his bed ,</l>
     <l n="19">But thought , perhaps , the beauty she had got</l>
     <l n="20">Would prove to any one a happy lot .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="21">HOWE'ER this fair , amid adventures dire ,</l>
     <l n="22">More sufferings shared than malice could desire ;</l>
     <l n="23">Though eight times , doubtless , she exchanged her knight</l>
     <l n="24">No proof , that she her spouse was led to slight ;</l>
     <l n="25">‘ Twas gratitude , compassion , or good will ;</l>
     <l n="26">The dread of worse ;— she 'd truly had her fill ;</l>
     <l n="27">Excuses just , to vindicate her fame ,</l>
     <l n="28">Who , spite of troubles , fanned the monarch 's flame :</l>
     <l n="29">Of eight the relict , still a maid received ;—</l>
     <l n="30">Apparently , the prince her pure believed ;</l>
     <l n="31">For , though at times we may be duped in this ,</l>
     <l n="32">Yet , after such a number — strange to miss !</l>
     <l n="33">And I submit to those who 've passed the scene ,</l>
     <l n="34">If they , to my opinion , do not lean .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="35">THE king of Alexandria , Zarus named ,</l>
     <l n="36">A daughter had , who all his fondness claimed ,</l>
     <l n="37">A star divine Alaciel shone around ,</l>
     <l n="38">The charms of beauty 's queen were in her found ;</l>
     <l n="39">With soul celestial , gracious , good , and kind ,</l>
     <l n="40">And all-accomplished , all-complying mind .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="41">THE , rumour of her worth spread far and wide ,</l>
     <l n="42">The king of Garba asked her for his bride ,</l>
     <l n="43">And Mamolin ( the sov'reign of the spot ,)</l>
     <l n="44">To other princes had a pref'rence got .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="45">THE fair , howe'er , already felt the smart</l>
     <l n="46">Of Cupid 's arrow , and had lost her heart ;</l>
     <l n="47">But ‘ twas not known : princesses love conceal ,</l>
     <l n="48">And scarcely dare its whispers fond reveal ;</l>
     <l n="49">Within their bosoms poignant pain remains ,</l>
     <l n="50">Though flesh and blood , like lasses of the plains .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="51">THE noble Hispal , one of zarus ’ court ,</l>
     <l n="52">A handsome youth , as histories report ,</l>
     <l n="53">Alaciel pleased ; a mutual flame arose ,</l>
     <l n="54">Though this they durst not venture to disclose</l>
     <l n="55">Or , if expressed , ‘ twas solely by the eyes :—</l>
     <l n="56">Soul-speaking language , nothing can disguise !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="57">AFFIANCED thus , the princess , with a sigh ,</l>
     <l n="58">Prepared to part , and fully to comply .</l>
     <l n="59">The father trusted her to Hispal 's care ,</l>
     <l n="60">Without the least suspicion of the snare ;</l>
     <l n="61">They soon embarked and ploughed the briny main ;</l>
     <l n="62">With anxious hopes in time the port to gain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="63">WHEN they , from Egypt 's coast had sailed a week ;</l>
     <l n="64">To gain the wind they saw a pirate seek ,</l>
     <l n="65">Which having done , he t'wards them bore in haste ,</l>
     <l n="66">To take the ship in which our fair was placed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="67">THE battle quickly raged ; alike they erred ;</l>
     <l n="68">The pirates slaughter loved , and blood preferred ,</l>
     <l n="69">And , long accustomed to the stormy tide ,</l>
     <l n="70">Were most expert , and on their skill relied .</l>
     <l n="71">In numbers , too , superior they were found ;</l>
     <l n="72">But Hisipal 's valour greatly shone around ,</l>
     <l n="73">And kept the combat undecided long ;</l>
     <l n="74">At length Grifonio , wond'rous large and strong ;</l>
     <l n="75">With twenty sturdy , pirates got on board ,</l>
     <l n="76">And many soon lay gasping by the sword .</l>
     <l n="77">Where'er he trod , grim death and horrour reigned ;</l>
     <l n="78">At length , the round the noble Hispal gained .</l>
     <l n="79">His nervous arm laid many wretches low</l>
     <l n="80">Rage marked his eyes , whene'er he dealt a blow :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="81">BUT , while the youth was thus engaged in fight ,</l>
     <l n="82">Grifonio ran to gain a sweeter sight ;</l>
     <l n="83">The princess was on board full well he knew ;</l>
     <l n="84">No time he lost , but to her chamber flew ;</l>
     <l n="85">And , since his pleasures seemed to be her doom ;</l>
     <l n="86">He bore her like a sparrow from the room :</l>
     <l n="87">But not content with such a charming fair ,</l>
     <l n="88">He took her diamonds , ornaments for hair ,</l>
     <l n="89">And those dear pledges ladies oft receive ,</l>
     <l n="90">When they a lover 's ardent flame believe .</l>
     <l n="91">Indeed , I 've heard it hinted as a truth ,</l>
     <l n="92">( And very probable for such a youth ,)</l>
     <l n="93">That Hispal , while on board , his flame revealed ;</l>
     <l n="94">And what chagrin she felt was then concealed ,</l>
     <l n="95">The passage thinking an improper time ,</l>
     <l n="96">To shew a marked displeasure at his crime .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="97">THE pirate-chief who carried off his prey ,</l>
     <l n="98">Had short-lived joy , for , wishing to convey</l>
     <l n="99">His charming captive from the ship with speed ;</l>
     <l n="100">One vessel chanced a little to recede ,</l>
     <l n="101">Although securely fastened by the crew ,</l>
     <l n="102">With grappling hooks , as usually they do ,</l>
     <l n="103">When quite intent to pass , young Hispal made</l>
     <l n="104">A blow , that dead at once the ruffian laid ;</l>
     <l n="105">His head and shoulders , severed from the trunk ;</l>
     <l n="106">Fell in the sea , and to the bottom sunk ,</l>
     <l n="107">Abjuring Mahomet , and all the tribe</l>
     <l n="108">Of idle prophets , Catholics proscribe ;</l>
     <l n="109">Erect the rest upon the legs remained ;</l>
     <l n="110">The very posture as before retained ;</l>
     <l n="111">This curious sight no doubt a laugh had raised ,—</l>
     <l n="112">But in the moment , she , so lately praised ,</l>
     <l n="113">With dread Grifonio , fell beyond their view ;</l>
     <l n="114">To save her , straight the gallant Hispal flew .</l>
     <l n="115">The ships , for want of pilots at the helm ,</l>
     <l n="116">At random drifted over Neptune 's realm .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="117">GRIM death the pirate forced to quit his slave ;</l>
     <l n="118">Buoyed up by clothes , she floated on the wave ,</l>
     <l n="119">‘ Till Hispal succour lent , who saw ‘ twas vain</l>
     <l n="120">To try with her the vessel to regain .</l>
     <l n="121">He could , with greater ease , the fair convey</l>
     <l n="122">To certain rocks , and thither bent his way ;</l>
     <l n="123">Those rocks to sailors oft destruction proved ,</l>
     <l n="124">But now the couple saved , who thither moved :</l>
     <l n="125">‘ Tis even said the jewels were not lost ,</l>
     <l n="126">But sweet Alaciel , howsoever tost ,</l>
     <l n="127">Preserved the caskets , which with strings were tied ;</l>
     <l n="128">And seizing these , the treasure drew aside .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="129">OUR swimmer on his back the princess bore ;</l>
     <l n="130">The rock attained ; but hardships were not o'er ;</l>
     <l n="131">Misfortunes dire the noble pair pursued</l>
     <l n="132">And famine , worst of ills , around was viewed .</l>
     <l n="133">No ship was near ; the light soon passed away ;</l>
     <l n="134">The night the same ; again appeared the day ;</l>
     <l n="135">No vessel hove in sight ; no food to eat ;</l>
     <l n="136">Our couple 's wretchedness seemed now complete ;</l>
     <l n="137">Hope left them both , and , mutual passion moved ,</l>
     <l n="138">Their situation more tormenting proved .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="139">LONG time in silence they each other eyed</l>
     <l n="140">At length , to speak the lovely charmer tried</l>
     <l n="141">Said she , ‘ tis useless , Hispal , to bewail :</l>
     <l n="142">Tears , with the cruel Parcae , naught avail ;</l>
     <l n="143">Each other to console be now our aim ;</l>
     <l n="144">Grim death his course will follow still the same .</l>
     <l n="145">To mitigate the smart let 's try anew ;</l>
     <l n="146">In such a place as this few joys accrue .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="147">CONSOLE each other , say you ? Hispal cried ;</l>
     <l n="148">What can console when forced one 's love to hide ?</l>
     <l n="149">Besides , fair princess , ev'ry way ‘ tis clear ,</l>
     <l n="150">Improper ‘ twere for you to love while here ;</l>
     <l n="151">I equally could death or famine brave ;</l>
     <l n="152">But you I tremble for , and wish to save .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="153">THESE words so pained the fair , that gushing tears</l>
     <l n="154">Bedewed Alaciel 's cheeks , her looks spoke fears ;</l>
     <l n="155">The ardent flame which she 'd so long concealed ;</l>
     <l n="156">Burst forth in sighs , and all its warmth revealed ;</l>
     <l n="157">While such emotion Hispal 's eyes expressed ,</l>
     <l n="158">That more than words his anxious wish confessed .</l>
     <l n="159">These tender scenes were followed by a kiss ,</l>
     <l n="160">The prelude sweet of soft enchanting bliss ;</l>
     <l n="161">But whether taken , or by choice bestowed ,</l>
     <l n="162">Alike ‘ twas clear , their heaving bosoms glowed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="163">THOSE vows now o'er , said Hispal with a sigh ,</l>
     <l n="164">In this adventure , if we 're doomed to die ,</l>
     <l n="165">Indiff'rent surely ‘ tis , the prey to be</l>
     <l n="166">Of birds of air , or fishes of the sea ;</l>
     <l n="167">My reason tells me ev'ry grave 's the same ,</l>
     <l n="168">Return we must , at last , from whence we came ,</l>
     <l n="169">Here ling'ring death alone we can expect ;</l>
     <l n="170">To brave the waves ‘ tis better to elect ;</l>
     <l n="171">I yet have strength , and ‘ tis not far to land ;</l>
     <l n="172">The wind sets fair : let 's try to gain the strand ;</l>
     <l n="173">From rock to rock we 'll go : I many view ,</l>
     <l n="174">Where I can rest ; to THIS we 'll bid adieu .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="175">TO move , Alaciel readily agreed ;</l>
     <l n="176">Again our couple ventured to proceed ;</l>
     <l n="177">The casket safe in tow ; the weather hot ;</l>
     <l n="178">From rock to rock with care our swimmer got ;</l>
     <l n="179">The princess , anxious on his back to keep :—</l>
     <l n="180">New mode of traversing the wat'ry deep .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="181">WITH Heav'n ' s assistance , and the rocks for rest ,</l>
     <l n="182">The youth , by hunger and fatigue oppressed ,</l>
     <l n="183">Uneasiness of mind , weighed down with care ,</l>
     <l n="184">Not for himself , but safety of the fair ,</l>
     <l n="185">A fast of two long tedious days now o'er ,</l>
     <l n="186">The casket and the belle he brought on shore :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="187">I THINK you cry — how wond'rously exact ,</l>
     <l n="188">To bring the casket into ev'ry act !</l>
     <l n="189">Is that a circumstance of weight I pray ?</l>
     <l n="190">It truly seems so , and without delay ,</l>
     <l n="191">You 'll see if I be wrong ; no airy flight ,</l>
     <l n="192">Or jeer , or raillery , have I in sight .</l>
     <l n="193">Had I embarked our couple in a ship</l>
     <l n="194">Without or cash or jewels for the trip ,</l>
     <l n="195">Distress had followed , you must be aware ;</l>
     <l n="196">‘ Tis past our pow'r to live on love or air ;</l>
     <l n="197">In vain AFFECTION ev'ry effort tries</l>
     <l n="198">Inexorable hunger ALL defies .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="199">THE casket , with the diamonds proved a source ,</l>
     <l n="200">To which ‘ twas requisite to have recourse ;</l>
     <l n="201">Some Hispal sold , and others put in pawn ,</l>
     <l n="202">And purchased , near the coast , a house and lawn ;</l>
     <l n="203">With woods , extensive park , and pleasure ground ;</l>
     <l n="204">And many bow'rs and shady walks around ,</l>
     <l n="205">Where charming hours they passed , and this ‘ twas plain ,</l>
     <l n="206">Without the casket they could n'er obtain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="207">BENEATH the wood there was a secret grot ,</l>
     <l n="208">Where lovers , when they pleased , concealment got ,</l>
     <l n="209">A quiet , gloomy , solitary place ,</l>
     <l n="210">Designed by nature for the billing race .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="211">ONE day , as through the grove a walk they sought ,</l>
     <l n="212">The god of love our couple thither brought ;</l>
     <l n="213">His wishes , Hispal , as they went along ,</l>
     <l n="214">Explained im part by words direct and strong ;</l>
     <l n="215">The rest his sighs expressed , ( they spoke the soul ;) —</l>
     <l n="216">The princess , trembling , listened to the whole .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="217">SAID he , we now are in a place retired ,</l>
     <l n="218">Unknown to man , ( such spots how oft desired ! )</l>
     <l n="219">Let 's take advantage of the present hour :</l>
     <l n="220">No joys , but those of LOVE , are in our pow'r ;</l>
     <l n="221">All others see withdrawn ! and no one knows</l>
     <l n="222">We even live ; perhaps both friends and foes</l>
     <l n="223">Believe us in the belly of a whale ;</l>
     <l n="224">Allow me , lovely princess , to prevail ;</l>
     <l n="225">Bestow your kindness , or , without delay ,</l>
     <l n="226">Those charms to Mamolin let me convey .</l>
     <l n="227">Yet , why go thither ?— happy you could make</l>
     <l n="228">The man , whose constancy no perils shake ,</l>
     <l n="229">What would you more ?— his passion 's ardent grown ;</l>
     <l n="230">And surely you 've enough resistance shown .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="231">SUCH tender elocution Hispal used ,</l>
     <l n="232">That e'en to marble , ‘ Twould have warmth infused ;</l>
     <l n="233">While fair Alaciel , on the bark of trees ,</l>
     <l n="234">With bodkin wrote , apparently at ease .</l>
     <l n="235">But Cupid drew her thoughts to higher things ,</l>
     <l n="236">Than merely graving what from fancy springs .</l>
     <l n="237">Her lover and the place , at once assured ,</l>
     <l n="238">That such a secret would be well secured ;</l>
     <l n="239">A tempting bait , which made her , with regret ,</l>
