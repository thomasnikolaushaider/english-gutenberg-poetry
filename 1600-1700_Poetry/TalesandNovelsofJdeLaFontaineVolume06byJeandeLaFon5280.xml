    <head>THE MAGICK CUP</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">THE worst of ills , with jealousy compared ,</l>
     <l n="2">Are trifling torments ev'ry where declared .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">IMAGINE , to yourself a silly fool ,</l>
     <l n="4">To dark suspicion grown an easy tool ;</l>
     <l n="5">No soft repose he finds , by night or day ;</l>
     <l n="6">But rings his ear , he 's wretched ev'ry way !</l>
     <l n="7">Continually he dreams his forehead sprouts ;</l>
     <l n="8">The truth of reveries he never doubts .</l>
     <l n="9">But this I would not fully guaranty ,</l>
     <l n="10">For he who dreams , ‘ tis said , asleep should be ;</l>
     <l n="11">And those who 've caught , from time to time , a peep ,</l>
     <l n="12">Pretend to say — the jealous never sleep .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">A MAN who has suspicions soon will rouse ;</l>
     <l n="14">But buz a fly around his precious spouse ,</l>
     <l n="15">At once he fancies cuckoldom is brought ,</l>
     <l n="16">And nothing can eradicate the thought ;</l>
     <l n="17">In spite of reason he must have a place ,</l>
     <l n="18">And numbered be , among the horned race ;</l>
     <l n="19">A cuckold to himself he freely owns ,</l>
     <l n="20">Though otherwise perhaps in flesh and bones .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="21">GOOD folks , of cuckoldom , pray what 's the harm ,</l>
     <l n="22">To give , from time to time , such dire alarm ?</l>
     <l n="23">What injury ‘ s received , and what ‘ s the wrong ,</l>
     <l n="24">At which so many sneer and loll their tongue ?</l>
     <l n="25">While unacquainted with the fact , ‘ tis naught ;</l>
     <l n="26">If known :— e'en then ‘ tis scarcely worth a thought .</l>
     <l n="27">You think , however , ‘ tis a serious grief ;</l>
     <l n="28">Then try to doubt it , which may bring relief ,</l>
     <l n="29">And do n't resemble him who took a sup ,</l>
     <l n="30">From out the celebrated magick cup .</l>
     <l n="31">Be warned by others ’ ills ; the tale I 'll tell ;</l>
     <l n="32">Perhaps your irksomeness it may dispel .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">BUT first , by reason let me prove , I pray ,</l>
     <l n="34">That evil such as this , and which you say ,</l>
     <l n="35">Oft weighs you down with soul-corroding care ;</l>
     <l n="36">Is only in the mind :— mere spright of air :</l>
     <l n="37">Your hat upon your head for instance place ,</l>
     <l n="38">Less gently rather than 's your usual case ;</l>
     <l n="39">Pray , do n't it presently at ease remain ?</l>
     <l n="40">And from it do you aught amiss retain ?</l>
     <l n="41">Not e'en a spot ; there 's nothing half so clear ;</l>
     <l n="42">The features , too , they as before appear ?</l>
     <l n="43">No difference assuredly you see ?</l>
     <l n="44">Then how can cuckoldom an evil be ?</l>
     <l n="45">Such my conclusion , spite of fools or brutes ,</l>
     <l n="46">With whose ideas reason never suits .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="47">YES , yes , but honour has , you know , a claim :</l>
     <l n="48">Who e'er denied it ?— never ‘ twas my aim .</l>
     <l n="49">But what of honour ?— nothing else is heard ;</l>
     <l n="50">At Rome a different conduct is preferred ;</l>
     <l n="51">The cuckold there , who takes the thing to heart ,</l>
     <l n="52">Is thought a fool , and acts a blockhead 's part ;</l>
     <l n="53">While he , who laughs , is always well received</l>
     <l n="54">And honest fellow through the town believed .</l>
     <l n="55">Were this misfortune viewed with proper eyes ,</l>
     <l n="56">Such ills from cuckoldom would ne'er arise .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="57">THAT advantageous ‘ tis , we now will prove :</l>
     <l n="58">Folks laugh ; your wife a pliant glove shall move ;</l>
     <l n="59">But , if you 've twenty favourites around ,</l>
     <l n="60">A single syllable will ne'er resound .</l>
     <l n="61">Whene'er you speak , each word has double force ;</l>
     <l n="62">At table , you 've precedency of course ,</l>
     <l n="63">And oft will get the very nicest parts ;</l>
     <l n="64">Well pleased who serves you !— all the household smarts</l>
     <l n="65">No means neglect your favour to obtain ;</l>
     <l n="66">You 've full command ; resistance would be vain .</l>
     <l n="67">Whence this conclusion must directly spring :</l>
     <l n="68">To be a cuckold is a useful thing .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="69">AT cards , should adverse fortune you pursue ;</l>
     <l n="70">To take revenge is ever thought your due ;</l>
     <l n="71">And your opponent often will revoke ,</l>
     <l n="72">That you for better luck may have a cloak :</l>
     <l n="73">If you 've a friend o'er head and ears in debt :</l>
     <l n="74">At once , to help him numbers you can get .</l>
     <l n="75">You fancy these your rind regales and cheers</l>
     <l n="76">She 's better for it ; more beautiful appears ;</l>
     <l n="77">The Spartan king , in Helen found new charms ,</l>
     <l n="78">When he 'd recovered her from Paris ’ arms .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="79">YOUR wife the same ; to make her , in your eye ,</l>
     <l n="80">More beautiful ‘ s the aim you may rely ;</l>
     <l n="81">For , if unkind , she would a hag be thought ,</l>
     <l n="82">Incapable soft love scenes to be taught .</l>
     <l n="83">These reasons make me to my thesis cling ,—</l>
     <l n="84">To be a cuckold is a useful thing .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="85">IF much too long this introduction seem ,</l>
     <l n="86">The obvious cause is clearly in the theme ,</l>
     <l n="87">And should not certainly be hurried o'er ,</l>
     <l n="88">But now for something from th ’ historick store .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="89">A CERTAIN man , no matter for his name ,</l>
     <l n="90">His country , rank , nor residence nor fame ,</l>
     <l n="91">Through fear of accidents had firmly sworn ,</l>
     <l n="92">The marriage chain should ne'er by him be worn ;</l>
     <l n="93">No tie but friendship , from the sex he 'd crave :</l>
     <l n="94">If wrong or right , the question we will wave .</l>
     <l n="95">Be this as ‘ t will , since Hymen could not find</l>
     <l n="96">Our wight to bear the wedded knot inclined ,</l>
     <l n="97">The god of love , to manage for him tried ,</l>
     <l n="98">And what he wished , from time to time supplied ;</l>
     <l n="99">A lively fair he got , who charms displayed ,</l>
     <l n="100">And made him father to a little maid ;</l>
     <l n="101">Then died , and left the spark dissolved in tears :</l>
     <l n="102">Not such as flow for wives , ( as oft appears )</l>
     <l n="103">When mourning ‘ s nothing more than change of dress :</l>
     <l n="104">His anguish spoke the soul in great distress .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="105">THE daughter grew in years , improved in mien ,</l>
     <l n="106">And soon the woman in her air was seen ;</l>
     <l n="107">Time rolls apace , and once she 's ridded of her bib ,</l>
     <l n="108">Then alters daily , and her tongue gets glib ,</l>
     <l n="109">Each year still taller , till she 's found at length ;</l>
     <l n="110">A perfect belle in look , in age , in strength .</l>
     <l n="111">His forward child , the father justly feared ,</l>
     <l n="112">Would cheat the priest of fees so much revered ;</l>
     <l n="113">The lawyer too , and god of marriage-joys ;</l>
     <l n="114">Sad fault , that future prospects oft destroys :</l>
     <l n="115">To trust her virtue was not quite so sure ;</l>
     <l n="116">He chose a convent , to be more secure ,</l>
     <l n="117">Where this young charmer learned to pray and sew ;</l>
     <l n="118">No wicked books , unfit for girls to know ,</l>
     <l n="119">Corruption 's page the senses to beguile</l>
     <l n="120">Dan Cupid never writes in convent style :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="121">OF nothing would she talk but holy-writ ;</l>
     <l n="122">On which she could herself so well acquit ,</l>
     <l n="123">That oft the gravest teachers were confused ;</l>
     <l n="124">To praise her beauty , scarcely was excused ;</l>
     <l n="125">No flatt'ry pleasure gave , and she 'd reply :</l>
     <l n="126">Good sister stay !— consider , we must die ;</l>
     <l n="127">Each feature perishes :— ‘ tis naught but clay ;</l>
     <l n="128">And soon will worms upon our bodies prey :</l>
     <l n="129">Superior needle-work our fair could do ;</l>
     <l n="130">The spindle turn at ease :— embroider too ;</l>
     <l n="131">Minerva 's skill , or Clotho 's , could impart ;</l>
     <l n="132">In tapestry she 'd gained Arachne 's art ;</l>
     <l n="133">And other talents , too , the daughter showed ;</l>
     <l n="134">Her sense , wealth , beauty , soon were spread abroad :</l>
     <l n="135">But most her wealth a marked attention drew ;</l>
     <l n="136">The belle had been immured with prudent view ,</l>
     <l n="137">To keep her safely till a spouse was found ,</l>
     <l n="138">Who with sufficient riches should abound .</l>
     <l n="139">From convents , heiresses are often led</l>
     <l n="140">Directly to the altar to be wed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="141">SOME time the father had the girl declared</l>
     <l n="142">His lawful child , who all his fondness shared .</l>
     <l n="143">As soon as she was free from convent walls ,</l>
     <l n="144">Her taste at once was changed from books to balls ;</l>
     <l n="145">Around Calista ( such was named our fair )</l>
     <l n="146">A host of lovers showed attentive care ;</l>
     <l n="147">Cits , courtiers , officers , the beau , the sage ,</l>
     <l n="148">Adventurers of ev'ry rank and age .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="149">FROM these Calista presently made choice ,</l>
     <l n="150">Of one for whom her father gave his voice ;</l>
     <l n="151">A handsome lad , and thought good humoured too</l>
     <l n="152">Few otherwise appear when first they woo .</l>
     <l n="153">Her fortune ample was ; the dow'r the same ;</l>
     <l n="154">The belle an only child ; the like her flame .</l>
     <l n="155">But better still , our couple 's chief delight ,</l>
     <l n="156">Was mutual love and pleasure to excite .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="157">TWO years in paradise thus passed the pair ,</l>
     <l n="158">When bliss was changed to Hell 's worst cank'ring care ;</l>
     <l n="159">A fit of jealousy the husband grieved ,</l>
     <l n="160">And , strange to tell , he all at once believed ,</l>
     <l n="161">A lover with success his wife addressed ,</l>
     <l n="162">When , but for him , the suit had ne'er been pressed ;</l>
     <l n="163">For though the spark , the charming fair to gain ,</l>
     <l n="164">Would ev'ry wily method try , ‘ twas plain ,</l>
     <l n="165">Yet had the husband never terrors shown ,</l>
     <l n="166">The lover , in despair , had quickly flown .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="167">WHAT should a husband do whose wife is sought ,</l>
     <l n="168">With anxious fondness by another ? Naught .</l>
     <l n="169">‘ Tis this that leads me ever to advise ,</l>
     <l n="170">To sleep at ease whichever side he lies .</l>
     <l n="171">In case she lends the spark a willing ear ,</l>
     <l n="172">‘ Twill not be better if you interfere :</l>
     <l n="173">She 'll seek more opportunities you 'll find ;</l>
     <l n="174">But if to pay attention she 's inclined ,</l>
     <l n="175">You 'll raise the inclination in her brain ,</l>
     <l n="176">And then the danger will begin again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="177">WHERE'ER suspicion dwells you may be sure ,</l>
     <l n="178">To cuckoldom ‘ twill prove a place secure .</l>
     <l n="179">But Damon ( such the husband 's name ) , ‘ tis clear ,</l>
     <l n="180">Thought otherwise , as we shall make appear .</l>
     <l n="181">He merits pity , and should be excused ,</l>
     <l n="182">Since he , by bad advice , was much abused ;</l>
     <l n="183">When had he trusted to himself to guide ,</l>
     <l n="184">He 'd acted wisely , ’ — hear and you 'll decide .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="185">THE Enchantress Neria flourished in those days ;</l>
     <l n="186">E'en Circe , she excelled in Satan 's ways ;</l>
     <l n="187">The storms she made obedient to her will ,</l>
     <l n="188">And regulated with superior skill ;</l>
     <l n="189">In chains the destinies she kept around ;</l>
     <l n="190">The gentle zephyrs were her sages found ;</l>
     <l n="191">The winds , her lacqueys , flew with rapid course ;</l>
     <l n="192">Alert , but obstinate , with pow'rful force .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="193">WITH all her art th ’ enchantress could not find ,</l>
     <l n="194">A charm to guard her ‘ gainst the urchin blind ;</l>
     <l n="195">Though she 'd the pow'r to stop the star of day ,</l>
     <l n="196">She burned to gain a being formed of clay .</l>
     <l n="197">If merely a salute her wish had been ,</l>
     <l n="198">She might have had it , easily was seen ;</l>
     <l n="199">But bliss unbounded clearly was her view ,</l>
     <l n="200">And this with anxious ardour she 'd pursue .</l>
     <l n="201">Though charms she had , still Damon would remain ,</l>
     <l n="202">To her who had his heart a faithful swain :</l>
     <l n="203">In vain she sought the genial soft caress :</l>
     <l n="204">To Neria naught but friendship he 'd express .</l>
     <l n="205">Like Damon , husbands nowhere now are found ,</l>
     <l n="206">And I 'm not certain , such were e'er on ground .</l>
     <l n="207">I rather fancy , hist'ry is not here ,</l>
     <l n="208">What we would wish , since truth it do n't revere ,</l>
     <l n="209">I nothing in the hippogriff perceive ,</l>
     <l n="210">Or lance enchanted , but we may believe ;</l>
     <l n="211">Yet this I must confess has raised surprise ,</l>
     <l n="212">Howe'er , to pass it will perhaps suffice ;</l>
     <l n="213">I 've many passed the same ,— in ancient days ;</l>
     <l n="214">Men different were from us : had other ways ;</l>
     <l n="215">Unlike the present manners , we 'll suppose ;</l>
     <l n="216">Or history would other facts disclose .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="217">THE am'rous Neria to obtain her end ,</l>
     <l n="218">Made use of philters , and would e'en descend ;</l>
     <l n="219">To ev'ry wily look and secret art ,</l>
     <l n="220">That could to him she loved her flame impart .</l>
     <l n="221">Our swain his marriage vow to this opposed ;</l>
     <l n="222">At which th ’ enchantress much surprise disclosed .</l>
     <l n="223">You doubtless fancy , she exclaimed one day ,</l>
     <l n="224">That your fidelity must worth display ;</l>
     <l n="225">But I should like to know if equal care ,</l>
     <l n="226">Calista takes to act upon the square .</l>
     <l n="227">Suppose your wife had got a smart gallant ,</l>
     <l n="228">Would you refuse as much a fair to grant ?</l>
     <l n="229">And if Calista , careless of your fame ,</l>
     <l n="230">Should carry to extremes a guilty flame ,</l>
     <l n="231">Would you but half way go ? I truly thought ,</l>
     <l n="232">By sturdy hymen thus you 'd not be caught .</l>
     <l n="233">Domestick joys should be to cits confined ;</l>
     <l n="234">For none but such were scenes like those designed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="235">BUT as to you :— decline Love 's choice pursuit !</l>
     <l n="236">No anxious wish to taste forbidden fruit ?</l>
     <l n="237">Though such you banish from your thoughts I see ,</l>
     <l n="238">A friend thereto I fain would have you be .</l>
     <l n="239">Come make the trial : you 'll Calista find ,</l>
     <l n="240">Quite new again when to her arms resigned .</l>
     <l n="241">But let me tell you , though your wife be chaste ,</l>
     <l n="242">Erastus to your mansion oft is traced .</l>
    </lg>
