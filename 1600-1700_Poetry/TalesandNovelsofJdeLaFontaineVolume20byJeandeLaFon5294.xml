    <head>THE DEVIL IN HELL</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">HE surely must be wrong who loving fears ;</l>
     <l n="2">And does not flee when beauty first appears .</l>
     <l n="3">Ye FAIR , with charms divine , I know your fame ;</l>
     <l n="4">No more I 'll burn my fingers in the flame .</l>
     <l n="5">From you a soft sensation seems to rise ,</l>
     <l n="6">And , to the heart , advances through the eyes ;</l>
     <l n="7">What there it causes I 've no need to tell :</l>
     <l n="8">Some die of love , or languish in the spell .</l>
     <l n="9">Far better surely mortals here might do ;</l>
     <l n="10">There 's no occasion dangers to pursue .</l>
     <l n="11">By way of proof a charmer I will bring ,</l>
     <l n="12">Whose beauty to a hermit gave the sting :</l>
     <l n="13">Thence , save the sin , which fully I except ;</l>
     <l n="14">A very pleasant intercourse was kept ;</l>
     <l n="15">Except the sin , again I must repeat ,</l>
     <l n="16">My sentiments on this will never meet</l>
     <l n="17">The taste of him at Rome , who wine had swilled ,</l>
     <l n="18">Till , to the throat , he thoroughly was filled ,</l>
     <l n="19">And then exclaimed , is't not a sin to drink ?</l>
     <l n="20">Such conduct horrid ever I shall think ;</l>
     <l n="21">I wish to prove , e'en saints in fear should live ;</l>
     <l n="22">The truth is clear :— our faults may Heav'n forgive ;</l>
     <l n="23">If dread of punishment , from pow'rs divine ,</l>
     <l n="24">Had led this friar in the proper line ,</l>
     <l n="25">He never had the charming girl retained ,</l>
     <l n="26">Who , young and artless , would your heart have gained .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="27">HER name was Alibech , if I recollect ;</l>
     <l n="28">Too innocent , deceptions to detect .</l>
     <l n="29">One day this lovely maiden having read ,</l>
     <l n="30">How certain pious , holy saints were led ,</l>
     <l n="31">The better to observe religious care ,</l>
     <l n="32">To seek retirement in some lorn repair ,</l>
     <l n="33">Where they , like Heav'nly Angels , moved around ,</l>
     <l n="34">Some here , some there , were in concealment found ,</l>
     <l n="35">Was quite delighted , strange as it may seem ,</l>
     <l n="36">And presently she formed the frantick scheme ,</l>
     <l n="37">Of imitating those her mind revered ,</l>
     <l n="38">And to her plan most rigidly adhered .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="39">WITH silent steps the innocent withdrew ;</l>
     <l n="40">To mothers , sisters ,— none she bade adieu .</l>
     <l n="41">Long time she walked through fields , and plain , and dale ;</l>
     <l n="42">At length she gained a wood within a vale ;</l>
     <l n="43">There met an aged man , who once might be ,</l>
     <l n="44">Gay , airy , pleasing , blithe , gallant , and free ,</l>
     <l n="45">But now a meagre skeleton was seen</l>
     <l n="46">The shadow only of what late he 'd been :</l>
     <l n="47">Said she , good father , I have much desire</l>
     <l n="48">To be a saint : thither my hopes aspire ;</l>
     <l n="49">I fain would merit reverence and prayer ,</l>
     <l n="50">A festival have kept with anxious care ;</l>
     <l n="51">What pleasure , ev'ry year , the palm in hand ,</l>
     <l n="52">And , beaming round the head , a holy band ,</l>
     <l n="53">Nice presents , flow'rs , and off'rings to receive</l>
     <l n="54">Your practice difficult must I believe ?</l>
     <l n="55">Already I can fast for many days ,</l>
     <l n="56">And soon should learn to follow all your ways .</l>
     <l n="57">Go , said the aged man , your plan resign ;</l>
     <l n="58">I 'd have you , as a friend , the state decline ;</l>
     <l n="59">‘ Tis not so easy sanctity to meet ,</l>
     <l n="60">That fasting should suffice the boon to greet .</l>
     <l n="61">Heav'n guards from ill the maids and wives who fast ,</l>
     <l n="62">Or holiness would very seldom last .</l>
     <l n="63">‘ Tis requisite to practise other things ;</l>
     <l n="64">These secrets are , which move by hidden springs ;</l>
     <l n="65">A hermit , whom you 'll find beneath yon ’ beech ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="66">Can , better far than I , their virtues teach ;</l>
     <l n="67">Go , seek him , pray , make haste if you are sage ;</l>
     <l n="68">I ne'er retain such birds within my cage .</l>
     <l n="69">This having said , at once he left the belle ,</l>
     <l n="70">And wisely shut the door , and barred his cell :</l>
     <l n="71">Not trusting hair-cloth , fasting , age , nor gout ;</l>
     <l n="72">With beauty , anchorites themselves should doubt .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="73">OUR pensive fair soon found the person meant ,</l>
     <l n="74">A man whose soul was on religion bent ;</l>
     <l n="75">His name was Rustick , young and warm in prayer ;</l>
     <l n="76">Such youthful hermits of deception share .</l>
     <l n="77">Her holy wish , the girl to him expressed ,</l>
     <l n="78">A wish most fervent doubtless to be blessed ,</l>
     <l n="79">And felt so strongly , Alibech had fear ,</l>
     <l n="80">Some day the mark might on her fruit appear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="81">A SMILE her innocence from Rustick drew ;</l>
     <l n="82">Said he , in me you little learning view ;</l>
     <l n="83">But what I 've got , I 'll readily divide ,</l>
     <l n="84">And nothing from your senses try to hide .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="85">THE hermit surely would have acted right ;</l>
     <l n="86">Such pupil to have sent away at sight .</l>
     <l n="87">He managed otherwise , as we shall state ;</l>
     <l n="88">The consequences , let us now relate .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="89">SINCE much he wished perfection to pursue ;</l>
     <l n="90">He , to himself , exclaimed : what can'st thou do ?</l>
     <l n="91">Watch , fast , and pray ; wear hair-cloth too ; but this</l>
     <l n="92">Is surely little that will lead to bliss ;</l>
     <l n="93">All do as much , but with a FAIR to dwell ,</l>
     <l n="94">And , never touch her , would be to excel ;</l>
     <l n="95">‘ Twere triumph ‘ mong the Heav'nly Angels thought ;</l>
     <l n="96">Let 's merit it , and keep what here is brought ;</l>
     <l n="97">If I resist a thing so sweet and kind ,</l>
     <l n="98">I gain the end that pow'rs divine designed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="99">HE with him let the charming belle remain ;</l>
     <l n="100">And confident he could at will abstain ,</l>
     <l n="101">Both Satan and the flesh at once defied :</l>
     <l n="102">Two foes on mischief ready to decide .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="103">BEHOLD our saints together in a hut ;</l>
     <l n="104">Young Rustick , where a corner seemed to jut ;</l>
     <l n="105">A bed of rushes for the novice placed ,</l>
     <l n="106">Since sleeping on the floor had her debased ,</l>
     <l n="107">Who , yet unused to hardships , much must feel :</l>
     <l n="108">‘ Twas best that these should on her senses steal .</l>
     <l n="109">A little fruit , and bread not over fine ,</l>
     <l n="110">She had for supper :— water too for wine .</l>
     <l n="111">The hermit fasted ; but the lady fed ,</l>
     <l n="112">And ate with appetite her fruit and bread .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="113">APART their place of rest , the maiden slept ,</l>
     <l n="114">But something quite awake the other kept :</l>
     <l n="115">The Devil could by no means quiet rest ,</l>
     <l n="116">Till he should get admitted as a guest .</l>
     <l n="117">He was received within the humble cell ;</l>
     <l n="118">The friar 's thoughts were on his smiling belle ,</l>
     <l n="119">Her simple manners , fascinating grace ,</l>
     <l n="120">Complexion , age ; each feature he would trace ;</l>
     <l n="121">The heaving bosom , and the beauteous charms ;</l>
     <l n="122">That made him wish to clasp her in his arms .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="123">BY passion moved , he bade at once adieu ,</l>
     <l n="124">To hair-cloth , discipline , and fasting too ;</l>
     <l n="125">Cried he , my saints are these ; to them I 'll pray ;</l>
     <l n="126">From Alibech no longer he would stay ,</l>
     <l n="127">But to her flew , and roused the girl from sleep :</l>
     <l n="128">Said he , so soon you should not silence keep ,</l>
     <l n="129">It is not right :— there 's something to be done ,</l>
     <l n="130">Ere we suspend the converse we 've begun :</l>
     <l n="131">‘ Tis proper that , to please the pow'rs divine ;</l>
     <l n="132">We Satan instantly in Hell confine ;</l>
     <l n="133">He was created for no other end ;</l>
     <l n="134">To block him up let 's ev'ry effort lend .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="135">IMMEDIATELY within the bed he slid ,</l>
     <l n="136">When , scarcely knowing what young Rustick did ;</l>
     <l n="137">And , unaccustomed to the mystick scene ,</l>
     <l n="138">She knew not what the anchorite could mean ,</l>
     <l n="139">Nor this nor that but , partly by consent ,</l>
     <l n="140">And partly force , yet wishing to prevent ,</l>
     <l n="141">Though not presuming to resist his sway</l>
     <l n="142">To him ‘ mid pain and pleasure , she gave way ,</l>
     <l n="143">Believing ev'ry thing was most exact ,</l>
     <l n="144">And , what the saint performed , a gracious act ,</l>
     <l n="145">By thus the Devil shutting up in Hell ,</l>
     <l n="146">Where he was destined with his imps to dwell .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="147">HENCEFORTH ‘ twas requisite , if saint she 'd be ;</l>
     <l n="148">From martyrdom she must not think to flee ,</l>
     <l n="149">For friar Rustick little sought to please :</l>
     <l n="150">The lesson was not given quite at ease ,</l>
     <l n="151">Which made the girl ( not much improved in wit )</l>
     <l n="152">Exclaim , this Devil mischief will commit ;</l>
     <l n="153">‘ Tis very plain , though strange it may appear</l>
     <l n="154">To hurt his prison e'en he 'll persevere ;</l>
     <l n="155">The injury now you clearly may perceive ;</l>
     <l n="156">But , for the evil done , I shall not grieve :</l>
     <l n="157">Yet richly he deserves to be again</l>
     <l n="158">Shut up effectually in his domain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="159">IT shall be so , the anchorite replied ;</l>
     <l n="160">Once more the mystick art was fully tried ;</l>
     <l n="161">Such care he took , such charity was shown ,</l>
     <l n="162">That Hell , by use , free with the Devil grown ,</l>
     <l n="163">His presence pleasant always would have found ;</l>
     <l n="164">Could Rustick equally have kept his ground .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="165">CRIED Alibech , ‘ tis very truly said ,</l>
     <l n="166">No prison has so nice and soft a bed ,</l>
     <l n="167">But presently the host will weary grow ;</l>
     <l n="168">And here our pair soon discord seemed to show :</l>
     <l n="169">Hell , for the prisoner , in vain inquired ;</l>
     <l n="170">Deaf was the fiend , and quietly retired ;</l>
     <l n="171">Repeated calls of course must irksome prove :</l>
     <l n="172">The fair grew weary , when he would not move ;</l>
     <l n="173">Her strong desire to be a saint declined ;</l>
     <l n="174">And Rustick to get rid of her designed ;</l>
     <l n="175">In this with him the belle agreed so well ,</l>
     <l n="176">That secretly she left the hermit 's cell ,</l>
     <l n="177">And home returned in haste the shortest way ;</l>
     <l n="178">But what the fair could to her parents say ,</l>
     <l n="179">Is what I fain would know , though truly yet ;</l>
     <l n="180">The full particulars I ne'er could get .</l>
     <l n="181">‘ Tis probable she made them understand ,</l>
     <l n="182">Her heart was prompted by divine command ;</l>
     <l n="183">To try to be a saint ; that they believed ,</l>
     <l n="184">Or seemingly for truth the tale received .</l>
     <l n="185">Perhaps the parents were not quite exact ,</l>
     <l n="186">In narrowly examining the fact ;</l>
     <l n="187">Though some suspicions doubtless might arise</l>
     <l n="188">About her Hell , they could not well disguise ;</l>
     <l n="189">But ‘ tis so formed that little can be seen ,</l>
     <l n="190">And many jailors in it duped have been .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="191">FOR Alibech great feasting was prepared ,</l>
     <l n="192">When , through simplicity , the girl declared ,</l>
     <l n="193">To those around , without the least restraint ,</l>
     <l n="194">How she had acted to be made a saint .</l>
     <l n="195">You 'd surely no occasion , they replied ,</l>
     <l n="196">To go so far instruction to provide ,</l>
     <l n="197">When at your house you might have had , with ease ,</l>
     <l n="198">Like secret lectures , just as you should please .</l>
     <l n="199">Said one , my brother could the thing have done ;</l>
     <l n="200">Another cried ,— my cousin would have run</l>
     <l n="201">To do the same ; or Neherbal , who 's near ,</l>
     <l n="202">No novice in the business would appear ;</l>
     <l n="203">He seeks your hand , which you 'll be wise to take</l>
     <l n="204">Before he learns — what might a diff'rence make .</l>
     <l n="205">She took the hint , and he the fair received ;</l>
     <l n="206">A handsome fortune many fears relieved ;</l>
     <l n="207">This joined to num'rous charms that had the belle ;</l>
     <l n="208">He fancied pure a most suspicious Hell ,</l>
     <l n="209">And freely used the blessings Hymen sends ;</l>
     <l n="210">May Heav'n like joys bestow on all our friends !</l>

    <head>NEIGHBOUR PETER 'S MARE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A CERTAIN pious rector ( John his name ) ,</l>
     <l n="2">But little preached , except when vintage came ;</l>
     <l n="3">And then no preparation he required</l>
     <l n="4">On this he triumphed and was much admired .</l>
     <l n="5">Another point he handled very well ,</l>
     <l n="6">Though oft'ner he 'd thereon have liked to dwell ,</l>
     <l n="7">And this the children of the present day ,</l>
     <l n="8">So fully know , there 's naught for me to say :</l>
     <l n="9">John to the senses things so clearly brought ,</l>
     <l n="10">That much by wives and husbands he was sought ,</l>
     <l n="11">Who held his knowledge of superior price ,</l>
     <l n="12">And paid attention to his sage advice .</l>
     <l n="13">Around , whatever conscience he might find ,</l>
     <l n="14">To soft delights and easy ways inclined ,</l>
     <l n="15">In person he would rigidly attend ,</l>
     <l n="16">And seek to act the confessor and friend ;</l>
     <l n="17">Not e'en his curate would he trust with these ;</l>
     <l n="18">But zealously he tried to give them ease ,</l>
     <l n="19">And ev'ry where would due attention show ,</l>
     <l n="20">Observing that divines should always know</l>
     <l n="21">Their flocks most thoroughly and visit round ;</l>
     <l n="22">To give instruction and the truth expound .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="23">AMONG the folks , to whom he visits paid ,</l>
     <l n="24">Was neighbour Peter , one who used the spade ;</l>
     <l n="25">A villager that God , in lieu of lands ,</l>
     <l n="26">Had furnished only with a pair of hands ,</l>
     <l n="27">To dig and delve , and by the mattock gain</l>
     <l n="28">Enough his wife and children to maintain .</l>
     <l n="29">Still youthful charms you in his spouse might trace ;</l>
     <l n="30">The weather injured solely had her face ,</l>
     <l n="31">But not the features which were perfect yet :</l>
     <l n="32">Some wish perhaps more blooming belles to get ;</l>
     <l n="33">The rustick truly me would ne'er have pleased ;</l>
     <l n="34">But such are oft by country parsons seized ,</l>
     <l n="35">Who low amours and dishes coarse admire ,</l>
     <l n="36">That palates more refined would not desire .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="37">THE pastor John would often on her leer ,</l>
     <l n="38">just as a cur , when store of bones are near ,</l>

     <l n="42">Now prick his ears ; then fear he can n't prevail ,</l>
     <l n="43">The eyes still fixed upon the bite in sight ,</l>
     <l n="44">Which twenty times to these affords delight ,</l>

     <l n="119">THE husband promised he would hold his tongue ;</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="127">WHEN Magdalene was to the linen come ,</l>
     <l n="128">Some marks of shame around her senses swum ;</l>
     <l n="129">A wife to live and die was her desire ,</l>
     <l n="130">Much rather than be seen in Eve 's attire ;</l>
     <l n="131">She vowed that , spite of what the priest disclosed ;</l>

     <l n="133">SAID Peter , pretty work , upon my truth :—</l>
     <l n="134">Not let us see how you are made forsooth !</l>
     <l n="135">What silly scruples !— Are they in your creed ?</l>
     <l n="136">You were not always led such scenes to heed :</l>

     <l n="140">He will not eat you : come , I say , make haste :</l>
     <l n="141">Have done with haggling ; had you acted right ,</l>
     <l n="142">Ere now the parson all had finished quite .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="143">ON saying this , her garment off he took ;</l>
     <l n="144">Put on his spectacles to overlook ;</l>
     <l n="145">And parson John , without delay , began ;</l>
     <l n="146">Said he ( as o'er her person now he ran ) ,</l>
     <l n="147">This part umbilical will make the mare</l>
     <l n="148">A noble breast , and strength at once declare :</l>
     <l n="149">Then further on the pastor placed his hand ,</l>
     <l n="150">While , with the other , ( as a magick wand ,)</l>
     <l n="151">He set about transforming mounts of snow ;</l>
     <l n="152">That in our climes a genial warmth bestow ,</l>
     <l n="153">And semi-globes are called , while those that rise</l>

     <l n="155">Are seldom mentioned , through respect no doubt ,</l>
     <l n="156">But these howe'er the parson , quite devout ,</l>
     <l n="157">Would not neglect , and whatsoe'er he felt ,</l>
     <l n="158">He always named , and on its beauties dwelt ;</l>
     <l n="159">The ceremony this , it seems , required ,</l>
     <l n="160">And fully ev'ry movement John admired .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="161">PROCEEDINGS so minute gave Peter pain ,</l>
     <l n="162">And as he could not see the rector gain</l>
     <l n="163">The slightest change , he prayed the pow'rs divine ,</l>
     <l n="164">To give assistance to the priest 's design ;</l>
     <l n="165">But this was vain , since all the magick spell ,</l>
     <l n="166">In metamorphosing the lady well ,</l>
     <l n="167">Depended on the fixing of the tail ;</l>
     <l n="168">Without this ornament the whole would fail .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="169">To set it on the parson hastened now ,</l>
     <l n="170">When Neighbour Peter ‘ gan to knit his brow ,</l>
     <l n="171">And bawled so loud , you might have heard him far :</l>
     <l n="172">No tail , said he , I 'll have : there 'll be a scar ;</l>
     <l n="173">You put it on too low ; but vain his cries ,</l>
     <l n="174">The husband 's diligence would not suffice ,</l>
     <l n="175">For , spite of ev'ry effort , much was done ,</l>
     <l n="176">And John completely his career had run ,</l>
     <l n="177">If Peter had not pulled the rector 's gown ,</l>
     <l n="178">Who hastily replied , thou ninny , clown ;</l>
     <l n="179">Did I not tell thee silence to observe ,</l>
     <l n="180">And not a footstep from thy station swerve ?</l>
     <l n="181">The whole is spoiled , insufferable elf !</l>
     <l n="182">And for it thou hast got to thank thyself .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="183">THE husband , while the holy pastor spoke ,</l>
     <l n="184">Appeared to grumble and his stars invoke .</l>
     <l n="185">The wife was in a rage , and ‘ gan to scold :</l>

     <l n="188">Come not to me and bray and hope relief ,</l>
     <l n="189">The worthy pastor would have us procured</l>
     <l n="190">The means that might much comfort have ensured .</l>
     <l n="191">Can he deserve such treatment to receive ?</l>
     <l n="192">Good Mister John this goose I now would leave ,</l>
     <l n="193">And ev'ry morning , while he gathers fruits ,</l>
     <l n="194">Or plants , herbs , cabbages , and various roots ,</l>
     <l n="195">Without averting him , pray , here repair ,</l>
     <l n="196">You 'll soon transform me to a charming mare .</l>
