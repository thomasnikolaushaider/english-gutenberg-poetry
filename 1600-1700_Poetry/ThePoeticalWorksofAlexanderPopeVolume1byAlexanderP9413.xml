    <docTitle><titlePart>THE POETICAL WORKS OF ALEXANDER POPE VOL . I . With Memoir , Critical Dissertation , and Explanatory Notes by THE REV . GEORGE GILFILLAN M. DCCC. LVI . LIFE OF ALEXANDER POPE Alexander Pope was born in Lombard Street , London , on the 21st of May 1688 — the year of the Revolution . His father was a linen-merchant , in thriving circumstances , and said to have noble blood in his veins . His mother was Edith or Editha Turner , daughter of William Turner , Esq ., of York . Mr Carruthers , in his excellent Life of the Poet , mentions that there was an Alexander Pope , a clergyman , in the remote parish of Reay , in Caithness , who rode all the way to Twickenham to pay his great namesake a visit , and was presented by him with a copy of the subscription edition of the “ Odyssey , ” in five volumes quarto , which is still preserved by his descendants . Pope 's father had made about L10 , 000 by trade ; but being a Roman Catholic , and fond of a country life , he retired from business shortly after the Revolution , at the early age of forty-six . He resided first at Kensington , and then in Binfield , in the neighbourhood of Windsor Forest . He is said to have put his money in a strong box , and to have lived on the principal . His great delight was in his garden ; and both he and his wife seem to have cherished the warmest interest in their son , who was very delicate in health , and their only child . Pope 's study is still preserved in Binfield ; and on the lawn , a cypress-tree which he is said to have planted , is pointed out .</titlePart></docTitle>

  <body>
   <p>Pope was a premature and precocious child . His figure was deformed — his back humped — his stature short ( four feet ) — his legs and arms disproportionably long . He was sometimes compared to a spider , and sometimes to a windmill . The only mark of genius lay in his bright and piercing eye . He was sickly in constitution , and required and received great tenderness and care . Once , when three years old , he narrowly escaped from an angry cow , but was wounded in the throat . He was remarkable as a child for his amiable temper ; and from the sweetness of his voice , received the name of the Little Nightingale . His aunt gave him his first lessons in reading , and he soon became an enthusiastic lover of books ; and by copying printed characters , taught himself to write . When eight years old , he was placed under the care of the family priest , one Bannister , who taught him the Latin and Greek grammars together . He was next removed to a Catholic seminary at Twyford , near Winchester ; and while there , read Ogilby 's “ Homer ” and Sandys 's “ Ovid ” with great delight . He had not been long at this school till he wrote a severe lampoon , of two hundred lines ’ length , on his master — so truly was the “ boy the father of the man ” — for which demi-Dunciad he was severely flogged . His father , offended at this , removed him to a London school , kept by a Mr Deane . This man taught the poet nothing ; but his residence in London gave him the opportunity of attending the theatres . With these he was so captivated , that he wrote a kind of play , which was acted by his schoolfellows , consisting of speeches from Ogilby 's “ Iliad , ” tacked together with verses of his own . He became acquainted with Dryden 's works , and went to Wills 's coffee-house to see him . He says , “ Virgilium tantum vidi . ” Such transient meetings of literary orbs are among the most interesting passages in biography . Thus met Galileo with Milton , Milton with Dryden , Dryden with Pope , and Burns with Scott . Carruthers strikingly remarks , “ Considering the perils and uncertainties of a literary life — its precarious rewards , feverish anxieties , mortifications , and disappointments , joined to the tyranny of the Tonsons and Lintots , and the malice and envy of dunces , all of which Dryden had long and bitterly experienced — the aged poet could hardly have looked at the delicate and deformed boy , whose preternatural acuteness and sensibility were seen in his dark eyes , without a feeling approaching to grief , had he known that he was to fight a battle like that under which he was himself then sinking , even though the Temple of Fame should at length open to receive him . ” At twelve , he wrote the “ Ode to Solitude ; ” and shortly after , his satirical piece on Elkanah Settle , and some of his translations and imitations . His next period , he says , was in Windsor Forest , where for several years he did nothing but read the classics and indite poetry . He wrote a tragedy , a comedy , and four books of an Epic called “ Alexander , ” all of which afterwards he committed to the flames . He translated also a portion of Statius , and Cicero “ De Senectute , ” and “ thought himself the greatest genius that ever was . ” His father encouraged him in his studies , and when his verses did not please him , sent him back to “ new turn ” them , saying , “ These are not good rhymes . ” His principal favourites were Virgil 's “ Eclogues , ” in Latin ; and in English , Spencer , Waller , and Dryden — admiring Spencer , we presume , for his luxuriant fancy , Waller for his smooth versification , and Dryden for his vigorous sense and vivid sarcasm . In the Forest , he became acquainted with Sir William Trumbull , the retired secretary of state , a man of general accomplishments , who read , rode , conversed with the youthful poet ; introduced him to old Wycherley , the dramatist ; and was of material service to his views . With Wycherley , who was old , doted , and excessively vain , Pope did not continue long intimate . A coldness , springing from some criticisms which the youth ventured to make on the veteran 's poetry , crept in between them . Walsh of Abberley , in Worcestershire , a man of good sense and taste , became , after a perusal of the “ Pastorals ” in MS ., a warm friend and kind adviser of Pope 's , who has immortalised him in more than one of his poems . Walsh told Pope that there had never hitherto appeared in Britain a poet who was at once great and correct , and exhorted him to aim at accuracy and elegance .</p>
   <p>When fifteen , he visited London , in order to acquire a more thorough knowledge of French and Italian . At sixteen , he wrote the “ Pastorals , ” and a portion of “ Windsor Forest , ” although they were not published for some time afterwards . By his incessant exertions , he now began to feel his constitution injured . He imagined himself dying , and sent farewell letters to all his friends , including the Abbe Southcot . This gentleman communicated Pope 's case to Dr Ratcliffe , who gave him some medical directions ; by following which , the poet recovered . He was advised to relax in his studies , and to ride daily ; and he prudently followed the advice . Many years afterwards , he repaid the benevolent Abbe by procuring for him , through Sir Robert Walpole , the nomination to an abbey in Avignon . This is only one of many proofs that , notwithstanding his waspish temper , and his no small share of malice as well as vanity , there was a warm heart in our poet .</p>
   <p>In 1707 , Pope became acquainted with Michael Blount of Maple , Durham , near Reading ; whose two sisters , Martha and Teresa , he has commemorated in various verses . On his connexion with these ladies , some mystery rests . Bowles has strongly and plausibly urged that it was not of the purest or most creditable order . Others have contended that it did not go further than the manners of the age sanctioned ; and they say , “ a much greater license in conversation and in epistolary correspondence was permitted between the sexes than in our decorous age ! ” We are not careful to try and settle such a delicate question — only we are inclined to suspect , that when common decency quits the words of male and female parties in their mutual communications , it is a very ample charity that can suppose it to adhere to their actions . And nowhere do we find grosser language than in some of Pope 's prose epistles to the Blounts .</p>
   <p>His “ Pastorals , ” after having been handed about in MS ., and shewn to such reputed judges as Lord Halifax , Lord Somers , Garth , Congreve , &amp; c ., were at last , in 1709 , printed in the sixth volume of Tonson 's “ Miscellanies . ” Like all well-finished commonplaces , they were received with instant and universal applause . It is humiliating to contrast the reception of these empty echoes of inspiration , these agreeable centos , with that of such genuine , although faulty poems , as Keat 's “ Endymion , ” Shelley 's “ Queen Mab , ” and Wordsworth 's “ Lyrical Ballads . ” Two years later , ( in 1711 ) , a far better and more characteristic production from his pen was ushered anonymously into the world . This was the “ Essay on Criticism , ” a work which he had first written in prose , and which discovers a ripeness of judgment , a clearness of thought , a condensation of style , and a command over the information he possesses , worthy of any age in life , and almost of any mind in time . It serves , indeed , to shew what Pope 's true forte was . That lay not so much in poetry , as in the knowledge of its principles and laws ,— not so much in creation , as in criticism . He was no Homer or Shakspeare ; but he might have been nearly as acute a judge of poetry as Aristotle , and nearly as eloquent an expounder of the rules of art and the glories of genius as Longinus .</p>
   <p>In the same year , Pope printed “ The Rape of the Lock , ” in a volume of Miscellanies . Lord Petre had , much in the way described by the poet , stolen a lock of Miss Belle Fermor 's hair ,— a feat which led to an estrangement between the families . Pope set himself to reconcile them by this beautiful poem ,— a poem which has embalmed at once the quarrel and the reconciliation to all future time . In its first version , the machinery was awanting , the “ lock ” was a desert , the “ rape ” a natural event ,— the small infantry of sylphs and gnomes were slumbering uncreated in the poet 's mind ; but in the next edition he contrived to introduce them in a manner so easy and so exquisite , as to remind you of the variations which occur in dreams , where one wonder seems softly to slide into the bosom of another , and where beautiful and fantastic fancies grow suddenly out of realities , like the bud from the bough , or the fairy-seeming wing of the summer-cloud from the stern azure of the heavens .</p>
   <p>A little after this , Pope became acquainted with a far greater , better , and truer man than himself , Joseph Addison . Warburton , and others , have sadly misrepresented the connexion between these two famous wits , as well as their relative intellectual positions . Addison was a more amiable and childlike person than Pope . He had much more , too , of the Christian . He was not so elaborately polished and furbished as the author of “ The Rape of the Lock ; ” but he had , naturally , a finer and richer genius . Pope found early occasion for imagining Addison his disguised enemy . He gave him a hint of his intention to introduce the machinery into “ The Rape of the Lock . ” Of this , Addison disapproved , and said it was a delicious little thing already — merum sal . This , Pope , and some of his friends , have attributed to jealousy ; but it is obvious that Addison could not foresee the success with which the machinery was to be managed , and did foresee the difficulties connected with tinkering such an exquisite production . We may allude here to the circumstances which , at a later date , produced an estrangement between these celebrated men . When Tickell , Addison 's friend , published the first book of the “ Iliad , ” in opposition to Pope 's version , Addison gave it the preference . This moved Pope 's indignation , and led him to assert that it was Addison 's own composition . In this conjecture he was supported by Edward Young , who had known Tickell long and intimately , and had never heard of him having written at college , as was averred , this translation . It is now , however , we believe , certain , from the MS. which still exists , that Tickell was the real author . A coldness , from this date , began between Pope and Addison . An attempt to reconcile them only made matters worse ; and at last the breach was rendered irremediable by Pope 's writing the famous character of his rival , afterwards inserted in the Prologue to the Satires ,— a portrait drawn with the perfection of polished malice and bitter sarcasm , but which seems more a caricature than a likeness . Whatever Addison 's faults , his conduct to Pope did not deserve such a return . The whole passage is only one of those painful incidents which disgrace the history of letters , and prove how much spleen , ingratitude , and baseness often co-exist with the highest parts . The words of Pope are as true now as ever they were — “ the life of a wit is a warfare upon earth ; ” and a warfare in which poisoned missiles and every variety of falsehood are still common . We may also here mention , that while the friendship of Pope and Addison lasted , the former contributed the well-known prologue to the latter 's “ Cato . ”</p>
   <p>One of Pope 's most intimate friends in his early days was Henry Cromwell — a distant relative of the great Oliver — a gentleman of fortune , gallantry , and literary taste , who became his agreeable and fascinating , but somewhat dangerous , companion . He is supposed to have initiated Pope into some of the fashionable follies of the town . At this time , Pope 's popularity roused one of his most formidable foes against him . This was that Cobbett of criticism , old John Dennis ,— a man of strong natural powers , much learning , and a rich , coarse vein of humour ; but irascible , vindictive , vain , and capricious . Pope had provoked him by an attack in his “ Essay on Criticism , ” and the savage old man revenged himself by a running fire of fierce diatribes against that “ Essay ” and “ The Rape of the Lock . ” Pope waited till Dennis had committed himself by a powerful but furious assault on Addison 's “ Cato ” ( most of which Johnson has preserved in his Life of Pope ) ; and then , partly to court Addison , and partly to indulge his spleen at the critic , wrote a prose satire , entitled , “ The Narrative of Dr Robert Norris on the Frenzy of J. D . ” In this , however , he overshot the mark ; and Addison signified to him that he was displeased with the spirit of his narrative ,— an intimation which Pope keenly resented . This scornful dog would not eat the dirty pudding that was graciously flung to him ; and Pope found that , without having conciliated Addison , he had made Dennis 's furnace of hate against himself seven times hotter than before .</p>
   <p>In 1712 appeared “ The Messiah , ” “ The Dying Christian to his Soul , ” “ The Temple of Fame , ” and the “ Elegy on the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady . ” Her story is still involved in mystery . Her name is said to have been Wainsbury . She was attached to a lover above her degree ,— some say to the Duke of Berry , whom she had met in her early youth in France . In despair of obtaining her desire , she hanged herself . It is curious , if true , that she was as deformed in person as Pope himself . Her family seems to have been noble . In 1713 , he published “ Windsor Forest , ” an “ Ode on St Cecilia 's Day , ” and several papers in the Guardian — one of them being an exquisitely ironical paper , comparing Phillip 's pastorals with his own , and affecting to give them the preference — the extracts being so selected as to damage his rival 's claims . This year , also , he wrote , although he did not publish , his fine epistle to Jervas , the painter . Pope was passionately fond of the art of painting , and practised it a good deal under Jervas 's instructions , although he did not reach great proficiency . The prodigy has yet to be born who combines the characters of a great painter and a great poet .</p>
   <p>About this time , Pope commenced preparations for the great work of translating Homer ; and subscription-papers , accordingly , were issued . Dean Swift was now in England , and took a deep interest in the success of this undertaking , recommending it in coffee-houses , and introducing the subject and Pope 's name to the leading Tories . Pope met the Dean for the first time in Berkshire , where , in one of his fits of savage disgust at the conflicting parties of the period , he had retired to the house of a clergyman , and an intimacy commenced which was only terminated by death . We have often regretted that Pope had not selected some author more suitable to his genius than Homer . Horace or Lucretius , or even Ovid , would have been more congenial . His imitations of Horace shew us what he might have made of a complete translation . What a brilliant thing a version of Lucretius , in the style of the “ Essay on Man , ” would have been ! And his “ Rape of the Lock ” proves that he had considerable sympathy with the elaborate fancy , although not with the meretricious graces of Ovid . But with Homer , the severely grand , the simple , the warlike , the lover and painter of all Nature 's old original forms — the ocean , the mountains , and the stars — what thorough sympathy could a man have who never saw a real mountain or a battle , and whose enthusiasm for scenery was confined to purling brooks , trim gardens , artificial grottos , and the shades of Windsor Forest ? Accordingly , his Homer , although a beautiful and sparkling poem , is not a satisfactory translation of the “ Iliad , ” and still less of the “ Odyssey . ” He has trailed along the naked lances of the Homeric lines so many flowers and leaves that you can hardly recognise them , and feel that their point is deadened and their power gone . This at least is our opinion ; although many to this day continue to admire these translations , and have even said that if they are not Homer , they are something better .</p>
   <p>The “ Iliad ” took him six years , and was a work which cost him much anxiety as well as labour , the more as his scholarship was far from profound . He was assisted in the undertaking by Parnell ( who wrote the Life of Homer ) , by Broome , Jortin , and others . The first volume appeared in June 1715 , and the other volumes followed at irregular intervals . He began it in 1712 , his twenty-fifth year , and finished it in 1718 , his thirtieth year . Previous to its appearance , his remuneration for his poems had been small , and his circumstances were embarrassed ; but the result of the subscription , which amounted to L5320 , 4s ., rendered him independent for life .</p>
   <p>While at Binfield , he had often visited London ; and there , in the society of Howe , Garth , Parnell , and the rest , used to indulge in occasional excesses , which did his feeble constitution no good ; and once , according to Colley Cibber , he narrowly escaped a serious scrape in a house of a certain description ,— Colley , by his own account , “ helping out the tomtit for the sake of Homer ! ” This statement , indeed , Pope has denied ; but his veracity was by no means his strongest point . After writing a “ Farewell to London , ” he retired , in 1715 , to Twickenham , along with his parents ; and remained there , cultivating his garden , digging his grottos , and diversifying his walks , till the end of his days .</p>
   <p>Some years before , he had become acquainted with Lady Mary Wortley Montague , the most brilliant woman of her age — witty , fascinating , beautiful , and accomplished — full of enterprise and spirit , too , although decidedly French in her tastes , manners , and character . Pope fell violently in love with her , and had her undoubtedly in his eye when writing “ Eloisa and Abelard , ” which he did at Oxford in 1716 , shortly after her going abroad , and which appeared the next year . His passion was not requited ,— nay , was treated with contempt and ridicule ; and he became in after years a bitter enemy and foul-mouthed detractor of the lady , although after her return , in 1718 , she resided near him at Twickenham , and they seemed outwardly on good terms .</p>
   <p>In 1717 , and the succeeding year , Pope lost successively his father , Parnell , Garth , and Rowe , and bitterly felt their loss . He finished , as we have seen , the “ Iliad ” in 1718 ; but the fifth and sixth volumes , which were the last , did not appear till 1720 . Its success , which at the time was triumphant , roused against him the whole host of envy and detraction . Dennis , and all Grub Street with him , were moved to assail him . Pamphlets after pamphlets were published , all of which , after reading with writhing anguish , Pope had the resolution to bind up into volumes — a great collection of calumny , which he preserved , probably , for purposes of future revenge . His own friends , on the other hand , hailed his work with applause ,— Gay writing a most graceful and elegant poem , in ottava rima , entitled , “ Mr Pope 's Welcome Home from Greece , ” in which his different friends are pictured as receiving him home on the shores of Britain , after an absence of six years . Bentley , that stern old Grecian , avoided the extremes of a howling Grub Street on the one hand , and a flattering aristocracy on the other , and expressed what is , we think , the just opinion when he said , “ It is a pretty poem , but it is not Homer . ”</p>
   <p>In 1721 , he issued a selection from the poems of Parnell , and prefixed a very beautiful dedication to the Earl of Oxford , commencing with —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Such were the notes thy once-loved poet sung ,</l>
     <l n="2">Till death untimely stopp 'd his tuneful tongue .</l>
     <l n="3">Oh , just beheld and lost , admired and mourn 'd ,</l>
     <l n="4">With softest manners , gentlest arts adorn 'd ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In 1722 , he engaged to translate the “ Odyssey . ” He employed Broome and Fenton as his assistants in the work ; and the portions translated by them were thought as good as his . He remunerated them very handsomely . Of this work , the first three quarto volumes appeared in 1725 ; and the fourth and fifth , which completed the work , the following year . Pope sold the copyright to Lintot for L600 .</p>
   <p>He was busy at this time , too , with an edition of Shakspeare ,— not quite worthy of either poet . It appeared in six volumes , quarto , in 1725 . His preface was good , but he was deficient in antiquarian lore ; and his mortification was extreme when Theobald , destined to figure in “ The Dunciad , ” a mere plodding hack , not only in his “ Shakspeare Restored , ” exposed many blunders in Pope 's edition ; but issued , some years afterwards , an edition of his own , which was much better received by the public .</p>
   <p>In 1726 , there was a great gathering of the Tory wits at Twickenham . Swift had come from Ireland , and resided for some time with Pope . Bolingbroke came over occasionally from Dawley ; and Gay was often there to laugh with , and be laughed at by , the rest . Swift had “ Gulliver 's Travels ” — the most ingenious and elaborate libel against man and God ever written — in his pocket , nearly ready for publication ; and we may conceive the grim , sardonic smile with which he read it to his friends , and their tumultuous mirth . Gay was projecting his “ Beggars ’ Opera , ” and Pope preparing some of his witty “ Miscellanies . ” At the end of two months , the Dean was hurried home by the tidings of Stella 's illness . He left the “ Travels ” behind him , for the copyright of which Pope procured L300 ,— a sum counted then very large , and which Swift generously handed over to Pope .</p>
   <p>In September this year , when returning in Lord Bolingbroke 's coach from Dawley , the poet was overturned in a little rivulet near Twickenhan , and nearly drowned . The unfortunate little man ! One is reminded of Gulliver 's accident in the Brobdignagian cream-pot . In trying to break the glasses of the coach , which were down , he severely cut his right hand , and lost the use of two of his fingers ,— an addition to his other deformities not very desirable ; and we suspect that Pope thought Voltaire ( who had met him at Bolingbroke 's ) but a miserable comforter , when , in a letter of pretended condolence , he asked — “ Is it possible that those fingers which have written ‘ The Rape of the Lock , ’ and dressed Homer so becomingly in an English coat , should have been so barbarously treated ? Let the hand of Dennis or of your poetasters be cut off ; yours is sacred . ” It was perhaps in keeping that those mutilated fingers were soon to be employed in attacking Dennis , and that the embittered poet was about , with the half of his hand , but with the whole of his heart , to write “ The Dunciad . ”</p>
   <p>In the end of April 1727 , we find Swift again in Twickenham , where his irritation at the continued ascendancy of Sir Robert Walpole served to infuse more venom into the “ Miscellanies ” concocted between him and Pope ,— two volumes of which appeared in June this year . Gay , also , and the ingenious and admirable Dr Arbuthnot , contributed their quota to these volumes . Swift speedily fell ill with that giddiness and deafness which were the avant-couriers of his final malady ; and in August he left Twickenham , and in October , London and England , for ever .</p>
   <p>In these “ Miscellanies ” there appeared the famous “ Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus , ” written chiefly by Pope , in which he lashed the various proficients in the bathos , under the names of flying fishes , swallows , parrots , frogs , eels , &amp; c ., and appended the initials of well-known authors to each head . This roused Grub Street , whose malice had nearly fallen asleep , into fresh fury , and he was bitterly assailed in every possible form . Like Hyder Ali , he now — to travesty Burke — “ in the recesses of a mind capacious of such things , determined to leave all Duncedom an everlasting monument of vengeance , and became at length so confident of his force , so collected in his might , that he made no secret whatever of his dreadful resolution , but , compounding all the materials of fun , sarcasm , irony , and invective , into one black cloud , he hung for a while on the declivities of Richmond Hill ; and whilst the authors were idly and stupidly gazing on this menacing meteor which blackened all their horizon , it suddenly burst and poured down the whole of its contents on the garrets of Grub Street . Then issued a scene of ( ludicrous ) woe , the like of which no eye had seen , no heart conceived , and which no tongue can adequately tell . All the horrors of literary war before known or heard of — ( MacFlecknoe , the Rehearsal , &amp; c .) — were mercy to the new tempest of havoc which burst from the brain of this remorseless poet . A storm of universal laughter filled every bookseller 's shop , and penetrated into the remotest attics . The miserable dunces , in part , were stricken mad with rage — in part , dumb with consternation . Some fled for refuge to ale , and others to ink ; while not a few fell , or feared to fall , into the ‘ jaws of famine . ’ ” This singular poem was written in 1727 . It was first printed surreptitiously ( i. e ., with the connivance of the author ) in Dublin , and then reprinted in London . The first perfect edition , however , did not appear in London till 1729 . On the day of its publication , according to Pope , a crowd of authors besieged the publisher 's shop ; and by entreaties , threats , nay , cries of treason , tried to hinder its appearance . What a scene it must have been — of teeth gnashing above ragged coats , and eyes glaring through old periwigs — of faces livid with famine and ferocity ; while , to complete the confusion , hawkers , booksellers , and even lords , were mixed with the crowd , clamouring for its issue ! And as , says Pope , “ there is no stopping a torrent with a finger , out it came . ” The consequence he had foreseen . A universal howl of rage and pain burst from the aggrieved dunces , on whose naked sides the hot pitch had fallen . They pushed their rejoinders beyond the limits of civilised literary warfare ; and although Pope had been coarse in his language , they were coarser far , and their blackguardism was not redeemed by wit or genius . Pope felt , or seemed to feel , entire indifference as to these assaults . On some of them , indeed , he could afford to look down with contempt , on account of their obvious animus and gross language . Others , again , were neutralised by the fact , that their authors had provoked reprisals by their previous insults or ingratitude to Pope . Many , however , were too obscure for his notice ; and some , such as Aaron Hill and Bentley , did not deserve to be classed with the Theobalds and Ralphs . To Hill , he , after some finessing , was compelled to make an apology . Altogether , although this production increased Pope 's fame , and the conception of his power , it did not tend to shew him in the most amiable light , or perhaps to promote his own comfort or peace of mind . After having emptied out his bile in “ The Dunciad , ” he ought to have become mellower in temper , and resigned satire for ever . He continued , on the contrary , as ill-natured as before ; and although he afterwards flew at higher game , the iron had entered into his soul , and he remained a satirist , and therefore an unhappy man , for life .</p>
   <p>In 1731 appeared an “ Epistle on Taste , ” which was very favourably received ; only his enemies accused him of having satirised the Duke of Chandos in it ,— a man who had befriended Pope , and had lent him money . Pope denied the charge , although it is very possible , both from his own temperament , and from the frequent occurrence of similar cases of baseness in literary life , that it may have been true . Nothing is more common than for those who have been most liberally helped , to become first the secret , and then the open , enemies of their benefactors . In 1732 appeared his epistle on “ The Use of Riches , ” addressed to Lord Bathurst . These two epistles were afterwards incorporated in his “ Moral Essays . ”</p>
   <p>As far back as 1725 , Pope had been revolving the subject of the “ Essay on Man ; ” and , indeed , some of its couplets remind you of “ pebbles which had long been rolled over and polished in the ocean of his mind . ” It has been asserted , but not proved , that Lord Bolingbroke gave him the outline of this essay in prose . It is unquestionable , indeed , that Bolingbroke exercised influence over Pope 's mind , and may have suggested some of the thoughts in the Essay ; but it is not probable that a man like Pope would have set himself on such a subject simply to translate from another 's mind . He published the first epistle of the Essay , in 1732 , anonymously , as an experiment , and had the satisfaction to see it successful . It was received with rapture , and passed through several editions ere the author was known ; although we must say that the value of this reception is considerably lessened , when we remember that the critics could not have been very acute who did not detect Pope 's “ fine Roman hand ” in every sentence of this brilliant but most unsatisfactory and shallow performance .</p>
   <p>In the same year died dear , simple-minded Gay , who found in Pope a sincere mourner , and an elegant elegiast ; and on the 7th of June 1733 , expired good old Mrs Pope , at the age of ninety-four . Pope , who had always been a dutiful son , erected an obelisk in his own grounds to her memory , with a simple but striking inscription in Latin . During this year , he published the third part of the “ Essay on Man , ” an epistle to Lord Cobham , On the Knowledge and Characters of Man , and an Imitation of the First Satire of the Second Book of Horace . In this last , he attacks , in the most brutal style , his former love Lady Mary W. Montague , who replied in a piece of coarse cleverness , entitled , “ Verses to the Imitator of the First Satire of the Second Book of Horace , ” — verses in which she was assisted by Lord Harvey , another of Pope 's victims . He wrote , but was prudent enough to suppress , an ironical reply .</p>
   <p>In 1734 appeared his very clever and highly-finished epistle to Dr Arbuthnot ( now entitled the “ Prologue to the Satires ” ) , who was then languishing toward death . Arbuthnot , from his deathbed , solemnly advised Pope to regulate his satire , and seems to have been afraid of his personal safety from his numerous foes . Pope replied in a manly but self-defensive style . He is said about this time to have in his walks carried arms , and had a large dog as his protector ; but none of the dunces had courage enough to assail him . Dennis , who was no dunce , might have ventured on it — but he had become miserably infirm , poor , and blind ; and Pope had heaped coals of fire on his head , by contributing a Prologue to a play which was acted for his behoof .</p>
   <p>Our author 's life becomes now little else than a record of multiplying labours and increasing infirmities . In 1734 appeared the fourth part of the “ Essay on Man , ” and the Second Satire of the Second Book of Horace . In 1735 were issued his “ Characters of Women : An Epistle to a Lady ” ( Martha Blount ) . In this appears his famous character of Atossa — the Duchess of Marlborough . It is said — we fear too truly — that these lines being shewn to her Grace , as a character of the Duchess of Buckingham , she recognised in them her own likeness , and bribed Pope with a thousand pounds to suppress it . He did so religiously — as long as she was alive — and then published it ! In the same year he printed a second volume of his “ Miscellaneous Works , ” in folio and quarto , uniform with the “ Iliad ” and “ Odyssey , ” including a versification of the Satires of Donne ; also , anonymously , a production disgraceful to his memory , entitled , “ Sober Advice from Horace to the Young Gentlemen about Town , ” in which he commits many gross indecorums of language , and annexes the name of the great Bentley to several indecent notes . It is said that Bentley , when he read the pamphlet , cried , “ ‘ Tis an impudent dog , but I talked against his Homer , and the portentous cub never forgives . ”</p>
   <p>The “ Essay on Man ” and the “ Moral Epistles ” were designed to be parts of a great system of ethics , which Pope had long revolved in his mind , and wished to incarnate in poetry . At this time occurred the strange , mysterious circumstances connected with the publication of his letters . It seems that , in 1729 , Pope had recalled from his correspondents the letters he had written them , of many of which he had kept no copies . He was induced to this by the fact , that after Henry Cromwell 's death , his mistress , Mrs Thomas , who was in indigent circumstances , had sold the letters which had passed between Pope and her keeper , to Curll the bookseller , who had published them without scruple . When Pope obtained his correspondence , he , according to his own statement , burned a great many and laid past the others , after having had a copy of them taken , and deposited in Lord Oxford 's library . And his charge against Curll was , that he obtained surreptitiously some of these letters , and published them without Pope 's consent . But , ere we come to the circumstances of the publication , several other things require to be noticed . In 1733 , Curll , anxious to publish a Life of Pope , advertised for information ; and , in consequence , one P. T ., who professed to be an old friend of Pope 's and his father 's , wrote Curll a letter , giving an account of Pope 's ancestry , which tallied exactly with what Pope himself , in a note to one of his poems , furnished the following year . P. T ., in a second letter , offered to the publisher a large collection of Pope 's letters , and inclosed a copy of an advertisement he had drawn out to be published by Curll . Strange as it seems , Curll took no notice of the proposal till 1735 , when , having accidentally turned up a copy of P. T . ' s advertisement , he sent it to Pope , with a letter requesting an interview , and mentioning that he had some papers of P. T . ' s in reference to his family history , which he would shew him . Pope replied by three advertisements in the papers , denying all knowledge of P. T . or his collection of letters or MSS . P. T . then wrote Curll that he had printed the letters at his own expense , seeking a sum of money for them , and appointing an interview at a tavern to shew him the sheets . This was countermanded the next day , P. T . professing to be afraid of Pope and his “ bravoes , ” although how Pope was to know of this meeting was , according to Curll , “ the cream of the jest . ”</p>
   <p>Soon after , a round , fat man , with a clergyman 's gown and a barrister 's band , called on Curll , at ten o'clock at night . He said his name was Smith , that he was a cousin of P. T . ' s , and shewed the book in sheets , along with about a dozen of the original letters . After a good deal of negotiation with this personage , Curll obtained fifty copies of P. T . ' s printed copies , and issued a flaming advertisement announcing the publication of Pope 's letters for thirty years , and stating that the original MSS . were lying at his shop , and might be seen by any who chose ,— although not a single MS. seems to have been delivered . Smith , the day that the advertisement appeared , handed over , for a sum of money , about three hundred volumes to Curll . But as in the advertisement it was stated that various letters of lords were included , and as there is a law amongst regulations of the Upper House that no peer 's letters can be published without his consent , at the instance of the Earl of Jersey , and in consequence , too , of an advertisement of Pope 's , the books were seized , and Curll , and the printer of the paper where the advertisement appeared , were ordered to appear at the bar for breach of privilege . P. T . wrote Curll to tell him to conceal all that passed between him and the publisher , and promising him more valuable letters still . Curll , however , told the whole story ; and as , when the books were examined , not a single lord 's letter was found among them , Curll was acquitted , his books restored to him , the lords saying that they had been made the tools of Pope ; and he proceeded to advertise the correspondence , in terms most insulting to Pope , who now felt himself compelled (! ) to print , by subscription , his genuine letters , which , when printed , turned out , strange to tell , to be identical with those published by the rapacious bookseller ! On viewing the whole transaction , we incline with Johnson , Warton , Bowles , Macaulay , and Carruthers , to look upon it as one of Pope 's ape-like stratagems — to believe that P. T . was himself , Smith his agent , and that his objects were partly to outwit Curll , to mystify the public , to gratify that strange love of manoeuvring which dwelt as strongly in him as in any match-making mamma , and to attract interest and attention to the genuine correspondence when it should appear . Pope , it was said , could not “ drink tea without a stratagem , ” and far less publish his correspondence without a series of contemptible tricks — tricks , however , in which he was true to his nature — that being a curious compound of the woman and the wit , the monkey and the genius<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>.</p>
   <p>In 1737 , four of his Imitations of Horace were published , and in the next year appeared two Dialogues , each entitled “ 1738 , ” which now form the Epilogue to the Satires . One of them was issued on the same day with Johnson 's “ London . ” In that year , too , he published his “ Universal Prayer , ” — a singular specimen of latitudinarian thought , expressed in a loose simplicity of language , quite unusual with its author . The next year he had intended to signalise by a third Dialogue , which he commenced in a vigorous style , but which he did not finish , owing to the dread of a prosecution before the Lords ; and with the exception of letters ( one of them interesting , as his last to Swift ) , his pen was altogether idle . In 1740 , he did nothing but edit an edition of select Italian Poets . This year , Crousaz , a Swiss professor of note , having attacked ( we think most justly ) the “ Essay on Man ” as a mere Pagan prolusion — a thin philosophical smile cast on the Gordian knot of the mystery of the universe , instead of a sword cutting , or trying to cut , it in sunder — Warburton , a man of much talent and learning , but of more astuteness and anxiety to exalt himself , came forward to the rescue , and , with a mixture of casuistical cunning and real ingenuity , tried , as some one has it , “ to make Pope a Christian , ” although , even in Warburton 's hands , like the dying Donald Bane in “ Waverley , ” he “ makes but a queer Christian after all ; ” and his system , essentially Pantheistic , contrives to ignore the grand Scripture principles of a Fall , of a Divine Redeemer , of a Future World , and the glorious light or darkness which these and other Christian doctrines cast upon the Mystery of Man . If , however , Warburton , with all his scholastic subtlety , failed to make Pope a Christian , he made him a warm friend ; Allen , Pope 's acquaintance , a rich father-in-law ; and himself , by and by , the Bishop of Gloucester . Sophistry has seldom , although sometimes , been thus richly rewarded .</p>
   <p>The last scene of Pope 's tiny and tortured existence was now at hand . But ere it closed , it must close like Dryden 's , characteristically , with an author 's quarrel . Colley Cibber had long been a favourite of Pope 's ire , and had as often retorted scorn , till at last , by laughing upon the stage at Pope 's play ( partly Gay 's ) , entitled , “ Three Hours After Marriage , ” he roused the bard almost to frenzy ; and Pope set to work to remodel “ The Dunciad ; ” and , dethroning Theobald , set up Cibber as the lawful King of the Dull ,— a most unfortunate substitution , since , while Theobald was the ideal of stolid , solemn stupidity , Cibber was gay , light , pert , and clever ; full of pluck , too , and who overflowed in reply , with pamphlets which gave Pope both a headache and a heartache whenever he perused them .</p>
   <p>Pope had never been strong , and for many years the variety and multitude of his frailties had been increasing . He had habitually all his life been tormented with headaches , for which he found the steam of strong coffee the chief remedy . He had hurt his stomach , too , by indulging in excess of stimulating viands , such as potted lampreys , and in copious and frequent drams . He was assailed at last by dropsy and asthma ; and on the 30th of May 1744 , he breathed his last , fifty-six years of age . He had long , he said , “ been tired of the world , ” and died with philosophic composure and serenity . He took the sacrament according to the form of the Roman Catholic Church ; but merely , he said , because it “ looked right . ” A little before his death , he called for his desk , and began an essay on the immortality of the soul , and on those material things which tend to weaken or to strengthen it for immortality ,— enumerating generous wines as among the latter influences , and spirituous liquors among the former ! His last words were , “ There is nothing that is meritorious but virtue and friendship ; and , indeed , friendship itself is only a part of virtue . ” Thus , “ motionless and moanless , ” without a word about Christ — the slightest syllable of repentance — and with a scrap of heathen morality in his mouth , died the brilliant Alexander Pope . Who is ready to say , “ May my last end be like his ” ? His favourite Martha Blount behaved , according to some accounts , with disgusting unconcern on the occasion . So true it is , “ there is no friendship among the wicked , ” even although the heartless Bolingbroke , too , was by , and seems to have succeeded in squeezing out some crocodile tears , as he bent over the dying poet , and said , “ O God ! what is man ? ” His remains were , according to his wish , deposited in Twickenham church , near his parents , where the single letter P on the stone alone distinguishes the spot .</p>
   <p>Pope 's character , apart from his poetry , which we intend criticising in our next volume , was not specially interesting or elevated . He was a spoiled child , a small self-tormentor ,— full to bursting with petty spites , mean animosities , and unfounded jealousies . While he sought , with the fury of a pampered slave , to trample on those authors that were beneath him in rank or in popularity , he could on all occasions fawn with the sycophancy of a eunuch upon the noble , the rich , and the powerful . Hazlitt speaks of Moore as a “ pug-dog barking from the lap of a lady of quality at inferior passengers . ” The description is far more applicable to Pope . We have much allowance to make for the influence exerted on his mind by his singularly crooked frame and sickly habit of body , by his position as belonging to a proscribed faith , and by his want of training in a public school ; but after all these deductions , we cannot but deplore the spectacle of one of the finest , clearest , and sharpest minds that England ever produced , so frequently reminding you of a bright sting set in the body , and steeped in the venom , of a wasp . And yet , withal , he possessed many virtues , which endeared him to a multitude of friends . He was a kind son . He was a faithful and devoted friend . He loved , if not man , yet many men with deep tenderness . A keen politician he was not ; but , so far as he went along with his party , he was true to the common cause . In morals , he was greatly superior , in point of external decorum , to most of the wits of the time ; but in falsehood , finesse , treachery , and envy , he stood at the bottom of the list , without that plea of poverty , or wretchedness , or despair , which so many of them might have urged . Uneasy , indeed , he always , and unhappy he often , was ; but very much of his uneasiness and unhappiness sprung from his own fault . He attacked others , and could not bear to be attacked in return . He was a bully and a coward . He threw himself into a thorn-hedge , and was amazed that he came out covered with scratches and blood . While he shone in satirising many kinds of vice , he laid himself open to retort by his own want of delicacy . He , as well as Swift , was fond of alluding in his verse to polluted and forbidden things . There , and there alone , his taste deserted him ; and there is something disgusting and unnatural in the combination of the elegant and the obscene — the coarse in sentiment and the polished in style . And whatever may be said for many of the amiable traits of the Man , there is very little to be said for the general tendency — so far as healthy morality and Christian principle are concerned — of the writings of the Poet .</p>

   <p>POPE 'S POETICAL WORKS .</p>
   <p>PREFACE .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span></p>
   <p>I am inclined to think that both the writers of books , and the readers of them , are generally not a little unreasonable in their expectations . The first seem to fancy that the world must approve whatever they produce , and the latter to imagine that authors are obliged to please them at any rate . Methinks , as on the one hand , no single man is born with a right of controlling the opinions of all the rest ; so , on the other , the world has no title to demand that the whole care and time of any particular person should be sacrificed to its entertainment . Therefore I cannot but believe that writers and readers are under equal obligations for as much fame , or pleasure , as each affords the other .</p>
   <p>Every one acknowledges , it would be a wild notion to expect perfection in any work of man : and yet one would think the contrary was taken for granted , by the judgment commonly passed upon poems . A critic supposes he has done his part , if he proves a writer to have failed in an expression , or erred in any particular point : and can it then be wondered at , if the poets in general seem resolved not to own themselves in any error ? For as long as one side will make no allowances , the other will be brought to no acknowledgments .</p>
   <p>I am afraid this extreme zeal on both sides is ill-placed ; poetry and criticism being by no means the universal concern of the world , but only the affair of idle men who write in their closets , and of idle men who read there .</p>
   <p>Yet sure , upon the whole , a bad author deserves better usage than a bad critic ; for a writer 's endeavour , for the most part , is to please his readers , and he fails merely through the misfortune of an ill judgment ; but such a critic 's is to put them out of humour ,— a design he could never go upon without both that and an ill temper .</p>
   <p>I think a good deal may be said to extenuate the fault of bad poets . What we call a genius , is hard to be distinguished by a man himself from a strong inclination : and if his genius be ever so great , he cannot at first discover it any other way than by giving way to that prevalent propensity which renders him the more liable to be mistaken . The only method he has is to make the experiment by writing , and appealing to the judgment of others : now if he happens to write ill ( which is certainly no sin in itself ) he is immediately made an object of ridicule . I wish we had the humanity to reflect , that even the worst authors might , in their endeavour to please us , deserve something at our hands . We have no cause to quarrel with them but for their obstinacy in persisting to write ; and this too may admit of alleviating circumstances . Their particular friends may be either ignorant or insincere ; and the rest of the world in general is too well bred to shock them with a truth which generally their booksellers are the first that inform them of . This happens not till they have spent too much of their time to apply to any profession which might better fit their talents , and till such talents as they have are so far discredited as to be but of small service to them . For ( what is the hardest case imaginable ) the reputation of a man generally depends upon the first steps he makes in the world ; and people will establish their opinion of us from what we do at that season when we have least judgment to direct us .</p>
   <p>On the other hand , a good poet no sooner communicates his works with the same desire of information , but it is imagined he is a vain young creature given up to the ambition of fame ; when perhaps the poor man is all the while trembling with the fear of being ridiculous . If he is made to hope he may please the world , he falls under very unlucky circumstances : for , from the moment he prints , he must expect to hear no more truth than if he were a prince , or a beauty . If he has not very good sense ( and indeed there are twenty men of wit for one man of sense ) , his living thus in a course of flattery may put him in no small danger of becoming a coxcomb : if he has , he will consequently have so much diffidence as not to reap any great satisfaction from his praise ; since , if it be given to his face , it can scarce be distinguished from flattery , and if in his absence , it is hard to be certain of it . Were he sure to be commended by the best and most knowing , he is as sure of being envied by the worst and most ignorant , which are the majority ; for it is with a fine genius as with a fine fashion , all those are displeased at it who are not able to follow it : and it is to be feared that esteem will seldom do any man so much good as ill-will does him harm . Then there is a third class of people , who make the largest part of mankind , those of ordinary or indifferent capacities ; and these ( to a man ) will hate , or suspect him : a hundred honest gentlemen will dread him as a wit , and a hundred innocent women as a satirist . In a word , whatever be his fate in poetry , it is ten to one but he must give up all the reasonable aims of life for it . There are indeed some advantages accruing from a genius to poetry , and they are all I can think of : the agreeable power of self-amusement when a man is idle or alone ; the privilege of being admitted into the best company ; and the freedom of saying as many careless things as other people , without being so severely remarked upon .</p>
   <p>I believe , if any one , early in his life , should contemplate the dangerous fate of authors , he would scarce be of their number on any consideration . The life of a wit is a warfare upon earth ; and the present spirit of the learned world is such , that to attempt to serve it ( any way ) one must have the constancy of a martyr , and a resolution to suffer for its sake . I could wish people would believe , what I am pretty certain they will not , that I have been much less concerned about fame than I durst declare till this occasion , when methinks I should find more credit than I could heretofore : since my writings have had their fate already , and it is too late to think of prepossessing the reader in their favour . I would plead it as some merit in me , that the world has never been prepared for these trifles by prefaces , biased by recommendations , dazzled with the names of great patrons , wheedled with fine reasons and pretences , or troubled with excuses . I confess it was want of consideration that made me an author ; I writ because it amused me ; I corrected because it was as pleasant to me to correct as to write ; and I published because I was told I might please such as it was a credit to please . To what degree I have done this , I am really ignorant ; I had too much fondness for my productions to judge of them at first , and too much judgment to be pleased with them at last . But I have reason to think they can have no reputation which will continue long , or which deserves to do so : for they have always fallen short , not only of what I read of others , but even of my own ideas of poetry .</p>
   <p>If any one should imagine I am not in earnest , I desire him to reflect that the ancients ( to say the least of them ) had as much genius as we : and that to take more pains , and employ more time , cannot fail to produce more complete pieces . They constantly applied themselves not only to that art , but to that single branch of an art , to which their talent was most powerfully bent ; and it was the business of their lives to correct and finish their works for posterity . If we can pretend to have used the same industry , let us expect the same immortality : though if we took the same care , we should still lie under a further misfortune : they writ in languages that became universal and everlasting , while ours are extremely limited both in extent and in duration . A mighty foundation for our pride ! when the utmost we can hope is but to be read in one island , and to be thrown aside at the end of one age .</p>
   <p>All that is left us is to recommend our productions by the imitation of the ancients ; and it will be found true , that , in every age , the highest character for sense and learning has been obtained by those who have been most indebted to them . For , to say truth , whatever is very good sense must have been common sense in all times ; and what we call learning is but the knowledge of the sense of our predecessors . Therefore they who say our thoughts are not our own , because they resemble the ancients , may as well say our faces are not our own , because they are like our fathers : and indeed it is very unreasonable that people should expect us to be scholars , and yet be angry to find us so .</p>
   <p>I fairly confess that I have served myself all I could by reading ; that I made use of the judgment of authors dead and living ; that I omitted no means in my power to be informed of my errors , both by my friends and enemies : but the true reason these pieces are not more correct , is owing to the consideration how short a time they and I have to live : one may be ashamed to consume half one 's days in bringing sense and rhyme together ; and what critic can be so unreasonable as not to leave a man time enough for any more serious employment , or more agreeable amusement ?</p>
   <p>The only plea I shall use for the favour of the public is , that I have as great a respect for it as most authors have for themselves ; and that I have sacrificed much of my own self-love for its sake , in preventing not only many mean things from seeing the light , but many which I thought tolerable . I would not be like those authors who forgive themselves some particular lines for the sake of a whole poem , and vice versa a whole poem for the sake of some particular lines . I believe no one qualification is so likely to make a good writer as the power of rejecting his own thoughts ; and it must be this ( if anything ) that can give me a chance to be one . For what I have published , I can only hope to be pardoned ; but for what I have burned , I deserve to be praised . On this account the world is under some obligation to me , and owes me the justice in return to look upon no verses as mine that are not inserted in this collection . And perhaps nothing could make it worth my while to own what are really so , but to avoid the imputation of so many dull and immoral things as , partly by malice , and partly by ignorance , have been ascribed to me . I must further acquit myself of the presumption of having lent my name to recommend any miscellanies or works of other men ; a thing I never thought becoming a person who has hardly credit enough to answer for his own .</p>
   <p>In this office of collecting my pieces , I am altogether uncertain whether to look upon myself as a man building a monument , or burying the dead . If time shall make it the former , may these poems ( as long as they last ) remain as a testimony that their author never made his talents subservient to the mean and unworthy ends of party or self-interest ; the gratification of public prejudices or private passions ; the flattery of the undeserving or the insult of the unfortunate . If I have written well , let it be considered that ‘ tis what no man can do without good sense ,— a quality that not only renders one capable of being a good writer , but a good man . And if I have made any acquisition in the opinion of any one under the notion of the former , let it be continued to me under no other title than that of the latter .</p>
   <p>But if this publication be only a more solemn funeral of my remains , I desire it may be known that I die in charity and in my senses , without any murmurs against the justice of this age , or any mad appeals to posterity . I declare I shall think the world in the right , and quietly submit to every truth which time shall discover to the prejudice of these writings ; not so much as wishing so irrational a thing , as that every body should be deceived merely for my credit . However , I desire it may then be considered that there are very few things in this collection which were not written under the age of five-and-twenty : so that my youth may be made ( as it never fails to be in executions ) a case of compassion . That I was never so concerned about my works as to vindicate them in print ; believing , if any thing was good , it would defend itself , and what was bad could never be defended . That I used no artifice to raise or continue a reputation , depreciated no dead author I was obliged to , bribed no living one with unjust praise , insulted no adversary with ill language : or , when I could not attack a rival 's works , encouraged reports against his morals . To conclude , if this volume perish , let it serve as a warning to the critics , not to take too much pains for the future to destroy such things as will die of themselves ; and a memento mori to some of my vain cotemporaries the poets , to teach them that , when real merit is wanting , it avails nothing to have been encouraged by the great , commended by the eminent , and favoured by the public in general .</p>

   <p>VARIATIONS IN THE AUTHOR 'S MANUSCRIPT PREFACE .</p>
   <p>After the words ‘ severely remarked on , ’ p. 2 , l. 41 , it followed thus — For my part , I confess , had I seen things in this view at first , the public had never been troubled either with my writings , or with this apology for them . I am sensible how difficult it is to speak of one 's self with decency : but when a man must speak of himself , the best way is to speak truth of himself , or , he may depend upon it , others will do it for him . I 'll therefore make this preface a general confession of all my thoughts of my own poetry , resolving with the same freedom to expose myself , as it is in the power of any other to expose them . In the first place , I thank God and nature that I was born with a love to poetry ; for nothing more conduces to fill up all the intervals of our time , or , if rightly used , to make the whole course of life entertaining : Cantantes licet usque ( minus via laedet ) . ‘ Tis a vast happiness to possess the pleasures of the head , the only pleasures in which a man is sufficient to himself , and the only part of him which , to his satisfaction , he can employ all day long . The Muses are amicae omnium horarum ; and , like our gay acquaintance , the best company in the world as long as one expects no real service from them . I confess there was a time when I was in love with myself , and my first productions were the children of Self-Love upon Innocence . I had made an epic poem , and panegyrics on all the princes in Europe , and thought myself the greatest genius that ever was . I can n't but regret those delightful visions of my childhood , which , like the fine colours we see when our eyes are shut , are vanished for ever . Many trials and sad experience have so undeceived me by degrees , that I am utterly at a loss at what rate to value myself . As for fame , I shall be glad of any I can get , and not repine at any I miss ; and as for vanity , I have enough to keep me from hanging myself , or even from wishing those hanged who would take it away . It was this that made me write . The sense of my faults made me correct .</p>
   <p>After the words ‘ angry to find us so , ’ p. 3 , l. 36 , occurred the following — In the first place I own that I have used my best endeavours to the finishing these pieces . That I made what advantage I could of the judgment of authors dead and living ; and that I omitted no means in my power to be informed of my errors by my friends and by my enemies . And that I expect no favour on account of my youth , business , want of health , or any such idle excuses . But the true reason they are not yet more correct is owing to the consideration how short a time they and I have to live . A man that can expect but sixty years may be ashamed to employ thirty in measuring syllables and bringing sense and rhyme together . To spend our youth in pursuit of riches or fame , in hopes to enjoy them when we are old ; and when we are old , we find it is too late to enjoy any thing . I therefore hope the wits will pardon me , if I reserve some of my time to save my soul ; and that some wise men will be of my opinion , even if I should think a part of it better spent in the enjoyments of life than in pleasing the critics .</p>

   <p>VIRG .</p>
   <p>There are not , I believe , a greater number of any sort of verses than of those which are called Pastorals ; nor a smaller , than of those which are truly so . It therefore seems necessary to give some account of this kind of poem ; and it is my design to comprise in this short paper the substance of those numerous dissertations the critics have made on the subject , without omitting any of their rules in my own favour . You will also find some points reconciled , about which they seem to differ , and a few remarks which , I think , have escaped their observation .</p>
   <p>The original of poetry is ascribed to that age which succeeded the creation of the world : and as the keeping of flocks seems to have been the first employment of mankind , the most ancient sort of poetry was probably pastoral . It is natural to imagine , that the leisure of those ancient shepherds admitting and inviting some diversion , none was so proper to that solitary and sedentary life as singing ; and that in their songs they took occasion to celebrate their own felicity . From hence a poem was invented , and afterwards improved to a perfect image of that happy time ; which , by giving us an esteem for the virtues of a former age , might recommend them to the present . And since the life of shepherds was attended with more tranquility than any other rural employment , the poets chose to introduce their persons , from whom it received the name of “ pastoral . ”</p>
   <p>A pastoral is an imitation of the action of a shepherd , or one considered under that character . The form of this imitation is dramatic , or narrative , or mixed of both ; the fable simple , the manners not too polite nor too rustic : the thoughts are plain , yet admit a little quickness and passion , but that short and flowing : the expression humble , yet as pure as the language will afford ; neat , but not florid ; easy and yet lively . In short , the fable , manners , thoughts , and expressions are full of the greatest simplicity in nature .</p>
   <p>The complete character of this poem consists in simplicity , brevity , and delicacy ; the two first of which render an eclogue natural , and the last delightful .</p>
   <p>If we would copy nature , it may be useful to take this idea along with us , that pastoral is an image of what they call the Golden Age . So that we are not to describe our shepherds as shepherds at this day really are , but as they may be conceived then to have been , when the best of men followed the employment . To carry this resemblance yet further , it would not be amiss to give these shepherds some skill in astronomy , as far as it may be useful to that sort of life . And an air of piety to the gods should shine through the poem , which so visibly appears in all the works of antiquity : and it ought to preserve some relish of the old way of writing ; the connexion should be loose , the narrations and descriptions short , and the periods concise . Yet it is not sufficient , that the sentences only be brief , the whole eclogue should be so too . For we cannot suppose poetry in those days to have been the business of men , but their recreation at vacant hours .</p>
   <p>But with respect to the present age , nothing more conduces to make these composures natural than when some knowledge in rural affairs is discovered . This may be made to appear rather done by chance than on design , and sometimes is best shown by inference ; lest by too much study to seem natural , we destroy that easy simplicity from whence arises the delight . For what is inviting in this sort of poetry , proceeds not so much from the idea of that business , as of the tranquility of a country life .</p>
   <p>We must therefore use some illusion to render a pastoral delightful ; and this consists in exposing the best side only of a shepherd 's life , and in concealing its miseries . Nor is it enough to introduce shepherds discoursing together in a natural way ; but a regard must be had to the subject — that it contain some particular beauty in itself , and that it be different in every eclogue . Besides , in each of them a designed scene or prospect is to be presented to our view , which should likewise have its variety . This variety is obtained in a great degree by frequent comparisons , drawn from the most agreeable objects of the country ; by interrogations to things inanimate ; by beautiful digressions , but those short ; sometimes by insisting a little on circumstances ; and lastly , by elegant turns on the words , which render the numbers extremely sweet and pleasing . As for the numbers themselves , though they are properly of the heroic measure , they should be the smoothest , the most easy and flowing imaginable .</p>
   <p>It is by rules like these that we ought to judge of pastorals . And since the instructions given for any art are to be delivered as that art is in perfection , they must of necessity be derived from those in whom it is acknowledged so to be . It is therefore from the practice of Theocritus and Virgil ( the only undisputed authors of pastoral ) that the critics have drawn the foregoing notions concerning it .</p>
   <p>Theocritus excels all others in nature and simplicity . The subjects of his ‘ Idyllia ’ are purely pastoral ; but he is not so exact in his persons , having introduced reapers and fishermen as well as shepherds . He is apt to be too long in his descriptions , of which that of the cup in the first pastoral is a remarkable instance . In the manners he seems a little defective , for his swains are sometimes abusive and immodest , and perhaps too much inclining to rusticity ; for instance , in his fourth and fifth ‘ Idyllia . ’ But ‘ tis enough that all others learnt their excellencies from him , and that his dialect alone has a secret charm in it , which no other could ever attain .</p>
   <p>Virgil , who copies Theocritus , refines upon his original : and in all points where judgment is principally concerned , he is much superior to his master .</p>
   <p>Though some of his subjects are not pastoral in themselves , but only seem to be such , they have a wonderful variety in them , which the Greek was a stranger to . He exceeds him in regularity and brevity , and falls short of him in nothing but simplicity and propriety of style ; the first of which perhaps was the fault of his age , and the last of his language .</p>
   <p>Among the moderns , their success has been greatest who have most endeavoured to make these ancients their pattern . The most considerable genius appears in the famous Tasso , and our Spenser . Tasso in his ‘ Aminta ’ has as far excelled all the pastoral writers , as in his ‘ Gierusalemme ’ he has outdone the epic poets of his country . But as this piece seems to have been the original of a new sort of poem — the pastoral comedy — in Italy , it cannot so well be considered as a copy of the ancients . Spenser 's Calendar , in Mr Dryden 's opinion , is the most complete work of this kind which any nation has produced ever since the time of Virgil . Not but that he may be thought imperfect in some few points . His Eclogues are somewhat too long , if we compare them with the ancients . He is sometimes too allegorical , and treats of matters of religion in a pastoral style , as the Mantuan had done before him . He has employed the lyric measure , which is contrary to the practice of the old poets . His stanza is not still the same , nor always well chosen . This last may be the reason his expression is sometimes not concise enough : for the Tetrastic has obliged him to extend his sense to the length of four lines , which would have been more closely confined in the couplet .</p>
   <p>In the manners , thoughts , and characters , he comes near to Theocritus himself ; though , notwithstanding all the care he has taken , he is certainly inferior in his dialect : for the Doric had its beauty and propriety in the time of Theocritus ; it was used in part of Greece , and frequent in the mouths of many of the greatest persons : whereas the old English and country phrases of Spenser were either entirely obsolete , or spoken only by people of the lowest condition . As there is a difference betwixt simplicity and rusticity , so the expression of simple thoughts should be plain , but not clownish . The addition he has made of a Calendar to his Eclogues , is very beautiful ; since by this , besides the general moral of innocence and simplicity , which is common to other authors of pastoral , he has one peculiar to himself — he compares human life to the several seasons , and at once exposes to his readers a view of the great and little worlds , in their various changes and aspects . Yet the scrupulous division of his pastorals into months has obliged him either to repeat the same description , in other words , for three months together ; or , when it was exhausted before , entirely to omit it : whence it comes to pass that some of his Eclogues ( as the sixth , eighth , and tenth , for example ) have nothing but their titles to distinguish them . The reason is evident — because the year has not that variety in it to furnish every month with a particular description , as it may every season .</p>
   <p>Of the following eclogues I shall only say , that these four comprehend all the subjects which the critics upon Theocritus and Virgil will allow to be fit for pastoral : that they have as much variety of description , in respect of the several seasons , as Spenser 's : that , in order to add to this variety , the several times of the day are observed , the rural employments in each season or time of day , and the rural scenes or places proper to such employments ; not without some regard to the several ages of man , and the different passions proper to each age .</p>
   <p>But after all , if they have any merit , it is to be attributed to some good old authors , whose works as I had leisure to study , so I hope I have not wanted care to imitate .</p>

    <head>MESSIAH .</head>
    <head>A SACRED ECLOGUE , IN IMITATION OF VIRGIL 'S ‘ POLLIO . ’</head>
    <head>ADVERTISEMENT .</head>
    <head>In reading several passages of the Prophet Isaiah , which foretell the coming of Christ and the felicities attending it , I could not but observe a remarkable parity between many of the thoughts , and those in the ‘ Pollio ’ of Virgil . This will not seem surprising , when we reflect , that the eclogue was taken from a Sibylline prophecy on the same subject . One may judge that Virgil did not copy it line by line , but selected such ideas as best agreed with the nature of pastoral poetry , and disposed them in that manner which served most to beautify his piece . I have endeavoured the same in this imitation of him , though without admitting anything of my own ; since it was written with this particular view , that the reader , by comparing the several thoughts , might see how far the images and descriptions of the prophet are superior to those of the poet . But as I fear I have prejudiced them by my management , I shall subjoin the passages of Isaiah and those of Virgil , under the same disadvantage of a literal translation .</head>

      <l n="4">To tire our patience , than mislead our sense .</l>
      <l n="5">Some few in that , but numbers err in this ;</l>
      <l n="6">Ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss ;</l>
      <l n="7">A fool might once himself alone expose ,</l>

    <head>THE RAPE OF THE LOCK :</head>
    <head>AN HEROI-COMICAL POEM .</head>
    <head>WRITTEN IN THE YEAR MDCCXII .</head>
     <l n="1">‘ Nolueram , Belinda , tuos violare capillos ;</l>
     <l n="2">Sed juvat , hoc precibus me tribuisse tuis . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>MART .</p>
   <p>TO MRS ARABELLA FERMOR .</p>
   <p>Madam ,— It will be in vain to deny that I have some regard for this piece , since I dedicate it to you . Yet you may bear me witness , it was intended only to divert a few young ladies , who have good sense and good-humour enough to laugh not only at their sex 's little unguarded follies , but at their own . But as it was communicated with the air of a secret , it soon found its way into the world . An imperfect copy having been offered to a bookseller , you had the good-nature for my sake to consent to the publication of one more correct : this I was forced to , before I had executed half my design , for the machinery was entirely wanting to complete it .</p>
   <p>The machinery , Madam , is a term invented by the critics , to signify that part which the deities , angels , or demons are made to act in a poem : for the ancient poets are in one respect like many modern ladies : let an action be never so trivial in itself , they always make it appear of the utmost importance . These machines I determined to raise on a very new and odd foundation — the Rosicrucian doctrine of spirits .</p>
   <p>I know how disagreeable it is to make use of hard words before a lady ; but ‘ tis so much the concern of a poet to have his works understood , and particularly by your sex , that you must give me leave to explain two or three difficult terms .</p>
   <p>The Rosicrucians are a people I must bring you acquainted with . The best account I know of them is in a French book called ‘ Le Comte de Gabalis , ’ which both in its title and size is so like a novel , that many of the fair sex have read it for one by mistake . According to these gentlemen , the four elements are inhabited by spirits , which they call Sylphs , Gnomes , Nymphs , and Salamanders . The Gnomes , or Demons of Earth , delight in mischief ; but the Sylphs , whose habitation is in the air , are the best-conditioned creatures imaginable . For they say , any mortals may enjoy the most intimate familiarities with these gentle spirits , upon a condition very easy to all true adepts — an inviolate preservation of chastity .</p>
   <p>As to the following cantos , all the passages of them are as fabulous as the vision at the beginning , or the transformation at the end ; ( except the loss of your hair , which I always mention with reverence ) . The human persons are as fictitious as the airy ones ; and the character of Belinda , as it is now managed , resembles you in nothing but in beauty .</p>
   <p>If this poem had as many graces as there are in your person , or in your mind , yet I could never hope it should pass through the world half so uncensured as you have done . But let its fortune be what it will , mine is happy enough to have given me this occasion of assuring you that I am , with the truest esteem , Madam , your most obedient , humble servant ,</p>

    <head>THE TEMPLE OF FAME .</head>
    <head>WRITTEN IN THE YEAR MDCCXI .</head>
    <head>ADVERTISEMENT .</head>
    <head>The hint of the following piece was taken from Chaucer 's ‘ House of Fame . ’ The design is in a manner entirely altered , the descriptions and most of the particular thoughts my own : yet I could not suffer it to be printed without this acknowledgment . The reader who would compare this with Chaucer , may begin with his third book of ‘ Fame , ’ there being nothing in the two first books that answers to their title . Wherever any hint is taken from him , the passage itself is set down in the marginal notes .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In that soft season , when descending showers</l>
     <l n="2">Call forth the greens , and wake the rising flowers ;</l>
     <l n="3">When opening buds salute the welcome day ,</l>
     <l n="4">And earth relenting feels the genial ray ;</l>
     <l n="5">As balmy sleep had charm 'd my cares to rest ,</l>
     <l n="6">And love itself was banish 'd from my breast ,</l>
     <l n="7">( What time the morn mysterious visions brings ,</l>
     <l n="8">While purer slumbers spread their golden wings ) ,</l>
     <l n="9">A train of phantoms in wild order rose ,</l>
     <l n="10">And , join 'd , this intellectual scene compose . 10</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">I stood , methought , betwixt earth , seas , and skies ;</l>
     <l n="12">The whole creation open to my eyes :</l>
     <l n="13">In air self-balanced hung the globe below ,</l>
     <l n="14">Where mountains rise and circling oceans flow ;</l>
     <l n="15">Here naked rocks , and empty wastes were seen ,</l>
     <l n="16">There towery cities , and the forests green :</l>
     <l n="17">Here sailing ships delight the wandering eyes :</l>
     <l n="18">There trees , and intermingled temples rise ;</l>
     <l n="19">Now a clear sun the shining scene displays ,</l>
     <l n="20">The transient landscape now in clouds decays . 20</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="21">O'er the wide prospect , as I gazed around ,</l>
     <l n="22">Sudden I heard a wild promiscuous sound ,</l>
     <l n="23">Like broken thunders that at distance roar ,</l>
     <l n="24">Or billows murmuring on the hollow shore :</l>
     <l n="25">Then gazing up , a glorious pile beheld ,</l>
     <l n="26">Whose towering summit ambient clouds conceal 'd .</l>
     <l n="27">High on a rock of ice the structure lay ,</l>
     <l n="28">Steep its ascent , and slippery was the way ;</l>
     <l n="29">The wondrous rock like Parian marble shone ,</l>
     <l n="30">And seem 'd , to distant sight , of solid stone . 30</l>
     <l n="31">Inscriptions here of various names I view 'd ,</l>
     <l n="32">The greater part by hostile time subdued ;</l>
     <l n="33">Yet wide was spread their fame in ages past ,</l>
     <l n="34">And poets once had promised they should last .</l>
     <l n="35">Some fresh engraved appear 'd of wits renown 'd ;</l>
     <l n="36">I look 'd again , nor could their trace be found .</l>
     <l n="37">Critics I saw , that other names deface ,</l>
     <l n="38">And fix their own , with labour , in their place :</l>
     <l n="39">Their own , like others , soon their place resign 'd ,</l>
     <l n="40">Or disappear 'd , and left the first behind . 40</l>
     <l n="41">Nor was the work impair 'd by storms alone ,</l>
     <l n="42">But felt the approaches of too warm a sun ;</l>
     <l n="43">For Fame , impatient of extremes , decays</l>
     <l n="44">Not more by envy than excess of praise .</l>
     <l n="45">Yet part no injuries of heaven could feel ,</l>
     <l n="46">Like crystal faithful to the graving steel :</l>
     <l n="47">The rock 's high summit , in the temple 's shade ,</l>
     <l n="48">Nor heat could melt , nor beating storm invade .</l>
     <l n="49">Their names inscribed unnumber 'd ages past</l>
     <l n="50">From time 's first birth , with time itself shall last ; 50</l>
     <l n="51">These ever new , nor subject to decays ,</l>
     <l n="52">Spread , and grow brighter with the length of days .</l>

    <head>ELOISA TO ABELARD .</head>
    <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>Abelard and Eloisa flourished in the twelfth century ; they were two of the most distinguished persons of their age in learning and beauty , but for nothing more famous than for their unfortunate passion . After a long course of calamities , they retired each to a several convent , and consecrated the remainder of their days to religion . It was many years after this separation that a letter of Abelard 's to a friend , which contained the history of his misfortune , fell into the hands of Eloisa . This , awakening all her tenderness , occasioned those celebrated letters ( out of which the following is partly extracted ) which give so lively a picture of the struggles of grace and nature , virtue and passion .</head>

     <l n="1">In these deep solitudes and awful cells ,</l>
     <l n="2">Where heavenly-pensive Contemplation dwells ,</l>
     <l n="3">And ever-musing Melancholy reigns ,</l>
     <l n="4">What means this tumult in a vestal 's veins ?</l>
     <l n="5">Why rove my thoughts beyond this last retreat ?</l>
     <l n="6">Why feels my heart its long-forgotten heat ?</l>
     <l n="7">Yet , yet I love !— From Abelard it came ,</l>
     <l n="8">And Eloisa yet must kiss the name .</l>

     <l n="9">Dear fatal name ! rest ever unreveal 'd ,</l>
     <l n="10">Nor pass these lips in holy silence seal 'd : 10</l>
     <l n="11">Hide it , my heart , within that close disguise</l>
     <l n="12">Where , mix 'd with God 's , his loved idea lies :</l>
     <l n="13">Oh write it not , my hand !— the name appears</l>
     <l n="14">Already written — wash it out , my tears !</l>
     <l n="15">In vain lost Eloisa weeps and prays ,</l>

     <l n="38">Lost in a convent 's solitary gloom !</l>

     <l n="56">Excuse the blush , and pour out all the heart ,</l>

   <p>AN ESSAY ON MAN :</p>
   <p>IN FOUR EPISTLES TO HENRY ST JOHN , LORD BOLINGBROKE .</p>
   <p>THE DESIGN .</p>
   <p>Having proposed to write some pieces on human life and manners , such as ( to use my Lord Bacon 's expression ) come home to men 's business and bosoms , I thought it more satisfactory to begin with considering man in the abstract , his nature and his state ; since , to prove any moral duty , to enforce any moral precept , or to examine the perfection or imperfection of any creature whatsoever , it is necessary first to know what condition and relation it is placed in , and what is the proper end and purpose of its being .</p>
   <p>The science of human nature is , like all other sciences , reduced to a few clear points : there are not many certain truths in this world . It is therefore in the anatomy of the mind as in that of the body ; more good will accrue to mankind by attending to the large , open , and perceptible parts , than by studying too much such finer nerves and vessels , the conformations and uses of which will for ever escape our observation . The disputes are all upon these last , and , I will venture to say , they have less sharpened the wits than the hearts of men against each other , and have diminished the practice , more than advanced the theory , of morality . If I could flatter myself that this essay has any merit , it is in steering betwixt the extremes of doctrines seemingly opposite , in passing over terms utterly unintelligible , and in forming a temperate yet not inconsistent , and a short yet not imperfect system of ethics .</p>
   <p>This I might have done in prose ; but I chose verse , and even rhyme , for two reasons . The one will appear obvious ; that principles , maxims , or precepts so written , both strike the reader more strongly at first , and are more easily retained by him afterwards : the other may seem odd , but is true ; I found I could express them more shortly this way than in prose itself ; and nothing is more certain , than that much of the force as well as grace of arguments or instructions , depends on their conciseness . I was unable to treat this part of my subject more in detail , without becoming dry and tedious ; or more poetically , without sacrificing perspicuity to ornament , without wandering from the precision , or breaking the chain of reasoning : If any man can unite all these without diminution of any of them , I freely confess he will compass a thing above my capacity .</p>
   <p>What is now published , is only to be considered as a general map of Man , marking out no more than the greater parts , their extent , their limits , and their connexion , but leaving the particular to be more fully delineated in the charts which are to follow . Consequently , these epistles in their progress ( if I have health and leisure to make any progress ) will be less dry , and more susceptible of poetical ornament . I am here only opening the fountains , and clearing the passage . To deduce the rivers , to follow them in their course , and to observe their effects , may be a task more agreeable .</p>
   <p>EPISTLE I .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>ARGUMENT</head>
    <head>OF THE NATURE AND STATE OF MAN WITH RESPECT TO THE UNIVERSE .</head>
     <l n="1">Of man in the abstract .—</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I . That we can judge only with regard to our own system , being ignorant of the relations of systems and things , ver . 17 , &amp; c. II . That Man is not to be deemed imperfect , but a being suited to his place and rank in the creation , agreeable to the general order of things , and conformable to ends and relations to him unknown , ver . 35 , &amp; c. III . That it is partly upon his ignorance of future events , and partly upon the hope of a future state , that all his happiness in the present depends , ver . 77 , &amp; c. IV . The pride of aiming at more knowledge , and pretending to more perfection , the cause of Man 's error and misery . The impiety of putting himself in the place of God , and judging of the fitness or unfitness , perfection or imperfection , justice or injustice of his dispensations , ver . 109 , &amp; c. V. The absurdity of conceiting himself the final cause of the creation , or expecting that perfection in the moral world , which is not in the natural , ver . 131 , &amp; c. VI . The unreasonableness of his complaints against Providence , while on the one hand he demands the perfections of the angels , and on the other the bodily qualifications of the brutes ; though to possess any of the sensitive faculties in a higher degree , would render him miserable , ver . 173 , &amp; c. VII . That throughout the whole visible world , an universal order and gradation in the sensual and mental faculties is observed , which causes a subordination of creature to creature , and of all creatures to Man . The gradations of sense , instinct , thought , reflection , reason ; that reason alone countervails all the other faculties , ver . 207 . VIII . How much further this order and subordination of living creatures may extend , above and below us ; were any part of which broken , not that part only , but the whole connected creation must be destroyed , ver . 233 . IX . The extravagance , madness , and pride of such a desire , ver . 259 . X . The consequence of all , the absolute submission due to Providence , both as to our present and future state , ver . 281 , &amp; c. to the end .</p>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>OF THE NATURE AND STATE OF MAN WITH RESPECT TO HAPPINESS .</head>
    <head>I . False notions of happiness , philosophical and popular , answered from ver . 19 to ver . 27 . II . It is the end of all men , and attainable by all , ver . 29 . God intends happiness to be equal ; and to be so , it must be social , since all particular happiness depends on general , and since he governs by general , not particular laws , ver . 35 . As it is necessary for order , and the peace and welfare of society , that external goods should be unequal , happiness is not made to consist in these , ver . 51 . But , notwithstanding that inequality , the balance of happiness among mankind is kept even by Providence , by the two passions of hope and fear , ver . 70 . III . What the happiness of individuals is , as far as is consistent with the constitution of this world ; and that the good man has here the advantage , ver . 77 . The error of imputing to virtue what are only the calamities of nature , or of fortune , ver . 94 . IV . The folly of expecting that God should alter his general laws in favour of particulars , ver . 121 . V. That we are not judges who are good ; but that , whoever they are , they must be happiest , ver . 131 , &amp; c. VI . That external goods are not the proper rewards , but often inconsistent with , or destructive of virtue , ver . 167 . That even these can make no man happy without virtue : instanced in riches ver . 185 ; honours , ver . 193 ; nobility , ver . 205 ; greatness , ver . 217 ; fame , ver . 237 ; superior talents , ver . 259 , &amp; c. With pictures of human infelicity in men possessed of them all , ver . 269 , &amp; c. VII . That virtue only constitutes a happiness , whose object is universal , and whose prospect eternal , ver . 309 , &amp; c. That the perfection of virtue and happiness consists in a conformity to the order of Providence here , and a resignation to it here and hereafter , ver . 326 , &amp; c .</head>

   <p>EPISTLE TO DR ARBUTHNOT ;</p>
   <p>OR , PROLOGUE TO THE SATIRES .</p>
   <p>ADVERTISEMENT .</p>
   <p>This paper is a sort of bill of complaint , begun many years since , and drawn up by snatches , as the several occasions offered . I had no thoughts of publishing it , till it pleased some persons of rank and fortune ( the authors of ‘ Verses to the Imitator of Horace , ’ and of an ‘ Epistle to a Doctor of Divinity from a Nobleman at Hampton Court ’ ) to attack , in a very extraordinary manner , not only my writings ( of which , being public , the public is judge ) but my person , morals , and family , whereof , to those who know me not , a truer information may be requisite . Being divided between the necessity to say something of myself , and my own laziness to undertake so awkward a task , I thought it the shortest way to put the last hand to this epistle . If it have anything pleasing , it will be that by which I am most desirous to please , the truth and the sentiment ; and if anything offensive , it will be only to those I am least sorry to offend , the vicious or the ungenerous .</p>
   <p>Many will know their own pictures in it , there being not a circumstance but what is true ; but I have , for the most part , spared their names , and they may escape being laughed at , if they please .</p>
   <p>I would have some of them know , it was owing to the request of the learned and candid friend to whom it is inscribed , that I make not as free use of theirs as they have done of mine . However , I shall have this advantage and honour on my side , that whereas , by their proceeding , any abuse may be directed at any man , no injury can possibly be done by mine , since a nameless character can never be found out , but by its truth and likeness .</p>

    <head>SATIRES AND EPISTLES OF HORACE IMITATED .</head>
    <head>ADVERTISEMENT .</head>
    <head>The occasion of publishing these ‘ Imitations ’ was the clamour raised on some of my ‘ Epistles . ’ An answer from Horace was both more full , and of more dignity , than any I could have made in my own person ; and the example of much greater freedom in so eminent a divine as Dr Donne , seemed a proof with what indignation and contempt a Christian may treat vice or folly , in ever so low or ever so high a station . Both these authors were acceptable to the princes and ministers under whom they lived . The satires of Dr Donne I versified , at the desire of the Earl of Oxford while he was Lord Treasurer , and of the Duke of Shrewsbury who had been Secretary of State ; neither of whom looked upon a satire on vicious courts as any reflection on those they served in . And , indeed , there is not in the world a greater error than that which fools are so apt to fall into , and knaves with good reason to encourage , the mistaking a satirist for a libeller ; whereas to a true satirist nothing is so odious as a libeller , for the same reason as to a man truly virtuous nothing is so hateful as a hypocrite .</head>

   <p>THE FIRST EPISTLE OF THE SECOND BOOK OF HORACE .</p>
   <p>ADVERTISEMENT .</p>
   <p>The reflections of Horace , and the judgments past in his Epistle to Augustus , seemed so seasonable to the present times , that I could not help applying them to the use of my own country . The author thought them considerable enough to address them to his prince ; whom he paints with all the great and good qualities of a monarch , upon whom the Romans depended for the increase of an absolute empire . But to make the poem entirely English , I was willing to add one or two of those which contribute to the happiness of a free people , and are more consistent with the welfare of our neighbours .</p>
   <p>This epistle will show the learned world to have fallen into two mistakes : One , that Augustus was a patron of poets in general ; whereas he not only prohibited all but the best writers to name him , but recommended that care even to the civil magistrate : Admonebat praetores , ne paterentur nomen suum obsolefieri , &amp; c. The other , that this piece was only a general discourse of poetry ; whereas it was an apology for the poets , in order to render Augustus more their patron . Horace here pleads the cause of his contemporaries , first against the taste of the town , whose humour it was to magnify the authors of the preceding age ; secondly against the court and nobility , who encouraged only the writers for the theatre ; and lastly against the emperor himself , who had conceived them of little use to the government . He shows ( by a view of the progress of learning , and the change of taste among the Romans ) that the introduction of the polite arts of Greece had given the writers of his time great advantages over their predecessors ; that their morals were much improved , and the license of those ancient poets restrained ; that satire and comedy were become more just and useful ; that whatever extravagances were left on the stage , were owing to the ill taste of the nobility ; that poets , under due regulations , were in many respects useful to the state ; and concludes , that it was upon them the emperor himself must depend for his fame with posterity .</p>
   <p>We may further learn from this epistle , that Horace made his court to this great prince by writing with a decent freedom toward him , with a just contempt of his low flatterers , and with a manly regard to his own character .</p>

     <l n="4">Secure of peace at least beyond the grave .</l>
     <l n="5">I 've had my purgatory here betimes ,</l>

     <l n="9">With foolish pride my heart was never fired ,</l>
     <l n="10">Nor the vain itch t ’ admire , or be admired ; 10</l>

     <l n="12">I bought no benefice , I begg 'd no place ;</l>

The author sent it to the lady , with whom he was acquainted ; and she took it so well as to give about copies of it . That first sketch ( we learn from one of his letters ) was written in less than a fortnight , in 1711 , in two cantos only , and it was so printed ; first , in a miscellany of Ben . Lintot 's , without the name of the author . But it was received so well that he enlarged it the next year by the addition of the machinery of the Sylphs , and extended it to five cantos .</p>
