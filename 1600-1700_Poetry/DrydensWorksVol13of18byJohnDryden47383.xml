   </lg>
   <p>MY LORD ,</p>
   <p>The wishes and desires of all good men , which have attended your lordship from your first appearance in the world , are at length accomplished , from your obtaining those honours and dignities which you have so long deserved . There are no factions , though irreconcileable to one another , that are not united in their affection to you , and the respect they pay you . They are equally pleased in your prosperity , and would be equally concerned in your afflictions . Titus Vespasian was not more the delight of human kind . The universal empire made him only more known , and more powerful , but could not make him more beloved . He had greater ability of doing good , but your inclination to it is not less ; and though you could not extend your beneficence to so many persons , yet you have lost as few days as that excellent emperor ; and never had his complaint to make when you went to bed , that the sun had shone upon you in vain , when you had the opportunity of relieving some unhappy man . This , my lord , has justly acquired you as many friends as there are persons who have the honour to be known to you . Mere acquaintance you have none ; you have drawn them all into a nearer line ; and they who have conversed with you are for ever after inviolably yours . This is a truth so generally acknowledged , that it needs no proof : it is of the nature of a first principle , which is received as soon as it is proposed ; and needs not the reformation which Descartes used to his ; for we doubt not , neither can we properly say , we think we admire and love you above all other men ; there is a certainty in the proposition , and we know it . With the same assurance I can say , you neither have enemies , nor can scarce have any ; for they who have never heard of you , can neither love or hate you ; and they who have , can have no other notion of you , than that which they receive from the public , that you are the best of men . After this , my testimony can be of no farther use , than to declare it to be day-light at high-noon ; and all who have the benefit of sight , can look up as well , and see the sun .</p>
   <p>It is true , I have one privilege which is almost particular to myself , that I saw you in the east at your first arising above the hemisphere : I was as soon sensible as any man of that light , when it was but just shooting out , and beginning to travel upwards to the meridian . I made my early addresses to your lordship , in my “ Essay of Dramatic Poetry ; ” and therein bespoke you to the world , wherein I have the right of a first discoverer .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>When I was myself in the rudiments of my poetry , without name or reputation in the world , having rather the ambition of a writer , than the skill ; when I was drawing the outlines of an art , without any living master to instruct me in it ; an art which had been better praised than studied here in England , wherein Shakespeare , who created the stage among us , had rather written happily , than knowingly and justly , and Jonson , who , by studying Horace , had been acquainted with the rules , yet seemed to envy to posterity that knowledge , and , like an inventor of some useful art , to make a monopoly of his learning ; when thus , as I may say , before the use of the load-stone , or knowledge of the compass , I was sailing in a vast ocean , without other help than the pole-star of the ancients , and the rules of the French stage amongst the moderns , which are extremely different from ours , by reason of their opposite taste ; yet even then , I had the presumption to dedicate to your lordship — a very unfinished piece , I must confess , and which only can be excused by the little experience of the author , and the modesty of the title — “ An Essay . ” Yet I was stronger in prophecy than I was in criticism ; I was inspired to foretell you to mankind , as the restorer of poetry , the greatest genius , the truest judge , and the best patron .</p>
   <p>Good sense and good nature are never separated , though the ignorant world has thought otherwise . Good nature , by which I mean beneficence and candour , is the product of right reason ; which of necessity will give allowance to the failings of others , by considering that there is nothing perfect in mankind ; and by distinguishing that which comes nearest to excellency , though not absolutely free from faults , will certainly produce a candour in the judge . It is incident to an elevated understanding , like your lordship 's , to find out the errors of other men ; but it is your prerogative to pardon them ; to look with pleasure on those things , which are somewhat congenial , and of a remote kindred to your own conceptions ; and to forgive the many failings of those , who , with their wretched art , cannot arrive to those heights that you possess , from a happy , abundant , and native genius : which are as inborn to you , as they were to Shakespeare ; and , for aught I know , to Homer ; in either of whom we find all arts and sciences , all moral and natural philosophy , without knowing that they ever studied them .</p>
   <p>There is not an English writer this day living , who is not perfectly convinced , that your lordship excels all others in all the several parts of poetry which you have undertaken to adorn . The most vain , and the most ambitious of our age , have not dared to assume so much , as the competitors of Themistocles : they have yielded the first place without dispute ; and have been arrogantly content to be esteemed as second to your lordship ; and even that also , with a longo , sed proximi intervallo . If there have been , or are any , who go farther in their self-conceit , they must be very singular in their opinion ; they must be like the officer in a play , who was called Captain , Lieutenant , and Company . The world will easily conclude , whether such unattended generals can ever be capable of making a revolution in Parnassus .</p>
   <p>I will not attempt , in this place , to say any thing particular of your Lyric Poems , though they are the delight and wonder of this age , and will be the envy of the next .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>The subject of this book confines me to satire ; and in that , an author of your own quality , ( whose ashes I will not disturb ,) has given you all the commendation which his self-sufficiency could afford to any man : “ The best good man , with the worst-natured muse . "[ 4 ] In that character , methinks , I am reading Jonson 's verses to the memory of Shakespeare ; an insolent , sparing , and invidious panegyric : where good nature , the most godlike commendation of a man , is only attributed to your person , and denied to your writings ; for they are every where so full of candour , that , like Horace , you only expose the follies of men , without arraigning their vices ; and in this excel him , that you add that pointedness of thought , which is visibly wanting in our great Roman . There is more of salt in all your verses , than I have seen in any of the moderns , or even of the ancients ; but you have been sparing of the gall , by which means you have pleased all readers , and offended none . Donne alone , of all our countrymen , had your talent ; but was not happy enough to arrive at your versification ; and were he translated into numbers , and English , he would yet be wanting in the dignity of expression . That which is the prime virtue , and chief ornament , of Virgil , which distinguishes him from the rest of writers , is so conspicuous in your verses , that it casts a shadow on all your contemporaries ; we cannot be seen , or but obscurely , while you are present . You equal Donne in the variety , multiplicity , and choice of thoughts ; you excel him in the manner and the words . I read you both with the same admiration , but not with the same delight . He affects the metaphysics , not only in his satires , but in his amorous verses , where nature only should reign ; and perplexes the minds of the fair sex with nice speculations of philosophy , when he should engage their hearts , and entertain them with the softnesses of love . In this ( if I may be pardoned for so bold a truth ) Mr Cowley has copied him to a fault ; so great a one , in my opinion , that it throws his Mistress infinitely below his Pindarics , and his latter compositions , which are undoubtedly the best of his poems , and the most correct . For my own part , I must avow it freely to the world , that I never attempted any thing in satire , wherein I have not studied your writings as the most perfect model . I have continually laid them before me ; and the greatest commendation , which my own partiality can give to my productions , is , that they are copies , and no farther to be allowed , than as they have something more or less of the original . Some few touches of your lordship , some secret graces which I have endeavoured to express after your manner , have made whole poems of mine to pass with approbation ; but take your verses altogether , and they are inimitable . If therefore I have not written better , it is because you have not written more . You have not set me sufficient copy to transcribe ; and I cannot add one letter of my own invention , of which I have not the example there .</p>
   <p>It is a general complaint against your lordship , and I must have leave to upbraid you with it , that , because you need not write , you will not . Mankind , that wishes you so well in all things that relate to your prosperity , have their intervals of wishing for themselves , and are within a little of grudging you the fulness of your fortune : they would be more malicious if you used it not so well , and with so much generosity .</p>
   <p>Fame is in itself a real good , if we may believe Cicero , who was perhaps too fond of it ; but even fame , as Virgil tells us , acquires strength by going forward . Let Epicurus give indolency as an attribute to his gods , and place in it the happiness of the blest ; the divinity which we worship has given us not only a precept against it , but his own example to the contrary . The world , my lord , would be content to allow you a seventh day for rest ; or if you thought that hard upon you , we would not refuse you half your time : if you came out , like some great monarch , to take a town but once a year , as it were for your diversion , though you had no need to extend your territories . In short , if you were a bad , or , which is worse , an indifferent poet , we would thank you for our own quiet , and not expose you to the want of yours . But when you are so great and so successful , and when we have that necessity of your writing , that we cannot subsist entirely without it , any more ( I may almost say ) than the world without the daily course of ordinary providence , methinks this argument might prevail with you , my lord , to forego a little of your repose for the public benefit . It is not that you are under any force of working daily miracles , to prove your being ; but now and then somewhat of extraordinary , that is , any thing of your production , is requisite to refresh your character .</p>
   <p>This , I think , my lord , is a sufficient reproach to you ; and should I carry it as far as mankind would authorise me , would be little less than satire . And , indeed , a provocation is almost necessary , in behalf of the world , that you might be induced sometimes to write ; and in relation to a multitude of scribblers , who daily pester the world with their insufferable stuff , that they might be discouraged from writing any more . I complain not of their lampoons and libels , though I have been the public mark for many years . I am vindictive enough to have repelled force by force , if I could imagine that any of them had ever reached me ; but they either shot at rovers ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>and therefore missed , or their powder was so weak , that I might safely stand them , at the nearest distance . I answered not the “ Rehearsal , ” because I knew the author sat to himself when he drew the picture , and was the very Bayes of his own farce : because also I knew , that my betters<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>were more concerned than I was in that satire : and , lastly , because Mr Smith and Mr Johnson , the main pillars of it , were two such languishing gentlemen in their conversation , that I could liken them to nothing but to their own relations , those noble characters of men of wit and pleasure about the town . The like considerations have hindered me from dealing with the lamentable companions of their prose and doggrel . I am so far from defending my poetry against them , that I will not so much as expose theirs . And for my morals , if they are not proof against their attacks , let me be thought by posterity , what those authors would be thought , if any memory of them , or of their writings , could endure so long as to another age . But these dull makers of lampoons , as harmless as they have been to me , are yet of dangerous example to the public . Some witty men may perhaps succeed to their designs , and , mixing sense with malice , blast the reputation of the most innocent amongst men , and the most virtuous amongst women .</p>
   <p>Heaven be praised , our common libellers are as free from the imputation of wit as of morality ; and therefore whatever mischief they have designed , they have performed but little of it . Yet these ill writers , in all justice , ought themselves to be exposed ; as Persius has given us a fair example in his first satire , which is levelled particularly at them ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>and none is so fit to correct their faults , as he who is not only clear from any in his own writings , but is also so just , that he will never defame the good ; and is armed with the power of verse , to punish and make examples of the bad . But of this I shall have occasion to speak further , when I come to give the definition and character of true satires .</p>
   <p>In the mean time , as a counsellor bred up in the knowledge of the municipal and statute laws , may honestly inform a just prince how far his prerogative extends ; so I may be allowed to tell your lordship , who , by an undisputed title , are the king of poets , what an extent of power you have , and how lawfully you may exercise it , over the petulant scribblers of this age . As lord chamberlain , I know , you are absolute by your office , in all that belongs to the decency and good manners of the stage . You can banish from thence scurrility and profaneness , and restrain the licentious insolence of poets , and their actors , in all things that shock the public quiet , or the reputation of private persons , under the notion of humour . But I mean not the authority , which is annexed to your office ; I speak of that only which is inborn and inherent to your person ; what is produced in you by an excellent wit , a masterly and commanding genius over all writers : whereby you are empowered , when you please , to give the final decision of wit ; to put your stamp on all that ought to pass for current ; and set a brand of reprobation on clipped poetry , and false coin . A shilling dipped in the Bath may go for gold amongst the ignorant , but the sceptres on the guineas show the difference .<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>That your lordship is formed by nature for this supremacy , I could easily prove , ( were it not already granted by the world ,) from the distinguishing character of your writing : which is so visible to me , that I never could be imposed on to receive for yours , what was written by any others ; or to mistake your genuine poetry for their spurious productions . I can farther add , with truth , ( though not without some vanity in saying it ,) that in the same paper , written by divers hands , whereof your lordship 's was only part , I could separate your gold from their copper ; and though I could not give back to every author his own brass , ( for there is not the same rule for distinguishing betwixt bad and bad , as betwixt ill and excellently good ,) yet I never failed of knowing what was yours , and what was not ; and was absolutely certain , that this , or the other part , was positively yours , and could not possibly be written by any other .</p>
   <p>True it is , that some bad poems , though not all , carry their owners ’ marks about them . There is some peculiar awkwardness , false grammar , imperfect sense , or , at the least , obscurity ; some brand or other on this buttock , or that ear , that it is notorious who are the owners of the cattle , though they should not sign it with their names . But your lordship , on the contrary , is distinguished , not only by the excellency of your thoughts , but by your style and manner of expressing them . A painter , judging of some admirable piece , may affirm , with certainty , that it was of Holbein , or Vandyck ; but vulgar designs , and common draughts , are easily mistaken , and misapplied . Thus , by my long study of your lordship , I am arrived at the knowledge of your particular manner . In the good poems of other men , like those artists , I can only say , this is like the draught of such a one , or like the colouring of another . In short , I can only be sure , that it is the hand of a good master ; but in your performances , it is scarcely possible for me to be deceived . If you write in your strength , you stand revealed at the first view ; and should you write under it , you cannot avoid some peculiar graces , which only cost me a second consideration to discover you : for I may say it , with all the severity of truth , that every line of yours is precious . Your lordship 's only fault is , that you have not written more ; unless I could add another , and that yet greater , but I fear for the public the accusation would not be true ,— that you have written , and out of a vicious modesty will not publish .</p>
   <p>Virgil has confined his works within the compass of eighteen thousand lines , and has not treated many subjects ; yet he ever had , and ever will have , the reputation of the best poet . Martial says of him , that he could have excelled Varius in tragedy , and Horace in lyric poetry , but out of deference to his friends , he attempted neither .<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span></p>
   <p>The same prevalence of genius is in your lordship , but the world cannot pardon your concealing it on the same consideration ; because we have neither a living Varius , nor a Horace , in whose excellencies , both of poems , odes , and satires , you had equalled them , if our language had not yielded to the Roman majesty , and length of time had not added a reverence to the works of Horace . For good sense is the same in all or most ages ; and course of time rather improves nature , than impairs her . What has been , may be again : another Homer , and another Virgil , may possibly arise from those very causes which produced the first ; though it would be impudence to affirm , that any such have yet appeared .</p>
   <p>It is manifest , that some particular ages have been more happy than others in the production of great men , in all sorts of arts and sciences ; as that of Euripides , Sophocles , Aristophanes , and the rest , for stage poetry amongst the Greeks ; that of Augustus , for heroic , lyric , dramatic , elegiac , and indeed all sorts of poetry , in the persons of Virgil , Horace , Varius , Ovid , and many others ; especially if we take into that century the latter end of the commonwealth , wherein we find Varo , Lucretius , and Catullus ; and at the same time lived Cicero , and Sallust , and Cæsar . A famous age in modern times , for learning in every kind , was that of Lorenzo de Medici , and his son Leo the Tenth ; wherein painting was revived , and poetry flourished , and the Greek language was restored .</p>
   <p>Examples in all these are obvious : but what I would infer is this ; that in such an age , it is possible some great genius may arise , to equal any of the ancients ; abating only for the language . For great contemporaries whet and cultivate each other ; and mutual borrowing , and commerce , makes the common riches of learning , as it does of the civil government .</p>
   <p>But suppose that Homer and Virgil were the only of their species , and that nature was so much worn out in producing them , that she is never able to bear the like again , yet the example only holds in heroic poetry : in tragedy and satire , I offer myself to maintain against some of our modern critics , that this age and the last , particularly in England , have excelled the ancients in both those kinds ; and I would instance in Shakespeare of the former , of your lordship in the latter sort .<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span></p>
   <p>Thus I might safely confine myself to my native country ; but if I would only cross the seas , I might find in France a living Horace and a Juvenal , in the person of the admirable Boileau ; whose numbers are excellent , whose expressions are noble , whose thoughts are just , whose language is pure , whose satire is pointed , and whose sense is close ; what he borrows from the ancients , he repays with usury of his own , in coin as good , and almost as universally valuable : for , setting prejudice and partiality apart , though he is our enemy , the stamp of a Louis , the patron of all arts , is not much inferior to the medal of an Augustus Cæsar . Let this be said without entering into the interests of factions and parties , and relating only to the bounty of that king to men of learning and merit ; a praise so just , that even we , who are his enemies , cannot refuse it to him .</p>
   <p>Now if it may be permitted me to go back again to the consideration of epic poetry , I have confessed , that no man hitherto has reached , or so much as approached , to the excellencies of Homer , or of Virgil ; I must farther add , that Statius , the best versificator next to Virgil , knew not how to design after him , though he had the model in his eye ; that Lucan is wanting both in design and subject , and is besides too full of heat and affectation ; that amongst the moderns , Ariosto neither designed justly , nor observed any unity of action , or compass of time , or moderation in the vastness of his draught : his style is luxurious , without majesty or decency , and his adventures without the compass of nature and possibility . Tasso , whose design was regular , and who observed the rules of unity in time and place more closely than Virgil , yet was not so happy in his action ; he confesses himself to have been too lyrical , that is , to have written beneath the dignity of heroic verse , in his Episodes of Sophronia , Erminia , and Armida . His story is not so pleasing as Ariosto 's ; he is too flatulent sometimes , and sometimes too dry ; many times unequal , and almost always forced ; and , besides , is full of conceipts , points of epigram , and witticisms ; all which are not only below the dignity of heroic verse , but contrary to its nature : Virgil and Homer have not one of them . And those who are guilty of so boyish an ambition in so grave a subject , are so far from being considered as heroic poets , that they ought to be turned down from Homer to the Anthologia , from Virgil to Martial and Owen 's Epigrams , and from Spenser to Flecno ; that is , from the top to the bottom of all poetry . But to return to Tasso : he borrows from the invention of Boiardo , and in his alteration of his poem , which is infinitely for the worse , imitates Homer so very servilely , that ( for example ) he gives the king of Jerusalem fifty sons , only because Homer had bestowed the like number on king Priam ; he kills the youngest in the same manner , and has provided his hero with a Patroclus , under another name , only to bring him back to the wars , when his friend was killed .<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>The French have performed nothing in this kind which is not far below those two Italians , and subject to a thousand more reflections , without examining their St Lewis , their Pucelle , or their Alarique .<span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span>The English have only to boast of Spenser and Milton , who neither of them wanted either genius or learning to have been perfect poets , and yet both of them are liable to many censures . For there is no uniformity in the design of Spenser : he aims at the accomplishment of no one action ; he raises up a hero for every one of his adventures ; and endows each of them with some particular moral virtue , which renders them all equal , without subordination , or preference . Every one is most valiant in his own legend : only we must do him that justice to observe , that magnanimity , which is the character of Prince Arthur , shines throughout the whole poem ; and succours the rest , when they are in distress . The original of every knight was then living in the court of Queen Elizabeth ; and he attributed to each of them that virtue , which he thought was most conspicuous in them ; an ingenious piece of flattery , though it turned not much to his account . Had he lived to finish his poem , in the six remaining legends , it had certainly been more of a piece ; but could not have been perfect , because the model was not true . But Prince Arthur , or his chief patron Sir Philip Sydney , whom he intended to make happy by the marriage of his Gloriana , dying before him , deprived the poet both of means and spirit to accomplish his design .<span type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span>For the rest , his obsolete language ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 14 ]</span>and the ill choice of his stanza , are faults but of the second magnitude ; for , notwithstanding the first , he is still intelligible , at least after a little practice ; and for the last , he is the more to be admired , that , labouring under such a difficulty , his verses are so numerous , so various , and so harmonious , that only Virgil , whom he professedly imitated , has surpassed him among the Romans ; and only Mr Waller among the English .</p>
   <p>As for Mr Milton , whom we all admire with so much justice , his subject is not that of an heroic poem , properly so called . His design is the losing of our happiness ; his event is not prosperous , like that of all other epic works ; his heavenly machines are many , and his human persons are but two . But I will not take Mr Rymer 's work out of his hands : he has promised the world a critique on that author ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 15 ]</span>wherein , though he will not allow his poem for heroic , I hope he will grant us , that his thoughts are elevated , his words sounding , and that no man has so happily copied the manner of Homer , or so copiously translated his Grecisms , and the Latin elegancies of Virgil . It is true , he runs into a flat of thought , sometimes for a hundred lines together , but it is when he has got into a track of scripture . His antiquated words were his choice , not his necessity ; for therein he imitated Spenser , as Spenser did Chaucer . And though , perhaps , the love of their masters may have transported both too far , in the frequent use of them , yet , in my opinion , obsolete words may then be laudably revived , when either they are more sounding , or more significant , than those in practice ; and when their obscurity is taken away , by joining other words to them , which clear the sense ; according to the rule of Horace , for the admission of new words .<span type="note_anchor">[ 16 ]</span>But in both cases a moderation is to be observed in the use of them : for unnecessary coinage , as well as unnecessary revival , runs into affectation ; a fault to be avoided on either hand . Neither will I justify Milton for his blank verse , though I may excuse him , by the example of Hannibal Caro , and other Italians , who have used it ; for whatever causes he alleges for the abolishing of rhyme , ( which I have not now the leisure to examine ,) his own particular reason is plainly this , that rhyme was not his talent ; he had neither the ease of doing it , nor the graces of it ; which is manifest in his “ Juvenilia , ” or verses written in his youth , where his rhyme is always constrained and forced , and comes hardly from him , at an age when the soul is most pliant , and the passion of love makes almost every man a rhymer , though not a poet .</p>
   <p>By this time , my lord , I doubt not but that you wonder , why I have run off from my bias so long together , and made so tedious a digression from satire to heroic poetry . But if you will not excuse it , by the tattling quality of age , which , as Sir William D'Avenant says , is always narrative , yet I hope the usefulness of what I have to say on this subject will qualify the remoteness of it ; and this is the last time I will commit the crime of prefaces , or trouble the world with my notions of any thing that relates to verse .<span type="note_anchor">[ 17 ]</span>I have then , as you see , observed the failings of many great wits amongst the moderns , who have attempted to write an epic poem . Besides these , or the like animadversions of them by other men , there is yet a farther reason given , why they cannot possibly succeed so well as the ancients , even though we could allow them not to be inferior , either in genius or learning , or the tongue in which they write , or all those other wonderful qualifications which are necessary to the forming of a true accomplished heroic poet . The fault is laid on our religion ; they say , that Christianity is not capable of those embellishments which are afforded in the belief of those ancient heathens .</p>
   <p>And it is true , that , in the severe notions of our faith , the fortitude of a Christian consists in patience , and suffering , for the love of God , whatever hardships can befall in the world ; not in any great attempts , or in performance of those enterprizes which the poets call heroic , and which are commonly the effects of interest , ostentation , pride , and worldly honour : that humility and resignation are our prime virtues ; and that these include no action , but that of the soul ; when as , on the contrary , an heroic poem requires to its necessary design , and as its last perfection , some great action of war , the accomplishment of some extraordinary undertaking ; which requires the strength and vigour of the body , the duty of a soldier , the capacity and prudence of a general , and , in short , as much , or more , of the active virtue , than the suffering . But to this the answer is very obvious . God has placed us in our several stations ; the virtues of a private Christian are patience , obedience , submission , and the like ; but those of a magistrate , or general , or a king , are prudence , counsel , active fortitude , coercive power , awful command , and the exercise of magnanimity , as well as justice . So that this objection hinders not , but that an epic poem , or the heroic action of some great commander , enterprized for the common good , and honour of the Christian cause , and executed happily , may be as well written now , as it was of old by the heathens ; provided the poet be endued with the same talents ; and the language , though not of equal dignity , yet as near approaching to it , as our modern barbarism will allow ; which is all that can be expected from our own , or any other now extant , though more refined ; and therefore we are to rest contented with that only inferiority , which is not possibly to be remedied .</p>
   <p>I wish I could as easily remove that other difficulty which yet remains . It is objected by a great French critic , as well as an admirable poet , yet living , and whom I have mentioned with that honour which his merit exacts from me , I mean Boileau , that the machines of our Christian religion , in heroic poetry , are much more feeble to support that weight than those of heathenism . Their doctrine , grounded as it was on ridiculous fables , was yet the belief of the two victorious monarchies , the Grecian and Roman . Their gods did not only interest themselves in the event of wars , ( which is the effect of a superior providence ,) but also espoused the several parties , in a visible corporeal descent , managed their intrigues , and fought their battles sometimes in opposition to each other : though Virgil ( more discreet than Homer in that last particular ) has contented himself with the partiality of his deities , their favours , their counsels or commands , to those whose cause they had espoused , without bringing them to the outrageousness of blows . Now , our religion ( says he ) is deprived of the greatest part of those machines ; at least the most shining in epic poetry . Though St Michael , in Ariosto , seeks out Discord , to send her among the Pagans , and finds her in a convent of friars , where peace should reign , which indeed is fine satire ; and Satan , in Tasso , excites Solyman to an attempt by night on the Christian camp , and brings an host of devils to his assistance ; yet the archangel , in the former example , when Discord was restive , and would not be drawn from her beloved monastery with fair words , has the whip-hand of her , drags her out with many stripes , sets her , on God 's name , about her business , and makes her know the difference of strength betwixt a nuncio of heaven , and a minister of hell . The same angel , in the latter instance from Tasso , ( as if God had never another messenger belonging to the court , but was confined like Jupiter to Mercury , and Juno to Iris ,) when he sees his time , that is , when half of the Christians are already killed , and all the rest are in a fair way to be routed , stickles betwixt the remainders of God 's host , and the race of fiends ; pulls the devils backward by the tails , and drives them from their quarry ; or otherwise the whole business had miscarried , and Jerusalem remained untaken . This , says Boileau , is a very unequal match for the poor devils , who are sure to come by the worst of it in the combat ; for nothing is more easy , than for an Almighty Power to bring his old rebels to reason , when he pleases . Consequently , what pleasure , what entertainment , can be raised from so pitiful a machine , where we see the success of the battle from the very beginning of it ; unless that , as we are Christians , we are glad that we have gotten God on our side , to maul our enemies , when we cannot do the work ourselves ? For , if the poet had given the faithful more courage , which had cost him nothing , or at least have made them exceed the Turks in number , he might have gained the victory for us Christians , without interesting heaven in the quarrel , and that with as much ease , and as little credit to the conqueror , as when a party of a hundred soldiers defeats another which consists only of fifty .</p>
   <p>This , my lord , I confess , is such an argument against our modern poetry , as cannot be answered by those mediums which have been used . We cannot hitherto boast , that our religion has furnished us with any such machines , as have made the strength and beauty of the ancient buildings .</p>
   <p>But what if I venture to advance an invention of my own , to supply the manifest defect of our new writers ? I am sufficiently sensible of my weakness ; and it is not very probable that I should succeed in such a project , whereof I have not had the least hint from any of my predecessors , the poets , or any of their seconds and coadjutors , the critics . Yet we see the art of war is improved in sieges , and new instruments of death are invented daily ; something new in philosophy , and the mechanics , is discovered almost every year ; and the science of former ages is improved by the succeeding . I will not detain you with a long preamble to that , which better judges will , perhaps , conclude to be little worth .</p>
   <p>It is this , in short — that Christian poets have not hitherto been acquainted with their own strength . If they had searched the Old Testament as they ought , they might there have found the machines which are proper for their work ; and those more certain in their effect , than it may be the New Testament is , in the rules sufficient for salvation . The perusing of one chapter in the prophecy of Daniel , and accommodating what there they find with the principles of Platonic philosophy , as it is now christianized , would have made the ministry of angels as strong an engine , for the working up heroic poetry , in our religion , as that of the ancients has been to raise theirs by all the fables of their gods , which were only received for truths by the most ignorant and weakest of the people .<span type="note_anchor">[ 18 ]</span></p>
   <p>It is a doctrine almost universally received by Christians , as well Protestants as Catholics , that there are guardian angels , appointed by God Almighty , as his vicegerents , for the protection and government of cities , provinces , kingdoms , and monarchies ; and those as well of heathens , as of true believers . All this is so plainly proved from those texts of Daniel , that it admits of no farther controversy . The prince of the Persians , and that other of the Grecians , are granted to be the guardians and protecting ministers of those empires . It cannot be denied , that they were opposite , and resisted one another . St Michael is mentioned by his name as the patron of the Jews ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 19 ]</span>and is now taken by the Christians , as the protector-general of our religion . These tutelar genii , who presided over the several people and regions committed to their charge , were watchful over them for good , as far as their commissions could possibly extend . The general purpose , and design of all , was certainly the service of their Great Creator . But it is an undoubted truth , that , for ends best known to the Almighty Majesty of heaven , his providential designs for the benefit of his creatures , for the debasing and punishing of some nations , and the exaltation and temporal reward of others , were not wholly known to these his ministers ; else why those factious quarrels , controversies , and battles amongst themselves , when they were all united in the same design , the service and honour of their common master ? But being instructed only in the general , and zealous of the main design ; and , as finite beings , not admitted into the secrets of government , the last resorts of providence , or capable of discovering the final purposes of God , who can work good out of evil as he pleases , and irresistibly sways all manner of events on earth , directing them finally for the best , to his creation in general , and to the ultimate end of his own glory in particular ; they must , of necessity , be sometimes ignorant of the means conducing to those ends , in which alone they can jar and oppose each other . One angel , as we may suppose — the Prince of Persia , as he is called , judging , that it would be more for God 's honour , and the benefit of his people , that the Median and Persian monarchy , which delivered them from the Babylonish captivity , should still be uppermost ; and the patron of the Grecians , to whom the will of God might be more particularly revealed , contending , on the other side , for the rise of Alexander and his successors , who were appointed to punish the backsliding Jews , and thereby to put them in mind of their offences , that they might repent , and become more virtuous , and more observant of the law revealed . But how far these controversies , and appearing enmities , of those glorious creatures may be carried ; how these oppositions may be best managed , and by what means conducted , is not my business to show or determine ; these things must be left to the invention and judgement of the poet : if any of so happy a genius be now living , or any future age can produce a man , who , being conversant in the philosophy of Plato , as it is now accommodated to Christian use , ( for , as Virgil gives us to understand by his example , that is the only proper , of all others , for an epic poem ,) who , to his natural endowments , of a large invention , a ripe judgment , and a strong memory , has joined the knowledge of the liberal arts and sciences , and particularly moral philosophy , the mathematics , geography , and history , and with all these qualifications is born a poet ; knows , and can practise the variety of numbers , and is master of the language in which he writes ;— if such a man , I say , be now arisen , or shall arise , I am vain enough to think , that I have proposed a model to him , by which he may build a nobler , a more beautiful , and more perfect poem , than any yet extant since the ancients .</p>
   <p>There is another part of these machines yet wanting ; but , by what I have said , it would have been easily supplied by a judicious writer . He could not have failed to add the opposition of ill spirits to the good ; they have also their design , ever opposite to that of heaven ; and this alone has hitherto been the practice of the moderns : but this imperfect system , if I may call it such , which I have given , will infinitely advance and carry farther that hypothesis of the evil spirits contending with the good . For , being so much weaker , since their fall , than those blessed beings , they are yet supposed to have a permitted power from God of acting ill , as , from their own depraved nature , they have always the will of designing it . A great testimony of which we find in holy writ , when God Almighty suffered Satan to appear in the holy synod of the angels , ( a thing not hitherto drawn into example by any of the poets ,) and also gave him power over all things belonging to his servant Job , excepting only life .</p>
   <p>Now , what these wicked spirits cannot compass , by the vast disproportion of their forces to those of the superior beings , they may , by their fraud and cunning , carry farther , in a seeming league , confederacy , or subserviency to the designs of some good angel , as far as consists with his purity to suffer such an aid , the end of which may possibly be disguised , and concealed from his finite knowledge . This is , indeed , to suppose a great error in such a being : yet since a devil can appear like an angel of light ; since craft and malice may sometimes blind , for a while , a more perfect understanding ; and , lastly , since Milton has given us an example of the like nature , when Satan , appearing like a cherub to Uriel , the intelligence of the sun , circumvented him even in his own province , and passed only for a curious traveller through those new-created regions , that he might observe therein the workmanship of God , and praise him in his works ,— I know not why , upon the same supposition , or some other , a fiend may not deceive a creature of more excellency than himself , but yet a creature ; at least , by the connivance , or tacit permission , of the Omniscient Being .</p>
   <p>Thus , my lord , I have , as briefly as I could , given your lordship , and by you the world , a rude draught of what I have been long labouring in my imagination , and what I had intended to have put in practice , ( though far unable for the attempt of such a poem ,) and to have left the stage , ( to which my genius never much inclined me ,) for a work which would have taken up my life in the performance of it . This , too , I had intended chiefly for the honour of my native country , to which a poet is particularly obliged . Of two subjects , both relating to it , I was doubtful whether I should choose that of King Arthur conquering the Saxons , which , being farther distant in time , gives the greater scope to my invention ; or that of Edward , the Black Prince , in subduing Spain , and restoring it to the lawful prince , though a great tyrant , Don Pedro the Cruel : which , for the compass of time , including only the expedition of one year ; for the greatness of the action , and its answerable event ; for the magnanimity of the English hero , opposed to the ingratitude of the person whom he restored ; and for the many beautiful episodes , which I had interwoven with the principal design , together with the characters of the chiefest English persons ; ( wherein , after Virgil and Spenser , I would have taken occasion to represent my living friends and patrons of the noblest families , and also shadowed the events of future ages , in the succession of our imperial line ,) — with these helps , and those of the machines , which I have mentioned , I might perhaps have done as well as some of my predecessors , or at least chalked out a way for others to amend my errors in a like design ; but being encouraged only with fair words by King Charles II ., my little salary ill paid , and no prospect of a future subsistence , I was then discouraged in the beginning of my attempt ; and now age has overtaken me , and want , a more insufferable evil , through the change of the times , has wholly disenabled me . Though I must ever acknowledge , to the honour of your lordship , and the eternal memory of your charity , that , since this revolution , wherein I have patiently suffered the ruin of my small fortune , and the loss of that poor subsistence which I had from two kings , whom I had served more faithfully than profitably to myself ,— then your lordship was pleased , out of no other motive but your own nobleness , without any desert of mine , or the least solicitation from me , to make me a most bountiful present , which , at that time , when I was most in want of it , came most seasonably and unexpectedly to my relief . That favour , my lord , is of itself sufficient to bind any grateful man to a perpetual acknowledgment , and to all the future service , which one of my mean condition can ever be able to perform . May the Almighty God return it for me , both in blessing you here , and rewarding you hereafter ! I must not presume to defend the cause for which I now suffer , because your lordship is engaged against it ; but the more you are so , the greater is my obligation to you , for your laying aside all the considerations of factions and parties , to do an action of pure disinterested charity . This is one amongst many of your shining qualities , which distinguish you from others of your rank . But let me add a farther truth , that , without these ties of gratitude , and abstracting from them all , I have a most particular inclination to honour you ; and , if it were not too bold an expression , to say , I love you . It is no shame to be a poet , though it is to be a bad one . Augustus Cæsar of old , and Cardinal Richlieu of late , would willingly have been such ; and David and Solomon were such . You who , without flattery , are the best of the present age in England , and would have been so , had you been born in any other country , will receive more honour in future ages , by that one excellency , than by all those honours to which your birth has entitled you , or your merits have acquired you .</p>

   <p>I have formerly said in this epistle , that I could distinguish your writings from those of any others ; it is now time to clear myself from any imputation of self-conceit on that subject . I assume not to myself any particular lights in this discovery ; they are such only as are obvious to every man of sense and judgment , who loves poetry , and understands it . Your thoughts are always so remote from the common way of thinking , that they are , as I may say , of another species , than the conceptions of other poets ; yet you go not out of nature for any of them . Gold is never bred upon the surface of the ground , but lies so hidden , and so deep , that the mines of it are seldom found ; but the force of waters casts it out from the bowels of mountains , and exposes it amongst the sands of rivers ; giving us of her bounty , what we could not hope for by our search . This success attends your lordship 's thoughts , which would look like chance , if it were not perpetual , and always of the same tenor . If I grant that there is care in it , it is such a care as would be ineffectual and fruitless in other men . It is the curiosa felicitas which Petronius ascribes to Horace in his Odes . We have not wherewithal to imagine so strongly , so justly , and so pleasantly ; in short , if we have the same knowledge , we cannot draw out of it the same quintessence ; we cannot give it such a turn , such a propriety , and such a beauty ; something is deficient in the manner , or the words , but more in the nobleness of our conception . Yet when you have finished all , and it appears in its full lustre , when the diamond is not only found , but the roughness smoothed , when it is cut into a form , and set in gold , then we cannot but acknowledge , that it is the perfect work of art and nature ; and every one will be so vain , to think he himself could have performed the like , until he attempts it . It is just the description that Horace makes of such a finished piece : it appears so easy ,</p>

   <p>And , besides all this , it is your lordship 's particular talent to lay your thoughts so close together , that , were they closer , they would be crowded , and even a due connection would be wanting . We are not kept in expectation of two good lines , which are to come after a long parenthesis of twenty bad ; which is the April poetry of other writers , a mixture of rain and sunshine by fits : you are always bright , even almost to a fault , by reason of the excess . There is continual abundance , a magazine of thought , and yet a perpetual variety of entertainment ; which creates such an appetite in your reader , that he is not cloyed with any thing , but satisfied with all . It is that which the Romans call , cæna dubia ; where there is such plenty , yet withal so much diversity , and so good order , that the choice is difficult betwixt one excellency and another ; and yet the conclusion , by a due climax , is evermore the best ; that is , as a conclusion ought to be , ever the most proper for its place . See , my lord , whether I have not studied your lordship with some application ; and , since you are so modest that you will not be judge and party , I appeal to the whole world , if I have not drawn your picture to a great degree of likeness , though it is but in miniature , and that some of the best features are yet wanting . Yet what I have done is enough to distinguish you from any other , which is the proposition that I took upon me to demonstrate .</p>
   <p>And now , my lord , to apply what I have said to my present business . The Satires of Juvenal and Persius appearing in this new English dress , cannot so properly be inscribed to any man as to your lordship , who are the first of the age in that way of writing . Your lordship , amongst many other favours , has given me your permission for this address ; and you have particularly encouraged me by your perusal and approbation of the Sixth and Tenth Satires of Juvenal , as I have translated them . My fellow-labourers have likewise commissioned me , to perform , in their behalf , this office of a dedication to you ; and will acknowledge , with all possible respect and gratitude , your acceptance of their work . Some of them have the honour to be known to your lordship already ; and they who have not yet that happiness , desire it now . Be pleased to receive our common endeavours with your wonted candour , without entitling you to the protection of our common failings in so difficult an undertaking . And allow me your patience , if it be not already tired with this long epistle , to give you , from the best authors , the origin , the antiquity , the growth , the change , and the completement of satire among the Romans ; to describe , if not define , the nature of that poem , with its several qualifications and virtues , together with the several sorts of it ; to compare the excellencies of Horace , Persius , and Juvenal , and show the particular manners of their satires ; and , lastly , to give an account of this new way of version , which is attempted in our performance : all which , according to the weakness of my ability , and the best lights which I can get from others , shall be the subject of my following discourse .</p>
   <p>The most perfect work of poetry , says our master Aristotle , is tragedy . His reason is , because it is the most united ; being more severely confined within the rules of action , time , and place . The action is entire , of a piece , and one , without episodes ; the time limited to a natural day ; and the place circumscribed at least within the compass of one town , or city . Being exactly proportioned thus , and uniform in all its parts , the mind is more capable of comprehending the whole beauty of it without distraction .</p>
   <p>But , after all these advantages , an heroic poem is certainly the greatest work of human nature . The beauties and perfections of the other are but mechanical ; those of the epic are more noble : though Homer has limited his place to Troy , and the fields about it ; his actions to forty-eight natural days , whereof twelve are holidays , or cessation from business , during the funeral of Patroclus .— To proceed ; the action of the epic is greater ; the extention of time enlarges the pleasure of the reader , and the episodes give it more ornament , and more variety . The instruction is equal ; but the first is only instructive , the latter forms a hero , and a prince .</p>
   <p>If it signifies any thing which of them is of the more ancient family , the best and most absolute heroic poem was written by Homer long before tragedy was invented . But if we consider the natural endowments , and acquired parts , which are necessary to make an accomplished writer in either kind , tragedy requires a less and more confined knowledge ; moderate learning , and observation of the rules , is sufficient , if a genius be not wanting . But in an epic poet , one who is worthy of that name , besides an universal genius , is required universal learning , together with all those qualities and acquisitions which I have named above , and as many more as I have , through haste or negligence , omitted . And , after all , he must have exactly studied Homer and Virgil , as his patterns ; Aristotle and Horace , as his guides ; and Vida and Bossu , as their commentators ; with many others , both Italian and French critics , which I want leisure here to recommend .</p>
   <p>In a word , what I have to say in relation to this subject , which does not particularly concern satire , is , that the greatness of an heroic poem , beyond that of a tragedy , may easily be discovered , by observing how few have attempted that work in comparison to those who have written dramas ; and , of those few , how small a number have succeeded . But leaving the critics , on either side , to contend about the preference due to this or that sort of poetry , I will hasten to my present business , which is the antiquity and origin of satire , according to those informations which I have received from the learned Casaubon , Heinsius , Rigaltius , Dacier , and the Dauphin 's Juvenal ; to which I shall add some observations of my own .</p>
   <p>There has been a long dispute among the modern critics , whether the Romans derived their satire from the Grecians , or first invented it themselves . Julius Scaliger , and Heinsius , are of the first opinion ; Casaubon , Rigaltius , Dacier , and the publisher of the Dauphin 's Juvenal , maintain the latter . If we take satire in the general signification of the word , as it is used in all modern languages , for an invective , it is certain that it is almost as old as verse ; and though hymns , which are praises of God , may be allowed to have been before it , yet the defamation of others was not long after it . After God had cursed Adam and Eve in Paradise , the husband and wife excused themselves , by laying the blame on one another ; and gave a beginning to those conjugal dialogues in prose , which the poets have perfected in verse . The third chapter of Job is one of the first instances of this poem in holy scripture ; unless we will take it higher , from the latter end of the second , where his wife advises him to curse his Maker .</p>
   <p>This original , I confess , is not much to the honour of satire ; but here it was nature , and that depraved : when it became an art , it bore better fruit . Only we have learnt thus much already , that scoffs and revilings are of the growth of all nations : and , consequently , that neither the Greek poets borrowed from other people their art of railing , neither needed the Romans to take it from them . But , considering satire as a species of poetry , here the war begins amongst the critics . Scaliger , the father , will have it descend from Greece to Rome ; and derives the word satire from Satyrus , that mixed kind of animal , or , as the ancients thought him , rural god , made up betwixt a man and a goat ; with a human head , hooked nose , pouting lips , a bunch , or struma , under the chin , pricked ears , and upright horns ; the body shagged with hair , especially from the waist , and ending in a goat , with the legs and feet of that creature . But Casaubon , and his followers , with reason , condemn this derivation ; and prove , that from Satyrus , the word satira , as it signifies a poem , cannot possibly descend . For satira is not properly a substantive , but an adjective ; to which the word lanx ( in English , a charger , or large platter ) is understood ; so that the Greek poem , made according to the manners of a Satyr , and expressing his qualities , must properly be called satyrical , and not satire . And thus far it is allowed that the Grecians had such poems ; but that they were wholly different in species from that to which the Romans gave the name of satire .</p>
   <p>Aristotle divides all poetry , in relation to the progress of it , into nature without art , art begun , and art completed . Mankind , even the most barbarous , have the seeds of poetry implanted in them . The first specimen of it was certainly shown in the praises of the Deity , and prayers to him ; and as they are of natural obligation , so they are likewise of divine institution : which Milton observing , introduces Adam and Eve every morning adoring God in hymns and prayers . The first poetry was thus begun , in the wild notes of natural poetry , before the invention of feet , and measures . The Grecians and Romans had no other original of their poetry . Festivals and holidays soon succeeded to private worship , and we need not doubt but they were enjoined by the true God to his own people , as they were afterwards imitated by the heathens ; who , by the light of reason , knew they were to invoke some superior Being in their necessities , and to thank him for his benefits . Thus , the Grecian holidays were celebrated with offerings to Bacchus , and Ceres , and other deities , to whose bounty they supposed they were owing for their corn and wine , and other helps of life ; and the ancient Romans , as Horace tells us , paid their thanks to mother Earth , or Vesta , to Silvanus , and their Genius , in the same manner . But as all festivals have a double reason of their institution , the first of religion , the other of recreation , for the unbending of our minds , so both the Grecians and Romans agreed , after their sacrifices were performed , to spend the remainder of the day in sports and merriments ; amongst which , songs and dances , and that which they called wit , ( for want of knowing better ,) were the chiefest entertainments . The Grecians had a notion of Satyrs , whom I have already described ; and taking them , and the Sileni , that is , the young Satyrs and the old , for the tutors , attendants , and humble companions of their Bacchus , habited themselves like those rural deities , and imitated them in their rustic dances , to which they joined songs , with some sort of rude harmony , but without certain numbers ; and to these they added a kind of chorus .</p>
   <p>The Romans , also , ( as nature is the same in all places ,) though they knew nothing of those Grecian demi-gods , nor had any communication with Greece , yet had certain young men , who , at their festivals , danced and sung , after their uncouth manner , to a certain kind of verse , which they called Saturnian . What it was , we have no certain light from antiquity to discover ; but we may conclude , that , like the Grecian , it was void of art , or , at least , with very feeble beginnings of it . Those ancient Romans , at these holidays , which were a mixture of devotion and debauchery , had a custom of reproaching each other with their faults , in a sort of extempore poetry , or rather of tunable hobbling verse ; and they answered in the same kind of gross raillery ; their wit and their music being of a piece . The Grecians , says Casaubon , had formerly done the same , in the persons of their petulant Satyrs . But I am afraid he mistakes the matter , and confounds the singing and dancing of the Satyrs , with the rustical entertainments of the first Romans . The reason of my opinion is this ; that Casaubon , finding little light from antiquity of these beginnings of poetry amongst the Grecians , but only these representations of Satyrs , who carried canisters and cornucopias full of several fruits in their hands , and danced with them at their public feasts ; and afterwards reading Horace , who makes mention of his homely Romans jesting at one another in the same kind of solemnities , might suppose those wanton Satyrs did the same ; and especially because Horace possibly might seem to him , to have shown the original of all poetry in general , including the Grecians as well as Romans ; though it is plainly otherwise , that he only described the beginning , and first rudiments , of poetry in his own country . The verses are these , which he cites from the First Epistle of the Second Book , which was written to Augustus :</p>

   <p>Yet since it is a hard conjecture , that so great a man as Casaubon should misapply what Horace writ concerning ancient Rome , to the ceremonies and manners of ancient Greece , I will not insist on this opinion ; but rather judge in general , that since all poetry had its original from religion , that of the Grecians and Rome had the same beginning . Both were invented at festivals of thanksgiving , and both were prosecuted with mirth and raillery , and rudiments of verses : amongst the Greeks , by those who represented Satyrs ; and amongst the Romans , by real clowns .</p>
   <p>For , indeed , when I am reading Casaubon on these two subjects , methinks I hear the same story told twice over with very little alteration . Of which Dacier taking notice , in his interpretation of the Latin verses which I have translated , says plainly , that the beginning of poetry was the same , with a small variety , in both countries ; and that the mother of it , in all nations , was devotion . But , what is yet more wonderful , that most learned critic takes notice also , in his illustrations on the First Epistle of the Second Book , that as the poetry of the Romans , and that of the Grecians , had the same beginning , ( at feasts and thanksgiving , as it has been observed ,) and the old comedy of the Greeks , which was invective , and the satire of the Romans , which was of the same nature , were begun on the very same occasion , so the fortune of both , in process of time , was just the same ; the old comedy of the Grecians was forbidden , for its too much licence in exposing of particular persons ; and the rude satire of the Romans was also punished by a law of the Decemviri , as Horace tells us , in these words :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Libertasque recurrentes accepta per annos</l>
     <l n="2">Lusit amabiliter ; donec jam sævus apertam</l>
     <l n="3">In rabiem verti coepit jocus , et per honestas</l>
     <l n="4">Ire domos impune minax : doluere cruento</l>
     <l n="5">Dente lacessiti ; fuit intactis quoque cura</l>
     <l n="6">Conditione super communi : quinetiam lex ,</l>
     <l n="7">Poenaque lata , malo quæ nollet carmine quenquam</l>
     <l n="8">Describi : vertere modum , formidine fustis</l>
     <l n="9">Ad benedicendum delectandumque redacti .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The law of the Decemviri was this : Siquis occentassit malum carmen , sive condidisit , quod infamiam faxit , flagitiumve alteri , capital esto .— A strange likeness , and barely possible ; but the critics being all of the same opinion , it becomes me to be silent , and to submit to better judgments than my own .</p>
   <p>But , to return to the Grecians , from whose satiric dramas the elder Scaliger and Heinsius will have the Roman satire to proceed , I am to take a view of them first , and see if there be any such descent from them as those authors have pretended .</p>
   <p>Thespis , or whoever he were that invented tragedy , ( for authors differ ,) mingled with them a chorus and dances of Satyrs , which had before been used in the celebration of their festivals ; and there they were ever afterwards retained . The character of them was also kept , which was mirth and wantonness ; and this was given , I suppose , to the folly of the common audience , who soon grow weary of good sense , and , as we daily see in our own age and country , are apt to forsake poetry , and still ready to return to buffoonery and farce . From hence it came , that , in the Olympic games , where the poets contended for four prizes , the satiric tragedy was the last of them ; for , in the rest , the Satyrs were excluded from the chorus . Among the plays of Euripides which are yet remaining , there is one of these SATYRICS , which is called “ The Cyclops ; ” in which we may see the nature of those poems , and from thence conclude , what likeness they have to the Roman SATIRE .</p>
   <p>The story of this Cyclops , whose name was Polyphemus , so famous in the Grecian fables , was , that Ulysses , who , with his company , was driven on the coast of Sicily , where those Cyclops inhabited , coming to ask relief from Silenus , and the Satyrs , who were herdsmen to that one-eyed giant , was kindly received by them , and entertained ; till , being perceived by Polyphemus , they were made prisoners against the rites of hospitality , ( for which Ulysses eloquently pleaded ,) were afterwards put down into the den , and some of them devoured ; after which Ulysses , having made him drunk , when he was asleep , thrust a great firebrand into his eye , and so , revenging his dead followers , escaped with the remaining party of the living ; and Silenus and the Satyrs were freed from their servitude under Polyphemus , and remitted to their first liberty of attending and accompanying their patron , Bacchus .</p>
   <p>This was the subject of the tragedy ; which , being one of those that end with a happy event , is therefore , by Aristotle , judged below the other sort , whose success is unfortunate . Notwithstanding which , the Satyrs , who were part of the dramatis personæ , as well as the whole chorus , were properly introduced into the nature of the poem , which is mixed of farce and tragedy . The adventure of Ulysses was to entertain the judging part of the audience ; and the uncouth persons of Silenus , and the Satyrs , to divert the common people with their gross railleries .</p>
   <p>Your lordship has perceived by this time , that this SATIRIC tragedy , and the Roman SATIRE , have little resemblance in any of their features . The very kinds are different ; for what has a pastoral tragedy to do with a paper of verses satirically written ? The character and raillery of the Satyrs is the only thing that could pretend to a likeness , were Scaliger and Heinsius alive to maintain their opinion . And the first farces of the Romans , which were the rudiments of their poetry , were written before they had any communication with the Greeks , or indeed any knowledge of that people .</p>
   <p>And here it will be proper to give the definition of the Greek satyric poem from Casaubon , before I leave this subject . “ The SATIRIC , ” says he , “ is a dramatic poem , annexed to a tragedy , having a chorus , which consists of Satyrs . The persons represented in it are illustrious men ; the action of it is great ; the style is partly serious , and partly jocular ; and the event of the action most commonly is happy . ”</p>
   <p>The Grecians , besides these SATIRIC tragedies , had another kind of poem , which they called Silli , which were more of kin to the Roman satire . Those Silli were indeed invective poems , but of a different species from the Roman poems of Ennius , Pacuvius , Lucilius , Horace , and the rest of their successors . They were so called , says Casaubon in one place , from Silenus , the foster-father of Bacchus ; but , in another place , bethinking himself better , he derives their name , # apo tou sillainein #, from their scoffing and petulancy . From some fragments of the Silli , written by Timon , we may find , that they were satiric poems , full of parodies ; that is , of verses patched up from great poets , and turned into another sense than their author intended them . Such , amongst the Romans , is the famous Cento of Ausonius ; where the words are Virgil 's , but , by applying them to another sense , they are made a relation of a wedding-night ; and the act of consummation fulsomely described in the very words of the most modest amongst all poets . Of the same manner are our songs , which are turned into burlesque , and the serious words of the author perverted into a ridiculous meaning . Thus in Timon 's Silli the words are generally those of Homer , and the tragic poets ; but he applies them , satirically , to some customs and kinds of philosophy , which he arraigns . But the Romans , not using any of these parodies in their satires ,— sometimes , indeed , repeating verses of other men , as Persius cites some of Nero 's , but not turning them into another meaning ,— the Silli cannot be supposed to be the original of Roman satire . To these Silli , consisting of parodies , we may properly add the satires which were written against particular persons ; such as were the Iambics of Archilochus against Lycambes , which Horace undoubtedly imitated in some of his Odes and Epodes , whose titles bear sufficient witness of it . I might also name the invective of Ovid against Ibis , and many others ; but these are the under-wood of satire , rather than the timber-trees : they are not of general extension , as reaching only to some individual person . And Horace seems to have purged himself from those splenetic reflections in those Odes and Epodes , before he undertook the noble work of Satires , which were properly so called .</p>
   <p>Thus , my lord , I have at length disengaged myself from those antiquities of Greece ; and have proved , I hope , from the best critics , that the Roman satire was not borrowed from thence , but of their own manufacture . I am now almost gotten into my depth ; at least , by the help of Dacier , I am swimming towards it . Not that I will promise always to follow him , any more than he follows Casaubon ; but to keep him in my eye , as my best and truest guide ; and where I think he may possibly mislead me , there to have recourse to my own lights , as I expect that others should do by me .</p>
   <p>Quintilian says , in plain words , Satira quidem tota nostra est ; and Horace had said the same thing before him , speaking of his predecessor in that sort of poetry ,— Et Græcis intacti carminis auctor . Nothing can be clearer than the opinion of the poet , and the orator , both the best critics of the two best ages of the Roman empire , that satire was wholly of Latin growth , and not transplanted to Rome from Athens .<span type="note_anchor">[ 20 ]</span>Yet , as I have said , Scaliger , the father , according to his custom , that is , insolently enough , contradicts them both ; and gives no better reason , than the derivation of satyrus from # sathy #, salacitas ; and so , from the lechery of those fauns , thinks he has sufficiently proved , that satire is derived from them : as if wantonness and lubricity were essential to that sort of poem , which ought to be avoided in it . His other allegation , which I have already mentioned , is as pitiful ; that the Satyrs carried platters and canisters full of fruit in their hands . If they had entered empty-handed , had they been ever the less Satyrs ? Or were the fruits and flowers , which they offered , any thing of kin to satire ? Or any argument that this poem was originally Grecian ? Casaubon judged better , and his opinion is grounded on sure authority , that satire was derived from satura , a Roman word , which signifies — full and abundant , and full also of variety , in which nothing is wanting to its due perfection . It is thus , says Dacier , that we say — a full colour , when the wool has taken the whole tincture , and drunk in as much of the dye as it can receive . According to this derivation , from satur comes satura , or satyra , according to the new spelling ; as optumus and maxumus are now spelled optimus and maximus . Satura , as I have formerly noted , is an adjective , and relates to the word lanx which is understood ; and this lanx , in English a charger , or large platter , was yearly filled with all sorts of fruits , which were offered to the gods at their festivals , as the premices , or first gatherings . These offerings of several sorts thus mingled , it is true , were not unknown to the Grecians , who called them # pankarpon thysian #, a sacrifice of all sorts of fruits ; and # panpermian #, when they offered all kinds of grain .</p>
   <p>Virgil has mentioned these sacrifices in his “ Georgics : ”</p>
   <p>Lancibus et pandis fumantia reddimus exta :</p>
   <p>and in another place , lancesque et liba feremus : that is , We offer the smoaking entrails in great platters , and we will offer the chargers and the cakes .</p>
   <p>The word satura has been afterwards applied to many other sort of mixtures ; as Festus calls it a kind of olla , or hotchpotch , made of several sorts of meats . Laws were also called leges saturæ , when they were of several heads and titles , like our tacked bills of parliament : and per saturam legem ferre , in the Roman senate , was to carry a law without telling the senators , or counting voices , when they were in haste . Sallust uses the word ,— per saturam sententias exquirere ; when the majority was visible on one side . From hence it may probably be conjectured , that the Discourses , or Satires , of Ennius , Lucilius , and Horace , as we now call them , took their name ; because they are full of various matters , and are also written on various subjects , as Porphyrius says . But Dacier affirms , that it is not immediately from thence that these satires are so called ; for that name had been used formerly for other things , which bore a nearer resemblance to those discourses of Horace . In explaining of which , continues Dacier , a method is to be pursued , of which Casaubon himself has never thought , and which will put all things into so clear a light , that no farther room will be left for the least dispute .</p>
   <p>During the space of almost four hundred years , since the building of their city , the Romans had never known any entertainments of the stage . Chance and jollity first found out those verses which they called Saturnian , and Fescennine ; or rather human nature , which is inclined to poetry , first produced them , rude and barbarous , and unpolished , as all other operations of the soul are in their beginnings , before they are cultivated with art and study . However , in occasions of merriment they were first practised ; and this rough-cast unhewn poetry was instead of stage-plays , for the space of an hundred and twenty years together . They were made extempore , and were , as the French call them , impromptùs ; for which the Tarsians of old were much renowned ; and we see the daily examples of them in the Italian farces of Harlequin and Scaramucha . Such was the poetry of that savage people , before it was turned into numbers , and the harmony of verse . Little of the Saturnian verses is now remaining ; we only know from authors , that they were nearer prose than poetry , without feet , or measure . They were # enrythmoi #, but not # emmetroi #. Perhaps they might be used in the solemn part of their ceremonies ; and the Fescennine , which were invented after them , in the afternoon 's debauchery , because they were scoffing and obscene .</p>
   <p>The Fescennine and Saturnian were the same ; for as they were called Saturnian from their ancientness , when Saturn reigned in Italy , they were also called Fescennine , from Fescennia , a town in the same country , where they were first practised . The actors , with a gross and rustic kind of raillery , reproached each other with their failings ; and at the same time were nothing sparing of it to their audience . Somewhat of this custom was afterwards retained in the Saturnalia , or feasts of Saturn , celebrated in December ; at least all kind of freedom in speech was then allowed to slaves , even against their masters ; and we are not without some imitation of it in our Christmas gambols . Soldiers also used those Fescennine verses , after measure and numbers had been added to them , at the triumph of their generals : of which we have an example , in the triumph of Julius Cæsar over Gaul , in these expressions : Cæsar Gallias subegit , Nicomedes Cæsarem . Ecce Cæsar nunc triumphat , qui subegit Gallias : Nicomedes non triumphat , qui subegit Cæsarem . The vapours of wine made those first satirical poets amongst the Romans ; which , says Dacier , we cannot better represent , than by imagining a company of clowns on a holiday , dancing lubberly , and upbraiding one another , in extempore doggrel , with their defects and vices , and the stories that were told of them in bake houses and barbers ’ shops .</p>
   <p>When they began to be somewhat better bred , and were entering , as I may say , into the first rudiments of civil conversation , they left these hedge-notes for another sort of poem , somewhat polished , which was also full of pleasant raillery , but without any mixture of obscenity . This sort of poetry appeared under the name of satire , because of its variety ; and this satire was adorned with compositions of music , and with dances ; but lascivious postures were banished from it . In the Tuscan language , says Livy , the word hister signifies a player ; and therefore those actors , which were first brought from Etruria to Rome , on occasion of a pestilence , when the Romans were admonished to avert the anger of the Gods by plays , in the year ab urbe condita CCCXC .,— those actors , I say , were therefore called histriones ; and that name has since remained , not only to actors Roman born , but to all others of every nation . They played not the former extempore stuff of Fescennine verses , or clownish jests ; but what they acted was a kind of civil , cleanly farce , with music and dances , and motions that were proper to the subject .</p>
   <p>In this condition Livius Andronicus found the stage , when he attempted first , instead of farces , to supply it with a nobler entertainment of tragedies and comedies . This man was a Grecian born , and being made a slave by Livius Salinator , and brought to Rome , had the education of his patron 's children committed to him ; which trust he discharged so much to the satisfaction of his master , that he gave him his liberty .</p>
   <p>Andronicus , thus become a freeman of Rome , added to his own name that of Livius his master ; and , as I observed , was the first author of a regular play in that commonwealth . Being already instructed , in his native country , in the manners and decencies of the Athenian theatre , and conversant in the Archæa Comoedia , or old comedy of Aristophanes , and the rest of the Grecian poets , he took from that model his own designing of plays for the Roman stage ; the first of which was represented in the year CCCCCXIV ., since the building of Rome , as Tully , from the commentaries of Atticus , has assured us : it was after the end of the first Punic war , the year before Ennius was born . Dacier has not carried the matter altogether thus far ; he only says , that one Livius Andronicus was the first stage-poet at Rome . But I will adventure on this hint , to advance another proposition , which I hope the learned will approve . And though we have not any thing of Andronicus remaining to justify my conjecture , yet it is exceedingly probable , that , having read the works of those Grecian wits , his countrymen , he imitated not only the ground work , but also the manner of their writing ; and how grave soever his tragedies might be , yet , in his comedies , he expressed the way of Aristophanes , Eupolis , and the rest , which was to call some persons by their own names , and to expose their defects to the laughter of the people : the examples of which we have in the forementioned Aristophanes , who turned the wise Socrates into ridicule , and is also very free with the management of Cleon , Alcibiades , and other ministers of the Athenian government . Now , if this be granted , we may easily suppose , that the first hint of satirical plays on the Roman stage was given by the Greeks : not from the Satirica , for that has been reasonably exploded in the former part of this discourse : but from their old comedy , which was imitated first by Livius Andronicus . And then Quintilian and Horace must be cautiously interpreted , where they affirm , that satire is wholly Roman , and a sort of verse , which was not touched on by the Grecians . The reconcilement of my opinion to the standard of their judgment is not , however , very difficult , since they spoke of satire , not as in its first elements , but as it was formed into a separate work ; begun by Ennius , pursued by Lucilius , and completed afterwards by Horace . The proof depends only on this postulatum ,— that the comedies of Andronicus , which were imitations of the Greek , were also imitations of their railleries , and reflections on particular persons . For , if this be granted me , which is a most probable supposition , it is easy to infer , that the first light which was given to the Roman theatrical satire , was from the plays of Livius Andronicus ; which will be more manifestly discovered , when I come to speak of Ennius . In the meantime I will return to Dacier .</p>
   <p>The people , says he , ran in crowds to these new entertainments of Andronicus , as to pieces which were more noble in their kind , and more perfect than their former satires , which for some time they neglected and abandoned . But not long after , they took them up again , and then they joined them to their comedies ; playing them at the end of every drama , as the French continue at this day to act their farces , in the nature of a separate entertainment from their tragedies . But more particularly they were joined to the Atellane fables , says Casaubon ; which were plays invented by the Osci . Those fables , says Valerius Maximus , out of Livy , were tempered with the Italian severity , and free from any note of infamy , or obsceneness ; and , as an old commentator of Juvenal affirms , the Exodiarii , which were singers and dancers , entered to entertain the people with light songs , and mimical gestures , that they might not go away oppressed with melancholy , from those serious pieces of the theatre . So that the ancient satire of the Romans was in extempore reproaches ; the next was farce , which was brought from Tuscany ; to that succeeded the plays of Andronicus , from the old comedy of the Grecians ; and out of all these sprung two several branches of new Roman satire , like different scions from the same root , which I shall prove with as much brevity as the subject will allow .</p>
   <p>A year after Andronicus had opened the Roman stage with his new dramas , Ennius was born ; who , when he was grown to man 's estate , having seriously considered the genius of the people , and how eagerly they followed the first satires , thought it would be worth his pains to refine upon the project , and to write Satires , not to be acted on the theatre , but read . He preserved the ground-work of their pleasantry , their venom , and their raillery on particular persons , and general vices ; and by this means , avoiding the danger of any ill success in a public representation , he hoped to be as well received in the cabinet , as Andronicus had been upon the stage . The event was answerable to his expectation . He made discourses in several sorts of verse , varied often in the same paper ; retaining still in the title their original name of Satire . Both in relation to the subjects , and the variety of matters contained in them , the Satires of Horace are entirely like them ; only Ennius , as I said , confines not himself to one sort of verse , as Horace does ; but , taking example from the Greeks , and even from Homer himself in his MARGITES , which is a kind of Satire , as Scaliger observes , gives himself the licence , when one sort of numbers comes not easily , to run into another , as his fancy dictates . For he makes no difficulty to mingle hexameter with iambick trimeters , or with trochaick tetrameters ; as appears by those fragments which are yet remaining of him . Horace has thought him worthy to be copied ; inserting many things of his into his own Satires , as Virgil has done into his Æneids .</p>
   <p>Here we have Dacier making out that Ennius was the first satirist in that way of writing , which was of his invention ; that is , satire abstracted from the stage , and new modelled into papers of verses on several subjects . But he will have Ennius take the ground-work of satire from the first farces of the Romans , rather than from the formed plays of Livius Andronicus , which were copied from the Grecian comedies . It may possibly be so ; but Dacier knows no more of it than I do . And it seems to me the more probable opinion , that he rather imitated the fine railleries of the Greeks , which he saw in the pieces of Andronicus , than the coarseness of his old countrymen , in their clownish extemporary way of jeering .</p>
   <p>But besides this , it is universally granted , that Ennius , though an Italian , was excellently learned in the Greek language . His verses were stuffed with fragments of it , even to a fault ; and he himself believed , according to the Pythagorean opinion , that the soul of Homer was transfused into him ; which Persius observes , in his Sixth Satire :— Postquam destertuit esse Mæonides . But this being only the private opinion of so inconsiderable a man as I am , I leave it to the farther disquisition of the critics , if they think it worth their notice . Most evident it is , that whether he imitated the Roman farce , or the Greek comedies , he is to be acknowledged for the first author of Roman satire , as it is properly so called , and distinguished from any sort of stage-play .</p>
   <p>Of Pacuvius , who succeeded him , there is little to be said , because there is so little remaining of him ; only that he is taken to be the nephew of Ennius , his sister 's son ; that in probability he was instructed by his uncle , in his way of satire , which we are told he has copied : but what advances he made we know not .</p>
   <p>Lucilius came into the world , when Pacuvius flourished most . He also made satires after the manner of Ennius , but he gave them a more graceful turn , and endeavoured to imitate more closely the vetus comoedia of the Greeks , of the which the old original Roman satire had no idea , till the time of Livius Andronicus . And though Horace seems to have made Lucilius the first author of satire in verse amongst the Romans , in these words ,—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">—— Quid ? cum est Lucilius ausus</l>
     <l n="2">Primus in hunc , operis componere carmina morem ,—</l>
   </lg>
   <p>he is only thus to be understood ; that Lucilius had given a more graceful turn to the satire of Ennius and Pacuvius , not that he invented a new satire of his own : and Quintilian seems to explain this passage of Horace in these words : Satira quidem tota nostra est ; in quâ primus insignem laudem adeptus est Lucilius .</p>
   <p>Thus , both Horace and Quintilian give a kind of primacy of honour to Lucilius , amongst the Latin satirists .<span type="note_anchor">[ 21 ]</span>For , as the Roman language grew more refined , so much more capable it was of receiving the Grecian beauties , in his time . Horace and Quintilian could mean no more , than that Lucilius writ better than Ennius and Pacuvius ; and on the same account we prefer Horace to Lucilius . Both of them imitated the old Greek comedy ; and so did Ennius and Pacuvius before them . The polishing of the Latin tongue , in the succession of times , made the only difference ; and Horace himself , in two of his Satires , written purposely on this subject , thinks the Romans of his age were too partial in their commendations of Lucilius ; who writ not only loosely , and muddily , with little art , and much less care , but also in a time when the Latin tongue was not yet sufficiently purged from the dregs of barbarism ; and many significant and sounding words , which the Romans wanted , were not admitted even in the times of Lucretius and Cicero , of which both complain .</p>
   <p>But to proceed :— Dacier justly taxes Casaubon , saying , that the Satires of Lucilius were wholly different in specie , from those of Ennius and Pacuvius . Casaubon was led into that mistake by Diomedes the grammarian , who in effect says this : “ Satire amongst the Romans , but not amongst the Greeks , was a biting invective poem , made after the model of the ancient comedy , for the reprehension of vices ; such as were the poems of Lucilius , of Horace , and of Persius . But in former times , the name of Satire was given to poems , which were composed of several sorts of verses , such as were made by Ennius and Pacuvius ; more fully expressing the etymology of the word satire , from satura , which we have observed . ” Here it is manifest , that Diomedes makes a specifical distinction betwixt the Satires of Ennius , and those of Lucilius . But this , as we say in English , is only a distinction without a difference ; for the reason of it is ridiculous , and absolutely false . This was that which cozened honest Casaubon , who , relying on Diomedes , had not sufficiently examined the origin and nature of those two satires ; which were entirely the same , both in the matter and the form : for all that Lucilius performed beyond his predecessors , Ennius and Pacuvius , was only the adding of more politeness , and more salt , without any change in the substance of the poem . And though Lucilius put not together in the same satire several sorts of verses , as Ennius did , yet he composed several satires , of several sorts of verses , and mingled them with Greek verses : one poem consisted only of hexameters , and another was entirely of iambicks ; a third of trochaicks ; as is visible by the fragments yet remaining of his works . In short , if the Satires of Lucilius are therefore said to be wholly different from those of Ennius , because he added much more of beauty and polishing to his own poems , than are to be found in those before him , it will follow from hence , that the Satires of Horace are wholly different from those of Lucilius , because Horace has not less surpassed Lucilius in the elegancy of his writing , than Lucilius surpassed Ennius in the turn and ornament of his . This passage of Diomedes has also drawn Dousa , the son , into the same error of Casaubon , which I say , not to expose the little failings of those judicious men , but only to make it appear , with how much diffidence and caution we are to read their works , when they treat a subject of so much obscurity , and so very ancient , as is this of satire .</p>
   <p>Having thus brought down the history of Satire from its original to the times of Horace , and shown the several changes of it , I should here discover some of those graces which Horace added to it , but that I think it will be more proper to defer that undertaking , till I make the comparison betwixt him and Juvenal . In the mean while , following the order of time , it will be necessary to say somewhat of another kind of satire , which also was descended from the ancients ; it is that which we call the Varronian satire , ( but which Varro himself calls the Menippean ,) because Varro , the most learned of the Romans , was the first author of it , who imitated , in his works , the manner of Menippus the Gadarenian , who professed the philosophy of the Cynicks .</p>
   <p>This sort of satire was not only composed of several sorts of verse , like those of Ennius , but was also mixed with prose ; and Greek was sprinkled amongst the Latin . Quintilian , after he had spoken of the satire of Lucilius , adds what follows ; “ There is another and former kind of satire , composed by Terentius Varro , the most learned of the Romans ; in which he was not satisfied alone with mingling in it several sorts of verse . ” The only difficulty of this passage is , that Quintilian tells us , that this satire of Varro was of a former kind . For how can we possibly imagine this to be , since Varro , who was contemporary to Cicero , must consequently be after Lucilius ? But Quintilian meant not , that the satire of Varro was in order of time before Lucilius ; he would only give us to understand , that the Varronian satire , with mixture of several sorts of verses , was more after the manner of Ennius and Pacuvius , than that of Lucilius , who was more severe , and more correct ; and gave himself less liberty in the mixture of his verses in the same poem .</p>
   <p>We have nothing remaining of those Varronian satires , excepting some inconsiderable fragments , and those for the most part much corrupted . The titles of many of them are indeed preserved , and they are generally double ; from whence , at least , we may understand , how many various subjects were treated by that author . Tully , in his “ Academics , ” introduces Varro himself giving us some light concerning the scope and design of those works . Wherein , after he had shown his reasons why he did not ex professo write of philosophy , he adds what follows : “ Notwithstanding , ” says he , “ that those pieces of mine , wherein I have imitated Menippus , though I have not translated him , are sprinkled with a kind of mirth and gaiety , yet many things are there inserted , which are drawn from the very entrails of philosophy , and many things severely argued ; which I have mingled with pleasantries on purpose , that they may more easily go down with the common sort of unlearned readers . ” The rest of the sentence is so lame , that we can only make thus much out of it ,— that in the composition of his satires , he so tempered philology with philosophy , that his work was a mixture of them both .<span type="note_anchor">[ 22 ]</span>And Tully himself confirms us in this opinion , when a little after he addresses himself to Varro in these words :— “ And you yourself have composed a most elegant and complete poem ; you have begun philosophy in many places ; sufficient to incite us , though too little to instruct us . ” Thus it appears , that Varro was one of those writers whom they called # spoudogeloioi #, studious of laughter ; and that , as learned as he was , his business was more to divert his reader , than to teach him . And he entitled his own satires — Menippean ; not that Menippus had written any satires , ( for his were either dialogues or epistles ,) but that Varro imitated his style , his manner , his facetiousness . All that we know farther of Menippus and his writings , which are wholly lost , is , that by some he is esteemed , as , amongst the rest , by Varro ; by others he is noted of cynical impudence , and obscenity : that he was much given to those parodies , which I have already mentioned ; that is , he often quoted the verses of Homer and the tragic poets , and turned their serious meaning into something that was ridiculous ; whereas Varro 's satires are by Tully called absolute , and most elegant , and various poems . Lucian , who was emulous of this Menippus , seems to have imitated both his manners and his style in many of his dialogues ; where Menippus himself is often introduced as a speaker in them , and as a perpetual buffoon ; particularly his character is expressed in the beginning of that dialogue , which is called # Nekyomantia #. But Varro , in imitating him , avoids his impudence and filthiness , and only expresses his witty pleasantry .</p>
   <p>This we may believe for certain ,— that as his subjects were various , so most of them were tales or stories of his own invention . Which is also manifest from antiquity , by those authors who are acknowledged to have written Varronian satires , in imitation of his ; of whom the chief is Petronius Arbiter , whose satire , they say , is now printed in Holland , wholly recovered , and made complete : when it is made public , it will easily be seen by any one sentence , whether it be supposititious , or genuine .<span type="note_anchor">[ 23 ]</span>Many of Lucian 's dialogues may also properly be called Varronian satires , particularly his True History ; and consequently the “ Golden Ass ” of Apuleius , which is taken from him . Of the same stamp is the mock deification of Claudius , by Seneca : and the Symposium or “ Cæsars ” of Julian , the Emperor . Amongst the moderns , we may reckon the “ Encomium Moriæ ” of Erasmus , Barclay 's “ Euphormio , ” and a volume of German authors , which my ingenious friend , Mr Charles Killegrew , once lent me .<span type="note_anchor">[ 24 ]</span>In the English , I remember none which are mixed with prose , as Varro 's were ; but of the same kind is “ Mother Hubbard 's Tale ” in Spenser ; and ( if it be not too vain to mention any thing of my own ,) the poems of “ Absalom ” and “ Mac Flecnoe . "[ 25 ]</p>
   <p>This is what I have to say in general of satire : only , as Dacier has observed before me , we may take notice , that the word satire is of a more general signification in Latin , than in French , or English . For amongst the Romans it was not only used for those discourses which decried vice , or exposed folly , but for others also , where virtue was recommended . But in our modern languages we apply it only to invective poems , where the very name of satire is formidable to those persons , who would appear to the world what they are not in themselves ; for in English , to say satire , is to mean reflection , as we use that word in the worst sense ; or as the French call it , more properly , medisance . In the criticism of spelling , it ought to be with i , and not with y , to distinguish its true derivation from satura , not from satyrus . And if this be so , then it is false spelled throughout this book ; for here it is written SATYR : which having not considered at the first , I thought it not worth correcting afterwards . But the French are more nice , and never spell it any other way than SATIRE .</p>
   <p>I am now arrived at the most difficult part of my undertaking , which is , to compare Horace with Juvenal and Persius . It is observed by Rigaltius , in his preface before Juvenal , written to Thuanus , that these three poets have all their particular partisans , and favourers . Every commentator , as he has taken pains with any of them , thinks himself obliged to prefer his author to the other two ; to find out their failings , and decry them , that he may make room for his own darling .<span type="note_anchor">[ 26 ]</span>Such is the partiality of mankind , to set up that interest which they have once espoused , though it be to the prejudice of truth , morality , and common justice ; and especially in the productions of the brain . As authors generally think themselves the best poets , because they cannot go out of themselves to judge sincerely of their betters ; so it is with critics , who , having first taken a liking to one of these poets , proceed to comment on him , and to illustrate him ; after which , they fall in love with their own labours , to that degree of blind fondness , that at length they defend and exalt their author , not so much for his sake as for their own . It is a folly of the same nature , with that of the Romans themselves , in the games of the Circus . The spectators were divided in their factions , betwixt the Veneti and the Prasini ; some were for the charioteer in blue , and some for him in green . The colours themselves were but a fancy ; but when once a man had taken pains to set out those of his party , and had been at the trouble of procuring voices for them , the case was altered ; he was concerned for his own labour , and that so earnestly , that disputes and quarrels , animosities , commotions , and bloodshed , often happened ; and in the declension of the Grecian empire , the very sovereigns themselves engaged in it , even when the barbarians were at their doors ; and stickled for the preference of colours , when the safety of their people was in question . I am now myself on the brink of the same precipice ; I have spent some time on the translation of Juvenal and Persius ; and it behoves me to be wary , lest , for that reason , I should be partial to them , or take a prejudice against Horace . Yet , on the other side , I would not be like some of our judges , who would give the cause for a poor man , right or wrong ; for though that be an error on the better hand , yet it is still a partiality : and a rich man , unheard , cannot be concluded an oppressor . I remember a saying of King Charles II . on Sir Matthew Hale , ( who was doubtless an uncorrupt and upright man ,) that his servants were sure to be cast on a trial , which was heard before him ; not that he thought the judge was possibly to be bribed , but that his integrity might be too scrupulous ; and that the causes of the crown were always suspicious , when the privileges of subjects were concerned .<span type="note_anchor">[ 27 ]</span></p>
   <p>It had been much fairer , if the modern critics , who have embarked in the quarrels of their favourite authors , had rather given to each his proper due ; without taking from another 's heap , to raise their own . There is praise enough for each of them in particular , without encroaching on his fellows , and detracting from them , or enriching themselves with the spoils of others . But to come to particulars . Heinsius and Dacier are the most principal of those , who raise Horace above Juvenal and Persius . Scaliger the father , Rigaltius , and many others , debase Horace , that they may set up Juvenal ; and Casaubon ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 28 ]</span>who is almost single , throws dirt on Juvenal and Horace , that he may exalt Persius , whom he understood particularly well , and better than any of his former commentators ; even Stelluti , who succeeded him . I will begin with him , who , in my opinion , defends the weakest cause , which is that of Persius ; and labouring , as Tacitus professes of his own writing , to divest myself of partiality , or prejudice , consider Persius , not as a poet whom I have wholly translated , and who has cost me more labour and time than Juvenal , but according to what I judge to be his own merit ; which I think not equal , in the main , to that of Juvenal or Horace , and yet in some things to be preferred to both of them .</p>
   <p>First , then , for the verse ; neither Casaubon himself , nor any for him , can defend either his numbers , or the purity of his Latin . Casaubon gives this point for lost , and pretends not to justify either the measures , or the words of Persius ; he is evidently beneath Horace and Juvenal in both .</p>
   <p>Then , as his verse is scabrous , and hobbling , and his words not every where well chosen , the purity of Latin being more corrupted than in the time of Juvenal ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 29 ]</span>and consequently of Horace , who writ when the language was in the height of its perfection , so his diction is hard , his figures are generally too bold and daring , and his tropes , particularly his metaphors , insufferably strained .</p>
   <p>In the third place , notwithstanding all the diligence of Casaubon , Stelluti , and a Scotch gentleman ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 30 ]</span>whom I have heard extremely commended for his illustrations of him , yet he is still obscure : whether he affected not to be understood , but with difficulty ; or whether the fear of his safety under Nero compelled him to this darkness in some places ; or that it was occasioned by his close way of thinking , and the brevity of his style , and crowding of his figures ; or lastly , whether , after so long a time , many of his words have been corrupted , and many customs , and stories relating to them , lost to us : whether some of these reasons , or all , concurred to render him so cloudy , we may be bold to affirm , that the best of commentators can but guess at his meaning , in many passages ; and none can be certain that he has divined rightly .</p>
   <p>After all , he was a young man , like his friend and contemporary Lucan ; both of them men of extraordinary parts , and great acquired knowledge , considering their youth :[ 31 ] But neither of them had arrived to that maturity of judgment , which is necessary to the accomplishing of a formed poet . And this consideration , as , on the one hand , it lays some imperfections to their charge , so , on the other side , it is a candid excuse for those failings , which are incident to youth and inexperience ; and we have more reason to wonder how they , who died before the thirtieth year of their age , could write so well , and think so strongly , than to accuse them of those faults , from which human nature , and more especially in youth , can never possibly be exempted .</p>
   <p>To consider Persius yet more closely : he rather insulted over vice and folly , than exposed them , like Juvenal and Horace ; and as chaste and modest as he is esteemed , it cannot be denied , but that in some places he is broad and fulsome , as the latter verses of the fourth Satire , and of the sixth , sufficiently witnessed . And it is to be believed that he who commits the same crime often , and without necessity , cannot but do it with some kind of pleasure .</p>
   <p>To come to a conclusion : he is manifestly below Horace , because he borrows most of his greatest beauties from him ; and Casaubon is so far from denying this , that he has written a treatise purposely concerning it ; wherein he shews a multitude of his translations from Horace , and his imitations of him , for the credit of his author ; which he calls Imitatio Horatiana .<span type="note_anchor">[ 32 ]</span></p>
   <p>To these defects , which I casually observed , while I was translating this author , Scaliger has added others ; he calls him , in plain terms , a silly writer , and a trifler , full of ostentation of his learning , and , after all , unworthy to come into competition with Juvenal and Horace .</p>
   <p>After such terrible accusations , it is time to hear what his patron Casaubon can allege in his defence . Instead of answering , he excuses for the most part ; and , when he cannot , accuses others of the same crimes . He deals with Scaliger , as a modest scholar with a master . He compliments him with so much reverence , that one would swear he feared him as much at least as he respected him . Scaliger will not allow Persius to have any wit ; Casaubon interprets this in the mildest sense , and confesses his author was not good at turning things into a pleasant ridicule ; or , in other words , that he was not a laughable writer . That he was ineptus , indeed , but that was non aptissimus ad jocandum ; but that he was ostentatious of his learning , that , by Scaliger 's good favour , he denies . Persius shewed his learning , but was no boaster of it ; he did ostendere , but not ostentare ; and so , he says , did Scaliger :— where , methinks , Casaubon turns it handsomely upon that supercilious critic , and silently insinuates that he himself was sufficiently vain-glorious , and a boaster of his own knowledge . All the writings of this venerable censor , continues Casaubon , which are # chrysou chrysotera #, more golden than gold itself , are every where smelling of that thyme , which , like a bee , he has gathered from ancient authors ; but far be ostentation and vain-glory from a gentleman so well born , and so nobly educated as Scaliger . But , says Scaliger , he is so obscure , that he has got himself the name of Scotinus , a dark writer ; now , says Casaubon , it is a wonder to me that any thing could be obscure to the divine wit of Scaliger , from which nothing could be hidden . This is indeed a strong compliment , but no defence ; and Casaubon , who could not but be sensible of his author 's blind side , thinks it time to abandon a post that was untenable . He acknowledges that Persius is obscure in some places ; but so is Plato , so is Thucydides ; so are Pindar , Theocritus , and Aristophanes , amongst the Greek poets ; and even Horace and Juvenal , he might have added , amongst the Romans . The truth is , Persius is not sometimes , but generally , obscure ; and therefore Casaubon , at last , is forced to excuse him , by alledging that it was se defendendo , for fear of Nero ; and that he was commanded to write so cloudily by Cornutus ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 33 ]</span>in virtue of holy obedience to his master . I cannot help my own opinion ; I think Cornutus needed not to have read many lectures to him on that subject . Persius was an apt scholar ; and when he was bidden to be obscure in some places , where his life and safety were in question , took the same counsel for all his books ; and never afterwards wrote ten lines together clearly . Casaubon , being upon this chapter , has not failed , we may be sure , of making a compliment to his own dear comment . If Persius , says he , be in himself obscure , yet my interpretation has made him intelligible . There is no question but he deserves that praise , which he has given to himself ; but the nature of the thing , as Lucretius says , will not admit of a perfect explanation . Besides many examples which I could urge , the very last verse of his last satire , upon which he particularly values himself in his preface , is not yet sufficiently explicated . It is true , Holyday has endeavoured to justify his construction ; but Stelluti is against it ; and , for my part , I can have but a very dark notion of it . As for the chastity of his thoughts , Casaubon denies not but that one particular passage , in the fourth satire , At si unctus cesses , &amp; c. is not only the most obscure , but the most obscene of all his works . I understood it ; but for that reason turned it over . In defence of his boisterous metaphors , he quotes Longinus , who accounts them as instruments of the sublime ; fit to move and stir up the affections , particularly in narration . To which it may be replied , that where the trope is far fetched and hard , it is fit for nothing but to puzzle the understanding ; and may be reckoned amongst those things of Demosthenes which Æschines called # thaumata #, not # rhêmata #, that is , prodigies , not words . It must be granted to Casaubon , that the knowledge of many things is lost in our modern ages , which were of familiar notice to the ancients ; and that satire is a poem of a difficult nature in itself , and is not written to vulgar readers : and through the relation which it has to comedy , the frequent change of persons makes the sense perplexed , when we can but divine who it is that speaks ; whether Persius himself , or his friend and monitor ; or , in some places , a third person . But Casaubon comes back always to himself , and concludes , that if Persius had not been obscure , there had been no need of him for an interpreter . Yet when he had once enjoined himself so hard a task , he then considered the Greek proverb , that he must # chelônes phagein ê mê phagein #, either eat the whole snail , or let it quite alone ; and so he went through with his laborious task , as I have done with my difficult translation .</p>
   <p>Thus far , my lord , you see it has gone very hard with Persius : I think he cannot be allowed to stand in competition either with Juvenal or Horace . Yet for once I will venture to be so vain , as to affirm , that none of his hard metaphors , or forced expressions , are in my translation . But more of this in its proper place , where I shall say somewhat in particular , of our general performance , in making these two authors English . In the mean time , I think myself obliged to give Persius his undoubted due , and to acquaint the world , with Casaubon , in what he has equalled , and in what excelled , his two competitors .</p>
   <p>A man who is resolved to praise an author , with any appearance of justice , must be sure to take him on the strongest side , and where he is least liable to exceptions . He is therefore obliged to chuse his mediums accordingly . Casaubon , who saw that Persius could not laugh with a becoming grace , that he was not made for jesting , and that a merry conceit was not his talent , turned his feather , like an Indian , to another light , that he might give it the better gloss . Moral doctrine , says he , and urbanity , or well-mannered wit , are the two things which constitute the Roman satire ; but of the two , that which is most essential to this poem , and is , as it were , the very soul which animates it , is the scourging of vice , and exhortation to virtue . Thus wit , for a good reason , is already almost out of doors ; and allowed only for an instrument , a kind of tool , or a weapon , as he calls it , of which the satirist makes use in the compassing of his design . The end and aim of our three rivals is consequently the same . But by what methods they have prosecuted their intention , is farther to be considered . Satire is of the nature of moral philosophy , as being instructive : he , therefore , who instructs most usefully , will carry the palm from his two antagonists . The philosophy in which Persius was educated , and which he professes through his whole book , is the Stoick ; the most noble , most generous , most beneficial to human kind , amongst all the sects , who have given us the rules of ethics , thereby to form a severe virtue in the soul ; to raise in us an undaunted courage against the assaults of fortune ; to esteem as nothing the things that are without us , because they are not in our power ; not to value riches , beauty , honours , fame , or health , any farther than as conveniencies , and so many helps to living as we ought , and doing good in our generation : in short , to be always happy , while we possess our minds with a good conscience , are free from the slavery of vices , and conform our actions and conversations to the rules of right reason . See here , my lord , an epitome of Epictetus ; the doctrine of Zeno , and the education of our Persius : and this he expressed , not only in all his satires , but in the manner of his life . I will not lessen this commendation of the Stoick philosophy , by giving you an account of some absurdities in their doctrine , and some perhaps impieties , if we consider them by the standard of christian faith . Persius has fallen into none of them ; and therefore is free from those imputations . What he teaches might be taught from pulpits , with more profit to the audience , than all the nice speculations of divinity , and controversies concerning faith ; which are more for the profit of the shepherd , than for the edification of the flock . Passions , interest , ambition , and all their bloody consequences of discord , and of war , are banished from this doctrine . Here is nothing proposed but the quiet and tranquillity of the mind ; virtue lodged at home , and afterwards diffused in her general effects , to the improvement and good of human kind . And therefore I wonder not that the present Bishop of Salisbury<span type="note_anchor">[ 34 ]</span>has recommended this our author , and the Tenth Satire of Juvenal , in his Pastoral Letter , to the serious perusal and practice of the divines in his diocese , as the best common-places for their sermons , as the store-houses and magazines of moral virtues , from whence they may draw out , as they have occasion , all manner of assistance for the accomplishment of a virtuous life , which the stoicks have assigned for the great end and perfection of mankind . Herein then it is , that Persius has excelled both Juvenal and Horace . He sticks to his own philosophy ; he shifts not sides , like Horace , who is sometimes an Epicurean , sometimes a Stoick , sometimes an Eclectic , as his present humour leads him ; nor declaims like Juvenal against vices , more like an orator , than a philosopher . Persius is every where the same ; true to the dogmas of his master . What he has learnt , he teaches vehemently ; and what he teaches , that he practises himself . There is a spirit of sincerity in all he says ; you may easily discern that he is in earnest , and is persuaded of that truth which he inculcates . In this I am of opinion that he excels Horace , who is commonly in jest , and laughs while he instructs ; and is equal to Juvenal , who was as honest and serious as Persius , and more he could not be .</p>
   <p>Hitherto I have followed Casaubon , and enlarged upon him , because I am satisfied that he says no more than truth ; the rest is almost all frivolous . For he says that Horace , being the son of a tax-gatherer , or a collector , as we call it , smells every where of the meanness of his birth and education : his conceipts are vulgar , like the subjects of his satires ; that he does plebeium sapere , and writes not with that elevation , which becomes a satirist : that Persius , being nobly born , and of an opulent family , had likewise the advantage of a better master ; Cornutus being the most learned of his time , a man of the most holy life , the chief of the Stoick sect at Rome , and not only a great philosopher , but a poet himself , and in probability a coadjutor of Persius : that , as for Juvenal , he was long a declaimer , came late to poetry , and has not been much conversant in philosophy .</p>
   <p>It is granted that the father of Horace was libertinus , that is , one degree removed from his grandfather , who had been once a slave . But Horace , speaking of him , gives him the best character of a father , which I ever read in history ; and I wish a witty friend of mine , now living , had such another .<span type="note_anchor">[ 35 ]</span>He bred him in the best school , and with the best company of young noblemen ; and Horace , by his gratitude to his memory , gives a certain testimony that his education was ingenuous . After this , he formed himself abroad , by the conversation of great men . Brutus found him at Athens , and was so pleased with him , that he took him thence into the army , and made him tribunus militum , a colonel in a legion , which was the preferment of an old soldier . All this was before his acquaintance with Mecænas , and his introduction into the court of Augustus , and the familiarity of that great emperor ; which , had he not been well-bred before , had been enough to civilize his conversation , and render him accomplished and knowing in all the arts of complacency and good behaviour ; and , in short , an agreeable companion for the retired hours and privacies of a favourite , who was first minister . So that , upon the whole matter , Persius may be acknowledged to be equal with him in those respects , though better born , and Juvenal inferior to both . If the advantage be any where , it is on the side of Horace ; as much as the court of Augustus Cæsar was superior to that of Nero . As for the subjects which they treated , it will appear hereafter , that Horace writ not vulgarly on vulgar subjects , nor always chose them . His style is constantly accommodated to his subject , either high or low . If his fault be too much lowness , that of Persius is the fault of the hardness of his metaphors , and obscurity : and so they are equal in the failings of their style ; where Juvenal manifestly triumphs over both of them .</p>
   <p>The comparison betwixt Horace and Juvenal is more difficult ; because their forces were more equal . A dispute has always been , and ever will continue , betwixt the favourers of the two poets . Non nostrum est tantas componere lites . I shall only venture to give my own opinion , and leave it for better judges to determine . If it be only argued in general , which of them was the better poet , the victory is already gained on the side of Horace . Virgil himself must yield to him in the delicacy of his turns , his choice of words , and perhaps the purity of his Latin . He who says that Pindar is inimitable , is himself inimitable in his Odes . But the contention betwixt these two great masters , is for the prize of Satire ; in which controversy , all the Odes and Epodes of Horace are to stand excluded . I say this , because Horace has written many of them satyrically , against his private enemies ; yet these , if justly considered , are somewhat of the nature of the Greek Silli , which were invectives against particular sects and persons . But Horace has purged himself of this choler , before he entered on those discourses , which are more properly called the Roman Satire . He has not now to do with a Lyce , a Canidia , a Cassius Severus , or a Menas ; but is to correct the vices and the follies of his time , and to give the rules of a happy and virtuous life . In a word , that former sort of satire , which is known in England by the name of lampoon , is a dangerous sort of weapon , and for the most part unlawful . We have no moral right on the reputation of other men . It is taking from them what we cannot restore to them . There are only two reasons , for which we may be permitted to write lampoons ; and I will not promise that they can always justify us . The first is revenge , when we have been affronted in the same nature , or have been any ways notoriously abused , and can make ourselves no other reparation . And yet we know , that , in christian charity , all offences are to be forgiven , as we expect the like pardon for those which we daily commit against Almighty God . And this consideration has often made me tremble when I was saying our Saviour 's prayer ; for the plain condition of the forgiveness which we beg , is the pardoning of others the offences which they have done to us ; for which reason I have many times avoided the commission of that fault , even when I have been notoriously provoked . Let not this , my lord , pass for vanity in me ; for it is truth . More libels have been written against me , than almost any man now living ; and I had reason on my side , to have defended my own innocence . I speak not of my poetry , which I have wholly given up to the critics : let them use it as they please : posterity , perhaps , may be more favourable to me ; for interest and passion will lie buried in another age , and partiality and prejudice be forgotten . I speak of my morals , which have been sufficiently aspersed : that only sort of reputation ought to be dear to every honest man , and is to me . But let the world witness for me , that I have been often wanting to myself in that particular ; I have seldom answered any scurrilous lampoon , when it was in my power to have exposed my enemies : and , being naturally vindicative , have suffered in silence , and possessed my soul in quiet .</p>
   <p>Any thing , though never so little , which a man speaks of himself , in my opinion , is still too much ; and therefore I will wave this subject , and proceed to give the second reason which may justify a poet when he writes against a particular person ; and that is , when he is become a public nuisance . All those , whom Horace in his Satires , and Persius and Juvenal have mentioned in theirs , with a brand of infamy , are wholly such . It is an action of virtue to make examples of vicious men . They may and ought to be upbraided with their crimes and follies ; both for their amendment , if they are not yet incorrigible , and for the terror of others , to hinder them from falling into those enormities , which they see are so severely punished in the persons of others . The first reason was only an excuse for revenge ; but this second is absolutely of a poet 's office to perform : but how few lampooners are now living , who are capable of this duty !<span type="note_anchor">[ 36 ]</span>When they come in my way , it is impossible sometimes to avoid reading them . But , good God ! how remote they are , in common justice , from the choice of such persons as are the proper subject of satire ! And how little wit they bring for the support of their injustice ! The weaker sex is their most ordinary theme ; and the best and fairest are sure to be the most severely handled . Amongst men , those who are prosperously unjust , are entitled to panegyric ; but afflicted virtue is insolently stabbed with all manner of reproaches ; no decency is considered , no fulsomeness omitted ; no venom is wanting , as far as dulness can supply it : for there is a perpetual dearth of wit ; a barrenness of good sense and entertainment . The neglect of the readers will soon put an end to this sort of scribbling . There can be no pleasantry where there is no wit ; no impression can be made , where there is no truth for the foundation . To conclude : they are like the fruits of the earth in this unnatural season ; the corn which held up its head is spoiled with rankness ; but the greater part of the harvest is laid along , and little of good income and wholesome nourishment is received into the barns . This is almost a digression , I confess to your lordship ; but a just indignation forced it from me . Now I have removed this rubbish , I will return to the comparison of Juvenal and Horace .</p>
   <p>I would willingly divide the palm betwixt them , upon the two heads of profit and delight , which are the two ends of poetry in general . It must be granted , by the favourers of Juvenal , that Horace is the more copious and profitable in his instructions of human life ; but , in my particular opinion , which I set not up for a standard to better judgements , Juvenal is the more delightful author . I am profited by both , I am pleased with both ; but I owe more to Horace for my instruction , and more to Juvenal for my pleasure . This , as I said , is my particular taste of these two authors : they who will have either of them to excel the other in both qualities , can scarce give better reasons for their opinion than I for mine . But all unbiassed readers will conclude , that my moderation is not to be condemned : to such impartial men I must appeal ; for they who have already formed their judgment , may justly stand suspected of prejudice ; and though all who are my readers will set up to be my judges , I enter my caveat against them , that they ought not so much as to be of my jury ; or , if they be admitted , it is but reason that they should first hear what I have to urge in the defence of my opinion .</p>
   <p>That Horace is somewhat the better instructor of the two , is proved from hence ,— that his instructions are more general , Juvenal 's more limited . So that , granting that the counsels which they give are equally good for moral use , Horace , who gives the most various advice , and most applicable to all occasions which can occur to us in the course of our lives ,— as including in his discourses , not only all the rules of morality , but also of civil conversation ,— is undoubtedly to be preferred to him who is more circumscribed in his instructions , makes them to fewer people , and on fewer occasions , than the other . I may be pardoned for using an old saying , since it is true , and to the purpose : Bonum quò communis , eò melius . Juvenal , excepting only his first Satire , is in all the rest confined to the exposing of some particular vice ; that he lashes , and there he sticks . His sentences are truly shining and instructive ; but they are sprinkled here and there . Horace is teaching us in every line , and is perpetually moral : he had found out the skill of Virgil , to hide his sentences ; to give you the virtue of them , without shewing them in their full extent ; which is the ostentation of a poet , and not his art : and this Petronius charges on the authors of his time , as a vice of writing which was then growing on the age : ne sententiæ extra corpus orationis emineant : he would have them weaved into the body of the work , and not appear embossed upon it , and striking directly on the reader 's view . Folly was the proper quarry of Horace , and not vice ; and as there are but few notoriously wicked men , in comparison with a shoal of fools and fops , so it is a harder thing to make a man wise than to make him honest ; for the will is only to be reclaimed in the one , but the understanding is to be informed in the other . There are blind sides and follies , even in the professors of moral philosophy ; and there is not any one sect of them that Horace has not exposed : which , as it was not the design of Juvenal , who was wholly employed in lashing vices , some of them the most enormous that can be imagined , so , perhaps , it was not so much his talent .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Omne vafer vitium ridenti Flaccus amico</l>
     <l n="2">Tangit , et admissus circum præcordia ludit .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>This was the commendation which Persius gave him : where , by vitium , he means those little vices which we call follies , the defects of human understanding , or , at most , the peccadillos of life , rather than the tragical vices , to which men are hurried by their unruly passions and exorbitant desires . But , in the word omne , which is universal , he concludes with me , that the divine wit of Horace left nothing untouched ; that he entered into the inmost recesses of nature ; found out the imperfections even of the most wise and grave , as well as of the common people ; discovering , even in the great Trebatius , to whom he addresses the first Satire , his hunting after business , and following the court , as well as in the persecutor Crispinus , his impertinence and importunity . It is true , he exposes Crispinus openly , as a common nuisance ; but he rallies the other , as a friend , more finely . The exhortations of Persius are confined to noblemen ; and the stoick philosophy is that alone which he recommends to them ; Juvenal exhorts to particular virtues , as they are opposed to those vices against which he declaims ; but Horace laughs to shame all follies , and insinuates virtue , rather by familiar examples than by the severity of precepts .</p>
   <p>This last consideration seems to incline the balance on the side of Horace , and to give him the preference to Juvenal , not only in profit , but in pleasure . But , after all , I must confess , that the delight which Horace gives me is but languishing . Be pleased still to understand , that I speak of my own taste only : he may ravish other men ; but I am too stupid and insensible to be tickled . Where he barely grins himself , and , as Scaliger says , only shows his white teeth , he cannot provoke me to any laughter . His urbanity , that is , his good manners , are to be commended , but his wit is faint ; and his salt , if I may dare to say so , almost insipid . Juvenal is of a more vigorous and masculine wit ; he gives me as much pleasure as I can bear ; he fully satisfies my expectation ; he treats his subject home : his spleen is raised , and he raises mine : I have the pleasure of concernment in all he says ; he drives his reader along with him ; and when he is at the end of his way , I willingly stop with him . If he went another stage , it would be too far ; it would make a journey of a progress , and turn delight into fatigue . When he gives over , it is a sign the subject is exhausted , and the wit of man can carry it no farther . If a fault can be justly found in him , it is , that he is sometimes too luxuriant , too redundant ; says more than he needs , like my friend the Plain-Dealer ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 37 ]</span>but never more than pleases . Add to this , that his thoughts are as just as those of Horace , and much more elevated . His expressions are sonorous and more noble ; his verse more numerous , and his words are suitable to his thoughts , sublime and lofty . All these contribute to the pleasure of the reader ; and the greater the soul of him who reads , his transports are the greater . Horace is always on the amble , Juvenal on the gallop ; but his way is perpetually on carpet-ground . He goes with more impetuosity than Horace , but as securely ; and the swiftness adds a more lively agitation to the spirits . The low style of Horace is according to his subject , that is , generally grovelling . I question not but he could have raised it ; for the first epistle of the second book , which he writes to Augustus , ( a most instructive satire concerning poetry ,) is of so much dignity in the words , and of so much elegancy in the numbers , that the author plainly shows , the sermo pedestris , in his other Satires , was rather his choice than his necessity . He was a rival to Lucilius , his predecessor , and was resolved to surpass him in his own manner . Lucilius , as we see by his remaining fragments , minded neither his style , nor his numbers , nor his purity of words , nor his run of verse . Horace therefore copes with him in that humble way of satire , writes under his own force , and carries a dead-weight , that he may match his competitor in the race . This , I imagine , was the chief reason why he minded only the clearness of his satire , and the cleanness of expression , without ascending to those heights to which his own vigour might have carried him . But , limiting his desires only to the conquest of Lucilius , he had his ends of his rival , who lived before him ; but made way for a new conquest over himself , by Juvenal , his successor . He could not give an equal pleasure to his reader , because he used not equal instruments . The fault was in the tools , and not in the workman . But versification and numbers are the greatest pleasures of poetry : Virgil knew it , and practised both so happily , that , for aught I know , his greatest excellency is in his diction . In all other parts of poetry , he is faultless ; but in this he placed his chief perfection . And give me leave , my lord , since I have here an apt occasion , to say , that Virgil could have written sharper satires than either Horace or Juvenal , if he would have employed his talent that way . I will produce a verse and half of his , in one of his Eclogues , to justify my opinion ; and with commas after every word , to show , that he has given almost as many lashes as he has written syllables : it is against a bad poet , whose ill verses he describes :</p>
   <p>—— non tu , in triviis , indocte , solebas Stridenti , miserum , stipulâ , disperdere carmen ?</p>
   <p>But , to return to my purpose . When there is any thing deficient in numbers and sound , the reader is uneasy and unsatisfied ; he wants something of his complement , desires somewhat which he finds not : and this being the manifest defect of Horace , it is no wonder that , finding it supplied in Juvenal , we are more delighted with him . And , besides this , the sauce of Juvenal is more poignant , to create in us an appetite of reading him . The meat of Horace is more nourishing ; but the cookery of Juvenal more exquisite : so that , granting Horace to be the more general philosopher , we cannot deny that Juvenal was the greater poet , I mean in satire . His thoughts are sharper ; his indignation against vice is more vehement ; his spirit has more of the commonwealth genius ; he treats tyranny , and all the vices attending it , as they deserve , with the utmost rigour : and consequently , a noble soul is better pleased with a zealous vindicator of Roman liberty , than with a temporising poet , a well-mannered court-slave , and a man who is often afraid of laughing in the right place ; who is ever decent , because he is naturally servile . After all , Horace had the disadvantage of the times in which he lived ; they were better for the man , but worse for the satirist . It is generally said , that those enormous vices which were practised under the reign of Domitian , were unknown in the time of Augustus Cæsar ; that therefore Juvenal had a larger field than Horace . Little follies were out of doors , when oppression was to be scourged instead of avarice : it was no longer time to turn into ridicule the false opinions of philosophers , when the Roman liberty was to be asserted . There was more need of a Brutus in Domitian 's days , to redeem or mend , than of a Horace , if he had then been living , to laugh at a fly-catcher .<span type="note_anchor">[ 38 ]</span>This reflection at the same time excuses Horace , but exalts Juvenal .— I have ended , before I was aware , the comparison of Horace and Juvenal , upon the topics of instruction and delight ; and , indeed , I may safely here conclude that common-place ; for , if we make Horace our minister of state in satire , and Juvenal of our private pleasures , I think the latter has no ill bargain of it . Let profit have the pre-eminence of honour , in the end of poetry . Pleasure , though but the second in degree , is the first in favour . And who would not chuse to be loved better , rather than to be more esteemed ? But I am entered already upon another topic , which concerns the particular merits of these two satirists . However , I will pursue my business where I left it , and carry it farther than that common observation of the several ages in which these authors flourished .</p>
   <p>When Horace writ his Satires , the monarchy of his Cæsar was in its newness , and the government but just made easy to the conquered people . They could not possibly have forgotten the usurpation of that prince upon their freedom , nor the violent methods which he had used , in the compassing that vast design : they yet remembered his proscriptions , and the slaughter of so many noble Romans , their defenders : amongst the rest , that horrible action of his , when he forced Livia from the arms of her husband , who was constrained to see her married , as Dion relates the story , and , big with child as she was , conveyed to the bed of his insulting rival . The same Dion Cassius gives us another instance of the crime before mentioned ; that Cornelius Sisenna being reproached , in full senate , with the licentious conduct of his wife , returned this answer , “ that he had married her by the counsel of Augustus ; ” intimating , says my author , that Augustus had obliged him to that marriage , that he might , under that covert , have the more free access to her . His adulteries were still before their eyes : but they must be patient where they had not power . In other things that emperor was moderate enough : propriety was generally secured ; and the people entertained with public shows and donatives , to make them more easily digest their lost liberty . But Augustus , who was conscious to himself of so many crimes which he had committed , thought , in the first place , to provide for his own reputation , by making an edict against Lampoons and Satires , and the authors of those defamatory writings , which my author Tacitus , from the law-term , calls famosos libellos .</p>
   <p>In the first book of his Annals , he gives the following account of it , in these words : Primus Augustus cognitionem de famosis libellis , specie legis ejus , tractavit ; commotus Cassii Severi libidine , quâ viros fæminasque illustres , procacibus scriptis diffamaverat . Thus in English : “ Augustus was the first , who under the colour of that law took cognisance of lampoons ; being provoked to it , by the petulancy of Cassius Severus , who had defamed many illustrious persons of both sexes , in his writings . ” The law to which Tacitus refers , was Lex læsæ Majestatis ; commonly called , for the sake of brevity , Majestas ; or , as we say , high treason . He means not , that this law had not been enacted formerly : for it had been made by the Decemviri , and was inscribed amongst the rest in the Twelve Tables ; to prevent the aspersion of the Roman majesty , either of the people themselves , or their religion , or their magistrates : and the infringement of it was capital ; that is , the offender was whipt to death , with the fasces , which were borne before their chief officers of Rome . But Augustus was the first , who restored that intermitted law . By the words , under colour of that law , he insinuates that Augustus caused it to be executed , on pretence of those libels , which were written by Cassius Severus , against the nobility ; but , in truth , to save himself from such defamatory verses . Suetonius likewise makes mention of it thus : Sparsos de se in curiâ famosos libellos , nec expavit , et magnâ curâ redarguit . Ac ne requisitis quidem auctoribus , id modo censuit , cognoscendum posthac de iis qui libellos aut carmina ad infamiam cujuspiam sub alieno nomine edant . “ Augustus was not afraid of libels , ” says that author ; “ yet he took all care imaginable to have them answered ; and then decreed , that for the time to come , the authors of them should be punished . ” But Aurelius makes it yet more clear , according to my sense , that this emperor for his own sake durst not permit them : Fecit id Augustus in speciem , et quasi gratificaretur populo Romano , et primoribus urbis ; sed revera ut sibi consuleret : nam habuit in animo , comprimere nimiam quorundam procacitatem in loquendo , à quâ nec ipse exemptus fuit . Nam suo nomine compescere erat invidiosum , sub alieno facile et utile . Ergo specie legis tractavit , quasi populi Romani majestas infamaretur . This , I think , is a sufficient comment on that passage of Tacitus . I will add only by the way , that the whole family of the Cæsars , and all their relations , were included in the law ; because the majesty of the Romans , in the time of the empire , was wholly in that house ; omnia Cæsar erat : they were all accounted sacred who belonged to him . As for Cassius Severus , he was contemporary with Horace ; and was the same poet against whom he writes in his Epodes , under this title , In Cassium Severum maledicum poetam ; perhaps intending to kill two crows , according to our proverb , with one stone , and revenge both himself and his emperor together .</p>
   <p>From hence I may reasonably conclude , that Augustus , who was not altogether so good as he was wise , had some by-respect in the enacting of this law ; for to do any thing for nothing , was not his maxim . Horace , as he was a courtier , complied with the interest of his master ; and , avoiding the lashing of greater crimes , confined himself to the ridiculing of petty vices and common follies ; excepting only some reserved cases , in his Odes and Epodes , of his own particular quarrels , which either with permission of the magistrate , or without it , every man will revenge , though I say not that he should ; for prior læsit is a good excuse in the civil law , if christianity had not taught us to forgive . However , he was not the proper man to arraign great vices , at least if the stories which we hear of him are true ,— that he practised some , which I will not here mention , out of honour to him . It was not for a Clodius to accuse adulterers , especially when Augustus was of that number ; so that though his age was not exempted from the worst of villanies , there was no freedom left to reprehend them by reason of the edict ; and our poet was not fit to represent them in an odious character , because himself was dipt in the same actions . Upon this account , without farther insisting on the different tempers of Juvenal and Horace , I conclude , that the subjects which Horace chose for satire , are of a lower nature than those of which Juvenal has written .</p>
   <p>Thus I have treated , in a new method , the comparison betwixt Horace , Juvenal , and Persius ; somewhat of their particular manner belonging to all of them is yet remaining to be considered . Persius was grave , and particularly opposed his gravity to lewdness , which was the predominant vice in Nero 's court , at the time when he published his Satires , which was before that emperor fell into the excess of cruelty . Horace was a mild admonisher , a court-satirist , fit for the gentle times of Augustus , and more fit , for the reasons which I have already given . Juvenal was as proper for his times , as they for theirs ; his was an age that deserved a more severe chastisement ; vices were more gross and open , more flagitious , more encouraged by the example of a tyrant , and more protected by his authority . Therefore , wheresoever Juvenal mentions Nero , he means Domitian , whom he dares not attack in his own person , but scourges him by proxy . Heinsius urges in praise of Horace , that , according to the ancient art and law of satire , it should be nearer to comedy than tragedy ; not declaiming against vice , but only laughing at it . Neither Persius nor Juvenal were ignorant of this , for they had both studied Horace . And the thing itself is plainly true . But as they had read Horace , they had likewise read Lucilius , of whom Persius says ,— secuit urbem ; ... et genuinum fregit in illis ; meaning Mutius and Lupus ; and Juvenal also mentions him in these words :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Ense velut stricto , quoties Lucilius ardens</l>
     <l n="2">Infremuit , rubet auditor , cui frigida mens est</l>
     <l n="3">Criminibus , tacitâ sudant præcordia culpa .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>So that they thought the imitation of Lucilius was more proper to their purpose than that of Horace . “ They changed satire , ( says Holyday ) but they changed it for the better ; for the business being to reform great vices , chastisement goes farther than admonition ; whereas a perpetual grin , like that of Horace , does rather anger than amend a man . ”</p>
   <p>Thus far that learned critic , Barten Holyday ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 39 ]</span>whose interpretation and illustrations of Juvenal are as excellent , as the verse of his translation and his English are lame and pitiful . For it is not enough to give us the meaning of a poet , which I acknowledge him to have performed most faithfully , but he must also imitate his genius , and his numbers , as far as the English will come up to the elegance of the original . In few words , it is only for a poet to translate a poem . Holyday and Stapylton<span type="note_anchor">[ 40 ]</span>had not enough considered this , when they attempted Juvenal : but I forbear reflections ; only I beg leave to take notice of this sentence , where Holyday says , “ a perpetual grin , like that of Horace , rather angers than amends a man . ” I cannot give him up the manner of Horace in low satire so easily . Let the chastisement of Juvenal be never so necessary for his new kind of satire ; let him declaim as wittily and sharply as he pleases ; yet still the nicest and most delicate touches of satire consist in fine raillery . This , my lord , is your particular talent , to which even Juvenal could not arrive . It is not reading , it is not imitation of an author , which can produce this fineness ; it must be inborn ; it must proceed from a genius , and particular way of thinking , which is not to be taught ; and therefore not to be imitated by him who has it not from nature . How easy is it to call rogue and villain , and that wittily ! But how hard to make a man appear a fool , a blockhead , or a knave , without using any of those opprobrious terms ! To spare the grossness of the names , and to do the thing yet more severely , is to draw a full face , and to make the nose and cheeks stand out , and yet not to employ any depth of shadowing . This is the mystery of that noble trade , which yet no master can teach to his apprentice ; he may give the rules , but the scholar is never the nearer in his practice . Neither is it true , that this fineness of raillery is offensive . A witty man is tickled while he is hurt in this manner , and a fool feels it not . The occasion of an offence may possibly be given , but he cannot take it . If it be granted , that in effect this way does more mischief ; that a man is secretly wounded , and though he be not sensible himself , yet the malicious world will find it out for him ; yet there is still a vast difference betwixt the slovenly butchering of a man , and the fineness of a stroke that separates the head from the body , and leaves it standing in its place . A man may be capable , as Jack Ketch 's<span type="note_anchor">[ 41 ]</span>wife said of his servant , of a plain piece of work , a bare hanging ; but to make a malefactor die sweetly , was only belonging to her husband . I wish I could apply it to myself , if the reader would be kind enough to think it belongs to me . The character of Zimri in my “ Absalom , ” is , in my opinion , worth the whole poem : it is not bloody , but it is ridiculous enough ; and he , for whom it was intended , was too witty to resent it as an injury .<span type="note_anchor">[ 42 ]</span>If I had railed , I might have suffered for it justly ; but I managed my own work more happily , perhaps more dexterously . I avoided the mention of great crimes , and applied myself to the representing of blind-sides , and little extravagancies ; to which , the wittier a man is , he is generally the more obnoxious . It succeeded as I wished ; the jest went round , and he was laughed at in his turn who began the frolic .</p>
   <p>And thus , my lord , you see I have preferred the manner of Horace , and of your lordship , in this kind of satire , to that of Juvenal , and I think , reasonably . Holyday ought not to have arraigned so great an author , for that which was his excellency and his merit : or if he did , on such a palpable mistake , he might expect that some one might possibly arise , either in his own time , or after him , to rectify his error , and restore to Horace that commendation , of which he has so unjustly robbed him . And let the manes of Juvenal forgive me , if I say , that this way of Horace was the best for amending manners , as it is the most difficult . His was an ense rescindendum ; but that of Horace was a pleasant cure , with all the limbs preserved entire ; and , as our mountebanks tell us in their bills , without keeping the patient within doors for a day . What they promise only , Horace has effectually performed : yet I contradict not the proposition which I formerly advanced . Juvenal 's times required a more painful kind of operation ; but if he had lived in the age of Horace , I must needs affirm , that he had it not about him . He took the method which was prescribed him by his own genius , which was sharp and eager ; he could not rally , but he could declaim ; and as his provocations were great , he has revenged them tragically . This notwithstanding , I am to say another word , which , as true as it is , will yet displease the partial admirers of our Horace . I have hinted it before , but it is time for me now to speak more plainly .</p>
   <p>This manner of Horace is indeed the best ; but Horace has not executed it altogether so happily , at least not often . The manner of Juvenal is confessed to be inferior to the former , but Juvenal has excelled him in his performance . Juvenal has railed more wittily than Horace has rallied . Horace means to make his readers laugh , but he is not sure of his experiment . Juvenal always intends to move your indignation , and he always brings about his purpose . Horace , for aught I know , might have tickled the people of his age ; but amongst the moderns he is not so successful . They , who say he entertains so pleasantly , may perhaps value themselves on the quickness of their own understandings , that they can see a jest farther off than other men ; they may find occasion of laughter in the wit-battle of the two buffoons , Sarmentus and Cicerrus ; and hold their sides for fear of bursting , when Rupilius and Persius are scolding . For my own part , I can only like the characters of all four , which are judiciously given ; but for my heart I cannot so much as smile at their insipid raillery . I see not why Persius should call upon Brutus to revenge him on his adversary ; and that because he had killed Julius Cæsar , for endeavouring to be a king , therefore he should be desired to murder Rupilius , only because his name was Mr King .<span type="note_anchor">[ 43 ]</span>A miserable clench , in my opinion , for Horace to record : I have heard honest Mr Swan<span type="note_anchor">[ 44 ]</span>make many a better , and yet have had the grace to hold my countenance . But it may be puns were then in fashion , as they were wit in the sermons of the last age , and in the court of King Charles II . I am sorry to say it , for the sake of Horace ; but certain it is , he has no fine palate who can feed so heartily on garbage .</p>
   <p>But I have already wearied myself , and doubt not but I have tired your lordship 's patience , with this long , rambling , and , I fear , trivial discourse . Upon the one half of the merits , that is , pleasure , I cannot but conclude that Juvenal was the better satirist . They , who will descend into his particular praises , may find them at large in the Dissertation of the learned Rigaltius to Thuanus . As for Persius , I have given the reasons why I think him inferior to both of them ; yet I have one thing to add on that subject .</p>
   <p>Barten Holyday , who translated both Juvenal and Persius , has made this distinction betwixt them , which is no less true than witty ,— that in Persius the difficulty is to find a meaning , in Juvenal to chuse a meaning : so crabbed is Persius , and so copious is Juvenal ; so much the understanding is employed in one , and so much the judgment in the other ; so difficult it is to find any sense in the former , and the best sense of the latter .</p>
   <p>If , on the other side , any one suppose I have commended Horace below his merit , when I have allowed him but the second place , I desire him to consider , if Juvenal , a man of excellent natural endowments , besides the advantages of diligence and study , and coming after him , and building upon his foundations , might not probably , with all these helps , surpass him ; and whether it be any dishonour to Horace to be thus surpassed , since no art or science is at once begun and perfected , but that it must pass first through many hands , and even through several ages . If Lucilius could add to Ennius , and Horace to Lucilius , why , without any diminution to the fame of Horace , might not Juvenal give the last perfection to that work ? Or , rather , what disreputation is it to Horace , that Juvenal excels in the tragical satire , as Horace does in the comical ? I have read over attentively both Heinsius and Dacier , in their commendations of Horace ; but I can find no more in either of them , for the preference of him to Juvenal , than the instructive part ; the part of wisdom , and not that of pleasure ; which , therefore , is here allowed him , notwithstanding what Scaliger and Rigaltius have pleaded to the contrary for Juvenal . And , to show that I am impartial , I will here translate what Dacier has said on that subject .</p>
   <p>“ I cannot give a more just idea of the two books of Satires made by Horace , than by comparing them to the statues of the Sileni , to which Alcibiades compares Socrates in the Symposium . They were figures , which had nothing of agreeable , nothing of beauty , on their outside ; but when any one took the pains to open them , and search into them , he there found the figures of all the deities . So , in the shape that Horace presents himself to us in his Satires , we see nothing , at the first view , which deserves our attention : it seems that he is rather an amusement for children , than for the serious consideration of men . But , when we take away his crust , and that which hides him from our sight , when we discover him to the bottom , then we find all the divinities in a full assembly ; that is to say , all the virtues which ought to be the continual exercise of those , who seriously endeavour to correct their vices . ”</p>
   <p>It is easy to observe , that Dacier , in this noble similitude , has confined the praise of his author wholly to the instructive part ; the commendation turns on this , and so does that which follows .</p>
   <p>“ In these two books of satire , it is the business of Horace to instruct us how to combat our vices , to regulate our passions , to follow nature , to give bounds to our desires , to distinguish betwixt truth and falsehood , and betwixt our conceptions of things , and things themselves ; to come back from our prejudicate opinions , to understand exactly the principles and motives of all our actions ; and to avoid the ridicule , into which all men necessarily fall , who are intoxicated with those notions which they have received from their masters , and which they obstinately retain , without examining whether or no they be founded on right reason .</p>
   <p>“ In a word , he labours to render us happy in relation to ourselves ; agreeable and faithful to our friends ; and discreet , serviceable , and well-bred , in relation to those with whom we are obliged to live , and to converse . To make his figures intelligible , to conduct his readers through the labyrinth of some perplexed sentence , or obscure parenthesis , is no great matter ; and , as Epictetus says , there is nothing of beauty in all this , or what is worthy of a prudent man . The principal business , and which is of most importance to us , is to show the use , the reason , and the proof of his precepts .</p>
   <p>“ They who endeavour not to correct themselves , according to so exact a model , are just like the patients who have open before them a book of admirable receipts for their diseases , and please themselves with reading it , without comprehending the nature of the remedies , or how to apply them to their cure . ”</p>
   <p>Let Horace go off with these encomiums , which he has so well deserved .</p>
   <p>To conclude the contention betwixt our three poets , I will use the words of Virgil , in his fifth Æneid , where Æneas proposes the rewards of the foot-race to the three first who should reach the goal .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">—— Tres præmia primi</l>
     <l n="2">Accipient , flavâque caput nectentur olivâ .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Let these three ancients be preferred to all the moderns , as first arriving at the goal ; let them all be crowned , as victors , with the wreath that properly belongs to satire ; but , after that , with this distinction amongst themselves ,</p>
   <p>Primus equum phaleris insignem victor habeto .</p>
   <p>Let Juvenal ride first in triumph ;</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Alter Amazoniam pharetram , plenamque sagittis</l>
     <l n="2">Threiciis , lato quam circumplectitur auro</l>
     <l n="3">Balteus , et tereti subnectit fibula gemmâ .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Let Horace , who is the second , and but just the second , carry off the quivers and the arrows , as the badges of his satire , and the golden belt , and the diamond button ;</p>
   <p>Tertius Argolico hoc clypeo contentus abito .</p>
   <p>And let Persius , the last of the first three worthies , be contented with this Grecian shield , and with victory , not only over all the Grecians , who were ignorant of the Roman satire , but over all the moderns in succeeding ages , excepting Boileau and your lordship .</p>
   <p>And thus I have given the history of Satire , and derived it as far as from Ennius to your lordship ; that is , from its first rudiments of barbarity to its last polishing and perfection ; which is , with Virgil , in his address to Augustus ,—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">—— Nomen famâ tot ferre per annos ,</l>
     <l n="2">Tithoni primâ quot abest ab origine Cæsar .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I said only from Ennius ; but I may safely carry it higher , as far as Livius Andronicus , who , as I have said formerly , taught the first play at Rome , in the year ab urbe condita CCCCCXIV . I have since desired my learned friend , Mr Maidwell ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 45 ]</span>to compute the difference of times , betwixt Aristophanes and Livius Andronicus ; and he assures me , from the best chronologers , that “ Plutus , ” the last of Aristophanes 's plays , was represented at Athens , in the year of the 97th Olympiad ; which agrees with the year urbis conditæ CCCLXIV . So that the difference of years betwixt Aristophanes and Andronicus is 150 ; from whence I have probably deduced , that Livius Andronicus , who was a Grecian , had read the plays of the old comedy , which were satirical , and also of the new ; for Menander was fifty years before him , which must needs be a great light to him in his own plays , that were of the satirical nature . That the Romans had farces before this it is true ; but then they had no communication with Greece ; so that Andronicus was the first who wrote after the manner of the old comedy in his plays : he was imitated by Ennius , about thirty years afterwards . Though the former writ fables , the latter , speaking properly , began the Roman satire ; according to that description , which Juvenal gives of it in his first :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Quicquid agunt homines , votum , timor , ira , voluptas ,</l>
     <l n="2">Gaudia , discursus , nostri est farrago libelli .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>This is that in which I have made bold to differ from Casaubon , Rigaltius , Dacier , and indeed from all the modern critics ,— that not Ennius , but Andronicus was the first , who , by the Archæa Comoedia of the Greeks , added many beauties to the first rude and barbarous Roman satire : which sort of poem , though we had not derived from Rome , yet nature teaches it mankind in all ages , and in every country .</p>
   <p>It is but necessary , that after so much has been said of Satire , some definition of it should be given . Heinsius , in his “ Dissertations on Horace , ” makes it for me , in these words : “ Satire is a kind of poetry , without a series of action , invented for the purging of our minds ; in which human vices , ignorance , and errors , and all things besides , which are produced from them in every man , are severely reprehended ; partly dramatically , partly simply , and sometimes in both kinds of speaking ; but , for the most part , figuratively , and occultly ; consisting in a low familiar way , chiefly in a sharp and pungent manner of speech ; but partly , also , in a facetious and civil way of jesting ; by which either hatred , or laughter , or indignation , is moved . ” — Where I cannot but observe , that this obscure and perplexed definition , or rather description , of satire , is wholly accommodated to the Horatian way ; and excluding the works of Juvenal and Persius , as foreign from that kind of poem . The clause in the beginning of it ( “ without a series of action ” ) distinguishes satire properly from stage-plays , which are all of one action , and one continued series of action . The end or scope of satire is to purge the passions ; so far it is common to the satires of Juvenal and Persius . The rest which follows is also generally belonging to all three ; till he comes upon us , with the excluding clause — “ consisting in a low familiar way of speech , ” — which is the proper character of Horace ; and from which , the other two , for their honour be it spoken , are far distant . But how come lowness of style , and the familiarity of words , to be so much the propriety of satire , that without them a poet can be no more a satirist , than without risibility he can be a man ? Is the fault of Horace to be made the virtue and standing rule of this poem ? Is the grande sophos<span type="note_anchor">[ 46 ]</span>of Persius , and the sublimity of Juvenal , to be circumscribed with the meanness of words and vulgarity of expression ? If Horace refused the pains of numbers , and the loftiness of figures , are they bound to follow so ill a precedent ? Let him walk a-foot , with his pad in his hand , for his own pleasure ; but let not them be accounted no poets , who chuse to mount , and show their horsemanship . Holyday is not afraid to say , that there was never such a fall , as from his Odes to his Satires , and that he , injuriously to himself , untuned his harp . The majestic way of Persius and Juvenal was new when they began it , but it is old to us ; and what poems have not , with time , received an alteration in their fashion ? “ which alteration , ” says Holyday , “ is to after times as good a warrant as the first . ” Has not Virgil changed the manners of Homer 's heroes in his Æneid ? Certainly he has , and for the better : for Virgil 's age was more civilized , and better bred ; and he writ according to the politeness of Rome , under the reign of Augustus Cæsar , not to the rudeness of Agamemnon 's age , or the times of Homer . Why should we offer to confine free spirits to one form , when we cannot so much as confine our bodies to one fashion of apparel ? Would not Donne 's satires , which abound with so much wit , appear more charming , if he had taken care of his words , and of his numbers ? But he followed Horace so very close , that of necessity he must fall with him ; and I may safely say it of this present age , that if we are not so great wits as Donne , yet , certainly , we are better poets .</p>
   <p>But I have said enough , and it may be too much , on this subject . Will your lordship be pleased to prolong my audience , only so far , till I tell you my own trivial thoughts , how a modern satire should be made . I will not deviate in the least from the precepts and examples of the ancients , who were always our best masters . I will only illustrate them , and discover some of the hidden beauties in their designs , that we thereby may form our own in imitation of them . Will you please but to observe , that Persius , the least in dignity of all the three , has notwithstanding been the first , who has discovered to us this important secret , in the designing of a perfect satire ,— that it ought only to treat of one subject ;— to be confined to one particular theme ; or , at least , to one principally . If other vices occur in the management of the chief , they should only be transiently lashed , and not be insisted on , so as to make the design double . As in a play of the English fashion , which we call a tragi-comedy , there is to be but one main design ; and though there be an underplot , or second walk of comical characters and adventures , yet they are subservient to the chief fable , carried along under it , and helping to it ; so that the drama may not seem a monster with two heads . Thus , the Copernican system of the planets makes the moon to be moved by the motion of the earth , and carried about her orb , as a dependent of her 's . Mascardi , in his discourse of the Doppia favola , or double tale in plays , gives an instance of it in the famous pastoral of Guarini , called Il Pastor Fido ; where Corisca and the Satyr are the under parts ; yet we may observe , that Corisca is brought into the body of the plot , and made subservient to it . It is certain , that the divine wit of Horace was not ignorant of this rule ,— that a play , though it consists of many parts , must yet be one in the action , and must drive on the accomplishment of one design ; for he gives this very precept ,— Sit quodvis simplex duntaxat et unum ; yet he seems not much to mind it in his Satires , many of them consisting of more arguments than one ; and the second without dependence on the first . Casaubon has observed this before me , in his preference of Persius to Horace ; and will have his own beloved author to be the first who found out and introduced this method of confining himself to one subject . I know it may be urged in defence of Horace , that this unity is not necessary ; because the very word satura signifies a dish plentifully stored with all variety of fruit and grains . Yet Juvenal , who calls his poems a farrago , which is a word of the same signification with satura , has chosen to follow the same method of Persius , and not of Horace ; and Boileau , whose example alone is a sufficient authority , has wholly confined himself , in all his satires , to this unity of design . That variety , which is not to be found in any one satire , is , at least , in many , written on several occasions . And if variety be of absolute necessity in every one of them , according to the etymology of the word , yet it may arise naturally from one subject , as it is diversely treated , in the several subordinate branches of it , all relating to the chief . It may be illustrated accordingly with variety of examples in the subdivisions of it , and with as many precepts as there are members of it ; which , altogether , may complete that olla , or hotchpotch , which is properly a satire .</p>
   <p>Under this unity of theme , or subject , is comprehended another rule for perfecting the design of true satire . The poet is bound , and that ex officio , to give his reader some one precept of moral virtue , and to caution him against some one particular vice or folly . Other virtues , subordinate to the first , may be recommended under that chief head ; and other vices or follies may be scourged , besides that which he principally intends . But he is chiefly to inculcate one virtue , and insist on that . Thus Juvenal , in every satire excepting the first , ties himself to one principal instructive point , or to the shunning of moral evil . Even in the sixth , which seems only an arraignment of the whole sex of womankind , there is a latent admonition to avoid ill women , by showing how very few , who are virtuous and good , are to be found amongst them . But this , though the wittiest of all his satires , has yet the least of truth or instruction in it . He has run himself into his old declamatory way , and almost forgotten that he was now setting up for a moral poet .</p>
   <p>Persius is never wanting to us in some profitable doctrine , and in exposing the opposite vices to it . His kind of philosophy is one , which is the stoick ; and every satire is a comment on one particular dogma of that sect , unless we will except the first , which is against bad writers ; and yet even there he forgets not the precepts of the Porch . In general , all virtues are every where to be praised and recommended to practice ; and all vices to be reprehended , and made either odious or ridiculous ; or else there is a fundamental error in the whole design .</p>
   <p>I have already declared who are the only persons that are the adequate object of private satire , and who they are that may properly be exposed by name for public examples of vices and follies ; and therefore I will trouble your lordship no farther with them . Of the best and finest manner of satire , I have said enough in the comparison betwixt Juvenal and Horace : it is that sharp , well-mannered way of laughing a folly out of countenance , of which your lordship is the best master in this age . I will proceed to the versification , which is most proper for it , and add somewhat to what I have said already on that subject . The sort of verse which is called burlesque , consisting of eight syllables , or four feet , is that which our excellent Hudibras has chosen . I ought to have mentioned him before , when I spoke of Donne : but by a slip of an old man 's memory he was forgotten . The worth of his poem is too well known to need my commendation , and he is above my censure . His satire is of the Varronian kind , though unmixed with prose . The choice of his numbers is suitable enough to his design , as he has managed it ; but in any other hand , the shortness of his verse , and the quick returns of rhyme , had debased the dignity of style . And besides , the double rhyme , ( a necessary companion of burlesque writing ,) is not so proper for manly satire ; for it turns earnest too much to jest , and gives us a boyish kind of pleasure . It tickles aukwardly with a kind of pain , to the best sort of readers : we are pleased ungratefully , and , if I may say so , against our liking . We thank him not for giving us that unseasonable delight , when we know he could have given us a better , and more solid . He might have left that task to others , who , not being able to put in thought , can only make us grin with the excrescence of a word of two or three syllables in the close . It is , indeed , below so great a master to make use of such a little instrument .<span type="note_anchor">[ 47 ]</span>But his good sense is perpetually shining through all he writes ; it affords us not the time of finding faults . We pass through the levity of his rhyme , and are immediately carried into some admirable useful thought . After all , he has chosen this kind of verse , and has written the best in it : and had he taken another , he would always have excelled : as we say of a court-favourite , that whatsoever his office be , he still makes it uppermost , and most beneficial to himself .</p>
   <p>The quickness of your imagination , my lord , has already prevented me ; and you know before-hand , that I would prefer the verse of ten syllables , which we call the English heroic , to that of eight . This is truly my opinion ; for this sort of number is more roomy ; the thought can turn itself with greater ease in a larger compass . When the rhyme comes too thick upon us , it straitens the expression ; we are thinking of the close , when we should be employed in adorning the thought . It makes a poet giddy with turning in a space too narrow for his imagination ; he loses many beauties , without gaining one advantage . For a burlesque rhyme I have already concluded to be none ; or , if it were , it is more easily purchased in ten syllables than in eight . In both occasions it is as in a tennis-court , when the strokes of greater force are given , when we strike out and play at length . Tassoni and Boileau have left us the best examples of this way , in the “ Secchia Rapita , ” and the “ Lutrin ; ” and next them Merlin Cocaius in his “ Baldus . ” I will speak only of the two former , because the last is written in Latin verse . The “ Secchia Rapita ” is an Italian poem , a satire of the Varronian kind . It is written in the stanza of eight , which is their measure for heroic verse . The words are stately , the numbers smooth , the turn both of thoughts and words is happy . The first six lines of the stanza seem majestical and severe ; but the two last turn them all into a pleasant ridicule . Boileau , if I am not much deceived , has modelled from hence his famous “ Lutrin . ” He had read the burlesque poetry of Scarron ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 48 ]</span>with some kind of indignation , as witty as it was , and found nothing in France that was worthy of his imitation ; but he copied the Italian so well , that his own may pass for an original . He writes it in the French heroic verse , and calls it an heroic poem ; his subject is trivial , but his verse is noble . I doubt not but he had Virgil in his eye , for we find many admirable imitations of him , and some parodies ; as particularly this passage in the fourth of the Æneids :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Nec tibi diva parens , generis nec Dardanus auctor ,</l>
     <l n="2">Perfide ; sed duris genuit te cautibus horrens</l>

   <p>And , as Virgil in his fourth Georgick , of the Bees , perpetually raises the lowness of his subject , by the loftiness of his words , and ennobles it by comparisons drawn from empires , and from monarchs ;—</p>

   <p>we see Boileau pursuing him in the same flights , and scarcely yielding to his master . This , I think , my lord , to be the most beautiful , and most noble kind of satire . Here is the majesty of the heroic , finely mixed with the venom of the other ; and raising the delight which otherwise would be flat and vulgar , by the sublimity of the expression . I could say somewhat more of the delicacy of this and some other of his satires ; but it might turn to his prejudice , if it were carried back to France .</p>
   <p>I have given your lordship but this bare hint , in what verse and in what manner this sort of satire may be best managed . Had I time , I could enlarge on the beautiful turns of words and thoughts , which are as requisite in this , as in heroic poetry itself , of which the satire is undoubtedly a species . With these beautiful turns , I confess myself to have been unacquainted , till about twenty years ago , in a conversation which I had with that noble wit of Scotland , Sir George Mackenzie ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 49 ]</span>he asked me why I did not imitate in my verses the turns of Mr Waller and Sir John Denham ; of which he repeated many to me . I had often read with pleasure , and with some profit , those two fathers of our English poetry ; but had not seriously enough considered those beauties which give the last perfection to their works . Some sprinklings of this kind I had also formerly in my plays ; but they were casual , and not designed . But this hint , thus seasonably given me , first made me sensible of my own wants , and brought me afterwards to seek for the supply of them in other English authors . I looked over the darling of my youth , the famous Cowley ; there I found , instead of them , the points of wit , and quirks of epigram , even in the “ Davideis , ” an heroic poem , which is of an opposite nature to those puerilities ; but no elegant turns either on the word or on the thought . Then I consulted a greater genius , ( without offence to the manes of that noble author ,) I mean Milton ; but as he endeavours every where to express Homer , whose age had not arrived to that fineness , I found in him a true sublimity , lofty thoughts , which were cloathed with admirable Grecisms , and ancient words , which he had been digging from the mines of Chaucer and Spenser , and which , with all their rusticity , had somewhat of venerable in them . But I found not there neither that for which I looked . At last I had recourse to his master , Spenser , the author of that immortal poem , called the “ Fairy Queen ; ” and there I met with that which I had been looking for so long in vain . Spenser had studied Virgil to as much advantage as Milton had done Homer ; and amongst the rest of his excellencies had copied that . Looking farther into the Italian , I found Tasso had done the same ; nay more , that all the sonnets in that language are on the turn of the first thought ; which Mr Walsh , in his late ingenious preface to his poems , has observed . In short , Virgil and Ovid are the two principal fountains of them in Latin poetry . And the French at this day are so fond of them , that they judge them to be the first beauties : delicate et bien tourné , are the highest commendations which they bestow , on somewhat which they think a master-piece .</p>
   <p>An example of the turn on words , amongst a thousand others , is that in the last book of Ovid 's “ Metamorphoses : ”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Heu ! quantum scelus est , in viscera , viscera condi !</l>
     <l n="2">Congestoque avidum pinguescere corpore corpus ;</l>
     <l n="3">Alteriusque animantem animantis vivere leto .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">An example on the turn both of thoughts and words , is to be found in</l>
     <l n="5">Catullus , in the complaint of Ariadne , when she was left by Theseus ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">Tum jam nulla viro juranti fæmina credat ;</l>
     <l n="7">Nulla viri speret sermones esse fideles ;</l>
     <l n="8">Qui , dum aliquid cupiens animus prægestit apisci ,</l>
     <l n="9">Nil metuunt jurare , nihil promittere parcunt :</l>
     <l n="10">Sed simul ac cupidæ mentis satiata libido est ,</l>
     <l n="11">Dicta nihil metuere , nihil perjuria curant .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="12">An extraordinary turn upon the words , is that in Ovid 's “ Epistolæ</l>
     <l n="13">Heroidum , ” of Sappho to Phaon .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="14">Si , nisi quæ formâ poterit te digna videri ,</l>
     <l n="15">Nulla futura tua est , nulla futura tua est .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Lastly : A turn , which I cannot say is absolutely on words , for the thought turns with them , is in the fourth Georgick of Virgil ; where Orpheus is to receive his wife from hell , on express condition not to look on her till she was come on earth :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Cùm subita incautum dementia cepit amantem ;</l>
     <l n="2">Ignoscenda quidem , scirent si ignoscere Manes .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I will not burthen your lordship with more of them ; for I write to a master who understands them better than myself . But I may safely conclude them to be great beauties .— I might descend also to the mechanic beauties of heroic verse ; but we have yet no English prosodia , not so much as a tolerable dictionary , or a grammar ; so that our language is in a manner barbarous ; and what government will encourage any one , or more , who are capable of refining it , I know not : but nothing under a public expence can go through with it . And I rather fear a declination of the language , than hope an advancement of it in the present age .</p>
   <p>I am still speaking to you , my lord , though , in all probability , you are already out of hearing . Nothing , which my meanness can produce , is worthy of this long attention . But I am come to the last petition of Abraham ; if there be ten righteous lines , in this vast preface , spare it for their sake ; and also spare the next city , because it is but a little one .</p>
   <p>I would excuse the performance of this translation , if it were all my own ; but the better , though not the greater part , being the work of some gentlemen , who have succeeded very happily in their undertaking , let their excellencies atone for my imperfections , and those of my sons . I have perused some of the satires , which are done by other hands ; and they seem to me as perfect in their kind , as any thing I have seen in English verse . The common way which we have taken , is not a literal translation , but a kind of paraphrase ; or somewhat , which is yet more loose , betwixt a paraphrase and imitation . It was not possible for us , or any men , to have made it pleasant any other way . If rendering the exact sense of those authors , almost line for line , had been our business , Barten Holyday had done it already to our hands : and , by the help of his learned notes and illustrations , not only Juvenal and Persius , but , what yet is more obscure , his own verses , might be understood .</p>
   <p>But he wrote for fame , and wrote to scholars : we write only for the pleasure and entertainment of those gentlemen and ladies , who , though they are not scholars , are not ignorant : persons of understanding and good sense , who , not having been conversant in the original , or at least not having made Latin verse so much their business as to be critics in it , would be glad to find , if the wit of our two great authors be answerable to their fame and reputation in the world . We have , therefore , endeavoured to give the public all the satisfaction we are able in this kind .</p>
   <p>And if we are not altogether so faithful to our author , as our predecessors Holyday and Stapylton , yet we may challenge to ourselves this praise , that we shall be far more pleasing to our readers . We have followed our authors at greater distance , though not step by step , as they have done : for oftentimes they have gone so close , that they have trod on the heels of Juvenal and Persius , and hurt them by their too near approach . A noble author would not be pursued too close by a translator . We lose his spirit , when we think to take his body . The grosser part remains with us , but the soul is flown away in some noble expression , or some delicate turn of words , or thought . Thus Holyday , who made this way his choice , seized the meaning of Juvenal ; but the poetry has always escaped him .</p>
   <p>They who will not grant me , that pleasure is one of the ends of poetry , but that it is only a means of compassing the only end , which is instruction , must yet allow , that , without the means of pleasure , the instruction is but a bare and dry philosophy : a crude preparation of morals , which we may have from Aristotle and Epictetus , with more profit than from any poet . Neither Holyday nor Stapylton have imitated Juvenal in the poetical part of him — his diction and his elocution . Nor had they been poets , as neither of them were , yet , in the way they took , it was impossible for them to have succeeded in the poetic part .</p>
   <p>The English verse , which we call heroic , consists of no more than ten syllables ; the Latin hexameter sometimes rises to seventeen ; as , for example , this verse in Virgil :</p>
   <p>Pulverulenta putrem sonitu quatit ungula campum .</p>
   <p>Here is the difference of no less than seven syllables in a line , betwixt the English and the Latin . Now the medium of these is about fourteen syllables ; because the dactyle is a more frequent foot in hexameters than the spondee . But Holyday , without considering that he wrote with the disadvantage of four syllables less in every verse , endeavours to make one of his lines to comprehend the sense of one of Juvenal 's . According to the falsity of the proposition was the success . He was forced to crowd his verse with ill-sounding monosyllables , of which our barbarous language affords him a wild plenty ; and by that means he arrived at his pedantic end , which was to make a literal translation . His verses have nothing of verse in them , but only the worst part of it — the rhyme ; and that , into the bargain , is far from good . But , which is more intolerable , by cramming his ill-chosen , and worse-sounding monosyllables so close together , the very sense which he endeavours to explain , is become more obscure than that of his author ; so that Holyday himself cannot be understood , without as large a commentary as that which he makes on his two authors . For my own part , I can make a shift to find the meaning of Juvenal without his notes : but his translation is more difficult than his author . And I find beauties in the Latin to recompense my pains ; but , in Holyday and Stapylton , my ears , in the first place , are mortally offended ; and then their sense is so perplexed , that I return to the original , as the more pleasing task , as well as the more easy .<span type="note_anchor">[ 50 ]</span></p>
   <p>This must be said for our translation , that , if we give not the whole sense of Juvenal , yet we give the most considerable part of it : we give it , in general , so clearly , that few notes are sufficient to make us intelligible . We make our author at least appear in a poetic dress . We have actually made him more sounding , and more elegant , than he was before in English ; and have endeavoured to make him speak that kind of English , which he would have spoken had he lived in England , and had written to this age . If sometimes any of us ( and it is but seldom ) make him express the customs and manners of our native country rather than of Rome , it is , either when there was some kind of analogy betwixt their customs and ours , or when , to make him more easy to vulgar understandings , we give him those manners which are familiar to us . But I defend not this innovation , it is enough if I can excuse it . For , to speak sincerely , the manners of nations and ages are not to be confounded ; we should either make them English , or leave them Roman . If this can neither be defended nor excused , let it be pardoned at least , because it is acknowledged ; and so much the more easily , as being a fault which is never committed without some pleasure to the reader .</p>
   <p>Thus , my lord , having troubled you with a tedious visit , the best manners will be shewn in the least ceremony . I will slip away while your back is turned , and while you are otherwise employed ; with great confusion for having entertained you so long with this discourse , and for having no other recompence to make you , than the worthy labours of my fellow-undertakers in this work , and the thankful acknowledgments , prayers , and perpetual good wishes , of ,</p>

   </lg>
   <p>The satires of Lord Dorset seem to have consisted in short lampoons , if we may judge of those which have been probably lost , from such as are known to us . His mock “ Address to Mr Edward Howard , on his incomparable and incomprehensible Poem , called the British Princes ; ” another to the same on his plays ; a lampoon on an Irish lady ; and one on Lady Dorchester ,— are the only satires of his lordship 's which have been handed down to us . He probably wrote other light occasional pieces of the same nature .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>“ Would it be imagined , ” says Dr Johnson , “ that , of this rival to antiquity , all the satires were little personal invectives , and that his longest composition was a song of eleven stanzas ? The blame , however , of this exaggerated praise falls on the encomiast , not upon the author ; whose performances are , what they pretend to be , the effusions of a man of wit ; gay , vigorous , and airy . ”</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>Dryden 's recollection seems here deficient . There is , no doubt , a close imitation of the Iliad throughout the Jerusalem ; but the death of the Swedish Prince was so far from being the motive of Rinaldo 's return to the wars , that Rinaldo seems never to have heard either of that person or of his fate until he was delivered from the garden of Armida , and on his voyage to join Godfrey 's army .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span>This passage is certainly inaccurate in one particular , and probably in the rest . Sir Philip Sydney was killed at the battle of Zutphen , 16th October , 1586 , and the “ Faery Queen ” was then only commenced . For , in a dialogue written by Bryskett , as Mr Malone conjectures , betwixt 1584 and 1586 , Spenser is introduced describing himself as having undertaken a work in heroical verse , under the title of a “ Faerie Queene ; ” and it is clear that he continued to labour in that task till 1594 , when we learn , from his 80th sonnet , that he had just composed six books :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">After so long a race as I have run</l>
     <l n="2">Through Faery Land , which those six books compile ,</l>
     <l n="3">Give leave to rest me , being half foredonne ,</l>

     <l n="5">Then , as a steed refreshed after toyle ,</l>
     <l n="6">Out of my prison will I break anew ,</l>
     <l n="7">And stoutly will that second work assoyle ,</l>
     <l n="8">With strong endevour , and attention due .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It was not , therefore , the death of Sir Philip Sydney which deprived him of spirit to continue his captivating poem , since the greater part was written after that event ; but the poet 's domestic misfortunes , occasioned by Tyrone 's rebellion , which seem at once to have ruined his fortune , and broken his heart . See TODD 'S Life of Spenser , and MALONE 'S Note on this passage .</p>
   <p>It seems unlikely , that Sydney was Spenser 's Prince Arthur . Upton more justly considers Leicester , a worthless character , but the favourite of Gloriana , ( Queen Elizabeth ,) and who aspired to share her bed and throne , as depicted under that character . See TODD 'S Spenser , Vol . I . Life , p. clxviii .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 14 ]</span>This was a charge brought against Spenser so early as the days of Ben Jonson ; who says , in his Discoveries , “ Spenser , in affecting the ancients , writ no language ; yet I would have him read for his matter , but as Virgil read Ennius . ” This has been generally supposed to apply only to Spenser 's “ Pastorals ; ” but as in these he imitates rather a coarse and provincial than an obsolete dialect , the limitation of Jonson 's censure is probably imaginary . It is probable , that , as the style of poetry in the latter part of Queen Elizabeth 's reign , and in that of her successor , had become laboured and ornate , Spenser 's imitations of the old metrical romances had to his contemporaries an antique air of rude and naked simplicity , although his “ Faery Queen ” seems more intelligible to us than the compositions of Jonson himself . Dryden , whose charge was afterwards echoed by Pope , probably adopted it without very accurate investigation . Our idea of what is ancient does not necessarily imply obscurity ; on the contrary , I am afraid that to modern ears the style of Addison sounds more antiquated than that of Dr Johnson ; so that simplicity may produce the same effect as unintelligibility .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 15 ]</span>Mr Rymer , who was pleased to call himself a critic , had promised to favour the public with “ some reflections on that Paradise Lost of Milton , which some are pleased to call a poem , and to assert rhime against the slender sophistry wherewith he attacks it . ” But this promise , which is given in the end of his “ Remarks on the Tragedies of the last Age , ” he never filled up the measure of his presumption , by attempting to fulfil .</p>

   <p>This passage , as our author observes , ( p. 221. vol . iv . ) is variously construed by expositors ; and the meaning which he there adopts , that of “ applying received words to a new signification , ” seems fully as probable as that adopted in the text . Mr Malone has given the opinions of Hurd , Beattie , and De Nores , upon this disputed passage .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 17 ]</span>This resolution our author fortunately did not adhere to .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 18 ]</span>The passages of Scripture , on which Dryden founds his idea of the machinery of guardian angels , are the following , which I insert for the benefit of such readers as may not have at hand the old-fashioned book in which they occur .</p>
   <p>“ Then I lifted up mine eyes , and looked , and , behold , a certain man clothed in linen , whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz : His body also was like the beryl , and his face as the appearance of lightning , and his eyes as lamps of fire , and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass , and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude . And I Daniel alone saw the vision ; for the men that were with me saw not the vision ; but a great quaking fell upon them , so that they fled to hide themselves . Therefore I was left alone , and saw this great vision , and there remained no strength in me : for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption , and I retained no strength . Yet heard I the voice of his words : and when I heard the voice of his words , then was I in a deep sleep on my face , and my face towards the ground .</p>
   <p>“ And , behold , an hand touched me , which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands : And he said unto me , O Daniel , a man greatly beloved , understand the words that I speak unto thee , and stand upright : for unto thee am I now sent . And , when he had spoken this word unto me , I stood trembling . Then said he unto me , Fear not , Daniel : for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand , and to chasten thyself before thy God , thy words were heard , and I am come for thy words . But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days : but , lo , Michael , one of the chief princes , came to help me ; and I remained there with the kings of Persia . Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days : for yet the vision is for many days . And when he had spoken such words unto me , I set my face toward the ground , and I became dumb . And , behold , one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips : then I opened my mouth , and spake , and said unto him that stood before me , O my lord , by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me , and I have retained no strength . For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord ? for , as for me , straightway there remained no strength in me , neither is there breath left in me . Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man , and he strengthened me . And said , O man greatly beloved , fear not ; peace be unto thee , be strong , yea , be strong . And , when he had spoken unto me , I was strengthened , and said , Let my lord speak ; for thou hast strengthened me . Then said he , knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee ? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia : and when I am gone forth , lo , the prince of Grecia shall come . But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth : and there is none that holdeth with me in these things , but Michael your prince . ” — Dan . x . 5-21 .</p>
   <p>It may , however , be doubted , whether any poetical use could be made of the guardian angels here mentioned ; since our ideas of their powers are too obscure and indefinite to afford any scope for description .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 19 ]</span>In the beginning of the 12th chapter , as well as in the passage quoted , Michael is distinguished as “ the great prince which standeth up for the children of Daniel 's people . ”</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 20 ]</span>I shall imitate my predecessor , Mr Malone , in presenting the reader with Spanheim 's summary of the notes of distinction between the Greek satirical drama , and the satirical poetry of the Romans .</p>
   <p>“ La premiére différence , qui est içi à remarquer et dont on ne peut disconvenir , c'est que les Satyres ou poëmes satyriques des Grecs , etoient des piéces dramatiques , ou de théatre ; ce qu'on ne peut point dire des Satires Romaines , prises dans tous ces trois genres , dont je viens de parler , et auxquelles on a appliqué ce mot . Il y auroit peut-être plus de sujet d'en douter , à l'égard de ces premiéres Satires des anciens Romains , dont il a été fait mention , et dont il ne nous est rien resté , si les passages de deux auteurs Latins et de T. Live entre autres , qui en parlent , ne marquoient en termes exprès , qu'elles avoient précedé parmi eux les piéces dramatiques , et etoient en effet d'une autre espéce . D'ou vient aussi , que les Latins , quand ils font mention de la poësie Grecque , et d'ailleurs se contentent de donner aux premiéres ce nom de poëme , comme Ciceron le donne aux Satires de Varron , et d'autres un nom pareil à celles de Lucilius ou d'Horace .</p>
   <p>“ La seconde différence entre les poëmes satyriques des Grecs , et les Satires des Latins , vient de ce qu'il y a même quelque diversité dans le nom , laquelle ne paroit pas autrement dans les langues vulgaires . C'est qu'en effet les Grecs donnoient aux leurs le nom de Satyrus ou Satiri , de Satyriques , de piéces Satyriques , par rapport , s'entend , aux Satyres , ces hostes de bois , et ces compagnons de Baccus , qui y jouoient leur rôle : et d'ou vient aussi , qu'Horace , comme nous avons déja vû , les appelle agrestes Satyros , et ceux , qui en étoient les auteurs , du nom de Satyrorum Scriptor . Au lieu que les Romains ont dit Satira ou Satura de ces poëmes , auxquels ils en ont appliqué et restraint le nom ; que leurs auteurs et leurs grammairiens donnent une autre origine , et une autre signification de ce mot , comme celle d'un mélange de plusieurs fruits de la terre , ou bien de plusieurs mets dans un plat ; delà celle d'un mélange de plusieurs loix comprises dans une , ou enfin la signification d'un poëme mêlé de plusieurs choses .</p>
   <p>“ La troisiéme différence entre ces mêmes Satires et les piéces satyriques des Grecs est , qu'en effet l'introduction des Silénes et des Satyres , qui composoient les choeurs de ces derniéres , etoient tellement de leur essence , que sans eux elles ne pouvoient plus porter le nom de Satyres . Tellement qu'Horace , parlant entre autres de la nature de ces Satyres ou poëmes satyriques des Grecs , s'arrête a montrer , en quelle maniére on y doit faire parler Siléne , ou les Satyres ; ce qu'on leur doit faire éviter ou observer . Ce qu'l n'auroit pas fait avec tant de soin , s'il avoit cru , que la présence des Satyres ne fut pas de la nature et de l'essence , comme je viens de dire , de ces sortes de piéces , qui en portoient le nom .</p>
   <p>“ C'est à quoi on peut ajouter l'action de ces mêmes Satyres , et qui etoient propres aux piéces , qui en portoient le nom . C'est qu'en effet les danses etoient si fort de leur essence , que non seulement Aristote , comme nous avons déja veu , joint ensemble la poësie satyrique et faite pour la danse ; mais qu'un autre auteur Grec [ Lucianus # peri orchêseôs #] parle nommément des trois différentes sortes de danses attachés au théatre , la tragique , la comique , et la satyrique . D'où vient aussi , comme il le remarque ailleurs , que les Satires en prirent le nom de Sicynnistes ; c'est à dire d'une sorte de danse , qui leur etoit particuliére , comme on peut voir entre autres de ce qu'en dit Siléne dans le Cyclope , à la veuë des Satyres ; et ainsi d'ou on peut assés comprendre la force de l'épithéte de saltantes Satyros , que Virgile leur donne en quelque endroit ; ou de ce qu'Horace , dans sa premiére Ode , parle des danses des Nymphes et des Satyres , Nympharumque leues cum Satyris chori . Tout cela , comme chacun voit , n'avoit aucun raport avec les Satires Romaines , et il n'est pas nécessaire , d'en dire davantage , pour le faire entendre .</p>
   <p>“ La quatriéme différence resulte des sujets assés divers des uns et des autres . Les Satyres des Grecs , comme il a déja été remarqué , et qu'on peut juger par les titres , qui nous en restent , prenoient d'ordinaire , non seulement des sujets connus , mais fabuleux ; ce qui fait dire là-dessus à Horace , ex noto carmen fictum sequar ; des heros , par exemple , ou des demi-dieux des siécles passés , à quoi le même poëte venoit de faire allusion . Les Satires Romaines , comme leurs auteurs en parlent eux-mêmes , et qu'ils le pratiquent , s'attachoient á reprendre les vices ou les erreurs de leur siécle et de leur patrie ; à y jouer des particuliers de Rome , un Mutius entre autres , et un Lupus , avec Lucilius ; un Milonius et un Nomentanus , avec Horace ; un Crispinus et un Locustus , avec Juvenal ; c'est à dire des gens , qui nous seroient peu connus aujourdhui , sans la mention , qu'ils ont trouvé à propos d'en faire dans leurs satires .</p>
   <p>“ La cinquiéme différence paroit encore dans la maniére , de laquelle les uns et les autres traitent leurs sujets , et dans le but principal , qu'ils s'y proposent . Celui de la poësie satyrique des Grecs , etoit de tourner en ridicule des actions sérieuses , comme l'enseigne le même Horace , vertere seria ludo ; de travêstir pour ce sujet leurs dieux ou leurs héros , d'en changer le caractére , selon le besoin ; de faire par exemple d'un Achille un homme mol , suivant qu'un autre poëte Latin y fait allusion , Nec nocet autori , qui mollem fecit Achillem . C'étoit en un mot leur but principal , de rire et de plaisanter ; et d'ou vient non seulement le mot de Risus , comme il a déja été remarqué , qu'on a appliqué à ces sortes d'ouvrages , mais aussi ceux en Grec de jeux , ou même de jouëts , et de joci en Latin , comme fait encore Horace , où il parle de l'auteur tragique , qui parmi les Grecs fut le premier , qui composa de ces piéces satyriques , et suivant qu'il dit , incolumi gravitate jocum tentavit . Nons pouvons même comprendre de ce qu'il ajoute dans la suite et des epithétes , que d'autres leur donnent de ris obscénes , que cette gravité , avec laquelle on avoit d'abord temperé ces sortes d'ouvrages , en fut bannie dans la suite ; que les régles de la pudeur n'y furent guéres observées ; et qu'on en fit des spectacles assés conformes à l'humeur et à la conduite de tels acteurs que des satires petulans ou protervi , comme Horace les appelle sur ce même sujet . Et c'est à quoi contribuerent d'ailleurs leurs danses et leurs postures , dont il à été parlé , de même que celles des pantomimes parmi les Romains . Au lieu que les Satires Romaines , temoin celles qui nous restent , et á qui d'ailleurs ce nom est demeuré comme propre et attaché , avoient moins pour but de plaisanter que d'exciter ou de l'indignation , ou de la haine , facit indignatio versum , ou du mépris ; qu'elles s'attachent plus à reprendre et à mordre , qu'à faire rire ou à folâtrer . D'ou vient aussi le nom de poëme medisant , que les grammairiens leur donnent , ou celui de vers mordans , comme en parle Ovide dans un passage , où je trouve qu'il se défend de n'avoir point écrit de Satyres .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Non ego mordaci distrinxi carmine quemquam ,</l>
     <l n="2">Nec meus ullius crimina versus habet .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Je ne touche pas enfin la différence , qu'on pourroit encore alléguer de la composition diverse des unes et des autres ; les Satires Romaines , dont il est ici proprement question et qui ont été conservées jusques à nous , ayant été écrites en vers héroiques , et les poëmes satyriques des Grecs en vers jambiques . Ce qui devroit néanmoins être d'autant plus remarqué , qu'Horace ne trouve point d'autre différence entre l'inventeur des Satires Romaines et les auteurs de l'ancienne comédie , comme Cratinus et Eupolis , si non que les Satires du premier étoient écrites dans un autre genre de vers . ” — See Baron SPANHEIM 'S Dissertation , Sur les Cesars de Julien , et en général sur les ouvrages satyriques des Anciens , prefixed to his translation of Julian 's work , Amsterdam , 1728 , 4to . and Malone 's “ Dryden , ” Vol . IV . p. 130 .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 21 ]</span>Horace , in the beginning of the Fourth Satire of his First Book , introduces Lucilius as imitating the ancient Greek comedians :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Hinc omnis pendet Lucilius , hosce secutus ,</l>
     <l n="2">Mutatis tantum pedibus numerisque ; facetus ,</l>

     <l n="8">Scribendi recte ; nam ut multum , non moror .—</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Towards the end of the Tenth Satire , the poet resumes the subject , and vindicates his character of Lucilius against those who had accused him of too much severity towards the ancient satirist ; and again accuses him of carelessness , though he acknowledges his superiority to the more ancient models :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">—— fuerit Lucilius , inquam ,</l>
     <l n="2">Comis et urbanus ; fuerit limatior idem ,</l>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 22 ]</span>The original runs thus : “ Et tamen in illis veteribus nostris quæ Menippum imitati , non interpretati , quadam hilaritate conspersimus , multa admis admista ex intima philosophia , multa dicta dialectice , quæ quo facilius minus docti intelligerent jucunditate quadam ad legendum invitati ; in laudationibus , in iis ipsis antiquitatum proæmiis , philosophice scribere voluimus si modo consecuti sumus . ” — Academic lib . iii . sect . 2 . The sense of the last clause seems to be , that Varro had attempted , even in panegyrics , and studied imitations of the ancient satirists , to write philosophically , although he modestly affects to doubt of his having been able to accomplish his purpose .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 25 ]</span>From this classification we may infer , that Dryden 's idea of a Varronian satire was , that , instead of being merely didactic , it comprehended a fable or series of imaginary and ludicrous incidents , in which the author engaged the objects of his satire .

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 27 ]</span>North has left the following account of this great lawyer 's prejudices . “ He was an upright judge , if taken within himself ; and when he appeared , as he often did , and really was , partial , his inclination or prejudice , insensibly to himself , drew his judgment aside . His bias lay strangely for , and against , characters and denominations ; and sometimes , the very habits of persons . If one party was a courtier , and well dressed , and the other a sort of puritan , with a black cap and plain clothes , he insensibly thought the justice of the cause with the latter . If the dissenting , or anti-court party was at the back of a cause , he was very seldom impartial ; and the loyalists had always a great disadvantage before him . And he ever sat hard upon his lordship , in his practice , in causes of that nature , as may be observed in the cases of Cuts and Pickering , just before , and of Soams and Bernardiston elsewhere , related . It is said he was once caught . A courtier , who had a cause to be tried before him , got one to go to him , as from the king , to speak for favour to his adversary , and so carried his point ; for the Chief Justice could not think any person to be in the right , that came so unduly recommended . ” Life of Lord Keeper Guilford , p. 61 .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 35 ]</span>Dryden alludes to the beautiful description which Horace has given of his father 's paternal and watchful affection in the 6th Satire of the 1st Book . Wycherley , the friend for whom he wishes a father of equal tenderness , after having been gayest of the gay , applauded by theatres , and the object of a monarch 's jealousy , was finally thrown into jail for debt , and lay there seven long years , his father refusing him any assistance . And , although in 1697 , he was probably at liberty , for King James had interposed in his favour and paid a great part of his debts , he continued to labour under pecuniary embarrassments untill his father 's death and even after he had succeeded to his entailed property .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 36 ]</span>The abuse of personal satires , or lampoons , as they were called , was carried to a prodigious extent in the days of Dryden , when every man of fashion was obliged to write verses ; and those who had neither poetry nor wit , had recourse to ribaldry and libelling . Some observations on these lampoons may be found prefixed to the Epistle to Julian , among the pieces ascribed to Dryden .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 38 ]</span>The precise dates of Juvenal 's birth and death are disputed ; but it is certain he flourished under Domitian , famous for his cruelty against men and insects . Juvenal was banished by the tyrant , in consequence of reflecting upon the actor Paris .

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 39 ]</span>The learned Barten Holyday was born at Oxford , in the end of the 16th century . Wood says , he was second to none for his poetry and sublime fancy , and brings in witness his “ smooth translation of rough Persius , ” made before he was twenty years of age . He wrote a play called “ Technogamia , or the Marriage of the Arts , ” which was acted at Christ Church College , before James I ., and , though extremely dull and pedantic , was ill received by his Majesty . Holyday 's version of Juvenal was not published till after his death , when , in 1673 , it was inscribed to the dean and canons of Christ Church . As he had adopted the desperate resolution of comprising every Latin line within an English one , the modern reader has often reason to complain , with the embarrassed gentleman in the “ Critic , ” that the interpreter is the harder to be understood of the two .</p>

Sir Robert Stapylton died in 1669 . His verse is as harsh and uncouth as that of Holyday , who indeed charged him with plagiary ; though one would have thought the nature of the commodity would have set theft at defiance .</p>

   <p>THE</p>
   <p>FIRST SATIRE</p>
   <p>OF</p>
   <p>JUVENAL .</p>
   <p>THE ARGUMENT .</p>
   <p>The Poet gives us first a kind of humorous reason for his writing : that being provoked by hearing so many ill poets rehearse their works , he does himself justice on them , by giving them as bad as they bring . But since no man will rank himself with ill writers , it is easy to conclude , that if such wretches could draw an audience , he thought it no hard matter to excel them , and gain a greater esteem with the public . Next , he informs us more openly , why he rather addicts himself to satire than any other kind of poetry . And here he discovers , that it is not so much his indignation to ill poets as to ill men , which has prompted him to write . He , therefore , gives us a summary and general view of the vices and follies reigning in his time . So that this first satire is the natural ground-work of all the rest . Herein he confines himself to no one subject , but strikes indifferently at all men in his way . In every following satire he has chosen some particular moral which he would inculcate ; and lashes some particular vice or folly , ( an art with which our lampooners are not much acquainted ) . But our poet being desirous to reform his own age , and not daring to attempt it by an overt-act of naming living persons , inveighs only against those who were infamous in the times immediately preceding his , whereby he not only gives a fair warning to great men , that their memory lies at the mercy of future poets and historians , but also , with a finer stroke of his pen , brands even the living , and personates them under dead men 's names .</p>
   <p>I have avoided , as much as I could possibly , the borrowed learning of marginal notes and illustrations , and for that reason have translated this satire somewhat largely ; and freely own , ( if it be a fault ,) that I have likewise omitted most of the proper names , because I thought they would not much edify the reader . To conclude , if in two or three places I have deserted all the commentators , it is because I thought they first deserted my author , or at least have left him in so much obscurity , that too much room is left for guessing .</p>

    <head>THE</head>
    <head>THIRD SATIRE</head>
    <head>OF</head>
    <head>JUVENAL .</head>
    <head>THE ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>The story of this satire speaks itself . Umbritius , the supposed friend of Juvenal , and himself a poet , is leaving Rome , and retiring to Cumæ . Our author accompanies him out of town . Before they take leave of each other , Umbritius tells his friend the reasons which oblige him to lead a private life , in an obscure place . He complains , that an honest man cannot get his bread at Rome ; that none but flatterers make their fortunes there ; that Grecians , and other foreigners , raise themselves by those sordid arts which he describes , and against which he bitterly inveighs . He reckons up the several inconveniences which arise from a city life , and the many dangers which attend it ; upbraids the noblemen with covetousness , for not rewarding good poets ; and arraigns the government for starving them . The great art of this satire is particularly shown in common-places ; and drawing in as many vices , as could naturally fall into the compass of it .</head>
     <l n="1">Grieved though I am an ancient friend to lose , }</l>
     <l n="2">I like the solitary seat he chose , }</l>
     <l n="3">In quiet Cumæ<span type="note_anchor">[ 78 ]</span>fixing his repose : }</l>
     <l n="4">Where , far from noisy Rome , secure he lives ,</l>
     <l n="5">And one more citizen to Sybil gives ;</l>
     <l n="6">The road to Baiæ ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 79 ]</span>and that soft recess</l>
     <l n="7">Which all the gods with all their bounty bless ;</l>
     <l n="8">Though I in Prochyta<span type="note_anchor">[ 80 ]</span>with greater ease</l>
     <l n="9">Could live , than in a street of palaces .</l>
     <l n="10">What scene so desert , or so full of fright , }</l>
     <l n="11">As towering houses , tumbling in the night , }</l>
     <l n="12">And Rome on fire beheld by its own blazing light ? }</l>
     <l n="13">But worse than all the clattering tiles , and worse</l>
     <l n="14">Than thousand padders , is the poet 's curse ;</l>
     <l n="15">Rogues , that in dog-days cannot rhyme forbear ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 81 ]</span></l>
     <l n="16">But without mercy read , and make you hear .</l>
     <l n="17">Now while my friend , just ready to depart ,</l>
     <l n="18">Was packing all his goods in one poor cart ,</l>
     <l n="19">He stopt a little at the Conduit-gate ,</l>
     <l n="20">Where Numa modelled once the Roman state ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 82 ]</span></l>
     <l n="21">In mighty councils with his nymph retired ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 83 ]</span></l>
     <l n="22">Though now the sacred shades and founts are hired</l>
     <l n="23">By banished Jews , who their whole wealth can lay</l>
     <l n="24">In a small basket , on a wisp of hay ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 84 ]</span></l>
     <l n="25">Yet such our avarice is , that every tree</l>
     <l n="26">Pays for his head , nor sleep itself is free ;</l>
     <l n="27">Nor place , nor persons , now are sacred held ,</l>
     <l n="28">From their own grove the muses are expelled .</l>
     <l n="29">Into this lonely vale our steps we bend ,</l>
     <l n="30">I and my sullen discontented friend ;</l>
     <l n="31">The marble caves and aqueducts we view ;</l>
     <l n="32">But how adulterate now , and different from the true !</l>
     <l n="33">How much more beauteous had the fountain been</l>
     <l n="34">Embellished with her first created green ,</l>
     <l n="35">Where crystal streams through living turf had run ,</l>
     <l n="36">Contented with an urn of native stone !</l>
     <l n="37">Then thus Umbritius , with an angry frown ,</l>
     <l n="38">And looking back on this degenerate town :—</l>
     <l n="39">Since noble arts in Rome have no support ,</l>
     <l n="40">And ragged virtue not a friend at court ,</l>
     <l n="41">No profit rises from the ungrateful stage ,</l>
     <l n="42">My poverty encreasing with my age ;</l>
     <l n="43">‘ Tis time to give my just disdain a vent ,</l>
     <l n="44">And , cursing , leave so base a government .</l>
     <l n="45">Where Dædalus his borrowed wings laid by ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 85 ]</span></l>
     <l n="46">To that obscure retreat I chuse to fly :</l>
     <l n="47">While yet few furrows on my face are seen , }</l>
     <l n="48">While I walk upright , and old age is green , }</l>
     <l n="49">And Lachesis has somewhat left to spin .<span type="note_anchor">[ 86 ]</span>}</l>
     <l n="50">Now , now ‘ tis time to quit this cursed place ,</l>
     <l n="51">And hide from villains my too honest face :</l>
     <l n="52">Here let Arturius live ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 87 ]</span>and such as he ;</l>
     <l n="53">Such manners will with such a town agree .</l>
     <l n="54">Knaves , who in full assemblies have the knack</l>
     <l n="55">Of turning truth to lies , and white to black ,</l>
     <l n="56">Can hire large houses , and oppress the poor</l>
     <l n="57">By farmed excise ; can cleanse the common-shore ,</l>
     <l n="58">And rent the fishery ; can bear the dead , }</l>
     <l n="59">And teach their eyes dissembled tears to shed ; }</l>
     <l n="60">All this for gain ; for gain they sell their very head . }</l>
     <l n="61">These fellows ( see what fortune 's power can do ! )</l>
     <l n="62">Were once the minstrels of a country show ;</l>
     <l n="63">Followed the prizes through each paltry town ,</l>
     <l n="64">By trumpet-cheeks and bloated faces known .</l>
     <l n="65">But now , grown rich , on drunken holidays ,</l>
     <l n="66">At their own costs exhibit public plays ;</l>
     <l n="67">Where , influenced by the rabble 's bloody will ,</l>
     <l n="68">With thumbs bent back , they popularly kill .<span type="note_anchor">[ 88 ]</span></l>
     <l n="69">From thence returned , their sordid avarice rakes</l>
     <l n="70">In excrements again , and hires the jakes .</l>
     <l n="71">Why hire they not the town , not every thing ,</l>
     <l n="72">Since such as they have fortune in a string ,</l>
     <l n="73">Who , for her pleasure , can her fools advance ,</l>
     <l n="74">And toss them topmost on the wheel of chance ?</l>
     <l n="75">What 's Rome to me , what business have I there ?</l>

     <l n="79">Unskilled in schemes by planets to foreshow ,</l>

     <l n="84">Nor carried bawdy presents to a bride :</l>
     <l n="85">For want of these town-virtues , thus alone</l>
     <l n="86">I go , conducted on my way by none ;</l>
     <l n="87">Like a dead member from the body rent ,</l>

    <head>THE</head>
    <head>SIXTH SATIRE</head>
    <head>OF</head>
    <head>JUVENAL .</head>
    <head>THE ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>This Satire , of almost double length to any of the rest , is a bitter invective against the fair sex . It is , indeed , a common-place , from whence all the moderns have notoriously stolen their sharpest railleries . In his other satires , the poet has only glanced on some particular women , and generally scourged the men ; but this he reserved wholly for the ladies . How they had offended him , I know not ; but , upon the whole matter , he is not to be excused for imputing to all , the vices of some few amongst them . Neither was it generously done of him , to attack the weakest , as well as the fairest , part of the creation ; neither do I know what moral he could reasonably draw from it . It could not be to avoid the whole sex , if all had been true which he alleges against them ; for that had been to put an end to human kind . And to bid us beware of their artifices , is a kind of silent acknowledgment , that they have more wit than men ; which turns the satire upon us , and particularly upon the poet , who thereby makes a compliment , where he meant a libel . If he intended only to exercise his wit , he has forfeited his judgment , by making the one half of his readers his mortal enemies ; and amongst the men , all the happy lovers , by their own experience , will disprove his accusations . The whole world must allow this to be the wittiest of his satires ; and truly he had need of all his parts , to maintain , with so much violence , so unjust a charge . I am satisfied he will bring but few over to his opinion ; and on that consideration chiefly I ventured to trans late him . Though there wanted not another reason , which was , that no one else would undertake it ; at least , Sir C. S ., who could have done more right to the author , after a long delay , at length absolutely refused so ungrateful an employment ; and every one will grant , that the work must have been imperfect and lame , if it had appeared without one of the principal members belonging to it . Let the poet , therefore , bear the blame of his own invention ; and let me satisfy the world , that I am not of his opinion . Whatever his Roman ladies were , the English are free from all his imputations . They will read with wonder and abhorrence the vices of an age , which was the most infamous of any on record . They will bless themselves when they behold those examples , related of Domitian 's time ; they will give back to antiquity those monsters it produced , and believe , with reason , that the species of those women is extinguished , or , at least , that they were never here propagated . I may safely , therefore , proceed to the argument of a satire , which is no way relating to them ; and first observe , that my author makes their lust the most heroic of their vices ; the rest are in a manner but digression . He skims them over , but he dwells on this ; when he seems to have taken his last leave of it , on the sudden he returns to it : It is one branch of it in Hippia , another in Messalina , but lust is the main body of the tree . He begins with this text in the first line , and takes it up , with intermissions , to the end of the chapter . Every vice is a loader , but that is a ten . The fillers , or intermediate parts , are — their revenge ; their contrivances of secret crimes ; their arts to hide them ; their wit to excuse them ; and their impudence to own them , when they can no longer be kept secret . Then the persons to whom they are most addicted , and on whom they commonly bestow the last favours , as stage-players , fiddlers , singing-boys , and fencers . Those who pass for chaste amongst them , are not really so ; but only , for their vast doweries , are rather suffered , than loved , by their own husbands . That they are imperious , domineering , scolding wives ; set up for learning , and criticism in poetry ; but are false judges : Love to speak Greek , ( which was then the fashionable tongue , as French is now with us ) . That they plead causes at the bar , and play prizes at the bear-garden : That they are gossips and newsmongers ; wrangle with their neighbours abroad , and beat their servants at home : That they lie-in for new faces once a month ; are sluttish with their husbands in private , and paint and dress in public for their lovers : That they deal with Jews , diviners , and fortune-tellers ; learn the arts of miscarrying and barrenness ; buy children , and produce them for their own ; murder their husbands ’ sons , if they stand in their way to his estate , and make their adulterers his heirs . From hence the poet proceeds to show the occasions of all these vices , their original , and how they were introduced in Rome by peace , wealth , and luxury . In conclusion , if we will take the word of our malicious author , bad women are the general standing rule ; and the good , but some few exceptions to it .</head>
     <l n="1">In Saturn 's reign , at Nature 's early birth ,</l>
     <l n="2">There was that thing called Chastity on earth ;</l>
     <l n="3">When in a narrow cave , their common shade ,</l>
     <l n="4">The sheep , the shepherds , and their gods were laid ;</l>
     <l n="5">When reeds , and leaves , and hides of beasts , were spread , }</l>
     <l n="6">By mountain-housewives , for their homely bed , }</l>
     <l n="7">And mossy pillows raised , for the rude husband 's head . }</l>
     <l n="8">Unlike the niceness of our modern dames ,</l>
     <l n="9">( Affected nymphs , with new-affected names ,)</l>
     <l n="10">The Cynthias , and the Lesbias of our years ,</l>
     <l n="11">Who for a sparrow 's death dissolve in tears ,</l>
     <l n="12">Those first unpolished matrons , big and bold ,</l>
     <l n="13">Gave suck to infants of gigantic mould ;</l>
     <l n="14">Rough as their savage lords , who ranged the wood ,</l>
     <l n="15">And , fat with acorns , belched their windy food .</l>
     <l n="16">For when the world was buxom , fresh , and young ,</l>
     <l n="17">Her sons were undebauched , and therefore strong ;</l>
     <l n="18">And whether born in kindly beds of earth ,</l>
     <l n="19">Or struggling from the teeming oaks to birth ,</l>
     <l n="20">Or from what other atoms they begun ,</l>
     <l n="21">No sires they had , or , if a sire , the sun .</l>
     <l n="22">Some thin remains of chastity appeared</l>
     <l n="23">Even under Jove ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 107 ]</span>but Jove without a beard ;</l>
     <l n="24">Before the servile Greeks had learnt to swear</l>
     <l n="25">By heads of kings ; while yet the bounteous year</l>
     <l n="26">Her common fruits in open plains exposed ;</l>
     <l n="27">Ere thieves were feared , or gardens were inclosed .</l>
     <l n="28">At length uneasy Justice upwards flew ,</l>
     <l n="29">And both the sisters to the stars withdrew ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 108 ]</span></l>
     <l n="30">From that old æra whoring did begin ,</l>
     <l n="31">So venerably ancient is the sin .</l>
     <l n="32">Adulterers next invade the nuptial state ,</l>
     <l n="33">And marriage-beds creaked with a foreign weight ;</l>
     <l n="34">All other ills did iron times adorn ,</l>
     <l n="35">But whores and silver in one age were born .</l>
     <l n="36">Yet thou , they say , for marriage dost provide ;</l>
     <l n="37">Is this an age to buckle with a bride ?</l>
     <l n="38">They say thy hair the curling art is taught ,</l>
     <l n="39">The wedding-ring perhaps already bought ;</l>
     <l n="40">A sober man like thee to change his life !</l>
     <l n="41">What fury would possess thee with a wife ?</l>
     <l n="42">Art thou of every other death bereft ,</l>
     <l n="43">No knife , no ratsbane , no kind halter left ?</l>
     <l n="44">( For every noose compared to her 's is cheap . )</l>
     <l n="45">Is there no city-bridge from whence to leap ?</l>
     <l n="46">Would'st thou become her drudge , who dost enjoy</l>
     <l n="47">A better sort of bedfellow , thy boy ?</l>
     <l n="48">He keeps thee not awake with nightly brawls ,</l>
     <l n="49">Nor , with a begged reward , thy pleasure palls ;</l>
     <l n="50">Nor , with insatiate heavings , calls for more ,</l>
     <l n="51">When all thy spirits were drained out before .</l>
     <l n="52">But still Ursidius courts the marriage-bait ,</l>
     <l n="53">Longs for a son to settle his estate ,</l>
     <l n="54">And takes no gifts , though every gaping heir</l>
     <l n="55">Would gladly grease the rich old bachelor .</l>

     <l n="79">And yet , ‘ tis noised , a maid did once appear</l>

     <l n="93">Another does with all his motions move ,</l>

     <l n="794">The craving wife the force of magic tries ,</l>
     <l n="795">And filters for the unable husband buys ;</l>

     <l n="825">The morsel is intended for thy land .</l>
     <l n="826">Thy tutor be thy taster , ere thou eat ;</l>

     <l n="834">I , she confesses , in the fact was caught ,</l>
     <l n="835">Two sons dispatching at one deadly draught .</l>
     <l n="836">What , two ! two sons , thou viper , in one day !</l>
     <l n="837">Yes , seven , she cries , if seven were in my way .</l>
     <l n="838">Medea 's legend is no more a lie ,</l>

    <head>THE</head>
    <head>TENTH SATIRE</head>
    <head>OF</head>
    <head>JUVENAL .</head>
    <head>THE ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>The Poet 's design , in this divine Satire , is , to represent the various wishes and desires of mankind , and to set out the folly of them . He runs through all the several heads , of riches , honours , eloquence , fame for martial achievements , long life , and beauty ; and gives instances in each , how frequently they have proved the ruin of those that owned them . He concludes , therefore , that , since we generally choose so ill for ourselves , we should do better to leave it to the gods to make the choice for us . All we can safely ask of heaven , lies within a very small compass — it is but health of body and mind ; and if we have these , it is not much matter what we want besides ; for we have already enough to make us happy .</head>
     <l n="1">Look round the habitable world , how few</l>
     <l n="2">Know their own good , or , knowing it , pursue .</l>
     <l n="3">How void of reason are our hopes and fears !</l>
     <l n="4">What in the conduct of our life appears</l>
     <l n="5">So well designed , so luckily begun ,</l>
     <l n="6">But when we have our wish , we wish undone ?</l>
     <l n="7">Whole houses , of their whole desires possest ,</l>
     <l n="8">Are often ruined at their own request .</l>
     <l n="9">In wars and peace things hurtful we require ,</l>
     <l n="10">When made obnoxious to our own desire .</l>
     <l n="11">With laurels some have fatally been crowned ; }</l>
     <l n="12">Some , who the depths of eloquence have found , }</l>
     <l n="13">In that unnavigable stream were drowned . }</l>
     <l n="14">The brawny fool , who did his vigour boast ;</l>
     <l n="15">In that presuming confidence was lost ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 142 ]</span></l>
     <l n="16">But more have been by avarice opprest ,</l>
     <l n="17">And heaps of money crowded in the chest :</l>
     <l n="18">Unwieldy sums of wealth , which higher mount</l>
     <l n="19">Than files of marshalled figures can account ;</l>
     <l n="20">To which the stores of Croesus , in the scale , }</l>
     <l n="21">Would look like little dolphins , when they sail }</l>
     <l n="22">In the vast shadow of the British whale . }</l>
     <l n="23">For this , in Nero 's arbitrary time ,</l>
     <l n="24">When virtue was a guilt , and wealth a crime ,</l>
     <l n="25">A troop of cut-throat guards were sent to seize</l>
     <l n="26">The rich men 's goods , and gut their palaces :</l>
     <l n="27">The mob , commissioned by the government ,</l>
     <l n="28">Are seldom to an empty garret sent .</l>
     <l n="29">The fearful passenger , who travels late ,</l>
     <l n="30">Charged with the carriage of a paltry plate ,</l>
     <l n="31">Shakes at the moonshine shadow of a rush ,</l>
     <l n="32">And sees a red-coat rise from every bush ;</l>
     <l n="33">The beggar sings , even when he sees the place</l>
     <l n="34">Beset with thieves , and never mends his pace .</l>
     <l n="35">Of all the vows , the first and chief request</l>
     <l n="36">Of each , is — to be richer than the rest :</l>
     <l n="37">And yet no doubts the poor man 's draught controul ,</l>
     <l n="38">He dreads no poison in his homely bowl ;</l>
     <l n="39">Then fear the deadly drug , when gems divine</l>
     <l n="40">Enchase the cup , and sparkle in the wine .</l>
     <l n="41">Will you not now the pair of sages praise ,</l>

    <head>THE</head>
    <head>SIXTEENTH SATIRE</head>
    <head>OF</head>
    <head>JUVENAL .</head>
    <head>THE ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>The Poet in this satire proves , that the condition of a soldier is much better than that of a countryman ; first , because a countryman , however affronted , provoked , and struck himself , dares not strike a soldier , who is only to be judged by a court-martial ; and , by the law of Camillus , which obliges him not to quarrel without the trenches , he is also assured to have a speedy hearing , and quick dispatch ; whereas , the townsman , or peasant , is delayed in his suit by frivolous pretences , and not sure of justice when he is heard in the court . The soldier is also privileged to make a will , and to give away his estate , which he got in war , to whom he pleases , without consideration of parentage , or relations , which is denied to all other Romans . This satire was written by Juvenal , when he was a commander in Egypt : it is certainly his , though I think it not finished . And if it be well observed , you will find he intended an invective against a standing army .</head>

     <l n="5">Befriend me my good stars , and all goes right . }</l>
     <l n="6">One happy hour is to a soldier better ,</l>
     <l n="7">Than mother Juno 's<span type="note_anchor">[ 167 ]</span>recommending letter ,</l>

     <l n="13">The wrong , for fear of farther punishment .</l>
     <l n="14">Not though his teeth are beaten out , his eyes</l>
     <l n="15">Hang by a string , in bumps his forehead rise ,</l>

     <l n="18">A booted judge shall sit to try his cause ,</l>
     <l n="19">Not by the statute , but by martial laws ;</l>

     <l n="22">A wise provision ; and from thence ‘ tis clear ,</l>

     <l n="27">The regiment will rise in mutiny ,</l>
     <l n="28">The freedom of their fellow-rogue demand ,</l>
     <l n="29">And , if refused , will threaten to disband .</l>

     <l n="45">Will he , who saw the soldier 's mutton-fist ,</l>

   <p>PERSIUS .</p>
   <p>ARGUMENT OF THE PROLOGUE</p>
   <p>TO THE FIRST SATIRE .</p>
   <p>The design of the author was to conceal his name and quality . He lived in the dangerous times of the tyrant Nero , and aims particularly at him in most of his Satires . For which reason , though he was a Roman knight , and of a plentiful fortune , he would appear in this Prologue but a beggarly poet , who writes for bread . After this , he breaks into the business of the First Satire ; which is chiefly to decry the poetry then in fashion , and the impudence of those who were endeavouring to pass their stuff upon the world .</p>

   <p>THE</p>
   <p>FIRST SATIRE .</p>
   <p>IN DIALOGUE BETWIXT</p>
   <p>THE POET AND HIS FRIEND , OR MONITOR .</p>
   <p>ARGUMENT .</p>
   <p>I need not repeat , that the chief aim of the author is against bad poets in this Satire . But I must add , that he includes also bad orators , who began at that time ( as Petronius in the beginning of his book tells us ) to enervate manly eloquence by tropes and figures , ill placed , and worse applied . Amongst the poets , Persius covertly strikes at Nero ; some of whose verses he recites with scorn and indignation . He also takes notice of the noblemen , and their abominable poetry , who , in the luxury of their fortunes , set up for wits and judges . The Satire is in dialogue betwixt the author , and his friend , or monitor ; who dissuades him from this dangerous attempt of exposing great men . But Persius , who is of a free spirit , and has not forgotten that Rome was once a commonwealth , breaks through all those difficulties , and boldly arraigns the false judgment of the age in which he lives . The reader may observe , that our poet was a Stoic philosopher ; and that all his moral sentences , both here and in all the rest of his Satires , are drawn from the dogmas of that sect .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Nothing is remaining of Atticus Labeo ( so he is called by the learned Casaubon ) ; nor is he mentioned by any other poet , besides Persius . Casaubon , from an old commentator on Persius , says , that he made a very foolish translation of Homer 's Iliads .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>He describes a poet , preparing himself to rehearse his works in public , which was commonly performed in August . A room was hired , or lent , by some friend ; a scaffold was raised , and a pulpit placed for him who was to hold forth ; who borrowed a new gown , or scoured his old one , and adorned his ears with jewels , &amp; c .</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The Romans wrote on cedar and cypress tables , in regard of the duration of the wood . Ill verses might justly be afraid of frankincense ; for the papers in which they were written , were fit for nothing but to wrap it up .</p>

     <l n="3">Candia ) . From his name the first month of the year is called January .</l>
     <l n="4">He was pictured with two faces , one before and one behind ; as regarding</l>
     <l n="5">the past time and the future . Some of the mythologists think he was</l>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>He speaks of the country in the foregoing verses ; the praises of which are the most easy theme for poets , but which a bad poet cannot naturally describe : then he makes a digression to Romulus , the first king of Rome , who had a rustical education ; and enlarges upon Quintius Cincinnatus , a Roman senator , who was called from the plough to be dictator of Rome .</p>
   <p>Note VIII .</p>
   <p>With periods , points , and tropes , he slurs his crimes . P. 213 .</p>
   <p>Persius here names antitheses , or seeming contradictions ; which , in this place , are meant for rhetorical flourishes , as I think , with Casaubon .</p>

   <p>Other verses of Nero , that were mere bombast . I only note , that the repetition of these and the former verses of Nero , might justly give the poet a caution to conceal his name .</p>

   <p>Mænas and Atys .— P . 214 .</p>
   <p>Poems on the Mænades , who were priestesses of Bacchus ; and of Atys , who made himself an eunuch to attend on the sacrifices of Cybele , called Berecynthia by the poets . She was mother of the gods .</p>
   <p>Note XII .</p>
   <p>Two painted serpents shall on high appear .— P . 215 .</p>
   <p>Two snakes , twined with each other , were painted on the walls , by the ancients , to show the place was holy .</p>
   <p>Note XIII .</p>
   <p>Old Lucilius .— P . 215 .</p>
   <p>Lucilius wrote long before Horace , who imitates his manner of satire , but far excels him in the design .</p>
   <p>Note XIV .</p>
   <p>King Midas has a snout , and asses ears .— P . 215 .</p>
   <p>The story is vulgar , that Midas , king of Phrygia , was made judge betwixt Apollo and Pan , who was the best musician : he gave the prize to Pan ; and Apollo , in revenge , gave him asses ears . He wore his hair long to hide them ; but his barber discovering them , and not daring to divulge the secret , dug a hole in the ground , and whispered into it : the place was marshy ; and , when the reeds grew up , they repeated the words which were spoken by the barber . By Midas , the poet meant Nero .</p>

    <head>THE</head>
    <head>SECOND SATIRE</head>
    <head>OF</head>
    <head>PERSIUS .</head>
    <head>DEDICATED TO HIS FRIEND</head>
    <head>PLOTIUS MACRINUS ,</head>
    <head>ON HIS BIRTH-DAY .</head>
    <head>THE ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>This Satire contains a most grave and philosophical argument , concerning prayers and wishes . Undoubtedly it gave occasion to Juvenal 's tenth satire ; and both of them had their original from one of Plato 's dialogues , called the “ Second Alcibiades . ” Our author has induced it with great mystery of art , by taking his rise from the birth-day of his friend ; on which occasions , prayers were made , and sacrifices offered by the native . Persius , commending , first , the purity of his friend 's vows , descends to the impious and immoral requests of others . The satire is divided into three parts . The first is the exordium to Macrinus , which the poet confines within the compass of four verses : the second relates to the matter of the prayers and vows , and an enumeration of those things , wherein men commonly sinned against right reason , and offended in their requests : the third part consists in showing the repugnances of those prayers and wishes , to those of other men , and inconsistencies with themselves . He shows the original of these vows , and sharply inveighs against them ; and , lastly , not only corrects the false opinion of mankind concerning them , but gives the true doctrine of all addresses made to heaven , and how they may be made acceptable to the powers above , in excellent precepts , and more worthy of a Christian than a Heathen .</head>
     <l n="1">Let this auspicious morning be exprest</l>
     <l n="2">With a white stone ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 195 ]</span>distinguished from the rest ,</l>
     <l n="3">White as thy fame , and as thy honour clear ,</l>
     <l n="4">And let new joys attend on thy new added year .</l>
     <l n="5">Indulge thy genius , and o'erflow thy soul ,</l>
     <l n="6">Till thy wit sparkle , like the cheerful bowl .</l>
     <l n="7">Pray ; for thy prayers the test of heaven will bear ,</l>
     <l n="8">Nor need'st thou take the gods aside to hear ;</l>
     <l n="9">While others , even the mighty men of Rome ,</l>
     <l n="10">Big swelled with mischief , to the temples come ,</l>
     <l n="11">And in low murmurs , and with costly smoke ,</l>
     <l n="12">Heaven 's help to prosper their black vows , invoke :</l>
     <l n="13">So boldly to the gods mankind reveal</l>
     <l n="14">What from each other they , for shame , conceal .</l>
     <l n="15">Give me good fame , ye powers , and make me just ;</l>

     <l n="18">My wealthy uncle from this world remove ?</l>
     <l n="19">Or , O thou Thunderer 's son , great Hercules ,</l>
     <l n="20">That once thy bounteous deity would please</l>
     <l n="21">To guide my rake upon the chinking sound</l>

     <l n="23">O were my pupil fairly knocked o ’ the head ,</l>
     <l n="24">I should possess the estate if he were dead !</l>
     <l n="25">He 's so far gone with rickets , and with the evil ,</l>
     <l n="26">That one small dose would send him to the devil .</l>
     <l n="27">This is my neighbour Nerius his third spouse ,</l>

     <l n="32">Thy wishes , thou art wickedly devout ;</l>
     <l n="33">In Tyber ducking thrice , by break of day ,</l>

     <l n="37">Wouldst thou prefer him to some man ? Suppose</l>
     <l n="38">I dipped among the worst , and Staius chose ?</l>
     <l n="39">Which of the two would thy wise head declare</l>
     <l n="40">The trustier tutor to an orphan heir ?</l>
     <l n="41">Or , put it thus :— Unfold to Staius , straight ,</l>
     <l n="42">What to Jove 's ear thou didst impart of late :</l>
     <l n="43">He 'll stare , and O , good Jupiter ! will cry ,</l>
     <l n="44">Canst thou indulge him in this villainy ?</l>
     <l n="45">And think'st thou Jove himself with patience then</l>
     <l n="46">Can hear a prayer condemned by wicked men ?</l>
     <l n="47">That , void of care , he lolls supine in state ,</l>
     <l n="48">And leaves his business to be done by fate ,</l>
     <l n="49">Because his thunder splits some burly tree ,</l>
     <l n="50">And is not darted at thy house and thee ;</l>
     <l n="51">Or that his vengeance falls not at the time ,</l>
     <l n="52">Just at the perpetration of thy crime ,</l>
     <l n="53">And makes thee a sad object of our eyes ,</l>

     <l n="65">Pretending force of magic to prevent ,</l>
     <l n="66">By virtue of her nasty excrement ;</l>
     <l n="67">Then dandles him with many a muttered prayer ,</l>
     <l n="68">That heaven would make him some rich miser 's heir ,</l>

     <l n="70">Which to ensure , she adds a length of navel-string .</l>

     <l n="81">Would stop the grant ; the very over-care</l>

   <p>The ancients thought themselves tainted and polluted by night itself , as well as bad dreams in the night ; and therefore purified themselves by washing their heads and hands every morning , which custom the Turks observe to this day .</p>

   <p>Fit for Ergenna 's prayer and sacrifice .— P . 223 .</p>

   <p>Our superstitions with our life begin .— P . 223 .</p>
   <p>The poet laughs at the superstitious ceremonies which the old women made use of in their lustration , or purification days , when they named their children , which was done on the eighth day to females , and on the ninth to males .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>It was the opinion both of Grecians and Romans , that the gods , in visions and dreams , often revealed to their favourites a cure for their diseases , and sometimes those of others . Thus Alexander dreamed of an herb which cured Ptolemy . These gods were principally Apollo and Esculapius ; but , in aftertimes , the same virtue and good-will was attributed to Isis and Osiris . Which brings to my remembrance an odd passage in Sir Thomas Brown 's Religio Medici , or in his Vulgar Errors ; the sense whereof is , that we are beholden , for many of our discoveries in physic , to the courteous revelation of spirits . By the expression , of “ visions purged from phlegm , ” our author means such dreams or visions as proceed not from natural causes , or humours of the body , but such as are sent from heaven ; and are , therefore , certain remedies .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Brazen vessels , in which the public treasures of the Romans were kept : it may be the poet means only old vessels , which were called # Kronia #, from the Greek name of Saturn . Note also , that the Roman treasury was in the temple of Saturn .</p>
   <p>Note VIII .</p>
   <p>—— Or Numa 's earthen ware .— P . 225 .</p>
   <p>Under Numa , the second king of Rome , and for a long time after him , the holy vessels for sacrifice were of earthen-ware ; according to the superstitious rites which were introduced by the same Numa : though afterwards , when Memmius had taken Corinth , and Paulus Emilius had conquered Macedonia , luxury began amongst the Romans , and then their utensils of devotion were of gold and silver , &amp; c .</p>
   <p>Note IX .</p>
   <p>And makes Calabrian wool , &amp; c .— P. 225 .</p>
   <p>The wool of Calabria was of the finest sort in Italy , as Juvenal also tells us . The Tyrian stain is the purple colour dyed at Tyrus ; and I suppose , but dare not positively affirm , that the richest of that dye was nearest our crimson , and not scarlet , or that other colour more approaching to the blue . I have not room to justify my conjecture .</p>
   <p>Note X .</p>
   <p>As maids to Venus offer baby-toys .— P . 225 .</p>
   <p>Those baby-toys were little babies , or poppets , as we call them ; in Latin , pupæ ; which the girls , when they came to the age of puberty , or child bearing , offered to Venus ; as the boys , at fourteen or fifteen , offered their bullæ , or bosses .</p>
   <p>Note XI .</p>
   <p>A cake , thus given , is worth a hecatomb .— P . 226 .</p>
   <p>A cake of barley , or coarse wheat-meal , with the bran in it . The meaning is , that God is pleased with the pure and spotless heart of the offerer , and not with the riches of the offering . Laberius , in the fragments of his “ Mimes , ” has a verse like this — Puras , Deus , non plenas aspicit manus .— What I had forgotten before , in its due place , I must here tell the reader , that the first half of this satire was translated by one of my sons , now in Italy ; but I thought so well of it , that I let it pass without any alteration .</p>
   <p>THE</p>
   <p>THIRD SATIRE</p>
   <p>OF</p>
   <p>PERSIUS .</p>
   <p>THE ARGUMENT .</p>
   <p>Our author has made two Satires concerning study , the first and the third : the first related to men ; this to young students , whom he desired to be educated in the Stoic philosophy . He himself sustains the person of the master , or preceptor , in this admirable Satire , where he upbraids the youth of sloth , and negligence in learning . Yet he begins with one scholar reproaching his fellow-students with late rising to their books . After which , he takes upon him the other part of the teacher ; and , addressing himself particularly to young noblemen , tells them , that , by reason of their high birth , and the great possessions of their fathers , they are careless of adorning their minds with precepts of moral philosophy : and , withal , inculcates to them the miseries which will attend them in the whole course of their life , if they do not apply themselves betimes to the knowledge of virtue , and the end of their creation , which he pathetically insinuates to them . The title of this satire , in some ancient manuscripts , was , “ the Reproach of Idleness ; ” though in others of the scholiasts it is inscribed , “ Against the Luxury and Vices of the Rich . ” In both of which , the intention of the poet is pursued , but principally in the former .</p>
   <note>I remember I translated this satire when I was a king 's scholar at Westminster school , for a Thursday-night 's exercise ; and believe , that it , and many other of my exercises of this nature in English verse , are still in the hands of my learned master , the Rev . Dr Busby .</note>

     <l n="20">Some peevish quarrel straight he strives to pick ,</l>
     <l n="21">His quill writes double , or his ink 's too thick ;</l>
     <l n="22">Infuse more water ,— now ‘ tis grown so thin ,</l>

     <l n="2">And parchment with the smoother side displayed .— P . 231 .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The students used to write their notes on parchments ; the inside , on which they wrote , was white ; the other side was hairy , and commonly yellow . Quintilian reproves this custom , and advises rather table-books , lined with wax , and a stile , like that we use in our vellum table-books , as more easy .</p>
   <p>Note II .</p>
   <p>A fuming-pan thy Lares to appease .— P . 232 .</p>
   <p>Before eating , it was customary to cut off some part of the meat , which was first put into a pan , or little dish , then into the fire , as an offering to the household gods : this they called a Libation .</p>
   <p>Note III .</p>
   <p>Drawn from the root of some old Tuscan tree .— P . 232 .</p>
   <p>The Tuscans were accounted of most ancient nobility . Horace observes this in most of his compliments to Mæcenas , who was derived from the old kings of Tuscany ; now the dominion of the Great Duke .</p>
   <p>Note IV .</p>
   <p>Who , clad in purple , canst thy censor greet .— P . 232 .</p>
   <p>The Roman knights , attired in the robe called trabea , were summoned by the censor to appear before him , and to salute him in passing by , as their names were called over . They led their horses in their hand . See more of this in Pompey 's Life , written by Plutarch .</p>
   <p>Note V .</p>
   <p>Sicilian tortures , and the brazen bull .— P . 233 .</p>
   <p>Some of the Sicilian kings were so great tyrants , that the name is become proverbial . The brazen bull is a known story of Phalaris , one of those tyrants , who , when Perillus , a famous artist , had presented him with a bull of that metal hollowed within , which , when the condemned person was inclosed in it , would render the sound of a bull 's roaring , caused the workman to make the first experiment ,— docuitque suum mugire juvencum .</p>
   <p>Note VI .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The wretch , who , sitting at his plenteous board ,</l>
     <l n="2">Looked up , and viewed on high the pointed sword .— P . 233 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>He alludes to the story of Damocles , a flatterer of one of those Sicilian tyrants , namely Dionysius . Damocles had infinitely extolled the happiness of kings : Dionysius , to convince him of the contrary , invited him to a feast , and clothed him in purple ; but caused a sword , with the point downward , to be hung over his head by a silken twine ; which , when he perceived , he could eat nothing of the delicates that were set before him .</p>
   <p>Note VII .</p>
   <p>Thou in the Stoic-porch , severely bred .— P . 233 .</p>
   <p>The Stoics taught their philosophy under a porticus , to secure their scholars from the weather . Zeno was the chief of that sect .</p>
   <p>Note VIII .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Where on the walls , by Polygnotus ’ hand ,</l>
     <l n="2">The conquered Medians in trunk-breeches stand .— P . 233 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Polygnotus , a famous painter , who drew the pictures of the Medes and Persians , conquered by Miltiades , Themistocles , and other Athenian captains , on the walls of the portico , in their natural habits .</p>
   <p>Note IX .</p>

   <p>Pythagoras , of Samos , made the allusion of the Y , or Greek upsilon , to Vice and Virtue . One side of the letter being broad , characters Vice , to which the ascent is wide and easy ; the other side represents Virtue , to which the passage is strait and difficult ; and perhaps our Saviour might also allude to this , in those noted words of the evangelist , “ The way to heaven , ” &amp; c .</p>

   <p>His heels stretched out , and pointing to the gate . P. 237 .</p>
   <p>The Romans were buried without the city ; for which reason , the poet says , that the dead man 's heels were stretched out towards the gate .</p>

   <p>—— Mad Orestes .— P . 238 .</p>
   <p>Orestes was son to Agamemnon and Clytemnestra . Agamemnon , at his return from the Trojan wars , was slain by Ægysthus , the adulterer of Clytemnestra . Orestes , to revenge his father 's death , slew both Ægysthus and his mother ; for which he was punished with madness by the Eumenides , or Furies , who continually haunted him .</p>
   <p>THE</p>
   <p>FOURTH SATIRE</p>
   <p>OF</p>
   <p>PERSIUS .</p>
   <p>THE ARGUMENT .</p>
   <p>Our author , living in the time of Nero , was contemporary and friend to the noble poet Lucan . Both of them were sufficiently sensible , with all good men , how unskilfully he managed the commonwealth ; and perhaps might guess at his future tyranny , by some passages , during the latter part of his first five years ; though he broke not out into his great excesses , while he was restrained by the counsels and authority of Seneca . Lucan has not spared him in the poem of his Pharsalia ; for his very compliment looked asquint , as well as Nero .<span type="note_anchor">[ 219 ]</span>Persius has been bolder , but with caution likewise . For here , in the person of young Alcibiades , he arraigns his ambition of meddling with state-affairs without judgment , or experience . It is probable , that he makes Seneca , in this satire , sustain the part of Socrates , under a borrowed name ; and , withal , discovers some secret vices of Nero , concerning his lust , his drunkenness , find his effeminacy , which had not yet arrived to public notice . He also reprehends the flattery of his courtiers , who endeavoured to make all his vices pass for virtues . Covetousness was undoubtedly none of his faults ; but it is here described as a veil cast over the true meaning of the poet , which was to satirize his prodigality and voluptuousness ; to which he makes a transition . I find no instance in history of that emperor 's being a Pathic , though Persius seems to brand him with it . From the two dialogues of Plato , both called “ Alcibiades , ” the poet took the arguments of the second and third satires ; but he inverted the order of them , for the third satire is taken from the first of those dialogues .</p>
   <p>The commentators before Casaubon were ignorant of our author 's secret meaning ; and thought he had only written against young noblemen in general , who were too forward in aspiring to public magistracy ; but this excellent scholiast has unravelled the whole mystery , and made it apparent , that the sting of the satire was particularly aimed at Nero .</p>

    <head>TRANSLATIONS FROM PERSIUS .</head>
    <head>SATIRE IV .</head>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">Socrates .— P . 243 .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Socrates , whom the oracle of Delphos praised as the wisest man of his age , lived in the time of the Peloponnesian war . He , finding the uncertainty of natural philosophy , applied himself wholly to the moral . He was master to Xenophon and Plato , and to many of the Athenian young noblemen ; amongst the rest to Alcibiades , the most lovely youth then living ; afterwards a famous captain , whose life is written by Plutarch .</p>
   <p>Note II .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Tell me , thou pupil to great Pericles ,</l>
     <l n="2">Our second hope , my Alcibiades .— P . 243 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Pericles was tutor , or rather overseer , of the will of Clinias , father to Alcibiades . While Pericles lived , who was a wise man , and an excellent orator , as well as a great general , the Athenians had the better of the war .</p>
   <p>Note III .</p>
   <p>Can'st punish crimes .— P . 244 .</p>
   <p>That is , by death . When the judges would condemn a malefactor , they cast their votes into an urn ; as , according to the modern custom , a balloting-box . If the suffrages were marked with # Theta #, they signified the sentence of death to the offender ; as being the first letter of # Thanatos #, which , in English , is death .</p>
   <p>Note IV .</p>
   <p>Drink hellebore .— P . 244 .</p>
   <p>The poet would say , that such an ignorant young man , as he here describes , is fitter to be governed himself than to govern others . He therefore advises him to drink hellebore , which purges the brain .</p>
   <p>Note V .</p>
   <p>Say , dost thou know Vectidius ?— P . 245 .</p>
   <p>The name of Vectidius is here used appellatively , to signify any rich covetous man , though perhaps there might be a man of that name then living . I have translated this passage paraphrastically , and loosely ; and leave it for those to look on , who are not unlike the picture .</p>
   <p>Note VI .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">When he should thanks to Pan and Pales pay ,</l>
     <l n="2">And better Ceres .— P . 245 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Pan , the god of shepherds , and Pales , the goddess presiding over rural affairs ; whom Virgil invocates in the beginning of his second Georgic . I give the epithet of better to Ceres , because she first taught the use of corn for bread , as the poets tell us ; men , in the first rude ages , feeding only on acorns , or mast , instead of bread .</p>
   <p>Note VII .</p>
   <p>Not five , the strongest that the Circus breeds .— P . 246 .</p>
   <p>The learned Holyday ( who has made us amends for his bad poetry in this and the rest of these satires , with his excellent illustrations ) , here tells us , from good authority , that the number five does not allude to the five fingers of one man , but to five strong men , such as were skilful in the five robust exercises then in practice at Rome , and were performed in the circus , or public place ordained for them . These five he reckons up in this manner : 1 . The Cæstus , or Whirlbatts , described by Virgil in his fifth Æneid ; and this was the most dangerous of all the rest . The 2d was the foot-race . The 3d , the discus ; like the throwing a weighty ball ; a sport now used in Cornwall , and other parts of England ; we may see it daily practised in Red-Lyon Fields . The 4th , was the Saltus , or Leaping ; and the 5th , wrestling naked , and besmeared with oil . They who practised in these five manly exercises were called # Pentathloi #.</p>

     <l n="1">If , with thy guards , thou scour'st the streets by night ,</l>
     <l n="2">And dost in murders , rapes , and spoils , delight .— P . 247 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Persius durst not have been so bold with Nero as I dare now ; and therefore there is only an intimation of that in him which I publicly speak : I mean , of Nero 's walking the streets by night in disguise , and committing all sorts of outrages , for which he was sometimes well beaten .</p>
   <p>Note IX .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Not what thou dost appear ,</l>
     <l n="2">But what thou art , and find the beggar there .— P . 247 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Look into thyself , and examine thy own conscience ; there thou shalt find , that , how wealthy soever thou appearest to the world , yet thou art but a beggar ; because thou art destitute of all virtues , which are the riches of the soul . This also was a paradox of the Stoic school .</p>
   <p>THE</p>
   <p>FIFTH SATIRE</p>
   <p>OF</p>
   <p>PERSIUS .</p>
   <p>INSCRIBED TO</p>
   <p>THE REV . DR BUSBY .</p>
   <p>THE SPEAKERS</p>
   <p>PERSIUS AND CORNUTUS .</p>
   <p>THE ARGUMENT .</p>
   <p>The judicious Casaubon , in his proem to this Satire , tells us , that Aristophanes , the grammarian , being asked , what poem of Archilochus ’ Iambics he preferred before the rest ; answered , the longest . His answer may justly be applied to this Fifth Satire ; which , being of a greater length than any of the rest , is also by far the most instructive . For this reason I have selected it from all the others , and inscribed it to my learned master , Dr Busby ; to whom I am not only obliged myself for the best part of my own education , and that of my two sons ; but have also received from him the first and truest taste of Persius . May he be pleased to find , in this translation , the gratitude , or at least some small acknowledgment , of his unworthy scholar , at the distance of forty-two years from the time when I departed from under his tuition . This Satire consists of two distinct parts : The first contains the praises of the stoic philosopher , Cornutus , master and tutor to our Persius ; it also declares the love and piety of Persius to his well-deserving master ; and the mutual friendship which continued betwixt them , after Persius was now grown a man ; as also his exhortation to young noblemen , that they would enter themselves into his institution . From hence he makes an artful transition into the second part of his subject ; wherein he first complains of the sloth of scholars , and afterwards persuades them to the pursuit of their true liberty . Here our author excellently treats that paradox of the Stoics , which affirms , that the wise or virtuous man is only free , and that all vicious men are naturally slaves ; and , in the illustration of this dogma , he takes up the remaining part of this inimitable Satire .</p>

     <l n="31">One was our labour , one was our repose ,</l>
     <l n="32">One frugal supper did our studies close .</l>
     <l n="33">Sure on our birth some friendly planet shone ;</l>
     <l n="34">And , as our souls , our horoscope<span type="note_anchor">[ 234 ]</span>was one :</l>

     <l n="2">Progne .— P . 252 .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Progne was wife to Tereus , king of Thracia . Tereus fell in love with Philomela , sister to Progne , ravished her , and cut out her tongue ; in revenge of which , Progne killed Itys , her own son by Tereus , and served him up at a feast , to be eaten by his father .</p>
   <p>Note II .</p>
   <p>Thyestes .— P . 252 .</p>
   <p>Thyestes and Atreus were brothers , both kings . Atreus , to revenge himself of his unnatural brother , killed the sons of Thyestes , and invited him to eat them .</p>
   <p>Note III .</p>
   <p>When first my childish robe resigned the charge .— P . 253 .</p>
   <p>By the childish robe , is meant the Proetexta , or first gowns which the Roman children of quality wore . These were welted with purple ; and on those welts were fastened the bullæ , or little bells ; which , when they came to the age of puberty , were hung up , and consecrated to the Lares , or Household Gods .</p>
   <p>Note IV .</p>
   <p>And my white shield proclaimed my liberty .— P . 253 .</p>
   <p>The first shields which the Roman youths wore were white , and without any impress or device on them , to shew they had yet achieved nothing in the wars .</p>
   <p>Note V .</p>
   <p>And by my better Socrates was bred .— P . 253 .</p>
   <p>Socrates , by the oracle , was declared to be the wisest of mankind : he instructed many of the Athenian young noblemen in morality , and amongst the rest Alcibiades .</p>
   <p>Note VI .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Sure on our birth some friendly planet shone ;</l>
     <l n="2">And , as our souls , our horoscope was one .— P . 254 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Astrologers divide the heaven into twelve parts , according to the number of the twelve signs of the zodiac . The sign , or constellation , which rises in the east at the birth of any man , is called the Ascendant : Persius therefore judges , that Cornutus and he had the same , or a like nativity .</p>
   <p>Note VII .</p>
   <p>And both have Saturn 's rage , repelled by Jove .— P . 254 .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Astrologers have an axiom , that whatsoever Saturn ties is loosed by</l>
     <l n="2">Jupiter . They account Saturn to be a planet of a malevolent nature , and</l>
     <l n="3">Jupiter of a propitious influence .</l>

     <l n="5">The Stoic institutes .— P . 255 .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Zeno was the great master of the Stoic philosophy ; and Cleanthes was second to him in reputation . Cornutus , who was master or tutor to Persius , was of the same school .</p>
   <p>Note IX .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Not that which bondmen from their masters find ,</l>
     <l n="2">The privilege of doles .— P . 255 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>When a slave was made free , he had the privilege of a Roman born , which was to have a share in the donatives , or doles of bread , &amp; c. which were distributed by the magistrates among the people .</p>
   <p>Note X .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">—— Nor yet to inscribe</l>
     <l n="2">Their names in this or t'other Roman tribe .— P . 255 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The Roman people was distributed into several tribes . He who was made free was enrolled into some one of them ; and thereupon enjoyed the common privileges of a Roman citizen .</p>
   <p>Note XI .</p>
   <p>Slaves are made citizens by turning round .— P . 255 .</p>
   <p>The master , who intended to enfranchize a slave , carried him before the city prætor , and turned him round , using these words , “ I will that this man be free . ”</p>
   <p>Note XII .</p>
   <p>Now Marcus Dama is his worship 's name .— P . 256 .</p>
   <p>Slaves had only one name before their freedom ; after it they were admitted to a prænomen , like our christened names : so Dama is now called Marcus Dama .</p>

   <p>The text of the Roman laws was written in red letters , which was called the Rubric ; translated here , in more general words , “ The letter of the law . ”</p>
   <p>Note XVII .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Virtue and vice are never in one soul ;</l>
     <l n="2">A man is wholly wise , or wholly is a fool .— P . 257 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The Stoics held this paradox , that any one vice , or notorious folly , which they called madness , hindered a man from being virtuous ; that a man was of a piece , without a mixture , either wholly vicious , or good ; one virtue or vice , according to them , including all the rest .</p>
   <p>Note XVIII .</p>
   <p>—— Him that freed thee by the prætor 's wand .— P . 258 .</p>
   <p>The prætor held a wand in his hand , with which he softly struck the slave on the head , when he declared him free .</p>
   <p>Note XIX .</p>
   <p>—— Says Phædria to his man .— P . 259 .</p>
   <p>This alludes to the play of Terence , called “ The Eunuch ; ” which was excellently imitated of late in English , by Sir Charles Sedley .<span type="note_anchor">[ 254 ]</span>In the first scene of that comedy , Phædria was introduced with his man , Pamphilus , discoursing , whether he should leave his mistress Thais , or return to her , now that she had invited him .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>He who sued for any office amongst the Romans , was called a candidate , because he wore a white gown ; and sometimes chalked it , to make it appear whiter . He rose early , and went to the levees of those who headed the people ; saluted also the tribes severally , when they were gathered together to chuse their magistrates ; and distributed a largess amongst them , to engage them for their voices ; much resembling our elections of Parliamentmen .</p>
   <p>Note XXI .</p>
   <p>—— On Herod 's day .— P . 260 .</p>
   <p>The commentators are divided what Herod this was , whom our author mentions ; whether Herod the Great , whose birth-day might possibly be celebrated , after his death , by the Herodians , a sect amongst the Jews , who thought him their Messiah ; or Herod Agrippa , living in the author 's time , and after it . The latter seems the more probable opinion .</p>
   <p>Note XXII .</p>
   <p>Then a cracked egg-shell thy sick fancy frights .— P . 260 .</p>
   <p>The ancients had a superstition , contrary to ours , concerning egg-shells : they thought , that if an egg-shell were cracked , or a hole bored in the bottom of it , they were subject to the power of sorcery . We as vainly break the bottom of an egg-shell , and cross it when we have eaten the egg , lest some hag should make use of it in bewitching us , or sailing over the sea in it , if it were whole . The rest of the priests of Isis , and her one-eyed or squinting priestess , is more largely treated in the sixth satire of Juvenal , where the superstitions of women are related .</p>

    <head>THE</head>
    <head>SIXTH SATIRE</head>
    <head>OF</head>
    <head>PERSIUS .</head>
    <head>TO</head>
    <head>CÆSIUS BASSUS ,</head>
    <head>A LYRIC POET .</head>
    <head>THE ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>This Sixth Satire treats an admirable common-place of moral philosophy , of the true use of riches . They are certainly intended by the Power who bestows them , as instruments and helps of living commodiously ourselves ; and of administering to the wants of others , who are oppressed by fortune . There are two extremes in the opinions of men concerning them . One error , though on the right hand , yet a great one , is , that they are no helps to a virtuous life ; the other places all our happiness in the acquisition and possession of them ; and this is undoubtedly the worse extreme . The mean betwixt these , is the opinion of the Stoics , which is , that riches may be useful to the leading a virtuous life ; in case we rightly understand how to give according to right reason , and how to receive what is given us by others . The virtue of giving well , is called liberality ; and it is of this virtue that Persius writes in this satire , wherein he not only shows the lawful use of riches , but also sharply inveighs against the vices which are opposed to it ; and especially of those , which consist in the defects of giving , or spending , or in the abuse of riches . He writes to Cæsius Bassus , his friend , and a poet also . Enquires first of his health and studies ; and afterwards informs him of his own , and where he is now resident . He gives an account of himself , that he is endeavouring , by little and little , to wear off his vices ; and , particularly , that he is combating ambition , and the desire of wealth . He dwells upon the latter vice ; and being sensible , that few men either desire , or use , riches as they ought , he endeavours to convince them of their folly , which is the main design of the whole satire .</head>

     <l n="49">His jolly brother , opposite in sense , }</l>

     <l n="157">Nor tell me , in a dying father 's tone ,—</l>
     <l n="158">Be careful still of the main chance , my son ;</l>
     <l n="159">Put out thy principal in trusty hands ,</l>
     <l n="160">Live on the use , and never dip thy lands :</l>
     <l n="161">But yet what 's left for me ?— What 's left , my friend !</l>
     <l n="162">Ask that again , and all the rest I spend .</l>

    <head>NOTES</head>
    <head>ON</head>
    <head>TRANSLATIONS FROM PERSIUS .</head>
    <head>SATIRE VI .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Note I .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">Has winter caused thee , friend , to change thy seat ,</l>
     <l n="3">And seek in Sabine air a warm retreat .— P . 268 .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>All the studious , and particularly the poets , about the end of August , began to set themselves on work , refraining from writing during the heats of the summer . They wrote by night , and sat up the greatest part of it ; for which reason the product of their studies was called their elucubrations , or nightly labours . They who had country-seats retired to them while they studied , as Persius did to his , which was near the port of the Moon in Etruria ; and Bassus to his , which was in the country of the Sabines , nearer Rome .</p>
   <p>Note II .</p>
   <p>Now sporting on thy lyre the loves of youth .— P . 268 .</p>
   <p>This proves Cæsius Bassus to have been a lyric poet . It is said of him , that by an eruption of the flaming mountain Vesuvius , near which the greatest part of his fortune lay , he was burnt himself , together with all his writings .</p>
   <p>Note III .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Who in a drunken dream beheld his soul</l>
     <l n="2">The fifth within the transmigrating roll .— P . 269 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I call it a drunken dream of Ennius ; not that my author , in this place , gives me any encouragement for the epithet , but because Horace , and all who mention Ennius , say he was an excessive drinker of wine . In a dream , or vision , call you it which you please , he thought it was revealed to him , that the soul of Pythagoras was transmigrated into him ; as Pythagoras before him believed , that himself had been Euphorbus in the wars of Troy . Commentators differ in placing the order of this soul , and who had it first . I have here given it to the peacock ; because it looks more according to the order of nature , that it should lodge in a creature of an inferior species , and so by gradation rise to the informing of a man . And Persius favours me , by saying , that Ennius was the fifth from the Pythagorean peacock .</p>
   <p>Note IV .</p>
   <p>My friend is shipwrecked on the Brutian strand .— P . 270 .</p>
   <p>Perhaps this is only a fine transition of the poet , to introduce the business of the satire ; and not that any such accident had happened to one of the friends of Persius . But , however , this is the most poetical description of any in our author ; and since he and Lucan were so great friends , I know not but Lucan might help him in two or three of these verses , which seem to be written in his style ; certain it is , that besides this description of a shipwreck , and two lines more , which are at the end of the second satire , our poet has written nothing elegantly . I will , therefore , transcribe both the passages , to justify my opinion . The following are the last verses , saving one , of the second satire :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Compositum jus , fasque animi ; sanctosque recessus</l>
     <l n="2">Mentis , et incoctum generoso pectus honesto .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">The others are those in this present satire , which are subjoined :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">—— trabe rupta , Bruttia Saxa</l>
     <l n="5">Prendit amicus inops , remque omnem , surdaque vota</l>
     <l n="6">Condidit Ionio : jacet ipse in littore ; et una</l>
     <l n="7">Ingentes de puppe Dei : jamque obvia mergis</l>
     <l n="8">Costa ratis laceræ .——</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="9">Note V .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="10">From thy new hope , and from thy growing store ,</l>
     <l n="11">Now lend assistance , and relieve the poor .— P . 270 .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The Latin is , Nunc et de cespite vivo , frange aliquid . Casaubon only opposes the cespes vivus , which , word for word , is the living turf , to the harvest , or annual income ; I suppose the poet rather means , sell a piece of land already sown , and give the money of it to my friend , who has lost all by shipwreck ; that is , do not stay till thou hast reaped , but help him immediately , as his wants require .</p>
   <p>Note VI .</p>
   <p>Nor beg with a blue table on his back .— P . 270 .</p>
   <p>Holyday translates it a green table : the sense is the same ; for the table was painted of the sea-colour , which the shipwrecked person carried on his back , expressing his losses , thereby to excite the charity of the spectators .</p>
   <p>Note VII .</p>
   <p>Or without spices lets thy body burn .— P . 270 .</p>
   <p>The bodies of the rich , before they were burnt , were embalmed with spices ; or rather spices were put into the urn with the relics of the ashes . Our author here names cinnamum and cassia , which cassia was sophisticated with cherry-gum , and probably enough by the Jews , who adulterate all things which they sell . But whether the ancients were acquainted with the spices of the Molucca Islands , Ceylon , and other parts of the Indies , or whether their pepper and cinnamon , &amp; c. were the same with ours , is another question . As for nutmegs and mace , it is plain that the Latin names for them are modern .</p>
   <p>Note VIII .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Cæsar salutes the queen and senate thus :—</l>
     <l n="2">My arms are on the Rhine victorious .— P . 271 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The Cæsar , here mentioned , is Caius Caligula , who affected to triumph over the Germans , whom he never conquered , as he did over the Britons ; and accordingly sent letters , wrapt about with laurels , to the senate and the Empress Cæsonia , whom I here call queen ; though I know that name was not used amongst the Romans ; but the word empress would not stand in that verse , for which reason I adjourned it to another . The dust , which was to be swept away from the altars , was either the ashes which were left there after the last sacrifice for victory , or might perhaps mean the dust or ashes which were left on the altars since some former defeat of the Romans by the Germans ; after which overthrow , the altars had been neglected .</p>
   <p>Note IX .</p>
   <p>The goodly empress .— P . 271 .</p>
   <p>Cæsonia , wife to Caius Caligula , who afterwards , in the reign of Claudius , was proposed , but ineffectually , to be married to him , after he had executed Messalina for adultery .</p>
   <p>Note X .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The captive Germans , of gigantic size ,</l>
     <l n="2">Are ranked in order , and are clad in frize .— P . 271 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>He means only such as were to pass for Germans in the triumph , large-bodied men , as they are still , whom the empress clothed new with coarse garments , for the greater ostentation of the victory .</p>
   <p>Note XI .</p>
   <p>Know , I have vowed two hundred gladiators .— P . 271 .</p>
   <p>A hundred pair of gladiators were beyond the purse of a private man to give ; therefore this is only a threatening to his heir , that he could do what he pleased with his estate .</p>
   <p>Note XII .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">—— Shouldst thou demand of me</l>
     <l n="2">My torch , when I in course run after thee .— P . 272 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Why shouldst thou , who art an old fellow , hope to outlive me , and be my heir , who am much younger ? He who was first in the course or race , delivered the torch , which he carried , to him who was second .</p>
   <p>Note XIII .</p>
   <p>Well fed , and fat as Cappadocian slaves .— P . 273 .</p>
   <p>Who were famous for their lustiness , and being , as we call it , in good liking . They were set on a stall when they were exposed to sale , to show the good habit of their body ; and made to play tricks before the buyers , to show their activity and strength .</p>
   <p>Note XIV .</p>
   <p>Then say , Chrysippus .— P . 273 .</p>
   <p>Chrysippus , the Stoic , invented a kind of argument , consisting of more than three propositions , which is called sorites , or a heap . But as Chrysippus could never bring his propositions to a certain stint , so neither can a covetous man bring his craving desires to any certain measure of riches , beyond which he could not wish for any more .</p>
   <p>THE</p>
   <p>WORKS OF VIRGIL ,</p>
   <p>TRANSLATED</p>
   <p>INTO ENGLISH VERSE .</p>
   <p>WORKS OF VIRGIL .</p>
   <p>This great work was undertaken by Dryden , in 1694 , and published , by subscription , in 1697 . One hundred and one subscribers gave five guineas each to furnish the engravings for the work ; if indeed this was any thing more than a genteel pretext for increasing the profit of the author ; for Spence has informed us , that the old plates used for Ogleby 's “ Virgil , ” were retouched for that of his great successor . Another class of subscribers , two hundred and fifty-two in number , contributed two guineas each . As the names of those who encouraged this great national labour have some claim to distinction , the reader will find , prefixed to this edition , an accurate copy of both lists , as they stand in the first folio edition . On 28th June , 1697 , the following advertisement appeared in the London Gazette :</p>
   <p>“ The Works of Virgil ; containing his Pastorals , Georgics , and Eneis , translated into English verse , by Mr Dryden , and adorned with one hundred cuts , will be finished this week , and be ready next week to be delivered , as subscribed for , in quires , upon bringing the receipt for the first payment , and paying the second . Printed for Jacob Tonson , &amp; c . ”</p>
   <p>In 1709 , Tonson published a second edition of Dryden 's “ Virgil , ” with the plates reduced , in three volumes , 8vo ; and various others have since appeared . In 1803 , a new edition was given to the public , revised and corrected by Henry Carey , LL. D . This is so correct , that , although it has been uniformly compared with the original edition of Tonson , I have thought it advisable to follow the modern editor in some corrections of the punctuation and reading . In other cases , where I have adhered to the folio , I have placed Dr Carey 's alteration at the bottom of the page . It is hardly worth while to notice , that there is a slight alteration of the arrangement of Dryden 's prolegomena ; the Dedication to the “ Pastorals ” being placed immediately before that class of poems , instead of preceding the Life , as in the original folio . Dryden 's Notes and Observations , which , in the original , are printed together at the end of the work , are , in this edition , dispersed and subjoined to the different Books containing the passages to which they refer .</p>

    <head>RECOMMENDATORY POEMS .</head>
    <head>TO</head>
    <head>MR DRYDEN ,</head>
    <head>ON HIS EXCELLENT</head>
    <head>TRANSLATION OF VIRGIL .</head>
     <l n="1">Whene'er great Virgil 's lofty verse I see ,</l>
     <l n="2">The pompous scene charms my admiring eye .</l>
     <l n="3">There different beauties in perfection meet ;</l>
     <l n="4">The thoughts as proper , as the numbers sweet ;</l>
     <l n="5">And , when wild Fancy mounts a daring height ,</l>
     <l n="6">Judgment steps in , and moderates her flight .</l>
     <l n="7">Wisely he manages his wealthy store ,</l>
     <l n="8">Still says enough , and yet implies still more :</l>
     <l n="9">For , though the weighty sense be closely wrought ,</l>
     <l n="10">The reader 's left to improve the pleasing thought .</l>
     <l n="11">Hence we despaired to see an English dress</l>
     <l n="12">Should e'er his nervous energy express ;</l>
     <l n="13">For who could that in fettered rhyme inclose ,</l>
     <l n="14">Which , without loss , can scarce be told in prose ?</l>
     <l n="15">But you , great Sir , his manly genius raise ,</l>
     <l n="16">And make your copy share an equal praise .</l>
     <l n="17">Oh ! how I see thee , in soft scenes of love ,</l>
     <l n="18">Renew those passions he alone could move !</l>
     <l n="19">Here Cupid 's charms are with new art exprest ,</l>
     <l n="20">And pale Eliza leaves her peaceful rest —</l>
     <l n="21">Leaves her Elysium , as if glad to live , }</l>
     <l n="22">To love , and wish , to sigh , despair , and grieve , }</l>
     <l n="23">And die again for him that would again deceive . }</l>
     <l n="24">Nor does the mighty Trojan less appear</l>
     <l n="25">Than Mars himself , amidst the storms of war .</l>
     <l n="26">Now his fierce eyes with double fury glow ,</l>
     <l n="27">And a new dread attends the impending blow :</l>
     <l n="28">The Daunian chiefs their eager rage abate ,</l>
     <l n="29">And , though unwounded , seem to feel their fate .</l>
     <l n="30">Long the rude fury of an ignorant age ,</l>
     <l n="31">With barbarous spite , profaned his sacred page .</l>
     <l n="32">The heavy Dutchmen , with laborious toil ,</l>
     <l n="33">Wrested his sense , and cramped his vigorous style .</l>
     <l n="34">No time , no pains , the drudging pedants spare ,</l>
     <l n="35">But still his shoulders must the burden bear ;</l>
     <l n="36">While , through the mazes of their comments led ,</l>
     <l n="37">We learn , not what he writes , but what they read .</l>
     <l n="38">Yet , through these shades of undistinguished night ,</l>
     <l n="39">Appeared some glimmering intervals of light ;</l>
     <l n="40">Till mangled by a vile translating sect ,</l>
     <l n="41">Like babes by witches in effigie rackt :</l>
     <l n="42">Till Ogleby , mature in dulness , rose ,</l>
     <l n="43">And Holbourn doggrel , and low chiming prose ,</l>
     <l n="44">His strength and beauty did at once depose .</l>
     <l n="45">But now the magic spell is at an end ,</l>
     <l n="46">Since even the dead , in you , have found a friend .</l>
     <l n="47">You free the bard from rude oppressors ’ power ,</l>
     <l n="48">And grace his verse with charms unknown before .</l>
     <l n="49">He , doubly thus obliged , must doubting stand ,</l>

     <l n="82">From the lewd rhymes of grovelling Ogleby .</l>
     <l n="83">Then shall his verse in graceful pomp appear ,</l>
     <l n="84">Nor will his birth renew the ancient jar :</l>
     <l n="85">On those Greek cities we shall look with scorn ,</l>
     <l n="86">And in our Britain think the poet born .</l>

   <p>THE</p>
   <p>LIFE</p>
   <p>OF</p>
   <p>PUBLIUS VIRGILIUS MARO ,</p>
   <p>BY KNIGHTLY CHETWOOD , D. D .<span type="note_anchor">[ 270 ]</span></p>
   <p>Virgil was born at Mantua , which city was built no less than three hundred years before Rome , and was the capital of the New Hetruria , as himself , no less antiquary than poet , assures us . His birth is said to have happened in the first consulship of Pompey the Great , and Licinius Crassus : but , since the relater of this presently after contradicts himself , and Virgil 's manner of addressing to Octavius implies a greater difference of age than that of seven years , as appears by his First Pastoral , and other places , it is reasonable to set the date of it something backward ; and the writer of his Life having no certain memorials to work upon , seems to have pitched upon the two most illustrious consuls he could find about that time , to signalize the birth of so eminent a man . But it is beyond all question , that he was born on or near the 15th of October , which day was kept festival in honour of his memory by the Latin , as the birth-day of Homer was by the Greek poets . And so near a resemblance there is betwixt the lives of these two famous epic writers , that Virgil seems to have followed the fortune of the other , as well as the subject and manner of his writing . For Homer is said to have been of very mean parents , such as got their bread by day-labour ; so is Virgil . Homer is said to be base-born ; so is Virgil . The former to have been born in the open air , in a ditch , or by the bank of a river ; so is the latter . There was a poplar planted near the place of Virgil 's birth , which suddenly grew up to an unusual height and bulk , and to which the superstitious neighbourhood attributed marvellous virtue : Homer had his poplar too , as Herodotus relates , which was visited with great veneration . Homer is described by one of the ancients to have been of a slovenly and neglected mien and habit ; so was Virgil . Both were of a very delicate and sickly constitution ; both addicted to travel , and the study of astrology ; both had their compositions usurped by others ; both envied and traduced during their lives . We know not so much as the true names of either of them with any exactness ; for the critics are not yet agreed how the word Virgil should be written , and of Homer 's name there is no certainty at all . Whosoever shall consider this parallel in so many particulars , ( and more might be added ,) would be inclined to think , that either the same stars ruled strongly at the nativities of them both ; or , what is a great deal more probable , that the Latin grammarians , wanting materials for the former part of Virgil 's life , after the legendary fashion , supplied it out of Herodotus ; and , like ill face-painters , not being able to hit the true features , endeavoured to make amends by a great deal of impertinent landscape and drapery .</p>
   <p>Without troubling the reader with needless quotations now , or afterwards , the most probable opinion is , that Virgil was the son of a servant , or assistant , to a wandering astrologer , who practised physic : for medicus , magus , as Juvenal observes , usually went together ; and this course of life was followed by a great many Greeks and Syrians , of one of which nations it seems not improbable that Virgil 's father was . Nor could a man of that profession have chosen a fitter place to settle in , than that most superstitious tract of Italy , which , by her ridiculous rites and ceremonies , as much enslaved the Romans , as the Romans did the Hetrurians by their arms . This man , therefore , having got together some money , which stock he improved by his skill in planting and husbandry , had the good fortune , at last , to marry his master 's daughter , by whom he had Virgil : and this woman seems , by her mother 's side , to have been of good extraction ; for she was nearly related to Quintilius Varus , whom Paterculus assures us to have been of an illustrious , though not patrician , family ; and there is honourable mention made of it in the history of the second Carthaginian war . It is certain , that they gave him very good education ; to which they were inclined , not so much by the dreams of his mother , and those presages which Donatus relates , as by the early indications which he gave of a sweet disposition and excellent wit . He passed the first seven years of his life at Mantua , not seventeen , as Scaliger miscorrects his author ; for the initia ætatis can hardly be supposed to extend so far . From thence he removed to Cremona , a noble Roman colony , and afterwards to Milan ; in all which places , he prosecuted his studies with great application . He read over all the best Latin and Greek authors ; for which he had convenience by the no remote distance of Marseilles , that famous Greek colony , which maintained its politeness and purity of language in the midst of all those barbarous nations amongst which it was seated ; and some tincture of the latter seems to have descended from them down to the modern French . He frequented the most eminent professors of the Epicurean philosophy , which was then much in vogue , and will be always , in declining and sickly states .<span type="note_anchor">[ 271 ]</span>But , finding no satisfactory account from his master Syron , he passed over to the Academic school ; to which he adhered the rest of his life , and deserved , from a great emperor , the title of — The Plato of Poets . He composed at leisure hours a great number of verses on various subjects ; and , desirous rather of a great than early fame , he permitted his kinsman and fellow-student , Varus , to derive the honour of one of his tragedies to himself . Glory , neglected in proper time and place , returns often with large increase : and so he found it ; for Varus afterwards proved a great instrument of his rise . In short , it was here that he formed the plan , and collected the materials , of all those excellent pieces which he afterwards finished , or was forced to leave less perfect by his death . But , whether it were the unwholesomeness of his native air , of which he somewhere complains ; or his too great abstinence , and night-watchings at his study , to which he was always addicted , as Augustus observes ; or possibly the hopes of improving himself by travel — he resolved to remove to the more southern tract of Italy ; and it was hardly possible for him not to take Rome in his way , as is evident to any one who shall cast an eye on the map of Italy . And therefore the late French editor of his works is mistaken , when he asserts , that he never saw Rome till he came to petition for his estate . He gained the acquaintance of the master of the horse to Octavius , and cured a great many diseases of horses , by methods they had never heard of . It fell out , at the same time , that a very fine colt , which promised great strength and speed , was presented to Octavius ; Virgil assured them , that he came of a faulty mare , and would prove a jade : Upon trial , it was found as he had said . His judgment proved right in several other instances ; which was the more surprising , because the Romans knew least of natural causes of any civilized nation in the world ; and those meteors and prodigies , which cost them incredible sums to expiate , might easily have been accounted for by no very profound naturalist . It is no wonder , therefore , that Virgil was in so great reputation , as to be at last introduced to Octavius himself . That prince was then at variance with Marc Antony , who vexed him with a great many libelling letters , in which he reproaches him with the baseness of his parentage , that he came of a scrivener , a rope-maker , and a baker , as Suetonius tells us . Octavius finding that Virgil had passed so exact a judgment upon the breed of dogs and horses , thought that he possibly might be able to give him some light concerning his own . He took him into his closet , where they continued in private a considerable time . Virgil was a great mathematician ; which , in the sense of those times , took in astrology ; and , if there be any thing in that art , ( which I can hardly believe ,) if that be true which the ingenious De la Chambre asserts confidently , that , from the marks on the body , the configuration of the planets at a nativity may be gathered , and the marks might be told by knowing the nativity , never had one of those artists a fairer opportunity to show his skill than Virgil now had ; for Octavius had moles upon his body , exactly resembling the constellation called Ursa Major . But Virgil had other helps ; the predictions of Cicero and Catulus ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 272 ]</span>and that vote of the senate had gone abroad , that no child , born at Rome in the year of his nativity , should be bred up , because the seers assured them that an emperor was born that year . Besides this , Virgil had heard of the Assyrian and Egyptian prophecies , ( which , in truth , were no other but the Jewish ,) that about that time a great king was to come into the world . Himself takes notice of them , ( Æn . VI . ) where he uses a very significant word , now in all liturgies , hujus in adventu ; so in another place , adventu propiore Dei .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">At his foreseen approach already quake</l>
     <l n="2">Assyrian kingdoms , and Mæotis ’ lake ;</l>
     <l n="3">Nile hears him knocking at his seven-fold gate .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Every one knows whence this was taken . It was rather a mistake than impiety in Virgil , to apply these prophecies , which belonged to the Saviour of the world , to the person of Octavius ; it being a usual piece of flattery , for near a hundred years together , to attribute them to their emperors and other great men . Upon the whole matter , it is very probable , that Virgil predicted to him the empire at this time . And it will appear yet the more , if we consider , that he assures him of his being received into the number of the gods , in his First Pastoral , long before the thing came to pass ; which prediction seems grounded upon his former mistake . This was a secret not to be divulged at that time ; and therefore it is no wonder that the slight story in Donatus was given abroad to palliate the matter . But certain it is , that Octavius dismissed him with great marks of esteem , and earnestly recommended the protection of Virgil 's affairs to Pollio , then lieutenant of the Cisalpine Gaul , where Virgil 's patrimony lay . This Pollio , from a mean original , became one of the most considerable persons of his time ; a good general , orator , statesman , historian , poet , and favourer of learned men ; above all , he was a man of honour in those critical times . He had joined with Octavius and Antony in revenging the barbarous assassination of Julius Cæsar ; when they two were at variance , he would neither follow Antony , whose courses he detested , nor join with Octavius against him , out of a grateful sense of some former obligations . Augustus , who thought it his interest to oblige men of principles , notwithstanding this , received him afterwards into favour , and promoted him to the highest honours . And thus much I thought fit to say of Pollio , because he was one of Virgil 's greatest friends . Being therefore eased of domestic cares , he pursues his journey to Naples . The charming situation of that place , and view of the beautiful villas of the Roman nobility , equaling the magnificence of the greatest kings ; the neighbourhood of Baiæ , whither the sick resorted for recovery , and the statesman when he was politicly sick ; whither the wanton went for pleasure , and witty men for good company ; the wholesomeness of the air , and improving conversation , the best air of all , contributed not only to the re-establishing his health , but to the forming of his style , and rendering him master of that happy turn of verse , in which he much surpasses all the Latins , and , in a less advantageous language , equals even Homer himself . He proposed to use his talent in poetry , only for scaffolding to build a convenient fortune , that he might prosecute , with less interruption , those nobler studies to which his elevated genius led him , and which he describes in these admirable lines :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Me vero primum dulces ante omnia Musæ ,</l>
     <l n="2">Quarum sacra fero ingenti percussus amore ,</l>
     <l n="3">Accipiant ; cælique vias , et sidera , monstrent ,</l>
     <l n="4">Defectus Solis varios , Lunæque labores ;</l>
     <l n="5">Unde tremor terris , &amp; c .</l>

   <p>But the current of that martial age , by some strange antiperistasis , drove so violently towards poetry , that he was at last carried down with the stream ; for not only the young nobility , but Octavius , and Pollio , Cicero in his old age , Julius Cæsar , and the stoical Brutus , a little before , would needs be tampering with the Muses . The two latter had taken great care to have their poems curiously bound , and lodged in the most famous libraries ; but neither the sacredness of those places , nor the greatness of their names , could preserve ill poetry . Quitting therefore the study of the law , after having pleaded but one cause with indifferent success , he resolved to push his fortune this way , which he seems to have discontinued for some time ; and that may be the reason why the Culex , his first pastoral now extant , has little besides the novelty of the subject , and the moral of the fable , which contains an exhortation to gratitude , to recommend it . Had it been as correct as his other pieces , nothing more proper and pertinent could have at that time been addressed to the young Octavius ; for , the year in which he presented it , probably at Baiæ , seems to be the very same in which that prince consented ( though with seeming reluctance ) to the death of Cicero , under whose consulship he was born , the preserver of his life , and chief instrument of his advancement . There is no reason to question its being genuine , as the late French editor does ; its meanness , in comparison of Virgil 's other works , ( which is that writer 's only objection ,) confutes himself ; for Martial , who certainly saw the true copy , speaks of it with contempt ; and yet that pastoral equals , at least , the address to the Dauphin , which is prefixed to the late edition . Octavius , to unbend his mind from application to public business , took frequent turns to Baiæ , and Sicily , where he composed his poem called Sicelides , which Virgil seems to allude to in the pastoral beginning Sicelides Musæ . This gave him opportunity of refreshing that prince 's memory of him ; and about that time he wrote his Ætna . Soon after he seems to have made a voyage to Athens , and at his return presented his Ceiris , a more elaborate piece , to the noble and eloquent Messala . The forementioned author groundlessly taxes this as supposititious ; for , besides other critical marks , there are no less than fifty or sixty verses , altered , indeed , and polished , which he inserted in the Pastorals , according to his fashion ; and from thence they were called Eclogues , or Select Bucolics : we thought fit to use a title more intelligible , the reason of the other being ceased ; and we are supported by Virgil 's own authority , who expressly calls them carmina pastorum . The French editor is again mistaken , in asserting , that the Ceiris is borrowed from the ninth of Ovid 's Metamorphoses : he might have more reasonably conjectured it to be taken from Parthenius , the Greek poet , from whom Ovid borrowed a great part of his work . But it is indeed taken from neither , but from that learned , unfortunate poet , Apollonius Rhodius , to whom Virgil is more indebted than to any other Greek writer , excepting Homer . The reader will be satisfied of this , if he consults that author in his own language ; for the translation is a great deal more obscure than the original .</p>
   <p>Whilst Virgil thus enjoyed the sweets of a learned privacy , the troubles of Italy cut off his little subsistence ; but , by a strange turn of human affairs , which ought to keep good men from ever despairing , the loss of his estate proved the effectual way of making his fortune . The occasion of it was this : Octavius , as himself relates , when he was but nineteen years of age , by a masterly stroke of policy , had gained the veteran legions into his service , and , by that step , outwitted all the republican senate . They grew now very clamorous for their pay ; the treasury being exhausted , he was forced to make assignments upon land ; and none but in Italy itself would content them . He pitched upon Cremona , as the most distant from Rome ; but that not sufficing , he afterwards threw in part of the state of Mantua . Cremona was a rich and noble colony , settled a little before the invasion of Hannibal . During that tedious and bloody war , they had done several important services to the commonwealth ; and , when eighteen other colonies , pleading poverty and depopulation , refused to contribute money , or to raise recruits , they of Cremona voluntarily paid a double quota of both . But past services are a fruitless plea ; civil wars are one continued act of ingratitude . In vain did the miserable mothers , with their famishing infants in their arms , fill the streets with their numbers , and the air with lamentations ; the craving legions were to be satisfied at any rate . Virgil , involved in the common calamity , had recourse to his old patron , Pollio ; but he was , at this time , under a cloud ; however , compassionating so worthy a man , not of a make to struggle through the world , he did what he could , and recommended him to Mæcenas , with whom he still kept a private correspondence . The name of this great man being much better known than one part of his character , the reader , I presume , will not be displeased if I supply it in this place .</p>
   <p>Though he was of as deep reach , and easy dispatch of business , as any in his time , yet he designedly lived beneath his true character . Men had oftentimes meddled in public affairs , that they might have more ability to furnish for their pleasures : Mæcenas , by the honestest hypocrisy that ever was , pretended to a life of pleasure , that he might render more effectual service to his master . He seemed wholly to amuse himself with the diversions of the town , but , under that mask , was the greatest minister of his age . He would be carried in a careless , effeminate posture through the streets in his chair , even to the degree of a proverb ; and yet there was not a cabal of ill-disposed persons which he had not early notice of , and that too in a city as large as London and Paris , and perhaps two or three more of the most populous , put together . No man better understood that art so necessary to the great — the art of declining envy . Being but of a gentleman 's family , not patrician , he would not provoke the nobility by accepting invidious honours , but wisely satisfied himself , that he had the ear of Augustus , and the secret of the empire . He seems to have committed but one great fault , which was , the trusting a secret of high consequence to his wife ; but his master , enough uxorious himself , made his own frailty more excusable , by generously forgiving that of his favourite : he kept , in all his greatness , exact measures with his friends ; and , chusing them wisely , found , by experience , that good sense and gratitude are almost inseparable . This appears in Virgil and Horace . The former , besides the honour he did him to all posterity , re-toured his liberalities at his death ; the other , whom Mæcenas recommended with his last breath , was too generous to stay behind , and enjoy the favour of Augustus ; he only desired a place in his tomb , and to mingle his ashes with those of his deceased benefactor . But this was seventeen hundred years ago .<span type="note_anchor">[ 273 ]</span>Virgil , thus powerfully supported , thought it mean to petition for himself alone , but resolutely solicits the cause of his whole country , and seems , at first , to have met with some encouragement ; but , the matter cooling , he was forced to sit down contented with the grant of his own estate . He goes therefore to Mantua , produces his warrant to a captain of foot , whom he found in his house . Arius , who had eleven points of the law , and fierce<span type="note_anchor">[ 274 ]</span>of the services he had rendered to Octavius , was so far from yielding possession , that , words growing betwixt them , he wounded him dangerously , forced him to fly , and at last to swim the river Mincius to save his life . Virgil , who used to say , that no virtue was so necessary as patience , was forced to drag a sick body half the length of Italy , back again to Rome , and by the way , probably , composed his Ninth Pastoral , which may seem to have been made up in haste , out of the fragments of some other pieces ; and naturally enough represents the disorder of the poet 's mind , by its disjointed fashion , though there be another reason to be given elsewhere of its want of connection . He handsomely states his case in that poem , and , with the pardonable resentments of injured innocence , not only claims Octavius 's promise , but hints to him the uncertainty of human greatness and glory . All was taken in good part by that wise prince ; at last effectual orders were given . About this time , he composed that admirable poem , which is set first , out of respect to Cæsar ; for he does not seem either to have had leisure , or to have been in the humour of making so solemn an acknowledgment , till he was possessed of the benefit . And now he was in so great reputation and interest , that he resolved to give up his land to his parents , and himself to the court . His Pastorals were in such esteem , that Pollio , now again in high favour with Cæsar , desired him to reduce them into a volume . Some modern writer , that has a constant flux of verse , would stand amazed , how Virgil could employ three whole years in revising five or six hundred verses , most of which , probably , were made some time before ; but there is more reason to wonder , how he could do it so soon in such perfection . A coarse stone is presently fashioned ; but a diamond , of not many carats , is many weeks in sawing , and , in polishing , many more . He who put Virgil upon this , had a politic good end in it .</p>
   <p>The continued civil wars had laid Italy almost waste ; the ground was uncultivated and unstocked ; upon which ensued such a famine and insurrection , that Cæsar hardly escaped being stoned at Rome ; his ambition being looked upon by all parties as the principal occasion of it . He set himself therefore with great industry to promote country improvements ; and Virgil was serviceable to his design , as the good Keeper of the Bees , Georg . iv .</p>

   <p>REDIIT CULTUS AGRIS —</p>
   <p>which seems to be the motive that induced Mæcenas to put him upon writing his Georgics , or books of husbandry : a design as new in Latin verse , as pastorals , before Virgil , were in Italy : which work took up seven of the most vigorous years of his life ; for he was now , at least , thirty-four years of age ; and here Virgil shines in his meridian . A great part of this work seems to have been rough-drawn before he left Mantua ; for an ancient writer has observed , that the rules of husbandry , laid down in it , are better calculated for the soil of Mantua , than for the more sunny climate of Naples ; near which place , and in Sicily , he finished it . But , lest his genius should be depressed by apprehensions of want , he had a good estate settled upon him , and a house in the pleasantest part of Rome ; the principal furniture of which was a well-chosen library , which stood open to all comers of learning and merit : and what recommended the situation of it most , was the neighbourhood of his Mæcenas ; and thus he could either visit Rome , or return to his privacy at Naples , through a pleasant road , adorned on each side with pieces of antiquity , of which he was so great a lover , and , in the intervals of them , seemed almost one continued street of three days ’ journey .</p>
   <p>Cæsar , having now vanquished Sextus Pompeius , ( a spring-tide of prosperities breaking in upon him , before he was ready to receive them as he ought ,) fell sick of the imperial evil , the desire of being thought something more than man . Ambition is an infinite folly ; when it has attained to the utmost pitch of human greatness , it soon falls to making pretensions upon heaven . The crafty Livia would needs be drawn in the habit of a priestess by the shrine of the new god ; and this became a fashion not to be dispensed with amongst the ladies . The devotion was wonderous great amongst the Romans ; for it was their interest , and , which sometimes avails more , it was the mode . Virgil , though he despised the heathen superstitions , and is so bold as to call Saturn and Janus by no better a name than that of old men , and might deserve the title of subverter of superstitions , as well as Varro , thought fit to follow the maxim of Plato his master , that every one should serve the gods after the usage of his own country ; and therefore was not the last to present his incense , which was of too rich a composition for such an altar ; and , by his address to Cæsar on this occasion , made an unhappy precedent to Lucan and other poets which came after him .— Georg . i. and iii . And this poem being now in great forwardness , Cæsar , who , in imitation of his predecessor Julius , never intermitted his studies in the camp , and much less in other places , refreshing himself by a short stay in a pleasant village of Campania would needs be entertained with the rehearsal of some part of it . Virgil recited with a marvellous grace , and sweet accent of voice , but his lungs failing him , Mæcenas himself supplied his place for what remained . Such a piece of condescension would now be very surprising ; but it was no more than customary amongst friends , when learning passed for quality .<span type="note_anchor">[ 275 ]</span>Lælius , the second man of Rome in his time , had done as much for that poet , out of whose dross Virgil would sometimes pick gold , as himself said , when one found him reading Ennius ; ( the like he did by some verses of Varro , and Pacuvius , Lucretius , and Cicero , which he inserted into his works . ) But learned men then lived easy and familiarly with the great : Augustus himself would sometimes sit down betwixt Virgil and Horace , and say jestingly , that he sat betwixt sighing and tears , alluding to the asthma of one , and rheumatic eyes of the other . He would frequently correspond with them , and never leave a letter of theirs unanswered ; nor were they under the constraint of formal superscriptions in the beginning , nor of violent superlatives at the close , of their letter : the invention of these is a modern refinement ; in which this may be remarked , in passing , that “ humble servant ” is respect , but “ friend ” an affront ; which notwithstanding implies the former , and a great deal more . Nor does true greatness lose by such familiarity ; and those who have it not , as Mæcenas and Pollio had , are not to be accounted proud , but rather very discreet , in their reserves . Some playhouse beauties do wisely to be seen at a distance , and to have the lamps twinkle betwixt them and the spectators .</p>
   <p>But now Cæsar , who , though he were none of the greatest soldiers , was certainly the greatest traveller , of a prince , that had ever been , ( for which Virgil so dexterously compliments him , Æneid , vi . ) takes a voyage to Egypt , and , having happily finished the war , reduces that mighty kingdom into the form of a province , over which he appointed Gallus his lieutenant . This is the same person to whom Virgil addresses his Tenth Pastoral ; changing , in compliance to his request , his purpose of limiting them to the number of the Muses . The praises of this Gallus took up a considerable part of the Fourth Book of the Georgics , according to the general consent of antiquity : but Cæsar would have it put out ; and yet the seam in the poem is still to be discerned ; and the matter of Aristæus 's recovering his bees might have been dispatched in less compass , without fetching the causes so far , or interesting so many gods and goddesses in that affair . Perhaps some readers may be inclined to think this , though very much laboured , not the most entertaining part of that work ; so hard it is for the greatest masters to paint against their inclination . But Cæsar was contented , that he should be mentioned in the last Pastoral , because it might be taken for a satirical sort of commendation ; and the character he there stands under , might help to excuse his cruelty , in putting an old servant to death for no very great crime .</p>
   <p>And now having ended , as he begins his Georgics , with solemn mention of Cæsar , ( an argument of his devotion to him ,) he begins his Æneïs , according to the common account , being now turned of forty . But that work had been , in truth , the subject of much earlier meditation . Whilst he was working upon the first book of it , this passage , so very remarkable in history , fell out , in which Virgil had a great share .</p>
   <p>Cæsar , about this time , either cloyed with glory , or terrified by the example of his predecessor , or to gain the credit of moderation with the people , or possibly to feel the pulse of his friends , deliberated whether he should retain the sovereign power , or restore the commonwealth . Agrippa , who was a very honest man , but whose view was of no great extent , advised him to the latter ; but Mæcenas , who had thoroughly studied his master 's temper , in an eloquent oration gave contrary advice . That emperor was too politic to commit the oversight of Cromwell , in a deliberation something resembling this . Cromwell had never been more desirous of the power , than he was afterwards of the title , of king ; and there was nothing in which the heads of the parties , who were all his creatures , would not comply with him ; but , by too vehement allegation of arguments against it , he , who had outwitted every body besides , at last outwitted himself by too deep dissimulation ; for his council , thinking to make their court by assenting to his judgment , voted unanimously for him against his inclination ; which surprised and troubled him to such a degree , that , as soon as he had got into his coach , he fell into a swoon .<span type="note_anchor">[ 276 ]</span>But Cæsar knew his people better ; and , his council being thus divided , he asked Virgil 's advice . Thus a poet had the honour of determining the greatest point that ever was in debate , betwixt the son-in-law and favourite of Cæsar . Virgil delivered his opinion in words to this effect :</p>
   <p>“ The change of a popular into an absolute government has generally been of very ill consequence ; for , betwixt the hatred of the people and injustice of the prince , it , of necessity , comes to pass , that they live in distrust , and mutual apprehensions . But , if the commons knew a just person , whom they entirely confided in , it would be for the advantage of all parties , that such a one should be their sovereign ; wherefore , if you shall continue to administer justice impartially , as hitherto you have done , your power will prove safe to yourself , and beneficial to mankind . ” This excellent sentence , which seems taken out of Plato , ( with whose writings the grammarians were not much acquainted , and therefore cannot reasonably be suspected of forgery in this matter ,) contains the true state of affairs at that time : for the commonwealth maxims were now no longer practicable ; the Romans had only the haughtiness of the old commonwealth left , without one of its virtues . And this sentence we find , almost in the same words , in the First Book of the “ Æneïs , ” which at this time he was writing ; and one might wonder that none of his commentators have taken notice of it . He compares a tempest to a popular insurrection , as Cicero had compared a sedition to a storm , a little before :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Ac veluti , magno in populo , cum sæpe coorta est</l>
     <l n="2">Seditio , sævitque animis ignobile vulgus ,</l>
     <l n="3">Jamque faces , et saxa volant ; furor arma ministrat :</l>
     <l n="4">Tum pietate gravem ac meritis si forte virum quem</l>
     <l n="5">Conspexere , silent , arrectisque auribus adstant :</l>
     <l n="6">Ille regit dictis animos , et pectora mulcet .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Piety and merit were the two great virtues which Virgil every where attributes to Augustus , and in which that prince , at least politicly , if not so truly , fixed his character , as appears by the Marmor Ancyr . and several of his medals . Franshemius , the learned supplementor of Livy , has inserted this relation into his history ; nor is there any good reason , why Ruæus should account it fabulous . The title of a poet in those days did not abate , but heighten , the character of the gravest senator . Virgil was one of the best and wisest men of his time , and in so popular esteem , that one hundred thousand Romans rose when he came into the theatre , and paid him the same respect they used to Cæsar himself , as Tacitus assures us . And , if Augustus invited Horace to assist him in writing his letters , ( and every body knows that the “ Rescripta Imperatorum ” were the laws of the empire ,) Virgil might well deserve a place in the cabinet-council .</p>
   <p>And now he prosecutes his “ Æneïs , ” which had anciently the title of the “ Imperial Poem , ” or “ Roman History , ” and deservedly : for , though he were too artful a writer to set down events in exact historical order , for which Lucan is justly blamed ; yet are all the most considerable affairs and persons of Rome comprised in this poem . He deduces the history of Italy from before Saturn to the reign of King Latinus ; and reckons up the successors of Æneas , who reigned at Alba , for the space of three hundred years , down to the birth of Romulus ; describes the persons and principal exploits of all the kings , to their expulsion , and the settling of the commonwealth . After this , he touches promiscuously the most remarkable occurrences at home and abroad , but insists more particularly upon the exploits of Augustus ; insomuch that , though this assertion may appear at first a little surprising , he has in his works deduced the history of a considerable part of the world from its original , through the fabulous and heroic ages , through the monarchy and commonwealth of Rome , for the space of four thousand years , down to within less than forty of our Saviour 's time , of whom he has preserved a most illustrious prophecy . Besides this , he points at many remarkable passages of history under feigned names : the destruction of Alba and Veii , under that of Troy ; the star Venus , which , Varro says , guided Æneas in his voyage to Italy , in that verse ,</p>
   <p>Matre deâ monstrante viam .</p>
   <p>Romulus 's lance taking root , and budding , is described in that passage concerning Polydorus , Æneïd , iii .</p>

   <p>The stratagem of the Trojans boring holes in their ships , and sinking them , lest the Latins should burn them , under that fable of their being transformed into sea-nymphs ; and therefore the ancients had no such reason to condemn that fable as groundless and absurd . Cocles swimming the river Tyber , after the bridge was broken down behind him , is exactly painted in the four last verses of the ninth book , under the character of Turnus : Marius hiding himself in the morass of Minturnæ , under the person of Sinon :</p>

   <p>seem originally made upon Pompey the Great . He seems to touch the imperious and intriguing humour of the Empress Livia , under the character of Juno . The irresolute and weak Lepidus is well represented under the person of King Latinus ; Augustus with the character of Pont . Max . under that of Æneas ; and the rash courage ( always unfortunate in Virgil ) of Marc Antony , in Turnus ; the railing eloquence of Cicero in his “ Philippics ” is well imitated in the oration of Drances ; the dull faithful Agrippa , under the person of Achates ; accordingly this character is flat : Achates kills but one man , and himself receives one slight wound , but neither says nor does any thing very considerable in the whole poem . Curio , who sold his country for about two hundred thousand pounds , is stigmatized in that verse ,—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Vendidit hic auro patriam , dominumque potentem</l>
     <l n="2">Imposuit .</l>

   <p>Livy relates , that , presently after the death of the two Scipios in Spain , when Martius took upon him the command , a blazing meteor shone around his head , to the astonishment of his soldiers . Virgil transfers this to Æneas :</p>
   <p>Lætasque vomunt duo tempora flammas .</p>
   <p>It is strange , that the commentators have not taken notice of this . Thus the ill omen which happened a little before the battle of Thrasymen , when some of the centurions ’ lances took fire miraculously , is hinted in the like accident which befel Acestes , before the burning of the Trojan fleet in Sicily . The reader will easily find many more such instances . In other writers , there is often well-covered ignorance ; in Virgil , concealed learning .</p>
   <p>His silence of some illustrious persons is no less worth observation . He says nothing of Scævola , because he attempted to assassinate a king , though a declared enemy ; nor of the younger Brutus ; for he effected what the other endeavoured ; nor of the younger Cato , because he was an implacable enemy of Julius Cæsar ; nor could the mention of him be pleasing to Augustus ; and that passage ,</p>
   <p>His dantem jura Catonem ——</p>
   <p>may relate to his office , as he was a very severe censor . Nor would he name Cicero , when the occasion of mentioning him came full in his way , when he speaks of Catiline ; because he afterwards approved the murder of Cæsar , though the plotters were too wary to trust the orator with their design . Some other poets knew the art of speaking well ; but Virgil , beyond this , knew the admirable secret , of being eloquently silent . Whatsoever was most curious in Fabius Pictor , Cato the elder , Varro , in the Egyptian antiquities , in the form of sacrifice , in the solemnities of making peace and war , is preserved in this poem . Rome is still above ground , and flourishing in Virgil . And all this he performs with admirable brevity . The “ Æneïs ” was once near twenty times bigger than he left it ; so that he spent as much time in blotting out , as some moderns have done in writing whole volumes . But not one book has his finishing strokes . The sixth seems one of the most perfect , the which , after long entreaty , and sometimes threats , of Augustus , he was at last prevailed upon to recite . This fell out about four years before his own death : that of Marcellus , whom Cæsar designed for his successor , happened a little before this recital : Virgil therefore , with his usual dexterity , inserted his funeral panegyric in those admirable lines , beginning ,</p>
   <p>O nate , ingentem luctum ne quære tuorum , &amp; c .</p>
   <p>His mother , the excellent Octavia , the best wife of the worst husband that ever was , to divert her grief , would be of the auditory . The poet artificially deferred the naming Marcellus , till their passions were raised to the highest ; but the mention of it put both her and Augustus into such a passion of weeping , that they commanded him to proceed no further . Virgil answered , that he had already ended that passage . Some relate , that Octavia fainted away ; but afterwards she presented the poet with two thousand one hundred pounds , odd money : a round sum for twenty-seven verses ; but they were Virgil 's . Another writer says , that , with a royal magnificence , she ordered him massy plate , unweighed , to a great value .</p>
   <p>And now he took up a resolution of travelling into Greece , there to set the last hand to this work ; proposing to devote the rest of his life to philosophy , which had been always his principal passion . He justly thought it a foolish figure for a grave man to be overtaken by death , whilst he was weighing the cadence of words , and measuring verses , unless necessity should constrain it , from which he was well secured by the liberality of that learned age . But he was not aware , that , whilst he allotted three years for the revising of his poem , he drew bills upon a failing bank : for , unhappily meeting Augustus at Athens , he thought himself obliged to wait upon him into Italy ; but , being desirous to see all he could of the Greek antiquities , he fell into a languishing distemper at Megara . This , neglected at first , proved mortal . The agitation of the vessel ( for it was now autumn , near the time of his birth ,) brought him so low , that he could hardly reach Brindisi . In his sickness , he frequently , and with great importunity , called for his scrutoir , that he might burn his “ Æneïs : ” but , Augustus interposing by his royal authority , he made his last will , ( of which something shall be said afterwards ;) and , considering probably how much Homer had been disfigured by the arbitrary compilers of his works , obliged Tucca and Varius to add nothing , nor so much as fill up the breaks he left in his poem . He ordered that his bones should be carried to Naples , in which place he had passed the most agreeable part of his life . Augustus , not only as executor and friend , but according to the duty of the Pontifex Maximus , when a funeral happened in his family , took care himself to see the will punctually executed . He went out of the world with all that calmness of mind with which the ancient writer of his life says he came into it ; making the inscription of his monument himself ; for he began and ended his poetical compositions with an epitaph . And this he made , exactly according to the law of his master Plato on such occasions , without the least ostentation :</p>

    <head>He was of a very swarthy complexion , which might proceed from the southern extraction of his father ; tall and wide-shouldered , so that he may be thought to have described himself under the character of Musæus , whom he calls the best of poets —</head>

   <p>His sickliness , studies , and the troubles he met with , turned his hair gray before the usual time . He had a hesitation in his speech , as many other great men ; it being rarely found that a very fluent elocution , and depth of judgment , meet in the same person : his aspect and behaviour rustic and ungraceful ; and this defect was not likely to be rectified in the place where he first lived , nor afterwards , because the weakness of his stomach would not permit him to use his exercises . He was frequently troubled with the head-ach , and spitting of blood ; spare of diet , and hardly drank any wine . Bashful to a fault ; and , when people crowded to see him , he would slip into the next shop , or by-passage , to avoid them . As this character could not recommend him to the fair sex , he seems to have as little consideration for them as Euripides himself . There is hardly the character of one good woman to be found in his poems : he uses the word mulier but once in the whole “ Æneïs , ” then too by way of contempt , rendering literally a piece of a verse out of Homer . In his “ Pastorals , ” he is full of invectives against love : in the “ Georgics , ” he appropriates all the rage of it to the females . He makes Dido , who never deserved that character , lustful and revengeful to the utmost degree , so as to die devoting her lover to destruction ; so changeable , that the Destinies themselves could not fix the time of her death ; but Iris , the emblem of inconstancy , must determine it . Her sister is something worse .<span type="note_anchor">[ 278 ]</span>He is so far from passing such a compliment upon Helen , as the grave old counsellor in Homer does , after nine years ’ war , when , upon the sight of her , he breaks out into this rapture , in the presence of king Priam :</p>

   <p>Virgil is so far from this complaisant humour , that his hero falls into an unmanly and ill-timed deliberation , whether he should not kill her in a church ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 279 ]</span>which directly contradicts what Deiphobus says of her , Æneid vi ., in that place where every body tells the truth . He transfers the dogged silence of Ajax 's ghost to that of Dido ; though that be no very natural character to an injured lover , or a woman . He brings in the Trojan matrons setting their own fleet on fire , and running afterwards , like witches on their sabbat , into the woods . He bestows indeed some ornaments on the character of Camilla ; but soon abates his favour , by calling her aspera and horrenda virgo : he places her in the front of the line for an ill omen of the battle , as one of the ancients has observed . We may observe , on this occasion , it is an art peculiar to Virgil , to intimate the event by some preceding accident . He hardly ever describes the rising of the sun , but with some circumstance which fore-signifies the fortune of the day . For instance , when Æneas leaves Africa and Queen Dido , he thus describes the fatal morning :</p>
   <p>Tithoni croceum linquens Aurora cubile .</p>
   <p>[ And , for the remark , we stand indebted to the curious pencil of Pollio . ] The Mourning Fields ( Æneid vi . ) are crowded with ladies of a lost reputation : hardly one man gets admittance ; and that is Cæneus , for a very good reason . Latinus 's queen is turbulent and ungovernable , and at last hangs herself : and the fair Lavinia is disobedient to the oracle , and to the king , and looks a little flickering after Turnus . I wonder at this the more , because Livy represents her as an excellent person , and who behaved herself with great wisdom in her regency during the minority of her son ; so that the poet has done her wrong , and it reflects on her posterity . His goddesses make as ill a figure : Juno is always in a rage , and the Fury of heaven ; Venus grows so unreasonably confident , as to ask her husband to forge arms for her bastard son , which were enough to provoke one of a more phlegmatic temper than Vulcan was . Notwithstanding all this raillery of Virgil 's , he was certainly of a very amorous disposition , and has described all that is most delicate in the passion of love : but he conquered his natural inclination by the help of philosophy , and refined it into friendship , to which he was extremely sensible . The reader will admit of or reject the following conjecture , with the free leave of the writer , who will be equally pleased either way . Virgil had too great an opinion of the influence of the heavenly bodies : and , as an ancient writer says , he was born under the sign of Virgo ; with which nativity he much pleased himself , and would exemplify her virtues in his life . Perhaps it was thence that he took his name of Virgil and Parthenias , which does not necessarily signify base-born . Donatus and Servius , very good grammarians , give a quite contrary sense of it . He seems to make allusion to this original of his name in that passage ,</p>

   <p>thus placing him betwixt Justice and Power , and in a neighbour mansion to his own ; for Virgil supposed souls to ascend again to their proper and congenial stars . Being therefore of this humour , it is no wonder that he refused the embraces of the beautiful Plotia , when his indiscreet friend almost threw her into his arms .</p>
   <p>But however he stood affected to the ladies , there is a dreadful accusation brought against him for the most unnatural of all vices , which , by the malignity of human nature , has found more credit in latter times than it did near his own . This took not its rise so much from the “ Alexis , ” in which pastoral there is not one immodest word , as from a sort of ill-nature , that will not let any one be without the imputation of some vice ; and principally because he was so strict a follower of Socrates and Plato . In order , therefore , to his vindication , I shall take the matter a little higher .</p>
   <p>The Cretans were anciently much addicted to navigation , insomuch that it became a Greek proverb , ( though omitted , I think , by the industrious Erasmus ,) a Cretan that does not know the sea . Their neighbourhood gave them occasion of frequent commerce with the Phoenicians , that accursed people , who infected the western world with endless superstitions , and gross immoralities . From them it is probable that the Cretans learned this infamous passion , to which they were so much addicted , that Cicero remarks , in his book “ De Rep . ” that it was “ a disgrace for a young gentleman to be without lovers . ” Socrates , who was a great admirer of the Cretan constitutions , set his excellent wit to find out some good cause and use of this evil inclination , and therefore gives an account , wherefore beauty is to be loved , in the following passage ; for I will not trouble the reader , weary perhaps already , with a long Greek quotation . “ There is but one eternal , immutable , uniform beauty ; in contemplation of which , our sovereign happiness does consist : and therefore a true lover considers beauty and proportion as so many steps and degrees , by which he may ascend from the particular to the general , from all that is lovely of feature , or regular in proportion , or charming in sound , to the general fountain of all perfection . And if you are so much transported with the sight of beautiful persons , as to wish neither to eat nor drink , but pass your whole life in their conversation ; to what ecstasy would it raise you to behold the original beauty , not filled up with flesh and blood , or varnished with a fading mixture of colours , and the rest of mortal trifles and fooleries , but separate , unmixed , uniform , and divine , ” &amp; c. Thus far Socrates , in a strain much beyond the “ Socrate Chrétien ” of Mr Balzac : and thus that admirable man loved his Phædon , his Charmides , and Theætetus ; and thus Virgil loved his Alexander and Cebes , under the feigned name of Alexis : he received them illiterate , but returned them to their masters , the one a good poet , and the other an excellent grammarian . And , to prevent all possible misinterpretations , he warily inserted , into the liveliest episode in the whole “ Æneïs , ” these words ,</p>
   <p>Nisus amore pio pueri ——</p>
   <p>and , in the sixth , “ Quique pii vates . ” He seems fond of the words , castus , pius , virgo , and the compounds of it : and sometimes stretches the use of that word further than one would think he reasonably should have done , as when he attributes it to Pasiphaë herself .</p>
   <p>Another vice he is taxed with , is avarice , because he died rich ; and so indeed he did , in comparison of modern wealth . His estate amounts to near seventy-five thousand pounds of our money : but Donatus does not take notice of this as a thing extraordinary ; nor was it esteemed so great a matter , when the cash of a great part of the world lay at Rome . Antony himself bestowed at once two thousand acres of land , in one of the best provinces of Italy , upon a ridiculous scribbler , who is named by Cicero and Virgil . A late cardinal used to purchase ill flattery at the expence of a hundred thousand crowns a year . But , besides Virgil 's other benefactors , he was much in favour with Augustus , whose bounty to him had no limits , but such as the modesty of Virgil prescribed to it . Before he had made his own fortune , he settled his estate upon his parents and brothers ; sent them yearly large sums , so that they lived in great plenty and respect ; and , at his death , divided his estate betwixt duty and gratitude , leaving one half to his relations , and the other to Mæcenas , to Tucca , and Varius , and a considerable legacy to Augustus , who had introduced a politic fashion of being in every body 's will ; which alone was a fair revenue for a prince . Virgil shows his detestation of this vice , by placing in the front of the damned those who did not relieve their relations and friends ; for the Romans hardly ever extended their liberality further ; and therefore I do not remember to have met , in all the Latin poets , one character so noble as that short one in Homer :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">#—— Philos d ’ ên anthrôpoisi ;</l>
     <l n="2">Pantas gar phileesken .#</l>
   </lg>
   <p>On the other hand , he gives a very advanced place in Elysium to good patriots , &amp; c. observing , in all his poem , that rule so sacred among the Romans , “ That there should be no art allowed , which did not tend to the improvement of the people in virtue . ” And this was the principle too of our excellent Mr Waller , who used to say , that he would raze any line out of his poems , which did not imply some motive to virtue : but he was unhappy in the choice of the subject of his admirable vein in poetry . The Countess of Carlisle was the Helen of her country . There is nothing in Pagan philosophy more true , more just , and regular , than Virgil 's ethics ; and it is hardly possible to sit down to the serious perusal of his works , but a man shall rise more disposed to virtue and goodness , as well as most agreeably entertained ; the contrary to which disposition may happen sometimes upon the reading of Ovid , of Martial , and several other second-rate poets . But of the craft and tricking part of life , with which Homer abounds , there is nothing to be found in Virgil ; and therefore Plato , who gives the former so many good words , perfumes , crowns , but at last complimentally banishes him his commonwealth , would have entreated Virgil to stay with him , ( if they had lived in the same age ,) and entrusted him with some important charge in his government . Thus was his life as chaste as his style ; and those who can critic his poetry , can never find a blemish in his manners ; and one would rather wish to have that purity of mind , which the satirist himself attributes to him ; that friendly disposition , and evenness of temper , and patience , which he was master of in so eminent a degree , than to have the honour of being author of the “ Æneïs , ” or even of the “ Georgics ” themselves .</p>
   <p>Having therefore so little relish for the usual amusements of the world , he prosecuted his studies without any considerable interruption , during the whole course of his life , which one may reasonably conjecture to have been something longer than fifty-two years ; and therefore it is no wonder that he became the most general scholar that Rome ever bred , unless some one should except Varro . Besides the exact knowledge of rural affairs , he understood medicine , to which profession he was designed by his parents . A curious florist ; on which subject one would wish he had writ , as he once intended : so profound a naturalist , that he has solved more phenomena of nature upon sound principles , than Aristotle in his Physics : he studied geometry , the most opposite of all sciences to a poetic genius , and beauties of a lively imagination ; but this promoted the order of his narrations , his propriety of language , and clearness of expression , for which he was justly called the pillar of the Latin tongue . This geometrical spirit was the cause , that , to fill up a verse , he would not insert one superfluous word ; and therefore deserves that character which a noble and judicious writer has given him , “ That he never says too little , nor too much . "[ 280 ] Nor could any one ever fill up the verses he left imperfect . There is one supplied near the beginning of the First Book . Virgil left the verse thus ,</p>

   <p>He was so good a geographer , that he has not only left us the finest description of Italy that ever was , but , besides , was one of the few ancients who knew the true system of the earth , its being inhabited round about , under the torrid zone , and near the poles . Metrodorus , in his five books of the “ Zones , ” justifies him from some exceptions made against him by astronomers . His rhetoric was in such general esteem , that lectures were read upon it in the reign of Tiberius , and the subject of declamations taken out of him . Pollio himself , and many other ancients , commented him . His esteem degenerated into a kind of superstition . The known story of Mr Cowley is an instance of it<span type="note_anchor">[ 281 ]</span>. But the sortes Virgilianæ were condemned by St Austin , and other casuists . Abienus , by an odd design , put all Virgil and Livy into iambic verse ; and the pictures of those two were hung in the most honourable place of public libraries ; and the design of taking them down , and destroying Virgil 's works , was looked upon as one of the most extravagant amongst the many brutish phrenzies of Caligula .</p>

   <p>The Life of Virgil has usually been ascribed to William Walsh , whose merits as a minor poet are now forgotten , but who still lives in the grateful strains of Pope , whose juvenile essays he encouraged , as well as in the encomium of Dryden , whom he patronised in age and adversity .

     <l n="2">And tell thy soul , she should have fled before .</l>

   <p>PASTORALS .</p>
   <p>TO</p>
   <p>THE RIGHT HONOURABLE</p>
   <p>HUGH ,</p>
   <p>LORD CLIFFORD ,</p>
   <p>BARON OF CHUDLEIGH .<span type="note_anchor">[ 282 ]</span></p>
   <p>MY LORD ,</p>
   <p>I have found it not more difficult to translate Virgil , than to find such patrons as I desire for my translation . For , though England is not wanting in a learned nobility , yet such are my unhappy circumstances , that they have confined me to a narrow choice .<span type="note_anchor">[ 283 ]</span>To the greater part I have not the honour to be known ; and to some of them I cannot show at present , by any public act , that grateful respect which I shall ever bear them in my heart . Yet I have no reason to complain of fortune , since , in the midst of that abundance , I could not possibly have chosen better , than the worthy son of so illustrious a father . He was the patron of my manhood , when I flourished in the opinion of the world ; though with small advantage to my fortune , till he awakened the remembrance of my royal master . He was that Pollio , or that Varus ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 284 ]</span>who introduced me to Augustus : and , though he soon dismissed himself from state affairs , yet , in the short time of his administration , he shone so powerfully upon me , that , like the heat of a Russian summer , he ripened the fruits of poetry in a cold climate , and gave me wherewithal to subsist , at least , in the long winter which succeeded . What I now offer to your lordship , is the wretched remainder of a sickly age , worn out with study , and oppressed by fortune ; without other support than the constancy and patience of a Christian . You , my lord , are yet in the flower of your youth , and may live to enjoy the benefits of the peace which is promised Europe : I can only hear of that blessing ; for years , and , above all things , want of health , have shut me out from sharing in the happiness . The poets , who condemn their Tantalus to hell , had added to his torments , if they had placed him in Elysium , which is the proper emblem of my condition . The fruit and the water may reach my lips , but cannot enter ; and , if they could , yet I want a palate as well as a digestion . But it is some kind of pleasure to me , to please those whom I respect ; and I am not altogether out of hope , that these Pastorals of Virgil may give your lordship some delight , though made English by one who scarce remembers that passion which inspired my author when he wrote them . These were his first essay in poetry , if the “ Ceiris "[ 285 ] was not his : and it was more excusable in him to describe love when he was young , than for me to translate him when I am old . He died at the age of fifty-two ; and I began this work in my great climacteric . But , having perhaps a better constitution than my author , I have wronged him less , considering my circumstances , than those who have attempted him before , either in our own , or any modern language . And , though this version is not void of errors , yet it comforts me , that the faults of others are not worth finding . Mine are neither gross nor frequent in those Eclogues , wherein my master has raised himself above that humble style in which pastoral delights , and which , I must confess , is proper to the education and converse of shepherds : for he found the strength of his genius betimes , and was , even in his youth , preluding to his “ Georgics ” and his “ Æneïs . ” He could not forbear to try his wings , though his pinions were not hardened to maintain a long laborious flight ; yet sometimes they bore him to a pitch as lofty as ever he was able to reach afterwards . But , when he was admonished by his subject to descend , he came down gently , circling in the air , and singing , to the ground ; like a lark , melodious in her mounting , and continuing her song till she alights , still preparing for a higher flight at her next sally , and tuning her voice to better music . The fourth , the sixth , and the eighth Pastorals , are clear evidences of this truth . In the three first , he contains himself within his bounds : but , addressing to Pollio , his great patron , and himself no vulgar poet , he no longer could restrain the freedom of his spirit , but began to assert his native character , which is sublimity — putting himself under the conduct of the same Cumæan Sibyl , whom afterwards he gave for a guide to his Æneas . It is true , he was sensible of his own boldness ; and we know it by the paulo majora , which begins his fourth Eclogue . He remembered , like young Manlius , that he was forbidden to engage ; but what avails an express command to a youthful courage , which presages victory in the attempt ?<span type="note_anchor">[ 286 ]</span>Encouraged with success , he proceeds farther in the sixth , and invades the province of philosophy . And , notwithstanding that Phoebus had forewarned him of singing wars , as he there confesses , yet he presumed , that the search of nature was as free to him as to Lucretius , who , at his age , explained it according to the principles of Epicurus . In his eighth Eclogue , he has innovated nothing ; the former part of it being the complaint and despair of a forsaken lover ; the latter , a charm of an enchantress , to renew a lost affection . But the complaint perhaps contains some topics which are above the condition of his persons ; and our author seems to have made his herdsmen somewhat too learned for their profession : the charms are also of the same nature ; but both were copied from Theocritus , and had received the applause of former ages in their original .</p>
   <p>There is a kind of rusticity in all those pompous verses ; somewhat of a holiday shepherd strutting in his country buskins . The like may be observed both in the “ Pollio ” and the “ Silenus , ” where the similitudes are drawn from the woods and meadows . They seem to me to represent our poet betwixt a farmer and a courtier , when he left Mantua for Rome , and drest himself in his best habit to appear before his patron , somewhat too fine for the place from whence he came , and yet retaining part of its simplicity . In the ninth Pastoral , he collects some beautiful passages , which were scattered in Theocritus , which he could not insert into any of his former Eclogues , and yet was unwilling they should be lost . In all the rest , he is equal to his Sicilian master , and observes , like him , a just decorum both of the subject and the persons ; as particularly in the third Pastoral , where one of his shepherds describes a bowl , or mazer , curiously carved :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">In medio duo signa : Conon , et quis fuit alter ,</l>
     <l n="2">Descripsit radio , totum qui gentibus orbem ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>He remembers only the name of Conon , and forgets the other on set purpose . Whether he means Anaximander , or Eudoxus , I dispute not ; but he was certainly forgotten , to show his country swain was no great scholar .</p>
   <p>After all , I must confess , that the boorish dialect of Theocritus has a secret charm in it , which the Roman language cannot imitate , though Virgil has drawn it down as low as possibly he could ; as in the cujum pecus , and some other words , for which he was so unjustly blamed by the bad critics of his age , who could not see the beauties of that merum rus , which the poet described in those expressions . But Theocritus may justly be preferred as the original , without injury to Virgil , who modestly contents himself with the second place , and glories only in being the first who transplanted pastoral into his own country , and brought it there to bear as happily as the cherry-trees which Lucullus brought from Pontus .</p>
   <p>Our own nation has produced a third poet in this kind , not inferior to the two former : for the “ Shepherd 's Kalendar ” of Spenser is not to be matched in any modern language , not even by Tasso 's “ Aminta , ” which infinitely transcends Guarini 's “ Pastor Fido , ” as having more of nature in it , and being almost wholly clear from the wretched affectation of learning . I will say nothing of the “ Piscatory Eclogues , ” because no modern Latin can bear criticism .<span type="note_anchor">[ 287 ]</span>It is no wonder , that , rolling down , through so many barbarous ages , from the spring of Virgil , it bears along with it the filth and ordures of the Goths and Vandals . Neither will I mention Monsieur Fontenelle , the living glory of the French . It is enough for him to have excelled his master Lucian , without attempting to compare our miserable age with that of Virgil , or Theocritus . Let me only add , for his reputation ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">—— Si Pergama dextrâ</l>
     <l n="2">Defendi possint , etiam hâc defensa fuissent .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But Spenser , being master of our northern dialect , and skilled in Chaucer 's English , has so exactly imitated the Doric of Theocritus , that his love is a perfect image of that passion which God infused into both sexes , before it was corrupted with the knowledge of arts , and the ceremonies of what we call good manners .</p>
   <p>My lord , I know to whom I dedicate ; and could not have been induced , by any motive , to put this part of Virgil , or any other , into unlearned hands . You have read him with pleasure , and , I dare say , with admiration , in the Latin , of which you are a master . You have added to your natural endowments , which , without flattery , are eminent , the superstructures of study , and the knowledge of good authors . Courage , probity , and humanity , are inherent in you . These virtues have ever been habitual to the ancient house of Cumberland , from whence you are descended , and of which our chronicles make so honourable mention in the long wars betwixt the rival families of York and Lancaster . Your forefathers have asserted the party which they chose till death , and died for its defence in the fields of battle . You have , besides , the fresh remembrance of your noble father , from whom you never can degenerate :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">—— Nec imbellem feroces</l>
     <l n="2">Progenerant aquilæ columbam .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It being almost morally impossible for you to be other than you are by kind , I need neither praise nor incite your virtue . You are acquainted with the Roman history , and know , without my information , that patronage and clientship always descended from the fathers to the sons , and that the same plebeian houses had recourse to the same patrician line which had formerly protected them , and followed their principles and fortunes to the last . So that I am your lordship 's by descent , and part of your inheritance . And the natural inclination which I have to serve you , adds to your paternal right ; for I was wholly yours from the first moment when I had the happiness and honour of being known to you . Be pleased therefore to accept the rudiments of Virgil 's poetry , coarsely translated , I confess , but which yet retain some beauties of the author , which neither the barbarity of our language , nor my unskilfulness , could so much sully , but that they appear sometimes in the dim mirror which I hold before you . The subject is not unsuitable to your youth , which allows you yet to love , and is proper to your present scene of life . Rural recreations abroad , and books at home , are the innocent pleasures of a man who is early wise , and gives Fortune no more hold of him , than of necessity he must . It is good , on some occasions , to think before-hand as little as we can ; to enjoy as much of the present as will not endanger our futurity ; and to provide ourselves of the virtuoso 's saddle , which will be sure to amble , when the world is upon the hardest trot . What I humbly offer to your lordship , is of this nature . I wish it pleasant , and am sure it is innocent . May you ever continue your esteem for Virgil , and not lessen it for the faults of his translator ; who is , with all manner of respect and sense of gratitude ,</p>

I do not pretend to judge of the purity of the style of Sannazarius , but surely the poetry is often beautiful . I doubt if Dryden was acquainted with the poems of Phineas Fletcher , whom honest Isaac Walton calls , “ an excellent divine , and an excellent angler , and the author of excellent Piscatory Eclogues . ” They contain many passages fully equal to Spenser .</p>
   <p>PREFACE</p>
   <p>TO THE</p>
   <p>PASTORALS ,</p>
   <p>WITH</p>
   <p>A SHORT DEFENCE</p>
   <p>OF</p>
   <p>VIRGIL ,</p>
   <p>AGAINST SOME OF THE REFLECTIONS OF</p>
   <p>MONSIEUR FONTENELLE .</p>
   <p>BY WILLIAM WALSH , ESQ .</p>
   <p>As the writings of greatest antiquity are in verse , so , of all sorts of poetry , pastorals seem the most ancient ; being formed upon the model of the first innocence and simplicity , which the moderns , better to dispense themselves from imitating , have wisely thought fit to treat as fabulous , and impracticable . And yet they , by obeying the unsophisticated dictates of nature , enjoyed the most valuable blessings of life ; a vigorous health of body , with a constant serenity and freedom of mind ; whilst we , with all our fanciful refinements , can scarcely pass an autumn without some access of a fever , or a whole day , not ruffled by some unquiet passion . He was not then looked upon as a very old man , who reached to a greater number of years , than in these times an ancient family can reasonably pretend to ; and we know the names of several , who saw and practised the world for a longer space of time , than we can read the account of in any one entire body of history . In short , they invented the most useful arts , pasturage , tillage , geometry , writing , music , astronomy , &amp; c. whilst the moderns , like extravagant heirs made rich by their industry , ungratefully deride the good old gentleman who left them the estate . It is not therefore to be wondered at , that pastorals are fallen into disesteem , together with that fashion of life , upon which they were grounded . And methinks I see the reader already uneasy at this part of Virgil , counting the pages , and posting to the “ Æneïs : ” so delightful an entertainment is the very relation of public mischief and slaughter now become to mankind . And yet Virgil passed a much different judgment on his own works : he valued most this part , and his “ Georgics , ” and depended upon them for his reputation with posterity ; but censures himself in one of his letters to Augustus , for meddling with heroics , the invention of a degenerating age . This is the reason that the rules of pastoral are so little known , or studied . Aristotle , Horace , and the Essay of Poetry , take no notice of it ; and Monsieur Boileau , one of the most accurate of the moderns , because he never loses the ancients out of his sight , bestows scarce half a page on it .</p>
   <p>It is the design therefore of the few following pages , to clear this sort of writing from vulgar prejudices ; to vindicate our author from some unjust imputations ; to look into some of the rules of this sort of poetry , and enquire what sort of versification is most proper for it ; in which point we are so much inferior to the ancients , that this consideration alone were enough to make some writers think as they ought , that is meanly , of their own performances .</p>
   <p>As all sorts of poetry consist in imitation , pastoral is the imitation of a Shepherd , considered under that character . It is requisite therefore to be a little informed of the condition and qualification of these shepherds .</p>
   <p>One of the ancients has observed truly , but satirically enough , that , “ Mankind is the measure of every thing . ” And thus , by a gradual improvement of this mistake , we come to make our own age and country the rule and standard of others , and ourselves at last the measure of them all . We figure the ancient countrymen like our own , leading a painful life in poverty and contempt , without wit , or courage , or education . But men had quite different notions of these things , for the first four thousand years of the world . Health and strength were then in more esteem than the refinements of pleasure ; and it was accounted a great deal more honourable to till the ground , or keep a flock of sheep , than to dissolve in wantonness and effeminating sloth .<span type="note_anchor">[ 288 ]</span>Hunting has now an idea of quality joined to it , and is become the most important business in the life of a gentleman ; anciently it was quite otherways .<span type="note_anchor">[ 289 ]</span>Mr Fleury has severely remarked , that this extravagant passion for hunting is a strong proof of our Gothic extraction , and shews an affinity of humour with the savage Americans . The barbarous Franks and other Germans , ( having neither corn nor wine of their own growth ,) when they passed the Rhine , and possessed themselves of countries better cultivated , left the tillage of the land to the old proprietors ; and afterwards continued to hazard their lives as freely for their diversion , as they had done before for their necessary subsistence . The English gave this usage the sacred stamp of fashion ; and from hence it is that most of our terms of hunting are French .<span type="note_anchor">[ 290 ]</span>The reader will , I hope , give me his pardon for my freedom on this subject , since an ill accident , occasioned by hunting , has kept England in pain , these several months together , for one of the best and greatest peers<span type="note_anchor">[ 291 ]</span>which she has bred for some ages ; no less illustrious for civil virtues and learning , than his ancestors were for all their victories in France .</p>
   <p>But there are some prints still left of the ancient esteem for husbandry , and their plain fashion of life , in many of our surnames , and in the escutcheons of the most ancient families , even those of the greatest kings , the roses , the lilies , the thistle , &amp; c. It is generally known , that one of the principal causes of the deposing of Mahomet the Fourth , was , that he would not allot part of the day to some manual labour , according to the law of Mahomet , and ancient practice of his predecessors . He that reflects on this , will be the less surprised to find that Charlemagne , eight hundred years ago , ordered his children to be instructed in some profession ; and , eight hundred years yet higher , that Augustus wore no clothes but such as were made by the hands of the empress and her daughters ; and Olympias did the same for Alexander the Great . Nor will he wonder , that the Romans , in great exigency , sent for their dictator from the plough , whose whole estate was but of four acres ; too little a spot now for the orchard , or kitchen-garden , of a private gentleman . It is commonly known , that the founders of three the most renowned monarchies in the world were shepherds ; and the subject of husbandry has been adorned by the writings and labour of more than twenty kings . It ought not therefore to be matter of surprise to a modern writer , that kings , the shepherds of the people in Homer , laid down their first rudiments in tending their mute subjects ; nor that the wealth of Ulysses consisted in flocks and herds , the intendants over which were then in equal esteem with officers of state in latter times . And therefore Eumæus is called # dios hyphorbos # in Homer ; not so much because Homer was a lover of a country life , to which he rather seems averse , but by reason of the dignity and greatness of his trust , and because he was the son of a king , stolen away , and sold by the Phoenician pirates ; which the ingenious Mr Cowley seems not to have taken notice of . Nor will it seem strange , that the master of the horse to king Latinus , in the ninth Æneïd , was found in the homely employment of cleaving blocks , when news of the first skirmish betwixt the Trojans and Latins was brought to him .</p>
   <p>Being therefore of such quality , they cannot be supposed so very ignorant and unpolished : the learning and good-breeding of the world was then in the hands of such people . He who was chosen by the consent of all parties to arbitrate so delicate an affair as , which was the fairest of the three celebrated beauties of heaven — he who had the address to debauch away Helen from her husband , her native country , and from a crown — understood what the French call by the too soft name of galanterie ; he had accomplishments enough , how ill use soever he made of them . It seems , therefore , that M. Fontenelle had not duly considered the matter , when he reflected so severely upon Virgil , as if he had not observed the laws of decency in his Pastorals , in making shepherds speak to things beside their character , and above their capacity . He stands amazed , that shepherds should thunder out , as he expresses himself , the formation of the world , and that too according to the system of Epicurus . “ In truth , ” says he , page 176 , “ I cannot tell what to make of this whole piece , ( the sixth Pastoral . ) I can neither comprehend the design of the author , nor the connection of the parts . First come the ideas of philosophy , and presently after those incoherent fables , &amp; c . ” To expose him yet more , he subjoins , “ It is Silenus himself who makes all this absurd discourse . Virgil says indeed , that he had drank too much the day before ; perhaps the debauch hung in his head when he composed this poem , ” &amp; c. Thus far M. Fontenelle , who , to the disgrace of reason , as himself ingenuously owns , first built his house , and then studied architecture ; I mean , first composed his Eclogues , and then studied the rules . In answer to this , we may observe , first , that this very pastoral which he singles out to triumph over , was recited by a famous player on the Roman theatre , with marvellous applause ; insomuch that Cicero , who had heard part of it only , ordered the whole to be rehearsed , and , struck with admiration of it , conferred then upon Virgil the glorious title of</p>
   <p>Magnæ spes altera Romæ .</p>
   <p>Nor is it old Donatus only who relates this ; we have the same account from another very credible and ancient author ; so that here we have the judgment of Cicero , and the people of Rome , to confront the single opinion of this adventurous critic . A man ought to be well assured of his own abilities , before he attacks an author of established reputation . If Mr Fontenelle had perused the fragments of the Phoenician antiquity , traced the progress of learning through the ancient Greek writers , or so much as consulted his learned countryman Huetius , he would have found , ( which falls out unluckily for him ,) that a Chaldæan shepherd discovered to the Egyptians and Greeks the creation of the world . And what subject more fit for such a pastoral , than that great affair which was first notified to the world by one of that profession ? Nor does it appear , ( what he takes for granted ,) that Virgil describes the original of the world according to the hypothesis of Epicurus . He was too well seen in antiquity to commit such a gross mistake ; there is not the least mention of chance in that whole passage , nor of the clinamen principiorum , so peculiar to Epicurus 's hypothesis . Virgil had not only more piety , but was of too nice a judgment to introduce a god denying the power and providence of the Deity , and singing a hymn to the atoms and blind chance . On the contrary , his description agrees very well with that of Moses ; and the eloquent commentator Dacier , who is so confident that Horace had perused the sacred history , might with greater reason have affirmed the same thing of Virgil ; for , besides that famous passage in the sixth Æneïd , ( by which this may be illustrated ,) where the word principio is used in the front of both by Moses and Virgil , and the seas are first mentioned , and the spiritus intus alit , which might not improbably , as M. Dacier would suggest , allude to the “ Spirit moving upon the face of the waters ; ” but , omitting this parallel place , the successive formation of the world is evidently described in these words ,</p>
   <p>Rerum paulatim sumere formas :</p>
   <p>And it is hardly possible to render more literally that verse of Moses , “ Let the waters be gathered into one place , and let the dry land appear , ” than in this of Virgil ,</p>
   <p>Jam durare solum , et discludere Nerea ponto .</p>
   <p>After this , the formation of the sun is described , ( exactly in the Mosaical order ,) and , next , the production of the first living creatures , and that too in a small number , ( still in the same method ,)</p>
   <p>Rara per ignotos errent animalia montes .</p>
   <p>And here the foresaid author would probably remark , that Virgil keeps more exactly to the Mosaic system , than an ingenious writer , who will by no means allow mountains to be coeval with the world . Thus much will make it probable at least , that Virgil had Moses in his thoughts rather than Epicurus , when he composed this poem . But it is further remarkable , that this passage was taken from a song attributed to Apollo , who himself , too , unluckily had been a shepherd ; and he took it from another yet more ancient , composed by the first inventor of music , and at that time a shepherd too ; and this is one of the noblest fragments of Greek antiquity . And , because I cannot suppose the ingenious M. Fontenelle one of their number , who pretend to censure the Greeks , without being able to distinguish Greek from Ephesian characters , I shall here set down the lines from which Virgil took this passage , though none of the commentators have observed it :</p>
   <p>#—— eratê d ’ hoi hespeto phônê , Krainôn athanatous te theous , kai gaian eremnên , Hôs ta prôta genonto , kai hôs lache moiran hekastos #, &amp; c .</p>
   <p>Thus Linus too began his poem , as appears by a fragment of it preserved by Diogenes Laertius ; and the like may be instanced in Musæus himself ; so that our poet here , with great judgment , as always , follows the ancient custom of beginning their more solemn songs with the creation , and does it too most properly under the person of a shepherd . And thus the first and best employment of poetry was , to compose hymns in honour of the great Creator of the universe .</p>
   <p>Few words will suffice to answer his other objections . He demands why those several transformations are mentioned in that poem :— And is not fable then the life and soul of poetry ? Can himself assign a more proper subject of pastoral than the Saturnia regna , the age and scene of this kind of poetry ? What theme more fit for the song of a god , or to imprint religious awe , than the omnipotent power of transforming the species of creatures at their pleasure ? Their families lived in groves , near the clear springs ; and what better warning could be given to the hopeful young shepherds , than that they should not gaze too much into the liquid dangerous looking-glass , for fear of being stolen by the water-nymphs , that is , falling and being drowned , as Hylas was ? Pasiphaë 's monstrous passion for a bull is certainly a subject enough fitted for bucolics . Can M. Fontenelle tax Silenus for fetching too far the transformation of the sisters of Phaëton into trees , when perhaps they sat at that very time under the hospitable shade of those alders and poplars — or the metamorphosis of Philomela into that ravishing bird , which makes the sweetest music of the groves ? If he had looked into the ancient Greek writers , or so much as consulted honest Servius , he would have discovered , that , under the allegory of this drunkenness of Silenus , the refinement and exaltation of men 's minds by philosophy was intended . But , if the author of these reflections can take such flights in his wine , it is almost pity that drunkenness should be a sin , or that he should ever want good store of burgundy and champaign . But indeed he seems not to have ever drank out of Silenus 's tankard , when he composed either his Critique or Pastorals .</p>
   <p>His censure on the fourth seems worse grounded than the other . It is entitled , in some ancient manuscripts , the “ History of the Renovation of the World . ” He complains , that he “ cannot understand what is meant by those many figurative expressions : ” but , if he had consulted the younger Vossius 's dissertation on this Pastoral , or read the excellent oration of the emperor Constantine , made French by a good pen of their own , he would have found there the plain interpretation of all those figurative expressions ; and , withal , very strong proofs of the truth of the Christian religion ; such as converted heathens , as Valerianus , and others . And , upon account of this piece , the most learned of all the Latin fathers calls Virgil a Christian , even before Christianity . Cicero takes notice of it in his books of Divination ; and Virgil probably had put it in verse a considerable time before the edition of his Pastorals . Nor does he appropriate it to Pollio , or his son , but complimentally dates it from his consulship ; and therefore some one , who had not so kind thoughts of M. Fontenelle as I , would be inclined to think him as bad a Catholic as critic in this place .</p>
   <p>But , in respect to some books he has wrote since , I pass by a great part of this , and shall only touch briefly some of the rules of this sort of poem .</p>
   <p>The first is , that an air of piety , upon all occasions , should be maintained in the whole poem . This appears in all the ancient Greek writers , as Homer , Hesiod , Aratus , &amp; c. And Virgil is so exact in the observation of it , not only in this work , but in his “ Æneïs ” too , that a celebrated French writer taxes him for permitting Æneas to do nothing without the assistance of some god . But by this it appears , at least , that M. St Evremont is no Jansenist .</p>
   <p>M. Fontenelle seems a little defective in this point : he brings in a pair of shepherdesses disputing very warmly , whether Victoria be a goddess or a woman . Her great condescension and compassion , her affability and goodness , ( none of the meanest attributes of the divinity ,) pass for convincing arguments , that she could not possibly be a goddess .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Les Déesses , toûjours fières et méprisantes ,</l>
     <l n="2">Ne rassureroient point les bergères tremblantes</l>
     <l n="3">Par d'obligeans discours , des souris gracieux .</l>
     <l n="4">Mais tu l'as vu : cette auguste personne ,</l>
     <l n="5">Qui vient de paroître en ces lieux ,</l>
     <l n="6">Prend soin de rassurer au moment qu'elle étonne ;</l>
     <l n="7">Sa bonté descendant sans peine jusqu ’ à nous .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In short , she has too many divine perfections to be a deity , and therefore she is a mortal ; which was the thing to be proved . It is directly contrary to the practice of all ancient poets , as well as to the rules of decency and religion , to make such odious preferences . I am much surprised , therefore , that he should use such an argument as this :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Cloris , as-tu vu des déesses</l>
     <l n="2">Avoir un air si facile et si doux ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Was not Aurora , and Venus , and Luna , and I know not how many more of the heathen deities , too easy of access to Tithonus , to Anchises , and to Endymion ? Is there any thing more sparkish and better-humoured than Venus 's accosting her son in the deserts of Libya ? or than the behaviour of Pallas to Diomedes , one of the most perfect and admirable pieces of all the Iliads ; where she condescends to raillé him so agreeably ; and , notwithstanding her severe virtue , and all the ensigns of majesty with which she so terribly adorns herself , condescends to ride with him in his chariot ? But the Odysseys are full of greater instances of condescension than this .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">This brings to mind that famous passage of Lucan , in which he prefers</l>

   <p>Another rule is , that the characters should represent that ancient innocence , and unpractised plainness , which was then in the world . P. Rapin has gathered many instances of this out of Theocritus and Virgil ; and the reader can do it as well as himself . But M. Fontenelle transgressed this rule , when he hid himself in the thicket to listen to the private discourse of the two shepherdesses . This is not only ill breeding at Versailles ; the Arcadian shepherdesses themselves would have set their dogs upon one for such an unpardonable piece of rudeness .</p>
   <p>A third rule is , that there should be some ordonnance , some design , or little plot , which may deserve the title of a pastoral scene . This is everywhere observed by Virgil , and particularly remarkable in the first Eclogue , the standard of all pastorals . A beautiful landscape presents itself to your view ; a shepherd , with his flock around him , resting securely under a spreading beech , which furnished the first food to our ancestors ; another in a quite different situation of mind and circumstances ; the sun setting ; the hospitality of the more fortunate shepherd , &amp; c. And here M. Fontenelle seems not a little wanting .</p>
   <p>A fourth rule , and of great importance in this delicate sort of writing , is , that there be choice diversity of subjects ; that the Eclogue , like a beautiful prospect , should charm by its variety . Virgil is admirable in this point , and far surpasses Theocritus , as he does everywhere , when judgment and contrivance have the principal part . The subject of the first Pastoral is hinted above .</p>
   <p>The Second contains the love of Corydon for Alexis , and the seasonable reproach he gives himself , that he left his vines half pruned , ( which , according to the Roman rituals , derived a curse upon the fruit that grew upon it ,) whilst he pursued an object undeserving his passion .</p>
   <p>The Third , a sharp contention of two shepherds for the prize of poetry .</p>
   <p>The Fourth contains the discourse of a shepherd comforting himself , in a declining age , that a better was ensuing .</p>
   <p>The Fifth , a lamentation for a dead friend , the first draught of which is probably more ancient than any of the pastorals now extant ; his brother being at first intended ; but he afterwards makes his court to Augustus , by turning it into an apotheosis of Julius Cæsar .</p>
   <p>The Sixth is the Silenus .</p>
   <p>The Seventh , another poetical dispute , first composed at Mantua .</p>
   <p>The Eighth is the description of a despairing lover , and a magical charm .</p>
   <p>He sets the Ninth after all these , very modestly , because it was particular to himself ; and here he would have ended that work , if Gallus had not prevailed upon him to add one more in his favour .</p>
   <p>Thus curious was Virgil in diversifying his subjects . But M. Fontenelle is a great deal too uniform : begin where you please , the subject is still the same . We find it true what he says of himself ,</p>
   <p>Toûjours , toûjours de l'amour .</p>
   <p>He seems to take pastorals and love-verses for the same thing . Has human nature no other passion ? Does not fear , ambition , avarice , pride , a capriccio of honour , and laziness itself , often triumph over love ? But this passion does all , not only in pastorals , but in modern tragedies too . A hero can no more fight , or be sick , or die , than he can be born , without a woman . But dramatics have been composed in compliance to the humour of the age , and the prevailing inclination of the great , whose example has a more powerful influence , not only in the little court behind the scenes , but on the great theatre of the world . However , this inundation of love-verses is not so much an effect of their amorousness , as of immoderate self-love ; this being the only sort of poetry , in which the writer can , not only without censure , but even with commendation , talk of himself . There is generally more of the passion of Narcissus , than concern for Chloris and Corinna , in this whole affair . Be pleased to look into almost any of those writers , and you shall meet everywhere that eternal Moi , which the admirable Pascal so judiciously condemns . Homer can never be enough admired for this one so particular quality , that he never speaks of himself , either in the Iliad or the Odysseys : and , if Horace had never told us his genealogy , but left it to the writer of his life , perhaps he had not been a loser by it . This consideration might induce those great critics , Varius and Tucca , to raze out the four first verses of the “ Æneïs , ” in great measure , for the sake of that unlucky Ille ego . But extraordinary geniuses have a sort of prerogative , which may dispense them from laws , binding to subject wits . However , the ladies have the less reason to be pleased with those addresses , of which the poet takes the greater share to himself . Thus the beau presses into their dressing-room ; but it is not so much to adore their fair eyes , as to adjust his own steenkirk and peruke , and set his countenance in their glass .</p>
   <p>A fifth rule ( which one may hope will not be contested ) is , that the writer should show in his compositions some competent skill of the subject matter , that which makes the character of persons introduced . In this , as in all other points of learning , decency , and oeconomy of a poem , Virgil much excels his master Theocritus . The poet is better skilled in husbandry than those that get their bread by it . He describes the nature , the diseases , the remedies , the proper places , and seasons , of feeding , of watering their flocks ; the furniture , diet , the lodging and pastimes , of his shepherds . But the persons brought in by M. Fontenelle are shepherds in masquerade , and handle their sheep-hook as aukwardly as they do their oaten reed . They saunter about with their chers moutons ; but they relate as little to the business in hand , as the painter 's dog , or a Dutch ship , does to the history designed . One would suspect some of them , that , instead of leading out their sheep into the plains of Mont-Brison and Marcilli , to the flowery banks of Lignon , or the Charante , they are driving directly à la boucherie , to make money of them . I hope hereafter M. Fontenelle will chuse his servants better .</p>
   <p>A sixth rule is , that , as the style ought to be natural , clear , and elegant , it should have some peculiar relish of the ancient fashion of writing . Parables in those times were frequently used , as they are still by the eastern nations ; philosophical questions , ænigmas , &amp; c .; and of this we find instances in the sacred writings , in Homer , contemporary with king David , in Herodotus , in the Greek tragedians . This piece of antiquity is imitated by Virgil with great judgment and discretion . He has proposed one riddle , which has never yet been solved by any of his commentators . Though he knew the rules of rhetoric as well as Cicero himself , he conceals that skill in his Pastorals , and keeps close to the character of antiquity . Nor ought the connections and transitions to be very strict and regular ; this would give the Pastorals an air of novelty ; and of this neglect of exact connections , we have instances in the writings of the ancient Chineses , of the Jews and Greeks , in Pindar , and other writers of dithyrambics , in the choruses of Æschylus , Sophocles , and Euripides . If M. Fontenelle and Ruæus had considered this , the one would have spared his critique of the sixth , and the other , his reflections upon the ninth Pastoral . The over-scrupulous care of connections makes the modern compositions oftentimes tedious and flat : and by the omission of them it comes to pass , that the Pensées of the incomparable M. Pascal , and perhaps of M. Bruyère , are two of the most entertaining books which the modern French can boast of . Virgil , in this point , was not only faithful to the character of antiquity , but copies after Nature herself . Thus a meadow , where the beauties of the spring are profusely blended together , makes a more delightful prospect , than a curious parterre of sorted flowers in our gardens : and we are much more transported with the beauty of the heavens , and admiration of their Creator , in a clear night , when we behold stars of all magnitudes promiscuously moving together , than if those glorious lights were ranked in their several orders , or reduced into the finest geometrical figures .</p>
   <p>Another rule omitted by P. Rapin , as some of his are by me , ( for I do not design an entire treatise in this preface ,) is , that not only the sentences should be short and smart , ( upon which account he justly blames the Italian and French , as too talkative ,) but that the whole piece should be so too . Virgil transgressed this rule in his first Pastorals , ( I mean those which he composed at Mantua ,) but rectified the fault in his riper years . This appears by the Culex , which is as long as five of his Pastorals put together . The greater part of those he finished have less than a hundred verses ; and but two of them exceed that number . But the “ Silenus , ” which he seems to have designed for his master-piece , in which he introduces a god singing , and he , too , full of inspiration , ( which is intended by that ebriety , which M. Fontenelle so unreasonably ridicules ,) though it go through so vast a field of matter , and comprises the mythology of near two thousand years , consists but of fifty lines ; so that its brevity is no less admirable , than the subject matter , the noble fashion of handling it , and the deity speaking . Virgil keeps up his characters in this respect too , with the strictest decency : for poetry and pastime was not the business of men 's lives in those days , but only their seasonable recreation after necessary labours . And therefore the length of some of the modern Italian and English compositions is against the rules of this kind of poesy .</p>
   <p>I shall add something very briefly , touching the versification of Pastorals , though it be a mortifying consideration to the moderns . Heroic verse , as it is commonly called , was used by the Greeks in this sort of poem , as very ancient and natural ; lyrics , iambics , &amp; c. being invented afterwards : but there is so great a difference in the numbers of which it may be compounded , that it may pass rather for a genus , than species , of verse . Whosoever shall compare the numbers of the three following verses , will quickly be sensible of the truth of this observation :</p>
   <p>Tityre , tu patulæ recubans sub tegmine fagi —</p>
   <p>the first of the Georgics ,</p>
   <p>Quid faciat lætas segetes , quo sidere terram —</p>
   <p>and of the Æneïs ,</p>
   <p>Arma , virumque cano , Trojæ qui primus ab oris .</p>
   <p>The sound of the verses is almost as different as the subjects . But the Greek writers of Pastoral usually limited themselves to the example of the first ; which Virgil found so exceedingly difficult , that he quitted it , and left the honour of that part to Theocritus . It is indeed probable , that what we improperly call rhyme , is the most ancient sort of poetry ; and learned men have given good arguments for it ; and therefore a French historian commits a gross mistake , when he attributes that invention to a king of Gaul , as an English gentleman does , when he makes a Roman emperor the inventor of it . But the Greeks , who understood fully the force and power of numbers , soon grew weary of this childish sort of verse , as the younger Vossius justly calls it , and therefore those rhyming hexameters , which Plutarch observes in Homer himself , seem to be the remains of a barbarous age . Virgil had them in such abhorrence , that he would rather make a false syntax , than what we call a rhyme . Such a verse as this ,</p>
   <p>Vir , precor , uxori , frater succurre sorori ,</p>
   <p>was passable in Ovid ; but the nicer ears in Augustus 's court could not pardon Virgil for</p>
   <p>At regina pyrâ ....</p>
   <p>so that the principal ornament of modern poetry was accounted deformity by the Latins and Greeks . It was they who invented the different terminations of words , those happy compositions , those short monosyllables , those transpositions for the elegance of the sound and sense , which are wanting so much in modern languages . The French sometimes crowd together ten or twelve monosyllables into one disjointed verse . They may understand the nature of , but cannot imitate , those wonderful spondees of Pythagoras , by which he could suddenly pacify a man that was in a violent transport of anger ; nor those swift numbers of the priests of Cybele , which had the force to enrage the most sedate and phlegmatic tempers . Nor can any modern put into his own language the energy of that single poem of Catullus ,</p>
   <p>Super alta vectus Atys , &amp; c .</p>
   <p>Latin is but a corrupt dialect of Greek ; and the French , Spanish , and Italian , a corruption of Latin ; and therefore a man might as well go about to persuade me that vinegar is a nobler liquor than wine , as that the modern compositions can be as graceful and harmonious as the Latin itself . The Greek tongue very naturally falls into iambics , and therefore the diligent reader may find six or seven-and-twenty of them in those accurate orations of Isocrates . The Latin as naturally falls into heroic ; and therefore the beginning of Livy 's History is half a hexameter , and that of Tacitus an entire one . The Roman historian<span type="note_anchor">[ 293 ]</span>, describing the glorious effort of a colonel to break through a brigade of the enemy 's , just after the defeat at Cannæ , falls , unknowingly , into a verse not unworthy Virgil himself —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Hæc ubi dicta dedit , stringit gladium , cuneoque</l>
     <l n="2">Facto , per medios .... &amp; c .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Ours and the French can at best but fall into blank verse , which is a fault in prose . The misfortune indeed is common to us both ; but we deserve more compassion , because we are not vain of our barbarities . As age brings men back into the state and infirmities of childhood , upon the fall of their empire , the Romans doted into rhyme , as appears sufficiently by the hymns of the Latin church ; and yet a great deal of the French poetry does hardly deserve that poor title . I shall give an instance out of a poem which had the good luck to gain the prize in 1685 ; for the subject deserved a nobler pen :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Tous les jours ce grand roy , des autres roys l ’ exemple ,</l>
     <l n="2">S'ouvre un nouveau chemin au faîte de ton temple , &amp; c .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The judicious Malherbe exploded this sort of verse near eighty years ago . Nor can I forbear wondering at that passage of a famous academician , in which he , most compassionately , excuses the ancients for their not being so exact in their compositions as the modern French , because they wanted a dictionary , of which the French are at last happily provided . If Demosthenes and Cicero had been so lucky as to have had a dictionary , and such a patron as cardinal Richelieu , perhaps they might have aspired to the honour of Balzac 's legacy of ten pounds , Le prix de l'éloquence .</p>
   <p>On the contrary , I dare assert , that there are hardly ten lines in either of those great orators , or even in the catalogue of Homer 's ships , which are not more harmonious , more truly rhythmical , than most of the French or English sonnets ; and therefore they lose , at least , one half of their native beauty by translation .</p>
   <p>I cannot but add one remark on this occasion ,— that the French verse is oftentimes not so much as rhyme , in the lowest sense ; for the childish repetition of the same note cannot be called music . Such instances are infinite , as in the forecited poem :</p>
   <p>épris trophée caché mépris Orphée cherché .</p>
   <p>M. Boileau himself has a great deal of this # monotonia #, not by his own neglect , but purely by the faultiness and poverty of the French tongue . M. Fontenelle at last goes into the excessive paradoxes of M. Perrault , and boasts of the vast number of their excellent songs , preferring them to the Greek and Latin . But an ancient writer , of as good credit , has assured us , that seven lives would hardly suffice to read over the Greek odes ; but a few weeks would be sufficient , if a man were so very idle as to read over all the French . In the mean time , I should be very glad to see a catalogue of but fifty of theirs with</p>
   <p>Exact propriety of word and thought .<span type="note_anchor">[ 294 ]</span></p>
   <p>Notwithstanding all the high encomiums and mutual gratulations which they give one another , ( for I am far from censuring the whole of that illustrious society , to which the learned world is much obliged ,) after all those golden dreams at the Louvre , that their pieces will be as much valued , ten or twelve ages hence , as the ancient Greek or Roman , I can no more get it into my head that they will last so long , than I could believe the learned Dr H —— k [ of the Royal Society ,] if he should pretend to show me a butterfly , that had lived a thousand winters .</p>
   <p>When M. Fontenelle wrote his Eclogues , he was so far from equalling Virgil , or Theocritus , that he had some pains to take before he could understand in what the principal beauty and graces of their writings do consist .</p>
   <p>Cum mortuis non nisi larvæ luctantur .</p>
   <p>FOOTNOTES :</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 288 ]</span>There is a great deal of cant in this ; there was just the same distinction in manners and knowledge between the clowns of Mantua and the courtiers of Augustus , as there is between persons of the same rank in modern times .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 289 ]</span>Hunting was as much an exercise of the Roman youths as of our own ; and this might be easily proved from Virgil , were it not a well known fact . It was the sport with which Dido entertained the Trojans ; and the wish of Ascanius upon the occasion , was worthy of a Frank , or any other German .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 290 ]</span>This is indistinctly expressed ; but if the critic means to say , that the terms of hunting were put into French as the most fashionable language , he is mistaken . The hunting phrases still in use , are handed down to us from the Anglo-Norman barons , in whose time French was the only language spoken among those who were entitled to participate in an amusement to which the nobility claimed an exclusive privilege .</p>

   <p>PASTORAL I .</p>
   <p>OR ,</p>
   <p>TITYRUS AND MELIBOEUS .</p>
   <p>ARGUMENT .</p>
   <p>The occasion of the First Pastoral was this : When Augustus had settled himself in the Roman empire , that he might reward his veteran troops for their past service , he distributed among them all the lands that lay about Cremona and Mantua ; turning out the right owners for having sided with his enemies . Virgil was a sufferer among the rest , who afterwards recovered his estate by Mæcenas 's intercession ; and , as an instance of his gratitude , composed the following Pastoral , where he sets out his own good fortune in the person of Tityrus , and the calamities of his Mantuan neighbours in the character of Meliboeus .</p>
   <lg type="poem">

     <l n="1">Beneath the shade which beechen boughs diffuse ,</l>
     <l n="2">You , Tityrus , entertain your sylvan muse .</l>
     <l n="3">Round the wide world in banishment we roam ,</l>
     <l n="4">Forced from our pleasing fields and native home ;</l>
     <l n="5">While , stretched at ease , you sing your happy loves ,</l>

     <l n="3">The tender firstlings of my woolly breed</l>
     <l n="4">Shall on his holy altar often bleed .</l>

    <head>ALEXIS .</head>
    <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>The commentators can by no means agree on the person of Alexis , but are all of opinion that some beautiful youth is meant by him , to whom Virgil here makes love , in Corydon 's language and simplicity . His way of courtship is wholly pastoral : he complains of the boy 's coyness ; recommends himself for his beauty and skill in piping ; invites the youth into the country , where he promises him the diversions of the place , with a suitable present of nuts and apples . But when he finds nothing will prevail , he resolves to quit his troublesome amour , and betake himself again to his former business .</head>

     <l n="77">Ah , Corydon ! ah , poor unhappy swain !</l>
     <l n="78">Alexis will thy homely gifts disdain :</l>
     <l n="79">Nor , should'st thou offer all thy little store ,</l>
     <l n="80">Will rich Iolas yield , but offer more .</l>
     <l n="81">What have I done , to name that wealthy swain ?</l>
     <l n="82">So powerful are his presents , mine so mean !</l>
     <l n="83">The boar , amidst my crystal streams , I bring ;</l>

     <l n="99">Cool breezes now the raging heats remove :</l>
     <l n="100">Ah , cruel heaven , that made no cure for love !</l>
     <l n="101">I wish for balmy sleep , but wish in vain ;</l>
     <l n="102">Love has no bounds in pleasure , or in pain .</l>
     <l n="103">What frenzy , shepherd , has thy soul possessed ?</l>
     <l n="104">Thy vineyard lies half pruned , and half undressed .</l>
     <l n="105">Quench , Corydon , thy long unanswered fire !</l>

     <l n="107">On willow twigs employ thy weaving care ,</l>
     <l n="108">And find an easier love , though not so fair .</l>

   <p>Damoetas and Menalcas , after some smart strokes of country raillery , resolve to try who has the most skill at song ; and accordingly make their neighbour , Palæmon , judge of their performances ; who , after a full hearing of both parties , declares himself unfit for the decision of so weighty a controversy , and leaves the victory undetermined .</p>

     <l n="16">The father banished virtue shall restore ,</l>

     <l n="2">Incipe , parve puer , risu cognoscere matrem , &amp; c .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>I have translated the passage to this sense — that the infant , smiling on his mother , singles her out from the rest of the company about him . Erythræus , Bembus , and Joseph Scaliger , are of this opinion . Yet they and I may be mistaken ; for , immediately after , we find these words , cui non risere parentes , which imply another sense , as if the parents smiled on the new-born infant ; and that the babe on whom they vouchsafed not to smile , was born to ill fortune : for they tell a story , that , when Vulcan , the only son of Jupiter and Juno , came into the world , he was so hard-favoured , that both his parents frowned on him , and Jupiter threw him out of heaven : he fell on the island Lemnos , and was lame ever afterwards . The last line of the Pastoral seems to justify this sense :</p>
   <p>Nec Deus hunc mensâ , Dea nec dignata cubili est .</p>
   <p>For , though he married Venus , yet his mother Juno was not present at the nuptials to bless them ; as appears by his wife 's incontinence . They say also , that he was banished from the banquets of the gods . If so , that punishment could be of no long continuance ; for Homer makes him present at their feasts , and composing a quarrel betwixt his parents , with a bowl of nectar . The matter is of no great consequence ; and therefore I adhere to my translation , for these two reasons : first , Virgil has his following line ,</p>
   <p>Matri longa decem tulerunt fastidia menses ,</p>
   <p>as if the infant 's smiling on his mother was a reward to her for bearing him ten months in her body , four weeks longer than the usual time . Secondly , Catullus is cited by Joseph Scaliger , as favouring this opinion , in his Epithalamium of Manlius Torquatus :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Torquatus , volo , parvolus ,</l>
     <l n="2">Matris e gremio suæ</l>
     <l n="3">Porrigens teneras manus ,</l>
     <l n="4">Dulce rideat ad patrem , &amp; c .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>What if I should steer betwixt the two extremes , and conclude , that the infant , who was to be happy , must not only smile on his parents , but also they on him ? For Scaliger notes , that the infants who smiled not at their birth , were observed to be # agelastoi #, or sullen , ( as I have translated it ,) during all their life ; and Servius , and almost all the modern commentators , affirm , that no child was thought fortunate , on whom his parents smiled not at his birth . I observe , farther , that the ancients thought the infant , who came into the world at the end of the tenth month , was born to some extraordinary fortune , good or bad . Such was the birth of the late prince of Condé 's father , of whom his mother was not brought to bed , till almost eleven months were expired after his father 's death ; yet the college of physicians at Paris concluded he was lawfully begotten . My ingenious friend , Anthony Henley , Esq . desired me to make a note on this passage of Virgil ; adding , ( what I had not read ,) that the Jews have been so superstitious , as to observe not only the first look or action of an infant , but also the first word which the parent , or any of the assistants , spoke after the birth ; and from thence they gave a name to the child , alluding to it .</p>

    <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>Two young shepherds , Chromis and Mnasylus , having been often promised a song by Silenus , chance to catch him asleep in this Pastoral ; where they bind him hand and foot , and then claim his promise . Silenus , finding they would be put off no longer , begins his song , in which he describes the formation of the universe , and the original of animals , according to the Epicurean philosophy ; and then runs through the most surprising transformations which have happened in Nature since her birth . This Pastoral was designed as a compliment to Syron the Epicurean , who instructed Virgil and Varus in the principles of that philosophy . Silenus acts as tutor , Chromis and Mnasylus as the two pupils .<span type="note_anchor">[ 299 ]</span></head>

     <l n="28">Invaded thus , for want of better bands ,</l>
     <l n="29">His garland they unstring , and bind his hands ;</l>
     <l n="30">For , by the fraudful god deluded long ,</l>
     <l n="31">They now resolve to have their promised song .</l>
     <l n="32">Ægle came in , to make their party good —</l>

     <l n="34">And , while he stares around with stupid eyes ,</l>
     <l n="35">His brows with berries , and his temples , dyes .</l>
     <l n="36">He finds the fraud , and , with a smile , demands ,</l>

     <l n="42">He raised his voice ; and soon a numerous throng</l>

     <l n="51">Fell through the mighty void , and , in their fall ,</l>
     <l n="52">Were blindly gathered in this goodly ball .</l>
     <l n="53">The tender soil then , stiffening by degrees ,</l>
     <l n="54">Shut from the bounded earth the bounding seas .</l>
     <l n="55">Then earth and ocean various forms disclose ,</l>

     <l n="60">The lofty mountains feed the savage race , }</l>
     <l n="61">Yet few , and strangers , in the unpeopled place . }</l>
     <l n="62">From thence the birth of man the song pursued ,</l>

     <l n="64">The reign of Saturn , and the golden age ;</l>
     <l n="65">Prometheus ’ theft , and Jove 's avenging rage ;</l>
     <l n="66">The cries of Argonauts for Hylas drowned ,</l>
     <l n="67">With whose repeated name the shores resound ;</l>
     <l n="68">Then mourns the madness of the Cretan queen ,—</l>
     <l n="69">Happy for her if herds had never been .</l>
     <l n="70">What fury , wretched woman , seized thy breast ?</l>
     <l n="71">The maids of Argos , ( though , with rage possessed ,</l>
     <l n="72">Their imitated lowings filled the grove ,)</l>
     <l n="73">Yet shunned the guilt of thy preposterous love ,</l>
     <l n="74">Nor sought the youthful husband of the herd , }</l>
     <l n="75">Though labouring yokes on their own necks they feared , }</l>
     <l n="76">And felt for budding horns on their smooth foreheads reared . }</l>
     <l n="77">Ah , wretched queen ! you range the pathless wood ,</l>
     <l n="78">While on a flowery bank he chews the cud ,</l>
     <l n="79">Or sleeps in shades , or through the forest roves ,</l>
     <l n="80">And roars with anguish for his absent loves .</l>
     <l n="81">“ Ye nymphs , with toils his forest-walk surround ,</l>
     <l n="82">And trace his wandering footsteps on the ground .</l>
     <l n="83">But , ah ! perhaps my passion he disdains ,</l>
     <l n="84">And courts the milky mothers of the plains .</l>
     <l n="85">We search the ungrateful fugitive abroad ,</l>
     <l n="86">While they at home sustain his happy load . ”</l>
     <l n="87">He sung the lover 's fraud ; the longing maid ,</l>
     <l n="88">With golden fruit , like all the sex , betrayed ;</l>
     <l n="89">The sisters mourning for their brother 's loss ;</l>
     <l n="90">Their bodies hid in barks , and furred with moss ;</l>
     <l n="91">How each a rising alder now appears ,</l>
     <l n="92">And o'er the Po distils her gummy tears :</l>
     <l n="93">Then sung , how Gallus , by a Muse 's hand ,</l>
     <l n="94">Was led and welcomed to the sacred strand ;</l>
     <l n="95">The senate rising to salute their guest ;</l>
     <l n="96">And Linus thus their gratitude expressed :—</l>
     <l n="97">“ Receive this present , by the Muses made ,</l>
     <l n="98">The pipe on which the Ascræan pastor played ;</l>

     <l n="101">Sing thou , on this , thy Phoebus ; and the wood</l>
     <l n="102">Where once his fane of Parian marble stood :</l>
     <l n="103">On this his ancient oracles rehearse ,</l>
     <l n="104">And with new numbers grace the god of verse . ”</l>
     <l n="105">Why should I sing the double Scylla 's fate ?</l>
     <l n="106">The first by love transformed , the last by hate —</l>
     <l n="107">A beauteous maid above ; but magic arts</l>
     <l n="108">With barking dogs deformed her nether parts :</l>
     <l n="109">What vengeance on the passing fleet she poured ,</l>
     <l n="110">The master frighted , and the mates devoured .</l>
     <l n="111">Then ravished Philomel the song exprest ;</l>
     <l n="112">The crime revealed ; the sisters ’ cruel feast :</l>
     <l n="113">And how in fields the lapwing Tereus reigns ,</l>
     <l n="114">The warbling nightingale in woods complains ;</l>
     <l n="115">While Procne makes on chimney-tops her moan ,</l>
     <l n="116">And hovers o'er the palace once her own .</l>
     <l n="117">Whatever songs besides the Delphian god</l>
     <l n="118">Had taught the laurels , and the Spartan flood ,</l>
     <l n="119">Silenus sung : the vales his voice rebound ,</l>
     <l n="120">And carry to the skies the sacred sound .</l>
     <l n="121">And now the setting sun had warned the swain }</l>
     <l n="122">To call his counted cattle from the plain : }</l>
     <l n="123">Yet still the unwearied sire pursues the tuneful strain , }</l>
     <l n="124">Till , unperceived , the heavens with stars were hung ,</l>
     <l n="125">And sudden night surprised the yet unfinished song .</l>

    <head>MELIBOEUS .</head>
    <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>Meliboeus here gives us the relation of a sharp poetical contest between Thyrsis and Corydon , at which he himself and Daphnis were present ; who both declared for Corydon .</head>
     <l n="1">Beneath a holm , repaired two jolly swains ,</l>
     <l n="2">( Their sheep and goats together grazed the plains ,)</l>
     <l n="3">Both young Arcadians , both alike inspired</l>
     <l n="4">To sing , and answer as the song required .</l>
     <l n="5">Daphnis , as umpire , took the middle seat ,</l>
     <l n="6">And fortune thither led my weary feet ;</l>
     <l n="7">For , while I fenced my myrtles from the cold ,</l>
     <l n="8">The father of my flock had wandered from the fold .</l>
     <l n="9">Of Daphnis I inquired : he , smiling , said ,</l>
     <l n="10">“ Dismiss your fear ; ” and pointed where he fed :</l>
     <l n="11">“ And , if no greater cares disturb your mind ,</l>
     <l n="12">Sit here with us , in covert of the wind .</l>
     <l n="13">Your lowing heifers , of their own accord ,</l>
     <l n="14">At watering time will seek the neighbouring ford .</l>
     <l n="15">Here wanton Mincius winds along the meads ,</l>
     <l n="16">And shades his happy banks with bending reeds .</l>
     <l n="17">And see , from yon old oak that mates the skies ,</l>
     <l n="18">How black the clouds of swarming bees arise . ”</l>
     <l n="19">What should I do ? nor was Alcippe nigh ,</l>
     <l n="20">Nor absent Phyllis could my care supply ,</l>
     <l n="21">To house , and feed by hand my weaning lambs ,</l>
     <l n="22">And drain the strutting udders of their dams .</l>
     <l n="23">Great was the strife betwixt the singing swains ;</l>
     <l n="24">And I preferred my pleasure to my gains .</l>
     <l n="25">Alternate rhyme the ready champions chose :</l>

   <p>When Virgil , by the favour of Augustus , had recovered his patrimony near Mantua , and went in hope to take possession , he was in danger to be slain by Arius the centurion , to whom those lands were assigned by the Emperor , in reward of his service against Brutus and Cassius . This Pastoral therefore is filled with complaints of his hard usage ; and the persons introduced are the bailiff of Virgil , Moeris , and his friend Lycidas .</p>

    <head>GALLUS .</head>
    <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>Gallus , a great patron of Virgil , and an excellent poet , was very deeply in love with one Cytheris , whom he calls Lycoris , and who had forsaken him for the company of a soldier . The poet therefore supposes his friend Gallus retired , in his height of melancholy , into the solitudes of Arcadia , ( the celebrated scene of pastorals ,) where he represents him in a very languishing condition , with all the rural deities about him , pitying his hard usage , and condoling his misfortune .</head>

     <l n="29">Menalcas , wet with beating winter mast .</l>
     <l n="30">Wondering , they asked from whence arose thy flame .</l>
     <l n="31">Yet more amazed , thy own Apollo came .</l>
     <l n="32">Flushed were his cheeks , and glowing were his eyes :</l>
     <l n="33">“ Is she thy care ? is she thy care ? ” he cries .</l>
     <l n="34">“ Thy false Lycoris flies thy love and thee , }</l>
     <l n="35">And , for thy rival , tempts the raging sea , }</l>

     <l n="37">Silvanus came : his brows a country crown</l>
     <l n="38">Of fennel , and of nodding lilies , drown .</l>
     <l n="39">Great Pan arrived ; and we beheld him too ,</l>
     <l n="40">His cheeks and temples of vermilion hue .</l>
     <l n="41">“ Why , Gallus , this immoderate grief ? ” he cried ,</l>
     <l n="42">“ Think'st thou that love with tears is satisfied ?</l>
     <l n="43">The meads are sooner drunk with morning dews ,</l>
     <l n="44">The bees with flowery shrubs , the goats with browze . ”</l>
     <l n="45">Unmoved , and with dejected eyes , he mourned :</l>
     <l n="46">He paused , and then these broken words returned :—</l>
     <l n="47">“ ‘ Tis past ; and pity gives me no relief :</l>
     <l n="48">But you , Arcadian swains , shall sing my grief ,</l>
     <l n="49">And on your hills my last complaints renew :</l>

     <l n="106">Gallus , for whom my holy flames renew ,</l>
     <l n="107">Each hour , and every moment rise in view ;</l>
     <l n="108">As alders , in the spring , their boles extend ,</l>
     <l n="109">And heave so fiercely , that the bark they rend .</l>

     <l n="110">Now let us rise ; for hoarseness oft invades</l>
     <l n="111">The singer 's voice , who sings beneath the shades .</l>
     <l n="112">From juniper unwholesome dews distil , }</l>
     <l n="113">That blast the sooty corn , the withering herbage kill . }</l>
     <l n="114">Away , my goats , away ! for you have browzed your fill . }</l>
