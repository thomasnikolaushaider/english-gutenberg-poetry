    <head>ST. JULIAN 'S PRAYER</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">TO charms and philters , secret spells and prayers ,</l>
     <l n="2">How many round attribute all their cares !</l>
     <l n="3">In these howe'er I never can believe ,</l>
     <l n="4">And laugh at follies that so much deceive .</l>
     <l n="5">Yet with the beauteous FAIR , ‘ tis very true ,</l>
     <l n="6">These WORDS , as SACRED VIRTUES , oft they view ;</l>
     <l n="7">The spell and philter wonders work in love</l>
     <l n="8">Hearts melt with charms supposed from pow'rs above !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">MY aim is now to have recourse to these ,</l>
     <l n="10">And give a story that I trust will please ,</l>
     <l n="11">In which Saint Julian 's prayer , to Reynold D'Ast ,</l>
     <l n="12">Produced a benefit , good fortune classed .</l>
     <l n="13">Had he neglected to repeat the charm ,</l>
     <l n="14">Believed so thoroughly to guard from harm ,</l>
     <l n="15">He would have found his cash accounts not right ,</l>
     <l n="16">And passed assuredly a wretched night .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">ONE day , to William 's castle as he moved .</l>
     <l n="18">Three men , whose looks he very much approved ,</l>
     <l n="19">And thought such honest fellows he had round ,</l>
     <l n="20">Their like could nowhere be discovered round ;</l>
     <l n="21">Without suspecting any thing was wrong ,</l>
     <l n="22">The three , with complaisance and fluent tongue ,</l>
     <l n="23">Saluted him in humble servile style ,</l>
     <l n="24">And asked , ( the minutes better to beguile ,)</l>
     <l n="25">If they might bear him company the way ;</l>
     <l n="26">The honour would be great , and no delay ;</l>
     <l n="27">Besides , in travelling ‘ tis safer found ,</l>
     <l n="28">And far more pleasant , when the party 's round ;</l>
     <l n="29">So many robbers through the province range ,</l>
     <l n="30">( Continued they ) ‘ tis wonderfully strange ,</l>
     <l n="31">The prince should not these villains more restrain ;</l>
     <l n="32">But there :— bad MEN will somewhere still remain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="33">TO their proposal Reynold soon agreed ,</l>
     <l n="34">And they resolved together to proceed .</l>
     <l n="35">When ‘ bout a league the travellers had moved ,</l>
     <l n="36">Discussing freely , as they all approved ,</l>
     <l n="37">The conversation turned on spells and prayer ,</l>
     <l n="38">Their pow'r o'er worms of earth , or birds of air ;</l>
     <l n="39">To charm the wolf , or guard from thunder 's roar ,</l>
     <l n="40">And many wonderful achievements more ;</l>
     <l n="41">Besides the cures a prayer would oft produce ;</l>
     <l n="42">To man and beast it proves of sov'reign use ,</l>
     <l n="43">Far greater than from doctors e'er you 'll view ,</l>
     <l n="44">Who , with their Latin , make so much ado .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="45">IN turn , the three pretended knowledge great ,</l>
     <l n="46">And mystick facts affected to relate ,</l>
     <l n="47">While Reynold silently attention paid</l>
     <l n="48">To all the words the honest fellows said :—</l>
     <l n="49">Possess you not , said one , some secret prayer</l>
     <l n="50">To bring you aid , when dangers round you stare ?</l>
     <l n="51">To this our Reynold seriously replied ,</l>
     <l n="52">Myself , on secret spells , I do not pride ;</l>
     <l n="53">But still some WORDS I have that I repeat ,</l>
     <l n="54">Each morn I travel , that I may not meet</l>
     <l n="55">A horrid lodging where I stop at night ;</l>
     <l n="56">‘ Tis called SAINT JULIAN 'S PRAYER that I recite ,</l>
     <l n="57">And truly I have found , that when I fail</l>
     <l n="58">To say this prayer , I 've reason to bewail .</l>
     <l n="59">But rarely I neglect so good a thing ,</l>
     <l n="60">That ills averts , and may such blessings bring .</l>
     <l n="61">And have you clearly said it , sir , to day ?</l>
     <l n="62">Cried one of those he met upon his way .</l>
     <l n="63">Yes , Reynold answered . Well , replied the Wight ;</l>
     <l n="64">I 'll wage , I 'm better lodged than you to-night .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="65">‘ TWAS very cold , and darkness ‘ gan to peep ;</l>
     <l n="66">The place was distant yet , where they might sleep .</l>
     <l n="67">Perhaps , said Reynold , ‘ tis your usual care ,</l>
     <l n="68">In travelling , to say , like me , this prayer .</l>
     <l n="69">Not so , the other cried , to you I vow ,</l>
     <l n="70">Invoking saints is not my practice now ;</l>
     <l n="71">But should I lose , thenceforth I 'll them address .—</l>
     <l n="72">Said Reynold , readily I acquiesce ;</l>
     <l n="73">My life I 'd venture , should you to an inn ,</l>
     <l n="74">For , in the town , I 've neither friend nor kin ,</l>
     <l n="75">And , if you like , we 'll this exception make .</l>
     <l n="76">The other answered : Well , the bet I 'll take ;</l>
     <l n="77">Your horse and coat against my purse you wage ,</l>
     <l n="78">And , sure of gaining , readily engage .</l>
     <l n="79">Our Wight might then have thoroughly perceived ,</l>
     <l n="80">His horse was lost — no chance to be relieved .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="81">BESIDE a wood , as on the party moved ,</l>
     <l n="82">The one , who betting had so much approved ,</l>
     <l n="83">Now changed his tone , and in a surly way ,</l>
     <l n="84">Exclaimed :— Alight — you 'll find it time to pray ;</l>
     <l n="85">Let me apprize you , distant is the place ,</l>
     <l n="86">And much you 'll need Saint Julian 's special grace .</l>
     <l n="87">Come off , I tell you :— instantly they took</l>
     <l n="88">His purse , horse , clothes , and all their hands could hook</l>
     <l n="89">E'en seized his boots , and said with subtle sneer ,</l>
     <l n="90">Your feet , by walking , wo n't the worse appear ;</l>
     <l n="91">Then sought a diff'rent road by rapid flight ,</l>
     <l n="92">And , presently the knaves were out of sight ;</l>
     <l n="93">While Reynold still with stockings , drawers , and shirt ,</l>
     <l n="94">But wet to skin , and covered o'er with dirt :</l>
     <l n="95">( The wind north-east in front — as cold as clay ;)</l>
     <l n="96">In doleful dumps proceeded on his way ,</l>
     <l n="97">And justly feared , that spite of faith and prayer ,</l>
     <l n="98">He now should meet , at night , with wretched fare .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="99">HOWEVER , some pleasing hopes he still had yet ,</l>
     <l n="100">That , from his cloak-bag , he some clothes might get ;</l>
     <l n="101">For , we should note , a servant he had brought ,</l>
     <l n="102">Who in the neighbourhood a farrier sought .</l>
     <l n="103">To set a shoe upon his horse , and then</l>
     <l n="104">Should join his master on the road agen ;</l>
     <l n="105">But that , as we shall find , was not the case ,</l>
     <l n="106">And Reynold 's dire misfortune thence we trace .</l>
     <l n="107">In fact , the fellow , worthless we 'll suppose ,</l>
     <l n="108">Had viewed from far what accidents arose ,</l>
     <l n="109">Then turned aside , his safety to secure ,</l>
     <l n="110">And left his master dangers to endure ;</l>
     <l n="111">So steadily be kept upon the trot ,</l>
     <l n="112">To Castle-William , ere ‘ twas night , he got ,</l>
     <l n="113">And took the inn which had the most renown ;</l>
     <l n="114">For fare and furniture within the town ,</l>
     <l n="115">There waited Reynold 's coming at his ease ,</l>
     <l n="116">With fire and cheer that could not fail to please .</l>
     <l n="117">His master , up to neck in dirt and wet ,</l>
     <l n="118">Had num'rous difficulties o'er to get ;</l>
     <l n="119">And when the snow , in flakes obscured the air ,</l>
     <l n="120">With piercing cold and winds , he felt despair ;</l>
     <l n="121">Such ills he bore , that hanging might be thought</l>
     <l n="122">A bed of roses rather to be sought .</l>
     <l n="123">CHANCE so arranges ev'ry thing around</l>
     <l n="124">ALL good , or ALL that 's bad is solely found ;</l>
     <l n="125">When favours flow the numbers are so great ,</l>
     <l n="126">That ev'ry wish upon us seems to wait ;</l>
     <l n="127">But , if disposed , misfortunes to bestow ;</l>
     <l n="128">No ills forgot : each poignant pang we know .</l>
     <l n="129">In proof , attend my friends , this very night ,</l>
     <l n="130">The sad adventures that befell our wight ,</l>
     <l n="131">Who , Castle-William did not reach till late ,</l>
     <l n="132">When they , an hour or more , had shut the gate .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="133">AT length our traveller approached the wall ,</l>
     <l n="134">And , somehow to the foot contrived to crawl ;</l>
     <l n="135">A roofed projection fortune led him near ,</l>
     <l n="136">That joined a house , and ‘ gan his heart to cheer .</l>
     <l n="137">Delighted with the change he now had got ,</l>
     <l n="138">He placed himself upon the sheltered spot ;</l>
     <l n="139">A lucky hit but seldom comes alone ;</l>
     <l n="140">Some straw , by chance , was near the mansion thrown ,</l>
     <l n="141">Which Reynold ‘ neath the jutting penthouse placed</l>
     <l n="142">There , God be praised , cried he , a bed I 've traced .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="143">MEANWHILE , the storm from ev'ry quarter pressed ;</l>
     <l n="144">Our traveller was soon to death distressed ;</l>
     <l n="145">With cold benumbed ; by fell despair o'erspread ;</l>
     <l n="146">He trembled , groaned :— teeth chattered in his head ;</l>
     <l n="147">So loud his plaints , at length they reached the ear</l>
     <l n="148">Of one who dwelled within the mansion near :</l>
     <l n="149">A servant girl ; her mistress brisk and gay :</l>
     <l n="150">A youthful widow , charming as the day ;</l>
     <l n="151">The governor she privately received :</l>
     <l n="152">A noble marquis , who her cares relieved .</l>
     <l n="153">Oft interrupted when he sought the fair ,</l>
     <l n="154">And wished at ease her company to share ;</l>
     <l n="155">Desirous too of passing quite unknown ,</l>
     <l n="156">A private door he presently was shown ,</l>
     <l n="157">That opened to the fields , and gave access :</l>
     <l n="158">Through this he visited with such address ,</l>
     <l n="159">That none within the town his commerce viewed ,</l>
     <l n="160">Nor e'en a servant 's eye his course pursued .</l>
     <l n="161">Surprise I feel , since pleasures of the mind ,</l>
     <l n="162">Apparently were not for lords designed ;</l>
     <l n="163">More pleased they seem when made the talk around</l>
     <l n="164">And soft amours divulged , delights are found .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="165">IT happened that the night our Job arrived ,</l>
     <l n="166">And , stretched on straw , misfortune just survived ,</l>
     <l n="167">The lady thought her fond gallant to see ,</l>
     <l n="168">And ev'ry moment hoped with him to be .</l>
     <l n="169">The supper ready , and the room prepared ,</l>
     <l n="170">Each rarity was served : no trouble spared ;</l>
     <l n="171">Baths , perfumes , wines , most exquisite , in place ,</l>
     <l n="172">And ev'ry thing around displaying grace ,</l>
     <l n="173">With Cupid 's whole artillery in view ,</l>
     <l n="174">Not his , who would with sighs alone pursue ,</l>
     <l n="175">But that kind god who always favour shows ,</l>
     <l n="176">The source of happiness , whence pleasure flows .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="177">MEANWHILE , however , while thus the lady sought .</l>
     <l n="178">By ev'ry charm to please , a note was brought ;</l>
     <l n="179">A page conveyed it , by the marquis sent ,</l>
     <l n="180">To say his coming business would prevent .</l>
     <l n="181">The disappointment doubtless was severe ,</l>
     <l n="182">But consolation certainly was near ;</l>
     <l n="183">It proved to Reynold wonderfully kind ,</l>
     <l n="184">For scarcely had our traveller resigned ,</l>
     <l n="185">And groaned aloud , but , tender as her dame ,</l>
     <l n="186">In haste the confidential servant came ,</l>
     <l n="187">And to the widow said :— I hear below</l>
     <l n="188">Some poor unfortunate o'ercome with woe ;</l>
     <l n="189">‘ Tis piercing cold , and he perhaps will die</l>
     <l n="190">Some place , pray grant , where he to-night may lie .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="191">MOST readily , replied the courteous fair ,</l>
     <l n="192">We never use the garret :— lodge him there ;</l>
     <l n="193">Some straw upon a couch will make a bed ,</l>
     <l n="194">On which the wand'rer may repose his head ;</l>
     <l n="195">Shut well the door , but first provide some meat ,</l>
     <l n="196">And then permit him thither to retreat .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="197">WITHOUT this timely help ‘ twas clear our wight</l>
     <l n="198">Had ne'er survived the horrors of the night ;</l>
     <l n="199">The door was ope 'd , and Reynold blessed the hand</l>
     <l n="200">That gave relief , and stopt life 's ebbing sand .</l>
     <l n="201">His tale he told ; got spirits , strength , and ease ;</l>
     <l n="202">In person tall , well made , and formed to please ,</l>
     <l n="203">He looked not like a novice in amour ,</l>
     <l n="204">Though young , and seeking shelter at a door .</l>
     <l n="205">His want of dress and miserable state</l>
     <l n="206">Raised shame indeed , and showed distress was great .</l>
     <l n="207">Though LOVE be seen in Nature 's pure array ,</l>
     <l n="208">No dirt appears , however you survey .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="209">THIS servant girl now hastened to the fair ,</l>
     <l n="210">And ev'ry circumstance detailed with care .</l>
     <l n="211">See , said the lady , if within the press</l>
     <l n="212">There be not clothes to furnish him a dress ;</l>
     <l n="213">My husband , now no more , must some have left ;</l>
     <l n="214">Yes , said the girl , you 're not of them bereft ,</l>
     <l n="215">I recollect his wardrobe did abound ;</l>
     <l n="216">And presently a handsome suit she found .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="217">MEANWHILE the lady having learned the name</l>
     <l n="218">Of Reynold D'Ast , his quality and fame ,</l>
     <l n="219">( Himself it seems particulars detailed ,</l>
     <l n="220">While all around his suff'rings keen bewailed ,)</l>
     <l n="221">Her orders gave , the bath for her prepared</l>
     <l n="222">Should now receive the man her care had spared .</l>
     <l n="223">Unasked , the stranger this attention got ,</l>
     <l n="224">And well perfumed ere clothes they would allot .</l>
     <l n="225">When dressed , he waited on the widow fair ,</l>
     <l n="226">And paid his compliments with graceful air .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="227">THE supper ( for the marquis first designed )</l>
     <l n="228">At length was served with taste the most refined .</l>
     <l n="229">Our trav'ller glad , an appetite displayed ;</l>
     <l n="230">The lady carefully her guest surveyed ,</l>
     <l n="231">And anxious seemed to gratify his wish ,</l>
     <l n="232">By helping what appeared his favourite dish .</l>
     <l n="233">Already , perhaps , she felt a Cupid 's dart ,</l>
     <l n="234">And in her throbbing bosom knew the smart ;</l>
     <l n="235">Or sympathy , or pity for his woes ,</l>
     <l n="236">Might touch the spring whence softest passion flows .</l>
     <l n="237">On ev'ry side assailed the youthful dame</l>
     <l n="238">Herself surrendered unto Cupid 's flame .</l>
     <l n="239">Should I give way , said she , who 'll tell the tale ?</l>
     <l n="240">No risk is run if secrecy prevail .</l>
     <l n="241">The marquis merits to be played the trick ;</l>
     <l n="242">He no excuse can have , unless he 's sick .</l>
     <l n="243">One sin against another I may weigh ,</l>
     <l n="244">And man for man will equally repay .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="245">SO inexperienced Reynold was not found ,</l>
     <l n="246">But that he saw how things were going round ,</l>
     <l n="247">And , that Saint Julian 's Prayer would yet succeed ,</l>
     <l n="248">To give him all the lodging he might need .</l>

     <l n="249">THE supper o'er , our couple left alone ,</l>
     <l n="250">What fairer field could truly have been shown ?</l>
     <l n="251">The belle now wore a smart becoming dress ,</l>
     <l n="252">Designed , in ev'ry view , to prepossess .</l>
     <l n="253">‘ Twas NEGLIGENCE , so requisite to please</l>
     <l n="254">And fascinate , with airy , careless ease ,</l>
     <l n="255">According to the taste which I pursue ,</l>
     <l n="256">That made her charms so exquisite to view .</l>
     <l n="257">No gaudy tinsel : all was flowing light ;</l>
     <l n="258">Though not superb , yet pleasing to the sight ;</l>
     <l n="259">A neckerchief , where much should be concealed ,</l>
     <l n="260">Was made so narrow ,— beauties half revealed ;</l>
     <l n="261">Beneath is shade — what words can ne'er express ;</l>
     <l n="262">And Reynold saw enough the rest to guess .</l>
     <l n="263">No more I say ; the belle indeed was fair ,</l>
     <l n="264">Possessed of youth and all engaging air ;</l>
     <l n="265">Tall , nicely formed ; each grace , that hearts could win ;</l>
     <l n="266">Not much of fat , nor yet appeared too thin .</l>
     <l n="267">Emotion , at the view , who would not feel ?</l>
     <l n="268">To soft delight what bosom proves of steel ?</l>
     <l n="269">No marble bust , philosopher , nor stone ,</l>
     <l n="270">But similar sensation would have shown .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="271">THE silence first was broken by the dame ;</l>
     <l n="272">Who spoke so freely , Reynold bolder came .</l>
     <l n="273">He knew not well , howe'er , discourse to find ;</l>
     <l n="274">To help him out the widow was inclined ;</l>
     <l n="275">Said she , you much remind me of a friend ,</l>
     <l n="276">Whose ev'ry wish I sought with mine to blend</l>
     <l n="277">My husband ( rest his soul ! ) had just those eyes ,</l>
     <l n="278">That look , air , mouth :— the very height and size :</l>
     <l n="279">You greatly honour me , the spark replied :</l>
     <l n="280">Your charms howe'er might well have been his pride ;</l>
     <l n="281">I ne'er beheld such soft engaging mien :</l>
     <l n="282">On earth , like beauty never yet was seen .</l>
     <l n="283">But , in extremes to be , appears my lot ;</l>
     <l n="284">Just now I felt quite chilled :— at present hot ;</l>
     <l n="285">Pray tell me which is best ? The fair looked down ,</l>
     <l n="286">And humbly seemed to wave the proffered crown ,</l>
     <l n="287">That she might still more flattery receive</l>
     <l n="288">Address not small , if we 'll our eyes believe .</l>
     <l n="289">The swain now praised each charm within his view ,</l>
     <l n="290">And whatsoe'er his wishes could pursue ;</l>
     <l n="291">Where hope was strong , and expectation high ,</l>
     <l n="292">She would not long be cruel and deny .</l>
     <l n="293">To give the praise , your due , the lover cried ,</l>
     <l n="294">And note the beauties that my heart divide ,</l>
     <l n="295">‘ Twould take an age , and I 've a single night ,</l>
     <l n="296">Which surely might be passed with more delight .</l>
     <l n="297">The widow smiled ; enough it seems was said ;</l>
     <l n="298">And Reynold shortened — what to nothing led .</l>
     <l n="299">In war or love , time equally is dear ;</l>
     <l n="300">More happy than our spark none could appear ;</l>
     <l n="301">No point but what he gained ; the smiling dame</l>
     <l n="302">Resistance only showed to raise the flame ;</l>
     <l n="303">Nor more nor less ; each belle like art has got ,</l>
     <l n="304">And practises at will , or maid or not .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="305">BUT truly , it was never my intent</l>
     <l n="306">To count each favour she to Reynold lent ;</l>
     <l n="307">Particulars exact of ev'ry kiss ,</l>
     <l n="308">And all the preludes incident to bliss ;</l>
     <l n="309">Both , doubtless , knew more ways than one to please ;</l>
     <l n="310">And sought , with anxious care , love 's charms to seize .</l>
     <l n="311">On recollection of the wretched state</l>
     <l n="312">In which our traveller had moved of late ,</l>
     <l n="313">Some favour was bestowed :— there , cried the dame ,</l>
     <l n="314">Is something to repay the road you came ;</l>
     <l n="315">This for the cold ; that fear ; there thieves disgraced ;</l>
     <l n="316">So , one by one , the whole was soon effaced .</l>
     <l n="317">In this way to be paid for ills we meet ,</l>
     <l n="318">Who 'd not be satisfied with boons so sweet ?</l>
     <l n="319">And we conclude , that Reynold on the spot ,</l>
     <l n="320">Love 's am'rous recompense of pleasures got .</l>
     <l n="321">Now easy conversation was renewed ;</l>
     <l n="322">Then mutual kisses ; ev'ry sweet pursued .</l>
     <l n="323">‘ Twas time for bed ; howe'er , the widow fair</l>
     <l n="324">Determined that her own the spark should share ;</l>
     <l n="325">‘ Twas prudent , doubtless ; like a lady wise ;</l>
     <l n="326">Gallantly done : one room would well suffice .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="327">WHAT further passed betwixt the pair that night ;</l>
     <l n="328">I cannot say , though we 'll believe ‘ twas right ;</l>
     <l n="329">Between the clothes when laid , and unrestrained ,</l>
     <l n="330">Most clearly , Reynold all his wishes gained .</l>
     <l n="331">There he was recompensed for ev'ry grief ;</l>
     <l n="332">The lady too , received so much relief ,</l>
     <l n="333">That she desired his company again ,</l>
     <l n="334">But still these visits secrets should remain ;</l>
     <l n="335">‘ Twas requisite the governor to see ;</l>
     <l n="336">Howe'er the dame delighted seemed to be ,</l>
     <l n="337">And not content with what she had bestowed ,</l>
     <l n="338">A purse well stored with gold to Reynold showed :</l>
     <l n="339">He took no more , indeed , than what would pay</l>
     <l n="340">The bare expenses on his homeward way ;</l>
     <l n="341">Then sought the street that to the tavern led ,</l>
     <l n="342">Where still his lazy servant was in bed ;</l>
     <l n="343">The fellow mauled ; then changed throughout his dress ;</l>
     <l n="344">Since to the cloak-bag now he had access .</l>
     <l n="345">His fortune to complete , that day they took</l>
     <l n="346">The very wretches that he wished to hook .</l>
     <l n="347">He to the judge repaired with ev'ry haste ;</l>
     <l n="348">In such a case you never time should waste ;</l>
     <l n="349">For , once the things are into court received ,</l>
     <l n="350">‘ Tis like the lion 's den : naught e'er ‘ s retrieved ;</l>
     <l n="351">Their hands are closed , not ‘ gainst what may be brought</l>
     <l n="352">But to secure what from their grasp is sought .</l>
     <l n="353">Who seeks redress by law , facts oft have shown ,</l>
     <l n="354">May bless his stars if he but keep his own .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="355">THE trial o'er , a gallows treble-faced ,</l>
     <l n="356">Was , for their swinging , in the market placed ,</l>
     <l n="357">ONE of the three harangued the mob around ,</l>
     <l n="358">( His speech was for the others also found )</l>
     <l n="359">Then , ‘ bout their necks the halters being tied ,</l>
     <l n="360">Repentant and confessed the culprits died .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="361">WHO , after this , will doubt the pow'r of prayers ?</l>
     <l n="362">These silly knaves had banished all their cares ;</l>
     <l n="363">And when at ease they thought to skip and prance ,</l>
     <l n="364">Were seized and quickly taught another dance .</l>
     <l n="365">On t'other hand , where dire distress prevailed ,</l>
     <l n="366">And death , in various ways , our spark assailed ,</l>
     <l n="367">A beauty suddenly his senses charmed ,</l>
     <l n="368">Who might a prelate 's bosom have alarmed .</l>
     <l n="369">So truly fortunate , indeed , his lot ,</l>
     <l n="370">Again his money , baggage , horse he got ;</l>
     <l n="371">And , thank Saint Julian , howsoever tossed ,</l>
     <l n="372">He passed a , blissful night that nothing cost .</l>
