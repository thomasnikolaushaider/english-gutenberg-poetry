    <docTitle><titlePart>ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG . Between the period of George Herbert , and that of Edward Young , some singular changes had taken place in British poetry as well as in British manners , politics , and religion . There had passed over the land the thunderstorm of the Puritanic Revolt , which had first clouded and then cleared , for a season , the intellectual and moral horizon . The effect of this on poetry was , for such fugitive though felicitous hymns as those of Herbert , to substitute the epic unities and grand choral harmonies of Milton . Then came the Restoration — the Apotheosis of falsehood ; including in that term false principles , false politics , and false taste . Britain became the degraded slave of France , at once in laws and in literature . Dryden , indeed , maintained , in some measure , the character and the taste of his nation , but he stood almost alone . To him succeeded Addison and Pope , both gifted but both timid men , whose genius , great as it was , never , or rarely , ventured on original and daring flights , and who seemed always to be haunted by the fear of French criticism . Pope , especially , lent all his influence to confirm and seal the power of a foreign code of literary laws ; and so general and so deep was the submission , that it is to us one of the strongest proofs of Edward Young 's genius , that he ventured , in that polished but powerless era , to uplift a native voice of song , and not to uplift it in vain ; for , if he did not absolutely make a revolution , or found a school , he yet established himself , and left his poetry as a glorious precedent to all who should afterwards be so hardy as to “ go and do likewise . ” Edward Young was born in June 1681 ( according to some , two years earlier ) , in the village of Upham , Hampshire . His father was rector of the parish , and is represented as a man of great learning and abilities . He was the author of some volumes of sermons , and , on account of their merit , and through the patronage of Lord Bradford , he was appointed chaplain to King William , and Dean of Salisbury . He died in 1705 , in the sixty-third year of his age , and Bishop Burnet , the Sunday after his decease , pronounced a glowing panegyric on his character , in a funeral sermon delivered in the Cathedral .</titlePart></docTitle>

  <body>
   <p>Edward was sent to Winchester School , and thence to Oxford , where he obtained a law fellowship in All-Souls College , and afterwards took successively the degrees of Bachelor and Doctor of Civil Law , besides obtaining a fellowship in 1706 . When the Codrington Library was founded , he was appointed to deliver the Latin oration . It was published , but met with a frigid reception , being full of conceits and puerilities , and the author wisely omitted it from his collected works . Little else is known of his career at College . He is said to have blended fits of study with frequent dissipation . When he relaxed , it was in the company of the infamous Duke of Wharton , who patronised , corrupted , and laughed at him . When he studied , he would shut his windows , create around him an artificial night , and make it more hideous by piling up skulls , cross-bones , and instruments of death in his room . His talent was then as well known as his eccentricity . Tindal the sceptic bore a striking testimony to this when he said , “ The other boys I can always answer , because I always know where they have their arguments , which I have read a hundred times ; but that fellow Young is continually pestering me with something of his own . ”</p>
   <p>He seems to have been nearly thirty ere he began to tune that lyre which was afterwards to thrill with vibrations of song so powerful and melodious . His first choice of a subject was characteristic of the lofty and ambitious tone of his genius : it was , “ The Last Day . ” This poem was written in 1710 , although not given to the world till 1713 . He had previously , in 1712 , published an epistle to Lord Lansdown , which displayed little of his peculiar power , but was at once feeble and pretentious . Young became afterwards heartily ashamed of it . In the same year that “ The Last Day ” appeared , he prefixed to Addison 's “ Cato ” a copy of verses of no great merit . Shortly after , he issued a poem entitled , “ The Force of Religion ; or , Vanquished Love : ” it was founded on the story of Lady Jane Grey and her husband , and was ushered in by a flaming dedication to the Countess of Salisbury . On the death of the Queen , in 1714 , he published a panegyric in verse on her memory , and inscribed it to Addison . In these days flattery to princes and nobles was a commodity almost essential to poetry — a tawdry court dress which every poet was obliged to put on for the nonce ; and not even Dryden has excelled Young in the violent unlikeness and unsparing incense of his adulations . It is satisfactory to remember that , on cool reflection , he cancelled the most of those unworthy effusions ; although he continued to the last very much of a courtier , as the dedications to the “ Night Thoughts ” sufficiently prove . He is supposed about the year 1717 to have visited Ireland in company with Wharton .</p>
   <p>In 1719 his tragedy of “ Busiris ” appeared on the stage , and had considerable success . He sold the copyright afterwards to B. Lintot , for L84 , which , for a first play by an author previously unknown , was thought a large sum . “ Busiris ” is a play of that solemnly pompous and intensely artificial school , the race of which has been long since gathered to its fathers . It is conceived and written in Ercles ’ vein ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>and Nat Lee himself , in his wild ranting plays , has scarcely surpassed the torrents of bombastic nonsense which issue from the lips of Myron . Immediately after “ Busiris ” he published his Paraphrase on part of the Book of Job , a production scarcely worthy either of Young or of the sublime original . The descriptions in that grandest of all poems , which are so rich and massive as to press almost on the sense , are more fairly represented in our common prose translation than in the poetical paraphrase of Young . We are far , however , from being opposed , with some critics , to the principle of paraphrasing Scripture . We admire to enthusiasm many of the Scottish paraphrases , some of Byron 's and Moore 's Hebrew Melodies , and Croly 's Scenes from Scripture ; and should like to see all the poetry of the Bible versified by some competent hand .</p>
   <p>In 1721 appeared “ The Revenge , ” by far the most powerful of his tragedies . Its great fault lies in its likeness to Othello : its great praise is , that , though it imitates and challenges comparison with that Shakspearean masterpiece , it has not been utterly sunk and eclipsed before it . As a play , we think it decidedly second-rate ; the plot is not artistically managed , and the means by which jealousy is excited in the mind of Alonzo , are a very poor and shabby copy of those in Shakspeare . Zanga has been called a “ vulgar caricature of Iago ; ” he is so in part , perhaps , but Young has abated the vulgarity of the imitation by endowing his hero with a wild and native vein of poetry . Iago is a subtler , colder fiend than Zanga , and indulges more in sneers and in smut than in declamation . Zanga 's speeches exhaust the rhetoric of revenge . Iago has nothing but intellect , wit , and malignity . Zanga has an imagination worthy of the hot and lion-peopled land of his birth . Iago , after his detection , sinks into obstinate silence ; he stiffens into the statue of a demon . Zanga dies , using lofty imagery .</p>
   <p>Indeed , “ The Revenge ” owes all its interest to the flames of poetic genius which burst out at every pore of its otherwise coarse and copied structure . It was dedicated to Wharton , with whom Young continued to be intimate ; whom he taught to speak good Latin in the space of six weeks ; and who lent him money to reimburse him for the expenses of an unsuccessful attempt to get into Parliament . This was in 1721 ; the place was Cirencester . The election , however , was contested , and fortunately , perhaps , both for Young and the world , he was unsuccessful . Had he gained the seat , he had very probably ,</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Though born for the universe , narrow 'd his mind ,</l>
     <l n="2">And to party given up what was meant for mankind ; ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">and what comparison between a series of eloquent , forgotten speeches , and</l>
     <l n="4">the starry , ever-burning splendours of the “ Night Thoughts ” ?</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>His disappointment in this attempt , coupled , probably , with remorse for the follies and vices of a misspent youth , seems to have soured Young , and ripened him to the point when satire becomes the unavoidable expression of the irritated yet unsubdued spirit . In 1725 appeared the first part of his “ Universal Passion ; ” the rest came out in successive satires between that and 1728 , when they were collected and published , along with a somewhat querulous preface , in which he hints that he had not found poetry very favourable to preferment . He gained , however , L3000 by these poems , of which , according to Spence , L2000 was contributed by the Duke of Grafton , who did not , however , regret the price . His inscriptions of the several satires were , as usual at the time , stuffed with fulsome praise of such men as Dorset , Dodington , Campton , and Sir Robert Walpole , all of whom appreciated and rewarded the compliments . We reserve our criticism on these remarkable productions till afterwards , noticing only at present , that they were published before the satires of Pope , and that they became instantly popular .</p>
   <p>As if to propitiate the Nemesis , who always stands behind the chariot of the popular writer , Young next issued two of the poorest of all his unequal productions . The first of these , entitled “ The Instalment , ” was addressed to Sir Robert Walpole , and is , perhaps , although the word be a wide one , the most nonsensical and trashy lie in verse ever addressed to a prime minister . The second is an “ Ode to Ocean , ” a compound of doggrel and stilted dulness — which , indeed , any sailor of education might have composed , if “ half-seas-over . ”</p>
   <p>At length , sick of dissipation , of the stage , of bad odes , and good satires , Young determined to become wise , and enter into orders . An irresistible current had long been carrying him on , with many a convulsive recalcitration on his part , to this determination . That great intellect and heart , over which , already , the shadow of the “ Night Thoughts ” was beginning to gather , could not be satisfied with the society of “ peers , poets , ” and demireps ; with the applause of sweltering crowds collected in theatres ; or with the ebullitions of its own giant spleen , in the shape of epigrammatic satires . The world , which once seemed to his eye so fresh and fair , had withered gradually to a skeleton , with sockets for eyes , with eternal baldness for hair , with a “ stench instead of a sweet savour , and burning instead of beauty . ” He resolved to proclaim the particulars of this painful yet blessed disenchantment to the ends of the earth , and to all classes of mankind . And for this purpose , he first of all mounted the pulpit , and then began to wield what was even then the mightier engine of the press . He was no novice when he entered the ministry . Would that we had more who , like Young , do not go up by a mechanical ladder , and the mere force of custom , to the pulpit , but who come down upon it from long and vain wanderings elsewhere , and with a conviction , as the result of mature experience , that God there still desires to dwell , and that it constitutes even yet a pinnacle of prospect , and power , and promise ! Thus came Herbert , and Chalmers , and Foster , to their real work as ministers of the gospel . It is not a boy , but a Boanerges-ministry that introduces the Word with most effect to a gainsaying world . Young was full forty-seven — mature in years , in acquirements , in experience , and in reputation — when he began to publish the “ News that it is well . ” Like the eminent men we have just mentioned , and like others whom we might mention , his motives in entering the Church have been calumniated . He has been compared to a lady disappointed in love , taking the veil ; and , rather inconsistently with this figure , to a sated sensualist becoming an anchorite . How can both be true ? If Young was disappointed , how could he be sated ? and if sated , how could he be chagrined by the want of satisfaction ? The fact is , that such men as Young , Chalmers , Herbert , and Foster , are altogether superior to common standards of judgment , and must be tried by their peers . All had their own share of the disgusts and dissatisfactions connected with life , and all felt them keenly . But all had a deeper reason still — a reason , we grant , probably stirred by circumstances into action , for renouncing the empty arena of this world 's honours and wealth , and devoting themselves to a higher and nobler purpose . They all saw into the hollowness of society , into the misery of the human heart ; and felt that the gospel alone could fill that aching void , and satisfy those dreary cravings . Hence , Herbert quitted the pleasures of a court ; Chalmers dropped his air-pump and his telescope ; Foster resigned his philosophic speculations ; and Young shook off the blandishments of peers , and forgot the claps of multitudes , to proclaim the glad tidings to perishing sinners ; and verily all , in different measures , had their reward .</p>
   <p>In April 1728 he was appointed chaplain to George II . His tragedy , “ The Brothers , ” which had been in rehearsal , was prudently withdrawn . It is a play superior to “ Busiris , ” but very much inferior to “ The Revenge . ” Full of passion and poetry , of startling scenes , and vivid images , its subject is unpleasing , and the various perplexities of the plot are not skilfully disentangled .</p>
   <p>In the same year he published “ A True Estimate of Human Life , ” written with force and ingenuity ; and a long and very loyal sermon , preached before the House of Commons , on the Martyrdom of Charles I . It was entitled , “ An Apology for Princes ; or , the Reverence due to Governments . ”</p>
   <p>Hitherto Young had lived on the proceeds of his fellowship , and on presents from Wharton , who , at his death , too , left him a pension . He became now , however , very naturally anxious for promotion in that new sphere on which he had entered , and was compelled , proh pudor ! to lay his case before Mrs Howard , the favourite mistress of George II .— that identical “ good Howard , ” who figures so curiously in the famous scene between Jeanie Deans and Queen Caroline . The fact of the application , as well as the terms of the letter he wrote her , renders this the most humiliating incident in all Young 's history . In 1730 , he published “ Imperium Pelagi , ” another naval lyric , as bad and much longer than his “ Ode to Ocean . ” In the same year he wrote an epistle to Pope , which resembles a coarser and more careless production of the little man of Twickenham .</p>
   <p>In July 1730 , Young was presented by his college to the rectory of Welwyn in Hertfordshire . We refer our readers , for various delightful speculations and anecdotes about his residence and labours there , to Bulwer 's Student . He was a powerful preacher . His sermons seem to have been striking in thought , rich in image , intensely practical in tendency , and were delivered with great animation and effect . It is told , that on one occasion , while preaching at St James 's before the Court and His Majesty , on some subject of transcendent importance , and not being able to command the attention or awaken the feelings of his audience , he at length threw himself back into the pulpit , and burst into tears . That was itself a sermon ! The figure of this weeping Titan , who could have rent rocks and severed mountains , but who had failed in breaking the hearts of any of his courtly hearers , is one of the most affecting in the annals of pulpit oratory . Alas ! what preacher who has ever aimed at Young 's object , has not been at times tempted to assume Young 's attitude , and to shed Young 's bitter and burning tears ? “ Who hath believed our report , and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed ? ”</p>
   <p>In 1731 , Young , at the mature age of fifty , married the Lady Elizabeth Lee , daughter of the Earl of Lichfield , and widow of Colonel Lee . This marriage sprung out of his father 's acquaintance with Lady Ann Wharton , who was co-heiress of Sir Henry Lee of Ditchley in Oxfordshire , and seems to have been very happy . He next published another of those stupid odes by which he seemed predestined to disgrace his genius , entitled “ A Sea Piece . ” It was as though Milton had tried to write Anacreontics . A few years afterwards appeared “ The Foreign Address , or the Best Argument for Peace , ” occasioned by the posture of affairs in which the British fleet was then placed , and written in the character of a sailor . It is a mere tissue of sounding verbiage — or , as Hamlet hath it , “ Words , words , words . ” About this time Young met with Voltaire , who , according to the story , was ridiculing Milton 's allegory of “ Death and Sin , ” when our hero struck in with the extempore epigram :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Thou art so witty , profligate , and thin ,</l>
     <l n="2">That thou thyself art Milton , Death , and Sin . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>We cannot see very much wit in this epigram , even in that best shape which we have now given it ; but it was not inappropriate to the lean denier , who sought to empty everything of the important element — its God ; to leave the universe , like himself , a grinning skeleton , and to smile in ghastly sympathy over the completed ruin . We fancy we see the two gifted men , the one the representative of the scepticism of France , the other , of the belief of England , meeting and conversing together . Voltaire is not much in advance of thirty ; Young is fifty , and more . Voltaire 's face is worn with premature thought and inordinate laughter ; Young 's , though older , bears a warmer and more sanguine flush . Voltaire has the insincerest of smiles playing constantly over his face like the light of an aurora borealis ; Young 's countenance is grave , settled , open , and serene , as the radiance of an autumn sunset . In Voltaire 's eye you see the future “ Candide ” laughing down in its depths , while on Young 's brow lies the dim and magnificent promise of the “ Night Thoughts . ” After meeting , talking , bowing , wondering , and recoiling , they part for ever ; Voltaire sighing through smiles as he thinks of the “ misled giant of Religion ; ” and Young smiling through sighs as he thinks of the “ wondrous and well-nigh human ape of Infidelity . ”</p>
   <p>By his wife Young had one son , Frederick . He does not seem to have been a particularly well-behaved youth ; indeed , his father for some time before his death refused to see him , although he ultimately sent him his forgiveness , and made him his heir . But no son of illustrious father has ever had harder measure dealt him . It has been generally supposed that he was the Lorenzo of the “ Night Thoughts , ” a poem published when Frederick was only eight years of age , and when he could scarcely have even thought of committing those crimes of scepticism and reckless self-gratification with which Young charges his imaginary or half-real hero .</p>
   <p>The Poet 's life , during the first ten years of his rectorship at Welwyn , flowed on in an even tenor . He was regular in his conduct , happy in his family , diligent in his pastoral duties , and easy in his fortune . His preaching was popular and useful . His studies were principally connected with his own profession , and yielded him a growing satisfaction . An anonymous writer in the Gentleman 's Magazine for 1782 , who seems to have been intimate with him , thus describes him :— “ The dignity of a great and good mind appeared in all his actions , and in all his words . He conversed on religious subjects with the cheerfulness of virtue ; his piety was undebased by gloom or enthusiasm ; he was regular in the performance of all its duties , both in public and in private . In his domestic character he was amiable as he was venerable in the Christian . His politeness was such as I never saw equalled : it was invariable to his superiors in rank ; to his equals and to his inferiors it differed only in degrees of elegance . I never heard him speak with roughness to the meanest servant . In conversation upon lively subjects he had a brilliancy of wit which was peculiar to himself ; I know not how to describe it but by saying that it was both heightened and softened by the amiable qualities of his soul . I have seen him ill and in pain , yet the serenity of his mind remained unruffled . I never heard a peevish expression fall from his lips . ” Few of his brilliancies are preserved , since , unfortunately , he had no Boswell attached to his heels . But one or two of the sayings that have floated down to us are singularly characteristic . On one very stormy night Young went out to his garden , and remained some time . When he returned , one expressed wonder why he had stayed so long in such an evening . “ Oh , ” he replied , “ it is a very fine night ; the Lord is abroad . ” He was very fond of a garden , and inscribed on the wall of his summer-house the words , Ambulantes in horto audiebant vocem Dei ( Walking in the garden , they heard the voice of God ) . He had also erected a dial with the inscription , Eheu fugaces ! which , he said with a smile to Mr Langton , “ was sadly verified , for by the next morning my dial had been carried off . ” Though sometimes melancholy , he was disposed to encourage mirth in others , and established an assembly and bowling-green in his parish .</p>
   <p>And had this been all — had Young continued to pursue such an even , equable course — he had been by this time well-nigh forgotten ; for we do not think that either his satires or plays would of themselves have preserved his name . But it was decreed that grief should co-operate with disappointment in unfolding the full riches of his mind . Antaeus was strongest when he touched the ground . Job was never so eloquent till he was prostrated on his dunghill . And , in order to be able to write the “ Night Thoughts , ” Young must be plunged in the deepest gloom of affliction — “ Thrice flew the shaft , and thrice his peace was slain . ” In 1736 , a daughter of his wife , by a former husband , died . This was Mrs Temple — the Narcissa of his great poem . Her disease was a lingering one . Young accompanied her to Lyons , where she died , and where her remains were brutally denied sepulture , as the dust of a Protestant . Her husband , Mr Temple , or Philander , died four years later ; and in 1741 , Young 's wife , or Lucia , also expired . He now felt himself alone , and blasted in his solitude . But his grief did not sink into sullen inactivity . He made it oracular , and distilled his tears into song . The “ Night Thoughts ” were immediately commenced , and published between 1742 and 1744 . This marvellous poem was all composed either at night , or when riding on horseback — an exercise , by the way , which gives a sense of mastery and confidence , stirs the blood , elevates the animal spirits , and has been felt by many to be eminently favourable to thought and mental composition . It inspired , we know , such men as Burns , Byron , Shelley , and Delta . We love to think of Young riding through the green lanes of his parish , and cooing out to himself his plaintive minstrelsies . We love better still to watch his lonely lamp shining at midnight , like a star , through the darkness , and seeming to answer the far signal of those mightier luminaries which are burning above in the Great Bear and Orion — the poet the while now dipping his pen to indite his ardent immortalities — now leaning his head on his widowed arm , and surrendering himself to paroxysms of uncontrollable anguish — and now looking out upon the Night as the “ Lord is abroad ” on the wings of the tempest , or as He is silently shining out his name in suns and galaxies — those unwearied “ Watchers ” and unbaptized “ Holy Ones . ”</p>
   <p>In 1745 , Young wrote “ Reflections on the Public Situation of the Kingdom ” — a production which made no impression at the time , and is now entirely forgotten . He did not include it in the collection of his works . In 1753 , the tragedy of “ The Brothers , ” which had lain past for thirty years , was produced on the stage . Young gave the profits of the play , and several hundreds from his own pocket , amounting to a thousand pounds in all , to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel — an act which surely balances the stories usually told of his love of money and thirst for preferment .</p>
   <p>His next work was , “ The Centaur not Fabulous , in Six Letters to a Friend . ” Its subjects were , the infidelity and licentiousness of that age . It is a pity that this book has fallen into oblivion , as it is a very rich and powerful piece of writing . It is full of clear , sharp , sententious truth . Its style palpitates with energy , and glitters with poetic image . We wish we saw it reprinted in a cheap form ; for , although infidelity and pleasure have both materially changed their phases , there is much in Young 's little work that has an imperishable application , and that would be even yet eminently useful . The character of Altamont is supposed to represent Lord Euston — a nobleman notorious for his vices . The age in which Young 's lot was cast was characterised by a low , sneering scepticism , and his earnest and awful letters were treated with ridicule . Many pronounced him mad , others whispered about dotage . Now , the book seems replete with wisdom , and burning almost with prophetic fire .</p>
   <p>Young , in fact , was not generally appreciated during his lifetime . Tried by the Boileau and Pope standard , his writings were pronounced turgid , strained , and extravagant . Even Warburton , who should have known better , passed a severe judgment on the “ Night Thoughts . ” He had , however , his warm admirers , prominent among whom was the amiable and learned Joseph Warton . He dedicated to Young his “ Essay on Pope ” — an essay containing the first sober and discriminating estimate of that most artificial of true poets , and with the opinions expressed in which Young is supposed to have coincided ; for , although he admired , and too often imitated , Pope 's brilliant point and antithesis , he was aware of far higher models , and found Homer , Milton , and Job far more congenial companions in his studious midnights . In 1758 , he published a short and in nowise remarkable sermon , preached before the King at Kensington .</p>
   <p>Richardson , the novelist , was one of Young 's greatest friends . Their views on moral and religious subjects were identical ; and in gravity of tone , and severity of genius , they resembled each other — Richardson being a duller Young , and Young a more elastic and brilliant Richardson . Although both lived in a most depraved age , neither catered to its tastes . To Richardson , Young addressed , in 1759 , a letter on Original Composition , which betrays no symptoms of senility , but is full of vigorous and striking remark . In 1762 , when upwards of eighty , he wrote his last and worst poem . It is entitled “ Resignation , ” and requires , on the part of the reader , considerable exercise of that grace . It has very little of Young 's peculiar power , and is chiefly filled with weak and toothless abuse of his old acquaintance Voltaire . It was written , it appears , at the instance of Mrs Boscawen — the widow of the Admiral — who , having found consolation from the “ Night Thoughts , ” visited Young , and was still more captivated by his conversation .</p>
   <p>During the latter years of his life , he is said to have fallen too much under the dominion of his housekeeper , Mrs Hallowes , the widow of a clergyman , who is reported to have ruled him with a rod of iron . Ere his death he revised his printed works , and gave charges in his will that all his MSS . should be burned . He applied , when past eighty , to Archbishop Secker for promotion , and was appointed Clerk of the Closet to the Princess-Dowager of Wales . In April 1765 , at the age of eighty-four , he breathed his last . He had been previously unable to perform duty for three or four years , but retained his faculties to the last . He left his property principally to his son , who was found by Johnson and Boswell , in 1781 , residing at Welwyn , and cherishing the memory of his father .</p>
   <p>Young was unquestionably a neglected man . Out of all sight the greatest genius then connected with the ministry of the Church of England , he never mounted one step higher than the rectorship his own college had conferred on him . Many reasons have been assigned for this . Some say that it was because he had attached himself to the side of Frederick , Prince of Wales , and had preached an obnoxious sermon at St James 's ; others , that it was because he had received a pension through Sir Robert Walpole . We think that the real cause lay in the vulgar and senseless prejudice which prevailed then , and in some measure prevails still , against a literary divine , as if he were a hybrid , or “ centaur , not fabulous . ” Let us not blame that age so long as we remember the burning shame reflected on ours by the fact that the gifted and high-charactered author of Salathiel , and Paris in 1815 , is still only the rector of St Stephen 's , Walbrook , while many younger men , who in comparison with him are of little mark , have reached the episcopal bench . Probably Young felt himself consoled for his bad success , by the knowledge that his name and great poem had travelled to foreign lands , and that Madame Klopstock was wondering — good , simple soul !— that her husband 's idol and her own , had not been made Archbishop of Canterbury .</p>
   <p>Very little beyond what we have mentioned has been left on record about his private habits and manners . It was his custom , when well pleased with a passage in the course of his reading , to double down the leaf — when particularly gratified , to mark it by two folds ; and some favourite works , such as The Rambler , had so many of these marks of approbation that they would not shut . On one occasion , in replying to Tonson and Lintot , who were both candidates for printing one of his works , he misdirected the letters ; and when Lintot opened his , he found it begun — “ Bernard Lintot is so great a scoundrel , ” &amp; c. Young was proverbial for absence of mind , and sometimes forgot whether he had dined or not . Yet in Welwyn his mode of life was rather systematic . He rose early , made his domestics join him in morning prayer , read little , ate and drank moderately , walked much in his churchyard , and , in general , retired to rest punctually at eight evening . His son told Dr Johnson that he was cheerful in company , but gloomy when alone , and that he never fully recovered his spirits after his wife 's death . Mr Jones , his curate , has confirmed this statement , although the gossipping and heartless tone of his letters about such a man cannot be too strongly condemned . Young was subject to fits of inspiration , which stupid people confounded with madness . At times his poetry rushed upon him like a whirlwind , and caught him up</p>
   <p>“ Like swift Ezekiel , by his lock of hair ” —</p>
   <p>and when he came down he seemed weak , panting , and powerless . Mrs Boscawen and others describe his conversation as still more remarkable than his writings , although occasionally disfigured by conceits and bad puns .</p>
   <p>We come now to speak of his genius , especially as manifested in the “ Night Thoughts . ” The subject of this wonderful strain was one which , in its novelty , dignity , and depth , challenged the very highest exercise of the very highest faculties ; and had Young risen to the full height of his great argument , he had become the greatest of all poets . This we by no means affirm he did ; but we do assert , that many of the aspects of his magnificent theme have been fully and eloquently expressed by him , and that some of his passages are unsurpassed in the language of men .</p>
   <p>The poem demands a brief critical consideration as to its season , its argument , its imagery , its style , its versification , its comparative place and merit , and , lastly , the genius of its author . First , of its season — the Night — and the use to which he turns it . Night had never before found a worthy laureate . Its profound silence , as if it were listening to catch the accents of some supernal voice — the shadowy grandeur and mysterious newness it gives to objects on the earth — the divine hues into which its moon discolours all things — the deep sleep which then falleth upon men , and changes the world into one hushed grave — the supernatural shapes and mystic sounds which have been supposed to walk in its darkness , or to echo through its depths — the voices scarce less solemn , which often break its silence , of howling winds , and wailing rivers , and shrieking tempests , and groaning thunders , and the wild cries of human misery and despair — and last and highest , its withdrawal of the bright mist and mantle of day from the starry universe , and the pomp with which it unrols and exhibits its “ great map ” of suns and systems — its silvery satellites — its meek planets , each shining in its own degree of reflected splendour — its oceans of original and ever-burning fire called suns — its comets , those serpents of the sky , trailing their vast volumes of deadly glory through the shuddering system — its fantastic and magnificent shapes and collocations of stars , the constellations — its firmaments rising above firmaments , like rounds in a ladder , at the top of which is the throne of God — and those two awful arms into which its Milky Way diverges , and which seem uplifted to heaven in silent prayer , or in some deep and dread protest ,— all these elements of interest and grandeur had existed from the beginning of the world in Night , and yet had never , till Young arose , awakened any consecutive and lofty strain of poetic adoration . Many beautiful and many sublime sentiments had been uttered by poets about particular features of Night , but there had been no attempt to represent it as a whole . There were many single thoughts , but no large and sounding Hymn . The views of the Pagan poets about astronomy were , of course , warped by the absurd systems of their day ; and this served to damp their fire , and to render their poetic tributes rather fantastic than truly powerful . Even Dante and Milton are somewhat embarrassed by the Ptolemaic system , although it proves the strength of their genius that they have extracted so much poetry from it . But before Young arose ,</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Nature and nature 's laws lay hid in night ;</l>
     <l n="2">God said , Let Newton be , and all was light ; ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">and he has set the Newtonian system to his own martial music .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>We are far from contending that Young has exhausted the poetry of the theme . Since his time the telescopes of Herschell and Lord Rosse have been turned to the skies , and have greatly extended the size and splendour of that vast midnight Apparition — the starry scheme . Our recent poets have availed themselves of these discoveries , as witness the eloquent rhapsodies about the stars by Bailey , A. Smith , and Bigg . And there is even yet room for another great poem on the subject , entitled “ Night , ” were the author come . But Young deserves praise for the following things :—</p>
   <p>1st , He has nobly sung the magnitude and unutterable glory of the starry hosts . His soul kindles , triumphs , exults under the midnight canopy . As the Tartar horse when led forth from his stable to the free steppes and free firmament of the desert , bounds , prances , and caracoles for joy , so does Young , in the last part of his poem . Escaped from dark and mournful contemplations on Man , Death , Infidelity , and Earth 's “ melancholy map , ” he sees the stars like bright milestones on the way to heaven , and his spirit is glad within him , and tumultuous is the grandeur , and fierce and rapid the torrent , of his song .</p>
   <p>2dly , He has brought out , better than any other poet , the religion of the stars . “ Night , ” says Isaac Taylor , “ has three daughters , Atheism , Superstition , and Religion . ” Following out this fine thought , we see Atheism looking up with impudent eye , brazen brow , and naked figure , to the midnight sky , as if it were only a huge toy-shop of glittering gew-gaws ; Superstition shrouding herself in a black mantle , and falling down prostrate and trembling before these innumerable fires , as if they were the eyes of an infinite enemy ; while Religion turns aloft her humble , yet fearless form , her tear-trembling yet radiant visage , and murmurs , “ My Father made them all . ” Young , we need scarcely say , finds in the nocturnal heavens lessons neither of Atheism nor of Superstition , but of Religion , and reads in the face of Old Night her divine origin , the witness she bears to the existence of God , her dependence upon her Author , and her subordination to His purposes . He had magnified , as Newton himself could not so eloquently have done , the extent of the universe ; and yet his loyalty to Scripture compels him to intimate that this system , so far from being God , or infinite , or , strictly speaking , Divine , is to perish and pass away . One look from the angry Judge , one uplifting of His rod , and its voluminous waves of glory , like another Red Sea , are to be dried up , that the people of God may pass through and enter on the land of the real Immortality , the “ inheritance incorruptible , undefiled , and that shall never fade away . ” We refer our readers to that most eloquent picture , near the beginning of the Ninth Night , of the Last Day . We once heard a lecturer on chemistry close a superb description of the material universe , with the words , “ And it is to shine on for ever . ” We thought of the words of Peter , “ All these things shall be dissolved . ” And then we fancied an invisible animalcule inhabiting one of the mountain peaks of a furnace , looking abroad from one of its surging spires , and saying , “ This wondrous blaze is to burn for ever , ” and yet , ere a few hours have passed , the flame is sunk in ashes , and the animalcule is gone . So the Heavens shall pass away with a great noise . They shall perish , but Thou God remainest ; nay , thou Man , too , art destined to survive this splendid nursery , and to enter on new Heavens and a new Earth !</p>
   <p>The argument of the “ Night Thoughts ” may be stated in general to be as follows :— It is to shew the vanity of man as mortal ; to inculcate the lowness , misery , and madness of the sensual life ; to prove the superiority of the Christian to the man of the world , both in life and in death , and the worthlessness of merely human friendship ; to argue , from nature and reason , the truth of man 's immortality ; to shew the reasonableness of religion , and to inculcate the necessity of a divine revelation , and of a propitiatory sacrifice . That this argument is always steadily pursued , or logically pled , we do not pretend . It has its flaws ;— we particularly demur to many of its proofs of the immortality of the soul , which seem to us very feeble and unsatisfactory ; but , taking it as a whole , it is unanswerable and overwhelming . Its links are of red-hot iron ; its appeals to the conscience are irresistible ; and he who can read it with indifference , or rise from it unimpressed and unawed , must be either something worse or something less than man . It needs not to be surrounded by panegyrics . Convinced , purified , elevated , saved Souls , are the gems in its crown . We are inclined to believe that , in this aspect , the “ Night Thoughts ” has effected more practical good than the “ Paradise Lost . ” The latter is a splendid picture ; the former a searching , powerful sermon . Now , although pictures with a strong moral contained in them have often done much good , they want the point , emphasis , and effect of great sermons . You may gaze long enough at Milton with no feeling besides admiration of his genius ; but in every page Young is grappling with your conscience , and saying , “ Do n't look at me , but look to yourself . ” Foster , one of the greatest of our practical reasoners on religion , has been much indebted to Young , whom he resembled also in the sombre grandeur of his genius .</p>
   <p>Young 's imagery is distinguished by its richness , originality , and exceeding boldness . It was verily a new thing in that timid and conventional age . Like the imagery of all highest poets , it is selected alike from low and from lofty objects , from the gay and the gloomy , from stars and dunghills . His mind moves along through the poem like a great wheel , now descending and now ascending , easy to criticise , but impossible to resist . You may question the taste of many of his figures , such as that of the Sun —</p>
   <p>“ Rude drunkard , rising rosy from the main ; ”</p>
   <p>or when he speaks of God as the “ Great Philanthropist ; ” or calls the moon “ the Portland of the skies ; ” but you always feel yourself in contact with a new , native , overflowing mind — with a mind which has read nature through man , and man through nature . There is to Young 's genius nothing common or unclean in the material universe . All points up to God , and looks round significantly to man . His imagination has no limits , and , when he is thoroughly roused , like the war-horse of Job , the “ glory of his nostrils is terrible ; ” it is the fury of power , the revel of conscious wealth , the “ prancing of a mighty one ; ” not the dance of mere fancy , but the earnestness and energy of one treading a winepress alone . In proof of this , we appeal to his splendid passages on the miserable state of Man , on Dreams , on Procrastination , to one half of his defence of Immortality , and to the whole of his descant on the Stars . This every one feels is power — barbarous power , if you will — savage , mismanaged power , if you please to call it so ; but power that moves , agitates , overwhelms , hurries you away like an infant on the stream of a cataract .</p>
   <p>His diction is , on the whole , a worthy medium to his thought . It has been somewhat spoiled by intimacy with Pope 's writings , and is often vitiated with antithesis , an excess in which was the mode of the day . Now and then , too , he is coarse and violent , to vulgarity , in his expressions . But whenever he forgets Pope , and remembers Milton — or , still more , when he becomes swallowed up in the magnitude of his theme — his language is easy , powerful , and magnificent . It never , as Mitford asserts , is unsupported by a “ corresponding grandeur of thought . ” There is more thought in Young 's poem — more sharp , clear , original reflection — more of that matter which leaves stings behind it — more moral sublimity — than in any poem which has appeared since in Britain . Mitford says , that “ every image is amplified to the utmost . ” Some images unquestionably are ; but amplification is not a prevailing vice of Young 's style — it is , indeed , inconsistent with that pointed intensity which is his general manner ; and how comes it , if he be a diffuse and wordy writer , that his pages literally sparkle with maxims , and that , next perhaps to Shakspeare , no poet has been so often quoted ? What the same writer means by Young “ fatiguing the reader 's mind , ” we can understand ; since it is fatiguing to look long at the sun , or to follow the grand parabola of the eagle 's flight ; but how he should “ dissatisfy ” the mind of any intelligent and candid reader , is to us extraordinary . It is not true that the work has “ a uniformity of subject . ” Its tone is rather uniform , but its subjects are as varied as they are important . They are — Man — the World — Ambition — Pleasure — Infidelity — Immortality — Death — Judgment — Heaven — Hell — the Stars — Eternity . Mr Mitford compares Young to Seneca ; as if a cold collector of stiff maxims , and a poet whose wisdom was set in enthusiasm as in a ring of fire , were proper subjects of comparison . And it is strange how he should introduce the name of Cicero , as if he were not that very master of amplification , and of over-copiousness of expression , which Mitford imagines Young to be ! “ No selection — no discreet and graceful reservation — no experienced taste ! ” — in other words , he was not Pope or Campbell , but Edward Young — not a middle-sized , neat , and well-dressed citizen , but a hirsute giant — not an elegant parterre , but an American forest , bowing only to the old Tempests , and offering up a holocaust of native wealth and glory , not to Man , but to God .</p>
   <p>His versification is a more vulnerable point . We grant at once that it is , as a whole , rugged and imperfect , and that , while his single lines are often exceedingly melodious , he rarely reaches , any more than Pope or Johnson , those long and linked swells of sound —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Floating , mingling , interweaving ,</l>
     <l n="2">Rising , sinking , and receiving</l>
     <l n="3">Each from each , while each is giving</l>
     <l n="4">On to each , and each relieving</l>
     <l n="5">Each , the pails of gold , the living</l>
     <l n="6">Current through the air is heaving ” —</l>
   </lg>
   <p>which Goethe has so beautifully , although unintentionally , described in these words , applied by him to the elements of Nature ; and which he and Milton , and Spenser , and Coleridge , and Shelley , have so admirably exemplified in their verse . Young 's style is too broken and sententious to permit the miracles of melody which are found in some of our poets . Yet he has a few passages which approach even to this high standard . Take the following :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Look nature through , ‘ tis revolution all ;</l>
     <l n="2">All change , no death . Day follows night , and night</l>
     <l n="3">The dying day ; stars rise and set and rise ;</l>
     <l n="4">Earth takes th ’ example . See the summer gay ,</l>
     <l n="5">With her green chaplet , and ambrosial flowers ,</l>
     <l n="6">Droops into pallid autumn ; winter gray ,</l>
     <l n="7">Horrid with frost , and turbulent with storm ,</l>
     <l n="8">Blows autumn , and his golden fruits away ;</l>
     <l n="9">Then melts into the spring . Soft spring , with breath</l>
     <l n="10">Favonian , from warm chambers of the south ,</l>
     <l n="11">Recalls the first . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="12">Or take the well-known burst which closes the First Night :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">“ The sprightly lark 's shrill matin wakes the morn ;</l>
     <l n="14">Grief 's sharpest thorn hard pressing on my breast ,</l>
     <l n="15">I strive , with wakeful melody , to cheer</l>
     <l n="16">The sullen gloom , sweet Philomel ! like thee ,</l>
     <l n="17">And call the stars to listen : every star</l>
     <l n="18">Is deaf to mine , enamour 'd of thy lay .</l>
     <l n="19">Yet be not vain ; there are , who thine excel ,</l>
     <l n="20">And charm through distant ages : wrapt in shade ,</l>
     <l n="21">Prisoner of darkness ! to the silent hours</l>
     <l n="22">How often I repeat their rage divine ,</l>
     <l n="23">To lull my griefs , and steal my heart from woe !</l>
     <l n="24">I roll their raptures , but not catch their fire ,</l>
     <l n="25">Dark , though not blind , like thee , Maeonides !</l>
     <l n="26">Or his , who made Maeonides our own .</l>
     <l n="27">Man , too , he sung ; immortal man I sing ;</l>
     <l n="28">Oft bursts my song beyond the bounds of life ;</l>
     <l n="29">What , now , but immortality , can please ?</l>
     <l n="30">O had he press 'd his theme , pursued the track</l>
     <l n="31">Which opens out of darkness into day !</l>
     <l n="32">O had he , mounted on his wing of fire ,</l>
     <l n="33">Soar 'd where I sink , and sung immortal man !</l>
     <l n="34">How had it bless 'd mankind , and rescued me ! ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The reader will notice how , in this noble passage , the individual sentences and points are all subordinated to the main purpose of the poet , and being subjected to the general stress of the strain , do not detract from , but add to , its musical unity .</p>
   <p>The comparative place of the poem , and the genius of the writer , are two subjects which are closely connected , and indeed slide into each other . The “ Night Thoughts ” must not be named , in interest , finish , sustained sublimity , and artistic completeness , with the “ Iliad , ” the “ Divina Commedia , ” or the “ Paradise Lost . ” It ranks , however , at the top of such a high class of poems as Cowper 's Poems , Thomson 's “ Seasons , ” Byron 's Poems , Blair 's “ Grave , ” Pollock 's “ Course of Time , ” and a few others not very often criticised now-a-days . Young , however , seems to us to have been capable of even higher things than he has effected in his works . He was one of those prolific , fiery , inexhaustible souls , who never seem nearing a limit , or dreaming of a shallow in their genius ; who , often stumbling over precipices or precipitated into pools , rise stronger , and rush on faster , from their misadventures ; who , sometimes stopping too long to moralise on fungi and ant-hillocks , are all the better breathed to career through endless forests , and to take Alps and Andes at a flying leap ; and who are</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Ne'er so sure our pleasure to create ,</l>
     <l n="2">As when they tread the brink of all we hate . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>His taste was not equal certainly to his other faculties , and he was guilty of occasional extravagances , and stumbled not unfrequently over the brink of the bathos ; but his genius possessed the following qualities :— It was original . He had read much , but he copies little , and never slavishly . His mind looks at everything — at skulls and stars — through a medium of its own . It was subtle as well as native and strong , and in its movements it is broadly based on a vigorous intellect . It was progressive and prophetic in its spirit , and many of our recent speculations or semi-speculations on the relations of man and nature , are to be found in Young — ay , in the mere spray his mind threw off on its way to an ulterior result . Think of this , for instance , and then remember a similar expression in Carlyle :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Man 's grief is but his grandeur in disguise ;</l>
     <l n="2">And discontent is immortality . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Finally , his genius , with all its compass and daring , was reverent and religious . He gloried in the universe ; he swam , as it were , and circled like a strong swimmer , in that starry sea ; but he bent before the Cross , and , instead of looking up , looked down , and cried out , “ God be merciful to me a sinner . ”</p>
   <p>We commend his masterpiece to readers , partly , indeed , for its power ,— a power that has hitherto rather been felt than acknowledged , rather admired in silence than analysed ; but principally because , like “ The Temple ” of Herbert , it is holy ground . The author , amid his elaborate ingenuities , and wilful though minor perversities , never ceases to love and to honour truth ; in pursuit of renown , he is never afraid to glory in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ ; and if his flights of fancy be at times too wild , and if his thoughts be often set to the tune of the tempest , it is a tempest on whose wings , to use his own simple but immortal words , “ The Lord is abroad . ”</p>
   <p>THE COMPLAINT : OR , NIGHT THOUGHTS .</p>
   <p>PREFACE .</p>
   <p>As the occasion of this Poem was real , not fictitious ; so the method pursued in it was rather imposed by what spontaneously arose in the Author 's mind on that occasion , than meditated or designed . Which will appear very probable from the nature of it . For it differs from the common mode of poetry , which is , from long narrations to draw short morals . Here , on the contrary , the narrative is short , and the morality arising from it makes the bulk of the Poem . The reason of it is , that the facts mentioned did naturally pour these moral reflections on the thought of the Writer .</p>

     <l n="8">Yet that were vain , if dreams infest the grave .</l>

     <l n="10">Tumultuous ; where my wreck 'd desponding thought 10</l>
     <l n="11">From wave to wave of fancied misery</l>

     <l n="21">Silence , how dead ! and darkness , how profound !</l>
     <l n="22">Nor eye , nor listening ear , an object finds ;</l>
     <l n="23">Creation sleeps . ‘ Tis as the general pulse 23</l>
     <l n="24">Of life stood still , and nature made a pause ;</l>
     <l n="25">An awful pause ! prophetic of her end .</l>

     <l n="27">Fate ! drop the curtain ; I can lose no more .</l>
     <l n="28">Silence and darkness : solemn sisters ! twins</l>
     <l n="29">From ancient Night , who nurse the tender thought</l>
     <l n="30">To reason , and on reason build resolve 30</l>
     <l n="31">( That column of true majesty in man ) ,</l>
     <l n="32">Assist me : I will thank you in the grave ;</l>
     <l n="33">The grave , your kingdom : there this frame shall fall</l>
     <l n="34">A victim sacred to your dreary shrine .</l>
     <l n="35">But what are ye ?—</l>

     <l n="39">O Thou , whose word from solid darkness struck</l>
     <l n="40">That spark , the sun ; strike wisdom from my soul ; 40</l>
     <l n="41">My soul , which flies to thee , her trust , her treasure ,</l>

     <l n="47">Lead it through various scenes of life and death ;</l>
     <l n="48">And from each scene the noblest truths inspire .</l>
     <l n="49">Nor less inspire my conduct , than my song ; 49</l>
     <l n="50">Teach my best reason , reason ; my best will</l>
     <l n="51">Teach rectitude ; and fix my firm resolve</l>
     <l n="52">Wisdom to wed , and pay her long arrear :</l>

     <l n="58">I feel the solemn sound . If heard aright ,</l>
     <l n="59">It is the knell of my departed hours :</l>
     <l n="60">Where are they ? With the years beyond the flood . 60</l>
     <l n="61">It is the signal that demands despatch :</l>
     <l n="62">How much is to be done ? My hopes and fears</l>
     <l n="63">Start up alarm 'd , and o'er life 's narrow verge</l>
     <l n="64">Look down — on what ? a fathomless abyss ;</l>

     <l n="370">By fate 's inviolable oath is sworn 370</l>
     <l n="371">Deep silence , “ where eternity begins . ”</l>
     <l n="372">By nature 's law , what may be , may be now ;</l>
     <l n="373">There 's no prerogative in human hours .</l>
     <l n="374">In human hearts what bolder thought can rise ,</l>
     <l n="375">Than man 's presumption on to-morrow 's dawn !</l>
     <l n="376">Where is to-morrow ? In another world .</l>
     <l n="377">For numbers this is certain ; the reverse</l>
     <l n="378">Is sure to none ; and yet on this perhaps ,</l>
     <l n="379">This peradventure , infamous for lies ,</l>
     <l n="380">As on a rock of adamant , we build 380</l>
     <l n="381">Our mountain hopes ; spin out eternal schemes ,</l>
     <l n="382">As we the fatal sisters could out-spin ,</l>
     <l n="383">And , big with life 's futurities , expire .</l>
     <l n="384">Not even Philander had bespoke his shroud ;</l>
     <l n="385">Nor had he cause ; a warning was denied . 385</l>
     <l n="386">How many fall as sudden , not as safe !</l>
     <l n="387">As sudden , though for years admonish 'd home .</l>
     <l n="388">Of human ills the last extreme beware ,</l>
     <l n="389">Beware , Lorenzo ! a slow sudden death .</l>
     <l n="390">How dreadful that deliberate surprise !</l>
     <l n="391">Be wise to-day ; ‘ tis madness to defer ;</l>
     <l n="392">Next day the fatal precedent will plead ; 392</l>
     <l n="393">Thus on , till wisdom is push 'd out of life .</l>
     <l n="394">Procrastination is the thief of time ;</l>
     <l n="395">Year after year it steals , till all are fled ,</l>
     <l n="396">And to the mercies of a moment leaves</l>
     <l n="397">The vast concerns of an eternal scene .</l>
     <l n="398">If not so frequent , would not this be strange ?</l>
     <l n="399">That ‘ tis so frequent , this is stranger still .</l>
     <l n="400">Of man 's miraculous mistakes , this bears 400</l>
     <l n="401">The palm , “ That all men are about to live , ”</l>
     <l n="402">For ever on the brink of being born .</l>
     <l n="403">All pay themselves the compliment to think</l>
     <l n="404">They one day shall not drivel : and their pride</l>
     <l n="405">On this reversion takes up ready praise ;</l>
     <l n="406">At least , their own ; their future selves applaud ;</l>
     <l n="407">How excellent that life they ne'er will lead !</l>
     <l n="408">Time lodged in their own hands is folly 's vails ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span></l>
     <l n="409">That lodged in fate 's , to wisdom they consign ;</l>
     <l n="410">The thing they can n't but purpose , they postpone ; 410</l>
     <l n="411">‘ Tis not in folly , not to scorn a fool ;</l>
     <l n="412">And scarce in human wisdom to do more .</l>
     <l n="413">All promise is poor dilatory man ,</l>
     <l n="414">And that through every stage : when young , indeed ,</l>
     <l n="415">In full content we , sometimes , nobly rest ,</l>
     <l n="416">Unanxious for ourselves ; and only wish ,</l>
     <l n="417">As duteous sons , our fathers were more wise .</l>
     <l n="418">At thirty , man suspects himself a fool ;</l>
     <l n="419">Knows it at forty , and reforms his plan ; 419</l>
     <l n="420">At fifty , chides his infamous delay ,</l>
     <l n="421">Pushes his prudent purpose to resolve ;</l>
     <l n="422">In all the magnanimity of thought</l>
     <l n="423">Resolves ; and re-resolves ; then dies the same .</l>
     <l n="424">And why ? Because he thinks himself immortal .</l>
     <l n="425">All men think all men mortal , but themselves :</l>
     <l n="426">Themselves , when some alarming shock of fate</l>
     <l n="427">Strikes through their wounded hearts the sudden dread ;</l>
     <l n="428">But their hearts wounded , like the wounded air ,</l>
     <l n="429">Soon close ; where pass 'd the shaft , no trace is found .</l>
     <l n="430">As from the wing no scar the sky retains ; 430</l>
     <l n="431">The parted wave no furrow from the keel ;</l>
     <l n="432">So dies in human hearts the thought of death .</l>
     <l n="433">Even with the tender tear which nature sheds</l>
     <l n="434">O'er those we love , we drop it in their grave .</l>
     <l n="435">Can I forget Philander ? That were strange !</l>
     <l n="436">O my full heart !—— But should I give it vent ,</l>
     <l n="437">The longest night , though longer far , would fail ,</l>
     <l n="438">And the lark listen to my midnight song .</l>
     <l n="439">The sprightly lark 's shrill matin wakes the morn ;</l>
     <l n="440">Grief 's sharpest thorn hard pressing on my breast , 440</l>
     <l n="441">I strive , with wakeful melody , to cheer</l>
     <l n="442">The sullen gloom , sweet Philomel ! like thee ,</l>
     <l n="443">And call the stars to listen : every star</l>
     <l n="444">Is deaf to mine , enamour 'd of thy lay .</l>
     <l n="445">Yet be not vain ; there are , who thine excel ,</l>
     <l n="446">And charm through distant ages : wrapt in shade ,</l>
     <l n="447">Prisoner of darkness ! to the silent hours ,</l>
     <l n="448">How often I repeat their rage divine ,</l>
     <l n="449">To lull my griefs , and steal my heart from woe !</l>
     <l n="450">I roll their raptures , but not catch their fire . 450</l>
     <l n="451">Dark , though not blind , like thee , Maeonides !<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span></l>
     <l n="452">Or , Milton ! thee ; ah , could I reach your strain ! 452</l>

     <l n="454">Man too he sung : immortal man I sing ;</l>
     <l n="455">Oft bursts my song beyond the bounds of life ;</l>
     <l n="456">What , now , but immortality , can please ?</l>
     <l n="457">O had he press 'd his theme , pursued the track ,</l>
     <l n="458">Which opens out of darkness into day !</l>
     <l n="459">O had he , mounted on his wing of fire ,</l>
     <l n="460">Soar 'd where I sink , and sung immortal man ! 460</l>

    <head>NIGHT SECOND .</head>
    <head>ON TIME , DEATH , AND FRIENDSHIP .</head>
     <l n="1">“ When the cock crew , he wept ” — smote by that eye</l>
     <l n="2">Which looks on me , on all : that Power , who bids</l>
     <l n="3">This midnight sentinel , with clarion shrill</l>
     <l n="4">( Emblem of that which shall awake the dead ) ,</l>
     <l n="5">Rouse souls from slumber , into thoughts of heaven .</l>
     <l n="6">Shall I too weep ? Where then is fortitude ?</l>
     <l n="7">And , fortitude abandon 'd , where is man ?</l>
     <l n="8">I know the terms on which he sees the light ;</l>
     <l n="9">He that is born , is listed ; life is war ;</l>
     <l n="10">Eternal war with woe . Who bears it best , 10</l>
     <l n="11">Deserves it least .— On other themes I 'll dwell .</l>
     <l n="12">Lorenzo ! let me turn my thoughts on thee ,</l>
     <l n="13">And thine , on themes may profit ; profit there ,</l>
     <l n="14">Where most thy need ; themes , too , the genuine growth</l>
     <l n="15">Of dear Philander 's dust . He thus , though dead ,</l>
     <l n="16">May still befriend — what themes ? Time 's wondrous price ,</l>
     <l n="17">Death , friendship , and Philander 's final scene .</l>
     <l n="18">So could I touch these themes , as might obtain</l>
     <l n="19">Thine ear , nor leave thy heart quite disengaged ,</l>
     <l n="20">The good deed would delight me ; half impress 20</l>
     <l n="21">On my dark cloud an Iris ; and from grief</l>
     <l n="22">Call glory .— Dost thou mourn Philander 's fate ?</l>
     <l n="23">I know thou say'st it : says thy life the same ?</l>
     <l n="24">He mourns the dead , who lives as they desire .</l>
     <l n="25">Where is that thrift , that avarice of time ,</l>
     <l n="26">( O glorious avarice ! ) thought of death inspires ,</l>
     <l n="27">As rumour 'd robberies endear our gold ?</l>
     <l n="28">O time ! than gold more sacred ; more a load</l>
     <l n="29">Than lead to fools ; and fools reputed wise .</l>
     <l n="30">What moment granted man without account ? 30</l>
     <l n="31">What years are squander 'd , wisdom 's debt unpaid !</l>
     <l n="32">Our wealth in days , all due to that discharge .</l>
     <l n="33">Haste , haste , he lies in wait , he 's at the door ,</l>
     <l n="34">Insidious Death ! should his strong hand arrest ,</l>
     <l n="35">No composition sets the prisoner free .</l>
     <l n="36">Eternity 's inexorable chain</l>
     <l n="37">Fast binds ; and vengeance claims the full arrear .</l>
     <l n="38">How late I shudder 'd on the brink ! how late</l>
     <l n="39">Life call 'd for her last refuge in despair !</l>
     <l n="40">That time is mine , O Mead ! to thee I owe ; 40</l>
     <l n="41">Fain would I pay thee with eternity .</l>
     <l n="42">But ill my genius answers my desire ;</l>
     <l n="43">My sickly song is mortal , past thy cure .</l>
     <l n="44">Accept the will ;— that dies not with my strain .</l>
     <l n="45">For what calls thy disease , Lorenzo ? not</l>
     <l n="46">For Esculapian , but for moral aid .</l>
     <l n="47">Thou think'st it folly to be wise too soon .</l>
     <l n="48">Youth is not rich in time , it may be poor ;</l>
     <l n="49">Part with it as with money , sparing ; pay</l>
     <l n="50">No moment , but in purchase of its worth ; 50</l>
     <l n="51">And what its worth , ask death-beds ; they can tell .</l>
     <l n="52">Part with it as with life , reluctant ; big</l>
     <l n="53">With holy hope of nobler time to come ;</l>
     <l n="54">Time higher aim 'd , still nearer the great mark 54</l>
     <l n="55">Of men and angels ; virtue more divine .</l>
     <l n="56">Is this our duty , wisdom , glory , gain ?</l>
     <l n="57">( These Heaven benign in vital union binds )</l>
     <l n="58">And sport we like the natives of the bough ,</l>
     <l n="59">When vernal suns inspire ? Amusement reigns</l>
     <l n="60">Man 's great demand : to trifle , is to live :</l>
     <l n="61">And is it then a trifle , too , to die ?</l>
     <l n="62">Thou say'st I preach , Lorenzo ! ‘ tis confess 'd . 62</l>
     <l n="63">What , if for once , I preach thee quite awake ?</l>
     <l n="64">Who wants amusement in the flame of battle ?</l>
     <l n="65">Is it not treason to the soul immortal ,</l>
     <l n="66">Her foes in arms , eternity the prize ?</l>
     <l n="67">Will toys amuse , when medicines cannot cure ?</l>
     <l n="68">When spirits ebb , when life 's enchanting scenes</l>
     <l n="69">Their lustre lose , and lessen in our sight ,</l>
     <l n="70">As lands , and cities with their glittering spires , 70</l>
     <l n="71">To the poor shatter 'd bark , by sudden storm</l>
     <l n="72">Thrown off to sea , and soon to perish there ?</l>
     <l n="73">Will toys amuse ? No : thrones will then be toys ,</l>
     <l n="74">And earth and skies seem dust upon the scale .</l>
     <l n="75">Redeem we time ?— its loss we dearly buy .</l>
     <l n="76">What pleads Lorenzo for his high-prized sports ?</l>
     <l n="77">He pleads time 's numerous blanks ; he loudly pleads</l>
     <l n="78">The straw-like trifles on life 's common stream .</l>
     <l n="79">From whom those blanks and trifles , but from thee ?</l>
     <l n="80">No blank , no trifle , nature made , or meant . 80</l>
     <l n="81">Virtue , or purposed virtue , still be thine ;</l>
     <l n="82">This cancels thy complaint at once , this leaves</l>
     <l n="83">In act no trifle , and no blank in time .</l>
     <l n="84">This greatens , fills , immortalizes all ;</l>
     <l n="85">This , the bless 'd art of turning all to gold ;</l>
     <l n="86">This , the good heart 's prerogative to raise</l>
     <l n="87">A royal tribute from the poorest hours ;</l>
     <l n="88">Immense revenue ! every moment pays . 88</l>
     <l n="89">If nothing more than purpose in thy power ;</l>
     <l n="90">Thy purpose firm , is equal to the deed :</l>
     <l n="91">Who does the best his circumstance allows ,</l>
     <l n="92">Does well , acts nobly ; angels could no more .</l>
     <l n="93">Our outward act , indeed , admits restraint ;</l>
     <l n="94">‘ Tis not in things o'er thought to domineer ;</l>
     <l n="95">Guard well thy thought ; our thoughts are heard in heaven .</l>
     <l n="96">On all-important time , through every age ,</l>
     <l n="97">Though much , and warm , the wise have urged ; the man</l>
     <l n="98">Is yet unborn , who duly weighs an hour .</l>
     <l n="99">“ I 've lost a day ” — the prince who nobly cried</l>
     <l n="100">Had been an emperor without his crown ; 100</l>
     <l n="101">Of Rome ? say , rather , lord of human race :</l>
     <l n="102">He spoke , as if deputed by mankind .</l>
     <l n="103">So should all speak ; so reason speaks in all :</l>
     <l n="104">From the soft whispers of that God in man ,</l>
     <l n="105">Why fly to folly , why to phrensy fly ,</l>
     <l n="106">For rescue from the blessing we possess ?</l>
     <l n="107">Time the supreme !— Time is eternity ;</l>
     <l n="108">Pregnant with all eternity can give ;</l>
     <l n="109">Pregnant with all that makes archangels smile .</l>
     <l n="110">Who murders time , he crushes in the birth 110</l>
     <l n="111">A power ethereal , only not adored .</l>
     <l n="112">Ah ! how unjust to Nature , and himself ,</l>
     <l n="113">Is thoughtless , thankless , inconsistent man !</l>
     <l n="114">Like children babbling nonsense in their sports ,</l>
     <l n="115">We censure Nature for a span too short ;</l>
     <l n="116">That span too short , we tax as tedious too ;</l>
     <l n="117">Torture invention , all expedients tire ,</l>
     <l n="118">To lash the lingering moments into speed ,</l>
     <l n="119">And whirl us ( happy riddance ! ) from ourselves .</l>
     <l n="120">Art , brainless Art ! our furious charioteer 120</l>
     <l n="121">( For Nature 's voice unstifled would recall ) ,</l>
     <l n="122">Drives headlong towards the precipice of death ; 122</l>
     <l n="123">Death , most our dread ; death thus more dreadful made :</l>
     <l n="124">Oh , what a riddle of absurdity !</l>
     <l n="125">Leisure is pain ; takes off our chariot wheels ;</l>
     <l n="126">How heavily we drag the load of life !</l>
     <l n="127">Blest leisure is our curse ; like that of Cain ,</l>
     <l n="128">It makes us wander ; wander earth around ,</l>
     <l n="129">To fly that tyrant , thought . As Atlas groan 'd</l>
     <l n="130">The world beneath , we groan beneath an hour . 130</l>
     <l n="131">We cry for mercy to the next amusement ;</l>
     <l n="132">The next amusement mortgages our fields ;</l>
     <l n="133">Slight inconvenience ! prisons hardly frown ,</l>
     <l n="134">From hateful time if prisons set us free .</l>
     <l n="135">Yet when Death kindly tenders us relief ,</l>
     <l n="136">We call him cruel ; years to moments shrink ,</l>
     <l n="137">Ages to years . The telescope is turn 'd .</l>
     <l n="138">To man 's false optics ( from his folly false ) ,</l>
     <l n="139">Time , in advance , behind him hides his wings ,</l>
     <l n="140">And seems to creep , decrepit with his age ; 140</l>
     <l n="141">Behold him , when pass 'd by ; what then is seen ,</l>
     <l n="142">But his broad pinions swifter than the winds ?</l>
     <l n="143">And all mankind , in contradiction strong ,</l>
     <l n="144">Rueful , aghast ! cry out on his career .</l>
     <l n="145">Leave to thy foes these errors and these ills ;</l>
     <l n="146">To Nature just , their cause and cure explore .</l>
     <l n="147">Not short Heaven 's bounty , boundless our expence ;</l>
     <l n="148">No niggard , Nature ; men are prodigals .</l>
     <l n="149">We waste , not use our time ; we breathe , not live .</l>
     <l n="150">Time wasted is existence , used is life . 150</l>
     <l n="151">And bare existence , man , to live ordain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="152">Wrings , and oppresses with enormous weight .</l>
     <l n="153">And why ? since time was given for use , not waste ,</l>
     <l n="154">Enjoin 'd to fly ; with tempest , tide , and stars ,</l>
     <l n="155">To keep his speed , nor ever wait for man ;</l>
     <l n="156">Time 's use was doom 'd a pleasure : waste , a pain ; 156</l>
     <l n="157">That man might feel his error , if unseen :</l>
     <l n="158">And , feeling , fly to labour for his cure ;</l>
     <l n="159">Not , blundering , split on idleness for ease .</l>
     <l n="160">Life 's cares are comforts ; such by Heaven design 'd ;</l>
     <l n="161">He that has none , must make them , or be wretched .</l>
     <l n="162">Cares are employments ; and without employ</l>
     <l n="163">The soul is on a rack ; the rack of rest , 163</l>
     <l n="164">To souls most adverse ; action all their joy .</l>
     <l n="165">Here then , the riddle , mark 'd above , unfolds ;</l>
     <l n="166">Then time turns torment , when man turns a fool .</l>
     <l n="167">We rave , we wrestle , with great Nature 's plan ;</l>
     <l n="168">We thwart the Deity ; and ‘ tis decreed ,</l>
     <l n="169">Who thwart his will shall contradict their own .</l>
     <l n="170">Hence our unnatural quarrels with ourselves ; 170</l>
     <l n="171">Our thoughts at enmity ; our bosom-broils ;</l>
     <l n="172">We push Time from us , and we wish him back ;</l>
     <l n="173">Lavish of lustrums , and yet fond of life ;</l>
     <l n="174">Life we think long , and short ; death seek , and shun ;</l>
     <l n="175">Body and soul , like peevish man and wife ,</l>
     <l n="176">United jar , and yet are loth to part .</l>
     <l n="177">Oh the dark days of vanity ! while here ,</l>
     <l n="178">How tasteless ! and how terrible , when gone !</l>
     <l n="179">Gone ! they ne'er go ; when past , they haunt us still ;</l>
     <l n="180">The spirit walks of every day deceased ; 180</l>
     <l n="181">And smiles an angel , or a fury frowns .</l>
     <l n="182">Nor death , nor life delight us . If time past ,</l>
     <l n="183">And time possess 'd , both pain us , what can please ?</l>
     <l n="184">That which the Deity to please ordain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="185">Time used . The man who consecrates his hours</l>
     <l n="186">By vigorous effort , and an honest aim ,</l>
     <l n="187">At once he draws the sting of life and death ;</l>
     <l n="188">He walks with Nature ; and her paths are peace .</l>
     <l n="189">Our error 's cause and cure are seen : see next</l>
     <l n="190">Time 's nature , origin , importance , speed ; 190</l>
     <l n="191">And thy great gain from urging his career .—</l>

     <l n="200">Lorenzo ! no : on the long-destined hour , 200</l>
     <l n="201">From everlasting ages growing ripe ,</l>
     <l n="202">That memorable hour of wondrous birth ,</l>
     <l n="203">When the Dread Sire , on emanation bent ,</l>

     <l n="207">Not on those terms , from the great days of heaven ,</l>
     <l n="208">From old Eternity 's mysterious orb ,</l>
     <l n="209">Was Time cut off , and cast beneath the skies ;</l>
     <l n="210">The skies , which watch him in his new abode , 210</l>
     <l n="211">Measuring his motions by revolving spheres ;</l>
     <l n="212">That horologe machinery divine .</l>
     <l n="213">Hours , days , and months , and years , his children play ,</l>
     <l n="214">Like numerous wings around him , as he flies :</l>
     <l n="215">Or , rather , as unequal plumes , they shape</l>
     <l n="216">His ample pinions , swift as darted flame ,</l>
     <l n="217">To gain his goal , to reach his ancient rest ,</l>
     <l n="218">And join anew Eternity his sire ;</l>

     <l n="254">How will you weather an eternal night ,</l>
     <l n="255">Where such expedients fail ?</l>
     <l n="256">O treacherous Conscience ! while she seems to sleep</l>
     <l n="257">On rose and myrtle , lull 'd with syren song ;</l>
     <l n="258">While she seems , nodding o'er her charge , to drop 258</l>

     <l n="262">The sly informer minutes every fault ,</l>
     <l n="263">And her dread diary with horror fills .</l>
     <l n="264">Not the gross act alone employs her pen ;</l>
     <l n="265">She reconnoitres fancy 's airy band ,</l>
     <l n="266">A watchful foe ! the formidable spy ,</l>
     <l n="267">Listening , o'erhears the whispers of our camp :</l>
     <l n="268">Our dawning purposes of heart explores ,</l>
     <l n="269">And steals our embryos of iniquity .</l>

     <l n="271">Their doomsday-book from all-consuming heirs ;</l>

     <l n="280">Lorenzo , such that sleeper in thy breast ! 280</l>
     <l n="281">Such is her slumber ; and her vengeance such</l>
     <l n="282">For slighted counsel ; such thy future peace !</l>
     <l n="283">And think'st thou still thou canst be wise too soon ?</l>
     <l n="284">But why on Time so lavish is my song ?</l>
     <l n="285">On this great theme kind Nature keeps a school ,</l>
     <l n="286">To teach her sons herself . Each night we die ,</l>
     <l n="287">Each morn are born anew : each day , a life !</l>
     <l n="288">And shall we kill each day ? If trifling kills ;</l>
     <l n="289">Sure vice must butcher . Oh , what heaps of slain</l>
     <l n="290">Cry out for vengeance on us ! Time destroy 'd 290</l>
     <l n="291">Is suicide , where more than blood is spilt .</l>
     <l n="292">Time flies , Death urges , knells call , Heaven invites , 292</l>
     <l n="293">Hell threatens : all exerts ; in effort , all ;</l>
     <l n="294">More than creation labours !— labours more ?</l>
     <l n="295">And is there in creation what , amidst</l>
     <l n="296">This tumult universal , wing 'd despatch ,</l>
     <l n="297">And ardent energy , supinely yawns ?—</l>
     <l n="298">Man sleeps ; and man alone ; and man , whose fate ,</l>
     <l n="299">Fate irreversible , entire , extreme ,</l>
     <l n="300">Endless , hair-hung , breeze-shaken , o'er the gulf 300</l>
     <l n="301">A moment trembles ; drops ! and man , for whom</l>
     <l n="302">All else is in alarm ! man , the sole cause</l>
     <l n="303">Of this surrounding storm ! and yet he sleeps ,</l>
     <l n="304">As the storm rock 'd to rest .— Throw years away ?</l>
     <l n="305">Throw empires , and be blameless . Moments seize ;</l>
     <l n="306">Heaven 's on their wing : a moment we may wish ,</l>
     <l n="307">When worlds want wealth to buy . Bid Day stand still ,</l>
     <l n="308">Bid him drive back his car , and re-import</l>
     <l n="309">The period past , re-give the given hour .</l>
     <l n="310">Lorenzo , more than miracles we want ; 310</l>
     <l n="311">Lorenzo — O for yesterdays to come !</l>
     <l n="312">Such is the language of the man awake ;</l>
     <l n="313">His ardour such , for what oppresses thee .</l>
     <l n="314">And is his ardour vain , Lorenzo ? No ;</l>
     <l n="315">That more than miracle the gods indulge ;</l>
     <l n="316">To-day is yesterday return 'd ; return 'd</l>
     <l n="317">Full power 'd to cancel , expiate , raise , adorn ,</l>
     <l n="318">And reinstate us on the rock of peace .</l>
     <l n="319">Let it not share its predecessor 's fate ;</l>
     <l n="320">Nor , like its elder sisters , die a fool . 320</l>
     <l n="321">Shall it evaporate in fume ? fly off</l>
     <l n="322">Fuliginous , and stain us deeper still ?</l>
     <l n="323">Shall we be poorer for the plenty pour 'd ?</l>
     <l n="324">More wretched for the clemencies of Heaven ?</l>
     <l n="325">Where shall I find him ? Angels ! tell me where .</l>
     <l n="326">You know him : he is near you : point him out : 326</l>
     <l n="327">Shall I see glories beaming from his brow ?</l>
     <l n="328">Or trace his footsteps by the rising flowers ?</l>
     <l n="329">Your golden wings , now hovering o'er him , shed</l>
     <l n="330">Protection ; now , are waving in applause</l>
     <l n="331">To that bless 'd son of foresight ! lord of fate !</l>
     <l n="332">That awful independent on to-morrow !</l>
     <l n="333">Whose work is done ; who triumphs in the past ; 333</l>
     <l n="334">Whose yesterdays look backwards with a smile ;</l>
     <l n="335">Nor , like the Parthian , wound him as they fly ;</l>
     <l n="336">That common but opprobrious lot ! past hours ,</l>
     <l n="337">If not by guilt , yet wound us by their flight ,</l>
     <l n="338">If folly bounds our prospect by the grave ,</l>
     <l n="339">All feeling of futurity benumb 'd ;</l>
     <l n="340">All god-like passion for eternals quench 'd ; 340</l>
     <l n="341">All relish of realities expired ;</l>
     <l n="342">Renounced all correspondence with the skies ;</l>
     <l n="343">Our freedom chain 'd ; quite wingless our desire ;</l>
     <l n="344">In sense dark-prison 'd all that ought to soar ;</l>
     <l n="345">Prone to the centre ; crawling in the dust ;</l>
     <l n="346">Dismounted every great and glorious aim ;</l>
     <l n="347">Embruted every faculty divine ;</l>
     <l n="348">Heart-buried in the rubbish of the world .</l>
     <l n="349">The world , that gulf of souls , immortal souls ,</l>
     <l n="350">Souls elevate , angelic , wing 'd with fire 350</l>
     <l n="351">To reach the distant skies , and triumph there</l>
     <l n="352">On thrones , which shall not mourn their masters changed ,</l>
     <l n="353">Though we from earth ; ethereal , they that fell .</l>
     <l n="354">Such veneration due , O man , to man .</l>
     <l n="355">Who venerate themselves , the world despise .</l>
     <l n="356">For what , gay friend ! is this escutcheon 'd world ,</l>
     <l n="357">Which hangs out death in one eternal night ?</l>
     <l n="358">A night , that glooms us in the noontide ray ,</l>
     <l n="359">And wraps our thought , at banquets , in the shroud .</l>
     <l n="360">Life 's little stage is a small eminence , 360</l>
     <l n="361">Inch-high the grave above ; that home of man ,</l>
     <l n="362">Where dwells the multitude : we gaze around ;</l>
     <l n="363">We read their monuments ; we sigh ; and while</l>
     <l n="364">We sigh , we sink ; and are what we deplored ;</l>
     <l n="365">Lamenting , or lamented , all our lot !</l>
     <l n="366">Is Death at distance ? No : he has been on thee ;</l>
     <l n="367">And given sure earnest of his final blow .</l>
     <l n="368">These hours that lately smiled , where are they now ?</l>
     <l n="369">Pallid to thought , and ghastly ! drown 'd , all drown 'd</l>
     <l n="370">In that great deep , which nothing disembogues ! 370</l>
     <l n="371">And , dying , they bequeathed thee small renown .</l>
     <l n="372">The rest are on the wing : how fleet their flight !</l>
     <l n="373">Already has the fatal train took fire ;</l>
     <l n="374">A moment , and the world 's blown up to thee ;</l>
     <l n="375">The sun is darkness , and the stars are dust .</l>
     <l n="376">‘ Tis greatly wise to talk with our past hours ;</l>
     <l n="377">And ask them , what report they bore to heaven ;</l>
     <l n="378">And how they might have borne more welcome news .</l>
     <l n="379">Their answers form what men experience call ;</l>
     <l n="380">If Wisdom 's friend , her best ; if not , worst foe . 380</l>
     <l n="381">“ Oh , reconcile them ! ” kind Experience cries ;</l>
     <l n="382">“ There 's nothing here , but what as nothing weighs ;</l>
     <l n="383">The more our joy , the more we know it vain ;</l>
     <l n="384">And by success are tutor 'd to despair . ”</l>
     <l n="385">Nor is it only thus , but must be so .</l>
     <l n="386">Who knows not this , though grey , is still a child .</l>
     <l n="387">Loose then from earth the grasp of fond desire ,</l>
     <l n="388">Weigh anchor , and some happier clime explore .</l>
     <l n="389">Art thou so moor 'd thou canst not disengage ,</l>
     <l n="390">Nor give thy thoughts a ply to future scenes ? 390</l>
     <l n="391">Since , by life 's passing breath , blown up from earth ,</l>
     <l n="392">Light as the summer 's dust , we take in air</l>
     <l n="393">A moment 's giddy flight , and fall again ;</l>
     <l n="394">Join the dull mass , increase the trodden soil , 394</l>
     <l n="395">And sleep , till earth herself shall be no more ;</l>
     <l n="396">Since then ( as emmets , their small world o'erthrown )</l>
     <l n="397">We , sore-amazed , from out earth 's ruins crawl ,</l>
     <l n="398">And rise to fate extreme of foul or fair ,</l>
     <l n="399">As man 's own choice ( controller of the skies ! )</l>
     <l n="400">As man 's despotic will , perhaps one hour</l>
     <l n="401">( O how omnipotent is time ! ) decrees ;</l>
     <l n="402">Should not each warning give a strong alarm ?</l>
     <l n="403">Warning , far less than that of bosom torn 403</l>
     <l n="404">From bosom , bleeding o'er the sacred dead !</l>
     <l n="405">Should not each dial strike us as we pass ,</l>
     <l n="406">Portentous , as the written wall , which struck ,</l>
     <l n="407">O'er midnight bowls , the proud Assyrian pale ,</l>
     <l n="408">Erewhile high-flush 'd , with insolence , and wine ?</l>
     <l n="409">Like that , the dial speaks ; and points to thee ,</l>
     <l n="410">Lorenzo ! loth to break thy banquet up : 410</l>
     <l n="411">“ O man , thy kingdom is departing from thee ;</l>
     <l n="412">And , while it lasts , is emptier than my shade . ”</l>
     <l n="413">Its silent language such : nor need'st thou call</l>
     <l n="414">Thy Magi , to decipher what it means .</l>
     <l n="415">Know , like the Median , fate is in thy walls :</l>
     <l n="416">Dost ask , How ? Whence ? Belshazzar-like , amazed ?</l>
     <l n="417">Man 's make encloses the sure seeds of death ;</l>
     <l n="418">Life feeds the murderer : ingrate ! he thrives</l>
     <l n="419">On her own meal , and then his nurse devours .</l>
     <l n="420">But , here , Lorenzo , the delusion lies ; 420</l>
     <l n="421">That solar shadow , as it measures life ,</l>
     <l n="422">It life resembles too : life speeds away</l>
     <l n="423">From point to point , though seeming to stand still .</l>
     <l n="424">The cunning fugitive is swift by stealth :</l>
     <l n="425">Too subtle is the movement to be seen ;</l>
     <l n="426">Yet soon man 's hour is up , and we are gone .</l>
     <l n="427">Warnings point out our danger ; gnomons , time :</l>
     <l n="428">As these are useless when the sun is set : 423</l>
     <l n="429">So those , but when more glorious reason shines .</l>
     <l n="430">Reason should judge in all ; in reason 's eye ,</l>
     <l n="431">That sedentary shadow travels hard .</l>
     <l n="432">But such our gravitation to the wrong ,</l>
     <l n="433">So prone our hearts to whisper what we wish ,</l>
     <l n="434">‘ Tis later with the wise than he 's aware :</l>
     <l n="435">A Wilmington goes slower than the sun :</l>
     <l n="436">And all mankind mistake their time of day ;</l>
     <l n="437">Even age itself . Fresh hopes are hourly sown</l>
     <l n="438">In furrow 'd brows . To gentle life 's descent</l>
     <l n="439">We shut our eyes , and think it is a plain .</l>
     <l n="440">We take fair days in winter , for the spring ; 440</l>
     <l n="441">And turn our blessings into bane . Since oft</l>
     <l n="442">Man must compute that age he cannot feel ,</l>
     <l n="443">He scarce believes he 's older for his years .</l>
     <l n="444">Thus , at life 's latest eve , we keep in store</l>
     <l n="445">One disappointment sure , to crown the rest ;</l>
     <l n="446">The disappointment of a promised hour .</l>
     <l n="447">On this , or similar , Philander ! thou ,</l>
     <l n="448">Whose mind was moral , as the preacher 's tongue ;</l>
     <l n="449">And strong , to wield all science , worth the name ;</l>
     <l n="450">How often we talk 'd down the summer 's sun , 450</l>
     <l n="451">And cool 'd our passions by the breezy stream !</l>
     <l n="452">How often thaw 'd and shorten 'd winter 's eve ,</l>
     <l n="453">By conflict kind , that struck out latent truth ,</l>
     <l n="454">Best found , so sought ; to the recluse more coy !</l>
     <l n="455">Thoughts disentangle passing o'er the lip ;</l>
     <l n="456">Clean runs the thread ; if not , ‘ tis thrown away ,</l>
     <l n="457">Or kept to tie up nonsense for a song ;</l>
     <l n="458">Song , fashionably fruitless ; such as stains</l>
     <l n="459">The fancy , and unhallow 'd passion fires ;</l>
     <l n="460">Chiming her saints to Cytherea 's<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>fane . 460</l>
     <l n="461">Know'st thou , Lorenzo ! what a friend contains ? 461</l>
     <l n="462">As bees mix 'd nectar draw from fragrant flowers ,</l>
     <l n="463">So men from friendship , wisdom and delight ;</l>
     <l n="464">Twins tied by Nature , if they part , they die .</l>
     <l n="465">Hast thou no friend to set thy mind abroach ?</l>
     <l n="466">Good sense will stagnate . Thoughts shut up , want air ,</l>
     <l n="467">And spoil , like bales unopen 'd to the sun .</l>
     <l n="468">Had thought been all , sweet speech had been denied ;</l>
     <l n="469">Speech , thought 's canal ! speech , thought 's criterion too !</l>
     <l n="470">Thought in the mine , may come forth gold , or dross ;</l>
     <l n="471">When coin 'd in words , we know its real worth . 471</l>
     <l n="472">If sterling , store it for thy future use ;</l>
     <l n="473">‘ Twill buy thee benefit ; perhaps , renown .</l>
     <l n="474">Thought , too , deliver 'd , is the more possess 'd ;</l>
     <l n="475">Teaching , we learn ; and , giving , we retain</l>
     <l n="476">The births of intellect ; when dumb , forgot .</l>
     <l n="477">Speech ventilates our intellectual fire ;</l>
     <l n="478">Speech burnishes our mental magazine ;</l>
     <l n="479">Brightens , for ornament ; and whets , for use .</l>
     <l n="480">What numbers , sheathed in erudition , lie , 480</l>
     <l n="481">Plunged to the hilts in venerable tomes ,</l>
     <l n="482">And rusted in ; who might have borne an edge ,</l>
     <l n="483">And play 'd a sprightly beam , if born to speech ;</l>
     <l n="484">If born bless 'd heirs of half their mother 's tongue !</l>
     <l n="485">‘ Tis thought 's exchange , which , like th ’ alternate push</l>
     <l n="486">Of waves conflicting , breaks the learned scum ,</l>
     <l n="487">And defecates the student 's standing pool .</l>
     <l n="488">In contemplation is his proud resource ?</l>
     <l n="489">‘ Tis poor , as proud , by converse unsustain 'd .</l>
     <l n="490">Rude thought runs wild in contemplation 's field ; 490</l>
     <l n="491">Converse , the menage , breaks it to the bit</l>
     <l n="492">Of due restraint ; and emulation 's spur</l>
     <l n="493">Gives graceful energy , by rivals awed .</l>
     <l n="494">‘ Tis converse qualifies for solitude ;</l>
     <l n="495">As exercise , for salutary rest . 495</l>
     <l n="496">By that untutor 'd , contemplation raves ;</l>
     <l n="497">And Nature 's fool , by wisdom is undone .</l>
     <l n="498">Wisdom , though richer than Peruvian mines ,</l>
     <l n="499">And sweeter than the sweet ambrosial hive ,</l>
     <l n="500">What is she , but the means of happiness ?</l>
     <l n="501">That unobtain 'd , than folly more a fool ;</l>
     <l n="502">A melancholy fool , without her bells .</l>
     <l n="503">Friendship , the means of wisdom , richly gives 503</l>
     <l n="504">The precious end , which makes our wisdom wise .</l>
     <l n="505">Nature , in zeal for human amity ,</l>
     <l n="506">Denies , or damps , an undivided joy .</l>
     <l n="507">Joy is an import ; joy is an exchange ;</l>
     <l n="508">Joy flies monopolists : it calls for two ;</l>
     <l n="509">Rich fruit ! heaven-planted ! never pluck 'd by one .</l>
     <l n="510">Needful auxiliars are our friends , to give 510</l>
     <l n="511">To social man true relish of himself .</l>
     <l n="512">Full on ourselves , descending in a line ,</l>
     <l n="513">Pleasure 's bright beam is feeble in delight :</l>
     <l n="514">Delight intense , is taken by rebound ;</l>
     <l n="515">Reverberated pleasures fire the breast .</l>
     <l n="516">Celestial happiness , whene'er she stoops</l>
     <l n="517">To visit earth , one shrine the goddess finds ,</l>
     <l n="518">And one alone , to make her sweet amends</l>
     <l n="519">For absent heaven — the bosom of a friend ;</l>
     <l n="520">Where heart meets heart , reciprocally soft , 520</l>
     <l n="521">Each other 's pillow to repose divine .</l>
     <l n="522">Beware the counterfeit : in passion 's flame</l>
     <l n="523">Hearts melt , but melt like ice , soon harder froze .</l>
     <l n="524">True love strikes root in reason ; passion 's foe :</l>
     <l n="525">Virtue alone entenders us for life :</l>
     <l n="526">I wrong her much — entenders us for ever :</l>
     <l n="527">Of friendship 's fairest fruits , the fruit most fair</l>
     <l n="528">Is virtue kindling at a rival fire ,</l>
     <l n="529">And , emulously , rapid in her race . 529</l>
     <l n="530">O the soft enmity ! endearing strife !</l>
     <l n="531">This carries friendship to her noontide point ,</l>
     <l n="532">And gives the rivet of eternity .</l>
     <l n="533">From friendship , which outlives my former themes ,</l>
     <l n="534">Glorious survivor of old time and death ;</l>
     <l n="535">From friendship , thus , that flower of heavenly seed ,</l>
     <l n="536">The wise extract earth 's most Hyblean bliss ,</l>
     <l n="537">Superior wisdom , crown 'd with smiling joy .</l>

     <l n="539">Abroad they find , who cherish it at home .</l>
     <l n="540">Lorenzo ! pardon what my love extorts , 540</l>
     <l n="541">An honest love , and not afraid to frown .</l>
     <l n="542">Though choice of follies fasten on the great ,</l>
     <l n="543">None clings more obstinate , than fancy , fond</l>
     <l n="544">That sacred friendship is their easy prey ;</l>
     <l n="545">Caught by the wafture of a golden lure ,</l>
     <l n="546">Or fascination of a high-born smile .</l>
     <l n="547">Their smiles , the great , and the coquette , throw out</l>
     <l n="548">For others ’ hearts , tenacious of their own ;</l>
     <l n="549">And we no less of ours , when such the bait .</l>
     <l n="550">Ye fortune 's cofferers ! ye powers of wealth ! 550</l>
     <l n="551">Can gold gain friendship ? Impudence of hope !</l>
     <l n="552">As well mere man an angel might beget .</l>
     <l n="553">Love , and love only , is the loan for love .</l>
     <l n="554">Lorenzo ! pride repress ; nor hope to find</l>
     <l n="555">A friend , but what has found a friend in thee .</l>
     <l n="556">All like the purchase ; few the price will pay ;</l>
     <l n="557">And this makes friends such miracles below .</l>
     <l n="558">What if ( since daring on so nice a theme )</l>
     <l n="559">I show thee friendship delicate , as dear ,</l>
     <l n="560">Of tender violations apt to die ? 560</l>
     <l n="561">Reserve will wound it ; and distrust , destroy .</l>
     <l n="562">Deliberate on all things with thy friend .</l>
     <l n="563">But since friends grow not thick on every bough , 563</l>
     <l n="564">Nor every friend unrotten at the core ;</l>
     <l n="565">First , on thy friend , deliberate with thyself ;</l>
     <l n="566">Pause , ponder , sift ; not eager in the choice ,</l>
     <l n="567">Nor jealous of the chosen ; fixing , fix ;</l>
     <l n="568">Judge before friendship , then confide till death .</l>
     <l n="569">Well , for thy friend ; but nobler far for thee ;</l>
     <l n="570">How gallant danger for earth 's highest prize ! 570</l>
     <l n="571">A friend is worth all hazards we can run .</l>
     <l n="572">“ Poor is the friendless master of a world :</l>
     <l n="573">A world in purchase for a friend is gain . ”</l>
     <l n="574">So sung he ( angels hear that angel sing !</l>
     <l n="575">Angels from friendship gather half their joy ) ,</l>
     <l n="576">So sung Philander , as his friend went round</l>
     <l n="577">In the rich ichor , in the generous blood</l>
     <l n="578">Of Bacchus , purple god of joyous wit ,</l>
     <l n="579">A brow solute , and ever-laughing eye .</l>
     <l n="580">He drank long health , and virtue , to his friend ; 580</l>
     <l n="581">His friend , who warm 'd him more , who more inspired .</l>
     <l n="582">Friendship 's the wine of life ; but friendship new</l>
     <l n="583">( Not such was his ) is neither strong , nor pure .</l>
     <l n="584">O for the bright complexion , cordial warmth ,</l>
     <l n="585">And elevating spirit , of a friend ,</l>
     <l n="586">For twenty summers ripening by my side ;</l>
     <l n="587">All feculence of falsehood long thrown down ;</l>
     <l n="588">All social virtues rising in his soul ;</l>
     <l n="589">As crystal clear ; and smiling , as they rise !</l>
     <l n="590">Here nectar flows ; it sparkles in our sight ; 590</l>
     <l n="591">Rich to the taste , and genuine from the heart .</l>
     <l n="592">High-flavour 'd bliss for gods ! on earth how rare !</l>
     <l n="593">On earth how lost !— Philander is no more .</l>
     <l n="594">Think'st thou the theme intoxicates my song ?</l>
     <l n="595">Am I too warm ?— Too warm I cannot be .</l>
     <l n="596">I loved him much ; but now I love him more .</l>
     <l n="597">Like birds , whose beauties languish , half-conceal 'd , 597</l>
     <l n="598">Till , mounted on the wing , their glossy plumes</l>
     <l n="599">Expanded shine with azure , green , and gold ;</l>
     <l n="600">How blessings brighten as they take their flight !</l>
     <l n="601">His flight Philander took ; his upward flight ,</l>
     <l n="602">If ever soul ascended . Had he dropp 'd</l>
     <l n="603">( That eagle genius ! ) , oh ! had he let fall</l>
     <l n="604">One feather as he flew ; I , then , had wrote , 604</l>
     <l n="605">What friends might flatter ; prudent foes forbear ;</l>
     <l n="606">Rivals scarce damn ; and Zoilus reprieve .</l>
     <l n="607">Yet what I can , I must : it were profane</l>
     <l n="608">To quench a glory lighted at the skies ,</l>
     <l n="609">And cast in shadows his illustrious close .</l>
     <l n="610">Strange ! the theme most affecting , most sublime , 610</l>
     <l n="611">Momentous most to man , should sleep unsung !</l>
     <l n="612">And yet it sleeps , by genius unawaked ,</l>
     <l n="613">Paynim or Christian ; to the blush of wit .</l>
     <l n="614">Man 's highest triumph ! man 's profoundest fall !</l>
     <l n="615">The death-bed of the just ! is yet undrawn</l>
     <l n="616">By mortal hand ; it merits a divine :</l>
     <l n="617">Angels should paint it , angels ever there ;</l>
     <l n="618">There , on a post of honour , and of joy .</l>
     <l n="619">Dare I presume , then ? But Philander bids ;</l>
     <l n="620">And glory tempts , and inclination calls — 620</l>
     <l n="621">Yet am I struck ; as struck the soul , beneath</l>
     <l n="622">Aerial groves ’ impenetrable gloom ;</l>
     <l n="623">Or , in some mighty ruin 's solemn shade ;</l>
     <l n="624">Or , gazing by pale lamps on high-born dust ,</l>
     <l n="625">In vaults ; thin courts of poor unflatter 'd kings ;</l>
     <l n="626">Or , at the midnight altar 's hallow 'd flame .</l>
     <l n="627">Is it religion to proceed ? I pause —</l>
     <l n="628">And enter , awed , the temple of my theme .</l>
     <l n="629">Is it his death-bed ? No : it is his shrine :</l>
     <l n="630">Behold him , there , just rising to a god . 630</l>
     <l n="631">The chamber where the good man meets his fate , 631</l>
     <l n="632">Is privileged beyond the common walk</l>
     <l n="633">Of virtuous life , quite in the verge of heaven .</l>
     <l n="634">Fly , ye profane ! if not , draw near with awe ,</l>
     <l n="635">Receive the blessing , and adore the chance ,</l>
     <l n="636">That threw in this Bethesda your disease ;</l>
     <l n="637">If unrestored by this , despair your cure .</l>
     <l n="638">For here , resistless demonstration dwells ;</l>
     <l n="639">A death-bed 's a detector of the heart .</l>
     <l n="640">Here tired Dissimulation drops her mask , 640</l>
     <l n="641">Through life 's grimace , that mistress of the scene !</l>
     <l n="642">Here real and apparent are the same .</l>
     <l n="643">You see the man ; you see his hold on heaven ;</l>
     <l n="644">If sound his virtue ; as Philander 's , sound .</l>
     <l n="645">Heaven waits not the last moment ; owns her friends</l>
     <l n="646">On this side death ; and points them out to men ,</l>
     <l n="647">A lecture , silent , but of sovereign power !</l>
     <l n="648">To vice , confusion ; and to virtue , peace .</l>
     <l n="649">Whatever farce the boastful hero plays ,</l>
     <l n="650">Virtue alone has majesty in death ; 650</l>
     <l n="651">And greater still , the more the tyrant frowns .</l>
     <l n="652">Philander ! he severely frown 'd on thee .</l>
     <l n="653">“ No warning given ! Unceremonious fate !</l>
     <l n="654">A sudden rush from life 's meridian joy !</l>
     <l n="655">A wrench from all we love ! from all we are !</l>
     <l n="656">A restless bed of pain ! a plunge opaque</l>

     <l n="658">Strong reason 's shudder at the dark unknown !</l>
     <l n="659">A sun extinguish 'd ! a just opening grave !</l>
     <l n="660">And , oh ! the last , last , what ? ( can words express ? 660</l>
     <l n="661">Thought reach it ? ) — the last — silence of a friend ! ”</l>
     <l n="662">Where are those horrors , that amazement , where ,</l>
     <l n="663">This hideous group of ills , which singly shock ,</l>
     <l n="664">Demand from man ?— I thought him man till now .</l>
     <l n="665">Through nature 's wreck , through vanquish 'd agonies</l>
     <l n="666">( Like the stars struggling through this midnight gloom ) ,</l>
     <l n="667">What gleams of joy ! what more than human peace !</l>
     <l n="668">Where , the frail mortal ? the poor abject worm ?</l>
     <l n="669">No , not in death , the mortal to be found .</l>
     <l n="670">His conduct is a legacy for all ; 670</l>
     <l n="671">Richer than Mammon 's for his single heir .</l>
     <l n="672">His comforters he comforts ; great in ruin ,</l>
     <l n="673">With unreluctant grandeur , gives , not yields ,</l>
     <l n="674">His soul sublime ; and closes with his fate .</l>
     <l n="675">How our hearts burn 'd within us at the scene !</l>
     <l n="676">Whence this brave bound o'er limits fix 'd to man ?</l>
     <l n="677">His God sustains him in his final hour !</l>
     <l n="678">His final hour brings glory to his God !</l>
     <l n="679">Man 's glory Heaven vouchsafes to call her own .</l>
     <l n="680">We gaze , we weep ; mix 'd tears of grief and joy ! 680</l>
     <l n="681">Amazement strikes ! devotion bursts to flame !</l>
     <l n="682">Christians adore ! and infidels believe !</l>
     <l n="683">As some tall tower ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>or lofty mountain 's brow ,</l>
     <l n="684">Detains the sun , illustrious , from its height ;</l>
     <l n="685">While rising vapours , and descending shades ,</l>
     <l n="686">With damps , and darkness , drown the spacious vale ;</l>
     <l n="687">Undamp 'd by doubt , undarken 'd by despair ,</l>
     <l n="688">Philander , thus , augustly rears his head ,</l>

     <l n="1">From dreams , where thought in fancy 's maze runs mad ,</l>
     <l n="2">To reason , that heaven-lighted lamp in man ,</l>
     <l n="3">Once more I wake ; and at the destined hour ,</l>

     <l n="6">Oh ! lost to virtue , lost to manly thought ,</l>
     <l n="7">Lost to the noble sallies of the soul !</l>
     <l n="8">Who think it solitude to be alone .</l>

     <l n="78">From the first blossom , from the buds of joy ;</l>
     <l n="79">Those few our noxious fate unblasted leaves</l>

     <l n="84">And happy ( if aught happy here ) as good !</l>
     <l n="85">For fortune fond had built her nest on high . 85</l>

     <l n="87">Transfix 'd by fate ( who loves a lofty mark ) ,</l>

     <l n="90">Extinguish 'd in the wonders of her song !</l>
     <l n="91">Her song still vibrates in my ravish 'd ear ,</l>

     <l n="100">Gay title of the deepest misery ! 100</l>

     <l n="247">And each distress , distinctly mourn 'd , demands</l>
     <l n="248">Of grief still more , as heighten 'd by the whole .</l>
     <l n="249">A grief like this proprietors excludes :</l>

     <l n="275">It brings us more than triple aid ; an aid</l>
     <l n="276">To chase our thoughtlessness , fear , pride , and guilt .</l>
     <l n="277">Our dying friends come o'er us like a cloud ,</l>

     <l n="285">Each friend by fate snatch 'd from us , is a plume</l>
     <l n="286">Pluck 'd from the wing of human vanity ,</l>
     <l n="287">Which makes us stoop from our aerial heights , 287</l>
     <l n="288">And , damp 'd with omen of our own decease ,</l>
     <l n="289">On drooping pinions of ambition lower 'd ,</l>
     <l n="290">Just skim earth 's surface , ere we break it up ,</l>
     <l n="291">O'er putrid earth to scratch a little dust ,</l>
     <l n="292">And save the world a nuisance . Smitten friends</l>

     <l n="297">Which wait the revolution in our hearts ?</l>
     <l n="298">Shall we disdain their silent soft address ;</l>
     <l n="299">Their posthumous advice , and pious prayer ?</l>
     <l n="300">Senseless , as herds that graze their hallow 'd graves , 300</l>
     <l n="301">Tread under foot their agonies and groans ;</l>

     <l n="303">Lorenzo ! no ; the thought of death indulge ;</l>
     <l n="304">Give it its wholesome empire ! let it reign ,</l>

     <l n="312">And song of every joy ? Surprising truth !</l>
     <l n="313">The beaten spaniel 's fondness not so strange .</l>
     <l n="314">To wave the numerous ills that seize on life</l>
     <l n="315">As their own property , their lawful prey ;</l>

     <l n="326">So shocking , they who wish , disown it too ;</l>
     <l n="327">Disown from shame what they from folly crave .</l>
     <l n="328">Live ever in the womb , nor see the light ?</l>
     <l n="329">For what live ever here ?— With labouring step</l>
     <l n="330">To tread our former footsteps ? pace the round 330</l>
     <l n="331">Eternal ? to climb life 's worn , heavy wheel ,</l>
     <l n="332">Which draws up nothing new ? to beat , and beat</l>
     <l n="333">The beaten track ? to bid each wretched day</l>
     <l n="334">The former mock ? to surfeit on the same ,</l>
     <l n="335">And yawn our joys ? or thank a misery</l>
     <l n="336">For change , though sad ? to see what we have seen ?</l>
     <l n="337">Hear , till unheard , the same old slabber 'd tale ?</l>
     <l n="338">To taste the tasted , and at each return</l>
     <l n="339">Less tasteful ? o'er our palates to decant</l>
     <l n="340">Another vintage ? strain a flatter year , 340</l>
     <l n="341">Through loaded vessels , and a laxer tone ?</l>
     <l n="342">Crazy machines to grind earth 's wasted fruits !</l>
     <l n="343">Ill-ground , and worse concocted ! load , not life !</l>
     <l n="344">The rational foul kennels of excess !</l>
     <l n="345">Still-streaming thoroughfares of dull debauch !</l>

     <l n="364">This hugg 'd , this hideous state , what art can cure ?</l>
     <l n="365">One only ; but that one , what all may reach ;</l>
     <l n="366">Virtue — she , wonder-working goddess ! charms</l>
     <l n="367">That rock to bloom ; and tames the painted shrew ;</l>
     <l n="368">And what will more surprise , Lorenzo ! gives</l>
     <l n="369">To life 's sick , nauseous iteration , change ;</l>
     <l n="370">And straightens nature 's circle to a line . 370</l>
     <l n="371">Believest thou this , Lorenzo ? lend an ear ,</l>
     <l n="372">A patient ear , thou'lt blush to disbelieve .</l>
     <l n="373">A languid , leaden iteration reigns ,</l>
     <l n="374">And ever must , o'er those , whose joys are joys</l>
     <l n="375">Of sight , smell , taste : the cuckoo-seasons sing</l>
     <l n="376">The same dull note to such as nothing prize ,</l>
     <l n="377">But what those seasons , from the teeming earth ,</l>
     <l n="378">To doating sense indulge . But nobler minds ,</l>
     <l n="379">Which relish fruits unripen 'd by the sun ,</l>
     <l n="380">Make their days various ; various as the dyes 380</l>
     <l n="381">On the dove 's neck , which wanton in his rays .</l>
     <l n="382">On minds of dove-like innocence possess 'd ,</l>
     <l n="383">On lighten 'd minds , that bask in virtue 's beams ,</l>
     <l n="384">Nothing hangs tedious , nothing old revolves</l>
     <l n="385">In that for which they long , for which they live .</l>
     <l n="386">Their glorious efforts , wing 'd with heavenly hope ,</l>
     <l n="387">Each rising morning sees still higher rise ;</l>
     <l n="388">Each bounteous dawn its novelty presents</l>
     <l n="389">To worth maturing , new strength , lustre , fame ; 389</l>
     <l n="390">While nature 's circle , like a chariot-wheel</l>
     <l n="391">Rolling beneath their elevated aims ,</l>
     <l n="392">Makes their fair prospect fairer every hour ;</l>
     <l n="393">Advancing virtue , in a line to bliss ;</l>
     <l n="394">Virtue , which Christian motives best inspire !</l>
     <l n="395">And bliss , which Christian schemes alone ensure !</l>
     <l n="396">And shall we then , for virtue 's sake , commence</l>
     <l n="397">Apostates , and turn infidels for joy ?</l>
     <l n="398">A truth it is , few doubt , but fewer trust ,</l>
     <l n="399">“ He sins against this life , who slights the next . ”</l>
     <l n="400">What is this life ? How few their favourite know ! 400</l>
     <l n="401">Fond in the dark , and blind in our embrace ,</l>
     <l n="402">By passionately loving life , we make</l>
     <l n="403">Loved life unlovely ; hugging her to death .</l>
     <l n="404">We give to time eternity 's regard ;</l>
     <l n="405">And , dreaming , take our passage for our port .</l>
     <l n="406">Life has no value as an end , but means ;</l>
     <l n="407">An end deplorable ! a means divine !</l>
     <l n="408">When ‘ tis our all , ‘ tis nothing ; worse than nought ;</l>
     <l n="409">A nest of pains : when held as nothing , much :</l>
     <l n="410">Like some fair humorists , life is most enjoy 'd , 410</l>
     <l n="411">When courted least ; most worth , when disesteem 'd ;</l>
     <l n="412">Then ‘ tis the seat of comfort , rich in peace ;</l>
     <l n="413">In prospect richer far ; important ! awful !</l>
     <l n="414">Not to be mention 'd , but with shouts of praise !</l>
     <l n="415">Not to be thought on , but with tides of joy !</l>
     <l n="416">The mighty basis of eternal bliss !</l>
     <l n="417">Where now the barren rock ? the painted shrew ?</l>
     <l n="418">Where now , Lorenzo ! life 's eternal round ?</l>
     <l n="419">Have I not made my triple promise good ?</l>
     <l n="420">Vain is the world ; but only to the vain . 420</l>
     <l n="421">To what compare we then this varying scene ,</l>
     <l n="422">Whose worth ambiguous rises , and declines ?</l>
     <l n="423">Waxes , and wanes ? ( In all propitious , night 423</l>
     <l n="424">Assists me here ) compare it to the moon ;</l>
     <l n="425">Dark in herself , and indigent ; but rich</l>
     <l n="426">In borrow 'd lustre from a higher sphere .</l>
     <l n="427">When gross guilt interposes , labouring earth ,</l>
     <l n="428">O'ershadow ' d , mourns a deep eclipse of joy ;</l>
     <l n="429">Her joys , at brightest , pallid , to that font</l>
     <l n="430">Of full effulgent glory , whence they flow . 430</l>
     <l n="431">Nor is that glory distant : Oh , Lorenzo !</l>
     <l n="432">A good man , and an angel ! these between</l>
     <l n="433">How thin the barrier ! What divides their fate ?</l>
     <l n="434">Perhaps a moment , or perhaps a year :</l>
     <l n="435">Or , if an age , it is a moment still ;</l>
     <l n="436">A moment , or eternity 's forgot .</l>
     <l n="437">Then be , what once they were , who now are gods ;</l>
     <l n="438">Be what Philander was , and claim the skies .</l>
     <l n="439">Starts timid nature at the gloomy pass ?</l>
     <l n="440">The soft transition call it ; and be cheer 'd : 440</l>
     <l n="441">Such it is often , and why not to thee ?</l>
     <l n="442">To hope the best , is pious , brave , and wise ;</l>
     <l n="443">And may itself procure , what it presumes .</l>
     <l n="444">Life is much flatter 'd , death is much traduced ;</l>
     <l n="445">Compare the rivals , and the kinder crown .</l>
     <l n="446">“ Strange competition ! ” — True , Lorenzo ! strange !</l>
     <l n="447">So little life can cast into the scale .</l>
     <l n="448">Life makes the soul dependent on the dust ;</l>
     <l n="449">Death gives her wings to mount above the spheres .</l>
     <l n="450">Through chinks , styled organs , dim life peeps at light ;</l>
     <l n="451">Death bursts th ’ involving cloud , and all is day ; 451</l>
     <l n="452">All eye , all ear , the disembodied power .</l>
     <l n="453">Death has feign 'd evils , nature shall not feel ;</l>
     <l n="454">Life , ills substantial , wisdom cannot shun .</l>
     <l n="455">Is not the mighty mind , that son of heaven !</l>
     <l n="456">By tyrant life dethroned , imprison 'd , pain 'd ?</l>
     <l n="457">By death enlarged , ennobled , deified ? 457</l>
     <l n="458">Death but entombs the body ; life the soul .</l>
     <l n="459">“ Is Death then guiltless ? How he marks his way</l>
     <l n="460">With dreadful waste of what deserves to shine !</l>
     <l n="461">Art , genius , fortune , elevated power !</l>
     <l n="462">With various lustres these light up the world ,</l>
     <l n="463">Which Death puts out , and darkens human race . ” 463</l>
     <l n="464">I grant , Lorenzo ! this indictment just :</l>
     <l n="465">The sage , peer , potentate , king , conqueror !</l>
     <l n="466">Death humbles these ; more barbarous life , the man .</l>
     <l n="467">Life is the triumph of our mouldering clay ;</l>
     <l n="468">Death , of the spirit infinite ! divine !</l>
     <l n="469">Death has no dread , but what frail life imparts ;</l>
     <l n="470">Nor life true joy , but what kind death improves . 470</l>
     <l n="471">No bliss has life to boast , till death can give</l>
     <l n="472">Far greater ; life 's a debtor to the grave ,</l>
     <l n="473">Dark lattice ! letting in eternal day .</l>
     <l n="474">Lorenzo ! blush at fondness for a life ,</l>
     <l n="475">Which sends celestial souls on errands vile ,</l>
     <l n="476">To cater for the sense ; and serve at boards ,</l>
     <l n="477">Where every ranger of the wilds , perhaps</l>
     <l n="478">Each reptile , justly claims our upper hand .</l>
     <l n="479">Luxurious feast ! a soul , a soul immortal ,</l>
     <l n="480">In all the dainties of a brute bemired ! 480</l>
     <l n="481">Lorenzo ! blush at terror for a death ,</l>
     <l n="482">Which gives thee to repose in festive bowers ,</l>
     <l n="483">Where nectars sparkle , angels minister ,</l>
     <l n="484">And more than angels share , and raise , and crown ,</l>
     <l n="485">And eternize , the birth , bloom , bursts of bliss .</l>
     <l n="486">What need I more ? O Death , the palm is thine .</l>
     <l n="487">Then welcome , Death ! thy dreaded harbingers ,</l>
     <l n="488">Age and disease ; disease , though long my guest ;</l>
     <l n="489">That plucks my nerves , those tender strings of life ;</l>
     <l n="490">Which , pluck 'd a little more , will toll the bell , 490</l>
     <l n="491">That calls my few friends to my funeral ; 491</l>
     <l n="492">Where feeble nature drops , perhaps , a tear ,</l>
     <l n="493">While reason and religion , better taught ,</l>
     <l n="494">Congratulate the dead , and crown his tomb</l>
     <l n="495">With wreath triumphant . Death is victory ;</l>
     <l n="496">It binds in chains the raging ills of life :</l>
     <l n="497">Lust and ambition , wrath and avarice ,</l>
     <l n="498">Dragg 'd at his chariot-wheel , applaud his power .</l>
     <l n="499">That ills corrosive , cares importunate ,</l>
     <l n="500">Are not immortal too , O Death ! is thine . 500</l>
     <l n="501">Our day of dissolution !— name it right ;</l>
     <l n="502">‘ Tis our great pay-day ; ‘ tis our harvest , rich</l>
     <l n="503">And ripe : what though the sickle , sometimes keen ,</l>
     <l n="504">Just scars us as we reap the golden grain ?</l>
     <l n="505">More than thy balm , O Gilead ! heals the wound .</l>
     <l n="506">Birth 's feeble cry , and death 's deep dismal groan ,</l>
     <l n="507">Are slender tributes low-tax 'd nature pays</l>
     <l n="508">For mighty gain : the gain of each , a life !</l>
     <l n="509">But O ! the last the former so transcends ,</l>
     <l n="510">Life dies , compared ; life lives beyond the grave . 510</l>
     <l n="511">And feel I , Death ! no joy from thought of thee ?</l>
     <l n="512">Death , the great counsellor , who man inspires</l>
     <l n="513">With every nobler thought , and fairer deed !</l>
     <l n="514">Death , the deliverer , who rescues man !</l>
     <l n="515">Death , the rewarder , who the rescued crowns !</l>
     <l n="516">Death , that absolves my birth ; a curse without it !</l>
     <l n="517">Rich death , that realises all my cares ,</l>
     <l n="518">Toils , virtues , hopes ; without it a chimera !</l>
     <l n="519">Death , of all pain the period , not of joy ;</l>
     <l n="520">Joy 's source , and subject , still subsist unhurt ; 520</l>
     <l n="521">One , in my soul ; and one , in her great Sire ;</l>
     <l n="522">Though the four winds were warring for my dust .</l>
     <l n="523">Yes , and from winds , and waves , and central night ,</l>
     <l n="524">Though prison 'd there , my dust too I reclaim</l>
     <l n="525">( To dust when drop proud nature 's proudest spheres ) ,</l>
     <l n="526">And live entire . Death is the crown of life : 526</l>
     <l n="527">Were death denied , poor man would live in vain ;</l>
     <l n="528">Were death denied , to live would not be life ;</l>
     <l n="529">Were death denied , even fools would wish to die .</l>
     <l n="530">Death wounds to cure : we fall ; we rise ; we reign !</l>
     <l n="531">Spring from our fetters ; fasten in the skies ;</l>
     <l n="532">Where blooming Eden withers in our sight :</l>
     <l n="533">Death gives us more than was in Eden lost .</l>
     <l n="534">This king of terrors is the prince of peace .</l>
     <l n="535">When shall I die to vanity , pain , death ?</l>
     <l n="536">When shall I die ?— When shall I live for ever ? 536</l>

   <p>THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH : CONTAINING OUR ONLY CURE FOR THE FEAR OF DEATH ; AND PROPER SENTIMENTS OF HEART ON THAT INESTIMABLE BLESSING .</p>
   <p>TO THE HONOURABLE MR YORKE .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>NIGHT FOURTH .</head>
    <head>THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH .</head>
     <l n="1">A much-indebted muse , O Yorke ! intrudes .</l>
     <l n="2">Amid the smiles of fortune , and of youth ,</l>
     <l n="3">Thine ear is patient of a serious song .</l>
     <l n="4">How deep implanted in the breast of man</l>
     <l n="5">The dread of death ! I sing its sovereign cure .</l>
     <l n="6">Why start at Death ? Where is he ? Death arrived ,</l>
     <l n="7">Is past ; not come , or gone , he 's never here .</l>
     <l n="8">Ere hope , sensation fails ; black-boding man</l>
     <l n="9">Receives , not suffers , Death 's tremendous blow .</l>
     <l n="10">The knell , the shroud , the mattock , and the grave ; 10</l>
     <l n="11">The deep damp vault , the darkness , and the worm ;</l>
     <l n="12">These are the bugbears of a winter 's eve ,</l>
     <l n="13">The terrors of the living , not the dead .</l>
     <l n="14">Imagination 's fool , and error 's wretch ,</l>
     <l n="15">Man makes a death , which nature never made ;</l>
     <l n="16">Then on the point of his own fancy falls ;</l>
     <l n="17">And feels a thousand deaths , in fearing one .</l>
     <l n="18">But were death frightful , what has age to fear ?</l>
     <l n="19">If prudent , age should meet the friendly foe ,</l>
     <l n="20">And shelter in his hospitable gloom . 20</l>
     <l n="21">I scarce can meet a monument , but holds</l>
     <l n="22">My younger ; every date cries — “ Come away . ”</l>
     <l n="23">And what recalls me ? Look the world around ,</l>
     <l n="24">And tell me what : the wisest cannot tell .</l>
     <l n="25">Should any born of woman give his thought</l>
     <l n="26">Full range , on just dislike 's unbounded field ;</l>
     <l n="27">Of things , the vanity ; of men , the flaws ;</l>
     <l n="28">Flaws in the best ; the many , flaw all o'er ;</l>
     <l n="29">As leopards , spotted , or , as Ethiops , dark ;</l>
     <l n="30">Vivacious ill ; good dying immature ; 30</l>
     <l n="31">( How immature , Narcissa 's marble tells ! )</l>
     <l n="32">And at his death bequeathing endless pain ;</l>
     <l n="33">His heart , though bold , would sicken at the sight ,</l>
     <l n="34">And spend itself in sighs , for future scenes .</l>
     <l n="35">But grant to life ( and just it is to grant</l>
     <l n="36">To lucky life ) some perquisites of joy ;</l>
     <l n="37">A time there is , when , like a thrice-told tale ,</l>
     <l n="38">Long-rifled life of sweet can yield no more ,</l>
     <l n="39">But from our comment on the comedy ,</l>
     <l n="40">Pleasing reflections on parts well sustain 'd , 40</l>
     <l n="41">Or purposed emendations where we fail 'd ,</l>
     <l n="42">Or hopes of plaudits from our candid Judge ,</l>
     <l n="43">When , on their exit , souls are bid unrobe ,</l>
     <l n="44">Toss fortune back her tinsel , and her plume ,</l>
     <l n="45">And drop this mask of flesh behind the scene .</l>
     <l n="46">With me , that time is come ; my world is dead ;</l>
     <l n="47">A new world rises , and new manners reign :</l>
     <l n="48">Foreign comedians , a spruce band ! arrive ,</l>
     <l n="49">To push me from the scene , or hiss me there .</l>
     <l n="50">What a pert race starts up ! the strangers gaze , 50</l>
     <l n="51">And I at them ; my neighbour is unknown ;</l>
     <l n="52">Nor that the worst : ah me ! the dire effect</l>
     <l n="53">Of loitering here , of Death defrauded long ;</l>
     <l n="54">Of old so gracious ( and let that suffice ) , 54</l>
     <l n="55">My very master knows me not .—</l>
     <l n="56">Shall I dare say , peculiar is the fate ?</l>
     <l n="57">I 've been so long remember 'd , I 'm forgot .</l>
     <l n="58">An object ever pressing dims the sight ,</l>
     <l n="59">And hides behind its ardour to be seen .</l>
     <l n="60">When in his courtiers ’ ears I pour my plaint , 60</l>
     <l n="61">They drink it as the nectar of the great ;</l>
     <l n="62">And squeeze my hand , and beg me come to-morrow .</l>
     <l n="63">Refusal ! canst thou wear a smoother form ?</l>
     <l n="64">Indulge me , nor conceive I drop my theme :</l>
     <l n="65">Who cheapens life , abates the fear of death :</l>
     <l n="66">Twice told the period spent on stubborn Troy ,</l>
     <l n="67">Court favour , yet untaken , I besiege ;</l>
     <l n="68">Ambition 's ill-judged effort to be rich .</l>
     <l n="69">Alas ! ambition makes my little less ;</l>
     <l n="70">Embittering the possess 'd : Why wish for more ? 70</l>
     <l n="71">Wishing , of all employments , is the worst ;</l>
     <l n="72">Philosophy 's reverse ; and health 's decay !</l>
     <l n="73">Were I as plump as stall 'd theology ,</l>
     <l n="74">Wishing would waste me to this shade again .</l>
     <l n="75">Were I as wealthy as a South Sea dream ,</l>
     <l n="76">Wishing is an expedient to be poor .</l>
     <l n="77">Wishing , that constant hectic of a fool ;</l>
     <l n="78">Caught at a court ; purged off by purer air ,</l>
     <l n="79">And simpler diet ; gifts of rural life !</l>
     <l n="80">Bless 'd be that hand divine , which gently laid 80</l>
     <l n="81">My heart at rest , beneath this humble shed .</l>
     <l n="82">The world 's a stately bark , on dangerous seas ,</l>
     <l n="83">With pleasure seen , but boarded at our peril ;</l>
     <l n="84">Here , on a single plank , thrown safe ashore ,</l>
     <l n="85">I hear the tumult of the distant throng ,</l>
     <l n="86">As that of seas remote , or dying storms :</l>
     <l n="87">And meditate on scenes , more silent still ;</l>
     <l n="88">Pursue my theme , and fight the fear of death . 88</l>
     <l n="89">Here , like a shepherd gazing from his hut ,</l>
     <l n="90">Touching his reed , or leaning on his staff ,</l>
     <l n="91">Eager ambition 's fiery chace I see ;</l>
     <l n="92">I see the circling hunt , of noisy men ,</l>
     <l n="93">Burst law 's enclosure , leap the mounds of right ,</l>
     <l n="94">Pursuing , and pursued , each other 's prey ;</l>
     <l n="95">As wolves , for rapine ; as the fox , for wiles ;</l>
     <l n="96">Till Death , that mighty hunter , earths them all .</l>
     <l n="97">Why all this toil for triumphs of an hour ?</l>
     <l n="98">What though we wade in wealth , or soar in fame ?</l>
     <l n="99">Earth 's highest station ends in “ Here he lies : ”</l>
     <l n="100">And “ Dust to dust ” concludes her noblest song . 100</l>
     <l n="101">If this song lives , posterity shall know</l>
     <l n="102">One , though in Britain born , with courtiers bred ,</l>
     <l n="103">Who thought even gold might come a day too late ;</l>
     <l n="104">Nor on his subtle death-bed plann 'd his scheme</l>
     <l n="105">For future vacancies in Church or State ;</l>
     <l n="106">Some avocation deeming it — to die ,</l>
     <l n="107">Unbit by rage canine of dying rich ;</l>
     <l n="108">Guilt 's blunder ! and the loudest laugh of hell .</l>
     <l n="109">O my coevals ! remnants of yourselves !</l>
     <l n="110">Poor human ruins , tottering o'er the grave ! 110</l>
     <l n="111">Shall we , shall aged men , like aged trees ,</l>
     <l n="112">Strike deeper their vile root , and closer cling ,</l>
     <l n="113">Still more enamour 'd of this wretched soil ?</l>
     <l n="114">Shall our pale , wither 'd hands , be still stretch 'd out ,</l>
     <l n="115">Trembling , at once , with eagerness and age ?</l>

     <l n="699">Of angels new ; of angels from the tomb .</l>
     <l n="700">Is this by fancy thrown remote ? and rise</l>
     <l n="701">Dark doubts between the promise and event ?</l>
     <l n="702">I send thee not to volumes for thy cure ;</l>
     <l n="703">Read nature ; nature is a friend to truth ;</l>
     <l n="704">Nature is Christian ; preaches to mankind ;</l>
     <l n="705">And bids dead matter aid us in our creed .</l>
     <l n="706">Hast thou ne'er seen the comet 's flaming flight ?</l>
     <l n="707">Th ’ illustrious stranger passing , terror sheds</l>
     <l n="708">On gazing nations ; from his fiery train</l>
     <l n="709">Of length enormous , takes his ample round 709</l>
     <l n="710">Through depths of ether ; coasts unnumber 'd worlds ,</l>
     <l n="711">Of more than solar glory ; doubles wide</l>
     <l n="712">Heaven 's mighty cape ; and then revisits earth ,</l>
     <l n="713">From the long travel of a thousand years .</l>
     <l n="714">Thus , at the destined period , shall return</l>
     <l n="715">He , once on earth , who bids the comet blaze :</l>
     <l n="716">And , with him , all our triumph o'er the tomb .</l>
     <l n="717">Nature is dumb on this important point ;</l>
     <l n="718">Or hope precarious in low whisper breathes ;</l>
     <l n="719">Faith speaks aloud , distinct ; even adders hear ;</l>
     <l n="720">But turn , and dart into the dark again . 720</l>
     <l n="721">Faith builds a bridge across the gulf of death ,</l>
     <l n="722">To break the shock blind nature cannot shun ,</l>
     <l n="723">And lands thought smoothly on the farther shore .</l>
     <l n="724">Death 's terror is the mountain faith removes ;</l>
     <l n="725">That mountain barrier between man and peace .</l>
     <l n="726">‘ Tis faith disarms destruction ; and absolves</l>
     <l n="727">From every clamorous charge , the guiltless tomb .</l>
     <l n="728">Why disbelieve ? Lorenzo !— “ Reason bids ,</l>
     <l n="729">All-sacred reason . ” — Hold her sacred still ;</l>
     <l n="730">Nor shalt thou want a rival in thy flame : 730</l>
     <l n="731">All-sacred reason ! source , and soul , of all</l>
     <l n="732">Demanding praise , on earth , or earth above ! 732</l>
     <l n="733">My heart is thine : deep in its inmost folds ,</l>
     <l n="734">Live thou with life ; live dearer of the two .</l>
     <l n="735">Wear I the blessed cross , by fortune stamp 'd</l>
     <l n="736">On passive nature , before thought was born ?</l>
     <l n="737">My birth 's blind bigot ! fired with local zeal !</l>
     <l n="738">No ; reason re-baptized me when adult ;</l>
     <l n="739">Weigh 'd true , and false , in her impartial scale ;</l>
     <l n="740">My heart became the convert of my head ; 740</l>
     <l n="741">And made that choice , which once was but my fate .</l>
     <l n="742">“ On argument alone my faith is built : ”</l>
     <l n="743">Reason pursued is faith ; and , unpursued</l>
     <l n="744">Where proof invites , ‘ tis reason , then , no more :</l>
     <l n="745">And such our proof , that , or our faith is right ,</l>
     <l n="746">Or reason lies , and Heaven design 'd it wrong :</l>
     <l n="747">Absolve we this ? What , then , is blasphemy ?</l>
     <l n="748">Fond as we are , and justly fond , of faith ,</l>
     <l n="749">Reason , we grant , demands our first regard ;</l>
     <l n="750">The mother honour 'd , as the daughter dear . 750</l>
     <l n="751">Reason the root , fair faith is but the flower ;</l>
     <l n="752">The fading flower shall die ; but reason lives</l>
     <l n="753">Immortal , as her Father in the skies .</l>
     <l n="754">When faith is virtue , reason makes it so .</l>
     <l n="755">Wrong not the Christian ; think not reason yours :</l>
     <l n="756">‘ Tis reason our great Master holds so dear ;</l>
     <l n="757">‘ Tis reason 's injured rights his wrath resents ;</l>
     <l n="758">‘ Tis reason 's voice obey 'd his glories crown ;</l>
     <l n="759">To give lost reason life , he pour 'd his own :</l>
     <l n="760">Believe , and show the reason of a man ; 760</l>
     <l n="761">Believe , and taste the pleasure of a God ;</l>
     <l n="762">Believe , and look with triumph on the tomb :</l>
     <l n="763">Through reason 's wounds alone thy faith can die ;</l>
     <l n="764">Which dying , tenfold terror gives to death ,</l>
     <l n="765">And dips in venom his twice-mortal sting .</l>
     <l n="766">Learn hence what honours , what loud paeans<span type="note_anchor">[ 16 ]</span>, due 766</l>
     <l n="767">To those , who push our antidote aside ;</l>
     <l n="768">Those boasted friends to reason , and to man ,</l>
     <l n="769">Whose fatal love stabs every joy , and leaves</l>
     <l n="770">Death 's terror heighten 'd , gnawing on his heart .</l>
     <l n="771">Those pompous sons of reason idolized</l>
     <l n="772">And vilified at once ; of reason dead ,</l>
     <l n="773">Then deified , as monarchs were of old ; 773</l>
     <l n="774">What conduct plants proud laurels on their brow ?</l>
     <l n="775">While love of truth through all their camp resounds ,</l>
     <l n="776">They draw pride 's curtain o'er the noontide ray ,</l>
     <l n="777">Spike up their inch of reason , on the point</l>
     <l n="778">Of philosophic wit , call 'd argument ;</l>
     <l n="779">And then , exulting in their taper , cry ,</l>
     <l n="780">“ Behold the sun ! ” and , Indian-like , adore . 780</l>
     <l n="781">Talk they of morals ? O thou bleeding Love !</l>
     <l n="782">Thou maker of new morals to mankind !</l>
     <l n="783">The grand morality is love of thee .</l>
     <l n="784">As wise as Socrates , if such they were</l>
     <l n="785">( Nor will they bate of that sublime renown ) ,</l>
     <l n="786">As wise as Socrates , might justly stand</l>
     <l n="787">The definition of a modern fool .</l>
     <l n="788">A Christian is the highest style of man :</l>
     <l n="789">And is there , who the blessed cross wipes off ,</l>
     <l n="790">As a foul blot from his dishonour 'd brow ? 790</l>
     <l n="791">If angels tremble , ‘ tis at such a sight :</l>
     <l n="792">The wretch they quit , desponding of their charge ,</l>
     <l n="793">More struck with grief or wonder , who can tell ?</l>
     <l n="794">Ye sold to sense ! ye citizens of earth !</l>
     <l n="795">( For such alone the Christian banner fly )</l>
     <l n="796">Know ye how wise your choice , how great your gain ?</l>
     <l n="797">Behold the picture of earth 's happiest man :</l>
     <l n="798">“ He calls his wish , it comes ; he sends it back ,</l>
     <l n="799">And says , he call 'd another ; that arrives ,</l>
     <l n="800">Meets the same welcome ; yet he still calls on ; 800</l>
     <l n="801">Till one calls him , who varies not his call ,</l>
     <l n="802">But holds him fast , in chains of darkness bound ,</l>
     <l n="803">Till nature dies , and judgment sets him free ;</l>
     <l n="804">A freedom far less welcome than his chain . ”</l>
     <l n="805">But grant man happy ; grant him happy long ;</l>
     <l n="806">Add to life 's highest prize her latest hour ;</l>
     <l n="807">That hour , so late , is nimble in approach ,</l>
     <l n="808">That , like a post , comes on in full career :</l>
     <l n="809">How swift the shuttle flies that weaves thy shroud !</l>
     <l n="810">Where is the fable of thy former years ? 810</l>
     <l n="811">Thrown down the gulf of time ; as far from thee</l>
     <l n="812">As they had ne'er been thine ; the day in hand ,</l>
     <l n="813">Like a bird struggling to get loose , is going ;</l>
     <l n="814">Scarce now possess 'd , so suddenly ‘ tis gone ;</l>
     <l n="815">And each swift moment fled , is death advanced</l>
     <l n="816">By strides as swift . Eternity is all ;</l>
     <l n="817">And whose eternity ? Who triumphs there ?</l>
     <l n="818">Bathing for ever in the font of bliss !</l>
     <l n="819">For ever basking in the Deity !</l>
     <l n="820">Lorenzo ! who ?— Thy conscience shall reply . 820</l>
     <l n="821">O give it leave to speak ! ‘ twill speak ere long ,</l>
     <l n="822">Thy leave unask 'd ; Lorenzo ! hear it now ,</l>
     <l n="823">While useful its advice , its accents mild .</l>
     <l n="824">By the great edict , the divine decree ,</l>
     <l n="825">Truth is deposited with man 's last hour ;</l>
     <l n="826">An honest hour , and faithful to her trust ;</l>
     <l n="827">Truth , eldest daughter of the Deity ;</l>
     <l n="828">Truth , of his council , when he made the worlds ;</l>
     <l n="829">Nor less , when he shall judge the worlds he made ;</l>
     <l n="830">Though silent long , and sleeping ne'er so sound , 830</l>
     <l n="831">Smother 'd with errors , and oppress 'd with toys ,</l>
     <l n="832">That heaven-commission 'd hour no sooner calls ,</l>
     <l n="833">But from her cavern in the soul 's abyss ,</l>
     <l n="834">Like him they fable under AEtna whelm 'd , 834</l>
     <l n="835">The goddess bursts in thunder , and in flame ;</l>
     <l n="836">Loudly convinces , and severely pains .</l>
     <l n="837">Dark demons I discharge , and hydra-stings ;</l>
     <l n="838">The keen vibration of bright truth — is hell :</l>
     <l n="839">Just definition ! though by schools untaught .</l>
     <l n="840">Ye deaf to truth ! peruse this parson 'd page , 840</l>
     <l n="841">And trust , for once , a prophet , and a priest ;</l>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>NIGHT FIFTH .</head>
    <head>THE RELAPSE .</head>
     <l n="1">Lorenzo ! to recriminate is just .</l>
     <l n="2">Fondness for fame is avarice of air .</l>
     <l n="3">I grant the man is vain who writes for praise .</l>
     <l n="4">Praise no man e'er deserved , who sought no more .</l>
     <l n="5">As just thy second charge . I grant the Muse</l>
     <l n="6">Has often blush 'd at her degenerate sons ,</l>
     <l n="7">Retain 'd by sense to plead her filthy cause ;</l>
     <l n="8">To raise the low , to magnify the mean ,</l>
     <l n="9">And subtilize the gross into refined :</l>
     <l n="10">As if to magic numbers ’ powerful charm 10</l>
     <l n="11">‘ Twas given , to make a civet of their song</l>
     <l n="12">Obscene , and sweeten ordure to perfume .</l>
     <l n="13">Wit , a true Pagan , deifies the brute ,</l>
     <l n="14">And lifts our swine-enjoyments from the mire .</l>
     <l n="15">The fact notorious , nor obscure the cause .</l>
     <l n="16">We wear the chains of pleasure and of pride .</l>
     <l n="17">These share the man ; and these distract him too ;</l>
     <l n="18">Draw different ways , and clash in their commands .</l>
     <l n="19">Pride , like an eagle , builds among the stars ;</l>
     <l n="20">But pleasure , lark-like , nests upon the ground . 20</l>
     <l n="21">Joys shared by brute creation , pride resents ; 21</l>
     <l n="22">Pleasure embraces : man would both enjoy ,</l>
     <l n="23">And both at once : a point so hard , how gain !</l>
     <l n="24">But , what can n't wit , when stung by strong desire ?</l>
     <l n="25">Wit dares attempt this arduous enterprise .</l>
     <l n="26">Since joys of sense can n't rise to reason 's taste ;</l>
     <l n="27">In subtle sophistry 's laborious forge ,</l>
     <l n="28">Wit hammers out a reason new , that stoops</l>
     <l n="29">To sordid scenes , and meets them with applause .</l>
     <l n="30">Wit calls the graces the chaste zone to loose ; 30</l>
     <l n="31">Nor less than a plump god to fill the bowl :</l>
     <l n="32">A thousand phantoms , and a thousand spells ,</l>
     <l n="33">A thousand opiates scatters , to delude ,</l>
     <l n="34">To fascinate , inebriate , lay asleep ,</l>
     <l n="35">And the fool 'd mind delightfully confound .</l>
     <l n="36">Thus that which shock 'd the judgment , shocks no more ;</l>
     <l n="37">That which gave Pride offence , no more offends .</l>
     <l n="38">Pleasure and Pride , by nature mortal foes ,</l>
     <l n="39">At war eternal , which in man shall reign ,</l>
     <l n="40">By Wit 's address , patch up a fatal peace , 40</l>
     <l n="41">And hand in hand lead on the rank debauch ,</l>
     <l n="42">From rank refined to delicate and gay .</l>
     <l n="43">Art , cursed Art ! wipes off th ’ indebted blush</l>
     <l n="44">From Nature 's cheek , and bronzes every shame .</l>
     <l n="45">Man smiles in ruin , glories in his guilt ,</l>
     <l n="46">And infamy stands candidate for praise .</l>
     <l n="47">All writ by man in favour of the soul ,</l>
     <l n="48">These sensual ethics far , in bulk , transcend .</l>
     <l n="49">The flowers of eloquence , profusely pour 'd</l>
     <l n="50">O'er spotted vice , fill half the letter 'd world . 50</l>
     <l n="51">Can powers of genius exorcise their page ,</l>
     <l n="52">And consecrate enormities with song ?</l>
     <l n="53">But let not these inexpiable strains</l>
     <l n="54">Condemn the Muse that knows her dignity ;</l>
     <l n="55">Nor meanly stops at time , but holds the world 55</l>
     <l n="56">As ‘ tis , in nature 's ample field , a point ,</l>
     <l n="57">A point in her esteem ; from whence to start ,</l>
     <l n="58">And run the round of universal space ,</l>
     <l n="59">To visit being universal there ,</l>
     <l n="60">And being 's source , that utmost flight of mind !</l>
     <l n="61">Yet , spite of this so vast circumference ,</l>
     <l n="62">Well knows , but what is moral , nought is great . 62</l>
     <l n="63">Sing syrens only ? Do not angels sing ?</l>
     <l n="64">There is in Poesy a decent pride ,</l>
     <l n="65">Which well becomes her when she speaks to Prose ,</l>
     <l n="66">Her younger sister ; haply , not more wise .</l>
     <l n="67">Think'st thou , Lorenzo ! to find pastimes here ?</l>
     <l n="68">No guilty passion blown into a flame ,</l>
     <l n="69">No foible flatter 'd , dignity disgraced ,</l>
     <l n="70">No fairy field of fiction , all on flower , 70</l>
     <l n="71">No rainbow colours here , or silken tale :</l>
     <l n="72">But solemn counsels , images of awe ,</l>
     <l n="73">Truths , which eternity lets fall on man</l>
     <l n="74">With double weight , through these revolving spheres ,</l>
     <l n="75">This death-deep silence , and incumbent shade :</l>
     <l n="76">Thoughts , such as shall revisit your last hour ;</l>
     <l n="77">Visit uncall 'd , and live when life expires ;</l>
     <l n="78">And thy dark pencil , Midnight ! darker still</l>
     <l n="79">In melancholy dipp 'd , embrowns the whole .</l>
     <l n="80">Yet this , even this , my laughter-loving friends ! 80</l>
     <l n="81">Lorenzo ! and thy brothers of the smile !</l>
     <l n="82">If , what imports you most , can most engage ,</l>
     <l n="83">Shall steal your ear , and chain you to my song .</l>
     <l n="84">Or if you fail me , know , the wise shall taste</l>
     <l n="85">The truths I sing ; the truths I sing shall feel ;</l>
     <l n="86">And , feeling , give assent ; and their assent</l>
     <l n="87">Is ample recompence ; is more than praise .</l>
     <l n="88">But chiefly thine , O Lichfield ! nor mistake ;</l>
     <l n="89">Think not unintroduced I force my way ; 89</l>
     <l n="90">Narcissa , not unknown , not unallied ,</l>
     <l n="91">By virtue , or by blood , illustrious youth !</l>
     <l n="92">To thee , from blooming amaranthine bowers ,</l>
     <l n="93">Where all the language harmony , descends</l>
     <l n="94">Uncall 'd , and asks admittance for the Muse :</l>
     <l n="95">A Muse that will not pain thee with thy praise ;</l>
     <l n="96">Thy praise she drops , by nobler still inspired .</l>
     <l n="97">O Thou ! Blest Spirit ! whether the supreme ,</l>
     <l n="98">Great antemundane Father ! in whose breast</l>
     <l n="99">Embryo creation , unborn being , dwelt ,</l>
     <l n="100">And all its various revolutions roll 'd 100</l>
     <l n="101">Present , though future ; prior to themselves ;</l>
     <l n="102">Whose breath can blow it into nought again ;</l>
     <l n="103">Or , from his throne some delegated power ,</l>
     <l n="104">Who , studious of our peace , dost turn the thought</l>
     <l n="105">From vain and vile , to solid and sublime !</l>
     <l n="106">Unseen thou lead'st me to delicious draughts</l>
     <l n="107">Of inspiration , from a purer stream ,</l>
     <l n="108">And fuller of the god , than that which burst</l>
     <l n="109">From famed Castalia : nor is yet allay 'd</l>
     <l n="110">My sacred thirst ; though long my soul has ranged 110</l>
     <l n="111">Through pleasing paths of moral , and divine ,</l>
     <l n="112">By Thee sustain 'd , and lighted by the stars .</l>
     <l n="113">By them best lighted are the paths of thought :</l>
     <l n="114">Nights are their days , their most illumined hours .</l>
     <l n="115">By day , the soul , o'erborne by life 's career ,</l>
     <l n="116">Stunn 'd by the din , and giddy with the glare ,</l>
     <l n="117">Reels far from reason , jostled by the throng .</l>
     <l n="118">By day the soul is passive , all her thoughts</l>
     <l n="119">Imposed , precarious , broken ere mature .</l>
     <l n="120">By night , from objects free , from passion cool , 120</l>
     <l n="121">Thoughts uncontroll 'd , and unimpress 'd , the births</l>
     <l n="122">Of pure election , arbitrary range ,</l>
     <l n="123">Not to the limits of one world confined ; 123</l>
     <l n="124">But from ethereal travels light on earth ,</l>
     <l n="125">As voyagers drop anchor , for repose .</l>
     <l n="126">Let Indians , and the gay , like Indians , fond</l>
     <l n="127">Of feather 'd fopperies , the sun adore :</l>
     <l n="128">Darkness has more divinity for me ;</l>
     <l n="129">It strikes thought inward ; it drives back the soul</l>
     <l n="130">To settle on herself , our point supreme ! 130</l>
     <l n="131">There lies our theatre ; there sits our judge .</l>
     <l n="132">Darkness the curtain drops o'er life 's dull scene ;</l>
     <l n="133">‘ Tis the kind hand of Providence stretch 'd out</l>
     <l n="134">‘ Twixt man and vanity ; ‘ tis reason 's reign ,</l>
     <l n="135">And virtue 's too ; these tutelary shades</l>
     <l n="136">Are man 's asylum from the tainted throng .</l>
     <l n="137">Night is the good man 's friend , and guardian too ;</l>
     <l n="138">It no less rescues virtue , than inspires .</l>
     <l n="139">Virtue , for ever frail , as fair , below ,</l>
     <l n="140">Her tender nature suffers in the crowd , 140</l>
     <l n="141">Nor touches on the world , without a stain :</l>
     <l n="142">The world 's infectious ; few bring back at eve .</l>
     <l n="143">Immaculate , the manners of the morn .</l>
     <l n="144">Something we thought , is blotted ; we resolved ,</l>
     <l n="145">Is shaken ; we renounced , returns again .</l>

     <l n="437">On wing impetuous , a black sullen soul ,</l>
     <l n="438">Blasted from hell , with horrid lust of death ;</l>
     <l n="439">Thy friend , the brave , the gallant Altamont ,</l>
     <l n="440">So call 'd , so thought — and then he fled the field . 440</l>
     <l n="441">Less base the fear of death , than fear of life .</l>
     <l n="442">O Britain , infamous for suicide !</l>
     <l n="443">An island in thy manners ! far disjoin 'd</l>
     <l n="444">From the whole world of rationals beside !</l>
     <l n="445">In ambient waves plunge thy polluted head ,</l>
     <l n="446">Wash the dire stain , nor shock the Continent .</l>
     <l n="447">But thou be shock 'd , while I detect the cause</l>
     <l n="448">Of self-assault , expose the monster 's birth ,</l>
     <l n="449">And bid abhorrence hiss it round the world .</l>
     <l n="450">Blame not thy clime , nor chide the distant sun ; 450</l>
     <l n="451">The sun is innocent , thy clime absolved :</l>
     <l n="452">Immoral climes kind nature never made .</l>
     <l n="453">The cause I sing , in Eden might prevail ,</l>
     <l n="454">And proves , it is thy folly , not thy fate .</l>
     <l n="455">The soul of man ( let man in homage bow ,</l>
     <l n="456">Who names his soul ) , a native of the skies !</l>
     <l n="457">High-born , and free , her freedom should maintain ,</l>
     <l n="458">Unsold , unmortgaged for earth 's little bribes .</l>
     <l n="459">Th ’ illustrious stranger , in this foreign land , 459</l>
     <l n="460">Like strangers , jealous of her dignity ,</l>
     <l n="461">Studious of home , and ardent to return ,</l>
     <l n="462">Of earth suspicious , earth 's enchanted cup</l>
     <l n="463">With cool reserve light touching , should indulge</l>
     <l n="464">On immortality her godlike taste ;</l>
     <l n="465">There take large draughts , make her chief banquet there .</l>
     <l n="466">But some reject this sustenance divine ;</l>
     <l n="467">To beggarly vile appetites descend ;</l>
     <l n="468">Ask alms of earth , for guests that came from heaven !</l>
     <l n="469">Sink into slaves ; and sell , for present hire ,</l>
     <l n="470">Their rich reversion , and ( what shares its fate ) 470</l>
     <l n="471">Their native freedom , to the prince who sways</l>
     <l n="472">This nether world . And when his payments fail ,</l>
     <l n="473">When his foul basket gorges them no more ,</l>
     <l n="474">Or their pall 'd palates loathe the basket full ;</l>
     <l n="475">Are instantly , with wild demoniac rage ,</l>
     <l n="476">For breaking all the chains of Providence ,</l>
     <l n="477">And bursting their confinement ; though fast barr 'd</l>
     <l n="478">By laws divine and human ; guarded strong</l>
     <l n="479">With horrors doubled to defend the pass ,</l>
     <l n="480">The blackest , nature , or dire guilt , can raise ; 480</l>
     <l n="481">And moated round with fathomless destruction ,</l>
     <l n="482">Sure to receive , and whelm them in their fall .</l>
     <l n="483">Such , Britons ! is the cause , to you unknown ,</l>
     <l n="484">Or worse , o'erlook ' d ; o'erlook ' d by magistrates ,</l>
     <l n="485">Thus criminals themselves . I grant the deed</l>
     <l n="486">Is madness , but the madness of the heart .</l>
     <l n="487">And what is that ? Our utmost bound of guilt .</l>
     <l n="488">A sensual , unreflecting life , is big</l>
     <l n="489">With monstrous births , and suicide , to crown</l>
     <l n="490">The black infernal brood . The bold to break 490</l>
     <l n="491">Heaven 's law supreme , and desperately rush ,</l>
     <l n="492">Through sacred Nature 's murder , on their own ,</l>
     <l n="493">Because they never think of death , they die . 493</l>
     <l n="494">‘ Tis equally man 's duty , glory , gain ,</l>
     <l n="495">At once to shun , and meditate , his end .</l>
     <l n="496">When by the bed of languishment we sit</l>
     <l n="497">( The seat of wisdom ! if our choice , not fate ) ,</l>
     <l n="498">Or , o'er our dying friends , in anguish hang ,</l>
     <l n="499">Wipe the cold dew , or stay the sinking head ,</l>
     <l n="500">Number their moments , and , in every clock , 500</l>
     <l n="501">Start at the voice of an eternity ;</l>
     <l n="502">See the dim lamp of life just feebly lift</l>
     <l n="503">An agonizing beam , at us to gaze ,</l>
     <l n="504">Then sink again , and quiver into death ,</l>
     <l n="505">That most pathetic herald of our own ;</l>
     <l n="506">How read we such sad scenes ? As sent to man</l>
     <l n="507">In perfect vengeance ? No ; in pity sent ,</l>
     <l n="508">To melt him down , like wax , and then impress ,</l>
     <l n="509">Indelible , Death 's image on his heart ;</l>
     <l n="510">Bleeding for others , trembling for himself . 510</l>
     <l n="511">We bleed , we tremble , we forget , we smile .</l>
     <l n="512">The mind turns fool , before the cheek is dry .</l>
     <l n="513">Our quick-returning folly cancels all ;</l>
     <l n="514">As the tide rushing razes what is writ</l>
     <l n="515">In yielding sands , and smooths the letter 'd shore .</l>
     <l n="516">Lorenzo ! hast thou ever weigh 'd a sigh ?</l>
     <l n="517">Or studied the philosophy of tears ?</l>
     <l n="518">( A science , yet unlectured in our schools ! )</l>
     <l n="519">Hast thou descended deep into the breast ,</l>
     <l n="520">And seen their source ? If not , descend with me , 520</l>
     <l n="521">And trace these briny rivulets to their springs .</l>
     <l n="522">Our funeral tears from different causes rise ,</l>
     <l n="523">As if from separate cisterns in the soul ,</l>
     <l n="524">Of various kinds , they flow . From tender hearts ,</l>
     <l n="525">By soft contagion call 'd , some burst at once ,</l>
     <l n="526">And stream obsequious to the leading eye .</l>
     <l n="527">Some ask more time , by curious art distill 'd . 527</l>
     <l n="528">Some hearts , in secret hard , unapt to melt ,</l>
     <l n="529">Struck by the magic of the public eye ,</l>
     <l n="530">Like Moses ’ smitten rock , gush out amain .</l>
     <l n="531">Some weep to share the fame of the deceased ,</l>
     <l n="532">So high in merit , and to them so dear .</l>
     <l n="533">They dwell on praises , which they think they share ; 533</l>
     <l n="534">And thus , without a blush , commend themselves .</l>
     <l n="535">Some mourn , in proof that something they could love :</l>
     <l n="536">They weep not to relieve their grief , but show .</l>
     <l n="537">Some weep in perfect justice to the dead ,</l>
     <l n="538">As conscious all their love is in arrear .</l>
     <l n="539">Some mischievously weep , not unapprised</l>
     <l n="540">Tears , sometimes , aid the conquest of an eye . 540</l>
     <l n="541">With what address the soft Ephesians draw</l>
     <l n="542">Their sable network o'er entangled hearts !</l>
     <l n="543">As seen through crystal , how their roses glow ,</l>
     <l n="544">While liquid pearl runs trickling down their cheek !</l>
     <l n="545">Of hers not prouder Egypt 's wanton queen ,</l>
     <l n="546">Carousing gems , herself dissolved in love .</l>
     <l n="547">Some weep at death , abstracted from the dead ,</l>
     <l n="548">And celebrate , like Charles ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 22 ]</span>their own decease .</l>
     <l n="549">By kind construction some are deem 'd to weep ,</l>
     <l n="550">Because a decent veil conceals their joy . 550</l>
     <l n="551">Some weep in earnest , and yet weep in vain ;</l>
     <l n="552">As deep in indiscretion , as in woe .</l>
     <l n="553">Passion , blind Passion ! impotently pours</l>
     <l n="554">Tears , that deserve more tears ; while Reason sleeps ;</l>
     <l n="555">Or gazes like an idiot , unconcern 'd ;</l>
     <l n="556">Nor comprehends the meaning of the storm ;</l>
     <l n="557">Knows not it speaks to her , and her alone .</l>
     <l n="558">Irrationals all sorrow are beneath ,</l>
     <l n="559">That noble gift ! that privilege of man !</l>
     <l n="560">From sorrow 's pang , the birth of endless joy . 560</l>
     <l n="561">But these are barren of that birth divine :</l>
     <l n="562">They weep impetuous , as the summer storm ,</l>
     <l n="563">And full as short ! The cruel grief soon tamed ,</l>
     <l n="564">They make a pastime of the stingless tale ;</l>
     <l n="565">Far as the deep resounding knell , they spread</l>
     <l n="566">The dreadful news , and hardly feel it more .</l>
     <l n="567">No grain of wisdom pays them for their woe .</l>
     <l n="568">Half-round the globe , the tears pump 'd up by Death</l>
     <l n="569">Are spent in watering vanities of life ;</l>
     <l n="570">In making folly flourish still more fair , 570</l>
     <l n="571">When the sick soul , her wonted stay withdrawn ,</l>
     <l n="572">Reclines on earth , and sorrows in the dust ;</l>
     <l n="573">Instead of learning , there , her true support ,</l>
     <l n="574">Though there thrown down her true support to learn .</l>
     <l n="575">Without Heaven 's aid , impatient to be bless 'd ,</l>
     <l n="576">She crawls to the next shrub , or bramble vile ,</l>
     <l n="577">Though from the stately cedar 's arms she fell ;</l>
     <l n="578">With stale , forsworn embraces , clings anew ,</l>
     <l n="579">The stranger weds , and blossoms , as before ,</l>
     <l n="580">In all the fruitless fopperies of life : 580</l>
     <l n="581">Presents her weed , well-fancied , at the ball ,</l>
     <l n="582">And raffles for the Death'shYpppHeNhead on the ring .</l>
     <l n="583">So wept Aurelia , till the destined youth</l>
     <l n="584">Stepp 'd in , with his receipt for making smiles ,</l>
     <l n="585">And blanching sables into bridal bloom .</l>
     <l n="586">So wept Lorenzo fair Clarissa 's fate ;</l>
     <l n="587">Who gave that angel boy , on whom he doats ;</l>
     <l n="588">And died to give him , orphan 'd in his birth !</l>
     <l n="589">Not such , Narcissa , my distress for thee .</l>
     <l n="590">I 'll make an altar of thy sacred tomb , 590</l>
     <l n="591">To sacrifice to wisdom .— What wast thou ?</l>
     <l n="592">“ Young , gay , and fortunate ! ” Each yields a theme .</l>
     <l n="593">I 'll dwell on each , to shun thought more severe ;</l>
     <l n="594">( Heaven knows I labour with severer still ! ) 594</l>
     <l n="595">I 'll dwell on each , and quite exhaust thy death .</l>
     <l n="596">A soul without reflection , like a pile</l>
     <l n="597">Without inhabitant , to ruin runs .</l>
     <l n="598">And , first , thy youth . What says it to grey hairs ?</l>
     <l n="599">Narcissa , I 'm become thy pupil now —</l>
     <l n="600">Early , bright , transient , chaste , as morning dew ,</l>
     <l n="601">She sparkled , was exhaled , and went to heaven .</l>
     <l n="602">Time on this head has snow 'd ; yet still ‘ tis borne 602</l>
     <l n="603">Aloft ; nor thinks but on another 's grave .</l>
     <l n="604">Cover 'd with shame I speak it , age severe</l>
     <l n="605">Old worn-out vice sets down for virtue fair ;</l>
     <l n="606">With graceless gravity , chastising youth ,</l>
     <l n="607">That youth chastised surpassing in a fault ,</l>
     <l n="608">Father of all , forgetfulness of death :</l>
     <l n="609">As if , like objects pressing on the sight ,</l>
     <l n="610">Death had advanced too near us to be seen : 610</l>
     <l n="611">Or , that life 's loan Time ripen 'd into right ;</l>
     <l n="612">And men might plead prescription from the grave ;</l>
     <l n="613">Deathless , from repetition of reprieve .</l>
     <l n="614">Deathless ? far from it ! such are dead already ;</l>
     <l n="615">Their hearts are buried , and the world their grave .</l>
     <l n="616">Tell me , some god ! my guardian angel ! tell ,</l>
     <l n="617">What thus infatuates ? what enchantment plants</l>
     <l n="618">The phantom of an age ‘ twixt us , and Death</l>
     <l n="619">Already at the door ? He knocks , we hear ,</l>
     <l n="620">And yet we will not hear . What mail defends 620</l>
     <l n="621">Our untouch 'd hearts ? what miracle turns off</l>
     <l n="622">The pointed thought , which from a thousand quivers</l>
     <l n="623">Is daily darted , and is daily shunn 'd ?</l>
     <l n="624">We stand , as in a battle , throngs on throngs</l>
     <l n="625">Around us falling ; wounded oft ourselves ;</l>
     <l n="626">Though bleeding with our wounds , immortal still !</l>
     <l n="627">We see Time 's furrows on another 's brow ,</l>
     <l n="628">And Death intrench 'd , preparing his assault ; 628</l>
     <l n="629">How few themselves , in that just mirror , see ,</l>
     <l n="630">Or , seeing , draw their inference as strong !</l>
     <l n="631">There , death is certain ; doubtful here : he must ,</l>
     <l n="632">And soon ; we may , within an age , expire .</l>
     <l n="633">Though grey our heads , our thoughts and aims are green ;</l>
     <l n="634">Like damaged clocks , whose hand and bell dissent ;</l>
     <l n="635">Folly sings six , while Nature points at twelve .</l>
     <l n="636">Absurd longevity ! More , more ! it cries :</l>
     <l n="637">More life , more wealth , more trash of every kind .</l>
     <l n="638">And wherefore mad for more , when relish fails ?</l>
     <l n="639">Object , and appetite , must club for joy ;</l>
     <l n="640">Shall Folly labour hard to mend the bow , 640</l>
     <l n="641">Baubles , I mean , that strike us from without ,</l>
     <l n="642">While Nature is relaxing every string ?</l>
     <l n="643">Ask thought for joy ; grow rich , and hoard within .</l>
     <l n="644">Think you the soul , when this life 's rattles cease ,</l>
     <l n="645">Has nothing of more manly to succeed ?</l>
     <l n="646">Contract the taste immortal ; learn even now</l>
     <l n="647">To relish what alone subsists hereafter .</l>
     <l n="648">Divine , or none , henceforth your joys for ever .</l>
     <l n="649">Of age the glory is , to wish to die .</l>
     <l n="650">That wish is praise , and promise ; it applauds 650</l>
     <l n="651">Past life , and promises our future bliss .</l>
     <l n="652">What weakness see not children in their sires ?</l>
     <l n="653">Grand-climacterical absurdities !</l>
     <l n="654">Grey-hair 'd authority , to faults of youth ,</l>
     <l n="655">How shocking ! it makes folly thrice a fool ;</l>
     <l n="656">And our first childhood might our last despise .</l>
     <l n="657">Peace and esteem is all that age can hope .</l>
     <l n="658">Nothing but wisdom gives the first ; the last ,</l>
     <l n="659">Nothing , but the repute of being wise .</l>
     <l n="660">Folly bars both ; our age is quite undone . 660</l>
     <l n="661">What folly can be ranker ? Like our shadows ,</l>
     <l n="662">Our wishes lengthen , as our sun declines . 662</l>
     <l n="663">No wish should loiter , then , this side the grave .</l>
     <l n="664">Our hearts should leave the world , before the knell</l>
     <l n="665">Calls for our carcases to mend the soil .</l>
     <l n="666">Enough to live in tempest , die in port ;</l>
     <l n="667">Age should fly concourse , cover in retreat</l>
     <l n="668">Defects of judgment ; and the will subdue ;</l>
     <l n="669">Walk thoughtful on the silent , solemn shore</l>
     <l n="670">Of that vast ocean it must sail so soon ; 670</l>
     <l n="671">And put good works on board ; and wait the wind</l>
     <l n="672">That shortly blows us into worlds unknown :</l>
     <l n="673">If unconsider 'd too , a dreadful scene !</l>
     <l n="674">All should be prophets to themselves ; foresee</l>
     <l n="675">Their future fate ; their future fate foretaste ;</l>
     <l n="676">This art would waste the bitterness of death .</l>
     <l n="677">The thought of death alone , the fear destroys .</l>
     <l n="678">A disaffection to that precious thought</l>
     <l n="679">Is more than midnight darkness on the soul ,</l>
     <l n="680">Which sleeps beneath it , on a precipice , 680</l>
     <l n="681">Puff 'd off by the first blast , and lost for ever .</l>
     <l n="682">Dost ask , Lorenzo , why so warmly press 'd ,</l>
     <l n="683">By repetition hammer 'd on thine ear ,</l>
     <l n="684">The thought of death ? That thought is the machine ,</l>
     <l n="685">The grand machine , that heaves us from the dust ,</l>
     <l n="686">And rears us into men . That thought , plied home ,</l>
     <l n="687">Will soon reduce the ghastly precipice</l>
     <l n="688">O'erhYpppHeNhanging hell , will soften the descent ,</l>
     <l n="689">And gently slope our passage to the grave ;</l>
     <l n="690">How warmly to be wish 'd ! What heart of flesh 690</l>
     <l n="691">Would trifle with tremendous ? dare extremes ?</l>
     <l n="692">Yawn o'er the fate of infinite ? What hand ,</l>
     <l n="693">Beyond the blackest brand of censure bold ,</l>
     <l n="694">( To speak a language too well known to thee ) ,</l>
     <l n="695">Would at a moment give its all to chance , 695</l>
     <l n="696">And stamp the die for an eternity ?</l>
     <l n="697">Aid me , Narcissa ! aid me to keep pace</l>
     <l n="698">With Destiny ; and ere her scissors cut</l>
     <l n="699">My thread of life , to break this tougher thread</l>
     <l n="700">Of moral death , that ties me to the world .</l>
     <l n="701">Sting thou my slumbering reason to send forth</l>
     <l n="702">A thought of observation on the foe ; 702</l>
     <l n="703">To sally ; and survey the rapid march</l>
     <l n="704">Of his ten thousand messengers to man ;</l>
     <l n="705">Who , Jehu-like , behind him turns them all .</l>
     <l n="706">All accident apart , by Nature sign 'd ,</l>
     <l n="707">My warrant is gone out , though dormant yet ;</l>
     <l n="708">Perhaps behind one moment lurks my fate .</l>
     <l n="709">Must I then forward only look for Death ?</l>
     <l n="710">Backward I turn mine eye , and find him there . 710</l>
     <l n="711">Man is a self-survivor every year .</l>
     <l n="712">Man , like a stream , is in perpetual flow .</l>
     <l n="713">Death 's a destroyer of quotidian<span type="note_anchor">[ 23 ]</span>prey .</l>
     <l n="714">My youth , my noontide , his ; my yesterday ;</l>
     <l n="715">The bold invader shares the present hour .</l>
     <l n="716">Each moment on the former shuts the grave .</l>
     <l n="717">While man is growing , life is in decrease ;</l>

     <l n="719">Our birth is nothing but our death begun ;</l>
     <l n="720">As tapers waste , that instant they take fire . 720</l>
     <l n="721">Shall we then fear , lest that should come to pass ,</l>
     <l n="722">Which comes to pass each moment of our lives ?</l>
     <l n="723">If fear we must , let that Death turn us pale ,</l>
     <l n="724">Which murders strength and ardour ; what remains</l>
     <l n="725">Should rather call on Death , than dread his call .</l>

     <l n="729">And with its thunder scarce obtains your ear ! 729</l>

     <l n="731">Nor longer want , ye monumental sires !</l>
     <l n="732">A brother tomb to tell you ye shall die .</l>
     <l n="733">That death you dread ( so great is Nature 's skill )</l>
     <l n="734">Know , you shall court before you shall enjoy .</l>
     <l n="735">But you are learn 'd ; in volumes deep , you sit ;</l>

     <l n="737">Would you be still more learned than the learn 'd ?</l>
     <l n="738">Learn well to know how much need not be known ,</l>

     <l n="740">Our needful knowledge , like our needful food , 740</l>
     <l n="741">Unhedged , lies open in life 's common field ;</l>

     <l n="743">You scorn what lies before you in the page</l>
     <l n="744">Of Nature , and Experience , moral truth ;</l>
     <l n="745">Of indispensable , eternal fruit ;</l>
     <l n="746">Fruit , on which mortals feeding , turn to gods :</l>
     <l n="747">And dive in science for distinguish 'd names ,</l>
     <l n="748">Dishonest fomentation of your pride !</l>
     <l n="749">Sinking in virtue , as you rise in fame .</l>
     <l n="750">Your learning , like the lunar beam , affords 750</l>

     <l n="755">If you would learn Death 's character , attend .</l>
     <l n="756">All casts of conduct , all degrees of health ,</l>
     <l n="757">All dies of fortune , and all dates of age ,</l>
     <l n="758">Together shook in his impartial urn ,</l>
     <l n="759">Come forth at random : or , if choice is made ,</l>
     <l n="760">The choice is quite sarcastic , and insults 760</l>
     <l n="761">All bold conjecture , and fond hopes of man .</l>
     <l n="762">What countless multitudes not only leave ,</l>
     <l n="763">But deeply disappoint us , by their deaths ! 763</l>
     <l n="764">Though great our sorrow , greater our surprise .</l>
     <l n="765">Like other tyrants , Death delights to smite ,</l>
     <l n="766">What , smitten , most proclaims the pride of power ,</l>
     <l n="767">And arbitrary nod . His joy supreme ,</l>
     <l n="768">To bid the wretch survive the fortunate ;</l>
     <l n="769">The feeble wrap th ’ athletic in his shroud ;</l>
     <l n="770">And weeping fathers build their children 's tomb : 770</l>
     <l n="771">Me thine , Narcissa !— What though short thy date ?</l>
     <l n="772">Virtue , not rolling suns , the mind matures .</l>
     <l n="773">That life is long , which answers life 's great end .</l>
     <l n="774">The time that bears no fruit , deserves no name ;</l>

     <l n="777">O how misdated on their flattering tombs !</l>
     <l n="778">Narcissa 's youth has lectured me thus far .</l>
     <l n="779">And can her gaiety give counsel too ?</l>
     <l n="780">That , like the Jews ’ famed oracle of gems ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 24 ]</span>780</l>
     <l n="781">Sparkles instruction ; such as throws new light ,</l>
     <l n="782">And opens more the character of Death ;</l>
     <l n="783">Ill known to thee , Lorenzo ! This thy vaunt :</l>
     <l n="784">“ Give Death his due , the wretched , and the old ;</l>
     <l n="785">Even let him sweep his rubbish to the grave ;</l>
     <l n="786">Let him not violate kind Nature 's laws ,</l>
     <l n="787">But own man born to live as well as die . ”</l>
     <l n="788">Wretched and old thou givest him ; young and gay</l>
     <l n="789">He takes ; and plunder is a tyrant 's joy .</l>
     <l n="790">What if I prove , “ The farthest from the fear , 790</l>
     <l n="791">Are often nearest to the stroke of Fate ? ”</l>
     <l n="792">All , more than common , menaces an end .</l>
     <l n="793">A blaze betokens brevity of life :</l>
     <l n="794">As if bright embers should emit a flame ,</l>
     <l n="795">Glad spirits sparkled from Narcissa 's eye ,</l>
     <l n="796">And made youth younger , and taught life to live , 796</l>
     <l n="797">As Nature 's opposites wage endless war ,</l>
     <l n="798">For this offence , as treason to the deep</l>
     <l n="799">Inviolable stupor of his reign ,</l>
     <l n="800">Where Lust , and turbulent Ambition , sleep ,</l>
     <l n="801">Death took swift vengeance . As he life detests ,</l>
     <l n="802">More life is still more odious ; and , reduced</l>
     <l n="803">By conquest , aggrandizes more his power . 803</l>
     <l n="804">But wherefore aggrandized ? By Heaven 's decree ,</l>
     <l n="805">To plant the soul on her eternal guard ,</l>
     <l n="806">In awful expectation of our end .</l>
     <l n="807">Thus runs Death 's dread commission : “ Strike , but so</l>
     <l n="808">As most alarms the living by the dead . ”</l>
     <l n="809">Hence stratagem delights him , and surprise ,</l>
     <l n="810">And cruel sport with man 's securities . 810</l>
     <l n="811">Not simple conquest , triumph is his aim ;</l>
     <l n="812">And , where least fear 'd , there conquest triumphs most .</l>
     <l n="813">This proves my bold assertion not too bold .</l>
     <l n="814">What are his arts to lay our fears asleep ?</l>
     <l n="815">Tiberian arts his purposes wrap up</l>
     <l n="816">In deep dissimulation 's darkest night .</l>
     <l n="817">Like princes unconfess 'd in foreign courts ,</l>
     <l n="818">Who travel under cover , Death assumes</l>
     <l n="819">The name and look of life , and dwells among us .</l>
     <l n="820">He takes all shapes that serve his black designs : 820</l>
     <l n="821">Though master of a wider empire far</l>
     <l n="822">Than that o'er which the Roman eagle flew .</l>
     <l n="823">Like Nero , he 's a fiddler , charioteer ,</l>
     <l n="824">Or drives his phaeton , in female guise ;</l>
     <l n="825">Quite unsuspected , till , the wheel beneath ,</l>
     <l n="826">His disarray 'd oblation he devours .</l>
     <l n="827">He most affects the forms least like himself ,</l>
     <l n="828">His slender self . Hence burly corpulence</l>
     <l n="829">Is his familiar wear , and sleek disguise .</l>
     <l n="830">Behind the rosy bloom he loves to lurk , 830</l>
     <l n="831">Or ambush in a smile ; or wanton dive</l>
     <l n="832">In dimples deep ; love 's eddies , which draw in</l>
     <l n="833">Unwary hearts , and sink them in despair .</l>
     <l n="834">Such , on Narcissa 's couch he loiter 'd long</l>
     <l n="835">Unknown ; and , when detected , still was seen</l>
     <l n="836">To smile ; such peace has innocence in death !</l>
     <l n="837">Most happy they ! whom least his arts deceive .</l>
     <l n="838">One eye on Death , and one full fix 'd on heaven ,</l>
     <l n="839">Becomes a mortal , and immortal man .</l>
     <l n="840">Long on his wiles a piqued and jealous spy , 840</l>
     <l n="841">I 've seen , or dreamt I saw , the tyrant dress ;</l>
     <l n="842">Lay by his horrors , and put on his smiles .</l>
     <l n="843">Say , Muse , for thou remember'st , call it back ,</l>
     <l n="844">And show Lorenzo the surprising scene ;</l>
     <l n="845">If ‘ twas a dream , his genius can explain .</l>
     <l n="846">‘ Twas in a circle of the gay I stood .</l>
     <l n="847">Death would have enter 'd ; Nature push 'd him back ;</l>
     <l n="848">Supported by a doctor of renown ,</l>
     <l n="849">His point he gain 'd . Then artfully dismiss 'd</l>
     <l n="850">The sage ; for Death design 'd to be conceal 'd . 850</l>
     <l n="851">He gave an old vivacious usurer</l>
     <l n="852">His meagre aspect , and his naked bones ;</l>
     <l n="853">In gratitude for plumping up his prey ,</l>
     <l n="854">A pamper 'd spendthrift ; whose fantastic air ,</l>
     <l n="855">Well-fashion 'd figure , and cockaded<span type="note_anchor">[ 25 ]</span>brow ,</l>
     <l n="856">He took in change , and underneath the pride</l>
     <l n="857">Of costly linen , tuck 'd his filthy shroud .</l>
     <l n="858">His crooked bow he straighten 'd to a cane ;</l>
     <l n="859">And hid his deadly shafts in Myra 's eye .</l>
     <l n="860">The dreadful masquerader , thus equipp 'd , 860</l>
     <l n="861">Out sallies on adventures . Ask you where ?</l>
     <l n="862">Where is he not ? For his peculiar haunts ,</l>
     <l n="863">Let this suffice ; sure as night follows day ,</l>
     <l n="864">Death treads in pleasure 's footsteps round the world , 864</l>
     <l n="865">When pleasure treads the paths , which reason shuns .</l>
     <l n="866">When , against reason , riot shuts the door ,</l>
     <l n="867">And gaiety supplies the place of sense ,</l>
     <l n="868">Then , foremost at the banquet , and the ball ,</l>
     <l n="869">Death leads the dance , or stamps the deadly die ;</l>
     <l n="870">Nor ever fails the midnight bowl to crown . 870</l>
     <l n="871">Gaily carousing to his gay compeers ,</l>
     <l n="872">Inly he laughs , to see them laugh at him ,</l>
     <l n="873">As absent far : and when the revel burns ,</l>
     <l n="874">When fear is banish 'd , and triumphant thought ,</l>
     <l n="875">Calling for all the joys beneath the moon ,</l>
     <l n="876">Against him turns the key ; and bids him sup</l>
     <l n="877">With their progenitors — He drops his mask ;</l>
     <l n="878">Frowns out at full ; they start , despair , expire .</l>
     <l n="879">Scarce with more sudden terror and surprise ,</l>
     <l n="880">From his black mask of nitre , touch 'd by fire , 880</l>
     <l n="881">He bursts , expands , roars , blazes , and devours .</l>
     <l n="882">And is not this triumphant treachery ,</l>
     <l n="883">And more than simple conquest , in the fiend ?</l>
     <l n="884">And now , Lorenzo , dost thou wrap thy soul</l>
     <l n="885">In soft security , because unknown</l>
     <l n="886">Which moment is commission 'd to destroy ?</l>
     <l n="887">In death 's uncertainty thy danger lies .</l>
     <l n="888">Is death uncertain ? Therefore thou be fix 'd ;</l>
     <l n="889">Fix 'd as a sentinel , all eye , all ear ,</l>
     <l n="890">All expectation of the coming foe . 890</l>
     <l n="891">Rouse , stand in arms , nor lean against thy spear ;</l>
     <l n="892">Lest slumber steal one moment o'er thy soul ,</l>
     <l n="893">And Fate surprise thee nodding . Watch , be strong :</l>
     <l n="894">Thus give each day the merit , and renown ,</l>
     <l n="895">Of dying well ; though doom 'd but once to die .</l>
     <l n="896">Nor let life 's period hidden ( as from most )</l>
     <l n="897">Hide too from thee the precious use of life .</l>
     <l n="898">Early , not sudden , was Narcissa 's fate . 898</l>
     <l n="899">Soon , not surprising , Death his visit paid .</l>
     <l n="900">Her thought went forth to meet him on his way ,</l>
     <l n="901">Nor gaiety forgot it was to die :</l>
     <l n="902">Though Fortune too ( our third and final theme ) ,</l>
     <l n="903">As an accomplice , play 'd her gaudy plumes ,</l>
     <l n="904">And every glittering gewgaw , on her sight , 904</l>
     <l n="905">To dazzle , and debauch it from its mark .</l>
     <l n="906">Death 's dreadful advent is the mark of man ;</l>
     <l n="907">And every thought that misses it , is blind .</l>
     <l n="908">Fortune , with youth and gaiety , conspired</l>
     <l n="909">To weave a triple wreath of happiness</l>
     <l n="910">( If happiness on earth ) to crown her brow . 910</l>
     <l n="911">And could Death charge through such a shining shield ?</l>
     <l n="912">That shining shield invites the tyrant 's spear .</l>
     <l n="913">As if to damp our elevated aims ,</l>
     <l n="914">And strongly preach humility to man .</l>
     <l n="915">O how portentous is prosperity !</l>
     <l n="916">How , comet-like , it threatens , while it shines !</l>
     <l n="917">Few years but yield us proof of Death 's ambition ,</l>
     <l n="918">To cull his victims from the fairest fold ,</l>
     <l n="919">And sheath his shafts in all the pride of life .</l>
     <l n="920">When flooded with abundance , purpled o'er 920</l>
     <l n="921">With recent honours , bloom 'd with every bliss ,</l>
     <l n="922">Set up in ostentation , made the gaze ,</l>
     <l n="923">The gaudy centre , of the public eye ,</l>
     <l n="924">When Fortune thus has toss 'd her child in air ,</l>
     <l n="925">Snatch 'd from the covert of an humble state ,</l>
     <l n="926">How often have I seen him dropp 'd at once ,</l>
     <l n="927">Our morning 's envy ! and our evening 's sigh !</l>
     <l n="928">As if her bounties were the signal given ,</l>
     <l n="929">The flowery wreath to mark the sacrifice ,</l>
     <l n="930">And call Death 's arrows on the destined prey . 930</l>
     <l n="931">High Fortune seems in cruel league with Fate .</l>
     <l n="932">Ask you for what ? To give his war on man 932</l>
     <l n="933">The deeper dread , and more illustrious spoil ;</l>
     <l n="934">Thus to keep daring mortals more in awe .</l>
     <l n="935">And burns Lorenzo still for the sublime</l>
     <l n="936">Of life ? to hang his airy nest on high ,</l>
     <l n="937">On the slight timber of the topmost bough ,</l>
     <l n="938">Rock 'd at each breeze , and menacing a fall ?</l>
     <l n="939">Granting grim Death at equal distance there ;</l>
     <l n="940">Yet peace begins just where ambition ends . 940</l>
     <l n="941">What makes man wretched ? Happiness denied ?</l>
     <l n="942">Lorenzo ! no : ‘ tis happiness disdain 'd .</l>
     <l n="943">She comes too meanly dress 'd to win our smile ;</l>
     <l n="944">And calls herself Content , a homely name !</l>
     <l n="945">Our flame is transport , and Content our scorn .</l>
     <l n="946">Ambition turns , and shuts the door against her ,</l>
     <l n="947">And weds a toil , a tempest , in her stead ;</l>
     <l n="948">A tempest to warm transport near of kin .</l>
     <l n="949">Unknowing what our mortal state admits ,</l>
     <l n="950">Life 's modest joys we ruin , while we raise ; 950</l>
     <l n="951">And all our ecstasies are wounds to peace ;</l>
     <l n="952">Peace , the full portion of mankind below .</l>
     <l n="953">And since thy peace is dear , ambitious youth !</l>
     <l n="954">Of fortune fond ! as thoughtless of thy fate !</l>
     <l n="955">As late I drew Death 's picture , to stir up</l>
     <l n="956">Thy wholesome fears ; now , drawn in contrast , see</l>
     <l n="957">Gay Fortune 's , thy vain hopes to reprimand .</l>
     <l n="958">See , high in air , the sportive goddess hangs ,</l>
     <l n="959">Unlocks her casket , spreads her glittering ware ,</l>
     <l n="960">And calls the giddy winds to puff abroad 960</l>
     <l n="961">Her random bounties o'er the gaping throng .</l>
     <l n="962">All rush rapacious ; friends o'er trodden friends ;</l>
     <l n="963">Sons o'er their fathers , subjects o'er their kings ,</l>
     <l n="964">Priests o'er their gods , and lovers o'er the fair</l>
     <l n="965">( Still more adored ) , to snatch the golden shower .</l>
     <l n="966">Gold glitters most , where virtue shines no more ;</l>
     <l n="967">As stars from absent suns have leave to shine . 967</l>

     <l n="1016">The sun 's defiance , and the flock 's defence ;</l>
     <l n="1017">By the strong strokes of labouring hinds subdued ,</l>
     <l n="1018">Loud groans her last , and , rushing from her height ,</l>
     <l n="1019">In cumbrous ruin , thunders to the ground :</l>
     <l n="1020">The conscious forest trembles at the shock , 1020</l>
     <l n="1021">And hill , and stream , and distant dale , resound .</l>
     <l n="1022">These high-aim 'd darts of Death , and these alone ,</l>
     <l n="1023">Should I collect , my quiver would be full .</l>
     <l n="1024">A quiver , which , suspended in mid-air ,</l>
     <l n="1025">Or near heaven 's archer , in the zodiac , hung ,</l>
     <l n="1026">( So could it be ) should draw the public eye ,</l>
     <l n="1027">The gaze and contemplation of mankind !</l>
     <l n="1028">A constellation awful , yet benign ,</l>
     <l n="1029">To guide the gay through life 's tempestuous wave ;</l>
     <l n="1030">Nor suffer them to strike the common rock , 1030</l>
     <l n="1031">“ From greater danger to grow more secure ,</l>
     <l n="1032">And , wrapt in happiness , forget their fate . ”</l>
     <l n="1033">Lysander , happy past the common lot ,</l>
     <l n="1034">Was warn 'd of danger , but too gay to fear .</l>
     <l n="1035">He woo 'd the fair Aspasia : she was kind :</l>
     <l n="1036">In youth , form , fortune , fame , they both were bless 'd :</l>

     <l n="1039">Fix 'd was the nuptial hour . Her stately dome</l>
     <l n="1040">Rose on the sounding beach . The glittering spires</l>
     <l n="1041">Float in the wave , and break against the shore :</l>
     <l n="1042">So break those glittering shadows , human joys .</l>
     <l n="1043">The faithless morning smiled : he takes his leave , 1043</l>

     <l n="1049">In suffocating sorrows , shares his tomb .</l>
     <l n="1050">Now , round the sumptuous bridal monument , 1050</l>
     <l n="1051">The guilty billows innocently roar ;</l>

   <p>THE INFIDEL RECLAIMED , IN TWO PARTS ; CONTAINING THE NATURE , PROOF , AND IMPORTANCE OF IMMORTALITY .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>PART I .</head>
     <l n="1">WHERE , AMONG OTHER THINGS , GLORY AND RICHES</l>
     <l n="2">ARE PARTICULARLY CONSIDERED .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>TO THE RIGHT HON . HENRY PELHAM , FIRST LORD COMMISSIONER OF THE TREASURY , AND CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER .</p>
   <p>PREFACE .</p>
   <p>Few ages have been deeper in dispute about religion than this . The dispute about religion , and the practice of it , seldom go together . The shorter , therefore , the dispute , the better . I think it may be reduced to this single question , Is man immortal , or is he not ? If he is not , all our disputes are mere amusements , or trials of skill . In this case , truth , reason , religion , which give our discourses such pomp and solemnity , are ( as will be shown ) mere empty sound , without any meaning in them . But if man is immortal , it will behove him to be very serious about eternal consequences ; or , in other words , to be truly religious . And this great fundamental truth , unestablished , or unawakened in the minds of men , is , I conceive , the real source and support of all our infidelity ; how remote soever the particular objections advanced may seem to be from it .</p>
   <p>Sensible appearances affect most men much more than abstract reasonings ; and we daily see bodies drop around us , but the soul is invisible . The power which inclination has over the judgment , is greater than can be well conceived by those that have not had an experience of it ; and of what numbers is it the sad interest that souls should not survive ! The heathen world confessed , that they rather hoped , than firmly believed , immortality ; and how many heathens have we still amongst us ! The sacred page assures us , that life and immortality are brought to light by the Gospel : but by how many is the Gospel rejected or overlooked ? From these considerations , and from my being accidentally privy to the sentiments of some particular persons , I have been long persuaded that most , if not all , our infidels ( whatever name they take , and whatever scheme , for argument 's sake , and to keep themselves in countenance , they patronise ) , are supported in their deplorable error , by some doubt of their immortality , at the bottom . And I am satisfied , that men once thoroughly convinced of their immortality , are not far from being Christians . For it is hard to conceive , that a man fully conscious eternal pain or happiness will certainly be his lot , should not earnestly and impartially inquire after the surest means of escaping the one , and securing the other . And of such an earnest and impartial inquiry I well know the consequence .</p>
   <p>Here , therefore , in proof of this most fundamental truth , some plain arguments are offered ; arguments derived from principles which infidels admit in common with believers ; arguments which appear to me altogether irresistible ; and such as , I am satisfied , will have great weight with all who give themselves the small trouble of looking seriously into their own bosoms , and of observing , with any tolerable degree of attention , what daily passes round about them in the world . If some arguments shall here occur , which others have declined , they are submitted , with all deference , to better judgments in this , of all points the most important . For , as to the being of a God , that is no longer disputed ; but it is undisputed for this reason only , viz ., because , where the least pretence to reason is admitted , it must for ever be indisputable . And of consequence no man can be betrayed into a dispute of that nature by vanity ; which has a principal share in animating our modern combatants against other articles of our belief .</p>

     <l n="3">She<span type="note_anchor">[ 28 ]</span>( for I know not yet her name in heaven ) ,</l>
     <l n="4">Not early , like Narcissa , left the scene ;</l>
     <l n="5">Nor sudden , like Philander . What avail ?</l>
     <l n="6">This seeming mitigation but inflames ;</l>
     <l n="7">This fancied medicine heightens the disease .</l>
     <l n="8">The longer known , the closer still she grew ;</l>
     <l n="9">And gradual parting is a gradual death .</l>
     <l n="10">‘ Tis the grim tyrant 's engine , which extorts ,</l>
     <l n="11">By tardy pressure 's still-increasing weight ,</l>
     <l n="12">From hardest hearts , confession of distress . 10</l>
     <l n="13">Oh , the long , dark approach through years of pain ,</l>
     <l n="14">Death 's gallery ! ( might I dare to call it so )</l>
     <l n="15">With dismal doubt , and sable terror , hung ;</l>
     <l n="16">Sick hope 's pale lamp its only glimmering ray :</l>
     <l n="17">There , fate my melancholy walk ordain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="18">Forbid self-love itself to flatter , there .</l>
     <l n="19">How oft I gazed , prophetically sad !</l>
     <l n="20">How oft I saw her dead , while yet in smiles ! 18</l>
     <l n="21">In smiles she sunk her grief to lessen mine .</l>
     <l n="22">She spoke me comfort , and increased my pain .</l>
     <l n="23">Like powerful armies trenching at a town ,</l>
     <l n="24">By slow , and silent , but resistless sap ,</l>
     <l n="25">In his pale progress gently gaining ground ,</l>
     <l n="26">Death urged his deadly siege ; in spite of art ,</l>
     <l n="27">Of all the balmy blessings nature lends</l>
     <l n="28">To succour frail humanity . Ye stars !</l>
     <l n="29">( Not now first made familiar to my sight )</l>
     <l n="30">And thou , O moon ! bear witness , many a night</l>
     <l n="31">He tore the pillow from beneath my head ,</l>
     <l n="32">Tied down my sore attention to the shock , 30</l>
     <l n="33">By ceaseless depredations on a life</l>
     <l n="34">Dearer than that he left me . Dreadful post</l>
     <l n="35">Of observation ! darker every hour !</l>
     <l n="36">Less dread the day that drove me to the brink ,</l>
     <l n="37">And pointed at eternity below ;</l>
     <l n="38">When my soul shudder 'd at futurity ;</l>
     <l n="39">When , on a moment 's point , th ’ important die</l>
     <l n="40">Of life and death spun doubtful , ere it fell ,</l>
     <l n="41">And turn 'd up life ; my title to more woe .</l>
     <l n="42">But why more woe ? More comfort let it be . 40</l>
     <l n="43">Nothing is dead , but that which wish 'd to die ;</l>
     <l n="44">Nothing is dead , but wretchedness and pain ;</l>
     <l n="45">Nothing is dead , but what encumber 'd , gall 'd ,</l>
     <l n="46">Block 'd up the pass , and barr 'd from real life .</l>
     <l n="47">Where dwells that wish most ardent of the wise ?</l>
     <l n="48">Too dark the sun to see it ; highest stars</l>
     <l n="49">Too low to reach it ; Death , great Death alone ,</l>
     <l n="50">O'er stars and sun , triumphant , lands us there .</l>
     <l n="51">Nor dreadful our transition ; though the mind ,</l>
     <l n="52">An artist at creating self-alarms , 50</l>
     <l n="53">Rich in expedients for inquietude ,</l>
     <l n="54">Is prone to paint it dreadful . Who can take 52</l>
     <l n="55">Death 's portrait true ? The tyrant never sat .</l>
     <l n="56">Our sketch all random strokes , conjecture all ;</l>
     <l n="57">Close shuts the grave , nor tells one single tale .</l>
     <l n="58">Death , and his image rising in the brain ,</l>
     <l n="59">Bear faint resemblance ; never are alike ;</l>
     <l n="60">Fear shakes the pencil ; Fancy loves excess ;</l>
     <l n="61">Dark Ignorance is lavish of her shades :</l>
     <l n="62">And these the formidable picture draw . 60</l>
     <l n="63">But grant the worst ; ‘ tis past ; new prospects rise ;</l>
     <l n="64">And drop a veil eternal o'er her tomb .</l>
     <l n="65">Far other views our contemplation claim ,</l>
     <l n="66">Views that o'erpay the rigours of our life ;</l>
     <l n="67">Views that suspend our agonies in death .</l>
     <l n="68">Wrapt in the thought of immortality ,</l>
     <l n="69">Wrapt in the single , the triumphant thought !</l>
     <l n="70">Long life might lapse , age unperceived come on ;</l>
     <l n="71">And find the soul unsated with her theme .</l>
     <l n="72">Its nature , proof , importance , fire my song . 70</l>
     <l n="73">O that my song could emulate my soul !</l>
     <l n="74">Like her , immortal . No !— the soul disdains</l>
     <l n="75">A mark so mean ; far nobler hope inflames ;</l>
     <l n="76">If endless ages can outweigh an hour ,</l>
     <l n="77">Let not the laurel , but the palm , inspire .</l>
     <l n="78">Thy nature , Immortality ! who knows ?</l>
     <l n="79">And yet who knows it not ? It is but life</l>
     <l n="80">In stronger thread of brighter colour spun ,</l>
     <l n="81">And spun for ever ; dipp 'd by cruel Fate</l>
     <l n="82">In Stygian dye , how black , how brittle here ! 80</l>
     <l n="83">How short our correspondence with the sun !</l>
     <l n="84">And while it lasts , inglorious ! Our best deeds ,</l>
     <l n="85">How wanting in their weight ! our highest joys</l>
     <l n="86">Small cordials to support us in our pain ,</l>
     <l n="87">And give us strength to suffer . But how great</l>
     <l n="88">To mingle interests , converse , amities , 86</l>
     <l n="89">With all the sons of Reason , scatter 'd wide</l>
     <l n="90">Through habitable space , wherever born ,</l>
     <l n="91">Howe'er endow 'd ! to live free citizens</l>
     <l n="92">Of universal nature ! to lay hold</l>
     <l n="93">By more than feeble faith on the Supreme !</l>
     <l n="94">To call heaven 's rich unfathomable mines</l>
     <l n="95">( Mines , which support archangels in their state ) 93</l>
     <l n="96">Our own ! To rise in science , as in bliss ,</l>
     <l n="97">Initiate in the secrets of the skies !</l>
     <l n="98">To read creation ; read its mighty plan</l>
     <l n="99">In the bare bosom of the Deity !</l>
     <l n="100">The plan , and execution , to collate !</l>
     <l n="101">To see , before each glance of piercing thought ,</l>
     <l n="102">All cloud , all shadow , blown remote ; and leave 100</l>
     <l n="103">No mystery — but that of Love Divine ,</l>
     <l n="104">Which lifts us on the seraph 's flaming wing ,</l>
     <l n="105">From earth 's Aceldama , this field of blood ,</l>
     <l n="106">Of inward anguish , and of outward ill ,</l>
     <l n="107">From darkness , and from dust , to such a scene !</l>
     <l n="108">Love 's element ! true joy 's illustrious home !</l>
     <l n="109">From earth 's sad contrast ( now deplored ) more fair !</l>
     <l n="110">What exquisite vicissitude of fate !</l>
     <l n="111">Bless 'd absolution of our blackest hour !</l>
     <l n="112">Lorenzo , these are thoughts that make man Man , 110</l>
     <l n="113">The wise illumine , aggrandize the great .</l>
     <l n="114">How great ( while yet we tread the kindred clod ,</l>
     <l n="115">And every moment fear to sink beneath</l>
     <l n="116">The clod we tread ; soon trodden by our sons ) ;</l>
     <l n="117">How great , in the wild whirl of Time 's pursuits ,</l>
     <l n="118">To stop , and pause , involved in high presage ,</l>
     <l n="119">Through the long vista of a thousand years ,</l>
     <l n="120">To stand contemplating our distant selves ,</l>
     <l n="121">As in a magnifying mirror seen ,</l>
     <l n="122">Enlarged , ennobled , elevate , divine ! 120</l>
     <l n="123">To prophesy our own futurities ;</l>
     <l n="124">To gaze in thought on what all thought transcends !</l>
     <l n="125">To talk , with fellow-candidates , of joys</l>
     <l n="126">As far beyond conception as desert ,</l>
     <l n="127">Ourselves th ’ astonish 'd talkers , and the tale !</l>
     <l n="128">Lorenzo , swells thy bosom at the thought ?</l>
     <l n="129">The swell becomes thee : ‘ tis an honest pride .</l>
     <l n="130">Revere thyself ;— and yet thyself despise .</l>
     <l n="131">His nature no man can o'erhYpppHeNrate ; and none</l>
     <l n="132">Can under-rate his merit . Take good heed , 130</l>
     <l n="133">Nor there be modest , where thou should'st be proud ;</l>
     <l n="134">That almost universal error shun .</l>
     <l n="135">How just our pride , when we behold those heights !</l>
     <l n="136">Not those Ambition paints in air , but those</l>
     <l n="137">Reason points out , and ardent Virtue gains ,</l>
     <l n="138">And angels emulate ; our pride how just !</l>
     <l n="139">When mount we ? when these shackles cast ? when quit</l>
     <l n="140">This cell of the creation ? this small nest ,</l>
     <l n="141">Stuck in a corner of the universe ,</l>
     <l n="142">Wrapt up in fleecy cloud , and fine-spun air ? 140</l>
     <l n="143">Fine-spun to sense ; but gross and feculent</l>
     <l n="144">To souls celestial ; souls ordain 'd to breathe</l>

     <l n="146">Greatly triumphant on Time 's farther shore ,</l>
     <l n="147">Where Virtue reigns , enrich 'd with full arrears ;</l>
     <l n="148">While Pomp imperial begs an alms of peace .</l>
     <l n="149">In empire high , or in proud science deep ,</l>
     <l n="150">Ye born of earth ! on what can you confer ,</l>
     <l n="151">With half the dignity , with half the gain ,</l>
     <l n="152">The gust , the glow of rational delight , 150</l>
     <l n="153">As on this theme , which angels praise and share ?</l>
     <l n="154">Man 's fates and favours are a theme in heaven .</l>
     <l n="155">What wretched repetition cloys us here !</l>
     <l n="156">What periodic potions for the sick ! 154</l>
     <l n="157">Distemper 'd bodies ! and distemper 'd minds !</l>
     <l n="158">In an eternity , what scenes shall strike !</l>
     <l n="159">Adventures thicken ! novelties surprise !</l>
     <l n="160">What webs of wonder shall unravel , there !</l>
     <l n="161">What full day pour on all the paths of heaven ,</l>
     <l n="162">And light th ’ Almighty 's footsteps in the deep !</l>

     <l n="164">Unwind , at once , the labyrinths of fate , 162</l>
     <l n="165">And straighten its inextricable maze !</l>

     <l n="168">There , not the moral world alone unfolds ;</l>
     <l n="169">The world material , lately seen in shades ,</l>

     <l n="173">Its ample sphere , its universal frame ,</l>
     <l n="174">In full dimensions , swells to the survey ;</l>
     <l n="175">And enters , at one glance , the ravish 'd sight .</l>
     <l n="176">From some superior point ( where , who can tell ?</l>
     <l n="177">Suffice it , ‘ tis a point where gods reside )</l>
     <l n="178">How shall the stranger man 's illumined eye ,</l>

     <l n="501">New toils , succeeding toils , an endless train !</l>
     <l n="502">And murders peace , which taught it first to shine . 500</l>
     <l n="503">The poor are half as wretched as the rich ;</l>
     <l n="504">Whose proud and painful privilege it is</l>
     <l n="505">At once , to bear a double load of woe ;</l>
     <l n="506">To feel the stings of envy , and of want ,</l>
     <l n="507">Outrageous want ! both Indies cannot cure .</l>
     <l n="508">A competence is vital to content .</l>
     <l n="509">Much wealth is corpulence , if not disease ;</l>
     <l n="510">Sick , or encumber 'd , is our happiness ,</l>
     <l n="511">A competence is all we can enjoy .</l>
     <l n="512">Oh , be content , where Heaven can give no more ! 510</l>
     <l n="513">More , like a flash of water from a lock ,</l>
     <l n="514">Quickens our spirits ’ movement for an hour ;</l>
     <l n="515">But soon its force is spent , nor rise our joys</l>
     <l n="516">Above our native temper 's common stream .</l>
     <l n="517">Hence disappointment lurks in every prize ,</l>
     <l n="518">As bees in flowers ; and stings us with success .</l>
     <l n="519">The rich man , who denies it , proudly feigns ;</l>
     <l n="520">Nor knows the wise are privy to the lie .</l>
     <l n="521">Much learning shows how little mortals know ;</l>
     <l n="522">Much wealth , how little worldlings can enjoy : 520</l>
     <l n="523">At best , it babies us with endless toys ,</l>
     <l n="524">And keeps us children till we drop to dust .</l>
     <l n="525">As monkeys at a mirror stand amazed ,</l>
     <l n="526">They fail to find what they so plainly see ; 524</l>
     <l n="527">Thus men , in shining riches , see the face</l>
     <l n="528">Of happiness , nor know it is a shade ;</l>
     <l n="529">But gaze , and touch , and peep , and peep again ,</l>
     <l n="530">And wish , and wonder it is absent still .</l>
     <l n="531">How few can rescue opulence from want !</l>
     <l n="532">Who lives to Nature , rarely can be poor ;</l>
     <l n="533">Who lives to Fancy , never can be rich .</l>
     <l n="534">Poor is the man in debt ; the man of gold , 532</l>
     <l n="535">In debt to Fortune , trembles at her power .</l>
     <l n="536">The man of reason smiles at her , and Death .</l>
     <l n="537">Oh ! what a patrimony this ! a being</l>
     <l n="538">Of such inherent strength and majesty ,</l>
     <l n="539">Not worlds possess 'd can raise it ; worlds destroy 'd</l>
     <l n="540">Ca n't injure ; which holds on its glorious course ,</l>
     <l n="541">When thine , O Nature ! ends ; too blest to mourn</l>
     <l n="542">Creation 's obsequies . What treasure , this ! 540</l>
     <l n="543">The monarch is a beggar to the man .</l>
     <l n="544">Immortal ! Ages past , yet nothing gone !</l>
     <l n="545">Morn without eve ! a race without a goal !</l>
     <l n="546">Unshorten 'd by progression infinite !</l>
     <l n="547">Futurity for ever future ! Life</l>
     <l n="548">Beginning still where computation ends !</l>
     <l n="549">‘ Tis the description of a deity !</l>
     <l n="550">‘ Tis the description of the meanest slave :</l>
     <l n="551">The meanest slave dares then Lorenzo scorn ?</l>
     <l n="552">The meanest slave thy sovereign glory shares . 550</l>
     <l n="553">Proud youth ! fastidious of the lower world !</l>
     <l n="554">Man 's lawful pride includes humility ;</l>
     <l n="555">Stoops to the lowest ; is too great to find</l>
     <l n="556">Inferiors ; all immortal ! brothers all !</l>
     <l n="557">Proprietors eternal of thy love .</l>
     <l n="558">Immortal ! What can strike the sense so strong ,</l>
     <l n="559">As this the soul ? It thunders to the thought ;</l>
     <l n="560">Reason amazes ; gratitude o'erwhelms ; 558</l>
     <l n="561">No more we slumber on the brink of fate ;</l>
     <l n="562">Roused at the sound , th ’ exulting soul ascends ,</l>
     <l n="563">And breathes her native air ; an air that feeds</l>
     <l n="564">Ambitions high , and fans ethereal fires ;</l>
     <l n="565">Quick kindles all that is divine within us ;</l>
     <l n="566">Nor leaves one loitering thought beneath the stars .</l>
     <l n="567">Has not Lorenzo 's bosom caught the flame ?</l>
     <l n="568">Immortal ! Were but one immortal , how</l>
     <l n="569">Would others envy ! how would thrones adore !</l>
     <l n="570">Because ‘ tis common , is the blessing lost ?</l>
     <l n="571">How this ties up the bounteous hand of Heaven ! 569</l>
     <l n="572">Oh , vain , vain , vain , all else ! Eternity !</l>
     <l n="573">A glorious and a needful refuge , that ,</l>
     <l n="574">From vile imprisonment , in abject views .</l>
     <l n="575">‘ Tis immortality , ‘ tis that alone ,</l>
     <l n="576">Amid life 's pains , abasements , emptiness ,</l>
     <l n="577">The soul can comfort , elevate , and fill .</l>
     <l n="578">That only , and that amply , this performs ;</l>
     <l n="579">Lifts us above life 's pains , her joys above ;</l>
     <l n="580">Their terror those , and these their lustre lose ;</l>
     <l n="581">Eternity depending covers all ;</l>
     <l n="582">Eternity depending all achieves ; 580</l>
     <l n="583">Sets earth at distance ; casts her into shades ;</l>
     <l n="584">Blends her distinctions ; abrogates her powers ;</l>
     <l n="585">The low , the lofty , joyous , and severe ,</l>
     <l n="586">Fortune 's dread frowns , and fascinating smiles ,</l>
     <l n="587">Make one promiscuous and neglected heap ,</l>
     <l n="588">The man beneath ; if I may call him man ,</l>
     <l n="589">Whom immortality 's full force inspires .</l>
     <l n="590">Nothing terrestrial touches his high thought ;</l>
     <l n="591">Suns shine unseen , and thunders roll unheard ,</l>
     <l n="592">By minds quite conscious of their high descent , 590</l>
     <l n="593">Their present province , and their future prize ;</l>
     <l n="594">Divinely darting upward every wish , 592</l>
     <l n="595">Warm on the wing , in glorious absence lost !</l>
     <l n="596">Doubt you this truth ? Why labours your belief ?</l>
     <l n="597">If earth 's whole orb by some due distanced eye</l>
     <l n="598">Were seen at once , her towering Alps would sink ,</l>
     <l n="599">And levell 'd Atlas leave an even sphere .</l>
     <l n="600">Thus earth , and all that earthly minds admire ,</l>
     <l n="601">Is swallow 'd in eternity 's vast round .</l>
     <l n="602">To that stupendous view , when souls awake , 600</l>
     <l n="603">So large of late , so mountainous to man ,</l>
     <l n="604">Time 's toys subside ; and equal all below .</l>
     <l n="605">Enthusiastic , this ? Then all are weak ,</l>
     <l n="606">But rank enthusiasts . To this godlike height</l>
     <l n="607">Some souls have soar 'd ; or martyrs ne'er had bled ,</l>
     <l n="608">And all may do , what has by man been done .</l>
     <l n="609">Who , beaten by these sublunary storms ,</l>
     <l n="610">Boundless , interminable joys can weigh ,</l>
     <l n="611">Unraptured , unexalted , uninflamed ?</l>
     <l n="612">What slave unblest , who from to-morrow 's dawn 610</l>
     <l n="613">Expects an empire ? He forgets his chain ,</l>
     <l n="614">And , throned in thought , his absent sceptre waves .</l>
     <l n="615">And what a sceptre waits us ! what a throne !</l>
     <l n="616">Her own immense appointments to compute ,</l>
     <l n="617">Or comprehend her high prerogatives ,</l>
     <l n="618">In this her dark minority , how toils ,</l>
     <l n="619">How vainly pants , the human soul divine !</l>
     <l n="620">Too great the bounty seems for earthly joy ;</l>
     <l n="621">What heart but trembles at so strange a bliss ?</l>
     <l n="622">In spite of all the truths the Muse has sung , 620</l>
     <l n="623">Ne'er to be prized enough ! enough revolved !</l>
     <l n="624">Are there who wrap the world so close about them ,</l>
     <l n="625">They see no farther than the clouds ; and dance</l>
     <l n="626">On heedless vanity 's fantastic toe ,</l>
     <l n="627">Till , stumbling at a straw , in their career ,</l>
     <l n="628">Headlong they plunge , where end both dance and song ?</l>
     <l n="629">Are there , Lorenzo ? is it possible ? 627</l>
     <l n="630">Are there on earth ( let me not call them men )</l>
     <l n="631">Who lodge a soul immortal in their breasts ;</l>
     <l n="632">Unconscious as the mountain of its ore ;</l>
     <l n="633">Or rock of its inestimable gem ?</l>
     <l n="634">When rocks shall melt , and mountains vanish , these</l>
     <l n="635">Shall know their treasure ; treasure , then , no more . 633</l>
     <l n="636">Are there ( still more amazing ! ) who resist</l>
     <l n="637">The rising thought ? who smother , in its birth ,</l>
     <l n="638">The glorious truth ? who struggle to be brutes ?</l>
     <l n="639">Who through this bosom-barrier burst their way ,</l>
     <l n="640">And , with reversed ambition , strive to sink ?</l>
     <l n="641">Who labour downwards through th ’ opposing powers</l>
     <l n="642">Of instinct , reason , and the world against them , 640</l>
     <l n="643">To dismal hopes , and shelter in the shock</l>
     <l n="644">Of endless night ; night darker than the grave 's ?</l>
     <l n="645">Who fight the proofs of immortality ?</l>
     <l n="646">With horrid zeal , and execrable arts ,</l>
     <l n="647">Work all their engines , level their black fires ,</l>
     <l n="648">To blot from man this attribute divine</l>
     <l n="649">( Than vital blood far dearer to the wise ) ,</l>
     <l n="650">Blasphemers , and rank atheists to themselves ?</l>
     <l n="651">To contradict them , see all nature rise !</l>
     <l n="652">What object , what event , the moon beneath , 650</l>
     <l n="653">But argues , or endears , an after-scene ?</l>
     <l n="654">To reason proves , or weds it to desire ?</l>
     <l n="655">All things proclaim it needful ; some advance</l>
     <l n="656">One precious step beyond , and prove it sure .</l>
     <l n="657">A thousand arguments swarm round my pen ,</l>
     <l n="658">From heaven , and earth , and man . Indulge a few ,</l>

     <l n="660">So pressing Providence a truth to teach ,</l>
     <l n="661">Which truth untaught , all other truths were vain .</l>
     <l n="662">Thou ! whose all-providential eye surveys , 660</l>

     <l n="679">Look nature through , ‘ tis revolution all ;</l>
     <l n="680">All change ; no death . Day follows night ; and night</l>
     <l n="681">The dying day ; stars rise , and set , and rise ;</l>
     <l n="682">Earth takes th ’ example . See , the summer gay , 680</l>
     <l n="683">With her green chaplet , and ambrosial flowers ,</l>
     <l n="684">Droops into pallid autumn : winter grey ,</l>
     <l n="685">Horrid with frost , and turbulent with storm ,</l>
     <l n="686">Blows autumn , and his golden fruits , away :</l>
     <l n="687">Then melts into the spring : soft spring , with breath</l>
     <l n="688">Favonian , from warm chambers of the south ,</l>
     <l n="689">Recalls the first . All , to re-flourish , fades ;</l>
     <l n="690">As in a wheel , all sinks , to re-ascend .</l>
     <l n="691">Emblems of man , who passes , not expires .</l>
     <l n="692">With this minute distinction , emblems just , 690</l>
     <l n="693">Nature revolves , but man advances ; both</l>
     <l n="694">Eternal , that a circle , this a line .</l>
     <l n="695">That gravitates , this soars . Th ’ aspiring soul ,</l>
     <l n="696">Ardent , and tremulous , like flame , ascends , 694</l>
     <l n="697">Zeal and humility her wings , to heaven .</l>
     <l n="698">The world of matter , with its various forms ,</l>
     <l n="699">All dies into new life . Life born from death</l>

     <l n="701">No single atom , once in being , lost ,</l>
     <l n="702">With change of counsel charges the Most High .</l>
     <l n="703">What hence infers Lorenzo ? Can it be ?</l>
     <l n="704">Matter immortal ? And shall Spirit die ? 702</l>
     <l n="705">Above the nobler , shall less noble rise ?</l>
     <l n="706">Shall Man alone , for whom all else revives ,</l>
     <l n="707">No resurrection know ? Shall Man alone ,</l>
     <l n="708">Imperial Man ! be sown in barren ground ,</l>

   <p>THE INFIDEL RECLAIMED . PART II . CONTAINING THE NATURE , PROOF , AND IMPORTANCE OF IMMORTALITY .</p>
   <p>PREFACE .</p>
   <p>As we are at war with the power , it were well if we were at war with the manners , of France . A land of levity is a land of guilt . A serious mind is the native soil of every virtue ; and the single character that does true honour to mankind . The soul 's immortality has been the favourite theme with the serious of all ages . Nor is it strange : it is a subject by far the most interesting and important that can enter the mind of man . Of highest moment this subject always was , and always will be . Yet this its highest moment seems to admit of increase , at this day ; a sort of occasional importance is superadded to the natural weight of it ; if that opinion which is advanced in the Preface to the preceding Night be just . It is there supposed , that all our infidels , whatever scheme , for argument 's sake , and to keep themselves in countenance , they patronise , are betrayed into their deplorable error , by some doubts of their immortality , at the bottom . And the more I consider this point , the more I am persuaded of the truth of that opinion . Though the distrust of a futurity is a strange error ; yet it is an error into which bad men may naturally be distressed . For it is impossible to bid defiance to final ruin , without some refuge in imagination , some presumption of escape . And what presumption is there ? There are but two in nature ; but two , within the compass of human thought . And these are ,— That either God will not , or can not , punish . Considering the divine attributes , the first is too gross to be digested by our strongest wishes . And since omnipotence is as much a divine attribute as holiness , that God cannot punish , is as absurd a supposition as the former . God certainly can punish as long as wicked men exist . In non-existence , therefore , is their only refuge ; and , consequently , non-existence is their strongest wish . And strong wishes have a strange influence on our opinions ; they bias the judgment in a manner almost incredible . And since on this member of their alternative , there are some very small appearances in their favour , and none at all on the other , they catch at this reed , they lay hold on this chimera , to save themselves from the shock and horror of an immediate and absolute despair .</p>
   <p>On reviewing my subject , by the light which this argument , and others of like tendency , threw upon it , I was more inclined than ever to pursue it , as it appeared to me to strike directly at the main root of all our infidelity . In the following pages it is , accordingly , pursued at large ; and some arguments for immortality , new at least to me , are ventured on in them . There also the writer has made an attempt to set the gross absurdities and horrors of annihilation in a fuller and more affecting view than is ( I think ) to be met with elsewhere .</p>
   <p>The gentlemen , for whose sake this attempt was chiefly made , profess great admiration for the wisdom of heathen antiquity : what pity it is they are not sincere ! If they were sincere , how would it mortify them to consider , with what contempt and abhorrence their notions would have been received by those whom they so much admire ! What degree of contempt and abhorrence would fall to their share , may be conjectured by the following matter of fact ( in my opinion ) extremely memorable . Of all their heathen worthies , Socrates ( it is well known ) was the most guarded , dispassionate , and composed : yet this great master of temper was angry ; and angry at his last hour ; and angry with his friend ; and angry for what deserved acknowledgment ; angry for a right and tender instance of true friendship towards him . Is not this surprising ? What could be the cause ? The cause was for his honour ; it was a truly noble , though , perhaps , a too punctilious , regard for immortality . For his friend asking him , with such an affectionate concern as became a friend , “ where he should deposit his remains , ” it was resented by Socrates , as implying a dishonourable supposition , that he could be so mean , as to have a regard for anything , even in himself , that was not immortal .</p>
   <p>This fact well considered , would make our infidels withdraw their admiration from Socrates ; or make them endeavour , by their imitation of this illustrious example , to share his glory : and , consequently , it would incline them to peruse the following pages with candour and impartiality ; which is all I desire ; and that , for their sakes : for I am persuaded , that an unprejudiced infidel must , necessarily , receive some advantageous impressions from them .</p>

    <head>CONTENTS .</head>

     <l n="29">Why Discontent for ever harbour 'd there ?</l>
     <l n="30">Incurable consumption of our peace ! 30</l>
     <l n="31">Resolve me , why , the cottager , and king ,</l>

     <l n="35">Disquieted alike , draw sigh for sigh ,</l>

     <l n="38">Deep in rich pasture will thy flocks complain ?</l>
     <l n="39">Not so ; but to their master is denied</l>

     <l n="57">Lorenzo , no ! they shall be nobly pain 'd ;</l>
     <l n="58">The glorious foreigners , distress 'd , shall sigh</l>
     <l n="59">On thrones ; and thou congratulate the sigh :</l>
     <l n="60">Man 's misery declares him born for bliss ; 60</l>
     <l n="61">His anxious heart asserts the truth I sing ,</l>
     <l n="62">And gives the sceptic in his head the lie .</l>
     <l n="63">Our heads , our hearts , our passions , and our powers ,</l>
     <l n="64">Speak the same language ; call us to the skies :</l>
     <l n="65">Unripen 'd these in this inclement clime ,</l>
     <l n="66">Scarce rise above conjecture , and mistake ;</l>
     <l n="67">And for this land of trifles those too strong</l>
     <l n="68">Tumultuous rise , and tempest human life : 68</l>
     <l n="69">What prize on earth can pay us for the storm ?</l>
     <l n="70">Meet objects for our passions Heaven ordain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="71">Objects that challenge all their fire , and leave</l>
     <l n="72">No fault , but in defect : bless 'd Heaven ! avert</l>
     <l n="73">A bounded ardour for unbounded bliss !</l>
     <l n="74">O for a bliss unbounded ! Far beneath</l>
     <l n="75">A soul immortal , is a mortal joy .</l>
     <l n="76">Nor are our powers to perish immature ;</l>
     <l n="77">But , after feeble effort here , beneath</l>
     <l n="78">A brighter sun , and in a nobler soil ,</l>
     <l n="79">Transplanted from this sublunary bed ,</l>
     <l n="80">Shall flourish fair , and put forth all their bloom . 80</l>
     <l n="81">Reason progressive , Instinct is complete ;</l>
     <l n="82">Swift Instinct leaps ; slow Reason feebly climbs .</l>
     <l n="83">Brutes soon their zenith reach ; their little all</l>
     <l n="84">Flows in at once ; in ages they no more</l>
     <l n="85">Could know , or do , or covet , or enjoy .</l>
     <l n="86">Were man to live coeval with the sun ,</l>
     <l n="87">The patriarch-pupil would be learning still ;</l>
     <l n="88">Yet , dying , leave his lesson half unlearn 'd .</l>
     <l n="89">Men perish in advance , as if the sun</l>
     <l n="90">Should set ere noon , in eastern oceans drown 'd ; 90</l>
     <l n="91">If fit , with dim , illustrious to compare ,</l>
     <l n="92">The sun 's meridian with the soul of man .</l>
     <l n="93">To man , why , stepdame Nature ! so severe ?</l>
     <l n="94">Why thrown aside thy masterpiece half wrought ,</l>
     <l n="95">While meaner efforts thy last hand enjoy ?</l>
     <l n="96">Or , if abortively , poor man must die ,</l>
     <l n="97">Nor reach , what reach he might , why die in dread ?</l>
     <l n="98">Why cursed with foresight ? wise to misery ?</l>
     <l n="99">Why of his proud prerogative the prey ?</l>
     <l n="100">Why less pre-eminent in rank than pain ? 100</l>
     <l n="101">His immortality alone can tell ;</l>
     <l n="102">Full ample fund to balance all amiss , 102</l>
     <l n="103">And turn the scale in favour of the just !</l>
     <l n="104">His immortality alone can solve</l>
     <l n="105">The darkest of enigmas , human hope ;</l>
     <l n="106">Of all the darkest , if at death we die .</l>
     <l n="107">Hope , eager Hope , th ’ assassin of our joy ,</l>
     <l n="108">All present blessings treading under foot ,</l>
     <l n="109">Is scarce a milder tyrant than Despair .</l>
     <l n="110">With no past toils content , still planting new , 110</l>
     <l n="111">Hope turns us o'er to death alone for ease .</l>
     <l n="112">Possession , why more tasteless than pursuit ?</l>
     <l n="113">Why is a wish far dearer than a crown ?</l>
     <l n="114">That wish accomplish 'd , why the grave of bliss ?</l>
     <l n="115">Because , in the great future buried deep ,</l>
     <l n="116">Beyond our plans of empire and renown ,</l>
     <l n="117">Lies all that man with ardour should pursue ;</l>
     <l n="118">And He who made him , bent him to the right .</l>
     <l n="119">Man 's heart th ’ Almighty to the future sets ,</l>
     <l n="120">By secret and inviolable springs ; 120</l>
     <l n="121">And makes his hope his sublunary joy .</l>
     <l n="122">Man 's heart eats all things , and is hungry still ;</l>
     <l n="123">“ More , more ! ” the glutton cries : for something new</l>
     <l n="124">So rages appetite , if man can n't mount ,</l>
     <l n="125">He will descend . He starves on the possess 'd .</l>
     <l n="126">Hence , the world 's master , from ambition 's spire ,</l>
     <l n="127">In Caprea plunged ; and dived beneath the brute .</l>
     <l n="128">In that rank sty why wallow 'd empire 's son</l>
     <l n="129">Supreme ? Because he could no higher fly ;</l>
     <l n="130">His riot was ambition in despair . 130</l>
     <l n="131">Old Rome consulted birds ; Lorenzo ! thou</l>
     <l n="132">With more success , the flight of Hope survey ;</l>
     <l n="133">Of restless Hope , for ever on the wing .</l>
     <l n="134">High perch 'd o'er every thought that falcon sits ,</l>
     <l n="135">To fly at all that rises in her sight ;</l>
     <l n="136">And never stooping , but to mount again 136</l>
     <l n="137">Next moment , she betrays her aim 's mistake ,</l>
     <l n="138">And owns her quarry lodged beyond the grave .</l>
     <l n="139">There should it fail us ( it must fail us there ,</l>
     <l n="140">If being fails ) , more mournful riddles rise ,</l>
     <l n="141">And Virtue vies with Hope in mystery .</l>
     <l n="142">Why Virtue ? where its praise , its being , fled ?</l>
     <l n="143">Virtue is true self-interest pursued : 143</l>
     <l n="144">What true self-interest of quite-mortal man ?</l>
     <l n="145">To close with all that makes him happy here .</l>
     <l n="146">If vice ( as sometimes ) is our friend on earth ,</l>
     <l n="147">Then vice is virtue ; ‘ tis our sovereign good .</l>
     <l n="148">In self-applause is virtue 's golden prize ;</l>
     <l n="149">No self-applause attends it on thy scheme :</l>
     <l n="150">Whence self-applause ? From conscience of the right .</l>
     <l n="151">And what is right , but means of happiness ? 151</l>
     <l n="152">No means of happiness when virtue yields ;</l>
     <l n="153">That basis failing , falls the building too ,</l>
     <l n="154">And lays in ruin every virtuous joy .</l>
     <l n="155">The rigid guardian of a blameless heart ,</l>
     <l n="156">So long revered , so long reputed wise ,</l>
     <l n="157">Is weak ; with rank knight-errantries o'errun .</l>
     <l n="158">Why beats thy bosom with illustrious dreams</l>
     <l n="159">Of self-exposure , laudable , and great ?</l>
     <l n="160">Of gallant enterprise , and glorious death ? 160</l>
     <l n="161">Die for thy country !— Thou romantic fool !</l>
     <l n="162">Seize , seize the plank thyself , and let her sink :</l>
     <l n="163">Thy country ! what to thee ?— the Godhead , what ?</l>
     <l n="164">( I speak with awe ! ) though He should bid thee bleed ?</l>
     <l n="165">If , with thy blood , thy final hope is spilt ,</l>
     <l n="166">Nor can Omnipotence reward the blow ,</l>
     <l n="167">Be deaf ; preserve thy being ; disobey .</l>
     <l n="168">Nor is it disobedience : know , Lorenzo !</l>
     <l n="169">Whate'er th ’ Almighty 's subsequent command ,</l>
     <l n="170">His first command is this :— “ Man , love thyself . ” 170</l>
     <l n="171">In this alone , free agents are not free .</l>
     <l n="172">Existence is the basis , bliss the prize ;</l>
     <l n="173">If virtue costs existence , ‘ tis a crime ;</l>
     <l n="174">Bold violation of our law supreme ,</l>
     <l n="175">Black suicide ; though nations , which consult</l>
     <l n="176">Their gain , at thy expence , resound applause .</l>
     <l n="177">Since Virtue 's recompence is doubtful , here ,</l>
     <l n="178">If man dies wholly , well may we demand ,</l>
     <l n="179">Why is man suffer 'd to be good in vain ?</l>
     <l n="180">Why to be good in vain , is man enjoin 'd ? 180</l>
     <l n="181">Why to be good in vain , is man betray 'd ?</l>
     <l n="182">Betray 'd by traitors lodged in his own breast ,</l>
     <l n="183">By sweet complacencies from virtue felt ?</l>
     <l n="184">Why whispers Nature lies on Virtue 's part ?</l>
     <l n="185">Or if blind Instinct ( which assumes the name</l>
     <l n="186">Of sacred conscience ) plays the fool in man ,</l>
     <l n="187">Why Reason made accomplice in the cheat ?</l>
     <l n="188">Why are the wisest loudest in her praise ?</l>
     <l n="189">Can man by Reason 's beam be led astray ?</l>
     <l n="190">Or , at his peril , imitate his God ? 190</l>
     <l n="191">Since virtue sometimes ruins us on earth ,</l>
     <l n="192">Or both are true , or man survives the grave .</l>
     <l n="193">Or man survives the grave , or own , Lorenzo ,</l>
     <l n="194">Thy boast supreme , a wild absurdity .</l>
     <l n="195">Dauntless thy spirit ; cowards are thy scorn .</l>
     <l n="196">Grant man immortal , and thy scorn is just .</l>
     <l n="197">The man immortal , rationally brave ,</l>
     <l n="198">Dares rush on death — because he cannot die .</l>
     <l n="199">But if man loses all , when life is lost ,</l>
     <l n="200">He lives a coward , or a fool expires . 200</l>
     <l n="201">A daring infidel ( and such there are ,</l>
     <l n="202">From pride , example , lucre , rage , revenge ,</l>
     <l n="203">Or pure heroical defect of thought ) , 203</l>
     <l n="204">Of all earth 's madmen , most deserves a chain .</l>
     <l n="205">When to the grave we follow the renown 'd</l>

     <l n="313">O sole and sweet solution ! that unties</l>
     <l n="314">The difficult , and softens the severe ;</l>

     <l n="320">Each virtue brings in hand a golden dower , 320</l>
     <l n="321">Far richer in reversion : Hope exults ;</l>

     <l n="323">Predominates , and gives the taste of heaven .</l>
     <l n="324">O wherefore is the Deity so kind ?</l>
     <l n="325">Astonishing beyond astonishment !</l>
     <l n="326">Heaven our reward — for heaven enjoy 'd below .</l>
     <l n="327">Still unsubdued thy stubborn heart ?— for there</l>

     <l n="329">Reason is guiltless ; will alone rebels .</l>
     <l n="330">What , in that stubborn heart , if I should find 330</l>
     <l n="331">New , unexpected witnesses against thee ?</l>
     <l n="332">Ambition , pleasure , and the love of gain !</l>
     <l n="333">Canst thou suspect that these , which make the soul</l>
     <l n="334">The slave of earth , should own her heir of heaven ?</l>
     <l n="335">Canst thou suspect what makes us disbelieve</l>
     <l n="336">Our immortality , should prove it sure ?</l>
     <l n="337">First , then , Ambition summon to the bar .</l>
     <l n="338">Ambition 's shame , extravagance , disgust 338</l>
     <l n="339">And inextinguishable nature , speak .</l>
     <l n="340">Each much deposes ; hear them in their turn .</l>
     <l n="341">Thy soul , how passionately fond of fame !</l>
     <l n="342">How anxious , that fond passion to conceal !</l>
     <l n="343">We blush , detected in designs on praise ,</l>
     <l n="344">Though for best deeds , and from the best of men :</l>
     <l n="345">And why ? Because immortal . Art divine</l>
     <l n="346">Has made the body tutor to the soul ;</l>
     <l n="347">Heaven kindly gives our blood a moral flow ;</l>
     <l n="348">Bids it ascend the glowing cheek , and there</l>
     <l n="349">Upbraid that little heart 's inglorious aim ,</l>
     <l n="350">Which stoops to court a character from man ; 350</l>
     <l n="351">While o'er us , in tremendous judgment sit</l>
     <l n="352">Far more than man , with endless praise , and blame .</l>
     <l n="353">Ambition 's boundless appetite outspeaks</l>
     <l n="354">The verdict of its shame . When souls take fire</l>
     <l n="355">At high presumptions of their own desert ,</l>
     <l n="356">One age is poor applause ; the mighty shout ,</l>
     <l n="357">The thunder by the living few begun ,</l>
     <l n="358">Late time must echo ; worlds unborn resound .</l>
     <l n="359">We wish our names eternally to live :</l>
     <l n="360">Wild dream ! which ne'er had haunted human thought ,</l>
     <l n="361">Had not our natures been eternal too . 361</l>
     <l n="362">Instinct points out an interest in hereafter ;</l>
     <l n="363">But our blind reason sees not where it lies ;</l>
     <l n="364">Or , seeing , gives the substance for the shade .</l>
     <l n="365">Fame is the shade of immortality ,</l>
     <l n="366">And in itself a shadow . Soon as caught ,</l>
     <l n="367">Contemn 'd ; it shrinks to nothing in the grasp .</l>
     <l n="368">Consult th ’ ambitious , ‘ tis ambition 's cure .</l>
     <l n="369">“ And is this all ? ” cried Caesar at his height ,</l>
     <l n="370">Disgusted . This third proof Ambition brings 370</l>
     <l n="371">Of immortality . The first in fame .</l>
     <l n="372">Observe him near , your envy will abate : 372</l>
     <l n="373">Shamed at the disproportion vast , between</l>
     <l n="374">The passion and the purchase , he will sigh</l>
     <l n="375">At such success , and blush at his renown .</l>
     <l n="376">And why ? Because far richer prize invites</l>
     <l n="377">His heart ; far more illustrious glory calls :</l>
     <l n="378">It calls in whispers , yet the deafest hear .</l>
     <l n="379">And can Ambition a fourth proof supply ?</l>
     <l n="380">It can , and stronger than the former three ; 380</l>
     <l n="381">Yet quite o'erlook ' d by some reputed wise .</l>
     <l n="382">Though disappointments in ambition pain ,</l>
     <l n="383">And though success disgusts ; yet still , Lorenzo !</l>
     <l n="384">In vain we strive to pluck it from our hearts ;</l>
     <l n="385">By Nature planted for the noblest ends .</l>
     <l n="386">Absurd the famed advice to Pyrrhus<span type="note_anchor">[ 34 ]</span>given ,</l>
     <l n="387">More praised , than ponder 'd ; specious , but unsound ;</l>
     <l n="388">Sooner that hero 's sword the world had quell 'd ,</l>
     <l n="389">Than Reason , his ambition . Man must soar .</l>
     <l n="390">An obstinate activity within , 390</l>
     <l n="391">An insuppressive spring , will toss him up</l>
     <l n="392">In spite of Fortune 's load . Not kings alone ,</l>
     <l n="393">Each villager has his ambition too ;</l>
     <l n="394">No Sultan prouder than his fetter 'd slave :</l>
     <l n="395">Slaves build their little Babylons of straw ,</l>
     <l n="396">Echo the proud Assyrian , in their hearts ,</l>
     <l n="397">And cry ,— “ Behold the wonders of my might ! ”</l>
     <l n="398">And why ? Because immortal as their lord ;</l>
     <l n="399">And souls immortal must for ever heave</l>
     <l n="400">At something great ; the glitter , or the gold ; 400</l>
     <l n="401">The praise of mortals , or the praise of Heaven .</l>
     <l n="402">Nor absolutely vain is human praise ,</l>
     <l n="403">When human is supported by divine .</l>
     <l n="404">I 'll introduce Lorenzo to himself ; 404</l>
     <l n="405">Pleasure and Pride ( bad masters ! ) share our hearts .</l>
     <l n="406">As love of pleasure is ordain 'd to guard</l>
     <l n="407">And feed our bodies , and extend our race ;</l>
     <l n="408">The love of praise is planted to protect ,</l>
     <l n="409">And propagate the glories of the mind .</l>
     <l n="410">What is it , but the love of praise , inspires ,</l>
     <l n="411">Matures , refines , embellishes , exalts ,</l>
     <l n="412">Earth 's happiness ? From that , the delicate , 412</l>
     <l n="413">The grand , the marvellous , of civil life ,</l>
     <l n="414">Want and convenience , underworkers , lay</l>
     <l n="415">The basis , on which love of glory builds .</l>
     <l n="416">Nor is thy life , O Virtue ! less in debt</l>
     <l n="417">To praise , thy secret stimulating friend .</l>
     <l n="418">Were men not proud , what merit should we miss !</l>
     <l n="419">Pride made the virtues of the Pagan world .</l>
     <l n="420">Praise is the salt that seasons right to man , 420</l>
     <l n="421">And whets his appetite for moral good .</l>
     <l n="422">Thirst of applause is Virtue 's second guard ;</l>
     <l n="423">Reason , her first ; but reason wants an aid ;</l>
     <l n="424">Our private reason is a flatterer ;</l>
     <l n="425">Thirst of applause calls public judgment in ,</l>
     <l n="426">To poise our own , to keep an even scale ,</l>
     <l n="427">And give endanger 'd Virtue fairer play .</l>
     <l n="428">Here a fifth proof arises , stronger still :</l>
     <l n="429">Why this so nice construction of our hearts ?</l>
     <l n="430">These delicate moralities of sense ; 430</l>
     <l n="431">This constitutional reserve of aid</l>
     <l n="432">To succour virtue , when our reason fails ;</l>
     <l n="433">If virtue , kept alive by care and toil ,</l>
     <l n="434">And oft , the mark of injuries on earth ,</l>
     <l n="435">When labour 'd to maturity ( its bill</l>
     <l n="436">Of disciplines , and pains , unpaid ) , must die ?</l>
     <l n="437">Why freighted rich , to dash against a rock ?</l>
     <l n="438">Were man to perish when most fit to live , 438</l>
     <l n="439">O how misspent were all these stratagems ,</l>
     <l n="440">By skill divine inwoven in our frame !</l>
     <l n="441">Where are Heaven 's holiness and mercy fled ?</l>
     <l n="442">Laughs Heaven , at once , at Virtue , and at Man ?</l>
     <l n="443">If not , why that discouraged , this destroy 'd ?</l>
     <l n="444">Thus far Ambition . What says Avarice ?</l>
     <l n="445">This her chief maxim , which has long been thine :</l>
     <l n="446">“ The wise and wealthy are the same , ” — I grant it .</l>
     <l n="447">To store up treasure with incessant toil ,</l>
     <l n="448">This is man 's province , this his highest praise .</l>
     <l n="449">To this great end keen Instinct stings him on .</l>
     <l n="450">To guide that instinct , Reason ! is thy charge ; 450</l>
     <l n="451">‘ Tis thine to tell us where true treasure lies :</l>
     <l n="452">But , Reason failing to discharge her trust ,</l>

     <l n="454">A blunder follows ; and blind Industry ,</l>
     <l n="455">Gall 'd by the spur , but stranger to the course</l>
     <l n="456">( The course where stakes of more than gold are won ) ,</l>

     <l n="460">“ Thou shalt not covet , ” is a wise command ; 460</l>
     <l n="461">But bounded to the wealth the sun surveys :</l>
     <l n="462">Look farther , the command stands quite reversed ,</l>
     <l n="463">And avarice is a virtue most divine .</l>
     <l n="464">Is faith a refuge for our happiness ?</l>
     <l n="465">Most sure : and is it not for reason too ?</l>
     <l n="466">Nothing this world unriddles , but the next .</l>
     <l n="467">Whence inextinguishable thirst of gain ?</l>
     <l n="468">From inextinguishable life in man .</l>
     <l n="469">Man , if not meant , by worth , to reach the skies ,</l>
     <l n="470">Had wanted wing to fly so far in guilt . 470</l>
     <l n="471">Sour grapes , I grant , ambition , avarice ,</l>
     <l n="472">Yet still their root is immortality : 472</l>
     <l n="473">These its wild growths so bitter , and so base ,</l>
     <l n="474">( Pain and reproach ! ) Religion can reclaim ,</l>
     <l n="475">Refine , exalt , throw down their poisonous lee ,</l>
     <l n="476">And make them sparkle in the bowl of bliss .</l>
     <l n="477">See , the third witness laughs at bliss remote ,</l>
     <l n="478">And falsely promises an Eden here :</l>
     <l n="479">Truth she shall speak for once , though prone to lie ,</l>
     <l n="480">A common cheat , and Pleasure is her name . 480</l>
     <l n="481">To Pleasure never was Lorenzo deaf ;</l>
     <l n="482">Then hear her now , now first thy real friend .</l>
     <l n="483">Since Nature made us not more fond than proud</l>
     <l n="484">Of happiness ( whence hypocrites in joy !</l>
     <l n="485">Makers of mirth ! artificers of smiles ! ) ,</l>
     <l n="486">Why should the joy most poignant sense affords ,</l>
     <l n="487">Burn us with blushes , and rebuke our pride ?—</l>
     <l n="488">Those heaven-born blushes tell us man descends ,</l>
     <l n="489">Even in the zenith of his earthly bliss :</l>
     <l n="490">Should Reason take her infidel repose , 490</l>
     <l n="491">This honest instinct speaks our lineage high ;</l>
     <l n="492">This instinct calls on darkness to conceal</l>
     <l n="493">Our rapturous relation to the stalls .</l>
     <l n="494">Our glory covers us with noble shame ,</l>
     <l n="495">And he that 's unconfounded , is unmann 'd .</l>
     <l n="496">The man that blushes , is not quite a brute .</l>
     <l n="497">Thus far with thee , Lorenzo , will I close :</l>
     <l n="498">Pleasure is good , and man for pleasure made ;</l>
     <l n="499">But pleasure full of glory , as of joy ;</l>
     <l n="500">Pleasure , which neither blushes , nor expires . 500</l>
     <l n="501">The witnesses are heard ; the cause is o'er ;</l>

     <l n="1372">Pert infidelity is Wit 's cockade ,</l>

     <l n="1406">To close , Lorenzo ! spite of all my pains ,</l>
     <l n="1407">Still seems it strange , that thou should'st live for ever ?</l>
     <l n="1408">Is it less strange , that thou should'st live at all ?</l>
     <l n="1409">This is a miracle ; and that no more .</l>
     <l n="1410">Who gave beginning , can exclude an end . 1410</l>

     <l n="1416">Admit a God — that mystery supreme !</l>
     <l n="1417">That Cause uncaused ! all other wonders cease ;</l>
     <l n="1418">Nothing is marvellous for Him to do :</l>
     <l n="1419">Deny Him — all is mystery besides ;</l>
     <l n="1420">Millions of mysteries ! each darker far ,</l>
     <l n="1421">Than that thy wisdom would , unwisely , shun .</l>
     <l n="1422">If weak thy faith , why choose the harder side ? 1422</l>
     <l n="1423">We nothing know , but what is marvellous ;</l>
     <l n="1424">Yet what is marvellous , we can n't believe .</l>
     <l n="1425">So weak our reason , and so great our God ,</l>
     <l n="1426">What most surprises in the sacred page ,</l>
     <l n="1427">Or full as strange , or stranger , must be true .</l>

     <l n="1429">To faith , and virtue , why so backward , man ?</l>
     <l n="1430">From hence :— the present strongly strikes us all ; 1430</l>
     <l n="1431">The future , faintly : can we , then , be men ?</l>
     <l n="1432">If men , Lorenzo ! the reverse is right .</l>
     <l n="1433">Reason is man 's peculiar : Sense , the brute 's .</l>
     <l n="1434">The present is the scanty realm of Sense ;</l>
     <l n="1435">The future , Reason 's empire unconfined :</l>
     <l n="1436">On that expending all her godlike power ,</l>
     <l n="1437">She plans , provides , expatiates , triumphs , there ;</l>
     <l n="1438">There , builds her blessings ; there , expects her praise ;</l>
     <l n="1439">And nothing asks of Fortune , or of men .</l>
     <l n="1440">And what is Reason ? Be she thus defined ; 1440</l>
     <l n="1441">Reason is upright stature in the soul .</l>
     <l n="1442">Oh ! be a man ;— and strive to be a god .</l>
     <l n="1443">“ For what ? ( thou say'st ) — to damp the joys of life ? ”</l>
     <l n="1444">No ; to give heart and substance to thy joys .</l>
     <l n="1445">That tyrant , Hope ; mark how she domineers ;</l>
     <l n="1446">She bids us quit realities , for dreams ;</l>
     <l n="1447">Safety and peace , for hazard and alarm ;</l>
     <l n="1448">That tyrant o'er the tyrants of the soul , 1448</l>
     <l n="1449">She bids Ambition quit its taken prize ,</l>
     <l n="1450">Spurn the luxuriant branch on which it sits ,</l>
     <l n="1451">Though bearing crowns , to spring at distant game ;</l>
     <l n="1452">And plunge in toils and dangers — for repose .</l>
     <l n="1453">If hope precarious , and of things , when gain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="1454">Of little moment , and as little stay ,</l>
     <l n="1455">Can sweeten toils and dangers into joys ;</l>
     <l n="1456">What then , that hope , which nothing can defeat ,</l>
     <l n="1457">Our leave unask 'd ? rich hope of boundless bliss !</l>
     <l n="1458">Bliss , past Man 's power to paint it ; Time 's , to close !</l>
     <l n="1459">This hope is earth 's most estimable prize :</l>
     <l n="1460">This is man 's portion , while no more than man : 1460</l>
     <l n="1461">Hope , of all passions , most befriends us here ;</l>
     <l n="1462">Passions of prouder name befriend us less .</l>
     <l n="1463">Joy has her tears ; and Transport has her death ;</l>
     <l n="1464">Hope , like a cordial , innocent , though strong ,</l>
     <l n="1465">Man 's heart , at once , inspirits , and serenes ;</l>
     <l n="1466">Nor makes him pay his wisdom for his joys ;</l>

     <l n="1468">Health to the frame ! and vigour to the mind !</l>
     <l n="1469">A joy attemper 'd ! a chastised delight !</l>
     <l n="1470">Like the fair summer evening , mild , and sweet ! 1470</l>
     <l n="1471">‘ Tis man 's full cup ; his paradise below !</l>
     <l n="1472">A blest hereafter , then , or hoped , or gain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="1473">Is all ;— our whole of happiness : full proof ,</l>
     <l n="1474">I chose no trivial or inglorious theme .</l>
     <l n="1475">And know , ye foes to song ! ( well-meaning men ,</l>
     <l n="1476">Though quite forgotten half your Bible 's<span type="note_anchor">[ 42 ]</span>praise ! )</l>
     <l n="1477">Important truths , in spite of verse , may please :</l>
     <l n="1478">Grave minds you praise ; nor can you praise too much :</l>
     <l n="1479">If there is weight in an eternity ,</l>

   <p>VIRTUE 'S APOLOGY ; OR , THE MAN OF THE WORLD ANSWERED . IN WHICH ARE CONSIDERED , THE LOVE OF THIS LIFE ; THE AMBITION AND PLEASURE , WITH THE WIT AND WISDOM , OF THE WORLD .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>NIGHT EIGHTH</head>
    <head>VIRTUE 'S APOLOGY .</head>
     <l n="1">And has all nature , then , espoused my part ?</l>
     <l n="2">Have I bribed heaven , and earth , to plead against thee ?</l>
     <l n="3">And is thy soul immortal ?— What remains ?</l>
     <l n="4">All , all , Lorenzo !— Make immortal blest .</l>
     <l n="5">Unblest immortals !— What can shock us more ?</l>
     <l n="6">And yet Lorenzo still affects the world ;</l>
     <l n="7">There stows his treasure ; thence his title draws ,</l>
     <l n="8">Man of the world ( for such would'st thou be call 'd ) ,</l>
     <l n="9">And art thou proud of that inglorious style ?</l>
     <l n="10">Proud of reproach ? for a reproach it was , 10</l>
     <l n="11">In ancient days ; and Christian ,— in an age ,</l>
     <l n="12">When men were men , and not ashamed of heaven ,</l>
     <l n="13">Fired their ambition , as it crown 'd their joy .</l>
     <l n="14">Sprinkled with dews from the Castalian font ,</l>
     <l n="15">Fain would I re-baptize thee , and confer</l>
     <l n="16">A purer spirit , and a nobler name .</l>
     <l n="17">Thy fond attachments , fatal , and inflamed ,</l>
     <l n="18">Point out my path , and dictate to my song :</l>
     <l n="19">To thee , the world how fair ! how strongly strikes</l>
     <l n="20">Ambition ! and gay pleasure stronger still ! 20</l>
     <l n="21">Thy triple bane ! the triple bolt that lays 21</l>
     <l n="22">Thy virtue dead ! Be these my triple theme ;</l>
     <l n="23">Nor shall thy wit , or wisdom , be forgot .</l>
     <l n="24">Common the theme ; not so the song ; if she</l>
     <l n="25">My song invokes , Urania deigns to smile .</l>
     <l n="26">The charm that chains us to the world , her foe ,</l>
     <l n="27">If she dissolves , the man of earth , at once ,</l>
     <l n="28">Starts from his trance , and sighs for other scenes ;</l>
     <l n="29">Scenes , where these sparks of night , these stars shall shine</l>
     <l n="30">Unnumber 'd suns ( for all things , as they are , 30</l>
     <l n="31">The blest behold ) ; and , in one glory , pour</l>
     <l n="32">Their blended blaze on man 's astonish 'd sight ;</l>
     <l n="33">A blaze — the least illustrious object there .</l>
     <l n="34">Lorenzo ! since eternal is at hand ,</l>
     <l n="35">To swallow Time 's ambitions ; as the vast</l>
     <l n="36">Leviathan , the bubbles vain , that ride</l>
     <l n="37">High on the foaming billow ; what avail</l>
     <l n="38">High titles , high descent , attainments high ,</l>
     <l n="39">If unattain 'd our highest ? O Lorenzo !</l>
     <l n="40">What lofty thoughts , these elements above , 40</l>
     <l n="41">What towering hopes , what sallies from the sun ,</l>
     <l n="42">What grand surveys of destiny divine ,</l>
     <l n="43">And pompous presage of unfathom 'd fate ,</l>
     <l n="44">Should roll in bosoms , where a spirit burns ,</l>
     <l n="45">Bound for eternity ! in bosoms read</l>
     <l n="46">By Him , who foibles in archangels sees !</l>
     <l n="47">On human hearts He bends a jealous eye ,</l>
     <l n="48">And marks , and in heaven 's register enrols ,</l>
     <l n="49">The rise , and progress , of each option there ;</l>
     <l n="50">Sacred to doomsday ! That the page unfolds , 50</l>
     <l n="51">And spreads us to the gaze of gods and men .</l>
     <l n="52">And what an option , O Lorenzo , thine !</l>
     <l n="53">This world ! and this , unrivall 'd by the skies !</l>
     <l n="54">A world , where lust of pleasure , grandeur , gold ,</l>
     <l n="55">Three demons that divide its realms between them , 55</l>
     <l n="56">With strokes alternate buffet to and fro</l>
     <l n="57">Man 's restless heart , their sport , their flying ball ;</l>
     <l n="58">Till , with the giddy circle sick , and tired ,</l>
     <l n="59">It pants for peace , and drops into despair .</l>
     <l n="60">Such is the world Lorenzo sets above</l>
     <l n="61">That glorious promise angels were esteem 'd</l>
     <l n="62">Too mean to bring ; a promise , their Adored 62</l>
     <l n="63">Descended to communicate , and press ,</l>
     <l n="64">By counsel , miracle , life , death , on man .</l>
     <l n="65">Such is the world Lorenzo 's wisdom woos ,</l>
     <l n="66">And on its thorny pillow seeks repose ;</l>
     <l n="67">A pillow , which , like opiates ill prepared ,</l>
     <l n="68">Intoxicates , but not composes ; fills</l>
     <l n="69">The visionary mind with gay chimeras ,</l>
     <l n="70">All the wild trash of sleep , without the rest ; 70</l>
     <l n="71">What unfeign 'd travel , and what dreams of joy !</l>
     <l n="72">How frail , men , things ! how momentary , both !</l>
     <l n="73">Fantastic chase of shadows hunting shades !</l>
     <l n="74">The gay , the busy , equal though unlike ;</l>
     <l n="75">Equal in wisdom , differently wise !</l>
     <l n="76">Through flowery meadows , and through dreary wastes ,</l>
     <l n="77">One bustling , and one dancing , into death .</l>
     <l n="78">There 's not a day , but , to the man of thought ,</l>
     <l n="79">Betrays some secret , that throws new reproach</l>
     <l n="80">On life , and makes him sick of seeing more . 80</l>
     <l n="81">The scenes of business tell us — “ What are men ; ”</l>
     <l n="82">The scenes of pleasure — “ What is all beside ; ”</l>
     <l n="83">There , others we despise ; and here , ourselves :</l>
     <l n="84">Amid disgust eternal , dwells delight ?</l>
     <l n="85">‘ Tis approbation strikes the string of joy .</l>
     <l n="86">What wondrous prize has kindled this career ,</l>
     <l n="87">Stuns with the din , and chokes us with the dust ,</l>
     <l n="88">On life 's gay stage , one inch above the grave ?</l>
     <l n="89">The proud run up and down in quest of eyes ; 89</l>
     <l n="90">The sensual , in pursuit of something worse ;</l>
     <l n="91">The grave , of gold ; the politic , of power ;</l>
     <l n="92">And all , of other butterflies , as vain !</l>
     <l n="93">As eddies draw things frivolous , and light ,</l>
     <l n="94">How is man 's heart by vanity drawn in ;</l>
     <l n="95">On the swift circle of returning toys ,</l>
     <l n="96">Whirl 'd , straw-like , round and round , and then engulf 'd ,</l>
     <l n="97">Where gay delusion darkens to despair !</l>
     <l n="98">“ This is a beaten track . ” — Is this a track</l>
     <l n="99">Should not be beaten ? Never beat enough ,</l>
     <l n="100">Till enough learn 'd the truths it would inspire . 100</l>
     <l n="101">Shall Truth be silent , because Folly frowns ?</l>
     <l n="102">Turn the world 's history ; what find we there ,</l>
     <l n="103">But Fortune 's sports , or Nature 's cruel claims ,</l>
     <l n="104">Or Woman 's artifice , or Man 's revenge ,</l>
     <l n="105">And endless inhumanities on man ?</l>
     <l n="106">Fame 's trumpet seldom sounds , but , like the knell ,</l>
     <l n="107">It brings bad tidings : how it hourly blows</l>
     <l n="108">Man 's misadventures round the listening world !</l>
     <l n="109">Man is the tale of narrative old time ;</l>
     <l n="110">Sad tale ; which high as Paradise begins ; 110</l>
     <l n="111">As if , the toil of travel to delude ,</l>
     <l n="112">From stage to stage , in his eternal round ,</l>
     <l n="113">The Days , his daughters , as they spin our hours</l>
     <l n="114">On Fortune 's wheel , where accident unthought</l>
     <l n="115">Oft , in a moment , snaps life 's strongest thread ,</l>
     <l n="116">Each , in her turn , some tragic story tells ,</l>
     <l n="117">With , now and then , a wretched farce between ;</l>
     <l n="118">And fills his chronicle with human woes .</l>
     <l n="119">Time 's daughters , true as those of men , deceive us ;</l>
     <l n="120">Not one , but puts some cheat on all mankind : 120</l>
     <l n="121">While in their father 's bosom , not yet ours ,</l>
     <l n="122">They flatter our fond hopes , and promise much</l>
     <l n="123">Of amiable ; but hold him not o'erhYpppHeNwise , 123</l>
     <l n="124">Who dares to trust them ; and laugh round the year</l>
     <l n="125">At still-confiding , still-confounded , man ,</l>
     <l n="126">Confiding , though confounded ; hoping on ,</l>
     <l n="127">Untaught by trial , unconvinced by proof ,</l>
     <l n="128">And ever looking for the never seen .</l>
     <l n="129">Life to the last , like harden 'd felons , lies ;</l>
     <l n="130">Nor owns itself a cheat , till it expires . 130</l>
     <l n="131">Its little joys go out by one and one ,</l>
     <l n="132">And leave poor man , at length , in perfect night ;</l>
     <l n="133">Night darker , than what , now , involves the pole .</l>
     <l n="134">O Thou , who dost permit these ills to fall ,</l>
     <l n="135">For gracious ends , and would'st that man should mourn !</l>
     <l n="136">O Thou , whose hands this goodly fabric framed ,</l>
     <l n="137">Who know'st it best , and would'st that man should know !</l>
     <l n="138">What is this sublunary world ? A vapour ;</l>
     <l n="139">A vapour all it holds ; itself , a vapour ;</l>
     <l n="140">From the damp bed of chaos , by Thy beam 140</l>
     <l n="141">Exhaled , ordain 'd to swim its destined hour</l>
     <l n="142">In ambient air , then melt , and disappear .</l>
     <l n="143">Earth 's days are number 'd , nor remote her doom ;</l>
     <l n="144">As mortal , though less transient , than her sons ;</l>
     <l n="145">Yet they doat on her , as the world and they</l>
     <l n="146">Were both eternal , solid ; Thou , a dream .</l>
     <l n="147">They doat !— on what ? Immortal views apart ,</l>
     <l n="148">A region of outsides ! a land of shadows !</l>
     <l n="149">A fruitful field of flowery promises !</l>
     <l n="150">A wilderness of joys ! perplex 'd with doubts , 150</l>
     <l n="151">And sharp with thorns ! a troubled ocean , spread</l>
     <l n="152">With bold adventurers , their all on board !</l>
     <l n="153">No second hope , if here their fortune frowns ;</l>
     <l n="154">Frown soon it must . Of various rates they sail ,</l>
     <l n="155">Of ensigns various ; all alike in this ,</l>
     <l n="156">All restless , anxious ; toss 'd with hopes , and fears ,</l>
     <l n="157">In calmest skies ; obnoxious all to storm ; 157</l>
     <l n="158">And stormy the most general blast of life :</l>
     <l n="159">All bound for happiness ; yet few provide</l>
     <l n="160">The chart of knowledge , pointing where it lies ;</l>
     <l n="161">Or Virtue 's helm , to shape the course design 'd :</l>
     <l n="162">All , more or less , capricious fate lament ,</l>
     <l n="163">Now lifted by the tide , and now resorb 'd , 163</l>
     <l n="164">And farther from their wishes than before :</l>
     <l n="165">All , more or less , against each other dash .</l>
     <l n="166">To mutual hurt , by gusts of passion driven ,</l>

     <l n="466">Pronounce them weak , or worthy ; great , or mean .</l>
     <l n="467">How mean that snuff<span type="note_anchor">[ 46 ]</span>of glory Fortune lights ,</l>
     <l n="468">And Death puts out ! Dost thou demand a test ,</l>
     <l n="469">A test , at once , infallible , and short ,</l>
     <l n="470">Of real greatness ? That man greatly lives , 470</l>
     <l n="471">Whate'er his fate , or fame , who greatly dies ;</l>
     <l n="472">High-flush 'd with hope , where heroes shall despair .</l>
     <l n="473">If this a true criterion , many courts ,</l>
     <l n="474">Illustrious , might afford but few grandees .</l>
     <l n="475">Th ’ Almighty , from his throne , on earth surveys</l>
     <l n="476">Nought greater , than an honest , humble heart ;</l>
     <l n="477">An humble heart , His residence ! pronounced</l>
     <l n="478">His second seat ; and rival to the skies .</l>
     <l n="479">The private path , the secret acts of men ,</l>
     <l n="480">If noble , far the noblest of our lives ! 480</l>
     <l n="481">How far above Lorenzo 's glory sits</l>
     <l n="482">Th ’ illustrious master of a name unknown ;</l>
     <l n="483">Whose worth unrivall 'd , and unwitness 'd , loves</l>
     <l n="484">Life 's sacred shades , where gods converse with men ;</l>
     <l n="485">And Peace , beyond the world 's conceptions , smiles !</l>
     <l n="486">As thou ( now dark ) , before we part , shalt see .</l>
     <l n="487">But thy great soul this skulking glory scorns .</l>
     <l n="488">Lorenzo 's sick , but when Lorenzo 's seen ;</l>
     <l n="489">And , when he shrugs at public business , lies .</l>
     <l n="490">Denied the public eye , the public voice , 490</l>
     <l n="491">As if he lived on others ’ breath , he dies .</l>
     <l n="492">Fain would he make the world his pedestal ; 492</l>
     <l n="493">Mankind the gazers , the sole figure , he .</l>
     <l n="494">Knows he , that mankind praise against their will ,</l>
     <l n="495">And mix as much detraction as they can ?</l>
     <l n="496">Knows he , that faithless Fame her whisper has ,</l>
     <l n="497">As well as trumpet ? that his vanity</l>
     <l n="498">Is so much tickled from not hearing all ?</l>
     <l n="499">Knows this all-knower , that from itch of praise ,</l>
     <l n="500">Or , from an itch more sordid , when he shines , 500</l>
     <l n="501">Taking his country by five hundred ears ,</l>
     <l n="502">Senates at once admire him , and despise ,</l>
     <l n="503">With modest laughter lining loud applause ,</l>
     <l n="504">Which makes the smile more mortal to his fame ?</l>
     <l n="505">His fame , which ( like the mighty Caesar ) , crown 'd</l>
     <l n="506">With laurels , in full senate , greatly falls ,</l>
     <l n="507">By seeming friends , that honour , and destroy .</l>
     <l n="508">We rise in glory , as we sink in pride :</l>
     <l n="509">Where boasting ends , there dignity begins :</l>
     <l n="510">And yet , mistaken beyond all mistake , 510</l>
     <l n="511">The blind Lorenzo 's proud — of being proud ;</l>
     <l n="512">And dreams himself ascending in his fall .</l>
     <l n="513">An eminence , though fancied , turns the brain :</l>
     <l n="514">All vice wants hellebore ; but of all vice ,</l>
     <l n="515">Pride loudest calls , and for the largest bowl ;</l>
     <l n="516">Because , unlike all other vice , it flies ,</l>
     <l n="517">In fact , the point , in fancy most pursued .</l>
     <l n="518">Who court applause , oblige the world in this ;</l>
     <l n="519">They gratify man 's passion to refuse .</l>
     <l n="520">Superior honour , when assumed , is lost ; 520</l>
     <l n="521">Even good men turn banditti , and rejoice ,</l>
     <l n="522">Like Kouli-Kan , in plunder of the proud .</l>
     <l n="523">Though somewhat disconcerted , steady still</l>
     <l n="524">To the world 's cause , with half a face of joy ,</l>
     <l n="525">Lorenzo cries — “ Be , then , Ambition cast ;</l>
     <l n="526">Ambition 's dearer far stands unimpeach 'd , 526</l>
     <l n="527">Gay Pleasure ! proud Ambition is her slave ;</l>
     <l n="528">For her , he soars at great , and hazards ill ;</l>
     <l n="529">For her , he fights , and bleeds , or overcomes ;</l>
     <l n="530">And paves his way , with crowns , to reach her smile :</l>
     <l n="531">Who can resist her charms ?— or , should ? Lorenzo !</l>
     <l n="532">What mortal shall resist , where angels yield ?</l>
     <l n="533">Pleasure 's the mistress of ethereal powers ; 533</l>
     <l n="534">For her contend the rival gods above ;</l>
     <l n="535">Pleasure 's the mistress of the world below ;</l>
     <l n="536">And well it was for man , that Pleasure charms :</l>
     <l n="537">How would all stagnate , but for Pleasure 's ray !</l>
     <l n="538">How would the frozen stream of action cease !</l>
     <l n="539">What is the pulse of this so busy world ?</l>
     <l n="540">The love of pleasure : that , through every vein , 540</l>
     <l n="541">Throws motion , warmth ; and shuts out death from life .</l>
     <l n="542">Though various are the tempers of mankind ,</l>
     <l n="543">Pleasure 's gay family hold all in chains :</l>
     <l n="544">Some most affect the black ; and some , the fair ;</l>
     <l n="545">Some honest pleasure court ; and some , obscene .</l>
     <l n="546">Pleasures obscene are various , as the throng</l>
     <l n="547">Of passions , that can err in human hearts ;</l>
     <l n="548">Mistake their objects , or transgress their bounds .</l>
     <l n="549">Think you there 's but one whoredom ? Whoredom , all ,</l>
     <l n="550">But when our reason licenses delight . 550</l>
     <l n="551">Dost doubt , Lorenzo ? thou shalt doubt no more .</l>
     <l n="552">Thy father chides thy gallantries ; yet hugs</l>
     <l n="553">An ugly , common harlot , in the dark ;</l>
     <l n="554">A rank adulterer with others ’ gold !</l>
     <l n="555">And that hag , Vengeance , in a corner , charms .</l>
     <l n="556">Hatred her brothel has , as well as Love ,</l>
     <l n="557">Where horrid epicures debauch in blood .</l>
     <l n="558">Whate'er the motive , pleasure is the mark :</l>
     <l n="559">For her , the black assassin draws his sword ;</l>
     <l n="560">For her , dark statesmen trim their midnight lamp , 560</l>
     <l n="561">To which no single sacrifice may fall ;</l>
     <l n="562">For her , the saint abstains ; the miser starves ;</l>
     <l n="563">The Stoic proud , for Pleasure , pleasure scorn 'd ;</l>
     <l n="564">For her , Affliction 's daughters grief indulge ,</l>
     <l n="565">And find , or hope , a luxury in tears ;</l>
     <l n="566">For her , guilt , shame , toil , danger , we defy ;</l>
     <l n="567">And , with an aim voluptuous , rush on death .</l>
     <l n="568">Thus universal her despotic power !</l>
     <l n="569">And as her empire wide , her praise is just .</l>
     <l n="570">Patron of pleasure ! doater on delight ! 570</l>
     <l n="571">I am thy rival ; pleasure I profess ;</l>
     <l n="572">Pleasure the purpose of my gloomy song .</l>
     <l n="573">Pleasure is nought but virtue 's gayer name ;</l>
     <l n="574">I wrong her still , I rate her worth too low ;</l>
     <l n="575">Virtue the root , and pleasure is the flower ;</l>
     <l n="576">And honest Epicurus ’ foes were fools .</l>
     <l n="577">But this sounds harsh , and gives the wise offence ;</l>
     <l n="578">If o'erstrain ' d wisdom still retains the name .</l>
     <l n="579">How knits Austerity her cloudy brow ,</l>
     <l n="580">And blames , as bold , and hazardous , the praise 580</l>
     <l n="581">Of Pleasure , to mankind , unpraised , too dear !</l>
     <l n="582">Ye modern Stoics ! hear my soft reply ;</l>
     <l n="583">Their senses men will trust : we can n't impose ;</l>
     <l n="584">Or , if we could , is imposition right ?</l>
     <l n="585">Own honey sweet ; but , owning , add this sting ;</l>
     <l n="586">“ When mix 'd with poison , it is deadly too . ”</l>
     <l n="587">Truth never was indebted to a lie .</l>
     <l n="588">Is nought but virtue to be praised , as good ?</l>
     <l n="589">Why then is health preferr 'd before disease ?</l>
     <l n="590">What nature loves is good , without our leave . 590</l>
     <l n="591">And where no future drawback cries , “ Beware ! ”</l>
     <l n="592">Pleasure , though not from virtue , should prevail .</l>
     <l n="593">‘ Tis balm to life , and gratitude to Heaven ;</l>
     <l n="594">How cold our thanks for bounties unenjoy 'd ! 594</l>
     <l n="595">The love of pleasure is man 's eldest-born ,</l>
     <l n="596">Born in his cradle , living to his tomb ;</l>
     <l n="597">Wisdom , her younger sister , though more grave ,</l>
     <l n="598">Was meant to minister , and not to mar ,</l>
     <l n="599">Imperial Pleasure , queen of human hearts .</l>
     <l n="600">Lorenzo ! thou , her majesty 's renown 'd ,</l>
     <l n="601">Though uncoift , counsel , learned in the world !</l>
     <l n="602">Who think'st thyself a Murray ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 47 ]</span>with disdain 602</l>
     <l n="603">May'st look on me . Yet , my Demosthenes !</l>
     <l n="604">Canst thou plead Pleasure 's cause as well as I ?</l>
     <l n="605">Know'st thou her nature , purpose , parentage ?</l>
     <l n="606">Attend my song , and thou shalt know them all ;</l>
     <l n="607">And know thyself ; and know thyself to be</l>
     <l n="608">( Strange truth ! ) the most abstemious man alive .</l>
     <l n="609">Tell not Calista ; she will laugh thee dead ;</l>
     <l n="610">Or send thee to her hermitage with L ——. 610</l>
     <l n="611">Absurd presumption ! Thou who never knew'st</l>
     <l n="612">A serious thought ! shalt thou dare dream of joy ?</l>
     <l n="613">No man e'er found a happy life by chance ;</l>
     <l n="614">Or yawn 'd it into being with a wish ;</l>
     <l n="615">Or , with the snout of grovelling appetite ,</l>
     <l n="616">E'er smelt it out , and grubb 'd it from the dirt .</l>
     <l n="617">An art it is , and must be learn 'd ; and learn 'd</l>
     <l n="618">With unremitting effort , or be lost ;</l>
     <l n="619">And leaves us perfect blockheads , in our bliss .</l>
     <l n="620">The clouds may drop down titles and estates ; 620</l>
     <l n="621">Wealth may seek us ; but Wisdom must be sought ;</l>
     <l n="622">Sought before all ; but ( how unlike all else</l>
     <l n="623">We seek on earth ! ) ‘ tis never sought in vain .</l>
     <l n="624">First , Pleasure 's birth , rise , strength , and grandeur , see .</l>
     <l n="625">Brought forth by Wisdom , nursed by Discipline ,</l>
     <l n="626">By Patience taught , by Perseverance crown 'd ,</l>
     <l n="627">She rears her head majestic ; round her throne , 627</l>
     <l n="628">Erected in the bosom of the just ,</l>
     <l n="629">Each virtue , listed , forms her manly guard .</l>
     <l n="630">For what are virtues ? ( formidable name ! )</l>
     <l n="631">What , but the fountain , or defence , of joy ?</l>
     <l n="632">Why , then , commanded ? Need mankind commands ,</l>
     <l n="633">At once to merit , and to make , their bliss ?—</l>
     <l n="634">Great Legislator ! scarce so great , as kind ! 634</l>
     <l n="635">If men are rational , and love delight ,</l>
     <l n="636">Thy gracious law but flatters human choice ;</l>
     <l n="637">In the transgression lies the penalty ;</l>
     <l n="638">And they the most indulge , who most obey .</l>
     <l n="639">Of Pleasure , next , the final cause explore ;</l>
     <l n="640">Its mighty purpose , its important end . 640</l>
     <l n="641">Not to turn human brutal , but to build</l>
     <l n="642">Divine on human , Pleasure came from heaven .</l>
     <l n="643">In aid to Reason was the goddess sent ;</l>
     <l n="644">To call up all its strength by such a charm .</l>
     <l n="645">Pleasure , first , succours Virtue ; in return ,</l>
     <l n="646">Virtue gives Pleasure an eternal reign .</l>
     <l n="647">What , but the pleasure of food , friendship , faith ,</l>
     <l n="648">Supports life natural , civil , and divine ?</l>
     <l n="649">‘ Tis from the pleasure of repast , we live ;</l>
     <l n="650">‘ Tis from the pleasure of applause , we please ; 650</l>
     <l n="651">‘ Tis from the pleasure of belief , we pray</l>
     <l n="652">( All prayer would cease , if unbelieved the prize ):</l>
     <l n="653">It serves ourselves , our species , and our God ;</l>
     <l n="654">And to serve more , is past the sphere of man .</l>
     <l n="655">Glide , then , for ever , pleasure 's sacred stream !</l>
     <l n="656">Through Eden , as Euphrates ran , it runs ,</l>
     <l n="657">And fosters every growth of happy life ;</l>
     <l n="658">Makes a new Eden where it flows ;— but such</l>
     <l n="659">As must be lost , Lorenzo ! by thy fall .</l>
     <l n="660">“ What mean I by thy fall ? ” — Thou'lt shortly see ,</l>
     <l n="661">While Pleasure 's nature is at large display 'd ; 661</l>
     <l n="662">Already sung her origin , and ends .</l>
     <l n="663">Those glorious ends , by kind , or by degree ,</l>
     <l n="664">When Pleasure violates , ‘ tis then a vice ,</l>
     <l n="665">A vengeance too ; it hastens into pain .</l>
     <l n="666">From due refreshment , life , health , reason , joy ;</l>
     <l n="667">From wild excess , pain , grief , distraction , death ;</l>
     <l n="668">Heaven 's justice this proclaims , and that her love .</l>
     <l n="669">What greater evil can I wish my foe ,</l>
     <l n="670">Than his full draught of pleasure , from a cask 670</l>
     <l n="671">Unbroach 'd by just authority , ungauged</l>
     <l n="672">By temperance , by reason unrefined ?</l>
     <l n="673">A thousand demons lurk within the lee .</l>
     <l n="674">Heaven , others , and ourselves ! uninjured these ,</l>
     <l n="675">Drink deep ; the deeper , then , the more divine ;</l>
     <l n="676">Angels are angels , from indulgence there ;</l>
     <l n="677">‘ Tis unrepenting pleasure makes a god .</l>
     <l n="678">Dost think thyself a god from other joys ?</l>
     <l n="679">A victim rather ! shortly sure to bleed .</l>
     <l n="680">The wrong must mourn : can Heaven 's appointments fail ?</l>
     <l n="681">Can man outwit Omnipotence ? strike out 681</l>
     <l n="682">A self-wrought happiness unmeant by Him</l>
     <l n="683">Who made us , and the world we would enjoy ?</l>
     <l n="684">Who forms an instrument , ordains from whence</l>
     <l n="685">Its dissonance , or harmony , shall rise .</l>
     <l n="686">Heaven bid the soul this mortal frame inspire !</l>
     <l n="687">Bid virtue 's ray divine inspire the soul</l>
     <l n="688">With unprecarious flows of vital joy ;</l>
     <l n="689">And , without breathing , man as well might hope</l>
     <l n="690">For life , as , without piety , for peace . 690</l>
     <l n="691">“ Is virtue , then , and piety the same ? ” —</l>
     <l n="692">No ; piety is more ; ‘ tis virtue 's source ;</l>
     <l n="693">Mother of every worth , as that of joy .</l>
     <l n="694">Men of the world this doctrine ill digest ;</l>
     <l n="695">They smile at piety ; yet boast aloud 695</l>
     <l n="696">Good will to men ; nor know they strive to part</l>
     <l n="697">What Nature joins ; and thus confute themselves .</l>
     <l n="698">With piety begins all good on earth ;</l>
     <l n="699">‘ Tis the first-born of rationality .</l>
     <l n="700">Conscience , her first law broken , wounded lies ;</l>
     <l n="701">Enfeebled , lifeless , impotent to good ;</l>
     <l n="702">A feign 'd affection bounds her utmost power . 702</l>
     <l n="703">Some we can n't love , but for th ’ Almighty 's sake ;</l>
     <l n="704">A foe to God was ne'er true friend to man ;</l>
     <l n="705">Some sinister intent taints all he does ;</l>
     <l n="706">And , in his kindest actions , he 's unkind .</l>
     <l n="707">On piety , humanity is built ;</l>
     <l n="708">And , on humanity , much happiness ;</l>
     <l n="709">And yet still more on piety itself .</l>
     <l n="710">A soul in commerce with her God , is heaven ; 710</l>
     <l n="711">Feels not the tumults and the shocks of life ;</l>
     <l n="712">The whirls of passions , and the strokes of heart .</l>
     <l n="713">A Deity believed , is joy begun ;</l>
     <l n="714">A Deity adored , is joy advanced ;</l>
     <l n="715">A Deity beloved , is joy matured .</l>
     <l n="716">Each branch of piety delight inspires ;</l>
     <l n="717">Faith builds a bridge from this world to the next ,</l>
     <l n="718">O'er death 's dark gulf , and all its horror hides ;</l>
     <l n="719">Praise , the sweet exhalation of our joy ,</l>
     <l n="720">That joy exalts , and makes it sweeter still ; 720</l>
     <l n="721">Prayer ardent opens heaven , lets down a stream</l>
     <l n="722">Of glory on the consecrated hour</l>
     <l n="723">Of man , in audience with the Deity .</l>
     <l n="724">Who worships the great God , that instant joins</l>
     <l n="725">The first in heaven , and sets his foot on hell .</l>
     <l n="726">Lorenzo ! when wast thou at church before ?</l>
     <l n="727">Thou think'st the service long : but is it just ?</l>
     <l n="728">Though just , unwelcome : thou hadst rather tread</l>
     <l n="729">Unhallow 'd ground ; the Muse , to win thine ear , 729</l>
     <l n="730">Must take an air less solemn . She complies .</l>
     <l n="731">Good conscience ! at the sound the world retires ;</l>
     <l n="732">Verse disaffects it , and Lorenzo smiles :</l>
     <l n="733">Yet has she her seraglio full of charms ;</l>
     <l n="734">And such as age shall heighten , not impair .</l>
     <l n="735">Art thou dejected ? Is thy mind o'ercast ?</l>
     <l n="736">Amid her fair ones , thou the fairest choose ,</l>
     <l n="737">To chase thy gloom .— “ Go , fix some weighty truth ;</l>
     <l n="738">Chain down some passion ; do some generous good ;</l>
     <l n="739">Teach ignorance to see , or grief to smile ;</l>
     <l n="740">Correct thy friend ; befriend thy greatest foe ; 740</l>
     <l n="741">Or with warm heart , and confidence divine ,</l>
     <l n="742">Spring up , and lay strong hold on Him who made thee . ”</l>
     <l n="743">Thy gloom is scatter 'd , sprightly spirits flow ;</l>
     <l n="744">Though wither 'd is thy vine , and harp unstrung .</l>
     <l n="745">Dost call the bowl , the viol , and the dance ,</l>
     <l n="746">Loud mirth , mad laughter ? Wretched comforters !</l>
     <l n="747">Physicians ! more than half of thy disease .</l>
     <l n="748">Laughter , though never censured yet as sin</l>
     <l n="749">( Pardon a thought that only seems severe ) ,</l>
     <l n="750">Is half immoral : Is it much indulged ? 750</l>
     <l n="751">By venting spleen , or dissipating thought ,</l>
     <l n="752">It shows a scorner , or it makes a fool ;</l>
     <l n="753">And sins , as hurting others , or ourselves .</l>
     <l n="754">‘ Tis pride , or emptiness , applies the straw ,</l>
     <l n="755">That tickles little minds to mirth effuse ;</l>
     <l n="756">Of grief approaching , the portentous sign !</l>
     <l n="757">The house of laughter makes a house of woe .</l>
     <l n="758">A man triumphant is a monstrous sight ;</l>
     <l n="759">A man dejected is a sight as mean .</l>
     <l n="760">What cause for triumph , where such ills abound ? 760</l>
     <l n="761">What for dejection , where presides a Power ,</l>
     <l n="762">Who call 'd us into being to be bless 'd ?</l>
     <l n="763">So grieve , as conscious , grief may rise to joy ; 763</l>
     <l n="764">So joy , as conscious , joy to grief may fall .</l>
     <l n="765">Most true , a wise man never will be sad ;</l>
     <l n="766">But neither will sonorous , bubbling mirth ,</l>
     <l n="767">A shallow stream of happiness betray :</l>
     <l n="768">Too happy to be sportive , he 's serene .</l>
     <l n="769">Yet would'st thou laugh ( but at thy own expense ) ,</l>
     <l n="770">This counsel strange should I presume to give — 770</l>
     <l n="771">“ Retire , and read thy Bible , to be gay . ”</l>
     <l n="772">There truths abound of sovereign aid to peace ;</l>
     <l n="773">Ah ! do not prize them less , because inspired ,</l>
     <l n="774">As thou , and thine , are apt and proud to do .</l>
     <l n="775">If not inspired , that pregnant page had stood ,</l>
     <l n="776">Time 's treasure , and the wonder of the wise !</l>
     <l n="777">Thou think'st , perhaps , thy soul alone at stake ;</l>
     <l n="778">Alas !— should men mistake thee for a fool ;—</l>
     <l n="779">What man of taste for genius , wisdom , truth ,</l>
     <l n="780">Though tender of thy fame , could interpose ? 780</l>
     <l n="781">Believe me , sense here acts a double part ,</l>
     <l n="782">And the true critic is a Christian too .</l>
     <l n="783">But these , thou think'st , are gloomy paths to joy .—</l>
     <l n="784">True joy in sunshine ne'er was found at first ;</l>
     <l n="785">They , first , themselves offend , who greatly please ;</l>
     <l n="786">And travel only gives us sound repose .</l>
     <l n="787">Heaven sells all pleasure ; effort is the price ;</l>
     <l n="788">The joys of conquest , are the joys of man ;</l>
     <l n="789">And glory the victorious laurel spreads</l>
     <l n="790">O'er pleasure 's pure , perpetual , placid stream . 790</l>
     <l n="791">There is a time , when toil must be preferr 'd ,</l>
     <l n="792">Or joy , by mistimed fondness , is undone .</l>
     <l n="793">A man of pleasure , is a man of pains .</l>
     <l n="794">Thou wilt not take the trouble to be blest .</l>
     <l n="795">False joys , indeed , are born from want of thought ;</l>
     <l n="796">From thoughts full bent , and energy , the true ;</l>
     <l n="797">And that demands a mind in equal poise , 797</l>
     <l n="798">Remote from gloomy grief , and glaring joy .</l>
     <l n="799">Much joy not only speaks small happiness ,</l>
     <l n="800">But happiness that shortly must expire .</l>
     <l n="801">Can joy , unbottom 'd in reflection , stand ?</l>
     <l n="802">And , in a tempest , can reflection live ?</l>
     <l n="803">Can joy , like thine , secure itself an hour ?</l>
     <l n="804">Can joy , like thine , meet accident unshock 'd ? 804</l>
     <l n="805">Or ope the door to honest poverty ?</l>
     <l n="806">Or talk with threatening death , and not turn pale ?</l>
     <l n="807">In such a world , and such a nature , these</l>
     <l n="808">Are needful fundamentals of delight :</l>
     <l n="809">These fundamentals give delight indeed ;</l>
     <l n="810">Delight , pure , delicate , and durable ; 810</l>
     <l n="811">Delight , unshaken , masculine , divine ;</l>
     <l n="812">A constant , and a sound , but serious joy .</l>
     <l n="813">Is joy the daughter of severity ?</l>
     <l n="814">It is :— yet far my doctrine from severe .</l>
     <l n="815">“ Rejoice for ever : ” it becomes a man ;</l>
     <l n="816">Exalts , and sets him nearer to the gods .</l>
     <l n="817">“ Rejoice for ever ! ” Nature cries , “ Rejoice ! ”</l>
     <l n="818">And drinks to man , in her nectareous cup ,</l>
     <l n="819">Mix 'd up of delicates for every sense ;</l>
     <l n="820">To the great Founder of the bounteous feast , 820</l>
     <l n="821">Drinks glory , gratitude , eternal praise ;</l>
     <l n="822">And he that will not pledge her , is a churl .</l>
     <l n="823">Ill firmly to support , good fully taste ,</l>
     <l n="824">Is the whole science of felicity :</l>
     <l n="825">Yet sparing pledge : her bowl is not the best</l>
     <l n="826">Mankind can boast .— “ A rational repast ;</l>
     <l n="827">Exertion , vigilance , a mind in arms ,</l>
     <l n="828">A military discipline of thought ,</l>
     <l n="829">To foil temptation in the doubtful field ;</l>
     <l n="830">And ever-waking ardour for the right . ” 830</l>
     <l n="831">‘ Tis these , first give , then guard , a cheerful heart . 831</l>
     <l n="832">Nought that is right , think little ; well aware ,</l>
     <l n="833">What reason bids , God bids ; by His command</l>
     <l n="834">How aggrandized , the smallest thing we do !</l>
     <l n="835">Thus , nothing is insipid to the wise ;</l>
     <l n="836">To thee , insipid all , but what is mad ;</l>
     <l n="837">Joys season 'd high , and tasting strong of guilt .</l>
     <l n="838">“ Mad ! ( thou reply'st , with indignation fired ) ;</l>
     <l n="839">Of ancient sages proud to tread the steps ,</l>
     <l n="840">I follow Nature . ” — Follow Nature still , 840</l>
     <l n="841">But look it be thine own : is Conscience , then ,</l>
     <l n="842">No part of nature ? Is she not supreme ?</l>
     <l n="843">Thou regicide ! Oh , raise her from the dead !</l>
     <l n="844">Then , follow Nature ; and resemble God .</l>
     <l n="845">When , spite of Conscience , pleasure is pursued ,</l>
     <l n="846">Man 's nature is unnaturally pleased :</l>
     <l n="847">And what 's unnatural , is painful too</l>
     <l n="848">At intervals , and must disgust even thee !</l>
     <l n="849">The fact thou know'st ; but not , perhaps , the cause .</l>
     <l n="850">Virtue 's foundations with the world 's were laid ; 850</l>
     <l n="851">Heaven mix 'd her with our make , and twisted close</l>
     <l n="852">Her sacred interests with the strings of life .</l>
     <l n="853">Who breaks her awful mandate , shocks himself ,</l>
     <l n="854">His better self : and is it greater pain ,</l>
     <l n="855">Our soul should murmur , or our dust repine ?</l>
     <l n="856">And one , in their eternal war , must bleed .</l>
     <l n="857">If one must suffer , which should least be spared ?</l>
     <l n="858">The pains of mind surpass the pains of sense :</l>
     <l n="859">Ask , then , the gout , what torment is in guilt .</l>
     <l n="860">The joys of sense to mental joys are mean : 860</l>
     <l n="861">Sense on the present only feeds ; the soul</l>
     <l n="862">On past , and future , forages for joy .</l>
     <l n="863">‘ Tis hers , by retrospect , through time to range ;</l>
     <l n="864">And forward time 's great sequel to survey .</l>
     <l n="865">Could human courts take vengeance on the mind , 865</l>
     <l n="866">Axes might rust , and racks and gibbets fall :</l>
     <l n="867">Guard , then , thy mind , and leave the rest to fate .</l>
     <l n="868">Lorenzo ! wilt thou never be a man ?</l>
     <l n="869">The man is dead , who for the body lives ,</l>
     <l n="870">Lured , by the beating of his pulse , to list</l>
     <l n="871">With every lust , that wars against his peace ;</l>
     <l n="872">And sets him quite at variance with himself . 872</l>
     <l n="873">Thyself , first , know ; then love : a self there is</l>
     <l n="874">Of Virtue fond , that kindles at her charms .</l>
     <l n="875">A self there is , as fond of every vice ,</l>
     <l n="876">While every virtue wounds it to the heart :</l>
     <l n="877">Humility degrades it , Justice robs ,</l>
     <l n="878">Bless 'd Bounty beggars it , fair Truth betrays ,</l>
     <l n="879">And godlike Magnanimity destroys .</l>
     <l n="880">This self , when rival to the former , scorn ; 880</l>
     <l n="881">When not in competition , kindly treat ,</l>
     <l n="882">Defend it , feed it :— but when Virtue bids ,</l>
     <l n="883">Toss it , or to the fowls , or to the flames .</l>
     <l n="884">And why ? ‘ Tis love of pleasure bids thee bleed ;</l>
     <l n="885">Comply , or own self-love extinct , or blind .</l>
     <l n="886">For what is vice ? self-love in a mistake :</l>
     <l n="887">A poor blind merchant buying joys too dear .</l>
     <l n="888">And virtue , what ? ‘ tis self-love in her wits ,</l>
     <l n="889">Quite skilful in the market of delight .</l>
     <l n="890">Self-love 's good sense is love of that dread Power , 890</l>
     <l n="891">From whom herself , and all she can enjoy .</l>
     <l n="892">Other self-love is but disguised self-hate ;</l>
     <l n="893">More mortal than the malice of our foes ;</l>
     <l n="894">A self-hate , now , scarce felt ; then felt full sore ,</l>
     <l n="895">When being , cursed ; extinction , loud implored ;</l>
     <l n="896">And every thing preferr 'd to what we are .</l>
     <l n="897">Yet this self-love Lorenzo makes his choice ;</l>
     <l n="898">And , in this choice triumphant , boasts of joy .</l>
     <l n="899">How is his want of happiness betray 'd , 899</l>
     <l n="900">By disaffection to the present hour !</l>
     <l n="901">Imagination wanders far afield :</l>
     <l n="902">The future pleases : why ? the present pains .—</l>
     <l n="903">“ But that 's a secret . ” Yes , which all men know ;</l>
     <l n="904">And know from thee , discover 'd unawares .</l>
     <l n="905">Thy ceaseless agitation , restless roll</l>
     <l n="906">From cheat to cheat , impatient of a pause ;</l>
     <l n="907">What is it ?— ‘ tis the cradle of the soul ,</l>
     <l n="908">From Instinct sent , to rock her in disease ,</l>
     <l n="909">Which her physician , Reason , will not cure .</l>
     <l n="910">A poor expedient ! yet thy best ; and while 910</l>
     <l n="911">It mitigates thy pain , it owns it too .</l>
     <l n="912">Such are Lorenzo 's wretched remedies !</l>
     <l n="913">The weak have remedies ; the wise have joys .</l>
     <l n="914">Superior wisdom is superior bliss .</l>
     <l n="915">And what sure mark distinguishes the wise ?</l>
     <l n="916">Consistent wisdom ever wills the same ;</l>
     <l n="917">Thy fickle wish is ever on the wing .</l>
     <l n="918">Sick of herself , is Folly 's character ,</l>
     <l n="919">As Wisdom 's is , a modest self-applause .</l>
     <l n="920">A change of evils is thy good supreme ; 920</l>
     <l n="921">Nor , but in motion , canst thou find thy rest .</l>
     <l n="922">Man 's greatest strength is shown in standing still .</l>
     <l n="923">The first sure symptom of a mind in health ,</l>
     <l n="924">Is rest of heart , and pleasure felt at home .</l>
     <l n="925">False pleasure from abroad her joys imports ;</l>
     <l n="926">Rich from within , and self-sustain 'd , the true .</l>
     <l n="927">The true is fix 'd , and solid as a rock ;</l>
     <l n="928">Slippery the false , and tossing , as the wave .</l>
     <l n="929">This , a wild wanderer on earth , like Cain ;</l>

     <l n="933">Smit with her own condition ; and the more</l>
     <l n="934">Intense she gazes , still it charms the more .</l>
     <l n="935">No man is happy , till he thinks , on earth</l>
     <l n="936">There breathes not a more happy than himself :</l>
     <l n="937">Then envy dies , and love o'erflows on all ;</l>
     <l n="938">And love o'erflowing makes an angel here .</l>
     <l n="939">Such angels , all , entitled to repose</l>
     <l n="940">On Him who governs fate . Though tempest frowns , 940</l>
     <l n="941">Though nature shakes , how soft to lean on Heaven !</l>
     <l n="942">To lean on Him , on whom archangels lean !</l>
     <l n="943">With inward eyes , and silent as the grave ,</l>
     <l n="944">They stand , collecting every beam of thought ,</l>
     <l n="945">Till their hearts kindle with divine delight :</l>
     <l n="946">For all their thoughts , like angels , seen of old</l>
     <l n="947">In Israel 's dream , come from , and go to , heaven .</l>
     <l n="948">Hence are they studious of sequester 'd scenes ;</l>
     <l n="949">While noise , and dissipation , comfort thee .</l>
     <l n="950">Were all men happy , revellings would cease , 950</l>
     <l n="951">That opiate for inquietude within .</l>
     <l n="952">Lorenzo ! never man was truly blest ,</l>
     <l n="953">But it composed , and gave him such a cast ,</l>
     <l n="954">As folly might mistake for want of joy .</l>
     <l n="955">A cast , unlike the triumph of the proud ;</l>
     <l n="956">A modest aspect , and a smile at heart .</l>
     <l n="957">O for a joy from thy Philander 's spring !</l>
     <l n="958">A spring perennial , rising in the breast ,</l>
     <l n="959">And permanent , as pure ! no turbid stream</l>
     <l n="960">Of rapturous exultation , swelling high ; 960</l>
     <l n="961">Which , like land floods , impetuous pour a while ,</l>

     <l n="965">Vain are all sudden sallies of delight ;</l>
     <l n="966">Convulsions of a weak , distemper 'd joy . 966</l>
     <l n="967">Joy 's a fix 'd state ; a tenure , not a start .</l>
     <l n="968">Bliss there is none , but unprecarious bliss :</l>

     <l n="1046">In this our day of proof , our land of hope ,</l>

     <l n="1048">Clouds , that obscure his sublunary day ,</l>
     <l n="1049">But never conquer : even the best must own ,</l>
     <l n="1050">Patience , and resignation , are the pillars 1050</l>
     <l n="1051">Of human peace on earth . The pillars , these :</l>
     <l n="1052">But those of Seth not more remote from thee ,</l>

     <l n="1059">The glorious dawn of our eternal day .</l>
     <l n="1060">“ This ( says Lorenzo ) is a fair harangue : 1060</l>
     <l n="1061">But can harangues blow back strong nature 's stream ;</l>
     <l n="1062">Or stem the tide Heaven pushes through our veins ,</l>

     <l n="1069">Above ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 50 ]</span>Lorenzo saw the man of earth ,</l>
     <l n="1070">The mortal man ; and wretched was the sight .</l>
     <l n="1071">To balance that , to comfort , and exalt ,</l>
     <l n="1072">Now see the man immortal : him , I mean ,</l>
     <l n="1073">Who lives as such ; whose heart , full bent on heaven ,</l>
     <l n="1074">Leans all that way , his bias to the stars .</l>

     <l n="1079">Some angel guide my pencil , while I draw ,</l>

     <l n="1084">Behold him seated on a mount serene ,</l>
     <l n="1085">Above the fogs of sense , and passion 's storm ;</l>
     <l n="1086">All the black cares , and tumults , of this life ,</l>
     <l n="1087">Like harmless thunders , breaking at his feet ,</l>
     <l n="1088">Excite his pity , not impair his peace .</l>
     <l n="1089">Earth 's genuine sons , the sceptred , and the slave ,</l>

     <l n="1109">What makes them only smile , makes him adore .</l>
     <l n="1110">Where they see mountains , he but atoms sees ; 1110</l>
     <l n="1111">An empire , in his balance , weighs a grain .</l>
     <l n="1112">They things terrestrial worship , as divine :</l>
     <l n="1113">His hopes immortal blow them by , as dust ,</l>
     <l n="1114">That dims his sight , and shortens his survey ,</l>
     <l n="1115">Which longs , in infinite , to lose all bound .</l>
     <l n="1116">Titles and honours ( if they prove his fate )</l>
     <l n="1117">He lays aside to find his dignity ;</l>
     <l n="1118">No dignity they find in aught besides .</l>
     <l n="1119">They triumph in externals ( which conceal</l>
     <l n="1120">Man 's real glory ) , proud of an eclipse . 1120</l>
     <l n="1121">Himself too much he prizes to be proud ,</l>
     <l n="1122">And nothing thinks so great in man , as man .</l>
     <l n="1123">Too dear he holds his interest , to neglect</l>
     <l n="1124">Another 's welfare , or his right invade ;</l>
     <l n="1125">Their interest , like a lion , lives on prey .</l>
     <l n="1126">They kindle at the shadow of a wrong :</l>
     <l n="1127">Wrong he sustains with temper , looks on heaven ,</l>
     <l n="1128">Nor stoops to think his injurer his foe ;</l>
     <l n="1129">Nought , but what wounds his virtue , wounds his peace .</l>
     <l n="1130">A cover 'd heart their character defends ; 1130</l>
     <l n="1131">A cover 'd heart denies him half his praise .</l>
     <l n="1132">With nakedness his innocence agrees ;</l>
     <l n="1133">While their broad foliage testifies their fall :</l>
     <l n="1134">Their no joys end , where his full feast begins ; 1134</l>
     <l n="1135">His joys create , theirs murder , future bliss .</l>
     <l n="1136">To triumph in existence , his alone ;</l>
     <l n="1137">And his alone , triumphantly to think</l>
     <l n="1138">His true existence is not yet begun .</l>
     <l n="1139">His glorious course was , yesterday , complete ;</l>
     <l n="1140">Death , then , was welcome ; yet life still is sweet .</l>
     <l n="1141">But nothing charms Lorenzo , like the firm ,</l>
     <l n="1142">Undaunted breast — and whose is that high praise ? 1142</l>
     <l n="1143">They yield to pleasure , though they danger brave ,</l>
     <l n="1144">And show no fortitude , but in the field ;</l>
     <l n="1145">If there they show it , ‘ tis for glory shown ;</l>
     <l n="1146">Nor will that cordial always man their hearts .</l>
     <l n="1147">A cordial his sustains , that cannot fail ;</l>
     <l n="1148">By pleasure unsubdued , unbroke by pain ,</l>
     <l n="1149">He shares in that Omnipotence he trusts .</l>
     <l n="1150">All-bearing , all-attempting , till he falls ; 1150</l>
     <l n="1151">And when he falls , writes VICI on his shield .</l>
     <l n="1152">From magnanimity , all fear above ;</l>
     <l n="1153">From nobler recompence , above applause ;</l>
     <l n="1154">Which owes to man 's short outlook all its charms .</l>
     <l n="1155">Backward to credit what he never felt ,</l>
     <l n="1156">Lorenzo cries ,— “ Where shines this miracle ?</l>
     <l n="1157">From what root rises this immortal man ? ”</l>
     <l n="1158">A root that grows not in Lorenzo 's ground ;</l>
     <l n="1159">The root dissect , nor wonder at the flower .</l>
     <l n="1160">He follows nature ( not like thee ) and shows us 1160</l>
     <l n="1161">An uninverted system of a man .</l>
     <l n="1162">His appetite wears Reason 's golden chain ,</l>
     <l n="1163">And finds , in due restraint , its luxury .</l>
     <l n="1164">His passion , like an eagle well reclaim 'd ,</l>
     <l n="1165">Is taught to fly at nought , but infinite .</l>
     <l n="1166">Patient his hope , unanxious is his care ,</l>
     <l n="1167">His caution fearless , and his grief ( if grief</l>
     <l n="1168">The gods ordain ) a stranger to despair . 1168</l>
     <l n="1169">And why ?— because affection , more than meet ,</l>
     <l n="1170">His wisdom leaves not disengaged from heaven .</l>
     <l n="1171">Those secondary goods that smile on earth ,</l>
     <l n="1172">He , loving in proportion , loves in peace .</l>
     <l n="1173">They most the world enjoy , who least admire .</l>
     <l n="1174">His understanding ‘ scapes the common cloud</l>
     <l n="1175">Of fumes , arising from a boiling breast .</l>
     <l n="1176">His head is clear , because his heart is cool ,</l>
     <l n="1177">By worldly competitions uninflamed .</l>
     <l n="1178">The moderate movements of his soul admit</l>
     <l n="1179">Distinct ideas , and matured debate ,</l>
     <l n="1180">An eye impartial , and an even scale ; 1180</l>
     <l n="1181">Whence judgment sound , and unrepenting choice .</l>
     <l n="1182">Thus , in a double sense , the good are wise ;</l>
     <l n="1183">On its own dunghill , wiser than the world .</l>
     <l n="1184">What , then , the world ? It must be doubly weak ;</l>
     <l n="1185">Strange truth ! as soon would they believe their creed .</l>
     <l n="1186">Yet thus it is ; nor otherwise can be ;</l>
     <l n="1187">So far from aught romantic , what I sing .</l>
     <l n="1188">Bliss has no being , virtue has no strength ,</l>
     <l n="1189">But from the prospect of immortal life .</l>
     <l n="1190">Who think earth all , or ( what weighs just the same ) 1190</l>
     <l n="1191">Who care no farther , must prize what it yields ;</l>
     <l n="1192">Fond of its fancies , proud of its parades .</l>
     <l n="1193">Who thinks earth nothing , can n't its charms admire ;</l>
     <l n="1194">He can n't a foe , though most malignant , hate ,</l>
     <l n="1195">Because that hate would prove his greater foe .</l>
     <l n="1196">‘ Tis hard for them ( yet who so loudly boast</l>
     <l n="1197">Good-will to men ? ) to love their dearest friend ;</l>
     <l n="1198">For may not he invade their good supreme ,</l>
     <l n="1199">Where the least jealousy turns love to gall ?</l>
     <l n="1200">All shines to them , that for a season shines . 1200</l>
     <l n="1201">Each act , each thought , he questions , “ What its weight ,</l>
     <l n="1202">Its colour what , a thousand ages hence ? ” — 1202</l>
     <l n="1203">And what it there appears , he deems it now .</l>
     <l n="1204">Hence , pure are the recesses of his soul .</l>
     <l n="1205">The godlike man has nothing to conceal .</l>
     <l n="1206">His virtue , constitutionally deep ,</l>
     <l n="1207">Has habit 's firmness , and affection 's flame ;</l>
     <l n="1208">Angels , allied , descend to feed the fire ;</l>
     <l n="1209">And Death , which others slays , makes him a god .</l>
     <l n="1210">And now , Lorenzo ! bigot of this world ! 1210</l>
     <l n="1211">Wont to disdain poor bigots caught by Heaven !</l>
     <l n="1212">Stand by thy scorn , and be reduced to nought :</l>
     <l n="1213">For what art thou ?— Thou boaster ! while thy glare ,</l>
     <l n="1214">Thy gaudy grandeur , and mere worldly worth ,</l>
     <l n="1215">Like a broad mist , at distance , strikes us most ;</l>
     <l n="1216">And , like a mist , is nothing when at hand ;</l>
     <l n="1217">His merit , like a mountain , on approach ,</l>
     <l n="1218">Swells more , and rises nearer to the skies ,</l>
     <l n="1219">By promise now , and , by possession , soon ,</l>
     <l n="1220">( Too soon , too much , it cannot be ) his own . 1220</l>
     <l n="1221">From this thy just annihilation rise ,</l>
     <l n="1222">Lorenzo ! rise to something , by reply .</l>
     <l n="1223">The world , thy client , listens , and expects ;</l>
     <l n="1224">And longs to crown thee with immortal praise .</l>
     <l n="1225">Canst thou be silent ? No ; for Wit is thine ;</l>
     <l n="1226">And Wit talks most , when least she has to say ,</l>
     <l n="1227">And Reason interrupts not her career .</l>
     <l n="1228">She 'll say — that mists above the mountains rise ;</l>
     <l n="1229">And , with a thousand pleasantries , amuse ;</l>
     <l n="1230">She 'll sparkle , puzzle , flutter , raise a dust , 1230</l>
     <l n="1231">And fly conviction , in the dust she raised .</l>
     <l n="1232">Wit , how delicious to man 's dainty taste !</l>
     <l n="1233">‘ Tis precious , as the vehicle of sense ;</l>
     <l n="1234">But , as its substitute , a dire disease .</l>
     <l n="1235">Pernicious talent ! flatter 'd by the world ,</l>
     <l n="1236">By the blind world , which thinks the talent rare . 1236</l>
     <l n="1237">Wisdom is rare , Lorenzo ! wit abounds ;</l>
     <l n="1238">Passion can give it ; sometimes wine inspires</l>
     <l n="1239">The lucky flash ; and madness rarely fails .</l>
     <l n="1240">Whatever cause the spirit strongly stirs ,</l>
     <l n="1241">Confers the bays , and rivals thy renown .</l>
     <l n="1242">For thy renown , ‘ twere well was this the worst ;</l>
     <l n="1243">Chance often hits it ; and , to pique thee more , 1243</l>
     <l n="1244">See Dulness , blundering on vivacities ,</l>
     <l n="1245">Shakes her sage head at the calamity ,</l>
     <l n="1246">Which has exposed , and let her down to thee .</l>
     <l n="1247">But Wisdom , awful Wisdom ! which inspects ,</l>
     <l n="1248">Discerns , compares , weighs , separates , infers ,</l>
     <l n="1249">Seizes the right , and holds it to the last ;</l>
     <l n="1250">How rare ! In senates , synods , sought in vain ; 1250</l>
     <l n="1251">Or if there found , ‘ tis sacred to the few ;</l>
     <l n="1252">While a lewd prostitute to multitudes ,</l>
     <l n="1253">Frequent , as fatal , Wit : in civil life ,</l>
     <l n="1254">Wit makes an enterpriser ; Sense , a man .</l>
     <l n="1255">Wit hates authority ; commotion loves ,</l>
     <l n="1256">And thinks herself the lightning of the storm .</l>
     <l n="1257">In states , ‘ tis dangerous ; in religion , death :</l>
     <l n="1258">Shall Wit turn Christian , when the dull believe ?</l>
     <l n="1259">Sense is our helmet , wit is but the plume ;</l>
     <l n="1260">The plume exposes , ‘ tis our helmet saves . 1260</l>
     <l n="1261">Sense is the diamond , weighty , solid , sound ;</l>
     <l n="1262">When cut by wit , it casts a brighter beam ;</l>
     <l n="1263">Yet , wit apart , it is a diamond still .</l>
     <l n="1264">Wit , widow 'd of good sense , is worse than nought ;</l>
     <l n="1265">It hoists more sail to run against a rock .</l>
     <l n="1266">Thus , a half-Chesterfield is quite a fool ;</l>
     <l n="1267">Whom dull fools scorn , and bless their want of wit .</l>
     <l n="1268">How ruinous the rock I warn thee shun ,</l>
     <l n="1269">Where syrens sit , to sing thee to thy fate !</l>
     <l n="1270">A joy , in which our reason bears no part , 1270</l>
     <l n="1271">Is but a sorrow , tickling , ere it stings .</l>
     <l n="1272">Let not the cooings of the world allure thee ;</l>
     <l n="1273">Which of her lovers ever found her true ?</l>
     <l n="1274">Happy ! of this bad world who little know ?—</l>
     <l n="1275">And yet , we much must know her , to be safe ;</l>
     <l n="1276">To know the world , not love her , is thy point ;</l>
     <l n="1277">She gives but little , nor that little , long .</l>
     <l n="1278">There is , I grant , a triumph of the pulse ;</l>
     <l n="1279">A dance of spirits , a mere froth of joy ,</l>
     <l n="1280">Our thoughtless agitation 's idle child , 1280</l>
     <l n="1281">That mantles high , that sparkles , and expires ,</l>
     <l n="1282">Leaving the soul more vapid than before .</l>
     <l n="1283">An animal ovation ! such as holds</l>
     <l n="1284">No commerce with our reason , but subsists</l>
     <l n="1285">On juices , through the well-toned tubes , well strain 'd ;</l>
     <l n="1286">A nice machine ! scarce ever tuned aright ;</l>
     <l n="1287">And when it jars — thy syrens sing no more ,</l>
     <l n="1288">Thy dance is done ; the demi-god is thrown</l>
     <l n="1289">( Short apotheosis ! ) beneath the man ,</l>
     <l n="1290">In coward gloom immersed , or fell despair . 1290</l>
     <l n="1291">Art thou yet dull enough despair to dread ,</l>
     <l n="1292">And startle at destruction ? If thou art ,</l>

     <l n="1313">Half ignorance , their mirth ; and half , a lie ; 1313</l>
     <l n="1314">To cheat the world , and cheat themselves , they smile .</l>
     <l n="1315">Hard either task ! The most abandon 'd own ,</l>
     <l n="1316">That others , if abandon 'd , are undone :</l>
     <l n="1317">Then , for themselves , the moment Reason wakes</l>
     <l n="1318">( And Providence denies it long repose ) ,</l>
     <l n="1319">O how laborious is their gaiety !</l>
     <l n="1320">They scarce can swallow their ebullient spleen , 1320</l>
     <l n="1321">Scarce muster patience to support the farce ,</l>
     <l n="1322">And pump sad laughter till the curtain falls .</l>
     <l n="1323">Scarce , did I say ? Some cannot sit it out ;</l>
     <l n="1324">Oft their own daring hands the curtain draw ,</l>
     <l n="1325">And show us what their joy , by their despair .</l>
     <l n="1326">The clotted hair ! gored breast ! blaspheming eye !</l>
     <l n="1327">Its impious fury still alive in death !</l>
     <l n="1328">Shut , shut the shocking scene .— But Heaven denies</l>
     <l n="1329">A cover to such guilt ; and so should man .</l>
     <l n="1330">Look round , Lorenzo ! see the reeking blade , 1330</l>
     <l n="1331">Th ’ envenom 'd phial , and the fatal ball ;</l>
     <l n="1332">The strangling cord , and suffocating stream ;</l>
     <l n="1333">The loathsome rottenness , and foul decays</l>
     <l n="1334">From raging riot ( slower suicides ! )</l>
     <l n="1335">And pride in these , more execrable still !</l>
     <l n="1336">How horrid all to thought !— but horrors , these ,</l>
     <l n="1337">That vouch the truth ; and aid my feeble song .</l>
     <l n="1338">From vice , sense , fancy , no man can be blest : 1338</l>
     <l n="1339">Bliss is too great , to lodge within an hour :</l>
     <l n="1340">When an immortal being aims at bliss ,</l>
     <l n="1341">Duration is essential to the name .</l>
     <l n="1342">O for a joy from reason ! joy from that ,</l>
     <l n="1343">Which makes man Man ; and , exercised aright ,</l>
     <l n="1344">Will make him more : a bounteous joy ! that gives</l>
     <l n="1345">And promises ; that weaves , with art divine ,</l>
     <l n="1346">The richest prospect into present peace :</l>
     <l n="1347">A joy ambitious ! joy in common held</l>
     <l n="1348">With thrones ethereal , and their greater far ;</l>
     <l n="1349">A joy high privileged from chance , time , death !</l>
     <l n="1350">A joy , which death shall double , judgment crown ! 1350</l>
     <l n="1351">Crown 'd higher , and still higher , at each stage ,</l>
     <l n="1352">Through bless 'd eternity 's long day ; yet still ,</l>
     <l n="1353">Not more remote from sorrow , than from Him ,</l>
     <l n="1354">Whose lavish hand , whose love stupendous , pours</l>
     <l n="1355">So much of Deity on guilty dust .</l>
     <l n="1356">There , O my Lucia ! may I meet thee there ,</l>
     <l n="1357">Where not thy presence can improve my bliss !</l>
     <l n="1358">Affects not this the sages of the world ?</l>
     <l n="1359">Can nought affect them , but what fools them too ?</l>
     <l n="1360">Eternity , depending on an hour , 1360</l>
     <l n="1361">Makes serious thought man 's wisdom , joy , and praise ,</l>
     <l n="1362">Nor need you blush ( though sometimes your designs</l>
     <l n="1363">May shun the light ) at your designs on heaven :</l>
     <l n="1364">Sole point ! where over-bashful is your blame .</l>
     <l n="1365">Are you not wise ?— You know you are : yet hear</l>
     <l n="1366">One truth , amid your numerous schemes , mislaid ,</l>
     <l n="1367">Or overlook 'd , or thrown aside , if seen ;</l>
     <l n="1368">“ Our schemes to plan by this world , or the next ,</l>
     <l n="1369">Is the sole difference between wise and fool . ”</l>
     <l n="1370">All worthy men will weigh you in this scale ; 1370</l>
     <l n="1371">What wonder then , if they pronounce you light ? 1371</l>
     <l n="1372">Is their esteem alone not worth your care ?</l>
     <l n="1373">Accept my simple scheme of common sense :</l>
     <l n="1374">Thus , save your fame , and make two worlds your own .</l>
     <l n="1375">The world replies not ;— but the world persists ;</l>
     <l n="1376">And puts the cause off to the longest day ,</l>
     <l n="1377">Planning evasions for the day of doom .</l>
     <l n="1378">So far , at that re-hearing , from redress ,</l>
     <l n="1379">They then turn witnesses against themselves ;</l>
     <l n="1380">Hear that , Lorenzo ! nor be wise to-morrow . 1380</l>
     <l n="1381">Haste , haste ! a man , by nature , is in haste ;</l>
     <l n="1382">For who shall answer for another hour ?</l>
     <l n="1383">‘ Tis highly prudent , to make one sure friend ;</l>
     <l n="1384">And that thou canst not do , this side the skies .</l>
     <l n="1385">Ye sons of earth ! ( nor willing to be more ! )</l>
     <l n="1386">Since verse you think from priestcraft somewhat free ,</l>
     <l n="1387">Thus , in an age so gay , the Muse plain truths</l>
     <l n="1388">( Truths , which , at church , you might have heard in prose )</l>
     <l n="1389">Has ventured into light ; well pleased the verse</l>
     <l n="1390">Should be forgot , if you the truths retain ; 1390</l>
     <l n="1391">And crown her with your welfare , not your praise .</l>
     <l n="1392">But praise she need not fear : I see my fate ;</l>
     <l n="1393">And headlong leap , like Curtius , down the gulf .</l>
     <l n="1394">Since many an ample volume , mighty tome ,</l>
     <l n="1395">Must die ; and die unwept ; O thou minute</l>
     <l n="1396">Devoted page ! go forth among thy foes ;</l>
     <l n="1397">Go , nobly proud of martyrdom for truth ,</l>
     <l n="1398">And die a double death : mankind incensed ,</l>
     <l n="1399">Denies thee long to live : nor shalt thou rest ,</l>
     <l n="1400">When thou art dead ; in Stygian shades arraign 'd 1400</l>
     <l n="1401">By Lucifer , as traitor to his throne ;</l>
     <l n="1402">And bold blasphemer of his friend ,— the World ;</l>
     <l n="1403">The World , whose legions cost him slender pay ,</l>
     <l n="1404">And volunteers around his banner swarm ; 1404</l>
     <l n="1405">Prudent , as Prussia ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 51 ]</span>in her zeal for Gaul .</l>
     <l n="1406">“ Are all , then , fools ? ” Lorenzo cries .— Yes , all ,</l>
     <l n="1407">But such as hold this doctrine ( new to thee ) ;</l>
     <l n="1408">“ The mother of true wisdom is the will ; ”</l>
     <l n="1409">The noblest intellect , a fool without it .</l>
     <l n="1410">World-wisdom much has done , and more may do , 1410</l>
     <l n="1411">In arts and sciences , in wars , and peace :</l>
     <l n="1412">But art and science , like thy wealth , will leave thee ,</l>
     <l n="1413">And make thee twice a beggar at thy death .</l>
     <l n="1414">This is the most indulgence can afford ;—</l>
     <l n="1415">“ Thy wisdom all can do , but — make thee wise . ”</l>
     <l n="1416">Nor think this censure is severe on thee ;</l>
     <l n="1417">Satan , thy master , I dare call a dunce . 1417</l>

    <head>NIGHT NINTH .</head>
    <head>THE CONSOLATION .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">As when a traveller , a long day past</l>
     <l n="2">In painful search of what he cannot find ,</l>
     <l n="3">At night 's approach , content with the next cot ,</l>
     <l n="4">There ruminates , a while , his labour lost ;</l>
     <l n="5">Then cheers his heart with what his fate affords ,</l>
     <l n="6">And chants his sonnet to deceive the time ,</l>
     <l n="7">Till the due season calls him to repose :</l>
     <l n="8">Thus I , long-travell 'd in the ways of men ,</l>
     <l n="9">And dancing , with the rest , the giddy maze ,</l>
     <l n="10">Where Disappointment smiles at Hope 's career ; 10</l>
     <l n="11">Warn 'd by the languor of life 's evening ray ,</l>
     <l n="12">At length have housed me in an humble shed ;</l>
     <l n="13">Where , future wandering banish 'd from my thought ,</l>
     <l n="14">And waiting , patient , the sweet hour of rest ,</l>
     <l n="15">I chase the moments with a serious song .</l>
     <l n="16">Song soothes our pains ; and age has pains to soothe .</l>
     <l n="17">When age , care , crime , and friends embraced at heart ,</l>
     <l n="18">Torn from my bleeding breast , and death 's dark shade ,</l>
     <l n="19">Which hovers o'er me , quench th ’ ethereal fire ;</l>
     <l n="20">Canst thou , O Night ! indulge one labour more ? 20</l>
     <l n="21">One labour more indulge ! then sleep , my strain ! 21</l>
     <l n="22">Till , haply , waked by Raphael 's golden lyre ,</l>
     <l n="23">Where night , death , age , care , crime , and sorrow , cease ;</l>
     <l n="24">To bear a part in everlasting lays ;</l>
     <l n="25">Though far , far higher set , in aim , I trust ,</l>
     <l n="26">Symphonious to this humble prelude here .</l>
     <l n="27">Has not the Muse asserted pleasures pure ,</l>
     <l n="28">Like those above ; exploding other joys ?</l>
     <l n="29">Weigh what was urged , Lorenzo ! fairly weigh ;</l>
     <l n="30">And tell me , hast thou cause to triumph still ? 30</l>
     <l n="31">I think , thou wilt forbear a boast so bold .</l>
     <l n="32">But if , beneath the favour of mistake ,</l>
     <l n="33">Thy smile 's sincere ; not more sincere can be</l>
     <l n="34">Lorenzo 's smile , than my compassion for him .</l>
     <l n="35">The sick in body call for aid ; the sick</l>
     <l n="36">In mind are covetous of more disease ;</l>
     <l n="37">And when at worst , they dream themselves quite well .</l>
     <l n="38">To know ourselves diseased , is half our cure .</l>
     <l n="39">When Nature 's blush by Custom is wiped off ,</l>
     <l n="40">And Conscience , deaden 'd by repeated strokes , 40</l>
     <l n="41">Has into manners naturalized our crimes ;</l>
     <l n="42">The curse of curses is , our curse to love ;</l>
     <l n="43">To triumph in the blackness of our guilt</l>
     <l n="44">( As Indians glory in the deepest jet ) ,</l>
     <l n="45">And throw aside our senses with our peace .</l>
     <l n="46">But grant no guilt , no shame , no least alloy ;</l>
     <l n="47">Grant joy and glory quite unsullied shone ;</l>
     <l n="48">Yet , still , it ill deserves Lorenzo 's heart .</l>
     <l n="49">No joy , no glory , glitters in thy sight ,</l>
     <l n="50">But , through the thin partition of an hour , 50</l>
     <l n="51">I see its sables wove by destiny ;</l>
     <l n="52">And that in sorrow buried ; this , in shame ;</l>
     <l n="53">While howling furies wring the doleful knell ;</l>
     <l n="54">And Conscience , now so soft thou scarce canst hear 54</l>
     <l n="55">Her whisper , echoes her eternal peal .</l>
     <l n="56">Where , the prime actors of the last year 's scene ;</l>
     <l n="57">Their port so proud , their buskin , and their plume ?</l>
     <l n="58">How many sleep , who kept the world awake</l>
     <l n="59">With lustre , and with noise ! has Death proclaim 'd</l>
     <l n="60">A truce , and hung his sated lance on high ?</l>
     <l n="61">‘ Tis brandish 'd still ; nor shall the present year</l>
     <l n="62">Be more tenacious of her human leaf , 62</l>
     <l n="63">Or spread of feeble life a thinner fall .</l>
     <l n="64">But needless monuments to wake the thought ;</l>
     <l n="65">Life 's gayest scenes speak man 's mortality ;</l>
     <l n="66">Though in a style more florid , full as plain ,</l>
     <l n="67">As mausoleums , pyramids , and tombs .</l>
     <l n="68">What are our noblest ornaments , but deaths</l>
     <l n="69">Turn 'd flatterers of life , in paint , or marble ,</l>
     <l n="70">The well-stain 'd canvas , or the featured stone ? 70</l>
     <l n="71">Our fathers grace , or rather haunt , the scene .</l>
     <l n="72">Joy peoples her pavilion from the dead .</l>
     <l n="73">“ Profess 'd diversions ! cannot these escape ? ”</l>
     <l n="74">Far from it : these present us with a shroud ;</l>
     <l n="75">And talk of death , like garlands o'er a grave .</l>
     <l n="76">As some bold plunderers , for buried wealth ,</l>
     <l n="77">We ransack tombs for pastime ; from the dust</l>
     <l n="78">Call up the sleeping hero ; bid him tread</l>
     <l n="79">The scene for our amusement : how like gods</l>
     <l n="80">We sit ; and , wrapt in immortality , 80</l>
     <l n="81">Shed generous tears on wretches born to die ;</l>
     <l n="82">Their fate deploring , to forget our own !</l>
     <l n="83">What all the pomps and triumphs of our lives ,</l>
     <l n="84">But legacies in blossom ? Our lean soil ,</l>
     <l n="85">Luxuriant grown , and rank in vanities ,</l>
     <l n="86">From friends interr 'd beneath ; a rich manure !</l>
     <l n="87">Like other worms , we banquet on the dead ;</l>
     <l n="88">Like other worms , shall we crawl on , nor know 88</l>
     <l n="89">Our present frailties , or approaching fate ?</l>
     <l n="90">Lorenzo ! such the glories of the world !</l>
     <l n="91">What is the world itself ? thy world — a grave .</l>
     <l n="92">Where is the dust that has not been alive ?</l>
     <l n="93">The spade , the plough , disturb our ancestors ;</l>
     <l n="94">From human mould we reap our daily bread .</l>
     <l n="95">The globe around earth 's hollow surface shakes ,</l>
     <l n="96">And is the ceiling of her sleeping sons .</l>
     <l n="97">O'er devastation we blind revels keep ;</l>
     <l n="98">Whole buried towns support the dancer 's heel .</l>
     <l n="99">The moist of human frame the sun exhales ;</l>
     <l n="100">Winds scatter through the mighty void the dry ; 100</l>
     <l n="101">Earth repossesses part of what she gave ,</l>
     <l n="102">And the freed spirit mounts on wings of fire ;</l>
     <l n="103">Each element partakes our scatter 'd spoils ;</l>
     <l n="104">As nature , wide , our ruins spread : man 's death</l>
     <l n="105">Inhabits all things , but the thought of man .</l>
     <l n="106">Nor man alone ; his breathing bust expires ,</l>
     <l n="107">His tomb is mortal ; empires die : where , now ,</l>
     <l n="108">The Roman ? Greek ? They stalk , an empty name !</l>
     <l n="109">Yet few regard them in this useful light ;</l>
     <l n="110">Though half our learning is their epitaph . 110</l>
     <l n="111">When down thy vale , unlock 'd by midnight thought ,</l>
     <l n="112">That loves to wander in thy sunless realms ,</l>
     <l n="113">O Death ! I stretch my view : what visions rise !</l>
     <l n="114">What triumphs ! toils imperial ! arts divine !</l>
     <l n="115">In wither 'd laurels glide before my sight !</l>
     <l n="116">What lengths of far-famed ages , billow 'd high</l>
     <l n="117">With human agitation , roll along</l>
     <l n="118">In unsubstantial images of air !</l>
     <l n="119">The melancholy ghosts of dead renown ,</l>
     <l n="120">Whispering faint echoes of the world 's applause , 120</l>
     <l n="121">With penitential aspect , as they pass ,</l>
     <l n="122">All point at earth , and hiss at human pride , 122</l>
     <l n="123">The wisdom of the wise , and prancings of the great .</l>
     <l n="124">But , O Lorenzo ! far the rest above ,</l>
     <l n="125">Of ghastly nature , and enormous size ,</l>
     <l n="126">One form assaults my sight , and chills my blood ,</l>
     <l n="127">And shakes my frame . Of one departed world<span type="note_anchor">[ 52 ]</span></l>
     <l n="128">I see the mighty shadow : oozy wreath</l>
     <l n="129">And dismal seaweed crown her ; o'er her urn</l>
     <l n="130">Reclined , she weeps her desolated realms , 130</l>
     <l n="131">And bloated sons ; and , weeping , prophesies</l>
     <l n="132">Another 's dissolution , soon , in flames .</l>
     <l n="133">But , like Cassandra , prophesies in vain ;</l>
     <l n="134">In vain , to many ; not , I trust , to thee .</l>
     <l n="135">For , know'st thou not , or art thou loath to know ,</l>
     <l n="136">The great decree , the counsel of the skies ?</l>
     <l n="137">Deluge and conflagration , dreadful powers !</l>
     <l n="138">Prime ministers of vengeance ! chain 'd in caves</l>
     <l n="139">Distinct , apart the giant furies roar ;</l>
     <l n="140">Apart ; or , such their horrid rage for ruin , 140</l>
     <l n="141">In mutual conflict would they rise , and wage</l>
     <l n="142">Eternal war , till one was quite devour 'd .</l>
     <l n="143">But not for this , ordain 'd their boundless rage ;</l>
     <l n="144">When Heaven 's inferior instruments of wrath ,</l>
     <l n="145">War , famine , pestilence , are found too weak</l>
     <l n="146">To scourge a world for her enormous crimes ,</l>
     <l n="147">These are let loose , alternate : down they rush ,</l>
     <l n="148">Swift and tempestuous , from th ’ eternal throne ,</l>
     <l n="149">With irresistible commission arm 'd ,</l>
     <l n="150">The world , in vain corrected , to destroy , 150</l>
     <l n="151">And ease creation of the shocking scene .</l>
     <l n="152">Seest thou , Lorenzo ! what depends on man ?</l>
     <l n="153">The fate of Nature ; as for man , her birth .</l>
     <l n="154">Earth 's actors change earth 's transitory scenes ,</l>
     <l n="155">And make creation groan with human guilt . 155</l>
     <l n="156">How must it groan , in a new deluge whelm 'd ,</l>
     <l n="157">But not of waters ! At the destined hour ,</l>
     <l n="158">By the loud trumpet summon 'd to the charge ,</l>
     <l n="159">See , all the formidable sons of fire ,</l>
     <l n="160">Eruptions , earthquakes , comets , lightnings , play</l>
     <l n="161">Their various engines ; all at once disgorge</l>
     <l n="162">Their blazing magazines ; and take , by storm , 162</l>
     <l n="163">This poor terrestrial citadel of man .</l>
     <l n="164">Amazing period ! when each mountain-height</l>
     <l n="165">Outburns Vesuvius ; rocks eternal pour</l>
     <l n="166">Their melted mass , as rivers once they pour 'd ;</l>

     <l n="1050">Thus , have we found a new , and noble sense , 1050</l>
     <l n="1051">In which alone stars govern human fates .</l>
     <l n="1052">O that the stars ( as some have feign 'd ) let fall</l>
     <l n="1053">Bloodshed , and havoc , on embattled realms ,</l>
     <l n="1054">And rescued monarchs from so black a guilt !</l>
     <l n="1055">Bourbon ! this wish how generous in a foe !</l>
     <l n="1056">Would'st thou be great , would'st thou become a god ,</l>

     <l n="1061">As yet thou know'st not what it is : how great ,</l>
     <l n="1062">How glorious , then , appears the mind of man ,</l>
     <l n="1063">When in it all the stars , and planets , roll !</l>
     <l n="1064">And what it seems , it is : great objects make</l>
     <l n="1065">Great minds , enlarging as their views enlarge ; 1065</l>
     <l n="1066">Those still more godlike , as these more divine .</l>
     <l n="1067">And more divine than these , thou canst not see .</l>

     <l n="1073">And tremble at my nakedness before him !</l>
     <l n="1074">O that I could but reach the tree of life !</l>
     <l n="1075">For here it grows , unguarded from our taste ;</l>
     <l n="1076">No flaming sword denies our entrance here ;</l>
     <l n="1077">Would man but gather , he might live for ever .</l>
     <l n="1078">Lorenzo ! much of moral hast thou seen .</l>

     <l n="1082">Lorenzo 's boasted builders , Chance , and Fate ,</l>

     <l n="1084">Wisdom and choice , their well-known characters</l>
     <l n="1085">Here deep impress ; and claim it for their own .</l>
     <l n="1086">Though splendid all , no splendour void of use ;</l>
     <l n="1087">Use rivals beauty ; art contends with power ;</l>
     <l n="1088">No wanton waste , amid effuse expense ;</l>
     <l n="1089">The great Economist adjusting all</l>
     <l n="1090">To prudent pomp , magnificently wise . 1090</l>
     <l n="1091">How rich the prospect ! and for ever new !</l>
     <l n="1092">And newest to the man that views it most ;</l>
     <l n="1093">For newer still in infinite succeeds .</l>
     <l n="1094">Then , these aerial racers , O how swift !</l>
     <l n="1095">How the shaft loiters from the strongest string !</l>

     <l n="1100">Like thine , it seems a vision or a dream ;</l>
     <l n="1101">Though seen , we labour to believe it true !</l>
     <l n="1102">What involution ! what extent ! what swarms</l>
     <l n="1103">Of worlds , that laugh at earth ! immensely great !</l>
     <l n="1104">Immensely distant from each other 's spheres !</l>
     <l n="1105">What , then , the wondrous space through which they roll ?</l>
     <l n="1106">At once it quite engulfs all human thought ;</l>
     <l n="1107">‘ Tis comprehension 's absolute defeat .</l>
     <l n="1108">Nor think thou seest a wild disorder here ;</l>
     <l n="1109">Through this illustrious chaos to the sight ,</l>

     <l n="1111">The path prescribed , inviolably kept ,</l>
     <l n="1112">Upbraids the lawless sallies of mankind .</l>
     <l n="1113">Worlds , ever thwarting , never interfere ;</l>
     <l n="1114">What knots are tied ! how soon are they dissolved ,</l>
     <l n="1115">And set the seeming married planets free !</l>
     <l n="1116">They rove for ever , without error rove ;</l>
     <l n="1117">Confusion unconfused ! nor less admire</l>
     <l n="1118">This tumult untumultuous ; all on wing !</l>
     <l n="1119">In motion , all ! yet what profound repose !</l>
     <l n="1120">What fervid action , yet no noise ! as awed 1120</l>
     <l n="1121">To silence , by the presence of their Lord ;</l>
     <l n="1122">Or hush 'd by His command , in love to man ,</l>
     <l n="1123">And bid let fall soft beams on human rest ,</l>
     <l n="1124">Restless themselves . On yon cerulean plain ,</l>
     <l n="1125">In exultation to their God , and thine ,</l>
     <l n="1126">They dance , they sing eternal jubilee ,</l>
     <l n="1127">Eternal celebration of His praise .</l>
     <l n="1128">But , since their song arrives not at our ear ,</l>
     <l n="1129">Their dance perplex 'd exhibits to the sight</l>
     <l n="1130">Fair hieroglyphic of His peerless power . 1130</l>
     <l n="1131">Mark how the labyrinthian turns they take ,</l>
     <l n="1132">The circles intricate , and mystic maze ,</l>
     <l n="1133">Weave the grand cipher of Omnipotence ; 1133</l>
     <l n="1134">To gods , how great ! how legible to man !</l>
     <l n="1135">Leaves so much wonder greater wonder still ?</l>
     <l n="1136">Where are the pillars that support the skies ?</l>
     <l n="1137">What more than Atlantean shoulder props</l>
     <l n="1138">Th ’ incumbent load ? What magic , what strange art ,</l>
     <l n="1139">In fluid air these ponderous orbs sustains ?</l>
     <l n="1140">Who would not think them hung in golden chains ?— 1140</l>
     <l n="1141">And so they are ; in the high will of heaven ,</l>
     <l n="1142">Which fixes all ; makes adamant of air ,</l>
     <l n="1143">Or air of adamant ; makes all of nought ,</l>
     <l n="1144">Or nought of all ; if such the dread decree .</l>
     <l n="1145">Imagine from their deep foundations torn</l>
     <l n="1146">The most gigantic sons of earth , the broad</l>
     <l n="1147">And towering Alps , all toss 'd into the sea ;</l>
     <l n="1148">And , light as down , or volatile as air ,</l>
     <l n="1149">Their bulks enormous , dancing on the waves ,</l>
     <l n="1150">In time , and measure , exquisite ; while all 1150</l>
     <l n="1151">The winds , in emulation of the spheres ,</l>
     <l n="1152">Tune their sonorous instruments aloft ;</l>
     <l n="1153">The concert swell , and animate the ball .</l>
     <l n="1154">Would this appear amazing ? What , then , worlds ,</l>
     <l n="1155">In a far thinner element sustain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="1156">And acting the same part , with greater skill ,</l>
     <l n="1157">More rapid movement , and for noblest ends ?</l>
     <l n="1158">More obvious ends to pass , are not these stars</l>
     <l n="1159">The seats majestic , proud imperial thrones ,</l>
     <l n="1160">On which angelic delegates of heaven , 1160</l>
     <l n="1161">At certain periods , as the Sovereign nods ,</l>
     <l n="1162">Discharge high trusts of vengeance , or of love ;</l>
     <l n="1163">To clothe , in outward grandeur , grand design ,</l>
     <l n="1164">And acts most solemn still more solemnize ?</l>
     <l n="1165">Ye citizens of air ! what ardent thanks ,</l>
     <l n="1166">What full effusion of the grateful heart ,</l>
     <l n="1167">Is due from man indulged in such a sight ! 1167</l>
     <l n="1168">A sight so noble ! and a sight so kind !</l>
     <l n="1169">It drops new truths at every new survey !</l>
     <l n="1170">Feels not Lorenzo something stir within ,</l>
     <l n="1171">That sweeps away all period ? As these spheres</l>
     <l n="1172">Measure duration , they no less inspire</l>
     <l n="1173">The godlike hope of ages without end .</l>
     <l n="1174">The boundless space , through which these rovers take</l>
     <l n="1175">Their restless roam , suggests the sister thought</l>
     <l n="1176">Of boundless time . Thus , by kind Nature 's skill ,</l>
     <l n="1177">To man unlabour 'd , that important guest ,</l>
     <l n="1178">Eternity , finds entrance at the sight :</l>
     <l n="1179">And an eternity , for man ordain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="1180">Or these his destined midnight counsellors , 1180</l>
     <l n="1181">The stars , had never whisper 'd it to man .</l>
     <l n="1182">Nature informs , but ne'er insults , her sons .</l>
     <l n="1183">Could she then kindle the most ardent wish</l>
     <l n="1184">To disappoint it ?— That is blasphemy .</l>
     <l n="1185">Thus , of thy creed a second article ,</l>
     <l n="1186">Momentous , as th ’ existence of a God ,</l>
     <l n="1187">Is found ( as I conceive ) where rarely sought ;</l>
     <l n="1188">And thou may'st read thy soul immortal , here .</l>
     <l n="1189">Here , then , Lorenzo ! on these glories dwell ;</l>
     <l n="1190">Nor want the gilt , illuminated , roof , 1190</l>
     <l n="1191">That calls the wretched gay to dark delights .</l>
     <l n="1192">Assemblies ?— This is one divinely bright ;</l>
     <l n="1193">Here , unendanger 'd in health , wealth , or fame ,</l>
     <l n="1194">Range through the fairest , and the Sultan scorn ;</l>
     <l n="1195">He , wise as thou , no crescent holds so fair ,</l>
     <l n="1196">As that , which on his turban awes a world ;</l>
     <l n="1197">And thinks the moon is proud to copy him .</l>
     <l n="1198">Look on her , and gain more than worlds can give ,</l>
     <l n="1199">A mind superior to the charms of power .</l>
     <l n="1200">Thou muffled in delusions of this life ! 1200</l>
     <l n="1201">Can yonder moon turn ocean in his bed , 1201</l>
     <l n="1202">From side to side , in constant ebb , and flow ,</l>
     <l n="1203">And purify from stench his watery realms ?</l>
     <l n="1204">And fails her moral influence ? wants she power</l>
     <l n="1205">To turn Lorenzo 's stubborn tide of thought</l>
     <l n="1206">From stagnating on earth 's infected shore ,</l>
     <l n="1207">And purge from nuisance his corrupted heart ?</l>
     <l n="1208">Fails her attraction when it draws to heaven ?</l>
     <l n="1209">Nay , and to what thou valuest more , earth 's joy ?</l>
     <l n="1210">Minds elevate , and panting for unseen , 1210</l>
     <l n="1211">And defecate<span type="note_anchor">[ 66 ]</span>from sense , alone obtain</l>
     <l n="1212">Full relish of existence undeflower 'd ,</l>
     <l n="1213">The life of life , the zest of worldly bliss :</l>
     <l n="1214">All else on earth amounts — to what ? to this :</l>
     <l n="1215">“ Bad to be suffer 'd ; blessings to be left : ”</l>
     <l n="1216">Earth 's richest inventory boasts no more .</l>
     <l n="1217">Of higher scenes be , then , the call obey 'd .</l>
     <l n="1218">O let me gaze !— Of gazing there 's no end .</l>
     <l n="1219">O let me think !— Thought too is wilder 'd here ;</l>
     <l n="1220">In midway flight imagination tires ; 1220</l>
     <l n="1221">Yet soon reprunes her wing to soar anew ,</l>
     <l n="1222">Her point unable to forbear , or gain ;</l>
     <l n="1223">So great the pleasure , so profound the plan !</l>
     <l n="1224">A banquet , this , where men , and angels , meet ,</l>
     <l n="1225">Eat the same manna , mingle earth and heaven .</l>
     <l n="1226">How distant some of these nocturnal suns !</l>
     <l n="1227">So distant ( says the sage ) , ‘ twere not absurd</l>
     <l n="1228">To doubt , if beams , set out at Nature 's birth ,</l>
     <l n="1229">Are yet arrived at this so foreign world ;</l>
     <l n="1230">Though nothing half so rapid as their flight . 1230</l>
     <l n="1231">An eye of awe and wonder let me roll ,</l>
     <l n="1232">And roll for ever : who can satiate sight</l>
     <l n="1233">In such a scene ? in such an ocean wide</l>
     <l n="1234">Of deep astonishment ? where depth , height , breadth ,</l>
     <l n="1235">Are lost in their extremes ; and where to count 1235</l>
     <l n="1236">The thick-sown glories in this field of fire ,</l>
     <l n="1237">Perhaps a seraph 's computation fails .</l>
     <l n="1238">Now , go , Ambition ! boast thy boundless might</l>
     <l n="1239">In conquest , o'er the tenth part of a grain .</l>
     <l n="1240">And yet Lorenzo calls for miracles ,</l>
     <l n="1241">To give his tottering faith a solid base .</l>
     <l n="1242">Why call for less than is already thine ? 1242</l>
     <l n="1243">Thou art no novice in theology ;</l>
     <l n="1244">What is a miracle ?— ‘ Tis a reproach ,</l>
     <l n="1245">‘ Tis an implicit satire , on mankind ;</l>
     <l n="1246">And while it satisfies , it censures too .</l>
     <l n="1247">To common sense , great Nature 's course proclaims</l>
     <l n="1248">A Deity : when mankind falls asleep ,</l>
     <l n="1249">A miracle is sent , as an alarm ;</l>
     <l n="1250">To wake the world , and prove Him o'er again , 1250</l>
     <l n="1251">By recent argument , but not more strong .</l>
     <l n="1252">Say , which imports more plenitude of power ,</l>
     <l n="1253">Or nature 's laws to fix , or to repeal ?</l>
     <l n="1254">To make a sun , or stop his mid career ?</l>
     <l n="1255">To countermand his orders , and send back</l>
     <l n="1256">The flaming courier to the frighted east ,</l>
     <l n="1257">Warm 'd , and astonish 'd , at his evening ray ?</l>
     <l n="1258">Or bid the moon , as with her journey tired ,</l>
     <l n="1259">In Ajalon 's<span type="note_anchor">[ 67 ]</span>soft , flowery vale repose ?</l>
     <l n="1260">Great things are these ; still greater , to create . 1260</l>
     <l n="1261">From Adam 's bower look down through the whole train</l>
     <l n="1262">Of miracles ;— resistless is their power ?</l>

     <l n="1264">Than this , call 'd unmiraculous survey ,</l>
     <l n="1265">If duly weigh 'd , if rationally seen ,</l>

     <l n="1268">Say'st thou , “ The course of nature governs all ? ”</l>
     <l n="1269">The course of Nature is the art of God . 1269</l>
     <l n="1270">The miracles thou call'st for , this attest ;</l>

     <l n="1274">Who turns his eye on Nature 's midnight face ,</l>

     <l n="1437">Take it , in one compact , unbroken chain .</l>
     <l n="1438">Such proof insists on an attentive ear ;</l>
     <l n="1439">‘ Twill not make one amid a mob of thoughts , 1439</l>

     <l n="1445">Then , in thy soul 's deep silence , and the depth</l>

     <l n="1447">As I have done ; and shall inquire no more .</l>
     <l n="1448">In nature 's channel , thus the questions run :</l>
     <l n="1449">“ What am I ? and from whence ?— I nothing know ,</l>
     <l n="1450">But that I am ; and , since I am , conclude 1450</l>
     <l n="1451">Something eternal : had there e'er been nought ,</l>
     <l n="1452">Nought still had been : eternal there must be .—</l>
     <l n="1453">But what eternal ?— Why not human race ?</l>
     <l n="1454">And Adam 's ancestors without an end ?—</l>
     <l n="1455">That 's hard to be conceived ; since every link</l>
     <l n="1456">Of that long-chain 'd succession is so frail ;</l>
     <l n="1457">Can every part depend , and not the whole ?</l>
     <l n="1458">Yet grant it true ; new difficulties rise ;</l>
     <l n="1459">I 'm still quite out at sea ; nor see the shore .</l>
     <l n="1460">Whence earth , and these bright orbs ?— eternal too ?</l>
     <l n="1461">Grant matter was eternal ; still these orbs 1461</l>
     <l n="1462">Would want some other father ;— much design</l>
     <l n="1463">Is seen in all their motions , all their makes ;</l>
     <l n="1464">Design implies intelligence , and art ;</l>
     <l n="1465">That can n't be from themselves — or man ; that art</l>
     <l n="1466">Man scarce can comprehend , could man bestow ?</l>
     <l n="1467">And nothing greater yet allow 'd than man .—</l>
     <l n="1468">Who , motion , foreign to the smallest grain ,</l>
     <l n="1469">Shot through vast masses of enormous weight ?</l>
     <l n="1470">Who bid brute matter 's restive lump assume 1470</l>
     <l n="1471">Such various forms , and gave it wings to fly ?</l>
     <l n="1472">Has matter innate motion ? then each atom ,</l>
     <l n="1473">Asserting its indisputable right 1473</l>
     <l n="1474">To dance , would form an universe of dust :</l>
     <l n="1475">Has matter none ? Then whence these glorious forms</l>
     <l n="1476">And boundless flights , from shapeless , and reposed ?</l>
     <l n="1477">Has matter more than motion ? Has it thought ,</l>
     <l n="1478">Judgment , and genius ? Is it deeply learn 'd</l>
     <l n="1479">In mathematics ? Has it framed such laws ,</l>
     <l n="1480">Which but to guess , a Newton made immortal ?— 1480</l>
     <l n="1481">If so , how each sage atom laughs at me ,</l>
     <l n="1482">Who think a clod inferior to a man !</l>
     <l n="1483">If art , to form ; and counsel , to conduct ;</l>
     <l n="1484">And that with greater far than human skill ;</l>
     <l n="1485">Resides not in each block ;— a Godhead reigns .—</l>
     <l n="1486">Grant , then , invisible , eternal , Mind ;</l>
     <l n="1487">That granted , all is solved .— But , granting that ,</l>
     <l n="1488">Draw I not o'er me a still darker cloud ?</l>
     <l n="1489">Grant I not that which I can ne'er conceive ?</l>
     <l n="1490">A being without origin , or end !— 1490</l>
     <l n="1491">Hail , human liberty ! There is no God —</l>
     <l n="1492">Yet , why ? On either scheme that knot subsists ;</l>
     <l n="1493">Subsist it must , in God , or human race ;</l>
     <l n="1494">If in the last , how many knots beside ,</l>
     <l n="1495">Indissoluble all ?— Why choose it there ,</l>
     <l n="1496">Where , chosen , still subsist ten thousand more ?</l>
     <l n="1497">Reject it , where , that chosen , all the rest</l>
     <l n="1498">Dispersed , leave reason 's whole horizon clear ?</l>
     <l n="1499">This is not reason 's dictate ; Reason says ,</l>
     <l n="1500">Close with the side where one grain turns the scale ;— 1500</l>
     <l n="1501">What vast preponderance is here ! can reason</l>
     <l n="1502">With louder voice exclaim — Believe a God ?</l>
     <l n="1503">And reason heard , is the sole mark of man .</l>
     <l n="1504">What things impossible must man think true ,</l>
     <l n="1505">On any other system ! and how strange</l>
     <l n="1506">To disbelieve , through mere credulity ! ”</l>
     <l n="1507">If , in this chain , Lorenzo finds no flaw , 1507</l>
     <l n="1508">Let it for ever bind him to belief .</l>
     <l n="1509">And where the link , in which a flaw he finds ?</l>
     <l n="1510">And , if a God there is , that God how great !</l>
     <l n="1511">How great that Power , whose providential care</l>
     <l n="1512">Through these bright orbs ’ dark centres darts a ray !</l>
     <l n="1513">Of nature universal threads the whole !</l>

     <l n="1851">Full well it might ! I quite mistook my road .</l>
     <l n="1852">Born in an age more curious than devout ;</l>
     <l n="1853">More fond to fix the place of heaven , or hell ,</l>

     <l n="1858">Who worship God , shall find him . Humble Love ,</l>
     <l n="1859">And not proud Reason , keeps the door of heaven ;</l>
     <l n="1860">Love finds admission , where proud Science fails . 1860</l>
     <l n="1861">Man 's science is the culture of his heart ;</l>

     <l n="1863">Of nature , or the more profound of God .</l>
     <l n="1864">Either to know , is an attempt that sets</l>

     <l n="1866">To fathom nature ( ill attempted here ! )</l>
     <l n="1867">Past doubt is deep philosophy above ;</l>

   <note>BALLANTYNE , PRINTER , EDINBURGH . LIBRARY EDITION OF THE BRITISH POETS . ISSUE FOR THE SECOND YEAR . The Publisher begs to announce that the Issue for the Second Year will consist of the Poetical Works of BUTLER , 2 vols . ; COWPER , 3 vols . ; BLAIR , BRUCE , LOGAN , BEATTIE , and FALCONER , 1 vol . These will immediately be followed by the publication of the Poetical Works of DRYDEN , POPE , BURNS , &amp; c. &amp; c. The Publisher has much gratification in referring to the reception which this Series of the British Poets has met with , and he begs to assure the Subscribers that every exertion will be made to insure this Edition being distinguished by the specific features proposed , namely , “ accuracy in the text , elegance of appearance , and extreme cheapness . ” The arrangements which now exist for collating the text , and securing accuracy in this important feature , are such as warrant the assertion that this Edition will be found to stand a favourable comparison with any hitherto published , or any that may hereafter be issued . The Publisher and Editor have peculiar pleasure in acknowledging the ready and hearty approval of their efforts by the press . It is seldom that any undertaking has been so warmly received , or the manner in which it has been executed so generally approved . This appreciation of their purpose will stimulate them to still greater exertions in the prosecution of their design — to produce this portion of the standard literature of our country in a style more befitting the merits of the authors than any hitherto attempted , and to secure for this series that it shall be worthy of recognition as THE LIBRARY EDITION OF THE BRITISH POETS . Edinburgh , November 1853 . LIBRARY EDITION OF THE BRITISH POETS , In Demy 8vo , Pica Type , Extra Cloth Boards . EDITED BY REV . G. GILFILLAN . Now ready , Vols . 1 &amp; 2 . Milton 's Poetical Works . " " 3 . Thomson 's Poetical Works . " " 4 . Herbert 's Poetical Works . " " 5 . Young 's Night Thoughts . And on 1st Feb. 1854 , the Poetical Works of Goldsmith , Collins , and T. Warton . FORMING THE FIRST YEARLY ISSUE TO SUBSCRIBERS OF SIX VOLUMES FOR ONE GUINEA . ISSUE FOR THE SECOND YEAR —</note>
   <div type="otherbooks">
    <p>THE POETICAL WORKS OF BUTLER — COWPER — BLAIR — BRUCE — LOGAN — BEATTIE , and FALCONER . Prospectuses containing full details of the Scheme may be obtained from most Booksellers , or from the Publisher , on application . Non-Subscribers can obtain the Volumes separately at 4s . 6d . each . Subscribers ’ Names received by all Booksellers for the Yearly Issue of Six Vols . for L1 , 1s . The Publisher has pleasure in submitting the following Extracts from recent Notices which have appeared of the Vols . already issued :— Literary Gazette . Coleridge said , that for a man fully to appreciate George Herbert , he must be “ an affectionate and dutiful son of the Church , and from habit , conviction , and a constitutional predisposition to ceremoniousness in piety as in manners , find her forms and ordinances aids of religion , not sources of formality . ” Mr Gilfillan has none of the qualifications here described , yet never was the character of Herbert more highly appreciated , nor his poetry more unreservedly admired , than by this Presbyterian editor . The editorial work is done with true Christian liberality , and with the sympathy of a man of genius . The present volume forms one of the new series of the “ English Poetical Classics , ” published by Mr Nichol of Edinburgh . In typography and appearance they are very superior , and they are issued at a price of unusual cheapness . The series will form a beautiful and valuable library edition of the English Classic Poets . Scottish Review . In this age of puffs and puffing , it is really pleasing to find pretensions at first somewhat startling , though modestly enough proclaimed , so well sustained . Six such volumes for twenty-one shillings ! We are not surprised that they are said to be “ offered at about one-third of the usual selling price . ” Independently altogether of the original matter furnished by Mr Gilfillan , the poetical works of John Milton , produced in such a style , are certainly worthy of a place in the best libraries . We know of no issue from the press which , as to paper , type , and general getting up , commends itself to public favour at so small a charge . Eclectic Review . The proposal issued by Mr Nichol is remarkable even in this age of cheap literature , and will go far to supply what has been long needed ,— an accurate , elegant , and cheap edition of our Poets . Such a guinea 's worth was never issued before , and we are much mistaken if the series does not obtain a large circulation . The volumes are issued in handsome style , and every care will be taken to secure the accuracy of the editions . Mr Gilfillan 's temperament involves some of the choicest elements of poetic impressions , while his critical canons are for the most part sound and trustworthy . Perthshire Courier . It is almost unnecessary for us to say more than what is now universally admitted , that this is the best and cheapest edition of the British Poets ever offered to the public . Setting aside their acknowledged and standard elegance , they are the cheapest books we have ever seen , and their being indispensable to the literary man , as well as the educated gentleman or well-read artisan , makes them doubly so . Tait 's Magazine . These volumes form part of a new series of the “ British Poets , ” published by Mr Nichol , in the form of substantial and elegant library volumes , at a price less than one third of that which the public have been accustomed to pay for tomes of such goodly parts and quality . Paper , print , and binding , are all excellent , the type large and clear .... The above extracts , more than anything we could say , will commend these volumes , and the series of which they form a part , to the good opinion of the reader . As a cheap and excellent library edition of the “ British Poets , ” they will prove acceptable to a very numerous class ; and under the management of their present able editor , we cannot harbour a doubt of their success with the public . The Monitor . When it was proposed that , at so low a price as a subscription of a guinea in the year , six volumes , in a superior style of execution , would be issued , we could not but admire the enterprise of the publisher , and heartily wish all success to the undertaking . These volumes , the first in the series , fully justified our fondest anticipations , and give large promise that this admirable publication will secure , as it certainly deserves , extensive patronage . They are issued in a very attractive style — in a large bold type , paper of the best quality , and in neat and substantial binding . The editorial part of the undertaking is carefully and ably executed . Indeed , we know no living person who is better qualified to edit a uniform edition of the British Poets than the Rev . George Gilfillan . We tender to both the publisher and editor of this beautiful superior edition of the British Poets our grateful acknowledgments for commencing so important and valuable an undertaking . Clydesdale Journal . This series has now reached the fourth volume , and is fully sustaining the very favourable opinion expressed by the press in all parts of the country . Never was a work issued combining elegance and cheapness in so remarkable a degree . Bell 's Weekly Messenger . This volume is an additional proof of the excellency of the selection , the ability of the gifted editor , and the elegance of the publication . Cumberland Pacquet . This is the fourth volume of the library edition of the British Poets , projected by Mr Nichol , the enterprising Edinburgh publisher , one or two of the former volumes of which we have already had the pleasure of noticing . The design , and the style in which it was proposed to carry it out , as indicated by the first volume of the series , elicited the expression of our special admiration several months ago , and we have pleasure in stating that the volume now before us is in every respect a worthy successor to those which have preceded it . We may observe that the critical dissertation prefixed , from the pen of Mr Gilfillan , is worth the price of the entire volume . Aberdeen Journal . ... A few words respecting the series of publications of which this volume forms a part . They are issued , as our readers are aware , under the very efficient superintendence of George Gilfillan ; and we cannot speak of them but in terms of the warmest approval ; for , in point of form and elegance , and correctness of typography , they are on a level with the high-priced editions ; and in point of price , they are on a level with the most ordinary publications of popular works that have been got up for the popular market . The enterprise is indeed a noble one , and we wish it all manner of success . Dumfriesshire and Galloway Herald . This is the fourth volume of the new Edinburgh edition of the Poets — an edition , we must say , alike honourable to the publisher and editor . Mr Nichol 's undertaking is a noble one . We wish him all success in it . Glasgow Citizen . The edition before us , with its ample page and masculine type — very suitable for feeble eyes — forms part of Nichol 's fine and wonderfully cheap issue of the British Poets , under the able editorship of Mr Gilfillan . Four volumes are now out , comprising the works of Milton , Thomson , and Herbert . Newcastle Chronicle . The paper and printing of this volume , as of the others , are , however , beyond all praise , when compared with other “ people 's editions . ” Montrose , Arbroath , and Brechin Review . The editorial part is admirably performed by Mr Gilfillan ; the getting up quite the ne plus ultra of elegance and correctness ; and the price ( six volumes for a guinea ) is perhaps the very greatest marvel of this marvellous age of cheap publications . Commonwealth . Regarded as specimens of typography — as books , in short , in the mere sense of what is mechanical , they are among the most perfect we have seen . This new edition of the British Poets is an undertaking which is worthy of commendation and encouragement , even apart from the considerations to which we have alluded . The National Miscellany . It is a bold speculation on the part of a publisher to offer six handsome and well printed volumes for a guinea .... The printing , binding , and general appearance is far superior to what we could have at all expected for the price ; and the series being issued under the superintendence of a careful editor , entirely fulfils the import of the title , a Library Edition . The works which have already appeared , are those of Milton , Herbert , and Thomson .</p>
