    <head>THE INDISCREET CONFESSIONS</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">FAMED Paris ne'er within its walls had got ,</l>
     <l n="2">Such magick charms as were Aminta 's lot ,</l>
     <l n="3">Youth , beauty , temper , fortune , she possessed ,</l>
     <l n="4">And all that should a husband render blessed ,</l>
     <l n="5">The mother still retained her ‘ neath the wing ;</l>
     <l n="6">Her father 's riches well might lovers bring ;</l>
     <l n="7">Whate'er his daughter wished , he would provide ,</l>
     <l n="8">Amusements , jewels , dress , and much beside .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">BLITHE Damon for her having felt the dart ,</l>
     <l n="10">The belle received the offer of his heart ;</l>
     <l n="11">So well he managed and expressed his flame .</l>
     <l n="12">That soon her lord and master he became ,</l>
     <l n="13">By Hymen 's right divine , you may conceive ,</l>
     <l n="14">And nothing short of it you should believe .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">A YEAR had passed , and still our charming pair ,</l>
     <l n="16">Were always pleased , and blisses seemed to share ;</l>
     <l n="17">( The honeymoon appeared but just began )</l>
     <l n="18">And hopes were entertained to have a son ,</l>
     <l n="19">When Damon on the subject chanced to touch :</l>
     <l n="20">In truth , said he , my soul is troubled much ;</l>
     <l n="21">There is a fact , my dear , to you I 'll tell :</l>
     <l n="22">I wish sincerely ( since I love so well )</l>
     <l n="23">That for another , I had never known</l>
     <l n="24">Such fond affection as to you I 've shown ;</l>
     <l n="25">And none but you had entered in my breast ,</l>
     <l n="26">So worthy ev'ry way to be caressed .</l>
     <l n="27">I have howe'er experienced other flame ;</l>
     <l n="28">The fault 's acknowledged : I confess my shame .</l>
     <l n="29">‘ Twas in a wood ; the nymph was young and nice ,</l>
     <l n="30">And Cupid only near to give advice ;</l>
     <l n="31">So well he managed :— or so ill , you 'll say ;</l>
     <l n="32">A little girl I 've living at this day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="33">WHAT , cried Aminta , now to you I 'll state ;</l>
     <l n="34">What happened once to be your spouse 's fate ;</l>
     <l n="35">I was at home alone , to say the truth ,</l>
     <l n="36">When thither came by chance a sprightly youth .</l>
     <l n="37">The lad was handsome , with engaging mien ;</l>
     <l n="38">I felt his worth :— my nature is serene ;</l>
     <l n="39">In short so many things were our employ ,</l>
     <l n="40">I 've still upon my hands a little boy .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="41">THESE words no sooner had escaped the belle ,</l>
     <l n="42">Than Damon into jealous torments fell ;</l>
     <l n="43">With rage he left the room ; and on his way ,</l>
     <l n="44">A large pack-saddle near his footsteps lay ,</l>
     <l n="45">Which on his back he put , then cried aloud ,</l>
     <l n="46">I 'm saddled ! see ; round quickly came a crowd ;</l>
     <l n="47">The father , mother , all the servants ran ;</l>
     <l n="48">The neighbours too ; the husband then began</l>
     <l n="49">To state the circumstance that gave him pain ;</l>
     <l n="50">And fully all the folly to explain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="51">THE reader must not fail to keep in mind ;</l>
     <l n="52">Aminta 's parents were both rich and kind ,</l>
     <l n="53">And having only her to be their heir ,</l>
     <l n="54">The aged couple let the youthful pair ,</l>
     <l n="55">With all their train , within the house reside ,</l>
     <l n="56">And tranquilly the moments seemed to glide .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="57">THU mother fondly to her daughter flew ;</l>
     <l n="58">The father followed , keeping her in view ;</l>
     <l n="59">The dame went in , but he remained without :</l>
     <l n="60">To listen he designed beyond a doubt ;</l>
     <l n="61">The door was on the jar ; the sage drew near ;</l>
     <l n="62">In short , to all they said , he lent an ear ;</l>
     <l n="63">The lady thus he heard reproach her child :</l>
     <l n="64">You 're clearly wrong ; most silly may be styled ;</l>
     <l n="65">I 've many simpletons and ninnies seen ;</l>
     <l n="66">But such as you before there ne'er has been :</l>
     <l n="67">Who 'd have believed you indiscreet like this ?</l>
     <l n="68">Who forced you to reveal what was amiss ?</l>
     <l n="69">What obligation to divulge the fact ?</l>
     <l n="70">More girls than one have failed to be exact ;</l>
     <l n="71">The Devil 's crafty ; folks are wicked too ;</l>
     <l n="72">But that is no excuse , however true ;</l>
     <l n="73">In convents all of us should be immured ,</l>
     <l n="74">Till perfectly by Hymen 's bands secured .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="75">E'EN I who speak , alas ! have troubles met ;</l>
     <l n="76">Within my bosom oft I feel regret ;</l>
     <l n="77">Three children ere my marriage I had got ;</l>
     <l n="78">Have I your father told this secret blot ?</l>
     <l n="79">Have we together been less happy found ?</l>
     <l n="80">The list'ner had no sooner heard the sound ,</l>
     <l n="81">But like a man distracted off he flew ;</l>
     <l n="82">The saddle 's girth , which hazard near him threw ;</l>
     <l n="83">He took and fastened tightly ‘ bout his waist ,</l>
     <l n="84">Then bawled around and round with anxious haste ;</l>
     <l n="85">I 'm girth 'd ! d'ye see , completely taken in ;</l>
     <l n="86">The people stared , an ‘ gan to laugh and grin .</l>
     <l n="87">Though each was conscious , if the truth were known ;</l>
     <l n="88">The ridicule in turn might be his own .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="89">BOTH husbands madly ran from cross to square ,</l>
     <l n="90">And with their foolish clamours rent the air ;</l>
     <l n="91">I 'm saddled , hooted one ; I 'm girth 'd , said this ;</l>
     <l n="92">The latter some perhaps will doubt , and hiss ;</l>
     <l n="93">Such things however should not be disbelieved</l>
     <l n="94">For instance , recollect ( what 's well received ) ,</l>
     <l n="95">When Roland learned the pleasures and the charms ;</l>
     <l n="96">His rival , in the grot , had in his arms ,</l>
     <l n="97">With fist he gave his horse so hard a blow ,</l>
     <l n="98">It sunk at once to realms of poignant woe .</l>
     <l n="99">Might he not , training , round the hapless beast ,</l>
     <l n="100">From weight of saddle have its back released ,</l>
     <l n="101">And putting it upon his own , have cried ,</l>
     <l n="102">I 'm saddled , I 'm girth 'd , and much beside ;</l>
     <l n="103">( No matter this or that , since each is good ,)</l>
     <l n="104">Which Echo would repeat from hill to wood ?</l>
     <l n="105">You see that truth may be discovered here ;</l>
     <l n="106">That 's not enough ; its object should appear ;</l>
     <l n="107">And that I 'll show as further we proceed ;</l>
     <l n="108">Your full attention I of course shall need .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="109">THE happy Damon clearly seems to me ,</l>
     <l n="110">As poor a thing as any we shall see ;</l>
     <l n="111">His confidence would soon have spoiled the whole ,</l>
     <l n="112">To leave a belle like this without control !</l>
     <l n="113">Her simplicity I much admire :—</l>
     <l n="114">Confess herself to spouse , as if a friar !</l>
     <l n="115">What silliness ! imprudence is a word ,</l>
     <l n="116">Which here to use would truly be absurd .</l>
     <l n="117">To my discourse two heads alone remain ;</l>
     <l n="118">The marriage vow you always should maintain ;</l>
     <l n="119">Its faith the pair should ever keep in view :</l>
     <l n="120">The path of honour steadily pursue .</l>
     <l n="121">If some mishap howe'er should chance to glide ;</l>
     <l n="122">And make you limp on one or t'other side ,</l>
     <l n="123">Endeavour , of the fault , to make the best ,</l>
     <l n="124">And keep the secret locked within your breast ;</l>
     <l n="125">Your own consideration never lose ;</l>
     <l n="126">Untruth ‘ tis pardonable then to use .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="127">No doubt my pages nice advice supply ;</l>
     <l n="128">Is't what I 've followed ?— No , you may rely !</l>
    </lg>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE CONTRACT</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">THE husband 's dire mishap , and silly maid ,</l>
     <l n="2">In ev'ry age , have proved the fable 's aid ;</l>
     <l n="3">The fertile subject never will be dry :</l>
     <l n="4">‘ Tis inexhaustible , you may rely .</l>
     <l n="5">No man 's exempt from evils such as these :—</l>
     <l n="6">Who thinks himself secure , but little sees .</l>
     <l n="7">One laughs at sly intrigues who , ere ‘ tis long ,</l>
     <l n="8">May , in his turn , be sneered at by the throng :</l>
     <l n="9">With such vicissitudes , to be cast down ,</l>
     <l n="10">Appears rank nonsense worthy Folly 's crown .</l>
     <l n="11">He , whose adventures I 'm about to write ,</l>
     <l n="12">In his mischances ,— found what gave delight .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">A CERTAIN Citizen , with fortune large ,</l>
     <l n="14">When settled with a handsome wife in charge ,</l>
     <l n="15">Not long attended for the marriage fruit :</l>
     <l n="16">The lady soon put matters ‘ yond dispute ;</l>
     <l n="17">Produced a girl at first , and then a boy ,</l>
     <l n="18">To fill th ’ expecting parent 's breast with joy .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="19">THE son , when grown of size , a tutor had ,</l>
     <l n="20">No pedant rude , with Greek and Latin mad ,</l>
     <l n="21">But young and smart , a master too of arts ,</l>
     <l n="22">Particularly learned in what imparts ,</l>
     <l n="23">The gentle flame , the pleasing poignant pang ,</l>
     <l n="24">That Ovid formerly so sweetly sang .</l>
     <l n="25">Some knowledge of good company he 'd got ;</l>
     <l n="26">A charming voice and manner were his lot ;</l>
     <l n="27">And if we may disclose the mystick truth ,</l>
     <l n="28">‘ Twas Cupid who preceptor made the youth .</l>
     <l n="29">He with the brother solely took a place ,</l>
     <l n="30">That better he the sister 's charms might trace ;</l>
     <l n="31">And under this disguise he fully gained</l>
     <l n="32">What he desired , so well his part he feigned :</l>
     <l n="33">An able master , or a lover true ,</l>
     <l n="34">To teach or sigh , whichever was in view ,</l>
     <l n="35">So thoroughly he could attention get ,</l>
     <l n="36">Success alike in ev'ry thing he met .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="37">IN little time the boy could construe well</l>
     <l n="38">The odes of Horace :— Virgil 's fable tell ;</l>
     <l n="39">And she whose beauty caught the tutor 's eyes ,</l>
     <l n="40">A perfect mistress got of heaving sighs .</l>
     <l n="41">So oft she practised what the master taught ,</l>
     <l n="42">Her stomach feeble grew , whate'er was sought ;</l>
     <l n="43">And strange suspicions of the cause arose ,</l>
     <l n="44">Which Time at length was driven to disclose .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="45">MOST terribly the father raged and swore ;</l>
     <l n="46">Our learned master , frightened , left the door ,</l>
     <l n="47">The lady wished to take the youth for life ;</l>
     <l n="48">The spark desired to make the girl his wife ;</l>
     <l n="49">Both had the Hymeneal knot in view ,</l>
     <l n="50">And mutual soft affection fondly knew .</l>
     <l n="51">At present love is little more than name :</l>
     <l n="52">In matrimony , gold 's the only aim .</l>
     <l n="53">The belle was rich , while he had nothing got ;</l>
     <l n="54">For him ‘ twas great :— for her a narrow lot .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="55">O DIRE corruption , age of wretched ways !</l>
     <l n="56">What strange caprice such management displays !</l>
     <l n="57">Shall we permit this fatal pow'r to reign ?</l>
     <l n="58">Base int'rest ' s impulse : hideous modern stain ;</l>
     <l n="59">The curse of ev'ry tender soft delight ,</l>
     <l n="60">That charms the soul and fascinates the sight .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="61">BUT truce to moral ; let 's our tale resume ;</l>
     <l n="62">The daughter scared ; the father in a fume ;</l>
     <l n="63">What could be done the evil to repair ,</l>
     <l n="64">And hide the sad misfortune of the fair ?</l>
     <l n="65">What method seek ?— They married her in haste ;</l>
     <l n="66">But not to him who had the belle debased ,</l>
     <l n="67">For reasons I 've sufficiently detailed ;</l>
     <l n="68">To gain her hand a certain wight prevailed ,</l>
     <l n="69">Who store of riches relished far above</l>
     <l n="70">The charms of beauty , warmed with fondest love .</l>
     <l n="71">Save this the man might well enough be thought :</l>
     <l n="72">In family and wealth just what was sought ;</l>
     <l n="73">But whether fool or not , I cannot trace ,</l>
     <l n="74">Since he was unacquainted with the case ;</l>
     <l n="75">And if he 'd known it , was the bargain bad ?</l>
     <l n="76">Full twenty thousand pounds he with her had</l>
     <l n="77">A sprightly youthful wife to ease his care ,</l>
     <l n="78">And with him ev'ry luxury to share .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="79">HOW many tempted by the golden ore ,</l>
     <l n="80">Have taken wives whose slips they know before ;</l>
     <l n="81">And this good man the lady chaste believed ,</l>
     <l n="82">So truly well she managed and deceived .</l>
     <l n="83">But when four months had passed , the fair-one showed .</l>
     <l n="84">How very much she to her lessons owed ;</l>
     <l n="85">A little girl arrived : the husband stared</l>
     <l n="86">Cried he , what father of a child declared !</l>
     <l n="87">The time 's too short : four months ! I 'm taken in !</l>
     <l n="88">A family should not so soon begin .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="89">AWAY he to the lady 's father flew ,</l>
     <l n="90">And of his shame a horrid picture drew ;</l>
     <l n="91">Proposed to be divorced : much rage disclosed ;</l>
     <l n="92">The parent smiled and said , pray be composed ;</l>
     <l n="93">Speak not so loud : we may be overheard ,</l>
     <l n="94">And privacy is much to be preferred .</l>
     <l n="95">A son-in-law , like you , I once appeared ,</l>
     <l n="96">And similar misfortune justly feared ;</l>
     <l n="97">Complaint I made , and mentioned a divorce ;</l>
     <l n="98">Of heat and rage the ordinary course .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="99">THE father of my wife , who 's now no more ,</l>
     <l n="100">( Heav'n guard his soul , the loss I oft deplore ,)</l>
     <l n="101">A prudent honest man as any round ,</l>
     <l n="102">To calm my mind , a nice specifick found ;</l>
     <l n="103">The pill was rather bitter , I admit ;</l>
     <l n="104">But gilding made it for the stomach fit ,</l>
     <l n="105">Which he knew how to manage very well :</l>
     <l n="106">No doctor in it him could e'er excel ;</l>
     <l n="107">To satisfy my scruples he displayed</l>
     <l n="108">A CONTRACT ( duly stamped and ably made ) ,</l>
     <l n="109">Four thousand to secure , which he had got ,</l>
     <l n="110">On similar occasion for a blot ;</l>
     <l n="111">His lady 's father gave it to efface</l>
     <l n="112">Domestick diff'rences and like disgrace :</l>
     <l n="113">With this my spouse 's fortune he increased ;</l>
     <l n="114">And instantly my dire complaining ceased .</l>
     <l n="115">From family to family the deed</l>
     <l n="116">Should pass , ‘ twill often prove a useful meed ;</l>
     <l n="117">I kept it for the purpose :— do the same</l>
     <l n="118">Your daughter , married , may have equal blame .</l>
     <l n="119">On this the son-in-law the bond received ,</l>
     <l n="120">And , with a bow , departed much relieved .</l>

     <l n="1">DAME FORTUNE often loves a laugh to raise ,</l>

     <l n="3">Instead of giving us what we desire ,</l>
     <l n="4">Mere quid pro quo permits us to acquire .</l>
     <l n="5">I 've found her gambols such from first to last ,</l>
     <l n="6">And judge the future by experience past .</l>
     <l n="7">Fair Cloris and myself felt mutual flame ;</l>
     <l n="8">And , when a year had run , the sprightly dame</l>
     <l n="9">Prepared to grant me , if I may be plain ,</l>
     <l n="10">Some slight concessions that would ease my pain .</l>
     <l n="11">This was her aim ; but whatsoe'er in view ,</l>
     <l n="12">‘ Tis opportunity we should pursue ;</l>
     <l n="13">The lover , who 's discreet , will moments seize ;</l>

     <l n="18">The master came , not doubting all was right ;</l>
     <l n="19">No Cloris howsoe'er was in the way ;</l>
     <l n="20">A servant girl , of disposition gay ,</l>

     <l n="41">THERE Clidamant , whose proper name my verse ,</l>
     <l n="42">Prom high respect , refuses to rehearse ,</l>
     <l n="43">Lived much at ease : not one a wife had got ,</l>
     <l n="44">Throughout the realm , who was so nice a lot ,</l>
     <l n="45">Her virtues , temper , and seraphick charms ,</l>
     <l n="46">Should have secured the husband to her arms ;</l>
     <l n="47">But he was not to constancy inclined ;</l>

     <l n="51">THE lady had a maid , whose form and size ,</l>
     <l n="52">Height , easy manners , action , lips , and eyes ,</l>
     <l n="53">Were thought to be so very like her own ,</l>
     <l n="54">That one from t'other scarcely could be known ;</l>
     <l n="55">The mistress was the prettiest of the two ;</l>
     <l n="56">But , in a mask where much escapes the view ,</l>
     <l n="57">‘ Twas very difficult a choice to make ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="59">THE Marseillesian husband , rather gay ,</l>
     <l n="60">With mistress Alice was disposed to play ;</l>
     <l n="61">( For such was called the maid we just have named ;)</l>
     <l n="62">To show coquettish airs the latter aimed ,</l>
     <l n="63">And met his wishes with reproof severe ;</l>
     <l n="64">But to his plan the lover would adhere ,</l>
     <l n="65">And promised her at length a pretty sum :</l>
     <l n="66">A hundred crowns , if to his room she 'd come .</l>
     <l n="67">To pay the girl with kindness such as this ,</l>
     <l n="68">In my opinion , was not much amiss .</l>
     <l n="69">At that rate what should be the mistress ’ price ?</l>
     <l n="70">Perhaps still less : she might not be so nice .</l>
     <l n="71">But I mistake ; the lady was so coy ,</l>
     <l n="72">No spark , whatever art he could employ ,</l>
     <l n="73">How cleverly soe'er he laid the snare ,</l>
     <l n="74">Would have succeeded , spite of ev'ry care .</l>
     <l n="75">Nor presents nor attentions would have swayed ;</l>
     <l n="76">Should I have mentioned presents as an aid ?</l>
     <l n="77">Alas ! no longer these are days of old !</l>
     <l n="78">By Love both nymph and shepherdess are sold ;</l>
     <l n="79">He sets the price of many beauties rare ;</l>
     <l n="80">This was a god ;— now nothing but a mayor .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="81">O ALTERED times ! O customs how depraved !</l>
     <l n="82">At first fair Alice frowardly behaved ;</l>
     <l n="83">But in the sequel ‘ gan to change her way ,</l>
     <l n="84">And said , her mistress , as the foll'wing day ,</l>
     <l n="85">A certain remedy to take designed ;</l>
     <l n="86">That , in the morning then , if so inclined ,</l>
     <l n="87">They could at leisure in the cavern meet ;—</l>
     <l n="88">The plan was pleasing : all appeared discreet .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="89">THE servant , having to her mistress said ,</l>
     <l n="90">What projects were in view : what nets were spread ;</l>
     <l n="91">The females , ‘ tween themselves , a plot contrived ,</l>
     <l n="92">Of Quid pro quo , against the hour arrived .</l>
     <l n="93">The husband of the trick was ne'er aware ,</l>
     <l n="94">So much the mistress had her servant 's air ;</l>
     <l n="95">But if he had , what then ? no harm of course ;</l>
     <l n="96">She might have lectured him with double force .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="97">NEXT day but one , gay Clidamant , whose joy</l>
     <l n="98">Appeared so great , ‘ twas free from all alloy ,</l>
     <l n="99">By hazard met a friend , to whom he told</l>
     <l n="100">( Most indiscreetly ) what to him was sold ;</l>
     <l n="101">How Cupid favoured what he most required ,</l>
     <l n="102">And freely granted all he had desired .</l>
     <l n="103">Though large the blessing , yet he grudged the cost ;</l>
     <l n="104">The sum gave pain : a hundred crowns were lost !</l>
     <l n="105">The friend proposed they should at once decide ,</l>
     <l n="106">The charge and pleasure ‘ tween them to divide .</l>
     <l n="107">Our husband thought his purse not over strong ,</l>
     <l n="108">That saving fifty crowns would not be wrong .</l>
     <l n="109">But then , on t'other hand , to lend the fair ,</l>
     <l n="110">In ev'ry view had got an awkward air ;</l>
     <l n="111">Would she , as was proposed , consent to two ?</l>
     <l n="112">To keep things secret would their lips be true ?</l>
     <l n="113">Or was it fair to sacrifice her charms ,</l>
     <l n="114">And lay her open thus to dire alarms ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="115">THE friend this difficulty soon removed ,</l>
     <l n="116">And represented that the cavern proved</l>
     <l n="117">So very dark , the girl would be deceived ;</l>
     <l n="118">With one more shrewd the trick might be achieved .</l>
     <l n="119">Sufficient howsoever it would be ,</l>
     <l n="120">If they by turns , and silent , could agree</l>
     <l n="121">To meet the belle , and leave to Love the rest ,</l>
     <l n="122">From whom they hoped assistance if distressed .</l>
     <l n="123">Such silence to observe no hurt could do ,</l>
     <l n="124">And Alice would suppose , a prudent view</l>
     <l n="125">Retained the tongue , since walls have often ears ,</l>
     <l n="126">And , being mum , expressive was of fears .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="127">WHEN thus the two gallants their plan had laid ,</l>
     <l n="128">And ev'ry promised pleasure fully weighed ,</l>
     <l n="129">They to the husband 's mansion made their way ,</l>
     <l n="130">Where yet the wife between the bed-clothes lay .</l>
     <l n="131">The servant girl was near her mistress found ;</l>
     <l n="132">Her dress was plain : no finery around ;</l>
     <l n="133">In short , ‘ twas such that , when the moment came ;</l>
     <l n="134">To fail the meeting could not be her aim .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="135">THE friends disputed which the lead should take ,</l>
     <l n="136">And strong pretentions both appeared to make ;</l>
     <l n="137">The husband , honours home would not allow :</l>
     <l n="138">Such compliments were out of fashion now .</l>
     <l n="139">To settle this , at length three dice they took ;</l>
     <l n="140">The friend was highest placed in Fortune 's book .</l>
     <l n="141">The both together to the cavern flew ,</l>
     <l n="142">And for the servant soon impatient grew ;</l>
     <l n="143">But Alice never came , and in her room</l>
     <l n="144">The mistress , softly treading ‘ mid the gloom ,</l>
     <l n="145">The necessary signal gently gave ,</l>
     <l n="146">On which she entered presently the cave ,</l>
     <l n="147">And this so suddenly , no time was found</l>
     <l n="148">To make remarks on change or errors round ,</l>
     <l n="149">Or any diff'rence ‘ tween the friend and spouse ;</l>
     <l n="150">In short , before suspicions ‘ gan to rouse ,</l>
     <l n="151">Or alteration lent the senses aid :—</l>
     <l n="152">To LOVE , a sacrifice was fully made .</l>
     <l n="153">The lucky wight more pleasure would have felt ,</l>
     <l n="154">If sensible he 'd been with whom he dealt :</l>
     <l n="155">The mistress rather more of beauty had ,</l>
     <l n="156">And QUALITY of course must something add .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="157">THIS scene just ended , t'other actor came ,</l>
     <l n="158">Whose prompt arrival much surprised the dame ,</l>
     <l n="159">For , as a husband , Clidamant had ne'er</l>
     <l n="160">Such ardour shown , he seemed beyond his sphere .</l>
     <l n="161">The lady to the girl imputed this ,</l>
     <l n="162">And thought , to hint it , would not be amiss .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="163">THE entertainment o'er , away they went</l>
     <l n="164">To quit the dark abode they were intent .</l>
     <l n="165">The partner in amour repaired above ;</l>
     <l n="166">But when the husband saw his wedded love</l>
     <l n="167">Ascend the stairs , and she the friend perceived ,</l>
     <l n="168">We well may judge how bosoms beat and heaved .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="169">THE master of the house conceived it best</l>
     <l n="170">To keep the whole a secret in his breast .</l>
     <l n="171">But to discover ALL , his lovely rib</l>
     <l n="172">Appeared disposed , though wives can often fib ;</l>
     <l n="173">The silliest of the throng ( or high or low ) ,</l>
     <l n="174">Most perfectly the science seem to know .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="175">SOME will pretend that Alice , in her heart</l>
     <l n="176">Was sorry she had acted such a part ,</l>
     <l n="177">And not a better method sought to gain</l>
     <l n="178">The money which had caused her master 's pain ;</l>
     <l n="179">Lamented much the case , and tried to please</l>
     <l n="180">By ev'ry means that might his trouble ease .</l>
     <l n="181">But this is merely with design to make</l>
     <l n="182">The tale a more impressive feature take .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="183">TWO questions may agitate around ;</l>
     <l n="184">The one , if ‘ mong the brotherhood renowned ,</l>
     <l n="185">The husband , who thus felt disgraced ,</l>
     <l n="186">Should ( with the usual ornaments ) be placed ?</l>
     <l n="187">But I no grounds for such conclusion see :</l>
     <l n="188">Both friend and wife were from suspicion free ;</l>
     <l n="189">Of one another they had never thought ,</l>
     <l n="190">Though in the mystick scene together brought .</l>
     <l n="191">The other is :— Should she , who was misused ,</l>
     <l n="192">Have sought revenge for being so abused ?</l>
     <l n="193">Though this sufficiently I have maintained ,</l>
     <l n="194">The lady inconsolable remained .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="195">HEAV'N guard the FAIR , who meet with ills like these ,</l>
     <l n="196">And nothing can their wounded minds appease :</l>
     <l n="197">I many know howe'er , who would but laugh ,</l>
     <l n="198">And treat such accidents as light as chaff .</l>
     <l n="199">But I have done : no more of that or this ;</l>
     <l n="200">May ev'ry belle receive her lot of bliss !</l>
