    <head>TO THE READER .</head>
    <p n="1">Poeta nascitur non fit , [ poets are born , not made ] is a sentence of as great truth as antiquity ; it being most certain , that all the acquired learning imaginable is insufficient to compleat a poet , without a natural genius and propensity to so noble and sublime an art . And we may , without offence , observe , that many very learned men , who have been ambitious to be thought poets , have only rendered themselves obnoxious to that satyrical inspiration our Author wittily invokes :</p>
    <p n="2">Which made them , though it were in spight Of nature and their stars , to write .</p>
    <p n="3">On the one side some who have had very little human learning , but were endued with a large share of natural wit and parts , have become the most celebrated ( Shakespear , D'Avenant , &amp; c .) poets of the age they lived in . But , as these last are , “ Rarae aves in terris , ” so , when the muses have not disdained the assistances of other arts and sciences , we are then blessed with those lasting monuments of wit and learning , which may justly claim a kind of eternity upon earth . And our author , had his modesty permitted him , might , with Horace , have said ,</p>
    <p n="4">Exegi monumentum aere perennius : [ I have raised a memorial more lasting than bronze ]</p>
    <p n="5">Or , with Ovid ,</p>
    <p n="6">Jamque opus exegi , quod nec Jovis ira , nec ignis , Nec poterit ferrum , nec edax abolere vetustas . [ For I have raised a work which neither the rage of Jupiter , Nor fire , nor iron , nor consuming age can destroy . ]</p>
    <p n="7">The Author of this celebrated Poem was of this his last composition : for although he had not the happiness of an academical education , as some affirm , if may be perceived , throughout his whole Poem , that he had read much , and was very well accomplished in the most useful parts of human learning .</p>
    <p n="8">Rapin ( in his reflections ) speaking of the necessary qualities belonging to a poet , tells us , he must have a genius extraordinary ; great natural gifts ; a wit just , fruitful , piercing , solid , and universal ; an understanding clear and distinct ; an imagination neat and pleasant ; an elevation of soul , that depends not only on art or study , but is purely the gift of heaven , which must be sustained by a lively sense and vivacity ; judgment to consider wisely of things , and vivacity for the beautiful expression of them , &amp; c .</p>
    <p n="9">Now , how justly this character is due to our Author , we leave to the impartial reader , and those of nicer judgment , who had the happiness to be more intimately acquainted with him .</p>
    <p n="10">The reputation of this incomparable Poem is so thoroughly established in the world , that it would be superfluous , if not impertinent , to endeavour any panegyric upon it . King Charles II . whom the judicious part of mankind will readily acknowledge to be a sovereign judge of wit , was so great an admirer of it , that he would often pleasantly quote it in his conversation . However , since most men have a curiosity to have some account of such anonymous authors , whose compositions have been eminent for wit or learning , we have , for their information , subjoined a short Life of the Author .</p>

  <body>
   <head>THE AUTHOR 'S LIFE .</head>
   <p>Samuel Butler , the Author of this excellent Poem , was born in the Parish of Strensham , in the county of Worcester , and baptized there the 13th of Feb. 1612 . His father , who was of the same name , was an honest country farmer , who had some small estate of his own , but rented a much greater of the Lord of the Manor where he lived . However , perceiving in this son an early inclination to learning , he made a shift to have him educated in the free-school at Worcester , under Mr. Henry Bright ; where having passed the usual time , and being become an excellent school-scholar , he went for some little time to Cambridge , but was never matriculated into that University , his father 's abilities not being sufficient to be at the charge of an academical education ; so that our Author returned soon into his native county , and became clerk to one Mr. Jefferys , of Earl'shYpppHeNCroom , an eminent Justice of the Peace for that County , with whom he lived some years , in an easy and no contemptible service . Here by the indulgence of a kind master , he had sufficient leisure to apply himself to whatever learning his inclinations led him , which were chiefly history and poetry ; to which , for his diversion , he joined music and painting ; and I have seen some pictures , said to be of his drawing , which remained in that family ; which I mention not for the excellency of them , but to satisfy the reader of his early inclinations to that noble art ; for which also he was afterwards entirely beloved by Mr. Samuel Cooper , one of the most eminent painters of his time .</p>
   <p>He was after this recommended to that great encourager of learning , Elizabeth Countess of Kent , where he had not only the opportunity to consult all manner of learned books , but to converse also with that living library of learning , the great Mr Selden .</p>
   <p>Our Author lived some time also with Sir Samuel Luke , who was of an ancient family in Bedfordshire but , to his dishonour , an eminent commander under the usurper Oliver Cromwell : and then it was , as I am informed , he composed this loyal Poem . For , though fate , more than choice , seems to have placed him in the service of a Knight so notorious , both in his person and politics , yet , by the rule of contraries , one may observe throughout his whole Poem , that he was most orthodox , both in his religion and loyalty . And I am the more induced to believe he wrote it about that time , because he had then the opportunity to converse with those living characters of rebellion , nonsense , and hypocrisy , which he so livelily and pathetically exposes throughout the whole work .</p>
   <p>After the restoration of King Charles II . those who were at the helm , minding money more than merit , our Author found that verse in Juvenal to be exactly verified in himself :</p>
   <p>Haud facile emergunt , quorum virtutibus obstat Res angusta domi : [ They do not easily rise whose virtues are held back by the straitened circumstances of their home ]</p>
   <p>And being endued with that innate modesty , which rarely finds promotion in princes ’ courts . He became Secretary to Richard Earl of Carbury , Lord President of the Principality of Wales , who made him Steward of Ludlow-Castle , when the Court there was revived . About this time he married one Mrs. Herbert , a gentlewoman of a very good family , but no widow , as the Oxford Antiquary has reported ; she had a competent fortune , but it was most of it unfortunately lost , by being put out on ill securities , so that it was of little advantage to him . He is reported by the Antiquary to have been Secretary to his Grace George Duke of Buckingham , when he was Chancellor to the University of Cambridge ; but whether that be true or no , it is certain , the Duke had a great kindness for him , and was often a benefactor to him . But no man was a more generous friend to him , than that Mecaenas of all learned and witty men , Charles Lord Buckhurst , the late Earl of Dorset and Middlesex , who , being himself an excellent poet , knew how to set a just value upon the ingenious performances of others , and has often taken care privately to relieve and supply the necessities of those , whose modesty would endeavour to conceal them ; of which our author was a signal instance , as several others have been , who are now living . In fine the integrity of his life , the acuteness of his wit , and easiness of his conversation , had rendered him most acceptable to all men ; yet he prudently avoided a multiplicity of acquaintance , and wisely chose such only whom his discerning judgment could distinguish ( as Mr. Cowley expresseth it )</p>
   <p>From the great vulgar or the small .</p>
   <p>And having thus lived to a good old age , admired by all , though personally known to few , he departed this life in the year 1680 , and was buried at the charge of his good friend Mr. Longuevil , of the Temple , in the yard belonging to the church of St. Paul 's Covent-garden , at the west-end of the said yard , on the north side , under the wall of the said church , and under that wall which parts the yard from the common highway . And since he has no monument yet set up for him , give me leave to borrow his epitaph from that of Michael Drayton , the poet , as the author of Mr. Cowley 's has partly done before me :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">And though no monument can claim</l>
     <l n="2">To be the treasurer of thy name ;</l>
     <l n="3">This work , which ne'er will die , shall be</l>
     <l n="4">An everlasting monument to thee .</l>

     <l n="7">When civil dudgeon &lt; a > first grew high ,</l>

     <l n="9">When hard words , jealousies , and fears ,</l>
     <l n="10">Set folks together by the ears ,</l>
     <l n="11">And made them fight , like mad or drunk , 5</l>
     <l n="12">For Dame Religion , as for punk ;</l>
     <l n="13">Whose honesty they all durst swear for ,</l>
     <l n="14">Though not a man of them knew wherefore :</l>

     <l n="17">And pulpit , drum ecclesiastick ,</l>
     <l n="18">Was beat with fist , instead of a stick ;</l>
     <l n="19">Then did Sir Knight abandon dwelling ,</l>
     <l n="20">And out he rode a colonelling .</l>
     <l n="21">A wight he was , whose very sight wou 'd 15</l>
     <l n="22">Entitle him Mirror of Knighthood ;</l>
     <l n="23">That never bent his stubborn knee</l>
     <l n="24">To any thing but Chivalry ;</l>
     <l n="25">Nor put up blow , but that which laid</l>
     <l n="26">Right worshipful on shoulder-blade ; 20</l>
     <l n="27">Chief of domestic knights and errant ,</l>
     <l n="28">Either for cartel or for warrant ;</l>
     <l n="29">Great on the bench , great in the saddle ,</l>
     <l n="30">That &lt; b > could as well bind o'er , as swaddle ;</l>
     <l n="31">Mighty he was at both of these , 25</l>
     <l n="32">And styl 'd of war , as well as peace .</l>
     <l n="33">( So some rats , of amphibious nature ,</l>
     <l n="34">Are either for the land or water ) .</l>
     <l n="35">But here our authors make a doubt</l>
     <l n="36">Whether he were more wise , or stout : 30</l>
     <l n="37">Some hold the one , and some the other ;</l>
     <l n="38">But howsoe'er they make a pother ,</l>
     <l n="39">The diff'rence was so small , his brain</l>
     <l n="40">Outweigh 'd his rage but half a grain ;</l>
     <l n="41">Which made some take him for a tool 35</l>
     <l n="42">That knaves do work with , call 'd a fool ,</l>

     <l n="47">( For that 's the name our valiant knight</l>
     <l n="48">To all his challenges did write ) .</l>
     <l n="49">But they 're mistaken very much ,</l>
     <l n="50">‘ Tis plain enough he was no such ;</l>
     <l n="51">We grant , although he had much wit , 45</l>
     <l n="52">H ’ was very shy of using it ;</l>
     <l n="53">As being loth to wear it out ,</l>
     <l n="54">And therefore bore it not about ,</l>
     <l n="55">Unless on holy-days , or so ,</l>
     <l n="56">As men their best apparel do . 50</l>
     <l n="57">Beside , ‘ tis known he could speak GREEK</l>
     <l n="58">As naturally as pigs squeek ;</l>
     <l n="59">That LATIN was no more difficile ,</l>
     <l n="60">Than to a blackbird ‘ tis to whistle :</l>
     <l n="61">Being rich in both , he never scanted 55</l>
     <l n="62">His bounty unto such as wanted ;</l>
     <l n="63">But much of either would afford</l>
     <l n="64">To many , that had not one word .</l>
     <l n="65">For Hebrew roots , although they 're found</l>
     <l n="66">To flourish most in barren ground , 60</l>
     <l n="67">He had such plenty , as suffic 'd</l>
     <l n="68">To make some &lt; d > think him circumcis 'd ;</l>
     <l n="69">And truly so , he was , perhaps ,</l>
     <l n="70">Not as a proselyte , but for claps .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="71">He was in LOGIC a great critic , 65</l>
     <l n="72">Profoundly skill 'd in &lt; e > analytic ;</l>
     <l n="73">He could distinguish , and divide</l>
     <l n="74">A hair ‘ twixt south , and south-west side :</l>
     <l n="75">On either which he would dispute ,</l>
     <l n="76">Confute , change hands , and still confute , 70</l>
     <l n="77">He 'd undertake to prove , by force</l>
     <l n="78">Of argument , a man 's no horse ;</l>
     <l n="79">He 'd prove a buzzard is no fowl ,</l>
     <l n="80">And that a lord may be an owl ,</l>
     <l n="81">A calf an alderman , a goose a justice , 75</l>
     <l n="82">And rooks Committee-men and Trustees .</l>
     <l n="83">He 'd run in debt by disputation ,</l>
     <l n="84">And pay with ratiocination .</l>
     <l n="85">All this by syllogism , true</l>
     <l n="86">In mood and figure , he would do . 80</l>
     <l n="87">For RHETORIC , he could not ope</l>
     <l n="88">His mouth , but out there flew a trope ;</l>
     <l n="89">And when he happen 'd to break off</l>
     <l n="90">I ’ th ’ middle of his speech , or cough ,</l>
     <l n="91">H ’ had hard words , ready to show why , 85</l>
     <l n="92">And tell what rules he did it by ;</l>
     <l n="93">Else , when with greatest art he spoke ,</l>
     <l n="94">You 'd think he talk 'd like other folk ,</l>
     <l n="95">For all a rhetorician 's rules</l>
     <l n="96">Teach nothing but to name his tools . 90</l>
     <l n="97">His ordinary rate of speech</l>
     <l n="98">In loftiness of sound was rich ;</l>
     <l n="99">A Babylonish &lt; f > dialect ,</l>
     <l n="100">Which learned pedants much affect .</l>
     <l n="101">It was a parti-colour 'd dress 95</l>
     <l n="102">Of patch 'd and pie-bald languages ;</l>
     <l n="103">‘ Twas English cut on Greek and Latin ,</l>
     <l n="104">Like fustian heretofore on satin ;</l>
     <l n="105">It had an odd promiscuous tone ,</l>
     <l n="106">As if h ’ had talk 'd three parts in one ; 100</l>
     <l n="107">Which made some think , when he did gabble ,</l>
     <l n="108">Th ’ had heard three labourers of Babel ;</l>
     <l n="109">Or &lt; g > CERBERUS himself pronounce</l>
     <l n="110">A leash of languages at once .</l>
     <l n="111">This he as volubly would vent 105</l>
     <l n="112">As if his stock would ne'er be spent :</l>
     <l n="113">And truly , to support that charge ,</l>
     <l n="114">He had supplies as vast and large ;</l>
     <l n="115">For he cou 'd coin , or counterfeit</l>
     <l n="116">New words , with little or no wit : 110</l>
     <l n="117">Words so debas 'd and hard , no stone</l>
     <l n="118">Was hard enough to touch them on ;</l>
     <l n="119">And when with hasty noise he spoke ‘ em ,</l>
     <l n="120">The ignorant for current took ‘ em ;</l>
     <l n="121">That had the &lt; h > orator , who once 115</l>
     <l n="122">Did fill his mouth with pebble stones</l>
     <l n="123">When he harangu 'd , but known his phrase</l>
     <l n="124">He would have us 'd no other ways .</l>
     <l n="125">In MATHEMATICKS he was greater</l>
     <l n="126">Than &lt; i > TYCHO BRAHE , or ERRA PATER : 120</l>
     <l n="127">For he , by geometric scale ,</l>
     <l n="128">Could take the size of pots of ale ;</l>
     <l n="129">Resolve , by sines and tangents straight ,</l>
     <l n="130">If bread or butter wanted weight ,</l>
     <l n="131">And wisely tell what hour o ’ th ’ day 125</l>
     <l n="132">The clock does strike by algebra .</l>
     <l n="133">Beside , he was a shrewd PHILOSOPHER ,</l>
     <l n="134">And had read ev'ry text and gloss over ;</l>
     <l n="135">Whate'er the crabbed'st author hath ,</l>
     <l n="136">He understood b ’ implicit faith : 130</l>
     <l n="137">Whatever &lt; k > sceptic could inquire for ,</l>
     <l n="138">For ev'ry why he had a wherefore ;</l>
     <l n="139">Knew more than forty of them do ,</l>
     <l n="140">As far as words and terms cou 'd go .</l>
     <l n="141">All which he understood by rote , 135</l>
     <l n="142">And , as occasion serv 'd , would quote ;</l>
     <l n="143">No matter whether right or wrong ,</l>
     <l n="144">They might be either said or sung .</l>
     <l n="145">His notions fitted things so well ,</l>
     <l n="146">That which was which he could not tell ; 140</l>
     <l n="147">But oftentimes mistook th ’ one</l>
     <l n="148">For th ’ other , as great clerks have done .</l>
     <l n="149">He could &lt; l > reduce all things to acts ,</l>
     <l n="150">And knew their natures by abstracts ;</l>
     <l n="151">Where entity and quiddity , 145</l>
     <l n="152">The ghosts of defunct bodies fly ;</l>
     <l n="153">Where &lt; m > truth in person does appear ,</l>
     <l n="154">Like words &lt; n > congeal 'd in northern air .</l>
     <l n="155">He knew what 's what , and that 's as high</l>
     <l n="156">As metaphysic wit can fly ; 150</l>
     <l n="157">In school-divinity as able</l>
     <l n="158">As &lt; o > he that hight , Irrefragable ;</l>
     <l n="159">A second &lt; p > THOMAS , or , at once ,</l>
     <l n="160">To name them all , another DUNCE :</l>
     <l n="161">Profound in all the Nominal 155</l>
     <l n="162">And Real ways , beyond them all :</l>
     <l n="163">For he a rope of sand cou 'd twist</l>
     <l n="164">As &lt; q > tough as learned SORBONIST ;</l>
     <l n="165">And weave fine cobwebs , fit for skull</l>
     <l n="166">That 's empty when the moon is full ; 160</l>
     <l n="167">Such as take lodgings in a head</l>
     <l n="168">That 's to be let unfurnished .</l>
     <l n="169">He could raise scruples dark and nice ,</l>
     <l n="170">And after solve ‘ em in a trice ;</l>
     <l n="171">As if Divinity had catch 'd 165</l>
     <l n="172">The itch , on purpose to be scratch 'd ;</l>
     <l n="173">Or , like a mountebank , did wound</l>
     <l n="174">And stab herself with doubts profound ,</l>
     <l n="175">Only to show with how small pain</l>
     <l n="176">The sores of Faith are cur 'd again ; 170</l>
     <l n="177">Although by woeful proof we find ,</l>
     <l n="178">They always leave a scar behind .</l>

   <p>The Heathens had an odd opinion , and have a strange reason why Moses imposed the law of circumcision on the Jews , which , how untrue soever , I will give the learned reader an account of without translation , as I find it in the annotations upon Horace , wrote by my worthy and learned friend Mr. William Baxter , the great restorer of the ancient and promoter of modern learning . Hor . Sat . 9 . Sermon . Lib . I . — Curtis ; quia pellicula imminuti sunt ; quia Moses Rex Judoeorum , cujus Legibus reguntur , negligentia PHIMOZEIS medicinaliter exsectus est , &amp; ne soles esset notabi omnes circumcidi voluit . Vet . Schol . Vocem . — ( PHIMOZEIS qua inscitia Librarii exciderat reposuimus ex conjectura , uti &amp; medicinaliter exsectus pro medicinalis effectus quae nihil erant . ) Quis miretur ejusmodi convicia homini Epicureo atque Pagano excidisse ? Jure igitur Henrico Glareano Diaboli Organum videtur . Etiam Satyra Quinta haec habet : Constat omnia miracula certa ratione fieri , de quibus Epicurei prudentissime disputant . [ Circumcised : Moses the King of the Jews , by whose laws they are ruled , and whose foreskin overhung ( the tip of his penis ) , had this blockage carelessly medicinally removed , and not wishing to be alone wanted them all to be circumcised . ( We have tentatively restored the word BLOCKAGE , which the scribe 's incompetence has omitted , and substituted medically removed for carried out by a doctor which was never there . ) Who shall wonder that this kind of cutting caused an outcry by Epicureans and Pagans ? It can be seen therefore , why Henricus Glareanus judged it an implement of the devil . So the Fifth Satire has it : It is certain that every miracle can be fitted into the philosophical systems which the Epicureans most carefully discuss . ]</p>
   <p>66 e Profoundly skill 'd , &amp; c .] Analytick is a part of logic , that teaches to decline and construe reason , as grammar does words .</p>

   <p>103 g Or CERBERUS himself , &amp; c .] Cerberus ; a name which poets give a dog with three heads , which they feigned door - keeper of Hell , that caressed the unfortunate souls sent thither , and devoured them that would get out again ; yet Hercules tied him up , and made him follow . This dog with three heads denotes the past , the present , and the time to come ; which receive , and , as it were , devour all things . Hercules got the better of him , which shews that heroic actions are always victorious over time , because they are present in the memory of posterity .</p>
   <p>115 h That had the , &amp; c .] Demosthenes , who is said to have had a defect in his pronunciation , which he cured by using to speak with little stones in his mouth .</p>
   <p>120 i Than TYCHO BRAHE , &amp; c .] Tycho Brahe was an eminent Danish mathematician . Quer . in Collier 's Dictionary , or elsewhere .</p>
   <p>131 k Whatever Sceptick , &amp; c .] Sceptick . Pyrrho was the chief of the Sceptick Philosophers , and was at first , as Apollodorus saith , a painter , then became the hearer of Driso , and at last the disciple of Anaxagoras , whom he followed into India , to see the Gymnosophists . He pretended that men did nothing but by custom ; there was neither honesty nor dishonesty , justice nor injustice , good nor evil . He was very solitary , lived to be ninety years old , was highly esteemed in his country , and created chief priest . He lived in the time of Epicurus and Theophrastus , about the 120th Olympiad . His followers were called Phyrrhonians ; besides which they were named the Ephecticks and Aphoreticks , but more generally Scepticks . This sect made their chiefest good to consist in a sedateness of mind , exempt from all passions ; in regulating their opinions , and moderating their passions , which they called Ataxia and Metriopathia ; and in suspending their judgment in regard of good and evil , truth or falsehood , which they called Epechi . Sextus Empiricus , who lived in the second century , under the Emperor Antoninus Pius , writ ten books against the mathematicians or astrologers , and three of the Phyrrhonian opinion . The word is derived from the Greek SKEPTESZAI , quod est , considerare , speculare . [ To consider or speculate ]</p>
   <p>143 l He cou 'd reduce , &amp; c .] The old philosophers thought to extract notions out of natural things , as chymists do spirits and essences ; and , when they had refined them into the nicest subtilties , gave them as insignificant names as those operators do their extractions : But ( as Seneca says ) the subtiler things are they are but the nearer to nothing . So are all their definitions of things by acts the nearer to nonsense .</p>
   <p>147 m Where Truth , &amp; c .] Some authors have mistaken truth for a real thing , when it is nothing but a right method of putting those notions or images of things ( in the understanding of man ) into the same and order that their originals hold in nature , and therefore Aristotle says Unumquodque sicut habet secundum esse , ita se habet secundum veritatem .

   <p>153 p A Second THOMAS or at once , To name them all , another DUNCE . Thomas Aquinas , a Dominican friar , was born in 1224 , and studied at Cologne and Paris . He new modelled the school - divinity , and was therefore called the Angelic Doctor , and Eagle of Divines . The most illustrious persons of his time were ambitious of his friendship , and put a high value on his merits , so that they offered him bishopricks , which he refused with as much ardor as others seek after them . He died in the fiftieth year of his age , and was canonized by Pope John XII . We have his works in eighteen volumes , several times printed .</p>
   <p>Johannes Dunscotus was a very learned man , who lived about the end of the thirteenth and beginning of the fourteenth century . The English and Scotch strive which of them shall have the honour of his birth . The English say , he was born in Northumberland : the Scots alledge he was born at Duns , in the Mers , the neighbouring county to Northumberland , and hence was called Dunscotus . Moreri , Buchanan , and other Scotch historians , are of this opinion , and for proof cite his epitaph :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Scotia me genuit , Anglia suscepit ,</l>
     <l n="2">Gallia edocuit , Germania tenet .</l>
     <l n="3">[ Scotland bore me , England reared me ,</l>

   <p>He died at Cologne , Novem . 8 . 1308 . In the Supplement to Dr. Cave 's Historia Literaria , he is said to be extraordinary learned in physicks , metaphysicks , mathematicks , and astronomy ; that his fame was so great when at Oxford , that 30 , 000 scholars came thither to hear his lectures : that when at Paris , his arguments and authority carried it for the immaculate conception of the Blessed Virgin ; so that they appointed a festival on that account , and would admit us scholars to degrees but such as were of this mind . He was a great opposer of Thomas Aquinas 's doctrine ; and , for being a very acute logician , was called Doctor Subtilis ; [ Discriminating ( or , literally , Slender ) Teacher ] which was the reason also , that an old punster always called him the Lathy Doctor .</p>
   <p>158 q As tough as , &amp; c .] Sorbon was the first and most considerable college of the university of Paris , founded in time reign of St. Lewis , by Robert Sorbon , which name is sometimes given to the whole University of Paris , which was founded , about the year 741 , by Charlemagne , at the persuasion of the learned Alcuinus , who was one of the first professors there ; since which time it has been very famous . This college has been rebuilt with an extraordinary magnificence , at the charge of Cardinal Richlieu , and contains lodgings for thirty-six doctors , who are called the Society of Sorbon . Those which are received among them before they have received their doctor 's degree are only said to be of the Hospitality of Sorbon . Claud . Hemeraus de Acad . Paris . Spondan in Annal .</p>
   <p>173 r he knew , &amp; c .] There is nothing more ridiculous than the various opinions of authors about the seat of Paradise . Sir . Walter Raleigh has taken a great deal of pains to collect them , in the beginning of his History of the World ; where those , who are unsatisfied , may be fully informed .</p>
   <p>180 s By a High-Dutch , &amp; c .] Goropius Becanus endeavours to prove that High-Dutch was the language that Adam and Eve spoke in Paradise .</p>
   <p>181 t If either of &amp; c .] Adam and Eve being made , and not conceived and formed in the womb had no navels as some learned men have supposed , because they had no need of them .</p>
   <p>182 u Who first made , &amp; c .] Musick is said to be invented by Pythagoras , who first found out the proportion of notes from the sounds of hammers upon an anvil</p>
   <p>232 w Like MAHOMET 's &amp; c .) Mahomet had a tame dove , that used to pick seeds out of his ear that it might be thought to whisper and inspire him . His ass was so intimate with him , that the Mahometans believed it carried him to heaven , and stays there with him to bring him back again .</p>
   <p>257 x It was Monastick , and did grow In holy Orders by strict Vow . He made a vow never to cut his beard until the Parliament had subdued the King ; of which order of phanatick votaries there were many in those times .</p>
   <p>281 y So learned TALIACOTIUS &amp; c .] Taliacotius was an Italian surgeon , that found out a way to repair lost and decayed noses . This Taliacotius was chief surgeon to the Great Duke of Tuscany , and wrote a treatise , De Curtis Membris , [ Of Cut-off Parts ] which he dedicates to his great master wherein he not only declares the models of his wonderful operations in restoring of lost members , but gives you cuts of the very instruments and ligatures he made use of therein ; from hence our Author ( cum poetica licentia [ with poetic licence ]) has taken his simile .</p>
   <p>289 z For as AENEAS , &amp; c .] AEneas was the son of Anchises and Venus ; a Trojan , who , after long travels , came to Italy , and after the death of his father-in-law , Latinus , was made king of Latium , and reigned three years . His story is too long to insert here , and therefore I refer you to Virgil 's AEneids . Troy being laid in ashes , he took his aged father Anchises upon his back , and rescued him from his enemies . But being too solicitous for his son and household gods , he lost his wife Creusa ; which Mr. Dryden , in his excellent translation , thus expresseth .</p>

   <p>337 a — For ARTHUR , &amp; c .] Who this Arthur was and whether any ever reigned in Britain , has been doubted heretofore , and is by some to this very day . However , the history of him , which makes him one of the nine worthies of the world , is a subject , sufficient for the Poet to be pleasant upon .</p>
   <p>359 b — Toledo trusty , &amp; c .] The capital city of New Castile , Spain , with an archbishopric and primacy . It was very famous , amongst other things , for tempering the best metal for swords , as Damascus was and perhaps may be still .</p>
   <p>389 c But left the trade , as many more Have lately done , &amp; c. Oliver Cromwell and Colonel Pride had been both brewers .</p>
   <p>433 d That CAESAR 's Horse , who , as Fame goes , Had corns upon his Feet and Toes . Julius Caesar had a horse with feet like a man 's . Utebatur equo insigni ; pedibus prope humanis , modum digitorum ungulis fissis . [ He rode a horse with this distinction ; it had feet like a man 's , having the hooves split like toes ] Suet . in Jul . Cap . 61 .</p>
   <p>467 c The mighty Tyrian Queen , that gain 'd With subtle Shreds a Tract of Land . Dido , Queen of Carthage , who bought as much land as she could compass with an ox 's hide , which she cut into small thongs , and cheated the owner of so much ground as served her to build Carthage upon .</p>
   <p>476 f As the bold , &amp; c .] AEneas , whom Virgil reports to use a golden bough for a pass to hell ; and taylors call that place Hell where they put all they steal .</p>
   <p>526 g As three , &amp; c .] Read the great Geographical Dictionary , under that word .</p>
   <p>520 h In Magick , &amp; c .] Talisman is a device to destroy any sort of vermin , by casting their images in metal , in a precise minute , when the stars are perfectly inclined to do them all the mischief they can . This has been experienced by some modern Virtuosi upon rats , mice , and fleas , and found ( as they affirm ) to produce the effect with admirable success .</p>
   <p>Raymund Lully interprets cabal , out of the Arabic , to signify Scientia superabundans ; which his commentator , Cornelius Agrippa , by over-magnifying , has rendered a very superfluous foppery .</p>
   <p>532 i As far as , &amp; c .] The author of Magia Adamica endeavours to prove the learning of the ancient Magi to be derived from that knowledge which God himself taught Adam in Paradise before the fall .</p>

     <l n="1">535 And much of Terra Incognita ,</l>

     <l n="3">The intelligible world is a kind of Terra Del Fuego , or</l>
     <l n="4">Psittacorum Regio [ Land of Parrots ] , &amp; c. discovered only by the</l>

   <p>539 l Or Sir AGRIPPA , &amp; c .] They who would know more of Sir Cornelius Agrippa , here meant , may consult the Great Dictionary .</p>
   <p>541 m He ANTHROPOSOPHUS and FLOUD , And JACOB BEHMEN understood . Anthroposophus is only a compound Greek word , which signifies a man that is wise in the knowledge of men , as is used by some anonymous author to conceal his true name . Dr. Floud was a sort of an English Rosy-crucian , whose works are extant , and as intelligible as those of Jacob Behmen .</p>
   <p>545 n In ROSY-CRUCIAN Lore as learned As he that Vere Adeptus earned . The fraternity of the Rosy-crucians is very like the sect of the ancient Gnostici , who called them selves so from the excellent learning they pretended to , although they were really the most ridiculous sots of mankind . Vere Adeptus is one that has commenced in their phanatick extravagance .</p>
   <p>646 o Thou that with Ale or viler Liquors , Didst inspire WITHERS , PRYN , and VICARS . This Vicars was a man of as great interest and authority in the late Reformation as Pryn or Withers , and as able a poet . He translated Virgil 's AEneids into as horrible Travesty , in earnest , as the French Scaroon did in burlesque , and was only outdone in his way by the politic author of Oceana .</p>
   <p>714 p We that are , &amp; c .] This speech is set down as it was delivered by the Knight , in his own words : But since it is below the gravity of heroical poetry to admit of humour , but all men are obliged to speak wisely alike , and too much of so extravagant a folly would become tedious and impertinent , the rest of his harangues have only his sense expressed in other words , unless in some few places , where his own words could not be so well avoided .</p>
   <p>753 q In bloody , &amp; c .] Cynarctomachy signifies no thing in the world but a fight between dogs and bears ; though both the learned and ignorant agree that in such words very great knowledge is contained : And our Knight , as one , or both , of these , was of the same opinion .</p>
   <p>758 r Or Force , &amp; c .] Averruncate : Another of the same kind , which , though it appear ever so learned and profound , means nothing else but the weeding of corn .</p>
   <p>777 s The Indians fought for the Truth Of th ’ Elephant and Monkey 's Tooth . The History of the White Elephant and the Monkey'shYpppHeNTooth , which the Indians adored , is written by Mons . le Blanc . This monkey 's tooth was taken by the Portuguese from those that worshipped it ; and though they offered a vast ransom for it , yet the Christians were persuaded by their priests rather to burn it . But as soon as the fire was kindled , all the people present were not able to endure the horrible stink that came from it , as if the fire had been made of the same ingredients with which seamen use to compose that kind of granados which they call stinkards .</p>
   <p>786 t The Rage , &amp; c .] Boute-feus is a French word , and therefore it were uncivil to suppose any English person ( especially of quality ) ignorant of it , or so ill-bred as to need an exposition .</p>
   <p>903 u ‘ Tis sung , &amp; c .] Mamaluke is the name of the militia of the Sultans of Egypt . It signified a servant or soldier . They were commonly captives taken from amongst the Christians , and instructed in military discipline , and did not marry . Their power was great ; for besides that the Sultans were chosen out of their body , they disposed of the most important offices of the kingdom . They were formidable about 200 years ; ‘ till at last Selim , Sultan of the Turks , routed them , and killed their Sultan , near Aleppo , 1516 , and so put an end to the empire of Mamalukes , which had lasted 267 years . No question but the rhime to Mamaluke was meant Sir Samuel Luke , of whom in the Preface .</p>
   <p>913 w Honour is like , &amp; c .] Our English proverbs are not impertinent to this purpose :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">He that woos a Maid , must seldom come in her sight :</l>
     <l n="2">But he that woos a Widow , must woo her Day and Night .</l>
     <l n="3">He that woos a Maid , must feign , lye , and flatter :</l>
     <l n="4">But he that woos a Widow , must down with his Breeches , and at her .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>This proverb being somewhat immodest , Mr Ray says he would not have inserted it in his collection , but that he met with it in a little book , intitled , the Quakers ’ Spiritual Court Proclaimed ; written by Nathaniel Smith , Student in Physic ; wherein the author mentions it as counsel given him by Hilkiah Bedford , an eminent Quaker in London , who would have had him to have married a rich widow , in whose house he lodged . In case he could get her , this Nathaniel Smith had promised Hilkiah a chamber gratis . The whole narrative is worth the reading .</p>

   <p>47 x That is to say , whether Tollulation , As they do term't , or Succussation . Tollulation and succussation are only Latin words for ambling and trotting ; though I believe both were natural amongst the old Romans ; since I never read they made use of the trammel , or any other art , to pace their horses .</p>
   <p>60 y As Indian Britons , &amp; c .] The American Indians call a great bird they have , with a white head , a penguin , which signifies the same thing in the British tongue : from whence ( with other words of the same kind ) some authors have endeavoured to prove , that the Americans are originally derived from the Britons .</p>

   <p>129 a Chiron , the &amp; c .] Chiron , a Centaur , son to Saturn and Phillyris , living in the mountains , where , being much given to hunting , he became very knowing in the virtues of plants and one of the most famous physicians of his time . He imparted his skill to AEsculapius and was afterwards Apollo 's governor , until being wounded by Hercules , and desiring to die , Jupiter placed him in heaven , where he forms the sign of Sagittarius or the Archer .</p>

Prometheus was the son of Iapetus , and brother of Atlas , concerning whom the poets have feigned , that having first formed men of the earth and water , he stole fire from heaven to put life into them ; and that having thereby displeased Jupiter , he commanded Vulcan to tie him to mount Caucasus with iron chains , and that a vulture should prey upon his liver continually : but the truth of the story is , that Prometheus was an astrologer , and constant in observing the stars upon that mountain ; and , that , among other things , he found the art of making fire , either by the means of a flint , or by contracting the sun-beams in a glass . Bochart will have Magog , in the Scripture , to be the Prometheus of the Pagans .</p>
   <p>He here and before sarcastically derides those who were great admirers of the sympathetic powder and weapon salve , which were in great repute in those days , and much promoted by the great Sir Kenelm Digby , who wrote a treatise ex professo [ of his own knowledge ] on that subject , and , I believe , thought what he wrote to be true , which since has been almost exploded out of the world .</p>
   <p>267 And ‘ mong , &amp; c .] Cossacks are a people that live near Poland . This name was given them for their extraordinary nimbleness ; for cosa , or kosa , in the Polish tongue , signifies a goat . He that would know more of them , may read Le Laboreur and Thuldenus .</p>

The Story in Le Blanc , of a bear that married a king 's daughter , is no more strange than many others , in most travellers , that pass with allowance ; for if they should write nothing but what is possible , or probable , they might appear to have lost their labour , and observed nothing but what they might have done as well at home .</p>

   <p>385 f They wou 'd not suffer the stout'st Dame To swear by HERCULES 's Name . The old Romans had particular oaths for men and women to swear by , and therefore Macrobius says , Viri per Castorum non jurabant antiquitus , nec Mulieres per Herculem ; AEdepol autem juramentum erat tum mulieribus , quam viris commune , &amp; c.

   <p>395 h Of GUNDIBERT &amp; c .] Gundibert is a feigned name , made use of by Sir William d ’ Avenant in his famous epic poem , so called ; wherein you may find also that of his mistress . This poem was designed by the author to be an imitation of the English Drama : it being divided into five books , as the other is into five acts ; the Cantos to be parallel of the scenes , with this difference , that this is delivered narratively , the other dialoguewise . It was ushered into the world by a large preface , written by Mr. Hobbes , and by the pens of two of our best poets , viz . Mr. Waller and Mr. Cowley , which one would have thought might have proved a sufficient defence and protection against snarling critics . Notwithstanding which , four eminent wits of that age ( two of which were Sir John Denham and Mr. Donne ) published several copies of verses to Sir William 's discredit , under this title , Certain Verses written by several of the Author 's Friends , to be reprinted with the second Edition of Gundibert in 8vo . Lond . 1653 . These verses were as wittily answered by the author , under this title , The incomparable Poem of Gundibert vindicated from the Wit Combat of four Esquires , Clinias , Damoetas , Sancho , and Jack-Pudding ; printed in 8vo . Lond . 1665 , Vide Langbain 's Account of Dramatic Poets .</p>

   <p>525 k Wore in their Hats , &amp; c .] Some few days after the King had accus 'd the five Members of Treason in the House of Commons , great Crowds of the rabble came down to Westminster-Hall , with printed copies of the Protestation tied in their hats like favours .</p>
   <p>526 l When ‘ twas resolv 'd by either House Six Members Quarrel to espouse . The six Members were the Lord Kimbolton , Mr. Pym , Mr. Hollis , Mr. Hampden , Sir Arthur Haslerig , and Mr. Stroud , whom the King ordered to be apprehended , and their papers seized ; charging them of plotting with the Scots , and favouring the late tumults ; but the House voted against the arrest of their persons or papers ; whereupon the King having preferred articles against those Members , he went with his guard to the House to demand them ; but they , having notice , withdrew .</p>

   <p>650 n And is indeed the self same Case With theirs that swore t ’ Et caeteras . The Convocation , in one of the short Parliaments , that ushered in the long one , ( as dwarfs are wont to do knights-errant ,) made an oath to be taken by the clergy for observing canonical obedience ; in which they enjoined their brethren , out of the abundance of their consciences , to swear to articles with , &amp; c .</p>

The Holy League in France , designed and made for the extirpation of the Protestant Religion , was the original out of which the Solemn League and Covenant here was ( with the difference only of circumstances ) most faithfully transcribed . Nor did the success of both differ more than the intent and purpose ; for after the destruction of vast numbers of people of all sorts , both ended with the murder of two Kings , whom they had both sworn to defend : And as our Covenanters swore every man to run one before another in the way of Reformation , so did the French , in the Holy League , to fight to the last drop of blood .</p>

   <p>NOTES TO PART I. CANTO III .</p>
   <p>134 p First TRULLA stav 'd , &amp; c .] Staving and Tailing are terms of art used in the Bear-Garden , and signify there only the parting of dogs and bears : Though they are used metaphorically in several other professions , for moderating ; as law , divinity , hectoring , &amp; c .</p>
   <p>153 q Or like the late corrected leathern Ears of the Circumcised Brethren . Pryn , Bastwick , and Burton , who laid down their ears as proxies for their profession of the godly party , not long after maintained their right and title to the pillory to be as good and lawful as theirs who first of all took possession of it in their names .</p>
   <p>328 r That old , &amp; c .] Pygmalion , king of Tyre , was the son of Margenus , or Mechres , whom he succeeded , and lived 56 years , wherof he reigned 47 . Dido , his sister , was to have governed with him , but it was pretended the subjects thought it not convenient . She married Sichaeus , who was the king 's uncle , and very rich ; wherefore he put him to death ; and Dido soon after departed the kingdom . Poets say , Pygmalion was punished for the hatred he bore to women with the love he had to a statue .</p>
   <p>925 s And as the FRENCH we conquer 'd once , Now give us Laws for PANTALOONS , &amp; c. Pantaloons and Port-Cannons were some of the fantastick fashions wherein we aped the French .</p>

     <l n="1">At quisquis Insula satus Britannica</l>
     <l n="2">Sic patria insolens fastidiet suam ,</l>
     <l n="3">Ut more simiae laboret fingere ,</l>
     <l n="4">Et aemulari Gallicas ineptias ,</l>
     <l n="5">Et omni Gallo ego hunc opinor ebrium ;</l>

   <p>THOMAS MORE .</p>
   <p>Gallus is a river in Phrygia ; rising out of the mountains of Celenae , and discharging itself into the river Sanger , the water of which is of that admirable quality , that , being moderately drank , it purges the brain , and cures madness ; but largely drank , it makes men frantick . Pliny , Horatius .</p>
   <p>1123 t A learned divine in King James 's time wrote a polemick work against the Pope , and gave it that unlucky nick-name of The Pope 's Bull baited .</p>
   <p>1166 u Canonical Cravat , &amp; c .] Smectymnuus was a club of five parlimentary holders-forth ; the characters of whose names and talents were by themselves expressed in that senseless and insignificant word . They wore handkerchiefs about their necks for a mark of distinction ( as the Officers of the Parliament Army then did ) which afterwards degenerated into carnal cravats . About the beginning of the long Parliament , in the year 1641 , these five wrote a book against Episcopacy and the Common Prayer , to which they all subscribed their names ; being Stephen Marshal , Edmund Calamy , Thomas Young , Matthew Newcomen , and William Spurstow , and from thence they and their followers were called Smectymnians . They are remarkable for another pious book , which they wrote some time after that , intitled , The Kings Cabinet unlocked , wherein all the chaste and endearing expressions , in the letters that passed betwixt his Majesty King Charles I. and his Royal Consort are by these painful labourers in the Devil 's vineyard turned into burlesque and ridicule . Their books were answered with as much calmness and genteelness of expression , and as much learning and honesty , b. the Rev . Mr. Symonds , then a deprived clergyman , as theirs was stuffed with malice , spleen , and rascally invectives .</p>
   <p>1249 x So Cardinals they say do grope At t'other end the new-made Pope . This relates to the story of Pope Joan , who was called John VIII . Platina saith she was of English extraction , but born at Mentz ; who , having disguised herself like a man , travelled with her paramour to Athens , where she made such progress in learning , that coming to Rome , she met with few that could equal her ; so that , on the death of Pope Leo IV . she was chosen to succeed him ; but being got with child by one of her domesticks , her travail came upon her between the Colossian Theatre and St. Clement 's , as she was going to the Lateran Church , and died upon the place , having sat two years , one month , and four days , and was buried there without any pomp . He owns that , for the shame of this , the Popes decline going through this street to the Lateran ; and that , to avoid the like error , when any Pope is placed in the Porphyry Chair , his genitals are felt by the youngest deacon , through a hole made for that purpose ; but he supposes the reason of that to he , to put him in mind that he is a man , and obnoxious to the necessities of nature ; whence he will have the seat to be called , Sedes Stercoraria .</p>
   <p>1262 y To leave your Vitiligation , &amp; c .] Vitilitigation is a word the Knight was passionately in love with , and never failed to use it upon all occasions ; and therefore to omit it , when it fell in the way , bad argued too great a neglect of his learning and parts ; though it means no more than a perverse humour of wrangling .</p>
   <p>1373 z Mere Disparata , &amp; c .] Disparata are things separate and unlike , from the Latin word Disparo .</p>

     <l n="89">Which to mistake , and make ‘ em squabble</l>
     <l n="90">In literal fray 's abominable .</l>
     <l n="91">‘ Tis heathenish , in frequent use 85</l>
     <l n="92">With Pagans and apostate Jews ,</l>
     <l n="93">To offer sacrifice of bridewells ,</l>
     <l n="94">Like modern Indians to their idols ;</l>
     <l n="95">And mongrel Christians of our times ,</l>
     <l n="96">That expiate less with greater crimes , 90</l>
     <l n="97">And call the foul abomination ,</l>
     <l n="98">Contrition and mortification .</l>

     <l n="104">And heathen stripes , by their example ;</l>
     <l n="105">Which ( were there nothing to forbid it )</l>
     <l n="106">Is impious because they did it ; 100</l>
     <l n="107">This , therefore , may be justly reckon 'd</l>
     <l n="108">A heinous sin . Now to the second</l>
     <l n="109">That Saints may claim a dispensation</l>
     <l n="110">To swear and forswear , on occasion ,</l>
     <l n="111">I doubt not but it will appear 105</l>
     <l n="112">With pregnant light : the point is clear .</l>
     <l n="113">Oaths are but words , and words but wind ;</l>
     <l n="114">Too feeble implements to bind ;</l>
     <l n="115">And hold with deeds proportion so</l>
     <l n="116">As shadows to a substance do . 110</l>
     <l n="117">Then when they strive for place , ‘ tis fit</l>
     <l n="118">The weaker vessel should submit .</l>
     <l n="119">Although your Church be opposite</l>
     <l n="120">To ours as Black Friars are to White ,</l>
     <l n="121">In rule and order , yet I grant , 115</l>
     <l n="122">You are a Reformado Saint ;</l>
     <l n="123">And what the Saints do claim as due ,</l>
     <l n="124">You may pretend a title to :</l>
     <l n="125">But Saints whom oaths and vows oblige ,</l>
     <l n="126">Know little of their privilege ; 120</l>
     <l n="127">Further ( I mean ) than carrying on</l>
     <l n="128">Some self-advantage of their own :</l>
     <l n="129">For if the Dev'l , to serve his turn ,</l>
     <l n="130">Can tell troth , why the Saints should scorn ,</l>
     <l n="131">When it serves theirs , to swear and lye ; 125</l>
     <l n="132">I think there 's little reason why :</l>
     <l n="133">Else h ’ has a greater pow'r than they ,</l>
     <l n="134">Which ‘ t were impiety to say .</l>
     <l n="135">W ’ are not commanded to forbear</l>
     <l n="136">Indefinitely at all to swear ; 130</l>
     <l n="137">But to swear idly , and in vain ,</l>
     <l n="138">Without self-interest or gain</l>
     <l n="139">For breaking of an oath , and lying ,</l>
     <l n="140">Is but a kind of self-denying ;</l>
     <l n="141">A Saint-like virtue : and from hence 135</l>
     <l n="142">Some have broke oaths by Providence</l>
     <l n="143">Some , to the glory of the Lord ,</l>
     <l n="144">Perjur 'd themselves , and broke their word ;</l>
     <l n="145">And this the constant rule and practice</l>
     <l n="146">Of all our late Apostles acts is . 140</l>
     <l n="147">Was not the cause at first begun</l>
     <l n="148">With perjury , and carried on ?</l>
     <l n="149">Was there an oath the Godly took ,</l>
     <l n="150">But in due time and place they broke ?</l>
     <l n="151">Did we not bring our oaths in first , 145</l>

     <l n="191">And troll 'd them on , and swore , and swore , 185</l>
     <l n="192">Till th ’ army turn 'd them out of door .</l>
     <l n="193">This tells us plainly what they thought ,</l>

   <p>NOTES TO PART II . CANTO III .</p>
   <p>140 A &lt; w > Ledger , &amp; c .] The Witch-finder in Suffolk , who , in the Presbyterian times , had a commission to discover witches , of whom ( right or wrong ) he caused 60 to be hanged within the compass of year ; and , among the rest , the old minister , who been a painful preacher for many years .</p>
   <p>159 Did he not help the &lt; x > Dutch , &amp; c .] In the beginning of the Civil Wars of Flanders , the common people of Antwerp in a tumult broke open the cathedral church , to demolish images and shrines , and did so much mischief in a small time , that Strada writes , there were several Devils seen very busy among them , otherwise it had been impossible .</p>
   <p>161 &lt; y > Sing catches , &amp; c .] This Devil at Mascon delivered all his oracles , like his forefathers , in verse , which he sung to tunes . He made several lampoons upon the Hugonots , and foretold them many things which afterwards came to pass ; as may be seen his Memoirs , written in French .</p>
   <p>163 &lt; z > Appear 'd in divers , &amp; c .] The History of Dee and the Devil , published by Mer . Casaubon , Isaac Fil . Prebendary of Canterbury , has a large account of all those passages , in which the stile of the true and false angels appears to be penned by one and the same person . The Nun of Loudon , in France , and all her tricks , have been seen by many persons of quality of this nation yet living , who have made very good observations upon the French book written on that occasion .</p>
   <p>165 &lt; a > Met with , &amp; c ] A Committee of the Long Parliament , sitting in the King'shYpppHeNhouse in Woodstock Park , were terrified with several apparitions , the particulars whereof were then the news of the whole nation .</p>
   <p>157 &lt; b > At Sarum , &amp; c .] Withers has a long story , in doggerel , of a soldier in the King 's army , who being a prisoner at Salisbury , and drinking a health to the Devil upon his knees , was carried away by him through a single pane of glass .</p>
   <p>224 Since old &lt; c > Hodge Bacon , &amp; c .] Roger Bacon , commonly called Friar Bacon , lived in the reign of Edward I. and , for some little skill he had in the mathematicks , was by the rabble accounted a conjurer , and had the sottish story of the Brazen Head fathered upon him by the ignorant Monks of those days . Robert Grosthead was Bishop of Lincoln in the of Henry III . He was a learned man for those times , and for that reason suspected by the Clergy to be a Conjurer ; for which crime , being degraded by Innocent IV . and summoned to appear at Rome , appealed to the tribunal of Christ ; which our lawyers say is illegal , if not a Praemunire , for offering to sue in a Foreign Court .</p>

   <p>436 &lt; e > Unless it be , &amp; c .] This experiment was tried by some foreign Virtuosos , who planted a piece of ordnance point-blank against the Zenith , and having fired it , the bullet never rebounded back again ; which made them all conclude that it sticks in the mark : but Des Cartes was of opinion , that it does but hang in the air .</p>
   <p>477 &lt; f > As lately ‘ t was , &amp; c .] This Sedgwick had many persons ( and some of quality ) that believed in him , and prepared to keep the day of judgment with him , but were disappointed ; for which the false prophet was afterwards called by the name of Dooms - day Sedgwick .</p>
   <p>609 &lt; g > Your modern Indian &amp; c .] This compendious new way of magick is affirmed by Monsieur Le Blanc ( in his travels ) to be used in the East Indies .</p>
   <p>627 &lt; h > Bumbastus kept , &amp; c .] Paracelsus is said to have kept a small devil prisoner in the pummel of his sword , which was the reason , perhaps , why he was so valiant in his drink . Howsoever , it was to better purpose than Hannibal carried poison in his , to dispatch himself ; for the sword alone would have done the feat much better , and more soldier-like ; and it was below the honour of so great a commander , to go out of the world like a rat .</p>
   <p>635 &lt; i > Agrippa kept &amp; c .] Cornelius Agrippa had a dog which was suspected to be a spirit , for some tricks he was wont to do beyond the capacity of a dog , as it was thought ; but the author of Magia Adamica has taken a great deal of pains to vindicate both the doctor and the dog from the aspersion , in which he has shewn a very great respect and kindness for them both .</p>

Fertur dixisse Coelum omne ex Lapidibus esse compositum ; Damnatus &amp; in exilium pulsus est , quod impie Solem candentem luminam esse dixisset . [ Anaxogaras stated that the sun was made of white-hot iron , and bigger than the Peloponnese : the moon had buildings , and hills , and valleys . He was so carried away that he said that the whole sky was made of stone . He was condemned and driven into exile , for speaking impiously about the pure white light of the sun ] — Diog . Laert . in Anaxag . p. 11 , 13 .</p>
   <p>865 &lt; q > Th ’ Egyptians say &amp; c .] Egyptii decem millia Annorum &amp; amplius recensent ; &amp; observatum est in hoc tanto Spatio , bis mutata esse Loca Ortuum &amp; Occasuum Solis , ita ut Sol bis ortus sit ubi nunc occidit , &amp; bis descenderit ubi nunc oritur . [ The Egyptians have records for ten thousand years and more , and it has been observed that during this space of time , the rising and setting places of the sun have changed twice , so that twice the sun has risen where it now sets , and twice set where it now rises ] — Phil . Melanct . Lib . 1 Pag . 60 .</p>

[ Copernicus in his Book of Revolutions , and afterwards Reinholdus , very cleverly showed by mathematical means that the perihelion of the earth was ( become ) nearer in the twelve centuries since Ptolemy , that is , thirty-one times the radius of the earth . ] — Jo .

   <p>1001 &lt; y > That paltry story , &amp; c .] There was a notorious ideot ( that is here described by the name and character of Whachum ) who counterfeited a second part of Hudibras , as untowardly as Captain Po , who could not write himself , and yet made a shift to stand on the pillory for forging other men 's hands , as his fellow Whachum no doubt deserved ; in whose abominable doggerel this story of Hudibras and a French mountebank at Brentford fair is as properly described .</p>
   <p>1024 That the &lt; z > vibration &amp; c .] The device of the vibration of a Pendulum was intended to settle a certain measure of ells and yards , &amp; c. ( that should have its foundation in nature ) all the world over : For by swinging a weight at the end of a string , and calculating by the motion of the sun , or any star , how long the vibration would last , in proportion to the length of the string , and the weight of the pendulum , they thought to reduce it back again , and from any part of time to compute the exact length of any string that must necessarily vibrate into so much space of time ; so that if a man should ask in China for a quarter of an hour of satin , or taffeta , they would know perfectly what it meant ; and all mankind learn a new way to measure things , no more by the yard , foot or inch , but by the hour , quarter , and minute .</p>

     <l n="121">You must not think ‘ twill always pass ; 120</l>

     <l n="125">An artificial natural ,</l>

   <p>NOTES TO PART III . CANTO 1 .</p>
   <p>15 a And more , &amp; c .] Caligula was one of the Emperors of Rome , son of Germanicus and Agrippina . He would needs pass for a god , and had the heads of the ancient statues of the gods taken off ; and his own placed on in their stead ; and used to stand between the statues of Castor and Pollux to be worshipped ; and often bragged of lying with the Moon .</p>
   <p>43 b And us 'd &amp; c .] Philters were love potions , reported to be much in request in former ages ; but our true Knight-Errant Hero made use of no other but what his noble atchievements by his sword produced .</p>
   <p>52 c To th ’ Ordeal , &amp; c .] Ordeal trials were , when supposed criminals , to discover their innocence , went over several red-hot coulter irons . These were generally such whose chastity was suspected , as the vestal virgins , &amp; c .</p>
   <p>93 d So Spanish Heroes , &amp; c .] The young Spaniards signalize their valour before the Spanish ladies at bull feasts , which often prove very hazardous , and sometimes fatal to them . It is performed by attacking of a wild bull , kept on purpose , and let loose at the combatant ; and he that kills most , carries the laurel , and dwells highest in the ladies ’ favour .</p>
   <p>137 e To pawn , &amp; c .] His exterior ears were gone before , and so out of danger ; but by inward ears is here meant his conscience .</p>
   <p>252 f Loud as , &amp; c .] Stentrophon : A speaking trumpet , by which the voice may be heard at a great distance , very useful at sea .</p>
   <p>276 g As if th ’ had , &amp; c .] This alludes to some abject letchers , who used to be disciplined with amorous lashes by their mistresses .</p>
   <p>323 h Bewitch Hermetick Men , &amp; c .] Hermes Trismegistus , an Egyptian Philosopher , and said to have lived Anno Mundi 2076 , in the reign of Ninus , after Moses . He was a wonderful philosopher and proved that there was but one God , the creator of all things ; and was the author of several most excellent and useful inventions . But those Hermetick Men here mentioned , though the pretended sectators of this great man , are nothing else but a wild and extravagant sort of enthusiasts , who make a hodge-podge of Religion and Philosophy , and produce nothing but what is the object of every considering person 's contempt .</p>
   <p>326 i Potosi . ] Potosi is a city of Peru , the mountains whereof afford great quantities of the finest silver in all the Indies .</p>
   <p>603 k More wretched , &amp; c .] Villainage was an antient tenure , by which the tenants were obliged to perform the most abject and slavish services for their lords .</p>
   <p>639 l Like Indian Widows , &amp; c .] The Indian women , richly attired , are carried in a splendid and pompous machine to the funeral pile where the bodies of their deceased husbands are to be consumed , and there voluntarily throw themselves into it , and expire ; and such as refuse , their virtue is ever after suspected , and they live in the utmost contempt .</p>
   <p>647 m For as the Pythagorean , &amp; c .] It was the opinion of Pythogoras and his followers , that , the soul transmigrated ( as they termed it ) into all the diverse species of animals ; and so was differently disposed and affected , according to their different natures and constitutions .</p>
   <p>707 n For tho ’ Chineses , &amp; c .] The Chinese men of quality , when their wives are brought to bed , are nursed and tended with as much care as women here , and are supplied with the best strengthening and nourishing diet , in order to qualify them for future services .</p>
   <p>751 o Transform them into Rams , &amp; c .] The Sirens according to the poets , were three sea-monsters , half women and half fish : their names were Parthenope , Lignea and Leucosia . Their usual residence was about the island of Sicily , where , by the charming melody of their voices , they used to detain those that heard them , and then transform them into some sort of brute animals .</p>
   <p>755 p By the Husband Mandrake , &amp; c .] Naturalists report , that if a male and female Mandrake lie near each other , there will often be heard a sort of murmuring noise .</p>
   <p>797 q The World is but two Parts , &amp; c .] The equinoctial divides the globe into North and South .</p>
   <p>819 r Unless among the Amazons , &amp; c .] The Amazons were women of Scythia , of heroick and great atchievements . They suffered no men to live among them ; but once every year used to have conversation with men , of the neighbouring countries , by which if they had a male child , they presently either killed or crippled it ; but if a female , they brought it up to the use of arms , and burnt off one breast , leaving the other to suckle girls .</p>
   <p>865 s The Nymphs of chaste Diana 's &amp; c .] Diana 's Nymphs , all of whom vowed perpetual virginity , and were much celebrated for the exact observation of their vow .</p>
   <p>866 t Lewkner 's Lane . ] Some years ago swarmed with notoriously lascivious and profligate strumpets .</p>
   <p>877 u The Reason of it is &amp; c .] Demanding the clergy of her belly , which , for the reasons aforesaid , is pleaded in excuse by those who take the liberty to oblige themselves and friends .</p>
   <p>1086 w As IRONSIDE or HARDIKNUTE , &amp; c .] Two famous and valiant princes of this country ; the one a Saxon , the other a Dane .</p>
   <p>1131 x But those that trade in Geomancy , &amp; c .] The Lapland Magi . The Laplanders are an idolatrous people , far North : and it is very credibly reported , by authors and persons that have travelled in their country , that they do perform things incredible by what is vulgarly called Magick .</p>
   <p>1158 y To burning with , &amp; c .] An allusion to cauterizing in apoplexies , &amp; c .</p>
   <p>1321 z The Queen of Night , &amp; c .] The moon influences the tides , and predominates over all humid bodies ; and persons distempered in mind are called Lunaticks .</p>
   <p>1344 a And growing to thy Horse , &amp; c .] The Centaurs were a people of Thessaly , and supposed to be the first managers of horses ; and the neighbouring inhabitants never having seen any such thing before , fabulously reported them monsters , half men and half horses .</p>
   <p>1423 b Sir ( quoth the Voice ) &amp; c .] Sophi is at present the name of the kings of Persia , not superadded , as Pharaoh was to the kings of Egypt , but the name of the family itself , and religion of Hali ; whose descendants by Fatimas , Mahomet 's daughter , took the name of Sophi .</p>
   <p>1451 c Wear wooden Peccadillos &amp; c .] Peccadillos were stiff pieces that went about the neck ; and round about the shoulders , to pin the band , worn by persons nice in dressing ; his wooden one is a pillory .</p>
   <p>1483 d Hence ‘ tis Possessions , &amp; c .] Criminals , in their indictments , are charged with not having the fear of God before their eyes , but being led by the instigation of the Devil .</p>
   <p>1521 e When to a legal Utlegation , &amp; c .] When they return the excommunication into the Chancery , there is issued out a writ against the person .</p>
   <p>1524 f Distrain on Soul , &amp; c .] Excommunication , which deprives men from being Members of the visible church , and formally delivers them up to the Devil .</p>

   <p>NOTES TO PART III . CANTO II .</p>
   <p>1 g The Learned write , &amp; c .] An insect breeze . Breezes often bring along with them great quantities of insects , which some are of opinion , are generated from viscous exhalations in the air ; but our Author makes them proceed from a cow 's dung , and afterwards become a plague to that whence it received its original .</p>
   <p>13 h For as the Persian , &amp; c .] The Magi were priests and philosophers among the Persians , intrusted with the government both civil and ecclesiastick , much addicted to the observation of the stars . Zoroaster is reported to be their first author . They had this custom amongst them , to preserve and continue their families by incestuous copulation with their own mothers . Some are of opinion , that the three wise men that came out of the East to worship our Saviour were some of these .</p>
   <p>51 i At Michael 's Term , &amp; c .] St. Michael , an archangel ; mentioned in St. Jude 's Epistle , Verse 9 .</p>
   <p>78 k And laid about , &amp; c .] William Prynne , of Lincoln'shYpppHeNInn , Esq . born at Swanswick , who stiled himself Utter Barrister , a very warm person , and voluminous writer ; and after the Restoration , keeper of the records in the Tower .</p>
   <p>146 l As Dutch Boors , &amp; c .] It is reported of the Dutch women , that making so great use of stoves , and often putting them under their petticoats , they engender a kind of ugly monster , which is called a Sooterkin .</p>
   <p>151 m T ’ out-cant the Babylonian , &amp; c .] At the building of the Tower of Babel , when God made the confusion of languages .</p>
   <p>215 Toss 'd in a furious Hurricane , &amp; c .] At Oliver 's death was a most furious tempest , such as had not been known in the memory of man , or hardly ever recorded to have been in this nation . This Sterry reported something ridiculously fabulous concerning Oliver , not unlike what Proculus did of Romulus .</p>
   <p>224 o False Heaven , &amp; c .] After the Restoration , Oliver 's body was dug up , and his head set at the farther end of Westminster - hall , near which place there is an house of entertainment , which is commonly known by the name of Heaven .</p>
   <p>227 p So Romulus , &amp; c .] A Roman Senator , whose name was Proculus , and much beloved by Romulus , made oath before the Senate , that this prince appeared to him after his death , and predicted the future grandeur of that city , promising to be protector of it ; and expressly charged him , that he should be adored there under the name of Quirinus ; and he had his temple on Mount Quirinale .</p>
   <p>231 q Next his Son , &amp; c .] Oliver 's eldest son Richard was , by him before his death , declared his successor ; and , by order of privy-council , proclaimed Lord Protector , and received the compliments of congratulation and condolence , at the same time , from the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen : and addresses were presented to him from all parts of the nation , promising to stand by him with their lives and fortunes . He summoned a Parliament to meet at Westminster , which recognized him Lord Protector : yet , notwithstanding , Fleetwood , Desborough , and their partizans , managed affairs so , that he was obliged to resign .</p>
   <p>245 r To edify upon the Ruins , &amp; c .] John of Leyden , whose name was Buckhold , was a butcher of the same place , but a crafty , eloquent , and seditious fellow and one of those called Anabaptists . He went and set up at Munster , where , with Knipperdoling , and others of the same faction , they spread their abominable errors , and run about the streets in enthusiastical raptures , crying , Repent and be baptized , pronouncing dismal woes against all those that would not embrace their tenets . About the year 1533 they broke out into an open insurrection , and seized the palace and magazines , and grew so formidable that it was very dangerous for those who were not of their persuasion to dwell in Munster ; but at length he and his associates being subdued and taken , he was executed at Munster , had his flesh pulled off by two executioners with red - hot pincers for the space of an hour , and then run through with a sword .</p>
   <p>351 s ‘ Mong these there was a Politician , &amp; c .] This was the famous E. of S. who was endued with a particular faculty of undermining and subverting all sorts of government .</p>
   <p>409 t and better than by Napier 's Bones , &amp; c .] The famous Lord Napier , of Scotland , the first inventor of logarithms , contrived also a set of square pieces , with numbers on them , made generally of ivory , ( which perform arithmetical and geometrical calculations ,) and are commonly called Napier 's Bones .</p>
   <p>421 u To match this Saint , &amp; c .] The great colonel John Lilbourn , whose trial is so remarkable , and well known at this time .</p>
   <p>475 w The Trojan Mare , &amp; c .] After the Grecians had spent ten years in the siege of Troy , without the least prospect of success , they bethought of a stratagem , and made a wooden horse capable of containing a considerable number of armed men : this they filled with the choicest of their army , and then pretended to raise the siege ; upon which the credulous Trojans made a breach in the walls of the city to bring in this fatal plunder ; but when it was brought in , the inclosed heroes soon appeared , and surprizing the city , the rest entered in at the breach .</p>
   <p>520 x ( I mean Margaret 's Fast ) &amp; c .] That Parliament used to have publick fasts kept in St. Margaret 's church , Westminster , as is done to this present time .</p>
   <p>605 y To hang like Mahomet , &amp; c .] It is reported of Mahomet the great impostor , that having built a mosque , the roof whereof was of loadstone , and ordering his corpse , when he was dead , to be put into an iron coffin , and brought into that place , the loadstone soon attracted it near the top , where it still hangs in the air . No less fabulous is what the legend says of Ignatius Loyola , that his zeal and devotion transported him so , that at his prayers he has been seen to be raised from the ground for some considerable time together .</p>
   <p>650 z As easy as Serpents , &amp; c .] Naturalists report , that Snakes , Serpents , &amp; c. cast their skins every year .</p>
   <p>655 a As Barnacles turn Soland Geese , &amp; c .] It is said that in the Islands of the Orcades , in Scotland , there are trees which bear those barnacles , which dropping off into the water , receive life , and become those birds called soland geese .</p>
   <p>663 b So he that keeps the Gate of Hell , &amp; c .] The poets feign the dog Cerberus , that is the porter of hell , to have three heads .</p>
   <p>685 c The GIBELLINES , &amp; c .] Two great factions in Italy , distinguished by those names , miserably distracted and wasted it about the year 1130 .</p>
   <p>841 d When three Saints Ears , &amp; c .] Burton , Prynn , and Bastwick , three notorious ringleaders of the factious , just at the beginning of the late horrid rebellion .</p>
   <p>894 e But Fisher 's Folly , &amp; c .] Fisher 's Folly , was where Devonshire-Square now stands , and was a great place of consultation in those days .</p>
   <p>907 f Cut out more Work , &amp; c .] Plato 's year , or the grand revolution of the intire machine of the world , was accounted 4000 years .</p>
   <p>1200 g T ’ your great Croysado General , &amp; c .] General Fairfax , who was soon laid aside after he had done some of their drudgery for them .</p>
   <p>1241 h To pass for deep and learned Scholars , &amp; c .] Two ridiculous scribblers , that were often pestering the world with nonsense .</p>
   <p>1250 i Like Sir Pride , &amp; c .] The one a brewer , the other a shoemaker , and both colonels in the rebels ’ army .</p>
   <p>1505 k The beastly Rabble that came down , &amp; c .] This is an accurate description of the mob 's burning rumps upon the admission of the secluded Members , on contempt of the Rump - Parliament .</p>
   <p>1534 l Be ready listed under DON ] The hangman 's name at that time was Don .</p>
   <p>1550 m They 've roasted COOK already and PRIDE in . ] Cook acted as solicitor-general against King Charles the First at his trial ; and afterwards received his just reward for the same . Pride , a colonel in the Parliament 's army .</p>
   <p>1564 n Their Founder was a blown up Soldier . ] Ignatius Loyola , the founder of the society of the Jesuits , was a gentleman of Biscay , in Spain , and bred a soldier ; was at Pampelune when it was besieged by the French in the year 1521 , and was so very lame in both feet , by the damage he sustained there , that he was forced to keep his bed .</p>
   <p>1585 o And from their Coptick Priests , Kircherus . ] Athanasius Kircher , a Jesuit , hath wrote largely on the AEgyptian mystical learning .</p>
   <p>1587 p For , as the AEgyptians us 'd by Bees , &amp; c .] The AEgyptians represented their kings , ( many of whose names were Ptolemy ) under the hieroglyphick of a bee , dispensing honey to the good and virtuous , and having a sting for the wicked and dissolute .</p>

Bongey also , publishing a treatise of Natural Magick , confirmed some well-meaning credulous people in this opinion ; but it was altogether groundless ; for Bongey was chosen provincial of his order , being a person of most excellent parts and piety .</p>

     <l n="80">Before they break , to bend quite round , 80</l>
     <l n="81">So truest oaths are still most tough ,</l>

     <l n="83">Then wherefore should they not b ’ allow 'd</l>

     <l n="126">Were left to th ’ injury at laws ,</l>
     <l n="127">What tyranny can disapprove</l>
     <l n="128">There should be equity in love ;</l>

    <head>NOTES ON HUDIBRAS 's EPISTLE TO HIS LADY .</head>
    <p n="1">113 e Or who but Lovers can converse , &amp; c .] Metaphysicians are of opinion , that angels and souls departed , being divested of all gross matter , understand each other 's sentiments by intuition , and consequently maintain a sort of conversation without the organs of speech .</p>
    <p n="2">121 f Or Heav'n itself a Sin resent , &amp; c .] In regard children are capable of being inhabitants of Heaven , therefore it should not resent it as a crime to supply store of inhabitants for it .</p>
    <p n="3">173 g You wound like Parthians while you fly , &amp; c .] Parthians are the inhabitants of a province in Persia : They were excellent horsemen , and very exquisite at their bows ; and it is reported of them , that they generally slew more on their retreat than they did in the engagement .</p>
    <p n="4">188 h Than Philip Nye 's Thanksgiving Beard ] One of the Assembly of Divines , very remarkable for the singularity of his beard .</p>
    <p n="5">237 i To what a Height did Infant Rome , &amp; c .] When Romulus had built Rome , he made it an asylum , or place of refuge , for all malefactors , and others obnoxious to the laws to retire to ; by which means it soon came to be very populous ; but when he began to consider , that , without propagation , it would soon be destitute of inhabitants , he invented several fine shows , and invited the young Sabine women , then neighbours to them ; and when they had them secure , they ravished them ; from whence proceeded so numerous an offspring .</p>
    <p n="6">252 k Till Alimony or Death them parts . ] Alimony is an allowance that the law gives the woman for her separate maintenance upon living from her husband . That and death are reckoned the only separations in a married state .</p>
    <p n="7">THE LADY 'S ANSWER TO THE KNIGHT .</p>
    <p n="8">THAT you 're a beast , and turn 'd to grass , Is no strange news , nor ever was ; At least to me , who once you know , Did from the pound replevin you , When both your sword and spurs were won 5 In combat by an Amazon . That sword , that did ( like Fate ) determine Th ’ inevitable death of vermine , And never dealt its furious blows , But cut the throats of pigs and cows , 10 By TRULLA was , in single fight , Disarm 'd and wrested from its knight ; Your heels degraded of your spurs , And in the stocks close prisoners ; Where still they 'd lain , in base restraint , 15 If I , in pity of your complaint , Had not on honourable conditions , Releast ‘ em from the worst of prisons And what return that favour met You cannot ( though you wou 'd ) forget ; 20 When , being free , you strove t ’ evade The oaths you had in prison made ; Forswore yourself ; and first deny 'd it , But after own 'd and justify 'd it And when y ’ had falsely broke one vow , 25 Absolv 'd yourself by breaking two . For while you sneakingly submit , And beg for pardon at our feet , Discourag 'd by your guilty fears , To hope for quarter for your ears , 30 And doubting ‘ twas in vain to sue , You claim us boldly as your due ; Declare that treachery and force , To deal with us , is th ’ only course ; We have no title nor pretence 35 To body , soul , or conscience ; But ought to fall to that man 's share That claims us for his proper ware . These are the motives which , t ’ induce Or fright us into love , you use . 40 A pretty new way of gallanting , Between soliciting and ranting ; Like sturdy beggars , that intreat For charity at once , and threat . But since you undertake to prove 45 Your own propriety in love , As if we were but lawful prize In war between two enemies , Or forfeitures , which ev'ry lover , That wou 'd but sue for , might recover , 50 It is not hard to understand The myst'ry of this bold demand , That cannot at our persons aim , But something capable of claim .</p>
    <p n="9">‘ Tis not those paultry counterfeit 55 French stones , which in our eyes you set , But our right diamonds , that inspire And set your am'rous hearts on fire . Nor can those false St. Martin 's beads , Which on our lips you lay for reds , 60 And make us wear , like Indian dames , Add fuel to your scorching flames ; But those true rubies of the rock , Which in our cabinets we lock . ‘ Tis not those orient pearls our teeth , 65 That you are so transported with ; But those we wear about our necks , Produce those amorous effects . Nor is't those threads of gold , our hair , The periwigs you make us wear , 70 But those bright guineas in our chests , That light the wild fire in your breasts . These love-tricks I 've been vers 'd in so , That all their sly intrigues I know , And can unriddle , by their tones , 75 Their mystick cabals and jargones ; Can tell what passions , by their sounds , Pine for the beauties of my grounds ; What raptures fond and amorous O ’ th ’ charms and graces of my house ; 80 What extasy and scorching flame , Burns for my money in my name ; What from th ’ unnatural desire To beasts and cattle takes its fire ; What tender sigh , and trickling tear , 85 Longs for a thousand pounds a year ; And languishing transports are fond Of statute , mortgage , bill , and bond .</p>
    <p n="10">These are th ’ attracts which most men fall Inamour 'd , at first sight , withal 90 To these th ’ address with serenades , And court with balls and masquerades ; And yet , for all the yearning pain Y ’ have suffer 'd for their loves in vain , I fear they 'll prove so nice and coy 95 To have , and t ’ hold and to enjoy That all your oaths and labour lost , They 'll ne'er turn ladies of the post . This is not meant to disapprove Your judgment in your choice of love ; 100 Which is so wise , the greatest part Of mankind study ‘ t as an art ; For love shou 'd , like a deodand , Still fall to th ’ owner of the land ; And where there 's substance for its ground , 105 Cannot but be more firm and sound Than that which has the slightest basis Of airy virtue , wit , and graces ; Which is of such thin subtlety , It steals and creeps in at the eye , 110 And , as it can n't endure to stay , Steals out again as nice a way .</p>
    <p n="11">But love , that its extraction owns From solid gold and precious stones Must , like its shining parents , prove 115 As solid and as glorious love . Hence ‘ tis you have no way t'express Our charms and graces but by these : For what are lips , and eyes , and teeth , Which beauty invades and conquers with , 120 But rubies , pearls , and diamonds , With which a philter-love commands ?</p>
    <p n="12">This is the way all parents prove , In managing their childrens ’ love ; That force ‘ em t ’ intermarry and wed , 125 As if th ’ were bur'ing of the dead ; Cast earth to earth , as in the grave , To join in wedlock all they have : And when the settlement 's in force , Take all the rest for better or worse ; 130 For money has a power above The stars and fate to manage love ; Whose arrows , learned poets hold , That never miss , are tipp 'd with gold . And though some say , the parents ’ claims 135 To make love in their childrens ’ names , Who many times at once provide The nurse , the husband , and the bride Feel darts and charms , attracts and flames , And woo and contract in their names ; 140 And as they christen , use to marry ‘ em , And , like their gossips , answer for ‘ em ; Is not to give in matrimony , But sell and prostitute for money ; ‘ Tis better than their own betrothing , 145 Who often do't for worse than nothing ; And when th ’ are at their own dispose , With greater disadvantage choose . All this is right ; but for the course You take to do't , by fraud or force , 150 ‘ Tis so ridiculous , as soon As told , ‘ tis never to be done ; No more than setters can betray , That tell what tricks they are to play . Marriage , at best , is but a vow , 155 Which all men either break or bow : Then what will those forbear to do , Who perjure when they do but woo ? Such as before-hand swear and lie For earnest to their treachery ; 160 And , rather than a crime confess , With greater strive to make it less ; Like thieves , who , after sentence past , Maintain their innocence to the last ; And when their crimes were made appear 165 As plain as witnesses can swear , Yet , when the wretches come to die , Will take upon their death a lie , Nor are the virtues you confest T ’ your ghostly father , as you guest , 170 So slight as to be justify 'd By being as shamefully deny 'd , As if you thought your word would pass Point-blank on both sides of a case ; Or credit were not to be lost 175 B ’ a brave Knight-Errant of the Post , That eats perfidiously his word , And swears his ears through a two inch board : Can own the same thing , and disown , And perjure booty , Pro and Con : 180 Can make the Gospel serve his turn , And help him out , to be forsworn ; When ‘ tis laid hands upon , and kist , To be betray 'd and sold like Christ . These are the virtues in whose name 185 A right to all the world you claim , And boldly challenge a dominion , In grace and nature , o'er all women ; Of whom no less will satisfy Than all the sex your tyranny , 190 Although you 'll find it a hard province , With all your crafty frauds and covins , To govern such a num'rous crew , Who , one by one , now govern you : For if you all were SOLOMONS , 195 And wise and great as he was once , You 'll find they 're able to subdue ( As they did him ) and baffle you .</p>
    <p n="13">And if you are impos 'd upon ‘ Tis by your own temptation done , 200 That with your ignorance invite ; And teach us how to use the slight . For when we find y ’ are still more taken With false attracts of our own making ; Swear that 's a rose , and that a stone , 205 Like sots , to us that laid it on , And what we did but slightly prime , Most ignorantly daub in rhime ; You force us , in our own defences , To copy beams and influences ; 210 To lay perfections on the graces , And draw attracts upon our faces ; And , in compliance to your wit , Your own false jewels counterfeit . For , by the practice of those arts 215 We gain a greater share of hearts ; And those deserve in reason most That greatest pains and study cost ; For great perfections are , like heaven , Too rich a present to be given . 220 Nor are these master-strokes of beauty To be perform 'd without hard duty , Which , when they 're nobly done and well , The simple natural excell . How fair and sweet the planted rose 225 Beyond the wild in hedges grows ! For without art the noblest seeds Of flow'rs degen'rate into weeds . How dull and rugged , e 're ‘ tis ground And polish 'd , looks a diamond ! 230 Though Paradise were e'er so fair , It was not kept so without care . The whole world , without art and dress , Would be but one great wilderness ; And mankind but a savage herd , 235 For all that nature has conferr 'd . This does but rough-hew , and design ; Leaves art to polish and refine . Though women first were made for men , Yet men were made for them agen ; 240 For when ( outwitted by his wife ) Man first turn 'd tenant but for life , If women had not interven 'd , How soon had mankind had an end ! And that it is in being yet , 245 To us alone you are in debt . And where 's your liberty of choice , And our unnatural No Voice ? Since all the privilege you boast , And falsly usurp 'd , or vainly lost , 250 Is now our right ; to whose creation You owe your happy restoration : And if we had not weighty cause To not appear , in making laws , We could , in spite of all your tricks , 255 And shallow , formal politicks , Force you our managements t ’ obey , As we to yours ( in shew ) give way . Hence ‘ tis that , while you vainly strive T ’ advance your high prerogative , 260 You basely , after all your braves , Submit , and own yourselves our slaves ; And ‘ cause we do not make it known , Nor publickly our int'rest own , Like sots , suppose we have no shares 265 In ord'ring you and your affairs ; When all your empire and command You have from us at second hand As if a pilot , that appears To sit still only while he steers , 270 And does not make a noise and stir Like ev'ry common mariner , Knew nothing of the card , nor star , And did not guide the man of war ; Nor we , because we do n't appear 275 In councils , do not govern there ; While , like the mighty &lt; m > PRESTER JOHN , Whose person none dares look upon , But is preserv 'd in close disguise , From being made cheap to vulgar eyes , 280 W ’ enjoy as large a pow'r unseen , To govern him , as he does men ; And in the right of our Pope JOAN , Make Emp'rors at our feet fall down ; Or &lt; n > JOAN DE PUCEL 'S braver name , 285 Our right to arms and conduct claim ; Who , though a Spinster , yet was able To serve FRANCE for a Grand Constable .</p>
    <p n="14">We make and execute all laws ; Can judge the judges and the cause ; 290 Prescribe all rules of right or wrong To th ’ long robe , and the longer tongue ; ‘ Gainst which the world has no defence ; But our more pow'rful eloquence . We manage things of greatest weight 295 In all the world 's affairs of state Are ministers of war and peace , That sway all nations how we please . We rule all churches and their flocks , Heretical and orthodox ; 300 And are the heavenly vehicles O ’ th ’ spirits in all conventicles . By us is all commerce and trade Improv 'd , and manag 'd , and decay 'd ; For nothing can go off so well , 305 Nor bears that price , as what we sell . We rule in ev'ry publique meeting , And make men do what we judge fitting ; Are magistrates in all great towns , Where men do nothing but wear gowns . 310 We make the man of war strike sail , And to our braver conduct veil , And , when h ’ has chac 'd his enemies , Submit to us upon his knees . Is there an officer of state 315 Untimely rais 'd , or magistrate , That 's haughty and imperious ? He 's but a journeyman to us . That as he gives us cause to do't , Can keep him in , or turn him out . 320</p>
    <p n="15">We are your guardians , that increase Or waste your fortunes how we please ; And , as you humour us , can deal In all your matters , ill or well .</p>
    <p n="16">‘ Tis we that can dispose alone , 325 Whether your heirs shall be your own , To whose integrity you must , In spight of all your caution , trust ; And , ‘ less you fly beyond the seas , Can fit you with what heirs we please ; 330 And force you t ’ own ‘ em , though begotten By French Valets or Irish Footmen . Nor can the vigorousest course Prevail , unless to make us worse ; Who still , the harsher we are us 'd , 335 Are further off from b'ing reduc 'd ; And scorn t ’ abate , for any ills , The least punctilios of our wills . Force does but whet our wits t ’ apply Arts , born with us , for remedy ; 340 Which all your politicks , as yet , Have ne'er been able to defeat : For when y ’ have try 'd all sorts of ways , What fools d ’ we make of you in plays ! While all the favours we afford , 345 Are but to girt you with the sword , To fight our battles in our steads , And have your brains beat out o ’ your heads ; Encounter , in despite of nature , And fight at once , with fire and water , 350 With pirates , rocks , and storms , and seas , Our pride and vanity t ’ appease ; Kill one another , and cut throats , For our good graces , and best thoughts ; To do your exercise for honour , 355 And have your brains beat out the sooner ; Or crack 'd , as learnedly , upon Things that are never to be known ; And still appear the more industrious , The more your projects are prepost'rous ; 360 To square the circle of the arts , And run stark mad to shew your parts ; Expound the oracle of laws , And turn them which way we see cause Be our solicitors and agents , 365 And stand for us in all engagements .</p>
    <p n="17">And these are all the mighty pow'rs You vainly boast to cry down ours ; And what in real value 's wanting , Supply with vapouring and ranting ; 370 Because yourselves are terrify 'd , And stoop to one another 's pride , Believe we have as little wit To be out-hector 'd , and submit ; By your example , lose that right 375 In treaties which we gain 'd in fight ; And , terrify 'd into an awe , Pass on ourselves a &lt; o > Salique law :</p>
    <p n="18">Or , as some nations use , give place , And truckle to your mighty race ; 380 Let men usurp th ’ unjust dominion , As if they were the better women .</p>

    <p n="20">133 l Whose Arrows learned Poets hold , &amp; c .] The poets feign Cupid to have two sorts of arrows ; the one tipped with gold , and the other with lead . The golden always inspire and inflame love in the persons he wounds with them : but , on the contrary , the leaden create the utmost aversion and hatred . With the first of these he shot Apollo , and with the other Daphne , according to Ovid .</p>

    <p n="22">285 Or Joan de Pucel 's braver Name . ] Joan of Arc , called also the Pucelle , or Maid of Orleans . She was born at the town of Damremi , on the Meuse , daughter of James de Arc , and Isabella Romee ; and was bred , up a shepherdess in the country . At the age of eighteen or twenty she pretended to an express commission from God to go to the relief of Orleans , then besieged by the English , and defended by John Compte de Dennis , and almost reduced to the last extremity . She went to the coronation of Charles the Seventh , when he was almost ruined . She knew that prince in the midst of his nobles ; though meanly habited . The doctors of divinity , and members of parliament , openly declared that there was some thing supernatural in her conduct . She sent for a sword , which lay in the tomb of a knight , which was behind the great altar of the church of St. Katharine de Forbois , upon the blade of which the cross and flower-de-luces were engraven , which put the king in a very great surprise , in regard none besides himself knew of it . Upon this he sent her with the command of some troops , with which she relieved Orleans , and drove the English from it , defeated Talbot at the battle of Pattai , and recovered Champagne . At last she was unfortunately taken prisoner in a sally at Champagne in 1430 , and tried for a witch or sorceress , condemned , and burnt in Rouen market-place in May 1430 .</p>
