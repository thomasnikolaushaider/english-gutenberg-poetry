    <head>THE TWO FRIENDS</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">AXIOCHUS , a handsome youth of old ,</l>
     <l n="2">And Alcibiades , ( both gay and bold ,)</l>
     <l n="3">So well agreed , they kept a beauteous belle ,</l>
     <l n="4">With whom by turns they equally would dwell .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">IT happened , one of them so nicely played ,</l>
     <l n="6">The fav'rite lass produced a little maid ,</l>
     <l n="7">Which both extolled , and each his own believed ,</l>
     <l n="8">Though doubtless one or t'other was deceived .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">BUT when to riper years the bantling grew ,</l>
     <l n="10">And sought her mother 's foot-steps to pursue ,</l>
     <l n="11">Each friend desired to be her chosen swain ,</l>
     <l n="12">And neither would a parent 's name retain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">SAID one , why brother , she 's your very shade ;</l>
     <l n="14">The features are the same - : - your looks pervade .</l>
     <l n="15">Oh no , the other cried , it cannot be</l>
     <l n="16">Her chin , mouth , nose , and eyes , with your 's agree ;</l>
     <l n="17">But that as ‘ twill , let me her favours win ,</l>
     <l n="18">And for the pleasure I will risk the sin .</l>

    <head>THE COUNTRY JUSTICE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">TWO lawyers to their cause so well adhered ,</l>
     <l n="2">A country justice quite confused appeared ,</l>
     <l n="3">By them the facts were rendered so obscure</l>
     <l n="4">With which the truth remained he was not sure .</l>
     <l n="5">At length , completely tired , two straws he sought</l>
     <l n="6">Of diff'rent lengths , and to the parties brought .</l>
     <l n="7">These in his hand he held :— the plaintiff drew</l>
     <l n="8">( So fate decreed ) the shortest of the two .</l>
     <l n="9">On this the other homeward took his way ,</l>
     <l n="10">To boast how nicely he had gained the day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">THE bench complained : the magistrate replied</l>
     <l n="12">Do n't blame I pray — ‘ tis nothing new I 've tried ;</l>
     <l n="13">Courts often judge at hazard in the law ,</l>
     <l n="14">Without deciding by the longest straw .</l>

    <head>ALICE SICK</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">SICK , Alice grown , and fearing dire event ,</l>
     <l n="2">Some friend advised a servant should be sent</l>
     <l n="3">Her confessor to bring and ease her mind ;—</l>
     <l n="4">Yes , she replied , to see him I 'm inclined ;</l>
     <l n="5">Let father Andrew instantly be sought :—</l>
     <l n="6">By him salvation usually I 'm taught .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">A MESSENGER was told , without delay ,</l>
     <l n="8">To take , with rapid steps , the convent way ;</l>
     <l n="9">He rang the bell — a monk enquired his name ,</l>
     <l n="10">And asked for what , or whom , the fellow came .</l>
     <l n="11">I father Andrew want , the wight replied ,</l>
     <l n="12">Who 's oft to Alice confessor and guide :</l>
     <l n="13">With Andrew , cried the other , would you speak ?</l>
     <l n="14">If that 's the case , he 's far enough to seek ;</l>
     <l n="15">Poor man ! he 's left us for the regions blessed ,</l>
     <l n="16">And has in Paradise ten years confessed .</l>

    <head>THE KISS RETURNED</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">AS WILLIAM walking with his wife was seen ,</l>
     <l n="2">A man of rank admired her lovely mien .</l>
     <l n="3">Who gave you such a charming fair ? he cried ,</l>
     <l n="4">May I presume to kiss your beauteous bride ?</l>
     <l n="5">With all my heart , replied the humble swain ,</l>
     <l n="6">You 're welcome , sir :— I beg you 'll not refrain ;</l>
     <l n="7">She 's at your service : take the boon , I pray ;</l>
     <l n="8">You 'll not such offers meet with ev'ry day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">THE gentleman proceeded as desired ;</l>
     <l n="10">To get a kiss , alone he had aspired ;</l>
     <l n="11">So fervently howe'er he pressed her lip ,</l>
     <l n="12">That Petronella blushed at ev'ry sip .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">SEVEN days had scarcely run , when to his arms ,</l>
     <l n="14">The other took a wife with seraph charms ;</l>
     <l n="15">And William was allowed to have a kiss ,</l>
     <l n="16">That filled his soul with soft ecstatick bliss .</l>
     <l n="17">Cried he , I wish , ( and truly I am grieved )</l>
     <l n="18">That when the gentleman a kiss received ,</l>
     <l n="19">From her I love , he 'd gone to greater height ,</l>
     <l n="20">And with my Petronella passed the night .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">WHEN Sister Jane , who had produced a child ,</l>
     <l n="2">In prayer and penance all her hours beguiled</l>
     <l n="3">Her sister-nuns around the lattice pressed ;</l>
     <l n="4">On which the abbess thus her flock addressed :</l>
     <l n="5">Live like our sister Jane , and bid adieu</l>
     <l n="6">To worldly cares :— have better things in view .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">YES , they replied , we sage like her shall be ,</l>

    <head>AN IMITATION OF ANACREON</head>
     <l n="1">PAINTER in Paphos and Cythera famed</l>
     <l n="2">Depict , I pray , the absent Iris ’ face .</l>
     <l n="3">Thou hast not seen the lovely nymph I 've named ;</l>
     <l n="4">The better for thy peace .— Then will I trace</l>
     <l n="5">For thy instruction her transcendent grace .</l>
     <l n="6">Begin with lily white and blushing rose ,</l>
     <l n="7">Take then the Loves and Graces ... But what good</l>
     <l n="8">Words , idle words ? for Beauty 's Goddess could</l>
     <l n="9">By Iris be replaced , nor one suppose</l>
     <l n="10">The secret fraud — their grace so equal shows .</l>
     <l n="11">Thou at Cythera couldst , at Paphos too ,</l>
     <l n="12">Of the same Iris Venus form anew .</l>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>ANOTHER IMITATION OF ANACREON</head>
     <l n="1">PRONE , on my couch I calmly slept</l>
     <l n="2">Against my wont . A little child</l>
     <l n="3">Awoke me as he gently crept</l>
     <l n="4">And beat my door . A tempest wild</l>
     <l n="5">Was raging-dark and cold the night .</l>
     <l n="6">“ Have pity on my naked plight , ”</l>
     <l n="7">He begged , “ and ope thy door ” .— “ Thy name ? ”</l>
     <l n="8">I asked admitting him .— “ The same</l>
     <l n="9">“ Anon I 'll tell , but first must dry</l>
     <l n="10">“ My weary limbs , then let me try</l>
     <l n="11">“ My mois'ened bow . ” — Despite my fear</l>
     <l n="12">The hearth I lit , then drew me near</l>
     <l n="13">My guest , and chafed his fingers cold .</l>
     <l n="14">“ Why fear ? ” I thought . “ Let me be bold</l>
     <l n="15">“ No Polyphemus he ; what harm</l>
     <l n="16">“ In such a child ?— Then I 'll be calm ! ”</l>
     <l n="17">The playful boy drew out a dart ,</l>
     <l n="18">Shook his fair locks , and to my heart</l>
     <l n="19">His shaft he launch 'd .— “ Love is my name , ”</l>
     <l n="20">He thankless cried , “ I hither came</l>
     <l n="21">“ To tame thee . In thine ardent pain</l>
     <l n="22">“ Of Cupid think and young Climene . ” —</l>
     <l n="23">“ Ah ! now I know thee , little scamp ,</l>
     <l n="24">“ Ungrateful , cruel boy ! Decamp ! ”</l>
     <l n="25">Cupid a saucy caper cut ,</l>
     <l n="26">Skipped through the door , and as it shut ,</l>
     <l n="27">“ My bow , ” he taunting cried , “ is sound ,</l>
     <l n="28">“ Thy heart , poor comrade , feels the wound . ”</l>
