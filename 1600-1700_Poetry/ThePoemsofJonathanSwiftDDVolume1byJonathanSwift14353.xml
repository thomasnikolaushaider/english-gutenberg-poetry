    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">The works of Jonathan Swift in prose and verse so mutually illustrate each other , that it was deemed indispensable , as a complement to the standard edition of the Prose Works , to issue a revised edition of the Poems , freed from the errors which had been allowed to creep into the text , and illustrated with fuller explanatory notes . My first care , therefore , in preparing the Poems for publication , was to collate them with the earliest and best editions available , and this I have done .</p>
    <p n="2">But , thanks to the diligence of the late John Forster , to whom every lover of Swift must confess the very greatest obligation , I have been able to do much more . I have been able to enrich this edition with some pieces not hitherto brought to light — notably , the original version of “ Baucis and Philemon , ” in addition to the version hitherto printed ; the original version of the poem on “ Vanbrugh 's House ” ; the verses entitled “ May Fair ” ; and numerous variations and corrections of the texts of nearly all the principal poems , due to Forster 's collation of them with the transcripts made by Stella , which were found by him at Narford formerly the seat of Swift 's friend , Sir Andrew Fountaine — see Forster 's “ Life of Swift , ” of which , unfortunately , he lived to publish only the first volume . From Swift 's own copy of the “ Miscellanies in Prose and Verse , ” 1727-32 , with notes in his own handwriting , sold at auction last year , I was able to make several corrections of the poems contained in those four volumes , which serve to show how Swift laboured his works , and revised and improved them whenever he had an opportunity of doing so . It is a mistake to suppose that he was indifferent to literary fame : on the contrary , he kept some of his works in manuscript for years in order to perfect them for publication , of which “ The Tale of a Tub , ” “ Gulliver 's Travels , ” and the “ Verses on his own Death ” are examples .</p>
    <p n="3">I am indebted to Miss Wilmot-Chetwode , of Wordbrooke , for the loan of a manuscript volume , from which I obtained some various readings . By the advice of Mr. Elrington Ball , I applied to the librarians of Trinity College and of the National Library , and from the latter I received a number of pieces ; but I found that the harvest had already been reaped so fully , that there was nothing left to glean which could with certainty be ascribed to Swift . On the whole , I believe that this edition of the Poems will be found as complete as it is now possible to make it .</p>
    <p n="4">In the arrangement of the poems , I have adopted nearly the same order as in the Aldine edition , for the pieces seem to fall naturally into those divisions ; but with this difference , that I have placed the pieces in their chronological order in each division . With regard to the notes in illustration of the text , many of them in the Dublin editions were evidently written by Swift , especially the notes to the “ Verses on his own Death . ” And as to the notes of previous editors , I have retained them so far as they were useful and correct : but to many of them I have made additions or alterations wherever , on reference to the authorities cited , or to other works , correction became necessary . For my own notes , I can only say that I have sought to make them concise , appropriate to the text , and , above all , accurate .</p>
    <p n="5">Swift and the educated men of his time thought in the classics , and his poems , as well as those of his friends , abound with allusions to the Greek and Roman authors , especially to the latter . I have given all the references , and except in the imitations and paraphrases of so familiar a writer as Horace , I have appended the Latin text . Moreover , Swift was , like Sterne , very fond of curious and recondite reading , in which it is not always easy to track him without some research ; but I believe that I have not failed to illustrate any matter that required elucidation .</p>

    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="8">Dr. Johnson , in his “ Life of Swift , ” after citing with approval Delany 's character of him , as he describes him to Lord Orrery , proceeds to say : “ In the poetical works there is not much upon which the critic can exercise his powers . They are often humorous , almost always light , and have the qualities which recommend such compositions , easiness and gaiety . They are , for the most part , what their author intended . The diction is correct , the numbers are smooth , and the rhymes exact . There seldom occurs a hard laboured expression or a redundant epithet ; all his verses exemplify his own definition of a good style — they consist of ‘ proper words in proper places . ’ ”</p>
    <p n="9">Of his earliest poems it is needless to say more than that if nothing better had been written by him than those Pindaric Pieces , after the manner of Cowley — then so much in vogue — the remark of Dryden , “ Cousin Swift , you will never be a Poet , ” would have been fully justified . But conventional praise and compliments were foreign to his nature , for his strongest characteristic was his intense sincerity . He says of himself that about that time he had writ and burnt and writ again upon all manner of subjects more than perhaps any man in England ; and it is certainly remarkable that in so doing his true genius was not sooner developed , for it was not till he became chaplain in Lord Berkeley 's household that his satirical humour was first displayed — at least in verse — in “ Mrs. Frances Harris ’ Petition . ” — His great prose satires , “ The Tale of a Tub , ” and “ Gulliver 's Travels , ” though planned , were reserved to a later time .— In other forms of poetry he soon afterwards greatly excelled , and the title of poet cannot be refused to the author of “ Baucis and Philemon ” ; the verses on “ The Death of Dr . Swift ” ; the “ Rhapsody on Poetry ” ; “ Cadenus and Vanessa ” ; “ The Legion Club ” ; and most of the poems addressed to Stella , all of which pieces exhibit harmony , invention , and imagination .</p>
    <p n="10">Swift has been unduly censured for the coarseness of his language upon Certain topics ; but very little of this appears in his earlier poems , and what there is , was in accordance with the taste of the period , which never hesitated to call a spade a spade , due in part to the reaction from the Puritanism of the preceding age , and in part to the outspeaking frankness which disdained hypocrisy . It is shown in Dryden , Pope , Prior , of the last of whom Johnson said that no lady objected to have his poems in her library ; still more in the dramatists of that time , whom Charles Lamb has so humorously defended , and in the plays of Mrs. Aphra Behn , who , as Pope says , “ fairly puts all characters to bed . ” But whatever coarseness there may be in some of Swift 's poems , such as “ The Lady 's Dressing Room , ” and a few other pieces , there is nothing licentious , nothing which excites to lewdness ; on the contrary , such pieces create simply a feeling of repulsion . No one , after reading the “ Beautiful young Nymph going to bed , ” or “ Strephon and Chloe , ” would desire any personal acquaintance with the ladies , but there is a moral in these pieces , and the latter poem concludes with excellent matrimonial advice . The coarseness of some of his later writings must be ascribed to his misanthropical hatred of the “ animal called man , ” as expressed in his famous letter to Pope of September 1725 , aggravated as it was by his exile from the friends he loved to a land he hated , and by the reception he met with there , about which he speaks very freely in his notes to the “ Verses on his own Death . ”</p>
    <p n="11">On the morning of Swift 's installation as Dean , the following scurrilous lines by Smedley , Dean of Clogher , were affixed to the doors of St. Patrick 's Cathedral :</p>
    <p n="12">To-day this Temple gets a Dean Of parts and fame uncommon , Us 'd both to pray and to prophane , To serve both God and mammon . When Wharton reign 'd a Whig he was ; When Pembroke — that 's dispute , Sir ; In Oxford 's time , what Oxford pleased , Non-con , or Jack , or Neuter . This place he got by wit and rhime , And many ways most odd , And might a Bishop be in time , Did he believe in God . Look down , St. Patrick , look , we pray , On thine own church and steeple ; Convert thy Dean on this great day , Or else God help the people . And now , whene'er his Deanship dies , Upon his stone be graven , A man of God here buried lies , Who never thought of heaven .</p>
    <p n="13">It was by these lines that Smedley earned for himself a niche in “ The Dunciad . ” For Swift 's retaliation , see the poems relating to Smedley at the end of the first volume , and in volume ii , at p. 124 , note .</p>
    <p n="14">This bitterness of spirit reached its height in “ Gulliver 's Travels , ” surely the severest of all satires upon humanity , and writ , as he tells us , not to divert , but to vex the world ; and ultimately , in the fierce attack upon the Irish Parliament in the poem entitled “ The Legion Club , ” dictated by his hatred of tyranny and oppression , and his consequent passion for exhibiting human nature in its most degraded aspect .</p>
    <p n="15">But , notwithstanding his misanthropical feelings towards mankind in general , and his “ scorn of fools by fools mistook for pride , ” there never existed a warmer or sincerer friend to those whom he loved — witness the regard in which he was held by Oxford , Bolingbroke , Pope , Gay , Arbuthnot , and Congreve , and his readiness to assist those who needed his help , without thought of party or politics . Although , in some of his poems , Swift rather severely exposed the follies and frailties of the fair sex , as in “ The Furniture of a Woman 's Mind , ” and “ The Journal of a Modern Lady , ” he loved the companionship of beautiful and accomplished women , amongst whom he could count some of his dearest and truest friends ; but He loved to be bitter at A lady illiterate ; and therefore delighted in giving them literary instruction , most notably in the cases of Stella and Vanessa , whose relations with him arose entirely from the tuition in letters which they received from him . Again , when on a visit at Sir Arthur Acheson 's , he insisted upon making Lady Acheson read such books as he thought fit to advise , and in the doggerel verses entitled “ My Lady 's Lamentation , ” she is supposed to resent his “ very imperious ” manner of instruction :</p>
    <p n="16">No book for delight Must come in my sight ; But instead of new plays , Dull Bacon 's Essays , And pore every day on That nasty Pantheon .</p>
    <p n="17">As a contrast to his imperiousness , there is an affectionate simplicity in the fancy names he used to bestow upon his female friends . Sir William Temple 's wife , Dorothea , became Dorinda ; Esther Johnson , Stella ; Hester Vanhomrigh , Vanessa ; Lady Winchelsea , Ardelia ; while to Lady Acheson he gave the nicknames of Skinnybonia , Snipe , and Lean . But all was taken by them in good part ; for his rather dictatorial ways were softened by the fascinating geniality and humour which he knew so well how to employ when he used to “ deafen them with puns and rhyme . ”</p>
    <p n="18">Into the vexed question of the relations between Swift and Stella I do not purpose to enter further than to record my conviction that she was never more to him than “ the dearest friend that ever man had . ” The suggestion of a concealed marriage is so inconsistent with their whole conduct to each other from first to last , that if there had been such a marriage , instead of Swift having been , as he was , a man of intense sincerity , he must be held to have been a most consummate hypocrite . In my opinion , Churton Collins settled this question in his essays on Swift , first published in the “ Quarterly Review , ” 1881 and 1882 . Swift 's relation with Vanessa is the saddest episode in his life . The story is amply told in his poem , “ Cadenus and Vanessa , ” and in the letters which passed between them : how the pupil became infatuated with her tutor ; how the tutor endeavoured to dispel her passion , but in vain , by reason ; and how , at last , she died from love for the man who was unable to give love in return . That Swift ought , as soon as Hester disclosed her passion for him , at once to have broken off the intimacy , must be conceded ; but how many men possessed of his kindness of heart would have had the courage to have acted otherwise than he did ? Swift seems , in fact , to have been constitutionally incapable of the passion of love , for he says , himself , that he had never met the woman he wished to marry . His annual tributes to Stella on her birthdays express the strongest regard and esteem , but he “ ne'er admitted love a guest , ” and he had been so long used to this Platonic affection , that he had come to regard women as friends , but never as lovers . Stella , on her part , had the same feeling , for she never expressed the least discontent at her position , or ever regarded Swift otherwise than as her tutor , her counsellor , her friend . In her verses to him on his birthday , 1721 , she says :</p>
    <p n="19">Long be the day that gave you birth Sacred to friendship , wit , and mirth ; Late dying may you cast a shred Of your rich mantle o'er my head ; To bear with dignity my sorrow One day alone , then die tomorrow .</p>
    <p n="20">Stella naturally expected to survive Swift , but it was not to be . She died in the evening of the 28th January 1727-8 ; and on the same night he began the affecting piece , “ On the Death of Mrs. Johnson . ” ( See “ Prose Works , ” vol . xi . )</p>
    <p n="21">With the death of Stella , Swift 's real happiness ended , and he became more and more possessed by the melancholy which too often accompanies the broadest humour , and which , in his case , was constitutional . It was , no doubt , to relieve it , that he resorted to the composition of the doggerel verses , epigrams , riddles , and trifles exchanged betwixt himself and Sheridan , which induced Orrery 's remark that “ Swift composing Riddles is Titian painting draught-boards ; ” on which Delany observes that “ a Riddle may be as fine painting as any other in the world . It requires as strong an imagination , as fine colouring , and as exact a proportion and keeping as any other historical painting ” ; and he instances “ Pethox the Great , ” and should also have alluded to the more learned example — “ Louisa to Strephon . ”</p>
    <p n="22">On Orrery 's seventh Letter , Delany says that if some of the “ coin is base , ” it is the fine impression and polish which adds value to it , and cites the saying of another nobleman , that “ there is indeed some stuff in it , but it is Swift 's stuff . ” It has been said that Swift has never taken a thought from any writer ancient or modern . This is not literally true , but the instances are not many , and in my notes I have pointed out the lines snatched from Milton , Denham , Butler — the last evidently a great favourite .</p>
    <p n="23">It seems necessary to state shortly the causes of Swift not having obtained higher preferment . Besides that Queen Anne would never be reconciled to the author of the “ Tale of a Tub ” — the true purport of which was so ill-understood by her — he made an irreconcilable enemy of her friend , the Duchess of Somerset , by his lampoon entitled “ The Windsor Prophecy . ” But Swift seldom allowed prudence to restrain his wit and humour , and admits of himself that he “ had too much satire in his vein ” ; and that “ a genius in the reverend gown must ever keep its owner down ” ; and says further :</p>
    <p n="24">Humour and mirth had place in all he writ ; He reconciled divinity and wit .</p>
    <p n="25">But that was what his enemies could not do .</p>
    <p n="26">Whatever the excellences and defects of the poems , Swift has erected , not only by his works , but by his benevolence and his charities , a monumentum aere perennius , and his writings in prose and verse will continue to afford instruction and delight when the malevolence of Jeffrey , the misrepresentations of Macaulay , and the sneers and false statements of Thackeray shall have been forgotten .</p>

    <docTitle><titlePart>But where is even thy Image on our earth ? For of the person much I fear , Since Heaven will claim its residence , as well as birth , And God himself has said , He shall not find it here . For this inferior world is but Heaven 's dusky shade , By dark reverted rays from its reflection made ; Whence the weak shapes wild and imperfect pass , Like sunbeams shot at too far distance from a glass ; Which all the mimic forms express , Though in strange uncouth postures , and uncomely dress ; So when Cartesian artists try To solve appearances of sight In its reception to the eye , And catch the living landscape through a scanty light , The figures all inverted show , And colours of a faded hue ; Here a pale shape with upward footstep treads , And men seem walking on their heads ; There whole herds suspended lie , Ready to tumble down into the sky ; Such are the ways ill-guided mortals go To judge of things above by things below . Disjointing shapes as in the fairy land of dreams , Or images that sink in streams ; No wonder , then , we talk amiss Of truth , and what , or where it is ; Say , Muse , for thou , if any , know'st , Since the bright essence fled , where haunts the reverend ghost ? III If all that our weak knowledge titles virtue , be ( High Truth ) the best resemblance of exalted Thee , If a mind fix 'd to combat fate With those two powerful swords , submission and humility , Sounds truly good , or truly great ; Ill may I live , if the good Sancroft , in his holy rest , In the divinity of retreat , Be not the brightest pattern earth can show Of heaven-born Truth below ; But foolish man still judges what is best In his own balance , false and light , Following opinion , dark and blind , That vagrant leader of the mind , Till honesty and conscience are clear out of sight . IV And some , to be large ciphers in a state , Pleased with an empty swelling to be counted great , Make their minds travel o'er infinity of space , Rapt through the wide expanse of thought , And oft in contradiction 's vortex caught , To keep that worthless clod , the body , in one place ; Errors like this did old astronomers misguide , Led blindly on by gross philosophy and pride , Who , like hard masters , taught the sun Through many a heedless sphere to run , Many an eccentric and unthrifty motion make , And thousand incoherent journeys take , Whilst all th'advantage by it got , Was but to light earth 's inconsiderable spot . The herd beneath , who see the weathercock of state Hung loosely on the church 's pinnacle , Believe it firm , because perhaps the day is mild and still ; But when they find it turn with the first blast of fate , By gazing upward giddy grow , And think the church itself does so ; Thus fools , for being strong and num'rous known , Suppose the truth , like all the world , their own ; And holy Sancroft 's motion quite irregular appears , Because ‘ tis opposite to theirs . V In vain then would the Muse the multitude advise , Whose peevish knowledge thus perversely lies In gath'ring follies from the wise ; Rather put on thy anger and thy spite , And some kind power for once dispense Through the dark mass , the dawn of so much sense , To make them understand , and feel me when I write ; The muse and I no more revenge desire , Each line shall stab , shall blast , like daggers and like fire ; Ah , Britain , land of angels ! which of all thy sins , ( Say , hapless isle , although It is a bloody list we know ,) Has given thee up a dwelling-place to fiends ? Sin and the plague ever abound In governments too easy , and too fruitful ground ; Evils which a too gentle king , Too flourishing a spring , And too warm summers bring : Our British soil is over rank , and breeds Among the noblest flowers a thousand pois'nous weeds , And every stinking weed so lofty grows , As if ‘ twould overshade the Royal Rose ; The Royal Rose , the glory of our morn , But , ah ! too much without a thorn . VI Forgive ( original mildness ) this ill-govern 'd zeal , ‘ Tis all the angry slighted Muse can do In the pollution of these days ; No province now is left her but to rail , And poetry has lost the art to praise , Alas , the occasions are so few : None e'er but you , And your Almighty Master , knew With heavenly peace of mind to bear ( Free from our tyrant passions , anger , scorn , or fear ) The giddy turns of popular rage , And all the contradictions of a poison 'd age ; The Son of God pronounced by the same breath Which straight pronounced his death ; And though I should but ill be understood , In wholly equalling our sin and theirs , And measuring by the scanty thread of wit What we call holy , and great , and just , and good , ( Methods in talk whereof our pride and ignorance make use ,) And which our wild ambition foolishly compares With endless and with infinite ; Yet pardon , native Albion , when I say , Among thy stubborn sons there haunts that spirit of the Jews , That those forsaken wretches who to-day Revile his great ambassador , Seem to discover what they would have done ( Were his humanity on earth once more ) To his undoubted Master , Heaven 's Almighty Son . VII But zeal is weak and ignorant , though wondrous proud , Though very turbulent and very loud ; The crazy composition shows , Like that fantastic medley in the idol 's toes , Made up of iron mixt with clay , This crumbles into dust , That moulders into rust , Or melts by the first shower away . Nothing is fix 'd that mortals see or know , Unless , perhaps , some stars above be so ; And those , alas , do show , Like all transcendent excellence below ; In both , false mediums cheat our sight , And far exalted objects lessen by their height : Thus primitive Sancroft moves too high To be observed by vulgar eye , And rolls the silent year On his own secret regular sphere , And sheds , though all unseen , his sacred influence here . VIII Kind star , still may'st thou shed thy sacred influence here , Or from thy private peaceful orb appear ; For , sure , we want some guide from Heaven , to show The way which every wand'ring fool below Pretends so perfectly to know ; And which , for aught I see , and much I fear , The world has wholly miss 'd ; I mean the way which leads to Christ : Mistaken idiots ! see how giddily they run , Led blindly on by avarice and pride , What mighty numbers follow them ; Each fond of erring with his guide : Some whom ambition drives , seek Heaven 's high Son In Caesar 's court , or in Jerusalem : Others , ignorantly wise , Among proud doctors and disputing Pharisees : What could the sages gain but unbelieving scorn ; Their faith was so uncourtly , when they said That Heaven 's high Son was in a village born ; That the world 's Saviour had been In a vile manger laid , And foster 'd in a wretched inn ? IX Necessity , thou tyrant conscience of the great , Say , why the church is still led blindfold by the state ; Why should the first be ruin 'd and laid waste , To mend dilapidations in the last ? And yet the world , whose eyes are on our mighty Prince , Thinks Heaven has cancell 'd all our sins , And that his subjects share his happy influence ; Follow the model close , for so I 'm sure they should , But wicked kings draw more examples than the good : And divine Sancroft , weary with the weight Of a declining church , by faction , her worst foe , oppress 'd , Finding the mitre almost grown A load as heavy as the crown , Wisely retreated to his heavenly rest . X Ah ! may no unkind earthquake of the state , Nor hurricano from the crown , Disturb the present mitre , as that fearful storm of late , Which , in its dusky march along the plain , Swept up whole churches as it list , Wrapp 'd in a whirlwind and a mist ; Like that prophetic tempest in the virgin reign , And swallow 'd them at last , or flung them down . Such were the storms good Sancroft long has borne ; The mitre , which his sacred head has worn , Was , like his Master 's Crown , inwreath 'd with thorn . Death 's sting is swallow 'd up in victory at last , The bitter cup is from him past : Fortune in both extremes Though blasts from contrariety of winds , Yet to firm heavenly minds , Is but one thing under two different names ; And even the sharpest eye that has the prospect seen , Confesses ignorance to judge between ; And must to human reasoning opposite conclude , To point out which is moderation , which is fortitude . XI Thus Sancroft , in the exaltation of retreat , Shows lustre that was shaded in his seat ; Short glimm'rings of the prelate glorified ; Which the disguise of greatness only served to hide . Why should the Sun , alas ! be proud To lodge behind a golden cloud ? Though fringed with evening gold the cloud appears so gay , ‘ Tis but a low-born vapour kindled by a ray : At length ‘ tis overblown and past , Puff 'd by the people 's spiteful blast , The dazzling glory dims their prostituted sight , No deflower 'd eye can face the naked light : Yet does this high perfection well proceed From strength of its own native seed , This wilderness , the world , like that poetic wood of old , Bears one , and but one branch of gold , Where the bless 'd spirit lodges like the dove , And which ( to heavenly soil transplanted ) will improve , To be , as ‘ twas below , the brightest plant above ; For , whate'er theologic levellers dream , There are degrees above , I know , As well as here below , ( The goddess Muse herself has told me so ) , Where high patrician souls , dress 'd heavenly gay , Sit clad in lawn of purer woven day . There some high-spirited throne to Sancroft shall be given , In the metropolis of Heaven ; Chief of the mitred saints , and from archprelate here , Translated to archangel there . XII Since , happy saint , since it has been of late Either our blindness or our fate , To lose the providence of thy cares Pity a miserable church 's tears , That begs the powerful blessing of thy prayers . Some angel , say , what were the nation 's crimes , That sent these wild reformers to our times : Say what their senseless malice meant , To tear religion 's lovely face : Strip her of every ornament and grace ; In striving to wash off th'imaginary paint ? Religion now does on her death-bed lie , Heart-sick of a high fever and consuming atrophy ; How the physicians swarm to show their mortal skill , And by their college arts methodically kill : Reformers and physicians differ but in name , One end in both , and the design the same ; Cordials are in their talk , while all they mean Is but the patient 's death , and gain — Check in thy satire , angry Muse , Or a more worthy subject choose : Let not the outcasts of an outcast age Provoke the honour of my Muse 's rage , Nor be thy mighty spirit rais 'd , Since Heaven and Cato both are pleas 'd — [ The rest of the poem is lost . ]</titlePart></docTitle>

SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE WRITTEN AT MOOR-PARK IN JUNE<date>1689</date>I Virtue , the greatest of all monarchies ! Till its first emperor , rebellious man , Deposed from off his seat , It fell , and broke with its own weight Into small states and principalities , By many a petty lord possess 'd , But ne'er since seated in one single breast . ‘ Tis you who must this land subdue , The mighty conquest 's left for you , The conquest and discovery too : Search out this Utopian ground , Virtue 's Terra Incognita , Where none ever led the way , Nor ever since but in descriptions found ; Like the philosopher 's stone , With rules to search it , yet obtain 'd by none . II We have too long been led astray ; Too long have our misguided souls been taught With rules from musty morals brought , ‘ Tis you must put us in the way ; Let us ( for shame ! ) no more be fed With antique relics of the dead , The gleanings of philosophy ; Philosophy , the lumber of the schools , The roguery of alchymy ; And we , the bubbled fools , Spend all our present life , in hopes of golden rules . III But what does our proud ignorance Learning call ? We oddly Plato 's paradox make good , Our knowledge is but mere remembrance all ; Remembrance is our treasure and our food ; Nature 's fair table-book , our tender souls , We scrawl all o'er with old and empty rules , Stale memorandums of the schools : For learning 's mighty treasures look Into that deep grave , a book ; Think that she there does all her treasures hide , And that her troubled ghost still haunts there since she died ; Confine her walks to colleges and schools ; Her priests , her train , and followers , show As if they all were spectres too ! They purchase knowledge at th'expense Of common breeding , common sense , And grow at once scholars and fools ; Affect ill-manner 'd pedantry , Rudeness , ill-nature , incivility , And , sick with dregs and knowledge grown , Which greedily they swallow down , Still cast it up , and nauseate company . IV Curst be the wretch ! nay , doubly curst ! ( If it may lawful be To curse our greatest enemy ,) Who learn 'd himself that heresy first , ( Which since has seized on all the rest ,) That knowledge forfeits all humanity ; Taught us , like Spaniards , to be proud and poor , And fling our scraps before our door ! Thrice happy you have ‘ scaped this general pest ; Those mighty epithets , learned , good , and great , Which we ne'er join 'd before , but in romances meet , We find in you at last united grown . You cannot be compared to one : I must , like him that painted Venus ’ face , Borrow from every one a grace ; Virgil and Epicurus will not do , Their courting a retreat like you , Unless I put in Caesar 's learning too : Your happy frame at once controls This great triumvirate of souls . V Let not old Rome boast Fabius ’ fate ; He sav 'd his country by delays , But you by peace .<span corresp="#note1_2" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>You bought it at a cheaper rate ; Nor has it left the usual bloody scar , To show it cost its price in war ; War , that mad game the world so loves to play , And for it does so dearly pay ; For , though with loss , or victory , a while Fortune the gamesters does beguile , Yet at the last the box sweeps all away . VI Only the laurel got by peace No thunder e'er can blast : Th'artillery of the skies Shoots to the earth and dies : And ever green and flourishing ‘ twill last , Nor dipt in blood , nor widows ’ tears , nor orphans ’ cries . About the head crown 'd with these bays , Like lambent fire , the lightning plays ; Nor , its triumphal cavalcade to grace , Makes up its solemn train with death ; It melts the sword of war , yet keeps it in the sheath . VII The wily shafts of state , those jugglers ’ tricks , Which we call deep designs and politics , ( As in a theatre the ignorant fry , Because the cords escape their eye , Wonder to see the motions fly ,) Methinks , when you expose the scene , Down the ill-organ 'd engines fall ; Off fly the vizards , and discover all : How plain I see through the deceit ! How shallow , and how gross , the cheat ! Look where the pulley 's tied above ! Great God ! ( said I ) what have I seen ! On what poor engines move The thoughts of monarchs and designs of states ! What petty motives rule their fates ! How the mouse makes the mighty mountains shake ! The mighty mountain labours with its birth , Away the frighten 'd peasants fly , Scared at the unheard-of prodigy , Expect some great gigantic son of earth ; Lo ! it appears ! See how they tremble ! how they quake ! Out starts the little beast , and mocks their idle fears . VIII Then tell , dear favourite Muse ! What serpent 's that which still resorts , Still lurks in palaces and courts ? Take thy unwonted flight , And on the terrace light . See where she lies ! See how she rears her head , And rolls about her dreadful eyes , To drive all virtue out , or look it dead ! ‘ Twas sure this basilisk sent Temple thence , And though as some ( ‘ tis said ) for their defence Have worn a casement o'er their skin , So wore he his within , Made up of virtue and transparent innocence ; And though he oft renew 'd the fight , And almost got priority of sight , He ne'er could overcome her quite , In pieces cut , the viper still did reunite ; Till , at last , tired with loss of time and ease , Resolved to give himself , as well as country , peace . IX Sing , beloved Muse ! the pleasures of retreat , And in some untouch 'd virgin strain , Show the delights thy sister Nature yields ; Sing of thy vales , sing of thy woods , sing of thy fields ; Go , publish o'er the plain How mighty a proselyte you gain ! How noble a reprisal on the great ! How is the Muse luxuriant grown ! Whene'er she takes this flight , She soars clear out of sight . These are the paradises of her own : Thy Pegasus , like an unruly horse , Though ne'er so gently led , To the loved pastures where he used to feed , Runs violent o'er his usual course . Wake from thy wanton dreams , Come from thy dear-loved streams , The crooked paths of wandering Thames . Fain the fair nymph would stay , Oft she looks back in vain , Oft ‘ gainst her fountain does complain , And softly steals in many windings down , As loth to see the hated court and town ; And murmurs as she glides away . X In this new happy scene Are nobler subjects for your learned pen ; Here we expect from you More than your predecessor Adam knew ; Whatever moves our wonder , or our sport , Whatever serves for innocent emblems of the court ; How that which we a kernel see , ( Whose well-compacted forms escape the light , Unpierced by the blunt rays of sight ,) Shall ere long grow into a tree ; Whence takes it its increase , and whence its birth , Or from the sun , or from the air , or from the earth , Where all the fruitful atoms lie ; How some go downward to the root , Some more ambitious upwards fly , And form the leaves , the branches , and the fruit . You strove to cultivate a barren court in vain , Your garden 's better worth your nobler pain , Here mankind fell , and hence must rise again . XI Shall I believe a spirit so divine Was cast in the same mould with mine ? Why then does Nature so unjustly share Among her elder sons the whole estate , And all her jewels and her plate ? Poor we ! cadets of Heaven , not worth her care , Take up at best with lumber and the leavings of a fare : Some she binds ‘ prentice to the spade , Some to the drudgery of a trade : Some she does to Egyptian bondage draw , Bids us make bricks , yet sends us to look out for straw : Some she condemns for life to try To dig the leaden mines of deep philosophy : Me she has to the Muse 's galleys tied : In vain I strive to cross the spacious main , In vain I tug and pull the oar ; And when I almost reach the shore , Straight the Muse turns the helm , and I launch out again : And yet , to feed my pride , Whene'er I mourn , stops my complaining breath , With promise of a mad reversion after death . XII Then , Sir , accept this worthless verse , The tribute of an humble Muse , ‘ Tis all the portion of my niggard stars ; Nature the hidden spark did at my birth infuse , And kindled first with indolence and ease ; And since too oft debauch 'd by praise , ‘ Tis now grown an incurable disease : In vain to quench this foolish fire I try In wisdom and philosophy : In vain all wholesome herbs I sow , Where nought but weeds will grow Whate'er I plant ( like corn on barren earth ) By an equivocal birth , Seeds , and runs up to poetry .

      <head>TO MR. CONGREVE</head>
      <head>WRITTEN IN NOVEMBER , 1693</head>
       <l n="1">Thrice , with a prophet 's voice , and prophet 's power ,</l>
       <l n="2">The Muse was called in a poetic hour ,</l>
       <l n="3">And insolently thrice the slighted maid</l>
       <l n="4">Dared to suspend her unregarded aid ;</l>
       <l n="5">Then with that grief we form in spirits divine ,</l>
       <l n="6">Pleads for her own neglect , and thus reproaches mine .</l>
       <l n="7">Once highly honoured ! false is the pretence</l>
       <l n="8">You make to truth , retreat , and innocence !</l>
       <l n="9">Who , to pollute my shades , bring'st with thee down</l>
       <l n="10">The most ungenerous vices of the town ;</l>
       <l n="11">Ne'er sprung a youth from out this isle before</l>
       <l n="12">I once esteem 'd , and loved , and favour 'd more ,</l>
       <l n="13">Nor ever maid endured such courtlike scorn ,</l>
       <l n="14">So much in mode , so very city-born ;</l>
       <l n="15">‘ Tis with a foul design the Muse you send ,</l>
       <l n="16">Like a cast mistress , to your wicked friend ;</l>
       <l n="17">But find some new address , some fresh deceit ,</l>
       <l n="18">Nor practise such an antiquated cheat ;</l>
       <l n="19">These are the beaten methods of the stews ,</l>
       <l n="20">Stale forms , of course , all mean deceivers use ,</l>
       <l n="21">Who barbarously think to ‘ scape reproach ,</l>
       <l n="22">By prostituting her they first debauch .</l>
       <l n="23">Thus did the Muse severe unkindly blame</l>
       <l n="24">This offering long design 'd to Congreve 's fame ;</l>
       <l n="25">First chid the zeal as unpoetic fire ,</l>
       <l n="26">Which soon his merit forced her to inspire ;</l>
       <l n="27">Then call this verse , that speaks her largest aid ,</l>
       <l n="28">The greatest compliment she ever made ,</l>
       <l n="29">And wisely judge , no power beneath divine</l>
       <l n="30">Could leap the bounds which part your world and mine ;</l>
       <l n="31">For , youth , believe , to you unseen , is fix 'd</l>
       <l n="32">A mighty gulf , unpassable betwixt .</l>
       <l n="33">Nor tax the goddess of a mean design</l>
       <l n="34">To praise your parts by publishing of mine ;</l>
       <l n="35">That be my thought when some large bulky writ</l>
       <l n="36">Shows in the front the ambition of my wit ;</l>
       <l n="37">There to surmount what bears me up , and sing</l>
       <l n="38">Like the victorious wren perch 'd on the eagle 's wing .</l>
       <l n="39">This could I do , and proudly o'er him tower ,</l>
       <l n="40">Were my desires but heighten 'd to my power .</l>
       <l n="41">Godlike the force of my young Congreve 's bays ,</l>
       <l n="42">Softening the Muse 's thunder into praise ;</l>
       <l n="43">Sent to assist an old unvanquish 'd pride</l>
       <l n="44">That looks with scorn on half mankind beside ;</l>
       <l n="45">A pride that well suspends poor mortals ’ fate ,</l>
       <l n="46">Gets between them and my resentment 's weight ,</l>
       <l n="47">Stands in the gap ‘ twixt me and wretched men ,</l>
       <l n="48">T'avert th'impending judgments of my pen .</l>
       <l n="49">Thus I look down with mercy on the age ,</l>
       <l n="50">By hopes my Congreve will reform the stage :</l>
       <l n="51">For never did poetic mind before</l>
       <l n="52">Produce a richer vein , or cleaner ore ;</l>
       <l n="53">The bullion stamp 'd in your refining mind</l>
       <l n="54">Serves by retail to furnish half mankind .</l>
       <l n="55">With indignation I behold your wit</l>
       <l n="56">Forced on me , crack 'd , and clipp 'd , and counterfeit ,</l>
       <l n="57">By vile pretenders , who a stock maintain</l>
       <l n="58">From broken scraps and filings of your brain .</l>
       <l n="59">Through native dross your share is hardly known ,</l>
       <l n="60">And by short views mistook for all their own ;</l>
       <l n="61">So small the gains those from your wit do reap ,</l>
       <l n="62">Who blend it into folly 's larger heap ,</l>
       <l n="63">Like the sun 's scatter 'd beams which loosely pass ,</l>
       <l n="64">When some rough hand breaks the assembling glass .</l>
       <l n="65">Yet want your critics no just cause to rail ,</l>
       <l n="66">Since knaves are ne'er obliged for what they steal .</l>
       <l n="67">These pad on wit 's high road , and suits maintain</l>
       <l n="68">With those they rob , by what their trade does gain .</l>
       <l n="69">Thus censure seems that fiery froth which breeds</l>
       <l n="70">O'er the sun 's face , and from his heat proceeds ,</l>
       <l n="71">Crusts o'er the day , shadowing its partent beam ,</l>
       <l n="72">As ancient nature 's modern masters dream ;</l>
       <l n="73">This bids some curious praters here below</l>
       <l n="74">Call Titan sick , because their sight is so ;</l>
       <l n="75">And well , methinks , does this allusion fit</l>
       <l n="76">To scribblers , and the god of light and wit ;</l>
       <l n="77">Those who by wild delusions entertain</l>
       <l n="78">A lust of rhyming for a poet 's vein ,</l>
       <l n="79">Raise envy 's clouds to leave themselves in night ,</l>
       <l n="80">But can no more obscure my Congreve 's light ,</l>
       <l n="81">Than swarms of gnats , that wanton in a ray</l>
       <l n="82">Which gave them birth , can rob the world of day .</l>
       <l n="83">What northern hive pour 'd out these foes to wit ?</l>
       <l n="84">Whence came these Goths to overrun the pit ?</l>
       <l n="85">How would you blush the shameful birth to hear</l>
       <l n="86">Of those you so ignobly stoop to fear ;</l>
       <l n="87">For , ill to them , long have I travell 'd since ,</l>
       <l n="88">Round all the circles of impertinence ,</l>
       <l n="89">Search 'd in the nest where every worm did lie</l>
       <l n="90">Before it grew a city butterfly ;</l>
       <l n="91">I 'm sure I found them other kind of things</l>
       <l n="92">Than those with backs of silk and golden wings ;</l>
       <l n="93">A search , no doubt , as curious and as wise</l>
       <l n="94">As virtuosoes ’ in dissecting flies :</l>
       <l n="95">For , could you think ? the fiercest foes you dread ,</l>
       <l n="96">And court in prologues , all are country bred ;</l>
       <l n="97">Bred in my scene , and for the poet 's sins</l>
       <l n="98">Adjourn 'd from tops and grammar to the inns ;</l>
       <l n="99">Those beds of dung , where schoolboys sprout up beaux</l>
       <l n="100">Far sooner than the nobler mushroom grows :</l>
       <l n="101">These are the lords of the poetic schools ,</l>
       <l n="102">Who preach the saucy pedantry of rules ;</l>
       <l n="103">Those powers the critics , who may boast the odds</l>
       <l n="104">O'er Nile , with all its wilderness of gods ;</l>
       <l n="105">Nor could the nations kneel to viler shapes ,</l>
       <l n="106">Which worshipp 'd cats , and sacrificed to apes ;</l>
       <l n="107">And can you think the wise forbear to laugh</l>
       <l n="108">At the warm zeal that breeds this golden calf ?</l>
       <l n="109">Haply you judge these lines severely writ</l>
       <l n="110">Against the proud usurpers of the pit ;</l>
       <l n="111">Stay while I tell my story , short , and true ;</l>
       <l n="112">To draw conclusions shall be left to you ;</l>
       <l n="113">Nor need I ramble far to force a rule ,</l>
       <l n="114">But lay the scene just here at Farnham<span corresp="#note1_4" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>school .</l>
       <l n="115">Last year , a lad hence by his parents sent</l>
       <l n="116">With other cattle to the city went ;</l>
       <l n="117">Where having cast his coat , and well pursued</l>
       <l n="118">The methods most in fashion to be lewd ,</l>
       <l n="119">Return 'd a finish 'd spark this summer down ,</l>
       <l n="120">Stock 'd with the freshest gibberish of the town ;</l>
       <l n="121">A jargon form 'd from the lost language , wit ,</l>
       <l n="122">Confounded in that Babel of the pit ;</l>
       <l n="123">Form 'd by diseased conceptions , weak and wild ,</l>
       <l n="124">Sick lust of souls , and an abortive child ;</l>
       <l n="125">Born between whores and fops , by lewd compacts ,</l>
       <l n="126">Before the play , or else between the acts ;</l>
       <l n="127">Nor wonder , if from such polluted minds</l>
       <l n="128">Should spring such short and transitory kinds ,</l>
       <l n="129">Or crazy rules to make us wits by rote ,</l>
       <l n="130">Last just as long as every cuckoo 's note :</l>
       <l n="131">What bungling , rusty tools are used by fate !</l>
       <l n="132">‘ Twas in an evil hour to urge my hate ,</l>
       <l n="133">My hate , whose lash just Heaven has long decreed</l>
       <l n="134">Shall on a day make sin and folly bleed :</l>
       <l n="135">When man 's ill genius to my presence sent</l>
       <l n="136">This wretch , to rouse my wrath , for ruin meant ;</l>
       <l n="137">Who in his idiom vile , with Gray'shYpppHeNInn grace ,</l>
       <l n="138">Squander 'd his noisy talents to my face ;</l>
       <l n="139">Named every player on his fingers ’ ends ,</l>
       <l n="140">Swore all the wits were his peculiar friends ;</l>
       <l n="141">Talk 'd with that saucy and familiar ease</l>
       <l n="142">Of Wycherly , and you , and Mr. Bayes :[ 2 ]</l>
       <l n="143">Said , how a late report your friends had vex 'd ,</l>
       <l n="144">Who heard you meant to write heroics next ;</l>
       <l n="145">For , tragedy , he knew , would lose you quite ,</l>
       <l n="146">And told you so at Will 's<span corresp="#note3_2" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>but t'other night .</l>
       <l n="147">Thus are the lives of fools a sort of dreams ,</l>
       <l n="148">Rendering shades things , and substances of names ;</l>
       <l n="149">Such high companions may delusion keep ,</l>
       <l n="150">Lords are a footboy 's cronies in his sleep .</l>
       <l n="151">As a fresh miss , by fancy , face , and gown ,</l>
       <l n="152">Render 'd the topping beauty of the town ,</l>
       <l n="153">Draws every rhyming , prating , dressing sot ,</l>
       <l n="154">To boast of favours that he never got ;</l>
       <l n="155">Of which , whoe'er lacks confidence to prate ,</l>
       <l n="156">Brings his good parts and breeding in debate ;</l>
       <l n="157">And not the meanest coxcomb you can find ,</l>
       <l n="158">But thanks his stars , that Phillis has been kind ;</l>
       <l n="159">Thus prostitute my Congreve 's name is grown</l>
       <l n="160">To every lewd pretender of the town .</l>
       <l n="161">Troth , I could pity you ; but this is it ,</l>
       <l n="162">You find , to be the fashionable wit ;</l>
       <l n="163">These are the slaves whom reputation chains ,</l>
       <l n="164">Whose maintenance requires no help from brains .</l>
       <l n="165">For , should the vilest scribbler to the pit ,</l>
       <l n="166">Whom sin and want e'er furnish 'd out a wit ;</l>
       <l n="167">Whose name must not within my lines be shown ,</l>
       <l n="168">Lest here it live , when perish 'd with his own ;<span corresp="#note4_2" type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span></l>
       <l n="169">Should such a wretch usurp my Congreve 's place ,</l>
       <l n="170">And choose out wits who ne'er have seen his face ;</l>
       <l n="171">I 'll bet my life but the dull cheat would pass ,</l>
       <l n="172">Nor need the lion 's skin conceal the ass ;</l>
       <l n="173">Yes , that beau 's look , that vice , those critic ears ,</l>
       <l n="174">Must needs be right , so well resembling theirs .</l>
       <l n="175">Perish the Muse 's hour thus vainly spent</l>
       <l n="176">In satire , to my Congreve 's praises meant ;</l>
       <l n="177">In how ill season her resentments rule ,</l>
       <l n="178">What 's that to her if mankind be a fool ?</l>
       <l n="179">Happy beyond a private Muse 's fate ,</l>
       <l n="180">In pleasing all that 's good among the great ,<span corresp="#note5_2" type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span></l>
       <l n="181">Where though her elder sisters crowding throng ,</l>
       <l n="182">She still is welcome with her innocent song ;</l>
       <l n="183">Whom were my Congreve blest to see and know ,</l>
       <l n="184">What poor regards would merit all below !</l>
       <l n="185">How proudly would he haste the joy to meet ,</l>
       <l n="186">And drop his laurel at Apollo 's feet !</l>
       <l n="187">Here by a mountain 's side , a reverend cave</l>
       <l n="188">Gives murmuring passage to a lasting wave :</l>
       <l n="189">‘ Tis the world 's watery hour-glass streaming fast ,</l>
       <l n="190">Time is no more when th'utmost drop is past ;</l>
       <l n="191">Here , on a better day , some druid dwelt ,</l>
       <l n="192">And the young Muse 's early favour felt ;</l>
       <l n="193">Druid , a name she does with pride repeat ,</l>
       <l n="194">Confessing Albion once her darling seat ;</l>
       <l n="195">Far in this primitive cell might we pursue</l>
       <l n="196">Our predecessors ’ footsteps still in view ;</l>
       <l n="197">Here would we sing — But , ah ! you think I dream ,</l>
       <l n="198">And the bad world may well believe the same ;</l>
       <l n="199">Yes : you are all malicious slanders by ,</l>
       <l n="200">While two fond lovers prate , the Muse and I .</l>
       <l n="201">Since thus I wander from my first intent ,</l>
       <l n="202">Nor am that grave adviser which I meant ,</l>
       <l n="203">Take this short lesson from the god of bays ,</l>
       <l n="204">And let my friend apply it as he please :</l>
       <l n="205">Beat not the dirty paths where vulgar feet have trod ,</l>
       <l n="206">But give the vigorous fancy room .</l>
       <l n="207">For when , like stupid alchymists , you try</l>
       <l n="208">To fix this nimble god ,</l>
       <l n="209">This volatile mercury ,</l>
       <l n="210">The subtile spirit all flies up in fume ;</l>
       <l n="211">Nor shall the bubbled virtuoso find</l>
       <l n="212">More than fade insipid mixture left behind .<span corresp="#note6" type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span></l>
       <l n="213">While thus I write , vast shoals of critics come ,</l>
       <l n="214">And on my verse pronounce their saucy doom ;</l>
       <l n="215">The Muse like some bright country virgin shows</l>
       <l n="216">Fallen by mishap among a knot of beaux ;</l>
       <l n="217">They , in their lewd and fashionable prate ,</l>
       <l n="218">Rally her dress , her language , and her gait ;</l>
       <l n="219">Spend their base coin before the bashful maid ,</l>
       <l n="220">Current like copper , and as often paid :</l>
       <l n="221">She , who on shady banks has joy 'd to sleep</l>
       <l n="222">Near better animals , her father 's sheep ,</l>
       <l n="223">Shamed and amazed , beholds the chattering throng ,</l>
       <l n="224">To think what cattle she is got among ;</l>
       <l n="225">But with the odious smell and sight annoy 'd ,</l>
       <l n="226">In haste she does th'offensive herd avoid .</l>
       <l n="227">‘ Tis time to bid my friend a long farewell ,</l>
       <l n="228">The muse retreats far in yon crystal cell ;</l>
       <l n="229">Faint inspiration sickens as she flies ,</l>
       <l n="230">Like distant echo spent , the spirit dies .</l>
       <l n="231">In this descending sheet you 'll haply find</l>
       <l n="232">Some short refreshment for your weary mind ,</l>
       <l n="233">Nought it contains is common or unclean ,</l>
       <l n="234">And once drawn up , is ne'er let down again .<span corresp="#note7" type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span></l>

       <l n="1">Strange to conceive , how the same objects strike</l>

       <l n="3">Whether in time , Deduction 's broken chain</l>
       <l n="4">Meets , and salutes her sister link again ;</l>
       <l n="5">Or haunted Fancy , by a circling flight ,</l>
       <l n="6">Comes back with joy to its own seat at night ;</l>
       <l n="7">Or whether dead Imagination 's ghost</l>
       <l n="8">Oft hovers where alive it haunted most ;</l>
       <l n="9">Or if Thought 's rolling globe , her circle run ,</l>
       <l n="10">Turns up old objects to the soul her sun ;</l>
       <l n="11">Or loves the Muse to walk with conscious pride</l>
       <l n="12">O'er the glad scene whence first she rose a bride :</l>
       <l n="13">Be what it will ; late near yon whispering stream ,</l>
       <l n="14">Where her own Temple was her darling theme ;</l>
       <l n="15">There first the visionary sound was heard ,</l>
       <l n="16">When to poetic view the Muse appear 'd .</l>
       <l n="17">Such seem 'd her eyes , as when an evening ray</l>
       <l n="18">Gives glad farewell to a tempestuous day ;</l>
       <l n="19">Weak is the beam to dry up Nature 's tears ,</l>
       <l n="20">Still every tree the pendent sorrow wears ;</l>
       <l n="21">Such are the smiles where drops of crystal show</l>
       <l n="22">Approaching joy at strife with parting woe .</l>
       <l n="23">As when , to scare th'ungrateful or the proud ,</l>
       <l n="24">Tempests long frown , and thunder threatens loud ,</l>
       <l n="25">Till the blest sun , to give kind dawn of grace ,</l>
       <l n="26">Darts weeping beams across Heaven 's watery face ;</l>
       <l n="27">When soon the peaceful bow unstring 'd is shown ,</l>
       <l n="28">A sign God 's dart is shot , and wrath o'erblown :</l>
       <l n="29">Such to unhallow 'd sight the Muse divine</l>
       <l n="30">Might seem , when first she raised her eyes to mine .</l>
       <l n="31">What mortal change does in thy face appear ,</l>
       <l n="32">Lost youth , she cried , since first I met thee here !</l>
       <l n="33">With how undecent clouds are overcast</l>
       <l n="34">Thy looks , when every cause of grief is past !</l>
       <l n="35">Unworthy the glad tidings which I bring ,</l>
       <l n="36">Listen while the Muse thus teaches thee to sing :</l>
       <l n="37">As parent earth , burst by imprison 'd winds ,</l>
       <l n="38">Scatters strange agues o'er men 's sickly minds ,</l>
       <l n="39">And shakes the atheist 's knees ; such ghastly fear</l>
       <l n="40">Late I beheld on every face appear ;</l>
       <l n="41">Mild Dorothea ,<span corresp="#note1_5" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>peaceful , wise , and great ,</l>
       <l n="42">Trembling beheld the doubtful hand of fate ;</l>
       <l n="43">Mild Dorothea , whom we both have long</l>
       <l n="44">Not dared to injure with our lowly song ;</l>
       <l n="45">Sprung from a better world , and chosen then</l>
       <l n="46">The best companion for the best of men :</l>
       <l n="47">As some fair pile , yet spared by zeal and rage ,</l>
       <l n="48">Lives pious witness of a better age ;</l>
       <l n="49">So men may see what once was womankind ,</l>
       <l n="50">In the fair shrine of Dorothea 's mind .</l>
       <l n="51">You that would grief describe , come here and trace</l>
       <l n="52">Its watery footsteps in Dorinda 's<span corresp="#note2_2" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>face :</l>
       <l n="53">Grief from Dorinda 's face does ne'er depart</l>
       <l n="54">Farther than its own palace in her heart :</l>
       <l n="55">Ah , since our fears are fled , this insolent expel ,</l>
       <l n="56">At least confine the tyrant to his cell .</l>
       <l n="57">And if so black the cloud that Heaven 's bright queen</l>
       <l n="58">Shrouds her still beams ; how should the stars be seen ?</l>
       <l n="59">Thus when Dorinda wept , joy every face forsook ,</l>
       <l n="60">And grief flung sables on each menial look ;</l>
       <l n="61">The humble tribe mourn 'd for the quick'ning soul ,</l>
       <l n="62">That furnish 'd spirit and motion through the whole ;</l>
       <l n="63">So would earth 's face turn pale , and life decay ,</l>
       <l n="64">Should Heaven suspend to act but for a day ;</l>
       <l n="65">So nature 's crazed convulsions make us dread</l>
       <l n="66">That time is sick , or the world 's mind is dead .—</l>
       <l n="67">Take , youth , these thoughts , large matter to employ</l>
       <l n="68">The fancy furnish 'd by returning joy ;</l>
       <l n="69">And to mistaken man these truths rehearse ,</l>
       <l n="70">Who dare revile the integrity of verse :</l>
       <l n="71">Ah , favourite youth , how happy is thy lot !—</l>
       <l n="72">But I 'm deceived , or thou regard'st me not ;</l>
       <l n="73">Speak , for I wait thy answer , and expect</l>
       <l n="74">Thy just submission for this bold neglect .</l>
       <l n="75">Unknown the forms we the high-priesthood use</l>
       <l n="76">At the divine appearance of the Muse ,</l>
       <l n="77">Which to divulge might shake profane belief ,</l>
       <l n="78">And tell the irreligion of my grief ;</l>
       <l n="79">Grief that excused the tribute of my knees ,</l>
       <l n="80">And shaped my passion in such words as these !</l>
       <l n="81">Malignant goddess ! bane to my repose ,</l>
       <l n="82">Thou universal cause of all my woes ;</l>
       <l n="83">Say whence it comes that thou art grown of late</l>
       <l n="84">A poor amusement for my scorn and hate ;</l>
       <l n="85">The malice thou inspirest I never fail</l>
       <l n="86">On thee to wreak the tribute when I rail ;</l>
       <l n="87">Fool 's commonplace thou art , their weak ensconcing fort ,</l>
       <l n="88">Th'appeal of dulness in the last resort :</l>
       <l n="89">Heaven , with a parent 's eye regarding earth ,</l>
       <l n="90">Deals out to man the planet of his birth :</l>
       <l n="91">But sees thy meteor blaze about me shine ,</l>
       <l n="92">And passing o'er , mistakes thee still for mine :</l>
       <l n="93">Ah , should I tell a secret yet unknown ,</l>
       <l n="94">That thou ne'er hadst a being of thy own ,</l>
       <l n="95">But a wild form dependent on the brain ,</l>
       <l n="96">Scattering loose features o'er the optic vein ;</l>
       <l n="97">Troubling the crystal fountain of the sight ,</l>
       <l n="98">Which darts on poets ’ eyes a trembling light ;</l>
       <l n="99">Kindled while reason sleeps , but quickly flies ,</l>
       <l n="100">Like antic shapes in dreams , from waking eyes :</l>
       <l n="101">In sum , a glitt'ring voice , a painted name ,</l>
       <l n="102">A walking vapour , like thy sister fame .</l>
       <l n="103">But if thou be'st what thy mad votaries prate ,</l>
       <l n="104">A female power , loose govern 'd thoughts create ;</l>
       <l n="105">Why near the dregs of youth perversely wilt thou stay ,</l>
       <l n="106">So highly courted by the brisk and gay ?</l>
       <l n="107">Wert thou right woman , thou should'st scorn to look</l>
       <l n="108">On an abandon 'd wretch by hopes forsook ;</l>
       <l n="109">Forsook by hopes , ill fortune 's last relief ,</l>
       <l n="110">Assign 'd for life to unremitting grief ;</l>
       <l n="111">For , let Heaven 's wrath enlarge these weary days ,</l>
       <l n="112">If hope e'er dawns the smallest of its rays .</l>
       <l n="113">Time o'er the happy takes so swift a flight ,</l>
       <l n="114">And treads so soft , so easy , and so light ,</l>
       <l n="115">That we the wretched , creeping far behind ,</l>
       <l n="116">Can scarce th'impression of his footsteps find ;</l>
       <l n="117">Smooth as that airy nymph so subtly born</l>
       <l n="118">With inoffensive feet o'er standing corn ;<span corresp="#note3_3" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span></l>
       <l n="119">Which bow 'd by evening breeze with bending stalks ,</l>
       <l n="120">Salutes the weary traveller as he walks ;</l>
       <l n="121">But o'er the afflicted with a heavy pace</l>
       <l n="122">Sweeps the broad scythe , and tramples on his face .</l>
       <l n="123">Down falls the summer 's pride , and sadly shows</l>
       <l n="124">Nature 's bare visage furrow 'd as he mows :</l>
       <l n="125">See , Muse , what havoc in these looks appear ,</l>
       <l n="126">These are the tyrant 's trophies of a year ;</l>
       <l n="127">Since hope his last and greatest foe is fled ,</l>
       <l n="128">Despair and he lodge ever in its stead ;</l>
       <l n="129">March o'er the ruin 'd plain with motion slow ,</l>
       <l n="130">Still scattering desolation where they go .</l>
       <l n="131">To thee I owe that fatal bent of mind ,</l>
       <l n="132">Still to unhappy restless thoughts inclined ;</l>
       <l n="133">To thee , what oft I vainly strive to hide ,</l>
       <l n="134">That scorn of fools , by fools mistook for pride ;</l>
       <l n="135">From thee whatever virtue takes its rise ,</l>
       <l n="136">Grows a misfortune , or becomes a vice ;</l>
       <l n="137">Such were thy rules to be poetically great :</l>
       <l n="138">“ Stoop not to interest , flattery , or deceit ;</l>
       <l n="139">Nor with hired thoughts be thy devotion paid ;</l>
       <l n="140">Learn to disdain their mercenary aid ;</l>
       <l n="141">Be this thy sure defence , thy brazen wall ,</l>
       <l n="142">Know no base action , at no guilt turn pale ;<span corresp="#note4_3" type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span></l>
       <l n="143">And since unhappy distance thus denies</l>
       <l n="144">T'expose thy soul , clad in this poor disguise ;</l>
       <l n="145">Since thy few ill-presented graces seem</l>
       <l n="146">To breed contempt where thou hast hoped esteem — ”</l>
       <l n="147">Madness like this no fancy ever seized ,</l>
       <l n="148">Still to be cheated , never to be pleased ;</l>
       <l n="149">Since one false beam of joy in sickly minds</l>
       <l n="150">Is all the poor content delusion finds .—</l>
       <l n="151">There thy enchantment broke , and from this hour</l>
       <l n="152">I here renounce thy visionary power ;</l>
       <l n="153">And since thy essence on my breath depends</l>
       <l n="154">Thus with a puff the whole delusion ends .</l>

     <p>MRS. FRANCES HARRIS 'S PETITION , 1699</p>
     <p>This , the most humorous example of vers de société in the English language , well illustrates the position of a parson in a family of distinction at that period .— W . E. B .</p>
     <p>To their Excellencies the Lords Justices of Ireland ,<span corresp="#note1_6" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>The humble petition of Frances Harris , Who must starve and die a maid if it miscarries ; Humbly sheweth , that I went to warm myself in Lady Betty 's<span corresp="#note2_3" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>chamber , because I was cold ; And I had in a purse seven pounds , four shillings , and sixpence , ( besides farthings ) in money and gold ; So because I had been buying things for my lady last night , I was resolved to tell my money , to see if it was right . Now , you must know , because my trunk has a very bad lock , Therefore all the money I have , which , God knows , is a very small stock , I keep in my pocket , ty 'd about my middle , next my smock . So when I went to put up my purse , as God would have it , my smock was unript , And instead of putting it into my pocket , down it slipt ; Then the bell rung , and I went down to put my lady to bed ; And , God knows , I thought my money was as safe as my maidenhead . So , when I came up again , I found my pocket feel very light ; But when I search 'd , and miss 'd my purse , Lord ! I thought I should have sunk outright . “ Lord ! madam , ” says Mary , “ how d'ye do ? ” — “ Indeed , ” says I , “ never worse : But pray , Mary , can you tell what I have done with my purse ? ” “ Lord help me ! ” says Mary , “ I never stirr 'd out of this place ! ” “ Nay , ” said I , “ I had it in Lady Betty 's chamber , that 's a plain case . ” So Mary got me to bed , and cover 'd me up warm : However , she stole away my garters , that I might do myself no harm . So I tumbled and toss 'd all night , as you may very well think , But hardly ever set my eyes together , or slept a wink . So I was a-dream 'd , methought , that I went and search 'd the folks round , And in a corner of Mrs. Duke 's<span corresp="#note3_4" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>box , ty 'd in a rag , the money was found . So next morning we told Whittle ,<span corresp="#note4_4" type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>and he fell a swearing : Then my dame Wadgar<span corresp="#note5_3" type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>came , and she , you know , is thick of hearing . “ Dame , ” said I , as loud as I could bawl , “ do you know what a loss I have had ? ” “ Nay , ” says she , “ my Lord Colway 's<span corresp="#note6_2" type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>folks are all very sad : For my Lord Dromedary<span corresp="#note7_2" type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>comes a Tuesday without fail . ” “ Pugh ! ” said I , “ but that 's not the business that I ail . ” Says Cary ,<span corresp="#note8" type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>says he , “ I have been a servant this five and twenty years come spring , And in all the places I lived I never heard of such a thing . ” “ Yes , ” says the steward ,<span corresp="#note9" type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>“ I remember when I was at my Lord Shrewsbury 's , Such a thing as this happen 'd , just about the time of gooseberries . ” So I went to the party suspected , and I found her full of grief : ( Now , you must know , of all things in the world I hate a thief :) However , I was resolved to bring the discourse slily about : “ Mrs. Duke , ” said I , “ here 's an ugly accident has happened out : ‘ Tis not that I value the money three skips of a louse :[ 10 ] But the thing I stand upon is the credit of the house . ‘ Tis true , seven pounds , four shillings , and sixpence makes a great hole in my wages : Besides , as they say , service is no inheritance in these ages . Now , Mrs. Duke , you know , and everybody understands , That though ‘ tis hard to judge , yet money can n't go without hands . ” “ The devil take me ! ” said she , ( blessing herself ,) “ if ever I saw't ! ” So she roar 'd like a bedlam , as thof I had call 'd her all to naught . So , you know , what could I say to her any more ? I e'en left her , and came away as wise as I was before . Well ; but then they would have had me gone to the cunning man : “ No , ” said I , “ ‘ tis the same thing , the CHAPLAIN<span corresp="#note11" type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>will be here anon . ” So the Chaplain came in . Now the servants say he is my sweetheart , Because he 's always in my chamber , and I always take his part . So , as the devil would have it , before I was aware , out I blunder 'd , “ Parson ” said I , “ can you cast a nativity , when a body 's plunder 'd ? ” ( Now you must know , he hates to be called Parson , like the devil ! ) “ Truly , ” says he , “ Mrs. Nab , it might become you to be more civil ; If your money be gone , as a learned Divine says ,<span corresp="#note12" type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span>d'ye see , You are no text for my handling ; so take that from me : I was never taken for a Conjurer before , I 'd have you to know . ” “ Lord ! ” said I , “ do n't be angry , I am sure I never thought you so ; You know I honour the cloth ; I design to be a Parson 's wife ; I never took one in your coat for a conjurer in all my life . ” With that he twisted his girdle at me like a rope , as who should say , “ Now you may go hang yourself for me ! ” and so went away . Well : I thought I should have swoon 'd . “ Lord ! ” said I , “ what shall I do ? I have lost my money , and shall lose my true love too ! ” Then my lord call 'd me : “ Harry ,"[ 13 ] said my lord , “ do n't cry ; I 'll give you something toward thy loss . ” “ And , ” says my lady , “ so will I . ” Oh ! but , said I , what if , after all , the Chaplain wo n't come to ? For that , he said ( a n't please your Excellencies ) , I must petition you . The premisses tenderly consider 'd , I desire your Excellencies ’ protection , And that I may have a share in next Sunday 's collection ; And , over and above , that I may have your Excellencies ’ letter , With an order for the Chaplain aforesaid , or , instead of him , a better : And then your poor petitioner , both night and day , Or the Chaplain ( for ‘ tis his trade , [ 14 ]) as in duty bound , shall ever pray .</p>

       <l n="6">As we say Monsieur to an ape ,</l>
       <l n="7">Without offence to human shape ;</l>
       <l n="8">So men have got , from bird and brute ,</l>
       <l n="9">Names that would best their nature suit .</l>
       <l n="10">The Lion , Eagle , Fox , and Boar ,</l>
       <l n="11">Were heroes ’ titles heretofore ,</l>
       <l n="12">Bestow 'd as hi'roglyphics fit</l>

       <l n="14">For what is understood by fame ,</l>
       <l n="15">Besides the getting of a name ?</l>
       <l n="16">But , e'er since men invented guns ,</l>
       <l n="17">A diff'rent way their fancy runs :</l>
       <l n="18">To paint a hero , we inquire</l>
       <l n="19">For something that will conquer fire .</l>
       <l n="20">Would you describe Turenne<span corresp="#note1_10" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>or Trump ?<span corresp="#note2_7" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span></l>
       <l n="21">Think of a bucket or a pump .</l>

       <l n="24">‘ Tis well ;— but since we live among</l>

       <l n="26">Who may object against the term ,</l>
       <l n="27">Pliny shall prove what we affirm :</l>
       <l n="28">Pliny shall prove , and we 'll apply ,</l>
       <l n="29">And I 'll be judg 'd by standers by .</l>
       <l n="30">First , then , our author has defined</l>
       <l n="31">This reptile of the serpent kind ,</l>
       <l n="32">With gaudy coat , and shining train ;</l>
       <l n="33">But loathsome spots his body stain :</l>
       <l n="34">Out from some hole obscure he flies ,</l>
       <l n="35">When rains descend , and tempests rise ,</l>
       <l n="36">Till the sun clears the air ; and then</l>
       <l n="37">Crawls back neglected to his den .<span corresp="#note4_7" type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span></l>
       <l n="38">So , when the war has raised a storm ,</l>
       <l n="39">I 've seen a snake in human form ,</l>
       <l n="40">All stain 'd with infamy and vice ,</l>
       <l n="41">Leap from the dunghill in a trice ,</l>
       <l n="42">Burnish and make a gaudy show ,</l>
       <l n="43">Become a general , peer , and beau ,</l>
       <l n="44">Till peace has made the sky serene ,</l>
       <l n="45">Then shrink into its hole again .</l>
       <l n="46">“ All this we grant — why then , look yonder ,</l>
       <l n="47">Sure that must be a Salamander ! ”</l>
       <l n="48">Further , we are by Pliny told ,</l>
       <l n="49">This serpent is extremely cold ;</l>
       <l n="50">So cold , that , put it in the fire ,</l>
       <l n="51">‘ Twill make the very flames expire :</l>
       <l n="52">Besides , it spues a filthy froth</l>
       <l n="53">( Whether thro ’ rage or lust or both )</l>
       <l n="54">Of matter purulent and white ,</l>
       <l n="55">Which , happening on the skin to light ,</l>

     <note xml:id="note1_12" place="bottom" n="1">Some ladies , among whom were Mrs. Worsley and Mrs. Finch , to the latter of whom Swift addressed , under the name of Ardelia , the preceding poem , appear to have written verses to him from May Fair , offering him such temptations as that fashionable locality supplied to detain him from the country and its pleasures : and thus he replies .— Forster .</note>

      <head>BUILT FROM THE RUINS OF WHITEHALL THAT WAS BURNT , 1703</head>
       <l n="1">In times of old , when Time was young ,</l>
       <l n="2">And poets their own verses sung ,</l>
       <l n="3">A verse would draw a stone or beam ,</l>
       <l n="4">That now would overload a team ;</l>
       <l n="5">Lead ‘ em a dance of many a mile ,</l>
       <l n="6">Then rear ‘ em to a goodly pile .</l>
       <l n="7">Each number had its diff'rent power ;</l>
       <l n="8">Heroic strains could build a tower ;</l>
       <l n="9">Sonnets and elegies to Chloris ,</l>
       <l n="10">Might raise a house about two stories ;</l>
       <l n="11">A lyric ode would slate ; a catch</l>
       <l n="12">Would tile ; an epigram would thatch .</l>
       <l n="13">Now Poets feel this art is lost ,</l>
       <l n="14">Both to their own and landlord 's cost .</l>
       <l n="15">Not one of all the tuneful throng</l>
       <l n="16">Can hire a lodging for a song .</l>
       <l n="17">For Jove consider 'd well the case ,</l>
       <l n="18">That poets were a numerous race ;</l>
       <l n="19">And if they all had power to build ,</l>
       <l n="20">The earth would very soon be fill 'd :</l>
       <l n="21">Materials would be quickly spent ,</l>
       <l n="22">And houses would not give a rent .</l>
       <l n="23">The God of Wealth was therefore made</l>
       <l n="24">Sole patron of the building trade ;</l>
       <l n="25">Leaving to wits the spacious air ,</l>
       <l n="26">With license to build castles there :</l>
       <l n="27">In right whereof their old pretence</l>
       <l n="28">To lodge in garrets comes from thence .</l>
       <l n="29">There is a worm by Phoebus bred ,</l>
       <l n="30">By leaves of mulberry is fed ,</l>
       <l n="31">Which unprovided where to dwell ,</l>
       <l n="32">Conforms itself to weave a cell ;</l>
       <l n="33">Then curious hands this texture take ,</l>
       <l n="34">And for themselves fine garments make .</l>
       <l n="35">Meantime a pair of awkward things</l>
       <l n="36">Grow to his back instead of wings ;</l>
       <l n="37">He flutters when he thinks he flies ,</l>
       <l n="38">Then sheds about his spawn and dies .</l>
       <l n="39">Just such an insect of the age</l>
       <l n="40">Is he that scribbles for the stage ;</l>
       <l n="41">His birth he does from Phoebus raise ,</l>
       <l n="42">And feeds upon imagin 'd bays ;</l>
       <l n="43">Throws all his wit and hours away</l>
       <l n="44">In twisting up an ill spun Play :</l>
       <l n="45">This gives him lodging and provides</l>
       <l n="46">A stock of tawdry shift besides .</l>
       <l n="47">With the unravell 'd shreds of which</l>
       <l n="48">The under wits adorn their speech :</l>
       <l n="49">And now he spreads his little fans ,</l>
       <l n="50">( For all the Muses Geese are Swans )</l>
       <l n="51">And borne on Fancy 's pinions , thinks</l>
       <l n="52">He soars sublimest when he sinks :</l>
       <l n="53">But scatt'ring round his fly-blows , dies ;</l>
       <l n="54">Whence broods of insect-poets rise .</l>
       <l n="55">Premising thus , in modern way ,</l>
       <l n="56">The greater part I have to say ;</l>
       <l n="57">Sing , Muse , the house of Poet Van ,</l>
       <l n="58">In higher strain than we began .</l>
       <l n="59">Van ( for ‘ tis fit the reader know it )</l>
       <l n="60">Is both a Herald and a Poet ;</l>
       <l n="61">No wonder then if nicely skill 'd</l>
       <l n="62">In each capacity to build .</l>
       <l n="63">As Herald , he can in a day</l>
       <l n="64">Repair a house gone to decay ;</l>
       <l n="65">Or by achievements , arms , device ,</l>
       <l n="66">Erect a new one in a trice ;</l>
       <l n="67">And poets , if they had their due ,</l>
       <l n="68">By ancient right are builders too :</l>
       <l n="69">This made him to Apollo pray</l>
       <l n="70">For leave to build — the poets way .</l>
       <l n="71">His prayer was granted , for the God</l>
       <l n="72">Consented with the usual nod .</l>
       <l n="73">After hard throes of many a day</l>
       <l n="74">Van was delivered of a play ,</l>
       <l n="75">Which in due time brought forth a house ,</l>
       <l n="76">Just as the mountain did the mouse .</l>
       <l n="77">One story high , one postern door ,</l>
       <l n="78">And one small chamber on a floor ,</l>
       <l n="79">Born like a phoenix from the flame :</l>
       <l n="80">But neither bulk nor shape the same ;</l>
       <l n="81">As animals of largest size</l>
       <l n="82">Corrupt to maggots , worms , and flies ;</l>
       <l n="83">A type of modern wit and style ,</l>
       <l n="84">The rubbish of an ancient pile ;</l>
       <l n="85">So chemists boast they have a power ,</l>
       <l n="86">From the dead ashes of a flower</l>
       <l n="87">Some faint resemblance to produce ,</l>
       <l n="88">But not the virtue , taste , nor juice .</l>
       <l n="89">So modern rhymers strive to blast</l>
       <l n="90">The poetry of ages past ;</l>
       <l n="91">Which , having wisely overthrown ,</l>
       <l n="92">They from its ruins build their own .</l>

       <l n="35">No wonder then if nicely skill 'd</l>

       <l n="37">As Herald , he can in a day</l>

       <l n="41">And as a poet , he has skill</l>
       <l n="42">To build in speculation still .</l>
       <l n="43">“ Great Jove ! ” he cried , “ the art restore</l>
       <l n="44">To build by verse as heretofore ,</l>
       <l n="45">And make my Muse the architect ;</l>
       <l n="46">What palaces shall we erect !</l>
       <l n="47">No longer shall forsaken Thames</l>
       <l n="48">Lament his old Whitehall in flames ;</l>
       <l n="49">A pile shall from its ashes rise ,</l>
       <l n="50">Fit to invade or prop the skies . ”</l>
       <l n="51">Jove smiled , and , like a gentle god ,</l>
       <l n="52">Consenting with the usual nod ,</l>
       <l n="53">Told Van , he knew his talent best ,</l>
       <l n="54">And left the choice to his own breast .</l>
       <l n="55">So Van resolved to write a farce ;</l>
       <l n="56">But , well perceiving wit was scarce ,</l>
       <l n="57">With cunning that defect supplies :</l>
       <l n="58">Takes a French play as lawful prize ;<span corresp="#note3_8" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span></l>
       <l n="59">Steals thence his plot and ev'ry joke ,</l>
       <l n="60">Not once suspecting Jove would smoke ;</l>
       <l n="61">And ( like a wag set down to write )</l>
       <l n="62">Would whisper to himself , “ a bite . ”</l>
       <l n="63">Then , from this motley mingled style ,</l>
       <l n="64">Proceeded to erect his pile .</l>
       <l n="65">So men of old , to gain renown , did</l>
       <l n="66">Build Babel with their tongues confounded .</l>
       <l n="67">Jove saw the cheat , but thought it best</l>
       <l n="68">To turn the matter to a jest ;</l>
       <l n="69">Down from Olympus ’ top he slides ,</l>
       <l n="70">Laughing as if he 'd burst his sides :</l>
       <l n="71">Ay , thought the god , are these your tricks ,</l>
       <l n="72">Why then old plays deserve old bricks ;</l>
       <l n="73">And since you 're sparing of your stuff ,</l>
       <l n="74">Your building shall be small enough .</l>
       <l n="75">He spake , and grudging , lent his aid ;</l>
       <l n="76">Th'experienced bricks , that knew their trade ,</l>
       <l n="77">( As being bricks at second hand ,)</l>
       <l n="78">Now move , and now in order stand .</l>
       <l n="79">The building , as the Poet writ ,</l>
       <l n="80">Rose in proportion to his wit —</l>
       <l n="81">And first the prologue built a wall ;</l>
       <l n="82">So wide as to encompass all .</l>
       <l n="83">The scene , a wood , produc 'd no more</l>
       <l n="84">Than a few scrubby trees before .</l>
       <l n="85">The plot as yet lay deep ; and so</l>
       <l n="86">A cellar next was dug below ;</l>
       <l n="87">But this a work so hard was found ,</l>
       <l n="88">Two acts it cost him under ground .</l>
       <l n="89">Two other acts , we may presume ,</l>
       <l n="90">Were spent in building each a room .</l>
       <l n="91">Thus far advanc 'd , he made a shift</l>
       <l n="92">To raise a roof with act the fift .</l>
       <l n="93">The epilogue behind did frame</l>
       <l n="94">A place , not decent here to name .</l>
       <l n="95">Now , Poets from all quarters ran ,</l>
       <l n="96">To see the house of brother Van ;</l>
       <l n="97">Looked high and low , walk 'd often round ;</l>
       <l n="98">But no such house was to be found .</l>
       <l n="99">One asks the watermen hard by ,</l>
       <l n="100">“ Where may the Poet 's palace lie ? ”</l>
       <l n="101">Another of the Thames inquires ,</l>
       <l n="102">If he has seen its gilded spires ?</l>
       <l n="103">At length they in the rubbish spy</l>
       <l n="104">A thing resembling a goose-pie .</l>
       <l n="105">Thither in haste the Poets throng ,</l>
       <l n="106">And gaze in silent wonder long ,</l>
       <l n="107">Till one in raptures thus began</l>
       <l n="108">To praise the pile and builder Van :</l>
       <l n="109">“ Thrice happy Poet ! who may'st trail</l>
       <l n="110">Thy house about thee like a snail :</l>
       <l n="111">Or harness 'd to a nag , at ease</l>
       <l n="112">Take journeys in it like a chaise ;</l>

       <l n="116">Thou'rt well contrived , tho ’ thou art small :</l>
       <l n="117">For ev'ry Wit in Britain 's isle</l>
       <l n="118">May lodge within thy spacious pile .</l>
       <l n="119">Like Bacchus thou , as Poets feign ,</l>
       <l n="120">Thy mother burnt , art born again ,</l>
       <l n="121">Born like a phoenix from the flame :</l>

       <l n="50">To a small cottage came at last</l>

       <l n="57">Whilst he from out the chimney took</l>
       <l n="58">A flitch of bacon off the hook ,</l>

       <l n="64">Eat , honest friends , and never spare ,</l>
       <l n="65">And if we find our victuals fail ,</l>

       <l n="67">To a small kilderkin of beer ,</l>

       <l n="69">Philemon , by his wife 's consent ,</l>

       <l n="71">And having fill 'd it to the brink ,</l>
       <l n="72">Invited both the saints to drink .</l>
       <l n="73">When they had took a second draught ,</l>
       <l n="74">Behold , a miracle was wrought ;</l>
       <l n="75">For , Baucis with amazement found ,</l>
       <l n="76">Although the jug had twice gone round ,</l>
       <l n="77">It still was full up to the top ,</l>
       <l n="78">As they ne'er had drunk a drop .</l>
       <l n="79">You may be sure so strange a sight ,</l>
       <l n="80">Put the old people in a fright :</l>
       <l n="81">Philemon whisper 'd to his wife ,</l>
       <l n="82">“ These men are — Saints — I 'll lay my life ! ”</l>
       <l n="83">The strangers overheard , and said ,</l>

       <l n="90">And grow a church before your eyes . ”</l>
       <l n="91">Scarce had they spoke , when fair and soft ,</l>

     <note xml:id="note1_16" place="bottom" n="1">I here give the original version of this poem , which Forster found in Swift 's handwriting at Narford ; and which has never been published . It is well known that , at Addison 's suggestion , Swift made extensive changes in this , “ one of the happiest of his poems , ” concerning which Forster says , in his “ Life of Swift , ” at p. 165 : “ The poem , as printed , contains one hundred and seventy-eight lines ; the poem , as I found it at Narford , has two hundred and thirty ; and the changes in the latter bringing it into the condition of the former , by which only it has been thus far known , comprise the omission of ninety-six lines , the addition of forty-four , and the alteration of twenty-two . The question can now be discussed whether or not the changes were improvements , and , in my opinion , the decision must be adverse to Addison . ” — W. E. B .</note>

       <l n="1">In ancient times , as story tells ,</l>

     <p>THE HISTORY OF VANBRUGH 'S HOUSE 1708</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">When Mother Cludd<span corresp="#note1_19" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>had rose from play ,</l>
       <l n="2">And call 'd to take the cards away ,</l>
       <l n="3">Van saw , but seem 'd not to regard ,</l>
       <l n="4">How Miss pick 'd every painted card ,</l>
       <l n="5">And , busy both with hand and eye ,</l>
       <l n="6">Soon rear 'd a house two stories high .</l>
       <l n="7">Van 's genius , without thought or lecture</l>
       <l n="8">Is hugely turn 'd to architecture :</l>
       <l n="9">He view 'd the edifice , and smiled ,</l>
       <l n="10">Vow 'd it was pretty for a child :</l>
       <l n="11">It was so perfect in its kind ,</l>
       <l n="12">He kept the model in his mind .</l>
       <l n="13">But , when he found the boys at play</l>
       <l n="14">And saw them dabbling in their clay ,</l>
       <l n="15">He stood behind a stall to lurk ,</l>
       <l n="16">And mark the progress of their work ;</l>
       <l n="17">With true delight observed them all</l>
       <l n="18">Raking up mud to build a wall .</l>
       <l n="19">The plan he much admired , and took</l>
       <l n="20">The model in his table-book :</l>
       <l n="21">Thought himself now exactly skill 'd ,</l>
       <l n="22">And so resolved a house to build :</l>
       <l n="23">A real house , with rooms and stairs ,</l>
       <l n="24">Five times at least as big as theirs ;</l>
       <l n="25">Taller than Miss 's by two yards ;</l>
       <l n="26">Not a sham thing of play or cards :</l>
       <l n="27">And so he did ; for , in a while ,</l>
       <l n="28">He built up such a monstrous pile ,</l>
       <l n="29">That no two chairmen could be found</l>
       <l n="30">Able to lift it from the ground .</l>
       <l n="31">Still at Whitehall it stands in view ,</l>
       <l n="32">Just in the place where first it grew ;</l>
       <l n="33">There all the little schoolboys run ,</l>
       <l n="34">Envying to see themselves outdone .</l>
       <l n="35">From such deep rudiments as these ,</l>
       <l n="36">Van is become , by due degrees ,</l>
       <l n="37">For building famed , and justly reckon 'd ,</l>
       <l n="38">At court ,<span corresp="#note2_14" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Vitruvius the Second :[ 3 ]</l>
       <l n="39">No wonder , since wise authors show ,</l>
       <l n="40">That best foundations must be low :</l>
       <l n="41">And now the duke has wisely ta'en him</l>
       <l n="42">To be his architect at Blenheim .</l>
       <l n="43">But raillery at once apart ,</l>
       <l n="44">If this rule holds in every art ;</l>
       <l n="45">Or if his grace were no more skill 'd in</l>
       <l n="46">The art of battering walls than building ,</l>

      <head>A GRUB-STREET ELEGY</head>
      <head>ON THE SUPPOSED DEATH OF PARTRIDGE THE ALMANACK MAKER .<span corresp="#note1_20" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>1708</head>
       <l n="1">Well ; ‘ tis as Bickerstaff has guest ,</l>
       <l n="2">Though we all took it for a jest :</l>
       <l n="3">Partridge is dead ; nay more , he dy 'd ,</l>
       <l n="4">Ere he could prove the good ‘ squire ly 'd .</l>
       <l n="5">Strange , an astrologer should die</l>
       <l n="6">Without one wonder in the sky ;</l>
       <l n="7">Not one of all his crony stars</l>
       <l n="8">To pay their duty at his hearse !</l>
       <l n="9">No meteor , no eclipse appear 'd !</l>
       <l n="10">No comet with a flaming beard !</l>
       <l n="11">The sun hath rose and gone to bed ,</l>
       <l n="12">Just as if Partridge were not dead ;</l>
       <l n="13">Nor hid himself behind the moon</l>
       <l n="14">To make a dreadful night at noon .</l>
       <l n="15">He at fit periods walks through Aries ,</l>
       <l n="16">Howe'er our earthly motion varies ;</l>
       <l n="17">And twice a-year he 'll cut th ’ Equator ,</l>
       <l n="18">As if there had been no such matter .</l>
       <l n="19">Some wits have wonder 'd what analogy</l>
       <l n="20">There is ‘ twixt cobbling<span corresp="#note2_15" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>and astrology ;</l>
       <l n="21">How Partridge made his optics rise</l>
       <l n="22">From a shoe-sole to reach the skies .</l>
       <l n="23">A list the cobbler 's temples ties ,</l>
       <l n="24">To keep the hair out of his eyes ;</l>
       <l n="25">From whence ‘ tis plain the diadem</l>
       <l n="26">That princes wear derives from them ;</l>
       <l n="27">And therefore crowns are now-a-days</l>
       <l n="28">Adorn 'd with golden stars and rays ;</l>
       <l n="29">Which plainly shows the near alliance</l>
       <l n="30">‘ Twixt cobbling and the planet 's science .</l>
       <l n="31">Besides , that slow-paced sign Böötes ,</l>
       <l n="32">As ‘ tis miscall 'd , we know not who ‘ tis ;</l>
       <l n="33">But Partridge ended all disputes ;</l>
       <l n="34">He knew his trade , and call 'd it boots .<span corresp="#note3_11" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span></l>
       <l n="35">The horned moon ,<span corresp="#note4_10" type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>which heretofore</l>
       <l n="36">Upon their shoes the Romans wore ,</l>
       <l n="37">Whose wideness kept their toes from corns ,</l>
       <l n="38">And whence we claim our shoeing-horns ,</l>
       <l n="39">Shows how the art of cobbling bears</l>
       <l n="40">A near resemblance to the spheres .</l>
       <l n="41">A scrap of parchment hung by geometry ,</l>
       <l n="42">( A great refiner in barometry ,)</l>
       <l n="43">Can , like the stars , foretell the weather ;</l>
       <l n="44">And what is parchment else but leather ?</l>
       <l n="45">Which an astrologer might use</l>
       <l n="46">Either for almanacks or shoes .</l>
       <l n="47">Thus Partridge , by his wit and parts ,</l>
       <l n="48">At once did practise both these arts :</l>
       <l n="49">And as the boding owl ( or rather</l>
       <l n="50">The bat , because her wings are leather )</l>
       <l n="51">Steals from her private cell by night ,</l>
       <l n="52">And flies about the candle-light ;</l>
       <l n="53">So learned Partridge could as well</l>
       <l n="54">Creep in the dark from leathern cell ,</l>
       <l n="55">And in his fancy fly as far</l>
       <l n="56">To peep upon a twinkling star .</l>
       <l n="57">Besides , he could confound the spheres ,</l>
       <l n="58">And set the planets by the ears ;</l>
       <l n="59">To show his skill , he Mars could join</l>
       <l n="60">To Venus in aspect malign ;</l>
       <l n="61">Then call in Mercury for aid ,</l>
       <l n="62">And cure the wounds that Venus made .</l>
       <l n="63">Great scholars have in Lucian read ,</l>
       <l n="64">When Philip King of Greece was dead</l>
       <l n="65">His soul and spirit did divide ,</l>
       <l n="66">And each part took a different side ;</l>
       <l n="67">One rose a star ; the other fell</l>
       <l n="68">Beneath , and mended shoes in Hell .<span corresp="#note5_7" type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span></l>
       <l n="69">Thus Partridge still shines in each art ,</l>
       <l n="70">The cobbling and star-gazing part ,</l>
       <l n="71">And is install 'd as good a star</l>
       <l n="72">As any of the Caesars are .</l>
       <l n="73">Triumphant star ! some pity show</l>
       <l n="74">On cobblers militant below ,</l>
       <l n="75">Whom roguish boys , in stormy nights ,</l>
       <l n="76">Torment by pissing out their lights ,</l>
       <l n="77">Or through a chink convey their smoke ,</l>
       <l n="78">Enclosed artificers to choke .</l>
       <l n="79">Thou , high exalted in thy sphere ,</l>
       <l n="80">May'st follow still thy calling there .</l>
       <l n="81">To thee the Bull will lend his hide ,</l>
       <l n="82">By Phoebus newly tann 'd and dry 'd ;</l>
       <l n="83">For thee they Argo 's hulk will tax ,</l>
       <l n="84">And scrape her pitchy sides for wax :</l>
       <l n="85">Then Ariadne kindly lends</l>
       <l n="86">Her braided hair to make thee ends ;</l>
       <l n="87">The points of Sagittarius ’ dart</l>
       <l n="88">Turns to an awl by heavenly art ;</l>
       <l n="89">And Vulcan , wheedled by his wife ,</l>
       <l n="90">Will forge for thee a paring-knife .</l>
       <l n="91">For want of room by Virgo 's side ,</l>
       <l n="92">She 'll strain a point , and sit<span corresp="#note6_3" type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>astride ,</l>
       <l n="93">To take thee kindly in between ;</l>
       <l n="94">And then the Signs will be Thirteen .</l>

       <l n="1">Whoever pleases to inquire</l>
       <l n="2">Why yonder steeple wants a spire ,</l>
       <l n="3">The grey old fellow , Poet Joe ,<span corresp="#note1_22" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></l>
       <l n="4">The philosophic cause will show .</l>
       <l n="5">Once on a time a western blast ,</l>
       <l n="6">At least twelve inches overcast ,</l>
       <l n="7">Reckoning roof , weathercock , and all ,</l>
       <l n="8">Which came with a prodigious fall ;</l>
       <l n="9">And , tumbling topsy-turvy round ,</l>
       <l n="10">Lit with its bottom on the ground :</l>
       <l n="11">For , by the laws of gravitation ,</l>
       <l n="12">It fell into its proper station .</l>
       <l n="13">This is the little strutting pile</l>
       <l n="14">You see just by the churchyard stile ;</l>
       <l n="15">The walls in tumbling gave a knock ,</l>
       <l n="16">And thus the steeple got a shock ;</l>
       <l n="17">From whence the neighbouring farmer calls</l>
       <l n="18">The steeple , Knock ; the vicar , Walls .<span corresp="#note2_18" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span></l>
       <l n="19">The vicar once a-week creeps in ,</l>
       <l n="20">Sits with his knees up to his chin ;</l>
       <l n="21">Here cons his notes , and takes a whet ,</l>
       <l n="22">Till the small ragged flock is met .</l>
       <l n="23">A traveller , who by did pass ,</l>
       <l n="24">Observed the roof behind the grass ;</l>
       <l n="25">On tiptoe stood , and rear 'd his snout ,</l>
       <l n="26">And saw the parson creeping out :</l>
       <l n="27">Was much surprised to see a crow</l>
       <l n="28">Venture to build his nest so low .</l>
       <l n="29">A schoolboy ran unto't , and thought</l>
       <l n="30">The crib was down , the blackbird caught .</l>
       <l n="31">A third , who lost his way by night ,</l>
       <l n="32">Was forced for safety to alight ,</l>
       <l n="33">And , stepping o'er the fabric roof ,</l>
       <l n="34">His horse had like to spoil his hoof .</l>
       <l n="35">Warburton<span corresp="#note3_13" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>took it in his noddle ,</l>
       <l n="36">This building was design 'd a model ;</l>
       <l n="37">Or of a pigeon-house or oven ,</l>
       <l n="38">To bake one loaf , or keep one dove in .</l>
       <l n="39">Then Mrs. Johnson<span corresp="#note4_12" type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>gave her verdict ,</l>
       <l n="40">And every one was pleased that heard it ;</l>
       <l n="41">All that you make this stir about</l>
       <l n="42">Is but a still which wants a spout .</l>
       <l n="43">The reverend Dr. Raymond<span corresp="#note5_9" type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>guess 'd</l>
       <l n="44">More probably than all the rest ;</l>
       <l n="45">He said , but that it wanted room ,</l>
       <l n="46">It might have been a pigmy 's tomb .</l>
       <l n="47">The doctor 's family came by ,</l>
       <l n="48">And little miss began to cry ,</l>
       <l n="49">Give me that house in my own hand !</l>
       <l n="50">Then madam bade the chariot stand ,</l>
       <l n="51">Call 'd to the clerk , in manner mild ,</l>
       <l n="52">Pray , reach that thing here to the child :</l>
       <l n="53">That thing , I mean , among the kale ;</l>
       <l n="54">And here 's to buy a pot of ale .</l>
       <l n="55">The clerk said to her in a heat ,</l>
       <l n="56">What ! sell my master 's country seat ,</l>
       <l n="57">Where he comes every week from town !</l>
       <l n="58">He would not sell it for a crown .</l>
       <l n="59">Poh ! fellow , keep not such a pother ;</l>

     <p>TO LORD HARLEY , ON HIS MARRIAGE<span corresp="#note1_25" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>OCTOBER 31 , 1713</p>

       <l n="1">Among the numbers who employ</l>
       <l n="2">Their tongues and pens to give you joy ,</l>
       <l n="3">Dear Harley ! generous youth , admit</l>
       <l n="4">What friendship dictates more than wit .</l>
       <l n="5">Forgive me , when I fondly thought</l>
       <l n="6">( By frequent observations taught )</l>
       <l n="7">A spirit so inform 'd as yours</l>
       <l n="8">Could never prosper in amours .</l>
       <l n="9">The God of Wit , and Light , and Arts ,</l>
       <l n="10">With all acquired and natural parts ,</l>
       <l n="11">Whose harp could savage beasts enchant ,</l>
       <l n="12">Was an unfortunate gallant .</l>
       <l n="13">Had Bacchus after Daphne reel 'd ,</l>
       <l n="14">The nymph had soon been brought to yield ;</l>
       <l n="15">Or , had embroider 'd Mars pursued ,</l>
       <l n="16">The nymph would ne'er have been a prude .</l>
       <l n="17">Ten thousand footsteps , full in view ,</l>
       <l n="18">Mark out the way where Daphne<span corresp="#note2_19" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>flew ;</l>
       <l n="19">For such is all the sex 's flight ,</l>
       <l n="20">They fly from learning , wit , and light ;</l>
       <l n="21">They fly , and none can overtake</l>
       <l n="22">But some gay coxcomb , or a rake .</l>
       <l n="23">How then , dear Harley , could I guess</l>
       <l n="24">That you should meet , in love , success ?</l>
       <l n="25">For , if those ancient tales be true ,</l>
       <l n="26">Phoebus was beautiful as you ;</l>
       <l n="27">Yet Daphne never slack 'd her pace ,</l>
       <l n="28">For wit and learning spoil 'd his face .</l>
       <l n="29">And since the same resemblance held</l>
       <l n="30">In gifts wherein you both excell 'd ,</l>
       <l n="31">I fancied every nymph would run</l>
       <l n="32">From you , as from Latona 's son .</l>
       <l n="33">Then where , said I , shall Harley find</l>
       <l n="34">A virgin of superior mind ,</l>
       <l n="35">With wit and virtue to discover ,</l>
       <l n="36">And pay the merit of her lover ?</l>
       <l n="37">This character shall Ca'endish claim ,</l>
       <l n="38">Born to retrieve her sex 's fame .</l>
       <l n="39">The chief among the glittering crowd ,</l>
       <l n="40">Of titles , birth , and fortune proud ,</l>
       <l n="41">( As fools are insolent and vain )</l>
       <l n="42">Madly aspired to wear her chain ;</l>
       <l n="43">But Pallas , guardian of the maid ,</l>
       <l n="44">Descending to her charge 's aid ,</l>
       <l n="45">Held out Medusa 's snaky locks ,</l>
       <l n="46">Which stupified them all to stocks .</l>
       <l n="47">The nymph with indignation view 'd</l>
       <l n="48">The dull , the noisy , and the lewd ;</l>
       <l n="49">For Pallas , with celestial light ,</l>
       <l n="50">Had purified her mortal sight ;</l>
       <l n="51">Show 'd her the virtues all combined ,</l>
       <l n="52">Fresh blooming , in young Harley 's mind .</l>
       <l n="53">Terrestrial nymphs , by formal arts ,</l>
       <l n="54">Display their various nets for hearts :</l>
       <l n="55">Their looks are all by method set ,</l>
       <l n="56">When to be prude , and when coquette ;</l>
       <l n="57">Yet , wanting skill and power to chuse ,</l>
       <l n="58">Their only pride is to refuse .</l>
       <l n="59">But , when a goddess would bestow</l>
       <l n="60">Her love on some bright youth below ,</l>
       <l n="61">Round all the earth she casts her eyes ;</l>
       <l n="62">And then , descending from the skies ,</l>
       <l n="63">Makes choice of him she fancies best ,</l>
       <l n="64">And bids the ravish 'd youth be bless 'd .</l>
       <l n="65">Thus the bright empress of the morn<span corresp="#note3_14" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span></l>
       <l n="66">Chose for her spouse a mortal born :</l>
       <l n="67">The goddess made advances first ;</l>
       <l n="68">Else what aspiring hero durst ?</l>
       <l n="69">Though , like a virgin of fifteen ,</l>
       <l n="70">She blushes when by mortals seen ;</l>
       <l n="71">Still blushes , and with speed retires ,</l>
       <l n="72">When Sol pursues her with his fires .</l>
       <l n="73">Diana thus , Heaven 's chastest queen</l>
       <l n="74">Struck with Endymion 's graceful mien</l>
       <l n="75">Down from her silver chariot came ,</l>
       <l n="76">And to the shepherd own 'd her flame .</l>
       <l n="77">Thus Ca'endish , as Aurora bright ,</l>
       <l n="78">And chaster than the Queen of Night</l>
       <l n="79">Descended from her sphere to find</l>
       <l n="80">A mortal of superior kind .</l>

       <l n="1">To you whose virtues , I must own</l>
       <l n="2">With shame , I have too lately known ;</l>
       <l n="3">To you , by art and nature taught</l>
       <l n="4">To be the man I long have sought ,</l>
       <l n="5">Had not ill Fate , perverse and blind ,</l>
       <l n="6">Placed you in life too far behind :</l>
       <l n="7">Or , what I should repine at more ,</l>
       <l n="8">Placed me in life too far before :</l>
       <l n="9">To you the Muse this verse bestows ,</l>
       <l n="10">Which might as well have been in prose ;</l>
       <l n="11">No thought , no fancy , no sublime ,</l>
       <l n="12">But simple topics told in rhyme .</l>
       <l n="13">Three gifts for conversation fit</l>
       <l n="14">Are humour , raillery , and wit :</l>
       <l n="15">The last , as boundless as the wind ,</l>
       <l n="16">Is well conceived , though not defined ;</l>
       <l n="17">For , sure by wit is only meant</l>
       <l n="18">Applying what we first invent .</l>
       <l n="19">What humour is , not all the tribe</l>
       <l n="20">Of logic-mongers can describe ;</l>
       <l n="21">Here only nature acts her part ,</l>
       <l n="22">Unhelp 'd by practice , books , or art :</l>
       <l n="23">For wit and humour differ quite ;</l>
       <l n="24">That gives surprise , and this delight ,</l>
       <l n="25">Humour is odd , grotesque , and wild ,</l>
       <l n="26">Only by affectation spoil 'd ;</l>
       <l n="27">‘ Tis never by invention got ,</l>
       <l n="28">Men have it when they know it not .</l>
       <l n="29">Our conversation to refine ,</l>
       <l n="30">True humour must with wit combine :</l>
       <l n="31">From both we learn to rally well ,</l>
       <l n="32">Wherein French writers most excel ;</l>
       <l n="33"><span corresp="#note2_21" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Voiture , in various lights , displays</l>
       <l n="34">That irony which turns to praise :</l>
       <l n="35">His genius first found out the rule</l>
       <l n="36">For an obliging ridicule :</l>
       <l n="37">He flatters with peculiar air</l>
       <l n="38">The brave , the witty , and the fair :</l>
       <l n="39">And fools would fancy he intends</l>
       <l n="40">A satire where he most commends .</l>
       <l n="41">But as a poor pretending beau ,</l>
       <l n="42">Because he fain would make a show ,</l>
       <l n="43">Nor can afford to buy gold lace ,</l>
       <l n="44">Takes up with copper in the place :</l>
       <l n="45">So the pert dunces of mankind ,</l>
       <l n="46">Whene'er they would be thought refined ,</l>
       <l n="47">Because the diff'rence lies abstruse</l>
       <l n="48">‘ Twixt raillery and gross abuse ,</l>
       <l n="49">To show their parts will scold and rail ,</l>
       <l n="50">Like porters o'er a pot of ale .</l>
       <l n="51">Such is that clan of boisterous bears ,</l>
       <l n="52">Always together by the ears ;</l>
       <l n="53">Shrewd fellows and arch wags , a tribe</l>
       <l n="54">That meet for nothing but to gibe ;</l>
       <l n="55">Who first run one another down ,</l>
       <l n="56">And then fall foul on all the town ;</l>
       <l n="57">Skill 'd in the horse-laugh and dry rub ,</l>
       <l n="58">And call 'd by excellence The Club .</l>
       <l n="59">I mean your butler , Dawson , Car ,</l>
       <l n="60">All special friends , and always jar .</l>
       <l n="61">The mettled and the vicious steed</l>
       <l n="62">Do not more differ in their breed ,</l>
       <l n="63">Nay , Voiture is as like Tom Leigh ,</l>
       <l n="64">As rudeness is to repartee .</l>
       <l n="65">If what you said I wish unspoke ,</l>
       <l n="66">‘ Twill not suffice it was a joke :</l>
       <l n="67">Reproach not , though in jest , a friend</l>
       <l n="68">For those defects he cannot mend ;</l>
       <l n="69">His lineage , calling , shape , or sense ,</l>
       <l n="70">If named with scorn , gives just offence .</l>
       <l n="71">What use in life to make men fret ,</l>
       <l n="72">Part in worse humour than they met ?</l>
       <l n="73">Thus all society is lost ,</l>
       <l n="74">Men laugh at one another 's cost :</l>
       <l n="75">And half the company is teazed</l>
       <l n="76">That came together to be pleased :</l>
       <l n="77">For all buffoons have most in view</l>
       <l n="78">To please themselves by vexing you .</l>
       <l n="79">When jests are carried on too far ,</l>
       <l n="80">And the loud laugh begins the war ,</l>
       <l n="81">You keep your countenance for shame ,</l>
       <l n="82">Yet still you think your friend to blame ;</l>
       <l n="83">For though men cry they love a jest ,</l>
       <l n="84">‘ Tis but when others stand the test ;</l>
       <l n="85">And ( would you have their meaning known )</l>
       <l n="86">They love a jest when ‘ tis their own .</l>
       <l n="87">You wonder now to see me write</l>
       <l n="88">So gravely where the subject 's light ;</l>
       <l n="89">Some part of what I here design</l>
       <l n="90">Regards a friend<span corresp="#note3_15" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>of yours and mine ;</l>
       <l n="91">Who full of humour , fire , and wit ,</l>
       <l n="92">Not always judges what is fit ,</l>
       <l n="93">But loves to take prodigious rounds ,</l>
       <l n="94">And sometimes walks beyond his bounds ,</l>
       <l n="95">You must , although the point be nice ,</l>
       <l n="96">Venture to give him some advice ;</l>
       <l n="97">Few hints from you will set him right ,</l>
       <l n="98">And teach him how to be polite .</l>
       <l n="99">Bid him like you , observe with care ,</l>
       <l n="100">Whom to be hard on , whom to spare ;</l>
       <l n="101">Nor indiscreetly to suppose</l>
       <l n="102">All subjects like Dan Jackson 's<span corresp="#note4_13" type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>nose .</l>
       <l n="103">To study the obliging jest ,</l>
       <l n="104">By reading those who teach it best ;</l>
       <l n="105">For prose I recommend Voiture 's ,</l>
       <l n="106">For verse ( I speak my judgment ) yours .</l>
       <l n="107">He 'll find the secret out from thence ,</l>
       <l n="108">To rhyme all day without offence ;</l>
       <l n="109">And I no more shall then accuse</l>
       <l n="110">The flirts of his ill-manner 'd Muse .</l>
       <l n="111">If he be guilty , you must mend him ;</l>
       <l n="112">If he be innocent , defend him .</l>

       <l n="52">And presently guessed the fancy was mine .</l>
       <l n="53">She can swear to the Parson whom oft she has seen</l>
       <l n="54">At night between Cavan Street and College Green .</l>
       <l n="55">Now you see why his verses so seldom are shown ,</l>
       <l n="56">The reason is plain , they are none of his own ;</l>
       <l n="57">And observe while you live that no man is shy</l>
       <l n="58">To discover the goods he came honestly by .</l>
       <l n="59">If I light on a thought , he will certainly steal it ,</l>
       <l n="60">And when he has got it , find ways to conceal it .</l>
       <l n="61">Of all the fine things he keeps in the dark ,</l>
       <l n="62">There 's scarce one in ten but what has my mark ;</l>
       <l n="63">And let them be seen by the world if he dare ,</l>
       <l n="64">I 'll make it appear they are all stolen ware .</l>
       <l n="65">But as for the poem he writ on your sash ,</l>
       <l n="66">I think I have now got him under my lash ;</l>
       <l n="67">My sister transcribed it last night to his sorrow ,</l>
       <l n="68">And the public shall see't , if I live till to-morrow .</l>
       <l n="69">Thro ’ the zodiac around , it shall quickly be spread</l>
       <l n="70">In all parts of the globe where your language is read .</l>
       <l n="71">He knows very well , I ne'er gave a refusal ,</l>
       <l n="72">When he ask 'd for my aid in the forms that are usual :</l>
       <l n="73">But the secret is this ; I did lately intend</l>
       <l n="74">To write a few verses on you as my friend :</l>
       <l n="75">I studied a fortnight , before I could find ,</l>
       <l n="76">As I rode in my chariot , a thought to my mind ,</l>
       <l n="77">And resolved the next winter ( for that is my time ,</l>
       <l n="78">When the days are at shortest ) to get it in rhyme ;</l>
       <l n="79">Till then it was lock 'd in my box at Parnassus ;</l>
       <l n="80">When that subtle companion , in hopes to surpass us ,</l>
       <l n="81">Conveys out my paper of hints by a trick</l>
       <l n="82">( For I think in my conscience he deals with old Nick ,)</l>
       <l n="83">And from my own stock provided with topics ,</l>
       <l n="84">He gets to a window beyond both the tropics ,</l>
       <l n="85">There out of my sight , just against the north zone ,</l>
       <l n="86">Writes down my conceits , and then calls them his own ;</l>
       <l n="87">And you , like a cully , the bubble can swallow :</l>
       <l n="88">Now who but Delany that writes like Apollo ?</l>
       <l n="89">High treason by statute ! yet here you object ,</l>
       <l n="90">He only stole hints , but the verse is correct ;</l>
       <l n="91">Though the thought be Apollo 's , ‘ tis finely express 'd ;</l>
       <l n="92">So a thief steals my horse , and has him well dress 'd .</l>
       <l n="93">Now whereas the said criminal seems past repentance ,</l>
       <l n="94">We Phoebus think fit to proceed to his sentence .</l>
       <l n="95">Since Delany hath dared , like Prometheus his sire ,</l>
       <l n="96">To climb to our region , and thence to steal fire ;</l>
       <l n="97">We order a vulture in shape of the Spleen ,</l>
       <l n="98">To prey on his liver , but not to be seen .</l>
       <l n="99">And we order our subjects of every degree</l>
       <l n="100">To believe all his verses were written by me :</l>
       <l n="101">And under the pain of our highest displeasure ,</l>
       <l n="102">To call nothing his but the rhyme and the measure .</l>
       <l n="103">And , lastly , for Stella , just out of her prime ,</l>
       <l n="104">I 'm too much revenged already by Time ,</l>
       <l n="105">In return of her scorn , I sent her diseases ,</l>
       <l n="106">But will now be her friend whenever she pleases .</l>
       <l n="107">And the gifts I bestow 'd her will find her a lover</l>
       <l n="108">Though she lives till she 's grey as a badger all over .</l>

       <l n="2">BY DR. DELANY</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>OCCASIONED BY “ APOLLO TO THE DEAN ” 1720</head>
       <l n="1">Parnassus , February the twenty-seventh .</l>
       <l n="2">The poets assembled here on the eleventh ,</l>
       <l n="3">Convened by Apollo , who gave them to know</l>
       <l n="4">He 'd have a vicegerent in his empire below ;</l>
       <l n="5">But declared that no bard should this honour inherit ,</l>
       <l n="6">Till the rest had agreed he surpass 'd them in merit :</l>
       <l n="7">Now this , you 'll allow , was a difficult case ,</l>
       <l n="8">For each bard believed he 'd a right to the place ;</l>
       <l n="9">So , finding the assembly grow warm in debate ,</l>
       <l n="10">He put them in mind of his Phaethon 's fate :</l>
       <l n="11">‘ Twas urged to no purpose ; disputes higher rose ,</l>
       <l n="12">Scarce Phoebus himself could their quarrels compose ;</l>
       <l n="13">Till at length he determined that every bard</l>
       <l n="14">Should ( each in his turn ) be patiently heard .</l>
       <l n="15">First , one who believed he excell 'd in translation ,<span corresp="#note1_34" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></l>
       <l n="16">Founds his claim on the doctrine of man 's transmigration :</l>
       <l n="17">“ Since the soul of great Milton was given to me ,</l>
       <l n="18">I hope the convention will quickly agree . ” —</l>
       <l n="19">“ Agree ; ” quoth Apollo : “ from whence is this fool ?</l>
       <l n="20">Is he just come from reading Pythagoras at school ?</l>
       <l n="21">Begone , sir , you 've got your subscriptions in time ,</l>
       <l n="22">And given in return neither reason nor rhyme . ”</l>
       <l n="23">To the next says the God , “ Though now I wo n't chuse you ,</l>
       <l n="24">I 'll tell you the reason for which I refuse you :</l>
       <l n="25">Love 's Goddess has oft to her parents complain 'd ,</l>
       <l n="26">Of my favouring a bard who her empire disdain 'd ;</l>
       <l n="27">That at my instigation , a poem you writ ,</l>
       <l n="28">Which to beauty and youth preferr 'd judgment and wit ;</l>
       <l n="29">That , to make you a Laureate , I gave the first voice ,</l>
       <l n="30">Inspiring the Britons t'approve of my choice .</l>
       <l n="31">Jove sent her to me , her power to try ;</l>
       <l n="32">The Goddess of Beauty what God can deny ?</l>
       <l n="33">She forbids your preferment ; I grant her desire .</l>
       <l n="34">Appease the fair Goddess : you then may rise higher . ”</l>
       <l n="35">The next<span corresp="#note2_24" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>that appear 'd had good hopes of succeeding ,</l>
       <l n="36">For he merited much for his wit and his breeding .</l>
       <l n="37">‘ Twas wise in the Britons no favour to show him ,</l>
       <l n="38">He else might expect they should pay what they owe him .</l>
       <l n="39">And therefore they prudently chose to discard</l>
       <l n="40">The Patriot , whose merits they would not reward :</l>
       <l n="41">The God , with a smile , bade his favourite advance ,</l>
       <l n="42">“ You were sent by Astraea her envoy to France :</l>
       <l n="43">You bend your ambition to rise in the state ;</l>
       <l n="44">I refuse you , because you could stoop to be great . ”</l>
       <l n="45">Then a bard who had been a successful translator ,<span corresp="#note3_18" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span></l>
       <l n="46">“ The convention allows me a versificator . ”</l>
       <l n="47">Says Apollo , “ You mention the least of your merit ;</l>
       <l n="48">By your works , it appears you have much of my spirit .</l>
       <l n="49">I esteem you so well , that , to tell you the truth ,</l>
       <l n="50">The greatest objection against you 's your youth ;</l>
       <l n="51">Then be not concern 'd you are now laid aside ;</l>
       <l n="52">If you live you shall certainly one day preside . ”</l>
       <l n="53">Another , low bending , Apollo thus greets ,</l>
       <l n="54">“ ‘ Twas I taught your subjects to walk through the streets . "[ 4 ]</l>
       <l n="55">You taught them to walk ! why , they knew it before ;</l>
       <l n="56">But give me the bard that can teach them to soar .</l>
       <l n="57">Whenever he claims , ‘ tis his right , I 'll confess ,</l>
       <l n="58">Who lately attempted my style with success ;</l>
       <l n="59">Who writes like Apollo has most of his spirit ,</l>
       <l n="60">And therefore ‘ tis just I distinguish his merit :</l>
       <l n="61">Who makes it appear , by all he has writ ,</l>
       <l n="62">His judgment alone can set bounds to his wit ;</l>
       <l n="63">Like Virgil correct , with his own native ease ,</l>
       <l n="64">But excels even Virgil in elegant praise :</l>
       <l n="65">Who admires the ancients , and knows ‘ tis their due</l>
       <l n="66">Yet writes in a manner entirely new ;</l>
       <l n="67">Though none with more ease their depths can explore ,</l>
       <l n="68">Yet whatever he wants he takes from my store ;</l>
       <l n="69">Though I 'm fond of his virtues , his pride I can see ,</l>
       <l n="70">In scorning to borrow from any but me :</l>
       <l n="71">It is owing to this , that , like Cynthia ,<span corresp="#note5_10" type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>his lays</l>
       <l n="72">Enlighten the world by reflecting my rays .</l>
       <l n="73">This said , the whole audience soon found out his drift :</l>
       <l n="74">The convention was summon 'd in favour of SWIFT .</l>

       <l n="101">But now , though scarce a twelvemonth married ,</l>
       <l n="102">Poor Lady Jane has thrice miscarried :</l>
       <l n="103">The cause , alas ! is quickly guest ;</l>

       <l n="3">Grown fat with corn and sitting still ,</l>
       <l n="4">Can scarce get o'er the barn-door sill ;</l>
       <l n="5">And hardly waddles forth to cool</l>

       <l n="7">Nor loudly cackles at the door ;</l>
       <l n="8">For cackling shows the goose is poor .</l>
       <l n="9">But , when she must be turn 'd to graze ,</l>
       <l n="10">And round the barren common strays ,</l>
       <l n="11">Hard exercise , and harder fare ,</l>

       <l n="13">Her body light , she tries her wings ,</l>
       <l n="14">And scorns the ground , and upward springs ;</l>
       <l n="15">While all the parish , as she flies ,</l>
       <l n="16">Hear sounds harmonious from the skies .</l>
       <l n="17">Such is the poet fresh in pay ,</l>
       <l n="18">The third night 's profits of his play ;</l>

       <l n="20">Among his brethren of the quill :</l>

      <head>The enclosed prologue is formed upon the story of the secretary 's not allowing you to act , unless you would pay him £ 300 per annum ; upon which you got a license from the Lord Mayor to act as strollers . The prologue supposes , that upon your being forbidden to act , a company of country strollers came and hired the playhouse , and your clothes , etc . to act in .</head>
       <l n="1">Our set of strollers , wandering up and down ,</l>

       <l n="4">Went to one Griffith , formerly a player :</l>
       <l n="5">Him we persuaded , with a moderate bribe ,</l>
       <l n="6">To speak to Elrington<span corresp="#note1_40" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>and all the tribe ,</l>
       <l n="7">To let our company supply their places ,</l>
       <l n="8">And hire us out their scenes , and clothes , and faces .</l>
       <l n="9">Is not the truth the truth ? Look full on me ;</l>
       <l n="10">I am not Elrington , nor Griffith he .</l>

       <l n="16">Rather than starve , a better man would stroll .</l>

       <l n="35">In every town we wait on Mr. Mayor ,</l>

       <l n="40">Gallants , by Tuesday next we must be gone .</l>
       <l n="41">I told him in the smoothest way I could ,</l>
       <l n="42">All this , and more , yet it would do no good .</l>
       <l n="43">But Elrington , tears falling from his cheeks ,</l>

       <l n="47">Owns all your favours , here intends to stay ,</l>
       <l n="48">And , as a stroller , act in every play :</l>
       <l n="49">And the whole crew this resolution takes ,</l>
       <l n="50">To live and die all strollers , for your sakes ;</l>
       <l n="51">Not frighted with an ignominious name ,</l>
       <l n="52">For your displeasure is their only shame .</l>
       <l n="53">A pox on Elrington 's majestic tone !</l>
       <l n="54">Now to a word of business in our own .</l>
       <l n="55">Gallants , next Thursday night will be our last :</l>
       <l n="56">Then without fail we pack up for Belfast .</l>
       <l n="57">Lose not your time , nor our diversion miss ,</l>
       <l n="58">The next we act shall be as good as this .</l>

       <l n="16">Have been all kept from starving by a benefit-night .</l>
       <l n="17">Thus , for Hoppy 's bright merits , at length we have found</l>
       <l n="18">That he must have of us ninety-nine and one pound ,</l>
       <l n="19">Paid to him clear money once every year :</l>
       <l n="20">And however some think it a little too dear ,</l>
       <l n="21">Yet , for reasons of state , this sum we 'll allow ,</l>
       <l n="22">Though we pay the good man with the sweat of our brow .</l>
       <l n="23">First , because by the King to us he was sent ,</l>
       <l n="24">To guide the whole session of this parliament .</l>
       <l n="25">To preside in our councils , both public and private ,</l>
       <l n="26">And so learn , by the by , what both houses do drive at .</l>
       <l n="27">When bold B —— roars , and meek M —— raves ,</l>
       <l n="28">When Ash prates by wholesale , or Be —— h by halves ,</l>
       <l n="29">When Whigs become Whims , or join with the Tories ;</l>
       <l n="30">And to himself constant when a member no more is ,</l>
       <l n="31">But changes his sides , and votes and unvotes ;</l>
       <l n="32">As S —— t is dull , and with S —— d , who dotes ;</l>
       <l n="33">Then up must get Hoppy , and with voice very low ,</l>
       <l n="34">And with eloquent bow , the house he must show ,</l>
       <l n="35">That that worthy member who spoke last must give</l>
       <l n="36">The freedom to him , humbly most , to conceive ,</l>
       <l n="37">That his sentiment on this affair is n't right ;</l>
       <l n="38">That he mightily wonders which way he came by't :</l>
       <l n="39">That , for his part , God knows , he does such things disown ;</l>
       <l n="40">And so , having convinced him , he most humbly sits down .</l>
       <l n="41">For these , and more reasons , which perhaps you may hear ,</l>
       <l n="42">Pounds hundred this night , and one hundred this year ,</l>
       <l n="43">And so on we are forced , though we sweat out our blood ,</l>
       <l n="44">To make these walls pay for poor Hoppy 's good ;</l>
       <l n="45">To supply with rare diet his pot and his spit ;</l>
       <l n="46">And with richest Margoux to wash down a tit-bit .</l>
       <l n="47">To wash oft his fine linen , so clean and so neat ,</l>
       <l n="48">And to buy him much linen , to fence against sweat :</l>
       <l n="49">All which he deserves ; for although all the day</l>
       <l n="50">He ofttimes is heavy , yet all night he 's gay ;</l>
       <l n="51">And if he rise early to watch for the state ,</l>
       <l n="52">To keep up his spirits he 'll sit up as late .</l>
       <l n="53">Thus , for these and more reasons , as before I did say</l>
       <l n="54">Hop has got all the money for our acting this play ,</l>
       <l n="55">Which makes us poor actors look je ne sçai quoy .</l>

     <note xml:id="note1_41" place="bottom" n="1">This piece , which relates , like the former , to the avaricious demands which the Irish Secretary of State made upon the company of players , is said , in the collection called “ Gulliveriana , ” to have been composed by Swift , and delivered by him at Gaulstown House . But it is more likely to have been written by some other among the joyous guests of the Lord Chief Baron , since it does not exhibit Swift 's accuracy of numbers .— Scott . Perhaps so , but the note to this piece in “ Gulliveriana ” is “ Spoken by the Captain , one evening , at the end of a private farce , acted by gentlemen , for their own diversion at Gallstown ” ; the “ Captain ” being Swift , as the leader of the “ joyous guests . ” This is very different from “ composed . ” — W.

       <l n="3">Great cry , and little wool — is now become</l>
       <l n="4">The plague and proverb of the weaver 's loom ;</l>
       <l n="5">No wool to work on , neither weft nor warp ;</l>
       <l n="6">Their pockets empty , and their stomachs sharp .</l>
       <l n="7">Provoked , in loud complaints to you they cry ;</l>
       <l n="8">Ladies , relieve the weavers ; or they die !</l>
       <l n="9">Forsake your silks for stuff 's ; nor think it strange</l>
       <l n="10">To shift your clothes , since you delight in change .</l>
       <l n="11">One thing with freedom I 'll presume to tell —</l>
       <l n="12">The men will like you every bit as well .</l>
       <l n="13">See I am dress 'd from top to toe in stuff ,</l>
       <l n="14">And , by my troth , I think I 'm fine enough ;</l>
       <l n="15">My wife admires me more , and swears she never ,</l>
       <l n="16">In any dress , beheld me look so clever .</l>
       <l n="17">And if a man be better in such ware ,</l>
       <l n="18">What great advantage must it give the fair !</l>
       <l n="19">Our wool from lambs of innocence proceeds ;</l>
       <l n="20">Silks come from maggots , calicoes from weeds ;</l>
       <l n="21">Hence ‘ tis by sad experience that we find</l>
       <l n="22">Ladies in silks to vapours much inclined —</l>
       <l n="23">And what are they but maggots in the mind ?</l>
       <l n="24">For which I think it reason to conclude ,</l>
       <l n="25">That clothes may change our temper like our food .</l>
       <l n="26">Chintzes are gawdy , and engage our eyes</l>
       <l n="27">Too much about the party-colour 'd dyes ;</l>
       <l n="28">Although the lustre is from you begun ,</l>
       <l n="29">We see the rainbow , and neglect the sun .</l>
       <l n="30">How sweet and innocent 's the country maid ,</l>
       <l n="31">With small expense in native wool array 'd ;</l>
       <l n="32">Who copies from the fields her homely green ,</l>
       <l n="33">While by her shepherd with delight she 's seen !</l>
       <l n="34">Should our fair ladies dress like her , in wool</l>
       <l n="35">How much more lovely , and how beautiful ,</l>
       <l n="36">Without their Indian drapery , they 'd prove !</l>
       <l n="37">While wool would help to warm us into love !</l>
       <l n="38">Then , like the famous Argonauts of Greece ,</l>
       <l n="39">We 'll all contend to gain the Golden Fleece !</l>

       <l n="1">Who dares affirm this is no pious age ,</l>
       <l n="2">When charity begins to tread the stage ?</l>
       <l n="3">When actors , who at best are hardly savers ,</l>
       <l n="4">Will give a night of benefit to weavers ?</l>
       <l n="5">Stay — let me see , how finely will it sound !</l>

       <l n="7">Peers , clergy , gentry , all are benefactors ;</l>
       <l n="8">And then comes in the item of the actors .</l>
       <l n="9">Item , The actors freely give a day —</l>
       <l n="10">The poet had no more who made the play .</l>
       <l n="11">But whence this wondrous charity in players ?</l>
       <l n="12">They learn it not at sermons , or at prayers :</l>
       <l n="13">Under the rose , since here are none but friends ,</l>
       <l n="14">( To own the truth ) we have some private ends .</l>
       <l n="15">Since waiting-women , like exacting jades ,</l>
       <l n="16">Hold up the prices of their old brocades ;</l>
       <l n="17">We 'll dress in manufactures made at home ;</l>
       <l n="18">Equip our kings and generals at the Comb .<span corresp="#note2_31" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span></l>
       <l n="19">We 'll rig from Meath Street Egypt 's haughty queen</l>
       <l n="20">And Antony shall court her in ratteen .</l>
       <l n="21">In blue shalloon shall Hannibal be clad ,</l>
       <l n="22">And Scipio trail an Irish purple plaid ,</l>
       <l n="23">In drugget drest , of thirteen pence a-yard ,</l>
       <l n="24">See Philip 's son amidst his Persian guard ;</l>
       <l n="25">And proud Roxana , fired with jealous rage ,</l>
       <l n="26">With fifty yards of crape shall sweep the stage .</l>
       <l n="27">In short , our kings and princesses within</l>
       <l n="28">Are all resolved this project to begin ;</l>
       <l n="29">And you , our subjects , when you here resort ,</l>
       <l n="30">Must imitate the fashion of the court .</l>
       <l n="31">O ! could I see this audience clad in stuff ,</l>
       <l n="32">Though money 's scarce , we should have trade enough :</l>
       <l n="33">But chintz , brocades , and lace , take all away ,</l>
       <l n="34">And scarce a crown is left to see the play .</l>
       <l n="35">Perhaps you wonder whence this friendship springs</l>
       <l n="36">Between the weavers and us playhouse kings ;</l>
       <l n="37">But wit and weaving had the same beginning ;</l>
       <l n="38">Pallas<span corresp="#note3_23" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>first taught us poetry and spinning :</l>
       <l n="39">And , next , observe how this alliance fits ,</l>
       <l n="40">For weavers now are just as poor as wits :</l>
       <l n="41">Their brother quillmen , workers for the stage ,</l>
       <l n="42">For sorry stuff can get a crown a page ;</l>
       <l n="43">But weavers will be kinder to the players ,</l>
       <l n="44">And sell for twenty pence a yard of theirs .</l>
       <l n="45">And to your knowledge , there is often less in</l>
       <l n="46">The poet 's wit , than in the player 's dressing .</l>

       <l n="6">Far above mortal dress the sisters shine ,</l>
       <l n="7">Pride in their Indian Robes , and must be fine .</l>
       <l n="8">And shall two bards in concert rhyme , and huff</l>
       <l n="9">And fret these Muses with their playhouse stuff ?</l>
       <l n="10">The player in mimic piety may storm ,</l>
       <l n="11">Deplore the Comb , and bid her heroes arm :</l>

       <l n="16">The cotton plant , whom satire cannot blast ,</l>
       <l n="17">Shall bloom the favourite of these realms , and last ;</l>
       <l n="18">Like yours , ye fair , her fame from censure grows ,</l>
       <l n="19">Prevails in charms , and glares above her foes :</l>
       <l n="20">Your injured plant shall meet a loud defence ,</l>
       <l n="21">And be the emblem of your innocence .</l>
       <l n="22">Some bard , perhaps , whose landlord was a weaver ,</l>
       <l n="23">Penn 'd the low prologue to return a favour :</l>
       <l n="24">Some neighbour wit , that would be in the vogue ,</l>
       <l n="25">Work 'd with his friend , and wove the epilogue .</l>
       <l n="26">Who weaves the chaplet , or provides the bays ,</l>
       <l n="27">For such wool-gathering sonnetteers as these ?</l>
       <l n="28">Hence , then , ye homespun witlings , that persuade</l>
       <l n="29">Miss Chloe to the fashion of her maid .</l>
       <l n="30">Shall the wide hoop , that standard of the town ,</l>
       <l n="31">Thus act subservient to a poplin gown ?</l>
       <l n="32">Who 'd smell of wool all over ? ‘ Tis enough</l>

       <l n="34">Lord ! to be wrapt in flannel just in May ,</l>
       <l n="35">When the fields dress 'd in flowers appear so gay !</l>
       <l n="36">And shall not miss be flower 'd as well as they ?</l>
       <l n="37">In what weak colours would the plaid appear ,</l>
       <l n="38">Work 'd to a quilt , or studded in a chair !</l>
       <l n="39">The skin , that vies with silk , would fret with stuff ;</l>
       <l n="40">Or who could bear in bed a thing so rough ?</l>
       <l n="41">Ye knowing fair , how eminent that bed ,</l>
       <l n="42">Where the chintz diamonds with the silken thread ,</l>
       <l n="43">Where rustling curtains call the curious eye ,</l>
       <l n="44">And boast the streaks and paintings of the sky !</l>
       <l n="45">Of flocks they 'd have your milky ticking full :</l>
       <l n="46">And all this for the benefit of wool !</l>
       <l n="47">“ But where , ” say they , “ shall we bestow these weavers ,</l>
       <l n="48">That spread our streets , and are such piteous cravers ? ”</l>
       <l n="49">The silk-worms ( brittle beings ! ) prone to fate ,</l>

       <l n="44">And Lady Betty soundly chides them .</l>
       <l n="45">Now water brought , and dinner done ;</l>
       <l n="46">With “ Church and King ” the ladies gone .</l>
       <l n="47">Not reckoning half an hour we pass</l>
       <l n="48">In talking o'er a moderate glass .</l>
       <l n="49">Dan , growing drowsy , like a thief</l>
       <l n="50">Steals off to doze away his beef ;</l>

       <l n="77">For brevity I have retrench 'd</l>
       <l n="78">How in the lake the Dean was drench 'd :</l>
       <l n="79">It would be an exploit to brag on ,</l>
       <l n="80">How valiant George rode o'er the Dragon ;</l>

       <l n="82">And saved his oar , but lost his hat :</l>

       <l n="86">How fortune fails him when he sets ;</l>

       <l n="88">The ladies , and lampoon their sex :</l>
       <l n="89">I might have told how oft Dean Perceval</l>

       <l n="121">Why should I tell of ponds and drains ,</l>
       <l n="122">What carps we met with for our pains ;</l>
       <l n="123">Of sparrows tamed , and nuts innumerable</l>
       <l n="124">To choke the girls , and to consume a rabble ?</l>

       <l n="132">The bed in which those tyrants lie ;</l>

       <l n="1">WOULD you that Delville I describe ?</l>
       <l n="2">Believe me , Sir , I will not gibe :</l>
       <l n="3">For who would be satirical</l>
       <l n="4">Upon a thing so very small ?</l>
       <l n="5">You scarce upon the borders enter ,</l>
       <l n="6">Before you 're at the very centre .</l>
       <l n="7">A single crow can make it night ,</l>
       <l n="8">When o'er your farm she takes her flight :</l>
       <l n="9">Yet , in this narrow compass , we</l>
       <l n="10">Observe a vast variety ;</l>
       <l n="11">Both walks , walls , meadows , and parterres ,</l>
       <l n="12">Windows and doors , and rooms and stairs ,</l>
       <l n="13">And hills and dales , and woods and fields ,</l>
       <l n="14">And hay , and grass , and corn , it yields :</l>
       <l n="15">All to your haggard brought so cheap in ,</l>
       <l n="16">Without the mowing or the reaping :</l>
       <l n="17">A razor , though to say't I 'm loth ,</l>
       <l n="18">Would shave you and your meadows both .</l>
       <l n="19">Though small 's the farm , yet here 's a house</l>
       <l n="20">Full large to entertain a mouse ;</l>
       <l n="21">But where a rat is dreaded more</l>
       <l n="22">Than savage Caledonian boar ;</l>
       <l n="23">For , if it 's enter 'd by a rat ,</l>
       <l n="24">There is no room to bring a cat .</l>
       <l n="25">A little rivulet seems to steal</l>
       <l n="26">Down through a thing you call a vale ,</l>
       <l n="27">Like tears adown a wrinkled cheek ,</l>
       <l n="28">Like rain along a blade of leek :</l>
       <l n="29">And this you call your sweet meander ,</l>
       <l n="30">Which might be suck 'd up by a gander ,</l>
       <l n="31">Could he but force his nether bill</l>
       <l n="32">To scoop the channel of the rill .</l>
       <l n="33">For sure you 'd make a mighty clutter ,</l>
       <l n="34">Were it as big as city gutter .</l>
       <l n="35">Next come I to your kitchen garden ,</l>
       <l n="36">Where one poor mouse would fare but hard in ;</l>
       <l n="37">And round this garden is a walk</l>
       <l n="38">No longer than a tailor 's chalk ;</l>
       <l n="39">Thus I compare what space is in it ,</l>
       <l n="40">A snail creeps round it in a minute .</l>
       <l n="41">One lettuce makes a shift to squeeze</l>
       <l n="42">Up through a tuft you call your trees :</l>
       <l n="43">And , once a year , a single rose</l>
       <l n="44">Peeps from the bud , but never blows ;</l>
       <l n="45">In vain then you expect its bloom !</l>
       <l n="46">It cannot blow for want of room .</l>
       <l n="47">In short , in all your boasted seat ,</l>
       <l n="48">There 's nothing but yourself that 's GREAT .</l>

      <head>THE ANSWER</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">The wise pretend to make it clear ,</l>
       <l n="2">‘ Tis no great loss to lose an ear .</l>
       <l n="3">Why are we then so fond of two ,</l>
       <l n="4">When by experience one would do ?</l>
       <l n="5">‘ Tis true , say they , cut off the head ,</l>
       <l n="6">And there 's an end ; the man is dead ;</l>
       <l n="7">Because , among all human race ,</l>
       <l n="8">None e'er was known to have a brace :</l>
       <l n="9">But confidently they maintain ,</l>
       <l n="10">That where we find the members twain ,</l>
       <l n="11">The loss of one is no such trouble ,</l>
       <l n="12">Since t'other will in strength be double .</l>
       <l n="13">The limb surviving , you may swear ,</l>
       <l n="14">Becomes his brother 's lawful heir :</l>
       <l n="15">Thus , for a trial , let me beg of</l>
       <l n="16">Your reverence but to cut one leg off ,</l>
       <l n="17">And you shall find , by this device ,</l>
       <l n="18">The other will be stronger twice ;</l>
       <l n="19">For every day you shall be gaining</l>
       <l n="20">New vigour to the leg remaining .</l>
       <l n="21">So , when an eye has lost its brother ,</l>
       <l n="22">You see the better with the other ,</l>
       <l n="23">Cut off your hand , and you may do</l>
       <l n="24">With t'other hand the work of two :</l>
       <l n="25">Because the soul her power contracts ,</l>
       <l n="26">And on the brother limb reacts .</l>
       <l n="27">But yet the point is not so clear in</l>
       <l n="28">Another case , the sense of hearing :</l>
       <l n="29">For , though the place of either ear</l>
       <l n="30">Be distant , as one head can bear ,</l>
       <l n="31">Yet Galen most acutely shows you ,</l>
       <l n="32">( Consult his book de partium usu )</l>
       <l n="33">That from each ear , as he observes ,</l>
       <l n="34">There creep two auditory nerves ,</l>
       <l n="35">Not to be seen without a glass ,</l>
       <l n="36">Which near the os petrosum pass ;</l>
       <l n="37">Thence to the neck ; and moving thorough there ,</l>
       <l n="38">One goes to this , and one to t'other ear ;</l>
       <l n="39">Which made my grandam always stuff her ears</l>
       <l n="40">Both right and left , as fellow-sufferers .</l>
       <l n="41">You see my learning ; but , to shorten it ,</l>
       <l n="42">When my left ear was deaf a fortnight ,</l>
       <l n="43">To t'other ear I felt it coming on :</l>
       <l n="44">And thus I solve this hard phenomenon .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="45">‘ Tis true , a glass will bring supplies</l>

     <p>Richmond Lodge is a house with a small park belonging to the crown . It was usually granted by the crown for a lease of years . The Duke of Ormond was the last who had it . After his exile , it was given to the Prince of Wales by the king . The prince and princess usually passed their summer there . It is within a mile of Richmond .</p>
     <p>“ Marble Hill is a house built by Mrs. Howard , then of the bedchamber , now Countess of Suffolk , and groom of the stole to the queen . It is on the Middlesex side , near Twickenham , where Pope lives , and about two miles from Richmond Lodge . Pope was the contriver of the gardens , Lord Herbert the architect , the Dean of St. Patrick 's chief butler , and keeper of the ice-house .

       <l n="10">Like a beau in the box , he bow 'd low on each side !</l>
       <l n="11">And when his last speech the loud hawkers did cry ,</l>

       <l n="78">And to each other give the sign . ”</l>
       <l n="79">Through every game pursues her tale ,</l>
       <l n="80">Like hunters o'er their evening ale .</l>
       <l n="81">Now to another scene give place :</l>
       <l n="82">Enter the folks with silks and lace :</l>
       <l n="83">Fresh matter for a world of chat ,</l>
       <l n="84">Right Indian this , right Mechlin that :</l>
       <l n="85">“ Observe this pattern — there 's a stuff ;</l>

       <l n="91">This business of importance o'er ,</l>
       <l n="92">And madam almost dress 'd by four ;</l>
       <l n="93">The footman , in his usual phrase ,</l>
       <l n="94">Comes up with , “ Madam , dinner stays . ”</l>
       <l n="95">She answers , in her usual style ,</l>
       <l n="96">“ The cook must keep it back a while ;</l>
       <l n="97">I never can have time to dress ,</l>
       <l n="98">No woman breathing takes up less ;</l>
       <l n="99">I 'm hurried so , it makes me sick ;</l>
       <l n="100">I wish the dinner at Old Nick . ”</l>
       <l n="101">At table now she acts her part ,</l>
       <l n="102">Has all the dinner cant by heart :</l>
       <l n="103">“ I thought we were to dine alone ,</l>

       <l n="105">This company would come to-day —</l>
       <l n="106">But really ‘ tis my spouse 's way !</l>
       <l n="107">He 's so unkind , he never sends</l>
       <l n="108">To tell when he invites his friends :</l>
       <l n="109">I wish ye may but have enough ! ”</l>
       <l n="110">And while with all this paltry stuff</l>
       <l n="111">She sits tormenting every guest ,</l>
       <l n="112">Nor gives her tongue one moment 's rest ,</l>
       <l n="113">In phrases batter 'd , stale , and trite ,</l>
       <l n="114">Which modern ladies call polite ;</l>
       <l n="115">You see the booby husband sit</l>
       <l n="116">In admiration at her wit !</l>
       <l n="117">But let me now a while survey</l>
       <l n="118">Our madam o'er her evening tea ;</l>
       <l n="119">Surrounded with her noisy clans</l>
       <l n="120">Of prudes , coquettes , and harridans ,</l>
       <l n="121">When , frighted at the clamorous crew ,</l>
       <l n="122">Away the God of Silence flew ,</l>
       <l n="123">And fair Discretion left the place ,</l>
       <l n="124">And modesty with blushing face ;</l>
       <l n="125">Now enters overweening Pride ,</l>
       <l n="126">And Scandal , ever gaping wide ,</l>
       <l n="127">Hypocrisy with frown severe ,</l>
       <l n="128">Scurrility with gibing air ;</l>
       <l n="129">Rude laughter seeming like to burst ,</l>
       <l n="130">And Malice always judging worst ;</l>
       <l n="131">And Vanity with pocket glass ,</l>
       <l n="132">And Impudence with front of brass ;</l>
       <l n="133">And studied Affectation came ,</l>
       <l n="134">Each limb and feature out of frame ;</l>
       <l n="135">While Ignorance , with brain of lead ,</l>
       <l n="136">Flew hovering o'er each female head .</l>
       <l n="137">Why should I ask of thee , my Muse ,</l>
       <l n="138">A hundred tongues , as poets use ,</l>
       <l n="139">When , to give every dame her due ,</l>
       <l n="140">A hundred thousand were too few ?</l>
       <l n="141">Or how should I , alas ! relate</l>
       <l n="142">The sum of all their senseless prate ,</l>
       <l n="143">Their innuendoes , hints , and slanders ,</l>
       <l n="144">Their meanings lewd , and double entendres ?</l>
       <l n="145">Now comes the general scandal charge ;</l>
       <l n="146">What some invent , the rest enlarge ;</l>
       <l n="147">And , “ Madam , if it be a lie ,</l>
       <l n="148">You have the tale as cheap as I ;</l>
       <l n="149">I must conceal my author 's name :</l>
       <l n="150">But now ‘ tis known to common fame . ”</l>
       <l n="151">Say , foolish females , bold and blind ,</l>
       <l n="152">Say , by what fatal turn of mind ,</l>
       <l n="153">Are you on vices most severe ,</l>
       <l n="154">Wherein yourselves have greatest share ?</l>
       <l n="155">Thus every fool herself deludes ;</l>
       <l n="156">The prude condemns the absent prudes :</l>
       <l n="157">Mopsa , who stinks her spouse to death ,</l>
       <l n="158">Accuses Chloe 's tainted breath ;</l>
       <l n="159">Hircina , rank with sweat , presumes</l>
       <l n="160">To censure Phyllis for perfumes ;</l>
       <l n="161">While crooked Cynthia , sneering , says ,</l>
       <l n="162">That Florimel wears iron stays ;</l>
       <l n="163">Chloe , of every coxcomb jealous ,</l>
       <l n="164">Admires how girls can talk with fellows ;</l>
       <l n="165">And , full of indignation , frets ,</l>
       <l n="166">That women should be such coquettes :</l>
       <l n="167">Iris , for scandal most notorious ,</l>
       <l n="168">Cries , “ Lord , the world is so censorious ! ”</l>
       <l n="169">And Rufa , with her combs of lead ,</l>
       <l n="170">Whispers that Sappho 's hair is red :</l>
       <l n="171">Aura , whose tongue you hear a mile hence ,</l>
       <l n="172">Talks half a day in praise of silence ;</l>
       <l n="173">And Sylvia , full of inward guilt ,</l>

       <l n="175">Now voices over voices rise ,</l>
       <l n="176">While each to be the loudest vies :</l>
       <l n="177">They contradict , affirm , dispute ,</l>
       <l n="178">No single tongue one moment mute ;</l>
       <l n="179">All mad to speak , and none to hearken ,</l>
       <l n="180">They set the very lap-dog barking ;</l>
       <l n="181">Their chattering makes a louder din</l>
       <l n="182">Than fishwives o'er a cup of gin ;</l>
       <l n="183">Not schoolboys at a barring out</l>
       <l n="184">Raised ever such incessant rout ;</l>
       <l n="185">The jumbling particles of matter</l>
       <l n="186">In chaos made not such a clatter ;</l>
       <l n="187">Far less the rabble roar and rail ,</l>
       <l n="188">When drunk with sour election ale .</l>
       <l n="189">Nor do they trust their tongues alone ,</l>
       <l n="190">But speak a language of their own ;</l>
       <l n="191">Can read a nod , a shrug , a look ,</l>
       <l n="192">Far better than a printed book ;</l>
       <l n="193">Convey a libel in a frown ,</l>
       <l n="194">And wink a reputation down ;</l>
       <l n="195">Or by the tossing of the fan ,</l>

       <l n="255">You spoke a word began with H ,</l>
       <l n="256">And I know whom you meant to teach ,</l>
       <l n="257">Because you held the king of hearts ;</l>
       <l n="258">Fie , madam , leave these little arts . ”</l>
       <l n="259">“ That 's not so bad as one that rubs</l>
       <l n="260">Her chair to call the king of clubs ;</l>
       <l n="261">And makes her partner understand</l>
       <l n="262">A matadore is in her hand . ”</l>

       <l n="287">Now all in haste they huddle on</l>
       <l n="288">Their hoods , their cloaks , and get them gone ;</l>
       <l n="289">But , first , the winner must invite</l>
       <l n="290">The company to-morrow night .</l>

      <head>THE ELEPHANT ; OR , THE PARLIAMENT MAN</head>
      <head>WRITTEN MANY YEARS SINCE ; AND TAKEN FROM COKE 'S FOURTH INSTITUTE THE HIGH COURT OF PARLIAMENT , CAP . I</head>
      <head>Sir E. Coke says : “ Every member of the house being a counsellor should have three properties of the elephant ; first that he hath no gall ; secondly , that he is inflexible and cannot bow ; thirdly , that he is of a most ripe and perfect memory ... first , to be without gall , that is , without malice , rancor , heat , and envy : ... secondly , that he be constant , inflexible , and not be bowed , or turned from the right either for fear , reward , or favour , nor in judgement respect any person : ... thirdly , of a ripe memory , that they remembering perils past , might prevent dangers to come . ” — W. E. B .</head>
       <l n="1">Ere bribes convince you whom to choose ,</l>
       <l n="2">The precepts of Lord Coke peruse .</l>
       <l n="3">Observe an elephant , says he ,</l>
       <l n="4">And let him like your member be :</l>
       <l n="5">First take a man that 's free from Gaul ,</l>
       <l n="6">For elephants have none at all ;</l>
       <l n="7">In flocks or parties he must keep ;</l>
       <l n="8">For elephants live just like sheep .</l>
       <l n="9">Stubborn in honour he must be ;</l>
       <l n="10">For elephants ne'er bend the knee .</l>
       <l n="11">Last , let his memory be sound ,</l>
       <l n="12">In which your elephant 's profound ;</l>
       <l n="13">That old examples from the wise</l>
       <l n="14">May prompt him in his noes and ayes .</l>
       <l n="15">Thus the Lord Coke hath gravely writ ,</l>
       <l n="16">In all the form of lawyer 's wit :</l>
       <l n="17">And then , with Latin and all that ,</l>
       <l n="18">Shows the comparison is pat .</l>
       <l n="19">Yet in some points my lord is wrong ,</l>
       <l n="20">One 's teeth are sold , and t'other ' s tongue :</l>
       <l n="21">Now , men of parliament , God knows ,</l>
       <l n="22">Are more like elephants of shows ;</l>
       <l n="23">Whose docile memory and sense</l>
       <l n="24">Are turn 'd to trick , to gather pence ;</l>

       <l n="29">Now practise every pliant gesture ,</l>

       <l n="9">The sun , you say , his face has kiss 'd :</l>

       <l n="11">True lawyers , for the wisest ends ,</l>
       <l n="12">Have always been Apollo 's friends .</l>
       <l n="13">Not for his superficial powers</l>
       <l n="14">Of ripening fruits , and gilding flowers ;</l>
       <l n="15">Not for inspiring poets ’ brains</l>

       <l n="19">Nor yet because he sweetly fiddles ;</l>
       <l n="20">Nor for his prophecies in riddles :</l>
       <l n="21">But for a more substantial cause —</l>
       <l n="22">Apollo 's patron of the laws ;</l>
       <l n="23">Whom Paulus ever must adore ,</l>
       <l n="24">As parent of the golden ore ,</l>
       <l n="25">By Phoebus , an incestuous birth ,</l>
       <l n="26">Begot upon his grandam Earth ;</l>

       <l n="29">Then offer 'd at the shrine of Justice ,</l>
       <l n="30">By clients to her priests and trustees .</l>
       <l n="31">Nor , when we see Astraea<span corresp="#note1_61" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>stand</l>

       <l n="37">Now , should I own your case was grievous ,</l>

       <l n="44">To prove that lawyers are so wretched ,</l>
       <l n="45">This paradox I 'll undertake ,</l>
       <l n="46">For Paulus ’ and for Lindsay 's sake ;</l>
       <l n="47">By topics , which , though I abomine ‘ em ,</l>

       <l n="49">Yet I disdain to offer those</l>
       <l n="50">Made use of by detracting foes .</l>
       <l n="51">I own the curses of mankind</l>
       <l n="52">Sit light upon a lawyer 's mind :</l>
       <l n="53">The clamours of ten thousand tongues</l>
       <l n="54">Break not his rest , nor hurt his lungs ;</l>
       <l n="55">I own , his conscience always free ,</l>
       <l n="56">( Provided he has got his fee ,)</l>
       <l n="57">Secure of constant peace within ,</l>
       <l n="58">He knows no guilt , who knows no sin .</l>
       <l n="59">Yet well they merit to be pitied ,</l>
       <l n="60">By clients always overwitted .</l>
       <l n="61">And though the gospel seems to say ,</l>
       <l n="62">What heavy burdens lawyers lay</l>
       <l n="63">Upon the shoulders of their neighbour ,</l>
       <l n="64">Nor lend a finger to their labour ,</l>
       <l n="65">Always for saving their own bacon ;</l>
       <l n="66">No doubt , the text is here mistaken :</l>
       <l n="67">The copy 's false , the sense is rack 'd :</l>
       <l n="68">To prove it , I appeal to fact ;</l>
       <l n="69">And thus by demonstration show</l>
       <l n="70">What burdens lawyers undergo .</l>

      <head>THE LADY 'S DRESSING-ROOM . 1730</head>
       <l n="1">Five hours ( and who can do it less in ? )</l>
       <l n="2">By haughty Celia spent in dressing ;</l>
       <l n="3">The goddess from her chamber issues ,</l>
       <l n="4">Array 'd in lace , brocades , and tissues .</l>
       <l n="5">Strephon , who found the room was void ,</l>
       <l n="6">And Betty otherwise employ 'd ,</l>
       <l n="7">Stole in , and took a strict survey</l>
       <l n="8">Of all the litter as it lay :</l>
       <l n="9">Whereof , to make the matter clear ,</l>
       <l n="10">An inventory follows here .</l>
       <l n="11">And , first , a dirty smock appear 'd ,</l>
       <l n="12">Beneath the arm-pits well besmear 'd ;</l>
       <l n="13">Strephon , the rogue , display 'd it wide ,</l>
       <l n="14">And turn 'd it round on ev'ry side :</l>
       <l n="15">On such a point , few words are best ,</l>
       <l n="16">And Strephon bids us guess the rest ;</l>
       <l n="17">But swears , how damnably the men lie</l>
       <l n="18">In calling Celia sweet and cleanly .</l>
       <l n="19">Now listen , while he next produces</l>
       <l n="20">The various combs for various uses ;</l>
       <l n="21">Fill 'd up with dirt so closely fixt ,</l>
       <l n="22">No brush could force a way betwixt ;</l>
       <l n="23">A paste of composition rare ,</l>
       <l n="24">Sweat , dandriff , powder , lead , and hair :</l>
       <l n="25">A fore-head cloth with oil upo n't ,</l>
       <l n="26">To smooth the wrinkles on her front :</l>
       <l n="27">Here alum-flour , to stop the steams</l>
       <l n="28">Exhaled from sour unsavoury streams :</l>
       <l n="29">There night-gloves made of Tripsey 's hide ,</l>
       <l n="30"><span corresp="#note1_65" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Bequeath 'd by Tripsey when she died ;</l>

       <l n="32">Distil 'd from Tripsey 's darling whelp .</l>
       <l n="33">Here gallipots and vials placed ,</l>
       <l n="34">Some fill 'd with washes , some with paste ;</l>
       <l n="35">Some with pomatums , paints , and slops ,</l>
       <l n="36">And ointments good for scabby chops .</l>
       <l n="37">Hard by a filthy bason stands ,</l>
       <l n="38">Foul 'd with the scouring of her hands :</l>
       <l n="39">The bason takes whatever comes ,</l>
       <l n="40">The scrapings from her teeth and gums ,</l>
       <l n="41">A nasty compound of all hues ,</l>
       <l n="42">For here she spits , and here she spues .</l>
       <l n="43">But , oh ! it turn 'd poor Strephon 's bowels</l>
       <l n="44">When he beheld and smelt the towels ,</l>
       <l n="45">Begumm 'd , bematter 'd , and beslim 'd ,</l>

       <l n="49">Nor be the handkerchiefs forgot ,</l>
       <l n="50">All varnish 'd o'er with snuff and snot .</l>
       <l n="51">The stockings why should I expose ,</l>
       <l n="52">Stain 'd with the moisture of her toes ,<span corresp="#note2_44" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span></l>
       <l n="53">Or greasy coifs , and pinners reeking ,</l>
       <l n="54">Which Celia slept at least a week in ?</l>
       <l n="55">A pair of tweezers next he found ,</l>
       <l n="56">To pluck her brows in arches round ;</l>
       <l n="57">Or hairs that sink the forehead low ,</l>
       <l n="58">Or on her chin like bristles grow .</l>
       <l n="59">The virtues we must not let pass</l>
       <l n="60">Of Celia 's magnifying glass ;</l>
       <l n="61">When frighted Strephon cast his eye o n't ,</l>
       <l n="62">It shew 'd the visage of a giant :</l>
       <l n="63">A glass that can to sight disclose</l>
       <l n="64">The smallest worm in Celia 's nose ,</l>
       <l n="65">And faithfully direct her nail</l>
       <l n="66">To squeeze it out from head to tail ;</l>
       <l n="67">For , catch it nicely by the head ,</l>
       <l n="68">It must come out , alive or dead .</l>
       <l n="69">Why , Strephon , will you tell the rest ?</l>
       <l n="70">And must you needs describe the chest ?</l>
       <l n="71">That careless wench ! no creature warn her</l>
       <l n="72">To move it out from yonder corner !</l>
       <l n="73">But leave it standing full in sight ,</l>
       <l n="74">For you to exercise your spight ?</l>
       <l n="75">In vain the workman shew 'd his wit ,</l>
       <l n="76">With rings and hinges counterfeit ,</l>
       <l n="77">To make it seem in this disguise</l>
       <l n="78">A cabinet to vulgar eyes :</l>
       <l n="79">Which Strephon ventur 'd to look in ,</l>
       <l n="80">Resolved to go thro ’ thick and thin .</l>
       <l n="81">He lifts the lid : there needs no more ,</l>
       <l n="82">He smelt it all the time before .</l>
       <l n="83">As , from within Pandora 's box ,</l>
       <l n="84">When Epimetheus op 'd the locks ,</l>
       <l n="85">A sudden universal crew</l>
       <l n="86">Of human evils upward flew ;</l>
       <l n="87">He still was comforted to find</l>
       <l n="88">That hope at last remain 'd behind :</l>
       <l n="89">So Strephon , lifting up the lid ,</l>
       <l n="90">To view what in the chest was hid ,</l>
       <l n="91">The vapours flew from up the vent ;</l>
       <l n="92">But Strephon , cautious , never meant</l>
       <l n="93">The bottom of the pan to grope ,</l>
       <l n="94">And foul his hands in search of hope .</l>
       <l n="95">O ! ne'er may such a vile machine</l>
       <l n="96">Be once in Celia 's chamber seen !</l>
       <l n="97">O ! may she better learn to keep</l>
       <l n="98">Those “ secrets of the hoary deep . ”<span corresp="#note3_31" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span></l>
       <l n="99">As mutton-cutlets , prime of meat ,</l>
       <l n="100">Which , tho ’ with art you salt and beat ,</l>
       <l n="101">As laws of cookery require ,</l>
       <l n="102">And toast them at the clearest fire ;</l>
       <l n="103">If from upon the hopeful chops</l>
       <l n="104">The fat upon a cinder drops ,</l>
       <l n="105">To stinking smoke it turns the flame ,</l>
       <l n="106">Pois'ning the flesh from whence it came ,</l>
       <l n="107">And up exhales a greasy stench ,</l>
       <l n="108">For which you curse the careless wench :</l>
       <l n="109">So things which must not be exprest ,</l>
       <l n="110">When drop 'd into the reeking chest ,</l>
       <l n="111">Send up an excremental smell</l>
       <l n="112">To taint the part from whence they fell :</l>
       <l n="113">The petticoats and gown perfume ,</l>
       <l n="114">And waft a stink round ev'ry room .</l>
       <l n="115">Thus finishing his grand survey ,</l>
       <l n="116">Disgusted Strephon slunk away ;</l>
       <l n="117">Repeating in his amorous fits ,</l>
       <l n="118">“ Oh ! Celia , Celia , Celia sh —! ”</l>
       <l n="119">But Vengeance , goddess never sleeping ,</l>
       <l n="120">Soon punish 'd Strephon for his peeping :</l>
       <l n="121">His foul imagination links</l>
       <l n="122">Each dame he sees with all her stinks ;</l>
       <l n="123">And , if unsavoury odours fly ,</l>
       <l n="124">Conceives a lady standing by .</l>
       <l n="125">All women his description fits ,</l>
       <l n="126">And both ideas jump like wits ;</l>
       <l n="127">By vicious fancy coupled fast ,</l>
       <l n="128">And still appearing in contrast .</l>
       <l n="129">I pity wretched Strephon , blind</l>
       <l n="130">To all the charms of woman kind .</l>
       <l n="131">Should I the Queen of Love refuse ,</l>
       <l n="132">Because she rose from stinking ooze ?</l>
       <l n="133">To him that looks behind the scene ,</l>
       <l n="134">Statira 's but some pocky quean .</l>
       <l n="135">When Celia in her glory shews ,</l>
       <l n="136">If Strephon would but stop his nose ,</l>
       <l n="137">( Who now so impiously blasphemes</l>
       <l n="138">Her ointments , daubs , and paints , and creams ,</l>
       <l n="139">Her washes , slops , and every clout ,</l>
       <l n="140">With which he makes so foul a rout ;)</l>
       <l n="141">He soon would learn to think like me ,</l>
       <l n="142">And bless his ravish 'd sight to see</l>
       <l n="143">Such order from confusion sprung ,</l>
       <l n="144">Such gaudy tulips raised from dung .</l>

       <l n="4">Conferring , as they used to meet ,</l>
       <l n="5">On love , and books , in rapture sweet ;</l>

       <l n="8">Friend Peter to Cassinus goes ,</l>
       <l n="9">To chat a while , and warm his nose :</l>
       <l n="10">But such a sight was never seen ,</l>
       <l n="11">The lad lay swallow 'd up in spleen .</l>
       <l n="12">He seem 'd as just crept out of bed ;</l>
       <l n="13">One greasy stocking round his head ,</l>
       <l n="14">The other he sat down to darn ,</l>
       <l n="15">With threads of different colour 'd yarn ;</l>
       <l n="16">His breeches torn , exposing wide</l>
       <l n="17">A ragged shirt and tawny hide .</l>
       <l n="18">Scorch 'd were his shins , his legs were bare ,</l>
       <l n="19">But well embrown 'd with dirt and hair</l>
       <l n="20">A rug was o'er his shoulders thrown ,</l>
       <l n="21">( A rug , for nightgown he had none ,)</l>
       <l n="22">His jordan stood in manner fitting</l>
       <l n="23">Between his legs , to spew or spit in ;</l>
       <l n="24">His ancient pipe , in sable dyed ,</l>
       <l n="25">And half unsmoked , lay by his side .</l>
       <l n="26">Him thus accoutred Peter found ,</l>
       <l n="27">With eyes in smoke and weeping drown 'd ;</l>
       <l n="28">The leavings of his last night 's pot</l>
       <l n="29">On embers placed , to drink it hot .</l>
       <l n="30">Why , Cassy , thou wilt dose thy pate :</l>
       <l n="31">What makes thee lie a-bed so late ?</l>
       <l n="32">The finch , the linnet , and the thrush ,</l>
       <l n="33">Their matins chant in every bush ;</l>
       <l n="34">And I have heard thee oft salute</l>

       <l n="36">Heaven send thou hast not got the hyps !</l>
       <l n="37">How ! not a word come from thy lips ?</l>
       <l n="38">Then gave him some familiar thumps ,</l>
       <l n="39">A college joke to cure the dumps .</l>
       <l n="40">The swain at last , with grief opprest ,</l>

       <l n="44">How happy I , were that the worst !</l>
       <l n="45">But I was fated to be curst !</l>
       <l n="46">Come , tell us , has she play 'd the whore ?</l>
       <l n="47">O Peter , would it were no more !</l>
       <l n="48">Why , plague confound her sandy locks !</l>
       <l n="49">Say , has the small or greater pox</l>
       <l n="50">Sunk down her nose , or seam 'd her face ?</l>
       <l n="51">Be easy , ‘ tis a common case .</l>
       <l n="52">O Peter ! beauty 's but a varnish ,</l>

       <l n="63">I know she loves the barber 's boy .</l>
       <l n="64">Friend Peter , this I could excuse ,</l>
       <l n="65">For every nymph has leave to choose ;</l>
       <l n="66">Nor have I reason to complain ,</l>
       <l n="67">She loves a more deserving swain .</l>
       <l n="68">But , oh ! how ill hast thou divined</l>
       <l n="69">A crime , that shocks all human kind ;</l>
       <l n="70">A deed unknown to female race ,</l>
       <l n="71">At which the sun should hide his face :</l>

      <head>A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG NYMPH GOING TO BED .</head>
      <head>WRITTEN FOR THE HONOUR OF THE FAIR SEX . 1731</head>
       <l n="1">Corinna , pride of Drury-Lane ,</l>
       <l n="2">For whom no shepherd sighs in vain ;</l>
       <l n="3">Never did Covent-Garden boast</l>
       <l n="4">So bright a batter 'd strolling toast !</l>
       <l n="5">No drunken rake to pick her up ,</l>
       <l n="6">No cellar where on tick to sup ;</l>
       <l n="7">Returning at the midnight hour ,</l>
       <l n="8">Four stories climbing to her bower ;</l>
       <l n="9">Then , seated on a three-legg 'd chair ,</l>
       <l n="10">Takes off her artificial hair ;</l>
       <l n="11">Now picking out a crystal eye ,</l>
       <l n="12">She wipes it clean , and lays it by .</l>
       <l n="13">Her eyebrows from a mouse 's hide</l>
       <l n="14">Stuck on with art on either side ,</l>
       <l n="15">Pulls off with care , and first displays ‘ em ,</l>
       <l n="16">Then in a play-book smoothly lays ‘ em .</l>
       <l n="17">Now dext'rously her plumpers draws ,</l>
       <l n="18">That serve to fill her hollow jaws ,</l>
       <l n="19">Untwists a wire , and from her gums</l>
       <l n="20">A set of teeth completely comes ;</l>
       <l n="21">Pulls out the rags contrived to prop</l>
       <l n="22">Her flabby dugs , and down they drop .</l>
       <l n="23">Proceeding on , the lovely goddess</l>
       <l n="24">Unlaces next her steel-ribb 'd bodice ,</l>
       <l n="25">Which , by the operator 's skill ,</l>
       <l n="26">Press down the lumps , the hollows fill .</l>
       <l n="27">Up goes her hand , and off she slips</l>
       <l n="28">The bolsters that supply her hips ;</l>
       <l n="29">With gentlest touch she next explores</l>
       <l n="30">Her chancres , issues , running sores ;</l>
       <l n="31">Effects of many a sad disaster ,</l>
       <l n="32">And then to each applies a plaster :</l>
       <l n="33">But must , before she goes to bed ,</l>
       <l n="34">Rub off the daubs of white and red ,</l>
       <l n="35">And smooth the furrows in her front</l>
       <l n="36">With greasy paper stuck upo n't .</l>
       <l n="37">She takes a bolus ere she sleeps ;</l>
       <l n="38">And then between two blankets creeps .</l>
       <l n="39">With pains of love tormented lies ;</l>
       <l n="40">Or , if she chance to close her eyes ,</l>
       <l n="41">Of Bridewell<span corresp="#note1_66" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>and the Compter<span corresp="#note1_67" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>dreams ,</l>
       <l n="42">And feels the lash , and faintly screams ;</l>
       <l n="43">Or , by a faithless bully drawn ,</l>
       <l n="44">At some hedge-tavern lies in pawn ;</l>
       <l n="45">Or to Jamaica<span corresp="#note2_45" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>seems transported</l>
       <l n="46">Alone , and by no planter courted ;</l>
       <l n="47">Or , near Fleet-ditch 's<span corresp="#note3_32" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>oozy brinks ,</l>
       <l n="48">Surrounded with a hundred stinks ,</l>
       <l n="49">Belated , seems on watch to lie ,</l>
       <l n="50">And snap some cully passing by ;</l>
       <l n="51">Or , struck with fear , her fancy runs</l>
       <l n="52">On watchmen , constables , and duns ,</l>
       <l n="53">From whom she meets with frequent rubs ;</l>
       <l n="54">But never from religious clubs ;</l>
       <l n="55">Whose favour she is sure to find ,</l>
       <l n="56">Because she pays them all in kind .</l>
       <l n="57">Corinna wakes . A dreadful sight !</l>
       <l n="58">Behold the ruins of the night !</l>
       <l n="59">A wicked rat her plaster stole ,</l>
       <l n="60">Half eat , and dragg 'd it to his hole .</l>
       <l n="61">The crystal eye , alas ! was miss 'd ;</l>
       <l n="62">And puss had on her plumpers p — st ,</l>
       <l n="63">A pigeon pick 'd her issue-pease :</l>
       <l n="64">And Shock her tresses fill 'd with fleas .</l>
       <l n="65">The nymph , though in this mangled plight</l>
       <l n="66">Must ev'ry morn her limbs unite .</l>
       <l n="67">But how shall I describe her arts</l>
       <l n="68">To re-collect the scatter 'd parts ?</l>
       <l n="69">Or show the anguish , toil , and pain ,</l>
       <l n="70">Of gath'ring up herself again ?</l>
       <l n="71">The bashful Muse will never bear</l>
       <l n="72">In such a scene to interfere .</l>
       <l n="73">Corinna , in the morning dizen 'd ,</l>
       <l n="74">Who sees , will spew ; who smells , be poison 'd .</l>

       <l n="1">Of Chloe all the town has rung ,</l>
       <l n="2">By ev'ry size of poets sung :</l>
       <l n="3">So beautiful a nymph appears</l>
       <l n="4">But once in twenty thousand years ;</l>
       <l n="5">By Nature form 'd with nicest care ,</l>
       <l n="6">And faultless to a single hair .</l>
       <l n="7">Her graceful mien , her shape , and face ,</l>
       <l n="8">Confess 'd her of no mortal race :</l>
       <l n="9">And then so nice , and so genteel ;</l>
       <l n="10">Such cleanliness from head to heel ;</l>
       <l n="11">No humours gross , or frouzy steams ,</l>

       <l n="17">Her dearest comrades never caught her</l>
       <l n="18">Squat on her hams to make maid 's water :</l>
       <l n="19">You 'd swear that so divine a creature</l>
       <l n="20">Felt no necessities of nature .</l>
       <l n="21">In summer had she walk 'd the town ,</l>
       <l n="22">Her armpits would not stain her gown :</l>
       <l n="23">At country dances , not a nose</l>
       <l n="24">Could in the dog-days smell her toes .</l>
       <l n="25">Her milk-white hands , both palms and backs ,</l>
       <l n="26">Like ivory dry , and soft as wax .</l>
       <l n="27">Her hands , the softest ever felt ,</l>
       <l n="28"><span corresp="#note2_46" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Though cold would burn , though dry would melt .</l>
       <l n="29">Dear Venus , hide this wond'rous maid ,</l>
       <l n="30">Nor let her loose to spoil your trade .</l>
       <l n="31">While she engrosses ev'ry swain ,</l>
       <l n="32">You but o'er half the world can reign .</l>
       <l n="33">Think what a case all men are now in ,</l>
       <l n="34">What ogling , sighing , toasting , vowing !</l>
       <l n="35">What powder 'd wigs ! what flames and darts !</l>
       <l n="36">What hampers full of bleeding hearts !</l>
       <l n="37">What sword-knots ! what poetic strains !</l>
       <l n="38">What billets-doux , and clouded canes !</l>
       <l n="39">But Strephon sigh 'd so loud and strong ,</l>
       <l n="40">He blew a settlement along ;</l>
       <l n="41">And bravely drove his rivals down ,</l>

       <l n="70">That now the pair must crown their joys .</l>
       <l n="71">But still the hardest part remains :</l>
       <l n="72">Strephon had long perplex 'd his brains ,</l>
       <l n="73">How with so high a nymph he might</l>
       <l n="74">Demean himself the wedding-night :</l>
       <l n="75">For , as he view 'd his person round ,</l>
       <l n="76">Mere mortal flesh was all he found :</l>
       <l n="77">His hand , his neck , his mouth , and feet ,</l>
       <l n="78">Were duly wash 'd , to keep them sweet ;</l>
       <l n="79">With other parts , that shall be nameless ,</l>
       <l n="80">The ladies else might think me shameless .</l>
       <l n="81">The weather and his love were hot ;</l>
       <l n="82">And , should he struggle , I know what —</l>
       <l n="83">Why , let it go , if I must tell it —</l>
       <l n="84">He 'll sweat , and then the nymph may smell it ;</l>
       <l n="85">While she , a goddess dyed in grain ,</l>
       <l n="86">Was unsusceptible of stain ,</l>
       <l n="87">And , Venus-like , her fragrant skin</l>
       <l n="88">Exhaled ambrosia from within .</l>
       <l n="89">Can such a deity endure</l>
       <l n="90">A mortal human touch impure ?</l>
       <l n="91">How did the humbled swain detest</l>
       <l n="92">His prickly beard , and hairy breast !</l>
       <l n="93">His night-cap , border 'd round with lace ,</l>
       <l n="94">Could give no softness to his face .</l>
       <l n="95">Yet , if the goddess could be kind ,</l>
       <l n="96">What endless raptures must he find !</l>
       <l n="97">And goddesses have now and then</l>
       <l n="98">Come down to visit mortal men ;</l>
       <l n="99">To visit and to court them too :</l>
       <l n="100">A certain goddess , God knows who ,</l>
       <l n="101">( As in a book he heard it read ,)</l>
       <l n="102">Took Col'nel Peleus<span corresp="#note6_12" type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>to her bed .</l>
       <l n="103">But what if he should lose his life</l>
       <l n="104">By vent'ring on his heavenly wife !</l>
       <l n="105">( For Strephon could remember well ,</l>
       <l n="106">That once he heard a school-boy tell ,</l>

       <l n="115">Now , “ ponder well , ye parents dear ; ”</l>
       <l n="116">Forbid your daughters guzzling beer ;</l>
       <l n="117">And make them ev'ry afternoon</l>

       <l n="128">Miss Moll , the jade , will burn it blue ;</l>
       <l n="129">And , when she once has got the art ,</l>

       <l n="131">But out it flies , even when she meets</l>
       <l n="132">Her bridegroom in the wedding-sheets .</l>
       <l n="133">Carminative and diuretic<span corresp="#note9_2" type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span></l>
       <l n="134">Will damp all passion sympathetic ;</l>
       <l n="135">And Love such nicety requires ,</l>
       <l n="136">One blast will put out all his fires .</l>
       <l n="137">Since husbands get behind the scene ,</l>
       <l n="138">The wife should study to be clean ;</l>
       <l n="139">Nor give the smallest room to guess</l>
       <l n="140">The time when wants of nature press ;</l>
       <l n="141">But after marriage practise more</l>
       <l n="142">Decorum than she did before ;</l>
       <l n="143">To keep her spouse deluded still ,</l>
       <l n="144">And make him fancy what she will .</l>
       <l n="145">In bed we left the married pair ;</l>
       <l n="146">‘ Tis time to show how things went there .</l>
       <l n="147">Strephon , who had been often told</l>
       <l n="148">That fortune still assists the bold ,</l>
       <l n="149">Resolved to make the first attack ;</l>
       <l n="150">But Chloe drove him fiercely back .</l>
       <l n="151">How could a nymph so chaste as Chloe ,</l>
       <l n="152">With constitution cold and snowy ,</l>
       <l n="153">Permit a brutish man to touch her ?</l>
       <l n="154">Ev'n lambs by instinct fly the butcher .</l>
       <l n="155">Resistance on the wedding-night</l>
       <l n="156">Is what our maidens claim by right ;</l>
       <l n="157">And Chloe , ‘ tis by all agreed ,</l>
       <l n="158">Was maid in thought , in word , and deed .</l>
       <l n="159">Yet some assign a different reason ;</l>
       <l n="160">That Strephon chose no proper season .</l>
       <l n="161">Say , fair ones , must I make a pause ,</l>
       <l n="162">Or freely tell the secret cause ?</l>
       <l n="163">Twelve cups of tea ( with grief I speak )</l>
       <l n="164">Had now constrain 'd the nymph to leak .</l>
       <l n="165">This point must needs be settled first :</l>
       <l n="166">The bride must either void or burst .</l>
       <l n="167">Then see the dire effects of pease ;</l>
       <l n="168">Think what can give the colic ease .</l>
       <l n="169">The nymph oppress 'd before , behind ,</l>
       <l n="170">As ships are toss 'd by waves and wind ,</l>
       <l n="171">Steals out her hand , by nature led ,</l>
       <l n="172">And brings a vessel into bed ;</l>
       <l n="173">Fair utensil , as smooth and white</l>
       <l n="174">As Chloe 's skin , almost as bright .</l>
       <l n="175">Strephon , who heard the fuming rill</l>

       <l n="187">But soon , with like occasions prest</l>
       <l n="188">He boldly sent his hand in quest</l>

       <l n="302">Contrive your pile to last for life :</l>
       <l n="303">Since beauty scarce endures a day ,</l>
       <l n="304">And youth so swiftly glides away ;</l>
       <l n="305">Why will you make yourself a bubble ,</l>

       <l n="307">On sense and wit your passion found ,</l>

       <l n="9">Those former ages differ 'd much from this ;</l>
       <l n="10">Judas betray 'd his master with a kiss :</l>
       <l n="11">But some have kiss 'd the gospel fifty times ,</l>
       <l n="12">Whose perjury 's the least of all their crimes ;</l>

       <l n="63">Two rows of teeth arm each devouring jaw ,</l>
       <l n="64">And ostrich-like his all-digesting maw .</l>
       <l n="65">My fancy drags this monster to my view ,</l>
       <l n="66">To shew the world his chief reverse in you .</l>
       <l n="67">Of loud unmeaning sounds , a rapid flood</l>
       <l n="68">Rolls from his mouth in plenteous streams of mud ;</l>
       <l n="69">With these the court and senate-house he plies ,</l>
       <l n="70">Made up of noise , and impudence , and lies .</l>
       <l n="71">Now let me show how Bob and you agree :</l>
       <l n="72">You serve a potent prince ,<span corresp="#note7_9" type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>as well as he .</l>
       <l n="73">The ducal coffers trusted to your charge ,</l>
       <l n="74">Your honest care may fill , perhaps enlarge :</l>
       <l n="75">His vassals easy , and the owner blest ;</l>
       <l n="76">They pay a trifle , and enjoy the rest .</l>
       <l n="77">Not so a nation 's revenues are paid ;</l>
       <l n="78">The servant 's faults are on the master laid .</l>
       <l n="79">The people with a sigh their taxes bring ,</l>
       <l n="80">And , cursing Bob , forget to bless the king .</l>
       <l n="81">Next hearken , Gay , to what thy charge requires ,</l>
       <l n="82">With servants , tenants , and the neighbouring squires ,</l>
       <l n="83">Let all domestics feel your gentle sway ;</l>
       <l n="84">Nor bribe , insult , nor flatter , nor betray .</l>
       <l n="85">Let due reward to merit be allow 'd ;</l>
       <l n="86">Nor with your kindred half the palace crowd ;</l>
       <l n="87">Nor think yourself secure in doing wrong ,</l>
       <l n="88">By telling noses<span corresp="#note8_5" type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>with a party strong .</l>
       <l n="89">Be rich ; but of your wealth make no parade ;</l>
       <l n="90">At least , before your master 's debts are paid ;</l>
       <l n="91">Nor in a palace , built with charge immense ,</l>
       <l n="92">Presume to treat him at his own expense .<span corresp="#note9_3" type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span></l>
       <l n="93">Each farmer in the neighbourhood can count</l>
       <l n="94">To what your lawful perquisites amount .</l>
       <l n="95">The tenants poor , the hardness of the times ,</l>
       <l n="96">Are ill excuses for a servant 's crimes .</l>
       <l n="97">With interest , and a premium paid beside ,</l>
       <l n="98">The master 's pressing wants must be supplied ;</l>
       <l n="99">With hasty zeal behold the steward come</l>
       <l n="100">By his own credit to advance the sum ;</l>
       <l n="101">Who , while th'unrighteous Mammon is his friend ,</l>
       <l n="102">May well conclude his power will never end .</l>
       <l n="103">A faithful treasurer ! what could he do more ?</l>
       <l n="104">He lends my lord what was my lord 's before .</l>
       <l n="105">The law so strictly guards the monarch 's health ,</l>
       <l n="106">That no physician dares prescribe by stealth :</l>
       <l n="107">The council sit ; approve the doctor 's skill ;</l>
       <l n="108">And give advice before he gives the pill .</l>
       <l n="109">But the state empiric acts a safer part ;</l>
       <l n="110">And , while he poisons , wins the royal heart .</l>
       <l n="111">But how can I describe the ravenous breed ?</l>
       <l n="112">Then let me now by negatives proceed .</l>
       <l n="113">Suppose your lord a trusty servant send</l>
       <l n="114">On weighty business to some neighbouring friend :</l>
       <l n="115">Presume not , Gay , unless you serve a drone ,</l>
       <l n="116">To countermand his orders by your own .</l>
       <l n="117">Should some imperious neighbour sink the boats ,</l>
       <l n="118">And drain the fish-ponds , while your master dotes ;</l>
       <l n="119">Shall he upon the ducal rights intrench ,</l>
       <l n="120">Because he bribed you with a brace of tench ?</l>
       <l n="121">Nor from your lord his bad condition hide ,</l>
       <l n="122">To feed his luxury , or soothe his pride .</l>
       <l n="123">Nor at an under rate his timber sell ,</l>
       <l n="124">And with an oath assure him , all is well ;</l>
       <l n="125">Or swear it rotten , and with humble airs<span corresp="#note10_2" type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span></l>
       <l n="126">Request it of him , to complete your stairs ;</l>
       <l n="127">Nor , when a mortgage lies on half his lands ,</l>
       <l n="128">Come with a purse of guineas in your hands .</l>
       <l n="129">Have Peter Waters<span corresp="#note11_2" type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>always in your mind ;</l>
       <l n="130">That rogue , of genuine ministerial kind ,</l>
       <l n="131">Can half the peerage by his arts bewitch ,</l>
       <l n="132">Starve twenty lords to make one scoundrel rich :</l>
       <l n="133">And , when he gravely has undone a score ,</l>
       <l n="134">Is humbly pray 'd to ruin twenty more .</l>
       <l n="135">A dext'rous steward , when his tricks are found ,</l>
       <l n="136">Hush-money sends to all the neighbours round ;</l>
       <l n="137">His master , unsuspicious of his pranks ,</l>
       <l n="138">Pays all the cost , and gives the villain thanks .</l>
       <l n="139">And , should a friend attempt to set him right ,</l>
       <l n="140">His lordship would impute it all to spite ;</l>
       <l n="141">Would love his favourite better than before ,</l>
       <l n="142">And trust his honesty just so much more .</l>
       <l n="143">Thus families , like realms , with equal fate ,</l>
       <l n="144">Are sunk by premier ministers of state .</l>
       <l n="145">Some , when an heir succeeds , go bodily on ,</l>
       <l n="146">And , as they robb 'd the father , rob the son .</l>
       <l n="147">A knave , who deep embroils his lord 's affairs ,</l>
       <l n="148">Will soon grow necessary to his heirs .</l>
       <l n="149">His policy consists in setting traps ,</l>
       <l n="150">In finding ways and means , and stopping gaps ;</l>
       <l n="151">He knows a thousand tricks whene'er he please ,</l>
       <l n="152">Though not to cure , yet palliate each disease .</l>
       <l n="153">In either case , an equal chance is run ;</l>
       <l n="154">For , keep or turn him out , my lord 's undone .</l>
       <l n="155">You want a hand to clear a filthy sink ;</l>
       <l n="156">No cleanly workman can endure the stink .</l>
       <l n="157">A strong dilemma in a desperate case !</l>
       <l n="158">To act with infamy , or quit the place .</l>
       <l n="159">A bungler thus , who scarce the nail can hit ,</l>
       <l n="160">With driving wrong will make the panel split :</l>
       <l n="161">Nor dares an abler workman undertake</l>
       <l n="162">To drive a second , lest the whole should break .</l>
       <l n="163">In every court the parallel will hold ;</l>
       <l n="164">And kings , like private folks , are bought and sold .</l>
       <l n="165">The ruling rogue , who dreads to be cashler 'd ,</l>
       <l n="166">Contrives , as he is hated , to be fear 'd ;</l>
       <l n="167">Confounds accounts , perplexes all affairs :</l>
       <l n="168">For vengeance more embroils , than skill repairs .</l>
       <l n="169">So robbers , ( and their ends are just the same ,)</l>
       <l n="170">To ‘ scape inquiries , leave the house in flame .</l>
       <l n="171">I knew a brazen minister of state ,<span corresp="#note12_2" type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span></l>
       <l n="172">Who bore for twice ten years the public hate .</l>
       <l n="173">In every mouth the question most in vogue</l>
       <l n="174">Was , when will they turn out this odious rogue ?</l>
       <l n="175">A juncture happen 'd in his highest pride :</l>
       <l n="176">While he went robbing on , his master died .<span corresp="#note13" type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span></l>
       <l n="177">We thought there now remain 'd no room to doubt ;</l>
       <l n="178">The work is done , the minister must out .</l>
       <l n="179">The court invited more than one or two :</l>
       <l n="180">Will you , Sir Spencer ?<span corresp="#note14" type="note_anchor">[ 14 ]</span>or will you , or you ?</l>
       <l n="181">But not a soul his office durst accept ;</l>
       <l n="182">The subtle knave had all the plunder swept :</l>
       <l n="183">And , such was then the temper of the times ,</l>
       <l n="184">He owed his preservation to his crimes .</l>
       <l n="185">The candidates observed his dirty paws ;</l>
       <l n="186">Nor found it difficult to guess the cause :</l>
       <l n="187">But , when they smelt such foul corruptions round him ,</l>
       <l n="188">Away they fled , and left him as they found him .</l>
       <l n="189">Thus , when a greedy sloven once has thrown</l>
       <l n="190">His snot into the mess , ‘ tis all his own .</l>

      <head>TO A LADY WHO DESIRED THE AUTHOR TO WRITE SOME VERSES UPON HER IN THE HEROIC STYLE</head>
       <l n="1">After venting all my spite ,</l>
       <l n="2">Tell me , what have I to write ?</l>
       <l n="3">Every error I could find</l>
       <l n="4">Through the mazes of your mind ,</l>
       <l n="5">Have my busy Muse employ 'd ,</l>
       <l n="6">Till the company was cloy 'd .</l>
       <l n="7">Are you positive and fretful ,</l>
       <l n="8">Heedless , ignorant , forgetful ?</l>
       <l n="9">Those , and twenty follies more ,</l>
       <l n="10">I have often told before .</l>
       <l n="11">Hearken what my lady says :</l>
       <l n="12">Have I nothing then to praise ?</l>
       <l n="13">Ill it fits you to be witty ,</l>
       <l n="14">Where a fault should move your pity .</l>
       <l n="15">If you think me too conceited ,</l>
       <l n="16">Or to passion quickly heated ;</l>
       <l n="17">If my wandering head be less</l>
       <l n="18">Set on reading than on dress ;</l>
       <l n="19">If I always seem too dull t'ye ;</l>
       <l n="20">I can solve the diffi — culty .</l>
       <l n="21">You would teach me to be wise :</l>
       <l n="22">Truth and honour how to prize ;</l>
       <l n="23">How to shine in conversation ,</l>
       <l n="24">And with credit fill my station ;</l>
       <l n="25">How to relish notions high ;</l>
       <l n="26">How to live , and how to die .</l>
       <l n="27">But it was decreed by Fate —</l>
       <l n="28">Mr. Dean , you come too late .</l>
       <l n="29">Well I know , you can discern ,</l>
       <l n="30">I am now too old to learn :</l>
       <l n="31">Follies , from my youth instill 'd ,</l>
       <l n="32">Have my soul entirely fill 'd ;</l>

       <l n="34">Nor will let your lessons enter .</l>
       <l n="35">Bred a fondling and an heiress ;</l>

       <l n="37">Cocker 'd by the servants round ,</l>
       <l n="38">Was too good to touch the ground ;</l>
       <l n="39">Thought the life of every lady</l>

       <l n="41">Balls , and masquerades , and shows ,</l>
       <l n="42">Visits , plays , and powder 'd beaux .</l>
       <l n="43">Thus you have my case at large ,</l>

       <l n="48">Be reduced into a poem .</l>
       <l n="49">But , I beg , suspend a while</l>
       <l n="50">That same paltry , burlesque style ;</l>

       <l n="52">Turning all to ridicule ;</l>
       <l n="53">Teaching others how to ape you ;</l>

       <l n="59">‘ Tis but just , you should produce ,</l>
       <l n="60">With each fault , each fault 's excuse ;</l>
       <l n="61">Not to publish every trifle ,</l>
       <l n="62">And my few perfections stifle .</l>
       <l n="63">With some gifts at least endow me ,</l>
       <l n="64">Which my very foes allow me .</l>
       <l n="65">Am I spiteful , proud , unjust ?</l>
       <l n="66">Did I ever break my trust ?</l>
       <l n="67">Which of all our modern dames</l>
       <l n="68">Censures less , or less defames ?</l>
       <l n="69">In good manners am I faulty ?</l>
       <l n="70">Can you call me rude or haughty ?</l>
       <l n="71">Did I e'er my mite withhold</l>
       <l n="72">From the impotent and old ?</l>
       <l n="73">When did ever I omit</l>
       <l n="74">Due regard for men of wit ?</l>
       <l n="75">When have I esteem express 'd</l>
       <l n="76">For a coxcomb gaily dress 'd ?</l>
       <l n="77">Do I , like the female tribe ,</l>
       <l n="78">Think it wit to fleer and gibe ?</l>
       <l n="79">Who with less designing ends</l>
       <l n="80">Kindlier entertains her friends ;</l>
       <l n="81">With good words and countenance sprightly ,</l>
       <l n="82">Strives to treat them more politely ?</l>
       <l n="83">Think not cards my chief diversion :</l>
       <l n="84">‘ Tis a wrong , unjust aspersion :</l>
       <l n="85">Never knew I any good in ‘ em ,</l>
       <l n="86">But to dose my head like laudanum .</l>
       <l n="87">We , by play , as men , by drinking ,</l>
       <l n="88">Pass our nights to drive out thinking .</l>
       <l n="89">From my ailments give me leisure ,</l>
       <l n="90">I shall read and think with pleasure ;</l>
       <l n="91">Conversation learn to relish ,</l>

     <p>THE BEASTS ’ CONFESSION TO THE PRIEST , ON OBSERVING HOW MOST MEN MISTAKE THEIR OWN TALENTS . 1732</p>
     <p>PREFACE</p>
     <p>I have been long of opinion , that there is not a more general and greater mistake , or of worse consequences through the commerce of mankind , than the wrong judgments they are apt to entertain of their own talents . I knew a stuttering alderman in London , a great frequenter of coffeehouses , who , when a fresh newspaper was brought in , constantly seized it first , and read it aloud to his brother citizens ; but in a manner as little intelligible to the standers-by as to himself . How many pretenders to learning expose themselves , by choosing to discourse on those very parts of science wherewith they are least acquainted ! It is the same case in every other qualification . By the multitude of those who deal in rhymes , from half a sheet to twenty , which come out every minute , there must be at least five hundred poets in the city and suburbs of London : half as many coffeehouse orators , exclusive of the clergy , forty thousand politicians , and four thousand five hundred profound scholars ; not to mention the wits , the railers , the smart fellows , and critics ; all as illiterate and impudent as a suburb whore . What are we to think of the fine-dressed sparks , proud of their own personal deformities , which appear the more hideous by the contrast of wearing scarlet and gold , with what they call toupees<span corresp="#note1_77" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>on their heads , and all the frippery of a modern beau , to make a figure before women ; some of them with hump-backs , others hardly five feet high , and every feature of their faces distorted : I have seen many of these insipid pretenders entering into conversation with persons of learning , constantly making the grossest blunders in every sentence , without conveying one single idea fit for a rational creature to spend a thought on ; perpetually confounding all chronology , and geography , even of present times . I compute , that London hath eleven native fools of the beau and puppy kind , for one among us in Dublin ; besides two-thirds of ours transplanted thither , who are now naturalized : whereby that overgrown capital exceeds ours in the articles of dunces by forty to one ; and what is more to our farther mortification , there is no one distinguished fool of Irish birth or education , who makes any noise in that famous metropolis , unless the London prints be very partial or defective ; whereas London is seldom without a dozen of their own educating , who engross the vogue for half a winter together , and are never heard of more , but give place to a new set . This has been the constant progress for at least thirty years past , only allowing for the change of breed and fashion .</p>
     <p>The poem is grounded upon the universal folly in mankind of mistaking their talents ; by which the author does a great honour to his own species , almost equalling them with certain brutes ; wherein , indeed , he is too partial , as he freely confesses : and yet he has gone as low as he well could , by specifying four animals ; the wolf , the ass , the swine , and the ape ; all equally mischievous , except the last , who outdoes them in the article of cunning : so great is the pride of man !</p>

       <l n="1">When beasts could speak , ( the learned say</l>
       <l n="2">They still can do so every day ,)</l>
       <l n="3">It seems , they had religion then ,</l>
       <l n="4">As much as now we find in men .</l>
       <l n="5">It happen 'd , when a plague broke out ,</l>
       <l n="6">( Which therefore made them more devout ,)</l>
       <l n="7">The king of brutes ( to make it plain ,</l>
       <l n="8">Of quadrupeds I only mean )</l>
       <l n="9">By proclamation gave command ,</l>
       <l n="10">That every subject in the land</l>
       <l n="11">Should to the priest confess their sins ;</l>
       <l n="12">And thus the pious Wolf begins :</l>
       <l n="13">Good father , I must own with shame ,</l>
       <l n="14">That often I have been to blame :</l>
       <l n="15">I must confess , on Friday last ,</l>
       <l n="16">Wretch that I was ! I broke my fast :</l>
       <l n="17">But I defy the basest tongue</l>
       <l n="18">To prove I did my neighbour wrong ;</l>
       <l n="19">Or ever went to seek my food ,</l>
       <l n="20">By rapine , theft , or thirst of blood .</l>
       <l n="21">The Ass approaching next , confess 'd ,</l>
       <l n="22">That in his heart he loved a jest :</l>
       <l n="23">A wag he was , he needs must own ,</l>
       <l n="24">And could not let a dunce alone :</l>
       <l n="25">Sometimes his friend he would not spare ,</l>
       <l n="26">And might perhaps be too severe :</l>
       <l n="27">But yet the worst that could be said ,</l>
       <l n="28">He was a wit both born and bred ;</l>
       <l n="29">And , if it be a sin and shame ,</l>
       <l n="30">Nature alone must bear the blame :</l>
       <l n="31">One fault he has , is sorry for't ,</l>
       <l n="32">His ears are half a foot too short ;</l>
       <l n="33">Which could he to the standard bring ,</l>
       <l n="34">He 'd show his face before the king :</l>
       <l n="35">Then for his voice , there 's none disputes</l>
       <l n="36">That he 's the nightingale of brutes .</l>
       <l n="37">The Swine with contrite heart allow 'd ,</l>
       <l n="38">His shape and beauty made him proud :</l>
       <l n="39">In diet was perhaps too nice ,</l>
       <l n="40">But gluttony was ne'er his vice :</l>
       <l n="41">In every turn of life content ,</l>
       <l n="42">And meekly took what fortune sent :</l>
       <l n="43">Inquire through all the parish round ,</l>
       <l n="44">A better neighbour ne'er was found ;</l>
       <l n="45">His vigilance might some displease ;</l>
       <l n="46">‘ Tis true , he hated sloth like pease .</l>
       <l n="47">The mimic Ape began his chatter ,</l>
       <l n="48">How evil tongues his life bespatter ;</l>
       <l n="49">Much of the censuring world complain 'd ,</l>
       <l n="50">Who said , his gravity was feign 'd :</l>
       <l n="51">Indeed , the strictness of his morals</l>
       <l n="52">Engaged him in a hundred quarrels :</l>
       <l n="53">He saw , and he was grieved to see't ,</l>
       <l n="54">His zeal was sometimes indiscreet :</l>
       <l n="55">He found his virtues too severe</l>
       <l n="56">For our corrupted times to bear ;</l>
       <l n="57">Yet such a lewd licentious age</l>
       <l n="58">Might well excuse a stoic 's rage .</l>
       <l n="59">The Goat advanced with decent pace ,</l>
       <l n="60">And first excused his youthful face ;</l>
       <l n="61">Forgiveness begg 'd that he appear 'd</l>
       <l n="62">( ‘ Twas Nature 's fault ) without a beard .</l>
       <l n="63">‘ Tis true , he was not much inclined</l>
       <l n="64">To fondness for the female kind :</l>
       <l n="65">Not , as his enemies object ,</l>
       <l n="66">From chance , or natural defect ;</l>
       <l n="67">Not by his frigid constitution ;</l>
       <l n="68">But through a pious resolution :</l>
       <l n="69">For he had made a holy vow</l>
       <l n="70">Of Chastity , as monks do now :</l>
       <l n="71">Which he resolved to keep for ever hence</l>
       <l n="72">And strictly too , as doth his reverence .<span corresp="#note2_51" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span></l>
       <l n="73">Apply the tale , and you shall find ,</l>
       <l n="74">How just it suits with human kind .</l>
       <l n="75">Some faults we own ; but can you guess ?</l>
       <l n="76">— Why , virtue 's carried to excess ,</l>
       <l n="77">Wherewith our vanity endows us ,</l>
       <l n="78">Though neither foe nor friend allows us .</l>
       <l n="79">The Lawyer swears ( you may rely o n't )</l>
       <l n="80">He never squeezed a needy client ;</l>
       <l n="81">And this he makes his constant rule ,</l>
       <l n="82">For which his brethren call him fool ;</l>
       <l n="83">His conscience always was so nice ,</l>
       <l n="84">He freely gave the poor advice ;</l>
       <l n="85">By which he lost , he may affirm ,</l>
       <l n="86">A hundred fees last Easter term ;</l>
       <l n="87">While others of the learned robe ,</l>
       <l n="88">Would break the patience of a Job .</l>
       <l n="89">No pleader at the bar could match</l>
       <l n="90">His diligence and quick dispatch ;</l>
       <l n="91">Ne'er kept a cause , he well may boast ,</l>
       <l n="92">Above a term or two at most .</l>
       <l n="93">The cringing knave , who seeks a place</l>
       <l n="94">Without success , thus tells his case :</l>
       <l n="95">Why should he longer mince the matter ?</l>
       <l n="96">He fail 'd , because he could not flatter ;</l>
       <l n="97">He had not learn 'd to turn his coat ,</l>
       <l n="98">Nor for a party give his vote :</l>
       <l n="99">His crime he quickly understood ;</l>
       <l n="100">Too zealous for the nation 's good :</l>
       <l n="101">He found the ministers resent it ,</l>
       <l n="102">Yet could not for his heart repent it .</l>
       <l n="103">The Chaplain vows , he cannot fawn ,</l>
       <l n="104">Though it would raise him to the lawn :</l>
       <l n="105">He pass 'd his hours among his books ;</l>
       <l n="106">You find it in his meagre looks :</l>
       <l n="107">He might , if he were worldly wise ,</l>
       <l n="108">Preferment get , and spare his eyes ;</l>
       <l n="109">But owns he had a stubborn spirit .</l>
       <l n="110">That made him trust alone to merit ;</l>
       <l n="111">Would rise by merit to promotion ;</l>
       <l n="112">Alas ! a mere chimeric notion .</l>
       <l n="113">The Doctor , if you will believe him ,</l>
       <l n="114">Confess 'd a sin ; ( and God forgive him ! )</l>
       <l n="115">Call 'd up at midnight , ran to save</l>
       <l n="116">A blind old beggar from the grave :</l>
       <l n="117">But see how Satan spreads his snares ;</l>
       <l n="118">He quite forgot to say his prayers .</l>
       <l n="119">He cannot help it , for his heart ,</l>
       <l n="120">Sometimes to act the parson 's part :</l>
       <l n="121">Quotes from the Bible many a sentence ,</l>
       <l n="122">That moves his patients to repentance ;</l>
       <l n="123">And , when his medicines do no good ,</l>
       <l n="124">Supports their minds with heavenly food :</l>
       <l n="125">At which , however well intended ,</l>
       <l n="126">He hears the clergy are offended ;</l>
       <l n="127">And grown so bold behind his back ,</l>
       <l n="128">To call him hypocrite and quack .</l>
       <l n="129">In his own church he keeps a seat ;</l>
       <l n="130">Says grace before and after meat ;</l>
       <l n="131">And calls , without affecting airs ,</l>
       <l n="132">His household twice a-day to prayers .</l>
       <l n="133">He shuns apothecaries ’ shops ,</l>
       <l n="134">And hates to cram the sick with slops :</l>
       <l n="135">He scorns to make his art a trade ;</l>
       <l n="136">Nor bribes my lady 's favourite maid .</l>
       <l n="137">Old nurse-keepers would never hire ,</l>
       <l n="138">To recommend him to the squire ;</l>
       <l n="139">Which others , whom he will not name ,</l>
       <l n="140">Have often practised to their shame .</l>
       <l n="141">The Statesman tells you , with a sneer ,</l>
       <l n="142">His fault is to be too sincere ;</l>
       <l n="143">And having no sinister ends ,</l>
       <l n="144">Is apt to disoblige his friends .</l>
       <l n="145">The nation 's good , his master 's glory ,</l>
       <l n="146">Without regard to Whig or Tory ,</l>
       <l n="147">Were all the schemes he had in view ,</l>
       <l n="148">Yet he was seconded by few :</l>
       <l n="149">Though some had spread a thousand lies ,</l>
       <l n="150">‘ Twas he defeated the excise .<span corresp="#note3_37" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span></l>
       <l n="151">‘ Twas known , though he had borne aspersion ,</l>
       <l n="152">That standing troops were his aversion :</l>
       <l n="153">His practice was , in every station :</l>
       <l n="154">To serve the king , and please the nation .</l>
       <l n="155">Though hard to find in every case</l>
       <l n="156">The fittest man to fill a place :</l>
       <l n="157">His promises he ne'er forgot ,</l>
       <l n="158">But took memorials on the spot ;</l>
       <l n="159">His enemies , for want of charity ,</l>
       <l n="160">Said , he affected popularity :</l>
       <l n="161">‘ Tis true , the people understood ,</l>
       <l n="162">That all he did was for their good ;</l>
       <l n="163">Their kind affections he has tried ;</l>
       <l n="164">No love is lost on either side .</l>
       <l n="165">He came to court with fortune clear ,</l>
       <l n="166">Which now he runs out every year ;</l>
       <l n="167">Must , at the rate that he goes on ,</l>
       <l n="168">Inevitably be undone :</l>
       <l n="169">O ! if his majesty would please</l>
       <l n="170">To give him but a writ of ease ,</l>
       <l n="171">Would grant him license to retire ,</l>
       <l n="172">As it has long been his desire ,</l>
       <l n="173">By fair accounts it would be found ,</l>
       <l n="174">He 's poorer by ten thousand pound .</l>
       <l n="175">He owns , and hopes it is no sin ,</l>
       <l n="176">He ne'er was partial to his kin ;</l>
       <l n="177">He thought it base for men in stations ,</l>
       <l n="178">To crowd the court with their relations :</l>
       <l n="179">His country was his dearest mother ,</l>
       <l n="180">And every virtuous man his brother ;</l>
       <l n="181">Through modesty or awkward shame ,</l>
       <l n="182">( For which he owns himself to blame ,)</l>
       <l n="183">He found the wisest man he could ,</l>
       <l n="184">Without respect to friends or blood ;</l>
       <l n="185">Nor ever acts on private views ,</l>
       <l n="186">When he has liberty to choose .</l>
       <l n="187">The Sharper swore he hated play ,</l>
       <l n="188">Except to pass an hour away :</l>
       <l n="189">And well he might ; for , to his cost ,</l>
       <l n="190">By want of skill , he always lost ;</l>
       <l n="191">He heard there was a club of cheats ,</l>
       <l n="192">Who had contrived a thousand feats ;</l>
       <l n="193">Could change the stock , or cog a die ,</l>
       <l n="194">And thus deceive the sharpest eye :</l>
       <l n="195">Nor wonder how his fortune sunk ,</l>
       <l n="196">His brothers fleece him when he 's drunk .</l>
       <l n="197">I own the moral not exact ,</l>
       <l n="198">Besides , the tale is false , in fact ;</l>
       <l n="199">And so absurd , that could I raise up ,</l>
       <l n="200">From fields Elysian , fabling Æsop ,</l>
       <l n="201">I would accuse him to his face ,</l>
       <l n="202">For libelling the four-foot race .</l>
       <l n="203">Creatures of every kind but ours</l>
       <l n="204">Well comprehend their natural powers ,</l>
       <l n="205">While we , whom reason ought to sway ,</l>
       <l n="206">Mistake our talents every day .</l>
       <l n="207">The Ass was never known so stupid ,</l>
       <l n="208">To act the part of Tray or Cupid ;</l>
       <l n="209">Nor leaps upon his master 's lap ,</l>
       <l n="210">There to be stroked , and fed with pap ,</l>
       <l n="211">As Æsop would the world persuade ;</l>
       <l n="212">He better understands his trade :</l>

      <head>THE STORM</head>
      <head>MINERVA 'S PETITION</head>
       <l n="1">Pallas , a goddess chaste and wise</l>
       <l n="2">Descending lately from the skies ,</l>
       <l n="3">To Neptune went , and begg 'd in form</l>
       <l n="4">He 'd give his orders for a storm ;</l>
       <l n="5">A storm , to drown that rascal Hort ,<span corresp="#note1_78" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></l>
       <l n="6">And she would kindly thank him for't :</l>
       <l n="7">A wretch ! whom English rogues , to spite her ,</l>
       <l n="8">Had lately honour 'd with a mitre .</l>
       <l n="9">The god , who favour 'd her request ,</l>
       <l n="10">Assured her he would do his best :</l>
       <l n="11">But Venus had been there before ,</l>
       <l n="12">Pleaded the bishop loved a whore ,</l>
       <l n="13">And had enlarged her empire wide ;</l>
       <l n="14">He own 'd no deity beside .</l>
       <l n="15">At sea or land , if e'er you found him</l>
       <l n="16">Without a mistress , hang or drown him .</l>
       <l n="17">Since Burnet 's death , the bishops ’ bench ,</l>
       <l n="18">Till Hort arrived , ne'er kept a wench ;</l>
       <l n="19">If Hort must sink , she grieves to tell it ,</l>
       <l n="20">She 'll not have left one single prelate :</l>
       <l n="21">For , to say truth , she did intend him ,</l>
       <l n="22">Elect of Cyprus in commendam .</l>
       <l n="23">And , since her birth the ocean gave her ,</l>
       <l n="24">She could not doubt her uncle 's favour .</l>
       <l n="25">Then Proteus urged the same request ,</l>
       <l n="26">But half in earnest , half in jest ;</l>
       <l n="27">Said he — “ Great sovereign of the main ,</l>
       <l n="28">To drown him all attempts are vain .</l>
       <l n="29">Hort can assume more forms than I ,</l>
       <l n="30">A rake , a bully , pimp , or spy ;</l>
       <l n="31">Can creep , or run , or fly , or swim ;</l>
       <l n="32">All motions are alike to him :</l>
       <l n="33">Turn him adrift , and you shall find</l>
       <l n="34">He knows to sail with every wind ;</l>

       <l n="58">You soon shall see him soundly tost .</l>
       <l n="59">You 'll find him swear , blaspheme , and damn</l>
       <l n="60">( And every moment take a dram )</l>
       <l n="61">His ghastly visage with an air</l>
       <l n="62">Of reprobation and despair ;</l>
       <l n="63">Or else some hiding-hole he seeks ,</l>
       <l n="64">For fear the rest should say he squeaks ;</l>
       <l n="65">Or , as Fitzpatrick<span corresp="#note5_23" type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>did before ,</l>
       <l n="66">Resolve to perish with his whore ;</l>
       <l n="67">Or else he raves , and roars , and swears ,</l>
       <l n="68">And , but for shame , would say his prayers .</l>
       <l n="69">Or , would you see his spirits sink ?</l>
       <l n="70">Relaxing downwards in a stink ?</l>
       <l n="71">If such a sight as this can please ye ,</l>
       <l n="72">Good madam Pallas , pray be easy .</l>
       <l n="73">To Neptune speak , and he 'll consent ;</l>

In a letter to Pope , dated 1 May , that year , the Dean complained seriously about the imposture , saying , “ it shall not provoke me to print the true one , which indeed is not proper to be seen till I can be seen no more . ” See Swift to Pope , in Pope 's Works , edit .

The queen , then princess , sent a dozen times to the Dean ( then in London ) , with her commands to attend her ; which at last he did , by advice of all his friends . She often sent for him afterwards , and always treated him very graciously . He taxed her with a present worth £ 10 , which she promised before he should return to Ireland ; but on his taking leave the medals were not ready .</note>

     <note xml:id="note8_6" place="bottom" n="8">The medals were to be sent to the Dean in four months ; but she forgot or thought them too dear . The Dean , being in Ireland , sent Mrs. Howard a piece of plaid made in that kingdom , which the queen seeing took it from her and wore it herself and sent to the Dean for as much as would clothe herself and children , desiring he would send the charge of it ; he did the former , it cost £ 35 , but he said he would have nothing except the medals ; he went next summer to England , and was treated as usual , and she being then queen , the Dean was promised a settlement in England , but returned as he went , and instead of receiving of her intended favours or the medals , hath been ever since under Her Majesty 's displeasure .</note>

He had a way of insinuating himself into all ministers , under every change , either as pimp , flatterer , or informer . He was tried at seventy for a rape , and came off by sacrificing a great part of his fortune . He is since dead ; but this poem still preserves the scene and time it was writ in .— Dublin Edition , and see ante , p . 191 .— W . E. B .</note>
     <note xml:id="note10_3" place="bottom" n="10">Sir Robert Walpole , chief minister of state , treated the Dean in 1726 with great distinction ; invited him to dinner at Chelsea , with the Dean 's friends chosen on purpose : appointed an hour to talk with him of Ireland , to which kingdom and people the Dean found him no great friend ; for he defended Wood 's project of halfpence , etc . The Dean would see him no more ; and upon his next year 's return to England , Sir Robert , on an accidental meeting , only made a civil compliment , and never invited him again .</note>

The Dean , who was the only person that endeavoured to reconcile them , found it impossible , and thereupon retired to the country about ten weeks before that event : upon which he returned to his deanery in Dublin , where for many years he was worryed by the new people in power , and had hundreds of libels writ against him in England .</note>

The greatest preferments in the Church , in both kingdoms , were given to the most ignorant men .

      <docTitle><titlePart>ON POETRY A RHAPSODY . 1733</titlePart></docTitle>
      <docImprint>All human race would fain be wits , And millions miss for one that hits . Young 's universal passion , pride ,<span corresp="#note1_82" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Was never known to spread so wide . Say , Britain , could you ever boast Three poets in an age at most ? Our chilling climate hardly bears A sprig of bays in fifty years ; While every fool his claim alleges , As if it grew in common hedges . What reason can there be assign 'd For this perverseness in the mind ? Brutes find out where their talents lie : A bear will not attempt to fly ; A founder 'd horse will oft debate , Before he tries a five-barr 'd gate ; A dog by instinct turns aside , Who sees the ditch too deep and wide . But man we find the only creature Who , led by Folly , combats Nature ; Who , when she loudly cries , Forbear , With obstinacy fixes there ; And , where his genius least inclines , Absurdly bends his whole designs . Not empire to the rising sun By valour , conduct , fortune won ; Not highest wisdom in debates , For framing laws to govern states ; Not skill in sciences profound So large to grasp the circle round , Such heavenly influence require , As how to strike the Muse 's lyre . Not beggar 's brat on bulk begot ; Not bastard of a pedler Scot ; Not boy brought up to cleaning shoes , The spawn of Bridewell<span corresp="#note2_54" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>or the stews ; Not infants dropp 'd , the spurious pledges Of gipsies litter 'd under hedges ; Are so disqualified by fate To rise in church , or law , or state , As he whom Phoebus in his ire Has blasted with poetic fire . What hope of custom in the fair , While not a soul demands your ware ? Where you have nothing to produce For private life , or public use ? Court , city , country , want you not ; You cannot bribe , betray , or plot . For poets , law makes no provision ; The wealthy have you in derision : Of state affairs you cannot smatter ; Are awkward when you try to flatter ; Your portion , taking Britain round , Was just one annual hundred pound ; Now not so much as in remainder , Since Cibber<span corresp="#note3_40" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>brought in an attainder ; For ever fix 'd by right divine ( A monarch 's right ) on Grub Street line . Poor starv'ling bard , how small thy gains ! How unproportion 'd to thy pains ! And here a simile comes pat in : Though chickens take a month to fatten , The guests in less than half an hour Will more than half a score devour . So , after toiling twenty days To earn a stock of pence and praise , Thy labours , grown the critic 's prey , Are swallow 'd o'er a dish of tea ; Gone to be never heard of more , Gone where the chickens went before . How shall a new attempter learn Of different spirits to discern , And how distinguish which is which , The poet 's vein , or scribbling itch ? Then hear an old experienced sinner , Instructing thus a young beginner . Consult yourself ; and if you find A powerful impulse urge your mind , Impartial judge within your breast What subject you can manage best ; Whether your genius most inclines To satire , praise , or humorous lines , To elegies in mournful tone , Or prologue sent from hand unknown . Then , rising with Aurora 's light , The Muse invoked , sit down to write ; Blot out , correct , insert , refine , Enlarge , diminish , interline ; Be mindful , when invention fails , To scratch your head , and bite your nails . Your poem finish 'd , next your care Is needful to transcribe it fair . In modern wit all printed trash is Set off with numerous breaks and dashes . To statesmen would you give a wipe , You print it in Italic type . When letters are in vulgar shapes , ‘ Tis ten to one the wit escapes : But , when in capitals express 'd , The dullest reader smokes the jest : Or else perhaps he may invent A better than the poet meant ; As learned commentators view In Homer more than Homer knew . Your poem in its modish dress , Correctly fitted for the press , Convey by penny-post to Lintot ,<span corresp="#note4_29" type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>But let no friend alive look into't . If Lintot thinks ‘ twill quit the cost , You need not fear your labour lost : And how agreeably surprised Are you to see it advertised ! The hawker shows you one in print , As fresh as farthings from the mint : The product of your toil and sweating ; A bastard of your own begetting . Be sure at Will 's ,<span corresp="#note5_25" type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>the following day , Lie snug , and hear what critics say ; And , if you find the general vogue Pronounces you a stupid rogue , Damns all your thoughts as low and little , Sit still , and swallow down your spittle ; Be silent as a politician , For talking may beget suspicion ; Or praise the judgment of the town , And help yourself to run it down . Give up your fond paternal pride , Nor argue on the weaker side : For , poems read without a name We justly praise , or justly blame ; And critics have no partial views , Except they know whom they abuse : And since you ne'er provoke their spite , Depend upo n't their judgment 's right . But if you blab , you are undone : Consider what a risk you run : You lose your credit all at once ; The town will mark you for a dunce ; The vilest dogg'rel Grub Street sends , Will pass for yours with foes and friends ; And you must bear the whole disgrace , Till some fresh blockhead takes your place . Your secret kept , your poem sunk , And sent in quires to line a trunk , If still you be disposed to rhyme , Go try your hand a second time . Again you fail : yet Safe 's the word ; Take courage and attempt a third . But first with care employ your thoughts Where critics mark 'd your former faults ; The trivial turns , the borrow 'd wit , The similes that nothing fit ; The cant which every fool repeats , Town jests and coffeehouse conceits , Descriptions tedious , flat , and dry , And introduced the Lord knows why : Or where we find your fury set Against the harmless alphabet ; On A 's and B 's your malice vent , While readers wonder whom you meant : A public or a private robber , A statesman , or a South Sea jobber ; A prelate , who no God believes ; A parliament , or den of thieves ; A pickpurse at the bar or bench , A duchess , or a suburb wench : Or oft , when epithets you link , In gaping lines to fill a chink ; Like stepping-stones , to save a stride , In streets where kennels are too wide ; Or like a heel-piece , to support A cripple with one foot too short ; Or like a bridge , that joins a marish To moorlands of a different parish . So have I seen ill-coupled hounds Drag different ways in miry grounds . So geographers , in Afric maps , With savage pictures fill their gaps , And o'er unhabitable downs Place elephants for want of towns . But , though you miss your third essay , You need not throw your pen away . Lay now aside all thoughts of fame , To spring more profitable game . From party merit seek support ; The vilest verse thrives best at court . And may you ever have the luck To rhyme almost as ill as Duck ;<span corresp="#note6_16" type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>And , though you never learn 'd to scan verse Come out with some lampoon on D'Anvers . A pamphlet in Sir Bob 's defence Will never fail to bring in pence : Nor be concern 'd about the sale , He pays his workmen on the nail .<span corresp="#note7_11" type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>Display the blessings of the nation , And praise the whole administration . Extol the bench of bishops round , Who at them rail , bid —— confound ; To bishop-haters answer thus : ( The only logic used by us ) What though they do n't believe in —— Deny them Protestants — thou lyest . A prince , the moment he is crown 'd , Inherits every virtue round , As emblems of the sovereign power , Like other baubles in the Tower ; Is generous , valiant , just , and wise , And so continues till he dies : His humble senate this professes , In all their speeches , votes , addresses . But once you fix him in a tomb , His virtues fade , his vices bloom ; And each perfection , wrong imputed , Is fully at his death confuted . The loads of poems in his praise , Ascending , make one funeral blaze : His panegyrics then are ceased , He grows a tyrant , dunce , or beast . As soon as you can hear his knell , This god on earth turns devil in hell : And lo ! his ministers of state , Transform 'd to imps , his levee wait ; Where in the scenes of endless woe , They ply their former arts below ; And as they sail in Charon 's boat , Contrive to bribe the judge 's vote ; To Cerberus they give a sop , His triple barking mouth to stop ; Or , in the ivory gate of dreams ,<span corresp="#note8_7" type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>Project excise and South-Sea<span corresp="#note9_5" type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>schemes ; Or hire their party pamphleteers To set Elysium by the ears . Then , poet , if you mean to thrive , Employ your muse on kings alive ; With prudence gathering up a cluster Of all the virtues you can muster , Which , form 'd into a garland sweet , Lay humbly at your monarch 's feet : Who , as the odours reach his throne , Will smile , and think them all his own ; For law and gospel both determine All virtues lodge in royal ermine : I mean the oracles of both , Who shall depose it upon oath . Your garland , in the following reign , Change but the names , will do again . But , if you think this trade too base , ( Which seldom is the dunce 's case ) Put on the critic 's brow , and sit At Will 's , the puny judge of wit . A nod , a shrug , a scornful smile , With caution used , may serve a while . Proceed no further in your part , Before you learn the terms of art ; For you can never be too far gone In all our modern critics ’ jargon : Then talk with more authentic face Of unities , in time and place : Get scraps of Horace from your friends , And have them at your fingers ’ ends ; Learn Aristotle 's rules by rote , And at all hazards boldly quote ; Judicious Rymer<span corresp="#note10_4" type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>oft review , Wise Dennis ,<span corresp="#note11_4" type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>and profound Bossu .<span corresp="#note12_4" type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span>Read all the prefaces of Dryden , For these our critics much confide in ; Though merely writ at first for filling , To raise the volume 's price a shilling . A forward critic often dupes us With sham quotations peri hupsous : And if we have not read Longinus , Will magisterially outshine us . Then , lest with Greek he overrun ye , Procure the book for love or money , Translated from Boileau 's translation ,<span corresp="#note13_3" type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span>And quote quotation on quotation . At Will 's you hear a poem read , Where Battus<span corresp="#note14_3" type="note_anchor">[ 14 ]</span>from the table head , Reclining on his elbow-chair , Gives judgment with decisive air ; To whom the tribe of circling wits As to an oracle submits . He gives directions to the town , To cry it up , or run it down ; Like courtiers , when they send a note , Instructing members how to vote . He sets the stamp of bad and good , Though not a word be understood . Your lesson learn 'd , you 'll be secure To get the name of connoisseur : And , when your merits once are known , Procure disciples of your own . For poets ( you can never want ‘ em ) Spread through Augusta Trinobantum ,<span corresp="#note15" type="note_anchor">[ 15 ]</span>Computing by their pecks of coals , Amount to just nine thousand souls : These o'er their proper districts govern , Of wit and humour judges sovereign . In every street a city bard Rules , like an alderman , his ward ; His undisputed rights extend Through all the lane , from end to end ; The neighbours round admire his shrewdness For songs of loyalty and lewdness ; Outdone by none in rhyming well , Although he never learn 'd to spell . Two bordering wits contend for glory ; And one is Whig , and one is Tory : And this , for epics claims the bays , And that , for elegiac lays : Some famed for numbers soft and smooth , By lovers spoke in Punch 's booth ; And some as justly fame extols For lofty lines in Smithfield drolls . Bavius<span corresp="#note16" type="note_anchor">[ 16 ]</span>in Wapping gains renown , And Mævius<span corresp="#note16_2" type="note_anchor">[ 16 ]</span>reigns o'er Kentish town : Tigellius<span corresp="#note17_2" type="note_anchor">[ 17 ]</span>placed in Phooebus ’ car From Ludgate shines to Temple-bar : Harmonious Cibber entertains The court with annual birth-day strains ; Whence Gay was banish 'd in disgrace ;<span corresp="#note18_2" type="note_anchor">[ 18 ]</span>Where Pope will never show his face ; Where Young must torture his invention To flatter knaves or lose his pension .<span corresp="#note19_2" type="note_anchor">[ 19 ]</span>But these are not a thousandth part Of jobbers in the poet 's art , Attending each his proper station , And all in due subordination , Through every alley to be found , In garrets high , or under ground ; And when they join their pericranies , Out skips a book of miscellanies . Hobbes clearly proves , that every creature Lives in a state of war by nature .<span corresp="#note20_2" type="note_anchor">[ 20 ]</span>The greater for the smaller watch , But meddle seldom with their match . A whale of moderate size will draw A shoal of herrings down his maw ; A fox with geese his belly crams ; A wolf destroys a thousand lambs ; But search among the rhyming race , The brave are worried by the base . If on Parnassus ’ top you sit , You rarely bite , are always bit : Each poet of inferior size On you shall rail and criticise , And strive to tear you limb from limb ; While others do as much for him . The vermin only teaze and pinch Their foes superior by an inch . So , naturalists observe , a flea Has smaller fleas that on him prey ; And these have smaller still to bite ‘ em , And so proceed ad infinitum . Thus every poet , in his kind , Is bit by him that comes behind : Who , though too little to be seen , Can teaze , and gall , and give the spleen ; Call dunces , fools , and sons of whores , Lay Grub Street at each other 's doors ; Extol the Greek and Roman masters , And curse our modern poetasters ; Complain , as many an ancient bard did , How genius is no more rewarded ; How wrong a taste prevails among us ; How much our ancestors outsung us : Can personate an awkward scorn For those who are not poets born ; And all their brother dunces lash , Who crowd the press with hourly trash . O Grub Street ! how do I bemoan thee , Whose graceless children scorn to own thee ! Their filial piety forgot , Deny their country , like a Scot ; Though by their idiom and grimace , They soon betray their native place : Yet thou hast greater cause to be Ashamed of them , than they of thee , Degenerate from their ancient brood Since first the court allow 'd them food . Remains a difficulty still , To purchase fame by writing ill. From Flecknoe<span corresp="#note21_2" type="note_anchor">[ 21 ]</span>down to Howard 's<span corresp="#note22_2" type="note_anchor">[ 22 ]</span>time , How few have reach 'd the low sublime ! For when our high-born Howard died , Blackmore<span corresp="#note23_2" type="note_anchor">[ 23 ]</span>alone his place supplied : And lest a chasm should intervene , When death had finish 'd Blackmore 's reign , The leaden crown devolved to thee , Great poet<span corresp="#note24_2" type="note_anchor">[ 24 ]</span>of the “ Hollow Tree . ” But ah ! how unsecure thy throne ! A thousand bards thy right disown : They plot to turn , in factious zeal , Duncenia to a common weal ; And with rebellious arms pretend An equal privilege to descend . In bulk there are not more degrees From elephants to mites in cheese , Than what a curious eye may trace In creatures of the rhyming race . From bad to worse , and worse they fall ; But who can reach the worst of all ? For though , in nature , depth and height Are equally held infinite : In poetry , the height we know ; ‘ Tis only infinite below . For instance : when you rashly think , No rhymer can like Welsted sink , His merits balanced , you shall find The Laureate leaves him far behind . Concanen ,<span corresp="#note25_2" type="note_anchor">[ 25 ]</span>more aspiring bard , Soars downward deeper by a yard . Smart Jemmy Moore<span corresp="#note26_2" type="note_anchor">[ 26 ]</span>with vigour drops ; The rest pursue as thick as hops : With heads to point the gulf they enter , Link 'd perpendicular to the centre ; And as their heels elated rise , Their heads attempt the nether skies . O , what indignity and shame , To prostitute the Muses ’ name ! By flattering kings , whom Heaven design 'd The plagues and scourges of mankind ; Bred up in ignorance and sloth , And every vice that nurses both . Perhaps you say , Augustus shines , Immortal made in Virgil 's lines , And Horace brought the tuneful quire , To sing his virtues on the lyre ; Without reproach for flattery , true , Because their praises were his due . For in those ages kings , we find , Were animals of human kind . But now , go search all Europe round Among the savage monsters —— With vice polluting every throne , ( I mean all thrones except our own ;) In vain you make the strictest view To find a —— in all the crew , With whom a footman out of place Would not conceive a high disgrace , A burning shame , a crying sin , To take his morning 's cup of gin . Thus all are destined to obey Some beast of burthen or of prey . ‘ Tis sung , Prometheus ,<span corresp="#note27_2" type="note_anchor">[ 27 ]</span>forming man , Through all the brutal species ran , Each proper quality to find Adapted to a human mind ; A mingled mass of good and bad , The best and worst that could be had ; Then from a clay of mixture base He shaped a —— to rule the race , Endow 'd with gifts from every brute That best the * * nature suit . Thus think on —— s : the name denotes Hogs , asses , wolves , baboons , and goats . To represent in figure just , Sloth , folly , rapine , mischief , lust ; Oh ! were they all but Neb-cadnezers , What herds of —— s would turn to grazers ! Fair Britain , in thy monarch blest , Whose virtues bear the strictest test ; Whom never faction could bespatter , Nor minister nor poet flatter ; What justice in rewarding merit ! What magnanimity of spirit ! What lineaments divine we trace Through all his figure , mien , and face ! Though peace with olive binds his hands , Confess 'd the conquering hero stands . Hydaspes ,<span corresp="#note28_2" type="note_anchor">[ 28 ]</span>Indus , and the Ganges , Dread from his hand impending changes .

The consort of his throne and bed , A perfect goddess born and bred , Appointed sovereign judge to sit On learning , eloquence , and wit . Our eldest hope , divine Iülus ,<span corresp="#note30_2" type="note_anchor">[ 30 ]</span>( Late , very late , O may he rule us ! ) What early manhood has he shown , Before his downy beard was grown , Then think , what wonders will be done By going on as he begun , An heir for Britain to secure As long as sun and moon endure . The remnant of the royal blood Comes pouring on me like a flood . Bright goddesses , in number five ; Duke William , sweetest prince alive . Now sing the minister of state , Who shines alone without a mate . Observe with what majestic port This Atlas stands to prop the court : Intent the public debts to pay , Like prudent Fabius ,<span corresp="#note31_2" type="note_anchor">[ 31 ]</span>by delay . Thou great vicegerent of the king , Thy praises every Muse shall sing ! In all affairs thou sole director ; Of wit and learning chief protector , Though small the time thou hast to spare , The church is thy peculiar care . Of pious prelates what a stock You choose to rule the sable flock ! You raise the honour of the peerage , Proud to attend you at the steerage . You dignify the noble race , Content yourself with humbler place . Now learning , valour , virtue , sense , To titles give the sole pretence . St. George beheld thee with delight , Vouchsafe to be an azure knight , When on thy breast and sides Herculean , He fix 'd the star and string cerulean . Say , poet , in what other nation Shone ever such a constellation ! Attend , ye Popes , and Youngs , and Gays , And tune your harps , and strew your bays : Your panegyrics here provide ; You cannot err on flattery 's side . Above the stars exalt your style , You still are low ten thousand mile . On Lewis all his bards bestow 'd Of incense many a thousand load ; But Europe mortified his pride , And swore the fawning rascals lied . Yet what the world refused to Lewis , Applied to George , exactly true is . Exactly true ! invidious poet ! ‘ Tis fifty thousand times below it . Translate me now some lines , if you can , From Virgil , Martial , Ovid , Lucan . They could all power in Heaven divide , And do no wrong on either side ; They teach you how to split a hair , Give George and Jove an equal share .<span corresp="#note32_2" type="note_anchor">[ 32 ]</span>Yet why should we be laced so strait ? I 'll give my monarch butter-weight . And reason good ; for many a year Jove never intermeddled here : Nor , though his priests be duly paid , Did ever we desire his aid : We now can better do without him , Since Woolston gave us arms to rout him . Caetera desiderantur .</docImprint>

     <p>VERSES WRITTEN DURING LORD CARTERET 'S ADMINISTRATION OF IRELAND</p>
     <p>As Lord Carteret 's residence in Ireland as Viceroy was a series of cabals against the authority of the Prime Minister , he failed not , as well from his love of literature as from his hatred to Walpole , to attach to himself as much as possible the distinguished author of the Drapier Letters . By the interest which Swift soon gained with the Lord-Lieutenant , he was enabled to recommend several friends , whose High Church or Tory principles had hitherto obstructed their preferment . The task of forwarding the views of Delany , in particular , led to several of Swift 's liveliest poetical effusions , while , on the other hand , he was equally active in galling , by his satire , Smedley , and other Whig beaux esprits , who , during this amphibious administration , sought the favour of a literary Lord-Lieutenant , by literary offerings and poetical adulation . These pieces , with one or two connected with the same subject , are here thrown together , as they seem to reflect light upon each other .— Scott .</p>

      <head>AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET</head>
       <l n="1">A lady , wise as well as fair ,</l>
       <l n="2">Whose conscience always was her care ,</l>
       <l n="3">Thoughtful upon a point of moment ,</l>
       <l n="4">Would have the text as well as comment :</l>
       <l n="5">So hearing of a grave divine ,</l>
       <l n="6">She sent to bid him come to dine .</l>
       <l n="7">But , you must know he was not quite</l>
       <l n="8">So grave as to be unpolite :</l>
       <l n="9">Thought human learning would not lessen</l>
       <l n="10">The dignity of his profession :</l>
       <l n="11">And if you 'd heard the man discourse ,</l>
       <l n="12">Or preach , you 'd like him scarce the worse .</l>
       <l n="13">He long had bid the court farewell ,</l>
       <l n="14">Retreating silent to his cell ;</l>
       <l n="15">Suspected for the love he bore</l>
       <l n="16">To one who sway 'd some time before ;</l>
       <l n="17">Which made it more surprising how</l>
       <l n="18">He should be sent for thither now .</l>
       <l n="19">The message told , he gapes , and stares ,</l>
       <l n="20">And scarce believes his eyes or ears :</l>
       <l n="21">Could not conceive what it should mean ,</l>
       <l n="22">And fain would hear it told again .</l>
       <l n="23">But then the squire so trim and nice ,</l>
       <l n="24">‘ Twere rude to make him tell it twice ;</l>
       <l n="25">So bow 'd , was thankful for the honour ;</l>
       <l n="26">And would not fail to wait upon her .</l>
       <l n="27">His beaver brush 'd , his shoes , and gown ,</l>
       <l n="28">Away he trudges into town ;</l>
       <l n="29">Passes the lower castle yard ,</l>
       <l n="30">And now advancing to the guard ,</l>
       <l n="31">He trembles at the thoughts of state ;</l>
       <l n="32">For , conscious of his sheepish gait ,</l>
       <l n="33">His spirits of a sudden fail 'd him ;</l>
       <l n="34">He stopp 'd , and could not tell what ail 'd him .</l>
       <l n="35">What was the message I received ?</l>
       <l n="36">Why certainly the captain raved ?</l>
       <l n="37">To dine with her ! and come at three !</l>
       <l n="38">Impossible ! it can n't be me .</l>
       <l n="39">Or maybe I mistook the word ;</l>
       <l n="40">My lady — it must be my lord .</l>
       <l n="41">My lord ‘ s abroad ; my lady too :</l>
       <l n="42">What must the unhappy doctor do ?</l>
       <l n="43">“ Is Captain Cracherode<span corresp="#note1_99" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>here , pray ? ” — “ No . ”</l>
       <l n="44">“ Nay , then ‘ tis time for me to go . ”</l>
       <l n="45">Am I awake , or do I dream ?</l>
       <l n="46">I 'm sure he call 'd me by my name ;</l>
       <l n="47">Named me as plain as he could speak ;</l>
       <l n="48">And yet there must be some mistake .</l>
       <l n="49">Why , what a jest should I have been ,</l>
       <l n="50">Had now my lady been within !</l>
       <l n="51">What could I 've said ? I 'm mighty glad</l>
       <l n="52">She went abroad — she 'd thought me mad .</l>
       <l n="53">The hour of dining now is past :</l>
       <l n="54">Well then , I 'll e'en go home and fast :</l>
       <l n="55">And , since I ‘ scaped being made a scoff ,</l>
       <l n="56">I think I 'm very fairly off .</l>
       <l n="57">My lady now returning home ,</l>
       <l n="58">Calls “ Cracherode , is the Doctor come ? ”</l>
       <l n="59">He had not heard of him — “ Pray see ,</l>
       <l n="60">‘ Tis now a quarter after three . ”</l>
       <l n="61">The captain walks about , and searches</l>
       <l n="62">Through all the rooms , and courts , and arches ;</l>
       <l n="63">Examines all the servants round ,</l>
       <l n="64">In vain — no doctor 's to be found .</l>
       <l n="65">My lady could not choose but wonder ;</l>
       <l n="66">“ Captain , I fear you 've made some blunder ;</l>
       <l n="67">But , pray , to-morrow go at ten ;</l>
       <l n="68">I 'll try his manners once again ;</l>
       <l n="69">If rudeness be th ’ effect of knowledge ,</l>
       <l n="70">My son shall never see a college . ”</l>
       <l n="71">The captain was a man of reading ,</l>
       <l n="72">And much good sense , as well as breeding ;</l>
       <l n="73">Who , loath to blame , or to incense ,</l>
       <l n="74">Said little in his own defence .</l>
       <l n="75">Next day another message brought ;</l>
       <l n="76">The Doctor , frighten 'd at his fault ,</l>
       <l n="77">Is dress 'd , and stealing through the crowd ,</l>
       <l n="78">Now pale as death , then blush 'd and bow 'd ,</l>
       <l n="79">Panting — and faltering — humm 'd and ha 'd ,</l>
       <l n="80">“ Her ladyship was gone abroad :</l>
       <l n="81">The captain too — he did not know</l>
       <l n="82">Whether he ought to stay or go ; ”</l>
       <l n="83">Begg 'd she 'd forgive him . In conclusion ,</l>
       <l n="84">My lady , pitying his confusion ,</l>
       <l n="85">Call 'd her good nature to relieve him ;</l>
       <l n="86">Told him , she thought she might believe him ;</l>
       <l n="87">And would not only grant his suit ,</l>
       <l n="88">But visit him , and eat some fruit ,</l>
       <l n="89">Provided , at a proper time ,</l>
       <l n="90">He told the real truth in rhyme ;</l>
       <l n="91">‘ Twas to no purpose to oppose ,</l>
       <l n="92">She 'd hear of no excuse in prose .</l>
       <l n="93">The Doctor stood not to debate ,</l>
       <l n="94">Glad to compound at any rate ;</l>
       <l n="95">So , bowing , seemingly complied ;</l>
       <l n="96">Though , if he durst , he had denied .</l>
       <l n="97">But first , resolved to show his taste ,</l>
       <l n="98">Was too refined to give a feast ;</l>
       <l n="99">He 'd treat with nothing that was rare ,</l>
       <l n="100">But winding walks and purer air ;</l>
       <l n="101">Would entertain without expense ,</l>
       <l n="102">Or pride or vain magnificence :</l>
       <l n="103">For well he knew , to such a guest</l>
       <l n="104">The plainest meals must be the best .</l>
       <l n="105">To stomachs clogg 'd with costly fare</l>
       <l n="106">Simplicity alone is rare ;</l>
       <l n="107">While high , and nice , and curious meats</l>
       <l n="108">Are really but vulgar treats .</l>
       <l n="109">Instead of spoils of Persian looms ,</l>
       <l n="110">The costly boast of regal rooms ,</l>
       <l n="111">Thought it more courtly and discreet</l>
       <l n="112">To scatter roses at her feet ;</l>
       <l n="113">Roses of richest dye , that shone</l>
       <l n="114">With native lustre , like her own ;</l>
       <l n="115">Beauty that needs no aid of art</l>
       <l n="116">Through every sense to reach the heart .</l>
       <l n="117">The gracious dame , though well she knew</l>
       <l n="118">All this was much beneath her due ,</l>
       <l n="119">Liked everything — at least thought fit</l>
       <l n="120">To praise it par manière d'acquit .</l>
       <l n="121">Yet she , though seeming pleased , can n't bear</l>
       <l n="122">The scorching sun , or chilling air ;</l>
       <l n="123">Disturb 'd alike at both extremes ,</l>
       <l n="124">Whether he shows or hides his beams :</l>
       <l n="125">Though seeming pleased at all she sees ,</l>
       <l n="126">Starts at the ruffling of the trees ,</l>
       <l n="127">And scarce can speak for want of breath ,</l>
       <l n="128">In half a walk fatigued to death .</l>
       <l n="129">The Doctor takes his hint from hence ,</l>
       <l n="130">T ’ apologize his late offence :</l>
       <l n="131">“ Madam , the mighty power of use</l>
       <l n="132">Now strangely pleads in my excuse ;</l>
       <l n="133">If you unused have scarcely strength</l>
       <l n="134">To gain this walk 's untoward length ;</l>
       <l n="135">If , frighten 'd at a scene so rude ,</l>
       <l n="136">Through long disuse of solitude ;</l>
       <l n="137">If , long confined to fires and screens ,</l>
       <l n="138">You dread the waving of these greens ;</l>
       <l n="139">If you , who long have breathed the fumes</l>
       <l n="140">Of city fogs and crowded rooms ,</l>
       <l n="141">Do now solicitously shun</l>
       <l n="142">The cooler air and dazzling sun ;</l>
       <l n="143">If his majestic eye you flee ,</l>
       <l n="144">Learn hence t ’ excuse and pity me .</l>
       <l n="145">Consider what it is to bear</l>
       <l n="146">The powder 'd courtier 's witty sneer ;</l>
       <l n="147">To see th ’ important man of dress</l>
       <l n="148">Scoffing my college awkwardness ;</l>
       <l n="149">To be the strutting cornet 's sport ,</l>
       <l n="150">To run the gauntlet of the court ,</l>
       <l n="151">Winning my way by slow approaches ,</l>
       <l n="152">Through crowds of coxcombs and of coaches ,</l>
       <l n="153">From the first fierce cockaded sentry ,</l>
       <l n="154">Quite through the tribe of waiting gentry ;</l>
       <l n="155">To pass so many crowded stages ,</l>
       <l n="156">And stand the staring of your pages :</l>
       <l n="157">And after all , to crown my spleen ,</l>
       <l n="158">Be told — ‘ You are not to be seen : ’</l>
       <l n="159">Or , if you are , be forced to bear</l>
       <l n="160">The awe of your majestic air .</l>
       <l n="161">And can I then be faulty found ,</l>
       <l n="162">In dreading this vexatious round ?</l>
       <l n="163">Can it be strange , if I eschew</l>
       <l n="164">A scene so glorious and so new ?</l>
       <l n="165">Or is he criminal that flies</l>
       <l n="166">The living lustre of your eyes ? ”</l>

       <l n="4">Once on a time , a righteous sage ,</l>
       <l n="5">Grieved with the vices of the age ,</l>
       <l n="6">Applied to Jove with fervent prayer —</l>
       <l n="7">“ O Jove , if Virtue be so fair</l>
       <l n="8">As it was deem 'd in former days ,</l>
       <l n="9">By Plato and by Socrates ,</l>
       <l n="10">Whose beauties mortal eyes escape ,</l>

       <l n="12">Make then its real excellence ,</l>
       <l n="13">For once the theme of human sense ;</l>

       <l n="26">Virtue was for this sex design 'd ,</l>
       <l n="27">In mild reproof to womankind ;</l>
       <l n="28">In manly form to let them see</l>
       <l n="29">The loveliness of modesty ,</l>
       <l n="30">The thousand decencies that shone</l>
       <l n="31">With lessen 'd lustre in their own ;</l>

       <l n="97">To Wealth and Vice in high degree :</l>
       <l n="98">Exalted Worth disdains to owe</l>

       <l n="115">Demands him in a higher sphere :[ 3 ]</l>
       <l n="116">Distress of nations calls him hence ,</l>

       <l n="127">And Merit rears her drooping head ;</l>
       <l n="128">The arts revive , the valleys sing ,</l>
       <l n="129">And winter softens into spring :</l>
       <l n="130">The wondering world , where'er he moves ,</l>
       <l n="131">With new delight looks up , and loves ;</l>
       <l n="132">One sex consenting to admire ,</l>
       <l n="133">Nor less the other to desire ;</l>
       <l n="134">While he , though seated on a throne ,</l>
       <l n="135">Confines his love to one alone ;</l>
       <l n="136">The rest condemn 'd with rival voice</l>
       <l n="137">Repining , do applaud his choice .</l>
       <l n="138">Fame now reports , the Western isle</l>
       <l n="139">Is made his mansion for a while ,</l>
       <l n="140">Whose anxious natives , night and day ,</l>
       <l n="141">( Happy beneath his righteous sway ,)</l>
       <l n="142">Weary the gods with ceaseless prayer ,</l>
       <l n="143">To bless him , and to keep him there ;</l>
       <l n="144">And claim it as a debt from Fate ,</l>
       <l n="145">Too lately found , to lose him late .</l>

     <note xml:id="note1_104" place="bottom" n="1">Delany , by the patronage of Carteret , and probably through the intercession of Swift , had obtained a small living in the north of Ireland , worth about one hundred pounds a-year , with the chancellorship of Christ-Church , and a prebend 's stall in St. Patrick 's , neither of which exceeded the same annual amount . Yet a clamour was raised among the Whigs , on account of the multiplication of his preferments ; and a charge was founded against the Lord-Lieutenant of extravagant favour to a Tory divine , which Swift judged worthy of an admirable ironical confutation in his “ Vindication of Lord Carteret . ” It appears , from the following verses , that Delany was far from being of the same opinion with those who thought he was too amply provided for .— Scott .

      <head>A LIBEL ON THE REVEREND DR. DELANY , AND HIS EXCELLENCY JOHN , LORD CARTERET 1729</head>
       <l n="1">Deluded mortals , whom the great</l>
       <l n="2">Choose for companions tête-à-tête ;</l>
       <l n="3">Who at their dinners , en famille ,</l>
       <l n="4">Get leave to sit whene'er you will ;</l>
       <l n="5">Then boasting tell us where you dined ,</l>
       <l n="6">And how his lordship was so kind ;</l>
       <l n="7">How many pleasant things he spoke ;</l>
       <l n="8">And how you laugh 'd at every joke :</l>
       <l n="9">Swear he 's a most facetious man ;</l>
       <l n="10">That you and he are cup and can ;</l>
       <l n="11">You travel with a heavy load ,</l>
       <l n="12">And quite mistake preferment 's road .</l>
       <l n="13">Suppose my lord and you alone ;</l>
       <l n="14">Hint the least interest of your own ,</l>
       <l n="15">His visage drops , he knits his brow ,</l>
       <l n="16">He cannot talk of business now :</l>
       <l n="17">Or , mention but a vacant post ,</l>
       <l n="18">He 'll turn it off with “ Name your toast : ”</l>
       <l n="19">Nor could the nicest artist paint</l>
       <l n="20">A countenance with more constraint .</l>
       <l n="21">For , as their appetites to quench ,</l>
       <l n="22">Lords keep a pimp to bring a wench ;</l>
       <l n="23">So men of wit are but a kind</l>
       <l n="24">Of panders to a vicious mind</l>
       <l n="25">Who proper objects must provide</l>
       <l n="26">To gratify their lust of pride ,</l>
       <l n="27">When , wearied with intrigues of state ,</l>
       <l n="28">They find an idle hour to prate .</l>
       <l n="29">Then , shall you dare to ask a place ,</l>
       <l n="30">You forfeit all your patron 's grace ,</l>
       <l n="31">And disappoint the sole design ,</l>
       <l n="32">For which he summon 'd you to dine .</l>
       <l n="33">Thus Congreve spent in writing plays ,</l>
       <l n="34">And one poor office , half his days :</l>
       <l n="35">While Montague ,<span corresp="#note1_103" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>who claim 'd the station</l>
       <l n="36">To be Mæcenas of the nation ,</l>
       <l n="37">For poets open table kept ,</l>
       <l n="38">But ne'er consider 'd where they slept :</l>
       <l n="39">Himself as rich as fifty Jews ,</l>
       <l n="40">Was easy , though they wanted shoes ;</l>
       <l n="41">And crazy Congreve scarce could spare</l>
       <l n="42">A shilling to discharge his chair :</l>
       <l n="43">Till prudence taught him to appeal</l>
       <l n="44">From Pæan 's fire to party zeal ;</l>
       <l n="45">Not owing to his happy vein</l>
       <l n="46">The fortunes of his later scene ,</l>
       <l n="47">Took proper principles to thrive :</l>
       <l n="48">And so might every dunce alive .<span corresp="#note2_63" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span></l>
       <l n="49">Thus Steele , who own 'd what others writ ,</l>
       <l n="50">And flourish 'd by imputed wit ,</l>
       <l n="51">From perils of a hundred jails ,</l>
       <l n="52">Withdrew to starve , and die in Wales .</l>
       <l n="53">Thus Gay , the hare with many friends ,</l>
       <l n="54">Twice seven long years the court attends :</l>
       <l n="55">Who , under tales conveying truth ,</l>
       <l n="56">To virtue form 'd a princely youth :[ 3 ]</l>
       <l n="57">Who paid his courtship with the crowd ,</l>
       <l n="58">As far as modest pride allow 'd ;</l>
       <l n="59">Rejects a servile usher 's place ,</l>
       <l n="60">And leaves St. James 's in disgrace .<span corresp="#note4_31" type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span></l>
       <l n="61">Thus Addison , by lords carest ,</l>
       <l n="62">Was left in foreign lands distrest ;</l>
       <l n="63">Forgot at home , became for hire</l>
       <l n="64">A travelling tutor to a squire :</l>
       <l n="65">But wisely left the Muses ’ hill ,</l>
       <l n="66">To business shaped the poet 's quill ,</l>
       <l n="67">Let all his barren laurels fade ,</l>
       <l n="68">Took up himself the courtier 's trade ,</l>
       <l n="69">And , grown a minister of state ,</l>
       <l n="70">Saw poets at his levee wait .<span corresp="#note5_28" type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span></l>
       <l n="71">Hail , happy Pope ! whose generous mind</l>
       <l n="72">Detesting all the statesman kind ,</l>
       <l n="73">Contemning courts , at courts unseen ,</l>
       <l n="74">Refused the visits of a queen .</l>
       <l n="75">A soul with every virtue fraught ,</l>
       <l n="76">By sages , priests , or poets taught ;</l>
       <l n="77">Whose filial piety excels</l>
       <l n="78">Whatever Grecian story tells ;<span corresp="#note6_18" type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span></l>
       <l n="79">A genius for all stations fit ,</l>
       <l n="80">Whose meanest talent is his wit :</l>
       <l n="81">His heart too great , though fortune little ,</l>
       <l n="82">To lick a rascal statesman 's spittle :</l>
       <l n="83">Appealing to the nation 's taste ,</l>
       <l n="84">Above the reach of want is placed :</l>
       <l n="85">By Homer dead was taught to thrive ,</l>
       <l n="86">Which Homer never could alive ;</l>
       <l n="87">And sits aloft on Pindus ’ head ,</l>
       <l n="88">Despising slaves that cringe for bread .</l>
       <l n="89">True politicians only pay</l>
       <l n="90">For solid work , but not for play :</l>
       <l n="91">Nor ever choose to work with tools</l>
       <l n="92">Forged up in colleges and schools ,</l>
       <l n="93">Consider how much more is due</l>
       <l n="94">To all their journeymen than you :</l>
       <l n="95">At table you can Horace quote ;</l>
       <l n="96">They at a pinch can bribe a vote :</l>
       <l n="97">You show your skill in Grecian story ;</l>
       <l n="98">But they can manage Whig and Tory ;</l>
       <l n="99">You , as a critic , are so curious</l>
       <l n="100">To find a verse in Virgil spurious ;</l>
       <l n="101">But they can smoke the deep designs ,</l>
       <l n="102">When Bolingbroke with Pulteney dines .</l>
       <l n="103">Besides , your patron may upbraid ye ,</l>
       <l n="104">That you have got a place already ;</l>
       <l n="105">An office for your talents fit ,</l>
       <l n="106">To flatter , carve , and show your wit ;</l>
       <l n="107">To snuff the lights and stir the fire ,</l>
       <l n="108">And get a dinner for your hire .</l>
       <l n="109">What claim have you to place or pension ?</l>
       <l n="110">He overpays in condescension .</l>
       <l n="111">But , reverend doctor , you we know</l>
       <l n="112">Could never condescend so low ;</l>
       <l n="113">The viceroy , whom you now attend ,</l>
       <l n="114">Would , if he durst , be more your friend ;</l>
       <l n="115">Nor will in you those gifts despise ,</l>
       <l n="116">By which himself was taught to rise :</l>
       <l n="117">When he has virtue to retire ,</l>
       <l n="118">He 'll grieve he did not raise you higher ,</l>
       <l n="119">And place you in a better station ,</l>
       <l n="120">Although it might have pleased the nation .</l>
       <l n="121">This may be true — submitting still</l>
       <l n="122">To Walpole 's more than royal will ;</l>
       <l n="123">And what condition can be worse ?</l>
       <l n="124">He comes to drain a beggar 's purse ;</l>
       <l n="125">He comes to tie our chains on faster ,</l>
       <l n="126">And show us England is our master :</l>
       <l n="127">Caressing knaves , and dunces wooing ,</l>
       <l n="128">To make them work their own undoing .</l>
       <l n="129">What has he else to bait his traps ,</l>
       <l n="130">Or bring his vermin in , but scraps ?</l>
       <l n="131">The offals of a church distrest ;</l>
       <l n="132">A hungry vicarage at best ;</l>
       <l n="133">Or some remote inferior post ,</l>
       <l n="134">With forty pounds a-year at most ?</l>
       <l n="135">But here again you interpose —</l>
       <l n="136">Your favourite lord is none of those</l>
       <l n="137">Who owe their virtues to their stations ,</l>
       <l n="138">And characters to dedications :</l>
       <l n="139">For , keep him in , or turn him out ,</l>
       <l n="140">His learning none will call in doubt ;</l>
       <l n="141">His learning , though a poet said it</l>
       <l n="142">Before a play , would lose no credit ;</l>
       <l n="143">Nor Pope would dare deny him wit ,</l>
       <l n="144">Although to praise it Philips writ .</l>
       <l n="145">I own he hates an action base ,</l>
       <l n="146">His virtues battling with his place :</l>
       <l n="147">Nor wants a nice discerning spirit</l>
       <l n="148">Betwixt a true and spurious merit ;</l>
       <l n="149">Can sometimes drop a voter 's claim ,</l>
       <l n="150">And give up party to his fame .</l>
       <l n="151">I do the most that friendship can ;</l>
       <l n="152">I hate the viceroy , love the man .</l>
       <l n="153">But you , who , till your fortune 's made ,</l>
       <l n="154">Must be a sweetener by your trade ,</l>
       <l n="155">Should swear he never meant us ill ;</l>
       <l n="156">We suffer sore against his will ;</l>
       <l n="157">That , if we could but see his heart ,</l>
       <l n="158">He would have chose a milder part :</l>
       <l n="159">We rather should lament his case ,</l>
       <l n="160">Who must obey , or lose his place .</l>
       <l n="161">Since this reflection slipt your pen ,</l>
       <l n="162">Insert it when you write again ;</l>
       <l n="163">And , to illustrate it , produce</l>
       <l n="164">This simile for his excuse :</l>
       <l n="165">“ So , to destroy a guilty land</l>
       <l n="166">An<span corresp="#note7_13" type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>angel sent by Heaven 's command ,</l>
       <l n="167">While he obeys Almighty will ,</l>
       <l n="168">Perhaps may feel compassion still ;</l>
       <l n="169">And wish the task had been assign 'd</l>
       <l n="170">To spirits of less gentle kind . ”</l>
       <l n="171">But I , in politics grown old ,</l>
       <l n="172">Whose thoughts are of a different mould ,</l>
       <l n="173">Who from my soul sincerely hate</l>
       <l n="174">Both kings and ministers of state ;</l>
       <l n="175">Who look on courts with stricter eyes</l>
       <l n="176">To see the seeds of vice arise ;</l>
       <l n="177">Can lend you an allusion fitter ,</l>
       <l n="178">Though flattering knaves may call it bitter ;</l>
       <l n="179">Which , if you durst but give it place ,</l>
       <l n="180">Would show you many a statesman 's face :</l>
       <l n="181">Fresh from the tripod of Apollo ,</l>
       <l n="182">I had it in the words that follow :</l>
       <l n="183">Take notice to avoid offence ,</l>
       <l n="184">I here except his excellence :</l>
       <l n="185">“ So , to effect his monarch 's ends ,</l>
       <l n="186">From hell a viceroy devil ascends ;</l>
       <l n="187">His budget with corruptions cramm 'd ,</l>
       <l n="188">The contributions of the damn 'd ;</l>
       <l n="189">Which with unsparing hand he strews</l>
       <l n="190">Through courts and senates as he goes ;</l>
       <l n="191">And then at Beelzebub 's black hall ,</l>
       <l n="192">Complains his budget was too small . ”</l>
       <l n="193">Your simile may better shine</l>
       <l n="194">In verse , but there is truth in mine .</l>
       <l n="195">For no imaginable things</l>
       <l n="196">Can differ more than gods and kings :</l>
       <l n="197">And statesmen , by ten thousand odds ,</l>
       <l n="198">Are angels just as kings are gods .</l>

       <p>— Tanti tibi non sit opaci Omnis arena Tagi quodque in mare volvitur aurum .— Juv . iii , 54 .</p>
      </epigraph>
      <docImprint>As some raw youth in country bred , To arms by thirst of honour led , When at a skirmish first he hears The bullets whistling round his ears , Will duck his head aside , will start , And feel a trembling at his heart , Till ‘ scaping oft without a wound Lessens the terror of the sound ; Fly bullets now as thick as hops , He runs into a cannon 's chops . An author thus , who pants for fame , Begins the world with fear and shame ; When first in print you see him dread Each pop-gun levell 'd at his head : The lead yon critic 's quill contains , Is destined to beat out his brains : As if he heard loud thunders roll , Cries , Lord have mercy on his soul ! Concluding that another shot Will strike him dead upon the spot . But , when with squibbing , flashing , popping , He cannot see one creature dropping ; That , missing fire , or missing aim , His life is safe , I mean his fame ; The danger past , takes heart of grace , And looks a critic in the face . Though splendour gives the fairest mark To poison 'd arrows in the dark , Yet , in yourself when smooth and round , They glance aside without a wound . ‘ Tis said , the gods tried all their art , How pain they might from pleasure part : But little could their strength avail ; Both still are fasten 'd by the tail ; Thus fame and censure with a tether By fate are always link 'd together . Why will you aim to be preferr 'd In wit before the common herd ; And yet grow mortified and vex 'd , To pay the penalty annex 'd ? ‘ Tis eminence makes envy rise ; As fairest fruits attract the flies . Should stupid libels grieve your mind , You soon a remedy may find ; Lie down obscure like other folks Below the lash of snarlers ’ jokes . Their faction is five hundred odds , For every coxcomb lends them rods , And sneers as learnedly as they , Like females o'er their morning tea . You say the Muse will not contain And write you must , or break a vein . Then , if you find the terms too hard , No longer my advice regard : But raise your fancy on the wing ; The Irish senate 's praises sing ; How jealous of the nation 's freedom , And for corruptions how they weed ‘ em ; How each the public good pursues , How far their hearts from private views ; Make all true patriots , up to shoe-boys , Huzza their brethren at the Blue-boys ;<span corresp="#note1_104" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Thus grown a member of the club , No longer dread the rage of Grub . How oft am I for rhyme to seek ! To dress a thought I toil a week : And then how thankful to the town , If all my pains will earn a crown ! While every critic can devour My work and me in half an hour . Would men of genius cease to write , The rogues must die for want and spite ; Must die for want of food and raiment , If scandal did not find them payment . How cheerfully the hawkers cry A satire , and the gentry buy ! While my hard-labour 'd poem pines Unsold upon the printer 's lines . A genius in the reverend gown Must ever keep its owner down ; ‘ Tis an unnatural conjunction , And spoils the credit of the function . Round all your brethren cast your eyes , Point out the surest men to rise ; That club of candidates in black , The least deserving of the pack , Aspiring , factious , fierce , and loud , With grace and learning unendow 'd , Can turn their hands to every job , The fittest tools to work for Bob ;<span corresp="#note2_64" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Will sooner coin a thousand lies , Than suffer men of parts to rise ; They crowd about preferment 's gate , And press you down with all their weight ; For as of old mathematicians Were by the vulgar thought magicians ; So academic dull ale-drinkers Pronounce all men of wit free-thinkers . Wit , as the chief of virtue 's friends , Disdains to serve ignoble ends . Observe what loads of stupid rhymes Oppress us in corrupted times ; What pamphlets in a court 's defence Show reason , grammar , truth , or sense ? For though the Muse delights in fiction , She ne'er inspires against conviction . Then keep your virtue still unmixt , And let not faction come betwixt : By party-steps no grandeur climb at , Though it would make you<country>England</country>'s primate ; First learn the science to be dull , You then may soon your conscience lull ; If not , however seated high , Your genius in your face will fly . When Jove was from his teeming head Of Wit 's fair goddess<span corresp="#note3_45" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>brought to bed , There follow 'd at his lying-in For after-birth a sooterkin ; Which , as the nurse pursued to kill , Attain 'd by flight the Muses ’ hill , There in the soil began to root , And litter 'd at Parnassus ’ foot . From hence the critic vermin sprung , With harpy claws and poisonous tongue : Who fatten on poetic scraps , Too cunning to be caught in traps . Dame Nature , as the learned show , Provides each animal its foe : Hounds hunt the hare , the wily fox Devours your geese , the wolf your flocks Thus Envy pleads a natural claim To persecute the Muse 's fame ; On poets in all times abusive , From Homer down to Pope inclusive . Yet what avails it to complain ? You try to take revenge in vain . A rat your utmost rage defies , That safe behind the wainscot lies . Say , did you ever know by sight In cheese an individual mite ! Show me the same numeric flea , That bit your neck but yesterday : You then may boldly go in quest To find the Grub Street poet 's nest ; What spunging-house , in dread of jail , Receives them , while they wait for bail ; What alley are they nestled in , To flourish o'er a cup of gin ; Find the last garret where they lay , Or cellar where they starve to-day . Suppose you have them all trepann 'd , With each a libel in his hand , What punishment would you inflict ? Or call them rogues , or get them kickt ? These they have often tried before ; You but oblige them so much more : Themselves would be the first to tell , To make their trash the better sell . You have been libell 'd — Let us know , What fool officious told you so ? Will you regard the hawker 's cries , Who in his titles always lies ? Whate'er the noisy scoundrel says , It might be something in your praise ; And praise bestow 'd in Grub Street rhymes , Would vex one more a thousand times . Till critics blame , and judges praise , The poet cannot claim his bays . On me when dunces are satiric , I take it for a panegyric . Hated by fools , and fools to hate , Be that my motto , and my fate .

      <head>DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING A BIRTH-DAY SONG . 1729</head>
       <l n="1">To form a just and finish 'd piece ,</l>
       <l n="2">Take twenty gods of Rome or Greece ,</l>
       <l n="3">Whose godships are in chief request ,</l>
       <l n="4">And fit your present subject best ;</l>
       <l n="5">And , should it be your hero 's case ,</l>
       <l n="6">To have both male and female race ,</l>
       <l n="7">Your business must be to provide</l>
       <l n="8">A score of goddesses beside .</l>
       <l n="9">Some call their monarchs sons of Saturn ,</l>
       <l n="10">For which they bring a modern pattern ;</l>
       <l n="11">Because they might have heard of one ,<span corresp="#note1_105" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></l>
       <l n="12">Who often long 'd to eat his son ;</l>
       <l n="13">But this I think will not go down ,</l>
       <l n="14">For here the father kept his crown .</l>
       <l n="15">Why , then , appoint him son of Jove ,</l>
       <l n="16">Who met his mother in a grove ;</l>
       <l n="17">To this we freely shall consent ,</l>
       <l n="18">Well knowing what the poets meant ;</l>
       <l n="19">And in their sense , ‘ twixt me and you ,</l>
       <l n="20">It may be literally true .<span corresp="#note2_65" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span></l>
       <l n="21">Next , as the laws of verse require ,</l>
       <l n="22">He must be greater than his sire ;</l>
       <l n="23">For Jove , as every schoolboy knows ,</l>
       <l n="24">Was able Saturn to depose ;</l>
       <l n="25">And sure no Christian poet breathing</l>
       <l n="26">Would be more scrupulous than a Heathen ;</l>
       <l n="27">Or , if to blasphemy it tends .</l>
       <l n="28">That 's but a trifle among friends .</l>
       <l n="29">Your hero now another Mars is ,</l>
       <l n="30">Makes mighty armies turn their a — s :</l>
       <l n="31">Behold his glittering falchion mow</l>
       <l n="32">Whole squadrons at a single blow ;</l>
       <l n="33">While Victory , with wings outspread ,</l>
       <l n="34">Flies , like an eagle , o'er his head ;</l>
       <l n="35">His milk-white steed upon its haunches ,</l>
       <l n="36">Or pawing into dead men 's paunches ;</l>
       <l n="37">As Overton has drawn his sire ,</l>
       <l n="38">Still seen o'er many an alehouse fire .</l>
       <l n="39">Then from his arm hoarse thunder rolls ,</l>
       <l n="40">As loud as fifty mustard bowls ;</l>
       <l n="41">For thunder still his arm supplies ,</l>
       <l n="42">And lightning always in his eyes .</l>
       <l n="43">They both are cheap enough in conscience ,</l>
       <l n="44">And serve to echo rattling nonsense .</l>
       <l n="45">The rumbling words march fierce along ,</l>
       <l n="46">Made trebly dreadful in your song .</l>
       <l n="47">Sweet poet , hired for birth-day rhymes ,</l>
       <l n="48">To sing of wars , choose peaceful times .</l>
       <l n="49">What though , for fifteen years and more ,</l>
       <l n="50">Janus has lock 'd his temple-door ;</l>
       <l n="51">Though not a coffeehouse we read in</l>
       <l n="52">Has mention 'd arms on this side Sweden ;</l>
       <l n="53">Nor London Journals , nor the Postmen ,</l>
       <l n="54">Though fond of warlike lies as most men ;</l>
       <l n="55">Thou still with battles stuff thy head full :</l>
       <l n="56">For , must thy hero not be dreadful ?</l>
       <l n="57">Dismissing Mars , it next must follow</l>
       <l n="58">Your conqueror is become Apollo :</l>
       <l n="59">That he 's Apollo is as plain as</l>
       <l n="60">That Robin Walpole is Mæcenas ;</l>
       <l n="61">But that he struts , and that he squints ,</l>
       <l n="62">You 'd know him by Apollo 's prints .</l>
       <l n="63">Old Phoebus is but half as bright ,</l>
       <l n="64">For yours can shine both day and night .</l>
       <l n="65">The first , perhaps , may once an age</l>
       <l n="66">Inspire you with poetic rage ;</l>
       <l n="67">Your Phoebus Royal , every day ,</l>
       <l n="68">Not only can inspire , but pay .</l>
       <l n="69">Then make this new Apollo sit</l>
       <l n="70">Sole patron , judge , and god of wit .</l>
       <l n="71">“ How from his altitude he stoops</l>
       <l n="72">To raise up Virtue when she droops ;</l>
       <l n="73">On Learning how his bounty flows ,</l>
       <l n="74">And with what justice he bestows ;</l>
       <l n="75">Fair Isis , and ye banks of Cam !</l>
       <l n="76">Be witness if I tell a flam ,</l>
       <l n="77">What prodigies in arts we drain ,</l>
       <l n="78">From both your streams , in George 's reign .</l>
       <l n="79">As from the flowery bed of Nile ” —</l>
       <l n="80">But here 's enough to show your style .</l>
       <l n="81">Broad innuendoes , such as this ,</l>
       <l n="82">If well applied , can hardly miss :</l>
       <l n="83">For , when you bring your song in print ,</l>
       <l n="84">He 'll get it read , and take the hint ;</l>
       <l n="85">( It must be read before ‘ tis warbled ,</l>
       <l n="86">The paper gilt and cover marbled . )</l>
       <l n="87">And will be so much more your debtor ,</l>
       <l n="88">Because he never knew a letter .</l>
       <l n="89">And , as he hears his wit and sense</l>
       <l n="90">( To which he never made pretence )</l>
       <l n="91">Set out in hyperbolic strains ,</l>
       <l n="92">A guinea shall reward your pains ;</l>
       <l n="93">For patrons never pay so well ,</l>
       <l n="94">As when they scarce have learn 'd to spell .</l>
       <l n="95">Next call him Neptune : with his trident</l>
       <l n="96">He rules the sea : you see him ride i n't ;</l>
       <l n="97">And , if provoked , he soundly firks his</l>
       <l n="98">Rebellious waves with rods , like Xerxes .</l>
       <l n="99">He would have seized the Spanish plate ,</l>
       <l n="100">Had not the fleet gone out too late ;</l>
       <l n="101">And in their very ports besiege them ,</l>
       <l n="102">But that he would not disoblige them ;</l>
       <l n="103">And make the rascals pay him dearly</l>
       <l n="104">For those affronts they give him yearly .</l>
       <l n="105">‘ Tis not denied , that , when we write ,</l>
       <l n="106">Our ink is black , our paper white :</l>
       <l n="107">And , when we scrawl our paper o'er ,</l>
       <l n="108">We blacken what was white before :</l>
       <l n="109">I think this practice only fit</l>
       <l n="110">For dealers in satiric wit .</l>
       <l n="111">But you some white-lead ink must get</l>
       <l n="112">And write on paper black as jet ;</l>
       <l n="113">Your interest lies to learn the knack</l>
       <l n="114">Of whitening what before was black .</l>
       <l n="115">Thus your encomium , to be strong ,</l>
       <l n="116">Must be applied directly wrong .</l>
       <l n="117">A tyrant for his mercy praise ,</l>
       <l n="118">And crown a royal dunce with bays :</l>
       <l n="119">A squinting monkey load with charms ,</l>
       <l n="120">And paint a coward fierce in arms .</l>
       <l n="121">Is he to avarice inclined ?</l>
       <l n="122">Extol him for his generous mind :</l>
       <l n="123">And , when we starve for want of corn ,</l>
       <l n="124">Come out with Amalthea 's horn :[ 3 ]</l>
       <l n="125">For all experience this evinces</l>
       <l n="126">The only art of pleasing princes :</l>
       <l n="127">For princes ’ love you should descant</l>
       <l n="128">On virtues which they know they want .</l>
       <l n="129">One compliment I had forgot ,</l>
       <l n="130">But songsters must omit it not ;</l>
       <l n="131">I freely grant the thought is old :</l>
       <l n="132">Why , then , your hero must be told ,</l>
       <l n="133">In him such virtues lie inherent ,</l>
       <l n="134">To qualify him God 's vicegerent ;</l>
       <l n="135">That with no title to inherit ,</l>
       <l n="136">He must have been a king by merit .</l>
       <l n="137">Yet , be the fancy old or new ,</l>
       <l n="138">Tis partly false , and partly true :</l>
       <l n="139">And , take it right , it means no more</l>
       <l n="140">Than George and William claim 'd before .</l>
       <l n="141">Should some obscure inferior fellow ,</l>
       <l n="142">Like Julius , or the youth of Pella ,<span corresp="#note4_32" type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span></l>
       <l n="143">When all your list of Gods is out ,</l>
       <l n="144">Presume to show his mortal snout ,</l>
       <l n="145">And as a Deity intrude ,</l>
       <l n="146">Because he had the world subdued ;</l>
       <l n="147">O , let him not debase your thoughts ,</l>
       <l n="148">Or name him but to tell his faults .—</l>
       <l n="149">Of Gods I only quote the best ,</l>
       <l n="150">But you may hook in all the rest .</l>
       <l n="151">Now , birth-day bard , with joy proceed</l>
       <l n="152">To praise your empress and her breed ;</l>
       <l n="153">First of the first , to vouch your lies ,</l>
       <l n="154">Bring all the females of the skies ;</l>
       <l n="155">The Graces , and their mistress , Venus ,</l>
       <l n="156">Must venture down to entertain us :</l>
       <l n="157">With bended knees when they adore her ,</l>
       <l n="158">What dowdies they appear before her !</l>
       <l n="159">Nor shall we think you talk at random ,</l>
       <l n="160">For Venus might be her great-grandam :</l>
       <l n="161">Six thousand years has lived the Goddess ,</l>
       <l n="162">Your heroine hardly fifty odd is ;</l>
       <l n="163">Besides , your songsters oft have shown</l>
       <l n="164">That she has Graces of her own :</l>
       <l n="165">Three Graces by Lucina brought her ,</l>
       <l n="166">Just three , and every Grace a daughter ;</l>
       <l n="167">Here many a king his heart and crown</l>
       <l n="168">Shall at their snowy feet lay down :</l>
       <l n="169">In royal robes , they come by dozens</l>
       <l n="170">To court their English German cousins :</l>
       <l n="171">Beside a pair of princely babies ,</l>
       <l n="172">That , five years hence , will both be Hebes .</l>
       <l n="173">Now see her seated in her throne</l>
       <l n="174">With genuine lustre , all her own :</l>
       <l n="175">Poor Cynthia never shone so bright ,</l>
       <l n="176">Her splendour is but borrow 'd light ;</l>
       <l n="177">And only with her brother linkt</l>
       <l n="178">Can shine , without him is extinct .</l>
       <l n="179">But Carolina shines the clearer</l>
       <l n="180">With neither spouse nor brother near her :</l>
       <l n="181">And darts her beams o'er both our isles ,</l>
       <l n="182">Though George is gone a thousand miles .</l>
       <l n="183">Thus Berecynthia takes her place ,</l>
       <l n="184">Attended by her heavenly race ;</l>
       <l n="185">And sees a son in every God ,</l>
       <l n="186">Unawed by Jove 's all-shaking nod .</l>
       <l n="187">Now sing his little highness Freddy</l>
       <l n="188">Who struts like any king already :</l>
       <l n="189">With so much beauty , show me any maid</l>
       <l n="190">That could resist this charming Ganymede !</l>
       <l n="191">Where majesty with sweetness vies ,</l>
       <l n="192">And , like his father , early wise .</l>
       <l n="193">Then cut him out a world of work ,</l>
       <l n="194">To conquer Spain , and quell the Turk :</l>
       <l n="195">Foretel his empire crown 'd with bays ,</l>
       <l n="196">And golden times , and halcyon days ;</l>
       <l n="197">And swear his line shall rule the nation</l>
       <l n="198">For ever — till the conflagration .</l>
       <l n="199">But , now it comes into my mind ,</l>
       <l n="200">We left a little duke behind ;</l>
       <l n="201">A Cupid in his face and size ,</l>
       <l n="202">And only wants , to want his eyes .</l>
       <l n="203">Make some provision for the younker ,</l>
       <l n="204">Find him a kingdom out to conquer ;</l>
       <l n="205">Prepare a fleet to waft him o'er ,</l>
       <l n="206">Make Gulliver his commodore ;</l>
       <l n="207">Into whose pocket valiant Willy put ,</l>
       <l n="208">Will soon subdue the realm of Lilliput .</l>
       <l n="209">A skilful critic justly blames</l>
       <l n="210">Hard , tough , crank , guttural , harsh , stiff names</l>
       <l n="211">The sense can ne'er be too jejune ,</l>
       <l n="212">But smooth your words to fit the tune .</l>
       <l n="213">Hanover may do well enough ,</l>
       <l n="214">But George and Brunswick are too rough ;</l>
       <l n="215">Hesse-Darmstadt makes a rugged sound ,</l>
       <l n="216">And Guelp the strongest ear will wound .</l>
       <l n="217">In vain are all attempts from Germany</l>
       <l n="218">To find out proper words for harmony :</l>
       <l n="219">And yet I must except the Rhine ,</l>
       <l n="220">Because it clinks to Caroline .</l>
       <l n="221">Hail , queen of Britain , queen of rhymes !</l>
       <l n="222">Be sung ten hundred thousand times ;</l>
       <l n="223">Too happy were the poets ’ crew ,</l>
       <l n="224">If their own happiness they knew :</l>
       <l n="225">Three syllables did never meet</l>
       <l n="226">So soft , so sliding , and so sweet :</l>
       <l n="227">Nine other tuneful words like that</l>
       <l n="228">Would prove even Homer 's numbers flat .</l>
       <l n="229">Behold three beauteous vowels stand ,</l>
       <l n="230">With bridegroom liquids hand in hand ;</l>
       <l n="231">In concord here for ever fix 'd ,</l>
       <l n="232">No jarring consonant betwixt .</l>
       <l n="233">May Caroline continue long ,</l>
       <l n="234">For ever fair and young !— in song .</l>
       <l n="235">What though the royal carcass must ,</l>
       <l n="236">Squeezed in a coffin , turn to dust ?</l>
       <l n="237">Those elements her name compose ,</l>
       <l n="238">Like atoms , are exempt from blows .</l>
       <l n="239">Though Caroline may fill your gaps ,</l>
       <l n="240">Yet still you must consult your maps ;</l>
       <l n="241">Find rivers with harmonious names ,</l>
       <l n="242">Sabrina , Medway , and the Thames ,</l>
       <l n="243">Britannia long will wear like steel ,</l>
       <l n="244">But Albion 's cliffs are out at heel ;</l>
       <l n="245">And Patience can endure no more</l>
       <l n="246">To hear the Belgic lion roar .</l>
       <l n="247">Give up the phrase of haughty Gaul ,</l>
       <l n="248">But proud Iberia soundly maul :</l>
       <l n="249">Restore the ships by Philip taken ,</l>

       <l n="5">A peacock reign 'd , whose glorious sway</l>
       <l n="6">His subjects with delight obey :</l>
       <l n="7">His tail was beauteous to behold ,</l>
       <l n="8">Replete with goodly eyes and gold ;</l>
       <l n="9">Fair emblem of that monarch 's guise ,</l>
       <l n="10">Whose train at once is rich and wise ;</l>
       <l n="11">And princely ruled he many regions ,</l>
       <l n="12">And statesmen wise , and valiant legions .</l>
       <l n="13">A pheasant lord ,<span corresp="#note1_106" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>above the rest ,</l>
       <l n="14">With every grace and talent blest ,</l>
       <l n="15">Was sent to sway , with all his skill ,</l>
       <l n="16">The sceptre of a neighbouring hill .<span corresp="#note2_66" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span></l>
       <l n="17">No science was to him unknown ,</l>
       <l n="18">For all the arts were all his own :</l>
       <l n="19">In all the living learned read ,</l>
       <l n="20">Though more delighted with the dead :</l>
       <l n="21">For birds , if ancient tales say true ,</l>
       <l n="22">Had then their Popes and Homers too ;</l>
       <l n="23">Could read and write in prose and verse ,</l>
       <l n="24">And speak like ***, and build like Pearce .<span corresp="#note3_46" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span></l>
       <l n="25">He knew their voices , and their wings ,</l>
       <l n="26">Who smoothest soars , who sweetest sings ;</l>
       <l n="27">Who toils with ill-fledged pens to climb ,</l>
       <l n="28">And who attain 'd the true sublime .</l>
       <l n="29">Their merits he could well descry ,</l>
       <l n="30">He had so exquisite an eye ;</l>
       <l n="31">And when that fail 'd to show them clear ,</l>
       <l n="32">He had as exquisite an ear ;</l>
       <l n="33">It chanced as on a day he stray 'd</l>
       <l n="34">Beneath an academic shade ,</l>
       <l n="35">He liked , amidst a thousand throats ,</l>
       <l n="36">The wildness of a Woodlark 's<span corresp="#note4_33" type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>notes ,</l>
       <l n="37">And search 'd , and spied , and seized his game ,</l>
       <l n="38">And took him home , and made him tame ;</l>
       <l n="39">Found him on trial true and able ,</l>
       <l n="40">So cheer 'd and fed him at his table .</l>
       <l n="41">Here some shrewd critic finds I 'm caught ,</l>
       <l n="42">And cries out , “ Better fed than taught ” — Then</l>
       <l n="43">jests on game and tame , and reads ,</l>
       <l n="44">And jests , and so my tale proceeds .</l>
       <l n="45">Long had he studied in the wood ,</l>
       <l n="46">Conversing with the wise and good :</l>
       <l n="47">His soul with harmony inspired ,</l>
       <l n="48">With love of truth and virtue fired :</l>
       <l n="49">His brethren 's good and Maker 's praise</l>
       <l n="50">Were all the study of his lays ;</l>
       <l n="51">Were all his study in retreat ,</l>
       <l n="52">And now employ 'd him with the great .</l>
       <l n="53">His friendship was the sure resort</l>
       <l n="54">Of all the wretched at the court ;</l>
       <l n="55">But chiefly merit in distress</l>
       <l n="56">His greatest blessing was to bless .—</l>
       <l n="57">This fix 'd him in his patron 's breast ,</l>
       <l n="58">But fired with envy all the rest :</l>
       <l n="59">I mean that noisy , craving crew ,</l>
       <l n="60">Who round the court incessant flew ,</l>
       <l n="61">And prey 'd like rooks , by pairs and dozens ,</l>
       <l n="62">To fill the maws of sons and cousins :</l>
       <l n="63">“ Unmoved their heart , and chill 'd their blood</l>
       <l n="64">To every thought of common good ,</l>
       <l n="65">Confining every hope and care ,</l>
       <l n="66">To their own low , contracted sphere . ”</l>
       <l n="67">These ran him down with ceaseless cry ,</l>
       <l n="68">But found it hard to tell you why ,</l>
       <l n="69">Till his own worth and wit supplied</l>
       <l n="70">Sufficient matter to deride :</l>
       <l n="71">“ ‘ Tis envy 's safest , surest rule ,</l>
       <l n="72">To hide her rage in ridicule :</l>
       <l n="73">The vulgar eye she best beguiles ,</l>
       <l n="74">When all her snakes are deck 'd with smiles :</l>
       <l n="75">Sardonic smiles , by rancour raised !</l>
       <l n="76">Tormented most when seeming pleased ! ”</l>
       <l n="77">Their spite had more than half expired ,</l>
       <l n="78">Had he not wrote what all admired ;</l>
       <l n="79">What morsels had their malice wanted ,</l>
       <l n="80">But that he built , and plann 'd , and planted !</l>
       <l n="81">How had his sense and learning grieved them ,</l>
       <l n="82">But that his charity relieved them !</l>
       <l n="83">“ At highest worth dull malice reaches ,</l>
       <l n="84">As slugs pollute the fairest peaches :</l>
       <l n="85">Envy defames , as harpies vile</l>
       <l n="86">Devour the food they first defile . ”</l>
       <l n="87">Now ask the fruit of all his favour —</l>
       <l n="88">“ He was not hitherto a saver . ” —</l>
       <l n="89">What then could make their rage run mad ?</l>
       <l n="90">“ Why , what he hoped , not what he had . ”</l>
       <l n="91">“ What tyrant e'er invented ropes ,</l>
       <l n="92">Or racks , or rods , to punish hopes ?</l>
       <l n="93">Th ’ inheritance of hope and fame</l>
       <l n="94">Is seldom Earthly Wisdom 's aim ;</l>
       <l n="95">Or , if it were , is not so small ,</l>
       <l n="96">But there is room enough for all . ”</l>
       <l n="97">If he but chance to breathe a song ,</l>
       <l n="98">( He seldom sang , and never long ,)</l>
       <l n="99">The noisy , rude , malignant crowd ,</l>
       <l n="100">Where it was high , pronounced it loud :</l>
       <l n="101">Plain Truth was Pride ; and , what was sillier ,</l>
       <l n="102">Easy and Friendly was Familiar .</l>
       <l n="103">Or , if he tuned his lofty lays ,</l>
       <l n="104">With solemn air to Virtue 's praise ,</l>
       <l n="105">Alike abusive and erroneous ,</l>
       <l n="106">They call 'd it hoarse and inharmonious .</l>
       <l n="107">Yet so it was to souls like theirs ,</l>
       <l n="108">Tuneless as Abel to the bears !</l>
       <l n="109">A Rook<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>with harsh malignant caw</l>
       <l n="110">Began , was follow 'd by a Daw ;<span corresp="#note6_19" type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span></l>
       <l n="111">( Though some , who would be thought to know ,</l>

       <l n="114">Tom Tit<span corresp="#note7_14" type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>could write , and so he writ ;</l>
       <l n="115">A tribe of tuneless praters follow ,</l>
       <l n="116">The Jay , the Magpie , and the Swallow ;</l>
       <l n="117">And twenty more their throats let loose ,</l>
       <l n="118">Down to the witless , waddling Goose .</l>
       <l n="119">Some peck 'd at him , some flew , some flutter 'd ,</l>
       <l n="120">Some hiss 'd , some scream 'd , and others mutter 'd :</l>
       <l n="121">The Crow , on carrion wont to feast ,</l>
       <l n="122">The Carrion Crow , condemn 'd his taste :</l>
       <l n="123">The Rook , in earnest too , not joking ,</l>
       <l n="124">Swore all his singing was but croaking .</l>
       <l n="125">Some thought they meant to show their wit ,</l>
       <l n="126">Might think so still — “ but that they writ ” —</l>
       <l n="127">Could it be spite or envy ?— “ No —</l>
       <l n="128">Who did no ill could have no foe . ” —</l>
       <l n="129">So wise Simplicity esteem 'd ;</l>
       <l n="130">Quite otherwise True Wisdom deem 'd ;</l>

     <p>ANSWER TO DR. DELANY 'S FABLE OF THE PHEASANT AND LARK . 1730</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">In ancient times , the wise were able</l>
       <l n="2">In proper terms to write a fable :</l>
       <l n="3">Their tales would always justly suit</l>
       <l n="4">The characters of every brute .</l>
       <l n="5">The ass was dull , the lion brave ,</l>
       <l n="6">The stag was swift , the fox a knave ;</l>
       <l n="7">The daw a thief , the ape a droll ,</l>
       <l n="8">The hound would scent , the wolf would prowl :</l>
       <l n="9">A pigeon would , if shown by Æsop ,</l>
       <l n="10">Fly from the hawk , or pick his pease up .</l>
       <l n="11">Far otherwise a great divine</l>
       <l n="12">Has learnt his fables to refine ;</l>
       <l n="13">He jumbles men and birds together ,</l>
       <l n="14">As if they all were of a feather :</l>
       <l n="15">You see him first the Peacock bring ,</l>
       <l n="16">Against all rules , to be a king ;</l>
       <l n="17">That in his tail he wore his eyes ,</l>
       <l n="18">By which he grew both rich and wise .</l>
       <l n="19">Now , pray , observe the doctor 's choice ,</l>
       <l n="20">A Peacock chose for flight and voice ;</l>
       <l n="21">Did ever mortal see a peacock</l>
       <l n="22">Attempt a flight above a haycock ?</l>
       <l n="23">And for his singing , doctor , you know</l>
       <l n="24">Himself complain 'd of it to Juno .</l>
       <l n="25">He squalls in such a hellish noise ,</l>
       <l n="26">He frightens all the village boys .</l>
       <l n="27">This Peacock kept a standing force ,</l>
       <l n="28">In regiments of foot and horse :</l>
       <l n="29">Had statesmen too of every kind ,</l>
       <l n="30">Who waited on his eyes behind ;</l>
       <l n="31">And this was thought the highest post ;</l>
       <l n="32">For , rule the rump , you rule the roast .</l>
       <l n="33">The doctor names but one at present ,</l>
       <l n="34">And he of all birds was a Pheasant .</l>
       <l n="35">This Pheasant was a man of wit ,</l>
       <l n="36">Could read all books were ever writ ;</l>
       <l n="37">And , when among companions privy ,</l>
       <l n="38">Could quote you Cicero and Livy .</l>
       <l n="39">Birds , as he says , and I allow ,</l>
       <l n="40">Were scholars then , as we are now ;</l>
       <l n="41">Could read all volumes up to folios ,</l>
       <l n="42">And feed on fricassees and olios :</l>
       <l n="43">This Pheasant , by the Peacock 's will ,</l>
       <l n="44">Was viceroy of a neighbouring hill ;</l>
       <l n="45">And , as he wander 'd in his park ,</l>
       <l n="46">He chanced to spy a clergy Lark ;</l>
       <l n="47">Was taken with his person outward ,</l>
       <l n="48">So prettily he pick 'd a cow-t — d :</l>
       <l n="49">Then in a net the Pheasant caught him ,</l>
       <l n="50">And in his palace fed and taught him .</l>
       <l n="51">The moral of the tale is pleasant ,</l>
       <l n="52">Himself the Lark , my lord the Pheasant :</l>
       <l n="53">A lark he is , and such a lark</l>
       <l n="54">As never came from Noah 's ark :</l>
       <l n="55">And though he had no other notion ,</l>
       <l n="56">But building , planning , and devotion ;</l>
       <l n="57">Though ‘ tis a maxim you must know ,</l>
       <l n="58">“ Who does no ill can have no foe ; ”</l>
       <l n="59">Yet how can I express in words</l>
       <l n="60">The strange stupidity of birds ?</l>
       <l n="61">This Lark was hated in the wood ,</l>
       <l n="62">Because he did his brethren good .</l>
       <l n="63">At last the Nightingale comes in ,</l>
       <l n="64">To hold the doctor by the chin :</l>
       <l n="65">We all can find out what he means ,</l>
       <l n="66">The worst of disaffected deans :</l>
       <l n="67">Whose wit at best was next to none ,</l>
       <l n="68">And now that little next is gone ;</l>
       <l n="69">Against the court is always blabbing ,</l>
       <l n="70">And calls the senate-house a cabin ;</l>
       <l n="71">So dull , that but for spleen and spite ,</l>
       <l n="72">We ne'er should know that he could write</l>
       <l n="73">Who thinks the nation always err 'd ,</l>
       <l n="74">Because himself is not preferr 'd ;</l>

       <l n="35">O ! tack , my lord , some pretty cure ,</l>

       <l n="37">The garden stored with artless flowers ,</l>

       <l n="45">A limpid brook shall trout supply ,</l>
       <l n="46">In May , to take the mimic fly ;</l>
       <l n="47">Round a small orchard may it run ,</l>
       <l n="48">Whose apples redden to the sun .</l>
       <l n="49">Let all be snug , and warm , and neat ;</l>
       <l n="50">For fifty turn 'd a safe retreat ,</l>

       <l n="66">My heart is good ; but assets fail ,</l>
       <l n="67">To fight with storms of snow and hail .</l>
       <l n="68">Besides , the country 's thin of people ,</l>
       <l n="69">Who seldom meet but at the steeple :</l>
       <l n="70">The strapping dean , that 's gone to Down ,</l>
       <l n="71">Ne'er named the thing without a frown ,</l>
       <l n="72">When , much fatigued with sermon study ,</l>
       <l n="73">He felt his brain grow dull and muddy ;</l>
       <l n="74">No fit companion could be found ,</l>
       <l n="75">To push the lazy bottle round :</l>
       <l n="76">Sure then , for want of better folks</l>
       <l n="77">To pledge , his clerk was orthodox .</l>
       <l n="78">Ah ! how unlike to Gerard Street ,</l>
       <l n="79">Where beaux and belles in parties meet ;</l>
       <l n="80">Where gilded chairs and coaches throng ,</l>
       <l n="81">And jostle as they troll along ;</l>
       <l n="82">Where tea and coffee hourly flow ,</l>
       <l n="83">And gape-seed does in plenty grow ;</l>
       <l n="84">And Griz ( no clock more certain ) cries ,</l>

       <l n="86">There Lady Luna in her sphere</l>
       <l n="87">Once shone , when Paunceforth was not near ;</l>
       <l n="88">But now she wanes , and , as ‘ tis said ,</l>
       <l n="89">Keeps sober hours , and goes to bed .</l>
       <l n="90">There — but ‘ tis endless to write down</l>
       <l n="91">All the amusements of the town ;</l>
       <l n="92">And spouse will think herself quite undone ,</l>
       <l n="93">To trudge to Connor<span corresp="#note4_34" type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>from sweet London ;</l>
       <l n="94">And care we must our wives to please ,</l>
       <l n="95">Or else — we shall be ill at ease .</l>
       <l n="96">You see , my lord , what ‘ tis I lack ,</l>
       <l n="97">‘ Tis only some convenient tack ,</l>
       <l n="98">Some parsonage-house with garden sweet ,</l>
       <l n="99">To be my late , my last retreat ;</l>
       <l n="100">A decent church , close by its side ,</l>
       <l n="101">There , preaching , praying , to reside ;</l>
       <l n="102">And as my time securely rolls ,</l>
       <l n="103">To save my own and other souls .</l>

     <p>PARODY ON A CHARACTER OF DEAN SMEDLEY , WRITTEN IN LATIN BY HIMSELF<span corresp="#note1_110" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></p>
     <p>The very reverend Dean Smedley , Of dulness , pride , conceit , a medley , Was equally allow 'd to shine As poet , scholar , and divine ; With godliness could well dispense , Would be a rake , but wanted sense ; Would strictly after Truth inquire , Because he dreaded to come nigh her . For Liberty no champion bolder , He hated bailiffs at his shoulder . To half the world a standing jest , A perfect nuisance to the rest ; From many ( and we may believe him ) Had the best wishes they could give him . To all mankind a constant friend , Provided they had cash to lend . One thing he did before he went hence , He left us a laconic sentence , By cutting of his phrase , and trimming To prove that bishops were old women . Poor Envy durst not show her phiz , She was so terrified at his . He waded , without any shame , Through thick and thin to get a name , Tried every sharping trick for bread , And after all he seldom sped . When Fortune favour 'd , he was nice ; He never once would cog the dice ; But , if she turn 'd against his play , He knew to stop à quatre trois . Now sound in mind , and sound in corpus , ( Says he ) though swell 'd like any porpoise , He hies from hence at forty-four ( But by his leave he sinks a score ) To the East Indies , there to cheat , Till he can purchase an estate ; Where , after he has fill 'd his chest , He 'll mount his tub , and preach his best , And plainly prove , by dint of text , This world is his , and theirs the next . Lest that the reader should not know The bank where last he set his toe , ‘ Twas Greenwich . There he took a ship , And gave his creditors the slip . But lest chronology should vary , Upon the ides of February , In seventeen hundred eight-and-twenty , To Fort St. George , a pedler went he . Ye Fates , when all he gets is spent , RETURN HIM BEGGAR AS HE WENT !</p>
