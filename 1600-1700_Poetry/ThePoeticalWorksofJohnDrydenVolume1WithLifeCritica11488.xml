    <docTitle><titlePart>THE POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN . With Life , Critical Dissertation , and Explanatory Notes BY THE REV . GEORGE GILFILLAN . VOL . I. M. DCCC . LV . THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN . John Dryden was born on the 9th of August 1631 , at a place variously denominated Aldwincle , or Oldwincle , All Saints ; or at Oldwincle , St Peter 's , in Northamptonshire . The name Dryden or Driden , is from the North . There are Drydens still in the town of Scotland where we now write ; and the poet 's ancestors lived in the county of Cumberland . One of them , named John , removed from a place called Staff-hill , to Northamptonshire , where he succeeded to the estate of Canons-Ashby , by marriage with the daughter of Sir John Cope . John Dryden was a schoolmaster , a Puritan , and honoured , it is said , with the friendship of the celebrated Erasmus , after whom he named his son , who succeeded to the estate of Canons-Ashby , and , besides becoming a sheriff of the county of Northamptonshire , was created a knight under James I . Sir Erasmus had three sons , the third of whom , also an Erasmus , became the father of our poet . His mother was Mary , the daughter of the Rev . Henry Pickering , whose father , a zealous Puritan , had been one of the marked victims in the Gunpowder Plot . Dryden thus had connexions both on his father 's and mother 's side with that party , by deriding , defaming , and opposing which he afterwards gained much of his poetical glory .</titlePart></docTitle>

  <body>
   <p>The poet was the eldest of fourteen children — four sons and ten daughters . The honour of his birth is claimed , as already stated , by two parishes , that of Oldwincle , All Saints , and that of Oldwincle , St Peter 's , as Homer 's was of old by seven cities . His brothers and sisters have been followed , by eager biographers , into their diverging and deepening paths of obscurity — paths in which we do not choose to attend them . Dryden received the rudiments of his education at Tichmarsh or at Oundle — for here , too , we have conflicting statements . It is certain , however , that he was admitted a king 's scholar at Westminster , under the tuition of Dr Busby , whom he always respected , and who discovered in him poetical power . He encouraged him to write , as a Thursday 's night 's task , a translation of the third Satire of Persius , a writer precisely of that vigorously rhetorical , rapidly satirical , and semi-poetical school , which Dryden was qualified to appreciate and to mirror ; besides other pieces of a similar kind which are lost . During the last year of his residence at Westminster , and when only eighteen years of age , he wrote one among the ninety-eight elegies which were called forth by the sudden death of Henry Lord Hastings , and published under the title of “ Lachrymæ Musarum . ” Hastings seems to have been an amiable person , but he was besides a lord , and hinc illoe lachrymæ . We know not of what quality the other tears were , but assuredly Dryden 's is one of very suspicious sincerity , and of very little poetical merit . But even the crocodile tears of a great genius , if they fall into a fanciful shape , must be preserved ; and we have preserved his , accordingly , notwithstanding the false taste as well as doubtful truth and honesty of this his earliest poem .</p>
   <p>Shortly after , Dryden obtained a Westminster scholarship , and on the 11th of May 1650 , entered on Trinity College , Cambridge . His tutor was one John Templer , famous then as one of the many who had attempted to put a hook in the jaws of old Hobbes , the Leviathan of his time , but whose reply , as well as Hobbes ’ own book ( like a whale disappearing from a Shetland “ voe ” into the deep , with all the hooks and harpoons of his enemies along with him ) has been almost entirely forgotten . At Cambridge , Dryden was noted for regularity and diligence , and took the degree of B. A . in January 1653-4 , and in 1657 was made A. M. by a dispensation from the Archbishop of Canterbury . Once , indeed , he was rusticated for a fortnight on account of some disobedience to the vice-master . He resided , however , at his university three years after the usual term ; and although he did not become a Fellow , and made no secret , in after days , of preferring Oxford to Cambridge , yet the reason of this seems to have lain , not in any personal disgust , but in some other cause , which , says Scott , “ we may now search for in vain . ”</p>
   <p>Up till June 1654 , his father had continued to reside at his estate at Blakesley , in Northamptonshire , when he died , leaving Dryden two-thirds of a property , which was worth , in all , only £ 60 a-year . The other third was bequeathed to his mother , during her lifetime . With this miserable modicum of £ 40 a-year , the poet returned to Cambridge , and continued there , doing little , and little known as one who could do anything , till the year 1657 . The only records of the diligence of his college years , are the lines on the death of Lord Hastings , and one or two other inconsiderable copies of verses . He probably , however , employed much time in private study .</p>
   <p>While at Cambridge , he met with a young lady , a cousin of his own — Honor Driden , daughter of Sir John Driden of Chesterton — of whom he became deeply enamoured . His suit was , however , rejected , although he continued all his life on intimate terms with the family . Miss Driden died unmarried , many years after her poet lover ; and like the “ Lass of Ballochmyle ” with Burns ’ homage , learned to value it more after he became celebrated , and carefully preserved the solitary letter which Dryden wrote her .</p>
   <p>But now the university was to lose , and the world of London to receive , the poet . In the year 1657 , when about six-and-twenty years of age , Dryden repaired to London , “ clad in homely drugget , ” and with more projects in his head than pence in his pocket . He was first employed by his relative , Sir Gilbert Pickering — called the “ Fiery Pickering , ” from his Roundhead zeal — as a clerk or secretary . Here he came in contact with Cromwell ; and saw very clearly those great qualities of sagacity , determination , courage , statesmanship , insight and genuine godliness , which made him , next to Alfred the Great , the first monarch who ever sat on the English throne . Two years after Dryden came to London , Cromwell expired , and the poet wrote and published his Heroic Stanzas on the hero 's death , which we consider really his earliest poem . When Richard resigned , Dryden , in common with the majority of the nation , saw that the Roundhead cause was lost , and hastened to carry over his talents to the gaining side . For this we do not blame him very severely , although it certainly had been nobler if , like Milton , he had clung to his party . Sir Walter Scott remarks , that Dryden never retracted the praise he gave to Cromwell . In “ Absalom and Achitophel ” he sneers at Richard as Ishbosheth , but says nothing against the deceased giant Saul . It is clear , too , that at first his desertion of the Cromwell party was a loss to the poet . He lost the chance of their favour , in case a reaction should come , his situation as secretary , and the shelter of Pickering 's princely mansion . As might have been expected , his ancient friends were indignant at the change , and not less so at the alteration he thought proper at the same time to make in the spelling of his name — from Driden to Dryden .</p>
   <p>He went to reside in the obscure house of one Herringman , a bookseller , in the New Exchange , and became for life a professional author . His enemies afterwards reproached him bitterly for his mean circumstances at this period of his life , and asserted that he was a mere drudge to Herringman . He , at all events , did little in his own proper poetic calling for two years . A poem on the Coronation of Charles , well fitted to wipe away the stain of Cromwellism , and to attract upon the poet the eye of that Rising-Sun , whose glory he sang with more zeal than truth ; a panegyric on the Lord Chancellor ; and a satire on the Dutch ; were all , and are all short , and all savour of a vein somewhat hide-bound . He planned , indeed , too , and partly wrote , one or more plays , and was considered of consequence enough to be elected a member of the Royal Society in 1662 . Previous to this he had been introduced , through Herringman , to Sir Robert Howard , son of the first Earl of Berkshire , and a relation of Edward Howard , the author of “ British Princes , ” and the object of the witty wrath of Butler . Sir Robert , too , had a poetical propensity , and Dryden and he became and continued intimate for a number of years , the poet assisting the knight in his literary compositions , particularly in a play entitled “ The Indian Queen ; ” and the latter inviting the former to the family seat at Charlton , where Dryden met in an unlucky hour his future wife , Lady Elizabeth Howard , the sister of Sir Robert . It was on the 1st of December 1663 , in St Swithin 's , London , and with the consent of the Earl , who settled about £ 60 a-year on his daughter , that this unhappy union took place . The lady seems to have had absolutely none of the qualities which tend either to command a husband 's respect or to conciliate his regard , but is described as a woman of violent temper and weak understanding . Much of the bitterness of Dryden 's satire , some of the coarse licentiousness of his plays , and all the sarcasms at matrimony which he has scattered in multitudes , throughout his works , may be traced to his domestic unhappiness .</p>
   <p>Otherwise , the match had some advantages . It broke up , for a time at least , some licentious connexions he had formed , particularly , after a time , one with Mrs Reeves the actress , with whom , having laid aside his Norwich drugget , he used to eat tarts at the Mulberry Gardens , “ with a sword and a Chadreux wig . ” It secured to him , including his own property , an income of about £ 100 a-year — a sum equal to £ 300 now — and which , on the death of his mother , three years later , was increased by £ 20 more , or £ 60 at the present value of money . He was thus protected for life against the meaner and more miserable necessities of the literary man , under which many of his unfortunate rivals were crushed ; and if he could not always command luxuries , he was always sure of bread .</p>
   <p>To improve his circumstances , however , and to enable him to keep up a style of living in unison with his lady 's rank , he must write , and the question arose , what mode of composition was likely to be the most lucrative ? Were he to continue to indite panegyrical verses , like those to Clarendon , he stood a chance of having a few guineas tossed to him now and then by a patron , like a crust to an unfortunate cur . Were he to translate , or write prefaces for the booksellers , he might pay his bill for salt , if diligent enough . For Satires as yet there was little demand . The follies of the more fanatical of the Puritans were too recent , although they were beginning to ripen for the hand of Butler ; and the far grosser absurdities of the Cavaliers were yet in blossom . There remained nothing for an aspiring author but the stage , which during the previous regime had been abolished . While the French Revolution was in progress , ay , even in the depths of the reign of terror , the theatres were all open , and all crowded ; but when Cromwell was enacting his solemn and solitary part , before God , angels , and men , the petty potentates — the gods and goddesses of the stage — vanished into thin air . At his tremendous stamp their cue had been “ Exeunt omnes ” and if the spirit of Shakspeare himself had witnessed the departure , he would have added his Amen . And had he watched in their stead the gigantic actor treading his trembling stage alone , with all the world looking on , he might have remembered and re-applied his own magnificent words —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ O for a muse of fire , that would ascend</l>
     <l n="2">The brightest heaven of invention !</l>
     <l n="3">A kingdom for a stage , princes to act ,</l>
     <l n="4">And monarchs to behold the swelling scene !</l>
     <l n="5">Then should the warlike Cromwell like himself</l>
     <l n="6">Assume the port of Mars ; and at his heels ,</l>
     <l n="7">Leash 'd in like hounds , should famine , sword , and fire</l>
     <l n="8">Crouch for employment . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>No sooner had this great man passed away , and an earnest age with him , and Charles mounted the throne , than from the darkest recesses of the stews and the taverns , from the depths within depths of Alsatia or Paris , the whole tribe of dancers , fiddlers , drabs , mimes , stage-players , and playwrights , knowing that their enemy was dead , and their hour of harvest had come , emerged in swarming multitudes — multitudes swelled by the vast tribe of play-goers , who had been counting the hours since a Falstaff had made them laugh , an Ophelia made them weep , and a Lear made them tremble . And had this only issued in the revival of the drama of Shakspeare and Johnson , few could have had much to say in objection ; for that , in general , was as pure as it was powerful . But , alas , besides them there had been a Beaumont , a Fletcher , and a Massinger , with their unutterable abominations . Nay , the king and courtiers had imported from France a taste which required for its gratification a licentiousness still more abandoned , and to be cast , besides , into forms and shapes , as stiff , stately , and elaborate as the material was vile , and were not contented with pollution unless served up in a new , piquant , and unnatural manner . Our poet understood this movement of his time right well , and determined to conform to it . He knew that he could , better than any man living , pander to the popular appetite for the melodramatic , for the grandiloquent , and for the obscene . He knew the taste of Charles , and that he , above all cooks , could dress up a ragout of that putrid perfection which his king relished . And he set himself with his whole might so to do , and for thirty years and more continued his degradation of genius — a degradation unexampled , whether we consider the powers of the writer , the coarseness , quantity , and elaboration of the pollutions he perpetrated , or the length of time in which he was employed , in thus “ profaning the God-given strength and marring the lofty line . ”</p>
   <p>His other biographers — Dr Johnson , alone , with brevity and seeming reluctance — have enumerated and characterised all Dryden 's plays . We have decided only to speak of them very generally , and that for the following reasons :— 1st , We are reprinting none of them ; 2dly , From what we have read of them , we are certain that , even as works of art , they are utterly unworthy of their author , and that in morals they are , as a whole , a disgrace to human nature . We are not the least lenient or indulgent of critics . We have every wish to pity the errors , and to bear with the frequent escapades and aberrations of genius . But when we see , as in Dryden 's case , what we are forced to consider either a deliberate and systematic attempt to poison the sources of virtue , or , at least , an elaborate and incessant habit of conformity to the bad tastes of a bad age , we can think of no plea fully available for his defence . Vain to say , “ he wrote for bread . ” He did not — he wrote only for the luxuries , not the staff of life . Vain to say , “ he consulted the taste of his audience , and suited their atmosphere . ” But why did he select that atmosphere as his ? And why so much gratuitous and superfluous iniquity in his works ? “ But he wrote to gratify his monarch . ” This would form a good enough excuse for a Sporus , “ a white curd of ass ’ milk , ” but not for a strong man like Dryden . But he was “ no worse than others of his age . ” Pitiful apology ! since , being the ablest man of his day , and therefore bound to be before it , he was in reality behind it , his plays excelling all contemporary productions in wickedness as well as in wit . But his own “ conduct was latterly irreproachable . ” This we doubt , and Scott doubts so too . But even though it were true , it were damaging , because it would deprive him of the plea of passion , and reduce him from the warm human painter to the cold demon-like sculptor of unclean and abominable ideas . It never can be forgotten , that whenever Dryden translated a filthy play , he made it filthier than in the original , and that he has once and again scattered his satyr-like fancies in spots such as the Paradise of Milton , and the Enchanted Isle of Shakspeare , which every imagination and every heart previously had regarded as holy ground . The only extenuating circumstance we can mention is , that his pruriency was latterly in part relinquished and much deplored by himself , and that his poetry is , on the whole , free from it . In our critical paper , prefixed to the Second Volume , we intend to examine the question , how far an author 's faults are , or are not , to be charged upon his age .</p>
   <p>His next poem was “ Annus Mirabilis , ” published in 1667 , and counted justly one of his most vigorous , though also one of the faultiest of his poems . It includes glowing , although somewhat quaint and fantastic , descriptions of the Dutch War and the Great Fire in London . In 1668 , by the death of Sir William Davenant , the post of Poet-Laureate became vacant , and Dryden was appointed to it . He was also appointed historiographer-royal . The salary of these two offices amounted to £ 200 a year , besides the famous annual butt of canary , while his profits from the theatre were equivalent to £ 300 . His whole income was thus , at the very least , equal to a thousand pounds of our money — a great sum for a poet in that or in any age . He published , the same year , an Essay on “ Dramatic Poetry , ” vindicating his own practice of rhymed heroic verse in plays ;— a stupid French innovation , which all the ingenuity of a Dryden defended in vain . It was cast into the shape of a dialogue ,— the Duke of Dorset being one of the respondents ,— and formed the first specimen of Dryden 's easy , rambling , but most vivid , vigorous , and entertaining prose . No one was ever more ready than he to render reasons for his writings ,— for their faults as well as merits ,— and to show by more ingenious arguments , that , if they failed , they ought to have succeeded .</p>
   <p>At this time we may consider Dryden 's prosperity , although not his powers , to have culminated . He had a handsome income , a run of unparalleled popularity as a playwright ; he was Poet-Laureate , a favourite at court , and on terms of intimacy with many of the nobility , and many of the eminent men of letters . The public would have at that time bid high for his very snuff-papers , and were thankful for whatever garbage he chose to throw at them from the stage . How different his position from that of the great blind old man , at this time residing in Bunhill-fields in obscurity and sorrow , and preparing to put off his tabernacle , and take his flight to the Heavens of God ! The one heard every night the “ claps of multitudes , ” — the other the whispers of angels , saying to his soul , “ Sister-spirit , come away . ” The one was revelling in reputation ,— the other was listening to the far-off echoes of a coming fame as wide as the world , and as permanent as the existence of man . To do Dryden justice , he admired Milton ; and although he did , and that , too , immediately after Milton departed , venture to travestie the “ Paradise Lost ” into a rhymed play , as dull as it is disgusting ; and although he knew that Milton had called him , somewhat harshly , a “ good rhymer , but no poet , ” yet he praised his genius at a time when it was as little appreciated , as was the grandeur of his character .</p>
   <p>But now the slave , in the chariot of Dryden 's triumph , was about to appear . First came , in 1671 , the “ Rehearsal , ” a play concocted among various wits of the time , including Sprat , Clifford , poor Butler , of “ Hudibras , ” and chiefly the Duke of Buckingham . The object of this play was to turn rhymed heroic tragedy , and especially the great playwright of the day , under the name of Bayes , his person , manners , conversation , and habits , into unmitigated ridicule . The plan has often since been followed , with various success . Minor wits have delighted in clubbing their small but poisoned missiles , and in aiming flights of minnikin arrows at the Gullivers of their different periods . Thus Pope was assailed by the “ Dunces , ” whom he afterwards preserved in amber — that terrible old lion , Bentley , by Boyle and his associates ; and Wordsworth , by the critics or criticasters of his day . Dryden acted with greater prudence than any of those we have named , except indeed Bentley , who , being assailed upon points involving the integrity of his scholarship , and on which demonstrative contradiction was possible , felt himself compelled to leave his lair , and to rend his enemies in pieces . But Dryden — feeling on this occasion , at least , that a squib , however personal and severe , cannot harm any man worthy of the name ; and that the very force of the laughter it produces , drives out the sting — determined to answer it by silence , and to bide his time . “ Zimri , ” in Absalom and Achitophel , shows how deep had been his secret oath of vengeance , and how carefully the sweltered “ venom ” had been kept , in which at last he baptizes Buckingham , and embalms him at the same time for the wonder and contempt of posterity . Here is the danger of the smaller wits in a controversy of this kind . Their squibs excite a sensation at the moment , and sometimes annoy the assaulted giant much , and his friends and publishers more ; but he continues to live and grow , while their spiteful effusions perish ; or worse , are preserved to the everlasting shame of their authors , on the lowest shelf of the records of their enemy 's fame .</p>
   <p>Two years after , occurred the famous controversy between Dryden and Settle . Poor Elkanah Settle seemed raised up like another Mordecai to poison the peace and disturb the false self-satisfaction of Dryden ,— raised up , rather — shall we say ?— to wean the poet from a sphere where his true place and power were not , and to prepare him for other stages , where he was yet destined far more powerfully to play his part . At all events , this should have been his inference from the success of Settle . It should have taught him that a scene where a pitiful poetaster , backed by mob-favour and the word of a Rochester , could eclipse his glory , was no scene for him ; and he ought instantly , with proud humility , to have left the theatre for ever . Instead of this , he fell into a violent passion with one who , like himself , had levelled his desires to the “ claps of multitudes , ” and had ravished the larger share of the coveted prize ! And so there commenced a long and ludicrous controversy — dishonourable to Settle much ; to Rochester and Dryden more — between a mere insolent twaddler and a man of real and transcendent genius . The particulars of the struggle are too humiliating and contemptible to deserve a minute record . Suffice it , that Dryden , assisted by his future foe , Shadwell , wrote a scurrilous attack on Settle , and his successful play , “ The Empress of Morocco ; ” to which Settle , nothing daunted , replied in terms of equal coarseness , and that Rochester , the patron of Settle , became mixed up in the fray , till , having been severely handled by Dryden in his “ Essay on Satire , ” — a production generally , and we think justly , attributed to Mulgrave and Dryden in conjunction ,— he took a mean and characteristic revenge . He hired bravoes , who , waiting for Dryden as he was returning , on the 18th December 1679 , from Will 's coffee-house to his own house in Gerard Street , rushed out and severely beat and wounded him . That Dryden was the author of the lines on Rochester has been doubted , although we think they very much resemble a rough and hurried sketch from his pen ; that Rochester deserved the truculent treatment he received in them , this anecdote sufficiently proves . It was partly , indeed , the manner of the age . Had this nobleman existed now , and been pilloried by a true and powerful pen , he would , in addition to his own anonymous assaults , have stirred up a posse of his creatures to assist him in seeking , by falsehoods , hypercriticisms , and abuse , to diminish the influence and take away the good name of his opponent . The Satanic spirit is always the same — its weapons and instruments are continually changing .</p>
   <p>Soon after this , Dryden translated the Epistles of Ovid , thus breathing himself for the far greater efforts which were before him . His mind seems , for a season , to have balanced between various poetic plans . On the one hand , the finger of his good genius showed him the fair heights of epic song , waiting to be crowned by the coming of a new Virgil ; on the other side , the fierce fires of his passions pointed him downwards to his many rivals and foes — the Cliffords , Leighs , Ravenscrofts , Rochesters , and Settles — who seemed lying as a mark for his satiric vengeance . He meditated , we know , an epic on Arthur , the hero of the Round Table , and had , besides , many arrears of wrath lying past for discharge ; but circumstances arose which turned his thoughts away , for a season , in a different direction from either Arthur or his personal foes .</p>
   <p>The political aspects of the times were now portentous in the extreme . Charles II . had , partly by crime , partly by carelessness , and partly by ill-fortune , become a most unpopular monarch , and the more so , because the nation had no hope even from his death , since it was sure to hand them over to the tender mercies of his brother , who had all his faults , and some , in addition , of his own , without any of his merits . There was but one hope , and that turned out a mere aurora borealis , connected with the Duke of Monmouth , who , through his extraction by a bend sinister from Charles , as well as through his popular manners , Protestant principles , and gracious exterior , had become such a favourite with the people , that strong efforts were made to exclude the Duke of York , and to exalt him to the succession . These , however , were unsuccessful ; and Shaftesbury , their leading spirit , was accused of treason , and confined to the Tower . It was at this crisis , when the nobility of the land were divided , when its clergy were divided , when its literary men were divided ,— not in a silent feud , but in a raging rupture , that Dryden , partly at the instigation of the Court , partly from his own impulse , lifted up his powerful pen ,— the sceptre of the press ,— and , with wonderful facility and felicity , wrote , and on the 17th November 1681 , published , the satire of “ Absalom and Achitophel . ” Its poetical merits — the choice of the names and period , although this is borrowed from a previous writer — the appearance of the poem at the most critical hour of the crisis — and , above all , the portraitures of character , so easy and so graphic , so free and so fearless , distinguished equally by their animus and their animation , and with dashes of generous painting relieving and diversifying the general caricature of the style ,— rendered it instantly and irresistibly popular . It excited one universal cry — from its friends , of admiration , and from its enemies , of rage . Imitations and replies multiplies around it , and sounded like assenting or like angry echoes . It did not , indeed , move the grand jury to condemn Shaftesbury ; but when , on his acquittal , a medal was struck by his friends , bearing on one side the head and name of Shaftesbury , and on the other , the sun obscured by a cloud rising over the Tower and City of London , Dryden 's aid was again solicited by the Court and the King in person , to make this the subject of a second satire ; and , with great rapidity , he produced “ The Medal — a Satire against Sedition , ” which , completing and colouring the photograph of Shaftesbury , formed the real Second Part of “ Absalom and Achitophel . ” What bore that name came a year afterwards , when the times were changed , was written partly by a feebler hand — Nahum Tate ; and flew at inferior game — Dryden 's own personal rivals and detractors .</p>
   <p>The principal of these was Shadwell , who had been an early friend of Dryden 's , and who certainly possessed a great deal of wit and talent , if he did not attain to the measure of poetic genius . His principal power lay in low comedy — his chief fault lay in his systematic and avowed imitation of the rough and drunken manners of Ben Jonson . In the eye of Dryden — whose own habits were convivial , although not to the same extent — the real faults of his opponent were his popularity as a comic writer , and his politics . Shadwell was a zealous Protestant , and the bitterest of the many who replied to the “ Medal . ” For this he became the hero of “ MacFlecknoe ” — a masterly satire , holding him up to infamy and contempt — besides sitting afterwards for the portrait of Og , in the second part of “ Absalom and Achitophel . ” Shadwell had , by and by , his revenge , by obtaining the laureateship , after the Revolution , in room of Dryden , and no doubt used the opportunity of drowning the memory of defeat in the butt of generous canary which had now for ever passed the door of his formidable rival .</p>
   <p>Dryden 's circumstances , at this time , were considerably straitened . His pension as laureate was not regularly paid ; the profits from the theatre had somewhat fallen off . He tried in various ways , by prefacing a translation of “ Plutarch 's Lives , ” by publishing a miscellany of versions from Greek and Latin authors , and by writing prologues to plays and prefaces to books , to supply his exhausted exchequer . His good-humoured but heartless monarch set him on another task , for which he was never paid , writing a translation of Maimbourg 's “ History of the League , ” the object of which was to damage Shaftesbury and his party , by branding them as enemies to monarchy . In 1682 he wrote his “ Religio Laici . ”</p>
   <p>Not long after , in February 1684 , Charles II . became , for the first time in his life , serious , as he felt death — the proverbial terror of kings — rapidly rushing upon him . He tried to hide the great and terrible fact from his eyes under the shield of a wafer . He died suddenly — a member of the “ holy Roman Catholic Church , ” — and much regretted by all his mistresses ; and apparently by Dryden , who had been preparing the opera of “ Albion and Albanius , ” to commemorate the king 's triumph over the Whigs , when this event turned his harp into mourning , and his organ into the voice of them that weep . He set himself to write a poem which should at once express regret for the set , and homage to the rising , sun . This was his “ Threnodia Augustalis , ” a very unequal poem , but full of inimitable passages , and discovering all that careless greatness which characterised the genius of the poet .</p>
   <p>Charles II . had , at Dryden 's request , to whom arrears for four years had been due , raised his laureate salary to £ 300 . The additional hundred dropped at the king 's death , and James was mean enough even to curtail the annual butt of sack . He probably had little hope of converting the author of “ Religio Laici ” to his faith , else he would not have withheld what Charles had so recently granted . Afterwards , when he ascertained that an interesting process was going on in Dryden 's mind , tending to Popery , he perhaps thought that a little money cast into the crucible might materially determine the projection in the proper way ; or perhaps the prospect produced , or at least accelerated , the process . We admire much in Scott 's elaborate and ingenious defence of Dryden 's change of faith ; and are ready to grant that it was only a Pyrrhonist , not a Protestant , who became a Papist after all — but there was , as Dr Johnson also thinks , an ugly coincidence between the pension and the conversion . Grant that it was not bestowed for the first time by James , it had been withheld by him , and its restoration immediately followed the change of his faith . Dr Johnson was pleased , when Andrew Miller said that he “ thanked God he was done with him , ” to know that Miller “ thanked God for anything ; ” and so , when we consider the blasphemy , profanity , and filth of Dryden 's plays , and the unsettled and veering state of his religious and political opinions , we are almost glad to find him becoming “ anything , ” although it was only the votary of a dead and corrupted form of Christianity . You like to see the fierce , capricious , and destructive torrent fixed , although it be fixed in ice .</p>
   <p>That he found comfort in his new religion , and proved his sincerity by rearing up his children in the faith which his wife had also embraced , and by remaining a Roman Catholic after the Revolution , and to his own pecuniary loss , has often been asserted . But surely there is a point where the most inconsistent man is obliged to stop , if he would escape the character of an absolute weather-cock ; and that there are charms and comforts in the Popish creed for one who felt with Dryden , that he had , partly in his practice , and far more in his writings , sinned against the laws of morality and common decency , we readily grant . Whether these charms he legitimate , and these comforts sound , is a very different question . Had Dryden , besides , turned Protestant again , we question if it would have saved him his laureate pensions , and it would certainly have blasted him for ever , under the charge of ingratitude to his benefactor James . On the whole , this passage of the poet 's life is not very creditable to his memory , and his indiscriminate admirers had better let it alone . It would have strained the ingenuity and the enthusiasm of Claud Halcro himself to have extracted matter for a panegyrical ode on this conversion of “ glorious John . ”</p>
   <p>Admitted into the bosom of the Church , he soon found that he must prove his faith by his works . He was employed by James to defend the reasons of conversion to the Catholic faith alleged by Anne Duchess of York , and the two other papers on the same subject which , found in Charles ’ strong box , James had imprudently given to the world . This led him to a contest with Stillingfleet , in which Dryden came off only second best . He next , in an embowered walk , in a country retirement at Rushton , near his birthplace , composed his strange , unequal , but brilliant and ingenious poem , “ The Hind and the Panther , ” the object of which was to advocate King James ’ repeal of the Test Act , and to prove the immeasurable superiority of the Church of Rome to that of England , as well as to all the dissenting sects . This piece produced a prodigious clamour against the author . Its plan was pronounced ridiculous — its argument one-sided — its zeal assumed — and Montague and Prior , two young men then rising into eminence , wrote a clever parody on it , entitled the “ Town and Country Mouse . ” In addition to this , he wrote a translation of Varilla 's “ History of Heresies , ” and a life of Francis Xavier , the famous apostle of the Indies , whose singular story , a tale of heroic endurance and unexampled labours , but bedropt with the most flagrant falsehoods , whether it be read in Dryden 's easy and fascinating narrative , or in the more gorgeous and coloured account of Sir James Stephen , in the “ Edinburgh Review , ” forms one of the most impressive displays of human strength and folly , of the greatness of devoted enthusiasm , and of the weakness and credulity of abject superstition .</p>
   <p>In spite of all these attempts to bolster up a tottering throne and an effete faith , the Revolution came , and Dryden 's hopes and prospects sank like a vision of the night . And now came the hour of his enemies ’ revenge ! How the Settles , the Shadwells , and the Ravenscrofts , rejoiced at the downfall of their great foe ! and what ironical condolence , or bitter satirical exultation , they poured over his humiliation ! And , worst of all , he durst not reply . “ His powers of satire , ” says Scott , “ at this period , were of no more use to Dryden than a sword to a man who cannot draw it . ” The fate of Milton in miniature had now befallen him ; and it says much for the strength of his mind , that , as in Milton 's case , Dryden 's purest and best titles to fame date from his discomfiture and degradation . Antæus-like , he had now reached the ground , and the touch of the ground to him , as to all giants , was inspiration .</p>
   <p>His history , from this date , becomes , still more than in the former portions of it , a history of his publications . He was forced back by necessity to the stage . In 1690 , and in the next two years , he produced four dramas ,— one of them , indeed , adapted from the French , but the other three , original ; and one , Don Sebastian , deemed to rank among the best of his dramatic works . In 1693 , another volume of miscellanies , with more translations , appeared . He also published , about this time , a new version of “ Juvenal and Persius , ” portions of which were contributed by his sons John and Charles . His last play , “ Love Triumphant , ” was enacted — as his first , the “ Wild Gallant , ” had been — without success ; and it is remarkable , that while the curtain dropped heavily and slowly upon Dryden , it was opening upon Congreve , whose first comedy was enacted the same year with Dryden 's last , and who became the lawful heir of much of Dryden 's licentiousness , and of more than his elegance and wit .</p>
   <p>He next commenced the translation of “ Virgil , ” which in the course of three years he completed , and gave to the world . It was published in July 1697 . He had dashed it off with the utmost freedom and fire , and no work was ever more thoroughly identified with its translator . It is Dryden 's “ Virgil , ” every line of it . A great and almost national interest was felt in the undertaking , such as would be felt now , were it announced that Tennyson was engaged in a translation of Goethe . Addison supplied arguments , and an essay on the “ Georgics . ” A dedication to the new king was expected by the Court , but inexorably declined by the poet . It came forth , notwithstanding , amidst universal applause ; nor was the remuneration for the times small , amounting to at least £ 1200 or £ 1400 .</p>
   <p>So soon as this great work was off his hands , by way , we suppose , as Scott was used to say , of “ refreshing the machiner , ” Dryden wrote his famous ode , “ Alexander 's Feast , ” for a meeting of the Musical Society on St Cecilia 's day ,— wrote it , according to Bolingbroke , at one sitting , although he spent , it is said , a fortnight in polishing it into its present rounded and perfect form . It took the public by storm , and excited a greater sensation than any of the poet 's productions , except “ Absalom and Achitophel . ” Dryden himself , when complimented on it as the finest ode in the language , owned the soft impeachment , and said , “ A nobler ode never was produced , and never will ; ” and in a manner , if not absolutely , he was right .</p>
   <p>Dryden was now again at sea for a subject . Sometimes he revolved once more his favourite plan of an Epic poem , and “ Edward the Black Prince ” loomed for a season before him as its hero . Sometimes he looked up with an ambitious eye to Homer , and we see his hand “ pawing ” like the hoof of the war-horse in Job , as he smelled his battle afar off , and panted to do for Achilles and Hector what he had done for Turnus and Æneas . He meant to have turned the “ Iliad ” into blank verse ; but , after all , translated the only book of it which he published into rhyme . But , in fine , he determined to modernise some of the fine old tales of Boccacio and Chaucer ; and in March 1699-1700 , appeared his brilliant “ Fables , ” with some other poems from his pen , for which he received £ 300 at Jonson 's hands .</p>
   <p>This was his last publication of size , although he was labouring on when death surprised him , and within the last three weeks of his life had written the “ Secular Margin , ” and the prologue and the epilogue to Fletcher 's “ Pilgrim , ” — productions remarkable as showing the ruling passion strong in death ,— the squabbling litterateur and satirist combating and kicking his enemies to the last ,— Jeremy Collier , for having accused him of licentiousness in his dramas ; Milbourne , for having attacked his “ Georgics ; ” and poor Blackmore for having doubted the orthodoxy of “ Religio Laici , ” and the decency of “ Amphitryon ” and “ Limberham . ”</p>
   <p>He had now to go a pilgrimage himself to a far country . He had long been troubled with gout and gravel ; but next came erysipelas in one of his legs ; and at last mortification , superinduced by a neglected inflammation in his toe , carried him off at three o'clock on Wednesday morning the 1st of May 1700 . He died a Roman Catholic , and in “ entire resignation to the Divine will . ” He died so poor , that he was buried by subscription , Lords Montague and Jeffries delaying the interment till the necessary funds were raised . The body , after lying embalmed and in state for ten days in the College of Physicians , was buried with great pomp in Westminster Abbey , where now , between the graves of Chaucer and Cowley , reposes the dust of Dryden .</p>
   <p>His lady survived him fourteen years , and died insane . His eldest son Charles was drowned in 1704 at Datchett , while seeking to swim across the Thames . John died at Rome of a fever in 1701 . Erasmus , who was supposed to inherit his mother 's malady , died in 1710 ; and the title which he had derived from Sir Robert passed to his uncle , the brother of the poet , and thence to his grandson . Sir Henry Edward Leigh Dryden , of Canons-Ashby , is now the representative of the ancient family .</p>
   <p>We reserve till our next volume a criticism on Dryden 's genius and works . As to his habits and manners , little is known , and that little is worn threadbare by his many biographers . In appearance he became , in his maturer years , fat and florid , and obtained the name of “ Poet Squab . ” His portraits show a shrewd , but rather sluggish face , with long gray hair floating down his cheeks , not unlike Coleridge , but without his dreamy eye , like a nebulous star . His conversation was less sprightly than solid . Sometimes men suspected that he had “ sold all his thoughts to his booksellers . ” His manners are by his friends pronounced “ modest ; ” and the word modest has since been amiably confounded by his biographers with “ pure . ” Bashful he seems to have been to awkwardness ; but he was by no means a model of the virtues . He loved to sit at Will 's coffee-house , and be the arbiter of criticism . His favourite stimulus was snuff , and his favourite amusement angling . He had a bad address , a down look , and little of the air of a gentleman . Addison is reported to have taught him latterly the intemperate use of wine ; but this was said by Dennis , who admired Dryden , and who hated Addison ; and his testimony is impotent against either party . We admire the simplicity of the critics who can read his plays , and then find himself a model of continence and virtue . “ Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh ; ” and a more polluted mouth than Dryden 's never uttered its depravities on the stage . We cannot , in fine , call him personally a very honest , a very high-minded , or a very good man , although we are willing to count him amiable , ready to make very considerable allowance for his period and his circumstances , not disposed to think him so much a renegado and deliberate knave as a fickle , needy , and childish changeling , in the matter of his “ perversion ” to Popery ; although we yield to none in admiration of the varied , highly-cultured , masculine , and magnificent forces of his genius .</p>

     <l n="2">The honour of his ancient family ;</l>
     <l n="3">Beauty and learning thus together meet ,</l>
     <l n="4">To bring a winding for a wedding-sheet ?</l>
     <l n="5">Must Virtue prove Death 's harbinger ? must she ,</l>

     <l n="7">Is death , Sin 's wages , Grace 's now ? shall Art</l>
     <l n="8">Make us more learned , only to depart ?</l>
     <l n="9">If merit be disease ; if virtue death ;</l>
     <l n="10">To be good , not to be ; who 'd then bequeath 10</l>
     <l n="11">Himself to discipline ? who 'd not esteem</l>
     <l n="12">Labour a crime ? study , self-murder deem ?</l>
     <l n="13">Our noble youth now have pretence to be</l>
     <l n="14">Dunces securely , ignorant healthfully .</l>
     <l n="15">Rare linguist , whose worth speaks itself , whose praise ,</l>
     <l n="16">Though not his own , all tongues besides do raise :</l>
     <l n="17">Than whom great Alexander may seem less ,</l>
     <l n="18">Who conquer 'd men , but not their languages .</l>
     <l n="19">In his mouth nations spake ; his tongue might be</l>
     <l n="20">Interpreter to Greece , France , Italy . 20</l>
     <l n="21">His native soil was the four parts o ’ the Earth ;</l>
     <l n="22">All Europe was too narrow for his birth .</l>
     <l n="23">A young apostle ; and , with reverence may</l>
     <l n="24">I speak it , inspired with gift of tongues , as they .</l>
     <l n="25">Nature gave him , a child , what men in vain</l>
     <l n="26">Oft strive , by art though further 'd , to obtain .</l>
     <l n="27">His body was an orb , his sublime soul</l>
     <l n="28">Did move on Virtue 's and on Learning 's pole :</l>
     <l n="29">Whose regular motions better to our view ,</l>

     <l n="47">Replenish 'd then with such rare gifts as these ,</l>
     <l n="48">Where was room left for such a foul disease ?</l>
     <l n="49">The nation 's sin hath drawn that veil , which shrouds</l>
     <l n="50">Our day-spring in so sad benighting clouds : 50</l>
     <l n="51">Heaven would no longer trust its pledge ; but thus</l>
     <l n="52">Recall 'd it ; rapt its Ganymede from us .</l>
     <l n="53">Was there no milder way but the small-pox ,</l>
     <l n="54">The very filthiness of Pandora 's box ?</l>
     <l n="55">So many spots , like næves on Venus ’ soil ,</l>

     <l n="73">Must all these aged sires in one funeral</l>
     <l n="74">Expire ? all die in one so young , so small ?</l>
     <l n="75">Who , had he lived his life out , his great fame</l>
     <l n="76">Had swoln ‘ bove any Greek or Roman name .</l>
     <l n="77">But hasty Winter , with one blast , hath brought</l>
     <l n="78">The hopes of Autumn , Summer , Spring , to nought .</l>
     <l n="79">Thus fades the oak i ’ the sprig , i ’ the blade the corn ;</l>

     <l n="89">Grief makes me rail ; sorrow will force its way ;</l>
     <l n="90">And showers of tears , tempestuous sighs best lay . 90</l>
     <l n="91">The tongue may fail ; but overflowing eyes</l>

     <l n="2">When life and sin one common tomb had found ,</l>
     <l n="3">The first small prospect of a rising hill</l>
     <l n="4">With various notes of joy the ark did fill :</l>
     <l n="5">Yet when that flood in its own depths was drown 'd ,</l>
     <l n="6">It left behind it false and slippery ground ;</l>
     <l n="7">And the more solemn pomp was still deferr 'd ,</l>
     <l n="8">Till new-born nature in fresh looks appear 'd .</l>
     <l n="9">Thus , Royal Sir , to see you landed here ,</l>
     <l n="10">Was cause enough of triumph for a year : 10</l>
     <l n="11">Nor would your care those glorious joys repeat ,</l>
     <l n="12">Till they at once might be secure and great :</l>
     <l n="13">Till your kind beams , by their continued stay ,</l>
     <l n="14">Had warm 'd the ground , and call 'd the damps away ,</l>
     <l n="15">Such vapours , while your powerful influence dries ,</l>
     <l n="16">Then soonest vanish when they highest rise .</l>
     <l n="17">Had greater haste these sacred rites prepared ,</l>
     <l n="18">Some guilty months had in your triumphs shared :</l>
     <l n="19">But this untainted year is all your own ;</l>
     <l n="20">Your glories may without our crimes be shown . 20</l>
     <l n="21">We had not yet exhausted all our store ,</l>
     <l n="22">When you refresh 'd our joys by adding more :</l>
     <l n="23">As Heaven , of old , dispensed celestial dew ,</l>
     <l n="24">You gave us manna , and still give us new .</l>

     <l n="26">The season too comes fraught with new delight :</l>

     <l n="43">And glorious dreams stand ready to restore</l>
     <l n="44">The pleasing shapes of all you saw before .</l>
     <l n="45">Next to the sacred temple you are led ,</l>
     <l n="46">Where waits a crown for your more sacred head :</l>
     <l n="47">How justly from the church that crown is due ,</l>
     <l n="48">Preserved from ruin , and restored by you !</l>
     <l n="49">The grateful choir their harmony employ ,</l>
     <l n="50">Not to make greater , but more solemn joy . 50</l>
     <l n="51">Wrapt soft and warm your name is sent on high ,</l>
     <l n="52">As flames do on the wings of incense fly :</l>
     <l n="53">Music herself is lost ; in vain she brings</l>
     <l n="54">Her choicest notes to praise the best of kings :</l>
     <l n="55">Her melting strains in you a tomb have found ,</l>
     <l n="56">And lie like bees in their own sweetness drown 'd .</l>
     <l n="57">He that brought peace , all discord could atone ,</l>
     <l n="58">His name is music of itself alone .</l>
     <l n="59">Now while the sacred oil anoints your head ,</l>
     <l n="60">And fragrant scents , begun from you , are spread 60</l>
     <l n="61">Through the large dome ; the people 's joyful sound ,</l>
     <l n="62">Sent back , is still preserved in hallow 'd ground ;</l>
     <l n="63">Which in one blessing mix 'd descends on you ;</l>
     <l n="64">As heighten 'd spirits fall in richer dew .</l>
     <l n="65">Not that our wishes do increase your store ,</l>
     <l n="66">Full of yourself , you can admit no more :</l>
     <l n="67">We add not to your glory , but employ</l>
     <l n="68">Our time , like angels , in expressing joy .</l>
     <l n="69">Nor is it duty , or our hopes alone ,</l>
     <l n="70">Create that joy , but full fruition : 70</l>
     <l n="71">We know those blessings , which we must possess ,</l>
     <l n="72">And judge of future by past happiness .</l>
     <l n="73">No promise can oblige a prince so much</l>
     <l n="74">Still to be good , as long to have been such .</l>
     <l n="75">A noble emulation heats your breast ,</l>
     <l n="76">And your own fame now robs you of your rest .</l>
     <l n="77">Good actions still must be maintain 'd with good ,</l>
     <l n="78">As bodies nourish 'd with resembling food .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="79">You have already quench 'd sedition 's brand ;</l>
     <l n="80">And zeal , which burnt it , only warms the land . 80</l>
     <l n="81">The jealous sects , that dare not trust their cause</l>
     <l n="82">So far from their own will as to the laws ,</l>
     <l n="83">You for their umpire and their synod take ,</l>
     <l n="84">And their appeal alone to Cæsar make .</l>
     <l n="85">Kind Heaven so rare a temper did provide ,</l>
     <l n="86">That guilt , repenting , might in it confide .</l>
     <l n="87">Among our crimes oblivion may be set ;</l>
     <l n="88">But ‘ tis our king 's perfection to forget .</l>
     <l n="89">Virtues unknown to these rough northern climes</l>
     <l n="90">From milder heavens you bring , without their crimes . 90</l>
     <l n="91">Your calmness does no after-storms provide ,</l>
     <l n="92">Nor seeming patience mortal anger hide .</l>
     <l n="93">When empire first from families did spring ,</l>
     <l n="94">Then every father govern 'd as a king :</l>
     <l n="95">But you , that are a sovereign prince , allay</l>
     <l n="96">Imperial power with your paternal sway .</l>
     <l n="97">From those great cares when ease your soul unbends ,</l>
     <l n="98">Your pleasures are design 'd to noble ends :</l>
     <l n="99">Born to command the mistress of the seas ,</l>
     <l n="100">Your thoughts themselves in that blue empire please . 100</l>
     <l n="101">Hither in summer evenings you repair</l>
     <l n="102">To taste the fraicheur of the purer air :</l>
     <l n="103">Undaunted here you ride , when winter raves ,</l>
     <l n="104">With Cæsar 's heart that rose above the waves .</l>
     <l n="105">More I could sing , but fear my numbers stays ;</l>
     <l n="106">No loyal subject dares that courage praise .</l>
     <l n="107">In stately frigates most delight you find ,</l>
     <l n="108">Where well-drawn battles fire your martial mind .</l>
     <l n="109">What to your cares we owe , is learnt from hence ,</l>
     <l n="110">When even your pleasures serve for our defence . 110</l>
     <l n="111">Beyond your court flows in th ’ admitted tide ,</l>
     <l n="112">Where in new depths the wondering fishes glide :</l>
     <l n="113">Here in a royal bed<span corresp="#note30" type="note_anchor">[ 30 ]</span>the waters sleep ;</l>
     <l n="114">When tired at sea , within this bay they creep .</l>
     <l n="115">Here the mistrustful fowl no harm suspects ,</l>
     <l n="116">So safe are all things which our king protects .</l>
     <l n="117">From your loved Thames a blessing yet is due ,</l>
     <l n="118">Second alone to that it brought in you ;</l>
     <l n="119">A queen , near whose chaste womb , ordain 'd by fate ,</l>
     <l n="120">The souls of kings unborn for bodies wait . 120</l>
     <l n="121">It was your love before made discord cease :</l>
     <l n="122">Your love is destined to your country 's peace .</l>
     <l n="123">Both Indies , rivals in your bed , provide</l>
     <l n="124">With gold or jewels to adorn your bride .</l>
     <l n="125">This to a mighty king presents rich ore ,</l>
     <l n="126">While that with incense does a god implore .</l>
     <l n="127">Two kingdoms wait your doom , and , as you choose ,</l>
     <l n="128">This must receive a crown , or that must lose .</l>
     <l n="129">Thus from your royal oak , like Jove 's of old ,</l>
     <l n="130">Are answers sought , and destinies foretold : 130</l>
     <l n="131">Propitious oracles are begg 'd with vows ,</l>
     <l n="132">And crowns that grow upon the sacred boughs .</l>
     <l n="133">Your subjects , while you weigh the nation 's fate ,</l>
     <l n="134">Suspend to both their doubtful love or hate :</l>
     <l n="135">Choose only , Sir , that so they may possess ,</l>

     <l n="1">My Lord ,</l>
     <l n="2">While flattering crowds officiously appear</l>
     <l n="3">To give themselves , not you , a happy year ;</l>
     <l n="4">And by the greatness of their presents prove</l>
     <l n="5">How much they hope , but not how well they love ;</l>
     <l n="6">The Muses , who your early courtship boast ,</l>
     <l n="7">Though now your flames are with their beauty lost ,</l>
     <l n="8">Yet watch their time , that , if you have forgot</l>
     <l n="9">They were your mistresses , the world may not :</l>
     <l n="10">Decay 'd by time and wars , they only prove</l>
     <l n="11">Their former beauty by your former love ; 10</l>
     <l n="12">And now present , as ancient ladies do ,</l>
     <l n="13">That , courted long , at length are forced to woo .</l>
     <l n="14">For still they look on you with such kind eyes ,</l>
     <l n="15">As those that see the church 's sovereign rise ;</l>
     <l n="16">From their own order chose , in whose high state ,</l>
     <l n="17">They think themselves the second choice of fate .</l>
     <l n="18">When our great monarch into exile went ,</l>
     <l n="19">Wit and religion suffer 'd banishment .</l>
     <l n="20">Thus once , when Troy was wrapp 'd in fire and smoke ,</l>
     <l n="21">The helpless gods their burning shrines forsook ; 20</l>
     <l n="22">They with the vanquish 'd prince and party go ,</l>
     <l n="23">And leave their temples empty to the foe .</l>
     <l n="24">At length the Muses stand , restored again</l>
     <l n="25">To that great charge which Nature did ordain ;</l>
     <l n="26">And their loved Druids seem revived by fate ,</l>
     <l n="27">While you dispense the laws , and guide the state .</l>
     <l n="28">The nation 's soul , our monarch , does dispense ,</l>
     <l n="29">Through you , to us his vital influence :</l>
     <l n="30">You are the channel where those spirits flow ,</l>
     <l n="31">And work them higher , as to us they go . 30</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="32">In open prospect nothing bounds our eye ,</l>
     <l n="33">Until the earth seems join 'd unto the sky :</l>
     <l n="34">So , in this hemisphere , our utmost view</l>
     <l n="35">Is only bounded by our king and you :</l>
     <l n="36">Our sight is limited where you are join 'd ,</l>
     <l n="37">And beyond that no farther heaven can find .</l>
     <l n="38">So well your virtues do with his agree ,</l>
     <l n="39">That , though your orbs of different greatness be ,</l>
     <l n="40">Yet both are for each other 's use disposed ,</l>
     <l n="41">His to enclose , and yours to be enclosed . 40</l>
     <l n="42">Nor could another in your room have been ,</l>
     <l n="43">Except an emptiness had come between .</l>
     <l n="44">Well may he then to you his cares impart ,</l>
     <l n="45">And share his burden where he shares his heart .</l>
     <l n="46">In you his sleep still wakes ; his pleasures find</l>
     <l n="47">Their share of business in your labouring mind .</l>
     <l n="48">So when the weary sun his place resigns ,</l>
     <l n="49">He leaves his light , and by reflection shines .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="50">Justice , that sits and frowns where public laws</l>
     <l n="51">Exclude soft mercy from a private cause , 50</l>
     <l n="52">In your tribunal most herself does please ;</l>
     <l n="53">There only smiles because she lives at ease ;</l>
     <l n="54">And , like young David , finds her strength the more ,</l>
     <l n="55">When disencumber 'd from those arms she wore .</l>
     <l n="56">Heaven would our royal master should exceed</l>
     <l n="57">Most in that virtue which we most did need ;</l>
     <l n="58">And his mild father ( who too late did find</l>
     <l n="59">All mercy vain but what with power was join 'd )</l>
     <l n="60">His fatal goodness left to fitter times ,</l>
     <l n="61">Not to increase , but to absolve , our crimes : 60</l>
     <l n="62">But when the heir of this vast treasure knew</l>
     <l n="63">How large a legacy was left to you</l>
     <l n="64">( Too great for any subject to retain ) ,</l>
     <l n="65">He wisely tied it to the crown again :</l>
     <l n="66">Yet , passing through your hands , it gathers more ,</l>
     <l n="67">As streams , through mines , bear tincture of their ore .</l>
     <l n="68">While empiric politicians use deceit ,</l>
     <l n="69">Hide what they give , and cure but by a cheat ;</l>
     <l n="70">You boldly show that skill which they pretend ,</l>
     <l n="71">And work by means as noble as your end : 70</l>
     <l n="72">Which should you veil , we might unwind the clew ,</l>
     <l n="73">As men do nature , till we came to you .</l>
     <l n="74">And as the Indies were not found , before</l>
     <l n="75">Those rich perfumes , which , from the happy shore ,</l>
     <l n="76">The winds upon their balmy wings convey 'd ,</l>
     <l n="77">Whose guilty sweetness first their world betray 'd ;</l>
     <l n="78">So by your counsels we are brought to view</l>
     <l n="79">A rich and undiscover 'd world in you .</l>
     <l n="80">By you our monarch does that fame assure ,</l>
     <l n="81">Which kings must have , or cannot live secure : 80</l>
     <l n="82">For prosperous princes gain their subjects ’ heart ,</l>
     <l n="83">Who love that praise in which themselves have part .</l>
     <l n="84">By you he fits those subjects to obey ,</l>
     <l n="85">As heaven 's eternal Monarch does convey</l>
     <l n="86">His power unseen , and man to his designs ,</l>
     <l n="87">By his bright ministers the stars , inclines .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="88">Our setting sun , from his declining seat ,</l>
     <l n="89">Shot beams of kindness on you , not of heat :</l>
     <l n="90">And , when his love was bounded in a few</l>
     <l n="91">That were unhappy that they might be true , 90</l>
     <l n="92">Made you the favourite of his last sad times ,</l>
     <l n="93">That is a sufferer in his subjects ’ crimes :</l>
     <l n="94">Thus those first favours you received , were sent ,</l>
     <l n="95">Like heaven 's rewards in earthly punishment .</l>
     <l n="96">Yet fortune , conscious of your destiny ,</l>
     <l n="97">Even then took care to lay you softly by ;</l>
     <l n="98">And wrapp 'd your fate among her precious things ,</l>
     <l n="99">Kept fresh to be unfolded with your king 's .</l>
     <l n="100">Shown all at once , you dazzled so our eyes ,</l>
     <l n="101">As new born Pallas did the gods surprise , 100</l>
     <l n="102">When , springing forth from Jove 's new-closing wound ,</l>
     <l n="103">She struck the warlike spear into the ground ;</l>
     <l n="104">Which sprouting leaves did suddenly enclose ,</l>
     <l n="105">And peaceful olives shaded as they rose .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="106">How strangely active are the arts of peace ,</l>
     <l n="107">Whose restless motions less than war 's do cease !</l>
     <l n="108">Peace is not freed from labour but from noise ;</l>
     <l n="109">And war more force , but not more pains employs ;</l>
     <l n="110">Such is the mighty swiftness of your mind ,</l>
     <l n="111">That , like the earth , it leaves our sense behind ; 110</l>
     <l n="112">While you so smoothly turn and roll our sphere ,</l>
     <l n="113">That rapid motion does but rest appear .</l>
     <l n="114">For , as in nature 's swiftness , with the throng</l>
     <l n="115">Of flying orbs while ours is borne along ,</l>
     <l n="116">All seems at rest to the deluded eye ,</l>
     <l n="117">Moved by the soul of the same harmony ,—</l>
     <l n="118">So , carried on by your unwearied care ,</l>
     <l n="119">We rest in peace , and yet in motion share .</l>
     <l n="120">Let envy then those crimes within you see ,</l>
     <l n="121">From which the happy never must be free ; 120</l>
     <l n="122">Envy , that does with misery reside ,</l>
     <l n="123">The joy and the revenge of ruin 'd pride .</l>
     <l n="124">Think it not hard , if at so cheap a rate</l>
     <l n="125">You can secure the constancy of fate ,</l>
     <l n="126">Whose kindness sent what does their malice seem ,</l>
     <l n="127">By lesser ills the greater to redeem .</l>
     <l n="128">Nor can we this weak shower a tempest call ,</l>
     <l n="129">But drops of heat , that in the sunshine fall .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="130">You have already wearied fortune so ,</l>
     <l n="131">She cannot further be your friend or foe ; 130</l>
     <l n="132">But sits all breathless , and admires to feel</l>
     <l n="133">A fate so weighty , that it stops her wheel .</l>
     <l n="134">In all things else above our humble fate ,</l>
     <l n="135">Your equal mind yet swells not into state ,</l>
     <l n="136">But , like some mountain in those happy isles ,</l>
     <l n="137">Where in perpetual spring young nature smiles ,</l>
     <l n="138">Your greatness shows : no horror to affright ,</l>
     <l n="139">But trees for shade , and flowers to court the sight :</l>
     <l n="140">Sometimes the hill submits itself a while</l>
     <l n="141">In small descents , which do its height beguile : 140</l>
     <l n="142">And sometimes mounts , but so as billows play ,</l>
     <l n="143">Whose rise not hinders , but makes short our way .</l>
     <l n="144">Your brow , which does no fear of thunder know ,</l>
     <l n="145">Sees rolling tempests vainly beat below ;</l>
     <l n="146">And , like Olympus ’ top , the impression wears</l>
     <l n="147">Of love and friendship writ in former years .</l>
     <l n="148">Yet , unimpair 'd with labours , or with time ,</l>
     <l n="149">Your age but seems to a new youth to climb .</l>
     <l n="150">Thus heavenly bodies do our time beget ,</l>
     <l n="151">And measure change , but share no part of it . 150</l>
     <l n="152">And still it shall without a weight increase ,</l>
     <l n="153">Like this new year , whose motions never cease .</l>
     <l n="154">For since the glorious course you have begun</l>
     <l n="155">Is led by Charles , as that is by the sun ,</l>
     <l n="156">It must both weightless and immortal prove ,</l>
     <l n="157">Because the centre of it is above .</l>

     <l n="1">As needy gallants , in the scrivener 's hands ,</l>
     <l n="2">Court the rich knaves that gripe their mortgaged lands ;</l>
     <l n="3">The first fat buck of all the season 's sent ,</l>
     <l n="4">And keeper takes no fee in compliment ;</l>
     <l n="5">The dotage of some Englishmen is such ,</l>
     <l n="6">To fawn on those who ruin them — the Dutch .</l>
     <l n="7">They shall have all , rather than make a war</l>
     <l n="8">With those , who of the same religion are .</l>
     <l n="9">The Straits , the Guinea-trade , the herrings too ;</l>
     <l n="10">Nay , to keep friendship , they shall pickle you . 10</l>

     <l n="13">What injuries soe'er upon us fall ,</l>

     <l n="15">Religion wheedled us to civil war ,</l>

     <l n="17">Be gull 'd no longer ; for you 'll find it true ,</l>

     <l n="22">But states are atheists in their very frame .</l>
     <l n="23">They share a sin ; and such proportions fall ,</l>

     <l n="25">Think on their rapine , falsehood , cruelty ,</l>
     <l n="26">And that what once they were , they still would be .</l>

     <l n="29">With an ill grace the Dutch their mischiefs do ;</l>

     <l n="31">Well may they boast themselves an ancient nation ;</l>
     <l n="32">For they were bred ere manners were in fashion :</l>

    <head>THE YEAR OF WONDERS , 1666 .</head>
    <head>AN HISTORICAL POEM .</head>
     <l n="1">AN ACCOUNT OF THE ENSUING POEM , IN A LETTER TO THE HONOURABLE SIR ROBERT</l>
     <l n="2">HOWARD .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Sir ,— I am so many ways obliged to you , and so little able to return your favours , that , like those who owe too much , I can only live by getting further into your debt . You have not only been careful of my fortune , which was the effect of your nobleness , but you have been solicitous of my reputation , which is that of your kindness . It is not long since I gave you the trouble of perusing a play for me , and now , instead of an acknowledgment , I have given you a greater , in the correction of a poem . But since you are to bear this persecution , I will at least give you the encouragement of a martyr ; you could never suffer in a nobler cause . For I have chosen the most heroic subject which any poet could desire : I have taken upon me to describe the motives , the beginning , progress , and successes , of a most just and necessary war ; in it , the care , management , and prudence of our king ; the conduct and valour of a royal admiral , and of two incomparable generals ; the invincible courage of our captains and seamen ; and three glorious victories , the result of all . After this I have , in the Fire , the most deplorable , but withal the greatest , argument that can be imagined : the destruction being so swift , so sudden , so vast and miserable , as nothing can parallel in story . The former part of this poem , relating to the war , is but a due expiation for my not having served my king and country in it . All gentlemen are almost obliged to it ; and I know no reason we should give that advantage to the commonalty of England , to be foremost in brave actions , which the nobles of France would never suffer in their peasants . I should not have written this but to a person who has been ever forward to appear in all employments , whither his honour and generosity have called him . The latter part of my poem , which describes the Fire , I owe , first to the piety and fatherly affection of our monarch to his suffering subjects ; and , in the second place , to the courage , loyalty , and magnanimity of the city : both which were so conspicuous , that I wanted words to celebrate them as they deserve . I have called my poem Historical , not Epic , though both the actions and actors are as much heroic as any poem can contain . But since the action is not properly one , nor that accomplished in the last successes , I have judged it too bold a title for a few stanzas , which are little more in number than a single Iliad , or the longest of the Æneids . For this reason ( I mean not of length , but broken action , tied too severely to the laws of history ) I am apt to agree with those who rank Lucan rather among historians in verse , than Epic poets : in whose room , if I am not deceived , Silius Italicus , though a worse writer , may more justly be admitted . I have chosen to write my poem in quatrains , or stanzas of four in alternate rhyme , because I have ever judged them more noble , and of greater dignity , both for the sound and number , than any other verse in use amongst us ; in which I am sure I have your approbation . The learned languages have certainly a great advantage of us , in not being tied to the slavery of any rhyme ; and were less constrained in the quantity of every syllable , which they might vary with spondees or dactyls , besides so many other helps of grammatical figures , for the lengthening or abbreviation of them , than the modern are in the close of that one syllable , which often confines , and more often corrupts , the sense of all the rest . But in this necessity of our rhymes , I have always found the couplet verse most easy , though not so proper for this occasion : for there the work is sooner at an end , every two lines concluding the labour of the poet ; but in quatrains he is to carry it further on , and not only so , but to bear along in his head the troublesome sense of four lines together . For those who write correctly in this kind must needs acknowledge , that the last line of the stanza is to be considered in the composition of the first . Neither can we give ourselves the liberty of making any part of a verse for the sake of rhyme , or concluding with a word which is not current English , or using the variety of female rhymes ; all which our fathers practised : and for the female rhymes , they are still in use among other nations ; with the Italian in every line , with the Spaniard promiscuously , with the French alternately ; as those who have read the Alarique , the Pucelle , or any of their later poems , will agree with me . And besides this , they write in Alexandrius , or verses of six feet ; such as amongst us is the old translation of Homer by Chapman : all which , by lengthening of their chain , makes the sphere of their activity the larger . I have dwelt too long upon the choice of my stanza , which you may remember is much better defended in the preface to Gondibert ; and therefore I will hasten to acquaint you with my endeavours in the writing . In general , I will only say , I have never yet seen the description of any naval fight in the proper terms which are used at sea : and if there be any such , in another language , as that of Lucan in the third of his Pharsalia , yet I could not avail myself of it in the English ; the terms of art in every tongue bearing more of the idiom of it than any other words . We hear indeed among our poets , of the thundering of guns , the smoke , the disorder , and the slaughter ; but all these are common notions . And certainly , as those who , in a logical dispute , keep in general terms , would hide a fallacy ; so those who do it in any poetical description , would veil their ignorance .</p>

   <p>For my own part , if I had little knowledge of the sea , yet I have thought it no shame to learn : and if I have made some few mistakes , it is only , as you can bear me witness , because I have wanted opportunity to correct them ; the whole poem being first written , and now sent you from a place , where I have not so much as the converse of any seaman . Yet though the trouble I had in writing it was great , it was more than recompensed by the pleasure . I found myself so warm in celebrating the praises of military men , two such especially as the prince<span corresp="#note36" type="note_anchor">[ 36 ]</span>and general , that it is no wonder if they inspired me with thoughts above my ordinary level . And I am well satisfied , that , as they are incomparably the best subject I ever had , excepting only the royal family , so also , that this I have written of them is much better than what I have performed on any other . I have been forced to help out other arguments ; but this has been bountiful to me : they have been low and barren of praise , and I have exalted them , and made them fruitful ; but here — Omnia sponte suâ reddit justissima tellus . I have had a large , a fair , and a pleasant field ; so fertile that , without my cultivating , it has given me two harvests in a summer , and in both oppressed the reaper . All other greatness in subjects is only counterfeit ; it will not endure the test of danger ; the greatness of arms is only real ; other greatness burdens a nation with its weight , this supports it with its strength . And as it is the happiness of the age , so it is the peculiar goodness of the best of kings , that we may praise his subjects without offending him . Doubtless , it proceeds from a just confidence of his own virtue , which the lustre of no other can be so great as to darken in him ; for the good or the valiant are never safely praised under a bad or a degenerate prince . But to return from this digression to a further account of my poem ; I must crave leave to tell you , that as I have endeavoured to adorn it with noble thoughts , so much more to express those thoughts with elocution . The composition of all poems is , or ought to be , of wit ; and wit in the poet , or wit-writing ( if you will give me leave to use a school-distinction ) is no other than the faculty of imagination in the writer , which , like a nimble spaniel , beats over and ranges through the field of memory , till it springs the quarry it hunted after : or , without metaphor , which searches over all the memory for the species or ideas of those things which it designs to represent . Wit written is that which is well designed , the happy result of thought , or product of imagination . But to proceed from wit , in the general notion of it , to the proper wit of an heroic or historical poem ; I judge it chiefly to consist in the delightful imaging of persons , actions , passions , or things . It is not the jerk or sting of an epigram , nor the seeming contradiction of a poor antithesis ( the delight of an ill-judging audience in a play of rhyme ) nor the jingle of a more poor Paronomasia ; neither is it so much the morality of a grave sentence , affected by Lucan , but more sparingly used by Virgil ; but it is some lively and apt description , dressed in such colours of speech , that it sets before your eyes the absent object , as perfectly , and more delightfully than nature . So then the first happiness of the poet 's imagination is properly invention or finding of the thought ; the second is fancy , or the variation , deriving or moulding of that thought , as the judgment represents it proper to the subject ; the third is elocution , or the art of clothing and adorning that thought , so found and varied , in apt , significant , and sounding words : the quickness of the imagination is seen in the invention , the fertility in the fancy , and the accuracy in the expression . For the two first of these , Ovid is famous among the poets ; for the latter , Virgil . Ovid images more often the movements and affections of the mind , either combating between two contrary passions , or extremely discomposed by one . His words therefore are the least part of his care ; for he pictures nature in disorder , with which the study and choice of words is inconsistent . This is the proper wit of dialogue or discourse , and consequently of the drama , where all that is said is to be supposed the effect of sudden thought ; which , though it excludes not the quickness of wit in repartees , yet admits not a too curious election of words , too frequent allusions , or use of tropes , or , in fine , anything that shows remoteness of thought or labour in the writer . On the other side , Virgil speaks not so often to us in the person of another , like Ovid , but in his own : he relates almost all things as from himself , and thereby gains more liberty than the other , to express his thoughts with all the graces of elocution , to write more figuratively , and to confess as well the labour as the force of his imagination . Though he describes his Dido well and naturally , in the violence of her passions , yet he must yield in that to the Myrrha , the Biblis , the Althæa , of Ovid ; for as great an admirer of him as I am , I must acknowledge , that if I see not more of their souls than I see of Dido 's , at least I have a greater concernment for them : and that convinces me that Ovid has touched those tender strokes more delicately than Virgil could . But when action or persons are to be described , when any such image is to be set before us , how bold , how masterly are the strokes of Virgil ! We see the objects he presents us with in their native figures , in their proper motions ; but so we see them , as our own eyes could never have beheld them so beautiful in themselves . We see the soul of the poet , like that universal one of which he speaks , informing and moving through all his pictures :</p>

   <p>— lumenque juventæ Purpureum , et lætos oculis afflârat honores : Quale manus addunt ebori decus , aut ubi flavo Argentum Pariusve lapis circundatur auro .</p>
   <p>See his Tempest , his Funeral Sports , his Combat of Turnus and Æneas : and in his Georgics , which I esteem the divinest part of all his writings , the Plague , the Country , the Battle of the Bulls , the Labour of the Bees , and those many other excellent images of nature , most of which are neither great in themselves , nor have any natural ornament to bear them up : but the words wherewith he describes them are so excellent that it might be well applied to him , which was said by Ovid , Materiam superabat opus : the very sound of his words has often somewhat that is connatural to the subject ; and while we read him , we sit , as in a play , beholding the scenes of what he represents . To perform this , he made frequent use of tropes , which you know change the nature of a known word , by applying it to some other signification ; and this is it which Horace means in his epistle to the Pisos :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Dixeris egregiè , notum si callida verbum</l>
     <l n="2">Reddiderit junctura novum —</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But I am sensible I have presumed too far to entertain you with a rude discourse of that art , which you both know so well , and put into practice with so much happiness . Yet before I leave Virgil , I must own the vanity to tell you , and by you the world , that he has been my master in this poem : I have followed him everywhere , I know not with what success , but I am sure with diligence enough : my images are many of them copied from him , and the rest are imitations of him . My expressions also are as near as the idioms of the two languages would admit of in translation . And this , sir , I have done with that boldness , for which I will stand accountable to any of our little critics , who , perhaps , are no better acquainted with him than I am . Upon your first perusal of this poem , you have taken notice of some words which I have innovated ( if it be too bold for me to say refined ) upon his Latin ; which , as I offer not to introduce into English prose , so I hope they are neither improper , nor altogether inelegant in verse ; and , in this , Horace will again defend me .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Et nova , fictaque nuper , habebunt verba fidem , si</l>
     <l n="2">Græco fonte cadunt , parcè detorta —</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The inference is exceeding plain : for if a Roman poet might have liberty to coin a word , supposing only that it was derived from the Greek , was put into a Latin termination , and that he used this liberty but seldom , and with modesty ; how much more justly may I challenge that privilege to do it with the same prerequisites , from the best and most judicious of Latin writers ! In some places , where either the fancy or the words were his , or any other 's , I have noted it in the margin , that I might not seem a plagiary ; in others I have neglected it , to avoid as well tediousness , as the affectation of doing it too often . Such descriptions or images well wrought , which I promise not for mine , are , as I have said , the adequate delight of heroic poesy ; for they beget admiration , which is its proper object ; as the images of the burlesque , which is contrary to this , by the same reason beget laughter : for the one shows nature beautified , as in the picture of a fair woman , which we all admire ; the other shows her deformed , as in that of a lazar , or of a fool with distorted face and antique gestures , at which we cannot forbear to laugh , because it is a deviation from nature . But though the same images serve equally for the Epic poesy , and for the historic and panegyric , which are branches of it , yet a several sort of sculpture is to be used in them . If some of them are to be like those of Juvenal , Stantes in curribus Æmiliani , heroes drawn in their triumphal chariots , and in their full proportion ; others are to be like that of Virgil , Spirantia mollius oera : there is somewhat more of softness and tenderness to be shown in them . You will soon find I write not this without concern . Some , who have seen a paper of verses , which I wrote last year to her Highness the Duchess , have accused them of that only thing I could defend in them . They said , I did humi serpere , that I wanted not only height of fancy , but dignity of words , to set it off . I might well answer with that of Horace , Nunc non erat his locus ; I knew I addressed them to a lady , and accordingly I affected the softness of expression , and the smoothness of measure , rather than the height of thought ; and in what I did endeavour , it is no vanity to say I have succeeded . I detest arrogance ; but there is some difference betwixt that and a just defence . But I will not further bribe your candour , or the reader 's . I leave them to speak for me ; and , if they can , to make out that character , not pretending to a greater , which I have given them .</p>
   <p>And now , sir , it is time I should relieve you from the tedious length of this account . You have better and more profitable employment for your hours , and I wrong the public to detain you longer . In conclusion , I must leave my poem to you with all its faults , which I hope to find fewer in the printing by your emendations . I know you are not of the number of those , of whom the younger Pliny speaks ; Nec sunt parum multi , qui carpere amicos suos judicium vocant : I am rather too secure of you on that side . Your candour in pardoning my errors may make you more remiss in correcting them ; if you will not withal consider that they come into the world with your approbation , and through your hands . I beg from you the greatest favour you can confer upon an absent person , since I repose upon your management what is dearest to me , my fame and reputation ; and therefore I hope it will stir you up to make my poem fairer by many of your blots ; if not , you know the story of the gamester who married the rich man 's daughter , and when her father denied the portion , christened all the children by his surname , that if , in conclusion , they must beg , they should do so by one name , as well as by the other . But since the reproach of my faults will light on you , it is but reason I should do you that justice to the readers , to let them know , that , if there be anything tolerable in this poem , they owe the argument to your choice , the writing to your encouragement , the correction to your judgment , and the care of it to your friendship , to which he must ever acknowledge himself to owe all things , who is , sir , the most obedient , and most faithful of your servants ,</p>

   <p>ABSALOM AND ACHITOPHEL .<span corresp="#note66" type="note_anchor">[ 66 ]</span></p>
   <p>TO THE READER .</p>
   <p>It is not my intention to make an apology for my poem : some will think it needs no excuse , and others will receive none . The design I am sure is honest : but he who draws his pen for one party , must expect to make enemies of the other . For wit and fool are consequence of Whig and Tory ; and every man is a knave or an ass to the contrary side . There is a treasury of merits in the Fanatic church , as well as in the Popish ; and a pennyworth to be had of saintship , honesty , and poetry , for the lewd , the factious , and the blockheads : but the longest chapter in Deuteronomy has not curses enough for an Anti-Bromingham . My comfort is , their manifest prejudice to my cause will render their judgment of less authority against me . Yet if a poem have genius , it will force its own reception in the world . For there is a sweetness in good verse , which tickles even while it hurts ; and no man can be heartily angry with him who pleases him against his will . The commendation of adversaries is the greatest triumph of a writer , because it never comes unless extorted . But I can be satisfied on more easy terms : if I happen to please the more moderate sort , I shall be sure of an honest party , and , in all probability , of the best judges ; for the least concerned are commonly the least corrupt . And I confess I have laid in for those , by rebating the satire ( where justice would allow it ) , from carrying too sharp an edge . They who can criticise so weakly as to imagine I have done my worst , may be convinced , at their own cost , that I can write severely , with more ease than I can gently . I have but laughed at some men 's follies , when I could have declaimed against their vices ; and other men 's virtues I have commended , as freely as I have taxed their crimes . And now , if you are a malicious reader , I expect you should return upon me that I affect to be thought more impartial than I am . But if men are not to be judged by their professions , God forgive you Commonwealth'shYpppHeNmen for professing so plausibly for the government . You cannot be so unconscionable as to charge me for not subscribing my name ; for that would reflect too grossly upon your own party , who never dare , though they have the advantage of a jury to secure them . If you like not my poem , the fault may possibly be in my writing ( though it is hard for an author to judge against himself ) ; but more probably it is in your morals , which cannot bear the truth of it . The violent on both sides will condemn the character of Absalom , as either too favourably or too hardly drawn . But they are not the violent whom I desire to please . The fault on the right hand is to extenuate , palliate , and indulge ; and to confess freely , I have endeavoured to commit it . Besides the respect which I owe his birth , I have a greater for his heroic virtues ; and David himself could not be more tender of the young man 's life , than I would be of his reputation . But since the most excellent natures are always the most easy , and , as being such , are the soonest perverted by ill counsels , especially when baited with fame and glory ; it is no more a wonder that he withstood not the temptations of Achitophel , than it was for Adam not to have resisted the two devils , the serpent and the woman . The conclusion of the story I purposely forbore to prosecute , because I could not obtain from myself to show Absalom unfortunate . The frame of it was cut out but for a picture to the waist ; and if the draught be so far true , it is as much as I designed .</p>
   <p>Were I the inventor , who am only the historian , I should certainly conclude the piece with the reconcilement of Absalom to David . And who knows but this may come to pass ? Things were not brought to an extremity where I left the story : there seems yet to be room left for a composure ; hereafter there may be only for pity . I have not so much as an uncharitable wish against Achitophel , but am content to be accused of a good-natured error , and to hope with Origen , that the devil himself may at last be saved . For which reason , in this poem , he is neither brought to set his house in order , nor to dispose of his person afterwards as he in wisdom shall think fit . God is infinitely merciful ; and his vicegerent is only not so , because he is not infinite .</p>
   <p>The true end of satire is the amendment of vices by correction . And he who writes honestly is no more an enemy to the offender , than the physician to the patient , when he prescribes harsh remedies to an inveterate disease ; for those are only in order to prevent the chirurgeon 's work of an Ense rescindendum , which I wish not to my very enemies . To conclude all ; if the body politic have any analogy to the natural , in my weak judgment , an act of oblivion were as necessary in a hot distempered state , as an opiate would be in a raging fever .</p>

   <p>THE MEDAL .<span corresp="#note76" type="note_anchor">[ 76 ]</span></p>
   <p>A SATIRE AGAINST SEDITION .</p>
   <p>EPISTLE TO THE WHIGS .</p>
   <p>For to whom can I dedicate this poem with so much justice as to you ? It is the representation of your own hero : it is the picture drawn at length , which you admire and prize so much in little . None of your ornaments are wanting ; neither the landscape of your Tower , nor the rising sun ; nor the Anno Domini of your new sovereign 's coronation . This must needs be a grateful undertaking to your whole party ; especially to those who have not been so happy as to purchase the original . I hear the graver has made a good market of it : all his kings are bought up already ; or the value of the remainder so enhanced , that many a poor Polander , who would be glad to worship the image , is not able to go to the cost of him , but must be content to see him here . I must confess I am no great artist ; but sign-post painting will serve the turn to remember a friend by , especially when better is not to be had . Yet , for your comfort , the lineaments are true ; and though he sat not five times to me , as he did to B ., yet I have consulted history , as the Italian painters do when they would draw a Nero or a Caligula : though they have not seen the man , they can help their imagination by a statue of him , and find out the colouring from Suetonius and Tacitus . Truth is , you might have spared one side of your Medal : the head would be seen to more advantage if it were placed on a spike of the Tower , a little nearer to the sun , which would then break out to better purpose .</p>
   <p>You tell us in your preface to the “ No-Protestant Plot ” ,<span corresp="#note77" type="note_anchor">[ 77 ]</span>that you shall be forced hereafter to leave off your modesty : I suppose you mean that little which is left you ; for it was worn to rags when you put out this Medal . Never was there practised such a piece of notorious impudence in the face of an established government . I believe when he is dead you will wear him in thumb rings , as the Turks did Scanderbeg ; as if there were virtue in his bones to preserve you against monarchy . Yet all this while you pretend not only zeal for the public good , but a due veneration for the person of the king . But all men who can see an inch before them , may easily detect those gross fallacies . That it is necessary for men in your circumstances to pretend both , is granted you ; for without them there could be no ground to raise a faction . But I would ask you one civil question , what right has any man among you , or any association of men ( to come nearer to you ) , who , out of parliament , cannot be considered in a public capacity , to meet as you daily do in factious clubs , to vilify the government in your discourses , and to libel it in all your writings ? Who made you judges in Israel ? Or how is it consistent with your zeal for the public welfare , to promote sedition ? Does your definition of loyal , which is to serve the king according to the laws , allow you the licence of traducing the executive power with which you own he is invested ? You complain that his majesty has lost the love and confidence of his people ; and by your very urging it , you endeavour what in you lies to make him lose them . All good subjects abhor the thought of arbitrary power , whether it be in one or many : if you were the patriots you would seem , you would not at this rate incense the multitude to assume it ; for no sober man can fear it , either from the king 's disposition or his practice ; or even , where you would odiously lay it , from his ministers . Give us leave to enjoy the government and the benefit of laws under which we were born , and which we desire to transmit to our posterity . You are not the trustees of the public liberty ; and if you have not right to petition in a crowd , much less have you to intermeddle in the management of affairs ; or to arraign what you do not like , which in effect is everything that is done by the king and council . Can you imagine that any reasonable man will believe you respect the person of his majesty , when it is apparent that your seditious pamphlets are stuffed with particular reflections on him ? If you have the confidence to deny this , it is easy to be evinced from a thousand passages , which I only forbear to quote , because I desire they should die and be forgotten . I have perused many of your papers ; and to show you that I have , the third part of your “ No-Protestant Plot ” is much of it stolen from your dead author 's pamphlet , called the “ Growth of Popery ; ” as manifestly as Milton 's “ Defence of the English People ” is from Buchanan “ De jure regni apud Scotos : ” or your first Covenant and new Association from the holy league of the French Guisards . Any one who reads Davila , may trace your practices all along . There were the same pretences for reformation and loyalty , the same aspersions of the king , and the same grounds of a rebellion . I know not whether you will take the historian 's word , who says it was reported , that Poltrot , a Huguenot , murdered Francis Duke of Guise , by the instigations of Theodore Beza ; or that it was a Huguenot minister , otherwise called a Presbyterian ( for our church abhors so devilish a tenet ) , who first writ a treatise of the lawfulness of deposing and murdering kings of a different persuasion in religion : but I am able to prove , from the doctrine of Calvin , and principles of Buchanan , that they set the people above the magistrate ; which , if I mistake not , is your own fundamental , and which carries your loyalty no further than your liking . When a vote of the House of Commons goes on your side , you are as ready to observe it as if it were passed into a law ; but when you are pinched with any former , and yet unrepealed act of parliament , you declare that in some cases you will not be obliged by it . The passage is in the same third part of the “ No-Protestant Plot , ” and is too plain to be denied . The late copy of your intended Association , you neither wholly justify nor condemn ; but as the Papists , when they are unopposed , fly out into all the pageantries of worship , but in times of war , when they are hard pressed by arguments , lie close intrenched behind the Council of Trent : so now , when your affairs are in a low condition , you dare not pretend that to be a legal combination , but whensoever you are afloat , I doubt not but it will be maintained and justified to purpose . For , indeed , there is nothing to defend it but the sword : it is the proper time to say anything when men have all things in their power .</p>
   <p>In the mean time , you would fain be nibbling at a parallel betwixt this Association , and that in the time of Queen Elizabeth .<span corresp="#note78" type="note_anchor">[ 78 ]</span>But there is this small difference betwixt them , that the ends of one are directly opposite to the other : one with the queen 's approbation and conjunction , as head of it ; the other , without either the consent or knowledge of the king , against whose authority it is manifestly designed . Therefore you do well to have recourse to your last evasion , that it was contrived by your enemies , and shuffled into the papers that were seized ; which yet you see the nation is not so easy to believe as your own jury ; but the matter is not difficult to find twelve men in Newgate who would acquit a malefactor .</p>
   <p>I have only one favour to desire of you at parting , that when you think of answering this poem , you would employ the same pens against it , who have combated with so much success against Absalom and Achitophel : for then you may assure yourselves of a clear victory , without the least reply . Rail at me abundantly ; and , not to break a custom , do it without wit : by this method you will gain a considerable point , which is , wholly to waive the answer of my arguments . Never own the bottom of your principles , for fear they should be treason . Fall severely on the miscarriages of government ; for if scandal be not allowed , you are no freeborn subjects . If God has not blessed you with the talent of rhyming , make use of my poor stock , and welcome : let your verses run upon my feet ; and for the utmost refuge of notorious blockheads , reduced to the last extremity of sense , turn my own lines upon me , and , in utter despair of your own satire , make me satirize myself . Some of you have been driven to this bay already ; but , above all the rest , commend me to the nonconformist parson , who writ the “ Whip and Key . ” I am afraid it is not read so much as the piece deserves , because the bookseller is every week crying help at the end of his Gazette , to get it off . You see I am charitable enough to do him a kindness , that it may be published as well as printed ; and that so much skill in Hebrew derivations may not lie for waste-paper in the shop . Yet I half suspect he went no further for his learning , than the index of Hebrew names and etymologies , which is printed at the end of some English Bibles . If Achitophel signifies the brother of a fool , the author of that poem will pass with his readers for the next of kin . And perhaps it is the relation that makes the kindness . Whatever the verses are , buy them up , I beseech you , out of pity ; for I hear the conventicle is shut up , and the brother<span corresp="#note79" type="note_anchor">[ 79 ]</span>of Achitophel out of service .</p>
   <p>Now , footmen , you know , have the generosity to make a purse for a member of their society , who has had his livery pulled over his ears , and even protestant socks are bought up among you , out of veneration to the name . A dissenter in poetry from sense and English will make as good a Protestant rhymer , as a dissenter from the Church of England a Protestant parson . Besides , if you encourage a young beginner , who knows but he may elevate his style a little above the vulgar epithets of profane , and saucy jack , and atheistic scribbler , with which he treats me , when the fit of enthusiasm is strong upon him : by which well-mannered and charitable expressions I was certain of his sect before I knew his name . What would you have more of a man ? He has damned me in your cause from Genesis to the Revelations ; and has half the texts of both the Testaments against me , if you will be so civil to yourselves as to take him for your interpreter ; and not to take them for Irish witnesses . After all , perhaps you will tell me , that you retained him only for the opening of your cause , and that your main lawyer is yet behind . Now , if it so happen he meet with no more reply than his predecessors , you may either conclude that I trust to the goodness of my cause , or fear my adversary , or disdain him , or what you please ; for the short of it is , it is indifferent to your humble servant , whatever your party says or thinks of him .</p>

     <l n="25">The various piece had tired the graver 's skill !</l>
     <l n="26">A martial hero first , with early care ,</l>
     <l n="27">Blown , like a pigmy by the winds , to war .</l>
     <l n="28">A beardless chief , a rebel , e'er a man :</l>
     <l n="29">So young his hatred to his prince began .</l>
     <l n="30">Next this ( how wildly will ambition steer ! ) 30</l>
     <l n="31">A vermin wriggling in the usurper 's ear .</l>
     <l n="32">Bartering his venal wit for sums of gold ,</l>
     <l n="33">He cast himself into the saint-like mould ;</l>
     <l n="34">Groan 'd , sigh 'd , and pray 'd , while godliness was gain —</l>
     <l n="35">The loudest bagpipe of the squeaking train .</l>
     <l n="36">But , as ‘ tis hard to cheat a juggler 's eyes ,</l>
     <l n="37">His open lewdness he could ne'er disguise .</l>
     <l n="38">There split the saint : for hypocritic zeal</l>
     <l n="39">Allows no sins but those it can conceal .</l>
     <l n="40">Whoring to scandal gives too large a scope : 40</l>
     <l n="41">Saints must not trade ; but they may interlope :</l>
     <l n="42">The ungodly principle was all the same ;</l>
     <l n="43">But a gross cheat betrays his partner 's game .</l>
     <l n="44">Besides , their pace was formal , grave , and slack ;</l>
     <l n="45">His nimble wit outran the heavy pack .</l>
     <l n="46">Yet still he found his fortune at a stay :</l>
     <l n="47">Whole droves of blockheads choking up his way ;</l>
     <l n="48">They took , but not rewarded , his advice ;</l>
     <l n="49">Villain and wit exact a double price .</l>
     <l n="50">Power was his aim : but , thrown from that pretence , 50</l>
     <l n="51">The wretch turn 'd loyal in his own defence ;</l>
     <l n="52">And malice reconciled him to his prince .</l>
     <l n="53">Him , in the anguish of his soul he served ;</l>
     <l n="54">Rewarded faster still than he deserved .</l>
     <l n="55">Behold him now exalted into trust ;</l>
     <l n="56">His counsel 's oft convenient , seldom just .</l>
     <l n="57">Even in the most sincere advice he gave ,</l>
     <l n="58">He had a grudging still to be a knave .</l>
     <l n="59">The frauds he learn 'd in his fanatic years</l>
     <l n="60">Made him uneasy in his lawful gears ; 60</l>
     <l n="61">At best , as little honest as he could ,</l>
     <l n="62">And , like white witches<span corresp="#note81" type="note_anchor">[ 81 ]</span>, mischievously good .</l>
     <l n="63">To his first bias longingly he leans ;</l>
     <l n="64">And rather would be great by wicked means .</l>
     <l n="65">Thus framed for ill , he loosed our triple hold<span corresp="#note82" type="note_anchor">[ 82 ]</span>;</l>
     <l n="66">Advice unsafe , precipitous , and bold .</l>
     <l n="67">From hence those tears ! that Ilium of our woe !</l>

     <l n="77">When his just sovereign , by no impious way</l>

     <l n="100">To kill the father , and recall the son . 100</l>
     <l n="101">Some think the fools were most , as times went then ,</l>

     <l n="113">Who , to destroy the seeds of civil war ,</l>

   <p>RELIGIO LAICI ; OR , A LAYMAN 'S FAITH .</p>
   <p>AN EPISTLE .</p>
   <p>THE PREFACE .</p>
   <p>A Poem with so bold a title , and a name prefixed from which the handling of so serious a subject would not be expected , may reasonably oblige the author to say somewhat in defence , both of himself and of his undertaking . In the first place , if it be objected to me , that , being a layman , I ought not to have concerned myself with speculations which belong to the profession of divinity ; I could answer , that perhaps laymen , with equal advantages of parts and knowledge , are not the most incompetent judges of sacred things ; but in the due sense of my own weakness and want of learning , I plead not this : I pretend not to make myself a judge of faith in others , but only to make a confession of my own . I lay no unhallowed hand upon the ark , but wait on it , with the reverence that becomes me , at a distance . In the next place , I will ingenuously confess , that the helps I have used in this small treatise , were many of them taken from the works of our own reverend divines of the Church of England : so that the weapons with which I combat irreligion , are already consecrated ; though I suppose they may be taken down as lawfully as the sword of Goliah was by David , when they are to be employed for the common cause against the enemies of piety . I intend not by this to entitle them to any of my errors , which yet I hope are only those of charity to mankind ; and such as my own charity has caused me to commit , that of others may more easily excuse . Being naturally inclined to scepticism in philosophy , I have no reason to impose my opinions in a subject which is above it ; but whatever they are , I submit them with all reverence to my mother church , accounting them no farther mine , than as they are authorised , or at least uncondemned by her . And , indeed , to secure myself on this side , I have used the necessary precaution of showing this paper , before it was published , to a judicious and learned friend , a man indefatigably zealous in the service of the church and state ; and whose writings have highly deserved of both . He was pleased to approve the body of the discourse , and I hope he is more my friend than to do it out of complaisance : it is true he had too good a taste to like it all ; and amongst some other faults recommended to my second view , what I have written perhaps too boldly on St Athanasius , which he advised me wholly to omit . I am sensible enough that I had done more prudently to have followed his opinion : but then I could not have satisfied myself that I had done honestly not to have written what was my own . It has always been my thought , that heathens who never did , nor without miracle could , hear of the name of Christ , were yet in a possibility of salvation . Neither will it enter easily into my belief , that before the coming of our Saviour the whole world , excepting only the Jewish nation , should lie under the inevitable necessity of everlasting punishment , for want of that revelation , which was confined to so small a spot of ground as that of Palestine . Among the sons of Noah we read of one only who was accursed ; and if a blessing in the ripeness of time was reserved for Japhet ( of whose progeny we are ) , it seems unaccountable to me , why so many generations of the same offspring , as preceded our Saviour in the flesh , should be all involved in one common condemnation , and yet that their posterity should be entitled to the hopes of salvation : as if a bill of exclusion had passed only on the fathers , which debarred not the sons from their succession : or that so many ages had been delivered over to hell , and so many reserved for heaven ; and that the devil had the first choice , and God the next . Truly I am apt to think , that the revealed religion which was taught by Noah to all his sons , might continue for some ages in the whole posterity . That afterwards it was included wholly in the family of Shem is manifest ; but when the progenies of Ham and Japhet swarmed into colonies , and those colonies were subdivided into many others , in process of time their descendants lost by little and little the primitive and purer rites of divine worship , retaining only the notion of one Deity ; to which succeeding generations added others : for men took their degrees in those ages from conquerors to gods . Revelation being thus eclipsed to almost all mankind , the light of nature , as the next in dignity , was substituted ; and that is it which St Paul concludes to be the rule of the heathens , and by which they are hereafter to be judged . If my supposition be true , then the consequence which I have assumed in my poem may be also true ; namely , that Deism , or the principles of natural worship , are only the faint remnants or dying flames of revealed religion in the posterity of Noah : and that our modern philosophers — nay , and some of our philosophising divines — have too much exalted the faculties of our souls , when they have maintained that by their force mankind has been able to find out that there is one supreme agent or intellectual Being which we call God : that praise and prayer are his due worship ; and the rest of those deducements , which I am confident are the remote effects of revelation , and unattainable by our discourse , I mean as simply considered , and without the benefit of divine illumination . So that we have not lifted up ourselves to God , by the weak pinions of our reason , but he has been pleased to descend to us ; and what Socrates said of him , what Plato writ , and the rest of the heathen philosophers of several nations , is all no more than the twilight of revelation , after the sun of it was set in the race of Noah . That there is something above us , some principle of motion , our reason can apprehend , though it cannot discover what it is by its own virtue . And , indeed , it is very improbable , that we , who by the strength of our faculties cannot enter into the knowledge of any Being , not so much as of our own , should be able to find out by them , that supreme nature , which we cannot otherwise define than by saying it is infinite ; as if infinite were definable , or infinity a subject for our narrow understanding . They who would prove religion by reason , do but weaken the cause which they endeavour to support : it is to take away the pillars from our faith , and to prop it only with a twig ; it is to design a tower like that of Babel , which , if it were possible , as it is not , to reach heaven , would come to nothing by the confusion of the workmen . For every man is building a several way ; impotently conceited of his own model and his own materials : reason is always striving , and always at a loss ; and of necessity it must so come to pass , while it is exercised about that which is not its own proper object . Let us be content at last to know God by his own methods ; at least , so much of him as he is pleased to reveal to us in the sacred Scriptures : to apprehend them to be the Word of God is all our reason has to do ; for all beyond it is the work of faith , which is the seal of Heaven impressed upon our human understanding .</p>
   <p>And now for what concerns the holy bishop Athanasius ; the preface of whose creed seems inconsistent with my opinion ; which is , that heathens may possibly be saved . In the first place , I desire it may be considered that it is the preface only , not the creed itself , which , till I am better informed , is of too hard a digestion for my charity . It is not that I am ignorant how many several texts of Scripture seemingly support that cause ; but neither am I ignorant how all those texts may receive a kinder and more mollified interpretation . Every man who is read in Church history , knows that belief was drawn up after a long contestation with Arius , concerning the divinity of our blessed Saviour , and his being one substance with the Father ; and that thus compiled , it was sent abroad among the Christian Churches , as a kind of test , which whosoever took was looked upon as an orthodox believer . It is manifest from hence , that the heathen part of the empire was not concerned in it ; for its business was not to distinguish betwixt Pagans and Christians , but betwixt Heretics and true Believers . This , well considered , takes off the heavy weight of censure , which I would willingly avoid , from so venerable a man ; for if this proportion , “ whosoever will be saved , ” be restrained only to those to whom it was intended , and for whom it was composed , I mean the Christians ; then the anathema reaches not the heathens , who had never heard of Christ , and were nothing interested in that dispute . After all , I am far from blaming even that prefatory addition to the creed , and as far from cavilling at the continuation of it in the Liturgy of the Church , where , on the days appointed , it is publicly read : for I suppose there is the same reason for it now , in opposition to the Socinians , as there was then against the Arians ; the one being a heresy , which seems to have been refined out of the other ; and with how much more plausibility of reason it combats our religion , with so much more caution it ought to be avoided : therefore the prudence of our Church is to be commended , which has interposed her authority for the recommendation of this creed . Yet to such as are grounded in the true belief , those explanatory creeds , the Nicene and this of Athanasius , might perhaps be spared ; for what is supernatural will always be a mystery , in spite of exposition ; and for my own part , the plain Apostles ’ creed is most suitable to my weak understanding , as the simplest diet is the most easy of digestion .</p>
   <p>I have dwelt longer on this subject than I intended , and longer than perhaps I ought ; for having laid down , as my foundation , that the Scripture is a rule ; that in all things needful to salvation it is clear , sufficient , and ordained by God Almighty for that purpose , I have left myself no right to interpret obscure places , such as concern the possibility of eternal happiness to heathens : because whatsoever is obscure is concluded not necessary to be known .</p>
   <p>But , by asserting the Scripture to be the canon of oar faith , I have unavoidably created to myself two sorts of enemies : the Papists indeed , more directly , because they have kept the Scriptures from us what they could ; and have reserved to themselves a right of interpreting what they have delivered under the pretence of infallibility : and the Fanatics more collaterally , because they have assumed what amounts to an infallibility , in the private spirit ; and have detorted those texts of Scripture which are not necessary to salvation , to the damnable uses of sedition , disturbance , and destruction of the civil government . To begin with the Papists , and to speak freely , I think them the less dangerous , at least in appearance to our present state ; for not only the penal laws are in force against them , and their number is contemptible , but also their peers and commons are excluded from parliament , and consequently those laws in no probability of being repealed . A general and uninterrupted plot of their clergy , ever since the Reformation , I suppose all Protestants believe ; for it is not reasonable to think but that so many of their orders , as were outed from their fat possessions , would endeavour a re-entrance against those whom they account heretics . As for the late design , Mr Coleman 's letters , for aught I know , are the best evidence ; and what they discover , without wiredrawing their sense , or malicious glosses , all men of reason conclude credible . If there be anything more than this required of me , I must believe it as well as I am able , in spite of the witnesses , and out of a decent conformity to the votes of parliament ; for I suppose the Fanatics will not allow the private spirit in this case . Here the infallibility is at least in one part of the government ; and our understandings as well as our wills are represented . But to return to the Roman Catholics , how can we be secure from the practice of Jesuited Papists in that religion ? For not two or three of that order , as some of them would impose upon us , but almost the whole body of them are of opinion , that their infallible master has a right over kings , not only in spirituals but temporals . Not to name Mariana , Bellarmine , Emanuel Sa , Molina , Santare , Simancha ,<span corresp="#note85" type="note_anchor">[ 85 ]</span>and at least twenty others of foreign countries ; we can produce of our own nation , Campian , and Doleman or Parsons ; besides , many are named whom I have not read , who all of them attest this doctrine , that the pope can depose and give away the right of any sovereign prince , si vel paulum deflexerit , if he shall never so little warp : but if he once comes to be excommunicated , then the bond of obedience is taken off from subjects ; and they may , and ought to drive him , like another Nebuchadnezzar , ex hominum Christianorum dominatu , from exercising dominion over Christians ; and to this they are bound by virtue of divine precept , and by all the ties of conscience , under no less penalty than damnation . If they answer me , as a learned priest has lately written , that this doctrine of the Jesuits is not de fide ; and that consequently they are not obliged by it , they must pardon me , if I think they have said nothing to the purpose ; for it is a maxim in their church , where points of faith are not decided , and that doctors are of contrary opinions , they may follow which part they please ; but more safely the most received and most authorised . And their champion Bellarmine has told the world , in his Apology , that the king of England is a vassal to the pope , ratione directi domini , and that he holds in villanage of his Roman landlord : which is no new claim put in for England . Our chronicles are his authentic witnesses , that King John was deposed by the same plea , and Philip Augustus admitted tenant . And which makes the more for Bellarmine , the French king was again ejected when our king submitted to the church , and the crown was received under the sordid condition of a vassalage .</p>
   <p>It is not sufficient for the more moderate and well-meaning Papists , of which I doubt not there are many , to produce the evidences of their loyalty to the late king , and to declare their innocency in this plot : I will grant their behaviour in the first to have been as loyal and as brave as they desire ; and will be willing to hold them excused as to the second , I mean when it comes to my turn , and after my betters ; for it is a madness to be sober alone , while the nation continues drank : but that saying of their father Cres . is still running in my head , that they may be dispensed with in their obedience to an heretic prince , while the necessity of the times shall oblige them to it : for that , as another of them tells us , is only the effect of Christian prudence ; but when once they shall get power to shake him off , an heretic is no lawful king , and consequently to rise against him is no rebellion . I should be glad , therefore , that they would follow the advice which was charitably given them by a reverend prelate of our church ; namely , that they would join in a public act of disowning and detesting those Jesuitic principles ; and subscribe to all doctrines which deny the pope 's authority of deposing kings , and releasing subjects from their oath of allegiance : to which I should think they might easily be induced , if it be true that this present pope has condemned the doctrine of king-killing , a thesis of the Jesuits maintained , amongst others , ex cathedra , as they call it , or in open consistory .</p>
   <p>Leaving them , therefore , in so fair a way , if they please themselves , of satisfying all reasonable men of their sincerity and good meaning to the government , I shall make bold to consider that other extreme of our religion — I mean the Fanatics , or Schismatics , of the English Church . Since the Bible has been translated into our tongue , they have used it so , as if their business was not to be saved , but to be damned by its contents . If we consider only them , better had it been for the English nation that it had still remained in the original Greek and Hebrew , or at least in the honest Latin of St Jerome , than that several texts in it should have been prevaricated , to the destruction of that government which put it into so ungrateful hands .</p>
   <p>How many heresies the first translation of Tindal produced in few years , let my Lord Herbert 's history of Henry VIII . inform you ; insomuch , that for the gross errors in it , and the great mischiefs it occasioned , a sentence passed on the first edition of the Bible , too shameful almost to be repeated . After the short reign of Edward VI ., who had continued to carry on the Reformation on other principles than it was begun , every one knows that not only the chief promoters of that work , but many others , whose consciences would not dispense with Popery , were forced , for fear of persecution , to change climates : from whence returning at the beginning of Queen Elizabeth 's reign , many of them who had been in France , and at Geneva , brought back the rigid opinions and imperious discipline of Calvin , to graft upon our Reformation : which , though they cunningly concealed at first , as well knowing how nauseously that drug would go down in a lawful monarchy , which was prescribed for a rebellious commonwealth , yet they always kept it in reserve ; and were never wanting to themselves either in court or parliament , when either they had any prospect of a numerous party of fanatic members of the one , or the encouragement of any favourite in the other , whose covetousness was gaping at the patrimony of the Church . They who will consult the works of our venerable Hooker , or the account of his life , or more particularly the letter written to him on this subject by George Cranmer , may see by what gradations they proceeded : from the dislike of cap and surplice , the very next step was admonitions to the parliament against the whole government ecclesiastical : then came out volumes in English and Latin in defence of their tenets : and immediately practices were set on foot to erect their discipline without authority . Those not succeeding , satire and railing was the next : and Martin Mar-prelate , the Marvel of those times , was the first Presbyterian scribbler , who sanctified libels and scurrility to the use of the good old cause : which was done , says my author , upon this account ; that their serious treatises having been fully answered and refuted , they might compass by railing what they had lost by reasoning ; and , when their cause was sunk in court and parliament , they might at least hedge in a stake amongst the rabble : for to their ignorance all things are wit which are abusive ; but if Church and State were made the theme , then the doctoral degree of wit was to be taken at Billingsgate : even the most saint-like of the party , though they durst not excuse this contempt and vilifying of the government , yet were pleased , and grinned at it with a pious smile ; and called it a judgment of God against the hierarchy . Thus sectaries , we may see , were born with teeth , foul-mouthed and scurrilous from their infancy : and if spiritual pride , venom , violence , contempt of superiors , and slander , had been the marks of orthodox belief , the presbytery and the rest of our schismatics , which are their spawn , were always the most visible church in the Christian world .</p>
   <p>It is true , the government was too strong at that time for a rebellion ; but , to show what proficiency they had made in Calvin 's school , even then their mouths watered at it : for two of their gifted brotherhood , Hacket<span corresp="#note86" type="note_anchor">[ 86 ]</span>and Coppinger , as the story tells us , got up into a pease-cart and harangue the people , to dispose them to an insurrection , and to establish their discipline by force : so that however it comes about , that now they celebrate Queen Elizabeth 's birth-night as that of their saint and patroness ; yet then they were for doing the work of the Lord by arms against her ; and in all probability they wanted but a fanatic lord mayor and two sheriffs of their party to have compassed it .</p>
   <p>Our venerable Hooker , after many admonitions which he had given them , towards the end of his preface breaks out into this prophetic speech :— “ There is in every one of these considerations most just cause to fear , lest our hastiness to embrace a thing of so perilous consequence ( meaning the Presbyterian discipline ) should cause posterity to feel those evils , which as yet are more easy for us to prevent , than they would be for them to remedy . ”</p>
   <p>How fatally this Cassandra has foretold , we know too well by sad experience : the seeds were sown in the time of Queen Elizabeth , the bloody harvest ripened in the reign of King Charles the Martyr ; and , because all the sheaves could not be carried off without shedding some of the loose grains , another crop is too like to follow ; nay , I fear it is unavoidable , if the conventiclers be permitted still to scatter .</p>
   <p>A man may be suffered to quote an adversary to our religion , when he speaks truth ; and it is the observation of Maimbourg , in his “ History of Calvinism , ” that wherever that discipline was planted and embraced , rebellion , civil war , and misery attended it . And how , indeed , should it happen otherwise ? Reformation of Church and State has always been the ground of our divisions in England . While we were Papists , our holy father rid us , by pretending authority out of the Scriptures to depose princes ; when we shook off his authority , the sectaries furnished themselves with the same weapons , and out of the same magazine , the Bible ; so that the Scriptures , which are in themselves the greatest security of governors , as commanding express obedience to them , are now turned to their destruction ; and never since the Reformation has there wanted a text of their interpreting to authorise a rebel . And it is to be noted , by the way , that the doctrines of king-killing and deposing , which have been taken up only by the worst party of the Papists , the most frontless flatterers of the pope 's authority , have been espoused , defended , and are still maintained by the whole body of nonconformists and republicans . It is but dubbing themselves the people of God , which it is the interest of their preachers to tell them they are , and their own interest to believe ; and , after that , they cannot dip into the Bible , but one text or another will turn up for their purpose : if they are under persecution , as they call it , then that is a mark of their election ; if they flourish , then God works miracles for their deliverance , and the saints are to possess the earth .</p>
   <p>They may think themselves to be too roughly handled in this paper ; but I , who know best how far I could have gone on this subject , must be bold to tell them they are spared : though at the same time I am not ignorant that they interpret the mildness of a writer to them , as they do the mercy of the government ; in the one they think it fear , and conclude it weakness in the other . The best way for them to confute me is , as I before advised the Papists , to disclaim their principles and renounce their practices . We shall all be glad to think them true Englishmen when they obey the king , and true Protestants when they conform to the church discipline .</p>
   <p>It remains that I acquaint the reader , that these verses were written for an ingenious young gentleman ,<span corresp="#note87" type="note_anchor">[ 87 ]</span>my friend , upon his translation of “ The Critical History of the Old Testament , ” composed by the learned Father Simon : the verses , therefore , are addressed to the translator of that work , and the style of them is , what it ought to be , epistolary .</p>
   <p>If any one be so lamentable a critic as to require the smoothness , the numbers , and the turn of heroic poetry in this poem , I must tell him , that if he has not read Horace , I have studied him , and hope the style of his epistles is not ill imitated here . The expressions of a poem designed purely for instruction , ought to be plain and natural , and yet majestic : for here the poet is presumed to be a kind of lawgiver , and those three qualities which I have named , are proper to the legislative style . The florid , elevated , and figurative way is for the passions ; for love and hatred , fear and anger , are begotten in the soul , by showing their objects out of their true proportion , either greater than the life or less : but instruction is to be given by showing them what they naturally are . A man is to be cheated into passion , but to be reasoned into truth .</p>

   <p>THE HIND AND THE PANTHER .</p>
   <p>A POEM , IN THREE PARTS .</p>
   <p>— Antiquam exquirite matrem . Et vera incessa patuit Dea . VIRG .</p>
   <p>PREFACE .</p>
   <p>The nation is in too high a ferment for me to expect either fair war , or even so much as fair quarter , from a reader of the opposite party . All men are engaged either on this side or that ; and though conscience is the common word , which is given by both , yet if a writer fall among enemies , and cannot give the marks of their conscience , he is knocked down before the reasons of his own are heard . A preface , therefore , which is but a bespeaking of favour , is altogether useless . What I desire the reader should know concerning me , he will find in the body of the poem , if he have but the patience to peruse it . Only this advertisement let him take beforehand , which relates to the merits of the cause . No general characters of parties ( call them either Sects or Churches ) can be so fully and exactly drawn , as to comprehend all the several members of them ; at least all such as are received under that denomination . For example , there are some of the Church by law established , who envy not liberty of conscience to Dissenters , as being well satisfied that , according to their own principles , they ought not to persecute them . Yet these , by reason of their fewness , I could not distinguish from the numbers of the rest , with whom they are embodied in one common name . On the other side , there are many of our sects , and more indeed than I could reasonably have hoped , who have withdrawn themselves from the communion of the Panther , and embraced this gracious indulgence of his Majesty in point of toleration . But neither to the one nor the other of these is this satire any way intended : it is aimed only at the refractory and disobedient on either side . For those who are come over to the royal party are consequently supposed to be out of gun-shot . Our physicians have observed , that , in process of time , some diseases have abated of their virulence , and have in a manner worn out their malignity , so as to be no longer mortal ; and why may not I suppose the same concerning some of those who have formerly been enemies to kingly government , as well as Catholic religion ? I hope they have now another notion of both , as having found , by comfortable experience , that the doctrine of persecution is far from being an article of our faith .</p>
   <p>It is not for any private man to censure the proceedings of a foreign prince ; but , without suspicion of flattery , I may praise our own , who has taken contrary measures , and those more suitable to the spirit of Christianity . Some of the Dissenters , in their addresses to his Majesty , have said , “ that he has restored God to his empire over conscience . ” I confess I dare not stretch the figure to so great a boldness ; but I may safely say , that conscience is the royalty and prerogative of every private man . He is absolute in his own breast , and accountable to no earthly power , for that which passes only betwixt God and him . Those who are driven into the fold are , generally speaking , rather made hypocrites than converts .</p>
   <p>This indulgence being granted to all the sects , it ought in reason to be expected , that they should both receive it , and receive it thankfully . For , at this time of day , to refuse the benefit , and adhere to those whom they have esteemed their persecutors , what is it else , but publicly to own , that they suffered not before for conscience-sake , but only out of pride and obstinacy , to separate from a church for those impositions , which they now judge may be lawfully obeyed ? After they have so long contended for their classical ordination ( not to speak of rites and ceremonies ) will they at length submit to an episcopal ? If they can go so far , out of complaisance to their old enemies , methinks a little reason should persuade them to take another step , and see whither that would lead them .</p>
   <p>Of the receiving this toleration thankfully I shall say no more , than that they ought , and I doubt not they will consider from what hand they received it . It is not from a Cyrus , a heathen prince , and a foreigner , but from a Christian king , their native sovereign ; who expects a return in specie from them , that the kindness , which he has graciously shown them , may be retaliated on those of his own persuasion .</p>
   <p>As for the poem in general , I will only thus far satisfy the reader , that it was neither imposed on me , nor so much as the subject given me by any man . It was written during the last winter , and the beginning of this spring ; though with long interruptions of ill health and other hindrances . About a fortnight before I had finished it , his Majesty 's declaration for liberty of conscience came abroad ; which , if I had so soon expected , I might have spared myself the labour of writing many things which are contained in the third part of it . But I was always in some hope , that the Church of England might have been persuaded to have taken off the penal laws and the test , which was one design of the poem , when I proposed to myself the writing of it .</p>
   <p>It is evident that some part of it was only occasional , and not first intended : I mean that defence of myself , to which every honest man is bound , when he is injuriously attacked in print ; and I refer myself to the judgment of those who have read the Answer to the Defence of the late King 's Papers , and that of the Duchess ( in which last I was concerned ) , how charitably I have been represented there . I am now informed both of the author and supervisors of this pamphlet , and will reply , when I think he can affront me ; for I am of Socrates 's opinion , that all creatures cannot . In the mean time let him consider whether he deserved not a more severe reprehension than I gave him formerly , for using so little respect to the memory of those whom he pretended to answer ; and at his leisure , look out for some original treatise of humility , written by any Protestant in English ; I believe I may say in any other tongue : for the magnified piece of Duncomb on that subject , which either he must mean , or none , and with which another of his fellows has upbraided me , was translated from the Spanish of Rodriguez ; though with the omission of the seventeenth , the twenty-fourth , the twenty-fifth , and the last chapter , which will be found in comparing of the books .</p>
   <p>He would have insinuated to the world , that her late Highness died not a Roman Catholic . He declares himself to be now satisfied to the contrary , in which he has given up the cause ; for matter of fact was the principal debate betwixt us . In the mean time , he would dispute the motives of her change ; how preposterously , let all men judge , when he seemed to deny the subject of the controversy , the change itself . And because I would not take up this ridiculous challenge , he tells the world I cannot argue : but he may as well infer , that a Catholic cannot fast , because he will not take up the cudgels against Mrs James , to confute the Protestant religion .</p>
   <p>I have but one word more to say concerning the poem as such , and abstracting from the matters , either religious or civil , which are handled in it . The first part , consisting most in general characters and narration , I have endeavoured to raise , and give it the majestic turn of heroic poesy . The second being matter of dispute , and chiefly concerning Church authority , I was obliged to make as plain and perspicuous as possibly I could ; yet not wholly neglecting the numbers , though I had not frequent occasions for the magnificence of verse . The third , which has more of the nature of domestic conversation , is , or ought to be , more free and familiar than the two former .</p>
   <p>There are in it two episodes , or fables , which are interwoven with the main design ; so that they are properly parts of it , though they are also distinct stories of themselves . In both of these I have made use of the commonplaces of satire , whether true or false , which are urged by the members of the one Church against the other : at which I hope no reader of either party will be scandalized , because they are not of my invention , but as old , to my knowledge , as the times of Boccace and Chaucer on the one side , and as those of the Reformation on the other .</p>

     <l n="1">A milk-white Hind , immortal and unchanged ,</l>
     <l n="2">Fed on the lawns , and in the forest ranged ;</l>
     <l n="3">Without unspotted , innocent within ,</l>
     <l n="4">She fear 'd no danger , for she knew no sin .</l>
     <l n="5">Yet had she oft been chased with horns and hounds ,</l>
     <l n="6">And Scythian shafts ; and many winged wounds</l>
     <l n="7">Aim 'd at her heart ; was often forced to fly ,</l>
     <l n="8">And doom 'd to death , though fated not to die .</l>

     <l n="9">Not so her young ; for their unequal line</l>
     <l n="10">Was hero 's make , half human , half divine . 10</l>
     <l n="11">Their earthly mould obnoxious was to fate ,</l>
     <l n="12">The immortal part assumed immortal state .</l>
     <l n="13">Of these a slaughter 'd army lay in blood ,</l>
     <l n="14">Extended o'er the Caledonian wood ,</l>
     <l n="15">Their native walk ; whose vocal blood arose ,</l>
     <l n="16">And cried for pardon on their perjured foes .</l>
     <l n="17">Their fate was fruitful , and the sanguine seed ,</l>
     <l n="18">Endued with souls , increased the sacred breed .</l>
     <l n="19">So captive Israel multiplied in chains ,</l>
     <l n="20">A numerous exile , and enjoy 'd her pains . 20</l>
     <l n="21">With grief and gladness mix 'd , the mother view 'd</l>
     <l n="22">Her martyr 'd offspring , and their race renew 'd ;</l>
     <l n="23">Their corpse to perish , but their kind to last ,</l>
     <l n="24">So much the deathless plant the dying fruit surpass 'd .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="25">Panting and pensive now she ranged alone ,</l>

     <l n="27">The common hunt , though from their rage restrain 'd</l>
     <l n="28">By sovereign power , her company disdain 'd ;</l>
     <l n="29">Grinn 'd as they pass 'd , and with a glaring eye</l>

     <l n="43">The bristled Baptist Boar , impure as he ,</l>
     <l n="44">But whiten 'd with the foam of sanctity ,</l>

     <l n="46">And mountains levell 'd in his furious race ;</l>

     <l n="50">With broken tusks , and with a borrow 'd name ; 50</l>
     <l n="51">He shunn 'd the vengeance , and conceal 'd the shame :</l>

     <l n="4">With expert huntsmen was encompass 'd round ;</l>
     <l n="5">The enclosure narrow 'd ; the sagacious power 5</l>

     <l n="9">As sacrifices on their altar laid ;</l>
     <l n="10">While you , their careful mother , wisely fled , 10</l>
     <l n="11">Not trusting destiny to save your head ;</l>
     <l n="12">For , whate'er promises you have applied</l>
     <l n="13">To your unfailing Church , the surer side</l>

     <l n="23">Howe'er you take it now , the common cry</l>
     <l n="24">Then ran you down for your rank loyalty .</l>
     <l n="25">Besides , in Popery they thought you nursed ,</l>
     <l n="26">As evil tongues will ever speak the worst ,</l>
     <l n="27">Because some forms , and ceremonies some</l>
     <l n="28">You kept , and stood in the main question dumb .</l>

     <l n="33">After long fencing push 'd against the wall .</l>
     <l n="34">Your salvo comes , that he 's not there at all :</l>
     <l n="35">There changed your faith , and what may change may fall .</l>

     <l n="41">Yet in your sense I never own 'd it there .</l>
     <l n="42">A real virtue we by faith receive ,</l>
     <l n="43">And that we in the sacrament believe .</l>
     <l n="44">Then , said the Hind , as you the matter state ,</l>
     <l n="45">Not only Jesuits can equivocate ;</l>
     <l n="46">For real , as you now the word expound ,</l>
     <l n="47">From solid substance dwindles to a sound .</l>
     <l n="48">Methinks an Æsop 's fable you repeat ;</l>
     <l n="49">You know who took the shadow for the meat :</l>
     <l n="50">Your Church 's substance thus you change at will , 50</l>
     <l n="51">And yet retain your former figure still .</l>
     <l n="52">I freely grant you spoke to save your life ;</l>
     <l n="53">For then you lay beneath the butcher 's knife .</l>
     <l n="54">Long time you fought , redoubled battery bore ,</l>

     <l n="56">Your former self : for every hour your form</l>
     <l n="57">Is chopp 'd and changed , like winds before a storm .</l>
     <l n="58">Thus fear and interest will prevail with some ;</l>

     <l n="60">The Panther grinn 'd at this , and thus replied : 60</l>

     <l n="63">The canon , dame , is levell 'd full at you .</l>

     <l n="66">Is he from Heaven , this mighty champion , come ;</l>
     <l n="67">Or lodged below in subterranean Rome ?</l>
     <l n="68">First , seat him somewhere , and derive his race ,</l>

     <l n="70">Suppose ( though I disown it ) , said the Hind , 70</l>
     <l n="71">The certain mansion were not yet assign 'd ;</l>
     <l n="72">The doubtful residence no proof can bring</l>
     <l n="73">Against the plain existence of the thing .</l>
     <l n="74">Because philosophers may disagree</l>

     <l n="76">Shall it be thence inferr 'd , I do not see ?</l>
     <l n="77">But you require an answer positive ,</l>

     <l n="79">For fallacies in universals live .</l>
     <l n="80">I then affirm that this unfailing guide 80</l>
     <l n="81">In Pope and General Councils must reside ;</l>
     <l n="82">Both lawful , both combined : what one decrees</l>
     <l n="83">By numerous votes , the other ratifies :</l>
     <l n="84">On this undoubted sense the Church relies .</l>
     <l n="85">‘ Tis true , some doctors in a scantier space ,</l>

     <l n="88">The Church 's after-acceptation join .</l>
     <l n="89">This last circumference appears too wide ;</l>
     <l n="90">The Church diffused is by the Council tied ; 90</l>
     <l n="91">As members by their representatives</l>
     <l n="92">Obliged to laws which Prince and Senate gives .</l>
     <l n="93">Thus some contract , and some enlarge the space :</l>
     <l n="94">In Pope and Council , who denies the place ,</l>
     <l n="95">Assisted from above with God 's unfailing grace ?</l>
     <l n="96">Those canons all the needful points contain ;</l>
     <l n="97">Their sense so obvious , and their words so plain ,</l>
     <l n="98">That no disputes about the doubtful text</l>
     <l n="99">Have hitherto the labouring world perplex 'd .</l>
     <l n="100">If any should in after-times appear , 100</l>
     <l n="101">New Councils must be call 'd , to make the meaning clear :</l>
     <l n="102">Because in them the power supreme resides ;</l>
     <l n="103">And all the promises are to the guides .</l>
     <l n="104">This may be taught with sound and safe defence ;</l>
     <l n="105">But mark how sandy is your own pretence ,</l>
     <l n="106">Who , setting Councils , Pope , and Church aside ,</l>
     <l n="107">Are every man his own presuming guide .</l>
     <l n="108">The Sacred Books , you say , are full and plain .</l>
     <l n="109">And every needful point of truth contain :</l>
     <l n="110">All who can read interpreters may be : 110</l>
     <l n="111">Thus , though your several Churches disagree ,</l>
     <l n="112">Yet every saint has to himself alone</l>
     <l n="113">The secret of this philosophic stone .</l>
     <l n="114">These principles your jarring sects unite ,</l>
     <l n="115">When differing doctors and disciples fight .</l>
     <l n="116">Though Luther , Zuinglius , Calvin , holy chiefs ,</l>
     <l n="117">Have made a battle royal of beliefs ;</l>
     <l n="118">Or , like wild horses , several ways have whirl 'd</l>
     <l n="119">The tortured text about the Christian world ;</l>
     <l n="120">Each Jehu lashing on with furious force , 120</l>
     <l n="121">That Turk or Jew could not have used it worse ;</l>
     <l n="122">No matter what dissension leaders make ,</l>

     <l n="124">Ruled by the Scripture and his own advice ,</l>

     <l n="321">A prophet graved the text , an angel held his hand .</l>

     <l n="328">Yet still their absent flock their pains did share ;</l>

     <l n="330">And , as mistakes arose , or discords fell , 330</l>
     <l n="331">Or bold seducers taught them to rebel ,</l>
     <l n="332">As charity grew cold , or faction hot ,</l>
     <l n="333">Or long neglect their lessons had forgot ,</l>
     <l n="334">For all their wants they wisely did provide ,</l>

     <l n="341">All needful doctrines , are those doctrines plain .</l>

     <l n="343">They writ but seldom , but they daily taught .</l>
     <l n="344">And what one saint has said of holy Paul ,</l>

     <l n="346">For this obscurity could Heaven provide</l>
