    <head>VIRG .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">While others sing the fortune of the great ;</l>
     <l n="2">Empire and arms , and all the pomp of state ;</l>
     <l n="3">With Britain ’ s hero ( 1 ) set their souls on fire ,</l>
     <l n="4">And grow immortal as his deeds inspire ;</l>
     <l n="5">I draw a deeper scene : a scene that yields</l>
     <l n="6">A louder trumpet , and more dreadful fields ;</l>
     <l n="7">The world alarm ’ d , both earth and heaven o ’ erthrown ,</l>
     <l n="8">And gasping nature ’ s last tremendous groan ;</l>
     <l n="9">Death ’ s ancient sceptre broke , the teeming tomb ,</l>
     <l n="10">The righteous Judge , and man ’ s eternal doom .</l>
     <l n="11">’ Twixt joy and pain I view the bold design ,</l>
     <l n="12">And ask my anxious heart , if it be mine .</l>
     <l n="13">Whatever great or dreadful has been done</l>
     <l n="14">Within the sight of conscious stars or sun ,</l>
     <l n="15">Is far beneath my daring : I look down</l>
     <l n="16">On all the splendours of the British crown .</l>
     <l n="17">This globe is for my verse a narrow bound ;</l>
     <l n="18">Attend me , all the glorious worlds around !</l>
     <l n="19">O ! all ye angels , howsoe ’ er disjoin ’ d ,</l>
     <l n="20">Of every various order , place , and kind ,</l>
     <l n="21">Hear , and assist , a feeble mortal ’ s lays ;</l>
     <l n="22">’ Tis your Eternal King I strive to praise .</l>
     <l n="23">But chiefly thou , great Ruler ! Lord of all !</l>
     <l n="24">Before whose throne archangels prostrate fall ;</l>
     <l n="25">If at thy nod , from discord , and from night ,</l>
     <l n="26">Sprang beauty , and yon sparkling worlds of light ,</l>
     <l n="27">Exalt e ’ en me ; all inward tumults quell ;</l>
     <l n="28">The clouds and darkness of my mind dispel ;</l>
     <l n="29">To my great subject thou my breast inspire ,</l>
     <l n="30">And raise my lab ’ ring soul with equal fire .</l>
     <l n="31">Man , bear thy brow aloft , view every grace</l>
     <l n="32">In God ’ s great offspring , beauteous nature ’ s face :</l>
     <l n="33">See spring ’ s gay bloom ; see golden autumn ’ s store ;</l>
     <l n="34">See how earth smiles , and hear old ocean roar .</l>
     <l n="35">Leviathans but heave their cumbrous mail ,</l>
     <l n="36">It makes a tide , and wind-bound navies sail .</l>
     <l n="37">Here , forests rise , the mountains awful pride ;</l>
     <l n="38">Here , rivers measure climes , and worlds divide ;</l>
     <l n="39">There , valleys fraught with gold ’ s resplendent seeds ,</l>
     <l n="40">Hold kings , and kingdoms ’ fortunes , in their beds :</l>
     <l n="41">There , to the skies , aspiring hills ascend ,</l>
     <l n="42">And into distant lands their shades extend .</l>
     <l n="43">View cities , armies , fleets ; of fleets the pride ,</l>
     <l n="44">See Europe ’ s law , in Albion ’ s channel ride .</l>
     <l n="45">View the whole earth ’ s vast landscape unconfin ’ d ,</l>
     <l n="46">Or view in Britain all her glories join ’ d .</l>
     <l n="47">Then let the firmament thy wonder raise ;</l>
     <l n="48">’ Twill raise thy wonder , but transcend thy praise .</l>
     <l n="49">How far from east to west ? the lab ’ ring eye</l>
     <l n="50">Can scarce the distant azure bounds descry :</l>
     <l n="51">Wide theatre ! where tempests play at large ,</l>
     <l n="52">And God ’ s right hand can all its wrath discharge .</l>
     <l n="53">Mark how those radiant lamps inflame the pole ,</l>
     <l n="54">Call forth the seasons , and the year control :</l>
     <l n="55">They shine thro ’ time , with an unalter ’ d ray :</l>
     <l n="56">See this grand period rise , and that decay :</l>
     <l n="57">So vast , this world ’ s a grain ; yet myriads grace ,</l>
     <l n="58">With golden pomp , the throng ’ d ethereal space ;</l>
     <l n="59">So bright , with such a wealth of glory stor ’ d ,</l>
     <l n="60">’ Twere sin in heathens not to have ador ’ d .</l>
     <l n="61">How great , how firm , how sacred , all appears !</l>
     <l n="62">How worthy an immortal round of years !</l>
     <l n="63">Yet all must drop , as autumn ’ s sickliest grain ,</l>
     <l n="64">And earth and firmament be sought in vain :</l>
     <l n="65">The tract forgot where constellations shone ,</l>
     <l n="66">Or where the Stuarts fill ’ d an awful throne :</l>
     <l n="67">Time shall be slain , all nature be destroy ’ d ,</l>
     <l n="68">Nor leave an atom in the mighty void .</l>
     <l n="69">Sooner , or later , in some future date ,</l>
     <l n="70">( A dreadful secret in the book of fate ! )</l>
     <l n="71">This hour , for aught all human wisdom knows ,</l>
     <l n="72">Or when ten thousand harvests more have rose ;</l>
     <l n="73">When scenes are chang ’ d on this revolving earth ,</l>
     <l n="74">Old empires fall , and give new empires birth ;</l>
     <l n="75">While other Bourbons rule in other lands ,</l>
     <l n="76">And ( if man ’ s sin forbids not ) other Annes ;</l>
     <l n="77">While the still busy world is treading o ’ er</l>
     <l n="78">The paths they trod five thousand years before ,</l>
     <l n="79">Thoughtless as those who now life ’ s mazes run ,</l>
     <l n="80">Of earth dissolv ’ d , or an extinguish ’ d sun ;</l>
     <l n="81">( Ye sublunary worlds , awake , awake !</l>
     <l n="82">Ye rulers of the nation , hear , and shake ! )</l>
     <l n="83">Thick clouds of darkness shall arise on day ;</l>
     <l n="84">In sudden night all earth ’ s dominions lay ;</l>
     <l n="85">Impetuous winds the scatter ’ d forests rend ;</l>
     <l n="86">Eternal mountains , like their cedars , bend :</l>
     <l n="87">The valleys yawn , the troubled ocean roar ,</l>
     <l n="88">And break the bondage of his wonted shore ;</l>
     <l n="89">A sanguine stain the silver moon o ’ erspread ;</l>
     <l n="90">Darkness the circle of the sun invade ;</l>
     <l n="91">From inmost heaven incessant thunders roll ,</l>
     <l n="92">And the strong echo bound from pole to pole .</l>
     <l n="93">When , lo , a mighty trump , one half conceal ’ d</l>
     <l n="94">In clouds , one half to mortal eye reveal ’ d ,</l>
     <l n="95">Shall pour a dreadful note ; the piercing call</l>
     <l n="96">Shall rattle in the centre of the ball ;</l>
     <l n="97">Th ’ extended circuit of creation shake ,</l>
     <l n="98">The living die with fear , the dead awake .</l>
     <l n="99">Oh powerful blast ! to which no equal sound</l>
     <l n="100">Did e ’ er the frighted ear of nature wound ,</l>
     <l n="101">Tho ’ rival clarions have been strain ’ d on high ,</l>
     <l n="102">And kindled wars immortal thro ’ the sky ,</l>
     <l n="103">Tho ’ God ’ s whole enginery discharg ’ d , and all</l>
     <l n="104">The rebel angels bellow ’ d in their fall .</l>
     <l n="105">Have angels sinn ’ d ? and shall not man beware ?</l>
     <l n="106">How shall a son of earth decline the snare ?</l>
     <l n="107">Not folded arms , and slackness of the mind ,</l>
     <l n="108">Can promise for the safety of mankind :</l>
     <l n="109">None are supinely good : thro ’ care and pain</l>
     <l n="110">And various arts , the steep ascent we gain .</l>
     <l n="111">This is the scene of combat , not of rest ,</l>
     <l n="112">Man ’ s is laborious happiness at best ;</l>
     <l n="113">On this side death his dangers never cease ,</l>
     <l n="114">His joys are joys of conquest , not of peace .</l>
     <l n="115">If then , obsequious to the will of fate ,</l>
     <l n="116">And bending to the terms of human state ,</l>
     <l n="117">When guilty joys invite us to their arms ,</l>
     <l n="118">When beauty smiles , or grandeur spreads her charms ,</l>
     <l n="119">The conscious soul would this great scene display ,</l>
     <l n="120">Call down th ’ immortal hosts in dread array ,</l>
     <l n="121">The trumpet sound , the Christian banner spread ,</l>
     <l n="122">And raise from silent graves the trembling dead ;</l>
     <l n="123">Such deep impression would the picture make ,</l>
     <l n="124">No power on earth her firm resolve could shake ;</l>
     <l n="125">Engag ’ d with angels she would greatly stand ,</l>
     <l n="126">And look regardless down on sea and land ;</l>
     <l n="127">Not proffer ’ d worlds her ardour could restrain ,</l>
     <l n="128">And death might shake his threat ’ ning lance in vain !</l>
     <l n="129">Her certain conquest would endear the sight ,</l>
     <l n="130">And danger serve but to exalt delight .</l>
     <l n="131">Instructed thus to shun the fatal spring ,</l>
     <l n="132">Whence flow the terrors of that day I sing ;</l>
     <l n="133">More boldly we our labours may pursue ,</l>
     <l n="134">And all the dreadful image set to view .</l>
     <l n="135">The sparkling eye , the sleek and painted breast ,</l>
     <l n="136">The burnish ’ d scale , curl ’ d train , and rising crest ,</l>
     <l n="137">All that is lovely in the noxious snake ,</l>
     <l n="138">Provokes our fear , and bids us flee the brake :</l>
     <l n="139">The sting once drawn , his guiltless beauties rise</l>
     <l n="140">In pleasing lustre , and detain our eyes ;</l>
     <l n="141">We view with joy , what once did horror move ,</l>
     <l n="142">And strong aversion softens into love .</l>
     <l n="143">Say then , my muse , whom dismal scenes delight ,</l>
     <l n="144">Frequent at tombs , and in the realms of night ;</l>
     <l n="145">Say , melancholy maid , if bold to dare</l>
     <l n="146">The last extremes of terror and despair ;</l>
     <l n="147">Oh say , what change on earth , what heart in man ,</l>
     <l n="148">This blackest moment since the world began .</l>
     <l n="149">Ah mournful turn ! the blissful earth , who late</l>
     <l n="150">At leisure on her axle roll ’ d in state ;</l>
     <l n="151">While thousand golden planets knew no rest ,</l>
     <l n="152">Still onward in their circling journey prest ;</l>
     <l n="153">A grateful change of seasons some to bring ,</l>
     <l n="154">And sweet vicissitude of fall and spring :</l>
     <l n="155">Some thro ’ vast oceans to conduct the keel ,</l>
     <l n="156">And some those watery worlds to sink , or swell :</l>
     <l n="157">Around her some their splendours to display ,</l>
     <l n="158">And gild her globe with tributary day :</l>
     <l n="159">This world so great , of joy the bright abode ,</l>
     <l n="160">Heaven ’ s darling child , and fav ’ rite of her God ,</l>
     <l n="161">Now looks an exile from her father ’ s care ,</l>
     <l n="162">Deliver ’ d o ’ er to darkness and despair .</l>
     <l n="163">No sun in radiant glory shines on high ;</l>
     <l n="164">No light , but from the terrors of the sky :</l>
     <l n="165">Fall ’ n are her mountains , her fam ’ d rivers lost ,</l>
     <l n="166">And all into a second chaos tost :</l>
     <l n="167">One universal ruin spreads abroad ;</l>
     <l n="168">Nothing is safe beneath the throne of God .</l>
     <l n="169">Such , earth , thy fate : what then canst thou afford</l>
     <l n="170">To comfort and support thy guilty lord ?</l>
     <l n="171">Man , haughty lord of all beneath the moon ,</l>
     <l n="172">How must he bend his soul ’ s ambition down</l>
     <l n="173">Prostrate , the reptile own , and disavow</l>
     <l n="174">His boasted stature , and assuming brow ?</l>
     <l n="175">Claim kindred with the clay , and curse his form ,</l>
     <l n="176">That speaks distinction from his sister worm ?</l>
     <l n="177">What dreadful pangs the trembling heart invade ?</l>
     <l n="178">Lord , why dost thou forsake whom thou hast made ?</l>
     <l n="179">Who can sustain thy anger ? who can stand</l>
     <l n="180">Beneath the terrors of thy lifted hand ?</l>
     <l n="181">It flies the reach of thought ; oh , save me , Power</l>
     <l n="182">Of powers supreme , in that tremendous hour !</l>
     <l n="183">Thou who beneath the frown of fate hast stood ,</l>
     <l n="184">And in thy dreadful agony sweat blood ;</l>
     <l n="185">Thou , who for me , thro ’ every throbbing vein ,</l>
     <l n="186">Hast felt the keenest edge of mortal pain ;</l>
     <l n="187">Whom death led captive thro ’ the realms below ,</l>
     <l n="188">And taught those horrid mysteries of woe ;</l>
     <l n="189">Defend me , O my God ! Oh , save me , Power</l>
     <l n="190">Of powers supreme , in that tremendous hour !</l>
     <l n="191">From east to west they fly , from pole to line ,</l>
     <l n="192">Imploring shelter from the wrath divine ;</l>
     <l n="193">Beg flames to wrap , or whelming seas to sweep ,</l>
     <l n="194">Or rocks to yawn , compassionately deep ;</l>
     <l n="195">Seas cast the monster forth to meet his doom ,</l>
     <l n="196">And rocks but prison up for wrath to come .</l>
     <l n="197">So fares a traitor to an earthly crown ;</l>
     <l n="198">While death sits threat ’ ning in his prince ’ s frown</l>
     <l n="199">His heart ’ s dismay ’ d ; and now his fears command ,</l>
     <l n="200">To change his native for a distant land :</l>
     <l n="201">Swift orders fly , the king ’ s severe decree</l>
     <l n="202">Stands in the channel , and locks up the sea ;</l>
     <l n="203">The port he seeks , obedient to her lord ,</l>
     <l n="204">Hurls back the rebel to his lifted sword .</l>
     <l n="205">But why this idle toil to paint that day ?</l>
     <l n="206">This time elaborately thrown away ?</l>
     <l n="207">Words all in vain pant after the distress ,</l>
     <l n="208">The height of eloquence would make it less ;</l>
     <l n="209">Heavens ! how the good man trembles !—</l>
     <l n="210">And is there a last day ? and must there come</l>
     <l n="211">A sure , a fix ’ d , inexorable doom ?</l>
     <l n="212">Ambition swell , and , thy proud sails to show ,</l>
     <l n="213">Take all the winds that vanity can blow ;</l>
     <l n="214">Wealth on a golden mountain blazing stand ,</l>
     <l n="215">And reach an India forth in either hand ;</l>
     <l n="216">Spread all thy purple clusters , tempting vine ,</l>
     <l n="217">And thou , more dreaded foe , bright beauty , shine ;</l>
     <l n="218">Shine all ; in all your charms together rise ;</l>
     <l n="219">That all , in all your charms , I may despise ;</l>
     <l n="220">While I mount upward on a strong desire ,</l>
     <l n="221">Borne , like Elijah , in a car of fire .</l>
     <l n="222">In hopes of glory to be quite involv ’ d !</l>
     <l n="223">To smile at death ! to long to be dissolv ’ d !</l>
     <l n="224">From our decays a pleasure to receive !</l>
     <l n="225">And kindle into transport at a grave !</l>
     <l n="226">What equals this ? And shall the victor now</l>
     <l n="227">Boast the proud laurels on his loaded brow ?</l>
     <l n="228">Religion ! Oh , thou cherub , heavenly bright !</l>
     <l n="229">Oh , joys unmix ’ d , and fathomless delight !</l>
     <l n="230">Thou , thou art all ; nor find I in the whole</l>
     <l n="231">Creation aught , but God and my own soul .</l>
     <l n="232">For ever , then , my soul , thy God adore ,</l>
     <l n="233">Nor let the brute creation praise him more .</l>
     <l n="234">Shall things inanimate my conduct blame ,</l>
     <l n="235">And flush my conscious cheek with spreading shame ?</l>
     <l n="236">They all for him pursue , or quit , their end</l>

     <l n="240">Nay , the dire monsters that infest the flood ,</l>

     <l n="243">And turn to mild protectors of mankind .</l>
     <l n="244">Did not the prophet this great truth maintain</l>
     <l n="245">In the deep chambers of the gloomy main ;</l>
     <l n="246">When darkness round him all her horrors spread ,</l>
     <l n="247">And the loud ocean bellow ’ d o ’ er his head ?</l>
     <l n="248">When now the thunder roars , the lightning flies ,</l>
     <l n="249">And all the warring winds tumultuous rise ;</l>
     <l n="250">When now the foaming surges , tost on high ,</l>
     <l n="251">Disclose the sands beneath , and touch the sky ;</l>
     <l n="252">When death draws near , the mariners aghast ,</l>
     <l n="253">Look back with terror on their actions past ;</l>
     <l n="254">Their courage sickens into deep dismay ,</l>
     <l n="255">Their hearts , thro ’ fear and anguish , melt away ;</l>
     <l n="256">Nor tears , nor prayers , the tempest can appease ;</l>
     <l n="257">Now they devote their treasure to the seas ;</l>
     <l n="258">Unload their shatter ’ d barque , tho ’ richly fraught ,</l>
     <l n="259">And think the hopes of life are cheaply bought</l>
     <l n="260">With gems and gold ; but oh , the storm so high !</l>
     <l n="261">Nor gems nor gold the hopes of life can buy .</l>
     <l n="262">The trembling prophet then , themselves to save ,</l>
     <l n="263">They headlong plunge into the briny wave ;</l>
     <l n="264">Down he descends , and , booming o ’ er his head ,</l>
     <l n="265">The billows close ; he ’ s number ’ d with the dead .</l>
     <l n="266">( Hear , O ye just ! attend , ye virtuous few !</l>

     <l n="268">Lo ! the great Ruler of the world , from high ,</l>
     <l n="269">Looks smiling down with a propitious eye ,</l>
     <l n="270">Covers his servant with his gracious hand ,</l>
     <l n="271">And bids tempestuous nature silent stand ;</l>
     <l n="272">Commands the peaceful waters to give place ,</l>
     <l n="273">Or kindly fold him in a soft embrace :</l>
     <l n="274">He bridles in the monsters of the deep :</l>
     <l n="275">The bridled monsters awful distance keep :</l>
     <l n="276">Forget their hunger , while they view their prey ;</l>
     <l n="277">And guiltless gaze , and round the stranger play .</l>
     <l n="278">But still arise new wonders ; nature ’ s Lord</l>
     <l n="279">Sends forth into the deep his powerful word ,</l>
     <l n="280">And calls the great leviathan : the great</l>
     <l n="281">Leviathan attends in all his state ;</l>
     <l n="282">Exults for joy , and , with a mighty bound ,</l>
     <l n="283">Makes the sea shake , and heaven and earth resound ;</l>
     <l n="284">Blackens the waters with the rising sand .</l>
     <l n="285">And drives vast billows to the distant land .</l>
     <l n="286">As yawns an earthquake , when imprison ’ d air</l>
     <l n="287">Struggles for vent , and lays the centre bare ,</l>
     <l n="288">The whale expands his jaws ’ enormous size ;</l>
     <l n="289">The prophet views the cavern with surprise ;</l>
     <l n="290">Measures his monstrous teeth , afar descried ,</l>
     <l n="291">And rolls his wond ’ ring eyes from side to side :</l>
     <l n="292">Then takes possession of the spacious seat ,</l>
     <l n="293">And sails secure within the dark retreat .</l>
     <l n="294">Now is he pleas ’ d the northern blast to hear ,</l>
     <l n="295">And hangs on liquid mountains , void of fear ;</l>
     <l n="296">Or falls immers ’ d into the depths below ,</l>
     <l n="297">Where the dead silent waters never flow ;</l>
     <l n="298">To the foundation of the hills convey ’ d ,</l>
     <l n="299">Dwells in the shelving mountain ’ s dreadful shade :</l>
     <l n="300">Where plummet never reach ’ d , he draws his breath ,</l>
     <l n="301">And glides serenely thro ’ the paths of death .</l>
     <l n="302">Two wondrous days and nights thro ’ coral groves ,</l>
     <l n="303">Thro ’ labyrinths of rocks and sands , he roves :</l>
     <l n="304">When the third morning with its level rays</l>
     <l n="305">The mountains gilds , and on the billows plays ,</l>
     <l n="306">It sees the king of waters rise and pour</l>
     <l n="307">His sacred guest uninjur ’ d on the shore :</l>

     <l n="1">The book unfolding ; the resplendent seat</l>
     <l n="2">Of saints and angels ; the tremendous fate</l>
     <l n="3">Of guilty souls ; the gloomy realms of woe ;</l>
     <l n="4">And all the horrors of the world below ;</l>
     <l n="5">I next presume to sing : what yet remains</l>
     <l n="6">Demands my last , but most exalted strains .</l>
     <l n="7">And let the muse or now affect the sky ,</l>
     <l n="8">Or in inglorious shades for ever lie .</l>
     <l n="9">She kindles , she ’ s inflam ’ d so near the goal ;</l>
     <l n="10">She mounts , she gains upon the starry pole ;</l>
     <l n="11">The world grows less as she pursues her flight ,</l>
     <l n="12">And the sun darkens to her distant sight .</l>
     <l n="13">Heaven op ’ ning , all its sacred pomp displays ,</l>
     <l n="14">And overwhelms her with the rushing blaze !</l>
     <l n="15">The triumph rings ! archangels shout around !</l>
     <l n="16">And echoing nature lengthens out the sound !</l>
     <l n="17">Ten thousand trumpets now at once advance ;</l>
     <l n="18">Now deepest silence lulls the vast expanse :</l>
     <l n="19">So deep the silence , and so strong the blast ,</l>
     <l n="20">As nature died , when she had groan ’ d her last .</l>
     <l n="21">Nor man , nor angel , moves ; the Judge on high</l>
     <l n="22">Looks round , and with his glory fills the sky :</l>
     <l n="23">Then on the fatal book his hand he lays ,</l>
     <l n="24">Which high to view supporting seraphs raise ;</l>
     <l n="25">In solemn form the rituals are prepar ’ d ,</l>
     <l n="26">The seal is broken , and a groan is heard .</l>
     <l n="27">And thou , my soul , ( oh fall to sudden pray ’ r ,</l>

     <l n="30">The throng divided falls on either hand ) ;</l>
     <l n="31">How weak , how pale , how haggard , how obscene ,</l>
     <l n="32">What more than death in ev ’ ry face and mien !</l>
     <l n="33">With what distress , and glarings of affright .</l>
     <l n="34">They shock the heart , and turn away the sight !</l>
     <l n="35">In gloomy orbs their trembling eye-balls roll ,</l>
     <l n="36">And tell the horrid secrets of the soul .</l>
     <l n="37">Each gesture mourns , each look is black with care ,</l>
     <l n="38">And ev ’ ry groan is loaden with despair .</l>
     <l n="39">Reader , if guilty , spare the muse , and find</l>
     <l n="40">A truer image pictur ’ d in thy mind .</l>
     <l n="41">Shouldst thou behold thy brother , father , wife ,</l>

     <l n="43">Whose blended int ’ rests levell ’ d at one aim ,</l>
     <l n="44">Whose mix ’ d desires sent up one common flame ,</l>
     <l n="45">Divided far ; thy wretched self alone</l>
     <l n="46">Cast on the left , of all whom thou hast known ;</l>
     <l n="47">How would it wound ! what millions wouldst thou give</l>
     <l n="48">For one more trial , one more day to live !</l>
     <l n="49">Flung back in time an hour , a moment ’ s space ,</l>
     <l n="50">To grasp with eagerness the means of grace ;</l>

     <l n="52">And in that moment to redeem an age ?</l>
     <l n="53">Drive back the tide , suspend a storm in air ,</l>
     <l n="54">Arrest the sun !— but still of this despair .</l>
     <l n="55">Mark , on the right , how amiable a grace !</l>
     <l n="56">Their Maker ’ s image fresh in ev ’ ry face !</l>
     <l n="57">What purple bloom my ravish ’ d soul admires !</l>
     <l n="58">And their eyes sparkling with immortal fires !</l>
     <l n="59">Triumphant beauty ! charms that rise above</l>
     <l n="60">This world , and in blest angels kindle love !</l>
     <l n="61">To the great Judge with holy pride they turn ,</l>
     <l n="62">And dare behold th ’ Almighty ’ s anger burn ;</l>
     <l n="63">Its flash sustain , against its terror rise ,</l>
     <l n="64">And on the dread tribunal fix their eyes .</l>
     <l n="65">Are these the forms that moulder ’ d in the dust ?</l>
     <l n="66">Oh the transcendent glory of the just !</l>
     <l n="67">Yet still some thin remains of fear and doubt ,</l>
     <l n="68">Th ’ infected brightness of their joy pollute .</l>
     <l n="69">Thus the chaste bridegroom , when the priest draws nigh ,</l>
     <l n="70">Beholds his blessing with a trembling eye ,</l>
     <l n="71">Feels doubtful passions throb in every vein ,</l>
     <l n="72">And in his cheeks are mingled joy and pain ,</l>
     <l n="73">Lest still some intervening chance should rise ,</l>
     <l n="74">Leap forth at once , and snatch the golden prize ;</l>
     <l n="75">Inflame his woe , by bringing it so late ,</l>
     <l n="76">And stab him in the crisis of his fate .</l>
     <l n="77">Since Adam ’ s family , from first to last ,</l>

     <l n="79">Look round , vainglorious muse , and you whoe ’ er</l>

     <l n="81">Look round , and seek the lights of human race ,</l>
     <l n="82">Whose shining acts time ’ s brightest annals grace ;</l>
     <l n="83">Who founded sects ; crowns conquer ’ d , or resign ’ d ;</l>
     <l n="84">Gave names to nations : or fam ’ d empires join ’ d ;</l>
     <l n="85">Who raised the vale , and laid the mountain low ;</l>
     <l n="86">And taught obedient rivers where to flow ;</l>
     <l n="87">Who with vast fleets , as with a mighty chain ,</l>
     <l n="88">Could bind the madness of the roaring main :</l>

     <l n="305">Heaven ’ s loss , and with fresh glories fill the sky .</l>

     <l n="314">Of perfect knowledge , see , the dawning light</l>
     <l n="315">Foretells a noon most exquisitely bright !</l>
     <l n="316">Here , springs of endless joy are breaking forth !</l>
     <l n="317">There , buds the promise of celestial worth !</l>
     <l n="318">Worth , which must ripen in a happier clime ,</l>
     <l n="319">And brighter sun , beyond the bounds of time .</l>
     <l n="320">Thou , minor , canst not guess thy vast estate ,</l>
     <l n="321">What stores , on foreign coasts , thy landing wait :</l>
     <l n="322">Lose not thy claim , let virtue ’ s path be trod ;</l>
     <l n="323">Thus glad all heaven , and please that bounteous God ,</l>
     <l n="324">Who , to light thee to pleasures , hung on high</l>
     <l n="325">Yon radiant orb , proud regent of the sky :</l>
     <l n="326">That service done , its beams shall fade away ,</l>
     <l n="327">And God shine forth in one eternal day .</l>

     <l n="90">That moon which shone on his dear nuptial night ,</l>
     <l n="91">Which saw him fold her yet untasted charms</l>
     <l n="92">( Denied to princes ) in his longing arms ;</l>
     <l n="93">Now sees the transient blessing fleet away ,</l>
     <l n="94">Empire and love ! the vision of a day .</l>
     <l n="95">Thus , in the British clime , a summer-storm</l>
     <l n="96">Will oft the smiling face of heaven deform ;</l>
     <l n="97">The winds with violence at once descend ,</l>
     <l n="98">Sweep flowers and fruits , and make the forest bend ;</l>
     <l n="99">A sudden winter , while the sun is near ,</l>

     <l n="102">The beauteous captive , from the cheerful day ?</l>
     <l n="103">The scene is chang ’ d indeed ; before her eyes</l>
     <l n="104">Ill boding looks and unknown horrors rise :</l>
     <l n="105">For pomp and splendour , for her guard and crown ,</l>
     <l n="106">A gloomy dungeon , and a keeper ’ s frown :</l>
     <l n="107">Black thoughts , each morn , invade the lover ’ s breast ,</l>

     <l n="111">Religion ’ s force divine is best display ’ d</l>
     <l n="112">In deep desertion of all human aid :</l>
     <l n="113">To succour in extremes , is her delight ,</l>
     <l n="114">And cheer the heart , when terror strikes the sight .</l>
     <l n="115">We , disbelieving our own senses , gaze ,</l>
     <l n="116">And wonder what a mortal ’ s heart can raise</l>
     <l n="117">To triumph o ’ er misfortunes , smile in grief ,</l>
     <l n="118">And comfort those who come to bring relief :</l>
     <l n="119">We gaze ; and as we gaze , wealth , fame , decay ,</l>
     <l n="120">And all the world ’ s vain glories fade away .</l>
     <l n="121">Against her cares she rais ’ d a dauntless mind ,</l>

     <l n="143">If these are safe , I ’ ll think my prayers succeed ,</l>

     <l n="152">Or did , or was imagin ’ d to , complain :</l>
     <l n="153">The tapers cast an inauspicious light ;</l>

     <l n="161">With royal purple is her vision hung ;</l>
     <l n="162">By phantom hosts are shouts of conquest rung ;</l>
     <l n="163">Low at her feet the suppliant rival lies ;</l>

     <l n="201">Might comfort to his silver hairs impart ,</l>

     <l n="203">As where fruits fall , quick rising blossoms smile ,</l>
     <l n="204">And the bless ’ d Indian of his care beguile ,</l>
     <l n="205">In vain these various reasons jointly press ,</l>
     <l n="206">To blacken death , and heighten her distress ;</l>
     <l n="207">She , thro ’ th ’ encircling terrors darts her sight</l>
     <l n="208">To the bless ’ d regions of eternal light ,</l>
     <l n="209">And fills her soul with peace : to weeping friends</l>
     <l n="210">Her father , and her lord , she recommends ;</l>
     <l n="211">Unmov ’ d herself : her foes her air survey ,</l>
     <l n="212">And rage to see their malice thrown away .</l>
     <l n="213">She soars ; now nought on earth detains her care ——</l>
     <l n="214">But Guilford ; who still struggles for his share .</l>
     <l n="215">Still will his form importunately rise ,</l>
     <l n="216">Clog and retard her transport to the skies ;</l>
     <l n="217">As trembling flames now take a feeble flight ,</l>
     <l n="218">Now catch the brand with a returning light ,</l>
     <l n="219">Thus her soul onward from the seats above</l>
     <l n="220">Falls fondly back , and kindles into love :</l>
     <l n="221">At length she conquers in the doubtful field ;</l>
     <l n="222">That heaven she seeks will be her Guilford ’ s shield .</l>
     <l n="223">Now death is welcome ; his approach is slow ;</l>
     <l n="224">’ Tis tedious longer to expect the blow .</l>
     <l n="225">Oh ! mortals , short of sight , who think the past</l>
     <l n="226">O ’ erblown misfortune still shall prove the last :</l>
     <l n="227">Alas ! misfortunes travel in a train ,</l>
     <l n="228">And oft in life form one perpetual chain ;</l>
     <l n="229">Fear buries fear , and ills on ills attend ,</l>
     <l n="230">Till life and sorrow meet one common end .</l>
     <l n="231">She thinks that she has nought but death to fear ,</l>
     <l n="232">And death is conquer ’ d . Worse than death is near .</l>
     <l n="233">Her rigid trials are not yet complete ;</l>
     <l n="234">The news arrives of her great father ’ s fate .</l>
     <l n="235">She sees his hoary head , all white with age ,</l>
     <l n="236">A victim to th ’ offended monarch ’ s rage .</l>
     <l n="237">How great the mercy , had she breath ’ d her last ,</l>
     <l n="238">Ere the dire sentence on her father past !</l>
     <l n="239">A fonder parent nature never knew ;</l>
     <l n="240">And as his age increas ’ d , his fondness grew .</l>
     <l n="241">A parent ’ s love ne ’ er better was bestow ’ d ;</l>
     <l n="242">The pious daughter in her heart o ’ erflow ’ d .</l>
     <l n="243">And can she from all weakness still refrain ?</l>
     <l n="244">And still the firmness of her soul maintain ?</l>
     <l n="245">Impossible ! a sigh will force its way ;</l>
     <l n="246">One patient tear her mortal birth betray ;</l>
     <l n="247">She sighs and weeps ! but so she weeps and sighs ,</l>
     <l n="248">As silent dews descend , and vapours rise .</l>
     <l n="249">Celestial patience ! how dost thou defeat</l>
     <l n="250">The foe ’ s proud menace , and elude his hate !</l>
     <l n="251">While passion takes his part , betrays our peace ;</l>
     <l n="252">To death and torture swells each slight disgrace ;</l>
     <l n="253">By not opposing , thou dost ills destroy ,</l>
     <l n="254">And wear thy conquer ’ d sorrows into joy .</l>
     <l n="255">Now she revolves within her anxious mind ,</l>
     <l n="256">What woe still lingers in reserve behind .</l>
     <l n="257">Griefs rise on griefs , and she can see no bound ,</l>
     <l n="258">While nature lasts , and can receive a wound .</l>
     <l n="259">The sword is drawn ; the queen to rage inclin ’ d ,</l>
     <l n="260">By mercy , nor by piety , confin ’ d .</l>
     <l n="261">What mercy can the zealot ’ s heart assuage ,</l>
     <l n="262">Whose piety itself converts to rage ?</l>
     <l n="263">She thought , and sigh ’ d . And now the blood began</l>
     <l n="264">To leave her beauteous cheek all cold and wan .</l>
     <l n="265">New sorrow dimm ’ d the lustre of her eye ,</l>
     <l n="266">And on her cheek the fading roses die .</l>
     <l n="267">Alas ! should Guilford too — when now she ’ s brought</l>
     <l n="268">To that dire view , that precipice of thought ,</l>
     <l n="269">While there she trembling stands , nor dares look down ,</l>
     <l n="270">Nor can recede , till heaven ’ s decrees are known ;</l>
     <l n="271">Cure of all ills , till now , her lord appears —</l>
     <l n="272">But not to cheer her heart , and dry her tears !</l>
     <l n="273">Not now , as usual , like the rising day ,</l>
     <l n="274">To chase the shadows , and the damps away :</l>
     <l n="275">But , like a gloomy storm , at once to sweep</l>
     <l n="276">And plunge her to the bottom of the deep .</l>
     <l n="277">Black were his robes , dejected was his air ,</l>
     <l n="278">His voice was frozen by his cold despair ;</l>
     <l n="279">Slow , like a ghost , he mov ’ d with solemn pace ;</l>
     <l n="280">A dying paleness sat upon his face .</l>
     <l n="281">Back she recoil ’ d , she smote her lovely breast ,</l>
     <l n="282">Her eyes the anguish of her heart confess ’ d ;</l>
     <l n="283">Struck to the soul , she stagger ’ d with the wound ,</l>
     <l n="284">And sunk , a breathless image , to the ground .</l>
     <l n="285">Thus the fair lily , when the sky ’ s o ’ ercast ,</l>
     <l n="286">At first but shudders in the feeble blast ;</l>
     <l n="287">But when the winds and weighty rains descend ,</l>
     <l n="288">The fair and upright stem is forc ’ d to bend ;</l>
     <l n="289">Till broke at length , its snowy leaves are shed ,</l>
     <l n="290">And strew with dying sweets their native bed .</l>

     <l n="1">Her Guilford clasps her , beautiful in death ,</l>
     <l n="2">And with a kiss recalls her fleeting breath ,</l>
     <l n="3">To tapers thus , which by a blast expire ,</l>
     <l n="4">A lighted taper , touch ’ d , restores the fire :</l>
     <l n="5">She rear ’ d her swimming eye , and saw the light ,</l>
     <l n="6">And Guilford too , or she had loath ’ d the sight :</l>
     <l n="7">Her father ’ s death she bore , despis ’ d her own ,</l>
     <l n="8">But now she must , she will , have leave to groan :</l>
     <l n="9">Ah ! Guilford , she began , and would have spoke ;</l>
     <l n="10">But sobs rush ’ d in , and ev ’ ry accent broke :</l>
     <l n="11">Reason itself , as gusts of passion blew ,</l>
     <l n="12">Was ruffled in the tempest , and withdrew .</l>
     <l n="13">So the youth lost his image in the well ,</l>
     <l n="14">When tears upon the yielding surface fell .</l>
     <l n="15">The scatter ’ d features slid into decay ,</l>
     <l n="16">And spreading circles drove his face away .</l>
     <l n="17">To touch the soft affections , and control</l>
     <l n="18">The manly temper of the bravest soul ,</l>
     <l n="19">What with afflicted beauty can compare ,</l>
     <l n="20">And drops of love distilling from the fair ?</l>
     <l n="21">It melts us down ; our pains delight bestow ;</l>
     <l n="22">And we with fondness languish o ’ er our woe .</l>
     <l n="23">This Guilford prov ’ d ; and , with excess of pain ,</l>
     <l n="24">And pleasure too , did to his bosom strain</l>
     <l n="25">The weeping fair : sunk deep in soft desire ,</l>
     <l n="26">Indulg ’ d his love , and nurs ’ d the raging fire :</l>
     <l n="27">Then tore himself away ; and , standing wide ,</l>
     <l n="28">As fearing a relapse of fondness , cried ,</l>
     <l n="29">With ill-dissembled grief ; “ My life , forbear !</l>
     <l n="30">You wound your Guilford with each cruel tear :</l>
     <l n="31">Did you not chide my grief ? repress your own ;</l>
     <l n="32">Nor want compassion for yourself alone :</l>
     <l n="33">Have you beheld , how , from the distant main ,</l>
     <l n="34">The thronging waves roll on , a num ’ rous train ,</l>
     <l n="35">And foam , and bellow , till they reach the shore ;</l>
     <l n="36">There burst their noisy pride , and are no more ?</l>
     <l n="37">Thus the successive flows of human race ,</l>
     <l n="38">Chas ’ d by the coming , the preceding , chase ;</l>
     <l n="39">They sound , and swell , their haughty heads they rear ;</l>
     <l n="40">Then fall , and flatten , break , and disappear .</l>
     <l n="41">Life is a forfeit we must shortly pay ;</l>
     <l n="42">And where ’ s the mighty lucre of a day ?</l>
     <l n="43">Why should you mourn my fate ? ’ tis most unkind ;</l>
     <l n="44">Your own you bore with an unshaken mind :</l>
     <l n="45">And which , can you imagine , was the dart</l>
     <l n="46">That drank most blood , sunk deepest in my heart ?</l>
     <l n="47">I cannot live without you ; and my doom</l>
     <l n="48">I meet with joy , to share one common tomb .—</l>
     <l n="49">And are again your tears profusely spilt !</l>
     <l n="50">Oh ! then , my kindness blackens to my guilt ;</l>
     <l n="51">It foils itself , if it recall your pain ;—</l>
     <l n="52">Life of my life , I beg you to refrain !</l>
     <l n="53">The load which fate imposes , you increase ;</l>
     <l n="54">And help Maria to destroy my peace . ”</l>
     <l n="55">But , oh ! against himself his labour turn ’ d ;</l>
     <l n="56">The more he comforted , the more she mourn ’ d :</l>
     <l n="57">Compassion swells our grief ; words soft and kind</l>
     <l n="58">But soothe our weakness , and dissolve the mind :</l>
     <l n="59">Her sorrow flow ’ d in streams ; nor hers alone ,</l>
     <l n="60">While that he blam ’ d , he yielded to his own .</l>
     <l n="61">Where are the smiles she wore , when she , so late ,</l>
     <l n="62">Hail ’ d him great partner of the regal state ;</l>
     <l n="63">When orient gems around her temples blaz ’ d ,</l>
     <l n="64">And bending nations on the glory gaz ’ d ?</l>
     <l n="65">’ Tis now the queen ’ s command , they both retreat ,</l>
     <l n="66">To weep with dignity , and mourn in state :</l>
     <l n="67">She forms the decent misery with joy ,</l>
     <l n="68">And loads with pomp the wretch she would destroy .</l>
     <l n="69">A spacious hall is hung with black ; all light</l>
     <l n="70">Shut out , and noon-day darken ’ d into night .</l>
     <l n="71">From the mid-roof a lamp depends on high ,</l>
     <l n="72">Like a dim crescent in a clouded sky :</l>
     <l n="73">It sheds a quiv ’ ring melancholy gloom ,</l>
     <l n="74">Which only shows the darkness of the room .</l>
     <l n="75">A shining axe is on the table laid ;</l>
     <l n="76">A dreadful sight ! and glitters through the shade .</l>
     <l n="77">In this sad scene the lovers are confin ’ d ;</l>
     <l n="78">A scene of terrors , to a guilty mind !</l>
     <l n="79">A scene , that would have damp ’ d with rising cares ,</l>
     <l n="80">And quite extinguish ’ d every love but theirs .</l>
     <l n="81">What can they do ? They fix their mournful eyes ——</l>
     <l n="82">Then Guilford , thus abruptly ; “ I despise</l>
     <l n="83">An empire lost ; I fling away the crown ;</l>
     <l n="84">Numbers have laid that bright delusion down ;</l>
     <l n="85">But where ’ s the Charles , or Dioclesian where ,</l>
     <l n="86">Could quit the blooming , wedded , weeping fair ?</l>
     <l n="87">Oh ! to dwell ever on thy lip ! to stand</l>
     <l n="88">In full possession of thy snowy hand !</l>
     <l n="89">And , thro ’ th ’ unclouded crystal of thine eye ,</l>
     <l n="90">The heavenly treasures of thy mind to spy !</l>
     <l n="91">Till rapture reason happily destroys ,</l>
     <l n="92">And my soul wanders through immortal joys !</l>
     <l n="93">Give me the world , and ask me , where ’ s my bliss ?</l>
     <l n="94">I clasp thee to my breast , and answer , this .</l>
     <l n="95">And shall the grave "— He groans , and can no more ;</l>
     <l n="96">But all her charms in silence traces o ’ er ;</l>
     <l n="97">Her lip , her cheek , and eye , to wonder wrought ;</l>
     <l n="98">And , wond ’ ring , sees , in sad presaging thought ,</l>
     <l n="99">From that fair neck , that world of beauty fall ,</l>
     <l n="100">And roll along the dust , a ghastly ball !</l>
     <l n="101">Oh ! let those tremble , who are greatly bless ’ d !</l>
     <l n="102">For who , but Guilford , could be thus distress ’ d ?</l>
     <l n="103">Come hither , all you happy , all you great ,</l>
     <l n="104">From flowery meadows , and from rooms of state ;</l>
     <l n="105">Nor think I call , your pleasures to destroy ,</l>
     <l n="106">But to refine , and to exalt your joy :</l>
     <l n="107">Weep not ; but , smiling , fix your ardent care</l>
     <l n="108">On nobler titles than the brave or fair .</l>
     <l n="109">Was ever such a mournful , moving sight ?</l>
     <l n="110">See , if you can , by that dull , trembling light :</l>
     <l n="111">Now they embrace ; and , mix ’ d with bitter woe ,</l>
     <l n="112">Like Isis and her Thames , one stream they flow :</l>
     <l n="113">Now they start wide ; fix ’ d in benumbing care ,</l>
     <l n="114">They stiffen into statues of despair :</l>
     <l n="115">Now , tenderly severe , and fiercely kind ,</l>
     <l n="116">They rush at once ; they fling their cares behind ,</l>
     <l n="117">And clasp , as if to death ; new vows repeat ;</l>
     <l n="118">And , quite wrapp ’ d up in love , forget their fate .</l>
     <l n="119">A short delusion ! for the raging pain</l>
     <l n="120">Returns ; and their poor hearts must bleed again .</l>
     <l n="121">Meantime , the queen new cruelty decreed ;</l>
     <l n="122">But , ill content that they should only bleed ,</l>
     <l n="123">A priest is sent ; who , with insidious art ,</l>
     <l n="124">Instills his poison into Suffolk ’ s heart ;</l>
     <l n="125">And Guilford drank it : banging on the breast ,</l>
     <l n="126">He from his childhood was with Rome possest .</l>
     <l n="127">When now the ministers of death draw nigh ,</l>
     <l n="128">And in her dearest lord she first must die ,</l>
     <l n="129">The subtle priest , who long had watch ’ d to find</l>
     <l n="130">The most unguarded passes of her mind ,</l>
     <l n="131">Bespoke her thus : “ Grieve not ; ’ tis in your power</l>
     <l n="132">Your lord to rescue from this fatal hour . ”</l>
     <l n="133">Her bosom pants ; she draws her breath with pain ;</l>
     <l n="134">A sudden horror thrills through every vein ;</l>
     <l n="135">Life seems suspended , on his words intent ;</l>
     <l n="136">And her soul trembles for the great event .</l>
     <l n="137">The priest proceeds : “ Embrace the faith of Rome ,</l>
     <l n="138">And ward your own , your lord ’ s , and father ’ s doom . ”</l>
     <l n="139">Ye blessed spirits ! now your charge sustain ;</l>
     <l n="140">The past was ease ; now first she suffers pain .</l>
     <l n="141">Must she pronounce her father ’ s death ? must she</l>
     <l n="142">Bid Guilford bleed ?— It must not , cannot , be .</l>
     <l n="143">It cannot be ! But ’ tis the Christian ’ s praise ,</l>
     <l n="144">Above impossibilities to raise</l>
     <l n="145">The weakness of our nature ; and deride</l>
     <l n="146">Of vain philosophy the boasted pride .</l>
     <l n="147">What though our feeble sinews scarce impart</l>
     <l n="148">A moment ’ s swiftness to the feather ’ d dart ;</l>
     <l n="149">Though tainted air our vig ’ rous youth can break ,</l>
     <l n="150">And a chill blast the hardy warrior shake ,</l>
     <l n="151">Yet are we strong : hear the loud tempest roar</l>
     <l n="152">From east to west , and call us weak no more ;</l>
     <l n="153">The lightning ’ s unresisted force proclaims</l>
     <l n="154">Our might ; and thunders raise our humble names ;</l>
     <l n="155">’ Tis our Jehovah fills the heavens ; as long</l>
     <l n="156">As he shall reign Almighty , we are strong :</l>
     <l n="157">We , by devotion , borrow from his throne ;</l>
     <l n="158">And almost make Omnipotence our own :</l>
     <l n="159">We force the gates of heaven , by fervent prayer ;</l>
     <l n="160">And call forth triumph out of man ’ s despair .</l>
     <l n="161">Our lovely mourner , kneeling , lifts her eyes</l>
     <l n="162">And bleeding heart , in silence , to the skies ,</l>
     <l n="163">Devoutly sad — then , bright ’ ning , like the day ,</l>
     <l n="164">When sudden winds sweep scatter ’ d clouds away ,</l>
     <l n="165">Shining in majesty , till now unknown ,</l>
     <l n="166">And breathing life and spirit scarce her own ;</l>
     <l n="167">She , rising , speaks : “ If these the terms —— ”</l>
     <l n="168">Here , Guilford , cruel Guilford , ( barb ’ rous man !</l>
     <l n="169">Is this thy love ? ) as swift as lightning ran ;</l>
     <l n="170">O ’ erwhelm ’ d her with tempestuous sorrow fraught ,</l>
     <l n="171">And stifled , in its birth , the mighty thought ;</l>
     <l n="172">Then bursting fresh into a flood of tears ,</l>
     <l n="173">Fierce , resolute , delirious with his fears ;</l>
     <l n="174">His fears for her alone : he beat his breast ,</l>
     <l n="175">And thus the fervour of his soul exprest :</l>
     <l n="176">“ Oh ! let thy thought o ’ er our past converse rove ,</l>
     <l n="177">And show one moment uninflam ’ d with love !</l>
     <l n="178">Oh ! if thy kindness can no longer last ,</l>
     <l n="179">In pity to thyself , forget the past !</l>
     <l n="180">Else wilt thou never , void of shame and fear ,</l>
     <l n="181">Pronounce his doom , whom thou hast held so dear :</l>
     <l n="182">Thou who hast took me to thy arms , and swore</l>
     <l n="183">Empires were vile , and fate could give no more :</l>
     <l n="184">That to continue , was its utmost power ,</l>
     <l n="185">And make the future like the present hour .</l>
     <l n="186">Now call a ruffian ; bid his cruel sword</l>
     <l n="187">Lay wide the bosom of thy worthless lord ;</l>
     <l n="188">Transfix his heart ( since you its love disclaim ) ,</l>
     <l n="189">And stain his honour with a traitor ’ s name .</l>
     <l n="190">This might perhaps be borne without remorse ;</l>
     <l n="191">But sure a father ’ s pangs will have their force !</l>
     <l n="192">Shall his good age , so near its journey ’ s end ,</l>
     <l n="193">Through cruel torment to the grave descend ?</l>
     <l n="194">His shallow blood all issue at a wound ,</l>
     <l n="195">Wash a slave ’ s feet , and smoke upon the ground ?</l>
     <l n="196">But he to you has ever been severe ;</l>
     <l n="197">Then take your vengeance "— Suffolk now drew near ;</l>
     <l n="198">Bending beneath the burden of his care ;</l>
     <l n="199">His robes neglected , and his head was bare ;</l>
     <l n="200">Decrepid winter , in the yearly ring ,</l>
     <l n="201">Thus slowly creeps , to meet the blooming spring :</l>
     <l n="202">Downward he cast a melancholy look ;</l>
     <l n="203">Thrice turn ’ d , to hide his grief ; then faintly spoke :</l>
     <l n="204">“ Now deep in years , and forward in decay ,</l>
     <l n="205">That axe can only rob me of a day ;</l>
     <l n="206">For thee , my soul ’ s desire ! I can ’ t refrain ;</l>
     <l n="207">And shall my tears , my last tears , flow in vain ?</l>
     <l n="208">When you shall know a mother ’ s tender name ,</l>
     <l n="209">My heart ’ s distress no longer will you blame . ”</l>
     <l n="210">At this , afar his bursting groans were heard ;</l>
     <l n="211">The tears ran trickling down his silver beard :</l>
     <l n="212">He snatch ’ d her hand , which to his lips he prest ,</l>
     <l n="213">And bid her plant a dagger in his breast ;</l>
     <l n="214">Then , sinking , call ’ d her piety unjust ,</l>
     <l n="215">And soil ’ d his hoary temples in the dust .</l>
     <l n="216">Hard-hearted men ! will you no mercy know ?</l>
     <l n="217">Has the queen brib ’ d you to distress her foe ?</l>
     <l n="218">O weak deserters to misfortune ’ s part ,</l>
     <l n="219">By false affection thus to pierce her heart !</l>
     <l n="220">When she had soar ’ d , to let your arrows fly ,</l>

     <l n="222">And can her virtue , springing from the ground ,</l>
     <l n="223">Her flight recover , and disdain the wound ,</l>
     <l n="224">When cleaving love , and human interest , bind</l>
     <l n="225">The broken force of her aspiring mind ;</l>
     <l n="226">As round the gen ’ rous eagle , which in vain</l>
     <l n="227">Exerts her strength , the serpent wreaths his train ,</l>
     <l n="228">Her struggling wings entangles , curling plies</l>

    <head>— HOR .</head>
     <l n="1">Preface .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>These satires have been favourably received at home and abroad . I am not conscious of the least malevolence to any particular person through all the characters ; though some persons may be so selfish , as to engross a general application to themselves . A writer in polite letters should be content with reputation ; the private amusement he finds in his compositions ; the good influence they have on his severer studies ; that admission they give him to his superiors ; and the possible good effect they may have on the public ; or else he should join to his politeness some more lucrative qualification .</p>
   <p>But it is possible , that satire may not do much good : men may rise in their affections to their follies , as they do to their friends , when they are abused by others : it is much to be feared , that misconduct will never be chased out of the world by satire ; all therefore that is to be said for it is , that misconduct will certainly be never chased out of the world by satire , if no satires are written : nor is that term unapplicable to graver compositions . Ethics , heathen and Christian , and the Scriptures themselves , are , in a great measure , a satire on the weakness and iniquity of men ; and some part of that satire is in verse too : nay , in the first ages , philosophy and poetry were the same thing ; wisdom wore no other dress : so that , I hope , these satires will be the more easily pardoned that misfortune by the severe . Nay , historians themselves may be considered as satirists , and satirists most severe ; since such are most human actions , that to relate , is to expose them .</p>
   <p>No man can converse much in the world , but , at what he meets with , he must either be insensible , or grieve , or be angry , or smile . Some passion ( if we are not impassive ) must be moved ; for the general conduct of mankind is by no means a thing indifferent to a reasonable and virtuous man . Now to smile at it , and turn it into ridicule , I think most eligible ; as it hurts ourselves least , and gives vice and folly the greatest offence : and that for this reason ; because what men aim at by them , is , generally , public opinion and esteem ; which truth is the subject of the following satire ; and joins them together , as several brandies from the same root : a unity of design , which has not , I think , in a set of satires , been attempted before .</p>
   <p>Laughing at the misconduct of the world , will , in a great measure , ease us of any more disagreeable passion about it . One passion is more effectually driven out by another , than by reason ; whatever some may teach : for to reason we owe our passions : had we not reason , we should not be offended at what we find amiss : and the cause seems not to be the natural cure of any effect .</p>
   <p>Moreover , laughing satire bids the fairest for success : the world is too proud to be fond of a serious tutor ; and when an author is in a passion , the laugh , generally , as in conversation , turns against him . This kind of satire only has any delicacy in it . Of this delicacy Horace is the best master : he appears in good humour while he censures ; and therefore his censure has the more weight , as supposed to proceed from judgment , not from passion . Juvenal is ever in a passion ; he has little valuable but his eloquence and morality : the last of which I have had in my eye : but rather for emulation , than imitation , through my whole work .</p>
   <p>But though I comparatively condemn Juvenal , in part of the sixth satire ( where the occasion most required it ) , I endeavoured to touch on his manner ; but was forced to quit it soon , as disagreeable to the writer , and reader too . Boileau has joined both the Roman satirists with great success ; but has too much of Juvenal in his very serious satire on woman , which should have been the gayest of all . An excellent critic of our own commends Boileau ’ s closeness , or , as he calls it , pressness , particularly ; whereas , it appears to me , that repetition is his fault , if any fault should be imputed to him .</p>
   <p>There are some prose satirists of the greatest delicacy and wit ; the last of which can never , or should never , succeed without the former . An author without it , betrays too great a contempt for mankind , and opinion of himself , which are bad advocates for reputation and success . What a difference is there between the merit , if not the wit , of Cervantes and Rabelais ? The last has a particular art of throwing a great deal of genius and learning into frolic and jest ; but the genius and the scholar is all you can admire ; you want the gentleman to converse with in him : he is like a criminal who receives his life for some services ; you commend , but you pardon too . Indecency offends our pride , as men ; and our unaffected taste , as judges of composition : nature has wisely formed us with an aversion to it ; and he that succeeds in spite of it , is , ( 5 ) aliena venia , quam sua providentia tutior .</p>
   <p>Such wits , like false oracles of old ( which were wits and cheats ) , should set up for reputation among the weak , in some Bœotia , which was the land of oracles ; for the wise will hold them in contempt . Some wits , too , like oracles , deal in ambiguities ; but not with equal success : for though ambiguities are the first excellence of an impostor , they are the last of a wit .</p>
   <p>Some satirical wits and humourists , like their father Lucian , laugh at every thing indiscriminately ; which betrays such a poverty of wit , as cannot afford to part with any thing ; and such a want of virtue , as to postpone it to a jest . Such writers encourage vice and folly , which they pretend to combat , by setting them on an equal foot with better things : and while they labour to bring every thing into contempt , how can they expect their own parts should escape ? Some French writers , particularly , are guilty of this in matters of the last consequence ; and some of our own . They that are for lessening the true dignity of mankind , are not sure of being successful , but with regard to one individual in it . It is this conduct that justly makes a wit a term of reproach .</p>
   <p>Which puts me in mind of Plato ’ s fable of the birth of love ; one of the prettiest fables of all antiquity ; which will hold likewise with regard to modern poetry . Love , says he , is the son of the goddess poverty , and the god of riches : he has from his father his daring genius ; his elevation of thought ; his building castles in the air ; his prodigality ; his neglect of things serious and useful ; his vain opinion of his own merit ; and his affectation of preference and distinction : from his mother he inherits his indigence , which makes him a constant beggar of favours ; that importunity with which he begs ; his flattery ; his servility ; his fear of being despised , which is inseparable from him . This addition may be made ; viz . that poetry , like love , is a little subject to blindness , which makes her mistake her way to preferments and honours ; that she has her satirical quiver ; and , lastly , that she retains a dutiful admiration of her father ’ s family ; but divides her favours , and generally lives with her mother ’ s relations .</p>
   <p>However , this is not necessity , but choice : were wisdom her governess , she might have much more of the father than the mother ; especially in such an age as this , which shows a due passion for her charms .</p>

     <l n="340">What ’ s he who sighs for wealth , or fame , or power ?</l>
     <l n="341">Another Florio doting on a flower ;</l>
     <l n="342">A short liv ’ d flower ; and which has often sprung</l>
     <l n="343">From sordid arts , as Florio ’ s out of dung .</l>
     <l n="344">With what , O Codrus ! is thy fancy smit ?</l>
     <l n="345">The flower of learning , and the bloom of wit .</l>
     <l n="346">The gaudy shelves with crimson bindings glow ,</l>
     <l n="347">And Epictetus is a perfect beau .</l>
     <l n="348">How fit for thee ! bound up in crimson too ,</l>
     <l n="349">Gilt , and , like them , devoted to the view !</l>
     <l n="350">Thy books are furniture . Methinks ’ tis hard</l>
     <l n="351">That science should be purchas ’ d by the yard ;</l>
     <l n="352">And Tonson , turn ’ d upholsterer , send home</l>
     <l n="353">The gilded leather to fit up thy room .</l>
     <l n="354">If not to some peculiar end design ’ d ,</l>
     <l n="355">Study ’ s the specious trifling of the mind ;</l>
     <l n="356">Or is at best a secondary aim ,</l>
     <l n="357">A chase for sport alone , and not for game .</l>
     <l n="358">If so , sure they who the mere volume prize ,</l>
     <l n="359">But love the thicket where the quarry lies .</l>
     <l n="360">On buying books Lorenzo long was bent ,</l>
     <l n="361">But found at length that it reduc ’ d his rent ;</l>
     <l n="362">His farms were flown ; when , lo ! a sale comes on ,</l>
     <l n="363">A choice collection ! what is to be done ?</l>
     <l n="364">He sells his last ; for he the whole will buy ;</l>
     <l n="365">Sells ev ’ n his house ; nay , wants whereon to lie :</l>
     <l n="366">So high the gen ’ rous ardour of the man</l>
     <l n="367">For Romans , Greeks , and Orientals ran .</l>
     <l n="368">When terms were drawn , and brought him by the clerk ,</l>
     <l n="369">Lorenzo sign ’ d the bargain — with his mark .</l>
     <l n="370">Unlearned men of books assume the care ,</l>
     <l n="371">As eunuchs are the guardians of the fair .</l>
     <l n="372">Not in his authors ’ liveries alone</l>
     <l n="373">Is Codrus ’ erudite ambition shown :</l>
     <l n="374">Editions various , at high prices bought ,</l>
     <l n="375">Inform the world what Codrus would be thought ;</l>
     <l n="376">And to his cost another must succeed</l>
     <l n="377">To pay a sage , who says that he can read ;</l>
     <l n="378">Who titles knows , and indexes has seen ;</l>
     <l n="379">But leaves to Chesterfield what lies between ;</l>
     <l n="380">Of pompous books who shuns the proud expense ,</l>
     <l n="381">And humbly is contented with their sense .</l>
     <l n="382">O Stanhope , whose accomplishments make good</l>
     <l n="383">The promise of a long illustrious blood ,</l>
     <l n="384">In arts and manners eminently grac ’ d ,</l>
     <l n="385">The strictest honour ! and the finest taste !</l>
     <l n="386">Accept this verse ; if satire can agree</l>
     <l n="387">With so consummate a humanity .</l>
     <l n="388">By your example would Hilario mend ,</l>
     <l n="389">How would it grace the talents of my friend ,</l>
     <l n="390">Who , with the charms of his own genius smit ,</l>
     <l n="391">Conceives all virtues are compris ’ d in wit !</l>
     <l n="392">But time his fervent petulance may cool ;</l>
     <l n="393">For though he is a wit , he is no fool .</l>
     <l n="394">In time he ’ ll learn to use , not waste , his sense ;</l>
     <l n="395">Nor make a frailty of an excellence .</l>
     <l n="396">He spares nor friend , nor foe ; but calls to mind ,</l>
     <l n="397">Like doomsday , all the faults of all mankind .</l>
     <l n="398">What though wit tickles ? tickling is unsafe ,</l>
     <l n="399">If still ’ tis painful while it makes us laugh .</l>
     <l n="400">Who , for the poor renown of being smart ,</l>
     <l n="401">Would leave a sting within a brother ’ s heart ?</l>
     <l n="402">Parts may be prais ’ d , good-nature is ador ’ d ;</l>
     <l n="403">Then draw your wit as seldom as your sword ;</l>
     <l n="404">And never on the weak ; or you ’ ll appear</l>
     <l n="405">As there no hero , no great genius here .</l>
     <l n="406">As in smooth oil the razor best is whet ,</l>
     <l n="407">So wit is by politeness sharpest set :</l>
     <l n="408">Their want of edge from their offence is seen ;</l>
     <l n="409">Both pain us least when exquisitely keen .</l>
     <l n="410">The fame men give is for the joy they find ;</l>
     <l n="411">Dull is the jester , when the joke ’ s unkind .</l>
     <l n="412">Since Marcus , doubtless , thinks himself a wit ,</l>
     <l n="413">To pay my compliment , what place so fit ?</l>
     <l n="414">His most facetious ( 11 ) letters came to hand ,</l>
     <l n="415">Which my first satire sweetly reprimand :</l>
     <l n="416">If that a just offence to Marcus gave ,</l>
     <l n="417">Say , Marcus , which art thou , a fool , or knave ?</l>
     <l n="418">For all but such with caution I forbore ;</l>
     <l n="419">That thou wast either , I ne ’ er knew before :</l>
     <l n="420">I know thee now , both what thou art , and who ;</l>
     <l n="421">No mask so good , but Marcus must shine through :</l>
     <l n="422">False names are vain , thy lines their author tell ;</l>
     <l n="423">Thy best concealment had been writing well :</l>
     <l n="424">But thou a brave neglect of fame hast shown ,</l>
     <l n="425">Of others ’ fame , great genius ! and thy own .</l>
     <l n="426">Write on unheeded ; and this maxim know ,</l>
     <l n="427">The man who pardons , disappoints his foe .</l>
     <l n="428">In malice to proud wits , some proudly lull</l>
     <l n="429">Their peevish reason ; vain of being dull ;</l>
     <l n="430">When some home joke has stung their solemn souls ,</l>
     <l n="431">In vengeance they determine to be fools ;</l>
     <l n="432">Through spleen , that little nature gave , make less ,</l>
     <l n="433">Quite zealous in the way of heaviness ;</l>
     <l n="434">To lumps inanimate a fondness take ;</l>
     <l n="435">And disinherit sons that are awake .</l>
     <l n="436">These , when their utmost venom they would spit ,</l>
     <l n="437">Most barbarously tell you —" He ’ s a wit . ”</l>
     <l n="438">Poor negroes , thus , to show their burning spite</l>
     <l n="439">To cacodemons , say , they ’ re dev ’ lish white .</l>
     <l n="440">Lampridius , from the bottom of his breast ,</l>
     <l n="441">Sighs o ’ er one child ; but triumphs in the rest .</l>
     <l n="442">How just his grief ! one carries in his head</l>
     <l n="443">A less proportion of the father ’ s lead ;</l>
     <l n="444">And is in danger , without special grace ,</l>
     <l n="445">To rise above a justice of the peace .</l>
     <l n="446">The dunghill breed of men a diamond scorn ,</l>
     <l n="447">And feel a passion for a grain of corn ;</l>
     <l n="448">Some stupid , plodding , monkey-loving wight ,</l>
     <l n="449">Who wins their hearts by knowing black from white ,</l>
     <l n="450">Who with much pains , exerting all his sense ,</l>
     <l n="451">Can range aright his shillings , pounds , and pence .</l>
     <l n="452">The booby father craves a booby son ;</l>
     <l n="453">And by heaven ’ s blessing thinks himself undone .</l>
     <l n="454">Wants of all kinds are made to fame a plea ;</l>
     <l n="455">One learns to lisp ; another not to see :</l>
     <l n="456">Miss D ——, tottering , catches at your hand :</l>
     <l n="457">Was ever thing so pretty born to stand ?</l>
     <l n="458">Whilst these , what nature gave , disown , through pride ,</l>
     <l n="459">Others affect what nature has denied ;</l>
     <l n="460">What nature has denied , fools will pursue ,</l>
     <l n="461">As apes are ever walking upon two .</l>
     <l n="462">Crassus , a grateful sage , our awe and sport !</l>
     <l n="463">Supports grave forms ; for forms the sage support .</l>
     <l n="464">He hems ; and cries , with an important air ,</l>
     <l n="465">“ If yonder clouds withdraw it will be fair : ”</l>
     <l n="466">Then quotes the Stagyrite , to prove it true ;</l>
     <l n="467">And adds , “ The learn ’ d delight in something new . ”</l>
     <l n="468">Is ’ t not enough the blockhead scarce can read ,</l>
     <l n="469">But must he wisely look , and gravely plead ?</l>
     <l n="470">As far a formalist from wisdom sits ,</l>
     <l n="471">In judging eyes , as libertines from wits .</l>
     <l n="472">These subtle wights ( so blind are mortal men ,</l>
     <l n="473">Though satire couch them with her keenest pen )</l>
     <l n="474">For ever will hang out a solemn face ,</l>
     <l n="475">To put off nonsense with a better grace :</l>
     <l n="476">As pedlers with some hero ’ s head make bold ,</l>
     <l n="477">Illustrious mark ! where pins are to be sold .</l>
     <l n="478">What ’ s the bent brow , or neck in thought reclin ’ d ?</l>
     <l n="479">The body ’ s wisdom to conceal the mind .</l>
     <l n="480">A man of sense can artifice disdain ;</l>
     <l n="481">As men of wealth may venture to go plain ;</l>
     <l n="482">And be this truth eternal ne ’ er forgot ,</l>
     <l n="483">Solemnity ’ s a cover for a sot .</l>
     <l n="484">I find the fool , when I behold the screen ;</l>
     <l n="485">For ’ tis the wise man ’ s interest to be seen .</l>
     <l n="486">Hence , Chesterfield , that openness of heart ,</l>
     <l n="487">And just disdain for that poor mimic art ;</l>
     <l n="488">Hence ( manly praise ! ) that manner nobly free ,</l>
     <l n="489">Which all admire , and I commend , in thee .</l>
     <l n="490">With generous scorn how oft hast thou survey ’ d</l>
     <l n="491">Of court and town the noontide masquerade ;</l>
     <l n="492">Where swarms of knaves the vizor quite disgrace ,</l>
     <l n="493">And hide secure behind a naked face ?</l>
     <l n="494">Where nature ’ s end of language is declin ’ d ,</l>
     <l n="495">And men talk only to conceal the mind ;</l>
     <l n="496">Where gen ’ rous hearts the greatest hazard run ,</l>
     <l n="497">And he who trusts a brother , is undone ?</l>
     <l n="498">These all their care expend on outward show</l>
     <l n="499">For wealth and fame ; for fame alone , the beau .</l>
     <l n="500">Of late at White ’ s was young Florello seen !</l>
     <l n="501">How blank his look ! how discompos ’ d his mien !</l>
     <l n="502">So hard it proves in grief sincere to feign !</l>
     <l n="503">Sunk were his spirits ; for his coat was plain .</l>
     <l n="504">Next day his breast regain ’ d its wonted peace ;</l>
     <l n="505">His health was mended with a silver lace .</l>
     <l n="506">A curious artist , long inur ’ d to toils</l>
     <l n="507">Of gentler sort , with combs , and fragrant oils ,</l>
     <l n="508">Whether by chance , or by some god inspir ’ d ,</l>
     <l n="509">So touch ’ d his curls , his mighty soul was fir ’ d .</l>
     <l n="510">The well swoln ties an equal homage claim ,</l>
     <l n="511">And either shoulder has its share of fame ;</l>
     <l n="512">His sumptuous watch-case , tho ’ conceal ’ d it lies ,</l>
     <l n="513">Like a good conscience , solid joy supplies .</l>
     <l n="514">He only thinks himself ( so far from vain ! )</l>
     <l n="515">Stanhope in wit , in breeding Deloraine .</l>
     <l n="516">Whene ’ er , by seeming chance , he throws his eye</l>
     <l n="517">On mirrors that reflect his Tyrian dye ,</l>
     <l n="518">With how sublime a transport leaps his heart !</l>
     <l n="519">But fate ordains that dearest friends must part .</l>
     <l n="520">In active measures , brought from France , he wheels ,</l>
     <l n="521">And triumphs , conscious of his learned heels .</l>
     <l n="522">So have I seen , on some bright summer ’ s day ,</l>
     <l n="523">A calf of genius , debonnair and gay ,</l>
     <l n="524">Dance on the bank , as if inspir ’ d by fame ,</l>
     <l n="525">Fond of the pretty fellow in the stream .</l>
     <l n="526">Morose is sunk with shame , whene ’ er surpris ’ d</l>
     <l n="527">In linen clean , or peruke undisguis ’ d .</l>
     <l n="528">No sublunary chance his vestments fear ;</l>
     <l n="529">Valu ’ d , like leopards , as their spots appear .</l>
     <l n="530">A fam ’ d surtout he wears , which once was blue ,</l>
     <l n="531">And his foot swims in a capacious shoe ;</l>
     <l n="532">One day his wife ( for who can wives reclaim ? )</l>
     <l n="533">Levell ’ d her barb ’ rous needle at his fame :</l>
     <l n="534">But open force was vain ; by night she went ,</l>
     <l n="535">And while he slept , surpris ’ d the darling rent :</l>
     <l n="536">Where yawn ’ d the frieze is now become a doubt ;</l>
     <l n="537">And glory , at one entrance , quite shut out . ( 12 )</l>
     <l n="538">He scorns Florello , and Florello him ;</l>
     <l n="539">This hates the filthy creature ; that , the prim :</l>
     <l n="540">Thus , in each other , both these fools despise</l>
     <l n="541">Their own dear selves , with undiscerning eyes ;</l>
     <l n="542">Their methods various , but alike their aim ;</l>
     <l n="543">The sloven and the fopling are the same .</l>
     <l n="544">Ye whigs and tories ! thus it fares with you ,</l>
     <l n="545">When party rage too warmly you pursue ;</l>
     <l n="546">Then both club nonsense , and impetuous pride ,</l>
     <l n="547">And folly joins whom sentiments divide .</l>
     <l n="548">You vent your spleen , as monkeys , when they pass ,</l>
     <l n="549">Scratch at the mimic monkey in the glass ;</l>
     <l n="550">While both are one : and henceforth be it known ,</l>
     <l n="551">Fools of both sides shall stand for fools alone .</l>
     <l n="552">“ But who art thou ? ” methinks Florello cries ;</l>
     <l n="553">“ Of all thy species art thou only wise ? ”</l>
     <l n="554">Since smallest things can give our sins a twitch ,</l>
     <l n="555">As crossing straws retard a passing witch ,</l>
     <l n="556">Florello , thou my monitor shalt be ;</l>
     <l n="557">I ’ ll conjure thus some profit out of thee .</l>
     <l n="558">O thou myself ! abroad our counsels roam ,</l>
     <l n="559">And , like ill husbands , take no care at home :</l>
     <l n="560">Thou too art wounded with the common dart ,</l>
     <l n="561">And love of fame lies throbbing at thy heart ;</l>
     <l n="562">And what wise means to gain it hast thou chose ?</l>
     <l n="563">Know , fame and fortune both are made of prose .</l>
     <l n="564">Is thy ambition sweating for a rhyme ,</l>
     <l n="565">Thou unambitious fool , at this late time ?</l>
     <l n="566">While I a moment name , a moment ’ s past ;</l>
     <l n="567">I ’ m nearer death in this verse , than the last :</l>
     <l n="568">What then is to be done ? Be wise with speed ;</l>
     <l n="569">A fool at forty is a fool indeed .</l>
     <l n="570">And what so foolish as the chance of fame ?</l>
     <l n="571">How vain the prize ! how impotent our aim !</l>
     <l n="572">For what are men who grasp at praise sublime ,</l>
     <l n="573">But bubbles on the rapid stream of time ,</l>
     <l n="574">That rise , and fall , that swell , and are no more ,</l>
     <l n="575">Born , and forgot , ten thousand in an hour ?</l>

     <l n="577">To the Right Honorable Mr. Dodington .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="578">Long , Dodington , in debt , I long have sought</l>
     <l n="579">To ease the burthen of my grateful thought ;</l>
     <l n="580">And now a poet ’ s gratitude you see ;</l>
     <l n="581">Grant him two favours , and he ’ ll ask for three :</l>
     <l n="582">For whose the present glory , or the gain ?</l>
     <l n="583">You give protection , I a worthless strain .</l>
     <l n="584">You love and feel the poet ’ s sacred flame ;</l>
     <l n="585">And know the basis of a solid fame ;</l>
     <l n="586">Tho ’ prone to like , yet cautious to commend ,</l>
     <l n="587">You read with all the malice of a friend ;</l>
     <l n="588">Nor favour my attempts that way alone ,</l>
     <l n="589">But , more to raise my verse , conceal your own .</l>
     <l n="590">An ill-tim ’ d modesty ! turn ages o ’ er ,</l>
     <l n="591">When wanted Britain bright examples more ?</l>
     <l n="592">Her learning , and her genius too , decays ,</l>
     <l n="593">And dark and cold are her declining days ;</l>
     <l n="594">As if men now were of another cast ,</l>
     <l n="595">They meanly live on alms of ages past .</l>
     <l n="596">Men still are men ; and they who boldly dare ,</l>
     <l n="597">Shall triumph o ’ er the sons of cold despair ;</l>
     <l n="598">Or , if they fail , they justly still take place</l>
     <l n="599">Of such who run in debt for their disgrace ;</l>
     <l n="600">Who borrow much , then fairly make it known ,</l>
     <l n="601">And damn it with improvements of their own .</l>
     <l n="602">We bring some new materials , and what ’ s old</l>
     <l n="603">New cast with care , and in no borrow ’ d mould ;</l>
     <l n="604">Late times the verse may read , if these refuse ;</l>
     <l n="605">And from sour critics vindicate the muse .</l>
     <l n="606">“ Your work is long , ” the critics cry . “ Tis true ,</l>
     <l n="607">And lengthens still , to take in fools like you :</l>
     <l n="608">Shorten my labour , if its length you blame ;</l>
     <l n="609">For , grow but wise , you rob me of my game ;</l>
     <l n="610">As hunted hags , who , while the dogs pursue ,</l>
     <l n="611">Renounce their four legs , and start up on two .</l>
     <l n="612">Like the bold bird upon the banks of Nile ,</l>
     <l n="613">That picks the teeth of the dire crocodile ,</l>
     <l n="614">Will I enjoy , ( dread feast ! ) the critic ’ s rage ,</l>
     <l n="615">And with the fell destroyer feed my page .</l>
     <l n="616">For what ambitious fools are more to blame ,</l>
     <l n="617">Than those who thunder in the critic ’ s name ?</l>
     <l n="618">Good authors damn ’ d , have their revenge in this ,</l>
     <l n="619">To see what wretches gain the praise they miss .</l>
     <l n="620">Balbutius , muffled in his sable cloak ,</l>
     <l n="621">Like an old Druid from his hollow oak ,</l>
     <l n="622">As ravens solemn , and as boding , cries ,</l>
     <l n="623">“ Ten thousand worlds for the three unities ! ”</l>
     <l n="624">Ye doctors sage , who thro ’ Parnassus teach ,</l>

     <l n="626">One judges as the weather dictates ; right</l>

     <l n="628">Another judges by a surer gage ,</l>
     <l n="629">An author ’ s principles , or parentage ;</l>
     <l n="630">Since his great ancestors in Flanders fell ,</l>

     <l n="634">Some judge , their knack of judging wrong to keep ;</l>
     <l n="635">Some judge , because it is too soon to sleep .</l>
     <l n="636">Thus all will judge , and with one single aim ,</l>
     <l n="637">To gain themselves , not give the writer , fame .</l>

     <l n="639">Half to serve you , and half to pass for wise .</l>
     <l n="640">Critics on verse , as squibs on triumphs wait ,</l>

     <l n="645">Than Compton ’ s smile , and your obliging frown ?</l>
     <l n="646">Not all on books their criticism waste :</l>
     <l n="647">The genius of a dish some justly taste ,</l>
     <l n="648">And eat their way to fame ; with anxious thought</l>
     <l n="649">The salmon is refus ’ d , the turbot bought .</l>
     <l n="650">Impatient art rebukes the sun ’ s delay ,</l>
     <l n="651">And bids December yield the fruits of May ;</l>

     <l n="653">The business of their lives , that is — to dine .</l>
     <l n="654">Half of their precious day they give the feast ;</l>

     <l n="656">Apicius , here , the taster of the town ,</l>
     <l n="657">Feeds twice a week , to settle their renown .</l>
     <l n="658">These worthies of the palate guard with care</l>
     <l n="659">The sacred annals of their bills of fare ;</l>
     <l n="660">In those choice books their panegyrics read ,</l>
     <l n="661">And scorn the creatures that for hunger feed .</l>
     <l n="662">If man by feeding well commences great ,</l>
     <l n="663">Much more the worm to whom that man is meat .</l>
     <l n="664">To glory some advance a lying claim ,</l>

     <l n="679">And takes a memorandum to forget .</l>
     <l n="680">Thus vain , not knowing what adorns , or blots ,</l>
     <l n="681">Men forge the patents , that create them sots .</l>

     <l n="684">But whence for praise can such an ardour rise ,</l>
     <l n="685">When those , who bring that incense , we despise ?</l>
     <l n="686">For such the vanity of great and small ,</l>
     <l n="687">Contempt goes round , and all men laugh at all .</l>
     <l n="688">Nor can ev ’ n satire blame them ; for , ’ tis true ,</l>
     <l n="689">They have most ample cause for what they do .</l>
     <l n="690">O fruitful Britain ! doubtless thou wast meant</l>
     <l n="691">A nurse of fools , to stock the continent .</l>
     <l n="692">Tho ’ Phœbus and the Nine for ever mow ,</l>

     <l n="696">A Welsh descent , which well paid heralds damn ;</l>
     <l n="697">Or , longer still , a Dutchman ’ s epigram .</l>
     <l n="698">When , cloy ’ d , in fury I throw down my pen ,</l>

     <l n="700">See Tityrus , with merriment possest ,</l>
     <l n="701">Is burst with laughter , ere he hears the jest :</l>
     <l n="702">What need he stay ? for when the joke is o ’ er ,</l>
     <l n="703">His teeth will be no whiter than before .</l>
     <l n="704">Is there of these , ye fair ! so great a dearth ,</l>
     <l n="705">That you need purchase monkeys for your mirth ?</l>
     <l n="706">Some , vain of paintings , bid the world admire ;</l>

     <l n="708">Some ( perfect wisdom ! ) of a beauteous wife ;</l>
     <l n="709">And boast , like Cordeliers , a scourge for life .</l>
     <l n="710">Sometimes , thro ’ pride , the sexes change their airs ;</l>
     <l n="711">My lord has vapours , and my lady swears ;</l>
     <l n="712">Then , stranger still ! on turning of the wind ,</l>
     <l n="713">My lord wears breeches , and my lady ’ s kind .</l>
     <l n="714">To show the strength , and infamy of pride ,</l>
     <l n="715">By all ’ tis follow ’ d , and by all denied .</l>
     <l n="716">What numbers are there , which at once pursue</l>
     <l n="717">Praise , and the glory to contemn it , too !</l>
     <l n="718">Vincenna knows self-praise betrays to shame ,</l>
     <l n="719">And therefore lays a stratagem for fame ;</l>
     <l n="720">Makes his approach in modesty ’ s disguise ,</l>
     <l n="721">To win applause ; and takes it by surprise .</l>
     <l n="722">“ To err , ” says he , “ in small things , is my fate . ”</l>
     <l n="723">You know your answer , he ’ s exact in great .</l>
     <l n="724">“ My style , ” says he , “ is rude and full of faults . ”</l>
     <l n="725">But oh ! what sense ! what energy of thoughts !</l>
     <l n="726">That he wants algebra , he must confess ;</l>
     <l n="727">But not a soul to give our arms success .</l>
     <l n="728">“ Ah ; that ’ s a hit indeed , ” Vincenna cries ;</l>
     <l n="729">“ But who in heat of blood was ever wise ?</l>
     <l n="730">I own ’ twas wrong , when thousands call ’ d me back ,</l>
     <l n="731">To make that hopeless , ill-advis ’ d attack ;</l>
     <l n="732">All say , ’ twas madness ; nor dare I deny ;</l>
     <l n="733">Sure never fool so well deserv ’ d to die . ”</l>
     <l n="734">Could this deceive in others , to be free ,</l>
     <l n="735">It ne ’ er , Vincenna , could deceive in thee ;</l>
     <l n="736">Whose conduct is a comment to thy tongue ,</l>
     <l n="737">So clear , the dullest cannot take thee wrong .</l>
     <l n="738">Thou on one sleeve wilt thy revenues wear ;</l>
     <l n="739">And haunt the court , without a prospect there .</l>
     <l n="740">Are these expedients for renown ? Confess</l>
     <l n="741">Thy little self , that I may scorn thee less .</l>
     <l n="742">Be wise , Vincenna , and the court forsake ;</l>
     <l n="743">Our fortunes there , nor thou , nor I , shall make .</l>
     <l n="744">Ev ’ n men of merit , ere their point they gain ,</l>
     <l n="745">In hardy service make a long campaign ;</l>
     <l n="746">Most manfully besiege their patron ’ s gate ,</l>
     <l n="747">And oft repuls ’ d , as oft attack the great</l>
     <l n="748">With painful art , and application warm ,</l>
     <l n="749">And take , at last , some little place by storm ;</l>
     <l n="750">Enough to keep two shoes on Sunday clean ,</l>
     <l n="751">And starve upon discreetly , in Sheer Lane .</l>
     <l n="752">Already this thy fortune can afford ;</l>
     <l n="753">Then starve without the favour of my lord .</l>
     <l n="754">’ Tis true , great fortunes some great men confer ;</l>
     <l n="755">But often , ev ’ n in doing right , they err :</l>
     <l n="756">From caprice , not from choice , their favours come ;</l>
     <l n="757">They give , but think it toil to know to whom :</l>
     <l n="758">The man that ’ s nearest , yawning , they advance :</l>
     <l n="759">’ Tis inhumanity to bless by chance .</l>
     <l n="760">If merit sues , and greatness is so loth</l>
     <l n="761">To break its downy trance , I pity both .</l>
     <l n="762">I grant at court , Philander , at his need ,</l>
     <l n="763">( Thanks to his lovely wife ) finds friends indeed .</l>
     <l n="764">Of every charm and virtue she ’ s possest :</l>
     <l n="765">Philander ! thou art exquisitely blest ;</l>
     <l n="766">The public envy ! Now then , ’ tis allow ’ d ,</l>
     <l n="767">The man is found , who may be justly proud :</l>
     <l n="768">But , see ! how sickly is ambition ’ s taste !</l>
     <l n="769">Ambition feeds on trash , and loaths a feast ;</l>
     <l n="770">For , lo ! Philander , of reproach afraid ,</l>
     <l n="771">In secret loves his wife , but keeps her maid .</l>
     <l n="772">Some nymphs sell reputation ; others buy ;</l>
     <l n="773">And love a market where the rates run high :</l>
     <l n="774">Italian music ’ s sweet , because ’ tis dear ;</l>
     <l n="775">Their vanity is tickled , not their ear :</l>
     <l n="776">Their taste would lessen , if the prices fell ,</l>
     <l n="777">And Shakespeare ’ s wretched stuff do quite as well ;</l>
     <l n="778">Away the disenchanted fair would throng ,</l>
     <l n="779">And own that English is their mother tongue .</l>
     <l n="780">To show how much our northern tastes refine ,</l>
     <l n="781">Imported nymphs our peeresses outshine ;</l>
     <l n="782">While tradesmen starve , these Philomels are gay ;</l>
     <l n="783">For generous lords had rather give than pay .</l>
     <l n="784">Behold the masquerade ’ s fantastic scene !</l>
     <l n="785">The legislature join ’ d with Drury Lane !</l>
     <l n="786">When Britain calls , th ’ embroider ’ d patriots run ,</l>
     <l n="787">And serve their country — if the dance is done .</l>
     <l n="788">“ Are we not then allow ’ d to be polite ? ”</l>
     <l n="789">Yes , doubtless ; but first set your notions right .</l>
     <l n="790">Worth , of politeness , is the needful ground ;</l>
     <l n="791">Where that is wanting , this can ne ’ er be found .</l>
     <l n="792">Triflers not e ’ en in trifles can excel ;</l>
     <l n="793">’ Tis solid bodies only polish well .</l>
     <l n="794">Great , chosen prophet ! For these latter days ,</l>
     <l n="795">To turn a willing world from righteous ways !</l>
     <l n="796">Well , Heydegger , dost thou thy master serve ;</l>
     <l n="797">Well has he seen his servant should not starve .</l>
     <l n="798">Thou to his name hast splendid temples rais ’ d ;</l>
     <l n="799">In various forms of worship seen him prais ’ d ,</l>
     <l n="800">Gaudy devotion , like a Roman , shown ,</l>
     <l n="801">And sung sweet anthems in a tongue unknown .</l>
     <l n="802">Inferior off ’ rings to thy god of vice</l>
     <l n="803">Are duly paid , in fiddles , cards , and dice ;</l>
     <l n="804">Thy sacrifice supreme , a hundred maids !</l>
     <l n="805">That solemn rite of midnight masquerades !</l>
     <l n="806">If maids the quite exhausted town denies ,</l>
     <l n="807">A hundred heads of cuckolds may suffice .</l>
     <l n="808">Thou smil ’ st , well pleas ’ d with the converted land ,</l>
     <l n="809">To see the fifty churches at a stand .</l>
     <l n="810">And that thy minister may never fail ,</l>

     <l n="812">Of minor prophets a succession sure</l>
     <l n="813">The propagation of thy zeal secure .</l>
     <l n="814">See commons , peers , and ministers of state ,</l>
     <l n="815">In solemn council met , and deep debate !</l>
     <l n="816">What godlike enterprise is taking birth ?</l>
     <l n="817">What wonder opens on th ’ expecting earth ?</l>
     <l n="818">’ Tis done ! with loud applause the council rings !</l>
     <l n="819">Fix ’ d is the fate of whores and fiddle-strings !</l>
     <l n="820">Tho ’ bold these truths , thou , muse , with truths like these ,</l>
     <l n="821">Wilt none offend , whom ’ tis a praise to please :</l>
     <l n="822">Let others flatter to be flatter ’ d , thou ,</l>
     <l n="823">Like just tribunals , bend an awful brow .</l>
     <l n="824">How terrible it were to common sense ,</l>
     <l n="825">To write a satire , which gave none offence !</l>
     <l n="826">And , since from life I take the draughts you see ,</l>
     <l n="827">If men dislike them , do they censure me ?</l>
     <l n="828">The fool , and knave , ’ tis glorious to offend ,</l>
     <l n="829">And godlike an attempt the world to mend ;</l>
     <l n="830">The world , where lucky throws to blockheads fall ,</l>
     <l n="831">Knaves know the game , and honest men pay all .</l>
     <l n="832">How hard for real worth to gain its price !</l>
     <l n="833">A man shall make his fortune in a trice ,</l>

     <l n="836">A supple knee , smooth tongue , an easy grace ,</l>

     <l n="838">A beauteous sister , or convenient wife ,</l>
     <l n="839">Are prizes in the lottery of life ;</l>
     <l n="840">Genius and virtue they will soon defeat ,</l>
     <l n="841">And lodge you in the bosom of the great .</l>
     <l n="842">To merit , is but to provide a pain</l>
     <l n="843">For men ’ s refusing what you ought to gain .</l>
     <l n="844">May , Dodington , this maxim fail in you ,</l>

     <l n="926">His character and gloves are ever clean ,</l>
     <l n="927">And then , he can out-bow the bowing dean ;</l>
     <l n="928">A smile eternal on his lip he wears ,</l>
     <l n="929">Which equally the wise and worthless shares .</l>
     <l n="930">In gay fatigues , this most undaunted chief ,</l>
     <l n="931">Patient of idleness beyond belief ,</l>
     <l n="932">Most charitably lends the town his face ,</l>
     <l n="933">For ornament , in ev ’ ry public place ;</l>
     <l n="934">As sure as cards , he to th ’ assembly comes ,</l>
     <l n="935">And is the furniture of drawing-rooms :</l>
     <l n="936">When ombre calls , his hand and heart are free ,</l>
     <l n="937">And , join ’ d to two , he fails not — to make three :</l>
     <l n="938">Narcissus is the glory of his race ;</l>
     <l n="939">For who does nothing with a better grace ?</l>
     <l n="940">To deck my list , by nature were design ’ d</l>
     <l n="941">Such shining expletives of human kind ,</l>
     <l n="942">Who want , while thro ’ blank life they dream along ,</l>
     <l n="943">Sense to be right , and passion to be wrong .</l>
     <l n="944">To counterpoise this hero of the mode ,</l>
     <l n="945">Some for renown are singular and odd ;</l>
     <l n="946">What other men dislike , is sure to please ,</l>
     <l n="947">Of all mankind , these dear antipodes ;</l>
     <l n="948">Thro ’ pride , not malice , they run counter still ,</l>
     <l n="949">And birthdays are their days of dressing ill ,</l>
     <l n="950">Arbuthnot is a fool , and F —— a sage ,</l>

     <l n="952">By nature streams run backward , flame descends ,</l>
     <l n="953">Stones mount , and Sussex is the worst of friends ;</l>
     <l n="954">They take their rest by day , and wake by night ,</l>

     <l n="958">Nothing exceeds in ridicule , no doubt ,</l>
     <l n="959">A fool in fashion , but a fool that ’ s out ,</l>
     <l n="960">His passion for absurdity ’ s so strong ,</l>
     <l n="961">He cannot bear a rival in the wrong ;</l>
     <l n="962">Tho ’ wrong the mode , comply ; more sense is shown</l>
     <l n="963">In wearing others ’ follies , than your own .</l>
     <l n="964">If what is out of fashion most you prize ,</l>
     <l n="965">Methinks you should endeavour to be wise .</l>
     <l n="966">But what in oddness can be more sublime</l>
     <l n="967">Than Sloane , the foremost toyman of his time ?</l>
     <l n="968">His nice ambition lies in curious fancies ,</l>
     <l n="969">His daughter ’ s portion a rich shell inhances ,</l>
     <l n="970">And Ashmole ’ s baby-house is , in his view ,</l>

     <l n="982">Not gaudy butterflies are Lico ’ s game ;</l>
     <l n="983">But , in effect , his chase is much the same ;</l>
     <l n="984">Warm in pursuit , he levees all the great ,</l>

     <l n="988">He sets them sure , where ’ er their lordships run ,</l>
     <l n="989">Close at their elbows , as a morning dun ;</l>
     <l n="990">As if their grandeur , by contagion , wrought ,</l>
     <l n="991">And fame was , like a fever , to be caught :</l>

     <l n="993">The ( 13 ) Dane is more familiar with his grace .</l>
     <l n="994">Who ’ d be a crutch to prop a rotten peer ;</l>

     <l n="997">For months before , by trumpets , thro ’ the town ?</l>
     <l n="998">Who ’ d be a glass , with flattering grimace ,</l>

     <l n="1005">When the peer rashly swears he ’ ll club his joke ?</l>
     <l n="1006">Who ’ d shake with laughter , tho ’ he could not find</l>

     <l n="1008">For blessings to the gods profoundly bow ,</l>
     <l n="1009">That can cry , chimney sweep , or drive a plough ?</l>
     <l n="1010">With terms like these , how mean the tribe that close !</l>
     <l n="1011">Scarce meaner they , who terms like these , impose .</l>
     <l n="1012">But what ’ s the tribe most likely to comply ?</l>
     <l n="1013">The men of ink , or ancient authors lie ;</l>
     <l n="1014">The writing tribe , who shameless auctions hold</l>
     <l n="1015">Of praise , by inch of candle to be sold :</l>
     <l n="1016">All men they flatter , but themselves the most ,</l>
     <l n="1017">With deathless fame , their everlasting boast :</l>
     <l n="1018">For fame no cully makes so much her jest ,</l>
     <l n="1019">As her old constant spark , the bard profest .</l>
     <l n="1020">“ Boyle shines in council , Mordaunt in the fight ,</l>

     <l n="1032">What foe to verse without compassion hears ,</l>
     <l n="1033">What cruel prose-man can refrain from tears ,</l>
     <l n="1034">When the poor muse , for less than half a crown ,</l>

     <l n="1042">Bad metre , that excrescence of the head ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Nor reigns ambition in bold man alone ;</l>
     <l n="2">Soft female hearts the rude invader own :</l>
     <l n="3">But there , indeed , it deals in nicer things ,</l>
     <l n="4">Than routing armies , and dethroning kings :</l>
     <l n="5">Attend , and you discern it in the fair</l>
     <l n="6">Conduct a finger , or reclaim a hair ;</l>
     <l n="7">Or roll the lucid orbit of an eye ;</l>
     <l n="8">Or , in full joy , elaborate a sigh .</l>
     <l n="9">The sex we honour , tho ’ their faults we blame ;</l>
     <l n="10">Nay , thank their faults for such a fruitful theme :</l>
     <l n="11">A theme , fair ——! doubly kind to me ,</l>
     <l n="12">Since satirizing those is praising thee ;</l>
     <l n="13">Who wouldst not bear , too modestly refin ’ d ,</l>
     <l n="14">A panegyric of a grosser kind .</l>
     <l n="15">Britannia ’ s daughters , much more fair than nice ,</l>
     <l n="16">Too fond of admiration , lose their price ;</l>
     <l n="17">Worn in the public eye , give cheap delight</l>
     <l n="18">To throngs , and tarnish to the sated sight :</l>
     <l n="19">As unreserv ’ d , and beauteous , as the sun ,</l>
     <l n="20">Through every sign of vanity they run ;</l>
     <l n="21">Assemblies , parks , coarse feasts in city-halls ,</l>
     <l n="22">Lectures , and trials , plays , committees , balls ,</l>
     <l n="23">Wells , bedlams , executions , Smithfield scenes ,</l>
     <l n="24">And fortune-tellers ’ caves , and lions ’ dens ,</l>
     <l n="25">Taverns , exchanges , bridewells , drawing-rooms ,</l>
     <l n="26">Installments , pillories , coronations , tombs ,</l>
     <l n="27">Tumblers , and funerals , puppet-shows , reviews ,</l>
     <l n="28">Sales , races , rabbits , ( and still stranger ! ) pews .</l>
     <l n="29">Clarinda ’ s bosom burns , but burns for fame ;</l>
     <l n="30">And love lies vanquished in a nobler flame ;</l>
     <l n="31">Warm gleams of hope she , now , dispenses ; then ,</l>
     <l n="32">Like April suns , dives into clouds again :</l>
     <l n="33">With all her lustre , now , her lover warms ;</l>
     <l n="34">Then , out of ostentation , hides her charms :</l>
     <l n="35">’ Tis , next , her pleasure sweetly to complain ,</l>
     <l n="36">And to be taken with a sudden pain ;</l>
     <l n="37">Then , she starts up , all ecstasy and bliss ,</l>
     <l n="38">And is , sweet soul ! just as sincere in this :</l>
     <l n="39">O how she rolls her charming eyes in spite !</l>
     <l n="40">And looks delightfully with all her might !</l>
     <l n="41">But , like our heroes , much more brave than wise ,</l>
     <l n="42">She conquers for the triumph , not the prize .</l>
     <l n="43">Zara resembles Ætna crown ’ d with snows ;</l>
     <l n="44">Without she freezes , and within she glows :</l>
     <l n="45">Twice ere the sun descends , with zeal inspir ’ d ,</l>
     <l n="46">From the vain converse of the world retir ’ d ,</l>
     <l n="47">She reads the psalms and chapters for the day ,</l>
     <l n="48">In —— Cleopatra , or the last new play .</l>
     <l n="49">Thus gloomy Zara , with a solemn grace ,</l>
     <l n="50">Deceives mankind , and hides behind her face .</l>
     <l n="51">Nor far beneath her in renown , is she ,</l>
     <l n="52">Who , through good breeding , is ill company ;</l>
     <l n="53">Whose manners will not let her larum cease ,</l>
     <l n="54">Who thinks you are unhappy , when at peace ;</l>
     <l n="55">To find you news , who racks her subtle head ,</l>
     <l n="56">And vows — that her great-grandfather is dead .</l>
     <l n="57">A dearth of words a woman need not fear ,</l>
     <l n="58">But ’ tis a task indeed to learn — to hear :</l>
     <l n="59">In that the skill of conversation lies ;</l>
     <l n="60">That shows , or makes , you both polite and wise .</l>
     <l n="61">Xantippe cries , “ Let nymphs , who nought can say ,</l>
     <l n="62">Be lost in silence , and resign the day ;</l>
     <l n="63">And let the guilty wife her guilt confess ,</l>
     <l n="64">By tame behaviour , and a soft address ; ”</l>
     <l n="65">Through virtue , she refuses to comply</l>
     <l n="66">With all the dictates of humanity ;</l>
     <l n="67">Through wisdom , she refuses to submit</l>
     <l n="68">To wisdom ’ s rules , and raves to prove her wit ;</l>
     <l n="69">Then , her unblemish ’ d honour to maintain ,</l>
     <l n="70">Rejects her husband ’ s kindness with disdain :</l>
     <l n="71">But if , by chance , an ill-adapted word</l>
     <l n="72">Drops from the lip of her unwary lord ,</l>
     <l n="73">Her darling china , in a whirlwind sent ,</l>
     <l n="74">Just intimates the lady ’ s discontent .</l>
     <l n="75">Wine may indeed excite the meekest dame ;</l>
     <l n="76">But keen Xantippe , scorning borrow ’ d flame ,</l>
     <l n="77">Can vent her thunders , and her lightnings play ,</l>
     <l n="78">O ’ er cooling gruel , and composing tea :</l>
     <l n="79">Nor rests by night , but , more sincere than nice ,</l>
     <l n="80">She shakes the curtains with her kind advice :</l>
     <l n="81">Doubly , like echo , sound is her delight ,</l>
     <l n="82">And the last word is her eternal right .</l>
     <l n="83">Is ’ t not enough , plagues , wars , and famines rise</l>
     <l n="84">To lash our crimes , but must our wives be wise ?</l>
     <l n="85">Famine , plague , war , and an unnumber ’ d throng</l>
     <l n="86">Of guilt-avenging ills , to man belong :</l>
     <l n="87">What black , what ceaseless cares besiege our state !</l>
     <l n="88">What strokes we feel from fancy , and from fate !</l>
     <l n="89">If fate forbears us , fancy strikes the blow ;</l>

     <l n="395">Whatever fortune lavishly can pour ,</l>
     <l n="396">The mind annihilates , and calls for more !</l>
     <l n="397">Wealth is a cheat ; believe not what it says ;</l>

     <l n="400">Of such a wonder , as insolvent gold !</l>
     <l n="401">What nature wants has an intrinsic weight ;</l>
     <l n="402">All more , is but the fashion of the plate ,</l>

     <l n="409">The fair , ’ tis true , by genius should be won ,</l>
     <l n="410">As flow ’ rs unfold their beauties to the sun ;</l>
     <l n="411">And yet in female scales a fop outweighs ,</l>
     <l n="412">And wit must wear the willow and the bays .</l>
     <l n="413">Nought shines so bright in vain Liberia ’ s eye</l>

     <l n="23">She decently , in form , pays heaven its due ;</l>
     <l n="24">And makes a civil visit to her pew .</l>
     <l n="25">Her lifted fan , to give a solemn air ,</l>

     <l n="54">First make your will , and then converse with her .</l>

     <l n="63">Flavia is constant to her old gallant ,</l>
     <l n="64">And generously supports him in his want ;</l>

     <l n="76">Nor would they be mistaken , if they should .</l>
     <l n="77">Unmarried Abra puts on formal airs ;</l>
     <l n="78">Her cushion ’ s threadbare with her constant prayers .</l>
     <l n="79">Her only grief is , that she cannot be</l>
     <l n="80">At once engag ’ d in prayer and charity .</l>
     <l n="81">And this , to do her justice , must be said ,</l>
     <l n="82">“ Who would not think that Abra was a maid ? ”</l>
     <l n="83">Some ladies are too beauteous to be wed ;</l>

     <l n="85">If no disease reduce her pride before ,</l>
     <l n="86">Lavinia will be ravish ’ d at threescore .</l>
     <l n="87">Then she submits to venture in the dark ;</l>
     <l n="88">And nothing now is wanting — but her spark .</l>
     <l n="89">Lucia thinks happiness consists in state ;</l>
     <l n="90">She weds an idiot , but she eats in plate .</l>
     <l n="91">The goods of fortune , which her soul possess ,</l>
     <l n="92">Are but the ground of unmade happiness ;</l>
     <l n="93">The rude material : wisdom add to this ,</l>
     <l n="94">Wisdom , the sole artificer of bliss ;</l>
     <l n="95">She from herself , if so compell ’ d by need ,</l>
     <l n="96">Of thin content can draw the subtle thread ;</l>
     <l n="97">But ( no detraction to her sacred skill )</l>
     <l n="98">If she can work in gold , ’ tis better still .</l>
     <l n="99">If Tullia had been blest with half her sense ,</l>
     <l n="100">None could too much admire her excellence :</l>
     <l n="101">But since she can make error shine so bright ,</l>
     <l n="102">She thinks it vulgar to defend the right .</l>
     <l n="103">With understanding she is quite o ’ errun ;</l>
     <l n="104">And by too great accomplishments undone :</l>
     <l n="105">With skill she vibrates her eternal tongue ,</l>
     <l n="106">For ever most divinely in the wrong .</l>
     <l n="107">Naked in nothing should a woman be ;</l>
     <l n="108">But veil her very wit with modesty :</l>
     <l n="109">Let man discover , let not her display ,</l>
     <l n="110">But yield her charms of mind with sweet delay .</l>
     <l n="111">For pleasure form ’ d , perversely some believe ,</l>
     <l n="112">To make themselves important , men must grieve .</l>
     <l n="113">Lesbia the fair , to fire her jealous lord ,</l>
     <l n="114">Pretends , the fop she laughs at , is ador ’ d .</l>
     <l n="115">In vain she ’ s proud of secret innocence ;</l>

     <l n="120">At small inquietudes in her he lov ’ d .</l>
     <l n="121">“ How charming this ! "— The pleasure lasted long ;</l>
     <l n="122">Now every day the fits come thick and strong :</l>
     <l n="123">At last he found the charmer only feign ’ d ;</l>
     <l n="124">And was diverted when he should be pain ’ d .</l>
     <l n="125">What greater vengeance had the gods in store ?</l>
     <l n="126">How tedious life , now she can plague no more !</l>
     <l n="127">She tries a thousand arts ; but none succeed :</l>
     <l n="128">She ’ s forc ’ d a fever to procure indeed :</l>
     <l n="129">Thus strictly prov ’ d this virtuous , loving wife ,</l>
     <l n="130">Her husband ’ s pain was dearer than her life .</l>
     <l n="131">Anxious Melania rises to my view ,</l>

     <l n="133">Visit , present , treat , flatter , and adore ;</l>
     <l n="134">Her majesty , to-morrow , calls for more .</l>
     <l n="135">His wounded ears complaints eternal fill ,</l>

     <l n="137">“ You went last night with Celia to the ball . ”</l>
     <l n="138">You prove it false . “ Not go ! that ’ s worst of all . ”</l>
     <l n="139">Nothing can please her , nothing not inflame ;</l>
     <l n="140">And arrant contradictions are the same .</l>
     <l n="141">Her lover must be sad , to please her spleen ;</l>
     <l n="142">His mirth is an inexpiable sin :</l>
     <l n="143">For of all rivals that can pain her breast ,</l>
     <l n="144">There ’ s one , that wounds far deeper than the rest ;</l>
     <l n="145">To wreck her quiet , the most dreadful shelf</l>
     <l n="146">Is if her lover dares enjoy himself .</l>
     <l n="147">And this , because she ’ s exquisitely fair :</l>
     <l n="148">Should I dispute her beauty , how she ’ d stare !</l>
     <l n="149">How would Melania be surpris ’ d to hear</l>
     <l n="150">She ’ s quite deform ’ d ! And yet the case is clear ;</l>
     <l n="151">What ’ s female beauty , but an air divine ,</l>
     <l n="152">Thro ’ which the mind ’ s all gentle graces shine ?</l>
     <l n="153">They , like the sun , irradiate all between ;</l>
     <l n="154">The body charms because the soul is seen .</l>
     <l n="155">Hence , men are often captives of a face ,</l>
     <l n="156">They know not why , of no peculiar grace :</l>

     <l n="167">Heaven by its favour has the fair distrest ,</l>
     <l n="168">And pour ’ d such blessings — that she can ’ t be blest .</l>
     <l n="169">Ah ! why so vain , though blooming in thy spring ,</l>
     <l n="170">Thou shining , frail , ador ’ d , and wretched thing ?</l>
     <l n="171">Old age will come ; disease may come before ;</l>

     <l n="173">Thy fortune , and thy charms , may soon decay :</l>
     <l n="174">But grant these fugitives prolong their stay ,</l>
     <l n="175">Their basis totters , their foundation shakes ;</l>
     <l n="176">Life , that supports them , in a moment breaks ;</l>
     <l n="177">Then wrought into the soul let virtues shine ;</l>
     <l n="178">The ground eternal , as the work divine .</l>
     <l n="179">Julia ’ s a manager ; she ’ s born for rule ;</l>
     <l n="180">And knows her wiser husband is a fool ;</l>
     <l n="181">Assemblies holds , and spins the subtle thread</l>
     <l n="182">That guides the lover to his fair one ’ s bed :</l>
     <l n="183">For difficult amours can smooth the way ,</l>

     <l n="187">For her own breakfast she ’ ll project a scheme ,</l>
     <l n="188">Nor take her tea without a stratagem ;</l>
     <l n="189">Presides o ’ er trifles with a serious face ;</l>
     <l n="190">Important by the virtue of grimace .</l>
     <l n="191">Ladies supreme among amusements reign ;</l>
     <l n="192">By nature born to soothe , and entertain .</l>
     <l n="193">Their prudence in a share of folly lies :</l>
     <l n="194">Why will they be so weak , as to be wise ?</l>
     <l n="195">Syrena is for ever in extremes ,</l>
     <l n="196">And with a vengeance she commends , or blames .</l>
     <l n="197">Conscious of her discernment , which is good ,</l>
     <l n="198">She strains too much to make it understood .</l>
     <l n="199">Her judgment just , her sentence is too strong ;</l>
     <l n="200">Because she ’ s right , she ’ s ever in the wrong .</l>
     <l n="201">Brunetta ’ s wise in actions great , and rare ;</l>
     <l n="202">But scorns on trifles to bestow her care .</l>
     <l n="203">Thus ev ’ ry hour Brunetta is to blame ,</l>
     <l n="204">Because th ’ occasion is beneath her aim ,</l>
     <l n="205">Think nought a trifle , though it small appear ;</l>
     <l n="206">Small sands the mountain , moments make the year ,</l>
     <l n="207">And trifles life . Your care to trifles give ,</l>
     <l n="208">Or you may die , before you truly live .</l>
     <l n="209">Go breakfast with Alicia , there you ’ ll see ,</l>

     <l n="213">She drawls her words , and waddles in her pace ;</l>

     <l n="215">A nail uncut , and head uncomb ’ d , she loves ;</l>

     <l n="235">The breath of others raises our renown ;</l>

     <l n="246">No rivals rais ’ d by such discreet applause ;</l>
     <l n="247">And yet , of credit it lays in a store ,</l>
     <l n="248">By which our spleen may wound true worth the more .</l>
     <l n="249">Ladies there are who think one crime is all :</l>
     <l n="250">Can women , then , no way but backward fall ?</l>
     <l n="251">So sweet is that one crime they don ’ t pursue ,</l>
     <l n="252">To pay its loss , they think all others few .</l>
     <l n="253">Who hold that crime so dear , must never claim</l>
     <l n="254">Of injur ’ d modesty the sacred name .</l>
     <l n="255">But Clio thus : “ What ! railing without end ?</l>
     <l n="256">Mean task ! how much more gen ’ rous to commend ! ”</l>

     <l n="307">See how they beg an alms of flattery !</l>
     <l n="308">They languish ! oh support them with a lie !</l>
     <l n="309">A decent competence we fully taste ;</l>
     <l n="310">It strikes our sense , and gives a constant feast :</l>
     <l n="311">More , we perceive by dint of thought alone ;</l>

   <p>I think myself obliged to recommend to you a consideration of the greatest importance ; and I should look upon it as a great happiness , if , at the beginning of my reign , I could see the foundation laid of so great and necessary a work , as the increase and encouragement of our seamen in general ; that they may be invited , rather than compelled by force and violence , to enter into the service of their country , as oft as occasion shall require it : a consideration worthy the representatives of a people great and flourishing in trade and navigation . This leads me to mention to you the case of Greenwich Hospital , that care may be taken , by some addition to that fund , to render comfortable and effectual that charitable provision , for the support and maintenance of our seamen , worn out , and become decrepit by age and infirmities , in the service of their country .</p>

     <l n="67">On Lyric Poetry .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>How imperfect soever my own composition may be , yet am I willing to speak a word or two , of the nature of lyric poetry ; to show that I have , at least , some idea of perfection in that kind of poem in which I am engaged ; and that I do not think myself poet enough entirely to rely on inspiration for success in it .</p>
   <p>To our having , or not having , this idea of perfection in the poem we undertake , is chiefly owing the merit or demerit of our performances , as also the modesty or vanity of our opinions concerning them . And in speaking of it I shall show how it unavoidably comes to pass , that bad poets , that is , poets in general , are esteemed , and really are , the most vain , the most irritable , and most ridiculous set of men upon earth . But poetry in its own nature is certainly</p>
   <p>Non hos quæsitum munus in usus .</p>
   <p>— VIRG .</p>
   <p>He that has an idea of perfection in the work he undertakes may fail in it ; he that has not , must : and yet he will be vain . For every little degree of beauty , how short or improper soever , will be looked on fondly by him ; because it is all pure gains , and more than he promised to himself ; and because he has no test , or standard in his judgment , with which to chastise his opinion of it .</p>
   <p>Now this idea of perfection is , in poetry , more refined than in other kinds of writing ; and because more refined , therefore more difficult ; and because more difficult , therefore more rarely attained ; and the non-attainment of it is , as I have said , the source of our vanity . Hence the poetic clan are more obnoxious to vanity than others . And from vanity consequently flows that great sensibility of disrespect , that quick resentment , that tinder of the mind that kindles at every spark , and justly marks them out for the genus irritabile among mankind . And from this combustible temper , this serious anger for no very serious things , things looked on by most as foreign to the important points of life , as consequentially flows that inheritance of ridicule , which devolves on them , from generation to generation . As soon as they become authors , they become like Ben Jonson ’ s angry boy , and learn the art of quarrel .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Concordes animæ — dum nocte prementur ;</l>
     <l n="2">Heu ! quantum inter se bellum , si lumina vitæ</l>
     <l n="3">Attigerint , quantas acies stragemque ciebunt !</l>
     <l n="4">Qui Juvenes ! quantas ostentant , aspice , vires .</l>
     <l n="5">Ne , pueri ! ne tanta animis assuescite bella .</l>
     <l n="6">Tuque prior , tu parce , genus qui ducis Olympo ,</l>
     <l n="7">Sidereo flagrans clypeo , et cœlestibus armis ,</l>
     <l n="8">Projice tela manu , sanguis meus !</l>
     <l n="9">Nec te ullæ facies , non terruit ipse Typhœus</l>
     <l n="10">Arduus , arma tenens ; non te Messapus et Ufens ,</l>
     <l n="11">Contemtorque Deûm Mezentius .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>VIRG .</p>
   <p>But to return . He that has this idea of perfection in the work he undertakes , however successful he is , will yet be modest ; because to rise up to that idea , which he proposed for his model , is almost , if not absolutely , impossible .</p>
   <p>These two observations account for what may seem as strange , as it is infallibly true ; I mean , they show us why good writers have the lowest , and bad writers the highest , opinion of their own performances . They who have only a partial idea of this perfection , as their portion of ignorance or knowledge of it is greater or less , have proportionable degrees of modesty or conceit .</p>
   <p>Nor , though natural good understanding makes a tolerably just judgment in things of this nature , will the reader judge the worse , for forming to himself a notion of what he ought to expect from the piece he has in hand , before he begins his perusal of it .</p>
   <p>The ode , as it is the eldest kind of poetry , so it is more spiritous , and more remote from prose , than any other , in sense , sound , expression , and conduct . Its thoughts should be uncommon , sublime , and moral ; its numbers full , easy , and most harmonious ; its expression pure , strong , delicate , yet unaffected ; and of a curious felicity beyond other poems ; its conduct should be rapturous , somewhat abrupt , and immethodical to a vulgar eye . That apparent order , and connexion , which gives form and life to some compositions , takes away the very soul of this . Fire , elevation , and select thought , are indispensable ; an humble , tame , and vulgar ode is the most pitiful error a pen can commit .</p>
   <p>Musa dedit fidibus divos , puerosque deorum .</p>
   <p>And as its subjects are sublime , its writer ’ s genius should be so too ; otherwise it becomes the meanest thing in writing , viz . an involuntary burlesque .</p>
   <p>It is the genuine character , and true merit of the ode , a little to startle some apprehensions . Men of cold complexions are very apt to mistake a want of vigour in their imaginations , for a delicacy of taste in their judgments ; and , like persons of a tender sight , they look on bright objects , in their natural lustre , as too glaring ; what is most delightful to a stronger eye , is painful to them . Thus Pindar , who has as much logic at the bottom as Aristotle or Euclid , to some critics has appeared as mad ; and must appear so to all who enjoy no portion of his own divine spirit . Dwarf understandings , measuring others by their own standard , are apt to think they see a monster , when they see a man .</p>
   <p>And indeed it seems to be the amends which nature makes to those whom she has not blessed with an elevation of mind , to indulge them in the comfortable mistake , that all is wrong , which falls not within the narrow limits of their own comprehensions and relish .</p>
   <p>Judgment , indeed , that masculine power of the mind , in ode , as in all compositions , should bear the supreme sway ; and a beautiful imagination , as its mistress , should be subdued to its dominion . Hence , and hence only , can proceed the fairest offspring of the human mind .</p>
   <p>But then in ode , there is this difference from other kinds of poetry ; that , there , the imagination , like a very beautiful mistress , is indulged in the appearance of domineering ; though the judgment , like an artful lover , in reality carries its point ; and the less it is suspected of it , it shows the more masterly conduct , and deserves the greater commendation .</p>
   <p>It holds true in this province of writing , as in war , “ The more danger ; the more honour . ” It must be very enterprising : it must , in Shakespeare ’ s style , have hairbreadth ’ scapes ; and often tread the very brink of error : nor can it ever deserve the applause of the real judge , unless it renders itself obnoxious to the misapprehensions of the contrary .</p>
   <p>Such is Casimire ’ s strain among the moderns , whose lively wit , and happy fire , is an honour to them . And Buchanan might justly be much admired , if any thing more than the sweetness of his numbers , and the purity of his diction , were his own : his original , from which I have taken my motto , through all the disadvantages of a northern prose translation , is still admirable ; and , Cowley says , as preferable in beauty to Buchanan , as Judæa is to Scotland .</p>
   <p>Pindar , Anacreon , Sappho , and Horace , are the great masters of lyric poetry among Heathen writers . Pindar ’ s muse , like Sacharissa , is a stately , imperious , and accomplished beauty ; equally disdaining the use of art , and the fear of any rival ; so intoxicating that it was the highest commendation that could be given an ancient , that he was not afraid to taste of her charms ;</p>
   <p>Pindarici fontis qui non expalluit haustus ;</p>
   <p>a danger which Horace declares he durst not run .</p>
   <p>Anacreon ’ s Muse is like Amoret , most sweet , natural , and delicate ; all over flowers , graces , and charms ; inspiring complacency , not awe ; and she seems to have good nature enough to admit a rival , which she cannot find .</p>
   <p>Sappho ’ s Muse , like Lady ——, is passionately tender , and glowing ; like oil set on fire , she is soft , and warm , in excess . Sappho has left us a few fragments only ; time has swallowed the rest ; but that little which remains , like the remaining jewel of Cleopatra , after the other was dissolved at her banquet , may be esteemed ( as was that jewel ) a sufficient ornament for the goddess of beauty herself .</p>
   <p>Horace ’ s Muse ( like one I shall not presume to name ) is correct , solid , and moral ; she joins all the sweetness and majesty , all the sense and the fire of the former , in the justest proportions and degrees ; superadding a felicity of dress entirely her own . She moreover is distinguishable by this particularity , that she abounds in hidden graces , and secret charms , which none but the discerning can discover ; nor are any capable of doing full justice , in their opinion to her excellencies , without giving the world , at the same time , an incontestable proof of refinement in their own understandings .</p>
   <p>But , after all , to the honour of our own country I must add , that I think Mr. Dryden ’ s Ode on St. Cecilia ’ s Day inferior to no composition of this kind . Its chief beauty consists in adapting the numbers most happily to the variety of the occasion . Those by which he has chosen to express majesty , ( viz . )</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">are chosen in the following ode , because the subject of it is great .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>For the more harmony likewise , I chose the frequent return of rhyme ; which laid me under great difficulties . But difficulties overcome give grace and pleasure . Nor can I account for the pleasure of rhyme in general ( of which the moderns are too fond ) but from this truth .</p>
   <p>But then the writer must take care that the difficulty is overcome . That is , he must make rhyme consistent with as perfect sense , and expression , as could be expected if he was free from that shackle . Otherwise , it gives neither grace to the work , nor pleasure to the reader , nor , consequently , reputation to the poet .</p>
   <p>To sum the whole : ode should be peculiar , but not strained ; moral , but not flat ; natural , but not obvious ; delicate , but not affected ; noble , but not ambitious ; full , but not obscure ; fiery , but not mad ; thick , but not loaded in its numbers , which should be most harmonious , without the least sacrifice of expression , or of sense . Above all , in this , as in every work of genius , somewhat of an original spirit should be , at least attempted ; otherwise the poet , whose character disclaims mediocrity , makes a secondary praise his ultimate ambition ; which has something of a contradiction in it . Originals only have true life , and differ as much from the best imitations , as men from the most animated pictures of them . Nor is what I say at all inconsistent with a due deference for the great standards of antiquity ; nay , that very deference is an argument for it , for doubtless their example is on my side in this matter . And we should rather imitate their example in the general motives , and fundamental methods of their working , than in their works themselves . This is a distinction , I think , not hitherto made , and a distinction of consequence . For the first may make us their equals ; the second must pronounce us their inferiors even in our utmost success . But the first of these prizes is not so readily taken by the moderns ; as valuables too massy for easy carriage are not so liable to the thief .</p>
   <p>The ancients had a particular regard to the choice of their subjects ; which were generally national and great . My subject is , in its own nature , noble ; most proper for an Englishman ; never more proper than on this occasion ; and ( what is strange ) hitherto unsung .</p>
   <p>If I stand not absolutely condemned by my own rules ; if I have hit the spirit of ode in general ; if I cannot think with Mr. Cowley , that “ Music alone , sometimes , makes an excellent ode ; ”</p>
   <p>Versus inopes rerum , nugæque canoræ ;</p>
   <p>if there is any thought , enthusiasm , and picture , which are as the body , soul , and robe of poetry ; in a word , if in any degree I have provided rather food for men , than air for wits ; I hope smaller faults will meet indulgence for the sake of the design , which is the glory of my country and my king .</p>
   <p>And indeed , this may be said , in general , that great subjects are above being nice ; that dignity and spirit ever suffer from scrupulous exactness ; And that the minuter cares effeminate a composition . Great masters of poetry , painting , and statuary , in their nobler works , have even affected the contrary : and justly ; for a truly masculine air partakes more of the negligent , than of the neat , both in writings , and in life —</p>

    <head>To close : if a piece of this nature wants an apology , I must own , that those who have strength of mind sufficient profitably to devote the whole of their time to the severer studies , I despair of imitating , I can only envy and admire . The mind is relieved and strengthened by variety ; and he that sometimes is sporting with his pen , is only taking the most effectual means of giving a general importance to it . This truth is clear from the knowledge of human nature , and of history ; from which I could cite very celebrated instances , did I not fear that , by citing them , I should condemn myself , who am so little qualified to follow their example in its full extent .</head>

   <p>Though I have not the honour of being known to your lordship , I presume to take a privilege which men of retirement are apt to think themselves in possession of , as being the only method they have of making their way to persons of your lordship ’ s high station without struggling through multitudes for access . I may possibly fail in my respect to your lordship , even while I endeavour to show it most ; but if I err , it is because I imagined I ought not to make my first approach to one of your lordship ’ s exalted character with less ceremony than that of a dedication . It is annexed to the condition of eminent merit , not to suffer more from the malice of its enemies , than from the importunity of its admirers ; and perhaps it would be unjust , that your lordship should hope to be exempted from the troubles , when you possess all the talents , of a patron .</p>
   <p>I have here a fair occasion to celebrate those sublime qualities , of which a whole nation is sensible , were it not inconsistent with the design of my present application . By the just discharge of your great employments , your lordship may well deserve the prayers of the distressed , the thanks of your country , and the approbation of your royal master : this indeed is a reason why every good Briton should applaud your lordship ; but it is equally a reason why none should disturb you in the execution of your important affairs by works of fancy and amusement . I was therefore induced to make this address to your lordship , by considering you rather in the amiable light of a person distinguished for a refined taste of the polite arts , and the candour that usually attends it , than in the dignity of your public character .</p>
   <p>The greatness and solemnity of the subjects treated of in the following work cannot fail in some measure to recommend it to a person who holds in the utmost veneration those sacred books from which it is taken ; and would at the same time justify to the world my choice of the great name prefixed to it , could I be assured that the undertaking had not suffered in my hands . Thus much I think myself obliged to say ; that if this little performance had not been very indulgently spoken of by some , whose judgment is universally allowed in writings of this nature , I had not dared to gratify my ambition in offering it to your lordship : I am sensible that I am endeavouring to excuse one vanity by another ; but I hope I shall meet with pardon for it , since it is visibly intended to show the great submission and respect with which I am , my lord , your lordship ’ s most obedient and most humble servant ,</p>

     <l n="389">His pastimes like a cauldron boil the flood ,</l>
     <l n="390">And blacken ocean with the rising mud ;</l>
     <l n="391">The billows feel him , as he works his way ;</l>
     <l n="392">His hoary footsteps shine along the sea ;</l>
     <l n="393">The foam high-wrought , with white divides the green ,</l>
     <l n="394">And distant sailors point where death has been .</l>
     <l n="395">His like earth bears not on her spacious face :</l>
     <l n="396">Alone in nature stands his dauntless race ,</l>
     <l n="397">For utter ignorance of fear renown ’ d ,</l>
     <l n="398">In wrath he rolls his baleful eye around :</l>
     <l n="399">Makes every swoln , disdainful heart , subside ,</l>
     <l n="400">And holds dominion o ’ er the sons of pride .</l>
     <l n="401">Then the Chaldæan eas ’ d his lab ’ ring breast ,</l>

     <l n="406">Beyond the deepest reach of mortal eye .</l>
     <l n="407">Oft have I heard of thine Almighty power ;</l>

     <l n="77">E ’ en politics advance divinity :</l>
     <l n="78">True masters there are better scholars here ,</l>
     <l n="79">Who travel history in quest of schemes</l>
     <l n="80">To govern nations , or perhaps oppress ,</l>
     <l n="81">May there start truths that other aims inspire ,</l>

     <l n="87">Nor is divinity ungrateful found .</l>
     <l n="88">As politics advance divinity ,</l>

     <l n="90">True politics , and crowns the statesman ’ s praise .</l>
     <l n="91">All wisdoms are but branches of the chief ,</l>
     <l n="92">And statesmen found but shoots of honest men .</l>
     <l n="93">Are this world ’ s witchcrafts pleaded in excuse</l>
     <l n="94">For deviations in our moral line ?</l>
     <l n="95">This , and the next world , view ’ d with such an eye</l>
     <l n="96">As suits a statesman , such as keeps in view</l>
     <l n="97">His own exalted science , both conspire</l>
     <l n="98">To recommend and fix us in the right .</l>
     <l n="99">If we reward the politics of Heaven ,</l>

     <l n="101">What ’ s the next world ? A supplement of this :</l>
     <l n="102">Without it , justice is defective here ;</l>
     <l n="103">Just as to states , defective as to men :</l>
     <l n="104">If so , what is this world ? As sure as right</l>
     <l n="105">Sits in Heaven ’ s throne , a prophet of the next .</l>
     <l n="106">Prize you the prophet ? then believe him too :</l>
     <l n="107">His prophecy more precious than his smile .</l>
     <l n="108">How comes it then to pass , with most on earth ,</l>
     <l n="109">That this should charm us , that should discompose ?</l>
     <l n="110">Long as the statesman finds this case his own ,</l>
     <l n="111">So long his politics are uncomplete ;</l>
     <l n="112">In danger he ; nor is the nation safe ,</l>
     <l n="113">But soon must rue his inauspicious power .</l>
     <l n="114">What hence results ? a truth that should resound</l>
     <l n="115">For ever awful in Britannia ’ s ear :</l>
     <l n="116">“ Religion crowns the statesman and the man ,</l>
     <l n="117">Sole source of public and of private peace . ”</l>
     <l n="118">This truth all men must own , and therefore will ,</l>
     <l n="119">And praise and preach it too :— and when that ’ s done ,</l>
     <l n="120">Their compliment is paid , and ’ tis forgot .</l>
     <l n="121">What highland pole-axe half so deep can wound ?</l>
     <l n="122">But how dare I , so mean , presume so far ?</l>
     <l n="123">Assume my seat in the dictator ’ s chair ?</l>
     <l n="124">Pronounce , predict ( as if indeed inspir ’ d ) ,</l>
     <l n="125">Promulge my censures , lay out all my throat ,</l>
     <l n="126">Till hoarse in clamour on enormous crimes ?</l>
     <l n="127">Two mighty columns rise in my support ;</l>
     <l n="128">In their more awful and authentic voice ,</l>
     <l n="129">Record profane and sacred , drown the muse ,</l>
     <l n="130">Tho ’ loud , and far out-thread her threatening song .</l>
     <l n="131">Still further , Holles ! suffer me to plead</l>
     <l n="132">That I speak freely , as I speak to thee :</l>
     <l n="133">Guilt only startles at the name of guilt ;</l>
     <l n="134">And truth , plain truth , is welcome to the wise .</l>
     <l n="135">Thus what seem ’ d my presumption is thy praise .</l>
     <l n="136">Praise , and immortal praise , is virtue ’ s claim ;</l>
     <l n="137">And virtue ’ s sphere is action : yet we grant</l>
     <l n="138">Some merit to the trumpet ’ s loud alarm ,</l>
     <l n="139">Whose clangour kindles cowards into men .</l>
     <l n="140">Nor shall the verse , perhaps , be quite forgot ,</l>
     <l n="141">Which talks of immortality , and bids ,</l>
     <l n="142">In every British breast , true glory rise ,</l>
     <l n="143">As now the warbling lark awakes the morn .</l>
     <l n="144">To close , my lord ! with that which all should close</l>
     <l n="145">And all begin , and strike us every hour ,</l>
     <l n="146">Though no war wak ’ d us , no black tempest frown ’ d .</l>
     <l n="147">The morning rises gay ; yet gayest morn</l>
     <l n="148">Less glorious after night ’ s incumbent shades ;</l>
     <l n="149">Less glorious far bright nature , rich array ’ d</l>
     <l n="150">With golden robes , in all the pomp of noon ,</l>
     <l n="151">Than the first feeble dawn of moral day ?</l>
     <l n="152">Sole day , ( let those whom statesmen serve attend ,)</l>
     <l n="153">Though the sun ripens diamonds for their crowns ;</l>
     <l n="154">Sole day worth his regard whom Heaven ordains ,</l>

   <p>This was not intended for the public ; there were many and strong reasons against it , and are so still ; but some extracts of it , from the few copies which were given away , being got into the printed papers , it was thought necessary to publish something , lest a copy still more imperfect than this should fall into the press : and it is hoped , that this unwelcome occasion of publication may be some excuse for it .</p>
   <p>As for the following stanzas , God Almighty ’ s infinite power , and marvellous goodness to man , is dwelt on , as the most just and cogent reason for our cheerful and absolute resignation to his will ; nor are any of those topics declined , which have a just tendency to promote that supreme virtue : such as the vanity of this life , the value of the next , the approach of death , &amp; c .</p>

   <note>Postscript . Thus have I written , when to write No mortal should presume ; Or only write , what none can blame , Hic jacet — for his tomb : The public frowns , and censures loud My puerile employ ; Though just the censure , if you smile , The scandal I enjoy ; But sing no more — no more I sing Or reassume the lyre , Unless vouchsaf ’ d an humble part Where Raphael leads the choir : What myriads swell the concert loud ! Their golden harps resound High as the footstool of the throne , And deep as hell profound : Hell ( horrid contrast ! ) chord and song Of raptur ’ d angels drowns In self-will ’ s peal of blasphemies , And hideous burst of groans ; But drowns them not to me ; I hear Harmonious thunders roll ( In language low of men to speak ) From echoing pole to pole ! Whilst this grand chorus shakes the skies — “ Above , beneath the sun , Through boundless age , by men , by gods , Jehovah ’ s will be done ! ” ’ Tis done in heaven ; whence headlong hurl ’ d Self-will with Satan fell ; And must from earth be banish ’ d too , Or earth ’ s another hell ; Madam ! self-will inflicts your pains : Self-will ’ s the deadly foe Which deepens all the dismal shades , And points the shafts of woe : Your debt to nature fully paid , Now virtue claims her due : But virtue ’ s cause I need not plead , ’ Tis safe ; I write to you : You know , that virtue ’ s basis lies In ever judging right ; And wiping error ’ s clouds away , Which dim the mental sight : Why mourn the dead ? you wrong the grave , From storm that safe resort ; We still are tossing out at sea , Our admiral in port . Was death denied , this world , a scene How dismal and forlorn ! To death we owe , that ’ tis to man A blessing to be born ; When every other blessing fails , Or sapp ’ d by slow decay , Or , storm ’ d by sudden blasts of fate , Is swiftly whirl ’ d away ; How happy ! that no storm , or time , Of death can rob the just ! None pluck from their unaching heads Soft pillows in the dust ! Well pleas ’ d to bear heaven ’ s darkest frown , Your utmost power employ ; ’ Tis noble chemistry to turn Necessity to joy . Whate ’ er the colour of my fate , My fate shall be my choice : Determin ’ d am I , whilst I breathe , To praise and to rejoice ; What ample cause ! triumphant hope ! O rich eternity ! I start not at a world in flames , Charm ’ d with one glimpse of thee : And thou ! its great inhabitant ! How glorious dost thou shine ! And dart through sorrow , danger , death , A beam of joy divine ! The void of joy ( with some concern The truth severe I tell ) Is an impenitent in guilt , A fool or infidel ! Weigh this , ye pupils of Voltaire ! From joyless murmur free ; Or , let us know , which character Shall crown you of the three . Resign , resign : this lesson none Too deeply can instill ; A crown has been resign ’ d by more , Than have resign ’ d the will ; Though will resign ’ d the meanest makes Superior in renown , And richer in celestial eyes , Than he who wears a crown ; Hence , in the bosom cold of age , It kindled a strange aim To shine in song ; and bid me boast The grandeur of my theme : But oh ! how far presumption falls Its lofty theme below ! Our thoughts in life ’ s December freeze , And numbers cease to flow . First ! greatest ! best ! grant what I wrote For others , ne ’ er may rise To brand the writer ! thou alone Canst make our wisdom wise ; And how unwise ! how deep in guilt ! How infamous the fault ! “ A teacher thron ’ d in pomp of words , Indeed , beneath the taught ! ” Means most infallible to make The world an infidel ; And , with instructions most divine , To pave a path to hell ; O ! for a clean and ardent heart , O ! for a soul on fire , Thy praise , begun on earth , to sound Where angels string the lyre ; How cold is man ! to him how hard ( Hard , what most easy seems ) “ To set a just esteem on that , Which yet he — most esteems ! ” What shall we say , when boundless bliss Is offer ’ d to mankind , And to that offer when a race Of rationals is blind ? Of human nature ne ’ er too high Are our ideas wrought ; Of human merit ne ’ er too low Depress ’ d the daring thought . ON THE LATE QUEEN ’ S DEATH , AND HIS MAJESTY ’ S ACCESSION TO THE THRONE</note>
   <div type="dedication">
    <p>Inscribed to Joseph Addison , Esq . Secretary to Their Excellencies the Lords Justices . Gaudia curis . — HOR . Sir , I have long , and with impatience , sought To ease the fulness of my grateful thought , My fame at once , and duty to pursue , And please the public , by respect to you . Though you , long since beyond Britannia known , Have spread your country ’ s glory with your own ; To me you never did more lovely shine , Than when so late the kindled wrath divine Quench ’ d our ambition , in great Anna ’ s fate , And darken ’ d all the pomp of human state . Though you are rich in fame , and fame decay , Though rais ’ d in life , and greatness fade away , Your lustre brightens : virtue cuts the gloom With purer rays , and sparkles near a tomb . Know , sir , the great esteem and honour due , I chose that moment to profess to you , When sadness reign ’ d , when fortune , so severe , Had warm ’ d our bosoms to be most sincere . And when no motives could have force to raise A serious value , and provoke my praise , But such as rise above , and far transcend , Whatever glories with this world shall end , Then shining forth , when deepest shades shall blot The sun ’ s bright orb , and Cato be forgot . I sing — but ah ! my theme I need not tell , See every eye with conscious sorrow swell : Who now to verse would raise his humble voice , Can only show his duty , not his choice . How great the weight of grief our hearts sustain ! We languish , and to speak is to complain . Let us look back , ( for who too oft can view That most illustrious scene , for ever new ! ) See all the seasons shine on Anna ’ s throne , And pay a constant tribute , not their own . Her summer ’ s heats nor fruits alone bestow , They reap the harvest , and subdue the foe ; And when black storms confess the distant sun , Her winters wear the wreaths her summers won . Revolving pleasures in their turns appear , And triumphs are the product of the year . To crown the whole , great joys in greater cease , And glorious victory is lost in peace . Whence this profusion on our favour ’ d isle ? Did partial fortune on our virtue smile ? Or did the sceptre , in great Anna ’ s hand , Stretch forth this rich indulgence o ’ er our land ? Ungrateful Britain ! quit thy groundless claim , Thy queen and thy good fortune are the same . Hear , with alarms our trumpets fill the sky ; ’ Tis Anna reigns ! the Gallic squadrons fly . We spread our canvass to the southern shore ; ’ Tis Anna reigns ! the south resigns her store . Her virtue smooths the tumult of the main , And swells the field with mountains of the slain Argyll and Churchill but the glory share , While millions lie subdu ’ d by Anna ’ s prayer . How great her zeal ! how fervent her desire ! How did her soul in holy warmth expire ! Constant devotion did her time divide , Not set returns of pleasure or of pride . Not want of rest , or the sun ’ s parting ray , But finish ’ d duty , limited the day . How sweet succeeding sleep ! what lovely themes Smil ’ d in her thoughts , and soften ’ d all her dreams ! Her royal couch descending angels spread , And join ’ d their wings a shelter o ’ er her head . Though Europe ’ s wealth and glory claim ’ d a part , Religion ’ s cause reign ’ d mistress of her heart : She saw , and griev ’ d to see , the mean estate Of those who round the hallow ’ d altar wait ; She shed her bounty , piously profuse , And thought it more her own in sacred use . Thus on his furrow see the tiller stand , And fill with genial seed his lavish hand ; He trusts the kindness of the fruitful plain , And providently scatters all his grain . What strikes my sight ? does proud Augusta rise New to behold , and awfully surprise ! Her lofty brow more numerous turrets crown , And sacred domes on palaces look down : A noble pride of piety is shown , And temples cast a lustre on the throne . How would this work another ’ s glory raise ! But Anna ’ s greatness robs her of the praise . Drown ’ d in a brighter blaze it disappears , Who dried the widow ’ s and the orphan ’ s tears ? Who stoop ’ d from high to succour the distrest And reconcile the wounded heart to rest ? Great in her goodness , well could we perceive , Whoever sought , it was a queen that gave . Misfortune lost her name , her guiltless frown But made another debtor to the crown ; And each unfriendly stroke from fate we bore , Became our title to the regal store . Thus injur ’ d trees adopt a foreign shoot , And their wounds blossom with a fairer fruit . Ye numbers , who on your misfortunes thriv ’ d , When first the dreadful blast of fame arriv ’ d , Say what a shock , what agonies you felt , How did your souls with tender anguish melt ! That grief which living Anna ’ s love suppress ’ d , Shook like a tempest every grateful breast , A second fate our sinking fortunes tried ! A second time our tender parents died ! Heroes returning from the field we crown , And deify the haughty victor ’ s frown . His splendid wealth too rashly we admire , Catch the disease , and burn with equal fire : Wisely to spend , is the great art of gain ; And one reliev ’ d transcends a million slain . When time shall ask , where once Ramillia lay , Or Danube flow ’ d that swept whole troops away , One drop of water , that refresh ’ d the dry , Shall rise a fountain of eternal joy . But ah ! to that unknown and distant date Is virtue ’ s great reward push ’ d off by fate ; Here random shafts in every breast are found , Virtue and merit but provoke the wound . August in native worth and regal state , Anna sate arbitress of Europe ’ s fate ; To distant realms did every accent fly , And nations watch ’ d each motion of her eye . Silent , nor longer awful to be seen , How small a spot contains the mighty queen ! No throng of suppliant princes mark the place , Where Britain ’ s greatness is compos ’ d in peace : The broken earth is scarce discern ’ d to rise , And a stone tells us where the monarch lies . Thus end maturest honours of the crown ! This is the last conclusion of renown ! So when with idle skill the wanton boy Breathes through his tube ; he sees , with eager joy , The trembling bubble , in its rising small ; And by degrees expands the glittering ball . But when , to full perfection blown , it flies High in the air , and shines in various dyes , The little monarch , with a falling tear , Sees his world burst at once , and disappear , ’ Tis not in sorrow to reverse our doom , No groans unlock th ’ inexorable tomb ! Why then this fond indulgence of our woe ! What fruit can rise , or what advantage flow ! Yes , this advantage ; from our deep distress We learn how much in George the gods can bless Had a less glorious princess left the throne , But half the hero had at first been shown : An Anna falling all the king employs , To vindicate from guilt our rising joys : Our joys arise and innocently shine , Auspicious monarch ! what a praise is thine ! Welcome , great stranger , to Britannia ’ s throne ! Nor let thy country think thee all her own . Of thy delay how oft did we complain ! Our hopes reach ’ d out , and met thee on the main . With prayer we smooth the billows for thy fleet ; With ardent wishes fill thy swelling sheet ; And when thy foot took place on Albion ’ s shore , We bending bless ’ d the gods , and ask ’ d no more . What hand but thine should conquer and compose , Join those whom interest joins , and chase our foes ? Repel the daring youth ’ s presumptuous aim , And by his rival ’ s greatness give him fame ? Now in some foreign court he may sit down , And quit without a blush the British crown . Secure his honour , though he lose his store , And take a lucky moment to be poor . Nor think , great sir , now first , at this late hour , In Britain ’ s favour , you exert your power ; To us , far back in time , I joy to trace The numerous tokens of your princely grace . Whether you chose to thunder on the Rhine , Inspire grave councils , or in courts to shine ; In the more scenes your genius was display ’ d , The greater debt was on Britannia laid : They all conspir ’ d this mighty man to raise , And your new subjects proudly share the praise . All share ; but may not we have leave to boast That we contemplate , and enjoy it most ? This ancient nurse of arts , indulged by fate On gentle Isis ’ bank , a calm retreat ; For many roiling ages justly fam ’ d , Has through the world her loyalty proclaim ’ d ; And often pour ’ d ( too well the truth is known ! ) Her blood and treasure to support the throne ! For England ’ s church her latest accents strain ’ d ; And freedom with his dying hand retain ’ d . No wonder then her various ranks agree In all the fervencies of zeal for thee . What though thy birth a distant kingdom boast , And seas divide thee from the British coast ? The crown ’ s impatient to enclose thy head : Why stay thy feet ? the cloth of gold is spread . Our strict obedience through the world shall tell That king ’ s a Briton , who can govern well ! THE INSTALMENT . To the Right Hon . Sir Robert Walpole , Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Garter . Quæsitam meritis . — HOR . With invocations some their breasts inflame ; I need no muse , a Walpole is my theme . Ye mighty dead , ye garter ’ d sons of praise ! Our morning stars ! our boast in former days ! Which hovering o ’ er , your purple wings display , Lur ’ d by the pomp of this distinguish ’ d day , Stoop , and attend : by one , the knee be bound ; One , throw the mantle ’ s crimson folds around ; By that , the sword on his proud thigh be plac ’ d ; This , clasp the diamond girdle round his waist ; His breast , with rays , let just Godolphin spread ; Wise Burleigh plant the plumage on his head ; And Edward own , since first he fix ’ d the race , None press ’ d fair glory with a swifter pace . When fate would call some mighty genius forth To wake a drooping age to godlike worth , Or aid some favourite king ’ s illustrious toil , It bids his blood with generous ardour boil ; His blood , from virtue ’ s celebrated source , Pour ’ d down the steep of time , a lengthen ’ d course ; That men prepar ’ d may just attention pay , Warn ’ d by the dawn to mark the glorious day , When all the scatter ’ d merits of his line Collected to a point , intensely shine . See , Britain , see thy Walpole shine from far , His azure ribbon , and his radiant star ; A star that , with auspicious beams , shall guide Thy vessel safe , through fortune ’ s roughest tide . If peace still smiles , by this shall commerce steer A finish ’ d course , in triumph round the sphere ; And , gathering tribute from each distant shore , In Britain ’ s lap the world ’ s abundance pour . If war ’ s ordain ’ d , this star shall dart its beams Through that black cloud which , rising from the Thames , With thunder , form ’ d of Brunswick ’ s wrath , is sent To claim the seas , and awe the continent . This shall direct it where the bolt to throw , A star for us , a comet to the foe . At this the muse shall kindle , and aspire : My breast , O Walpole , glows with grateful fire . The streams of royal bounty , turn ’ d by thee , Refresh the dry domains of poesy . My fortune shows , when arts are Walpole ’ s care , What slender worth forbids us to despair : Be this thy partial smile from censure free ; ’ Twas meant for merit , though it fell on me . Since Brunswick ’ s smile has authoris ’ d my muse , Chaste be her conduct , and sublime her views . False praises are the whoredoms of the pen , Which prostitute fair fame to worthless men : This profanation of celestial fire Makes fools despise , what wise men should admire . Let those I praise to distant times be known , Not by their author ’ s merit , but their own . If others think the task is hard , to weed From verse rank flattery ’ s vivacious seed , And rooted deep ; one means must set them free , Patron ! and patriot ! let them sing of thee . While vulgar trees ignobler honours wear , Nor those retain , when winter chills the year ; The generous orange , favourite of the sun , With vigorous charms can through the seasons run ; Defies the storm with her tenacious green ; And flowers and fruits in rival pomp are seen : Where blossoms fall , still fairer blossoms spring ; And midst their sweets the feather ’ d poets sing . On Walpole , thus , may pleas ’ d Britannia view At once her ornament and profit too ; The fruit of service , and the bloom of fame , Matur ’ d and gilded by the royal beam . He , when the nipping blasts of envy rise Its guilt can pity , and its rage despise ; Lets fall no honours , but , securely great , Unfaded holds the colour of his fate : No winter knows , though ruffling factions press ; By wisdom deeply rooted in success ; One glory shed , a brighter is display ’ d ; ( 61 ) And the charm ’ d muses shelter in his shade . O how I long , enkindled by the theme , In deep eternity to launch thy name ! Thy name in view , no rights of verse I plead , But what chaste truth indites , old time shall read . “ Behold ! a man of ancient faith and blood , Which , soon , beat high for arts , and public good ; Whose glory great , but natural appears , The genuine growth of services and years ; No sudden exhalation drawn on high , And fondly gilt by partial majesty : One bearing greatest toils with greatest ease , One born to serve us , and yet born to please : Whom , while our rights in equal scales he lays , The prince may trust , and yet the people praise ; His genius ardent , yet his judgment clear , His tongue is flowing , and his heart sincere , His counsel guides , his temper cheers our isle , And , smiling , gives three kingdoms cause to smile . ” Joy then to Britain , blest with such a son , To Walpole joy , by whom the prize is won ; Who nobly conscious meets the smiles of fate ; True greatness lies in daring to be great . Let dastard souls , or affectation , run To shades , nor wear bright honours fairly won ; Such men prefer , misled by false applause , The pride of modesty to virtue ’ s cause . Honours , which make the face of virtue fair , ’ Tis great to merit , and ’ tis wise to wear ; ’ Tis holding up the prize to public view , Confirms grown virtue , and inflames the new ; Heightens the lustre of our age and clime , And sheds rich seeds of worth for future time . Proud chiefs alone , in fields of slaughter fam ’ d , Of old , this azure bloom of glory claim ’ d , As when stern Ajax pour ’ d a purple flood , The violet rose , fair daughter of his blood . Now rival wisdom dares the wreath divide , And both Minervas rise in equal pride ; Proclaiming loud , a monarch fills the throne , Who shines illustrious not in wars alone . Let fame look lovely in Britannia ’ s eyes ; They coldly court desert , who fame despise . For what ’ s ambition , but fair virtue ’ s sail ? And what applause , but her propitious gale ? When swell ’ d with that , she fleets before the wind To glorious aims , as to the port design ’ d ; When chain ’ d , without it , to the labouring oar , She toils ! she pants ! nor gains the flying shore , From her sublime pursuits , or turn ’ d aside By blasts of envy , or by fortune ’ s tide : For one that has succeeded ten are lost , Of equal talents , ere they make the coast . Then let renown to worth divine incite , With all her beams , but throw those beams aright . Then merit droops , and genius downward tends , When godlike glory , like our land , descends . Custom the garter long confin ’ d to few , And gave to birth , exalted virtue ’ s due : Walpole has thrown the proud enclosure down ; And high desert embraces fair renown . Though rival ’ d , let the peerage smiling see ( Smiling , in justice to their own degree ) This proud reward by majesty bestow ’ d On worth like that whence first the peerage flow ’ d . From frowns of fate Britannia ’ s bliss ’ d to guard , Let subjects merit , and let kings reward . Gods are most gods by giving to excel , And kings most like them , by rewarding well . Though strong the twanging nerve , and drawn aright , Short is the winged arrow ’ s upward flight ; But if an eagle it transfix on high , Lodg ’ d in the wound , it soars into the sky . Thus while I sing thee with unequal lays , And wound perhaps that worth I mean to praise ; Yet I transcend myself , I rise in fame , Not lifted by my genius , but my theme . No more : for in this dread suspense of fate , Now kingdoms fluctuate , and in dark debate Weigh peace and war , now Europe ’ s eyes are bent On mighty Brunswick , for the great event , Brunswick of kings the terror or defence ! Who dares detain thee at a world ’ s expense ? AND EPISTLE TO THE RIGHT HON . GEORGE LORD LANSDOWNE . 1712 . Parnassia laurus Parva sub ingenti matris se subjicit umbra . — VIRG . When Rome , my lord , in her full glory shone , And great Augustus rul ’ d the globe alone , While suppliant kings in all their pomp and state Swarm ’ d in his courts , and throng ’ d his palace gate ; Horace did oft the mighty man detain , And sooth ’ d his breast with no ignoble strain ; Now soar ’ d aloft , now struck an humbler string ; And taught the Roman genius how to sing . Pardon , if I his freedom dare pursue , Who know no want of Cæsar , finding you ; The muse ’ s friend is pleas ’ d the muse should press Through circling crowds , and labor for access , That partial to his darling he may prove , And shining throngs for her reproach remove , To all the world industrious to proclaim His love of arts , and boast the glorious flame . Long has the western world reclin ’ d her head , Pour ’ d forth her sorrow , and bewail ’ d her dead ; Fell discord through her borders fiercely rang ’ d , And shook her nations , and her monarchs chang ’ d ; By land and sea , its utmost rage employ ’ d ; Nor heaven repair ’ d so fast as men destroy ’ d . In vain kind summers plentuous fields bestow ’ d , In vain the vintage liberally flow ’ d ; Alarms from loaden boards all pleasures chas ’ d , And robb ’ d the rich Burgundian grape of taste ; The smiles of Nature could no blessing bring , The fruitful autumn , or the flowery spring ; Time was distinguish ’ d by the sword and spear , Not by the various aspects of the year ; The trumpet ’ s sound proclaim ’ d a milder sky , And bloodshed told us when the sun was nigh . But now ( so soon is Britain ’ s blessing seen , When such as you are near her glorious queen ! ) Now peace , though long repuls ’ d , arrives at last , And bids us smile on all our labours past ; Bids every nation cease her wonted moan , And every monarch call his crown his own : To valour gentler virtues now succeed ; No longer is the great man born to bleed ; Renown ’ d in councils , brave Argyle shall tell , Wisdom and prowess in one breast may dwell : Through milder tracts he soars to deathless fame , And without trembling we resound his name . No more the rising harvest whets the sword , No longer waves uncertain of its lord ; Who cast the seed , the golden sheaf shall claim , Nor chance of battle change the master ’ s name . Each stream unstain ’ d with blood more smoothly flows ; The brighter sun a fuller day bestows ; All nature seems to wear a cheerful face , And thank great Anna for returning peace . The patient thus , when on his bed of pain , No longer he invokes the gods in vain , But rises to new life ; in every field He finds Elysium , rivers nectar yield ; Nothing so cheap and vulgar but can please , And borrow beauties from his late disease . Nor is it peace alone , but such a peace , As more than bids the rage of battle cease . Death may determine war , and rest succeed , ’ Cause nought survives on which our rage may feed : In faithful friends we lose our glorious foes , And strifes of love exalt our sweet repose . See graceful Bolingbroke , your friend , advance , Nor miss his Lansdowne in the court of France ; So well receiv ’ d , so welcome , so at home , ( Blest change of fate ,) in Bourbon ’ s stately dome ; The monarch pleas ’ d , descending from his throne , Will not that Anna call him all her own ; He claims a part , and looking round to find Something might speak the fulness of his mind , A diamond shines , which oft had touch ’ d him near , Renew ’ d his grief , and robb ’ d him of a tear ; Now first with joy beheld , well plac ’ d on one , Who makes him less regret his darling son ; So dear is Anna ’ s minister , so great , Your glorious friend in his own private state . To make our nations longer two , in vain Does nature interpose the raging main : The Gallic shore to distant Britain grows , For Lewis Thames , the Seine for Anna flows : From conflicts pass ’ d each other ’ s worth we find , And thence in stricter friendship now are join ’ d ; Each wound receiv ’ d , now pleads the cause of love , And former injuries endearments prove . What Briton but must prize th ’ illustrious sword , That cause of fear to Churchill could afford ? Who sworn to Bourbon ’ s sceptre , but must frame Vast thoughts of him , that could brave Tallard tame ? Thus generous hatred in affection ends , And war , which rais ’ d the foes , completes the friends . A thousand happy consequences flow ( The dazzling prospect makes my bosom glow ) ; Commerce shall lift her swelling sails , and roll Her wealthy fleets secure from pole to pole ; The British merchant , who with care and pain For many moons sees only skies and main ; When now in view of his loved native shore , The perils of the dreadful ocean o ’ er , Cause to regret his wealth no more shall find , Nor curse the mercy of the sea and wind ; By hardest fate condemn ’ d to serve a foe , And give him strength to strike a deeper blow . Sweet Philomela providently flies To distant woods and streams , for such supplies , To feed her young , and make them try the wing , And with their tender notes attempt to sing : Meanwhile , the fowler spreads his secret snare , And renders vain the tuneful mother ’ s care . Britannia ’ s bold adventurer of late The foaming ocean plow ’ d with equal fate . Goodness is greatness in its utmost height , And power a curse , if not a friend to right : To conquer is to make dissension cease , That man may serve the King of kings in peace . Religion now shall all her rays dispense , And shine abroad in perfect excellence ; Else we may dread some greater curse at hand , To scourge a thoughtless and ungrateful land : Now war is weary , and retir ’ d to rest ; The meagre famine , and the spotted pest , Deputed in her stead , may blast the day , And sweep the relics of the sword away . When peaceful Numa fill ’ d the Roman throne , Jove in the fulness of his glory shone ; Wise Solomon , a stranger to the sword , Was born to raise a temple to the Lord . Anne too shall build , and every sacred pile Speak peace eternal to Britannia ’ s isle . Those mighty souls , whom military care Diverted from their only great affair , Shall bend their full united force , to bless Th ’ Almighty Author of their late success . And what is all the world subdued to this ? The grave sets bounds to sublunary bliss ; But there are conquests to great Anna known , Above the splendour of an earthly throne ; Conquests ! whose triumph is too great , within The scanty bounds of matter to begin ; Too glorious to shine forth , till it has run Beyond this darkness of the stars and sun , And shall whole ages past be still , still but begun . Heroic shades ! whom war has swept away , Look down , and smile on this auspicious day : Now boast your deaths ; to those your glory tell , Who or at Agincourt or Cressy fell ; Then deep into eternity retire , Of greater things than peace or war inquire ; Fully content , and unconcern ’ d , to know What farther passes in the world below . The bravest of mankind shall now have leave To die but once , nor piece-meal seek the grave : On gain or pleasure bent , we shall not meet Sad melancholy numbers in each street ( Owners of bones dispers ’ d on Flandria ’ s plain , Or wasting in the bottom of the main ) ; To turn us back from joy , in tender fear , Lest it an insult of their woes appear , And make us grudge ourselves that wealth , their blood Perhaps preserv ’ d , who starve , or beg for food . Devotion shall run pure , and disengage From that strange fate of mixing peace with rage . On heaven without a sin we now may call , And guiltless to our Maker prostrate fall ; Be Christians while we pray , nor in one breath Ask mercy for ourselves , for others death . But O ! I view with transport arts restor ’ d , Which double use to Britain shall afford ; Secure her glory purchas ’ d in the field , And yet for future peace sweet motives yield : While we contemplate on the painted wall , The pressing Briton , and the flying Gaul , In such bright images , such living grace , As leave great Raphael but the second place ; Our cheeks shall glow , our heaving bosoms rise , And martial ardours sparkle in our eyes ; Much we shall triumph in our battles past , And yet consent those battles prove our last ; Lest , while in arms for brighter fame we strive , We lose the means to keep that fame alive . In silent groves the birds delight to sing , Or near the margin of a secret spring : Now all is calm , sweet music shall improve , Nor kindle rage , but be the nurse of love . But what ’ s the warbling voice , the trembling string , Or breathing canvass , when the muses sing ? The muse , my lord , your care above the rest , With rising joy dilates my partial breast ; The thunder of the battle ceas ’ d to roar , Ere Greece her godlike poets taught to soar ; Rome ’ s dreadful foe , great Hannibal , was dead , And all her warlike neighbours round her bled ; For Janus shut , her Iö Pæans rung , Before an Ovid or a Virgil sung . A thousand various forms the muse may wear , ( A thousand various forms become the fair ;) But shines in none with more majestic mien , Than when in state she draws the purple scene ; Calls forth her monarchs , bids her heroes rage , And mourning beauty melt the crowded stage ; Charms back past ages , gives to Britain ’ s use The noblest virtues time did e ’ er produce ; Leaves fam ’ d historians ’ boasted art behind ; They keep the soul alone , and that ’ s confin ’ d , Sought out with pains , and but by proxy speaks The hero ’ s presence deep impression makes ; The scenes his soul and body reunite , Furnish a voice , produce him to the sight ; Make our contemporary him that stood High in renown , perhaps before the flood ; Make Nestor to this age advice afford , And Hector for our service draw his sword . More glory to an author what can bring , Whence nobler service to his country spring , Than from those labours , which , in man ’ s despight , Possess him with a passion for the right ? With honest magic make the knave inclin ’ d To pay devotion to the virtuous mind ; Through all her toils and dangers bid him rove , And with her wants and anguish fall in love ? Who hears the godlike Montezuma groan , And does not wish the glorious pain his own ? Lend but your understanding , and their skill Can domineer at pleasure o ’ er your will : Nor is the short-liv ’ d conquest quickly past ; Shame , if not choice , will hold the convert fast . How often have I seen the generous bowl With pleasing force unlock a secret soul , And steal a truth , which every sober hour ( The prose of life ) had kept within her power ! The grape victorious often has prevail ’ d , When gold and beauty , racks and tortures , fail ’ d : Yet when the spirit ’ s tumult was allay ’ d , She mourn ’ d , perhaps , the sentiment betray ’ d ; But mourn ’ d too late , no longer could deny , And on her own confession charge the lie . Thus they , whom neither the prevailing love Of goodness here , or mercy from above , Or fear of future pains , or human laws Could render advocates in virtue ’ s cause , Caught by the scene , have unawares resign ’ d Their wonted disposition of the mind : By slow degrees prevails the pleasing tale , As circling glasses on our senses steal ; Till thoroughly by the muses ’ banquet warm ’ d , The passions tossing , all the soul alarm ’ d , They turn mere zealots flush ’ d with glorious rage , Rise in their seats , and scarce forbear the stage , Assistance to wrong ’ d innocence to bring , Or turn the poniard on some tyrant king . How can they cool to villains ? how subside To dregs of vice , from such a godlike pride ? To spoiling orphans how to day return , Who wept last night to see Monimia mourn ? In this gay school of virtue , whom so fit To govern , and control the world of wit , As Talbot , Lansdowne ’ s friend , has Britain known ? Him polish ’ d Italy has call ’ d her own ; He in the lap of elegance was bred , And trac ’ d the muses to their fountain head : But much we hope , he will enjoy at home What ’ s nearer ancient than the modern Rome . Nor fear I mention of the court of France , When I the British genius would advance ; There too has Shrewsbury improv ’ d his taste ; Yet still we dare invite him to our feast : For Corneille ’ s sake I shall my thoughts suppress Of Oroonoko , and presume him less : What though we wrong him ? Isabella ’ s woe Waters those bays that shall for ever grow . Our foes confess , nor we the praise refuse , The drama glories in the British muse . The French are delicate , and nicely lead Of close intrigue the labyrinthian thread ; Our genius more affects the grand , than fine , Our strength can make the great plain action shine : They raise a great curiosity indeed , From his dark maze to see the hero freed ; We rouse th ’ affections , and that hero show Gasping beneath some formidable blow : They sigh ; we weep : the Gallic doubt and care We heighten into terror and despair ; Strike home , the strongest passions boldly touch , Nor fear our audience should be pleas ’ d too much . What ’ s great in nature we can greatly draw , Nor thank for beauties the dramatic law . The fate of Cæsar is a tale too plain The fickle Gallic taste to entertain ; Their art would have perplex ’ d , and interwove The golden arras with gay flowers of love : We know heaven made him a far greater man Than any Cæsar , in a human plan , And such we draw him , nor are too refin ’ d , To stand affected with what heaven design ’ d . To claim attention , and the heart invade , Shakespeare but wrote the play th ’ Almighty made . Our neighbour ’ s stage-art too bare-fac ’ d betrays , ’ Tis great Corneille at every scene we praise ; On nature ’ s surer aid Britannia calls , None think of Shakespeare till the curtain falls ; Then with a sigh returns our audience home , From Venice , Egypt , Persia , Greece , or Rome . France yields not to the glory of our lines , But manly conduct of our strong designs ; That oft they think more justly we must own , Not ancient Greece a truer sense has shown : Greece thought but justly , they think justly too ; We sometimes err by striving more to do . So well are Racine ’ s meanest persons taught , But change a sentiment , you make a fault ; Nor dare we charge them with the want of flame : When we boast more , we own ourselves to blame . And yet in Shakespeare something still I find , That makes me less esteem all human kind ; He made one nature , and another found , Both in his page with master strokes abound : His witches , fairies , and enchanted isle . Bid us no longer at our nurses smile ; Of lost historians we almost complain , Nor think it the creation of his brain . Who lives , when his Othello ’ s in a trance ? With his great Talbot ( 62 ) too he conquer ’ d France . Long we may hope brave Talbot ’ s blood will run In great descendants , Shakespeare has but one ; And him , my lord , permit me not to name , But in kind silence spare his rival ’ s shame :— Yet I in vain that author would suppress , What can ’ t be greater , cannot be made less : Each reader will defeat my fruitless aim , And to himself great Agamemnon name . Should Shakespeare rise unbless ’ d with Talbot ’ s smile , E ’ en Shakespeare ’ s self would curse this barren isle : But if that reigning star propitious shine , And kindly mix his gentle rays with thine ; E ’ en I , by far the meanest of your age , Shall not repent my passion for the stage . Thus did the will almighty disallow , No human force could pluck the golden bough , Which left the tree with ease at Jove ’ s command , And spar ’ d the labour of the weakest hand . Auspicious fate ! that gives me leave to write To you , the muses ’ glory and delight ; Who know to read , nor false encomiums raise , And mortify an author with your praise : Praise wounds a noble mind , when ’ tis not due , But censure ’ s self will please , my lord , from you ; Faults are our pride and gain , when you descend To point them out , and teach us how to mend . What though the great man set his coffers wide , That cannot gratify the poet ’ s pride ; Whose inspiration , if ’ tis truly good , Is best rewarded , when best understood . The muses write for glory , not for gold , ’ Tis far beneath their nature to be sold : The greatest gain is scorn ’ d , but as it serves To speak a sense of what the muse deserves ; The muse which from her Lansdowne fears no wrong , Best judge , as well as subject , of her song . Should this great theme allure me further still , And I presume to use your patience ill , The world would plead my cause , and none but you Will take disgust at what I now pursue : Since what is mean my muse can ’ t raise , I ’ ll choose A theme that ’ s able to exalt my muse . For who , not void of thought , can Granville name , Without a spark of his immortal flame ? Whether we seek the patriot , or the friend , Let Bolingbroke , let Anna recommend ; Whether we choose to love or to admire , You melt the tender , and th ’ ambitious fire . Such native graces without thought abound , And such familiar glories spread around , As more incline the stander by to raise His value for himself , than you to praise . Thus you befriend the most heroic way , Bless all , on none an obligation lay ; So turn ’ d by nature ’ s hand for all that ’ s well , ’ Tis scarce a virtue when you most excel . Tho ’ sweet your presence , graceful is your mien , You to be happy want not to be seen ; Though priz ’ d in public , you can smile alone , Nor court an approbation but your own : In throngs , not conscious of those eyes that gaze In wonder fix ’ d , though resolute to please ; You , were all blind , would still deserve applause ; The world ’ s your glory ’ s witness , not its cause ; That lies beyond the limits of the day , Angels behold it , and their God obey . You take delight in others ’ excellence ; A gift , which nature rarely does dispense : Of all that breathe ’ tis you , perhaps , alone Would be well pleas ’ d to see yourself outdone . You wish not those , who show your name respect , So little worth , as might excuse neglect ; Nor are in pain lest merit you should know ; Nor shun the well deserver as a foe ; A troublesome acquaintance , that will claim To be well us ’ d , or dye your cheek with shame . You wish your country ’ s good ; that told so well Your powers are known , th ’ event I need not tell . When Nestor spoke , none ask ’ d if he prevail ’ d ; That god of sweet persuasion never fail ’ d : And such great fame had Hector ’ s valour wrought , Who meant he conquer ’ d , only said he fought . When you , my lord , to sylvan scenes retreat , No crowds around for pleasure , or for state , You are not cast upon a stranger land , And wander pensive o ’ er the barren strand ; Nor are you by receiv ’ d example taught , In toys to shun the discipline of thought ; But unconfin ’ d by bounds of time and place , You choose companions from all human race ; Converse with those the deluge swept away , Or those whose midnight is Britannia ’ s day . Books not so much inform , as give consent To those ideas your own thoughts present ; Your only gain from turning volumes o ’ er , Is finding cause to like yourself the more : In Grecian sages you are only taught With more respect to value your own thought : Great Tully grew immortal , while he drew Those precepts we behold alive in you : Your life is so adjusted to their schools , It makes that history they meant for rules . What joy , what pleasing transport , must arise Within your breast , and lift you to the skies , When , in each learned page that you unfold , You find some part of your own conduct told ! So pleas ’ d , and so surpris ’ d , Æneas stood , And such triumphant raptures fir ’ d his blood , When far from Trojan shores the hero spied His story shining forth in all its pride ; Admir ’ d himself , and saw his actions stand The praise and wonder of a foreign land . He knows not half his being , who ’ s confin ’ d In converse , and reflection on mankind : Your soul , which understands her charter well , Disdains imprison ’ d by those skies to dwell ; Ranges eternity without the leave Of death , nor waits the passage of the grave . When pains eternal , and eternal bliss , When these high cares your weary thoughts dismiss , In heavenly numbers you your soul unbend , And for your ease to deathless fame descend . Ye kings ! would ye true greatness understand , Read Seneca grown rich in Granville ’ s hand . ( 63 ) Behold the glories of your life complete ! Still at a flow , and permanently great ; New moments shed new pleasures as they fly , And yet your greatest is , that you must die . Thus Anna saw , and rais ’ d you to the seat Of honour , and confess ’ d her servant great ; Confess ’ d , not made him such ; for faithful fame Her trumpet swell ’ d long since with Granville ’ s name ; Though you in modesty the title wear , Your name shall be the title of your heir ; Farther than ermine , make his glory known , And cast in shades the favour of a throne . From thrones the beam of high distinction springs ; The soul ’ s endowments from the King of kings , Lo ! one great day calls forth ten mighty peers ! Produce ten Granvilles in five thousand years ; Anna , be thou content to fix the fate Of various kingdoms , and control the great ; But O ! to bid thy Granville brighter shine ! To him that great prerogative resign , Who the sun ’ s height can raise at pleasure higher , His lamp illumine , set his flames on fire . Yet still one bliss , one glory , I forbear , A darling friend whom near your heart you wear ; That lovely youth , my lord , whom you must blame , That I grow thus familiar with your name . He ’ s friendly , open , in his conduct nice , Nor serve these virtues to atone for vice : Vice has he none , or such as none wish less , But friends indeed , good-nature in excess . You cannot boast the merit of a choice , In making him your own , ’ twas nature ’ s voice , Which call ’ d too loud by man to be withstood , Pleading a tie far nearer than of blood ; Similitude of manners , such a mind As makes you less the wonder of mankind . Such ease his common converse recommends , As he ne ’ er felt a passion , but his friend ’ s ; Yet fix ’ d his principles , beyond the force Of all beneath the sun , to bend his course . ( 64 ) Thus the tall cedar , beautiful and fair , Flatters the motions of the wanton air ; Salutes each passing breeze with head reclin ’ d : The pliant branches dance in every wind : But fix ’ d the stem her upright state maintains , And all the fury of the north disdains . How are you bless ’ d in such a matchless friend ! Alas ! with me the joys of friendship end ; O Harrison ! I must , I will complain ; Tears soothe the soul ’ s distress , tho ’ shed in vain ; Didst thou return , and bless thy native shore With welcome peace , and is my friend no more ?— Thy task was early done , and I must own Death kind to thee , but ah ! to thee alone . But ’ tis in me a vanity to mourn , The sorrows of the great thy tomb adorn ; Strafford and Bolingbroke the loss perceive , They grieve , and make thee envied in thy grave . With aching heart , and a foreboding mind , I night to day in painful journey join ’ d , When first inform ’ d of his approaching fate ; But reach ’ d the partner of my soul too late : ’ Twas past , his cheek was cold ; that tuneful tongue , Which Isis charm ’ d with its melodious song , Now languish ’ d , wanted strength to speak his pain , Scarce rais ’ d a feeble groan , and sunk again : Each art of life , in which he bore a part , Shot like an arrow through my bleeding heart . To what serv ’ d all his promis ’ d wealth and power , But more to load that most unhappy hour ? Yet still prevail ’ d the greatness of his mind ; That , not in health , or life itself confin ’ d , Felt through his mortal pangs Britannia ’ s peace , Mounted to joy , and smil ’ d in death ’ s embrace . His spirit now just ready to resign , No longer now his own , no longer mine , He grasps my hand , his swimming eyeballs roll , My hand he grasps , and enters in my soul : Then with a groan — Support me , O ! beware Of holding worth , however great , too dear ! ( 65 ) Pardon , my lord , the privilege of grief , That in untimely freedom seeks relief ; To better fate your love I recommend , O ! may you never lose so dear a friend ! May nothing interrupt your happy hours ; Enjoy the blessings peace on Europe showers : Nor yet disdain those blessings to adorn ; To make the muse immortal , you was born . Sing ; and in latest time , when story ’ s dark , This period your surviving fame shall mark ; Save from the gulf of years this glorious age , And thus illustrate their historian ’ s page . The crown of Spain in doubtful balance hung , And Anna Britain sway ’ d , when Granville sung : That noted year Europa sheath ’ d her sword , When this great man was first saluted lord . TWO EPISTLES TO MR. POPE Concerning the Authors of the Age . 1730 . Epistle I. Whilst you at Twickenham plan the future wood , Or turn the volumes of the wise and good , Our senate meets ; at parties , parties bawl , And pamphlets stun the streets , and load the stall ; So rushing tides bring things obscene to light , Foul wrecks emerge , and dead dogs swim in sight ; The civil torrent foams , the tumult reigns , And Codrus ’ prose works up , and Lico ’ s strains . Lo ! what from cellars rise , what rush from high , Where speculation roosted near the sky ; Letters , essays , sock , buskin , satire , song , And all the garret thunders on the throng ! O Pope ! I burst ; nor can , nor will , refrain ; I ’ ll write ; let others , in their turn , complain : Truce , truce , ye Vandals ! my tormented ear Less dreads a pillory than a pamphleteer ; I ’ ve heard myself to death ; and , plagu ’ d each hour , Shan ’ t I return the vengeance in my power ? For who can write the true absurd like me ?—— Thy pardon , Codrus ! who , I mean , but thee ? Pope ! if like mine , or Codrus ’, were thy style , The blood of vipers had not stain ’ d thy file ; Merit less solid , less despite had bred ; They had not bit , and then they had not bled . Fame is a public mistress , none enjoys , But , more or less , his rival ’ s peace destroys ; With fame , in just proportion , envy grows ; The man that makes a character , makes foes : Slight , peevish insects round a genius rise , As a bright day awakes the world of flies ; With hearty malice , but with feeble wing , ( To show they live ) they flutter , and they sting : But as by depredations wasps proclaim The fairest fruit , so these the fairest fame . Shall we not censure all the motley train , Whether with ale irriguous , or champaign ? Whether they tread the vale of prose , or climb , And whet their appetites on cliffs of rhyme ; The college sloven , or embroider ’ d spark ; The purple prelate , or the parish clerk ; The quiet quidnunc , or demanding prig ; The plaintiff tory , or defendant whig ; Rich , poor , male , female , young , old , gay , or sad ; Whether extremely witty , or quite mad ; Profoundly dull , or shallowly polite ; Men that read well , or men that only write ; Whether peers , porters , tailors , tune the reeds , And measuring words to measuring shapes succeeds ; For bankrupts write , when ruin ’ d shops are shut , As maggots crawl from out a perish ’ d nut . His hammer this , and that his trowel quits , And , wanting sense for tradesmen , serve for wits . By thriving men subsists each other trade ; Of every broken craft a writer ’ s made : Thus his material , paper , takes its birth From tatter ’ d rags of all the stuff on earth . Hail , fruitful isle ! to thee alone belong Millions of wits , and brokers in old song : Thee well a land of liberty we name , Where all are free to scandal and to shame ; Thy sons , by print , may set their hearts at ease , And be mankind ’ s contempt , whene ’ er they please ; Like trodden filth , their vile and abject sense Is unperceiv ’ d , but when it gives offence : Their heavy prose our injur ’ d reason tires ; Their verse immoral kindles loose desires : Our age they puzzle , and corrupt our prime , Our sport and pity , punishment and crime . What glorious motives urge our authors on , Thus to undo , and thus to be undone ? One loses his estate , and down he sits , To show ( in vain ! ) he still retains his wits : Another marries , and his dear proves keen ; He writes as an hypnotic for the spleen : Some write , confin ’ d by physic ; some , by debt ; Some , for ’ tis Sunday ; some , because ’ tis wet ; Through private pique some do the public right , And love their king and country out of spite : Another writes because his father writ , And proves himself a bastard by his wit . Has Lico learning , humour , thought profound ? Neither : why write then ? He wants twenty pound : His belly , not his brains , this impulse give ; He ’ ll grow immortal ; for he cannot live : He rubs his awful front , and takes his ream , With no provision made , but of his theme ; Perhaps a title has his fancy smit , Or a quaint motto , which he thinks has wit : He writes , in inspiration puts his trust , Tho ’ wrong his thoughts , the gods will make them just ; Genius directly from the gods descends , And who by labour would distrust his friends ? Thus having reason ’ d with consummate skill , In immortality he dips his quill : And , since blank paper is denied the press , He mingles the whole alphabet by guess : In various sets , which various words compose , Of which , he hopes , mankind the meaning knows . So sounds spontaneous from the sibyl broke , Dark to herself the wonders which she spoke ; The priests found out the meaning , if they could ; And nations star ’ d at what none understood . Clodio dress ’ d , danc ’ d , drank , visited , ( the whole And great concern of an immortal soul ! ) Oft have I said , “ Awake ! exist ! and strive For birth ! nor think to loiter is to live ! ” As oft I overheard the demon say , Who daily met the loit ’ rer in his way , “ I ’ ll meet thee , youth , at White ’ s : ” the youth replies , “ I ’ ll meet thee there , ” and falls his sacrifice ; His fortune squander ’ d , leaves his virtue bare To ev ’ ry bribe , and blind to ev ’ ry snare : Clodio for bread his indolence must quit , Or turn a soldier , or commence a wit . Such heroes have we ! all , but life , they stake ; How must Spain tremble , and the German shake ! Such writers have we ! all , but sense , they print ; Ev ’ n George ’ s praise is dated from the mint . In arms contemptible , in arts profane , Such swords , such pens , disgrace a monarch ’ s reign . Reform your lives before you thus aspire , And steal ( for you can steal ) celestial fire . O the just contrast ! O the beauteous strife ! ’ Twixt their cool writings , and pindaric life : They write with phlegm , but then they live with fire ; They cheat the lender , and their works the buyer . I reverence misfortune , not deride ; I pity poverty , but laugh at pride : For who so sad , but must some mirth confess At gay Castruchio ’ s miscellaneous dress ? Though there ’ s but one of the dull works he wrote , There ’ s ten editions of his old lac ’ d coat . These , nature ’ s commoners , who want a home , Claim the wide world for their majestic dome ; They make a private study of the street ; And , looking full on every man they meet , Run souse against his chaps ; who stands amaz ’ d To find they did not see , but only gaz ’ d . How must these bards be rapt into the skies ! you need not read , you feel their ecstasies . Will they persist ? ’ Tis Madness ; Lintot , run , See them confin ’ d —" O that ’ s already done . ” Most , as by leases , by the works they print , Have took , for life , possession of the mint . If you mistake , and pity these poor men , est Ulubris , they cry , and write again . Such wits their nuisance manfully expose , And then pronounce just judges learning ’ s foes ; O frail conclusion ; the reverse is true ; If foes to learning , they ’ d be friends to you : Treat them , ye judges ! with an honest scorn , And weed the cockle from the generous corn : There ’ s true good nature in your disrepect ; In justice to the good , the bad neglect : For immortality , if hardships plead , It is not theirs who write , but ours who read . But , O ! what wisdom can convince a fool , But that ’ tis dulness to conceive him dull ? ’ Tis sad experience takes the censor ’ s part , Conviction , not from reason , but from smart . a virgin author , recent from the press , The sheets yet wet , applauds his great success ; Surveys them , reads them , takes their charms to bed , Those in his hand , and glory in his head ; ’ Tis joy too great ; a fever of delight ! His heart beats thick , nor close his eyes all night : But rising the next morn to clasp his fame , He finds that without sleeping he could dream : So sparks , they say , take goddesses to bed , And find next day the devil in their stead . In vain advertisements the town o ’ erspread ; They ’ re epitaphs , and the work is dead . Who press for fame , but small recruits will raise ; ’ Tis volunteers alone can give the bays . A famous author visits a great man , Of his immortal work displays the plan , And says , “ Sir , I ’ m your friend ; all fears dismiss ; Your glory , and my own , shall live by this ; Your power is fixt , your fame thro ’ time convey ’ d , And Britain Europe ’ s queen — if I am paid . ” A statesman has his answer in a trice : “ Sir , such a genius is beyond all price ; What man can pay for this ? "— Away he turns ; His work is folded , and his bosom burns : His patron he will patronize no more ; But rushes like a tempest out of door . Lost is the patriot , and extinct his name ! Out comes the piece , another , and the same ; For A , his magic pen evokes an O , And turns the tide of Europe on the foe : He rams his quill with scandal , and with scoff ; But ’ tis so very foul , it wont go off : Dreadful his thunders , while unprinted , roar ; But when once publish ’ d , they are heard no more . Thus distant bugbears fright , but , nearer draw , The block ’ s a block , and turns to mirth your awe . Can those oblige , whose heads and hearts are such ? No ; every party ’ s tainted by their touch . Infected persons fly each public place ; And none , or enemies alone , embrace : To the foul fiend their every passion ’ s sold : They love , and hate , extempore , for gold : What image of their fury can we form ? Dulness and rage , a puddle in a storm . Rest they in peace ? If you are pleas ’ d to buy , To swell your sails , like Lapland winds , they fly : Write they with rage ? The tempest quickly flags ; A state Ulysses tames ’ em with his bags ; Let him be what he will , Turk , Pagan , Jew : For Christian ministers of state are few . Behind the curtain lurks the fountain head , That pours his politics through pipes of lead , Which far and near ejaculate , and spout O ’ er tea and coffee , poison to the rout : But when they have bespatter ’ d all they may , The statesman throws his filthy squirts away ! With golden forceps , these , another takes , And state elixirs of the vipers makes . The richest statesman wants wherewith to pay A servile sycophant , if well they weigh How much it costs the wretch to be so base ; Nor can the greatest powers enough disgrace , Enough chastise , such prostitute applause , If well they weigh how much it stains their cause . But are our writers ever in the wrong ? Does virtue ne ’ er seduce the venal tongue ? Yes ; if well brib ’ d , for virtue ’ s self they fight ; Still in the wrong , tho ’ champions for the right : Whoe ’ er their crimes for interest only quit , Sin on in virtue , and good deeds commit . Nought but inconstancy Britannia meets , And broken faith in their abandon ’ d sheets ; From the same hand how various is the page ! What civil war their brother pamphlets wage ! Tracts battle tracts , self-contradictions glare ; Say , is this lunacy ?— I wish it were . If such our writers , startled at the sight , Felons may bless their stars they cannot write ! How justly Proteus ’ transmigrations fit The monstrous changes of a modern wit ! Now , such a gentle stream of eloquence As seldom rises to the verge of sense ; Now , by mad rage , transform ’ d into a flame , Which yet fit engines , well applied , can tame ; Now , on immodest trash , the swine obscene , Invites the town to sup at Drury Lane ; A dreadful lion , now he roars at power , Which sends him to his brothers at the Tower ; He ’ s now a serpent , and his double tongue Salutes , nay licks , the feet of those he stung ; What knot can bind him , his evasion such ? One knot he well deserves , which might do much . The flood , flame , swine , the lion , and the snake , Those fivefold monsters , modern authors make : The snake reigns most ; snakes , Pliny says , are bred When the brain ’ s perish ’ d in a human head . Ye grov ’ ling , trodden , whipt , stript , turncoat things , Made up of venom , volumes , stains , and stings ! Thrown from the tree of knowledge , like you , curst To scribble in the dust , was snake the first . What if the figure should in fact prove true ! It did in Elkenah , why not in you ? Poor Elkenah , all other changes past , For bread in Smithfield dragons hist at last , Spit streams of fire to make the butchers gape , And found his manners suited to his shape : Such is the fate of talents misapplied ; So liv ’ d your prototype ; and so he died . Th ’ abandon ’ d manners of our writing train May tempt mankind to think religion vain ; But in their fate , their habit , and their mien , That gods there are is eminently seen : Heaven stands absolv ’ d by vengeance on their pen , And marks the murderers of fame from men : Through meagre jaws they draw their venal breath , As ghastly as their brothers in Macbeth : Their feet through faithless leather meet the dirt , And oftener chang ’ d their principles than shirt . The transient vestments of these frugal men , Hastens to paper for our mirth again : Too soon ( O merry melancholy fate ! ) They beg in rhyme , and warble through a grate : The man lampoon ’ d forgets it at the sight ; The friend through pity gives , the foe through spite ; And though full conscious of his injur ’ d purse , Lintot relents , nor Curll can wish them worse . So fare the men , who writers dare commence Without their patent , probity , and sense . From these , their politics our quidnuncs seek , And Saturday ’ s the learning of the week : These labouring wits , like paviours , mend our ways , With heavy , huge , repeated , flat essays ; Ram their coarse nonsense down , though ne ’ er so dull ; And hem at every thump upon your skull : These staunch bred writing hounds begin the cry , And honest folly echoes to the lie . O how I laugh , when I a blockhead see , Thanking a villain for his probity ; Who stretches out a most respectful ear , With snares for woodcocks in his holy leer : It tickles thro ’ my soul to hear the cock ’ s Sincere encomium on his friend the fox , Sole patron of his liberties and rights ! While graceless Reynard listens — till he bites . As when the trumpet sounds , th ’ o ’ erloaded state Discharges all her poor and profligate ; Crimes of all kinds dishonour ’ d weapons wield , And prisons pour their filth into the field ; Thus nature ’ s refuse , and the dregs of men , Compose the black militia of the pen . Epistle II . From Oxford . All write at London ; shall the rage abate Here , where it most should shine , the muses ’ seat ? Where , mortal or immortal , as they please , The learn ’ d may choose eternity , or ease ? Has not a ( 66 ) royal patron wisely strove To woo the muse in her Athenian grove ? Added new strings to her harmonious shell , And given new tongues to those who spoke so well ? Let these instruct , with truth ’ s illustrious ray , Awake the world , and scare our owls away . Meanwhile , O friend ! indulge me , if I give Some needful precepts how to write , and live ! Serious should be an author ’ s final views ; Who write for pure amusement , ne ’ er amuse . An author ! ’ tis a venerable name ! How few deserve it , and what numbers claim ! Unblest with sense above their peers refin ’ d , Who shall stand up , dictators to mankind ? Nay , who dare shine , if not in virtue ’ s cause ? That sole proprietor of just applause . Ye restless men , who pant for letter ’ d praise , With whom would you consult to gain the bays ?— With those great authors whose fam ’ d works you read ? ’ Tis well : go , then , consult the laurell ’ d shade . What answer will the laurell ’ d shade return ? Hear it , and tremble ! he commands you burn The noblest works his envied genius writ , That boast of nought more excellent than wit . If this be true , as ’ tis a truth most dread , Woe to the page which has not that to plead ! Fontaine and Chaucer , dying , wish ’ d unwrote , The sprightliest efforts of their wanton thought : Sidney and Waller , brightest sons of fame , Condemn the charm of ages to the flame : And in one point is all true wisdom cast , To think that early we must think at last . Immortal wits , ev ’ n dead , break nature ’ s laws , Injurious still to virtue ’ s sacred cause ; And their guilt growing , as their bodies rot , ( Revers ’ d ambition ! ) pant to be forgot . Thus ends your courted fame : does lucre then , The sacred thirst of gold , betray your pen ? In prose ’ tis blameable , in verse ’ tis worse , Provokes the muse , extorts Apollo ’ s curse : His sacred influence never should be sold : ’ Tis arrant simony to sing for gold : ’ Tis immortality should fire your mind ; Scorn a less paymaster than all mankind . If bribes you seek , know this , ye writing tribe ! Who writes for virtue has the largest bribe : All ’ s on the party of the virtuous man ; The good will surely serve him , if they can ; The bad , when interest , or ambition guide , And ’ tis at once their interest and their pride : But should both fail to take him to their care , He boasts a greater friend , and both may spare . Letters to man uncommon light dispense ; And what is virtue , but superior sense ? In parts and learning you who place your pride , Your faults are crimes , your crimes are double dyed . What is a scandal of the first renown , But letter ’ d knaves , and atheists in a gown ? ’ Tis harder far to please than give offence ; The least misconduct damns the brightest sense ; Each shallow pate , that cannot read your name , Can read your life , and will be proud to blame . Flagitious manners make impressions deep On those , that o ’ er a page of Milton sleep : Nor in their dulness think to save your shame , True , these are fools ; but wise men say the same . Wits are a despicable race of men , If they confine their talents to the pen ; When the man shocks us , while the writer shines , Our scorn in life , our envy in his lines . Yet , proud of parts , with prudence some dispense , And play the fool , because they ’ re men of sense . What instances bleed recent in each thought , Of men to ruin by their genius brought ! Against their wills what numbers ruin shun , Purely through want of wit to be undone ! Nature has shown , by making it so rare , That wit ’ s a jewel which we need not wear . Of plain sound sense life ’ s current coin is made ; With that we drive the most substantial trade . Prudence protects and guides us ; wit betrays ; A splendid source of ill ten thousand ways ; A certain snare to miseries immense ; A gay prerogative from common sense ; Unless strong judgment that wild thing can tame , And break to paths of virtue and of fame . But grant your judgment equal to the best , Sense fills your head , and genius fires your breast ; Yet still forbear : your wit ( consider well ) ’ Tis great to show , but greater to conceal ; As it is great to seize the golden prize Of place or power ; but greater to despise . If still you languish for an author ’ s name , Think private merit less than public fame , And fancy not to write is not to live ; Deserve , and take , the great prerogative . But ponder what it is ; how dear ’ twill cost , To write one page which you may justly boast . Sense may be good , yet not deserve the press ; Who write , an awful character profess ; The world as pupil of their wisdom claim , And for their stipend an immortal fame : Nothing but what is solid or refin ’ d , Should dare ask public audience of mankind . Severely weigh your learning , and your wit : Keep down your pride by what is nobly writ : No writer , fam ’ d in your own way , pass o ’ er ; Much trust example , but reflection more : More had the ancients writ , they more had taught ; Which shows some work is left for modern thought . This weigh ’ d , perfection know ; and known , adore ; Toil , burn for that ; but do not aim at more ; Above , beneath it , the just limits fix ; And zealously prefer four lines to six . Write , and re-write , blot out , and write again , And for its swiftness ne ’ er applaud your pen . Leave to the jockeys that Newmarket praise , Slow runs the Pegasus that wins the bays . Much time for immortality to pay , Is just and wise ; for less is thrown away . Time only can mature the labouring brain ; Time is the father , and the midwife pain : The same good sense that makes a man excel , Still makes him doubt he ne ’ er has written well . Downright impossibilities they seek ; What man can be immortal in a week ? Excuse no fault ; though beautiful , ’ twill harm ; One fault shocks more than twenty beauties charm . Our age demands correctness ; Addison And you this commendable hurt have done . Now writers find , as once Achilles found , The whole is mortal , if a part ’ s unsound . He that strikes out , and strikes not out the best , Pours lustre in , and dignifies the rest : Give e ’ er so little , if what ’ s right be there , We praise for what you burn , and what you spare : The part you burn , smells sweet before the shrine , And is as incense to the part divine . Nor frequent write , though you can do it well ; Men may too oft , though not too much , excel . A few good works gain fame ; more sink their price ; Mankind are fickle , and hate paying twice : They granted you writ well , what can they more , Unless you let them praise for giving o ’ er ? Do boldly what you do , and let your page Smile , if it smiles , and if it rages , rage . So faintly Lucius censures and commends , That Lucius has no foes , except his friends . Let satire less engage you than applause ; It shows a gen ’ rous mind to wink at flaws : Is genius yours ? be yours a glorious end , Be your king ’ s , country ’ s , truth ’ s , religion ’ s friend ; The public glory by your own beget ; Run nations , run posterity , in debt . And since the fam ’ d alone make others live , First have that glory you presume to give . If satire charms , strike faults , but spare the man ’ Tis dull to be as witty as you can . Satire recoils whenever charg ’ d too high ; Round your own fame the fatal splinters fly . As the soft plume gives swiftness to the dart , Good breeding sends the satire to the heart . Painters and surgeons may the structure scan ; Genius and morals be with you the man : Defaults in those alone should give offence ! Who strikes the person , pleads his innocence . My narrow minded satire can ’ t extend To Codrus ’ form ; I ’ m not so much his friend : Himself should publish that ( the world agree ) Before his works , or in the pillory . Let him be black , fair , tall , short , thin , or fat , Dirty or clean , I find no theme in that . Is that call ’ d humour ? It has this pretence , ’ Tis neither virtue , breeding , wit , or sense . Unless you boast the genius of a Swift , Beware of humour , the dull rogue ’ s last shift . Can others write like you ? Your task give o ’ er , ’ Tis printing what was publish ’ d long before . If nought peculiar through your labours run , They ’ re duplicates , and twenty are but one . Think frequently , think close , read nature , turn Men ’ s manners o ’ er , and half your volumes burn ; To nurse with quick reflection be your strife , Thoughts born from present objects , warm from life : When most unsought , such inspirations rise , Slighted by fools , and cherish ’ d by the wise : Expect peculiar fame from these alone ; These make an author , these are all your own . Life , like their Bibles , coolly men turn o ’ er ; Hence unexperienc ’ d children of threescore . True , all men think of course , as all men dream ; And if they slightly think , ’ tis much the same . Letters admit not of a half renown ; They give you nothing , or they give a crown . No work e ’ er gain ’ d true fame , or ever can , But what did honour to the name of man . Weighty the subject , cogent the discourse , Clear be the style , the very sound of force ; Easy the conduct , simple the design , Striking the moral , and the soul divine : Let nature art , and judgment wit , exceed ; O ’ er learning reason reign ; o ’ er that , your creed : Thus virtue ’ s seeds , at once , and laurel ’ s , grow ; Do thus , and rise a Pope , or a Despreau : And when your genius exquisitely shines , Live up to the full lustre of your lines : Parts but expose those men who virtue quit ; A fallen angel is a fallen wit ; And they plead Lucifer ’ s detested cause , Who for bare talents challenge our applause . Would you restore just honours to the pen ? From able writers rise to worthy men . “ Who ’ s this with nonsense , nonsense would restrain ? Who ’ s this ( they cry ) so vainly schools the vain ? Who damns our trash , with so much trash replete ? As , three ells round , huge Cheyne rails at meat ? ” Shall I with Bavius then my voice exalt , And challenge all mankind to find one fault ? With huge examens overwhelm my page , And darken reason with dogmatic rage ? As if , one tedious volume writ in rhyme , In prose a duller could excuse the crime : Sure , next to writing , the most idle thing Is gravely to harangue on what we sing . At that tribunal stands the writing tribe , Which nothing can intimidate or bribe : Time is the judge ; time has nor friend nor foe ; False fame must wither , and the true will grow . Arm ’ d with this truth , all critics I defy ; For if I fall , by my own pen I die ; While snarlers strive with proud but fruitless pain To wound immortals , or to slay the slain . Sore prest with danger , and in awful dread Of twenty pamphlets levell ’ d at my head , Thus have I forg ’ d a buckler in my brain , Of recent form , to serve me this campaign : And safely hope to quit the dreadful field Delug ’ d with ink , and sleep behind my shield ; Unless dire Codrus rouses to the fray In all his might , and damns me — for a day . As turns a flock of geese , and , on the green , Poke out their foolish necks in awkward spleen , ( Ridiculous in rage ! ) to hiss , not bite , So war their quills , when sons of dulness write . AN EPISTLE TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE SIR ROBERT WALPOLE . By Mr. Doddington , Afterwards Lord Melcombe . — Quæ censet amiculus , ut si Cæcus iter monstrare velit — HOR . Though strength of genius , by experience taught , Gives thee to sound the depths of human thought , To trace the various workings of the mind , And rule the secret springs , that rule mankind ; ( Rare gift ! ) yet , Walpole , wilt thou condescend To listen , if thy unexperienc ’ d friend Can aught of use impart , though void of skill , And win attention by sincere good-will ; For friendship , sometimes , want of parts supplies , The heart may furnish what the head denies . As when the rapid Rhone , o ’ er swelling tides , To grace old ocean ’ s court , in triumph rides , Tho ’ rich his source , he drains a thousand springs , Nor scorns the tribute each small rivulet brings . So thou shalt , hence , absorb each feeble ray , Each dawn of meaning , in thy brighter day ; Shalt like , or , where thou canst not like , excuse , Since no mean interest shall profane the muse , No malice , wrapt in truth ’ s disguise , offend , Nor flattery taint the freedom of the friend . When first a generous mind surveys the great , And views the crowds that on their fortune wait ; Pleas ’ d with the show ( though little understood ) He only seeks the power , to do the good ; Thinks , till he tries , ’ tis godlike to dispose , And gratitude still springs , where bounty sows ; That every grant sincere affection wins , And where our wants have end , our love begins : But those who long the paths of state have trod , Learn from the clamours of the murmuring crowd , Which cramm ’ d , yet craving still , their gates besiege , ’ Tis easier far to give , than to oblige . This of thy conduct seems the nicest part , The chief perfection of the statesman ’ s art , To give to fair assent a fairer face , Or soften a refusal into grace : But few there are that can be truly kind , Or know to fix their favours on the mind ; Hence , some , whene ’ er they would oblige , offend , And , while they make the fortune , lose the friend ; Still give , unthank ’ d ; still squander , not bestow ; For great men want not , what to give , but how . The race of men that follow courts , ’ tis true , Think all they get , and more than all , their due ; Still ask , but ne ’ er consult their own deserts , And measure by their interest , not their parts : From this mistake so many men we see But ill become the thing they wish ’ d to be ; Hence discontent , and fresh demands arise , More power , more favour in the great man ’ s eyes ; All feel a want , though none the cause suspects , But hate their patron , for their own defects ; Such none can please , but who reforms their hearts , And , when he gives them places , gives them parts . As these o ’ erprize their worth , so sure the great May sell their favour at too dear a rate ; When merit pines , while clamour is preferr ’ d , And long attachment waits among the herd ; When no distinction , where distinction ’ s due , Marks from the many the superior few ; When strong cabal constrains them to be just , And makes them give at last — because they must ; What hopes that men of real worth should prize , What neither friendship gives , nor merit buys ? The man who justly o ’ er the whole presides , His well-weigh ’ d choice with wise affection guides ; Knows when to stop with grace , and when advance , Nor gives through importunity or chance ; But thinks how little gratitude is ow ’ d , When favours are extorted , not bestow ’ d . When , safe on shore ourselves , we see the crowd Surround the great , importunate , and loud ; Through such a tumult , ’ tis no easy task To drive the man of real worth to ask : Surrounded thus , and giddy with the show , ’ Tis hard for great men rightly to bestow ; From hence so few are skill ’ d , in either case , To ask with dignity , or give with grace . Sometimes the great , seduc ’ d by love of parts , Consult our genius , and neglect our hearts ; Pleas ’ d with the glittering sparks that genius flings , They lift us , towering on their eagle ’ s wings , Mark out the flights by which themselves begun , And teach our dazzled eyes to bear the sun ; Till we forget the hand that made us great , And grow to envy , not to emulate : To emulate , a generous warmth implies , To reach the virtues , that make great men rise ; But envy wears a mean malignant face , And aims not at their virtues — but their place . Such to oblige , how vain is the pretence ! When every favour is a fresh offence , By which superior power is still implied , And , while it helps their fortune , hurts their pride . Slight is the hate , neglect or hardships breed ; But those who hate from envy , hate indeed . “ Since so perplex ’ d the choice , whom shall we trust ? ” Methinks I hear thee cry — The brave and just ; The man by no mean fears or hopes controll ’ d , Who serves thee from affection , not for gold . We love the honest , and esteem the brave , Despise the coxcomb , but detest the knave ; No show of parts the truly wise seduce , To think that knaves can be of real use . The man , who contradicts the public voice , And strives to dignify a worthless choice , Attempts a task that on that choice reflects , And lends us light to point out new defects . One worthless man , that gains what he pretends , Disgusts a thousand unpretending friends : And since no art can make a counterpass , Or add the weight of gold to mimic brass , When princes to bad ore their image join , They more debase the stamp , than raise the coin . Be thine the care , true merit to reward And gain the good — nor will that task be hard ; Souls form ’ d alike so quick by nature blend , An honest man is more than half thy friend . Him , no mean views , or haste to rise , shall sway , Thy choice to sully , or thy trust betray : Ambition , here , shall at due distance stand Nor is wit dangerous in an honest hand : Besides , if failings at the bottom lie , We view those failings with a lover ’ s eye ; Though small his genius , let him do his best , Our wishes and belief supply the rest . Let others barter servile faith for gold , His friendship is not to be bought or sold : Fierce opposition he , unmov ’ d , shall face , Modest in favour , daring in disgrace , To share thy adverse fate alone , pretend ; In power , a servant ; out of power , a friend . Here pour thy favours in an ample flood , Indulge thy boundless thirst of doing good : Nor think that good to him alone confin ’ d ; Such to oblige , is to oblige mankind . If thus thy mighty master ’ s steps thou trace , The brave to cherish , and the good to grace ; Long shalt thou stand from rage and faction free , And teach us long to love the king , through thee : Or fall a victim dangerous to the foe , And make him tremble when he strikes the blow ; While honour , gratitude , affection join To deck thy close , and brighten thy decline ; ( Illustrious doom ! ) the great , when this displac ’ d , With friendship guarded , and with virtue grac ’ d , In awful ruin , like Rome ’ s senate , fall , The prey and worship of the wondering Gaul . No doubt , to genius some reward is due , ( Excluding that , were satirizing you ;) But yet , believe thy undesigning friend , When truth and genius for thy choice contend , Tho ’ both have weight when in the balance cast , Let probity be first , and parts the last . On these foundations if thou dar ’ st be great , And check the growth of folly and deceit ; When party rage shall droop thro ’ length of days , And calumny be ripen ’ d into praise , Then future times shall to thy worth allow That fame , which envy would call flattery now . Thus far my zeal , though for the task unfit , Has pointed out the rocks where others split ; By that inspir ’ d , though stranger to the Nine , And negligent of any fame — but thine , I take the friendly , but superfluous part ; You act from nature what I teach from art . THE OLD MAN ’ S RELAPSE . Verses Occasioned by the Foregoing Epistle . Sopitos suscita ignes . — VIRG . From man ’ s too curious and impatient sight , The future , Heaven involves in thickest night . Credit gray hairs : though freedom much we boast , Some least perform , what they determine most . What sudden changes our resolves betray ! To-morrow is the satire on to-day , And shows its weakness . Whom shall men believe , When constantly themselves , themselves deceive ? Long had I bid my once-loved muse adieu ; You warm old age ; my passion burns anew . How sweet your verse ! how great your force of mind ! What power of words ! what skill in dark mankind ! Polite the conduct ; generous the design ; And beauty files , and strength sustains , each line . Thus Mars and Venus are , once more , beset ; Your wit has caught them in its golden net . But what strikes home with most exalted grace Is , haughty genius taught to know its place ; And , where worth shines , its humbled crest to bend , With zeal devoted to that godlike end . When we discern so rich a vein of sense , Through the smooth flow of purest eloquence ; ’ Tis like the limpid streams of Tagus roll ’ d O ’ er boundless wealth , o ’ er shining beds of gold . But whence so finish ’ d , so refin ’ d a piece ? The tongue denies it to old Rome and Greece ; The genius bids the moderns doubt their claim , And slowly take possession of the fame . But I nor know , nor care , by whom ’ twas writ , Enough for me that ’ tis from human wit ; That soothes my pride : all glory in the pen Which has done honour to the race of men . But this have others done ; a like applause An ancient and a modern Horace draws . ( 67 ) But they to glory by degrees arose , Meridian lustre you at once disclose . ’ Tis continence of mind , unknown before , To write so well , and yet to write no more . More bright renown can human nature claim , Than to deserve , and fly immortal fame ? Next to the godlike praise of writing well , Is on that praise with just delight to dwell . O , for some God my drooping soul to raise ! That I might imitate , as well as praise ; For all commend : e ’ en foes your fame confess ; Nor would Augustus ’ age have priz ’ d it less ; An age , which had not held its pride so long , But for the want of so complete a song . A golden period shall from you commence : Peace shall be sign ’ d ’ twixt wit and manly sense ; Whether your genius or your rank they view , The muses find their Halifax in you . Like him succeed ! nor think my zeal is shown For you ; ’ tis Britain ’ s interest , not your own ; For lofty stations are but golden snares , Which tempt the great to fall in love with cares . I would proceed , but age has chill ’ d my vein , ’ Twas a short fever , and I ’ m cool again . Though life I hate , methinks I could renew Its tasteless , painful course , to sing of you . When such the subject , who shall curb his flight ? When such your genius , who shall dare to write ? In pure respect , I give my rhyming o ’ er , And , to commend you most , commend no more . Adieu , whoe ’ er thou art ! on death ’ s pale coast Erelong I ’ ll talk thee o ’ er with Dryden ’ s ghost ; The bard will smile . A last , a long farewell ! Henceforth I hide me in my dusky cell ; There wait the friendly stroke that sets me free , And think of immortality and thee — My strains are number ’ d by the tuneful Nine ; Each maid presents her thanks , and all present thee mine . VERSES Sent by Lord Melcombe to Dr. Young , Not Long Before His Lordship ’ s Death . ( 68 ) Kind companion of my youth , Lov ’ d for genius , worth , and truth ! Take what friendship can impart , Tribute of a feeling heart ; Take the muse ’ s latest spark , ( 69 ) Ere we drop into the dark . He , who parts and virtue gave , Bad thee look beyond the grave Genius soars , and virtue guides ; Above , the love of God presides . There ’ s a gulf ’ twixt us and God ; Let the gloomy path be trod : Why stand shivering on the shore ? Why not boldly venture o ’ er ? Where unerring virtue guides , Let us have the winds and tides : Safe , through seas of doubts and fears , Rides the bark which virtue steers .

Virg . 23 A new fund for Greenwich hospital , recommended from the throne . 24 Written soon after King George the First ’ s accession . 25 It is disputed amongst the critics who was the author of the book of Job ; some give it to Moses , some to others . As I was engaged in this little performance , some arguments occurred to me which favour the former of those opinions ; which arguments I have flung into the following notes , where little else is to be expected . 26 The Almighty ’ s speech , chapter xxxviii . &amp; c. which is what I paraphrase in this little work , is by much the finest part of the noblest and most ancient poem in the world . Bishop Patrick says , its grandeur is as much above all other poetry , as thunder is louder than a whisper . In order to set this distinguished part of the poem in a fuller light , and give the reader a clearer conception of it , I have abridged the preceding and subsequent parts of the poem , and joined them to it ; so that this piece is a sort of an epitome of the whole book of Job . I use the word paraphrase , because I want another which might better answer to the uncommon liberties I have taken . I have omitted , added , and transposed . The mountain , the comet , the sun , and other parts , are entirely added : those upon the peacock , the lion , &amp; c. are much enlarged ; and I have thrown the whole into a method more suited to our notions of regularity . The judicious , if they compare this piece with the original , will , I flatter myself , find the reasons for the great liberties I have indulged myself in through the whole . Longinus has a chapter on interrogations , which shows that they contribute much to the sublime . This speech of the Almighty is made up of them . Interrogation seems indeed the proper style of majesty incensed . It differs from other manner of reproof , as bidding a person execute himself does from a common execution ; for he that asks the guilty a proper question , makes him , in effect , pass sentence on himself . 27 The book of Job is well known to be dramatic , and , like the tragedies of old Greece , is fiction built on truth . Probably this most noble part of it , the Almighty speaking out of the whirlwind , ( so suitable to the after-practice of the Greek stage , when there happened dignus vindice nodus ,) is fictitious ; but is a fiction more agreeable to the time in which Job lived , than to any since . Frequent before the law were the appearances of the Almighty after this manner , Exod . c. xix . Ezek . c. i . &amp; c. Hence is he said to “ dwell in thick darkness : and have his way in the whirlwind . ” 28 There is a very great air in all that precedes , but this is signally sublime . We are struck with admiration to see the vast and ungovernable ocean receiving commands , and punctually obeying them ; to find it like a managed horse , raging , tossing , and foaming , but by the rule and direction of its master . This passage yields in sublimity to that of “ Let there be light , ” &amp; c ., so much only as the absolute government of nature yields to the creation of it . 29 Another argument that Moses was the author , is , that most of the creatures here mentioned are Egyptian . The reason given why the raven is particularly mentioned as an object of the care of Providence , is , because by her clamorous and importunate voice , she particularly seems always calling upon it ; thence [ Greek : korassô , a korax ] , Ælian . l. ii . c. 48 , is “ to ask earnestly . ” And since there were ravens on the bank of the Nile more clamorous than the rest of that species , those probably are meant in that place . 30 There are many instances of this bird ’ s stupidity : let two suffice . First , it covers its head in the reeds , and thinks itself all out of sight , Stat lumine clauso Ridendum revoluta caput , creditque latere Quæ non ipsa videt . Claud . Secondly , they that go in pursuit of them , draw the skin of an ostrich ’ s neck on one hand , which proves a sufficient lure to take them with the other . They have so little brain , that Heliogabalus had six hundred heads for his supper . Here we may observe , that our judicious as well as sublime author , just touches the great points of distinction in each creature , and then hastens to another . A description is exact when you cannot add , but what is common to another thing ; nor withdraw , but something peculiarly belonging to the thing described . A likeness is lost in too much description , as a meaning often in too much illustration . 31 Here is marked another peculiar quality of this creature , which neither flies nor runs directly , but has a motion composed of both , and , using its wings as sails , makes great speed . Vasta velut Libyæ venantûm vocibus ales Cum premitur , calidas cursu transmittit arenas , Inque modum veli sinuatis flamine pennis Pulverulenta volat . Claud . in Eutr . 32 Xenophon says , Cyrus had horses that could overtake the goat and the wild ass ; but none that could reach this creature . A thousand golden ducats , or a hundred camels , was the stated price of a horse that could equal their speed . 33 Though this bird is but just mentioned in my author , I could not forbear going a little farther , and spreading those beautiful plumes ( which are there shut up ) in half a dozen lines . The circumstance I have marked of his opening his plumes to the sun is true . Expandit colores adverso maxime sole , quia sic fulgentius radiant . Plin . l. x. c. 20 . 34 Thyanus ( de Re Accip . ) mentions a hawk that flew from Paris to London in a night . And the Egyptians , in regard to its swiftness , made it their symbol for the wind ; for which reason we may suppose the hawk , as well as the crow above , to have been a bird of note in Egypt . 35 The eagle is said to be of so acute a sight , that when she is so high in air that man cannot see her , she can discern the smallest fish under water . My author accurately understood the nature of the creatures he describes , and seems to have been a naturalist as well as a poet , which the next note will confirm . 36 The meaning of this question is , Knowest thou the time and circumstances of their bringing forth ? For to know the time only was easy , and had nothing extraordinary in it ; but the circumstances had something peculiarly expressive of God ’ s providence , which makes the question proper in this place . Pliny observes , that the hind with young is by instinct directed to a certain herb called Seselis , which facilitates the birth . Thunder also ( which looks like the more immediate hand of Providence ) has the same effect . Ps . xxix . In so early an age to observe these things , may style our author a naturalist . 37 Pursuing their prey by night is true of most wild beasts , particularly the lion . Ps . cvi . 20 . The Arabians have one among their five hundred names for the lion , which signifies “ the hunter by moonshine . ” 38 Cephissi glaciale caput , quo suetus anhelam Ferre sitim Python , amnemque avertere ponto . Stat . Theb . vii . 349 . Qui spiris tegeret montes , hauriret hiatu Flumina , &amp; c. Claud . Pref . in Ruf . Let not then this hyperbole seem too much for an eastern poet , though some commentators of name strain hard in this place for a new construction , through fear of it . 39 The taking the crocodile is most difficult . Diodorus says , they are not to be taken but by iron nets . When Augustus conquered Egypt , he struck a medal , the impress of which was a crocodile chained to a palm-tree , with this inscription , Nemo antea religavit . 40 This alludes to a custom of this creature , which is , when sated with fish , to come ashore and sleep among the reeds . 41 The crocodile ’ s mouth is exceeding wide . When he gapes , says Pliny , sic totum os . Martial says to his old woman , Cum comparata rictibus tuis ora Niliacus habet crocodilus angusta . So that the expression there is barely just . 42 This too is nearer the truth than at first view may be imagined . The crocodile , say the naturalists , lying long under water , and being there forced to hold its breath , when it emerges , the breath long represt is hot , and bursts out so violently , that it resembles fire and smoke . The horse suppresses not his breath by any means so long , neither is he so fierce and animated ; yet the most correct of poets ventures to use the same metaphor concerning him : Collectumque premens volvit sub naribus ignem . By this and the foregoing note I would caution against a false opinion of the eastern boldness , from passages in them ill understood . 43 “ His eyes are like the eyelids of the morning . ” I think this gives us as great an image of the thing it would express as can enter the thought of man . It is not improbable that the Egyptians stole their hieroglyphic for the morning , which is the crocodile ’ s eye , from this passage , though no commentator , I have seen , mentions it . It is easy to conceive how the Egyptians should be both readers and admirers of the writings of Moses , whom I suppose the author of this poem . I have observed already that three or four of the creatures here described are Egyptian ; the two last are notoriously so , they are the river-horse and the crocodile , those celebrated inhabitants of the Nile ; and on these two it is that our author chiefly dwells . It would have been expected from an author more remote from that river than Moses , in a catalogue of creatures produced to magnify their Creator , to have dwelt on the two largest works of his hand , viz . the elephant and the whale . This is so natural an expectation , that some commentators have rendered behemoth and leviathan , the elephant and whale , though the descriptions in our author will not admit of it ; but Moses being , as we may well suppose , under an immediate terror of the hippopotamus and crocodile , from their daily mischiefs and ravages around him , it is very accountable why he should permit them to take place . 44 Though the report was propagated without the least truth , it may be sufficient ground to justify a poetical fancy ’ s enlarging on it . 45 Lord Aubrey Beauclerk was the eighth son of the Duke of St. Albans , who was one of the sons of King Charles the Second . He was born in the year 1711 ; and , being regularly bred to the sea service , in 1731 he was appointed to the command of his majesty ’ s ship the Ludlow Castle ; and he commanded the Prince Frederick at the attack of the harbour of Carthagena , March 24 , 1741 . This young nobleman was one of the most promising commanders in the king ’ s service . When on the desperate attack of the castle of Bocca Chica , at the entrance of the said harbour , he lost his life , both his legs being first shot off . The prose part of the inscription on his monument was the production of Mrs. Mary Jones of Oxford ; who also wrote a poem on his death , printed in her Miscellanies , 8vo , 1752 .— R . 46 Lord Sommers procured a pension for Mr. Addison , which enabled him to prosecute his travels .— R . 47 The publication of his Works . 48 The invader affects the character of Charles XII . of Sweden . 49 Mrs. M ——. 50 Whilst the author was writing this , he received the news of Mr. Samuel Richardson ’ s death , who was then printing the former part of the poem . 51 Mrs. Montague . 52 Mrs. Montague . 53 Mrs. Montague .
