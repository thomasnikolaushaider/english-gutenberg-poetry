     <p>Complimentary Pieces Addressed to the Author .</p>
     <p>1Well as the author knows that the following testimonies are not so much about as above him , and that men of great ingenuity , as well as our friends , are apt , through abundant zeal , so to praise us as rather to draw their own likeness than ours , he was yet unwilling that the world should remain always ignorant of compositions that do him so much honour ; and especially because he has other friends , who have , with much importunity , solicited their publication . Aware that excessive commendation awakens envy , he would with both hands thrust it from him , preferring just so much of that dangerous tribute as may of right belong to him ; but at the same time he cannot deny that he sets the highest value on the suffrages of judicious and distinguished persons .</p>
     <p>1 Milton 's Preface , Translated .</p>
     <p>1 These complimentary pieces have been sufficiently censured by a great authority , but no very candid judge either of Milton or his panegyrists . He , however , must have a heart sadly indifferent to the glory of his country , who is not gratified by the thought that she may exult in a son whom , young as he was , the Learned of Italy thus contended to honour .— W. C .</p>
     <p>The Neapolitan , Giovanni Battista Manso , Marquis of Villa , to the Englishman , John Milton .</p>

      <docTitle><titlePart>1 . ELEGIES ELEGY I To Charles Diodati. 1 At length , my friend , the far-sent letters come , Charged with thy kindness , to their destin 'd home , They come , at length , from Deva's2 Western side , Where prone she seeks the salt Vergivian tide. 3 Trust me , my joy is great that thou shouldst be , Though born of foreign race , yet born for me , And that my sprightly friend , now free to roam , Must seek again so soon his wonted home . I well content , where Thames with refluent tide My native city laves , meantime reside , 10 Nor zeal nor duty , now , my steps impell To reedy Cam , 4 and my forbidden cell. 5 Nor aught of pleasure in those fields have I , That , to the musing bard , all shade deny . Tis time , that I , a pedant 's threats6 disdain , And fly from wrongs , my soul will ne'er sustain . If peaceful days , in letter 'd leisure spent Beneath my father 's roof , be banishment , Then call me banish 'd , I will ne'er refuse A name expressive of the lot I chuse . 20 I would that exiled to the Pontic shore , Rome 's hapless bard7 had suffer 'd nothing more ! He then had equall 'd even Homer 's lays , And , Virgil ! thou hadst won but second praise . For here I woo the Muse with no control , And here my books — my life — absorb me whole . Here too I visit , or to smile , or weep , The winding theatre 's majestic sweep ; The grave or gay colloquial scene recruits My spirits spent in Learning 's long pursuits . 30 Whether some Senior shrewd , or spendthrift heir , Wooer , or soldier , now unarm 'd , be there , Or some coif 'd brooder o'er a ten years ’ cause Thunder the Norman gibb'rish of the laws . The lacquey , there , oft dupes the wary sire , And , artful , speeds th'enamour ' d son 's desire . There , virgins oft , unconscious what they prove , What love is , know not , yet , unknowing , love . Or , if impassion 'd Tragedy wield high The bloody sceptre , give her locks to fly 40 Wild as the winds , and roll her haggard eye , I gaze , and grieve , still cherishing my grief . At times , e'en bitter tears ! yield sweet relief . As when from bliss untasted torn away , Some youth dies , hapless , on his bridal day , Or when the ghost , sent back from shades below , Fills the assassin 's heart with vengeful woe , When Troy , or Argos , the dire scene affords , Or Creon 's hall8 laments its guilty lords . Nor always city-pent or pent at home 50 I dwell , but when Spring calls me forth to roam Expatiate in our proud suburban shades Of branching elm that never sun pervades . Here many a virgin troop I may descry , Like stars of mildest influence , gliding by , Oh forms divine ! Oh looks that might inspire E'en Jove himself , grown old , with young desire ! Oft have I gazed on gem-surpassing eyes , Outsparkling every star that gilds the skies . Necks whiter than the iv'ry arm bestow 'd 60 By Jove on Pelops , or the Milky Road ! Bright locks , Love 's golden snares , these falling low , Those playing wanton o'er the graceful brow ! Cheeks too , more winning sweet than after show'r , Adonis turn 'd to Flora 's fav'rite flow'r ! Yield , Heroines , yield , and ye who shar 'd th'embrace Of Jupiter in ancient times , give place ; Give place ye turban 'd Fair of Persia 's coast , And ye , not less renown 'd , Assyria 's boast ! Submit , ye nymphs of Greece ! Ye once the bloom 70 Of Ilion , 9 and all ye of haughty Rome , Who swept of old her theatres with trains Redundant , and still live in classic strains ! To British damsels beauty 's palm is due , Aliens ! to follow them is fame for you . Oh city , 10 founded by Dardanian hands , Whose towering front the circling realm commands , Too blest abode ! no loveliness we see In all the earth , but it abounds in thee . The virgin multitude that daily meets , 80 Radiant with gold and beauty , in thy streets , Outnumbers all her train of starry fires With which Diana gilds thy lofty spires . Fame says , that wafted hither by her doves , With all her host of quiver-bearing Loves , Venus , prefering Paphian scenes no more , Has fix 'd her empire on thy nobler shore . But lest the sightless boy inforce my stay , I leave these happy walls , while yet I may . Immortal Moly11 shall secure my heart 90 From all the sorc'ry of Circaean art , And I will e'en repass Cam 's reedy pools To face once more the warfare of the Schools . Meantime accept this trifle ; Rhymes , though few , Yet such as prove thy friend 's remembrance true .</titlePart></docTitle>

      <docTitle><titlePart>ELEGY VI To Charles Diodati , When He Was Visiting in the Country Who sent the Author a poetical epistle , in which he requested that his verses , if not so good as usual , might be excused on account of the many feasts to which his friends invited him , and which would not allow him leisure to finish them as he wished . With no rich viands overcharg 'd , I send Health , which perchance you want , my pamper 'd friend ; But wherefore should thy Muse tempt mine away From what she loves , from darkness into day ? Art thou desirous to be told how well I love thee , and in verse ? Verse cannot tell . For verse has bounds , and must in measure move ; But neither bounds nor measure knows my love . How pleasant in thy lines described appear December 's harmless sports and rural cheer ! 10 French spirits kindling with caerulean fires , And all such gambols as the time inspires ! Think not that Wine against good verse offends ; The Muse and Bacchus have been always friends , Nor Phoebus blushes sometimes to be found With Ivy , rather than with Laurel , crown 'd . The Nine themselves oftimes have join 'd the song And revels of the Bacchanalian throng . Not even Ovid could in Scythian air Sing sweetly — why ? no vine would flourish there . 20 What in brief numbers sang Anacreon's1 muse ? Wine , and the rose , that sparkling wine bedews . Pindar with Bacchus glows — his every line Breathes the rich fragrance of inspiring wine , While , with loud crash o'erturn ' d , the chariot lies And brown with dust the fiery courser flies . The Roman lyrist steep 'd in wine his lays So sweet in Glycera 's , and Chloe 's praise. 2 Now too the plenteous feast , and mantling bowl Nourish the vigour of thy sprightly soul ; 30 The flowing goblet makes thy numbers flow , And casks not wine alone , but verse , bestow . Thus Phoebus favours , and the arts attend Whom Bacchus , and whom Ceres , both befriend . What wonder then , thy verses are so sweet , In which these triple powers so kindly meet . The lute now also sounds , with gold inwrought , And touch 'd with flying Fingers nicely taught , In tap'stried halls high-roof 'd the sprightly lyre Directs the dancers of the virgin choir . 40 If dull repletion fright the Muse away , Sights , gay as these , may more invite her stay ; And , trust me , while the iv'ry keys resound , Fair damsels sport , and perfumes steam around , Apollo 's influence , like ethereal flame Shall animate at once thy glowing frame , And all the Muse shall rush into thy breast , By love and music 's blended pow'rs possest . For num'rous pow'rs light Elegy befriend , Hear her sweet voice , and at her call attend ; 50 Her , Bacchus , Ceres , Venus , all approve , And with his blushing Mother , gentle Love . Hence , to such bards we grant the copious use Of banquets , and the vine 's delicious juice . But they who Demigods and Heroes praise And feats perform 'd in Jove 's more youthful days , Who now the counsels of high heav'n explore , Now shades , that echo the Cerberean roar , 3 Simply let these , like him of Samos4 live , Let herbs to them a bloodless banquet give ; 60 In beechen goblets let their bev'rage shine , Cool from the chrystal spring , their sober wine ! Their youth should pass , in innocence , secure From stain licentious , and in manners pure , Pure as the priest 's , when robed in white he stands The fresh lustration ready in his hands . Thus Linus5 liv 'd , and thus , as poets write , Tiresias , wiser for his loss of sight , 6 Thus exil 'd Chalcas , 7 thus the bard of Thrace , 8 Melodious tamer of the savage race ! 70 Thus train 'd by temp'rance , Homer led , of yore , His chief of Ithaca9 from shore to shore , Through magic Circe 's monster-peopled reign , And shoals insidious with the siren train ; And through the realms , where griesly spectres dwell , Whose tribes he fetter 'd in a gory spell ; For these are sacred bards , and , from above , Drink large infusions from the mind of Jove . Would'st thou ( perhaps ‘ tis hardly worth thine ear ) Would'st thou be told my occupation here ? 80 The promised King of peace employs my pen , Th'eternal cov'nant made for guilty men , The new-born Deity with infant cries Filling the sordid hovel , where he lies ; The hymning Angels , and the herald star That led the Wise who sought him from afar , And idols on their own unhallow 'd floor Dash 'd at his birth , to be revered no more ! This theme10 on reeds of Albion I rehearse ; The dawn of that blest day inspired the verse ; 90 Verse that , reserv 'd in secret , shall attend Thy candid voice , my Critic and my Friend ! 1 A poet native to Teios in Ionia . 2 See Horace 's Odes ( i , 19-23 ) . 3 Cerberus , the guardian of Hades . 4 Pythagoras . 5 A son of Apollo . 6 Tiresias was gifted by Pallas with the power of understanding the language of birds to atone for his loss of sight . 7 The Grecian soothsayer at the siege of Troy . 8 Orpheus . 9 Odysseus . 10 “ The Hymn ” from “ On the Morning of Christ 's Nativity . ” Elegy VI . Anno Aetates undevigesimo. 1 As yet a stranger to the gentle fires That Amathusia 's smiling Queen2 inspires , Not seldom I derided Cupid 's darts , And scorn 'd his claim to rule all human hearts . Go , child , I said , transfix the tim'rous dove , An easy conquest suits an infant Love ; Enslave the sparrow , for such prize shall be Sufficient triumph to a Chief like thee ; Why aim thy idle arms at human kind ? Thy shafts prevail not ‘ gainst the noble mind . 10 The Cyprian3 heard , and , kindling into ire , ( None kindles sooner ) burn 'd with double fire . It was the Spring , and newly risen day Peep 'd o'er the hamlets on the First of May ; My eyes too tender for the blaze of light , Still sought the shelter of retiring night , When Love approach 'd , in painted plumes arrayed ; Th'insidious god his rattling darts betray 'd , Nor less his infant features , and the sly Sweet intimations of his threat'ning eye . 20 Such the Sigeian boy4 is seen above , Filling the goblet for imperial Jove ; Such he , on whom the nymphs bestow 'd their charms , Hylas , 5 who perish 'd in a Naiad 's arms . Angry he seem 'd , yet graceful in his ire , And added threats , not destitute of fire . “ My power , ” he said , “ by others pain alone , ‘ Twere best to learn ; now learn it by thy own ! With those , who feel my power , that pow'r attest ! And in thy anguish be my sway confest ! 30 I vanquish 'd Phoebus , though returning vain From his new triumph o'er the Python slain , And , when he thinks on Daphne , 6 even He Will yield the prize of archery to me . A dart less true the Parthian horseman7 sped , Behind him kill 'd , and conquer 'd as he fled , Less true th'expert Cydonian , and less true The youth , whose shaft his latent Procris slew. 8 Vanquish 'd by me see huge Orion bend , By me Alcides , 9 and Alcides 's friend. 10 40 At me should Jove himself a bolt design , His bosom first should bleed transfix 'd by mine . But all thy doubts this shaft will best explain , Nor shall it teach thee with a trivial pain , Thy Muse , vain youth ! shall not thy peace ensure , Nor Phoebus ’ serpent yield thy wound a cure. 11 He spoke , and , waving a bright shaft in air , Sought the warm bosom of the Cyprian fair . That thus a child should bluster in my ear Provok 'd my laughter more than mov 'd my fear . 50 I shun 'd not , therefore , public haunts , but stray 'd Careless in city , or suburban shade , And passing and repassing nymphs that mov 'd With grace divine , beheld where'er I rov 'd . Bright shone the vernal day , with double blaze , As beauty gave new force to Phoebus ’ rays . By no grave scruples check 'd I freely eyed The dang'rous show , rash youth my only guide , And many a look of many a Fair unknown Met full , unable to control my own . 60 But one I mark 'd ( then peace forsook my breast ) One — Oh how far superior to the rest ! What lovely features ! Such the Cyprian Queen Herself might wish , and Juno wish her mien . The very nymph was she , whom when I dar 'd His arrows , Love had even then prepar 'd . Nor was himself remote , nor unsupplied With torch well-trimm 'd and quiver at his side ; Now to her lips he clung , her eye-lids now , Then settled on her cheeks or on her brow . 70 And with a thousand wounds from ev'ry part Pierced and transpierced my undefended heart . A fever , new to me , of fierce desire Now seiz 'd my soul , and I was all on fire , But she , the while , whom only I adore , Was gone , and vanish 'd to appear no more . In silent sadness I pursue my way , I pause , I turn , proceed , yet wish to stay , And while I follow her in thought , bemoan With tears my soul 's delight so quickly flown . 80 When Jove had hurl 'd him to the Lemnian coast12 So Vulcan sorrow 'd for Olympus lost , And so Oeclides , sinking into night , From the deep gulph look 'd up to distant light. 13 Wretch that I am , what hopes for me remain Who cannot cease to love , yet love in vain ? Oh could I once , once more , behold the Fair , Speak to her , tell her of the pangs I bear , Perhaps she is not adamant , would show Perhaps some pity at my tale of woe . 90 Oh inauspicious flame — ‘ tis mine to prove A matchless instance of disastrous love . Ah spare me , gentle Pow'r !— If such thou be Let not thy deeds , and nature disagree . Now I revere thy fires , thy bow , thy darts : Now own thee sov'reign of all human hearts . Spare me , and I will worship at no shrine With vow and sacrifice , save only thine . Remove ! no — grant me still this raging woe ! Sweet is the wretchedness , that lovers know : 100 But pierce hereafter ( should I chance to see One destined mine ) at once both her and me . 14 Such were the trophies , that in earlier days , By vanity seduced I toil 'd to raise , Studious yet indolent , and urg 'd by youth , That worst of teachers , from the ways of Truth ; Till learning taught me , in his shady bow'r , To quit love 's servile yoke , and spurn his pow'r . Then , on a sudden , the fierce flame supprest , A frost continual settled on my breast , 110 Whence Cupid fears his flames extinct to see , And Venus dreads a Diomede15 in me .</titlePart></docTitle>

      <docTitle><titlePart>That Nature is Not Subject to Decay . Ah , how the Human Mind wearies herself With her own wand'rings , and , involved in gloom Impenetrable , speculates amiss ! Measuring , in her folly , things divine By human , laws inscrib 'd on adamant By laws of Man 's device , and counsels fix 'd For ever , by the hours , that pass , and die . How ?— shall the face of Nature then be plow 'd Into deep wrinkles , and shall years at last On the great Parent fix a sterile curse ? 10 Shall even she confess old age , and halt And , palsy-smitten , shake her starry brows ? Shall foul Antiquity with rust and drought And famine vex the radiant worlds above ? Shall Time 's unsated maw crave and engulf The very heav'ns that regulate his flight ? And was the Sire of all able to fence His works , and to uphold the circling worlds , But through improvident and heedless haste Let slip th'occasion ?— So then — All is lost — 20 And in some future evil hour , yon arch Shall crumble and come thund'ring down , the poles Jar in collision , the Olympian King Fall with his throne , and Pallas , holding forth The terrors of her Gorgon shield in vain , 1 Shall rush to the abyss , like Vulcan hurl 'd Down into Lemnos through the gate of heav'n . Thou also , with precipitated wheels Phoebus ! thy own son 's fall shalt imitate , With hideous ruin shalt impress the Deep 30 Suddenly , and the flood shall reek and hiss At the extinction of the Lamp of Day . Then too , shall Haemus cloven to his base Be shattered , and the huge Ceraunian hills , 2 Once weapons of Tartarean Dis , immersed In Erebus , shall fill Himself with fear . No . The Almighty Father surer lay 'd His deep foundations , and providing well For the event of all , the scales of Fate Suspended , in just equipoise , and bade 40 His universal works from age to age One tenour hold , perpetual , undisturb 'd . Hence the Prime Mover wheels itself about Continual , day by day , and with it bears In social measure swift the heav'ns around . Not tardier now is Saturn than of old , Nor radiant less the burning casque of Mars . Phoebus , his vigour unimpair 'd , still shows Th'effulgence of his youth , nor needs the God A downward course that he may warm the vales ; 50 But , ever rich in influence , runs his road , Sign after sign , through all the heav'nly zone . Beautiful as at first ascends the star3 From odorif'rous Ind , whose office is To gather home betimes th'ethereal flock , To pour them o'er the skies again at Eve , And to discriminate the Night and Day . Still Cynthia 's changeful horn waxes and wanes Alternate , and with arms extended still She welcomes to her breast her brother 's beams . 60 Nor have the elements deserted yet Their functions , thunder with as loud a stroke As erst , smites through the rocks and scatters them , The East still howls , still the relentless North Invades the shudd'ring Scythian , still he breathes The Winter , and still rolls the storms along . The King of Ocean with his wonted force Beats on Pelorus , 4 o'er the Deep is heard The hoarse alarm of Triton 's sounding shell , Nor swim the monsters of th'Aegean sea 70 In shallows , or beneath diminish 'd waves . Thou too , thy antient vegetative pow'r Enjoy'st , O Earth ! Narcissus still is sweet , And , Phoebus ! still thy Favourite , and still Thy Fav'rite , Cytherea ! 5 both retain Their beauty , nor the mountains , ore-enrich 'd For punishment of Man , with purer gold Teem 'd ever , or with brighter gems the Deep . Thus , in unbroken series all proceeds And shall , till , wide involving either pole , 80 And the immensity of yonder heav'n , The final flames of destiny absorb The world , consum 'd in one enormous pyre !</titlePart></docTitle>

     <p>Thyrsis and Damon , shepherds and neighbours , had always pursued the same studies , and had , from their earliest days , been united in the closest friendship . Thyrsis , while traveling for improve - ment , received intelligence of the death of Damon , and , after a time , returning and finding it true , deplores himself and his solitary condition , in this poem . By Damon is to be understood Charles Diodati , connected with the Italian city of Lucca by his Father 's side , in other respects an Englishman ; a youth of uncommon genius , erudition , and virtue .</p>

       <l n="101">Thus each persuades , but deaf to ev'ry call</l>

       <l n="149">We only , an obdurate kind , rejoice ,</l>

     <p>1 This Ode consists of three strophes and the same of antistrophes , concluding with an epode . Although these units do not perfectly correspond in their number of verses or in divisions which are strictly parallel , nevertheless I have divided them in this fashion with a view to convenience or the reader , rather than conformity with the ancient rules of versification . In other respects a poem of this kind should , perhaps , more correctly be called monostrophic . The metres are in part regularly patterned and in part free . There are two Phaleucian verses which admit a spondee in the third foot , a practice often followed by Catullus in the second foot . [ Milton 's Note , translated — W. C .]</p>
     <p>1 This Ode is rendered without rhyme , that it might more adequately represent the original , which , as Milton himself informs us , is of no certain measure . It may possibly for this reason disappoint the reader , though it cost the writer more labour than the translation of any other piece in the whole collection .— W. C .</p>

     <p>1 It has ever been thought difficult for an author to speak gracefully of himself , especially in commendation ; but Milton , who was gifted with powers to overcome difficulties , of every kind , is eminently happy in this particular . He has spoken frequently of himself both in verse and prose , and he continually shows that he thought highly of his own endowments ; but if he praises himself , he does it with that dignified frankness and simplicity of conscious truth , which renders even egotism respectable and delightful : whether he describes the fervent and tender emotions of his juvenile fancy , or delineates his situation in the decline of life , when he had to struggle with calamity and peril , the more insight he affords us into his own sentiments and feelings , the more reason we find both to love , and revere him .— W.

     <p>Though I had determined , my excellent tutor , to write you an epistle in verse , yet I could not satisfy myself without sending also another in prose , for the emotions of my gratitude , which your services so justly inspire , are too expansive and too warm to be expressed in the confined limits of poetical metre ; they demand the unconstrained freedom of prose , or rather the exuberant richness of Asiatic phraseology : thought it would far exceed my power accurately to describe how much I am obliged to you , even if I could drain dry all the sources of eloquence , or exhaust all the topics of discourse which Aristotle or the famed Parisian logician has collected . You complain with truth that my letters have been very few and very short ; but I do not grieve at the omission of so pleasurable a duty , so much as I rejoice at having such a place in your regard as makes you anxious often to hear from me . I beseech you not to take it amiss , that I have not now written to you for more than three years ; but with you usual benignity to impute it rather to circumstances than to inclination . For Heaven knows that I regard you as a parent , that I have always treated you with the utmost respect , and that I was unwilling to tease you with my compositions . And I was anxious that if my letters had nothing else to recommend them , they might be recommended by their rarity . And lastly , since the ardour of my regard makes me imagine that you are always present , that I hear your voice and contemplate your looks ; and as thus ... I charm away my grief by the illusion of your presence , I was afraid when I wrote to you the idea of your distant separation should forcibly rush upon my mind ; and that the pain of your absence , which was almost soothed into quiescence , should revive and disperse the pleasurable dream . I long since received your desirable present of the Hebrew Bible . I wrote this at my lodgings in the city , not , as usual , surrounded by my books . If , therefore , there be anything in this letter which either fails to give pleasure , or which frustrates expectation , it shall be compensated by a more elaborate composition as soon as I return to the dwelling of the muses. 1 — London , March 26 , I625 .</p>

        <l n="81">A modest youth , in love a simpleton ,</l>
        <l n="82">When to escape myself I seek and shift ,</l>
        <l n="83">Lady , I of my heart the humble gift</l>
        <l n="84">Vow unto thee . In trials many a one ,</l>
        <l n="85">True , brave , it has been , firm to things begun , 5</l>
        <l n="86">By gracious , prudent , worthy thoughts uplift .</l>
        <l n="87">When roars the great world , in the thunder-rift ,</l>
        <l n="88">Its own self , armour adamant , it will don ,</l>
        <l n="89">From chance and envy as securely barred ,</l>
        <l n="90">From hopes and fears that still the crowd abuse , 10</l>
        <l n="91">As inward gifts and high worth coveting ,</l>
        <l n="92">And the resounding lyre , and every Muse .</l>
        <l n="93">There only wilt thou find it not so hard</l>
        <l n="94">Where Love hath fixed his ever cureless sting .</l>
